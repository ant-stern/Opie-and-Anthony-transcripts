<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing a seemingly unresponsive security guard, transitioning into a conversation about racial bias in perceiving facial expressions.  This segued into internal company rumors predicting significant changes within a week, followed by speculation about the Facebook IPO and frustrations with online advertising.  One host recounted a prank call to women in online chat rooms. The death of Donna Summer was announced, sparking a discussion about her music hampered by producer E-Rock's unpreparedness.  Van Halen's cancelled tour was extensively analyzed, focusing on the band's internal conflicts, referencing past MTV appearances highlighting their tension.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of Michael Jackson's infamous "Artist of the Millennium" cake incident.

The next segment began with announcements of Amy Schumer (performing at the Stress Factory) and Morgan Spurlock (*Manson* documentary) as upcoming guests.  The hosts recounted a prank call made years earlier to Donna Summer, detailing increasingly absurd questions and a fabricated space shuttle trip prize. Jimmy Norton’s late arrival from LA was noted, along with comments about other staff.  The hosts engaged in banter referencing Chris Brown and Rihanna, comparing their radio skills to others, and detailing E-Rock’s meatball parmesan hero and iced tea consumption the previous night.  Robert Griffin III's personality and Hugh Laurie's *Tonight Show* appearance were discussed, along with the trend of actors forming bands.

A lengthy segment followed about the Amy Fisher shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco, including anecdotes about Joey Buttafuoco, his celebrity boxing matches (particularly against Arnold Horshack with Dustin Diamond allegedly inflicting significant damage), and Jeff Conway's alleged suicide note mentioning John Travolta.  This led to an analysis of Travolta's dancing style from *Grease* and speculation on his sexuality, along with the possible interpretations of Conway's allegations.  Amy Schumer then joined the studio, leading to a discussion of her experience with what she described as date rape at 17, including her emotional response and its lasting impact. The hosts and Schumer discussed the incident, the definition of date rape, consent, and the complexities of sexual experiences.  The conversation moved to Amy's current romantic life and the fetishization of trauma, concluding with a recap of the day's events.

A further segment focused on sexual experiences and infidelity, with Amy Schumer sharing a story about a past experience in a gray area between consensual sex and date rape. The hosts shared graphic details of their own sexual preferences and early encounters, including one host recounting his first sexual experience at 13 facilitated by his father with a 19-year-old woman named "Buzz," and Jimmy Norton sharing similarly explicit stories. The conversation touched on societal expectations and the psychological impacts of early sexual experiences, navigating relationships, and infidelity.  A cheesesteak delivery from "99 Miles to Philly" led to a side conversation about food and eating habits.  The show ended this section by discussing The Cramps and Irish folk songs, briefly mentioning a book ("Cheat") featuring stories from the hosts.

The final segment covered infidelity, men's grooming habits, and a discussion with a female caller about the emotional impact of infidelity, focusing on ego rather than physical intimacy. One host recounted sexually explicit conversations with a woman he wasn't romantically involved with, and discussed his changing perspective on infidelity.  Sexually suggestive banter occurred with Amy Schumer and a caller named Tostito.  A clip from a boxing training video featuring Henry Kelly was played. Morgan Spurlock then joined as a guest, discussing his documentary *Manson* on men's grooming trends, including body hair, manscaping, and cosmetic procedures, mentioning various celebrities involved.  A humorous anecdote was shared about powder on one host's testicles, and the segment ended with promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do that. Friday morning.  Yeah. And a good morning to everybody.  Hi, everyone. How is everyone today?  They can't hear you.  That's one of those rhetorical things, like I always do.  I didn't get a good morning, a good Friday morning, from the guy.  No, he wasn't at the podium.  I'm so upset. 
[00:00:30]  I want to call that guy out.  Oh, yeah?  I think it was yesterday.  He's at his post.  At his post?  With his hands up like this, on his chin, kind of.  Yeah.  Staring straight ahead where we enter.  Yeah.  And just like you said, I didn't get a good morning.  And then I look at the guy, and I'm like, wow, he's either dead or he's really sleeping hard.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  But he figured it out where if he positions himself in such a way, and there's another 
[00:01:00]  thing going on that makes it a little harder to see what he's thinking or what his expression  is, you know, because he's...  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay, good.  I got you.  You know what I'm saying?  Sure, sure.  But if you say that, people will go, no, you're a fucking racist.  But no, that's just a fact of nature.  You are racist.  If you're a bit darker in skin tone, it's harder to see what the expression is.  That's all I'm saying.  Especially if you're in the shade.  In a dimly lit room.  Well, he's in a dimly lit area.  Yeah.  In the lobby. 
[00:01:30]  I got to agree with you on that.  And as I was walking by, I'm like, oh, my God, he's fast asleep.  He's just snoozing.  He's snoozing.  Well, whatever.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Half this place is fucking snoozing.  Sleep at the wheel, as they say.  Have you even seen the Big Boss in months?  I haven't seen really any of them as much as I used to.  No, they're all just.  I think they're scattering.  They're all cashing out, I think.  Rats on the sinking ship.  I think they're cashing out.  Cashing out?  Mm-hmm.  Because there's. 
[00:02:00]  There's rumors amiss.  Rumors.  A few rumors.  Rumors.  Yeah, well, they're not rumors, really.  Well.  Something big is happening with this company.  There's speculation as to who or what entity will own.  Oh, I know it all.  This company, yeah.  You want me to tell you?  You want to predict it right here?  Sure.  Within a week.  A week?  Within a week.  A week.  Well, that's all.  You know what?  That's all I'm going to say.  Wow.  Within a week.  Tops.  That's a bold statement.  Within a week. 
[00:02:30]  That's my statement today.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Within a week is all I'm saying.  I don't want to get in trouble.  Well, but I know shit.  I'm just trying to figure out how I make money off it.  Yeah, right?  I'm not doing, I'm not touching that Facebook.  You're crazy to touch that Facebook IPO.  Facebook IPO coming out.  Out of the gate.  Does special people get the IPO or is it anyone?  No, you know how it is.  Oh, you have to be, you have to be invited basically? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, you got to go through your brokerage firm and their brokerage firm.  And, uh, uh, yeah, it's very, it's very difficult to get on board with the, the IPO price of what?  With 38 bucks a share?  They're talking 38 bucks a share.  A lot of people, a lot of people want in on this one because they feel like, oh boy, they missed out on the Google.  Yeah.  And we all know the Google is making people a shitload of money.  Yeah.  So a lot of people are like, well, that ain't going to happen again to me.  I'm, I'm in on this one. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  But they're saying on TV for it to have the same effect as Google, Facebook, A, has to be around in 10 years.  Yeah.  And B, it has to be worth about a trillion dollars as a company to same, to have the same effect as the Google.  That's a lot of fucking money.  Well, it's a social networking site, ain't it?  You know what I mean?  Uh, 10 years from now, that shit is changing quickly.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, it really is odd.  And people are visiting it less.  They are visiting it less, right?  Yeah.  I don't update mine as much. 
[00:04:00]  And a lot of people do not, uh, because they, they make their money off of the, uh, ads, you know, on the side of the screen there.  And they're not clicking on the ads, really.  They don't click on the fucking ads.  Right.  So, I don't know.  I click on them accidentally.  Yeah.  Like, you log on to a site.  And you go to click a link, and all of a sudden, the site shifts to the right a little bit for some reason.  And all of a sudden, you're in a Depends commercial, so I'm like, I would never click on this.  Not yet.  Not yet.  It was an accident.  I'm still good.  It happens to me all the time on, uh, with my iPhone. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Because I'll, I'll get a site up.  Yep.  And, like, Google.  I'll Google something.  Mm-hmm.  And then the results will come in.  And I'll go to click on the link.  Right.  And the whole thing will shift down a little, because something else will load at the last  second.  Right.  At the top of the page.  So, the whole page shifts down.  I wind up clicking on something I'd never meant to click on.  Of course.  It's so angering.  Oh, they got some tricks now.  Yeah.  It is.  And they're tricks.  They got some tricks.  They're tricks to make you fucking click.  Sometimes I just yell, and I just turn off the whole computer, because I don't know  what I'm doing at that point.  I don't know what I'm clicking on anymore. 
[00:05:00]  You get all mad.  I have been guilty of the voice coming from my computer.  Hi.  Which one of the, oh, oh, yeah.  Hi.  So, what do you want him, what, so what do you want me to do next?  You can't.  I'm like, where, where's that coming from?  Yeah.  And I can't find that fucking box.  I like that one.  Where you're like.  You're just, you're just fucking trolling around in here.  I'm doing a little.  Yeah, well, I, you know, I've been here a while, and.  Right.  Who the fuck is talking to me? 
[00:05:30]  Who, who are you?  What is that, and why?  Yeah, I'm doing a little porno action, but, you know, all of a sudden I hear a voice.  Hi.  You want that, don't you?  You like that, don't you?  I like what?  What?  What am I liking?  What do I like?  Who is this talking?  I know, are you actually live?  She's behind 20 open browsers.  I miss, I miss the old days where me and my brother were going to these, we would go  in these chat rooms on a boring Friday, Saturday night at his apartment, and just make the  girls do horrific things. 
[00:06:00]  We, we turned it into just a comedy show for ourselves.  That's when they were real girls.  Oh, yeah.  But they would do it.  That's the funny part.  Yeah, yeah.  We'd make them bend over and just spread.  Of course.  Shove things, do things.  Yeah.  We'd make them do goofy faces.  Just, just anything that would make us fucking howl.  Well, you should.  And you know what?  They didn't give a fuck because, you know, they were making a little money off it.  Yeah.  And we would just be drinking beers, laughing our asses off.  Anyway.  The, uh, the Facebook thing. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  38 bucks a share.  Uh, it's open to the public at 11 o'clock today.  That's when?  That's when trading starts under FB.  Uh, but, boy, people are saying, don't do anything the second this opens.  Yeah.  Don't do fucking anything.  Oh, you mean the 11 o'clock open?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that.  Just wait it out a little bit.  Wait it out.  They said wait it out about a half hour just to let it breathe and see what's going on.  Yeah, it's, uh, it will go up.  But I think by the end of the day, it's gonna, people are gonna cash out and try to make a few bucks. 
[00:07:00]  You think it goes, uh, lower than 38 by the end of the day?  I don't know if it'll go lower than what it's at right now.  I don't know.  What's the market gearing up to do?  Up?  Well, I know our, I know our financial advisor who I saw yesterday.  Oh, what did he say?  He's not, he, you know, he's a juh, and they like to keep it very safe.  He's a little conservative.  Oh, boy, he wants to just keep it very safe.  Was there any huge news that I need to know about? 
[00:07:30]  No, man.  Oh, good, okay.  No, I, we're, no.  I don't, no.  That's all I want.  He looks unhealthy as shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I hope he has a backup plan when he drops.  Oh, boy.  Fucking guy.  Oh, no.  I said at the end of the show, I had to meet this guy, and he was literally six blocks away.  He goes, I'm gonna be late because I'm waiting for a subway.  Who doesn't walk six blocks in New York City?  Barry.  You might not walk six blocks in Montana or something.  I don't know, whatever.  I'm just throwing a town out there, or a state, excuse me. 
[00:08:00]  But in New York City, that's like, you laugh at six blocks.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nothing.  Everyone walks six blocks.  Yeah.  Not Barry.  Not Barry.  He's like, I'm gonna be late.  I'm waiting for a fucking subway.  And they're very short blocks around Times Square.  Yeah, yeah.  Six blocks would take you less than a minute per block.  It's less than a five-minute walk, easily.  Oh, man.  And he's like, I'm waiting.  Oh, man.  And then he shows up, and he's still huffing and puffing.  I'm like, why are you huffing and puffing?  You didn't walk. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, I don't like that.  You know, people get a little desperate if they see the end coming, and they want to support their family.  And they grab a bunch of themselves.  Grabbing.  I'm sure we get ripped off by someone.  I have no doubt in my mind.  I know the company rips us off.  I wonder if our own people rip us off.  I don't know.  I hope not.  I hope not, too.  I don't want a Billy Joel situation.  Oh, man.  And I don't want to have to fucking pick up my tin snips.  Oh, my God.  Realize, well, all that radio you did over the years, yeah, you got nothing left. 
[00:09:00]  You got to rent an apartment.  I would start knocking tin again.  I would imagine Bob's desperate at this point.  It would probably take a little off the top.  He used to represent a lot of guys, and you know, his phone's ringing off the hook every day.  Where's my next radio job?  And the fact is, there's no radio jobs for nobody.  The whole business changed.  Oh, God.  I don't know, guys.  And I never saw it coming, even though it was so obvious to everybody that the whole business was collapsing.  No one saw it coming.  I just didn't see it coming.  Except everyone. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, God.  And I have no idea how to adjust to the new ways and the new media.  Yeah.  Oh, guys.  I'm going to go into negotiations with the same old horseshit, just hoping they buy it this time.  Oh, God.  I hope they buy it.  Oh, Christ.  I hope they buy it.  Go away.  I need a new guy.  Who wants to represent me?  Is that legal?  I don't know.  You don't know?  No.  I'm officially asking for new representation.  Wow.  Sam, you want to represent me?  Yes, I do.  Fuck off. 
[00:10:00]  Why?  Wanky hair, fucking attention horse, man.  Wait, you just talked to me.  No, I wasn't.  I wasn't talking to you.  You addressed me.  And we all saw this coming news?  Yeah.  All right, so the Facebook thing, we'll be watching that closely.  Yeah, we'll be seeing what happens.  But unfortunately, we'll be off the air when the public could get in at 11.  But I'm sure we'll tweet about it.  Of course.  That's why the Twitter is kind of cool.  The show kind of continues after we're off the air.  The Twitter?  But yeah, I don't know.  That's a very dangerous stock. 
[00:10:30]  I'm going to just hang out, see what happens.  I should ask my brother.  He would know.  He would know.  I wonder.  He's a day trading guy.  I wonder if he's day trading this thing.  I bet he's leaving it alone.  You think?  Yeah.  I'm sure he'll be up early.  I'll text him and see what he thinks.  Yeah, because I don't know.  This thing is...  Yeah.  But this Zuckerberg, he's going to be worth $19 billion by the end of the day.  $19 billion.  And that's going to make him, I think they said, the 29th richest man in the world at 28 years old. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, that's nice.  The guy...  This is what almost caused a breakdown in me this morning.  The guy was 20 in 2004 when we came back to radio.  Oh, boy.  Eight years later, he went from a college kid to being the 29th richest guy in the world.  And we're just begging for basic shit right here. 
[00:11:30]  Basically, he was a nobody when we came back to radio.  Wow.  Yeah.  So good for him, though.  Fuck it.  It's a good story.  A story.  Well, it certainly is.  Make movies of it.  Donna Summer died.  Oh.  She's claiming she got the cancer from Ground Zero, by the way.  Was she down there clearing the steel out?  Trying to find some fucking victims?  Was she down there?  I don't know.  Was she living downtown? 
[00:12:00]  Working the fucking site?  Was she living downtown?  Oh, I don't know.  I thought she was on the pile.  She definitely wasn't on the pile.  No.  But she's claiming she got her cancer from going down to Ground Zero.  Died at 63 years old.  Was it lung cancer?  Yeah.  Fucking lung cancer.  Did she smoke?  Not that I know of.  She did get very paranoid after 9-11 about the air.  She lived right near there.  She lived right near there.  And then she wound up getting it?  Oh, man.  Man, I went down there once, twice.  So she fucking was paranoid about it.  And she got it. 
[00:12:30]  She said the air smelled bad.  And she knew it was toxic.  And then she ended up getting lung cancer.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  That's scary.  63 years old.  Some kind of disco queen, I guess, huh?  Oh, she was the biggest.  On the radio.  Oh, ah.  She was the biggest.  Oh, ah.  Do you have that song?  In the day.  What did she do?  Last Dance was a big one.  Yeah, what else?  She was huge.  And then they had that.  She was huge in the 70s.  T-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca-t-ca. 
[00:13:00]  What is that?  Ah.  I can't do the high voice.  What song?  Maybe I'll help you out today.  What song?  What's the name of that one?  What's her hits, E-Rock?  Don't let us fucking flounder here.  You should have a whole list of her hits in front of you.  I don't know.  Some I Feel Love or something.  Bad Girls.  That's another one.  She had the Bad Girls.  She had the Last Dance.  Yep.  On the radio.  Radio.  We're missing one. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, why would E-Rock have all her hits ready to go?  Oh, my God.  There's the Dead Disco Queen.  She had a bunch of hits.  And what are you doing?  You're scrambling?  E-Rock, without yelling and screaming,  wouldn't you just put a nice little quick little Donna Summer list together just in case?  She only had five or six songs that anyone really cared about as far as mainstream goes.  That's something I don't think anybody should have had to tell you.  I know.  You're searching like a lunatic in there.  We see you.  No, there was another one I couldn't remember, but Hot Stuff. 
[00:14:00]  No, he didn't address.  He didn't address.  Why won't you address what we just said?  Why don't you have a quick little list of her songs in front of you?  I had the bit ready.  I didn't have the songs ready.  Do the bit.  So you just assumed what?  That we wouldn't talk about Donna Summer dying?  I want to hear her music.  He's still staring.  Turn off the lights.  That was a big one.  You realize I'm talking to you, at least, right?  Yes. 
[00:14:30]  Okay.  Why are you just staring?  Because I don't know what to say to you here.  He's just...  And then if I yell, then I got idiots yelling at me.  You have no idea what we deal with.  This is a classic.  What is it?  Is it a lack of sleep?  Because I know you're not dumb.  What happens to you?  No, I was looking for something else while you were talking about that.  You hang out here until, like, seven at night.  What do you do?  Tweet.  Why wouldn't you have a quick...  As one of the producers for the show, wouldn't it just be obvious, like, okay, the guys are 
[00:15:00]  obviously going to talk about Donna Summer.  They did a classic, you know, prank call years ago.  So they obviously might want to, you know, go to that.  But I should, just in case, you know, because I know they like to fool around with music and  shit.  I'm going to put a little list together.  So I'm ready.  It's like a pop it right up.  Right.  Yeah.  You're right.  I don't want to play it now because it feels... 
[00:15:30]  Do you know anything about Donna Summer?  I just know a couple of hits and that's about it.  What do you know about Donna Summer?  Nothing other than your bit and a couple of disc hits.  Yeah, somebody put together a nice list on Peltalk.  It took literally 30 seconds, right?  Thanks.  On the radio, Bad Girls, Hot Stuff, Love to Love You, Baby.  Right.  She works hard for the money.  Oh, right.  That's the one.  Last Dance and Dim the Lights.  Okay.  Dim all the lights.  See, a listener did your job in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Something that I think was very obvious to do today. 
[00:16:00]  That's good.  Hey, Belcher, if you want to come in and take E-Roc's.  We wouldn't be worse off.  All right, whatever.  I like how he doesn't answer that.  It's just...  That was my favorite part.  It's like, E-Roc, why wouldn't you have a list together of Donna Summer songs?  I have a song here that's...  No, you see what we just...  You've been at this for eight years.  Didn't address the question.  Like, your job in there, I mean, it's pretty obvious.  So you get things together just in case. 
[00:16:30]  But then if I yell, I can't win, so...  Why?  What happens when you yell?  Oh, they think I'm an asshole.  Who?  Some of the peeps.  No, you can't...  Not my people.  My people are the peeps.  You can't listen to the peeps.  Oh, no, I don't.  You've got to do what you do.  Just yell and scream.  If that's what you do.  I don't feel like yelling and screaming.  Plus, you're also just talking in the air because you just say these things.  And he just stares.  There's no response.  Look at him.  What a great defense mechanism.  He's like a fucking...  He's like one of those animals that just play dead. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  It's like you go up to him and he feels a threat.  He just rolls over.  But what he does, he makes believe he's busy, but I've been at this for way too long.  And he'll all of a sudden look at buttons and stuff.  I've got this huge board in front of me.  It does nothing, really.  No, you hit the mics on and off.  I'll fucking hit a CD player and I'll turn off microphones.  That's it.  I've got how many buttons here?  Hundreds.  And what E-Rock, I'll see, he'll try to get out of stuff.  He'll be looking at the board.  He's looking like he's working. 
[00:17:30]  Make him believe he's got to fade this down.  He's staring at screens.  It's like you're not doing anything.  I know you're not.  Look, he's touching something right now.  Yeah, there he is.  Look at that.  Why are you touching that button?  What does that do?  In case you tell me to play a song, I'm sitting here waiting.  No.  Turn your key, sir.  Right.  It takes literally a tenth of a second, if your hands are in your pocket, to go like this.  Bam!  It hits something.  Yeah.  But now his finger's on it.  You don't have to prepare.  Right.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:18:00]  E-Rock.  What are we going to do with you?  Are you going to wake up soon?  Sure.  Are you going to figure it out?  Are you going to get it back together?  One of these days.  Hey, E-Rock, is this going to get you a talking to from management?  You got a talking to?  I just assume every time we address something on the air with any of the people that work  here, they get a talking to.  Oh, really?  Well, who gives them a talking to?  I think the guys, well, you know, the babysitters.  No, I mean, who gives them a talking to?  The babysitters.  Yeah.  Because they're the ones fucking up Harry Bates and shit all the time. 
[00:18:30]  No, those guys that would give them a talking to are scattering at this point.  You know, the time we were all scared because Ant might have had whooping cough and no  one thought to disinfect the place.  It's great.  You know, things like that.  Basic shit.  Does this mean we're not going to get to hear any Donna Summer songs?  Oh, see, what happened?  Now it's just a weird thing now.  It's a good song.  Oh, what song were you thinking out of that group?  Is it I Feel Love?  See, I don't know that one. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think.  You wouldn't know it if you heard it.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you got that one?  This one was used in so many movies.  Was it really?  Yeah, like this.  That sound is like from the early 80s.  You could picture like somebody driving in a car at nighttime.  They're going through a tunnel.  Right.  And you're just kind of like.  This is early 80s shit, right?  That sound.  What year was this, E-Rock?  It's listed in the 70s folder.  It doesn't have the exact year on it. 
[00:19:30]  Well, when was Donna Summer at her peak, E-Rock?  Oh, I know this one.  I would say late 70s into early 80s.  1978 was a big year for Donna Summer.  Probably her biggest year.  She was, uh...  This is one of her, uh...  Slower...  Her disco-y, but...  Her vocal.  She did have a nice little voice.  She had nice cans.  Yeah.  You see her in the paper today. 
[00:20:00]  Old picture of her leaning over with a lot of cleavage showing.  She was one of those black chicks that white guys liked the way she looked.  And it was like, hey, I kind of like the way a black chick looks.  But then, as the years went by, uh...  Black chicks that white guys liked had to get more white looking.  Yeah, that's true.  So you look back and go like...  Like Delma from Good Times was one of those black chicks that white guys liked.  Right.  Remember this?  Yeah.  Actually, I didn't mind this dumb song.  No, this wasn't.  No, I'm not...  I'm not downloading it or anything.  This is a good fuck song. 
[00:20:30]  Back in the 70s.  Being a child of the 80s.  Jesus.  I can guarantee you this.  I was not fucking in the 70s.  You weren't fucking at all in the 70s?  Nope.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Because I was a child of the 80s.  Growing up and...  Wow.  And my penis was growing and getting ready for sexual activity in the 80s.  Wow.  I was fucking in the 19...  I was fucking when the Vietnam War was still going, I think.  Wow.  How old were you?  No, I was very young.  I think you might be older than you. 
[00:21:00]  My fuck career started very young.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Yeah.  No, it wasn't the sucky, sucky, sucky, fucky girl.  I wasn't in...  Wait a minute.  Let me make that straight.  I wasn't in Vietnam when I was fucking...  But you could have been, is what you're saying.  No.  I was not old enough to go to the NOM.  Where'd you go, Canada?  No, I wasn't old enough, I swear.  You know, if someone reminds me, thank you, I'll give you a little credit here, JD.  Yeah, JD in New York City is a regular.  Remember the rumors that Donna Summer was a guy? 
[00:21:30]  I do remember this.  Really?  She came out, and for a while, some people were thinking, is she a fucking guy?  Tranny?  Yeah, look at some of these pictures.  I don't know, she just looks like some chick.  She kind of has a tranny look to her on the left there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They were trying to figure out if she was maybe a guy for a while.  I do remember that.  That was before TMZ and all that.  Right.  And that rumor still got out there.  What an odd, divisive thing disco was.  Why? 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  It just took everybody, like, everyone was rocking, like arena rock kind of stuff, you  know?  Right.  Those big, fucking huge bands.  And then disco came out, and some of your friends kind of disappeared into that disco  thing.  Well, what else are you going to do if you're on coke?  Well, that's just it.  It wasn't.  A lot of people were smoking pot and listening to, you know, Charlie Daniels and Leonard Skinner  and all that shit.  Right.  And then, like, disco popped up and cocaine and stuff.  And everybody just, you know, things really changed. 
[00:22:30]  People hated disco sucks or fuck disco.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that whole thing?  There was a divide.  Yeah.  There was a huge divide in this country with the disco.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When Steve Dahl fucking blew up the disco records, his big fucking radio bit.  His giant bit.  Where he pretty much burned down Wrigley Field or something.  It was a complete disaster.  God bless him for doing it, though.  What was the first disco song?  There's a question today.  First real disco song. 
[00:23:00]  And what year was it?  It had to be 74.  Some fucking music historian knows the answer to this.  I bet it was, like, 74.  Who would you guess what it was?  I have no idea, by the way.  I'm just throwing that out there.  Claims to have been made by...  Yeah.  What?  The first disco hit?  Yeah.  Rock the boat in 1974.  Really?  That's what this says.  That's not the...  By the Hughes Corporation.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  The Hughes Corporation.  The fucking Hughes Corporation.  And now, Opie, that was some of your relatives.  No, trust me.  I had to hear this through school.  Because I went to school with a bunch of my brothers.  Hey, it's the Hughes Corporation.  See, because there's a band that's named that.  The Hughes Corporation coming down the hall right now.  Is this really disco?  You heard that when?  When I was in, like, fucking elementary school.  Oh, the Hughes Corporation.  Hey, you guys rocking the boat? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, no joke, man.  I forgot all about this until right now.  I had to hear that every Wednesday.  It was spaghetti day.  Yeah, we were the Hughes Corporation.  So they spelled it H-U-E-S.  Yeah, just H-U-E-S, right.  That's stupid.  It's a weird thing for a child of the 80s to hear.  This kind of has a disco feel to it.  Yeah.  It's like the beginning.  That string sound.  That string sound.  That's not disco. 
[00:24:30]  This isn't really disco, though.  This is kind of like one of those bridge songs.  Yeah.  Because wouldn't that be more R&B and kind of sort of soulish?  Yeah.  Wouldn't this be played on Soul Town on Sirius XM?  They said it was followed by Rock Your Baby by George McRae.  Oh, this is not a disco song.  Not even the beginning of it?  I don't know, but they're saying this is the first one, huh?  They say this was the beginning.  I don't hear it.  You don't think so?  Can you dance to this shit?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  I'm going to try it.  What?  Yeah, I'm doing it.  I'm discoing.  I fucking hate dancing.  I ain't dancing at the wedding.  You have to.  I'll slow dance and shit.  No, no, no.  Everybody's going to be able to dance.  I'm not dancing.  Everybody's going to be able to dance.  I'm not dancing.  I barely dance at my own wedding.  You should dance.  It's fun.  I let people dance around me at my wedding.  Have some fun.  Dance a little bit right now.  See, I don't know what to do.  It's Jimmy's bit, but I don't know what to do with my fucking hands when I'm dancing. 
[00:25:30]  Just feel it.  You know what to do with your hands when you dance?  No.  I don't dance.  That's the problem.  Like, what do you do?  Look at me.  I look like a fucking retard.  Yeah, that looks stupid, too, Sam.  No, people like it.  You got to do this.  Raise the roof.  Just raise the roof.  That's why they invented raise the roof.  That's why they invented raise the roof.  Yeah, yeah.  For us assholes that didn't know what to do with our fucking arms.  You can look cool and just fold your arms and rock a lady.  Oh, just kind of like. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucking.  Ah, shit.  Put your head down.  And the girls grind their asses in your crotch.  All right.  That's how it goes.  Like that.  I guess Tom in New York is saying rockers hated disco because of the drum machines they  used.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden drums went away and it turned into that.  Fakie drums.  Yeah.  But that also carried over into New Wave.  New Wave.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[00:26:30]  I disagree with the answer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It doesn't seem like the first disco song.  I don't.  I'm not feeling that as disco.  What was the one that really just put it over the top?  That was really disco-y.  They're going back and that's kind of.  I feel like that's more of a bridge.  All right.  Between, you know, genres.  I need that song where it just exploded.  Definitive disco.  We might have to go further than 74.  Right.  Somebody sang.  How about The Hustle or something like that?  Do The Hustle.  Gloria Gaynor's Honey Bee.  Honey Bee?  And that was in 73. 
[00:27:00]  73?  Gloria Gaynor was quite the disco queen also.  Yeah.  Honey Bee by Gloria Gaynor.  It says Honey Bee.  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds like a bee.  See, you could confuse old R&B with disco.  It's a little funk.  But unless it has those.  Yeah, funk.  This is like funk.  Unless it has those sweeping string sounds in it.  Right.  Horns.  All right.  That's not bad.  Some horns. 
[00:27:30]  And the guitar.  That chick-a-ching-tick it.  But that's also like funk.  Yeah, it's funk.  This is pretty disco-y.  This is pretty disco-y.  This sounds more disco-y than the Hughes Corporation.  The Hughes Corporation.  Let me think.  Shut up.  Ah, this is more disco-y.  Lock the boat. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  I'm going to try it.  See, I don't know what to do with my arms again.  Just kind of put them in the air like you just don't care.  That's right.  And then I do some dumb hip-boop and I look like a meteor.  I don't know.  This almost has a Motown-y sound to it right now.  It's true.  It was early, too.  It's 73.  73.  What about KC and the Sunshine Band?  Yeah, who knows this shit around here?  It's almost sounds like Turn the Beat Around.  Hey, guys.  Turn the Beat Around. 
[00:28:30]  Turn the Beat Around.  Love to hear percussion.  I don't know.  First disco.  That's weird.  That sounds more disco-y, though.  Whatever.  Donna.  Donna Summer died.  Donna Summer.  63 from Cancer.  We got one more if you want to try it.  All right.  What?  Soul Macosa.  They're saying this was one of the first disco songs?  By Cameroonian. 
[00:29:00]  As far as what?  One of the first disco songs?  Yeah.  They said 1972's Soul Macosa by Cameroonian Macosa.  So no one gets the credit for being the one that turned us on all to disco?  Because the Beatles, you know, rock and roll.  How we know it today.  Well, even that, people argue.  But, yeah.  But disco?  I don't know.  Yeah, because there is that weird kind of funk disco thing. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Now we're talking some shit right here.  What is this?  Soul Macosa?  Yeah.  But I can't find it by that artist, Sam said.  It's listed as somebody else.  Who's the list of this?  Manu?  The Bango?  Yeah.  That's what he was.  He was the saxophonist for them, so.  Beep.  Beep.  Don't you need a whistle if you have a disco song?  Oh, yeah.  Twink, twink.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  We don't need to do this.  Yeah.  I'm not feeling this.  We're losing fucking disco.  Disco sucks.  Disco sucks, man.  I got my disco sucks button.  I'm putting it on.  Nice.  On my fucking, my jean jacket.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we can stick with music for a minute here.  Because something happened yesterday that we said would happen.  Oh, yeah.  This was obvious to everybody, so we can't really take too much credit.  Some of the stuff we could take credit for, we are the first people to turn you on to 
[00:30:30]  some shit that's going to happen.  Oh, certainly.  We are seers.  But this one, I don't think we could take true credit for, but this made me howl all  day yesterday.  Yeah, this is so.  All day.  When I saw this on the Twitter.  Van Halen postponed summer tour dates, because they can't fucking stand each other.  Yeah.  And in January, when this whole thing came about, with that tattoo song, and Jimmy went  to the first show down there on, where was it, Cafe Wa?  Yeah, that small club, yeah.  Cafe Wa.  You know, David Lee Roth was talking to the audience, and they already were annoyed. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  They were kind of looking at them like, God, dude, come on.  Let's just play for these people.  Right.  And we said there's no fucking way these guys were going to get along.  Well, Van Halen has abruptly postponed all tour dates after their June 26th show in New  Orleans with no explanation.  Now, the funny thing is, it's coming out, they fucking hate each other.  They just can't get along, right?  Yeah.  But they're going to play until June 26th? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  You've got to go to one of those shows.  Because there could be a fist fight.  You're just going to see them hating each other.  I guess they don't want to blow off, you know, the shows.  I guess they have commitments.  They got commitments, and they sold some, you know, the ticket sales were pretty damn  good.  Yeah.  The band yanked more than 30 long planned dates, including shows in Milwaukee, Detroit,  Cleveland, Salt Lake City, and El Paso.  Most of the tour is promoted by Live Nation, whose reps wouldn't comment.  The band's rep also had no comment.  A source with knowledge of the tour tells Rolling Stone that Van Halen's members hate each other. 
[00:32:00]  As the source, the band is arguing like mad.  They are fighting.  So the whole fucking thing fell apart again.  No surprise, man.  Everybody saw this coming.  We said it back in January.  I know we did.  I know we could pull the tape, but whatever.  What could it be where they, even years later, they get together and just this hatred comes  out?  Well, I think David Lee Roth has a massive ego, obviously, and he's kind of... 
[00:32:30]  But after a while, even the guys can deal with it and go, all right, we know he's an asshole.  He's kind of oblivious to what's going on around him, though, I think, which makes everybody  uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And then you got Eddie Van Halen, who absolutely has an ego himself, but we don't talk about  it as much because he's not front and center like David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  And him and Alex are like brothers, and they're like, they're tight.  Yeah.  You know?  What's his name did the right thing by just staying away?  Yeah.  Michael Anthony?  Yeah, he just left.  He just knows.  Fuck this. 
[00:33:00]  That's what it is.  You got a couple egos.  And then David Lee Roth thinks that people want to hear him talking between songs.  But like, they should just know, look, we got a goldmine here.  Let's just do it.  I don't know.  They just can't.  Wow.  Amazing.  So if you have tickets for Van Halen, make sure you go.  Enjoy.  Because that's my next prediction.  You're going to see something fucking cool happens on that stage.  Last night, Van Halen, Eddie Van Halen hit David Lee Roth with his guitar. 
[00:33:30]  Something.  Yep.  Or David Lee Roth, if he could still kick like he used to, he'll kick someone right in  the fucking jaw.  I can't wait.  So that just makes me laugh, man.  Just hating on each other.  Absolutely.  So after June 26, we say goodbye to Van Halen again.  Again.  Well, maybe they'll come back.  And the tour was selling pretty well, too.  You think they'll come back in a few years again?  I think this is it.  But I think Eddie Van Halen will try to find another singer. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, God.  That never works.  But I think they'll try again.  No, it worked.  It worked once.  The Sammy Hagar thing definitely worked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a different band.  That's why it's tough to compare the two.  It was a very different sound.  But then when they went with fucking Gary Cherone.  Gary Cherone.  It was fucking over.  Holy shit.  That stunk.  We like Gary Cherone.  He used to do our show, too.  That was a big gig for him.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:34:30]  It's selling pretty good.  I don't know why they would say it's being canceled, says a source at the Mohegan Sun Arena  in Connecticut, where the band was supposed to perform on July 7th.  So these other shows are selling well.  Oh, they had other dates.  Oh, yeah.  They were selling well.  We're selling really well, says Jack Larson, vice president and general manager of the Energy  Center.  We're looking forward to it.  But guess what?  It's not going to happen now.  After June 26th, it's over. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  It's fucking over.  Amazing.  The Van Halen clips are live.  The Van Halen MTV Video Awards clip from 96.  We've played this a million fucking times with David Lee Roth in his pants all the way up  to his nipples.  Smiling like a retard.  Right.  And you can tell the band is extremely uncomfortable.  You want to hear this again?  Dating them.  Oh, I love it.  They're all standing there, standing ovation from people. 
[00:35:30]  And within a day of this, they were bickering.  This is 16 years ago.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I think we're here to present Best Neil Video of the Year.  Can you pause this, by the way?  Right.  The beauty of this, the band, Eddie Van Halen, you know, he pretty much runs the fucking band  with his brother there.  They agreed to do this.  Yeah.  Just because it would be like a holy shit moment. 
[00:36:00]  Remember when MTV went for holy shit moments?  Right.  So this was their holy shit moment for that year.  They had no plans.  No.  None.  None.  But David Lee Roth decided that this was a, this, there was more to this than just basically  them getting together to, you know, promote, you know, give out an award and have a holy  shit moment.  That's why this is so great.  So Tuesday.  Present Best Neil Video of the Year award. 
[00:36:30]  Right?  Dave's one.  Oh.  Dave.  No, no, no.  Instead of the best award thing, it's, we have to make an announcement.  It's just, we have to address this subject here.  This is the first time that we've actually stood on stage together in over a decade.  Eddie is, he's walked away.  He's so uncomfortable.  He walked away from the situation, but his hands in his pockets and his head down, like  any time this fucker talks, I want to kill him. 
[00:37:00]  They are embarrassed.  The best part before David Lee Roth went to the microphone, his, his mouth couldn't  be wider.  No.  He looks like an adult retard.  Yeah.  He's smiling like a dope.  Right.  A what?  A downy.  A downy.  A downy.  Sorry, I need to use the proper terminology.  A downy.  Yes.  Wait, you got to go back, Sam.  The first time in how many years?  I forget.  Decade.  Was it a decade, he said?  I think he said that.  The first time that we've actually stood on stage together in over a decade. 
[00:37:30]  He's hugging Eddie and it couldn't be more uncomfortable.  He's going to make everyone uncomfortable.  I'll do it for Al.  We're here to present the award for best meal video. 
[00:38:00]  Eddie just wants business as you can just get it over.  Have you noticed how things have changed a lot since the last time we were up here, really?  No, really, it used to be, I want my MTV, and now it's like, give me your MTV or I'll blow your head off, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay, we'll get to it.  Now they're trying to push him away from the money.  Yes.  Okay.  Hey, I got a line here.  Okay, this year's nominees come from all over the musical map from Beck to R. Kelly and everything in between. 
[00:38:30]  Ed?  Let's take a look at them.  He's just dancing and doing all sorts of weird shit on the side.  Oh, God, he's embarrassing.  September 17th show in Wichita, already sold out.  Really?  So they're canceling sold-out shows.  You know how much money that is?  What hatred.  You're canceling sold-out shows.  What do you got on this, Travis?  The best part about that MTV Music Awards clip is that it came out later that David Lee Roth thought they were back together. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, shit.  And he didn't know that Eddie Van Halen was still auditioning new singers.  Yeah.  So he was telling everybody, oh, yeah, we're back together, this and that.  And Eddie Van Halen is in the back talking to press saying, like, oh, yeah, I don't know what we're doing yet.  You know, like, I got to get a hip replacement.  And so the story goes is after they talked to the press in private, Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip. 
[00:39:30]  And the two almost came to blows, thereby shattering any chance of a first guy.  Don't talk about negative things like your hip.  Yeah, this clip is great, but you're right.  It was backstage where it all got crazy.  Yeah, and they never told him.  And Lee Roth really thought this meant, you know, we're getting back together.  We're going to tour.  We're going to put out a new record.  And Eddie was like, no, we're just fucking giving MTV a moment.  Like, holy fuck, these guys are on a stage.  It was to promote their greatest heads up, which went to number one after this thing. 
[00:40:00]  And so Roth started saying, like, I was part of some big publicity stunt.  They didn't want me, which is probably true.  Oh, it's probably very true.  It's like when Michael Jackson came out to accept, like, his birthday cake or whatever it was because it's his birthday.  And he went out to accept the Artist of the Millennium Award.  And it was, like, years after the Millennium.  Oh, how embarrassing was that?  That was with Britney Spears.  Yeah.  It was just the top of the birthday cake, and he turned it into an award. 
[00:40:30]  And he goes, thank you for naming me Artist of the Millennium.  And she just said it, like, you know, he's the Artist of the Millennium.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's, like, thought it was the award.  And everybody goes, what's he talking about?  Right.  Fucking dope.  He was, too.  Is that it for the clip, pretty much?  There's more.  I'll let me hear you.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  And the winner is, ladies and gentlemen, a big blast of noisy screaming nonstop summiter plummet New York City style applause for B-B-B-B-B-Bang. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, they hate him.  Oh, they fucking hate him.  I think there's more on Sunday.  Yeah.  And then doesn't, like...  Huh?  Doesn't David Lee Roth start commanding the attention back to him as Beck is doing his speech?  Oh, no.  Really?  It's going to the front of the crowd.  It was huge that year.  Fucking huge.  I would, uh, win this. 
[00:41:30]  Huh.  R. Kelly.  I thought that was...  Steel, uh, this is...  Best male award.  Beck.  You stink.  Not sure what that means.  Totally.  I like some Beck.  Beverly Roth is dancing behind Beck.  I am to make this video with me.  Yeah, we're back.  You assholes.  Yeah, we're back.  So he's thinking, hey, we're back.  He's so... 
[00:42:00]  He's so excited.  Gold Mountain.  You can't believe it's like...  Oh, my God.  He's acting forever.  Yeah, everybody.  Uh, Van Halen up here.  He's fucking dancing.  And wandering around the stage.  And then everybody who, uh...  All the other people.  I don't know what to say.  I...  I never won one of these.  Or anyone.  Nice.  That's terrible.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  That wasn't great.  You might have to get the, uh, the clip where Eddie Van Halen just starts fucking...  Yeah, kind of fucking telling David Lee Roth how it is in that press conference.  That clip's great, too.  Wow.  But, there you go.  Exactly what we told you would happen.  But the whole world knew this one.  Of course, yeah.  So, uh, if you're just tuning in, Van Halen is canceling.  All their tour dates after, what was it?  June 26th or something like that?  And they're canceling sold-out shows.  How's this? 
[00:43:00]  Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, you gotta see this.  Yeah.  Remember when Britney Spears used to be hot?  Oh, man.  What year is this?  This was 2000...  I mean, it was quite a few years after the millennium had turned.  It might have been 2007-ish.  Really?  That?  Maybe not that recent, but it was quite a few years after the millennium.  All right.  Hit this.  On such a special night.  And it's even more special because it just so happens to be someone special's birthday.  Someone special's birthday.  This is someone who has inspired me and just about everybody in this room and the world. 
[00:43:30]  2002.  I consider him the artist of the millennium.  All right, hold on.  This is 10 years ago?  10 years.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  All right, look.  Slow down.  Right there was where she goes, I consider him the artist of the millennium.  Now, how he confused that with, I'm getting an artist of the millennium award.  In 2002.  Selective hearing.  Like, oh, I'm the artist of the millennium.  That would imply that he's the artist of the current millennium.  Right.  That would imply that two years in, Michael Jackson's been named artist of the 2000s. 
[00:44:00]  This is the best MTV clip of all time.  Go back a little so we can hear her say that because she...  That sets up the whole thing.  It sets the whole thing up, right?  I wonder what they told him he was getting.  It was another one of those MTV just trying to come up with these moments.  So, like, hey, man, it would be cool to give Michael Jackson a cake.  You want a cake?  And Michael just goes, artist of the millennium.  All right.  Great.  Right.  It would be someone special's birthday.  Well, pause. 
[00:44:30]  Because I think what Michael Jackson is thinking is like, holy fuck, they're surprising me  with the artist of the millennium.  That's what he's hearing.  Like, holy fuck.  What a great surprise.  This is great.  I thought I was just going out there to accept a birthday cake.  It's great.  It's an award that MTV only gives out every thousand years.  Right.  And they put the award on top of my cake.  Right.  But that's what he's thinking backstage.  What's great is it's not a moon man, obviously. 
[00:45:00]  No.  No.  Right.  She kind of, you know, set it up.  And he went with it in his own dumb, stupid, entire fucking brain of his.  This is great.  He was going on sleep medication anyway.  Yeah.  Hit it.  And it's even more special because it just so happens to be someone special's birthday.  This is someone who has inspired me and just about everybody in this room and the world.  I consider him the artist of the millennium.  Consider.  He's a new innovator who pioneered the art of music video, broke down countless barriers, 
[00:45:30]  and sold more records than any other artist along the way.  So happy birthday, my friend, the king of pop.  So here comes Michael Jackson.  Oh, man.  There he is.  Look at him.  Oh, he looks all fucked up right there.  He's wearing chromium knee pads.  He pulls.  What if he pull off the cake?  Pause.  Where was that thing?  It's a bedazzled music note that appears to be a table decoration.  It's just something on the cake or on the table. 
[00:46:00]  It's the cheapest looking trophy you've ever seen in your life.  He, holy shit, he just pulled it off the table.  He pulled it off the table.  It was just to kind of decorate the cake a little bit, make it look a little fancier.  And people present you with an award.  You don't have to pick it up off the table as you walk out.  Next to your cake.  Well, this must be my trophy.  They bought it at Party City for a reason.  Right.  Can I see that again, please?  Yes, absolutely.  I love this.  He walks out.  He picks up a table decoration.  Yeah.  It's a centerpiece.  It's just on the side of a table. 
[00:46:30]  This is so fucking embarrassing.  That's great.  I love this show.  When I was a little boy in Indiana, if someone had told me, if someone had told me that one  day I would be getting, as a musician, the artists of the millennial world, I wouldn't  have believed it.  Well, don't.  This is really amazing.  You were smarter back then.  This gave the host and other comedians the perfect opportunity to...  What happened?  Or just some chick who thinks she needs to comment on it. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  That's why all the fucking dislikes on this video.  Right.  We'll play it.  Let's see what it says.  Make the peace.  I'd like to accept the artist of the millennium award myself.  I guess they're giving them backstage.  Everyone's getting them.  Not only is it VMA night, but it also happens to be the birthday of someone that I consider  to be very, very, very funny.  Fred Durst.  I'd like to bring him out right now.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Talk it.  The one and only Mr. Jack Black. 
[00:47:30]  Fuck Jack Black.  That's it.  Fuck Jack Black.  Jack Black came out dressed by Michael Jackson.  Oh, my.  Oh.  I love when Jack Black's over the top.  Oh, he fell down.  He fell down again.  He's ripping off these type games.  Wow, look.  Not one reaction from the crowd.  Oh, God.  You guys.  Stop it.  Seriously. 
[00:48:00]  Seriously, people.  Now he's screaming.  If someone had.  He just.  When I was a little kid.  That I was going to win the super genius of the universe award.  I'd have said, you're no way.  You're crazy.  And I've won it.  I won it.  Just ruined our bit.  That's.  Hence the dislikes right there.  He just ruined our bit.  We were having fun with the whole Michael Jackson picking up the centerpiece.  We were all having some fun.  And thinking it was an award.  Do you think anyone ever told him? 
[00:48:30]  How do you tell him?  Yeah.  They probably.  I bet all his people congratulated him.  Oh, God.  Congratulations, King.  Congratulations.  They call him Kings.  Congratulations, King.  Way to go, King.  You did great.  Way to go.  Honest of the Millennium.  Honest of the Millennium, King.  That's why you're the King.  Thank you.  What?  Oh, man.  And then he just touched a whole bunch of kids to celebrate.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't know, Sam.  Well, no, we do.  We all do.  I think we know.  Of course, we all know.  You sure we know? 
[00:49:00]  We all know.  You sure?  Yeah.  Martin Bashir gets vegetable juice where I get vegetable juice.  You don't give families fucking millions of dollars to keep their mouth shut.  Really?  If you haven't fucked their kid in the ass.  Unless you're the artist of the Millennium, which Michael Jackson is not.  Oh, right.  It was his birthday.  Well, how did it come out that that was all a farce?  Well, because people were like, what the fuck was that?  Like, I remember watching it live and being like, nobody said he was the artist of the Millennium.  Yeah.  And so everybody caught on real quick.  At first, people were like, did Britney screw up or did Michael just completely, and they 
[00:49:30]  were like, no, Michael just made that up off the top of his head.  If there was an artist of the Millennium Award, it would have been a huge production number  that would have had, like, video clips, and then he would have come out, it would have  been presented to him.  And it wouldn't have been a party favor.  Right.  A party favor.  Britney Spears would actually have the award, possibly.  It would have been like a gold moon, man, instead of a silver one.  It was made of the same material like those party favor tiaras are made out of.  Right.  Just that.  Glitter just came off of it.  There was glitter glued to it.  Where is that thing right now? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, man.  I bet that's worth some money.  I bet Michael had it buried with him.  You think?  The fucking artist of the Millennium.  The artist of the Millennium.  You want to take that with you when you go.  I think you're right.  I think he died because he never watched TV, and he died thinking he was the artist of  the Millennium Award.  He probably did.  He thought he was.  He just had a bunch of people around him giving him sleeping medication and telling him  he was the artist of the Millennium Award.  What a tool.  When he walked on stage, he looked a little sleepy.  Yeah.  How long was he sleepy?  A whole decade before it took him out?  Yeah.  Damn.  All right.  We'll take a break. 
[00:50:30]  We got Amy Schumer at 8 o'clock today.  I think...  Where's she playing?  Stress Factory.  Oh, fuck.  We got to sell some tickets for Amy.  I'm sure she's doing well, but let's make sure.  Yeah.  Let's make sure we sell a lot of tickets for Amy Schumer.  She's great.  Stress Factory, great club.  So that's a good combination.  And then we got Morgan Spurlock coming in, the documentary guy.  We go way back with him.  We used to do shit with him at N.E.W. before he was a big star.  Back in the day.  He made a movie called Mansom.  Mansom.  He's promoting that today?  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  With Will Arnett and what's his name?  The guy that was in here, Jason Bateman, are the executive producers of it.  And what is it?  It's like a documentary about men being handsome and grooming.  Oh, get Troy Kwan involved in this one.  Yeah.  And Eric.  Oh, wow.  And Eric, of course.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  He bleaches his hair and whatnot.  Hey, Eric, you ready for the rest of the show?  Yes.  You've had an hour to wake up.  That's good.  And our own Jimmy Norton, his flight was a little late, but he'll be in.  Oh, he'll be here any moment.  Yes. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Donna Sommer, a lot of people, when they found out she died, they were tweeting me about that  old prank call we did.  Does it hold up?  I don't know.  Remember that?  Does it hold up?  Yeah.  It was wacky.  It's nostalgic.  It's a little wacky.  It's just nostalgic.  A bit wacky, but it's...  But it's always funny to hear people be disappointed.  That is true.  All right.  Someone tweeted me...  The big way to have a life.  Someone tweeted me and said that they went to college with that lady's, I think, daughter,  they said.  Really?  They probably lied.  And this lady fucking hated us for years. 
[00:52:00]  But she was the one that was stupid.  Screw her.  No.  Just the quick setup when me and Ann were working at AF.  This goes back to 90...  I don't know.  It could be 96, 97.  The phone lines for all the radio stations were very similar.  So we would just get these random fucking calls because they misdialed and they were  trying to win a prize on another fucking station.  Yeah.  This was great.  It was like gold every time.  Ah, yeah.  We would get one of these maybe once every two weeks or so. 
[00:52:30]  We have a lot of these.  Yeah.  That happened to K-Rock when we were over at K-Rock, too.  Yeah.  We would get calls all the time.  From other stations?  Yeah, and you would take them.  People are dummies.  But we didn't get a prank call out of it like this one.  No.  This lady thought she called another station and she was winning...  I think it was Mix or something.  Yeah.  And she was winning Donna Summer tickets.  This is how it went down.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summers fan? 
[00:53:00]  Yes, but I'm more of a f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  There we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  Excellent.  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know. 
[00:53:30]  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on it.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right. 
[00:54:00]  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No!  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again!  You know what you're going to win now? 
[00:54:30]  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space!  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  It's beautiful, yes!  Fantastic!  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes. 
[00:55:00]  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello!  Donna wants to know.  Hello!  Oh, no!  Did she hang up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hit me with your best shot.  Why don't you hit me with your best shot?  Hit me with your best shot.  Fire away.  Come on, little, come on. 
[00:55:30]  You don't fight fair.  That's okay.  See if I can.  Knock me down.  It's all in vain.  I can't be back on my feet again.  Hit me with your best shot.  Why don't you hit me with your best shot?  Hit me with your best shot.  That's hilarious. 
[00:56:00]  Can we tell that on the air?  All right, good.  Hold on a minute.  Jim Norton has arrived from L.A.  I think we're doing a topical thing, though, right?  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Hit me with your best shot.  Is this Chris Brown and Rihanna's anniversary?  Yeah.  You know what?  You better just keep cool with that because he's a great man. 
[00:56:30]  Team Breezy.  All those idiots on Twitter whenever you criticize them.  Why don't you shut the fuck up, man?  Yeah, what's it, Wendy or something?  Yeah, that's good.  Well, that didn't last too long.  I'll double count them.  Ah, Iraq.  A lot of people are asking me.  They want to know what you did last night, that you're a little sleepy this morning.  They're begging me.  They're like, please ask.  They like your answers.  I really didn't do a whole hell of a lot.  Computer a little late?  What's going on?  No, lost TV.  Went to bed. 
[00:57:00]  What are you going to consider with?  Why is it when I hear Iraq on Sam's show?  He's all peppy.  Oh, I know.  He knows how to do radio.  How peppy.  Not always.  He's not monotone like this.  Not always.  He tells stories.  He tells stories.  I have to pull, though.  You have to pull as well?  For whatever reason, he gets in front of a mic and he decides to stop talking.  That's his thing.  Hey, Sam, by the way, I'm not going to sit here while you insult our fucking radio prowess 
[00:57:30]  that you could pull shit out of people, but we have to sit here and we're so inexperienced  and stupid that we can't get the likes of an E-Rock to open up.  That's right.  Tell us a story, piggy boy.  What I meant was, you don't have time to waste on E-Rock.  You are good at spinning.  You are good at spinning.  That's a good one.  Mundane question.  Damn, all right.  Fair enough.  About his night that he spent drinking Coke floats and writing fantasy WrestleMania cards. 
[00:58:00]  What was the treat of the night last night, E-Rock?  Last night was Meatball Parmesan Hero.  What time did you eat it?  It was like 8.30.  That keeps you up all night, man.  What was your treat, though?  What did you wash it down with?  Usual.  Lemonade Iced Tea.  Can't pick one.  You got to mix them up.  Yeah, have both.  And no dessert?  No, no dessert.  How was Dead Hero? 
[00:58:30]  Still half of it left.  It's delicious.  You know how good that sounds?  A fucking Meatball Sub Hero, man.  With minced garlic.  Yeah, can I take a little garlic?  Oh, God, him and that garlic.  Enough with the garlic.  A little garlic's okay.  Yeah.  But when you fucking bite into a fucking clove because you think it's a piece of cheese or  something?  We're getting the return of Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  Somebody who's been criticized for his breath before lives with his wife and eats garlic.  Sometimes it's a little dry. 
[00:59:00]  It's a little dry sometimes.  We have cheesesteaks coming in one hour from right now.  Why?  The Roland is jumping up and down like a lunatic.  I can't eat it, dude.  A little bite, maybe.  You got to do the cheesesteak.  I will.  You have one.  You got to have a cheesesteak.  You did great on the Tonight Show.  I did okay.  Have a cheesesteak.  It was not my strongest piece, but it was okay.  It was good.  It was all right.  Have a cheesesteak.  I got a DVR.  I'll check it out.  I'll check it out later.  I'm always one day behind your Leno appearances.  You know who was great on the show?  Is that Robert Griffin III? 
[00:59:30]  He's the fucking number two.  He won the Heisman.  He plays for the Redskins now.  He's a quarterback.  That fucking guy is.  What a great personality that guy has.  Really?  If he's a great quarterback, man, he is going to have a long, amazing fucking career.  In the NFL?  Just as a spokesman.  I don't know.  If he lives up to the hype, like a lot of these guys sometimes don't.  But if he does, his charisma and personality and he's funny.  You just jinxed him, though.  Now he's going to have some kind of injury.  No, you know why?  He'll be great because I got a picture with him, but I didn't get him to sign a ball. 
[01:00:00]  So that's why you know he's a Hall of Fame quarterback because I didn't get him to sign something.  Oh, why didn't you?  I didn't think.  Oh, you certainly didn't.  That's not thinking.  Hugh Laurie was the lead guest and he was also the band.  He's in-house as a band.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was it good?  It was okay.  I didn't really pay attention.  I was in the back with Jonathan.  But he's a fun talker.  Why are these guys obsessed with putting a band together?  There's a lot of them now in Hollywood.  Everybody on television or in the movies wants to have a band.  Billy Bob.  And everyone in a band wants to be in movies.  Kevin Bacon.  It's fucked up.  It is fucked up.  Costner. 
[01:00:30]  Costner.  Steve Martin.  Who?  Steve Martin.  Oh, yeah, that dumb banjo shit.  Yeah.  He gets awards for it, though, so what do we know?  I know.  I think he's a legit musician.  He's very good at the banjo.  He's legit.  He used to play the banjo on the grounds of Disneyland when he was growing up.  Good for him.  How about you tell some jokes in front of a sold-out show?  Yeah, he used to.  Sold-out crowd, I should say.  Hit me with your best shot.  God, is that really 20 years ago?  Amy Fisher fucking shot Mary Jo 20 years ago? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, I thought the song, I was going to go, it's longer than that.  No.  Fucking 20 years ago, Amy Fisher fucking shot Mary Jo.  My Joey didn't do anything.  I'm standing behind my Joey.  My Joey.  My Joey.  How did that work out for you?  Well, I don't think they're standing behind each other anymore.  Yeah, because of time, we could see how it worked out.  It didn't work out too well.  And Dice used to see Joey, but I met Buttafuoco once at the comedy store in L.A. years ago. 
[01:01:30]  But he used to hang out there all the time, apparently.  And Dice loves his neck rubbed.  And fucking Buttafuoco has hands.  They're like fucking bare feet.  Yeah, giant.  Giant mitts.  Yeah, you don't want to fuck with him.  No, man.  He's one of those fucking giant Long Island Italian guys.  He probably would slap you through a wall.  And Dice would make him massage his neck with his big thumbs.  He used to just rave about Buttafuoco's thumbs.  Dice loved his thumbs.  Smelt like Amy's pussy.  Just driving him in there. 
[01:02:00]  I went to Complete Auto Body once and got myself a t-shirt.  You got a shirt, right?  Yeah.  I got one of the Complete Auto Body shirts.  Went in.  I was like, could I buy a shirt?  And Joey was there at his brother.  He was like, what are you, extra large?  Because, you know, he's a little skinny guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Just went in there to get the shirt.  They're all smart-ass-y.  You still have that shirt?  No.  No.  He was ripped.  Look at him, man, with his fucking head.  When was that?  When he was doing the fight?  He boxed, right?  Celebrity boxed.  Yeah, he did some celebrity boxing.  Some of those celebrity boxing matches. 
[01:02:30]  Who'd he fight?  I don't remember who he fought.  My favorite one of all time is Horshack.  Arnold Horshack fought Screech, right?  Yeah.  And Screech beat the living piss out of him.  Is he the karate guy?  Yeah, Screech basically didn't tell anyone that he could basically beat any,  one up.  Yeah.  Because you're like, you're thinking, Screech, you can't fucking do nothing.  He had like 30 years on Horshack.  Right.  And fucking, uh, he pummeled him.  Oh, this is in one channel.  Is it? 
[01:03:00]  Remember the fucking mouse on Horshack's face?  His eye?  Horshack said they had made some kind of deal.  Horshack was down within two seconds.  And then he goes to run back at Screech.  Right.  Is it the best version of this?  First one.  First is not necessarily the best.  I guess we're going to have to play this.  He fucking beats him silly.  He took, they kind of, I guess in the back they had made some deal to not punch in the 
[01:03:30]  face.  Right.  And Screech immediately punched him in the face.  Well, Screech is-  So Horshack didn't know what to do.  He's an angry guy, that Screech.  Oh, he's so fucking angry.  Is he really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  We had a-  I remember having him on, but I remember him being angry.  Oh, man.  Horshack's just getting fucking tagged in the face constantly.  Yeah, Screech is kind of an angry guy.  He doesn't really want to go through life as Screech.  Horshack's headgear is twisted sideways.  He can't see.  Screech's punching him in the face.  He just fucked him up.  His face was fucking bad. 
[01:04:00]  And he had headgear on.  Yeah.  What about a Fuqua fight?  Was it like Amy's new boyfriend or new husband or some weird connection?  I don't know.  It was some weird connection.  Wow.  Oh, he just beat the shit up.  Horshack.  What's the ref doing, not just stopping this?  Well, he's not hurting him.  He's just-  Oh, man.  He's punching an old man in the face.  That's what he's doing.  You think this is on the up and up?  The ref was told, look, you got to let this go a little bit.  Because, you know, we're depending on some good fights here. 
[01:04:30]  People want to see celebrities beat the shit out of each other.  But Dustin Diamond's making faces at the camera like he's a badass for beating up Horshack.  Beating up old man Arnold Horshack.  Look at his eye.  He's bruised.  Fuck.  You can see it getting bigger as he's sitting there.  Yes.  Did Horshack ever claim that Vinnie Barbarino tried to suck his cock in the back of the Sweat Hogs classroom?  Fuck.  We didn't do that story yesterday.  We were so busy with Jim Brewer.  I know.  Kenicky.  Kenicky.  Jeff Conway, right?  That was the-  Jeff Conway's new story. 
[01:05:00]  He was claiming, and he wrote this in a suicide note in 2006, I want to say.  You know, he died last year of complications from pneumonia, I think it was.  Pneumonia, excuse me.  Was it?  I think so.  I think so.  But anyway, he tried to kill himself back in 2006.  He wrote this suicide note, and he basically said that he woke up because John Travolta was blowing him.  That's what he's saying, or I said in a suicide note.  Did he say anything, or did he just go,  I wasn't in a treehouse. 
[01:05:30]  He says he was traumatized by the whole thing.  I guess they were, you know, good friends.  Young fucking Vinnie Barbarino or Danny Zuko was during the grease years.  Why would you have John Travolta sleeping at your house?  Exactly.  What's going on there?  That's a little strange to begin with.  And then, I don't know, you wake up because the guy's blowing you?  Yeah.  I would just make believe I was asleep until I came.  Hey, you, get out of here. 
[01:06:00]  It's not Dave.  I can make believe I'm sleeping.  Oh, man.  Wow.  So where did this note come from?  Who uncovered this?  I don't know.  I guess while he was still unconscious and the note was fucking taped to him,  I guess someone grabbed it.  I don't know.  But they were able to bury it for this long?  Yeah, I guess.  So these allegations of these masseuses?  I don't have the story in front of me because it was yesterday, but what's in there, Sam?  You've got it in front of you. 
[01:06:30]  Well, this is coming from Conway's former fiancee, Vicki Lizzie,  who was talking to the National Enquirer.  He was so dismayed to wake up and find his friend giving him oral sex  that it ended his long relationship with Travolta.  Well, that'll do it.  Dismayed.  She claims that Jeff told me that John and Kelly's marriage was an arrangement.  Jeff said that Kelly knows that John is gay and that she's okay with it. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Because she might be, you know...  Got to love that cash, too.  She might be, you know what?  Yeah.  They kind of do some of that in Hollywood.  Yeah.  We don't know.  That's pretty presumptuous.  Just fucking gone.  You know what?  He's asleep.  Right.  You know what?  I think you're always on high alert as far as another guy blowing you.  Yeah.  Maybe he was fucked up on pills or something. 
[01:07:30]  He got to that stage where he woke up because Travolta was sucking on his hog.  69.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  This isn't good.  It was in the early 90s at Conway's home, is what Vicki Lizzie says.  Oh, all right.  Attempted to give him oral sex while he was sleeping.  All right.  I guess you assume that they're going to wake up and be like, well, you know, it kind of feels good. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, it feels really good.  God, I was just sleeping.  I had this sensation.  And it feels really, really.  Oh, my God.  My friend is blowing me.  Oh, my God.  My friend is blowing me.  Greased honey.  Go, greased honey. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  He's asleep.  I'm a creep.  Greased honey.  Yeah.  Getting lots of tin.  What?  Travolta's like, what's tin?  I don't like that.  You can tell when he goes, it's a real pussy wagon.  Yuck, greased lightning.  You can barely hear it, but he says it.  He says it.  Yeah, you've got to stop saying yuck after pussy wagon.  Yuck.  Greased lightning. 
[01:09:00]  And then what?  The other masseur is being represented by Gloria.  We'll get a rainbow decal in.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  How very good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, this story has legs.  Yeah.  People are looking for their money.  He's trying as a darndest to keep it all under wraps, but at this point, I mean, is anyone  surprised if he just came out and was like, yeah, I'm gay and stuff.  Like, I don't think anybody would care at this point. 
[01:09:30]  Like, for some reason, we care.  He can't do that now because he's in litigation.  Yeah.  Do you think it'll fuck up any roles that he would have gotten?  No.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah.  No, I think he would have got that Pelham one, two, three, whether he's gay or not.  So, he's kind of fucking it up on his own.  And he does really, he does really try to be so over-the-top manly in those movies.  Right.  But he looked gay in that movie with the big, with the mustache. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  He did.  That means you saw the movie.  It's a mustache.  I think I saw some of it.  I'm going to read.  I saw a clip.  That was good.  Very good.  I think anybody who watched, like, even Saturday Night Fever, you wouldn't know, a straight  guy can't fucking, just doesn't dance like that.  And sing?  Yeah, yeah.  He just, you know.  Dancing and singing is, I'm going to let it rip.  Some red flags.  The Grease Lightning dance was good. 
[01:10:30]  Especially if you could do the, yeah.  If you could sing and dance at the same time, that's a big red flag.  He's pointing, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,  And then they take that plastic wrap and run around the car with it.  Oh, I hate that part.  That's so fruity.  It's really gay.  They're all just having fun.  He rips the jacket off.  It's hot.  What are you doing, Rock?  What could be Grease Lightning?  Oh, God.  He spins.  Let's see. 
[01:11:00]  That's gay.  Fruity move already.  Oh, there's Kennedy with his fucking heart on the head.  Keep sucking.  Jeff Conway.  Look at him wiggling his hips.  I know.  His dance is very gay.  At least Kenickie doesn't look gay.  Blow, blow, blow, blow.  Yeah.  It's a good song.  It's a great scene in a musical.  You can't deny that.  It's a good movie. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  He's gonna cream.  You wake up and you'll scream.  Look how gay.  He's so gay in this.  Do you think he was even gayer when he was filming and the director had to be like, listen.  Exactly.  Stop putting the muffler in your ass.  Let's tone down the gang.  Oh, look at him prancing around.  He's prancing.  There, he looks like a man there.  They're all pointing.  Point, point. 
[01:12:00]  Nice.  Up, down, left, right.  Up, down, left, right.  He just keeps pointing at Jeff Conway's dick.  They have to tell him no.  Oh, yeah.  He's making it a fist.  Let's not hit the finger out.  Oh, there he goes with the fucking little legs back and forth.  That's very gay looking.  Oh, here it is.  The big dance number.  Yeah.  They're lifting him up on a fucking cable.  Oh, I hate when he runs around with the plastic.  You don't like the plastic running around?  Oh, now he's upside down.  Oh, the head.  It's pretty gay.  Yo.  Yeah.  Where's Jeff Conway at this point?  That's him. 
[01:12:30]  I'm having a condom.  It's like he's wrapping a giant cock with a condom.  Yes.  Do a condom.  Fuck, yeah.  Just imagine, if the rumors are true, how many of these dancers got blown during the  filming of this scene.  Riding the motor down between his legs.  Of course.  We get it.  What the heart of me.  Yeah.  Where's the plastic?  Oh, it's coming up.  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  Look out.  They had to tell him to fucking defruit the dance.  Jeff Conway's spinning the fuzzy dice around.  He just puts some cum in his hair. 
[01:13:00]  Greasing it back.  But Jeff Conway at least looks like a fucking straight guy doing this.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  John Travolta just looks really gay.  Yeah.  Oh, there he goes.  Look at this plastic.  Shrink wrap.  He rubbed it on his dick.  Yeah, why'd he do that?  He just rubbed it on his dick.  Now he's running around.  Yeah, Danny Zuko.  Plastic wrap.  Fuck Sandy.  That's why he blew her off in school.  Oh, yeah.  He wants some dick.  We're a little gay here.  Look at him.  Morganus.  Yeah.  See, a straight guy can't move like that. 
[01:13:30]  And it's natural.  It is.  It's natural.  Creep.  I think it's true.  He, Travolta, though, in this and Saturday Night Fever is a bonafide fucking sex symbol.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a sex symbol.  The chicks loved him.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, but now they're on that seat.  Come on, guys.  Let's get to it.  That is a great scene, though.  It's one of those very classic musical scenes.  Yeah, yeah.  Is this the one where he fucking sings on the beach? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, summer loving?  Yeah.  That's a good song, too.  Yeah, of course it is.  You got in her drawers, right?  Get in her drawers.  No.  Why would I do that?  And what's her name who was already 50 when she played the role?  Oh, God.  What the fuck is her name?  Dr. Channing is a high school student.  Yeah.  She was already fucking 50, I think.  More ridiculous than a straight John Travolta.  Oh, I want Danny to touch me.  We frolicked.  Danny.  Danny. 
[01:14:30]  Sorry, I kind of like the guys.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Like, did she have a cock?  Another good song.  It's a good movie.  It's a good music.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well-uh, well-uh, well-uh.  Tell me more, tell me more.  Did you suck on his cock?  Tell me more, tell me more.  Did he punch and boo your pussy? 
[01:15:00]  Uh-oh.  She's talking.  Uh-oh.  She got a crab.  Uh-oh.  I'm here in by me.  He got my suit down.  He's so damn.  Uh-oh.  Fuck his ass with a lamp.  She nearly drowned.  Where's Kenickie?  Because I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  I'm going down.  Oh, well-uh, well-uh, well-uh.  There's Stocker Channing looking. 
[01:15:30]  It's a middle-aged.  Was he pissed when you bite?  Flo-job jokes.  That's all you need.  Took a bowl in in the arcade.  Uh-oh.  We went strong to try to live.  Frank Lemonade.  Uh-oh, of course.  He got mad, because I don't have a cock. 
[01:16:00]  Did you know he was a fact?  No, we don't. 
[01:16:30]  Boy and boy meet.  Oh, oh, oh.  Tell me more, tell me more.  How much dope did he say it?  Tell me more, tell me more.  Did she put it in his rear end?  It's too cold. 
[01:17:00]  That's where it ends.  So I told her.  I prefer men.  You made a true love town.  Oh my God.  Who's going to come out of the woodwork now?  Oh.  Oh, the double show.  That's not bad.  Yeah.  I'm curious as to the sound he makes when a fist slips in. 
[01:17:30]  I just want to just pass it through.  Oh.  Oh.  He's so gay.  That's a high note.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Look at him.  He's so gay.  He's the gayest.  What is he doing?  Look at him.  He's so gay.  He's the gayest.  What is he doing?  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Don DeLuise.  By the way, text punch him on Twitter. 
[01:18:00]  Good face off joke.  Nick Cage gets his face back with cum all over it.  Fucking give yourself a gold star, text.  Bravo.  Oh, shit.  Fucking bravo.  So there you go.  Jeff Conway.  Yeah.  Wow.  Allegations coming out yesterday.  I'm sure everyone's got a story. 
[01:18:30]  A story?  Especially back in those days.  No, that was pre-AIDS.  Right.  I'm sure he was just like lucky.  Lucky.  Great.  He was raw dogging.  I'm raw dogging.  I could just suck anyone's cack.  Now you're a cunt.  Now Jeff Conway.  See?  Now you're a cunt.  Wait a minute.  I don't even think he liked that.  We'd still be friends.  Friends.  It's a good tune. 
[01:19:00]  They're all good in it.  It's a good one too.  What's the one she sings?  A hopelessly devoted to you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  It's a fucking great song.  He was going to sing it, but he couldn't say you.  He kept saying go.  Go.  It's every song in that play and movie.  Just a huge hit.  They're all great.  When that came out, that movie, it's all like PLJ in those stages.  Oh, God.  It was everywhere.  It was just fucking Grease songs.  Grease 2 was bigger.  Oh, Grease 2 was bigger. 
[01:19:30]  It was a bit of a letdown.  Yeah.  We're getting yelled at because we said that Van Halen canceled their tour.  They postponed it.  Why?  But you know what that means.  Oh, yeah.  No.  You didn't hear that?  You're flying.  Van Halen canceled all their tour dates after June 26.  And they got sold out shows after June 26 that they're canceling.  They're postponing the whole tour after June 26.  And the inside word is they fucking hate each other.  Really?  Just like we said on this fine show. 
[01:20:00]  We said this would happen.  Yeah.  They probably hate Dave's yapping.  But they're postponing it.  So I guess they're hoping that maybe they can figure something out.  That's all that means.  He's a stupid, stupid man.  He does yapping.  They hate each other.  Oh, no.  But Eddie's a problem, too.  Oh, yeah.  You know, David Lee Roth obviously is so over the top.  It's so easy just to blame him every time.  Yeah.  But Eddie and Alex, you know, they got their own egos.  We knew this would happen.  Yeah.  You were at the cafe where they were already giving him looks because he was talking a  little too much between songs.  I could feel it. 
[01:20:30]  You could feel it in the air, right?  Oh, my God.  Eddie was so annoyed at his yapping.  He just wanted to play a few songs for everybody.  You know.  So.  The Sabbath is doing it without Bill Ward.  That depresses me.  Oh, man.  Just couldn't work it out.  Can't do it.  Fuck, man.  What's up with Bill Ward?  He released a statement.  Just he thought that the dear deal is being offered was very unfair.  Mm hmm.  And it doesn't seem like it was a great deal.  Why?  I mean, I don't understand that. 
[01:21:00]  Like all those guys have so much fucking money.  So why?  Why not just do the right thing?  All right.  Yeah.  Here.  I mean, I'm going to guess their their thing would be the that you were there.  They're probably going to say the playing wasn't because he came out.  I was surprised.  He said that one show they wanted someone else to play most of the songs for him to come  out and do three.  Like maybe his playing is not.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I mean, maybe that's what they'd say.  Right.  But why would they have Bill Ward come out and do three songs?  Embarrassing. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  That's kind of insulting.  Yeah.  Unless he was just not playing well.  So who's going to be in the black Sabbath?  They didn't say everyone.  Everyone else except Bill Ward.  Yeah.  Makes me sad.  Hiomi.  How's he doing?  Seems OK.  Yeah.  I asked Ozzy.  How is he?  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  When you were just hanging out with him?  I asked Ozzy.  Yeah.  I asked Tony.  He's like, I should get fucking cancer.  He's playing great.  He's fucking Ozzy.  So of course you ate a fucking Ozzy.  Come on. 
[01:22:00]  We got Gilbert Godfrey reading Fifty Shades of Grey.  We just did this bit.  Yeah.  What happened?  We get no attention.  We suck.  But Gilbert Godfrey read some Fifty Shades of Grey.  That dumb book all the broads are reading?  Uh-huh.  That horrible one that we have recited.  Well, that'll be on the best of this weekend, right?  Iraq?  Yes.  When is that dumb show?  All weekend, I guess?  Off and on?  Throughout the entire weekend.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  So it's going to be one of the top bits of the week.  Just hammering the Fifty Shades of Grey book that the broads are reading.  Everyone's reading that book.  But all the girls around here are going crazy over that book.  What?  I don't get it.  How does that work?  I don't know, girl.  They're going to turn off and stuff.  I bet you they don't even do that.  Fucking chicks are dumb.  God, are you girls stupid?  I just...  Yesterday, every girl around here is talking about that book.  It's crazy.  What are we missing?  Well, we just want...  Tits?  Yeah.  I think guys are just more visual.  You just look at some porn, you jerk off, and then you're finished. 
[01:23:00]  If we tried to even treat them like in that book that they're so fucking hot on, they'd  be like, yeah, stop it.  Right.  Yeah.  Sam said something there, though.  Penthouse Forum.  Yeah.  You jerk off to that?  Never.  Wow.  Those were sexy stories.  I fucking did.  I was crying to it all the time.  And then you had some visuals with the girls.  I could use it.  I'd go back and forth, but those...  I could use it as a...  That Penthouse Forum, man.  That's great.  Wow.  It was a free limb, but I needed pictures.  You never read those stories?  It was a small book.  And get really turned on? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Then I would get the little...  Small book?  They were tiny magazines, really.  Not even a book.  I would jack to just the words.  Sometimes the words were good enough for me.  I had the pictures in my head already.  That's what's been lost is good, dirty...  There used to be this story archive called the ASTTR or something story archive.  This is obviously on the computer.  It was after magazines, like Penthouse Forum.  It was a story archive, and there was fucking probably 30,000 stories on this thing for 
[01:24:00]  these different collectors, and there was some amazing...  Every topic you can think of, there was some fucking vile ones, some gross ones, some  dirty ones.  It's like ASTTR, I think.  Every genre, everything you could imagine in your head, they had a story for.  I don't even know if it's still up.  Oh, I still absolutely like that shit.  Yep, there it is.  Yeah.  Old sex stories.  I think I did a little old sex stories back in the day.  Dude, this place was fucking...  Look at how many different collections there are.  Yeah, you would pick what turned you on, and then they had a million stories about it. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  What are some of the categories?  Kristen's archive was good, I remember.  Old Joe had a good collection.  Old Joe.  Good old Joe.  Yeah.  So...  But the girls, they got this Fifty Shades of Grey, and Gilbert Gottfried, good for  him, man.  He fucking read an excerpt, and everyone is talking about it today.  Yeah.  We got it right here.  Is this funny?  It's quick.  I haven't heard it, to be honest with you.  So, we'll see if it's funny right now.  Audible.com presents Fifty Shades of Grey, the erotic best-selling novel read by Gilbert Gottfried. 
[01:25:00]  My inner goddess has stopped dancing, and is staring too, open-mouthed and drooling slightly.  Hear it, the way it was meant to be heard.  Keep still, he orders, and slowly he inserts his thumb inside me, rotating it around and  around, stroking the front wall of my vagina. 
[01:25:30]  No fisting, you say?  Anything else you object to?  I agree to the fisting, but I'd really like to claim your ass.  The famed voice actor Gilbert Gottfried gives a reading that can only be described as sensual.  Holy fuck is this wrong?  By holy hell, is it erotic?  Let Christian Grey seduce you over and over again, through the voice of Gilbert Gottfried. 
[01:26:00]  But, when he hits my clitoris, I cry out loudly.  Oh, please, I groan.  Quiet, he orders.  Not taking his eyes off mine, he scrunches my panties in his hand, holds them up to his nose,  and inhales deeply. 
[01:26:30]  His hands reach around and touch my breasts, and my nipples pucker at his touch.  Holy shit, this is hot.  That's fucking funny, man.  That's funny as shit, man.  Holy fuck!  He's got a good one right there.  That was good.  Very good.  All right, we'll break.  We got Amy Schumer next, playing the Stress Factory.  They want to help her out.  I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  I think she's probably selling pretty well for the Stress Factory, I would imagine.  I bet she's getting all stress.  Why?  It's a comedy club.  Actually, she's promoting Sunday at Prospect Park in Brooklyn.  That's the date on her website.  I don't know which one she's promoting.  Oh.  I think she'd want everyone to go to the Stress Factory.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Oh.  And Morgan Spurlock a little later today.  And cheesesteaks in a half hour.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opinat 3 Show. 
[01:27:30]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  We're on the air.  No.  Just fuck with Amy.  I wouldn't do that to you.  You know that.  Perfect.  Amy Schumer in studio.  Oh, are we?  You all right?  Yeah.  Is your blood pressure back to normal?  It's all the blood in my face.  You would turn beet red.  Oh, my God.  Amy Schumer is going to be at the Stress Factory the rest of the weekend.  Yeah.  Vinny's Club down there in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[01:28:00]  I love that club.  I say it every fucking time.  He does a good job.  It's a great club.  He's a weird fucking guy, but that club is cool, man.  Yeah.  That club.  His wife is pregnant again.  He's going to have six brands running around.  What's wrong with him?  Yeah.  I'm like, have you heard of pulling out, Vin?  Put it on her chest.  Six kids.  Why?  Six.  I don't know.  I can't keep up with one.  He needs to stop breeding.  We should sign a petition.  I believe Vinny comes, his feet kick against the sheets.  Like little, like when a pig tries to run a linoleum, the little feet kick. 
[01:28:30]  His little feet probably kick on the sheets.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like he's trying to run on ice.  Makes a funny, wacky noise with that voice of him.  Oh, God.  He's so sunburned.  Is he sunburned?  He's so sunburned.  So he's enjoying his life.  He's just getting out of the house because he has so many kids.  Right.  He's just avoiding the house.  Oh, my God.  All he does is spill loads.  He's a busy guy.  Good for Vinny.  How was last night's show?  It was good.  Yeah?  New Brunswick.  This time of year.  Am I right?  Yeah.  The foliage? 
[01:29:00]  Go to Tumulties.  Yeah.  I just like, I don't know.  I kind of like going there.  Yeah.  It feels like the real world.  I like walking down the block to that dumb Starbucks.  Yeah, I did it yesterday.  There's a couple of dumb little restaurants there that have good food.  I don't know.  Did you say foliage?  Is it foliage?  Foliage.  Yes.  Thanks for letting it slip, Jim.  I didn't know if you said foliage.  Yeah.  No, you looked so joyful.  You're like, did you say you're a dumb bitch?  Good morning.  Hey, stupid.  Good morning.  Was that foliage?  Sorry.  I'm just proud I know it now because I used to say foliage. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  Foilage?  Remember, I used to get beat up for that.  That's how you put the fucking trees in the microwave.  We just have to cover them with it.  Right.  Stress Factory.  Let's go see Amy Schumer, please.  Please.  Couple shows tonight, couple shows tomorrow night, right?  Yeah.  No Sunday.  No Sunday.  All right, good.  The day of rest.  Yeah.  God took a break.  He took a breather.  Do you want to talk about that thing?  No.  Oh, my God.  Please.  No.  How about it?  Do you want to talk about it in general?  Like, without any details? 
[01:30:00]  How do you know it was the thing?  Okay.  It might not be the same thing.  Oh, you guys are so horrible.  It might not be the same thing.  No, we won't spoil any details.  I won't give any details out you don't want to give out.  I bet you guys were like the best date rapists in college.  Just come home with us.  We're going to watch a movie.  Like, we will not touch you.  Yeah, exactly.  Just the tip.  Yeah.  This hanky has my cologne in it.  Trust me.  Smell it bad.  Oh, God.  Were you a victim of date rape ever?  One of my boyfriends kind of raped me.  That's kind of how I lost my virginity. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah.  How old were you?  That's so fucking hot.  I was like 17.  I mean, that's horrible.  What happened?  Like, we were drinking and hanging out.  And then, and I passed out and I woke up and I go, we'd never had sex.  And I go, what are you doing?  And he goes, I thought you knew.  And I go, what?  Like, for him to say that right away.  Yeah.  Sounds like an Iraq excuse.  Yeah.  I think that kind of stuff happens.  But I think that kind of stuff happens.  Wait, he was already having sex with you?  He was having sex with me. 
[01:31:00]  And you woke up?  I woke up to him having sex with me.  Oh, no.  It's a magic time, Amy.  Yeah.  I was like, mom, I'm a woman.  I sat on her bed.  Did you have a certain glow about you?  Like, oh.  Blood.  Blood.  I had a little halo of blood around me.  That's exactly how you pictured it growing up, right?  Yes.  Just as you imagined growing up.  It was like Twilight.  Guys are really fucking heinous.  Were you drunk?  No.  I was a little drunk, yeah.  A little drunk.  Well, I guess I was asking for it.  Did he finish or did you stop him?  I stopped him.  I was like, hey, I thought we were going to. 
[01:31:30]  You know, I'm not.  Can we get a hotel?  Maybe go see a movie first?  Right.  Against plucking away any virginity or things like that.  No.  But you've got to make it kind of nice, you know?  Yeah.  At least pretend like it's consensual.  Right.  That's become my favorite thing.  Consensual.  It's consensual.  It's my fave.  It's the best.  Virgins do nothing for me.  No.  I don't like innocence.  No.  Not even if they're asleep?  No.  I like a sleepy slut.  I'm not saying I wouldn't fuck a girl who's been around the block a few times.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  But, wow.  So he was fucking you.  That's creepy.  I'm not trying to minimize that, by the way.  I don't think that was cool.  But it's been a long time.  Since then, I've had a nice array of cock.  So, yeah, I have no feelings left about it.  Did you see him?  I don't think that's cool to do, guys.  Not cool.  You didn't see him after that?  We broke up pretty soon after that.  Was it awkward?  But not even because of that.  It was, we went and visited a college together the next day.  Oh, that's nice.  You were just like, was it all that was on your mind? 
[01:32:30]  I was like, where I pee hurts.  Yeah.  It was all that was on my mind for sure.  Better than where your poop hurts.  That's true.  Yeah.  I should be grateful.  I should be grateful.  Yeah.  Did you feel like you'd been raped or was it because it wasn't violent?  You felt like it was just a weird thing.  It was just a weird thing.  That was one of those things that, you know, I felt really weird about it for a couple weeks  and then it kind of blew over.  And then years later I was like, wow, that was not, that's not cool.  Oh man.  You tamped it down for a few years and then came back and haunted you a little bit. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  A little bit.  I mean, I've never talked about it in therapy actually.  Oh, well you might want to.  Is that what this is?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Now a lot makes sense.  No, I never confronted him.  As far as you.  There's a lot.  People say to slow down and tell the story a little slower.  Yeah.  That's a slower.  You know, when we were growing up, I don't, I don't think the term date rape even existed.  No.  Do you think that qualifies as date rape?  It was like my boyfriend.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[01:33:30]  But they would, they might classify that as sexual misconduct.  Like legally there's a weird thing where rape I think has a certain amount of violence  and like when she says no, if you put it in any way, like there's a weird thing  with dating where it's called sexual misconduct where it's not, which it shouldn't be.  Huh.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a nonviolent rape.  Right.  But if she was like unconscious, that's fucking.  Maybe.  Yeah.  But then I also, I know people who, this never happened to me, but they're like charming  sex and then, and then the, uh, the girl falls asleep and the guy finishes.  Ah, right.  That's a gray area. 
[01:34:00]  That is.  I don't, I think I'd be like, what?  But I mean, I don't know.  I've never fallen asleep.  I've had like two guys fall asleep while they were going down on me.  Oh man.  I just like need them in the ear.  Holy shit.  Back to work.  That's hilarious.  What do you got nitrous?  Your pussy is boring everyone.  Your pussy tells bad stories.  I know.  Oh God.  Yeah.  No, we're just wasted.  Wow.  But that's another one of those things.  Guys wouldn't give a fuck if they were date raped.  Well.  That would be pretty tough.  By another man they would. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  But if it's by a girl that you would.  No, I would, I'd be like, oh, all right.  But like for you to be asleep, it seems so much more difficult to rape a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just different rules for guys.  I mean, I'll try it.  Give it a whirl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you were asleep.  You were fucking drunk.  Yeah.  You never talk about that in therapy?  No.  I've never talked.  Maybe I should.  But I don't.  The actual experiences of rape?  Yeah.  You might want to mention that.  You might want to bring that up. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, if you put it like that.  Wow.  What are you talking about in therapy?  Right.  And he wouldn't get off the phone.  The fucking phone calls.  He was 20 minutes late.  I'm in therapy, yes.  I was sleeping.  He wouldn't stop.  He'd just keep throwing that type of stuff in.  I can't wait to see the bullet points from today's show.  Amy's rape.  Yes.  Vinny's phone calls.  Amy's rape.  Which is worse.  The time is really hot.  Yeah.  No, that's the thing that's like, wow.  It's terrible.  That might have sent you down a road.  You think?  You might not want to be down.  You know, you pass out and the guy's fucking you.  That's one thing.  I don't know. 
[01:35:30]  First time-age.  I feel like I've been...  This could be completely insane.  I feel like sexually pretty healthy.  Yeah?  He goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah, really?  Are you healthy?  Why is that?  I don't know.  And make sure you speak slow.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I feel like...  I'm sure it must have done some damage, but I don't know what it probably does.  What makes you feel like you might be unhealthy or healthy?  Like, is it the detached, completely psychotic way you can just walk away from somebody? 
[01:36:00]  Is that the healthy part you're talking about?  Oh, my God.  That's great.  That is so funny.  I mean, I think I'm a sociopath, but not because of that.  Yeah.  It's hard to tell, though, with sex if it's like...  I feel pretty normal sexually, because sex is such a wacky fucking thing that could  go...  You know, you could take some areas that people would find repulsive and other people, you  know, that's totally fucking cool.  That's what I like, yeah.  But what... 
[01:36:30]  Is it something from your past that puts you on the road where you like this but don't  like this and stuff?  So it's hard to tell.  So it's hard to tell...  It's hard to use sex as a basis if you're fucking crazy or not.  Yeah.  Because it's so, you know...  Yeah.  And you know what?  I'm realizing I like...  Sometimes I like porn where the girl's sleeping and the guy wakes her up like that.  Oh, shit.  Well, you know what it is?  I think it's weird.  Where all those weird fetishes come from?  I think it's like...  Something happened to you.  Yeah.  I think it's like...  I thought of it as like that was like guiltless sex when I watch it now.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  But at the time I was like...  I remember being very surprised and upset.  Wow.  And upset.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like that Godfather II scene when fucking Don Corleone comes home and they walk in,  surprise!  Go show Carlo to rape.  It is, exactly.  A lot of questions coming in.  Brandon in Missouri, was Amy naked or did he take her clothes off?  I don't remember.  I mean, I don't think he would have undressed me.  It's tough to get jeans off if the girl's sleeping.  Really tough.  No, I didn't wear jeans.  I was another 15 pounds.  But if you like that sleeping sex videos, that's so weird. 
[01:37:30]  I do.  People fetishize, if that's the word, what hurts us.  You know what I mean?  That is weird.  We make it sexual.  What's traumatic.  Because there's a naughtiness to it, right?  Yeah.  It's a way of owning something that can be all-encompassing.  Yeah.  Or it's a way of controlling something which can be so crushing and damaging and hurtful.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a way of controlling it.  That makes sense.  But then all the other porn I watch has never happened and I do not want it to happen.  I know, right?  Like what?  I've... 
[01:38:00]  Like what?  I've never stopped myself from saying something in here and that was the first time.  Give us a good one.  Oh, man.  Interracial DP.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean...  Yeah, definitely.  But you don't want this to happen to you.  No.  But it's a turn on to watch it.  Yeah.  There's some of that shit in us.  Yeah.  I don't even like watching interracial.  I know you don't.  It's so disturbing to me.  Yeah.  Because all I'm thinking is what happened to her?  Where's that?  That she's there right now.  What did her ex do wrong?  Oh, man.  How bad did her ex fuck her that he sent her in this direction? 
[01:38:30]  Who raped her first?  Yeah, yeah.  She was sleeping at some point.  Is she like the interracial DP?  I've kind of gotten into some interracial stuff too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I've sort of taken a break from that.  I don't even like the white guys with the black chicks interracial.  Like, none of that gets me.  You don't even want somebody to have a tan.  No.  No.  I like pale English people having sex with each other.  They don't like Cousin Oliver.  Anthony can't come.  Oh, my God.  Just powder jerking off. 
[01:39:00]  Nice and pasty.  Shit.  It's terrible.  Oh, no.  Now we know why you're a comic and a funny one at that.  Oh, God.  There was so much damage way before that.  Come on.  That was late in the game.  I was like, get in line with the rest of this damage.  All right.  Hey, thanks for that.  Here's the other guys that damaged me.  Yeah.  Just stand on that line.  Sorry.  Yeah.  But, you know, it was a...  It was an experience.  That...  Did you watch Friday Night Lights?  No.  Sorry.  All right.  Well, there goes that.  Yeah, but people out there have, so explain it. 
[01:39:30]  Well, I just...  There's one scene with Connie Britton, the mom, and she's talking to her kid.  Her daughter's like, I'm thinking about having sex.  Uh-oh.  And she's young, and she's kind of like, well, if you...  She's like, don't have sex yet.  Like, you're not ready.  And she's like, why?  What's the big deal?  And her mom freaks out.  She's like, it can harden you.  And she, like, listens to her mom.  And I was like...  When I watched that, I was like, oh, yeah.  You know?  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah.  I think...  I think it did...  I think there is a good amount of that.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  I guess you can't avoid it.  How long did you date them before you did that?  Yeah.  We were together for, like, a year.  Well, it's hard to trust people after that, too.  When somebody you're dating, or you're supposed to be, you know...  Yeah.  A year, and you aren't fucking them, though?  Jesus Christ.  We were 16.  We got together.  I was a late bloomer, sexually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  He made up for lost time.  That's like being robbed by somebody, though.  That's like somebody you trust, and you love, and they fucking take somebody.  That's fucking awful.  How long did you stay with them after the fact?  Um...  Maybe, like, a couple months. 
[01:40:30]  And then we went to college.  Oh, that was the thing that kind of...  Yeah.  ...separated you to...  Well, not really.  Did you have sex again?  Ever?  With him?  No, no, I mean...  Yeah, we started having sex.  Not right after.  But what's in the back of your head, like, I know that was wrong, man.  I had to know that I wasn't ready for that.  I feel like I, like, I didn't...  I thought about it for a little while, and then I totally put it out of my head.  Right.  I think, yeah, that must have been, like, me trying to control it or...  Yeah.  I mean, the implications are just too awful. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  I mean, if it's a stranger at a party, that's one thing, but if it's somebody you're dating  and you're trusting...  You know, I just...  But honestly, I don't think...  I'm not minimizing it, but I just know so many girls that had experiences like that.  Dude, right.  Your back is lit.  People are like...  Guys are really despicable.  So many girls feel like they got date-raped in college.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So many.  It's so many, and then it's...  That's the thing.  It's like...  And, you know, they're always like, oh, people don't report it, because it's like...  I didn't want to send that guy to jail. 
[01:41:30]  Like, you know, he had been my boyfriend.  It's such a...  Yeah, it's such a gray area, but I know so many girls that it's like...  Because then, also, you know, then had I, like, reported or something, then you become  like this, and were you drinking, and were you whatever, and then you're the total bad  guy.  So it's just...  Man, it's a total...  Yeah, it's a total gray area.  Wow, man.  Fuck.  That's...  Light Morning Raid.  This is Light FM.  Yeah.  The fact that you never talked about it in therapy is weird.  It's gonna be taking your rape calls. 
[01:42:00]  Why don't you talk about it?  You might have to know.  I don't know, because I'm always...  I'm always in a relationship, and just having sex with that guy, and it's dirty with that  guy, but I...  Mm.  Like, it's monogamous, and I...  And there's, like, love going on.  Aw.  You know, but I mean, I...  It's not...  It's never...  I don't like real, like, lovemaking.  Like, I like to fuck, you know?  Right, right.  But it's...  I don't know.  I never...  I never stop crying.  Not a tender, loving...  No, I don't...  That makes me uncomfortable.  Really? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I don't like that.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  I wonder why.  Because Jimmy's like that, too.  Jimmy's talked about that.  Yeah, I...  I don't like it slow at all.  I go, like...  It all depends.  It depends on the person, and the mood, and everything.  Yeah.  Like, whether, you know, I'll change it up a little bit.  I mean, I have a good pitch repertoire.  Yeah.  I could go to the fastball.  I could go to the fucking knuckleball.  You got the knuckleball?  Sinker.  Yeah.  I've got knuckleballs.  Yeah, yeah.  Ow, ow. 
[01:43:00]  Jesus.  There are certain times where it's appropriate, it just seems appropriate to be a little slow  and more romantic and fucking corny.  Yeah.  And then there's just fucking bend over and, you know, let's get this done in five.  Right.  And fucking get out and do something.  I can only fuck really hard if I'm making noises like Al Molinaro from Happy Days.  If I'm holding her ass and I'm going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Imagine being that girl.  Oh, that poor girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right in her ear. 
[01:43:30]  What a treat.  Yeah.  What a treat.  Yeah.  I'm going to sink my teeth into her cheek.  I'm going to take fear.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Bite out a chunk of cheek meat.  Yeah.  I got you there, bitch.  Oh, God.  That's awful, Amy.  That's a terrible story.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I feel bad for you.  Oh, I don't want you to feel bad for me.  I do.  I feel okay.  I was so machine.  I think we should all hug you.  I'd rather we didn't.  I would be worse than me.  I'm going to opt out of the hug.  Is that okay?  We all have our shit, though, that we think should fuck us up. 
[01:44:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like, oh, is that why I do this?  It's like, but everyone's got that shit.  Right.  And it all like makes sense.  If you, there's always some psychologist that's like, oh, you have this.  And you're like, oh, fuck.  You want to be above it, but you're not.  Here's my deal is, I guess my dad thought, you know, I should have sex and be a man because  he didn't want me to become a homo or anything.  Uh-huh.  That was like his nightmare.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  So he decided on my 13th birthday, it was time for me to have some sex. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  And there was a girl that used to hang around the stable.  And she was, her name was Buzz.  What?  Is this real?  Yeah.  This story's been told.  She was home alone.  Yeah.  She was 19 years old.  Can I, can I, can I, I gotta just say, because I can't even imagine having sex at 13.  No.  Yeah.  I can't even imagine.  I imagined it a lot while I was jacking off.  No.  Well, we all did, but, but it was so intimidating for me. 
[01:45:00]  I was like, I wouldn't know what the fuck to do.  And his father's sitting there going, no, it's time.  He's 13.  And he needs to fuck.  So they went out.  They went out.  That's just amazing to me.  First of all.  13.  Like, what were you doing there?  13.  I didn't even have fucking Harry down.  Oh, Jesus.  You sure I didn't?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I was late for all that shit.  I was late.  I can't even imagine.  Yeah.  But anyway.  Oh, they, uh, no, they, they, uh, my father and his, his wife at the time, uh, took off.  They left the house and buzz was over and we're just watching TV. 
[01:45:30]  And, and she's like, Hey, why don't you go up and take a shower?  And I'm like, you're probably a stinky kid.  All right.  Well, I was at the stable all day.  But at that point, did you know that this was set up for you?  Nope.  You still didn't know it was set up for you.  What she said.  Not a clue.  Are we going to watch some TV?  Yeah.  Some TV.  I think Monty Piper was on.  I think Monty Piper was on.  I watched Barnaby Jones.  What a dope.  Barnaby Jones, geriatric gumshoe.  Jesus.  Uh, yeah.  She goes, take a shower.  So I went up, I took a shower.  And, uh, then when I, I come out of the shower and I'm ready to go downstairs, I like, 
[01:46:00]  you know, my shorts on and stuff like that.  I pass by, uh, my, uh, dad and his girl's bedroom and I hear, I hear, Hey.  And I'm like, this is weird.  It's out of context.  It's really hot.  She goes, why don't you, why don't you come in?  And I'm like, why is it still not even, not even occurring to me.  Of course.  And I look in the door and, and there's the image.  She's, there's Buzz.  She's sitting on the bed.  Is there a less appealing name?  Buzz.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:46:30]  She's sitting on the bed, uh, uh, kind of propped up her back with the pillows and  the sheet is over her lap, but she's got her big tits just sitting there.  And I look in, I'm like, whoa, I would have like, whoa, these are real live tits here.  I would have spilled jizz at the doorway.  Really?  I'm not even fucking trying to make a joke.  I would have lost my fucking mind.  Why don't you come on in?  And she pats the bed.  How ugly was she?  She worked in a stable and her name was Buzz.  Buzz at the stable.  She had nice boobs.  She had some big ass titties.  Big, nice heavy ones. 
[01:47:00]  And she was 19.  So she had the youth on her side.  I bet Buzz has seen some hard times.  Buzz is, oh man.  I always feel like she was a lot older.  19, 13.  No, I was 19.  So, uh, a four or a five?  I'd put her at a five.  Five?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And, and when you think back, it was, you know, the seventies.  Was she fat?  So she had a giant black bush.  Damn.  It was like a giant black hair.  It looked like a, yeah, a pool, a pool rack full of hair.  Right.  Oh my God. 
[01:47:30]  It was just giant.  It was a tumbleweed in your face.  But she was pretty good.  You know, she fucking-  Were you turned on?  Yeah, yeah.  When did you get done with her?  Everything.  She was like-  How long did you last?  Um, I lasted a while because I jacked off in the shower.  Cause I was jacking off like-  All the time.  Around the clock.  All the time.  And I think that's why my dad was probably like, you know, gotta get this kid laid.  He's fucking just jerking off all over the pool.  Tired of slipping and pulling back muscles all over the house.  God.  But yeah, that must have-  Yeah, that-  So it was like, whoa.  And then we had been- 
[01:48:00]  We kept fucking for like six months after that.  But did you know what to do?  A 13 year old?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't really know what to do either.  Kind of know what to do.  I mean, I had the basics, obviously, but I wouldn't have had any clue how to work the  She was pretty good with guiding.  You know, she was good.  She went down on me first and I'm just like, this is fucking great.  Did you go down on her?  This is so fucking great.  She wanted me to, but I was like, no.  No way in.  No way in the soundtrack.  I'm like, no.  No way in the soundtrack.  No.  I think she and your dad should be in jail.  I don't know if the statute has run out, but-  Yeah, it probably has, but that was some type of rapage, perhaps. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  I got excited because at 13, they gave me a 10-speed bike.  I thought that was terrific.  Oh, yeah.  I was watching Tiny Toons.  Yeah, exactly.  I got buzzed.  This is awesome.  It's just amazing.  You got buzzed.  I'm going to say that after every time.  You've been buzzed.  Oh, God.  That would make it even less sexy than it was.  Did Brother Joe get buzzed as well?  No, Brother Joe got this other bitch that was living down-  Same shit?  No, Joe was a little more-  No, I mean your father setting it up for the first time?  No, no, no.  Joe set his own shit up.  Joe was his own fucking man back then. 
[01:49:00]  Holy shit.  He was only like 18 months older than me, but he was a world older than me.  He was fucking picking up some 30-year-old broad that used to live in the same apartment  complex.  She had two kids.  He'd go over her house and be like, you want to listen to friend that comes alive?  And they'd put it on and just fuck.  How old was he?  Crazy.  He was 18 months older than me, so he was 14, 15, something around there.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  And then Buzz wound up knowing the woman that Joe was fucking. 
[01:49:30]  So we all used to go over this woman's apartment and just go into separate rooms  and just fuck away.  And then me and Joe would walk back to our apartment afterwards just laughing like, we  was fucking.  I was still playing army in the woods.  Cool your boys are doing some of that fucking.  Oh my God.  How do you even go to school after that?  That was the weird thing, going to school.  Teachers?  You're like, what do you want?  I couldn't even relate to anybody anymore.  I couldn't relate to any of the kids because like, I just want to talk about how great  fucking was. 
[01:50:00]  And they're just kind of, you know, hey, let's play some tether ball.  Like tether ball.  Let me tell you what my balls were doing last night.  They were laying across Buzz's fucking nose.  Oh my God.  Is what my balls were doing.  You started the story by saying that affected you in what way?  I'm not sure if it did, but perhaps.  Okay.  Perhaps.  Of course it did.  Perhaps I never advanced from Buzz's age.  Oh yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  You have a surprise.  Buzz is here.  Jimmy's like, ah.  And then it does explain. 
[01:50:30]  But you know what?  I think for a man it's less traumatic to be like.  Absolutely.  Because for a guy.  I think it is.  Why?  It's because of your patterns.  Because it's acceptable socially more and we're taught different things from a young  age.  And so a guy is taught that he has to conquer.  And a woman is taught that she has to be choosy and careful who she allows in.  So when a guy is kind of pushed into conquering early, that's more of an early high five into  masculinity.  But if a woman.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  If that like choice is taken.  If he's capable of it though.  Yeah.  I never felt like anything was taken from me.  I felt like I was giving something.  Yeah.  I'm generalizing.  I'm giving it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  And girls like you're it's so.  It's taking.  It's taking and it's so like just in your head just like don't be slutty.  Right.  Don't be.  And at a young age like the boys that you would see like they just try to get stuff from  you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They try to manipulate you into like just touch it or whatever.  And it's not a special thing for a guy.  A guy doesn't sit there and ponder like oh is my first time going to be nice and this 
[01:51:30]  is going to be a nice scene.  You just want to get out of the way.  You're just like when the fuck am I going to fuck?  Yeah.  Fuck.  I had a furry burgundy can go and I was half drunk.  I love Jimmy.  I was still in my white black kid phase when I was 18.  Oh God.  It was atrocity.  Yeah.  Let's let's do this.  Who was it?  A girl named Michelle.  She lives in Saudi Arabia now.  I saw her not too long ago.  She couldn't get far enough away.  Exactly.  She's like where is the exact other side of the girl?  No. 
[01:52:00]  She went to chop chop square and she threw her clit on the block.  She's like could you get rid of this thing?  I've seen some hard times.  Someone wrecked it for good.  She lives in a burka.  She doesn't want to make her eyes on her anymore.  Boy Jimmy.  You did a good job.  We're still friends though.  I mean I sent her into a medieval culture.  It's funny.  I fucked her eight centuries back.  It's really terrific.  Oh my God.  I was 18 in college.  How old were you Jimmy?  18.  Oh you were 18.  She was 15 or 16. 
[01:52:30]  18.  And mine had a birth defect.  We haven't talked about it in a while.  Did she have a cleft palate?  Oh my God.  No she was actually beautiful.  I had really nice eyes but.  Two baby eyes.  When I.  No.  She had the lid of my pussy.  She jerked me off like a T-Rex.  Yeah we just.  I fucked her.  We talked about Game of Thrones.  And you know with Dr. Steve being our friend I can finally find out what the fuck this  is.  I turned her over and she had a patch of not a strip I guess.  Oh the hairy brood.  It was a.  No. 
[01:53:00]  Well sort of.  It was a strip of hair that went from the back of her neck all the way down to her tailbone.  Dark.  These are the grossest stories of all time.  And Amy.  Dark.  Not just a little like peach fuzz.  This was a dark fucking.  She's like a dragon.  Yeah I know what that was.  I don't know what that was.  You fucked Chaka from Land of the Lost.  I was like what the fuck is this?  I've never seen it since.  Someone say an Armenian.  Dude.  She Armenian.  She didn't have a lot.  That's her deformity.  They're very hairy people.  No.  She didn't have hairy arms or any of that shit.  It was this dark strip of hair that went down her entire back in the middle. 
[01:53:30]  How about like.  It was fucked up.  Have mom shave it.  Yeah.  It's like a skunk.  Fucking good.  What is that?  Just a hairy chick.  Honestly.  No.  Cause there was no hair anywhere else really.  It was just defined.  Ugh.  Right down her spine.  I don't know if there's any term for it.  Can you find out if someone helped me out here?  Probably some pituitary problem.  Oh my god.  You fucked a monster.  Yeah you fucked.  It's probably just that you fucked a monster. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I don't even really remember much about it at this point.  I remember it was awesome and all that.  But I don't have any real details.  And when I think back at it.  It wasn't just a one thing.  And then it was like alright.  And now I gotta like wonder about it and think about it.  We fucked for months afterwards.  Like every morning she would come over before school.  Jesus.  And like when my dad and Corey would leave.  Right.  Like she would come over the house and just jump into bed.  That's fucking awesome.  And like fucking I would go to school smelling like vagina. 
[01:54:30]  How the fuck do you wrap your head around that at 13?  Oh wow.  No.  Oh fuck yeah.  That's why I started screwing up at school too.  Did your dad start smiling at you?  No.  He still was you know trying to keep me from being a faggot.  Oh my god.  He still wasn't convinced.  That was his job.  Even though the 19 year old was coming over every day.  That was his job.  Boy if I liked cock I could have gotten really gotten better.  Was he worried about Joe as well?  No.  No.  I was the sensitive like cry baby kid.  So he looked at me and thought uh oh. 
[01:55:00]  I got one.  There's potential that this kid's gonna become a homo.  So he put me in what he called man training.  Oh my god.  It's like yeah you know now you gotta do this and ride horses and you know fucking.  Like no offense I'm sure you were like a dope 13 year old but what was in it for Buzz?  Like why did this chick.  I.  Look.  I fucking did anything after a couple of months.  I went down on that big hairy fucking bush.  Oh man.  I licked that thing like it was a fucking lollipop. 
[01:55:30]  A 13 year old.  13.  Yeah.  He was in college.  I don't know.  Yeah.  No.  College.  Sorry.  Stable college.  Hilarious.  She was getting her air conditioning degree.  I don't know.  Are you still around?  I think when she uh.  Oh my god.  Does she have a Facebook?  I would love to see her.  Last I heard she was uh.  Living uh.  With some sailor in San Diego.  Really?  Oh no.  Yeah.  Vic Tabak is fucking your.  First love.  First love.  Funny. 
[01:56:00]  Gunner.  Here come the jokes.  Gunner.  Uh.  She was a werewolf.  Uh.  Did she disappear during full moon?  Could have been.  I want to know what the hairy.  He had sex with Lon Chaney.  Well.  Uh.  What is this guy trying to do?  Let's go to Richard in New Hampshire.  Richard.  What's up?  Hey Opa.  Uh.  I had a friend of mine in school that was called the Bacchus Divas.  He had this great big hairy patch on his chest.  No other hair elsewhere.  But a great big patch of hair on his chest that was off to one side. 
[01:56:30]  It looked really weird.  How I remember it.  Don't you fuck that guy?  Yeah.  How I remember it.  It was right down her spine though man.  Oh yeah.  Well defined.  Well I think it's just simply a hairy patch and I have no idea how to spell it.  That was weird.  Why wouldn't you shave that thing?  Maybe she couldn't reach back there.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Alright.  That's all I got.  Thank you.  Spray some nair on the bed and just roll around.  Right.  With your back.  Yeah.  Hey we got cheesesteaks outside.  What?  You hungry Amy? 
[01:57:00]  I got this oatmeal going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a little different than cheesesteaks.  Wow.  I might have a bite just to get my gassers going for later.  Oh great Jimmy.  Don't get your hopes up.  It'll be a while.  It'll be a while.  I say farts.  We were talking about food and how if you're not in that city the foods, you know what I  mean they can't.  Having it out of that city?  Right.  Like cheesesteaks in New York City is crazy because Philly's known for their cheesesteaks  and I've never found a place where they do it right.  Yeah.  And these guys called and said fuck that.  We make fucking Philly cheesesteaks right here in Manhattan and they're good. 
[01:57:30]  Alright.  Right Roland?  Delicious.  I don't know.  Have you had one already?  Tons of them.  Before.  Not before.  Not before.  Oh before?  Who are these guys?  How come you guys aren't fat?  They look like normal guys.  Yeah.  You don't eat the cheesesteaks obviously.  Flirting with the cheesesteak guys.  Hey you guys.  Hey you guys.  I don't know if you like guys.  She puts her head over her shelf.  She's like hey you guys.  Hey you guys.  I don't know if you guys like consensual sex but I don't.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Just slip a roofie in her oatmeal and you'll have her. 
[01:58:00]  By the way.  She goes off.  And she won't even report it.  I hate the way Amy is dutifully doling out the little treats into her oatmeal as she  goes layer by layer.  Yes, yes.  And then she'll eat the treats off of it and then add more treats.  She's actually layering her way down like a geologist that's really enraging me.  Oh my god.  Being very careful.  I'm going to launch into how you eat in a second.  Well, why are you holding back?  Yeah, feel free. 
[01:58:30]  We've all seen it.  Oh my god.  It's terrible.  I can't.  I have very good eating habits.  You like Caesar salads.  Oh, Jesus.  We've all noticed.  He loves his Caesar salad.  He needs it right away when we eat.  Like it needs to come out immediately as soon as we sit down.  Watching any of you guys order is infuriating.  Why?  You, Keith, Bobby.  I'm very specific.  Your points are in that.  My interest is like, fuck you.  I have to.  I'm getting older.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Cheese steak, guys.  Where are you from? 
[01:59:00]  New York.  No, I know.  Don't you want people to know the business?  Oh, the store is 99 miles to Philly.  Where is it?  We're in the East Village on 3rd Avenue between 12 and 13.  That's what we need.  See?  I thought they came up from Philly.  Yeah, no, no, no.  That's the key to this whole thing.  We're 99 miles to Philly.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Where do you get the bread?  Do you ever think of moving a mile?  I'm from Philly.  We get it from Amoroso, which is the best bread down there.  So you get it shipped up.  We get it shipped out.  That's what we were talking about. 
[01:59:30]  I see.  You got to ship the good shit in.  Why would you just ship up the bread instead of trying to make it in Manhattan?  What makes the bread so good down there?  The water?  Just like here with your bagels, there's something with the water.  Sure.  It's a hearth-baked roll.  So it's similar to most Italian breads.  It's a nice hearth-baked roll.  A hearth-baked roll.  Yeah.  What's a hearth-baked roll?  I don't know.  What's a hearth?  A hearth.  Isn't that the fucking stone thing in front of a fireplace?  Turn the hearth on. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  Just how they bake each piece.  No, it's a great roll that just holds everything together and makes it what it is.  Makes it what it is.  This guy's all about rolls.  What about the rolls?  A lot about bread.  What about the cheese?  Not really.  Cheese is standard.  We use Cheez Whiz, American or Provolone.  Cheez Whiz.  Yeah, that's all it is.  That's the stuff.  Delicious, natural.  What about the meat?  Meat.  Topped sirloin.  Walk us through the meat.  Chopped.  Chopped.  Yes.  Sirloin.  How about you hand these things out? 
[02:00:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm only having a little bite of one.  No, you're not.  As soon as you have a little bite.  I've eaten on the plane.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you eat on the plane?  It was a salmon salad.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  Salmon on the plane?  On that fucking flight I will.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  It's a good one.  It's a gentleman's flight.  Yeah.  Woo.  Yeah.  Was the salmon good?  It was.  It was delightful.  You guys got all the fixings?  We got all fixings. 
[02:01:00]  You got some hot sauce or some hot peppers or whatever?  You ate the whole thing?  No.  You got some pickles?  Yeah, I'll have a bite.  Huh?  You're a pickle guy?  Thanks.  I'm a pickle guy on mine.  Oh, it's hot, too.  And maybe some of those red hot sauce you got.  Dude, this looks like the cheesesteak I eat.  Yeah.  Right here.  Let me skip it out of the way.  Okay.  Are you going to eat one, Jimmy?  I'll have a bite.  I'm not going to eat one.  Yeah, give me some of that shit.  Do you have any ketchup?  Yeah.  Ketchup?  Yeah, what do you put on a fucking cheesesteak?  If they have the red hot pepper sauce.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's pretty fucking good. 
[02:01:30]  Do you have any diet soda?  What?  I like diet soda.  I don't like the regular stuff.  Oh, you guys do like a red hot.  I see.  That's pretty goddamn good.  Fuck yeah.  Can you hop at me?  Oh, my fucking gas is going to roll.  I know.  Jesus.  You guys.  Jimmy Norton.  Amy, what are you doing?  Throw the oatmeal away.  No, I'm not.  I'm going to boxing.  Huh?  Yeah, in a second.  No, let's just eat.  Are you going to boxing?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm boxing, huh?  I'm boxing. 
[02:02:00]  Anybody want some red peppers?  Do you do it for just to keep in shape or for self-defense, too?  No, I like it.  I want to learn how to be a good boxer.  To kick some ass?  Yeah.  Are you like, not afraid, but...  Oh, no, not like for self-defense.  No, not at all?  Not...  No, I don't think I could do anything.  Aren't you afraid of getting hit in the face?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like, if you're boxing, do you spar with people?  Do they punch each other in the head?  Uh, no.  Okay.  So you put gloves on?  It's me and Keith Robinson.  Oh, shit.  And I'm not afraid of him.  Oh, okay.  Well, you should be.  Do you pretend your opponent is the date raper?  Oh. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, I just try to fall asleep so he can fuck me.  You want some pickles, then?  That's the object of the game.  No, I'm not a pickle guy.  What about that?  Sauerkraut?  No.  Sauerkraut?  Roland, stop.  How are these?  Are they good?  It's fucking amazing.  It's really good.  Are you only gonna have one bite, Jimmy?  I'm taking it.  No, a couple bites.  It's fucking...  No, it's up to a couple bites.  That is good stuff.  Wow.  Yeah, man.  This oatmeal's good.  Amy's such a good girl. 
[02:03:00]  I'm being good.  I'm just for the next month.  Yeah?  Because I'm filming my special.  Yeah.  And you want to look good, do you?  Yeah.  I look like shit on camera.  What?  Oh, in San Francisco.  Oh, cool.  What room?  The Fillmore.  Wow.  June 23rd.  Really?  The tickets are available online now.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  They look fabulous.  They look so good.  I don't know what else to do with you guys, but give you a really good plug.  Where's the place again?  99 miles to Philly.  99 miles to Philly.  94 3rd Avenue.  Right.  Between 12th and 13th Street. 
[02:03:30]  Well, I look stupid today, because you could get a really good Philly cheesesteak right  here in Manhattan.  And then come the fall, we're gonna be in Midtown.  We're gonna be delivering to Midtown again.  Really?  Amazing.  Good for you.  We're gonna take a break.  Amy Schumer's at the Stress Factory this weekend.  Mm-hmm.  Come on out.  In New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Yeah, please go see Amy.  And we'll continue.  And Marco Island next weekend.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Have you done that room?  No.  Have you?  Yeah, it's cool.  I'm living my dreams. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  Performing on the ship that fucking Robert Shaw was eaten off of in Jaws.  Have fun with that one.  Thanks, guys.  Your support means the world.  A lot of people are saying I go to 99 miles and it's great.  See?  There you go.  People love it.  Alright, we'll take a quick break.  We'll be back.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Why did we just do that?  I'm really mad.  Such regret. 
[02:04:30]  It could be the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten and I really mean that.  We really didn't mean them for them to come in.  We were just talking about it.  And then also we get the call, hey, we'll come in with cheesesteaks and then you're weak  and you go, alright.  Sure.  I just ate the whole fucking thing, man.  Can we go get vegetable juice?  That ain't gonna help.  It's in ya.  Is it in you?  Oh, it's in me.  It's in you already.  That cheesesteak was amazing.  Fucking amazing.  I had four bites.  Really?  Yeah, and I threw it out.  I can't. 
[02:05:00]  I mean, they were great.  It was fucking great.  I meant to have one bite.  So I had three more bites than I was.  I could have eaten two of those cheesesteaks.  I could have actually eaten those until I was sitting on the bowl shitting as I ate.  Oh, yeah.  That was fucking fantastic.  Oh, that would have been good.  I ate half bitten and I threw the rest out.  I couldn't.  I can't let myself eat a whole one.  You know, I didn't even know what a cheesesteak was until, you know, married the Philly girl  and go down there a lot.  And now I was telling you guys, on my way in or on my way out, I have to get one every fucking time now. 
[02:05:30]  How many calories, Sam, for a full cheesesteak?  That wasn't a massive cheesesteak, though.  Don't.  Let's not do this in front of Amy.  She's going to call us girls and shit.  No, we can't.  For a 10 inch sandwich?  Was that about 10 inches?  That was more than 10 inches?  It's probably 10 inches.  Nah, it looked like a 10 inches.  I can tell you from experience, that's about 10.  Yeah, it's about 10.  And that's, you're looking at about 980 calories.  Okay, so I had about 4 or 6.  Wow.  That's like almost 5 calories.  Jesus.  We are, right? 
[02:06:00]  No, you guys are a sensitive age.  I'm glad you're taking care of yourselves.  Yeah, we are.  We're girls, right?  And you're women.  Didn't help that I put the hot peppers on there and I got like horrendous heartburn  immediately.  I don't even have hot peppers.  Right to the White Watchers point.  Oh, boy.  Now it's gone too far.  This fucking Oprah Watcher.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Just put a comma in that.  Forget about it.  Oh, my God.  The place is called 99 miles to Philly and I don't really know where they're located.  Yeah.  Wow.  On the back of their shirt in the biggest letters possible. 
[02:06:30]  That's right, Dano.  East Village.  No, sir.  94 3rd Avenue.  What's the quote on the bottom?  Meatless diets are often dangerous.  U.S. government.  That's right.  That sounds about right.  Yeah.  Hey, what do we want to eat next?  What do you want to try next from another city?  Oh, what?  Have people bring shit here again?  I know you don't like that deep dish piece of shit.  I don't like that Chicago crap.  Maybe he just hasn't had the right one.  Yeah.  I love when Anthony hates things that are just unreasonable.  It's like, why?  What do we do here? 
[02:07:00]  Like, we'll be listening to a Johnny Cass...  Anthony ruined Rusty Cage for me because I really love it.  And it's like...  It's so fucking great.  And Anthony's like...  I just don't like that.  And now he just ruined it.  That's all you hear, right?  Yeah.  I still love the song, but all I hear is him hating it.  Uh...  How do you not like this?  I don't think...  You don't like this.  Rusty Cage!  Terrible. 
[02:07:30]  It's good, dude.  No.  The real version is good.  This sucks.  That rolling guitar.  I love it.  It's Tom Petty.  Tom Petty.  Tom Petty doesn't...  He's playing this.  Oh, he's playing it for him.  This was Tom Petty's band playing this.  I did not know that, sir.  Yep.  Did not know that.  You're doing the video.  I'm gonna break...  It's a Sauergarten cover.  Yeah.  I'm gonna break my...  This is good.  I'm gonna break my...  Rusty Cage.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh... 
[02:08:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  What's wrong with this, man?  Come on.  I don't like it.  I like the real version of this song.  I like this.  It's a little bit...  It's fucking phenomenal.  I was listening to it on the way into the Dubliners.  Did we listen to them?  No.  I got off on some weird...  The Pogues I like, and now they annoy me.  Um...  Oh, really?  Yeah, I still like...  But they did a couple of songs where Shane McGowan was singing with fucking Ronnie Drew,  who's dead.  Uh...  But they worship him in Ireland.  Like, fucking Bono, all those guys fucking worshipped Ronnie Drew. 
[02:08:30]  Who was Ronnie Drew?  He sang for the Dubliners.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, they did a cover of this fucking Eric Bogle, another Irish guy song.  So let's play it.  Called Now I'm Easy.  The Dubliners.  Why are you listening to all this mixed shit?  I don't know.  It's my whiteness.  I'm getting in touch with being white.  I am.  Yeah, that's kinda good.  Um, but yeah, it's the fucking...  The Dubliners version of, uh, Now I'm Easy.  Let's check it out.  It's just a miserable song about a fucking lonely guy.  I love when other people pick out thorns on this show.  He was good, man.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think he died of cancer. 
[02:09:00]  He was bald in the last thing I saw him in.  Oh, geez.  So I'm assuming he was fucking cancerous.  Is this bald?  Is this it?  I don't know if this is Ronnie Drew.  Ronnie Drew.  Hi.  For nearly 60 years, I've been a queen.  What year is this?  This is not the version, but this is him.  Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through police.  I feel like this is a good time to bring up the suicide pact.  I like this.  This is shit, man.  How do you like this? 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  I like blue collar shit for some reason.  This is blue collar.  This is blue collar.  This is blue collar.  This guy's a fucking farmer, man.  He's got nothing.  His kids are dead.  His wife died.  He's got shit.  A fine girl when I was 20.  A fine girl when I was 20.  You know what happened?  It ain't good.  No.  She stayed in.  Giving birth when she was 30.  God, my God.  She's got 10 good years with her.  No flying.  Look at the bright side. 
[02:10:00]  Look at the bright side.  Just a gentle, long black gin.  That's great.  It's nearly over now.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anthony's going to ruin this too.  There we go.  She left me to the sun.  Oh, wow.  I'm going to toss her.  It's like the music from One Go Over Cuckoo's Nest.  The soil dried out.  For a lot.  Her. 
[02:10:30]  So you hit the kids.  They grow up by your skin.  But it's nearly over now.  And now I may be.  There.  Fuck yeah.  I like this.  It's great.  It's a little, sorry.  Repetitious.  Yeah, but I like stuff like that.  It's a story song, isn't it?  Yeah.  We like story songs. 
[02:11:00]  His kids are buried by the fucking red.  His daughter got married too.  Both of them did.  His daughter was fucking.  His fucking daughter got married and he skipped out.  My daughter left with a negro.  It's the most tragic part of the song.  Or even worse, it was a bridge.  For now.  No, but fucking he said his care was rough and ready,  so he probably fucking smacked the kids around.  So why enough?  Now I'm easy.  What does that mean?  I think he's ready to die.  And now I'm easy.  Wow.  Now it's okay. 
[02:11:30]  He's accepting his fate.  What a depressing ass fucking song.  Yeah, he's alone on his fucking bone dry shitty farm.  The fucking city people don't like these fucking cockies  because they think they're on the dole and getting all this shit.  Maybe they just don't like his music.  Jimmy's just turned into an Irish gentleman.  No.  They don't like these motherfuckers.  It's Irish Jimmy.  A hungry shirt.  And an old black Jen.  That's like some kind of a fucking...  That's like racially inappropriate.  That's like saying a jig.  Really?  Yeah.  It used to be a...  Oh, sorry.  A Jewish...  A Jen.  It's like an old black nurse. 
[02:12:00]  In the fucking...  Oh, Ireland.  And the potato blight came along and took me crops.  My cheeks are red and my dick is small.  Yeah, they're not pirates here.  Right.  And then I decided to drink again because it was a day that ended with day.  Because we're Irish and we're drunk.  Wow.  This is not even his song.  He just covered it.  Now I'm easy.  Thank God.  Now I'm easy.  E-Rock was easy. 
[02:12:30]  No, it's now I'm heavy.  Did E-Rock have a cheesesteak?  It's now I'm eating.  It's now I'm eating.  It's now I'm eating.  He got a couple for himself.  Did E-Rock add a couple cheesesteaks?  Add one and a container of pickles.  I grabbed two cheesesteaks out of the bag.  And I tried shoving them in my ears.  And now I'm easily 300 pounds.  I'm really overweight and now I'm eating.  I'm eating. 
[02:13:00]  It's nearly over now.  Oh, it's nearly over now.  It's great.  Uh-oh.  And now I'm easy.  Never heard that.  That's cool.  Wow.  That's brutal.  That song's brutal.  The same guy that wrote fucking, the band played Waltzing Matilda.  He was fucking, he's a brilliant songwriter, man.  Does he have any happy songs?  What's that?  I'd like a couple of happy songs where people are happy.  The band played Waltzing Matilda.  I know.  I have no idea.  He's all over the back. 
[02:13:30]  Well, I'll start talking like this, eh?  Ooh, yeah.  Hey, how about that?  He's Australian, actually.  Really?  He's Australian, yeah.  And he wrote a great song about fucking, the band played Waltzing Matilda about the  fucking war, when the fucking soldiers all get fucked up and their legs get shot off.  Of course.  Yeah, we did this one.  Yeah, we played this one, yeah.  Why wouldn't it be a nice, happy song?  Well, yeah, it can't be.  You're off to war.  Are all these Irish songs like this, though?  He was Australian.  This is about the Turks and the Irish, and the Australians.  Fine.  Oh.  But, you know, it's a long song.  We don't have to play it. 
[02:14:00]  It's sad.  Another story song.  Where's the joy?  Jimmy loves a good story song.  I really do.  I love a good, miserable story song.  Yeah.  But it's, you know, because the fucking soldiers get all these fucking band music and shit when they  come back.  Yeah.  Everyone's uncomfortable and they're all fucking maimed.  Wow.  That was good.  I just mimed uncomfortable.  Yeah, you did.  You did.  You were acting.  Somebody's looking through the window.  They're not.  He has some acting chops.  They're not.  Yes, sir.  I can do mime.  Speaking of music, Dr. Steve, thank you for the CD.  What did he do? 
[02:14:30]  The Cramps.  Oh.  We talked about The Cramps, remember?  That one song from Mondo Topless or whatever.  Did he send you like antacid to like, as a joke, like along with The Cramps.  Yeah.  I gave you something to relieve The Cramps.  Well.  His doctored humor.  And he makes his own version.  And now I'm Stevie.  You know what he did though?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He sent me.  So I'm going to get out of here.  Yeah.  No shit.  And now she's sleeping.  Dr. Steve sent me a dusty CD though.  It's a little weird. 
[02:15:00]  What do you mean?  It was from his collection, obviously.  He's done with The Cramps.  He didn't buy you a CD?  No.  It's really old.  That's pretty good.  What a crud.  Fucking crud.  Dr. Steve is very generous.  He's very generous.  Yeah, with his old shit.  Oh, he's with his old stuff.  That's great.  He sent me Kiss Destroyer.  What a fucking crud.  Right.  Yeah.  Not generous.  I like Dr. Steve.  That song I like from The Cramps isn't on it.  Oh, shit.  The way you, the way you, could you play that again?  For Amy.  Oh, I'm okay.  I think of Amy when this song is playing. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  I really do.  The Cramps.  It's about a girl that fell asleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The way.  Bleeding.  Yeah, yeah, this one.  The way I walk after her.  This is what I, I think of you, Ramey.  Oh, that means a lot.  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  The Cramps.  The way I walk is just the way I walk.  I like this.  The way I talk is just the way I talk.  The way I smile is just the way I smile. 
[02:16:00]  Just miss baby, baby, and I go home.  I fucking love this dumb song.  Why, why was it this popular?  Because it's this.  How many reasons would you like?  This doesn't have.  Really?  This doesn't have a very popular appeal.  You got a high five to it?  Oh, no, 50s?  The weirdo.  I can see the weirdo kids listening to this in school.  Yeah.  This is the song I'm on right now.  The weirdo kids.  Oh, Amy's going to turn this on to one.  I can't stop listening to this song.  It really makes sense. 
[02:16:30]  Put it on the speaker so we can all hear it.  Oh, you know, she wants to surprise us.  I'm stupid looking up.  No, no.  It's just, I can't, I don't know how to say it.  I really don't.  Oh, my God.  You type like an elderly woman.  This is kind of very unpleasant.  It looks like you just got your first typewriter.  An unpleasant tweet.  It said, I saw terror from the movie The Wanderers last night, but it was only Bob Kelly.  Oh.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, terror.  Oh, that's fucking great. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Join the Marines.  Yeah.  Was that a fucking gross burger from Stair Crazy or no?  I think it was.  Oh, I think it was.  Yes.  I think you're right.  Yes.  What song is Amy listening to?  And Now I'm Easy.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's what it is.  Now I'm Easy.  Did we already listen to it?  How about Dirty Old Town?  Are you looking that up?  That's another good one.  Oh, man.  Loves that chick.  Want to come up if you just put that in?  Yeah, right?  It's just like random writers.  Sam stinks at fucking helping. 
[02:17:30]  Is it real?  Oh, Sam.  How is that a song?  I don't know.  Why is it that long?  It's not there?  It's long.  Why?  Will it work if I just play it on my iPhone?  Probably will.  It couldn't work worse.  Oh, it's like the Heineken commercial.  Do you know this one?  No.  Oh, yeah.  What is this?  I don't know, but it's the same genre as the Heineken commercial. 
[02:18:00]  Actually, I saw the IED go off to the song.  Oh, my God.  What is it?  What is that?  I don't know how to say it.  Is it engine music?  Is it engine?  It is some sort of an engine.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a rock.  I feel like I'm in a camp.  Bollywood stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, Hollywood.  I forgot you hate all browns.  Ah, yeah.  Why do their song titles have to be so long?  I don't know.  I just watched that movie The Party with Peter Sellers.  We're playing an Indian guy. 
[02:18:30]  I didn't see it.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  He's playing an Indian dude.  It's like unbelievable.  Is it racist?  It's so racist.  Yeah, it's great.  It's funny.  Look at old days.  It's long and experimental, but there were some moments.  He was great in being there.  It was just like he's wearing brown face and talking like an Indian dude.  You can't get away with that man.  He was a funny dude, Peter Sellers, man.  He was a really funny dude.  But then again, he played a Frenchman in Pink Panthers.  Yeah, but you could do that.  No, it's racist.  It's white people playing other white people. 
[02:19:00]  Played basically an autistic in being there.  Is that him right there?  Andy Gardner.  Yeah, that's him.  Sam, can we watch it?  It's long.  It's just experimental and crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He literally does this for eight minutes.  Oh, my God.  He dies for eight minutes.  I can't stand movies like this.  Boy, I hate a lot of things. 
[02:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  I do.  Except what you should hate, which is drinking.  Oh, no.  That's good.  That makes me love for a short time.  All right.  What's he...  He does nothing.  All right.  Listen, it is experimental.  Oh, God.  Did he take that?  It's a good way to not drink.  I'm trying to not drink for a month.  Oh, man.  I didn't drink for a week when I was sick.  I cough.  So just catch, like, a severe illness?  Yeah, yeah.  Get like that.  Get food poisoning or something again.  I just have that, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Why don't you want to drink?  You want to keep your...  For the special, I just want to get it together.  I want to look together.  And I want to be excited to drink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you can go for a while and you make a drink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So why don't you...  For a month and then you won't.  How bad is drinking?  Every day?  Really?  For a month.  All right.  No.  I mean, I don't drink all that much, but a couple of glasses of vodka.  Yeah.  Or giant glasses.  Yeah, just some wine.  Huge tumblers.  A little tequila.  I don't have a problem.  A little tequila.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  A little Ambien. 
[02:20:30]  Not a huge deal.  Yeah.  A couple of Xanax.  Just throw it in the mix.  Try to keep myself balanced.  Get it all together.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, it balances you out.  Stress factory this weekend, Amy Schumer.  Are you the funny comedian?  Are you the funny comedian?  Yeah, I gotta go box.  Right now?  Yeah.  Who's boxing?  Keith and who else?  Uh, and my friend Kevin today.  Do they...  Are they rough with you?  Do they...  No, they can't.  I'm...  I do better than them in there.  Yeah?  Yeah, honestly.  But you know, Keith's tall talk.  He has no, like... 
[02:21:00]  He can't breathe because he's talking so much shit.  And he can't back it up at all.  Keith is probably a really good street fighter.  Like, he's a Philly, thick-headed idiot.  But Keith is a tough dude.  He can't jump rope.  No, of course he can't.  He literally can't.  Really?  He takes hand-eye coordination.  Keith is a dummy.  I thought they were good at that.  Yeah, I thought there was like a rhythm to it.  You just remind me of something.  Could you tell that Keith Robinson story from the book or no?  I just started...  I have an advanced copy of Cheat, which was written by Bill and Byrne DeRosa and Bob Kelly. 
[02:21:30]  And it's very good.  I just got through the first 20 pages on the plane.  I have a story in there, by the way.  You do.  I still do.  And Opie does as well.  We all have stories in there.  Cheating.  But I got through the Keith Robinson story about getting caught cheating.  And it's...  I don't want to blow the whole thing, but I'll say this.  It's a very...  It'll sell books for Bobby.  It's a very funny story about how Keith was fucking going out to cheat with this girl.  And he told the girl he was with that he's going out to play some basketball with some 
[02:22:00]  friends.  But she's like, why are you so dressed up?  Because he had like silk pants on.  And he's like, well, we get to go out to dinner first.  Or whatever he said.  So she fucking hops in the car and she follows him running red lights.  And he's on the phone with Kevin Hart going, come out of the house but hold a basketball.  Come out of the house and you're holding a basketball.  When you're trying to get your alibi together on the phone while your bitch is chasing you,  that's not good.  But it's funny because they give you the story like that and then they break down where  you fucked up. 
[02:22:30]  So that's the only cheat story I've read.  And there is a fuck up.  And they break down how he did fuck up.  It's very funny.  I can't wait to read how I fucked up.  The punchline of that story is hilarious.  It's great.  I think I know how I fucked up in my story.  Having two girls at the house at the same time.  I've had very...  Oh, you have a great cheat story.  Oh, it's horrible.  I've had very, very few getting caught cheat stories.  Really?  Almost no.  You're good like that.  Well, Jimmy's good like that.  You mean in the act or at all?  In the act, never, but...  Just like them knowing that you are cheating. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  There's been times where I haven't too, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy's pretty good.  When he's told me stories in the past, I've been like, wow, I fucked that up.  Like, I was the guy that never had a fucking security code on my phone, and I'd come home  to just a crying girl.  Oh.  He throws the phone at me.  I'm like, oh, this can't be...  All you want to do is leave?  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just like, how do I get out of this?  Yes.  I got caught not cheating, but like planning to cheat, and I was so high, and it was like 
[02:23:30]  my apartment.  I got out of the...  Is that the email thing?  Yeah.  I remember when that was happening.  We were in the car, and she was telling me, it's bad.  It was so bad.  Oh, man.  My boyfriend at the time read my email, and he would always like...  Yeah, he would like...  As soon as I would leave the room, he would check my email.  I didn't know how to set up a...  You know?  It sucks.  And I came in, and the way he looked at me, I was just like, fuck.  Yeah, that look.  Ooh.  And I was smiling.  When I'm uncomfortable, I just smile, and I'm just smiling at him, and he's like, is 
[02:24:00]  there something you want to tell me?  He was doing the, like, I haven't...  And you're like, well, what do you know?  You don't want to give it to me.  This is totally backwards.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to figure out what he knows, and he's like, ugh.  And I was like, can you leave?  I was like, oh, sorry.  Can you leave?  Can you leave?  I was like, can you please leave?  Oh, that's brilliant.  And he laughed like an angel.  I was like, ugh.  Wow.  He's like, I'm going to leave.  I was like, yeah.  Follow that impulse.  Yeah, could you do that?  Let's go.  Follow that impulse.  You don't want to deal with it.  Not when you're high. 
[02:24:30]  Not when you're high.  It was so much worse.  I was just like, ugh.  You're just surprised with it.  Is this happening?  Yeah.  I hate that.  It's awful.  That was bad.  That's a great idea, though.  I got a call one time on the way to the cellar, and this is what I hear from my girlfriend  at the time.  How long have you been cheating on me?  Oh.  That's a loaded question.  Shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, what happened was a rookie mistake.  I left my laptop open, but it was with a dirty, it was a dirty IM, but it was a girl 
[02:25:00]  that I wasn't fucking.  It was a girl I was fucking years ago.  It doesn't fucking matter.  It doesn't matter.  Only talking dirty.  I've been fucked over for DMs and shit.  DMs.  You're right.  I've been fucked over for DMs and texts and emails that have been looked at, you know?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, why the fuck did I leave that open?  Yeah.  I got that, and I named the checks.  I saved it to jerk off to.  Oh, boy.  And it was a dirty one.  What'd you name it?  Um, let's say her name was Lori. 
[02:25:30]  I named it Lori Gets It.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you hack.  I know.  But that was a good, dirty talk.  Yeah.  But luckily, it really wasn't.  It was emotionally cheating.  Like a serial killer that saves the necklace.  Yeah, but I-  He wants his little fucking trophies.  Oh, God.  That got me burned another time, too.  But with the same girl.  But they were both times, they were not people I was fucking at all.  This girl I hadn't seen in years, and I really didn't want to see again.  But it was just fun to talk.  The dirty talk stuff. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, no.  I've tried that, too.  Where it's like, I hadn't been fucking.  I hadn't been.  But I maybe, you know, threw some fucking texts out there.  Some drunken night of, hey, I'd like to do this, that, the other thing.  And then, you know, I leave something open, dumb.  Yeah.  It gets seen, and it's like, and then you try to explain, no, I'm not fucking.  I'm just fucking, fucking around.  Yeah.  I don't even know what, like, what the real problem is.  Because it's not, like, if I've been worried a guy cheated on me, it's not like, oh, me  picturing him, his hands on someone else. 
[02:26:30]  That doesn't, it's the ego.  Ah.  I think, you know, I don't think it's really, like, the thought of him being with somebody  else.  It's something else.  That doesn't bother you.  I don't think that's what it is that bothers.  It's like, how could you fucking do this when I'm here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That kind of a thing.  It's that kind of thing, I think.  Yeah.  It's, uh.  Or another girl thinking that she can, like, take your.  Oh, take your shit.  Shit.  I think that's the thing too.  I don't think the other chick's thinking that.  Really?  I don't think so.  Well, what would bother you about a girl cheating on you?  Like what? 
[02:27:00]  That she's not out of the fucking house fast enough afterwards.  Just get the fuck out.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My whole fucking attitude has changed in the past, I'd say five years or so.  Ever since my last relationship, I was going out with Melinda for probably eight years.  And every relationship I had was pretty fucking long term and monogamous.  Mm-hmm.  And then after that one, I just had this change of fucking thought like, what am I crazy?  Fuck this. 
[02:27:30]  Because they all end up being batshit crazy anyway.  And then fucking, you know, I'm not gonna, I'm not getting attached to somebody the second  I have sex with them.  That's it.  It's not happening anymore.  And I'm not going fucking ballistic thinking about the girl having sex with someone else.  Like that used to bug the shit out of me.  I would stay with girls, not break up with them because I didn't want to even think of  them being with someone else.  We all did that.  What is that?  Now, it's you get the fuck out, suck a dick, I don't even care anymore. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  It's a weird possessive, you're afraid of, you're going to let them go and then want them  and not be able to have them.  I, a friend of mine went through this recently.  He had a big breakup with a girl.  Oh, a friend.  He wants back.  And now.  Just call this band Jimmy Norton.  But he broke up with this girl, it was on and off, on and off, and then she wound up  being with somebody for real and having a baby.  Oh boy.  So, and he said something very interesting to me.  He said, his therapist said to him, uh, you still think you can change it, but you 
[02:28:30]  can't.  Wow.  And that was a really harsh.  This isn't you?  No, I would tell you.  Of course, don't tell me.  No.  It's Mitch Kumstein.  Mitch Kumstein.  You still think you can change it, but you can't.  And that's a really powerful thing.  Like, and I've been thinking about that with, cause me and my ex are still friends.  Um, I don't know if we'll ever get back together, but it's like, we don't fuck because it's  like, it's just too much, man.  I don't want a chance.  Like, I don't know how I'm going to feel when she hooks up with somebody else. 
[02:29:00]  Uh huh.  I may be devastated.  Oh, you know how you'll feel.  You'll be bummed out.  I will be very bummed out.  Extremely bummed out.  But I know my ex before her dates other people and is dated and I could care less.  I've thought about it this way though, recently, like in the, in the old days, if the girl  I was going out with starts going out with somebody else, I would be fucking psychopathic.  Yeah.  Crazy.  All I could think about.  And then after a few months go by, it just goes away and you don't care anymore.  So now I'm thinking like, or a few years ago I started thinking like, look, why don't 
[02:29:30]  I just go to that point now and realize that no matter how crazy, insane, jealous I am  right now, in a few months I'm not going to give a shit.  So why not just not give a shit now?  But can you do that?  Yes.  Really?  You absolutely can.  Because I absolutely got to the point where I used to obsess about that shit.  Fucking obsess about it.  Who is she?  Who is she?  Let me check the message boards.  Let me check this.  Who is she fucking...  Now it's just, I don't fucking... 
[02:30:00]  Send me pictures.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  I don't care.  I don't fucking care.  I'm so bitter these days.  No, it's not bitter though.  Here's the thing.  If you're a woman, and you have a guy that's much older than you, and we're paying your  bills, I understand you don't want to fuck other people.  I get that.  But if we're talking dirty a little bit, let us do it.  Right.  That's all it is.  It's all we need.  We're paying for everything.  No, I want to be the one that you're talking dirty to.  You will be.  No, but that too?  The girl will be the one, but we need to not feel trapped. 
[02:30:30]  What?  You don't want that.  I want...  You don't want a guy chatting dirty.  Yeah, no.  I want to be...  I would want that guy just...  I could see how you don't want it.  But don't look for it.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I don't look for it.  Don't look for our texts.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want it.  Fair enough.  You know, you have that early, like...  Yeah, the jealous relationship where it's just so toxic.  Oh, yeah.  I don't do that anymore.  No?  I'm not searching.  I'm not...  Yeah, no.  I want to feel good, and I don't want to know.  Even, like, when I was dating a comic, I was like, if you cheat on me on the road,  please don't let me find out. 
[02:31:00]  Like, that's it.  And I will not do the leg work.  I won't be, like, befriending a waitress the weekend before you're there.  Like, hey!  Leg work!  Will you...  You sent it in advance team.  No.  That means she's done that.  No, I've never done that.  I've never done that.  That's great, though.  I've never done that.  Befriend a waitress.  Yeah.  It's just like, yeah, the thought of, like, if I wanted to, I could find out.  I'm not...  I don't want to know.  Yeah, yeah.  I really don't want to know.  There are some girls that just really dive in headfirst every fucking inch of your private 
[02:31:30]  life is open.  I don't want to know.  I don't think that...  Because I don't think the actual fucking matters.  Like, I think, especially guys, I really believe you can, like, be totally in love with  someone and fuck someone else.  But I think dirty texting and the fantasizing about somebody else and communicating with  them, that seems, like, way, way worse to me.  Huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, you know, you're right.  That's how you feel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how I feel.  I'm a sex addict.  I can't help it. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, see?  What am I going to do?  I don't think you're an asshole.  I just...  I wouldn't...  I'd be hurt by that.  You're alone in this room.  I don't think there's a lot of girls that would accept what these guys are saying.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a lot of women out there that would accept that.  Oh, I know.  Dude, absolutely.  They're just talking.  They're just talking.  They get pissed if you fucking jerk off to a dumb picture on the internet, even.  I don't care about that.  It's a meat spinner.  I used to.  11 parties.  11 parties.  But you used to get pissed off at that?  Yeah, I used to be...  I used to, like...  When I was, like, 21, I thought porn was, like, cheating.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but then I... 
[02:32:30]  No, that's fine.  I grew up.  That's my line.  That's no big deal.  Yeah.  No, I grew up now.  Girls are different these days, too.  Yeah, I didn't like porn, and now I have a problem.  Girls love porn now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how it is.  We gotta get Amy out of here.  She's late now.  Thank you guys so much for having me.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Yes.  I'm telling you, if you don't have plans this weekend, go see Amy at the Stress Factory.  Amy's very funny.  Thank you.  Fucking hilarious.  And Amy Schumer on Twitter, M-C-H-U-M-E-R.  That's so nice.  They love her here. 
[02:33:00]  As a matter of fact, I'll just pick random.  Tostito is saying, I'd fuck Amy's funny mouth.  Aww.  Aww.  Tostito?  Now, is that funny stuff that comes out of your mouth, or do you think her quirky,  cute smile is funny?  Yeah.  Well, let's ask Tostito.  Tostito?  Are you there?  Tostito?  Yeah, what's he in, dip or something?  She's wonderful.  That's what Tostito says.  Tostito.  No guns on that one.  I don't know.  Thanks, you guys.  Oh, my God.  Tostito, hold out for Frito, honey.  You'll do a whole lot better. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Character to me.  Tostito.  Now go work off all this sexual tension you got built up.  That's it.  I'm gonna work off your cheesesteaks.  Wow.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Morgan Spurlock next.  Thanks to Amy Schumer.  Right here.  Valley Gym.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  The kids are running wild because school's out but cools in.  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  California is trendsetting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley. 
[02:34:30]  And in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops.  Turn it up.  Middle finger time.  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh, my God.  You're so old, you should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  Hello.  Well, whatever.  You're, uh, grody.  Yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym. 
[02:35:00]  Coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  Sirius X.  It's the O.P. Anthony Show.  Ah, that's fucking funny, man.  Uh, there's a boxing video out there.  God, that guy's funny.  A few people tweeted me, uh, last night, and I appreciate that.  It's a guy, uh, weak men pay this boxing coach to tell them they are terrible. 
[02:35:30]  And by the way, he will have a reality show.  Oh, yeah.  He's good.  He's very good.  He was, uh, uh, a really good boxer.  And then he had some kind of street altercation that took him out of the game.  Put a pull cue across his eye.  Yeah, he's kind of got a lazy left eye.  I guess all the muscles are weak.  And he said something's floating in there.  Is it his eyeball?  I think so.  Something like that.  And he's got a weak eyelid.  And now he, uh, he's a boxing trainer down there on, uh, what is it called?  Church?  Church Street.  Church Street. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  We filmed something there once.  Oh, right.  No one ever saw it.  It was part of our dumb pilot that never saw the light of day.  That was the, we went down there with Keith Robinson and Voss and all them.  And, uh, yeah, anyway, he, he trains down there and the guy just fucking beats the shit  out of people verbally.  He makes fun of the nerdy Wall Street people that go down there and say that they're boxing.  Right.  You know, yeah, I go to the gym, I box.  Yeah.  And, uh, he just pretty much exposes them for the frauds they are.  But you know, they're not supposed to be good fighters.  No, but he's like, he's the, from the mindset that if you're at the gym and you're putting 
[02:36:30]  gloves on and boxing, you should be good.  Cause he said he don't go down to Wall Street and grab a briefcase and try to go down there  and start typing.  Right.  You want to play a little of this on the air?  It's a little slow.  It's a little long.  Uh, so I don't know if it really works for a radio show.  You want to start from the beginning?  Yeah.  Let's try.  If it, if it's not working, we can bail.  Where's Morgan, by the way?  He's on his way.  Right now? 
[02:37:00]  I mean, he's not.  Is he on his way as far as Roland goes or is he on his way?  I do not believe he is in the building.  No.  I'm not, I'm not staying late today.  There's no fucking way.  What if he's compelling?  I don't give a fuck.  We've talked to him a million times.  We like him and all, but I'm not sticking around.  Y'all, I mean, that's really.  Oh God.  Right.  You shouldn't have done that.  Yeah, probably shouldn't have.  Uh, here we go.  Let's play a little of this.  Y'all.  We minding my business and leave me yours alone.  We talking about me.  Your job is hold the camera, motherfucker. 
[02:37:30]  That's a curb you're already yelling.  I'm Henry Kelly.  I'm Henry Kelly.  Born to Titusville for the race in Brooklyn, New York.  Fuck out, but where?  Four-time national amateur boxing champ.  That's a hook we cut.  Two-time New York City Golden Glove champion.  I can't believe you're still on this side of the dirt.  I really can't.  2000 Olympic team alternate.  Where you get the old ass Top Gun haircut from?  Two-time ranked number one in the USA.  Why you poking your ass out like that?  You don't want somebody to get behind you? 
[02:38:00]  Also ranked number four in the world.  As long as you've been coming here,  you don't know how to slip and go to the body?  Dumb motherfucker.  I had a pretty successful amateur career.  Eric Kelly, clearly the hungrier fighter.  However, I got injured in a street altercation,  left eye, got hip, pull stick, and whatnot.  So that gave me a floater,  and the nerves and the muscles in my eyelid were very weak.  However, I'm still doing something I love.  Boxing, training people. 
[02:38:30]  Even though I'm training a bunch of fucking nerds,  Wall Street guys, no coordination.  They're just not athletic people.  They got me here.  Look at this motherfucker right here on the back.  Look, look.  Look at this motherfucker right here on the back.  Look, look at the uppercut.  Look at the uppercut.  Look at the uppercut.  Look at the uppercut.  Look at the uppercut like this.  Hey, hey.  Do your uppercut again.  Do your uppercut again.  Do your uppercut again.  You're good or not?  Terrible.  Like the worst thing in the world.  Jesus, double jab, right uppercut, left foot right here. 
[02:39:00]  Double jab, right uppercut, left foot right here.  All these white guys.  A lot of these cats, I wish they'd just forget the address to the gym.  You know, everything is not for everybody.  You don't see me going to motherfucking Wall Street,  picking up a fucking briefcase trying to type, do you?  That's not what the fuck I do.  I beat the fuck out of people.  You know what I mean?  Now you got these pieces of shit want to come here and feel like men at the end of the day.  Cause, oh, I did something.  I put, I punched the buzz. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, you was a fucking wuss.  You know, and you couldn't last a day in my shoes.  Why you got this shit all up?  How the fuck you going to boil your fist?  You got this shit all up doing your fucking knuckles, you dumb shit.  You got the knuckles, but you don't come all up to smell all the vickers.  He's taking his hand up, he's fucking it up.  You look like all the nerds just had a convention on your body.  Like all the nerds of the world that say, you know what?  I know where to go.  And they chose your punk ass.  Motherfuckers beat you up as a kid and they still do today.  You're a grown ass man. 
[02:40:00]  I bet you got, I bet somebody get you a wedgie on your way here.  I bet you fart, thread come out.  Like I said, it's just not built for it.  Everything ain't for everybody.  See, they cut from different clothes.  Some people is cut from leather.  Like you take a person of my caliber.  I don't cut from leather.  I don't cut from suede.  You know what I mean?  I ride the bullet.  That's what I do.  Woo!  Baudela!  What's going on, Baudela?  Baudela! 
[02:40:30]  Baudela!  Look at him up over here.  I'm up over here about five different colors.  Count the different colors in his hair.  That's like every earth tone in the color matrix.  Hell got your color!  Let's go, baby!  Where you getting them young ass shorts from?  It's like 1972 NBA Eastern Conference final shorts.  It's a job, you know what I mean? And especially in America, you're having a job is a blessing. 
[02:41:00]  And doing something you love is a blessing, even if the people are miscreants.  But, you know, that's how it goes. I mean, I've got a few people that I love, and the staff is great.  I couldn't ask for a better staff. If I couldn't ask for a better job, they make this work well.  It's just that some, majority, most, practically all these motherfuckers here suck.  They love a reality show. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Guaranteed.  Morgan's on his way up.  No, he's not on his way up.  Yeah, I want to say hi to everybody I met yesterday at F6 Labs.  I went to a shooting range yesterday.  It was really great.  My buddy Andy from Coliseum Guns took me down there.  And it's fucking great.  It's a video screen that you shoot live ammo at.  It's fantastic to stand there and blast away at video images of Middle Eastern terrorist Arabs. 
[02:42:00]  And they pull guns on you.  Don't you break the screen?  Nah, it's fucking cool as shit.  It's a horizontal and a vertical huge rolls of paper behind the screen.  Actually, in front of the screen.  And then all you got to do is move the paper a little bit and it covers up all the holes you just made.  And then the sensors pick up the light from when you make a hole.  And the computer puts it all together with the video.  Knows exactly where you shot.  Puts a little mark by the hole you shot. 
[02:42:30]  You got a moving target.  Stationary targets.  It's the coolest fucking thing.  And you're not standing in a little alleyway like the range.  It's a giant fucking room.  I was there with Mark the Animal Mendoza from Twisted Sister.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark the Animal Mendoza.  Is he cool?  Yeah, he loves shooting.  God.  Do you know who you were?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Long Island guy?  Yep.  Another Long Island guy.  Long Island guy.  That loves guns.  Guns! 
[02:43:00]  It was a lot of fun.  And they're really cool.  They do like good drills down there.  They get you into good habits.  And they got trainers down there that really teach you something.  They're like combat guys that know their shit.  Do they do kids parties?  No kids parties.  Fuck!  A lot of guns.  I did notice a very nice poker table in the back.  So I think they do that whole thing.  It's kind of a private club thing that's going on there.  Nice.  But what a facility.  It was great.  Not all smoke.  The place doesn't get full of smoke from the guns and stuff. 
[02:43:30]  It's ventilated.  It's like a perfect...  What's he here?  Where's he going?  He's on his way.  Yeah, it's just a great range.  Much better than just shooting stationary targets.  I'm kind of hooked now going to this place.  I'm going to go there tonight again.  A lot of fun now.  God, that doesn't sound fun.  And I clean my guns like a good boy when you're done.  You don't clean your guns after the range.  You're a fucking idiot.  Really?  What are you going to do?  Put that thing in your holster and hope for the best?  What?  Gunk gets on there?  Hope it just works?  Have a fun deal or something.  Morgan Spurlock. 
[02:44:00]  Morgan, hi sir.  What's up, Morgan?  How are you?  Good.  There he is.  How are you?  Morgan Spurlock.  How are you, man?  How are you guys doing?  Good, good.  Good, man.  Morgan's got a new project.  A new motion picture.  Manson.  Well, you have two, right?  Yeah, Comic-Con opened about eight weeks ago.  Wow, two movies.  And now Manson.  Yeah.  Now, what is it?  Comic-Con was done last fall and then the distributor just held it until the spring.  Oh, really?  Which makes it problematic when you've got another movie that you're finishing.  Right. 
[02:44:30]  But it's all good.  No shit.  What's Manson about?  Manson looks at this crazy, ridiculous world of manscaping that is overcoming manhood today.  So we did this film with Will Arnett and Jason Bateman just to look at kind of the ridiculous side that is male grooming.  Is it a film or a documentary?  It's a documentary.  Oh, it is.  When does it become ridiculous?  Like I shave my balls.  Are they that unruly?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Well, good. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, it worked out a lot.  So it's sweaty, fucking hairy balls.  Well, then you should get a product that we feature.  There's a new product in the film called Fresh Balls.  Oh, we've heard about that.  We've done Fresh Balls.  It would be very beneficial to you then.  Which one is the Fresh Balls again?  It keeps them from stinking.  Yeah.  Also, if it trim down the hair, it keeps it from stinking.  Yeah.  Also, it gets rid of the bat wings.  You know, which is when your scrotum sticks to the inside of your thighs.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It'll take care of that.  Remember that blue powder they were trying to sell us for a while?  Really?  What the fuck was it? 
[02:45:30]  Lie?  It was like...  It was like...  It was...  It was...  Oh, maybe you weren't supposed to put it on your balls.  Gold bomb, man.  It was the gold bomb, but it was in a blue fucking container.  Yeah.  And it's a little tingly.  A little heat.  It has a little kick to it.  A little heat.  Yeah.  I don't want anything tingly going on down there.  Put it on my balls.  Until I want tingly, I don't want tingly.  Right.  Exactly.  I was drunk and I had on army pants.  And I was drinking back then and my balls were fucking sweaty.  And this girl, Karen, used to blow me. 
[02:46:00]  So we're on her fucking patio.  And she goes to...  She leans over to blow me.  Oh, that's funny.  And she...  I had like...  I put powder on my balls to stop them from sweating.  Yeah.  But they reeked.  And she fucking...  No.  She blows me for a minute and she goes...  Stop blowing me.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  They were terrible.  I would assume there's a lot of guys at least shaving their balls.  But where is it too far?  Like the fucking eyebrow thing?  I think there's all kinds of products, you know, that are coming out now where it's 
[02:46:30]  almost like the men have been overcome by this idea, you know, much like women have  for years.  Like there's Manx.  Now there's like Spanx for guys.  Yeah.  There's Mantyhose where guys, I guess, who want to be like Hooters waitresses can like  get...  A flat belly.  Male pantyhose.  A flat tummy.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For me, I feel like it's a, there is a place where you should stop.  Yeah.  That's what I'm asking.  Where is that?  I think Mantyhose is a good place.  Manx is a good place to stop.  I think if you are, if like, if you, if you're one of those guys that you take off 
[02:47:00]  your shirt, like I don't take off my shirt and have like, you know, a sweater underneath,  but there are guys that, uh, that do.  So you may want to tame that shit down.  I trim that down a little bit too.  Yeah.  Guys should take care of that.  This is stuff that was never done.  Yeah.  Well, like if girls don't, yeah.  Cause like, uh, although I did, there was a girl that, uh, I went out with my school that  went out with my school, did have hair on her nipples, which was a very disgusting,  that, that is unruly.  Unruly.  Big turn on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, the eyebrow guys.  I don't get that.  Well, the guys, especially the eyebrows, the one big eyebrow and they don't want to 
[02:47:30]  like get rid of that little middle part.  So you know that there's actually two eyebrows when they're like fucking landscaping.  Oh no.  Well, there's a guy in the film who, uh, one of the guys that we follow who from the  minute he wakes up to when he leaves the house, it's over two hours.  That's like, it's two hours of getting ready.  Holy shit.  He's OCD probably.  Well, it's, he's something cause he's, uh, he, and he, and he does the same thing.  Like Ricky, Ricky really trims down his eyebrows.  Yeah.  Is he gay or straight?  He's a straight guy.  Two hours every day though.  Two hours every day.  Two hours.  There's something going on there.  He shaves his face to like with two different razors. 
[02:48:00]  So he gets two different shades of like five o'clock shadow.  That's kind of crazy.  It's ridiculous.  Maybe if I got something really important, I'll take maybe an hour.  Yeah.  Let's start it.  But that's gotta be.  But every day it's a half hour.  Maybe that's the whole thing.  The, the end of the whole thing.  Like, if you remember years ago, guys didn't give a shit.  I mean, when you watch movies and saw, nobody cared Charlton Heston on the screen.  Uh, that wasn't a guy, you know, John, John Wayne showed up today.  Out of shape, in shape guy.  Out of shape, in shape guy.  John Wayne would slap someone in the face.  Right. 
[02:48:30]  If he showed up.  John Wayne, all those old stars when they take their shirt off Sean Connery, they would just  be disasters.  That's right.  And now it's gotten to the point, do you think it is, it does have something to do  with the movies?  I think the media is a huge, uh, is a huge source of this influence.  You know, the, the way that we want guys to look on television.  We want them to look in movies.  If you look, walk through, walk by a magazine rack.  This is an amazing thing where there used to be the cosmos and the women's day.  And they were like, and they're like, you, you should look better.  You should take care of your man.  Take care of your body.  Yeah.  Bitches. 
[02:49:00]  The men's health magazines.  And it's like, you're too fat.  Lose weight.  Right.  You're not good enough.  Now all the same types of marketing tactics that were going towards women are going towards  men.  Yeah.  They've exposed the women to how men can look and they fucked us all up.  That's right.  Cause now, and, and they realized that there's a huge business in it.  Cause now there's a huge commodification of kind of this idea of quote unquote manliness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Creams and stuff.  Creams and lotions and crap.  Yeah.  You look back years ago.  I mean, boy, my pops would have smacked me.  That's right. 
[02:49:30]  I got to go to the store and pick up some face cream.  Wow.  I got your face cream in the inside of my belt.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You got a face soap or you use your regular soap?  Regular soap.  I use shampoo on my, I like when I wash my hair, I wash my face with shampoo.  Really?  Yeah.  I use a bar of soap.  I use face lotion after though.  I use Dr. Hauschka.  It's a little bit of.  She used Dr. Mengele. 
[02:50:00]  Where Dr. Apartment go.  Shut up.  But Dr. Hauschka, I think it's called.  It's German.  It's very good.  What does it do?  It's smooth.  Yeah.  It's very organic.  Look at how fresh and clean his skin is.  He really does.  Yeah.  We want to make fun of it.  He's like a handsome, he's got the skin of an 11 year old over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what is it?  Is it just the body or is it clothes and everything that you go into?  We go into the clothes a little bit.  Like we talked to a couple of fashion guys, but it's mostly about how guys try to just,  you know, whatever they're trying to do, just present this facade. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  They got their shit together.  Did you, you must've seen then American Psycho, his amazing Patrick Bateman, right?  Yeah.  His whole ritual at the beginning of the day.  Yeah.  It's so good.  He started it.  If you think about it.  Yeah.  Before that, that was a weird, I use an exfoliating wash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just goes through this hole.  That movie might've started it.  Arduous.  Yeah.  That film.  And then there was a, the date, like Axe body spray was this crazy game changer.  Right.  Like suddenly people were like, oh, I should buy this spray. 
[02:51:00]  It's basically, it's cologne, you know, that's like, but it's body spray.  Put on your body spray to like smell good for the day.  And, and they, they use this reverent advertising where you sprayed it on and suddenly like a  million women wanted to attack you.  Yes.  And it sold through the roof.  And then suddenly everybody started making these products that were geared towards young  men.  It was nuts.  Man.  Yeah.  And, uh, razors, I guess, are a big thing too.  I've seen.  Now with 75 blades.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Many different types of blades to get that very, like one hair with beard going.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  And, uh, you know, the, or the, the hipster mutton chop sideburns.  Well, that's the, that'll be the future.  The future will be, everybody will be shaving around like a crazy Wes Bentley beard from like  hunger games.  Like that crazy shitty crazy design on his face designs.  Yeah.  It looks like work.  It looks like men.  I don't think men are cut out to do that because you got to get up early for work.  You're working a long time and this is your average guy.  Yeah.  Like who has time to not just, you know, wash your face, throw a shirt on and leave the house.  And get out.  And get out. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  And don't forget your fellow workers.  You look like a faggot.  Oh, of course.  They would be throwing that word around.  Yeah.  How can you deal with that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because most guys, uh, you know, don't quite do that.  Now you look down.  Are you, are people looked down upon when we, if they're not really?  Well, I think that there's, there's become such a, such this norm.  And we have created this weird social norm that you're expected to look a certain way.  You're supposed to, you know, you're supposed to present yourself a certain way.  The minute you don't, you're a slob, you're a slacker, you're lazy, but you're not successful.  But the blue collar worker is the guy that just kind of goes out, not worrying about his 
[02:52:30]  appearance, but he is the guy that's kind of, you know, working for a living and, and  Yeah.  The normal guy.  Putting in the hours.  You know, this movie, uh, it's a, you know, you're promoting Manson, obviously you didn't  tell me all these cameos.  Yeah.  There's amazing folks in it.  Zach Galifianakis, Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd, John Waters, ZZ Top.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, those guys, their whole life's hinged on that beard.  Right.  Yeah.  The beard's a huge.  Yeah.  And it's going to be on Showtime.  Oh no. 
[02:53:00]  Showtime's in theaters.  Yeah.  It opens today.  It's in 18 markets all across the country today.  Manson, the movie.com.  I got a copy.  I shared my fucking pubes.  I'm, I'm not a hairy guy at all though.  I don't need to shave.  No.  I keep a little down.  Yeah.  One time I was like, you know what?  Actually, I got to see what this is all about.  So it's like, yeah.  So girl said, she goes, you should shave it.  She goes, you'll like it.  I shaved it all off.  And like for a day it's fine, you know, but then it starts growing back in and it's  the most uncomfortable thing I could have ever, I could have ever imagined.  Yeah.  Hated it.  And I was like, I was like, I don't, I don't got like a jungle down there. 
[02:53:30]  I'm all right.  I, you know, I shaved all of it once.  I looked fucking stupid, but I don't know how you do that to me.  I'm not a hairy guy though.  So I just shave it.  I just looked like an idiot.  But your schlong looked gigantic.  Oh yeah.  It was huge.  I looked lonely.  It kind of looked lonely.  It's that one forest left in the Amazon.  There's the one tree, the one tree left standing in the Amazon.  It is.  When you're walking, you're getting fucking pinpricked from the hairs growing in.  I keep shaving every day.  That hurt.  Why?  You have to shave it every day?  How could you fucking find time to shave your face? 
[02:54:00]  Every other day.  I'm in the shower.  It's like fucking a bunch of strokes across.  I lift the fucking scrotum a couple of discs.  Do you ever cut your bag with the razor?  No.  How do you not cut your bag with the fucking razor?  Because I'm careful.  He's got skills.  That's crazy.  Were you here when I told the story?  What happened?  I decided to take an electric razor to my ball bag because it got a little too wild  because I got a kid now makes it a little harder.  The skin's crazy.  And it punctured my ball bag.  I had eight little tiny little holes with fucking blood dripping from it. 
[02:54:30]  And the little babies come dripping out of it.  I fucked up.  Yeah.  Instead of going across, obviously, how I fucking hit my ball bag.  Eight quick holes within a half a second.  You're giving me even more reasons to never do that again, ever.  No, I don't know.  Just slip with the razor and it will cut across the head of the dick like that.  Oh, jeez.  What the fuck are you doing?  Put it over the holes.  I use a straight razor.  I use a straight razor down there just to make it fun.  Just to scare him.  Just to make him think it's like the Godfather.  A Sweeney Todd fucking shave on your dick. 
[02:55:00]  I don't know.  But that's another thing.  A guy would never have imagined trimming down his pubes.  It's like this is what it is.  This is where we've gone.  I'm a man.  Yeah.  Because being covered in hair, Burt Reynolds, Magnum P.I.  Those guys are covered in hair.  Covered.  They were like little rugs.  And it's like, oh, that's how you were.  Those guys were men.  Now if you have that much hair, there's something wrong with you.  And you're like a gorilla.  You're like Robin Williams.  Mine comes in patchy.  I gotta shave some stuff.  Back hair comes in patchy.  So you just got like one patch?  Like a crazy mole with the hair coming out of it? 
[02:55:30]  No, no joke.  And one on the other side.  That's weird.  Oh, it's horrible.  If it was like even, I wouldn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  And what about patchy?  What's the big thing going on with hair care and guys these days?  Oh, my God.  Well, the amazing thing is because we filmed a, we went and filmed a surgery where they  do the hair replacement surgery.  Oh, yes.  Which that is such a bloody process.  Because what they do is they cut, they actually cut a strip out of the back of your head.  You gotta tell me.  Yeah.  They cut that strip and then they like, they insert those hairs in the front of your head  so it's your own hair.  Individual follicles placed artistically in the direction your hair grows. 
[02:56:00]  That's right.  It's amazing.  And then, but we shot that and I was like, it was so fantastic, gory and bloody.  I was like, if we put that in the film, people are going to be completely disgusted.  Oh, you should have.  I said, I want to find guys with, let's find some guys with rugs who are rocking rugs  who love the idea of still having rugs.  And so we started chasing these guys who had toupees and we found up in the, up in Yonkers  Mr. Carmine.  So there's this guy who's been making rugs for decades, who he's got this whole system  where he makes molds of everybody's head.  They come in, he makes that, makes that, he literally does it by hand, creates a toupee 
[02:56:30]  for you.  Watching in the film, you're like, he puts this sloppy wet dog on somebody's head.  You're like, oh my God, that looks terrible.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Then he keeps cutting, keeps talking, keeps cutting, keeps talking.  And by the time he's done, you would never know the guy was wearing it.  Come on.  It's amazing.  Amazing.  I saw the flight attendant come home.  Never would have believed it.  And you have to go see him and he replaces them every month.  So every month he like, he peels it off your head and he puts a new one on.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's gotta be big business.  It's like anywhere between a hundred and like 500 bucks a month.  That's the guy thing.  We hate losing our hair, man. 
[02:57:00]  It looks ridiculous.  The flight attendant coming back was an older guy.  He had a fucking frosted.  Right.  But it was a wig.  A frosted rug?  Dude, I kept going to the bathroom trying to see the glue.  Like I, cause he looked like he was like 45.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he had hair.  It was like fucking eighties.  It's like, he could have been in the fucking.  Oh, Mickey.  You're so funny.  He could have been in that video.  Yeah.  It just looked out of place on him, but he did look younger than he would have.  Yeah.  But it was frosted.  Wow.  I love the guys where it's a different color on the sides. 
[02:57:30]  Thank you.  That's exactly what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thick fucking sideburns that are dark.  Well, gray, whatever.  And it doesn't match the rest of it.  And then the side of the wig is like, you can see in the back and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, as far as the hair, uh, replacement surgery.  Yeah.  Are they advancing?  I mean, I met a guy.  What is that?  No, we interviewed a guy who literally, his hairline was here.  His hairline was like way right to here.  Really?  And you wouldn't even be able to tell.  Like, he's had complete hair replacement surgery.  He had this full head of hair.  I mean, it was remarkable.  It's amazing. 
[02:58:00]  Like, the guy's head was bananas.  I was just thinning a little bit and had it done.  That's fucking amazing.  Yeah, but you're five, you're four, you're four years in probably.  Yeah.  So I'm wondering in that four years if it's gotten even better.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I mean, I think it gets better all the time.  I'm just asking.  Yeah.  But it's one of those things where like, no, it's like, I'm thinning.  Like, I'm thinning like crazy.  Would you do it?  And that's what they said.  They said, well, you should come.  You should come in for a consultation.  And I was like, I don't know if I want to come in for the consultation.  Would you do it though?  I mean, I mean, just like, one day I'm just going to pull the Norton.  I'm just going to go.  Shave? 
[02:58:30]  I'm going to come over at the new millennium.  That's right.  Someone sees you, dude.  Well, Mr. Carmine says in the film it's amazing because he talks about people who shave  their heads.  He goes, people love to think that they look like a Michael Jordan.  And he goes, but you look ridiculous.  He goes, you got a head.  He goes, you know who looks good with a bald head?  The guy with a big head and a little ears and a squashed nose.  He goes, that looks good.  Everybody else would look ridiculous.  Black guys can pull it off.  Yeah.  A lot of black guys can rock it.  Some white guys, yes.  And like, yeah, some badass looking white guys can do it.  Most black guys can do it. 
[02:59:00]  If you pull off the skinhead, you look good with it.  I got a little gray on the side, so I keep it short now because I got a little bit of  that gray, man.  There's nothing you can do about it.  There are some people that just look like they're on chemo.  That's right.  It really does.  That's my problem.  I'm like so skinny and I don't tan.  Like, I'm so sickly looking already.  Like, the day I shave my head, I'm going to look like I'm straight out of Philadelphia.  Shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Guys are very self-conscious with that whole thing.  Well, because that's your man. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  If you have hair, then you're a man.  But then there's the guys who say, well, you know, if you have more testosterone,  it makes your hair fall out.  And I'm like, as told to me by a bald guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's going to make up any excuses.  What about bitch tits?  Yeah.  You should definitely do something about that.  Well, lipo.  A lot of guys are getting lights right now.  We showed the film.  We had a premiere in Los Angeles.  And there was a plastic surgeon who came up to me after the film.  He's like, I'm so glad you made this film.  Because you've got to understand, 45% of my business now are guys.  Wow.  Almost half the people that come to see me are guys coming in to get plastic surgery. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, it's crazy what's happening.  Doesn't lipo leave little scars on you?  No, not because they do it with the, they do it, it's not a vase where they don't have  to cut you.  They basically put in the one, two, what's it called?  Where they, ah, tubes.  It's like laparoscopics.  It's like laparoscopics.  It's all laparoscopics.  They literally go in one little hole and then move it around and suck the fat out.  Oh, man.  It's crazy.  That must hurt though.  Well, I doubt it feels that great.  But you look so good.  Isn't it looking good worth a little pain?  What if it's lumpy and uneven?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I think.  You're the good guy. 
[03:00:30]  It's, it's, it's a lot art.  It's not just science.  It's art.  You got to go to somebody that is an artist when it comes to sucking fat out of your body.  That past art class?  Yeah.  I would want to get my sides done, my gut, my fucking tits, the side of my tits.  But you're not going to end up looking like an economist.  I bet there's a plastic surgeon listening right now who would love to do that for you.  I just, but I'm afraid I'll come and be all cottage cheesy and shit.  I would so do that.  I worked out my whole life and I can't keep up with it anymore.  It's like you work out and there's, there's still certain places like you have to completely 
[03:01:00]  change so much.  Like that little back of the love handle right there.  Like to get rid of that, like I can't get rid of that.  It'll take, it'll take, it'd take me five years of just not eating.  Like I'd have to be cast away on an island somewhere.  You got to realize, but are you with girls that really care?  Yeah.  They look at me and they look at me and they're like, give me that look.  I like being with a girl.  As I'm peeling my manks off in the room.  I like being with a girl that's willing to settle.  All right.  It is easier that way.  Whatever.  By week two of a relationship, she's like, yeah, just fuck me with your shirt on. 
[03:01:30]  I got it.  Fine.  And then take me out to dinner again.  Just remind me.  Yeah.  Remind me.  Wine and dine me.  Remind me why I'm with you.  We care more about it than women do.  Sure.  But what turns them on is different than necessarily what turns us on.  Right.  Gay men, I think, had a lot to do with that manscaping too.  Completely.  Because they're in such impeccable shape.  Yeah.  You know, if guys judge things so fucking harshly, you know?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Why do the gay guys try so hard?  Well, I think because you're fighting for a pool.  You're fighting for a pool.  It's very competitive.  It's very competitive out there.  Yeah.  It's a smaller pool than, you know, all the women out there, I guess.  Yeah.  There's a pond with a few fish, but they all have big cocks and good abs.  Every fish has eight inches.  I'm going to see this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  You guys like it.  It's a really funny film.  I saw you on a few talk shows talking about this and I thought it looked really good.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  I don't think you've made a bad movie, Morgan.  Well, thanks.  I really don't.  Very fun.  Comic-Con episode four.  So yeah, we did a film all about San Diego Comic-Con and the pop culture mecca that  has geeked them.  Cool, man.  I wish we had more time with you, but the show's over.  It's all good.  Thanks for having me.  Great to see you guys.  What do we got here?  It opens...  It opens today.  Today.  It's nationwide.  Starting today, May 18th.  Mansom.  Very cool.  MansomTheMovie.com.  You can find a theater near you.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, guys.  Great to see you.  Jimmy, what do you got going on? 
[03:03:00]  Anything?  We'll meet DiPaolo and Artie and Attell in a little while if they're here.  What a rape?  Yes.  You fucking creeps.  No, it's a little trick with a cracker.  And we'll be running on Raw Dogs soon.  We're promoting June 9th at the Foxwoods in Connecticut.  Try to get those guys on the show.  Very good.  I don't know if they're here yet.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Morgan.  Awesome.  Thanks, man.  And I guess we'll see you Monday.  Fuck.  The O.P. and Anthony show is pretty much over. 
[03:03:30]  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live, it's next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
