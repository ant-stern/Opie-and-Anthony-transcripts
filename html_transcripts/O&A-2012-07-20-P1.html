<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily focused on the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting during a midnight showing of *The Dark Knight Rises*.  The show opened with immediate reactions to the breaking news, with the hosts speculating on the shooter's profile ("crazy white guy"), weapon arsenal (multiple weapons, gas mask, possible explosives), and motives.  Initial reports indicated at least 14, then 15, deaths and numerous injuries.  The hosts aired a live phone interview with a witness describing the chaotic scene and the rapid police response.  Strong and offensive language was used throughout the segment by both the hosts and callers.  Live audio from an Aurora police scanner provided updates on the investigation, including the search of the shooter's apartment and the processing of evidence.  Information about a potential suspect, Ruben Gutierrez, surfaced from social media and scanner chatter.  The hosts sarcastically mentioned Chick-fil-A's offer of assistance to law enforcement. Further witness and expert calls provided additional details. The segment consistently updated the casualty count, discussed gun control, criticized MSNBC's news coverage (compared to CNN and Fox News), and speculated on the shooter's possible attempt to survive the attack and the timing of the attack to coincide with a scene in the movie.

The following segments continued this intense focus on the shooting.  Eyewitness accounts detailed the shooter entering through an exit door, firing on the audience (potentially timed with a movie scene), deploying tear gas, and the resulting panic.  Callers provided updates on victim conditions at area hospitals.  The lack of comprehensive coverage on MSNBC was repeatedly criticized.  The hosts and callers continued using extremely offensive language and speculated on the shooter's motives and access to the theater, along with whether he acted alone.  Discussion included gun control and media response, with frequent criticism of Piers Morgan. The unrelated story of Fred Willard's alleged masturbation in an adult theater was briefly mentioned as a humorous contrast. Donald Trump Jr. called in, offering his perspective on the shooter's psychopathy and questioning gun control's effectiveness.  Information was gathered from various news sources, eyewitness accounts, and social media, particularly Twitter.

Another segment further explored the rapidly changing and contradictory news reports surrounding the shooting, including the casualty count and suspect identity.  Speculation on the shooter's motives and personality relied on fragmented information from news coverage and social media, including his potential Facebook page.  A caller described the scene near the shooter's residence, detailing the police response (bomb squad, SWAT). The hosts joked about inaccuracies and repetition in mainstream media coverage.  A discussion about one of the co-host's recently opened Scottish golf course provided a brief break from the shooting coverage.  A therapist, Steve, called in offering a professional opinion on the shooter's possible psychological profile.  Donald Trump Jr. made a second brief call, discussing his work and unrelated topics.  Vulgar and offensive language was prevalent throughout.


Finally, the broadcast included a segment unrelated to the shooting.  It began with a discussion of the short-lived Ben Stiller Show, its timeslot opposite *60 Minutes*, and its cast and crew (Judd Apatow, Janine Garofalo, Andy Dick, David Cross).  Anecdotes about the challenging work environment at *Saturday Night Live*, including stories about Chris Farley (including an incident involving defecation), were shared.  The conversation shifted to Bob Odenkirk (in-studio guest), discussing his role in *Breaking Bad*, the show's success, Saul Goodman's popularity, Walter White's character arc, and Odenkirkâ€™s filming experiences, including his writing process, memorization techniques, and inspiration for the character (Robert Evans).  The segment concluded with further discussion of Fred Willard's controversial news story and promotion of the hosts' upcoming Chicago live shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  We got an UGG.  We got to do an UGG.  Every once in a while we come in here and you got to do an UGG.  An UGG show.  Big story.  Huge story.  My post-birthday?  Yeah, your post-birthday celebration. 
[00:00:30]  Why don't I just play the news clip to get everything going here?  Oh, well.  Because it's so brand new and then we'll go with it.  Breaking news of a deadly movie theater shooting near Denver, Colorado.  Authorities say at least 14 people were killed during the showing of the new Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.  You're looking at live pictures there.  No, we're not.  Close to 40 others are being treated for injuries.  Witnesses told investigators that the gunman kicked in one of the theater exits, threw a smoke bomb, and opened fire. 
[00:01:00]  Police have a suspect in custody.  Police officers responded and found the gunman in the back of the theater outside in the parking lot near a car in possession of a gas mask and at least a rifle and a handgun.  There are additional, there's at least one additional weapon that was found inside. 
[00:01:30]  The shooting apparently went on for some time.  As of right now, we have approximately 50 who were hit and we have 14 dead.  10 in theater and 4 died at area hospitals.  A horrible and terrifying situation there.  The suspect made reference to possible explosives.  As a result, an apartment building in North Aurora has been evacuated as police search for possible explosives. 
[00:02:00]  And that's how we start today's show.  Damn, son.  Now we don't, they're saying, someone said, who said that they thought it looked like an Indian male?  Well, that's the only reason I'm thinking it could be terrorism, like a terrorist.  Just one of the news channels.  This has crazy white guy crime written all over it.  Might be, though.  Might be this ideal opportunity for somebody if they wanted to make some type of statement.  But this is crazy white guy crime. 
[00:02:30]  It definitely is.  And it's like, especially at that movie.  Yeah, yeah.  But why, who described it as an Indian guy?  Some reports that were coming in.  Just a suspect.  I mean, a witness.  Okay.  I mean, maybe that's not for me.  No, I mean, this story is so brand new that just a lot of stuff is being thrown out there right now.  I'd have shot him in the face.  Well, you know.  Probably would have cowed.  Coward under a seat.  Yeah, he had a lot of weapons.  Oh, he did.  14 dead.  That number's going to be a lot higher. 
[00:03:00]  Because a lot of the people that are bringing to area hospitals are in critical condition.  Yeah.  Midnight showing of Batman.  Damn.  Yeah, I guess as the day goes on, they're going to get more details.  But, oof.  That's brutal.  It probably is some crazy white.  Some disgruntled.  Oh.  And what they'll do...  I'm sure they'll have a manifesto.  Oh, yeah.  And the news will talk about it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of just talking about what a fucking little worm this guy is.  What a piece of shit. 
[00:03:30]  A real piece of garbage.  They build these guys up to be like, wow.  They contribute to making these guys legendary in a way, which makes other guys want to do it.  Yep.  This is close to Columbine, too, they're pointing out.  Fucking Colorado, man.  There's a lot of weird shit that happens in that thing.  How close to Columbine?  Like, what do they mean?  20 miles.  20 miles from Columbine.  They got like a fucking...  That thin air.  I don't know.  Yeah, there's something going on.  What the fuck that shit is.  Fucking breathe.  That's crazy.  It's pretty deeper or something.  Get some oxygen.  On TV, it's just... 
[00:04:00]  There's still obviously those all cops outside the movie theater.  Yeah.  Oh, it's brand new, man.  I mean, it was a midnight showing and it's 417 in Colorado.  Or Aurora, Colorado.  Oh, right.  What happened towards the end of the movie?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  It's a very fresh story.  Like, he couldn't breathe.  I was like, what the heck's going on, you know?  James, it's Peter Johnson.  Were there police at the theater when you arrived there for the Batman showing?  Did there seem to be a lot of security there? 
[00:04:30]  Did there seem to be anything special that was going on outside of a happy event of seeing a premiere of a new movie?  Yeah, there was an Aurora police officer.  And also, there was a heavy, heavy security presence there.  You know, there was like a river and a cops.  But there was an Aurora police officer just coasting the parking lot making sure people weren't hanging out in their cars like they normally would.  In an event like this, yeah.  And describe it for us, you know, as it began to unfold.  And we understand canine units were there.  FBI on the scene.  You know, police from every possible area coming in to help. 
[00:05:00]  FBI.  Yeah, it was crazy.  I mean, it's like the law enforcement thought of the sky, you know.  Just one second, I'm dealing with my friend.  And then the next second, I'm yelling, we need help.  And I'm on the cell phone going crazy.  And it seemed like a snap of a finger.  There's police everywhere.  I mean, they...  Gunmen used at least three guns.  One rifle, one handgun, one gun stashed in theater.  Probably threw it.  And he threw the gun. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, ten died in the movie theater, four on the way to the hospital.  So far.  Eh, this never bodes well for gun control, you know.  Is that what you're worried about right now?  Well, no.  But in the long run, it's one of those things where, you know, this is one of those opportunities that people use.  People use it to...  They use it and go, oh, we got, you know, I think a nut like this would have gotten his hands on what he wanted. 
[00:06:00]  Your thought being...  Regardless.  But your thought being if there was other people in the theater with guns...  Hey, you know, if somebody was at least, you know, maybe nothing could have been done, no matter who had what.  But maybe if somebody was close enough, you know, somebody thought about it, saw him right there, you know, could have taken a fucking shot at him.  He had a bulletproof vest on.  Yeah.  So he was ready.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Shoot him in the face.  Which shows you, though, again, this goes more towards...  I don't know who this leans towards because it does make you...  He wanted to survive.  He wasn't trying to get...  He wasn't trying to commit suicide.  But maybe he just wanted to, you know, get a little more longevity so he can take people out more instead of surviving.  But they did take him alive, so...  Why do they have to take him alive?  That's what frustrates me.  Yeah, well, that's what the cops do.  Could have just unloaded on him, right? 
[00:07:00]  Free?  Freeze.  Please.  Now we're going to have to see the guy and then it'll be glorified and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He began shooting before the movie started.  Covered with blood.  Yeah, showing a guy walking out with black lights.  Who, I believe, heard that press conference and is the up-to-the-minute details on this horrific tragedy in Aurora, Colorado that started late last night.  It really is a horrific tragedy and you can see people showing up here at the shooting location, people that are just waking up to this news. 
[00:07:30]  What we know is going on at this moment is the chief of police tells us that they are currently searching the shooter's home.  Apparently, when one of these officers took the shooter into custody, he made some statements.  Number one, that he had the incendiary device in the car.  As you said, they had recovered that.  He also said that he had an incendiary device at his home here in Aurora.  And we are told the police are searching his home right now.  Just to update the latest.  What we know, as you said, 14 people confirmed dead.  We're told as many as 10 to 12 inside the theater. 
[00:08:00]  There are 50 people injured.  You spoke with the witness a moment ago.  Naturally, they counted coming out of there.  People say this man stood up.  He was apparently wearing some form of body armor or what looked like body armor.  He turned around and was wearing a gas mask.  And they say at that point, one witness described it as two bombs went off.  We now know that that was tear gas.  When the tear gas went to this theater, there was sort of a mass panic.  People started running.  And this man simply started shooting.  We are told many of those dead inside the theater are children and teenagers.  I'm told by one witness that a baby was shot at almost point-blank range while his family was right next to him. 
[00:08:30]  Jesus.  So these people that are showing up here at the shooting scene are just beginning to learn that it is a tragedy that's unfolding here in Aurora, Colorado.  It's just awful.  Justin, there are a couple of stories out there, and we don't know exactly how this started.  Are you under the impression that the gunman was in the theater at the time the movie started or, as one of the local Denver affiliates is reporting this morning, he kicked an emergency door down and came in that way? 
[00:09:00]  I don't have that information.  What I know in talking from police sources as well as witnesses is that the previous had played, it was around 1230, and that's when this individual simply stood up, is what I was told.  Okay.  And turned around and faced the audience.  So whether he made his way in through one of the emergency exits, I simply don't know that.  I didn't get a mask in.  I didn't get a rifle in.  Oh, no, the midnight showings, everyone dresses up, so it was perfect.  Do they really?  Yeah, man.  They go all in.  Oh, what?  They get all festive.  Do you know that's maybe, if that's accurate, maybe that's why he fucking chose that showing, because he could go dressed up. 
[00:09:30]  He could probably, they keep saying a gas mask, but it probably looked kind of like the Bane character.  Right, right, right.  Kind of.  Or at least people go, oh, he's dressed as Bane, even though it was a tear gas mask.  Fuck.  Yeah, man.  These people, they dress all up for the midnight showings of these big movies.  How much, by the way, does MSNBC stink?  Oh, my God.  They have Morning Joe on right now?  Yeah.  And they're talking about Obamacare.  It's like.  There's no seniors who worry about them, and will they be taken care of?  And this is really one of the biggest problems. 
[00:10:00]  That's why they have no fucking viewers.  Yeah, me and Ann were.  MSNBC, no viewers.  That's why no one watches your shitty network.  Dummy.  Me and Ann were talking just before you got here, Jimmy, and they started with the story, and they're like,  okay, they're going with it, and then literally three minutes later, they're doing other news.  I'm like, well, you just are out of touch.  No one that's watching the news is watching that.  Yeah, everybody wants to know this.  The plates, is that right?  That's what I'm hearing from police sources as well.  We're hearing that both that he had Tennessee plate, that there was an incendiary device located in his car, 
[00:10:30]  but we are also told that he does have a residence here in Aurora.  Okay.  So that's where they're searching right now.  In terms of the gang unit responding, are you aware of any history in Aurora in terms of gang activity in that town?  I'm given to understand also that there's been a curfew in the past for citizens.  Gang activity?  That's crazy.  That's crazy white guy.  Gang, gang, gang.  This is crazy white guy.  This is crazy white guy.  Or Muslim extremists. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  That's pretty much it.  Gang activity?  What are you talking about?  Gang, gang, gang.  These guys just hit every angle because they said that the police and gang, the gang police,  I was like, all right, let's just go with that.  It's like everyone showed up for this one, believe me.  In Aurora, the Aurora PD, I think the fucking secretary showed up.  Joseph, he's been doing a great job reporting out in Denver.  We thank you very much for the live report from Aurora, Colorado.  And folks, if you're just waking up with us at 625 on this Friday morning, 
[00:11:30]  some terrible news to let you know about.  In Aurora, Colorado, the chief of police telling us there at a news briefing  that 10 people were killed on sight of a movie theater  at the opening of The Dark Knight Rises.  And then four others were later reported dead in area hospitals.  And this was a sold-out showing, you know, across the country, a midnight showing.  And you two, you know, it seems that there is just a dark cloud  hanging over these Batman movies. 
[00:12:00]  The last one that came out, Heath Ledger, you know.  And not only that, but then we're also thinking about the images from Columbine.  I mean, there are just so many parallels here.  It certainly casts a cloud, and we know it's so close to Columbine.  There's no parallels.  On the phone now is Jackie Montgomery, University of Colorado, Denver.  And he blew by her.  He blew by this fucking dumb broad.  Good morning, Miss Montgomery.  They all just fail you in the end.  How many folks have been brought to your hospital?  What condition are they in?  He hasn't had a drug overdose.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[00:12:30]  After the filming of the movie.  Family members coming to the hospital to see their loved ones.  There's a dark cloud over the movie Gone with the Wind,  because I think a lot of people are dead.  We have 20 patients that were taking care of.  That starred in that movie.  It's cursed.  Well, you kid.  There's a dark cloud over this radio show.  Jesus.  If you want to go with that shit.  Unbelievable.  We have a handful of teenagers.  I don't know the exact number.  But we're really focused on just providing them terrific care.  That's horrible.  That's awful.  The baby thing literally made me puke in my mouth.  That's pretty fucked up.  That's some roofless shit.  Suspect found is this instant feedbacker. 
[00:13:00]  It says Ruben...  Kincaid?  Ruben Kincaid seems to be in custody per police scanner.  Easy to find on Facebook.  It's Ruben Gutierrez.  Gutierrez?  G-U-T-I-E-R-R-E-Z.  Is he a...  I'm just going with this, because it's Hispanic.  You know, this could be completely wrong by this instant feedbacker, but it's so fresh.  We got to like...  If he's listening to the... 
[00:13:30]  Police scanner.  Click on one of those.  Who knows, right?  Yeah, you never know.  Click on one of those.  You never know.  Maybe this guy's got some fucking...  Maybe that's why he was mistakenly identified as an Indian guy, possibly.  If he's Spanish, maybe it was mistaken.  That's in Spanish, huh?  Yeah.  That's in Spanish.  Look up...  Well, anybody else have any info?  Where's he from?  San Antonio.  Ah, that ain't it.  No.  San Antonio.  Why don't you look up his name and then... 
[00:14:00]  And put Aurora.  Aurora, right.  Or Colorado.  Just put Colorado.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Colorado.  Look, this could be a dead end, obviously, but...  15 people named...  Oh, 60 people named...  Spokio.  Uh...  Littleton, Colorado.  My life.  Ruben Gutierrez.  Huh?  Littleton.  Let's say he has a residence in Aurora.  Four.  Huh?  I think I'm 44.  Uh...  Sure. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, given our proximity to the local airport and, you know, we're a major city,  that, uh, we've heard...  We have, um...  We've had airplane incidents and other things like that happen, so, uh, the team here is  well-prepared to handle anything like this.  That dumb woman.  I know you trained for it, but at the same time when it happens, it's embarrassing, right?  Right.  Who the fuck would say that?  Fox News.  Uh, all right.  Uh, Jackie McGovern, University of Colorado, at the hospital center.  We thank you very much for joining us.  Thank you. 
[00:15:00]  Bye-bye.  Can you imagine?  I mean, you just go...  You go to the movies to escape reality.  As soon as you don't know it at the moment, you've got somebody's cell phone video of  what was happening just outside the Century 16 movie theater, uh, just a couple hours  ago, where you go in just to escape reality, and then some guy...  We understand what a movie is, motherfucker!  Yeah.  You get your popcorn, you get your call...  Shut up!  Can you just imagine?  You got your popcorn, you're escaping reality, you know what, Dad? 
[00:15:30]  You're sitting there, boom, and then you hear boom, and then boom, there's more booms!  Boom, there's more booms!  ...going to this movie show, a midnight showing of the Batman movie.  The Batman.  The Batman.  I just say Batman.  And I can still imagine, uh, across, uh, Aurora and the area, the fear and the anxiety  of parents wanting to know, you know, are there children coming home, uh, tonight?  Oh, really?  From James, the witness, earlier, about seeing a little girl shot, and a mother cradling  that little girl. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, boy.  And something, obviously, that will stay with him forever.  Yeah, emotional wounds for so many of those people.  Throughout their lives.  Um, we're getting more and more details as, as time goes on now.  Uh, we know that at least...  Well, at least they're covering this, as opposed to MSNBC, who's doing the Emmys.  And, uh, I guess, Willie, the question is, uh, what happens, uh, if Heilman, uh, wins  a couple of them?  Seriously?  Halpern has humility.  I'm not worried about that.  Has he gone to Hollywood already? 
[00:16:30]  What a fucking, terrible fucking network.  He went to Hollywood a long time ago.  They're talking about the Emmy nominations.  And they sit there, every time the ratings come out, they have to sit there and think,  why are we losing to Fox every time?  Why do we get beat the fuck up?  Now they're going to do an Olympics break.  Nice.  Why do we get beat every time by Fox News?  Why is it we're doing more news than MSNBC?  Uh, a guy, uh, who's simply one years old.  Holy shit.  This movie theater you're seeing on your screen right now, a brand new movie theater, we 
[00:17:00]  should mention, by the way, packed with people to see the Batman premiere of that movie.  Uh, open fire in one of the theaters, killing at least 14 people at this hour.  50 people have been taken to area hospitals.  Fortunately, there are about four excellent hospitals in that area where victims have been brought in.  The injuries at this hour range from, uh, more modest injuries to more severe injuries.  The gunman apparently had a long-arm rifle and also two handguns. 
[00:17:30]  We are hearing at this hour that one of the handguns may have been stashed in that theater at an earlier time.  Uh, we are also hearing from witnesses at the scene that the suspect threw some kind of a canister into that theater.  Witnesses then say they report hearing some sort of a hissing sound and then appear to see, uh, some sort of a smoke.  So some believe that this might have been, uh, some sort of a tear gas.  And that is when the man opened fire.  He shot between 10 to 20 rounds from this long arm and also from two pistols. 
[00:18:00]  We are hearing then that the gunman ran out of the theater into the parking lot.  And that is where his car was parked.  We should mention at this hour that police have taken down this guy.  One suspect is in police custody.  No other suspects at this time.  But that is certainly something that police will continue to investigate.  Police are searching his car.  We are hearing that it is a white vehicle.  And apparently there are some sort of explosives that have been found in that car.  What kind of explosives? 
[00:18:30]  We do not know that at this hour.  Now that suspect also talking with police officials and indicating to them that he has some sort of explosive device in his apartment in Aurora, Colorado.  I think those are the pictures that we are seeing right now at this time.  Actually, that appears to be the picture of his vehicle that I just mentioned, a white vehicle.  You can't see it, though, because the fucking Fox Chiron is in front of him.  They have Tennessee license plates.  Oh, God, what are they doing?  If anyone out there has any information on who the suspect might be, you are asked to please call police in Aurora, Colorado with information at that. 
[00:19:00]  Back to his apartment.  Police officials are searching this guy's apartment for any possible explosive device there.  We understand that that apartment complex has been evacuated at this hour so that neighbors there are considered safe.  Here's what we know about the suspect.  A young adult man in his 20s.  No word yet as to this person's motive.  Again, the ton of the license plates, that is not confirmed at this time.  We are hearing, though, from a lot of witnesses. 
[00:19:30]  Keep in mind that this theater was a packed theater.  So many young people out on summer break wanting to go see this Batman movie.  Tremendously popular.  We're told that this movie was, in fact, sold out.  Of course it was.  The movie theater was packed.  We are hearing from one person, Benjamin Fernandez.  You can see some of the pictures from that movie theater right there.  Benjamin Fernandez says that he was watching the movie and that he heard a series of explosions.  He said that people ran from the theater and there were gunshots then.  Police shouting, get down, get down. 
[00:20:00]  This witness says he saw people falling, including one young girl.  We also understand that some of the victims were adults.  Some of the victims were teenagers.  And there is one report that one of the victims may be just a one-year-old baby.  Well, police have set up a command post near Dillard's department store.  They are interviewing hundreds of possible witnesses at this hour.  Some of those witnesses were taken by buses to Gateway Hospital, excuse me, Gateway High School. 
[00:20:30]  They're being questioned there.  A police spokeswoman says that that scene is still very active.  Again, if you were just joining at this hour, 14 victims are dead, many of them children, many of them teenagers.  Somebody on Twitter is saying the movie, they're saying the movie had just started.  So maybe it just began.  Yeah, we got that out there, right?  I didn't know what part of the movie was it.  40 minutes.  Yeah, no, it just started.  Oh, 40?  Or early on in the movie.  Do you fucking, it's like...  She did a really good job, by the way.  Yeah, there you go.  Summed it up, right?  She was on it.  Sorry, MSNBC is getting their commercials in. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, there they go.  Oh, there they go.  Denver, about 10 miles east of Denver.  Police now say 15 people are dead.  The last time we talked, the death toll was 14.  That has now ticked up to 15 dead, at least 50 more wounded in a shooting at a movie theater.  According to the Denver Post, the man is 24 years old.  The suspect is in custody.  The incident happened local time at a mall in Aurora, about, as I said, 10 miles east of the city.  KUSA, our NBC station there in Denver, reports dozens of people have been transported to a nearby hospital. 
[00:21:30]  Reports say the shooting happened during a late showing of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises.  According to witnesses there, the shooter, wearing all black, kicked in the emergency exit door in Theater 9,  walked to the front of the theater, stood in front of the screen, threw some kind of a smoke-producing bomb,  and then began shooting at random.  Witnesses say he was wearing a gas mask.  Police say he was carrying a rifle, a knife, and a gun. 
[00:22:00]  His apartment now is being evacuated and searched by police for explosive devices based on some information the suspect gave when he was arrested.  You know what? I'll bet this guy planned on doing other shit that night.  The police say the man was arrested without incident.  He did not resist. He did not put up a fight.  In fact, the police chief in Aurora, Dan Oates, calling this a, quote, horrific event, I should say.  No evidence, though, of other shooters so far.  Just shoot him in the fucking head.  People are like, how do you feel about the death penalty? What do you think? 
[00:22:30]  All in for the death penalty.  Or at least cut one of his hands off.  Yeah.  Just cut him.  Like, there is something to be said for Saudi Arabia doing that.  Their reasoning is a little crazy, but the thought isn't bad.  Yeah.  But now, you're right.  This scumbag, his thoughts and opinions will be out there.  Oh, you're going to hear all of his fucking ideology.  Then he gets to go to jail and be protected.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because he's a high profile.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  But his car, if there was a bomb in his car, and he had stuff at home still, and a bulletproof vest, 
[00:23:00]  he was probably planning on running out of this theater and going somewhere, either getting  away or going somewhere else and finishing the job around the other side of the...  Maybe.  He might have been planning on going out to the front of the theater as they ran out and  doing something.  Yeah.  Or maybe he figured he had enough bombs to take into the theater, too.  But he didn't blow it up.  That's why it's...  Why would you leave your bomb in the car?  No, he let tear gas off in the theater, though.  It's also odd that he was taken without any incident. 
[00:23:30]  Usually, these guys, when it's crazy white guy, they either go out in a blaze...  They keep going, right?  ...or they shoot themselves or something, you know?  I'm sorry.  Sam just put up.  Witness said that the shooting started at the start of the shooting scene in the new...  When was the shooting scene?  Do you guys remember?  Oh, yeah.  It's in...  I don't remember when that happened.  The beginning of the movie, where it's just...  The beginning of the movie, they got, like...  Yeah, well, that's the airplane scene.  Yeah, but that's...  So this guy...  Okay. 
[00:24:00]  If that's true, either he was just waiting, but if this guy had fucking...  If that's true, and he was able to play...  Like, he knew that when that was happening...  Yeah.  He had probably seen the movie already, which means he was probably a theater employee who saw  a screening.  I think it's a coincidence.  Maybe.  I think he just decided, okay, it's go time.  Yeah.  You let everyone settle in and get into the movie, and then it's go time.  I think.  I don't know.  You might be right, too.  Craziness.  And he was in a...  She said a riot helmet.  She said he had a bulletproof vest on. 
[00:24:30]  You know, she said that he was completely covered in all black with goggles.  And she said that after that point, when she saw that he was holding a shotgun, her and  her boyfriend dropped to the floor and just kind of started to crawl to see if they could  get away.  When she turned around, all she saw was the guy slowly making his way up the stairs and  just firing.  The first calls to police came out of that movie theater at 1239 local time, almost exactly 
[00:25:00]  four hours ago.  Police say they were on the scene within one or two minutes.  Again, the police chief there describing it as a, quote, horrific event, a scene one officer  described as police officers dragging bodies out of that movie theater.  Again, the update right now, 15 people dead.  I think you might be right, Jimmy.  I don't think he expected the cops to be on the scene within, excuse me, two minutes,  you know?  Yeah.  But I guess there were police in the area because it was such a, you know...  He must have seen them as he was pulling up. 
[00:25:30]  I mean...  Huh?  No, maybe he was parked in the back.  If he kicked in that theater door exit, he was...  And another odd thing to notice, his car, maybe you don't think of this, but his car was  parked, like he pulled his car into a spot.  So maybe he wasn't...  Because if you're going to plan on just taking off, wouldn't you back your car into a spot?  I mean, maybe that's just in that moment you're not thinking, but...  Right.  That just struck me as odd that his car is parked where he'd have to back it up to leave.  Yeah.  He was well prepared, that's for sure. 
[00:26:00]  And now they're saying MSNBC has been covering it all morning.  No.  No.  And again, I'm...  I know, we've been here...  They're doing all commercials.  I mean, we've been on since six o'clock.  They have done five minutes up front and another five.  So they've done 10 minutes out of 40.  Get those commercials in.  You guys had a lot of trouble breathing.  Yeah, because I don't think Fox has gone to commercials.  No, they haven't.  Nine.  Because the air conditioning and the circulation was on, it was in your...  Okay, if you, if any of you or your guys need anything, let me know and I'll find you a relief for... 
[00:26:30]  Police scanner?  Yeah.  Sounds good.  Yeah, this is Aurora.  214 Adam to Lincoln 25.  I'm assuming there's still one.  Center block.  What?  What was that?  Uh...  Yes, we still want center tech blocked.  What?  And one of the officers that just got relieved from Abilene, um, who wants to take the field that Lincoln 25 was talking about to the east of the theater? 
[00:27:00]  Well, they're just distributing resources.  All right, thank you.  I think that can be covered from Sable.  I don't know what, this isn't my ringtone.  25, I got a bunch of cars with lights on down there, and Sergeant White's going down now to check the filters and the officers down there with those vehicles, just east of the theater on Sable.  I want to hear, uh, people that are at the apartment.  I think somebody's going to check those cars with their lights on just east of the theater on Sable. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, they're a little skittish.  Just those cars coming down there to check it.  Don't come any closer than those cars.  The squad is still out here working the car.  Oh, they're still working on his, uh, car.  Oh, really?  They don't come any closer to the theater than those cars, because bomb squads still work in the car.  Jesus.  Wow.  Hmm.  That's some crazy shit going on. 
[00:28:00]  2.30.  2.30.  Yeah.  Come on.  This is raw, obviously.  We're just taking a chance here.  2.17.  Be advised, Chick-fil-A is going to open up their doors for us.  Chick-fil-A is going to open up their doors for the officers.  They're hungry?  They're hungry?  They're hungry?  Breaking news.  Oh, they're feeding the cops, though.  At least that's...  Chick-fil-A. 
[00:28:30]  Affirm.  Chick-fil-A is going to be opening up their doors for, uh, the officers if they need to go in there and get something to eat or go to the bathroom.  Breaking news.  All right.  We've got...  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Chick-fil-A opening their doors for police officers to piss and eat.  That's all Chick-fil-A's in the entire country.  Yes.  Every single one of them.  So, officers, feel free.  Yeah.  You don't have any cops listening to this right now walking into Chick-fil-A's and they're going,  I don't know.  What are you talking about? 
[00:29:00]  By the way, um, Chick-fil-A always involved in these tragedies.  It's, uh, it seems amazing.  They're not.  That awful woman.  Because I had...  One of my guys had a car that was full of water ready and it's no longer I'm seeing with you guys.  What?  Let me find, uh, detectives here.  See what we're going to do there.  I don't want any of those cars to find you.  Hey, Cruiser 63, though.  Lincoln 25.  Burnly 10th before.  Double check with them. 
[00:29:30]  But I think they were just, uh, taking photos.  And then they could be, uh, cleaned out.  Okay.  I guess they want...  It's a crime scene, you know?  All three of our cars have EV checked out.  They've got to get all that information.  Okay.  Hmm, if there's bloody vehicles there.  Lincoln 25.  If you eventually get a count of how many we're talking about,  try to get that in front of those people and get those things taken care of quick. 
[00:30:00]  Hmm.  We're out with a Rappahoe County Sheriff cruiser at Abilene in Alameda,  and we can't find the owner.  Can we try to air and have them come get his car?  Sure.  Um, they've been photographed.  Hold on.  Raw feed coming from Arona. 
[00:30:30]  I'm with the Littleton officer.  She's no longer on here.  I think that was the last person that had eyes on him that I know of was those Littleton officers are with.  Yeah.  44.  Today begins Ramadan, by the way.  At Mutualite Command Post.  He says?  Yeah, yeah.  The office is setting up there.  Again, Nicoletti's office will be at the Fire Department Mutualite Command Post.  I'm just speculating.  Lincoln 25, to those guys that have our book walker, 
[00:31:00]  as long as the cars are documented that they were used to transport,  and we've taken pictures of the car and the back seat,  those cars can be decontaminated.  That's a police car, is probably right.  47 square.  Anybody that has a car that needs that,  I'll get crime scene cleaners to the state seat.  Hey, Sarge, we've got a bunch at the hospital.  We've got three at the hospital.  We can't leave right now.  That are full of blood.  Jesus.  Cars.  Hey, Matt, could we maybe have crime scene cleaners go to the hospitals 
[00:31:30]  after those cars have been documented?  Wow.  Yeah, I think we can accommodate that.  If somebody can make a phone call and see what I can get them.  Let me just talk to the four-wheel front, too.  Yeah, you don't realize they've got to, like,  make sure they know who was transported in what car,  where they came from, where they were.  Dispatch to 628.  628.  Can I be vice, please, on a domestic at Lexington Park apartment? 
[00:32:00]  Shut up.  That guy's like, fuck, I've got to go to a domestic.  That guy deals with some drunk wife?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Let me tell you something.  This bitch has been fucking giving me shit.  Do you understand something?  All right.  We're very busy.  Domestic.  Jeez.  Some guy in a wife beater fucking hat.  Right.  This bitch.  Do you know how cranky that cop is going to be when he gets there?  Of course.  What does MSNB talk about?  How did that make you feel? 
[00:32:30]  I didn't like it.  I felt, I went back and looked at what Tom Brokaw said  when they used him in an ad, and Tom was the entirety of a 30-year-old.  They're talking about campaign ads.  My understanding is a dope shit.  The theater.  Because, I mean, if you're a viewer right now,  and you know this is happening,  you're changing the channel.  Right.  Immediately.  And finding whatever you can.  That's how human nature works.  What idiots.  They are stupid.  What idiots.  We, on the Opie and Anthony show,  were playing live audio from the fucking police scanner feed in Aurora, Colorado. 
[00:33:00]  MSNBC is talking about political ads.  Yeah, this is their job, not ours.  What shitheads.  Dummies.  It's unfortunate, and I wish it hadn't.  Let's go stay with the New York Times on your must-reads.  Paul Krugman.  Yes, that's what I've chosen.  I think it's a good one.  Like everyone else following the news,  I've been awestruck, he writes.  By the way, questions about Mr. Romney's career at Bain.  Bain.  Unbelievable.  You can't get enough of fucking Romney and Bain cattle. 
[00:33:30]  Trust me, the Bain thing isn't going away.  You could pick up on that on Monday.  I think it's going to take a back seat, though.  Are you kidding me?  I have been keeping track.  They have done less than 10 minutes on this whole thing.  Fox has not gone to a commercial,  and I'm not saying I'm a Fox guy.  I'm just pointing out the obvious.  You don't need to go to commercial.  Right.  They have not gone to commercial,  and they have not done another story.  Do they comb through tips that they may have gotten?  Do they comb through information to look for clues  as to whether there may have been some indication 
[00:34:00]  about this person in the past  in order to put together other people  that may be part of a web or a conspiracy?  All of the above.  You just mentioned, yes, they are doing all of those things.  Here's the thing, again.  There had to be warning signs with this guy.  Someone, and we'll find this out later on today  as this case progresses,  someone knows about this guy,  whether or not he has family members,  whether or not he had a girlfriend.  Who knows?  But somebody had to have known  that this guy was planning this type of an attack. 
[00:34:30]  And maybe he has a criminal history.  We do not know that quite yet.  Again, this is so fluid right now.  We're going to find all of these answers out.  He's just saying words.  Words, words, words.  This man may be an airline pilot,  and he may enjoy Yankees baseball.  Oh, yeah, well, you could fucking say maybe anything.  In a situation like this that we just think,  what you have to do is scatter.  You don't want to gather as a group.  And I think that's why that guy set that bomb off,  because he wanted people to be huddled up as a group, 
[00:35:00]  heading for the door,  because it made it easier for him to take out his targets.  So in a shooting situation like this,  this is some good information, guys.  You always want to scatter.  Get away from everybody.  Can I point out,  you're in a movie theater  where smoke canisters are set off?  There's not 500 exits.  You know the area very well yourself.  There's two.  Two exits.  One the shooter's next to,  and the other one.  And also, reports coming in  that a gang unit came on the scene, 
[00:35:30]  canines, FBI.  Maybe it was a dog then.  Everyone showed up.  Yeah, you've got to imagine  everyone's going to show up.  Everyone showed up.  Except for the poor guy  that has to do the domestic violence.  Yeah, except for that poor guy.  Domestic violence.  She has not shut up  about taking the garbage out.  Sir, you don't understand.  There's been a shooting.  I can't do this.  I didn't shoot her.  What are you talking about?  She shot her mouth off.  Yes.  You think he's distracted?  He's like,  oh God, I want to get back to the scene.  Because I imagine  if you're a police officer,  this is the type of thing 
[00:36:00]  you want to be involved with.  And he's just fucking...  And he's like,  she just won't shut the fuck up.  Sir, sir,  can I ask you to sit down?  Sit down.  He's got a fucking beer in his hand.  Right.  That guy.  That guy.  This cop's like,  oh really?  I've got to leave this scene?  Mm-hmm.  Oh God.  That's fucking horrible, man.  Terrible.  Terrible.  We just seem to have  one of these every, what?  Every so often.  Every other year, 
[00:36:30]  it seems like.  It's, you know,  basic human nature.  Yep.  I reckon.  But just like,  what a selfish cunt this guy is.  Knowing that,  besides the people he's killing,  just the amount of people  he wants to be tied in  with this movie.  Yes.  He wants to be tied in  negatively with it.  Yeah.  Piece of garbage.  Mm-hmm.  Engine 3,  I forgot to ask,  did you want them  to merge into a routine?  Huh?  Routine, sir.  Copy, thanks. 
[00:37:00]  Oh yeah.  That happened?  Then what happened?  What happened?  Wampa.  I always wonder  what's happening.  I have a witness over here  at Crystal in Alameda  that was told  to come be interviewed  by Fox News.  Are we letting them in?  Hey, Jake,  one more time.  I have someone here  that was told  by Fox News  to come in  and be interviewed.  Are we letting them  back in or no?  Absolutely not. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, nobody,  once they've left,  no, we don't need  anybody else in here.  Ah.  Copy that.  Fox News  is all pissed off now.  Yeah, they're screwed.  They lost, fucker.  Hey, CSI dispatch,  want to make her 34?  Fucker 34.  Can you see if  we can have everyone  on the east side  of Dillard's?  We have a vehicle  made in the car.  Truck 2 with Battalion 1  with Engine 3  on a standby.  Mapgrid 4, David 2,  East 17th Avenue,  North Oswego Street.  Truck 2 with Battalion 1  on a standby with APD. 
[00:38:00]  Mapgrid 4, David 2,  17th and Oswego.  Respond on Tech 2.  I need Tech 2.  God, it's so enraging.  I need to go to Tech 2.  It really is, huh?  Yeah, you can go ahead  and give them my cell.  Don't give back your number.  Sir, is there somewhere  I would find that number?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you should have it  up at Dillpatch  at Chief 3  or Martinoi.  Yeah.  They would never give it out  on a police scanner, right?  Oh. 
[00:38:30]  They've got to be aware  people are  monitoring the situation.  Of course.  We're monitoring  the situation.  Megia.  Megia.  Yeah, this is a...  I've got 622, 624, 625.  I'm bashing MSNBC on Twitter  and somebody goes,  should they spend hours  on this story?  Yes!  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they're there for.  It's unfolding right now. 
[00:39:00]  That's why you have  a 24-hour news chat.  Right.  You're done.  Yeah, kind of.  You do.  You spend the next few hours on it.  It's not like it's either this  or another shooting  or a presidential assassination.  Yeah, yeah.  It's this or fucking  the Emmy nominations.  They're just not prepared.  When we get home today,  this is going to be  all you're going to see  all day long.  They're just not prepared.  That's exactly it.  And yes, they should.  Yes, they should.  If you know anything  about building an audience,  you realize people are going  to search out this news  on their own. 
[00:39:30]  Because all that other stuff  could wait.  I don't give a fuck  who's nominated  for an Emmy right now.  It's such...  And how is Morning Joe  as a host not going?  I mean, this is...  No, forget it.  This is terrible.  Yeah.  I know there's not much  new info,  but how do you concentrate  on the Emmys?  Right.  A guy fighting  with his girlfriend.  Still?  We went back to that.  I wasn't listening.  Yeah, apparently.  Jesus Christ.  This is just logistics. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's still interesting, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And things like that  there at the Century 16 Multiplex.  What kind of security  was in place 
[00:40:30]  before the movie started?  Did you see police officers there?  Before I went into the theater?  Yeah.  No, I actually didn't see a lot.  I was actually surprised  because of the amount of people  that were going to be there.  And I thought they would have  had more enforcement.  Why?  Right.  And we understand  that the movie was showing  at three different screens  there in Aurora.  Were they all  filled to capacity?  Of course! 
[00:41:00]  It's Batman!  Jesus.  And I couldn't get  a ticket to the first two.  And then I had to settle  for the third one.  That was the only one  that was still selling tickets.  Well, you know what?  You're lucky  you weren't in that earlier theater.  Yeah.  I think you noticed that.  A lot of excitement around.  It just frustrates me,  the basic shit.  Like, as a news guy,  you don't know that  the Batman movie  and the Midnight Showings  are all sold out  across America.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Supposedly it's sold out  for the entire weekend.  Of course all the theaters  were packed. 
[00:41:30]  And then somebody writes,  MSNBC should be politicizing  this tragedy  like real Americans.  Are you guys out there,  like, are people  who like MSNBC's politics  this fucking delusional?  They're doing a lousy job.  Terrible.  Now they're covering it.  They keep going in.  But they're getting  their fucking commercials in.  And then the host  and his co-host  are talking about  Emmy nominations  and political ends.  Emmy nominations  and, yeah,  and Romney fucking  Bain Capital.  They're covering the garbage 
[00:42:00]  they planned on covering.  Yeah.  They're a live news network  and they're not going  with the live news.  Right.  We had a whole show planned  and we threw it all  out the fucking window  right now.  We on this show.  And we're just a,  we're supposedly  just a dumb shock jock show.  Yes.  And we,  yes, we are.  No, I don't think so.  I like to think  we're way better  than most of these  fucking idiots  at this point.  We're having fun.  No, we like to go dumb.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we do  one day through five  eight, we do it.  This is Denver,  but I don't think  it's, you know,  Detail 3 has been released. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not sure  what they'll have  on it.  We can be in  all around  and hold it  at the end  of the remainder.  Hello.  Nothing.  No.  I don't think so.  What's that English  guy doing?  I don't know.  What's he doing there?  I don't know.  I don't like that.  They sent in  the bobbies.  Hello.  I don't think 
[00:43:00]  Denver's going to  have anything.  All right.  It's not going  on in Denver.  Just horrible.  Yeah, it's really  depressing.  Fucking horrible.  And if you're in  if you are there  in the theater  with your gun,  do you shoot?  Yes.  I say yeah.  It all depends.  You know,  it's one of those  situations you can  never say what  you would do  in that situation.  It's a fucking  like battle situation.  Wouldn't you try  to get your ass  out of there  like anyone else? 
[00:43:30]  Maybe.  I think if you  got somebody  that's well trained.  But you would  assess the situation  like, wait,  maybe if I get  behind this pillar  or I don't know.  Yeah.  But your first  thought is to  save yourself.  That's what  everyone would say.  Any reasonable  guy with a gun,  the first thing  you think of  is, is this  the right thing  to do?  Is this something?  Is this a stunt?  You know,  you don't want  to shoot someone  that's pulling  a stunt  for the movie  kind of a thing. 
[00:44:00]  So, you know,  to just instantly  start firing  in a crowded theater,  you know,  you get yourself  fucked that way.  But then,  and then,  how do you know  even though people  are screaming,  it might be a prank?  It might, you know,  it's one of those  situations where  it might be  Howie Mandel  doing, you know,  a scene for Mobbed  or something.  Something like that.  Some over the top  prank, you're right.  Yeah, but if you're  So you gotta wait  it out a little bit  and then go,  holy fuck,  this is real.  But if you're close  to the situation  and you see 
[00:44:30]  somebody fall  and bleeding  and now you know  that this is happening  and it's a real  thing going down,  then, yeah,  you fucking  would have to,  you know.  But your brain says  get the fuck  out of this theater  first.  Yeah, yeah.  It really does,  unfortunately.  That would be  your instinct.  But then if you're  thinking, wait a minute,  I could, you know,  he's distracted right now,  I think I could  take a shot,  then you take a shot.  If you're a cop,  you probably take a shot  because you understand  immediately what's happening,  like an off-duty cop. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But for a regular guy,  it's like,  you're gonna have to wait.  Yeah, it's a tough call.  You're gonna have to wait  at first.  Yeah.  Well, yeah,  cover and then  fucking return fire.  What was footage  of the old man recently?  There was an old guy  that was a robbery  and he was with his wife  and he fucking had a gun  and he ran after the guy  and popped and  fucking chased him out.  He's sitting in a chair  at the back  of this internet cafe.  Two guys come in  with masks on.  One guy's got a gun,  one guy's got a baseball bat.  They start rousting the crowd.  This old guy  just stands up,  pulls his gun out  and starts shooting  at these motherfuckers  who absolutely 
[00:45:30]  were not expecting it  because they were  tripping over each other  to get out the door  and the old guy's  just plugging them.  Man.  Did he actually shoot them?  Yeah.  He got both of them.  Didn't kill them.  They wound up in the hospital  and then they got arrested.  But yeah,  they were,  boy were they shocked.  Oh, were they shocked.  Denver University Hospital  is reporting  that they are treating  three people  for chemical exposure  but that could just be  the tear gas.  They were probably  close to the tear gas.  Investigating in the hospitals  and finding out  why this took place  and whether there is 
[00:46:00]  anyone involved  in bringing this together.  That's right.  We're going to have  some more experts  coming on.  Experts.  Tell us what they think  went on.  If you've got a question,  email us,  friends at foxnews.com.  Now, top stories,  MSNBC.  Defense Department  Service members  made this march  in uniform at Gates  and former director  of the White House  Domestic Policy Council  and CEO of Melanie Barnes  Solutions,  Melody Barnes.  Good to have you  all on board this hour. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you.  We want to go straight  to Willie Geis, though,  for an update  on the terrible situation  out of Aurora, Colorado.  Willie.  Yeah, and NBC's  Pete Williams  confirming the suspected  shooter in today's massacre  in Aurora, Colorado  is a 24-year-old man.  A white male, police say.  Fifteen people are dead right now.  They say white.  Fifteen more wounded.  They got to say white male.  They do, but I want  a suspect description,  so fair enough.  Outside Denver,  the suspect is in custody  right now.  If you're just middle-eachers,  they'd probably say it here,  though.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  It was the opening night  of this Dark Knight Rises movie.  Crazy white guy.  They were in costume,  so he didn't,  wasn't much of a,  he didn't stand out.  He was wearing black  and he wore a gas mask,  but then walked  to the front of the theater,  apparently dropped  some kind of canister,  police say.  Some kind of smoke  began to rise,  and then he just began  opening fire indiscriminately,  killing now at least  15 people.  The police chief there  in Aurora calls it  a horrific scene.  Images of police  dragging people  and perhaps bodies  out of the movie theaters. 
[00:47:30]  Somebody says now  have to go through security  to go to a movie theater.  after they received the call  at 1239 local time.  Just for that reason,  like so I want  to all countries  not to fucking ship gears.  20 minutes into the movie,  this guy walked in  and began opening fire.  That suspect is in custody,  a 24-year-old white male.  He was carrying  a couple of weapons,  a knife.  But it is funny  how they now,  maybe it's fair.  So they shut down  and locked down  that movie theater  as they checked.  They're quick to point out  they haven't found that yet.  Jim Miklishevsky  at the Pentagon  reporting defense officials  say they have no indication  as a white guy, though. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, much more  than a fucking man.  I'm going to fucking  make a statement  just after midnight time.  He thinks he's the Dark Knight.  I'm the Dark Knight.  Selfish cunt.  Goddamn fucking prick.  Just a selfish  little nothing.  24-year-old,  probably good at nothing,  probably got dumped.  You know,  just a fucking bag of shit  who would never have  amounted to anything  who wants to get famous. 
[00:48:30]  And now he's going to be  very, very famous.  And he wanted to live, man.  I'm telling you.  You had the bulletproof vest  and he still had  a fucking bomb in the car  which means he was probably  going around the fucking  front to do something else.  And they will pick apart  everything this guy has done.  Music he's listened to,  television,  video games he's played.  Everything is going to be,  well, look at what caused this.  And meanwhile,  what caused it is  this guy's a fucking prick.  Just a dick.  Let's see what CNN's doing.  As we understand it, 
[00:49:00]  the vehicle was found  with some sort of  explosive device in it.  Now, it could be  a gas canister  or something of the sort.  At this point,  we are just not sure.  There is a picture  of his vehicle right there.  Now, here is what  we are hearing from witnesses  that this gunman  entered the movie theater.  The movie started  about midnight,  but just after 1230,  apparently this gunman  stood up in the front  of the movie theater,  set off some sort  of gas canister.  That's what witnesses  are telling us.  And then grabbed a rifle  and at least,  and two handguns 
[00:49:30]  and started shooting  at random.  We are hearing  that somewhere between  10 and 20 shots  went out across  that movie theater.  There was mass chaos  in that movie theater.  The gunman then ran out  to the back of the theater  to the parking lot  and that is where  his car was parked.  Now, think about it.  The folks who are going  to a movie at 1230,  12 o'clock midnight,  there's going to be  a lot of teenagers.  And there are parents  waking up this morning  whose teenagers  may not have returned home.  There are as many  as 50 people  in the hospital 
[00:50:00]  this morning.  Some are being treated  with more moderate injuries,  but some are considered  to be severe  at this point.  14 people dead  at this hour.  They can't get this straight?  What we are hearing  from what went as he's  a 30-year-old  Benjamin Fernandez  and he says  that he was watching  the movie  and that's when he heard  a series of explosions.  He said that people  ran from that theater.  There were gunshots.  Police then shouting,  get down,  get down.  This witness says  that he saw people  falling,  including one young girl  and we are hearing  that a child  as young as one, 
[00:50:30]  possibly two years old,  may have been shot  at point-blank range.  The police  setting up a command post  near the Dillard's  department store,  which is nearby.  They're now interviewing  hundreds of possible witnesses.  Some of those witnesses  were taken by buses  to Gateway High School  for additional questioning.  The police spokeswoman  says the scene  is still, quote,  very active.  Again, we are hearing  at least 14 people  dead at this hour,  many of them  children and teenagers.  Another 50 have been injured,  many of them  in critical condition  in nearby hospitals. 
[00:51:00]  Police are asking  for anyone  with any information  about this shooting  to please call  303-627-3100.  And guys,  it's also important  to point out  that this movie  was sold out.  And so, fortunately,  there were police  at the scene  when all of this  went down.  And that is because  they were there  primarily for crowd control.  So thank goodness  that those law enforcement  officials were there  because this could have  been much worse.  As terrible as it sounds,  it could have been  much worse.  So let's keep that  in perspective 
[00:51:30]  and we'll keep coming  to you with more information  as we get it, guys.  All right, Heather.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Heather.  Joining us now  is Jamie Marshall.  She was in the theater  adjacent to where  the shooting occurred.  Good morning, Jamie.  Morning.  Jamie, what did you see  in this terrible,  terrible event?  I'm sorry,  what did you say?  What did you see  last night  in this terrible,  terrible event?  Well, we were watching  the movie,  and it was about 20 minutes  in, I'd say,  and it was in the middle  of a shooting scene.  And in our theater, 
[00:52:00]  we heard all of a sudden  this sounds like  as if someone  set off firecrackers.  And we all start  looking around,  and people in the section  closest to this wall  where we heard it from  kind of all looked around,  and then it happened again,  and a bunch of them  jumped off  and started running,  getting out of the theater.  They seemed really confused,  and so we didn't know  what was going on.  We thought someone  was just pranking  us in the movie.  So we started looking around.  We didn't know what to do.  There was panic,  and then one guy  ran through to the theater,  the personal theater's exit, 
[00:52:30]  their emergency exit.  He said,  don't go out through the lobby,  someone's shooting.  So we didn't know what to do.  We didn't know if people  were just trying  to cause a panic or what.  So we started exiting.  People started running  up the stairs  because of an exit  to a balcony area upstairs.  And we went up  to the left side of the theater  where we heard the sound,  and we looked at the wall,  and it seemed as if  bullet holes had come through  from the other theater.  Wow.  And then we heard a big boom,  so we started running  and got up the stairs,  and police started  bringing people down 
[00:53:00]  the stairs from that balcony  and running them out  to the lobby,  and we saw a kid  run out the door  that was shot,  and then a girl outside  who had been shot  in the leg,  and people covered in blood.  Well, Jamie,  you did what you're  supposed to do.  We spoke earlier  with Rod Wheeler,  a homicide investigator,  and he said  that's exactly what  you're supposed to do  is scatter and go...  Obviously a dummy,  but there's no room  to scatter in a theater.  This didn't happen  in a football field,  and they all curled up  on the fucking 10-yard line.  It's a fucking movie theater.  Jesus.  Real Phil Hendry  on Twitter, radio guy. 
[00:53:30]  One of the few radio guys  I really like.  He's tweeting  some good stuff right now.  He writes,  guys,  a 24-year-old  all-black costume  bulletproof vest.  I'll bet his motive  will be revenge  against a puny world  not worthy of his genius.  Uh-huh.  That's what it is.  And then some asshole  had to do their  Baba Booey today.  That's coming in.  That's wonderful.  Good for you.  I'm sure Howard  will be very proud.  What year is this?  Enjoy.  Enjoy your fucking...  Whatever. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, he's gonna be famous.  We're gonna know...  You know, he's unknown right now.  But this guy is gonna be  the most known fucking guy  in the country  in a matter of hours.  Everyone will know  this guy's name.  Everyone will know  his dumb fucking opinions,  ideology, beliefs,  and how fucking amazing  and misunderstood he was  and all this horse shit. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, God.  On Twitter, another guy says,  although this is a tabloid story,  okay, I agree,  they are a terrible network,  meaning MSNBC,  just like Fox News and CNN.  They all suck.  It is amazing how fast  MSNBC fans are politicizing  what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'm not...  Who cares about Fox's  political slant?  No.  The way they're covering  a live news story.  Yeah.  Why can't you be honest  with yourself?  If you like MSNBC,  good for you,  but they're failing right now.  We got all three on,  the main three cable news networks, 
[00:55:00]  and MSNBC is talking about...  Syria unrest.  Yeah, which we could deal with  tomorrow or Sunday.  This is a massive story  that's breaking now.  Fox hasn't gone to a commercial yet,  and CNN hasn't gone to a commercial.  They're failing as a news network.  These fucking babies  that like MSNBC,  all they can do...  And Fox!  Fox!  Fox is covering...  Look!  It just happened!  Right.  News is coming out,  and it's not a tabloid story.  No.  This is not fucking  a Brangelina.  What the fuck? 
[00:55:30]  It's a shooting.  It's a legit story.  It's one of the main problems  we have in this country.  Everyone has to put  their stupid political blinders  on all the fucking time.  Sometimes you just gotta be honest  and realize, look...  ... expansion and a proliferation...  Those are the chemical weapons  that Saddam Hussein moved over the Syrian border.  I mean, I understand that.  Of course.  The United States went in, right?  It's like we conservatives  were saying for at least six months...  This is why they fucking...  And so...  We're gonna...  She left the instructor, Graves, 
[00:56:00]  or something,  because she seemed to be...  Fox,  and you got CNN.  There goes Piers.  Horrendous details  from the Colorado Cinema shooting.  America has to do something  about its gun laws.  Now is the time.  Would you honestly think  that Piers Morgan...  So that's what the first...  You honestly think gun laws  have anything to do with this?  Honestly.  Or maybe you'd remember  that somebody else  will go out  and start the same type  of thing somewhere else.  So that's number one.  Secondly...  There's plenty of gun laws  in place. 
[00:56:30]  Unfortunately,  there are people  that don't pay attention  to laws.  You know there's laws  against bank robbery?  Oh, really?  You know there's laws  against it,  but people somehow  still do it.  Yeah, that's just  dumbing down  a very difficult  and complicated  topic.  Don't worry about it.  Piers.  That'll make Coups go,  oh, okay.  You know there's gun laws  all over in fucking Chicago  and people are shot  on a daily fucking  hourly basis  in Chicago. 
[00:57:00]  Initially we'll be looking  at the domestic terrorism issue.  There had been some reports  in fact that the vehicle,  and we saw pictures  of a white car  that we believed  to have been the car  of the shooter  because the doors  were open,  the trunk was up,  it was being searched,  that the vehicle  had plates from Tennessee.  So crossing state lines  clearly would be  another issue  that would involve  the FBI.  Well, certainly.  They'll be looking  into where he lived  in Tennessee  or who, you know,  various neighbors  or family members 
[00:57:30]  that may be  still in another state  such as Tennessee.  So that's one issue.  The issue of  bomb squad capability  will be another issue  to examine that vehicle.  You know,  you do got to kind of  find some comedy  just because it's  just horrific.  This guy,  E. John X,  writes,  I bet Fred Willard  is a little relieved  this morning.  Oh, man, right?  These fucking news shows  were going to be  all about Fred Willard  getting caught  supposedly,  allegedly jacking off  in an adult movie theater. 
[00:58:00]  Man, did he fucking skate?  Holy shit,  you're right.  Fred Willard  was jacking off  in a fucking  porno theater  which would have been  all over the news today.  Or at least  all over the internet.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Even the news  would have said it.  No one.  Fred Willard,  congratulations.  You're skating today, sir.  Oh, no,  this detail just in.  He's not skating.  Gunman is Fred Willard.  Holy shit.  He wants,  he wanted to get  the heat off of him. 
[00:58:30]  Ejohn X on Twitter,  bravo.  You're right, though.  That is exactly.  You are right.  Fred Willard.  For the most part,  a fairly nice  livable suburb  that you'd want  to raise your kids in.  Yeah.  What do you need  to tell us,  Kelly,  what do you need  to tell us  about what happened  last night?  You know,  it's just a shock.  It's sad to see  that this sort of thing  happens here,  but anywhere.  It's sad for the victims,  of course,  it's also sad 
[00:59:00]  for the entire community.  How much you want  to bet because,  you know,  humans do suck  that there's someone  right now  demanding their money back.  They skated,  they didn't get,  yeah.  I didn't see  the entire movie.  Right.  What's the refund policy?  Yeah.  Wow.  Will that affect,  I mean,  again,  the movie itself  is unimportant  compared to this,  but it's a huge event  happening all over the country  for the entire weekend.  There's a lot.  So how does it affect that?  They're going to see  stepped up security.  Yeah.  They're going to do. 
[00:59:30]  They're going to step up  security for this movie now.  Certainly New York,  you'll see NYPD  outside these theaters.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Talk for New York,  that's about it.  That's about it.  Jesus.  It's like,  what a scumbag  shoots a baby.  Like,  what a fuck?  I mean,  shooting adults  is bad enough,  but...  It's crazy.  This guy's a fucking  piece of shite.  Just a fucking  selfish...  Selfish,  exactly.  Me, me,  look at me. 
[01:00:00]  Little cunt of a man.  Oh,  man.  Unbelievable.  Video of inside theater  after shooting people  running out  covered in blood.  Everyone's throwing  their videos up now  on YouTube.  That must have just  looked like fucking  a war zone,  definitely.  Like,  but there's...  Now,  it's conflicting reports.  Was he in the theater  waiting,  watching the movie,  or did he kick 
[01:00:30]  the door in?  Now,  because how the fuck  do you get in the theater  with a rifle?  I think he probably  kicked the door in.  A gun planted,  I don't know about that.  That's fucking weird.  Maybe,  but again,  if there's a gun planted,  obviously,  he either worked there  or he's a maintenance guy  or he did something  where he had theater access.  Yeah.  Or he just went to  that theater  for another movie  and taped a gun somewhere  that he knew  they wouldn't find right away.  You know?  But if he kicked the door in  during a shooting scene,  that means he knew 
[01:01:00]  when the shooting scene  was happening in the movie,  but he wouldn't need  the shooting scene  to do what he had to do.  Yeah.  Everyone's focused  on the movie.  Half hour in,  you're really settled.  You're settled in  and your eyes  are just on that fucking screen.  Hmm.  Unless he had to do it  during the shooting scene  and there was something  about that too for him.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That sounds coincidental.  I think it might be  a coincidence though, right?  Yeah.  It's an action movie.  Damn. 
[01:01:30]  People are just tuning in.  Well, I mean,  and they want to know  what's going on.  Well, there's a midnight  showing of The Batman  in Aurora, Colorado  and half hour into the movie,  a gunman starts shooting.  Yeah.  Let off some,  looks like tear gas  and so far 15 people are dead  and at least 50 injured,  I guess.  Yeah.  That's for the people  that don't know still.  Hmm. 
[01:02:00]  Well, you wouldn't know  if you were on MSNBC.  But in fact,  it's a collective success  of the whole society  that somehow builds  enterprises like this.  Comment back there.  So why don't you  now ask a leading question  to Mark Halpern  while I sit here  and roll my eyes?  What is MSNBC  trying to prove here?  I don't understand.  I don't know.  I do think the news  gets a bit tabloid-ish.  Sure.  But this is a story  that just happened.  It's breaking.  Maybe you move on  after a little while,  but to just completely 
[01:02:30]  ignore it like they're doing,  I don't understand.  They're terrible.  Let's Fox have  Michael Bodden on for that.  He was able  to put his hand  on the revolver  and insert his thumb  in such a way  that the weapon  didn't fire.  That's right.  A real hero guy.  Right.  And what's diabolical  about this particular  situation, Doctor,  is the fact that  it sounds like  what we're learning  initially is  the guy was down  in the front.  You've got a theater  with hundreds of people  in there.  The guy's down  at the front.  He stands up,  turns around.  He's got three guns, 
[01:03:00]  two handguns  and a long gun.  But the only way out  is past him.  And the people  might have thought,  people would have thought  that's part of the show.  You know,  with all the hype,  that would be  very confusing initially.  You get a guy  stand up,  start shooting.  Is this part of the show  or not?  And so people  would hesitate.  But the only other  kind of thing is  That's why I don't think  it's a coincidence  he started doing it  during the shooting.  That's why.  Because if he timed it  for the shooting,  either he was waiting,  but if he kicked the door  in, you've got to know  when that's happening. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe that was part  of his sick mind.  People just don't know  when things are  happening around him.  And by the time  you assess a situation  like that,  a lot of damage  has already been done.  Here's the white car again.  Surprised him  or how it actually happened.  But I know some  of the first officers  that arrived within,  I don't know  if it was seconds,  maximum a couple minutes,  found him behind  the theater at his car  and took him  into custody there.  Jeez.  So that is a little  description from some 
[01:04:00]  of the eyewitnesses  of what they saw  inside that theater,  which is really  a theater complex.  16 theaters,  many of them  showing The Dark Knight  Rising,  which of course  was packed  because this has been  a film that people  have been anxiously  awaiting.  Here's what we know  about the shooter.  His name has not been  released by authorities  at this point,  but he's described  as 24 years old.  He's also described  as wearing a bulletproof  vest and being heavily  armed.  He was taken into custody,  we're told,  in the rear parking lot  of the theater,  although some  of my witnesses  said in fact  they thought that 
[01:04:30]  he was captured  in the theater itself.  The police say  they took a shotgun  and a rifle from him.  They were able  to recover another gun  inside the theater  and he was,  according to some witnesses,  wearing goggles.  Police confirmed  that he had a gas mask  as well.  They have not confirmed  the goggles part.  Police say he did not  put up a fight.  There was no resistance  and additionally  he was able  to tell them  about explosives  in his apartment building.  Police said that  at a press conference  and after that  they mobilized units 
[01:05:00]  to his apartment building  and there is a building  that we've been monitoring  that appears could be his  where it's now been surrounded  and surrounded by law enforcement  and ambulances as well.  It does not believe,  no one believes  that there was a second shooter,  although in their early morning  press conference police  said that that was something  that they would continue  to actively monitor.  50 people were transported  to area hospitals  with injuries.  Some of those injuries  very grave.  I want to get to Nicole Williams.  She's joining us by phone  from Swedish Medical Center. 
[01:05:30]  She's an assistant  vice president there.  Nicole, thanks for your time.  Appreciate it.  Tell me what's happening  at your medical center right now.  Right now we have actually  just received a word  that we are receiving  a fourth patient.  So currently we have  a 19-year-old male  who has been listed  in fair condition.  We have a 20-year-old  male who is in critical,  a 29-year-old female  in critical,  and we understand  we have a 19-year-old  female inbound.  We are unclear  of her condition  at this time.  So you have two 
[01:06:00]  in critical condition.  You have one 19-year-old  who seems that that person  is in better condition  and you're unclear  of the person  who's being transported  to you at this time.  Correct.  Can you give me  any details on those  who are reported  in critical condition?  What kind of injuries  do they have?  Gunshot wounds.  The three that we received  immediately following  the incident  all came in  with gunshot wounds.  We're hearing rumors  that the patient  that's currently  on their way in  could have some  shrapnel wounds.  But again,  I don't believe  they've arrived yet. 
[01:06:30]  We have not been  able to assess.  We should take a break.  We'll continue with this.  Selfish scumbag  this guy is, man.  We've got two things  to do today.  Continue with this  and make sure  that Fred Willard  doesn't slide.  Yes.  For his naughty,  naughty beauty.  Fred Willard's  a very naughty old man.  I teased him  on Twitter last night.  I mean,  I like Fred Willard.  And I realized  he was following me.  Oh, no.  Oh, he was following you.  Oh.  I said he denied 
[01:07:00]  masturbating in the theater.  He was just punching  his cock for talking  during the movie.  There you go.  And I looked him up  and I was like,  oh, boy.  Poor Fred Willard.  He's 72.  The fuck?  What undercover cop  is doing that?  Leave him alone.  How embarrassing.  Yeah, what a detail.  You really need to go  into seedy adult theaters  and bust people  for jacking off?  That's kind of strange.  Seems like there's  a lot of other things  to worry about before that.  And what do you,  if you're in an adult theater 
[01:07:30]  watching fucking porn,  you know,  your first thought is  maybe I got to get rid  of some of this poison.  Yeah.  But who called the police?  Is there like  a new manager there  who didn't know?  Hey, let's go out of here!  Holy shit.  Well, I didn't expect this.  This wasn't in my job detail.  I actually might see  guys jerking off in here.  What the fuck?  Fuck that.  It's an adult theater.  Yeah.  That's what people do  in adult theaters. 
[01:08:00]  A seedy.  I mean, it's in a seedy  part of town and everything, man.  Lots of reports said  he was in the movie already,  stood up for the first time  Batman came on screen.  Is this Fred Willard?  Yeah.  Oh.  No, he, uh,  I don't know.  He shot in the theater too.  I resisted that one.  Oh, did you?  Okay, thanks.  No, no, no.  On Twitter.  Thanks for leaving it for me.  No, I know.  No, that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Jiminy Cricket. 
[01:08:30]  And then someone says,  can it be argued that MSNBC  shouldn't cover because others are?  No.  You're not supposed to think,  if you're a 24-hour news network,  you're not supposed to think  of the competition.  You should just,  as a responsible news network,  it's a real story.  This is not a tabloid,  hunk of shit.  It's not voyeurism  when it's actually  an unfolding story.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean,  if you're running  a news organization,  technically,  they're not really,  you know,  pure news organizations.  Aren't they or no? 
[01:09:00]  I don't think so.  They're all slanted and shit.  I think,  I think you want ratings.  Yeah.  And I think,  you know,  you think about ratings  big time  and to not cover the story,  you're,  it's just stupid  on MSNBC's part.  Yeah.  Completely stupid.  I guarantee their numbers  are dropping drastically  this morning  because they're not  doing a lot on it.  They're doing a little bit  on it right now.  A little bit.  Well, they're showing  the president's Obama's  statement on it,  of course. 
[01:09:30]  Which again,  I guess that is news.  Yeah, that's fine.  But then they'll move  on to other shit.  I mean,  you know,  Fox and CNN,  I'm not playing favorites here,  trust me.  They still haven't gone  to commercial.  It's just around the,  you know,  around the clock coverage.  Before opening fire,  he is now in police custody.  The president of the United States  who is traveling  to Florida right now  overnighting in Palm Beach  this morning  was notified  of the shooting  by Homeland Security  Advisor John Brennan  at 526 a.m. Eastern  this morning.  He then released  this president.  The president says, 
[01:10:00]  Michelle and I are shocked  and saddened  by the horrific  and tragic shooting  in Colorado.  Federal and local  law enforcement  are still responding  and my administration  will do everything  that we can  to support the people  of Aurora  in this extraordinarily  difficult time.  We are committed  to bringing  whomever  was responsible  to justice,  ensuring the safety  of our people  and caring for those  who have been wounded.  Statements just suck.  Yeah.  That's just insincere.  It's just so dumb.  Of course all that's 
[01:10:30]  going to happen.  Yes.  Of course.  This is dumb.  No one can speak  from the heart.  No.  I'm sure he had to  go over with his people.  All right.  Well, let's be careful  about this statement.  Make sure everything  is perfect.  Yes.  Word it properly.  Let's not say anything.  Here's the first draft.  Well, I don't know.  Let's rewrite this a little bit.  Let's change this word  a little bit.  That sounds a little rash.  We don't want to alarm people.  I hate statements.  Statements.  That's terrible.  Stink.  You know what people  are pointing out though  which is a good point  and one of you guys  might have said this  that the fucking 
[01:11:00]  fire doors open out.  You can't kick them  in from the outside.  They open outward  so obviously it couldn't  have been kicked in  unless somebody had  propped it open  or they stood up  in the theater  and kicked it to leave.  That's true.  Maybe they kicked it  open to leave.  I'm guessing  that it's a theater employee  or someone who has  access to that theater.  I could be completely  obviously wrong but  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Now they're outside  his apartment.  Oh, that's his apartment.  Oh, wow.  Let's see what this  is all about.  Indication that the  individual involved  was driving a car 
[01:11:30]  with Tennessee plates  and so anything  that needs to be  conducted,  any investigation  out of state  that can be conducted  for the Aurora PD  will be done  in an expeditious  manner by the Bureau.  The Bureau will put  any expertise  that they may request  will guarantee  that they'll  have that assistance.  In terms of  the other thing  they have to do  is probably  working together  with ATF  looking at the origin  of the weapons  and where that gas  is a mitigation 
[01:12:00]  now that perhaps  tear gas can  has gone off  so this individual  had access  to arms,  to ammunition,  to other  sources of chaos.  So it's  a confusing issue  right now  which will be  kind of ironed up  but what can we do  to protect there  is it's a terrible  situation,  you know,  and we can't  walk down the country.  You can have  some indicators,  you can look at  the way people are  but you know,  when you have a movie 
[01:12:30]  like this  with such hype  with Batman,  you know,  people do things.  They come to movies  in costume  and stuff like that  so you don't really know  who these people are  and I mean,  that may be one thing.  I guarantee  that's going to stop.  Oh boy.  They can at least,  you know,  control that a little bit.  We're a very knee-jerky country.  I guarantee  you're not going to be  able to wear a costume  or a mask  into a movie theater  anymore.  Yep.  You know,  a lot of people  have had fun  with that over the years  but that'll be  the first thing  that stops. 
[01:13:00]  Jeez.  I'm not going to be  kind of attack.  The determination  should be made  very quickly  whether or not  this was a lone gunman  who potentially  is mentally disturbed  or whether or not  he belongs  to a larger group.  Loner.  Tony Roman.  I agree.  I'm sorry.  Keep going, Tony.  I'm going loner.  Selfish cocksucker.  Put up,  didn't resist,  didn't shoot himself  in the head  so he probably wants  to be caught and heard.  He's the Dark Knight.  That's what this guy is. 
[01:13:30]  If he stood up  when Batman came on screen  this little fucking cunt  is just one of those  loner piece of shit  that nobody liked  because he has  nothing to offer.  He should have just  shot himself in the head.  He didn't have  the moral courage  to do that.  So he's the Dark Knight.  He probably thinks  he relates to Batman  rising and  what a fucking twerp.  I think he thinks  he's the villain there.  Well, yeah, but you know, 
[01:14:00]  if he stood up  when Batman came out  he's just a twerp.  We'll see.  Just a fucking twerp.  Ugh.  God.  And this MSM,  again, I know  it's a business  but the fact that  they're showing  these commercials,  can you guys  just cover  the fucking story?  Yeah.  And again,  I hate when news stories  overdo,  like news networks  overdo the coverage  because it becomes  a point where you're  just like a fucking shill.  But it really is.  It's unfolding  and new footage  is coming out  every fucking two minutes. 
[01:14:30]  It really,  it's one of those things  where it's legit.  Right.  It's really fresh.  MSNBC is just doing  a quick headline about it.  And CNN and Fox  are both doing it.  It's not about politics,  you dumbbells.  No.  It's CNN and Fox  are both doing the right thing.  And we usually don't watch them  but I'm sure the Today Show  and all that  is pretty much around the  You'd hope so, yeah.  Around the hour coverage  or whatever.  I would imagine.  You know how many comedians  right now are being  canceled across the country  on these morning news shows?  Oh, yeah.  Like they have like  their local gigs to plug  because it's a Friday  and that's the day  you do them.  Right.  They're all getting bummed. 
[01:15:00]  Yep.  Not that it matters  but that's what's happening.  Of course.  In the comic world.  Yeah.  Yes.  But Ann Romney,  we've given you people  all you need to know.  They're focusing on that  right at this moment.  Yep.  It sure is a story  but it could wait.  Yeah.  Ann Romney.  Could wait.  Please.  All that shit could wait.  Jesus.  I'm going to take a break  and we'll continue  with this stuff.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Maybe listen to the  Police Scanner a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  That Police Scanner stuff  is really...  I could listen to that  all morning.  I listen to it at night. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  It's amazing.  Wow.  That was like me  playing porn right now  and playing that fucking...  Ooh, ooh, what's going on?  People are telling me  my headshot was in  Louie last night.  I didn't see it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But that's the entrance  to the...  I saw the photo  but I didn't see the episode.  I mean, that's the entrance  to the comedy cellar.  That's when you walk  into the cellar.  Yeah, they're talking.  Louie's talking with somebody  and right in between them.  Bamford.  Yeah.  Oh, is that Maria Bamford?  Yeah, I saw that episode  and they're having a moment  and you're right in the middle  of them, your headshot.  And Geraldo's is right above me.  I saw the photo.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:16:00]  Yep.  I meant to tell you that.  I saw that.  Whatever.  Another great episode of Louie.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we eat something?  All right.  Let's go make love.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back. 
[01:16:30]  I'm chewing.  Sorry.  I try not to eat on the air anymore.  It smells fucking good.  Honestly, it's shit today.  Egg whites and just dry wheat toast.  I smell syrup.  Yeah, it's syrup.  I got a little jelly on the side.  Something smells like syrup.  Sirius XM just ran a promo saying,  hey, breaking news,  go to our news channels.  I would like to say  that we're doing a fine job  right here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Yeah, you don't need to go  to the news channels.  What are they going to give you?  We're not giving you... 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Well, I mean,  I see why they would do that,  but maybe leave that promo off our channel  if you knew what we were about.  Meh, see?  Meh.  Meh.  We could take care of this.  Trust me.  Meh.  Better than anybody.  We're giving very good news coverage  just with some dirty words.  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Have we cursed?  I have a little bitch.  We say this guy's a motherfucker.  Yeah.  That's what we say.  So what's the latest?  Well, now all the networks  are going to commercial now  because I guess it's like,  you know,  it's hit that point  where there's pretty much...  CNN's still on it.  Let's see what they got.  I'm also good.  A little shaked up. 
[01:17:30]  Mm-hmm.  But I'm feeling...  Thank God I got out of lies,  me and my girlfriend.  Well, we're glad to see that.  Thanks for that...  For talking with us this morning.  Appreciate it.  This is live pictures,  aerial shots  of what we believe  is the shooter's car.  We know that this is  the back entrance  of the theater  and by numerous witness reports...  This would never have happened  at the Alex.  ...the way that the shooter  came into the movie theater  was through the exit  and was able to kick in  one of the doors  by one person's description  so that he was right 
[01:18:00]  at the front of the theater  while the movie was going.  We believe that this is his vehicle  because police had described  a search...  Okay.  Let me go with this  a little bit.  So the car is in the back  of the theater.  He kicks open that door, right?  Yeah.  I wonder if someone  helped him out.  I wonder if someone  got into the theater,  got his ticket for the movie,  knew where the exit was  and pried it open for the guy  and then left the theater,  obviously,  because he didn't want  to be part of the massacre.  Let me tell you something.  They say...  How does he kick open  that door from the back  of the theater?  I'm going to say  that because the exit door 
[01:18:30]  opening would make a noise.  There's probably no way  to prop that open.  You know,  a fire exit door,  I imagine,  sounds an alarm.  Right?  Not...  Not...  Yeah,  a lot of them do.  But I don't know.  They're saying  he's a lone gunman  and he's pretty much  blurted out everything  about the incendiary device  in his car  and his house  and shit,  so...  So how does he get  into that back door?  They're kind of showing  the door he could have  entered.  Entered in.  Oh, yeah?  It's not easy  to get into a movie theater  from the back like that. 
[01:19:00]  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know shit.  Let's see what...  The scanner zoom?  Scanners.  Police scanner,  of course,  from Aurora.  This is from Aurora.  Colorado.  Police scanner.  They probably,  all the good stuff  was on priority channels,  which I don't have on here.  I knew an Aurora once.  Tactical channels.  It's pretty quiet,  quite frankly.  Well, we saw them  at this Goodman's  apartment complex. 
[01:19:30]  Yes, they had  a little camera  on a stick  and they were looking  through the windows  to see what they could  see inside, right?  I don't want anything  to happen like on Speed  where they went  to the guy's house  and remember that.  Right.  Someone sent me  to this girl's Twitter.  I don't know  if this is true or not.  I'm literally  getting my news  off Twitter,  so this could be wrong.  But last tweet...  There was information  only on a robbery  that just occurred  in Denver at gunpoint.  A robbery?  Well, I would imagine  if you were...  A criminal,  you'd be an opportunist  today and say,  well...  Take this opportunity 
[01:20:00]  to...  Yeah, the odds are  they're a little busy.  I can maybe get  something done quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  Last tweet  from Jessica Redfield  who was reportedly  killed in the theater.  She wrote,  movie doesn't start  for 20 minutes.  And she was just  tweeting from the theater.  People's last tweets  from the theater  will eventually now...  Ah, it's terrible.  You know,  none of it was  happening during,  but they probably  all just finished  right before that movie.  There's something  chilling about that.  Man.  Damn. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, man.  That's pretty bad.  Eh.  Shit's just, like,  fucked up.  Yeah.  People gotta just  fucking knock this shit off.  Hey, stop it.  Hey, you.  I'm shaking my fist.  Hey, you.  The entrance is in the back.  The fire exit  is on the front,  or in the front.  Brian is saying  on the phones right now.  Hold on.  Let me,  let's just go to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Well, the entrance  to the movie theater  is on the back,  on the sides, 
[01:21:00]  and then,  but they have fire exits  on each side  of movie screens,  like in every movie theater.  So, I don't know,  maybe the guy  propped it open himself,  but normally  you're not allowed  to do that.  You know,  normally they got  people watching it,  especially with a movie  like that.  Right,  where they're terrified  about people filming  and capturing video  and selling it  in the black market.  The black market.  Yeah,  everything's kind of  beefed up.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let me go to Matt.  Matt, what's up? 
[01:21:30]  Good morning, boys.  I have a confirmed report  that was on the radio  this morning  and on television  was that prior  to the shooting,  someone stepped out  to take an emergency  phone call  and went out  that exit door  that the shooter  apparently came in.  So,  could be how it happened.  Huh.  Yeah,  reason to go out  that door  and maybe,  you know,  maybe leave it  pried open a little bit.  Right.  Who knows?  I'm wondering  if that was  possibly an accomplice.  I don't know,  but that was something  that came out this morning.  Yeah,  I'm a little suspicious, 
[01:22:00]  that's all.  Yeah.  I get he's a lone nut,  but, I mean,  does he have a friend?  You know,  I don't know.  Who knows?  Who the fuck knows?  It's hard to find  two people.  Or maybe the guy  with the emergency call,  now this is getting  really crazy,  is the actual shooter.  He goes out that door,  keeps it pried open,  puts his stuff on,  and comes back in.  Just a dumb thought.  I want to acknowledge  it's just a dumb thought.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you, boys.  I don't know.  It's one of those things.  Even if the doors open 
[01:22:30]  a crack,  people know in the theater,  in a dark theater,  you see when doors  are open like that.  They're not showing.  Stop it.  They like to try  to keep everything dark.  Shut that fucking door.  I used to work  in a theater,  and you could open  those doors really easily.  I'm a firefighter,  and it's impossible  to open that door  from the outside.  See, this is what  the reports are.  Of course.  Just people  not knowing shit.  A gang unit  was on scene.  We've got to wrap  things up,  but is there really  much of a gang problem  in Aurora, Colorado? 
[01:23:00]  What does that have  to do with anything?  A gang unit  was sent to the theater.  Well, they're going  to send everybody.  Everybody, right.  Everybody.  Talking on CNN.  Checking all the cars  in the parking lot  for explosives.  That will go on  for quite some time.  That was a police chief,  Dan Coates,  the Aurora police chief,  updating people  on what happened there.  We have Christine  monitoring what's happening  in area hospitals.  And we know  that the youngest victim  so far of the theater 
[01:23:30]  shooting,  a patient who is doing fine,  we're told,  an ER doctor telling KCNC,  the youngest patient  is three months old,  doing fine, thankfully.  But a three-month-old  is the youngest patient.  We know that...  What are you doing  with a three-month-old  in a movie theater  that everybody wants  to see the movie?  You bring a three-month-old  at midnight,  selfish, shitty parents.  Fucking A.  The medical center  of Aurora has,  I think,  or sorry,  Denver Medical  has five in fair condition,  11 in critical condition there.  That's the issue here 
[01:24:00]  with this.  Some people have tear gas,  decontamination  they're going through.  Some people have  some shrapnel injuries.  Some people have grazing.  And they're okay.  They're in fair condition,  but they have  gunshot-related wounds.  There are others, though,  who are in surgery  at this hour  in critical condition.  And it's a pretty,  still very dangerous moment  for some of those people  who were taken  out of that theater.  One thing that's interesting  as well about the moments  after this shooting,  again,  a midnight showing  of the dark night. 
[01:24:30]  Some were taken  to area hospitals  and ambulances.  Some came in on foot later  as they realized  that they had minor injuries  so that,  and some came in the back  of police cars.  As they realized  they had minor injuries  later on.  Oh, boy.  A walking out of the theater.  What is that?  With the still not moving body  of a small child,  a little girl,  a six-year-old  or a nine-year-old,  depending on which  I witness you're talking to.  We still don't know  the status of that child,  but a child who was taken  out of the theater  unconscious.  Police spokesmen said 
[01:25:00]  that they arrested  the suspect  in the rear  of Parking Lot Theater.  He's reported  to be 24 years old,  a man who lives  in North Aurora.  We've seen aerial pictures  of what is believed  to be his residence.  Give a name.  Give a fucking everything.  Come on.  Police and firefighters  and ambulances as well.  Gotta know at this point.  We've also seen pictures  of what is believed  to be the suspect's car,  a white vehicle,  that we saw  some of law enforcement  searching a little bit  earlier this morning.  We're told that the gunman  was heavily armed,  wearing a gas mask 
[01:25:30]  and goggles as well,  and heavily with the shotgun,  a rifle,  according to eyewitness descriptions,  and also police  say they found  a third weapon gun  in the theater.  We want to get to  John Berman.  He's got an update  on what is happening  on Twitter  as people were early,  really among the first  to report  what was going on  in the movie theater.  Soledad,  this is a national tragedy,  and as you would expect,  our nation's leaders  are now weighing in.  We have a statement  I want to read you  from President Obama 
[01:26:00]  who says,  Michelle and I  are shocked and saddened  by the horrific  and tragic shooting  in Colorado.  Federal and local  law enforcement  are still responding,  and my administration  will do everything  that we can  to support the people  of Aurora  in this extraordinarily  difficult time.  Which means nothing.  We are committed  to bringing whoever  was responsible  to justice,  ensuring the safety  of our people,  and for those  who have been wounded.  This is President Obama.  As we do,  when confronted  by moments of darkness  and challenge,  we must now come together  as one American family.  All of us  must have the people 
[01:26:30]  of Aurora  in our thoughts and prayers  as they confront  the loss of family,  friends,  and neighbors,  and we must stand  together with them  in the challenging hours  and days to come.  The President was  informed of this shooting  by his Homeland Security  advisor,  John Brennan,  around 5.30 a.m.  this morning.  The FBI now  racing to the scene  to help out.  Of course,  Mitt Romney,  the Republican nominee,  presumptive nominee,  also putting out  a statement this morning.  Mitt Romney says,  another nonsense statement.  And his wife,  Ann and I,  are deeply saddened  by the news  of the senseless violence  that took the lives  of 15 people in Colorado 
[01:27:00]  and injured dozens more.  He says 15 at this point,  CNN reporting 14 people killed.  What does he know?  Mitt Romney continues,  we are praying  for the families  and loved ones  of the victims  during this time  of deep shock  and immense grief.  We expect that the person  responsible for this  terrible crime  will be quickly  By the way,  why do they have to  correct him  during his statement?  Who cares what CNN's reporting?  Scheduled a campaign  in Florida today.  You can expect,  I imagine,  that their comments  will be tempered  somewhat today.  So let's add.  Yeah,  one would have to imagine.  Right, John,  thank you for that. 
[01:27:30]  The eyewitness description  has been absolutely horrific  as they describe the gun  entering the movie theater  and then eventually  just opening fire  seemingly randomly  at the people  who in some cases  still thought  the movie was going on,  still thought  some of the noise  you would think  that was part  of the fucking  some kind of  a weird promotional  thing they were doing  for the first  everyone sitting there  in shock.  Yeah.  She said that  a man  about six feet tall,  taller than her  kicked through the door 
[01:28:00]  and he was in  a light  people will always think  in that situation  that people are taller.  How do you  kick through the door?  She said that  he was completely  covered in all black  with goggles  and she said  that after that point  when she saw  that he was holding  a shotgun  her and her boyfriend  dropped to the floor  and just kind of  started to crawl  to see if they could  get away.  They got up  and they started  to run through  the emergency exit. 
[01:28:30]  She said that  when she turned around  all she saw  was the guy  slowly making  his way up the stairs  and just firing  chilling people  just picking  random people.  Fucking chilling.  It appears that  there was some sort  of smoke or gas.  We're hearing reports  of an explosion.  We don't know  if that was part  of the smoke  and gas  or a separate device  explosive device  from.  So this is a very  fluid investigation  but I continue  to get more information 
[01:29:00]  about that now.  So this is going  to be a full  national investigation  bringing in  ATF,  FBI,  who knows  how many sources  it's going to bring  to bear.  We're going to be  coming back to you  after this break  but I want to talk  to you about  how do people  get the ability  to get tear gas  grenades.  Is that legal  and should it be  legal going forward?  No, it's not.  Shut up.  Apparently the guy  was wearing a gas mask  in the theater  moments before  he set off  some sort of tear gas 
[01:29:30]  explosive device  and then as the people  started to panic  to run out  he was down front  and he started  shooting.  And we are going  to have more  breaking the game  with the lady  than just all out of it.  By the time I left  I overheard the nurses  saying they've managed  to get most everyone  stabilized  which is a blessing  it really is.  He did not resist  he did not put up a fight  I don't know  if the exact details  of the officers  surprised him  or how it actually  happened  but I know  some of the 
[01:30:00]  first officers  that arrived  within I don't know  if it was seconds  maximum a couple minutes  found him behind  the theater.  had his car  and took him  into custody there.  That's some of what  the eyewitnesses  on the scene  have been saying  this morning  in the wake  of this terrible tragedy  14 people  is the number  given to us  by police.  Alright.  We gotta catch up  with breaks  and we'll get  Donald Trump Jr.  in here.  Is he here?  I would imagine  he's  the Trumpster. 
[01:30:30]  He's close  if not here already.  What is Piers  saying on Twitter  more Americans  will buy guns  after this  to defend themselves  and so the dangerous  spiral descends.  What does that mean?  When how does it stop?  Take your English  fucking bullshit  back to England  you cocksucker.  What the fuck  does that mean?  Stop trying to  put an agenda  on this.  They take something  like this  a tragedy  and they always  try to put some  kind of fucking  agenda to it. 
[01:31:00]  Well we gotta  stop these  You know what?  I love guns.  Love them!  I'm not gonna  fucking go  and start  shooting up  a movie theater.  Don't worry  about it Piers.  And as are  the large  vast majority  of responsible  legal  gun owners.  Almost all.  Yes.  This will happen.  This fucking  happens.  It's a horrible  world we live in  where horrible  things happen  sometimes.  It doesn't 
[01:31:30]  mean you gotta  then take  everything away  from people  when somebody  uses something  for evil.  You know?  Because really  drunk driving  kills a lot  more people  than random  shooters.  They don't talk  about taking  away cars.  Or alcohol.  They don't talk  about banning  alcohol.  Ban alcohol.  When drunk  driving kills  people.  Alcohol and  cigarettes.  The biggest  killers in this  fucking country.  Which is way  worse than guns.  Stop.  Way the fuck  worse.  God you can't  fucking.  When is this  going to stop? 
[01:32:00]  Shut up.  Go get some  bobbies to  protect you.  Those fruits  with their dumb  big hats and  little clubs.  Oh I've had it  with that.  I would you know  something.  Yeah you could  say that if  somebody perhaps  had a gun in  the theater maybe  the fucking  count wouldn't  have.  He wouldn't  have stood up  and started  joining the  other gunmen  and shooting  the patrons.  Perhaps he  would have  shot the  gunman.  How about  what happened 
[01:32:30]  in that  internet cafe  where an  older gentleman  got up that  was armed and  started shooting  at the guys  that were  robbing the  place.  What if he  wasn't there?  Who knows how  that story might  have turned  out.  Maybe those  guys would  have shot  some of the  people in  that place.  You never  know what  would have  happened.  But it  didn't happen  because there  was an armed  guy in the  fucking internet  cafe.  Does everyone  know that  story?  I don't  think so.  What happened  quickly?  An elderly  gentleman was  sitting there  with his  wife at  an internet  cafe. 
[01:33:00]  Two gentlemen  walked in  with masks  on.  One with a  gun.  One with a  baseball bat.  And started  robbing the  people that  were in there  of their  valuables.  Well this  guy stood  up, drew  his gun, and  just started  firing at  these  motherfuckers who  were shocked  that they were  being shot at  and started  running out of  the place.  But you  don't hear  reports of  that like  literally that  might have  saved three  lives.  Let's just  say three  lives were  saved.  Yes.  Why isn't  peers going  on, or any  of these guys  going on  Twitter and 
[01:33:30]  going, when  will more  Americans get  guns and  stop these  horrible random  crimes?  Everyone is  fucking, everyone  has an agenda.  How about this  guy?  Let's say this  was happening  right now, this  horrible story  out of Aurora.  The guy stands  up, he  shoots a  person, a  guy stands  up that has  a legal gun  and shoots  the guy in  the face, he  drops, one  person's dead,  it's tragic, but  this would have  been a story, they 
[01:34:00]  wouldn't have been  covering it like  this, it would  have been, hey,  somebody was shot  in a movie  theater, and the  gunman was killed  by a legal gun  owner.  But now it's a  big story because  that didn't  happen.  Right.  It's,  it appears  as lunatics  like this will  always try and  get guns.  It should be  a hundred  thousand times  harder than it  is for them  to do so.  That's my  point.  A hundred  thousand times  harder to get  the guns.  How do you  know how, we  don't even know  how he got the  guns yet. 
[01:34:30]  We don't know  how he got the  guns.  Drugs are  illegal, people  get them.  Yes.  Guns are illegal  to have in many  instances, or  very strictly  regulated, people  get them.  It's, it's,  it's, you  know, there's  going to be  bad things  that happen.  It's, it's  not the fault  of the  hardware.  Yes, guns  make it much  easier to kill  people.  I understand  that argument.  But, cars, 
[01:35:00]  booze,  cigarettes, you  know.  A hat that's  made of some  type of toxic  material?  Oh, well,  poisonous hat.  Why don't we,  we're going to  break.  Donald Trump  Jr.'s here.  He's going to  join the show  next.  And, I  don't know,  we'll figure  out.  He's a gun  enthusiast.  We'll figure  out what to  do next, but  certainly we're  going to stay  on this because  it's a biggie.  And the news  is changing  every single  minute here.  So, stay  there.  We got Donald 
[01:35:30]  Trump Jr.  joining the  show.  Friend of  ours.  What's up,  Donald?  What's  going on, guys?  One of those  Ugg shows.  We couldn't  have been more  silly yesterday.  We had just a  dumb, silly,  really good radio  show with Dice and  Florentine and  the stripper that  wouldn't get  naked.  Jimmy's birthday.  Everyone had a  good time.  We went home.  We're laughing.  I was laughing all  day yesterday because 
[01:36:00]  of how silly the  show was.  And then you wake  up and it's an  Ugg show.  Yeah, it's a  little more gloomy.  Yeah.  What's your  thoughts?  You know, I  think it's a  shame that this  stuff happens.  You know what  I mean?  I don't know  what the  motivation is.  It's usually  a selfish guy  that wants to  be noticed,  has an agenda,  some manifesto.  Some lame  agenda, you  should say.  Yeah.  And the worst  part is in  about three  minutes it's  going to be  political as  opposed to  emotional.  This is going  to be the  poster for the 
[01:36:30]  next at least  conceivable four  or five hours  that these guys  will go after  each other on  various things  trying to make  it into something  it's not.  Yeah, that's  exactly it, man.  The media has a  way of doing  that.  Well, Piers is  focusing on the  gun issue already.  Listen, someone  who wants to do  this, to me,  and this sounds  horrible 15 minutes  after the fact,  but it's not a  gun.  If someone wants  to do something  like this, they'll  figure out a way  to do this.  There's no,  you're dealing  with a psychopath.  Right.  You're not dealing  with someone who's, 
[01:37:00]  well, I'm going to  do this because I  have a gun.  Give me a break,  guys.  It's crazy.  And then when  they legislate  more, they don't  go, well, I'm  crazy and I really  want to shoot up  this place, but  it's illegal.  Right.  Well, that's the  biggest problem.  It's like, to me,  gun control, the  only thing that it  controls is people  who are actually  willing to play  by the law.  Right.  So, you know,  this guy is  clearly not.  So, by the way,  if there were no  guns in existence,  he would figure out  a way to do  something like this,  whether it's with  a bomb or whether  with gasoline or  something.  Right. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, you know,  and that's the real  problem.  All you're doing is  preventing people who  otherwise.  Yes, exactly.  From doing so.  I mean, and that's,  you know, I strongly  believe in that, as  horrible as to say  even 15 minutes  after the fact.  I mean, it's...  Yeah.  Well, it's easy to  say because guns are  going to be brought  up a lot in the next  few days.  So, what is the  solution with the  gun thing, you  think?  Tougher laws?  Well, listen, I  mean, if you look  back historically,  any place where  they've eliminated  the guns, it  usually leads to  some sort of, you  know, genocide or  disaster, whether  it be, you know,  Russia during the  Stalin years. 
[01:38:00]  If you look at,  you know, prior to,  say, Nazi Germany,  the Roundup, you  know, all of  these, you know,  places in our  I mean, every place  in the world where  they basically said  eliminated guns,  you're just  preventing the  people from  defending themselves.  And America's not  going to get rid of  guns anytime soon.  That's also the  issue.  I mean, if you  could, if you  could say, fine,  I'll eliminate  every gun imaginable,  perhaps it'd be  different, but there  will always be a  black market for  guns.  And doors box is  open.  All you're doing is  preventing the  people from, you  know, who will 
[01:38:30]  actually follow the  laws from doing it  because you can  never eliminate the  black market.  This guy's never  thinking about, oh,  what are the laws?  I mean, he knows  he's either going,  Colorado's a death  penalty state.  He's going to, you  know, I just hope  they accelerate the  process so we don't  waste a lot of  taxpayer money.  You know, this guy,  oh, he's a nice guy,  but he's a little  crazy.  He's, you know,  they're going to  put this guy in  death row for 25  years.  Let's not forget  about that Jared guy.  Jared Loffner,  yeah.  Yeah, they haven't  accelerated anything  with him.  They're saying this  guy's name is James  Holmes, born December  13th of 87.  That's what the name 
[01:39:00]  of this guy is coming  out as.  That's true, but  that's crazy white guy.  That does sound like  a crazy, we're trying  to figure out who  white guys.  No middle name yet.  Not yet.  All those recycles  always have the middle  names.  Do they give that to  mass murderers or is it  only, this is a mass  murderer, where is a  serial killer always  get the three names?  Serial killer, I guess,  the three names.  John Wayne Gacy, but  Ted Bundy only had two,  but I don't know if  mass murderers get  them.  You know what I mean?  You know, drugs,  obviously illegal.  They're plenty available.  Yeah, I was at the  Roger Waters concert  last week.  I think I can attest 
[01:39:30]  to that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  A lot of pod in the  air.  Yeah.  Drunk driving, very  illegal.  People do it, take  lives all the time.  Legislating against  bad things doesn't  work against the  people that are just  going to continue to  do them.  It's not that easy  is what you're saying.  If you look at  Switzerland, they  actually issue guns  to every family in  Switzerland and they  teach them how to use  them and they have  the lowest crime rate  as it relates to gun  violence anywhere in  the world. 
[01:40:00]  But they're just weird  over there, let's be  honest with each other.  Perhaps.  They're very strange.  You can point to  examples and I don't  know that there's any  proof that says gun  control actually does  anything.  Frankly, in most of  the places where they  get a little bit looser  on the laws allowing  good citizens to have  them, I know there's a  lot of stats out there  showing the crime rate  goes down because  knowing there may be a  gun in a home is  certainly a deterrent.  It was a deterrent to  the Japanese when they  discussed invading the  United States during  World War II.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, wait a  minute.  They're all armed.  Every single house. 
[01:40:30]  That was a legitimate  thought by their military  command.  Yep.  It was just horrible.  Yeah, it's depressing.  It's fucking depressing.  We're just watching the  news coverage.  How awful MSM.  And it's not a political  thing.  CNN's doing the right  thing.  CNN and Fox both  covering it and MSNBC.  I don't know.  Morning Joe and this  fucking horrible nudge.  He hosts this fun  stopper that he hosts  with.  Yeah, they were talking  about Bain Capital and  it's like, maybe that  could wait the day.  Really? 
[01:41:00]  While you, you know, have  an unfolding story here.  Well, yeah, I mean,  that's a hundred percent.  And yet those are real  stories because you got,  you know, the president  attacking small businesses.  I mean, yesterday's  quote's like, well, you  didn't make it on your  own.  It's like, really?  Like, I don't know, man.  I deal with a lot of  small businesses.  I deal with a lot of guys  that own construction  companies.  You know, they have their  life guaranteed.  You know, their house is  on the line.  Like, to me, that's  different than someone  that shows up nine to  five, punches the clock,  does some work, gets a  paycheck.  Right.  Like, you know, those  guys, and there's 
[01:41:30]  definitely really valuable  employees.  I've seen that too.  But for the president to  basically say, well, you  didn't do it on your own.  It's like, I don't know,  man.  Those guys took some  serious risk for the  most part in small  business.  And so, I mean, to me,  that's still a big issue.  Fifteen minutes after an  incident like this, maybe  you don't talk about it,  but it's important because  it either means that the  president is totally  clueless.  Or he's just pandering to  a political side because  there's more people that  would love to believe that  they're indispensable who  show up nine to five and  punch a ticket than people  who are small business  owners.  Either way, it's bullshit.  When he started going  off about that, and the 
[01:42:00]  logic behind it was, hey,  look, you used the roads  to drive your materials.  Who was that woman?  What's her name?  She had the same take on  this as Obama did.  I know you're talking  about it.  Yeah, yeah.  It slips my mind right  about now.  I try to block people like  that out of my memory if I  possibly can.  But it was, it's like,  they're trying to make it  sound like, look, the  government was there to  help you with the  business.  But it's like, no, the  businesses are there to  keep your job. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  You're there to serve the  people.  Yeah.  The government's not the  thing making all of these  things happen.  Right, making it possible.  That's what they're trying  to make.  I mean, trying to sell that  story just goes to show  how out of their minds  these people are.  Out of touch and  anti-capitalist and  capitalism, we just  might have his Facebook  page.  Oh, I am.  Sam.  Oh, I am.  Yeah, here, here.  He thought so he  doesn't.  Sorry.  Well, guys, this  interview is going to  suck. 
[01:43:00]  You guys are never  having me back.  I know, right?  What the fuck?  It's just a weird day.  It's very weird.  It's hard to not  acknowledge it because  it's like it's  unfolding.  They just keep coming  out with like shots of  his apartment now.  We want to talk about  those horrible bunkers  in Scotland.  Yeah, I'm obsessed  with the golf in  Scotland and you guys  just opened up a  course there.  I saw you tweeting  about it.  It came out awesome,  man.  I mean, Sandy Jones,  the head of the PGA  was there.  He saw it and he  basically, at the  press conference, and  this is a political  thing for him in that  world.  If you're the head of 
[01:43:30]  the PGA, when he  says, it's a top three  course, the problem is  I can't name number two  and three.  This is a guy who  makes his living  traveling the world to  see golf courses for  tournaments and these  sort of things.  Who designs your  courses?  Everywhere's different.  Over there, it's a  Lynx-style course, so  Martin Hawtry, he's the  guy that does it for  all the Lynx courses  over there for the  Royal and Ancient.  So he's got the main  guy, is what I'm  saying.  His grandfather built  most of the open  venues a hundred  years ago.  I mean, it really is a  special place.  I mean, the land is  just so good.  I mean, I could have  designed an incredible  course there because 
[01:44:00]  the land is just so  amazing.  So Colin Montgomery  was out there opening  it up.  I played in the second  foursome with Martin  Laird, who's a top  30 golfer right now.  Needless to say,  that was a humbling  experience.  Oh, yeah, huh?  Yeah, I'm like, I'm  pretty long off the  tee.  I'm a horrible golfer,  but I have some  distance.  And this guy's blowing  it past me at like  60 yards, and I'm  just like, oh my  God, it's ridiculous.  How is it to play  there?  I hear it's the wind.  It's a very different  game.  It's not like golf,  like you play here.  I mean, it's almost  like a separate sport, 
[01:44:30]  but you use the same  equipment because  there, a lot of the  game is about rolling  the ball.  You keep it low because  the wind really  affects it, so it's  not like, well, I'm  going to shoot it  there, and the ball  is just going to  rest.  The greens are  designed to be fast.  I mean, you may be  putting from 60 yards  out kind of thing.  It's a different game.  You've got the dunes  on the side.  If you go in there,  you're dead.  Yeah, they go with  the giant greens over  there.  I mean, giant.  Yeah, it's a totally  different sport.  You know, the wind,  they play in the rain,  they play in the snow,  they don't care.  It's a different...  And those bunkers,  man, with that just 
[01:45:00]  wall.  Yeah, they're revetted  bunkers.  They basically take turf  and stack it upside  down on top of each  other, so it makes  almost like a sod wall  that's vertical.  It's a lot harder  to get out of.  Yeah, you've got to  pop it over that thing  or go backwards.  Is that him, Sam,  or no?  That can't be him  because they said it's  a white guy that did it.  They did say it's  a white guy?  Well, this guy's going  to get a lot of  attention on his  Facebook page.  He lives in Aurora?  Because I also heard  someone witnessed it  said they thought he 
[01:45:30]  was an Indian guy.  Oh, man.  So they could have  mistaken a light-skinned  black guy for an  Indian guy.  Or maybe the news  is just right  and the name  is a different guy.  The news is often  not right.  That's true, too.  And they said  white male.  But they'll never  let that get in  the way of a good  story.  No, that's true.  Let's hit this  for a second.  ...kept at a  distance, according  to reporters there.  It has not been  confirmed that this  is the shooter's  apartment complex,  but between this  location...  What else could it be? 
[01:46:00]  ...the vehicle that  we believe...  There's a bomb squad  outside the window.  Why else would they  be an Aurora dummy?  Sometimes you can just  go over this.  We haven't confirmed  this yet.  ...on this particular  building and obviously  continuing to...  Oh, he's breaking  the window.  He's breaking the  window.  Like, if I were him,  I would be off to the  side instead of in  front of the window.  Like, there is a bomb.  Yeah.  They're probably figuring  it's hooked up to the  door, not the fucking  window.  We're going to come back  in just a moment.  A bomb.  I don't know how to  gamble my life on that. 
[01:46:30]  I would go through the  roof.  Cut a hole.  No, this guy told them...  Before they were  reporting 14 dead,  then I heard 15,  now they're saying 12.  Yeah, well that number's  going to change,  obviously.  But this guy told them  there's a bomb in the car.  He told them there's a  bomb in the house,  whatever.  Why does he want this  information out there?  Yeah, if you're trying  to kill people,  you want the element  of surprise.  Unless he wants them  to find what he has.  Images from overnight  where there was a  massacre at the moon  theater.  They were showing 
[01:47:00]  at midnight.  It's going to be one  of these guys.  Little nobody who  needs to be heard.  Yeah, he didn't want  to draw his gun when  all the cops are out  there and die in a  blaze of glory because  he knows he's going to  be...  We don't know who he  is right now, but boy,  he is going to be the  most popular guy in a  few hours.  Everyone's going to  know his name.  Everyone's going to  see his picture.  You're not going to  be able to get away  from this guy's  picture.  He will be the most  known person in this  country in a few  hours.  Is that him, Sam?  No.  No, you're just...  You're just searching 
[01:47:30]  every James Holmes.  Unfortunately, I think  there's probably...  That's a pretty  common name.  Yeah.  In Colorado.  Jimmy Holmes.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think...  The black guy's the  only one in Aurora.  Is it?  Yeah.  But they said he  may have had...  Check Tennessee  because they said  his car may have  had Tennessee plates.  It's something I  remember seeing.  So maybe he just  recently moved there  and still didn't...  Did you look at the  content of that site  to see what that  guy wrote about?  Yeah, a little.  I mean, he's a 
[01:48:00]  personal trainer.  He doesn't have  anything about  superheroes.  Nothing about  craziness?  No, he likes beer.  All right.  He's a laptop!  He likes beer.  That's crazy.  I don't think it's a  guy that likes beer.  Works out and likes beer.  I will get healthier.  I will look better.  I will eat right.  Oh, this guy  sounds like a nut.  Oh, boy.  Why would you  ever do that?  What else?  He's got pictures  of kids and stuff  on there.  I don't think  that's the guy.  Yeah, I don't  think so either.  A relative?  That is relative.  But if he lives  in Aurora, he's  going to get shit 
[01:48:30]  for a long time.  Of course he is.  Oh, man.  He's like,  God damn.  I want to go  through the process  of changing your name.  Yes, Jimmy.  They're saying now  it's reported  that he crashed  his car into  the fire door  and then tossed  the tear gas in  and came in shooting.  But his car  looked to be parked.  Yeah, his car  wasn't there.  They were going  through it  with one of those  bomb robots  and stuff like that.  It was on the spot.  Yeah.  You're going to get  all sorts of crazy reports  until they figure it out. 
[01:49:00]  It's going to take a while  to get an accurate  assessment.  Right.  No manifestos  on that page?  Nothing, Samuel?  He's got a really  nice watch.  Oh, give him a watch.  Do I look upon that  or sell it?  Was that James Cameron?  Because someone's  saying James Cameron  was in an adjacent theater.  Was that the director  who just lives out there?  No.  No.  I would doubt it.  I think he'd get a screener.  No, but I mean  maybe he wanted to go.  I would think he would  have seen it before this.  Right, right.  Some people like  to go to the theater.  Maybe he wanted  to go see a theater  with people. 
[01:49:30]  I don't think people  are going to the theater  for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's another thing.  This is going to  fuck up the numbers.  Oh, yeah.  People are going to be  scared to go tonight.  And I heard it was good,  but, yeah.  It was good.  It doesn't really matter.  I ain't bringing my kids.  Well, I mean,  that was the strange thing,  by the way.  It was like a midnight showing  and I'm hearing about  three-month-olds  getting shot.  Who brings a three-month-old  to a midnight showing  of a movie?  Selfish fucking parents.  Someone that couldn't  find a babysitter.  Just going to have  the baby crying  during the movie.  I don't know.  It's just rude  because of exactly  what you just said,  Ant, but I don't know. 
[01:50:00]  I don't think it's  something I would do.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't either.  Well, we'll have more info.  Don't worry.  We're your news station  right here.  We sure are.  It's broken the window.  It's broken the window  of the apartment building.  What happened?  You were woken up  and they said what?  Well, actually,  it started going on  around 1 a.m. this morning.  I heard a lot of commotion  outside.  So me and my sister,  we went outside  to see what was going on. 
[01:50:30]  And next thing you know,  we've seen all kinds  of police running up  with their son  and they had guns  like drawn  and running towards  the apartment building.  And at first I thought  it was the apartment building.  I was just like,  hey, should we be concerned?  They're like,  no, no, it's fine.  Just go back inside.  Then I seen the swamp  pull up the bomb squad  and they're canines  and I was like,  what's wrong?  Do I need to be worried?  And they're just like,  no, go inside, go inside.  Tennessee?  Yeah, this guy's a little bit,  this guy's a little different.  He's got the shaved head. 
[01:51:00]  It seemed like there were  a lot of minorities  being interviewed.  A lot of tattoos.  You know, on the news today.  So that guy looks a lot  more like a James Holmes.  I think we may be  onto something  with the Tennessee.  Oh, man, this guy looks a little...  Yeah, the full chest skull tattoo.  Yeah.  Not that we want a stereotype.  Death before dishonor.  He's got tattooed on himself.  And it's actually written backwards.  Well, maybe that's  because he's taking a picture  in the mirror there.  So you can see it  when he's running  behind your car 
[01:51:30]  trying to kill you.  His about page is,  all my experiences  have been real.  Everything that I've been through  has endured  has been real  and I've been real  to a lot of fake-ass people.  But through all that,  I figured out  some real-ass mottos  to share.  Okay, and he's got his dumb...  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't know.  The guy's either really stupid  or the killer.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  It's 50-50.  Yeah.  Or both.  No, he's got pictures  kissing his chick 
[01:52:00]  and this might just be  a regular dude.  He looks a little crazy.  Because chances are  whoever did this  just got dumped.  Well, that looks like  a mugshot, doesn't it?  Yeah, really.  That looks like a mugshot.  He's wearing like  an orange jumpsuit.  And he puts it on his  Facebook page?  And you put that  on your Facebook page?  He's proud of his mugshots.  That's...  That might be...  I don't know, guys.  We may be on to something.  He has a good profile.  That's probably why.  I'm willing to just  jump to conclusions.  Hey, it'd be huge  if you guys were the guys  that discovered  who the guy is.  Who the guy is.  He's got a first, didn't he?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what the hell  Is that like his naked wife 
[01:52:30]  lying on the couch  with his kid?  No, it's another kid.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That looks like  some boob action there.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, but that looks like  it's a little girl  with no shirt on.  It's a boy.  It is.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I don't know.  I'm willing to say yes.  I'm just going to...  I'm going to fry him.  Fry him.  I don't need...  Yeah, get that guy.  The apartment across  is we evacuated them  and we believe  that there is  some kind of  bomb making materials  located inside 
[01:53:00]  of that apartment  so we may evacuate  the whole area.  So they were very clear  with you.  Describe for me,  I'm looking at a very tight shot  of this apartment complex.  It looks sort of medium size.  Can you describe for me  what the neighborhood's like  and what this apartment complex,  the one that's now  surrounded by SWAT,  is like?  Well, usually it's a pretty  like calm area.  It's like there's a school  about...  There's a school  on the same block  as the apartment  that you're looking at. 
[01:53:30]  It's a really cool,  calm, collected area  but lately there's been  a lot of police  like activity  and I don't know,  it may be because  a lot of things  have been happening  in Aurora  like shootings and stuff  but there's a lot  of police activity lately  and I just thought  it was another  one of them days,  you know,  one of the nights  that the police  were here again.  but it's usually  before this,  before the summer started  it was like a cool area  like you weren't  afraid to be outside.  And is it an area  frequented by young people?  Is it... 
[01:54:00]  Describe...  How would you describe  the neighborhood  to somebody?  It's majority families  because it's right down by...  It's right in the school.  It's right in the school  right in the area.  Our continuing coverage  of the Aurora shooting  on the Opie Anthony program.  So where's everybody  been moved to?  I mean,  where are you right now?  Because obviously  you've got to move  a distance back  from that building  which is right near  your building  and of course  all the people  in that building  and we're looking  at live pictures  of what we believe  is the suspect's  apartment building. 
[01:54:30]  They're in a cherry picker  from the fire truck.  Now they're at the fire department  using a crane  trying to gain access  to the window.  Where does anybody  even put?  They got them  little cameras  on a stick there.  They evacuated  like two blocks  the whole perimeter  and they just have us  like five blocks  away from the scene  and they really  didn't tell us too much.  They just wrote  over to us  and told us  that we should  be taken to a gym  if we needed  somewhere to go  but besides that 
[01:55:00]  they just told us  like both down  on the corner.  Unless he was just  listing stuff  that's at his house.  Rebecca Bradshaw  updating us  on what's happening  in her neighborhood.  This is North Aurora  and she describes it  as a family  neighborhood  full of families  it's now the focus  of a SWAT team  and you can see  the fire truck  they're trying to gain  access to that apartment  building through the window  they've been doing this  now for the last  hour plus  that we've been watching it  Rebecca says  that she heard  a booming sound  that she would describe  as some kind of explosion  from this apartment building 
[01:55:30]  she said  the police  showed up  with their guns drawn  sent everybody  back inside  to her complex  which is across the street  she says  SWAT team  bomb squad  canine unit  as well  and she said  eventually  in the last couple  of hours  they were evacuated  being told  by the police  doing the evacuation  that we believe  that there is  bomb making material  inside that particular  apartment building  this is consistent  with what the police  chief told us  early this morning  in the very early hours  after this terrible  shooting  at this movie theater 
[01:56:00]  that in fact  they were searching  that Elvis Duran  said the movie  should be pulled  ASAP  yeah I guess so  why would he say that  is he really that  much of a dope  that's pretty sick  the suspect identified  as James Holmes  police have a 24 year old  man in custody  24 year old  James Holmes  how old is the guy  on the Facebook page  Sam  he didn't have his age  I don't know  that guy didn't look that old  but he may have looked 
[01:56:30]  older than 24  that guy looks  no  too good looking  to kill people  yeah he's a great body  I don't know what  you're talking about buddy  yeah  do you have to  his words not mine  yeah  what's going on there sir  just a handsome guy  yeah  I see Fred Willard  on the  on Fox Business  he thought he skated today  yeah he was like  he's the only person  in America  that was happy  about this thing  because we would have  had a lot of fun  with that one today  oh man  yes 
[01:57:00]  the old hole in the bottom  of the popcorn trick  yeah he was  in a porno theater  Fred Willard  you know him from all those  great Christopher Guest movies  he was in a porno theater  and they apparently  caught him  spanking it  he was jacking  in the theater  but it's like  it's a porno theater  leave the guy alone  if you're going there  in the first place  I don't know  you go in there  for the content  the odds are  you might pull out your dick  I want to see the plot  who's going to be offended  by the way  if you're  I don't think anyone  in the theater 
[01:57:30]  even cared  that he was jacking off  a seedy  adult theater  really  gives a fuck  how embarrassing  honestly  given all of the content  not that I know  about any of this stuff  for the record  but given all the content  that's out there  how is the porn industry  a multi-billion dollar industry  isn't there enough  that you can get for free  for free  and the privacy  of your own home  why are you going to a movie  they're losing money  pop-up ads  they're looking at making the money  yeah they're losing  a lot of money now  yeah  X hamster's a great sight  but for a long time 
[01:58:00]  sure they mean a shitload  I guess he just didn't  know how to use a computer  maybe that's what it is  he's sort of  of that generation  they have no evidence  he didn't realize  there's a pretty big cache  of free stuff out there  in any way  or terrorism  or terrorism  but under the law  under federal law  there may be  a charge of terrorism  that could be lodged  against Mr. Holmes  if in fact  he's formally accused  and there are certain  statutes in the state  of Colorado  that may speak  to this kind of  conduct  so not the type 
[01:58:30]  of Al-Qaeda terrorism  but  homegrown terrorism  now you're going to get  all of this one  homegrown terrorism  if he's guilty of it  try him  let him appeal  do it in about three weeks  and fry the fucker  and then just  done with him  done  where you can't even  go see a movie  oh Jared Loftor  is Arizona  you can't go see a movie  you can see a movie  this is very rare  this never happens  it never happens  what is society  when you can't go see a movie  I think if you go to the movies 
[01:59:00]  right now  you'll probably be fine  and how many movies  were shown last night  where people were fine  there were 65 million gun owners  who didn't kill anyone  yesterday  who didn't kill anyone  yeah  unfortunately we're never  going to be perfect  they got the windows out  and they're still just  taking a peek in there  would you crawl through  that window at?  no  no  I saw that  you ever see Speed  oh my god  I go into his house  he looks  and kaboom 
[01:59:30]  kablamo  that's where I do  want to be management  you know  I think you should go in now  maybe look a little bit  to the left there  just report on the radio  how you're doing  tell me what's in there  go ahead  that's a really small  apartment complex  they got an aerial view now  it doesn't look like  many apartments at all  it's one cracker box  kind of building  not complex at all  probably maybe  12 apartments total  I would guess  yeah yeah maybe  three floors  that is a shit  oh there's another  building next to it  I'm not quite sure  what they're doing  if they're trying to  gain access through the window 
[02:00:00]  you're probably not  living in Versailles  yeah yeah  did you hear  she goes  we're not really sure  quite what they're doing  if they're trying to  gain access  of course they're  gaining access  they want to get inside  but they're being  very cautious  they're checking the drapes  against the car  maybe MSNBC's right  maybe they know  they would just have  rambling idiots  on like this  by the way  there is some truth  to what you did  I mean  because in three hours  they will know  nothing more  right  and it will still be 
[02:00:30]  not that it won't be  a news story  but they'll tell you  the same thing  a thousand times  there's nothing worse  than that in the news cycle  because I'll listen to it  sometimes in the background  when I'm at the office  it's like  how many times  can I hear the story  of what someone said  it's a 20 minute loop  it's basically  but you can't help yourself  you sit in front of that TV  with these big events  and you just take it all in  you can't help yourself  but you're right  not much changes  poking around  with a very long stick  I like it  it's 2012  and people still poke things  with sticks  it's fantastic 
[02:01:00]  that's how far we've come  that's how far we've come  what you can do  I don't know  poke it with a stick  see what it does  ah damn it  pulling his screen out  alright they're getting close to  they're looking in the bathroom  I guess  are they kitchen?  yeah that looks like a kitchen window  the bathroom's a little square one  is a reporter from KMGH  and he's joining us now  how scary would it be  how scary would it be  to get in that apartment  and slowly make your way around us  fire department are fucking crazy man  they really are 
[02:01:30]  oh here we go  in suburban Denver  that was being searched  there's also an extensive search  still taking place  here on the crime scene  in this movie theater parking lot  items of interest inside  all the cars  are still here  that's interesting  very interested in that  and it's not just detectives  from Denver  but from really  across the whole state  we've also learned  the FBI is here  they're going through  this entire parking lot  looking at each of the cars  perhaps there is something  there  something left behind  that can't explain 
[02:02:00]  what happened  we have been talking  to the local police  here all morning long  one thing that they have wanted  to stress to us  is that things have been changing  and at this point  they are telling us  that at least 12 people are dead  two of the people  passed away in the hospital  the other 10 passed away  here at the movie theater  and at least 50 people injured  a lot of people here  have been concerned  nothing new there  I wonder if this guy  was a fired movie theater employee  where some weird shit 
[02:02:30]  just happened  it's always right after  something  unless they're completely nuts  like the postal guy  yeah yeah  it's something in his life  he got dumped  unless they're like  just manic depressive  a girl  crazy  fired or something  maybe  his wife left him  yeah yeah  something lame like that  and he's got to fucking  be an asshole  yeah and get a little  attention for himself  well that one again  if you know  I don't think I saw someone  who wasn't like a minority  you know being interviewed  and if they're saying  it's a 24 year old white guy  that's you know  yeah 
[02:03:00]  and that'll be the next part  of the story  because that's different  than a disgruntled employee  because that brings up  the whole racism argument  racism  yeah  yeah  well  we'll see  like I said  in no time  we're going to know  exactly who this guy is  check the police scanner  they're saying  it's saying that the boyfriend  of one of the victims  is on his way to kill  shooters family members  what  again that could be  total nonsense  I'm getting it off Twitter  but you know  that's where I go  for my news  my news  you'd be surprised  how much comes out  though 
[02:03:30]  honestly like  I see about a lot  of stuff there first  yeah  you know  it's not always  the most accurate  but the first time  you hear  you know  I trust Twitter  before  all that stuff  yeah  let's go to the police scanner  and James is also  responding to your  senior point of contact  will be with an officer  unit 322  this injury is for  a noon age party  suspect  of what 
[02:04:00]  is that  is that Aurora Colorado  or is that  yeah  no this is Aurora  Colorado  could be something else  they got some great apps  on this thing  yeah  police scanner app  it just  I usually listen to the  Chicago one  at night  wow  just for fun  yeah  it's insane  it's like an action movie  it's crazy  helicopters  freaking car chases  gunfire  Chicago's  Chicago's a 
[02:04:30]  crazy place  and by the way  we'll be there  August 10th  CBS is reporting  suspect's apartment  is booby trapped  and police can see  what looks like  buckets of ammunition  safe rest  wow  wow  a party  metro 14  you've got  a whole bunch 
[02:05:00]  of people  coming towards you  do you need  any more bodies  engine  a whole bunch  of people  coming at you  what is this  like a mob  let's find out  by the way  that's much more  interesting than  the same old thing  they're telling us  on the news  I know right  you come up  and I'll  either  face to face  I'm over here  at Paris  or your traffic  at 17th  and I'll give you  an update  of what's going  on here  10 to 1  okay  I don't know 
[02:05:30]  what's happening  that's  Jesus Christ  tell me  yeah  go ahead  626  thanks  go ahead  626  roger  roger  what's your  vector  have you ever  seen a grown  man naked  like movies  about gladiators  correction  this past  the unit  union  3 
[02:06:00]  I'm looking  for detective  day  where is he  party  there's no  time for that  uh-huh  anything else  nothing big  yeah  nothing big  going on  yeah 
[02:06:30]  these apps  are fucking  fantastic  listen to horrid  shit all night  long  death and mayhem  yeah  I uh  yeah I  downloaded a few  of these  um  and  whenever anything  happens around  the country  you can just  pop it up  and listen  it's better  than just  listening to  the news  you know  the news  just has  that's where  they grab  their info  they probably  do but  they can't  confirm it  oh no  no my  point is that  they get the  info from there 
[02:07:00]  but they're way  behind because  then they  eventually get it  to air  yeah because  they gotta  confirm it  I'd much  rather have  the alleged  info  and assume  it's right  yeah yeah  yeah  the alleged  info  I can always  adjust my  thoughts later  right I can  always apologize  if I'm wrong  and if it's  wrong who cares  we're on a  new show  yeah exactly  dick joke  fest  did you read  Jessica Redfield's  uh twitter  earlier was that  the one  yes  yeah uh  just one of the  victims she was  a reporter she's 
[02:07:30]  she's now dead  wow well she was  oh that was  that was accurate  her last four  tweets of course  we're seeing dark  night redheaded  Texan spitfire  people should never  argue with me  maybe I should get  in on those NHL  talks and then  uh someone goes  Jessica you aren't  seeing it tonight  and then she writes  loser and then  uh she uh  writes movie doesn't  start for 20 minutes  yep that's the last  and they're confirming  she's one of the  ones killed  I believe so  yeah I read that  earlier  yes  that's like she  might be a fan of 
[02:08:00]  ours too because  she follows us  what no way  yeah  do most of your  fans follow because  they like you or  because they despise  you do you have  do you have an  element of  of course we do  yeah because I'm  pretty sure based on  some of the  commentary I get  it's like I have  more people that  follow me that hate  just because they  want to respond  like that you know  and then I just  have fun when they  make like grammatical  errors or they  can't complete a  coherent sentence  yeah yeah  you know it's just  you get you get  people that are  obsessed with their  hate for you  hate oh it's great  by the way I think  it's so amusing like  when I have time to  kill with all my 
[02:08:30]  travel schedule like at  an airport and stuff  like that it's just  so fun though like  like they think it  it actually affects  me which is right  yep sort of amazing  so it's it's funny  they do though  they're we we get  we get a few people  like that they usually  have no followers  well they have no  followers because they  just keep making new  accounts  yeah yeah  and they think we  don't know  I just block them  now  it's just so stupid  I don't even really  comment that much  anymore  I just fucking block  them  gone 
[02:09:00]  yeah oh I like to  respond and then block  that way you get the  last word  I do that yeah  yeah  federal state and local  law enforcement agencies  continue to respond to  this because there's  nothing new for now  no no no  by tonight there'll be  a lot of information  about this twat  I just want to see what  they're doing with this  apartment right now  nothing  they keep going back to  that  yeah  you do realize how  fucking out of touch  the newspaper is though  like  of course there's nothing  in the morning's papers  there couldn't be but  it's just you don't even  want to look at it  it makes you wonder like  well like you know I wake up 
[02:09:30]  every morning I read the  post before I go to the  gym it's like I don't  know why I do that by  the time like because  that's what we knew  everything that's in there  I basically know already  yes  why am I reading history  they're close to 24 hours  behind now the paper  and the paper the first  chance they get at this  will be tomorrow morning  how weird is that  by the way who reads  the no you know the  saturday paper isn't  exactly that's true and  that's that'll be their  first chance you know  yeah but I mean people  could go to their  websites sure but it's  done it's like that it's  archaic it's paper stop  well I don't read the 
[02:10:00]  paper that way I only do  it digitally now I mean  yeah I like I know  some people who love  the kind of the feel of  a newspaper for me I  like all my newspapers  on my iPad I can access  it I don't have to fold  it out especially  traveling like you know  exactly sitting there  like this with your arm  extended into someone  else's seat like trying  to read it it's  disaster you have to  know that how to fold  the pages over thing  there's an art to it  and then you have to  redo it every time  every time good fold  you have to unfold  completely to get to  the next page turn the  page new fold have you  been they might have  asked you last time  have you been on your  dad's plane oh yeah 
[02:10:30]  did you guys talk  about that last time  oh yeah okay go ahead  go no I'm just curious  how fucking amazing it  is it's pretty sweet  you know it because  what you know when I  travel I travel commercial  99% of the time I go  coach because you know  we've I travel with  teams of guys like I  you know not everyone's  going business class and  I can't like lead a team  if I'm sitting in  business class and they're  all sitting in coach I  just feel like a jackass  so it's just so much  more painful doing that  kind of travel given that  I travel virtually every  week after having been on  the plane like with my  dad because there you  walk around there's 
[02:11:00]  bedrooms there's you  know movie theaters  oh man how big is his  plane it's a 757 so  he got a 757 it's got a  757 so you know it's a  it's a big plane it's  it's sweet wow you know  it's cool to be able to  you know take my kid or  something like my little  boy you know like take  him up into the cockpit  I'm a pilot myself so you  know I get it but like  you know a three-year-old  kid he's like sitting in  there watching you come in  at night like landing up  it's pretty sweet you know  it's a cool experience  I'd love to sit in a  plane during takeoff and  look out the front window  that's gotta be fucking  cool right you know I 
[02:11:30]  I don't know what the  FMA statutes are because  I'm not quite I'm not  quite rated for that  pilot I'm not sure if  I'm rated for that so I'm  going to go off the  record on that and say  all right well let me  just assume it's probably  fun to you know be able  to get behind the  controls I would imagine  it's fun to fly VFR at  36,000 feet you know it's  a visual flight  rules you know like you  know just sort of using  the horizon as opposed to  instruments and do they  wait do they do that 
[02:12:00]  what's why would they do  that at that height they  wouldn't yeah oh it's  kind of like yeah yeah  flying the old iron  compass but yeah I've  been lucky with my you  know my father's pilots  and stuff back when he  had his other planes 727  before that I used to go  with them when they do  their training and go  into sims yeah you know  and practice landing all  these big planes in a  simulator and it was all  sort of amazing just even  you know heavy 90% of my  experience in like a Cessna  and these smaller planes  you know it's all kind of  the same other than you  know other than the 
[02:12:30]  numbers that you got to  follow so yeah yeah it's  pretty cool why don't we  go to Steve the third  because he calls our show  from time to time he has a  profile on this guy let's  just see let's see what he  says  how's my profile well he  does this for a living  Steve what do you got  buddy  good morning guys  what are you thinking  it's a you know the  story's only a few hours  old but what do you got  the type of person that  that does something like  this is probably got a  diagnosis of either  antisocial personality  disorder which basically  means you you're born and 
[02:13:00]  you're raised without a  conscience whatsoever  you have no capacity to  feel guilt or somebody who  was a high level paranoid  schizophrenic because as  Anthony has probably said  the tactical planning behind  this was a very  sophisticated you're  probably looking at  somebody who's either  bounced out of the  military on a section 8  or for dishonorable  discharge or somebody  who never made it in  so it's clinger  right  yes  remember  the clinger killer 
[02:13:30]  clinger killer yes  in a dress  you're also probably  looking if not the  military somebody who  had aspirations of being  in law enforcement and  couldn't cut it  uh-huh  wow  what about a guy that  might have worked at  that movie theater  I you know what we all  have revenge fantasies  about people who  haven't treated us good  ex-girlfriends former  employers that kind of  response is way over the  top I I would tend to  doubt it  he was assistant to the  assistant manager at the  movie theater  but I made the point  earlier how it was  probably a guy who 
[02:14:00]  didn't get into the  military or the police  department  no you didn't  yeah I did and I  said that he  why are you laughing  with me  no I mean I didn't do  it on air but I just  did it to my friend  in the hall  I did it to myself  yeah yeah  it was all by myself  I did that  oh Jimmy you're a  smart guy I'm not  surprised  thank you  that's very sweet  anything else Steve  that's it guys I'm  punching out  Steve the therapist  calls from time to time  that's his thoughts  when you guys said  Steve the therapist  I wasn't sure if this  was like a you know  an ONA fan type  therapist  right right  that was actually a 
[02:14:30]  pretty well we also  have another therapist  with big huge boobs  and stuff  that's good he says  the guy's crazy  yeah  yeah good thank you  well by the way I  don't want someone with  credibility to go on the  record saying this guy's  crazy because that's  what's going to prevent  this guy from actually  getting the punishment  well that's true  you know what I mean  I actually said that  out in my tweet earlier  like this crazy bastard  I was like man I  shouldn't have used that  word because he's not  crazy he's very he's  disturbed but he's not  crazy because he's got  to get the chair  let him stand trial  death penalty over there  in Colorado  and boy if any case 
[02:15:00]  should get the death  penalty it's it's  something like this  yeah and they'll still  drag it out for months  and they'll bring up  something that happened  in this child you know  the bottom line is this  guy's not a human  and they got him  like they got him  red-handed  we got a witness  stared back and no  one knew how to react  everything was going  good until uh we saw  gas and sparks and  sounded like really  strong fireworks um  and then you just hear  people yelling and  actually just a few uh  rows away from me a  girl gets up holding  her jaw and I guess  she had got shot 
[02:15:30]  overall I gave the  movie two thumbs up  yeah that was uh  exciting  wow  oh man yeah I have  seen a lot of minorities  being interviewed  I've seen a lot of  black witnesses  well that's what I'm  saying and so when I  you know that's all I  saw this morning and  so when you know I  heard 24 year old white  guy go oh boy  that's funny I did not  even notice that until  you said that you're  right though I'm  starting to see a lot  of black witnesses  yeah yeah yeah  because we've been  trained to not be able  to think like that  right  whenever they're  interviewing witnesses  and stuff you just  trying to get the 
[02:16:00]  and plus it was a lot  of voice stuff  yeah I didn't you  didn't even see them  well that's I'm just  saying like you know  even for me like  before I said that I'm  like am I allowed to  say that like you  know you second  guess yourself every  time like if you you  know if you're talking  to me you don't come  here for PC but like I  still like you're so  trained to think that  way like oh you can't  say something like  that but the bottom  line is that could be  one of the motivations  you don't understand  us we only see race  yes we're terrible  people so this Jessica  Redfield who supposedly  died in this in this  attack yeah and she's a  reporter she wrote a 
[02:16:30]  blog about just miss  being in a shooting in  Toronto last month  whoa narrowly escaped  Toronto mall shooting in  June and wrote about  it Jesus yeah she was  a victim of this that's  one of those things you  walk away from one of  them and you're like  that's never gonna  happen to me again  what are the odds  what are the odds  why don't we take a  break what are you  promoting there Donald  Trump jr I'm not  promoting anything I  just say hey you want  to come in I say sure  what the hell just a  friend all right we got  Bob how do you say his

[02:19:00]  the right person I need to  call the police and she's  flying to Colorado from  wherever she lives  Tennessee but I think we  may have found the guy  earlier we may be the  first to have actually  found him on that  they might be that guy  that we saw we maybe  man if I had to  generalize what a killer of  this nature if it is an  attack on the opposite race  do we have audio of her  saying that let's look  for that I wonder if he  left her a message yeah  let's look for that  because that's coming in  on Twitter a lot so it  definitely happened I'm  wondering if there's audio  of her saying that okay

[02:23:30]  is that fun  yeah  listen I'm not going to  quit my day job  but it's sort of a  interesting way to  break up the year  yeah  it's one of those  things I guess  you know being  kind of a real estate  guy I look back  on 20 years  and be like  hey I was like  network TV  for 7 or 8 years  that is pretty cool  when you think about  your life experience  you know it's not  not something I do  it doesn't change  what I  you know just makes  my life a lot harder  during the time  that we're filming  because it's hours  that I'm not doing  what I'm supposed  to be doing  so I gotta go back  and you know  but it's  it breaks it up  it's pretty cool  that's the beauty  of my career  I don't have that  whole hubbub  with TV  to interfere  with the shit 
[02:24:00]  that I'm doing  but watching TV  yeah  that does get  very distracting  that's a lot of fun  you worked with  Bob right  we did it  years ago man  we haven't seen  each other many  we did  me Bob Rich Voss  and Zamuda  as Tony Clifton  it was this weird  thing  where they were  showing outtakes  why were we doing  that what was the  event  it was an  Andy Kaufman  special that they  were showing on TV  or there was  some reason why  it wasn't just  it was like the  10 years  or 20 even 
[02:24:30]  of Andy Kaufman  it was at the  House of Blues  in LA  and they showed  a lot of  Jim Carrey footage  that wasn't in the  movie from  it was right  whenever  Man on the Moon  came out  and then they did  a walk by  Kaufman's house  we went over  to the comedy  store  it was kind of  a weird show  but cool that way  it was a cool one  and I'm a fan  of Jim  he's a funny  funny guy  that was a weird  night  it was a weird  crowd  but it's for  Andy Kaufman 
[02:25:00]  if so  that's what  I was doing  it was perfect  perfect for Andy  I'm jealous  I would have  loved to check  that out  it was my first  time I think  meeting Zamuda  as it got hotter  and hotter  the fucking  Clifton makeup  gets tougher  and tougher  to keep on  and he's doing  it again  he's doing  Clifton  hosting a show  at the comedy  store  he came in  as Clifton  about a year  maybe  it might be  two years ago  was it pleasant  no  it was weird  he's not a pleasant 
[02:25:30]  man  it was very strange  extremely strange  very odd  we enjoyed it  yeah Zamuda's  a weird dude  but I mean  he's managed to  keep that going  for a long time  and it's odd  we all know  Kaufman is fucking  dead  but there is  a part of you  that when this  son of a bitch  sells it  you're like  well  yeah that could  be him  you have like  a little hope  a little hope  right  yeah then it's  just  you realize  it's just  fucking  I love what  they did  with that  I love that  they switched  off who  played the  character  and yeah  it was also  the kind of 
[02:26:00]  comedy that  it seems like  it would fit  in right now  everyone would  understand it  with like  you know  between two  ferns and  stuff  the kind of  rudeness  and but  back then  it was just  nuts  it was nuts  man and he  would do stuff  that people  didn't like  did you see  the Dinah Shore  show appearance  like no  it was great  it was just  great  was it  was it  Coughlin  or  I think it  was Zmuda  and he was  hilarious  yeah  because back  then there was  no alternative  comedy  right  it wasn't 
[02:26:30]  this weird  irony  it was like  you were just  a guy who  they thought  sucked  that was  really ballsy  to fucking  do that  man  to go up  and bomb  on purpose  was a  catch a rising  star  it's not like  it was the  luda lounge  where people  were a little  bit more  tolerant  because they  knew you  were exploring  a certain  mentality  or a certain  thought process  right  this was just  what the fuck  is he doing  the only thing I would say  is different  is I used to go  do stand up  at the improv  here when I wrote  for Saturday Night Live  because I wanted  to get a laugh  once a week  if you didn't believe 
[02:27:00]  that going to the  improv  was not  was the thing  that fed my soul  you know how rough  SNL was  what years were you there  87 to 91  okay  I wrote for  you know  Dennis Miller  and Jan Hook's  time  and then also  Farley  the Farleyers  were  amazing  yeah  yeah  some great  stuff  and  on the wall 
[02:27:30]  they had those  photos  do you remember  did you ever  do that club  the old  improv  I think I went  in there once  it kind of was  before my time  so anyways  on the wall  were these  pictures of  acts  and it was  so weird  because there  were singers  and there  were people  doing  juggling  and then  they explained  to me  that that's  what used  to happen  in a comedy  club  in the 70s  was you have  a comic  a singer  and a specialty  act  in that order  all night long  that's  a variety 
[02:28:00]  show  yeah  like Ed Sullivan  people spinning  plates  weird variety  acts  he had those  spinning plates  in a nightclub  it was always  weird  like I remember  Ed Sullivan  and it was  that kind  of dumb  thing  and the whole  family would  sit and just  be captivated  by somebody  doing some  awful thing  with bouncing  balls  and spinning  plates  and juggling  bowling pins  this is a  party act  right  this is like  a six year  old birthday  party act  and it's on  national television 
[02:28:30]  people interested  in taking the  time to learn  a practice  like that  imagine that  the Beatles  talking to the  plate spinning  guy  doing inkly  well  no one  remembers  that  when the  Beatles  were on  Sullivan  there had  to be  some filler  acts  before and  after  the zoo  keeper  and there  was a guy  that's like  yeah I played  with the  Beatles  on Sullivan  no one  remembers me  that's a funny  moment in  Mr. Saturday  Night  it wasn't my 
[02:29:00]  favorite movie  but there was  a really funny  moment where  Buddy  who is  Billy Crystal's  nightclub guy  who never quite  made it to the  big time  character  comes out  was it before  or after the  Beatles  and he's just  screaming at all  the kids  and he fucking  sabotages his  career  but it was a  very funny  thing to picture  a comedian  having to come  out and  fucking work  with the  Beatles  I just don't  remember if it was  before or after  them  but somebody  else did  you were involved  in Mr. Show  right?  I helped with it  I got in the way  of the camera  David and I 
[02:29:30]  did that  and of course  also Ben Stiller's  show too  that show  why didn't that  show take off?  because it was  because it was  on opposite  60 minutes  oh was it?  it was such a  crazy placement  for that show  Sunday  at fucking  7?  parodies  and definitely  for young people  and it was  opposite 60 minutes  I mean it was  death right away  what channel? 
[02:30:00]  it was Fox  which was just  beginning to have  shows  so you know  you didn't even  know they had  shows some nights  they did have  like a Fox  Sunday  and then like  the rest of the  week it was  the local affiliate  was running  like I Love Lucy  or something  and then they  built it into  a 7 day a week  network  but at the time  you're right  it was like  Fox Sundays  well maybe they  didn't have a lot  of spaces  to choose from  but it really  was not going  to do well  because you know  60 minutes  they already  had you know  all those people  their audience  was people  between 7 
[02:30:30]  and 75  and we had  everyone else  pluck from  yeah I remember  that just being  really a funny  show  very cutting  edge  and comedy  that you  weren't seeing  everywhere else  it was also  pretty weird  I mean you know  people say  I don't know  when people use  the word weird  for comedy  I think sometimes  it means they're  boring  you know  like Mr. Show  I feel like  people talk about  it like it was  weird or whatever  but I don't think  it's weird at all  I mean it's just 
[02:31:00]  the things we're  making fun of  are pretty apparent  if you're watching  it  you can like  oh well that's  a parody of this  and that he's  doing you know  and then I think  the Ben Stiller  show was like  weirder by far  because the pieces  were so such a  strange like mashup  you know Eddie  Munster in whatever  what was it  I can't remember  oh uh Cape Fear  you know and like  where does that  come from 
[02:31:30]  you know  medieval cops  I remember that one  too  it was cool  some funny stuff  yeah  cool  it was you  obviously Stiller  Janine Garofalo  Janine  Andy Dick  oh right right  Judd Apatow  was the producer  jeez  Rob Cohen  Jeff Kahn  you know  David Cross  wrote for the last  like three episodes  I never talked to him  I just gave him shit  he uh  he was in the room  pitching and he was  a new writer right 
[02:32:00]  so he wanted to  get something on  and people were  pitching these  parodies that I  hated  these stupid  you know  mix the titles  together  and  and uh  somebody had  a few good  scouts  and I was like  ugh  and David was like  yeah you could  he was just trying  to cooperate  as a new writer  he was like  I finally got a job  I'm making money  doing comedy  and he's like  uh well you could do  this and you could do  that and I think Judd  said well write it up 
[02:32:30]  and I turned to him  and I said good luck  with that  and he remembers that  forever  how hard is it to  write for a show  like I've never  written for anyone  but myself  and like SNL  is supposed to be  a fucking rough  environment  like a very tough  I don't know what  it's like now  because I think  people are much  nicer now  it seems like  just the vibe  there is much  better than it was  when I was there  and before  I was there  when I first  got there  I couldn't  understand  the coldness  and the kind  of strangeness 
[02:33:00]  and intensity  of everyone  I mean I  was already  intimidated  because it's my  first job  and I'm 25  huge  and then for people  to like pile on  the intimidation  yeah yeah  it was like  what is up here  and uh  and I found out  that everyone  felt that way  about the place  and previous  you know  cast members  everyone I've  spoken to from SNL  has the same story  about how just  awful it was  to work there  yeah and they  wouldn't go up there  I mean I heard  that like  Jane Curtin  said she'll never  set foot on this  floor again 
[02:33:30]  in her life  you know  wow  like wow  really  I thought  wasn't this  a great time  in her life  it looked fine  Daryl Hammond  was the longest  running cast member  and he's been  in nine mental  institutions  that's all you  need to know  right  does it have  the same cachet  today as it  did back then  when it was  a rougher  environment  because you  know I  I kind of  look at it  as like the  ultimate back then  and I know  it's still on  it does though  it does  and also  like I said  I think it's  different over there  now  I think everyone  is nicer to each  other  there's more  people 
[02:34:00]  which somehow  makes it  there's way  more writers  there was like  14 when I was  there  and now there's  like 23  so just  it I guess  your odds went  down to get  something on  but everybody's  kind of in the  same boat  there's so many  people up there  in the same boat  so they're kinder  to each other  it seems  but I think  it does  just because  there's so many  venues for comedy  and it's still  a premier place  my question is 
[02:34:30]  more from the  business side  did like the  aggressive work  environment  actually promote  sort of a better  product than  the happy friendly  I suppose they  probably think  that may be true  that may be true  I don't know  there's so many  Saturday Night Live  alumni that it's like  and all you guys  seem like  it's like  veterans of the  Vietnam  you all have  this like  camaraderie  we made it  through  yeah it is a  really intense  experience  and I  totally  respect to  everyone who  went through  there but the  other thing is 
[02:35:00]  I don't think  people are  deluded when  they go there  now like  oh I'm gonna  be a movie  star  they know  I'm gonna  do this  and it might  work  it might  not pan  out  I'm just  gonna try  to do  the best  I can  with this  so when  I was there  people were  still showing  up going  that's it  I'm done  I'm a  billionaire  I'm huge  was that the  Hartman years  or no  yeah  you were there  for Phil  yeah yeah  I was there  for Phil  you were  brilliant  funny dudes  that was  great people  fucking brilliant  yeah  fantastic  caveman lawyer  it was one of the  great skits of all  the hilarious  Farley is crazy  as everyone says 
[02:35:30]  the stories that  come out  when you say crazy  what do you mean  he's a really sweet  guy  really super sweet  I understand that  but there was one  story about how  he would shit out  the window  yeah  he would do that  that's actually  David Barrett  why is that crazy  let's analyze this  where does your shit  go  touch it down  the toilet  I should explain  I'm a huge fan  of Chris Farley  but  it's crazier  to shit in your  own window  I guess  at least it's out  he kept it  interesting for  everyone  he was youthful 
[02:36:00]  he was very  so depressed  when he passed  man  he had a lot  more to give  he sure did  yeah  and he was a good  actor too  I did Second  City with him  I did the  main stage  with him  he did a few  scenes that  weren't  pure comedy  scenes  they were kind  of dramatic  and he could  have done  anything  his movie work  doesn't show  what he could  have done  and he just  his performance  at Tommy Boy  was brilliant  really  way past 
[02:36:30]  just being funny  yeah  it's a real shame  because my kids  don't really know  who he is  and I showed  him one or two  movies  but he just  didn't stick  around and do  enough  to make  the impact  he should have  made  but he was  the best guy  ever  I loved him  everybody who  knew him  loved him  and of course  you saw it  coming for so  long  it made it  worse  because  for so many  years  everyone was  trying to  help him 
[02:37:00]  and it was  weird because  there was one  time  one party  that I went  to in LA  and I didn't  know he'd be  there  and he wasn't  drinking  and he was  with David Spade  and he wasn't  drinking  and he wasn't  he was totally  on the ground  and doing  great  and I thought  oh my god  he's going  to make  it  I'd never  seen him  like that  I'd never  seen him  so in  control  of himself  and it  was like  a different  person  than I'd  ever seen  so it  made me  really happy 
[02:37:30]  and to  feel like  he did  it  he made  it there  I can't  believe this  because before  that you  just see  Chris  sober  after  you know  rehab  but very  still  you know  kind of  being a  childish  kind of  being  immature  going  yeah  no  no  I promise  yeah  I'm  going  to be  good  but you  kind of  go like  you're  just  saying  that  to me  like  I'm  your  dad  I  don't  want  to  hear  that  I  want  to  believe  it  you know  and I  did  I believed  it  but  I think  he had  a lot  of  temptation  there's  people  who have  a certain 
[02:38:00]  kind  this is  that  one  chance  to have  a beer  with  Farley  I'm  not  going  to  pass  that  up  I  know  he's  supposed  to be  sober  come on  and he's  the big  fun guy  come on  Chris  very approachable 
[02:38:30]  it was really sad  how long after that  did he die  that you said  you saw him  at that  I'd say  it was about  two years  after that  so it was a while  yeah  there's something  about like  there's something  about like  those big fat  guys  who are  like  Gleeson  John Candy  him  Belushi  those guys  also  those really  over the top  fucking  gut funny  fat dudes  that are  great actors  as well  there's a real  there's different  to me than  there's a certain  physicality 
[02:39:00]  they have  that like  you know  smaller guys  don't have  that they bring  like no skinny  guy could do  what Gleeson did  there's something  about his  large breasts  I don't know  it's just the  dynamics of how  they're made up  and maybe  what goes into  making them  big loud  brash funny guys  but usually  they turn to be  fucking like  Candy was a  really good  serious actor  when he did  it  I'm babbling  I'm babbling  when he did  the Chippendale  skit  he was actually  a pretty good  athlete man  that stuff was  amazing  he was a dancer  he could do  anything  he was incredible  I'm looking at 
[02:39:30]  that  he was as good  as Swayze  or whatever  it was in there  with an extra  300 pounds  it was  classic  Breaking Bad  obviously  that's why  you're here  what about  that show  what is with  that show  I've never  seen it  everyone's talking  about it  I'm embarrassed  to say  I haven't seen it  I hear it's  correct  I'm a huge  fucking fan  that's great  man  thanks  no need to  swear  well that's true  I shouldn't use  the blue language  there's no reason  to go blue  satellite radio  yeah 
[02:40:00]  I love it  it's like ham  right  yeah  it's ham radio  sometimes we get  skip  we get skip  and we broadcast  to Europe  yeah  Breaking Bad's  awesome  I mean  it really  it really is  and your character  came in  was it the  second season  end of the  second season  yeah  he had to  he had to  get in enough  trouble where he  needed a lawyer  oh yeah  I guess  that's why  you came in  at that point  the character  is great  we were talking  last night  about  your office 
[02:40:30]  alone  is a character  that office  is hilarious  and God  what is it  behind it  and God  we trust  the constitution  behind you  on the wallpaper  the pillars  it's so pompous  well it's such a facade  I mean everything  when they called me  when Vince  called me  to ask me to do it  which is amazing  that he asked me to do it  you were in mind  when they  like you were the guy  I guess so  wow  that's great  somebody turned it down 
[02:41:00]  some idiot  did they ask you to read for it  or they said we'd like you to do it  that's great  I know  isn't that weird  and I  something  I said so  so tell me about it  and he goes  well it's a  he's a sleazy lawyer  and I go great  that's  I can do that  how hard can that be  and then he goes  his name is Saul Goodman  and he blah blah blah  and I go  whoa whoa whoa  I said I'm  I'm not  I'm not Jewish  you know  my kids are Jewish  and my wife is  but I'm not 
[02:41:30]  and he goes  oh well he's not Jewish  he just  he's Irish  he made that name up  even better  Jewish to the homeboys  you know  because it is great  Saul Goodman  yeah  and I said  oh that's fantastic  right away  and I right away  wanted to do the hair  the  you know  mullet  but  and the comb over  mixed together  but also cleaned up  as much as possible  on the sides  yeah  and  no  no offense  to comb overs  I'm  family tradition 
[02:42:00]  I heard that one  on no less than  millions of occasions  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I make fun of it myself  but karma's a bitch  and I figured  my genetic propensity  towards potential bad hair  I'd rather just not go there  you're lucking out  you've got a great head of hair  you really do  I'm doing okay so far  that's why I don't want to tempt fate  I'll leave it alone  good good  yeah so I  and honestly  you know  Jim I showed up there  I  I would not have been surprised 
[02:42:30]  if they said  Odenkirk  oh that wasn't the name  no  go back home  wrong actor  no I can't believe it  so years later  two years into it  I asked Vince  you know  Vince Gilligan writes the show  and he's the mastermind  of the show  and there's great writers  amazing writers  but  he is the final say  and I think  propels it into  the place that it is  and  I said  so why'd you hire me  is it  because of the Larry Sanders show 
[02:43:00]  because it's  there's some similarities  between the characters  you know  Saul and  Stevie Grant  the agent I played  and  he goes  no no  I missed your show  so  I don't know  I don't know  I'm not going to touch it  I've done it for three years now  and I love it  great situation man  I'm just going to keep going  was  was the character  supposed to be as prevalent  in the show  no  I don't know  you know  because Vince is hard  to scrutinize  you know  but he 
[02:43:30]  he said  you know  initially it was three shows  three episodes  wow really  like Omar from the Wire  was a six  supposed to be on for six  and it just worked  and he became the star  of the show  that's kind of  that's great  people love the character  it's  you're so  the character is so sleazy  he makes wisecracks and stuff  yeah  because for him  like all these characters  that you've been watching  if you watch Breaking Bad  everybody's got a gun to their head  yeah  everybody  yep  everybody  the wife of the guy  who's making the meth 
[02:44:00]  is  you know  scared to death  so he's the one character  who wasn't  in fear  all the time  and he was just  making wisecracks  yeah  it was a big game to him  like how much money  can I make off these  idiot meth cookers  these degenerates  and then now  as the  as the  intensity of the show  has gone up  which is amazing  right  that it keeps going up  you can't believe it  it's starting to  the hot water  is starting to rise up 
[02:44:30]  yeah  you can't be involved  with that many people  that are in that much trouble  and not get your own  hands dirty  yeah  I've only on like  beginning of season three  so don't  don't run it  just tell me  they don't got earmuffs  or something like that  no spoilers  no spoilers  yeah  no  I was lucky enough  to see the first  couple of episodes  before it aired  and that  the first episode  was great  the second episode  of the new season  here  it was unbelievable  just blown away by it  I was saying  how it's  almost like  a movie 
[02:45:00]  that's taken years  because a lot of times  they don't want a character  to change  in a show  yeah  TV shows about not changing  leave Fonzie the way he is  Fonzie is this guy  but like  Walter White  has completely changed  through the whole show  yeah  well that was the  the goal of making a show  where that happened  which is  it's probably happened  once or twice before  I don't know  when though  yeah  but yeah  mostly TV is about  watching the same characters  in the same place  act the same way  it's supposed to be a no-no 
[02:45:30]  to make them change  yeah  you're going to ruin  the formula  but yeah  TV is really changing  with these cable channels  and what they're  trying to do  trying to do  something new  and so that was  Vince's idea  was to watch  Walter White  mutate  and evolve  or devolve  into this evil guy  and believe every step  and understand  why he makes each step  and it happens  so gradually  that it's not like  one week  he's this timid guy  and then the next week  he was this tough guy  well he's always got  a loose screw 
[02:46:00]  that's the thing  that you  as you watch it  you start to understand  that he's got this past  that he's got this  anger and rage  oh he's broken  right from the beginning  Jeff Garland  said to me  because Jeff  like a lot of people  they are  I have people come up to you  when you're on that show  all the time  and go  I never watched it  and then a week  you know  two weeks ago  I watched all of them  I can't believe it  it's like 24 that way  you know what I mean  you sit down  and you're like  oh and you spend  your whole weekend  watching a show  yeah and I think 
[02:46:30]  it's streaming on Netflix  so it's easy to watch them all  so Garland comes up to me  and he goes  I finally watched them all  it's about middle age  it's about being  a middle age white guy  nobody says it  you know  it kind of  you know  if you look at  the character  and how  Walter White's character  and how  much rage  and resentment  he has  you know  I think a lot of  50 year old white guys  are like  yeah I never got my  you know  I never got what's coming to me 
[02:47:00]  he was invisible  he was just a  science teacher  shit on every corner  yeah always shit on  and what's really great  about your interaction  with him  in the beginning  you were shitting all over him  I mean you  you controlled him  like a puppet  and then  now in the  in the last few episodes  that I've seen  from this season  boy does he have  you petrified now  too  you know  he's the boss  yeah  oh what he's capable  of  yeah  exactly  we had him in recently  he's fantastic  Brian described it as 
[02:47:30]  he said when he came up  with the character  and how to make it  he said he wanted him  to blend in  it was really brilliant  he said like  I gave him  these bland colors  so he blended in  and an impotent mustache  and it's all I can think of now  is an impotent mustache  yeah  greatest term  sitting over  with no purpose whatsoever  yeah just nonsense  what a smart  actor thing  to do that  he's great  he's a great actor  and a really great guy  and sets the tone  for that set  and then the  the Emmy nominations 
[02:48:00]  came out  crazy right  yeah  a lot  it's amazing  amazing  I mean  you know  Giancarlo Esposito  is such a great actor  and he's  plays Gus  and he's nominated  and Anna Gunn  is nominated  this year  she's so great  and this year  she's amazing  what's coming up  yeah  so  she looks petrified too  which is great  like  she's in such a spot  that first episode  of this year  I don't want to wreck it  for you  I'll go earmuffs  you know  right at the end  right  I forgive you 
[02:48:30]  yes  that was crazy  and she's like  her face is brilliant  you could hear her going  what  you forgive me  oh man  everyone's just petrified  it's fantastic  yeah  it's a moment  where you're like  I don't know  if I wanted to see  you didn't need to have  a camera in there  then when they said that  did you  did you need to show us that  and it's  it's also a credit  to the show  that a lot of people  when it first came out  weren't watching it  I mean this is built up steam 
[02:49:00]  where people are going back  and getting those first  couple of seasons  and blasting through them  trying to catch up  before you know  the spoilers come out  I can't believe  I get to be on it  it blows me away  and it's an amazing project  I bet  you get recognized a lot  from this  more from this  than anything I've done  you know  I've been doing comedy  you know  Stiller Show  Mr. Show  and all kinds of little videos  because I'm always making stuff  with friends  in LA  Funny or Die 
[02:49:30]  Funny or Die stuff  and you know  but I've done so much  but this is obviously  the biggest thing  by far  in a way  that I've done  yeah  do you have any  clue of where the storyline  is going to go  I'm not even going to ask you  what happens  but I'm just curious  if you know  I won't make it outside  the studio  that's true  we might have to  beat it out of you  you know  it is a darker season  this season  as you can see  but there's some amazing  mind-blowing 
[02:50:00]  stuff that happens  when I read it  you know  you read the scripts  when I get the scripts  you read it  it's just like watching it  you're like  what?  no!  no!  you're kidding me  I mean I call them up  and say  how are you going to do that?  you know  that's got to be fun  it is fun  and then you want to  forget it right away  because you want to  watch it again  and sort of see it  for the first time  do you get the whole  you get the whole script  you don't just get your sides?  the last couple episodes  of the season 
[02:50:30]  they black it out  like a government document  they do right?  yeah they do  because  a script almost got out  like two years ago  I don't know how  but  really?  so they don't want to  take a chance  they don't trust you guys at all  ruin it for everyone  yeah yeah  I kind of  I don't want to know  what's going to happen  especially now that  the end of the  the run is  is kind of  looming  I watch these episodes  like you want to  savor them  they end and you're like  shit there's another one gone  yeah 
[02:51:00]  I definitely say  because I mean I watch it  mostly on like an iPad  when I travel  I save them all up  and so it's like  man there's two more shows  in the season  it's like do I watch it now  and try to grab it all in  or do I like wait two weeks  and just try to get  something more out of it  watch something else  to break it up  I totally get people who go  I can't  I have to wait  till the end of the season  and watch them all  I can't  I can't suffer  through the week  I watch them  when I ever watch anything  I watch it fast  because again spoilers  and the amount  on Twitter  oh these pricks  yeah they'll do  anything on Twitter 
[02:51:30]  yeah so you gotta  get it out quick  whenever I'm doing  something like that  having one of these  marathons of a show  that I haven't  caught up on  I never say on the air  that I'm watching it  because these sons of bitches  don't tell me what happens  on Big Ange  oh damn  this week  don't spoil  Big Ange  I'll get right now  I'm on season two  of Laverne and Shirley  and I want to know  what happens  yeah she blows  the big ragu  yeah I hear there's  a double dildo coming  where the father  catches him in the pizzeria  but I don't want to  I've been watching  the classic sports network 
[02:52:00]  don't tell me what happened  I'll leave Frazier  in Super Bowl 17  hey you had a stand up  background right  it was  I did stand up  I'm not a real  like you're a real stand up  I'm not a real stand up  I just use the stage  for getting up there  and telling jokes  but you did  the second city  no but he does it  for a living  I'm not a real stand  I just build buildings  Jim fights with an audience  see I don't do that  if they don't like me  I go well okay  I gotta go  it's okay 
[02:52:30]  you don't have to like me  I probably don't like you  believe me  if I was a better actor  I wouldn't fight with him either  it's just I have no choice  it's either I'm fucking  not working at all  you gotta go with what you got  yeah  I'd love to be a better actor  that's part of it  you know  is being a real great stand up  like you  is that you get up  in front of people  and you work it  with that crowd  you make it work for you  but you know  it's hard  it's a tough gig  so you know  I just do it for fun  yeah 
[02:53:00]  but I did it  I did it during the comedy boom  when I was starting out  because I always loved sketch comedy  that's always what I wanted to do  and  but you could  if you could write some jokes  you could  get up there and tell them  make some money  remember how crazy that was  I mean I don't know  Jim you came kind of  1990 I started  and I got my first paid gig  like April of 91  I missed  I was on the tail end of the boom  when it was kind of bottlenecking  a little bit  would you bamboozle for that  paid gig  I was  Dennis Ross and 
[02:53:30]  Jim Florentine  oh okay  got my first paid gig  yeah  wow damn  yeah 91  because I do remember when  I mean there were  on any Friday and Saturday night  there were so many comedy shows  on television  just  they couldn't find enough clubs  to pop a camera on  in front of that brick wall  and just  it was  comic after comic  in Chicago  it was like  it was like  there were two clubs  and then  two years later  there were  like twelve  yeah  like you know  these chains 
[02:54:00]  they would open  chains of them  like Zaney's  had like three locations  and  one of those  is close too  Zaney's  and  Vernon Hills  close  two of them  yeah  and quantity  did not mean quality  no no it didn't  wow  and every disco  had a  like used to be disco  had a comedy night  but you know  you could pick up 50 bucks  and it was better than  wait and table  that hurt a lot of comics too  like a lot of guys  who might have been much funnier  start headlining  before they were ready  because there were so many  headliner spots available 
[02:54:30]  and then in 1993  94  95  they just  they weren't good  at writing material  so they were doing  the same shit  a lot of those guys  had been phased out  and probably would have  been better acts  if they had been forced  to fucking work  their way through it  they had to just  trying to fill up  so many god damn  comedy clubs  it was so crazy  yeah it was nuts  back then  you can't do it  like you can't just  it's not like opening  a disco  where you just play  the top songs  and everyone can play them  you need to get  these guys to show up  and have material  entertain a crowd 
[02:55:00]  so it was really  some lame lame  comedy  I find sketch  to be harder  because like  I've watched  I've never seen  Second City Live  excuse me  but I've gone to UCB  and when Amy Poehler  went in one night  and what a masterful  improver she is  she's fucking  brilliant at it  and it's like  improv is either  really really horrendous  or it's fucking art  well you know  if you're gonna do it good  the people who do it well  they do it all the time  you know  they get their head  into this space  I've seen some  great improvisation 
[02:55:30]  I'm not a great  improviser  I've done it  but I've seen  some great stuff  and UCB guys  are the top notch  people  some of the people  who do like  ASCAT and stuff  you know  like Besser  and Amy Poehler  and Matt Walsh  but then you're right  a lot of  improv is terrible  but sketch  to me  he was writing sketches  and then putting them up  yeah  I love that  Monty Python  and early Saturday Night Live  and Second City TV 
[02:56:00]  those were the things  oh you guys  I'm sorry  were you guys  more improv or sketch  were you guys  were you doing improv  too mostly  I did improv  because that's where  you do it  in the same place  where you would do  a sketch show  but I was always more  for let's go write this  and try to make it good  and improvisation  to me  was a way to get there  but I always  was skeptical  of improv  and still am  a little  when they're really good  at it  when people do it  two times a week  for three years  or more  some people do  they get to this place 
[02:56:30]  where their head  is just  they're making connections  the Groundlings  is amazing too  in LA  the alumni Groundlings  the guys  who've been just  doing it for years  and that can be  that can be mind-blowing  because everything  ties up  and it's funny  and how did you do that  it's hard to grasp  yeah  but yeah  but a lot of improv  is just people  being clever  on stage  and being scared  and everyone  everyone laughs  because they're all 
[02:57:00]  worried for you  it's just weird  so we'll get together  and we'll worry  and then if anybody  says anything  remotely clever  we'll all be thrilled  laughing very hard  laughing at the cleverness  instead of  like maybe  sometimes it would  deserve a  like a nod  but it gets a laugh  I still find it scary  because I just know  I would find crutches  and just lean on them  constantly  it's very difficult  to do  well  stand-up  is a scary thing  yeah  chip's a great example 
[02:57:30]  stand-up seems petrifying  to me  stand-up is a scary thing  because of the audience  though  I mean  you get some  really rough  audiences in stand-up  yeah but you can attack them  you can't attack the camera guy  or the fucking writers  when you're doing  when you're bombing  in a scene  it's horrible  because you're stuck in it  I just gotta keep  forcing out my dialogue  stand-up  you can go  wherever you want to go  and like  you can own it  I can say I stink  this crowd blows  I'm terrible  you can acknowledge it 
[02:58:00]  it's much more  fucking  yeah it's much easier to me  than acting  is fucking hard man  yeah it looks it  yeah you're stuck  in a scene  you can't get out of it  how did you feel  when you got this part  is this like your first  really dramatic  kind of  even though there's  a comedic element to it  is this really  the first kind of  dramatic role  yeah I guess so  yeah  did you have any  reservations about it  no no no  oh you know  the only thing about it  is you know  in comedy  it's  comedy is back and forth  you say two lines  and the other person 
[02:58:30]  says two lines  and this  my character  is kind of a  motor mouth  and he runs  runs off  and so I have  these long monologues  and I  I wasn't going to  memorize it  because I was used  to comedy scripts  and you get  the blue pages  which is the rewrite  like three days  before you go  shoot it  right  and anything  long in comedy  gets cut down  to two lines  right  yeah I can't  help you today  here's the door  and  so I didn't 
[02:59:00]  memorize it  because I was like  well they're going  to shorten this  all I'm  I mean  essentially  what my character  is saying here  is I can help you  so I'll just  say that  verbatim right  yeah they changed  like a date  they changed  like the word  Tuesday to Wednesday  and that was it  and everything else  you've memorized  so that was kind of  strange  it's such long things  but long passages  but then as I  studied them  I started to really  get the characters  like how he 
[02:59:30]  how his mind works  and so there was  something going on  in there  and yeah it's new  it's a challenge  for me  yeah  and I am really  enjoying it  and yes  it comes off  it comes off  very well  I mean  I can't  I couldn't imagine  anybody else  doing that part  you've really  owned it  as an actor  definitely  well thanks  yeah  I'm lucky  is there anything  hard for you  I always ask this  to guys who  are good actors  like what's hard  for you to play  like is there  like one that's  like that like  that emotion is hard 
[03:00:00]  or that type of a  scene is difficult  I don't think  I could cry  you know  some actors  can cry  it's nuts  I did a movie  called Melvin  Goes to Dinner  and it's  Annabelle Gurwitch  is in it  and she had a scene  where she cries  and she just cries  yeah  and every time  every time you do it  tears come  flowing out of her eyes  a lot of actors  can't put the tears out  like you'll see them  like they do the crying face  but you're like  your face is dry 
[03:00:30]  they just do that  they just wince  your face is dry  cries with a dry face  she just cried  like what is that  how do you do that  she's like  oh it's acting  no I think  that's something  screwy in the head  you're always  on the brink of crying  you're constantly  on the brink of crying  if she thinks  her boyfriend's  not listening  during a discussion  that fucking  comes out  she starts crying  yeah she's always  gotta hold it back  yeah so  I don't think  I could do that 
[03:01:00]  but otherwise  I think it's a woman thing  yeah  I think they have  the ability to do that  much easier than men  yeah perhaps  I don't know  I've seen guy crying  guy crying in movies  and TV shows  it's pretty amazing  Demi Moore has a great  teardrop  Denzel  won him the Oscar  in Glory  it's like you know  he's just standing  there getting whipped  and the fucking tear  just drops  I think the single tear  the single tear  on the not crying face  is more  has more impact  than the  the goofy cry face  yeah  like to be Moore  just stood there  and one tear  in Ghost 
[03:01:30]  Ghost  just fell out of her eyeball  you're like holy shit  that's fucking amazing  yeah  yeah  well sometimes  you do that  with mentholatum  yeah  they put the fan  with the menthol  in your face  they blow  in your eye  through one of those  menthol inhalers  you know  oh shit  and then just before  they say action  or they say action  and somebody blows  through that  into your eye  for like  10 seconds  and then  gets out of the frame  and then  tears  come out  but that's 
[03:02:00]  different  I can do that  yeah  I could react  to an injury  that's what you're doing  yeah  I'm injured here  this is painful  yeah I don't know  but I really think  that one Denzel Washington  oh he did it in X too  when he met  Elijah Muhammad  he fucking dropped  a tear  a couple of tears  and it was  really intense  because like  there was no  blubbering  lead up to it  it was a deadpan face  and then  there was no indication 
[03:02:30]  well I believe  that's how I would  ruin it  I would go  get me a tissue  like I would really  fucking let the audience  know it was coming  cut  you're not supposed  to say tears coming  and look at the  front camera  it's Jim Cut  North  yeah 50 take idiot  I tend  are you better on  I tend to do better  as the takes go on  like  like Louie's fun  to shoot with  because he works  like a comic  but some guys  are better in the  first  what do you mean  he works like a comic  does he  he's okay with  fucking around a little bit 
[03:03:00]  like a stand up  because he's in charge  so whatever  like he'll go  alright let's just do it  and then like  we'll play with a line  a little bit  or I'll add something  or he'll add something  he's fine doing that  as a stand up  no I don't change anything  by the way  people  because I've done  so much comedy  and because Saul Goodman  is funny  they say  so you improvise  a lot of that  I don't improvise anything  it's all written  not a single word  no  that's even more impressive  don't stray  I really learn it  verbatim  yeah  and do it verbatim 
[03:03:30]  well the writing  is so good on that show  you know  it's kind of fun  to do that too  because that's where  you really go  so how do I get  from this thought  to this thought  and it's like  it's neat  to do something new  I mean I'm  50 this year  and you know  people don't often  let you do something  very different  from what you've done  yeah  when you get older  so it's cool  to have this opportunity  I'm enjoying it  it's also  obviously it's being written  but you have to 
[03:04:00]  deliver the lines  and you can't just do it  deadpan straight face  there's inflections  and facial expressions  and body movements  and you do play  a great sleazy lawyer  I just dig through it  and kind of follow  his train of thought  and ask myself  what he's thinking about  and one thing I also do  is you know  Robert Evans  the famous film producer  yeah  The Kid Stays in the Picture  great book  and the best  book on tape ever 
[03:04:30]  book on tape  really  never experienced  a book on tape  oh it's so awesome  because he's got  this incredible  you know Robert Evans  right  yeah  yeah I know  and he's got this  he's got this  crazy  like  up and down  to his voice  and  he's always saying  did I do the right thing  no  would I do it again  in a heartbeat  it's like a sing song thing  and it  the pacing changes up 
[03:05:00]  and  he's just really fun  to listen to  yeah  so I always do  all my lines  as him  a couple times  before I go out there  oh wow  just because  he's able to do  like a monologue  and you want to hear  the whole thing  and he puts like  do I think that's  a smart move  not in a billion years  you know  it's just this  crazy  rhythm-y thing  and  I think it maybe  helps me to  be more entertaining  in those 
[03:05:30]  those long  I've heard  they told us  we have to wrap up  I guess  I don't know if you have  that pressure on  no we got a special  we're running  oh we do  yeah your  your comical  when does that start  right now  really  to be honest with you  hey do you know  do you know  Fred Willard  at all  I do know Fred  do you like him  more now today  than you did yesterday  I know I do  I saw Fred  only a few weeks ago  we did a Garland's movie  Jeff Garland's movie  a few weeks ago  and he was so funny  he's fucking hilarious 
[03:06:00]  man  he's really funny  and he didn't jerk off once  not once  that you're aware of  now look  I gotta ask you something  first of all  I don't go into  porn theaters  and this is  old people need to learn  how to use the internet  right  of course  he missed the first  half of our discussion  he needs a modem  you gotta buy him a modem  shouldn't you be arresting  people who are  in porn theaters  not jerking  what are they doing  exactly  those are the creeps  what a creepy person  why are you in there  not jerking off  playing words with friends 
[03:06:30]  yeah that is a little bit  creepier  I don't know  what he was doing  or I don't care  I don't want to know  I can't believe this  people are talking  about this  in this day and age  he's hilarious  PBS fired him  those shitheads  even if he was  jacking off  he's not  he's not  he's doing it  in the right place  it's a good citizen  that's what you should  do in the right place  it's home in front of  your computer  by the way  jumping along  selling weird old  combinations of  old TV shows 
[03:07:00]  so weird  PBS  and they get this  brilliantly funny dude  this relevant guy  who's been in so many  great things  and they shit can him  because he behaves  like an adult  in an adult establishment  if it happened even  he's saying it didn't happen  I'm hoping for his sake  it actually didn't  just because I'm sure  he's embarrassed  well I don't care  either way  I don't want to hear  any more about it  it's just so  you know what I mean  it just shouldn't be  reported  it shouldn't happen  leave people alone  if they want to go in there  I don't care  yeah I'm sure 
[03:07:30]  you know  back in the old days  well it's you know  the new 24 hour news cycles  I'm sure Clark Gable  maybe at some point  wanted to spank one out  in a movie theater  and they left him alone  oh my god  news today is a little different  there's so much stuff  that's irrelevant  to real news  you gotta fill it up  I remember one time  jerking off in a porn theater  on my way home  from a gig  I was  this is way back  when they existed  on Route 130  and you'd always have to  sit in a corner  away from everybody  because guys sit together  when they want to fuck around  but I would always  be off to myself  and I remember 
[03:08:00]  just a fucking  you could kind of see  in the upper corner  a bunch of guys  were lining up  in front of some dude  who was blowing everybody  and I had to leave  that was the first time  I was where poppers  were used  so you saw  I saw the guys breathing  and I'm like  I gotta get this  this is too fucking  even for me  it was too creepy  like a movie  because I didn't want  to be watched  jerking off  I believe  I'm a hero  when I walk into  those places  I fucking sashay in  and all eyes are on me  so I left  yeah I'm dishing  how about the fact  that at his age 
[03:08:30]  he's  yeah  just going to town  it's good to know  it's fantastic  he still had those urges  that's fantastic  and he was in the right place  for an older guy  obviously yeah  he's gotta learn  that you can stay home  and do that  so maybe he lost PBS  maybe he'll get  pick up  pick up some  yeah some fucking  pay-per-view  heart-on medication  for old people  exactly  the posty vac  I love the guy  yeah  he's fucking hilarious  he doesn't change a thing  he's giving us years 
[03:09:00]  of great entertainment  leave him alone  let him do what he wants  I just wanted to know  if you knew him  and were familiar  with the story  he's a great man  real sweet guy  and so are you Bob  thanks for coming  thanks for having me guys  great and bad Sunday  at 10pm on AMC  great show  I definitely suggest  you catch up  very quickly  and then watch  Sunday's episode  are you active on Twitter  it's MrBobOdenkirk  O-D-E-N-K-I-R  I think you have  three tweets sir  yeah I know  I don't know what  I'm not gonna be involved
