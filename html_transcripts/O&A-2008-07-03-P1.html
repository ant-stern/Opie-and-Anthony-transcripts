<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a visit from Patty, a Starbucks employee, who brought Opie a coffee gift.  The hosts launched into a barrage of crude and sexually suggestive comments about Patty's appearance, weight, and perceived menopause, escalating into insults targeting her body, ethnicity, and flatulence.  They jokingly threatened to shave her head, leading to Patty claiming an asthma attack.

The show then abruptly shifted to clips from Larry King Live featuring John Mark Carr, accused of child sexual abuse. Opie and Anthony unleashed a tirade of extremely offensive language and graphic descriptions of the alleged crimes, criticizing both Carr and Larry King's interview style.

This transitioned into segments from Dateline's "To Catch a Predator," detailing the arrests of several men ("South Bay Guy 310," "Jazzman04," and "Six Pack So Cali") who attempted to meet minors online.  The hosts described the conversations and arrests with graphic detail and offensive language, interspersed with listener calls and crude jokes, including a discussion about the size of an apple fritter, followed by a prank call to Starbucks featuring a racist impersonation.  Further "Predator" clips were played, along with promotional advertisements and more vulgar commentary.  The  show also included audio clips from a Dateline NBC episode focusing on internet predators,  highlighting ludicrous excuses and actions of the perpetrators.  The hosts interjected with jokes and commentary throughout these clips.

The broadcast then moved to a discussion of a Sting performance on XM Radio, criticized and mocked by the hosts and callers for its unorthodox choices and deviation from his Police work.  This segued into a segment featuring in-studio guest Pat Twitchell and his consumption of Almond Joys.  The hosts initially discussed Sting’s performance and XM's efforts to secure him, then played a game guessing country song themes, revealing their limited country music knowledge.  A Phil Gordon XM radio advertisement highlighting their programming schedule, including Tom Petty, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and July 4th programming, was aired.

Twitchell's Almond Joy consumption became the central focus.  After revealing he’d consumed four Red Bulls, his agent called in, sharing a childhood anecdote about Twitchell's Almond Joy obsession, leading to a challenge: Twitchell had to eat Almond Joys until he vomited. The segment detailed his multiple vomiting episodes, his emotional reactions, and his childhood trauma related to Almond Joys.  The hosts, guests, and callers provided commentary as Twitchell continued consuming the candy despite vomiting, with photos of his condition reportedly uploaded online.

A discussion about global warming ensued, with Anthony exhibiting skepticism towards the issue, while studio guest Steve passionately argued for its importance.  The debate included humorous tangents about SUVs and hybrid cars, and a call from Davis Guggenheim, director of *An Inconvenient Truth*, followed by further discussion about global warming's various aspects.  Frequent promotional segments for XM Radio programming, including sports and music shows, were included, along with mentions of JBL (John Bradshaw Layfield) from the WWE as a later guest.

Finally, the show tackled a list of the "50 most depressing songs of all time" from the book "I Hate Myself; I Want to Die".  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton discussed and played excerpts from several songs including "People Who Died," "Hurt," "Sister Morphine," "Strange Fruit," "D.O.A.," "Seasons in the Sun," "Honey," "Cats in the Cradle," "The Shortest Story," and "The Christmas Shoes."  The discussion was filled with sexually explicit and offensive tangents, misogynistic, homophobic, and antisemitic slurs, graphic descriptions, and comedic banter.  Multiple listener calls, including one criticizing the show's quality, and commercial breaks with sports commentary and XM radio announcements punctuated this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's absolutely awful.  What's Patty doing here?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  What the hell does she want?  Hopefully eating some cake.  Oh, well, it's your birthday, Opie.  When has a year ever gone by where Patty hasn't recognized your birthday?  I bet it's something from Starbucks.  Ugh.  Because she'll always get you something from the place she works at.  Look at this nervous asshole.  All right, come on in, E.T.  Bring in the needy waste.  Oh, look at how big her ass is getting. 
[00:00:30]  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Hi, Braless.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's not the birthday gift I was looking for.  Nice nips.  You never wear bras, right?  No.  No, I don't have anything to push off.  Dirty.  Don't need to cover my dirty pillows.  Is it cold in here?  Ugh.  She's just looking at you, Opie.  You look so good today on your birthday.  Her nips are hard.  Get that PalTalk camera on her nips there.  Wow.  I heard you were quite a dirty girl at the party.  Yeah, filthy whore. 
[00:01:00]  Stripper dick all over your glasses.  I heard Patty was quite the naughty one.  Just place it right there, E-Rock, so they get a full view.  A gander, Ope.  A gander.  Take a gander at those birthing nipples.  Ugh.  Oh, wow.  They are popping out.  Those are perfect for a hungry mouth.  Oh, my God.  A hungry baby mouth.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking more maybe a hungry bear.  Disembowel her.  No. 
[00:01:30]  No, of course not.  No.  Patty, your torso is making a cartoon face.  I would have named a cartoon character when I can't think of one right now.  But people are threatening to cancel their PalTalk accounts.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Patty, what do you want me to do?  What did you bring, Ope?  Oh, you're a fancy person.  I know you like Starbuck.  Anthony's the fancy person.  I've never said I was a fancy person once on the show. 
[00:02:00]  Jimmy's fancy.  I'm fancy.  Jesus, gut.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Patty, what's going on?  You've gotten a gut in the past, like, week.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Like, look, you sit down, you've got a big gut.  You used to be skinny all over.  And you were in proportion because you were skinny all over.  But now your top half is skinny, and your bottom half wobbles, but it don't fall down.  Which I don't understand.  Is it the menopause?  I have no idea.  I have no idea whatsoever. 
[00:02:30]  You're collapsing onto yourself like a fucking, like a star.  But the thing is, I don't eat any more than I do.  Actually, I eat less, and I walk more, so I don't understand it.  Your metabolism is probably slowing down because of your menopause, and you're probably getting  to the point where you can't, how many cricket wings can you bring back to the ant hole per day?  Not even one.  Yeah, you're kind of filling out at the bottom.  I don't mean to. 
[00:03:00]  Are you exercising at all?  I am.  I do a lot of walking.  I walk all the way from Midtown to the boat, and then all the way through to my friend's  house about four miles from the boat.  So I don't understand it.  Oh, there's two free coupons in there for frappuccinos.  Coupons?  Listen, there's two free what?  Coupons.  Coupons.  Yeah, they're for banana.  We have a new banana frappuccino.  Where the fuck are you from that you talk like that? 
[00:03:30]  Staten Island.  Does everyone in Staten Island talk like that?  Because if they do, I swear it should be a nuclear test ground right now, immediately.  Patty.  Start aerial bombing of Staten Island.  What are these?  Frappuccino coupons.  Coupons.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't like frappuccinos.  I know.  Oh, God.  Obie, you ripped up her.  But I do like the coffee.  Oh, I know. 
[00:04:00]  Coffee's really good.  Yeah, I like it.  What is that brand?  No, I will use the coffee.  Oh, definitely.  All right.  What type are they?  One is the New Guinea coffee.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm Italian.  No.  But that's the name of it.  You know, I don't like the derogatory terms for Italians you're using.  That's not.  Let's say it's the new Italian coffee.  You don't have to say New Guinea coffee.  You can only drink it after you pass somebody money under your white fedora. 
[00:04:30]  No.  In 1910.  Geez.  Do you have the recent Kuhn brand, too?  Yeah.  No.  Extra dark.  You're racist.  Patty's a racist.  I am not.  It's just the name of the coffee.  What's that?  Papua.  I should have just said the Papua part.  You got any old Jew espresso?  New Guinea.  Did you blast another fucking fart?  No, I didn't.  Holy shit.  I don't have it yet.  Jimmy Norton.  I cannot believe the stink.  I don't have it yet.  I can't help it.  The cake does it. 
[00:05:00]  I don't have it yet.  Patty, you smell it?  I don't have it yet.  You're at ground zero over there.  I don't have it yet.  I don't have it yet.  It should be wafting over any minute now.  I don't have it yet.  Oh, Patty's gut is making me happy.  Patty, what's going on?  Lift your shirt up and let me see your gut.  Stop trying to suck your gut in.  Yeah, you can't.  Look at.  No, no.  You're sucking it in.  Ew.  Let it out.  Relax.  Relax.  Is that a mosquito bite?  What bit you?  Ew.  Relax yourself.  My cat scratched me during the night because she was rolling over.  Lift it up.  Why don't you give opiate butter?  You ought to put more peanut butter on it so it doesn't stray off onto your stomach. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, Patty, why don't you give opiate birthday well?  No, it's okay.  Give a birthday well.  He's already seen it.  I know, but it's special.  Why?  Give a birthday well.  No, Jimmy.  No.  Come on, Patty.  Give a birthday well.  Show those luscious cans.  He doesn't want to.  No, I don't want a wow.  Yeah, Patty.  I don't want it.  You show those lovely bosoms.  I don't want it.  I don't.  I don't have any.  I don't want it. 
[00:06:00]  I don't.  Nah.  You don't have any.  Well, Patty, you're getting better with the gifts.  I like some of them.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome.  I like the coffee, the frappuccinos, you know.  You can still turn them in.  Now.  Close at both hands.  Now listen close.  Now listen close.  Here's the next thing that's going to happen.  What?  Get the fuck out.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  But, but.  I'm so tired of her.  Whenever you hear us in here broadcasting. 
[00:06:30]  Whether you don't hear us broadcasting.  No matter what you hear us doing.  When we're here, we're working.  Hear that, Patty?  Yeah.  No.  That means get the fuck out of the state.  What's the matter?  All right.  You can stay.  Okay.  Take a seat.  Pull it out, Kenny.  I feel bad for her.  Take a seat.  No.  Take a seat.  I feel bad for her.  No.  Patty, I feel bad for you.  Aw. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  That sounded like something that gurgled from the La Brea tar pit.  It probably left a mark in your underwear the same.  A tar pit stain.  The last gasp of a stegosaurus.  Blurp.  All right, Patty.  Patty, that was very nice of you.  Okay.  It was thoughtful.  Thanks for dressing in perhaps the worst outfit a human has ever put on.  How high up do your pants go, William Frawley? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  They don't go that high.  They're still below the belly button?  How is that possible?  Here's the problem because she's getting chubby in the legs.  She always looks like she's wearing horse riding pants.  Yeah.  That's what she looks like.  She looks like a motorcycle cop.  The thing is, I don't even eat.  Shut up, chips, buddy.  Well, that's the problem.  You've got to eat during the day.  You've got to eat a lot of cake.  Just keep your metabolism going and it'll burn the fat because that's what it does.  Your lips are grass thin and you still have chapped lips. 
[00:08:00]  How did you do that?  Weather.  What's up with the hair, too?  What do you mean?  You're not using a good shampoo.  No, your hair is very dry.  Are you using like dish soap or something?  Like liquid dish soap?  No.  No, I use Therma Silk.  Yeah, well.  There's nothing silky about that.  It's fucking awful.  Therma Straw?  You sure it doesn't say that on the bottle?  Therma Brick.  The shirt, it's not Therma.  Why don't you try to moisturize a little bit like you put some conditioner in after? 
[00:08:30]  I save a little money by making my own soap.  I take some lye.  I render some fat.  Do you buy regular brand name stuff or do you just kind of borrow ivory for everything?  Your head.  I go to Dwayne Reed for everything.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's a great endorsement for Dwayne Reed right there.  Yeah.  Do they sell cyanide in the pharmacy section?  Oh, thank you, Anthony.  Oh, please.  I got an oh, please.  Step back. 
[00:09:00]  Talk to the hint.  Yeah, that's looking good.  It is getting a little dumpy.  We're going to shave your head again, I think.  No.  And you start over.  Yeah, Patty.  No.  Yeah.  You know, when we shave...  Grab her!  Grab her!  When we shaved your head, you had a much better attitude.  Yeah, close the door, Kenny.  Yeah, close the...  Get the clippers out.  Yeah, close the door.  Get the clippers.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Time to shave your head.  No, I don't want that. 
[00:09:30]  That's all right.  You'll get used to it.  It's my birthday gift.  There's the wig.  It's my birthday gift.  Get used to...  Oh, boy.  Patty.  Yeah, Patty's going to...  Patty's going to open the door.  I don't want my head shaved.  Here it comes.  It's my birthday gift.  It's our...  It's Obie's birthday gift to himself.  I don't want that.  No.  To fire it up.  You hear that, Patty?  No.  We got a wig for you.  I don't want that.  No.  Can we get a mic over there?  No.  Get a wig over that.  Here it comes.  Here it comes. 
[00:10:00]  Here it comes, Patty.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that.  No.  But we do.  No, I don't.  It's my birthday gift.  I can't.  This is a wig.  You'll look pretty in the wig.  I don't want that.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:10:30]  No.  Happy birthday, dear old bitch.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  Stop thinking of yourself, Patty.  Think of others.  You're a selfish bitch.  Your whole life is one act of you, you, you.  No.  Will you undo the wig here and everything? 
[00:11:00]  She's out of reach because you didn't undo the cord.  No.  Undo the cord there, Danny.  There we go.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear old bitch.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  Take the hair.  No.  No. 
[00:11:30]  No.  No.  No.  I don't want you to see it.  No.  No.  She's crying.  Please.  Please don't.  She's begging for her hair.  Please.  Her hair's awful.  Is this the best present ever?  Ever.  Hey, you want to get that hair off?  Just break it like spaghetti.  Holy shit.  Look, I got to. 
[00:12:00]  I can't.  I got to.  What?  What?  All right.  Calm down.  I'm getting an asthma attack.  All right.  Calm down.  No R in asthma, stupid.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Yeah, don't upset her anymore.  Sit down.  I got to get my inhaler.  Okay.  Give it.  Let her get her inhaler.  Hey, let her out.  She's got to get her inhaler.  Yeah, let her get her inhaler.  Carrie, she's got to get her inhaler.  Go inhale.  Don't.  I like the healthy Patty better.  She can take so much more abuse.  Fat asthmatic.  There she goes.  She's getting her inhaler.  She's struggling.  Is she okay? 
[00:12:30]  Make sure she's fine.  Here she goes.  She's fine.  Doing her primatine mist.  Stupid little bird lungs closing.  Get her back in here.  No more with the clippers.  She just did her inhaler.  Do you think she wants some cake?  Patty, get back in here.  You all right?  You did your inhaler?  Let's make sure she's okay.  She just wants some cake.  Sit down.  She just wants some cake.  Sit down over there.  Take a seat and relax.  Are you all right?  You took your inhaler.  Are you okay? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  You get your asthma.  Okay.  All right.  Don't.  Let her sit.  Jackass.  You all right?  Did you think we were going to cut your hair off?  You scared me.  I got scared when I saw that cake.  Yeah.  Cakes are scary.  Grab that cake.  Grab that cake.  All right.  All right.  Take a deep breath.  Slow breath.  Slow.  I'm okay.  Let's go to Sean.  Slow breath.  Just relax.  You're in a little coffee.  Just relax.  Let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.  Sean? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I hope you've been across you and see if you can set up a broadcast from prison tomorrow  for assaulting the retard.  All right.  If we kill Patty.  All right.  John in New York.  John.  It's going to be trouble.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I just want to say that the entire thing just sounded like a rape.  She just kept saying no and she didn't like it.  She just kept screaming to you guys.  You guys just kept laughing at her.  It sounded like a Stephen King freaking movie or novel.  It was a little horrific.  Happy birthday to me.  How does the inhaler work for you?  Good?  Yeah.  It's taking effect. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Now you can just relax.  You're breathing?  Yeah.  You're relaxed?  Yeah.  Good.  Very good.  Well, breathe this.  That's Opie's inhaler.  I'm between dueling, farting fucks.  It's the ice cream cake.  Doesn't it just...  It's unbelievable.  It gives you a sour stomach.  Uh-oh.  What's that?  Oh, not good.  Let's see.  Who is it?  Elo?  Anthony, did I tell you that I used to get nervous when I would accept an award when I 
[00:14:30]  was young?  Yes.  You told me that through your ass, Jimmy.  Anthony, the way it would just fart.  I would get nervous.  Here's a...  Here's a...  I just want to replay what Patty just said for the people that just might have missed it.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car. 
[00:15:00]  You are a whiny.  You do get a little whiny there, Patty.  Hi.  This is Patty, known as Stalker Patty.  Well, you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's hot.  This is an emergency broadcast.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Tom Petty is the host every Thursday on XMX.

[00:16:00]  I'm Adrienne Mitchell from XM Channel 130, POTUS 08.  Did Senator McCain rough up a Sandinista during a diplomatic mission to Nicaragua in 1987?  Mississippi Republican Senator Thad Cochran told the story to a home state newspaper  that he got mad at the guy, grabbed him by the collar, and snatched him up.  Senator McCain, with a translator in Cartagena, Colombia, says it never happened.  I must say I did not admire the Sandinistas very much.  I said that he did not admire the Sandinistas. 
[00:16:30]  There was never anything of that nature.  It just didn't happen.  Asked why Cochran is telling the story now, his spokeswoman says it's to make the point  that Senator McCain used to have problems with his temper, but doesn't now,  and that he's the best candidate for president.

[00:19:30]  It's the worst.  I hope he had an enemy.  I like my penis.  How about John Carr?  Yeah, let's go to John Carr.  Give him some John Carr.  Let's talk about John Mark Carr.  What do you say?  What do you say, Dan?  Some John Mark Carr?  Here's John Mark Carr on Larry King Live last night.  What took you to Thailand?  Well, I'd been traveling for a few years outside the United States.  You were a teacher, right?  Yes.  I was a second-grade teacher.  I was beginning my one-year contract at a very prestigious international school in Bangkok. 
[00:20:00]  I won't mention the name out of respect for the school.  Have you ever had any problems with children?  No.  Absolutely not.  All those stories were false.  There's so much, Larry, that was false.  That you could tell me.  You never had a problem.  There's so much.  Okay.  So much that's false.  You never bothered a child, I think?  No.  Bothered.  Absolutely not.  I've protected children.  I've been...  You ever give a kid garlic up the ass?  You ever make it look like his assholes leaking Welch's grape juice? 
[00:20:30]  You never bothered a child.  Bothered.  Well, is that what you're called?  Yeah.  Is that what you're called fucking anal rape?  Excuse me, son.  Why are you having 30 stitches put into your anus?  I was pestered.  Pestered.  The man pestered me.  He was burdensome.  Uncle Johnny bothered me.  He was bothering me.  Is that what you call removing memories?  A mere bother? 
[00:21:00]  You never bothered, children.  When someone taps you on the shoulder, that's a bother.  Yeah.  When they put your terrified face into a pillow and make your hiney feel like the sun is being  put into it.  Yeah.  Playing keep away.  That's bothering a kid.  Yes.  Not...  Not...  Yeah.  Shoving your dick in his face.  Yeah.  Making him kiss it.  You bothersome.  Yeah.  By the way, Chester's liver from Wackbag.  Yes.  John Markar is a fruit. 
[00:21:30]  Fruit.  He is a fruit.  I've been a teacher for it.  This is my 10th year of teaching.  I still call myself a teacher.  I've had...  I've heard that some people say, well, he'll never teach again.  In the profession of teaching, once you're a teacher, you're always a teacher.  If I'm never in a classroom again, I'll always be a teacher.  And I've...  Therefore, you unequivocally say you have never harmed a child and wouldn't because you're  a teacher ever harm a child.  Right.  All right.  All right.  How about molest, Larry? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  How about use the word sexually or the way you'd say sexually mollest?  Because...  Mollest.  John Carr is a psychopath and he doesn't think that fucking a kid is bothering it.  Right.  Because a lot of pedophiles, look, they really do love children.  Some of them are sadists.  Other ones don't want to hurt kids.  They truly love children.  They want a relationship with them.  And they think that it's okay what they're doing because they love kids.  Yeah.  I mean, we really...  They think that the fact that they love children is the same bit twice when they're going to 
[00:22:30]  laugh.  The mollest crew.  Check it.  The motley underwear.  Do you ever put blood on a Superman symbol in someone's underoos?  Do you ever bother someone?  Do you ever bother?  Do you ever bother a boy in the way of ripping off his Flash Gordon shirt and biting him?  Were you ever slightly annoying to a child?  By lopping his head off with a little baseball hat on it? 
[00:23:00]  What a fucking idiot Larry is.  I want to be a teacher.  Why don't you say the words sexually abused or have you ever molested?  Use words that are undebatable.  Yeah.  Because this guy, if he said you ever bother a child, he's probably going to say no because  they love me and I love them.  It was in a loving relationship.  You'd never harm a child.  No, I love children.  I would only make them feel good.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  Listen to this one.  So then the obvious question is, you don't have to answer this.  Why did you say you didn't? 
[00:23:30]  This has something to do with a past arrest and a past criminal investigation that was  launched against me.  And I cannot make any kind of comments about that under advisement of my attorney.  Let's set it straight.  Are you saying you never said you harmed a child?  I'm saying that I believe that you're leading into an area that...  But it's simple, John.  You either said I did or said I didn't.  I'm not asking you about...  Well, I am saying that I've never harmed a child.  Okay.  I'm saying it right now.  I'm saying that I would protect any child who I thought was being harmed. 
[00:24:00]  I don't ever recall saying that I would harm you.  Why the fuck is he on this show?  If he's not going to talk about it, why is he on the show?  What about the JonBenet Ramsey thing where he said he was there?  Why did you say that?  Larish just keeps asking that and then throw him off the show.  Why did you say you were with JonBenet when she died?  I can't under-invite.  Get out.  Get the fuck out.  You're a pedophile.  Beat it.  You creep.  Well, just keep pushing the guy.  What do you mean your fucking attorney advised you?  Where was he in Thailand when you were sashaying along like one of the aliens? 
[00:24:30]  William Frawley pants.  Yeah.  What a douche this guy is.  And Larry, too.  Larry's a fucking softball lobber.  So you're saying, wow, you're really digging deep.  Yeah.  Oh, well, this next clip's going to really bother you, then.  In all fairness, though, Jon, and you don't have to comment.  Why does he keep saying you don't have to comment?  In all fairness, and believe me, just don't talk.  It's a talk show.  Maybe he'll trick him into saying something. 
[00:25:00]  You don't have to comment.  So you just say you don't have to comment.  You know, the person that's in the hot seat gets a little relieved.  Don't say that.  Maybe Larry thinks it puts them at ease.  Larry's a fucking suspender-wearing douche.  The hot seat to him is the seat they use for timeouts.  Because it's sexy.  Hot.  You're in trouble.  You've been a bad girl.  Where the hot seat is what a lad has after Mr. Cart disciplines him. 
[00:25:30]  Fucking creep this guy is.  Yay.  And fucking Larry's interviewing him like he just wrote a bestseller.  Yeah.  Like he's a nice guy.  You don't have to answer this.  I don't mean to pry, but did you or did you not smother and murder the child with a garret?  Fucking jackass.  What did you do with the little cowboy hat?  Did you wear it and prance around you?  Did you put it on?  Yelling yippee-yay?  Did you fire the little six guns like, pa-choo, pa-choo?  Pa-choo, pa-choo. 
[00:26:00]  Toddering old fool.  Asinine questions.  Oh.  In all fairness, though, John, and you don't have to comment, there were many reports that  you did confess to a crime, which is what caused the whole hoopla to be in.  Oh, crime.  That's why there were all the photographers.  That's why there was the insanity of the plane trip.  You had said you did something.  If you hadn't said you did something, you, don't you think you created the story? 
[00:26:30]  Well, I think that I have multiple opinions on who created the story.  You were part of it.  You know, the story.  That was certainly something that still disgusts me.  I want to be John Mark Carr, the unknown.  You know, I want to be able to walk down the street without anyone knowing who I am.  You said it on camera.  You're too bright not to know something that's cause and effect.  Well, you know, again, this goes back to what I'm telling you, that my attorneys have advised 
[00:27:00]  me not to talk about this thing.  It's not true.  There's no charges pending against you?  No charges pending against me, but it's not something that I can discuss without my  attorney giving me advice to discuss that or being with me.  And at this time, I'm being told by my attorney and advised that I shouldn't discuss this  matter.  Because, in all honesty, you know, at this point, I'm possibly a target for law enforcement 
[00:27:30]  to just keep their eye on me.  Oh, perish the thought.  Let's keep an eye on a fucking guy that said that he was with a girl when she died and had  kiddie porn on his computer that they lost his evidence in California, and that's the  only reason he walked from that fucking case.  And he's just a creep in Thailand.  Why doesn't fucking Larry just say, why did you say I was with JonBenet Ramsey when she  died?  And then show the clip.  Larry, I know, you know, I was, I asked you not to mention that name or those allegations. 
[00:28:00]  Why doesn't he just fucking sandbag this cocksucker and play that clip?  Play the clip.  I don't get it.  I'm being nice.  I'm trying to get better guests.  They said if I got him, I'd get Tom Hanks.  Roland told me.  Roland said.  Roland said if I talk to John Mark Carr, I'd be able to get honest tool.  So, John Mark Carr, you have an eight-year-old opening wide Friday.  What a waste of time. 
[00:28:30]  Larry K's an ass.  Just lobbing softballs at this fucking pedophile who really likes softballs.  He certainly does.  Drunk Mexican from Virginia.  Is Jimmy upset because Carr is a sicko or that he isn't handing out pointers?  Ah.  I don't like.  And DJ Anal Lightbulb from posthores.net as Larry King, I don't mean to be uncouth, 
[00:29:00]  but did you shove your hog in a toddler?  That's exactly what he should be asking.  You don't have to answer.  He's a real journalist, and that fuck, he's letting that coward hide behind his lawyer,  which this actually just makes John Carr look more like a fucking creep than he already did.  I was with her when she died.  Why did you say that?  Did you lap, hairless twat?  You don't have to answer.  Just wink.  Look, me, you, Betsy, a toddler.  What a creep.  Did you open her little pussy because you thought there was a pearl in it? 
[00:29:30]  Because it looked like a little oyster?  Were you pearl hunting?  He was just smart and wanted to get out of Taiwan.  You were helping little boys make wee-wee.  Were you?  Was that what you did?  Were you really kissing her little vagina like it was a Muppet mouth? 
[00:30:00]  Ah, shit.  Let's get out of here.  Line up the date.  Now, you don't have to answer this, but when you left that home,  did your penis smell like blood in Similac?  You don't have to answer if you're a turning advisor not to.  Fucking the Motley Crue.  But I need to know.  I like to cut his throat and watch just dust fall out of it.  He's fucking finished and irrelevant Larry King.  Fucking suspenders wearing idiot.  How about a real question?  You're a fucking journalist.  He gave him nothing.  He fucking didn't guess one. 
[00:30:30]  We asked fucking Brian Cox tougher questions over at CBS.  Yes.  Holy shit.  Nothing.  What the fuck is a fritter?  What?  What's a fritter?  What are you talking about?  An apple fritter.  What's an apple fritter?  Oh, Anthony wants apple cake.  He didn't say fritter.  I don't even know what a fritter is.  I'm scared.  You raceless creep, Sam.  What are you talking about?  I got a list.  No apple cake.  Just blueberry cake or apple fritter. 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  What is an apple fritter?  It's more flaky.  How big are they?  It's kind of turnover.  How about this?  You get a turnover.  Exactly.  It's kind of like a turnover.  Then just put, like, his arms apart, like, how big is a marlin?  Did you see the fritter?  There's your fritter.  That's a fritter?  You don't want that.  Go with the blueberry.  That's like an apple turnover.  It's good.  Yeah.  It's a little more flaky than cakey, but I'm going with the apple fritter. 
[00:31:30]  No.  That's right.  No.  It's fritter talk on 202.  You might actually gain a pound.  I don't think you can do that.  Blueberry.  Guys, let's do a funny feature.  Cake or fritter?  Call up and tell us why.  What do you think Anthony should have, a fritter or a blueberry cake?  You tell us, and he'll eat it.  Or see, neither.  A cock in his butt.  Well, game over.  Sam?  Yeah? 
[00:32:00]  Sam.  Yeah.  What's a fritter?  I don't know.  It's like a pastry.  It's a donut type of glazed pastry.  How big is it?  Oh, it's about the size of a donut and a half, but there's no hole in it.  A donut and a half without a hole.  Yeah.  And it's got, and it's apple, is it like an apple turnover?  It's like a flaky with some strudel icing?  It's like a pancreas.  Yeah, it's kind of like a, I don't know if it's flaky.  It looks, it could be flaky. 
[00:32:30]  It's a little.  All right, let's talk to the Starbucks employee.  I want to get the definition from the Starbucks employee.  Put the person on their thing.  Say that again, sorry.  Give the lady behind, is it a lady or a guy behind the counter?  All right, hang on.  All right.  Oh, there's a line here.  Just walk up to the front and tell us for a radio show description.  You have to say that, right?  You got the answer to every question you said wrong.  Excuse me.  There's somebody on the air who wants to talk to you. 
[00:33:00]  Hello?  Hi, sir?  Hello?  Do you see the guy that just gave you the phone?  Hello?  Hello?  Do you see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  Sir?  Hello?  Extremely low.  Do you see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  The guy that just handed you the cell phone.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yes.  You see the guy that just gave you the cell phone?  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  He told us that you've been uppity.  This is Sam now.  What are you talking about?  The guy that just gave you the cell phone said that you've been uppity.  It's Sam, Opie.  I don't have any company.  It's Sam.  We're doing a thing.  Are we talking to Sam now?  Yeah.  Sam, did you give the cell phone to the guy?  Yeah, I just did.  And he couldn't hear us?  I guess he said you were low.  I'm putting you on speaker phone now.  You want me to give you back to him?  Why? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Put us on speaker phone.  All right.  Hang on.  Let me grab the same guy.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Hey, this is on speaker now.  Hello?  Can you hear us?  Attention, all colored folk.  Attention, all colored folk.  Get out of Starbucks, you colored people.  There's AIDS.  It's a white store.  There's AIDS in the muffins.  AIDS in the muffins.  We don't serve your kind.  All uppities leave the store immediately. 
[00:34:30]  There's AIDS in the muffins.  Who is this?  Who is this?  What's a fritter?  What is a fritter?  Our friend is going to buy a fritter, and we don't know what it is.  What's an apple fritter?  He thinks it's a racial slur.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  I hope the phone went dead because it was being smashed against Sam's teeth.  They hit me in the mouth with the phone. 
[00:35:00]  I had to go to the hospital.  I think that hurt.  I'm Sam.  But I'm related to Thomas Jefferson.  You know, he had black people, as are you.  Exactly.  He'll be hearing Christmas music next when he wakes up.  All right, let's play Richard Simmons entertainment tonight.  Does he know I want a fritter?  Shit.  Someone call him back.  Yeah.  Tell him, get a fritter from the knitter.  Anthony's a fritter lover. 
[00:35:30]  Do you want your daughter marrying a fritter, sir?  All right, let's play some Richard Simmons crying on E.T.  What's, uh-oh.  Don't spit in it.  What happened?  The phone's not picking up.  It just goes right through his phone.  I hope they smash his stupid cell phone.  You know, Sam's probably trying to remove the phone from his colon.  It's a radio show.  They do that.  Ow.  Sam?  Yeah, I'm here.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  He said it cut off when the phone went to the back. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Uh, did you get my fritter?  No, but I will get it right now if that's what you would like.  Yes, I would, please.  Hey, is there a lady online?  Uh, yeah, there's a couple of ladies online.  All right, give the phone to a lady.  A lady.  Okay.  Excuse me.  Would you like to talk to a radio show real quick?  Down the phone.  Uh, yes.  Hang on a sec.  Uh-huh.  Excuse me, miss.  Would you like to talk to a radio show really quick?  Down the phone right here. 
[00:36:30]  None of the ladies are talking to me.  Tell her we'll buy their coffee if they talk on the phone with us.  Yeah, we're trying to, we're trying, we're taking a call about Starbucks.  They're trying to do calls about Starbucks, so buy your coffee if you talk on the phone.  Just for a second.  Hello.  Hello, miss.  What's your name?  Glenn.  Hi, Ann.  Uh, you know, we actually just asked our guy to hand the phone to the ugliest woman online.  So, as a result of that, you win a free cup of coffee. 
[00:37:00]  He picked you.  Thank you.  Are you fat?  No problem.  Thank you.  Are you fat?  How did he do?  Was he accurate?  She's leaving.  Sam, get us on speaker.  I love that gag.  Oh, my God.  Is that the best?  Sam? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Are we on speaker?  Yes.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.  We're going to hear you.  No one's going to hear it there.  No?  No.  That's too bad.  Damn it.  Yeah, he wants an apple fritter.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  And after all that, don't spit in it.  All right.  I'm going to get an apple fritter with jizzum on it.  An apple spitter.

[00:42:30]  Hi, Predator.  Yesterday we listened to the audio of Kinky Man.  We're going to move right on today with an actor.  This guy was an actor, Ant?  Well, he said he was an actor, but they questioned him on it.  And all they could really dig up was that he was an extra in Godzilla.  Godzilla, and they went to a clip of Godzilla, and I'm like, cool, we're going to get to see this guy.  You just see Godzilla and like a thousand people running.  And do they have to circle which one he was?  No, they couldn't even get that.  They couldn't even get that much out of him. 
[00:43:00]  Why would they show a Godzilla clip?  He goes, how did he go from being in a blockbuster motion picture?  They didn't say that.  Yeah.  And he was just kind of an extra.  He was an extra.  I think you see if Tobey Maguire walked in.  Yeah, this is the greatest show on TV.  We're hoping to have like ten episodes in the can.  Because the Predators are kind of on to Dateline at this point.  You've got to think, because now they're arresting him and everything.  You know something?  They've got to get dumber and dumber with each one.  Because now it's got to be all around the, if I may say, Predator community. 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Is that the proper terminology?  I don't want to offend anybody.  The Predator community that this is happening.  So I can't see him really doing too many more of these and getting 50 people over the course of three days is what they arrested.  50 people over the course of three days.  I think they could do it just in every town without the cops and just lock up Predators.  I mean, any town they go in.  You kind of need the cops there to lock people up.  No, I'm saying they could lock it without the cameras so it doesn't get, you know, too.  Oh, but that's not fun.  They do that, I'm sure. 
[00:44:00]  In every town?  Yeah, they do stings.  I don't know every town, but they do it.  Well, you know what I mean.  Right.  Sure.  So we listen to the actor.  He goes into the house that's a setup, obviously.  And the little fella or little girl, I don't know which one's going to be in this case.  It was a girl doing both parts.  She was the decoy, and she's very good.  Yeah.  She could sound like a little girl or a little boy.  Yeah.  She's well-rounded, by the way.  That's well-rounded.  Well-rounded.  You hear the anger in her voice when she found out, this guy was in Godzilla, and she's got to play this dumb role?  Godzilla.  Who? 
[00:44:30]  Who?  Godzilla.  Godzilla.  God damn it.  Give me a pen.  I've got to write all these down.  Who's Godzilla?  I love laughing about this later.  Godzilla.  It's an old movie.  It's gone with the Zilla.  We love to write them down.  Kling-clong.  Instead of Godzilla, it's Gon-Zilla.  Gon-Zilla.  I love laughing about this stuff later, so I want to keep track.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you for many laughs in my apartment.  Godzilla.  Store-closed.  Godzilla.  Godzilla. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Here's the actor.  He gets quite the surprise when the decoy doesn't walk out.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you?  Would you have a seat right there?  Instead, he meets me.  And remember, none of the men know they're being recorded on hidden camera.  Chris?  Yeah.  He's 34-year-old Chris Moore.  And like so many of the men I confront, he tries to lie about how old he thinks the boy is.  I thought he was 18.  He's told me.  You want to try again? 
[00:45:30]  If he's younger, I apologize.  I don't know.  All right.  You're free to go.  Do you know what would be really funny?  Is if they guessed lower?  How old do you think he is?  Two?  Two?  This is the greatest show on TV.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  Certainly.  Now that we've got the actor crying here, huh?  What do you have to say for yourself?  I'm ashamed. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  I just wasn't thinking right.  And I felt terrible.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is Opie meeting with E-Rock after the show.  Or if he said, how do you feel?  I wish you were younger.  Can I still bang him?  Yeah.  When all this is done, do I still have sex?  That's why he's really crying.  You mean I don't get the young ass?  This was seriously the first time. 
[00:46:30]  And I knew I was taking a huge risk.  So you knew what you were doing was wrong?  Yeah.  I know.  It becomes a tearful performance for an actor who says he's played many roles.  I've worked in background movies.  He was, uh...  You?  Intelligence.  And what do you do for movies intelligence?  Background standing work.  Last comic.  Mike Gagher.  Yeah.  I played Lenny Bruce once.  What would I have seen you in? 
[00:47:00]  I've never been kissed.  Uh...  Pearl Harbor.  That's it.  How did he get from being a stand-in on blockbuster movies to standing in our kitchen?  Why did you do it then?  Tell me what was going on in your mind.  I don't know.  You know how people will react when they see this.  I mean, this does not look good.  I don't know.  You think?  I'm trying to do the right thing, but I'm weak. 
[00:47:30]  I'm too fucking weak.  You hear how that guy's crying?  Every girl that leaves his house walks out with that sin and face.  Yeah.  Crying.  Mommy.  What did I do?  He's actually...  You know, he's a method actor, and he's working on a film called The Memory Repressor.  He was in Pearl Harbor as an extra, I guess.  An extra in Pearl Harbor.  There were a million extras in that.  I was the guy that was running away from the blast. 
[00:48:00]  I'm the guy who did this, and he throws his arms up and runs in a circle.  I'm the guy that grabbed a little boy when the bomb went off.  Yes.  A little Hawaiian child.  A little Hawaiian.  And I hit him in my underpants.  He said, like, how do you get into these movies?  Like, how?  He signed his name.  That's how we got in.  Yeah.  All right.  We move on.  Well, you know what?  It's funny.  He's an extra, so I guess he's used to five and under.  That's a good line.  Oh, but it's so inside.  Yeah.  That's a good industry line, man. 
[00:48:30]  Someone's driving right now.  Yes.  That Jim.  He's an insider.  Some guy in Hollywood Hills laughing and laughing.  Da-da-da.  Ha-ha.  And all of Alabama going, what the fuck?  Oh, no.  How about all of America?  Except for two guys in la-la land, as I call it.  Ha-ha.  I'm kidding, boys.  Dateline, Internet Predators, episode three.  We meet biotech musician.  And it doesn't look good for this next guy, either.  He's 56-year-old Stephen Coates, who goes by the screen name M4 Pixeline. 
[00:49:00]  He works in the biotech industry and is a songwriter on the side.  He even has a website where he sells his work.  A songwriter on the side.  That's great.  What song is this guy?  What work on?  When I'm lying here in bed, I find it hard to believe that you're seven.  She was just nine.  You know what I mean.  Three candles. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you, Yoshi.  Very similar to a Yoshi joke.  Thank you.  Very similar to a Yoshi joke.  Oh, wait.  That was good.  Let him come.  Let him roll.  Too heinous.  Is that too heinous?  No. 
[00:50:00]  No.  What are you kidding?  Everything's fair game on this show.  This is almost so wide open, I'm like mentally salivating and coming up with nothing.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  Damn songwriter.  This clip's great.  He's requesting anal.  Is this the songwriter?  Yeah.  It doesn't get much better than this.  He goes on to explain to the girl he thinks is a 13-year-old virgin that they should have  oral sex because intercourse is a big step.  And he adds, sometimes people just do anal sex first. 
[00:50:30]  He's just filling her mind with this, hey, you know, if you're a virgin, sometimes they  just do the anal first.  Are you kidding me?  He's trying to show he's a nice guy.  Like, hey, look, that's personal.  I'll just put it in your shitter than your mouth.  You won't take your virginity away from you.  You won't sit down until you're 18, but you should really save that for someone special.  I'll just fuck your ass.  I can't do anal, sir.  All right, put this mud in your pussy.  Everyone knows that's the wedding hole. 
[00:51:00]  You're a special girl.  We're going to save that.  The wedding hole.  It's good, right?  Thanks.  Then you're still a virgin.  And then he starts asking about her body.  How tall is she?  How big are her breasts?  And one of the most frequently asked questions, if she has hair in private places.  When the decoy says, not really, the 56-year-old says, that's terribly sexy.  He raises a good point. 
[00:51:30]  Well, I just prefer to have been shaved as opposed to not having showed up yet.  I want to fuck your ass.  I want to fuck your ass.  Oh, she's three.  Oh, she's three?  No.  She had no pubic hair.  Yesterday, you were only seven.

You're just like, he's the songwriter.  All right, here we go.  Another clip from Biotech Musician.  He tells her he's trying to be discreet so his wife and son don't find out.  And here he is, coming in the door.  What's in the bag?  Oh, nothing really. 
[00:52:30]  It appears our songwriter has brought along some of his own work.  But he quickly realizes he won't be playing it for a child.  Good evening, how are you?  Oh, why don't you have a seat on the stool there, please?  Yeah, I get in the fuck up first.  And soon, he'll be singing a different tune.  Ah, singing a different tune.  This reporter...  Oh, my God.

Yeah  Yeah  Didn't learn  Here comes South Bay Guy 310  A year ago, he was caught talking to a perverted justice volunteer  who was posing as a 12-year-old  His name and other personal information  were posted once before on perverted justice's website 
[00:58:00]  Which usually means his employer, family, and neighbors  were contacted by perverted justice members  and directed to his sexually charged chat log  But it seems he didn't get the message  Here he is back online with the same screen name  South Bay Guy 310  Three minutes into the chat  he asks the girl if she's a virgin  Then he wants to know if she's ever had sex  with a guy from online before  The girl says, yeah  And so he asks, do you want to meet and see what's up? 
[00:58:30]  That all happens in less than eight minutes  from the start of the chat  And as you'll hear, it gets more disgusting  Can I videotape us?  Are you, like, gonna sell it?  No  LOL  I don't got a cam, though  I want to watch it and masturbate to it  Jesus  I want to watch it and  Oh, crap  South Bay 310  He likes it  That's his numbers  Between 3 and 10  Yeah 
[00:59:00]  South Bay 309 is an upstanding citizen  South Bay 310  Will fuck anything  Just as he pulls up  That's him driving by  There's another man being arrested outside  Yeah, get this  He calls the decoy to find out what's going on  Del quickly makes up a story saying her neighbor was arrested for dealing drugs  Amazingly, the police activity isn't enough to stop him  That's him coming in the door  32-year-old Keith Williams  He's got the alcohol and the camera 
[00:59:30]  He doesn't seem all that surprised to see me  You know what?  I know  Sit down, please  Okay  Please sit down  Relax  Actually, I'm not relaxed  I'm not gonna give an interview  You're not gonna give an interview?  No  No  No  I don't think it's in my best interest  But he proceeds to give the interview  Yeah  What are you doing here?  I'm stupid  I knew it better when I drove by 
[01:00:00]  I just knew it better  Why did you do it in?  I wasn't  I don't know  Because I enjoy having sex with young girls  I just  So you're bored?  You're gonna come over and try and have sex with a 13-year-old girl?  No  Look at that  Yeah  Shouting that down  I don't know what I was gonna do  But in his chat, he makes what he was going to do pretty clear  You want to take pictures of her?  Take naked pictures of her?  Oh, dude, I don't know  I'm not denying anything I said 
[01:00:30]  It's all right there  Did you ever hear of a group called Perverted Justice?  Yes, I have  I know about that  I don't know how old they are  They were posted here after talking to a girl who said she was 12  Oh, I just  God  And you know it's not their first time  No  They've had it done it 5, 10 times already  65, 7-year-old man walking in  They're just that disgusting  Vos, you got a couple daughters  How do you protect them from this type of thing?  Well, they can't read so they don't go online 
[01:01:00]  It's just  Do you watch their activity online?  No, but they're not allowed to go into chat rooms, you know  Yeah, but you know what?  I know parents that say the same crap  But then their kids are still on the, you know, in the rooms  And it's not  This is what's going on in schools these days  That, you know, the kids get home from school  And they're just on AOL or what have you  IMing like crazy, you know, all their friends all over the place  It's just, you know  You can't really police it  And a kid that just goes to school with a skirt, whatever

[01:11:00]  Coming in here  After seeing police  I just thought  She might have been sure  About something next to her  I was like yeah  I don't know  Maybe  Honestly I don't know  Now when I walk out  Am I going to be arrested?  That's not up to me  It's up to the 15 cops outside  Right  Waiting to arrest you  It depends how fast you can run  Yeah  Which way are you gonna go?  Right  I would talk for as long as possible  In that kitchen  Yeah  Can I get a Diet Coke maybe?  Well  Wait till the Statute of Limitations runs out 
[01:11:30]  Yeah  Seven years we've been talking  We got Pete Townsend on the line  From Great Britain  Pete  Oh  Hey mate  If he's gonna throw that computer  Why I'll play it  You know what I'm saying  About the rough boys there mate  Pete Townsend  My friend Gary Glitter's over here as well  He's got a little tune  He wants to play on the little meat flute  Meat flute  Alright Pete  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na  Eight  Da-na-na-na-na  Alright  Who are you? 
[01:12:00]  Wait there's a pile up cop arrested  What's this clip about?  I don't know  It continues the story  South Bay guy  Inside  Jazzman04  Decides to cut our conversation short  You need to come  I need to  No no no  Well I'm sorry  And makes a run for it  The detectives spring into action  Arresting the man sitting in his car across the street  Then Jazzman04  And then the man parked on the side street  This all happens less than six minutes from the time the first car pulls up 
[01:12:30]  As for that man who sat in his car while another man walked in the house  Guess what he does for a living  A federal agent working for the Department of Homeland Security  Active duty Homeland Security  There could be a terrorist in that pink little butt  He just had to work that out  He's looking for Al Kitta 
[01:13:00]  He wants to make sure he gets blown  No no  That was an interesting segment  Because three guys pull up at the same time  Three guys  One goes into the house  Yeah  It's a little slut  And two guys are kind of sitting in their cars  Just kind of watching the whole thing unfold  But not leaving 
[01:13:30]  Still again thinking  This might work out for me  This could be just something else  Maybe they're filming a movie  And they just sat there in the car watching  And the cops sprung into action  Arrested them  Well there's an extra here I recognize  They might be filming a movie  Yeah right  It wasn't the one you and Godzilla  Well so now we have  Godzilla  The Homeland Security guy is in the house  This is more on him now I think  We're moving on  He actually  He just gets arrested  I think he just runs  And so  Never makes it  Yeah but he cops a big plea 
[01:14:00]  This is him talking to the cops  Yeah  And remember the federal agent  He can't seem to stop talking to the cops  My father was a police officer  I was a police officer  I worked for the Department of Homeland Security  Okay  I understand you guys have a job to do  And I'm not trying to tell you  Anything else other than that  I swear to God  As God is my witness  I'm aware of St. Michael's Medal right now  Okay  I was not going to do anything with her  May God  But the detective doesn't seem to be buying his story  But I'm telling you  I don't believe it 
[01:14:30]  That you didn't intend to have sex  At some point  I swear to God  It would have happened  Sir I swear to God  It was not  I guarantee you  It would have happened  And he's got one more thing to say  To the disgraced federal agent  And in your position  You should know better  Sir  You know the law  That's even worse  You know what  That  That puts  That puts  A bad mark  On my job  On everybody  Every cop in this country  You put a bad mark on them  Ah  I know sir

[01:41:30]  No but  Well I don't know  People had to buy tickets  It was a special XM event  Because they taped  This ours confidential thing  But people were going there  Thinking they were going to  Hear some police  You know you do  You go seek out  A police tribute band  That's good  You know what the singer  Looks like  All the rest of the guys  Kind of look like  The band sounds like it  And then you go  Ah this is just as good  Better than seeing  Fucking Sting  Because Sting's going to  Sing shit  And play a lute  Emo F from Staten Island  Opi it's called 
[01:42:00]  Increasing estrogen levels  As you get older  They turn into women  They turn into women  They get all sensitive  Well finally  Two hours in I guess  Sting decided to play  A police song in the lute  Do we hear a little of that  Oh shit  You want to hear this  Say good  Because I didn't  I didn't  I couldn't  I could not even fathom  What this would sound like  So I'm glad we have  A piece of it  What song  We should talk about this too  I'm sure people have  Stories out there  I saw Bob Dylan once  Back in the day  When I was living in Rochester  He was singing all his 
[01:42:30]  Songs that you know and love  But you didn't know that  No  You had no idea  Like people are whispering  Like what song is this  Yeah  And someone would have to go  That's Positively 4th Street  Really  I've heard Positively 4th Street  About a thousand times  Just as angry  I have no freaking clue  Positively not it  Well no  Well Bob Dylan  He likes to get up there  And just completely  Do the song  Completely different  If it's a fast song  He slows it down  And I don't know  I don't even like  When the words don't line up  Like they do on the album  Because then you try to sing along 
[01:43:00]  I don't go to concerts  And you're all fucked up  I hate it  Because I want to hear  What it sounds like  On the radio  Just like the record  That impresses the shit out of me  When a band can get on stage  And do it exactly like you hear it  On the fucking CD  That's why I don't go see Rap Live  It's like  I can't enjoy Rap Live  Rap Live  It's so bad  Rap Live?  Those five brothers  Marching around the stage  Stepping on each other  Blurting lines out  It's not mixed right  It don't sound right  Just sticking on albums man  You're getting shot  Yeah I was going to say 
[01:43:30]  A good drive by  You're getting shot in the audience  Beaten up and robbed  Because I'm white  And I'm there  What's that really famous  Bob Dylan song?  That really famous  Like a Rolling Stone  I mean  Yeah like  Like a Rolling Stone  He did that at the show  Oh the one that  Wait the one that  He actually tried to sing on  Lay lay lay  Lay across my big brass bed  It's like wait a minute  This isn't  And that's unfair to a motherfucker  Like I'm a pseudo rock fan  You know  I like a few  Like if I went to see 
[01:44:00]  Lev Zeppelin or something  Man I don't want to see  These motherfuckers  You know  Let the sun be down  Down down down  Down to down to down  No  You don't mind if like  They take one  And fuck around with it  Nah man  I mean that's how I feel  But I'm more like Anthony  You want to hear how the songs  You know  How you've heard them  A million times  Yeah  They want to experiment  With one for a little bit  And then jam a bit  Whatever  That's fine  In my life anyway  You don't want to hear the hits  That you know and love  Bastardized  Butchered  Yeah  Completely butchered 
[01:44:30]  And Zeppelin was a great one  For that  Zeppelin sounded like the record  For ten minutes  And then something happened  With Robert Plant  And he couldn't  Fucking hit the notes anymore  Yeah it was called heroin  Was it heroin?  And what did he inject it  Into his throat?  Probably  Fucking  Rita Crosby singing  Fucking Zeppelin  The guy couldn't hit the notes anymore  So they  Only Patti LaBelle  They tuned him down right?  Yeah  Aretha Frank  Only black women  Could sound just like their records  Yeah  Thank you  Only  I think a lot of them 
[01:45:00]  Might be able to  They think it's artistic  They're not  That's the whole problem  Like Springsteen  Right  The concert I saw  He's like well let me reinterpret this  No no  I want you to not reinterpret it  Don't  Do the fucking song  Stop it  Hey someone's talking about Tool  You're right  Scarecrow from Houston  Have you seen Tool?  They even make the guitarist feedback  Match the album  Very true  See that's what you want  Alright well here is Sting  On the Loot  Doing a police classic  Oh no  Oh no  Who's clapping  Thank you

Hey  Yeah, I don't know, man  Sting takes it to the extreme  And it really sucks when he does it  But a lot of guys  What they'll do is  They'll change things up 
[01:52:00]  Just because they get so  Fucking bored  You know what?  They get bored  But the people that are paying  For the tickets  They've maybe seen them  Once, twice  Right  So they want to see  And I know when I go to a concert  I want to fucking see  And hear the record  That's it  Of course  I don't want to fucking  I don't want your  Experimentation thrown in  That you could do at home  In your studio  Yeah  Well, he doesn't play at home  In his studio  For, you know  For money  For live money 
[01:52:30]  You know  He's got to  You know, Ant  When a musician goes on tour  It's the same thing  Over and over  Yeah, it gets boring  That's why they're getting  Paid so much money  To fucking do it  Yeah  Not to be self-serving  And that is so selfish  As an artist  But you should do a special  You know what you should do  If you do that  You should do a special  When you're that famous  Yeah  You should do a special venue  You know, where you go  This is  This is exactly what you're gonna get  Let everyone know  Let everyone know  That's all  Doing shitty things  And experimental things  And being good 
[01:53:00]  With all the money  That Sting gets thrown at him  You think he gives a shit  About, you know  Who's  Obviously not  See, he wants to get  Top price for his tickets still  That's why he's not gonna tell you  What you're gonna get  That's true  You know  How much money do you need  A lot of bands do it right though  A lot of bands do it well  Like  Well  Yeah  You too  They  You know  They break out acoustic versions  Of some songs  That everyone's used to hear  On electric  Yeah, but they  They got 8 billion hits  And they'll be on stage  And they'll 
[01:53:30]  They'll play all those good hits  There's a reason why  You too is still great  They know exactly  What their audience wants  When you go to  Hello  It's also a good show  They're working  It's one anthem after another  They know exactly  How to play these songs  Hello  No, Vertigo  They perform Vertigo  Exactly as they're supposed to  Right  Hello, hello  Hello  You never heard the banjo version of Vertigo  There is a banjo version  I swear to God  But they did it as a goof  As a goof 
[01:54:00]  One of those YouTube videos or something  They did a banjo version of Vertigo  It was pretty funny actually  If they tried to do that live on stage  It'd be pelted  Joe, I don't have your guitar song here  Oh, oh well  Well, I have  I can't even say it  Guitar-Arthur Park  Guitar-Arthur Park  Is one of them  Guitar-Arthur Park  Yeah  It's MacArthur Park  It's my follow-up to the Guitar Father  But you said there's another one  That's even better  Yeah, that was  A Taste of Honey  You want me to send it over to Steve?

[01:56:30]  If they were to go see  John the lute  Yeah  It'll be different  But if it was like this  Let's go see this dude  John Smith  This mother  I heard he's  He's a hard-rocking  Yeah, he rocks, man  Listen to some of his old shit  Sounds like the police  Let's see  Guys, this proves  You're not tools  For the company  Is Earthbrown  FBA  From Buffalo  Oh, we are  XM did a lot of work  To get Sting  And you guys  Rip it all up  I can imagine  XM management  Not being too happy  With these anti-Sting breaks  Screw them, too  We have a lifeboat

[02:17:30]  It's almost like  A sick way of healing  You're making me want  You've got a whole handful now  It's bringing back memories  I guess  Bury the shame  Bringing back memories  How good it felt back then  Opening that bag  Opening that bag  And you're going  Oh wow  You'll show her  Yep  She can't hide it from you  Not one  I wanted just one  That's all you wanted  That's all I wanted  She said no to me  Fucking bitch  No I love my mom  Fucking bitch 
[02:18:00]  I love my mom  But what a whore  Seriously  Why wouldn't she let you have one  It was Halloween time  What'd she think  She wanted to save them  For the trick or treaters  Other people  She cared about them  More than you  Yeah  She loved the trick or treaters  A little more than you  Exactly  What the fuck  Hey Joe  Can I have one  Of one of  One of  Mother's hidden treasures  I have one of these  Oh my god  Mother's  They're delicious  Oh god  I'm going to have one too  I'm enjoying  I don't even want any more  But I want more  It's kind of nutritious too  I mean it's got a nut  Nuts are high in protein  Coconut in there 
[02:18:30]  That's like a plant or something  Oh yeah  A little chocolate  Just hold it to your nose  And smell it  As far as candy goes  This is probably the best for you  Oh the coconut  Coconut  You ever actually touch it to your nose  You touch the skin  Like the nose  And upper lip skin  Yeah  Danny how many has he eaten  16  And he's got 17  Well there's 17  And 18 is actually in his hand as well  God damn  They're good  Yeah they're really good  Jimmy how many have you eaten  36 
[02:19:00]  Yeah Jimmy's  Getting right up  Jimmy  Jimmy's getting pulled right into this  This isn't part of the fat smash diet  You know  Yes it is  Yeah when are you starting the fat smash diet  I started today  This is like  This is like a little fucking  A little asterisk  Like I had a few almond joys  I looked at Rogan eating one  And I'm like  Well Joe's having one  Like you know  Two men with the same workout regimen  Are going to eat your almond joys  Two men treating themselves  Because they've been working out so hard  Yeah exactly  Preparing for fights you know 
[02:19:30]  Joe and I  Just treating ourselves with some candy  Just a little bit  Twitchels  Is your sponsor going to call?  Hmm?  Is your sponsor going to call?  You got like an AA?  I don't have a sponsor  Fuck them  Hey Pat  We want to thank you  For letting us know about this  Oh don't do that  Oh it's absolutely my pleasure  Thanks Pat  Anything else you know about him  Let us know on a future show  Oh yeah I'll be checking in  With other little OCD tidbits  On my man there  Jim Norton  You got any references  From New Masons?  And if they're unwrapped  They'll probably eat more  Why?  They're unwrapped 
[02:20:00]  Because they're right in front of him  And he knows they'll be wasted  Yeah they're all unwrapped  He can't stand to think of them  Wasted and thrown out  And unloved and uneaten  And I don't blame you  He's an environmentalist  Catholic  Let's say how to Eric in New Jersey  You can't waste food  That's for real  You can't waste food  Eric  It's so good  Hey Eric  What's up?  Listen I just wanted to ask Twitchells  What does his mother feel like  When he's getting all this abuse by you  Does she want to just  Come over to the studio  With a shotgun  And shoot you guys?  My mother's very supportive  I love her  And she  Called her a whore  Supports what I do 
[02:20:30]  Oh  You did call her a whore  I was very disappointed  Did you ever mush those almond joys  When you smack them against your face?  I was just angry  What about your dad?  That's all I wanted was one  And it's just  I dwell on it  When I keep thinking about it  Just one  Just one  That's all  What about your father?  What did your father feel about this abuse?  My dad's a Vietnam vet  He was sprayed with Asian orange  And nom  He's like  Fucking  I'm trying to  Think of a comparison here  He's like  A gomer pile  Mixed with  Steve Urkel  He's so nice  But he's kind of dull  I love my dad 
[02:21:00]  I'm not making fun of him  But if you met my family  I swear to God  You would understand a lot  You just wanted one  This is becoming a real thing man  Alright Eric  Don't touch me  Don't touch him Eric  He just wants one  Why are you touching him?  Why are you touching him?  Who do you think was more supportive?  Your dad or your mother?  They're both supportive  I love my parents  I really do  Did you ever have feelings like you don't love them?  No  If your mom would have let you just have that one though  I mean when I was a kid I was angry  You know when they wouldn't let me have what I wanted  Could have just had one 
[02:21:30]  Why are you splitting them in half now?  Why are you asking so many questions?  Ooh  He gets a little attitude  He gets some sugar in  Look at that  Yeah why are you?  No offense  Leave him alone  No offense  Let him eat his almond joys  He's kind of changed  He is changing  He's changing  It's the sugar  He is  He's not twitching  He's getting a glare  A glare with a twitch  I know  Can you throw me one of those delicious treats?  They're very good  Jimmy enough  We might as well just give  Twitchels is generous with his almond joys though 
[02:22:00]  He's not selfish  Thank you  He shares  We might as well  There's five bags in front of him  He's got his dad's three mile stare right now  We might as well give Jimmy his own bag at this point  No no no  I just want Nathaniel to once in a while  Wasn't there a guy in San Francisco that killed somebody and blamed it on eating Twinkies?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah the Twinkie defense  Did that fly?  I don't think so  I feel like it did  You know what's funny?  Initially that makes sense  You ever see a bag of almond joys come apart like that?  If I ate a whole box of those I'd do something fucked up  Hold on  That spongy shit 
[02:22:30]  Just swallow slow  That's gotta be the worst thing for you ever  Those things were never good either  No  Danny  I used to always buy them  My brother used to fight over them  Like these things sucked  Twinkies  Danny how many?  23  That's not that many though  There's so many more to eat  Look at his face  23  How many come in a bag?  Well there's only about another 20 in front of him  He's gonna puke  No he's not  For sure he's gonna puke  No he won't puke  Eventually he's gonna puke  He did when he was a little boy I bet you  Did you puke when you were a little boy? 
[02:23:00]  When it happened initially  I bet you did  You're gonna puke today buddy  Did you puke into your mother's purse?  27  Just to get her back?  Just wanted one  Dude  27 come in a bag  In one bag?  No you almost ate a whole bag  He only wanted one  That's all he ate when he was a boy  Just wanted one  All mother had to do was give him one  Is that really a harsh request?  Absolutely not  I don't think it is  Completely  And I think you're justified to lash out at her right now  Yeah I'll let  I can't stress enough  I love my parents  But you know what?  If your kid wants a little piece of candy  And always ask him for one  Then I think you should oblige 
[02:23:30]  Yeah  Exactly  Especially when he does that  Chris has a very good idea  Chris in North Carolina  Chris?  Hey O&A  You guys are awesome  Hey uh  I wanna see if uh  Little Twitchels  Would bob for Almond Joys  On Jimmy Norton's crotch  Oh  That's a great idea  Stupid  He's already eating Almond Joys  Why does my cock have to be involved?  I already have nothing in my mouth  Yeah give this bit somewhere to go 
[02:24:00]  We gotta build  That was Twitchels' best line  And it just slipped right by everybody  Yeah  The mic wasn't on the mic  What else is new?  Cause Eric was fucking around  Yeah what was it?  He said I already have nuts in my mouth  Yeah  Eric just shook his eyes  Let's go to James in Florida  James  Hey I got an idea man  Uh  Make Twitchels eat Almond Joys  Uh  Then make him jump till he pukes  Ramone  Bring Twitchels  An abortion  Why sir?  You're making me  H.T. from Yellowstone  That's the funny guy from the tire store  Funniest guy at Sears 
[02:24:30]  He's not gonna jump  He's already jumped  Now he's just eating  He's not gonna jump  He looks sick  It has calmed down  No he's mellow  Mellows him out  He doesn't jump  Uh oh  He's gonna hurl  That's gag one  That's gag one  He just eats  He just had his first gag  He looks like Fred Gwynn right now  He's got a fucking chuck  Like a broken fire hydrant  Chew slow  Is that Fred Gwynn?  Yes it is  Chew slow  He looks like a baseball player right now  A lot of shit in his mouth 
[02:25:00]  A lot more to go  Don't jump  He's got his game seven face on  No kidding  Don't jump  I'm back  I'm predicting projectile vomit  And I'm getting out of the fucking way  This is like that scene from that movie  What was that Stephen King movie?  The pie eating contest  What was that?  Thinner?  Was that what it was?  Thinner?  No  Stand by me  Yeah it was Stand by me  He's not twitching  Oh my god  How many are we up to?  Well he's gotta finish one more  Cause that'll be a full bag  A full bag  Just like when he was young  You don't wanna waste any of these  See  But I had a few 
[02:25:30]  So it's not technically a full bag  Yeah  Jump  You had a few out of my bag though  Jump  You don't wanna jump  Never jump while you're eating so many  Oh wow look at that  Don't jump  Just don't even think about jumping  He's not even jumping  No he won't jump  He's not even talking anymore  He's not twitching  He's not twitching  Twitch you wanna jump?  No he doesn't wanna jump  He's just enjoying some mom enjoys  If I was you  Maybe you'd feel better if you jump  You know  Get back to like a normal schedule  There you are  Yum yum yum  Yum  That's it  French kiss it  There you go  Yum  Oh wow look at that  It does mellow out as ticks though 
[02:26:00]  I gotta be honest  I used to get really grossed out  When people throw up  And now it doesn't faze me at all  People can throw up right in front of me  It's just funny now  Remember when you were a kid in the fat kid  In high school  And the fat kid used to puke in the hallway  And everybody would throw up  Yeah  Smell it  Not me  Now you're so desensitized  Look at that  Yeah  Vomit  You ever watch those Brazilian films  Where they have fucking Roman showers  Yeah  What is that?  They vomit on each other  What's up with the fart video?  The fart porn?  Have you seen that?  Yeah they're not real I don't think  You don't think so? 
[02:26:30]  No they're awful  It's pretty real to me  Somebody wants to know how many calories he's eaten  That's a very good question  That's gotta be 50 or 60  His pancreas is sweating  He's getting a murderous look on his face  Alright here we go  Someone who's good at math here  Amount per serving  200 calories  300 calories  How many in a serving?  Just one?  Three serving size  Three pieces  Oh that's not bad  So how many have you done?  I can do this man  About 30  He's up to 30  So 10 servings let's say  So he's got about  2,000 calories in him  2,000 calories of almond joys  That's alright  I'm telling you 
[02:27:00]  It's coming right across the car  Not on the console  Oh my god  I've been puked on twice in my life  Hold on Eric  Eric  Hold on  Every once by a chip  Once by my brother  And once on a public bus  He looks  He has that  Bad things coming threes  I'm getting the fuck out of the way  No he's okay  He's just chewing slow  Hold on  Eric has a good idea  Slow, mellow  Eric in San Diego  What's up?  Good morning boys  Good morning  I was thinking  He sounds a little distraught there  Maybe you should read 
[02:27:30]  One of E-Rock's tender sentiments  No time for tender sentiments  Sir  We're businesses at hand  Can Twitchells read  One of your tender sentiments?  He's feeling a little bad  About himself right now  You know what  I'll give it to you  Because you've been putting your fingers in your mouth  I'll let him read it  Okay  Oh yeah  Okay  I won't even look at it  Dan  Hand Lewis  His tender sentiment  No one will ever be  Quite like you 
[02:28:00]  Thank you  You're welcome  You're welcome  And how about rewarding this good boy  With an Almond Joy  Yes  Give this boy his just desserts  I believe mom would have gave you an Almond Joy  Mother would have given you at least one for that  If she cared  Yeah  If she really cared  Saying no  How do you not want an Almond Joy  When you see a bag of them  Why do they do that to kids?  Every little boy deserves an Almond Joy  I think you should just try three or four at a time  I don't think one at a time is getting in there  Because the mouth is not full you're saying Joe  Yeah  I mean you've got to really get the full taste of the experience 
[02:28:30]  What are we up to?  He's got 29 in his head  He's got 29  29?  It was 35 minutes ago  Yeah  It was  We were rounding it out  Oh we're rounding it out for calories  Yeah for calories  So you're almost up to 2,000 calories  Fill that mouth up with chocolate and just swallow  Swallow  Do you have a saliva build up yet?  That build up do you get when you're on a boat?  Jim what was that line from?  When you're on a boat  You're trying not to puke  You're looking at the horizon  I've used it before in some way or another

[02:35:30]  I know  I think we've cured a lot  We cured the jumping thing  And we cured the whole Tourette's thing  It's all just a little sugar  Evidently  The cure to Tourette's  Is to eat a homemade  Fucking almond joy  Don't touch him Eric  Let a boy enjoy his almond joy  Oh you're wasting it  Don't waste it  You're wasting it in the trash can man  Some of us  Dude those were really good almond joys  And you know  Some of the almond joys  There's so many  He's pushing it back into the trash  Oh  Yeah  He's pushing it  Alright  This is so disgusting  He's pushing it back into his mouth  It's coming out of his mouth 
[02:36:00]  It looks like shit  And then he pushes it back into his mouth  Someone doesn't want to waste it  What's wrong with a boy who enjoys his treats without wasting them?  The anger I would have felt  At not being able to have any candy  She was going to give candy to 30 other boys  She didn't even know  And girls  And girls  Exactly  Dirty, filthy girls  Yeah  She hates you  My almond joys  Yeah  And mine  What'd you want to do with them, huh?  With the girls or the almond joys?  With the girls  Do you want to punish them?  He's getting another one  I bet you wanted to eat all their almond joys, didn't you? 
[02:36:30]  Send them home without them  How come the jump thing isn't working on you now?  How come jump isn't working on you now?  There's nothing that fills you like an almond joys  There's nothing more important  This is weird  Stop  His Tourette's has been cured  You really are  It's so bad I think it's  You're doing a bit  I know you're not now  There's a million dumb things going on here  So where did he eat these almond joys when he was a kid? 
[02:37:00]  He locked himself somewhere  In a closet?  Where'd you hide?  Where'd you hide?  Oh, he just sat down  That's never good  Put him in a cabinet  You found him though, right?  You looked and you looked and you found him  And putting him in a cabinet with that door closed  Was like her love that was closed off from you  You had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany Cufflinks  Or I will definitely fuck you up  Is he feeling satisfied?  Not yet  Now there's more  He's getting there though  He feels better  But there's more 
[02:37:30]  Why you little maggot?  You make me want to vomit  There's more  Isn't there, Twitchels?  There's always more, Lewis  Slow?  You want to promote your website?  Almondjoy.com  Laughter by Lewis  So much for having Hershey's as a sponsor  Laughterbyloo.com  Almondjoy.com  I wish we had that song  Almondjoy's got nuts  Mounds don't 
[02:38:00]  Sometimes you feel like a nut  Sometimes you don't  Almondjoy's got nuts  Mounds don't  Wow, he's kind of twitching  The twitching's starting to come back a little too  No, that's alright  Oh my god  Don't puke  You're going to waste all of it, man  You'll have to read it  Almondjoy's got nuts  Mounds don't  Jesus, what's in there?  Heroin?  Nah, he knows  He knows  He knows  He's satisfying an emptiness right now 
[02:38:30]  Of course he is  All he wanted was one  That's very reasonable  Every boy wants one  Almondjoy's got nuts  How hot is that Pamela Rogers chick?  That chick that fucked that little kid  Oh, she's fantastic  Fantastic  So hot  He was not slouch either  Can't blame me to one of them  Uh-oh, we got some  Twitchell started dry heaving toward Eric 
[02:39:00]  That's the thing about him  There's a vengeance with his puking  Yep  No, he's trying to hold it back  And he pukes and he goes back in and grabs two more  Here, have some more  Oh, no  Replace it  Replace it  I taste the Red Bull  He missed  Talk to Phil  I taste the Red Bull  It stinks  He tastes the Red Bull  I taste the Red Bull  Dude, it's puking  I taste the Red Bull  I taste the fucking Red Bull  Oh my god  It smells like puke and Red Bull 
[02:39:30]  At the same time  Look at Rogan's just hanging out  Like, I've seen this shit with horse assholes  This doesn't smell nearly as bad as horse assholes  This is nothing to you, right?  Yeah, I've seen people  Now we need contestants to eat that  And then we got a contest  Planted roaches, animal cocks  All that matters now, though  Just keep replacing the almond joy  That's cool  You threw up about six of them  So you gotta have a couple more  Just to get back to where you were  Danny, what's the number up to?  I know he's puked a little out  Yeah, the count's kind of off  I don't know  But how many has he attempted to eat? 
[02:40:00]  41  Oh, no way  41  He's still chewing  Oh  That's, uh, let's see  He's a good boy  He's a good boy  Ah, there's drool coming out of his mouth  His chocolate drool  3,400 calories, about  He's a good boy  And he deserves this little treat  Oh, no, no, not 3,400  When's the last time he did this?  Probably a long time, right?  You treat yourself  Watch it, watch it  No, he's okay  Just swallow it  2,700 calories, about  That thick, heavy swallow  It's thick and it's heavy 
[02:40:30]  He's trying to fucking puke on people  No, he's not  Hey, if you're gonna puke  Can you puke, uh, in front of the camera?  He's keeping it down  He's not trying to puke  He's trying to hold it in  Oh, no  He doesn't want to waste it  Oh, no  You're alright, right, Twitchels?  I'm sure he is  Here, listen to this  This'll suit  The garbage pail  Get the garbage pail  God damn it  That's okay  That's a lot of throw up over there  That's okay  Give him an almond joy already 
[02:41:00]  He doesn't feel good  This is, uh, unsanitary work condition  It certainly is  I don't think CBS radio would be going for this  There you go  These motherfuckers over at XM  Just don't care about your health  What?  Oh, God, it does just reek  It smells good like almond joy candy  Please hit the garbage pail  No, he's just enjoying it  He, like, loses control  And the garbage pail falls over  No, he's trying to hold it in  His body wretches  He's trying to hold it in  He doesn't want to waste it  Oh, it looks like a German shepherd  Had diarrhea over here 
[02:41:30]  You don't eat a whole bag of that yumminess  And try to waste it  You want to eat and save all of it  You've got to see the logs  What's the point?  Twitchell  You've got to see the logs on the floor  Did you want to puke on your mother?  No, he wanted to eat it all up  No  Eat it all up  Why waste it on her?  How good were they when you were eating them  When you were a kid?  They were delicious, right?  Naughty treat  Right?  You get me?  Sneaker treat  You get me?  You get me?  You fucking get me?

[02:42:00]  What's the sugar do to him?  He's already thrown up  And yet he's eaten more  Yeah  Because there's many more to be eaten, Joe  What is he going to do?  Waste them?  Leave them for other boys and girls?  They're his  He's got to eat what's on the table  In front of them  Jimmy, the rationalization  That's the truth  They're his  They were bought for him  There you go  It's like every little boy's fantasy  To have a whole bag of almond joys  All for you  Danny's covering up his  It stinks in here  His nose and mouth with his shirt  It's kind of good that I have a cold

[02:43:30]  And he shoved it in his mouth  And I just  That one made me try  There you go  I am not invincible  When it comes to throw it up  And I just cut a gander  You can't break me  He just broke me  Danny's gonna puke  Oh, Danny should stop it  I gotta admit, all I smell is almond joy  Who needs Halloween?  Who needs Halloween?  He just broke me  He just broke me  Oh, God  No one needs it  Listen  Look at that almond joy on the console being wasted  Dude, he threw up on one of those almond joys  And then shoved it back in his mouth

Joe, look at this shot  Oh, get it to Steve immediately  That's gotta go on openanthony.com  Show Rogan that shot  You gotta see the shot  One of your boys got, man  One of the death squad  He's got a perfect picture  That's the greatest  This looks photoshopped  It looks like there's a gopher  Jumping into his mouth  Look at this picture  It's great  It looks like a fucking animal 
[02:44:30]  Is running into his mouth  At light speed  That's the greatest puke picture ever  It's all over the studio  All over the console  Right where Hawk sits  Hawk is not happy  Oh, look at Eric  He looks like a rape victim  Grab those CDs  He almost got me  Can I have some more napkins?  How about some almond joys for this boy?  How about some puke-covered almond joys?  There's a few of those over there that are still pukey 
[02:45:00]  That's all he doesn't  No more  Just throw them out  We're done  Just get rid of those  Fuck you  I tell you when you're done  Get rid of them  Shit  That's right  Lewis tells you  He's a spider  Yeah  Hey, Pat  Thanks a lot for this little tidbit  By the way  Oh, my pleasure  I've been on the line  The whole time  He's been enjoying it  He's Pat  I gotta thank you  He's been on the line for 40 minutes  I gotta thank you, Pat  Because I like these almonds joys  It took a while  But at least there was a big payoff 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah  I wasn't going anywhere  Until the money shot came  The gopher  Hey, can we get that picture up online?  Steve  Where's  Can someone give that to Steve?  That picture has got to go online immediately  It's actually  Do you have a cable?  Yeah, he'll have a cable  Will you stop fucking feeding him those things, man?  I'm getting sick  Here, Danny  Brian  Hey, Jason in Virginia Beach  What's up?  Hey, man  That is the funniest damn bitch ever, man  We're sitting here smoking the fattest joint  You're smoking a joint?

Hey, good morning, guys  Hey, hey  Listen, what would happen  Would his OCD just kick in 
[02:47:00]  If you were just full of almond joy  And just take it away from him  Before the big climax?  What would happen?  We got the big climax  But he refuses to stop eating  Yeah, we think he's having a almond joy  Just take it away from him  See if you'll find Joe Rogan  Nah, yeah  He's so sick right now  He can't even stand up  He's sitting down  Yeah  But he's still  Hey, Opie, you want to do the math  On how many calories he just puked up?  How many did he eat?  40-something?  Uh-oh  I'd say close to 50  His head's  Close to 50? 
[02:47:30]  His head's tilting back  See, he throws up with his head back  So it fills up his mouth  And then it pours out of his mouth  Because he's trying not to throw up  Yeah, it's really sick  Well, it smells like chocolate in here  I love the smell of chocolate  Bile  Yeah  Delicious  Ah, no reason  I know exactly what that smells like  How odd  Of course you do  I've seen people  They serve it  On Fairfactor bile  Actual animal bile  Cows  That's one of the ingredients  That we've made people drink  No, no  Hit the pail 
[02:48:00]  Get the pail  Anywhere but the pail  Fuck, that's disrespectful  Mwah  Disrespectful  You're puking right on my feet  He's gotta be nuts  That he's puking so close  To the death squad  Insane  Yeah, you know what that's like  That's like suicide by cop  Yeah  Just puke on a couple of UFC guys  I'm sorry  You're nuts  You didn't get me  These guys will snap your neck  Don't hurt me  Yeah  I don't think either one of them  Would grab him  Look at how there's all that Red Bull

[02:53:30]  I don't have the list  In front of me yet  Maybe that's it  The Tony Award nominated  Right  Stephen Lynch  Broadway star  Director Davis  Guggenheim  Guggenheim  Guggenheim  From the  One movie?  Does he have a museum?  One movie?  Why would we know  One movie?  Why would we know that?  Ben?  Al Gore movie  Oh  Al Gore  Oh we'll have to get  Steve in here  I watched the movie 
[02:54:00]  I'm so glad  I have a hybrid vehicle now  And I'm thinking  Of getting another one  Is Steve over here?  Why are you  Against the environment?  I'm not against the environment  I'm against the BS  That comes out of some people  About the environment  Or the importance  Or lack thereof  Of the environment  And global warming  And things that are happening  It's just the way it is  Have you  Look at the earth  It constantly changes  Whether we're here or not 
[02:54:30]  It just changes  And a lot of the change  Is based on  The life  That inhabits this planet  Whether it's dinosaurs  Or mammoths  Or early man  What they do  On this planet  Affects it somehow  And the planet  Then changes  Adapts  Gets rid of some species  Whatever it is  We're just another one  We happen to have  A little more of a  Divine spark in our heads  So we can  You know  Pull dirt out of the ground  And make things that fly  Which is pretty amazing  If you think about it  And because of that 
[02:55:00]  Divine spark  We're able to ruin the earth  A lot faster  Than any other species  Than any other species  It doesn't mean it's wrong  Before us  It doesn't mean it's wrong  And we're not  Who says we're ruining it  Who says changing it  Is wrecking it  Why does it have to  Remain like it was  10,000 years ago  Why does it have to be  I don't want to worry  About getting a sunburn  In January  In New York City  That's why  People got sunburns  All the time  That's why  Basically  If you're concerned  About the continual  Survival of people 
[02:55:30]  Then it would bug you  But if you don't have  A problem with  Dinosaurs were around  And then they're not  We're around  Do you know how long  Dinosaurs are around too  Yeah but they weren't  Millions upon millions  It was their time  Get off already  And we've been around  For a while  Not that long  But  Compared to the dinosaurs  Not much at all  Unless there's some  Cataclysmic event  Like a meteor  That wipes out  All the life on the planet  We'll be here  For a long time  We'll figure it out 
[02:56:00]  We run out of fossil fuel  Oh my god  We're gonna put on  Loin claws and run around  Believe me  We'll figure something else out  Steve  We'll figure it out  In just a way  That's how we're the laziest  Things on this planet  That's what happens  We wait until we need something  Global warming  It's like  It's like a global term paper  Like what  What does this thing do  Yeah  You gotta have this done  By 2011  Ah  I'll wait  Yeah these next four years  It's like a weekend  Global warming  Do you honestly believe  Yes  That the polar ice caps 
[02:56:30]  Are gonna melt enough  Where they show Florida  Is a little nub  Sticking off  Just stop it  It is not gonna happen  Ah  It's gonna happen  This is gonna be the audio  Maybe thousands  Upon thousands  Of years  When earth takes  It's normal course  Of changing  Cause this planet  Changes  You look at the original  He really sounds like  He should have a lab coat on  Right now  I have a microphone  In front of me  That's all I need  Don't you know what that means  That means he's an expert  We have come to the conclusion 
[02:57:00]  That as long as you have  A mic in front of you  And you're broadcasting  To more than just one person  You're an expert  No matter what's coming out  This is the audio  That's gonna play  As the water rises  And all you hear is  But if you're on TV  You need a microphone  And a podium  And a podium  To lean on  Hey Jim in Washington  What's up  Birthdays are numbered  Yeah Anthony  What about Stephen Hawking  Saying that the earth's  Days are numbered  Earth's days are numbered  I didn't tell you  That that number 
[02:57:30]  Was 8,623,000  That's still  You know  Plenty of days  Don't go  The dinosaurs  Didn't put a hole  In the ozone layer though  You know what I mean  They were just kind of  Walking around  Eating leaves  And by the way  They are  What do you think  Fossil fuels made up  My friend  Dinosaurs  It's all their fault  No but it was in the ground  And we took it out  And we had the gumption  To pull it out of the ground  And make something 
[02:58:00]  That made the cars run  They were plotting against us  Millions of years ago  And we didn't even know it  Instead of saying  How bad everything we do is  Why not look at  How we can take rocks  And things  From trees  And things out of the air  And put them together  And make something that flies  It's amazing  We're amazing  We're an amazing species  So what  A couple of spotted owls  Have to pay the ultimate price  You ever heard  A frog with this kind of arrogance  Exactly  This is why  We already have enough  Statues of ourselves 
[02:58:30]  We've carved our faces  In the sides of mountains  We're wonderful  We are the most amazing thing  On this planet  We're not  We're not a planet  That's ever seen  We're locusts  We've been to the moon  With stuff we built  That was just sitting in the ground  Rocks  Who's we  Rocks  We  A few  Human  A few guys  The human race  A few guys have been to the moon  Humans  They don't allow us to go to the moon  We're locusts  Hey  We're locusts  We're gypsy moth  We can continue this rant  After the break  Alright  After the break  You guys are going to kill the show 
[02:59:00]  If we go way too long here  The worst  It's the worst  Of the Obi and Anthony show  Steve's in studio  I guess Iraq was saying  Through the instant message system  Whatever  That Steve was losing his mind  When Anthony was talking  About the environment  And that Earth's days  Are not numbered  Hold on  Hold on  Steve's very passionate  About this  I'm not very passionate  There's nothing wrong  With being passionate  Hold on  Hold on  I'll back you on this one  Iraq  He was saying that  He was getting aggravated  Anthony saying that  New York City was going to be  Underwater 
[02:59:30]  And Jesus Anthony  You don't know what you're  Talking about  You watch too many movies  No I don't watch too many movies  I'm not basing this on the  Day after tomorrow scenario  You're basing it on the  Al Gore movie  Yes entirely  Oh Jesus  I inform all of my opinions  On Al Gore documentaries  Al Gore  No I just  You're such a smart guy  And when you start  Thank you Stephen  And when you say things  That are so completely contrary  To what  To what's happening  To what's happening  It infuriates me  Because it makes  Somehow I think you're doing it 
[03:00:00]  Because you know  It's going to get a rise  Out of people  No  No not at all  I'll tell you what it is  Anthony has a different  Perspective on everything  He doesn't give a crap  What happens to this earth  After he's gone  He's one of those guys  But it's not after  He doesn't really care  It's not after you're gone  It's happening  Do you honestly believe  Let me tell you something  Do you honestly believe  If the ocean's levels  And water levels  On this globe  Rose  To a point where  I'm not even talking about  Where they said  The final point was  Where I  I saw a clip  Of Florida 
[03:00:30]  And it's pretty much gone  It's a little nub  Sticking off the bottom  That's their projection  Not even talking about that  Okay  I'm talking about  If it rose  To a point  Where people went like  Wow  This  Hey  Excuse me  Mr. President  The water's really rising  Problem is  It's not going to happen  Immediately  And that's the point  That this movie  An Inconvenient Truth makes  It doesn't happen immediately  It happens over the course  Of 50 years  Evolution doesn't happen immediately  Things  This planet 
[03:01:00]  Doesn't change immediately  It takes thousands of years  But  It constantly changes  And  And that's what  This planet is  A living kind of thing  The vast majority  Of the populations  Of this planet  Live in coastal regions  When all of a sudden  You start filling  Those coastal regions  Up with water  You're going to have  People that  You're going to have  A lot of displaced  Human beings  That are  I know  But  No no  They're going to  You know  But there's another  Thing happening  I see Anthony's point now  This stuff will happen  At such a slow pace  That these people 
[03:01:30]  Will be slowly  Moving out of these areas  And going elsewhere  Steve do you understand  That they were  If you lost  If you lost Florida  A week from today  Wow  That would be a really big deal  However  In addition to that  Matter of fact  New Orleans went under  And it wasn't even  A big deal  In the end  I mean  And people are like  Oh my god  How can you say that  But look around man  Look at the big picture  Look at the big picture  Look around  They've got a Mardi Gras  Happening already  And the city  They relocated to Houston  But imagine  If hurricanes like Katrina  Started happening  More frequently  And all of a sudden 
[03:02:00]  More cities started  Getting hit with  Those kind of hurricanes  Then you've got  More cities  Than just New Orleans  Do you honestly  And you honestly believe  That because  We're doing  What  That we're making  No no  We're obviously  Doing something bad  Something bad  That is making  Hurricanes stronger  How are we making  Hurricanes stronger  I'll tell you exactly why  The way that heat  From the sun  Hits the atmosphere  Historically  It comes through  The atmosphere  Hits the planet 
[03:02:30]  Hits the oceans  Hits glaciers  And most of that heat  Usually goes back up  Into space  What's happening  With the burning  Of fossil fuels  And pollution  Is it's thickening  Up the atmosphere  And that heat  Less of that heat  Is going back up  Into outer space  And it's going back  Into the earth  And it's melting glaciers  It's melting snow  On mountaintops  And all that water  Is causing the glaciers  To melt  Is causing  You do know  The whole planet  Was not the whole planet 
[03:03:00]  But a lot of the northern  And southern hemisphere  Covered with ice  Really  Just about  10,000  15,000 years ago  Relatively short  Amount of time  In human existence  And what happened  To those glaciers  They pulled back  Why  Ungugu's campfire  Was throwing off  A little too much smoke  The rate at which  The rate at which  The climate of this  Of this planet  Is rising  Has happened  So much faster 
[03:03:30]  Over the last 20 years  Has it?  Yeah  I heard Al Gore say  That the 10 hottest years  So far in history  Have happened  In the last 12 years  Sure  That's one of the points  He makes  Doesn't  Maybe  That just happened  No  Don't you think  More  This is just a coincidence  It's a direct result  Of human  I like the whole philosophy  Too that  As the water's coming up  Like oh  Excuse me  Water's starting to come in  We need to do something  All the oil companies  Will just be like  Yeah okay 
[03:04:00]  To hell with those  Billions of dollars  Thank you  Switch this on Monday  As the mediator  I can't go with your point  Look  I can't  Thank you  The odds of that  Would be ridiculous  I think his nonchalant attitude  Is irresponsible  I think it's that  How long have we been  I think it's arrogant  To think that we've been  Keeping weather records  For how long  Really  Such a relatively  That's the point  I would have went with  Relatively  Very short period of time  That we've been keeping  I want to know  What the weather stats were  For the year three  Really  Give me the year three 
[03:04:30]  I bet there were 20 years  In a row that were hot  You know what he's like  You know who he is  He's the guy going  Right before the Titanic leaves  Not even God  Could sink her  Exactly  Shut up matey  Now he's got me  Killing people on a ship  Nonchalant  Arrogance  Could you at least  Make me the cigarette guy  That sits there and goes  You know  The medical community  Is really chastising us  And why do they want you  To stop smoking  It's all about 
[03:05:00]  Politics  No  I'm saying  Smoking relaxes you  This issue  How did they explain then  That in the beginning  Of the industrial age  When every state  In this fine union  And a lot of countries  In Europe  Were just pumping out  Coal  Everything ran on coal  We had more pollution  Over this country  Especially  Back in the 20s  And 30s  Than we do  Right now  I think  I'm actually trying to remember 
[03:05:30]  Because they do  They do address that  But one of the things  They do  Of course they do  You can drill  Into glacier ice  Much in the same way  That you would drill  Into a redwood tree  To track chemicals  In history  To see how old  The thing is  And they can check  The amount of CO2 levels  That were in the atmosphere  A hundred years ago  Right  Technological core sample  Exactly  And they can look  And see  Look it was rising  At this incremental level  Over this period  Of five years  To this period  Of five years  To this period  Of five years  All of a sudden  You hit the last century 
[03:06:00]  And it rises drastically  Yeah  And it's a direct result  Of human intervention  And scientists  Aren't refuting this  I'll agree with that also  You'd have to be stupid  To think  That all of a sudden  This new thing  We're doing  Burning fossil fuel  Coal  Powering things  Nuclear energy  Whatever it is  Is going to somehow  Affect the environment  I'm saying  How bad is it really  That we changed  I think  How bad is it  Underwater last year  That was a big hurricane 
[03:06:30]  That hit New Orleans  Don't blame it  On everything we're doing  It could have just been  A big hurricane  That hit New Orleans  Ocean temperatures rise  And you've talked about this before  The water's too cold up here  For there to be a hurricane  But the water is warming up  In southern parts  Of the southern hemisphere  For a few years  And then all of a sudden  It'll cool down  It's called an ice age  Three quarters in steel  Matey  Damn the torpedoes  More of these violent storms  Because the ocean's getting warmer 
[03:07:00]  Life on this planet  My point is  Life on this planet  Has constantly changed  The planet  Sure  Before we were even here  It changed it  I understand that  And it will continue to do that  Because we are the smartest thing  So far that we know of  That has been on this planet  Allegedly  Allegedly, of course  Things are changing  Yeah  We're very  We can adapt  The planet itself  I love when people say  We've got to save Earth  Believe me 
[03:07:30]  This planet will be here  For a long time  After even  We're gone  What's the  The cardlin line  The planet will just shake us off  Like a piece of bad fleas  Yeah  It's like a wet dog  Just get off  And then something else comes here  All the buildings we see  Out this lovely window  Gone  Some planet of the ape scenario  Where it's just piles of vine-covered dirt  After a while  That's fine by me  It's just the way things work  Oh, see, now I get it  He doesn't care  No  He doesn't  Fine, okay  That's what I was saying earlier  Because there's nothing to care about 
[03:08:00]  First I actually thought  He was saying  It's not happening  But now I realize  He's saying  He just doesn't care  And by the way  What's your point  He just doesn't care  What's your position here, people  Are we running out of oil  Or are we going to use it  Until we burn up the ozone layer  What's going to happen first  If we run out of oil  Hey, problem solved  Problem solved  There's no more fossil fuel being burnt  We can't screw up the atmosphere  Everything goes back to normal  If we don't run out of oil 
[03:08:30]  Hey, great  We don't want to run out of oil  But so many things are dependent on  Fossil fuels for their production  But if we're going to run out  Yeah  And then what happens to the environment  It goes back to being cool again  I think by the time the oil comes  One problem or the other  What's the big issue?  What's the biggest issue?  Running out of fossil fuel  Or the fossil fuel affecting the environment  He's saying both are a big problem  But only one can last long enough to affect us  Whatever is least financially destructive  To the companies that are actually  Drill Alaska dry 
[03:09:00]  That's what I say  Horrific  You ever been there?  Hey, hey  Have I ever been there?  I am a road hat, sir  I have been there  You've played the Gnome Ha Ha's  Like choo choo Charlie's  The Shuckle Hut in Anchorage  Yeah  Just dial 1-800-555  Brr  Well, this is going to get interesting  Because the director of Al Gore's movie  Is calling the show later today  Bring him  Davis Guggenheim  Bring him  Guggenheim  Been to the museum  I didn't see one dinosaur bone 
[03:09:30]  This is what I'm saying  By the way, Steve  He won't even be open  To this guy  He's already  I got my truck, Lottie  I have a big  I can put it in four-wheel drive  You can't get a bigger SUV than I have  I love it  And you know who I drive in it?  Me  Me, me, me  In the summer blockbuster disaster movie  He's that guy who creates the monster  And then it turns on him  Like, I made you  I made you  Exactly  By the way, Steve drives a hybrid 
[03:10:00]  As you drive your bike  Yes, he does  Yes  I certainly do  And I'm going to buy another one  Let me ask you something about those  Because I think those things are BS  Is it true that they only don't run on gas or oil  When you're not moving?  No, not true  That isn't true  At slower speeds  You can go completely electric  Yeah  Really?  How low?  It's electric  How fast can you go?  Like city driving  Like in the Toyota I have  You can go like 20 miles an hour  And you're not using any gas  I mean, it's when you hit the highway  That you basically  You get up to speed  And then you're using your electric motor to coast 
[03:10:30]  Those things are such a scam  Here's some audio of Steve  Driving in his hybrid  Put her down  Put her down, Steve  And  And look  Now it turned into a suitcase  And he carries it into his house  I back you, Steve  Uh-oh  I think you're on the right road  We got a physicist on the line  Jerome from Boston  Thank you, Jerome  Jerome, let's go  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey  This is a physicist 
[03:11:00]  What's up?  Thank you, sir  Yes  Wait, are you the guy that is a physicist  But it's from like a community college?  Exactly  Did you hear him?  He's not even  No, I'm not even kidding  There's a physicist that calls us  But he got his degree from a community college  Sir, can we have your credentials?  What was it?  Who knows?  It's Curry and Milton  Yeah, you've called the show before, right?  Yes  Yeah  I love this guy  Curry College and Milton  That's right down the street from me  That's from people who don't study in high school  Oh  And what college did you go to, Billy Burr? 
[03:11:30]  I'm not saying I'm a physicist  All right, enough  I'm not a physicist  I went to Emerson College  Wait  Better school than Curry  This guy is not  This  This guy is supporting you  I don't know, I didn't graduate high school  No, I know  He got his degree going to the 13th grade  13th grade degree?  I don't care  He's a physicist  13th grade, he gets a physicist degree there  He's a physicist and he agrees  This guy, I'm a brain surgeon  Brain surgeon, you're on line one  What's up, guys?  Steve's just mad because he does 40 on the on-ramp to the expressway 
[03:12:00]  And gets passed by everything  No, I know  And his foot is to the floor  I do not  My hybrid is  I can't  I can't get on the expressway  Here's him in the morning when the sun isn't up  Charging his solar panels  Honey, do you have any vinegar I can put in the gas tank?  Jake, I think that works  If I could get solar panels put on my house, I would 
[03:12:30]  But I just let him  Solar panels  It's great  If you read about this stuff, you get all your power from the sun, obviously  But it goes back into the grid  I got solar panels  You sell it back to the power company  You sell it back to the power company  Yep  Steve, you're totally making sense to me  Thank you, Billy  100%  Of course he is  Is it true you're building a windmill above your condo?  Oh, I love you  I got a windmill, man  I love you save the world schmucks  I can't get enough of you save the world idiots 
[03:13:00]  Look, I'm not  As opposed to what?  You morons in your SUVs with your guns?  Hey, we know what's right  Where did guns come in?  You know  You have guns  You have guns  When the floods come, I'm going to need them  You have guns  I'm going to have to shoot people out of Russia for my dry land  So what was your point?  Where did the guns come from?  You're home, you jackass  Exactly  What do guns have to do with this conversation?  Where did guns come into this?  He actually gets around  Don't you make me bring guns into this conversation, my friend  Because you're going to lose  You'll be at the losing end of that argument 
[03:13:30]  We're talking about pollution  He's got to bring my guns  I'm going to tell you right now  Why our side will lose  Is because this side  Mike makes right  Maniacs like him  We are armed  He, I swear to God, is two days without food  From just taking the AK to his neighbors  AK  It's an AR-15, my friend  American-made weapons  I don't go for that commie crap  Steve, you done or what?  Guns!  Alright, Steve's done  We're going to take a break  Thank you, Steve  Once again, let's not forget

[03:20:30]  Yes, Davis Guggenheim is on the phone  Hello sir  Davis  Hello, good morning  The executive producer of the new movie  No, no  Are you the executive producer with the Al Gore movie?  Director  Director, I'm sorry  Yeah, I went down one line too many  I'm sorry  I'm very jealous that you're married to Elizabeth Shue  Really?  Yeah, she's great man  You can try it for a day and then tell me what you think  Oh wow  Hey  I like that  Yes  Wow  She's actually nine months pregnant  She's due any day now 
[03:21:00]  Oh wow  Why would you  Together 16 years  Why would you bring another child into a world  That you seem to think is doomed  Within a week or two?  Good point  You know, it's pretty terrifying  The global warming thing  But if you see the movie  You see that there's a  It's pretty hopeful  If we all sort of start working on it now  If we start working on it now  Right  Now, that means  Cutting down on our use of fossil fuels? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, I mean  It's not just one thing  It's a bunch of things  It's a bunch of things  Because I had a point  Steve C  Who works here with us  Is a huge fan of the movie  He drives a hybrid vehicle  He's a tree hugger  He's gay  No, he is not  But there would be nothing wrong with that  If he was  Cuddly bear that he is  And  It seems to be  One thing  That we're running out of oil  An SUV  And collects guns 
[03:22:00]  We're running out of oil  Right?  Yep  And  The oil's bad  And  Is ruining our environment  And will lead to  A cataclysmic end of everything  As we know it  But  And the oil comes from a very dangerous place  And we've got to send soldiers there  Yeah  But the thing is  If we run out of oil  Doesn't that solve the problem?  Either we're running out of oil  I could see now  If there was so much oil  That oh my god  For thousands of years  We're going to be using this stuff  And you know  Change the planet 
[03:22:30]  But  If we're running out  Then we'll have to come up with something different  And problem solved  Well  You know  The problem is  It's a multifaceted problem  And I'm  I'm not an expert on this  I'm a filmmaker  But it's also coal  You know  Yeah  Coal fired plants  Are some of the dirtiest polluters  Weren't we using  A lot more coal  Back in like the 20s and 30s?  Yeah  And I think the bigger problem is  Yes  You know  We're  We're burning too much oil  We're also burning too much coal 
[03:23:00]  But basically  We're just consuming  Any way we like  Isn't that kind of our job though  As inhabitants  Top of the food chain on the planet  Like doesn't the planet  I see this planet  As like ours  For as long as it'll have us  No matter what we do  Like there really isn't anything  We can do  To stretch our time here  A little longer  Maybe we can cut it  A little shorter  It's like  It's like anybody else  You know  That's like it was  When I was  You know  In college  And we'd go 
[03:23:30]  You know  For a keg party  And we'd have  40 bucks  And we'd buy all donuts  And we'd just go the weekend  And drink all weekend  And by the end  You'd end up with nothing  And you didn't think about  Like perhaps  Maybe you needed  Some other type of food  For the weekend  And you didn't quite  Take care of the place  You were staying  Yeah I was in the same boat  As you  You described exactly that  But hey  Look where we are now  Yeah I mean  But the thing is  A better place  There are really simple things  That you can do  Yeah  That actually make your life better  Are they simple or inconvenient? 
[03:24:00]  They're inconvenient  That's why the movie's called  An Inconvenient Truth  But it actually you know  I'm not an environmentalist  You talk about tree hugger  I'm just not that kind of guy  Yeah  You know  I'm  But I  And  I went to  Gore  Gore gives this thing live  And I went to see it  And it just blew my mind  Because  Anthony have you seen the movie?  How powerful  No  The subject is  And how  You know  How I just didn't get it  I thought I knew a little bit about it  I didn't get it before 
[03:24:30]  Davis I have a question for you  Because a friend of mine  Knows a lot about this  And he was saying  Something along the lines of  Like a lot  There's a lot of alternative  Energy methods  Which are available  But it just seems that  People for some reason  Are always going with the older way  And it's like  Without using the newer sources  It just  It kind of contributes  And yet it makes the whole thing  Like a little bit more difficult  Yeah  And look at it this way  You know  You mentioned that like  The party we've had with oil  Is about to end  It's just 
[03:25:00]  All the indicators are there  Right  Yeah  You know  And this has been  You know  America has really  Been at the top of this game  For a long time  And you know  It's going to end  And someone  Some country is going to  Come up with the next thing  And if it's China  You know  They come up with the next  Fuel source  They'll just burn humans  Oh  That's their big resource  Baby girls  But the point is  Is that you know  Why don't we focus our energies  On figuring out  What the next thing is 
[03:25:30]  Well I've heard rumors  Clearly that the party's over  You know  I've heard rumors  That there's been like  Vehicles that run  On alternative fuel  And that a lot of times  What will happen  Is that the big companies  Will like  Try to like  Get the patents  But like  It's kind of hard  To like release it  Without that  Yeah there's a lot  There's a lot of theories  About that  And I'm not an expert  And some of them  Sound like you know  You know  Carbuncle  Conspiracy stuff  Yeah  But I do know that  You know  When we had  Our film came out  This institute in Washington 
[03:26:00]  Which we found out later  Was funded by ExxonMobil  Put out these ads  And the ad said  Something to the effect of  CO2  They call it pollution  We call it life  And the point is  Is they were just trying  To keep the controversy  Going  Because they don't want change  You know  And  They want to keep  Making their money  There needs to be change  It's all about the almighty dollar  But does  But does there  We're not spending any time  Or energy  Towards figuring out  What these new things are 
[03:26:30]  Do you think  If we ran out of oil  As a country  That we would just start  Walking around in loincloths  And  Not be able to  Figure out another way  To do things  An alternative source  Don't you slowly see  That there is  Sort of this migration  Towards alternate fuel sources  Now  With  That  The ethanol  And  Corn based  Fuels  And  All this  That it is happening  Well my wife  You know  There's a  There's a  Biodiesel pump 
[03:27:00]  Near our house  And she's like  Well there's a biodiesel pump  How come there's not more cars  Doing it  Well it's like  Well  Because if you drive  50 miles away  You're running out of gas  How are you going to fill your car up  Exactly  There's not enough of them  The point is  That there's  It's a whole system  That is locked in step  But that'll change  When it really needs to  Right now  We kind of  Have enough  But there's got to be more  Right  Well  I mean  That's where we disagree  Is that I think  You know  The writing has been on the wall  For a while now  You know  And 
[03:27:30]  If you see the movie  You see that  Because we're putting  So much CO2 in the air  The world is  Changing really rapidly  At a terrifying pace  Bottom line Dave  It's time to move  And get it done  Right  Yeah  And you know  You go to the movie  You go to this movie  You go to our website  And you learn a lot about it  And I think  You and your listeners  Would say  Oh  Okay  This isn't as complicated  As I thought  It's not as complicated  It's real  It's urgent  What  What would you say  But you got to get  Big business on the same page  Don't you 
[03:28:00]  What's that  You got to get big business  On the same page  Big business  Big business  GE  You got the college kids  That's easy  General Electric  Has  The head of General Electric  A couple months ago  Said that  He thinks that  Green is green  Which means that  They're going to  Focus their technologies  And millions of dollars  On research  Towards green technology  Well yeah  You know  BP  British Petroleum  Is out there  Advertising  How to reduce  Your carbon  Your carbon 
[03:28:30]  So you know  Things are changing  Our companies  Like ExxonMobil  Man  They're just stuck in place  Yeah  What do you think  The average Joe  Can do  The number one thing  That the average Joe  Could do to help  A John Q. Citizen  What can he do  Well you go on our website  Right  Yeah  And there's a thing  Called a carbon calculator  Oh  Uh oh  Yeah I know  It sounds complicated  I'm scared  But what you do  Is you look  And you see  How the choices  You make in your life  Create carbon  Like the car you drive 
[03:29:00]  Oh boy  Or the air conditioning  You use  I'd like to take this test  Yeah  I bet I score  Pretty high  Yeah but you guys  You know I mean  You got a pretty cynical  Attitude about this  But the point is  Is that if you wake up  To this  And you say  Look this is  This is a real problem  And I'm part of it  You know  Then you could say  Look this is a pretty  Easy way to do it  I bought a  I used to drive  A big Tahoe  A Chevy Tahoe  Now I've got a Prius  A Prius  See  And my Prius  How does that make you feel  Doesn't that make you feel 
[03:29:30]  Like perhaps you've  Emasculated yourself a bit  It's a fantastic car  He's married to  Elizabeth Shue  I know  I only drive cars  That chicks like  I have a Caddy  Because chicks like it  What does it cost  To fill up your tank  Two thousand dollars  Almost right  Mine is less than  Twenty bucks  And it goes  Four hundred fifty miles  It's unbelievable  Wow  Yeah but  It's a new piece of technology  And I look at these  Jackasses driving SUVs  Exactly  Exactly  Thank you sir  Thank you sir  You're talking to Mr. Jackass 
[03:30:00]  That's right  And I  I drive the Cadillac  Of SUVs  Right  What's that  Two years ago  I was driving a big Tahoe  So I was one of those  Jackasses right  Yeah  I'm just saying  That there's a  You know  There's a flip  And suddenly you go  Oh okay  This isn't so hard  I think it's  People who drive  Big trucks like that  I think  And I think you'll agree  There's a self-centeredness  In it  They're only concerned  About themselves  And the way things  Used to be in the 40s  And like  They're not really concerned  With the rest of the  Environment  Well look 
[03:30:30]  I bought a SUV  Because I have little kids  And I didn't want to get  In a wreck with a suburban  Oh yeah  See there you go  Right  So I had a real reason  To do it  And you know  And it's fun to drive  They're fantastic cars  Yeah  See what I'm doing  I'm burning  The fuel up quicker  So we have to find  An alternative  If you  People that drive  The Priuses  If everybody did that  There'd be fossil fuel  Burning for years  And years  And years  Longer than it should be  Yeah  I'm helping  It was interesting  It was interesting  How you were saying  That because of where 
[03:31:00]  The oil is located  How the problem  Is really Islam  I mean that was actually  A good point you made  Oh Jesus  I don't think he said that  He did  You don't want to be in that  Jesus Jimmy  Where is the problem  As far as where  They're drilling  Let me ask you guys  A question  Have any of you guys  Seen the film  Yes  Steve C saw it  Who has been talking  To you over here  Yes  Because the way  You're talking about it  Sounds like it's  Some sort of  Tree-hugging  Environmentalist  No no not at all  Raw raw thing  I just think 
[03:31:30]  If Al Gore's involved  It must be  Well you know  When you  Most people have  That expectation  But I think  When you go see it  You realize  It's actually not  One of these  Finger pointing  Michael Moore films  I'm going to go see it  Is that a fair assessment  Yeah I actually do  I enjoyed it  And I do think  That it's a fair  I don't think  It's tree-hugging  Or any of that stuff  It's just  It seems like  It would be on the surface  Just because of the title  And what it's about  But then you get into it  And you realize  It's a legitimate problem  And Al Gore  People actually find it funny 
[03:32:00]  And they find it  Entertaining  And they come out  Kind of  Charged up  It's not like  The end of the world  Type movie  I don't know  From the trailer  It looked like  The quick images  Of trees  And then a nuclear  Power plant  And gas  And stuff  I'm like  Ah  No no no no  Kind of scared  Oh no no Steve  No no no no  It's not like that  No it's not  That's just  That was the previews  Oh okay  That was for the omen  It's actually  You know  You know  Looking at the  Rock movie trailer  Yeah  They're running out of fuel 
[03:32:30]  That big gorilla  Is climbing a building  How is that going to help us  Wrong movie stupid  I know the movie  I'm going to check it out  I'm going to definitely  Yeah we're going to  Check out the movie there  Davis  Yeah it is a legitimate problem  I mean  We've got to do something about it  So I mean  I've heard the film  Is actually really good  Well thank you  I mean I've just  What state do we lose first  Though underwater  Florida  Florida's got to go first  Right  There's a bunch of them  In fact my neighbor  I live in California  My neighbor in Venice  Is going underwater  The southern half of Florida 
[03:33:00]  The Cape  And then you've got  You've got cities  Like in Beijing  It's unbelievable  How about like Michigan  Like off of Lake Michigan  Are they going to be affected  There's going to be more storms  There's going to be more erratic weather  I mean I think everyone  Must feel like  That the weather  Is just going crazy  This sounds good  The Arctic Ocean  Could be ice free  By the summer 2050  That sounds good  Yeah vacation  So there's  You know 
[03:33:30]  Yeah  It's  The problem is  Is that it's not just  Things gradually getting warmer  No  Davis you sound defeated  I mean let's  Let's go inside the interview  A little bit  Are you feeling a little defeated  Talking to you guys  Yeah  I hear you gulping  And getting a little uncomfortable  He's a director  And a fine one  I personally  Will be checking out the film  That's for sure  Do I sound like a  I think the point  I think the point I like though  Is that you're saying 
[03:34:00]  It's not like a Michael Moore film  And all that  A tree hugging type of film  You guys are taking  A different approach  It appeals to reasonable people  We showed this film  To reasonable people  A group of evangelical ministers  You know  These guys who are  Sighted with the  With the White House  On their energy policy  Uh huh  And they  And they  They love the film  Yeah  The film plays to  You know  You know  Reasonable people  You know  And it's not  It's not like a totally  We're all gonna die  It's like this is the situation  And this is what you can do  To fix it  And I was talking 
[03:34:30]  I can imagine people seeing it  And saying oh  This is one of  You know  Putting it in a box  And saying this is Al Gore  And this is a political  Yeah  Do you leave us with a little hope  At the end of the film  Like  Yeah I mean  The film actually  The end of the film  Is very uplifting  And it  And it leaves you with  Very simple things  You can do  Alright now I bring canvas bags  To the supermarket  And I don't use those  Little plastic ones  Is that a good thing  Does that knock down  My CO2 consumption  I lost you  You're fading out  He actually brings 
[03:35:00]  Bags with him  Canvas bags  To the supermarket  So when they say  Paper plastic  He goes neither  I already have mine  And he brings them  And you know  Uses them  Instead of the plastic  Or paper  So I'm sure  That's just helping out  That sounds a little  Gay to me  Oh yeah  Thank God  Thank you Davis  Now we like you  Now we like you  Thank God  What a creep  You must look like  Marching out  Those empty bags  Oh yeah  You look like a bag lady  I shouldn't have said that  No you were completely correct  I like the honesty 
[03:35:30]  No you gave  You gave into it  You became weak  I was trying to side with you  And you threw me under the bus  What city  I'm going to go see the omen  This weekend  I think he's the one voice  I can't hear for some reason  No Bill is gay  It's no big deal  What  Oh I know why  It should be down probably  Oh that  What city  Did you say is in deep trouble  It's sinking and all that  Beijing  What city  Beijing  What's the deal with Beijing  Well all these low lying countries  Like the Netherlands  Right  Yeah  They're more affected by sea level rise 
[03:36:00]  So  You know  If half of Greenland  And half of Antarctica melts  Sea level rise is predicted  To go up 20 feet  Yeah but then  You know  The gondola business  Will explode  That's true  See  Yeah I think if you  Take lemons  I think it's good logic  I can't argue with that  Gondola  Gondola business  With the guys with the big sticks  And they get to dress nice too  Wouldn't we just evolve  Into something with gills  Yeah  If too much of the planet  Becomes water  We just all of a sudden  Or water world  You know  I'm sure you would have

[03:37:00]  That they were going to  Bring on an actual expert  He's an expert on directing  And he's just like  I really don't know  What the fuck my movie's about  I was ready to start  Asking him about  Because he directed  A season of Deadwood  I was going to start  Asking him about that  All I wanted to ask him about  Was Elizabeth  Elizabeth Shue's hiney  And how good it looked  In leaving Las Vegas  Oh yeah there you go  Holy god  Was she sexy in that  Doesn't look that good anymore  Jesus Christ dude  Oh I'm sure  Why would you say that  This guy might be  Just a guest seconds ago  On our program  And you're insulting his wife  I think his wife is  Pregnastic

[03:47:30]  You know  I completely agree with you  It's still depressing  The words  Not at all  Come on little kids  With leukemia  You just get into it  65 when he dies  Sing along to it  That's a toe tapper  Sister Morphine  What's this about  We have a little taste  No  No  Alright good  Sister Morphine  Oh the time  Has come  No that's not it  Number 8  Sister Morphine  Brother John  No I don't think

[03:48:30]  Of Johnny Cash doing Hurt  This song is deeply depressing  I hurt myself  Here he goes  Hello  I'm Johnny Cash  Should have had  Joaquin Phoenix sing this  I hurt myself today  I hurt myself  Today  Did ya  To see if I still feel  Well do ya  I focus 
[03:49:00]  On the pain  Did ya  The only thing  That's real  Is it  The needle  Tears a hole  Does it  The old familiar  Sting  Is it  Try to kill it  All away  Do ya  But I remember  Everything  Do ya 
[03:49:30]  What have I become  My sweetest friend  Everyone I know  Goes away  In the air  Do they  Alright we get it  And you could have it all  Yeah could I  That's a great song though man 
[03:50:00]  Fantastic  Hey let's say hi to Rick  Another Canadian  Checking in  Lucky us today  Hey Rick what's up  Hey  Hey man  Hey  I'm telling you  We fucking love you guys up here  Thank you  We haven't gotten a lot of email from Canada yet  Rick what's up  What's up with that  Go  We don't have computers up here  It's cold  It's cold  They freeze up  The keys  Anyways  You guys don't know who Jim Carroll is 
[03:50:30]  You gotta know who Jim Carroll is  Of course we know who Jim Carroll is  Okay good  Basketball diaries my friend  You've never heard the song before  I've heard the song many times  I think we all heard the song  Isn't it supposed to be autobiographical for him  Like didn't he write the basketball diaries  That movie with that  Saget DiCaprio  DiCaprio  What  Saget  Wow  Uh oh  Sister Morphine is a Stones song  That was co-written by Marianne Faithfull  The Stones version is on Sticky Fingers 
[03:51:00]  Is that true  Yeah we got it now  Alright thank you Rick  What happened  Oh Iraq  Oh Iraq  You tell him the boss he's wrong Iraq  Alright hit it  He's right you're wrong  I hurt myself  Angel  She was getting a Metallica song  Yeah  Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da 
[03:51:30]  Can I have Mick Jagger show her how it's done? 
[03:52:00]  God, she has the worst voice ever.  I like her.  You didn't like her in the Metallica song?  What was the one she was about?  What was that fucking song?  Hated it.  Where she chimed in and ruined the song.  When Brewer was on SNL, I got to watch Metallica rehearse Fuel and that song.  It was like 15 of us in a room on the SNL soundstage, and Metallica came in and was rehearsing.  They had to time it out.  They were doing the same song like eight times just to get the timing right. 
[03:52:30]  And then Marianne Faith will come in and was helping them.  Whatever song it was, Fuel was one and the other one.  The Memory Remains.  The Memory Remains.  I hate it.  She ruined it.  And Hadfield was annoyed at her.  He didn't want to stand the next door.  Horace, get away.  Mick used to bang her, by the way.  Mickey Rivers, I mean. 
[03:53:00]  Not much better.  I like her version better, actually.  I don't like either version.  Not quite sympathy for the devil, is it?  No.  Systomorphine.  Systomorphine.  There's your ringtone. 
[03:53:30]  That's called pretzel bag.  Obnoxious.  Downward of Mars, Virginia.  That is such a great business right there.  It will be downloaded like crazy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  One more is on the front.  Oh, look.  Mother's calling.  Oh, God.  Number seven.  Most depressing songs of all time, according to this dumb book, I hate myself and want to die.  I love you.  Billie Holiday. 
[03:54:00]  Billie Holiday.  Strange Fruit.  Who's he?  I understand.  Strange Fruit.  Oh, boy.  Someone help us out with what these songs are about, by the way.  Help us on the instant feedback.  I think we know what this song's about.  Never heard the saying, strange fruit?  Something that grows on trees.  It's not supposed to be there.  It's strange.  Maybe that fruit was seen with a white woman. 
[03:54:30]  Ah, ah, oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Long enough intro, huh?  Don't stop treating me like a whore.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  How long does this intro go on?  Come on.  Get to the strange fruit part.  Is this an instrumental?  Do we even know?  Oh, is it?  I don't know.  There she goes.  He's a fag.  It's a girl.  And blood at the root.  No, the fruit, you idiot.  That she's looking at. 
[03:55:30]  Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.  Jesus.  A strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.  This is a little depressing.  It's good, though.  Who wrote this?  Oh, it hurts.  The natural scene of the gallant sound. 
[03:56:00]  The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth.  The scent of magnolia, sweet and fresh.  Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  Was this a hit?  Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck. 
[03:56:30]  For the rain together.  For the wind to suck.  For the sun to rock.  But for people who don't think things have gotten better.  Here is a strange and bitter crop. 
[03:57:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Now they all get back at us with that strange fruit in their pants.  The giant plantain.  That's a good tune, though, man.  I'm going to have to go to iTunes and get that.  Put that on your iPod.  Yeah, I listen to that.  I listen to Minnie Ripperton singing.  Loving You. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, but the fucking bird chirps wrecked that song.  It's the worst sound.  What did you do that with a Casio?  Fucking 75.  Love in you.  Charp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.  Charp, chirp.  Flutter, flutter.  Charp, chirp.  Another ringtone.  Of course.  Here's Captain Obvious.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, that's about a winching, isn't it?  Really?  Wow.  No, it's not.  It's not actually.  It's about they planted seeds for one fruit and another fruit grew and it's just depressing in the south. 
[03:58:00]  It's very strange.  Okay.  Did he really think he was enlightening us on that one?  He did.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim?  Because black bodies swinging from the trees wasn't exactly a tip-off as to what it was about.  Hey, guys, we need a collage of Steve's ringtones.  You know, a grrr in the hybrid car, all that.  Yeah, put those on foundry.  Yeah, we'll get a bunch of ringtones up on opiananthony.com.  That'd be great, dude.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  All right, so that song, yeah, that's definitely depressing. 
[03:58:30]  More depressing than the Jim Carroll band, People Who Died.  Number six, most depressing songs of all time, Blood Rock.  I've never even heard of this band.  That's E-rock when he's on his period.  We all are getting going.  Wow, yeah.  The wheels just started turning and Jimmy's already in first gear.  Jimmy is quick.  He's ripping down the strip.  Blood Rock.  Oh, why didn't you make a face before? 
[03:59:00]  Because his breath is awful.  Oh, no.  I was trying to be cool, but...  Oh, stop.  No.  I almost passed out.  Well, he leaned over because he was looking for something.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  Don't tell him when he gets back, though.  All right.  Trying to be cool.  Keep it under your hat.  Johnny from...  No, Snap Man from Whack Bag.  People Who Died is about people lucky enough not to hear Brett's call.  Loving you.  All right.  Here we go.  So, Blood Rock.  Chirp, chirp.  Sixth Place, a song called D-O-A. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, sounds creepy.  Oh, I've heard of this song.  Yeah?  This is like a...  This is one of those songs the rock stations like to play every Halloween.  Oh, really? 
[04:00:00]  Dead Body.  Like Monster Mash?  Dead Body.  It's Monster Mash in here.  I played this song a million times when I was doing the Rock Chalk thing.  Yeah.  Monster Mash.  Thanks.  Oh, what an awful song.  It was the graveyard.  The Monster Mash.  All right.  All right.  It was all in a flash.  Was it?  Really?  His uncle fucked him in the ass.  The Monster Mash.  The Monster Rain. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, it's the bubbling of the laboratory.  And my uncle took me down for some Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Oh.  His butt was in pain.  Oh.  Were you?  Did they?  Did he?  Did he?  He did the Monster Mash. 
[04:01:00]  The Monster Mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash.  Oh.  Huge hit.  He did the mash.  I don't know who I want dead more.  Him or the background people?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  On the car's release.  Wow.  Wow.  To the mosque in the bedroom where the vampires...  Somebody actually...  These women actually for years have probably been telling people,  You ever hear Monster Mash?  Yeah.  I'm backup singer.  I'm backup singer four.  They did the mash.  That's me.  You can hear me more than the other ones.  I like this version of Monster Mash. 
[04:01:30]  Yes.  Here I am, out for its throw, minding my own vampire business.  Hey, what's that noise under the porch?  I better investigate.  Oh my goodness.  Stop that.  I am scarred for life.  I can remember that.  I was walking one fine day when I first saw two young eager boys.  It's hidden under the porch.  One was little Jimmy Norton with eyes so round. 
[04:02:00]  He was on his friend's crotch making slurping sounds.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  With his little buggy eyes and soft little breasts.  Young Jimmy saw that he was making amends.  His hair was all sticky but he kept his pace.  Now we know why he likes hookers. 
[04:02:30]  To piss on his face.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  And little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The two boys were just having fun.  The monster rain had just begun.  The other boy's father caught them and he said.  Hey there.  What are you doing to my son? 
[04:03:00]  Hey young Jimmy.  Let me tassel your hair.  Why are you so sticky and covered in sweat?  Your spit-stained cheeks are so very bad.  When I just invented a game called The First Night in Jail.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  As an ass.  Little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  Now that Jimmy's a little older, he must repent. 
[04:03:30]  That he has such memories of rubber cement.  He should have protested and stated quite plain.  Dude, I'm not going to taste your DNA.  Oh no, you hear that?  Then at it again.  Man, that's disturbing.  I'm going to have to have my eyes washed.  Why would anybody even tell this story?  Little Jimmy Norton's a sociopath.  Very funny.  Hey, a couple of instant feedbacks coming in.  Rob from D.C. 
[04:04:00]  Please isolate Jimmy singing along with Hurt.  Funniest shit ever.  Yeah, we should make a little promo or something out of that.  Oh, you got it?  All right.  Hey, and then you got this asshole Surge Master from Wack Bag.  Of course.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Your show sucks and isn't funny because you assholes are sleepy.  Today, it's the worst.  The worst?  We've had much worse shows.  We've had horrific shows, sir.  I think today has been a very enjoyable show.  Maybe we'll rebroadcast them and remind you.  That's right, Surge Master.  All right, Surge Master.  Douchebag. 
[04:04:30]  So we're getting back to the most depressing songs of all time.  You know what's a good song by Johnny Cash, by the way?  Life Goes On.  No.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I'm trying to point out a song.  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  He's just getting a little fucking manners.  All right, here's number six.  So it's Blood Rock.  They play it every Halloween on a lot of rock stations.  It's DOA and it's a guy.  He's dead, but he's singing.  Oh, is that it?  From his perspective, yes. 
[04:05:00]  Does that happen?  It doesn't.  I think it's a really long song, too, right?  In a rock block.  Yeah.  It's long.  Yeah.  It's not that long.  We won't make it that far.  Sounds like it's long.  Yeah.  Laying here, looking at the ceiling.  Someone lays a sheet across my chest.  Is it a hotel?  Something warm is flowing down my fingers. 
[04:05:30]  He's singing dominatrix.  Pain is flowing all through my back.  Oh, hey, man.  This is horrible.  I'll get it.  I tried to move my arm, and there's no feeling.  And when I look, I see there's nothing there. 
[04:06:00]  Jesus Christ.  The face beside me stopped its holy bleeding.  The girl I knew has such a distant stare.  I remember we were flying along and hit something in the air. 
[04:06:30]  I remember we were flying along and hit something in the air.  Oh, plane crash.  Oh, plane crash.  Whoa.  So creepy.  Then I look straight at the attendant. 
[04:07:00]  His face is pale as it can be.  He bends and whispers something softly.  He says, there's no chance for me.  How is this more depressing than strange fruit? 
[04:07:30]  This asshole in a Cessna?  It's a John Denver story.  I was eating great nuts.  I hit the water.  We know.  We know.  We're sure you did.  I was in first class having a Sunday.  The rest of the filthy O&A crew was in the back where they belong.  Let's go to Eric in Kansas City.  Eric. 
[04:08:00]  Oh, so why would someone have been calling me?  Hey.  The most depressing song I have ever heard is Estrella by Brave Saint Saturn.  Hi.  What's it about?  It's about a kid who...  Oh, can I call you back?  I'm on the radio.  Who is it, Jimmy?  It's Laura Armstrong.  Who is she?  I'll call you back in a few.  Who stretches...  Who is she?  No.  I have a meeting with her after.  Funny.  Full of gelatin, and you can pull her arms real far.  Oh, shit. 
[04:08:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, you're on the phone, too.  Right.  Guard ahead, sweet angel.  Sorry.  You got to play a song called Estrella by a band called Brave Saint Saturn.  We'll get right to it.  Who's deaf and going blunt?  I am.  Okay.  What's the song called?  My Driving Test?  Sounds good.  Sounds good.  Fuck em.  All right.  Back to the real list.  Yeah, we're going to take a break, and we'll do the top five most depressing songs of all  time.  Although, who was the guy in the whack bag that didn't like us?

[04:10:30]  With just 124 days to go, until Americans choose a new president to shake up in Senator McCain's campaign.  John McCain has not put together a unifying theme yet in his campaign, but he has the potential to do so.  Senator McCain continues his three-day Latin American trip today.  Senator Obama taking the day off from the campaign trail.  Yesterday, he was talking about public service.  There's a lesson to be learned from generations who've served. 
[04:11:00]  From soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines.  And another story from the campaign trail.  Senator McCain denying that he roughed up an associate of the Nicaraguan president on a diplomatic mission in 1987.  We will continue to follow that and everything that moves on the campaign trail.  Don't miss a minute.  Come on over right now, Channel 130.  POTUS 08, where everyone is an insider.  What's on my XM, XM.  Good morning.  Welcome back to your XM on what is a getaway Thursday for much of the XM Nation ahead of the July 4th holiday tomorrow. 
[04:11:30]  I'm Paul here at the headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Well, we have a lot to keep you company no matter what your plans are today.

Another birthday for the good old USA, and XM celebrates musically with Uncle Sam on XM 120. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, yeah, dude, it's summer.  That means we've got to buy fireworks.  XM presents a musical melting pot of songs all about America for the 4th of July.  This is my American dream.  I don't want to bum me out, but I'm the future of America.  Starting tomorrow at midnight Eastern, it's 24 hours of American music for the 4th.  Uncle Sam on XM 120.  Hey, this is Rick D's, and my original weekly top 40 countdowns from the 80s and 90s are back.  Weekly top 40! 
[04:13:00]  Welcome to the hits, and welcome to the weekend.  Three weeks at number one for Janet Jackson.  They dreamed of being number one.  Two, the red hot chili peppers.  It's a party across America.  Listen Saturday mornings at 9 east on the 80s on 8, and Sunday mornings at 9 east on the 90s on 9,  right here on XM Satellite Radio.  He's in the weekly top 40s!  Here's Opie and Anthony, and they aren't stinking. 
[04:13:30]  Ooh, who took their shoes off? It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, top five.  What, Opie?  Most depressing songs of all time.  Yeah.  We finally hit good old Terry Jacks.  Terry Jacks?  The one-hit wonder of Seasons in the Sun.  Oh, we had joy.  We had fun.  We had Seasons in the Sun.  What's sad about that?  You had some fucking fun at the beach.  A little fun.  What's wrong with it?  Where does it go wrong? 
[04:14:00]  I don't know.  Goodbye, my friends.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, maybe it starts bad.  Goodbye to you, my trusted friend.  We've known each other since we were nine or ten.  All right.  I want you to hit him over the head with that old Leslie keyboard.  Climb trees.  Climb trees.  Learned of love and ABC.  Climb trees.  Skinned our knees.  Goodbye, my friend.  It's hard to die. 
[04:14:30]  There we killed Mark the monster.  And all the birds are singing.  And I'm singing.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  We had joy.  We had fun.  We had a mouth full of the sun.  But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time. 
[04:15:00]  Goodbye, Papa.  Please pray for me.  Why?  Oh, no.  I was the black sheep of the family.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  You tried to teach me right from wrong.  You disciplined me with your veiny dong.  It's over, Jenny.  It's over, Jenny.  You cannot look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I'm singing in the sky. 
[04:15:30]  Now that the screen's in the air.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Little children everywhere.  We're cakes for nothing.  When you see them, I'll be there.  We had joy.  We had fun.  We had seasons.  But the wine and the song, like the seasons have all gone.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  We had fists in our bums.  But the wine and the song, like the seasons have all gone. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm Michelle, my little one.  Oh, the little one saying goodbye.  You gave me love and helped me find a son.  Did your parents have any children to live?  Sir, yes, sir.  How about they regret that?  You would always come around and get my feet back on the ground.  Goodbye, Michelle.  It's hard to die.  Just do it.  When all the birds are singing in the sky. 
[04:16:30]  Oh, you little maggots.  You make me want to vomit.  Now lean forward and choke yourself.  I wish that we could both be there.  Your days are finger-tagging.  All of Mary's game buttons, right?  Through her pretty pink pennies, are over.  Pretty fucking time, sweetheart. 
[04:17:00]  You both know us.  You folks go on your face.  That's a hard one.  All right.  Why does this keep coming up like this?  You folks go on your face.  No shit.  Did the guy die?  Apparently.  In real life?  I don't... 
[04:17:30]  His career did.  What's that song about?  Can someone get me a bio?  Quick, quick, quick.  He's dying.  He's saying goodbye to everybody.  But is it from someone else's point of view or his?  I don't think it's his.  No, because no.  It was Terry Jacks.  He wasn't dying.  But who's Michelle?  He named people, so it's got to be from someone.  Yeah.  Imaginary family.  Goodbye, Michelle, my little one.  My little one.  Well, that's number five.  Most depressing songs of all time.  Goodbye, Franny, my neighbor.  That's all right.  Who's lawnmower I never return?  Goodbye, my mailman. 
[04:18:00]  Always there for me.  Goodbye, milkman.  Thanks for the extra cream.  We get it.  You are loved.  That's for tomorrow.  Go fuck yourself.  We'll do that tomorrow.  Make sure you remind me.  Goodbye, grandmama.  And your smelly feet in diapers.  Yes, I know Nirvana did a cover of that song.  Yes.  Did they?  Number four, Anthony.  Number four.  Jimmy.  Most depressing songs ever.  Bonnie Tyler. 
[04:18:30]  Total Eclipse of the Heart.  What's wrong with that song?  What?  Turn around.  Bright highs.  No, which one is that?  Turn around.  What's wrong with the song?  Every time I...  It's a good song.  Something, something.  Every time I...  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La.  Well, let's see where this goes wrong.  I've heard this song a million times.  I had no idea it was a depressing song.  Suck this cock.  Turn it off.  I can't hear this. 
[04:19:00]  Ooh.  But you're going to start there.  And there.  But not here.  Every now and then I get a little bit lonely.  That's her uncle.  Is it a heartbreak or something?  Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening.  To the sound of my tears.  Turn around.  You know what it is?  She's really drunk and she's squatting and shitting on the floor and leaning on the toilet 
[04:19:30]  with her elbow.  Someone telling her, hey, turn around.  She's evacuating all over the tiles.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I'm going to ask you.  Turn around. 
[04:20:00]  Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit angry at the door and I see not cry.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes.  This lady dies singing to her ex-husband.  Every now and then I fall apart. 
[04:20:30]  Every now and then I fall apart.  And I need you now tonight.  And I need you more than ever.  And if you only hold me tight.  We'll be holding on forever.  And we'll hardly be making it right.  Who are you?  Because we'll never be wrong.  Together we can take it to the end of the night.  So love is like a shadow on the all of the time. 
[04:21:00]  I don't know what to do.  I'm always a doubt.  It's just like heartbreak.  We've had a bunch of death and destruction and this is just like heartbreak.  He never turns around.  Who cares?  He doesn't turn around.  That's the problem.  Bright eyes never turn around.  Is she saying turn around or is the guy saying turn around?  It's like he's saying.  Who's saying it?  Who cares?  But he's going turn around.  Like maybe I'm right here.  I think that's just a thought.  It goes unanswered.  There's no eye contact.  She's the one that's heartbroken.  Why is she calling them bright eyes?  Who is she?  Sinatra? 
[04:21:30]  Turn around, babe.  Turn around, you classy dame.  That's number four.  Fucking asshole she is.  That's number four.  Most depressing songs of all time.  Bonnie Tyler.  Totally clips of the heart.  I'm going to guess what number three is.  All right.  Happy birthday.  To me.  It's somebody called Bobby Goldsboro.  Oh, no.  Which one is this?  Oh, I know it is.  I know this one.  What's the title?  You're a liar.  Honey, there's a lump on your tit. 
[04:22:00]  What's the title?  It's called Honey.  Honey.  Is it?  I was joking.  Yeah.  It's called Honey.  That was a complete goof.  Honey.  Oh.  And it's about him.  I think she dies.  She dies.  Sure it's not about Steve's lunch?  Honey.  I forgot how the tune of it goes.  If I knew, I would probably know every word.  All right.  Let's take a listen to Bobby Goldsboro, Honey.  Got it.  Space, The Final Frontier. 
[04:22:30]  It goes like Pink Floyd's Money, but instead of Money, they say, Honey.  Honey.  See the tree.  How big is grown, my friend?  It hasn't been too long.  It wasn't big.  I remember this song from when I was a little, little, little kid.  I laughed at her and she got mad.  I punched her in her fucking face for laughing at me.  Because it wouldn't get hard.  I've been drinking, you castrating pig. 
[04:23:00]  She ran out to brush the snow.  You put a few pounds on.  So it wouldn't die.  See, she went to, they planted a tree.  She brushed the snow away so it wouldn't die.  Came running in.  All excited.  All excited.  Slipped and almost hurt herself.  Almost.  Very close.  And I laughed.  And he laughed at her almost slipping.  That's funny.  She pulled a muscle in her back.  She was always young at heart.  Kind of dumb and kind of smart.  She was an easy lay.  Jesus.  She's a clumsy retard.  Retard.  She'd shit her pants and wave her medals, wear a Pete Rose hairdo and spoil the family 
[04:23:30]  pictures.  Two years ago.  Jesus.  What else did this enchantress do?  And it would sure embarrass her when I came into work in the room.  Fucking useless cunt brushing snow off tree roots.  And she'd have peanut butter on herself and the dog was there.  But she'd be sitting there.  He'd lick her pussy and fuck her throat.  We'd laugh and make eye contact.  Here it is.  And honey, I miss you. 
[04:24:00]  Haven't gotten to the part where she dies yet, though.  Oh, he's singing this to the tree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'd love to be with you.  Then kill yourself.  If only I could.  All right.  I think the death scene's coming.  Uh-oh.  Hold on to your hats.  How'd she die?  She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad.  And I was.  My insurance premiums went up and I had a kicker in the uterus. 
[04:24:30]  It was a Saturn and I couldn't cruise trannies for a while.  She was pinned against a tree, causing a ruckus.  She came home unexpectedly and caught her crying needlessly in the middle of the day.  She's a fucking psychopath, retard, clumsy bitch.  There was a stewed tomato on the floor to repaint that room again.  She went away and, honey, I miss you. 
[04:25:00]  She's kind of crying and then she drops dead.  She has something, I guess.  And I'm being good.  I'd love to be with you, but I'm busy repainting the nursery.  We'll make it an office like we originally planned.  We made the nursery an office and the chick that I was really looking at moved in last night.  I know you've only been gone three days, but what the heck, I've got to get over it sometime. 
[04:25:30]  When I was growing up, that song was like on the radio when I was a real little kid.  And it was on all the time.  I don't remember that one at all.  And then me and my brother used to make fun of it when we got a little older.  Yeah.  Sort of like we were just making fun of it, make up the wrong words.  I've been doing that shit since I was like four years old.  What, the lyrics?  Making up just the awful words to the song.  So she crashed a car because she had something wrong with her.  She was home crying and then dropped dead.  Yeah, she was home crying.  Apparently she had something. 
[04:26:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, they never get into it, but she dropped dead.  All right.  The runner-up.  Most depressing songs of all time.  According to this book, I hate myself and want to die.  She wore a robe and drank some broth.  Alice the maid and Sam came home.  But wait, she's not a man.  We have Harry Chapin.  Harry Chapin.  Oh, my God.  Cats in the Cradle.  No.  Taxi.  If it's Taxi over Cats in the Cradle?  No.  Cats in the Cradle.  30,000 pounds of bananas? 
[04:26:30]  I've never heard of this song either.  Track the trailer on the LIE.  Is it Dreams Go...  Is it Oopsie Daisy Bumper?  Don't tell me it's W-O-L-D or fucking Dreams Go By.  How do you know all these Harry Chapin songs?  I love Harry Chapin.  He was amazing.  Ha, ha, ha.  I know what it is.  It's fucking...  Ah, wait.  It's, uh...  It's not Mr. Tanner.  It's about upstate New York.  It's about the fucking, uh...  Uh...  I am the midnight watchman. 
[04:27:00]  Down at Miller's Tool and Die.  That's probably the one.  What's so sad about that?  It's about a guy...  It's not a shitty job, but at least he's working.  He has a one-night stand.  He's a very lonely...  A Better Place to Be.  It's called The Aids.  It's a song called The Shortest Story.  Never heard it.  How old is the oldest song, like, on the list?  Is it, um...  Are there new ones?  Not really.  Because there's one.  Don't tell me if it's on it or not, but The Christmas Shoes.  Have you heard of that one?  The Mabel King song?  Way to fucking wreck the whole bit. 
[04:27:30]  I didn't say...  Give me a clue whether it's...  Way to wreck the whole bit.  I didn't say...  Opie, what did I say?  I said, don't say if it's on the list or not.  I couldn't help myself.  Look.  See?  Now look what you did.  Bill Burr's not here, so you decide to be a bit wrecked.  I didn't ruin the bit.  You ruined it by not, not reacting.  I want to hear the shortest story.  I never heard that Harry Chapin.  All right, let's do Harry Chapin, and then, of course, the number one most depressing...  Oh, I ruined the bit.  I love it.  It doesn't matter.  Good.  That's right.  Take out your tissues, you melodramatic jizz buckets at home. 
[04:28:00]  Get ready to dab your eyes.  Ryan faggot.  That's right.  Boo fucking hoo.  Let's play the shortest story.  Harry Chapin.  Shortest story.  Is that Voss's fingers?  Big A's cock.  I am born today.  The sun burns a promise in my eyes.  Mama strikes me, and I draw a breath. 
[04:28:30]  Is this a real-time story of his life or something?  There's less than two minutes left.  Oh, I hope there's a fucking small toy involved that shouldn't be eaten.  Oh, no. 
[04:29:00]  I taste the hunger, and I cry.  The blinds string to the blinds that you're supposed to sniff at the bottom.  That yummy paint chip.  My brother and sister cling to Mama's side.  She squeezes her breast, but it has nothing to provide.  She shoots a fart like a lupy cushion in the kid's face.  What's wrong with Mommy?  Is she poor? 
[04:29:30]  Maybe it was Daddy, and he's fat.  Maybe the kid wanted to win, and he's a little hungry.  It's 20 days.  My body, nothing, RCS.  It's 20 days.  Mama does not hold me anymore.  I open my mouth, but I am too weak to cry.  Up on me, a bird slowly crawls across the sky. 
[04:30:00]  Why is there nothing now to do but die?  Whoa.  He's ripping off Neil Diamond.  Yeah, it really does count a little Neil-ish.  That is not that sad.  Who knows?  The kid had fucking some kind of problem?  No, I think the mother had a problem.  Just neglected him?  Yeah, neglected.  Drug act, whatever. 
[04:30:30]  But fucking Cats in the Cradle is a much sadder song than that.  Like the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon.  Fucking kid, he teaches him to throw the ball, and he went, I want to be like you, Dad.  And he's getting fucking fresh.  And he ends up just like his dad.  He's busy.  Being a piece of shit that's too busy to be with his son.  It's just about life getting busy.  He's like, eh.  No, you could take some time.  He long since retired.  My son's moved away.  A man is never a true man unless he spends time with his family.  That's a good point.  But he fucking called him up the other day, and the kid's got the flu. 
[04:31:00]  The kid's got the flu.  What are you going to do?  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  That's the way you teach your kids.  Time to die.  Die.  The most depressing song you've ever heard, according to I Hate Myself When I Die.  Can I guess?  Go ahead.  I'm going to guess.  Go ahead, Anthony.  The Christmas Shoes.  My daughter married at...  Well, forget it.  Oh.  I didn't say what. 
[04:31:30]  No, I don't...  I never heard Christmas Shoes.  It's a song by...  New Song?  I don't know.  I heard, like...  Like, you know, Sal?  My mom and Sal?  Yeah.  Sal just will burst into tears spontaneously during this song.  Are you kidding?  Around Christmas.  He's a pretty tough guy.  Yeah, but Sal's just gotten older.  You know, the old days when we used to be out on the boat, he's cruising around the Great  South Bay in this huge Sea Ray, drinking CCs, drunk, getting all hammered, cruising through 
[04:32:00]  the fog.  Laughing at shit, who cares?  Right.  Skipping through life with your shoelaces untied, you know?  And now, you know, Christmas Shoes come on and...  Oh, this is...  Oh, this is so sad.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Ro.  All right, why don't we...  Baldingmore accent.  Baldingmore.  Why don't we listen to a piece of...  Ro.  That's fucking the accent.  Ro.  Ro.  Why don't we listen to a piece of the Christmas Shoes by New Song?  All right?  Shoes.  The most depressing song you've ever heard.  Day is never finished, Massey got me working, someday Massey set me free. 
[04:32:30]  And listen to you communists and niggers and Jews, tell all your buddies to spread the  news, today your judgment will soon be nigh, as the Lord in his wisdom looks down from  on high, will his battle be lost by mixing the races?  We want beautiful babies, not ones with brownies places.  Never, never, never I say, for the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay. 
[04:33:00]  Never, never I say, for the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay.  That ain't it?  No, I thought it was.  I actually have the most depressing song you've ever heard over here.  Right?  You got a little confused.  Okay.  Here it is.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers. 
[04:33:30]  They claim to be wild Indians from the plains.  This is not the most depressing song ever.  It's the most depressing thing to happen to the neighbor.  That's not right.  That is so wrong.  No, I mean the house being sold.  I just want to go on record and say that that was suggested by our own true boogie.  It was not.  Don't lie to us.  I deny everything.  You did not just write that down, huh?  Oh, my God. 
[04:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Teresa in Florida.  Teresa.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What do you say, Terry?  Teresa.  Oh, that song was horrible.  There's a sadder song out there than any other song.  It's Flowers for Mama by Red Sovine.  Oh, Flowers for Mama.  Yeah, Flowers for Mama.  By who?  By Red Sovine.  Sovine.  Trucker singer.  I never heard that.  On truckers and talking to me.  How does it go? 
[04:34:30]  Oh, God.  Just a little bit.  See, I might have heard it.  I kind of tell you what it's about.  No, just sing a little.  Oh, just a version of it.  Who cares?  Just a little verse.  Oh, no.  You guys want to make fun?  No, I actually want to know the song because the title is familiar.  Yeah.  Flowers.  Sing it.  Sing it, Teresa.  Sing it.  Sing it.  It'd be great.  I can't remember the words.  It took me like a half an hour to think of who sung the song.  Ha, ha, ha.  Someone got a pitch pipe?  You got a pitch pipe? 
[04:35:00]  Clear to feel some men.  They're going to do some drinking.  Go ahead, Teresa.  You can sing it.  All right.  I can't sing it.  Here's Teresa.  She's going to sing a little piece of the song for a while.  And, Teresa.  Go.  You're on.  Go.  Just a little bit.  Every second that ticks away is valuable radio time.  Let's go.  Teresa.  Flowers for Mama.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Perfect.  I hope she's still belting it out as a trooper pulls her over. 
[04:35:30]  All right.  Can we hear a...  Yeah, let's hear the number one.  This is new song, The Christmas Shoes.  Let's listen to the most depressing song you've ever heard according to I Hate Myself and Want  to Die.  Very touching.  This dumb book.  Aww.  And Sal really cries.  Oh, yeah.  Like by this part, he'll be bawling.  Christmas Shoes by Paul McCartney. 
[04:36:00]  Christmas Shoe.  It was almost Christmas time.  And there I stood in another line.  Trying to buy that last gift or two.  Not really in the Christmas mood.  Because I'm a Jew.  Right in the front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously.  Oh, what's wrong with the boy?  The boy.  Basing round like a little boy.  That's probably Chomolester.  And in his hands he held a pair of shoes. 
[04:36:30]  A pair of shoes.  The kid's got some shoes.  And his clothes were worn and old.  Yeah, old.  He was dirty from head to toe.  And when it came, it's time to pay.  I couldn't believe what I heard him say.  Here it is.  Hold on to your hats, kids.  Sir, I want to buy these shoes.  Yeah.  For my mama, please.  Please.  It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size. 
[04:37:00]  Could you hurry soon?  Hurry.  Daddy says there's not much time.  Not much time.  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  Look.  Oh, she won't be needing new shoes then, will she?  Why don't you buy her a Christmas diaper? 
[04:37:30]  How about a New Year's Eve satin pillow?  She wants a shoe so she has nice shoes.  Oh, fuck.  I'm stealing like the black kids do.  Oh.  Now he's looking at the guy.  Mama made Christmas good at our house.  Most years she just did without.  Tell me, sir, what am I going to do? 
[04:38:00]  So how am I going to buy?  Here's what he told him.  You had best to fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck.  So I laid the money down.  Oh, I just had to help him out.  And I'll never forget the look on his face.  What'd he say?  Mama's gonna look so gray.  So gray?  You're a liar!  That's right.  Goddamn liar!  What, do the shoes match the outfit you're going to bury her in? 
[04:38:30]  Fucking depressing wave.  And these shoes are just her size.  They're just her size.  Could you hurry and see?  Hurry up.  They're small because she's Japanese and Daddy binds her feet with blocks.  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  And I know these shoes will make her smile.  And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight. 
[04:39:00]  I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven's love as it backed me and ran out.  What does Mama have?  You will be molested.  I hope Mama doesn't have cancer.  You should get her a Christmas wig.  What is this all about?  Sir, I want to buy these shoes.  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that? 
[04:39:30]  I'm in love with me.  As Mama's illness drains the inheritance, you better trip over that Christmas plug.  Did you hurt me so much?  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  Yeah, we got it.  Get up, you giant man, y'all.  Oh, what's wrong with her?  You need to shut the fuck up. 
[04:40:00]  Sad.  Put on Nikes and then castrate her like fucking Marshall Applewhite.  The shoes so she can catch the spaceship.  This song stinks.  Goddamn rich cunt. 
[04:40:30]  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Oh, that was like one of those fucking Little Marky songs.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go to Leroy of Pennsylvania.  Leroy.  Fuck Mama in her new shoes.  Let her just lay there and fucking bum everybody out as usual.  Fuck Mama.  Somebody ought to call Bob Kelly.  She'd be crying right now.  Of course, he's humping a sink.  Mama's a fucking downtrodden cunt with the sniffles.  Tell her to tough it out and fucking be sick in January.  Ruined Christmas for everybody.  Exactly.  Self-centered twat, Mama. 
[04:41:00]  All right.  Well, there you go.  Little kid can't even buy shoes.  He should be taught to shop.  If Mama was so good, she would have raised him to shop in November.  Right.  Not Christmas Eve during the rush.  What do you think, Jesus wants to see someone come up to heaven and fuck me?  Put those away, kid.  They're inappropriate.  They're like fucking Roman sandals where you fucking tie them all the way up.  Horseshoes.  Horseshoes.  She goes up to St. Peter and he won't let her in.  Take off those horseshoes and put on heavenly loafers. 
[04:41:30]  Who gave you those?  We're going to kill him immediately.  Oh, the saddest, uh, there it is, song ever.  That song eats ass.  Fucking Christmas shoes.  Oh, fuck yourself.  This is Paul Provenza here, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's going to be a long show.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
