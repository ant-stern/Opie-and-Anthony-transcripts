<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their controversial reputation.  The hosts launched into a discussion of Columbus Day, filled with offensive jokes about the treatment of Native Americans.  This segued into a critical, and often insulting, review of various U.S. presidents, particularly targeting Obama and Bush.  The conversation then turned to the Yankees' playoff run, Anthony's recent fandom, and the phenomenon of fair-weather sports fans.  They extensively complained about the downsides of watching playoff baseball, including the cold weather, commercials (particularly Viagra and alarm system ads), and late game times.  The awkward post-fight workplace atmosphere following an internal conflict on Friday was also briefly mentioned. The show teased an upcoming Halloween event ("Fur Fright"), a claimed world-exclusive new Michael Jackson song, and more commentary on sports and commercials.

The broadcast continued with observations about Ed Begley Jr. walking by the studio.  They then heavily criticized the new Michael Jackson song and movie trailer using highly offensive language.  Miley Cyrus's departure from Twitter was speculated upon, followed by a discussion of a promotional shirt the hosts deemed "girly."  A lengthy segment focused on a video clip of Meredith Vieira's reaction to a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" contestant, with the hosts using vulgar and sexually suggestive language, and making crude jokes about her husband's illnesses.  The show included graphic descriptions of a man with a severely deformed tongue observed by one of the hosts, followed by a phone call with Dr. Steve for medical explanation. An anecdote about a man with poor hygiene on a plane was also shared. Ed Begley Jr. appeared in studio later, contrasting his environmentally conscious lifestyle with Anthony's high consumption.

Ed Begley Jr.’s in-studio guest appearance began with a discussion of his mother's hoarding and his own similar tendencies, linking it to a Neanderthal survival instinct. He discussed his environmentally conscious lifestyle shown on "Living with Ed," including his use of incentives to influence his wife's car choices and his use of alternative energy. He recounted being arrested for impersonating a police officer, his substance abuse struggles in the 70s, his friendship with John Belushi, and his near-death experience that led to sobriety.  He also discussed his work on "St. Elsewhere" and Christopher Guest films.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a restaurant owner using a racial slur ("nigger") on a sign, leading to a debate about censorship, the First Amendment, racism, and the media’s handling of controversial topics. The segment concluded with a "Backstage with O&A" segment detailing a recent staff fight.

A significant portion of the show focused on a backstage blow-up between Steve and Danny, stemming from a disagreement about Steve’s breakfast,  and Jocktober, mocking other radio personalities, particularly Carson and Kennedy. The "French fries go in the basket" running gag was revisited.  Extensive mockery of Carson and Kennedy, including mispronunciation of their names, was featured, alongside listener calls.  The 40th anniversary of DJ Ross Gibb playing "Revolution No. 9" backwards was mentioned, along with a caller’s experience with gastric bypass surgery. An upcoming interview with Ross Gibb was promoted.

The interview with Russ Gibb, responsible for the "Paul is Dead" rumor, was filled with highly offensive, sexually explicit, homophobic, and racist remarks from both Gibb and the hosts.  The conversation included sexually suggestive comments toward Gibb, and crude jokes about interracial relationships. A caller, "Uncle Paul," participated, adding to the vulgarity.  The segment concluded with a return to "Andy Rooney's Weekly Beat," maintaining the crude and sexually explicit humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Come on, Opie and Anthony.  I got stuff I read every day, but I don't remember it after I read it.  I have to remember two things.  Gun laws and age of consent.  Some on my stomach.  Just relax, you're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  Nothing's going to come out. 
[00:01:00]  And I fucking push out like...  You fucking won.  Your fucking dick smells like eight different vaginas at any given time.  You got fucking millions.  You won.  You motherfuckers are singing a Barry Manilow concert.  Are you ready?  Let me hear you make some noise.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Another live show for everybody today.  Yes, on this Columbus Day, I believe it is.  Yeah.  It's a holiday.  I guess.  We don't know what the holidays are because we work them.  Yeah, they really don't give us off for the holidays.  We work the holidays.  We get the big ones.  When I don't see Howard's limo, I go, oh, it must be a holiday.  That's what I do now.  Some type-O holiday.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Columbus Day.  Big parade here in Manhattan. 
[00:02:00]  The Italian parade?  Hoopla.  Yeah, it's mostly an Itralian parade.  People with their Italian pride.  Columbus came over here and butchered everyone.  A lot of people get angry.  Like, oh, he discovered America.  How did he discover a place where there's people living and stuff?  They were savages.  They were savages.  We came over here.  Well, you know, they did.  But they were already here.  Doesn't matter at that time.  You can't discover a place where people are already living.  They can.  What if there's fucking microbes on fucking the moon? 
[00:02:30]  Who's to say the Indians were savages?  I am.  They seem to, like, be in touch with nature.  They were one with nature.  They had a travoid.  They were very spiritual.  Travoid.  They didn't even have a wheel.  They had a travoid.  What's a travoid?  That's that thing they dragged behind a horse because they couldn't figure out how to make  a wheel.  How do you not figure out how to make a wheel?  Ah, exactly.  You got to be European.  I mean, even cavemen, when they were throwing rocks down hills and stuff, went, wow, you  know, the ones that are in this weird shape seem to move a little better down the hill. 
[00:03:00]  Later, they'll call it round.  Right.  I don't know.  It's just a, it's a ugg.  Yeah, this strange ugg shape.  It's ugg shape.  Much better than that other shape that we now call square.  Yeah, yeah.  It's better than that.  Yeah, that's a travoid right there.  What the fuck?  That's what they did.  Hey, dummy.  Hey, Cochise.  Put a fucking wheel on the back.  That must have been tiring for the horse.  No shit.  To drag that behind itself. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I'm sure the Indian horses weren't none too happy with that thing.  But, you know, Columbus, he comes over here and, you know, sees some shit.  He goes, all right.  I claim this in the name of.  Of whatever.  You know, the Europeans.  Right, right.  You know, Spain and Italy and all that happy horse shit.  And then people get mad at him now and don't want it to be a holiday.  And there's always controversy on Columbus Day that, oh, he's a murderer.  But shut up.  And that's how the world worked back then. 
[00:04:00]  You can't do it now.  But back then, it was fine.  You know, there was a point where every single human being was a murderer.  Exactly.  If you go back far enough, I think every person alive was murdering.  You just clunk them on the head with a rock.  You didn't have someone walk into your cave and just say, hi, can I share some fucking  saber-toothed tiger meat with you?  They didn't know how to socialize.  They knew how to murder each other.  I think the murder rate.  And they'd go, and just bash him in the head. 
[00:04:30]  I think the murder rate is drastically lower since caveman days.  It's really dropped.  Oh, it sure has.  You either killed someone or you were being killed.  Yes.  End of story.  There was no football.  There was no playoff baseball.  No.  There was no Twitter.  There was no YouTube.  It was a lot of murder and rape.  That's it?  That was all that we started on as cavemen.  Murder and rape.  You would rape another caveman's woman.  Yeah.  Then you would murder the caveman, and then you would take everything they have in their 
[00:05:00]  cave.  And then you have the kids who grew up to become murder and rapists.  Right.  Yeah.  So, and that was nature.  So, why are we going against nature?  I say everyone start murdering again.  Murder.  Murdering and taking.  Well, that's what this government does.  Man.  I love the man.  Government does man.  I had a weird dream that Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize as he's fighting two wars.  Wow.  That was a little weird, huh?  I had the same dream. 
[00:05:30]  That's a dream, right?  Well, no, it's actually not.  That's not the Nobel Prize.  That's the he's not Bush Prize.  That's all that was.  That was it.  Exactly.  So, they should call it that.  That's all it was.  He's not Bush.  Let's give him a fucking peace prize.  But, I mean, he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize, basically, as he's at a table trying to figure  out what to do with the two wars.  Whether you agree or disagree with his decision making, he is trying to make decisions about  wars as he's receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. 
[00:06:00]  Somebody was saying, well, he got the Nobel Peace Prize because of his attitude and his  promise to make a better place to live and everything, and his attitude and how he's  going to bring people together with it.  And then Bennington fucking wrapped it up.  The guy's a genius.  He goes, yeah, and I have a movie where you leave the theater and you're crying and you  go home and you tell your family about it.  It's just a wonderful movie.  It's great.  Give me my Oscar now.  I haven't made the movie yet, but just give me the Oscar now. 
[00:06:30]  It's a good point.  It's a great point.  He has, I like Obama, but he has not earned a, I think he was embarrassed by it, to be  very honest with you.  I don't think he feels like he deserved it.  I believe that.  He tried to spin it like so, because he knows.  It's just ridiculous.  Who was he up against?  Exactly.  I know.  Hitler and Bin Laden.  All right.  Give it to Obama.  Actually, you missed the joke.  He was up against a guy named Ted.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes. 
[00:07:00]  Nobel Peace Prize.  It was between Obama and a guy named Ted.  Mr.  Sheckler should have won.  I certainly, I wrote myself in, Anthony.  They never consider me.  Because they told me I spelled peace wrong.  P-I-E-C-E.  Oh, you thought it was a Nobel Peace Prize.  I certainly did.  Like a slice or something.  He didn't do anything.  Well, I guess it's lost its credibility, this Nobel Peace Prize.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  You can't look at it the same way. 
[00:07:30]  This is how they look at Obama and the United States.  As you know, he went around for the first couple of months of his administration just kissing  ass and apologizing.  And they look at that like, wow, there we go.  He's not George Bush.  Are you trying to say you don't like Obama?  I'm not a fan of the president's policies.  But you are a fan.  I don't.  I actually, truthfully, he doesn't come off as a bad guy. 
[00:08:00]  Like, I don't think he's this guy that gets behind closed doors and just does the  mwahaha evil thing.  Right.  But I don't think he's qualified at all to be president.  And I think he has an agenda that is based very much on his personal life.  Much like, you know, Bush did the same thing.  He brought that goddamn fucking religion into his administration and no one wanted it there.  And Obama's bringing his own personal foibles to the presidency. 
[00:08:30]  Who was the last president that was qualified, though?  That was qualified?  Yeah.  Reagan, I thought, was qualified.  Qualified to be the president of the United States of America.  George Sr. because he was head of the CIA.  George Sr.  What about Clinton?  You know what?  I think Clinton was qualified.  Yeah.  Clinton qualified?  Well, he ran Arkansas into the shitter for quite a while.  I don't know, qualified.  As far as a Democrat goes and being a Democrat, he did a job like a Democrat does as far as president goes.  And he wasn't bad with his peacemaking abilities. 
[00:09:00]  Like, he was able to sit two assholes down in a room, Middle Eastern and Jew assholes down in a room, and sit there and go, all right, guys, you know, knock it off for a little while.  But I'll tell you, Clinton was good at this.  Clinton was good at making you feel like, Reagan made you feel safe, but Clinton was a Democrat, but you still felt comfortable with him.  Like, you know what?  He wants peace, but if there's a problem, I felt like Clinton would take care of it.  I didn't feel like he'd be a pussy.  He lobbed some cruise missiles into a few places.  Obama frightens me, though. 
[00:09:30]  I don't trust him at all with foreign policy.  It makes me very nervous.  Yeah, he really doesn't know much about it.  What other presidents weren't qualified?  Weren't qualified.  Would you say Bush Jr. there?  Would you say Carter?  Would you say Ford?  Would you say Taft?  I would say being the governor of Texas, I think, makes you a little more qualified.  But, I mean, he was the president during a rough-ass time.  Yeah, but he inherited what Clinton gave him. 
[00:10:00]  No, the thing is, with 9-11 and having to deal with a couple of wars that were completely supported at the beginning and then completely not supported at the end, you really come off looking like a villain.  He came off looking very badly.  He handled it very badly.  There was a lot of cover-up and bullshit things going on during his administration.  But as far as being qualified, I think so.  Having his father in the presidency, seeing what that was all about, having his father as a head of the CIA. 
[00:10:30]  I think also he used to go and have little chit-chats with him over stuff like that.  So I think as far as being qualified, being qualified doesn't mean you're a good president.  No, it does mean that you do have what it takes where people would go and go, all right, he does seem to have the experience to be the president.  I don't think Obama does.  I really don't.  He's a little new.  All right.  He's a little new.  A little. 
[00:11:00]  But I don't know, are any of them really qualified?  Like who?  Like Reagan.  Reagan was, I thought, was just a great governor of California for many years.  Even that head of SAG, things like that.  Like knowing how to handle things politically.  I think he was very good.  He moved up among the ranks.  And he knew how to use his power.  He had a good resume heading into the presidency.  He knew how to use his power as president and the power of the United States to get things done.  But again, different time, different fucking enemy, all that stuff. 
[00:11:30]  Also, what I'm saying is, was he qualified or was it his ability to communicate?  Because Reagan was such a good talker and people liked him.  Yeah, yeah.  So was it just that?  Like is it his qualifications or just that he could communicate and get stuff done with a Democratic Congress and Senate?  You know, going over and dealing with, you know, he had to deal with, I think, three heads of the Soviet Union during his presidency.  Brezhnev, who was just one of the real old school fucking commie leaders.  But he was able to go over there and they actually did talk things out. 
[00:12:00]  It was, that's what a president used to have to do.  Now it's impossible.  I mean, what the fuck?  And I'm not even blaming Obama for this.  Europe just doesn't want to fucking hear it anymore.  They don't want to go over, they don't want an American president to go over there and tell them what to do in any way, shape, or form.  Reagan, during the Cold War, could go over to Germany and say, look, here's this big red motherfucker knocking on your door.  We're the only, we're the only thing keeping them from just marching all over your fucking stupid split in half country. 
[00:12:30]  And now, France is another one.  Oh, whatever, whatever.  Now, you know, the president, Secretary of State goes over to Europe, they go, fuck you, we don't even want your money anymore.  You know, it's a whole different time.  So it's very difficult, I think, on the president right now.  And for somebody like Obama, I don't think he has the experience.  But again, what would be the experience in this new Europe, this United Europe? 
[00:13:00]  So who knows?  Yeah, the whole game is changing.  There you go.  All right.  So Obama and his fine Nobel Peace Prize.  Let's get into sports.  My God, your Yankees did the job last night, Anthony, huh?  Yes, they did.  Yes.  Were you celebrating with the team now that they're your Yankees?  You know, I've heard this for so long.  I've had Twitter wars about this.  I don't remember you ever really liking the Yankees until this past year. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  It's very strange to Jimmy and I.  Who used to get fucking insults and things thrown at me when we were at AAF?  Because I remember, boys, boys, let me let you in on a little secret, Anthony.  You have to just make like you're a Red Sox fan.  Like, what?  Mm-hmm.  We were told to, like, root for the Red Sox when we were up there by fucking Brucey Mittman. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And I'm like, no, I'm a fucking Yankee fan.  Right.  And I'm not going to root for the Red Sox.  And it's funny you say that today because just a quick little off-roading and then we'll get back to this.  I was watching the Islanders and the Bruins on what night was that?  Fuck, I don't even know anymore.  Saturday.  Saturday night, I guess.  And the Islanders blew a three-goal lead in the third period over the Bruins, end up losing in a shootout.  It made me fucking sick because the Islanders have a young, scrappy team.  I'm kind of liking what I'm seeing, but they're not getting the job done. 
[00:14:30]  They're playing two out of the three periods.  They're playing some good hockey.  Okay?  Whatever.  Yeah.  So I say I'm sick that the Islanders lost his game to the Bruins after being up three to zip in the third period.  Some guy writes, he goes, it breaks my heart being an old AF listener that you're rooting for New York sports teams.  I'm like, do I have to make this perfectly clear?  Anthony and I are from Long Island, New York.  Grew up.  We did time in Boston.  You know, I take a peek at the Boston teams, absolutely, because of our time up there. 
[00:15:00]  But the fact is, I root for my New York teams.  Yeah.  Yes.  And that's how it is.  And back when we were at AF, you're right, Bruce Midman kind of wanted us to be rah-rah Boston fans.  Yep.  And fuck that.  And then, so I'm having these battles on Twitter with people telling me that I'm a bandwagon jumper.  So then I say, you know.  Well, you kind of are.  You used to be a Mets fan.  No, I wasn't.  I remember.  I was a Mets fan, I think, when I was eight.  Actually, to go back to the Boston days, I remember you on the rock bus. 
[00:15:30]  We had a bunch of warm teenagers around us.  Oh, yeah.  We were at Spooky World.  Spooky World.  Spooky World.  Spooky World was closing up for the night.  Yep.  And we had the Yankee playoff game on in the rock bus.  In the rock bus.  And Anthony was cheering like a mofo.  Because, and they say, oh, you're a bandwagon jumper.  And then I say, no, I'm not.  And then I talk about my years of being a Yankee fan.  And then it's like, okay, well, then you're a fair weather fan because I haven't heard you talk about the Yankees in a while.  Well, there hasn't been anything to talk about in the past couple of years. 
[00:16:00]  I've gotten on here and talked about how shitty it is to have to fucking sit through the Yankees' sucking ass.  We've talked about everything with Torrey being fucking going to Los Angeles last year.  Like, all that shit got brought up.  But what was there to talk about?  Hold on calls.  Yeah, what was there to talk about?  A-Rod sucking in the postseason?  Not this year.  If they got to the postseason?  The big choke of 2004?  You don't think, remember me and a certain little twitchy producer going crazy on each other talking about the 2004 fucking meltdown of the Yankees when they fucking blew it against the Sox? 
[00:16:30]  Can I point something out?  And I agree with you.  It's amazing as a man what an insult it is to be called a bandwagon fan.  It is.  But it's so weird.  It's like I'm thinking of this like, who cares?  I'm not saying it to the conversation.  No, you're right.  But I've been like a little fair with it because I had a bad experience.  But they're like, who gives a fuck?  Like if some guy said to me, you're a bandwagon jumper. 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  What would happen next?  Where would it go?  But dude, it's just, it's what?  Explain to me.  You are right.  That is the way to handle it.  Everybody's fair weather.  And it leads into something we've discussed over the years that why shouldn't we be fair weather fans if the athletes themselves are fair weather players?  Exactly.  Well, how would you put it?  When the money's right, they're there.  When the money's not right, they're not there.  These guys aren't loyal.  These guys jump teams every single year except you get a rare exception like a Derek Jeter or something. 
[00:17:30]  But in general, your superstars are jumping around the league like crazy.  So why shouldn't we be able to jump around the league?  It makes people feel better about themselves if they've watched the team when they won 40 games for the season.  I was there.  Well, then you're an asshole.  Oh, I was doing fun shit.  You are, Jimmy, you are so fucking right.  I should have just said, you know, yeah, and.  Yeah.  But here's my last Twitter from last night. 
[00:18:00]  I'm a bandwagon jumper?  Yeah, listen to old AAF shows.  I have audio of me being a fan for years, dickhead.  Drown your sorrows and your kids.  Wow.  Jesus.  The guy just wanted a healthy little argument with you.  Oh, my God.  I know.  What the fuck?  So A-Rod got the job done.  He got a homer last night.  He went boom.  A-Rod has actually come alive during the postseason, which is.  He's got a bunch of RBIs, huh? 
[00:18:30]  An A-bomb from A-Rod.  Right.  And Georgie juiced one, which was huge.  And the Twins, oops, great pitching if you're into that whole thing.  I don't like seeing a lot of goose eggs for the first, you know, six, seven innings.  You're just like, all right, great.  You know, it's good if you like watching pitching.  And, oh, the pitcher's duel.  But, you know, you kind of want to see a ball get hit every so often.  I'm so glad that hockey's here and football's here. 
[00:19:00]  I could care less.  Playoff baseball's fantastic.  No, I'm actually taking a peek.  Fantastic.  And then after the game was over, that fucking Phillies-Rockies game comes on.  And how do you fucking play baseball in that cold?  Wasn't it like I was there the night it was supposed to be played, and they canceled it because it was so cold.  It was 22 degrees.  It was 30, 31 degrees last night when they played.  Put a dome on the fucking thing.  They should just kick those teams out of the league.  I agree.  Or put a dome on the stadium.  Or go, look, you're not allowed to play in the playoffs, but you can play in the regular season just to make it fun for everybody. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  But you're not a playoff team.  I'm sorry.  Well, Minnesota.  Because you play in the snow.  Minnesota decided, you know, that was the last game for the Twins in the Dome.  Now they're going to have an open-air stadium in fucking Minnesota.  But will it be able to be covered now?  Hold on.  Nope.  No.  By the way, speaking of that,  three to four inches in Minnesota today.  So if they were still in it, wouldn't there be another game?  They have a domed stadium.  Oh, right, right, right.  Until next season. 
[00:20:00]  Starting next year.  Right, right.  I'm sorry.  Right.  But your point is right, though.  What would happen next year if that happened?  That's sort of what I was getting.  That's the point.  That's right.  You shouldn't let them without the ability to put a dome over it.  Well, don't they do that for the Super Bowl?  I wouldn't.  No.  Isn't the Super Bowl only played in stadiums either down south or domed?  Yeah, it can't be snowed out.  No, they make sure they keep it warm for the most part.  Yeah, I mean, really.  I think it's a policy.  Yeah, Miami.  Yeah, the toys in.  Well, I don't think it's fair that you – the baseball season is, what, ten and a half months 
[00:20:30]  long in some ridiculous amount of time?  And then it comes down to you freezing.  You can't even feel your hands, and you have to now try to have a good game.  It's ridiculous.  Yes.  Who won last night in Philly?  That was the Phillies one last night.  Oh, the Phillies one.  That's right.  It went back and forth, though.  That was a good game, too.  What time did that game end?  Oh, fucking late.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  A few hours ago.  It started after the Yankee game was over.  When did the Yankees end?  So it started, like, after ten.  Jesus.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Well, that's two hours' time difference.  I was asleep for two hours already.  I know.  If you're on the East Coast, you're a Phillies fan trying to watch it.  You're like, uh –  Well, they're suffering today.  Falling asleep.  I was fucking in Denver.  Oh, then again, they're not, because most people have today off.  Ah.  It's Philly, too.  How many people actually work there?  Let's be real.  They actually work hard out there.  Ah, fuck.  They're bums.  A bunch of bums.  A lot of Phillies fans are a bunch of douchebags.  They're a bunch of bums.  Your team has stripes on it, but they aren't fucking Yankee blue.  Because I bleed Yankee blue. 
[00:21:30]  Do you?  Oh, and the 50th anniversary uniforms for the NFL were hysterical.  You see the –  You see Denver?  Terrible.  You see Denver?  Terrible.  They were all tigers.  Rawr!  It was so bad.  They had the stupid numbers on the side of their helmets.  And then they wore these socks that occasionally, if they twisted, it looked like the Wicked Witch feet,  that curled under the house.  That was what the socks were like.  It was –  It was horrible. 
[00:22:00]  But they beat the Patriots.  Yes, they did.  That was a pretty good game.  That was fun, too.  You see Bill Belichick with his pom-pom on the top of his winter hat.  What was that about?  The officials all dressed with the orange stripes.  Well, last week they all had pink.  Yeah, for breast cancer awareness.  Yeah, there was a lot of pink in the NFL last week.  Not as much this week.  Wait, they have fucking – the teams are doing social awareness stuff now?  Oh, dude, like the NFL was all about it.  There was pink – I mean, some guys were wearing pink socks. 
[00:22:30]  Yep.  It was pink all over the place last weekend.  Not as much this past weekend.  I don't know if I like that.  Like, I like the – the idea behind it.  Well, they're just trying to save tits, Jimmy, you know.  No, I'm off – oh, you know what?  Because breast awareness month, too.  Yeah, they're just trying to save some tits.  Save the tits.  You know –  It was on the big scoreboard.  Save the tits.  So, you know.  You know what else looked ridiculous?  I remember the old Pat's fucking logo on the side of their helmet, dude.  It's like, look, I'm in the Revolutionary War, but I'm ready to hike the ball.  So, what are you doing?  I'm a patriot. 
[00:23:00]  That's also a center.  Well, they played football back then.  Of course they did.  They played football.  Look at me.  The British are coming.  Hike.  I can look so –  And he has no helmet.  No.  You know how fast that would get knocked off his head?  Oh, the dumb hat, the three-point hat he's wearing gives no protection.  Where were the graphic artists back then?  That's the best thing you come up with?  That's horrible.  So, uh –  I like the Cowboys' old uniform, though.  Not just because I'm a fan, but I like their old uniform.  Like, when Don Meredith used to play, like, yeah, I like those all from the 60s.  Dandy Don. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Where was it?  Dandy Don Meredith.  Have some iced tea.  Fuck.  What were some of the other bad uniforms yesterday?  I mostly focused on the Pats and the Broncos game, seeing the silly Denver uniforms.  Well, the Giants won, too.  They're undefeated.  Yeah.  They played Oakland, though.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  What a blowout.  Come on.  There was another blowout yesterday, too.  But Eli Manning's little foot injury held up, so –  He didn't even have to play the whole game.  No, he got –  Took him out, like, halfway through and said, fuck it. 
[00:24:00]  We're kicking their asses.  And Brett Favre turns 40, and his Vikings are –  That was it.  5-0.  Brett Favre is 5-0.  Yep.  Thanks.  Thanks for last year, you dickhead.  The motherfucker's on fire.  Being a Jets fan, that's just ridiculous.  He's 5-0 this year with a healthy arm or a healthier arm.  Ah, whatever.  Oh, Favre had 232 yards passing.  Favre. 
[00:24:30]  And you forgot to mention that it was a tough day for Boston, man.  Angels sweep the Red Sox, and they got the Pats losing to Denver in overtime.  Well, at least the Bees won.  Oh, well.  We had that fucking game, man.  So frustrating.  You know –  Did you watch that game at all?  No, no.  I know you're not a big hockey fan, but –  No, I can't deal.  I got football and baseball is, like, enough, really.  This is going to be a good year for hockey, I'm thinking.  There's a lot more fighting, I noticed.  Yeah? 
[00:25:00]  The games I've been watching, yeah.  Yeah, they're letting them brawl a little more.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Good.  I was so fucking annoyed at the ump in yesterday's game because the run that the Twins did get  was completely based on a fucked call from the ump.  I'm seeing some really bad strike calls and ball calls.  That's because you have HD.  Yeah, no shit.  Maybe the fucking ump should get HD eyeballs. 
[00:25:30]  When you have that HD, you notice how bad they really are calling balls and strikes.  You just sit there and you watch and you just go, what the fuck did he just do?  Now, you know, guy walks, he steals, he winds up scoring, and the guy would have been out.  Would have been fucking out.  It was a strike.  Eh.  I guess it goes both ways.  It doesn't matter.  You're going to have a tough time with the Angels, though.  Everyone says that.  Historically, because of the Angels.  I don't care if the Angels won eight games this year.  Seven of them were against the Yankees.  There's always been a problem with them on the West Coast teams.  Always.  When does that series start? 
[00:26:00]  They rest a couple days, right?  Yeah.  Like two days or so?  Three days?  I think they will do very well, though, against the Angels.  Because I was watching the Angels playing the Sox.  Watching that game.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, just seeing, oh, God.  Also, we got to play the fucking Dodgers.  That Joe Torre.  Oh, my God.  What a, just a miserable motherfucker he is.  Really?  Oh.  You like this Girardi, because he shows emotion, huh?  I like Girardi.  You know something?  Because it wasn't all that long ago that he played, and, you know, he still kind of remembers 
[00:26:30]  that shit.  Well, it's still new to him.  And it's just, yeah.  Joe Torre's won, what, 8,000 games?  I mean, to him, it's like, whatever.  He's made a few, Girardi's made a few questionable calls.  Uh, Friday night's game was amazing to be at.  I was at, at the stadium, as I like to call it.  Yeah?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, watching that game Friday, and wow.  It was, like, over.  Bases loaded, like, no outs, twins are fucking up. 
[00:27:00]  They shut him the fuck down, and then wind up winning the game.  Uh, but early on, uh, I think the inning before that,  uh, Girardi kind of made a little mistake, uh, eh.  What was his mistake?  Uh, he, he, he kind of, uh, uh, let, uh, Damon, uh, he should have, he should have had Damon  bunt just to get a run in.  Um, he didn't.  Was there a run-around second with nobody out?  Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty sure that was the, uh, that was the play. 
[00:27:30]  But it was just kind of a weird thing.  But, you know, like Hope said, he's, he's new, new to this.  It's kind of exciting.  And it's cool to see, like, I love, I love, uh, the guy that's excited about it.  I love the younger coaches.  When you see.  They seem to really get into it.  Did you see the celebration when, uh, uh, Denver won?  Oh, no, no.  Did the coach lose in his fucking mind in front of everybody?  Pumping his fist, running around the field?  Like, just rocking and rolling, man.  He was so happy. 
[00:28:00]  God damn.  There's a lot of history there, but he was just so freaking into that win yesterday.  Girardi was catching Pettit, and he was catching Rivera.  He caught both of those guys.  When you, when you see, uh, Torrey, though, sitting there, just kind of chewing, just looking.  And it doesn't matter what happens.  It does not matter what happens.  He has that same, just like, I'm here again.  I'm here again.  Yeah, this is great.  I'm, I'm getting a text from, uh, somebody in Philly. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You know.  Uh-oh.  Well-represented in Philly.  They're not happy with your comments, but that's okay.  They're all blue-collar workers down there.  Philly fans are monsters.  Uh, game ended at 2.30.  2.30.  Because we asked, uh, when the game ended?  2.30.  Wow.  2.30 in the morning, the Phillies game ended.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Why can't we figure out that time zone thing?  Make it good for everybody?  Yeah, just keep the sun in, uh, right over the United States at all times.  The problem is, they didn't want to compete with football, I guess, right? 
[00:29:00]  Is that what, what happens?  Yeah, they could have played earlier.  They just, why not?  Just play earlier.  I don't think they wanted to compete with the Yankee game.  No, I understand that.  I'm just saying, maybe make the Yankees earlier.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Figure something out that, that makes more sense than a game ending at 2.30 for the team that's  in it.  Yeah.  It is, uh.  It didn't matter if you're in Colorado, because that's like a normal night for you, but when  you're playing a team, now you're asking a whole city to pretty much pull it all  nighter.  Stay up until 2.30 in the morning.  Pull it all nighter.  Great.  If you really want to watch the game, exactly.  Like, how, why can't Major League Baseball figure that out to make it make sense for 
[00:29:30]  everybody?  It's just, it's just silly.  You're a bandwagon jumper!  Yeah, you fair weather fan!  Yeah, I definitely am.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Then what?  Then what happens?  God, that is good.  I'm just using that one now.  Fuck it.  We, uh, we, uh, we move on to movies and Jimmy's, uh, Jimmy's movie, uh, number one at the box  office.  Of course it is.  Congratulations, Jimmy.  I have no doubt that it would be.  Uh, Couple's Retreat.  Of course.  Congratulations, uh, Jim Norton, for, for calling that one. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  Looks so funny.  How could it not be?  Every time the commercial goes on, pops on this, on, on the TVs behind us here, Jimmy  loses his mind.  Very funny.  Because he knows comedy, right, Jimmy?  It's very funny.  What do you like about the new movie?  You just, because it's like, wow, there's couples that are going away for a fun time,  but you just, you're kind of like, oh my God, that's going to go wrong, that's going  to go wrong, what's going to happen?  I think the girls are going to get mad at the guys, and the guys will want to do some  guy thing, and the girls will catch up.  You know, it's going to be fun.  Did you see the one, you see the one scene where there's a misunderstanding, and the big 
[00:30:30]  black guy gets nude in front of everyone else?  No, they must have been gassed and shocked.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch out.  Oh, that's a hell of a scene, I bet.  Made 35 million at the box office.  35 million.  Beating out Zombieland, which has been out there a week or two now, so.  Because that's one of those.  Yeah, Vince Vaughn's got another hit on his hands.  Even though everyone is paying that movie, but, you know, we're just dumb lemmings that  just march to the movie theater because the TV tells us what movie to watch.  Man, that's the good one.  That's the one that the chicks could take their guys to, and the guys won't argue that 
[00:31:00]  much because it's not like a chick flick.  It's a hysterical comedy.  You know, all you have to do is a little research online, and you could go and see some really  good movies out there that you'll never hear about.  You know, I call it the Smoked Salmon Theater, the artsy theater I go to in my neighborhood.  The artsy, fartsy theater?  You don't hear about any of these movies, but you just read the synopsis and some reviews,  and you go, holy shit, this sounds way better than anything that's at the Horseshit Theater.  I know which one you mean, right?  Just the one on the right when we're walking?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, what's the movie that made, like, fucking... 
[00:31:30]  I say it's a Smoked Salmon Theater because they literally give you Smoked Salmon instead of  popcorn.  That's how weird this place is.  Who the fuck wants to eat Smoked Salmon while they're watching a movie?  I don't.  No, you still want the popcorn, which is the dumbest invention ever because everyone  sounds like goddamn locusts as they're feeding on their popcorn.  Oh, is it Paranormal Activity?  I think that movie was made for about $30,000.  Oh, is that the Blair Witch Project type movie they're talking about?  Yeah, and it's made $7 million.  It's a hell of a nice investment, man. 
[00:32:00]  What?  Fucking A.  Oh, it's already made...  Well, more than that at this point.  About $8.25 million.  Made for $30,000.  What movie's that?  That's Paranormal Activity.  It looks pretty scary, as far as that Blair Witch kind of style goes.  But I like when they show the night vision view of the audience for the trailer.  Oh, right.  To show you how scary everybody is.  And people just losing their fucking minds.  A lot of that fast coming at you shit happening with a kind of a shaky video channel. 
[00:32:30]  You see a trailer?  I didn't see it.  Is it not good for radio?  Budget was $11,000.  Oh, $11,000.  So it wasn't even $30,000?  Budget was $11,000.  How do you do that?  Jesus.  Goddamn brilliant.  $11,000 and you turn into $8.25 million.  That's a great story, though.  You've got to love that.  Four days until Fur Fright and is Sam going?  What the fuck?  It doesn't really sound like it.  He's not so into this one.  Jesus Christ.  Fuck him. 
[00:33:00]  He said something like how it wasn't his bit.  I'm not on team, Sam.  Who's bit is it?  You're the boss.  Make him go.  What's the questions?  You should say it's Fur Fright.  Oh, cool.  He's going.  He should go.  Now you go.  That's our Halloween bit.  Yeah, we have such peace and love here among the staff.  I think that everybody should be getting along.  I got reports in fucking Colorado that there was issues.  Well, it's a very dysfunctional place because it was an all-out war on Friday and then everyone  comes back to work on Monday.  No one has seen each other since and it's like business as usual.  Like it never even happened. 
[00:33:30]  Why is Sam wearing an Opie and Anthony girl shirt?  I think that's the only one that fits him.  Yeah.  It's the only one that really fits him.  Ugh.  Little young Sam.  Look at him.  Why are you wearing an O&A girl shirt?  That's a girl shirt.  That is a girl shirt, dude.  Dude, that is such a girl shirt.  That's like a little bippy shirt.  It's a tiny little shirt.  Yeah.  This is a men's size medium.  There's no fucking way.  No.  That's what it is.  No.  No. 
[00:34:00]  Not buying it.  It is.  A men's size medium.  We can check the tag.  You got the Opie and Anthony panties on too?  I don't wear panties.  Why aren't you doing fur fright?  Panties.  I said from...  Yeah, what happened?  You're not fucking a trooper for the show?  I said a month and a half ago, if I had to go, I would go, but nobody has done anything  but say, yeah, go.  Yeah.  What am I...  I'm not going to...  So go!  Well, that's the...  If you have...  If...  Yeah.  I'm not going to buy tickets. 
[00:34:30]  Nobody's supplying any tickets.  Who runs the...  Is the company fucking giving us money for fur fright?  I don't know.  It's our big Halloween bit.  Steve.  Where's Steve?  Steve?  But I mean, that's...  That's the way it's got to happen.  It's got to be...  I think everyone is just staying in their corners today.  How's the staff today?  Just walking around like nothing happened Friday, Sam?  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Everybody is just...  I was interviewing people earlier.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You're putting something together?  Yes, I am.  Oh, good.  I think everybody is just... 
[00:35:00]  A little postscript to Friday's...  Yeah, just to catch everybody up to what's happened.  Everybody, you know, with the issues that they've made up and...  Right, okay.  And all that stuff.  We look forward to that.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Who started the fight on Friday?  E-Rock.  Was it E-Rock?  Definitely.  About what?  Well, E-Rock was taking pictures of Steve's breakfast.  And he's been doing it for a while.  And then Steve got wind of that and lost his shit.  Why?  And was really, really pissed off.  And I don't know.  Just listen to the replay.  It went on for a long fucking time.  Oh, see, this looks scary. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  Because Steve is very sensitive to the fact that he's still overeating.  Yeah, he said E-Rock hit a nerve because the food addiction was the one addiction he couldn't...  Yeah, it's a rough one.  But were they taking aerial photos of his giant breakfast?  Might as well.  Those are some big-ass burgers.  You know, and there's a hoo-hoo happening.  Arnold Schwarzenegger tweets pictures of his breakfast.  Where did he get that idea from, young Sam Roberts?  I have this show.  Two big burgers. 
[00:36:00]  French fries.  That's a paranormal movie.  That's horrible.  Nah, that looks scary, dude.  It looks horrendous.  That looks scary.  Does it?  Yeah.  I don't think that's real.  The audience lose their minds like that.  It couldn't be real.  You think they just put a camera up at a Voss show?  And they're all just, ah!  Yeah.  All right, we'll take our first break.  We got an exclusive.  The world gave us, the Opie and Anthony show, an exclusive.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  I'm not.  What's wrong with you?  It's so funny that we trumped everyone. 
[00:36:30]  I'm laughing at everybody else.  Oh, okay.  Oh, good one, Sam.  We have trumped the world.  The Opie and Anthony show have a world exclusive.  Yeah, that's right.  Look, man, that's how they get it done on every other show.  They just say it's an exclusive or a world exclusive.  No one checks into it.  Everyone believes it.  So guess what?  World exclusive today.  The only place you're going to hear the brand new Michael Jackson song is here on the Opie and Anthony show.  No one else has it yet.  That's right.  Until what, tomorrow?  It's going to be at least three days before anybody else has it.  Ah, see? 
[00:37:00]  World exclusive next with the Michael Jackson song.  Stay there.  Hey, you heard about this PennyStockChaser.com website?

We've got some Torrey fans mad at you.  Ah. 
[00:38:30]  Scar in Harrisburg.  Shut the F up, man.  New York loved Joe Torrey when he was around.  I'm not saying they didn't.  He did what no other coach will be able to do for the Yankees.  What do you think?  I don't know that.  Of course.  I'm just saying he's a miserable guy.  He just looks miserable.  He looks miserable sitting there on the dugout.  To see a little excitement from the old man.  It's kind of nice to see some excitement.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Also, quickly, watching the games, the fucking commercials drive me batshit. 
[00:39:00]  Like, I cannot stand.  If I had to see...  What, the in-game commercials?  Yes.  The same fucking commercials over and over.  There's the Viagra one with the old guy that's walking down the street talking to his reflection  about how he can't get a boner.  Yeah, that's creepy.  And the guy's telling his...  His reflection's telling him to ask his doctor.  Yeah.  And then he goes, oh, all right.  Then he comes out and high-fives his reflection.  Yeah.  And then he goes to, you know, his wife or whatever it is, knowing, you know...  And all you're thinking is, yeah, they're fucking.  Of course they are. 
[00:39:30]  She gives him that, oh, we're going to be fucking look.  He's got a big, bloody fucking boner balloon.  Oh, yeah.  Took his Viagra, he's seeing blue.  His fucking head is pounding.  His wife's cheating on him with the reflection.  Yeah.  He's talking to the reflection about his boner.  The guy in the reflection looks way cooler than the other one.  So goddamn annoying.  I mean, the one walking down the sidewalk looks like a nerd.  Watching that fucking commercial 80,000 fucking times enough already.  I'm talking about the in-game commercials. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, no, I don't care about those.  You don't care?  It's getting ridiculous.  I don't give a shit.  It's the ones that come on cable vision shit.  I understand that everyone is fast-forwarding through commercials these days.  Not as much in sporting events, obviously.  But enough.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And, I mean, you're not a hockey fan, but they've given up the ice.  The ice is all advertising this year.  I don't remember it being that many advertisements last year.  There's a huge one now.  It's center ice. 
[00:40:30]  You know what I remember when I was growing up was the fact that you go to the stadium  and there wasn't that much shit.  There was a few billboards up for, you know, Marlboro and Bud and things like that.  But now everything is covered with abs.  Every piece of space.  And they would stamp a logo on your forehead if they could as you're going into a sporting event.  And then as far as...  By the way, that's probably common.  Yeah, yeah.  You want to make ten bucks today?  Okay.  Ten bucks is the easy way.  And they just stamped the logo on your forehead, especially if you're sitting in the good seats. 
[00:41:00]  And do you remember watching a pitcher warm up?  They used to call the bullpen and the pitcher would go to the mound.  And then you would watch him, like, pitch.  And you'd sit there going, oh, come on.  Now it's like, why sacrifice those few minutes when they can go to an ad, you know, go to commercial.  Of course.  They go to commercial break.  But you used to actually sit there and watch him throw with the catcher.  What the fuck is this?  And they don't have the little bullpen buggy anymore? 
[00:41:30]  No, the little buggy.  Remember?  Yeah.  The relief pitcher was so important that he couldn't walk in from...  It's a golf cart with the big baseball hat on it.  Or something.  It would look real stupid.  Danny, can you find some of those old school?  Oh, were they awful.  Because each team tried to make it a little special.  They probably just felt it was humiliating to cart the guy out.  He's an athlete and he has to be driven to the mound.  All right, driven to the mound to throw a few pitches.  Run!  Yeah, they used all sorts of shit. 
[00:42:00]  The buggy.  Look at how stupid that thing was.  There's the Boston Red Sox.  It was a huge baseball.  And it's a golf cart looking thing.  Golf cart chassis.  And it's the Boston hat.  A hollowed out baseball.  Yeah, it's a hollowed out baseball.  And then the brim of the hat is being held up by two baseball bats.  We get it.  We know the sport.  Oh, no, but the lights are being held in the fucking gloves.  In gloves.  Everything about that is baseball.  It's a baseball thing.  Enough about baseball.  Fucking endless. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Oh, let's see.  Let's say hi to Tony in North Carolina.  Tony!  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Happy birthday, Kenny.  Thank you, sir.  What's up, Tony?  Uh, every listener to the feed on, uh, uh, little puppy dog XM, every time they went to commercial,  it was a Howard commercial.  Oh, yeah?  Listen to Howard 100-101.  Woo-hoo!  Oh, on, uh, XM.  Cool.  I was watching on television, so I didn't hear it. 
[00:43:00]  Well, I heard during the Giants game they had a lot of, uh, promotional spots for this  fine radio show, so pet the dog, pet the dog, pet the dog.  We pet the dog today.  What were we talking about?  Advertising and, uh, sporting events.  Okay.  The fucking Geico commercials, enough of that.  That stupid progressive woman, tired of seeing her.  What's the one with the eyes on the, on the, which one is that?  I hate the Geico commercials.  That's not the Geico.  That is Geico, right?  The Gecko who's working late, which is silly. 
[00:43:30]  He's got a full-size desk, and he's pushing files in there.  They would give him a little Gecko-size desk.  Of course.  And why would he be hired?  Just like that stupid Japanese noodle guy that works in accounting.  Yeah.  There's no way you would hire him.  You can't hire a Gecko.  No!  That would be a major problem with human resources.  Hate that.  The fucking, and, and, and it's walking around nude.  I mean, it's just going to be a-  Yeah, it's naked.  A distraction for everybody else.  He's calling around in the refrigerator at night.  Stepping in his own shit and walking on your Pop-Tarts. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Dirty Gecko feet.  It's stupid.  And the dumb fucking eyes on a stack of dollar bills is the dumbest, dumbest commercial ever.  Are they advertisers?  It's a dumb campaign.  And they brought back that old fucking 80s song.  Watching you.  Yeah.  I always feel like somebody's watching me.  I'm sure that band is pretty happy.  Michael Jackson singing backup on that one.  All right.  Yeah.  Which, who did that originally?  Rockwell?  Was that a Rockwell hit?  Rockwell.  Is that Michael Jackson in the background?  I did it. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  There was some kind of weird connection between that band and Jackson.  And his correctamundo on that one.  Yeah.  Huh?  It is Rockwell.  Yeah, it is Rockwell.  Rockwell's one hit is now.  Yeah.  No one has cared about this song for 20 years.  It's the money you could be saving.  Stop it.  By the way, it's a Michael Jackson song.  Because Michael Jackson is not in the background.  That is front and center.  Front and center.  No one cares about him.  What the fuck did Rockwell have on Michael Jackson?  I never knew that was him.  And no one cares about the verse on this song. 
[00:45:00]  No, they call it a Rockwell song, but that is a Michael Jackson song.  You hear him prominently.  Why don't they just grab the stack of money, rip the eyeballs off of it, and spend it?  It's right in front of you.  Right.  They'll smile at it.  Look, it's a stack of money with eyes.  All right.  And how does it get around?  Yeah.  It's just sitting there.  It's there all of a sudden.  It doesn't have little feet.  See, look.  Listen to the verse.  You don't care.  Oh, no.  It's all about the heart.  And then it comes, and it's Michael. 
[00:45:30]  I never knew that much fucking him.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to Tom in Madison.  Tom.  Good morning.  Love you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Tom.  Come on, Leno.  God, we love it.  Thank you, Tom.  Yeah, we haven't even talked about it.  Jimmy killed on Leno last Thursday.  Thank you.  It was amazing.  And you could tell Leno was really happy because, well, why don't you keep, what do you have,  buddy?  You know what gets me too, guys?  I'm not a big NASCAR fan. 
[00:46:00]  Holy shit.  The way the PDs or whoever it is that makes these cameras.  I'm a ghost.  I know I am.  Well, he's, I finally figured out that I'm a ghost.  It's hard on the phone.  No, I just know I'm a ghost.  It's all right.  The F-15's flying over.  You see, I'm a ghost.  I'm talking.  He has no fucking idea I'm even talking still.  What, Tom?  Yep.  Yep.  Anyway.  That's true.  See how annoying that is because now.  It is annoying, guys.  Neither one of us are getting a point across.  But they show the roofs.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  It was a great little phone call from you today.  I'm a fucking ghost. 
[00:46:30]  Let's say hi to AJ or AI in Miami.  Al, what's up?  What's up, brother?  Hey, man.  Hey, you ever notice the alarm company commercials?  No.  It's always a white guy.  Oh, where.  Yeah, yeah.  Where evil white guy is robbing the house.  Yeah, we've covered that, too.  Yeah, yeah.  We definitely covered that one.  Yeah, that one is definitely an insult.  That is just an insult.  Evil white guy.  Paris would have thought they even have one commercial. 
[00:47:00]  You know, have the white guy breaking in.  But, you know, have one black guy breaking in.  It's out-of-touch people trying to show diversity, but what they don't realize is that they're  being so out-of-touch that they're showing, like, they're afraid that they show a black  criminal.  That'll be an insight into how they think blacks are criminals.  It's like, instead of just saying, like, yeah, it's realistic.  Some crook's black, some white.  Fair enough.  There you go.  They go so far in the other direction because they don't live in the real world.  This is my favorite one, is the afternoon mother and daughter playing in the yard, and  then she goes, let's have some lunch, and goes inside and shuts the door and sets the 
[00:47:30]  alarm.  They live in a great neighborhood.  Yeah, me too.  It's a wonderful neighborhood.  Middle of the day.  This guy just busts the door open.  Crazy white guy.  Always.  You look like Dave Attell.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that was them trying not to be crazy white guy, but still, it's a white guy, but  you can look and go, well, he's sort of not white, in a Vin Diesel kind of way.  That's what I'm saying.  They're even overthinking that.  But I think they should just, I mean, really bring on a black guy. 
[00:48:00]  Like, so black, you know, purple?  Yeah.  Really.  Really get a black guy in there.  Come on.  That would never fly.  You know that.  Why?  And even after all their commercials only have white criminals, the first black guy kicking  in that door, they'd be, oh my God, I'm outraged.  What they should have is a white guy breaking into a black family's house.  Yeah, they haven't shown that.  Maybe you could at least turn it into a comedy.  Yeah.  And stealing back his television that they stole from him. 
[00:48:30]  Make it like a real racist parody.  Getting info on Rockwell.  Thank God we're here for you guys to give you your Rockwell info.  Steve in Connecticut.  I don't like him.  Oh, sorry.  Hey, Steve.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Steve.  Or...  Rockwell is Barry Gordy's son, which is how they got Michael Jackson to sing back up.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Oh, shit.  So that was a favor, huh?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  A little favor for his son there. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you.  I never knew that.  I'll punch it out.  All right, brother.  It's all who you know.  It's all who you know.  It's how I was able to park, like, fucking 15 feet from Yankee Stadium on Friday.  Oh, is that fantastic?  You know...  Oh, is that...  I love VIP parking.  Oh, do I adore it.  It wasn't even VIP parking.  It was like where the cops are parking.  Oh, I think I just saw...  Hello?  That said Bagley Jr.  Oh, Jim?  Just walked by the studio.  This bio for him is gigantic.  What?  He's just walking down the hall. 
[00:49:30]  What is he doing?  Look at him.  Why isn't he on his bicycle?  Why is he wearing flood pants?  He's a big, tall geek with glasses.  That was...  He was in Spinal Tap, dude.  Big, tall geek with glasses.  Was he in Spinal Tap?  Yeah, that's what they were.  Yeah, we're going to be talking to Ed Bagley Jr. in about a half hour here, so...  All right.  Was he Stumpy Peeps?  Was he Stumpy Peeps?  Or was he...  Who was he in Spinal Tap?  I forgot the drummer's name.  It was ridiculous.  Somebody will have that in seconds. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I'm sure.  You guys want to hear the new Michael Jackson song?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  The new Michael Jackson song.  Apparently, this is from the movie.  This is it.  This is it.  And this plays during the final credits.  Have you seen the trailer for the Michael Jackson movie?  No.  I could give such...  Oh, you don't go to the movie theaters for the most part.  ...a tiny piece of shit.  Dude, you know how there was all sorts of rumors he wasn't able to perform and this  and that?  He was barely fucking practicing or rehearsing or whatever. 
[00:50:30]  The trailer, he was all in.  Really?  Yeah, he's an older guy, but he was all in, dancing his ass off and explosions and...  Like, he was definitely getting ready for this big tour.  Yeah, apparently he was healthy.  Rumor has it, he wasn't even able to get to the arena to practice half the time.  They have enough footage where it looks like the guy was, you know, working hard and getting  ready for the big tour.  Yeah, he was healthy, apparently.  What do they call him?  The healthiest fucking... 
[00:51:00]  Of course.  ...kill popper ever or something?  I don't know.  He just needed sleep.  He needed sleep.  That propofol.  God bless it.  How would you sleep at night after what he's done?  That's...  They probably should have told him that, you know?  No wonder you can't sleep at night, you motherfucker.  Look at what you've done, you horrible man.  This is it.  Michael Jackson.  The movie trailer.  Oh, God.  You need the pomp and circumstance like royalty. 
[00:51:30]  Exactly.  You must be royalty.  It's a fucking bunch of rehearsal footage, who cares?  That's all this is.  It's going to make millions and millions of dollars.  Yeah.  This is a different trailer than what I saw.  Enough with this fucking dude.  I can see it online.  He hung out with children, and he's dead.  Fuck him.  That's it.  God almighty, my tired Michael Jackson.  Fucking creep.  This is just shitty camcorder rehearsal footage. 
[00:52:00]  Nothing going to put in theaters all across the world.  If you go out to see this, you're a fool.  Oh, God.  Does he look odd?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's a shot of him walking into the dressing room.  Look, he's waving again from a microphone.  That's it.  There he is, dancing in rehearsal.  With some bad handheld camera.  This stinks.  Michael Jackson, this is it.  This is it.  Yeah, well, that's it.  That's the name of the song, too.  Let's listen to a piece of it. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  One, two, three, four.  I'm not ready to be released, song.  Yeah.  Yeah, if he was alive, he wouldn't have put this out.  This is it.  Here I stand.  I'm the light of the world.  I feel grand.  This love.  I feel grand.  I can feel.  And I know yet for sure it is real. 
[00:53:00]  And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times.  And you said you really know me yourself.  This voice is really weak.  And I know that you've got to take a weight to ride.  But you say you're going to leave it for yourself.  Oh, I never heard a single word about you.  Falling in love was in my land. 
[00:53:30]  I never thought that I would be your lover.  Come up, just undestined.  This is it.  I can say.  This is horrible.  I forgot the S-H.  You get the point. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, certainly do.  I don't think it gets much better than that.  I went ouch because the thing, it said Michael Jackson's Aunt Danny has up online.  This is it.  Ticket sales break international records.  Sold out hundreds of screenings across the U.S. a month before its release.  How?  What a bunch of assholes people are.  What if I take its months in advance for a movie?  He hasn't even put out great music in a long stick.  Who fucking cares about him?  He's just a creep.  He was a weirdo.  He's just a weirdo. 
[00:54:30]  He's a fucking creep who couldn't sleep.  I'm one of those.  You can't sleep, Jimmy?  I'm terrible.  I was in Colorado, the fucking altitude fuck shop.  So I literally would wake up and I woke up at 8.15 in the morning and then was just up all day and then did shit.  It's horrible for me to sleep.  Yeah, you're like gasping.  Are you gasping for air?  Not really bad.  But you got to breathe like real deep to like feel good.  And then my nose was bad again.  It's like fucking.  How do people live up there? 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  It's very high.  It's a mile high city.  It's a good place if you have emphysema here.  Really?  Yeah.  It would probably be really rough.  I'm so stupid.  I believe you.  I'm like, really?  They send people to like Arizona for that shit.  Keep it nice and dry.  Yeah, yeah.  And lots of air.  That's what you need.  Freezing cold temperatures and no air.  Right.  A small percentage of oxygen.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Every breath you take could be your last.  Oh, God.  So, yeah, the Michael Jackson thing. 
[00:55:30]  In other pop culture news, this Miley Cyrus has got everybody in a tizzy.  I'm very upset about this.  Out of nowhere, she decided that she doesn't want to Twitter anymore.  And I was following her.  Were you really?  No.  Oh.  I guess she's.  Not on Twitter anyway.  What's the story?  She's in a movie with some dude and the guy doesn't Twitter and said you shouldn't Twitter.  So she goes, all right, I want Twitter.  And she deleted her account and the world hasn't been the same.  Everyone's going nuts. 
[00:56:00]  For some guy?  I don't even.  Yeah, I think that's.  That sounds a little manipulative.  That's the first sentence of this stuff on Google.  Why would you need to read any further than the first sentence?  Well, you want to know about Miley Cyrus.  That's somebody you would need to know everything about.  Some guy.  And her father is begging her to get back on Twitter.  It's a whole thing.  Yeah, no shit.  This is what they're discussing on TV.  Why does your father care?  Do you need something plugged?  Who gives a shit?  You know what?  She is just the golden egg laying goose for that motherfucker. 
[00:56:30]  He achy breaky hearted himself years ago.  Made a few bucks off of that.  But now her.  She is a fucking gold mine.  So why wouldn't you want everything possible to publicize her with?  Twitter.  Well, she explains the whole thing in a rap song.  No, she doesn't.  Oh, yes, she does.  No, she doesn't.  And this is a terrific rap song.  I'm sure it is.  She's good.  This is no Jay-Z type of rap song, but it's right up there. 
[00:57:00]  It's right up there with the Jay-Z stuff.  Yeah, the rumors are true.  I deleted my Twitter.  Fuck.  Can't.  That's not her.  This is her.  No, wait.  This is the world we live in.  That's not her.  That's a fucking parody of somebody.  It can't be.  That's not her.  It cannot be her.  She would not do this.  Who the fuck cares?  We have a little insight. 
[00:57:30]  Sam.  We have some insight.  Sam is our pop culture guru.  If that really is a guy's shirt, I'm embarrassed for the organization.  Oh, my God.  This is a men's medium.  It looks like a girl's shirt.  I'm not even trying to do a bid anymore.  It's embarrassing.  That doesn't look manly.  How does it not?  It's a T-shirt.  If our listeners.  What's in it doesn't look manly either.  That doesn't really matter.  The shirt looks very feminine.  Why?  I don't know.  I think it's cut.  It's a black T-shirt.  If you want a bigger one, you can not get a medium.  I don't know what we could do to make it better. 
[00:58:00]  But it just looks girly.  There's nothing girly about it.  Are we selling these things or giving them out?  Giving them out.  It might be the same as little teeny man titties.  Not giant, but little.  Little buds.  Yeah.  Like a fucking 13-year-old.  You're getting your boobies.  Yes.  I'm starting.  You look like you're beginning to develop nicely.  I'm blossoming.  Exactly.  Coming into your own.  Buds.  Buds.  What do we got on this Miley Cyrus?  So she decided out of nowhere to get rid of Twitter, huh?  Yeah.  Well, like you were saying, a guy told her to. 
[00:58:30]  She clears that up in the rap song.  It wasn't some person telling her.  Oh, really?  To take it down.  And I mean, if you guys don't believe that this is really her rapping, maybe you should  watch the YouTube video.  There is a YouTube video?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, maybe we got to see that.  Oh, I've got to look at this.  Yeah.  Yeah, the rumors are true.  I deleted my Twitter, huh? 
[00:59:00]  Can you believe it?  I got two, two million, then I said adios.  I had to say goodbye.  And this little rap is to tell my fans why.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  No, it wasn't because my friend told me to.  Y'all know very well what you say I don't do.  And the reasons are simple.  I started tweeting about pimples.  I stopped living for moments and started living for people. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, you write what you're doing, but who really cares if I'm playing with Noah or just  doing my hair?  Everything that I type and everything that I do, all those lame gossip sites take it and  they make it news.  I want my private, I want my private, I'm done trying to please.  I ain't living for tablets, no, I'm living for me.  No more emo quotes and thank you with Jimmy. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I'm done with all that and the truth is I'm too busy.  Yeah, I gotta admit, I'm the same cook's tweets.  And I really like looking at Katy Perry and Britney.  I might have some withdrawals.  I was a little upset, but I'm peacing out and I'm leaving with this.  Ha, goodbye.  Ha, ha, goodbye.  Did she Twitter that she left Twitter? 
[01:00:30]  No.  Oh.  I wonder if she wanted money from Twitter and they wouldn't give it to her.  I wonder if there's something like that.  I'm just looking at the other girls that are in her video and, uh, wow.  They're pretty fucking hot with their little fucking tiny heinies.  Yeah.  But she's still looking for attention by doing this.  I know, by doing that.  Why don't you just go away then?  She's answering the question.  This is the same exact thing.  How many views does that fucking thing have?  Yeah, exactly.  I think it was up to...  By the by.  1.9 million.  So, so she's still... 
[01:01:00]  Oh, we're at 2.3 already.  She's still seeking attention.  I mean, the thing would be to delete your Twitter account, don't give an explanation,  and never acknowledge it.  Yeah.  Or just put a statement on your fucking website that goes, I didn't want to be involved with  Twitter anymore.  I want my private life private.  End.  Right.  She's doing the same thing, just in a different way.  But she did a rap.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Or she'll come back now and have more Twitter followers once they convince her to come back.  Oh, I can't wait.  God, the world won't be the same until she comes back. 
[01:01:30]  It won't.  She deleted her Twitter.  She didn't delete her YouTube channel.  Ah.  I mean...  That's different.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  She was wondering about things that she didn't really think were important.  Yeah, and then everybody was blowing it up out of proportion, and she's like, hey, I was  just doing this for fun.  It's not getting...  It's not fun anymore.  Yeah, it's not fun.  That means she couldn't, like, think of intelligent tweets.  Oh, so she got out of there?  Yes.  Yes.  Are there any intelligent tweets, by the way?  Well...  Let's be real here.  Are there really any? 
[01:02:00]  But what is she saying, though?  I submit.  But the one she was talking about was completely lame.  Did she have pimple?  Doing her hair?  Yeah, the pimple.  Did she have a pimple?  I'd like to hear about that.  Where is it?  Yeah, really.  It's gone.  Her vag lip.  I got open source.  I think they are pimple.  The doctor gave me a vowel trick.  Yes, he does.  All right.  It's silly doctor.  This is more of a...  I think this is more of a visual, but it's worth a peek.  I actually tweeted this over the weekend. 
[01:02:30]  If you go to OP Radio on Twitter, the Meredith Vieira video is unbelievable.  Was this actually on TV?  Yes.  It's on the game show.  Man, you saw it.  Yeah, yeah.  She does Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the what?  The daytime edition?  Millionaire!  Millionaire!  And some, what, naval guy?  What was he?  A naval aviator.  A naval aviator was on the program, and she fucking lost her mind.  She was all horned up.  Yeah, it was this all-American kind of guy, you know, he's in his uniform and shit, or 
[01:03:00]  he's got the haircut and everything.  Yeah.  Just looked like a real, like from casting.  Like a man's man.  Yes.  And Meredith Vieira loses her mind.  She was really...  She was getting fucking damp.  Oh, yeah, she was.  You could see it in her face.  She was like, she was giddy.  Is he handsome?  I think this video is a dream.  He's a dreamboat.  My God.  I think this video is going to do very, very well. 
[01:03:30]  It's dreamy.  Here's the audio.  Max Schoen.  Check out the video for the show.  Okay, Max, you are one handsome guy.  Whoa.  I don't normally like to fly, but I am changing my mind.  Listen, we don't have much time, so we want to play, okay?  I'm ready.  I'm ready to play any time, too, Max.  You hear her little, like, sexy cougar voice?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Does she have a husband or no?  I thought she did.  Oh, my goodness.  On The View, she used to talk about her kids and her husband and everything like that. 
[01:04:00]  I think her husband's broken.  What?  I think she's got a broken husband.  Busted?  He's like...  Is he looking in the fucking reflection as he's walking to the doctor's office asking  about fucking Viagra?  Yeah, he's like...  Meredith Viagra.  Oh, what do you mean, broken?  He's just broken.  Really?  Like, he's got...  Yeah, that's what I hear.  She's married.  I think he's got a few medical issues.  What?  Are you serious?  Unless I'm thinking of another older...  I have no idea.  Broad.  Meredith, hold on.  We ignored something, by the way. 
[01:04:30]  Meredith Viagra.  We ignored that instead of...  Instead of Viera?  Hoping that would slip by.  Ew.  Yes.  Stupid bird.  Yeah.  It's very nasally.  The worst bird ever.  Great to have you back, Jim.  Viera's husband has multiple sclerosis.  Oh, no.  I can't even hold... 
[01:05:00]  And two bouts of colon cancer.  Ow!  Yeah, the guy's a bit broken.  What a dud he sounds like.  Do you blame her now for being a little horned up?  It's got to be bad enough to have one sclerosis.  Yeah.  And two bouts of colon...  He's just laying on his side watching TV.  Oh, shit.  She's hitting on some young guy she wants to fuck.  That's nice.  Oh, how horrible is that?  Terrible.  He's just sitting there drooling on the couch, and she's fawning over this fucking Navy dude.  He's dabbing his hiney with a wet nap, and she's trying to fuck Richard Gere from an officer and a gentleman. 
[01:05:30]  Fucking whore.  Really?  Mayonnaise.  Show some respect.  You know this is going to get back to her husband.  Oh, God.  And he can't do anything about it.  Your husband's fucking itching his asshole with a feather, and you're fucking trying to bang this guy on national television.  You're cuckolding him.  Oh, shit.  Rotten woman.  Tells her to just sit on the bedpost again.  What is this guy going to be able to do?  He can't compete with this.  No, he can't at all.  Poor guy.  Two bouts of colon cancer. 
[01:06:00]  He's probably tired.  Supposed to lay in the house and be left alone with his sclerosis.  Would you, uh...  He's a fighter pilot, this guy.  Would you bang Meredith via...  No.  No.  I'd let her suck my neck.  You wouldn't bang her?  No.  Why?  Fucking, she's old.  I don't want that.  She's not attracted to her.  See how fucking warmed up she is?  It doesn't matter.  She's a cougar.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  I'd let her blow me.  I'm not attracted to her.  I would.  An older woman I'd fuck if I was attracted to her.  All the kids that have split out that meat flu.  I think you're going to be attracted to her.  Because she's really fucking visually horned up. 
[01:06:30]  She is completely horned up.  And your fucking mind goes into some nice places.  Poor husband's laying at home on his stomach, cutting very airy, tender farts.  Just watching his wife flirt with a guy who's more of a man than he is.  Oh, God.  Doesn't even know what Viagra is yet, this guy.  No, he doesn't.  He has no fucking clod.  Rock hard dicks.  Yeah.  This guy gets hard from flying.  That's it.  Okay, Max, you are one handsome guy. 
[01:07:00]  Whoa.  I don't normally like to fly, but I am changing my mind.  Listen, we don't have much time, so we want to play, okay?  I'm ready.  I'm ready to play any time, too, Max, all right?  You know the rules.  You can come fly.  Okay, you don't get them like this that often, all right?  You know the lifelines.  Are you ready?  I am.  Hey.  Let's play millionaire.  I have even more respect for the military.  For $100, in golf, scoring one stroke, you heard me right, scoring one stroke under car 
[01:07:30]  on a hole is called a what?  Doggy, ducky, birdie, miracle.  Scoring one stroke under car on a hole is called a what?  Yeah, my father is an avid golfer.  If I got this wrong, he would kill me.  It's birdie.  Final answer.  I hear the little birdie.  You're right.  You got it.  For me, it's a miracle.  Okay, you are a miracle, Max.  Going for $200. 
[01:08:00]  Get it.  Dry your fucking vag off for a second.  That's just a warm-up.  The second clip we got here, she just fucking loses it.  She's kind of sexy there, though.  When the equipment shorts out because of her vag juices getting into the computer.  I saw her, Jimmy, in the steak place that you go to as well, in the Time Warner building.  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't look anything like that.  It's amazing what they do with this TV makeup.  Oh, yeah?  It's amazing.  Her vag is drooling like your face after you sneeze without a hanky. 
[01:08:30]  Like her husband on the couch.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's terrible.  The poor husband.  Oh, that's awful.  Poor guy.  And here we go, the second clip.  I know.  It's pathetic.  I'm an old, horny woman, all right?  All right.  Give me a break.  All right.  For 200, the childhood prank known as a wet willy involves putting a wet finger in someone's 
[01:09:00]  what?  She is just...  Anywhere you want to put it, Max.  All right.  Ear.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  This is a game.  We're going for $200.  Okay.  The wet willy.  You put it where?  The ear.  She is just losing her fucking mind.  That's all I got.  Ear, armpit.  Yeah.  Well, then he puts his wet finger in her ear.  He gives her a wet willy and puts his damp, moistened saliva finger in her ear. 
[01:09:30]  Does he?  It involves putting a wet finger in someone's what?  Unfortunately, I never quite grew up.  Would it suffice if I just gave you one?  Would that suffice it?  She can't get off her chair quick enough to get over to him.  That'd be the asshole now.  And he shoves his fucking slacks into a crack.  It was good for me.  You got it.  She is... 
[01:10:00]  No, no.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Now, John, we're out of time for today, but we'll be back tomorrow.  You got to count on it.  I'll be here, and so will him.  She must have just rubbed herself.  So will him?  Bye-bye.  Yeah.  She must have rubbed herself raw thinking about this guy.  She is horned up.  There's a white uniform.  Poor fucking Meredith.  Poor husband.  The husband's just at home.  The husband's at home.  She can't do anything. 
[01:10:30]  She's there with her fucking pussy all wet for the first time in years.  He's spending his entire day looking up cures for MS, and she's fucking rubbing him out.  She's a military man.  Just hoping there's a cure.  Can you imagine that guy hitting on your chick?  What do you do?  Yeah.  Nothing.  You leave.  You leave.  Just leave the room.  Just leave her.  I was in, before I forget, last night, speaking of people who aren't doing too well.  I went out to dinner last night, and we saw a, there was a deformed guy at the restaurant, 
[01:11:00]  and he had the type of giant tongue that sticks out.  Like, it was like something you'd see on the Discovery Channel.  It was the size of a small filet mignon.  Did it taste as good?  It must have been dry.  And he was sitting there.  He kept checking his watch like he was waiting for someone to show up.  And they finally sat him alone, and he was like three or four seats away from us. 
[01:11:30]  And they sat three different couples next to him, and every one of them got up and moved.  Wow.  It was really, when he was sitting there, literally, it was probably hanging out of his  mouth six inches, and I make, it looked like, again, a small filet mignon, but red.  It was a giant tongue that I watched him eat.  Like, he would drop something on top of it and suck it into his mouth like a frog.  It's gotta be, you gotta be able to take care of that.  There's gotta be a way to fix it.  That'd be a tongue surgery.  But they sat people next to him, and every one of them asked to move. 
[01:12:00]  It was really, I felt really bad for him.  It's like, I know that it's like you want to enjoy your meal, but it's like, show some  humanity, this poor fuck.  But you gotta look at him while you're fucking eating?  It's one meal.  He lives an awful life.  It ruins your fucking dinner.  Why should my dinner be ruined, having to look at fucking old giant tongue?  I would sit there if the restaurant gave me half off or something.  Dude, it was so fucking bad.  I felt so bad for this guy.  People are usually socially not that rude.  Did you sit next to him?  No! 
[01:12:30]  But I didn't even notice him.  I didn't even know that there was a deformed guy there until I got this text as I was arriving  in the restaurant.  The enchantress that I'm dating sends me this text.  This is a deformed guy.  I hope he's here for an online date so I can see her reaction.  And that's why you guys are perfect for each other.  I really laughed when I read that.  That's great. 
[01:13:00]  But I felt so fucking bad for the guy.  Like, people just were asking to move.  Shunned.  And there was a woman who was sitting next to him, like, sitting there before he sat.  And I went to the bathroom.  When I came back, she was sitting, like, he was right next to her at another table.  And she had her, like, left her right hand up, blocking her eyes.  Like, she was leaning and talking to her boyfriend.  But she had her hand positioned where it worked as an eye blocker, too.  It was, like, so obvious.  Did the tongue smell, too?  I'm sure it did.  It had to have.  Why didn't they have him face on a wall somewhere? 
[01:13:30]  He probably needed to look at his date, who was, you know.  Oh, wow.  Who never showed up.  No.  I wanted to walk over and go, look, dude, stop checking your phone.  Stop it.  Something's come up.  Did you put a burlap sack with one hole in it over his head?  Walk around like that.  How will I know it's you?  You'll know.  Just follow the looks of horror.  How bad do you need to talk at that point?  Wouldn't you just have it removed?  I don't know why.  Or cut down to something manageable?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand.  It was sticking out literally like a blown-up red balloon. 
[01:14:00]  How far out?  Wow.  Again, it came down to past, like, around his chin or farther.  It was just hanging out of his mouth.  It was thick and fat.  It looked like a liver.  It looked like a liver.  Maybe he got stung.  Oh, shit.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Not that long.  But it was worse looking than that because that dog's tongue is at least healthy looking.  Well, here we go.  We got some explanations coming in.  Perry, what's up? 
[01:14:30]  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Perry.  Hey, buddy.  So, basically, that's from antidepressants.  It's not like a deformity.  It's from, I guess they take some kind of antidepressant and their tongue sticks out.  Well, wouldn't that make you depressed to have a big tongue and be shunned?  This was not antidepressants.  God, when you saw this tongue, this was not like a medication reaction.  Um, this was a deformity.  This was somebody, like, this was somebody who was deformed.  Like the Rolling Stones logo?  That's exactly what it was like.  But the tongue was fat and bullfrogish, toad-like.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  But it's from antidepressants?  Was he walking weird?  No.  Oh, weird.  That is weird.  It was huge.  Fucking touch yourselves.  All right.  All right.  Uh, let me say hi to Jerry in Philly.  Jerry!  Jerry!  Morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, man.  On Anthony's Twitter, he snapped a picture of a retarded guy wearing a Derek Jeter uniform.  The Yankees game.  Derek Jeter.  We were having a little fun with that. 
[01:15:30]  I felt a little bad.  And then I videotaped him during the seventh inning stretch where they do the YMCA.  And he's doing YMCA.  He was enjoying that?  Yeah, look.  See?  He's having such a good time.  He's just having fun.  He's just trying to...  He's going like, whoa, why?  But he didn't know when it was, like, over.  Like, other people sit down and he's still standing up, kind of just...  He was the time of his life. 
[01:16:00]  To be a fucking...  To have Down syndrome's got to be amazing.  Everything's fun.  What do you mean it's got to be?  Look at him.  Everyone's sitting down.  He's still standing.  Having a great time.  Nothing is bad.  Nothing sucks.  What problems?  You think he's paying bills?  Oh.  Just going to the Yankee game.  Dancing to the YMCA. 
[01:16:30]  And then he tried to do the YMCA thing.  And it kind of came out like T-L-L-V-Q.  He's dancing.  Fantastic.  But he was high-fiving everybody around him when the Yankees did something.  And I, like, turned away every time.  Because he was also...  For some reason, Down syndrome kids, they just love rubbing their nose all the time.  Yeah, it itches.  Yeah, it itches.  It's just their nose seems to always itch and run. 
[01:17:00]  And there's a lot of saliva that gets wiped on the hand.  And then he's high-fiving people.  And I'm like...  And then he's high-fiving people.  And then those people want to high-five me.  And then I didn't want to proxy saliva.  He doesn't even look retarded.  He was corky-ish.  Yeah, he looks fine.  He was very, you know, highly functional.  He was carrying on conversations.  He knew all the players' names.  He's yelling at the fucking ump.  You know, he was fine.  That's why I didn't feel that guilty.  Because, you know, it wasn't like he was sitting there profoundly retarded. 
[01:17:30]  What happened to the tongue guy last night?  He ate by himself.  And then he wound up just leaving.  But it was really sad.  Did he seem happy?  No.  I mean...  Did he seem happy?  Dude, people are...  Some people just don't understand what they got.  And they just...  They're happy.  It was such a deformity that people were almost comfortable looking...  It's like...  Can we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  I need to know what this is.  You lose a certain amount of...  People forget the fact...  Did the rest of them look normal?  Or did he have other growths?  No, the rest of them looked normal. 
[01:18:00]  The rest of him looked normal.  Except for that.  But it was an absolute deformity.  It's not a medical...  It couldn't be.  I couldn't take a picture of it.  I've never heard of that one before.  Just a giant, giant tongue.  His lower lip looked really huge, but you couldn't see it.  Because it probably had been supporting the giant tongue his whole life.  Maybe.  How old did the gentleman do you...  What did you say he was?  I mean, maybe 30, 35.  You couldn't really see.  Why wouldn't they take care of that at like three years old?  I don't know.  And just cut his fucking tongue out.  People forget that you're sitting there with a person. 
[01:18:30]  It's like almost like...  Was it unpleasant?  Like, yeah, I wouldn't want to look at that while I ate.  But me having an unpleasant meal is not as important as fucking further humiliating this guy.  Like, that was just ugly.  People were just fucking...  Outwardly fucking rude.  And meanwhile, this is what I was telling my girlfriend why it was annoying me.  If one of them had like a son or something like that who was, say, injured in the war...  Your son.  And had both his arms or something shot over his face injured by an IED.  Yeah.  And people were staring.  They'd go, what the fuck are you looking at?  But they felt comfortable showing no fucking humanity to this guy. 
[01:19:00]  It really annoyed me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I felt...  I pelted him with rotten fruit.  Sure.  It was a bad decision.  But you know what I mean?  People were fucking just rude.  I don't know what the right thing to do there.  You gotta just tough it out and fucking...  But you gotta stare.  Push your screaming girlfriend's face to his.  Make her kiss her.  Make her kiss her.  No, I didn't stare.  I would stare, but I wouldn't move my seat.  I didn't stare.  I'd be uncomfortable moving my seat.  I'd be uncomfortable.  I wouldn't be happy about it.  But I'd be...  No, you'd just eat.  It's like...  There was a gentleman on a flight I was on once that... 
[01:19:30]  He was sitting in first class, of course, because that's where I was.  And he would do this thing where he...  He'd stretch his face out like you would if you're scratching or your upper lip or something.  And jam his fingers in his nose and dig and pick and then shove it in his mouth and just keep doing it.  Dude, the whole flight.  And he did this thing where he put his tongue out as he was doing it, as he's picking, and then would wipe it on his tongue and then stick his tongue in his mouth. 
[01:20:00]  And did it the...  There was not a second going by where he wasn't doing this.  Was he retarded or was he OCD?  I don't know.  OCD, probably.  There was something going on that was not normal.  And I was livid that I kept catching him out of my peripheral.  Or, you know, the flight attendant would come by with the food or something.  And I'd look and then glance over and go, fuck, I looked at him again.  Who was he sitting with?  Some poor son of a bitch that had to sit next to him. 
[01:20:30]  Jesus.  He didn't fly.  He was flying alone.  Of course he was.  Oh, of course.  But just disgusting.  Like, his tongue would go out to the side like...  And he'd put this big long face...  Pick and then wipe it on his tongue.  That's...  Yeah, that's a fucking...  Oh, my God.  Horrid.  Let's get Dr. Steve in the conversation.  Dr. Steve, we got a situation.  Jimmy, explain.  I don't know if you were listening today, Dr. Steve.  The guy's tongue was just sticking out of his mouth.  And it was...  It looked like a small roast, almost. 
[01:21:00]  It was like a frog tongue.  It was obviously like a bumpy, weird texture.  It was giant, Steve.  It was just sticking out.  Wow.  Was he like a Down syndrome person?  You know what?  He might...  It's funny you say that.  He might have been...  Funny.  I couldn't really say because...  He looked Asian, but his face was hard to really distinguish.  You couldn't really tell.  He might have been.  Yeah.  Well, large tongue is called macroglossia.  I mean, we have a different word for everything. 
[01:21:30]  And Down syndrome is one of those things that can cause it.  Some thyroid disorders can cause it.  There's also tumors of the tongue that can make you have a large tongue.  I have heard of a guy that was examining someone with the two tongues in your mouth.  And the guy had one tongue laying on top of the other one.  And the guy said, what are you talking about?  And he said, you've got two tongues.  And he's like, I do not.  He said, look in the mirror. 
[01:22:00]  And so the guy looked in the mirror and he went, well, what do you know?  I do have two tongues.  And it turned out that the second tongue was actually a T-cell lymphoma.  And so that's, you know, so an infiltrative lesion of the tongue could cause a really large...  Anthony's looking at a picture of a kid who has his tongue sticking way out.  It was worse than that.  Much worse.  No fucking way.  Much worse.  That is horrible.  It was really fat and thick, too.  It was fat, thick, hanging out of his mouth there, Steve.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, it could be any of those things.  Look up a macro-macroglossia. 
[01:22:30]  Why can't you just take the tongue out?  Well, you can.  That's got to hurt.  But the stump that's left is not going to be very functional.  Sometimes you'd have to remove the whole tongue.  Well, Steve, I understand it's not going to be functional.  But, I mean, what is your choice there?  To walk around with this huge tongue hanging out of your mouth or looking somewhat normal  and then dealing with the problems that causes not having a tongue?  Can't they shave it down and just make it where it stays in your mouth?  Shave it down.  Well, dude, yeah, you'd have to ask, like, an oral surgeon wouldn't do that. 
[01:23:00]  I guess it would be an ear, nose, and throat surgeon would do something like that.  That's such an unusual thing.  I just haven't come across it.  I could do some research for you.  But I know that in the cases where it's an infiltrated lesion, you know,  where something's infiltrated the tongue and made it huge so it's protuberant,  they will remove the whole tongue.  Wow.  They can't just remove the tumor and shrink it down?  Well, because it's, look, the tongue doesn't just come out to, you know, in the mouth. 
[01:23:30]  It goes actually way far back into the back of the throat.  And so you end up doing this major surgery where you're removing a muscle that's attached to the way far back of the throat.  Yeah, it's pretty awful.  Hold on.  We've got a few people on the line here.  Saul in Ohio.  Saul.  You're on with Dr. Steve.  Yeah, I think that this thing may be what's called a hemangioma,  which is a tumor that's made of blood vessels, 
[01:24:00]  and you can't cut it out because they bleed too much.  And so it's a common tumor in the head and neck,  and it could infiltrate the tongue and the lip and the face.  Oh, a tumor in my ass neck.  Let me see a damn picture.  I'll show you a picture.  Is that possible, Steve?  Oh, yeah.  Hemangioma can infiltrate any part of the body.  Maybe he just has a really bad STD.  It could be a really big, puffy-looking thing. 
[01:24:30]  I can't look at these pictures.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Danny's popping up some awful fucking photos.  Jimmy, what color was it?  Red.  It was bright red?  Reddish color, yeah.  Chris, what's up?  You're on with Dr. Steve.  Hi, guys.  Yeah, my sister was, my older sister was a recreation director in a nursing home,  and I was a little girl, and I would help her with the monthly birthday parties.  And there was a lady at this place with a tongue exactly like that, 
[01:25:00]  and she just kept, I was passing out cheese,  and she just kept taking all the cheese.  And my sister said, don't give her any more.  She doesn't need any more.  And this lady with this tongue grabbed my arm, and it's like, how does she know what I want?  And it was just terrible because she was nasty, so I think she had dementia,  and probably, like, she had no backbone.  She was all trumpled over, and she had a tongue like that.  That's why I don't volunteer in old-age homes. 
[01:25:30]  I used to as a kid.  Oh, that's why?  I used to as a kid when you were doing some of that.  No, I used to as a kid when I was doing some religious shit, and they're just nasty people.  You get no return on your good charity.  They're just nasty in old-age homes.  I'll never forget that.  With fucking this bizarre strength.  Hey, I just sent Danny.  Is Danny working today?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's here. 
[01:26:00]  I knew that was coming.  Of course.  I sent him a picture of hemangioma, the tongue.  He maybe could put it up and then see if that's what Jim was looking at.  Yeah, right on.  That's so disgusting.  I can't look at these fucking pictures.  That rocks.  The bottom one's closer.  All right, Dr. Steve.  I'm going to piss.  All right, boys.  Yeah, we got to.  November 7th, live.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, we got to start promoting the big Dr. Steve New York City visit.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Once a year, right?  Yep.  All right, Steve.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, boys.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day.  Dr. Steve, everyone. 
[01:26:30]  Dr. Steve.  We have Ed Begley Jr.  Is he doing other interviews or other press?  I saw him walking around before.  Is he ready to go after the break, Steve?  Okay.  Was he doing other press?  He is doing some after us, but he's just chilling.  Oh, I didn't know he was waiting.  All right.  He's just chilling.  He's cool?  Yeah, he's cool.  Okay.  All right.  Actually, I'm breaking in a minute.  I didn't realize you were waiting.  Yeah, we got the backstage with ONA staff fight, but we'll play this a little later  on in the show because we've got to get back quick to talk to Ed Begley Jr., Opie  and Anthony.  Watch them run.  Pretty.  Watch them fall.  Oh, they did that pretty.  Watch them try to catch a ball. 
[01:27:00]  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics.  You're just in pity.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell. 
[01:27:30]  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball got to be about the funniest freaking thing  I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Take it quirky.  At the Special Olympics. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, you're so sick, pretty.  You can sing at my wedding when I get nothing.  Liquid paper.  What do I know?  Opie and Anthony, Ed Begley Jr. in the studio.  We're just talking about Kindles.  He just got one for his birthday.  I got one for my birthday.  I just set it up over the weekend.  And my birthday was six months ago.  You see?  That's the type of guy I am.  I'm a nice guy.  You're a very good guy. 
[01:28:30]  But I'm finally in the Kindle world.  How do you like it?  So far, so good.  It's amazing.  You don't have to start reading again, I decided.  And you don't have to, with me, with my long arms, moving that paper around, folding the  different pages.  I'm bumping people on the subway.  This.  I got it right here.  I'm going page to page with the flick of a finger.  I forgot how many newspapers around the world.  And you could just subscribe to the newspapers.  And like Ed Begley Jr. is saying, that stupid New York Times opens up to what?  Six feet across.  All the trees.  No more of those trees either.  There we go.  There we go.  The opening shot. 
[01:29:00]  I didn't even think about that.  But yeah, you're conserving.  And we definitely.  We definitely have an issue in studio right now.  You're looking at the polar opposite of you right there.  Anthony Comey.  But that's the beautiful thing.  The universe is in balance.  There's a yin and the yang.  We kind of balance each other out.  Because we're reading that your electric bill was $30.  Or you spent about $30 a month.  $30 a month is about what I spent.  $30 a month?  Yeah.  Was your electric bill?  Wow.  You want to tell Ed Begley Jr. what your last electric bill was?  All right.  Now this is real.  This isn't normal.  Because during the summer. 
[01:29:30]  And we did have kind of a cool beginning to the summer.  Don't downplay it.  And I kind of like a warm pool.  I do have a pool heater.  So I have two of them actually.  One is propane and one is electric.  How warm you need your pool.  I love my pool being 93 degrees.  Oh boy.  That's a warm pool.  That's kind of a spa more than a pool.  Yeah.  It's kind of nice to just jump in.  Well the spa is about 104.  Okay.  So when you jump in the pool from the spa. 
[01:30:00]  It seems cool.  I hear you.  But you're never really cold.  You're never cold.  Yeah.  And that's running.  And then I have a studio in my basement also.  With a lot of lighting.  That I do a webcast from.  And the lights really.  Ooh.  That got the meter spinning.  The bill.  $3,000.  Hello.  Was my electric bill for last month.  That's true too.  That's a big bill.  Tripped over the $3,000 mark.  $3,000 for electric.  $2,700.  But normally it's not even $1,000. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You had a big one.  Yeah.  But over the summer.  A lot of lights on.  A lot of parties at the house.  A lot of lighting in the yard and everything.  And why do you bother?  Why do you bother?  I've got to balance them out.  Why do you bother if you've got guys like Anthony in this world?  I feel like I'm negating what you're doing.  The noble effort of you.  No, no.  You're negating 5,000 Ed Begley's.  Do you feel like you're getting anything done when you hear stories like Anthony Comey?  I do. 
[01:31:00]  Because I do it.  People think it's all about the environment.  I do care about the environment.  But basically, the bike riding, the bus, all of that stuff, it's basically because I'm cheap.  Okay?  Are you a chiseler?  I'm the cheap, cheap bastard.  Yeah.  I hate to spend money.  To the point you don't want to buy a car?  Well, you do have a car.  I have an electric car.  You've got a hybrid car.  I drive that about 300 days a year.  I drive my electric.  I take the bus.  I ride a bike.  You do realize you're Ed Begley Jr.  You should not be taking buses.  I understand the bike.  I understand the electric car.  I was on the bus all over the place.  He's got his metro car.  I got my metro car. 
[01:31:30]  But you don't need to be doing the bus thing yet.  I like it.  Nobody bothers me.  What are they going to bother me?  It's not like it's Brad Pitt.  It's Ed Begley.  Who's going to bother me?  What are we talking about here?  Spinal tap.  You were a spinal tap.  I'm not big enough to have any stalkers.  How many blue cops?  How many blue cops?  This is a low job.  A stalker for Ed Begley.  That's really low.  What were you saying?  Because I would think Ed is best known for his role in Blue Collar with Richard Pryor.  Oh, my God.  You're really paying for big Pryor fan.  Big Richard Pryor fans in the studio. 
[01:32:00]  Pryor fan.  He's the biggest right there.  Just a quick question.  Completely off the subject.  I heard the director said he was the unhappiest guy he ever worked with.  Oh, no.  That was a guy from Boston Lewis.  Was he miserable to work with or to be on the set with?  Richard was very nice on the set.  And Paul Schrader directed that.  He was nice to me on the set.  And Paul Schrader seemed to get along with him.  But he certainly had his demons, as we later learned.  He got in a freebase and stuff.  But he really behaved on that show.  If he was doing drugs, nobody saw it on that show.  Didn't him and Kytel and Koto hate each other?  I read that they were like fist fighting. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, there was some animosity on that.  There was somebody that was fighting.  I don't know if it was Harvey and Yoffa.  It's somebody.  There was some unhappiness on the set.  But I never experienced any of it firsthand.  I heard that some people were pissed off.  But I got along with everybody.  But it was the 70s.  I was drunk the whole show.  I was loaded.  So maybe that's why we think we're kind of roasted.  I like the honesty here from Ed.  You become kind of like the picture of what people think are environmentally friendly actors. 
[01:33:00]  For years ago, they would say, hey, Begley on his bike.  And then it just kind of caught on.  And you became kind of the face that people put to it.  Are there things that you want to do?  And all of a sudden, you're like, I can't because everybody associates me with this now.  Yeah.  I had to turn down that Hummer commercial.  You know?  It was lucrative.  It was a great deal.  Especially when you found out it wasn't for the car.  Hey, I hear you, Bob.  Awesome.  Hey, you know, and this happened many times over the years.  I'd be asked to do a show that was overseas. 
[01:33:30]  And back for a while there, I wouldn't fly at all.  Now I fly if I have to.  I take, you know, my electric car, my Weiss hybrid.  I take Amtrak.  But I wouldn't fly at all.  And so I missed a lot of jobs because of that.  But now I will fly.  If I'd like to get to, I had to get to Tampa the other day.  I was doing a monk Thursday night till late.  I had to get to Tampa Friday.  So I took a red eye, got in a plane.  Then I took Amtrak after that.  You know, I just do the best I can.  Whatever situation I'm in, I take the best, the most low-impact transportation.  I just picture you looking out the window during the flight, just weeping, looking at the exhaust coming out the engine. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, why?  Why?  Where did this begin?  It started in 1970 with the first Earth Day.  I just got fed up living in smoggy L.A.  I'd lived through 20 years of that horrible smog.  And it was really bad back then.  As a young kid, your lungs hurt all the day.  New York was just as bad.  Yeah, it was bad.  So I decided I'd buy an electric car.  I bought an electric car for $950.  In 1970?  1970.  A Taylor Dunn.  They still make electric cars.  How far could you go?  Well, when I say car, I'm being quite grand.  But talk about a golf cart with a wind shear wiper and a horn. 
[01:34:30]  You know, it really went about 15 miles an hour or something, had a range of about 15 miles.  But I drove it around L.A.  And I learned right away, and back to my point a moment ago, it was cheap.  It was cheap to fuel it.  To plug it in the wall was cheaper than gasoline.  And to maintain it was really cheap.  There was no tune-up or oil change or fan belt or radiator flush or smog check.  Valve job was cheap.  It's not worth the embarrassment, though.  Yeah.  At that speed, you're right.  I didn't know at the time.  But I was, you know, it was uncool.  I'm on a bike, and I didn't care.  In 1970, riding a bike, you know, my bell bottoms got caught in the chain. 
[01:35:00]  The wind resistance from my Afro slowed me down.  But you're always a nerd.  Because now everyone's driving the golf carts.  Yeah.  I mean, they're selling them all over the place.  It goes 80 miles an hour.  It's not a golf cart now.  It's my electric car today, and it has been for years.  It was like the EV1 was a rocket.  That car I got in 96.  That was a very quick car.  And then 2002, I got my current electric car, Toyota RAV4, pure electric.  And that goes 80 miles an hour.  You don't even update your electric cars, Ed?  I'm cheap. 
[01:35:30]  Are you like OCD cheap?  Like some people have an OCD thing with cheapness where, like, it's almost unnecessarily.  It's almost like a victory every time.  It's like a weird compulsion to save as opposed to just kind of being smart.  I used to be that way.  You know, just I'd, you know, agonize over a dollar here, there, a quarter.  But now I just, you know, I'm doing well, so I spend money where I need to.  But I still like to save wherever I can.  And, you know, the way I did it in the 1970s is the way I recommend people do it today.  Do the cheap and easy stuff first. 
[01:36:00]  Buy the energy-efficient light bulbs, the thermostat, the weather stripping.  Do the cheap stuff first.  Just save money from that.  Then maybe you build.  Go up the ladder.  And it took me 20 years to be able to afford to buy solar electric.  20 years.  Two decades.  What are you afraid of with money?  Is it not having it?  Is it running out of it?  My dad was a conservative that liked to conserve.  He lived through the Depression, so we were told to turn off the lights and turn off the water.  He saved string and tin foil.  I was just raised in that mentality.  So, yeah, I didn't want to run out of money.  And I finally realized a while ago, hey, I'm not going to run out of money now. 
[01:36:30]  I'm fine.  You know, not because I have so much, because I don't need a lot of money.  My bills are so low.  My monthly bills for everything are nothing.  Where are you at with the environment?  You think we're ruining the environment, or is it something that's just supposed to happen?  There's some good news.  You've got to balance the good news.  There's some real challenges, you know, with deforestation, with air pollution still,  groundwater contamination.  But we have a lot of victories, too.  You've got to remember those.  The air in L.A., even though there's four times the cars since 1970, there's half the smog.  So that's a victory. 
[01:37:00]  The ozone hole, it's not bigger.  It's not the same size.  It's smaller than 87.  You know, the Cuyahoga River doesn't catch fire anymore.  The Hudson River has been cleaned up to a large extent.  What, the river would catch fire?  The Cuyahoga River caught fire in 69.  It caught fire before.  It was so polluted.  When a river catches fire.  That's not good.  It was so polluted.  It was so polluted that it caught fire.  It caught fire.  Somebody was smoking near it.  I don't know what happened, but it caught through so much pollution, the river was on fire.  Wow.  Outside Cleveland.  Yeah.  Cuyahoga River.  That's amazing.  That sounds like Cleveland. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, well, a lot of things have gotten better over the years.  And deforestation, like, obviously we do use a lot of wood products, but they are replacing the trees, whereas they used to not.  Yeah.  I mean, they used to just leave open.  And for the tree farms, that's good.  The area you've got to be careful.  You don't want to just take down your native forest, your ancient forest, and replace very old trees with new trees,  because that's, you know, that's like taking down the Smithsonian building because there's a good market for bricks and replacing it.  Well, we did that. 
[01:38:00]  I was out in Big Sur and Muir Woods and all that.  The Redwoods.  We completely destroyed the Redwoods to rebuild San Francisco.  I did not know that.  That happened centuries ago.  Yeah, I know.  A century and a half ago.  Yeah, but our ancestors said, fuck the Redwoods.  We need this wood to rebuild San Francisco.  Teddy Roosevelt.  And destroyed some ancient forests.  Yeah, a Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, decided the national parks would be a good idea.  And as Ken Burns' documentary represents, it's one of America's best ideas to preserve some of that. 
[01:38:30]  But now, you know, you don't want to take down the Louvre and put up paint by numbers.  Tree farms are different than ancient forests and their ecosystem has a certain amount of very important life to it.  I like those Redwood trees.  So it just made me sad because they are just amazing.  And what's left we should protect.  I think we're going to.  I hope so.  Where does it get ridiculous, though?  Where does it like?  Because we always hear stories about, oh, a group of activists were protesting because there was a small family of toads that live somewhere. 
[01:39:00]  And they want to stop the building of something that makes sense to build.  Right.  Where does it get ridiculous where it's like, all right, we understand the environment.  But as people, we're going to use part of the environment or we're going to damage part of it.  You know, I think there's no shortage of development.  People are developing a lot of land all over the place.  That's going on at a pretty good pace.  But the thing about the endangered species that I worry about, even if you don't care about that particular species, the spotted owl, let's say, or the kangaroo rat, you know, I mean, I look at it as another rivet in the airplane.  How many rivets can you lose from the airplane before it ceases to fly? 
[01:39:30]  For our own well-being, you don't want to lose the ecosystem.  The forests are important.  And, you know, the spotted owl is just a device to stop this logging.  It's a canary in the mine, if you will, that lets you know there's a problem.  But that owl is going, what's happening to the forest at large?  And I think that's why those points are illustrated with those specific species.  Now, you have a TV show.  Yeah, Living with Ed, starting a new season.  Living with Ed.  Season two.  This is you and how you live, how you live your life, being very cheap. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, he said cheap.  Are you a hoarder, too?  No, I'm not a hoarder.  My dear mother lived in Manhattan, was a hoarder.  I tried to get stuff out of the house.  Wow.  She lived at 49th and 8th Avenue, 3 and West 49th.  What was her thing?  What'd she collect?  She would have stuff stacked up to the ceiling.  Anything.  She'd go down, newspapers, a broom handle, a salt shaker without the pepper shaker to match, you know, a lampshade. 
[01:40:30]  She just would save everything.  She'd go to the dumpster.  It came from a good place, recycling, but it was stacked to the ceiling.  Wow.  And people think, yeah, to the ceiling.  No, I'm talking about to the ceiling, like the Collier brothers, to the ceiling.  Was it dirty or just was she clean?  It was not clean.  Okay.  I love my mother.  She passed away in 98.  I loved her dearly, but it was not clean.  Would you ever want to say, like, it's frustrating when you're dealing with something that's an illness.  Would you ever want to go just throw this shit out?  I begged her.  I tried to, you know, get her to clean it up, and she wasn't, she just wasn't capable. 
[01:41:00]  We finally got her moved to Tucson, and she had a new place there, and they had very strict rules.  So when she passed away, she didn't have that kind of clutter.  She had a bit of clutter there.  She somehow managed to get a little bit of clutter in there, but not too much.  Wow.  Yeah, I watched that show, Hoarders.  Isn't that amazing?  So often it's like, wow, you just, yeah, it's so hard to get.  Into that mindset.  And you don't see it.  It just happens slowly over time.  She didn't see what we saw coming into it, you know?  My sister and I, she didn't see that.  She saw something else, like, it was for her, a project. 
[01:41:30]  I'm going to get to that stuff, and it just, it's there for now to the ceiling, and there for now was over 40 years.  My dad was like that.  Yeah, he had a garage that, he had all this stuff that he was going to use for projects that he never got to.  He had to drive by something on the street without going like, that looks good.  He picked up everything.  Let me grab that out of somebody's garbage, and then just bring it home.  But then my mom was an OCD freak, so they were constantly battling.  She was throwing all his shit out, or I think I would have lived in a house that was, like, a house of a hoarder.  Yeah.  I constantly battle with it, because I want to save everything. 
[01:42:00]  I don't want anything to be thrown away, but I have to constantly, okay, I find a home for it, like, right away.  It's like, you know, it checks in, but it checks right out the stuff.  I take it, and I find a home for it.  That's probably some primitive shit.  That's probably, like, something that goes back to our Neanderthal days, where you're hoarding, you know, fucking berries or whatever it is we saved.  We were running around.  Oh, for the winter or whatever.  Yeah, I mean, that's probably just, like, some throwback.  Yeah, it's coming from a good place.  You don't want to waste.  Not wasting is good.  My mother's basic gene was a good one, but then she took it to a level where it's getting in the way of her life. 
[01:42:30]  You don't want it to get in the way of your life where you can't move around your apartment.  You've got the health department, the fire department knocking on your door all the time.  Then there's a huge problem.  Ed, I want to know more about living with Ed, because I'm not going to lie.  I have never seen the show, but you've piqued my interest.  So it's the day-to-day living with you and your wife, and what else do we see in general, I guess?  You know, it's really a punctuation error.  It's actually living with E period, D period, erectile dysfunction.  That's funny.  But we took a little shit.  I hear you, Ed.  And, no, it's a show about living, my wonderful wife, Rochelle, living with me, Ed Begley, and it's a walk in the park living with a guy, you know, like me, who likes to ride a bike to make toast. 
[01:43:00]  I want America to see how easy it is to live with me.  Unfortunately, a lot of people think she's right and I'm wrong.  Is she really?  Also, there's a battle going on?  There's a battle, because she, you know, she wants to go shop and do all this stuff, and I want to, you know, save energy.  I don't like to shop.  I never shop.  If I want something, I go right to the store, I say, give me that, and I walk right out.  She loves to shop, and she loves to bring stuff in the house. 
[01:43:30]  I'm always trying to get stuff out of the house.  Is she, like, maybe driving a nice car and things like that?  That was the thing.  I've tried to work with that, because she wanted to get some Infiniti or some car.  I said, it's a free country.  You can buy whatever you want.  This is before we were married.  We were dating.  I said, but if you want me to buy you a car, I'll buy you a Prius.  And so that incentive program worked very well.  She bought the Prius.  Incentive program.  And now she liked it a lot.  She loves it.  She wouldn't want another car.  But I had an incentivizer.  They almost figured out the hybrid car at this point. 
[01:44:00]  There's a lot of them out there now.  They almost figured it out.  It used to be a joke, let's be honest, at least five, six years ago.  I bought one in August of 2000, and it has 160,000 miles on it.  It still runs good.  It's been the cheapest car I've ever owned, not just to fuel, but to maintain.  Just tune up, you know, lube and oil change.  It's been really a very inexpensive car to maintain.  Let me tell you what I like driving, especially in the winter months here in New York, because I never miss a day's work. 
[01:44:30]  Because, let me tell you a little something about the Cadillac Escalade.  It plows through that snow, Ed, like nobody's business.  Yeah, you're taking a lot of seconds.  It's balanced.  Ying and Yang.  No, it's more like Ying and X and Valdez.  I really am terrible, but I love the Escalade.  Now, you live in the island, right?  Where do you live?  Yes, out on Long Island.  I'm from Merrick.  I was in Merrick yesterday.  I'm in Nassau County, yes.  Oh, great.  Nassau County.  Yeah, I'm out there. 
[01:45:00]  I was just back in Merrick yesterday.  Went to reunion at Curia Vars, a school that I attended as a young man.  I didn't know you were a Long Island guy originally.  Yeah, I was born in Hollywood, California.  Came out.  My dad was doing theater to Long Island.  Went to grade school, K through seventh grade there, and then went back to where I was born in Hollywood.  Hey, something happened on Leno that everyone wants to talk about.  John in Utah.  John.  Hey, Rush Limbaugh was on Jay Leno, and then he did the electric car challenge.  Oh, yeah.  And you were one of the cutouts, and he ran into your cutout, backed up, and ran into it again. 
[01:45:30]  I heard, because he said it felt so good.  Jay's going, it's going to take from your time.  He said, I don't care.  It feels so good.  That is funny, though.  That's not so funny.  You've got to have a laugh.  Come on.  You think it's funny?  Of course.  You can't be thin-skinned about that stuff.  A good joke is a good joke.  I was on The Simpsons driving a car powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.  That is goddamn funny.  That's good.  They had me on The Simpsons again recently with the thing I'm driving some little Ed Begley solar car. 
[01:46:00]  There's a solar eclipse, and suddenly my car goes, boo, you know, the solar eclipse comes,  and I stop right on the railroad tracks, and a train's coming.  It's good to know you have a sense of humor about the whole thing.  You have to.  Well, when you see the movies he's been in, the Christopher Guest movies, that whole, you  know, that comedic rat pack that you guys have put together.  Some of the funniest goddamn movies, man, especially.  You know what's great?  You're remembered as such a great character in Spinal Tap. 
[01:46:30]  You were in it for two seconds.  I know.  I played Stumpy Joe Peeps, the first drummer.  The first drummer.  And you just do some little moving.  And that's it.  It stands out so much.  And then Best in Show was just fantastic.  Yeah, I was a hotel manager in that.  Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, and Michael Higgins.  So you've got good people to work with.  It's going to turn out okay.  And just the basic idea was laid down, and then it was you guys just riff and...  Right.  25-page outline, and then you go from there. 
[01:47:00]  It's like you've got a chord chart, and then you play the notes the way you want to play them.  Yeah, amazing.  Really good.  I mean, some of those movies, I just watch them 20 times and still laugh my ass off.  Thank you.  Waiting for Guffman was hysterical.  Oh, I love that.  I wasn't in that one, and that's my favorite.  That's a good one.  I'm telling you, that's the first and the best.  Yeah, good one.  It really is great.  The weird thing is, like, you don't seem self-righteous about it.  I don't know if you are or not, but you don't seem, just talking to me about it, self-righteous,  like where you're...  Are you preaching to other people about the environmental stuff, or are you more like, hey, I lead by example? 
[01:47:30]  No, I've never really preached about it.  When people ask me a question or call me on a TV show or something, say, come to this event, I'll talk about it when asked.  But I've never really promoted it.  I really haven't.  I just go and do it.  I would ride my bike to the Hollywood event, then send a report and say, wait a minute, how did you get there?  What's that bike helmet?  Oh, I rode my bike here.  Well, let's talk about that.  Here, you're on the air.  But I don't really preach about it.  People ask me, and I respond, but I find it a good way to get around.  I don't need a gym, because I ride my bike to places in the world as my gym. 
[01:48:00]  You know, I like charging my car in the sun.  You know, that makes sense to me.  And I like running my house in the sun.  I bought a wind turbine in the 80s.  It works very well.  You have a wind turbine, too?  I bought a wind turbine in 85 in the California desert, part of a wind farm.  And it's been a good investment since 1985.  And it's been, you know, the bragging rights to say I've put out many homes worth of power since 1985.  I've been not carbon neutral, but carbon negative since 85.  And are you making money off of that?  Yeah, still, I just got a check for $800 the other day. 
[01:48:30]  You know, I get quarterly or annual checks, depending on how much wind blows.  And, you know, I don't have to do anything.  I just get a check.  They maintain it.  They fix it.  They do the whole thing.  And you got six Emmy nominations, I think, for St. Elsewhere.  St. Elsewhere, yeah.  Now, did you at least get a piece of the DVDs?  Because back then, they didn't know DVDs were coming out, or did you get screwed on that?  Yeah, you don't get a profit, but you get the SAG kind of minimum requirement.  But DVDs, they're not selling a lot of those DVDs.  And it was never on reruns, you know, Channel 11 or something kind of reruns.  It was on, you know, on Nick at Night or something. 
[01:49:00]  So you get like $1.80 per episode.  So you get a check for, you know, like $180 or something for a whole year.  And you don't get that every year.  You get it every few years.  Oh, so you're not living off that.  No, no, no.  That's a year's worth of driving for it.  There you go.  That's right.  You said he's not living off that, but I think he is.  I am.  He's not a cheap bastard.  Everybody thinks, oh, Eddie loves the environment.  No, I'm cheap.  $1.80 check.  Here's our vacation, honey.  Honey.  I think the headline here is Eddie doesn't give a shit about the environment. 
[01:49:30]  It's more of an OCD slash he's scared type of thing.  Yeah, throw money at him and he'll fucking drive anything.  You can't even give your wife a real white picket fence made of wood.  No, I gave her a fence made out of, I gave her a white picket fence, but it's just made out of recycled milk jugs.  It's recycled plastic.  She was all, I don't want to look at barcode and low-fat labor.  I said, honey, you're not going to see any of that.  It's a white picket fence.  You won't know until you touch it.  It's not wood.  It looks like wood.  Oh, it does.  It looks like white painted wood, but it's made out of recycled materials. 
[01:50:00]  I think I've seen those.  Why not?  Yeah, yeah, it does.  It looks like wood.  I like my fence, I think, is PVC, polyvinyl chloride.  That'll last a long time, too.  Yes, yes, and it's very good for the environment when they make PVC.  Yeah, that has its drawbacks, but I like the one I got.  Ed just groaned inside.  You think the world will figure it out, Ed?  We talk about that.  Yeah, I'm very hopeful about it because I travel around the country now. 
[01:50:30]  Now I'm on the speaker circuit.  I've heard about the third world nations that they're just burning up the environment,  the third world nations.  They are, but I think they're going to leapfrog over some of the Victorian technology that we  use to build, you know, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building, the high sulfur  coal and all that, because they're choking on their smog in Beijing and, you know, Hong Kong  and other places.  So they're getting it.  We can sell them the good technology, you know, the kind of combined cycle gas turbines,  you know, the solar panels, they're building more solar processing facilities in China than 
[01:51:00]  they are here right now.  Germany has a tremendous amount of solar.  You know, they're a developed nation, obviously, but a lot of the developing world wants to  do this stuff because they see the ill health effects that they're suffering from coal.  That's a really good point because you don't think about that, but the people have to be  noticing that they're choking to death on their own smog.  Yeah, they're missing productivity.  And there's got to be someone there going, you know what, maybe we could do this better.  Let's try this.  Oh, wait, it works.  Okay, let's do it some more.  And they're still burning a lot of coal, but they're going to build a lot of solar because  they're building a lot of solar plants to build those solar panels. 
[01:51:30]  And I think you'll see a lot of solar in China.  Can I ask something off the subject, Ed?  You said you were on the advisory committee in 2004 Racism Watch, which was founded by Ed  Asner.  And they said the group was formed to kind of respond to activities, Bush, Cheney, that they  saw as encouraging racism.  Like what kind of stuff?  Well, I'm only asking because I have a weird issue with Hollywood and race.  I find that a lot of times they're very out of touch when it comes to race relations and  the way people do things in the real world.  So like, was that what?  I don't even know anything about that.  Oh, so it's wrong. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  It's incorrect.  Well, Ed Asner probably said, hey, will you sign this thing about a thing?  It's about, at the time in 2004, I can't remember what it was about.  There was some issue that he brought to me, perhaps.  I don't remember.  Were you drunk then?  No.  All right.  I stopped that in 79.  Oh, you did.  Yeah.  I stopped in 87.  All right.  You know, little problems.  Yeah.  A few little problems.  Going to jail.  Being arrested for impersonating an officer.  That's not normal.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  I wish I had that on my list.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  When you weren't acting, you weren't. 
[01:52:30]  I was at a nightclub performing with a full LAPD uniform.  But still, if I had been sober, I don't think it would have happened.  Wait.  Oh, no.  Did you do?  What did you do?  Come on.  There's more to the story.  You were a series of bad breaks and misunderstandings.  I wound up at county jail for impersonating an officer.  You accidentally pulled a girl over?  I was walking down the street.  I wasn't actually going door to door.  And I was coming out of the Troubadour nightclub in L.A.  And I had a full LAPD uniform on.  And they said, you know, what are you doing?  You can't wear that.  No, I'm a performer.  You're not going to the set of Adam 12, taking Kent McCord and Martin Milner away. 
[01:53:00]  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  And he put me away for the weekend.  Back then, there was no ATMs.  I didn't know anybody with $500.  It was 1973, this was.  So $500 was a tremendous amount of money.  So I had to spend the weekend in jail.  Were you arrested on a Friday?  It was a Friday.  Very good.  So I got out my own recognizance on Monday.  But late in the day, it was three days in county.  Did you have to spend three days in county dressed as a cop?  No.  But then they put me in a trustee's outfit because, you know, they took my clothing away,  which was an LAPD uniform. 
[01:53:30]  Then people thought I was a trustee that had escaped.  The other people in jail, they don't like the trustees because they depend on them for contraband  and what have you.  No, I'm not.  I had a cop.  You had a cop.  You're a cop.  That's even worse.  They were like ready to fashion my head into a cigar.  I know.  All the shitty things they could give him here.  Just put on this white hood and walk around.  Was it a long weekend, Ed?  It was a very long weekend.  It was a long weekend.  Jimmy spent a couple days in the tombs here in New York.  A little bit, yeah.  A little misunderstanding.  It's awful.  It's really awful. 
[01:54:00]  Not fun.  No.  I was sober, too.  I was sober for many years when that happened.  It was just a radio stunt gone bad and we had spent 27 hours.  And I didn't shit.  That was the worst part was the prospect of shitting in front of other guys.  Yeah, that's not fun.  No, it's awful.  No.  There was no toilet land.  It was really filthy.  Was anyone taking dumps that weekend?  A couple guys did.  The guys who were used to it could care less.  Right.  They just like, whatever.  That shit in a stovepipe hat on a stage means nothing to them.  So you were doing drugs at the time, too?  Oh, yeah.  In the 70s, I did anything that I could get my hands on.  From 1971 through 78, I drank a quart of vodka nearly every day and did whatever I could 
[01:54:30]  get my mitts on.  What finally stopped you?  What finally made you go, like, what was the final, the bottom that made you go, this  is enough?  I went to Cedars-Sinai and almost died, you know?  And I had a little one-year-old daughter.  I really bottomed out in 78 and went to, you know, went to Cedars and almost died.  And then for three days in 79, I tried a few beers and some wine.  It just didn't work even with normal amounts.  I went, screw this.  I'm done.  So that was it.  Were you part of the SNL crowd that was hanging out there? 
[01:55:00]  I knew those people.  I was not a part of that.  I didn't do Saturday Night Live until 84.  I hosted it, but I knew that crowd.  I hung out with John Belushi.  He was a good friend of mine.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You do drugs at Belushi?  We did lots of things together, yes.  Did you not hit it?  John, let me tell you this.  I don't want to say anything about him, but I'll tell you about myself.  John was a sobering influence on me.  He thought I was over the top, out of control in Durango on a movie Going South.  I was so bad.  John was going, come on, put the drink down. 
[01:55:30]  Get out of the bar.  We're going to go for a drive.  She's telling you to calm down?  Calm down.  That's a problem.  John and Judy probably saved my life, saying, we'll go for a ride, take it easy.  Wow, no kidding.  Yeah.  Were you with him and Robin?  Were you here the day he died or no?  I saw him a few weeks before he died.  I was sober for a while at that point.  And I saw him a few weeks before, and I was very worried because he did not look in good  shape a few weeks before.  So you guys kind of saw, like, people who knew him kind of saw it coming, like, if he  doesn't stop, there's going to be a major problem here. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Great guy.  Very funny guy.  I don't want to forget that part of him.  He was a brilliant performer, what have you.  But he, you know, like me, in my opinion, you know, I think he had the same problem I  had.  Wow.  Great, great performer.  Very funny guy.  Great guy.  Come by my house, and we'd hang out, and, you know, he'd crash there.  It was great.  Literally.  It was his 70s.  I'm just laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's leaving on.  I'm with a few details out, which is okay.  You're young.  It's the 70s. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  It was a different era.  Why didn't he go back to his own house?  Yeah, why did he go to your place and not his own place?  Was he just like, that's as far as he could make it?  Oh, he was in L.A.  He didn't live in L.A.  He lived in New York, and so he was in L.A., came by to see me, and, you know, we'd have  a good time, and it'd get late, and he, you know, wouldn't want to drive, and so he'd  crash there.  Did you ever get high with Pryor?  I never got high with Richard.  I was getting high back then when he was straight on the show, Blue Collar, and then later 
[01:57:00]  he was certainly getting high when I was long sober.  Who were you, like, hanging out with, any of the Hollywood people that you were hanging  out with during those wild times?  I hung out with lots of people back, oh boy, back in the 70s, it was very, you know, it  was bad not to get high.  You know, if you would say somebody would offer you a joint or drugs and you didn't take it,  you'd go, hey, what's wrong with you?  Are you a narc?  What's the problem?  And then that shifted, you know, in the early 80s. 
[01:57:30]  Suddenly it became, you know, at the studio level, if you're wired, you're fired.  Before that, you'd do drugs with, you know, like studio, you know, executive level people.  You'd do drugs with them.  Wow.  And then it changed in the early 80s.  Did you know, what was his name, Don Simpson, who has a book?  He was a big guy.  I knew Don.  Yeah, I knew Don.  I had gotten sober.  Who was Don Simpson again?  Back when I met him.  He was a big producer.  Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, they made a lot of movies together.  And he certainly had some of those same demons I had.  Legendary.  He wrote a book.  What's the name of the book? 
[01:58:00]  I've heard about it, but I've never read it.  I can't remember the name of his book, but it's the title is an interesting one.  Look it up on your Kindle, Ed.  What are you doing?  I know.  How are my Kindle going?  But no, this guy would do like, they were looking for like all this weird sexual stuff  where they had some chicken.  They were putting her head in the toilet.  He wrote about it.  Like about looking for a sub.  Yeah, looking for a submissive girl you could find.  Unbelievable.  Jesus.  You know what?  I think it turned a lot of people around.  Dr. Steve's like, I love Ed Begley now.  I don't think he'd liked you before for whatever reason.  Why wouldn't Steve?  It seems very confrontational. 
[01:58:30]  Oh my God.  You should have seen his Michio Kaku text that he sent me.  Oh really?  He said, universe is like soap bubbles.  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, Steve.  That was his text.  He doesn't like Dr. Michio Kaku.  High concept.  Don Simpson and the Hollywood Cultures of Excess.  Paperback.  Could you get that on your Kindle?  Oh yeah.  I can't wait to get my Kindle.  I don't have the copy Ed has.  I have the one.  With all the traveling you do, it's perfect, Jimmy.  It's great.  I want Wi-Fi internationally.  Even though I never travel internationally, I'm a disgusting, piggish American who does 
[01:59:00]  not leave the borders.  I refuse to travel anywhere else.  But I want to get one that's international just in case.  Have you been all over the world, Ed?  I have in the past.  I haven't been to Asia.  I haven't been to much of Africa, just Tangiers.  Yeah, I haven't been to Asia at all.  Where would you live?  I don't like to travel much anymore.  I'm like him.  I like to just stay home.  I've traveled plenty.  I like to stay home.  Where would you live if you could?  Not including the United States.  Oh, my friend of mine lives in Fiji.  My friend Gavin lives in Fiji. 
[01:59:30]  That's beautiful.  The people there are wonderful.  And the snorkeling is great.  The scuba diving is great.  It's a beautiful, beautiful country with wonderful people.  Do you fly coach or first class?  I'm 6'4".  I can't fit in coach.  It just comes down to the femur.  If the femur was one inch shorter, but if somebody, you're sitting there and you really  can't move.  If they put their seat back, you're literally, you're just, whoa, whoa, dude, dude, just a  second.  Let me move.  I'll put my legs in the aisle.  Boom.  The cart hits them.  If you're 6'4".  6'2", you can maybe make it.  6'4", you can't fit.  That's lucky. 
[02:00:00]  That's lucky because now you can fly first class and go, hey, I'm tall.  Yeah.  When I have to fly at all, I got to fly first because I don't fit.  But I mostly, you know, my transportation hierarchy, number one, walking.  Number two is a bicycle.  Number three is public transportation.  Four is my electric car.  My wife's Prius is number five.  And then a distant sixth, I fly when I must.  Or a train.  A train, yeah.  I put that in with public transportation.  Yeah.  I love Amtrak.  I took Amtrak from D.C.  It's really, I think, easier than taking all your liquids out and putting them in a plastic bag 
[02:00:30]  and taking your shoes off.  I like that ride.  I like that ride from D.C.  Yeah.  You can't fly from D.C.  because you're going to want to get weather delays.  I actually have Eros lubricant, which I use to masturbate on the road, and they would  wind up throwing that out.  So they don't come a little small.  Jesus.  Let's go to Ed in Buffalo.  Ed.  Yeah.  Hey.  I was just wondering.  Oh, good morning.  Good morning.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, mister.  It's not his birthday.  Can't wait to see you on the 23rd.  Ed, I was just wondering how come you're no longer on Jay Moore's hit show, Gary Young 
[02:01:00]  Mary.  It was a funny show.  I see the glass is more than half full.  You know, I did 12 wonderful episodes of it.  They redid the whole second season.  And, you know, my hat's off to him.  It's a funny show.  I'll still watch it.  He's a very funny guy, and the writers are good.  But 12 episodes, and, you know, I had a ball.  So, you know, I'm on to other things.  Doing my show, Living with Ed, premiering October 21st on Planet Green.  And, but I love that show. 
[02:01:30]  It's funny.  Planet Green is like, is every cable provider care of that?  Because I've never heard of it.  Yes.  Not in every cable venue, but it's on most of them and growing.  It's part of Discovery Channel.  What's the most annoying thing you do, like, that your wife just wants to smack you for,  but she has to live with?  There's got to be something you do, like, she's like, all right, I'll tolerate everything,  but not this shit.  She hates the rain barrel.  I got a big orange rain barrel out back.  She hates it.  So, again, I will get rid of it.  I put a big cistern underground for the gray water. 
[02:02:00]  I'm going to put the rain water in there, too.  What's gray water?  Problem solved.  Gray water is from your shower, your laundry, your bathtub, and your bathroom sink.  All that is gray water that is very easily filtered.  By the time I'm done with it, it's no longer gray.  It's really residential recycle water.  I use it to irrigate not just ornamental plants, but I can use it on my food crops,  on my corn and my tomatoes.  It's very clean water when I'm done with it.  Oh, you grow your own food?  I grow, yeah.  I grow corn, tomatoes, lettuce.  Cheaper.  It's cheaper.  Again.  I make my own compost and all the old table scraps and whatever clippings and leaves I have 
[02:02:30]  and all that stuff.  You're busy.  It seems very like a lot of work.  It sounds exhausting.  It doesn't take a lot of work.  I don't have to stand there, you know, you turn the compost once a day.  It takes like 30, 60 seconds to turn the compost barrel or to turn it with a pitchfork.  It doesn't take a lot of time.  And then you're done for another day.  It's looking like it's 1850.  Well, there's some wisdom in the old ways.  You're turning compost with a pitchfork.  Exactly. 
[02:03:00]  Why waste that perfectly good organic matter?  Have them put it on a trash truck and put a landfill where it's poisoned with all the old  lacquer thinner cans or whatever the hell is in a landfill.  See, I agree.  Oh, you're being sarcastic.  Okay, I actually agreed.  No, I'm serious.  We're getting the wrap-up sign, but one last question.  You could get electricity out of cow shit?  We learned that on this new season?  On the show, I take my wife.  I promised her.  I said, we're going to go up north to wine country.  I'm going to take you up north to wine country.  That turned out to be Lodi, which is in the Central Valley.  I didn't take her to Napa as she was hoping, and I'd take her to a methane facility. 
[02:03:30]  Take her to Napa.  A methane facility.  They take all the cow detritus, all the cow waste, and they put it into the thing, and  there's methane that comes off that.  It's a giant lake of cow waste and methane, and then they use that to run a generator to  make a lot of electricity.  I mean, a lot.  So instead of checking out the vineyards, she's checking that out.  She was less than thrilled, guys.  You must have a hell of a piece for her to stay with you.  Ed's got to be packing.  Ed's got to be a nine-plus man, because she's dealing with a lot of crap, man. 
[02:04:00]  She's putting up with a lot.  I'm a lucky man.  That's all I can say.  Let's start.  When is it?  October 21st, Planet Green.  It's a wonderful show, Living with Ed, and my wife is great on it.  She's a patient woman.  You know what?  You made me...  Now I've got to check out another show, Ed.  Now I've got to DVR another goddamn show because of you.  I wasn't going to watch this crap.  Just watch one.  Now I've got to watch.  It's good.  After talking to you, we've got to watch now.  Yeah.  And I might, you know, I might take one day and not take out my Cobra Super Snake Shelby 
[02:04:30]  Mustang.  It's 720 horsepowers of supercharged madness.  That's right.  By the way, when I drove from Nassau County out to Suffolk County, half a tank of gas.  Half a tank.  It was crazy.  Is that good or is that bad?  We've got to get you a Tesla so you can get the same acceleration, but it'll be electric.  That's what we've got to get you.  There we go.  Same acceleration.  Same acceleration.  It's really quick.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to Ed Begley Jr.  Thank you. 
[02:05:00]  Come by and see us again.  Anytime.  I love you guys.  All right.  Fantastic.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony Cumia's Seminar for a Greener Planet.  I completely believe in global warming now, and we have to do something about this because  we're doing it.  Recycle.  Join Anthony in his fight for a cleaner world.  A second ice age coming if we don't watch out.  Anthony Cumia's Seminar for a Greener Planet.  The ice caps are melting, Opie.  The ice caps.  Ten years.  Europe can be frozen.  Armageddon is right around the corner in your lifetime. 
[02:05:30]  Make the world a better tomorrow for your children and your children's children.  Let's say by the day after tomorrow, we're pretty much done.  The Anthony Cumia Seminar for a Greener Planet on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F.U. to tequila and beer.  Hey, fuck you.  I just fucked my first fat girl and I'm 31 years old. 
[02:06:00]  I did not need to do that.  And I'm probably going to get a D.U.I. on the ride home and fuck you even more.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes off to my eight-year-old nephew who thought it'd be hysterical  to hit me in the sack with his little plastic bag.  You little fuck, he detached my testicle.  Fuck you, you old-powered little fuckhead.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to say a big fuck you to my daughter who continues to shit in the house. 
[02:06:30]  That's enough of that.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Jim from New Jersey.  I want to give a big F.U. or fuck you out to my soon-to-be ex-wife Anita and her goddamn fucking dyke  girlfriend, Patricia.  I hope you fucking both rot in hell because you fucking destroyed the kids' lives and my life.  Next message.  Sally Field.  We get it.  Brittle bones.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm trying to listen to the fucking Detroit game, you cunt. 
[02:07:00]  And you're on in between every half inning.  Fuck you.  Next message.  This fuck you goes out to myself.  I'm 41 years old and I'm a douchebag.  And it took me 41 years to figure out that I'm a douchebag.  So fuck you, me.  Wait, what?  Next message.  This message is for Nina.  Fuck you.  We're going to get married.  And then you all of a sudden decide that you don't want to be with me anymore.  And you're not sure if you were ever in love with me.  Hey, Nina. 
[02:07:30]  Fuck you.  Next message.  Hello, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  And I'd like to send a big FU out to Afu and Anthony for not appreciating the mysteries of the universe.  Okay.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Okay, listen up.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice. 
[02:08:00]  Are you ready?  Yeah, hold on.  I forgot to put in the crystals.  Okay, turn it off.  You fired a series 197 XM 202.  We're going to be doing some Jacktober in a few minutes here.  I love Jacktober.  What's up, Jimmy?  What's up?  I just want to plug this weekend.  I'm going to be in Virginia first time in a long time.  Virginia Beach, the Funny Bone Comedy Club.  There's no phone number on here, but go to vbfunnybone.com and you can see me.  And also Friday, October 23rd, my Buffalo show is sold out. 
[02:08:30]  The 8 o'clock show at 1030 has been added at the town ballroom.  That will probably sell out as well.  What day is that?  Saturday?  No, it's a Friday night, October 23rd.  I think I want to fly up for that.  I haven't hit the road with you in a while, Jimmy.  You should come to Buffalo, man.  That would be a nice one before it gets too cold up there.  Too late.  People know that the October 29th date was changed from October 2nd.  I hope nobody showed up at my theater shows in Ohio.  They did.  Did they?  Yeah, I got a lot of complaints all week.  All pissed off.  My phone was ringing off the hook.  Where's Jimmy?  Where's Jimmy?  It was ridiculous.  Those boobs.  You should take care of your fans better, Jimmy. 
[02:09:00]  Fuck them.  Let's see.  Business owner uses the N-word on sign outside his establishment.  Oh, yeah?  There's a bit of a problem.  Can we try to guess what kind of business he owned or will that get us fired?  Sleeve salesman?  That's about the only way you'd get away with it.  Or did he rig things?  Oh, no way.  Did you get it?  What?  I think Jimmy might have gotten it.  Jimmy's close. 
[02:09:30]  What happened?  Not necessarily the company, but Jimmy's very, very close.  Oh, you might have got a bell?  I'm guessing.  Give yourself a bell, Jimmy.  I can't.  Ting-a-ling.  Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.  Oh, there it is.  No, this is like a backup bell.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, it's got the very poor ring on that one.  Oh, it is?  Ah, I like that.  That's good.  Well, let's get into the story before we move into Jocktober.  The owner says the sign is about health care, but there's another message.  In fact, it's so offensive we had to blur it out tonight. 
[02:10:00]  I asked the restaurant owner the tough question.  I don't get that.  It's so offensive that we had to blur it out.  What is that doing?  Everyone knows what the word is.  It's not news.  It's the news.  So, unfortunately, you've got to, like, show it.  He had the word nigger in his sign.  Right.  And the news is blurring it out.  You're the news.  Yeah.  Guess what?  A lot of the news is offensive.  There was a story on the other day about a synagogue that had swastikas painted on it.  And it was obviously done by, like, kids, dopes, because they were the wrong way. 
[02:10:30]  They were not proportioned properly.  Didn't we all make swastikas growing up?  Yeah, everybody made them.  We didn't even know what it meant.  You didn't know what it meant.  You just thought it was cold or something like that.  But they actually, the whole broadcast, every time they showed the outside of the church,  they had blurred out every single swastika.  I have a big problem with that.  It's like, why?  It's the news.  It's the news.  We understand you can show that.  They show offensive stuff all the time.  Yeah, show dead people.  Dead people.  It's okay to show dead people and blood and guts and this and that, but not that. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Tough question.  Why he did it?  When you walk into the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar in Paulding County, you feel like you've  walked into a different era.  Behind the pool tables, a mannequin in a Ku Klux Klan costume.  But it's what's out.  What the fuck is going on?  Oh, man.  It seemed, this country.  Maybe this country went a little far.  This country will always be divided. 
[02:11:30]  Who are you kidding?  Maybe he went a little further.  Ku Klux Klan costume.  But it's what's outside Patrick Lanzo's restaurant that has some people angry.  I mean, why did you put that sign up out there?  I've been putting signs up for 22 years.  And I've put all kind of political signs up.  But this goes beyond a political sign.  Drivers read it as they go by.  It says Obama's plan for health care.  The N-word, rig it.  There's a way.  You're the news.  Say it.  Nigger rig it.  That's what he said.  You're the news. 
[02:12:00]  Children.  You're actually giving the word more power by not saying it.  N-word, rig it.  N-word.  You can say it.  N-word.  We're children.  Fucking asshole country we are.  We're children.  God, what's the matter?  Is the news afraid?  Or are people afraid they're going to like the way it feels coming out too much?  I mean, when you're reporting on it, if you're reporting on it and it's an accurate report  and you're not, then fucking say the word.  Oh, when you're driving, it's a treat.  Oh, yeah.  It feels good there.  They're allowing, they're making it easier for more people to use the word because now  we just safely say the N-word. 
[02:12:30]  But people are afraid to say the word nigger when they're reporting on it.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  Right.  It's written there on the sign.  Read the fucking sign.  And they block it out on the news.  Don't show that word.  Then don't do the story.  Don't do the story.  Then just don't do the story.  Isn't it amazing how a word has just become this thing that you can't say, you can't think,  you can't look at?  You can't report on?  You can't report on it?  Like, look, it's blocked out on the fucking news. 
[02:13:00]  She's saying the N-word instead of the fucking say the word because it's part of the story.  It's the story.  It's not one word anymore.  And that's something we brought up in the beginning too.  Now they're adding more words to that list.  So then, you know, people will find a way around that and then we'll have to ban that  new word.  Yep.  It'll never end.  Just fucking let it fly.  This is the one that's amazing.  Let the ugliness fly.  That's part of being an American.  This word is amazing though because they just will not show it. 
[02:13:30]  Not even to show it written.  Right.  Amazing.  And then you turn on like a hip-hop channel and it's every other fucking verse.  It's not going to stop.  It doesn't make sense.  It's not going to...  We're just a reactionary bunch of fucking fruits.  That's what our whole country is.  Totally.  What are they trying for?  Jesus.  You guys want some knowledge on this particular establishment?  Yeah.  And look, the guy's obviously a racist.  Let him be.  I've never been more scared to go to the phones.  Rob.  Listen to this one.  Rob in Georgia. 
[02:14:00]  Rob.  Hey man, I'm just calling to let you know that I was born and raised in Georgia.  I'm a white man and unfortunately, it's well known that this bar, they have about three  tar pits within two miles of the place where they get black guys drugged to drown them.  They know the police ain't going to wait through it to look for them.  The police.  The police.  The police.  All right.  That's what Rob said.  Fuck up, man.  I mean, that place needs to go down.  All right.  Well, I've never heard that.  Yeah, I haven't either.  There's a pretty large jump there between, you know, putting a word up on a sign and killing 
[02:14:30]  people.  And a Klan hood.  Yeah.  Why would you?  If you had a Klan hood and that sign, why would you kill people too?  It's like too obvious.  Who do you think it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Numero uno suspect.  There's a way to express your opinion without being divisive and using the N word.  Why did you choose to use the N word? 
[02:15:00]  Well, I've used the N word most of my life.  And there is different ways to put your opinion up, but that's just the words I choose to use.  Good.  You know what?  He's an idiot and he's a racist, but that's his right to be a racist.  He's allowed to be.  And that fucking reporter, why do you have to be divisive?  Anytime you disagree, it's divisive, you dumb bitch.  Why?  With freedom of speech, he should absolutely be able to display that sign. 
[02:15:30]  He will have to take consequences for it.  Um, but it's not like, you know, having the news come down and just put that holier than  now attitude on it.  Oh, it's so irritating.  Like Jimmy said, obviously he's a moron.  He's, you know, he's obviously a racist.  Uh, but the whole thing with the United States is being able to do that.  You're able to do that.  Yeah.  First amendment.  Gone.  Part two.  The reporter hits the streets for the man on the street audio, which is perfect. 
[02:16:00]  It's, it's, it's, it's my favorite part of every, uh, I wonder what people will be saying.  I don't know.  What do you think?  You think they're going to get people that agree that it's offensive?  Well, I don't think that it's right that he puts that.  Uh, it's just not necessary.  The N word.  Did he put that on the set?  Well, I don't think that's good.  And that I know I don't agree with that.  No.  Oh, really?  Don't you?  You guys are way off.  Yeah.  Oh, is he going to be like this? 
[02:16:30]  Well, it's about goddamn time.  Well, you know, he's my neighbor, been my neighbor for years.  And, uh, I agree with the sign.  I think it should be put up in more places, like by the Sitgo station, where a lot of them  get the gas.  A lot of them get the gas.  Let's see.  Let's see what direction she takes with that.  Lanzo says he's not a racist.  Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela.  He showed us some of the pictures around his bar.  He even pulled out his 2005 NAACP membership card.  He says this sign is about health care, not race. 
[02:17:00]  I stand by my president, but I also stand by the right under the First Amendment to criticize  him if I feel he's wrong.  This is the sign that's outside of that bar.  I showed some people around town the sign on my camera phone.  Why?  They say Lanzo is dishing out a full serving of hate.  Well, it should in 2008, 2009, 10, or it just shouldn't be there, period.  I go by there, and I just think he's a racist. 
[02:17:30]  I'll hate him.  Now, I called the, uh, Paulding County Commissioner for this area, and he says he contacted the  attorney for this area, and he says this sign is protected under free speech.  Of course it is.  Yeah, you should know that, you dumb broad.  Why do you have to fucking broadcast it, dummy?  You might not like it, but it's protected.  Why do you have to contact the commissioner?  The fucking media, you worthless pieces of shit.  All you try to do is create a story.  Right.  Instead of just reporting on one that's there. 
[02:18:00]  That is an absolute example, Jim.  You're perfectly right.  An absolute example of the press making the story.  She shouldn't get involved and start fucking ratting people out so the story gets better.  You report, hey, the guy's got this sign.  It offends some people.  Use the word, fucking, don't blur it out, and then you move on.  And most people didn't even know that sign existed until the news.  Stop.  That's fucking everyone's attention.  They're repulsive.  They're just repulsive, the media, because they're not honest about what they do.  Let's go to Gail in Connecticut. 
[02:18:30]  Gail.  Gail.  Gail, how you doing?  You guys are freaking shit.  No, this guy, I think he's full of shit.  He would have said so.  Hey, I hate him at an emergency in the first place.  When the, I'm sorry, the, I'm nervous.  When the interviewer was interviewing him, because, you know, he's just, I think he's  just trying to get attention.  And, I think what you're trying to say is that he didn't actually say the word when he  was being interviewed, right?  Exactly, exactly. 
[02:19:00]  I'm sorry.  I can't believe I got on so quick.  So, Gail, quickly, what do you think the problem is?  Quickly.  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah, quick, quick, quick.  What?  What do you think the problem is?  What exactly do you think that he was doing?  The thing to do with the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  We don't have much time.  Go.  No, because he didn't.  He wanted people to say, hey, look at my store.  I hate niggers.  And come down and have a beer.  You know what I mean?  Because you probably figure, probably most of your wife, you better go there.  Oh, shoot.  He's got a bad freaking connection. 
[02:19:30]  He actually worked a little better under pressure.  No, he did work better.  I was so funny watching him just unravel for a second.  I'm nervous.  I can't die.  I would love to hear that again.  He was just, I, I, the guy, I think, the guy was, what?  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  We got backstage with ONA, the staff fight.  I want to hear that.  And we got Jack Tober, everyone.  Who did the staff fight first?  Because I was not privy to that.  Staff fight, then Jack Tober.  I love staff fights.  Oh, Jimmy, you would have loved it on Friday, man.  Steve doesn't want to be teased about his food.  We all get teased about stuff. 
[02:20:00]  We all get teased about stuff.  I know it's sensitive for him, but, you know, I'm sorry.  We got to do it.  Well, that's what teasing is based on.  You don't tease someone on something that he's okay with.  Hey, you look great.  Hey, let's make fun of your muscles.  Right.  It's always some fucking thing that you're doing wrong, right?  Yeah, of course.  All right.  Here's, well, what happened, Sam?  You went backstage after Friday's show to see if everyone's all right?  Well, I figured I'd prefer to do interviews at 5 o'clock this morning.  Ah.  So I'm waiting until this morning.  Yes, wait until the smoke cleared a little bit.  There's a lot of people asking for an update. 
[02:20:30]  The update is that everyone's walking around like it didn't happen Friday.  What can I tell you?  It is the strangest environment ever.  What I found to be the strangest thing out of everything is that, like, this is nothing new.  Like, this happens probably quarterly.  Everybody's waiting until about three months from now when these same tensions rise to the surface and the exact same fight happens.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I'm going to do that bit.  What bit?  I like this idea.  David P.A.  And I see these dummies in my neighborhood all the time.  Go ahead, Dave. 
[02:21:00]  I just want to say you guys should make the news crews, that one particular reporter,  make her the news story, hound her ass, chase her down, and ask her why she was making such a big deal out of this.  All right.  I'm going to take that task on.  That's right down my fucking alley.  Tell me where the fucking news people are going to be.  Especially, I need one where they're going to be in front of someone's house that lost a child or a loved one in some horrific way,  and they're all bummed out because they don't want to make any comments as they're banging on their fucking front door. 
[02:21:30]  Behind this door, the store of grief.  Right, right.  Get me where they're going to be.  Someone put me on high alert as far as this goes.  If you see a news crew that's close to where I live, I will go there and ask the questions.  There you go.  Dave, thank you.  I thank you in advance.  Yeah, it's got to be one of those, you know, the stories that they take on.  They try to make it.  And you go, why are they at their house?  For their own self-interest. 
[02:22:00]  Of course.  It's not about reporting.  It's not about reporting the news.  It's about getting themselves, making it.  That's why they're so obsessed with exclusives.  If you're really held to a different set of standards with language and content because you're the news,  why the fuck should you worry about exclusives other than the fact that it's to boost up your network,  to boost your ratings for more advertising dollars, which is the exact same fucking goal as a comedy show or drama.  I've got to give you something for that, Jimmy.  Co-fucking-K!  Thank you.  You know, Patrice said that whole thing with N-word, too, is just like, now everyone can say it. 
[02:22:30]  Where you used to, you know, the news wouldn't just blurt out the word nigger.  But now it's like N-word, N-word, N-word.  Everyone knows what it means.  So they could use it now any time they want.  And Michael Richards pushed this into the forefront.  Like, everyone knew it was.  But that's the final straw that broke the camel's back was Michael Richards.  This dumb fucking country allowed the guy that played Kramer to fucking push this forward that harshly. 
[02:23:00]  And he is on Curb Your Enthusiasm and doing just fine.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A couple years go by, look.  Good, he should be.  He's back right where he should be.  All right, so Sam interviewed the staff about the big fight on Friday.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  Last week on the O&A show, E-Rock taking twit pics of Steve's enormous breakfast led to an entire staff meltdown. 
[02:23:30]  A conflict between Steve and E-Rock quickly became a conflict between Steve and Danny that left the whole world wondering, would the staff of the show survive?  We reached out to E-Rock this morning to get an update.  After the big meltdown that you started on Friday, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling okay.  I had no problem this weekend.  And how are things with you and Steve?  I guess okay.  Right after the show, he came over and apologized and gave me an unnecessary hug, which I accepted. 
[02:24:00]  And how excited are you about your new character?  Vic Dumb.  Eric, what are you...  Ow!  While E-Rock used physical violence to avoid backstage reporters, we moved on to Steve and Danny to see if the two had worked out their differences.  Steve.  Yeah.  After last week's staff meltdown, how are you doing?  I'm doing surprisingly well.  Thank you, Sam.  How do you think the staff is doing?  I think the staff is doing surprisingly well.  How is your relationship with Eric? 
[02:24:30]  Beautiful.  We kissed and made up after the show Friday.  And the same with Danny?  Eric and I are doing great.  How about...  And Danny and you are also great.  Eric is one of the sweetest boys I've ever met.  Did you mean Danny or Eric?  I can't say enough good things about Eric.  So then, you and Danny have not buried the hatchet.  You know, I've tried to reach out in the past to Danny, and so far, he just doesn't want to talk to me.  I hope that changes in the future, but right now, I have no control over that. 
[02:25:00]  Hey, Danny.  After last week's staff blowout, how is everything?  Which is fine.  So everything between, like, you and Eric?  Why would it be so cool?  Okay, cool.  And you and Steve?  Oh, it's just the same as it ever was.  So, basically terrible.  Of course, yeah.  Why?  There's no reason for it not to be.  But do you see that, you know, the confrontation that happened kind of brought issues to the forefront,  and maybe we'll come to a resolution?  I hope they do.  I pray they come to resolutions.  Do you see that happening?  Never. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  Ah, no underlining hostility there.  Obviously, Steve and Danny have conflicting points of view,  and backstage can only assume that their ability to coexist in the same working area will continue to deteriorate.  However, there is one thing that ONA fans can look forward to.  Hours and hours of material from E-Rock's brand new character, Vic Dumb.  Let's all enjoy laughing at Vic's stupidity as the show crumbles around us.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA. 
[02:26:00]  There's no clips, though, of the actual yelling.  I want to hear somebody yelling at somebody.  Oh, well, you had to be here Friday.  It has an hour and 40 minutes.  No, I mean, just point the first yell.  Who started the first yell?  It wasn't even, I don't know.  I kind of got into it, and then Patrice was like, get Steve in here.  It was a slow build, trust me.  And Steve came in.  Made it up with movie lines.  It was one for the ages.  It was a good one.  Yeah.  Went from Platoon to Apocalypse Now to Jaws to, oh, it was just, it was a, it was a. 
[02:26:30]  It was all goofing on Steve and his giant breakfast.  We didn't get out of here until, I think, 11th.  Going to need a bigger plate.  Yeah, yeah, there was that.  There was, my, one of my favorites was French fries goes in.  Fries go in the basket.  Fries go in the basket.  Basket goes in the oil.  Can I tell you, I watched Jaws on the plane going out to fucking L.A.  It was one of the choices.  Yeah.  And it's just great.  Yeah, it really is.  I still watch it. 
[02:27:00]  It's still good.  Pop that fucker on.  Blue cheese salad.  What's that, lasagna and fries?  It's really bad.  No, it's like an omelet with ketchup or something.  I don't know.  That's just a lot of food.  And there's chicken and lettuce, which is healthy until you dump the Elmer's glue blue cheese on it.  It's like any one of these things isn't necessarily terrible in the proper portion.  One fry.  But this is like, this is at least four portions per Tupperware, and there's three of them.  So you're looking at 12 portions of food here.  Yeah.  Four portions.  Yeah.  He said four portions per Tupperware. 
[02:27:30]  I know.  It's packed.  It's true.  It's true, though.  Proper portion size is important.  I hate the word portions.  I do, too.  It just sounds too, like, too restricting and too mothering, like you have a good, a healthy,  because the Nortons were notorious for our lousy portions.  Portions.  What kind of portions did you do?  Mother gave out horrible portions of good food.  Small.  Just small portions?  Terrible portions.  Also, the K-mutiny.  He was talking about how many portions.  Yes. 
[02:28:00]  He had more portions, you know.  Taking the sand to represent the strawberries.  Strawberries.  Well, guys, it's time.  It's time.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  One-third of the women polled said they do this right after a breakup.  My guess is tickle their clit with a rake.  It's a celebration of craptastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  A little more specific.  That's pretty good.  That's the whole thing we did. 
[02:28:30]  She looks like every actress who was, like, a really hot teenager who's battling cancer later in life.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Now, it's Jocktober on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't get to do Jocktober Friday because of the big fight, so we're a little behind.  Who do we look at today there, Sam?  Well, last year, we looked at, remember Lander?  You know John Lander, Lander in the morning?  Vaguely, yeah.  He's in Boston.  He was in Boston for, like, 20 years.  They got rid of him.  He was a New York guy, too. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, they got rid of him, though.  Really?  Yeah.  He was making too much money.  They replaced him with this couple named Carson and Kennedy, who, even though you might think they're married, they're not.  Wow.  You mean they sound like they're married?  They do.  They sound a little like they're married.  I like your theme this year.  There's a theme with Jocktober.  Last year, we focused on the whole and the fake, edgy morning guys.  Yeah.  This year, it's the couples that, are they married?  We're not really too sure.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  It's the man and woman teams all over America just pouring the shit out of everyone.  And I believe, I looked them up on, like, some other websites.  I think they came from Memphis.  They haven't been in Boston long, obviously, less than a year because we, and, however, they are now very big fans of a lot of the Boston area.  Yeah, keep it local.  Keep it local.  Keep it local, guys.  I mean, if you guys want to take a wild guess at some of their favorite sports teams.  Really?  From before this?  Memphis?  Memphis, I believe. 
[02:30:00]  They had no clue about Boston sports until they got the big radio gig.  Yeah, we should tear down that wall today.  Your local morning show that is local and seems all about that area is from somewhere else.  Nine out of ten times that person is a transplant.  And when they first start, they actually have a piece of paper in front of them with the major highways, where the traffic is.  Do they really?  Yes.  We might have did that.  We might have had that.  And the sports teams and, you know, some of the players, you've got to be able to... 
[02:30:30]  It's a one sheet.  Rattle that off.  Fucking hell.  Radio fucking stinks!  You know, I was on Route 9 going through Natick.  We did this, actually.  Last night.  And I've got to tell you.  They made us drive the signal once.  Yeah.  It's called driving the signal.  Bruce Mittman goes, guys, I'm giving you the day off today.  We were very green to the Boston market.  And I'm like, God damn, this is great. 
[02:31:00]  He goes, but I want you to drive the signal today.  How far did we drive?  A half hour?  I said, that's good enough?  Fuck it.  Got it.  Then we got our day off.  We were supposed to drive the whole diameter of where the fucking station...  Literally gave us a map with a huge circle on it would be, you know, the range of the  radio station.  It's like the blast radius of a hydrogen bomb, and we're supposed to fucking drive the periphery.  Regular radio is fucking boring and shit.  Phony.  It's completely fucking phony.  And can they stop...  Can people stop adoring these radio guys who just do that garbage right? 
[02:31:30]  Bah!  Hit the post.  And they love him on, like, the New York Radio Wrestling Board.  Bah!  He was a good radio jock!  No, he wasn't.  He was fucking part of the problem.  A phony fucking boar who talked over the music.  It's a jukebox.  Now there's a talented...  He got a jukebox.  That was a talented guy.  Fucking horrible.  That was a talented guy.  You know what?  Speaking of which, this is an important day in radio history.  Forty years ago today, this happened. 
[02:32:00]  A DJ did this.  A DJ started this.  Whip him out Wednesday?  Whip him out Wednesday.  Don't say it.  Forty years ago.  Anybody want to...  Run around the park for Aaron?  Favorite bit ever that we couldn't do.  Yep.  Favorite bit ever that we couldn't do.  Right.  We finally did feels for meals, but run around the park for Aaron was my favorite bit we  could never do.  Stole that from Scorch, though.  We had a woman that agreed to do the bit.  Who I wound up dating for a year and a half. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, she did.  What's wrong with having a girl run around the park and then setting our listeners...  Our listeners?  Our listeners loose trying to find her, and then they have to rip like a tag off her or  something, like a flag.  Yeah, they got a problem.  Like a touch football flag.  They had a problem with the name.  Why?  I don't know.  Is that a park?  I don't know.  It's an acronym.  An acronym.  Yeah.  For...  Yeah.  And the sponsors were on board.  We had great prizes.  Yeah.  And they were going to spend the afternoon trying to find her. 
[02:33:00]  It was an acronym for...  RAPF...  RAPF-E.  Jimmy, you think that would have been a problem with management?  Yeah.  What would management say?  Well, the current legal team here would have a certain problem with it.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Even if our contract said we could do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get into Jacktober.  Yeah.  Oh, you want to know what happened four years ago?  We don't have to make this a big thing.  The Paul is Dead theory began when a DJ played Revolution No. 9 backwards. 
[02:33:30]  Wow.  There's your radio history for today.  That's what that guy's known for.  Awesome.  What a zilch.  What a zilch.  Fantastic.  You think he walks around bragging about that?  You know that Paul is Dead?  No, I don't know that.  Of course he does.  You think that's all he talks about?  Of course he does.  He brings it up everywhere.  Everywhere.  Like the Beatles?  Really?  I've heard this.  He tries to comfortably sing into it.  Somehow get onto the Beatles talk and what he did four years ago. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  It's just like he really did something that caught on.  No one fucking cares.  There was no internet then, stupid.  I'm bored with that.  Really?  So then what happened?  Oh, shut up.  That's what I'd like to do.  Get him started and then scream at him.  Can we get him on the phone?  Yeah.  I want to talk to the guy today because it's a big day in radio history.  So what exactly made you do that?  I'm serious for the guys down the hall.  Find him.  Well, you know, I kind of no one cares.  No one gives a shite. 
[02:34:30]  Let's get him on the phone, please, Sam.  Okay.  All right.  So it's Carson and Kennedy.  They're from Memphis.  They've been in Boston less than a year, and they sound like they know everything about Boston.  You wouldn't know it listening to them.  Here we go.  Jocktober, everyone.  It's kind of a big weekend, I guess, for peeping leaves or leaf peepers.  Obviously, being still relatively new to New England, I had never heard the term, had you?  No.  So people have been calling in with all sorts of suggestions as to where because Lan and I were going to try.  All right.  No one calls in. 
[02:35:00]  No.  With their suggestions about leaf peepers.  They might have called in and said, use Afrin, you congested idiot.  He sounds like this.  Sorts of suggestions as to where because Lan and I were going to try and do that this afternoon.  We have no idea where to go.  None whatsoever.  And I'm no help.  All right.  Thanks.  You'll be at home taking a nap recovering from last night's party.  Uh-uh. 
[02:35:30]  Good morning.  Who's this?  What is this?  So far, we got a couple...  Jimmy, you all right with this?  It's very terrific stuff so far.  I got to hear what happened.  Where do they leaf peep?  Hopefully Roxbury.  Fuck it.  They're holding up a leaf and a black fist crashed through it and broke their fucking noses.  An app recovering from last night's party.  Uh-uh.  Good morning. 
[02:36:00]  Who's this?  Good morning.  This is Summer.  How are you?  Hummer?  Summer.  Summer.  Oh, sorry.  What is wrong with you, man?  Ooh.  Wow.  Why is it wrong that he made a blowjob reference, you uptight, awful fucking co-host?  What's wrong with that?  What is wrong with you to imply cock sucking?  I don't do that ever.  Fuck you.  She's fucking horrible.  That's why we fucking hate women. 
[02:36:30]  Well, on the radio.  Anywhere.  Thank God you have pussies.  I enjoy women.  On the radio, not so much.  Not so much.  Not at all.  These dumb holes, they all have to go.  We still with our thing?  Get rid of the whole campaign?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  What's wrong with you?  How could you?  Fuck you, lady.  Shut up.  That's why guys don't think you're fucking funny.  What guys are hanging out going Hummer?  What?  Cut the boat. 
[02:37:00]  What?  Hey.  Malarkey.  Hey.  What is that?  Wow.  Hummer?  Summer.  Summer.  Oh, sorry.  What is wrong with you, man?  I thought she said Hummer.  Serious to God, you thought her name was Hummer.  Serious to God?  Wow.  Serious to God.  He must be a fun fuck.  Wow, man.  She is bad hole.  Yeah.  Bad hole.  That's Kennedy.  Bad hole.  Bad hole.  Bad hole.  Hit her on the nose with a newspaper.  Serious to God. 
[02:37:30]  Exactly.  What?  Should have been XM to shit.  Get it?  Because they lost the merger.  They get beat up.  How did XM lose the merger?  I don't know.  I'm still trying to figure out that one.  A certain dumpster breath idiot that used to fucking have a certain position of power?  Oh.  That tool.  How the fuck do we lose that one?  Still confused by that.  Yeah, whatever.  It's all right, man.  The old boss.  Same as the new boss.  New boss.  Same as the old boss.  No, not quite.  Man.  Well, no.  Not quite. 
[02:38:00]  Not at all.  You know what?  I'd work for Mel any day.  Mel?  Compared to what we had.  Mel's fine.  Let me tell you something.  There's no choice there ever.  The people under Mel I have an issue with.  Oh, yeah.  All of them.  Some of them.  Every single one of them.  Yeah.  Some.  No, all of them.  Right?  Not.  Not all of them.  Yeah, see?  You're not.  I'll tell you.  You thought her name was Hummer.  Maybe her father was a fan of the automobile named Hummer.  Oh, my God.  Summer, I am so sorry, dude. 
[02:38:30]  And now she has to apologize for that?  What are they apologizing for?  He mispronounced her name.  I am so sorry, dude.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe he did that.  Jesus.  I'm so sorry.  I haven't apologized that much when I've slipped somebody a fucking day after drug.  It meant that to come out better.  Morning after.  Day after.  Day after.  God.  I'm tired.  Oops.  Waited too long. 
[02:39:00]  Should have been this morning.  Exactly.  And punt.  We'll do one of those today.  And one of these.  Special endeavor.  Endeavor.  Just because it's right there.  All right.  Let's continue with Carson and Kennedy.  I think this is our old radio company.  Mixed one on 4.1.  I think.  Is that CBS?  Is that a CBS station?  They're very good.  Heaven to Megatron movie man from Brooklyn.  I'm so sorry, dude.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe. 
[02:39:30]  Stop, you twat.  Got some text messages.  Kennedy.  Okay.  Let's see.  5094 says take a ride on the Congamangus Highway.  Congamangus.  I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.  It's just purely out of my ignorance.  Oh, God.  The madness is ensuing, isn't it?  Imagine waking up with that every morning.  No. 
[02:40:00]  Doing radio with that.  What do you look like, Danny?  Do you have photos of these people?  Mixed one on 4.1.  I will bet a lot of money she's a pig.  Oh, not Kennedy.  A Gregorio.  Come on.  That ain't right.  Jay.  Purely out of my ignorance.  9204.  Amherst has great foliage.  1070 says drive out route two.  Then you can stop anywhere to pick apples.  And then 0548 says hump. 
[02:40:30]  Ew.  What?  Both of them.  They're just awful.  Look at these two.  Stop and pick apples.  Oh, and it's Carson with a K.  Of course it is.  Carson and Kennedy.  So it's Carson and Kennedy.  So you have the two Ks.  Sure.  Like that.  Just another K, right, Ed?  Yes.  Because when you're rifling through the radio for something entertaining, you try to find  same letters.  Same letters.  Yes.  Assholes.  That means good show.  Well, the name, it sounds easier.  So that way it's easier for you to remember.  And then you'll sit in your car and say, remember that Carson and Kennedy show? 
[02:41:00]  I'd like to check them out.  Write it in the diary.  If you squint really hard, she's almost hot.  She's not.  Try it.  Squint really hard.  If you squint Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder hot or hard.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  You weren't tired on Leno, Jimmy.  No, but after that, I didn't sleep much in Colorado.  I'm really, really recovering.  Yeah, you got the weird fucking time zone thing.  Who does she look like?  She's got a pretty turtleneck on. 
[02:41:30]  She's not awful.  Turtlenecks.  Who does she look like?  She looks like that two weeks.  There you go.  Two weeks.  She looks like Tim Curry and fucking as Frankenfurter.  In any event.  So it's pretty much as everybody expected.  Brad Pitt and some other dudes for Best Actor.  Angelina and Kate.  All right, listen.  We are getting info.  This is the new BCN, by the way.  And she's dressed like a nun.  Oh, is it?  They got rid of BCN, made that into sports talk, and then moved the mix onto the BCN frequency. 
[02:42:00]  Cool.  Oh, great.  So this is what they think is better than what they had.  So these are the people that technically replaced Toucher and Rich on BCN?  Yeah.  Great move.  Yeah.  Excellent move.  Yeah.  Entertaining radio show.  Holy mackerel.  Ah, the foliage.  Yuck.  And they continue to keep their jobs.  It's amazing.  Mind-boggling, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Mind-boggling.  Amazing.  Yeah.  And then 0548 says Hummer. 
[02:42:30]  Ha ha, Carson, you're funny.  It was God's honest accident.  No, it wasn't.  It sounded like she said Hummer.  Come on, dude.  You couldn't hear the S when she said it.  You couldn't hear the S when she said it.  It sounded like she said Hummer.  I just thought she liked the car.  Be real.  I got a text message regarding where Gwen and I should go.  Leaf peeping today.  You're right.  From 0917.  Tell Larson in Hampton Falls to Hampton.  Whoa. 
[02:43:00]  Sure is laughing.  Looks like Carson's not the only one who can mispronounce someone's name.  Give me a break.  Wait.  They were mispronounced?  I didn't even get it.  Larson.  Not great.  Because his name's Carson.  She was laughing that hard over that?  Yes, and genuinely.  I thought it was some inside thing.  No, the texter said Larson.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  They are completely devoid of humor or entertainment.  I disagree.  Listen to her genuine laugh.  That was a very genuine laugh.  The Kennedy through Oswald's scope was funnier than this one. 
[02:43:30]  But aren't you guys ever worried that you're missing out on a certain percentage of the Massachusetts  audience because you're on satellite and you're not talking about where they can go locally  to pick apples?  Did you just talk?  Did you just say something?  I heard a buzzing noise.  Carson and Kennedy play It Sucks to Be Me and Freak the Fuck Out because someone on their  show likes a sports team that isn't local.  They have no idea what to do. 
[02:44:00]  Are you serious?  One of their producers says he's a Dolphins fan.  And so Carson and Kennedy just go, all right, we'll listen to the clip.  So tell us, why does it suck to be you today?  It sucks to be me.  Because I'm a listener of this program.  It sucks to be me.  Nothing going my way.  What a heck of a day.  It sucks to be me.  A heck of a day.  Ah, this sucks.  7076 Kennedy says it sucks to be me because I'm a diehard Miami Dolphins fan. 
[02:44:30]  Did they lose or something?  I guess so.  All right.  I don't think they've won a game this season, have they?  One game.  We?  We?  We?  Are you?  Wow.  Somebody here at the office is a, that's kind of weird.  It's weird that somebody at the office likes a different football team.  Yeah, what's random about that?  Are you kidding me?  That guy likes the Dolphins, you stupid bitch.  No, he's crazy.  He's supposed to like the Patriots.  Yeah, of course you are.  The Patriots. 
[02:45:00]  That's crazy.  That guy would probably be fired now for not liking the Patriots.  Well, nobody listening to that radio station is going to have, they're not going to be  able to relate to this show because their producer likes the Dolphins.  Is that show doing well?  It's...  I don't know their ratings.  I mean, I would assume so.  They're a good show.  Knowing regular radio, they're probably the number one show in Boston.  Fucking...  That show is abysmal.  Fucking don't know shit radio listener.  Not you.  Regular radio listeners.  Who are listeners? 
[02:45:30]  I said not you to them already.  No, we just say fuck you.  They've taken an incredibly uplifting sucks to be you call from a guy who's...  Well, let's just leave it right there.  Okay.  Big surprise for everyone right here.  Hey, Joe, why does it suck to be you?  It sucks to be me because we had to put our pet down because it had cancer, and so the  entire weekend was one of my...  Wow, Edgy, they're...  Oh, that's me.  That's you.  That wasn't... 
[02:46:00]  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why.  They're doing a death pet story.  Yes.  A death pet story.  God damn, how am I supposed to come out of an uptempo number and do a Hummer reference?  And this uptight bitch sitting next to me.  Hey, Joe, why does it suck to be you?  It sucks to be me because we had to put our pet down because it had cancer, and so the  entire weekend was one of my wife and I crying pretty much. 
[02:46:30]  I'm very sorry, Joe.  Hey, you know, we don't have any children, and the cat was sort of like, it was sort  of a lap cat for my wife, you know, and we had great attachment to it.  I know.  So, I know, you know, a lot of people are going like, it's just a cat.  No, dude, my dog was the most stable man in my life for 12 years.  You know, I mean, I'm sure that...  What does that mean?  With a nice jar of Jiffy.  All right.  All right, I wasn't sure if you were going to do the peanut butter one, and I would do 
[02:47:00]  oven mitts, or if you wanted to open with oven mitts.  I figured you'd go to oven mitts after peanut butter.  The most stable man in my life.  His little red lipstick, Dick.  Yes, I'd doze off and he'd fuck my face.  And he'd scratch my sides up.  Oh, come on.  Her dog's passed.  Oh, is it?  You see how cool she is, though?  Sorry.  It's not make sure.  Yeah, dude.  It's been the man in her life for 12 years.  No, dude. 
[02:47:30]  12 years.  She don't need a man because she has her dog.  Yeah.  People think it's ridiculous because it's just a cat.  It's like, no, no.  I understand.  Yes.  Who was the most stable man in my life for 12 years?  You know, I mean, I'm sure that he could have lived longer, but the thing is, we had to  make the decision.  She couldn't eat anymore.  Right.  But you know, she's in a better place now, so you've got to think that way.  What a fucking box.  I didn't think that way.  That's why we did it.  But it does suck to be me because of that, you know?  Aw. 
[02:48:00]  She found an old shoe box with some nuts and bolts in it and whatnot.  You guys do such stuff.  Warshers.  Warshers.  Yeah.  I reckon I heard him still meowing when I put the dirt on top.  She's not in a better place.  She went to some fucking pet cemetery where they burned her.  I think you should have taken care of that cat.  It would have grown up to be a good cat.  Sorry I told you that. 
[02:48:30]  You're just a boy.  You shouldn't hear certain.  I can't help it.  I never, I never don't want to hear that.  I always want to hear that.  A fucking big dolt Carl and his little brother that he just threw dirt on.  Little feller.  Probably all cold.  Oh, of course.  Ugh.  They play three things that make you happy.  That's kind of their, one of their big bits.  Another one of their big bits.  So those two and the producer, it's three consecutive gunshots. 
[02:49:00]  A murder suicide.  Playoff baseball in Boston, it just makes you happy.  Yes.  Friends and family also make you happy.  So you need to come up with three things.  Wait, what was that?  They're saying, you know, playoff baseball in Boston, that's a given.  That makes you happy.  But they're from Memphis.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, they're from Boston.  They're going leaf peeping and they like things from Boston.  They like the Patriots and the Red Sox. 
[02:49:30]  Sure.  And foliage.  What would be the, why would it be, why couldn't you just be honest on the radio and say,  look, I just moved here.  I'm trying to get into the Sox, this leaf peeping thing.  I don't understand.  No, that's right.  Because radio stinks.  That's why.  And then they would, and then the hardcore Boston people would call and try to explain,  you know, and then it would be a whole thing.  Instead of like jumping right in and making believe you're just one of your listeners.  That's crazy.  That'd never work.  It's crazy talk.  It's terrible.  Playoff baseball in Boston, it just makes you happy. 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  Friends and family also make you happy.  So you need to come up with three things other than Red Sox baseball or friends and  family that make you happy.  Three things, Kennedy, that make you happy.  The view at the Boston Harbor Hotel through the archway on a sunny day.  Another local reference.  Oh, man.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Fake pouring on references.  That makes her happy.  She was probably there once.  Maybe.  Could we get some other Boston references she may have?  Let's see.  Charles Stewart. 
[02:50:30]  My knowledge is way down now.  One bias.  Three of Mo Vaughn's fingers in my hiney.  Before we chased him out of Boston, too.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  You have to.  He was the wrong color.  What else makes you happy?  That make you happy.  Three things, Kennedy, that make you happy?  The view at the Boston Harbor Hotel through the archway on a sunny day is one of my favorite  things in the world.  Singing in the car at the top of my lungs and finding $5 in my jeans pockets.  This is fucking atrocious. 
[02:51:00]  Things I love.  Motorcycles.  The face.  The sun on my face.  Catching rain on my tongue.  Things I hate.  The sun on my face.  All right.  We get it.  Shut up, you big fucking headed goon.  You lunkhead.  Put those thumbtacks in your face.  Exactly.  Things I hate.  Empty maps on the wall.  Mom trying to wake me when I'm dead. 
[02:51:30]  Exactly.  And all these bikers doing meth while I lay there in my fucking own vomit.  Really?  Mom said I look like a lion.  Really?  Maybe they should have taken notice.  You don't look like a...  A major problem going down.  You don't look like a lion.  You look like a fucking...  A meth womb accident.  Mom says I look like a lion.  A lion.  What do you want mom to do?  Mom wants to shoot her own pussy off. 
[02:52:00]  She has to tell herself something.  For me, techno music.  Of course.  I just love the...  Tries me.  I bet you love it.  I bet you love it.  Axis.  Yeah.  Um, poppers and a hole in the bathroom stall wall.  Fucking...  An unclipped dick poking through a hole in the wall.  Techno music and...  My lungs.  And finding five dollars in my jeans pockets. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, we heard.  Uh, for me, techno music.  Of course.  I just love the...  Tries me to see.  Uh, lazing around on the leather couch watching golf.  Yes.  His voice is terrible.  And then, like, in and out of naps doing that.  And then I also...  A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Just to me is...  Why is that funny?  I don't know.  Why is that funny?  Why is that funny?  She likes la...  He likes lazing around.  Can we hear her laugh?  Wait, wait, wait.  When he comes in and out of naps, she doesn't laugh at the Hummer joke. 
[02:53:00]  No.  She doesn't like the blowjob joke.  No.  But the fact that he wakes up and probably drinks more and then passes back out, she finds very, very humorous.  It's a mask mask.  Sting around on the leather couch watching golf.  Yes.  And then, like, in and out of naps doing that.  And then I also...  A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Just to me is...  Steve, we'll do that after the break.  We got a big interview after the break.  A big interview. 
[02:53:30]  Big one.  Big interview after the break.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  Going to set a new record today.  New record going down.  I know it is.  And finally, they take a phone call from a listener named Steve.  Is this real?  Yes, I swear to God.  Who is happy about his gastric bypass surgery.  And then Sam writes, and they handle it differently than O&A would. 
[02:54:00]  Yes, we...  And then Carson's happy about three more things.  Well, I thought that was important to include.  But, yes, when Steve brings up his...  Our Steve brings up his gastric bypass surgery, we tend to handle things differently than when their Steve does.  And I think that maybe you guys should keep your ears open.  And these guys play music, right?  So they don't even have to come up with a lot of stuff every morning.  And this is all they come up with?  They'll milk, like, one of these call-in bits.  Right.  It'll be at least 30 minutes.  Ugh. 
[02:54:30]  Because they're playing songs.  They're saying, okay, we'll take five calls.  Then we'll play some songs.  Then we'll record calls while the songs are on.  Then we'll play those.  Look, what we do is really easy to begin with.  But can you imagine it?  No.  Going back to playing, like, 12 records an hour?  No.  Eight records an hour?  Oh, we'd be just laughing.  We'd be just hanging the whole time.  Steve, give us three things that make you happy other than friends or family.  Dicks, balls, and men's assholes.  Dicks, balls, and men's assholes. 
[02:55:00]  Dicks, fries, and yelling at Danny.  All right.  Let me try to get through this clip, Jimmy.  Okay?  Okay.  Steve, give us three things that make you happy other than friends or family.  Dicks, balls, and men's assholes.  Jimmy, I said let's try to get through the clip.  Okay.  I'll leave it alone.  Yeah, please.  Because, you know, we've got to go to break.  I've got to take a leak here. 
[02:55:30]  So please let this play out, Jimmy.  Steve, give us three things that make you happy other than friends or family.  Giant breakfasts, giant lunches, and men's assholes.  Jimmy, although funny, we're trying to get through this clip.  Can I play this?  You're going to shut up, right, Jimmy?  Uh, yes.  Steve, give us three things that make you happy other than friends or family.  Catching cum on my tongue and someone's son on my face. 
[02:56:00]  Anthony.  That's only two.  That's only two.  Oh, damn.  And men's assholes.  Oh, there you go.  The third is always men's assholes.  Oh, my tongue.  And somebody's son on my face.  Yes.  And putting pins in a map where all the best rest areas are. 
[02:56:30]  We were supposed to go, me and you.  Oh, every glory hole in your face.  Oh, I was a gross father.  Felt my big face through the hole in the urinal.  All right.  Can we try to get through the clip?  Please.  Somebody's son on my face.  I'm going to get through the clip now.  Here we go.  Steve, give us three things that make you happy other than friends or family.  Other than friends or family.  Like I said, number one, bypass surgery. 
[02:57:00]  Catastric bypass surgery.  That's a good one.  It is.  That's number one on the, you know.  And I know I'm going to be much happier, healthier.  What was that?  Ding.  Number one.  Ding.  Sort of say ding.  You know.  This is important.  Number one.  Somebody.  Somebody.  Bob says I look like a lion.  Shut up. 
[02:57:30]  Well, she's a lion.  Exactly.  You don't.  You look like a pile of tiger shit.  Little red hairs around it.  I never get tired of teasing him.  Stupid Rocky Dennis.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  No, you're lying.  I'm not lying.  It is.  That's number one on the, you know.  And I know I'm going to be a much happier, healthier person in a couple months.  And I got lots to look forward to after that. 
[02:58:00]  Good for you.  And what are the other two?  And that's.  I think that's enough for all three, quite frankly.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Good for you, Steve.  Kennedy, I came up with three other ones.  Is that all right?  Sure.  Wow, this is unorthodox.  Yeah.  That would be six.  It's only supposed to be three.  You're only supposed to get three.  No, it's not all right.  I would have told a fat fuck.  No, it's not all right.  Okay?  We got a Lady Gaga song we got to play.  She's giving her the heads up.  Hey, we're going to go a little off books right now, but I got three more.  This is how they get a little crazy. 
[02:58:30]  I understand.  They sensed the bit was going well.  Is that all right?  Sure.  D. Jang.  Of course.  Like on the turntables doing the wiki wiki?  Mm-hmm.  He does wiki wiki?  You've never done the wiki wiki?  Oh, my God.  He does wiki wiki.  He does the wiki wiki.  Wiki wicklin?  What?  No, not.  Oh, it's not done wicklin?  No.  He looks a little old to be doing the wiki wiki.  Well, I'm sure he doesn't do it very well.  You're just bashing him.  I'm sure he doesn't do it well.  I'm sure he's terrible.  Is that all right?  Sure.  D. Jang. 
[02:59:00]  Of course.  Like on the turntables doing the wiki wiki?  Mm-hmm.  I haven't done that in a while.  I was thinking about this the other day.  I'm missing it because it makes me happy.  Right.  Louis Vuitton.  Oh, my God.  Either buying it for my wife or...  Buying it for myself.  Right, right, right.  And then also good morning show ratings.  That's...  Those make me very, very happy.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Fucking fat bitch.  He sounded like the kid from The Grudge. 
[02:59:30]  It's an inhaler.  All right.  Damn.  What else are we supposed to do with this one?  It's pretty funny.  Carson Kennedy on Mix 104.1 in Boston.  That's some shit radio right there.  They are fucking...  That's some shit radio.  Oh, the station's in 13th place.  That's weird.  They're heinous.  That's weird.  They should be a lot higher with that type of material.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty good.  Actually, you know, unfortunately, yes.  They should be.  You'd think they should be.  Like, fucking dummies that listen to that shit. 
[03:00:00]  We gotta take a break, because we got an exclusive interview after the break.  All right, cool.  I gotta pick.  Can't wait.  It was 40 years ago today that...  What's his name?  Ross Gibb, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Ross Gibb.  I know Ross.  Ross Gibb.  Ross Gibb.  We're talking Ross Gibb.  Played Revolution No. 9 backwards.  And...  Wow.  He's gonna talk to us next.  Amazing.  That started the whole what?  Paul is dead theory?  Yeah.  Wow, that's crazy.  And he started the whole thing.  He did it.  By the way, I saw a little bit of House last night.  Most overrated fucking show ever! 
[03:00:30]  All right, can we talk about it after the break?  Yes.  Because I'm gonna pee my pants.  Thank you.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether  we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere,  and it'll mean a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family. 
[03:01:00]  He was a little dog named Snuggles.  But he was most certainly a part of...  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those  transitions, and then you gotta go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddammit, if we can't come out of a slow  record, I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay. 
[03:01:30]  I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo  record every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.  This is the last goddamn time.  I want somebody to use his fucking brain to not come out of a goddamn record that's up-tempo,  and I gotta talk about a fucking dog dying.  Get up right now over me 
[03:02:00]  Got a big interview.  Oh, yeah.  What's the name of this, uh, this zero that's calling our show?  Ha-ha.  Ross Gibb.  Good old Ross Gibb.  We're getting him on the line right now?  Yeah, this guy is, um...  He started the, uh, Paul is Dead Theory.  Yeah.  Crazy. 
[03:02:30]  That's just crazy.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, uh...  Russ.  Hey, uh, who is this?  Uh, this is the call screener.  Are you going to be on the Opie and Anthony show in a couple minutes?  I guess so.  I don't know.  Do you know those guys?  No, I don't know them.  Do they know me?  No, they're moving around a while.  All right, hold on the line.  All right, we're back and, uh, on the line with Russ Gibb. 
[03:03:00]  Russ, how are you?  Well, if you spell my name backwards, it's Big Sur, so be aware.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It certainly is.  I didn't even notice that.  Place in California, Big Sur.  Ah!  Yes, absolutely.  Now, uh, what a very important day, um, this is.  You know, you're about to fifth day to tell me this week.  Something happened with the Beatles or something. 
[03:03:30]  Ah!  Something.  I think, I think you're downplaying a little bit there, Russ.  It's early.  I think he's alive.  Well, uh, I think you're downplaying a little.  You, you pretty much started the giant rumor, the biggest, uh, rumor, I believe, in, in, uh, radio history.  Yeah, I'm the great ghoul.  Yes, yes, you, you killed off.  Uh, unfortunately, I didn't mean that, I don't mean it like that, because that would be a terrible.  We, we only wish the best for Paul McCartney. 
[03:04:00]  Of course.  But, uh, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.  You know, that was what was so funny.  The Big Apple.  Well, after we blew it here in Michigan, and we, we said, you know, play the record backwards.  Yes.  Which was a great benefit to the record companies.  They loved me.  They sent me a free copy of all their records after, uh, after we sold out their warehouse.  Now, Russ, if I could just interrupt you for a moment.  What, what possessed you to, uh, play that record backwards? 
[03:04:30]  Some kid called me.  I mean, I was doing a Sunday.  Uncle Paul.  Oh, it wasn't even your idea.  No, no.  You know, he said, he said, did you hear Paul is dead?  And I said, I hear every rock star is either dead or a dope fiend, you know?  Oh, absolutely.  Wait a minute.  You said some kid called you.  How old was he?  I think he was three.  He was very bright.  Ah.  No, and he, well, who plays records backwards? 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  You guys playing backwards?  No, I wouldn't even know.  How did you do that?  How did you get the turntable to actually go in reverse?  Well, let me take you back into the old days.  Let's do that.  Set the scene for us, Russ.  Well, years ago, we had to queue up records.  We don't have all those buttons you have.  No, no, no.  I remember that from, uh, from the old days.  Absolutely.  From my boss jock days in the 70s.  Wasn't that a job for the colored?  And then all of a sudden you let the machine go and it would go right onto the music. 
[03:05:30]  No way.  Yeah.  We had tape recorders.  So what I did is I spun it by hand backwards.  Oh, good gravy.  Wow.  The song that we used was, uh, number nine.  Boring.  Number nine.  Yes, exactly.  Yes, yes.  Number nine.  And when you play that backwards, and it said very clearly, turn me on, dead man.  Turn me on, dead man.  Boring.  Are you kidding me?  It freaked me out.  It freaked me out.  I bet.  Were you on any hallucinogenic narcotics at the time? 
[03:06:00]  No, but I think I...  It's a joke, of course.  I want to also say to the kids out there, but don't, uh, don't do drugs.  Well, I hope so.  Yes, yes.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That'll screw you up for good.  Yes, yes, absolutely.  After the kid said that, uh, you know, uh, the phone started to light up, and my newscaster  came in and said, what the heck happened?  Because he said, the phones are all jammed.  People started to call.  And evidently, this had been going on, you know, underground for a long time. 
[03:06:30]  People have been talking about it.  So you have nothing to do with this.  I didn't know anything about it, but I get credit.  What has nothing to do with this?  That kid called.  He was from Eastern Michigan.  Strangely enough, three guys...  Let's get the kid on the phone.  Yes.  We're wasting time with this.  ...that called me.  Yeah.  They said that they were the ones that called me, but I don't know which one it was.  Yeah.  But whatever it is, you guys in New York picked it up in the afternoon.  In the morning, in the early evening, early afternoon here, we were playing it, and  then you guys picked it up, and away it went, you know. 
[03:07:00]  And it's still going.  I had the Russian state television here not too long ago.  The Holland or Amsterdam?  Holland, yeah, yeah.  Brazil?  They've all been talking about his Paul's dad.  Well, I called...  And then what happened?  ...who I shared some rooms with when I was in London.  And then what happened?  Back when he was an artist, you know, just a student.  Who's that?  Eric Clapton.  Oh, who's that?  Eric Clapton.  Clapton is God.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Yes, of course.  I don't want to disparage anybody's religion, though, by saying that.  I just mean that figuratively speaking, of course, of course.  You'll probably make it big.  We try not to offend here, Russ.  Yes, yes.  Well, anyway...  So, now, I want to get to the meat and potatoes of this story, Russ.  Meat and potatoes.  Yes, yes, yes.  How did this spread so quickly?  How did this spread so quickly?  The rumor that, my goodness, Paul McCartney had passed on. 
[03:08:00]  Well, it started because, you know, we set it on the air on an underground station.  We were FM, frequency modulated at the time.  Yes, and we were amplitude modulated.  Were you amplitude?  Yes, amplitude.  I had gotten into amplitude modulated radio way back in, wow, had to be early 70s when I had first gotten into radio.  Well, I was in it back when, you know, there was Clear Channel stations and WJR radio. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  And the bottom line is that we had a very small but very intense younger audience in those days.  And they started to call one another on the phone.  They didn't have cell phones, but they had landlines.  No cell phones, but I want to just let the kids know that are listening, Russ.  We didn't have the cell phone back then.  We didn't have the cell phone like you kids have today with your text, twittering, and whatnot. 
[03:09:00]  Well, that's right.  Well, to Twitter, all of a sudden, the phones jammed up here.  Wow.  Coming down to the studio.  Wow.  And we were starting to get calls within probably half an hour.  Oh, my goodness.  Outside of, you know, the metropolitan Detroit area.  Yeah.  Then it was New York and Pittsburgh and California.  And then we even got some calls from Canada.  Good gravy.  People were saying this and playing this and bringing down albums. 
[03:09:30]  And my boss called me, Black Frank Maruca.  And Frank was his name.  Wait, what was his name, sir?  Black Frank Maruca.  Was he an African gentleman?  No, he wasn't.  Then why would you call him Black Frank?  Because he always wore black.  Oh, I got you.  He was like an undertaker.  Ah.  He wore a suit and a tie.  You know, he was one of those guys.  I hear you.  I hear you.  And our programmer called me and said, what's going on down there?  He said, my news people are calling me that all our phones are jammed. 
[03:10:00]  And I told him.  And he said, you mean you're getting that kind of response?  Wow.  He said, keep doing it.  Now, of course, back in those days, if you were getting a big response from your audience,  you would keep doing it.  These days in radio, you know, you get these uptight program directors and management,  and it's just unbelievable.  It really is.  They don't, the second there's any controversy, they just want to stop it and get back to the music. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You know, this was the days where we could actually be ourselves, Russ.  What's going to happen?  Now, listen.  Say a prayer for the Internet, because that's going to save you guys.  How is that, Russ?  Let me tell you.  You know, I taught media for many, many years.  Yeah.  You know, I was one of those with all those degrees.  You know what a Ph.D. stands for?  What does a Ph.D. stand for, Russ?  It becomes funny.  Piled higher and deeper.  Piled higher and deeper.  That's a BS joke. 
[03:11:00]  I don't get it.  As they say.  Well, it's like BS.  Russ, I don't get that one.  The Internet.  Russ, I don't get the Ph.D. joke.  All right, I'm a ghost.  Now, behave yourself.  Yes, yes.  I understand, Russ.  Continue, please.  It's fascinating.  I want to save you, though.  Your job, because a lot of my friends in radio have been laid off.  Yes, I know that a lot of mine, my compatriots in the business, too, have been laid off. 
[03:11:30]  But I'll tell you something.  I just can't get used to the computer, the Internets.  I see the kids using it.  But I just, oh, it just frightens the heck out of me.  Russ, I don't know what to do with it.  Should I start?  Well, you don't have to know.  There have been what they call algorithms.  What?  And they have been running the Internet.  But now it's starting to come back to human things.  I don't know.  Do you know Dick Kernan?  Yeah.  Yes.  Good old Dick Kernan.  Yes.  We go way back.  His son respects Howard School of Broadcasting. 
[03:12:00]  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  And Dick Kernan's son was one of my students.  One of my top students.  Well, I love Dick.  I remember.  Sure.  He has a new video website called Grok, G-R-O-K.  Now, a website.  Grok, G-R-O-K.  What is this?  Because I know about the web, the World Wide Web, the Information Superhighway, I believe.  But what is a website?  G-R-O-K.  That comes from a science novel called Stranger in a Strange Land. 
[03:12:30]  Do you remember that book?  I guess it's a place.  You're sure, Stranger in a Strange Land.  He doesn't know what a website is.  I'm trying to, because I don't go near a computer.  I do all my research and show prep with the newspaper.  And, like I said, computers just scare me.  They frighten me, Russ.  Well, don't be frightened, because if you go to Grok Music, which Grok Moons all know.  How do I get there, sir?  Because I know I click a mouse.  I click something.  What do I do?  You put your finger on the key. 
[03:13:00]  It's done with a finger.  All right.  On the typewriter?  Yeah, just like a typewriter.  All right.  I'm going to help you.  You'll need help.  Please, I do.  I've been told by my grandchildren that I just can't.  They can't get old granddad to get this gosh darn infernal machine to work.  Well, you're not a granddad.  Oh, boy, they get me every time.  Grok.  G-R-O-K.  Yeah.  Music.com.  Yes.  You spell that out.  You go there.  All right.  There's a whole deal on music.  Then I, right. 
[03:13:30]  And they're starting to bring in and hire a lot of young jockeys.  Russ, he can't get it on his computer screen.  He's having a tough time.  It's not popping up.  He's doing something wrong, Russ.  I touched the computer keyboard, and I put in what you said.  But I don't know what comes up here.  It's a video of some sort.  No, that can't be a video.  It must be some kind of porno or something.  It's telling me to click on something that I've won, a contest of some sort. 
[03:14:00]  No, that's not it.  That I've won an iPod.  Wait, I've won an iPod.  Let me click this.  No, don't click that.  Let's see what it does.  No, don't click that, Russ.  No, he doesn't want to do that.  No?  Why?  If I want an iPod, can I please just claim it?  Hey, it's not all about you, Russ.  Sometimes, you know, I don't make too much in the business these days, so I could use a free iPod.  I just want to click this.  Oh, my God.  What's happening?  I'm at a site called Meat Spin.  What is Meat Spin? 
[03:14:30]  I'm at a site called Meat Spin.  It's something spinning.  He's now immortal.  Yes, sir.  Rusty.  So he's living.  Good gosh.  And he's not going away now.  So now...  I mean, if I'm playing some of these songs, you and I...  Paul is...  So now, Paul was dead...  The whole time?  You started that rumor.  Yeah.  But I've got to tell you what freaked me out about...  Where did the walrus fit in?  Wait, five weeks ago... 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  I get a...  It doesn't have anything to do with Steve Carlesi.  I don't know Steve Carlesi.  You don't know Steve Carlesi?  He knows you, Russ.  Hey, did you ever talk to Paul McCartney about this?  Yes.  What'd he say?  Well, it turns out it was somebody that their manager had said was Paul.  It really wasn't Paul.  Oh, so you didn't talk to him?  No, I didn't.  Well, I met him.  Yeah.  I met all the Beatles when they first were Teeny Bop stars.  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  You were in the business back then? 
[03:15:30]  I was a top 40 jock at that time.  Oh, my God.  What a great time that must have been, Russ, to be a top 40 jack and have a band like the  Beatles come to you.  It was great.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Every record was two minutes long and you had to be excited about everything.  About everything.  Oh, tell me about it.  I remember having to spin a song.  It was Pendulum.  Yeah.  And it was by a band called Foundry way back in the 70s. 
[03:16:00]  And they, I got to say, I don't like using this language, but they sucked.  And we had to play that ad nauseum.  And, you know, the pendulum is swinging back the other.  Oh, it was terrible.  Well, you know, it was like Indigar the Navidad.  Oh, right.  Indigar the Navidad.  That was terrible, terrible.  But at least you could take an old dumperoonie when that one was on, right?  That's right.  It was about seven or 11 minutes long.  And we'd play it on underground radio whenever we wanted to go to the can, you know.  Exactly. 
[03:16:30]  And the B-side of that one was, get me two cheeseburgers pronto.  Oh, Russ, you're an adult.  I love it.  Well, listen.  Oh, great.  You guys are doing well.  Do people get you in the homes or is it only in cars?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  They get us in motorhomes, Russ.  That's kind of cool.  I think it would be fun, you know, being in bed with you driving along the highway.  I guess it would be fun. 
[03:17:00]  Yes, yes.  Where did you get the name Obie?  Obie?  Where did you get the name?  Why don't you tell Russ where you got the name Obie?  Well, honestly, when I was young, I kind of looked like Ron Howard.  And there was a guy in the neighborhood who was a pederast, and he would brutally molest me and call me Opie.  Opie?  Yeah.  So thanks for bringing it up.  You get along with that new guy that Obama put in for his safe schools.  Oh, ho, ho, that guy. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  Who, Ted?  What do you think of Obama?  Yes, that was his name, Ted Schickler.  They call him Abomination.  Do you like...  Oh, you don't like the Obama...  Oh, no.  Who would, right?  Look, I like guys that do things.  Hey, Russ, you don't have to explain it to me.  I was in broadcasting when there were two separate bathrooms, if you know what I mean, and fountains.  And I would go back to those days in, oh, my God, a New York Minute, as they say. 
[03:18:00]  The problem is you can't...  Whites only, my friend, right, Russ?  You cannot judge groups of people by individuals.  There are good and bad people in every group that I know.  Yeah, but some groups have more bad than others, right?  Gus, you know what I'm talking about.  You know what I'm talking about, Russ, right?  What?  I didn't hear you.  I'm busy talking.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  You know, I tend to run away with myself when I get off on a racist rant.  I was having coffee. 
[03:18:30]  I'm on my third cup.  I'm getting high on caffeine.  Oh, good gravy.  You are quite the card, Russ, let me tell you.  We called you because this is the anniversary of the Paul is Dead rumor, and apparently somebody else started it, and you took credit for it.  And how about in 1980 when you started the John is Dead rumor?  What?  I didn't hear you.  Sorry.  What about when you started the George has a hat full of pudding rumor?  Did you have that rumor? 
[03:19:00]  That George's hat was full of pudding.  Remember that rumor you started?  I remember that one.  Oh.  Save the ships.  I remember that one.  Remember that one?  And don't have any secrets during the war.  I mean, you know.  Do we have any other rumors that Russ started?  Yes.  Paul's new wife falls over.  I want you guys to go to the Internet, because that's going to be your salvation.  Hey, did you think Paul's ex-wife had a leg to stand on when she divorced him and got all that money?  Oh, that's a tough joke. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, good gosh.  Come on, Russ.  Sometimes we let loose here on the program.  In New York.  Yeah, we're in New York.  We can let loose a little bit.  Where are you, Russ?  Where are you based out of?  Well, right now I'm in Dearborn, Michigan.  Dearborn, Michigan.  Yeah, the home of the Ford Motor Company.  Yeah, well, it used to be, right?  Well, no.  Wow.  The new Ford, believe it or not, the new Ford Taurus is selling better in California than the Japanese.  You are kidding me. 
[03:20:00]  Better than the Jap models?  I just talked to Big Shot yesterday.  I tell you, you ought to blast them back into the Stone Age like we did during WWII.  What was that, WWII?  World War II?  Yeah, what do you think it was, Russ?  Well, I don't know.  Well, you know, as a senior citizen, I was confused easily.  How many were there?  I don't know.  Two.  It seems we've always been in a war since I can remember.  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah, but I was trying to tell you, one of my partners is an Arab Muslim guy.  A partner?  Oh, so you're a gay man. 
[03:20:30]  You have a partner?  He's a Muslim, and he's a partner of mine.  He's in business.  You mean, oh, I thought you meant a romantic partner.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were of the gay persuasion.  I thought you were of the gay persuasion when you said partner.  Partner?  And then when you said he was Muslim, I thought you liked big, unclipped cock.  What?  I thought you liked giant, brown, unclipped cock, Russ.  It was a woman.  Because you said a partner that was a Muslim.  So I thought you liked unwrapping a turban. 
[03:21:00]  In other words, pulling down the foreskin.  He's an American.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So you're like American men.  Yes, I'm sorry about that.  I'm sorry.  I was all mixed up.  I'm going to call Jim Dunbar and talk to him about you.  What?  Who?  You don't know Jim Dunbar, KGO Radio?  Jim Dunbar?  Yeah.  No, but we have Eric Dumbbell that works here.  Oh, good gravy.  Oh, you've got some sense of humor, you adult. 
[03:21:30]  Let's hear more about the cock.  Yes.  So a married man are you, Mr. Gibb?  Yes, yes.  Oh, are you?  How long?  How long have you been happily married?  30.  30?  They allow that in Michigan?  Oh.  They allow it, yes.  Even with Jennifer Granholm, our new mayor, our governor.  Ah, yes, the new governor over there, right?  Well, she's not new, but she knows how to spend.  Hey, you on the air these days?  Still, you know, talking on the radio?  Yeah, well, I'm on the air with people like you.  They call me all the time when I'm having breakfast. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I am sorry if we interrupted your breakfast.  What are you having, cum?  I was finished.  Hey, you didn't interrupt.  You're okay.  All right.  You sound like you're a bunch of...  Tell me about yourself.  I'm interested.  Anthony, where's Anthony?  Well, this is Anthony, Russ.  I like to say I'm 63 years young.  I'm the father of three.  I'm the grandfather of eight.  My goodness. 
[03:22:30]  And, yeah, and I've been in radio.  It's been a passion of mine ever since I graduated from Geneseo back when I was 17.  You're kidding.  That's about my story, too.  And I got into...  Well, you asked me about me, Russ, so don't bring up you, okay, for a second?  Thank you.  So I got into broadcasting, and I made my bones, too.  I actually came up with the rumor that John Bonham was dead, but it was after he actually 
[03:23:00]  died, so nobody took it seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  So how many grandchildren do you have?  Eight.  I told you once.  What are you, like CSI?  You're trying to trip me up, right?  Children are God's gift until they're about 14.  Go tell me about it.  You're not kidding me.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  They are.  And then they really become God's gift after 14 and start bringing their friends home.  You know what I mean?  They turn on you.  They make up lies.  Go down into the rec room, and you wonder why they're all quiet all of a sudden. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Got to show them a movie.  I know that.  Yep.  After that, there were two words I didn't want to hear.  Rape kit.  If you know what I mean.  Right, Russ?  Jimmy Carlisle.  Oh, gosh.  What's that?  Jimmy Carlisle?  Danny Carlisle.  Danny Carlisle?  Dan Carlisle.  Yeah, we got him here.  Why?  You want to talk to him?  Does he work for you?  Yeah, he's over here at the Sirius XM satellite thing.  I thought he was.  Yeah, he's on rock music. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He writes for them or something.  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I have no idea.  I like the satellite idea, though, that you can hear on the radio.  That you can put something in space and orbit the Earth?  Yeah, it is a good idea.  And, well, whenever you want to put it in space.  Of course, you guys have been in space for a long time.  Oh, good gosh.  Good gosh.  And maybe we haven't been arrested yet.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Are you familiar with the careers of Opie and Anthony? 
[03:24:30]  No, I'm not.  I'm sorry to say I'm a little ignorant.  Oh.  A lot ignorant.  Well, we got together back in the 70s.  We were both boss jocks working out of Los Angeles and decided to hook up together.  I had my original partner, who he was also named Opie, but he passed on.  So I just franchised the name, get another one, Dime a Dozen, you know what I mean, as far as just getting a name. 
[03:25:00]  Yes, you can there, Dime a Dozen.  But we became very, very close, if you know what I mean.  Like, very, very close.  This was before I was experimenting, and I'm a widow now.  Okay.  And I kind of changed my preferences, if you know what I mean, Russ.  Yes.  What kind of guy are you?  I'm an old, old guy.  You're tall.  You're handsome.  Consider yourself...  If anybody needs back surgery, it's a laser. 
[03:25:30]  Ah, yeah.  It didn't stand.  I mean, how heavy are those loads that your back would hurt?  Stop it.  Oh, come on now, Russ.  I'm one day.  You're a handsome man, are you?  Russ, would you consider yourself handsome?  That's my secretary.  Am I handsome, sweetheart?  What do you say?  Ugly.  Me and you?  What do you think?  A little experimentation?  I did.  Are you curious?  Are you bi-curious?  No, I'm not bi-curious.  No?  Because I would love it if you were a little bi-curious. 
[03:26:00]  No, you could do some bi-curious things.  You have a fetish, I think.  No, it's not a fetish.  I'm a flaming homosexual.  Oh, one of those.  Yeah, yeah.  Have been for ever since the old ball and chain passed on.  I just can't get enough cock, Russ.  Russ, and I love, you know what is heaven for me?  You know how you felt when you made the rumor that Paul was dead and you had that self, that feeling of satisfaction?  When I'm tonguing another man's asshole, I feel like that, Russ. 
[03:26:30]  Well, I think you ought to be ashamed of it.  That's the feeling I get.  Ashamed?  Hey, don't knock it until you've tried it, and if you want to try it, here's my number.  Ha, ha, ha, hello, Russ.  Oh, my secretary wanted to know if you were hitting on me.  Well, I got to say, go hit somewhere else.  Oh, no, come on, Russ.  I'm a good egg.  Yeah, you know, you're all right.  You know, somebody will help you someday.  That's all right.  Hey, I saw you on Lemon Party.  You looked great.  Hey, what is that? 
[03:27:00]  Ah, it's a little thing I saw on the intertubes.  It's fantastic, fantastic.  I'm going to be flying into Michigan pretty soon if you want to hook up.  No, no thanks.  What do you say?  Me, you, Russ, come on.  No, we will pass.  Yeah?  Hey, mind you.  What's the matter?  You're a dick like Paul these days?  No.  Rumored to be dead?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm kidding.  Little Viagra will fix that up.  We'll be sweating.  We'll do poppers.  I'll fuck you.  You fuck me. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, my goodness.  What do you say, Russ?  Oh, goodness gracious.  Exactly.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Passat is in the dugout.  I'm glad you guys are...  Pettit New.  What?  Are you down in the village?  Yes, yes.  I live down in the village here in Manhattan, yeah.  You enjoy yourself down there.  Oh, I have a little dog.  We take him walking every day out on the bicycle path with my little shorts.  You don't have a problem with homosexuality, do you, Russ?  With what?  You don't have a problem with homosexuality, do you, Russ? 
[03:28:00]  I don't care what you do in the privacy of your home.  That's your business.  But that's just it.  I don't like it in the privacy of my own home.  I like it in dumpsters.  I like it...  You like it on the air.  I like it outside.  I like it against a car in the middle of the night.  I'm one of those that likes giving fellatio behind in back alleys.  It's the shock jock.  Oh, shock jock.  You know, I don't like that label.  Howard Stern? 
[03:28:30]  No, we have a phone call.  We have a phone call coming in.  All right.  Let's go to Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul is a good caller.  You're on with Russ Gibb.  Russ Gibb.  Start the rumor.  Paul is dead.  Paul is dead.  Yeah.  Hello.  Is this Russ Gibb?  Whoa.  How are you?  Whoa.  I remember that rumor.  I was teaching third graders at the time, and they all come in, and they said,  Mr. Hargis, what happened to Paul McCartney? 
[03:29:00]  This is one of their voices.  What?  I couldn't hear you.  I couldn't hear you.  No.  I was teaching third graders at the time, and they was all coming in going, Mr. Hargis,  what happened with Paul McCartney?  I had to take them in the other room and search them for stolen toys. 
[03:29:30]  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So you're into toys.  No, but I got very fond memories.  It was just back in those days, it was so easy to start a rumor.  What rumor?  Like when they would say things about me, like that I was doing things.  Whatever you're doing, I hope they're giving you a salary for it. 
[03:30:00]  They would make up lies about me.  Like if I thought that they were stealing candy, I would.  Whatever you're up to.  What would you do, Paul?  What would you do when you thought they were stealing candy, Paul?  I'd have to take them in the other room and search them.  I'd have to find all the places that a youngster could hide candy,  and I'd get in there and I'd look real good.  But they'd always say I was doing other things. 
[03:30:30]  That's terrible.  I hope that you do okay on those things.  Huh?  Yeah.  So the rumor is that you're dead.  Huh?  You're dead.  Yeah, that rumor was really all the kids was crying.  Yeah.  What do you think of these guys?  I think they need to go to a retirement home.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Who's that talking in the background?  Tell her to shut up. 
[03:31:00]  He's even got a hole on the phone.  Well, I still never got about Anthony, though.  Who's that talking in the background during my phone call?  Tell her to shut up.  Now, now, Uncle Paul, be nice to our guest, Russ Gibb.  I don't like nobody talking while I'm on the phone.  Russ Gibb, who started the rumor that Paul McCartney was indeed dead back in a...  What year was that?  Who's that lady back there?  What year was that, Russ?  Who's that lady?  Seriously, let's go back to that topic. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, shut up.  Yes, yes.  Tell the guy to shut up.  I think we ought to go back to that topic, Uncle Paul.  All right, goddamn lady.  Five weeks ago...  Not to talk while I'm talking, you know.  ...from somebody, and he sends me a photograph of Paul and his stubble on the boat going around Manhattan Island.  That they're on a boat.  Yes.  Both look like Paul McCartney.  I couldn't tell him.  Don't tell me I should have to go to the retirement home.  Tell her to shut up. 
[03:32:00]  Uncle Paul's getting very sensitive.  Yeah, he's very sensitive.  I'm 57 years young.  I hope things in Los Angeles are better for you, or New York are better for you.  They are.  And Paul is alive and well, and he's become immortal now.  If you start playing records backwards, nobody's going to buy him because they can get him free on the internet.  Plus, they're CDs.  Please.  Exactly.  Correct him.  I like...  I heard that lady stop talking.  I hated her. 
[03:32:30]  I like vinyl, Russ, to tell you the truth.  I still spin vinyl.  Do you?  Yeah, no one does that anymore, you know.  It's just got that natural sound.  Analog sound is better than digital.  It absolutely is.  That's why I like it, and I play it on a Victrola.  Oh, well, that's great.  Oh, I like taking it way back.  You know, one time, one time I was, I had to, I saw one of the kids took a Heishi kiss, so I had to do a bunch of checking back there, if you know what I mean. 
[03:33:00]  Yes, Uncle Paul.  What does this have to do with Paul is dead and talking to Russ Gibb?  It reminded me of something when that stupid lady started talking.  Well, she's not stupid.  She's very bright, and we like her a great deal.  Well, who is she?  I don't mean no disrespect, but who is she?  She embarrassed me. 
[03:33:30]  Well, she did that perfectly.  I'm not a child molester.  I don't touch them.  They're just so cute to look at at that age.  You better go to Washington.  That's where you belong.  Huh?  My goodness.  You better go to Washington.  That's where you belong.  Now, listen.  I want you to look at grokmusic.com.  Yes, grokmusic.com.  What is a .com?  Yes, yes.  And Paul is alive.  You don't have to worry about that.  Oh, he is.  And you'll have fun looking around in the things, and it is the anniversary. 
[03:34:00]  So we should all be very thankful for that.  Yes, absolutely.  Have you ever been in the middle of a phone call you don't know how to get out of?  Yes.  Where?  Yes, Uncle Paul.  Well, you behave yourself.  It's time for me to go, as it is not for them to take me away.  Oh, Russ, Russ.  No, no, no, no.  You'll be your OB or whatever.  Well, whatever.  It really doesn't matter.  But, Russ, I'm going to be in your neck of the woods sometimes, 
[03:34:30]  and I would like to actually get together and maybe chat a little bit about this Paul McCartney thing  and maybe just kind of jiggle your balls around a little in my hand, my mouth, whatever.  Me and you get together.  You are a nasty boy.  Anyway, behave yourself.  Bring that secretary of yours.  She can watch.  Masturbate with a pickaxe.  Oh, you are terrible.  You're terrible.  Yes, terrible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's me, Russ.  Hey, Russ Gibb, everybody.  Let's go back. 
[03:35:00]  Thank you, Russ.  Russ?  All right.  I like that.  That lighty.  I like when Jimmy just starts laughing at his lines.  He's like, hey, take candy.  Got to try to recover. 
[03:35:30]  Ah, shit.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  That was fun.  We had a good time with old Russ Gibb.  Yeah.  Good job, man.  That's a lot of fun.  We're going to play out with Andy Rooney, his weekly beat at the Blue Room.  Nice.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Good evening, cool cats.  The Blue Room would like to welcome back Mr. Andy Rooney and his weekly beat.  Today's Cool Riff, Vacation. 
[03:36:00]  You ever notice when you come back to a hotel and you forgot to check out, your stuff's thrown all over the front lawn?  You ever have that happen?  And it's embarrassing stuff, like black dildos and men's magazines with all men in them.  You ever have that happen?  Your ear hose is spilled all over your luggage.  You ever notice when your flight to Somalia is delayed, your vacation starts late?  You ever watch a clitoral circumcision on the beach? 
[03:36:30]  My idea of relaxing is to watch some red tube and see a girl pink sock while a large gentleman dog fucks her.  You ever see a girl pink sock and then he pushes it back in?  That's fun.  When I was a kid, booyah was something you yelled at a rival baseball player.  Now it's something you yell when your testicles are in the hiney of a runaway.  Don't you hate when you want to go on vacation and your family points you to a cemetery and they say,  Go ahead, Pop, sleep by this headstone. 
[03:37:00]  You ever notice how embarrassing that is?  Give it up for Mr. Andy Rooney, ladies and gentlemen.  Y'all come back next week for more of Mr. Andy Rooney.  You ever notice that diapers never fit the way they're supposed to when you're an adult?  Provided he don't shit himself again. </pre>
