<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual vulgar banter, targeting their staff, Ben and Steve.  The conversation quickly transitioned to the riots in France, with Opie expressing disdain and blaming the Muslim population.  This led to a discussion of the New Jersey gubernatorial race between Corzine and Forrester, marked by negative campaigning and voter apathy.  The conversation then shifted to the New York City mayoral election, veering into racially charged jokes and stereotypes regarding the possibility of a Black or Jewish president, exploring perceived societal prejudices and race relations, particularly within the Black community.  The smoking ban in New York City bars and restaurants was debated, with tangents on child obesity and parental responsibility.  The upcoming San Francisco show and the negative campaigning in the New Jersey governor's race were briefly revisited.  A significant portion was dedicated to Zoe Kaplowicz, a woman with MS who consistently finishes last in the NYC Marathon.  The hosts questioned her motivations, suggesting attention-seeking behavior, before acknowledging her resilience.  The show teased an upcoming interview with the Hanson brothers.

The next segment began with a caller, Paul (with MS and poor audio quality).  This segued into criticism of a Fox 5 news report on the XM MiFi device. Opie's strep throat and his Zithromax treatment sparked a discussion of Rich Vos's dental problems and a potential link to drug use, challenged by a caller, "Inbred."  Howard Stern's supposed suspension was dismissed as a publicity stunt, and the hosts criticized lazy news reporting, referencing inaccurate reporting about their own show, including a Rolling Stone ad.  They discussed an upcoming photoshoot and Opie recounted an exploitative modeling experience.  A Fox 5 report on sauerkraut's potential to fight bird flu led to a call from a college professor, Matt, explaining the scientific basis (malic acid).  Further calls addressed bird flu remedies and the absurdity of news reporting.  Opie shared Thanksgiving plans and childhood anecdotes about margarine sandwiches, wool blankets, and sunburns.  The segment concluded with calls about pubic hair shaving, STDs, Opie's hygiene (or lack thereof), and more childhood stories, ending with Opie's worsening strep throat.

The following segment started with Opie detailing his illness and potential illegal acquisition of penicillin.  The hosts discussed the perceived uselessness of radio reports in newspapers, contrasting them with bridge columns and Gridlock Sam.  Opie discussed his restaurant venture with his ill brother, whose illness Opie seemed to have caught.  The premature arrival of Christmas decorations and music led to a discussion of a news report about the Capitol Christmas tree and a newscaster's awkward ad-libbing. Howard Stern's (again) alleged suspension (a publicity stunt) and Opie's past suspensions were mentioned.  Phone calls followed: one about car repair (Opie needing a car door), and another about seeing their billboard.  A segment on teenage virginity pledges escalated into vulgar conversations about sex and virginity. More calls about car problems and attempts to get Opie a Cadillac door ensued, followed by speculation about a mysterious meeting.  A biographical anecdote about a deceased actor's alcoholism, depression, and suicide was read.  A Fox News car chase was shown, followed by a discussion of Tyra Banks' "fat suit" and reactions to overweight people.  Listener calls about the fat suit and online IQ tests concluded the segment, with Opie needing to leave for the restroom due to his illness.

A guest, Dee Dee, discussed her Hashimoto's disease, engaging in vulgar banter with the hosts about its symptoms and treatment (Lavoxel).  Eric provided a factual explanation.  Audio clips and discussion of a Tyra Banks special on weight and body image dominated a significant portion. Dee Dee shared her experiences with weight discrimination as a Black woman.  The hosts made crude, racist, and sexist jokes.  A caller, Rob, highlighted the irony of Tyra Banks' advocacy.  A guest recounted a negative airplane experience due to her weight, leading to more offensive jokes.  An overweight caller shared her experiences, followed by a call-in segment for overweight women.  A musical guest, Mark Tite, performed a song about a large woman hindering romantic advances.  The show ended with more discussion of Dee Dee's Hashimoto's and weight loss.

The final segment began with Anthony recounting a bizarre story involving a car accident, a naked girl, and a Howie Mandel impersonator.  A "Best Of" show was announced, with listeners voting on their favorite segments (including Ramon promos) on OpieandAnthony.com.  A Ramon promo was critiqued.  A call from Michelle, a large woman from Colorado, discussed her dating life and weight.  Sexually explicit and offensive jokes followed.  More calls from large women participated in similar banter.  A "fat girl eating contest" was proposed.  Rich Vos was a guest throughout.  The show ended with promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is a despicable ass hat.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And ask if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration. 
[00:04:30]  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration through out of which will come exaglomerated the latter  mongrel past the people.  All of races will be destroyed and sick of all.  I'm the one.  Honor and God will die before I yield one end.  That time is a good time.  What about that? 
[00:05:00]  Hey, what happened to mine?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  Well, no shit.  Sounds a little low today, doesn't it?  Sounds low.  What's going on?  Let me try this one.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  A little better, but...  He was the greatest beast of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  It's definitely low, Anthony, because they usually have you right about there where  the arrow is.  That's interesting.  And now you're way up here. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, well.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  France is on fire.  I love it.  And it's election day.  See some of the funny headlines?  French toast.  It said French toast, and they were showing the fires.  Where did you see that one?  I think it's in the Post somewhere.  Oh.  Yeah.  There's one of our bits for today.  French toast.  Headlines from your newspapers.  Yeah.  What are they saying about France burning?  I love it.  I just love when a pompous, stupid-ass country just starts crumbling from the inside. 
[00:06:00]  They've allowed all of these Muslims to come into their country without any kind of real  regulation.  They're such a racist country, but they're so afraid that the rest of the world will see  that they're racist.  So they just let people pretty much do what they want.  And these Muslims now are going crazy.  It's been going on for, what, almost two weeks? 
[00:06:30]  Like 12 days or something?  Yeah, about two weeks.  Two weeks now.  And they just can't get their shit under control over there because they're a bunch of French  faggots who don't know how to take their terrorists by the balls.  They have a curfew, too, at nine.  You think when they're, like, smashing windows and burning buildings and cars, you're going,  oh, shit, it's nine o'clock.  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, Jesus.  We better wrap this up and we'll start up again tomorrow.  Oh, Allah.  Better get inside.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  Quick.  Curfew.  A curfew at nine.  If you just go out with rubber bullets or something. 
[00:07:00]  A curfew.  Is that what they told the Nazis?  Hey, there's a curfew.  There's a curfew in this country, buster.  You don't rip out gold teeth past 10 p.m.  Jesus.  Horrid.  And then there was a little confusion because I said, is today election day?  Are we going to figure out this Corzine Forrester thing today, finally?  Yeah, tonight.  By the way, we don't really care who is the governor of New Jersey.  Quite frankly, I don't know which guy does. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  I've seen the debates, I've seen the commercials, but I don't know anything about either candidate.  No.  And I don't think they want you to know anything about either candidate.  No, they've been bashing each other now since the battle started between the two.  It's just been them bashing each other on a personal level.  And then the last day, for like one day, they've started to come out and say what they're for.  Yeah.  What their platform is.  But I don't think anyone really cares. 
[00:08:00]  It looks like Corzine's going to win.  Forrester's kind of behind.  He's fading, right?  But he's within reach, unlike Ferrer running for mayor here in New York against Bloomberg.  There's like a 35-point swing or something.  Bloomberg's actually been going around telling people to vote because he's afraid everyone's just going to go,  it's such a blowout, I don't even have to go down there and vote today.  Can you imagine?  So he's been out there scared shitless going, no people, please, you know, don't take this for granted.  Get out there and vote.  All the people supporting him are looking at the paper going, ah, it's going to be a blowout. 
[00:08:30]  Let's go to the movies instead.  Your new mayor.  Yeah.  Ah.  No.  Who would have thought that a Jew would be running against a Puerto Rican ever in this country for anything?  Only in New York, though.  But if he wins the Puerto Rican, you know, like, Gracie Manchin is going to be all boarded up and graffiti on and stuff.  There's going to be like 300 people living in it.  A little fact about that.  The mayor doesn't live there.  In Gracie Manchin?  For, like, either the first time or one of the first times ever. 
[00:09:00]  What, Bloomberg doesn't live there, right?  No.  No, it's a step down for him.  Yeah, it's the mayor's residence, and he opt out on it, said, fuck no, man, my place is much better than that piece of shit.  Remember when Sharpton ran for president?  The only way he was making it on the White House lawn was with a lantern in his hand.  I need rimshots for you today, Voss.  That was a good one.  I'm starting off strong.  Rimshot Voss today.  Yeah, we're going to call you Rimshot Voss.  Who do you think will be a president first?  A Jew, a black man, or a lady? 
[00:09:30]  Of the United States?  Yeah.  It's got to be a lady, right?  Let me see.  I think more so than the American public having to vote for the three choices you gave,  I think it's more that who will be put up there by the politicians first.  I think they figured a woman would be more accepted.  It'll be a woman before a black. 
[00:10:00]  It'll be easier for the American people to vote for a woman.  Not that they would want a woman in there any more than they would a guy.  I think this country at this point kind of just wants to stick to leaving the guys in there.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think we want a woman at such a high place of power right now.  It's just the way it is.  It's worked out well so far.  I can't tell you why or anything.  It's because it worked out well so far.  People don't like changing the rock and the apple cart.  You don't want to do that.  Not yet.  Shake shit up too much.  But a black guy?  I don't know. 
[00:10:30]  Definitely before a Jew.  A black guy before a Jew.  You think black guy before a Jew?  Well, because one, there's only 3% Jews in this country who vote.  3% all across the world.  There's 13% black people in this country.  So right there's 10% more.  Then, on any white supremacy list, the Jews are number one, you know, on the white.  Which was tough.  We were number three at one point, but we had to foreclose on farms and work our way up.  So the hatred towards them outweighs the hatred towards blacks. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  I think the prejudice, though, in the majority, you might get the hardcore, like, racists,  or like you're talking about, the white supremacists, with their little hit list thinking that the Jews are on top.  But as far as the general population of this country goes, I believe you'd have an easier time getting a moderate Jewish guy in there  before you would any black guy.  You know, I never looked at it that way.  The overall aspect, the blacks are still...  Yeah, I think as far as being accepted to the presidency, you know, you would get... 
[00:11:30]  You can't have, like, you know, Shlomo Meyervitz running for president.  You know, I don't think he's going to be on the ticket anytime soon.  Or Rasheem Ramallah.  Right, right, right, exactly.  I think a light...  But you go with a light-skinned black.  Like Colin Powell, before he self-destructed with the whole Bush thing, going before the U.N. against Iraq,  like, before that whole scandal, I think he was setting himself up pretty well to be accepted by the people 
[00:12:00]  where he probably could have gotten a vice presidential ticket and then maybe run it after a two-term stint  by whoever was his president.  Something like that.  Get people used to it.  But he blew that.  He's completely blown out of the water as far as politics goes.  Now, I don't think that Obama guy...  He's got...  No.  He's got the best shot, though.  His name sounds too much like Osama.  He's going to have to change that. 
[00:12:30]  He's just running.  No, it doesn't matter.  Human people...  The friggin' American people...  I look at it like that.  But here's this.  Obama sounds like Osama.  That's fine, but name another black guy that you even know that has a shot at the White House besides him.  None.  Exactly.  None.  And he doesn't either.  It would have to be a light-skinned black.  I mean, if you're like Mickey Rivers black or Bruce Smith black or Manute Bull black, you don't have a shot, man.  And it'll never be like the movies, like a Chris Rock movie or something where it's like,  I'm the president! 
[00:13:00]  You know, it's going to be like these guys that you see.  I like when they interview black people that are in the Air Force.  Because that's the only...  Like a black guy fighter pilot.  It's never like in the movies, damn, I hit that shit up good!  Yeah, launch the missile, motherfucker!  The guy's like, we were cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet.  Very well-spoken.  It's never some jive-talking motherfucker.  You know?  It's a Cuban gooding.  That's what you're going to get. 
[00:13:30]  Well, no, not really.  Cuban's a little too black.  He's too black.  He's got a little too much going on there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like you say, you're not going to get Manute, like the nightlight black, where, you know,  you stand in front of a brick wall and you look like an alley black.  You know what I'm talking about?  No.  But it's funny that the black people, any light-skinned black or Republican black, to  the average or majority of black people, is considered an Uncle Tom.  Right.  They will not get the black vote.  Not at all.  Because they're Uncle Toms, but yet they're shooting themselves in the foot because the 
[00:14:00]  liberal blacks are holding their own people down by affirmative action and housing.  This keeps them out of the neighborhood of the superior white race and keeps them down.  You know what I'm saying.  There's always been a problem within the black community getting a power base going because  they themselves are divided.  They can't get together as one and be united under some kind of leadership.  It just doesn't work for some reason. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  There was something that happened just last week.  I don't know the names, but it was a conservative Republican black guy, and he was being pelted  by liberal Democrat blacks with Oreo cookies.  They came in throwing Oreos at him and calling him an Uncle Tom just because he's successful.  He's like working himself up in the Republican Party.  And blacks look at the Republicans like a bunch of white cowboy hat-wearing racists. 
[00:15:00]  So if you're a black guy in there, you're the Uncle Tom, the token, and until they reach  some kind of a happy medium there, it's going to be very hard for them.  And the sad thing is the Oreo cookies that they were throwing, basically the white man  paid for that through tax dollars that went to Wix-decks or food stamps.  You think that's what they didn't pay for the Oreos?  They got them with their paper money, and they take it and they waste it.  All right.  But just before we went on the air, Ben's like, yeah, you know, it's election day, and because 
[00:15:30]  of our hours, it's great.  You know, right after the show, I'm going to go vote.  Yeah.  And then I'm like, vote?  Ugh.  Voting?  And then he goes, if you don't vote, you can't what?  Complain?  Yeah.  He said, unless you vote, then you can't complain.  You shouldn't complain.  And a lot of people say that.  A lot of people say you shouldn't complain if you don't vote.  Don't complain if you don't vote.  But I make a statement by not voting.  Like, I didn't want Bush or Kerry in the last election. 
[00:16:00]  No.  I was leaning toward Kerry, but I saw through that bullshit.  I did the phone calls before they come in.  Oh, but you should have voted Libertarian then.  Right.  Yeah.  In other words, don't vote.  What was I supposed to do?  If I didn't like Bush or Kerry.  We'll take the main election there.  Vote Libertarian.  You should have voted for the Green Party.  You should have voted.  In other words, throw the vote away.  Shut up.  Unless you're voting Democrat or Republican, you're throwing your vote away. 
[00:16:30]  Sorry.  Just the way it is.  And, yeah, if you don't want either one, what are you supposed to do?  No vote?  You vote in your no vote?  That's what I do.  That's my protest.  I don't vote.  Don't vote.  When I don't like the candidates.  Because it does make a statement when they say only such and such percentage of the people  even voted this election.  It kind of lets the people know that, hey, even though you won, Pally, really people don't  like you.  Yeah, we're not that happy.  A lot of the people of this country really don't like you. 
[00:17:00]  How about we're voting for mayor today, right?  Yeah.  Nah.  I don't care.  You live in the city, though.  I don't care.  How can you not care?  I've, I've, I've, things haven't changed that much since Giuliani, so what has Bloomberg  really done?  Bloomberg's done a lot.  Bloomberg's done a great job.  Bloomberg has really done a lot.  Bloomberg is...  What has he done for me, Anthony?  He has made an extension of what Giuliani did.  He kind of, like, took up the reins and kept things going as far as quality of life  goes in the city.  A lot of quality of life things.  Uh, smoking in the, in the bars, um... 
[00:17:30]  Horrible.  You, you, I was completely against that at first.  Even as a non-smoker, I was against that.  I don't like people's, you know, right or whatever being stepped on.  But when you go home, and maybe not you, because you still smoke.  When you go home and get undressed, and the pile of clothes you put on the floor doesn't  smell like a fucking campfire in the morning.  That's great news.  When you pack your luggage and then come back home and open it up, and it's not just an  ashtray.  That's great news for me, because I could, uh, re-wear my clothes.  Yeah, but see, the thing, free business and capitalism, it just infringes on that. 
[00:18:00]  Free business and capitalism.  You open a bar, all right, and you're depending on those customers, and all of a sudden the  government comes in and says, hey, they can't do this in your bar, which is, goes hand-in-hand  smoking and drinking.  I completely agree with Rich Voss, and I hate smokers.  You know, I mean, this is...  That's like, you know, it's rank, it's like rank control, too.  It's bullshit.  If you're a landlord or a homeowner, it's free business trade.  I can't believe I'm this fucking smart. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, don't worry.  You'll fuck it up soon.  Yeah, believe me.  We're waiting for you to fall off the cliff.  So, you know, you gotta put...  You're just putting yourself as the common non-smoker or smoker, but you gotta go and  look at these guys that are investing all this cash.  I kind of, uh...  Ah, there you go.  The XM MyFi on Fox 5.  Get that story for us, all right?  The XM MyFi.  Very good.  Tech gadgets.  Doing a little tech talk.  Uh, no, I agree with the smoking in the restaurants and the bars, by the way.  Completely agree.  I think...  I can't believe you could tell a bar owner or a restaurant owner, you know, that people 
[00:19:00]  aren't allowed to smoke.  Something that is legal in our society.  Let me tell you something.  I know it's legal.  But, uh, it, it, it just is harmful.  It is very harmful.  Well, then...  It's working in an environment...  And ban smoking altogether.  They give them the illegal substance.  Well, if it's a legal substance and you own a restaurant or a bar, you should, you...  That, it should be up to you.  But...  Your workers then decide, well, do I want to work in this environment?  No, I don't want to work in this environment.  So then you find another job that's in a smoke-free environment. 
[00:19:30]  The alcohol is not a dangerous substance that they're serving?  And if I go in, in the old days, if a bar was too smoky, I'm out of there.  And I would find a place that might not be as, uh, as smoky.  Sometimes you couldn't be out of there.  Working in our business, we did a lot of bar gigs.  Very hard.  The 12 places in Manhattan that you can still legally smoke do a killer business.  You can't even get into them on the weekends.  The places that you can legally smoke.  How about this?  How about they took the smoking thing here in New York a step further, and these cigar  bars are closing down.  Cigar bars are places where people go out of their way to smoke their cigars. 
[00:20:00]  And the employees know what kind of atmosphere they're working in.  It's not like a restaurant where they're serving food, and you're like, hey, I don't want smoke.  But how does that make sense?  The cigarette thing?  I understand we can debate this for hours.  But they were closing down the cigar bars.  Well, and to go back to that, a lot of those cigar bars do serve food still.  And you can smoke.  I know of several of them that you can, which is even, you know...  But there was one we used to go to, not that we smoked cigars, but we would, you know, stop  there once in a while in 56.  And all of a sudden, they're like, ah, we got to close down because we're not allowed 
[00:20:30]  to let people smoke cigars in here anymore, even though the place opened up as a place  to smoke cigars.  It's the biggest scam.  The government, you know, they sue the tobacco companies for billions of dollars.  They do all this bullshit, yet they'll fund the farmers to grow the tobacco.  They'll make the tax money off the cigarettes.  And then they...  The government aren't the ones that are suing tobacco companies.  Oh, yeah.  Local governments sue tobacco companies all the time for health care.  It's usually the people that are, you know, my grandpa died after smoking and, you know, 
[00:21:00]  now I'm going to sue fucking...  The government loves...  R.J. Reynolds loves the tobacco industry.  Are you insane, Ray?  Yeah, that's why they'll never outlaw...  They absolutely love the tobacco industry.  Yeah, but states have sued tobacco companies.  You know how much money they get from the tobacco industry?  It's all a scam.  It's like you can't...  It's like, say, in OTB, you can't hold one of your nostrils and shoot out the other one.  You know, or spit...  I mean, there's certain things you do in these places.  And smoking...  We go on the road, and the clubs that you could smoke in are always more crowded than the 
[00:21:30]  ones you can't smoke in.  You don't have a non-smoking show full of fucking jerk-offs.  Well, that's one issue.  I just simplify the argument.  It amazes me that it's a legal substance, and you're telling restaurant and bar owners  that you're not allowed to have that in your establishment.  That just amazes me.  If smoking's that bad, then try to, you know, make it illegal.  Restaurants, though, you can...  The restaurant side of it, you can understand a little bit more.  The bar side.  But not in America, because...  Restaurants are packed.  Yeah, but not in America. 
[00:22:00]  Like, in America, you know, I have the choice.  I will either go to a restaurant that has a lot of smoking, or I will personally, and  have done this in the past, find a restaurant that's not smoking, or, well, I mean, or has  a non-smoking area or an outside area where I don't have to deal with it.  Yeah, but when they first did the law, how they had it was with the rest...  You could have a smoking section in a restaurant, but it had to be...  Oh, that was great.  It was a glass death booth.  It was like the airport every time.  No, it wasn't even that.  All the smokers in the death room.  It wasn't even that. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, they had the smoking sections in the restaurant, and some, you know, comedian said  that's like having a peeing section in a pool.  Like, what does that really do?  I know, because you'd be at one table that's in the non-smoking section, and then it's right  next to the smoking section.  Right, right.  So you're sitting next to a table of smokers.  Wait, there's not a peeing section in the pool?  Oozing over at you.  It's everywhere.  I laugh at the people that, you know, you're in a pool, and all of a sudden they jump out of  the pool, and they're running into the house.  I'm like, where are you going?  Oh, I have to take a leak.  Like, how are you raised? 
[00:23:00]  How about that dye that if you pee in a pool, it turns like a bright blue by the way?  Yeah, that's an urban legend, by the way.  But every time I take a leak in a pool, that goes through my head.  I think it turns the water orange or blue.  No, but it can't turn it blue, Rich.  Jesus.  Or whatever.  I think it was orange.  It's too much government.  It's them saying, you can't do this.  Oh my God, here we go.  No, it's just, they're telling you what you can eat, can eat.  You know, we're not fucking idiots.  What are you talking about?  Who says what we can eat? 
[00:23:30]  How many things?  What aren't you allowed to eat?  Tobacco?  No, no, I'm not saying what you can or can't.  What aren't you allowed to eat?  No, no, no.  They're putting regulations on all kinds of, in these places, you have to have a.  Oh my God, I love this.  Go ahead.  I have to have charts on calories and fat intake, this and that, and they're making places.  That's just there to educate the people.  They're not saying don't eat your big Mac or your Whopper or whatever.  Okay.  You're allowed to eat whatever the fuck you want.  All right, pretty soon.  Uh-oh.  In Voss's America. 
[00:24:00]  Pretty soon, they'll have restrictions on certain, like McDonald's won't be allowed  to sell this type of food with that much fat in it.  And you get your info from where?  It's a theory.  It's, you know, I just see it coming.  Ah, the theory of Voss.  You see it coming.  Watch, you'll see.  Yeah.  Maybe children first.  Maybe they'll start out like, you can't sell a Whopper to a kid under, like, 18.  Well, that's child abuse for kids.  Anyhow, if a parent, if a kid is 300 or 400 pounds and a parent keeps pushing Big Macs 
[00:24:30]  into this kid's face, they wouldn't do it with alcohol or drugs, but they do it with  food just because they're lazy or they're fucking pigs.  And that's child abuse, in my opinion.  Yeah, a bunch of fat kids running around.  Yeah, and it's the parent's fault.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  All right, all right, all right.  You're trying to bring it back around to the election here in New York City and the  voting, and you shouldn't have any say.  And I disagree, by the way.  You guys said that, but Bloomberg did a lot.  I don't think one man does a lot anymore.  There was a time, you know, when I was talking politics with my dad and stuff, it seemed like 
[00:25:00]  one guy used to do a lot in this country.  And I don't think that has been the case for many, many years.  You're right as far as the president goes.  A lot of governors, a lot of states, governors and stuff.  There's one place where one guy does have a lot of responsibility and power is the mayor  of New York City.  It's different than being the mayor of any other city in the country.  The mayor of a lot of other cities are more figurehead than they are real mayor.  And they have a lot of other people that are kind of have a power base. 
[00:25:30]  Is the system in place?  And he's kind of like the figurehead and just keeps it going?  No.  The mayor of New York wields a lot of power, man.  It really does.  And it's not the system, though.  It's him personally.  No, if you notice, each individual mayor really has put his fingerprint on New York City.  And you could definitely tell what's gone on during his reign.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I, you know, I'm not going to vote today.  No, huh?  No. 
[00:26:00]  Who are you voting for today, Ben?  Bloomberg.  And why?  Because he's been a good mayor.  Exactly what Anthony says.  He's running like a business.  You haven't liked Bloomberg from the start.  Back when we were at NEW, I remember we got in an argument about this.  That's another thing.  You know, you take it for granted that we would have come right back after 9-11, business-wise,  shit like that, to get a businessman in there running things, you didn't notice that we,  you know, aside from right after 9-11, when New York was really hurting financially, that 
[00:26:30]  we came back from it.  Yeah.  You know?  Now, if there was a shitty mayor in there, you may have noticed and gone, oh, holy shit,  this guy stinks.  He couldn't get us back.  But what makes a shitty mayor?  Dinkins.  Dinkins.  Look at Dinkins.  But the economy was also horrendous back then.  Because of Dinkins.  I don't know about that.  I wasn't a fan of Dinkins myself, but it seems like the economy also has something to do  with whether...  It does.  And look who a government official does well or not.  Look who changed that.  Giuliani.  Giuliani brought a lot of business into New York City. 
[00:27:00]  A lot of people weren't doing business with New York when...  Actually, he came up with some great ideas.  The Washington attendant, as Bob Grant used to call him.  If they were his ideas.  Like, Giuliani, you know, got Times Square in shape.  Yeah.  Well, he had Bill Bratton.  He had a great police commissioner.  He had a great police commissioner.  He was a prosecutor.  He, you know, was very anti-crime.  As far...  Dinkins, you know, was visiting the bedsides of drug dealers that had been shot.  As opposed to the police officers that had been shot. 
[00:27:30]  And it reflected on New York.  Times Square was a mess.  Regardless of what you think about it now, it's doing business.  It's making money.  He also put cops everywhere.  I mean, remember all...  He was a pro cop.  Yeah.  There was cops everywhere when Giuliani was in office.  So, you're voting for Bloomberg.  What does he stand for, Ben?  What's he stand for?  Yeah.  That's actually a good question.  I don't know.  What does he stand for?  See, I don't...  I don't know.  But I'm not voting.  Listen, here's the thing.  That's what I find really funny when you ask people about...  Bloomberg has a good point, though, to tell you, about worrying about people voting and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  And then, what if a bunch of people like you just said, oh, fuck it, he's going to get back in.  And Ferreira gets in.  I mean, this guy...  Yeah.  I mean, he's just a jackass.  Yeah, you don't want him in there.  And one of his...  But the reality is, it's going to be Bloomberg.  Bloomberg's running the city.  Even if half the voters that usually vote stay home, he's still going to win.  Yeah, he's not even close.  He's going to win.  I wouldn't worry about it.  It's not even close.  I will bet you whatever you want to bet, it ain't happening.  And then there's a whole...  I haven't even read...  I've got a stack of stuff to go home.  There's, like, a ton of referendums on the... 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you've got to vote for those?  I don't know.  Do you know any of them?  Read...  No, Daniel was talking about, one, the Second Avenue subway.  I don't...  I still got to go through all the...  No, I...  What I find interesting in every election is when you talk to people and say,  why are you voting for Bush?  Why are you voting for Kerry?  Why are you voting for Bloomberg?  Whatever.  Yeah.  The reasons are...  Just amaze me.  They're the most simplistic reasons ever.  Yeah, well, that's kind of what they put across in a lot of the ads.  They want it to be simple.  If it comes right down to most people, me included, I don't know what the candidates stand for in general. 
[00:29:00]  You know, and I think that's most voters.  And then there's people listening right now going, oh, you're full of shit.  I know exactly what these guys stand for.  But I think in general, it's a very basic thing.  Bloomberg's been pretty straightforward with what he wants to do.  And it's tough on crime, bring business to New York, and, you know, protect New York against terrorism.  That's been his platform right there. 
[00:29:30]  And his record, you know, he stands on his record.  Ferrer?  Couldn't tell you.  I have no idea what the fuck that guy wants, but I know it's wacky.  Yeah.  When I see him uptown, marching, and people behind him speaking in strange tongues, I don't want him running things.  George the Geek from Jersey.  Hate to say it, but Rich is in fact correct, sir.  The states have sued the tobacco industry and won.  The effect is the truth commercials, they are paid for and produced by the tobacco industry as part of their settlement.  Ah. 
[00:30:00]  How about that?  If that's true, I don't know.  Speaking of Election Day, we were on top of this whole governor's race, the New Jersey governor's race.  Yeah.  From the get-go.  Very early on, you could tell these two hated each other, and it just got filthy.  It got so dirty between these two.  And I know this is a national show, but I think everyone could relate to this.  You know, you got your local politicians, and they get these ads on TV just trashing the other guy.  But we noticed right away that this governor's race here in Jersey, these guys just went for the throat. 
[00:30:30]  It got ugly.  I think Jersey-  Getting ex-wives involved, and talking about abortions, and affairs.  Corzine and Forrester.  It's great.  I think New Jersey just wants a governor that's not sticking his cock through a divider in the rest area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, coming off the last governor.  Yeah.  Especially Jersey, man.  I mean, there may be some other states where it might be tolerated a little bit better, but Jersey, no fucking way.  He just goes out partying now, is what I'm hearing. 
[00:31:00]  He's always seen in Chelsea with some blonde guys.  Really?  He's out of the P6 all the time.  Yeah, in McGreevy.  He turns up partying with the other gay guys all the time now.  Well, we got the Corzine-Forrester ads.  They made Good Morning America, so this is a national story that we were on very early, but now everyone else is jumping on.  And they did a little story on how ugly the campaign was and the political ads.  Let's listen to this audio here.  There's one race in particular. 
[00:31:30]  The race for governor of New Jersey that experts are saying is one of the nastiest races they've ever seen.  Families have been dragged into politics before, but this one is really over the top.  And ABC's Dan Harris is at a polling place in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  It's over the top, but mark my word, this is going to be the norm now.  Yeah.  All the way up to the president.  The next election, you watch how ugly it gets.  It's gotten dirty as far as the presidency goes.  But I think this is going to just take this whole political ad thing to a whole new level. 
[00:32:00]  Yep.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  No holds barred.  Duh.  No holds barred.  Barred, duh.  This morning, Dan.  Charlie, good morning.  Voters here putting an end to what has been a notably nasty campaign.  The governor's race here has the dubious distinction of featuring what may be the most high-profile use ever,  at least in a modern campaign, of a candidate's ex-wife as a political weapon.  New Jersey's governor's race featured raucous debates. 
[00:32:30]  The fact is, your lawyer said if you throw money on the table, you can...  And rumors of extramarital affairs.  But it may be remembered for this ad from the campaign of Republican Doug Forrester.  It features a quote from Democrat John Corzine's ex-wife, who said Corzine had let his family down,  and he'll probably let New Jersey down, too.  It speaks more about his character than it does mine.  It brings together a number of different things, having to do with an inclination to abandon political principles. 
[00:33:00]  This is unusual in the extreme, and it's about as nasty as a campaign gets.  Without a doubt.  Wow, an ex-wife saying something bad about her ex-husband?  Yeah.  They're going to use that?  I know.  And who's going to believe it?  And the guy the judge has put into prison for 40 years got out, and he's going to say something good about, you know,  of course his ex-wife's going to trash him, you fucking idiots.  He let his family down.  He let New Jersey down. 
[00:33:30]  And now we've got a role of wives in politics.  Another clip here.  In 2000, the ex-wife of Maryland Congressman Albert Wynn recorded a phone message for a rival campaign  saying the congressman does not respect black women.  He left me for a white woman.  And in 2004, the ex-wife of Texas Congressman Charlie Gonzalez tried and failed to get on the ballot against him.  While the involvement of ex-wives is rare, political spouses have long played a prominent role in the campaign dynamic. 
[00:34:00]  Senator Ted Kennedy insisted on having his wife by his side during his 1980 presidential run despite severe marital trouble.  The couple later divorced.  More recently, Hillary Clinton and Theresa Hines Kerry were said by some to be political liabilities.  By contrast, Laura Bush is considered an asset, as was Jacqueline Kennedy.  Voters tend to assess candidates in the full picture.  In other words, it's not just their stance on the issues, but it's the full package. 
[00:34:30]  Back here in New Jersey, if those ads featuring Corzine's ex-wife help Doug Forrester pull a come-from-behind victory,  one political analyst is predicting next campaign season we may well see more ads featuring ex-wives.  Oh, there you go.  I told you.  This is going to set a new precedent.  Ex-wives.  Oh, ex-wives getting involved.  How great is that?  Oh, cock size comes in, everything.  It's just...  Oh, both these guys, I've got to tell you.  A small little dick.  Both these guys did their job. 
[00:35:00]  I know the names of the candidates for the governor's race of New Jersey.  Yep.  Certainly do.  I usually don't really pay that close attention.  Yeah, it's been a dirty battle, but when it's over, they'll shake hands.  One will give a concession speech and talk about how great the other guy is, and we need to give our support to him.  Yeah, let's get that audio for tomorrow.  Of course.  That's going to be great audio for tomorrow.  Where they're all huggy kissy.  I guess if you have a hot chick on your side, too, that helps. 
[00:35:30]  I mean, Jackie Onassis or Kennedy was a hot chick back then.  I don't know if that helps, man.  You don't think so?  You've got to get the women's vote, too.  Yeah, if you have a hot chick, the women are going to think you're just in it for the hot chick.  Yeah, see rich women out there have brains.  You need like Bush's wife.  And they don't look at that.  She's the perfect wife.  She's not like dog ugly.  She's like librarian hot.  Librarian, motherly kind of thing.  That's what you need. 
[00:36:00]  Do you think she was hot back in the high school or college?  Oh, fuck yeah.  She looked good.  I think she looked good back in those days.  She didn't look bad.  Yeah.  She didn't look too bad.  All right.  Not like that Barbara Bush.  She looked horrid like...  Even in her 20s, she looked like she was 80 years old.  And George Sr. was like a pilot, World War II pilot.  What was he thinking?  I don't know.  He could have gotten some of that good trim back then.  I thought she looked good on the oatmeal box. 
[00:36:30]  Jesus, Rich, I need your fucking...  Oatmeal?  What?  They're little jokes you throw in a discussion.  Well, it would be nice if you pronounced oatmeal right.  What did I say?  Oatmeal.  Something like oatmeal or oatmeal.  Oatmeal.  Oat mayo.  Oatmeal.  By the way, I want to pat myself on the back today.  Guess who was the last person to cross the line at the New York City Marathon? 
[00:37:00]  Uh-oh.  Zoe.  Do we have audio of Zoe?  Are you shitting me?  I told you.  Of course.  And a few of these news stations actually reported as, you know, a brave woman and a brave story.  That's what we were saying.  And even though she was the last to cross the line, she's still a winner.  Her last, but first in our hearts, it's shut up.  I'm on to this Zoe chick.  The Zoe scam.  And I don't like her. 
[00:37:30]  I know she has MS, and that's a horrific thing to wish on anyone, but I don't like the fact  that she's taking advantage of that last ever.  There's no one more pathetic than her.  If you come in last at the New York City Marathon every year, which she does, like someone  get the stats out.  She's done it this year.  She did it last year, and I believe she did it the year before.  So the last three easily, and it probably goes back further.  Uh-huh.  You want to come in last because you want the attention.  Yeah.  And you're also sitting there because she does it with crutches and stuff. 
[00:38:00]  I know this is not a popular view to take on a show, but it really, really bothers me.  There's her picture right there.  She doesn't even dress for the race.  What was she being?  Dude, she's got an old lady, like, you know...  One of those pantsuits.  Yeah, she's got a pantsuit on, like she's going to a Broadway matinee.  At least dress the fucking part.  Don't they have special, like...  She's got a blouse on.  She's got, like, a pantsuit on. 
[00:38:30]  And she's purposely trying to come in last every year.  That means she sees other people that she's actually better than that she slows down and  lets pass her.  So she gets all the media attention at the end of the race.  Where's the story?  She finished, uh...  Yesterday around 11, around 11 o'clock noon, somewhere around there.  How do you...  What do you...  I think.  No, no, I think 8 in the morning.  Sorry.  8 in the morning.  So, almost 24 hours later.  How do you spell her stupid name?  Zoe...  Kaplowicz. 
[00:39:00]  Kaplowicz.  How do you spell her stupid first name?  Oh, Zoe is Z-O-E.  Oh.  Zoe Kaplowicz.  Kaplowicz.  K-O-P-L-O-W-I-T-Z.  Did she have, like, a Nike Swish on her crutches?  And I'm...  I'm sitting there yelling at my TV last night, like, you're not paying attention to the news  people, because she does this every year, and they're reporting it like, she's a brave  woman.  Although she came in last, she's a winner in all of our eyes. 
[00:39:30]  Like, she did that last year.  She did it the year...  She's an attention-ticking war.  ...trying to be last.  Like, there's going to be a battle of last places at some point.  Yeah.  Where somebody's going to come along and try to be more last than she is.  Someone with, like, no legs or something.  Yeah, and they're just both going to be standing there at the finish line, just going, you.  No, you.  You go.  Just bowling.  Yeah.  Getting their peeps to, like, push the other person over the line.  Push them.  Someone's kicking your body.  Grab Zoe and bodily throw her over the line so you can be last. 
[00:40:00]  You know, South Park or Family Guy, those cartoons have it in them.  They should do a piece.  Definitely.  I'm going to write them personally.  They should do a piece where they do a whole thing about a marathon and the last place finish,  and it's all these runners, if you want to call them runners, participants that have  all these horrific things wrong with them, and they're battling it out to be the last  one to cross the line so they get the media attention.  It's like the stand-up comedy.  Like, you always get, like, somebody with MS or something, and it's so hard to sit in  the audience and just watch this person drooling and scuttering through, you know. 
[00:40:30]  Well, the MS comic.  We talked to him on the air at WNW.  You know, it's funny, and how politically correct.  Like, he did a college showcase, the MS comic, and he killed at the showcase.  You know, all the kids loved him, but no one hired him because, you know, hey, we'll  be nice at the big showcase, but we're not going to have you fucking drooling and shit  in our stage.  You know what I mean?  It is a little rough.  It's tough for a guy like that.  Getting comedy.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go. 
[00:41:00]  Here's a finish last for 18 years?  No way.  She's been doing this for 18 years?  No way.  And the news is reporting it like, look at this brave fucking woman?  No way.  18 years?  Travis, where do you get your info?  It's on Google.  18 years.  She's coming last at the New York City Marathon.  And every year the news makes believe that they don't know who this person is.  There was a story from 99, or no, 2003, that said she finished for the 16th year in a row. 
[00:41:30]  So, just add two years.  Wow.  Can't be that tough of a disease if she's still kicking around.  I'm mad at myself that I didn't record all the news programs, because one after another,  there was one that said that she's known for coming in last, but then the other ones were  reporting this like, wow, look at this brave, brave, brave participant, the last one to  cross the finish line.  Jesus.  If you're doing it for 18 years, wow.  It's not special.  You're purposely trying to do this.  Yeah.  You want to be known as, you know, the person that came in last every year. 
[00:42:00]  Where's the story?  I was just about to read it, and you changed the page on me there.  I have a different story.  No, I know.  Just give me that other one.  Is that the latest story you had?  No, that was from 2003, but that's it.  No, the one you had up there.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  I remember one year I did the age walk, and I took third place.  Congrats.  All right, Zoe, Anthony, regarded as the slowest marathoner in the world.  She's not a marathoner.  Revere for her courage and determination. 
[00:42:30]  I know this is not a popular view.  I understand that.  And you can send your hate mail.  I get it every day.  It's okay.  Yeah.  But this shit is what really bothers me in this world, because there's other people  out there that deserve the attention more than she does, without a doubt.  But Zoe returns to Staten Island to start her ninth New York City marathon.  So if this is her ninth, how did she do this for 18 years in a row?  This is an old article.  New York City? 
[00:43:00]  Huh?  This is an old article.  That's what I was saying.  Oh.  Oh, my God, Eric.  But do the math.  As the MS Society's National Conference in the fall of 2000, right?  So this article was written in at least 2000, maybe 2001, right?  Yeah.  And this one from 2003 says her 16th.  Yeah, but go back.  This is saying she's going for her ninth New York City marathon.  But if they're using the date 2000, the article, how old could the article be? 
[00:43:30]  And then if you do the math, how could it possibly add up?  Two different articles saying two different things.  Comment.  All right.  That's a good answer.  Two different articles saying two different things.  So we'll find out.  So we'll find out.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  But this article says, at the MS Society's National Conference in the fall of 2000, Zoe  Kaplowitz of New York City was named MS Athlete of the Year.  There you go.  But she was not present to accept her award.  She was preparing to run her eighth consecutive New York City marathon. 
[00:44:00]  She was preparing to run her eighth consecutive New York City marathon.  How do you prepare for this?  I don't know.  Put sneakers on your crutches.  Oh.  Zoe Kaplowitz has MS, which is, you know, horrific.  She has been living with balance impairment, fatigue, and spasticity for the past 22 years.  She uses two crutches.  She is famous.  Has the world's slowest woman runner.  She's not a runner.  She's a walker.  It takes her more than 24 grueling hours to complete the 26.2-mile race. 
[00:44:30]  Why she does it is as much of a story as how she manages.  Fourteen years elapsed between her diagnosis and her first attempt at the main event in  long-distance running.  MS had not defeated her in those years.  She continued to be independent and self-supporting.  In fact, she founded her own business, Smart Moves Trucking.  But in 1987, she was 60 pounds overweight, and getting about was increasingly difficult.  Her turning point came when she choked on a vitamin C pill. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, pig.  You can act like a man!  That's horrid.  Well, she's putting herself out there for this kind of crap, you know?  She's a big woman, so how the hell is she getting all the rest of the food down?  Her business part has saved her life using the Heimlich Maneuver, but her outrage that 
[00:45:30]  an innocent pill might have killed her fueled a crucial re-examination of her life.  Ah.  Oh, and then I just, uh, where is it?  Oh, boy.  Uh, we just lost it.  Oh, here's the latest one?  Well, that's where I got mine.  All right, now Travis has given me the 2003 article.  Travis?  All right, let me continue with this.  Uh, I wanted back what I had surrendered to this disease, she told Mike, who featured  her story in his book, Courage, the True Stories of American Sports Heroes. 
[00:46:00]  She's a courageous woman, but she's not a sports hero.  I decided I needed to do the most outrageous thing that I could imagine, she said.  World-class runners from all over the globe come to New York for the marathon, but most  of the 26,000 runners are crazy New Yorkers who delight in this special test of strength  and determination.  Zoe Kaplowich wanted to be one of them.  She found expert coaching...  She found expert coaching and friendly support at the Achilles Track Club, a remarkable organization 
[00:46:30]  for runners with disabilities.  I didn't set out to be famous, Zoe said.  At the beginning, it was about my own discipline, showing, just showing up for the training every  day.  When she completed her first marathon, she and her lone Achilles Track Club companion crossed  the deserted finish line, but her achievement was noted in a small news item which caught  the eye of the MS Society.  The very first MS Walk was then being organized, and Zoe agreed as an official walk ambassador.  Every year since, she has been a linchpin of the MS Walk, which is a very cool thing, obviously, 
[00:47:00]  in the spring, and an increasingly famous participant in the New York City Marathon in the fall.  Zoe said recently, over the years, I've become a symbol of endurance for people.  I get letters all year long.  I carry them with me when I run.  What I do is a metaphor for life, just like the marathon itself.  It means you can get somewhere by putting one foot after another.  There you go.  She's a very courageous woman today, everybody.  Mm-hmm.  And because that story was on a blue background, I'm now blind. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you to that website.  She didn't carry all those notes weighing her down.  She might have came in at like 23 hours.  Oh.  Carries the notes with her.  The letters.  The letters.  The notes.  All right.  Well, congratulations to Zoe.  She did it again.  I don't know how she did it.  Courage.  Courage, I guess.  Courage.  We're looking behind her and going, oh, that guy is worse than me.  I better slow down.  Slow up a little.  I better sit down for a while and let that guy pass. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  And that's where I think it's not that fair.  Really.  If you think about it.  Really.  You have to know you're in last place.  Shouldn't it just happen?  Yeah.  Like all of a sudden you're like, oh my God, I'm what?  I'm last?  Last again?  All right.  We should take our first break, Anthony.  Right.  We've got lots more to do today on the old program.  Rich Voss sitting in today.  What are you promoting, Rich?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I don't know.  What do you want?  San Francisco next week? 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  We're a national show.  If you're going to be in San Francisco.  You have to punchline next week in San Francisco.  All right.  Very good.  Nice club.  Oh, it's great.  I've been there a couple times.  I like the job they do over there.  I like San Francisco.  San Francisco's a cool town.  It's a very interesting city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, but I...  Right?  You don't see that.  It's all in a section.  You don't see it.  You don't see it.  I'm telling you.  When I went to San Francisco for the first time, I was like, what?  No.  A little nervous.  But you walk around, you don't see that shit. 
[00:49:00]  It's all in one area.  Listen, I went on my first honeymoon there with Tom.  Well, first of all, the restaurants are great.  It's a beautiful city.  Just because there's gay people.  New York.  I'd say it's bad.  No, I think it's one of the coolest cities.  Well, it gets a bad rap is what I'm saying because, you know, ever since we were little  fellas here, you know, you heard San Francisco gay.  So, you think the first time you go there, you're going to see it all over the place.  It's not.  It's not.  You don't see that at all. 
[00:49:30]  We went camping when we were kids.  We didn't know to Cape Cod.  We ended up...  We went to Provincetown.  We didn't know.  That is gay.  Provincet...  Let me tell you.  You go fishing there, all you can get is, like, blowfish.  I mean, it's gay.  What?  Definitely needs the rim shot.  No, but I'm telling you, we didn't know.  You just did a blowfish joke?  Yeah.  It came out, but I guess I'm...  What?  What?  Just come...  I can't help it.  It's a good reference.  It's not a fucking gay town.  You're fishing, and it's fucking blowfish. 
[00:50:00]  What do you want?  Fish.  All right.  Because it's gay.  Very good.  Can we try to interview Zoe on her remarkable...  Oh, she does Got Milk ads and everything.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  She's doing Got Milk ads.  Wow.  See, she found a little...  Endorsements.  I give her a little respect.  She found a little niche for herself.  She goes, hey, I could make a name for myself.  Yep.  Coming in last every year.  But the point I'm making, because I'm going to get killed after the show today, she's  purposely doing this.  Yeah.  So why is that an accomplishment? 
[00:50:30]  If she's going out of her way to make sure she's in last...  She's not coming in last because she's the worst participant in the marathon.  Well, but now I respect her because she's doing ads and she's capitalizing, trying to  make money.  Yeah.  And how else...  So this way, it's a scam, but at least she's making some cash.  If she's making money off of it, then if she's just doing it to be last and get the...  Who gives a shit, you know?  But if she's going to make cash off it, right?  All right.  Well, when we get back, we've got to talk about the fake fireman.  They're still trying to find him.  Trying to find him still.  And those fine cheerleaders in, what, the North Carolina... 
[00:51:00]  Carolina Panthers.  Carolina Panthers, I mean, yeah.  We'll talk about that and the latest on that as well.  So get us out of here for a little while, Derek.  We got the Hanson brothers coming in today?  No, the Hanson brothers are the hockey players.  Hanson Triplett.  This is Hanson.  Yeah.  And...  We're talking about the Mbop guys, which I'm sure they love being referred to as.  All right, look, there's three of them. 
[00:51:30]  There's three of us.  I got dibs on Taylor.  You guys fight over Zach and Isaac.  Holy crap.  What are we going to talk to these guys about?  Didn't Jay Moore want to have sex with little Zach?  Uh, yeah.  He used to talk about...  Was it Zach?  The drummer.  The little drummer.  No one ever wanted Isaac.  Actually, Isaac, as I recall on the show a couple of times, somebody may have called him  the Franken-Hanson. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, I might have to remind Isaac as the older...  Who that person was when he comes in here.  Who was it?  I'm looking at him right now.  He's Jimmy.  He's the person that is turning into a creep in front of our eyes.  He's not as you are.  Um-bop, Willie.  Um-bop, Willie.  Well, it's just you had little Zach on the drums and, uh, and cute Taylor singing.  Um-bop, Willie.  And then Isaac was like the older one already, and he would play guitar and it just kind of 
[00:52:30]  didn't fit.  And he was just like, Grandpa, get me the guitar.  Um-bop, bop, bop.  Um-bop, bop, bop.  Taylor, get down from that tree immediately.  Grandpa, Grandpa, we're doing oom-bop again.  Are you trying to say he had kind of a square face?  Well, it was sort of, you know, if any of the three Hanson boys had to be Frank and Hanson, I think it would have been Isaac. 
[00:53:00]  Will we play oom-bop again tonight?  No, no, no, no.  I won't, I won't, I won't.  I won't.  Dust comes out of the stage.  His big oversized shoes, boots, whatever the hell he wore.  Yeah.  He would, like, tune up his guitar and then also turn the bolts on his neck. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, and a party rock!  Yeah.  Oh, and a party rock!  Oh, and a party rock!  Oh, and a party rock! 
[00:54:00]  Oh, and a party rock! 
[00:54:30]  Oh, and a party rock! 
[00:55:00]  Who's that? Drew Boogie. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. Thanks, Drew.  Gotta love the Drewster.  Does a few remixes for the radio program.  Let's say hi to Paul on Long Island. He has MS.  Ow.  Paul, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, hey. Oh, I had MS for 14 years.  How many years?  14.  Sorry to hear that.  No, no, it's no problem. I still lift weights. I go to the gym three times a week, and most people, if at all, like me, it's a relaxing, remitting form where you get a little flare-up and it goes away.  So this fucking Zoe, like, she's like the worst of the worst. 
[00:55:30]  So I just want to say, like, you know, just fucking most people like me where they don't even know you have it.  Huh. How about that?  But you know what the fuck the thing is? It just comes out of nowhere. Like, fucking boom. You get yelled at my busy spouse.  Aw, man, you're, uh, I don't know. Maybe your throat has MS or you got a bad phone. I don't know.  Yeah.  Something's going on with the phone. Maybe you get a better, uh, better connection and give us a call back. All right, Paul?  All right, Paul.  Your phone really stinks. You'll notice that on the replay.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  A bunch of other things to get to today. They did a Wi-Fi story on Fox 5 here in New York?  Yes.  I wanted to see what this is about really fast.  XM just kicking ass as far as satellite radio goes.  Oh, yeah.  The Delphi XM MiFi, is that what it's called?  MiFi, it is. It does XM satellite radio on the go. So we've had home, we've had car. Now you can actually bring it with you.  So it's actually picking up those satellite signals. It also has storage for up to five hours of either talk or music. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  So, you know, of course, inside Grand Central, you're not getting a signal.  Exactly. So it's kind of like, uh, kind of like an iPod thing or something that records for you, but...  Exactly.  But you've got your own music.  Right. And a little bigger because the antenna built in.  Definitely.  Wow, that guy had no idea.  No, none.  Absolutely none.  Thanks. Thanks for the push.  That's the guy on Fox here in New York that does the weather.  Yeah.  And they give him some other things to do every once in a while, and you would think he would do his research.  Something. 
[00:57:00]  He has no idea.  Yeah. The MiFi's been out for over a year now.  Yeah.  I've been enjoying the MiFi for well over a year.  Sort of like an iPod thing.  Well, not really.  It's live satellite.  It's live satellite.  Right, exactly.  You can record stuff if you're in an environment where you don't get the live signal, but there you go.  My throat is killing me.  Is it?  What do you need?  I just want to throw this on the table today.  Today, I'm getting my yearly strep goddamn throat. 
[00:57:30]  Penicillin.  It's just...  Well, what I get every year is that...  What is it?  The five flu?  Huh?  Bird flu.  Oh, speaking of the bird flu.  Let me...  I got a great story about the bird flu we'll get to in a second.  But...  Get this damn strep throat every fucking year.  And they got this uber penicillin.  I think it starts with a Z.  Five or six pills and done.  Done.  I got to get to my doctor immediately and get those pills.  Immediately.  If I don't, it's like a two-week hell. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You're the best.  Whenever I had a root canal...  Because the first time I had a root...  Do you know what penicillin I'm talking about?  It's like...  Yeah.  All you do is take five or six pills.  Yeah.  Like you take two the first day and then one, one, one, one.  One, one.  Yeah, there you go.  And then you're done.  It's the best.  I had it...  Once I had a root canal and then without the penicillin, it got infected and my whole face swelled up.  Yeah.  So, and they had to cut my gun and squeeze the pus out with a plier.  I'm not bullshitting.  I had to do a TV show that day, like Friday night video, and my face looked like a fucking grapefruit. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And I go into the doctor's office and there are pliers and they're pressing against where  the tooth, where the root canal was and pus was pouring out.  Ugh.  So, from then on in, whenever I had a root canal, I took the penicillin, whether or not  and nothing came back.  It's like...  How many root canals have you had?  I got to have $4,000 worth of more work done on my teeth in two weeks.  Why the bad teeth, Rich?  Hey.  Well, I...  Have a crack?  I had a...  You know... 
[00:59:00]  I had a lot of cavities.  Me too.  That was my thing.  I still haven't had a root canal or anything else.  I just...  I don't know.  My teeth, I guess, like, if you see pictures, like, in the front teeth, it just got cavities  in the middle.  I was on mucking.  I got cavities in the middle.  So, then you got to get it filed in a root canal.  I've had so many root canals.  But why the bad teeth, you think?  Just born with it, or...  I don't know.  You know...  Did you brush your teeth growing up?  Did you floss?  Yeah.  I wasn't really big on flossing, I don't think.  Flossing's huge.  Yeah, that's the big thing now. 
[00:59:30]  But now, I have, like, a bridge right here with three teeth or four teeth.  Yeah.  And it's connected, like...  Well, anyhow, the last tooth under the cap or bridge rotted.  So, now these three are loose.  Oh, my God.  So, I just had to...  Now that I got to do a whole new bridge with five teeth, it's like four fucking thousand  dollars, you know?  And what gets me is the teeth are kind of big, and they're caps.  You would think that I would have them filed, or then, you know, hey, please don't put fucking 
[01:00:00]  big teeth in my mouth this time, you know?  They don't look that big anymore.  Because I had them filed down.  Oh, that's right.  You did?  Yeah.  I was walking around like piano things.  You had ridiculously big, fake teeth.  And as a dentist, you would think they'd have that figured out by now.  It's not that difficult.  I understand they're still trying to figure out the plastic surgery and crap like that,  but when it comes to giving you nice teeth, I don't understand why...  You see this all the time when you're walking around, people that have the fake teeth  in front, like, they're fucking huge.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:00:30]  My dentist, I mean, he does...  Whatever.  I don't know.  I was in his office last week, and he's fucking pressing, and I'm looking up, and there's  nothing worse than seeing, like, snot in your dentist.  You know, just clean your face.  You know?  Inbred wants in.  Inbred!  Yo, Opie.  Hey.  Why the hell are you asking a former drug addict why he's got bad teeth?  Well, do you think all drugs rot your teeth?  Is that what...  Crack does, right?  Cocaine?  Does cocaine rot your teeth or something?  I don't know.  I don't know if crack does, or you just don't take care of them. 
[01:01:00]  So this guy called...  I think because you're smoking all that crack back in the day, and the last thing you're  worrying about is flossing.  So I think the guy makes a good point.  All right.  Thanks, Inbred.  Yeah, punch it up.  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Very good.  Hello.  That was Joe's shareholder.  He's still trying to get airtime.  I think probably because we said that XM is kicking ass.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the numbers.  We're kicking ass.  He's going to debunk us.  How is he going to debunk us?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Stock's a little down, but that will come back.  We still have a massive lead on the little doggy company.  The Howard factor is having an effect, but not as big of an effect as they thought.  Oh, it's big suspension.  And, yeah, Howard got suspended.  We're all like, we don't know what to do in the radio world.  It's just an amazing, amazing story today.  Stunned.  Obviously, he had the day off, and they're both taking advantage of it.  You don't have to be in radio as long as we have to know that.  And these stupid news crews. 
[01:02:00]  Pick right up on it.  That's why, like, it came up yesterday about the salt on the media thing and, you know, where's the line and stuff.  There is no line.  These fucking, these stations that we watch all morning long, they're a bunch of whores.  I get more and more fed up every day.  They're all reporting on the Howard suspension today.  You know.  Like it's news.  Just do a little research and talk to just a couple experts in the business, and they'll tell you it's just a stunt.  Yeah.  It's just a stunt to get everyone talking.  See, we're talking about it.  You know, it's brilliant as far as that goes, but it's not a real suspension. 
[01:02:30]  They have no news.  They exploit whatever they can.  No, they got news, but these guys are lazy.  They don't do their just basic research.  We just had a story on the MiFi.  The guy had no clue.  You would think if you're doing a story on the MiFi that the night before, maybe you would read up on it a little bit.  Do a little research.  And just get the basic facts out there.  That guy had no clue.  He was just winging it.  And they do that all the time.  Does that happen when you guys get interviewed, the worst fucking question? 
[01:03:00]  Well, that's where it started.  That's where it started with me.  Like, I was clueless.  You know, I was one of these guys when I was brought up on Long Island, you know, whatever I read, heard, or watched, I took as the truth.  I'll admit that.  I'm embarrassed to say that.  And then over the years, that kind of just eroded.  And then when Anthony and I started getting interviewed, and then when we got in trouble, we got in trouble a lot in radio.  And the facts that came out that were so wrong, just the basic stuff. 
[01:03:30]  Like, when we fucked up with the Sex for Sam thing, they reported that we were a morning show.  It's like, that's like the basic thing.  Figure out what time they're on.  Figure out what time they did this stunt.  But, I mean, you're talking CNN, Fox News.  They all reported the facts wrong.  And they've done that in our careers for so many years that I finally had.  I'm like, look, it's time to exploit the hell out of them, you know?  When we were off the air, Ant and I discussed this on the phone, one of the things we wanted to do with this new show is to exploit how ridiculous the news is. 
[01:04:00]  You know?  Speaking of which, I got a great little story about the bird flu.  Bird flu is all the rage.  Nice.  Where's that?  Rolling Stone.  Holy shit, that's very cool.  See?  You know, you gotta be fair.  We bitch and complain when XM doesn't do the right thing.  But Ben just walked in with the latest issue of Rolling Stone Magazine with Billy Joe from Green Day on the cover.  And you open up to page 99, there's a huge Opie and Anthony ad. 
[01:04:30]  Laugh until it hurts, Opie and Anthony, only on XM radio.  And then it has our cartoon figures that are, you know.  Soon to be gone.  I'm hoping, because it's overplayed a little bit.  But still, getting the job done.  We're doing a photo shoot.  And now America's best-selling satellite radio is only $49.99.  Wow.  That's the roadie too, I'm assuming, right?  Yeah.  That's a great little ad.  That's a nice ad right there.  You're doing a photo shoot?  Yeah, next Monday.  No, Monday we have to go shopping Monday. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, they insulted us by saying Monday we go shopping for clothes for you guys.  And then Tuesday we do the photo shoot.  Before I was a comic, like I read this thing, me and my friend, you could be a model.  He didn't know it was a scam, and we came in for like a portfolio.  Yeah.  You know, I'm five foot five, you know, rotten teeth.  And, you know, it's a scam to get people in.  And they had me, there was one shot where I was laying on the ground on a fur rug with  a leather coat open.  With no shirt and a leather coat. 
[01:05:30]  Like, I'm so fucking stud.  I looked like I just got gang raped.  Yikes.  It was the biggest scam.  And we had this portfolio, and we go, now what do we do with it?  Yeah.  And they just suck at you.  Do you have those pictures?  Oh, if I, if I, believe in you.  You gotta find those pictures.  I would love, let me tell you.  It looked like a little, laying on a fur rug.  My long, curly, rotten hair.  Oh.  Greasy.  The rug was probably greasy when I got up.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, speaking of the bird flu, the bird flu is all the rage.  And, uh, Fox 5 here in New York, they teased this bird flu thing all, uh, all night long 
[01:06:00]  on their newscast and finally told you what the, what the big deal was.  But basically, what do they say?  There's a, uh, uh, uh, there's a, uh, uh, a popular hot dog topping that could help combat  the bird flu.  Mustard?  There's only three choices.  Relish?  Oh, four choices.  Okay.  Ketchup.  But they're teasing this, like something you, you put on a hot dog could help you against 
[01:06:30]  the bird flu.  All right.  How ridiculous is this thing?  So here's the news.  This is, uh, they felt this was such an important story.  They teased it all night long.  And hot dogs aren't exactly health food, but could one popular topping actually help fight  the bird flu?  And then later on in the newscast.  Well, hot dog, could a popular topping be the secret weapon in the battle against the  bird flu?  Pussy walls.  No, that's a hot dog and a pussy joke. 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  Sauerkraut.  Sauerkraut.  That's it.  But why?  Why?  Well, you may think that sauerkraut is just good for hot dogs, but it might be good for  fighting the flu, maybe even the bird flu.  There are reports out of Korea about chickens infected with the avian flu that got better  after eating the dish kimchi. 
[01:07:30]  It's somewhat similar to sauerkraut.  Even men's health magazine says sauerkraut is essential to surviving a flu pandemic.  Essential?  Why is it essential?  Let's get a doctor on the phone.  No info there.  No info there at all on why sauerkraut would help against the flu.  They thought it was important to tease it all night long on Fox.  Why do all these diseases start in China or Asia?  It's always from over. 
[01:08:00]  They've got to be the sickest.  The latest case is in Vietnam.  The bird flu.  Uh-huh.  It still hasn't gone from person to person yet.  We were...  It's just from birds to people.  Right.  What I say is this.  We made it through the AIDS epidemic.  We'll be fine.  Don't worry about the bird flu.  What do you mean we made it through?  It's still going on.  Yeah, but it was a big disappointment in the end.  What?  To who?  When they started talking...  I'm being dead serious. 
[01:08:30]  When they started talking about AIDS, they were talking about the end of the world.  They're talking about a disease that you get from effing.  Yeah.  And we survived.  But it's still growing, so we didn't...  I don't know.  We got it under control.  Yeah.  We kind of got it under control.  It's growing in like Africa.  It's a horrific disease.  And yes, in the poorer countries, it's still completely out of control.  But we got some of these...  We got these AIDS cocktails and stuff.  And look at Magic Johnson. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, he's been on going forever.  But is there like...  I don't know.  I don't lead up on that.  All I'm saying is if we got through the AIDS thing, because we've been at it, what, for  over 20 years, the AIDS thing, right?  And it never became the thing they said it was going to be, where it was going to just  wipe out entire civilizations, basically.  Yeah.  You know, it's a horrific disease, and a lot of people are getting it and suffering from  it.  But it wasn't the big thing they said it was going to be.  Especially because, you know, you get it from having sex. 
[01:09:30]  Well, no, you get it from also drug...  Well, yeah, exactly.  But like, okay, if they say it's blood, right, you got it...  And they say like these doctors get pricked or something, and they get it or what...  But can't you get it from tattoos?  Yeah.  How about this?  There was a time they thought the mosquitoes were helping out the AIDS thing.  They said, you know, they were transporting the AIDS virus from human to human.  It all started...  All that scared crap that we had to deal with.  And now we got the bird thing to worry about. 
[01:10:00]  You know?  And that's all I eat is chicken and turkey.  I don't really...  You know, red...  Well, I think if you eat it, you're fine.  Yeah, I don't think you get it from...  I don't think you get it from eating it.  Yeah, I don't think you get it from a cooked chicken.  Well, how else would you get it?  Not from a cooked...  I don't even know how you get it.  Huh?  I have no idea.  Chicken sneezes on you?  Fucking a chicken?  Fucking...  Let's say hi to Matt in Ohio.  He's going to tell us how the sauerkraut helps the bird flu. 
[01:10:30]  Yes, Matt?  Yeah, real quick.  It's the malic acid derivative that's in sauerkraut.  It disallows the virus from replicating.  It actually disrupts the way the T cell binds.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they say.  The Japanese is Japanese science.  The Japanese science is third world science.  I was going to say, I think a lot of this science stuff is mumbo-jumbo.  I'm a college professor, so I deal with it all the time.  I have a feeling I'm coming down with just the regular flu right now.  Should I run out and eat a pound of sauerkraut, and will I be fine? 
[01:11:00]  I'll tell you what.  The thing to try is try that Airborne.  It's worked for me really well.  It's just an herbal cocktail.  And I know you're into that sort of thing.  No, I mean, I'll do whatever it takes to get rid of this stupid thing.  Anyways, punch it out.  All right, thank you.  You know, they say sauerkraut.  What if there's something stupid that will cure AIDS, or a disease?  You know, sauerkraut.  Yeah.  You know, something they're putting billions of billions of dollars.  You just eat like fluffernut or mayonnaise or something.  And that does it?  Something trial and error. 
[01:11:30]  It's going to be something that's going to be...  I'm sure in labs all over America, they're trying all sorts of combinations for all these  diseases.  Drug companies make so much fucking money.  Have you ever gotten a prescription without insurance?  No.  It's a lot of money.  Well, no, I haven't.  Even with the insurance, you know, you get something.  Tell something else we don't know.  No, I'm just saying it's just, you know, I'm bringing up some subjects about, you know,  health.  Damien from his big rig, I guess. 
[01:12:00]  Damien the trucker, what's up?  Damien.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, I got the answer to why you guys, the sauerkraut works.  In the process of making it into kraut and kimchi, they use vinegar, but also there's a bacteria  that's developed that stays into it, and it attacks the virus.  So, what are we supposed to do?  Well, you can eat, I mean, I heard the one guy saying, am I going to eat a pound of sauerkraut?  Dude, you can have a real sore stomach, and you're going to get the shits. 
[01:12:30]  You don't have to eat that much.  Oh, you can eat a little bit of sauerkraut, or you can eat spicier foods, stuff with vinegar  in it, you know, like Italian salad dressing.  Just eat better.  Get a lot of fluids, you know.  Eat stuff that's easy for your stomach to break down.  Everybody's going to get the flu, but this bird flu they got going around, the virus  hasn't even mutated to where humans can carry it, so it's not going to bother us.  Well, unfortunately, every, I don't know, 100 years or so, like, the planet decides  to help itself out. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Shakes off like a wet dog.  Yeah, it wants to shake some people off its surface.  So, I think we're heading toward one of those times again.  That guy was too smart to be a truck driver.  He did something, like, 10 years ago where he got, you know, he just ruined his life  and he had to become a truck driver because he's too smart to know all that shit.  Shane from Rockland.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Shane.  All right, the only way that you can possibly contract this bird flu fucking thing is you  need mass amounts of bird shit, and it has to dry up, and when it dries up, you have 
[01:13:30]  to breathe in the dust like dander from a cat or something.  That's the only way to contract it.  And what, do you breathe in the dried up bird shit?  Yeah, that's the only way to get it.  Yeah, but what's bird shit used for?  Fertilizer?  Uh, bird shit isn't actually used for anything.  Only, uh, livestock shit would be used for fertilizer.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  And, uh, by the way, uh, Rich.  Oh, here we go.  I saw you down in Seaside Heights at that Portobello mushroom fucking place above the Aztec. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that was last, like, a year and a half ago.  Yeah, a year and a half ago, two years ago.  Yeah.  Listen, dude, you were really funny.  Once I had five shots, and my girlfriend hit me in the head with a brick.  Jesus.  Oh, I actually got something off that one.  Okay, good.  No, dude, you were great that night.  You killed.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, a lot of people like to make fun of, uh, Rich's stand-up, but the fact is he does  great.  Give him a little Vienna sausage fingers.  All right, thank you.  A bunch of people bringing up some interesting, uh, and, and interesting connection between the  bird flu and Rich Voss. 
[01:14:30]  Yes, Pete?  Hey, Rich, you're doing okay this morning.  I know how important it is for you to know that.  Um, thank you.  You're doing mediocre.  Anyway.  What's that again?  Wait, mediocre.  He said okay, Rich.  Just shut up.  All right, thank you.  Let me get out on my point.  Except okay.  Didn't the trunk of your rolls have, like, the cure for the world, then?  Oh, yeah.  It had the sauerkraut in the rolls.  He had a big thing.  Yeah.  And, uh, is that it?  I mean, don't you have something to follow that?  No, they're just bringing up the fact that they remember you talking about the Rolls-Royce that 
[01:15:00]  you almost bought in the sauerkraut was in the truck.  That was to cover the mildew smell and the bird shit in the back.  Yeah.  And the bird flew a cure right there in your car.  God, that Rolls looks so good online.  Let's go to Dan in Canada.  Hello.  Hey, Dan.  What's up?  Oh, that guy just stole my thunder.  I was going to say, you figured out what was wrong with Rich Voss's Rolls there.  He had the bird flu.  That's why it stalled on the test drive.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  See that?  All right.  KFC orders bird flu plan, Anthony.  Concerned that a possible avian flu outbreak might leave Americans to chicken heart or to 
[01:15:30]  eat poultry.  Oh, ho.  Kentucky Fried Chicken is reportedly developing a campaign to assure them it's finger-licking  safe.  How are they doing that?  KFC's parent company, Yum Brands, has been putting together a contingency plan, including  consumer education and TV ads.  AdAge.com reported yesterday.  One poultry marketer, Purdue Farms, has posted information on its website about avian influenza,  promising customers we carefully monitor the health of every flock. 
[01:16:00]  Are people stopping?  They will.  And Thanksgiving coming up, you think a lot of people are going to bail on the old turkey?  You'll see it on the news.  There's people afraid of avian flu not buying turkeys this year.  We're going for steaks this year.  What are you going to do?  Ham?  We're going for really good steaks this year and turkey burgers.  Just because we want to do something different.  Something a little different?  Yeah.  We were sitting around at my nephew's christening there over the weekend, and we're deciding  where to have Thanksgiving this year. 
[01:16:30]  And all of a sudden, my brother Quinn goes, hey, I got a good idea.  I'll have it at my house, and let's just get steaks.  Why do we have to eat turkey?  Then my brother has to pipe in that...  Someone traditional.  Yeah, but then my brother makes a good point.  Every year, the turkey's dry.  It doesn't matter who cooks it and how you cook it.  It's always a big letdown, the old turkey every Thanksgiving.  So my brother's like, why don't we just get really, really good steaks and barbecue?  And then for the traditional people that are coming, just a few turkey burgers laying  around.  Turkey burger?  Or maybe one of those little turkey breasts. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I like taking the turkey corcus, and then you make the soup out of it.  But that's, you know...  Who does that?  I do.  I make a fucking good turkey soup, man.  That's the only thing...  You don't do it?  You don't take the turkey?  Whatever.  I don't have too much time.  I don't even do that.  What do you sit around with?  A turkey?  I go to like grandma's house.  People cook, and then I leave.  No food.  You sit around with a big pot?  Yeah, yeah.  And just let it boil all day?  Yeah, you throw some celery and onions in your dish.  Oh, God.  Boring.  Well, what else are you going to do?  Huh?  The day after Thanksgiving, whatever. 
[01:17:30]  Go to the fucking mall for a million...  I don't know.  Meanwhile, worried officials of third world countries yesterday called for improved access  to bird flu vaccines and drugs, even as the World Bank estimated that a pandemic lasting  a year could cost up to $800 billion, Anthony.  Wow.  India, Laos, Cambodia, and other Asian nations backed by South Africa and other developing  countries are among those seeking help in combating the spread of the virus.  World Health Organization Director General Lee Yong-wook said it was only a matter of time before 
[01:18:00]  an avian flu virus becomes humanly transmittable.  Then no society will be exempt, he said.  Close the gates.  No more air travel to Asian nations.  That's it.  Gotta draw the line in the sand.  I think it's a lot of hype.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think it's like a great coming attraction, but I think the movie's going to blow.  I think the movie's just going to blow. 
[01:18:30]  It has great special effects and stuff in the coming attraction, and they spliced it together  nice, but I think in the end, it's going to be a big bust.  Just like that Y2K thing.  That was supposed to take down the entire world, remember?  Oh, God.  I took...  I had like...  What did it do?  Nothing.  It did nothing.  Exactly.  And we worked in Times Square that night.  That was nothing.  You know, no one came into New York hardly that night.  It just...  Absolutely nothing happened.  Well, what did...  And then all the computer geeks claimed, well, it was because we took care of the situation. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  We got on top of it, and we took care of it.  Shut up.  Nothing was going to happen.  Master Poe from EverQuest 2.  Yeah.  Typical fucking Jew.  He has to use the whole fucking turkey.  That's...  Deep-fried that turkey.  We tried that one year.  It stinks.  I hate the deep-fried turkey thing.  Adam in Tampa.  What's up?  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  I just want to let you know if you want to not try turkey, man, deep-fry that bitch. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, I've heard of that.  It's unbelievable.  It comes out juicy.  It's great, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, by the way, I'm a Huntington boy down here in Tampa.  You guys should broadcast down here.  It's 85 and sunny.  Well, no one has gotten back to us.  We want to, you know, bail on New York for the month of January and go somewhere warm.  Oh, come on.  And no one has...  Come on down here, fellas.  I'm out.  I can't.  No one has a plan yet.  We're hoping that someone comes up with a plan as far as that goes.  Bullman from his big rig as well. 
[01:20:00]  Bullman the trucker.  What's up?  Hey, ONA on the road.  202.  202, buddy.  Nice.  That's right, man.  Out here, you're keeping us busy.  Hey, listen, man.  My granny's been pumping cabbage juice down my neck just as a little baby.  Ugh.  Cabbage juice.  I think she might have put it in her nipple or something and give it to us.  You know, some of that home goodness shit.  What is cabbage juice supposed to do?  Hey, that's the same thing as, you know, sauerkraut. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the same stuff.  It's pickle, cabbage, and, you know, that's what it is.  The juice and cabbage and...  Is it one of those home remedies?  Oh, I guess.  Yeah, that bee pollen and vinegar, man.  That's all she's pumped down her necks.  We only had one home remedy.  Actually, my dad had a couple home remedies that were ridiculous.  You know, we played a lot of sports growing up in my family, so we get the old athlete's  foot.  And instead of going out and getting the Desinex, the easy cure for athlete's foot, you just 
[01:21:00]  throw it on and it's gone the next day, basically.  Uh-huh.  But when you have seven kids in your family, I guess you can't buy all the...  And for the sugar and margarine on your feet?  So my dad swore that, like, he would take a bath or a shower or what have you, and then  at the end of the bath, take some soap and just kind of, you know, rub the soap in between  your toes.  And that fixed it?  And leave it there.  For how long?  Which would make it so much worse and so much itchier, but he claims that cured athlete's 
[01:21:30]  foot.  Why don't you just put some insulation in your sneakers?  Installation?  It's insulation.  Oh, my God.  Insulation.  You can't be serious.  Wait, I got to keep track today.  You have to just be goofing.  I got to keep track today.  Two.  Two mess-ups.  Insulation instead of insulation.  Insulation.  Insulation.  And what was the other one, Ant?  The oatmeal one?  Yeah.  Oatmeal. 
[01:22:00]  Instead of oatmeal, he said oatmeal.  Oatmeal.  Oatmeal.  All right.  And if there's any others, please let us know out there in Radio Land.  Okay.  Athletes, how do you get, like, when you get, like, jock itch?  That's the same as athlete's foot, basically.  What is that?  Fungus.  Where does it come from?  I don't get the jock itch, thank God.  What's it from, sweating or something?  Yeah.  You got to keep clean down there.  Sweaty ball bag.  Sweaty ball bag.  Keep your sack clean.  Well, of course you wash your sack when you're taking a shower.  Everybody watches their sack.  See, I think if you get jock itch, you're just not really taking the shower seriously. 
[01:22:30]  Well, then that's the same as if you get athlete's foot.  It's the same thing.  The problem with athlete's foot, and a lot of people will agree, we don't really pay attention  to our feet in the shower.  Every once in a while, you'll lift the one foot up and give it a quick scrub, but you're  not really spending time on your feet in the shower, and you don't dry them properly because,  quite frankly, it's a pain in the ass.  Hence, the fungus is allowed to grow.  It's a little moist down there, and you're not cleaning it well to begin with, but if 
[01:23:00]  you're not cleaning your business, and you're getting the jock itch, you're really lazy in  the shower.  But you could clean your balls, go to sleep or whatever, or just you're wearing underwear,  and it's hot and you're sweaty.  Wouldn't that cause it?  You know what I'm saying?  If you're laying in bed and you're sweating at night, it doesn't mean your balls are dirty  if you get...  I don't know.  Wash.  You just gotta wash, and you won't get either one. 
[01:23:30]  I'm just saying, this shit is itching the hell out of me.  You got it?  You got jock it?  No, I don't know.  It's just a...  Like, right...  Oh, no.  Right?  Not, like, on my balls, but, like, between, like, my balls and my legs.  Right, where it meets?  Yeah, where it meets.  I know what you're doing.  It's what?  You're shaving, right?  My balls?  No, I never shave down there.  Well, actually, guys are shaving their balls.  You make it sound like it's a crazy thing.  Well, they wouldn't shave their balls.  Here we go again, because, you know, you shaved your balls?  Yes, I shaved my fucking balls, and if we go to the phones, I think I'll find more people 
[01:24:00]  that shave than don't.  People say that's gay.  But you make it sound like it's all, uh, shocking.  Well, no, but no, you wouldn't shave your balls.  You shave above your balls.  You know, the hair patch you're talking about.  You don't shave the ball balls.  No, people are shaving their balls.  Oh, yeah.  The ball balls?  Yeah.  Like the sack?  Yeah.  How can you, you can't, you mean you can cut, you can't shave it because it's not smooth.  It doesn't really cut.  You just keep it, like, clean down there.  Yeah.  Crazy Jim turned me on to that years ago at AAF. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  Probably shouldn't have that part.  I know.  But let's.  Sounds like, you know, here, let me help you out with that.  Let these fuckers think what they want.  Straight razor, some cream.  Let me cream you up.  This crazy Jim, he was not shy about this stuff, and he said how great it was on our  show one day, and I went, hmm, that's interesting.  I'm going to try this.  Guys will say it's gay, but the chicks will dig it.  What's the benefit out of it?  Like, so it just doesn't.  The girls like it for some reason.  Even above.  Do you do the patch of bow so you're, like, bald, like, you know.  Shave it like a stripper. 
[01:25:00]  Honestly, this is where, you know, because everyone has their line, because I think Norton  does this.  When you're shaving above the thing, that is, like, uber gay.  But to keep everything nice and then trim down the ball hair or take it off.  Do you keep it under control above?  Yeah, of course.  But he's talking about just completely shaving it.  Yeah, I mean, after you get crabs, you've got to shave it.  One time I was, I live with this girl, Stacey, when I lived with Stacey, I was going down  on her, and I see this little thing crawling, I'm going, oh, this bitch had crabs, and 
[01:25:30]  I was living with her, so that means, you know, ugh, you never had crabs.  Never, ever, ever had crabs.  No, everyone hasn't had crabs, Rich.  No, I've never had crabs.  You've never had crabs or scabies or anything?  In the room, anyone, crabs?  Crabs, anyone?  No?  No, man.  I mean, I never got them either, but a lot of people.  Yeah, sure.  How about, uh...  If you're eating a girl with crabs, you've got the crabs.  No, I saw one little crawly.  So you got them.  Oh, this was years ago, when I was, you know, like 21.  I got mice, but I don't have crabs. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, mice.  And everyone's a while, a cockroach, but, uh...  Yeah, that's not you.  How about, do you ever have, like, a gonorrhea or any of that shit?  Nope.  Can't get anything past you today, huh, Rich?  Oh.  Never had an STD.  Really?  Nope.  Good for you.  Same here.  Oh, I...  Why are you looking at us like you're in shock?  There are people that don't get them.  Back in the day, I mean...  Well, see, I'm older.  I'm lucky.  See, I'm older. 
[01:26:30]  I mean, so we were banging...  Before AIDS, we were banging without rubbers, you know.  I mean, once AIDS came, you always wore a rubber.  But before then, you know, you just...  You know, you go to the bar and, you know...  Pick up some whore.  With crabs.  It was horrible.  Just...  Anyway, did you finish up with the girl after you're going down on her and you see a crab  up close?  I...  You have to...  Like, right there, face to face with a crab.  Hi, Rich.  And then do you finish up?  Or do you just say, fuck this, leave?  Yeah, you just...  Well, no, we live together. 
[01:27:00]  She caught him from...  The roommate, the other girl, brought him in.  She got it off the toilet seat.  And we...  I live with her.  That's always the way.  Yeah.  The toilet seat, which has never happened either.  No, I don't think the toilet seat transmits diseases at all.  No, crabs, not diseases.  I don't think...  I don't think it transmits anything.  No.  I really don't.  I sit right down, man.  I've never used one of those fucking paper things.  In a public thing, you sit right down?  You wouldn't even clean it off?  You clean it off.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's times I'll at least wipe down, but...  Yeah.  There are times I don't even wipe down. 
[01:27:30]  If you see piss on there, you go to another stall.  Oh, no, I'll just wipe that off.  Really?  I mean, I've never had a problem whatsoever.  Why are you drooling on yourself?  Because I'm thinking about...  It's disgusting, like...  I just sit right down.  Like a man's man.  You just open that stall and you sit right down.  Take a seat.  You don't take that little cute little paper fucking cover out of the thing.  You're not sitting there eating cake, my friend.  I'll take a little...  You're taking a shit.  I'll take a little look.  Sure, I'll take a look and say, 
[01:28:00]  All right, well, I gotta wipe this up a little bit before I sit down.  But that's about it.  I'm not taking those freaking paper things.  No.  No.  I've never used a paper thing.  Someone the other day was talking on this show about building a nest.  I don't build nests.  None of that shit.  I just sit down, do what I have to do, and get the hell out of there.  You are a...  You're out of control.  You're crazy.  Get the hell out of there.  I clean off, man.  I don't put the paper down.  And I rarely, rarely clean my hands after I take a leak.  Well, that...  You know, you gotta...  Rarely.  And it comes up here, because we run, you know, during breaks to take leaks and stuff, 
[01:28:30]  and every once in a while, we'll have a guest or a fellow comedian, and they're like,  Dude, you don't wash your hands after you take a leak?  I'm like, no.  No.  This part is the cleanest part on your body.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Your hands are so much dirtier than your dick.  Yeah, but...  Guaranteed.  Yeah, but put it this way.  If you're touching the door handle, and I gotta touch it, I'm touching the same stuff  you're touching with your hands that make your hands dirty.  You've been doing it for over ten years.  I know.  And what has happened?  By proxy.  What has happened?  Nobody washes it.  What has happened?  Every time I open the door. 
[01:29:00]  Nothing has happened.  No, it's just kind of gross.  It's all paranoia.  Which I don't know it can't hurt you.  It has nothing to do with you think you're gonna catch anything.  But it's so ridiculous people go, I can't believe you don't wash your hands after you  take a leak.  It's the cleanest part on your body, I think.  Nobody washes it.  I mean, you don't have to wash your hands unless you work in a restaurant.  Who cares?  I mean...  Right.  The other remedy, because I had two, when I would go out to my grandma's beach house.  What are you getting there?  I just need more water.  Oh.  When I would go out to my grandma's beach house in Waiting River on Long Island, and my parents 
[01:29:30]  just didn't believe in suntan lotion at all.  They would believe in it?  Well, it might have been...  It exists.  Look.  It might have been another one of those, you know, you have seven kids, you gotta kind  of like, you know...  Yeah.  Cut corners.  You gotta cut corners.  And that's brilliant to cut corners on sunscreen for your fucking kids.  Margarine.  Holy crap.  Nothing.  And look how white I am.  Yeah.  And then, stupid me, I would like lay down like this with my hands behind my head. 
[01:30:00]  The most tender part of my little Lopi's arms.  Oh, so I would get the really red sunburn on my underarms and this, you know, this skin  over here.  Just burnt to a crisp.  As red as red could be.  And then, I tell the story all the time.  It's the truth.  But then, we'd sleep over at my grandma's house in army cots.  I don't know why she had army cots, but she had many army cots in her beach house.  Those are comfy material.  Burlap.  Yeah.  Army surplus burlap.  And then, wool blankets.  And it's the middle of summer.  I swear to God. 
[01:30:30]  It's like sandpaper.  I don't know...  To this day, I don't know why we had wool blankets at my grandma's house.  I don't know why.  And I don't know why not one uncle or aunt or my mom or my dad looked at my grandma  and said, you know, wool blankets stink.  They're absolutely awful.  Yeah.  They hurt.  And then, you know, I'll have an aunt or something and I'll say, you should be thankful you had  a nice childhood.  Blah, blah, blah.  But the wool blankets, after having a really bad sunburn on the beach, and of course, no  one really tidied up, so you're already sleeping in an army cot that has sand in it. 
[01:31:00]  And then, you've got the wool blanket, and it's like, you know, July and August where  it's 90 degrees at night, and you're sitting there suffering with sunburn.  Comfy.  So, I'd go to my dad and beg, I need some relief here.  Help me out.  What the hell?  This sunburn is killing me.  So, his home remedy was vinegar.  After the sunburn?  Oh, yeah.  He would rub it on my body.  Vinegar.  What would that...  It did absolutely...  What would it do?  It was supposed to take the sting.  Make you stink. 
[01:31:30]  It was supposed to take the sting out of the sunburn, but yes, Anthony, it just made me stink.  Like vinegar.  But that was his home remedy for that.  It's not like a salad.  He had two home remedies, the athlete foot thing and the sunburned vinegar thing.  Neither of which worked.  No, not at all.  Absolutely not.  A wool blanket.  That's tough.  I swear to God.  I mean...  People, you know, these stories come up every once in a while.  People don't believe it.  They think I'm making it up.  I've got to get my cousins in here and my brothers.  That's tough.  I mean, after laying on the beach all day...  I had a lot of...  I mean, some kids in some countries, you know, live in huts on the ground and you've got 
[01:32:00]  to deal with a wool blanket.  That's really...  That's a tough life.  It's America.  You're a kid.  You want to...  You don't want to sleep in an army cot, Rich.  You know how awful a wool blanket is?  Even on a nice winter day?  I don't even think they use that in the army now.  That's what I'm saying.  The...  The cots got to be the worst.  It was awful.  Or you'd have to share a bed with, like, two of your brothers, you know?  It was weird.  It's one of those cots where if you turn the wrong way, your thigh gets pinched where it  folds.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Like those old reclining things that were out by the pool when you were a kid, the metal  ones, and your thigh used to get pinched in the point where the chair would bend.  And we would all hang out with my grandma for the weekend, you know, and the uncles and  aunts would leave and my mom and dad would leave and, you know, so now my grandma has  to feed all of us, you know, all my brothers and sisters and a lot of my cousins, so she'd  just get the Wonder Bread out, spread it.  This is a true story.  Spread it out on the table, get the tub of margarine. 
[01:33:00]  Was it Wonder Bread, though?  Oh, yeah.  Well, or...  Yeah, I think so.  I think they splurged for the Wonder Bread.  And then they would get a tub of margarine, not butter, spread the margarine on all the  bread, and then she would break out the sugar.  This is a true story.  I love that stuff.  That was great.  Oh, God.  When I tell this shit, people are like, there's no fucking way.  Of course.  You used to have butter and sugar sandwiches.  You had them, too?  Yes, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Margarine.  Margarine, though.  Ours was just butter or whatever.  Margarine.  We couldn't afford butter, really. 
[01:33:30]  No way.  Not for all those kids.  I mean, we weren't poor, but the problem...  Was that stuff just called spread?  You don't know what it is?  I guess we were poor.  I'm trying to figure this out.  I think we were...  It was more that we had so many kids that the money didn't go around as much as other families.  Yeah, if you had, like, two kids in your family, it would probably be rich.  Yeah.  So then she would take the spoon out with the sugar and just, you know, margarine and sugar  sandwiches.  That's great.  On a hot summer day. 
[01:34:00]  Smelling like vinegar.  Yeah.  Sunburned little vinegar kid with soap between their toes and running around on a sugar high.  And every time I'd get together with, you know, the extended family for the holidays,  you know, these stories come up.  Oh, I heard you on the radio talking about the margarine and sugar sandwiches.  And then they would go, but wasn't it just great?  Ah, the days.  And I'm saying, no, it wasn't great.  A bologna sandwich every once in a while would have been nice.  Some type of meat.  And bologna was the lowest form of meat, too.  They were like...  We used to go get half subs and whatever, and bologna was like 40 cents. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  And we were poor, too.  My mother would fry the bologna, give us fried bologna sandwiches.  I'm going to puke.  Fried bologna.  Fried bologna, because it was like...  A little cheese, right?  Yeah, it was like a low man's pork roll.  We got the cheap cheese, though.  I swear to God, we got what amounts to government cheese.  Yeah, the brick.  I hated cheese until, I don't know, I think I hated cheese until, like, college.  Because then I finally had a real piece of cheese and went, this is how this shit's supposed  to taste? 
[01:35:00]  Holy crap!  My grandmother was an embarrassment, though, because I would play...  I lived...  You know, the whole street was a black neighborhood.  Yeah.  And, you know, there were ruthless little kids.  And then right when the streetlights came on, my grandmother would come walking down the  street with her stockings down to her ankle in a nightgown, yelling for me and my  brother to come in, you know, and her teeth falling out of her mouth, her faith, and  it was just a total nightmare.  Because I lived above my grand...  We lived for free.  My grandparents owned the house.  And my mother had no money, too. 
[01:35:30]  So we lived for free on the second floor.  So we basically had to listen to my grandparents and my...  You know what I mean?  It just sucked living above...  You know, them telling me what to do, and fuck you, you know what I mean?  Nice childhood.  Oh, it sucked.  It just ruined everything.  My grandfather was a compulsive gambler, which, you know...  No, you know, I liked my upbringing, but there was some weird crap that went on.  Powdered milk?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Powdered milk.  We couldn't afford all that milk for seven kids. 
[01:36:00]  Are you kidding me?  You know how much milk you would go through in a week for seven kids growing up?  Wasn't that just like water and like paste?  It was actual powder.  Yeah.  I've never had powder.  You know, right?  I don't know.  It's the most disgusting thing you could drink.  That's how we got our milk nutrition.  Every once in a while, you go to a friend's house and...  Is the milk nutrition in there?  Who knows, but...  It's taken out in the powdering process.  Every once in a while, you go to a friend's house and get a real glass of milk.  Oh, my God.  That was like...  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:30]  It was like heaven.  Did you ever have that Underwood Devil ham crap?  Like, it was like a...  Who knows what it was, but it was like...  Oh, yeah.  I know what you're talking about.  It was like a spray...  It was like spam.  My mom would get the cold cuts that no one else would buy.  The stuff that had like the olives in it and all that crap.  Olive loaf.  Or whatever it was.  Like ham with like olives.  Olive loaf.  All those vegetables no one eats.  Like they decide to make it and throw it into meat for some reason.  Oh, yeah.  And the cupboard was all products that were...  I think they were called no frills back then?  Yeah.  Where it was a white box with just like one word on it. 
[01:37:00]  Or whatever it was.  Kind of like that old movie Repo Man when they went in and got beer.  Yeah.  But in my house, that's what every single item in the cupboard.  It was just in a white package.  Yeah.  Black writing, whatever.  And they would always try to make believe it was like Captain Crunch, but they had another  weird name for it.  Like it would just say Crunch.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  Oh, yeah.  The no frills brands of all the popular brands that everyone else was eating.  We used to go in when we finally got apartments, me and my friends, and this was before they 
[01:37:30]  had scanners.  We used to go to the supermarket and just switch the prices.  You'd peel the labels off.  Uh-huh.  And we would just put the other price on it.  I mean, we'd walk out with king crab meat, you know, for like, you know, 80 cents or whatever.  And we'd just switch everything and steal and do whatever we could as criminals.  Well, just growing up, you knew.  Let's go to the phones because a lot of people are saying that you said another word wrong  today.  Jason, go ahead.  Yeah, boss fucked up twice again.  All right.  Go ahead.  He said, uh, gondorrhea for gonorrhea and low man's pork roll for poor man's pork roll. 
[01:38:00]  Wait, gondorrhea instead of gonorrhea.  Okay.  What was the other one?  Low man's pork roll for poor man's pork roll.  No, I should go low.  All right.  All right.  Watch it now.  We're keeping track.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Joey.  Joey, you're next on the Opie and Anthony program.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Joey.  Hey, I had the powdered milk myself and the vinegar treatment.  It was the same exact thing.  I loved it growing up.  Hey, one thing I've got is a world record for yambag hair. 
[01:38:30]  You guys talking about shaving.  Yeah.  I was at a Ben Franklin.  I was down there cleaning myself up.  I pull it out, and there it is.  Thirteen and a half inches long.  A ball bag hair, thirteen and a half inches long?  It must have gone unnoticed.  And I took a piece of paper out from the desk at the Ben Franklin, and I measured it across  diagonally.  Yeah.  And I said, this has got to be a record.  So I left it in the drawer for housekeeping, and I checked out the next morning.  It's really thirteen and a half inches long?  Yeah.  You take a piece of eight and a half by eleven paper, and that's how I measured it. 
[01:39:00]  I had no tape measure.  So I stretched it out, and there it was.  I couldn't believe it.  Wow.  I was calling everybody.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, boys.  Let's go to Westside Doug.  Westside Doug, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I was talking about waxing my ball bag.  Makes your mule look bigger.  And I'm not gay or anything, but...  Does it or above?  If you, like, shave above?  No, you got to shave the tree.  What do you mean?  If you see a tree out, like, in a park, and it has bushes around it, but then you take 
[01:39:30]  the bushes...  Oh, it looks taller.  Oh, it looks a lot taller.  So you got to, like, shave around the shaft.  Oh, you could cheat.  You could cheat.  Give yourself the appearance of at least two more.  Really?  Really?  That much?  Well, maybe a slight exaggeration, but you could definitely...  A lot of hair.  You could definitely...  A lot of brush.  You know, in the schoolyard around the trees, like, there's no grass at all.  They have this circle of dirt.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what you got to do.  Put some brickwork around it.  Well, suddenly, like, wow, that's an impressive tree.  It's all about the maintenance, boys.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  The maintenance.  I got to punch you now.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Crab story.  Yeah, we got...  The phones are lit, so we'll take a break, and we'll continue with the phone calls.  My throat is freaking killing me as the show continues.  You need some of that stuff.  I need the...  How do you get that?  I need that, yeah, the Uber penicillin.  What the hell is it called?  Zithromax.  What is it?  Zithromax.  Yeah, yeah, that's the stuff.  I am Zithromax.  That's the stuff that kicks it right out of me.  I got to figure that out, because... 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Like, when I got here at six, and I said, dude, I'm not feeling it today, it's like five  times worse right now.  It is just...  Is it scratchy?  Drying up, scratchy.  You getting the drip in the back?  No.  Does it feel like you have a big ball of snot there that won't go down?  No, no, it's just all about the throat.  That's the worst, when you're trying to swallow something, and then you realize there's nothing  there.  I'm just getting sick.  It's just feeling really, really dry.  What is that?  Really, really scratchy.  Theraflu?  Theraflu?  Does it make you drowsy? 
[01:41:00]  I think that puts you out, though, right?  Does it?  What does it say?  Let's see.  Do not operate heavy machinery?  Where's the warning on the Theraflu?  Microphones.  Overdose warning.  Warning.  No.  Warning.  Danger.  Other information?  Help me out, Anthony.  I'm looking.  I don't see that it's drowsy.  Do not use more than directed.  Avoid alcohol.  Drowsiness may occur.  Oh, where?  Where's that?  Top. 
[01:41:30]  First thing, be careful when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.  Where the hell?  Excitability may occur, especially in children.  Oh, okay.  I see it.  There you go.  All right.  I've got to wait until after the show.  You don't even have to put this in.  You can just snort it.  I've got to wait until after the show.  What, are you supposed to put it in hot water and drink it like tea?  Yeah.  Just drink it like tea.  Bullshit.  Cetaminophen.  This type of stuff, you throw it in water and just slam it and get it over with.  You've got to get the penicillin.  Yeah, I've got to call my doctor today.  Or maybe some will just mysteriously show up at the front door of the station today. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, is that it?  The sooner I get it in, the better I'll be.  All right.  We'll do this, and then we'll come back and do a little more.  David and Anthony Famous get infected.  Why do they eat one of those guys?  Why do they report radio in the newspaper?  Huh?  I don't even know why they report radio in the newspaper.  I don't know.  It's got to just be thankless to be the radio reporter.  You walk around in the Daily News building or the Post building, and you're like, there  he goes, the radio reporter. 
[01:42:30]  You know, they're just like looking at him going, this guy is like one more technological  jump close to unemployment.  Like, they're just not going to report on it anymore.  Who's lower?  Radio guy or crossword puzzle guy?  Does he even, is there even a guy?  Or the bridge guy?  You know, the guy that like writes the bridge column?  Right.  Oh, queen to your left?  Or, like, I don't even understand the game.  And that's like a horrible, these are, can't you put ads in those spaces and make a little 
[01:43:00]  money?  I've been thinking about that for years, you know, reading the newspaper every day.  There's so much shit in here.  And you've got to think, you know, you're looking for an audience for all this stuff.  Yeah.  How many people are reading the queen left bridge?  Let me think.  I'm buying the paper.  Just throw the rest away.  Give me the bridge page, because I've got to know what to do if I just drew a king,  jack, queen.  Bridge. 
[01:43:30]  What fucking year is this?  What century is this?  Bridge.  Hmm.  Unbelievable that they still have the bridge.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  And I read Gridlock Sam all the time.  Gridlock Sam.  Gridlock Sam.  Sam Schwartz.  My God.  He lets you know where the traffic is.  Okay.  Dude, when is the paper printed?  Is this guy a fucking psychic?  Wouldn't he be better to tell you what the lotto numbers are going to be than where traffic  might be in the morning when the fucking paper comes out? 
[01:44:00]  I predict a tractor trailer jackknife on the FDR.  But it's Gridlock Sam.  It's Sam Schwartz, and he knows everything.  He certainly does.  Why would you put a traffic reporter in the newspaper?  What, are you reading this while you're driving?  You have the folded up paper?  Hey, what's this accident?  It doesn't say anything about this in the paper.  What a dope.  Gridlock Sam says I should avoid...  Oh, he was right.  Fucking crit.  This Sam is great. 
[01:44:30]  I'm going to get on the park.  No, I'm not.  And Sam said I shouldn't.  Traffic in the paper.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you. 
[01:45:00]  There is only me.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  I don't know if I'm going to make it to the end of the show.  Oh, come on.  My throat in the last hour.  Unbelievable.  Every freaking year I get this thing.  Yeah.  And I think I got it from my brother.  And I was paranoid when I saw my brother, but...  But, you know, we're opening up that restaurant in Huntington. 
[01:45:30]  Yep.  It's going well.  He decided to pretty much redo the entire inside.  So, when do you think...  We were hoping to be open by now, but it's going to take a little more time.  I hope a lot of the fans come and check out the restaurant when we're open.  You going to be a restaurant owner?  Well, I'm a silent partner.  Who am I kidding?  What type of food?  What I know about restaurants is this.  I go out to eat twice a day.  I go out to eat...  Twice a day.  I go out to eat at least ten times a week.  At least.  Wow.  So, I know that part of the business.  No cooking done in your house? 
[01:46:00]  I'm attempting that more and more.  Not just talking about oatmeal.  I'm really getting bored with going out to restaurants.  Yeah.  Because I do it just to get a meal in me, but every place you go and eat, they want to  do the entire thing with you, the service and the...  You just want to get in and eat.  I want to get in and...  Yeah, exactly.  But in my neighborhood, they're trained now.  They understand when I'm coming.  Yeah.  They understand to get the food out immediately.  And throw the bill on my table immediately.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Because it's all about just getting, you know, lunch in and going home.  It's New York.  They're used to that.  Not really.  No.  Because they want to give you the whole presentation.  So they should get the big tip.  But they finally realize, wow, this guy's in here, you know, pretty much every day for  the same, you know, food.  Yeah.  So they're getting it finally.  But I went to check out the progress on the restaurant.  My brother's working like an animal there in Huntington.  It's going to be a great place.  And he warned me.  He said, man, I'm not feeling right.  My throat's a little weird.  Uh-oh.  I'm like, oh, how bad could it be? 
[01:47:00]  So I showed up and I didn't get anywhere near him.  Mm-hmm.  But still, maybe that's what did it.  Could be.  Because now I'm just feeling it.  Okay.  Anthony, holiday season upon us.  Yes.  Actually, I was shopping at the mall over the weekend and they were playing Christmas music  already.  Already?  What is that about?  They said that this morning they have Christmas lights across the street in front of Route 57.  Really?  Steve and I were looking at this morning.  It's November 8th. 
[01:47:30]  What is that about?  When we were growing up, Christmas started right after Thanksgiving, obviously.  Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Yep.  There's Santa to end the parade.  And it starts Christmas.  Holiday season is finally here.  Christmas season is finally here.  But I was in the mall and I actually said it out loud and a bunch of shoppers started laughing.  I'm like, fucking Christmas music already?  And everyone started laughing because they were thinking the same thing.  And I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  But now there's stories on the news and stuff about the Christmas trees and the decorations 
[01:48:00]  and this and that.  Yeah.  And in the radio world, they're all wondering what radio station is going to go all Christmas  music.  All Christmas music this season.  What station is going to be the first one to do it this year?  First one to change format for Christmas.  What station where they don't want anybody to listen to them?  And they wonder why all the stories on TV are about satellite radio and not about regular  radio.  That's their big idea every year.  Wow.  We'll turn our radio station into Christmas music 24 hours a day. 
[01:48:30]  That'll get the people listening.  So anyway, we caught this little story on the news this morning.  Washington, D.C. got their Christmas tree ready.  Or it's on the way.  And then what we want you to listen to here is the wacky news reader with her wacky comment  about the story.  Yeah.  We want to start playing more of these because these guys try to, you know, improv on the  spot when all they are are news readers. 
[01:49:00]  They got a monitor in front of them and they know exactly what they're supposed to say.  But every once in a while, these people try to take a take a chance and say something  off the cuff.  And this is what was said this morning.  Washington, D.C. is getting a new addition.  The Capitol Christmas tree is on its way from the Santa Fe National Forest.  The annual cutting took place yesterday.  The spruce weighs 8,000 pounds and is 83 feet tall.  It'll take approximately 14,000 lights and ornaments to decorate it.  It's the second time a Capitol Christmas tree was chosen from New Mexico. 
[01:49:30]  Can you imagine trying to get that one into the Christmas tree stand while arguing with  your husband about whether it's great or not?  Not that I have any personal experience with that.  It sounds like you might have.  You'll have to get Rob's side of the story, too.  Everybody can relate to that, I suppose.  Everybody who gets a treat.  She bombed in that.  Guys, that's what we do in the studio.  When something bombs, you go, well, just saying.  I mean, everyone can relate to that, right?  That's true.  She probably had blank stares in her face. 
[01:50:00]  Of course.  Can you imagine?  Imagine putting you in a wood chipper, you stupid, unfunny bitch.  Just read.  You're there to read and look good.  Shut up.  Don't ad lib.  Stop it.  And she probably had, oh, she couldn't wait to get that one out, too.  Like, this is me, the one that puts me over the top.  Happy with her line.  Yeah.  Another big story today.  Howard Stern cannot wait to move to satellite radio.  In fact, he talks about it pretty much all the time.  The promotions are not making his current bosses at all happy. 
[01:50:30]  And, in fact, they're keeping him off the air this morning.  Fox 5's Lisa Evers is in Midtown with a story.  This is another promotional stunt.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it.  We have people deep inside of Finney.  And the fact is, Howard was taking today off.  Yeah.  But the news crews bit.  They bit.  So they're all talking about how he got suspended. 
[01:51:00]  Bullshit.  Of course it is.  Absolute bullshit.  It's a stunt.  He had the day off.  Penciled.  Penciled in already.  All radio guys have done this over the years.  Actually, I don't think we ever did a fake suspension, did we?  No.  You guys have too many real ones.  I know.  People thought we did.  Yeah, but we were getting suspended so many times.  People were like, these are fake, right?  It's got to be.  Uh, no.  Eventually they fire these guys.  They wouldn't just keep suspending them, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Especially in Boston.  Listen, we got suspended.  I can't even tell you how many times we got suspended.  They didn't know what to do with us.  They just kept suspending us.  And then stupid us, because we're like anyone else out there.  You know, less work is good, right?  More gooder.  And we realized they weren't going to fire us back in the day.  That's before radio changed and they really started firing popular DJs for doing dumb  things.  But there was a time you could get away with murder because you were bringing in the ratings  for the station.  As long as the ratings were there. 
[01:52:00]  So Matt and I, our eyebrows would go up like, wait a minute.  Every once in a while we could, you know, do something stupid, get suspended, get a few  days off and go play golf or do whatever.  Hello?  What's going on?  Pookie?  Yes.  Hi.  I know.  Um, yeah.  Oh, I'm on the air right now.  I'm doing a radio show.  It's my job. 
[01:52:30]  What is it?  The body shop.  Can you get my door?  Mm-hmm.  This is great.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's another body shop stunt.  Yeah.  Well, I'll take this time to spray the old age.  Right.  How many?  Okay.  Well, I'll call you afternoon, let's say.  All right. 
[01:53:00]  Now I can talk for another three minutes.  I'll check my voicemail.  The wheels.  Thank you.  The wheels are falling off this one today, man.  The wheels are just...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What the hell's going on?  I've had a problem with the Cadillac, the SRX.  Wow.  It took a hit to the door in a parking lot, and they have to replace the door.  Mm-hmm.  Apparently there's no Cadillac SRX doors in the country.  The whole country.  Nothing.  None.  Ah, so you're going to have to get like one of those other doors.  No, I don't want another door. 
[01:53:30]  That doesn't match the car?  No.  You're going to have like an orange door, and it's a black car you got?  Isn't your car blue?  I love when I see that on the highway.  Yeah.  Isn't the SRX a new car?  Yeah.  Well, couldn't you call Cadillac?  You know, I mean...  No, that's not what I'm going to have to do.  I said, can you have an extra door kicking around?  Yeah.  Say hi to Craig in New Jersey.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Craig.  Listen, just driving in this morning to New York City, it was soon as you get up the  turnpike by 495, which is a major, you know, travel route. 
[01:54:00]  There's a picture of you, two knuckleheads up on the billboard.  Oh, really?  Nice.  Yeah, nice exposure there.  I heard they were going to promote us in the month of November, so I guess it's starting  to happen, because we were talking earlier that we're in the latest issue of Rolling  Stone Magazine with a pretty nice-sized ad, and got some billboards on Long Island, now  a billboard on the turnpike in Jersey.  All right.  Great shot, guys.  Good job.  Keep up your work.  Thank you, sir.  Take care, guys.  Good to hear.  All right, we'll move on to other things here today.  There are women out there saving themselves for marriage. 
[01:54:30]  Do we have the technical virgin spots there, Eric?  Can you find those for me?  They did a story on Good Morning America, teens saving themselves for marriage.  When it comes to sex, 19-year-old Shelby Knox has decided to wait.  I think that purity, not having sex before marriage, is an important personal decision.  When I was 15, I took a pledge to remain pure, sexually pure, until marriage.  That was four years ago, and I have remained sexually pure. 
[01:55:00]  15-year-old Annalise Wurch feels the same way.  To me, living a pure lifestyle means stay away from things that could possibly harm my  body, or to me, are morally wrong.  Things such as smoking, excessive alcohol, drugs, or premarital sex.  For Generation Weaned on Jessica Simpson vowing her virginity until marriage, many teens  today are joining a growing trend called Generation Pure in this month's Seventeen magazine.  I don't want to do illegal drugs.  I don't drink to the point of getting drunk. 
[01:55:30]  When I have sex with someone, it will be with someone I love and not some random person  I met at a frat party.  That's wonderful.  Great.  I started my life down the old Christian road myself there.  You did, did you?  Oh, they were attempting to get me to join the team there.  Yeah.  Join the cult.  I was just talking about this over the weekend.  I almost went to Catholic high school and all that crap.  Ooh.  Went to religion class every Tuesday night.  Priesthood?  Nah, nothing like that. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know, man.  The sex thing?  Yeah.  I think sex is obviously a very important part of your life.  Yeah.  And it's great that these women want to wait and you hear guys that want to wait.  What if you marry one of these people and they just suck in bed?  Then you're stuck.  Yeah, true.  You need to test drive a little.  I was going to say, the old joke, you got to test drive what you're getting.  Yeah, but if you both wait, then you both might suck, so you don't know what good is good.  You know what I mean? 
[01:56:30]  But these girls that wait at 15 or 17, they're still letting you, you know, they're still  giving head.  That's what they're saying.  They say a lot of girls remaining a virgin are still giving head and anal.  How about that?  Yeah.  Saving the vag, but they're just chewing up that ass.  Well, if a husband wants to flip them over and it's just, what the hell happened back  here?  Jesus.  It was a train wreck.  But I saved my vag for you.  So, great.  Can we push some of this back in, though? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Would you rather know that, like, your girlfriend, would you rather know that she slept with four  other guys or four other guys sodomized her?  Yeah.  You know, I mean, it's not.  In the ass.  In the ass.  Ew.  But sex is so important.  I don't really, that would be a scary thing to marry a virgin, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Shelby says she does not judge others, but in the 17th survey, 48% of teens think it  is not okay for anyone to have sex before marriage, and 38% do not think condoms should 
[01:57:30]  be available without parents okay.  But for many teens, abstaining from sex is about religion, too.  I am a Christian who hasn't been for the past 10 years.  I have made the decision to stay abstinent until married.  82% say that religion plays a significant part in their lives, and 80% pray regularly.  I don't go to church.  I consider myself a very liberal Christian.  With people who are more conservative, I do get you're going to hell.  I do think of myself as a practicing Christian. 
[01:58:00]  I pray.  I rely on God for guidance, and I read the Bible.  So, I think that that is really the core of it.  So, it's a religious thing, I guess, huh?  Hey, Anthony, you need a new Cadillac door?  Of course.  Actually, I'm pissed off at this guy right here, Bob in New York.  Go ahead, Bob.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  I can get you a door.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  When do you need it?  What color? 
[01:58:30]  What year?  Everything.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I bet you can.  I sent my guy out tonight.  You'll have it tomorrow.  Yeah, thanks.  I'll go the legit way.  No, this is okay.  Why don't someone just drop the door on the front stoop tomorrow morning, Anthony?  In front of the station?  In front of the station?  Yeah.  No problem.  I'll give it to, you know, your bodyguard out there.  I'll leave it right in front.  Yeah, what color?  What color, just in case?  It's blue.  Dark blue?  Yeah, dark blue.  Dark blue?  No problem.  I can have it there tomorrow morning.  What's the official color? 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  Like, there's forest green and all that crap.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sure it's some fancy schmancy color.  All you need is the color, the model, and I'll have it there tomorrow for you.  Great.  Thank you, but let me go through these guys for a little longer.  Can you get penicillin?  That's what I was...  Thank you, boss.  Can you get penicillin within an hour?  I couldn't make the hint any clearer.  I need the stupid six-pack of penicillin, the super penicillin, so I can continue doing  this radio show for the rest of the week, or we're going into dumb worst-of mode with 
[01:59:30]  stupid bits that you've heard a million times.  Get me my penicillin.  No penicillin, but I can get your car door.  That's hilarious.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Bruce.  Hey, Bruce.  Hey, I was just wondering, man.  Don't you think you'd rather the wife save the ass for you instead of the damn vag?  Of course.  That's more successful.  I mean, obviously.  And one more thing.  Happy birthday, not Jimmy.  Yeah, the birthday thing, I think, is finally...  Finally winding down.  Finally winding down.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:00:00]  Kind of like that Pat Battle thing that was going on for a while.  Hey, remember that?  That just went away.  That's what happens.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Morning, boys.  Morning, Eric.  My wife was a virgin until one month before we got married, and she was 31 when we got married.  Wow.  Oh, how was it?  Let's just put it this way.  We've been married nine years, and I'm seriously contemplating a divorce.  Oh, wow.  And the sex life is part of it.  All right, wait.  So she was a virgin her entire life, and a month before you got married, she decided to give in? 
[02:00:30]  Yes.  That's a little weird.  You would think she would go the distance at that point.  Yeah.  That's like running the New York City Marathon, and then you can see the finish line, and then you're like, nah.  Fuck it.  Who needs to go the distance?  And you know the worst part about it is she told me, she said, well, you know so much about sex, you'll have to teach me everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Sure.  I haven't had a blow job in eight years.  Did you try to teach her?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  And she gave up.  She's like, oh, I'm not interested in anal sex.  Yeah, right.  If I even say nice ass, she's like, leave my ass alone.  Oh, boy.  See?  See what happens?  Yeah, you got to test drive.  You got to see what you're getting yourself into.  What's the biggest thing you've ever had in your ass?  Like, do you guys like fingers?  Do you like a finger or something in your ass?  Well, I mean, boss, we know you take a-  We know you take the ass for drugs, but-  I want nothing.  You don't want even, like, the tip of a fingertip in your ass?  No, boss, we could do homo hour with you if you'd like for the last hour, and then I will just go home. 
[02:01:30]  That's not homo hour.  It is.  You shouldn't have anything by your ass.  If you want, we could take phone calls, and you could ask these fine listeners of ours.  I should have taken a dump last break.  Why?  It is, I am, like, dying over here.  You guys?  You picked the wrong game.  Wow, you guys are a fucking mess.  It happens every once in a while.  I know.  If you do this on a regular basis, every once in a while, there's going to be a day where both of us are out. 
[02:02:00]  I'm feeling it.  Now, there are many days where I'm so gone, sorry, and funny, or in another world, but then the other guy steps up and takes over.  But today, we're both hurting bad.  I swear I am going to have to go into the bathroom.  Get out of here.  You're getting the cramps.  You're getting where the cramps are.  It just started.  Yeah, the back of the thighs, I'm feeling it.  The pain in your keel over.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, ugh. 
[02:02:30]  I had that when I was a kid.  I was running home.  You know, you could feel it.  I got, like, a block to go.  And then I get to my house, and I run up to, and I couldn't open my pants.  Yeah.  The second I, all over.  Dude, I forgot to tell you guys.  I actually puked over the weekend.  Oh.  Remember I told you I went to my nephew's football game?  Uh-huh.  This football thing is the greatest thing ever.  I watched my nephew play football, seven years old.  It's insane.  If you want real energy, that's what they should throw on TV. 
[02:03:00]  That's what they should.  Seven-year-old football.  Just seven-year-olds playing football.  They're running out of the game, bleeding, crying, looking for their mommies.  And I'm sitting on the sideline like, this is insane.  And it's real injuries.  It's not like, you know, like seven-year-olds being seven-year-olds.  This is real shit.  You see kids getting smeared, open field tackles, because there's one guy that knows what he's  doing, just killing the kids.  They're coming off with all sorts of injuries.  I'm like, wow, this is the greatest thing ever.  But anyway, I go into the port-a-potty. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Because I have to take a leak, whatever.  I don't know what it is, but seven-year-old dumps, holy crap.  I actually started getting sick.  Full of Cheerios.  I started dry heaving.  The smell.  Look, no one enjoys, you know, the smell of crap to begin with.  I understand that.  And, you know.  But a seven-year-old, and they're just piling on top of each other in the freaking port-a-potty.  Oh, my God.  Car chase on Fox?  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Let's go to Fox.  I don't know.  Somebody was saying.  Yeah, there it is.  But you have to take a dump, Anthony.  Oh, dude, it's banging.  Yeah?  Where's this car chase?  West Virginia State Trooper.  No, a former West Virginia State Trooper is on the phone.  Is this a K station?  So that's west of the Mississippi, right?  I can relate to this guy if he's got to take a dump.  California.  Because I would just be running from the cops, too.  California.  How long it takes to get booked and everything, and you just know there's going to be hours 
[02:04:30]  before you take a dump.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy?  Yo, I used to work for a Caddy Chevy dealership in East Flatbush in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  And I used to have the Hasidic Jew come in to buy Caddy's, and the color that Anthony has  is blue chip.  And it's an old Jewish man color.  So now I know you've got to be old.  And now I'm on the borderline of part Jewish, because you've got an old heat color.  It's horrible.  Blue chip.  Blue chip.  Black raisin. 
[02:05:00]  White diamond dead blue chip.  What are you, I'm crying?  Punch it out.  Guy's insulting the color.  Now they're giving Jews colors.  It's a Jew color.  I didn't even know.  You did have a car that was cherry colored once, I remember.  Was it the...  Was it like cherry red?  The Pathfinder.  It was Candy Apple, I think.  I don't know what it was.  Burgundy.  It was Burgundy.  Candy Apple.  And no, the door color I'm looking for is in Periwinkle.  It's Candy Apple. 
[02:05:30]  That's very good.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Mike!  Hey, how you boys doing?  We've been better, Mike.  Yeah, it sounds like that.  Opie, Dayquil.  That's all I've got to say.  What?  Dayquil.  I don't...  I mean, I can suffer through it, but the fact is, the throat just really hurts.  That'll make you feel better.  Always works for me.  I'm going to knock myself out for the day as soon as this show's over.  Southern California, car chase.  All right, Mike.  Estimated 80 miles an hour.  There's nothing about that virgin stories and how you were in church and everything. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I grew up in the church, and they stressed and preached that sex is the worst thing possible,  and I bought into it until the night of my 19th birthday, freshman in college, got drunk,  and ended up fucking some girl from the stockroom where I used to work.  I wasted four good years of high school missing out on shit.  You weren't going to get laid at 15.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's getting laid at 15, 16? 
[02:06:30]  Not white kids.  Anthony did.  At 15?  In the suburbs?  Sure.  15?  He was...  He already had...  Yeah, no, he started at 13.  No way.  I'd love to tell you about it, but my mind can't work right now.  I swear to you, I am going to have to get up and go to the bathroom.  Just eat something real quick.  This is a first.  They'll push it right at you and eat something.  Anthony doesn't like talking about this stuff.  I am just...  He doesn't talk about bowel movement, so it's got to be bad.  It is all-encompassing right now in my mind. 
[02:07:00]  With that said, let's go to Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve?  Hello?  Hello?  This is the only phone call I want to take today.  Dr. Steve?  Your phone stinks.  Your phone's a...  The answer to the...  Your phone stinks.  Call me after the show, he said.  Check your email.  Check your email, sir.  Check your email. 
[02:07:30]  Check your email.  All right, we want to play the technical virgin stuff as we go to break, actually, Anthony.  I wanted to really get into this virgin talk.  Maybe we can talk about it after the break.  When we get back.  Because...  We'll be refreshed.  A friend's sister, 23, still a virgin.  23.  They're missing out on some fine, fine nights.  Well, I don't understand your Catholic religion.  They say no sex, but yet there's so many kids in Catholic families.  The second they get out of sex, they just make up for everything, right?  Oh, my God, you can't even stand up straight. 
[02:08:00]  And you're holding the back of your pants.  You're not walking like that on purpose, are you?  No.  You are limping a little bit.  I just really got to go.  All right.  Anthony's going to go take a dump.  We'll play a couple of these technical virgin spots.  Here's the first one.  Listen to this.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal sex. 
[02:08:30]  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two.  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex, the smart choice for your future.  Isn't that great?  We've got another one, too.  Listen to this.  I know my mom worries about me.  She's afraid I'll do too much too soon and with the wrong boy.  That's why she got me this.  At first, I was a little nervous.  But when mom showed me how to use it, I knew boys could wait. 
[02:09:00]  Now I can have my fun, and mom doesn't have to worry.  Vibrators, the smart choice for your future.  There you go.  Technical verdict.  Isn't that hot?  All right.  We'll take a break so Anthony can do his, well, he is doing his business.  He's a private person, though.  If it was Jimmy, Jimmy would do it live on the show for us.  Take pictures of it. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, this is very rare for Anthony to actually have to dump.  Yeah.  All right.  This came in from Tom, Tom M.  I'm going to be taking a meeting in the very near future, Mr. Voss,  with a person that is an arch enemy of this program.  And everyone is trying to speculate and figure out who I'm meeting with in the near future.  What do you mean?  This person will help XM, and he also wants to, you know, take a peek at our radio show.  And he's an enemy. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, arch enemy.  From the old days.  Arch enemy.  And everyone's trying to figure out who this person is.  I know who it is.  It's been an ongoing thing.  There's a speculation thread on a whack bag that is ridiculous at this point.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Pages and pages and pages.  And no one's guessed it?  That's a good question.  No comment.  How's that?  I'd like to keep the speculation going for a little while longer.  And people are now sending in stuff because they're trying to figure out who this person is. 
[02:10:30]  So they're taking my audio and stuff and splicing it together and throwing it out there so other people can try to figure it out.  All right?  So here's the latest from Tom.  Tom's very obsessed with this because this is the second one he's done, right?  Mm-hmm.  Here's Tom.  And this is how I'm justifying taking a high-powered meeting in the very near future with someone that will definitely, definitely help the company.  I will give him that much credit.  We realize that we probably need to bring on some people that we could look toward. 
[02:11:00]  He will help the company a lot.  And then he wants to kind of take a peek at us.  That's a huge hint, by the way.  A huge hint.  Well, I told the Elo we would not answer this if they answered this person whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  You would never, ever fill some kind of boss world.  No fucking way.  No way.  Life sends through the hourglass. 
[02:11:30]  So is the ONA virus.  Uh, Villachez.  I got some info on here.  Oh, you do.  And, uh, I'm not...  Elvie.  Elvie.  I'm not, uh, misreading this, by the way.  This is how it's, uh, down on paper.  Internet movie database.  Villachez became alcoholic.  He did.  And depressed.  Is that a proper way to say that?  Became alcoholic?  Became alcoholic.  Really?  I guess so.  I would have said became an alcoholic.  Neither is correct.  Oh, no kidding.  Okay. 
[02:12:00]  There you go.  Or something new today.  Villachez became alcoholic and depressed,  so he missed several roles that he was offered.  His health problems also increased,  mostly suffering from ulcers and a spastic colon.  Oh, my God.  Oh, little shitting midget.  That is just awful.  I grabbed my pants again.  I was going to go for a role,  but I shit myself.  Just couldn't stop drinking half and half.  It went right through him. 
[02:12:30]  These weren't diapers.  Pampers.  Oh, God.  Little simulac duties.  He doesn't even have to buy, like, depends.  He could just use pampers.  Like, baby diapers.  Oh, my God.  They have little cartoon characters on them.  I shit myself.  Where's my fucking gun?  He got tired of looking at his little feet  sticking straight out off the toilet.  Gotta use the potty training stool  to take a leak.  Oh.  Dad's a little toilet paper  in his asshole  because it's raw. 
[02:13:00]  Nine dumps.  Can't stop eating spicy food.  What?  My asshole is killing me.  Oh, that's horrid.  Poor little fidget.  Oh, yes.  Fantasiatic.  Ow.  The pain.  The pain.  Ow.  Oh, my asshole.  Depends.  Depends. 
[02:13:30]  This is perfect.  This fantasy is to be in a bathroom  and have one solid lung come out.  Welcome.  Smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Get up there and ring the bell,  you little French speck.  Ah, Tattoo, you have shit yourself again. 
[02:14:00]  I can't help it, bud.  He's got to wear that white suit.  I finally beat you.  Walks away with a big brown stain in the back.  Waddles away.  It was so embarrassing.  I have to shake a nugget out of my pant leg.  He didn't even wipe his own little crack properly.  Big bang.  It wouldn't reach. 
[02:14:30]  Mr. Rock, could you wipe my ass again?  Back to the village,  says Anthony.  He became alcoholic and depressed,  so he missed several roles that he was offered.  His health problems also increased,  mostly suffering from ulcers  and a spastic hole.  But he nearly died of pneumonia in 1992.  It was little parrot lungs.  Oh, they were full of a thimble full of liquid.  I almost died.  It's little lungs.  On the afternoon of Saturday, 
[02:15:00]  September 4th, 1993.  93, yeah.  After having watched a movie.  What was the movie he watched?  Oh.  He wrote a novel.  Like Gulliver's Travels.  Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory.  This is depressing.  If you ever slept with an audition,  it would have made him.  There's a chocolate factory in my bathroom. 
[02:15:30]  Plastic colon in the chocolate factory.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Well, on the afternoon of Saturday,  September 4th, 1993,  after having watched a movie,  he wrote a note and made a tape recording  before shooting himself in his backyard.  Tape recording?  Oh, I'd love to hear that.  That would be nice.  Is there any way to get...  That has to be out there somewhere.  You've got to think.  Someone must have it.  You've got to think.  Wow. 
[02:16:00]  Couldn't take it anymore.  He was married once, wasn't he?  He was married at the time.  His common-law wife, Kathy Self,  Kathy Self, was that her name,  discovered his body and called the ambulance,  which took him to the medical center  of North Hollywood,  where he died at 340.  Villachez was cremated,  and his ashes were scattered off  Point Furman in Los Angeles.  They were scattered over a daisy.  The ashes were flicked in an aftime.  How did his wife discover the body 
[02:16:30]  while the cat was trying to bury it in the yard?  Under some sand.  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  That car chase ending rocked.  That was a good ending.  During the commercials, we went to Fox News  and had a great car chase in California.  Here's the replay.  Here's the replay going down right now.  A bunch of trucks making a big traffic jam for the car. 
[02:17:00]  How?  He got around one,  and he was trying to squeeze through two more trucks,  and at the last minute,  the truck to his right decided to cut him off,  and he just slammed into it.  Slammed into both trucks.  Ruined the front of his car.  He wasn't going anywhere after that.  Forward, reverse, nowhere.  And then it looks like the truck was leaking  some fine fuel there, some diesel.  Yeah, he hit like right where the tanks are on the truck,  so it started leaking,  and they pulled the guy out of there,  threw him on the ground. 
[02:17:30]  Over.  That was great.  That was a good ending.  Lately, we haven't seen good endings.  No, I hate when they stop,  and there's a standoff,  but then the guy just gives up.  Yeah.  Anticlimactic.  All right, you guys want to talk about  Tyra Banks and her fat suit?  Yes.  It's all the rage.  It's all the rage all over TV.  They were promoing this for quite a while.  Tyra, I guess,  wanting to see what it's like to be a fat broad,  so she put herself in a fat suit.  She's part of the XM Nation.  I wonder how the rest of XM is handling the Tyra stunt. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, that's right.  She is part of XM.  She's part of Take 5, isn't she?  Take 5.  The women's channel, right?  Hmm.  That is funny.  Take 5.  Knuckles.  They call it Take 5.  Yeah, I'll give you a 5.  That's why she wound up having sex.  Come on, baby.  Take 5.  Take 5.  And, yeah, she put herself in a fat suit  and walked around  and tried to see the, you know, 
[02:18:30]  the inhumanity  that fat people have to endure during the day.  I couldn't watch this thing,  but I did see one clip  where she got off a bus or something  and immediately three people started laughing.  Oh, really?  And I was thinking to myself,  people don't do that to fat people in general.  They don't.  Just ignore it.  They don't openly laugh  as soon as you get off a bus.  So now I'm thinking that the makeup job  had to be so awful  The fat suit looked so bad.  that they're like,  oh my God, that's hilarious.  Especially probably still have it.  We see fat people  as soon as we can leave the building today.  We'll see them.  And I don't see people openly laughing at fat people. 
[02:19:00]  I just don't see it.  Unless it's really bizarre.  Like that woman,  Jimmy took a picture of her ass at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  Remember he was like,  we were at the baggage carousel  and some fat woman walked past  and Jimmy goes,  I gotta get a picture of her ass.  And he followed her.  He's just walking  because she had triple ass.  You've seen double ass.  Yeah.  Big fat ass.  And then in the middle somewhere,  there's like a separate little,  like, um,  like, uh,  Quato  on, uh,  what movie was that? 
[02:19:30]  Total Recall?  Total Recall.  Like, Quato,  another ass was coming out of her ass.  And then in that ass  was yet a third ass.  You never see the ass hat trick  on the fat broad.  But there it was.  Three asses.  Yeah.  This fat trick at the airport,  like,  I was moving my luggage,  you know,  we own it  and she couldn't get around  and we're bumping.  And she says to me,  she goes,  that's a big suitcase.  I go,  well,  you're a big lady.  You said that?  Yeah.  Well,  you're a big lady.  And then I'm going up the escalator 
[02:20:00]  and you see where the husband  pointing at me.  What were you going up?  I was going up the escalator.  Oh.  Why?  What do you think I said?  I thought you said escalator.  Did you say escalator?  You probably did.  Jot it down  because I know I heard it.  I can't even keep track anymore.  There's so many.  The escalator.  He wanted to say  installation earlier  and he said installation.  Installation of the escalator.  He wanted to say oatmeal earlier  and he said oatmeal.  And he wanted to say,  he wanted to say gonorrhea  but he said gonorrhea.  Gondorrhea. 
[02:20:30]  I'll tell you what.  And now you're saying  he said what?  I'll tell you one day.  Excalator.  I'll tell you one day.  Excalator.  Maybe my vocabulary  isn't the greatest  but I'll come in here one day  and take one of those  IQ tests off the internet  and I'll probably score.  Those are completely  legit IQ tests.  Why aren't they legitimate?  They're on the internet.  They're IQ tests.  Have you taken one?  Maybe someday.  We still have an hour and a half.  Go get the test.  What's your IQ?  What's your excuse?  I'm tired.  To take an IQ test?  You know, you've got to be  kind of like... 
[02:21:00]  You're just bragging then.  You can do well on  one of these internet IQ tests  so let's do it.  What was your IQ on  when you did?  What, you're tired all of a sudden  you don't remember  like who the first president was?  That's...  Yeah.  It's more a logic problem.  Yeah, it's logic.  You've got to figure them out  and stuff.  If this box was folded up,  you know,  what would it look like?  If this flat piece  was folded on the lines,  what would it look like  when it's done?  If you're a 15-year-old girl  isn't going to fuck you.  Yeah, logic problem.  Logic problem.  She's 15. 
[02:21:30]  DeeDee.  Good morning.  How are you?  DeeDee.  We love DeeDee.  She works in Washington, D.C.  and she's trying to do a talk show.  DeeDee, we'll get to you  but you could maybe help us  through the segment a little bit.  We're talking about Tyra Banks  and her fat suit.  Okay.  I didn't see the show  but okay, tell me.  Um, well, first of all  we're thinking that  people don't laugh  at fat people.  No.  She's trying to claim  that she got off a bus  or something  and immediately three people  started laughing at her  and I don't see people  laughing at fat people  as I go about my business. 
[02:22:00]  Now, DeeDee.  Yes?  You're cute as a button  but you're a chubby girl.  Let's be honest.  She's not that bad.  Just, I said chubby.  Big boned.  Why are you calling her fat?  Me?  I'm saying I'm skinny.  Like, I wish I had  a little more meat on me.  There are people  that are made  in different shapes and sizes  and apparently  I'm not saying anything bad  because DeeDee does great  for herself.  FedEx guys,  counterfeiters.  No, no, no.  UPS guys.  I love FedEx. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, UPS guys.  She hates FedEx.  FedEx guys.  She loves UPS.  But do you find people  like treating you badly?  No.  I think it's all about  you know what?  God made us all different.  You've got to be happy  with what he gave you.  Isn't that fantastic?  That's wonderful.  I want to applaud that.  That's wonderful.  She's still a great lay though.  What?  She probably tries harder.  Yeah.  You definitely try harder  with the BJs and stuff?  Uh-uh.  You know what?  I'm not going to talk about that.  Well, we hear the girls  try harder 
[02:23:00]  if they have a few extra pounds.  I don't know.  I don't buy that God  makes us all different.  I mean,  because when you come out  of the womb,  you're not 400 pounds,  you know.  You know what?  I'm not saying DeeDee.  I don't even know her.  I'm saying people in general.  You are born with a body type  and then it's up to you  to decide  I'm going to be  on the lower side  of this body type  or the higher side  of this body type.  But then you see  some of these fat people  and I look at them  and I go,  there's no way  I could ever get that fat.  If I start eating today, 
[02:23:30]  you know,  five, six meals,  I couldn't do it.  You think laying on a couch  for like three years  just eating fat food,  you couldn't be the guy  that needs to be taken out  with a forklift?  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  I think you're born with that.  Well, your metabolism.  Your metabolism is good.  I think you're born with,  I'll call it a body type.  I think, you know,  you could still control it  to a certain extent  but there are people out there,  I just look at them like,  it's impossible.  I could never be that size.  Well, I mean,  we eat all day.  You eat all,  I mean,  you eat a lot  but you're active.  I'm not eating  the fried foods  and the desserts and stuff 
[02:24:00]  but how much  you got to eat.  It's that steel cut oatmeal.  Wonderful stuff.  Oh boy,  hold on,  I've got to add another one  to the list here  because the phones  just went nuts.  Dan in Illinois.  Yes, Dan.  All right,  I'm just pointing out  that Rich just said  big boned.  Yeah,  it's coming in  on instant feedback.  No,  whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  that's a saying,  that's a black  from the black name of it.  That's a saying,  which is big boned.  Big boned.  That was the joke. 
[02:24:30]  All right,  boned.  I'll give Rich that one.  Have any black listeners  call it.  I've never heard it.  I've never heard anybody.  I've never heard big boned.  Please,  you call,  ask any of your black listeners  to call in  and they'll verify  big boned.  No,  they ain't going to back you up  on this one.  I'm sorry.  All right,  we'll see.  I've heard cheddar  and all the other ones  and paper and all that.  I've never heard big boned dead.  Okay,  watch.  Here's what they're saying  about those IQ tests online.  They're a scam.  They make them real easy  so when they give you a score, 
[02:25:00]  it's high  and you can then in quotes  buy the full IQ report  and print it out.  See,  that's what it's all about  so then you could brag  that you have a high IQ.  There you go.  All right,  D.D.  Good morning.  So we're going to go over  some audio from the  Tyra Banks fat suit  It's special.  It was a very big deal.  Everyone's talking about it.  I hear she does a great job  for XM on Take 5.  Hey,  there you go.  There's the plug.  So I don't want anyone  mad at me 
[02:25:30]  down there in Washington  for talking about Tyra.  Elo's saying  ovaries alive and well  on Take 5.  So here we go.  Let's get right into the audio.  Have you ever stared  at an overweight person  or sized somebody up  just because they were different?  Most of us  have been guilty  of judging somebody  because they didn't  dress like you,  act like you.  Most?  Mostly because  they didn't look like you.  I've judged.  I've judged. 
[02:26:00]  I've judged.  I get thousands  of heartbreaking emails  and letters  every day  from overweight women  who are the target  of the last accepted form  of discrimination.  They actually dread  going out in public  because of the laugh,  the stares,  and the humiliation.  What's wrong  with the fuel?  You may have been  a victim of this.  And if you haven't,  I want you to imagine  what it must be like  to be that person.  Today,  I'm not just imagining it.  I decided to be  that woman  and to go undercover 
[02:26:30]  by becoming  350 pounds.  To experience  firsthand  how we as a society  treat people  who do not necessarily  fit in.  And what I learned  has changed  my life.  I mean that.  It has completely  changed my life.  And I'm going to share  my experiences  with you.  Very dramatic.  Thank you.  Very dramatic opening.  What kind of award 
[02:27:00]  is she going to get  for this, you think?  Daytime Emmy?  I don't know.  What is she going to get?  She's full of shit.  Peabody Award?  What do they give out?  The Peabody Award.  I don't think so.  Pulitzer Prize?  Do you really openly  laugh at someone  that's really fat?  No.  I don't.  I'll look.  Not openly.  I'll poke them  with a stick  but I'm not going  to laugh at them.  Let's see.  I'm trying to be  completely honest.  Yeah, let's take it.  Openly,  I wouldn't laugh  at them.  No.  If you're with  a group of friends  and they walk by  and it's ridiculous  and they're maybe 
[02:27:30]  wearing clothing  that isn't appropriate  for that body type,  then yeah,  you're going to laugh.  But you're not going to  let me get to make it.  You're going to say something  why the fuck  is she wearing  that halter top  when she should be  wearing like a tent  or something?  Yeah, I've seen  fat like Puerto Rican  broads around  New York City  that have like  bellies hanging out  and they're not even  considered like  ridiculous 350 pound  fat suit fat.  They're just,  you know,  overweight a little bit  and they're wearing  these little  halter tops  and short shorts, 
[02:28:00]  Daisy Dukes  and yeah,  I'll laugh at that.  The juicy sweats.  Juicy.  Look,  every white fat chick  is some black guy  that'll bang her.  Oh yeah.  They just love  fat white chicks.  It's the blonde  at the laundromat  with the big fat ass.  Some skinny black guy  with three teeth.  Yeah.  It's always a skinny black guy  who's got a bunch of keys  hanging from him.  You know,  like he has a four hour job  and he thinks he's important.  He's banging her  and he's got some like  half black kid  running around 
[02:28:30]  the laundromat.  You know.  Here we go.  Dee Dee,  comments so far?  No,  I want to hear more.  All right,  here we go.  Here's the first fat guest  on Tyra Banks'  fat suit special.  Kathina doesn't even know  how much she weighs  because her scale  only goes up  to 350 pounds.  And she says  she constantly  beats herself up  from looking  the way she does.  That's terrific.  My name is Kathina.  I believe  that I weigh  somewhere between  400 and 400 
[02:29:00]  within 25 pounds.  Nobody weighs  150 pounds  has an idea  what it's like  to live in my body.  You get left behind.  People act like  you're invisible,  like you don't exist.  Sometimes I spend  my whole weekend  just sitting  and thinking,  why me?  Why do I have to be  the one like this?  Why do I have to be  fat?  And why do I have  to go through this?  It's not easy for me.  I don't want to be  like this.  Tyra,  I am  I'm at my way  in. 
[02:29:30]  I have  fought with this  for a long time.  I'm willing to put in  all the work necessary  because  I'm tired of this.  I can't  deal with this anymore.  Four and a quarter  is her cut off point  where she can't  take it anymore?  Yeah.  Four and a quarter.  That's where she goes,  alright,  I'm ready now.  I'm drawing a line.  I was  I'm two pounds overweight  and I got upset  the other night.  At two pounds,  I'm going,  holy shit,  I got to get back  down to 168. 
[02:30:00]  It doesn't  Why are you  taking more seriously?  I put a scale  last night.  That's what I mean  by body type.  This lady,  alright,  so she's overeating  and stuff,  but her body type,  it could easily  be 100 pounds less.  Easily.  Maybe she was abused  when she was a kid.  They say that.  Well, yeah.  Who hasn't been abused  when they were a kid?  Uh-oh.  No, I'm saying maybe,  like, no,  Oprah said.  Ah, that bullshit.  Oprah.  Did you just say  Oprah said?  Yeah.  Oprah,  when was she  fucking Masters  and Johnson?  Well, I'm just saying 
[02:30:30]  she's mentioned  that maybe she was  sexually abused  when she was a child  because that happens a lot.  You,  I don't know.  I want one person  to call up right now  and say they had  a perfect child  to grow up.  Shut up with that  abuse as a kid crap.  How about the,  look at the Snapple lady.  Her abuse amounted  to nothing more  than a little sister  being born  and her parents  maybe not giving her  as much attention  as she got  when she was  an only child.  This is what she  blamed.  That's what she  blamed it on.  She cried.  Being a fat adult. 
[02:31:00]  About that  and that's what she  blames her eating on.  Do we have that clip still?  Is that she didn't  get the attention  because,  you know,  everyone could have  an excuse.  Enough with the excuses.  Unless your uncle  is ass fucking you  while shoving  a Subway sandwich  down your throat,  maybe that would  tie into the  overweight thing.  No,  because you're  getting rewarded.  You're getting  a Subway sandwich.  It's an addiction.  That's what it is.  Here's the thing too.  You know what?  Okay,  you gotta take  responsibility  for your own lives. 
[02:31:30]  Instead of coming up  with the reason  why this happened.  Some vague,  shallow reason.  Yeah,  stop.  I'm just trying  to figure out  why she got that big.  I'm not saying  I'm right.  This is my view  on the whole  stupid thing.  Let's say hi to Rocket  who says I'm wrong  about something.  Oh,  Rocket?  Hey,  guys.  Hey.  Hey,  I had a friend  that he weighed  probably close to  400 pounds  and I knew him  for about six months  and a buddy of mine  told me,  he said, 
[02:32:00]  you know,  he used to look  like you  and I said,  get the fuck  out of here  and sure as shit,  I saw a picture  of him  and he was  about 160 pounds,  six foot tall  and he put on  a shitload of weight  and maybe he had  the thyroid.  Maybe there was  a medical problem,  you know,  I'm generalizing  obviously,  but there are  cases where  all of a sudden  you have some kind  of medical problem  and you gain  a lot of weight  because of that.  That's what happened  to me,  Hashimoto's disease,  thyroid condition.  What?  Yes,  I have Hashimoto's.  They just put me  on my second dose.  Hashimoto's?  You've got some  Japanese disease? 
[02:32:30]  No,  it's a thyroid condition.  You have the bird flu.  You have the bird flu.  What's the bird flu?  What's Hashimoto's?  What's Hashimoto's?  It's called Hashimoto's.  It's a thyroid condition.  Hashimoto's?  Hashimoto's?  That is when your  thyroid,  the kamikaze's  into your voice box.  I'm serious.  That's where  some kamikaze  into your mouth.  Hashimoto's disease.  That's what it's called.  What?  Hey, Rich,  you're doing a good job  today,  by the way.  Happy Hanukkah.  All right.  Say Hanukkah already?  What?  Now,  Didi?  Yes. 
[02:33:00]  What's Hashimoto's?  Hashimoto's?  Hashimoto's.  Look it up.  It's a thyroid condition.  Google it.  You can Google it.  It's also a cell phone.  I got the news of Hashimoto's.  Seriously,  I see an endocrinologist.  The Hashimoto's.  You think you would  start eating with chopsticks  and you wouldn't get  so much weight.  You wouldn't get  so much fucking food.  Hello, Hashimoto.  I get to Hashimoto.  That's the name of it.  It's called Hashimoto's disease.  Hashimoto.  Hashimoto.  And I'm on a medicine  called Lavoxel.  Really?  It's a thyroid medicine.  Somalia.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  You know what?  I will bring in pictures.  When you see pictures  from me from three years ago  to now,  it's a disease.  How do you catch Hashimoto's?  You want to catch  the Bukkake disease?  I know what that is.  Hashimoto.  What now?  Aren't there medications  for thyroid conditions?  It's called Lavoxel.  Well,  I'm on Lavoxel.  So why aren't you down to...  Because it takes time.  You know,  they got the cure  for the Hashimoto.  Really?  What is that?  It's called the Saladmoto. 
[02:34:00]  It takes...  You know what?  I'm funny, right?  Your body goes through...  I'm trying to explain it,  damn it.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  All right.  Explain Hashimoto.  Eric found a little info  on the Hashimoto disease.  Hey.  What it is  and how it's treated.  Hashimoto's disease  is a problem  with your thyroid gland  located in your neck.  Yeah.  The thyroid gland  makes hormones  that control  how your body uses energy.  When you have  Hashimoto's disease,  your immune system  begins to attack 
[02:34:30]  your thyroid gland,  causing it to become  swollen and irritated.  When this happens,  your thyroid can't make  hormones as it should.  But if it's swelling  up your throat area,  then how the hell  are you getting  the food down?  Shouldn't that stop you  from eating,  Dr. Ropi?  Shouldn't that cause  anorexia?  I know.  Dr. Ropi,  I'm interested in reading  your paper on Hashimoto disease.  I do.  I am.  If the...  If your neck is swollen,  how do you eat?  What are the symptoms  of Hashimoto's disease? 
[02:35:00]  These are some of the symptoms  someone with the disease  may have.  Because the thyroid gland  may swell when you  have Hashimoto's disease,  you may have a feeling  of fullness or tightness  in your throat.  You may have trouble  swallowing food or liquids.  Thank you!  I said it!  Ropi,  your throat is kind of hurting.  My throat is shit.  Hashimoto?  Hashimoto!  Hey!  Hashimoto!  You might notice  a swelling or bump  called a goiter  in the front of your neck.  I don't have that.  You didn't have the goiter?  No, no, no, no. 
[02:35:30]  Nothing sexier  than a good goiter.  Do you carry a camera  now?  No.  There's so many jokes  about what she does have  in the front of her neck.  You may experience  tiredness,  forgetfulness,  depression,  coarse dry skin,  slow heartbeat,  weight gain,  constipation.  Oh, dude,  you got the shits?  No, constipation,  it's all stuff.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  You get the cloggage.  And intolerance to cold.  Wow, I have all those symptoms. 
[02:36:00]  What the fuck?  Yeah, it wasn't.  I hate reading this.  Maybe I got the Hashimoto.  I got the tiredness  from time to time.  Forgetfulness, sure.  Depression,  not as bad.  Dry skin.  Every disease  has all those  same symptoms.  I know.  They're all the same symptoms.  Yeah.  Many people,  the disease,  have no symptoms at all.  An ordinary blood test  may just show  that the thyroid hormones  are out of balance.  All right.  So is your thyroid  all balanced now?  No, it's getting balanced.  They put me on my second dose.  See, they start you out 
[02:36:30]  on the lowest dose  and it builds up.  It takes time.  You know what counteracts that?  Cocaine.  No, no, no.  Come on,  you know how I am.  When I get coked  and electrified up,  I end up married and vagabond.  Oh, man,  we've wanted to get you  off the wagon so bad.  How much did you weigh  before Hashimoto?  You know what?  I'll send you pictures.  All right,  please do.  Yeah, send me pictures.  Is she a bigums?  No, she's just chunky.  She's a little chubby.  I like the DD.  Of course.  All right,  why don't we go back  to the Tyra Banks  fat suit special? 
[02:37:00]  People have said  negative things to you.  Tell me what somebody said  about you being  a waste of oxygen.  Yeah.  It actually wasn't said to me,  but it was said  to a close friend of mine  that fat people  are a waste of oxygen,  that we need not exist.  There is no use for us  in this world.  And as far as I'm concerned,  a person who says  something like that  is just as bad  as the person  who's a racist.  Because it's a form  of bigot.  They're both like that.  It's not worse.  Exactly.  It's not worse.  I'm going to talk  about my experience 
[02:37:30]  because I think that  the way people  do treat people  that aren't the skinniest  people in the world  is worse.  And I've been a black woman  my whole life,  so I've experienced racism.  Yeah.  But...  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  Oh, boy.  I would say  out of every black person  on the face  of this earth,  Tyra Banks  is on the bottom  of the list  for people  who have experienced racism.  Right.  I would say  she is...  There's no one 
[02:38:00]  below her.  She was probably  an adorable kid,  adolescent,  probably just  stunningly cute,  and then she grew up  to be a beautiful woman.  There's no racism there.  What white guy  wouldn't want to  bed her down?  And you're always like,  you know,  you'd always be trying,  and she's not like  black, black.  No Angela Davis  afro on her head  and big, you know,  black, black skis.  She's not coming out.  Oh, Lord, 
[02:38:30]  a little big Aunt Jemima thing.  It's nothing like that.  She's a white chick  with a great tan.  Did you just say  bed her down?  What are you,  little fucking lady  from Misery?  Bed her down.  What?  Bed her down?  Bed her down.  Just banger,  you're saying.  Bed her down?  Bed her down.  Well, listen,  Mr. Man.  No one says  bed her down.  To bed her down.  Bed her down.  Not better.  You're saying  better down.  No, bed her down.  All right,  well,  write that down  for me,  Hope,  and we'll keep score,  and at the end  of the show, 
[02:39:00]  if they've made  numbers that go up  high enough  to count Rich's score.  All right,  well,  there's racism  involved with the fact that...  You know,  I'm sure when she was  a-courting,  when guys were  a-courting her,  if I may use a term  from the 1800s.  Sitting on the porch  and drinking lemonade.  Right.  Maybe a mint julep.  Tyra's beyond beautiful,  and I don't think she's...  Look at that picture.  There's no racist.  You could...  There's a guy  in a Klan outfit 
[02:39:30]  tipping his pointy  little fucking mask  to her.  She would walk down  the street,  he'd go,  Howdy, ma'am!  There is no racist.  Look at her.  If anything,  you might want to  just kill her  because she's so hot.  You know,  not because she's black.  Look how fine.  Look how beautiful that is.  Anyone who gave her shit,  it's because she's too hot,  not because she's black.  Yeah.  It all comes...  She's tan.  They're just intimidated.  Even the KKK  could understand  that she's a hot piece of ass.  Are you kidding me?  Of course. 
[02:40:00]  Seriously.  Your beliefs go away  when you're horny,  by the way.  Yeah.  That's so funny  you brought up  Angela Davis.  Do you think  any of these people  listening know  Angela Davis?  Only through past references.  Stoky Carmichael  or Eldridge Cleaver.  Hoagy Carmichael?  Stoky.  No,  Stoky Carmichael.  Eldridge Cleaver,  Huey Newton.  All right,  we're going to go back  to the Tyra Banks  Fat Suit Special.  Here's the second  fat guest on the show  and I guess  they have a plane story. 
[02:40:30]  That's when I do  get annoyed.  Say it now.  That's the only time  I get annoyed  when it's,  you know,  here's the problem  with aircraft.  Aircraft are made  to be very light  because they have to fly.  So they're not built  for big fat people.  Every little inch  of an aircraft  is allotted  and the seats are made  for your average person.  They could be  a little overweight,  underweight,  whatever.  But when you're talking  hefty, hefty people,  the plane just ain't  fucking built for it.  It's not built 
[02:41:00]  for you to sit there  and have someone else  sitting next to you.  Sorry.  It's just the way it is.  Take it up with God.  Right.  He came up with these  laws of gravity and stuff.  Gravity lift.  Lift.  Well, I'm just saying  the gravity could be  because they're fat.  It's not going to help.  Right.  Got to be a little lighter  to fly.  So it kind of makes sense,  right, Ant?  Certainly does.  All right.  This guy makes a great point  that we've missed out  on already.  Rob in Chicago.  Rob.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Rob.  I just wanted to know 
[02:41:30]  if either you guys  found it a little ironic  that Tyra Banks  feels so sorry  for how these fat women  are treated,  yet every penny  that she has  and everything  that she's earned  in her life  is due to the fact  that she's perpetuated  this perfect body myth.  Yeah.  I mean, she'd be nothing  if she were overweight.  She has no idea  what it's like.  Right.  You know,  now she's all boo-hoo.  Rob, you are brilliant.  She only knows  what it's like  to be a beautiful person  that is just, like, 
[02:42:00]  accepted everywhere she goes,  talked to  as a beautiful person  is talked to.  She's exploited  in the female form.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, but...  And she could put herself  in a fat suit  for a week,  a month,  a year.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter  because until  she's really fat  and walking around,  she just won't know.  If she wants to do  a really brave show,  she should...  Gain the weight.  Well, not...  Well, gain the weight  or, you know,  take up the subject 
[02:42:30]  how a lot of young girls  are emulating  Tyra Banks  and...  Tyra Banks,  excuse me.  We're all turning  into rich here today.  Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks  and other, you know,  models.  They're trying to get  as thin as possible  and stuff.  Yeah.  Because they see,  you know,  Tyra Banks  and the magazines  and stuff.  That would be a brave  show to take on  that subject.  Did you see those  two ladies?  The old ones  are like 40 or 50  and they're anorexic  and they're like  40 pounds each.  Did you see that? 
[02:43:00]  Ask Lindsay  next time you see her.  They're doing this  on...  What show is it?  I don't know.  Not entertainment.  They're all the same show.  The Insider?  I don't know.  I just saw them.  The one that  Kathy Lee Gifford's  now on.  Peek.  Oh, and they're  doing it  because we're  just gawking,  you know?  It's sick.  Where are they?  In London?  The skeletons.  The bags of bones.  Can we get that audio?  That's another thing  I missed out on.  I should have told you guys.  Rich is not kidding.  They're like 45 pounds,  Ant.  They're twins.  People... 
[02:43:30]  I openly laugh  when I see this on TV.  People in Auschwitz  are going,  look how unhealthy  they are.  They have coffee  and cigarettes  for lunch  and what do they  have for dinner?  I couldn't listen  or watch.  After I saw them  for like a minute,  I go...  They went into  their cupboard,  their kitchen  because they live together.  None of the appliances  are plugged in  because they have  no need for it.  Don't need them.  And then their cupboard  had like,  I think it was  a can of beans  or something.  One of the most  healthiest things  you could get  in a can  and she's like,  I don't eat that 
[02:44:00]  because it has  two grams of fat.  What do they eat?  I don't remember.  They have to eat something.  Even anorexics has it.  Like a salad or something?  Bacon soda.  What do they eat?  Oh, it's great though.  Water.  Air Parmesan.  Actually, it is...  It is...  I mean, that's just as bad  as this.  It is Stokey  and not Stokey.  Adam.  Hey, Midget Digit,  it's Stokey Carmichael,  not Stokey Carmichael.  I said Stokey.  That's what I said.  Stokey, Stokey.  Well, we'll have to  wait for the replay.  All right,  here's the rest  of that racist comment. 
[02:44:30]  Fat and racism.  Yeah.  So I've experienced racism,  but the discrimination  that I felt  when I went out  and put on the weight  was a totally different thing  and was way worse  than being a black woman.  Way worse.  No, no.  It's way worse  than being a beautiful,  model,  black woman.  Beautiful,  model,  black woman.  Yeah, why don't you  try to change things,  gain 25,  30 pounds  and still walk the runways. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got a lot of power now.  Why don't you try to change  how we look at people  that are a little overweight  there, Kyra.  When I got on the flight,  the captain and the stewardess  were looking at me  head to toe,  which made me  very uncomfortable.  Happens when she's  not in the fat suit.  They just told her  to watch me  throughout the flight,  my flight attendant.  to watch you  throughout the flight?  Why would they say  to watch you?  If I were to lift  my armrest  or take my seatbelt off  at any time  during the flight,  I was to be charged 
[02:45:30]  at the next airport.  For another seat?  For another seat.  If you were to lift  your armrest?  Yes.  I just want to say  that my children...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's a lot.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I got a problem already.  I got a problem already.  Come on!  Charger with another seat  as she spills  into the other seat.  First of all,  how does she get  through security?  Someone out there trying  to do honest TV?  You've got to question that.  That's just hilarious. 
[02:46:00]  Dude, airport security?  Right.  Doesn't see her  in a fake fucking suit?  No, no,  this is another guest  on our show  talking about how  she was on a plane.  Oh, real fat people?  Yeah.  I thought she took  a little test  and took a flight.  No, we're not at that point yet.  This is just like...  Hey, Jesus Christ,  help me out here.  How funny is that?  I've got to start.  Yeah, let me hear it again then.  Yeah, listen to this.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I'll listen.  It says,  second fat guest on the show  talking about an experience  she had on a plane.  When I got on the flight,  the captain and the stewardess 
[02:46:30]  were looking me head to toe  which made me very uncomfortable  and then they just told her  to watch me throughout the flight,  my flight attendant.  So watch you throughout the flight?  Yes.  Why would they say to watch you?  If I were to lift my armrest  or take my seatbelt off  at any time during the flight,  I was to be charged  at the next airport.  What?  For another seat?  For another seat.  If you were to lift your armrest?  Yes.  I just want to say  that my children  were sitting next to me.  They're sitting next to me. 
[02:47:00]  It's okay.  It's okay.  Fucking hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin.  I want you to take me back  to the airplane  because you were angry  and by every means  you were angry  and you sued them  and you won.  Yes, I did.  You won.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  My children  were sitting next to me.  Whoa.  Three little weebles  sitting in their fucking seats. 
[02:47:30]  Mommy, I'm upset.  Can I have some of the snacks  you packed for the ride?  First things first,  write down hemoglobin.  You don't have to pay  if you lift up  your fucking arm thing.  If you're fat, you do  because then you spill  into the other seat.  But if there's nobody  next to you,  that seat is...  You can lay down.  So you're saying  that everybody  lays down in the plane  and you've got to fucking pay  just because  fatty's rolls  if the seat's not there. 
[02:48:00]  Are you sitting there  with a clipboard  just waiting for you  to lift up the arm?  Look, I don't know  if she's saying  her children were sitting  next to her on one side  or there's an empty seat  on the other side.  It's an empty seat.  Or somebody maybe  sitting next to her.  You know, whatever.  You don't want to be  subjected to that.  To somebody lifting up.  Imagine a fat person  like that sitting next  to you on the plane  and they lift up  the armrest.  And now you're inconvenienced  by being squished over.  Your headphone jack  is plugged into a belly button 
[02:48:30]  because you're trying  to fucking lift  their fat up.  You think that little armrest  is stopping the fat  from going on top  and under it  and touching you?  A little stress  on that thing?  There's still the fat  is coming at you  from every angle  so there's three inches  of fat not touching you  where the armrest is.  That's like trying  to hold mercury.  Yeah.  Just kind of keep it  in one place.  Dee Dee, any comments yet?  No, I don't get  the way she would be.  If she was sitting  next to her kids  she said, right?  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  Well, how could she be?  I would be the tattletale  telling the stewardess  and then the stewardess  would walk over  put the armrest back down.  Put it down  or we're charging.  And of course  the pilot looked  the rover  until she sat down  so he knows  which aileron  he's got to hold down  for the entire  fucking flight.  Plane goes into  a barrel roll.  What is a...  Aileron?  Aileron?  Yeah.  That's what  abanks the plane, Opie.  If Fatty is on  the right side  you're going to have  to give it  a little aileron.  Keep that right side 
[02:49:30]  up a little bit.  A little down  on the right side  aileron.  And how the hell  do you know that?  Uh, actually  Discovery Wings.  Forget Aristotle  and fuck Socrates.  Here comes  Professor Anthony.  Waiting for Bill  Barr to say, uh...  Well, Anthony,  you're smart.  Why did I learn  everything from  Discovery Channel?  Ruin that bit.  Hey, DeeDee?  Yeah, Anthony's  a smart guy.  Thank you, DeeDee.  And Opie is...  Smart too.  No.  I'm not as smart  as Anthony. 
[02:50:00]  Help me out.  Opie is...  I don't know.  I...  I don't know.  He's good at...  What?  He's good at...  You're good at a lot.  Oh.  I can't pinpoint it.  You can't quite  pinpoint it.  She can't quite  zero in on it.  Yeah, I can't quite  zero in on it.  Yeah, I can't quite  zero in on it.  Yeah, whatever it is.  That's the problem  with most listeners  of this show.  So thank you, DeeDee.  You're welcome.  I'm good at a lot.  Yeah.  I'm smart too, aren't I?  All right, here we go.  Here's another...  clip from the  Tyra Banks fat suit special. 
[02:50:30]  Here it is.  Tyra finally in her fat suit  stepping off the bus  for the first time.  I wanted to get out  on the street  in an area that I know  is very prejudiced  against people  that are 20 pounds overweight.  And I was like,  you know what?  I want to go out  200 pounds heavier  and see how people  react to me  because I'm the same  person underneath.  Same personality,  same everything.  You won't believe  the way that people  outright treated me.  The looks, the stairs,  was the last  in between things.  I was shocked.  Wow, she just blew it. 
[02:51:00]  She knows of areas  where they are  very, very critical.  Prejudice against fat people.  Yeah, obviously she  hangs out in areas a lot  and has no problem with it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's called  I never knew.  She knew.  I had no clue.  And then she kind of  bashes herself.  She said,  she goes out in a fat suit  and she's still  the same person,  still the same personality  and she's getting shit.  Well, maybe her beauty  is covering up the fact  that people think  you're a fucking asshole  but they don't treat her  like an asshole 
[02:51:30]  because she's skinny.  Now when she's fat  and doesn't have the beauty  to fall back on,  her true personality stinks.  That could be.  Ooh.  Maybe.  Here we go, another clip.  Because I know a lot of people  that are this weight.  I personally know them  and you never see them eat.  And it's like,  when do they eat?  And it's probably  because they're embarrassed  to be judged  that people are thinking,  why are they eating?  Not why are they eating that,  but why are they eating?  She knows all these people.  Yeah.  She personally knows  a lot of people this size? 
[02:52:00]  No.  No, she doesn't.  How many she hang out with?  You know,  they run in their hot pack  and they're hiding  and eating  when no one's looking.  If you're at dinner  or lunch  with someone  that's overweight  and they're ordering  a reasonable meal  in front of you,  you're not laughing.  You're like,  okay, look,  you're trying to do  something about it.  Right?  The fact is,  they don't want to eat  all the crap  in front of you. 
[02:52:30]  Well,  fat people do do that a lot.  They'll eat regular  in front of you  and then they'll run home  and, you know,  rape a buffet  or something  and binge, you know.  Not all,  not unless they have Hashimoto's.  Hashimoto's.  Hashimoto's.  And I do want to say,  you know,  since I found out,  I have a trainer,  Laurent.  He's sexy  and it keeps me going.  You have a personal trainer?  Yes, I do.  His name is Laurent.  What are they paying you  over there at XM?  I do voiceovers, too,  on the side, remember?  Oh, that's right. 
[02:53:00]  And what does he make you do?  I hate everything.  You know what?  I should have him,  I'll let you talk to him.  He'll tell you.  Do you do a lot of chin-ups?  I do a lot of stuff.  I do everything.  He works, yeah.  You do the girly push-ups  on your knees?  Oh, yeah.  Shut up.  I do real push-ups.  Does he work you so hard  that you have to go,  oh, it stings?  I have to shower.  I stink.  Oh,  I always take a shower  after I work out  because you're all sweaty  and ick.  All right.  I was mentally exhausted,  Tyra says in this clip. 
[02:53:30]  Let's listen in.  I'm used to people  noticing me  since I was like 18 years old,  so I tuned that out,  but I couldn't tune this out.  This was a whole different  type of stare.  This was like a rude stare,  and this was like  I wasn't a real person stare.  Oh, my God.  You're in a rubber suit.  How many people were staring?  After so many hours  of living this experiment,  it was taking a toll on me,  but I knew that  at the end of the day...  Oh, my God.  This is way too dramatic for me. 
[02:54:00]  So dramatic.  It was taking a toll on me.  How spoiled are you?  You can't wear a fat suit  for one afternoon?  Yeah.  Put anyone else in a fat suit  and then walk around  and go,  yeah,  people looked at me weird,  other people ignored me,  whatever.  That's what happened.  It's taking its toll.  See,  I'm so used to being beautiful  24 hours a day  and just gawked over  for my beauty  that this was really  fucking me up.  What she was seeing 
[02:54:30]  was a lot of looks  that we all get.  You don't have to be fat.  Right.  The look of an average  looking person.  There it is.  This is what we deal  with every day there, Tyra.  Yeah.  You're so hot  that people look at you  like they can't believe  what they're seeing.  Yeah.  They're not looking  because you're in a fat suit.  They're like,  ah,  another regular person.  Everyone's got their  cross to bear.  I mean,  shit.  Rich,  when you had that,  the hair,  the jerry curl,  people probably stared at that. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah,  because I was different.  I had my big afro.  Walk around with a big  Cyrano de Bergerac  zit on my nose.  You know,  you walk around,  people look.  And I once had a pimple.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Date?  What date?  I was a senior  in high school.  Wow.  Well,  would you put vinegar on it?  Yeah.  That was the home remedy.  You know why  they were staring at her?  Maybe because she had  this fat suit on  but her little skinny  pretty face. 
[02:55:30]  Nah,  they made her face  all chubby.  They did that too?  Yeah,  it looked like  they did an alright job.  Yeah,  they put...  How many hours  of living this experiment,  it was taking a toll on me.  But I knew that  at the end of the day,  I could take this suit off.  Others can't.  The makeup artist Todd  earlier in that day  told me that I looked beautiful  even with all of the  extra layers of flesh  on my face.  I honestly felt great  when he told me this.  I wish he could tell  millions of women  in America  the same thing.  I walked back to the bus 
[02:56:00]  to prepare for the last  part of the experiment.  And I was mentally exhausted.  Oh, God.  I was mentally exhausted.  No, you weren't.  The next clip, Nathaniel?  This is set up?  Yeah, this is just her  coming back from that  video segment you just heard.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and there is  a little dead air  at the start  and you'll hear why.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  I hope we can handle this.  This can be very dramatic. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, God.  I was so hurt, you guys.  I know it's probably  strange for you to comfort me,  but I was so hurt  when I walked down a street,  Robertson Boulevard,  here in Los Angeles  that I have walked down  a million times.  And the first,  I stepped off that bus  and I saw three people  turn around,  stare at me,  start pointing  and start laughing 
[02:57:00]  in my face.  And the thing  that hurt me even more,  and I can say this to you,  was that they were  black people.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I was like,  Of course.  We're black.  Sometimes your own people  treat you the worst.  The worst.  And I don't get that.  Goddamn,  look at that fat fish.  Goddamn,  look at that fat fish  on it.  Goddamn.  Wow.  Oh, she's...  The producer, cry.  You gotta cry.  Yeah.  You guys. 
[02:57:30]  They want all these  fat housewives  that are in the audience  to feel sorry for her.  Yeah.  She's now out of her fat suit.  Sorry.  That she had to wear  for what,  four hours maybe,  six hours?  And now she's looking  for sympathy  from the fat audience.  I had to cover  these perfect tits  for what seemed like hours,  but it was like minutes,  but I had to cover them.  This perfect ass  was covered  in a fat suit  and people laughed at me. 
[02:58:00]  I couldn't even see  my own vagina.  My own beautiful,  tight vagina.  Vagina.  Now had a bunt  covering it.  I didn't know what to do.  Doesn't it take away  from her emotional breakdown  there when she goes,  you guys,  you guys,  you guys,  you guys.  I know I'm really hot  right now,  but this was really  uncuffed.  We're off the air.  Get those fatties  out of here.  All right,  fatties out. 
[02:58:30]  Bring the cripples in.  Book me a table.  Yeah,  she's making reservations  at another one  of the exclusive restaurants  that the fatties  will never see.  They can't even get access  to the dumpster  out back  to eat the food.  She starts to cry.  Yeah.  And black people  may fuck.  And they were  black people.  Of course.  Black people  love making fun of people.  Black people  are the kings  of making fun of people. 
[02:59:00]  Stop.  You think it's whitey?  It's not.  You'd be surprised  if it was white people  because white people  are so guilt ridden  that they would look,  if it was a white fat woman,  they'd laugh their ass off,  but a black fat woman,  they're probably just like,  no,  I won't do it.  They probably won't  have to say,  can you watch my kids  or something on the show I do.  Black people are ruthless  to each other.  Of course.  Are you kidding me?  Look at that bitch  is a fat ass  motherfucking fat  fuck fat bitch. 
[02:59:30]  God damn,  that's a fat ass bitch.  Dee Dee, comment?  No,  just the emotional part.  Yeah,  very emotional.  Were you affected by that?  No.  Oh, good.  Good to hear.  Oh, boy.  So now you got tired.  What's wrong?  I have to do traffic soon.  For where?  I've been on with you guys  over a half hour.  Chicago?  Chicago,  Minnie and Pittsburgh.  Chicago.  Chicago, yeah.  Minnie and Pittsburgh, too.  Well,  there's a lot of cars  to get through today. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  On the Dan Ryan.  On the Dan Ryan.  That's good.  Yeah.  We're going to have to talk  about your show concept  tomorrow, I guess.  Okay.  I will do that.  Yes.  We love you,  and I hope you're all right  with that Hachimoko.  Hachimoto.  What is it, Dan?  Hachimoto.  Huh?  I'm doing the right thing.  I'm on medicine,  and I'm doing the right thing.  When did you go on the medicine?  About five, six months ago.  Oh, okay.  So it's relatively recent.  Right.  See, I had a fight  with one of my doctors, though, 
[03:00:30]  and I changed doctors  because I knew something was wrong.  Karate shop?  What?  Nothing.  Do you know  what we can get a Cadillac door?  And some of that penicillin?  Hachimoto.  Hachimoto, this color voxel.  All right.  Hachimoto.  Dee Dee,  you're an ongoing story,  so we'll check in with you tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  Have a groovy one.  You do a great job, okay?  You guys rock.  Say hi to everyone  down there in Washington.  I will.  I hear everyone's  getting fired, though.  No, they're not.  Are you kidding me?  We get the communiques. 
[03:01:00]  Who?  What?  Nobody's getting fired.  Oh, maybe I get  the fun communiques  and no one else gets them.  I get some great ones.  She got Hachimoto,  now she's a fatso.  It's a serious disease.  Can we get Roboto on for a second?  Yeah, well,  I think we can do  a little better than that.  Hachimoto.  You cry.  That's a serious illness  if you don't know you have it.  It's serious?  I've never heard of it.  Well, it's out there  and a lot of people have it. 
[03:01:30]  They do?  Yeah.  You are the first person  I've ever heard  with the Hachimoto disease.  The Hachimoto.  I'll let you speak  to my endocrinologist, too.  We've been doing radio  a long time.  You would think  we would have heard  of the Hashimoto.  Of the Miyagi.  It's very common  in women more so than in men.  Really?  Between the ages  of 35 and 50, by the way.  35 and 50,  so it's a little later in life.  Yeah.  The thyroid starts screwing up.  And then,  how did you know  you had a problem? 
[03:02:00]  Because I knew  because I knew  I was gaining weight  for some reason  and then I told my one doctor  and they're like,  oh, it's just stress.  I said, no, it's not  because I'm not overeating.  I'm not doing anything different.  Something's wrong with my body.  I knew.  So I went to a different doctor.  They did a blood test.  Sent me to an endocrinologist  because it showed up  on the blood test  that I had Hachimoto's  and the endocrinologist  started me on my bed.  And now I'm a lot better  than what I was  over a year ago.  And I have a great,  sexy trainer  that keeps me going.  You guys would like him, 
[03:02:30]  Laura, eat cool.  Eat it, eat it.  I've got to eat it.  So sorry.  Oh my God.  It's a serious disease.  Whatever.  Hashimoto.  But you know what?  At least I only know  I have it  and I'm doing something about it.  That's the same thing.  Yes, thank God.  That's wonderful.  You can't sit in your pitties.  No.  All right.  You don't see monsters, do you?  In my throat.  We might have to  write a song parody.  It's been a while. 
[03:03:00]  Oh God.  We might have to actually  write a song parody  for the Hashimoto disease.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, we could do it  to the other one.  My disease is Japanese.  My disease is Japanese.  I really think so.  It's Hashimoto.  I taught you guys  something new today.  Yes.  Yes, thank you.  How many calories  do you take in on a day?  I take an average  like 1,000 I guess.  No way.  1,200.  Yeah.  1,200.  The normal.  Yeah.  Yes.  You don't go home 
[03:03:30]  and open up some cookies?  No, I'm not a binge eater.  It's a disease.  The thyroid really does  fuck your body up  if it's not working right.  Yeah.  How many shots of sperm  do you take in a day?  Wow.  Okay, I've got to go do traffic.  All right.  There's the end.  Go do some traffic.  She used to be known  as the Cricket, right?  Or Cricket.  I want to talk about that.  All right.  We like the Cricket.  I like the Cricket too,  but now I am on your show  so I can't be the Cricket.  She can't be Cricket.  I understand that  because that was on XM Kids, right? 
[03:04:00]  Right.  And you're not noticing  that there's a lot of new faces  down there in Washington?  No.  Really?  Wow, really?  And why do we get  these communicators from Elo  and he says stuff like,  from this moment on  do not even acknowledge  this person exists?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Elo's like a samurai.  Yeah.  I haven't met the new people.  Maybe they're hiding.  Oh, really?  All right.  Hold on.  I'm making a trans action.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:04:30]  Well, you guys have a good one.  I've got to go do traffic.  Yo, man, what you need?  What you need, man?  I've got what you need.  Oh, dear.  I'm learning that  some of the people  that work here  have a lot of side jobs.  All right.  Thank you, D.D.  You have a good one.  All right.  Say bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Hashimoto.  Hashimoto.  That's how they say goodbye to her.  Hashimoto.  How do you pull out the Hashimoto done to Mr. Roboto?  That's...  Hashimoto.  That's quite good.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:05:00]  So, the video was Tyra, and then she comes back from the video crying to the studio audience  and looking for some sympathy, and, well, a second fat guest on the show has to now tell  Tyra how great she is.  Of course.  Thank you.  Does anyone have a copy of the show?  Now we're going to watch it.  Of course.  She's sitting there looking all hot, and there's a fat slob on the stage, and now the fat slob  has to help her out.  I hate to interrupt you, but the first thing I want to say to Tyra is I was very skeptical 
[03:05:30]  about coming on the show.  I didn't know what, why you would do a story like this.  I thought, she can take her suit off, you know?  Yeah.  Why would I want to go talk to a supermodel about my fat?  Get ready to turn on the clap sign.  About my fat.  I'm sorry.  But the fact that I came here and saw you and saw your true compassion and the fact  that you were hurt when you got put in a situation like this really hurt me, that you had to 
[03:06:00]  go through that day.  Ah, you don't.  And I just wish that everybody could understand and just back off a little because an overweight  person beats themselves up enough.  We don't need you to beat us up, too.  It's a daily thing.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[03:06:30]  Yes, Tyra.  We have to back off.  You know, no one's saying anything about...  Can't get near that ass.  When Tyra got off the bus, she did it right in front of the Apollo.  That's why they were trying to...  Get out of it!  All right, we got two more clips.  Now there's a third guest that's a bit on the heavy side.  And I guess she's talking about how guys think fat girls are easy.  Society in general expects women to fit inside this box, this package that's supposed to  be defined on what a woman's supposed to look like.  And when you don't fit inside that box, people treat you differently. 
[03:07:00]  They treat you fully because you're not what they expect a woman to be.  Of course you don't fit.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good point, too.  Jim in Ohio.  Jim.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey.  See, I gotta call Bravo Sierra on this, okay?  Because I think...  I mean, consider, when she was out by herself, she had to have at least a camera crew, a sound  guy, and a fucking producer going around with her.  So I'm thinking all the people are looking at it, all these people surrounding her, and 
[03:07:30]  thinking this has got to be some kind of stunt.  Was it hidden camera, though?  I didn't see it.  I don't know.  It seems to me like the only way it works is if it's hidden camera.  Yeah, well, that's the way it's supposed to work.  But, I mean, you know as well as I do, that if you see somebody walking around the street  with a camera crew surrounding them, you know that people are just thinking it's some kind  of stunt, like Jimmy Kimmel or something like that, or what's that, Jimmy Glick or something,  you know?  Right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome. 
[03:08:00]  Sir.  Society in general expects women to fit inside this box, this package that's supposed to  be defined on what a woman's supposed to look like.  And when you don't fit inside that box, people treat you differently, they treat you poorly  because you're not what they expect a woman to be.  I mean, especially in Southern California, a lot of men see a plus-size woman as being easy,  and the reason behind that is because they figure because we're bigger, we're going to have  lower self-esteem, and we're just going to be grateful for whatever attention a man might 
[03:08:30]  give us, and so we're just going to take whatever it might be, which is usually the  scraps.  So they think you're easy, like you're just going to give it up faster than a penny girl.  We should appreciate the fact that they're even taking the time to give us...  No matter what he looks like or whatever.  Right.  There's just a little something coming our way, so we should take it and be happy.  Who would be easier to bang, the fat broad or Tyra Banks?  That's all I'm saying.  Both of them are in a bar, you're given an equal situation, you're a good-looking guy.  You walk up to either of them, give your best shot, you're a player, you're good at what 
[03:09:00]  you do, your lines.  You go up to Tyra, and you go up to the fat broad.  Who do you think you're going to be banging and feeding later in the evening?  Who are you going to be thinking about while you're banging the other one?  Who are you going to be trying to sneak out of your apartment before sunrise?  Hmm.  I wonder.  It's known.  It's a fact.  Fat chicks are looser. 
[03:09:30]  They are looking for a little more of that attention.  The love that they're not getting from society.  Can we get some fat girls to call the show?  And their cock blocks.  Use a fake name and tell us.  Come on, fat whores.  Give us a call.  And use a fake name, fake city, and tell us if you're easy or not because you're fat.  Because you're fat.  Mm-hmm.  Nathaniel?  Yes, I just wanted to say before going to the next track, which is Tyra talking about  her dates.  She had dates?  Yeah, she went on dates with the fat suit. 
[03:10:00]  But the audio kind of stinks because it's like hidden camera mic stuff.  Hidden mic.  So they had to subtitle everything.  So she just kind of gives a brief rundown of each of the three dates right now.  So should we do this or what?  It's just, eh.  What were the guys like?  They were fairly normal.  One was sort of a Mediterranean type.  Yeah.  And he was actually the most rude.  He was like, she's saying, as you can imagine, it's fairly hard for me.  He's like, I don't need to imagine, actually.  I'm looking at it.  Yeah.  But, you know, she was like, what if you take me back to my parents, or to your parents? 
[03:10:30]  They'd ask, you know, and he's like, they'd ask me what's wrong with me.  Of course.  And that's anybody, that's 99% of anyone's family.  If you dragged home some 400, what, 350 pounds she was going as?  A 350 pound woman and brought her to say Thanksgiving dinner at a family event, anything, and said,  I'd like to introduce you to, you know, my new girlfriend. 
[03:11:00]  But everyone would be asking you, dude, what the fuck?  I tell the famous story, I went out on a day with the Jewish broad.  Jew broad in this day and age.  I met her in college, and she was a friend of someone that was on my floor.  Come on, Hendry.  At the dorm.  We kind of hit it off back in the summer of 69.  69.  I don't know.  It was the summer of love.  So then I, you know, I go back to Long Island for the summer, and I call up this Jew broad. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  And I go over to take her to, you know, a movie or something, maybe a couple drinks.  And I walk into the house, and I walk into the living room, and a stereotypical Jewish mom.  It was the middle of the day, beautiful day, sunny.  She's in a bathrobe, hair all up in curlers.  Did she ask you to button up your shirt to cover the cross at the door before you went in?  All right, where's my cross today?  And then she, I swear to God, I was drinking a martini and doing her nails. 
[03:12:00]  It was like, you've got to be kidding me.  I walk in and say hi, because she's like, yeah, I want you to meet my mom.  So I go in there, and she introduces me to her mom.  I swear to you, she looked at me, realized that I wasn't Jewish.  Now, how would she know?  Look at me.  From the SS tattoos.  Realized I wasn't Jewish.  Gave me the once over, the up and down, and turned and started doing her nails and watching TV.  Didn't even acknowledge that I was in the room. 
[03:12:30]  Didn't even nod.  And the daughter left the room with me, so uncomfortable, it wasn't even funny.  Her own mother made her very uncomfortable.  I never went out with a Jew broad.  But it goes back to what Ann's saying.  It's not about being fat or whatever.  It's your parents or whoever expect a certain person you're going to bring home, I guess.  And if it's not within those parameters, of course they're not going to be too polite.  Maybe they will to your face, but then behind the scenes they won't.  One of my girlfriend's mothers was so prejudiced against Italians. 
[03:13:00]  Like every Italian was in the mob, a criminal of some sort, and it was very uncomfortable.  And she was a fat, just slob.  It was scary because all the daughters were like hot.  They're all skinny and everything.  And the mother was just fat, so you kind of knew where things were going to end up in the future.  But I used to work at a bakery, and I'd bring her bread.  I'd bring her French bread, Italian bread, rolls, everything, and just kept feeding this fat woman so she would like me a little more than anybody else that was Italian. 
[03:13:30]  She started calling you Gilbert.  Yeah.  Sarah just hung up.  Sarah was 300 pounds, and she wanted to say on this program today that she would never go out with a fat guy.  Wow.  And she hung up.  I guess she could have waited.  See, the fat chicks can get screwed by the skinny guys.  There's the chubby chasers.  Fat chick goes to a bar. 
[03:14:00]  That bar clears out where, you know, there's no more game left.  She's the only fat zebra at the watering hole.  The lion's going to fucking rip her throat out.  It's just going to happen.  But if you're just some fat, slob guy sitting at a bar, there could be the most heinous chick sitting there.  Ain't going to happen.  You're sitting there with your XM ONA shirt and your fat guy at the bar.  At the bar, comb over.  I used to have a mattress I used to keep out in the garage. 
[03:14:30]  Sexy boss story coming out.  In case I got a fat girl.  I couldn't bring her in front of my roommates.  In the garage.  Yeah, we didn't part.  No, no.  We're going to the boss suite.  This is where I bring my special girls.  Patrice O'Neal, who will be in tomorrow and the rest of the week, he said that he had a mattress down in the basement of his apartment.  He is the fat person.  But he would bring the ugly broads and the fat girls down to the basement where they had like a cot or a mattress.  Yeah.  We had a basement in the garage.  Patrice has personality.  Personality goes a long way. 
[03:15:00]  He's a funny guy.  Yeah.  See, in his check, I was flabbergasted at the Halloween party.  You know, he was always talking about his girl and how, you know, he's like, yeah, she's nice.  You know, she's cute.  He brought her in.  It was like, holy shit.  Girl's beautiful.  Good looking gal.  Yeah, and then me and Patrice were talking relationship, like relationship issues and stories and just, you know, what he thinks is a good relationship and stuff like that backstage at the Halloween thing. 
[03:15:30]  And worlds apart, I am on Mercury.  He is on fucking Pluto somewhere.  And I had no, he just treats her in a way that he sees as good.  I don't know whether just for him or for the couple or everything, but he treats her and he thinks it's fine.  I let her go.  I can't make her think that I'm really into it too much, but I, yeah, I let her go out and do these things and, you know, you got it. 
[03:16:00]  Some of the shit he was bringing up, I was just stunned.  It's like, maybe that's a black thing too that I'm just not getting.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go to break with a Stephen Lynch song that ties this whole thing.  Oh, I love something that ties.  Yes, this is a fine little song from Stephen Lynch.  Good friend of the show.  Check this out.  I'm going to bring a friend of mine to the stage.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Tite.

[03:18:00]  You won't leave her alone  You'll roll your eyes  Make sarcastic comments  While you're sucking on that chicken bone  But that's okay  You think you won the battle  But I tend to disagree  See, I know you  And your Achilles heel  And he's standing next to me  My non-discriminating friend  So what's that in your account? 
[03:18:30]  Non-discriminating friend  I'll nail you anyhow  I know that he's no looker  And he's had a couple rounds  But with every shot of Jaeger  Hey, you lose a couple pounds  Now baby, baby, baby  Bring the evening to an end  Just you and me  And my pal  And your big fat friend 
[03:19:00]  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the ONA virus  I'll tell you  I've had like horrible potty training  I've had one with my daughter  My daughter  Well, my first daughter  My daughter's like 21 now  But when she was young  I guess how old are you  When you're potty training  You're almost two years old 
[03:19:30]  Depends on the chromosomes  Right  But my wife was really into the potty training  And read all the books  And you have to  After she pees or shit  We all had to applaud  And everybody was around  It's a big deal  She's just about potty training  And my wife says  I was going out one day  And she says  You take her  You take her with you  So I have this baby  In the car seat  And she's just a little girl  A little baby  And we're out someplace  And she says to me  Dad, I have to go potty  And you know  My heart 
[03:20:00]  I get heart palpitations  I'm thinking  I can't go in a public restroom  I can't sit her down  And where am I going to take her?  I can't go in the men's room  And I'm like  I don't want her to sit down  I mean I can't go in the ladies room  I don't want her to sit down  In the men's room  So I said  Honey, you know  Can you hold it?  Is there any way to hold it?  And she goes  It's a little kid  You know it's a baby  Hold it?  Yes, yes  She goes  I'll try daddy  Because she can see the horror in my eyes  She goes  I'll try that  So I put her in the car  And I put her in the car seat  And we're driving down  The Ventura Freeway  I live in Los Angeles 
[03:20:30]  We're driving down  The Ventura Freeway  And she goes  From the back seat  I hear daddy  I can't hold it  I go okay honey  We'll pull off here  We'll pull off here  And we'll go to the gas station  She goes  No I can't hold it  I go okay okay fine  So we pull over to the side  Of the freeway  The side of the Ventura Freeway  This public freeway  And I pull out  And there's like hedges  On the side of the freeway there  So I get her out  I unbuckle her from the car seat  And I put her in my arm  And I go over to the hedges  And I take one step  Over to the hedges  And I don't realize  It's a gully  It's a ravine  Oh my god  So I step  And I slip on my back 
[03:21:00]  I fall on my back  And I start hurtling  Down this mountain  Down this side  Of the Ventura Freeway  And I'm holding the baby  I'm coddling her  On my side  She's screaming  I'm yelling  The twigs are breaking  There's mud  That my pants rip  It cuts my ass  And I end up  At the bottom of this gully  In this horrible  Like infested  Kind of wet puddle  And I'm bleeding  And I'm in this gully  And I'm holding the baby  And she's crying  And I kind of stand up  And I hold her in front of me 
[03:21:30]  And she goes  I gotta go  I gotta pee  I go okay  Alright  And I look  My wife had put her  In some sort of  Like a jumpsuit  Kind of thing  So I unbuckle the thing  And I pull it down  Around her ankles  And I'm holding her up  By the armpits  In front of me  And I go  Okay honey  Go go  And she goes  I can't  I'm gonna pee on my pants  I'm gonna pee  Because her legs are down below  And this is the first daughter  I've never really  You know  I grew up with brothers  And everything  I said okay  Alright  Put your  Just put your feet  Up on my shoulders  Up on my neck  I'm holding her in front of me  Like face to face  Put your feet  Up on my neck  And then I figure  You know  Your legs are out toward me 
[03:22:00]  And then you'll pee down  Into this  I saw this  You'd be shot by  Right  So her feet  Are up on my neck  And I go  Okay go  Well I didn't know  That it seems like  With the vagina  That the  Whatever way your feet  Are aiming  Is what way  The fluid goes  So she goes  And then all of a sudden  It's  In my face  She's pissing  In my face  My fucking mouth  In my mouth  I'm screaming  Like a woman  My ass is bleeding  I'm standing in a puddle 
[03:22:30]  Of  This is for a guy  Who didn't want to go  Into a public bathroom  And I start to scream  And she's screaming  And it's all over her clothes  And she goes  I got it on my clothes  My fucking clothes  It's in my fucking mouth  So I'm trying to be a good dad  And I take off her  The bottom of her pants  And now she's naked  And my hands are covered  In the mud  And the blood  So now it's all over her  And I'm filled with piss  She's filled with piss  And I try to climb the hill  Now I'm climbing the hill  And it's mud  You know  And I get up  Like five steps  And then I slide 
[03:23:00]  Back down the hill  And she's crying  And I'm almost crying  And I can't breathe  And you know my heart  I think I'm going to have  A heart attack  Finally after  It seems like an eternity  I get up  On top  On the freeway  And I come through the hedges  Like 500 feet  From where my car is  And I'm standing there  And I'm bleeding  And I'm covered in mud  And she's crying  And there's piss  And there's blood  And a car slows down  And I got a naked little girl  Out of the hedges  And the car slows down  And pulls down his window  And goes  Are you  Are you Howie Mandel  What is this
