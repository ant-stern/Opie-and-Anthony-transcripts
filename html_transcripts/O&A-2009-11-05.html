<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a celebratory discussion of the New York Yankees' World Series victory, focusing on Hideki Matsui's performance and contrasting the commentary styles of John Sterling and Joe Buck.  The hosts criticized CBS Radio's online presence and Newsday's paywall, then engaged in heated banter with callers expressing diverse opinions on the Yankees, their fans, and announcers, utilizing highly offensive language.  This led to a debate about a Dallas Cowboys cheerleaderâ€™s blackface Halloween costume, sparking a discussion on the concept of "fair-weather" fans and the nature of sports fandom.

The show then transitioned to a proposed "Blackface Day," evolving into a humorous debate on the "blackest" and "whitest" athletes, featuring mentions of Mickey Rivers, Manute Bol, Larry Bird, and Bruce Smith, and a caller, Mr. Coffee, contributing with a comedic impersonation.  They revisited the fired Cowboys cheerleader, predicting Al Sharpton's involvement and expanding the discussion to unjustified firings in general.  This was followed by the playing of profane outtakes from Dan Ingram's commercials, referencing defunct stores like Bambergers and Gimbels, and a story about one host's mother's alleged termination from Bambergers.

The broadcast continued with Anthony recounting an embarrassing experience of taking his asthmatic girlfriend to a pediatric emergency room, sparking numerous caller jokes.  A video montage of 70s/80s dating profiles preceded a brief appearance by comedian Bill Burr, who commented on the Yankees' win.

Next, the hosts enthusiastically celebrated the Yankees' victory again, using strong language and speculating on George Steinbrenner's health.  They debated the Yankees' spending habits compared to other teams (Red Sox, Brewers, Pirates), criticized the New York Jets' drafting history (with a reference to a YouTube video), and discussed various NFL drafts and players like Dan Marino and Tom Brady.  This segued into Jim Norton's embarrassing Ozzy Osbourne introduction (with audio clips), a caller's claim about Don Shula spreading rumors about Dan Marino, and a discussion of football injuries and the toll of professional sports.  The hosts also discussed improv versus stand-up comedy.  Dane Cook then joined as a guest in the studio.  The segment concluded with anecdotes about overeating at McDonald's, Bobby Kelly's hair loss treatment side effects, documentaries (*Anvil! The Story of Anvil* and the Mike Tyson documentary), and embarrassing social interactions.

A later segment focused on Dane Cook's upcoming Madison Square Garden show, including anecdotes about Cook accidentally not recognizing a chef, recollections of terrible 90s stand-up comedians (one with a fuzzy pink sweater, one doing backflips, and one wheelchair-bound after an accident), and stories about various other comedians.  The conversation then shifted to Cook's show, potential surprise guests, and banter between the hosts and guests, involving a story about Burr and Kelly's backstage antics with a Fiji water bottle and flat iron.  A discussion about dogs followed, prompted by a story about Burr's dog jumping from a moving car, leading to talk about dog breeds and anxieties around certain breeds (German Shepherds, Dobermans, Pit Bulls), responsible dog ownership, and appropriate interactions with dogs.  The show promoted Cook's show, mentioned absent regular participants, and included a CougarLife.com sponsor segment.

The final segment featured a chaotic discussion between the hosts and Bill Burr (with Bobby Kelly also present), covering dog training techniques, anger, potential for violence, hypothetical scenarios involving harming others, the unreliability of justice, the thalidomide scandal, true crime stories (a body hidden in apartments and a freezer malfunction), Guns N' Roses' double albums (*Use Your Illusion I & II*), a detailed breakdown of other double albums (Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chili Peppers), a phone call between Lindsay Lohan and her father, and a Ric Flair video clip and past interview.  The conversation was marked by profanity, crude humor, interruptions, antagonistic exchanges, and frequent topic shifts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be in Anthony, are no strangers to scandal.  We'll be in Anthony on Satellite Radio, host Anthony Kamiya and Greg Kopey, he's an controversial team.  Good comment, profanity, and Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy gag.  We'll be in Anthony's show.  We'll be in Anthony's show.  He's been the last straw for the raunchy radio duo.  For the raunchy radio duo.  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  It's a history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  It's shocking.  I love it!  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  Silly, stupid, whatever you want to call it.  Listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Hey, good morning.  What happened last night?  I didn't watch.  Watch what?  What happened last night?  I haven't watched.  I haven't read a newspaper.  Didn't turn on my Twitter.  I'm not watching TV.  I don't know.  What happened?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  Yes, of course. 
[00:01:30]  I don't think it's a legal win.  Why?  What happened?  What did you think?  I really believe Matsui might be a robot.  And I want Major League Baseball to do some testing.  He hits like a robot.  He hits perfectly.  He doesn't smile.  He doesn't have any human emotion.  I was getting all down on Matsui for a little while there.  He was kind of in a bit of a slump.  What?  And boy, he perked up.  What?  He went eight for nine instead of nine for nine? 
[00:02:00]  The guy's an animal.  Yeah.  He single-handedly won the World Series for you.  Well.  Well, last night, anyway.  Last night, he was very key.  Very key.  I think also key is the fact that Pettit outpitched Pedro.  Hold on.  Everybody was doing three days rest.  If I had to hit three days rest one more fucking time.  Hey, Pettit, three days rest.  Three days rest.  Three days rest.  He even said three days rest, though.  I know.  Everybody was. 
[00:02:30]  Shut up.  No, even Pettit was saying.  That's what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  So you got to yell at him, too, because he was nervous about pitching on three days rest.  Everybody.  Here's the Matsui home run call.  Oh, is this John Sterling?  I was watching the TV coverage, but the radio coverage is a little different.  Pitch.  Swung on and hit him to the end of right.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Hideki Matsui has just hit a two-run home run. 
[00:03:00]  A tremendous shot deep to right.  A thriller by Godzilla.  You had it.  Oh, the Sayonara kid comes around third.  A two-run home run to give the Yankees a two-nothing lead in the second inning in a clinching game.  Jesus, that's exhausting to listen to.  What a great call, except for that nonsense he throws in.  How about a couple periods in there?  Oh, God.  One long fucking say.  What the hell else are you going to say?  Yeah, John, it was such a good call. 
[00:03:30]  I actually missed.  I was so annoyed because I can't.  CBS radio is just shitty.  I couldn't.  I wanted to listen to Sterling last night because the guys on Fox are just, they're not Yankee guys.  They're boars.  I know.  And I wanted to watch the game and listen.  So I couldn't get fucking CBS on my Bose alarm clock radio on AM.  I probably need a better radio.  I was so aggravated.  So I go online.  CBS radio has boring news.  You can't listen online.  Do they have to fuck you for every dollar?  Yes.  Do you get to pay for audio? 
[00:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  You can't get on the iPhone app even for this?  No.  I checked the iPhone.  I was out of my mind.  Yeah.  It was fun like two years ago.  You could go online and watch anything.  And now it's just becoming a nightmare.  Now they really are.  Online is becoming a nightmare.  Charging for everything.  Charging for everything.  Commercials before every clip you want to see.  I was trying to look for links about the local election results, you know, yesterday.  And I put in Google News.  I put some of the names I want to see.  And I click on the links.  And it goes to a news day, which is a very popular Long Island rag. 
[00:04:30]  It's a horrendous newspaper.  Yeah.  Well, it's the most boring newspaper in America.  Well, you know what?  I wouldn't know because you have to sign up now, subscribe, and pay in order to see news day online.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not free anymore.  Eh, bastards.  Because their paper is, they're pretty much, every newspaper is losing money.  So now they just want to put it online and have you deal with it that way. 
[00:05:00]  Yep-ers.  Well, congrats to Ann and his Yankees, blah, blah, blah, 7-3 win.  Rivera was very good this series, too.  Oh, yeah.  Rivera's great.  Rivera closing, just remarkable.  Let me say hi to Josh.  The cutter.  Josh in Iowa.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  What the hell?  Hey.  We're having a full stadium.  Josh, you guys start over because something happened with the phone call. 
[00:05:30]  It wasn't set up right.  For real.  And then he hangs up.  All right.  Whatever.  Whatever.  He probably doesn't even believe me.  He'll find out on the replay or something.  You want to hear the final out?  I don't know if he was making some very racist remarks as to what John Sterling could also  say, to rhyme things.  With who?  Which one?  Matt Sui.  Matt Sui.  A round trip from the...  Oh.  Got it.  You know? 
[00:06:00]  It's a derogatory term for a Japanese person.  Rhyming or trip.  That was used in, like, World War II.  Oh, for the Nippy.  A round trip from the Nippy.  Well, here's Joe Buck.  There's two ways to look at it.  Here's Joe Buck announcing that the Yankees have won the World Series.  Giant, far-headed Joe Buck.  Joe Buck.  Who calls a good game?  To the second baseman, Cano.  The Yankees are back on top.  World champions for the 27th time. 
[00:06:30]  That was good.  I mean, it's like, you know, he's not a Yankee guy, but that was a good call.  No, he isn't.  He could have pumped it up a little bit more than that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a little bit more than that.  I don't know.  I think when, like, Major League Baseball has the World Series, they have someone like  Joe Buck.  Like, Jimmy makes a good point.  Joe Buck doesn't give a shit if the Yankees win or lose the World Series, right?  No.  Although, I wonder if he is a Yankees fan, because he hangs out with them a lot. 
[00:07:00]  We've seen Joe Buck hanging with the Yankees.  Yeah.  Does a lot with the Yankees.  But what they should do is get someone solid like Joe Buck, and then get the local guy  for that team that does have excitement, and bring him to the broadcast, the Fox broadcast.  You see Joe Buck saying something, and then, goodness gracious!  Well, yeah.  You've got to match it up nice.  You're right.  So, that was Joe Buck announcing the World Series champions.  The victory.  And it sounded a little different on radio, of course. 
[00:07:30]  Now, Rivera is set.  And here's the payoff.  Swung on and grounded a second.  Cano Fields throws to burst.  In time.  Ball game over.  World Series over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win!  By the way, that shows he has absolutely no creativity.  No.  Because now he's calling it like it's...  Like it's any game during the season. 
[00:08:00]  It's a regular baseball win.  He just added in World Series, but, yeah, it's still...  You could go back, and that would sound exactly the same as when the Yankees beat the Kansas  City Royals, 17-3, in early May.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's all he's got?  That's it.  He could have done a long...  A real long one.  Or something.  Yeah.  We could have not done it.  World Series over.  Not said it at all.  Exactly.  The New York Yankees!  He didn't say more after that.  I'm surprised. 
[00:08:30]  I bet that clip was cut short.  He obviously said more.  Someone's saying Joe Buck couldn't hate the Yankees more.  Yeah, Joe Buck is a fan either.  What team does he like?  Joe Morgan is definitely not a Yankee fan.  He's part of the Big Red Machine.  Yeah.  So he doesn't like the fact that the Yankees get all these credit.  I'm just going with the fact we went to...  What was that fucking thing?  Some kind of charity event, and Joe Buck was the master of ceremonies.  Yeah, well...  And he was kissing the Yankees' asses, and...  Charity event.  That little video vignette where he got involved, and he looked like he was buddy-buddy with 
[00:09:00]  everybody.  So, I apologize.  I think it's all bullshit.  I like the fact that every Yankee they spoke to after, right after the game, on the  field, said nothing about the Phillies being a good team.  You know, hey, we played a tough team.  Nothing.  Who said that?  None of the players.  I don't think, to be honest with you, someone said, yeah, there was different predictions.  One of the Phillies said that...  Rollins, I think, said that they were going to beat the Yankees in five or something.  I think the Yankees were fucking really irritated, because that's unlike Jeter and all those 
[00:09:30]  guys.  They didn't say...  Yeah, they were talking about Matsui, you know, they were talking about A-Rod finally  getting a ring, things like that.  Not one of them on the field, being interviewed, said, you know, I got my hats off to the Philadelphia  Phillies.  It was a good series.  It was a...  Nothing.  Yeah, I think Rollins predicted...  Fuck you.  Fuck your mothers.  Yeah, I think that's...  You know what, though?  That's how it should be, for every team that wins a championship.  Enough with the...  They were a great opponent, and it was bub.  Who cares?  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  That's...  That fake sportsmanship.  It is phony sportsmanship.  I really believe it's fake sportsmanship when they have to shake hands and do this and  that.  They don't want to do any of it.  I enjoyed the...  And I said this.  I had been Twittering.  First, I was just annoying people with my Twitters during the game about how everybody  should, you know, get along.  These are two great cities.  It's just a game.  Let's remember this, people.  And everybody was, you know, kind of waiting for the venom, I guess, to come out. 
[00:10:30]  I go, hey, Spur...  It was...  No, wait, wait.  Oh, rem...  Is that...  No, you got to go back up a little bit.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I forgot what happened.  Where are all my good twits?  Like where I was being nice.  Oh, I said, let's be nice now, people.  Come on.  They're all winners.  You keep going on me. 
[00:11:00]  Jesus, guys.  Let's be nice now, people.  Come on.  They're all winners.  Just getting this far.  A game shouldn't come between two great cities.  And then I said, hey, sports fans, let's just hope everyone gets through this game healthy.  God bless.  And everybody was getting mad.  Why?  That's a good point.  Well, then it was like, hey, Philly fans, let's be...  Hey, fans, let's be nice to the Phillies.  They've had to deal with their cunt mouth whore... 
[00:11:30]  Their cunt mother whore their whole lives.  This ass fucking must hurt them.  That's when it kind of turned.  Yeah, it seems like the tweets have gotten less gentle.  Yes.  And then it ended with the grand finale, fucking Rivera, yes, Yankees win, fuck you, Philly,  eat your dad's cum.  Well, that's terrific, Anthony.  I don't think they enjoyed...  That's just terrific.  I don't think they enjoyed that one at all, to tell you the truth. 
[00:12:00]  Why such anger?  It's just a baseball game.  Why anger?  Hey, look at all the fucking bullshit I had to listen to from those God fucking Philly fans  that were giving me relentless shit the entire time.  So fuck them.  Fuck them in the ass.  That's what I say.  I'd had it with them.  Let's go to Chris in Nashville.  Chris.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Chris.  I think Joe Buck came up with his St. Louis... 
[00:12:30]  I know his dad was a long-time announcer for the Cardinals, and he came up with that organization.  And also, I like John Sterling's call.  I live down in Nashville, and you really don't get to hear it much, but every time I hear it,  I kind of like it.  You really like it, huh?  I really do.  I don't know what to say about that.  Oh, no.  It's just...  I don't like it at all.  What we don't like about it is that it just sounds forced.  He's just forcing a moment instead of just kind of going with it.  It makes me laugh a little bit.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:13:00]  Maybe I'm just a silly dude.  I like it.  All right.  Right on.  Well, enough people like it because he continues to be their broadcaster, so we're actually  in the wrong.  The majority of people like John Sterling and like his home run call.  No, they don't.  I like how he calls a game, but then all that fucking horse shit.  Fucking bullshit he throws in there.  If he got rid of all that, he would be a really good baseball announcer.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Oklahoma.  Aaron.  Good morning, boys. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, Aaron.  I want to tell you why John Sterling sucks, and Joe Buck is better.  You know, I watched the game last night.  I watched all the games, and when they would hit a home run or like you guys played at the  end of the clip where Joe Buck just announced the call, and they just let you hear the crowd.  He could let you hear the crowd.  You heard the roar of the crowd when they won it, and John Sterling is a beveling shit.  Oh, that's true.  I kind of like when they just get the call out, and then you're able to hear the crowd  celebrating. 
[00:14:00]  You guys are missing the obvious, though.  Joe Buck's got the pictures.  You're watching on TV.  Oh, okay.  So Joe Buck doesn't have to say a lot, and, you know, they're going from camera to camera  to camera to camera, which is saying a lot.  I mean, you've got to understand, John Sterling's got to kind of fill up the space there.  It's still kind of cool to that initial...  Oh, yeah, that part, sure.  You just want to kind of hear that and bask in it a bit.  Right.  What is that like in the theater room, Anthony?  Oh, fantastic. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  I'm a fluttering prick.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Matt in Buffalo.  Hey, congrats on your stupid sabers last night, motherfucker.  Now, what do you got for the radio show?  At some point, I thought that Anthony had been abducted, and I was trying to negotiate  a deal for him to be returned to his normal self, so he would start tweeting with a little  venom, as he put it.  Yes, they didn't like my nice tweets. 
[00:15:00]  My nice, let's all be kind to each other tweets.  I got the grape soda and the 24 carton, the cool.  Ah, good.  Good for you.  Wow.  Is everyone tired?  What is he talking about?  Did everyone stay up too late?  I hope Phil is enjoying their one-esty.  Yeah.  Instead of dynasty, it's like die quickly.  Get it?  Could add German, a little German to it, an einesty.  Yeah, but when was the last dynasty in baseball? 
[00:15:30]  Yankees.  Yankees, so that goes back, what?  Yankees.  Ten years ago?  Yeah.  Well, when was the last time they won it, the Yankees?  2000.  2000?  Yeah.  All right.  2001's a heartbreaker.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  The worst sports loss ever.  Well, not the...  Well...  Way worse than the Red Sox.  In the World Series.  No, that was much worse than the Red Sox.  Because it was 2001, and they had it, and Rivera threw the ball.  That was by far...  The Red Sox winning was almost like, they're such rivals that you finally lost to a rival 
[00:16:00]  like that that didn't bother me nearly as much as fucking 2001.  Well, one was just the friggin', you know, ALC.  I would rather lose to...  One's the World Fucking Series, so...  All right, I understand that point.  But it was the dirty fucking Diamondbacks, like, this fucking expansion team.  Yeah.  And fucking Randy Johnson, that free agent cunt.  The big units?  I despise that.  I despise that team.  Yeah.  Red Sox were just the Red Sox.  They probably should have beaten the Yankees many times before then.  That, uh... 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  That deconstruction of the Yankees when they just got fucking tooled.  They had it in the bag.  Everyone was just like, well, you know, no one comes back from this many games.  That hurt.  And since it was the Red Sox, it really made it that much worse.  I'll take four years in a row of that to fucking have that Diamondbacks fucking game one.  That was bad.  Yeah, because it was.  It was 2001, so you're thinking, hey, for New York City, let's win this one.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  And the dirty fucking Diamondbacks.  The filthy Diamondbacks.  Yeah, fucking Tony Womack.  Hope his feet were lost in a fucking auto accident right after that.  Cocksuckered his awful fucking...  His stupid small vermin name.  There's a Womack crawling and licking peanut butter off my balls.  Oh, Womack.  I despise Tony Womack and fucking gangly Cunty Johnson.  I think we would have read about him losing his feet in a car crash.  No, you wouldn't have, because no one's thought of him since that game.  No one.  He actually lost his feet on the way out of the stadium. 
[00:17:30]  It was some kind of a vending accident.  Hot dog juice spilled on his feet, and they rotted off.  Shoot off by a wild Womack.  So if he'd lost his feet in a car accident, it wouldn't make the radar.  It wouldn't even make the fucking local radio in Arizona.  Okay, let's go to Ted in Toledo.  Hi, Ted.  Hi, Ted.  Hello.  What's up, Ted?  Yeah, I wanted to comment.  The reason that you guys are so hated, that the Yankees are so hated in the sports world  is because of arrogant assholes like Hare Kumia there, that greasy Dago that thinks that his shit doesn't stink 
[00:18:00]  because he thinks the Yankees are the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Ew.  If he just had a modicum of...  Hold on, sir.  Hold on one second.  I just want to...  Waiter, cliche, please.  Go ahead, sir.  Back to you.  Sorry.  Sliced bread isn't really that good.  No one says...  Sir, no one thinks sliced bread is anything.  I prefer a fistful of balled up bread.  No one went, wow, sliced bread?  Yeah.  I like the soccer ball kick bread into my friend's mouth. 
[00:18:30]  Listen, I'm the caller.  I'm the one that pays your salary, so you just listen to me.  Oh, I love it.  Damn.  I don't like that one.  How about let's negotiate, since you're paying the salary.  Yeah, really?  Let's fucking up the ante a little bit.  Have a little bit more money.  Then you can talk.  I kind of like the guy.  I know.  That's a good one.  You don't like it?  One of the better ones.  You loonies there, Toledo?  Yeah, fuck.  Oh, that's Ohio.  Yeah?  Close enough.  Yeah, I'll forget it, fella.  Listen, but no, I mean, seriously, if you guys weren't such arrogant Aaron Dickwats, 
[00:19:00]  maybe the Yankees would be a better-liked team.  Who cares?  Dude, people don't like the Yankees because they win.  That's it.  You know what it is?  They're not liked because they have 26...  Oh, oh, I mean 27 championships.  Oh, sorry.  I got to get you saying that.  It's like when the new year happens and you keep writing 2009 on your checks and stuff.  Yes.  I'll keep saying, like, 26.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, yes. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, I keep...  Yes, you keep forgetting it's now 27.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  That's what Anthony just joked about.  You're actually happy that A-Rod has a World Series ring.  I was very happy for him.  You know what?  Come on.  Let me tell you something.  Thank God this year, instead of one of the years where he didn't do shit in postseason,  and perhaps if the Yankees had squeaked by and he didn't do anything, you know, that  would have been like, oh, fuck that.  He fucking got him into the World Series.  He played the game in postseason this year, and he deserved that ring this year. 
[00:20:00]  A-Rod, though.  It's A-Rod.  Who cares?  He deserved it.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to fucking bash him?  He was great this year in the postseason.  Postseason, he showed up finally.  Good for him.  Good for your team.  He deserved to get the fucking ring.  A-Rod just...  Ugh.  Travis doesn't like A-Rod either, do you, Travis?  No, he doesn't.  Travis hates the Yankees.  He's a Yankee hater.  A-Rod.  Yankee hater.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah.  Brought up that way.  I'm just going to get...  If you like another team, yeah, you're supposed to hate the Yankees. 
[00:20:30]  I'm getting little Riley Yankee jerseys and hats.  This is why I couldn't root for the fucking Yankees in the World Series.  Yeah.  Because I'm a Met fan.  I mean, I'm going to be hearing this all next year now.  Well, I could root for the Mets if the Yankees ain't in it.  I mean, it was easier to...  I'm rooting for the Mets if they're in it.  Why not?  Well, that's just stupid.  Have a little fun with your town.  I'd rather see the Mets over the Red Sox.  Nope.  I would take the Mets every day.  Every day over the Red Sox.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's low self-esteem to take a division rival. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I would never take a division rival over any team.  Nope.  It was easier to root for the Phillies.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't...  Which, by the way, thank you, Opie.  You're welcome.  The sports curse.  You're welcome.  Still there.  By the way, I only have one win in the last seven picks.  Wow.  An Islander win when the Islanders should have lost, actually.  Mm.  But they lost last night to that same team.  Whatever, but that's hockey shit.  What, the Sabrees?  Sabrees kicked their ass and shut out the Islanders last night, ending their winning streak. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, but this is why, Ted.  I'm with you.  Oh, Ted.  I didn't hear you, Gregory.  Because there's a million...  Oh, Ted.  There's a million Anthony's in this town that'll just fucking rub it in all next year to us  Mets fans.  I'm not saying anything.  I hope the Mets do a lot better than they did this year, for fuck's sake.  Whatever.  They were a mess.  It's all about hockey now.  Now I'm all in with the hockey thing.  Well, now I'll start watching a little football.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a little football now.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Ted.  Thank you, sir.  For concentrating on that.  Bye.  See you, fellas.  Let me go to Greg in D.C.  Greg!  Greg!  Come down here.  I have AIDS.  Good morning, bo-bo-bo-boy.  Hello, Greg.  Listen, I hate the Yankees, and I want to be a good sport and congratulate Anthony for  being a fan who stuck with him, who, even though he was angry at them for screwing up,  kept saying, yeah, but I'm going to keep supporting him.  That is a Yankee fan.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's not a fucking man of integrity because he got mad at millionaires who weren't hitting 
[00:22:30]  the ball properly to other men with gloves.  That's what I thought was he kept supporting his team no matter how pissed off they might  have made him.  That means he still has not one ounce more of integrity than any other person.  He doesn't have one ounce more of integrity than a guy who wore a Yankee hat and shit  in the subway because he was drinking himself into oblivion.  That was me.  Greg, you're crazy because at any second he's going to tell you to eat your dad's cum. 
[00:23:00]  That's the type of man Anthony is.  That's the integrity I have.  He's got some terrific integrity.  Over a lousy baseball game, he's telling all of Philly to eat their dad's cum.  Exactly.  And they listen to him, which is really upsetting.  Put it in that cheesesteak of yours.  Hey, I listen to him because I pay for him to tell me this, and I like the abuse.  Thank you, sir.  The first thing I was calling to say, though, is people don't hate the Yankees as much as  they hate the Yankee fags.  The people who aren't real fans who jump on the bandwagon, start screaming and yelling 
[00:23:30]  and acting like they love the Yankees and don't know shit about them.  Yeah, I know.  You better know those utility players before you start cheering Bob or you're late to the  Yankee party.  Oh, sir.  By the way, Joe Girardi has adult braces, and it really gave me the willies.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Did you see that at the end?  The adult braces.  Jesus, he had coffee tongue.  I was so annoyed.  Does he really have adult braces?  I'm with Greg, though, with the Fairweather Fanship. 
[00:24:00]  I'm not silly.  You walk all around Manhattan.  I'm like, I couldn't count that high how many Yankee hats I saw.  They just all of a sudden come out of the woodwork.  And the Yankee hats are fucking brand fucking new, too.  They never have brands.  Anthony's fucking hat looks like it's been puked on a few times.  Yeah, I've had a few ulcerous vomit on it during some bad games.  Hey, that's in New Jersey.  Where were you six years ago?  Doing other things.  That's where I was, not watching. 
[00:24:30]  I don't know.  Joe Girardi, you can tell these guys, couldn't even name the fucking lineup of the team, half  of them, and walk around the streets.  Doesn't Girardi's head look exactly like the skull that the Predator was holding when he scratched it with his fingernail?  I don't remember it.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Well, I know Charlie Emanuel.  Could he stop sucking back saliva?  Boy, was he unpleasant.  You know, just a great bunch of guys.  Where's his adult braces?  Look.  Oh, he's got adult braces.  Look at him.  What is that about?  That is cute. 
[00:25:00]  Fucking pissel teeth.  Greg, anything else?  No, that was it, boys.  Have a wonderful day.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Adios.  I was there when they were in the basement.  Well, you shouldn't have been.  Why?  Exactly.  You should have been doing funny shit.  Let them work the kinks out.  Then I'll jump on board.  Exactly.  Who cares?  It's not even that.  It's the people that walk around.  They're barely sports fans in general.  I'm not taking a ride in a broken car.  I'll wait until it's all nice and fixed and ready to go.  Exactly.  Where were you when Ford stock was $1.20? 
[00:25:30]  Buying other stock.  Tell us.  You'll see them.  You'll see them today.  Oh, yeah.  Walk up to someone with a Yankee hat and ask them the starting lineup of the game last night even.  They wouldn't be able to tell you a lot of these people.  That's all I'm saying.  They're not real sports fans.  Jason in Ohio.  Jason.  Roger, guys.  What's up?  A great day to be a Yankee fan.  I'm calling around myself on a new bus.  I'm a former New Yorker, but I'm sad to say I have an autographed picture of John Sterling in my office. 
[00:26:00]  When he wrote on it, he wrote Yankees win.  It has like seven A's, seven N's, seven K's, and a bunch of E's and a bunch of S's.  He wrote that?  Oh, oh, oh.  So he wrote it like he says it.  Yes, he wrote it like he says it.  So he's really, really into that.  Every time you guys talk about it, it kills me when I walk by my office and I look at the picture and I laugh my ass off because of it.  Right on, man.  All right.  Congratulations, Anthony.  Great day to be a Yankee fan. 
[00:26:30]  Ah, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  You guys make a great point, though, about the Fairweather fans.  I live out in Ohio now, and I live actually across the river from Swisher's hometown, and all these people are out wearing Yankee stuff.  And I'm like, you're Yankee fans?  And I thought you were wearing White Sox stuff last year was when he was a White Sox.  Thank you.  That's the beauty of that.  They always have a party every year.  They're happy every year.  They're smarter than the dumbbells who are fucking slaves to one team where the players don't care about you.  The players don't give a fuck about you. 
[00:27:00]  They go from team to team.  Exactly.  And I could never root for, honestly, I'm back with the Yankees.  I came back this year.  I could never go to another team.  You didn't come back this year.  You came back two weeks ago.  But it doesn't matter.  Holy shit.  But I did.  You were motherfuckering them up until the end of the year.  But I don't have to explain myself.  I had a fucking legitimate reason to not like those motherfuckers.  I was a fan my whole life.  I got, please.  I don't have to justify myself that day.  I fucking, I jumped back on the bandwagon.  Yes, I did.  If Gino had been nice to me, I never would have left.  That's it. 
[00:27:30]  I had a personal reason to leave.  I actually, I actually am a real fan.  I fucking walked away.  A guy douched me.  And I'm like, fuck this.  I'm not watching these assholes.  If Reggie Jackson didn't take that picture with you two days ago, you would have fucking  been motherfuckering me.  Never.  Never would have.  Not Reggie.  Not Reggie, man.  Because Reggie is Reggie.  Fuck Reggie.  You can't say fuck Reggie.  He's Reggie.  Fuck Reggie if he didn't take the picture with you.  That's what I say.  What else is he going to do?  And especially if he's in our building.  But he did.  Working for our company.  He's just Reggie Jackson. 
[00:28:00]  So he's a guy I would have, I would have not been mad at regardless.  He should be nice and fucking take every picture possible.  He's bored with it.  He's been doing it for 40 years.  Bored with it.  He's sick of it.  So?  It's an easy life.  Imagine your whole life was you had to take pictures with fucking people that adored you.  Boo hoo.  Take the fucking picture.  Booty hooty hoo.  He did.  Take the fucking picture.  He did take it.  But I still wouldn't have fault him if he did.  He did the right thing.  But there's a lot of guys out there.  I'm happy I came back and the dirty Phillies fucking lost.  Good.  Good.  Dirty.  The dirty Phillies. 
[00:28:30]  Dirty Phillies.  No one likes a fucking PH at the beginning of a team name.  Put an F there.  Pahelies.  Pahelies.  All right, Jason.  Hey, how's that serial killer?  How many bodies are we up to?  I heard 11.  I don't know.  I'm about two hours south of the country.  I think it was 11, too.  Yeah, we're 11.  All right.  The funniest part of that story is the sausage factory next door.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking about that there was a sausage factory.  But the audio on the news, the neighborhood, it happened.  It's almost like Boo got shot or the leprechaun audio. 
[00:29:00]  People are like, oh, I think that was a guy.  I thought it was a dead body.  Yeah, yeah.  It smelled like it.  But let me tell you, I thought it was the sausage factory.  Well, can we get that audio?  I want to hear that audio now.  I want to hear some people discussing that.  And I'm hearing the parole officer fucked up.  Yeah.  It was actually on Fox News that had that audio.  The actual national Fox News that had it.  Oh, really?  The boys down the hall, please get that for us.  We're going to be talking about the serial killer in the, is it Cleveland?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Cleveland. 
[00:29:30]  I'm a neighbor in New York.  I've only been out in Ohio for a couple of years.  It's in the Cleveland area, though, right?  Yeah, it's actually in Cleveland.  I'm about two hours south of Cleveland.  Well, you're fucking closer than us, my brother.  I know, but I'd rather be back in New York right now, bud.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  You know, one of my favorite things is to do when the Yankees do what they do, win championships.  Watching the opposing team, the Phillies, the ones that have to sit in the dugout and just 
[00:30:00]  kind of sit on the bench and stare out, that thousand-yard stare, thinking of what might  have been.  Oh, it's like everyone.  Some people, right into the fucking locker room.  They're gone.  They're gone.  And then there's some that are just staring out like, ah, it should have been us celebrating.  And I just go, ah, ha, ha.  Some guys actually cry.  They sit there on the bench and just cry.  No one was crying last night, right?  No one was crying last night.  I think they, I think, I don't know.  I don't think athletes cry anymore.  What? 
[00:30:30]  No?  Nah, they're so goddamn rich.  Are they really that bummed they lost the World Series?  By Monday, I don't think they're that bummed anymore.  The next couple of days, next couple of days, that sucks.  Yeah, they're going to be bumming.  And then they get some caviar and they'll be fine.  Caviar.  Charlie in Virginia.  Charlie.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, ma'am.  Jimmy, I loved your show at the State Theater last winter.  Oh.  Thank you, sir, very much.  Down in D.C.  Anyway, the Washington Post had to take a shot at A-Rod last night. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, this morning.  I just had a chance to skim it quickly.  But they were taking issue with the fact that he blew a snot rocket on national TV.  And they pondered that, doesn't he know that there's a swine flu epidemic?  Oh, fucking that stupid newspaper.  Are they the same paper that the reporter asked Obama about A-Rod testing positive for steroids?  I believe that was the Washington Post.  I don't recall.  No, I don't.  Dumb fucking paper.  Let it go.  He's not giving the swine flu to anybody.  All these guys do is chew and spit. 
[00:31:30]  Who cares?  Enough with the swine flu, by the way.  Enough with the blank has the swine flu.  Oh, celebrity swine flu account.  Yes.  Enough with that crap.  You know what?  When it's all said and done, a lot of us are going to have the swine flu.  We're going to know a lot of people personally that got the swine flu.  Uh-huh.  And that got through it, by the way, too.  You know, unfortunately, we're going to lose some people, but we lose people with the regular flu.  We've had this discussion.  They say a lot of people aren't even getting the regular flu this year, that it's all swine flu. 
[00:32:00]  What's going to be up?  Yeah.  It's going to be up.  H1N1.  Yeah, H1N1.  I like to call it.  The hiney flu.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  Everyone's heated up.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  What's up, John?  The worst fucking bandwether fan you're ever going to see, and you all know one.  The whole chick that works up with a guy who's never followed sports. 
[00:32:30]  In their entire life, and all of a sudden, it's,  Woo-hoo, Yankees!  I love the Yankees!  Every piece of gear, the earrings, the shoelaces.  The pink hat.  Yeah, the pink hat was not a good call.  Yeah.  Well, it was all merchandising.  Well, they sell a lot of pink fucking hats.  You're right.  Yeah, Yankees sell a lot of merch.  How about the broads that the only reason they follow a team is because they want to bang the players.  They don't even know the rules of the game.  Good luck. 
[00:33:00]  Well, but they, in their stupid heads, they think they have a shot.  Yeah.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  And Kate Hudson and Kurt Russell, they're Yankee fans?  Really?  I guess so.  Kurt Russell was there last night, big-time Yankee fan.  He's got, I think he had a Yankee jacket on.  The only reason he's a Yankee, let's break this down.  Yeah.  The only reason Kurt Russell is a Yankee fan is because his little daughter sucks A-Rod's 
[00:33:30]  dog.  His little girl is fucking getting slammed by A-Rod.  Is it safe to say?  Did you ever see Kurt Russell at a Yankee game before Kate Hudson started dating A-Rod?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Do you break shit down like that?  Because there's Kurt Russell sitting next to Kate Hudson.  I'm like, that's the only reason here.  Yeah, I don't think so.  It's for a dirty reason.  Dirty.  In the dirtiest of ways.  Sex.  It's from sex.  It's from dirty sex.  Like the dirty sex.  Ah, yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie's been calling, I believe, almost every day during the World Series.  Ah, Charlie.  Ah, not every day, but...  Off and on.  Off and on.  All right.  What do you got?  So, what's up, boys?  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, did you sit back and smile with relief last night after Pedro Marpetine?  He threw, what, four or five pitches.  They zoom in on...  He's breathing heavy like he just got done throwing 60 pitches.  I knew right then and then.  I'm like, Phillies are done.  I knew pretty early on. 
[00:34:30]  Well, I was hoping, anyway, pretty early on, Pettit looked a lot better than Pedro did.  And, you know, by the way, I don't know if anyone knows this.  Pettit, three days rest.  I didn't hear that.  He was only on three days rest.  Yeah, I didn't either until, like, last night, out of nowhere, someone said it.  I was like, God, three days rest?  He was running out of gas, too.  Pettit was getting tired.  Oh, he was.  He was.  He was fucking walking people.  He never walks people.  No, but he was able to go a lot further than Pedro was, which...  Dude, if you're a fan of any team and you have a fucking elimination game and Pedro is 
[00:35:00]  on the mound for you against the Yankees, he cannot beat the Yankees.  He really can't close the deal.  Did you hear that stadium, too, just rocking the Who's Your Daddy?  When he first came out?  It was just the entire stadium.  Pedro.  Who's your daddy?  Pedro's now 38, man.  Yeah.  He didn't look like he was in shape.  No, he just...  But fucking Ryan Howard, man, let the Phillies down.  Holy shit.  I think he was 173, his batting average in the World Series. 
[00:35:30]  173 for Ryan Howard.  Damn, really?  Right, Charlie?  Is it Charlie or Charlie?  Charlie.  In Philly, they have Charlie, Anthony.  Yeah.  Charlie.  You'd be...  No, that's the real name.  There's Charlies and there's Charlies.  Really?  Only in Philly, though.  They got Charlies.  That's silly.  All right, Charlie.  Thank you, sir.  Later, boys.  See ya.  Let me go to Chad in Dallas.  Hey, Chad, your stupid cheerleaders are in trouble.  Eh, she's a cunt.  She's a cunt?  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  We'll take it to that story after your phone call.  What do you got, Chad?  Well, I've been listening to Ant talk about the fucking Yankees for the past two weeks.  And the fact that he's actually pissed off that it's taken nine years for them to get  a World Series, it blows my fucking mind.  Do you realize how many other fucking teams out there?  Yeah.  Decades and decades and decades.  Yeah.  You can take your fucking nine years and you can shove them up your fucking ass.  Nice.  I never said I was...  Nice.  I like it. 
[00:36:30]  I never said I expected it.  How long has it been for the Yankees?  I was mad.  I was...  You know what it is?  It has been for the Yankees.  It seemed like a bit of a dry spell nine years.  And they had been in the playoffs.  They had gotten close, but couldn't close the deal.  And it was good to see.  And very early on, this was the team that you looked at and said, wow, you know, this  is the team that can do it.  Really?  Can do.  Yes.  Well, the Mets have gone 51 years without a World Series. 
[00:37:00]  51 years.  Yeah.  And my fucking Rangers...  No way.  We've only won one fucking playoff game in our whole fucking history.  What team is this?  So fuck you in your nine years.  What team is this?  What team was it?  The Texas Rangers.  Oh, God.  We won one fucking playoff game.  Well, that's the thing, again, that abysmal organization, which has done nothing but suck...  Hold on.  The abysmal organization is paying half of their own salary.  They should fucking...  Here's the bottom line.  They should be hated to him because he's a fucking cunt.  The reason...  This will not shut up. 
[00:37:30]  The reason the teams keep doing dumb shit is because fans like you keep going, stupid.  True.  If I owned a team, I would just do whatever I wanted knowing that dumb fans are going to  show up.  Yeah.  Bandwagon fans make the fucking teams produce.  That's true.  Do you understand?  These abysmal organizations that know you dumb motherfuckers are going to show up regardless,  why would they give a shit?  Yeah, you'll be there.  Who cares?  Do whatever it is that's just going to make the extra money.  I'm not saying you, buddy. 
[00:38:00]  I'm saying in general.  I'm just saying in general.  Because I want to get my brand new world championship Yankee sweatshirt this year.  Yes.  Oh, and of course, I cannot wait to see world champion Philadelphia Phillies shirts on all  the little starving African children.  Is it going to go Africa this year again?  Maybe they go to another country with all that merch.  I'd say Africa.  I think it'd be great if they're, as they're shipping it over to Africa, the ship gets  taken over by pirates and you just see these stick figure Somali pirates wearing Philadelphia 
[00:38:30]  Phillies World Series champion shirts.  Vincent Bayonne, it was a joke, you stupid fuck.  I know it was 86, you dummy.  The Mets weren't even...  Did he actually say that when you said 50 years that he was like, no, idiot.  The Mets weren't even around in 48.  They weren't?  Jesus Christ.  The Metropolitans.  Hey, speaking of Dallas, so you got a cheerleader down there in trouble for wearing blackface. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, stop.  Did you hear about this story?  What's wrong with that?  Is it Halloween?  Yeah, a little Halloween party.  It's the problem.  What's the problem?  If you're, if you're, if you're going to go to, well, look, you, Halloween, you can dress  as anybody.  What if you want to dress as someone who's black and you're not black?  You have to then put the color on your skin.  It's not a minstrel show you're doing.  Well, let's find out what you did. 
[00:39:30]  You're putting on a costume and portraying a person with black skin.  So you must make your skin black.  There's nothing wrong with that.  What is that?  It's her like as a rapper or some shit.  Let's find out.  Here's the story.  They are the sweethearts of America's team.  The pride showpiece of the Dallas Cowboys.  Yet it's the reported actions of one of its cheerleaders off the field that is drawing  scrutiny and criticism tonight. 
[00:40:00]  It's all in fun.  What may appear to some as harmless Halloween fun.  It's making a big statement right there.  Is perhaps questionable behavior in the eyes of others.  It's the controversial costume donned by sophomore cheerleader identified as Whitney Isley.  Here she is posing with friends at a Halloween party dressed reportedly as rap artist Lil Wayne.  All right.  No story here.  Who gives no fucking shit?  No fucking story here.  She's dressed like Lil Wayne.  No fucking story here.  What is she supposed to be?  White skinned Lil Wayne? 
[00:40:30]  Lil Wayne has black skin.  If you want to dress like him, you need to put something on your white skin to make it black.  Would you stop with your oversensitive bull fucking shit?  Where's the media reporting on fucking white chicks?  The Wayne's Brothers movie.  Yeah.  Where is that?  There you go.  And they did it in Soul Man, the guy dressed in blackface.  What's the problem?  Stop already.  Why are we yelling?  So oversensitive.  Because we're annoyed.  So stupid fucking media.  So fucking oversensitive.  This isn't a fucking story.  Yeah, baby, baby.  Lil Wayne is a real celebrity and she dressed up as him at a Halloween party. 
[00:41:00]  End of fucking story.  Robert Downey Jr.  There you go.  Yeah.  No, it's okay if it's in a movie.  Because you're portraying what?  Right, it's different.  Why, you know.  Well, it's different in their stupid eyes.  Tropic Thunder.  I mean, why the fuck?  It's not like they're doing the, even Ted Danson doing his old Al Jolson makeup, blackface.  It's the big fucking deal.  Because anything you do now, if you do anything in blackface, it's automatically, if you have black person makeup on, associated with when blacks couldn't work so they had to use whites. 
[00:41:30]  So I guess men shouldn't dress up as women because at one point in the Greek theater, women were not allowed to be actors.  Right.  So it was only men playing women.  So I guess men shouldn't dress like girls either because it was a time where girls couldn't work as actors.  This story annoys me so much.  I'm never inviting Stephen S. from Bayshore to an Islanders game.  Wow.  I'm too outraged.  I can't do it.  There's Anthony in blackface.  That's outrageous.  Live at the Apollo, Anthony was in blackface.  It's the rock cut live at the Apollo album cover and we're all in blackface and there's the Saturn V rocket taking off the Apollo mission behind us. 
[00:42:00]  See, it's kind of a play on words and that whole thing.  But, I mean, stop.  Stop it.  By the way, David from Denver writes, Al Roker dressed up as a white guy this Halloween.  Yeah, exactly.  Did he really?  No, he didn't paint his skin but he had the fucking white guy wig on.  He played one of the Star Wars guys.  Well, you know what?  If you're going to be Han Solo or whatever, then he should have put white on his face to make himself white. 
[00:42:30]  You don't look authentic.  Or have Reggie Jackson wear the costume.  Yeah, that's it.  But wait until you get a little older and you can do that.  I love that black fade.  Yeah.  But wait, how can Al Roker, how can you wear a white man's hair?  I mean, how can you wear, what's the difference between the skin and the hair?  Why can you wear a white man's hair but not his skin?  It's so fucking stupid.  There he is.  Look, he's wearing white man Han Solo.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a douche.  Of course he is.  Fucking Al Roker, you suck.  Al Roker looks like such an idiot as Han Solo. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I hate you.  Oh, God.  I fucking hate you.  But the thing is, if you're going to dress for Halloween as a black person, a black celebrity,  a lot of people dress as celebrities for Halloween.  How many of the stupid John and Cates were out there?  They dress like fucking whatever the celebrity du jour is.  And if a white person wants to dress as a black celebrity and make the costume look authentic,  you need to color your skin with makeup the same color as the person you're trying to make yourself up as. 
[00:43:30]  And her costume was authentic.  Yeah.  It looked really good.  That wasn't some kind of degrading old fucking minstrel show bullshit thing.  I mean, she wasn't, I doubt she was walking around degrading black people.  Why is the minstrel thing so degrading?  I don't know.  I don't find it degrading either.  It was completely accepted.  It's part of history.  As a matter of fact, black people used to do minstrel shows and put the makeup on.  Right.  Because the skin wasn't like the old makeup. 
[00:44:00]  I know.  They would put the skin on.  It was a legitimate form of entertainment.  It really was.  What about all the nuns, Halloween costumes, pregnant nuns and all that?  Well, that's it.  There's no outrage there, but this.  Well, there's a little outrage.  Eh, really?  Eh.  This, the, I'm, come on.  This is, has everything to do with the black people.  Bill Donahue was outraged.  Who?  He said that.  He's a drunk.  I won't disagree.  That fucking Bill Donahue's a drunk.  All right, here's the rest of the story. 
[00:44:30]  Blu-Wayne.  Her pictures were leaked, posted on the web, and have been the target of discussion.  We showed some fans the pictures in question.  I don't know why anybody would take offense to it, first line.  Wouldn't it be okay to reverse?  What, what?  This is why the-  That's good, good.  Thank you, white person.  What'd she say?  She said, uh-  Wouldn't it be okay if it was reversed?  She goes, I wouldn't take any offense to that.  It's fine.  What, what, what, you know?  Why is the fucking media, this is why the media is so reprehensible.  Why are you trying to create a story by showing the photo to fans? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  God, are they fucking disgusting.  No one's outraged until the news takes the pictures around and goes, could you be outraged  at this, uh, so we could get your comments?  Stupid crackers.  Shut up.  Would they be-  Exactly.  Do they go around with the Wayne's Brothers movie poster and show that to fans and ask  if they were offended?  I'm offended.  Ah, fucking reporters are awful.  Wife chicks.  It's just awful.  Let's say hi to Jay in Texas.  Jay.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I just want to know, if you look on deadspin.com, there's pictures of Darren Williams, he's 
[00:45:30]  the black point guard from Utah Jazz, dressed as Calumpton Jr. for Halloween, all in white  face.  When was this?  This was on Halloween this year.  Yeah, of course.  Nobody ever heard or heard about it, never made a big deal, wasn't on the news.  Because, again, white, especially the white media, whether it's the fucking pussy, jaded  New York Times or other ones, will never call out blacks for racism, even though I don't  think he should be, but they just won't.  Because they have this fucking elitist, weird attitude, this paternalistic shit towards black 
[00:46:00]  people where they feel like they need their hands held, they need to be coddled like children,  they need to be handled with kid gloves.  It's fucking sickening.  Yeah, stop.  It's condescending.  You know, it's offensive.  Yeah, well, Tommy writes, minstrel shows were meant to make fun of black people and keep  them out of show business.  That's the difference.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Is that true, man?  Were they?  I don't know about that.  I heard that black people were involved in minstrel shows. 
[00:46:30]  You know, what are you going to do?  Maybe after a certain amount of time, but I think for a long time they weren't allowed  to act, so they just used white actors and blackface.  There's a difference between someone doing a minstrel show back in the fucking 20s,  and an attractive cheerleader wearing makeup on her skin that makes her look as if she  is an African-American at a Halloween party.  At a Halloween party.  Here's the second half of the story.  Reaction from fans was both mixed and varied, but one thing most everyone agreed on was 
[00:47:00]  that anyone who is representing America's team should exercise better judgment.  Better judgment than what?  Shut up.  What the fuck?  Why?  Better judgment than why?  What's wrong with it?  America's team, the Dallas Cowboys?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to go down the list of problems that the team has had?  Prisoners?  God, the fuck is me.  Should exercise better judgment.  Assuming that you would hold yourself up to a little bit more of a higher standard,  especially playing for the Cowboys and whatnot, but wow. 
[00:47:30]  Not much I can say about that one.  It speaks for itself.  Although no one from the Cowboys organization would comment on camera, we're told they are  addressing the situation.  For some fans, the only costume they want to see cheerleaders in are the ones they wear  on the field.  Why not just be yourself and be original?  Because nobody can be Lil Wayne.  Good point, idiots.  Great.  Great point on Halloween.  You stupid fuck.  Yeah, that's a dummy right now.  Yo, why would they dress up like white girls, the Wayans brothers? 
[00:48:00]  Why don't they just act like they sell?  Where was that comment?  What are you going as?  Someone employed?  Fucking shitheads.  Whoa!  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of it.  Yes, I can make jokes.  I know.  I can make stereotypical jokes.  That guy sounded like an ignorant fuck right there.  Now, why not be yourself?  Because it's Halloween, dummy.  That's the one day you get to not be yourself.  Holy shit, you moron.  One day you can live in some weird fantasy world.  Why not just be yourself? 
[00:48:30]  No one cares if you dress up with an axe like you just fucking hacked somebody's feet off.  Yeah, that's fine, too.  God, are we silly?  We've just reached a point.  It's just horrid.  Is anybody else being belligerent and going, fuck you back?  Nobody says it.  We do.  Fuck you back.  Fuck you back.  We should have fucking blackface day.  We should have fucking blackface day.  We should.  We should.  Just blackface day.  If we were for a company that would defend us, I would say you're absolutely right.  If I felt the company would back us up, I would say let's do that. 
[00:49:00]  And not just blackface, but we have to dress as a black celebrity and put together a very  good, realistic costume.  Where, you know, it's everything.  It's the clothing.  But in order to pull it off, you have to wear makeup on your skin to make yourself look  like an authentic celebrity.  Yeah, we'll rub duty on your face.  I'll be P. Diddy.  I want to be P. Diddy and put brown makeup all over my face.  Yeah.  And then wear like the white tuxedo thing because he has the white parties. 
[00:49:30]  So I want to do that.  I'll be P. Diddy.  Who would you be?  I want to be Flavor Flay.  You can be Flavor Flay.  That's out.  That's old school, but it's cool.  Well, I saw a black hockey player last night in the Islander game.  No, you didn't.  Hell fucking yeah, I did.  Was it makeup?  Is he in trouble?  No, he plays for the Sabres.  Yeah?  And I had a tweet about it.  Wow.  And then a lot of people said, I expect this from Anthony, not you.  Oh.  I'm like, I was just surprised.  It's always, it kind of throws you off a little bit when you watch hockey and all of a sudden 
[00:50:00]  you see a black guy.  I'm sorry.  You know, Kevin from Connecticut can't even spell.  He's spelled dress up as Lazy.  It's Jay-Z.  Stop it.  My God.  Blackface Day.  You know, and do not call it Blackface Day.  Why don't we encourage our listeners to go to work on Blackface Day in minstrel makeup?  In minstrel makeup.  No, no, as a black celebrity.  Because minstrel makeup is offensive. 
[00:50:30]  Because people will say that was the offensive thing.  And that brings back and conjures up the racism and imagery of the days where, but just like  black celebrities of today.  I want to be Morgan Freeman.  All right.  And I want to get those black freckles working.  Make some.  I got some freckles.  So I'll just call them in.  Black freckles around your eyes.  I'll call them in.  And you can be Morgan Freeman.  Powder your hair white.  Yeah.  Like his.  Everything will be fine.  Can we send out a press release?  You can do that.  Have the boys in PR send out a press release.  We're having Blackface Day in the opening of the show. 
[00:51:00]  We'll do that.  And we'll dress up, uh, who wants to be Reverend Al?  Iraq?  I'd love to be Reverend.  Oh, yeah.  He's fat enough.  Reverend Al would be a good one.  Don't take my Morgan Freeman.  I like that idea.  That's a good one.  I'm going to be Jesse Jackson.  And no one's going to know who's the Morgan and who's Jesse.  We're both going to be two fucking white guys with wigs and awful mustaches.  It's just.  Hold on, man.  I got some.  What would management say?  Say.  Yeah.  That would.  That could be a problem. 
[00:51:30]  They would never sign off on anything like that.  Oh, my God.  Would it be the worst?  How about reverse the race day?  Yeah.  We have a couple of our black friends in and they can dress up as any white celebrity.  A white celebrity.  Right.  I just don't see the problem in dressing up as a celebrity that is black and actually making the authentic skin color.  Can I change mine?  Yeah.  In honor of the Yankees winning, I want to be.  I'm going to go old school.  I want to be Mickey Rivers. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  You are going to need some makeup, my friend.  Can after can of spray paint.  You are going to need some makeup.  Was he the darkest celebrity?  The darkest athlete ever?  He was.  Let's play who was the darkest athlete ever today.  Who did they put the camera on last night?  We were laughing about that.  I'm going with Mickey Rivers.  Anybody have someone else that could be blacker than Mickey Rivers?  Blackest athlete ever.  Club Soda Kenny could go as Manute Bull. 
[00:52:30]  Manute Bull was pretty damn black.  Manute Bull was a black athlete.  Who was the blackest athlete ever?  For real.  That's the question today.  Actual skin tone?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, first, let's preface it by who was the whitest?  I'd say Larry Bird.  He was very pale.  Okay, good.  That's out of the way.  Yeah, that's out of the way.  Now we can do the other way.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to...  Even though you're going with a joke there and I love it... 
[00:53:00]  No, I'm just going with a bail us out.  No, I understand that.  Because we're doing both sides.  There's something to be said, because who was the whitest athlete ever, too?  Who was the whitest athlete?  Because there's some good ones out there as well.  Larry Bird was pretty fucking white.  He was like reddish white.  There's some like fucking right off the boat Irish dudes that won't beat Larry Bird.  Oh, yeah.  All right, there's your question today.  Blackest athlete ever, whitest athlete ever.  Whitest. 
[00:53:30]  Carl Herrera.  Who's Carl?  Sean Bradley.  I'm just...  Steve Nash.  Bruce Smith.  I was going to say Bruce Smith.  Yes.  Reggie Jackson is both.  Bruce Smith.  That's very funny.  Get a picture of Bruce Smith.  He's up there.  He might be...  Bruce Smith could be the whitest.  He might give Manu Boll a run for his money.  And Dexter Manley, yes, of the Washington Redskins.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Matt Suey is fucking...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Bruce was up there, man.  Good old Bruce. 
[00:54:00]  And let's not forget Mickey Rivers.  I threw that out there as a goof, but Mickey's up there.  Mickey Rivers.  Willie Wilson from the fucking Royals.  Oh, wow.  You can't even see him.  Mickey Rivers wasn't allowed to play at night games.  They went to someone last night in the dugout, and you couldn't even see who they were.  It was a black guy sitting on the bench.  I didn't know who it was.  You couldn't see him.  You saw a uniform without a head.  Thank you, Fletcher and Jersey.  Yes, Sean Bradley.  Look up Sean Bradley. 
[00:54:30]  Now we're going whitest.  Sean Bradley was a white dude, man.  Look how white Sean Bradley was.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  He's as white as his Dallas uniform.  That is white.  Yeah.  He was pretty much a bust.  I think he was like seven fucking, what was he, seven, let me think.  Sean Bradley was probably seven six.  Really?  He was up there.  He is a big one.  And speaking of tall.  Yeah.  There's a high school kid that they said shouldn't play football because he could die. 
[00:55:00]  He's the tallest teenager in America.  He's seven five, that guy.  Oh, you saw it, right?  Yeah.  He's seven five.  You got to see the footage of him in his football uniform.  Like no one could cover the guy.  Really?  He can't run is the problem.  Yeah.  So they kind of got to wait for him to kind of walk into position and then they throw the ball.  Holy shit.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, my God.  Look how much bigger he is than everybody else on the field.  That's crazy.  He was on Oprah.  Is there a video of this guy?  But the problem is he can't run.  World's tallest teenager lives football dreams. 
[00:55:30]  They said if he plays football, he could die.  He has tumors on his body.  I handed off that ball to you.  They was coming after me.  Willie McGee, yes.  Patrick Ewing.  Yeah, Patrick Ewing.  All right.  Yeah, he's got some kind of tall guy disease.  Fuck.  I like to play football.  A lot of fun.  I'm just like a regular kid. 
[00:56:00]  Rich in Orlando ends the contest.  I forgot about this guy.  Go ahead, Rich.  Oil can boy.  The guy with an inkblot and a baseball uniform.  Oh, that guy was crazy, too.  Let's go with oil can boy.  Oil can was crazy and shit.  Who's the blackest so far?  Manute Bull?  Beating out Mickey Rivers and Bruce Smith?  I don't know.  Oil can, man.  Oil can boy.  Well.  Oh, see, he's one of those guys that's.  I don't see him, though.  I had his card as a kid when I was collecting baseball cards. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  The guy was basically a freaking pair of teeth, an inkblot, and a baseball cap.  All right.  That's all.  I mean, he was the blackest guy I've ever seen in my life.  What years did he play, Oil can boy?  He was dumb.  Oh, God.  He was in the.  He played in the 80s.  He did?  Did he make it to 90s?  He played for like Montreal or something.  He played for the Red Sox for a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  John Stockton, he's got the dark hair, which throws it off.  Yeah, a little bit.  So.  Yeah, no, no.  That other guy had it for whitest. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Mr. Coffee.  Right on.  Mr. Coffee, South Carolina.  What's up, brother?  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I just wanted to enter the contest, and I want to be Miss Teaches.  Woo!  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  So the fried chicken finger lick.  You hear me?  You hear me?  You hear me?  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  Yeah.  So the fried chicken finger lick.  Get fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken. 
[00:57:30]  She's in the woods just frying up that chicken.  I don't know.  That's very good.  Thank you.  Oh, he's gone.  Okay.  Want to take our first break?  Hells yeah.  All right.  Yeah, the Lindsay Lohan audio is good.  We're going to play that next.  All righty.  Yeah, there seems to be a problem with that.  Well, her father.  Ugh.  Ugh.  We'll get into it.  Yeah.  We got a busy day.  Yes, we do. 
[00:58:00]  Bill Burr will be here at 8.  Bob Kelly and Dane Cook will be here at 8.30.  Nice.  And Jimmy's going to Houston today.  I am for the improv.  Who's there?  To do some improv shows.  Tonight, tomorrow and Saturday.  You're going to do some improv?  Yeah.  I do.  I bring a person up on stage and I sit them there on the chair.  And I make them say, all right, name a Houston mayor.  And when they name it, I do something from his inaugural speech while you sit there in the chair.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Oh.  I can only go back 178 years. 
[00:58:30]  So don't try to stump me.  I'm unstumpable with Houston mayor trivia.  I want to hear that.  And Ann, you got a story in you, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ann's got it.  All right.  I have a check in Ann.  It's still, you know, it's still ongoing.  Ann's got a good story in him.  It's still ongoing.  You want to tell your little story after the break?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I'll do a little checking, a little recon, and then I'll get it out.  Pretty good story.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Is this for Matt Sui?  Aye.  Oh, fuck it.  Let's listen to some fucking vocals today, Ann.  What do you say?  Yeah.  Take it right here, Ann.  And go.  With a pulse of a little grimace and a terrible sound, it pulls the spirit.  My attention wires down.  Woo.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Everybody.  Helpless people on subway trains.  Scream for God as he looks in on them.  Rock.  Freedom rock.  Yeah.  Get some of us and he goes back down.  As he wades through the buildings on the center of town.  This is for Matt Sui.  They don't play this when he comes out, do they?  Hey, he's got to go.  Go, go, Godzilla.  Nice.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Good fucking pick there, Travis.  Loving it.  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be for Matt Sui because we don't have that in the repertoire.  And I didn't think the vocals were actually going to kick in.  I don't think that was a bad, yeah.  A few people want to know if Reverend Al will get involved with that Dallas cheerleader story.  He better not.  All depends.  He better not.  I'm going to predict fired, so fired.  Of course.  Which is ridiculous.  Of course.  But I'm going to say fired. 
[01:00:30]  It's fucking ridiculous.  That's the solution to everything.  It's so PC.  Dude, you're talking about the NFL.  Fired, so fired.  Fired, so fired.  Unjustly fired, so fired.  I don't know about that because it was a Halloween costume and she was playing.  I don't say no.  She was dressed as Lil Wayne.  I don't think a firing is justified.  I mean, we all know that, but I don't even think.  Half the firings aren't justified.  But I mean, even in that situation, I don't think they can justify it.  Fire.  All these dumb firings aren't justified.  Nope. 
[01:01:00]  That's the problem.  I'm telling you.  I'm going to answer.  Fired, so fired.  Fired, so fired.  Reverend Al, la, la, la.  And story.  Oh, really fast because it's old business.  You know we did that Jocktober thing?  Yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut is becoming a nice source for this radio show.  He tweeted me some outtakes.  You know this Dan Ingram?  And you know anything about Dan Ingram?  Dan Ingram.  Was he A-B-C?  Dan Ingram.  Go, go, go.  Dan Ingram.  Yes, all his jingles. 
[01:01:30]  You remember the Dan Ingram jingle?  Yeah.  I don't even remember what I had for breakfast yesterday.  He was one of those Echo Jock guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm just trying to be a little funny on the show.  I appreciate the laugh.  Oh, he was one of those, yeah, boss jock kind of, you know, Echo.  Was it ABC?  Yeah, I think so.  Fuck, you remember the jingles.  Whoa, what's that?  Well, I'm sorry and I want to apologize. 
[01:02:00]  I need the ring on today, the bing, because there's like, I got to keep track of something.  Yeah, well, that leads into your story in a minute or two, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's got a story.  We're going to sit around and listen to Anthony tell a little story.  Well.  Do we get milk and cookies for your story?  Milk and cookies.  So, Dan Ingram, the key to this is he's a jock.  He's like a boss jock.  Boss jock.  He's a boring jock, really.  Even though he gets some kind of weird respect in the business. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know why.  Because he was there, like, in the old days.  Who gives a shit?  He spun records.  Yeah, for some reason that was big back then.  Like, it really was.  It was a big deal back then to be one of those jocks.  Wow.  You were big.  You fucking went in front of giant crowds of people at concerts, and people just cheered and loved you.  And they thought you were the greatest shit.  Now you're just shit.  Going backwards a little bit.  Rockstar China from, actually, Dongguan, China.  Wow.  They wouldn't let Rush buy a team. 
[01:03:00]  She's fired.  Yeah.  God, that is so perfect.  It's a whole black.  Yeah, you know what?  That is a good point.  It's a whole black-white thing.  She's so fired.  Yeah, so fired.  Got to keep everyone calm.  So fired.  If they fired, let's see if the other cheerleaders or anybody comes to her defense.  What?  What?  Of course they won't.  Every time we got fired, the people you worked with made believe they didn't even know you.  How many times has that happened?  Holy underwear.  We got to keep our phony baloney jobs.  That is exactly what they'll do. 
[01:03:30]  What's that from?  Blazing Saddles.  What?  Yeah.  I should have got that one.  What scene?  When they were in his office talking about getting the railroad through.  Wow.  Fucking good call, I guess.  That's an old one.  Fucking media creating that story.  Yeah, yeah.  I just hate them.  They love stirring it up.  The race thing.  Stir it up.  They're not legitimate.  God, they're just shit in this country.  Make the story.  They're shit.  They're as bad as they are in England with the tabloids.  Horrid.  And this is quote-unquote legitimate media.  We showed the picture to a couple of fans. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  How is that news?  It ain't.  I'm going to start following them around with a fucking camera.  But why would you?  Is that not a story?  And turn to your right.  Here's your morning look.  So happy together.  So happy together.  We're happy together.  So happy together.  On and dancing.  Happy together.  So happy together. 
[01:04:30]  Nice to see a show get along like that.  So happy together.  They protect their girl.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, that's the morning mash-up walking by our window.  They just walk around together at all fucking times.  And yes, Ron and Fez did come to our defense.  And we're right there with us.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think they would do it differently.  Now that they know what happened to them.  Ah, screw that, Fez.  Fuck those guys, Fez.  I agree with their firing. 
[01:05:00]  So Dan Ingram, Jocktober.  Yeah.  Guy who played records.  Well, he had to do some commercials.  And Kevin from Connecticut sent me a couple outtakes from Dan Ingram.  Would you like to hear these in?  I certainly would.  Here's the first one.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Let me...  All right, so we just set up a bit for 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And we have no fucking payoff.  And you press the button.  Are you fucking...  Ow!  What was that?  I don't know.  We've been electrocuted. 
[01:05:30]  Let's try this again.  Yeah.  All right.  Whose head?  Whose head rolls?  Who recorded it?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Travis has them, which is fine.  But we have to get to the bottom of that.  I want to play...  Whose handwriting is that?  Pass the buck.  Is there a track list on it?  Oh, it looks like Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Are the tracks listed?  Yes.  There's no tracks listed.  That's Sam's trademark.  I thought it was Sam's handwriting.  Someone's...  Oh, he's there.  It's E-Rock. 
[01:06:00]  It's got to be E-Rock.  E-Rock, that was another one.  Is it another data disk?  He did it the other day.  Yep.  Same fucking thing.  All right, Travis, give me the first one.  Dan Ingram outtakes.  This wasn't supposed to take all day.  This was supposed to be a quickie, so then we could segue to Anthony's story.  Dust it for mayo.  Oh.  We have a morning store for kids today.  Growing up in every way.  When you make Macy's and Bambergers your first assignment, it's the great look of Sanson  for back to school.  You'll love Sanson cords, jeans, and fashion denims. 
[01:06:30]  Top it off with Sanson sweatshirt.  Sanson shit.  Fuck this smile on your face, huh?  Fuck you, bro.  That's the way you store it for me.  The music.  Wow.  Did he just say smile on your face?  Dan's a nasty, nasty boy.  Dirty language.  Shit.  Fuck this.  I do that, though, too.  When you trip up, you go like, fuck shit.  Cock fuck.  Bambergers.  How old is this that he mentioned Bambergers?  Bambergers.  Did your parents get you stuff from Bambergers for your birthday? 
[01:07:00]  What's Bambergers?  You remember Bambergers?  You'd get a Van Heusen shirt there.  The name sounds familiar, but I don't really remember.  It's like Alexander's.  It's like one of those two guys store.  It was terrible.  Bambergers.  Bambergers.  My mother was a floor manager at Bambergers.  She was fired for definitely getting in the stock room.  It's a long story.  Ah, god damn it.  She was all over the paper.  Beverly Sheckler fired.  Beverly Sheckler.  Another piece of the puzzle. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  We like getting a piece of the puzzle.  That is very cool.  I never knew what Ted's mom's name was.  Beverly Sheckler.  Beverly.  Remember that, people.  You never remember.  Bambergers.  Oh, they're going to remember.  You want another one?  I think I have one more from Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes.  Hit it, Travis.  Watch them grow.  There's so much in store for you.  It's a song for Young Cut at Macy's and Bambergers.  We're a part of your night.  For Young Cut.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  You want to learn how to fuck?  Get on your hands and knees.  Let me put the KY on your ass, honey.  Holy shit.  He's a dirty boy.  And it's funny.  That was an actual copy of what they wanted.  Right.  Available at all Corvette stores.  Yes, Corvette.  Yes.  I just saw that one.  Come to Gimbles.  Remember Gimbles?  Yes.  Gimbles, I remember that one.  There was like Gimbles and Macy's where the big...  Yeah, what happened to Gimbles?  The big two went bye-bye.  Macy's still fucking hanging in there, though.  Nowadays, Gimbles would like get bailed out by the government. 
[01:08:30]  The fucking government would own it.  We can't let Gimbles go away.  We need Gimbles.  Bye-bye.  Shacklers were humiliated.  Everybody's connected.  He was talking about my mother and her alleged defecation in the stockroom.  Of where?  Schenectady.  What store?  Bam Burgers.  Beverly Shackler fired from Bam Burgers. 
[01:09:00]  Bam Burgers.  It wasn't true.  It was a lie.  Somebody planted a duty and blamed my mother.  Did you get goofed on in school about that?  I certainly did.  Well, it must have been embarrassing.  Yes, every time there was a duty on the court, they would point and go, Theodore, has your  mother been here?  I would say, that's a lie.  She did not defecate in the stockroom.  Bam Burgers.  She was a railroading.  Bam Burgers.  Going back to yesterday, Dirty Ralph, I think that guy's face seen all over the world is Ted 
[01:09:30]  Sheckler.  Ah.  Huh?  Kind of does.  He has a mustache and everything.  Have you dreamt of this?  Do you have a little story for everybody?  Well, of course, yeah.  Caldor, yes.  Yeah.  Another fun.  I worked there.  Caldor was good.  Two years.  Caldor.  Yeah, well, I know.  Every year.  The stockroom.  Yeah.  Marshalls.  Hmm.  That's still around, though.  Yeah.  Sterns.  Woo-hoo. 
[01:10:00]  What is he bitching about today?  Oh, it's just a bunch of inventions in that place.  It's great.  You can buy them.  It gets them so bothered.  Yeah, I had a very interesting...  Yes, Anthony.  Actually, interesting few days.  I haven't got much sleep or anything.  There's like, you know, a girl over the house, you know.  You know how that goes, right?  When you're a single successful guy, like me working at the burger place. 
[01:10:30]  You know, so, girl over the house.  And apparently she has asthma.  She's got asthma.  Oof.  Out of nowhere.  I'll give you asthma.  You're going to dress your playing golf today.  Are you dating...  What about my asthma?  I'll give you asthma.  Are you dating preemies at this point?  No.  Lungs aren't fully developed?  No. 
[01:11:00]  That's not...  No.  No.  Do you have an incubator in your fucking compound?  No.  I don't have an incubator.  Probably not asthma.  It's probably just gasping at your political ideologies.  Well, that's true.  They do smell the old...  No, no.  You're dating so young, their lungs aren't fully developed.  No.  It's not like that.  Sorry.  It's just...  It's asthma.  It's asthma.  And...  I'll give you asthma.  It's...  I'll give you asthma.  And it's just gotten kind of worse over the past couple of days. 
[01:11:30]  Well, that's not good.  So, you know, she hasn't been able to go back home.  Um, you know, she lives out of state.  She hasn't been able to go back home.  Thailand?  And...  No, not Thailand.  So, uh, last night, um, it was time to...  I haven't gotten any sleep, by the way.  I'm exhausted.  I'm tripping over myself.  Uh, had to take her to the emergency room. 
[01:12:00]  My favorite place to go.  What time?  To take her.  So, this was about 1.30 in the morning.  Were you asleep?  No.  No, I was still awake because, you know, the asthma...  The aches won and stuff.  Like that and things, you know.  Yeah.  It's just one of those things.  So, it was time to, you know, go to the emergency room.  How far are you from the hospital?  Uh, it's not far.  Okay.  It's a few exits.  Not bad.  Um, so, we go there and, uh, you know, you'd go through all that paperwork stuff. 
[01:12:30]  That, you know, she's going through all the paperwork and everything like that.  It takes forever.  And then...  Is she going through the, uh, because this fucking frustrates the shit out of me.  Yeah.  Is she filling out her paperwork as she's gasping for air?  Well, she's not gasping for air, but...  Because the emergency room is, is wonderful when it comes to that.  Make sure the paperwork is done before we...  Yeah.  ...even acknowledge that you're dying right in front of our eyes.  I know.  It really is horrible.  When I had the worst allergy attack of my life where I really thought I was, like, minutes  from dying, they had to make sure I had all my fucking paperwork. 
[01:13:00]  I had a pounding headache.  My headache was so bad.  Sorry, Anthony.  But it drives me fucking nuts.  I couldn't even see the form anymore.  That's how bad I was.  And I'm like, will you just take care of this and then we'll worry about the stupid paperwork.  Oh, they want to know your fucking...  They need the paperwork immediately.  They want to know they're getting paid, motherfucker.  Sorry.  It's one of my fucking pet peeves in this world.  The stupid emergency room and their dumb paperwork first.  Filling out the paperwork.  I'm sorry.  I'll shut up.  No, no.  They're filling out the paperwork.  And then it's time to, you know, go into the emergency room portion of the hospital. 
[01:13:30]  Now, I've, you know, dealt with that before in the past.  Um, but, uh, this was a little embarrassing.  They, they took her into pediatrics.  Do you know there's a whole nother emergency room for pediatrics? 
[01:14:00]  And they brought her in there and, um, there's little paintings on the walls and, and paper,  like, like ducks and stuff all over the place.  I can't even look at you.  And there's little kids walking around and a baby was crying and, and, and, and, and she's in pediatrics.  And, and the doctor asked me like, you know, oh, okay, who are you?  And I'm just like, a friend.  And I was, I've never felt like the creep that I know I am, but I've never actually felt it. 
[01:14:30]  Who are you?  A friend.  I'm a friend.  I'm a friend.  I've never even seen that part of a hospital.  And, and, and I'm sitting in this little chair.  Right.  And, and I'm looking at like a child's rights in the hospital.  And, and it says things like, please tell me if it's going to hurt. 
[01:15:00]  I'll be okay with it.  And, uh, please, um, um, uh, give me a hug.  I could use it.  Let me take my toy wherever I'm going in the hospital.  But I'm reading signs like this and looking at paper fucking mobiles of ducks and geese.  All right.  You know, you, you brought this to the show.  I know.  You just threw yourself under the bus.  It was so embarrassing.  Eric at Virginia Tech.  Wow.  A pediatric and a geriatric. 
[01:15:30]  Pediatric.  And I noticed there was like, there was a, a cabinet with, with games in it.  All kinds of games.  I'm in the fucking pediatric ward.  And, and, you know, uh, the, the, the girl there, she's, she's tall and her feet were  hanging off at the end of the frigging pediatric bed.  I felt so bad.  And I felt like such a ghoul. 
[01:16:00]  Just because they're tall doesn't make it okay.  No, no.  I under, I understand.  I understand.  Did you take advantage of the situation and get some speed dating in while they were,  while they were running her through the test?  There was, there was, there was a white girl that got up and she's holding the back of  her gown shut and she had to be about 16 or 17 to go give a urine sample.  She was pretty cute.  I must say.  But, you know, I, I, I, I put my head down the whole time.  I just felt like. 
[01:16:30]  Were you ashamed and embarrassed?  Dude.  I was completely ashamed and embarrassed.  You were a celebrity.  Yeah.  Finally, you were ashamed.  I, I, it, it finally took.  It's not bad for you to have a little shame finally.  To go to the emergency room.  Yeah.  And have, uh, uh, a girl that's been, you know, staying at the house cause she's, she's sick,  uh, and, and can't, you know, can't make it back home in, in that state with the, uh,  the, uh, the asthma.  Uh.  Did you just pay cash?  Pediatrics.  Did you just pay cash for the.  No, she's, she's insured. 
[01:17:00]  She's got insurance.  Did she have to call her God?  God, her insurance number.  No, she's got insurance.  Oh, my gosh.  But it's like.  What the fuck?  It's like pediatrics.  So then they, they actually, um, admit, admitted her.  And, um, they didn't put her in the regular room wing.  And now she's in the pediatrics part of the hospital.  So not only the emergency room is pediatrics, but she's in a pediatric room, which can only 
[01:17:30]  mean, um, when I do go there, she's probably sharing the room with some child, you know.  With some child with a broken leg.  The first broken bone.  It's just, it really is.  I've never felt so ghoulish in my life.  Well, let's start with this.  Tony in Iowa.  Very good question.  Did she get a sticker after her boo-boo was gone?  Boo-boo.  No, there wasn't a giraffe, uh, gurney. 
[01:18:00]  A giraffe hippopotamus monkey gurney.  Yeah, Eric, once again, for Virginia Tech, kind of reworking my line, but it's true.  Just because she doesn't have to be on her tippy toes doesn't make it okay.  Ah.  What her.  It's, uh, did they give her a lollipop after she let, no.  But, oh, look at there's a castle, gurney.  It's like you're in the castle.  Like you're a little princess.  In a castle.  Thank you, Danny, for popping up these embarrassing pictures.  And then some curmudgeon has to point out princesses don't have catheters. 
[01:18:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  And you were actually in the pedo-atric ward.  No.  That bitch.  Danny's the worst.  It's a little kid in a hospital gown that's dragging on the floor.  You know they said that girl's father is creepy when they saw you.  No, because that's the worst, that's another bad part, too, because they have to ask her all bunch of questions, and I guess they asked her if she was sexually active, and, you know, she had to say yes. 
[01:19:00]  And then.  Why do they want to know that?  Somehow I got brought into the conversation.  Why do they want to know that?  They always ask, you know, people in pediatrics that, you know.  And then I think they asked her if her parents knew.  Did you get some creepy looks?  Let's be honest.  Let's get right to it.  What were the looks you were getting?  Yeah, I think I really, the doctor was giving me some really creepy looks, and the nurses and stuff didn't even want to acknowledge I was there. 
[01:19:30]  Why would they?  You're a filthy shock jock.  You fucking scum of the earth.  You horrible child spoiler.  That's what I was.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I hope whoever, ah, fuck, it's feedback, forget it.  Everybody wants in on this one.  I hope whoever was working the desk recognized Ant and put her in pediatrics just to fuck with Ant.  No, they put her right in there.  Wow.  Pediatric is nothing.  I've never been so mortified. 
[01:20:00]  Were you embarrassed?  At being with a younger lady than when she had to be admitted to pediatrics.  Yes, yes.  And I've been in some weird situations where, of course, there'd be, you know, you know, hey, that must be, you know, your dad or something.  That's never good, but I get a good laugh out of that.  Who cares?  But pediatrics.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  She is, you know, of age.  Definitely. 
[01:20:30]  I was wondering the same thing.  Like, why admit somebody of that age?  I think because pediatrics includes the 18th year.  Does it?  Yeah, I remember when I was 18 and I was, when I went to the doctor, I still had to go to the pediatrician at 18.  And I felt so, because, like, I'm sitting there and there's kids' toys, you know, where they play with those beads that go along the track, the wire track.  And I'm sitting there like, why am I here?  Like, I'm wearing a Metallica T-shirt.  And I'm like, come on.  Drunk and playing with an abacus. 
[01:21:00]  You're in pediatrics.  Scott from Quakertown.  So now you have to go pick her up from Child Protective Services today, Ed?  No.  Do you have to sit with a dyphus counselor with your chick?  Look, she's completely of age, an adult.  But, you know, for some reason they put her in pediatrics.  Let's go to Chris in PA.  Chris.  Hey, Ed, did you guys sit at the little Lego table and build your future dream house together?  She likes Legos. 
[01:21:30]  She's going to look like it.  What am I going to do?  Wow.  You know.  Well, are you, whoa, are you okay?  I just feel bad because, you know, she's in there and, you know.  Are you okay if I take that phone call?  I can't believe I'm using restraint.  I can't see with the thing in the way.  That would be burp.  Oh, my God.  No, that's horrible. 
[01:22:00]  I got to show some restraint.  Poor girl's in the hospital.  It was a burp joke.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  I don't want to make fun, but it's just, actually, I'm not making fun of the fact that, you know,  you're a badass man.  She went into the hospital.  I'm making light of the fact that I am such a fucking god-awful creep.  And to finally see it staring back at me in the mirror.  She's still in there?  Is she all right?  Yeah, she's still in there.  You know, they got to make sure, you know, they do tests and everything and see what kind 
[01:22:30]  of medication works better.  Because she's got, you know, the inhaler and stuff like that.  Right.  But, yeah, that's not doing the trick, so.  Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Yeah, I am.  Were you kind of worried that you might bump into one of your exes there?  In pediatrics?  Oh.  I mean, you're doing a repeat offender and all, you know.  Oh, my God.  A repeat offender.  I never date underage girls. 
[01:23:00]  Well.  Well.  Well.  Not.  That's right.  Not now.  You know you're fucking playing with fire when before you go away you have to check the  state laws?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  You got to make sure, you know, but.  Uh-huh.  Ah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Some of these guys are going brutal with this.  Fucking uncomfortably brutal.  Well.  I didn't expect pediatrics. 
[01:23:30]  That threw me for a bit of a loop.  Yeah.  But I got to tell you.  No crowd.  They get right to you.  It's pretty good.  We had to walk through.  We had to walk through the regular emergency room area to get to the pediatric one.  And there's some woman yelling.  But what's her blood pressure?  Like some.  I guess some woman and her mother were there.  And the mother's some old bag.  And she's in there with, you know, getting her blood pressure taken.  And this woman's yelling at a nurse. 
[01:24:00]  And she goes.  You asked me three times already.  And I told you.  Well, what is it?  And it's just like pandemonium.  And then.  And then we go into pediatrics.  And it's like.  Oh, this is nice.  Wow.  There's only a few rooms.  There's no commotions going on.  Everyone's nice.  But why is.  A person who's of age legally.  Why are they asking.  Does your family know if you're sexually active?  I don't know.  She's old enough.  I know how old she is.  She's old enough legally.  Oh, I don't think.  To join the military.  To be executed in every state. 
[01:24:30]  It's.  I don't think.  They were asking.  Does your.  Does your family know if you're sexually active?  I think they were asking.  Does your family know.  That.  You're.  With an old.  Old ghoul.  But again.  That's none of that fucking business.  She's a legal adult.  Well, it certainly isn't.  None of that fucking business.  You know.  I guess they wanted to know if I was.  You know.  Again.  None of that.  They wanted to satisfy their own curiosity.  Yeah.  That's all that is.  Yeah.  Boy, that really did kind of.  Teddy from New York writes. 
[01:25:00]  Right now.  She's talking to the social worker.  They're asking her to show them where the bad man touched her.  You shut the fuck up.  And no, I didn't take her there in a car seat.  You fucking people.  Let's say hi to Scott in Chattanooga.  Show us on the doll where he touched her.  Yeah.  Scott.  Chattanooga.  Hey.  While you were waiting.  Did you get caught up on all those Spongebob?  What episodes you missed?  No.  There wasn't Spongebob on the TV.  Nice.  There aren't many pediatric patients at that hour in the morning for some reason. 
[01:25:30]  You know.  I guess kids ain't up.  Yeah.  They're sleeping.  They can get a little baby aspirin or something and they're fine until the morning.  But I do have to get back there at some point.  To the whole pediatric ward.  Now I go in too.  I get to walk in there and be a complete creep all over again. 
[01:26:00]  Hi.  I can picture Anthony saying hi.  Like peeking at him.  They went, hi.  Embarrassing.  Kind of creepy.  The roommate kid starts crying.  Hey.  Yeah.  So you had a rusher there in the middle of the night?  Well, it wasn't like a rush job, you know.  It wasn't like that.  But, you know, you get a little concerned.  Sure.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  I was going to suck.  Yeah.  People want to know if she brought her blankie.  They give them blankies there.  Thank you very much. 
[01:26:30]  Well, she probably wants her blankie.  Psychotic, right?  Did Chris Hansen tell you to take a seat in the waiting room to have some lemonade and  a cookie?  That is horrible.  So, you've come to the emergency room.  Why don't you sit down?  All right.  You're free to go.  The cops put their knee in my neck in the hallway.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Morning.  Morning, Larry. 
[01:27:00]  Hey, Anthony, how important is the age of consent?  Very.  Very important.  So, the nurses...  Are you sure nobody would talk to you?  No, they kind of talked to me.  Yeah.  Standoffishly.  I was sitting in the room at one point when the doctor came in, and he goes,  Well, we're just going to, you know, ask her a few questions.  Who are you?  And I said, I'm a friend.  And he goes, All right, you'll have to step out of the room. 
[01:27:30]  And I had to get up and just kind of skulk out of the room like a fucking...  Is that the way it would be, though, with anyone, or no?  Horrible guy.  I would guess so.  Oh, yeah.  For the most family.  Yeah, for the most part.  You know, especially in pediatrics.  It's horrible.  Anthony Polanski.  Let me say hi to Corinne in Jersey.  When Ant walked into pediatrics, did the whole staff yell, Norm! 
[01:28:00]  Anthony Glitter.  All right.  Yes.  Let's go to Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne.  Ant, I want to know, are you going to take her to Toys R Us when she gets discharged  for being such a brave big girl?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to do that.  And Corinne knows how to call a radio show.  She's gone.  Let me say hi to your favorite therapist.  Oh, no.  Lydia from Oceanside.  Oh, Christ.  Hello, Lydia.  Hi, boys. 
[01:28:30]  Hi, Lydia.  You're laughing today, aren't you, Lydia?  What's my problem now, Lydia?  Well, let's listen in.  Lydia knows a thing or two about creeps.  Go ahead, Lydia.  I've been really trying to lay off Anthony.  I let the panic room go.  All the dreams.  The drunken Halloween party.  But you yourself said that maybe you needed to look at your life. 
[01:29:00]  No, I didn't say that.  I said I felt like a creep.  Do I really care?  Eh, not really.  Once I was out of there, I was fine.  I mean, it's just being in there is a little awkward, you know, because it's pediatrics.  But Anthony's not doing anything wrong by dating somebody younger.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's who he likes to date.  Yeah.  There is nothing wrong with being with someone younger.  Absolutely not.  There is something wrong with avoiding people of a certain age because you can't connect with people on an adult level. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, so?  I can't.  I don't like people my own age.  They're stupid and not fun.  Yeah.  But you're about to find your own age.  You know what was really odd?  Being in there and they started, like, in the triage area, they took our blood pressure.  And I was like, I was just talking today about the blood pressure thing being around my heart on. 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  You should have told them that.  And there it was.  Yeah.  That would have really, that would have upped the creep factor.  You know, let me tell you a cute little dream I had last night.  Just only a mere few days ago.  But it was so odd.  No, it was that day.  That day, you're right, you're right.  I was talking about it.  And then there I was looking at the blood pressure thing going, wow, that's a weird coincidence.  Yep.  I haven't seen one of those in a while.  And there I am, right there, looking at that.  Well, what do you got, Lydia? 
[01:30:30]  Anything else?  You're not really delving into this one.  I guess I want to tell Anthony not to talk about the dreams in the panic room when he takes his young girlfriend to the ER  because the psych ER is probably right next door.  Oh, don't even worry about it.  I'm fine mentally.  There's nothing wrong with an older man liking young broads because he doesn't want to connect with an older broad.  There's nothing wrong with that.  All they do is fucking bitch and complain.  Listen, everyone wishes he was you, Anthony. 
[01:31:00]  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  I guess I'm just worried about the total picture, the panic room, the dream.  It's not a panic room as much as it's a gun safe, but it's big so, you know, you could fit in it.  It's a secure place.  See, I'm being responsible.  It's a secure place for firearms that is alarmed and locked with an electronic lock.  And if, you know, I'm in there, I would be locked in there, but I could then get out whenever I wanted to. 
[01:31:30]  What's wrong with that in this day and age of crime and crime?  Well, you know what?  I don't want to constantly lay into you for the same old things.  I just wish you would consider maybe checking out eHarmony or something like that.  eHarmony?  You know what?  That fucking commercial creeps me out.  You ever see the one with the fucking laughing Asian girl on the beach with her dog?  That has got to be the creepiest fucking bitch I've ever seen. 
[01:32:00]  And she's looking at the camera, petting her dog on the beach, and it's black and white.  And then she goes, he, he, he, he, he, he.  And then to like five seconds later, she goes, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.  It's like, who wants to date that fucking nut?  Lunatics.  Speaking of dating sites, my bro-in-law first tweeted it, and Joe Rogan tweeted it, I think two days ago.  So it's a montage of a video dating site of all these fucking loser guys from the 70s trying to put their best foot forward. 
[01:32:30]  That's a good one.  Can you find that?  I know Joe Rogan tweets a lot, so it might be a little tough, but JoeRogan.net, I think it is on Twitter, if I'm not mistaken.  Oh, I'm not going to eJailbait.  Why don't you consider one of those, Ant?  Why?  I'm not looking for some fucking online dating girl.  Let's just like, you know, Facebook.  Right.  Well, Lydia, you didn't really add much to this, but I don't blame you, because this story has kind of stopped a lot of people in their tracks. 
[01:33:00]  Really?  Yeah, it's a weird one to go with.  Yeah.  Because, you know, there is some concern there.  You've got to make sure she's okay.  Well, I'm very concerned.  I'm just talking about me being, you know, that's why I have the ding-ding on, because on my phone.  So I could just get updates.  I'm just surprised you did the right thing and took her to the hospital yourself, instead of getting someone else to do it.  Oh, I was kind of thinking maybe Keith could have, no. 
[01:33:30]  I have to say, I'm very impressed that Anthony did not leave her in the desert to die.  Oh, because that's the type of person I am.  What's the fucking Saudi Arabia joke?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you know, I might explain the joke to her.  That's actually a pretty good line from Lydia.  That's all I am.  That's actually good, you big-titted monster.  Yeah, you came up with a good one.  Okay, guys.  There goes Lydia.  Oh, God.  Terrible.  That's a funny line.  All right. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  I don't know.  All right.  We'll try to find the montage of this.  That video site from the 70s, all these guys.  Yeah.  Just saying ridiculously stupid things.  Yeah.  You found it?  You want to look at it?  Wow.  Great effects from the...  I'll fucking retweet this for everybody.  Okay, early to bed, early to rise makes a woman healthy, wealthy, and wise. 
[01:34:30]  It's Bobo.  That's why you're wiser than me.  It sounds like...  It's Steven.  Hi, I'm Maurice.  I'm an executive by day and a wild man by night.  Hi, my name's Monroe.

I'm not afraid to get sand on my tuxedo if you're not afraid to let the wind mess your  hair up a little bit when I take the top down.  Perhaps even a nice bath with some champagne and candles.  Hi, Mom.  Cool.  Molly.  I do fashion photography and I do consider myself a refined valley dude.  Okay.  I'm looking for a trendy girl with a simple smile. 
[01:35:30]  Smile?  Wait, it says here.  Oh, excuse me.  I don't know.  What I'm not looking for is some big overgrown monster that's always thinking about food.  Whoso binds to himself a joy, doth its winged life destroy.  I like to do a lot of sailing.  I like to do outdoor activities.  I like climbing.  I like travel.  I took a sponge ball.  I was pulling them out of a little girl's ear.  Vivacious.  Foxy. 
[01:36:00]  I'm looking for the goddess.  Are you the goddess?  Who is the goddess?  The goddess is the woman, is a woman, is any woman, is all women.  A figure that is sexy, slim, tight, excellent legs.  I'm a 25-year subscriber to both Playboy and a New Yorker magazine.  At night, I operate a damsel in distress hotline.  I guess you'd call me a knight.  And I win money.  Favorite foods is pizza. 
[01:36:30]  And just sugar and spice and all those things that are nice.  I like to be with people who are as fun and adventuresome as well.  Is into having fun.  Have fun.  I enjoy having fun, yes.  Looking for somebody who likes to have a lot of fun.  I'm looking for someone to have fun with.  I'd love to have a good time.  Able to have fun.  Fun and laughter.  And anything that's fun.  I like to have fun.  And have a lot of fun.  Are you looking for me? 
[01:37:00]  That is a zine.  No fatties.  I want it all.  No hamsters.  Bastille watches.  No dopers.  No smokers.  No alcoholics.  We don't like to write checks.  No Donna Juanitas.  We don't like to take out the garbage.  No posers.  What I'm doing right now is making a movie about World War II.  No crazies.  Santa Monica and my front porch swing.  I'm currently involved in cleaning up toxic waste.  I'm not having fun doing this.  Do you like cats?  Domestic violence.  I like to wear bright socks.  And I'm an avid Cleveland Browns fan. 
[01:37:30]  Sexual abuse.  Life is a playground and I want somebody to play with.  All sorts of alcoholics and addicts and stuff.  Because I really have a zany sense of humor.  We probably don't like to clean the house.  My mother still writes to me regularly.  Because I average about four hours a night's sleep.  I will cry at a commercial.  I'm interested in most phases of data processing.  Type A, I'm not.  Comfortable, caring, and serious about our relationship, I am. 
[01:38:00]  I'm really looking for somebody I can feel special about.  And I don't encounter people like that very often.  I'm hoping you're one of them.  He's in a Viking costume.  Are you that woman?  Please give me a call.  And you know that a journey always begins with the first step.  And I hope that if you like what I'm trying to say or you'd like to know more about me to please write.  How great is that? 
[01:38:30]  You gotta see the fucking...  All right.  The fucking guys.  That's a good one.  Gotta link that.  Dude, I'm gonna guess this is 81.  Or is it older than that?  I think it's the 70s.  Is it 70s?  No, no, no.  81 or 82?  I'm gonna go late 70s.  They didn't have video like that.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  That was kind of 80s-ish.  The mullet was there.  Yeah.  Which wasn't very big in the 70s.  Early 80s?  82.  82?  I guess, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Danny, could you email me a link to that?  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:39:00]  It's very funny.  Are there more than one montage or is that it?  Montage.  How great is that?  Yeah, you gotta see the video.  We'll retweet it for everybody.  Why don't we take a break?  We got Bill Burr here.  He's gonna join the program.  And then we got Bob Kelly and Dane Cook in about a half hour.  So a very, very busy show.  Yeah.  And I hope your girl's doing all right there, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And we'll play the Lindsay Lohan audio next.  This is a really good story today.  Stay there. 
[01:39:30]  Obi and Anthony in studio.  Bill Burr.  As part of the New York Comedy Festival.  That's right.  Playing town hall, what, tomorrow night, Bill?  Yes, I am.  Tickets at Ticketmaster.com.  There you go.  You beat me to the punch.  How come I can't hear myself?  You got your volume?  I can't hear myself.  There we go.  Well, I'm dealing with Yankees victory here today.  Oh, what a story.  What a story.  Amazing, right?  It's amazing.  It's fantastic.  It's a Cinderella story, isn't it?  Just a bunch of knock-around guys. 
[01:40:00]  A bunch of lugs.  Who would have thought?  Knocker.  Who would have thought?  You know, I thought the USA Today had the greatest call.  And Brian Cashman was just saying, you know, he was so happy for A-Rod.  Because he's been through a lot.  Yeah, he sure has.  I can't imagine trying to eke out a living, banging Madonna, and getting blown by Kate  Hudson, just on your 90 million square foot patio.  Making 100 million a year.  Having so much money you can actually control the weather in your state.  I mean, the poor guy.  I mean, he's been through so much.  And just to see. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, who would have thought at the beginning of the season, too, was CeCe Sabathia, A.J.  Burnett, Derek Jeter, A-Rod, Mark Teixeira, Hideki Matsui, Johnny Damon, Mariano Rivera.  Who would have ever thought at the beginning of the season that just this group of just  lovable lugs could somehow come together and just manage to just pull it off?  I mean, it's just it warms the heart.  It's what America is all about, that anybody truly has a chance in this world.  Sure, there's the Walmarts.  But if you have a if you have a dream in a hardware store, you can do it. 
[01:41:00]  It's going to see a small market team going all the way.  Hang in there, Pittsburgh.  Hang in there.  It is inspiring.  It's a good small market story.  It's truly one of the greatest championships, one of the greatest achievements I've ever  seen in my life to just, I mean, just seriously, just go build, go.  Yeah, just the heart and soul of that team is just, it's absolutely incredible.  They've all been through a lot, right?  They've just been through so much.  They've been through so much.  And it really has been such a long time.  I mean, eight long years that they had to suffer through winning divisions every year, 
[01:41:30]  a couple of pennants.  I mean, I don't know how these Yankee fans did it, but really, I mean, congratulations  for hanging in there.  You're truly a sports fan.  And Anthony, the first time in eight years I've seen you wear a Yankee hat.  It's fantastic to see.  That is true.  Just a true sports fan.  It's just a phenomenal, one of the truly great championships I've ever seen.  My hat's off to you.  Congratulations to all the Yankee fans.  Yeah, it says that he's been a Yankee fan for many years.  I've seen it.  Oh, he totally has.  But this is the first time I've ever seen him in a Yankee hat. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, no, no, no, they all have.  He's been for years.  There's really been nothing to cheer about for eight years.  So, you know.  I understand, yeah.  Just having two of the greatest shortstuffs ever, one deciding to play third base.  I'm expecting Ryan Howard to sign next year and agree to play second.  No, it's fantastic.  It's a great league.  It's run really well.  San Diego Padres have eight-year-olds playing in their outfield.  Because that's all they could get. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God.  No, it's going to be great.  And I can't wait for the Yankees-Red Sox again next year.  It's going to be as exciting as Friday the 13th, part nine.  Oh, my God.  There's a cycle in the...  Is he still in the lake?  I love a league where it's the same four teams every year.  It's absolutely fantastic.  The sport does have a problem.  It has a few problems.  I'm hoping the Red Sox re-sign Eric Gagne again.  That was a great one to do.  I think the Yankees and the Red Sox have, like, buzzards flying around, flying around, like, the Pirate Stadium. 
[01:43:00]  And any time anybody hits a triple, they just swoop down and they grab them and stick them on their bench.  To go with your rant, Sean in North Carolina, do you believe in miracles?  Because after that victory yesterday, I certainly do.  I had a tear in my eye.  I just couldn't believe it.  I mean...  So unexpected.  To see the bankers stealing all this money and to finally see the little guy just come through.  It was just absolutely fantastic.  It was the same feeling as the Olympics when the United States won the hockey game in the Olympics back there in 1980. 
[01:43:30]  That's just absolutely phenomenal.  Just like that.  I knew you'd have something to say.  Oh, it's just tremendous.  Let me be the first to fucking go bravo.  Fucking bravo on that.  I knew you had a couple in you, but...  That's like your Philly rant right there.  Oh, God.  That's up there, bro.  No.  I mean, no, dude, I'm a Red Sox fan.  We kind of followed him over the cliff there.  So, I mean, we kind of jumped the shark.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  The Eric Gagne signing was... 
[01:44:00]  I was just kind of like, all right, can we...  Is there any competition left?  It's just like, let's have four teams sign everybody in the league and then go beat the crap out of the Twins.  Four games to one, bitch.  You know, it's just...  Yeah.  I think that the Brewers have a girl with braces playing short stuff.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal lead.  Yeah, it was a good win. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, it was fantastic.  It's great for the city.  Well, shit about it.  Parade tomorrow.  11 a.m.  Big parade down the Canyon of Heroes.  Dude, I mean, I'm actually psyched that they won it last night because my show's tomorrow night.  And I was just like, there's nobody...  You can't compete with that shit.  There's a bunch of people who would have...  Oh, wait.  They would have played tonight, though, right?  Seventh game would have been tonight.  Oh, would have been tonight?  Yeah.  Hey, how come it went all the way into November?  That never happens, right?  It happened 9-11, obviously.  Yeah, because they kind of delayed some things.  Yeah, what the fuck did happen?  It usually ends in October, right?  Would they add more games? 
[01:45:00]  I know.  They don't play enough.  And I thought there was a lot of quick series.  I don't even remember it was Game 7, either.  How can it go into November when you look at the Colorado Rockies?  We were in Denver when they were playing.  It was 20 fucking 2 degrees.  What are they going to do in November if they get in the World Series?  Well, 20-degree weather?  The league's got it all figured out.  They make sure those teams aren't in it anymore.  Yeah, that's it.  You'll never see that, man.  They figure that out.  Pat from Wynaki, the Bad News Yankees.  Yes, Anthony.  Congratulations on your Bad News Yankees. 
[01:45:30]  Just like that fine movie.  The comparison is unbelievable, actually.  I mean, I don't know the genius of Brian Cashman to be able to sit there and put that team together.  To sit there and have to be like, we need a right fielder.  Who's the best guy available?  What's he being offered?  Give him $8 million more.  Next problem.  I mean, the guy truly knows what he's doing.  I could never do that job if I had a bottomless pit of money.  How do you do it?  It's just incredible. 
[01:46:00]  Holy shit.  Congratulations.  Fantastic.  Good for you, twin.  It was a big win.  They're saying they did it for Steinbrenner, but I think Anthony and Jimmy were talking  that no one saw Steinbrenner.  He's got to be in really bad shape that he wasn't even at that stadium.  He's not even making an appearance on video.  He has to be in bad shape, man.  That's awesome.  That's one of my big fears, man.  Seriously.  Obviously, I'm breaking the Yankees' balls here, but I don't wish bad health on anybody,  man.  I would never take it to that point. 
[01:46:30]  That's brutal.  With the Alzheimer's?  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  It's got to be Alzheimer's.  I ran into a Red Sox fan who made a joke about that, and I was just like, dude, really?  You're going to take it to that level?  Good Lord.  What's the karma?  It is a game.  Yeah.  Why don't you go deflate the wheels on somebody's wheelchair?  I should have said tires.  It would have been funny.  That's right.  Sometimes it's the same word twice.  The wheels with the wheels.  The same word twice.  Always funny.  And then you run to the end of it, hoping you have a tag or something. 
[01:47:00]  You're hoping there's some other description for a little rascal without the word wheel in  it.  The wheels.  The wheels.  It's the worst.  A lot of funnier in comedy than using the same word twice.  I got a turn.  You were taking turns.  Same word twice.  Sorry, folks.  That really is the worst.  Mike in Florida wants to add to Bill Burr's rant there.  Mike?  Hey, let me tell you something.  Any time that a team can go out and spend $1.6 billion since the last time they won a  World Series, it just really makes you feel good about the sport. 
[01:47:30]  Like Bill said, it's a heartwarming story.  It is.  It's unbelievable.  Do you think the Pirates have spent $1.6 billion in the last eight, nine years?  They actually have the worst owners in the league.  They're actually one of the most profitable teams, though.  Well, because, yeah, they don't spend any money on the actual players.  Yeah, they dump all their guys.  But on the other side, it's just like, look, you've got to spend at least...  I mean, the Red Sox this year only spent $1.25, but that's only because they got rid of Manny.  Manny's contract.  But, I mean, realistically, you've got to be spending like $1.60.  What's $1.60? 
[01:48:00]  $160 million.  $1.60 million, okay.  To $200 million to even to get...  I mean, every once in a while, you'll have like the Devil Rays will get in.  I mean, that's like truly great scouting.  But when all those guys are up for free agency...  Then you lose them.  Yeah, the Sox and the Yankees are going to take them.  You can't keep them.  I don't know.  I'm sure they're going to get Lee, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Cliff Lee is absolutely...  He had the audacity to win a couple of games.  That's it.  Yeah, that son of a bitch.  You've got to join the mafia now.  That's it.  Hey, listen.  You're one of us.  You just tap him on the shoulder.  But I like Philly. 
[01:48:30]  I can drive up to New York.  It's not that long a drive.  No, you don't understand.  Nah, you're ours.  You're with us.  If we want you just to sit on the bench so no one else can have you, that's the way it's going down.  Put on this shirt.  How do they figure it out?  A little salary cap action in baseball?  I would say whatever...  It's kind of working for other...  Whatever football is doing.  Because I think football is the best run league where...  You've got pretty much the same core players year after year, which is nice to see.  Yeah, I mean... 
[01:49:00]  Although they're trading more and more in football.  But when we were growing up, man, I mean, your team was your team for 10 straight years.  They barely traded anyone.  Yeah, I think with football, I don't know how...  I mean, I'm too stupid.  I'm not one of those fucking guys who sits there talking about who's the GM or whatever team.  But I do know the Jets were buried last year.  And even though they are, they've kind of tapered off here and it's just 4-4.  But now all of a sudden, they're competitive.  And the AFC East is a really good division now.  So I don't know what they're doing.  The Jets have money, though. 
[01:49:30]  The Jets are a big market team.  Every game is sold out.  They won't spring for a stadium.  They're a horrendous organization.  Terrible.  You know, Youngstown fans, I would actually feel good for, even though I hate the Jets,  is that Jets fans...  Were they the ones who have that YouTube link of them going down to the draft?  And every year they have, like, the number one draft.  Was that the Eagles or was that the Jets?  They were just playing the number one selection, the Jets pick.  Oh, really?  Eddie McGinowitz. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, how bad are you?  Like, your fans, the guys getting drunk in the parking lot, know better than you who  to pick.  I can't remember who has that video, but, like...  I gotta check that out now.  But it seems every year, that team, you want to talk about fans who just get lifted up  and then slammed down to the ground.  Was it basketball or NFL?  It was NFL.  They actually showed it on ESPN.  It was so funny.  But, yeah, like, they come out 3-0.  Look at them.  There we go.  Come on. 
[01:50:30]  It's so sad to see Damon without the beard and the hair.  And, Damon, he gotta get himself respectable to put the pinstripes on.  Actually, you know what?  I was working out in the Midwest, and I was near a religious sect, and they were claiming  that Jesus is coming back next year, and the Yankees are gonna sign him to play right  field.  They're still working out the whole beard issue.  See if they're gonna enforce that.  They're gonna sew Ted Williams' upside-down frozen head to his shoulder to give him advice  when he goes up.  You mean Ted Williams' dented head after they were batting around that room? 
[01:51:00]  He dropped his head.  He was sitting on a tuna can upside-down.  You know what?  You deserve it.  You'd fucking deserve it if you're that stupid.  There's no cure for not having a body.  I could see if they froze the whole fucking thing.  What, are you just gonna bring his head back to life?  Start wheeling him around?  In a wheelchair with a wheel?  Holy shit.  We should get a bunch of people together and go get Ted Williams' head. 
[01:51:30]  Just break into that fucking place and say, look, we're taking a fucking head.  They should sell pieces of it, just like they did with the Yankee stadium.  Just smash it on the ground.  Dude, I got his ear.  I guess what they're thinking is maybe in tens of thousands of years,  mankind will be so advanced that they could take what was the essence of Ted Williams  in that brain in his head and actually transplant it into either some type of cyborg 
[01:52:00]  or some kind of other thing.  I'm talking about that website, that Ted.com where I came in with the dog robot, that thing.  You should see what they're able to do with that whole stem cell research stuff.  They're beginning to be able to grow different parts of your body.  Grow organs.  Somebody had throat cancer.  They grew an esophagus in a Petri dish and just put it in.  You'll literally be able to do a body-off restoration, just like a car.  The only thing I haven't seen is anything about bones.  I remember watching it just going, if you had the money, you could truly live forever 
[01:52:30]  if they can actually start growing this stuff.  Yeah.  Jesus, my stupidity.  No, you're right, though.  Look at George.  Again, look, George Steinbrenner, rich.  What's it doing for him?  Well.  Oh, yeah.  Then you could actually tease him in his situation because he could get out of it.  Because then he'd be able to just, yeah, clone whatever's fucked up in him.  What is that?  That plaque you get on your brain or something like that?  Oh, God.  They did a study.  They did a study on cell phones, and they did not do it in this country, 
[01:53:00]  about it causing brain cancers and tumors.  Yeah.  And they were literally talking about it.  I used to have that bit where I was saying, like, you know,  you feel it cook on the side of your head.  You never get off.  You just switch it to the other ear and sear your brain like a tuna steak.  And they were literally saying that you might want to switch it over.  Don't always talk in the same.  Get the hands-free device.  I think I'm done.  I'm trying to phase my cell phone out.  Yeah, but, dude, we talk about this all the time.  No one uses their phones to make calls and text.  I rarely make a phone call on my phone.  Yeah, but you have it on, and it's right next to your balls.  That's true.  You're going to get, like, fucking thumb tumors from texting or some shit. 
[01:53:30]  But, yeah, I just text.  I text all the time.  It's weird when my phone rings at this point.  When they show video from right now with us standing there with the phones up to us,  it's going to be like us watching those Army guys walking towards that atom bomb that they set off.  The atom bomb blast.  That's what they do.  All right, let's see what it does to this generation.  The poster of the doctors recommending Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Nine out of ten doctors say the smooth pull is mild on the throat.  Hey, here's the great taste to it.  You want to try this, Dan? 
[01:54:00]  Danny found the New York Jets draft blunders, it's called, on YouTube.  Oh, yeah, this is great.  I think it's a good selection, but a very surprising one.  UCLA running back Freeman McNeil.  As a season ticket holder of the Jets, I'm going to boo.  Jets take the first round selection quarterback.  Ken O'Brien of California Davis.  Dan Marino is available. 
[01:54:30]  Marino was going to be around at that time.  They take Marino.  Obviously, the Jets know something that people are going to go.  Wait a minute, stop.  Hold on.  I had no idea we could have got Marino.  No fucking idea.  No, 1983 is one of the greatest drafts of all time.  Well, there was a lot of quarterbacks in the draft.  It was called the quarterback draft.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all that.  And John Elway went first.  Right.  And then, like, the next people to take a quarterback were the Kansas City Chief.  They took, like, Todd Blackledge.  The Patriots took Tony Eason.  The Jets took Ken O'Brien. 
[01:55:00]  And then with, like, the 27th pick, the Miami Dolphins.  27th.  So, obviously, I think they went to the Super Bowl and lost to the Redskins, like, the year before.  And they got Marino.  They got Dan Marino.  I had no idea.  Wow.  Who else was in that draft?  Wasn't Kelly in there or Boomer Esiason?  The Bills were the only ones who did themselves a service.  Because as much as he didn't win, at least they did go to four Super Bowls.  Holy.  Back that up, little Danny, please.  You just hear fucking the Jets.  What?  So, Elway went to Denver first. 
[01:55:30]  They took him first?  Actually, the Colts drafted, the Baltimore Colts drafted John Elway.  And they were so bad, he refused to play and was going to play with the Yankees.  Oh, shit.  This is so funny.  I can't remember anything from math, but I remember all of this crap.  I remember that.  And then he said he wasn't going to play, so they traded his rights to the Broncos.  Oh, he would have left them and played baseball.  Yeah, like, that's how bad the Colts were.  It's just like, I'm not, I'm changing sports.  All right, let's go back to that.  I'm out of here. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Everybody said if Marino was going to be around at that time, they'd take Marino.  Obviously, the Jets know something that, you know, the people up here don't.  Oh, really?  Jets, first round selection.  Fullback.  Roger Vick.  Texas A&M.  That's Roger.  New York Jets, first round choice.  Oh, my God.  Jeff Lagerman.  I love everyone going, no. 
[01:56:30]  They're laughing.  It's obvious to me right now that the Jets just don't understand what the draft's all about.  The New York Jets select Blair Thomas.  The New York Jets select Johnny Mitchell.  Tight end Nebraska.  Oh, come on.  So New York becomes tight end, tight end.  We want it.  We want it.  Warren Sapp.  They can have Warren Sapp.  New York Jets select tight end from Penn State, Kyle Brady. 
[01:57:00]  The fans are literally telling them who to draft, and they blow it.  Warren Sapp they could have had.  That's classic.  That's hysterical fucking funny.  How terrible.  It wasn't really a fine.  They showed it on ESPN a long time.  We didn't know about it.  New York Jets 2009 NFL draft.  Oh, no.  Whatever.  What was the New York Jets draft blunders on YouTube?  Thanks, Dan.  Did you see that one guy, that fantasy football before fantasy football guy, just sitting there with his hands like, what are you doing? 
[01:57:30]  He's like, what?  No.  Well, first of all, do you realize how hardcore a fan you have to be to show up for the draft?  Show up for the draft.  Yeah.  This is like before people were really into it.  You know what I mean?  And these guys are actually coming down.  They've got jerseys on.  It's easy to look.  And they know the players better than the fucking players.  Yeah, apparently.  But it's easy to look back and go, holy shit.  At the time, no one really knew who Dan Marino was as far as on an NFL level.  You know what I mean?  I mean.  Yeah, but who the fuck are they picking?  That's just great.  Can I tell you something, though?  One part about, I'll say this for the Yankees, even though you are, you're right what you said. 
[01:58:00]  I can't even argue with it.  They have let some players go, some young players that I was very doubtful about.  And fucking, and really, it was like what great scouting they have.  Because fucking Ricky Lede, who was supposed to be like a superstar, went nowhere.  Who did A-Rod replace?  The fucking guy, the big, Alfonso Soriano, was supposed to be this fucking superstar.  He didn't do a whole lot of stuff.  Because they've let some players go, which actually I hated.  I actually thought when they had Alfonso Soriano, I thought that they were a more balanced infield than when they had A-Rod. 
[01:58:30]  I liked him, too.  I didn't want him to go.  Just because he was looking up to Jeter and there wasn't that weirdness.  Something on Marino.  It's coming in a lot.  Let's go to Jamie in Ohio.  Jamie, go ahead.  Hey, Opie.  I was calling to let you guys know the reason Marino dropped so far, there are rumors that Don Shula has never denied,  was that he was telling everybody that Dan Marino had a coke problem when he was in college.  He didn't want to say that.  Wow. 
[01:59:00]  He didn't want to say that?  That's been out there.  Wait, was Shula saying that just so no one would take him?  He was saying that's nobody to take him.  He knew he didn't have the problem, but Don Shula knew he wouldn't get him.  So he told all the managers that Dan Marino had a coke problem.  What an asshole.  And then he's like, hey, Dan Marino.  Wait, did Shula start the rumor?  Apparently.  No.  This is all rumors.  I've worked the improv in Pittsburgh.  I'm going to leave it at that. 
[01:59:30]  There's a lot of stories out there.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of stories out there.  See, am I a dick right now for saying that?  Because I wasn't going to bring that up.  No, fine.  Somebody else brought it up.  Yeah.  That was an old rumor.  And another thing, Warren Sapp, I remember that year, in defense of the Jets, he had something  going on.  Did he come from the University of Miami?  I forget.  If you just go to the University of Miami, people are looking at you like, all right,  this guy's got an Uzi.  Yeah.  You know?  I don't know.  I don't know the history of Warren Sapp, but fuck, we're going to add Warren Sapp. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Holy cow.  And they're chanting his name.  The video's great.  We want Sapp.  We want Sapp.  Sapp, yeah.  The Jet fans are just throwing their arms up.  Oh, my favorite one.  Oh, no.  What was that guy, Lugugugowski or whatever that was?  Yeah, yeah.  It was just like the great guy.  The names are hilarious.  It's a name that you don't remember.  No one heard of the guy.  It just sounds like a guy who isn't going to do anything.  But he could have been a Hall of Famer.  Who knows?  That's the time.  Well, that's the thing.  If you watch a lot of college football, there's guys who just like, just like Reggie Bush. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, he's doing fine.  But the way he played in college, you would have thought that that guy, he looked like  O.J. Simpson.  Saying that because he's a Trojan.  What about Tebow?  What do you think is going to happen to him?  Do you think he's going to be good in the NFL?  I don't know.  That's what people say.  They don't know.  Because he runs so much.  And I think...  Which is just so dangerous in the NFL.  Yeah, you can't.  You can't.  Because everybody can match that speed and then you go, all right.  Yeah.  And then just, they break your ankle.  Yeah.  They're so good.  They know how to do that at that level.  They just sort of roll off you.  Oh, sorry.  Did I catch your foot? 
[02:01:00]  Did I catch you?  You know who I saw do that?  Bill Romanowski.  I saw him do that to Shannon Sharp.  And they did it right on Monday Night Football.  Well, Shannon Sharp's arm was underneath him and he just hooked it and he dislocated his elbow.  Oh, rolled over it.  He hooked it and rolled and just, after the play was over.  And I was...  And gets away with it because, you know...  Totally got away.  Yeah, it was just, you know, thank God I didn't hurt myself.  That's what you get for sticking it out at this level.  Have your hands in, just like on a carnival ride. 
[02:01:30]  The other side of this draft thing, Kevin from Connecticut, let's not forget, yeah,  Tom Brady was drafted like 250, he says 256.  Was he really?  Really?  Absolutely.  Wow.  So you never know.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  No one picked Brady.  What round was that, 256?  He was like a, maybe like a fourth round pick?  Fourth or fifth round, easy, right?  Something like that.  Jesus.  Well, he says 28 picks a round.  20, okay.  30, 32 picks a round, each team gets to pick once, right?  Yeah, so that's a seven or eighth round, possibly.  I might be wrong on how many picks there are because I don't think he went that deep. 
[02:02:00]  But I will tell you this, though, but people did know Warren Sapp was a beast,  but he had like, he kind of had like that...  Six rounds.  Six rounds, 199th pick.  Six rounds.  Fucking Brady.  Well, how many rounds are there?  82.  No, I think there's, what is there, there's like 10 or 11, and by then, yeah, it's like,  and from, from whatever, Arapahoe Community College, the San Diego Chargers pick.  You think that guy's excited?  Bill Poulsen.  Is Bill Poulsen excited?  He's all excited to grab that jersey. 
[02:02:30]  Marv Tettelbaum.  Boom.  Ted Sheckler.  And then they grab the jersey back and go, not so fast.  They got like those names from the 1800s.  You know, Ebenezer.  Ebenezer.  Yes.  Fucking world.  Yeah, Civil War names.  Ebenezer Rothschild goes up.  I saw Jimmy is putting on his jacket.  If you're leaving, I got to play something for you before you leave, my friend.  I'm going a couple minutes. 
[02:03:00]  A couple minutes.  Okay.  Jimmy intro'd Ozzy in L.A.  Yeah.  So, dude, you're living the dream.  Yeah, it was embarrassing.  But the intro was...  A little embarrassing.  A little over the top.  And the thing has taken on a life of its own.  We played it in front of Sharon Osbourne like yesterday or two days ago.  Oh, did you get a little excited, Jim?  Look at Bill's like a little excited, Jim.  And now the boys have put together a production piece.  I wouldn't know.  Here, listen to this before you leave.  I don't want to. 
[02:03:30]  Jim Norton introing Ozzy Osbourne.  Oh, you motherfuckers.  You're sitting at Barry Manilow concert.  Oh, you're right here.  You're right here, you're right here, boys.  Look at him, look at me.  And here's what multi, multi, multi-millionaire Simon Cowell thinks of Jim Norton introing Ozzy Osbourne.  Simon Cowell calls me the next day, and he lives in Beverly Hills, and he goes, 
[02:04:00]  I was sat in my garden, and suddenly I hear this motherfucker introducing Ozzy Fockett Osbourne.  I'm like, I'm sorry, Simon.  Oh, I'm so happy.  That makes it worth it.  You know what, he's a Barry Manilow fan.  Jesus, I ruined the night of a mogul.  That was embarrassing.  Let's hear it again.  I got to commend you for having the nerve to sit here and listen. 
[02:04:30]  I can't even listen to myself when I'm doing well.  I can't even listen to myself.  I'm telling you, nobody takes a pound and like, he's a good sport.  We just, I'm sure a lot of people were thankful, though, that they might have thought they were at a Barry Manilow concert.  He simply was for clarity.  Oh my God, I got to get out of here.  It's Ozzy Osbourne?  Fuck.  I'm just, I'm really happy that that annoyed Simon, though, when he called Sharon.  You should hear him complain.  And Barry Manilow really is a relevant reference.  I think, you know, he's just-  Believe me, I couldn't have picked. 
[02:05:00]  I've seen that!  Michael Bumble would have been better.  Michael Bumble would have been better.  Come on, people, this isn't Tiny Tim.  This isn't a Kenny G concert.  This is fucking-  But hey, you know, please, have me introduce ACDC.  I bet I could top it.  I'd be so geeked out.  We got Dane Cook outside the studio.  This isn't Gary Glitter.  With Bob Kelly.  Yeah, good thing to hear.  Have him walk in.  Dane, what's up, brother? 
[02:05:30]  What's up, guys?  Here we go.  We got a full house today.  What's up, dude?  What's up?  How are we?  We're just-  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  You motherfucker!  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you.  I like how people-  We always say that.  How people congratulate people.  It's like, hey, congratulations.  No, I'm happy for you guys.  That's what all Yankee fans said when we finally won.  And all of a sudden, they were nice guys.  Yeah.  After years of just knocking your dick in the dirt, they were just like,  No, no, I'm happy for you guys.  No, no, I'm happy for you.  It's good for you guys, you know, I've always respected you guys.  Listen, I'm going to get out of here before the pounding starts. 
[02:06:00]  I was saying earlier how none of the Yankees on the field, after they won,  said word one about the Phillies and how they played.  Like, there wasn't a, hey, they were a tough team.  They didn't say shit about it.  But I'm happy about that.  It was all about Matt Sui and this.  They didn't, no, usually, you know, I hate sportsmanship.  Before I sing, we've got to take our hats off to the Phillies.  They did a great job, you know, not a word.  I hate, because it's fake.  I don't like sportsmanship.  It's great.  It's all forced.  It's forced.  Fuck them. 
[02:06:30]  You know they want to punch each other in the face.  It's like comedians after a great set, man.  A great set.  Good set.  I used to have a bit like that 19 years ago, that everything is something that the  other comic did at one point.  But you did it better.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Great job.  I had the idea, but you really took it to a new level.  Good luck with it.  No one's happy for others.  After I come off stage at the cellar, Artie Fuqua is the host all the time, and he'll  give me a hug as we're coming off.  He'll go, good set, baby.  And I'm like, I'm not a fucking, you're not a member of the audience.  You don't have to say that to me.  Maybe he thinks you're a baby. 
[02:07:00]  But it's like, who cares?  But you've got to respect that guy.  I saw him throw a right hook and knock a guy out.  Yeah, I'm not saying Artie's not a fucking...  He's a problem.  A tortured, substance abuse fucking psychopath.  That's a good punch.  I didn't give it to him.  It was your New Year's Eve show where he picked up a chair like a lion tamer and was fighting  like five fucking animals.  Five steroid guys from the Philly area.  And knocked one of them right out cold.  Oh, look who's got to take the fucking couch.  Oh, Bobby.  What?  What's wrong with the...  Bobby's got to take the couch.  First time he's ever been asked to sit on the couch. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, what do you mean?  You think they put the best shot over there?  That was just hurtful and mean.  I'm kidding, Bobby.  Settle down.  I was just talking to him about the Propecia and the Rogaine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think I want hair again.  I think I might go the way of the Anthony.  You've got to go with the follicle.  I'm getting a great mullet growing back there.  I've got a video.  I've got to get rid of it.  I should have bought it.  Can I have some of your mullet?  Yeah, I'll get it from the donor area.  What's your video? 
[02:08:00]  I took the Propecia and I started cumming yellow chunks.  What?  For real?  Honest to God.  You're supposed to put it on your head.  You're supposed to get cocked in Propecia.  You're supposed to get really hairy balls.  What the fuck are you doing?  You know what?  Dude, you're bald.  You put the hair back on.  Boom.  You've got hair again.  A couple of coffee.  Cigarette.  Yeah.  You're supposed to wear a hat.  Dane said he's got a video.  What's the video?  Yeah, somebody said, Jay Hall's brother from Chicago had our first, it was 92, and it's 
[02:08:30]  all of us doing our stand-up and then sketches.  It's the whole show.  Wow.  Yeah, we did improv, which is one letter short of improved.  No, no, no.  Right here.  Here's our improv.  Here's our improv.  We're so savvy.  We're on stage and we're like, all right, we need a fake movie.  And you know, improv is like, the first thing somebody yells out, we're sifting through  all the options.  Guy's like, ghost house, and we're looking at each other.  Nah, what else?  Just keep yelling.  Pick a better one. 
[02:09:00]  Pick a better one.  You yell something we've done before.  It's fucking improv.  You're supposed to just go with the first one.  No.  Nah.  Improv, I just hate it.  I hate watching it.  My girl's taking an improv class and she actually gave me the book on how to do improv and everything.  And the amount of swipes they take at stand-up comedians.  Oh, you shitting me really?  I was reading it on the plane.  I just kept going like, yeah, they're just like, you know, this isn't like a stand-up comedian  where it's all been rehearsed time and time again. 
[02:09:30]  Sure, there might be a little bit of improv.  It's just like, I'd say, if I wrote a book about stand-up, at no point would I feel the  need to take a swipe at people who do improv.  Because they're fucking jealous that they, I'm telling you, improv people are fucking jealous  that they can't just stand there with a microphone.  They need eight other people.  And when they run out of fucking steam, they yell, tag, and the next asshole comes and  bails them out.  We don't have that option.  You think I don't want to yell, tag, sometimes?  I'm fucking eating my balls?  Please come up and help me.  Now, wasn't that improv right there? 
[02:10:00]  Did you have a lot written to work out?  I said that actually yesterday morning, the exact same time.  Every morning, same thing.  I tried it on 800 different radio stations before I came.  That's what I was thinking.  I was thinking, Yopi and Anthony should do improv every day.  Oh my God.  We don't know what the fuck we're going to say next.  We're reading a teleprompter right now.  Right, yeah.  The whole rule of improv, too.  Like, number one golden rule.  Don't deny.  Don't deny.  And our whole thing was deny.  Yeah.  We would just mess with each other.  You know, you'd be like, oh, you know, obviously holding like a fake baby rocket. 
[02:10:30]  Why are you carrying your own tire from your car?  It would just destroy each other.  It's like comedy cock block.  You guys aren't all the biggest assholes out there.  Comics are just assholes.  Sometimes the problems will be false.  False.  It's been a rape up thing. 
[02:11:00]  I love it.  You guys watch the World Series?  Anything on it?  Yeah.  Bobby, how can you follow Burr's rant?  Yeah, I know.  That was one of the fucking best things I've ever heard.  That was tremendous.  And you know what I love about this girl here?  She wore the Yankee shirt.  Linda Church.  Yeah, when they lose, she still wears that jersey.  She still does the weather just to show what a big fan she is.  She didn't just break it out because they finally won.  That's the kind of true fan they got.  Anthony, you've been wearing that Yankee hat for at least eight minutes.  I mean, you guys, just truly, just a heartwarming.  The high-priced dialogue.  Just to watch this city come together.  Let me, I'll be completely honest with you. 
[02:11:30]  I, I've had...  Did you have relatives who were 28 the last time you won?  It's unbelievable.  And now they're 36.  I mean, can they even remember the last one?  I don't know what a gun.  I don't know what a fucking gun.  He got you pretty good today.  Oh, it's just as bad.  We spend a buck 80 every year.  Who gets a shit?  You're right up there with the spending.  Exactly.  It's just fucking annoying to hear every Puerto Rican driving by my house playing Jay-Z and Alicia Keys song.  Oh, enough of that.  Empire State of Mind.  Oh, God.  I'm not sick of it yet. 
[02:12:00]  I'm not sick of it yet.  I haven't heard the Jay-Z version.  I really, actually, I listen to it too much.  I hope they play it on the flight on the way back to L.A.  I'm pretty fucking sick of it.  You know what the worst one is?  That one that they do on American Airlines where they just try to dumb you down so you don't realize you're getting fucked over.  I can't even do it.  My voice is fucked up.  But they'll just be like, you know, they play this little sort of piano.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  And then this guy goes, ee, ee, ee, ee.  I can't even do this really high-pitched fucking thing. 
[02:12:30]  And it's like, they're literally subconsciously calling me a fucking moron.  Sitting by a jet engine in the fucking bathroom.  Three in a bus with my knees in my chest.  It'll be $97 for the yogurt plate.  This is better than fucking William Frawley on Continental that comes out and fucking tells you he runs the airline.  Oh, that fucking nervous Nelly, that awful, uh, oh, what's his name?  What's his name?  We have the youngest fleet.  I'm going to see O'Connell Airlines.  Larry Kellner. 
[02:13:00]  He sucks.  Larry Kellner.  His nervous hands, they flap out and go back to his stupid lap.  Larry Kellner.  He's got a big fucking overbite like a puppet.  I fucking despise him.  He's got that nervous performance tick.  Yeah.  I'm talking behind a desk.  I'm Larry Kellner.  My overbite is so big, it affects the way I do it.  They used to say we have the youngest fleet,  and now because of JetBlue, like, we have one of the youngest fleets in the industry.  One of it, oh boy.  And they used to say we serve meals at mealtime, and they don't say that anymore.  No.  Fuck cotton, I don't know more blankets than first class.  Shit. 
[02:13:30]  First class, no pillow.  No more pillow.  No more.  I was, yeah.  You've got to bring your own.  We have a way to go.  I'm really happy that my friends are doing well,  because I'm leaving soon to go do the improv in Houston,  but I'm really happy that Bill Burr is doing Town Hall and Dane is doing the Garden.  I mean, it's really nice to see your friends  hope your fucking fires break out in both of your fucking shows.  You've got to fly to Texas to do a fucking comedy club.  Oh, wait.  You guys just zip into town and do big theaters.  God fucking dead. 
[02:14:00]  Dude, that was another line from that fucking improv book.  Yes.  There are comedy clubs called the improv,  but there's very little improv that goes on in the side of the audience.  I don't think if we go in there and work your magic.  Sorry, nobody wants to watch fucking Five Idiots yell,  give me a watch, give me a subject.  Think of your own shit, cunt.  At that club out in L.A., I won't say which one,  because I'm not going to trash your group,  but every Sunday they would come down and they would do improv,  and after you watched it four weeks in a row,  they had bits.  They had stuff that they went to. 
[02:14:30]  Right, right.  Go-to stuff.  Yeah, they have their go-to improv.  You know who's a great improver?  Amy Poehler.  I watched at UCB one night.  She's fucking, it annoyed me how good she was.  I'm like, if you're going to improv, that's how you should do it.  Yeah, it probably wasn't.  I stink, though.  I go right for the dick.  Like, I'm three lines out.  I'm like, go ahead, you'll have sex.  I'm terrible.  Fucking hard work.  Bob, do you want to come up and sit here?  Because I've got to leave, man.  Jimmy's leaving us.  Bobby!  Are you going to the improv now?  He's got to fly.  Fly, Eric.  Not shows up in 20 minutes. 
[02:15:00]  I'm out in 15 minutes.  What the fuck's going on?  Abandoning ship.  He's got to go.  He's got to go down to the Yankee store.  I've got to go down to the Yankee store.  Well, why don't you explain to Dane.  I've got to get a 27 championship.  Why don't you explain to Dane, Coke, Bob, Kelly, and Bill Burr?  Because they didn't hear.  I didn't know Bill Burr heard.  Oh, my God.  What a hilarious.  We heard.  Well, once you tell Dane.  Oh, come on, dude.  I'm sorry.  What, did he fart right there?  He rubbed my mouth.  Can you wait until I'm out of the seats?  Fucking Jesus Christ.  Look at this.  It's like you're breaking up with your girl and the guy's fucking her while you're packing your suitcase. 
[02:15:30]  Really?  Bobby's like already in Jimmy's seat.  Where are you going?  He's got to go to a hospital.  I've got to go and check on somebody.  A friend.  Get their side of the story.  And, you know, perhaps pick them up and, you know.  He's leaving out a few details.  Are they in the hospital?  Yeah.  She has like asthma.  Oh, it's a female.  Do they have cartoons on the wall?  Well, that's what we're getting at.  It was, uh...  She's in a certain part of the hospital.  Well, I didn't know that they admit, uh, uh, girls, uh, of that age into the pediatric ward. 
[02:16:00]  You're so mad.  I had to actually sit in the pediatric emergency room.  And you had to actually say to the nurse, how do you spell colic?  Yeah, I had to sit in the, uh, pediatric, uh, emergency room as the doctor went over everything.  And I, I, let me tell you something.  I've had some, Anthony, you are a fucking creep moments in my life.  But that topped everything that I've ever done in my life, uh, as far as being the creepy guy. 
[02:16:30]  I just felt like a fucking ghoul sitting there with people looking like, okay, 18.  Just turned.  Did you ever cross your mind to leave and say, I can't do this anymore?  Like an alcoholic hitting bottom?  You can't have the chick, like, fucking, you know, wheezing.  Did you call anybody for help and say, what's going on with me?  No, it's like, no.  What am I doing?  Why?  Why?  It's consenting adults.  I don't know why they check them into pediatrics. 
[02:17:00]  For the love of Christ, why the fuck?  You know what, I can't make up my mind.  I can't make up my mind on this one.  If, if, if that side, what Bobby's arguing is right, or if that's just, just jealousy and hate that people also, like, other people didn't just, you know, just stay single.  You know, continue to focus on the career so you're successful enough that you can bang an 18-year-old.  What are you, 62?  I'm working my way through my 40s. 
[02:17:30]  Dude, and what a way to go through your 40s.  Through somebody else's 15s.  Asshole.  Never underage.  You like that one, Bobby?  I know all the state statutes.  Believe me, I got it on a fucking, there's an app for that.  I don't, I really.  Look up Missouri.  Can you get me a ride home to New Jersey?  I'm sorry, baby, that's going to be a problem.  Let me go check my phone.  I can't.  I can't.  Go around this state.  I can go up New York and then go over to Pennsylvania.  I have to go around the state. 
[02:18:00]  I'm the only one in, like, 80 years to be arrested for the Mann Act.  I don't even know what it is.  You transport her across state lands, boy?  In her bare feet.  Yeah, it's statutory rape.  Oh, shit.  It was, yeah, it was.  That's a good one.  Embarrassing.  That's one of the better stories Anthony has told.  I like how Bobby's eating here and he just tried to contribute to the show by eating and  just goes, ah, shit.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  What'd I say?  Dude, you got your eggs, your coffee, you need the energy for the show.  Boom, bang, I'm in. 
[02:18:30]  Jimmy's out.  It's all protein, dude.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I just found a fucking, this just sucks.  I ordered an egg white armor with ham and there was a carrot in the middle of it.  Why egg whites with ham?  Fuck, why is there orange?  Like, why bother with the ham?  If you're going to have the ham, you might as well just go all in with the eggs.  Go with the yolk.  The yolk is the best tasting part.  No, I like egg white.  And douse it in salt and pepper.  The only time I like the yolk is when it's gooey.  Yeah, you could have it like loose.  When you bite it in a sandwich, it just shoots out and then you wipe it up with a fucking 
[02:19:00]  some toast.  Yeah.  Good shit right there, man.  Don't get me going on fat stories.  Don't get me going.  I actually was in Miami Improv.  I went to El Polo Tropicana and ordered $40 worth of meat.  The next year I went back, they remembered me.  You were like, oh, you last time here was one of the most meats ever.  Remember we had like that session at Fogo?  A session?  We sat there so long that the knives were dull by the time the chef came.  How about the other night? 
[02:19:30]  We were working out for like two weeks straight eating egg whites and chicken breast.  Oh, yeah.  And then I brought up McDonald's for some reason.  Oh, no.  How I hate getting fries.  One fry, large fry.  Because it ends.  You know, you get to the end.  Yeah.  And you're like, ah, that's that one mushy fry at the end that you try to...  Should I dip it in ketchup?  Should I eat it raw?  How should I enjoy...  You eat a large fry and you're upset that it ends?  Dude, fat people make food so fucking gross.  He goes...  They just make it gross. 
[02:20:00]  So he tells me, he goes, well, do what I used to do.  I used to get three large fries and put them in a bag.  That way, I'm not going to eat them all, but they never end.  Oh, holy shit, it's never ending.  That's such a great way to go about it.  Oh, that's fantastic.  We're talking about it.  Then we decide we're going to do it one day.  You just eat it until you sleep.  We decide we're going to do it one day, and then it turns into either tomorrow night or  the next night, and then we're driving by McDonald's after the gig, and we're like,  dude, there's a McDonald's, and we're going back and forth.  All of a sudden, this stupid limo driver just turns in.  Turned in.  He made the decision for you. 
[02:20:30]  We weren't going to say yes, so the whole time we're like, yeah, dude, there it is.  There it is.  And this guy just gets in the drive-thru.  We just froze and stared at each other.  He did that thing where he pulled up so the mic was next to the back window, so we had  the entire option to be like, no, we're good.  Two double quarter pounders with cheese, a shake, ten chicken McNuggets, three fries each.  Each.  Each.  Yeah, they had to drop new fries for us. 
[02:21:00]  Then we got on the plane.  We had Tyson documentary, and then we ate all the food.  I thought it was fucking hallucinating, because we saw the northern lights were coming from  Alaska.  So I look out the window, and it's just green and purple.  I'm like, I'm dying.  I cut diabetes.  He's got like so full of trans fats, he can't recognize colors anymore.  That's fucked up.  You know what's funny, though, is you sit there and you say you're not going to eat,  you're not going to eat, but the second you get a whiff of that grease, it's over. 
[02:21:30]  It's fucking over, it really is.  It's one of the great smells that's on this planet.  You guys like the Tyson documentary?  How great was that?  I see Tyson have a fucking brain.  Yeah, man.  He's really, he's like Mensa smart, man.  That guy was...  Absolutely.  No one knew that.  So intelligent.  Anyone watched Anvil?  Have you seen that documentary?  I love Anvil.  I had Anvil in here.  Yeah.  It's good to know that they're doing okay.  Yeah, but now I heard they're going to do the soundtrack for like Iron Man 2.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  Now they're as big as you can get.  That's incredible.  I wanted to see that one.  Because they didn't make it.  Like, it's a fucking paradox.  They made it because they hadn't made it for so long.  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for.  And that's the only way they made it.  I'm hoping to make a documentary next year.  Have you seen it in?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  Bill, you've seen it?  No, I didn't see it.  I got it.  You feel so bad for the one guy because he's just believing in this.  The dream that he should have gave up on 20 years ago.  He's got the lip quiver.  We have to all agree that it will. 
[02:22:30]  He was just freezing in the meat locker where he works.  And then they go to the...  What do you have to do?  You have to deliver meals?  You have to deliver meals to the elderly or something in the middle of winter?  But this is the worst part.  The bass player, who's the shit at any band, he was his boss at the fucking vegetable factory  or wherever the fuck he worked.  So he's the one who makes all the vegetables and puts them in the tins.  This asshole has to go get it from the bass player.  And he's got an attitude and shit.  Like he has a chef's jacket on. 
[02:23:00]  He's fucking mixing vegetables.  You know, everybody who works at the restaurant makes fun of them.  Why are they still long-haired dudes?  They're in a band.  He walks by, they're like, metal on metal.  I love documentaries.  Talking about force.  This is one of the best documentaries, though.  I mean, they're at big, huge festivals in Europe.  And the guys that they came up with could give a shit that they're there.  And they're all excited.  Like, Lars is going to recognize them and stuff.  Oh, wow.  They just get the cold shoulder from everybody else in the business. 
[02:23:30]  And his own kid.  And whenever your kid is like, you know, they're like, what do you think of your dad's music?  And the kid's like, yeah.  At least to have the kid be like, no, my dad rocks.  That would, like, fill me up.  And instead, I ate two more large fries and stared at the northern lights.  And the family doesn't believe in him anymore.  Oh, our sister?  The sister's still giving him money to keep his dream alive because she's very rich, I guess.  Yeah.  He's fighting with club owners over $100 fucking, you know, $100 for a gig or something. 
[02:24:00]  All right, I got to see this now.  In Germany.  Oh, you're going to love it.  Did you guys see...  What about the tour manager crying on the train tracks?  Yeah, but she wasn't even a tour manager, right?  She was just a fan from Europe who wrote them and was like, I believe in you.  Yeah, that was banging one of the band members.  Yeah, but she kept fucking everything up.  Taking buses and rickshaws and shit.  That sounds like Spinal Tap.  Totally like...  It's shit.  Gets in charge.  It's pretty much it is.  I mean, the train goes and they're still on the platform.  And she breaks down crying.  And I forgot their names, but they're like, what do you mean you didn't buy tickets? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And now they're just stuck in the middle of Europe with no fucking plan.  And she's crying.  I have no heart for anybody who goes with the excuse of, I'm trying so hard for you.  How about fucking prepare a year in advance instead of trying to wing my career?  I am doing everything that I can to...  What?  You made one phone call to see if a train was coming.  Can you imagine Barry Katz doing that to you, James?  I can imagine.  I witnessed it. 
[02:25:00]  It's called the first five years of my career.  There's Alex out there.  There's the fucking...  What's up, Alex?  That's the man right there.  Alex is the main guy now?  We call him Tree Face.  Alex.  Yeah?  What's that?  He looks like an old man in a tree.  What the fuck?  Look at him.  Look at him.  What's he talking about?  Fucking big job.  That reminds me of when you talk about that whole, I'm trying.  I was sitting...  One of my pet peeves is when you're sitting in the green room at a club and there's no  waitress.  And you're sitting... 
[02:25:30]  There's no water.  There's no food or anything.  So three times I got to ask to get a waitress to come back.  I'm fucking starving before I do a show.  So finally this waitress comes walking in and she just goes, oh my God, I'm like the  worst waitress.  And I go, really?  Well, can you send the good one back here?  Because you called yourself out for sucking.  Like, now I'm supposed to accept it?  Oh, now it's funny.  Now it's funny because you said you suck.  So now you just enjoy it.  Now you go, oh my God, I'm the worst tipper ever.  So this is a great combination.  She read one of those dumb books about you got to own your own stuff so that nobody can 
[02:26:00]  take your power and fuck with it.  So she came in.  I am the worst ever.  What's my move on the chessboard?  I'm going to suck and still succeed.  Just admit to it before somebody calls you out on it.  There you go.  But you know what?  You take it to another level of like, yeah, your boyfriend must hate you.  Just something weird.  Oh, wow.  She walks away like, what?  Make her leave angry.  I'm a bad waitress, but I'm not a bad girlfriend.  How about she's going to spit in your food?  Do you worry about that? 
[02:26:30]  She probably will.  At a comedy club?  Well.  Probably make it taste better.  Fucking shitholes.  Stupid chicken rings.  We were talking about this last night.  Quesadillas.  Oh, fucking dumb quesadillas and skirt steak.  Fucking poor man's steak.  Like when you meet somebody and you go, oh, it's really nice too.  I meet you.  And they go, we've actually met before.  They pull that in front of other people.  This girl, oh, hey, yeah.  It's cool.  No, we actually meet, we met before.  And I'm just staring at her and everybody's kind of looking into that awkward moment. 
[02:27:00]  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on?  You don't remember.  That's what I mean.  You don't really remember.  I love that one too where it's like, hey, how you doing?  You're like, hey, what's up?  You don't remember me, do you?  It's like, why do you got to put me in that fucking position?  No, I don't.  You know, we know.  I don't.  No, I absolutely don't.  We meet a few people, you know, I might not remember fucking, you know.  I have cousins.  I don't even know their fucking name.  Yeah, exactly.  If people in my family at barbecues, like, who's that little cute girl?  You don't remember the time limit you talked? 
[02:27:30]  We talked for like a half hour at a party.  Oh, really?  Or they go, all right, what's my name?  Because sometimes I try to bluff and go, do you remember me?  I go, yeah, hell yeah.  What's my name?  All right, look, I gave you an out to feel good.  Now I'm just going to dive on you.  I have no fucking clue who you are.  I don't care about you.  I'm even bad if I know people.  Sometimes I get like a panic, like, oh, fuck.  If I was working with these two guys, I've known these guys for like 17 years.  If I was working with them just as a backup plan, I'm such a moron. 
[02:28:00]  And if I was hosting the show, I would write their names on my hands.  Not these guys, but you know what I mean?  Like, guys, you know what I mean?  I would literally have to be writing that.  That was my big panic as a host that I was going to forget the name.  I've had people come up and I'm like, all right, someone's coming.  I know the face.  I don't know the fucking name.  So you turn to whoever you're with and go, all right, I'll say hello.  Immediately introduce yourself.  Yes.  And I'll be like, I'll be like, oh, I'm so rude.  I'm sorry.  And then right when they say the name, you go like, Karen, Karen. 
[02:28:30]  This is Karen.  To try to make it seem like you knew it was.  It's a timing thing, though.  It is totally timing.  You've got to be good at that.  And then I blame myself.  I'm like, oh, I'm so fucking rude.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course.  I thought you guys met, but you guys didn't meet before?  Yeah, yeah, I thought you did all that shit.  I got that worked out with my girlfriend.  That's the deal.  I go, look, if I don't introduce you, in the first three seconds, introduce yourself.  And go, my name is rude.  Yes.  And I'm the asshole.  The worst thing is when your girl says, you know, hey, I'm Karen.  And then the other guy goes, oh, hey, how's it going?  You're like, fuck, say your name. 
[02:29:00]  What's your name?  Say your name.  Here's your job to get both their names.  I get so paranoid with being the guy that goes, what's up, bro?  Because usually, hey, what's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Leads to it.  Then I try to get clever.  And I'm like, muchacho.  And I end up calling some weird.  You're going to Chief Champ.  You're going everywhere.  What the fuck is your name?  I get my nickname.  Captain.  The fucking bro thing used to work, though.  You could get out of situations.  Yeah, I know.  You're saying, hey, bro, what's up, man?  Here's the worst one I've had recently.  I went to town to this club, and there was some guy, some chef at a restaurant, right? 
[02:29:30]  He was a big fan.  So, yeah, come on down.  So we go down there.  And this guy feeds us like it's the last Thanksgiving ever.  Everything on the menu.  It was, like, bizarre.  Like, we had, like, shrimp, and then waffles came out.  It was unreal.  But it was all delicious.  And I hung out and talked to this guy for 45 minutes.  And he goes, yeah, I'm coming out to the late show tonight.  I go, all right, dude.  Well, hang on.  I'll get you a DVD.  Thank you so much, blah, blah, blah.  So the end of the show, the guy stands in line like a regular person.  So I'm totally in robot mode going, hey, did you have a good time? 
[02:30:00]  All right, thanks a lot.  So the guy who just made me a free meal, I'm talking.  He's like, hey, what's going on?  I'm like, hey, man, did you have a good time?  Do you want a DVD or something like that?  And the guy's looking at me.  And I totally didn't even recognize him.  Did he pay for it?  No, he ended up walking away.  And then the middleman comes up to me.  And he goes, oh, did you see Chef Chris?  Chef Chris came out.  And I go, oh, fuck.  And I didn't panic.  I said, no, no, but I went down to his restaurant the next day with DVD and Hannah.  I was just like, dude, you got to understand, people come up to you and they say, my brother 
[02:30:30]  just died.  He liked your comedy.  They're just like bizarre shit.  People slapping you on the back.  He's like, yeah, thanks, right.  Go fuck yourself, sir.  I was still full from what the guy fucking cooked me.  And I couldn't remember.  I couldn't remember.  Just wanted to make sure that shrimp and what was it, waffles?  Yeah, well, shrimp and waffles.  Is he a chef at a fucking IHOP?  No, it's a waffles.  Isn't that a Paula Ponson album?  Shrimp and waffles?  No, exactly. 
[02:31:00]  Have you ever taken a shrimp and waffles and shrimp and the waffles?  It's the most disgusting thing that you could possibly be to kiss him from shrimp and the waffles.  She's brilliant.  I'm leaning over a stool and contorting myself at the shrimp and the waffles.  Fucking days.  Oh, god damn.  Pull a sound stone with that.  She sucks.  Oh, those early 90s.  She's horrendous.  Yeah.  We got it. 
[02:31:30]  You're gay.  You ever watch the Young Comedian specials?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And just watch how fucking atrocious comedy was back then?  Even the name guys were like, you know.  You watch the old ones.  Because I remember seeing the one with Seinfeld on it and fucking shit.  And you watch the act and go like, wow.  I saw one they did in New York and some gay guy with fucking just great hair.  Some what?  And a big gay guy with gray hair.  No, yeah.  I said great hair.  Oh, that was back in the day you did?  I did.  You're a model, motherfucker.  You're some nice hair. 
[02:32:00]  I could have been in Menudo.  And he had the fuzziest pink.  It was just this hairy, fuzzy pink sweater.  Right.  It was so hot.  He just made the wrong choice in wardrobe.  And he was sweating the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That music.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,  wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  It was always like a Casio keyboard with some really cheesy saxophone.  There's always a bouncer at the front door of the club.  Yeah.  It was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  And they turn, and they do the fake freeze, but they're still kind of moving.  Yeah.  There's the name.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And then when they show the performer, he's got to do that surprise look like he doesn't  know the camera, like the double take, huh?  Hey.  Then he runs to the backside entrance, and he enters this.  It's a bad cut to the stage, too.  It's like, no, I'm running right from the alley, right on the...  Back then.  Balance is all wrong.  He's got, yeah.  He's gotten a haircut since the big opening.  one comic's putting his fucking jacket in a locker and like comics get lockers 
[02:33:00]  they're on a like hbo classic now every so often they pop on and you're like you see guys that  wound up becoming huge and then these other guys are like who's that yeah that's like he just  fucking muddled his way through comedy clubs and never made a dent nothing not nothing guy with the  pink sweater was just sweating his whole set yeah do you remember there was a guy on stand-up 
[02:33:30]  spotlight every time he would do when he would finish his act he would do a backflip  like he was doing the ymca he just do the y he would do that and i remember this before i got  in comedy and i was embarrassed i actually liked the guy i was literally like the moron comedy fan  like this is the guy who does the backflip he's the backflip guy totally solved i hope he's in a  motorized wheelchair now running it with his mouth because he fucked up one night  i i heard the new comedy i did a backflip what's the comic's name that was in the wheelchair we

[02:59:30]  So I'm left with Bill Burr and Bob Kelly, which is fine by me.  All right.  I didn't know where you were going with it.  So I'm left with it.  I'm just kind of like setting the table for everybody out there in radio land.  Point guard.  I'm sitting in Anthony's seat.  I see that.  I want to push a button.  Go ahead.  Push anything.  All right, then.  I got it from a Negro.  Of course.  Of course, you're sitting in Anthony's seat.  Of course, you're sitting in Anthony's seat.  Of course, you are.  Of course, that's the one that had a play. 
[03:00:00]  And you did randomly just, you know, pop a button.  Yeah.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Yeah, see.  Ah, what a movie.  This calls for the old Billy Burrell.  Billy, Billy.  So Madison Square Garden tonight, boys.  You ready for this?  Your days of finger banging.  Or we can push buttons.  Mary Jane Rottencrotch, through her pretty pink panties, are over.  Madison Square Garden, absolutely.  Scared? 
[03:00:30]  Nervous?  No.  It's a little different.  It's in the round.  It's one of those things where it's just like whatever happens is going to happen.  Right.  There's no pressure because it's not my show.  Right.  But his fans are the nicest people in the fucking universe.  Oh, are they?  Unlike the ONA audience.  Is that what you're trying to say, Bobby?  This is what I'm nervous about.  I'm nervous that, like, it's going to be a bunch of Facebook hotties.  And I'm going to be up there talking about why I'm pro-swine flu.  And they're going to be looking at me like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Wait, why are you pro-swine flu? 
[03:01:00]  We're looking at you like that now.  I kind of agree with you without even knowing what you're going to say.  Mother Nature keeps trying to help us out and keeps going like, what are we going to do with all this garbage?  There's a cesspool of plastic and shit, like twice the size of Texas, and it's like a mile deep.  They don't even know how the fuck they're going to clean it up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  Mother Nature is trying to fucking help us out by whacking a few of us.  And we don't listen.  Cleaning out the closet.  A renewal.  The same reason why the forest catches on fire and then new stuff sprouts and we won't let her fucking do it. 
[03:01:30]  And every time it's going to be a bigger roundhouse, I'm telling you, we're on our way to a Will Smith movie.  I'm on the same page as you.  You just don't want it to be you that has to be part of this.  Exactly.  It's going to get the weak ones.  Huh?  It's going to get the weak ones.  We're all going to get the swine flu.  A lot of us will get it this season.  You just take your vitamins.  Yeah.  Everybody else.  First of all, I love all these fucking idiots running out to get that little, the new serum.  You know?  People don't understand that doctors practice medicine. 
[03:02:00]  They're practicing it.  So you don't want to get the new shit.  No.  You want to get the shit that's been rehearsed.  Like the hair plugs we were fucking talking about.  The hair plugs from the 70s are fucking horrific.  Look at them now.  They're great.  That's because they fucked up Elton John's head practicing on him.  That poor guy's been wearing a wig since 1978.  So now this swine flu shit is new.  You don't go down there with that serum that the CIA and their witch doctors came up with.  They don't know what the fuck it's going to do to you.  There's no fucking way I'm getting that.  They don't know what it's going to do to you.  No fucking way.  If 10 years from now we're still dealing with the swine flu, then maybe. 
[03:02:30]  I'm like, okay, they've figured out the vaccination by now.  Vitamin C, raisin bran, and eight hours sleep.  You're good.  You're good.  I like when you go on the plane and those fucking foreigners always have the masks on and shit.  It's like, what do you know that we don't know?  What's so funny is that Alex, the kid that, and Dane's a dude.  Yeah.  He got a little sniffle.  Oh, he was the guy?  You told the story there.  Tell Bill.  He made him wear a fucking surgical mask for three days, 24 hours a day. 
[03:03:00]  The only time he could take it off was when he was alone in his own room.  Wait, no joke he was doing or was he just breaking his balls?  No.  Wear it.  Wear it.  I was funny.  Was he doing it to be funny?  No.  Was he seriously paranoid?  No.  We're on the fucking plane.  He's sniffling a coffin.  Made him wear it.  And not even like a regular one.  It had like a, it was like a painter's one with the little, the plastic air pocket in  the front of it.  I'm surprised he didn't send him home.  Just send him home.  Just make him ride with the luggage. 
[03:03:30]  Well, he did have to ride in the back, right?  I wanted to fucking get a Sharpie and make a Sufi on it.  Are you guys still touring?  Yeah, we leave tomorrow.  After tonight we go, uh, to the Roman Coliseum.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, where do you go from here?  Virginia.  No, but I mean, when, after you play all these arenas like this.  He's the biggest comedian.  As far as ticket sales go, you can argue, because once you get to that level, it becomes all  preference.  But as far as like how long he's been selling out Madison Square Garden and arenas to that 
[03:04:00]  level.  I mean, there's, there's been guys who've done stuff like that, but it's always been like  a year, year and a half.  Yeah, but this tour.  He's going on four or five years.  Well, I asked him, I go, how many times have you played Madison Square Garden?  He goes, this is my fifth time.  Dude, he did like two shows there one night.  I got two shows Saturday night in Madison Square Garden.  It's unbelievable.  Me and Jimmy saw him do that in Boston at the old, uh, fucking, uh, Fleet Center.  It's got the same road schedule as the Celtics.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he turned that place around.  He did two shows at the Fleet Center in Boston. 
[03:04:30]  Me and Jimmy, waitresses were clearing up fucking tables to clear out 20,000 people.  And they had one huge line waiting to get in as everyone else was leaving.  That is fucked up, man.  That is some fucked up shit.  Yeah, that was weird.  It's weird to do the shows and you're playing on the Cavs, real basketball hoop.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They set it up in the back.  We're just fucking playing horsey with their hoop.  Oh, dude, that's so awesome.  Yeah.  I went on a hockey trip last year.  I went to, uh, Calgary Flames, the Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver Canucks. 
[03:05:00]  And these guys, they did two out, two out of three of the stadiums I went to.  Really?  Yeah.  How many, uh, arenas have you been to for hockey?  I've been, I've been to all, all, all but like six of them.  I've been, as far as like professional sports franchises, I've been in like, I almost a hundred,  like 98 or 99 of them.  Wow.  I got to do something on the road, dude.  I'm going to go nuts.  I can't keep going to cheesecake factories and fucking watching fat people stumble out of  there.  So you just go and see the local sports, uh, the entire.  This is what I do.  They'll say, you want to go to Seattle?  And I'll be like, yes, I do. 
[03:05:30]  And then I go to the NFL schedule.  Fucking smart, man.  And I fucked up though.  I thought Seattle was in town and then not.  So.  Seattle's a great city though.  Awesome city.  I love Seattle.  Seattle's great.  I was there once and it was three days of, uh, beautiful sunshine.  Like I could live here and they're like, well, let me tell you about Seattle and then  explain how the rain thing is, is a real deal.  Yeah.  Why Kurt Cobain ended up the way he did.  Did you go by his house?  Who, Kurt Cobain?  Yeah.  Where he killed himself?  No.  Why would I do that?  Why not?  I'd love that morbid shit. 
[03:06:00]  See if there's any rain matter on the window.  Nah, you can't get too close, but it's a house right on the lake in, uh, Seattle.  What club are you playing in Seattle?  Uh, Giggles.  Giggles Comedy Club with Crazy Terry.  Pays you with a shoebox full of cash.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Oh, he's hilarious.  This is this guy, well, like, he's such a cheap bastard.  I love the guy because I, I like, I like the independent clubs, you know, and I like  how, uh, he's just a character.  The guy's out of his mind.  He basically, he, you come into headline, he does no fucking advertising and he freaks 
[03:06:30]  the fuck out every time.  Yeah, but it's all one fucking ticket.  And it's like, dude, deal with that.  It's like, dude, you could have Jesus coming down there if you don't have someone with a  sandwich board, something, letting people know I'm coming to town, you asshole.  You gotta, you gotta at least do the minimum for me.  He's a maniac, though, right?  But he's such a fucking psycho.  He's hilarious.  So, in front of me, there's like seven guys every night and they're all doing six minutes  and he's not paying any of them.  And it just keeps going.  Coming up next, people are like, okay, is this the headliner?  It's like a telethon. 
[03:07:00]  On the weekend?  Yeah, on the weekend.  And then afterwards, he starts telling me which comics, why they're not gonna make it  right in front of him.  And he's such a psycho that they're not even phased by it.  And I'm like, why would you do that to this news guy?  Isn't that the guy that waits tables, does the door, bartends?  And he's rude as hell to his customers.  But somehow they think...  How's he still in business?  I don't know.  But that's what I love about it.  It's fucking Seattle.  Hey, let's do it.  That's what I love about it.  Larry shouldn't have said all that shit.  It's a great club and I love performing. 
[03:07:30]  When are you gonna be there?  I think it's on your schedule, man.  It's on my schedule.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sometime in December.  Okay.  Gonna be in Cleveland at Hilarious the week before.  Going to a Browns game there, Bobby.  The Browns.  Me and Norton did a show for the Browns.  We did a comedy show.  Did a comedy?  You want to talk about fucking taking a...  A dump?  It's just all rookies.  Just huge, huge black dudes.  And me and Norton doing our stand-up.  And LL Cool J is the headliner.  It was terrible.  Why would you take that gig?  That was the week you guys got fucking douched off the air. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, I remember, Bobby.  Thanks for having me.  Why would you take that gig?  Fucking commas.  Hey.  The money was good.  Let's go to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry!  Larry wants to come back to the swine flu conspiracy.  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Larry?  What's up?  Hey, Bill.  This kind of flows right up your alley with the conspiracy theory stuff.  I was told by a doctor when I was getting...  Actually was debating on getting this...  The flu virus inoculation. 
[03:08:30]  And one doctor had said to me, it's useless to even worry about it, number one, because everybody...  Like you just said, everybody's going to get it.  But one of these companies, either Merck or Pfizer, already had that inoculation planned  out five years ago, knowing that this thing was coming.  Now, how did we all of a sudden know that there was a flu coming five years ago and we  just got it this year?  Exactly. 
[03:09:00]  Exactly.  It's business.  There's no...  There's a great line I heard from someone in the medical field going, there's no money  in the cure.  The cure is in the treatment.  Exactly.  So, there's nobody...  There's no checks and balances for anybody anymore.  I mean, fucking bankers just stole a trillion dollars.  They kept it.  They don't even get any say where it is and nobody's doing anything about it.  So, what would stop these guys?  Right.  I heard, like, the Food and Drug Administration, half the guys who work in there used to work  for the big companies that kind of control the food supply.  Like, the whole thing is just... 
[03:09:30]  It's beyond corrupt.  It's all a crock of shit.  We're not in this to...  You know, we don't make the money from this end.  And, you know, all the money is made on the medical...  The medicine end of it.  It's not made anywhere else.  How much does it cost to get the flu shot?  How much is that?  Fuck that.  I just want to get...  Yeah, why would you do that?  How much is it?  I'm just wondering how much...  Don't even take the chance, man.  I'm not...  There was a time they told...  I'm not going to.  I'm just asking if anybody knows.  What was it?  What was the big one where they told the mothers...  What was it?  A fucking vaccination or something?  And they all had flipper babies? 
[03:10:00]  They said that shit was safe.  Yeah.  What was that?  Help me out.  When they put too much fluoride in the water...  Remember those kids when you grew up and they had, like, freckles on their teeth?  Yeah.  Remember those white circles?  Yeah.  Because they put too much chloride?  They basically poisoned the water supply.  Is that why they had that?  Yeah.  I never knew that.  Something like too much...  That's what I asked.  Like, why do you have chicken pots on your front teeth?  Oh, there was too much fluoride one time.  And, like, really? 
[03:10:30]  And you just accepted that?  You know, I'm looking at the swine flu differently for real.  I want someone to give it to me and get it over with.  Instead of wondering when I'm going to fucking get it.  I take a lot of...  I get a lot of peace in knowing you can only die once.  That's what always brings me back around to feeling good.  That's wonderful, Bill.  Hey, you can only die once.  Is that going to be in your new book?  Huh?  You only die once.  No, but I have an uplifting message.  Get a dog.  It's the greatest fucking thing you'll ever do.  How great is a dog?  Oh, dude.  I almost got one of your dogs.  A guy was walking through a mall with this silver... 
[03:11:00]  What was it?  A silver...  A blue-eyed...  What is it called?  It's a pit bull, but the coloring is a blue nose.  It's not a type of pit bull.  These assholes...  You know, nobody on the internet can just tell you you're wrong.  They got to...  Hey, shit, dick!  Yeah.  It's like, why can't you just...  You know, why can't you just say...  Oh, by the way, a lot of people think a blue nose is a type.  It's just a color.  Dude, it's the fucking greatest goddamn dog.  Fucking delete all of it.  Shredded.  As soon as they fucking say shit, shut the fuck up.  I delete them.  I love blocking people.  It's my new happiness thing.  You're not scared of the dog anymore?  I remember when you first got it. 
[03:11:30]  You were a little timid there, Bill.  You were a little timid.  Oh, dude.  Bobby, I'm telling you.  A guy was selling it 400 bucks at the mall.  Let me see it.  At the Glendale Mall.  Dude, I'm going to tell you right now.  You get that dog.  You now have...  You have a bouncer.  The joke I've been doing in my act, it's like a gun you can pet.  Dude, it's fucking...  And they're loyal as hell.  They're fucking loyal as hell.  But what you really have to do, Bob, is you got to...  I'm really reading up on them.  It's a responsibility when you have...  Like, those little fucking dogs are the worst... 
[03:12:00]  The owners of those dogs are so fucking bad because the dogs are not in control and everybody  thinks it's funny.  What, the little dogs?  Because they're just...  Dude, my dogs don't even fuck around, dude.  I fucking...  I sit, come, stay.  I don't fuck around.  You're a good owner, but a lot of people aren't.  So what happens is if you're a bad owner, the bigger dog you get, the bigger the problem  is going to be...  Dude, if you have a little dog, what's it going to do?  Nibble at my ankle?  Right.  Okay, break the skin or whatever?  If you're a fucking bad owner and you get a bigger dog like that... 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  And all the hype on pit bulls is bullshit.  It's just the dog they're picking on right now.  When I was a kid, it was all Dobermans.  I never even heard of a fucking pit bull.  Everybody was just like...  Actually, German Shepherds are the worst dogs because they bite more people a year than  any other dog, a German Shepherd.  I guarantee you it's a smaller dog.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Because you know what?  Those little dogs, dude, they don't even fucking report them.  It is.  Hold on.  Nobody reports them.  You might be right.  If a dog's hound bites you, they don't put it down.  If a pit bull does, they do.  Bill, we were talking...  Hold on.  We were talking about this yesterday.  The one dog you're scared of.  And I came up with German Shepherd.  I'm more scared of German Shepherds than the pit bulls. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Because it's the police dog of choice.  What's the one dog you're scared of?  I'll do it.  It's got to be the Doberman, man.  The Doberman?  That looks like a hell of a house.  That is the number one dog you'd be scared of.  Dude, when those ears are straight up, man, and that expressionless look, I absolutely  love it.  I think I'm not scared of them because I only see them in movies.  I don't think I've ever seen a Doberman.  Dude, a Doberman could kill a fucking horse.  I've never seen one on his life.  It could kill a horse.  I swear to God.  Bobby, what about you?  It's a German Shepherd.  I had a German Shepherd follow me home when I was a little kid, and I went to check its 
[03:13:30]  collar, and it bit through my hand.  And then it bit the cop that came down.  Who was named Robert Kelly?  We're in the paper.  I still love the article.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah, but I guarantee you.  You know what's the bad thing, too, is when you get a dog like that, the amount of fucking  people who don't know how to approach a dog.  Yeah.  They just walk right up.  Dude, they look right in the eye.  It's like if you were sitting on the subway, and some guy's looking at you in the eye, you're  going to be like, dude, what the fuck is your problem?  Of course.  They don't understand.  They walk right.  Same thing with dogs and animals.  Yeah, I'm sitting there, and this guy comes up, and he's looking at my dog.  He goes, hey, hey, and he's like snapping right in his face. 
[03:14:00]  The dog's like, well, wait, what are you doing?  You're sitting there eating, and some guy started snapping in your face.  Did you say something to him?  You'd be like, what the fuck?  No, my girl had the dog at the time, and the guy gave us this look like, oh, pit bulls.  It's like, no, douchebag.  You're an idiot.  Yeah.  People also, really, they have an excited sound like, hey, how are you?  The dog's like, what the fuck?  What's going on?  You're not supposed to do that.  You're supposed to be relaxed, calm.  You're not supposed to look in the eye.  You're supposed to let the dog approach you, let him sniff you out.  But then, you also have to hope that the owner understands the dog. 
[03:14:30]  So the bottom fucking line is, you shouldn't approach any fucking dog.  Any dog.  Because you don't know if the owner is a good dog or not.  You don't know what the fuck the dog is.  But people love dogs, so they come walking up like fucking idiots all the time.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you fucking, do you give it a swack?  Do you fucking hit it?  No.  You should never hit your dog in anger.  What you do, what you do.  Not in anger, but just, you know, like, sit the fuck down.  No.  What you do is, you just, it's all repetition and reward. 
[03:15:00]  And what you do is, the dog has to know what the fuck it's supposed to do.  If it knows what it's supposed to do, it doesn't freak out in that situation.  And you teach that by repetition.  But I'll be honest with you, dude.  I don't take the dog out to public places anymore because of the way people were approaching the dog.  Right.  And it'd be a new environment, so he's getting new to it.  And I'd be, you know, sit down, I snap, it sits down and all that.  But then somebody comes up with that, that, oh, that kind of voice.  So they snap in his face or they just, they, they, they approach real quick. 
[03:15:30]  Like, you ever see that shit where that bear attacks that woman?  If you notice, the bear is actually scared.  Because she, you watch the way she shows up.  She sort of sneaks in behind him.  The bear thought it was getting fucking ambushed.  And she triggered that.  I love how I'm talking like I'm a fucking animal expert here.  But that's what I can do.  You sound great.  Yeah, you're a dog whisperer.  That's where I really, well, that's where the dog whisperer.  No, but that's where I learned a lot of the shit that I watch.  But he also has books.  And like, it's common fucking sense. 
[03:16:00]  And people are idiots when they approach.  Now, what, we're watching the video here.  Now, watch while this, see how she just sort of snuck down and the bear doesn't know.  Now, watch the double take he does.  He doesn't even fucking know she's there.  And says, whoa, fuck.  That's what it is.  Oh, my God.  Fucking idiot.  What kind of idiot sits next to a grizzly bear?  YNC.com, I think, is hosting that video.  Hey, by the way, everyone is defending their dogs on instant feedback.  Relax.  We're just saying in our dumb little minds what we're scared of.  Because people are like, look, German Shepherds are great dogs.  I understand. 
[03:16:30]  Dude, every dog's a great dog.  But everyone is scared of something.  It comes down to the owner.  The owner has to be a good owner.  And you have to not be a fucking idiot and startle the dog.  Remember when you were probably, yeah, a kid growing up, whatever, and you went to someone's house.  And they had one of these dogs.  These, like, intimidating dogs.  And they would give you all sorts of.  The dogs that's running the house.  Yeah.  And they would give you all sorts of rules as you're visiting this person.  Like, all right, don't make any sudden moves.  Don't look him in the eye.  Don't do this.  Don't do that.  And you would just sit there going, when is this fucking dog going to attack me?  Yeah, but most people.  I can't be perfect while I'm in your house. 
[03:17:00]  Most people treat a dog like it's a member of the family.  And it's not.  It's a fucking dog.  Like, I had to take my wife out of that mode.  It's not a little kid.  It's not a baby.  It's a fucking dog.  It used to live outside.  Stop fucking.  Because my dog's dog.  If my wife says, sit.  You hit your dog, don't you?  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, he does.  If I hit my dog, I'd break it.  Just because you were hit as a kid, you shouldn't be hitting your dog, Bobby.  I'd break their spine.  They're so little.  I'd fucking kill them.  You can tell.  Yeah, you can tell.  I don't hit my dog.  You want a rolled-up newspaper?  Are you that guy?  I don't.  A rolled-up newspaper guy?  I don't hit my dogs.  I don't hit my dogs. 
[03:17:30]  You really?  Bobby is from another era.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Depression era Bobby.  I don't hit my dogs.  Only when they get.  What's your technique?  Did you box to get out of the Irish ghetto?  What's your technique?  I am.  Rolled-up newspaper, frying pan.  What do you use?  I just use my hand.  No, I don't hit my dog.  Hey, by the way, I knew it was a thalidomide.  My dog, my dog, my, I'm sorry.  We're going to, all right.  Well, we keep talking about dogs.  My dog's fucked up, though, because when I first got it, I was driving around.  It's, you know, so small.  It's that little silky terrier.  I was driving around L.A., Beverly Hills, with it on my lap, with the window open. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, gosh.  And at one point, it just said, fuck it.  Just one hopped out the window while I'm moving.  I was trying to escape.  Dude, my heart, I fucking just, I spun out in the middle of the road.  It almost got, and then I was flipping out, and I just saw it running, and it came, and  I'm like, fucking don't ever fucking do that again.  And it fucked it up.  Like, it fucked it up.  One dog goes one way, and the other dog goes the other way. 
[03:18:30]  And this guy's saying, what do you want from me?  Huh?  Doing buttons.  I like that.  I just did that, too.  One dog goes one way.  So what's happening, Bobby?  It fucked it up for life, dude.  If it hears any sound, it's just fucked.  It just shakes and quivers.  Yeah, this is one that I learned.  Like, you know, like when your dog barks when someone's at the door?  Yeah.  You don't yell at it, because what it's doing is it's protecting you.  So what you do is it just has a spot where it's supposed to go, and then you tell it  to stay. 
[03:19:00]  And this is the thing.  If it comes out, you put it right back where the fuck it's supposed to be.  You just keep doing that before you open the door, and then it stays.  And then once you, you know, get your food that you ordered, you shut it, then you reward  it.  I do that.  You say good dog.  No, my dogs, when I, they don't even go in the house, I go in first.  They don't, they don't go in front of me.  Yeah, you got to do that.  They go, I go in first, and then they come in, and then the next door, I go in first, and  I don't let them in the house, the only way they can go in the house is when I say, okay.  Yeah.  And then they run in the house.  That's how you're supposed to, you don't walk, you don't let the dog walk you down the street  and decide where it's supposed to go.  It's supposed to be right by your side, and you decide where you go. 
[03:19:30]  I can walk my dogs, and literally five minutes will piss and shit.  My wife's out there for fucking 45 minutes up and down.  He wanted to go by the street.  That's because your dogs are scared of you.  No, they're not scared of you.  Yeah, you probably pick up a tree limb or something.  No, dude, don't tell me how.  You just fucking, you just fucking make sure.  Bobby hits his dog.  I live with Bobby, and Bobby, Bobby, just admit it, get it over with.  I love my girl dog.  We'll get you some therapy.  If I yell diva, if I diva, she'll run, lie on her back, and bend her paws, and just show 
[03:20:00]  me your fucking belly.  I'm going to tell you something.  Bobby, he uses force.  I'm telling you.  Bobby would be a dirty cop.  He already has the fucking, he has the dirty cop jacket on.  Look, you look like a Boston cop right now.  The guy rides the motorcycle.  I used to, when I used to live with him, funniest shit ever.  Like, somehow, like, he was, like, subletting my apartment, this fucking one bedroom, like,  walk through shit, right?  And, um, I'd come back from L.A., and somehow, every time I came back, and I still had stuff  in the apartment, somehow, my shit would always get broken. 
[03:20:30]  Really?  He would always break my shit.  I don't know what happened.  He'd be frustrated with the business, and he fucking, I remember one time, dude, one  time, he, I think, I know I already told this story, but who gives a shit, he broke my fan.  Dude, and I'm telling you, right?  The fucking thing was in, was shattered.  And I go, dude, how the fuck did you break?  And he goes, dude, dude, you know, I was, I was laying there, I was sleeping, and somebody  knocked on the door, it startled me, and I, I woke up in a fluster. 
[03:21:00]  That was his excuse, a fluster.  The cord was wrapped around my ankle, and I fucking just ran, and the fucking thing went  flying.  No, he didn't.  Did you know how much fucking pussy I got in that apartment?  Dude, the fucking, the fan blade was surrounded by a birdcage.  How hard did you hit the fucking thing?  The birdcage fell off.  I took that off.  Oh, now you're admitting?  That was a really hot one.  All these years later, you could actually give me more air if I took that off.  Admit to Bill what really happened.  Bobby's one of those guys you can't loan shit to, like, remember back in the day, if you 
[03:21:30]  gave somebody, you're like, hey, can I borrow your cassette tape, and they come  back, and there'd be, like, ashes, and all, like, the names of the songs would be rubbed  off?  I do.  I don't know what happened.  I just stuck it in the radio.  Fucking ashes.  There's, like, syrup on it.  Out of all the guys that come in here, I know your problem, and I know your problem.  Both guys.  What, tempers?  Yeah, they've got three hotheads.  Yeah, there's three hotheads in there right now.  Oh, yeah.  And we all know it, too.  We look in each other's eyes, and it's like this, it's a standoff, because it's like, 
[03:22:00]  God, do I really want to go down this road, because I know it's going to be ugly for everybody  involved.  Yeah, but we're all...  It's going to be ugly for me.  It's going to be ugly for Bill.  Bobby, do you think that, you know, you could kill somebody?  Yeah, I just talked about that the other day.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think I was made to kill somebody.  You just never crossed the line.  Like, the way I can compartmentalize not only my emotions, but also the level of anger,  I would just have to do that one, and once I had resigned myself that I was going  to hell anyways.  No, a friend of mine said, when you have kids, you realize you could kill somebody. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because you just protect them, and when you see, like, other adults treating your kids  bad, especially, you realize at that moment, holy shit, I am capable of killing somebody.  We all sort of think, are you capable?  Have you ever thought of...  I thought the other day with my dog.  I was like, my dog ever bit somebody, and then the cops came, and they were going to  take him away.  I already fantasized punching a cop in the face, and him flying down the stairs, as if I could  do that.  He put me in one of those cops, chicken wings.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Right, right, right, right, right. 
[03:23:00]  One of those L.A. choke holds.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  They practice that stuff.  Thalidomide babies.  I knew that, just to get that info out.  That was the fucking thing that made all these women have, you know, flipper babies.  What was it called?  They were called thalidomide babies.  But it was something that they said was safe, and all the fucking pregnant women were taken,  and then next thing you know, they're having flipper babies.  That's why I'm scared of the swine flu, to get back to that, because it hasn't been  out there long enough.  And even after all the lawsuits, the guys who came up with that shit are still sitting  on yachts.  I'm telling you.  Uh-huh. 
[03:23:30]  One of the biggest lies in the world is like when someone fucks you over, no way, he'll  get his.  He'll get his.  You know what?  They don't.  They never get theirs.  They don't.  You're so fucking right.  They don't.  They rarely get theirs.  That only happens in movies.  I agree with that.  If someone's a fucking cunt to you, and you're like, you know what?  One of these days, he's going to be a cunt to the wrong fucking person, dude.  Trust me.  He's going to get his.  They don't.  They marry hot women, and they have Corvettes.  That's true.  Kevin's spitting the whole killing someone thing.  He goes, oh, you're right.  I could kill my kids.  There's also that out there. 
[03:24:00]  The parents that know they could kill their own kids.  When they're a teenager, they think they know shit.  Have you ever thought it through, like through killing somebody?  Like in New York City, you know, something happens, and fucking just killing somebody.  No comment.  All the way through.  No fucking comment.  I have.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I'm saying no comment.  Yeah, you're going to end up like Robert Blake.  Shut the fuck out.  And when you get put up on trial, they're going to show this footage.  Right, right.  I could fucking kill someone.  Yeah, no comment.  My girl was watching something the other day.  I figured it out.  I was watching something the other day where the, it was on, she was watching this thing  on Madonna, the whole Vogue scene. 
[03:24:30]  It was like these gay guy transvestite things, right?  And she, she called me up and she told me that one of them had a body, mummified, like just  wrapped it in, in, in, uh, actually the fucking dude gets killed.  I don't know.  I think she killed him or he killed him, whatever the fuck you call him, wrapped it up  in duct tape, then plastic, duct tape again, plastic, like fucking like nine times and  moved from apartment to apartment and just left, just kept putting the body in the closet  like it was a canoe for fucking, for like eight, eight apartments. 
[03:25:00]  How'd he get caught?  I forget.  There was the usual shit.  There was a fire and you got to run out and she's running with a, a body shaped canoe.  Did it smell?  No, because I guess they had it wrapped up so much.  I mean, I'm basically, I didn't watch it.  It's got to still smell.  She called me up.  Dude, did I ever tell you that one out in LA, that, what that guy did?  Uh-uh.  I was talking about, I was renting some, uh, what do you, what do you call it?  Storage space.  You know, when your life's up in the air, I'm going to live on both sides of the country.  Let's see how this works out. 
[03:25:30]  So I had shit.  It's called February this year.  Yeah.  I had shit in storage space, right?  And they were telling me this story of how this guy, he had a, he had a meat freezer.  You already know where this is going.  But in this storage space, all right?  And he paid cash for his, uh, for his, his space.  So there was no record of it.  And he would come in like once a week to check on it.  And, uh, the guy ends up having a fucking heart attack.  He's in the hospital for a couple, I don't know how long he couldn't pay his bill.  They shut off the electricity in it.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:26:00]  And all of a sudden this, this ooze starts coming out of the fucking thing.  It's his fucking wife and kids were in there and kids.  Yeah.  He killed his kids.  Now, granted, I never researched it to see if that was true.  He said wife, whatever, but, and kids.  Yeah.  That's what makes it.  You know, I realized I never even researched it to see if that's true.  That's just one of those things the lady at the, behind the desk told me.  Could be an urban legend.  Yeah.  You know what?  You had best un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck.  All right, Bobby.  That's pretty, you got a, you got a neck for it.  You're doing all right with that.  Let's try something else. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Bobby, you know what I think?  I think you're a great guy and you're really talented.  Where is that private pile?  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You push the Jelly Donut button.  Did you read Slash's book?  It was great.  What a great read.  And when Guns N' Roses...  Dude, I hate reading, so it's got to be something like that.  Did you read it, though?  For real?  Oh, it was awesome.  Where Guns N' Roses, they were living out of those fucking places when they were making it?  Oh, yeah.  They didn't have anywhere to go, so they rented these fucking, you know, storage facilities 
[03:27:00]  and they were living in there yeah they had one or two and they were having all sorts of parties  at night and those things yeah like the commitment that those guys it's hard enough to make it as an  individual slash's book was great oh it starts off with like the pacemaker oh it's fucking great i  just i just got it i never thought i'm reading it no read it suck like those you can read in two  days most of those books stink uh no and what i also like of is you really saw like the uh the  psychology of how the band worked where it just thought it looked like slash was just one of those 
[03:27:30]  he just all he wanted to deal with was playing right so that's kind of how like axel was able  to keep taking more and more and more control right because no one really like put their foot down with  the guy to be like dude no this is a group here you're acting like a cunt yeah they could have  kind of they could have controlled it we would have had a few more uh fucking albums from the band  worst follow-up idea ever what from appetite was to to have two double the usual illusion just so  much just fucking make two albums it was like war and peace there was four albums worth of shit i've 
[03:28:00]  still yet to buy them i just i could i and there's was overwhelming they could have made one amazing  album and then still had leftover songs that would have would have been a great start for the next  album you're so right we're playing monday morning quarterback dude you know what they should have  done why why put out a double album you gotta yeah you broke the number one rule leave them wanting  more what was the what was the last uh what am i trying to say the double album double album that  that that did well uh the red hot chili peppers did that one do well fuck i don't even know the 
[03:28:30]  name of it what are you talking about the one that has danny california on it and uh that was a double  album yeah i just listened to all of it getting because i just downloaded the songs i liked from  that then i didn't know that because double albums were big for a while and then they went away when you  get to that when you get to the the the some of the last songs on the second side of a fucking  double album you know when you're on the force yeah it's rough yeah it's like the drummer with  the ukulele yes they let the drummer sing the song i was like ah what the hell no one's gonna get 
[03:29:00]  this word it gets a little rough i know you have that song you've been trying to push on us for  years i want you to sing it  jesus mommy this scene stinks it's like watching a tennis match tennis match i keep going back and  forth between you guys why we're on my head i don't like sitting over there i just focus on you  why fuck that you guys are sitting way over there so i told you to sit in an seat so i didn't feel  like i was being interrogated yeah you'll be in the pack leader yeah let's say hi to uh brendan in

[03:31:30]  fucking dog whisperer like it was on the tv for five seconds i always i openly admit i have no  what do they do i have to use your illusion but i'm confused was that the spaghetti incident that's  where they made the big mistake that's the real mistake look first of all what i still i still think  that the two double albums is too much material and it was just like they were so huge no one could  tell them no they were like in their pacino years where he's just screaming his lines and they're 
[03:32:00]  like oh it's fucking al pacino what am i gonna tell them when i was uh still burning cds and shit  i took use your illusion one or two and i made my own album made my own album oh you took the tracks  you like yeah like yesterday yeah but you know what the both of them together dust and bones i liked  they're all really good songs i got a few songs that aren't that good that has been on my list  to get that shit no you're absolutely right but that's the point bill's making it was too much  material to kind of like digest that does happen look at a minute i did a cover that paul mccartney

[03:33:30]  strongest double albums of all time i'm not shitting on it but i'm just saying it gets a  little uh let me see what what were you in uh in the light is a great song that's a great song  this is side three so keep going then bronier or however you say it down by the seaside was a great  song 10 years gone come on i told you those are all good but now we're on side four all right  here we go uh night flight boogie with stew is horrific boogie with stew but before that was  the wonton song wanton song's great that's a good one boogie with stew black country woman i liked a

[03:44:00]  But, you know, I'm just scared.  I want to carry more than the other side.  You know, I'm just scared.  You know. 
[03:44:30]  You know, this is when mommy says that I'm with you and then she doesn't like defend me and say what she said to me on the phone.  What?  Make sure to back me.  Make sure to stand by me.  Why?  Why?  I'm fine.  And no one cares about keeping me calm, by the way. 
[03:45:00]  No one cares enough that much.  It's never about that.  It's about how they feel, about how I feel.  No, it's not about me.  It's never about me.  It's my face, boy.  That is like...  Wow.  Like that when you...  That is sobbing.  Oh, yeah.  Now, I mean, that was... 
[03:45:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Was that a waste of time?  I don't even know what the fuck she was saying.  I think if your listeners can cut that up and...  And do something with it?  I think they can do something with it.  I have total faith in them.  She's fucking...  She's a mess.  You think she's still hot?  I don't think she's still hot.  She's a fucking hot mess.  Really?  No, I don't give a fuck.  No, there's something about her.  Yeah, I think she's hot.  I'm usually not into redheads.  I used to think she was hot.  She got freckles and shit.  I don't like freckles.  I know.  I hate freckles.  I don't like freckles either.  I got a few freckles on me, but when it comes to like a woman, freckles...  Redhead chicks always have that one fucked up tooth. 
[03:46:00]  Anything worse than cleavage, freckles?  You know what I mean?  Like they have that one fang tooth?  I can't defend us.  We're awful.  It's the reason why God is slowly getting rid of us.  There's not many redheads being born these days.  All right.  I think we did it.  It's over.  And that was that.  I watched that the other night, Casino.  And that was that.  Bill, your great Yankee rant?  Uh-huh.  I'm putting that up on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  I thought it would be up by now. 
[03:46:30]  I think it's taken a while to load, but go there and load up.  No, that was nothing but congratulations.  Dude, it was a great rant, and we have to share it with the world, so...  If you missed it, Bill Burr just had a great Yankees rant, an amazing rant.  That's how you started your appearance today, and it was like...  I was...  It came from the heart.  It was fucking great.  It was total congratulations.  I wasn't angry.  Where's Sam?  Is it up there yet?  That's what people expected me to do, Bobby. 
[03:47:00]  When they expect you to do something, if you push one more of those fucking buttons...  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  I'm just setting them up.  These buttons are great.  I like this, too.  Jesus, Bobby.  Bobby is...  He's a fucking...  He's a monkey.  Look at him.  Oh, you like that.  Don't you, faggot.  Why the same one, Ollie?  Over and over, like Danny was saying.  I don't know.  There's not too many buttons.  How about this?  Not too many buttons.  Let me...  Let the record show that there's 50 in front of Bobby. 
[03:47:30]  There's 50 buttons?  Why do you always get to be fucking confrontational?  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  And then there's 10 sets, so you have about 500 buttons.  What's next?  That's what I do.  That's what I do, yeah.  You want to go at it?  Yeah, what do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Yeah, well, check this out.  Yeah?  Fucking...  Boom!  I got you again.  Oh, shit.  That kind of ends it.  How's that, you motherfucker?  All right, well, let's fuck it.  Now, take this.  Nope. 
[03:48:00]  All right, all right, we get it.  I got...  I got this for you.  I hate you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, I got one for you.  Boring!  Yeah, I got one for you.  How's this one right here, you fucking...  Yeah, what the fuck you got?  Hang on, I'm selecting shit.  Yeah, what do you got?  I got this.  What do you fucking got?  I got this right here.  Oh, ah!  Oh, wow, that was really impressive. 
[03:48:30]  That was fucking impressive.  Let me...  Just walk away.  All right, wait a minute.  Let me see what I got over here.  Why not?  Oh, I got one for you.  Yeah, I'll take that.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun.  And what do you got?  Take that.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We're going to be okay.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  You want to go down that road?  She was very bad, he raped, you see? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, you're going that way?  I go this way.  He's a fig.  That's what I got for you, motherfucker.  You go that way?  I go fucking this way.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  That's true.  Bill Burr at Town Hall.  Friday night.  Bill just...  Single tickets.  Still available.  Bill just sees the audience just going to another channel.  He wants to get the plug in before the hall goes.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to end with Club Soda Kenny doing Empire State of Mind for everybody, because 
[03:49:30]  this is the hottest song in America.  Where's that rant?  Is it up there?  It's processing.  It's processing.  All right.  Within minutes, if you go to my YouTube channel, OP Radio, you get to hear the Bill Burr fucking  rant that was just amazing about the Yankees winning the World Series.  It shut up Jimmy and Anthony, which made me very happy, Bill.  So I had to deal with them the last week or two.  Well, I knew what people wanted.  They wanted anger.  So it's like, all right, that's what they're expecting.  I'll congratulate them in a cunty way.  Oh, man.  It was perfect.  I was outside fucking laughing by myself.  It was perfect.  Let's look to that shit.  So Bobby and Bill are going to be at the Garden tonight for Dane Cook. 
[03:50:00]  I'm going.  I can't wait.  That's cool.  And then Bill's got his own show at Town Hall tomorrow night.  Town Hall.  Can't believe it.  Because tonight you're going to be at, it's a guest spot, it's called, like 10 or 15 minutes.  So, and what are you promoting, Bobby?  I'm just going, I'm going back on tour with Dane.  So we're going to be out until second week of December.  This week going to Virginia and Austin.  So just go to my website, robertcullerlive.com, and all my shit's up there.  Hey, you know what?  You guys got to, before you play that, you guys, I started watching Ric Flair videos one night at like 3 in the morning on YouTube. 
[03:50:30]  Now, Sam, why don't you grab them?  Sit down.  Okay.  Sit down for a second.  One of the greatest lines, one of the greatest lines I've ever seen.  There's just, there's a video called Ric Flair, woo.  Okay.  Look that one up.  Is that the one they play at the, what, what, the sports arena?  We were just talking about some different, okay.  So this guy, yeah.  Just click on that one.  It was one of the great ones.  Let's be realistic for a minute. 
[03:51:00]  Am I cooking, huh?  Let me take a look at this, huh?  Is this what happened?  It's about his shoes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of charisma.  The most well-known, the best-looking, the best-dressed, custom-made clothes.  Gold around my neck, Rolex watch around my neck.  My shoes cost more than your house.  A Mercedes, a Roll, all the Corvettes, live in the biggest house, on the biggest side  of town, shit airplanes, and I've got a limited set out there, a mile long, where 25 women 
[03:51:30]  just died for me to go, woo.  Nothing better with a guy that has charisma and a speech impediment at the same time.  He is the funniest fucking, like, you know what I love about my shoes cost more than  your house?  Is you look at the shitty production behind it.  You know it was probably true, and I love how you can't see the guy.  It's this purple fucking loafer.  My shoes cost more than your house.  Dude, I was fucking on the ground by myself.  It's so pathetic, and I just started watching all of his shit. 
[03:52:00]  He became one of my...  We fucked it up with him.  All time.  Oh, my God, he's the greatest fucking dude ever.  We had him on the phone, and we decided to franchise the interview, and it was Sam and  E-Rock making believe they were me and Ant.  He's really unhappy.  So now he fucking hates us.  We blew it.  I was there that day.  We fucking blew it.  I live on the...  What was the line that we...  There was something we said that he really hated.  Well, he didn't even know what was going on.  He knew he was getting fucked with, because I started doing bad Anthony impressions that  he was just not into, and...  It was bad. 
[03:52:30]  It was rough.  Oh, my God.  That bummed you out, because I didn't want to do that.  I didn't want to do that.  I really didn't.  I live on the biggest hill and the biggest side of town.  Dude, that guy is the funniest motherfucker ever.  What did he say about 25 dead women?  What did he say?  No, he said, I got a limo a mile long with 25 women in it.  Just wait for me to come in and go, whew.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Do you understand how great a gig that is?  Yeah.  To sit there talking to poor people and tell them how much shit you got?  I mean, how much fucking fun did that guy have?  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[03:53:00]  I hope Dane burns you again tonight.  Do you?  Yeah, I really do.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  I hope you get burnt on the way there.  Oh, that's nice, Bobby.  What were you saying?  Wait a minute, guys.  We all know that we all have tempers here.  Let's not do this.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in her mouth.  I like turtles. 
[03:53:30]  If I can really.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  Yeah, take that.  I don't feel like playing with you.  That's it, man.  Game over, man.  Game over.  No, not the beast.  Not the beast.  Ah!  I love my eyes!  My eyes!  Ah!  Ah!  I win.  That's an attention game.  I win.  I win.  I broke out the Nick Cage, the beast fucking clip.  We haven't played in a while. 
[03:54:00]  Danny loves that.  What is that from?  It's from the Wicker Man.  I've never even seen that movie.  But that is the worst piece of audio I've ever heard.  Dude, Nicolas Cage acting is probably the worst thing I've ever heard.  Wow!  My eyes!  That was Nick Cage.  He's such a great actor.  He won that Oscar, and then all of a sudden he's doing Con Air.  He had all these great movies.  Face Off.  He didn't like him in Face Off.  We're in Ron and Fez time.  That was actually, for what it was, was decent.  I didn't like John Travolta doing him in Face Off.  I thought that was decent.  I thought John actually didn't phone it in. 
[03:54:30]  John.  Poor bald John.  All right, guys.  It was a pleasure.  Fuck him.  He can afford 9,000 toupees.  Have you ever seen the one where he showed up one day with short hair, and the next day  he has long hair?  We're trying to do some radio here.  He and Billy are trying to get something going.  This is riveting.  We're talking about John Travolta's toupees.  And you're dealing with Ron.  Oh, let's go.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're out.  I'm sorry.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Ron and Fez.  One of my favorite shows.  These guys at the garden tonight, and Bill's going to be back tomorrow, right, Bill?  Because Jimmy's in Houston.  I have nothing better to do.  That's awesome.  Because my shoes cost more than your house. 
[03:55:00]  Bring some more videos in we can check out.  Oh, I got some good ones.  I do that podcast, and everybody, they send me some.  The fucking Jet video was classic today.  And the Ric Flair just as good.  Okay.  Did you see the dating montage one we played?  I wanted to be in here for that.  That was really good.  I will replay it tomorrow.  There was one somebody gave me a link to where this guy had, he had an entire website  talking about how, you know, how he wanted to meet his dream girl.  And the guy, he had been like 60 years old, and he was really demanding.  It was just fucking awesome.  Could someone find that and tweet it to one of us? 
[03:55:30]  If anybody listens to my podcast and they remember that one.  Yeah, we'll do that tomorrow, please.  Do we have time to do Kenny?  A little Empire State of Mind?  Not really.  It's kind of long.  All right, yeah.  Fuck it.  We can't fuck around.  I'm sorry, guys.  No, it's fine.  It's not that big of a deal.  Let's just do the show on this.  We'll get it on tomorrow.  Lockers bouncing all over the joint.  Boy, ass was wiggling, too.  Thanks, Bobby.  You know, the end of the show.  Yeah, it is.  You didn't like that?  It is all right. </pre>
