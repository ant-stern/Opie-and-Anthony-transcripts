<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony, suffering from a self-diagnosed case of strep throat and the flu, struggling to speak while detailing his home remedies.  The hosts then launched into a profanity-laced discussion of Alex Rodriguez hitting his 600th home run, analyzing A-Rod's personality and speculating on the timing of his achievement, playing the John Sterling call and commenting on Susan Waldman’s commentary.  This transitioned to a discussion of Brett Favre allegedly sending inappropriate pictures, focusing on the details of the story and their reactions, including a humorous anecdote about a limp penis picture.

The show shifted to a critique of *American Idol* judges, particularly their dislike of Ellen DeGeneres and commentary on Steven Tyler and Joe Perry's relationship.  The conversation then moved to *America's Got Talent*, discussing Chips Cooney's appearance, his act, and Pierce Morgan's critique. A significant portion focused on Prince Poppycock’s performance, his unique act, appearance, and the judges' reactions, with speculation on his sexuality. The segment concluded with a discussion of ArcAttack and a call from Chips Cooney himself, who discussed his *America's Got Talent* experience, his act, and interactions with the judges, including an anecdote about a past baseball tryout with the New York Yankees.

The next segment featured more of Chips Cooney discussing his *America's Got Talent* experience, his opinions on other contestants (Prince Poppycock and Murray), and humorous interactions with Murray. They speculated on the competition winner and discussed the "Fighting Gravity" act.  The conversation veered into viral videos, including one of a man hit by an ice cream truck while dancing, and a fake news report about a destroyed ice sculpture.  Current events briefly touched upon Rudy Giuliani's daughter's shoplifting incident, a grounded flight due to a suspected smoker, Obama's birthday dinner with Oprah, the legalization of gay marriage in California, and the movies *Kick-Ass*, *Piranha 3D*, and *Step Up 3D*.  The hosts heavily critiqued an upcoming Blackberry phone.

The following segment began with a discussion about the excessive 3D effects in *Step Up*,  leading to a discussion of other dance movies (*You Got Served*, *Drumline*, *Bring It On*) and *Dinner for Schmucks*.  The hosts then discussed their personal lives and tastes, including their opinions on reality TV shows like *The Real Housewives* and *Ice Road Truckers*.  Tom Papa joined them in studio, discussing his upcoming performances, recent apartment move, new fatherhood,  a humorous anecdote about his ex-girlfriend running over a bush, and his Twitter presence. A phone call with Ken Green, the subject of the viral ice cream truck video, followed, describing the incident, injuries, and the video’s popularity, promoting his music and band, Optimo 55 South.  The segment ended with a brief discussion about their changing opinions on Barack Obama's politics.

The final segment started with a discussion about Ken Green's song "Jipper," its misspelling online, and the circumstances of its creation.  After Ken's call,  Opie and Anthony discussed Tom Papa’s departure, criticized rapper "P the G’s" music with derogatory terms, and dedicated a significant portion to Basil Marceau, a Tennessee gubernatorial candidate, playing his bizarre campaign video.  A caller from Tennessee suggested Marceau's candidacy was a hoax.  Other topics included a Newsday restaurant review, movie prize selection, a call from a trucker’s wife, *Serbian Film*, Alvin Green's poor communication skills (exemplified by an audio clip), Michael Edwards Jr.'s semen-spraying assaults, and a humorous furniture store commercial.  The show concluded with a previously recorded phone call of a woman throwing feces at a truck window. The broadcast contained frequent use of offensive language, including racial slurs and misogynistic comments.

[00:03:30]  some words because the the worst part was uh and then we'll move the fuck on the worst part is first  of all getting sick in the middle of the goddamn summer that's not fun that should not be legal that  should be that should be illegal yeah much more fun in the winter yeah because in the winter you don't  care you're like almost happy you don't have to go outside you're like i'll i'll camp out in bed for  three or four days and watch some movies or whatever yeah but uh the middle of summer i'm  sitting there looking out the window day after day going get the this is this is insane well at 
[00:04:00]  least it wasn't nice out exactly oh oh no it was though oh literal jim's in there very nice actually  you did some good days now i'm back and it's thunderstorms of course yeah of course the worst  part though was the tickle in the back of the throat and the swallowing of phlegm just all night  long i didn't sleep for two or two two and a half days straight the ping pong ball feeling of gook 
[00:04:30]  that you can't swallow right but little swallows you know what i mean yeah and then if you suffer  from acid reflux like myself oh oh no phlegm is a lot of fun for that fighting holy the phlegm is  fighting like a stomach acid fireballs just coming up in your fucking throat fireballs just shooting  back up at uh back at your throat you ever try mucinex when you get that like when you're like  like that you take a mucinex that actually helps oh doesn't really yeah uh oh i take them when i got  to do uh tv because i always get nervous and clear my throat i have a mucinex somewhere i think i might 
[00:05:00]  have taken it mucinex it sounds terrible hard i love i love how you just have all this shit at  your house and you're like all right i'll try you try combinations i'll try a clarin d today a mucinex  it's like an aids cocktail a bunch of things thrown together so it works i'm not a doctor i'm like all  right i'll try one of these two of these three of these i'll swallow some of this shit who the  the fuck knows but i gotta tell you last night um someone on twitter goes dude anthony and patrice 
[00:05:30]  did a lady gaga bit you gotta check out the gaga yeah whole i fucking haven't laughed that hard in  a long fucking time that was fucking funny man it's on youtube somewhere nailing it i should  should have retweeted it but it's a funny fucking bit i'm sure it'll be part of the countdown this  weekend yeah patrice fucking just totally stepped up de rosa was great that's the only bit i heard  fun man definitely cool yeah that was a good one that was the only one i i heard it's it's hard  to listen to the show when you're not yeah i know it's like you feel like you're missing something 
[00:06:00]  yeah you feel like you're missing something and then it's like if i'm listening to it i'll be like  oh i would have said that yeah you know like oh i miss my opportunity to say this and true i  actually if i hear the show i'll just actually talk to the radio yeah just to pretend i'm with the  guys again oh look i'm here you know what you could do that i have little pictures of you guys up  yeah and to you you feel like you're still doing the show yeah they don't hear your voice out there  but you're you're participating fucking uh a rod congrats to you uh yankee fans i guess uh well 
[00:06:30]  fuck a rod and fuck the yankees 600th uh homer homer uh did that last night slam that slam that  motherfucker but uh it took him long enough well i got a theory yeah i heard your theory and it really  does make sense when you think about who you're dealing with it took a week right  i'm telling you he's such an egomaniac like two weeks i think two weeks yeah two weeks okay i i  think he's such an egomaniac he might have uh decided to take his damn time because he was loving 
[00:07:00]  the over-the-top exposure he was getting every time he was at bat it was an event right for two  fucking weeks right and if you know anything about a rod he loves he's an egotistical ass he's an  asshole yeah i think most yankee fans would either would agree do you think he'd sacrifice like  why not for two weeks of just like you said having an event every time he gets up to bat  or he's a choke artist which you guys have seen over the years right yeah yeah you just choke for 
[00:07:30]  two weeks and uh the ball didn't even go into the stands so no one was able to get that that's  good the yankee people yeah when it went into the black area yeah it went into the uh yeah the black  area no man's land i think that's why the yankees paid him so much i really think that  they want the yankee home run the home run record back in a new york uniform back in new york and  they're thinking that a rod could actually break the all-time home run record he probably can too  well we were figuring out it took him three years to go from 500 to 600 i believe uh they're saying so 
[00:08:00]  only 17 this year it's not it's not impressive no no so he's got at least another three years before  he hits 700 and then it'll be about 38 39 it's gonna start looking a little tougher than it  than it did a few years ago right at the end he should just uh get back on the roids just  fucking start roiding up and smashing those things so that by the time the controversy and people really  onto it and word gets out it's already over something to say about roids man oh my they were 
[00:08:30]  hitting a lot more fucking home runs and now all the pitchers look like fucking geniuses out there  right and meanwhile it's you know roids must give you a great eyesight yeah because you still got to  hit the fucking you've got to make contact because that's the dumb argument people say that they're  like well you still got to hit it doesn't matter how big you are but yeah maybe the roids really give  you like fucking superman vision or you know uh they're they're they're popping them up so you know  they're doing it that way they're popping it up instead of it getting jacked out of the field uh 
[00:09:00]  out of the park you know they're getting these easy outs easy out easy out easy out would you be the  biggest asshole everyone in everyone in do that day ron oh easy easy out were you ever easy out guy uh  yeah i'd been easy out guy i think i might have to admit i was easy out guy softball not too bad baseball  horrible because i was petrified of the ball and and anybody who ever pitched to me knew it so 
[00:09:30]  they'd always give me a little of the old sweet chin music oh nice and all i could think of is that  ball is coming right towards my fucking temple and and i couldn't concentrate on anything and half the  time it wasn't even sweet chin music it was just a normal strike but that's how it looked very scary  well i was i was right there with you man yeah i i used to be really good playing baseball with my  friends pickup games but when it came to little league i sucked because i couldn't step in there  and and fucking be brave enough to swing i had a 12 year olds fastball i had more stand-up strikeouts 
[00:10:00]  just like i could i didn't even swing i was afraid i was just looking at the ball going oh my god please  don't hit me right right that was my first that was the first thing that shouldn't be in your head  the first thing should be all right i'm gonna watch his pitch i'm gonna see if it's good yeah you  know you make that decision what what take the swing what position you play oh right field so was  i i you know i i was i was an athlete growing up but when it came to baseball man i was too scared 
[00:10:30]  to fucking get in the batter's box properly and and just like you i was fucking right field guy  right field right you ever uh did you ever move out of the bottom of the batter's box before the  pitch even got there oh yeah i was step away yeah i was like like i'm getting away thinking i'm gonna  look like a fucking genius if every pitch is inside on me it's like yeah i'm just gonna step  back because uh yeah that's fine my father was a coach he hated when i would do that because i was  scared of the ball too did he just for a while but did he beat you like fucking bad no but he was 
[00:11:00]  he was like the third base like when he would be like the third base coach yeah like the courtship of  any father kid being beaten by the fucking guy that got his head chopped off by a helicopter that was  awesome the mother has to come out there and rescue the kid well she was being an asshole what  a fucking great scene that was inside take his head off you could have killed him did you suffer  from anxiety when you knew you were coming to bat soon yeah i was even that guy like oh my god i'm 
[00:11:30]  oh my god i might have to fucking strike out again yeah if it was like two out and the guy was up  before me i'm just like thinking please strike out so i don't have to go up now yeah no i wasn't  really a a team player i know what's funny about right field kids don't start hitting to right field  until 15 16 you you had a lot of time to yourself out there yeah yeah they really uh every once in a  while there'd be a surprise like liner it's like oh oh here's my drive down the line or whatever you 
[00:12:00]  had to run after but you never got it was also petrifying when that ball would get popped up to  you and it's like a lot of time to think like i bet i missed this one like i had no confidence it  wasn't like all right get under it here here it is it's like oh god i'm gonna miss this and look like  an idiot you ever uh psych yourself out to just start running forward when you see the pop up and  it's way the fuck over you realize oh it wasn't even close oh oh and if you just didn't panic you 
[00:12:30]  you might have had a shot at it back pedal till you fall on your ass looking good looking good out  there i hate to admit that i sucked a little league that was a fucking wimp i remember playing ball against  the wall like we have like a a a square behind you against the wall as a strike zone and marvin schnoll  was pitching a tennis ball to me was he and he was getting dusk out he kept taunting me with strike  out king strike out king and i promptly missed about 80 pitches in a row oh i wanted to fucking 
[00:13:00]  bludgeon him strike out king strike out king and i did strike out in kingly fashion so you don't you  don't think a rod was right field guy growing up and you think he was hitting monster homers oh yeah he  just knew i would love to know how fast uh the average 12 year old throws the ball and literally  why were we so scared what what could it have been seriously 40 miles an hour i just seems like i was  good just seems a little um what would you say scary i don't i didn't even care how fast i bet 
[00:13:30]  you it wasn't even 40 miles an hour that we're scared of yeah it probably wasn't all right well  here's kidding i'm gonna fucking wing that ball here's a rod 600th with uh the john sterling call  wow you guys are big fans of the john sterling oh everyone loves the john sterling  swung on hit in the air the deep center it is high it is far it is gone he's done it  alex rodriguez hits into monument park he becomes the seventh player in major league history to hit 600 
[00:14:00]  home runs he becomes the youngest player in major league baseball history to hit 600 home runs  and abon from a rod and on the two run first inning home run the yankees take a two nothing lead  you know what i know you're mad but it seems like he kind of like tried to downplay it a little bit  uh that's the first time i've ever heard him trying to downplay because it's not about him he still had 
[00:14:30]  to get his catchphrase in there but you hear how it was like it was kind kind of even really i just  heard he couldn't get to it what bothered me is he was he was obviously scripted because he knew when  this home run hit this is what he'd say which is fine but it's like i knew that he was gearing up  for it it was like what do you why does your thing have to be part of the cadence the youngest player  to hit 600 home runs seven players 600 home runs those are important things right  it's not important no it's dreck it stinks so now forever your catchphrase is in the radio call of this 
[00:15:00]  home run yeah yeah it stinks a hundred years from now they'll be going what the  fuck does that mean an a-bomb someone dropped aids on someone what does that mean they'll have no idea  oh i hope someone throws a fucking aids cocktail out the window with like a blood with aids in it  and they called an a-bomb and all of his fucking calls are now offensive  oh fuck and then susan waldman had this to say oh no now the entire team is out here the first one 
[00:15:30]  to hug him is derek jeter followed by nick swisher the whole team is out by the yankee dugout the  sense of relief has got to be overwhelming for alex rodriguez by the way exactly three years to the day  that he hit number 500 off of kyle davies for sanford for from kansas city that there were two men on in  that but john you could just feel a gorilla falling off of that man's shoulders oh my god wow 
[00:16:00]  susan waldman what were you thinking about huh susan waldman god i have so many jokes i know  seems like she might have a two she might have a bit of a fetish there oh my god the yankee dog  out i love hearing her say that again i love how she says this the whole team twice the whole  team is outside gina nick swisher i'm running out of things to say the whole team again what's 
[00:16:30]  some of the money yankee we got yeah uh pasada what are they supposed to do yeah that's if they all  just sat on their hands in the dugout say that hey ass i'll celebrate this yourself this is what  we really think of you the whole team on their feet shut up we know boy that was  really exciting yeah yeah hey good well good for him he uh he's got uh another uh hundred to go  uh to make seven you think he'll do it and that'll take uh four years uh what is he now 35 35 he's 34 
[00:17:00]  i think 34 35 okay 30 turn 35 last week oh he's 35 okay oh just send him a card there trev no i hate  aron all right right on travis right on he's only he only has 17 homers this year uh yeah not  not that impressive this year that's for sure wow so he's way down so he might make 30 35 this  year 35 would be pushing it yeah say 33 homes home runs a year uh he could do that till he's 40 
[00:17:30]  a slugger can hit home runs in this day and age as healthy as he is he's a fucking specimen  so seven more years of even 30 home runs or six more years that's 180 210 let's say depending  this is seven years at 30 years to 210 more that'll make him seven uh what he said he's a  hundred and eight hundred and ten homers he ain't hitting fucking 210 more homers no i don't think  so either i think maybe 180 to break the record in each one what's he need one uh 162 yeah he's 162 
[00:18:00]  short i think he could do it i think so too come on if he stays healthy he doesn't hurt his back or  fucking his arm doesn't get cut off in a mowing accident a little over 30 for the next five years  yeah yeah it'd be 150 he still has a really good shot yeah yeah he's 35 he's the youngest to get  there so why am i just repeating what i just heard oh my god i know the whole the whole the  whole radio show is talking about it oh jim the whole radio show  so you think brett farve is showing his cock yeah what the

[00:25:00]  heterosexual we're not gonna win this argument people are gonna be like what the fuck guys shut  up the fag since pictures that was in honor of prop eight yes uh being uh so overturned do we have  the uh the backstory on brett farve's cock pictures why is this coming out apparently he had sent it to  this girl i'm just kind of perusing the article and i don't know if she threw him under the bus or if  the the the uh website did like she didn't really want to come public with it yeah but how did the  website find out i think she talked about it she saved the pictures so if you're talking to 
[00:25:30]  the website you wanted to get out there you're saving the pictures you talk to website yeah that  could be um you're gonna just talk to a website hoping they're gonna keep it on the qt no no no  i don't know if she works for them or not um no she doesn't work though okay she said she  refused to go on this one yeah well i mean jim's pretty much covering it like she refused to go  public with it the guy even said in the article he was very transparent in what he knew and what  he didn't know he said in the article he's never seen the pictures he's basing all this on what

[00:39:00]  they're just pissed off at each other it seems now like with the rumors that steven tyler was  leaving anyway and i don't understand that because yeah they made each other multi-millionaires like  why would he be mad in the end yeah well who the fuck knows they they seem to always have been a  little uh snippy toward each other yeah all right oh well when you work with someone for a very long  time you know that shit comes up let's be honest with each other what are you talking about 
[00:39:30]  oh oh my god oh wow that's spitting phlegm oh jesus that made me laugh though are you gonna be okay  grandpa well like honestly i mean in the end i will i would never be mad at you i i had a great life  because of you i had a good run we we both made each other a lot of fucking money and they're in that  same position so why are they mad i don't know bands are like that though or is he like tweeting  that he's mad from his fucking ridiculous home you motherfucker where are you going dumb 
[00:40:00]  motherfuckers you think he'll get that gig though uh i i don't know i think he's too i mean we've we've  talked to him a few times and he's been in the studio and everything which one steven tyler i love  steven he's a little too weird though are you team steven tyler or team joe perry um oh as far as  aerosmith goes i could give a shit which one you know comes out triumphant they worked they work  together yeah they work together well but then you know it's the solo shit but if he wants to do uh 
[00:40:30]  american idol and be a judge he's too weird he's like to it is he can never really get his thoughts  together and put him out there without some weird kind of fucking i think shit i think they're having  perry pharrell as a judge oh my god just be like what what is he talking about talking about aliens  and the fucking yeah yeah and a little too weird i think american idol is in deep trouble yeah and 
[00:41:00]  they're just trying to keep the fucking uh the buzz going maybe maybe they're not even considering  steven tyler with a gimmicky uh oh no way wow he looks bad there well steven tyler is pretty old  too at this point he's no kid and ellen degeneres just backs out she knew that she was in way over  ahead is it her backing out or them going wow she really brought no buzz to the show what so  fucking ever oh you think they fucking uh said beat it i'm thinking and then she her excuse is you 
[00:41:30]  know oh i didn't like criticizing people which is you know just well it was a horrible fit from uh  the get-go yeah yeah that's not a place for her especially when you had paul abdul who was just a  fucking disaster i would tune in sometimes just to see how fucked up she was right slurring her words  you are just a beautiful person and and simon's just looking at her like she's 
[00:42:00]  fucking wasted because she is yeah like they needed that kind of that dynamic of of those  those two and then dummy dog hey dog he's the only one left standing oh does he stink  can't be bothered with that show anymore it's a little pitchy yeah i can't be bothered i'm all  about america's got talent i sat behind that guy i heard fucking kenny told me british judge you should  have fucking yelled at him i didn't care he was he was being pleasant to people smack him was he 
[00:42:30]  yeah yeah he was being pleasant to people in person he's a he's a douchebag that didn't  understand uh chips cooney yeah i know i thought of that believe me he didn't understand for the  people that don't watch america's got talent chips cooney's a comic he's been around for  fucking ever he's from jersey jimmy knows him well otto uh otto knows him very well does a lot of gigs  and he does this uh he's a stand-up comic that revolves his act around being a magician this stupid  pierce what's his last name morgan i don't know uh pierce morgan how do you say his fucking name 
[00:43:00]  british cunt um he he looked at chips cooney like he was a real magician i'm like no you stupid idiot  he's a fucking stand-up comic it's dope yeah yeah it's oh god i love i sort of love introducing chips  cooney when i would mc years ago and i used to love bringing him on and saying like this guy has worked  you've always brought him on as a magician you look when you do something different um  um yeah he's been performing for many years he's worked with david copperfield um so please uh uh 
[00:43:30]  just enjoy the magic oh really i would always give him a real intro like that and then they  would just wait for him and he would just start to stink and they would love it he was chips makes me  laugh i think pierce actually said uh you're the worst magician i've ever seen it's like yeah that's  the fucking joke you dope get it don't you get it but uh whatever i love that america's got  talent i hope it helps chips though i mean look he got even though he got knocked off he i hope he uh 
[00:44:00]  noah said about chips cooney i'm maybe i'm going way too inside because if you're not watching the  show this doesn't mean i guess but uh the first couple appearances he was great on the show he ran  out of material sure the last fucking said he had to do for everybody he had nothing left okay  yeah and ran out of steam even howie mandel who was a big fan and really pushing for him was like  oh we should uh we should uh have been some time i was in yesterday talking about i didn't know he  tried out for the yankees who yeah he apparently has a lot of stories really yeah he's been around 
[00:44:30]  for fucking ever man chips is a very did he try out for the yankees as a joke or no he's a ball  player really yeah draw i know he's a drummer i'm very jealous he has a scene in q a with nick  nolte you ever see q a oh no i never saw that one i remember though you talking about there's a scene  in a tranny bar where there's a tranny singing tiptoe through the tulips and chips is the drummer  oh really yeah it's the fucking greatest that's a great scene to be in 
[00:45:00]  right on so that i i the american idol stuff uh you don't want steven tyler  it don't matter i don't watch the show anymore there was a time i watched the show i don't even  know why i was like hooked well i think chris daughtry was the last season i watched i think  at first it was kind of novel and the competition was kind of cool and you'd you know  you'd watch every episode so you knew the people and then it just gets to the point where it's like  yeah this sucks are you a fan of prince poppycock who never mind that's for my america's got talent 
[00:45:30]  fans oh prince poppycock made it to the semifinals last night what is prince poppycock his videos are  all over the youtube yeah the youtube he's a regular guy that works in a machine shop  so he's like a fucking blue collar dude yeah and then at night he dresses up like this flamboyant  over the top has to be gay opera singer with the powder makeup and everything and sings ridiculous 
[00:46:00]  opera and and sharon osborne's a huge fan of prince poppycock like why yeah but why oh my god is that  prince poppycock can you get a uh a prince poppycock youtube video for anthony why why doesn't the english  guy like throw this guy off because it's opera he's like old school he likes all this that guy's an  ass so if jimmy wasn't on the plane i would have said it should have crashed as long as i survived  it could have been and century we've got royalty on the show hey here's prince poppycock

[00:47:00]  metal shop guy in a metal shop just trying to scrape by and sit around is he gay like he doesn't seem gay  when i'm putting on the makeup poppycock starts what it turns into to enter into a world of fantasy and  he seems a little gay in this this new sense of this new sense of classic orange music yeah  and he becomes this thing prince poppycock he looks like um a 1700s uh french man right last time  we saw prince poppycock he wasn't 100 well tonight he's going to be absolutely i want to just i want

[00:59:00]  room i guess that watched you on america's got talent and fucking congratulations my friend uh thank  you i mean we've never met but i've heard about you for uh for many many years and uh i just defended  you because that peers was just a douchebag to you on the show i don't know i don't know if he was  putting on if he's supposed to be like that or i mean how many you know how many hands of poker can  you win uh it's like i don't know i think he's part of the show i could be wrong you think it's more 
[00:59:30]  like he's supposed to be kind of the dickhead judge i think so yeah but he didn't even understand that  you're not a a magician when you first hit the stage and they put you in a magician category by the  way maybe i'm getting way too inside but they put the they put the acts in groups like here's all the  dance groups here's the magicians here's whatever right and they put him in with a bunch of other  magicians it's like no he's a stand-up comic you idiot he's a comic i told him to put me in um  a magician category oh then i'm an idiot i'm sorry because when they i came out i wanted them to think 
[01:00:00]  i was really going to be a magician right and then you're right though he beat me right away jesus  yeah it was you got the rights by the way to the tony bennett song because chips would always use  that uh it's magic which is great right and then you had to use something else when you were doing  tv and i guess they got the rights for you well they got the rights for the tony bennett song  but when i did the dance they couldn't get the rights for that's a stevie wonder tune another star i 
[01:00:30]  guess they couldn't get the rights for that okay why didn't they use the tony bennett on the tv  uh didn't you say that you were having trouble getting rights to it i i talked to you years ago  maybe you're doing a telethon or something and you're saying you had to switch the song  right i was doing i'll tell you what i was doing i was doing the drew carry hbo special from vegas  and they couldn't get the rights okay and they used the same song but somebody else singing it so has it

[01:06:00]  yeah i gotta go do a job it's up in uh connecticut could be a comedy or a bank robbery  i'm a second story man all right man what do i call it uh gig but it was just cool i like when  guys call it a job like you know that's kind of far to go for a job but that's that's like a real  old school way which i like should be show yeah we're gig it's fine job i actually like job though it's  it's just it's a teamsterish chips uh we gotta take uh a break but one last question murray's got 
[01:06:30]  talent who wins it you think i think uh murray's gonna win it really well he that's all he does  and he's sure got a lot of tricks up his sleeve i've seen all those tricks before though i didn't watch  it like uh he's doing a lot of david copperfield old school yeah yeah is he flamboyant with his  delivery uh a lot of arm waving he's he's canadian oh okay so you can't really said i don't know i  don't know if he's flamboyant or just canadian i don't really know what mary yeah he's from vegas 
[01:07:00]  yeah but canada originally i believe but he's living in vegas trying to make his dream come true  and he's getting closer he he had a tiger appear on the show the other night you're what yep tiger  he had a tiger and then the girl that was in the fucking glass box uh you know popped up behind  howie that's like an old david copperfield yes very impressive don't get me wrong anybody what  yeah we weren't supposed to watch anybody they wouldn't let us watch each other oh really yeah 
[01:07:30]  that's why i didn't know yeah we know we weren't i didn't i never saw them do anything except maybe on  a screen for a second sure we weren't supposed to take pictures either of anybody doing any of this  uh yeah i don't think murray wins i think uh the frat guys that have the the where the lights are  all off and it's the tennis balls or i i can't even explain their act that they are going to win  hands down where they're singing oh i don't know hands down they're going to win i don't know those 
[01:08:00]  guys yeah they i can't even explain their act it's fucked up it's sort of blue man group meets  fucking uh uh fucking glow-in-the-dark tennis balls it's crazy i mean uh i i watched it crazy  last night i saw a girl i'm playing the fiddle i don't know where she came from yeah remember  her yeah the fiddler yeah yeah was she a youtube or something no i don't know hey chips come in  and see us soon all right brother yeah i will thank you very much well congratulations you know

[01:09:00]  week yeah i would love to so how do we do this oh fighting gravity thank you eric and virginia at virginia  tech can i see what they do i haven't seen the show more than i get you think the singer's not  gonna win though he's good man which singer yeah yeah yeah oh the poppycat guy prince uh mouthful  of cock i think they had an opera singer win or i don't know they had a standout female opera  singer either win or come really close last year they probably don't want to do that i think it's 
[01:09:30]  going to be this fighting gravity it's it's such a fucked up act i can't even explain it and it's  it's it's so visual so i don't even know if we should show it on the on the radio right now  i told you i saw blue man group and all i thought of was how much anthony would hate it i  fucking hated blue man group i got it i saw with the man group i did oh i went i saw it show i saw  10 years tubes it was i saw it 10 years too late like they have to up fucking date their act or 
[01:10:00]  something okay who was hosted before nick cannon hasselhoff jerry springer oh right oh really  they kicked jerry springer to the curb certainly did this is fighting gravity it's this is i hate the  the audience's looks i i i know and i think it's all like phony beat the audience on the show scary  stuff oh this is oh curtain goes up there they're kind of blue fluorescent 
[01:10:30]  there's the tennis balls i was telling you about yeah yeah the tennis balls oh okay i see  all right they got a good gimmick here you see look like they're running through they look like  they're running in the sky it does also they're like two feet off the ground and kind of running  in place now they're spinning in a circle because they're not really in those suits they're in black 
[01:11:00]  suits behind the fluorescent suit you know how smart anthony is i'm so dumb i wouldn't have thought of  that no you know what they're on sticks and it's very close i think they actually removed the gravity  from the room they're in space what it is the guys are definitely in those suits they got other guys  in black suits that are lifting them up lifting them up yep is that up wow how do they live they must  be strong motherfuckers yeah they're there's a shitload of guys so it looks like these guys are just kind of 
[01:11:30]  floating around on the stage that's pretty good yeah well you gotta do is turn a flashlight on and wreck the  whole this is a vegas act though you can see yeah definitely this in vegas kind of blue man group  so look you'll see all the guys on stage now that they turn the lights on look at all the  fucking guys it takes oh they show you how they do it oh i'm so they probably should have done that  why would you show how they how you do it keep the illusion 
[01:12:00]  holy shit that's fucked up they're not gonna win though and once you've seen it who gives a turkey  yeah wow we saw it there's the monks fuck off that's a gimmick i i'm telling you that singer  is really good maybe even i haven't seen the magician yeah prince poppycock is at least good  though i mean murray what did they show the prestige murray is you've seen that type of magic man  i mean copperfield's doing that and he's having a rough time fucking selling out  you know it's funny that's what this newspaper does it prints poppycocks 
[01:12:30]  that's the second chip of the fucking uh show  what was the first one chips cooney  should have talked to chips as trip  did we did we say impossibly coming call coming in sometime or steve just had him call in okay  no because he just i was surprised they called in yes because steve's like i called chips i left  a message to call in yeah okay and that's what he did yeah yes so we have uh steve to thank for 
[01:13:00]  that uh yeah but no no you you were just i hate when steve goes in the explanation but but no no no  you were just saying that you and it never explains anything just words flying out at a high rate of  speed nothing with no substance you like that fighting gravity that was pretty cool looking yeah the  show's all right man i don't know if i could sit there for an entire vegas show of that of course  you couldn't be fighting i live to be fighting gravity we get it this guy's holding you up 
[01:13:30]  fuck off exactly turn the lights on a bunch of men holding other men yeah who gives a  shit all have rods when the lights come on they really shouldn't have showed how they did it though  that was a mistake because it does remove the the interest yeah the illusion yeah let's say hi to  tim in boston really fast tim hello boys um i just wanted to make a comment about that fighting  gravity group yeah i actually haven't i haven't oh yeah i do anthony all right am i going to be  allowed are you going to make fun of the callers again today oh damn oh he showed me depends on 
[01:14:00]  your call yeah go ahead i love you guys now be good motherfucker you better be good go ahead go ahead  go you're up okay so that fighting gravity group they've been doing that in japan for years if you  go online uh there's a really good one with a couple guys playing ping pong uh but yeah that that  fighting gravity group is nothing new it's oh really just like this call what's the matter fighting 
[01:14:30]  gravity feeling a little uh like you didn't say gravity quite do it huh no he's right no i feel like  you didn't quite pull it off as a caller did you that's actually a good line i'm a dummy that it's  called fighting gravity and bam you know you would absolutely have won a cd or a dvd today from your  fucking phone call we were giving away dvds to yeah i heard about the worst callers and it was one right  after another i didn't hear about that but this guy fucking blew it for himself he put way too much 
[01:15:00]  pressure he really did you put pressure on yourself son well i'm kind of bummed out that this fighting  gravity is not an original act you know how mad my girlfriend got at me one time we were arguing  and i kept telling her she couldn't cut the mustard she oh she must have hated that that's like  that's like saying skill set man cut the mustard you just couldn't cut the mustard i'm gonna use that  one oh they hate it no one can you ever say anything she likes jimmy yeah i gotta go away for a few days

[01:29:30]  maybe i'll do that to your your video equipment a one of a i hate fake videos man this this one is  real though what is this one oh is this one oh let me start one of a kind piece wait can we explain  this one like this sorry it's uh i don't know it's like some kind of tech program some tech tv show i  don't know what network but uh uh this guy's holding like an old a very old like wax cylinder  like an original yeah yeah with like the old phonographs with like what it looks like a horn 
[01:30:00]  coming out of a box and apparently this is like some kind of one of a kind recording it's that it's  an original it's not like a replica there's not many of these in the world and and this guy is is  explaining to the guy what this is he looks like chris kringle the guy old sc  the one in the world and you can see the tracks go this way and um it's really cool because it it  records much more accurately oh shit oh my god um well that does happen every once in a while that 
[01:30:30]  can't be good are you done with that yeah i'm done with that all right apparently we're  we're really humiliating he was gonna say oh fuck and then he goes shit did you see his hands  nervously shaking he's got something valuable in his hands it was a circle it was like a cylinder  like a toilet paper roll it was a record right yeah that's how they used to do it wow old school 
[01:31:00]  it's hard to get that right a dummy yeah i'd love to buy him another one and then break it in his hand  with a bat or make him hold it in the street and run it over with my car and make his hand and the  thing one and now you're melded with it fuck like fucking brundle recording in brundle record  yes the edison wow yeah thomas edison uh came up with that shit did he invent the record yeah he  invented that cylinder thingy wow djs would hate that though sugar sugar sugar trying to trying to 
[01:31:30]  fucking sugar sugar scratch on on a little wax cylinder like the golden child yeah yeah i want the knife  all right that ice sculpture video and then the woman's laughing out off to the side yeah what do  you don't don't it it really makes me feel bad for people sometimes that you would buy into that they buy  into some of these videos as if it's real it's so fucking fake 
[01:32:00]  ugh i like when people see videos that are obviously real and think they're fake like  oh that too yeah guy falling like that's fake it fell it's not fake what is that how is that fake  his leg is off i gotta call you out of that who says that to you no but i'm just saying like oh  there are comments where it's like totally fake yeah like well those guys are just being douchebags  you'll see like uh for the sake of it you don't go to blood shows but there's some good ones on  there i can't uh come on you never seen a man burned alive in the street for being a child blesser i 
[01:32:30]  don't know why you do that to yourself i know it happens and i'm glad that it's people like that but  it's the worst footage ever oh yeah i can't ever that's my line people ask i can't do it can't do it  i'll look at any kind of sex on fucking video but uh the violence stuff oh no hey after the break  we got a semen thrower what oh right great story and semen's basil marceau is back with another  campaign ad we talked about him on red eye last night did you yes we did cool he's getting on tv 
[01:33:00]  exposure yeah he certainly is because he's wacky remember we played the basil here from way before  anyone else and a lot of people thought that was fake and interviewed oh you thought it was fake  it first jimmy i did i still think there's something to it there's something going on yes  don't know what it is he's being i think he's slightly off and people are putting him up to  it he doesn't understand the retard i think so kind of like gold's way of making that movie  i think this i wouldn't be surprised if some dumb documentary came out about how easily people are 
[01:33:30]  they're probably trying to do some fucking chauncey gardner thing like fucking being there with peter  sellers there's something weird about that they're taking this schlub yeah and trying to do a  documentary about him it wouldn't surprise me oh i could be wrong it's a total guess some guy  that's completely like that would be cool though not not right and not qualified yeah but look at how  fast the news picks it up or how fast people jump on him and he got some votes or whatever you know  yeah maybe it's nothing it's a story of obama  see unqualified and uh whatever 
[01:34:00]  yo anthony's gotta always fucking say shut up happy birthday to obama how old 49 jesus  really 49 yeah obama i wonder what he did for his birthday he probably dropped a bunch of friends  said sat home alone no sat home alone because his wife is in spain his wife and uh one of the  daughters is in spain yeah what about the other daughter why didn't he hang out with her i don't  know have a cigar he doesn't like her that's true but that'd be funny if he came out and just said  that him and his 12 year old daughter like hate each other they just fight all the time yeah 
[01:34:30]  yeah well rudy's daughter did that she supported uh obama in the campaign yep she's kind of a  a shithead oh yeah a birthday dinner with oprah let's get into the rudy thing next because both  those kids don't like rudy i would love to know what uh he did to them he had a birthday dinner with  a private birthday dinner wednesday night with oprah oh my god they must have just been laughing  at white people do you think they were just sitting there going oprah's just like i you know 
[01:35:00]  how rich i am and what i run and how much money i fucking make and that and and obama's like i'm  fucking president bitch you think i'm fucking but they must have just been laughing at white people  you think obama took a taste because no one's looking and oprah said what the hell no one's looking  oh god i don't think that's obama's uh oprah's cup of tea would you go in for a taste with oprah  never why not in anyone's wildest most powerful woman in the world would you go in for a taste 
[01:35:30]  yeah no i'm sure she'd like me to on the very exclusive guest list was miss winfrey joined by  gail king her good friend oh shit and editor at large are they starting to are they starting to  write good friend in a different font lately no good friend like or with quotations lol after it  are they dressing up the good friend in these articles because that that's that's some hinting  going on right so she gets invited to go to dinner with obama for his birthday and she takes her good 
[01:36:00]  friend along with her well why wouldn't you take her man could you do what is her problem with just  coming out if she is i think she is and i would love to see her come out if she is it was like rosie  when she came out it was like good you came out cool i i resented her for it because i i just didn't  like the the fact that she didn't do it on her show like she did when there was nothing yeah ellen  did it while the show was on yeah ellen fucking i mean maybe it's hard i don't know it's easy to  say that yes it's very difficult but i mean like when you're worried about losing your audience or 
[01:36:30]  whatever like when wanda came out i mean i knew about wanda for years because i would see her at the  cellar and she would always have an assistant with her making out with her but no but you just knew  but oprah might be in that other category too what category is that no interest oh maybe make  asexual kind of not wanting anything there might be a no interest thing maybe going on there but  then why hang around with the good friend the good friend all the time in the big font good friend  maybe in the old school font oh my god fuck instead of saying good friend why don't you 
[01:37:00]  fucking write what you really want to write there yeah whoever wrote good that's probably as close as  they could they probably went what do we write it just put it as good kind of looks like girlfriend if you  read it fast good for yeah girl good yeah why do you have to put that relationship at all why not  put with with gail king or friend gail king or whatever you know right good friend friend saying  good friend that's someone that is dying exactly it's like when your aunt has a roommate oh it's a good  friend did you have an aunt with a roommate of course i did her good friend would always come to christmas 
[01:37:30]  dinner did your mom preface it by saying good friend you shoot oh yeah it's you like oh they're just  friends well they must be very close on the holidays especially when we were growing up that  shit you didn't talk about right so you had to keep it as no they're just friends yes did you know  oh god yeah of course dude i've been a sex addict my whole life i knew there was box lapping going on  i would point at them and yell you're gonna burn in hell for that no i didn't care you just knew  you know whatever it was accepted right everyone has gay people in the family it's like you're 
[01:38:00]  fucking you know whatever there was a yeah there was a gay guy in our family um and this is but way  back uh his his name was anthony not not me but his name was anthony and we'd go over into the city  uh on christmas and have the big family get together and there was anthony uh being shunned by all the  fucking gavon uh italian men of the family just looking at him like he's a little fucking light in the 
[01:38:30]  loaf is oh yeah he was an outcast meanwhile they're taking him to the shed when no one's looking  getting their dicks up he's sucking family dick in the shed fucking dick look you motherfucker yeah  it was uh and his mother was just like overbearing nurturing to him it was the textbook textbook  story was he alive of uh i don't know i can't imagine going through the 70s a young gay man and  actually being alive and coming out the other side popping out the other end unscathed stop 
[01:39:00]  i have no idea gays are gonna get married now i think at least they fucking cleared the way for  that in california somebody is actually saying that they want this repealed because it denies  married people their freedom like man and women woman married people it denies them a freedom so  it's unconstitutional how does it deny them freedom it absolutely doesn't and one of the judges said 
[01:39:30]  no it gives it gives freedom to to people but uh some people are just so fucked up with that they  just don't like it and they want to impose their will on other people and that is all it is just say  that with me in some way financially or fucked with me in a way where it actually affected me and my life  without the gayness part of it then i'd be like yeah fuck them i don't need that but if two guys  want to fucking get married and married it doesn't bang their assholes bloody it doesn't matter to me 
[01:40:00]  why do i care why would anyone give a shit this is where the concern religious zealots bug me it's  like you know it's like you're for less government well then mind your fucking business let them suck  each other's dick let them lick pussy suck dick until the cows come home together because cows  are all female lapping each other's cow vaginas while the bulls jerk each other off yum and make  the mer noise and they talk about the sanctity of marriage when most fucking marriages end in 
[01:40:30]  divorce cheating divorce what is it up to 60 or 70 percent it's it's it's a train you know half of  these guys are drilling their wives in the eye with their fists and shit what what the what the  fuck get off you get off your high horse i say exactly get under it like most godless people do  get off your hard horse get under it like most of satan's minions do just these but these  fucking assholes raving about marriage like it's this wonderful thing yeah fuck yourselves not it's 
[01:41:00]  like i just don't understand in this country the idea of telling other people when it comes to something  like that what they can and can't do in their personal lives mind your fucking business how the  government got themselves entrenched in in people's personal lives so much where it's it's this huge  issue the public wants them there though most people are against it it's the same people that are  fucking looking at videos and saying wow this is cool right fake right they're dummies the 
[01:41:30]  fucking country is really full of a lot of dummies yeah we don't have many a lot of smart people  in the country many dummies and uh just the the the thought that you want the government in there  to do things for you is fucked to me it's just fucked up get out of my life and the same arguments  about this are kind of the ones that were made about interracial stuff i like well that i agree with  i don't of course i don't care if it's i don't care if it's offensive to a segment of the population 
[01:42:00]  right i don't give a segment of this room yeah yeah i don't mean that jordan uh puts it perfectly  it is embarrassing that we are even having this debate in this country it's none of your  fucking business yeah if they want to eat each other's asses in holy matrimony exactly oh you may  blow the groom yeah would that just be great it would ruin everything you put the cock ring on him  the the fucking ring bear was a guy with a big glove and a fist 
[01:42:30]  and some crisco and he puts it over the guy's hog and the women they put a veil over her  pussy well the one gets on her knees lifts the veil and licking her fucking box yeah and they  they queef their vows at each other  what if that was the case he would now like to read her own vows  old donkey lips those vaginas old i love when old lesbians get married

[01:48:30]  say bob said that i said no you said bob said hands down it's the best phone on the market and then  bob's like i would never say hands down of course it just got into this big dumb argument over these  two and what they had said to each other hey are we looking at the iphone killer it's bigger no  this is the uh that's the iphone 4 next to the htc evo 4g oh i see right the screen's bigger but 
[01:49:00]  means the whole thing is bigger there's there's a fine line between carrying around something that  fits in your pocket and is the size of a reasonable phone and something that's bigger which all right  great it's a bigger screen but now it's just a little more inconvenient to fucking carry you know  what i want an iphone with verizon that's all i want oh my god why are you yelling because that's  why why do you yell stop making me pick a carrier it's coming out in the christmas time i read this  fucking fall definitely does at&t have photos of fucking jobs with like with donkey shit on his face

[02:01:30]  no that's a new trend that's going to be uh the the fourth one the fourth installment so what step up to  traffic so step up was just a dumb competition in the ghetto step up was uh it was a dance competition  in the dance clubs but you know what the good thing about these movies are that i like the most  they're very diverse yeah see there's white and black and they're getting along and asian and and  asian yeah and hispanic god forbid yes yes yes yes and they're all getting along because they have 
[02:02:00]  this passion for dance well the thing is there is a competition but you have to realize it doesn't  move out i mean they want to win but it's not going to go past dancing no no no no it's but  their dancing is almost like fighting right like they take it that seriously uh are we looking at  love stories too oh yeah yeah that'll be in there interracial yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i love those  movies the girl like oh she can't compete she's not you know one of us one of us she can't do it  and she's all awkward but by the end of the movie boom she's bringing it right yeah yeah yep god 
[02:02:30]  those movies are great getting down low she'll drop it low by the end of the movie oh hells yeah  and then they were step up to the streets right and i was like what is that about we're getting  out of the club out of the club we're gonna just start dancing in the streets right right like street  fucking street style yeah like you know like breaking now it's tough yeah now it's a little  for real a little more yeah for real non-sanctioned yeah yeah dancing and now what are we looking at 
[02:03:00]  with the latest installment step up three step up three d it's like friday the 13th part three whenever  you make the third movie yeah it is always best to do it in 3d so you could put that d behind the  three and make it that much better it's perfect like jaws 3d was made for that probably the best  jaws i think that was made was jaws 3d absolutely agree yeah yeah saw 3d is actually saw part seven  what but it's called it's not following the formula where's the math there it doesn't work 
[02:03:30]  no they're just calling it saw 3d oh but it's part seven how about this just call 7d that would be  great if it was in the seventh dimension because it doesn't matter people wouldn't know what it is  anyway they just think it's that much better they could just put sense to the theater and say  seventh dimension it's smell-o-vision seventh dimension uh-huh you don't know about your step  up movie someone is calling you out on it how about step up ian in salt lake city ian give him  a beating will you all right step up one was about a white kid that lived in the ghetto that was stealing 
[02:04:00]  cars with black guys he got in trouble and had to do community service at some rich school where there  was a girl that did ballet and he showed her how to dance he ended up getting accepted into the school  and going to a competition with that girl they got accepted to some college step up two was about  the little sister that lived with the white kid when he grew up and went to college that she started  getting into the dance scene and it had all kind of changed then they had their little dance-off 
[02:04:30]  competitions in the club so do you wish i had this many details about the plots of step up and you  know up to the street i really think you're right sam was doing a fine job i think you're right  on this describing step up we're just trying to have a little stupid fun with this really not  this guy took is taking a little too seriously big step up fan look at that step up to the  who is that chick though the competition was the thing it wasn't just a dance competition there was  a little bit of story who the a little bit of story to it a lot of people like the dancing scene 
[02:05:00]  right now i mean people like to steal cars too and that's what it was about oh they stole cars too  how about that the movie is about dancing it's not about stealing cars he's just trying to save face  he's watching a dancing movie not a stealing of course it is it's called step up it's not fast  and furious it's step up to the street you think uh there's gonna be some shit going right at you  and with this 3d thing oh yeah i've already i've already seen some of the stuff they're doing these  backflips and their feet coming right off the screen and their fists are pumping right for you 
[02:05:30]  i have seen some uh clips of this on tv and it is the unnecessary 3d 3d nothing worse than the  unnecessary 3d like like old school 3d when you used to wear the the cardboard glasses and and  stuff was uh you know that was unnecessary 3d where they would just reach at you and they knew  they were just making an amusement ride yeah yeah if you want now when you do it's like all right  this is unnecessary we all know what 3d is about it should just be a movie story or the movie and  that's yeah that's all you should worry about it should just be a movie in 3d right so you feel more 
[02:06:00]  immersed in the movie not have these uh like gag effects thrown at you i have friday the 13th  part 3 on dvd but it's not in 3d it's just the movie and like there are these scenes that because  you forget it was in 3d and it's like somebody playing yo-yo and the yo-yo is coming right towards  the camera and you're like why does this have to do with anything or like the spear getting thrown  directly at the lens it really loses its effect without the 3d without 3d sam someone is saying 
[02:06:30]  you got served oh damn no i didn't get served that guy served you oh yeah look the pop locking  right that guy wants to stomp the yard with me i'll do it anytime what the hell does that mean  how about drumline stomp the yard yeah drumline was good drumline what that was i mean that brought  nick cannon to a whole new level that's the drum like battle right between the drummers of a  because nick cannon yeah because they were like you know what you got to follow our rules if you  want to be on our drumline and nick cannon was like i don't think so man let me show you a thing or two 
[02:07:00]  and he did and he did he made the you want to talk about somebody getting served  he made the whole drum line better she a good actor nick cannon he's tremendous  are we still talking about step up no i'm not sure drumline oh okay i thought we were  not sure aren't they all the same movie you got served  this is there any electric boogaloo in this movie you know i think uh  worse bring it on the cheerleader movie is what started this whole wave of contemporary 
[02:07:30]  that that battle of the dancing or whatever blacks whites versus blacks that was bring it on  it was bring it on whites versus blacks that's so good is that nick cannon  that's right nick cannon oh yeah bring it look at that drum line  can we hear it i can't hear the drumming  you can call me d

[02:12:00]  brutal yeah the worst one yet you don't watch the house from nine to eleven uh no i i don't really  watch just a bunch of fucking twats yeah i i guess then they have more money than they know what to  do with yeah i uh oh they just get bitchy and oh it's great let's all check it out tonight you  want to check out the real housewives of washington dc this time around no we just go over somebody's  house we'll all check it out a viewing party no

[02:13:00]  because when you take a digital signal and you run it through analog cables it always looks better  i got the red white and yellow plugged into the tv it's gotta look a little better put ice road  truckers on blu-ray and it looks better you got ice road truckers on blu-ray yeah i got it from the uh  carlisi closet yeah i i have a lot of dvds things that you could just ti-vo for free what's the  worst thing that happens on that show did they almost fall i love that show i can watch that  show the problem is it's almost almost do something it's very other shows they actually 
[02:13:30]  do something it's very bad it really does happen because they're slipping on the ice they're driving  these big trucks and then the ice is cracking a little bit and then the come well those are always  the commercials for it and then the commercial you hear like but look out look out and then it'll be  ice road truckers and you find out the look out look out is like oh hey the lunch truck is here  right look out look out uh can i get a sandwich right i need some hot coffee dramatic they lost  me when there was one where roger or something was driving and he was like they're getting mad to 
[02:14:00]  like watch roger like throw a fit i'm like fuck roger like why do i want to watch roger get mad at  work roger's a dick that's a show watch roger get annoyed at work yes watch roger not be happy  fucking made me so angry i would never watch that show i tried it i was done after one episode  exactly they're driving on the ice so what i didn't i love it but just makes no deadliest catch  man just makes fun of it because they film in the beginning of the season they mock one truck  cracking through the ice and then every episode like four times an episode they go one wrong move 
[02:14:30]  and and they show the exact same truck the same truck every time it only happened once there's nothing  really happening no yeah we never know catch is like fucked up yeah those people can die at any  minute boats listing 20 degrees because it's packed with ice they're out there with axes trying to get  the ice off the boat so it doesn't capsize these guys are driving on ice oh i want to see them do  ice soda truckers i want to see that in like june the fucking june edition there's like a one inch 
[02:15:00]  thin sheen of ice early summer right yeah those little just you're not sure what's gonna happen  the little puddles that are frozen over where the crackly ice just breaks yeah if you roll a marble  over it it falls through that's what i want to see some drowning fat truckers they don't go more than  100 feet every week that's the whole episode but did you ever see like when the trucks break down  and they got to put all their gloves on and stuff because it's so cold no and then they got to open 
[02:15:30]  the hood and that's good they're worried that their brakes freeze and why would i watch that that's  cool but what happens i don't like scraping my windshield what's the worst thing that has  happened since you've seen the show there was a truck that went in a ditch the guy was okay  oh god thank god wow so no trucks disappear no no no the tow truck came and pulled the truck  out of the ditch oh man i mean if they should have one truck just disappear then we'll be watching  how about a truck of babies that falls in the fucking ice jesus we had captain fucking phil die  on on uh deadliest catch yeah he's no ice road trucker phil had a stroke we all have to pee what 
[02:16:00]  are we doing let's go tinkle talking about good shows semen thrower next and basil marceau uh a  brand new campaign ad i want to take sirius xm the virus yeah this is the obedient three show  you're you're psychotic this brings me back we should say uh we should tell everyone tom pop is

[02:19:00]  i know that was very like jury seinfeld but it is true though i just you're eating water  basically you're eating water you get nothing of substance as you're chewing but that's kind of  good because it's you know it's not going to make you fat yeah well a lot of sugar watermelons  a lot of sugar it's not like you're fucking eating the whole goddamn melon you should  have seen patrice before he started eating watermelons 140 put it this way yeah it's better  than cake what it's better to eat for you to eat than cake and cakes or a pop-tart are they doing a

[02:30:30]  no i think he tweets he's like an alien he's an alien on this planet me and aunt met him twice and  the second time we had to remind him that we met before right oh it was great he could give a flying  and that's what i like about the guy i think it was like this is opie and anthony and then he just  looked and went nothing better than the little half squint yeah his head went up ah you see his  teeth yeah it was very embarrassing i reintroduce myself to him every time i see him hi i'm jim

[02:32:30]  bar it's like kind of crowded and i see he's got his budweiser you know he likes to drink and i see  him just kind of like he's kind of swirling a little bit he's starting to make some like laps like  some evil knievel ramp ups you know like going up and then going back and i'm like oh no he's revving  up and he's revving up and all of a sudden he starts walking towards us i'm like oh no  here he comes he's got his beer i got my beer and so he comes up and he he goes listen uh i just gotta 
[02:33:00]  say and i'm looking at him in my eyes i'm saying don't don't and he just leans into jerry which you  don't want to even get you know don't jerry's like like airspace around the white house you just  you just don't do it no a good two mile radius stay outside of that german area but he gets right  and like leans on the table you know and leans right up to his face and goes beer breath for me 
[02:33:30]  just do it for me host the oscars you've got i you've gotta host the oscars do it for me no  and jerry's leaning back like okay and he's like please just for me host the oscars i'm  uncomfortable think about how much you you can't say oscars without spit coming out like normally  and he's like for the oscars and it just spits flying jerry's flailing i'm freezing just listening  to this story and i mean the worst guy you could possibly do this to and so he and he jerry just 
[02:34:00]  doesn't say anything and pete realizes there's no response and just it's quietly says foot for  me and walks away and then jerry just turns to me jerry just turns to me and goes oh he's an idiot  oh he's so brutal he blew it brutal honesty rules though he had him he was in yeah he was a friend 
[02:34:30]  of mine funny comedian that's all he knew oh my god why now he's an idiot why that's brilliant  so humiliating we've all heard the seinfeld stories he's a tough one he's tough he's a tough one i've  never had a bad encounter because i never really talked to him just say hello i very rarely i don't  talk to big comics in the day yeah well chris rock and i was at the table for years i didn't speak  to him and it wasn't i don't like him i think he's brilliant but i mean he was just sitting at the 
[02:35:00]  same table a bunch of people chris would be talking and uh we're all just and it was never a rudeness  like fuck you it wasn't like that but the table's not even four feet you're sitting at the same table  i didn't think he liked me so i was just like all right i kind of respect to that i just never got  a vibe that he wanted to talk to i find him hard to talk to yeah anytime i would try and lob something  up for chris rockens oh you know handball against the drapes someone's got to do the right thing  and film that table yeah i've sat there many times i mean that thing is unbelievable what goes on 
[02:35:30]  it used to be a great reality show i know it used to be more fun when manny was alive yes  what oh yeah the owner man yeah not that fun anymore that's man well that's not as good as  he didn't keep it fun though man no he did though he was intense with his fucking debating skills well  yeah he would if he was on an israel tear holy shit debating about israel palestine you better know  your shit when you wanted to debate him he was obsessed but he was a good bridge in between like 
[02:36:00]  awkward young comics and like chris rock like manny was kind of like good like keeping the balance  introducing the old guys to the new guys yeah yeah yeah but now it's it's still fun but it's  who's ruining it it's not because that's what i hear here it's the lack of people being so much  more fun that means there's some asshole there that's ruining him for everybody it's true no no  is a good guy son's a good guy it's like patrice is not there anymore he doesn't do sets there  no why doesn't he i don't know what does he do 
[02:36:30]  he goes on the road mystery he doesn't really do much city stuff watermelon hunting the uh that  the fucking bob kelly jerry story is is just one of the most the worst thing ever horrid stories i've  ever heard in my life not you not you who would say that to somebody though oh god well i know  jerry seinfeld well jerry just doesn't jerry's just honest he doesn't he doesn't mince it or sugarcoat it  so was hitler very honest about his feelings too just not quite as brutal as jerry welcome to the 
[02:37:00]  new germany yeah not you not you they have not you but the difference hitler didn't hang out  jerry hangs out and does this to people he's the type of person that should be home alone  they control the media who are these people  oh you think we're obsessed with jerry seinfeld jesus no it's just such a famous friend hey tom i 
[02:37:30]  don't know the answer to this and i apologize in advance did you get another season for marriage  ref all right congratulations second season we start producing we start producing we start  going into production next month now who was the uh i know you're not gonna answer the one question  i'll ask it this way who was the coolest celebrity that came on the show that you were surprised was so  cool uh i want to go with the asshole the biggest asshole but i don't think you would you know yeah  answer that who was the coolest celebrity an asshole there were people that didn't do as good as other  people right but there wasn't really no one surprised you were you like wow this person is 
[02:38:00]  even longoria parker really i thought she was just you know desperate housewife pretty dimwit yeah  she was really funny she was like a comic she was really strong alec baldwin was amazing  how great he was just oh the coolest i see him one great comic he was just coming up with full  form the whole show is unscripted right it's just off the top of his head just seeing these things  for the first time he was creating bits like impressive premise and reference was he a stand-up 
[02:38:30]  growing up or anything because he's he's probably one of the funniest guys walking this  fucking earth this guy it's really upsetting i don't think he was a comic i don't know how did it  come about just a funny guy he's funny just funny guys i mean yeah funny guy he never really played  those roles when he was coming up no he was like ricky gervais was another one who was really funny  and he was never a stand-up until now now he does right right yeah now he's famous he's capitalizing  yeah he is a funny guy he is funny it's annoying when you work your whole life as a comic and then 
[02:39:00]  have some guy walk in and be like really funny i'm funnier son of a yeah it hurts fuckers  it hurts doesn't it yeah that pop tart smells good this is you want the other one no i want  the other one no it's good how could you only eat one i'm working i was being generous oh you're  being nice i was being like that shape now i was hoping he wouldn't eat it but tom used to not be  in shape yeah tom when you say he's in shape now that's you don't want to hear that he's not a pig 
[02:39:30]  anymore what was tom's problem he was never brutal he was never like a fatso but he was  tom did you know this that people were talking about no but he knew that he was in great shape  what he had to know you weren't you look better now than you did  wow this is not a compliment it is though  tom's in good shape it is true i am he's in tv shape now it's good he's in tv  yeah he looks like he belongs in tv i'm down to an a cup  how many how much did you lose you look like you lost a good amount uh 10 pounds 
[02:40:00]  no that's all you're talking about 10 pounds that's it maybe it's maybe he's putting muscle  on too though he's probably working out maybe you're just i'm more attractive because i'm on tv  now you're probably right i like your fucking hollywood tan your talent shirts your your olive oil  guinea chum olive oil skin are you happy for tom that he's on the big show on tv i am i like  tom i think he's a good comic yeah really good comic so i'm always happy i see funny people succeed  it's when shitty people succeed that you get bitter and annoyed but when good acts do well it's 
[02:40:30]  it's encouraging right we've been friends for a long time we have i know you about 15 years  maybe more then look him in the eye why why won't you look at me because it's more than friendship  the first time i met jim we were doing a uh we were doing a show in new jersey and uh i mean  very very beginning of maybe it's like 17 18 years ago no i've only been doing it 16 okay so it's about  that and you were uh you were the headliner i believe yeah you must have been the headliner and i was 
[02:41:00]  the middle act and it was like in one of those bad banquet room new jersey awful places like in the  some restaurant somewhere out route 46 or something yeah and i went up and was just bombing i was  supposed to do 20 minutes and i went up and just started bombing and i'd never met you before i don't  think i saw you before we went on stage either and i went up there and i started bombing in front of  all these old people and i just at 10 minutes i just pulled the ripcord i was like good night  everybody and i walk off and i see jim on his way up to the stage he goes i i thought you were doing 
[02:41:30]  20. it's like a bombing dummy but i was scared too i didn't want to have to cover  don't put the extra 10 on me yeah it's a fucking horrible crowd i i remember talking to tom on the  dance floor like we were just i think you had your first wife with you it was like that long ago  it was a long time ago fuck on the dance floor no it was a dance floor in the middle of a restaurant  i just pictured you two like dancing going yeah switching roses in between each other's mouths 
[02:42:00]  like in the sopranos he had on the leather vest i love your shoes what i love your shoes  you really should explain dance floor that was a common dude in the early 90s you're doing a lot of  gigs on dance on parquet dance floors really yeah everyone had the dance floor and uh they would  have the dinner and they would eat their fucking shitty meals and then they would have some comedy  kiev wait you had you had to do your your act on the actual dance floor well yeah it's like any 
[02:42:30]  banquet in the middle of the room no stage yeah oh it's like a banquet hall you know banquet halls  always have like a just a dance yeah that's like we're having a big event and we're gonna have  dancing what else would be fun how about comedian they're fun let's make that that'll be fun  and what do we just give them the mic yeah just in the middle of a dance floor half the people are  facing away because they're at these round banquet tables there's a there's like a mood and an  atmosphere i think you need for for comedy and sometimes i hear these gigs you guys have taken 
[02:43:00]  or my god some people are still taking and it's like yeah why why would you agree to that i know  that money's probably incentive but everything you don't say no to anything you don't say no to  and you just take the gig and deal with it how do you step into like a fucking i've done gigs in  big corporate tents where you know it's just gonna be no one's gonna like you auto was on yesterday  and he told a story about bombing his face off at a yacht club a couple weeks ago 
[02:43:30]  it affected him deeply oh that's awesome big one of those big tents in mom talk yeah with rich people  and yachts and he's you know the fuck you you cunt and just people looking at him with disdain but  that's not a good gig though that's not a good game that's a rough spot right no that's don't give a  shit no i had a rough time in corolla's backyard we did that uh last last year it was a benefit or  something and uh in his backyard yeah it was outdoors it was fucking white plastic lawn chairs oh 
[02:44:00]  oh it was uh no one wants to pay attention i was watching you but i i don't know whoever donated  the chat was like tom hanks's charity of course why would he show up that that's what you're  thinking all day yeah of course i'll get a picture the bosom buddies box set still  pat oswald was on the show i was on the show adam and the leno headliner but he was so smart  because he just did a raffle it was fucking hilarious for like 20 minutes but he was smart  to do his act now he just did a raffle and you put your head down and went with your act yeah it was 
[02:44:30]  okay it wasn't terrible but it was a yard what am i doing yeah you're in a yard i did one in new  york there was a really wealthy indian family brought me in and i just walked into their living  room this beautiful upper east side apartment there's like eight of them no that's an exaggeration  there's probably like 16 maybe 20 of them and they're just sitting there in their rich wow living  room and i just stood in the middle and just before after the marriage ref before okay so that's 
[02:45:00]  like a big corporate gig though and were they good money yeah of course it was really wealthy  and they gave me a lot of dough and i couldn't imagine in their living you get off the elevator  no mike just stand there in the living room they wanted a funny guy at their party is what it was  right the guy that makes everyone laugh yeah you're like make me laugh where's the caught jester  how much time bring in the funny man now i want to laugh  you're in the middle of your act i don't find him amusing anymore how much time um like a set like 
[02:45:30]  a 40 minute holy shit like a half hour 40 minutes yeah but you know what so it was uh i was doing  well the women are beautiful i mean yeah in their in their sorry indian saris and i mean the most  gorgeous women and the guys all look funny you know they have the little mustaches and they're  horrible and it's just horrible men with these wearing pajamas and i couldn't get it out of my head 
[02:46:00]  so i kept coming back to it like no seriously how do you get these women it must be the money and  you know but it's like in this isn't a big show this is me like one yeah it's like me asking you right now  right that's a good question you could ask these guys it is the money so i kept coming back to it  and it got uncomfortable at the end oh really but it went pretty well for standing in someone's living  room it's a rough i did uh red eye last night with an indian actress named uh she's on royal pains 
[02:46:30]  oh i saw her working on your barbecue yeah but she's fucking beautiful really holy  oh wait a minute i've i've seen her yeah yeah what movie was she i don't know if she's in a  movie she's on a show on usa called royal pains i saw like one episode of that show and saw her  she's very fucking pretty really yeah but indian women are beautiful oh they're gorgeous damn look  at that don't they have like a shelf life though i don't know why well a longer shelf shelf life than 
[02:47:00]  white women really yeah because anytime you see like an older indian woman it's kind of  well let's put older indian woman how old are you going anybody really i mean well 30s too old for  him so no wow 30s for me shelf life right you mean like those other like there's like a permanent  woman they put an old indian woman in there let me see what comes up i hope they don't mistake it  with it shows your bar the man she's old gorgeous indian woman it shows your half-finished barbecue all 
[02:47:30]  right all right yeah they see that's what i'm thinking well she's a hundred that's gandhi  everyone that was in the village everyone that was in the village where indy had to go to pankot  palace and bring the stone back with the three stripes but what's that's every old indian woman  that i picture but what's good at that age well like an old white lady's worse than that  really don't you think no when they smiled when their kids came running back with indy they look 
[02:48:00]  terrible oh my god look at that what is she's not pretty she looks like the gypsy from thinner  i'll die with it in my mouth i know the stone was coming back when the woman's teeth were straightening  out but oh but at least they still dress up in those saris and they i mean there's some nice  oh yeah ornamentation fellas weird jewels on them and stuff yeah so they decorate themselves up a  little white ladies yeah they you know i don't know i i i guess it's all relative but i mean it's 
[02:48:30]  all gross you know it's all disgusting after a certain age you're actually 80 year old white  pussy is hot right exactly i'm still trying to figure out what what old pussies talk about that he likes  there's no no i'm just i'm just saying i think like older indian women i think indian women go  bad before a white woman goes bad i think they're half what do you think jimmy i think that to me 
[02:49:00]  after a certain age they're just disasters it's just all garbage it's rare any of them say good  like if you see a 50 year old woman or a 45 year old woman that's really looks like she's 25 that's  rare yeah so it's for anyone black women look young a lot of times then you see black women look  horrible and it's fucking same with anybody else but 45 uh to 50 isn't rough well i mean that's in  my age group now i'm fucking 42 but for for as far as women i want to fuck amscray  get out of here fucking old lady i know it's a bummer that the older you get like the fantasy 
[02:49:30]  of an older woman just keeps going oh it's matronly i know now it's like now it's not older woman it's  just old yeah your older woman fantasy you know that she's got on a fucking a white like  fucking uh a nurse slipper and she smells like shit an oxygen tank part of the fantasy is you  were moving the tube yeah i'm gonna fuck you until you don't have emphysema  fuck a charm bracelet off

[02:59:00]  you don't think he was paying attention it was broad daylight i mean you can't miss a big black  guy with all black but were you trying to get as close to traffic as possible no i was well actually  i was in the lane that was close to us yeah the furthest lane still had traffic but the lane i was  in didn't have any traffic and i swear the guy just came out of nowhere like soon as i looked up i  just heard a small horn and boom are you surprised that it's kind of become the sensation that it 
[02:59:30]  has because everybody loves watching somebody get hit by an ice cream truck  it's surprising because you know you see you see this type of on the internet all day yeah but  what makes your video special it was an ice cream truck if it was a regular truck no one would give a  shit right a regular truck would have made it sad an ice cream truck made it hilarious  right what uh what kind of injuries did you get uh broken ribs uh wow bruised lungs uh fractured ribs 
[03:00:00]  now the ice cream man sells broken ribs right  that's vanilla coated i'm lucky because you know i could it could have been worse i mean i don't know  wow that's you know and then i try to you know i see a lot of people ask me why do you put your hand  down and it was just kind of like an instinct it was kind of like you know i knew i knew i couldn't  stop the guy but it was like you know kind of protecting my body at the same time you know so  yeah yeah yeah yeah of course it would be instinct you're a big fella actually because i mean if i 
[03:00:30]  got hit by an ice cream truck i wouldn't be talking to you today what are you like over 300 pounds or  some no i'm like uh 260 27 somewhere close to that okay but by being a year old you know it's cool  i don't care i laugh about it you know what what now now the ice cream guy stopped did he stop  yeah uh you know the guy didn't have no license or insurance of course not i'll blame him again yeah 
[03:01:00]  i love how you're blaming him it's his fault no license no insurance and no more push-up pops  it's surprising that a man that a grown man that decides to drive an ice cream truck doesn't have  his act together high as a kite yeah probably selling drugs instead of ice cream so he gets out  and is he freaking out or something yeah he was freaking out like oh my god i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't  see you and you know i don't know how he didn't see me but yeah as you can hear in the video he blew the 
[03:01:30]  horn at like the last second and it's like i mean come on dude like what i was just gonna fly out  i was just gonna disappear out the way or what yeah i didn't hear his brakes lock up or anything  yeah he didn't because he wasn't paying attention he couldn't have been you know so  no but once again once again i think the ice cream man's the idiot  once again more importantly if you weren't in traffic dancing  i'm trying to go with it with you here ken but i don't know was there any 
[03:02:00]  you're dancing in traffic right you're a grown man dancing in traffic did the uh did the the  police show up or anything or ambulance yeah the police showed up the ambulance showed up the whole  thing showed up the whole thing showed up and have your friends kind of laughed at you for this  what do you think oh not right away but after we're after we're like okay yeah because it started off as 
[03:02:30]  a joke you know so yeah you know after they say i was okay with it then it was like okay now we can  point and laugh at them you know it really is a great video yeah how come your friend stopped taping  right after like i know he probably went over to help you but why didn't he leave the camera rolling  i don't probably because it was you know it didn't we didn't expect it to come out like that you  know so when i got hit he got the good stuff you know so you know that's all that matters that he  got the good stuff so damn yeah he was as soon as i got hit he was like oh shit and turned the camera 
[03:03:00]  off so wow yeah people you guys are the first radio station that i'm talking to about this so hopefully  there'll be many more oh yeah i i will guarantee ken you'll be on tv by the uh well it's already  thursday you'll be on tv by next week yeah definitely i bet you kimmel calls him because  kimmel does all these cool youtube things it's gonna be kimmel or it's gonna be letterman  yeah and kimmel actually saw the video yesterday i think yesterday oh really yeah he'll definitely 
[03:03:30]  have you on then and then but now you're gonna have to try to top it and dance in front of like  semis and trains planes there's nothing that could be more adorable though i should do a music video  for it huh yeah yeah so what do you do rap artist i do uh i do music man i write music i rap i do it  all man i actually got good music i'm not just one of those guys that's rapping it's like oh what the  hell is this yeah i got good music and it was the song of that i was dancing to in the beginning of 
[03:04:00]  another video if you heard the song it was a small like snippet of it but what's up what's  how's it going where do we find the song the song is on youtube actually and i can email it to you  guys but it's on youtube if you type optimo 55 south that's my band optimo 55 south everything  will pop up where are you based out of ken i missed the beginning right outside chicago oh you  chicago okay you hear gunfire at night oh yeah all the time yeah yeah yeah we wake up in the 
[03:04:30]  morning when you wake up in the morning you smell the wonderful smell of gun smoke that's great that  i just love that love that smell but guns aren't legal in chicago well now they are right well kind  of yeah now they kind of are yeah yeah it's gonna be a little harder to jack people knowing they  might be armed but that's probably why the ice cream man didn't stop he probably thought it was a scam  like no one's gonna dance in the street they want to rob me so he's probably thinking you jump out  of the way right but he's like why they really are dancing in the street yeah so he floored it did he 
[03:05:00]  like in ten green did he try to reduce the swelling with some ice cream sandwiches  yeah you could just see him laying laying fucking fudgicles on him  rubbing bomb pops on his open wounds you're fading out of consciousness and all you hear is  gung gung gung gung gung gung gung gung that would suck god damn man yeah that thing really nails 
[03:05:30]  you oh no that's okay oh well steve uh at foundry music dot com dot com  steve is it steve or steve c i don't know steve steve steve steve steve at foundry music dot com  yeah yeah foundry music yeah f-o-u-n-d-r-y yes we want to play one of your crappy songs right now but  i can't find them on the internet you didn't even hear any of the songs oh i'm sorry i'm sorry

We know how to remix, too, man.  Yeah.  I think you need to sample a little ice cream truck music in there.  That's good.  Why not?  That actually is good.  Thank you.  Fucking Ken Green rules.  Got hit by an ice cream truck, and he's here to tell us all about it. 
[03:10:30]  Jipper with a G.  I should be getting free ice cream sandwiches for life.  Huh?  I should be getting free ice cream sandwiches for life.  You should be.  I would imagine you don't like ice cream.  No, I hate ice cream.  Jipper with a G.  It hurts.  With a G.  Not Jipper.  Not Jipper.  That's Jipper.  He made that up.  That's right.  He made that word.  He made that word.  After his head got slammed into an ice cream truck.  I let him spell it any way he wants.  He got hit by an ice cream truck.  If you want a guy making new words for the English language, it's a guy who's head slammed 
[03:11:00]  by an ice cream truck.  Play some slack.  Well, fuck, Ken.  Enjoy it, because I think you're going to be all over the place the next week or so.  Well, I hope so, man.

I got to go, too.  What?  I got to leave at the same time.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Oh, that's right.  I got to go, too.  I got to go to Tampa.  I'm kidding, of course.  What?  I'm going to see Cowhead today and tomorrow.  Cowhead rules, man. 
[03:12:00]  I'm doing his show today and tomorrow, yeah.  Cowhead.  And, Tom, where are you going?  I have to go do some other AM radio.  Radio thing, no.  Nice.  Which AM show?  I don't know.  I'll tell you if it's a waste of time or not.  I don't know.  Probably is.  Really?  Nah.  They're trying to get me to sell tickets to Caroline's.  Caroline's.  Caroline's.  Can I have a piece of that gum, Jimmy?  Sure, sweetie.  Caroline's.  And you're going to Tampa?  The Improv.  Tonight, tomorrow, Saturday.  Oh, very nice.  I'm looking forward to doing Cowhead show, though.  Yeah, you'll have fun with that.  It's a nice afternoon.  I don't have to do morning press.

Get him some more followers.  He's a good one to follow.  And Caroline's all weekend long.  212-757-4100.  Bye, guys.  You guys rock.  See you a couple days.  See you guys.  All right, gentlemen.  Take care.  They're leaving together, which is a little suspect.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's that about?  Nice.  Who puts it through the hole in the stall?  Which one?  Hey, Greg Charles, does he really have to leave, or was that a fake out?  Oh, hi, Tom. 
[03:13:00]  You know I'd stay.  I'd help you fill those eight hours.  I know.  Yeah, I'd help us fill it.  All right.  Yeah, look at that.  There they go.  He's swell.  Yeah, Tom's cool, man.  He is definitely cool.  I like Tom.  God, that was funny, man.  That fucking, that is funny.  He's excited.  He's very excited.  People are going to know his music now.  He sees this as a way to plug his music.  Was that a good song?  I don't even know.  It sounded, you know, like it sounded current. 
[03:13:30]  I would like to know if that was good or bad.  I have no fucking idea.  I just think it didn't sound like some guy trying to rap and sounding old school or something.  But would you know the difference between bad rap and good rap?  I wouldn't know if that would be accepted in the rap community.  It sounds like any other rap song, but it doesn't sound, but it sounds current.  It sounds like it doesn't suck.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But I have no idea.  Because you know sometimes you listen to someone and you just go, oh, you know it's bad.  Right.  You know when it's bad, but I can't tell if it's good or...  Like P the G? 
[03:14:00]  P the G, yeah.  I love P the G.  It sucks.  All right.  Now that motherfucker...  How do we know?  ...is bad.  How do we know?  Because he's just...  How do we know?  He's off.  He's auto-tuning the shit.  Come on.  She's mad.  I love this one.  Come on.  P the G stinks.  You're sure this is bad, though?  Yes.  This on Positive stinks.  It's bad.  I'm dancing. 
[03:14:30]  She's mad and I know why.  Catchy as hell, though, man.  God.  No, it's not.  She's mad and I know why.  Simply because she's not I.  Not I.  She's not I.  But I'm playing.  I'm playing.  I'm playing.  She laughs and plays.  I'm big dick clap.  I'm big dick clap.  I score a tee and she can't. 
[03:15:00]  I'm playing.  Got nothing, so she wants mine.  For some reason or another,  you sound a little bit.  Hold on, radio.  Hello.  Hello.  Oh, do we need this part?  Oh, God.  This is so bad.  Yeah, this is bad.  You mean good.  No, no.  I mean bad.  He the G is the shit.  He's shit. 
[03:15:30]  But it's stupid video.  Just mad.  Fucking hood rat.  He's just mad.  She mad.  No, you mad.  No, she mad.  You mad because you're not him.  I'm a hater.  He doesn't know how to use the auto-tuner.  He's fucking all off.  The auto-tuner can't even tune his voice.  And it's set to, like, fucking kill.  I think that's a quality song.  It's not even set to stun.  That fucking thing is full blast.  And he's still off key.  That's a quality song right there. 
[03:16:00]  Can we play the latest from Basil Marceau?  Steve from Basio, by the way, had one of the most, the funniest, most racist line I ever heard that I cannot repeat about what he broke when he got hit by that.  I think a few people might have heard it.  Oh, well, good.  I'm glad they did.  Danny heard across the room as you were whispering it to Jimmy.  I think they heard it in radio.  Steve from Basio, I was fucking roaring.  I love how you think whispering, that the mics don't pick up whispering. 
[03:16:30]  And then I hear Danny laughing from across the room.  Like, of course he heard it.  Like there's this four-inch radius around the microphone that if you pass it, then all of a sudden no one can hear anything.  It's just hysterical.  You know what?  Fucking Steve.  I'll tweet the answer right now.  Eh, might as well.  Just in case you didn't hear it.  I'll just tweet the answer.  Oh.  The Steve, uh, Steven S. from Basio answer.  That one took me out of it for a good fucking 30 seconds.  Just took me completely out of it. 
[03:17:00]  Great.  Steve's racism and Martha's tits.  What?  What?  It just takes me out of it.  Someone's saying that shit was pretty decent.  And, uh, they write.  Yeah, P the G is really good.  I'm telling you.  No, not P the G.  And he says an N's opinion.  He wrote it, not me.  Ah.  He uses the, uh, the, you know.  Oh, so he's, uh.  The word.  Oh.  Yeah.  Here's Basil Marceau's latest ad. 
[03:17:30]  Do we have to set up Basil Marceau at this point?  Well, he's a.  I sure hope not.  He's a politician, uh, allegedly.  He's running for office.  Going for, uh, the governorship of Tennessee.  Governor of Tennessee.  He, uh, we played a clip of him.  He didn't sound quite right.  I'll give, I'll give him that.  And I'm, I'm starting to become slightly suspect.  Skeptical of this, uh, the validity of these tapes?  We had him on the phone, though.  Yeah, no, no.  He's out of his fucking mind.  I'm on board.  I think Jim said it, I think.  Uh, that someone, like, this guy's legit.  I think he's legitimately crazy.  But I think someone is, is exploiting him?  Yeah, is presenting him in some way. 
[03:18:00]  So he is the political version of Bobo.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Now I get it.  Yeah, because how is he getting on local TV?  And it's like, well, this video, you'll see, like, is it an equal time thing where they  just have to?  No, they don't have to.  And this video is produced, obviously, but there's little, there's little quirks in it  that obviously could have been taken out, but weren't, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Here's the latest from Basil Marceau.  Hello, citizen.  This is BasilMarceau.com. 
[03:18:30]  I'm your Republican candidate, a governor of Tennessee.  I want you to put me in this building, the Capitol, behind me here, so I can do my issues  and make it all more freer than you were yesterday.  When I'm becoming your governor, I'm going to move the Capitol, the Capitol, the Capitol  of the Tennessee, at the State Building, where Don Sundquist held his temporary office, 
[03:19:00]  so I can clean house and get rid of all the boxed back room politics that ruins our politics  program in Tennessee.  I'll probably take a year or two.  So, once you're all to vote for me, let me clean house.  If you vote for me, I won't take any campaign contributions.  I'd rather lose than take campaign contributions. 
[03:19:30]  So you know I won't be bought and sold.  And your rights will be protected for all eternity, even if I have to write in blood.  And I want you to vote for me.  I'll see you at all at the polls.  I would also plant vegetation on all vacant lots that they take from us when we build roads  and plant and turn it into ethanol and cash it in for gas or money. 
[03:20:00]  Then, I also stop traffic stops, make judges listen to the oath, make the flag fly right,  remove the goldfin's flag from our society.  And once again, I ask you all to vote for me.  Try allegiance to the flag on the day you come to vote.  And pray to my maker, the Lord Jesus Christ, and my savior. 
[03:20:30]  Have a nice day.  Pay to Musso.com  I'm bored with him.  I think he's absolutely...  This is a goof.  Now you think it's a goof?  Somebody is doing this as a goof.  Whether he's in on it or not, I don't know.  But that was too ridiculous.  Well, not only ridiculous, but obviously that video was produced by somebody.  Somebody had that.  Yeah, he wasn't producing that himself and getting his friends to film it. 
[03:21:00]  Putting graphics in and stuff.  So there's little mistakes in there that somebody would have taken out,  and I feel like they were left in on purpose to make the video goofy.  To make it look goofy and wacky.  The sound quality is hysterical.  They don't put a little mic on him.  It's just the camera mic.  So when he's standing close to that wall, you get the echo, and it makes the video goofier.  You know what, though?  Mayor Menino.  Yeah, but...  Mayor Menino talks worse than that. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, but this guy's...  Worse than that.  ...retarded.  Menino's retarded, too.  Believe me.  They have the same kind of cadence in their voices, too, when they're saying stuff.  This guy, I don't...  His issues are hysterical.  I'm bored with him right now.  Why doesn't he...  What is the gold-fringed flag?  He hasn't got a problem with that?  Yeah, I don't know exactly what his problem is with it, but he wants it removed from society.  I'm gonna have to do a little more research on this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's his name.  I mean, it's not like that's a character name or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, we looked him up and found him. 
[03:22:00]  I mean, the guy's legit.  And he's on the ballot.  Yeah.  He's on the fucking ballot.  This is legit, but I have a feeling I think someone's pushing him, sort of, because I just  don't see how...  Do you think the goof factor, he could actually win?  No.  Like, people just going, oh my God, I gotta vote for this guy.  Of course not.  No?  If that was the case, Sarah Palin would have won.  No, because this guy's so fucking, like, goofy.  I don't know.  I don't know what to make of it yet.  Yeah, there's something else going on.  I think it's too goofy to not be done on purpose. 
[03:22:30]  Let's say hi to Tammy in Virginia.  Tammy.  Tammy.  Tammy.  This is from...  Tammy from Kansas City.  I'm sorry, darn.  Oh, Tennessee.  The man, I have not even heard of this man.  I live in Tennessee, and I do believe it is a goof, because he's not even being mentioned  on the TV there in Tennessee, and I believe somebody's actually just making this a big  old goof just for attention.  Well, we talked to the guy.  I mean, he's legit. 
[03:23:00]  He's a little slow, or a little out of it.  You can't fake that.  You can't fake that.  No, I don't think he's acting.  I think someone is just exploiting the fact that this guy is a little off and really wants  to run for office, and they decided to take it to the next level with this whole thing.  Something, yeah.  Very odd.  But we haven't really heard from him.  I mean, I don't even know who this man is.  And, yeah, I know he's a little off, and he does sound goofy talking.  But, I mean, I know I sound goofy, but my goodness, I'm from Tennessee. 
[03:23:30]  But he's just, I don't know if it's real or not, to be honest.  I mean, he just sounds weird.  Retarded?  Yeah.  Yeah, retarded.  Kind of sounds like you.  What's wrong with...  You know, do Arnold Schwarzenegger's retarded?  You know what I'm saying?  Not really.  No, not really.  What?  Not a clue, to tell you the truth.  What the fuck?  But, uh... 
[03:24:00]  Is this still America?  Are we still talking to America?  The very outer edge.  Okay.  The edge of the envelope.  All right, yeah.  Take it easy, lady trucker.  Oh, really?  No, that's what Kev Sleider was saying.  I'm not a lady trucker, but I am a trucker's wife, and I am on the road, so you're right there.  Ah, what a surprise.  Yeah, hey, man.  Yeah, that shocked you, didn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was an experience, wasn't it?  But anyways, we love your show, and I listen every day, folks. 
[03:24:30]  Thank you.  Have we...  Thank you.  This is totally random, and I understand that, but remember the time that lady trucker...  Not the lady trucker, a trucker lady...  Yeah.  ...called and threw poo?  Oh, yes.  Can we find that?  And threw her shit against the fucking...  Have we played that in a while?  ...against the fucking window.  Yeah.  Travis, if you can find it really fast, I don't even know if you can.  The shit...  I don't even know why this came about, but basically, a truck driver, female, shit into 
[03:25:00]  a bag, and then threw it up against the window.  I think it was a guy driving, and it was his girl or wife or something.  I don't remember.  And she was in the passenger seat, and she shit in a bag, a plastic bag, and then you  made her throw it against the window.  I don't know.  So I'm reading more about this Basil Marceau now.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it seems that...  He's on the ballot, a lot of people are saying. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, he's definitely on the ballot.  Okay.  I think what happened was he posted, like, one video, and once that video kind of started  circulating a little bit, apparently some guy named James Crenshaw and some other people  decided that they wanted to be his campaign staff.  Oh, okay.  So it's what I thought.  The guy's for real, and he's got two regular people trying to...  You know, trying to...  They're exploiting him.  Yeah, and it says here that they may be filming a, quote, possible documentary.  Oh, exactly.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now it all makes sense.  Yeah, because that one sucked compared to the first one we saw. 
[03:26:00]  But I could see a documentary of someone following him around as he's, you know, shaking  hands and saying silly stuff.  Well, they were trying too hard in the video.  The guy's a character.  You don't need to set it up with him in front of the Capitol.  And all that crap, right?  Yeah, just fucking let him...  Just fucking film.  Just let him rant.  Let me say hi to Frank on Long Island.  Frank.  Yeah, oh, just a mention.  F.H.  Holly has a mention in today's Newsday.  Are they...  Are they talking about the fact that we turned into a Denver sports bar yet? 
[03:26:30]  No, they just talk about...  Well, not Denver.  San Diego.  Jesus, I don't even know my own bit anymore.  All right.  What do they say in Newsday?  No, I just mentioned a particular recipe that you guys make.  That's all.  Which recipe?  I don't have to tape in front of me.  He just can't take it.  I can't take the calls.  You know, I was trying to prove Ann wrong today, but you got...  Fuck you all.  They just...  I'm with Ann.  It's so rare that they add something. 
[03:27:00]  How do you call a show saying that my brother's restaurant has a nice mention in Newsday, but  you don't know the detail?  You don't know any detail.  You don't have the paper with you.  You just...  That was useless.  You're so right.  Holy shit.  You want to give away DVDs again today?  Yeah, we should.  I don't think we have enough.  Fuck.  Travis, you find that phone call?  I found the date.  I just have to look.  It's not saved as a bit itself.  But I think I might have it on YouTube if you want Danny to play it. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, look at him past the buck.  Nice!  No, I'm actually helping out.  Oh.  Is it a quickie on YouTube?  It's eight minutes.  Oh, we don't want that's quick.  No, we want 28 minutes.  You might have to wait a couple more minutes for me to find it in the actual...  I'm sure I can pull one more sick card.  Well, you know, you really should get your rest, Opie.  Yeah.  Wow.  Who cares about me?  That's weird.  It's just a little...  Just, you know...  It's weird how I care, is it?  Just looking out.  10.02. 
[03:28:00]  You should get a little rest, maybe.  You know, knock off a little early.  If it's 10.45, you'd be like, go fuck your mother.  What do you got?  Blu-rays.  What?  I'm a big Blu-ray fan.  Oh, yeah.  Cop out?  Oh, I need another copy of this.  I gave away mine.  You know why I need the cop out?  Everyone's talking about how fucking Kevin Smith is...  How funny he is with the commentary.  Oh, the commentary.  Kevin's always done great commentary.  And did you...  We didn't talk to Kevin Smith.  He came through here yesterday, I think, right? 
[03:28:30]  Or the day before?  The day before or something like that.  Is he mad that they just made cop out with Will Farrell and fucking Marky Mark?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's very similar to Cop Out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other guys.  The other guys.  The other guys is cop out, isn't it?  Anyone else notice this?  I didn't even think of that, though.  But yeah.  Escape from New York on Blu-ray.  And California with a K.  Did you ever see that with Brad Pitt?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good movie.  Julia Lewis rules.  Yeah.  Early. 
[03:29:00]  I don't think I ever saw...  What am I saying?  I never saw this movie.  Yeah, come on.  I like it.  It's violent.  Here, you could have...  Brad Pitt's pretty fucking nasty in it.  I'm going to keep all three.  Thanks.  Yeah, take the escape from New York.  Thank you, Sam.  I actually figured you'd give them to the callers or...  What?  You just can keep them for yourself?  What?  All right.  Yeah, just fucking give them.  Fuck it.  Okay.  Since we're on movies, real quick.  And you were watching some movie that was like the most shocking thing that you've seen  or whatever.  What was that called? 
[03:29:30]  Not Postal.  Oh, we talked about it, right?  Yeah, last week.  Rampage?  Rampage, right.  I may have one that's better than that.  Really?  It was mentioned to me that this was the most fucked up movie that this person had ever  seen, ever.  So, told D-Boy about it.  He went looking.  He found it.  And then he texted me later that night saying, indeed, this is the most fucked up movie I've  ever watched.  Really?  So, now that D-Boy's on board, I have to check it out.  So, I have it.  No, it's not light up.  I'm going to have to give this one a shot. 
[03:30:00]  What is it?  It's called Serbian Film.  Serbian Film?  Yeah.  And apparently it's about this retired porn star who's trying to make ends meet.  It's a man, a male porn star, not a chick.  And he gets propositioned to make a movie or something, but there's some shenanigans involved  and all you see in the trailer is just, it's subtitled or else I'd play it, but it's just  blood and screaming and murdering.  Fucking and murdering.  Fucking and murdering.  Fucking and sucking.  Well, if D-Boy puts his stamp of approval on it, I'm in.  I heard that, from what I heard, the trailer does not do this film any sort of justice, 
[03:30:30]  so I'm just going to have to sit there and watch it.  I am in.  I have it if you want to copy.  Just because D-Boy said, yeah.  Yeah, I'll bootleg it or you can burn it or something completely illegal that has to  transpire.  That's foreign though, I guess.  Yeah, I know, true.  I got a lot of people that were saying that they did check out Rampage and said it was  fucking cool as shit.  It's such a disturbing, sick fucking movie.  It's on demand.  I might have to check that out. 
[03:31:00]  I like that.  Might have to check that out.  Even better news, Travis has the shit clip.  There it is.  Or we got the FH Riley's plug.  Where do we go?  Where do we go?  Brian and Jones Beach.  Brian?  Yes?  Brian.  If you do a good job, I'm going to take Anne's bit and I'm going to spin it.  Aw, shit.  If this is a good phone call, you will get Escape from New York, the Blu-ray.  But now you're biased because it's an FH Riley's call.  Oh, yeah.  Anne will decide.  But I'll be very open-minded.  What are we looking for in this phone call? 
[03:31:30]  We're looking for poise.  Poise, good.  Someone that's not nervous.  Yeah, we're looking for a lack of nerves.  We're looking for some intelligence.  Pizazz?  A little pizzazz in the call to keep things rolling.  Information.  Little information.  Correct facts.  Something we don't know.  Correct facts.  Okay.  Where we don't feel like we have to go find the paper to see what the fuck this guy's talking about.  It's basically a conversation with somebody over the phone that gives you the information that you're looking for without nerves, without stumbling, babbling, without going off on a wacky tangent. 
[03:32:00]  Okay.  That's all we're looking for and that makes a good call.  And don't add too much.  Don't add too much.  You've got to know when to stop.  You can't go on to another subject.  He should know.  Is he panicking, you think?  I don't know.  All right, Brian.  Go ahead.  Ready and go.  Marvelous meatloaf of F.H. Reilly's at this easygoing gastro pub. 
[03:32:30]  The Grier-capped meatloaf is basted with chili sauce.  There's a word in there he didn't know how to pronounce.  What was that word?  Grier?  Is that proper?  I don't know.  I don't even know what that is.  Yeah, what is that?  Cheese.  Grier.  Grier.  Grier-year.  Grier-ary.  Well.  Scallion whipped potatoes, what's not to like?  Is this Kevin from Connecticut?  No, it's not.  You know what?  You lacked a little pizzazz in there. 
[03:33:00]  I didn't hear much pizzazz.  I heard some reading.  So Newsday's doing a plug because my brother has great meatloaf?  That's what it is.  It's under the heading on the meatloaf.  All right.  I'm going to give you, I'm going to save the Blu-ray Escape from New York, but I will  give you a regular copy of Helen.  You're getting just a regular DVD.  Ashley Judd's latest movie, I think.  Helen. 
[03:33:30]  The back of the box describes her performance as award-worthy.  Worthy.  Not winning.  She didn't win anything.  It says, an engrossing, awards-worthy performance by Ashley Judd.  Congratulations.  You got a copy of Helen.  As an older woman with a 60s hairdo that helps Jimmy Norton.  I used to fucking love Ashley Judd.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she wasn't bad.  Wow, Helen.  Bonus features.  Interviews with Ashley Judd. 
[03:34:00]  Wow.  And three of the other people in the movie.  What's the synopsis?  On the outside, Helen, Ashley Judd, has the perfect life, a loving family, a beautiful  house, and a successful career.  But when her suppressed mental illness resurfaces, the world crumbles around her.  Crippled by depression, Helen befriends Mathilda.  And I said that right.  Mathilda.  A kindred spirit struggling with bipolar disorder.  Together, the two find the solace they have been seeking.  Hey, thanks. 
[03:34:30]  Maybe I could go to Cowlickton with Anthony and shoot it.  All right.  You know what?  I think I might have to upgrade it.  Oh, man.  You might have to give him the upgrade.  Wait.  It did get a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Oh, fuck.  You need to see this.  This looks like a good movie.  We do indeed have some more Escape from New York's and some more Californias.  Unless you want me to go find some other prizes.  You know what?  Well, yeah.  I'm thinking maybe you should look and find some other prizes.  Well, I'm going to give him a twofer, I think. 
[03:35:00]  I'm going to give him the Helen fucking DVD, and I'm going to give him one of the Blu-rays.  What Blu-ray do you want?  I could care less.  Just say F.H.  Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  Care less.  F.H.  Riley in the heart of Huntington Village.  Very good.  400 New York Avenue.  My brother doesn't even need the help, thanks to the fans that made this fucking place rockin'.  And then his food made it even better.  Nice.  Yeah, see, you could get the people in there, but you've got to see them coming back.  Honestly, the listeners of this show allowed us, gave us that chance.  Yes.  They carried F.H. Riley's for the first year or so, and now my brother's reputation is fucking just fucking kicking it out of the foot. 
[03:35:30]  They can't make a fucking phone call, but they are loyal.  Yes.  Yeah.  What do you want?  Cop out California with a K or escape from New York?  Blu-ray action.  Escape from New York.  He gets Escape from New York on Blu-ray.  That's courtesy 20th Century Fox Home Video, Opie.  Yeah.  It is.  It is, Ant.  It is.  And he won't be getting that.  It is.  It is. 
[03:36:00]  It is.  Ah, shit.  Oh, there goes Helen.  Stupid Helen.  Helen.  Oh, more DVDs.  Let me see.  Let me take a look.  We got...  I want to see if I can add to my collection.  Do you want...  Did you want this copy of Helen?  No.  No.  Do you want Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone?  No remorse?  Oh, my God.  Where are these DVDs from?  Wow.  Where the fuck did these come from? 
[03:36:30]  The Carleese, he caused them.  Somebody went to Blockbuster.  Clearance sale time.  And by the way, Tom Selleck reprises his role as Jesse Stone.  Oh, thank God.  I don't know.  So many unanswered questions.  The anguished and relentless former police chief in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts,  while in self-imposed seclusion, following his suspension in nearby Boston, draws Stone  back into the fold.  Wow, there's murders in Boston, and he's got to get back in there.  He's goddamn fucking Jesse Stone. 
[03:37:00]  Look out.  Look out for Jesse Stone.  That's a good movie right there.  You should know that he's done more than two Jesse Stone movies.  Well, how about he stops?  How many Jesse Stone movies?  Jesse Stone No Remorse should not be confused with Jesse Stone Sea Change, Jesse Stone Night  Passage, Jesse Stone Death in Paradise, or Jesse Stone Thin Ice.  How many movies?  That would be five Jesse Stone movies. 
[03:37:30]  Two were made in 2006.  Four of the five are credited as starring Tom Selleck.  Oh, so they got a new Jesse...  I'm guessing, but this one's in the middle.  Right.  Death in Paradise.  Oh, like, he was...  No, oh, no, he just doesn't have top billing.  He is...  What?  How does Jesse Stone not have top billing in Jesse Stone Death in Paradise?  What the fuck is going on with Tom Selleck's career?  I gotta talk to a father here, Andy in Ohio.  Ah, father, she loves the taste of communion wafers. 
[03:38:00]  It was my dad's birthday yesterday.  Oh.  I got him nothing because he's dead.  Yeah, it's the best thing to...  What do you get somebody that has...  Oh, it's just wonderful.  No life.  Year after year, August 4th was a wonderful day.  Phew.  Yep.  Maybe I'll leave him a piece of birthday cake at his gravesite.  Oh, God.  The animals will eat it.  Hope he eats in the middle of the night.  I know it's looking.  Bedelia, where's my cake?  Andy!  I don't want that.  Good morning, boys. 
[03:38:30]  How we doing?  Pretty good, Andy.  Well, I'll try and do the Reader's Digest version of this.  I promised my kids long ago, when they turned 21, I'd take them both to Vegas.  Well, my son turned 21 last November.  Never been laid.  Took him to Vegas.  I'm out there a few days ahead of him.  I'll set up a little something.  I'll see if I can get him laid for his 21st birthday.  Look at you.  I know.  What a nice dad, huh?  Mm-hmm.  The guys think it's cool.  The women think I'm a pig. 
[03:39:00]  I set up an escort to come up to the room.  Birthday morning, we've got to go someplace early, so I'm going to get him up, get him in the shower.  He's going to come out of the shower.  I've got a naked broad laying in bed ready for him.  Well, I got screwed up.  She got by me on the elevator somehow, got up to the room ahead of me.  I go up, and, of course, the boy's sitting there with a shit-eating grin on his face a mile wide.  And I give the girl $150, you know, say, y'all have fun. 
[03:39:30]  I leave.  A few minutes, my phone rings a few minutes later, and my son goes, Dad, she wants more money for more stuff.  I said, well, how much more does she want?  He said, she wants $300.  And I said, what are you getting for your $300 salmon?  He asks, and I hear her in the background go, trust me, he won't be disappointed.  I said, son, I said, have fun.  I said, call me when you're done.  20, 30 minutes goes by.  He calls me. 
[03:40:00]  Of course, being his first time, I figured he'd call five minutes later.  But he calls me about 20 minutes later and says, we're done.  I go up to the room.  They're both sitting there dressed.  I give her the extra $300, and she leaves.  And I'm looking at the boy going, well, how was it?  How was it?  And he's like, oh, it was okay.  I said, you've got to be shitting me.  I said, just okay?  And he says, well, fuck, Dad.  He says, I only got a hand job.  I says, you're shitting me.  For $450, you only got a hand job? 
[03:40:30]  He goes, she wanted $2,000 to get laid.  And I was like, you have got to be kidding me.  I felt like the biggest ass.  I could not believe how much money I spent for a hand job that morning.  Oh, man.  Play the crickets.  Go ahead.  Oh, the sound of silence. 
[03:41:00]  End of story.  Yeah, that was pretty much the end of the story.  Jesus Christ.  I want to apologize to the audience.  I wanted to prove Anthony wrong today, but guess what?  And that actually could have started out as like a story that could have been, all right,  whatever, this, he's getting his son laid, whatever, you know.  You know, but someone is reminding us, Anthony.  Yeah?  Because you beat up the callers yesterday, didn't you? 
[03:41:30]  I did.  It got back to me.  Mark in Montana wants to remind you of something, okay?  All right.  Go ahead, Mark.  Good morning, fellas.  Hello, Mark.  Hi, Mark.  I seem to remember, oh, maybe a year ago, that Anthony called into a radio show and didn't  really make that big of a splash either.  Hey.  Hello, man, Cal.  I was the best caller ever.  But that wasn't the point that day.  But I was a good caller.  He said it was a great call. 
[03:42:00]  You know, you're right.  It was a great call.  But when he's an enemy of the show, that's not what we were looking for.  Obviously.  But, you know, I got a little carried away with the quality of the call instead of the...  One of the greatest Anthony moments ever.  Oh, that's a great call.  Thanks.  I lost focus on what the mission was.  I was like the deep undercover guy that gets caught up in the drug underworld instead  of doing his mission.  Also, you bought in.  I totally bought in.  All right, Mark. 
[03:42:30]  Thank you for that.  I'm glad someone's reminding Anthony of that today.  Yeah.  That's funny.  But it was a good call, damn it.  You know, I'll go with that guy's call.  I know your dad got you abroad, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I told a story about that.  I think that's just weird.  It is weird.  It is, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not good for anything.  Like, I picture my dad and him getting me, like, a hooker.  It's going to be the right type of dad.  That's weird.  And the right father-son type of relationship.  I know there's a bunch of you out there that that happened to, but I don't know, man. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, but it wasn't a hooker or anything either.  And the girl kind of wanted to.  No, I didn't say hooker in your case, but he got you abroad.  No, it wasn't even got me abroad, because she was a friend.  She was always hanging out.  She was always at the house.  I think she wanted to anyway.  Right.  It was kind of one of those things where it was like, oh, yeah.  And I think he just kind of brought it up.  I'm not saying it's cool.  No, no, no.  Not cool, I mean.  No, believe me.  I thought it was great.  I just didn't have that type of relationship with my dad. 
[03:43:30]  That would be so fucking weird.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it would have been weirder if it would have just been, like, some fucking hooker that  came over the house with someone I didn't know.  Like, this was a friend of the family.  She was 19 years old and, you know, whatever.  I let my dad...  Some weird old broad coming over, like Sandy Cain or something.  That would have been traumatic.  I let my dad lick my ex-girlfriend's ass once, but...  Because that's not awkward.  No, that isn't weird.  That's just sharing is caring.  Of course.  She was passed out. 
[03:44:00]  She didn't know the difference.  What the hell?  Come on.  Mom was visiting her sister, you know.  It's like, free meat, pops.  Come on over.  Shit happens.  Now, where do we go?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Let's say hi to Rusty in Manhattan.  Rusty.  Hey, have you guys heard of Alvin Green?  He's running for Senate in South Carolina against Jim DeMint, and the guy cannot speak.  They are trying not to have him run against other people against them, and he's really awful 
[03:44:30]  on the air.  I was wondering if you guys ever played his news clips online.  All right.  His name is Al...  Alvin...  Alvin Green.  Alvin...  Green.  Alvin Green.  Alvin Green.  They thought they were running for Al Green, the singer, and they didn't get him.  They got a guy who can't talk.  Doesn't sound educated, and the Democrats are trying to not have him run.  Yeah, he's an embarrassment or something, I guess.  Very.  I mean, he's probably worse than the guy who just played in Tennessee.  No.  And he's been on the official news program. 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got a clip.  Let's listen to it.  Let me tell you.  If this clip keeps our interest, I'm going to give this guy, Under the Mountain, an epic  journey to save the world.  Who's in that?  Tom Cameron.  I have a Blu-ray.  You don't have to do that.  No, this is a regular movie.  Oh, it's the regular.  Yes, the Mountain.  Yes.  And Sam Neill's.  Oh, Sam Neill from fucking, come on, Jurassic Park. 
[03:45:30]  That's right.  I hope this is the guy.  And hopefully this will be good, and you'll get the DVD.  All right.  Let's go.  We've got two days now, and I'm sure you're asking you, how in the world did something  like this happen?  Where did you come from?  How did you win the nomination for the Democratic Party and the right to face Jim DeMent?  I worked hard.  I got my message to my supporters.  Is it just hard work?  When we say hard work, though, I mean, I understand he didn't hold any campaign functions. 
[03:46:00]  He had no campaign signs, no campaign literature, no website.  How did you work to get the name out?  I mean, what did you physically do?  Well, I did just simple, old-fashioned campaigning.  Nothing fancy or expensive, just...  What is old-fashioned campaigning?  Did you go door-to-door?  Did you get in the bar and drive around the state?  He's a nervous Nelly, but...  I campaigned all across the state.  You know, I had my family and friends help me, you know, and...  You're saying this guy is worse than... 
[03:46:30]  Did you ever have an official function at any point?  The last guy.  Well, the fact is he hasn't come up with anything yet, though.  Or a fundraiser of any sort.  Nothing formal.  No formal.  None of that.  Can you tell me some of the towns that you visited, some of the people that you met with?  Well, I'll just say that I've traveled all across the state, you know, but...  How are you able to travel around the state being unemployed?  I mean, how do you even buy gas?  How do you get gas?  Well, I am still collecting my unemployment benefits, you know. 
[03:47:00]  You are currently collecting unemployment?  Yes, ever since I left the Army nine months ago, up until...  Up until last week, I know.  Well, let me ask you this.  What prompted you to even get involved?  No political background and no volunteer efforts in any kind of campaigns.  Usually folks kind of at least dip their toe in the water.  You just jumped in into maybe one of the biggest races we have in state politics.  Well, I thought about it about two years ago as a soldier serving in Korea, 
[03:47:30]  and I saw the country declining and wanted to do something,  and just the opportunity to just present itself.  There's a lot of speculation.  Uh-oh, and it's not happy.  Stop to tell.  Stop to tell.  I understand what this is all about, where it's going and everything,  and the guy has no experience.  He's not going to answer any questions.  He's nervous.  He doesn't have answers for anything.  Sounds very much like Black Earl, trying to get an answer from Black Earl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's as if Earl was running for office.  No, I'm not feeling this.  This guy isn't wacky enough. 
[03:48:00]  He's not stupid enough.  He doesn't have a kooky enough voice.  Can you play his NACP?  He went to the NACP.  Oh, boy.  Do you think we're going to play another clip?  Desperation in your voice.  You're desperate.  No, no, that's okay.  I thought it was pretty interesting.  No, no, now you're saying you thought it was interesting.  You didn't say that at first.  You said it was funny because he sounds more retarded than the last guy we played.  Basil fucking...  I'm downgrading his DVD, yeah.  Yeah, downgrade his DVD. 
[03:48:30]  Under the Mountain, an epic journey to save the world.  Now we're going to give you cash.  Oh, my God.  But the S is a dollar sign, so that's good.  Yeah.  In the title.  And don't get all excited like we're giving you money.  Get rich or die trying.  What?  On DVD.  DVD, a twist-filled crime thriller, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  That sounds good.  Special features, the making of cash.  So that's really good.  The making of a movie I've never heard of that was direct to fucking video.  So I'm going to give you the DVD copy of cash, sir. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you very much.  You get the number.  All right.  Hold on the line for your DVD.  Oops.  Cash.  Oh, that's a shame.  I think you hit the wrong button.  Holy mother of God.  Yeah.  So we got a guy throwing semen all over the place.  Let's get this story because it's a biggie, and then I think we're going to get the fuck  out of here.  I like the semen throwing story.  Oh, we got this shit hitting the truck window, right?  I didn't forget.  We're going to play that before we leave, too.  But first this.  Michael Edwards Jr. has been charged for a second time with a bizarre crime. 
[03:49:30]  The 28-year-old is accused of spraying women with a plastic bottle of what is believed  to be his own semen inside.  Last week's case in Gaithersburg at a giant store is strikingly similar to one last November  at a Michael's craft store when he allegedly sprayed another woman.  Very similar to the Gaithersburg police case.  He was in a commercial.  Well, there's a rocket scientist.  Very similar to the other fucking case.  Yes, the other semen throwing.  There's a million of these fucking guys out there throwing their semen around. 
[03:50:00]  You're going to get semen on you at semen's.  Semen's, that's right, look at this, a couch for only $9.95, and you could get semen thrown  on you at semen's.  Is this too local?  I think semen's was national, yeah.  Was it national?  Because growing up when I heard those semen commercials, I'm like, you say it's semen.  He was so excited, too.  It was such a Beavis and Butthead thing.  It would start very like low, today only, come to semen's, get a table, couch, and a 
[03:50:30]  chair for only $3,000, today only at semen's.  Semen.  Semen, semen, semen, semen, semen.  I think it was with an I in there, Dan.  Yeah, it was.  S-E-I.  Semen's.  S-I-E.  Well, there's different companies that do semen.  There's semen phones and semen factories.  The rest of the story of the guy throwing his semen.  Establishment, he was targeting females, coming up from behind them, leaving behind a substance. 
[03:51:00]  Montgomery County police still don't know what's motivating the disturbing attacks, but  say he's leaving behind critical DNA evidence.  Now, all local police departments are comparing cases.  We certainly want to still hear from citizens or anyone that thinks they may have had a  similar experience to this.  It's very crucial to have that information passed along.  Obviously, in this case, it was a win for us to be able to charge him additionally. 
[03:51:30]  In both cases, Edwards was charged with second-degree assault.  Now, both times, he posted a $4,000 bond and was released from jail.  And, Brian, tonight, he is free to do it again.  This guy can't help himself.  He's got to throw his semen.  He's got to throw his fucking semen around.  Man, you get away with doing it once, why would you go back and start throwing semen again?  Yeah, they're going to be able to link those together.  At the beginning of the clip, they said that he had squoze his semen onto these women because  he was putting it into a squeeze bottle. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, squeeze bottle.  Like, how much jizz was in there?  Like, he must have been beating off in that bottle for, like, weeks.  No, because he might be like a good drug dealer and he's fucking cutting it a little bit.  Cutting it with some lotion and strudelizing.  Unbelievable loads.  He might be cutting it through his semen.  Yeah, you really can't get a lot of semen out there.  Get it?  Semen.  Semen.  That's just funny.  Those weird...  That's just funny.  Those weird crimes are just funny.  Are women horrified by having semen thrown on them? 
[03:52:30]  They hate it.  I'm sure they're not happy about it, but I don't think they're horrified like their lives  are in danger.  No, I think they're...  I think it's just a nuisance.  No, I think women are completely horrified to the point where, like, they can't sleep,  they can't have relations.  It's almost like a rape.  I would think it's almost like a rape.  To have semen thrown on you?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a very, probably degrading, very psychologically detrimental act to a woman.  Do we throw semen on Iraq?  Yeah.  You think you would allow that? 
[03:53:00]  I wouldn't mind.  For the show, of course.  It's all for the show.  Iraq gets semen thrown all on them.  Here's the commercial that made me giggle as a kid.  I probably wasn't a kid.  I was probably 30.  I've got a hundred of these things.  Exciting Washington's birthday sale ever.  It's Seaman's first.  Right now at all Seaman's showrooms.  Discovered great Washington's birthday values in every Seaman's department.  It's not the guy with the voice, though.  That's different.  Yeah.  The guy with the voice.  Talking about semen.  Now I'm going to pump you full of semen. 
[03:53:30]  Right on this wonderful couch.  You're going to drink my semen.  More laughs from Kevin Smith.  I can't wait to pop this in today.  And I want to talk to Kevin about this fucking Will Ferrell movie.  It's cop out.  Yeah.  That's bullshit.  And someone said on instant feedback that Will Ferrell supposedly turned down the rolling cop out.  And Kevin actually said that in a podcast or something.  Really?  Or a smodcast.  I'm not sure if that's true.  Just throwing it out there. 
[03:54:00]  I did not hear that.  Is there a connection with Will Ferrell and fucking cop out?  No.  That we don't know about?  No.  I don't know.  We'll see.  All right.  We got anything else to do?  Let's see.  Sign the shirts.  Norton at the Improv in Tampa this weekend.  Let's not forget.  Don't forget that.  Yeah.  You got a chance to see Norton in Tampa Bay.  Tampa Bay area.  Yes.  Tom Papa was great today.  The ice cream guy was great today.  Getting hit by the ice cream truck. 
[03:54:30]  Very surprising that that call was actually good and fun and entertaining.  He was fucking cool.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we'll leave you with the shit hitting the window.  Shit hits the window.  The truck window, right?  Yeah.  It's great.  It's a quick 40-second clip, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for checking us out.  Okay.  I'm tying the bag up.
