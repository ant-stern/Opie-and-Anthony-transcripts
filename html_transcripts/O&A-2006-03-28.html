<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion analyzing allegedly suggestive scenes from *Lost in Space*, focusing on Dr. Smith and Will Robinson.  The hosts speculated on Dr. Smith's sexuality and the actor's later career in pornography, punctuating their analysis with exaggerated reactions and comedic interpretations.  This transitioned into a furious and protracted confrontation with Earl, a staff member from the Ron and Fez show.  The conflict stemmed from Ron and Fez staff members allegedly changing the TV channel in Opie and Anthony's office, erasing recordings of the Grammy Awards.  The ensuing argument involved shouting matches, accusations of lying and incompetence, and threats from Opie and Anthony to have listeners monitor their office via webcam.  Earl reportedly broke his phone during the altercation. Opie and Anthony demanded Ron and Fez provide their staff with separate equipment.

The next segment revisited the Earl conflict, detailing an earlier phone call where Earl's frustrated response resulted in a broken phone (and potentially door damage).  The hosts discussed Earl’s historically volatile relationship with Opie, marked by periods of loyalty and estrangement. Listener calls offered varied opinions, some supporting Earl, others Opie and Anthony.  Earl, upset, left the studio, prompting a search by other staff.  The discussion continued, focusing on Earl's alleged evasiveness about his whereabouts the previous night and his behavior (wearing a robe and brushing his teeth in the office).  E-Rock attempted to resolve technical issues stemming from the lost Grammy footage (replaced with Fox News and Spongebob Squarepants). Management intervened, instructing Earl not to touch the equipment.  Earl eventually returned, offering a begrudging apology, and an attempt at reconciliation was made. The segment included audio from various sources, including a song about Earl, Siskel and Ebert outtakes, and general chaotic audio of shouting and running.

The show then featured a rambling, offensive rant about Protestants, followed by a transition to a discussion of Steve Martin's new movie, *Roxanne*.  Steve Martin, the studio guest, arrived visibly upset, complaining about numerous defects in his newly purchased condo.  Anthony detailed problems with his own rental—roof leaks, faulty air conditioning, fallen gutters, a fallen tree, and a massive moth infestation.  Callers shared their own home repair stories and offered suggestions.  The segment also included a word game called "Wordy-gertie" and an impression of a character named "Poe."  A commercial for the "O&A Party Rock" was also aired.

The following segment began with sports updates, followed by a personal finance segment focusing on toilet clogs.  A dispute between Opie and Anthony over sound effects, specifically those involving Sandy Kane, ensued. PJ joined in, resulting in crude language and sexual innuendo.  The hosts then played several listener-submitted "Dickie Goodman" style songs, covering various topics, often using highly offensive language and dark humor.  The hosts discussed Dickie Goodman's suicide.  Discussion then turned to the book "Sinful Nims," and an upcoming interview with its author, followed by more listener-submitted Dickie Goodman songs. The show concluded with audio clips from instructional videos about menstruation for individuals with developmental disabilities (featuring explicit content and sexual innuendo), brief NHL updates, and promotional announcements.  Finally, several instances of an XM channel announcement for a commercial break were interspersed throughout the broadcast.

[00:28:00]  spreading across america  it certainly is  thanks for the help guys  we appreciate it  you guys have been adding a lot to the show lately  making our jobs a lot easier  thank you  thank you  uh and this show is a work in progress  remember yesterday we were talking about  um lost in space  oh dear  and dr smith being a pedophile  you will be molested  where's the other one where it sounds like he's having sex  oh this one  and then we played the lost in space clips 
[00:28:30]  it was very funny  giving examples of uh  him uh being pretty creepy  oh dear  oh dear  and then we uh  someone brought up family guy  how they uh acknowledged that they  they thought that uh dr smith was also a pedophile  yes  well we found the clip from family guy 
[00:29:00]  it's very funny actually  yeah  just a quickie here  and then someone  and then steve just ran in here with the flintstones uh cigarette spot  that we were talking about  cartoons  so like i said this thing's a work in progress always  always wrapping up little storylines every day right  sure  so this is a family guy  talking about lost in space  we need to gather more information about this new planet  don  you take my 16 year old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the rest of the day  penny  you stay here with me  and will  you and the robot go out into the uncharted wilderness  and take this mincing boy hungry pedophile with you 
[00:29:30]  you will be molested  ah yes  god damn  rest in peace dr smith  rest in peace  yeah someone might pay attention to the fact that  uh  major west and and judy were were an item  if it wasn't for the over the top pedophilia that was going on with dr smith and will  yeah  you know because you look and there was  it was  it was john robinson's daughter  judy 
[00:30:00]  and and she's with the guy  how awkward is that  and she was uh  she was a lot younger  yeah  you know  the blonde bombshell kind of uh  thing she had going  you think he might  have been just like a sugar daddy  maybe a sugar daddy  oh boy  yeah because he's kind of you know  older than her  he's a little older than her  derrick is quick in the other room  holy s what's wrong with you  perhaps  are we in a time warp 
[00:30:30]  how did he know there was even a song called sugar daddy  that is creepy  wow that's really good  are we on some kind of weird delay that i don't know about  we found something you do well  yeah  were you just waiting for us to say the word sugar daddy  all three hundred sugar daddy  you made it  remember derrick  it's just a bad song  wow  do you think  do you think uh mrs robinson  uh  it was upset with the fact that  um  don west 
[00:31:00]  was was seeing judy  i'd imagine that a parent wouldn't be happy that their young daughter is seeing an older guy  was penny the mother  and and may just think hey it's a sugar daddy type of thing  but even though maybe maybe major west's intentions were different  not that of a sugar daddy of somebody who actually cared for this younger  yeah maybe the intentions were pure and genuine  yeah but mrs robinson wouldn't see it that way  she'd be butting in and uh  and kind of uh uh giving her opinions even though they're not needed or asked for  and what does uh age mean anyway  right  if you fall in love you fall in love right 
[00:31:30]  yeah sure  yeah  you're into a chick like judy  and uh  i don't know major west  uh what does it matter if major west is a little older  right  why would major west even have to deal  with mrs robinson  i don't know  he's got stuff to do  he's treating her nice it seems  i'm sure major west understands the age difference  right  but he can't help it  he can't change that about himself  he's into the hot blonde uh bombshell  and john robinson isn't getting involved in this whole thing  uh i don't know  no 
[00:32:00]  maybe mrs robinson is unhappy with certain things  and she felt it was more appropriate to take it out on  on major west  maybe  i think mrs robinson  a little too overprotective of judy  who is old enough to make her own decisions  right  would you agree with that opie  it sounds like uh  yeah sure  then again maybe mrs robinson is concerned because  uh major west has a reprehensible reputation  that could possibly be it  but but perhaps that's just  the part that a lot of the people see 
[00:32:30]  but then you know  a lot of the people meaning the entire country and the news media  right  yeah maybe  major west doesn't truly enjoy uh having uh  quiet nights with  with java logs  no  no no major west is never you know hanging out with the uh  i don't know dr smith  of course not  with a java log burning  and a wine bottle  no  watching a uh  could be fun to joke about that on the uh 
[00:33:00]  spaceship but the reality is he's into  you know the hot uh blonde bombshell  so how should major west deal  with mrs robinson  uh being upset with the relationship with judy  i know  maybe uh  maybe uh  major west  should bring uh  his fat breasted other male friend  and say look mrs robinson  at least she's not with him  that's a good idea  i don't know 
[00:33:30]  this storyline will take a while  trust me kids  don't even attempt to figure it out  sounds like uh  sounds like being lost in space  isn't their only problem there  huh  sounds like some  little things going on  oh well  have fun  i'm sure major west would have  drove her home  well where was the uh  you know that little ship  but you can't drive someone home  in a  in a  imaginary car  or spaceship  no 
[00:34:00]  no  you don't keep a spaceship handy  like that  it's not viable  to have another spaceship  with the jupiter 2  right  for long trips or anything  if the spaceship was in the area  i'm sure  he would have had no problem  driving her back home  right  but mrs robinson  sees this maybe  as not caring about judy  right  instead of just  plain logistics  plain logistics  that there just wasn't  a spaceship available  right  exactly  mrs robinson's just being concerned 
[00:34:30]  and that another  means of transportation  made more sense  sounds a little more to me  than just mrs robinson  being concerned for judy's  safety and well-being  possible  major west is a professional guy  seems nice enough  seems like he's treating judy fine  yes  i don't see what her problem is  well the perception of major west  may not be  as  as people who know major west  and know that he's an oddball  but basically a harmless nice guy  yeah  most people might not see that  a lot of people see major west  and just see this 
[00:35:00]  persona  and maybe it takes a while  to get to know major west  and he doesn't look his age  or act his age  right  he doesn't  right  maybe  mrs robinson should  see this part of  major west  that's right  but it doesn't seem to me like  from what i've heard anyway  that she's into this  well she's never seen major west  hanging out by a skateboard stand  all right  or doing other things  that  teenage space boys do  teenage space boys  oh brother 
[00:35:30]  well  give that one time  kids  good luck with that one  major west  yeah good luck  good luck major west  because  we'll see how that plays out for you  that is some crap  you shouldn't have to deal with  when you're out of your 20s  poor major west  yeah  poor major west man  finds himself a judy  that he likes  and has to deal with  mrs robinson  oh  although might i say  that major west's  fat breasted friend  had a similar situation  when he was 28 
[00:36:00]  and he met somebody  of 18  and um  her space parents  were not happy  we've all been through  those situations  yes  you know  because you know  major west  goes for judy  there's got to be  some concern  not just with  mr  john robinson  and mrs robinson  but with uh  some other crew members  maybe  other people that are  just observing  casual observers  might see this as something  that it really isn't  right  they might see  major west as a  sugar daddy  a 
[00:36:30]  sugar daddy  i want him fired  you know  but on the outside  you know  only time  the longer they're lost in space  and hanging out  by taking care of the hydroponic garden  maybe uh  maintaining the chariot  so they could go on  little expeditions  together  the longer they do this together  the more the casual observer  and the rest of the crew 
[00:37:00]  sees  that it is just not a  sugar daddy  chippy thing  that it perhaps  is something a little deeper  more meaningful  and longer lasting  this is a perina  um  uh  cat  chow ad  yeah  and the cat was walking up  to the bowl of food  yeah  and it said  chester  on the side of the  stop it  i swear to god  no wonder you threw your shoe  at the television  i did not  trying to hit that little cat's  television liver  oh one final thing  because it has been confused 
[00:37:30]  a little  for whatever  oj simpson  sitting over there  one other thing  because it has been confused  for whatever reason  yeah  major west  is not married  oh jesus christ  people think  major west is married  yeah  everyone knows  major west is single  he's not married  major west isn't married  doesn't really have any  deep dark secrets  he's not married  major west may have  at some point  had some relationship  on earth  but that was a while ago 
[00:38:00]  and then  on the jupiter 2  since he's been on the  jupiter 2  with judy  what  there's been nobody else  nobody  there's no wife  there's no wife  wow  if only mrs robinson  knew  how when major west  hangs out with his  fat breasted friend  he doesn't do anything  he doesn't try to get  laid at all  so the fat breasted friend  is left alone  while major west  responsibly goes back  to his hotel room  and mellows out  and goes to bed  at least an hour  and then the fat breasted friend 
[00:38:30]  hoping to play  on the star factor  major west  is left to his own devices  on the internet  alright well  here to everyone  on the message board  on the instant feedback  what is that being brought in  there's a long box  those are our new shades  for the windows  oh cool  oh  I think they're sunglasses  alright well  Anthony  some people are very confused  of course  some people are very confused  and they're supposed to be confused 
[00:39:00]  no  my  people  my ship landed  a long time ago  I'm back on earth  resting safely  soundly  and fine  don't worry about me  I am not on the Jupiter 2  I am back at base  have been for many years  and I have no problem  with any of the crew  or any casual observers  or anything  it is not me  that is battling  to get back  to earth  lost in space  trying to navigate  the Jupiter 2  having to deal 
[00:39:30]  with Mrs. Robinson  and I believe  the next rocket ship  to take off  will be the  Martini Steve  oh Jesus  Jupiter 2  that's right  be the first guy  first guy to get  a drunk driving ticket  actually in the atmosphere  in space  I wasn't  Steve  you're weaving  all over the place  take your sweet face  and steal this thing  you big bear of a man  oh dear  lost in Chelsea  let's be honest 
[00:40:00]  Steve would enjoy  a java log  a lot more than I  oh yeah  alright  let's all calm  the F down  I guess his cheek  Steve is the most  hetero guy  ever around  oh really  the signs are all there  he enjoys the  flaming clothing  he enjoys the  bear look  he enjoys the  tats  but I've seen him  you know  I've seen him  like everybody else  enjoy looking at 
[00:40:30]  an attractive woman  sure  I don't understand  where this comes from  I was dating this girl  years ago  and I used to  say things to girls  that gross them out  I used to always ask her  what would you do  if you came downstairs  one time  and me and your dad  were sitting on the couch  whacking each other's backs  you say this to girls  just to annoy her  yeah this one girl  and she would go  that's so disgusting  and I would say  and just as your dad  I was about to finish  he put his face  in my neck  and went  and she said 
[00:41:00]  that was such a graphic  it was so disturbing  to her  and you wonder why  you know  that's very funny  I always talk about  sexually assaulting  the relatives  or whatever girl  that is really funny  we had this  sound man  when our band  used to travel around  our sound man  was this gay guy  we used to call him  Mr. Zenon  who was some company  he worked for  and whenever we'd  get together  without him  in the bus  or anything  we'd talk about  what it must be like  with him having

[00:46:00]  else is at work  here one of the  keys to success  is to make  things happen  in order to do  that you have  to make a lot  of decisions  if you know  what you're doing  you'll make  most of them  correctly  the incorrect  ones to paraphrase  thomas edison  aren't so much  failures as examples  of what doesn't  work  successful people  make lots of  decisions and  while it may seem  that they rarely  change a decision  it's really more  a matter of moving  on and making  the next decision  with new information  write this on a  rock  make lots of 
[00:46:30]  decisions and  trust them to  lead you to  success or  the next decision  this is jim  blasting game  the small business  advocate  i'll see you  on the radio  or on the internet  at smallbusinessadvocate.com  high voltage  is an xl channel  which may include  explicit language  channel blocking  is available by  calling 1-800-XM  radio or  xm canada  at 877-438-9677  the opie and anthony show  hi  this is the worst  of opie and anthony  but it's not bad stuff  no  these are the parts

[00:48:30]  everyone crowded  into that tiny room  to watch the grammys  instead of on the  nice couches  in our big office  with the huge  flat screen  big flat screen  plasma tv  no  it was just like  uh  earl let's ask  straight out  was anybody  from  your staff  in the  opium anthony  office  at any time  last night  um  no  no  no  i mean outside  of  we were working 
[00:49:00]  on a couple  of production  pieces but we  didn't touch the  television  you said you  weren't in the office  wait wait wait wait  wait wait wait  maybe you didn't hear the  question  office working on production  pieces  yeah  maybe you didn't hear the  question  why are they in our office  at all  that's what i asked  earl was anyone in the  office last night  outside of us  no  no  no  earl  earl  was any of your staff  in our office  i'm asking if any of the  staff 
[00:49:30]  was  inside our office  i want a yes  or a no  yes  okay  working  yes  who  you were working on  who was in the office  name everybody  ben come in here  please  who was in the office  earl  yes  who was in the office  well i can't even  well  it was me  uh-huh  and someone we can't name  yet because the paperwork 
[00:50:00]  hasn't been done yet  why  why are you guys in our  office  because we  some of the audio we  can't access we can only  load it  through  your computer  ben  everyone is  completely aware of it  uh-huh  but someone was in the  office  and this is the problem  they changed the channel  and they  fucked us up  bad today  we have no audio  because one of your guys  was changing the channel  there's been emails 
[00:50:30]  and notes posted  everywhere saying  don't fucking change  the channel  the channel  on the big screen tv  cannot be changed  because the remote  not only changes that  it changes every one  of the boxes on there  that are recording  separate channels  and all of a sudden  we have nothing  uh... that we were  recording the night  before  now i've seen  three on three  different occasions  the same emails  go out because  this has happened  before  and  your  your staff  is supposed to be  completely aware 
[00:51:00]  of this  i've gotten emails  where it says  your staff  is completely  aware of this  and yet  again  it happened  what is danny  showing me  danny's got a  some type of evidence  danny what is that  basically i wanted to  see what was going on  on the pc  last night  so i just did a search  for last modified files  and everything that's  coming up is  ron and fez production  between the hours of  eight and eleven  eight and eleven  at night  so not only  was someone in the  office they were in  there from eight o'clock  till eleven o'clock 
[00:51:30]  for three hours  i was working on  eric's computer  we were we were  there pretty late  so you're telling me  that no so so  what they did was  you watched part of  the grammys not all  of them but they  didn't watch them on  the computers and the  tvs in the office  the big flat screen  they ran in to this  little shitty peep booth  and watched them here  next to the studio  that's what we're  supposed to believe  even though you were  in our office for  three straight hours  doing ron and fez  production  you wouldn't  you guys are  fucking lying  you're lying  erl you are lying  now  why would you  watch the grammys 
[00:52:00]  in this tiny little  studio when you  were in our huge  office with a huge  flat screen  for the entire  grammy broadcast  for the entire  what  i will tell you  the segment  that we happened  to catch  i don't give a  shit what  what you watched  of the grammys  the fact is  you watched it  in our office  and someone  changed the channel  on the tv  and they fucked  us bad today  was the channel  changed on the tv  during the time  you were in there  for three hours  um  i don't know  oh god  yes you do  know 
[00:52:30]  just answer  you do know  you know  for the sake  of guilt  yes  who changed  the channel  it was probably  me  now weren't  you told  earl  in three different  times  that that channel  is not to be  changed because  it interferes  with the other  boxes  i fucked up  i'm sorry  you fucked up  what again  this is the  third time  that i can count  and i pay no  attention to what  goes on in this  fucking place  third time  third time 
[00:53:00]  but  this time  if  for the sake  of everything  i did it  well one time  is  earl  one time  is too many  we're a very  popular talk show  that broadcasts  in two fucking  countries  and you're  sitting there  with the remote  fucking us up  we love  Ron and Fez  but you guys  are ridiculous  behind the scenes  you cost us  a lot of  fucking audio  today  how about  you help  the show  and you sing  all the  performances  because we  don't have  them  do your 
[00:53:30]  impression  of Bono  because we  really need  it now  yeah  what did  you see  i don't  care what  you saw  we care  that you  changed  the channel  when people  have told  you don't  change  the channel  because it  fucks up  our  recordings  and then  you denied  it  yeah  and then  you denied  it  said you  watched  in another  office  you lied  and then  i asked  you if  anyone was  in the  office  and your  first  response  to that  was no  and then  it turns  out  we were  working on  production  all night  last night 
[00:54:00]  i don't give  a shit  but when you  were initially  asked you  said no  which was  a lie  you lied  and now  what  irak  you got  something  no we  say we  were in the  office  and you  said no  i just  asked if  anyone  was in  the  office  at all  and at  first  you said  no  right  irak  what do  you got  earl  didn't you  call me  last night  in a panic  around  735  asking  how to  reset  the television  recording  program  on the computer  oh  and did i not  walk you through  it saying  do you see 
[00:54:30]  this do you  see that  are you  watching tv  yes you  were watching  tv is  everything  back online  yes  and what  did i  tell you  i said  is everything  set now  was the  television  set on  the monitor  and why  did he  get in  that  situation  to begin  with  yeah you  knew you  fucked up  then  because  instead of  minimizing it  i hit the  other button  by accident  he disconnected  the actual  pro he turned  the program  off that is  set to record  the television  i walked  through him  with it  and you  told me  everything  was fine  earl you  were in  the office  i'm asking  you to tell  me what  was on the 
[00:55:00]  screen  i'm like  do you  see this  yes  do these  little red  dots  showing up  yes  so you're  watching tv  the program  is back  on  it's  recording  yes  okay i'm  going back  to sleep  i'll talk  to you  later  okay earl  bye  i can't  believe i'm  saying this  today but  i love  erock  erock's full  of piss  and vinegar  come on  erock  come on baby  if it's technical  shit there's no  way eric is  wrong and earl  is right  no way  come on baby  uh than's got  something  than well  it well i think  it even was  fixed because we  have the first  glorious eight 
[00:55:30]  minutes of the  grammys  so it may  have gotten  fixed and then  fucked up eight  minutes later  exactly  so we can  play madonna  you know  trying to look  like farrah  fawcett in  a leotard  that's our  grammy  coverage  so like  so earl may  have actually  fixed it  and then  completely  fucked it  up again  eight minutes  later by  changing the  channel or  something else  yeah  why are these  guys allowed  in our office  that's what i  need to know  i love ron and  fez they do an  unbelievable show 
[00:56:00]  i listen every  day but i gotta  tell you their  people behind the  scenes are  incompetent and  have no business  being in our  office where the  big boys play  get the fucking  guys a little  commodore computer  and and you  know and let  them hang out  somewhere else  you guys don't  deserve to be in  our office  how else  they don't  because it's  shit like this  you do stuff  that you've been  told not to do  with the tv

[01:09:30]  and uh  it looks like he's upset fuzzy  so maybe that's not the uh  exact way to go with this  maybe i don't even want  to hear the story  do i not even want  to hear the story earl  no you don't  it's that bad  no i have nothing  to say about this  uh our intern uh  bronx johnny said to me  uh i've cleaned it all up  so that's  that's as close as i know  yeah because when i was  coming in the studio  uh we have a big window  that leads out into the  that shows into the office way  and as i'm sitting here 
[01:10:00]  i see a giant box  look at you  you've had more energy  from this though  you're like one of those  kids in the family  that loves the drama  dad's drunk  you know that one  that's like  they couldn't be more up  than when the parents  are fighting  one of the teachers  started screaming today  yeah  yeah earl was tossing  a giant box of stuff  right in front of the window  it just went flying  across the room  so that's what  bronx johnny  has cleaned up for us  thank god for bronx johnny  the uh  the middle child 
[01:10:30]  who wants to make sure  everything's gonna be all right  everything's gonna be okay  it might be time for me  to go into my  harper valley pta dance  mom  mom and dad  aren't breaking up  everything's fine  i don't know what happened  earl you tell me  i don't even want to know  i shouldn't even  i shouldn't even look into this  it's like  not even worth discussing on you  yeah  not at all  i and  i'm trying to stay calm 
[01:11:00]  i really am  yeah  well throwing boxes  isn't gonna help that  put an eye out  oh some of those boxes  they have sharp corners  yes that's right  and fez has diabetes  so he needs his eyesight  you should see my phone  and my bathroom door  everything's going crazy  at your house  shit all over it  no i  i think i knocked it off  a team  here's the thing  don't wipe your ass  with your phone  or your bathroom door  wow that shouldn't even  have to be said  hey uh  well it is going to be said 
[01:11:30]  it is going to be said  until everybody understands it  adam you're on run of fez  hey guys  uh  earl i am so disappointed in you  uh  you took a real ass whipping  on there this morning  and did not handle yourself  like a black man at all  you just got flustered  and beat the hell out of your phone  i ain't even afraid of black men  anymore now  all right  well you can't compare earl  with most  and you have to remember  that o and a  and earl  have this  long history  that they go back  a long way  where it's kind of a 
[01:12:00]  i don't want to say  love hate  it's love  and then there's a  taunting and teasing  and something that happens  that sends earl  into the spiral  like a tough love  yeah it could be a tough love  but the tough love  should work  to make the guy tougher  not uh  go into uh  a whole  downward place  well it was a situation  where they kept asking me  questions  and every time i tried  to answer it  one of them would start  screaming at me  so i just got flustered  and i threw the phone 
[01:12:30]  across the hall  and broke it  i didn't break it  the door is another story  yeah  i just got  i was like why am i talking  if they're not gonna let me  get a word in  you know  know your own history  you know this earl  you were any w world  no i mean i just  you know i was running  i just couldn't deal  with it this morning  that's what i  you can never deal with it  that's something that  has gone on  as long as we've known  the three of you guys  that's what i heard  when i walked in  that was the first thing  i heard out of the  ona office  yeah 
[01:13:00]  any w rl is back  who said that  um  i think opie said that  yeah  opie said it  was the first one i heard  then a lot of people  chimed in as well  earl just getting in  your kitchen  it's just not a way  to start a day  i know  and your bathroom  but you know the gimmick  you've been up on the  hill before  refusing to ski  we could go through  every single story  you wouldn't touch  the cotton  it's a long  thing that you have  sounds crazy 
[01:13:30]  when in hindsight  yeah  this is what  this is what it's all  about earl  that's your relationship  here's uh  hollywood  and i have heard  none of it  i have no idea  what started it  or how we got  to this point  other than the fact  that a young intern  had to go picking up  a bunch of boxes  today  and bronx johnny  you couldn't get any  better than that  fezzy  bronx johnny is the  man  he's right there  yeah  he was the  he was the oasis 
[01:14:00]  of calm  were those emma's  boxes  her moving boxes  oh no  that box says  earl across it  oh  like earl's stuff  has been loaded up  for him to leave  the building  oh is that right  that's why that  box got thrown  the details will  trickle in as we  go  i gotta start  listening  i gotta start  listening  i gotta get uh  one of these  satellite radios  i hear everybody  talking about  uh here's uh  jesse jesse  you're on run  a fez  hey jesse  hey how's it 
[01:14:30]  going  yeah  uh earl didn't  deserve that  i thought he  handled himself  very well  this morning  by what  breaking phones  and throwing  boxes  no that was  off there  on there  i thought he  handled himself  very well  earl did you feel  like you handled  yourself very well  and again i don't  know what happened  i stood up for my  guys that's all i'm  gonna say  again i really do not  want to talk about  this  okay  all right  here's ken 
[01:15:00]  ken you're on run  a fez  hey um i disagree  with the last caller  uh he got everything  he deserved because  at the start of the  phone call he just  wouldn't tell the  truth  he tried to hem  and haw and get  around the subject  and wouldn't just  own up to  responsibility  and he got what  he deserved  is that right  what own up  is that statement  true what's  happening  no they asked me  what we're doing  last night we were  working on production  last night  right  that's the truth  how is that  hemming and haw  that's that's not  how is that hemming  and haw  what they asked was 
[01:15:30]  was anybody in our  office and his  answer was no  no i said we were  working on production  that's what i said  you told them you  we were working on  production the only  place the one place  we work on production  is the bullpen  that you were in their  office  i said we were working  in the bullpen on  production  I wish I had heard this  You should have just answered the question  Yes or no  Like they asked it  You wouldn't have had all that  World of shit  I thought I did answer the question  They were  They were trying to  Whatever they were trying to 
[01:16:00]  Bait me into  I just would not go into it  I was like  You know what  We were working on production last night  That's the truth  What were you working on?  Production  Yeah  You're all upset like that  Crazy Bible lady  You know when you had your Bible  With you yesterday  There's something about  The Bible believers  That are just  Their anger is right there  All the time  I had it just to  Match her quotes  When she was just  Quoting stuff out of the air  Can I just bring up one thing? 
[01:16:30]  The Pope is on fire  The Pope  The Pope is on fire  He don't get no water  Let that heretic burn  First he was a liar  Now he's on fire  He don't get no water  Let that heretic burn  Did they win Best New Artist last night?  They should have  They remind me of the Roaches  I don't know  I don't know  If that goes back 
[01:17:00]  A little too far  Alright so  It looks like our show  Fuzzy  That there's tension  There's a lingering tension  With Earl  You have reverted to the  Little child in the family  That  Now what's going to happen?  What's going to happen?  That brings back  Your old stuff  Oh totally  I remember  There would be  One night a week  Because my dad worked nights  And my mom was home during the day 
[01:17:30]  And so they never really saw each other  And so anytime a fight would break out  Right  Would be Sunday night  It would be like the one time  They were both at home  Your favorite TV night  Exactly  Sure  And that's when the fights would break out  And I would just be shaking like a leaf  I would be a nervous wreck  And what I would do is  I'd put on Harper Valley PTA  I'd actually take the album out of the cover  Put it on the turntable  And do a funny dance to it  Where I would shake my ass  Trying to get everyone to laugh 
[01:18:00]  Instead of yelling at each other  It's so weird how similar you and I are  Because I remember when I was a kid  When my parents would start to fight  I would get into the liquor cabinet  And then just go through my mom's purse  Yeah I never did that  I never had a drink over it  Yeah  So not really all that same  I meant in a positive way  Like now I can finally treat this place  Like it's my house  Dylan  Dylan you're on Rana Fez 
[01:18:30]  How are you?  Hey Dylan  Hey how's it going?  Good  I just think that what Opie Anthony did to you  Earl this morning was wrong  I think it was unprofessional  And they have access to so many obscure sound bites  That I think that they could have came up with something  That they got from the Grammys last night  With not a big  Not a whole lot of problems  Well I don't know what the thing is  But see here's what you have to remember  Again  Earl and Opie go way back  They have this very strange relationship 
[01:19:00]  Fez and I noticed it when we first met both of them  That there was like either thing  Where like Earl was like fiercely loyal to those guys  Or he would leave the building for weeks at a time  And then you know I'd be like  Well I guess that's it for Earl  I guess Earl quit then  And the next time I would see him  He would be totally tight with him again  So they have this very dysfunctional thing  That goes way back  And you know  Opie's the one 
[01:19:30]  Who you know used to call me and said  Look I really think Earl's a new guy  And you're really gonna like him  He couldn't have pushed him anymore to me  But we knew this kind of stuff was gonna happen as well  It's like best friends and worst enemies all rolled into one  And it's like they like the drama  They like the dance  Does that seem true at all to you Earl?  Yeah  Break up to make up  I don't like drama  Period  I don't like any tension  In a way you do  It's that sexual energy that you're looking for  That you lack in your personal life 
[01:20:00]  I do not want to bang Opie  Thank you very much  No I'm not saying that  I'm saying it's a make up  For the fact that you don't have enough sexual tension  I got plenty of that tension  Niagara Falls  That girl  No  The Niagara Falls gal  No that's  That's Fezzy's fiance  Oh yeah I get mixed up  When I walked in today  Earl was asking for a nitro tablet  Were you really?  Here comes Opie  Hey Opie  Opie look what you left me with  Hey guys what are you talking about today? 
[01:20:30]  Take a look at what you left me with  What's wrong with him today?  He's in a pile over there  He won't even take his black sunglasses off  It's the late morning  And he's got the sunglasses on  He's all covered up  He's furious  He's throwing stuff  Alright I'll admit we might have went a little too far  By packing his box with his stuff  So he's not leaving?  Well I mean they're getting rid of the dead weight  And maybe we went a little too far 
[01:21:00]  He's not even looking at you  Earl I got you the gig  That part's true  Did I or did I not get you the gig?  So you're saying you can take it away at any time as well?  No I don't have that power  I'm not going to be cocky  I got you the gig Earl  I just did not appreciate getting a call at 8.15 in the morning  Getting screamed at  Our whole show is fucked up  Screamed at  We count on the audio that we collect overnight  Why?  And you sat in there 
[01:21:30]  You put your feet up  And you started changing the channels  That is absolutely  Positively not true  What?  Put my feet up and watch  Put my feet up  We were walking all last night  This place is  This place is  Earl's apartment  He can't  His own place  Is not livable  It's covered with what?  It's like moss in there or something Earl?  It's the black mold or something right?  No  We have a mold from the ceiling  And it's just surrounded by CDs  I'm not going to lie  Earl is walking around this place at night 
[01:22:00]  In a robe  He's brushing his teeth  This is where he lives  Does Earl have mold on his body?  Because he doesn't move too fast  It's a joke Earl  That's not going to help is it?  No it's just a joke  Nothing?  Earl what is it that you want to say?  Let's doctor fill this situation  I'm not saying anything  There's something that you  I will not say a thing  There's something you really want to tell  Anything I say at this point  Is going to be wrong  Look let's work it out  Yeah  This is a safe place  Let's work it out  This is a safe place 
[01:22:30]  Alright so maybe you didn't have  Your feet up on a desk  But you were changing the channels right?  No  He said yes on our show  I did not  And then he turned off the program  Is that true?  Oh god no  That is not true  Did you call E-Rock and say  Oh my god  I think I did something  We were working on  One of the  Adobe's in the back  And I went to minimize it  And I accidentally hit something else  What show were you watching Earl?  I was not watching anything  Girlfriends?  No  Are you telling me that you say 
[01:23:00]  So I called E-Rock and I said  Hey look  This is what  And I wasn't in a panic  I just said hey look  This is what happened  No no  Is this correct?  And I said  E-Rock was very passionate today  For the first time in a long time  On our show  Is that right?  He was yelling and screaming  He had a lot of energy  And the first thing I said  And I said because you know why  I don't want to screw up the audio for you guys  Well you did  I said I don't want to do that  We didn't even talk about the Grammys  And he walked me through the process  And we corrected the problem  No you didn't  We totally corrected the problem 
[01:23:30]  I went step by step  With him  I was like  Is this supposed to be there?  Yes  Is this supposed to be there?  Yes  So why do we have audio today?  I have no idea  You're saying my guys are dummies?  I'm not saying that at all  Who's the blame  And I'll say this again  The ONA crew has been amazing to this show  And to the crew  To our crew  They have been great with us  What do you accept?  Yeah you're accepting a fucking award up there  No  Yeah  Tonight we're Earl on it  But all except for E-Rock  Is that what I'm hearing? 
[01:24:00]  I'm not throwing E-Rock on the bus  E-Rock helped me out  Instead of Grammys audio  We had Fox News and Spongebob  Thanks to you Earl  You know what Earl loves Spongebob  Fox News was on all night last night  It was all when we got there  And also the What's Happening Marathon  Oh  Hey hey hey  Hey hey hey  Here's some audio from the ONA show today  Who lives in a pineapple under the sea  Spongebob square pants  Alright here comes E-Rock  E-Rock what happened  With you and Earl 
[01:24:30]  Earl called me  In a frenzy  That he thought he shut down  Our TV recording system  So I walked him through  And it seems that it was there  And we got a whole  Eight minutes of the Grammys  Before it got turned off  Earl why are you shocked  That you're taking the heat from this  If you know you're the one  Who shut it down somehow  No I didn't shut  I guess what I found out  I did not shut it down  E-Rock is it safe to say  That someone changed the channel  Yes  For the listeners out there  Maybe they don't understand  If you change the big TV  It screws up everything  Right E-Rock 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  So someone was sitting in there  Grabbed the remote  And said the Grammys are boring  I want to see what else is on TV  And that's what screwed up everything  God's honest truth  And I hate it every second of it  Fox News was on there  When we got in there  And it was on when we left  Then  Yeah but Fox didn't have the Grammys  Exactly  Which means I didn't change it  But the Grammys were on  For the first seven minutes  We have proof of that  Alright  Wow  Your people are running in  With communiques 
[01:25:30]  Our people are running in  With communiques  I smell cage match  Alright here's Anthony  On the line  How you doing Ant  Hi guys  How you doing  I'm just listening to this  Earl is getting me  In a tizzy  I'm driving in a tizzy  Listening to Earl  Saying that  He's like being called up  That early in the morning  And then trying to be  Coaxed into something  Or like  Trying to beat him  With questions  He asked him  Were you in our office 
[01:26:00]  He said no  That was a lie  A blinked lie  Earl were you in there  I said we were working  We were working in the bullpen  On production  That's what we were  We were in the office  The bullpen  The office  Now listen to the replay today  You'll hear it for yourself  He said he was not in our office  Wait a minute  He just left  He just left  He said he was watching  The Grammys in there  Where'd he go?  Where's he going? 
[01:26:30]  I hear yelling  I hear yelling  I love yelling  Alright  People are running  Mic it  Mic it  Screaming and running  Mars take a mic down there  If you would  One of the portable mics  What is going on?  A lot of screaming and yelling  Just went on down the hallway  I don't know if it was Earl or  Where did he go?  I'm not even kidding  What happened?  I'm not even going to kid  For the radio or anything  There's 12 guys  That just ran after Earl  With cell phones  I can't wait to call you  I'm running down the stairs right now  Where?  He can't leave  Eastside Dave  Huck cart 
[01:27:00]  Alright his phone is  Cutting in and out  Yeah turn that off  Because his madness  The preliminary report  Is that he just ran down the stairs  Then he went for the elevator  This is his job  He can't run out of here  He didn't like hearing the truth  The truth of the matter was  That he was being evasive  When being asked a simple question  He won't accept the fact  That we asked him  Where was he  Or anyone  From the Ron Fett show 
[01:27:30]  In our office yesterday  And he didn't even say  It's a yes or no question  Not  We were doing for Dr.  It's just that  Fucking question  And when he gets to the point  Where he's gotten  And someone has him  Then he's got to explode  And run away from the situation  That's what he's always done  Well  Someone we got on 58th street  He's got to be out there  There's nowhere else for him to go  Out the back entrance  I swear this is so  Any W  I used to see him  Running down the street  On my way in 
[01:28:00]  Remember when we used to come in  And you'd see Earl  And you'd say  Earl what are you doing  Oh I had to take a few hours  To cool off  A few hours away from his job  And then he asked him  To cool off from what  And he'd be like  Yeah  He would have nothing  At that point  Oh god  I saw him in the village one time  I swear to god  During the show  Alright here's Jimmy Norton  Jimmy what's happening out there  Earl makes me sick  He lied  He lied  He called up  Were you in the office last night  No  First thing he said was no  Listen for yourself in the report  He lied 
[01:28:30]  We don't have  He's got nowhere else to go  It's like getting mad at a homeless guy  He's got to sleep somewhere  He's  This place is basically his box  And now the ONA staff  Is in master control  Running our show  Because our staff  Just hightailed it down the steps  They actually are  They're in there  Helping you guys out now  Because they all abandoned ship  Apparently  Jesus  Apparently Ben is running down the street  With a cell phone  Right now  Ben's got jumped out of a heart attack  That's great 
[01:29:00]  Thanks  Thanks guys  They're trying to get him  Just look out the window  We should be able to see him go by  Do we have an XM copter  That can follow Earl  Around from spot to spot  Check with traffic  Now have you ever worked anywhere  Or had any job  Where a person could run out  I've never  I've never had the job  That's the beauty of radio  That you believe  The beauty  Yeah  Thank God Earl's not a pilot  Yeah  It's true  Earl's back  Alright  There he is  Okay he's back in the building  Alright good  Alright  Back in master control  Yeah  Let's check in with him 
[01:29:30]  Earl where'd you go buddy  Go ahead  Now here's the thing too  When Earl gets mad he gets slower  He's in no hurry now  Alright  Take your time Earl  I'm sorry  I was highly disrespectful  Alright what happened  Yes it was  It was insane is what it was  Alright Earl  Fez you walked out of the show once  I have a heart condition  Oh yeah you did  I forgot  What did Anthony say  That made you run out of here  I just don't want to deal with this  Yeah  At all  In my mind it's already over 
[01:30:00]  Hey you only got another  Two and a half hours  But Earl  Earl  I'm talking as your friend now  Not the asshole that does the radio show  Just admit you were wrong  Is there a difference  Sort of  Slight  I know them both  You can't tell  Alright Ronnie  I think you're worse off there  If I had to be honest  Earl  Admit that you were in there  And you changed the channel  That's all  I did not change the channel  We were working in that office  But I did not change the channel 
[01:30:30]  You said you were watching  A little bits and pieces of the Grammys  Yes in this room  Nobody believes him  He ran out of that flat screen TV  To watch that little shitty office  In this room  No you're lying  You're lying  You know what  Then don't believe me  I don't  Earl  You're covering for someone  Or you're lying  Earl  You're covering for someone  I am not  I will sit  I am not lying  With God as my witness  I am not lying  Earl take a deep breath  And walk us through last night  Off the air 
[01:31:00]  Hey you just turned this all off the air  He got upset  Turned off his mic  And turned everyone's mic off  From master control  In the process  Earl  That wasn't outrageous  Just take a deep breath  And walk us through last night  That's all I'm asking  Yeah just tell the truth  That's all I'm asking  Which  How  How are we supposed to believe  Anything he's saying  When the first question  I was asked of him  His answer was a lie  A lie  So now I'm not believing that  I did not change that channel  Period  You said you were in the office  Period  We were in the office 
[01:31:30]  We were doing production  We did not change the channel  So it changed itself  That sounds too much like Clinton right there  Did not change the channel  Earl  How many times do I have to say it  We did not change the channel  Yes you did  Look at me  Oh  Not that mic  He just body slammed the microphone  Do not break the XM equipment  I suppose you didn't do that either  Huh stupid  From 8 to 11 a.m.  You didn't change the channel  Of course they did  Earl I watched that shitty show  I kept turning it on and off  All night long 
[01:32:00]  It was terrible  But then I go  Well maybe something better is on  And I went back  I understand completely  What you went through  I got an important question for Earl  Sly  Sly  What did you think?  You never saw him?  Did you see Sly do his thing?  Uh huh  Uh huh  No response  Hold Earl  Oh my god  He broke that microphone  He broke it  The microphone  That he slammed down  There we go 
[01:32:30]  Yeah  Hello baby  Like he fixed it  Oh my god  What happened?  Did you see Sly and the Family Stone last night?  In this room?  Yes  Oh no  In this room?  Yes we did  What was on the big TVs though?  In our office?  What was on the big TV?  All night was Fox  So you were in there  And you had a concern about shutting something off  And then Fox just came on by itself  No it was on when I walked in the room  Then why were you on the computer with Eric trying to fix the program? 
[01:33:00]  No not fix the program  We were on the computer  So Earl  No  Is the point you're trying to make  That the ONA guys never set up the bullpen to record the Grammys?  The show  It was on Fox all night  They fucked up  So they fucked up  And they're blaming it on you  I'm not saying they did or they didn't  I'm just saying  I'm telling you what I walked into  It was on Fox  What happened?  Now what's going on?  Uh oh  They're taking him out of his room 
[01:33:30]  What happened?  Why?  Steve what happened?  Here comes Thayen  Why is Master Poe trying to remove Earl from the room?  What happened?  Why?  What is going on in there?  It's what it looks like  Why?  Working the equipment  What?  They don't want  Washington doesn't want Earl working the equipment anymore  Because they're afraid  D.C. has called  D.C. has called  Headquarters has called  Oh  Get out of there  Oh that's going to put him in an even better mode  Oh yeah  Alright  Well  Yeah 
[01:34:00]  Earl who said that you had to get away from the equipment?  I don't know  I was told D.C.  Who from D.C.?  I have no idea  Who got the call?  I don't know why I got removed  Who got the call?  I don't know who got the call either  Wow  Cindy Sheehan at the State of the Union address  Come with me miss  They're pulling you out of there Captain Bly  This is Captain Bly  They're going to put him in a little skip  Enough water  And here's my sextant  I know it to be 
[01:34:30]  I know it to be in working order  Who knows who made the call from D.C.?  Poe  How did you know to pull him out?  Steve  Steve  Alright  Well let's get Steve then  Yeah  This is a fine chain of command  Let's play the drug game  Alright  Who gave you the dope?  Because that money's going to the terrorists  Where's Steve C.?  Steve is wandering to the other side of the building 
[01:35:00]  He doesn't want  Here comes Ben  Ben  Somebody come in and say  Why Earl can't touch his board anymore  Believe it or not  We're still trying to do a radio show here  I mean  Steve  Earl  Who told you to tell Poe?  To pull Earl  Ben got a call from Wicky  And Wicky said get Earl off the board please  Uh oh  Wicky  Wicky?  Yeah he didn't want him breaking the equipment  I think that's an executive decision  I was throwing equipment around 
[01:35:30]  Proving he doesn't know good radio when he hears it though  Jesus  Earl  Now you gotta figure out a way to get even with Wicky  That's the problem for you  I wouldn't get even with anybody  I just wanna do my damn job  I would get a box  Put some stuff in it  And write Wicky across the top of it  Or give him a radio show  And then produce it  If your job is lying and ruining our club  Job well done  Earl  How'd you feel when you saw the box with your name on it?  Amongst the boxes of the other people that are leaving here 
[01:36:00]  He was not happy  That's everything he owns  Did it make you sad?  No  Not at all  It made me very angry  There's a hot plate and a can of beans in there  Why don't you show Wicky  And start breaking some of the stuff in here  If you were going postal  Who would you take out first?  I don't know  When you're not getting angry  I don't think straight  But just saying  Who would you take out first?  Whoever's in front of me  Quite honestly  Hey  Sure  Hey crime  Are we good?  Everything okay now Earl? 
[01:36:30]  No it's not  I don't  I don't  I'm not gonna say anything  Why don't you just tell us  What happened on Spongebob last night?  Maybe that's the way to go  That always cheers you up  A little Spongebob  No?  Earl?  Comment?  None  Earl's having a flashback to Carol Miller  And Scott to the walking down the hallway  Just like the old days  This really is a long relationship  That you've had with this Earl  This is the way basically 
[01:37:00]  Fez and I met you  During one of these heats  Who's the black guy?  Why is he so upset?  Full circle  All eyes are on you Earl  Keep moving  I'm not saying anything  You just said something though  Real mature  Oh  Alright how do we get back to square one Earl?  How do you fix this thing?  I want to do a radio show  Let's bring it all back together here  I said I didn't want to discuss it 
[01:37:30]  Let's move on  We gotta do this  Turn back time  Turn back time  Turn back time  I think Cher said it best  Yes  On the Grammys last night  Did you see it Earl?  It was great  Fez will be wearing the Cher outfit for you  How's that?  Nothing?  Alright  How much damage did you do at NEW over the years?  I know a phone was smashed there  Two microphones  I got you beat 
[01:38:00]  Two microphones  I think a studio door  Oh yeah  Who kicked in that door that cost a couple of grand?  No that wasn't me  That was  It happened twice  But one was completely an accident  Right  Alright Earl  Alright  Let's all sing together here  There you go Earl  If I could find a way  Sing it Earl  Like a Jenny Crank commercial  Earl what did you think of Sly and the Family Stone last night? 
[01:38:30]  Weird  Is there some reason he turned into Wendy O. Williams?  Is there any reason at all that happened over the years?  I don't even think that was him  I don't know who the fuck that was  What the hell was that?  I don't know what that was  He walks on stage for two minutes  Plays a little bit  And walks away  And they kept his mic off  Yeah  I would too  It's the kindest thing you could do  Wiki called halfway through the Grammys  Get him off the stage  Earl

[01:46:30]  A couch potato with a clicker in my hand  See motivation I never had  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad  For twenty years I never got a raise  I'm thirty-three and I've never been late  I look busy but I'm not  I'm just walking around  I pick up some papers and I put them back down  I'm gonna stop paying my rent  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum 
[01:47:00]  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  Then one day some lame brains came and took O&A away  And at the age of thirty-three  And at the age of thirty-three  I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders  And Ronnie Fezzy knew what I was going through  Every morning I'd unlock the door 
[01:47:30]  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more  Then I'd put away the bathroom key  Everybody was depending on me  I'd eat a chicken wing with lemonade  Lord, give me strength to make another day  Times I felt I couldn't go on  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone  Got lost in the van, I did my PSAs  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum 
[01:48:00]  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  I could hear Scott's old say  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum  You'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  Ken and Jeremy say  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum 
[01:48:30]  You'll always make it through  XM202  The OPN Anthony Show  When I think about the streak  I think about all the games I ever played in  I came to the ballpark every day  With a desire to play  My father taught me to put myself  In the hands of the manager  As he decides who will play each day  To win the game  The streak was a collection of individual days  That I was selected  And before long there was the streak  Managers like Frank Robinson, Earl Weaver, Johnny Oates  And others wrote my name in the lineup  Day after day  And created the streak 
[01:49:00]  I am proud of the fact that my managers felt  I was worthy to be in the lineup day after day  I never set out to break Lou Gehrig's record  But I am proud to be tied to one of the greatest players in baseball history  What began on May 30th, 1982  And continues September 6th, 1995  This game with the Angels trailing is now in the books  And let it be said  That number 8, Cal Ripken Jr.  Has reached the unreachable star

You feel like showing us a little something-something.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  The concept of the Neighborhood Watch Program began decades ago, with signs posted in yards  and curbs informing people that residents of this neighborhood were keeping an eye out  for suspicious strangers.  Now the nosy Nellies in some neighborhoods don't have to peek out the curtains anymore. 
[01:56:00]  They're getting some electronic surveillance assistance from police departments.  When a neighbor signs up with police for the Virtual Community Patrol Program, they get  web access to police surveillance cameras in the area, on their home computer.  They watch the cameras from the comfort of home, and if they see a neighbor or stranger  doing something suspicious, they type a couple of sentences into a web page, indicate which  camera to watch, and police instantly receive the information on their system. 
[01:56:30]  It's currently being tested by the East Orange Police Department in New Jersey, and is expected  to spread to communities nationwide.  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W dot com.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  It's the worst.  Dave, you really need to drink more.  I'm Dean, Anthony.  Siskel and Ebert, Anthony.  Finally?  Sure.  Okay.  I'm going to get the show back on track here.  I'm having a fine program, though.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Siskel and Ebert, outtakes.  Mm-hmm.  This was done, obviously, years ago, because Siskel is dead. 
[01:57:00]  This was his previous, Ebert's previous partner, and still when Ebert was big and fat, and they  would do these promos.  They would have to take promos for upcoming shows, and you hear them do the promo, but in  between, they're just miserable sons of bitches that are ragging each other, the writers who  was ever writing their promotion copy, anything.  They just come off as real miserable guys.  All right.  Here's the first track. 
[01:57:30]  Last week?  No, it's not.  Don't worry about it.  I know.  He was wearing a brown sweater.  This is not the part that's supposed to match, Slick.  Give it a moment's thought.  What are we doing now?  The promos.  Do you know what they have to match?  Nothing.  No promo ever has to match anything.  I thought we were about to do...  Welcome to the exciting world of television, a wholly new field for you to begin to learn  in.  Well spoken, Roger.  Well, that's something that you rarely hear.  A compliment really paid to you. 
[01:58:00]  Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner in the Pentagon thriller No Way Out.  That's this week on Siskel and Ebert.  You sounded very jaded.  What a dick.  Very jaded.  You can tell he's just a dick.  He just sits there and he said, well spoken, Roger.  And he goes, yeah, that's the compliment you'll never hear.  Because the guy can't talk.  For some reason, Siskel is mumbles.  I think that tumor was growing in his head as this was being taped because he goofs on  him about how he can't speak. 
[01:58:30]  He cannot...  He's all mumble mouth, tripping over words.  87, that must have been.  That's when the movie came out, I believe.  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  No Way Out.  Oh, sure.  Oh, good one.  David?  Stop touching me!  Two thrillers this week on Siskel and Ebert.  First, we'll review Michael Caine and Pierce Brosnan in the Fourth Protocol.  And then Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner star in No Way Out.  And we have a third thriller, too, if you're interested.  What do you mean, two thrillers?  They left out the Big Easy.  They only review two movies in every promo, so they picked those two. 
[01:59:00]  Why?  I don't know why.  I didn't pick them.  Ask the person that picked them.  Okay.  I think they probably went for star names.  It's this nitpicking that's going on between the two of them.  They hate each other.  Yeah.  They hate doing this.  Ebert hates that he likes to soak his Doritos before he eats them.  He hates that Roger, Siskel, fucking whoever, whatever their names are, fuck them. 
[01:59:30]  Fatso and Stemless.  Siskel's got a head full of soaked Doritos.  Like a little chip bowl for him.  Oh, man.  Just saying the name the Big Easy without any people involved means nothing.  It means nothing.  Randy Quaid.  Is he a star?  Dennis Quaid.  Close.  Dennis Quaid.  No.  Okay, read it this way, then.  Read it this way.  How about, no, let's, let's, why does this always have to be lockstep? 
[02:00:00]  How about something like this?  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert, and we've got three big ones.  And then three one-liners.  Dennis Quaid in the Big Easy.  Michael Caine in the Fourth Protocol.  So and so and no way out.  That's a better promo.  Okay.  Ready?  I guess you're going to do it.  You have to rewrite it, don't we?  Because you can't, you can't ad-lib, Gene.  Can we, can we do for the last week and when next week we'll do it, next year we'll do it next week? 
[02:00:30]  No, every week counts.  You read it, then.  You ad-lib it.  I'll do nothing.  Let him do whatever he wants.  This is going to be today's theme.  That's why I think we ought to write it into the...  No.  Let him do it.  Why don't we just have Gene say it's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert, and Roger does the...  I think I'd like to have it written on the monitor if that's okay.  For yourself?  Yes.  Okay.  So you start at the top, okay?  Put your second pause, then.  Start at the top?  Or make a new one.  Okay.  Yeah, they...  Wow.  I had no idea.  They cannot stand each other. 
[02:01:00]  Of course he can't ad-lib.  He's got one inch of room in there for brain.  No ad-libbing coming out of that pudding skull.  Four plus four is...  Better ad-libs out of a plate of chopped meat.  Also a more solid structure.  We have more outtakes from the guys.  Siskel and Ebert.  This one...  Wait. 
[02:01:30]  Ebert is telling Gene that he needs more energy.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies, and we've got three new ones.  Gotta have energy up and the movies out.  Why don't you read both parts?  I'd like to.  I know that.  Please get your energy up.  Quiet, please.  I can't read the top line.  There we go.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies,  and we've got three new ones. 
[02:02:00]  Dennis Quaid in the Big Easy,  Michael Caine in the fourth protocol,  and Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out.  That's this week on Siskel and Ebert and the movies.  Sound a little excited, Gene.  Sound less excited, Roger.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert at the movies, and we've got three new ones. 
[02:02:30]  And the movies, not at the movies.  And that's why we're doing it this time.  Come on.  God damn, these guys hate each other.  Dude, come on.  This is great.  They hate each other.  They hated each other.  I love this behind-the-scenes audio from celebrities.  Because you watch the show, and they're all like, 
[02:03:00]  oh, come on, Gene.  That was a good movie.  I thought, and they're all, it's all good-natured back and forth.  But, you know, underlying there is just this,  fuck you, shut up, I hate you.  Great stuff.  Well, in general, you don't like a person that has a different opinion than you.  Is that it?  So you think it's bubbling under the surface the whole time.  Just kind of bubbling.  When one of them says, you know, this movie's so good,  and the other one's like, it's a piece of crap.  What are you talking about?  That's got to bother you inside.  Yeah, but it goes so much deeper with these guys. 
[02:03:30]  They're just, they don't like each other.  They honestly don't like each other.  We're redoing this because of your flub.  Now it's because of your flub.  Because of you.  Babies.  Yeah.  It's Thriller Week on Siskel and Ebert and the Movies,  and we've got three new ones.  Dennis Quaid in The Big Easy.  Michael Caine in The Fourth Protocol.  And Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out.  That's this week on Siskel and Ebert and the Movies.  And the Asshole. 
[02:04:00]  Great.  That was great.  And that's Roger.  Oh, shit.  And the Asshole.  And that's Roger.  Siskel and Ebert and the Movies?  Why would they call it that?  At the Movies.  He doesn't.  Is it at the Movies?  It's supposed to be at the Movies.  Siskel and Ebert, at the Movies.  Of course.  All right, we've got a little more here.  The Science Fiction Thriller, RoboCop.  This week on Siskel and Ebert and the Movies.  This week on Siskel and Ebert and the Movies,  the Science Fiction Adventure, RoboCop. 
[02:04:30]  Do that again.  Very funny, Donna.  And you're my friend.  That's the last time you'll ever enter my home.  You know that for Gene, speech is a second language?  Roger's first language is,  yes, I'll have apple pie with my order.  He asked the McDonald's girls if he can have apple pie with their order before they ask him. 
[02:05:00]  Do you know what Gene says when he goes into McDonald's?  Can I have apple with their order?  Roger is the only guy in the history to ever answer yes to every question he's asked at McDonald's.  Want some salad with your apple pie?  Want some french fries with your salad?  Want some hamburger with your french fries? 
[02:05:30]  Want some shake with your...  Want some shake?  Want some shake?  I knew Gene...  Anything.  I knew Gene couldn't sustain that string for long without a grammatical error.  I don't know how many items there are, but they've worked them through the whole fucking menu.  He set a record.  Gene was in the other day.  He set a record.  He ordered every fucking thing they have.  He ordered a cone and a sundae.  Now, the other day, Gene was in there, and the little girl said to him,  would you like some french fries with your order?  Or Gene's answer was, no, maybe.  Other.  Other.  Up.  Up.  Dude.  Ah.  Yes.  No. 
[02:06:00]  Never mind.  Never mind.  And then he walked out.  Oh, they said, you know what they said, they saw Roger walking in, and they said,  one of everything to go, and one of everything to stay here.  When they saw Gene walking in, the little kid behind the counter called for the manager,  and said, Mr. Jones, can you come out here?  You can understand Mr. Siskel, can't you?  I can't ever understand him when he's ordering.  That didn't sound good. 
[02:06:30]  No.  No.  Oh, tumor.  I thought the same thing when he was coughing.  I go, uh-oh.  That's not good.  God damn.  That is funny.  All right.  What will you have, sir?  That's foreshadowing right there.  That's the Don Corleone in the garden cough. 
[02:07:00]  You're spilling my brain.  Death rattle.  Oh, gravity made a plant and fall over, movie critic.  Oh, what will you have, sir?  Pounder, quarter, pounder, quarter, pounder, quarter, pounder, quarter, pounder, pounder, 
[02:07:30]  pounder, quarter, pounder, no cheese, cheese, no cheese.  They ask Roger, do you want cheese with your cheeseburger?  He says, yes.  Shake milk, shake milk, shake milk.  Jesus.  Way to rip.  That was awful.  His brain is smoking at this point, trying to fight the tumor, trying to ad-lib.  Apparently, he had funny bone cancer.  Shake milk, shake milk, shake milk. 
[02:08:00]  Shake milk, shake milk.  Oh, geez, that don't sound good.  What would you like?  He goes to Burger King.  What would you like on it, sir?  The following.  Then he asks Roger what they have.  All the following.  And another thing.  And another thing.  Pickle.  Then he asks Roger what they have.  Now on his burger, he says, salad, cherry pie, and a Coke.  On the burger.  With all due respect. 
[02:08:30]  He's getting trounced.  With all due respect.  By the fat one.  I know.  Come on.  This week on Siskel and Ebert in the movies, the science fiction adventure, RoboCop.  Then they just go into the promo.  We got one more clip from Siskel and Ebert.  A lot of burger jokes, these two hacks.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they were cracking everyone up on set, though.  Oh, that awkwardness, because they're finally, they're, like, shitting on each other.  And this fat fuck, he owns everything. 
[02:09:00]  I have a headache.  And when Roger orders a burger, he wants one of everything.  Yeah, when Siskel orders a burger, he wants to drain clogged with hair.  Oh.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Oh, clogged drain.  Jesus. 
[02:09:30]  Oh.  All right, here we go.  He said Dewar, of course.  Dewar straight.  That's what that.  Favorite band.  That's because of, that's what that whole goddamn culture drinks to death.  All those wasps.  Wasps.  You know, they don't get enough shit, basically.  Why?  They don't.  They don't.  They're called yuppies now.  They run the goddamn country, and all of us, all of our, I'm speaking to everyone who's  eavesdropping right now.  All of us.  They don't run the whole goddamn country, Gene. 
[02:10:00]  What about the international bankers?  Oh, yeah.  Not to mention the Vatican.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about they run.  And the commies.  No, no, no.  They run the country.  The wasps run the country, and all of us should band together and overthrow them, and there could  be everybody, we could all have fun.  You think our president is a wasp, don't you?  No, he's not a wasp.  He isn't because he's Irish, so he's Celtic.  Do you know that they're Celtic?  Yeah, but you know what I'm talking about.  They're all Protestants. 
[02:10:30]  They've all been Protestants.  Do you know that?  Okay, we have to do this again.  Here we go.  Come on.  Band together, people.  Let's overthrow the country.  Protestants, people who sort of want a religion.  Here we go.  Let's stick together.  I know.  The Catholics and the fucking Jews, we go back a few years together.  Come on.  Hey, listen.  We're real.  We're real.  We get down and get dirty.  Listen, we were burning each other when Martin Luther was only a gleam in his mother's eye.  I'll take a Baptist.  I'll take a Baptist.  I go back 6,000 years.  Baptists, I mean, somebody that has some goddamn passion, some blood coursing through their veins.  Case closed.  Anything.  Right. 
[02:11:00]  Goddamn Protestants.  The biggest thing that happens for them on Sunday is a bake sale.  No, they got to decide what color yellow to tie to fucking buy.  That's right.  Okay, gentlemen.  He's right.  Gee, which would it be, lime green or dark green today, honey?  Right.  The only fucking religion that has the Reader's Digest is a prayer book.  Wow.  They don't get enough shit.  And they have all the money.  They have all the money.  The only last thing.  All those guys, they're all running Northern Trust. 
[02:11:30]  They have all the banks on LaSalle Street.  It's all horseshit.  The only time Protestants get on their knees is to adjust the fucking TV set.  They have all the goddamn insurance companies.  They have all the insurance companies.  They run the government.  They run everything.  You're right.  Okay, tape is rolling in.  Here we go.  Stand by, please.  Stand by.  Here we go.  Steve Martin's new comedy, Roxanne.  This week on Siskel and Ebert and the movies.  You said it a little too fast.  No, I think we were too long. 
[02:12:00]  We were, yeah.  Well, then it's going to have to be Siskel and Ebert.  Back it up a little bit.  Back up.  Stand by.  Steve Martin and Roxanne.  New comedy, I think you're saying.  That's right.  Steve Martin's new comedy.  Oh, fuck.  Now get your energy out.  Steve Martin's new comedy, Roxanne.  I already shot my wad on the Protestants.  And there you have it.  Sounded like he was talking about the Jews.  Protestants. 
[02:12:30]  Protestants.  Thank God, man.  It was like watching Voss try to argue intelligently.  Oh.  Like when that, you know Voss is in trouble when that little stiff hand comes out?  Like he's trying to like hush you so he can get his thoughts together?  Yeah.  And the little balloon animal hand.  Oh, it's just awful.  You want to just hug him?  I love little Jimmy Norton.  He's little and big at the same time.  I love little Jimmy Norton.  What does take Steve so long to get in here?  He's very pissed off today, by the way. 
[02:13:00]  He forgot to recharge his car.  Is that what it is?  Ask him about his condo he just bought.  Oh, no.  I think he bought a lemon.  Oh, no.  Just ask him about it.  Here comes Martini Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Oh, there he is.  Right in.  See, not many people.  Oh, he means business today.  Not many people in the studio.  He touched right down.  Yeah, certainly did.  And you got the I Hate You All t-shirt on.  I love this shirt.  Keith gave it to me. 
[02:13:30]  I like the L's in all our handguns.  Little Berettas upside down.  Yeah, that's good.  What is that from?  I think it's...  Is it Mafia Life?  Hold on, let me turn around.  Of course it is.  Enough said.  Mafia Life.  He's getting a piece of that action, isn't he?  Is he really?  I don't really know.  He's got to be.  He talks about it all the time.  He, like, all of a sudden will show up at the studio and he'll grab a mic waiting for  his chance to go, MafiaLife.com!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's a cool shirt, though.  I hear it's a pretty good game.  I don't know.  Don't know enough about it.  I haven't played it.  So, Steve, how's your new condo? 
[02:14:00]  Fuck.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I have these beautiful granite counters and I would love to find the people that sold  this fucking place to me and smash their teeth into them.  Oh, no.  Because...  Not enough cushy leaves on the bottom for hibernation.  Yeah.  I wish that was the least of my fucking problems.  Well, back up.  You had a really nice condo right outside New York City.  Yeah.  Your commute was nothing.  Steve is booming also.  Yeah, we're turning you down a little bit.  And you decided to get another condo in the same...  One at a bigger place.  So, in the same condo complex, there was one for sale. 
[02:14:30]  And, you know, it was newly...  What?  No.  I'm just thinking how you're not going to be able to resell this fucking thing as you  get on the radio.  Yeah.  This fucking place is a chasing...  Shit all.  No, it's actually...  The reality is it's a bigger place.  It's right on the Hackensack River.  So, it's got a great view.  And, you know, and it's...  The fact is it's right outside...  My commute is 12 minutes.  It's right outside of Manhattan.  And, you know, it's a place where the real estate values, you know, aren't going to go  down anytime soon. 
[02:15:00]  So, I'm happy to have it.  But...  On the Hackensack River, Wendy!  Oh, my God.  The people...  The people that renovated this place in order to sell it chintzed out so much on the contractors  they used that every...  And it wasn't stuff that we were going to find right off the bat with a home inspector.  Oh, boy.  So, as I'm living in it now, I'm finding stuff little by little.  You've only been in this place, what, two, three weeks?  A month, maybe?  Two or three days.  Oh, no, in two days you're finding shit?  You know, it's funny.  It's probably like a Hollywood set where you thought you had cabinets and they're just 
[02:15:30]  fake.  There's, like, nothing behind it.  Like a Twilight Zone episode where they wake up and they're in a fake house.  You're going to open up the cabinet or use the phone and it pulls right off the wall.  That's actually not a bad reference because that's the quality of construction we're talking  about here.  Oh.  They found...  They must have found guys that didn't have any, like, contractor licenses because the  work they did is so shoddy.  They're all working down at Rockefeller Center today during the Today Show is what you got.  And you didn't notice this as you were looking at the place before you bought it? 
[02:16:00]  We actually...  We had a ruthless house inspector who went through and checked everything and we found a lot  of it when he was there and they went back and fixed a lot of it.  Like, stuff like the dishwasher.  They put in a brand new dishwasher, but they didn't space it outright so when you opened up the  door it was banging into the brand new cabinets they put in.  Oh, man.  Oh, that type of stuff.  That type of stuff.  Like cabinets, like brand new cabinets in the kitchen, but you can't open two at the  same time because they'll rub into each other.  That kind of stuff.  Brand new light fixtures, but...  Do you really ever have to open two at the same time?  No, but it's... 
[02:16:30]  When you're searching, when you're looking around, where the fuck is...  That's a good point.  Brand new light fixture, when you turn it on, you get electrocuted.  Little things like that.  Brand new light fixture, but when you turn it on, you realize your phone is on a dimmer  switch.  Your phone?  Dude, my...  Like, the outlet that I plug my phone into is on a dimmer outlet for some reason.  So I didn't even realize that until a day after I plugged in the phone.  I'm like, how come the phone down here isn't ringing?  Then I turn the lights on in the house, and I realize, oh, the phone just went on.  Steve, we're going to need you to record something tomorrow. 
[02:17:00]  I'm going to make sure you come in kind of early, and...  I swear to God, my...  Everyone sounds like Tara Reid.  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, make sure you...  I'm on a dimmer switch.  I'm so wasted.  It's awesome.  New Tara Reid clips on the way, by the way. 
[02:17:30]  Ice.  You ever see that movie, the Tom Hanks, Shelley Long movie, The Money Pit?  Ah, yes.  Who hasn't seen that?  That is...  I'm having flashbacks or just flashes.  What was the first thing you found wrong?  You're walking around your house.  The wiring.  The wiring.  The wiring.  I had the phone guy...  That's just a small problem.  ...and the cable guys in there.  Not one cable guy, but four cable guys at the same time...  Wow.  ...in the house, rerunning all the cable to every room, because the people that had done  the renovations, when they put the new floors in and the new walls in, they cut through  all the phone lines and the cable lines. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, man.  So, like, you'd look at this cable wire coming out of the floor, and you'd pull on it, and  instead of, you know, getting, like, a little bit of give, the whole thing would come out,  because they severed it some way along the...  You know the contractor had, like, those time-life home-improvement books open on the counter  now?  Yeah.  What's the law?  Rewiring your house.  It is so bad, and the phone lines were like that, too.  So, the phone lines and the cable lines had to get rerun through the entire house.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, you poor bastard.  Do you, like, slam a door and you hear plaster coming down inside your walls?  Funny you should mention it, because the latest problem last night was the brand-new master  bathroom, which is, you know, retiled, and everything has a brand-new shower stall with  beautiful tile, is leaking through to the fucking living room.  Wait, what?  Oh, my God.  The bathroom?  The bathroom.  The new shower stall.  New shower stall.  It took...  It's upstairs, obviously?  It's upstairs on the second floor.  It took a total of three showers before...  So, it's not like water's getting on the bathroom floor. 
[02:19:00]  This is the actual shower stall that's leaking?  Well, we got out of...  The first time I took a shower, my wife looks at it and says, that's funny.  Look at all the water collecting.  And I'm like, oh, no.  Where was it collecting?  On the floor of the bathroom.  I thought, okay, maybe it's just a bad grouting job.  It's getting out of the stall and leaking into...  Yeah, whatever the...  It's called the pan in the bottom of the shower.  Okay.  It looks like it's just leaking onto the floor.  I'm like, all right, maybe it wasn't grouted right.  We can caulk it and, you know, it'll be okay.  Oh, my God.  Three showers later, I'm walking downstairs and I hear drip, drip.  Oh, no! 
[02:19:30]  Oh, you poor bastard!  What the hell is that?  I look up in the sheetrock ceiling above the fireplace, which is directly underneath where that  shower is.  I see buckled sheetrock ceiling.  Just a pool of sweat.  Just.  Oh, I'm looking at this going, you've got to be kidding me.  And then it's just dripping, dripping onto this brand new hardwood floor.  And I'm like, oh, God, what is this?  Have you taken it out on your wife yet?  Just named her?  No.  No, because she's almost catatonic at what's going on.  Went to put her head through the wall and it went right through. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, it was nice.  With barely any pressure.  It was nice.  No beams behind there to really cause any damage.  She didn't get any bruises?  Nothing.  Nice and mushy.  So, last night I stuck my hand through the sheetrock ceiling and just ripped down chunks  of it.  Oh, that's good.  That's what you want to do in a new place.  Unfortunately, that's what you've got to do in order to make sure you don't get mold in  the ceiling.  Yeah, well, if you see your ceiling dripping, there's a hell of a lot more damage above  what you're seeing.  Exactly.  Like, when you see a wet spot on your ceiling, it's a lot worse than what you're looking at. 
[02:20:30]  Right, exactly.  So, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that I can get a...  Tip of the iceberg.  Thank you, Bill.  So, I would love to find these people and just smash them both.  Finds out it's downstairs toilets made out of styrofoam.  Spray-painted gray.  It sounds like you didn't inspect this place too good.  Inspected it really well.  Yeah, what happened with the inspectors?  The inspector found a lot of stuff.  The first thing the inspector saw was the toilets weren't secured down.  Like, all three bathrooms that had been redone, the toilets weren't bolted to the floor. 
[02:21:00]  Did they let you in the house?  There it is over there.  Don't get too close.  We found...  We just painted everything.  So much stuff.  Like, upon home inspection, and we were like, all right, you and your shoddy construction  assholes have to redo X, Y, and Z, and we found a list of 12 things, and we thought,  okay, that's it.  Turns out there was a lot more than that that we just didn't catch, and it wasn't something  you were going to find until you'd actually lived in it.  There are so many things you have to do.  No, you know what you've got to do?  You've got to turn on all the water in the house.  Yeah.  You've got to turn on the showers and hang out and let him run for a while. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  See how long the hot water lasts.  Well, that's exactly...  Things like that.  That's exactly what he did.  Like, he aimed the shower head right towards the drain, and it, for 10, 15 minutes, didn't  leak.  So I'm thinking, okay...  You're not going to see it.  It was probably leaking, but it takes a little while to get through the sheetrock.  Yeah, apparently.  And that's what we're finally seeing.  Oh, boy.  But you're saying if you go to buy a house, that's what you're supposed to do?  Yeah.  Turn on the water, let it run, see how long the hot water lasts, because sometimes you  go into these places, now you need a new hot water heater, because the cold water, after 
[02:22:00]  three minutes, you can't have two things running at once.  Run the dishwasher, run the shower, check to see how hot it's getting.  Well, that's one of the things we knew we needed.  People must hate you when you come over.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Oh, it's great.  We actually had a great home inspector, and like, for instance, a new water heater was  one of the things I knew I needed.  Yeah.  And that's just...  It happens.  You know, it gets 9 or 10 years old, you have to replace it.  They're electric bill by 200 bucks, and you're just like, you know what?  I'm not going to buy it.  I don't want it.  I'm not making an offer.  Turn on the AC.  I want the doors open.  I want to see if you can actually air condition outside, like my father used to say. 
[02:22:30]  What are you, air conditioning the whole neighborhood?  I want to do that with your house.  You got to.  You got to do that.  You got to go on rainy days.  You got to go when it rains.  Take a look around at the windows.  All the windows.  At the skylights.  Shit like that.  See if that fucking shit's leaking.  It's very involved buying a house.  No, it's true.  You know they set it up during prime time.  Of course they do.  Anthony just brings his own hose.  Yeah.  I'm just going to squirt your house. 
[02:23:00]  I bring a fire truck with me.  Go ahead.  Hose the roof down.  Just climbing up on the roof.  Just blasting everything with his hose.  Because you just don't know.  And the only way you know these things is by learning them the hard way.  Yeah.  The house I'm renting now, and I'm renting it in Great Neck, the roof leaks.  Roof leaks.  And I find this out, that the skylight leaks.  After a week, we've been living there, and we get a downpour.  And I just start hearing boop, boop on the terracotta tile floor.  Right where I decide.  It's actually about five inches in front of where I decide to put my brand new 65-inch television. 
[02:23:30]  So that was kind of close.  That was a close one.  And then the air conditioner starts leaking.  The condensate on that.  So you got to call the guy.  He fixes it, but not before a whole line of spackle tape comes down in the living room.  Oh, man.  And then it's raining a couple of weeks back, and we notice that over one of the kitchen cabinets,  boop, boop, boop, there's drip going on over there.  And I go out to the back deck one day, and the whole gutter to the back of the house is laying on the deck. 
[02:24:00]  Just fell off the side of the house.  Then on a windy day, one of the trees by the driveway just fell over into the driveway.  And the moths, I have no idea where they're coming from, what they're doing there,  but there are moths in the house a number of ways.  It's a moth army.  They have taken over the house.  And you're running a nice house, right?  Yeah, very nice.  I look like a schizoid at night. 
[02:24:30]  I'll be laying there watching TV.  Out of nowhere in the dark, my girlfriend gets awakened by me going,  Like, or I go, trying to blow the moth away.  It's moths.  Moths.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  They're laying eggs in your mouth when you're sleeping.  In my ear.  But that's, you know, that's what we do now.  We wake each other up by just clawing at the air like lunatics. 
[02:25:00]  And that's just what I can remember.  And it's stories like that that make you realize that you might not have it so bad,  or at least there's a hundred other people that have gone through the same experience that you have.  Why don't you get, like, netting around your bed?  You want, like, a malaria?  We should do that.  We should buy him, like, a beekeeper outside.  Sleep him.  That would be nice.  Here come the photoshops on whackbag.com.  Anthony and us.  We're watching movies, and, like, all of a sudden, like, last night we're watching Alexander.  We'll talk about that homo movie later.  No, say it now, man. 
[02:25:30]  And then we'll get back to Steve because I'll wait a little later because I just want to talk about the moths on the TV.  They show this outdoor scene, and there's, like, a mountain range, the Himalayas, and the sky.  And there's moths flying toward the sky because it's the brightest thing in the room because the lights are off.  And we're joking about, you know, giant moths in the movie.  It kind of takes you out of the movie when there's giant moths flying over the Himalayas.  They will go to any light source at all. 
[02:26:00]  You click over the light over our heads on the bedroom set thing to grab something, and, like, they just flock to it.  They come at you.  They turn it off.  That's hilarious.  And they come out of nowhere, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you have company, you've got to try to play it off.  Is that a moth?  No, no.  It's just a plasma screen.  They look that real.  High-definition television, you idiot.  We walk into your house right now.  We're going to see moths.  Absolutely.  You'll just see one.  Absolutely.  One, dude, on the walls in the hallway. 
[02:26:30]  For some reason, they're congregating.  When I turn on the air conditioner, they congregate around the return air grill.  I think maybe slowly the airflow kind of moves them in that direction.  But then in the morning, I shut the AC off or the house gets too cold.  When I go to turn it off, that hallway, I turn the light on, and it's just moth hallway.  They're all over the walls.  You know they're preparing for an attack, right?  Of course they are.  They're moths.  I know how they act, how they operate.  Do you go on a killing spree? 
[02:27:00]  No.  I kill them at my leisure when they kind of fly near me.  I'll claw at them or slap them or flick them.  Get that white powder on your hands.  Yeah, they're too annoying to clean up.  I'd rather they just flutter in an area I'm not.  I only use the bedroom and the living room.  Anywhere else, the moths have taken over.  They live there.  I'm paying rent for the moths.  I don't know what to do about them.  That is so weird.  And they came out of nowhere. 
[02:27:30]  One day, one day they were there.  Before, they weren't.  A time of year, I'm just waiting them out until winter.  I know they can't survive the winter.  What if you just crank the AC to the point that they all die?  Kind of like that bee movie, the killer bees they drove into the Superdome.  Or the blob where they put them in the movie theater and turned on the air conditioner and hit them with the CO2.  That too.  The blob fit into a movie theater?  The original.  I want to know more about the bees in the Superdome. 
[02:28:00]  One of those killer bees.  Killer bee movies.  They beeped a horn on the little Volkswagen bug.  All the bees came on it.  And then they drove into the Superdome.  And they turned on the AC.  And then they all died.  What a horrible movie.  Are you kidding me?  That was a really bad movie.  I remember that one.  But I think that's the solution.  Just crank them out.  Freeze them out.  I'll crank it down at like 50 degrees.  So, Steve, what are you going to do?  Start calling contractors. 
[02:28:30]  And that's really it.  It's just piece by piece.  As we find these things, we can just call it.  There's no lemon law with the house?  I don't know.  I'm finding that out.  I mean, it might just be that I'm screwed since the house has been closed.  I don't know if there is a period of time.  No what the fuck clause?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's a really good question.  It's going to cost you a lot of money.  You just have a collage of pictures.  You know, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  I mean, come on.  Come on.  That's your defense.  Come on.  Come on.  We found out that they didn't get any construction permits. 
[02:29:00]  So, I'm hoping that there's something retroactively.  We're hoping that retroactively we can go back and nail them for that.  See, you always find this shit out afterwards.  What about if they violated some sort of construction code?  You can't go there?  Well, that's exactly.  They'll probably condemn your house, throw you out.  You won't be able to live in there.  Exactly.  Well, thank God I still own the other one.  Oh, you're a two-house.  Oh, look at you.  A little mobile.  Steve Trump.  But they didn't pick up our contracts.  How are you able to look at you?  You're just praying.  A little nervous, I bet.  Well, you know, the idea is you rent the other one out to offset the mortgage in the new place. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  A lot of questions for Steve.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Make it fast, Ben.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say that the honeypot that was in the...  Ah, fuck.  Punch out.  Punch out.  You have time.  Yeah.  See?  He punched out.  He saved himself.  He saved himself.  That joke right now is flaming wreckage, but he's watching it from under his canopy.  Safe.  He's safe.  That cost him a lot.  You know, that joke is in flames, but he's fine. 
[02:30:00]  Todd, New Hampshire.  What's up?  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Love your show.  Steve, did you get owner's title insurance?  Certainly did.  Yes, I did.  You did.  All right.  Check that policy.  In certain cases, you might be covered, you know, if there's no due diligence when they  bought the place.  Due diligence.  All right.  There you go.  A little advice for Steve.  That's a good phrase to start throwing around the scare people.  Due diligence.  Due diligence.  Do your DD.  Uh, Tony.  Tony. 
[02:30:30]  Hey.  No?  All right.  Let's say hi to Adam in Tampa.  Adam.  Hi, fellas.  I want to give a long-distance happy birthday dedication to little Jimmy.  Hey, Anthony, is the reason why we don't see you wearing a shirt more than once because  the moths are eating them?  All right.  I'm going to find my secrets out.  Oh, I hope he's always commented on why I don't wear the same clothes twice.  I've never seen that shirt.  The moths have eaten everything.  And this is the same shirt I wore Friday.  Yeah.  But that's not a very memorable shirt.  No, it isn't.  It's just a bland beige. 
[02:31:00]  I was going to say, in the words of Dice, it's beige.  No, it's kind of grayish.  And it's got a darker gray and a black stripe.  Right across the chest.  And that's it.  It's got on action wear.  I enjoy this shirt.  Thank you very much.  Let's go all the way out to Wisconsin.  Who makes that?  Wilson?  Comes with a volleyball neck.  There's no alligator on it.  There's nothing.  That's a no-name shirt.  Just a prop they throw in the box when you get your volleyball. 
[02:31:30]  That's a mannequin shirt.  Yeah, you're not committing to anything with that shirt.  You know that, right?  No, this is a Monday kind of shirt.  That's like the old sitcoms when you couldn't have any product placement.  It just said beer.  Yeah.  This thing just says shirt.  The polo horse should be.  So fucking early, I didn't even notice that.  Really not making much of a commitment to the shirt.  The collar's too small.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's a disposable. 
[02:32:00]  The mods can have this one.  Nick in Wisconsin, what's up?  Yeah, Steve, I was wondering, was Eric Estrada involved in selling you the condo?  I didn't know.  Have you seen Eric Estrada walking these condos down in Florida?  They actually built his house right outside Radio City Music Hall.  Did he get in trouble or something?  The company he was working for did.  Yeah.  They weren't even selling houses.  They were selling land in like some marshy part of Florida.  Yeah, it was land.  It kind of made it sound like you were buying a house, and the pictures they would show were 
[02:32:30]  these beautiful neighborhoods with these houses, but you were buying land that theoretically  you can build this type of house on.  There he is.  You might remember me from Chibs.  Yeah, and he gets on and hawks his real estate deals, and then they found out that it was really  a sham.  Right.  Let's go to Trench Mouth, the trucker.  Trench Mouth.  Hey, what's going on this morning?  What's up, man?  Hey, Anthony, you can go in the hallway with the doggone vacuum cleaner, just pull the 
[02:33:00]  end off of it, and you can suck all them bad mouths up, and you ain't got to touch them  or smash them.  Yeah, they probably suck up real nice in the vacuum.  Yeah, but Anthony...  Dust Buster.  Yeah.  Anthony doesn't want to hear him scream, though.  I'd love to hear him scream.  I'd really hear them screaming, Anthony screaming, waking me up in the middle of the night.  That's pretty good.  A dust buster, and just go around the house sucking them all up.  That's all you have to do.  I like that.  And then the poor little...  Always have a good one.  Go ahead and go to the back of your throat, like Silence of the Lambs.  Your wife's going to be taken out with the tweezers.  And then the poor little fellas will just suffocate in the middle of the vacuum. 
[02:33:30]  Good.  Scott in Ohio, what's up?  Hey, you got to get rid of those moths, man.  They'll end up in your cereal boxes and everything else at the nice present in the morning.  Nah, I haven't found any in food.  That's good.  I don't think they're the type that go in your food.  These are just hanging around moths.  Oh, man.  I haven't found any in the food.  I just remembered.  I think I blocked this out.  That happened to me this weekend.  Really?  What was it?  I bought a box of cereal at a bodega. 
[02:34:00]  Never a good thing to do.  Stop it.  Why?  So I'm eating corn checks, I believe.  And I look down at my milk after having a couple of bites.  And I see one of those little flies.  And I'm just like, God damn it.  And I throw the whole thing out.  I'm thinking it flew in there.  Yeah.  So the next day, you know, I'm fucking just chowing.  And I look down after, you know, I'm watching SportsCenter.  And I fucking look down.  And there's about seven drowned little bugs in there.  And I was just like, you got to be there in the box. 
[02:34:30]  They're in the box.  In the box.  You know how many you ate?  Probably ate a few of them.  Oh, I had 14.  I like brush my teeth.  I'm flossing like.  Oh.  I'll tell you what was unreal was it still was a good bowl of cereal until I fucking saw it.  So you found out.  I understand those starving people now.  I'll eat that.  Oh, yeah.  God.  All right, Steve.  Well, good luck on the house.  Thank you.  That stinks.  You know he's got some flaming shoes. 
[02:35:00]  The kind of Pyra would admire.  He makes contestants bring in food.  And he runs the Foundry Music Empire.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[02:35:30]  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire.  He only buys flaming attire.  His clothing's like a barbecue.  His laundry never needs a dryer.  If you're selling burning shoes.  This drunken Lebanese will buy him.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[02:36:00]  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire.  He only buys flaming attire.  He only buys flaming attire.  You know he's got some flaming shoes.  The kind that Satan would desire.  If you're with him drinking boots.  The smoke detector is required.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire. 
[02:36:30]  He only buys flaming attire.  He only buys flaming attire.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini, Steve's clothes are on fire.  law posts are on fire.  Don't talk to him rulings in.  Mario 2.

[02:37:30]  60-20 Sports.  Our show's about generational differences  in sports. Like the best sports movie.  Despite the fact that I don't like Notre Dame,  you have to go with Rudy. Someday I'm going to come  out of that tunnel and I'm going to run onto this field.  Rudy was, like, a fun  movie, but he wasn't a great sports movie  a lot of times. What do you say? Raging Bull.  James Carville is 60, Luke  Russert is 20, and they're talking sports.  Check out 60-20 Sports on  XM Live, Channel 200. This Friday  morning, 8 a.m. Eastern. 
[02:38:00]  And now, a minute with the New York  Times. Here's health and nutrition  columnist Jane Brody. Many parents  drive SUVs on the theory  that they are safer, more likely to  protect a child in case of an accident.  The bigger and heavier the vehicle  they think, the better protected the  passengers are likely to be.  But aside from wasting money on gas,  SUVs may be less likely  than an ordinary car to protect  children when the vehicles are involved  in a crash. In a report  in the journal Pediatrics, 
[02:38:30]  researchers described their study of  crashes in which almost 4,000  children were traveling in either  an SUV or a car.  They found that rollovers occurred  twice as often with SUVs  than with cars, and children  were three times as likely to be injured  in a rollover than in other kinds  of accidents. Parents should be  sure that children are always  properly restrained when riding in  vehicles, especially SUVs.  This is Jane Brody of the New York 
[02:39:00]  Times.  Taking a look at your baseball action  for Tuesday, March 28th  on XM Radio.  There's a high fly ball on the left field.  That's deep. That's way back there.  It's on its way. It's a three-run  home run for Brett Tomko.  How about that?  105 p.m. Eastern starts,  the Tigers and Dodgers on  XM 189, the Cardinals and Orioles  on XM 187, the Twins and Blue Jays  on XM 179.  Also at 105 p.m. Eastern, 
[02:39:30]  the Mets and Marlins on XM 185,  and the Braves and Astros on XM 186.  There's a line drive to right,  and it is caught by Kedire.  Wow, what a catch.  In 305 p.m. Eastern starts,  the world champion White Sox and the  Diamondbacks on XM 188,  the Padres and Angels on XM 181,  and the Cubs and the Mariners  on XM 182.  And that's your game day spring  training schedule for Tuesday  on XM Radio to the Power of X. 
[02:40:00]  High Voltage is an XL channel  which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available  by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO  or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the Opie  and Anthony Show.  Why do they even report radio  in the newspaper?  Huh?  I don't even know why they report  radio in the newspaper.  It's got to just be thankless  to be the radio reporter.  You walk around in the Daily News building  or the Post building, 
[02:40:30]  and you're like,  there he goes,  the radio reporter.  You know,  they're just like looking at him  and going,  this guy is like  one more technological jump  closer to unemployment.  Like,  they're just not going to  report on it anymore.  Who's lower?  Radio guy  or crossword puzzle guy?  Does he even,  is there even a guy?  Or the bridge guy?  You know,  the guy that like  writes the bridge column?  Right.  Ooh,  queen to your left?  Or,  like,  I don't even understand the game. 
[02:41:00]  And that's like a horrible,  these are,  can't you put ads  in those spaces  and make a little money?  I've,  I've been thinking about that  for years,  you know,  reading the newspaper every day.  There's so much shit in here  and,  and you gotta think,  you know,  you're looking for an audience  for all this stuff.  Yeah.  How many people are reading  the queen left bridge?  Let me,  I'm buying the paper.  Throw the rest away.  Give me the bridge page  because I gotta know  what to do  if I just drew  a king,  jack,  queen, 
[02:41:30]  bridge.  What fucking year is this?  What century is this?  Bridge.  Hmm.  Unbelievable  that they still have the bridge.  Oh yes,  yeah,  I read Gridlock Sam  all the time.  Gridlock Sam.  Gridlock Sam.  Sam Schwartz.  My God.  He lets you know  where the traffic is.  Okay.  Dude,  when is the paper printed?  Is this guy a fucking psychic?  Wouldn't he be better  to tell you  what the lotto numbers  are gonna be  than where traffic might be  in the morning 
[02:42:00]  when the fucking paper  comes out?  I predict  a tractor-trailer jackknife  on the FDR.  But it's Gridlock Sam.  It's Sam Schwartz  and he knows everything.  He certainly does.  Why would you put  a traffic reporter  in the newspaper?  What are you reading this  while you're driving?  You have the folded up paper?  Hey,  what's this accident?  It doesn't say anything  about this in the paper.  What a dope.  Gridlock Sam says  I should avoid...  Whoa!  He was right!  Fucking grid... 
[02:42:30]  This Sam is great!  I'm gonna get on the park.  No, I'm not!  And Sam said I shouldn't.  Traffic in the paper.  Yeah,  there are just these...  And they're not on one page.  Oh, no.  Like, they...  They intersperse them  throughout the newspaper.  Yeah,  I'm trying to find some more.  But basically,  getting back to the country  thing that we discussed here,  then out of nowhere  it just says,  and low ratings alone  aren't enough to trigger  that urge to get a country  station here in New York City. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  While WNEW is on the rise now,  it was basically dead air  after the August 2002  St. Patrick's scandal  blew Opie and Anthony away.  Oh, yeah.  But Parent Infinity  never seemed to seriously  consider trying country.  You'd think that was  the big opportunity,  says Tom Taylor,  editor of the newsletter  Inside Radio.  If WNEW didn't go country,  then it's unlikely  it's going to happen  anytime soon.  And that's what  your XM satellite radio's for.  All right.  You want the country?  You got the country. 
[02:43:30]  Now I'm looking for  other things in the paper  that are a waste of time.  Yeah.  Well, the paper, I...  Like, who's doing  wordy-gertie every day?  Wordy-gertie?  Wordy-gertie.  Oh, but you don't know  entertainment  until you've done  the wordy-gertie.  What is wordy-gertie?  The little puzzle...  Oh, basically,  it's two words  that rhyme, right?  Like, obese, feline.  Right?  What?  No.  Would be a fat cat. 
[02:44:00]  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh!  Wow!  Well, I didn't know  we had a wordy-gertie pro  here in the studio.  Let me just step back  and let Mr. Wordy-gertie...  Wordy-gertie!  I forgot that my brother  only leaves his house  twice a year.  He has plenty of time  to be an expert  at all this stuff.  Ah, I get it.  You know who  beast primate is?  Shut up!  What?  It's a chunky monkey,  remember?  Right, you said that.  Yeah, it's a good one. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, wow.  There you go.  I guess wordy-gertie  sweeping the nation  everywhere.  Wordy-gertie.  Search for a litter's...  I thought you were going  with somewhere else there,  Jimmy.  You scared me.  Oh, no.  It's a bigger...  Why don't we play  wordy-gertie today?  Search for a litter's  littlest.  What?  Search for a litter's...  Runt hunt.  Littlest.  Yes.  Runt hunt.  That's right.  Very good. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, I got it!  There you go,  Mr. Wordy-gertie.  Ah, policeman's karate blows.  Cops chops.  Cops chops.  Had the cops part.  See, that one was  when I was in the finals  of the wordy-gertie last year.  Oh, was that?  They used that one,  so I remembered it.  Finals.  Fucking idiot.  Wordy-gertie stinks.  Yeah.  That's horrible. 
[02:45:30]  Wait, what rhymes with  kill yourself, both of you?  Wordy-gertie.  All right.  Well, I did see you  doing the Sudoku.  Sudoku.  Sudoku.  This has taken off.  No, it hasn't.  Yes, it has.  No, it hasn't.  Look how big it is now.  It's half the page.  Now, the crossword  is now only half the page,  and Sudoku  is now half the page.  There's a girl on the set.  She's a stand-in,  and she does those all day. 
[02:46:00]  She has a book  of those Sudoku things,  and she asked me  if I wanted to do one.  I wanted to throw  the book at her.  Can someone explain  what Sudoku is?  It's like Bukkake,  only with numbers.  What is Sudoku?  It's a bunch of numbers, right?  Yeah, and they have to  add up to a certain amount  in each square.  Yeah.  It's basically...  Mr. Sudoku,  you did it,  wordy-gertie.  It's basically  a logic puzzle.  Is it?  Chink thinks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks!  Thanks! 
[02:46:30]  Thanks!  I enjoy the  crypto quote,  but only Newsday  has that,  I think.  Each letter  is a different letter.  You have to decode it  just based on the  format of the paragraph.  I do those  whenever I get the chance.  Try doing one  without a pen one day.  That's a challenge,  my friend.  You can't fill in  anything.  You just look at it  and do it.  Did that once.  Had nothing to do all day. 
[02:47:00]  It took me eight hours.  How about this?  No.  How about a big,  fat no?  I don't want to be  smarter.  We were going through  the paper today.  I don't want to exercise  my brain.  And just getting annoyed.  And not even at what  we're digging at now.  Oh, yeah.  So dope.  What you just heard  for the last 15 minutes  was off-the-cuff stuff  from your pals  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Like the WB.  On a fresh Opie and Anthony.  We were just trying out  fresh material  for everybody.  Working it out live 
[02:47:30]  on the air.  So then  the ten other times  we do this discussion  will get better and better.  Right.  You know,  I think by 2008  we'll have this discussion down.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  We were kind of going through  and the Post  was just pissing me off.  I wanted to jump.  Well, the New York Post  used to be a newspaper.  I don't know.  Is it a newspaper still?  No.  It's like 
[02:48:00]  The Inquirer.  Things like that.  It's all sensationalism.  A lot of tabloid type of stuff.  I need a newspaper here in New York  that's somewhere in between  the New York Post  and the New York Times.  That's all I'm asking.  Yeah, Times is too much.  Times is ridiculous.  They leave that  like in front of your hotel room door.  I just step over it.  It's too...  It's cumbersome.  It's heavy.  It's wordy-gurdy.  Oh, words.  Too many words.  Words, words.  Block words.  Block words.  Block words.  Yuck.  And what's with the 
[02:48:30]  Fred Flintstone camera pictures  they have in there too?  They look like they've been  chiseled in rock.  Look, we've had the camera  for quite a few years.  How about putting a photograph  in there instead of some  stipple drawing in ink?  You've got to see the guy  that writes the story  drawn like the bird  putting the image on the rock  in the Flintstones.  Why are they so against  a photograph?  Hey, before you get  into the post thing,  a bunch of people  have wordy-gurdies  for us today.  Ellis in Philly, 
[02:49:00]  you have a wordy-gurdy?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Baby Sinker.  Baby Thinker?  Or Baby Sinker?  Baby Sinker.  T-H-I-N-K-E-R?  Baby Sink.  S-I-N-K.  Like what Bob Fox  is saying?  Baby Sinker.  Oh, Sinker.  Sinker.  Baby Sinker.  Scott Peterson.  No, it has to rhyme, Jimmy.  It has to rhyme, Jimmy.  Oh.  Anyway, get the  a do-do-do-do. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Baby Sinker.  Baby Sinker.  Baby Sinker.  We're going to play  wordy-gurdy today.  I'm all excited.  Yeah.  Excited.  Tot Clot.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know.  Any other guesses?  You got to work these out.  Wait a minute.  Baby Sinker.  Baby Sinker.  That's tough.  Baby Sinker.  Oh.  Connor Goner?  Yeah, that's good.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:50:00]  The wordy-gurdy expert.  Got it.  Good one.  Wow.  Nice.  Connor Goner.  Excellent.  He threw me with Sinker, though.  I was thinking of like  weight, bobber, anchor,  something like that.  Connor Goner.  I had the Connor,  but I couldn't get the  Goner.  Let's be honest.  Wordy-gurdy.  Maybe I didn't get a rhyme, but.  Yeah, you had the Connor.  Who didn't?  Although you could have had  the five little kids there  in the bathtub,  or you could have the two  in the minivan. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, it looks like the listeners  are attempting to take over the show.  This happens every once in a while.  Every so often.  Let's say hi to Troy.  Troy?  What's up, fellas?  Hi.  An African-American truck driver.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  African-American truck driver.  Um, something rigger.  I know.  No. 
[02:51:00]  A brother trucker.  Oh, that doesn't rhyme.  Oh.  You are the worst wordy-gurdy guy ever.  I don't play wordy.  Sorry.  Oh.  You're wordy awful.  I'm wordy nerdy.  LOL.  All right.  Yeah, we know what that one is,  you idiot.  All right.  Blap, blap, blap, blap, blap.  Let's go to cigars and scotch.  Cigars and scotch.  Huh?  Hurl a midget. 
[02:51:30]  Hello?  Hurl.  Hurl?  Hurl a midget.  Hurl a midget.  A midget.  Well, start the music.  Tosh Voss.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, we got some experts in the studio.  Voss, Voss.  Let's say hi to Jeremy.  All right, I got one for you.  Low T-cell count Norton.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, hit the music.  Yeah, and I can't think. 
[02:52:00]  Low T-cell count Norton.  Hmm.  Can you stop whispering, Hawk?  You probably got it.  Can you please have a little gumption?  Skinny Jimmy.  All right, hold on.  Dude.  Dude.  Yeah.  What is it?  Trim Jim.  Trim Jim.  Skinny Jimmy?  Skinny Jimmy. 
[02:52:30]  That does it wrong, shit toes.  Oh, my God.  Stop with your wintergreen gum on your lip.  What are you?  Oh, you're a mouth.  You nervous creep.  Did he try to blow a bubble?  He certainly did.  Skinny Jimmy cluffing his leg all over his lower lip.  And tucking those goddamn pajamas.  He was all confident.  You're a mess.  He's giving the answer, blowing a bubble at the same time.  Bubbles ends up all over his face.  Trim Jim.  Skinny Jimmy was a pretty good guess, though.  No, it wasn't.  It doesn't rhyme. 
[02:53:00]  But he tried.  He's a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He's busy over there.  Rifling through things and misplacing everything.  Well.  Take a break.  We got a couple coming in through the instant feedback.  Yes, I saw a few of those.  Long Island Cop G.  His wordy-gurdy.  Kicking a female in the groin.  Kicking a female in the groin.  Kicking a female in the groin. 
[02:53:30]  Chick kick.  Ah, that's it.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  Okay.  Any suggestions, Hawk?  Yeah.  No?  How about gal boot?  Dweezler from somewhere in California.  Bug on Patrice O'Neill.  A bug on Patrice O'Neill.  Well, I know they sometimes call bugs chiggers.  Well, that's a type of bug. 
[02:54:00]  But that's kind of a reach.  You got it?  Oh.  Yeah, boy.  There's a lot of those.  God, you guys are so fucking unoriginal.  John from Your Mom's Box.  Here's a wordy-gurdy for you.  What you're doing right now sucks.  What we're doing right now sucks.  Okay, wait. 
[02:54:30]  What's his name?  Killer Filler?  Well, he doesn't use the wordy-gurdy format, but his answer is, this bit is shit.  What's his name?  John Finberg.  Finberg.  Let's go to Poconos.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Frank?  How about a bulimic soccer patty?  I don't know.  Persian Virgin. 
[02:55:00]  Virgin Virgin.  Oh, and then he goes, oh.  All right.  Santa Claus, we'll end with you.  What do you have?  Chest log.  Chest log.  Ah.  Chest log.  400?  I'm not asking for prices.  Playing wordy-gurdy, Jimmy.  Oh.  Slipped out.  Chest log.  Oh, tit shit.  Shitty titty. 
[02:55:30]  Very good.  Well.  He ain't got it.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day, boys.  Bye, mister.  Hi, this is Jay Moore, and I'm supposed to say something witty and funny here.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and suck it.  I can't do these, Steve.  Who else does the master poem impressions?  Maybe everyone should step forward.  Everybody.  Who does a master poem impression?  All the interns.  The interns?  Yeah.  All the interns do one.  Who else does one?  Who wants to step up to the mic and do their master poem impressions?  Steve does probably the best one I've heard. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, really?  Out of everybody so far.  Yeah.  Oh, there's Poe.  You can't be in here.  I don't give a shit.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  First of all, Poe does not walk.  Poe moseys.  Right.  That's true.  I've seen it.  He's got a walk that sort of, he's got both hands out like this sometimes, and he'll put  one leg, sort of bow-legged out in front of the other, and walk, you know, sort of like 
[02:56:30]  this.  Yeah.  It's good visual.  It's almost like a keep on trucking walk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very, yeah.  That's accurate.  That's very accurate.  And, um, let's see, I need someone.  Eric, stand right here.  So say you're in a room.  Uh-huh.  When Poe walks into a room, he seeks out the person that might physically be the biggest  threat, and he walks up to them, folds his arm, puts one leg in front of theirs, and goes  like this.  Like to, as to block the guy off.  As to block the guy off. 
[02:57:00]  Uh-huh.  He does like a genie pose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Genie pose with the arms folded, and his shoulder is now against the threat's chest.  Steve does some good radio descriptions, though, and he does this.  And he does this.  Look.  Sorry.  I apologize.  Yeah, he folds his arm in sort of a genie pose.  Then, oh yeah, Poe loves hot chocolate.  We didn't know this.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Big hot chocolate fan, Poe.  When Poe first got here, he was enamored with the hot chocolate so much that he described 
[02:57:30]  it as phenomenal.  Gentlemen, you had that hot chocolate?  Yeah, the hot chocolate here is phenomenal.  Let me get you some.  You know, so when...  Every guest.  Every guest.  So, the guests are all treated to a warm cup of hot chocolate.  Let's see.  The hot chocolate, there's this.  Walking into a room...  Oh, well, the greeting that most people get is the fists together and the oos. 
[02:58:00]  So, when...  I don't know what the fuck that means.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's a respect term.  It's a what?  It's a respect term.  Oh, it's a respect term?  Okay.  I see him doing it every once in a while.  I don't really know what it means.  I think it's a martial arts thing.  So, the fist in front of him, and then he just bends slightly forward.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Now, give me an answer to this.  All right.  Poe?  Thanks, man.  I'll see you.  Yes, Anthony.  I'll see you Monday.  Anthony, have a good weekend.  Anthony.  That is like a great Poe voice, man. 
[02:58:30]  That's really good.  He gives the fist.  Have a good weekend.  Yeah.  Have a good weekend, gentlemen.  I love it.  There's the...  Oh, there's one.  I'm missing something.  I am missing something.  Yeah, it's going to be your teeth in a second.  Look at Poe.  He's not going to do it.  He's giggling.  Look at him.  He's enjoying this, because I've actually...  I studied this.  Oh, and I party rock.  That's pretty good.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, and I party rock.  Oh, what am I missing?  The battle cry of last night.  Shows karate movies now, but that's not really an impression. 
[02:59:00]  He's always training...  Oh, he's always training Mars in the other room.  He's always showing Mars how to do a death grip on somebody.  Masolino, allow me to show you this new takedown move I have perfected in one night.  You could kill somebody with this paper clip.  Allow me to show you how to defend yourself against a nun with a frying pan with this paper  clip.  You know, the most innocuous of threats, apparently, can be dissolved with a piece of paper folded  in three.  Yeah, he was telling us that one.  You could kill someone with a piece of paper.  He certainly wouldn't challenge him on it. 
[02:59:30]  And, yeah, that's the mosey, the talk, the...  You got it down pretty good, Steve.  Yeah.  You know what?  It's just, you know, he's a very...  Oh, that's it.  The Buddha laugh.  Po laughs like a wise old Buddha sensei, like a ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  That's how Po laughs.  You can hear it across the room.  Yeah, yeah.  When Po is amused by something, it's ha-ha-ha, silly human, you know.  Very good.  And that's how...  And that's... 
[03:00:00]  Steve, very, very good.  You've studied.  Yes.  Enjoy that.  Now I'm looking forward to seeing what Po does when he punches a change per stomach.  Po loves me.  Of course.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock! 
[03:00:30]  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  NHL game, play-by-play on XM.

[03:02:00]  FIFA.  World Cup 2006.  32 countries.  31 days.  One champion.  And only on XM Satellite Radio.  World Cup 2006 today.  Hello, soccer fans.  This is Andres Cantor with a World Cup update.  Japan has a legendary coach and former Brazilian superstar, Zico,  who before coaching the Japanese team, played his last years in the J League.  He's very well respected in that country.  And even though his team has not been playing well in the last friendly matches, 
[03:02:30]  he is very confident about his team chances at the World Cup.  We could reach the semifinals,  but beating Australia in our first game could be crucial.  This was Andres Cantor with a World Cup update.  Tune to XM 148 for World Cup this week, each Friday at 9 a.m. Eastern and Saturday at 8 a.m. Eastern.  And coming in June, follow the play-by-play action in English on FIFA World Cup 148 and in Espanol and Deportivo XM 147.  Listen large.  Plumbing problems can be very expensive. 
[03:03:00]  I'm Amy Flitas with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute.  Don't want to watch your money go down the drain?  Then watch out for what one expert calls the number one clogger of commercial toilets, the cell phone.  Given their ever-shrinking size, a clumsy caller may easily drop their phone in your toilet bowl and be unable to retrieve it.  Decorative items placed on the back of a toilet tank may be the second-worst clogger.  The reason?  Often guests or small children may knock decorative items off the toilet tank and into the bowl, 
[03:03:30]  and then be too embarrassed to tell you what's happened.  The result is an eventual mess that may require you to call a plumber and possibly write a very large check.  So experts recommend keeping the top of your toilet tank clear.  For more on this and other personal finance issues, visit Bankrate.com.  I'm Amy Flitas.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:04:00]  Did I just fart?  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Where'd you get those?  I don't know.  I, you know.  Why don't I have Sandy Cain?  No, no, no.  I asked for these.  I need them, too.  No, no, no.  I need them, too, on plate four.  You don't get to play the Sandy Cain.  I need Sandy Cain.  I mean, I've always used the Sandy Cain.  Nope, I stole them from you.  No, I will have Sandy Cain.  I stole them in the settlement, my friend.  Eh, eh, eh.  Look what I get to do now.  Eh, right?  You don't get to do this anymore. 
[03:04:30]  I want the Sandy Cain.  Then trade me something, like last time.  I need Sandy Cain.  You got plenty of fine sound effects.  No, no, no.  Don't unplug my...  You're acting like a child.  Just unplugged his machine.  You're the worst.  Warning, warning, warning.  You're unplugging your machine.  Now I'll play.  You will be molested.  You're acting like a kid.  This is not stupid.  There's no way to go through life, son.  Put a sock on it, boy. 
[03:05:00]  Or else you'll be out of here like shit through a goose.  Then, as of this moment, they're on double secret probation.  Oh, yeah, now look what I do now.  Oh!  You'll get your chance, smart guy.  Ow!  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Ow!  Hello, exactly!  Ow!  You have something to say.  I have something to say.  All right, so let's just talk.  Oh, ow!  This is a giant cock.  Ow!  That one worked.  Wait, do this is a giant cock again. 
[03:05:30]  This is a giant cock.  Ow!  Can you do it again?  This is a giant cock.  Ow!  Ow!  I love when things just work without planning it.  Ow!  I don't believe!  I don't believe!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I absolutely need the Sandy Kane clips.  Are you ready?  Those are community sounds. 
[03:06:00]  I had had them.  I had worked with them.  I knew where they fit for many, many years.  I absolutely need them right above.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.  On plate four.  No.  Oh.  No, you will not get them.  Absolutely.  Why wouldn't I have Sandy Kane?  Because these are mine.  Well, they used to be mine.  Used to.  That isn't a new clip.  They used to be yours.  All right.  Where's something you exclusively play?  Oh, ow!  I'll just grab that. 
[03:06:30]  Well.  Something you've done for years in this show that we do.  All right.  If you want to start just pushing buttons randomly, you're more than welcome.  I need Sandy Kane's sound clip.  I believe I am best qualified to use the Sandy Kane clips.  I've worked for many years with these clips.  I feel I am in a position to use the Sandy Kane clips. 
[03:07:00]  And I...  Thank you.  Thank you.  These clips have...  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  The responsibility for using...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The responsibility for using these clips should be in my hands. 
[03:07:30]  So, PJ, what's up, buddy?  Sorry.  I just liked that I came in and sent him off.  Yeah, Sandy Kane touches herself down there with the vaginal wart.  And then she comes over like she wants to shake your hand or something.  I always felt like I had to be isolated from any of the guests that came in.  Yeah, can I play a little something?  Yeah, the aviator's over there for sure.  Yeah.  Let me just play it.  Oh, it's long, though.  What is it?  Huh?  We'll play it real fast.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much. 
[03:08:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:08:30]  Thank you. 
[03:09:00]  Oh my god!  Amy!  Amy!  Amy!  It's an adult.  I don't play it.  My son!  I don't play it.  Sit in the chair.  I play it, I play it.  Ooh, ooh!  Oh, sit in the chair.  Hey, hey! 
[03:09:30]  Ow!  Ooh, hey, hey!  Ow!  Ow!  Hey!  Thanks!  Wah, ew!  Ooh, ow!  Ow, ooh, ooh!  Oh, ow!  Ew!  I'm, hey, I don't know.  I don't play it.  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  Ah, that's great.  She was a mess, man.  She's like an old peep show girl that we used to have on our show. 
[03:10:00]  All those noises came from her.  I don't know why you're scared of her.  I don't know how you can't touch that.  I would mount that in a second.  That line is hilarious.  Some of the reasons she was making those sounds is a story unto itself.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Get her done.  All right.  Guys, just when you thought the bit was dead.  Yeah.  We got some good Dickie Goodmans that came in.  Yes.  We were ready to bail on this, but you need a few people to step up and get what it's all about. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  Embrace the spirit of the bit.  Good old Dickie Goodman came up with these hack songs.  I guess they were comedy bits.  Like little comedy bits, yeah, that used songs of the day, whatever song was popular at the time he did them.  Did one on Watergate.  On Jaws.  Jaws was, I think, his most famous one.  Yeah.  Where he would play the news reporter in all of these things.  And he would ask questions like a news reporter would, but the answers are supplied by musical lyrics. 
[03:11:00]  That's right.  Right.  Who thought this would be a good idea?  Dickie Goodman.  The songs were all over the radio at the time.  Yeah.  And eventually Dickie Goodman took a bullet to the head.  Yeah.  When Dickie finally looked back on his career in a moment of clarity and saw what it amounted to,  he thought the only resolution for him was to take a gun, put it to his head, and pull the trigger. 
[03:11:30]  Yes.  Well, we have three new ones that came in.  Three new ones.  We start with P-Niggity.  All right.  His is entitled Bitch Whore Chef.  Oh, I can see where this one's going.  Wonderful.  Thank you, Bill Burr.  We are here in the servants' quarters of the Kumia Mansion, speaking with Anthony's whore-bitch chef.  Hello, whore-bitch chef.  Hello, hello.  Can you give us an example of a meal you might cook for Mr. Kumia? 
[03:12:00]  A bigger pizza pie.  What does Anthony eat for breakfast?  Candy.  Whore-bitch chef, how do you respond to Bill Burr's allegation of an affair between yourself and Mr. Kumia?  Life, life, life, yeah.  Well, I guess that settles that.  Here comes Mr. Kumia now.  Mr. Kumia, do you think I have a future in radio?  It can happen to you.  Do you really think so?  I don't think so.  Mr. Kumia, do you have any advice for me?  Run to the hills. 
[03:12:30]  Mr. Kumia, what are you doing with that shotgun?  This record wasn't supposed to end this way.  See?  There you go.  Short, sweet.  He did the voice right.  That's what we're looking for right there.  That's it.  That's a great example.  Topical.  Topical.  Has something to do with the show.  The songs made sense to the questions he was asking.  Yeah.  See, people?  It can be done.  That's right.  The next one came in from Snapman from Whackbag. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  And I don't like this one.  You don't like this one?  I don't like this one.  Why?  What's it entitled?  Interview with Opie.  All right.  I can see why you don't like it already.  I don't really like this one.  I'm here with Greg Opie Hughes from the Opie and Anthony show.  Say, Opie, what's that cereal you're eating?  Lean on me.  Is there any other cereal you like to eat?  And how do those cereals make you feel?  I feel pretty and pretty and gay.  Opie, you often rollerblade around Central Park. 
[03:13:30]  What do you do when you take off your rollerblades?  We're sanders.  Opie, you seem like a really tough person.  But is there anyone who made you run and hide like a little girl?  Opie, you have a pretty young girlfriend.  Just how old is she?  She's only 17.  And why is she going out with you?  Money.  That's all the time we have for today.  What did you think of the interview, Opie?  I want to kill you.  I want to blow you away. 
[03:14:00]  Well, in that case, I'm going to run and hide like a little girl.  There you go.  All right.  That's very funny.  That's Snap Man from Whack Bag.  Excellent.  Actually, another great example of what we're looking for as far as these Dickie Goodman bits go.  The voice.  Great.  I think this bit might survive for a little longer after all.  And then the third one that came in overnight is from Anthony's brother Joe.  Brother Joe threw one together.  Look at that.  Earning his money.  He did one on Andrea Yates. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  This one.  Suggested this.  Is brutal.  Strap in, kids.  This one is brutal.  Good evening.  I'm here taking a dump in the Yates bathroom with Andrea and her five little fuck-ups at bath time.  Hey, little Yateses.  What's going on here?  Splish, splash. 
[03:15:00]  I was taking a bail.  Mrs. Yates, you crazy cunt.  What was that you're just whispering in your daughter's ear?  Got you in a strange world, baby.  Hey, little Yates girl.  Where are you going in that tub of death?  Down, down, down, down, down.  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  I couldn't hear you with all that water in your little lungs.  I'm going down, down, down, down, down.  Mrs. Yates, we know you're nuttier than a shit after eating 25 Snickers bars, but what do you think your children are? 
[03:15:30]  Three little fishies in a itty-bitty pool.  Mrs. Yates, what are your children's names?  Sully, Jenny, Disco Bevel, and Boopy Doopy Doop.  Don't you realize they're the fruit of your loins?  Three little fishes and the mama fishie, too.  Uh-oh.  The little Yates boy isn't looking so good.  What's that coming out of his nose?  Oh, my God.  Andrea, I notice you're using a very gentle shampoo on their little heads.  Is that Johnson & Johnson's... 
[03:16:00]  Well, in that case, maybe you're not the worst mother in the world.  Hey, little baby Yates, how did you feel as mommy squeezed the last bit of life out of your tiny defenseless body?  First, I was afraid.  I was petrified.  Andrea, you kooky, homicidal twat.  How come you showed less emotion through this whole ordeal than an Asian hooker?  Well, Mrs. Yates, you've finally done it and all five of your children are dead.  What are you going to do when their dad comes home? 
[03:16:30]  Thank you for allowing me to take a shit in your den of death, Mrs. Yates.  Any final words before I wipe my ass and get the fuck out of here?  Well, that's it.  Till next time, Dickie Goodman, with no comedy on my mind and a big fucking bullet hole in my head.  Oh, my God.  Okay, terrific.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:17:00]  And, of course...  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was brutal.  I don't remember Dickie cursing so much in his songs.  No.  I never played on, like, WNBC.  Reporters are usually a little straight.  Like, they're kind of straight men.  Reporters don't commentate about what this shit might look like after X amount of name-brand candy bars. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  This book...  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  Oh, this book is funny.  What happened?  What are you thumbing through, Jimmy?  It's a book called Sinful Nims.  Sinful Nims.  Sinful Nims.  Well, what a coincidence.  You're enjoying the book, and I believe the author is going to call in today.  It's a scintillating collection of hilarious adult acronyms.  Is that happening today?  Yes, at 8.15. 
[03:18:00]  It's scintillating, but sin, S-I-N, and scintillating is, like, slanted, so it kind of leaps out at you.  Mm-hmm.  And there's, like...  Uh...  Let's see...  Uh...  Let me find a word.  Uh...  If.  The word if.  If.  If.  Stands for I'm fucked.  All right.  And there's a cartoon, though.  Uh-huh.  It's a guy looking at two larger gentlemen in a prison. 
[03:18:30]  Shower.  Oh!  Oh, so...  This is a good one.  It says...  Mate.  Munch a twat every day.  That's mate.  And it's got a cartoon of a gal on her back.  Yeah.  And a man wearing a thing on his neck about to munch her twat.  Like a little thing you'd put around, like a napkin type thing or a bib. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  What is the point of this?  We're going to find out when we interview the author.  You take a word.  Yeah.  And then you take the word's acronym.  Mm-hmm.  And then you make up what it would stand for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, these are hilarious adult acronyms.  And the quote on the back is,  Too naughty, too clever, and just too damn funny to be put down by James Oscar Barrows. 
[03:19:30]  From what publication is that review?  There is none.  There isn't, so it's like his friend.  It's probably his friend, yes.  But there's three names, so that sounds more official.  Wow.  Well, we'll talk to him when he calls.  I just happen to laugh at some of these adults.  Well, it should be a fine interview.  That's coming up at 8.15 on the Opium Ethnic Program.  This interview would normally be done on a Wednesday, I think, right?  But today is Thursday.  Years ago, we would have done this on a Wednesday.  Yeah.  But today is...  Okay, do it today.  I can't even understand what he's saying. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know.  He's whispering secret codes to us.  What?  We can't read lips.  I said, do you want to blowjob?  Shut up.  Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep.  Let's go to John in Utah.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, there's another Dickie Goodman song, Christmas one,  that I heard on the weird Christmas channel you guys got here.  Are you kidding?  An interview with Santa.  You guys got to hunt that one down.  An interview with Santa. 
[03:20:30]  Hawks on it.  It's traditionally, it's a traditional Dickie Goodman horrible wreck,  but you guys got to have that too.  I had no idea that there was a...  Yeah, there's a Christmas one.  A Christmas one.  We're looking for it right now.  All right, punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Santa and the Satellite?  Santa, there's a few of them.  Oh, Dickie Goodman?  Santa and the Touchables?  Want to just try one of these, see what it sounds like?  I don't know. 
[03:21:00]  Try the first one, I guess.  This book is the worst.  No, it's going to be good.  It's going to be good at 815, Anthony.  It's going to be good.  Let's play this real fast.  We interrupt this record for an important news bulletin.  Santa Claus is missing from the North Pole.  Be on the lookout for Santa Claus.  Last scene.  Sitting in la-la, waiting for my ya-ya.  Washington has decided this is a job for the Touchables. 
[03:21:30]  The summer 1961, at the headquarters of Elliot Press and the Touchables.  Take the hall with bouts of honey.  Ba-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Sent to the North Pole, the Touchables learn that someone has launched a toy spaceship, sending Santa to the moon.  Alvin the Chipmunk says...  Hey!  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer volunteers to lead the Touchables to the rescue.  A new spaceship is ready for blast-off.  D-minus three, two, one, zero.  Okay, Alvin?  Alvin? 
[03:22:00]  Chipmunks.  Chipmunks are always funny.  Alvin!  Alvin!  Successfully landing on the moon, Rudolph and the Touchables are surrounded by the moon men.  Hey, hey, hey, whoa, hey, hey, ho.  The leader of the moon men approaches Elliot Press and says...  Get, get, get, get, wher-wher-wher-wher-wher-pum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m.  Ah, I get it.  Which translated means...  Hit the road, yeah.  Don't you come back no more.  But the Touchables are not leaving without Santa Claus. 
[03:22:30]  After a brief battle, Elliot Press looks up and says...  I'll be back on my feet someday.  Meanwhile, Rudolph secretly leads Santa Claus to the spaceship.  Out of gas, the Touchables Hines Rudolph to the ship, and away they go.  Watch out!  There we go again.  When was this made, 1950?  That was in the 60s?  That is awful.  That is so bad.  That's actually the song on Anthony's MySpace page.  It is not.  It is. 
[03:23:00]  And I would tell anybody, go and see that it is not.  All right, go ahead.  C-U-M-M-I-A, call me a...  No.  Jim Norton.  You are really trying to undermine me.  I'm not.  Listen, let's get...  My efforts.  You're very famous.  That is awful.  That is really, really bad.  Our listeners are coming up with better ones.  Were they for kids, though?  Was that a kids one or no?  Like for Alvin and the Chipmunks?  No.  It was for retards.  People, adults liked Alvin and the Chipmunks back then.  They're cute.  Well, there's another one. 
[03:23:30]  There's another Christmas one.  Maybe this is the one he was talking about.  The Touchables.  Hit it.  Here is a news bulletin.  Santa Claus has been kidnapped by spacemen from a flying saucer, which landed at the  North Pole.  Be on the lookout for Santa Claus.  It's the same one, right?  You play that same one again, Hawk, and I'll smash that monitor off your teeth.  No, it's...  He didn't...  It's listed differently.  You tell him to fix it.  It's listed like it could be a different one.  Fix it.  No, we don't.  It's not.  But it's not as right.  The Touchables just standing on a bunch of kids. 
[03:24:00]  How awful is that?  That guy made a career off of doing that.  And then realized that and took a bullet to the head.  Blew his head off.  That's so great.  Wonder what little soundtrack he was listening to when that bullet ripped his brains all  over the wall.  What a justified...  Wait, there's one for...  Killing.  There's one for Kong.  And now with the new movie coming out, this is topical.  This came out in the 70s.  Oh, when the remake was made, I guess?  Oh, boy.  This has got to be really bad.  Strap in, kids.  Oh, I can't take this.  I probably will not be able to handle this. 
[03:24:30]  Ah, there's a giant monkey running loose, and look what he's saying.  Here we go.  We're here on Skull Island, where a 40-foot gorilla has just kidnapped Juan, a young actress.  Hey, Kong, what did you tell her?  And what did she say to you?  When do you intend to let her go? 
[03:25:00]  Juan, if you can hear me up there, what advice do you have for someone who was kidnapped by  a 40-foot gorilla?  Thank you, Juan.  Juan, okay.  Kong, you're going to New York to do a concert.  While you're there, where are you going to take a bath?  At the car wash.  One last question before you go.  Oh, my God.  What do you call that weird way you walk?  We are here in New York, where the stadium is filled. 
[03:25:30]  Kong, what do you feel like with all these people around?  Just a lover, new kid and dog.  Oh, oh, stop.  Kong is breaking loose.  He doesn't want to do the concert.  Juan, say something to him.  You don't have to be a star, baby.  He's heading for the World Trade Center.  We'll have to get help to stop this monkey.  Hot run, hot run. 
[03:26:00]  Calling up a hot run.  Kong has reached the Trade Center.  He's climbing to the top.  Kong, what are you doing up there?  Why do something nasty on the wall?  We are here with Kong on top of the World Trade Center.  Army helicopters are shooting at him.  Unfortunately, he wasn't up there on September 11th.  Kong is shouting something up at them.  Hand me down my walk, you can't hand me down my hand.  Tragedy is Dickie Goodman is killed.  Kong, have you any last words to say to Juan?  Where will I hold you again? 
[03:26:30]  He's starting to fall.  Hey, Kong, you're on my foot.  We're falling.  Kong!  The record wasn't supposed to end this way.  Kong!  Oh, he's falling.  Jeez, gonna do it all day.  Holy cow.  That was, I can't even say it anymore. 
[03:27:00]  How bad.  He actually handed that in to somebody.  Hey, what is this against my temple?  It's a Luger.  Oh, my God.  Wow, am I glad he shot himself.  Oh, I couldn't be happier at someone's suicide.  You know what?  With the new Kong movie coming out, we should take the original Dickie Goodman.  Yeah.  And we'll rework the clips.  Oh, of course.  The song clips.  We'll make it better.  That could be really good. 
[03:27:30]  I wonder if his family, what they said when they shot himself, they're probably all secretly relieved.  He's like, ah, we don't have to sit around and awkwardly smile at these.  Thank God.  Awkwardly smile.  I have a new one.  Here it is, family.  And there he is.  Pops in the tape and they all go, huh?  And they wouldn't even, it was so unfunny.  They'd say things like, I like that song.  I like that song.  That part with the, um, when you were falling, I really got the image that you were falling.  And it made me so fucking happy. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, no.  Something is spilled on my floor.  It's brain matter.  Yeah, we could do one on Dickie Goodman.  Oh, that's great.  Bullet in the head.  Right.  Sure.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Yeah, hey.  Shot to the heart.  No, it's to his head.  It didn't matter.  It's his shot.  There's very few songs that say, uh.  Shot to the head.  Unfunny man kills himself.  Hit me with your best shot.  Yep. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, man, we might have to work today and put this thing together.  Let's make it.  Let's make a song, boys.  Why don't we open it up to the listeners?  Like we always do.  Yeah, we're just idea men.  And then you guys take it and run.  Let's make a record.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, there's one of those Dickie Goodman ones that he did about the oil crisis also.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  The big oil crisis?  He was just a hit in the 70s, wasn't he?  Yeah, because the interview was with like King Faisal and Golda Meir and somebody else. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, all the relevant topical people from 1974.  Let me ask you, Dickie, when did he shoot himself?  I believe it was in the 80s.  I don't think we, I think we can just answer that question by listening to this music.  Yeah, no kidding.  No, no, not why, but when.  I'm saying like, what, did he try a hit in the 80s?  People were so into Wall Street and doing coke, they're like, look, you irrelevant douchebag.  Just fucking drop that around.  Yeah, what was his last song that he really tried to, uh, something with Reagan? 
[03:29:30]  I think there was one in the 80s, but I'm not positive.  But the 70s channel played these damn things all the time.  Well, they were huge in the 70s.  Yeah, they were very popular.  When they were doing It, you know, the decade run-through, I think they played like 10 or 15 of them.  Oh, wow.  Can we get a Dickie Goodman CD?  There has to be a Greatest Hits.  Yeah, boys.  All right, thank you.  You think he had dreams of a box set?  He didn't know what that was, but he knew he wanted greatness beyond what he would reach. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Guy in...  His dream was a pine box set.  Yes.  I just want to be awarded a satin pillow.  Guy in Connecticut.  Head like a hole.  Yeah.  Like nine-inch nails.  Head like a hole.  Let's see what the listeners could come up with first.  That's a good one.  And then if they don't do a good job, then we'll go into the production room and actually work.  All right, thank you, Guy.  No problem.  And then they're saying there's, uh, this one that he came up with.  Tim?  Yo.  Hey. 
[03:30:30]  What's up?  Hey, um, I remember a song back in the 80s, around the time that E.T., the movie came out.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know if it was Dickie Goodman, but it was somebody that did the Dickie Goodman style.  And one of the lines was, E.T. wants to phone home, but E.T., how do you call outer space?  And then they played the clip of the, uh, Tommy Two-Tone song.  The 8-6-7-5.  Oh, 8-6-7-0-5-3-0-9.  Watch out, boy.  Oh, I wish we got to get that.  I can't find that one either.  Oh.  Uh, there is a Greatest Hits, though. 
[03:31:00]  Two.  Two Greatest Hits.  Two Greatest Hits?  Wow.  One called Greatest Fables by Dickie Goodman.  Ew.  Released in 1997.  Fables.  Fable.  And then The King of Novelty, Greatest Fables.  Fables?  I don't think Aesop shot himself on a linoleum floor.  Volume Two.  He had a Volume Two, everyone.  Volume Two.  Is there a track listing for these, uh?  There's gotta be a way to get these online.  Uh, let's see the track listing. 
[03:31:30]  A little more Dickie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my.  Are you kidding me?  What?  Sweetie, what?  How many songs are there?  All right, wait, go back.  There's like 30 of them.  Return of the Flying Saucer, Flying Saucer Part One, Flying Saucer Part Two, Flying Saucer  the Second, Flying Saucer the Third, Flying Saucer Goes West.  It was a biggie.  Santa and the Satellite, Santa and the Satellite Part Two, Santa and the Touchables.  So those are all different songs, by the way.  The Touchables, the Touchables in Brooklyn, Ben Crazy, Batman and His Grandmother, The Ride 
[03:32:00]  of Paul Revere, Frankenstein of 59, Frankenstein Returns, Get a Job on Campus, Luna Trip,  Watergate, Mr. President, Energy Crisis, Mr. Jaws, go down.  Holy shit, there's 40 tracks on this thing.  It goes on and on.  40 tracks, no laughs.  Super Superman, Return of the Jedi Returns, Hey E.T., Attack of the Z Monster, Election  84, and horror movies. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  And Safe Sex Report.  Wow, someone's got to get this and go through some of these.  And then after the last track, like they did on Elvis' Last Life CD, they have the, when  Vern came on and made the speech.  Thank you for listening.  That was the last recording of my son Elvis.  I hope that's how Dickie Goodman's ends.  Maybe his wife or bereaved child comes on.  Wow.  Embarrassed child.  That was my daddy.  Why?  You want to hear Ben crazy?  I don't even.  Oh, you found the rest of them?  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[03:33:00]  Do you have the E.T. one?  Oh, shit.  No.  Hawk?  We have the Energy Crisis 74, though.  That was, want to hear just a piece of this one?  I want to hear all of it.  I'm sure it's good.  I'm having some laughs.  It's too long, though.  We'll play a little bit of this.  Listen.  We are here at the White House for a special report on the Energy Crisis.  We're here.  We're here.  Are you?  I didn't understand.  Why was Kong stepping on his foot and then they fell together?  How did that happen?  I don't know.  And why wouldn't Kong stepping on his foot bring him a little more pain?  And why would it knock him off the building? 
[03:33:30]  Right.  Wouldn't that keep him anchored?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Who are all these people?  Maybe because, I don't know.  All right.  Let's back up there.  Because we've got to hear the we're here again.  We are here at the White House for a special report on the Energy Crisis.  Mr. President, have you any statement?  Mr. President, what really caused the energy crisis?  Smoking in the boys' room.  During the crisis, how much gas will motorists be allowed? 
[03:34:00]  Just enough for the city.  Who do you believe the gas shortage will affect most?  Hello, I'm on wheels.  Mr. President, the crisis must be solved.  What do you intend to do?  Keep on playing those mind games.  I don't get it.  With who now is the head of the Federal Energy Office.  Sir, you hold an important position.  What are your qualifications? 
[03:34:30]  I'm a joker.  I'm a smoker.  I'm a real life.  That's funny.  Mr. President, have you anything to add?  Leave me alone.  Ah, he goes back to that.  Here with me is the new Vice President, Chevy Ford.  Holy shit.  Sir, how would you sum up the gas shortage?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  A new noise.  We have a long-distance call from Saudi Arabia.  King Faisal, is that you?  Hello, it's me. 
[03:35:00]  King Faisal, what are your thoughts when you look out at all those oil wells?  You're beautiful, and you're mine.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I have gold in my ear of Israel on the other phone.  Gold in my ear.  What should I tell her?  Won't you tell her that I love you?  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Charlie Pryde.  Mr. President, have you any added comment?  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Oh, that's funny.  Mr. President, the American people are waiting.  Have you a statement?  I'm on top of the world. 
[03:35:30]  Why?  Why?  What does that mean?  Don't create a ship.  We'd like to continue this record on the energy crisis, but we have just run out of energy.  Hey, that's pretty clever.  That's funny.  That's a clever ending right there.  That's clever.  See, they ran out of energy.  Very clever for 1974.  And you shouldn't quite finish it up.  Why?  What happened?  I thought it should end like, well, we'd like to finish this interview. 
[03:36:00]  You know, that would have been more appropriate.  Guess when you thought the Dickie Goodman story couldn't get any better.  We have Bob in North Carolina with some information.  I was hoping it was Bob Goodman.  Bob?  Bob?  Bob?  We're here with Bob!  Bob?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, I think I remember when I was listening to the Stupid Laugh USA channel that Dickie Goodman's  son, if I'm not mistaken, started making the records like his dad did. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, no.  Hopefully he suffered the same fate.  We didn't hurt dad's business.  There's a proud moment for this kid.  Absolutely.  All right, Bob.  I'm out.  I'm going to follow in your father's footsteps right until you're slumped into the corner of  a wall in a motel alone with brain matter behind you.  Listening to your own unfunny dreck.  The O.P. and Anthony program. 
[03:37:00]  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  That I might have been given a bad break, but I've got an awful lot in the floor.  Thank you.  It was always odd to be compared to one of the greatest players to play the game in Lou Gehrig. 
[03:37:30]  He is arguably one of the top five players ever.  We became tied together by the streak, which was nothing more than an approach to the game.  I was resilient and could play every day.  I never planned to break the record.  I had never given it much thought until the streak reached about 1,500 or 2,000 games.  Once it was that close, the momentum shifted as I received a great amount of support to break the streak.  What began on May 30, 1982, and continues September 6, 1995.  This game is now in the books, and let it be said that No. 8, Tal Ripken Jr., has reached the unreachable...

It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I got something to play for you.  Mom? Mom?  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday? 
[03:40:30]  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes, what about periods?  Do you have periods?  Yes, all women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill?  Yes, I want to know if Susie has periods.  Susie?  Yes, Mom?  Jill wants to know something.  We want, Jill.  Susie, do you have periods? 
[03:41:00]  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between  my legs.  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Miss Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill, your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods.  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  How dumb is this kid?  She should be punched in the face and made to give a Hummer in a gymnasium.  Dude, that's stupid questions. 
[03:41:30]  Dude.  Wait, do you, do you, hi?  Who do you get a period?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Don't you get how smart I am?  What?  She's a slow person asking about periods, and I segged into this.  Are you sure?  Oh, I thought she, I didn't know.  Yes.  I thought it was a little kid.  No.  That wasn't like a daughter talking to?  It's a trainable.  Stop it.  Wow.  They used to be called trainables.  I thought it was like a seven-year-old or something that's being told about periods.  No, this is trainables audio. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, my God.  I love this stuff.  I cannot get enough of this.  I love old 50s sex tapes where they talk about sex, and I love the trainable ones where  it's teaching retards about, well, mentally challenged people, about life, sex, things  like that.  Ready to puke?  What is this one about?  Hi, girls.  Hi, Dad.  What have you girls been talking about?  About periods, Daddy.  Dad, can I ask you something?  Sure, honey.  What is it? 
[03:42:30]  Does that girl have periods?  Yes, Jill.  All women have periods about every four weeks.  But, Dad, men don't have periods, do they?  That's right, honey.  Men do not.  Only women.  Blood from inside a woman's body comes outside from an opening between her legs about every  four weeks.  When I punch her in the face.  It's blood.  Won't it get on my clothes?  No, it won't, because you use a sanitary pad.  A sanitary pad.  Yes, a sanitary pad.  Susie, what's a sanitary pad? 
[03:43:00]  Come on, Jill.  Well, I'll show you.  I'm having my period now.  Let's go into the bathroom.  She should have asked her black friend what's a sanitary pad.  He would have said, yo, man, that's a clean apartment.  We're going into the silly zone.  Here we go.  Hold on, kids.  Blood comes from your mother's body between her legs when I push her down the stairs.  And you know the whole time the father's answering, the 17-year-old, he's just looking at her head 
[03:43:30]  picturing how nice a hanger would look at the end of it.  Unfortunately, blood didn't come out of your mother when you were born.  Conceived.  What an idiot I am.  That's all right.  That's stupid.  You know, it didn't take.  They went with it, though.  Sometimes they just go with it with you.  Oh, big, stupid, hammer-headed sperm cells swimming toward the egg.  Oh, beat up, beat up.  Oh, I beat the whole crew here. 
[03:44:00]  Just clumsily stepping on all the other sperm.  Just caught a wave.  Pushed it up forward.  Pushed it in front of everybody.  Well, I'm in the lead.  Hey, what's in here?  The miracle.  Please.  Wonderful.  Want to hear more?  Dopey moe haircut on the sperm.  Oh, big, fat tongue hanging out. 
[03:44:30]  Wiggling its way through that egg.  Oh, I made it.  There's some Einstein one just comes in second.  Oh, life.  Fuck it.  That would make a great fucking shirt.  Yeah.  Life.  Life dot, dot, dot.  Fuck it.  That dumb sperm shows up and the egg is trying to avoid eye contact.  Like, maybe if I just look down, a little stupid won't latch on.  Please, too stupid to figure out how to get in here.  There it is.  And then years later you get, 
[03:45:00]  Eh, do you get a period, Dad?  No, you dummy.  No.  No, that's when I disappear for four days.  Yeah.  And go hunting with the boys.  Every four weeks.  Big, dopey, flat-headed sperm.  Oh.  Well, we have more.  Oh, please.  I hope so.  This is a sanitary pad.  This is where I keep them.  Look, it is blue on one side, pride on the other. 
[03:45:30]  That's right.  Right all over.  It also has sticky stuff, like glue on the blue side.  See?  It's sticky.  Do you know why it's sticky?  No.  Sticky so the pad will stick to my panties.  Oof.  How about sticking it over your mouth, stupid?  This is hot.  Yeah.  Jesus.  So it sticks to my panties.  Sexy about it.  And you know those panties are nothing sexy.  Big, nasty bloomers.  Big, retard underwears.  Thank God we didn't live back then, man. 
[03:46:00]  Thank God.  They're equal size in the front and the back.  You know, that whole equal amount of material.  Where do I stick them?  Well, between the brown and yellow stain.  That's what it is.  Sure.  One piece of adhesive goes on the front panel.  Oh, any underwear that has a panel to it.  Lose it.  This stick's on the front panel.  Piano.  Yeah, sometimes they put little frilly things on the waistband to make it look sexy. 
[03:46:30]  It ain't working.  Oh, God.  What a mess back then, though.  That's great.  The panties were too big.  The hair down there was making your panties look like you were popping Jiffy Pop popcorn.  And then you got this thing.  The sanitary belt.  Then you got something that sticks in the whole mess.  Yeah.  So you don't bleed into your fucking bloomers.  Yeah, use this belt.  What, my pad?  No, to hang your retarded self with.  The inside of a panties smells like Indonesia two weeks after the tsunami.  Jesus.  How do you use it? 
[03:47:00]  I'm having my period now.  I'll show you how I use it.  You mean the blood's coming from inside your body now?  Yes, from the opening between my legs.  This is a used sanitary pad.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  It looks like jelly.  Oh, man.  That's brutal.  Look, there's blood on it.  See? 
[03:47:30]  That's right.  Blood coming from inside my body through an opening between my legs.  Look closer.  Closer.  No, closer.  That old gag.  Like a pie.  All right, let me have it.  This is a sanitary napkin, Stanley.  Well, let me have it, Ollie.  Indeed, I will let you have it.  Stanley, get a little closer to the sanitary napkin. 
[03:48:00]  What are you going to do with it, Ollie?  I'm going to let you have it.  But I don't think I want it, Ollie.  You said you want it.  Now I'll give it to you.  I hope you enjoyed it, old blood face.  Is that awful? 
[03:48:30]  I've got to hear more of that.  Oh, God.  Awful, awful thing she pulled out.  It must have looked like a red slug with skin tags on it.  Oh, God damn it.  When the pad hits much blood on it, it's a good time to change it.  I'll show you how I change it.  Yeah.  Watch carefully, okay? 
[03:49:00]  See how the pad sticks to my panties?  See?  I fold it over.  Now I wrap it up.  This way it won't make any mess.  Now I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Like Daddy and Mommy made.  I do not put it in the toilet.  Mess.  I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Now I take the clean pad.  See?  See, Joe?  Blue.  White.  See?  That's there.  So the pad will stick to panties. 
[03:49:30]  See how it sticks to my panties?  Can't she just rip her uterus out?  Yes.  That's all there is to it.  That's all there is to it.  Bingo.  Wow.  That is brutal.  There's a film with this?  How much does she show?  Actually, this came from Nathaniel, right?  Does she show any sninging?  Ah, Nathaniel.  What a find, my friend.  Nice job.  Wow.  We love these.  This beats the crap out of the Danny fetus story.  He's flipping me the bird. 
[03:50:00]  Is this online or is this actually a home video?  To his sister, Jill.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  Is it a video?  Uh, yes.  One that I definitely found on my own and was not sent in by a listener.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm better than Danny.  Thank you.  Of course you are.  I would love to see.  Do they show any?  Yeah.  Is the older sister showing the snatch?  No.  Oh, damn it.  She's wearing one of those old long skirt kind of things.  Oh, so she takes her panties off under the skirt and kind of. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, but I'll let Opie play the next clip, but they do show what they're talking about  in the next clip.  Oh, they do?  Not, nothing, no.  When she takes her panties off under the skirt, does it look like the elevator in The  Shining?  Wow.  That old blood fountain gash.  Great trainable, isn't she?  And she's a slow one, huh?  You ripped your wife's panties off and then you left it crumpled in the hallway.  I don't recollect that at all.  I think I should change my sanitary pad. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, and when do you think you should change your sanitary pad?  As soon as possible.  Well, the next try.  Yes.  The trainable puts a pad on.  Puts a pad on.  Yes.  I'm looking forward to it.  Now you try it.  Let's pretend you're having your period.  Let's make believe that blood is coming out from inside your body through an opening between 
[03:51:30]  your legs now.  Okay, I'll get a pad.  Look, it's blue on one side and white on the other.  That's right.  It's sticky.  It is sticky.  It's sticky, all right.  Like Daddy's tummy.  Sticky because it'll stick to your panties.  Are you ready to put it on now?  Yes.  First I put my panties down.  Oh.  Okay, the pad.  Now what do we do?  Peel off the paper. 
[03:52:00]  Right.  Peel off the paper.  Where are you putting it?  The wastebasket.  The wastebasket.  Okay.  Of course.  Now what are you going to do?  I'm sticking it in my panties.  All right, it's down to your panties.  You placed it on there so it's sticky.  Meanwhile, this dummy is bumbling around the bathroom dripping blood like an Alzar  Cowley beheading video, stumbling around with her awful bloomers pulled down to her ankles. 
[03:52:30]  Where's the pet?  Where's the pet?  How old is Jill, Nathaniel?  Am I on?  I'd estimate about 12.  12?  13.  13 just learning about this?  Yeah, dropping trow in this video.  And is she profoundly retarded?  Because she sounds like you could kind of teach her a thing.  Yeah.  She's about, you know.  It's down syndrome or is she just a...  She's got a pretty big head. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  I was just wondering what type of mental disability she had.  Is she an actress, though?  Playing the part?  What?  Hey, you know.  Julia Lewis was able to pull it off.  You never know.  No, I think she's just a highly trained trainable.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Got to go to the phone real fast.  Taylor in VA, Virginia.  Taylor?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Dude, you guys just made me...  You jerk off and made me spray coffee all over my windshield with the fucking...  You know, I'm on my period now.  Let me show you.  Fucking disgusting. 
[03:53:30]  This is the worst.  Did you see me sitting there massaging a rod?  No, dude.  I'm packing like a half right now.  Eric wants to know if this is the sexiest state audition.  Eric from Philly.  Very good.  Back to the tape.  Good job, little smucker's leg.  I drive my hands. 
[03:54:00]  Now I'm all ready.  All ready.  Yeah, I'm all ready.  Jump in front of a bus.  I'm really proud of you.  You wear it for a while for practicing for tennis.  Practice.  Let's go tell mom and dad what I did.  She's got to wear it for practice.  What a...  Sick family.  Yeah, this is a little twisted, man.  You know, one time, dumbbells, you're going to put it on adhesive side up.  Oh.  It's sticky. 
[03:54:30]  She's going to seal herself up and just save the world in a lot of trouble.  You know what you do?  You just wait until they have it in the shower at school and throw tampons at them.  You'll plug it up, plug it up.  This was before tampons, though.  Yeah.  They had to use a lot bigger stuff.  Oh, my God.  Having to teach this girl about a tampon.  Well, she's crying in the bathroom.  You just point at it and go, bad girl.  Oh, dirty.  Dirty girl.  Filthy.  That means you're a whore and Jesus hates you.  That's the devil coming out. 
[03:55:00]  What, you give her a crucifix and put on the exorcist?  You know what to do, stupid.  What else do we have, Opie?  I've got to hear more.  Jill, I have a question for you.  What do you do with the one you take off that has a lot of blood on it?  Fold it over, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest wastebasket.  That's right.  You fold it, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Now I know all women have periods. 
[03:55:30]  Put in the wastebasket.  That's it.  This guy's in hell.  Fold it up and throw it away.  Now the whole bathroom smells like a jar of pennies.  Well, Anthony, I got more.  Sorry, I stepped on you.  Thanks, Nathaniel.  We got trainables saying penis and cock.  Oh!  But first, it's a little bit about sex ed.  Sex ed.  Nice.  You got to train these people.  Yes, Nathaniel?  Sorry.  This whole video, it's like the ABCs of sex for trainables or whatever.  It starts with two minutes of just this trainable walking along a street 
[03:56:00]  and a car pulling up, coaxing her into it, and driving off.  Was it a Saturn?  So I guess this is trying to prevent that sort of thing from happening.  Oh, God, is that great.  And it wasn't a trainable.  It was just Voss walking after his car broke down.  And what year would you say these are made?  These are definitely 60s.  Oh, 60s?  Early or late?  Has to be early. 
[03:56:30]  Early 60s are really close to 50s.  Yeah, it has that 50s sound to it.  Yeah, this one might be a little later than the one from before  because if you hear the soundtrack, it's just sort of this hippie.  A little groovy?  Like, I believe it was by the Lake Springs.  Great, and then your pad will look like a tie-dyed shirt.  You tool.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  She spilled my chips.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, okay.
