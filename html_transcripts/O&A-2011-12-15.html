<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts joking about their fatigue before launching into a graphic description of a woman's death in a malfunctioning New York City elevator.  They recounted the gruesome details, speculated on the cause, and shared their own near-death elevator experiences.  A listener corrected their misconception about surviving a falling elevator.  The hosts then discussed the impact of the accident on their elevator-phobic coworker, Ronnie, before veering into absurd hypotheticals about using elevators as time machines.  They returned to the accident, vividly describing the trauma of the witnesses, and then discussed other elevator mishaps, including playing a 911 call recording from an incident involving trapped schoolgirls. An Otis elevator mechanic called in to explain the likely technical malfunction responsible for the initial fatality. The conversation transitioned to a discussion of various phobias, including heights.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to a recap of a fight between former producer Billy Staples and the producers of the Ron and Fez show.  The hosts detailed the reasons for the argument, focusing on Staples’ claims of being the best producer ever and his comments about his daughter. They shared anecdotes about Staples, including his own apparent fear of elevators and a past fall down some stairs.

The show then shifted to complaints about cable companies, transitioning into a barrage of political commentary. A caller, Chris, complained about cable TV interfaces before abruptly hanging up.  The hosts then discussed Herman Cain's presidential candidacy, playing a clip of a Barbara Walters interview highlighting his foreign policy struggles. They criticized MSNBC's perceived bias, comparing it to Fox News in highly offensive terms.  Further political discussion ensued, targeting Mitt Romney, the KKK, Reverend Al Sharpton's MSNBC appearances, and a police officer shooting, with the hosts blaming a judge's leniency. They also touched on President Obama's "fair share" tax comments, the super committee's failure, the Keystone pipeline, Howard Stern's new role on *America's Got Talent* (and related rumors and a potential lawsuit), and the ongoing dispute between Ron & Fez and their producer, Billy Staples.  The segment was rife with vulgar and offensive language.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of topics.  It started with a graphic description of a physical altercation between female employees, including comments about one woman's physique and past work as a "butt model." This segued into a nonsensical debate about Latina and Caribbean nationalities, followed by a review of comments on a video regarding one host's weight.  The discussion returned to the "butt model," with sexually suggestive comments and relationship speculation.  A heated argument erupted between the hosts and producers, specifically about which past producer—Billy Staples or the current producers Hicks and Zito—was superior. This escalated into a shouting match with accusations, insults (including homophobic slurs), and threats of banning a producer. The argument involved criticisms of the producers' work ethic and contributions, punctuated by sexually suggestive remarks and insults. A caller chimed in on the conflict. The show then touched upon a recent elevator accident, a producer's unusual pre-entry building circling habit, a brief call from a hockey player, criticism of a *Mission Impossible* movie's portrayal of villains, a vulgar and extended critique of a *Rocky IV* scene, a coworker's recent gun purchase (including details of the firearm and the coworker's relationship with a police officer), more arguments between hosts and producers, and further discussion of the show's internal dynamics.  Comedian Joe DeRosa called in, discussing his recent performance at Caroline's Comedy Club and his drinking habits.  Finally, the show discussed intern Matt's performance and the reasons for his unpopularity among staff, including a brief (initially muted) on-air interview with Matt. The entire excerpt was filled with vulgar language, sexually suggestive content, personal attacks, and constant interruptions.

A significant segment focused on intern Matt's perceived lack of work ethic, desire for airtime, and relationships with other staff members, including Sal, Danny, and E-Rock.  Other staff expressed jealousy and dislike, citing his perceived arrogance and lack of contribution.  Matt's future plans and past experiences were discussed amidst personal insults and vulgar language. Roland was mentioned, though not present on air.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Matt's departure and commercial breaks for Pajamagram and ProFlowers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road let's do this huh hey good morning  everyone morning morning how we doing today god listen our our energy's up how are we everybody  weren't we all just saying before the mic's on oh god i'm fucking tired i slept but i'm still tired  mics go on and we fake it good don't we yeah we're the best fakers we already did about 10  i guess we should just turn on the mic soon as everyone gets into the studio 
[00:00:30]  let me start the show on time  well we had an elevator death here in new york it's everyone's worst nightmare well one of them  one of them well getting raped as it happens it's probably worse getting raped as it happens  yeah yeah sure that's a nightmare for the rapist too though you're gonna see that's hard to finish  this is it's everything you think when you get onto another yeah front page of the daily news  her death trap like millions of us susan hart got on an elevator to go to work seconds later she was 
[00:01:00]  dead oh my god who wants to wake up to this today that's terrible i don't want to read this first  thing in the morning oh hi danny morning morning morning morning uh so what happened it was on  madison avenue not too far from here madison avenue and and she uh she was apparently getting into the  elevator yeah and uh the elevator which by the way these elevators have had a history  right of violations right of being creaky shaky and 56 violations they lurch mr adams what's a lurch 
[00:01:30]  when they all of a sudden they just either go up or down real fast or stop real quick  and uh she was getting in she was uh at that critical point where you're half in and half out of the  elevator and the thing decided to shoot up with the door still open and that acts like a guillotine  let's be honest with each other what the fuck are the odds of that you think there was so many  safety systems you're halfway in the doors are still open and it shoots up and what are the odds 
[00:02:00]  very slim almost impossible very almost impossible right this would be happening every day and we  should look into her background because she might be evil no she looks all like a nice enough gal  holy shit why did she looks like a nice enough person everybody i'm sorry to everybody she's  from new york for god's sake i'm sorry the kids were family listening no but i mean what is it that's  a sucks to be you or uh that is a unlucky lottery because the odds of that happening odds of it 
[00:02:30]  happening you have to be halfway in the elevator you have to have an elevator that's all fucked up  to begin with but the door is going to stay open so you can be halfway in you know how many times  this probably happens where you're just getting into the elevator or you're already you just got  in right and then it lurches up and you're like fuck if i would have been in the door and this time  you know she was and what then she uh she was half in half out as it what as it went up so she got  basically she got squeezed between the floor of the elevator and the top of the elevator door jam if 
[00:03:00]  you would want to call it that and uh just squished right in there they said that she had uh  in an instant uh she still had one foot out was pulled up the shaft where she became wedged between  the elevator and the wall so it had a life crushed out of her so it's not uh it's not exactly against  the shaft wall so there's a gap in there but it's not big enough for a person right and she was pulled  into that and just kind of oh my god she's still on a foot out my thing is i've thought of that many 
[00:03:30]  times like uh it says here she's just kind of yanked up with it a fire official said then the  elevator car becomes pinned between the first and second floor it seems like her body is what stopped  the elevator oh my god ah wow that is some fucked up recruitment shit i was getting on yesterday on  this elevator everybody's had their awful elevator and uh i always do we talked about before the show  you put your hand in and you swoop never just get on i let the electric eye pick up that something's 
[00:04:00]  in the way of the door instead of that little like bumper sensor and where your arm would be  caught in the door if it doesn't work i go karate chop yeah you do the karate chop you go yeah  in between the old school like i'm breaking like cinder block yeah that's exactly what i do yeah and  you say yeah yeah it was usually open but this time it didn't open it just closed oh shit i said to  the guy there i'm like what the fuck it's supposed to censor you you have a worse story than this girl  it's almost as tragic but literally if i would have just jumped on an elevator and would have 
[00:04:30]  just went down it could have been mediocre comedian crushed on his way home from what is hell for  everybody you almost lost a hang now in this oh no i would have been half in and out my fucking thank  god my good cock would have stopped the door oh but that's every day you think of that when you  go on an elevator like what if this fucking thing just drags me down oh i always do that's just it i  never think of it i just get in and go ah not not a fan of the elevator because i know if it plummets  i'll jump right at the end and save myself like bugs bunny when he went out of the crashing plane 
[00:05:00]  we all know that works he jumped out and up before it hit and he was fine and then if it uh goes  straight up then uh you're fine too you just end up uh for a second like a pancake on the bottom of  the elevator and then when it reaches the top you go and then you're fine again fucking cartoons  that's where i learned all of my physics you just gotta time it properly yeah but who fucks  around with the threshold i'm sure she wasn't i'm sure i'm sure she was doing the basic getting on  an elevator i've seen plenty of fucking babbling yentas getting in and out of elevators where they're

[00:12:00]  there here's what happens a lot of times in these apartment buildings you get these elevators that  have an actual door like just a knob and a door and you have to open it up and then walk into the  elevator all right and a lot of times there's no elevator there and people are just how do you just  not even look where you're stepping and they step into the darkness and fall down the elevator  shaft i would never do a lot of people die that way there was also um it's like walking into a  dark closet when you just do that yeah i wouldn't there's an instance at a school the other day

[00:15:30]  but the elevator kept coming down star wars pretty much thought that we were going to die  and just get 3po to shut down all the trash compactors under there on the security level on  the detention level my foot was kind of squished like this oh wow they were that close yeah the floor and  elevator may have been what finally caused the car to come to a stop now resting on her back inches  from the floor the girl could only wait for help i just remember closing my eyes and feeling numb and 
[00:16:00]  then not being able to move or speak or breathe oh and then i just kind of drifted off that's exactly  what happened claustrophobia oh my god so she had her foot just her heel the space between her toe  and heel was pretty much it i would be fucking it thank god i got it wasn't e-rock or bob kelly  those are some slender nice girls no kidding yeah oh thank god they didn't have boobies yet right

[00:17:00]  and caught that cat on the back of the head and took his head off guy or a cat no he took his head  off he took his head off it's a service elevator for what a construction site yeah the construction  site yeah those elevators are fucked up because there's nothing you know what i mean yeah they're  very very stopping it wow once in a while i saw the effects of that that was just i've seen photos of it 
[00:17:30]  i've seen photos of people wedged up there i'm telling you everyone thinks i'm nuts this is where  those horrible websites come in and this is why i fucking never never lollygag in elevator doors  don't lollygag there should be no lollygagging signs but it never happens this is like a such a rare  i forget how how i watched a special on elevators and people almost who makes those do is amazing when  they talked about how they used to they didn't have those things called the uh the governors which  will actually grip oh yeah they showed you moving too fast if it drops you can almost not plummet to 
[00:18:00]  death like from a 70th floor down as you're falling these things open and wedge the elevator so it  really won't and there's grips in the old days though no the old days it was a lift fall i don't even  say old days i'm sure there's a bunch of buildings with the old elevators still i bet they just have  not be even before these that those are probably still modern elevated i mean when they were first  created i bet they ought to you know put them back up to code or some code action yeah you can't just 
[00:18:30]  have people going into those we got a elevator mechanic uh this can't be good oh it's my man  you got it otis elevators yes hello uh i got a little uh i got a little one-on-one for you guys  what happens is uh an elevator counterweight is always attached to an elevator and it's 40 percent  heavier than the elevator cab when it's empty so what happened was she stepped in the brakes  failed the weight shot down and the cab shot up so she got fucking slowly split in half oh the 
[00:19:00]  weight went down yeah the elevator goes up now jimmy's talking about the governing system that's  in the down direction holy right the new elevators have these things called rope grippers where if  you over speed in the up direction it grabs the ropes and stops you from uh going up ah  willy wonk and right through the fucking willy wonk right through the fucking roof what what  happens though i always have a fear of going up and and not not going through the roof i've actually 
[00:19:30]  had nightmares about shooting through the roof anyway and it's not going to happen you're just  going to hit the ceiling and fall yeah but what if you're going up way too fast is it possible you  can hit the roof no yeah you could well there's nothing there's no like fucking spikes up there  like die on or not like that there's plenty of refuge space and there's there's a final and normal  limit an electrical limit that cut power to the system once you reach a terminal limit okay you're  not supposed it's not supposed to fail again anything could fail at any time so you never  right you ever see westworld of course no no that's basically what you're looking at here so 
[00:20:00]  she felt she felt it pretty good unfortunately i'm sure yeah it probably took a few seconds right  like how did her her foot was they said only her foot was sticking out why didn't she just get her  foot cut off maybe she was 100 years old and didn't jump out in time if you if you jump in and  out quick as it's drifting up maybe if you're fucking carl lewis maybe you can get out of there but  maybe you know she didn't have the ability to get out in time or whatever happened who knows what  happened what happened was it was a complete freak accident she had no time to do anything it was just one 
[00:20:30]  of those things yeah yeah because they said it shot up so that that's not going to give you enough  time to react no no but her foot was they said her foot was out like i think most of her was in the  elevator so if only her foot was out when it shot up i'm wondering why didn't it just sever her foot  when it hit the uh elevator door jam i'm wondering why she got dragged back up and wedged right if only  her foot was sticking out you think she just would have lost her foot no i see what you're saying  one time this is pretty interesting a lady had a dog on a leash and the electric eye didn't pick up how 
[00:21:00]  thin that the leash was oh the dog was in the hallway the woman was in the elevator door closed  the fucking car took off grabbed the leash snapped the leash just about killed the dog and pulled up  lady's arm right into the door breaking almost every bone what an idiot these elevator doors they  better be real careful wow they'll just take it for granted and think it's always going to work it's  always going to be fell safe and uh you know they'd never there's never going to be an issue and you  know it's just a machine yeah but like anything else i mean you're going to get a freak accident 
[00:21:30]  yeah yeah the the fact is what you said yeah no one's going to have a problem with elevators in  general but you wouldn't think a dog leash you're right but that's right that's just kind of thin and  narrow yeah i'm surprised that doesn't happen more often yeah yeah uh thanks sir thank you man  thank you brother what uh i wonder what uh former ona producer would have made a aerosmith song  crushed in an elevator you think that would have been a hit today oh boy he would have at least 
[00:22:00]  he would have at least tried to get it through you know let's get us fired guy  that asshole yeah well i'm in a bad mood oh shit oh no oh all right let me just bring up  but all right i'm not greenstein i'm good let's bring up stop oh no oh shit i didn't mean that i  didn't mean that god oh no oh no i so don't give a fuck about scott greenstein at this point i don't 
[00:22:30]  give a fuck oh what happened i so don't give a fuck about that guy especially twice the guy that i  don't think has ever had a normal conversation in his life with a human being oh no that's i so don't  give a fuck about the only time i hope you'll have a conversation with him is if uh scott is  right in between the elevator and the floor stand right there just stay there we'll talk a long  time i was hitting buttons but i don't even think but even in that situation i don't think i've ever 
[00:23:00]  had a conversation with a guy now no because he just talks in corporate fucking weird babble  shit and it is not a human being corporate speak i don't know what it is i've never had a real  conversation with that guy i don't think anyone here has had a real conversation with a guy  he's one of those weird schmoozers and that he doesn't say anything that he means i've shared  pleasantries you ever share pleasantries in the hallway no what's the last thing he said yeah the  last thing he said to me uh we're at the elevator it was the whole patrice thing going down you heard  and he goes you guys that that special uh you guys did was just terrific just terrific just terrific

[00:25:00]  or afraid of being on the ground there's something going on some weird shit right he he i think he  wouldn't go in elevators but he wound up falling down stairs or something and that would happen  like he got fucked up from that shit yeah i don't know the big fight happened because i didn't hear  but i talked to zito their producer after and he said that he said something about  billy's daughter or billy not billy being a father or his daughter oh boy that's always  been a you know you don't bring up his daughter why i don't know anything about it uh it was kind 
[00:25:30]  of a thing on the show years ago where he didn't really have the best relationship is she an adult  or is she at the time i don't think she was that much of an adult you know at this point now she's  got to be pretty old right yeah yeah i haven't seen the guy in 10 years probably i fell down subway  stairs oh really and uh it fucked him up to where he couldn't take elevators but that gave him like  a fear of elevators if you fell down stairs all you would want is an i know right i want to build  them all over his head up like he hit his head and all of a sudden got this weird whatever put some 
[00:26:00]  ice on us dude chuck mcganelli the comic he'll fuck it he runs up steps he'll do 30 flights of steps  that's why he's in good shape he won't take elevators he's an ass is there a reason like a fear or  a lot of people are claustrophobic i didn't used to take elevators for a while because  like through my equilibrium yes there wasn't a whites only elevator it would throw my equilibrium  off uh in the old days for some reason i just had like this i'd get off the elevator and feel like i  was dizzy from the weird uh every every once in a while i'll take the stairs and i live way up in 
[00:26:30]  the clouds yeah but that you want to add 40 some odd floors i'll do all all of them no problem you just  want to do that for health reasons every once in a while i'll just do it but this is  people who are terrified they won't be late for a date because they won't and if i can't get to  the gym i'm i'm such a loser i'll get off like 10 floors short and then do 10 floors just as a quick  little little thing why am i telling you this a quick little thing i just do a quick little thing 
[00:27:00]  so there's a big fight yeah fight fight why is why is billy fighting i think billy wanted to  maintain that he was the greatest of all time oh uh he doesn't like he's one of those guys you  know he doesn't like the young guys coming in he doesn't feel like the young guys are working like  he worked but why doesn't he ever come around i'm sorry why does he ever come out around a  festival i never hear him because he had this thing where he couldn't leave his house and now  someone's telling me he actually fell going up the stairs oh that's hard how many flights 
[00:27:30]  how fast is he running how do you fall going up he was on the moon  when you when you slip going up you just put your no gravity you put your hands out nothing  happens how do you fall going upstairs i don't know that's bizarre yeah so he wants to be known  as the best what coffee getter no i think he's really uh he's he's big ronnie doesn't really need  producers no so what is he talking about what didn't he he snuck into the city by hiding in a train on 
[00:28:00]  9 11. supposedly that's what he's known for that that's his claim to fame still he's kind of saying  you know he's super producer of all time how did he sneak in he just wanted to see the carnage yeah  what he's hiding in a bathroom he said he hid in a bathroom i used to hide in the bathroom just so i  didn't have to pay that's a good strategy that's easy what is he talking about he said him i'm so  annoyed now i had to shit him and dave he he's friends with dave yeah and saying that they're better  than pepper and zito i don't know anything about pepper and zito was dave a good 
[00:28:30]  producer was he just a funny on-air guy well he's great on the air yeah i used to see dave uh  like working a lot before the show he had stacks of papers and i don't know if he was doing anything  but it sure looked like he was as it depends on your definition of producer i mean he always had  bits ready to go yeah okay and you know ron and fez that's that's that's they counted their producers  for so i would say dave was a very good producer i think dave was really good yeah from what i saw  especially when i used to you know hang out after the show instead of leaving cartoon character silhouettes  of myself through the door so this was on 57th street yeah um hmm so what happened well they had 
[00:29:00]  a big fight is it worth playing or anything i mean i don't have i like yelling i like hearing  yeah i'll just listen ron and fez i just wasn't listening yesterday i would like to hear a little  yelling yeah i'm sure you're right i find like the end of the show piece of it how long was the  argument i think well it was it was brewing through the whole show but i'm sure we could get just the  the real the real meat and potatoes of the fight you know what i'm saying guys does ron really he 
[00:29:30]  again he doesn't really say what he needs a guy though he just he doesn't need a guy he knows what  he wants right yeah but you need he likes a guy that's good on the mic with him yeah you need  oh in that case you know he's had a bunch of guys that certainly have done that job you need somebody  that he could talk with and uh you need you know a guy to compile to compile all your stuff to put a  standalone producer well yeah no to put like you know i want to talk about this that and this and  to print out the news stories and to have angles on stuff right and to put stuff like that together 
[00:30:00]  i mean it's fuzzy going to be in rare form today because this elevator thing you know yeah i'll be  listening i'm gonna be listening from what i've heard i think this is your that's the first thing  well the second thing sorry look at the fat pussy on this fucking oh there's the one you were telling  me about yeah yeah where like like where look at some of the shots they're doing dude this is one  of the most erotic commercials for the hoodie footy on tv not as erotic and they're showing like i  don't see your pussy uh they just showed like before she she was laying on her back and she got a 
[00:30:30]  fucking muff on her where i know sorry i want to see look how annoying the blanket is it's like you  could try to use a blanket look she can't cover it covering itself i love how everyone could cover  their feet yes the hoodie footy lady is living life to the fullest she's got you know friends  and family and running around and the blanket lady is just caught up in a tangled web of humiliation  all alone with nothing but her dumb blanket she can't cover herself with she's working the blanket  like it's an abacus she has no way oh i do this my feet pop out ah my head's cold jesus lady 
[00:31:00]  does your ass smell if you're in one of those things too long oh no opie no okay they're wonderful oh  no no i'm talking about blanket lady oh blanket lady yeah yeah this is the long version too there's  a shot though where the woman is lying on her back i saw she's in the hoodie footy and you see like her  her uh through the hoodie footy her abs and stuff and then and then wham big  fucking muff uh staples got in a car wreck that's why he's all fucked up what no i heard paul fell down 
[00:31:30]  the stairs whatever you can't even deal with it or up the stairs we all we all got problems yeah  if i left paper here that i wrote on yesterday would somebody have thrown that out oh yeah oh  boy uh you'd have to ask sal the good intern i maybe sal or max i don't think matt would ever  purposely throw my paper if you leave kruger ands here someone will throw them away see because  they're valuable i don't know okay good but yeah feds will be in rare form today this this from what 
[00:32:00]  i know from listening to the show i would think this would very much bother well he has to get into  the elevator to come to the show anyway so that's going to be like number one is he's going to be  the the anxiety of him thinking that he's got to get in the elevator is he healthy enough to take the  stairs today hmm that's a that's a long trip up here when the earthquake hit the quake oh the big  the big one the big one when the big one remember the big one that hit new york yeah i felt that in the  outer banks and we yeah that's right i really did up here fed i didn't feel it on in the 
[00:32:30]  fucking upper west side i was asleep i slept through it no i felt nothing ron and fez were  on the air when that happened and fez was panicking because they wouldn't open the emergency exit to  take the stairs down because the earthquake had happened a couple hours ago and everything was  fine why wouldn't the emergency be open though that's just an exhaust i guess for an emergency  it really is dude it's an exhausting way to live i feel bad for him yeah that's all he worried about  he's very worried when most people knew that it was just it was just a tiny shake and nothing  changed no he really didn't like it god i feel bad for him it's like trapped it's like being 
[00:33:00]  trapped in that in that feel like there's certain fears like if you know you start smoking you're  gonna get cancer yeah but then there's that that all-encompassing just fear of everything  everything it's anxiety all right that's tough way to go yeah that's tough speaking of fear  um i tweeted really late last night did you see the fucking waterfall video that someone sent me  fuck yes don't go fuck what i think i got it figured out but i think it still would be scary 
[00:33:30]  as fuck have you seen this thing yet no uh just go to it's my last tweet there sambo okay you gotta  see this video man seriously we were talking about like videos that give you like the heebie jeebies  like the oh no my favorite website uh well there's an element to this video that might bother you oh  really oh yeah i watched a few more too that actually got oh it's called devil's pool victoria  falls if you follow me on twitter it's my last tweet so this lady's on a rock she's 20 feet from the 
[00:34:00]  edge right and she's gonna jump in it's the highest waterfall in the world highest waterfall in the  world hey wait why three two one action just watch this ant and people are like lame lame now there's a  black guy who's a mere what i'd say two feet from the edge two feet from the edge where you would  plummet and i would gather that is uh there's a little wall there right that's what i'm trying to  figure yeah there is do they call the the devil's arm chair it's a pool right there right but they're 
[00:34:30]  a mere a few feet from the edge that's craziness if you notice if you go over more where they are it's  not violently going over the edge probably because the rock is blocking it but if you go over more so you  you're getting a a little pool right right before it goes back up and over the fall so that little  lip uh keeps you in and there is a shelf there but why would you trust that who figured that out is  the question yeah someone had to do it they're trying to kill themselves an hour later they're still 
[00:35:00]  there right but i mean it's just horrifying to see this i know the black guy with those two white  women oh wait a minute you mean with the black guys this is wherever this is in africa where the  devil's falls are yeah these guys run like these weird expeditions where they they'll make sure  you're safe like these guys are locals and they know where to go so you're not going to get pushed  over the edge they didn't fall off the edge of the falls but now they have aids look at that they're 
[00:35:30]  so close crazy they're so close but they're so close they can't even really take a peek over the  side because it's freaking them out but there is a ledge there where you can see she's see her right  arm yeah and they call it the devil's armchair i saw which i hate the name of that but oh the  devil's armchair but look man oh god get away from her  it's not you missed the point this guy's saving their lives oh these dopey white chicks would be  dead if it wasn't for him oh my god is that highest waterfall on the planet i don't care if it's 
[00:36:00]  relatively safe look at that your mind would still be all fucked up now they're showing the camera  straight down right from the edge and you would just be gone in that mist of water rocks and  height but if you go over more you're pushed over the edge oh yeah then you're dead  wow we have uh what happened the last few minutes of running physics right here oh god a lot of  yelling what is he doing with them see the point here though with this uh this falls thing yeah like  when you're in a building and you look over the side or look through a window or if it's a glass 
[00:36:30]  you know uh floor you know you're safe but it freaks you the fuck out that i would assume it's the  same situation here you'd be out of your fucking mind you sure are trusting geology there that the  little piece of rock isn't going to snap off right right right make like a a little vortices where  it's just going to kind of suck you right through it and over you go and it looks like you could  easily go over the top of that yeah that too if you jump in and all of a sudden you jump maybe  slightly different and all of a sudden the current takes you around that little thing yeah what's 
[00:37:00]  scarier it horrified me whoever sent me that video thank you of being pulled like i've watched uh  when you see like niagara fall videos what's scarier than trying to swim and being pulled  backwards towards the fall there's no way you're making it and then uh this one of the people i  follow pretty plus more uh she's pretty cool she goes oh great you had a tweet that i i fell over a  waterfall so i wrote her i'm like what are you talking about she goes and she didn't explain 
[00:37:30]  enough unfortunately maybe she could call the show she says it's like you're in a washing machine i  broke my foot kicking out of the tumble i had to kick that hard what's that mean out of the tumble  you know at the bottom it's all just like oh wow and if you don't try to move out of that  fucking thing you're done so she was kicking so hard to get out of that she actually broke her foot  uh uh you see apocalyptic show when they go over the waterfall yeah that's great oh it's great i  hear the movie's great dude i'm blue i got it on blu-ray it's bringing in so violent i love it 
[00:38:00]  because i'm too lazy to go find it somewhere else if you bring it in i'll watch it yeah yeah right  player good goddamn movie it's fucking i know you can you read about it all the time i love mel gibson  as a director i hope he does more fucking sacrifice scenes oh fuck oh brutal but over the waterfall  and then dummy has to keep talking shit yeah yeah i am uh oh i am jaguar's party she's like just  run run asshole they're gonna you're pissing them off they're gonna come after you probably would 
[00:38:30]  a lot i live when the one guy's like the yeah yeah i think that we should go around and the  fucking guy just takes a knife and shoves it up and shut them up shut up oh there's some  fucking badass dudes in that man oh yeah i gotta watch that wow they didn't play games no you think we  have it rough all the mayans did is run run away from people trying to kill them in horrible ways  that was great yeah good one oh wait she did write me more overnight ah she goes i remember what i 
[00:39:00]  remember is a guy in a sombrero trying to save us i shattered my foot he almost drowned is trying to  save us it's the bottom that gets you you just tumble around uh i was with my boyfriend who had been  instructed to keep left or get swept away while we were on vacation we were navigate we were  navigating and he went to the class and i didn't so i didn't know oh that's fucked up what did you  say the navigating i guess i guess it's some kind of experience you do and as long as you navigate  the one way you're totally cool but for some reason she didn't go to the class and i guess the 
[00:39:30]  boyfriend forgot to mention you got to do it this way oh boy sure he did yeah you know what  you're not still with this guy i was nagging this guy a lot he's like god take a swim yeah  i'll be over here we were navigating and he went to the class and i didn't so i didn't know needless  to say he did not keep left we got caught up and before you know it the last thing i remember is a  guy in a sombrero trying to save us okay that's always good a kind of was it though i don't know 
[00:40:00]  anybody that except for this uh person that survived going over the fall must have been in  mexico then sam is really afraid of heights you get freaked out by these videos right yeah i really  realized it's afraid of heights until this summer what where are you is it on a porch no  hershey park oh wow that's uh wow what actually the highway you like to drive from no no but  i went up on one of those things is that a fart yeah that was really wet it was cute like right 
[00:40:30]  after mentioning hershey too that's yeah it kind of sounded hershey yeah one of those things that's  like an open cart that just pulls you it's almost like a ski lift and then you go around the park  looking down oh like the uh the little uh it's a tram ride right it's nothing and i got on thinking  all right this is easy no line let's jump on and look at the park and i jumped on and as soon as we  left the ground i started freaking the out oh no i had no idea did jess call you a fag no she i  told she left me alone because i couldn't make eye contact yeah i freaked out he was on one of those 
[00:41:00]  little cable trams that go around amusement parks it freaked me out too and it stopped no it didn't  stop it was just up so high i had no idea it was working perfectly from beginning to end but he was  just a scaredy cat they are very scared they're scary they're very scary you're just like the  island because you could just slide out under the bar and you'd be dead do you not i don't like  looking at something man-made that high there's something abnormal about seeing like when you look  up and you see like the wheels going over the track you're like you shouldn't be seeing from 
[00:41:30]  this angle yeah and when you go up with the poles that are supporting the uh the iron cables polish  people no oh polish people sorry but like and the ladders on them for like text to climb up yeah  when i saw the top of the ladder and the pole was right next to me and it was that big i freaked  the fuck you know i'm not supposed to see it from this angle it's too big like there's no way i  should ever see this i gotcha i'd be dead did you watch the videos we did uh of the people jumping out  of the uh my ex did it so i i filmed it from the bottom of the stratosphere you watch those right 
[00:42:00]  yeah it's horrifying that's insanity the scariest thing i could do that i definitely couldn't do it  yeah dana white told us about it as a goof we went for lunch with dana and you could see from his  office and she's like i want to i'm like no don't don't fucking do that no no it's it's completely  safe crazy i don't know about that i think it's completely so are elevators until you get ripped  in half well somebody will fall off this i don't waste it on anybody but somebody like that fucking  thing we watched yesterday on top of the uh but can't you put in perspective do you realize that 
[00:42:30]  more people especially in new york get killed just crossing streets by cars yeah yeah yeah highway  after there are so many people that get run over in new york city and now we got one elevator  victim and i bet you that's the first one in a while but statistically if as many people were  jumping off the stratosphere as they were crossing the street there'd be a lot more people falling  out of the stratosphere true you don't have millions of people doing it every day i don't think so  numerically i think the odds would increase i don't think they've had one problem though no not yet  when i was on that thing that the cart thing i was also like what you know when i went up high for 
[00:43:00]  the the ski lift ride yeah ski lift ride as soon as we left i said oh my god i can't get off this  without dying until it's over and when i realized that i had no control over anything that was  happening anymore i couldn't i couldn't deal at all that freeing though at that point no no i hated it  here's my you gotta make believe you still got some kind of control my fears are before i do something  that i you know or other people would perceive maybe dangerous is beforehand the anxiety once you're in 
[00:43:30]  it you're just in it and and now you got you have to you have to uh just deal with it until it's it's  done and over so i don't have the fear during the the scary thing i have the fear beforehand going into  it i didn't even realize it was scary because i didn't know i was scared of it then you probably  would have had it beforehand and then i did it and then i said oh shit i don't like this at all yeah  at all you had courage though you were brave no i wasn't when you got off were you were you still 
[00:44:00]  scared of you were you like trying to go like yeah it was cool no because i couldn't talk when i was  on there and i wasn't making eye contact with anything except what was in the way way distance  just saying oh look at that yeah she was just having a great time wiggling her feet around off  of it and saying yeah i was just answering one word sentences and i was like when we got off i was  like jess i was freaking the fuck out about those points where the uh the thing that's hooked on the  cable has to go over the pulleys oh when it turns around oh and it drops a little bit yeah that was 
[00:44:30]  the worst when it was turning when it did that turn it does the turn around the big pulley that  whoa yeah it was horrible horrible because it's not really on the cable at that point i know i know  oh boy and i'm looking at these schmucks and it's only hanging on the cable with a hook it's not like  the bottom is it latched in because it's got to go over the pulleys and these guys that are  manning and aren't exactly tech experts no they're carnies yeah you can never go skiing that's  scary i don't want to go skiing you ever been in a gondola no oh you don't want to do that what in 
[00:45:00]  uh venice they got gondolas they got the dago takes you around with the ore no the gondola yeah  or a gondolier takes you around which one am i fucking up you're not they're both names oh okay  i got scared i'm talking about the one on the water where you make there's one in uh cannon  mountain where i used to ski way up fucking north when we used to be in boston it was uh i think it's  uh new hampshire that's the closed in one fuck up yeah dude and it's like heated and shit right i 
[00:45:30]  thought it was pretty high in the air i remember and i used to go there like even i don't want to say  this oh just dress like spuds buck buckley well i checked out the leaves maybe once  i might have rode the gondola up to check out the leaves  why she loves nature i do look at that one it's orange  i wait wait two weeks and watch at home i was with a girl okay 
[00:46:00]  at least i was with a girl she's probably like let's fuck and you're like what about the leaves  like you're missing the place and uh we go to the top of canna mountain off season i used to ski it  too it's a sick fucking hill to ski because it's old school skiing but don't try to sound manly now  yeah i'd be up to kicking asses in the scrapbook yeah i'm gonna kill myself here trust me so i'm at  the top being a little faggot looking at the leaves right and all of a sudden i see a guy with a camera  just wandering around i'm like so i have to ask i'm like what are you doing because it didn't look 
[00:46:30]  like he had a camera to check out leaves right he goes yeah oh i'm taking pictures of bears  i'm like there's bears up here cheese  and we oh i know why because we decided that we're gonna we took the gondola up checked out  the stupid leaves and the view and then decided you know what would be a good experience we'll walk down  oh boy so that's what it was okay this is a new the memories popping in my head so the guy wasn't at 
[00:47:00]  the top of the mountain he was sort of in between the top and the bottom somewhere i don't remember  exactly so he's in the middle of nowhere with the camera i'm like what the fuck you doing because we  came across him because i'm taking uh pictures of bears and there's i'm having a lot of luck today  they're out they're they're out in full force and here we are the middle of the mountain walking down  go figure though you're in the mountains during fall right right when they're right when they're  actually getting their food getting ready for hibernation and things like that uh and you're  surprised there's bears you want to guess what we did ran down the mountain absolutely i'm not 
[00:47:30]  gonna sit here like making believe i'm a man's let's get out of here i was out of my mind scared  at this point because now we're not near the top we're not near the bottom it's kind of not kind of  there's a lot of fucking trees yeah and here's an asshole with a camera saying he's had he's having  a lot of luck taking pictures of bears that day did you hear the horrible bear story from uh jersey uh  with the cable cable installation guy what happened uh he went down into someone's basement  was the bear stealing cable it was stealing cable and always do that they get honey all over the 
[00:48:00]  controllers how come my controller doesn't work there's honey on it and there's bear duty in the  control i was just watching nat geo and to see his friends yeah i know that guy before we move on  i'm being called uh queer of the fall because i might have pumpkin pig queer i might have checked out a  leaf or two it's nothing to be ashamed i certainly have had some uh warm apple cider yes sure this uh  this gentleman was doing uh some cable work in somebody's basement and he has to drill you know 
[00:48:30]  they they do some drilling so he's drilling yeah and he hears in the basement in the basement behind  him a bear had gotten into the basement to start hibernating and he woke the motherfucker  he turns around he turns around there's a 500 pound black bear behind him in a basement in the  basement going just growling at the motherfucker it must have gotten in through a window or some  some way it got in there uh to hibernate you know please tell me the guy was mauled to death 
[00:49:00]  i mean please tell me uh hopefully it was a time warner guy not a installer no because he would have been  there a lot sooner for repairs well that's true uh let's see this news story said the repairman dropped  his tools uh and scampered out of the basement unharmed i don't think if you saw a black bear  behind you you'd be scampering scamper do they kill the bear or is it it looks like they tranquilized  it was knocked out by the way what a fuck that bear bears have instinct they're supposed to go into a 
[00:49:30]  hole you make a little how did the bear not notice hey there's a light switch and some  fucking it's a great game there's some there's pickled pigs feet here how did the bear not  realize he wasn't in a cave what a marvelous cave i found a really good cave look there's  television not dirt on the floor or anything maybe he decided to do some evolution maybe  he said you know what it's time to fucking you know make my situation a little better then he  should have spoke with the cable guy and said hey don't tell him i'm down here not growl at him 
[00:50:00]  like he's gonna rip his fucking innards out oh my god i had a cable guy talk my ear off holy  was it verizon or time warner i decided to stay with time warner  i had so many problems with my cable that i decided i gotta get a guy in he had to fix  he had to fix three cable boxes replace the modem it was unbelievable how much work this guy had  that's my favorite part of the story that you you had to call the cable guy yeah so you had to call  a cable guy anyway but you still stuck with time in the building for you i think at this point it'd do 
[00:50:30]  it just to annoy you guys i swear what happens to you you get stuck in these loops like i i get  that i think that's why no you i'm the same way it's like these weird little loops this  fucking guy you will be you and i swear if you got verizon you'd be like oh oh this is marvelous  look it's my version of bleaching my hair blonde to get some attention on the show okay okay  it's good for the story couldn't be that desperate and awful oh i don't know but this 
[00:51:00]  fucking guy it should have been a half hour he's there two hours talking my ear off about  everything because he probably doesn't get to talk to many people these days he was a nice guy so i  guess yeah because then when like service people are assholes to you piss but then if they go the  other way and they talk too much then you're pissed so now what the fuck was wrong with your  shit why did he have to replace so much stuff well he admitted oh he did did he no he admitted he  goes they gave you old boxes when they had new ones hate an old box but they do this they go they 
[00:51:30]  do this because what that what happens is they load the trucks up with all the equipment yeah and if  you're uh you know one of the last calls of the day you're going to get the shittier stuff because  they got they get they get new boxes so what does the new box look like um it looks pretty old is it  all black yeah yeah yeah all right see because i i don't know if that means anything because i well  my box sucks in my uh apartment in the city this guy told me that i should even upgrade further  and get the new cisco boxes whatever that means if that helps you why don't they just upgrade you 
[00:52:00]  automatically just give it to you then automatic right why do you have to have it why wouldn't  he have it he didn't have it in the truck but he had the like the next version oh that's i don't  know fuck them when i when i had files installed there was some there's a couple of issues uh there  was something that i needed i didn't have you know it was a whole conversion yeah those guys were  phenomenal the fucking supervisor came amazing right dude they were so yeah great and hands-on  horizon five oh here comes travis with it now travis travis was in one of the worst situations  that could ever happen to a human being he's a gay man in a straight marriage hey dr gay uh had time 
[00:52:30]  warner cable and hated it then the wonderfulness of fios was introduced and he scooped it up immediately  and loved it then tragedy struck he had to move to a place where he had to go back to time  warner cable another again flowers for algernon you're a retard you become intelligent you enjoy  in life and then back to being a retard again you see that movie no is that what that's about yes 
[00:53:00]  that was futuristic for some reason no he takes some kind of a uh uh experimental drug it's almost  like that movie uh plan of the apes de niro was it oh uh where yeah awakenings yeah awakenings but uh  it was flowers for algernon i thought dude i thought algernon was a planet i really did no  algernon was a mouse that would do the uh the maze but he couldn't do it and they get he was the one  they initially gave the medicine to and then he got real smart and then uh they gave it to the guy and 
[00:53:30]  he became real smart and then they noticed that the mouse became stupid again and that's when they  knew that he was going to become stupid but he was already he was real smart when he knew that he was  going to be stupid again it was really and that's like time warner fios time warner yeah let me tell  you something about this awesome cisco box that they're peddling you got one yes of course i have  one he makes it sound like the wagons here ah this wonderful elixir will help with baldness and the  scurvy it sucks just as much as all their other shitty boxes does it yeah and i was in the same 
[00:54:00]  situation as he was this guy brings me like an old box when he's when he's uh installing my  probably from someone's apartment that he just took it out of yeah this is a good one because  i i had time warner installed the box oh guess what didn't work after a day so i had to go get  a new one it's a day though it worked that's true that's true i had 24 hours i had more problems the  first two days that i had time warner again than i did the entire year that i had how annoyed were  you the first problem you had with time warner after having had files incredibly i would say i had 
[00:54:30]  to kick the guy out because he couldn't figure out how to work the internet i had to do it myself  really they suck dude they're terrible terrible they have no they have no ambition want or need to  upgrade their service their shit they're they're what they're horrible no and i got loyalty oh that's  what i got you're the guy i got the guy keeping them from i got loyalty from stepping up and doing  something he's also insisting on keeping his droid too it's the same psychology that  i almost love my joy it looks just like this it looks just like an iphone and an edit and he's 
[00:55:00]  loyal to the islanders you're a glutton i got loyalty what do you got at the end of the day i have  shitty time warner but uh well no but they'll they'll reserve those new boxes for new customers if if  but the fact that he oh god the fucking service and those motherfuckers didn't just bring the best  box they'll they'll bring existing customers yeah lower end box knowing the building is wired for 
[00:55:30]  files wouldn't they should be doing like any building that's wired for files that still has  time warner customers you think they'd be blowing them just fucking blowing them in the building to  keep them as customers where you could just say fuck you i got another choice anyone who's out there  if you work for time warner you you're you're getting the same thing that regular radio slept on  satellite radio you dummies are sleeping on files and you're going to try to catch up too late yep  you're not even trying to catch no they're not no because i asked the guy that question i go what 
[00:56:00]  are you guys doing about this whole file situation because i mean all kidding aside i will uh make the  leap and uh go to files i just was lazy and this time of year i just didn't want to deal with what's  going on i'm going to talk and cable vision too is the time warner of the east of course  cable vision sucks a dick too so i'm gonna ask your question i asked the guy i'm like  competition files everyone's turning over he goes yeah they're rewiring uh building uh 240 which is in  the neighborhood and uh i go i go well what do you think of that he goes ah what are you gonna do 
[00:56:30]  you know people have a choice out there and then you know they some people gonna choose a different uh  you know cable company better one he doesn't care he doesn't yeah it's gonna affect them eventually  but there's just shit they could be doing that they're not i agree to make it better i agree i was  trying to find uh the islanders canadians game the other night and it's on msg2 plus dude i couldn't  find the game did you ever find it i couldn't you know why because they don't have it in hd yet so  they don't offer it but the point is that i'm is that i used to have msg2 though sure but you don't  have msg2 plus two plus i thought i did no there's msg there's msg2 there's msg2 plus why don't they 
[00:57:00]  make it msg3 just make it ms oh that would be preposterous but no i mean because his team played my team  and i i wanted to watch that game i went around my team he likes the canadians oh stupid islanders  but he had and uh i couldn't find the fucking game no it was infuriating and here's the thing is that  you're going you know down down the guide you know espn's here msg's here uh yeah and on fios 
[00:57:30]  they don't even all bundled together all your color code are color coded and they still don't have  it in categories like he just exactly the sports channels are all over the fucking there's little  things that they could be doing that they're just not doing i could fucking go down and i could just  go like i said high def channels and now it's only showing me high def channels and then everything's  color coded movies are in red the sports have a green color and stuff tv shows it everything's  so concise so you can blow past just a certain color if you know you're looking for a show

[01:04:00]  anything else there's only a few spots though how does one of the spots go to a guy like this yeah he  went through all the hoops and he had some cash what happened to the other guys going through the  hoops they were crazier than this guy no it's he had that personality thing people that get ahead in  the polls early on in the uh the race here they don't get ahead in the polls because they'll make  the best president yeah they get ahead in the polls because they are popular they're out there they did or 
[01:04:30]  said something that uh that made people go oh who's that what and they get name recognition and  the numbers go up that's it period and that's what happened with herman king well this is what he's up  to now this is unbelievable i guess barba walters is interviewing barba why fuck them she yeah yes she  does like the uh black that's what i heard from years ago the black some of the black on this sunlit  day they won't let us near that guy no what the hell's wrong with jay thomas relax i don't know 
[01:05:00]  why wouldn't they let ira on the show i don't get because he was very good because we got better  radio from him i see him though he waves he wants us to save him badly i know he's not allowed he waves  very in a very excited state he really wants uh he's a slave part of this he's a slave i would never  hold a guy back and say that he could only be on this show our guys have been on a million  fucking shows man the fuck whatever the territory he was great i liked ira oh who didn't uh her 
[01:05:30]  mccain listen to this man this is a good piece of audio that uh msnbc uh put on their airwaves around  uh i don't know 550 555 this morning on up with the real news let's gather around the water cooler  for a brief moment to watch the return of a man we've missed quite a bit over the last couple of  weeks mr herman kane he made barbara walter's list of the year's most fascinating people  check out barbara's reaction when he answers this question what kind of cabinet position might you 
[01:06:00]  like if it were possible we are speaking totally totally hypothetical right totally totally  hypothetical uh department of defense what why department of defense because if i could influence  rebuilding our military the way it should be that would be a task i would consider undertaking  if you were secretary of defense it would be important to be familiar with the various countries 
[01:06:30]  around the world and you have had some difficulty with that mr kane yes but i have been doing my  homework ever since that difficulty you see her face what secretary of defense now we've taken the  liberty of putting together a resume tape that i think will show off for the department of defense  his foreign policy credentials you don't need to know the details of foreign policy in order to be a  good command in chief do you really believe that yes i do view china as a potential military threat 
[01:07:00]  they're trying to develop nuclear capability  and when they ask me who's the president of you becky becky becky becky stand stand i'm gonna say  you know i don't know do you know i was twirling around in my head um your move department of defense  he's putting it out there by the way who's that what what media outlet is it msnbc it's amazing 
[01:07:30]  how and and they were right because he is a dumb asshole yeah but just the fact that they put  together that thing to influence how you felt about this thing of course yeah yeah i hate that  network because for barbara walters though she was right any network would have done that no no  not not what that we've put together this to get you to show you as qualifications that's extremely  biased but people that use fox as the other end of msnbc it's you don't think they're as biased as  msnbc absolutely not msnbc could be the most politically biased uh station on on television 
[01:08:00]  it it is the worst they don't allow on uh conservatives to even give their point of  view i just saw that it's funny oh it's hysterical it was great believe me this guy's a blithering  idiot and she good for her man i love the fact that she's like you've had some trouble and this  dumb motherfucker says i've been doing my homework yeah too late shithead yeah no shit too late  it scares me i want people who don't need to be doing their homework now of course why am i  yelling the pizza pie stealth missile that's what i would do a department of defense i would know how 
[01:08:30]  to make a stealth pizza pie that fires uh pepperoni missiles at our enemy you think it'd be all pizza  analogies just bomb the country we knocked the cheese right off of that yeah oh we certainly did  we sauced them yeah he's just a pizza we put some filling in their crust  right you dolt he's an idiot he's a lunatic all right they was the ones eat the pie oh okay then 
[01:09:00]  this will bother you oh what we got more reverend al uh sort of yeah msnbc does he still have a good  sense of humor well i oh oh really oh i see what's going on here well msnbc compares romney  to the kkk and i do believe it was on reverend al's shoe romney to the kkk what i'm saying no  it wasn't on reverend al's no they did it in the morning and then they had their big host 
[01:09:30]  issue like apologies for the network was anybody fired though like like uh no of course not because it  was uh who i think is a jizz bag and i'm glad they attacked him but romney so but i mean they're  all terrible when you bring out things like nazi and kkk you better really you know you're really  underplaying what the nazis and kkk did when you just uh equate it to some guy who's trying to run  for office that really didn't um i don't know not many atrocities done under uh that gentleman right 
[01:10:00]  keep america american anymore that's because it was a central theme of the kkk in the 1920s  it was a rallying cry for the group's campaign of violence and intimidation against blacks gays and  jews the progressive blog america blog was the first to catch on to that all right let's slow down  a minute so is that is that true kkk oh yeah that slogan okay loved it so what so why does that mean  that uh and i'm not a romney guy i don't like the guy i think he's very close to having a nervous 
[01:10:30]  breakdown at all times yeah but uh why can't he use uh uh us that that phrase it's not like you know  uh and and and why can't you use that and it means something different yeah it's not inflammatory  why do you have to connect that to the kkk so easily because they're msnbc right that's ridiculous i  don't think when mitt romney said that he was thinking kkk evoking the words of the kkk i think  any you know thinking human being would would understand that's not what he was getting at yeah 
[01:11:00]  and why can't they say it that way on msnbc or any other network  msnbc is constantly bashing the shit out of anything that isn't left-wing liberal  but fox bashes obama fox is pretty bad with it you know what they bash sean hattie doesn't have one  nice thing to say about obama ever of course he doesn't okay you know what it's based on obama's  record i'll give him that much it's based on his his shitty record as a non-leader uh being president 
[01:11:30]  but they will always let both sides argue a point on fox i've seen i watch fox enough to know that  when they have an issue they bring on you know a democrat and a republican and they duke it out  and they let each other you know get their points across but the democrat is always one of those guys  that looks like a dummy in the hot tub no anthony you're so full of shit well i'm talking to a liberal  democrat here uh of course you're going to say i'm full of shit shut up fox does like to have this is  where you can't argue that they like the con that they had any always he has like gloria allred 
[01:12:00]  they love having yes conflict like that yeah because they understand that that works i think they  have a little more conflict than uh msnbc a lot more because you don't like over and have on guys  that would i i argue a whole lot i'm sure he had some more conflict because they allow the other point  of fucking view which i like on msnbc it's all them circle jerking to their liberal shit  fucking ideology fuck msnbc bunch of cocksuckers over there damn blonde cunt that can't fucking 
[01:12:30]  add one thing in the morning because they play their lean forward commercials uh because they  lean so far left they got to tell everyone lean forward fuck you everything i during those lean  forward commercials is all left-wing propaganda well lean forward means because they think they're  forward-thinking and no they're not that's what they think they're so left-leaning it's  fucking pathetic no no but they equate leaning left with being forward-thinking right that's the  arrogance of it they they equate leaning we don't lean left we lean forward they're not denying their 
[01:13:00]  bias they're just saying that we're not liberals but there's a progressive thing there's the right  way it's right terrible they balance out the right wing shut up denver pest you're on here every day  and i'm not going to bounce you but you're a fucking lefty liberal cunt bag your president stinks he  fucking stinks why do but you guys don't know leadership you don't have an answer what it's not  your answer there who gives a shit let's see what he does oh oh so four more years of no leader 
[01:13:30]  shithead is the answer i think both sides i think both sides are fucked you don't have an answer and  people aren't happy with obama let's go to a dictatorship where one guy can come in and just  fucking sweep everything then what are you saying who who's the guy what's the answer i i pray that uh  the republicans win just because you're going to realize there's no answer no there's an answer  there is just as bad in other ways i absolutely think we'd be better off economically with republicans 
[01:14:00]  in charge in the next uh four years right i think we would be i think obama is a fucking a shill of a  president he's a campaigner he he he is not presidential material he is not a leader he doesn't know how to  fucking talk to congress and make them actually get together he doesn't he he doesn't uh rule uh uh  his his minion congress uh the house and the senate with an iron fist all right that's fair enough  pussy he's on vacation after fucking time when when horrible uh shit's going down and people have to 
[01:14:30]  fucking uh discuss stuff who is your answer anybody uh that isn't uh a liberal democrat tax and spend  fuck what is it mit romney is it newt who's your answer give them a shot give them a shot what i  mean didn't you agree with patten oswald when he said that uh the republicans are having a bad year  uh no they're having a year like everyone else if you get you know every fucking election he meant bad  year meaning uh candidates yeah not too impressive with the candidates let me tell you something 
[01:15:00]  every fucking time before the primary the president looks like shit or the candidates look like shit  and get goofed on it happened if you remember clinton who everyone looks at as you know a very  good democratic president he was a joke before he got the nomination he's fucking playing the the  saxophone on arsenio and and late night talk shows are making fun of him come on remember yeah but i  think we've all agreed on this show that it's a little worse than usual this year it's not you don't 
[01:15:30]  think there's some fucked up guys up there you don't think fucking uh uh mccain and and and uh  uh the the bimbo there was fucking bad bad that was fucking horrid what i knew they were losing  look at rick perry look at her mccain rick perry's not going to be the candidate that you always get  the joke guys in there that michelle bachman that aren't working out it's going to be right i would  love to see min romney but he can't so far he's just kind of sitting there let's see what see what  happens well you know what ron paul in iowa it's interesting he's doing well  and surprisingly so i i wish he wasn't so old if ron paul was 10 years younger i would be in love 
[01:16:00]  with him but he's just a little old um but he's i like him a lot because he's gonna fall short  ron paul's gonna fall he will fall short but i want to see somebody in a third party because no  matter who you get we're not gonna get it this year do we just have this two-party we'll keep  pushing the third party and eventually it'll mean something but never we're not there yet because it  has to do with not there that's why i was trash that it i hope trump runs as a even though i don't  want to win running but i would love i love how he's teasing uh running for the presidency that 
[01:16:30]  guy is not right i agree but i would like him to why does the media say that like he's just having  fun with this and he loves the exposure why can't they say the real shit i don't want the story to  be over it's crazy for them i think they're right of course they're smart they want to make money they  want you to watch if they just said it's over end of story you'd never watch again when he said it  but every time he says it now you watch it's for them it's just self-interest do you think they're that  smart yes of course they are they're brilliant i mean look what they're why wouldn't they be able to spin it the  other way and make money off that look at this idiot he's still saying that he was going to run 
[01:17:00]  for the president because human nature is to keep people invested in the story to keep it going  people will keep no i get that part of it but why not uh make that the story that's interesting that  this guy is teasing america even though we all know he's not going to do it maybe they think that  that says it speaks for itself okay i'm guessing i don't know so they're basically working together  they both know each side like okay you're gonna release your uh your your little videos and we're  gonna play him and we'll make believe that this could possibly happen well for fox it's great when 
[01:17:30]  obama is elected and for msnbc a conservative republican that gets in would be great for  business because you're going to watch that to hear the counter no one watches it though but you  know what i'm saying for them and here's my the big difference between fox and msnbc msnbc can hire  reverend al sharpton who is through throughout his history been a race baiting fucking uh uh racist  um instigator uh uh i i think he's caused more violence than he's ever stopped in his career  yeah and he's hired by msnbc and i would love to see what would happen if fox hired david duke i 
[01:18:00]  agree as as uh their you know one of their commentary they hired fucking um mark firman as uh as a  expert on certain things and remember the shit that went down when they hired mark firman because he he  once maybe used the word nigger back in fucking uh when he was on the job as a cop yeah and that  comes up in the oj trial they make a big fucking thing about it bunch of hypocrites it's it is i  kind of agree with you on that point it's because fox is the only one though and this is where liberals 
[01:18:30]  have to stop denying it like they deny that the media is very left it is left so when you have ten  different liberal outlets or say six different ones you're not going to have as much focus on each  one individually doing fucked up shit but when you have the one main conservative one well that's the one  everybody looks right if there was four foxes hannity and o'reilly wouldn't be rated as highly  right but it would be less fucking you know i mean each punch would have less impact on one outlet  well let's get back to the kk thing uh kkk thing right okay so romney they're comparing him to a 
[01:19:00]  slogan that the kkk use which i think is completely ridiculous so then uh some of the guys apologized  here's chris matthews later in the day of us to do this and it showed an appalling lack of judgment  we apologize we really do to the romney campaign but even we really do we really do you know the  soldiers he's got a brian reagan uh he does deliverance to him a little bit and then uh al  sharpton this fucking guy uh boy but everybody knows he's a piece of shit yeah and msnbc gives 
[01:19:30]  him credibility and gives him a forum for his fucking drivel hate speech fuck him black viewers but  oh yeah that's what they're trying to do oh why don't they why don't they say that and now because  we wanted to bring in more black viewers here's reverend al sharpton please or he held us up so  we had to give him a show i would love to know what he's got on msnbc because that's how he usually  gets his shit that's how he got a little spot on satellite i don't know if he's still on but he got 
[01:20:00]  a spot on satellite because we fucked up he goes oh yeah well i might not make a stink if i get a  program period i i can't say who i talked to because uh they're long gone and i don't want  to fuck with their uh current career but basically reverend al starts sniffing around when the homeless  charlie thing happened and next thing you know to calm him the fuck down they gave him some time  on satellite radio i don't know if his show is still on i have no fucking idea but that's exactly  what happened uh a few years back and i wonder if he did the same thing to msnbc i would love to know 
[01:20:30]  yeah but here's stupid reverend al in a stupid blueberry pie face uh uh apologizing for who  who said the original comment i think it was just one of the general anchors so why is he getting  involved it was a well msnbc they as a network they said out of them all like let's let's apologize  across the board here oh boy so here you go one note one note before i go i want to say this  nb msnbc apologized tonight for reporting earlier today on a blog attempt that compared a phrase used 
[01:21:00]  by mitt romney to one once used by the kukuk's clan someone passionate about but as someone who's been  a victim of unproven innuendo and half-truths i agree the report was not proper if you could nail down  all the facts his network did the right thing by apologizing innuendo and fake and a false claim  like like to wanna brawley you fucking liar and and and it why is the apology uh good enough there 
[01:21:30]  reverend al once you get the guy fired that's because that's what you like to do point why  that's what you like to do remember when imus apologized that wasn't good enough not good  enough but one of your own guys apologizing on msnbc is good enough what a fucking hypocrite  but why is it you're right why isn't he bashing the network yeah having somebody of that mentality  on the same way he would the other way right why don't you say well thank you for the apology but  that's not good enough we need your fucking job because they're hypocrites and it's fake and it's 
[01:22:00]  all fucking no i'm just going with the individual here did anybody attack this shit bird but us he's  a piece of shit no he's untouchable remember when imus apologized and other people apologized in the  past but that wasn't good enough for you but this one's good enough why i'm sorry what's the difference  well get out why don't you spend five minutes on your stupid tv show tonight and explain what the  difference is because i would really like to know reverend al what a fucking hypocrite he is i  fucking hate that guy man he's the worst you should not be on that guy he should not be on what is 
[01:22:30]  attempting to be a legitimate news program it brings it down to the level of uh of just complete horse  shit with him uh spewing his his his crap yeah and yeah i know i know this uh lack o'more on twitter  yeah imus was on msnbc too so you know but you know back in the day you needed the msnbc brass to  get rid of him right yeah yeah or you're gonna raise holy hell exactly so fucking get one of your your  fellow employees fired just seems it only seems right yeah yeah same thing because honestly that's 
[01:23:00]  probably a bigger fuck up than what imus was doing who once again was just trying to entertain  his fucking audience probably you didn't like the line but the line was a funny and appropriate at  the time yeah if you're doing comedy in the morning sorry reverend al this guy made a huge leap with  the mitt romney kkk thing yeah trying to equate him with the kkk yeah i don't think i don't i wouldn't  think for a moment that mitt romney was you know going there now so get that guy fired reverend al 
[01:23:30]  yeah let's go ah let's go god and still hasn't talked about the cop that was shot point blank in  the face by the way oh no still hasn't mentioned anything why should he why should he mention the  judge that bloomberg is lashing out at the judge who let him go had a chance to fucking uh you know  what set bail at the time yeah what was it at officially hold him hold him back to fucking send 
[01:24:00]  him back to where uh he was up on charges for shooting another gentleman right this uh perhaps  that this dope of a judge which we were the first to say what the fuck her name's evelyn laporte  uh she had a chance to you know hold this lamont pride because he had a lot of priors and she did  not do the right thing at the time and then he was allowed to shoot this cop point blank in the  fucking face yeah and finally bloomberg uh is lashing out at the judge basically saying in my words what the  fuck and has it has sharp did not at all address this cop being shot yeah i mean i'm i don't watch 
[01:24:30]  all the time i don't know if he has or not i you know that's around the time i'm watching a lot of tv  because i'm you know i'm kind of babysitting my son and uh what would he say and i haven't i i didn't  see reverend al do with his agenda what would he possibly say how could he possibly twist this one  around to make it that uh you know he's him and his people his constituents are being victimized  so he's best to just shut his mouth he knows it if he was a man he'd fucking talk about it but he's 
[01:25:00]  not he's a fucking shill he's into his his own self-interest oh pay your fucking fair we got that  asshole talking about doing their uh their fair share of tax money and uh that and there's reverend al  fucking uh with the irs crawling deep in his bunghole because that motherfucker hi is up on tax evasion  charges or some shit nowhere obama blew it for me is the whole fair share i barack obama do solemnly  what but the fair share thing got me yeah because you know if we put our numbers out there how you 
[01:25:30]  know how much money we we we spend in taxes yeah and then you you turn around you insult people and  saying that that's not their fair share that's crazy well he should have he should have said it  a different way that's his problem he he wasn't smart enough to you know say it a different way so  now he's got a lot of people pissed off that really know the number they they throw out there every  year in taxes how about fair share and you know doing your part in the sacrifices that have to be made 
[01:26:00]  for the country uh go to the 50 of the country that aren't paying taxes instead of the as they say the  one percent by the way in new york state one percent of the people working in new york state one percent  pay forty three percent of new york state taxes one percent of the fucking uh earners  pay forty three percent wow of the taxes yeah that was how the  is that justified that is terrible this was this was reported everywhere it makes no sense 99 
[01:26:30]  percent pays the other 57 right right 99 pays that pays the rest and then they're saying  now that's bad enough but then to sit and smack those people in the face and say by the way not  doing enough it's like fuck you yeah and anyone that thinks like that that's where he blew it though  with this whole fair share people feel like they're paying their fair share and then cuomo uh uh just put  in more taxes by the way um uh but there's a tax break for what he calls the middle class which is 
[01:27:00]  actually the lower to middle class uh which they will be getting between two and four hundred dollars  more a year by the way between two and four hundred dollars more a year at the expense of people that  are in the upper echelon who will be taxed upwards of thirty six thousand dollars more a year  thirty six thousand more dollars a year from the wealthy so you can give the lower and lower middle  class two to four hundred dollars extra a year which in a year two hundred bucks really what are 
[01:27:30]  you gonna do put it towards a car that you can get in fucking uh 20 years a thousand years whatever  it is my my biggest issue is the government waste yes that's what no one addresses if i felt like uh  if i i swear to you man and this is going to kill anthony to hear this but i would actually pay  more taxes if i felt like it was if if it was being spent properly well if it was being spent  probably it would come back to you somehow it's not exactly but the waste that is happening in 
[01:28:00]  government no one wants to address that so they got to keep you know grabbing more and more money from  all of us yeah all of us is affected they really are everything is going up and it's it's it's crazy out  there and then you get the uh super committee that was trying to figure out what to cut in the  budget they would try to their whole job was here we're going to put together uh some democrats and  republicans get them in a room and discuss where this budget can be cut so we can maybe get a handle 
[01:28:30]  on this deficit and uh you know maybe not raise taxes as much just cut some shit they couldn't  fucking agree and that's both sides i'm not saying but believe me i'm not fucking saying it's both  sides they can't sit down and and agree that something is wasteful you mean to tell me as  just fuck being republicans and democrats people sitting in a room can't look at a list of things  and go wow that's fucking stupid how many people did he put an even number on each one oh yeah yeah  and this is where yeah you can't you have to give obama a break because this and me and 
[01:29:00]  nope talked about this in the car one time of all things to say about him i do believe that when  he said he wanted transparency and he wanted to i think he's one of those idealistic guys who really  meant it when he said it and i think he really wanted both sides to work i i think he was an  because he wasn't a fucking 20 year veteran i think he was very idealistic and really thought but  and if he can't get it done but here's the problem here's the problem and and even uh people in  congress have said this he doesn't uh use his leadership to go into these people and rack some 
[01:29:30]  heads the president's job is to one of his jobs obviously is to go in when there's things like this  happening and have meetings with uh people in congress and say look hey fuckers here's what  you're supposed to do not in a speech to the public get in a private room with these fucking guys and  start racking some head like a leader maybe i agree he's not that's the that's what they're 
[01:30:00]  complaining about it ain't me congress is saying he doesn't do this congress is saying he doesn't hit  our heads hard enough like he's not in there trying to make pitch he's not leading but he did something  which i think was to get an equal number from both sides you can't get fairer than that to get the  super committee both both people said he went out on a limb to get an even number of republicans  no no no i'm not saying it's a limb i'm saying it's fair though it's a fair way to do it and  those those shitheads couldn't do it yeah they can't fucking none of that the republicans are the 
[01:30:30]  democrats are probably asking for unreasonable stuff and the republicans won't give anything  because they want him to look bad because to have something go through now is only a success for him  before the election okay you're you're right the system you're right but let me point out this now we  got another bill uh on the table that is attached and attached to it is this uh uh the keystone um  oil pipeline bill uh that is for a pipeline from canada uh into the united states it would uh make a lot 
[01:31:00]  of jobs obama says he'll look at it after the election because he doesn't want to lose his  environmentalists uh that that are part of his uh core constituency meanwhile it's costing jobs this is  something that would put people to work a pipeline it would uh bring oil into the uh u.s and this  fucking guy doesn't want to do it because again he's playing politics instead of what's best for  the country which again yes both sides are doing but i he's in right now and i don't like the way 
[01:31:30]  he's doing it so we need to be someone else it drives me fucking crazy third party both of them  would be nice third party would help i really hope that a republican gets in there and then it's another  four years of shit and then the american people will understand that officially the system is  busted yeah i'm so i'm serious that's my take well it is that's my fucking take but i hope you get  your republican president i really do in this because then system i i can't sit and and hope for another  four years of this shit all right but then what when uh the republican gets in there and uh it's not 
[01:32:00]  much different i think it is different when republicans uh we'll see i do i think i think it's different  uh well we'll agree to disagree i think it is different when they're in i kind of hope i'm  kind of hoping for that because then maybe real change could happen in this fucking country and  the people have to finally start going what the fuck man the big mess happened when bush was in  office the big financial downslide started when he was he was there i mean it's i'm not blaming  a lot of money and again the war was something everyone was rah rah for and then in hindsight 
[01:32:30]  everybody starts the crucifying him for getting us in uh uh a war in two wars and then then  then you got obama speaking uh yesterday at uh fort bragg uh you know extolling the virtues of uh  the war and and the result of it and everything without once mentioning george bush so again  politically motivated each other but also never mentioned each other the iraq war is what most  people were a lot of people against afghanistan but i think they came around to that kind of  quick the iraq is the one but if you want to look at it afghanistan was the war that we really 
[01:33:00]  had to do right that's what i'm saying we kind of had to go in there because that's where the bad guys  were but the iraqi war everyone was gung-ho to go in there don't fuck it no don't bullshit  everybody when they came out regardless of the bad intelligence whatever you want to call the  bullshit we were all gung-ho to go the fuck in there because we had been fucked up and we needed  someone's ass to kick no the liberals were against it i'm telling you afghanistan they were signed off  on it a lot of them signed off on the war but i mean hillary clinton was all for it going into iraq a 
[01:33:30]  lot of people were against they are they were time remember when michael moore and this is where  i like in sight he got booed and this is one thing he did that took a lot of balls when he attacked  bush he said it's a fictitious war and like you know he called him out uh and look maybe you're  gonna say but he but he did it in an award show and even they booed him but there's a lot of people  against uh going into iraq i don't know about that a lot of people were uh really fighting about  a tough crowd i mean we would fight back and forth and all the left comics were against it and i was  wrong i admit in hindsight i was fucking wrong i i should have been against it and i wasn't 
[01:34:00]  uh i want to get back to this judge thing because uh it's important to read this one paragraph bloomberg  lashes out a judge who freed cop killer this cop killer story is is right in front of all of us  especially here in new york city uh and bloomberg says the reason he was not behind bars the last time  is that a judge here in new york not only didn't put him in uh behind bars she didn't even think it was  appropriate for bail yeah he didn't even get bail no bail and he he shot a guy in north carolina right 
[01:34:30]  or shot at a guy did he shot uh at least at a guy at least at a guy and he had some drug uh priors  and this uh this stupid judge didn't even think uh bail was appropriate and he had a long history of  not showing up he had a long criminal record the mayor said visibly upset so the mayor's fucking pissed  for once because this mayor of ours never gets again uh a black judge uh black female judge being  maternalistic to a black uh perp a black criminal um and and being lenient with him out of this 
[01:35:00]  maternal instinct thing that goes on between black uh female judges and uh male uh perpetrators  there's something in place uh he says if the judge didn't understand the warrant from north carolina  the judge could have picked up the phone said the mayor mayor basically saying it would have taken  one phone call right we would have held this guy and it was obvious that this guy should have been  held would have saved the cop for what uh what he was up to at that point a good guy who was fucking  trying to raise a family in the suburbs just a nice life married fucking kids every day and it's like 
[01:35:30]  and for for some scumbag fuck to be let out with no bail this guy has to be sacrificed what a load of  shit i guess he shot a guy in the foot north carolina get that fucking judge off the bench  yank her off the fucking bench and and and put her in housekeeping clothes make her i've had it make  her do parking tickets whatever give me the other paper there because there's a fund uh the one yeah  i think there's a fund because it says um help send peter fogoski's kids to college that's what he 
[01:36:00]  was working for he could have he could have retired after 20 years uh but he stayed on how do we do  this two two more years and he would have stayed on longer because he had to uh he had to pay for  his kids college you can mail your checks uh donate by credit card or uh debit card at www well  www.nycpolicefoundation.org if you want to help out uh this this guy's four daughters he was he stayed 
[01:36:30]  on a shitty job because he wanted to send him to college and now he's fucking dead isn't it amazing  too in this in this this is where the government waste a guy who's got 22 years as a cop has to  stay extra time to get his kids into college like that's where the fucking tuition costs are  fucking all those years of him working as a cop yeah his pension still wouldn't have been enough  so it's still not enough to send them to school it's disgusting it's terrible i mean while congress  when i think get good health care for life like oh fucking the awful yeah the college cost thing 
[01:37:00]  that's one of my issues it drives me nuts what people are paying to go to college now it's the  whole state of what ridiculous what congress gets for being congressman is so bastardized from what  they were supposed to be yeah they're they're like now beholden to to companies and i know this  is some of what you know the stupid occupy wall street people are dancing with hairy armpits uh in  protest too but uh there is a legitimate concern that the politicians the congress uh congressmen 
[01:37:30]  uh they're getting contributions from companies and giving them favors instead of doing what they're  supposed to do which is represent uh the people let me ask you something you know better than i uh  was it ever supposed to be a career congress uh i don't think so no no i think it was just supposed  to be you're in here you're elected uh you do your job i guess you get re-elected you don't you  turn into a career turned into this whole thing where money is a lot more important now you got 
[01:38:00]  career politicians and that seems to go against you know yeah what was set up how is it that these  people stay in office when uh most people aren't happy with their job that they're doing and their  their job depends on them being elected by the people they represent yet the people they represent  don't like them yet they continue to get re-elected because they're smart because they're smart when they  campaign they throw a lot of bullshit at you and then they get in and do whatever the fuck they  want well if people are not but then they deserve to be and they're not held accountable for anything 
[01:38:30]  they do it's unbelievable and they're also not at this point i think we all know politicians are  just lying sacks of shit in general and the lobbying that goes on right it's all it's all  stuff that you don't go to the voters with each thing all right look they want to do this  and they want to put this and this in they don't talk about pork barrel in your face it's just  i wouldn't have voted i wouldn't have voted for a local guy that said hey you can't build a fence  around your yard without paying us a fuckload of money like i never would have that's not  representing me right who the fuck right wanted that where it got through right now there's you 
[01:39:00]  could count thousands of rules and laws and zoning codes and all kinds of things that i never and i  don't think any person in their right mind would agree to did you grease any inspectors uh you know they  have their fees that you have to pay them right let's just put it that way it's just another way  to make money because they don't know how to handle the money they already got from you so they keep  coming up with this shit but but the thing is how is it there's a day they keep getting elected and 
[01:39:30]  these things get get uh put across right when they're fucking you over you go why am i being  fucked up why do i have to pay to have a tree taken down in my yard i need a tree removal permit and  then i have to have an inspector come up all this horseshit to chop a tree down in my yard it's like  who voted for that and and when we were growing up you just cut down the trick yeah you cut you  didn't even think twice about it no one just comes up with this shit based on what their constituents  want it has to be some other thing and then they keep getting re-elected yeah the other thing is 
[01:40:00]  their budgets suck and they got to figure out how to bring more money in and then they get the more  money in and they they don't handle that money properly either cut all the fucking shit that's going  on in their offices uh it's just the the waste of money that's wrong at first and the robbing of of  the the the population before i even focus on a party that's my that's my thing go already waste  cool super i go rah rah the democrat will get it done rah rah republican will get it done i think  fucking government waste first always the fact that that committee couldn't decide on it and then 
[01:40:30]  they painted like obama's super committee it's fucking these cocksuckers just all they think  about every one of them jockeys for position in the next election right all of them do all they're  thinking about the interest of this country when they say my job and it's my pleasure to serve this  country and shut up you're just fucking dancing for your next job all of them do it yeah they the fact  that they couldn't get together an even number of them and do anything and look at some 
[01:41:00]  shit and just go yeah wow that is wasteful let's cut that from the budget let's cut this let's cut  that wow okay we chopped a little chunk out of that i'll see you tomorrow but uh no no  china's got an aircraft carrier really didn't they always or no no is that new yeah well that's nice  china says carriers for research and training shut up shut the fuck up research i hope 
[01:41:30]  there's your next president newt gingrich he'll get it done yes no one's gonna endorse him  he's cheating on one wife for the next one the next wife for the next one who cares no i don't care  fucking a guy that cheats on his wife might make the best president ever no no no but i'm saying  did they i don't know what newt was saying when clinton was in trouble yeah but was he uh going  after him or was he quiet i'm not sure all right that was that was tense well you know you get into  these things as we uh go down the uh why don't we uh line to uh we're just a room full of queers 
[01:42:00]  yes we are whoa come on whoa it's all right decision 2012 uh european anthony uh we are your  go barack four more years go back to illinois yeah let's um  i think we should take a break come back and play the uh audio that oh 
[01:42:30]  we didn't get to do the ron and phil's want to hear that all right we'll do that next yeah  sirius xm sirius xm yeah yeah this is the opinion anthony show  like the rage and likes the rage yeah they were angry yeah  hurricane experts admit they can't predict hurricanes early 
[01:43:00]  nah that's about time they admit that hey um we did this yesterday time magazine's uh  protester the protester is their person of the year would be their person of the year and uh you  know to the occupy wall street people it's it's it's not you no you're part of it but the only 
[01:43:30]  reason they picked protester as the protester as person of the year was i think egypt it's egypt  it's libya it's it's any of these uh syria syria it's it's this protesters that absolutely made a  difference in uh in what they wanted to do you know they they overthrew dictators they they ousted  governments they got themselves the uh ability to vote occupy is a part of that but not a big  part i think time magazine was really focused on what happened in egypt and libya they were using 
[01:44:00]  the occupy people as a okay and here's our american version of this fucking you know nonsense right uh  so so they said the protester but to see michael moore tweeting yesterday about how uh look time  magazine recognized you people it's like shut the fuck up you fat cunt god i don't like him  oh he's a douche next time you should tell him though well i shouldn't just sit down and have tea 
[01:44:30]  with the gentleman like we did last time well you know what i've i've grown to dislike him more than  i ever have before so fair enough uh yeah yeah um who was in second place time magazine oh do they do  that there's a vote huh a vote there is a vote so there is an actual second place but they don't  announce who's me second why wouldn't they show it was me you i'm gonna say that because they don't  announce what was the question like who who got who was close to person of the year person of the 
[01:45:00]  year on time i would love to know who was up up up for this steve jobs was up for it whoops but steve  jobs got it already right has he i'm sure he never did some year come on no we went back to 1991 and  he didn't have it wow 90 yeah what about 90. steve jobs shouldn't have got it this year though just  because he died yeah his influence is ridiculous obviously but it's uh he changed the world but  how do you change the world how do you not a motherfucker uh change the world 
[01:45:30]  you think the molester was in second place yeah sandusky it was a good year for the molester  yes person of the rear person what is that our stern announces he's new host of america's got talent  what yes this is just blowing up on the twitter verse is that real  he replaces what peers well it says oh stop it justin stengel is fucking announcing that eric 
[01:46:00]  said it popped up first on sirius xm canada's twitter i mean he's on the air today i think this  is crazy that's a rumor i don't know is it i watched that show i like america's got but if he's host  that's nick cannon's gig huh i hope he's not fucking with my man nick cannon oh she  no he wouldn't host he would judge i would think he's not gonna he's not gonna fucking that's a  bunch of malarkey kenny kenny's in you didn't hear nothing from me uh kenny you're on the radio oh 
[01:46:30]  shit don't tell him he won't know yeah there's a buzz in the hallway that howard's agent is in studio  and that in fact is steve sternio well well he's the judge not the talent not the host well let's go  talk to that guy howard's the new judge good for him yeah he should be a judge so he's replacing peers  yeah i thought that was all pr too like i really didn't think that was uh i thought that was one  of those things because he's such a good pr machine yeah how much does uh sirius get kicked back to them 
[01:47:00]  probably not is that part of the deal no when you do anything outside of the realm of this place  you got to kick money back to him not if your agent works it out where you own everything and you  don't have to i guess so they're moving the show to new york for him what yes it will no longer be  in la the show is being moved to new york but i do watch this show and they go from they go to a  bunch of cities will he do that part of it i don't know if the other preliminaries and all that the  audition yeah he's enough days off dude they may do it where they just the auditions are held on 
[01:47:30]  fridays might have to take a few more days off i'm thinking see he even knows he even knows that  he has no heat because this stupid place yeah that's the only reason why he's doing it  it's got a he's frustrated a little more heat and i'm not i'm not taking anything away from howard  but you lose heat work for this company yes so he decided fuck that i'm sick of not having as much  heat as i used to and i got i now i got a great opportunity to be on a really popular show yeah  so you know what congratulations to howard stern he will go city to city all right well yeah but 
[01:48:00]  he has enough vacation time they can schedule that around the reason he's doing it he was sick of not  having as much heat as he used to because that's what happens with this shit yeah i've  fucking had it locked in a little ball i had it and then you try to do something to get a little  more heat for yourself and these guys fucking you know put the kibosh on it put the hammer on you  he's smart though that he doesn't he doesn't rely on these guys to do it like if you relied on the  company with their pr department he doesn't rely on the pr department he's got his own people right  engineering oh oh see yeah it's my humble opinion that's why that's my it's my humble opinion that's 
[01:48:30]  why he's doing it he doesn't need he absolutely doesn't need the money but i'm sure he's frustrated  he doesn't have as much exposure as he used to yeah it's happening to a lot of us around here  that's what happens and our exposure is on different levels i remember where we were and  we're nowhere near that ah remember remember the time of our life and you know in all fairness  howard same thing yeah but now he's getting you know he gets right in the fucking spotlight again  man that that show is huge kenny looks like he's chomping at the desk to get on mike yes kenny well 
[01:49:00]  i could make a big announcement on your show that'll trump that announcement oh kenny oh boy  kenny can only imagine what this is you want a drum roll or anything well we don't have one of  those sound effects we haven't had a thousand years friends on your facebook page no pay attention  people oh no jim norton will be in queensberry new york this weekend at the sweet basil restaurant  and comedy club two shows friday two shows saturday do you think that's gonna trump that 
[01:49:30]  announcement i don't think so kenny it's close hey james anthony yeah breaking news howard stern is  now suing america's got talent for 20 million dollars that's breaking breaking news a cnn should have  that at any moment his fucking agent is good man that buckwall son of a bitch is good we gotta  earn an agent bob can only you know he's he's distracted he's got a lot of stuff going on and

[01:56:00]  was in cahoots with those guys it was a big over the top fucking bit for april fools i guess but yeah  um and then uh i think uh i don't remember this bit what happened i think they called from outside  the studio and we're keeping the bit going yeah really getting us riled up and then he came through  the door to say that it was all a bit but at that moment i was already out of my seat to punch him in 
[01:56:30]  the face yeah so when he came in he was trying to everybody was in slow motion going no because we all  know it was a bit well you didn't know i didn't know no one knew because i guess there was a wink that  happened to you meaning you know here we go here's the punchline but it was too late because i already  threw my headphones down and was was attacking yeah i remember that one that was a good one yeah  that was a good day yeah remember like that there was brawls going on before that it was crazy 
[01:57:00]  so ron and fez had an argument all right ron and fez are in uh not with the outs i guess not with each  other no you guys are phrasing that wrong every time on their show what happened there was an argument  on their show but billy staples and who their former producer billy staples argued with their  current crop of producers uh hicks and zito they're a duo hicks and zito i don't know who  mccartney and lennon exactly like mccartney and lennon except more talented pepper hicks i've never said 
[01:57:30]  hello to and he's never said hello to me why i don't think it's anything aggressive exactly it's not  an aggressive thing he's just he goes about his business a certain way he's here to work and that's it  i like him on the show but i'm here who's the other guy zito do i know him he's like a little  wiener i don't know man he's on the air a lot yeah yeah all right so uh they fought gerard butler  by the way is up here announcing some golden globe nominations looks nothing like the guy from  300 anymore yeah he just looks nothing like the guy in studio i wasn't here that day i know he looks 
[01:58:00]  like mcconaughey i was off god picture made for television roma lagaray the hour what diane lane  cinema verite elizabeth mcgovern downtown evie masterpiece emily watson appropriate adult  speak english kate winslet mildred pierce best performance by an actor in a supporting  that latina fucks it all up damn is she beautiful yeah she's great sofia who is she

[02:00:00]  caribbean is latin you say i'm caribbean no if you roll your r's you're latino that's that's  the rule it's very easy she's an ass model and your huts a model ass  see stupid word play oh here we go word play no it's my favorite thing like i put up that video  yesterday of you getting a reaction of eric it's just a basic whatever video but what i love is the  comments because people get so confused they're like but he's not even that fat oh i know yeah they 
[02:00:30]  get so confused like why are they calling this guy fat he's not even that fat fatter than he was  yeah sure i that make people think that he rocks from florida originally and and that he's fat  like a really big fat he is from florida and he's 40. born and raised is she married no i don't think  so fuck you want her you got a shot now you got a shot if she can we see another picture of her 
[02:01:00]  ass come in here and go oh you're jimmy norton the comedian do you really like the lips so big oh my  i shouldn't say that on the air i think a latino girl would ruin you jimmy dude i don't like that  they would ruin you what's that from what picture is that from thanks she's being hugged by uh in  the jungle she's in the jungle naked i think there's a tree gorilla it's probably not a real gorilla  it's kind of gorilla probably because he's grabbing her tit yeah i think a gorilla would be that smart  what gave it away the fact that he was grabbing her tit yeah yeah that could have been 
[02:01:30]  all right let's just get off the screen i can't look at this sam i want to hear the argument horribly  distracting oh my tough guy opie again what are you talking about what do you mean that's something  that happened i punched a guy on the air i'm not a tough guy i'm an idiot oh i'll be the first  to admit i'm not a tough guy i'm an idiot i get myself in dumb situations that doesn't mean i'm a  tough guy tougher than sam i did fuck him up pretty good though i'm gonna ban you for that yeah i'm  gonna just like a good ban over at that side of the studio i've never claimed to be a tough guy 
[02:02:00]  idiot hey i'm an idiot you know what you're doing right now i'm kind of psycho but you know what  you're doing now you're being a tough guy am i you're banning him all right there you go  so i'm sorry uh and i think he's a regular but sorry you're a regular claim to be a tough guy oh  i'm a i'm a jerk i'm an idiot hard guy was the word when i was a kid remember that word what are you  hard guy oh really do you guys say that or no we just think he's a hard guy i ain't no hard guy  yeah yeah get it right i'm not a tough guy so first of it there was a little brawl yes so 
[02:02:30]  they're trying to figure out who who was the uh the greatest what producer and so it got ugly and  now yeah just play the tape and then zito brought up billy stable's daughter and then you know  shit got crazy let's hear this oh boy so please you're gonna put me down there's plenty of things  to put down do not put down my courage bravery and athletic ability and willingness to get at it with  somebody fuzzy you heard everything that went on today do you stand shoulder to shoulder with 
[02:03:00]  stanley and zeitz or with billy staples with billy staples oh what the fuck that's gonna make tomorrow  weird jesus christ it's very weird why the fuck is this happening what the fuck pause who's that  why the fuck would fez like go with the old guy instead of his current guys it's a great question  is it a great question or is fez gonna have a problem with me now that i brought this up to me  that's a terrific question you think like if i if if holy shit billy staples was a standalone producer 
[02:03:30]  is what i'm saying but what was the question the greatest producer ever who do you side with they  were arguing who do you side with as what you know well yeah the argument was who who was better  as a producer like if garrett came in here you all said yeah right pretty damn good man but he's not  as good as me he wasn't a producer was he the producer no he was like a glorified intern we never  are we all at this point i don't think we never really had a producer until recently we always had 
[02:04:00]  guys that sort of had the title but they weren't that good at it what are you saying i'm serious no i  mean i'm not disagreeing i just think it's funny that you're being so honest why that's what you're  supposed to do i like that not a lot of people do as he decided billy staples was the greatest  producer he sided with the old producer instead of the newbies and they're not even that new i mean  hicks has been around for four or five years okay let's hear the rest of this with billy staples  oh what the fuck that's gonna make tomorrow jesus fucking christ very weird why the 
[02:04:30]  fuck is this happening what the fuck the dander my fucking chest good good i'm glad perfect billy  staples billy staples everybody really made a lot of good points today what happened what would it be  if there's somebody else sitting here saying it what if they brought in a consultant from and sat here  and said the same thing i don't fucking help around here right i'm just looking i really really think  that i'm here to fucking watch you fail i think i struck a nerve it makes me and zio look like 
[02:05:00]  shit i think it makes you guys very happy really yes you fucking up makes me happy i think everyone  gets the giggles and can't wait for the next one you don't think our lives would be easier to  fucking go wrong because i fucking love when shit goes fucking wrong you don't think things would be  easier for us if you didn't fuck up why are you yelling at fez to begin with because he just  fucking shit all over me it's the name it's another point time out that's why excuse me  it's the ron and fez show yes okay it's their show you work for them yes okay you don't yell at the 
[02:05:30]  host all over me so he's your boss did you hear what he said yes then i fucking he's your boss  that's it right he's your boss perfect perfect you don't think that this is the end of a great  fucking day he's your boss you said it your boss tell you don't yell at the street don't fire me if  you think i don't fucking help you or i fucking don't do well for the show  shit can't be today well come on what i said when i say people enjoy it when i screw up 
[02:06:00]  what it was but the question was who you stand and shoulder to shoulder with  and you pick staples over hicks and then you're surprised that hicks is upset  because we're here every day with you and staples is here three or four days a year  so wait that makes things better because you spend more time with someone yeah when you spend  that time with somebody it's like making enemies out of us almost being like no you make yourself 
[02:06:30]  enemies maybe you should listen to a show what ron said you know what when we did bits on the air go  staples go back and listen to it go back and listen to that bit and see how it worked and see what  didn't work listen to a fucking show one time guys listen to yourself you're gonna plug you in  that tomorrow at your house yeah i will i will be listening to it at my house  hicks yeah boss you're phenomenal no apparently no yes you are you're 
[02:07:00]  fucking phenomenal seriously put that down you are phenomenal put it down put it down  build the xmas dot com  is that it that's how it ended people saying you missed the best part of course you did oh  people say where they hide under a scale  i'm sorry i didn't mean that not under a pizza  people saying that was the after fight fight well i mean to be fair to e-rock it's not like we can 
[02:07:30]  sit here and listen to the people saying the other part was way better and this was the after  fight how about finding the right part here when they're in kiss you on your dumb billy staples  come in here and uh exactly what are the people saying did we play the right part uh no sam did  people aren't really saying i didn't hear every single part yeah i i didn't either eric why don't 
[02:08:00]  you go back and listen to that come on sexy why don't you listen to something once once you listen to  the show sexy ow ow he's so sexy ow ow he is sexy he's so so that was the end of the show so that's  going to be uncomfortable for the boys today yeah and then you got the elevator thing yeah that'll  that'll kind of i am so listening to ron and fez today oh yeah because he got this today is a must  listen if fez is even up here because he's got to get in an elevator i i'm telling you this is going 
[02:08:30]  to make it very difficult for him to come upstairs yeah can i make zito a better producer today oh  yeah he should wait for fez outside the building you're talking good audio record him yes because  he does his loops around the building to get brave enough to even enter the building why does he do  that is that a bravery thing or is that just he likes what does he do does he walk around the  building a bunch of times taking a walk oh boy now i got problems with fez oh boy well you just  said he does laps around the building well we all know that and we're not supposed to mention it 
[02:09:00]  i'm up here yeah he does a couple laps until he it feels right he's one of those guys and nobody  does that what do you mean there's people that do things until it feels right and then they go about  their day ocd i don't know what it is i would think so it sounds like that he does loops and then he  also does loops when he's in here what do you mean like around the why are you making believe you  don't know this sam i'm not i'm not doing i'm just being like you what do you mean what are you  talking about i don't know i don't know how many loops it's six what i don't know how many loops 
[02:09:30]  fez does but he does and every once in a while ronnie will join him for one lap just one maybe even a  half yeah we'll do a half a lap with fez and then fez continues and then ron goes inside and then when  he gets here he's got some kind of routine i don't see i'm on the air right before fez gets here it must be  exhausting yeah i can't imagine i don't get it it's his thing i don't know what it is if someone  has more info please yeah but you're right because fez he's not going to be able to come up on the 
[02:10:00]  elevator and he's got his whole staff man well with the elevator tragedy we had here in new york i'm  telling you they should fucking meet fez outside today because that would be great audio to see  what's going on in the show from outside on the phone oh boy that'd be funny oh no i'm just he's  got to be up here and and do this he'll come up what are you saying he contributes an equal  amount from outside as he doesn't on the phone so he can still talk oh so you're basically saying  he's one of those guys that could just call it in oh no that's a very that's a very literal  interpretation no no no now we're getting into territories that that's what you're saying sam 
[02:10:30]  like but let the record state it was sam that said it well i think uh it's been a lot of  shit stirring in here this let's go to patrick patrick maybe some for me your reason hey patrick  what'd you hit three goals in hockey no that's a wow holy shit it's not bad i like the elevator  incident to fez yesterday it got silent for like 30 seconds which is the normal dead air time on the 
[02:11:00]  show and fez was like that still happens in this day and age oh yeah it does and uh and ron said yeah  crush somebody and um fez started freaking out oh so they knew about it yesterday oh so that's an  older story it just made the papers today yeah if i have it yesterday after them right around the time  they uh started their show i guess and then but fez was already up he hasn't had to do it well i guess 
[02:11:30]  he had to do the elevator down yesterday but he was doomed to finding out what building it was at  and they said it was 285 madison and he was uh google earth in the building why just just to see how  close he was from being in that elevator we all do that that's true do you not do that i don't because  i had no business or reason to be in that building and it just never would have been i know where madison  avenue you don't need to google it madison avenue if he was in that spot instead of that lady 
[02:12:00]  it would have been him that's right maybe not he might have pulled his foot in faster  there are spots in new york city today that would not be a good place to be right you're right and  it's either you or somebody else that could be in that spot ah you're really fueling i don't think  i want to be there but think about it there's actual spots right now that are i think predetermined  that are bad spots to be today people don't know you just don't know  damn really yeah i don't like that i hope it's not here 
[02:12:30]  that would have been in the elevator that would have been about 10 less words spoken on the show  today all right look i've heard a lot more than 10 words maybe 15 i mean let's be honest with each  other and it's really just gonna make trouble boy patrick you're really bringing in a pot and giving  it a good stirring all right patrick i'm gonna hang up on you and that's that 
[02:13:00]  i think hicks and zito do a great job on the show oh yeah i love the hicks because that's what i  hear i don't know what zito does because i don't know if i hear it's a two-man operation they both  work very hard to make sure i like big zito it's ziti's stupid why are you making the words to  different things no such thing as big zito that's what a joke's gotta be it's gotta be real you can't  win with no big zito is stupid you should have said what is he karate kicking like chuck zito or 
[02:13:30]  something that would have been funny because it's the same word sorry chip i try everyone is saying  that that was the wrong clip a couple minutes before that billy goes off sexy five minutes  before the section you guys played everyone is saying it maybe we should get sexy that was almost  them all starting to calm down sexy sexy i thought about you yesterday jimmy because we were talking  about mission impossible ghost protocol i'm i'm stalling hoping that uh iraq maybe has more audio  yes i do have a problem with the movie and it's something you have brought up and i think anthony's 
[02:14:00]  brought up oh guess who the bad guys in the movie of course it's i guarantee you it's not middle  eastern it's the russians of course but i don't even why the russians i don't know i i thought we  were over the russian thing we have been since 1988 so i guess they they picked the safest of course  they did in the middle east they can't have the middle eastern guys be the enemies but you see what  they did they had a massive scene in the movie around dubai which is in the middle east so it's almost  like they're saying well let's we we know what we're really doing here bad people are i think the 
[02:14:30]  last middle eastern bad guy was uh in um that was it hmm that's a good question oh oh uh uh no  why is it the arnold movie well can i ask you a question yeah true lies i guess we all know the  answer when the rocky movie came out where it was all about russian against russia we still had  problems with russia yes how fucked up is that remember that speech though that was so good  but now if we could get along in here in this ring i think the whole world could get along oh 
[02:15:00]  and they have the gorbachev look-alike guy right oh that guy who got a little work yeah for a few  years there a little work a few years terrible is that the speech and does the does the movie uh do  well in russia it probably does if you're a russian and now you got a scene in the rocky movie that's  gotta be all those how long until you get a a chill of douche watching this crack that up let me  let's start how long into a speech do you go like oh shut up cunt let's hear what's the setup this is 
[02:15:30]  after the fight he beats up dolf lundgren which right never happened never right and uh he's in russia  in moscow and they're asking him and he's gonna make a speech with the russians draped in an american  flag yeah and during the cold war and because no one could tell sylvester stallone if you say these  things you will seem like a cheese dick at the end of the movie yeah i don't know he's like hey  and they make the dumb translation yeah they translate uh let's see the rocky four speech  hold on to your face before 
[02:16:00]  i came here tonight i didn't know what to expect  i see a lot of people hating me and don't hate on them i didn't know what to feel about that so  i guess i didn't like you much not either i'm ready to bail yeah yeah it's so bad during this fight  i've seen a lot of changing did you need to see what's our boy i tap that's it right there what 
[02:16:30]  changing uh you didn't see changing you saw fists go into your eyes yeah you saw your wife grab her  vagina falling out to some feet while your fucking turtles were shitting all over doing nothing and your  big dog butt kiss that's the problem was they didn't show you a butt kiss fucking her she was getting humped by  butt kiss that's who that's who the kid was oh shit butt kiss would jump up there butt kiss give her a 
[02:17:00]  good pink dip all right come on let's say a little more come on come on you can make it i apologize  the way you felt about me and the way i felt about you  i was yelling shut off in the crowd they're all quiet you would think there's one yeah there were two  guys showing each other t-rocky  i was right here holy shit that's funny 
[02:17:30]  e-rocky  dolt lundgren  all i knew is i was looking at a bunch of cakes and a bunch of cakes look like they needed  eaten everybody's just slow clap yes yes rocky road  is that the look you were going for you rock oh dolf lundgren look i was cut i was looking through  audio and i just turn it on to you and all i hear is rocky road rocky road oh sorry oh he wasn't 
[02:18:00]  listening to the show he was listening to ron he was trying to find the clip that's what you told  him to find find dude two things at once exactly he's only got the ears i've got two ears  all right let's hear more of a rocky speech  change years ago that's why i'm big i don't know what it looks like that's what's going on  the wallet the polit bureau is there  if i can change oh what tell us right you can change 
[02:18:30]  and you can change the channel  oh  look at the  now the garbage up guy slowly stands up  and starts the slow clap  there's an inspiration  and the hardcore kgb guy is clapping  i'm embarrassed 
[02:19:00]  hey no  i got douchey chilled  we should be home sleeping  oh yeah  oh see he's talking to the little kids out there  now they love you adam  what's the awful music  it's some militant kind of  oh yeah  i'm dancing  what terrible  fucking ending to a movie 
[02:19:30]  i'm doing the gay dance  oh yeah  rocky's stuck on the toilet  like mac dylan's father and crash  would have been a better ending than this  this is hideous  they're applauding the american flag it's the cold one they hated us shut up  apollo feed  he's not even black but all right  hell though if we're going with rocky  oh we have the ron and fez clip 
[02:20:00]  this is the clip everybody's been looking for  the real clip  and are we in agreement  e-rock or is it just okay  no it takes about 30 seconds as it ramps but then it's just yelling for two three minutes  this is it  should we play it after the break  i think we should play it because i have to piss badly  i gotta do uh you know  number two for peeing purposes we gotta do it after the break  all right we'll do that then  ready and  wait  break

[02:30:30]  i'm complimenting you how long have you been doing so you only had to do an hour and a half of bashing  me and zito right it wasn't really it seemed like a bashing and the guy that's gonna help fez wrote  i'll be homo for christmas i didn't i'm not the one who said play it but you have 27 songs on this  dish it's a filthy triple x miss you know what in billy's defense billy wrote that and a long time  ago and we were both different people back then and then what did he say when the song came back 
[02:31:00]  why out of all the songs 27 songs on the cd why come back with that if it's not trying to get it  fez he did that's what he said he goes you know this is just trying to make fez feel bad look it's  hispanics oh shit i'm a dad black people the project song we're and then we have to eventually  hit oh women joy goes around the world and finally gays i'll be homo for christmas i'm just trying to 
[02:31:30]  show the range of it's a triple x miss okay i'm trying to tell you see these billy that's all  oh it's actually three okay if you're gonna do it you can't do anything right you can't even hit  the table if you're gonna copy and mimic do it right okay yeah so mimic shit yeah if you're gonna  copy mick pepper drink a lot don't show up to work and also if you have a daughter don't walk her down  the aisle all right all right you know what i'm not even gonna respond to you i bet you have no right  to fucking say that that's true you have no right to fucking say that i dare you say it to my face 
[02:32:00]  when we walk out in the hall that's not let's not go into that again that's not a good idea he's always  packed oh no i'm fucking telling you that's nowhere for you to go all right well i feel i haven't made  it personal with you have i you called me a poison that didn't feel too fucking good you came in here  told me how i haven't been doing a job that you left 10 years ago well enough i didn't leave 
[02:32:30]  by the way okay what happened then i wasn't asked of course the station flipped  oh so you're okay fired no i was retired sounds like a firing billy guy don't you guys know the  radio fucking business don't you know how it works you're in the goddamn radio business keep telling  me come on okay when ron and fess left florida how many guys did they bring with them okay when  ron and fess left florida how many guys did you bring up to dc with okay when you're going from dc  to new how many did you bring with you when you went from d uh j w to jfk in here am i in 
[02:33:00]  fucking harvard there's none is this hard oh no it's serious xm on the walls shit don't don't go  where you don't belong he went too personal talking about your daughter yeah  and that is fucking real i say i can hear it in you you're being a wise ass and putting fez down  and being fucking critical of him all the time and coming back with i'll be homo for christmas 
[02:33:30]  you know what don't fucking sit that stare there and glare through the glass like you're some piece  of fucking royal shit okay because you're nothing you're putting down a man who's done more than  you'll ever do in your fucking life the uh the thing about your daughter who did walk her  her mother  which in a sense makes sense but he's still hurtful but like why why is that even zito's business  it's not it's not his business it's just something we talked about a while ago 
[02:34:00]  it's awesome you realized it was uncomfortable and you moved on i moved out of it i said this is  personal he's fucking playing you're stupid holy shit ronnie is playing the room play in the room  the puppet master oh he's fantastic which he'll never admit obviously but that's brilliant it's  brilliant radio and right in front of billy's face ronnie's saying way worse yeah and billy staples  i hate to tear down the fucking curtain but i got it so good  saying way worse right to his face yeah yeah but he's able to do it that way brilliant go ahead 
[02:34:30]  but like why why is that even zito's business it's not it's not his business it's just something we  talked about a while ago right and you realized it was uncomfortable and you moved on i moved out of  it i said this is personal stuff but then again i want everybody to feel good about themselves  mm-hmm hey look i've been through some horrible up and down and shit in my life that no one even 
[02:35:00]  has an idea of so um yeah i have a little short fuse when it comes to some things and and by who it  comes from right like normally you're pretty easy going but in that case you got pissed cliff go  ahead buddy i don't know well do you want do you want to keep going because i didn't get  past this what the fuck are we doing well let's just let's just hear if the phone caller says  anything nasty yeah okay um afternoon gentlemen i'm i know billy is trying to help fez but i think 
[02:35:30]  he's doing him a disservice by reminding him what he used to do i think says needs to understand that  he can be brilliant um at any time look how well he was during that whole thanksgiving uh  meal preparation he was great that day he did but he made great food that's a good point  um let's go over here uh to pk you're on a fence hey 3201 ronnie yeah uh first of all the 
[02:36:00]  orange one failure is a douche he stinks and uh the only reason fez agrees with him is because it  allows fez's problems or whatever to be put on to other people so how was that job for uh how is that  happening what do you mean how's it happening how is fez being putting his problems on other people  because you're letting zito and uh my man over there take the blame for him screwing up i've  admitted all my screw ups today you're an arse ball of failure you screwed the pooch years ago and now  you come back in and cause trouble go fuck yourself that's a great reply that's a good answer what you 
[02:36:30]  don't like the answer it's true no go fuck yourself no you're asked a question on how it works oh jesus  don't look what they're playing i've got those music cues going what is this no his father passed  away no got to give credit where credit's due though wow they are brutal what's this by the way g  back wrote in uh billy sounds as sharp as a tack made my daddy here i'm so passionate we can see it 
[02:37:00]  all right yeah where did billy's father die no i think i was doing it like a fez thing right there oh  oh yeah you sure i think so i don't i don't know i don't know because i was thinking that because  billy staples didn't walk his daughter down the aisle is that her wedding song or something it  was tied to play a father song oh billy's dad died on a fishing trip i guess okay so they played  that that's because that's known as the dead father song in the living years yeah mike and the mechanics 
[02:37:30]  yeah mike and the mechanics it was a good song oh god depressing lump of shit not a fan of the  the uh depressing songs i don't like those songs that have meanings that might grab at a  fucking emotion yeah fuck that noise do you remember listening to it has i was i love all no no i said  listening to not jerking off shit ah because i told you that irish folk music that guy uh oh yeah 
[02:38:00]  that's his fucking name why me with the uh eric bogle no no no not the pokes eric bogle i've been  loving it that's yeah i think all those folksy like uh you are eclectic jimmy it's the song i like so  much is uh uh and now i'm easy i think we talked about it already but it's so good yeah yeah about an  old cocky and australia ready to die you're looking all right he likes a good story i really do  edmund fitzgerald all those stories the uh the same guy who wrote uh the uh and the band played 
[02:38:30]  the waltzing matilda right i love that shit you like a good story i love a good story like a good  story jimmy's a story song guy oh we did this oh we did that one already i was gonna go with now i'm  easy but sam found the wrong one no sam has found the right one iraq's playing that why would iraq do  that i apologize iraq has blonde hair iraq i want to see red brain matter in that hair because i was  playing something while i thought sam was looking for the other song i apologize iraq that was harsher 
[02:39:00]  oh sam now he's going after you no it's been on the screen he was covering for you  it's been on the screen but he's already so why don't you tell iraq that i know that you know that  it's been on the screen for 30 seconds fine you produce the show don't make fun of pepper hicks  that's that cool iraq you're getting attention your hair is blonde blondes are dumb right  i don't have to do fake stuff exactly they have more fun though yeah are you having more fun since  you became a blonde oh yeah in what way are guys hooting and hollering at you when you walk down 
[02:39:30]  the side called by construction workers are you jane mansfield i wish it would end this  let's ask him though what has changed since you've become a blondie nothing really you sure yeah  yeah there's a lot of people telling me how much they hate my hair  now that's true yes it's only because of the empty coconut that it's covering 
[02:40:00]  coconuts are so dumb oh they really are especially blonde coconuts  yeah oh boy iraq okay yeah let's talk about hulk hogan oh we have that uh  whole thing where he's suing he's suing his uh ex-wife because she made gay allegations  called him uh homo saying she really saying uh he might have been gay with uh brutus  brutus the barber beefcake yeah who wouldn't be though didn't we play that clip when she first  said it yeah do we have that handy um yeah i'm sure it's online basically we're saying there's a 
[02:40:30]  lot of uh uh gay activities some of the you know gay and there might have been some gay with uh the  hulk and brutus the barber is brutus also suing oh yeah but he needs the cash ban do we have the  original clip or we don't um one who's gonna cover that for her she did she say it in her book  no she said it on a radio interview that's was she promoting the book uh oh was it our 
[02:41:00]  fucking show no it's not our show i wonder if she's uh well we would have been smart enough to go well  we don't you know yeah well we don't know but tell us more two lawsuits that sucks huh yeah yeah  i don't know where the original clip is do you think there's maybe a chance we can kind of get  some of the money back that you have to work over the problem is i went through a nasty divorce  i had everything in the book thrown at me if i even looked the wrong way they were trying to put me  in jail about one time was there mention of abuse or battery or any type of gay affairs actually out of 
[02:41:30]  all the accusations my infidelity she never mentioned bruce the barber beefcake once so if i was gay i'd be  proud of it you know yeah yeah so yeah that's the thing i was going to ask the whole thing's  ridiculous but you know what you can't lie you can't discriminate you can't defame people and act  like a bully above the law it's over i'm done with it and my buddy bruce their 50 year old daughter  who's got to listen to this crowd yeah man that's tough this is a real mrs hoban brother you know 
[02:42:00]  there she is linda bollet linda clerich and every name is this is you hate me so much  using my name oh yeah yeah why does she continue to hate she got everything  she got an unbelievable settlement i hate when they continue using the name  who do i fucking hate they should be forced to stop they should legally yes you should no longer  be allowed you're not allowed to do that why do they continue to use i don't fucking know the ex  husband who paid should be allowed to name them yes oh man they'd be a phone book full of cunts 
[02:42:30]  yeah i know it'll be two pages of a and b c would be 1600 or you can't be a separate phone  book here's your phone book and here's your cunt phone yes the new cunt book c-u-n-t through and  are you trying to say that your ex has your last name uh well you know uh yeah wow i would like to  why why would you do that i don't know you would think if everything was so bad why the  fuck cling on why would you have any reminder of that exactly that's fucked up especially in this case 
[02:43:00]  since hogan is not his last name yeah no it's terry what why why do you think she still is your last  name i don't know to torture me more i have no idea i think it's not illegal that is so  fucking once you're married they get the fucking name there's nothing you could do about it and  there's nothing we could do about it yes couldn't be helped he's gone uh by the way we we got it  for the show we got it wrong again the kev higgs on twitter writes um blondes have more 
[02:43:30]  funyuns or blondes have more ton i thought yeah too mean it is the funyuns yeah no no no the ton  funyuns is funny and your mother said i'm not losing a daughter i'm gaining a ton  ramden how funny is that i'm gaining a ton ton and alice starts laughing why don't you shut up  god that was a funny show losing a daughter i'm gaining a ton hilarious well i don't want my

[02:44:30]  i don't think we feel like fucking trying to make it better i'm a hulk yeah that was just you know  whatever it was i like his renaissance spots i feel bad i really feel bad for hulk who's with him  troy aikman yep also those are great newly divorced these christmas ads that are coming on uh i saw one  last night for a a pawn shop that said your holiday shopping headquarters jesus and i just thought it's  like yeah what about the rest of the chess pieces oh it's not just pawns oh it's a bunch of small 
[02:45:00]  shrimps the rook shop no no it's it's some like pawn uh chain place like a chain store of pawn shops  and and they show people going in and shopping like for tvs and it looks all nice and power tools  and it's like your one-stop holiday shopping headquarters like a punch weird it just i felt a  little like yeah i don't think that's your one-stop holiday uh shopping uh place their pawn shop 
[02:45:30]  speaking which would you ever buy uh dead lady jewelry uh not if i knew it was dead lady jewelry well  obviously it is what is oh oh at the pawn shop could just be stolen well you got the guys on the  street and uh they're selling jewelry and and you gotta watch this watch this watch this no it's it's  it's old rings and necklaces and and baubles yeah and and all i could think and and it's obviously  antiquey yeah like that's just dead lady jewelry that's creepy from the guy that used to wear a finger 
[02:46:00]  bone around his neck ah true i learned though man i got rid of that shit bad vibes but i think if you  you pass down a ring or something in your own family that's one thing but to all of a sudden  just like buy dead lady jewelry on the street that's creepy to me is it sold that way marketed dead lady  jewelry well they should put up a sign i'm thinking i have a ring for my grandfather my mother's father  but he was cool he was that but he was a real motherfucker and i kind of want to get rid of it  do you see a sign that says dead lady jewelry wait why was he a motherfucker just a dick 
[02:46:30]  i think he's just an asshole then that means that ring has fucking been squished into a lot  of faces over the years yeah i just i don't want it i want to get rid of it what was his uh main uh  malfunction just anger i think i never met him he died before i was born or sell it or pawn it  i want to sell it i want to sell it i'm just thinking it's been in the family for years  what kind of ring is it my drawer it's a gold ring a little diamond i mean again nothing that's  i don't know what it's worth it was your grandpa's yeah what what do i want it for 
[02:47:00]  pass it on for what does smell like grandma's snatch yeah no there's a there's a much bigger  ring this one was too small this was one of the ones that didn't slip off his finger and get lost  her vagina was known by the way as the fucking as the as the ring sinkhole when she died they  rung around like a fucking a rag and fucking three watches four rings and a fucking mets hat fell out  uh let's go to joe de rosa joe i think you were supposed to go see joe uh last night i ran into

[02:53:00]  they're like assholes so if we don't push it if we don't sell tickets caroline's yeah then it forces  us to do the right thing and push because we want to make sure we still have the heat so we could drink  for free and shit in there caroline's has been amazing for every fucking minute we've been in new  york during the comedy business they understand we're just walking around yeah no i know i'm just saying  i'm just saying though like isn't it amazing that every single minute we've been here they've been  cool yeah even when we were out of work they were still oh my god those two years i still got two  years i was able to go down and i was all willing to pay and everything i just wanted to see uh you 
[02:53:30]  know comics that we knew and uh greg would just be like ah take a seat over here and let me tell  you something man when you lose your gig people fucking say goodbye to you not caroline's and they  could be almost karen i'm in prison they're not gonna do anything while we're as long as i'm in  here they could be the only ones that didn't uh turn their backs on us gotta take care of ourselves  that's what it is people stop taking their calls all sorts of shit happen yeah just uh it sucks they 
[02:54:00]  just casually say hi to you in the hallway now oh boy jerk jerks fucking jerk you know we are giving  new people the opportunity to do nude oh oh new oh to join the the opian anthony totally dude in  turns totally dude hey what the fuck why don't we hear any more scorch he started doing a different  show what is he doing well then why didn't we hear that what's he doing because it's like  what's wrong with you it's like an interview show where he's just interviewing like that's  beautiful dude i gotta hear something he's probably just interviewing sponsors 
[02:54:30]  hey so what do you do he's just interviewing like bad bands and stuff fantastic it's perfect  for us okay i'll get some but what i was going to say was uh we're trying to get some new interns  speaking of totally nude yeah having some totally nude no they don't have to be nude why are we  getting rid of we have more time with our interns no we have one day left well we have more time  with sal and then the other one just has tomorrow is sal gonna continue with us sal will be  why is how come nobody likes matt i i really don't get it he's rubbed where have you been 
[02:55:00]  for the past no no i mean i've been here like and i understand like like when he first came in  he had a great appearance on the occupy wall street it was interesting he has a good radio  voice he was fun to listen to everybody liked in that first appearance it'd be the biggest drop  off in ona history oh my god and we quite some drop off but pavel francisco what  what was that but he was just an eager guy like he's he's not an entertainer so it's like yeah of  course he wants to get back on but you don't get on mike yeah period but i'm saying you don't when 
[02:55:30]  you're not in like that's pathetic for like if there's a comedian doing that or an actor you're  like oh you douche but a guy who's an intern who's showing that he's willing to do anything to get on  mike no no doing anything to get on mike would be you know working being a good intern and then you get  your mic time like he's starting fake fights and trying to drum up controversy and not very hokey  not learning okay anything behind the scenes very very hokey i think we should hear his side of it 
[02:56:00]  though i mean i don't like i don't want to sign with anybody yeah he was he was talking about  me he's really pissed at ant yeah he's pissed why why because yesterday i don't think he turned  oh because he could have felt up boobies but is he here but he couldn't because uh the company  wouldn't allow that he couldn't because the company wouldn't allow we could have made believe  like we're usually doing you know should we get it let me get to hear what he says  that's his last day right tomorrow's his last day yeah i don't give a  shit if you guys have fun with this piece i'm honestly curious to why you've asked me for that  i just said yeah i don't care if he's on the air he's already at the fucking door you called him 
[02:56:30]  all greasy and everything yes well he looked like a madman uh oh now he's not going to walk in  but no kenny kenny stopped him oh no kenny let him in what are you doing well yesterday kenny  yeah i just want to double check no he wants to he's an intern yeah take a seat there alfalfa  schweitzer there he goes hi man your hair looks a little drier today yeah i didn't uh it was a bit  greasy yesterday come on now if there was a picture of you when you walked in that door 
[02:57:00]  it looked like you were fucking you should have been on breaking bad i just wanted to you  don't do it all nice yesterday yeah do it all nice i hear you yeah so uh so you got two days left  uh what day and a half today's almost done yeah yeah so you pretty much got one more day as an  intern how do you think the internship went i think it went great yeah yeah i uh i enjoyed it i had a great  time um you're an idiot you know he is dumb i got some air time which was cool but that wasn't what 
[02:57:30]  it was all about did you learn anything i learned a lot about the broadcasting business yeah yeah um  sure did learn a lot i learned a lot apparently including the basics yeah all the basics pretty  much what'd you learn about the broadcasting business well you know it's a tough business i  mean it's not easy to break into it's not easy to get your voice heard what's rule one of broadcasting  i'm gonna i'm gonna give you your sure isn't easy to get your your quiz voice heard i'm giving you  your first uh what's rule one of broadcasting i have no idea uh you said you learned a lot so what 
[02:58:00]  would what would the answer be what's rule one of broadcasting it's obvious is it um  what would you say the most address i don't i don't what would you say we are literally talking  about rule number one what would you say the most um huh that's probably the best that's a good one  you realize your mic hasn't been on the entire fucking time well touche touche touche you got  you it's still not yes he did you got you oh well you gotta admit you were you were you were a little 
[02:58:30]  more into the air time than you were about the you know mundane aspect of interning right yeah yeah  yeah yeah you know our boss uh gary not even our like our your boss idiot sorry you don't want me  not chuck roast no no chuck roast first tier boss what the fuck is chuck roast oh you don't know  about chuck roast that wasn't rob's on air name yes it was well if you insist on saying that but you 
[02:59:00]  would be i know it was it's terrible chuck roast chuck roast who's his partner rump  chuck chuck chuck and rump roast i love it so you're idiot boss not ours you're right you're  right um we officially don't have one good for you yes uh but gary who's even one tier above chuck  roast yeah he said to matt on matt's very first day matt how was your first day as an intern and 
[02:59:30]  matt looked at him and said i don't know kind of boring i was being honest that's good that was  his first impression he made on his boss but now just being in a place uh should be exciting just  being in the radio environment stuff should be exciting so even if you were doing you know boring  stuff you're here that's kind of that's 99 of the battle right there it is very exciting yeah i mean  it's more exciting to be in here but it's exciting why do you think people didn't like you because i like 
[03:00:00]  you but that's a really good question why do you think why do you think you rub every pretty much  everyone the wrong way i think in a couple instances it's been jealousy in other instances  i mean fair enough when do you think it's been jealousy well i mean obviously with sal um  he's jealous yeah how is he jealousy you because he's the golden boy of interns right he's gonna end up  getting a job out of this yeah well maybe i mean it's not even i would say they don't really hire much 
[03:00:30]  out of here that's no everybody that we have working for us started as an intern yeah they  don't hire but how many interns our whole staff was hired and they were interns and they still  continue to hire the better interns but you have interns go salad it will absolutely be hired by this  company right well so why would he be jealous of you i don't get it well i mean why are you like this  it's frustrating because you're like this because you could be a cool kid like stop i sounds not jealous of  you is he even here he would say this yeah he's here you want him in yes you got some kind of 
[03:01:00]  weird social problem you got you don't get along well with people you get along because you say  stupid okay i get along well with some people and other people not so well like there's several  people here name one person that you get along with who absolutely loves roland mars  they absolutely love yes do you love you like matt wait wait first ask him how often he deals with  matt and then ask him all right how often do you deal with uh matt never all right and do you like him 
[03:01:30]  i like what he riles you guys oh yeah okay yeah i can respect that and roland but he doesn't  roland's coming wait wait mars does he like do you like him as a person i don't give a  a fuck either way and roland is is you know the underhanded by far biggest  in the building way bigger than me it's creepy you're kind of delusional nobody likes you i've  i've had no one on staff likes you i disagree mars just proved it he doesn't give a fuck he likes 
[03:02:00]  what you bring to the show but that's different than actually liking you as a person can i chime in  for a second are you jealous of matt i am completely jealous of matt i mean it's just there's so many  things i wish i could do and be like him and aspire to him so maybe next semester i'm going to try to  do more things just like matt that should be easy and oh and the other thing he's completely delusional  about is how uh he thinks that roland likes him i roland every minute he gets a moment to tell me  something he always just goes fucking matt he fucking sucks i know riles him up so much the second 
[03:02:30]  he said roland though loves me and stuff i in my own head not even knowing the situation i know  roland doesn't like him he does i've had many meaningful conversations with roland actual  conversations not just behind your back a lot of them he's a foot away laughing roland honestly  not for a bit or anything yes do you like him i enjoy pumping him up so he's like excited you  might give me a coke yes i will for you anything you want do you know why we're all like to pop  him up music because there's nothing that brings roland joy more joy even than anyone else on staff 
[03:03:00]  roland fucks with e-rock way worse than anybody so what he likes to do is pump up matt's ego and  since e-rock is the intern boss get matt to start talking back and frustrating that's why  rolling gameplay doesn't understand the real reason why this shit goes down that's what he said too he  said plural jealousy like it's not just yeah yeah who else who else is jealous of you uh i mean i think 
[03:03:30]  danny was a little bit of jealous of some of the attention and time i got are you kidding me  oh no good night here you go danny would be jealous of you maybe and for what why well just some of the  you know uh air time and attention i got now don't you think danny gets a lot of air time well not nearly  as much as other people you know like sam don't drag me into this let me tell you something danny was in  the studio danny chose to get an off air out of studio position because he likes it better to be 
[03:04:00]  able to you know get shit together for the show and more of a behind the scenes he didn't want to be  what whoa that's it go on facebook whoa oh shit oh did you hear what he said while you were walking  ross aunt said uh that you like to here you go i go yeah danny was on the air but the and and  in studio and he took the position he voluntarily and took a behind the scenes position and and danny  has an open mic he could be on whenever the fuck you want and matt said yeah you mean go on facebook 
[03:04:30]  oh as if to say you do nothing well if let's say i went on facebook all day that's 300 more work  than you do here okay oh and he's right i am kind of jealous of him because i would like to finger  girls and get my own breakfast so that would be kind of nice well go do that i mean don't go go bring  your girlfriend in here every fucking friday to show everyone off that i brought her in once  three you brought her in three times i whatever and what are you trying to make what does that have 
[03:05:00]  to do with it i don't know bring her in just as oh yeah i got a hot girlfriend what is you  pray about girls all the time well that's just that's just lying i think i've had a guest here i  think one time it was more than once when everybody brings their girl in it means they're showing off  for something well yeah i mean one time troy brought her into and i mean she's fucking hot  but that's it's not just maybe you doing something or she's got nowhere to go for when i was when you  came in on saturday and jess was here was that me being like oh yeah it's gonna be here no i mean 
[03:05:30]  she had a reason to be here she had to videotape east side dave that's a reason i don't know if  that's a shot or not i can't know i can't either i can't tell it's attempted i think now why would i  take a shot why do you think danny's jealous of you like he's got he's got an on-air gig here if  he wants it yeah i mean i mean i don't know what happened but for some reason like on the pro tools  thing in there it still says danny as uh mike number five but obviously the whole semester i've been  here look you're you're setting up a case that danny's not jealous of me danny may get along just 
[03:06:00]  fine you said danny was jealous of you but you're not saying don't bring me it definitely doesn't  say mike five is matt and it wasn't important enough to change the name on them what's wrong  with you it makes no difference it doesn't make a difference he's jealous of me he doesn't want  to be on the air and he got a hot girlfriend the name the name is still my name because mars is lazy  yeah there you go but that's a good name that's a good label  but who would who would even notice that i didn't i don't know what yeah i didn't 
[03:06:30]  observe and he takes little things and makes a big shit out of it that with this delusional  twist to it is what i see you are delusional delusional is an excellent word because i've  never seen i've never seen somebody feel that they're more deserving for having done absolutely  nothing i understand the game for what it is all right as you guys need interns to do  shit work for you guys and interns want to come and be a part of the the show for a couple months and 
[03:07:00]  feel special because they get to have their voice heard all right so that's more than that if you  got skills it leads yeah some people some people want to be in the business and they want to learn  and they want they take the internship as an opportunity to learn what running a radio show  really is and doing the work that leads to you know to getting that job you just showed up and  instantly decided that i i just want attention i want to be on air now i'm not saying that's a bad  goal for somebody who wants to be in the business but you can't you can't start talking about how  how you're deserving and people are jealous of somebody who just showed up and didn't do anything 
[03:07:30]  ah well if you did something that was worth me being jealous of i would absolutely be i'm just not  because you haven't every time i was on the air even though it was a couple times that i was on for  more than five minutes uh you seem to be even more i argued with you because i argued with you  because you made you made asinine points about whatever the argument was that was taking place  yeah i'm never jealous of of your on-air uh talents and abilities talking about oh no you  don't know what you're talking about we already got past all this we're not going to rehash it i 
[03:08:00]  don't want you talk out of your ass you you repeat things that you've read somewhere else on  somebody's blog and then you treat it like it's the fact because you read it and you you treat  you treat um memorizing things and knowledge as the same thing when it's different all right go back  on facebook oh man well maybe i will after you rebut what i've just said to you there's nothing  for me to rebut i come on the air and i just make a lot of noise and because i'm the loudest i win 
[03:08:30]  the game is that what you're doing right now no that's what you're doing what do you what's your  response matt well is that he's completely wrong i mean i do know what i'm talking about i didn't do my  research doo-doo yes i said doo-doo what are you gonna do after the internship what research do you  do all i see you doing in the back office is reading magazines anyway so what do you do oh  what magazine there's no matter if there's a maxim or a penthouse laying around i see sal on computers  i see sal with headphones on he's making production he's getting f you calls he's putting that together 
[03:09:00]  i see you just sitting around that well honestly it's just what i see so sometimes there's nothing to  do and sometimes there's never nothing to do there's always you know when there's nothing to do  you just repeated that because danny said it a couple weeks ago oh man dr gay dr gay dr gay  diagnosis i wasn't going to get involved but but when matt comes in here and says oh i know the game  uh interns are here to do you know crap work but but sal has done more work as an intern someone 
[03:09:30]  take tries the shoes off than any intern since sam which was yeah like four years ago so no matt  that's not the game the game is what you make it when he says there's nothing to do wouldn't you  assume that like during that time you could maybe write a bit or or learn some production or or put  something together where you can hand it in and say hey guys check this out you know or something  i not just sit around and go i'm waiting for somebody give me something to do right that would  be the normal approach but matt's approach is just look at nhl.com and pretend like he's doing some 
[03:10:00]  research for the show i did try i never pretended once that i was doing this will be a blown  opportunity for you so what what happens next uh for matt daddy will take care of him well like sal is  staying on and pat duffy's now mad at me but the fact is there it's different skill sets and i see  that they might might end up you know hiring sal down the road for production or something there are  multiple channels i would love to hire pat duffy trust me you know sal came in here with a background 
[03:10:30]  in production his he studied for four years in college production and what you do study fingering  girls so but he studied like seven or eight years in college but decided that he's not sure if he  wants to finish but i still have a lot since i've been here i still haven't learned the entire dynamic  of how a radio show works i never knew i screened phone calls before i got here and now i'm the best  phone screener on the staff right you didn't answer my question what where do you go from where does  he get this from i don't know delusional where where do you go from here i haven't decided yet 
[03:11:00]  um what are your choices okay well i'm gonna go back home i'm gonna i i might go on julia another  adventure to be honest i might uh i kind of want to travel out west and see uh colorado and see you  want to be a bum jules he's a free spirit i've never been on a walk the earth want to get into  adventure is there a graduate school for uh nhl umpires what he hasn't even had an  nhl umpire yet travis don't don't you go to umpire don't you go to umpire school it's baseball 
[03:11:30]  you dumb fuck oh you got me nhl umpires sorry like the rest of the world i don't watch hockey  danny once danny once summed up matt's um train of thought perfectly it's psycho  babble there's no rhyme or reason just keep repeating shit danny says because i like this  kid because i love that's the exact reason no no but it's true he just  fucking regurgitates anything why don't you have one a thought of your own for once and stop repeating 
[03:12:00]  everything eroc says or danny's far wall street on a bank loan from his father oh  when are you gonna get serious about your life you're gonna travel out west that sounds great but when are  you gonna actually do something uh with your life career wise a job wise i've had an incredible  amount of experiences i think to be honest with it if i'm gonna analyze myself i probably have a fear of 
[03:12:30]  like getting into something getting stuck in it because i've kind of bounced around and tried a  whole bunch of different things i'm like oh yeah i'm gonna be a pro umpire oh fuck i'm gonna work in  radio all right i'm gonna be a comedian but i've never had the so wait you i thought you said you  weren't you didn't go to umpire school but you say umpire and it's okay i say umpire it's baseball  you said nhl umpire that's what doesn't idiot it doesn't matter anyone who's ever watched sports  in their lives know that exactly so there's no umpires in hockey and there's it's baseball so what 
[03:13:00]  so what sport aren't you going to work for which is the one that you went to school for that you're  not going to be in as a career is it nhl or and or mlb i'm confused as far as what whatever i as far as  as far as you wasting your father's money on other things besides college i i've been a hockey  referee and i've been a baseball for the dwarf giraffe league who what for little league  what where have you been doing this refereeing uh baseball i've done high school oh wow shit uh 
[03:13:30]  hockey i've done up to juniors damn you know what i take i take back what i've said i'm sorry you're  really going places i don't care i really cannot give a shit have you ever scored three goals in one  game yes holy have you ever scored with two chicks at the same time yeah throw it in you  have a finger girls downtown no yes wow you got things going on that's right hey i heard a rumor  going around that you fucked a big fat girl here is that true yeah oh she she denies it she denies  it oh i don't oh wow really there's no reason i mean since intern matt is just the coolest cat in 
[03:14:00]  the world i was just curious as to some of the fucking it shouldn't be brought up probably yeah he  likes to bring up uh he likes to bring up other people's girlfriends so let's talk about all the  fucking pigs he's fucking oh fucking pigs matt did you bang a fatty well i respect that but i can't  do it she was she wasn't huge i mean she wasn't thin but she wasn't huge all right it was the one  that the one time i was on yeah yeah yeah she wasn't that big i didn't see her i just saw the 
[03:14:30]  pussy i mean i wanted to see it i wanted to see it she's showing the pussy can we go home yeah you can  continue this on the shit show i don't want him on the head i don't know i still don't know i  understand he's a little abrasive but i don't know why everybody listen to him everybody has a real  people don't like him he's very you're too confrontational for no reason like you are  confrontational for no reason all of a sudden it's just you're abrasive you know what he does he talks  shit and talks shit and if it's about a topic that he's read about he can argue it because he he's got 
[03:15:00]  the paragraphs in his head ready to go but when the minute that you you confront him on something  where there hasn't been a blog written about it he doesn't know how to respond so he just goes  whatever matter or he'll behave the way he behaved yesterday it was when he just when he decided that  he had nothing to say because he doesn't doesn't have a lot going on upstairs he'll just not look at  you and just not respond to things that you're saying like a fucking 13 year old girl would do to  their parents a stupid one well why the anger it's because you're delusional man i feel bad 
[03:15:30]  for you actually oh boy yeah i don't even hate you i don't feel bad for me he's got a problem with  danny too he's been he's been taking little jabs at danny yeah why do you have a problem with danny  uh i just never have had a meaningful real conversation with him i've actually  i have to have one with you it would just be nice i mean but who have you had a meaningful  conversation with everyone everyone here really except for daniel sam yeah meaningful what kind  of a meaningful conversation have no way eric yeah with even with eric meaning no yeah even 
[03:16:00]  eric you want to chime in because you're any tell any conversation i had with him is because he he  directly disobeyed anything we told him to do uh that's not a conversation that's not a meaningful  conversation or if we told him to do um this certain thing he he thinks like i'm gonna go over  and see if maybe i could talk to anthony for a few minutes during the break when did i ever do that  it just keeps going back to being you told sal to go do stuff that i specifically told you to do so 
[03:16:30]  you could go get anthony's cup of ice so you can maybe have an encounter with him and talk to him  so he'd recognize you did sal tell you to say that no you admitted you admitted to me when i confronted  you on it the second day this is why nobody likes you love a good encounter with me it keeps going  back to delusional that's what's weird yeah everything's delusional i don't think you've  had meaningful conversations i think matt's saying just get over it right it was the second day exactly  i understand three months ago he feels like he really does feel like he deserves to be in here 
[03:17:00]  on the air for all of this by the way yeah yeah yeah well why don't we get back to what started all  this with him being so pissed off that anthony denied him from coming to the studio yeah you're right  about daddy rock he was super pissed at aunt yesterday remember matt yeah i was pretty  pissed off he was gonna bring me in to uh to you know do what i can with the girl and then you're  like no that's right he said it's not your decision yeah and then i reminded him that your name is in  the marquee it's the opie and anthony show and he said yeah opie and anthony oh yes you did you 
[03:17:30]  i absolutely believe you would say something i had to say you douche how far down is matt on the  fucking list and but he didn't refer to you as anthony the bottom oh what was i that fucking guy  no i didn't come on i did not say that that fucking guy i did not say that  you're bothered you couldn't come in and feel porn star i was i was i think most guy would have been  bothered by that because i know i would have been my thought was because he talks a good game with 
[03:18:00]  the ladies and let's see what the and i would have done a good job that was my thought i was  right though because the intern the company would give us you know i can't have interns the company  wouldn't allow and i wanted to care about that we told him that and he said so he seems to think  that we all value his pleasure more than our jobs yeah i i didn't believe it at first i believe  am i now am i jealous too am i jealous too i don't think so what do you mean you don't think so  what do you think you might have a lot of anger i don't think i have anger towards who i just think 
[03:18:30]  in general you have a lot of anger oh you think i do yeah you're always yelling and screaming and  you have a kind of a closed view of life and you have hatred towards certain people and don't take  the bait you know it's just it is what it is i mean wow all right basically what he's saying he's  got me down saying fuck you is what he said he's trying to have a meaningful conversation not that  there's things about you that i don't respect oh good wow now i can sleep tonight you know i 
[03:19:00]  like you like young girls i like young girls okay that's a good thing that you like baseball i like  baseball so yeah yeah okay we got a lot in common you think that's a funny guy i do i think he's very  funny oh boy i know now i don't know what to say you know the opie honestly guy show that  fucking guy i mean thank you sam i mean ultimately i'm just a fan but before i got here you were my  favorite oh well now i know i know where it turned besides this is when we started really 
[03:19:30]  going and discussing the occupy wall street stuff he'd be back here saying how fucking delusional  you were i'm with some of your views as far as uh yeah speaking out against the occupy wall street  people you know life experience uh does account for a lot when you uh when you look at the world you  know yeah maybe one day you know but i mean i don't think your basic views of life have probably  changed that much over no they have time they have yeah how do you how are you how do you think that 
[03:20:00]  you have a view of life oh yes opie please what whoa getting comfy in the chair oh wow  nothing changed i'm still on a microphone so why the comment now so much what's the comment  oh man okay so what makes your question what do you want oh i'm sorry it's the intern match show  apparently yeah yeah uh well my question was uh what makes you feel that you have all this life  experience to talk about it well i i'm here i'm on earth i've been on earth 25 years but what what 
[03:20:30]  what jobs have you held have you ever been on your own i mean what have you done i fucking traveled  the world on my own that's not on your own so what job so what so what job did you what job did you  work for and save money to afford these yeah yeah how'd you how'd you afford the trips when  you're given things to travel the world it's not you travel that's not an accomplishment you have  a different view of even the world when you're traveling the world on someone else's dime let me  be honest with you if you earn that money you would have a different appreciation the real world has 
[03:21:00]  never smashed you in the face nope and i can't wait for it this is the close i mean i've gotten punched  in my face quite a bit which you probably never have we're talking i've been punched in the face  believe it or not yes you've been in a fight i think we've absolutely have been oh is that  does he want to do you want to fight me no because that's not exactly a sign of intelligence when you  start running your mouth screaming how you want to fight people i don't fight the other day uh  mac goes he said he asked me he said have you ever been arrested i said no i've never been arrested in 
[03:21:30]  my entire life yeah and that admits to me he's been arrested between 25 and 30 times that's not an  admission that's a lie he hasn't been no no but he even said he can't go to canada because he's had a dui  he's lying to you he's a shit yeah what have you been arrested for uh drinking pot what's the  worst times worst thing you're not supposed to drink it stupid yeah no dwi was ours 187 on an  undercover cop oh yeah i think that's why he's so upset that he's not coming back is because he's  been given so much in his life well that's why he was down at wall street too give me give me 
[03:22:00]  give me it's just more of that attitude carrying over that now we're not giving him another semester  okay i i never expected it i never expected to come back i i knew i'd burn my bridges here pretty  quickly it's okay jim likes you though it's not it's not a matter of burning bridges it's just that  you didn't do anything like if you understand you could have the worst attitude in the world but if  you really if you did great things and you made this great shit you'd say you know what intern  matt's he's kind of a cunt but look at all this great stuff but we don't have all that great stuff 
[03:22:30]  you know there's no great stuff from you at the very least i provided some entertainment for you  people that's a and and that's exactly what it was the very least but we could have literally we  could have dragged and we have anyone from the street up here and they could have given us the  same thing all right i did tell him there's an intern met every semester yeah yeah that's another  thing he really he really thinks that he's this unique case like we've never seen this guy before  but you know he's just he's just another your cookie cutter intern gardener in platoon 
[03:23:00]  am i yeah so take a hike love buzz or whatever exactly i don't love buzz whatever it is unless  mars can hook you up with something in the engineering department yeah i did have a dream  about that he's your boy i also i had a dream the other night that i was staying in your house  and so was sal and sal was in my room and i was trying to sleep and sal was walking around just  muttering to himself about something korean some korean that i'm yeah i'm fucking crazy  yeah why are you in matt's room at anthony's house yeah it's his dream this is a symbolic 
[03:23:30]  dream of this place dr gays anthony's house right this is anthony's house this is work and it's  about you and him at work i don't know exactly what the korean thing is maybe it meant that like  sal was like constantly bothering me or talking about things that you don't understand like maybe  the korean was something you would understand okay so maybe you're both at anthony's house  and he's muttering in korean and he's speaking a language you don't understand something you don't  understand like broadcasting stuff right honestly yeah that okay that makes sense stuff yeah that 
[03:24:00]  no that actually might make sense like you know like check the levels it might not be korean  all right look i'd love to continue this but uh i got a long drive you have to finish this with matt  tomorrow i hate to see him go but yeah well it has to happen the last day well we'll say uh adios to  you uh tomorrow maybe you should co-host tomorrow i don't know oh yeah  maybe maybe yeah take uh you know that other fucking guy's spot and then i can stay home well
