<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion about Tiger Woods’ recently surfaced photograph leaving a Mississippi sex rehab clinic, dubbed "Gentle Path" by the hosts, who nicknamed Woods "Tiger Hood."  The hosts and callers speculated wildly and with vulgar language about the nature of Woods’ rehab, debating whether he was genuinely a sex addict or merely seeking PR rehabilitation after his numerous infidelities.  A caller who had been in rehab shared their experiences, while others debated the validity of "sex addiction" itself, contrasting Woods' situation with that of other athletes like A-Rod.  The discussion included graphic sexual descriptions, jokes about Woods’ appearance, and analysis of the "Disclosure Day" aspect of his rehab.  The expensive cabin renovation Woods reportedly received at the facility was also a point of contention.

The show then featured a seemingly disinterested phone interview with Edward Norton, followed by criticism of exploitative reality shows like "Celebrity Rehab" with Dr. Drew, including a clip of Mindy McCready having a seizure.  Other news items briefly covered included a Teen Mom star being choked by her mother,  Amy Fisher's stripping for Haiti, a Boston weatherman's on-air sexual innuendo, the Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien/David Letterman Tonight Show feud, John Edwards' paternity admission, and a movie review of "Choke."

The Conan O'Brien/Jay Leno controversy dominated a significant portion of the broadcast. Callers debated the fairness of Conan's treatment by NBC, contrasted with Leno's previous displacement. Jimmy Norton discussed the impact on his career.  The hosts and callers expressed strong opinions, often using strong language, and discussed differing levels of online fan activism.  The show broke into the news of Conan’s $45 million settlement from NBC, a significant portion going to his staff, discussing his final show and Leno’s return. Louis C.K.’s opinion that Conan's pursuit of the Tonight Show was misguided was also shared.

The discussion then took a bizarre turn with graphic details of Rich Voss’s dental implant procedures and the associated pain, including his unpleasant experience with Novocaine.  This transitioned into a discussion of Brock Lesnar's return to UFC after suffering from diverticulitis, including a doctor's call disputing Lesnar's claims of self-healing. A caller with Crohn's disease offered a possible explanation for Lesnar's recovery. The segment ended with discussion of a Saudi teen's harsh punishment for having a cell phone at school and plugs for Rich Voss's upcoming comedy shows.

The show later shifted to a heated, profane discussion about American foreign policy, focusing on the US's involvement in the Middle East and Haiti.  Rich Voss and the hosts engaged in a highly charged debate about American imperialism, resource exploitation, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The conversation touched on Obama's first year in office, environmental concerns, and a bomb scare that caused a plane from LaGuardia to make an emergency landing.

Studio guest Jeff Ross, along with Rich Voss, contributed to the discussion. Ross discussed his upcoming shows and book, shared a funny anecdote about a disastrous Comedy Central pilot, and provided commentary on several movies including *Avatar*, *Invictus*, *Crazy Heart*, and *Caddyshack*.  He also shared personal details, including a recent breakup.  The conversation included numerous comedic bits, like a story about an embarrassing movie theater experience and Voss's cigarettes and coffee being stolen by a drunk kid.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment featuring Jeff Ross where Opie jokingly mentioned past attempts to "kill" the husband of a female dancer he admired from "Dancing with the Stars." Ross then recounted a comedic bit with a piano player, revealing it was a setup.  He discussed upcoming stand-up performances,  including a "speed roast" segment.  The hosts and Ross shared dating anecdotes, and a show intern, Love Buzz, recounted being mugged at knifepoint.  Several interns were brought in for Ross to practice his speed roast, resulting in a series of crude jokes and personal insults based on their appearance and backgrounds.  Mars, a show engineer, was also included. The segment ended with promotions for Ross's shows and a Comedy Central taping called "Comics Anonymous," and further jokes aimed at the interns' physical attributes and sexual preferences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio, we've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw, sexual content is realistic, and just fucking people reacting with people is realistic. 
[00:00:30]  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God, give me spaces all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  And we're off.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks.  Hi.  How's everybody this morning?  A wonderful morning.  I'm effing tired for some reason.  Exhaustrated.  Just tired.  I like these little short weeks.  We get a Monday off, and all of a sudden it feels like a Wednesday, and it's a Thursday.  It's Thursday.  It's fantastical.  I guess the big news is everyone's going to get to see the first picture of Tiger Woods today. 
[00:01:30]  Is that it?  It finally surfaced.  I think we should do a bit called Ichiban.  I think I...  Oh.  What?  I'd say we should do a bit called Ichiban.  Ichiban.  Where that's the top story of the day.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  Ichiban.  Ichiban.  I think the picture was taken from space, though, is what I was trying to say.  Yeah, somebody...  It's very grainy, and it's very far away, but you got your first picture of Tiger Woods coming 
[00:02:00]  out of a sex rehab clinic in Mississippi, of all places, and he's got a beard.  Looks like a beard, and he's covering up pretty good.  He's got, like, a hood on, so they're calling him Tiger Hood.  All right.  Tiger Hood.  Let's all be honest.  It looks like a perp walk.  It looks like a perp walk to you?  It looks like a perp walk.  That looks like, you know, there's the guy.  We got to get him.  He removed a hat in an elevator or something.  He looks unlike the Tiger Woods we all know and love. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, he's got the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little...  I don't know if he looks like a perp.  He's got...  Come on.  He's got, like, freaking nice clothes on and sneakers.  He's just got a beard going on.  He's got a hoodie.  He's just walking around, yo.  Jesus.  I think...  I honestly think he looks...  He's holding a cup of coffee.  He looks like he's ready to throw it in someone's face.  Is he?  Yes.  He's ready to pull a knife on one of our interns, apparently. 
[00:03:00]  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  Good old Love Buzz got, I don't know, he got robbed outside the...  Allegedly mugged outside of our own building.  Two days ago.  Is he in today?  Is he here?  Two days ago.  All right, we'll talk to Love Buzz in a while.  Two days ago.  Oh, you should hear the story.  The way he tells it, it's fascinating.  I'd rather listen to some film about Obama being the presidential candidate.  Oh my God, I heard a replay of that for two seconds when I was leaving. 
[00:03:30]  I almost fell asleep driving.  Sorry.  That was really, really uninteresting.  I've got to be honest.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's be honest here.  Wow.  It was Ed Norton.  Edward Norton.  Edward Norton, yeah.  He likes us, though.  I like Edward Norton.  It's a weird situation.  I am one of his biggest fans.  I was asked yesterday, do you think he's a good actor?  Any movies you don't like him in? 
[00:04:00]  I mean, even his bad movies, I'm like, hey, at least he's good in them.  I had no problem with them.  Maybe he was a little groggy.  No, he's always done a bad phoner for us, to be honest with you.  Maybe he's always groggy.  That's why I said, hey, because he started asking about where we are.  I go, why don't you come in and see us?  Because I'm thinking, if we're going to have this relationship with Edward Norton, maybe  it should be a face-to-face.  Maybe, yeah, live.  Yeah, that wasn't helping either.  Danny kept popping up the pictures of him being raped in the shower in American History 
[00:04:30]  X while we were talking to him.  Yeah.  Which was more interesting to watch at least.  He's always been a little slow and a little boring on the phone, but yesterday took the  cake.  I don't know what was going on.  Was it L.A.?  Was he in L.A.?  I honestly don't know.  He was just kind of giving the facts of the documentary, but it was kind of hard to...  He never really got to the facts.  Very slow.  That was the problem.  Very slow and...  Plotting.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's tell you something. 
[00:05:00]  I'm a comic.  Phoners are hard, man.  I do.  I mean, like, I can't...  I'm horrible on phoners.  I really do hate them.  He just gave us the worst phoner ever.  That's true.  He really gave us the worst phoner ever.  That was a pretty, pretty slow-rolling phoner right there.  What are you going to do?  Ooh, look at his cheeks in the shower.  He's ready to get raped by the big Aryan guy.  He does have solid cheeks.  Oh, nice cheeks.  Everyone's going to be checking out that Tiger Woods picture. 
[00:05:30]  It's there.  Yeah.  They're apparently a sex addict.  He's at a rehab place in Mississippi.  That's bullshit.  And what's the place called?  I like the name of the place.  I don't...  Oh, Christ.  It was good.  It's...  Gentle Path.  Yes.  Gentle Path.  What does that mean?  What does that even mean?  You know what a Gentle Path is?  A vagina.  That is a gentle path.  Velvety, wet tunnel.  Yeah, let's call it that. 
[00:06:00]  If we have places called that, that would be great.  Gentle, I want to shove it in your gentle fucking path right now.  Dark starfish.  That's great.  He's been staying at the Gentle Path since late December.  Chose Mississippi because he thought it would be tougher for the media to find him.  Which it was.  It took a while.  Almost a month to find him.  How does that happen?  Elin demanded he enter rehab where she would divorce him.  Oh, fuck.  Divorce him anyway.  So he's going through all this shit for naught.  Tiger agreed even though he thinks he's okay. 
[00:06:30]  He is okay.  He just doesn't want to be married.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, he says he's okay but he did it for the marriage.  That's always good for rehab, right?  When you do it for someone else or an ultimatum.  Doesn't that work, Jim?  Usually not.  But my dad got sober because my mother was going to leave him.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's like sometimes I got sober to save a relationship I was in at the time.  I was like, I'm going to save this.  I was 18.  Really?  Yeah.  So usually you have to do it for yourself.  Did the guy appreciate it or was he insinuating on all sexuality? 
[00:07:00]  It was a girl.  Oh, literal Jim.  It was, you know, sometimes it sticks.  Like even when you don't go for the right reasons, it does stick.  Yeah?  Yeah, sometimes.  And that's probably what he was saying as he was entering the freaking facility.  He was paying hookers.  I disagree with you.  I think he is a sex addict.  You really think he's a sex addict?  Not in the excuse way.  Like, oh, he's a...  But like he was doing high risk things.  Like, it wasn't like he had a condom and he fucked a couple strippers here and there.  Like, you know, like any guy can understand it. 
[00:07:30]  That to me is being a guy.  He was a reckless, crazy...  Even for a single guy, he was fucking spending...  They said at least allegedly paying thousands of dollars to hookers.  Right.  Fucking without a rubber.  Fucking in his house.  And when it's interfering with every aspect of your life, personal and professional,  that's like the big sign, like, woo-hoo, time to...  But it didn't affect his life.  Huh?  It didn't affect his life.  No, it did behind the scenes, obviously.  Well, behind the scenes because he never wanted to be married.  But as far as his job goes, what? 
[00:08:00]  He was supposed to be better than he was?  He was a functional performer.  Like, as far as, like, you know...  Yeah, functional.  He was way more than functional.  He was the greatest golfer ever.  But...  And still winning like no one's business.  But his personal life was in shambles.  You knew it was in shambles.  You don't just one time go, oops, she caught me.  And back your escalate into shit.  And then you have her banging your windows out at golf.  It's a guy that never got to bang broads.  Yeah.  He was too busy hitting golf balls.  He thought he wanted to be married and realized probably very early on that he didn't want 
[00:08:30]  to be married.  It's like saying a man...  And then it was stuck and then there was an image thing and he said, fuck, I'll hang in  there.  I'll make believe I'm happily married and I'll do my thing on the side.  It's like saying Mickey Manor wasn't an alcoholic because he was hitting home runs.  Even though he was amazing at his job.  And this is not just about a guy getting laid a lot because then I think that's just a  guy being a guy.  But man, when you're spending thousands, and I mean thousands, of hush money and wiring  money to girls to keep them fucking quiet, that is hell on earth because you're so...  Every move you make is you're afraid the fucking house is going to collapse on you. 
[00:09:00]  That's a nightmare, dude.  All these whores.  Yeah.  Loud mouth whores.  Everyone knows who you are and where you are at all times.  Gotta keep them quiet.  But everywhere he goes, every fucking camera on the planet is on him.  Tiger Woods can't just go out and fuck at a bar.  Terrible.  I don't know.  I think he's going to sex rehab to just get everything back.  I think so, dude.  I don't think he's doing it.  I don't think he truly believes.  I don't think he's doing it because he thinks he's a sex addict.  Whether he is or not, I guess that's up to the people at Gentle Path and Tiger himself. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, that Gentle Path.  I don't know.  I mean, if you know anything about Tiger, this guy never was able to live his life and it  caught up with him.  That's all.  That's all.  You know, he should be banging broads for the next five or six years and then maybe  settle down with a new broad eventually.  Elin will spend a week with him in rehab, including Disclosure Day.  Oh, that's got to suck ass.  When Tiger will have to confess all his cheating to her.  Holy shit.  And they give him a week to do that? 
[00:10:00]  We don't have our new sweeper yet, do we?  The holy shit news of the day?  That's the holy shit news of the day.  That's holy shit.  Holy shit.  Could you imagine him sitting there face to face with his wife having to tell her every  sexual encounter he's had while they're married?  What?  How is that?  All right.  How is that constructive?  It's because it wipes the slate clean.  I'm guessing.  Really?  And she's going to be okay with that?  That's a gooey slate.  It smells like ammonia, like a peep booth. 
[00:10:30]  That's a gooey slate.  You think she's going to be all right with that, Jimmy?  I don't know, man.  I don't...  Again, I've never been to a sex rehab, so I don't know exactly how they work.  Yeah.  But there's obviously a reason for it.  It's almost like it's at a point of such critical mass, like just stop it.  Everything has to come out now because it's done anyway.  It's almost like she's going to leave anyway, so...  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't sound like he's into it either.  Last chance.  He's been basically telling a lot of these broads he was never...  Right?  I don't know the exact quotes, but he was basically saying he's in a loveless marriage. 
[00:11:00]  I think if he wasn't into it, at least saving...  For some reason, finance, kids, whatever, he wouldn't have gone to this.  Dude, he has no choice.  You think this is for a profession?  Yeah, he has no choice.  He has all...  Do you think this is to make himself look better?  He lost all his sponsors.  Yeah.  Just like we said, or some of us in this room said, he would lose everything.  Yeah.  Because Nike's coming out with their new line of golf clubs, and they don't have any Tiger  Woods mentioned anywhere.  Where he's lost everything. 
[00:11:30]  He's got to do this to save face, because, I mean, this country loves when someone apologizes,  and then they go, oh, okay, and then he gets everything back.  They love the redemption.  Right.  People like to feel like they're forgiving someone.  Right.  That's...  I mean, whether he learns something in the process, good for him, but he's not...  He's doing this to get everything back.  I heard Sirius hired him for $800 million to do a radio show, so he doesn't even need golf  anymore.  Hey, Michael Douglas went to one to save his marriage with Catherine J.  Catherine Jones.  Oh, really? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  She was going to dump him, because I think he cheated or whatever he did, and he went  through a sex rehab, and they have some, like, you know, deal signed or whatever.  But from what I've...  You know, obviously, if he cheated, it's not been out.  But, I mean, he's, I think, been a good boy since he was.  Now, it just goes to, like, jerking off constantly outside.  Yeah.  Just looking at a girl, jerk off.  Because how do you get over a sex addiction?  I mean, because it's something you still...  Again, it's like the people with food addictions.  They still have to eat. 
[00:12:30]  Now, drinking is one thing.  You could just stop it, and now I'm not...  I say I'm not drinking.  That's it.  But sex is...  You need fucking...  Fucking...  Well, you just find a healthy fucking...  Healthy boundaries.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know something?  Just like...  Sex is a weird thing.  No, well, food addicts are the same thing.  They still got to eat.  Think about it, though.  So they find healthy boundaries.  All right, healthy boundary.  But what if you're eating your food, and you just go, God, I want different food today.  Oh, I want different food tomorrow.  I want different food this afternoon. 
[00:13:00]  I want...  You know what I mean?  Like, you could be fucking your wife or whatever, and think...  Look, it's not easy.  I just want a different fucking piece of pussy.  It's not easy, obviously, but, you know, it's possible.  I'm not saying it's not possible, but it seems to be one of the worst, like, addiction things.  You just want to fuck everything that moves.  Yeah, I think you have to look at why you're doing things.  Like, last night.  Was that?  I couldn't sleep last night.  So I'm laying in bed, just jerking off for a little while.  It was like one in the morning, and I wasn't horny.  My dick wasn't even hard.  I was jerking off.  Why are you changing the subject to sexy story segments? 
[00:13:30]  I figured I'd get everybody a fucking little spongy in the underpants to start the day.  But I'm jagging off, and I'm like, I didn't come, and I'm like, I wasn't turned on.  It was almost like I was bored and frustrated I couldn't sleep.  It wasn't because, like, God, I'm horny, let me just jerk off, which to me is healthy.  What was Maude on?  It was the one where she's laying in therapy talking about Walter, and she looked at me,  and I had a weird moment.  God's going to get you for that, Jim.  Why don't you just jerk off to completion?  Because, I mean, it would have taken me a long time. 
[00:14:00]  When I'm tired and I can't fall asleep, that's exactly what I do.  It helps sometimes.  So why don't you just get it done?  Because I wasn't even horny.  I wasn't close to being horny.  Dude, as soon as you start messing with yourself, I...  Not the kid.  Really?  No, there are times where it's just like, you're, like, doing the helicopter rotation thing.  Not even hard, just going, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, just winding it up  like a rubber band propeller on a plane.  That's exactly what it is. 
[00:14:30]  Flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow.  I finish when I start, man.  Every single time.  You finish when you start.  You're a go-getter.  Oh, fucking yeah.  I don't...  I'm finishing this.  If I'm going to fuck it around a little bit, I gotta go all in.  All in?  Yes.  All in.  All in.  Yeah.  No, I don't always come, man.  Nah.  Sometimes you...  Sometimes just the thought of clean up and stuff, you're like, ah, it's too much of a hassle.  You have to piss after you.  I always get to pee after I come, so it's like, eh, I'll be up and down the toilet.  I don't know if you're coming or going. 
[00:15:00]  Shut up.  So Elon's going to be at Disclosure Day when Tiger will have to confess all his cheating.  I wonder if you have to confess just to her.  Or I imagine there's a counselor there, but is it the whole group, or is it just...  Hell fucking no.  Probably not.  I would guess hell fucking no.  Solo.  That's a solo with maybe...  Maybe you have the option of having a counselor in there.  I don't know.  Like he's got to sit with some fucking plumber from Trenton.  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Sitting there and Tiger's fucking telling every sex story he's had.  The plumber will choke him to death.  You had that life going? 
[00:15:30]  Fuck you.  Keep it to yourself.  Yeah, I'll bet it's just him and his wife and a counselor.  Yeah, yeah.  Tiger does not have to clean his own room or attend group counseling like everyone else.  Don't they do?  Yeah.  He has maid service and usually does one-on-one counseling.  Well, if you're in one of these facilities, don't you think you should once again go all  in and do what everyone else is doing?  I think you're supposed to.  It's part of the whole thing, isn't it?  Yes.  I don't like him having fucking maid service, if that's true.  But I'll say this.  There are weird exceptions to people in one-on-one service.  It's like he is one of many, but he is also an undeniably very, very famous guy. 
[00:16:00]  And sexual stuff, I think, is different than drugs or alcohol.  It's intensely private and personal, and it's also intensely sellable.  And you never know if someone tapes you.  There's a tremendous risk there.  There was somebody that went to some kind of therapy, and they had pictures of them making  the beds, and there was a whole big square.  Well, that happens to all of them.  Yeah, like one of these Hollywood guys.  All of them.  I don't know who the fuck it was.  Well, how about this next one?  He has spent $100,000 renovating the cabin he's staying in. 
[00:16:30]  Look, you can't do that.  This is fake rehab.  You've got to stay in the shithole they give you.  You have to stay in the shithole and deal with the fucking assholes that are there with  you.  You've got to clean your own fucking room, do your own laundry.  I'm Tiger Woods, and I'm a sexist.  You're Tiger!  Tiger!  You've got to have the guys in there.  Boy, I'm sure the rest of the people staying there aren't pissed off as he's renovating  one of the cabins for $100,000. 
[00:17:00]  As he's walking to some therapy thing, some guy's going, Tiger, look at me.  Here's my swing, and I have a problem.  I'm always fucking shanking it.  Exactly.  All right, look.  I'm here for a reason.  Could you shut up?  This is all just to get his image back.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of people depend on Tiger Woods to make a nice living.  $100,000 to fix the cabins.  Other patients are upset that their trips to the YMCA for exercise have been canceling  so reporters can't ask them questions.  Wow.  Source says Tiger is mentally exhausted and tired of saying he's a sex addict. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  He's right back to fucking.  Right back to fucking.  Unless something clicks.  Yeah, probably.  I mean, who knows?  He's got to deal with his daddy issues.  I don't like that scumbag.  I understand the Enquirer's a job to do, but anything with rehab or recovery, I just,  I, the fucking, whoever took that photo, I hope they step into a fucking ditch and their  foot is snapped off.  I don't know if that's a realistic punishment. 
[00:18:00]  I'm trying to think if that's even possible.  Probably not.  I just, there's a thing about rehab that you should just kind of leave people alone.  Yeah.  Let them deal with their demons.  Fucking vulture scumbag.  Deal with their demons.  Unless you're Dr. Drew and then you put it on TV for everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, at least it's voluntary, you know.  I don't, I'm not a fan of Dr. Drew anymore.  I can't figure out if he's exploiting those people.  I don't, I would love to talk to him about it and not beat him up and go, Dr. Drew, don't  you think you're exploiting these people?  They had, uh, what's the country singer that was banging Roger Clemens, allegedly? 
[00:18:30]  Mindy, uh, what was her name?  Oh.  McCready?  Yeah.  They had Mindy McCready on, did you guys see this?  No.  Celebrity rehab where she had a seizure and they filmed the whole fucking thing?  No way.  And they showed it?  Oh yeah.  Mackenzie Phillips and, uh, Mindy, uh, McCready, I guess.  They're in their room.  And, uh, McCready's talking about Dr. Drew.  Like, yeah, Dr. Drew wanted me to tell him, I don't know, the last time I drank or something.  So she's talking to her roommate, Mackenzie Phillips, right? 
[00:19:00]  And all of a sudden she starts shaking as she's telling this story how Dr. Drew needed  this info.  But Mackenzie Phillips starts laughing her ass off thinking McCready is fucking doing some  kind of bit.  Wow.  Then she falls on the floor and now she's in full seizure and she, her hands are like,  ah, she's losing her fucking mind.  And then Mackenzie Phillips finally wakes the fuck up and goes, holy shit.  Maybe there's a problem.  And runs out and gets help.  And that's where they left the episode.  I don't, when's the new one? 
[00:19:30]  Did I, I don't think I, uh.  No, it hasn't been a new one.  Okay, good.  Yeah, that's how they left us.  Her being, you know, thrown into a fucking, uh, ambulance.  A bambulance.  I need the bambulance.  So I don't know what's, I don't know what's up with this Dr. Drew.  I don't know.  Is he helping people by having this TV show?  Is he exploiting these people?  Oh, here's the clip.  Oh, cool.  Oh, there she goes.  Look at her.  She's laughing her ass off.  She's dead. 
[00:20:00]  Oh my God, she's seizing up.  The camera crew's helping her.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  The camera crew's zooming in and.  Yeah.  This is so exploitive.  No one's touching her.  Because they've got to get the good shot.  That cameraman should be dropping his fucking camera and doing something.  And then of course.  And then it says to be continued in the middle of her season. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  It's the most exploitive.  These reality shows, I can't even fucking watch them.  I really can't.  There's only a couple I could watch.  I like, I like the little, little miss fucking.  It's not exploiting.  Why?  It is not.  See, they're, the parents are exploiting the kids anyway.  They're just filming it.  It's just whatever happens, it's happening.  These people are making their own reality.  Right.  So.  Well, the celebrity rehab's a terrific show, but I'm not watching to learn anything. 
[00:21:00]  I'm watching so I could see someone have a seizure and all that crap.  I don't give a shit about these people's lives.  Dr. Drew is completely exploiting.  I think, I think more, I think, I think so.  How he deals with it in his own head and how he sleeps at night might be another story,  but it's exploitation.  I think so.  He gets washed up stars that are kind of desperate for a little more fame,  so they go on these shows with these horrendous problems.  Look at us.  Do you think we're helping Bobo? 
[00:21:30]  I don't fucking know, but we're not sitting.  It's completely exploitive.  Of course.  We're exploiting him for his retardation.  But we, I don't know, but his life has.  But he has fun.  His life has some kind of weird purpose because of.  Of that?  Because of his time on our show, so I don't know.  New celebrity rehab tonight.  Oh, great.  And in other reality news, I guess we could go with this one.  Brian in East Orange, thank you.  Good stuff here.  Teen Mom star.  Remember the stuck up girl that always.  Oh, what was that? 
[00:22:00]  That's always leaving the baby at home to go out on dates.  That's...  Yeah?  She was choked out by her mother.  It's a big story.  Nice.  Mother was arrested and everything.  It's the show you like.  Which one is that?  I'm 17 and pregnant or whatever the fuck it's called.  Oh, holy crap.  Which one?  Oh, the chick that likes going out?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's kind of hot.  She wants to go out.  So what?  Leave the kid at home.  Leave it with the parents.  Although she did go over someone's house on some kind of a... 
[00:22:30]  Not a blind date thing, but it was like, let me go out with my friends.  We'll meet up with these guys at some house.  And I was not happy with the people that she had met up with.  Right.  With her being, you know, of one section of society and her...  Well, I wasn't even going to bring that up.  And that guy being of another section of another section of another section.  Why do you sugarcoat it?  Jesus Christ.  Keep my job.  Just stop at the sugarcoating.  I wasn't going to say that.  I gotta sugarcoat everything I say. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God.  Without the sugar, people will see what a horrific racist I am.  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  People want to talk about Tiger a little bit, the sex rehab thing.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, good morning, Obi, Anthony.  Jimmy, I have a question for you.  I assume that sex rehab follows the same 12 steps as other recovery programs.  Don't you think it's a little harmful to go immediately to that ninth step so quick  without at least having an understanding of the first eight? 
[00:23:30]  Maybe.  I don't know exactly what the sex rehab...  Don't forget, the sex rehabs are separate from 12-step programs.  They incorporate the 12 steps, but they're not a part of the 12-step program.  I think in regular rehab, you do that, too, though, where you bring family in, and you'll  confess stuff to your family and talk to your family.  What are you saying?  Like, that soon?  No, no, no.  Well, that's why I want to jump in.  How many days do you stay at a sex rehab?  I'm guessing it varies.  It could be 30, 60, 90.  I don't know.  Well, he's probably close to 30 days in, though, Brian. 
[00:24:00]  Brian's talking about making amends.  Is that after you leave a rehab?  Well, it's usually not based on rehab.  It's usually based on just your personal getting better.  Okay.  And it's about, you know, in one of the particular steps, you make a list of all the people you  hurt, and in another one, you make amends to them wherever possible, unless it would  hurt them or other people.  But maybe this one is...  I don't know if this is considered making amends, dude.  Maybe this is just about confessing.  Maybe this is not about...  Maybe this just kind of cleans the slate so any of the steps can be done.  I really don't know.  I haven't been through it.  Yeah, Brian, it doesn't sound like it's amends. 
[00:24:30]  It sounds more like, yeah, just getting it all out there.  Yeah.  Just like we said, cleaning the slate and confessing all the bullshit.  Do you think he's jerking off like at night?  Of course he is.  Because he's alone in the room, but that's got to be part of it, too.  You can't just be spanking it every night, because that's part of being a sex addict,  too.  No, you've got to get rid of the poison.  What, is he supposed to get a penis pump to suck out the poison?  Well, that's just it.  If you don't jerk it, the second they let you out of that place, you are going to be  like, ooh, do you need to fuck? 
[00:25:00]  Well, you've got one of those amazing sex dreams.  Yeah, maybe a wet dream or something.  Clean up the sheets.  Let's go to Nick in Ohio.  Nick?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  I disagree a little with you guys about the Tiger thing.  I think he's going to have to deal with this addiction once he's out of the rehab on his  level.  So what's wrong?  He ain't going to be making his own bed once he gets out of rehab.  So why should he be making his own bed now? 
[00:25:30]  It has nothing that's making his own bed has nothing to do with his addiction and having  a nice place to live.  So why should he have to live like a pioneer?  I disagree.  Here's why I disagree with you.  You're technically making the bed doesn't.  But there are times where you have to learn just to do as other people do.  And it's about being humbled and a certain amount of humility and not thinking that my  way is the best way.  And it's like everybody else in this particular situation is making their bed that I should 
[00:26:00]  get up off my lazy fucking ass and make my bed because that same sense of I don't  have to do it the way they do it is probably the thing that got him in trouble to begin  with.  I don't have to do it the way other people do it because I am who I am.  Good point, Jim.  Good point.  So rehab now becomes a punishment.  It's not a punishment, dude.  It's teaching somebody something.  It's not punishment.  It's voluntary.  Well, it's certainly a punishment if you have to do something like as demeaning as making  his own bed if he's a billionaire and then he's going to look back on this rehab as,  wow, the rehab part of my life sucked and I had to make my own bed and now I'm a billionaire 
[00:26:30]  again so I don't have to make my own bed and the sex addiction part of my life was great  so let me go back to that.  Well, I'm glad you think that making your own bed is some form of like fucking Saddam  Hussein beating your feet with a fucking two by four.  I think it's a lot like, dude, think about it.  If you go into the Marine Corps, they make you do a lot of things that you're not going  to do when you're out of the Corps, but they have a reason for making you do it.  And I think the sex... 
[00:27:00]  Tearing down.  Yeah, exactly.  Tearing down.  Here you are.  You're not Tiger Woods fucking rich golf pro.  You are another guy that's in here with a problem and you're going to act just like everybody  else, which means make the bed, clean the toilets, do whatever.  Just because you're getting out and going back to your other life doesn't mean that that breaking  down period has any less value.  Well, those are good points, but...  Of course they are!  I set them into a microphone. 
[00:27:30]  All right, Nick.  Nick Bell.  Now this guy acted like there was fingernails being pulled out.  I know.  Making a bed?  There goes a billionaire and I'm making a bed life.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John?  Yeah, I want to hear a bit when Tiger is in bed in rehab and he wakes up for the first  time and he realizes that he's in rehab.  You know, maybe if we would have thought of that before you call up and said it, because  now it's all set up and it's silly. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  Maybe later or tomorrow after we forget this.  Tiger is fine.  We forget this call.  I don't feel bad for him.  There's a lot of people who are alkeys and drug addicts who wake up in jail and never  remember what they did and they drunk drove into somebody or they fucking murdered a guy  in a bar fight and they have no memory of it and the rest of their life is finished.  Oh, does that suck?  It happened to you?  Oh, I don't know.  Don't confess.  No one's caught me yet.  I mean, I wouldn't black out, so I never woke up with a victim and a load on me going, 
[00:28:30]  what happened?  That's one thing about sex addiction.  You were awake during the whole thing.  Yes, I was.  Uh, let's go to Boris in New York.  Boris.  Boris.  I hope that's not what he does.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Oh, it's...  Tell us about your movie about the president.  Hi, Boris.  What's going on, guys?  This is B-Golf from Twitter.  I recognize him.  Oh, damn, yo.  This guy's fucking working on my goddamn swing.  Really?  Yes, he is.  You know, it don't mean a thing. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Boris, what do you got?  Boris knows a little something about golf.  What do you got?  Well, the only thing I'm disappointed about Tiger going to sex rehab now, since he's not  going to win any more majors.  It just seemed like when he had all these hookers, he was winning all these tournaments.  Now, without him going, you know, now with all the sex rehab, no more golf tournaments,  no more.  He's making money on the bets that I'm making on him.  He's probably going to shank every other shot, because he can't calm his nerves anymore.  Can you imagine any tournament in New York, him coming there? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, my God.  No wonder he was mellow all the time.  He was getting rid of fucking poison every other hour, it looks like.  God, you know how much pressure the golf swing is there, Hope.  Imagine now.  Now you can't get any hookers when you leave a certain tournament.  It's going to be all stiff.  It's going to be all stiff.  He was nice and loose.  Everything loosey-goosey.  Not just in the cock.  He's going to be stiff everywhere.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hey, Boris, what do you think, though?  I mean, he's obviously trying to get all this done so he could get ready for, I would say, 
[00:30:00]  the Masters, right?  Yeah, I would think the Masters, if he can get, or before the Masters, I think there's  another tournament, I think Arnold's on Bay Hill, or I think that tournament beforehand.  He's won there a lot, so he might use that as a tune-up for the Masters.  There's no way, there's no way this Tiger Woods sits out this golf season.  There's no way.  Really?  Full of statement?  This guy wants back by the Masters at the very least.  When's the Masters?  April.  Mid-April, right? 
[00:30:30]  Absolutely, yeah.  You think he came on that green jacket?  You think he fucked on it and just came on it?  Probably some hooker was wearing it after they had sex.  Oh, this is the guy!  What does it even mean?  Oh, my God!  It's an ugly color!  Shut up!  Eat this!  All right, boys.  You guys have a good show.  Thank you, Boris.  Go.  Because there's no way he...  Nah, he's too close to all these records and stuff.  He needs all the time he could get on the golf course.  Oh, is he going to get some shit, though? 
[00:31:00]  Well, he's doing the rehab and then...  Oh, it don't matter.  That crowd is not going to be fucking kind when he's stepping up to the golfers.  What do they do if you yell at the golfers?  There's nothing they could really do.  Will they throw you out if you're yelling?  Well, sure, but if they can find you, first of all.  Second of all, I mean, there's going to be a lot of them.  The thing is...  It's going to be a crowd mentality problem.  It's not going to be one or two hecklers here and there.  They could handle that, sure.  And when he steps up to the tee to swing, that, you know, I think people can be quiet during that time.  And not be assholes. 
[00:31:30]  But as he's walking up and waiting to tee off, there's going to be people fucking...  Hey, hey, hey, tiger!  You piece of pussy!  Hey, you love the piece of pussy!  And they hold up the quiet signs and he's got to swing?  Come on!  I told you the story with Phil Mickelson, and it was a simple one.  It was his birthday during the U.S. Open.  They sang happy birthday the entire fucking time he walked around the course.  That's good.  So, you know, they're animals.  You better hope I'm not near to the tiger.  I'll start screaming stuff at him. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah?  Like what?  Hey!  You better be careful you don't start knocking shots in the woods or something.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Bud!  Hey, guys.  We took my son to Narcotics Anonymous, and the whole point about, you know, confessing  is a little bit, it adds a little bit of shame so that you realize what you're doing to the  people around you.  So I would think that that would be in a group. 
[00:32:30]  But the whole thing about making your bed is about taking responsibility for your actions.  It has nothing to do with punishment or, you know, breaking you down.  It's just, it's a part of, you know, you're responsible for what you do and how you hurt  people.  And by, you know, making you do things, make your bed, you know, clean your bathroom, it's  take responsibility.  Well, and I also think it's about everybody else is doing that type of stuff. 
[00:33:00]  He should do that type of stuff.  I don't think you should get any special treatment in a rehab.  Again, he's a weird case to talk publicly in groups about certain aspects of it because,  again, it is a sellable story.  And it's a different thing when you're arguably the biggest story in the country.  Look, somebody bragged that he was there.  Somebody blabbed.  That's how they know.  So somebody would talk.  Yeah, of course.  I understand that.  But again, you know, I don't think you should be getting any kind of special treatment.  I agree.  You should live in a nasty hut like everyone. 
[00:33:30]  It's just, you've got to take responsibility.  It sounds like he's not doing that.  And isn't it, and you surrender, right, Jimmy?  You kind of surrender.  So isn't part of surrendering like, okay, I'm going to be here under these conditions  doing what they tell me, right?  I agree.  The only renovations I would find acceptable are things for privacy because, again, there  is people of a tremendous interest.  Maybe your own pillow or something.  $100,000 of privacy stuff.  No, no, that's what I'm saying.  It's not.  It's not.  It's like that's the only stuff.  It would be stuff like, you know, thick drapes or whatever to keep people who are seeing in. 
[00:34:00]  I'm sure they give you, yeah, a couple things here and there, but like Ann said, $100,000  in renovations is a little crazy.  He wants the luxury.  I think that's the rehab, personally allowing him to do it because they know it's going to  get out that he stayed there.  And I think that making him happy is important to them because then it will get out that  he stayed there.  Like Betty Ford, everybody knows he's a great rehab, you know, I think in California for  alcohol.  Sure.  And then he's probably not going to come back with him, so they'll have that Tiger Woods suite.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They'll have that Tiger Woods suite.  Thanks, guys.  Nice.  No one will ever stay in that cabin again. 
[00:34:30]  It'll just be a museum or something.  Yeah.  Oh, they'll sell it to high-profile celebrities.  They'll probably just circle all the loads he...  Yeah, on the carpet.  On the carpet.  Tiger's loads.  I posted a picture on my Twitter and someone just wrote, he looks like Denzel Washington,  the book of Eli.  Oh, nice.  The new movie coming out with Denzel Washington.  We'll see that.  Denzel would be in town.  Should I try to get him?  Yes.  Should I...  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Give it a whirl. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, you know what?  All right, let's go to Darren and PA.  Darren!  Yeah?  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, Phil Mickelson, you've got to hire a chick to just flash her tits every time he comes up to the game.  He's got that weakness now.  Mickelson knows it, so all he's got to do is play it.  You know it's going to be Golden Palace.  They'll get some naked broad with the logo across their boobs.  Yeah, Phil.  Hey, who's the pervert to get to stay in his cabin after he's gone?  Yeah, we were just saying that.  I bet you they close it up. 
[00:35:30]  They don't use it ever again.  Wow, that's pretty close.  The Book of Eli and Tiger.  Very, very good observation.  How about the Tiger Suite?  Thank you, Darren.  No problem.  Very good.  I wasn't going to say that.  Oh, the biggest problem is going to be Tiger's caddy.  Tiger's caddy is an animal.  Yeah, winning that caddy tournament.  That's important.  Steve Williams, I think his name is.  He's beat up fans before, thrown them down the hill, thrown their cameras in the water.  Okay, so he's going to be a protector.  So he's going to have, I think he's going to have a tough time controlling himself when Tiger finally gets back on that golf course. 
[00:36:00]  Let's say hi to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, man.  So, listen, isn't there a statistic that says that, like, men think of sex every six or seven seconds?  Yeah, it's silly.  Just don't buy the whole sex addiction.  It seems to me, like, I don't know, like, Jimmy's thought on, I don't know if it's a sex addiction as much as it is an addiction to his celebrity and power. 
[00:36:30]  That he could do whatever.  Just liking it, right?  With it.  Yeah.  He could get away with whatever he wanted.  I think it all depends.  I think it all depends, honestly, dude.  I mean, for him, the opportunities are more and the chicks are hotter.  But that's like saying because he does a lot better coke, is he more or less of a coke addict than a guy that has to blow other guys for fucking crack money?  Rich Voss.  Oh, he'll be coming in.  But you know what I'm saying?  But aren't all guys sex addicts?  No.  All guys are very...  To some extent, what are the sex addicts? 
[00:37:00]  I'm explaining to you, sir.  All guys are not sex addicts.  All guys have a much higher sex drive or think about it more.  But when you're spending thousands of dollars in hush money and you're taking the risks, it all depends on what risks you're taking, too.  It's like, if I'm willing to sacrifice, look what he has sacrificed just to get laid.  Look what he has sacrificed.  He has hundreds of millions of dollars.  His family is humiliated.  His wife is humiliated.  His image is destroyed.  Look at all he sacrificed just to get loads off behind his wife's back. 
[00:37:30]  And don't forget, you know, he has been spending all this time honing his golf skills.  Yeah.  I bet you he hasn't hit many golf balls in that.  Well, you keep talking because it's the Brian Show from fucking North Carolina.  Go ahead, Brian.  We're in your world.  I appreciate it.  Brian, all guys are not.  Why make a fucking point?  Listen, doesn't that just mean he makes poor decisions?  It doesn't mean he's addicted to sex.  Do you not see the difference between. 
[00:38:00]  He would never take a higher level of risk.  Do you not see the difference.  Okay, so I guess it means if you drink and drive and you run into somebody with your car when you're drunk, you're not an alcoholic.  You just make poor decisions.  There's a balance there.  Where does the he just makes poor decisions ends and he's a complete sex addict take over.  And I'm not making excuses for the guy.  I think he's an addict because he risked too much.  He did way too much risky shit.  Why is he fucking without a condom as a billionaire?  Me? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, sorry.  I thought you were bringing me into this whole thing.  Do you know what I'm saying?  He's a married guy with kids.  And a couple of the girls said he fucked without condoms.  That is insanity.  Yeah, I've never said he's the brainiest guy in the world.  He's not stupid, dude.  He knows the risk.  He's taking the risk.  Yeah, but does that mean he's actually not an addiction or he cannot control himself?  I think so, yeah.  Is it just, he's Tiger Woods.  I'll do what I want.  I've got the money. 
[00:39:00]  I've got the money.  I've got the power.  I think so, yeah.  But I think he'd still be the same guy.  If he had the opportunities and he had no money, I still think he'd do the same thing.  I was broke when I was drinking, dude.  I never had money when I drank.  I was drinking a case of warm Meisterbrow for $8.  We would buy grain alcohol because it got you drunk faster.  I never had money.  But, Jimmy, alcohol is a proven, like, disease.  There's proven, like, physiological impacts to your body from being an alcoholic. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  What are the physiological impacts of being a sex addict?  It doesn't have the same withdrawal, I'm sure.  But I think the things that go into making people addicts and alcoholics, the personality defects, the personality disorders, the load, whatever it is that makes, like, they say alcohol and drugs are a symptom of the disease.  So it's like maybe the acting out sexually is a symptom of the underlying problem.  That's personally what I think.  I could buy that.  Yeah.  We'll buy it.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  All right, brother.  So let's go to Chris in New Jersey. 
[00:40:00]  Chris.  Hey, fellas.  What's up?  What up, Chris?  Hey, fella.  Hey, I just want to chime in.  I kind of picked up the conversation only about 10 minutes ago.  But I recently was in a drug and alcohol rehab, and Jimmy's 100% right.  I mean, it's all about humility.  You know, they come in, they check your bed, that you're making your bed, that you're keeping your room clean, that you're doing your dishes.  You know, and fuck, I don't do any of that shit at home. 
[00:40:30]  But it's all about being humble and making these little changes in your life that, you know, are going to hopefully set you on the right path and complying with what the rules are.  Because, you know, most of the people are so fucking out of control when they get there that they can't even, like, make a fucking bus schedule, much less take care of their own lives.  You're right, too.  It's about following a set of rules. 
[00:41:00]  And it's like, you know, we don't, people are like, well, we shouldn't have to follow rules.  Well, we don't have to.  The option is to go back to doing what I was doing.  That choice is mine.  And the same is with him.  Yeah.  But if he's not making his own bed in a rehab, then, you know, as far as I'm concerned, he's not doing anything.  Like, if you can't make your own bed in a rehab because you've got money, that's just silly.  And the rehab is dumb for allowing that.  Right.  In the rehab I went through, there had been in the past a couple of NFL football players.  And they think of certain perks.  Like, you know, usually it was four guys to an apartment. 
[00:41:30]  You know, he got his own apartment.  You know, he had the, he was able, he was allowed to bring in his TV and his, you know, his PlayStation and all that shit.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I don't like that at all.  What's he, what's he going to do?  What, what, what he drinks?  Is his fucking, does the booze affect his liver differently than everybody else there?  Or, or, uh, what he, what he does drugs, is he less likely to go out and fucking buy more at three o'clock in the morning?  I don't like that at all.  The rehabs suck if they allow that.  Rehabs are shit if they allow that. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I mean, when I heard that, I was a little surprised myself, especially since, you know, they were pretty disciplinary, uh, you know, they were pretty strict with everybody.  But, yeah, at the same time, the guy, the one, the one guy that was there most recently, he was there for a bunch of months.  It wasn't like he was 28 days in and out.  I mean, so I guess over time, they kind of allow, you know, a little more trust, a little more rope. 
[00:42:30]  But, I mean, you know, and meanwhile, it is a business, too.  I mean, you got to figure the guy's paying cash out of pocket.  Well, I, I think it's like picking a college.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So, all these rehab places want a Tiger Woods.  It's good for their business, like you just said, Chris.  So, unfortunately, they're going to allow some of these perks, uh, knowing that they get to say Tiger Woods was at our facility.  So, it's kind of, but Tiger Woods should be realizing that somewhere deep in his soul.  Like, if I'm going to do this, I should do it the right way. 
[00:43:00]  Absolutely.  Right, I mean, you're right on, because there was, while I was there, there was a guy who was the son of a big-time football agent, a player agent, who was only there because a couple of his clients had gone through the program, too.  This guy paid 90 grand cash, like just wrote a check for the time he was there.  I mean, the rehab bent over backwards for that.  I would love to know what that guy's doing now. 
[00:43:30]  I wonder if it helped him.  Yep.  Well, I hope so.  I mean, you know, you do, I mean, my program was completely AA-based, so, you know, you have to hope everybody gets the concept of the program.  Well, I hate anybody who thinks that they're different, like, not you, of course, but I mean, like, celebrities.  The only leeway, like I said, I give any celebrities is certain privacy issues where certain things that they're discussing, it's unfortunate, but other people will go out and report that because there's money involved or it's interesting to the public at large. 
[00:44:00]  But as far as the rules and what helps people recover, I fuck celebrities, man.  They shouldn't do one thing differently as far as that's concerned.  I'm with you.  They're not different.  I'm with you on that.  They're not special.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chris.  I want to give...  Good luck, Ben.  I want to give a lot of people that want in on this.  Wood Floor Liquor.  Let's get some people in on this.  My name is Wood Floor Liquor.  I'm an alcoholic.  Hi, Wood Floor Liquor.  He's quite famous on Twitter, this Wood Floor Liquor. 
[00:44:30]  I'll tell you that much.  What do you got, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Addiction is a thing that's near and dear to my heart, having a lot of it in my family, but I'm pretty sure, not to put Dr. Steve in a pinch, but I'm pretty sure that they said on Weird Medicine recently  that the Journal of Medicine is actually considering taking sexual addiction off the books as a legitimate medical excuse for doing things.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, we don't have any info on that, unfortunately.  Yeah, I don't know what to say about that.  Yeah.  I don't think it's an excuse, though. 
[00:45:00]  I don't think you shouldn't suffer penalties for doing things because you're a sex addict.  You have to suffer the penalties of them.  Well, I think that it's just that there's underlying things that are causing you to do it, not necessarily that you're addicted.  It's not addictive sex, but maybe that you have an addictive personality and other things are causing you to do these things and act out the way that you're acting out.  Here's the deal.  Tiger's married and he's got a couple of kids or whatever, whatever the fuck ever.  Uh, what if he wasn't?  Would this be like, oh, my God, he's a sex addict and needs help? 
[00:45:30]  Uh, he's playing the game.  He's playing the game fine.  He would just be one of these guys like Warren Beatty who would be like, all right, he's just the guy that's out there fucking every chick.  I would love to know A-Rod's track record.  Yeah.  He's a single guy.  Yeah, exactly.  I bet you there's, uh, some similarities between Tiger Woods and A-Rod.  He's an addict because he's married.  None of these guys, you never see anyone enter sex addiction clinics unless they're fucking married. 
[00:46:00]  Uh, it just doesn't happen.  Look what happened.  Fucking, uh, Duchovny did it.  Like you said, Michael Douglas did it because they're married.  Was Spitzer a sex addict?  I, again, I think.  Did he go to sex rehab?  I don't know what he did, but I think if you're the governor of a state and you are somehow filtering money to hookers and fucking without a rubber, I think that's the sign of an addict.  A hero?  Oh, an addict.  No, please.  Sorry.  And don't forget, it's always like nobody gets sober.  Like, personally, I didn't quit drinking and doing drugs because you never walk in when things are great. 
[00:46:30]  It's always when things are awful.  So if you're married, then all of a sudden the bottom is fucking probably a lot faster because you're losing somebody.  Is it faster or is there just a bottom there?  And then there's no fucking bottom when you're a single guy as far as sex goes.  I don't think you could lump it all into one category of addiction.  Alcohol, this.  Alcohol's a lot different.  It could fuck you up physically.  I think a sex addiction is more fuck up your lifestyle.  Mentally, there's a problem. 
[00:47:00]  I don't see it like, you know, you can't crash into a child while you're fucking someone in the ass.  And, you know, ruin your life that way.  I disagree.  I think they are the same.  You're right.  You can't do that.  But it is progressive and you do things that you said you'd never do.  Like, I know that, like, again, I love to get laid.  I've never been married.  And I know I'm an addict.  It's like normal people don't do what I do.  Normal people don't jerk off online.  I mean, I mean, like, way beyond what is considered healthy.  The fucking risks I've taken of getting arrested, getting prostitutes. 
[00:47:30]  If you knew the hours spent ritualistically cruising prostitutes.  Especially when we were off the air.  Dude, I would listen to Joe Benningo every night.  And it went way beyond, hey, he's a horny guy.  It was my escape.  And I would start going to the comedy cellar a lot of times.  I'd start 2 or 3 in the morning, 1 o'clock in the morning, be done at 5.30 in the morning.  Wouldn't even get a hooker because it was a high.  It was about keeping a high going.  And jerking off while I'm driving.  Absolute lunacy. 
[00:48:00]  Completely out of control.  That's something you do.  That's a crazy thing you do maybe when you're, like, 18.  Just to try it.  I think I'm going to jerk off driving.  It was absolute insanity.  And then Craigslist became available.  And the hookers kind of stopped.  So it just changed.  But I didn't have the penalty of losing my wife.  And you know what?  As a comedian, if I got arrested with a hooker, it would not ruin my career.  It really wouldn't.  It would almost help it.  It would, you know, in a way, yeah.  There have been comics that have been caught with trannies and shit like that. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm not saying that.  No, no, no.  I know what you mean.  It couldn't have happened, but.  Yeah.  Wow.  We hit something today.  Let's go to Jake in Jersey.  This is all based, I guess we got a lot of people tuning in for the first time.  The first picture of Tiger Woods has surfaced from a sex rehab clinic in Mississippi.  Mississippi, sorry.  And he's got a beard and a hoodie on.  And then, you know, he looks like an evil tiger now, just like we were saying on this  fine show.  Jake, what do you got? 
[00:49:00]  Hey, good morning, boy.  Good morning, Jake.  Hey, my daughter, unfortunately, has been in one of these kind of rehabs now for six  months.  Daughter?  I think it sucks.  It really does.  She has had an NBA star in there.  And they bring the people.  I'm so sorry.  They bring the people who drink and the people who are doing drugs together with the people  who are doing sex.  So now my daughter is not only addicted to drugs, but she loves sex. 
[00:49:30]  And it's like a reverse whorehouse.  They bring everybody together into one place and fuck them at once.  So, wow.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what to say about that.  Sounds like a great rehab.  Where is this?  Yeah, exactly.  But Jimmy's right.  It's all about humility.  It's all about tearing people down and putting them back into a sense of them having a sense  of themselves.  Why are they on this planet? 
[00:50:00]  Not just to do drugs and have fun and get high, but what's your purpose?  And a lot of them don't have one.  Yeah.  NBA star.  You lost me right there.  Yeah, hopefully it was Jeff Hornacek or John Stockton.  So, anyway, boys, have a good day.  Have a good show.  Take care, man.  I'm going to completely disagree with this guy right here.  Tony in Virginia.  Tony.  Morning.  How are you?  Hey, Tony.  My point is, his wife would have been taking care of every little need that he has. 
[00:50:30]  And servicing him properly, he wouldn't have gone straight and wandered around.  That's such a...  That is so ridiculous.  That is true.  Let me say this.  I think the guy was pressured into getting married because of his image.  And, you know, he wasn't ready to be married.  Simple as that.  Whether he's a sex addict or not, I don't know.  But it's pretty obvious that the guy never really wanted to be married.  I mean, I split up with my wife because she wasn't taking care of my niece. 
[00:51:00]  I found something that is.  I'm not wandering around looking for a book of strangers.  I have what I have that's good.  Well, maybe you're not an addict.  No.  Well, I don't know if I am or not, but everybody likes sex.  But I'm saying, if my wife were to take care of things, I wouldn't trade.  I think it's important.  If my wife were to take care of things, she wouldn't trade.  That's not true at all.  I think it's important to have a healthy sex life at home, obviously.  But we're talking about two different things here.  Yeah.  And this guy wasn't ready to be married.  I mean, that is the obvious thing here. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Well, that's what I'm talking about now.  He was having sex with, like, hookers and stuff while his wife was giving birth.  And, I mean, half these stories are true.  The guy wasn't ready.  It's not about the partner not taking care of you, I don't think.  Because I've had girls that were a little prudish and that weren't great.  And I've had girls that would literally do anything I wanted in bed, and it didn't matter.  I held out on them a little longer.  I'm actually good now, believe it or not.  I mean, my track record is fairly abysmal. 
[00:52:00]  But after things came crashing down for me at one point, really bad it got.  I can't say I got sexually sober, quote-unquote.  But it knocked out a tremendous amount of my shitty behavior because there were real consequences.  Well, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the State Theater.  Thank you very much, buddy.  The second show is on sale tomorrow.  Bye.  Yes.  All right.  Be good.  Bye, guys.  And if you go to sex rehab, how hard is it not to have sex with other people at the sex rehab?  Because they all just want it.  Do you think they have people just march in the halls, guarding all the rooms? 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  How do you not?  Knowing the person across the hall is just as bad as you.  I know.  And completely understands.  I know.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because with the alcohol and stuff, they're always checking you.  So, I mean, you could smuggle alcohol into a rehab center, certainly.  Got to bring your cock and your pussy in there.  But you got your cock and pussy out at all times.  They can't take that off your person.  How do you not?  I guess there's a certain transparency.  I'm guessing that they can see into your room at all times.  They probably have no room entering policies for opposites. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  Yeah?  I just don't know.  They have to be so strict.  But you can't stop it.  It's almost like two guys can be gay.  So you can't just say no men with women because then two guys will blow you.  It's like, I don't know.  I guess you have to leave it up to the individuals to a certain degree, too.  It's like, you're here.  I would love to know because I don't even know how you have a roommate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two monkeys.  Just throwing cum on each other.  Fucking.  Oh, jeez.  Turn my little ringer off.  It's not gay because I'm an addict.  You know, I'm just.  Absolutely.  We're just getting high here.  Right. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Just.  That is a fuck.  That's a question I need answered.  Uh.  The addiction is about the power you get as a millionaire.  Uh.  Oh, yeah.  This is a little weird.  I try to understand when Jimmy goes down this road.  Oscar in Riverhead.  Oscar.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Let me ask you a question.  You've been through the rehab, right?  I went through rehab when I was.  I was 17.  I was forced into rehab after it was more an attention cry than a suicide attack.  Right.  For alcohol, right?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Pretty much, right.  Yes.  All right.  Let me ask you a question.  The end game for alcohol and drug rehabilitation is to stop doing alcohol and drugs, right?  That's, yeah.  It's abstinence, yes.  All right.  What is the end game for sexual rehab?  Can I not have sex?  No.  It's so stupid.  Are you going to ask?  Are you asking because you want to ask or are you asking as a springboard into your...  No, I really want to ask the question because I think, to be honest with you, not for nothing, sexual addiction, this whole thing that's coming out is ridiculous. 
[00:54:30]  This is just because the guy is married, with a family, I understand he's doing dangerous things without using love and everything else, but this is ridiculous.  There's no such thing as a sexual addiction in my eyes.  You know what?  You just...  I think Anthony made the point before, or if he did, you get A-Rod out there, he's having sex with a bunch of people, how come he doesn't have a sexual addiction?  Again, to answer your question, what I think the end game with sex is, is the same as food, to do it in a healthy way.  And it doesn't mean you can't have a high sex drive or you can't be slightly perverted. 
[00:55:00]  I don't think that's what sexual recovery is, but I think that there's a balance that most people have.  To say you can't be a sex addict is ridiculous.  If you're telling me that me behaving the way I behaved in my life is normal, you have no comprehension of what you're talking about.  You really don't, dude.  And I'm pretty open and honest with my stuff.  But if you knew the hours I wasted online, the risks I took, the money I spent, when I could fuck a girl, but I didn't want...  I used to pass up fucking girls because I would go home and jerk off and then go out and get a prostitute. 
[00:55:30]  It was completely abnormal behavior.  And I'd back up Jimmy, Oscar.  I mean, we're lucky to have someone like Jimmy that is so honest about his personal life.  And, you know...  That's what I'm saying, though.  I understand.  It's different between what Jimmy's doing and A-Rod's doing.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  It's what he's into.  Just because, look, I don't agree with having dukes dropped on my chest, so I'm not going to do it.  If he can get someone to do it for him, hey, more power to you. 
[00:56:00]  What is your sexual life, like, Oscar, what is your sexual life?  In a nutshell, completely like, I mean, are you faithful in a relationship?  I'm a faithful man in a relationship for 10 years.  My wife and I have great sex.  We have two kids.  I don't look to stray.  I don't want to stray.  I have no interest in straying whatsoever.  Well, the Oscar, it's just you don't get it because you don't...  That protects us too much.  What's that?  That protects us too much.  I know.  I don't look at that girl down the street in her little underpants.  But maybe it's just not...  To deny it exists just because you're not involved with it is silly. 
[00:56:30]  Well, I don't know.  Maybe, maybe.  I don't know.  Look, I have sex in my life with girls other than my wife before I was married.  Yeah, sure.  I got married.  And I've done some pretty freaky things.  I don't want to be honest with you, okay?  But again, even if I did stuff that was out there, who is it affecting?  But me and the person that's doing it with me, right?  Maybe.  Hey, look.  It doesn't matter.  No one said the whole world is affected.  But if you're destroying your own life and feeling empty and disgusting after sex like 
[00:57:00]  I did for years, even with girls I was dating because I was using it as a get high  as opposed to just whatever you do with your wife.  See, you have great sex with your wife.  You love fucking her.  That's healthy.  That's great.  Even if you tie each other up and piss on each other, that's great.  But when you're using it as an escape and as something else, that's when it's unhealthy.  And that's for every individual to make that decision.  And Oscar, let me jump in here.  Before I knew Jimmy, I would have agreed with you.  I would have said this sex addiction thing is bullshit.  I really would have. 
[00:57:30]  I would have agreed with you.  But listening to Jimmy over the years, you realize, holy shit, you certainly could be  addicted to sex.  I understand.  But you understand the point they're trying to make.  It's not what he's doing is not hurting anybody.  That's the thing he may feel.  Wait, wait, wait.  Jimmy or Tiger Woods?  No, no, no.  No.  Anybody.  Anybody that's a sexual addiction.  So Tiger, hold on.  Tiger didn't hurt his wife or family?  How is Jimmy's...  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not talking about...  I'm talking about yourself.  If you're a single guy, take the family out of him.  I'm not talking about...  Okay.  You're a single dude, right?  You're going out there.  You can do whatever you want to do. 
[00:58:00]  You can feel any way you want to feel afterwards.  Okay?  So wait.  So the fact that...  Hold on.  I know what you're saying.  I'm not hurting myself at all.  Despite how it makes me feel time and time again.  Despite the fact that I know I'm doing it for the wrong reasons.  Despite the fact that I know I'm doing it to escape because I'm bored or because I have...  Whatever reasons I'm using it to escape for.  Jimmy, as a single guy, knows he's hurting himself with his sex addiction.  He's made that perfectly clear on our show.  All the time he wasted trying to get that sex high when he could have been working on stuff for his career. 
[00:58:30]  Or his personal life.  He doesn't hang out with his family that much.  I understand that.  He probably could have hung out with his family more if he wasn't searching out this high all these years.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Well, I'm not in Jimmy's world, but it's obvious that it has affected him as a single guy.  What, Oscar?  Let me ask you a question, Jimmy.  Sure.  If you're driving a car, okay?  If you had five prostitutes pissing your mouth, okay?  And the next day you drive a car, it's loaded up on cocaine. 
[00:59:00]  Not for nothing.  You're going to hurt yourself more with the cocaine, right?  Physically, sure.  Yes, physically.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  It's the fact that the chemical addiction is a legitimate thing.  I don't, in my opinion, I don't think that a sexual addiction is something that people should, oh my God, if you like sex with 50, look at this, throw them into a rehab.  A single guy doesn't make sense.  You don't have to, Oscar, you don't have to see it.  It's not important that you see it because maybe it doesn't affect you.  So you seeing it is not important to me or anybody else who knows it exists. 
[00:59:30]  And when you say something like, well, you're only hurting yourself, that's the same excuse people use who drink alcoholically and who drugs.  Hey, I'm hurting myself.  And yet, meanwhile, there are 12-step programs specifically for spouses and loved ones of people who drink, specifically for adult children of people who drink because you destroy people around you.  When you're destroying yourself and when you're making your own life completely unmanageable and completely miserable, people who love you feel it.  And people who love you are affected by it.  No one is an island who just affects themselves, regardless of what their addiction is. 
[01:00:00]  Well, I understand.  All right, okay.  I mean, look, you know, that's my point on it.  I understand what you're saying.  I don't necessarily agree with it, but I don't understand the point.  And you're lucky you have a good marriage, man.  Just be happy you got that.  You're lucky.  And, Oscar, that's our show.  It's fine.  You don't have to agree with us.  I mean, you've got your point out.  We've got a nice discussion in it, and that's fine.  Hope I bump into him in a glory hole somewhere.  The best part about this show is in five minutes, you're going to be hearing dick jokes.  So that's the best part.  I love this show.  Thank you, brother. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  Let's go to Derek in Columbus.  Derek.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hey, you guys need to check out a movie called Choke.  It's by the guy who wrote Fight Club.  I know.  It's all about...  I read the book, and I just never saw the movie.  Is it good?  The book's obviously supposed to be better, but the movie's pretty fucking good.  But pretty much, whenever they go to the rehab, they find every chance they can to go fuck  in the back room and whatever.  It's pretty much a meeting place to go out of sex.  Yeah, there were a lot of hot scenes in the book. 
[01:01:00]  That's for sure.  It was a lot of hot scenes in the movie, too.  It's worth checking out.  Is it a good movie?  I probably should have saw that one.  Yeah, it's one of the ones that kind of went under the radar, but it was good.  Oh, well, the opening part of the trailer looks pretty good.  It sure does.  Yeah, girl...  She's dancing in Titillation.  Oh, boy, is she?  It's a strip club called Titillation.  Wow, who's that?  That's a nice...  Rosie.  That's Rosie's skin tag. 
[01:01:30]  She's appearing at Titillation.  Thank you, Derek.  All right, thanks, guys.  I don't know where else to go.  The phones are just fucking lit.  You guys have spoke about the stranglehold that sex has.  Like, after you come, you realize what it is you've done.  Maybe the addict doesn't have that.  Jimmy, is it an addiction or a compulsion?  Do you want to answer that one, Jimmy?  Yeah, I don't know the difference.  I mean, for me, I'm such an addictive personality. 
[01:02:00]  It's almost like with gambling.  Like, I know that I'm such an addictive guy.  No, exactly.  There you go.  What?  But, yeah, you could say, like, I'm not hurting anyone but myself,  which, technically, it's your money or whatever.  But haven't you ever, after a bad night, just went,  what the fuck am I doing?  Like, I have this great life.  No, I go, I'll make it up tomorrow.  Okay, so you're still completely crazy.  I know.  But you understand that.  Hey, look, gambling is not...  You go like, oh, fuck.  Gambling is not physiological.  It is exactly like...  And you don't even have to gamble at all to live. 
[01:02:30]  But if you understand how much it could hurt...  But you can lose everything as far as finances, your house, things like that.  Sex addiction, you can lose your wife, this, that...  Half your finances.  Half your finances.  Your house.  Exactly.  But that's, again, married guy.  It seems to be that sex addiction will affect you a lot more if you're married than not married.  And it's called a sex addiction, I think, a lot more when you're married than when you're not married. 
[01:03:00]  When you're not married, you're a guy that is fucking a lot of chicks.  When you're married, you're a sex addict.  Look at what you did.  You destroyed your family.  You did this.  That's what affects your job.  I think it's more obvious if you're married.  Yeah.  Because maybe the single guy wants to be married and have kids and just never gets to that point.  I don't know.  Maybe the single guy wanted more from his career and never got there.  Look at Letterman.  I don't know Letterman's personal.  I really don't. 
[01:03:30]  I think it seems obvious that it affects married guys more, but I wonder if that's actually true.  Letterman's a guy fucking a girl, right, that he worked with.  Right.  And I don't know what, if that's all he was doing, just banging this chick at work, I wouldn't classify that guy as a sex addict.  That's a guy just having an affair.  And he's doing it with somebody where it's quiet.  I mean, to me, there's a difference between that and a guy behaving in a full-blown addiction.  And I don't know Letterman's circumstances, but if that's all he was doing was just banging this chick that he really liked.  Sure.  To me, that's different.  All right.  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut.  Choke is a story about the San Diego Chargers. 
[01:04:00]  Oh.  Go Jets, go.  Colts eat balls.  Go fuck yourself.  J-E-T-S.  My Jets are in the fucking AMS Championship.  You watch out for these Jets on Sunday.  I won't be watching, because I'll be at a christening.  Yes, you do do that, Michael Corleone.  I'll be watching.  I do renounce them.  Do you renounce this fun game and chips and all these fun things we're eating?  I do renounce them.  I think we've got to figure it out, but I'm not sure. 
[01:04:30]  Let's go to this guy who claims he has the whole inside story on Tiger's sex addiction since he was 19 years old.  Who's this?  Yeah, this is Exact Protect.  How you doing, guys?  Love your show.  I'm trying to.  Of course you do.  What does that mean?  I do protection details.  I've done it for 25 years.  Okay.  Since this kid is 19 years old, since he was an amateur, this kid has been addicted to sex.  And like Jimmy will tell you, just like any other addict, one addiction can lead to another addiction to another addiction. 
[01:05:00]  He cannot go without having sex.  This kid's been on the circuit.  The person that I protect has been in locker rooms with him, has been in tournaments with him.  And this kid has nothing but.  I understand that you're talking about marriage and being single, but there is no difference.  Just like an alcoholic can become a drug addict, a drug addict can become an alcoholic.  So you're saying that basically he's going, like, way beyond what most people see as just a guy getting laid, where it does cross over into a very unhealthy obsession. 
[01:05:30]  Jimmy, absolutely, Jimmy.  What you're talking about is someone who takes it to the extreme.  Someone who cannot go a day or a minute without having sex.  Or thinking about it, the action, the whole thing.  Just like a crack addict would be out on the streets looking for crack.  Well, how the fuck did he win all those tournaments then?  Well, listen, you know, if you look at his father's behavior, if you know anything about his father's behavior... 
[01:06:00]  I sure do.  His father had a lot of the same stuff going on in his life.  Well, just like an adult child of an alcoholic, the same thing.  The addiction, you know, is handed down.  Sometimes it's...  I don't want to say...  I'm not sure, Jimmy, if it's hereditary, but they say, you know, when one parent has it, there's like a 60% chance that, you know, the child will have it.  Yeah, I think it can be hereditary.  I think it's in the genes, as they say.  I think my dad's got that addictive personality. 
[01:06:30]  I think other people in my family have it.  So, yeah, I think that, you know, I don't blame my dad, obviously, because I made decisions.  Right.  But, you know, if it becomes an obsession, and somebody told me one time, obsession is a thought over which logic has no power.  And that made a lot of sense to me, even though that might not be the actual thing.  But I know that doing X, Y, or Z is bad.  I know the consequences, and that doesn't stop me.  I can logically write out why it's wrong.  It doesn't matter.  The obsession to do it is much stronger than the common sense which says don't. 
[01:07:00]  And physiologically, you got to, and Jimmy, you know, and you guys know about addiction, that there's a certain amount of gratification, immediate gratification.  When it becomes, it's psychological, it's physiological, it's more than just the act of sex.  It's a lot more than that.  Well, it's also, I think, the dopamine that the brain releases.  I imagine the brain releases the same chemical for most addictions.  I don't know exactly what it is, but I think the brain releases. 
[01:07:30]  What's that?  It's a super overload of endorphins.  That's what any addiction, I think you know that, Jimmy.  Isn't dopamine something the brain releases, like a specific chemical?  It's like a reward system.  And it's what makes us have sex, and what makes us eat, and things that sustain us.  And ours just gets out of whack, and all of a sudden you're rewarding yourself for fucking snorting white shit off a mirror, off a fucking kiss mirror.  Instead of just sex feeling good, so you reward yourself because you're procreating the species, you're jerking off with a fucking questionable friend to the next, you know, and then, boo. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  That's all apart.  I just fell apart.  I'm sorry.  You just came.  I got nervous.  Zach, what do you do on Tiger, though?  Anything else?  You know what?  The guy's in the rehab.  Like I said, the kid is as dirty as they come when it comes to sex and his addiction.  And, you know, it's a known fact.  I mean, this has not been a secret.  It's just, you know, I hear you guys. 
[01:08:30]  I listen to you guys every day.  I'm working 18, 20 hours a day.  I listen to your replays.  I listen to everything.  And I hear these idiot callers call in, and they think they have the answer to what's going on with this guy.  Listen, it's a simple thing.  It's just like just going to Harlem or going to Westchester, pick up a crackhead, and you've got the same person.  It's just that he's a celebrity.  He's got the money.  He's got the people.  Just like O.J. had the people to cover his ass.  This kid's got everything he wants, everything he needs to sustain an addiction. 
[01:09:00]  You know, quite honestly, you know, who knows?  You know, if Jimmy had that kind of cash, we might be talking about Jimmy.  Yeah, it is kind of, I think when you're a celebrity and you're that famous, like you said, there's people around you who will protect you.  Like Michael Jackson, when he was doing his thing, and they said his doctor, I mean, that's the charges, at least, that his doctor was giving him stuff.  It makes it much longer before your bottom becomes apparent because you have so many people protecting you and so many people telling you what you want to hear.  And people helping you avoid the consequences. 
[01:09:30]  They're still protecting Tiger.  Yeah.  You know?  They're going to protect him.  They're going to protect him just like they protected, just like the way the Olsens were protected, just like the way Heath Ledger was protected.  That is, you know, it's an unsung kind of, you know, like the blue wall that the police have.  Right.  You know, these celebrities have these people.  Of course.  They have a blue wall, too, and it's B-L-E-W.  A little hole in it.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:10:00]  I love you guys, man.  You take care.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Phone's still lit, but we should take a break.  We'll figure out if we continue with this or go somewhere else.  Dude, sex addiction is a massive...  It's complicated.  Wow.  People seem to really latch onto it.  Yeah.  A lot of people disagree.  It's definitely complicated.  Yeah.  It seems alcohol is an easier one to figure out or drugs, but...  Sex is just harder to admit.  Let's go around the room.  You think Tiger's a sex addict, and do you think he's doing this to really help you?  Help himself or get his image back and get back on that plateau? 
[01:10:30]  I don't think he's trying to help himself.  I don't think so, either.  Or anything.  He's just trying to get his image back.  I'm not really sure about if he's a sex addict anymore after this whole discussion.  I think he might be.  I think he's an addict.  I think he's doing it for the wrong reasons.  Probably right.  I mean, I don't know, but I would imagine...  Who knows?  I mean, you never know what clicks the first day you're in there.  Maybe it never clicks.  I don't know.  But I do think he's a fucking addict.  It is really an interesting story, man.  Yeah.  What?  I'm just laughing.  They're bringing up hysterical references over here. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, right?  Crocus.  Sort of Crocus in years.  Oh, the band with a K?  Yes.  Stop.  Assholes.  That's what you try to do with a Tiger Woods segue into a docking discussion.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  Crocus.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Brock Lesnar info.  We got so much stuff to do.  Wow.  Maybe we do move on.  There's an all-white basketball league that has people outraged.  Yeah, of course they're outraged.  By the way, we got a Saudi teen that is a bad, bad person for taking a cell phone to school. 
[01:11:30]  Yes, she is.  Well, she got what she deserves.  I wasn't sure.  Okay.  Getting what she deserves.  Yes, sir.  And the NYPD cop, the cop's wife drowning in a fucking pool.  What is that about?  That is tragic.  What happened?  A tragic story as well.  So we got a lot to do.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Gotta love the Who.  Playing halftime at the Super Bowl, right? 
[01:12:00]  It's cool.  I love the fact that Pete Townsend is allowed to play at halftime.  I'm kidding.  Three-time fucking kiddie point on his computer.  It's great.  No kidding, man.  Doing research, were you?  Yeah.  Keeping it family safe, are you?  Janet Jackson's terrible, but he's got fucking kiddie point on his computer, and he's fine.  Ah, dude, you just gave me hiccups with that.  Asshole NFL.  Fuck, I got the damn hiccups now.  Go Jets, by the way.  J-E-T-S, my Jets.  I bleed Jet green.  They got a big game coming up or something?  Sure do.  Whack, whack. 
[01:12:30]  Sure do.  I'm not a fan of Peyton Manning and his dumb hairdo.  You can't win a...  Someone...  Someone.  It's my brother-in-law.  He goes, you can't win the Super Bowl if you have a hairdo like Peyton Manning.  A hairdo.  My brother-in-law doesn't like his hairdo.  And he calls it a hairdo.  Uh, yeah, so the Who playing halftime at the Super Bowl.  I guess what?  What, the Steelers playing in the Super Bowl?  What year is this?  What fucking year is this?  It's the year that everything has to be kept nice and safe. 
[01:13:00]  Really?  Well, I remember going to the Who's farewell tour 20 years ago.  You know what?  It was 20 years ago.  It was at Rich Stadium in Buffalo.  It was the farewell tour of the Who.  And that was 20 to 21 years ago.  They're still playing.  So I got ripped off 20 years ago.  No, there's just a lot of places that they have to visit to say goodbye.  Oh, they're still saying goodbye?  Yay!  20-some odd years later?  Yay! 
[01:13:30]  Amy Fisher, what a whore.  God, you gotta love her.  Does her husband still listen to this show?  I don't know.  Because he's a fucking beast and I probably shouldn't have said what I just said.  Is he still her husband?  At least if I was getting beat up, it would be by a dude and not a girl like a certain radio host.  Oh, oh, oh.  You know, the guy that wants to box me got beat up by a girl.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Really, Mr. Hillbilly?  Amy Fisher, what's going on with Amy Fisher?  Apparently, she's become... 
[01:14:00]  Now, Opie, I don't think you should bash her like that because she's very charitable.  She's become very charitable.  What she's doing is gathering up some money to send to Haiti.  Well, that's very nice.  Very nice.  Is she doing all the proceeds or a percentage of them?  Who knows?  She's in Comac, Long Island stripping and she's giving money to Haiti for that.  She's fucking sexy, man.  Yeah, she kind of is, huh, Jimmy? 
[01:14:30]  I think I'm going to go.  I know where this place is.  It's very...  It's not far from me at all.  Is she still married to Joey Buttafuoco, too?  I think so.  It's like Gallagher, too.  That guy's an animal, man.  Oh, yeah.  He's intimidating.  He was in here.  He's crazy.  He doesn't know how to laugh.  What was he, ex-cop or something?  A million jokes and he barely broke a smile.  There we go.  That's a picture of Amy Fisher in the shower soaping up those nice breasts. 
[01:15:00]  I'd love a lap dance from her.  You know, it's hysterical.  She's doable.  She lives in the same development as my mom and Sal.  So you look at her in these little films and pictures of her in her house.  Yeah.  And it's like the same layout.  Oh, really?  It's the exact same house as your mom's?  It's like, hey, you're over my mommy's house sticking a dildo in you.  Is that mommy's couch that she's shoving a dildo off her ass?  It's great, man.  Oh, wait.  I don't know my holes.  Yeah.  Sometimes you don't know your holes. 
[01:15:30]  That's a higher hole.  Anyone else get confused when you see some of these pictures and you don't know your  holes?  Well, sometimes the hole's a little high.  It's like, wait, that's not her ass.  That's her pussy.  What are you going to do?  Oh, look at this.  Oh, God.  He's just plowing away in a nice big bed.  Like a big fucking gray gorilla on top of her.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Yeah, she's going to be dancing at a club.  What's the name of this place?  It's nice.  I don't know what it is.  Real nice.  Someplace in Comac.  Is it tonight?  Oh, yeah.  With proceeds going to Haiti? 
[01:16:00]  I think three days.  It's called The Scene, Restaurant and Lounge.  Really?  In Comac.  Yeah, The Scene.  And she's going to be dancing there for three days.  And I guess some of the pros, who knows how they're going to divvy this up, will be going  to help people in Haiti.  So her vagina, or actually her boobies, she's not allowed to show vagina out there.  Could you?  Yeah.  And you bring up something that should be said.  There's a lot of people that are doing the right thing for Haiti. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And they're raising a lot of money for that hellhole that is Haiti now.  Uh-huh.  But there's also other people that are just completely taking advantage of the Haiti situation and  making money for themselves.  So if you are going to donate, you really should do a little research to see, you know, where  the money is actually going.  Where is it going?  Because there's a guy on Twitter who's like, hey, for every person that follows me, I'll  give a dollar toward Haiti.  There's a lot of that going on on Twitter.  And, you know, if you download my song, so there's opportunists out there. 
[01:17:00]  Opportunists.  Opportunists.  Opportunists out there.  Opportunists.  They're not going to want Amy Fisher's money.  Why the money smells so bad?  I love Caribbean Jimmy.  This money smells like a pill to caca.  Caribbean Jimmy.  The gal put it in her vagina first.  Caribbean Jimmy rules.  We don't want the smelly money from the girl from Long Island.  Hey, Caribbean Jimmy, you just got back from Haiti, didn't you? 
[01:17:30]  What's going on down there?  Things ain't good, but they ain't bad enough that we need money from that dirty girl.  The money smells, man.  It smells like somebody rabbit-tupping fish like Luca Bronsi's vest.  You should take all donations.  You guys are desperate down there.  We're going to take the money.  We just got to peel off the top couple of bills and throw them in the river.  The gal vagina smell, bud.  Get it? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, I think we did.  I want to know what percentage of the proceeds the bitches don't in.  Holy shit.  Hey, someone doing the info already.  Amy Fisher, none of the fee.  So you pay a fee to go in.  She gets all that.  One out of the three nights of tips she's donating.  Now, how do you find that out?  We got a guy in the know on my fucking Twitter.  Really?  One out of the three nights.  If you want me to promote your Twitter, you've got to come up with better Twitter names, by the way. 
[01:18:30]  Okay, that's the flyer?  Yeah.  Let's see.  January.  No, it's January 4th, 2008.  I think that's a little old.  Yeah, sounds like we're going back into a time machine or something.  Oh, we are, Chip.  To a time before you came to this show.  I like being a part of the show.  People say I'm a sensation.  You're a sensation, all right.  That's what I say.  Like Caribbean Jimmy.  It's your dirty money.  The one who turned to your money. 
[01:19:00]  We've got people that have seen Amy Fisher dance.  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave!  Hey there, Dave.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, Dave.  How are you?  Better now that you called.  Oh, thank you.  Are we?  I actually looked out the window from my office for a little place here in Providence called the Cadillac Lounge.  Oh, sounds close.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  Uh, she came to dance here probably about two months ago.  Uh, actually a bunch of my guys at work went to go see her and said, you know, she was not a bad dancer at all and looked pretty damn good. 
[01:19:30]  Does she do lap dances or just feature?  They said they did some lap dances.  Oh.  Does she show you where the poo comes out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I doubt that one, but it's disgusting.  The sign of a good stripper is when she puts her asshole in your face and puckers it.  She Morse code puckers it.  Right.  Her fucking room number and cell phone number.  They were advertising this thing for, like, weeks that she was coming.  Was it mobbed?  And all this stuff. 
[01:20:00]  It was absolutely ridiculous.  Was it crowded?  Uh, yeah.  I, like I said, I didn't go, but they were talking about it.  All right.  So, thumbs up.  Thumbs right up her pussy for Amy Fisher.  Thumbs up her pussy.  The gal is just using our tragedy as a way to get people to see a shitty show.  I resent that.  I'm glad Caribbean Jimmy's back, because a lot of people pointing out the fact that there  probably isn't a river in Haiti.  Sure there is.  Didn't want to wreck your bed.  Who said the river was in Haiti?  I throw it into Dominican Republic. 
[01:20:30]  Bitches trying to shoehorn our tragedy to make ourselves some money.  I don't like it.  I think she is.  Do you like pussy?  I sure do.  Yeah.  But not when it's all over George Washington's face.  Bunch of rolled up, smelly, dead presidents.  I hope they don't send nickels.  What kind of strip clubs do you have in Haiti?  The same kind as here.  They keep trying to get me to do Haitian jokes, but I'm not going to commit career suicide. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, you know what?  Okay.  I was wondering.  Keep the jokes on Amy Fisher.  I got you.  I see where you're going with this.  You're too smart for me.  Joey.  Joey.  From Long Island.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Joey.  You know, there was a famous Joey from...  All right.  What do you got?  All right.  And I live in the same town as Sal and Rowe, and I see Amy Fisher and her kids at my daughter's  school all the time. 
[01:21:30]  She's just such an attention-seeking whore.  Oh, yeah?  She comes in, and she dresses up with her makeup, and she just...  It's six o'clock in the morning.  I mean, there's no reason why she should be dressed up like that.  She just starts to slut.  Well, she's a...  Yeah, but you know what?  When she got out of prison, she was doing the right thing, and she was trying to be a  writer and this and that, and then it looks like she just gave up on all that and went  right back to the slutty stuff.  Yeah.  She's very sexy to me, man.  You think?  Oh, my God, yeah.  I have a problem with her eyebrows. 
[01:22:00]  Why?  I really do.  She plucks them a lot.  I don't know if it's Botox, but they look a little too high on her head.  I don't know.  She, uh...  Yeah, she...  There's something going on with her fucking eyebrows that bother me.  I'm not saying it's logical, Jimmy.  It just bothers me.  All right, uh...  Oh, yeah, that's a very good idea.  Bud the trucker, bud.  Hey, Caribbean Jimmy.  Yes.  No, that's Jimmy.  Uh, can you...  Can you machete chip for me? 
[01:22:30]  What's that?  Can you machete chip for me?  I heard you.  Let's say hi to Mike in Georgia.  Mike?  Hey, do Caribbean Jimmy and Ted Bolt hang out together?  No, Ted Bolt was a one and done.  And because of the demand that run quickly.  All right.  You give a Bud set up, you get a Bud answer.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike, hey.  Good morning, gents.  Hey.  CNN breaking news as of four minutes ago. 
[01:23:00]  John Edwards admits he fathered child with a mistress.  He admitted that a while ago.  I want to check that out.  Everyone knew that.  He admitted that a while ago.  Well, I don't know...  Now he admitted it because he denied it in the past.  Yeah, I don't think he ever officially admitted it.  Oh, is this the first one?  I thought he did.  I mean, it was pretty much common knowledge, but now...  Wow, man.  He was that close to being the president, too.  Sure.  I don't care if he did this and was our president.  Yeah, not at all.  But the rest of America...  Not the rest.  A lot of people in America do.  One thing about McCain and Obama.  Neither one...  Take care. 
[01:23:30]  Obama and McCain.  Neither one of those guys has any kind of a weird, creepy, sexual scandal on their lives.  They're both pretty clean guys.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, see?  We got the story here.  John Edwards set to admit paternity of love child.  And now he officially...  Damn, yo.  He's done just that.  They knew it was head because the woman required 4,000 stitches on her vagina.  Because he has a big head, so his kid did, too.  Yes.  Congratulations.  It's a caricature.  He brought through a caricature. 
[01:24:00]  Giant skull.  What a fucking fathead he is.  I never liked John Edwards.  Big fathead.  He looks like John Ritter, but not.  Another one with a weird hairdo.  Yeah.  Fucking Lego person.  Let's talk about people in their weird hairdos.  JFK.  Who has a weird hairdo?  Hairdo.  I just love the word hairdo.  Me, too.  It's so 1950s.  Should do a couple quick things, because then we're going to get rich in here.  Do a little break and get rich in here.  We got a Boston Weatherman that makes a sexual innuendo. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  That's trouble.  Women like that when you do that.  Sometimes if I say it's going to rain tomorrow, I say it's going to be like your pussy when  it gets all wet.  Just stomping.  I bet that gets them.  Sure does.  It starts coming like crazy.  Wait, so are you going to see Amy Fisher tonight?  Yeah, I think I am.  All right.  I think I'm going to check that out, see what that disaster is all about.  There might be a line.  You've got to get...  He's Anthony!  I'll get in.  Well, you better call and then call ahead.  I'll get in.  Get a special fucking table.  Throw some of that money around and see what she could do. 
[01:25:00]  Easy come, easy go.  See how far you can get with Amy Fisher.  For real.  I'll give it a whirl.  I mean, you're in a strip club.  You've got the cash.  He's doing it for Haiti.  I'll do it.  It's perfect.  I'll check it out.  Oh, man.  We want our proceeds from blowjobs and buttfuckings, too.  Not just the admission girl.  Not just the dollars they'll throw at you.  You silly old lady.  Caribbean Jimmy, you've got another call on the line.  Shark in Missouri.  Shark.  Jimmy, I love you, but your Caribbean gym sounds more like a fucked up leprechaun. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  I've been told my accent is all over the place.  That's because I'm a world traveler.  That's great.  I love Caribbean gym.  All I hear is Caribbean, Jimmy.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I miss my husband, Andrew.  I miss Andrew.  I miss holding him in the middle of the night and kissing him face and wiping the spittle  off his lips with a garden hose.  Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  All right, Shark.  Let's go to this weatherman out of Boston.  A north wind at 13 miles an hour.  Picking up some snow, are we?  Yes, we are.  In Princeton, we picked up nine inches of snow.  Bill Ricca had seven.  The biggest amount that I could find, almost as big as me.  About nine inches.  Bill Ricca, seven.  And in Stoneman, we had six.  What the hell is that about?  That fucking guy rocks.  First of all, what a terrible delivery.  Almost as big as me. 
[01:26:30]  We got it.  Horrible delivery on the joke, but fucking A for fucking F.  And he leaned into the camera when he said it.  Did he really?  Can we see the video?  Almost as big as me.  So he's got like ten inches.  I'll tweet this fucking video for everybody.  Channel 7 up in Boston.  This is a big channel.  Big station.  Big guy news station.  Is he fired?  I don't know.  There's videos everywhere this morning, though.  He's a smart man.  He's a smart man.  He's a fired motherfucker.  A fired?  You think he is? 
[01:27:00]  Yes!  He's gone.  Yeah, because it's not a slip up.  You can't do a my dick is nine inches joke and then explain it again.  You're a weather guy.  Almost as big as me.  Good one.  We got it the first time you said it.  I hope they fire him.  I hate him.  You hate him?  I hate weathermen.  They're fucking smug wannabe stand-ups.  Fucking pussy.  They always try to be a little funny.  Exactly.  Put down the clouds and pick up a mic.  That's what I say.  That's a cunt.  Jesus.  Here we go. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, it's already gone.  Yeah, of course.  They fucking yanked it.  Motherfuckers.  That sucks.  But he leaned into the camera?  Yeah.  Like, step aside, folks.  Yeah, almost.  Here comes a big joke.  As big as me.  Nine inches.  Then he says nine inches.  Huh?  What is that?  What the hell was that?  Did you guys hear that noise?  That's the noise I hear in my head before a thought comes. 
[01:28:00]  Brilliant thought comes out.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  We got Leno stuff.  We got Brock Lesnar.  Brock Lesnar is going to be back.  Brock.  What is that sound?  I don't know.  What the hell is it?  It's Steve I-M-ing me.  Yes.  Is it really?  Hello, twink.  What is he writing today?  I'll find the clip.  Give me a sec.  Hey, do we have any Leno?  Because I think Leno hit back.  You want to hear Leno instead?  I do.  I want to hear both.  But I think Leno hit Letterman. 
[01:28:30]  Brock Lesnar spoke for the first time in a while.  Since that horrendous sickness of his.  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck that is.  I think it's intestinal.  Intestinal bacteria.  That's ugly.  Leno takes a shot at Letterman.  Okay, let's see.  Oh, wow.  I thought it was a funny joke, too.  Letterman was on fire.  I've been watching Letterman clips lately on YouTube.  Literally?  Is he burning?  He set himself on fire.  Fucking guys.  I'm telling you, he's great when there's some shit going on.  He should be like that every night.  Yeah.  He's taking shots at everybody. 
[01:29:00]  He sounds like a fucking shock jock at this point.  Shack jack.  He's taking on everybody.  Here's Jay Leno from last night.  Letterman.  Letterman's been hammering me every night.  Oh, going after me.  Hey, Kevin, you know the best way to get Letterman to ignore you?  What's that?  Marry him.  Okay, that's the best way.  Oh!  He will not bother you.  He won't look you in the eye.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Looks like Leno has finally had it.  Wow.  The gloves are off.  God bless him. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, the gloves are off.  God, that's a great joke.  That is a funny goddamn joke.  And I tweeted that joke last night because somebody sent it to me, and people were like,  oh, you suck at Leno's dick.  It's like, that's a great joke.  How could you be such an unbiased nerd that you don't think that's a great joke?  Yeah, it's a good one.  That's a funny, it's a fucking gloves and white joke, too.  Wow.  Wow.  I think I'm sort of team Leno just because of Jim Norton.  That's probably why.  I never really watched Conan a lot.  I'm not saying he sucks by any means, but I'm probably in Leno's corner because we've 
[01:30:00]  been on the show once.  Leno's been nice to us.  He's plugged our show, and Jimmy's on all the time.  But with that said, I'm loving all of this.  I don't give a shit where the shots are coming from.  I don't care when Conan fights back and punches hard.  I'm loving all of it.  I agree.  I do, too.  I think you're going to see ratings go up on everything.  This is just great TV.  On everybody's show.  No, of course.  You're going to see ratings go up.  I think more people are watching late night.  Well, they're definitely watching the clips on YouTube and all the other sites because 
[01:30:30]  they're getting hit a lot.  Louis C.K. wrote a pretty interesting thing because Louis C.K. started with Conan.  I think Conan gave him his first job, and Louis wrote an interesting little blurb about  the whole, as a guy who knows.  What was his take on it?  I think he said that he feels bad for Conan.  He likes Conan.  But I think he's saying that what Leto did was pretty incredible.  I don't think he thinks that Conan's getting fucked.  Yeah.  Conan's not getting fucked.  I don't think so, either.  Of course not.  It is just a bunch of...  He's walking away with a lot of money, and he's also going to walk away with the opportunity 
[01:31:00]  to work sooner than later.  Yeah.  He'll be fine.  He'll be fucking fine.  I don't feel sorry for Conan.  He's going to be just fine.  Actually, this is going to really, really help him in the end.  You know what people are forgetting is that a new company came in.  Comcast Cable bought NBC from GE, and a new boss came in and said, this is what's going  to happen.  That happens when a company...  After we merged, it went from fun to yuck.  That's the way it is.  People are forgetting there's a new boss in place, though.  That's pleasantries, though, right? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Pleasantries.  Nothing about pleasantries.  Here's more Jay.  Winston Churchill said, success is going from one failure to another without a loss of  enthusiasm.  Oh, what he meant, and he was a little early with this, but welcome to NBC.  All right, Arsenio Hall, ladies and gentlemen.  You don't need that.  Why is Arsenio there?  Arsenio's been popping up lately.  Yeah.  How has he?  Yeah, I think on Jay's show a few times.  Oh, I haven't...  Yeah.  I don't have confidence in these other two clips.  Who pulled these? 
[01:32:00]  What do you think?  What?  Steve, he's the king of...  That clip sucked.  Steve's the king of the late night of coverage.  I have Letterman's monologue, where he takes many shots at Leno.  You want that?  Yeah, let's hear it.  All right.  Is it going to hurt you, Jimmy?  Not at all.  Please, no.  Because, you know, you're sucking Jay's dick and all.  Oh, damn.  Bigger than Dave's, Fallon's, and Conan's combined, from what I hear.  I hear Letterman's quite the cocksman.  Look, let's be honest with each other.  If you had to suck a late night host dick, it would have to be Jay.  Because you know Jay wouldn't tell on you. 
[01:32:30]  He'd keep it under his hat.  Right.  He's quiet.  But it is amazing on Twitter how people...  Like, no matter how logical your argument is, they're like,  You're just a paycheck.  Your fans don't like it because you're just trying to give...  Shut your faggot face.  Shut it.  Shut up.  I haven't...  I have not...  I'm very much with Leno, and I have not once shit on Conan or Letterman.  And I'll probably never do Conan show.  I have not bashed Conan.  I don't think he stinks.  I don't think Letterman's...  It's like, how can I be fucking...  I think I'm being kind of fair. 
[01:33:00]  I just think that Jay is right.  I think he's in the right place.  Absolutely.  I don't blame a guy for wanting his number one show back.  Sorry.  Sorry, you fucking underachievers out there.  Sorry.  But he fought for fucking 16 years and he stayed number one.  Sorry.  I don't think you should have to give that up.  I guess all you people think that he should be fucking Taft Hartley'd into a fucking gig.  You know, maybe Conan should get it, but I think that when you're number one, you should  stay there until you're fucking done.  Sorry, folks.  Yeah, it's ridiculous to think that it's his fault.  It's a lot of entitled fucking people out there. 
[01:33:30]  And I'm not talking about people that love Conan or hate Leno.  Those are both fair opinions.  Well, you've got to respect their protecting their guy.  Protecting their guy is one thing.  I definitely respect the Conan fans for rallying for Conan and all that.  Absolutely.  I absolutely do.  But the sense of entitlement, I don't respect.  But logically, you can see that this makes sense as far as NBC goes.  Any of these fans who think the number one guy should be taken out so the guy they like  should be put in is one of these entitled motherfuckers who doesn't want to have to fight for 
[01:34:00]  and earn their position.  Don't go to fail block immediately.  They have the weatherman clip before they yank it.  Sam's got it.  Sam's got it.  Oh, you got it?  Let's go back to that and then we'll do the letterman thing and then we'll get Rich Voss in here.  Here's a...  It's on...  Now our windshield factor about 23, humidity 85%.  A north wind at 13 miles an hour.  Picking up some snow, are we?  Yes, we are.  In Princeton, we picked up nine inches of snow.  Bill Ricca had seven.  The biggest amount that I could find, almost as big as me, about nine inches. 
[01:34:30]  Bill Ricca had seven.  Wow.  You know what?  You know what?  About two and a half.  Brookline picked up about two.  You know what?  When you see the video, it worked perfectly.  Yeah.  It really did, Jim.  You got to admit.  He stepped into the camera.  He stepped up dramatically, paused, and then delivered.  It works with the visual element.  Fuck, that's balls.  Yeah, that is good.  Boy, is he fired.  He's so fired.  Not even just fired.  So fired.  He is so fired.  So fucking fired.  Here's Letterman.  In Southern California, it's pouring rain. 
[01:35:00]  It's one of those times a year in Southern California when it's raining like crazy out  there in Los Angeles, and there's flooding all over L.A., flooding everywhere.  So I'm thinking to myself, whoa, it's a good thing Conan O'Brien is getting sandbagged because  Okay, here's what's going on.  They got the floods, they got the mudslides, and as usual, the only thing left standing is 
[01:35:30]  Jay Leno.  Hey.  He's there.  Let me ask you this.  In contractual negotiations, are you fascinated by legal detail?  Listen to this.  Conan O'Brien, he had the Tonight Show, and now he's leaving, and NBC is negotiating with  him, and it's that intellectual property.  He can't take his signature comedy bits with him. 
[01:36:00]  But that's okay.  Jay will take them.  So it's going to work out just fine.  Not a problem.  Not a problem.  And they're saying Conan O'Brien, bless his heart, gets $32 million to walk away from  NBC, to leave NBC.  And I was thinking, you know, when I left NBC, all I got was a restraining order.  That's...  Well, I got...  But things are starting to settle down now, and Jay, I guess we'll be going back to the 
[01:36:30]  Tonight Show at 11.35, and he's been off the Tonight Show for seven, eight, nine months  or something like that.  So he's got to get back in shape.  So he's spending an hour a day working out on the Chin Master.  So that'll be...  That'll be good.  Can you pause for one second?  It's done.  Now, I like...  If you notice the guys hammering Leno the hardest, whether it was Rosie, who felt slided 
[01:37:00]  by Jay, Conan, who felt slided by Jay, and Dave, who lost consistently to Jay, he said  the people that are hitting him the hardest are people who have a vested interest in him  not being there.  Yeah.  And I just wish that a lot of the people who are hate Leno...  If you don't think he's funny, that's totally acceptable.  But it's almost like, of course Letterman doesn't want him back, because he was fucking  winning.  You know?  And that's not a knock on Letterman.  That's common.  I wouldn't want a guy back who was winning either.  Yeah.  True.  Nobody is saying that stuff.  Like, why are fans not saying that stuff? 
[01:37:30]  So Letterman can't be happy that Leno's getting his old spot back, right?  It's amazing.  Would you be...  Can you...  Do you understand the irony?  Now, again, I think he started Conan's show, so I'm sure Letterman has very genuine feelings  towards Conan and very genuine dislike for Jay.  But he...  Conan is his competitor.  He's kicking the shit out of Conan, and he's on TV kind of lamenting the fact that Conan  will no longer be there.  And the guy who was beating him is coming back.  Yeah.  He cannot be happy.  I wouldn't be either.  That's human nature.  All right.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  We don't want to spend too much time on this. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, not at all.  Because we've done a lot of time on this one.  We've got to get to the boss or something.  I think Leonardman's been very funny, and I think Conan's been very funny, too.  Let's try to make this fast.  We've got two calls, and then we go to break.  Paul in Jersey, what do you got?  Hi.  Good evening.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, bang.  Hey, what's up?  Jimmy, I just want to start off by saying I do completely agree with you, and I don't think  Leno's in the wrong at all.  But I think people like Bastion on Twitter, because of the fact that the way it comes  off, like, Letterman's been killing Leno the last couple nights, and you don't hear  nothing about it.  There's been some funny jokes, but as soon as Jay dropped a joke, you're, like, Twittering 
[01:38:30]  it.  I don't agree with you.  I Twittered.  I'm not going to interrupt you, but I Twittered one Leno joke.  Well, we should interrupt him.  Jimmy loves comedy, and it was a great line, and I laughed at that line.  We played a lot of Letterman's monologues.  We said how funny Letterman has been.  I didn't say Letterman hasn't been funny.  Letterman's been very funny.  I never, and I don't like what he's saying about Jay, because I love Jay, but a good joke  is a good joke.  But that joke, somebody, I retweeted that Leno joke last night, but you couldn't see the 
[01:39:00]  retweet because it was too many characters.  I just, I read that on Twitter and retweeted it.  It was a funny fucking line.  Yeah.  That's all.  Jimmy, it was a hysterical line.  I agree.  It's just, though, I know, I agree with you.  I agree with you, but I'm saying, the rest of these morons, they've probably seen it  as, oh, look at this.  As soon as Jay said something funny, Jimmy tweeted it right away.  He's pissing his ass.  And they're wrong, and Jay's right, and he is the king, and that's why nobody wants him  back, because nobody wants anybody who's better than them back in their time slot.  And this move is hurting me. 
[01:39:30]  People don't seem to understand that.  I think I've been pretty fair in the discussions.  I haven't slammed Conan at all.  Not even once.  Not even in a backhanded way.  This move is not good for me.  I was getting spots on primetime television.  Will I be a part of the new one?  I hope so, but no one has said I'm going to be.  I may just go back to where I was, which is a guy that they like to have on once in  a while.  So the move is not good for me either, brother.  It's not like I'm moving upwards.  It's not a good move for me.  Very good.  They all love you, Jimmy.  You're going to the top.  This is the year of Jimmy Norton. 
[01:40:00]  Norton.  I've been saying that since 01.  True, but they forgot about that.  Steve from Germany slash Huntington writes, holy shit, I see shades of you guys and Howard  in this late night war.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Howard should not be talking about anyone fucking over somebody else.  Why?  Trust me on that.  Trust me on that.  Howard should shut his fucking mouth about fucking people over.  John in Jersey. 
[01:40:30]  John.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, Chad.  That was just a quick shot.  Relax.  It'll be all right.  Over the bow?  Just a little quick shot.  Because he has a lot to say on this.  Really?  Like you didn't live that fucking life there, Howie?  Go ahead, John.  I do not understand how you guys could say that Conan didn't get fucked.  I mean, I understand that Conan didn't get fucked by Jay, but Conan most definitely got  fucked by NBC.  And, you know, I just think that for people to side with Conan because he got fucked, there's 
[01:41:00]  nothing wrong with that.  I mean, I just think that it's important to make the distinction that Jay was not the  one who fucked him.  Can I, I mean.  You're right.  You're right.  But can I ask you a question, though?  And I, and I, I get, I really like Conan's fans.  They are hardcore.  They love this guy.  And in a way, I understand why they're saying he got fucked.  And I think by the network he did.  I should amend my statement.  But how come nobody felt Leno got fucked when he was forced out of the Tonight Show and  stuck at 10 o'clock?  It's almost like the leeway they're giving Conan.  He didn't have enough time.  And they're right.  He didn't.  No one said the same things about Jay. 
[01:41:30]  They were like, fuck him.  He sucks.  After two nights on the air, they were killing him.  So it's like if there was a balanced support, like, yeah, Leno got fucked.  I would kind of go with it, but they're not doing that.  I think a lot of people think Leno got fucked, but Conan's fans are more proactive.  Yeah, I agree.  His fans are not proactive whatsoever.  They might be a little older and, I don't know, they're not as internet savvy.  I don't know.  They're not into the social networking as much as the Conan people.  They're just not as interested in talking about it.  They just go home and watch in the rating show that they watch.  Right.  But you're right.  They're not as internet proactive. 
[01:42:00]  No, I don't think so.  I think there's a reason for that, though, Jimmy.  I think because, like, right now, Conan's getting fucked and everyone's talking about  how shitty NBC is.  But when NBC made that move five years ago, I mean, you guys played the Cliffs.  Everyone was acting like it was all happy and hunky-dory.  So no one felt like Leno was getting fucked because he was going on the air saying everything  was fine.  No, you're right.  And him and Conan both did.  Both of them kind of towed the company line.  Yeah, they both did.  I mean, they're both against smarter people than we are.  Leno does seem to be able to sit there and just go like, hey, well, whatever. 
[01:42:30]  You know, without really bashing the company in a way where they'll tell him to go fuck  himself.  Like, the guy knows how to keep his job.  Gee, what an asshole.  Yeah.  And how does, to me, the amazing part is we've worked under, it's really hard, especially  as a comic, to keep your mouth shut.  It's really hard to do that when you're annoyed at your bosses.  And I have had to bite my tongue here so many times.  And I've let it, like, seep out the resentment.  And watching him on that last episode, he had Conan on. 
[01:43:00]  Like, you'd never know there was any resentment.  He's just a smart dude.  And again, Conan, too.  You'd never know there was anything weird going on with him either.  Yeah.  I don't know how you live in that.  Dude, I don't know how you live like that.  I wish I could live like that a little bit.  I wish.  I just can't.  I hold a fucking grudge.  It's horrendous.  Think about what would have happened five years ago if Leno was saying, yeah, they want  to do this and move Conan here in five years.  But fuck that.  I don't want to do that.  And he was on the air, you know, bashing NBC, saying the same shit. 
[01:43:30]  There's no way they would have made that move back then because they knew that at the  time Leno was number one.  And that's when really, you know, he had all the power because they didn't think five  years from now he would still be number one.  But, you know, they didn't do that.  I think it would have been a different story if he did.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I'm sure it just made no.  Obviously, it made no business sense to do it because the way it's worked out for him,  you know, he got what he wanted, I think.  All right.  And we're going to leave it right there today because we spent a lot of time on that subject  yesterday or the day before.  And it'll keep popping up.  Of course. 
[01:44:00]  But a couple of headlines, I think NBC, Conan O'Brien has reached a $45 million exit deal.  That poor bastard.  Wow.  That's amazing.  That is breaking news.  NBC, Conan O'Brien reaches $45 million exit deal.  He was hanging in there to get some money for his staff, which is pretty damn cool.  Yeah.  They said that they did.  I think it was $7 million.  Again, this is the rumor I heard yesterday that he was looking for $7 million for the  staff, but he didn't want it to come out of his money because NBC was going, well, you're  making the decision to leave.  Yeah.  It's like, no, fuck you.  Personally, I think NBC didn't handle this one more. 
[01:44:30]  What are some of the details in that?  I can't really see that, Sam.  Well, the staff is now getting $12 million.  It says O'Brien gets more than $33 million.  NBC said the rest will go to his staff in severance.  Wow.  $12 million.  He's got a big staff, though, right?  That money's going to get thinned fast.  Well, he really wanted to take care of, you know, his little, what, his co-host, what's  his name there?  Andy Richter and his producer.  His producer's name is Jeff Ross.  Yeah, you know Ross?  I hear he's what?  Jeff Ross's producer?  I don't know.  No, you're thinking of Ross.  Oh, I'm thinking of Bob Ross. 
[01:45:00]  You're thinking of Bob Reed and Ross Mark from The Tonight Show.  Okay, right, right, right.  This is, uh, Jeff Ross is his producer.  He's walking away with it.  Jonathan knows well, and he says he's a great dude.  I've never met him.  I'm sure he is.  So there you go.  That's breaking news.  And the other thing, uh, the rumor, uh, what, Sam?  Conan will be free to begin another TV job as soon as September.  Jesus, that's...  Well, they didn't pay a plan.  They sat him for a few months.  September is what?  Ten months.  September's kind of far away.  October, November, three years.  No, it's about eight months or anything, but September 1st.  He gets a nice vacation.  He says as soon as September. 
[01:45:30]  We're almost, uh, at February.  So March, April, May, June, July, August, September.  Seven, eight months.  30 days.  That's not that bad.  September, April, June, and November.  They say it takes that long just to get a new show on the air, so...  Yeah, it's...  And, uh, I guess it's not a rumor anymore.  Then that probably means Conan's last show is tomorrow.  Because they've been...  Yeah.  It says, uh, Conan, his final show will be Friday, so tomorrow.  And then, uh, Leno will return to tonight on March 1st.  March 1st.  Well, they got the Olympics, that's why.  Uh, and supposedly Conan's having Tom Hanks on tomorrow. 
[01:46:00]  Look, we're promoting Conan's last show.  And supposedly Will Ferrell is stopping by.  Wow.  It's gonna be a biggie.  Well, he could have, literally, Sam Roberts and Jim Norton, and people would tune in.  Of course.  Well, it's not Sam Roberts.  You like how he threw me in to be polite?  I really wanted to say Sam Roberts and Danny Ross, but I threw me in just to kind of show  some fake humility.  You rock.  Do we have Louis C.K.'s thing?  Because Louis C.K. knows Conan.  It's not that long, I don't think.  Oh, what did he say?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:46:30]  Um, I guess Louis was being interviewed during his panel, however.  One of the last questions was about the whole Conan-Leno debate.  You'd think Louis would have sided with Conan, who gave him his first shot as a comedy writer.  He did, but he had an interesting take on the matter.  Why would Conan want the old, moldy Tonight Show instead of a show with his name on it?  After saying that Conan will be fine, C.K. said that when he was watching late-night TV,  he felt the Tonight Show was more of a show for parents, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know why you'd give up your own show to host the Tonight Show, which is just this  old, shitty thing C.K. mused. 
[01:47:00]  He thinks Conan will be able to be Conan on whatever new show he's on, not having to conform  with whatever being the host of the Tonight Show is.  It's a little presumptuous of me to tell Conan that his dreams are misguided, but they are.  He said he talked about, even though Jeff Zucker, whatever, so he didn't bash Leno at all,  but he said he thinks that Conan wanting to be the Tonight Show host is a little misguided.  He should pretty much just stay with what he does.  Yeah, it was.  What he does, what he did best, is the after the Tonight Show guy.  Yeah, or just go to another network and do your thing and be quirky on a network with 
[01:47:30]  that, you know.  And you know what?  Tony brings it.  We'll end with Tony before the break, and we'll get Rich Vossen here.  We'll go right to break after this.  Tony, go ahead.  Hey, how do I get a job where I fail miserably, and then I get paid millions of dollars?  Look at all these athletes who, you know, oh, you know, you should get all this money  and stuff like that.  For what?  You know what?  If I don't perform in my job, I'm out on my head.  And it's showbiz is amazing, isn't it?  And it's your job as the average Joe to feel sorry for the guy that he's walking away with 
[01:48:00]  that much money.  This is an insane world.  Thank you, Tony.  Rich Voss next.  Stay there.  Let's say good morning to Rich Voss, everybody.  What's going on?  Believe it or not, we love this guy.  That's your intro today.  Hey, Rich, where are you playing?  Oh, wait.  I might have it right here.  I'm going to give you a nice plug, Rich.  That's what I do.  Comedy Zone, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  What?  Tomorrow? 
[01:48:30]  Tomorrow and Saturday.  Tomorrow and Saturday, the Comedy Zone in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  And then Uncle Vinny's, but that's next weekend by Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  Let's pack this Comedy Zone out for Rich Voss.  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The first shows are already almost sold out.  And Voss, you were really funny during the break.  I mean, you've got to save this material for the year.  Well, I've noticed that I've been going over like my last ten times here.  And if you had like Hall of Fame days, I think I would have made it.  I've had a lot of fun. 
[01:49:00]  I think it's a new studio.  I just, it's more intimate.  It's more, it feels like more of a family here, not like a family.  You're so mistaken.  We fucking hate this place.  Dad, can I have that money you owe me?  Fuck you, son.  You're right.  This does feel like a family.  It does feel like a family.  You know, I went for a...  Really?  Our old home was a lot bigger and had a lot more bathrooms.  This is like a family, you're right.  But Dad, you promised. 
[01:49:30]  Fuck you.  I didn't promise.  No, really.  I want to leave the place I currently live in and go back to living like I did when I was in college.  You're right, Rich.  You're right.  I don't know.  Because that's kind of what happened to us.  Something about how you just feel...  I can't tell you how many people that are friends of the show and guests that saw the old place and the new place are like,  What happened?  I'm like, well, they told us it was going to be great.  What can I tell you?  What happened?  You guys had that great facility.  It was huge.  You had the crowd, the bleachers. 
[01:50:00]  What happened?  You could put a fan out in front of that window.  No, we're really not allowed to.  You can't have people?  No, not really.  And we can't have the show on outside the studio.  It's a whole...  Because, you know, radio really needs to be corporate.  Because, you know, that's how you get good radio done.  Kevin from Connecticut says,  What sounds like old Spock in the new Star Trek.  What's up?  Is he loose today?  No, I had him re-cemented yesterday.  Re-cemented?  Oh, wait till you hear this one.  Oh, wait till you fucking hear this. 
[01:50:30]  Who knew cum worked as cement?  Oh, Jesus.  Last week I went for my last three implants where they drill through my gum into the bone and screw in the implant.  What implants?  Two teeth and a brain.  That's right.  Well, stop.  He's on fire.  So they screwed the three implants in.  I mean, they drilled the hole through my gum into the bone.  Before they screwed the implants in. 
[01:51:00]  All right, hold on.  I want to slow you down.  Because I'm a wimp at the dentist for real.  Like, when they're cleaning my teeth, I almost have to get fucking Novocaine.  It's ridiculous.  How much pain is that?  And what do they do?  Do they knock you right out?  No, first of all, they're Novocaine.  Because you're not really allowed to have anything, right?  No, Novocaine.  They numb you, yeah.  Well, but they shoot it into the roof of your mouth first.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  It's not like half your head.  And you can feel, like, they're shooting right here into the roof. 
[01:51:30]  You know what it's like getting shot in the mouth.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Right?  Fuck yeah.  But the needle doesn't come through a hole in the wall.  So they shoot it.  That was good.  Over-explain it.  I know.  Rich, I know.  See how much that hurts?  You didn't need to punch that up.  You were right there.  I know.  I got greedy.  Perfect.  It did get greedy.  But go ahead.  Into the roof.  And then they shoot into the gums and here.  And you could feel it going in.  So, and then.  Oh, look at this.  Why did Voss need anything? 
[01:52:00]  He's already a numbskull.  I'm changing my image in this fucking radio show.  In this environment.  You're hilarious.  I know, but I don't want people to think I'm as dumb.  You know what it is?  People should realize that you're hilarious.  But one thing I want to say, you ever have so much Novocaine, you feel like it's going  to stop your breathing and you're swallowing and you're going to choke to death?  The other day.  It's like a, it's a creepy feeling.  The other day he said, you might have to breathe through your nose.  And I go, well, I can't.  You know, because my sinus and all that. 
[01:52:30]  Well, you don't breathe through your nose?  No way.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I can't.  That's one of my biggest fears in my life.  Wait, blow out your nose right now.  What's that?  Blow out your nose.  He's not kidding.  He can't open his mouth.  You can't.  Like a bull.  Well, that's my biggest fear that somebody breaks my house and duct tapes my mouth.  Or walks up on stage and does the same thing.  Come on.  That wasn't bad. 
[01:53:00]  Served a little more.  That was good.  Okay.  Oh, God.  They're showing fucking video.  Okay, you see those implants?  Oh, they just pulled your teeth out of your head.  Wait, so you think you know pain?  So last week, he drilled through the gum into the bone.  Holy shit.  And then he took a metal rod and put it in a hole and was banging up my bone with a hammer.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  So he can knock the bone up to give more sinus passage or something or put a bone graft in there.  So he was knocking.  The metal rod was up into my head. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  And it was banging in there.  Oh, my God.  And I could hear the banging in my head.  And I thought it was going to...  Oh, my God.  I fucking...  I can't believe I was getting hard when this was happening.  Why would you?  It was painful.  Huh?  Oh, literal Jim.  It was unbelievable.  So, and then he...  So all the major work is done.  And Dr. Gottesman, who's doing the drilling, the... 
[01:54:00]  All right, what?  Whatever.  There's two dentists, Gottesman and Holtzman.  The guys are great, man.  Are you finally done?  We've known you for, what, 10 years?  It's a year and a half.  Fucking teeth.  It's almost a year and a half procedure.  But once it heals, then they put in the real teeth.  Finally.  Yeah.  Now that you're...  And I'll probably like have a fucking heart attack the next day.  Now that you're a senior citizen, you're finally going to have real teeth.  Yes.  That's good.  I'm telling you.  You're not putting metal studs in your mouth. 
[01:54:30]  I can't look at this video.  I can't look at it.  Rich Voss at the dentist.  Oh, it is kind of fucking gross, huh?  God damn it.  Look at that.  It's Rich Voss at the dentist on YouTube, if you want to check it out.  That's fucking horrific.  You can't go to the doctor.  Like, I went and got a chest x-ray a couple weeks ago.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So the fucking person that takes the x-ray, just the clicker of the machine.  The x-ray tech?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  The clicker of the machine?  After I'm done with the fucking x-ray, she comes out and says, do you smoke? 
[01:55:00]  No.  Well, why the fuck?  Don't ask me questions, because that's what my doctor's supposed to do.  You're just the x-ray machine clicker.  Now, for two weeks, I was having such anxiety attacks.  I'm going, well, why would she ask that unless she saw something?  Of course.  I'm with you, by the way.  You know, don't fucking do it.  I'm fucking with you.  Shut your mouth.  Your fucking job is to take the picture and let my doctor do the talking.  Shut your fucking mouth.  But I couldn't.  I was planning my will. 
[01:55:30]  Who am I going to give my golf clubs to?  Everything.  I think the tapes I'm going to make for my funeral, I was going to make a tape of stand-up.  Oh, you're going to do that?  Yeah.  Why?  So everyone else would want to kill themselves?  I mean, it came back negative.  You know, but don't fucking, don't say anything if you're not the doctor.  Do you, and you agree?  I concur.  I just said, hi.  Will you shut up?  I concur.  Well, I got a lot of my fucking mind.  I haven't been here in a while.  It's been a couple fucking weeks.  Your Brett Favre stuff was pretty funny.  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about football because Rich asked me, he goes, do you think the Jets have 
[01:56:00]  a shot?  And it's a really good question because I told Rich that the Jets, that start of the  season, is a much different team than where they're at now.  This Rex Ryan's got them motivated and believing that they could do this.  And Sanchez kind of coming into his own.  I'm going to say kind of.  Still a rookie quarterback.  Still a little green.  I mean, but the Jets have that great defense, but Peyton Manning is an animal, so I don't  know what to tell you on that.  I really do believe they have a shot.  I mean, if they beat the Chargers at home like they did, they got a shot with the Colts. 
[01:56:30]  What do you call it?  See, I don't watch it.  If you don't gamble.  You don't like football?  No, I don't.  If you don't gamble, why watch it?  What's the sense?  You know what I mean?  I don't check in.  I love.  For fun?  Well, I don't play cards for fun, but I'll watch football.  Okay, so same thing.  When you have a naked girl on your bed for fun and not touch her, what's the sense?  That's a dumb analogy.  Football is a pretty cool sport to watch, especially on TV.  I'd rather watch golf.  It's the best sport to watch on TV.  Hockey is the best sport to watch live, in my opinion. 
[01:57:00]  My dumb opinion.  Baseball is whatever.  It's just a bunch of fans.  Well, that's what sports are.  How would you know what that looks like?  Yeah, yuck to the fans, right, Rich?  Who needs them, right, Rich?  Filling seats and hitting bonuses.  Who needs that?  They're just fans.  You can't enjoy a sporting event.  Golf.  I've watched golf because I never gambled.  Because you're an ex-gambler.  Yeah, I mean...  What about golf, though?  I watch golf.  You could get some action on the golf games.  Yeah, I never really bet on golf.  I mean, I watch it because I understand it, and I like... 
[01:57:30]  I mean, I understand football, obviously, since I played in school.  When you play golf, you don't bet, you know, a couple of...  No.  You played football in school?  They had some kind of midget league while you...  Oh, I just wanted to say that.  In your high school?  Everybody grabbed it.  I didn't even go to school.  I raised my hand in English class, go, can I go to the bathroom?  And I never came back, which is quite obviously.  Yeah.  Obvious.  Quite obviously.  I walked out, and I never came back.  I just kept going.  I sold drugs by the heater.  That was my job, was to sell pot by the heater.  There it is. 
[01:58:00]  What?  Oh.  The old...  No, in high school, my hair was a big afro.  Yeah, yeah.  That was toned down.  What do you have on Brett Favre, though, for real, with his father?  No, because what gets me is, like, when people...  Like, when he...  When his dad passed away, and the date of funeral, he goes, I'm going to play today.  You know, that's what my dad would have wanted, you know?  And he had the game of his life.  He threw for, like, 600 yards.  And, you know, who's going to tackle him?  Like, get him.  No, his dad just died.  But, you know, people... 
[01:58:30]  You kind of got to give him the really good game.  Yeah, get him.  No, you know, so...  Especially if it's not the Super Bowl or a big playoff game.  So, he fucking had the game of his life.  And people didn't mind that he played during his dad's funeral.  You know, he's probably a million, two million a day, right?  But the kid from Baskin-Robbins can never say that.  You know, I'm going to work today.  That's what...  Dad loved how I made banana splits, you know?  He was so proud of how I put the whipped cream on.  You know what I mean?  So, it depends on the job you have?  Well, it depends.  Well, if somebody dies, do whatever you like.  That's what I'm saying to the people. 
[01:59:00]  And when someone complains, go, that's what they would have wanted.  That's your excuse.  Like, when Bonnie dies, she's going to want me to fuck everything that walks around.  You know what I mean?  No, we don't.  Explain it.  No.  Well, I...  Uh-oh.  I love when a joke bombs and someone goes, you know what I mean?  Like, all kidding aside, guys.  Well, this all started because somebody that was on Survivor died.  What was her name?  Former Survivor contestant Jennifer Lyon dies at age 37.  And I asked, how did she die?  Sam goes, breast cancer. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  So, I told Rich, you know, breast cancer gives you the opportunity to date young girls.  Because you've got to get over, you know, the sadness one way or the other.  But that's something that...  Oh, God.  Jesus.  And you know they're not going to get it.  Isn't that something that if you check that they can take care of it?  Can't they...  Yeah, breast cancer is...  I mean...  If they detect it early.  As long as the women out there get their boobies squeezed, they're, you know, they should be okay.  Men get it, too.  Early detection.  No, you get it. 
[02:00:00]  Who was...  Who got it?  Peter Criss?  I don't get it.  Bubba Smith, I think, got it.  Peter Criss.  I understand what you said.  The guy on Oz got it?  Which guy?  Which guy?  Well, during the show.  Oh.  O'Reilly.  Yeah, remember when you got...  Did he?  Yeah, on Oz.  Oh, man.  He goes, you can't let the other inmates know because it'll show a sign of weakness.  All right.  Breast cancer, by the way, is not a joke.  I'm checking for lumps.  I'm checking for lumps.  Just stop.  Don't touch yourself.  Why?  Because it's getting me very excited.  Both of my nips are kind of popped up like, hey, who's there? 
[02:00:30]  Are you?  Hootily hoo.  Hootily hoo.  Anyway.  Whoa, my story stunk today.  Oh, it didn't?  No, that was pretty good.  The rod in the tooth.  It's true.  Well, it's very painful, and I can't watch that video.  It's terrible.  Watching your bloody fucking mouth with metal studs in it.  Tooth pain is a motherfucker, man.  Yeah, it really is.  It's right by the brain.  It's like, hello.  So you just keep elbowing your brain.  Hello.  It's right by the brain. 
[02:01:00]  It really is.  The pain signal gets a lickety split.  Any head pain's a bitch.  I had root canal once, and it got infected after it, and the pain was so bad.  I was up crying at night and stuff, and then I went to the dentist, and he took a pliers,  and he squeezed the puss out of my face, and you could feel the fucking pain.  It was almost like anything painful. 
[02:01:30]  Good one.  Can I say there's nothing better than watching a dumbbell grasp for words?  Do that on stage, man.  You'll have plenty of pain.  And you could feel the fucking pain.  Pain was like anything painful.  Anything painful.  He's so rich.  Let's get into this Brock Lesnar thing.  Brock Lesnar's going to be fighting again, which is very exciting news for the UFC, right? 
[02:02:00]  That's great.  And I think we got Brock Lesnar actually talking about this weird illness he had finally.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  It doesn't need a setup.  No, he was on ESPN, and him and Dana White were on making their return announcement.  Cool.  I was devastated just to back out on the fight, and then I decided to take a trip and get away up to Canada and do some hunting.  So I got up there and still didn't feel right.  And one night I woke up, and I was in severe shock. 
[02:02:30]  I had 104 temperature and felt like I was shot in the guts.  And so I went to the hospital in Canada, realized quickly that I had to get out of Canadian health care  and get down to Bismarck, into the United States, where at Med-7-1,  and I kicked my hat off to this doctor there.  They diagnosed me with diverticulitis, and at the time I had diverticulosis,  which at the severe case, I had a rupture of one of my diverticuli, which means I had a hole in my stomach. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, he was a hurting guy, man.  Hole in his stomach?  Yeah.  How else are you going to take a fucking monster like that down?  It's got to be something internal.  Did he get operated on?  How do you close the hole in your stomach?  He explains that in the next clip.  They told him he was going to have to have surgery, but if he had surgery,  he would have probably never been able to fight again, because they would have to take his colon out.  Wow.  A piece of it.  This guy, by the way, this guy's a real American.  He said, fuck Canada. 
[02:03:30]  I don't care.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Sorry to all the Canadians listening today, but Brock Lesnar doesn't like your health system.  Most in-shape man alive doesn't want to be treated by you people.  All right, let's listen to Brock Lesnar continue here.  And so the doctor there put me on antibiotics, put me on pain medication,  and wanted for me to heal myself, versus the other side of it was to go in,  remove part of my colon, and wear a colostomy bag, and pretty much end my career.  That'll win you. 
[02:04:00]  I take my hat off to the doctors there at MedCenter 1 for saving my life and my career.  He waited until the eight-hour mark, was prepared for surgery,  and I started healing myself.  I was in the hospital for 11 days, no food, no water, fed intravenously,  lost 40 pounds, got out of the hospital, went home.  And he could still kick any one of our asses.  I was just thinking that.  He could still kick any one, fresh out of the hospital, still destroy us, I bet. 
[02:04:30]  Jesus.  That colostomy bag would have made a great fucking defense in the ring, though.  Well, he would have had to move back to wrestling if he was going to be using that, you know.  He would have been welcomed with open arms.  Of course.  Like, what's his name?  Mr. Fuji?  What was his name?  Yeah, instead of throwing salt.  Instead of throwing salt, he would throw contents of his bag in the apartment's face.  When we went home, my answer was I have to have surgery, and I didn't want to. 
[02:05:00]  If I could beat the odds, I was going to do everything in my power to do that.  And so I had another checkup after the first of the year.  I went home.  I went back in the gym.  I got my weight back up.  I put about 30 pounds back on.  Went back into the doctor January 5th.  And a miracle.  They were dumbfounded.  They couldn't find any signs of any problem in my stomach.  It's just a miracle to me. 
[02:05:30]  What's going on?  It was a miracle.  He healed himself.  How do you get a hole in your stomach to begin with?  Steroids.  Whatever he had, he probably...  I'm guessing he's just got probably a great immune system, and he's an athlete, man.  A lot of times, athletes, you're in peak condition.  I mean, your body works.  Get Dr. Steve on the phone, because...  Oh, shit.  Can you heal yourself when you have a hole in your stomach?  If you're Brock Lesnar, you can.  I'm a little confused, for real.  I'm not just taking his words through this.  Something seems a little off. 
[02:06:00]  Maybe he was misdiagnosed to begin with.  Maybe it was like an ulcer or something.  Maybe he swallowed that stuff you put in your radiator when it leaks.  Or he should have said, fix the flat.  You're rad.  You know that?  Fix the flat.  Wow.  You're rad, bro.  He changed his diet and ate exactly what he was supposed to.  No more thumbtacks?  Why?  And what?  The hole says, oh, wow.  Oh, this food's good.  I'm going to close this hole.  It healed itself.  Why would they have had to take out part of his colon to fix the hole in his stomach? 
[02:06:30]  This is all doctor questions.  I'm not a doctor.  Everybody's looking at Robert.  Let's get the third clip on.  I'm going to call bitch-ass Dr. Steve.  Can you call Dr. Steve?  Yeah, we're working on that right now.  And we've got other people calling in that might be doctors to explain further.  Because I don't know.  I need more of an explanation here.  Do you want to be clear?  You are still the UFC heavyweight champion.  Yeah, let's be clear with that.  I still am the UFC heavyweight champion.  Exactly.  And I want to leave it to Dana.  Dana, he is still the champion.  So the title defense will be his. 
[02:07:00]  When will we see Brock Lesnar back in the ring doing just that?  Because he's been out so long and we were so unsure on what was going to happen.  We have a fight in Newark, New Jersey on March 27th.  And undefeated Shane Carwin is going to fight the former heavyweight champion, Frank Mir.  The winner of that fight will be the interim champion.  And we'll face Brock Lesnar, you know, this summer.  This summer.  So he's back.  Yeah, he needs time to heal.  Yeah.  Still, I'm sure.  Frank Mir wants no fucking part of fighting Brock Lesnar again. 
[02:07:30]  Just lose for a third time.  Dude.  Well, he only lost.  Oh, that's right.  He's one and one with him.  I wonder, as much as I love Fedor and I think that he's an amazing.  Fedor, we forgot about him already.  I wonder if his people were scared of Brock.  Yeah.  I really do.  I mean, again, there's a whole money making thing, too.  Like, they make a shitload of probably more money than they would with UFC because they  get a bigger fight.  No, let's talk about Fedor.  Well, he hasn't fought.  He fought once.  No, I understand that.  Brett Rogers was a great fight.  Yeah, but then he just went away.  He's fighting soon, I think. 
[02:08:00]  He fought on free TV.  And why don't we have Dana White on anymore?  He was going to come in, but he didn't.  Too big.  No, Dana was big.  I want Dana on the phone today.  He can explain this further for us.  I stopped myself.  Answer me.  I stopped myself.  I know you did, but it was funny to hear you start.  Oh, this guy has the same disease that Brock has.  Let's go to Tony.  What?  Tony.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, yeah.  Hey, how you doing over there?  No, I got the same disease he's got.  I've had Crohn's disease, and yeah, it's possible to heal yourself from the inside out. 
[02:08:30]  Hmm.  But did he have Crohn's?  Yeah, I have Crohn's.  It's the same thing.  It's the same animal.  Okay.  But I'm confused because they're saying they would have to remove his colon, and he said,  fuck that, and then the next thing you know, he heals himself.  There's a big gap there.  Well, what it is is that they tell you, the doctor will go in, and we go in and see the doctor.  He says, okay, no more eating this and that and the other thing.  You actually have to adhere to a strict regimen, just like being on a diet.  Yeah.  But the difference is that you can't eat, like, whole wheat bread or, you know, 
[02:09:00]  roughage and stuff like that.  You work around it.  You can't heal yourself if you stick to the diet and they put you on a med.  It's like, I'm on a med now, but I only take once a month.  Before that, at my worst point, I was taking 36 pills a day.  What can't you eat besides bread or anything with little things in it?  Can we slow down again, Tony?  Tony, I hear what you're saying, but Brock Lesnar probably eats pretty well to begin with.  Oh, hell yeah.  He eats a hell of a lot better than any of us.  Right.  So now you're telling me he had to eat better than how he was eating? 
[02:09:30]  Well, no.  He probably ate perfect.  He had to eat his diet.  They told him.  Yeah.  You know, and that's what it is.  Like, I'm not allowed.  Like, I can't eat vegetables.  I mean, the only way I can eat a vegetable is it has to be boiled down to nothing where there's  no nutrients there.  And at that point, what the hell is the point of eating it?  You don't want fucked vegetables.  Who needs them?  Oh, come on, man.  It's not their fault.  But, I mean, it's like, even if you go out to eat, you've got to be careful.  It's not like you can just go to Mickey D's and grab a burger or nothing.  Mickey D's. 
[02:10:00]  Shut up.  Mickey D's.  Are you wearing Capizios?  Well, you know what I mean.  Sorry.  Damn that.  But Anthony, what made me laugh was Anthony's just complete and real disgust over nothing.  It was like, you'd think the guy said that all pregnant women should be fucking thrown  down the steps.  All right.  But it was Mickey D's.  And just the way Anthony looked up, like, what a piece of shit this guy is.  Mickey D's.  Dr. Steve's on the line, and he had to research this before he called our show, so this should 
[02:10:30]  work out.  Dr. Steve.  Jesus.  Dr. Steve.  Hello, my love.  Did you do what we could do and just Google this shit?  No.  What?  No, I needed to get in.  I was on my cell phone, and I need to get to a landline.  Oh, okay.  All right, good.  All right.  What do you got on this, Dr. Steve?  Now, Brock Lesnar, I don't know if you were listening, basically said he had a hole in  his stomach.  He had...  Dieticliitis?  Diverticulitis.  Yeah.  The worst form of that, though. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And then, all right.  So then he had a hole in his stomach, and the doctor suggested that he gets operated  on and has his colon removed, which would end his fighting career, obviously, and would  make his life a living hell.  He said, fuck that, and he healed himself.  Is this possible?  Yeah.  Well, let's talk a little bit about what diverticulitis is first.  It wasn't in his stomach.  It was in his large intestine.  And...  It goes from drinking Dr. Steve's wine.  Well... 
[02:11:30]  The lining of the colon is like...  Do you remember in the old days when we had our bicycle tires, and they had an inner  tube in them?  Ah, yes.  And if the outer hard, you know, sort of hard rubbery layer splits, the inner elastic layer  would sort of balloon out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Well, the intestine is like that.  It's got a sort of fibrous outer layer and then an elastic inner layer. 
[02:12:00]  And when that fibrous outer layer splits, you can get this ballooning out.  And you make these little pockets, and those are called diverticulae.  And all those diverticulae, it comes from our terrible American diet where we don't eat  enough fiber and stuff.  And so these huge pressures in the colon force these balloons out.  And so you can get an intestine that's sort of pocketed with all these little balloons.  Well, if you get something caught in one of those that won't flush itself out, it can just sit 
[02:12:30]  there and fester, and it gets infected.  Oh, my God.  Are these things that can be seen during a colonoscopy?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Absolutely.  And Steve, what gets caught like that?  Is that why he can't eat multigrain bread, those little things?  Probably stuff that is hard to digest to begin with, right?  Right.  The typical diverticulitis diet is no seeds, no nuts.  Now, there are GI guys now that say that's horse shit, that you can still eat the seeds 
[02:13:00]  and nuts.  You just need to increase the fiber in your diet.  But that's the traditional thing, is that you get a seed or a nut that just won't digest  and it just lays there.  And then, obviously, bacteria just sort of wall around it and then cause it.  Rich, why don't you go take a break?  This is Josh fucking...  Yeah, Rich gets nervous.  Now Rich thinks he has this.  What prevents this from happening?  Don't eat seeds or nuts.  No, but what else?  I eat a lot of nuts.  Well, they usually just bounce in your chin.  The advantage of the one thing is high-fiber diet.  We need to eat what we were designed to eat, which is high-fiber stuff. 
[02:13:30]  And if you can't do it with a fast-food diet, then you need to supplement your diet with fiber,  like inulin, which is in that fiber choice.  Or my favorite is Citrusel.  It's methylcellulose.  It's the stuff they made slime out of in Ghostbusters 2.  Citrusel, okay.  But it's methylcellulose.  It doesn't cause bloating, and it's not digested by the bacteria in your stomach, 
[02:14:00]  and so it just goes straight through, and it's an awesome fiber supplement.  So what else is fiber?  What's food's habit?  I don't know if I eat it enough.  Well, you know, fresh fruits and vegetables, dude.  I eat a lot of vegetables and a lot of fruits.  No, you don't.  Hopey, they call me the fruit and veggie kid by building.  Steve, but you're missing one thing.  He said that he had a hole in his stomach.  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm sure his concept of anatomy is not.  A little off?  So you're saying he didn't have a hole in his stomach.  No, if he had diverticulitis, he had a hole in his intestine. 
[02:14:30]  He said in his stomach, though, didn't he?  He said in his stomach.  Okay, I'm just making sure.  All right.  Okay, and he had an abscess, from what I understand,  and they had to actually drain it at one point,  and that's why normally when that happens,  when you get a big collection of pus and it has to be drained,  that it's just not going to heal,  and that's why they told him he needed surgery.  And apparently he's just one of the lucky guys  that was able to heal it without surgery.  Now, he's prone to have this happen again. 
[02:15:00]  That's the problem.  Wow.  But isn't this something that you don't know it's coming on you  until it's there?  Right.  Yeah, unless you've had a colonoscopy or a contrast study.  The other thing this diverticulitis will do is,  since they're real thin-walled, they'll bleed,  and so some people will have bright red blood coming on you.  Oh, God.  What is something you can do?  I'm all nauseous.  We're all, like, paranoid here.  I'm getting all woozy.  Oh, my God.  What is something you can do?  Is there a company or something where you can go in 
[02:15:30]  and from head to toe get scanned and get, like,  all the blood work and just get pretty much tested?  Dr. McCoy, he'll fucking run a salt shaker over you.  Insurance wouldn't cover it, but, I mean, what?  Actually, there are these things.  They're called, quote, unquote, executive physicals.  Okay.  Executive Jerry.  And you can go and pay money and have all this done.  Now, let me warn you that there are certain screening tests  that don't make sense to do on everybody,  and your chance of having a false positive is higher the more tests that you do. 
[02:16:00]  So that's why we don't recommend that for everybody.  You know, if you're 50, you need a colonoscopy.  If you had somebody in your family that had colon cancer,  you need to get your colonoscopy done 10 years before they had theirs.  So, like, if somebody in your family, a first-degree relative, had colon cancer at 45,  you need to get your colonoscopy at 35.  Other than that, you probably don't need one.  I have a question.  I just married into the family. 
[02:16:30]  How about, are those colon cleaners that they advertise, are those...  Tongues?  You know, that cock with a rag tape to them.  You know what I mean, that you're supposed to clean out the walls of your colon and all that.  Are those both, Bull?  Kind of.  I mean, they do work as a laxative, and so they'll clean out your colon.  The issue is, is there 10 pounds of fecal matter impacted on the walls of the colon? 
[02:17:00]  And anybody that's ever done a colonoscopy knows that that's not true,  because you just take the prep, you go in, and you shove this tube up there,  and you look around, and there's nothing there.  It's just beautiful pink, you know, intestinal...  Asshole.  Beautiful pink ass.  Hey, Dr. Steve, I've got to ask you something.  Did Brock Lesnar's shit smell just horrendous?  Oh, you know it had to.  With that festering fucking pus and...  I mean, it probably didn't smell good in the first place. 
[02:17:30]  How bad did his duty smell?  A gallon of pus to it.  How bad did it smell?  Come on, let's get into this.  How bad could a duty smell?  Oh, it can be one of the...  We've all had that horrendous fucking shit.  I always have them.  You're so embarrassed, and you're by yourself.  But how bad could it really get?  Yeah, but, well, infection can...  I mean, that's the...  Infected pus is one of the worst smells that there is.  I've got to get E-rocked it.  How do we get E-rocked to smell it?  Well, you smelled Voss's ear back when he had the cyst, right? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  We all took a sniff of that over the years.  That is kind of what...  Multiply that times 100, and that's what...  How do we get this done, guys?  ...the smell is like.  Well, I saw...  I had the cyst in one ear.  Right.  Now, the other ear...  Voss has always had...  Oh, sorry.  Voss has always...  I was just trying to make a point.  I accidentally poked Rich's penis.  Voss has always had that.  Do you still have some today?  Don't do it now.  No, probably not.  I don't know.  Maybe if I...  I thought you had that removed.  I had one side removed. 
[02:18:30]  I might have had both.  No, I had one side removed, and I haven't gone to get the other sack taken out yet.  Okay.  Amy's...  The sack.  Amy's AIDS.  I got so much...  Oh, Amy's AIDS.  She's...  Oh.  Amy Fisher says Amy's AIDS.  She's got a little coverage.  A little press coverage there.  Yeah, she should.  She's doing a good thing.  She really...  She's taking her clothes off.  I had stomach problems, and they have me on methoscopeline or something.  Do you know what that is?  Metoclopramide?  No, methoscop...  Every word he can... 
[02:19:00]  Every time he tries to pronounce it, it's going to go up on the wall.  Try it again.  Try it again.  This is so hard.  Methoscopeline.  Methoscopeline?  I'm off it, but it...  Was that for your bad breath?  No, it was for my stomach.  That was for my...  For a while there, it felt like I had hunger pains forever.  I've got to explain it.  And the only thing that worked on my stomach was, like, to eat something.  The guy from Bayshore says Voss was on Stupitol.  Stupitol.  Methoscopeline.  Yes, yes. 
[02:19:30]  Methoscopeline.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, that's what they call an anticholinergic drug.  It stops spasms of the stomach and bowel.  How long does a colonoscopy take?  You have to be knocked out for it, right?  No, you don't have to be knocked out for it.  I did my last one without anesthesia at all.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Talking to the doctor and chuckling.  You're a weirdo.  Yeah.  Chuckling.  Hence, weird medicine.  You're a weirdo.  You probably get on yourself in the car.  The thing is, is that the anesthesia messes me up for a couple of days, and so I did it 
[02:20:00]  without anesthesia.  Oh, and your shitty wine does it?  I just pulled up my drawers and went back to work.  How long did it take to do?  Um, 15 minutes.  15 minutes with a tube snaking through your intestines?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and it was bad because, you know, I was awake and the guy got to the last curve of  the intestine.  And so, you know, it takes a couple of right turns, and he couldn't get it to advance.  And so he said, well, this is going to hurt. 
[02:20:30]  And he took that tube and just started shoving, shoving, shoving, you know, foot after foot.  Oh, my God.  You could feel it coiling around in my colon until it finally gave way and then, you know,  finished the journey.  It was really bad.  How many feet can your anus take?  Um, that tube is about four feet.  Wow.  Congratulations.  Were you scared that you were going to have an orgasm?  Four feet.  Jesus.  These are ass.  Thank you, my friend.  So I got, I want to get one of those.  Four feet.  You never had a colonoscopy? 
[02:21:00]  I'm 41.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rich, you're a lot older than us.  You forget sometimes.  Yeah.  Unless you have a specific colon problem, Jim, you don't need one yet.  I just want to do it because, I mean, I might as well.  I want to get an executive physical.  I'll go in my suit.  Well, email me later.  I'll get you a place that does it.  All right.  I want to bring my briefcase and be a real gentleman, wear my fedora.  That's the way to take the same joke and try to do it twice.  It never works.  Dr. Steve, take us to break.  We've got Rich Vossen here. 
[02:21:30]  He's playing Comedy Zone tomorrow and Saturday at, yeah, Comedy Zone in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Take us to break.  Oh, wait.  I'm not going to hang up on you.  No, that's okay.  I'm going to ask Rich something real quick.  All righty.  What's even better is I didn't go what?  No, he didn't get me because I didn't go what?  He got me.  I said, you fuck.  It's not always about you.  Yeah, it's not about you, Richard.  Never about him.  Oh, that was a good throw.  And there's a guy there.  It hurt you?  No.  There's a guy there asking on the feedback about my D.C. show, my Virginia show at the 
[02:22:00]  State Theater is sold out tomorrow.  Wait, wait.  Where, Jimmy?  I'm trying to look and find that.  The third one down.  Third one down.  The second show goes on sale tomorrow.  Wait, wait.  The third one down for real?  It says, Jimmy sucks Jay Leno's cock.  Well, wait.  Are you sure it was the third one down?  Did it say that?  He's talking about no one could say that.  From J.L. in L.A.  The third one down, really?  All right.  Yeah, because people ask me about my State Theater show. 
[02:22:30]  It's sold out very quickly.  It's a late show that night.  I don't remember the date.  When is that?  God damn it.  I'm so stupid.  All right.  After the break, you'll have it all figured out.  Oh, I got it.  Here I go.  You got it?  It's March 6th.  The 8 p.m. is sold out.  The 10.30 goes on sale tomorrow at thestatetheater.com.  Theater is R-E.  You know, like the British.  Just spell it right.  Yeah.  I'm very popular in Virginia.  All right.  Remarkably, embarrassingly so.  Go be back. 
[02:23:00]  Rich Voss in studio.  Doing a good job.  Comedy Zone Harrisburg tomorrow and Saturday night.  What's up with this Saudi teen with a cell phone in school?  She's getting what she deserves.  Those Saudis know how to dish out the justice.  Meeting out punishment.  That's right.  Girl had a cell phone in school.  She got what she deserved.  Atta boy.  What did they do?  Suspend her?  They just took her phone away.  That's all.  Took her phone away.  And called her mommy.  And that was it.  Called the family.  And she's suspended. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Anything else?  Oh, yeah.  And they gave her 90 lashes and two months in prison.  How old is she?  How old is she?  She's 13.  13.  Those fucking animals.  And you know what?  I try to have an open mind.  We're supposed to get along with the rest of the world, really.  Really?  I just think we can relate to this.  But it's amazing that we infringe our will on some countries, what they can do and what  they can't do.  And yet the Saudis, they are just fucking savages.  She's actually happy. 
[02:24:00]  And we suck their dicks.  She gets to keep her clit, which is a plus.  What gets me is a 13-year-old has a cell phone.  How young do they get them?  Oh, jeez.  That wasn't bad.  Why?  It wasn't bad compared to what?  What are you talking about, Rich?  Yeah.  How would a 13-year-old has a cell phone?  That was a joke.  Not that she's getting her fucking...  What's the joke from what?  1990?  What's the joke about that, though?  Like every kid has a cell phone.  Yeah.  Oh, you're right.  I'm old-fashioned.  My 11-year-old nephew has a cell phone.  And he got one. 
[02:24:30]  And he got one late.  My six-year-old girlfriend has one.  My sister finally gave in.  But, you know, they're getting them at 9, 8.  I see little fuckers walking around Manhattan with cell phones.  All right.  It didn't fucking work.  Don't dissect every fucking thing that doesn't work.  Then we'd be here all day.  That's true.  Jayster's got a little more info on the story over here saying,  wow, this is harsh.  I could see the lashings and everything.  They forced her to get AT&T.  Wow.  It's funny.  They couldn't identify it as a phone first because she had AT&T. 
[02:25:00]  They're like, it's make no call.  Oh, almost.  They thought it was a camera.  No, we're Arab.  I am Saudi Jimmy.  Saudi Jimmy.  Give me the oil.  And I'll give it to you for a barrel of something.  And they're going to flog her in front of her classmates.  So some of the classmates are going to have boners.  And then that's going to cause a new problem.  I don't think you're allowed to have a boner in class.  Yeah, not unless you're looking to get a young boy over there.  A bunch of fucking closeted homos. 
[02:25:30]  We're going to give the girl a flogging.  Work on it.  Everybody line up for flogging.  It's happening soon.  That's Caribbean, Jimmy.  No, it's not.  No, there's a difference.  That's not Saudi Jimmy.  No, there's a difference.  You can hear it.  Oh, yeah.  You can hear it.  Saudi Jimmy does this.  They're going to flog her.  All right.  What, Rich?  Did you see The Hurt Locker? 
[02:26:00]  I haven't seen that yet.  I want to see it.  I hear the movie's amazing.  It was very good.  I hear it's amazing.  You can't get any more realistic.  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, you can.  You can go over there.  I was going to say without going over there, you know, how we just go into other countries,  and I'm far from a bleeding heart, but can you imagine if a country just came over here  to tell us how to run our shit?  Their ass is kicked.  I mean, yeah, just, I mean, they'd get a kick in the fanny.  Look, if we were pulling hijinks and shenanigans, then perhaps. 
[02:26:30]  We are corporately, throughout the world, corporately.  All right, Matt.  Well, Matt.  All right, Rich Voss.  We fucking rape fucking third world countries on the resources.  All right.  Okay.  You know, we go in, we take over.  We fucking, uh...  No, you think I'm like that, but it's a fucking bare fact that we go in and fucking rape them.  We give them loans they can't pay back.  Yeah, look how old we are.  Look at our fucking Black Hawk helicopters landing in Haiti and giving more aid than anyone 
[02:27:00]  on the planet.  Shut up.  So was Israel.  Do people talk about Israel going into Haiti and fucking with...  No, what, huh?  I'm just saying everybody went to fucking Haiti.  So it's got to come back to you being a Jew.  No, no, everybody went to fucking Haiti.  Yeah, yeah.  Even fucking middle...  Even Arabs went there to help them.  But we fucking are the ones that do all the work.  We're in there now as the fucking, like, facto government.  And security, so the savages aren't cutting each other apart with fucking machetes.  Listen, just because we do something good doesn't give us the right to do something fucked  up, too, does it? 
[02:27:30]  Sometimes we got to do fucked up shit to keep people from fucking shit up.  That's how this country's world works.  Listen...  If it's in our best interest, we'll do it.  Please, it has nothing to do with policy anymore.  It's all fucking corporations.  It's all fucking money.  Talk about Israel.  That's what they do for their self-interest.  They're not going in.  They fucking keep moving their borders a little wider, a little wider, and taking away Palestinian  fucking lands.  And how much land did they give back after they were trying to...  They didn't have any before fucking 47, so what the fuck?  They've been here for 2,000 fucking years. 
[02:28:00]  It just wasn't confirmed as a state.  Just like everyone else, walking around with no borders.  Okay, so what gives us the right to say that we're fucking Americans?  Because we said we were.  We were here.  That's how shit works in the globe.  Some people have.  Okay, and that's how it worked in Israel.  And some people don't.  And that's how it worked in Israel.  No, they were there, and they said, this is our land.  We do shit, too, like that.  So unless you're ready to fucking shit on your motherland over there, leave America alone.  Why don't you go over there?  Plant a tree, you Jew.  I planted one.  I planted one. 
[02:28:30]  Did you?  Three in my kids' names.  I had three trees.  The only ones in that fucking desert are my kids' trees.  Really?  In fucking Israel, yes.  A Palestinian cuts it down.  Good, good.  And they weren't even Palestinians before the Sixth Day War.  They were Jordanians.  Okay.  All of a sudden, it's a new thing.  Oh, there wasn't anything called Palestine before then?  There was nothing called Palestine?  No.  I think there was a Palestine before there was an Israel.  Before there was a Bible.  Yeah.  First of all, Jews took that land just like we took this fucking land.  Okay?  Well, no.  Okay.  No, they were kind of given that. 
[02:29:00]  Jews were kind of given Israel.  No, but they were there forever.  They were given, no.  After they were chased out of every country in fucking Europe, after they made everybody  rich.  They should have been troublemakers.  After they, oh, really?  They were troublemakers making everybody fucking rich throughout the world?  Oh, let's use them as accountants, lawyers, and doctors.  Wait, we're done with them.  Get out.  And they take their shit.  All right?  So, don't say they were fucking, they were, uh, what did you say?  I didn't say anything.  I don't know.  I don't forget it.  I'm just trying to get too angry.  I don't believe in anything I say on this show.  It's just, it's, it's fucking beautiful. 
[02:29:30]  Dude, why even defend in Israel?  Like, they do the same shit that we do.  They have been really dirty with the Palestinians.  Yes.  But, I agree with you.  But no one's blowing up our buses either.  I agree with what you're saying about America.  I think you're right.  No one's blowing up our buses.  I think that we're very selective.  I've had enough of us.  We shouldn't send a fucking military to Haiti.  We should donate money.  And then let them do what the fuck they want to do.  Mind our business.  The whole world.  Everywhere.  Well, the whole world is helping in disasters.  Yeah, but we have to be.  Help, yes.  We have to be the big guys that go in there and set up, like I said. 
[02:30:00]  No, that's only the propaganda here.  How do we know how much fucking England's doing?  That's our American propaganda saying we're the big guys over there.  We are.  How do you know fucking England doesn't have rescue troops?  Because France said that we're occupying Haiti because we're sending our military.  Yeah, we sent military there.  We sent all kinds of supplies and financial aid more so than any other country.  It's all.  It's all.  They pretty much know.  They say they go.  They go.  We are donating such and such amount of money.  And we have said we donating more money than anybody else. 
[02:30:30]  That's that's what we do.  So we when we go around like that, we're fucking great guys.  And we still get shit on, by the way.  And then when we go around the world and try to, you know, sweep up some some shit.  Guys like Rich Voss got to chime in.  It's all about corporations, man.  No, I'm not saying that we're trying to clean up shit.  I'm not saying we're trying to go in and liberize people.  Liberize.  I said liberize.  Hit the fucking world with that one.  Y'all want it to be like Liberace?  Hit the world.  I want a nation. 
[02:31:00]  You want a nation of Liberace.  Sam, please cancel in Liberace.  We want people to learn how to play piano throughout the world.  Yes.  OK.  When we go into liberal.  Wow.  Liberate.  When we go into liberate.  Wow.  It's not the same as going in and.  Shut up.  There's no way to make a point after liberize.  Liberize.  Oh, God, I love it.  OK.  So I'm not saying.  So what is America doing wrong there, Rich?  Yeah.  What are we doing?  What are we doing wrong? 
[02:31:30]  That's all corporate.  Give Rich the fucking.  Give him the stage.  I think.  What is America doing wrong?  Uh, what I think and just part of what I think.  I have a problem with that right there.  Everybody's all bent, bent on, uh, uh, Democrat, Republican, this and that.  And it's all bullshit because they're just fucking, they're just speakers for bigger and  much, much bigger money behind them.  That's all.  They're all, they're just spokesmen.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  OK.  I can agree with that.  You know, so basically, uh, it doesn't matter what the fuck.  They say are who you vote for because the decisions are a lot bigger.  What about what happened in Massachusetts?  Well, OK, so this person, this person is, is now in the Senate, a Republican.  Big deal.  It goes away.  It goes way.  Shut down.  With the health care bill.  The health care bill that's, that's, uh, uh, proposed right now where they are now  going to have to revamp this whole fucking thing from one guy getting in there. 
[02:32:30]  They would have had a revamp in a hand because the whole bill.  Didn't that?  No, they wouldn't.  It's bigger.  They got the majority, the super majority, the president's size, it's over, John.  Well, also, I watched a movie the other night that explained all this.  What?  What, Hurt Locker?  No, it's, uh, it's on YouTube.  Precious?  Precious.  What did Precious tell you about the world economy?  I need to know.  You knew Voss watched something online.  I know.  No, it was a, it was a good movie.  Look, we're all guilty of doing it.  Zeitgeist or Zeit something. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, one of those propaganda things.  Oh, no.  You fucking idiot.  Don't.  I should have known.  I should have known the way he was spouting off.  Zeitgeist.  Is that, yeah.  Did you watch it?  No.  Why?  It was good.  It was, it was free.  It was free.  Well, that should tell you something.  Oh, no.  Zeitgeist.  Is that what it was?  It was that fucking propaganda.  We've all done it, though.  You watch CNN for a half hour and think you know everything.  You know, I mean, that's kind of, I had some valid points. 
[02:33:30]  What I'm saying is.  Yes, you're right.  They do.  I'm sure they do.  And I had some valid points.  I just wanted to say.  You said liberize.  You were moved and liberize.  Sometimes I get caught up and I get too.  Stupid.  You know, over, over, over dumb.  You know, I just get too, too crazy.  And fucking Israel won that fucking land in Egypt  during the Six-Day War and gave it back.  Have we ever given back land?  They gave back land that they took in Egypt.  So, for the peace treaty to be signed. 
[02:34:00]  And Carter put together this fucking thing.  Okay, we'll fucking supply Israel with, what do you call it,  with weapons and whatever.  If you give back the land.  No country gives back land after they take it in war.  Really?  Yeah.  Name some.  Name some.  Name some.  Kuwait.  Really?  Iraq gave it back.  We forced Iraq to give it back.  They didn't give it back.  Look at Germany.  They were forced.  Who gives it back out of goodwill? 
[02:34:30]  They're all forced to give it back.  Israel gave it back out of goodwill.  I think we owned Montreal for a while.  We gave back fucking Japan.  They were a conquered nation.  And we actually, instead of divvying it up and making it USA fucking West,  we decided, hey.  Oh, we gave it back to fucking leveled land that we fucking bombed.  Really?  We don't want this.  You clean it up.  We could have made a great fucking place out of it.  Look, they did.  We did make a great place out of it. 
[02:35:00]  That's right, man.  We did give Japan back.  The Marshall Plan.  We didn't take it.  We didn't rebuild after we win wars.  We rebuild everybody's fucking shit back.  We didn't go into fucking Japan and take over.  We dropped bombs on them.  Okay, we didn't go in.  It was called an unconditional surrender.  We won the fucking war.  Yeah, but we didn't go in.  What do you think happened in Germany?  Between the Soviets and the Allies.  Well, I'm just going to stop here because you're a little more smarter on this.  All I'm saying is.  They divvied up the fucking, they divvied up Germany into East and West Germany. 
[02:35:30]  Who?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The Koreans.  The Koreans.  Oh, my God.  Israel gave back land.  No country does it.  Yeah, they did.  The U.S. did it.  Rich was right.  No, we didn't go in and take the land.  We didn't have to go in.  We had bombs.  However you get it, you get it.  You were in a war.  Yeah, it's a war we won.  You were in a war.  You weren't in a war to take their fucking land. 
[02:36:00]  You were defending.  Israel was defending itself.  Playing in golf.  Come on, playing in golf.  Tough guy.  Take my ass, right?  Let's say hi to Allen in North Carolina.  Allen.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hi, Allen.  Hey, Rich.  United States has given back land.  It's now called the Indian Reservation.  I thought of that, too, but we were like, you know.  Really?  It's still U.S. problem.  Hold on.  Someone else has one.  Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, we won the Philippines during the Spanish-American War. 
[02:36:30]  We gave the whole country back.  Yeah.  Wow.  We gave the fucking Panama Canal back.  I missed that fucking week of school, the whole Philippine thing.  Well, now, okay, so America, okay.  Well, that's not taking away that Israel gave back the land in Egypt.  Did they?  Okay, so.  What point were you trying to make in the first place?  The Palestinians could have went there.  That's where they could have been.  Oh, really?  That's where they.  Well, also, too, when after six countries try to extinguish you and they lose.  Or exterminate. 
[02:37:00]  Exterminate, extinguish.  Same thing.  They were on fire.  He put them out.  Exterminate.  Then they were bugs.  Yeah.  Are you saying that?  So, both words mean the same.  All right.  It's an oxymoron.  It certainly is.  Yes.  No, that's not the word.  It's an oxy.  Without the oxy part.  The right to return that the Palestinians wanted was something that held up the peace  treaty, too, because the Israelis, by allowing a right to return, would have meant that the  Jews would have been outnumbered by Palestinians in Jerusalem and Israel. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  And when Clinton tried to sign a peace treaty between Israel and Palestine, Arafat.  They were too busy.  Sit down, fucking a girl.  I get it.  You know, Arafat, we want Jerusalem.  Really?  It's like, yeah, we're going to give fucking Russia D.C.  It's fucking ridiculous, because it knew it would cause conflict against Israel.  They knew.  Arafat knew.  Jews and Palestinians both consider Jerusalem a holy land, and they want it shared, because  you guys get along so well together, you can share. 
[02:38:00]  Sharing is caring.  It's my part of the wall.  Hey, we had Obama on the old TV yesterday, talking about this election in Massachusetts.  Obama.  What do you think of Obama's first year, Rich?  We were discussing that yesterday, trying to figure out what he did in the first year  of his presidency.  Man.  What do you think Obama did in the first year of his presidency?  Played golf in Hawaii.  Good.  That did happen.  He had a beer.  We did that one.  He fucking bailed out criminals.  He bailed out fucking banks and mortgage companies. 
[02:38:30]  My fucking bank called me and said, your money, the guy said, do you want to roll over  your CD?  I go, what's the interest?  He said, a half a percent.  Oh, that piece of shit.  I said, really, you're going to fucking, you're not embarrassed to make this call?  You'll charge.  I said, really?  I said that to him.  I go, how could you not be embarrassed?  You'll charge six and seven percent on a fucking loan, but give a half a percent back.  I go, you know what?  I'm taking my fuck, all my money out of there.  I'm just going to take it out and put it in a fucking safe.  You know, I'm $20,000, whatever, but I'm how, you know, it's ridiculous that we bail 
[02:39:00]  out these scumbags and they're making fucking millions of dollars in bonuses and giving  shit back to the fucking people.  It is.  You know, cash for clunkers.  Go fuck yourself.  Wow.  Wow.  It's just another way to get you in to buy a car.  Big deal.  It's a trade in.  Hey, we've had trade ins for years.  It's pretty much.  It's a trade in.  Yeah.  Okay.  All it is.  Well, that was Obama's.  Now they're doing it with appliances, really?  Oh, really?  You can do it with appliances?  They're doing it with refrigerators or whatever. 
[02:39:30]  They want better, yeah, yeah.  More economical air conditioning.  That whole green shit is bullshit, too.  Yes, it is.  Just fucking solar heating companies and all these companies that are brainwashing you  to go buy their fucking green products.  Go fuck yourself.  I keep my lights on all night long.  Drive past a factory.  Drive down to Jersey Turnpike and look at all the smoke and all the pollution and all that  garbage coming out.  Really?  My light bulb is going to make a fucking difference?  Really?  Go fuck yourself.  Not the one over your head.  Okay?  Brainwashing. 
[02:40:00]  When he comes in, this one's done.  It's fucking ridiculous.  That's what he did.  There's still a lot of smoke coming out of those smokestacks, though.  He makes a good point.  It's all bullshit.  I'm doing my part.  All the big guys doing that.  Gary, my fucking little circle light bulb is really going to make a difference.  My little screwing light bulb.  Fuck you.  Every time you drive that part of the New Jersey Turnpike, you always ask whoever's in the car,  did you fart?  No.  I didn't fart.  It's this fucking area.  I hate having me.  There's so much pollution over there.  It doesn't matter.  Nick Carman joke. 
[02:40:30]  Everyone knows.  The thing is, everyone knows that Liz around here.  Everyone knows that.  But when you have somebody out of town, that's when it does get embarrassing.  And you've got to do that while you're driving.  You've got to go, ah, the Jersey, the smell, you know.  They always ask.  They don't know.  They always ask that someone fart.  Every fucking time.  It's between, I don't know now, Newark Airport and Manhattan.  I was in, I guess, I think it was Kalamazoo, whatever the Pfizer plant is.  Yes.  Right, third fact.  It's probably a mile long.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:41:00]  Right?  Really?  Really?  There's no pollution?  There's no fucking light?  It's just...  That isn't even the case.  Look at emerging nations like China and India who are still using technology that we stopped  using decades ago.  The 70s or so, right?  And, like, we used to just pump out unfiltered waste into the atmosphere.  And we cleaned up, and they're not.  So now what?  Like you said, we've got to put in the little curly Q fluorescent light bulbs while they're  just pumping coal out of their fucking stacks. 
[02:41:30]  We do forget about the cars and what was coming out of the cars just driving down the road.  The cars now put out less waste.  That was just all smoke coming out of the fucking tailpipes, remember?  An eight-cylinder car now puts out a lot less than a four-cylinder car did in the 70s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We are making some...  We're making headway.  Yeah.  But that's why I run two fucking pool heaters.  Yeah.  I keep my pool warm.  I could give a shit.  We're making headway, but we'll lose in the end.  Well, how are we going to...  And then Earth will do its thing, and it'll be fine. 
[02:42:00]  It's natural.  Earth will be fine.  We're not going to be fine.  That's how that works.  We're part of what happens...  I've said this before.  Part of what happens on this planet.  When they say, oh, we're destroying the planet, we're fucking doing what animals do.  You know, some animals go, and they overgraze on some shit, and then they wind up fucking  dying because they starve.  And then a few of the other ones know to move, and they go somewhere else.  We're just animals that have figured out how to take some resources, mix them together,  and make shit fly. 
[02:42:30]  You know?  So that's it.  But you know what?  It's all part of nature.  We're doing exactly what we're supposed to do here.  That's all.  Fix it later.  You know what?  Fix it down the fucking line.  I'm doing what I do with what resources I have here.  We have gasoline for cars.  That's what I'm going to use.  And when the gasoline runs out, or it turns out that the air is getting so polluted from  it, someone down the line, a few generations, will figure something out to make it work.  Or they won't.  That's me. 
[02:43:00]  Don't inconvenience me for our limitations now.  Because we don't have fucking cold fusion.  I've got to sit here and not drive a fucking Escalade?  Blow me.  That's what I say.  Good point.  Don't inconvenience me.  It's all just for them to make it.  It's a scam to make money.  I think there's also a validity to it.  There's a balance.  It's not everything.  But you think you've got to, you know, there is some kind of a point to it.  Because when L.A. stopped doing certain things, the air did become better.  Yeah, they don't have the smog problem they did. 
[02:43:30]  But you know why?  It does work.  Because it reached the point where it was a fucking problem.  Yeah.  So when it reaches a problem, that's when human beings, we're lazy by nature.  So when we have to do something, we figure out, you know, I want to go to the moon and  it's the cod.  All right.  Yeah, go to the moon.  Ten years.  We got it.  We got it.  We're on it.  The Soviets are fucking with us with the space program.  Ah, we're on it.  And it's like anything else.  The second you have to do something is when it gets done. 
[02:44:00]  Right now, I go to a gas station.  I pull a little thing.  Gasoline comes out.  Hey, happy new year.  When that stops coming out, someone will figure something else out.  But for now, fill her up, premium motherfucker.  I got to drive.  Do you think how premium makes a big difference over a regular?  I always use premium.  In my vehicles, I use premium.  I do, too.  Do you really?  Well, I have a high performance car, so I'm thinking.  That's exactly what I got.  As do I.  So you've got to put the premium in there. 
[02:44:30]  Yes, you do.  Keeps the fucking...  How do you know it's not the same shit?  That's what I'm saying.  How do you know there's...  What's the difference?  One's cut with water?  If you're buying a new car, you never...  It's octane levels, my friends.  You never have the car long enough to know if that gas made a difference.  It runs better.  I've actually found it running better.  You feel like it runs better?  I actually do.  I don't know.  Keeps it cleaner.  Can't be bothered.  Just fucking fill it up.  And fucking...  The reason California's small, because there's fucking...  20 billion cars here.  You're not going to get that smog and other... 
[02:45:00]  Of course, it has been cleaned up.  Geography does it, too.  It's in a valley.  The heat from the sun ionizes the fume, and it just lays it.  That's why a lot of other cities don't have a smog problem like L.A. does, because it's geography.  Yeah, and also, they didn't just clean up.  It's just technology, like he says.  Well, it's different emissions for California.  California emissions are very strict on cars.  Yeah, it's a process.  I'm saying that.  They've actually switched over, and there are results for it.  But, you know, it's just all... 
[02:45:30]  Sorry.  P-Roll is...  He's a legitimate source.  I'm really sorry.  There is breaking news that I've been sort of following, but now there's a fact that has  to be said immediately, and I apologize, you guys.  Rich is an idiot.  For jumping in like this.  P-Roll, he's good for this.  Plane from LaGuardia, I guess, emergency, landed in Philadelphia for a bomb scare.  Now, this is the fact that just came out.  Suspect had wires attached to his hands and head, and then P-Roll writes, how the fuck  did he get on a plane with wires on his hands and head? 
[02:46:00]  Wires on his hands and head.  Yeah.  The U.S. Airways flight diverted to Philadelphia after incident.  Yeah.  Supposedly, it's going to turn out to be a nut job, but he has wires attached to his  hands and head.  It was probably one of those things on his braces.  Oh, headgear?  Maybe he's wearing his retainer?  That's another smokescreen.  A couple had an argument on a plane, a guy and a lady, and they landed a plane because  of that. 
[02:46:30]  That's all bullshit, too.  It's ridiculous.  Why is it so...  Here's the deal, because L.A. Airport does this.  They have cops outside the airport.  When you go into L.A., they have roadblocks there.  If you want to just drive a truck into a fucking airport, you know what I mean, and do something  destructive, I don't want to say that you're wrong.  Maybe you do.  Maybe you do.  I have no desire to fucking do that.  I know.  What's that?  Yeah, what's the matter?  What I'm saying, L.A., you want the only airport...  Let's check your underpants.  Make sure you don't have a bomb.  Jimmy, check his underpants for a bomb, will you? 
[02:47:00]  You know you can drive a vehicle from the highway onto the runways.  There's no fucking gates.  There's no cement blocks.  There's no security.  Is that what I'm...  Wait, you're asking me this?  Yeah.  What were you saying?  No, I'm just saying if...  I do it in GTA, so it's got to be possible.  That's true.  I'm saying it'd be...  Whatever.  Can we take a break?  We got Jeff Ross here.  And one other thing about airplanes, and when I was getting off the other day...  Do you hate those little things?  I swear to God, getting off the plane... 
[02:47:30]  This is one of my bits, new bits, but this is true.  They said, when they landed, when we landed from San Francisco the other day, they said,  if you need a wheelchair, please stay in your seat and wait for...  Opposed to, what, falling out and laying in the aisle like a human speed bump?  They have to tell them to stay in their seat.  That's actually pretty good, Reg.  Do not get involved with the Taekwondo tournament in the back.  Just because we were just flying.  Don't think you can walk now.  I would assume 20 minutes after everyone else got off the plane, you go in and see which 
[02:48:00]  dummies are still sitting in their seats.  They forgot they can't walk.  You've got to remind them.  That's pretty good, Reg.  Reg is going to be at the Comedy Zone, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, tomorrow and Saturday.  Quick break.  Jeff Ross next.  Bye.  Got a busy show today.  Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and now Jeff Ross in the studio, who's going to be at Caroline's  tonight through Sunday.  I highly recommend you go see Jeff Ross at Caroline's. 
[02:48:30]  Thank you.  Yeah, if you're in New York, I would.  I would definitely go see them.  It's going to be a phenomenal show.  And Rich is going to be in Harrisburg, PA, at the Comedy Zone.  So you could not go to that.  Well, that's sort of why.  I just was nice to you.  I was just saying nice things to you.  I don't need you to be nice to me.  It doesn't help me.  Yes, it does.  I'm going to do a lot of next things.  A plug from you is like not a plug.  That's a good point.  That is a very good point.  You got anything on that, Rich?  You're in my home.  I'm only kidding you, buddy.  Give me one of your old CDs to break. 
[02:49:00]  If you listen to it.  Don't pretend you don't remember.  I do remember.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  Oh, you gave Jeff a CD and he broke it in front of you?  Yes, because he was upset that he didn't have one.  First I used it as a coaster, then I smashed it.  At least he got some of yours out of it.  You know, I'd go back to Voss.  I used to pick him up, drive him to gigs.  We'd work out.  I'd buy him lottery tickets, anything to get stage time back in the day.  He's still doing it.  Remember, we did a college.  We did something. 
[02:49:30]  No, it was a graduation show.  They stole my cigarettes.  The greatest show ever.  The greatest show ever.  I somehow got a gig.  This was 15 years ago, probably.  I'm just starting to do comedy for money.  And this prom hires us.  Like, we have to be at the prom.  The show starts at 3 a.m.  We drive out to Long Island after the prom.  All the kids are in their tuxedos trying to get hand jobs under the table.  I go out.  I do my 20 minutes or whatever. 
[02:50:00]  It's just awful.  It's just brutal.  We just have to get through the time.  Kids are getting, like, tireder and drunker and drunker.  And I bring up Voss, and he's on stage, and he's kind of bombing.  It's not great.  It's an impossible situation, honestly.  And he's doing the best he can.  And then, you know, he has a stool behind him with his cigarettes and a cup of coffee behind him.  And he's out front doing his act and getting some, like, titters, you know, little laughs.  But all of a sudden, he slowly starts killing every joke.  Every setup is just ripping the roof off the place.  And I'm in the back watching this drunk kid sneaking up behind Voss really, really slow. 
[02:50:30]  Goes to the stool, takes one of Voss' cigarettes, lights it up behind him.  Voss has no idea this guy's behind him.  Voss thinks he's killing it.  And the guy's sitting on the stool drinking Voss' coffee and smoking his cigarettes.  Voss has no idea.  That is fucking great.  No, I just thought all of a sudden he turned around on stage.  I'm going, this is where I got him. 
[02:51:00]  Okay?  You know, you're getting laughs.  You're going, I've got to keep doing this.  That's as bad as when we were waving, thinking everyone was excited that we went to that movie theater.  What movie was that again?  That fucking Will Ferrell piece of shit fucking basketball movie.  You thought they were waving at you when you were walking in the theater?  I'm thinking, oh, you're telling the story again.  But K-Rock sends us to this theater.  And we're like, oh, fuck.  And it was the Will Ferrell movie.  What was it?  Semi-pro, whatever the thing it was.  And we walk in and everyone has their arms up. 
[02:51:30]  And I'm like, oh, wow.  God, it's such a pain in the ass to be famous.  So I put my arm up.  Hey, what's up?  We're here.  Not knowing that they're throwing Frisbees and T-shirts out from the audience.  People were just like, yay, yay, yay.  I had no idea.  I should have known because it was all black people.  I mean, I know we have black listeners, but not that many.  Did you feel stupid?  Dude.  Did you catch a Frisbee?  I didn't really.  I just, I was, I hid in my seat.  You were humiliated.  And it turned out, honestly, there might have been two listeners there. 
[02:52:00]  They picked the worst theater.  It was in gang territory in Times Square.  And we had to learn that if you're a blood, you go to this theater.  If you're a crip, you go across the street.  It's a whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, on 42nd Street.  Gangsters have movie theaters?  Oh, yeah.  They figured it out.  Like, all right.  Yeah, they got two big theaters right there.  It's their turf.  That's so ridiculous.  And that's where they decide to send us.  And I walk in and everyone's got their fucking arms in the air.  I'm like, this fame thing sucks. 
[02:52:30]  Yo, fuck you.  Julian and Julian is our turf.  We're getting Madea this week.  By the way, if you want to have a good time, go to the IMAX theater and see Precious in 3D.  It's so much sadder.  Bitch, reached out and ate my popcorn.  We were just talking about Precious yesterday.  Jimmy saw it.  Yeah.  How was it?  He brought a serious angle to the whole thing.  It was sad.  Can't we just make jokes about the fat pig? 
[02:53:00]  It was sad.  Then I tweeted how I want to go to the theaters and just jerk off angrily every time she falls.  How was Monique?  She's going to win the Oscar.  She's going to win the Oscar.  She's going to win the Oscar.  Yeah.  Yes.  Her and her hairy legs will win the Oscar.  Yeah, that's pretty disgusting.  I want to thank God.  Mercy of God.  Anybody who has ever been touched.  Does she talk like that?  Martin Luther Queen.  Yeah, she talks like that, all right.  Yeah.  Her acceptance speech was like, you know, she came over the mountaintop. 
[02:53:30]  You see that avatar, Jeff?  Are you a movie guy?  Yeah, I love to see movies.  Did you see Avatar?  I loved it.  I took my little nephews.  They loved it.  You liked it, right?  Very interesting.  It wouldn't have been as great if it didn't have the 3D technology, obviously.  Yeah, it was an experience.  The whole thing was an experience.  You're right.  You're right.  I liked it a lot.  You know what was bad?  Invictus.  That movie really sucked.  That looked awful.  I had no desire to see that.  It looked terrible.  It pissed me off because it could have been amazing.  But what's his name was up for?  Who the fuck?  Morgan Freeman.  They can't stop handing him awards. 
[02:54:00]  I had enough with him already.  He was nominated?  That one in 3D was not very good.  I'm not sure.  Every time they scored a goal, Morgan Freeman just stood up.  It was the same shot of him standing up and clapping over and over and over because they  had no stories.  It was awful.  Is there another black team struggling and they become like champions?  No, it's all white guys.  Oh, it's white guys?  It's South Africa.  It's about rugby, which they never explain how it works.  You're just watching three hours of Matt Damon's ridiculous accent. 
[02:54:30]  It was way too small to play rugby.  It was bad.  Hey, you'll like that one.  Best movie you've seen in a while.  Wild Heart.  Crazy Heart.  Jeff Bridges.  I just saw Crazy Heart.  I liked it a lot, actually.  That Jeff Bridges could act, huh?  And he can sing in this thing.  He's very authentic.  Is that him singing for real?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, he can sing in this thing.  I thought it was a little slow at times.  It's a little slow and I was watching it with my little nephew sleeping so every time the  music came on I had to lower it and whenever he talked you had to make it louder. 
[02:55:00]  I hate when you got to roadie the volume on a movie like that.  Can't you find a friend?  You got to have your nephew and everything?  I was visiting my family in Seattle.  And you know what else I really liked was...  Is that the movie right there?  Yeah.  They're talking about it on TV.  That's where you speak about it.  Jeff Bridges is...  He's just...  He's ridiculous.  But that movie I saw...  Clooney's movie where they were like...  Up in the air.  No, the goat.  The goat something.  Oh, he was in that.  Yeah.  The goat movie.  The one where they kill the goats with their minds. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that sounds really high concept.  Yeah.  What were you saying though?  Oh, I want to see the new Mel Gibson movie because that poster.  Dude.  It's like he's about to call me a dirty kike or something.  He looks so angry.  We'll say it again though.  The fucking trailer gives away the entire movie.  Oh, I didn't watch it too closely.  Don't watch the trailer.  The big billboards everywhere.  Just he looks so angry.  Don't watch the trailer for the movie.  I'm serious.  Because there's a major plot twist that they have no problem showing you as you're waiting.  Yeah.  In my case, waiting for Crazy Heart to start. 
[02:56:00]  It must mean it's a bad movie.  They're giving it away.  Oh, you think?  Well, usually they give it away.  They got nothing.  Oh, that's an interesting theory.  Mm-hmm.  I wonder if that's true.  I would say so.  Yeah.  Leave it alone.  I've been watching the old Rodney movies lately.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm on the Rodney biography tonight on A&E.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was watching the Caddyshack one last night.  It was amazing.  Those movies are still so good.  Fuck it.  The Caddyshack.  They had a whole story behind the scenes of Caddyshack. 
[02:56:30]  What did they say?  The production of it and everything.  It was just really interesting.  The whole set up from the time they went with the concept to Orion Films.  And they had just come off of Animal House.  And, you know, they gave them some concepts that were ridiculous.  And they came up with, like, this golf idea.  But they couldn't get a better golf course to film that movie.  They couldn't get it.  Dude.  If you look closely at the golf course they use, it's a shithole.  Dude, I played that course.  I played it a couple times.  It's a public course, obviously.  They don't take care of it. 
[02:57:00]  Rolling Hills, I think you love it.  With Rolling Hills, they tried to get other golf courses.  You could tell.  First of all, they were filming it in Florida.  They had to get a golf course that had no palm trees.  Because they said it was Chicago.  So they couldn't have palm trees.  I didn't know Caddyshack takes place in Chicago.  Then they said, we're going to blow up your fucking golf course at the end of this.  You know, we're going to make a green in the middle of the fairway at the end and blow it up.  And a lot of golf courses weren't cool with that.  They found that one. 
[02:57:30]  What a bunch of dummies.  They could have been known as the golf course that had Caddyshack.  They found the one golf course where they were like, all right, we'll let you do anything you want.  They're like, okay, cool.  And then they found out it was right at the end of the runway for, I think, Fort Lauderdale Airport.  So every five or seven minutes, a plane would take off.  They'd have to shut everything down.  They had a guy.  Hey, every time I get rolling, you have a fucking plane going off.  Let me talk to the location manager.  They had a guy with a bullhorn standing at the far end of the golf course that would go, plane. 
[02:58:00]  He'd sit there and go, plane.  Oh, Jesus.  It's like when you're playing street hockey.  They'd be like, car, car.  What a pig in the ass.  Give me a, roll me up a dude.  But the palm tree thing is stupid.  Why don't they just say, hey, this story takes place in Florida.  Like, it was really important to the story that's in Chicago.  Because my character was from Chicago, you fucking idiot.  They needed, for the characters, I think, they didn't want it to be Florida.  They kind of wanted it to be, like, I know.  And the story is so disjointed because it was probably a four-hour movie when they wrote it. 
[02:58:30]  Like, Noonan was in every single shot.  They had more about him and his huge family and things like that.  And then they had to cut, they had to literally cut the script in half.  Do they have all that stuff on the DVD?  No.  It probably was never shot.  It was probably a storage thing.  Yeah, they just cut it out of the script.  I thought Caddyshack 2 was much better.  Oh, yes. 
[02:59:00]  It was fantastic.  Jackie Mason is right up there.  They offered me a lot of money.  Horrible.  I was moving on by then.  Horrible.  When they turned that old couple around to hit the ball, it couldn't have been any fucking funnier.  You couldn't tell me something about that movie that I would even know.  I don't know about the first movie.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, oh, that was good.  I did see some clips of the biography that's on tonight.  And they had Harold Ramis, who wrote and directed it, saying a lot of inside stuff about the shooting of the movie.  And they said that Rodney would make the director come to his trailer. 
[02:59:30]  And he would try out different jokes and different versions of old jokes he used to do that he wanted to work into the script.  Yeah, into the script.  Yeah.  So it was very much his stand-up.  How cool is that?  They were talking about how he got the par, because they were thinking of, you know, they just wanted some kind of an older comic.  So they got Rodney, and Rodney comes in, and they said, well, it was a different time.  He came in, he put four lines of coke on the table and did it, and he goes, all right, let's get to work.  Wow.  And that's what they started. 
[03:00:00]  Tony Bavacqua from Dangerfields told me he was at the premiere, and he said that everybody comes up in limos.  And when Rodney came up, he came in a car that was being towed to the premiere.  So that's how he got to the premiere.  He was in a car that had a tow truck calling in.  He got Rodney high at the end of his life.  You guys did?  Yeah, at NAW.  Not us personally, but one of our guys.  Wow.  He smoked weed all the time.  Yeah, one of our guys.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he used to say.  One of our guys who now works here at SiriusXM, Stinky, yeah.  And the guy that's.  Stinky will brag about that, no problem. 
[03:00:30]  Took him to the fucking stairwell during the break.  And they actually, you know who they considered they were actually going to use as Noonan was, what's his name, from the wrestler?  Oh, Mickey Roark?  Mickey Roark.  Oh, Jesus.  He was going to be Noonan.  You know, the Otto would have been better.  Yeah, Otto was supposed to do a young comedian special, you know, one of them.  So Rodney loved him.  Um, so, you know, they wanted to see him one more time.  Oh.  And so.  What an Otto. 
[03:01:00]  You don't fuck this up.  I take it away from the great set.  So they put at Casualizing Storm.  Yeah.  This is what I heard.  They put Otto on first, right?  You can't put him on first.  So he has a tough set.  And Ronnie goes, I don't know, son.  And Otto goes, don't fuck yourself, you old drunk.  How do you open with Otto and George?  That's a catch.  Yeah.  That's a little loser.  He would have been perfect on that fucking young comedian thing.  Was it Nebraska? 
[03:01:30]  Caddyshack was supposed to say that?  Yeah, a few people saying that.  I was supposed to say in Chicago or whatever.  Bob Saget was on that one.  It's a long special.  He told me they cut him down to like two minutes to give Kinison like eight minutes.  I was at the taping.  Oh, really?  Really?  I was at the taping where Hicks, the one where Hicks was on.  It was Hicks.  Were you a waiter?  Then you weren't at that taping.  No, no.  One of the...  Shut up.  He goes, I was at that taping.  You know, the one that he names different guys.  Well, they had a bunch of those fucking shows.  It was, I don't know, Hicks and some other ones.  Fucking Hicks just killed.  How you doing, lady?  You want to make... 
[03:02:00]  What?  What was it?  Want to make eight bucks the hard way?  The hard way.  You must have been something before electricity.  The best movies.  And it's an inspiration to comedians because he didn't even make it until he was in his  forties.  His movies were in his forties and fifties.  Went back to selling aluminum siding for ten years.  He was an old forty, though.  Yeah.  He looked old for his age.  I remember how I found out he passed away.  It was so sad.  I was driving down Melrose in Hollywood and, you know, they always put on the billboards  at the comedy clubs like, so-and-so, make God laugh. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, okay.  And it said Rodney Dangerfield.  It's like it's spelt wrong.  They just ran out of the letters.  That's all.  And, you know, talk about, like, one lasting dignity about getting no respect.  Right.  So I figured he would have loved that.  Maybe they did it on purpose.  I remember him going to the Laugh Factory with his bathrobe, with his schmeckle hanging  out, with a joint in his mouth, trying out one-liners.  Oh, he came into...  During a prom show, he came into catch, and all the kids were like, it's Rodney. 
[03:03:00]  And he went up, he was so fucking wasted.  And he was just all over the place.  And the kids were looking at him like they were just tortured.  What was that?  Your cud just came up.  It was like he was...  But the comics were dying.  It was fucking...  The comics were just dying.  That was my gum that got caught in my mouth.  Sometimes if I'm depressed...  The nicotine gun?  If I'm sad, I will just put on...  I'll just hit his name in YouTube and whatever plays.  Yeah.  Just hearing his voice makes me feel better. 
[03:03:30]  There's a funny motherfucker, man.  You still got the nicotine gum?  Gum?  We're talking about Rodney.  Yes.  Why don't you stop at the Nicorette?  How long have you been on the...  Why don't you stop with the hookers?  Oh, shit.  I like them.  I like this.  I don't chew them while I'm doing radio.  They don't come up in my throat when I'm on the air, stupid.  How long have you been on the hookers?  He has a life now.  He has a girl.  Yes, he does.  A lovely girl.  Exactly.  He's cleaned up his act.  Yes, he has.  Oh, you're right.  I forgot.  You have a nice girl.  Yeah.  Jim's got some balance in his life.  He doesn't. 
[03:04:00]  Rich.  What's that now?  How long have you been on the gum?  And don't lie or we'll know.  Today I quit smoking three...  Wait, when I quit...  Wait, how old are his teeth?  Count back.  When did you get those teeth?  Three years and seven months I've been on the gum.  Why?  Really?  You can't get rid of the gum now?  No.  Isn't there a way they wean you off it or something?  I might sue the company because it doesn't say it.  There's no warning on the side of the box.  That says that's addictive? 
[03:04:30]  Yes.  What do you think?  Chewing gum with nicotine.  Yeah, exactly.  How could it not be?  It's the same with cigarettes.  What do you think?  I knew it was addicting and I did it anyway.  But there was warning.  Can the gum give you like mouth cancer?  Probably can.  Does it taste good?  Huh?  It's terrible.  Yes.  And you get the same buzz from a cigarette?  Not the same.  You get a nicotine rush.  I mean, it's fucking...  You know what I mean?  Can't be good for you.  Huh?  No.  I don't think it could be good for you, though.  Look, I'm surrounded by fucking messes.  I'm just thinking.  Telling me what's good for me. 
[03:05:00]  Shut up, you guys.  Please, you look like the evolution of disaster poster, you three.  I know.  Not bad.  I'm telling them how to live.  I have four bagels already today.  We all have our problems.  What do you understand, Rich?  I walk in.  You want anything to eat?  Yes.  I've already eaten two bagels on my way here.  Huh?  I don't know.  I'm a fat mess.  You're not a fat mess.  Yeah.  Come on.  Look at this.  How did the book do?  Doing well.  Jeff?  Doing real well.  Comes out on paperback for Father's Day. 
[03:05:30]  Nice.  And I've been very gratifying.  Yeah.  Very different experience than doing regular stand-up, as Jim can attest.  Yes, he certainly can.  Get letters from people in hospitals.  You connect to people in a different way, and it's fun.  People have been throwing their own homegrown roasts, because I give the recipe for how  to throw your own roast.  Oh, so yeah, you have a little party at your house, you end up doing a roast.  So roasting is becoming even more of a pastime.  I bet some of those are utter disasters.  Yeah.  I bet it's just like somebody taking it way too personally, fist fight starting. 
[03:06:00]  You've got to know.  I'm very careful to explain it has to be a place of affection while you roast somebody.  You have to know, though.  A little too much booze.  They're down there, made a little dais out of the fucking tables.  They break out for Thanksgiving and shit.  What do you mean?  Sitting there and just calling him a cocksucker, and the guy gets up and just looks him in the  face.  That'd be fantastic.  Me and Patrice did a pilot for Comedy Central where we roasted somebody, they're a wedding  couple at the wedding, and people in the wedding didn't know what was going on. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, shit.  That's pretty good.  It was a guy stood up and said, we have kids here.  I was hosting it.  I go, okay.  Right?  Because I had to get Patrice on.  Patrice didn't even look up.  Right?  He was like this.  And he called some girl fat that was in the wedding party.  Basically called her fat.  In the hallway, she called him.  No, she dropped the inbox.  He called him a nigger?  Yes.  Holy shit.  She goes, I've never said that before. 
[03:07:00]  You're the only one who's ever made me say that.  That's lying.  Oh, man.  I'm sure Patrice was flattered.  Huh?  I'm sure he's flattered.  Wow, that's fucking funny.  How did you two fuck that idea up?  That's pretty good.  No, the pilot was great.  Sounds it.  It was really good, but they just didn't pick it up.  The fucking couple that we roasted, we spent a week with their family and stuff.  And it was just made Patrice's win.  That's still called him the nigger, bro.  It's been a great week. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, shit.  What was the show called?  Huh?  What was it called?  Best Man.  Best Man.  Jesus.  Worst Man.  It was fucking...  Jesus.  Oh, man.  That's all right, man.  Patrice.  So funny.  God.  She's funny, man.  What else is on your radar, Jeff?  It's about you right now.  Well...  Obama, you got the Tiger Woods picture coming out today, so now we know he's in a sex rehab.  He has a beard.  He kind of looks like you, if you were a little darker. 
[03:08:00]  He's got the beard and the wild hair.  That's a sex rehab place.  That's a Christmas party I didn't get invited to.  How do you go to that place?  I would go there just for fun, I think.  That's where you should do a roast.  That would be so fun.  A sex rehab clinic.  I feel like this will be the year for people to start forgiving Tiger.  Yeah?  For cock-blocking the entire country.  I do a bit of my act now about how if he lost all these endorsements, you know, pretty  soon he'll be picking up new ones, you know, like, hey, guys, you want to fuck like me? 
[03:08:30]  Try my new high-protein energy drink, Tiger's Wood.  I got enough energy to hit 18 holes during the day and another 18 holes back at the room.  I'll be in Harrisburg this weekend.  More baby language, Jeff's defeated.  Look at the papers.  Whatever.  I thought we were...  I didn't realize we were...  I didn't realize...  Rich is brutal.  These are the meanest human beings on the planet.  Rich is brutal. 
[03:09:00]  What are you talking about?  You're the one that...  You did the whole thing.  All I know is I heard you did four airplane bits before I came in.  I did one, but it was funny.  Your timing right there was good, Rich.  Now I'm going to depress you with this phone call.  I must admit I did sort of...  John.  John.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good, John.  That nicotine gum has been linked to brain...  To cancer.  There you go, Rich.  It's linked to brain cancer.  There you go.  You have no worries.  Well, here's the thing.  I just had an MRI on my fucking skull, so everything's okay. 
[03:09:30]  I remember.  Oh, in Seattle.  It sounded like when they fucking...  They're looking on the ocean floor for a sub that isn't there.  Like a sub.  So not with nothing returning.  Just bouncing them behind the skull and coming back up.  Wacky host.  That didn't work.  Sorry.  It's dark here.  How about this?  There you go.  I thought it was very funny.  Anthony, the love sponge.  Oh.  Go blow, you fucking cunch.  Fuck you.  I don't even know the guy.  Why did I offend you?  I don't know. 
[03:10:00]  Because he's a piece of shit.  He's just a dumb hillbilly.  That's why.  Fuck him.  He's really a dumb guy.  Equate me to that.  I don't even know.  They just told me in the other room that he wants to box you.  You'd fuck...  You'd kill him.  I would, to be honest with you.  I mean, I looked at you.  I looked at him.  I'd just laugh at him.  He's a silly boy.  He got beat up by a woman recently, too, I hear.  Really?  He's just a silly little boy.  Your girlfriend left?  You split up with that girl?  Yeah.  You're single, Jeff?  Wow.  Over Thanksgiving, we broke up. 
[03:10:30]  You want to get some pussy or what?  What do you want?  What do you want us to do for you?  What do you got in mind?  What do you want us to do for you?  How do you break up over Thanksgiving?  I did meet a chick here once.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, Anne's got a good question.  Right around the holidays?  Right around, right after Thanksgiving.  Was it, you know...  It's always painful.  What happened at Thanksgiving that you said, you know what?  I'm done.  Was it you or her?  She poured into my aunt's mouth.  She fucked my uncle.  It was terrible.  Worst Thanksgiving ever.  To me, those were all things that were salvage a relationship.  She was cute, man. 
[03:11:00]  She's very beautiful.  Hey, good, good, Rich.  Just keep rubbing it in.  There's nothing worse when you break up with a girl and someone's like,  Oh, she was really hot.  Cute and nice and sweet.  Jesus, I don't think you could ever do better than that.  Are you bummed out?  He always has the hottest girls on the planet.  It's been sad.  You know, breakups are always sad.  Why the breakup?  Unless you don't want to share.  What happened?  I just sort of grew apart, I guess.  How long were you with her?  A year and a half.  She wasn't the one.  Pretty fast.  Now I'm looking for the two.  What about that hot dancing chick? 
[03:11:30]  You keep in touch with her?  Editor.  Yeah.  Dance with the stars?  Yeah, we're still very good friends.  You still want to get in there, right?  She's definitely very beautiful.  But she's married.  She's married to a dancer on the show.  But you want to.  Well, we're trying to kill him, but it's not that easy.  You brought her in for us.  That was a nice day.  That was a fun day.  I still thank you for that.  Legs for D.  I know.  She's very cool.  I wrote a whole chapter in my book about my worshiping her.  She knows my true feelings.  Did you ever get a boner while you guys were practicing? 
[03:12:00]  She did once.  Yeah, you know, it was hard because I really had to make a conscious effort to look at her  and go, this is like my coach.  I looked at her like she was Mr. Sinise, my high school football coach, so I wouldn't  get distracted.  A little high dad, yeah.  Because you have to learn the steps.  It's really hard.  Matt in Washington, we're talking to Jeff Ross, who's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow  and Saturday.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  Hey.  Hey, Jeff, I've watched your special with Larry 15 times, and you guys play such a good 
[03:12:30]  role with one another.  Is that a setup?  Yeah, that's Steven Glickman.  He's a very, very funny actor who's on a Nickelodeon show now called Big Time Rush.  Can you explain it for people that haven't seen it?  This guy can explain it.  Phenomenal.  Matt, what happens?  You guys set it up.  Well, you just randomly call a piano player, and Fat Larry comes down with his blue hair  who just really set it up well.  But at first, you know, it really looks real.  But after seeing it 15 times, I had to ask. 
[03:13:00]  On my stand-up DVD, there's a part of the end of the show where I have a piano on stage.  I'll do it tonight at Caroline's, but it won't be set up.  And I do love poems, and I bring up just whoever wants to come up to the audience and play.  And I brought a girl up, and we did a poem, and she was funny, and then I dismissed her.  And then I had met this guy in L.A.  He just came up randomly one night.  He was just this big, fat guy who looks like Shrek.  He had a really fun laugh, and he was a great piano player, and really easy to make fun of. 
[03:13:30]  So I said, all right, well, just come up in my Jersey show, and just when I ask you what you do, just say I'm a toll taker.  Because he's a big, fat guy.  There's no way he fits in the toll.  So we rehearsed it a couple times at the Borgata, and then we just did it and wound up doing it on the DVD.  And people, he's so real, and we had good chemistry.  People don't realize it's set up until they watch it like this guy, like a fucking lunatic.  It was an amazing, amazing experience.  Great shot, guys.  Thanks for the show, bud. 
[03:14:00]  Thank you, brother.  I was in Lowman's, and some hot girl came up to me in L.A., and she goes, I know you.  I go, how?  She goes, I used to go out with Jeff Ross.  Oh, boy.  She has like three kids now, a couple kids, but she was fucking hot.  I can't remember.  She had dark hair.  Just keeps going, this guy.  I'm talking about him.  I'm complimenting her.  How about you give him a phone call after the show?  Oh.  What was her name?  Three kids.  What was her name?  She had two kids.  She was fucking hot.  Really?  Yeah.  Couldn't be anybody.  Complimenting her, saying how he gets hot girls.  Are you dating?  Are you dating?  I guess I'll start soon, you know? 
[03:14:30]  I just started getting back in the saddle.  Yeah, but like fucking Thanksgiving till now?  What are you, celebrating?  You know, I'm just real fucking.  You ever start dating too early, and the original girl comes back, you're like, you're dating  her, and I'm like, yeah, we were broken up.  What the fuck?  I know.  I'm a slow starter.  How much time are you supposed to wait?  I like being by myself.  I need a little bit of an emotional cleanse.  Alone time.  Are you worried about what she's doing, though?  That's what always fucks me up, is I start worrying about who they're banging.  That's the most terrifying thing, because I know any minute I'm going to see a picture  of her and Warren Sapp somewhere.  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Remember, I'm dancing with the stars, he'd always give her a big hug and say, when you're  ready to bump this guy.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Aren't those guys the greatest?  Yeah.  Oh, they're so much fun.  Oh, look at assholes.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, we'll see.  You know.  Life is long.  Life is long.  I would like to settle down one of these days.  Really?  Yeah.  It works.  It works for some of you guys.  Look how happy Voss is.  I can't break up, because if my wife and I break up, the guy she's fucking, I'll be working 
[03:15:30]  with the next night.  Okay?  I'll be...  I have to sit with him at the comedy cellar.  You'll have to videotape him for your documentary.  Ooh.  You and Bonnie doing it?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  We only have...  By the way, I was at Lominger today, and I saw somebody used to go out with...  She was a fucking dog.  She had, like, three kids.  How many shows are you doing this weekend?  Six.  Tonight through Sunday.  Wow.  I'm trying something different.  It's an experiment.  An organ?  I'm going to speed roast.  I'm going to bring up volunteers from the audience. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah?  Just at a random point in the show, whoever wants to come up, and I'll speed roast, like  a long line of people.  That's pretty funny.  15 seconds of pain.  How will you know, like, what to talk about?  I'll ask them where they're from or whatever.  I'll just look at them.  Give them a quick...  Oh, a visual...  More of a visual roast.  More of a visual roast, but sometimes people will start talking...  You want to try it here?  We got interns and shit.  Sure.  For real?  Well, if you're going to help me, if you're going to fucking roll your eyes and...  I didn't roll no fucking eyes, Kay. 
[03:16:30]  I'm happy to help you, Jeffrey.  I'm a very good roaster.  I didn't roll no fucking eyes.  I know.  When I did my...  Which was?  The whole time you were fucking talking.  I didn't roll my eyes once.  All right.  I don't even know how to.  I mean, like, I did my tiger bit.  Voss rolls his eyes when he eats like a dummy, like a shark.  I mean, like, my tiger bit.  The tiger bit was good.  It wasn't bad.  It's just even, you know...  That was so bad.  I know.  No one even caught how bad he was fucking...  What happened?  What happened?  Uttered a bomb.  It really was a fucking... 
[03:17:00]  A complete dud.  Sam, we got people that Jeff could do a speed roast with?  Bring them in.  Bring them in.  Bring that skinny guy in.  I say you get Love Buzz, Troy Kwan, who else?  Who else would...  Definitely Troy Kwan.  Love Buzz.  Us.  Yeah, he got Love Buzz.  Tell me a little bit about everybody, one at a time.  Bring them all in at once, I guess.  All right.  Whatever you want to do.  Mars would be good.  It's a good practice for Caroline's this weekend.  That kid, the one, the skinny, heroin-looking kid, the Calvin Klein commercial kid.  Half the staff around here.  Half the people that walk these halls have that look. 
[03:17:30]  This kid just got mugged three days ago at knife point by some big black guy.  He went to the wrong theater.  No, it was right outside the building here.  Here?  Yeah, Love Buzz.  What happened?  Because we haven't talked to you about it yet.  We've kind of hinted at that.  I was on 44th, and this guy comes up to me.  He's like, hey, you want to see some girls?  Some big black guy.  He's like, nah, I got to go to work.  Then I was like 47th and 6th.  It was right around here.  He followed you with three blocks?  Yeah.  And you just fucking didn't do anything? 
[03:18:00]  Well, he had a knife in his hand.  Well, for three blocks.  I mean, for three fucking blocks.  How about you look and go, there's an obvious problem here.  I'm going to change course.  I'm going to fucking do something.  Get myself in with, you know, around a better lit area where some people are, even if I'm a little late for work.  I didn't notice them.  How do you not notice the big black guy that questioned you if you want girls?  I don't know.  He just ran up to me.  You're a mark.  I guess so. 
[03:18:30]  So he came up to you and said, you want girls?  You said no.  You keep walking two blocks.  This guy's fucking following you.  And then what happened?  And then he approaches me again.  Do you want girls?  Except this time he had a knife in his hand.  Ah.  And then.  Where was this?  It was like 47th and 6th.  It was right around here.  How big was the knife?  Oh, he didn't open it.  It was like a pocket knife.  Oh, it wasn't even open.  Run.  An unopened pocket knife.  Yeah, why did you run your ass off?  He held up a bullet at me.  He said he was going to throw it at him. 
[03:19:00]  I held up a bullet.  Don't make me get my gun.  That was the worst threat ever.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I'll throw this bullet at you.  You weren't even mugged.  Why didn't you run?  I don't know.  He came up close to me.  Borrowed money from you.  He came up close to me.  So I was afraid he was going to push the knife into my stomach and open up the pocket knife.  And just, you know.  Open you like a letter.  Yeah.  So he said, what did he do then?  He came up to you. 
[03:19:30]  Now, he got right in your face?  Yeah.  And he said, do you want girls again?  And I said, no.  And he says, what do you got?  He's like, give me your money.  So I just pulled a bunch of money in my wallet.  And he did say, give me your money.  Yeah.  Do you look like he was on the dope?  Probably.  He probably was.  If you get the money, do you go, now I'd like to see the girls?  Did you get that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where are the girls?  He was acting very friendly.  He was weird.  He was friendly, but he had the knife.  But it was an open run. 
[03:20:00]  He's a big guy.  He didn't threaten you or men.  He just had it in his hand.  Just showing you.  And he said, give me your money.  Yeah.  Why do you talk like you've been jerking off and you had a stop right in the middle?  Well, how do you know I wasn't jerking off that?  I'm so sorry.  You got me.  You got me.  You weren't jerking off.  You're going to fucking job when somebody doesn't have a knife.  Oh, yeah.  Look at you.  Yeah.  I'm a Sharpie.  You're on the no-fly list and the no-fuck list. 
[03:20:30]  I think the roast has started.  All right.  Next.  Next.  That's it, huh?  That was good.  How much money did he get?  No, I thought it was 15 seconds of pain.  What?  I gave him 30 bucks.  How much did you have?  I had 50.  I kept 20 for myself.  So you're lying.  That's smart.  You thought your life was worth $20 more.  Well, I just grabbed it really quick.  What did you grab?  It out of your pocket?  Or was it in your wallet?  It was in my wallet.  And he didn't notice that you didn't take it all out?  No.  Did you go to a cop after it and say it?  No, I brought up the police and that's when he ran off. 
[03:21:00]  And he threw a paper under a car.  What do you mean you brought up the police?  I said, because he was acting friendly.  He was like, I was called the police.  And that's when he ran off and got mad.  That's the worst.  The two of you make me sick.  I know.  He's an awful crook and you're an awful muggy.  Yeah.  And what did he do?  He threw a piece of paper somewhere?  He threw a piece of paper under a car.  What was it?  I don't know.  I think it was...  You didn't grab it?  I looked at it.  It was an empty piece of paper.  I thought my money wasn't there.  I thought maybe I got off lucky.  I guess not.  You thought he was going to throw the money under the car. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Mitch Fittell?  Anyone?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little Mitch?  Not at the top of Mitch.  It's like Mitch Paytell.  All right.  What do we do, Jeff?  This is your thing.  You're going to be doing the carolage.  To me, it's like one laugh, two laughs, and you go on to the next person.  All right.  Let's go, then.  Let's do the chick next.  The chick.  What's that, Sam?  Why don't you introduce these people, Sam?  Yeah.  Who the hell are you?  We don't know these people yet.  I've never seen this coming up next.  Yes.  Sean.  Wait, who's this?  Hack de la Roca? 
[03:22:00]  Zach de la Roca.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  Rage Against the Machine.  Yeah.  Sean.  Our new intern, Sean.  Sean.  How's it going, man?  I think he looks more like, what's her name from fucking Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  The redhead.  The redhead.  Yeah, you kind of look like Winona Ryder a little bit.  I'm saying Scott Strap of Creed.  All right.  Big insult.  More like crud.  Is that a woman's hat?  It's like...  Everyone needs to know. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, what's that?  Mary Tyler Moore.  Are you hoping Sylvester Stallone will take you on a date in that hat?  Fucking hat stinks, man.  Win, Rocky, win.  It's from the Asian website.  It's from what?  That I buy all my clothes off of.  Oh, you buy all your clothes off of that?  Yeah.  Those are some small pants.  Yeah.  What's the website called?  YesStyle.com.  Yeah.  Do you think Ted Knight knows his hat from Caddyshack is missing? 
[03:23:00]  He looks like a young Barry Manilow.  He looks like a fucking mime.  Oh, yeah.  I got that a lot.  He's a hip mime.  Profile Barry Manilow.  Yeah.  Really?  Where are you from?  And then what?  Allentown?  Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  What made you want to intern for this radio program?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Good answer.  How do you make money?  Parents.  Oh, yeah?  What do they do?  My dad works for AIG. 
[03:23:30]  He's in Iraq right now.  You're shaking.  Your lips are quivering.  I know his legs are going to catch on fire.  Your lips are quivering.  What is he doing in Iraq?  Uh, he's in the Air Force.  Wow.  Oh, there you go.  He just got shipped over this month.  He must be so proud of you.  You make Sam look like Holyfield.  I know.  He's like...  He's got a nice package, though.  Jesus.  Jesus, Voss needs to get laid.  What do you like about it, Rich?  Huh?  What do you like about it? 
[03:24:00]  You see those tight pants.  I mean, you know, you look at it.  You can see everything.  Well, and his, you know, his soft talk.  Is he circumcised?  His soft talk and everything.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be gay with him.  It's kind of taking it.  It wouldn't be gay with him.  With the hat, you do it from behind.  You're thinking, I'm with a girl.  That's all I'm saying.  Jimbo, what do they call skinny gay guys?  Twinks.  Twinks.  He's a twink.  All right.  I don't know about this guy.  He's kind of ripe to be made fun of.  I know, but...  His dad's a hero.  I feel like we've got to give him a good slack. 
[03:24:30]  No, his dad is fighting for the right.  For you to make fun of his homosexual son.  I know.  That's true.  Are you gay about his sexuality?  No.  Are you not gay?  Engage.  You're not gay?  Yeah, you're engaged.  You're engaged in a complete farce.  How's the relationship?  My boyfriend's weird.  Every time he looks at my pussy, he yells,  Eee, yuck.  What's the beard's name?  He thinks, like, where is it?  So you're engaged.  Yeah.  I just moved in with my girlfriend.  Oh, that's nice.  On the 89th and 1st. 
[03:25:00]  You're going to support her on your internship?  I don't have to get that whole thing, but...  She pays the bills.  She does?  She works at Bloomingdale's.  She does?  Wow.  Yeah.  What is she, like 300 pounds?  No, no.  Don't.  She's bigger than me.  Everybody is.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking the load on your back is bigger than you.  Karen Carpenter was bigger than you.  Where did you meet her?  Like, she said, like,  I'm dying to fuck a guy who wears a hat from Welcome Back, Connor.  And that's his little brother's pirate shirt. 
[03:25:30]  That's cool.  You're like a skinny...  You're like a fatter Nicole Richie.  So what happened?  Where did you meet this girl?  It's due to Roosevelt Island last year.  Okay.  Is your girlfriend's name Fez?  She was swimming...  She was swimming from Haiti.  What?  She was swimming over from Haiti.  She's Dominican.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Oh, really? 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  She must use you as a vibrator.  Wow.  Interesting.  Does she got that ace?  What?  Does she have that Caribbean ace?  Oh, she's like half white, half Dominican.  Oh, that's a good girl.  Her own Sam has a little...  We don't know what's in him.  That's an optimistic way to look at it.  Let's see under the hat.  Let's see her.  You're a boy who's slight of build.  Oh, she's very pretty.  Is she pretty, Jimmy?  I can't see.  His hands are moving.  He looks like an epileptic Q-chip. 
[03:26:30]  Very fucking cute girl, man.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  She's doing it for...  Very pretty.  Is she doing it for citizenship?  What are you saying?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, but you can't see.  She might just widen out from here.  She might be nice.  She is beautiful.  Yeah.  It's...  Can I see?  Her father's Dominican.  Mother's white.  And what is she doing?  What you be going out with here?  Why you bring this mighty corn into the house?  Caribbean Jimmy.  The boy like penises. 
[03:27:00]  Caribbean Jimmy, yes.  She's hot.  Who's going to walk you down the aisle?  Wow, he's catching some shit.  She's pretty.  It's a little in turmoil right now.  Anybody need a housekeeper?  Uh-oh.  She's going to go on Peace Corps.  What?  Oh, his face.  Are you all right?  I know.  His face just...  I know.  He smiled and his face shook.  You're going to have a heart attack now, aren't you?  Don't be nervous.  No, I'm fine.  We're nice kids.  She's going to go on the Peace Corps next year, so that might...  We don't know if we're going to get married and then she's going to be gone for four. 
[03:27:30]  She's going to be gone for four years.  That's a good way to start a marriage.  Yeah, exactly.  I was going to join her, but I don't know if I want to do that.  Yeah, where do they send her?  Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't get married.  Here's what I'm going to tell you to do.  Rwanda?  Because I've been mad.  Listen, and I can read people.  This is what you have to do.  This is serious.  Just suck one dick and find out if you're making the right decision.  I'm just saying.  What I'm saying, just one dick.  Because you might be stepping into something that you're not supposed to do. 
[03:28:00]  Or just hold a dick next to your face.  It's not gay if you just need to know, right?  Yes.  You're doing it.  Oh, God damn.  Just hold it next to your face, and if you're facing it, go like a magnet to each other.  All right.  You want to move on to that?  No.  It's the greatest.  Thank you.  No, no.  We don't have to.  Give a round of applause to the hip burglar.  We can go back to him.  He's still in the studio. 
[03:28:30]  Sam, who do we got?  We're trying out Jeff Ross's speed roast thing he's doing at Caroline's tomorrow and Saturday.  This is fun.  Even though he was asked to stay, Marr has stepped out probably to do another push-up contest that he does with the other engineers.  Well, the online feed is down.  Our channel is the only one affected.  What conditioner are you using now?  He's working on it.  Conditioner?  Yeah.  It's in Bumble and Bumble.  Why do you ask?  What the fuck is that?  It's a black people thing.  It's made for curly, coarse hair.  Or black people.  Is it black people shampoo? 
[03:29:00]  It's made for coarse hair, yeah.  Soul blow.  All right, Sam, who's coming?  Government chief.  Who do we got next?  Another new intern, and this one has some tattoos.  Here's Chris.  Chris, all right.  Hi, Chris.  What's up, guys?  What's in your back pocket?  My wallet.  No, on the other side.  Gloves.  Gloves?  Fingerless gloves.  I don't like gloves and fingers.  I heard you're going into the Peace Corps.  No, not me.  The other guy.  The other guy. 
[03:29:30]  What are the gloves for?  For keeping my hands warm.  But no fingers?  It's not the part that gets cold.  I got that.  It's the part that gets cold.  No, you know, my hands get really cold and start to crack.  So it's not my fingers.  It's just my knuckles.  Your hands crack.  Where are you from?  New Jersey.  What part?  Bernd County.  A lot of Jersey boys here today.  Anyway, this would have been quicker to serve us all ambient. 
[03:30:00]  It's like buying pants without knees at them or something.  How'd you get the internship here?  I went to Connecticut School Broadcasting.  Ah, really?  Boy, did you make it.  CSP grass.  Did they reopen?  They were closed and reopened?  They closed.  Yeah, they closed actually like right before I got in and opened.  What happened?  You were like the 30th caller?  Yeah.  So what did they teach you in there that you think is useful in the radio business? 
[03:30:30]  It's most of this equipment that I think I'd be able to use.  I don't like the fact that your shoes look like the hospital lobby in Terminator 2.  What the fuck?  That is a great little silly reference.  What do you mean?  They're the Fast Time sneakers.  Yeah, they are.  They are.  There's all these speakers that even wail into his head when slow times at O&A high.  Now the online feed is back, so is Mars around? 
[03:31:00]  He better be.  Let's bring Mars in.  We've got a couple more to get through here.  What do you do for a living?  Make a lot of money.  Bartender and waiter.  And I also do sanitation.  Did you see a movie cocktail?  Sanitation.  Sanitation.  You can watch it and then wind up like the one, but not Tom Cruise.  Sanitation?  Where?  It's like a small, actually like a rubbish removal service type thing.  Take care of Rich.  It's like a lot over his shoulder.  Get it, rubbish?  I don't know. 
[03:31:30]  I was there in time.  You almost said anticlimactic, but you knew you couldn't say that.  He would have said anticlimactic.  You get a lot of pussy being a bartender?  Not anymore.  I have a girlfriend.  You get a lot of pussy being a rubbish remover?  You certainly dress for it.  You have a girlfriend?  Yeah, I do.  Tell Jeff what that's like.  Why are you just getting mean, Rich?  Jesus.  Poor guy's going through a heartbreaking time.  Who gives a fuck?  He goes through girls like that.  He'll get one tomorrow. 
[03:32:00]  He's a fucking celebrity.  That's a good one, Aunt Rich.  My nephew gets girls like other people get colds.  He gets fucking mouth cancer.  Let's move on, Sam.  Who do we got next?  Who do we got next?  Who's next, Sam?  Next, he's no intern.  He's the world famous Troy Kwan, everybody.  Troy Kwan.  This is Club Soda County's personal producer.  Wow.  Bob's big boy's haircut.  Yeah, he's never heard of that one.  Thanks for wearing your shirt from fifth grade. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, no problem.  What is that exactly?  I don't know.  It's his shirt.  Just felt like putting it on today and walking out the door.  I don't know.  I love the Cameron Diaz come in your hair look.  I don't like making fun of his hair.  Why?  He's a nice guy.  I apologize, President Reagan.  More like President Kennedy after the drug.  Exactly.  Can you just go back and to the left? 
[03:33:00]  That's hilarious.  How long do you have to sleep to get your hair to look like that?  It's eight hours.  Just get up and go.  Throw some jelly.  Not too concerned.  Just make sure it's standing up.  With a hat, can you come back?  I see the pot tits are growing in nicely.  What is it?  The what?  Pot tits.  Pot tits.  That is funny. 
[03:33:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, God damn.  That's funny.  Kwan is not fucking pleased.  No.  That's good.  Anyway.  There you go.  That's it.  What do you have to say for yourself?  Anything?  Excited to be in here with you guys, hanging out.  He's very useful to the program.  Yes, he is.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Sam, who do we got left here?  I did forget to mention that the reason Troy never comes on air is because he said he's  afraid he'll go in there and people will start making fun of him.  Oh, shit.  I forgot.  Who's Troy? 
[03:34:00]  Which one is Troy?  This is more of a tribute.  This is more of a tribute.  Yeah, it was.  Speed roasting.  We're speed roasting today.  Done with the love.  And finally, here he is.  Last but not least, Sam.  Last but certainly not least, everybody's favorite engineer and push-up contest winner  today, Marcelino.  Who did he have a contest with today?  He competes with the other engineers about who can do the most push-ups.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  Do you really?  We just do push-ups.  You look like a man who has outgrown his wig. 
[03:34:30]  You look familiar.  Did you try to light your dick on fire on a plane?  No, I did not.  No.  What's your name?  Mars.  Mars?  Like the planet.  All right.  Like the planet.  Thanks for clearing that up.  We thought it was the candy bar.  And most times, people will see the planets and they'll go, which one is that?  That's the planet Mars.  Like the incompetent engineer. 
[03:35:00]  So what do you do for a living, Mars?  I'm an engineer.  Here?  Here, yes.  So who's working the boards right now?  Opie is.  Oh, is that right?  I am?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  So what's your role?  Well, I do the things that you can't see, like fix what's underneath the console, the wires,  the connections, things like that.  Have you ever made a chick doing this job?  No.  Maybe you should get into a rubbish removal.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  This is my, I'm not bailing it.  You've got Gilbert Gottfried's retarded nephew.  All right.  Am I wrong?  Mars is hard to really rip into.  No, he's not.  I know.  He's a martial artist, by the way.  Yes, he is.  He's got a gut.  I'm not going to talk.  What's your shirt say?  Team Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Oh.  It's in Carvalho.  Huh?  It's in Carvalho.  What's the T-shirt under your T-shirt say? 
[03:36:00]  What's wrong with you?  Army.  Army.  All man things.  We get it.  Who dressed you?  FEMA?  You already have three layers on.  Are you homeless?  No, actually, I run here in the morning, so the bottom T-shirt, you know, takes, wicks  the sweat away.  And you leave it on?  Yeah.  Why do you run here in the morning?  Because you could get robbed out there.  Yeah.  Apparently.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I walk from the Port Authority here, and I don't have too much time. 
[03:36:30]  You walk from home here?  Hey, not bad.  You're a good sport.  You're a good sport.  Thank you.  You like working here?  I love it.  Oh, yeah?  I love working with the O&A people.  What do you think would be the most exciting moment of your entire radio career?  What was or what will be?  What will be?  How would you know that?  I don't know.  I'm looking forward to certain things, but what was?  I'm saying is there a defining moment in your experience here? 
[03:37:00]  Electricity.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  I found a pickled punk when we first started working together.  What?  And that fucked me up a little bit.  Yeah.  What's he saying?  Who has that now?  You gave it back.  Yeah, I did.  Because of me.  I don't want to be fucking cursed.  I found an aborted fetus while they were on vacation.  And I had no idea of the show. 
[03:37:30]  I love how he explains things.  Just let that sit.  And you found an aborted fetus?  Yes.  How can you take the excitement out of that story?  It's embarrassing.  Don't you wish you found some shoe polish?  It's my work shoes.  Your work shoes?  Oh, my God.  No punchline after that.  No, that's always a great comedian tactic.  Just set up.  Just repeat it.  No, but then repeat it.  Your work shoes.  So you can think.  A lot of times shit does come, too.  Come.  When you repeat it.  Not in that case it does. 
[03:38:00]  In that case, you just basically stated a fact after he stated it.  Well, the joke was shoe polish.  I'm not going to do another one after it.  It was not a bad joke if you would have saw the shoes.  That's why you had to read it.  I did see the shoes.  I'm looking right at the shoes.  Yes, you are.  Imagine him running here from Port Authority with his gravedigger boots on.  Let's get back to the shoe polish.  Well, it's not easy roasting five of the exact same person.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five fucking radio intern losers. 
[03:38:30]  It's like the cast of Intervention next season.  I know.  It's great.  Well, you're all but good sports.  And this is a good warm-up for my shows this weekend.  So I thank you for that.  Very good.  And with that, I think we're done.  Jeff Ross at Caroline's.  Tomorrow and Saturday.  212-757.  No, tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  You're different than Voss.  I'm sorry.  Starting tonight at Caroline's with Jeff Ross.  212-757-4100.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at Caroline's.  Thank you for that.  Sorry about that.  I have one thing I want to plug. 
[03:39:00]  It's not until February 6th.  But you can get tickets now.  They're free tickets.  It's called Comics Anonymous.  And it's guys who are in recovery doing a show.  Comedy Central is taping it.  I'm hosting it.  It's Voss, myself, Bobby Kelly, and Mike DiStefano.  It's here in New York.  Go to SillyAddicts.com.  Tickets are free.  You know, and it's like, I kind of want to, we all, it's Mike DiStefano's project, but.  It's a great show.  Yeah, and we also, you know, want to do something sober-oriented. 
[03:39:30]  So, free tickets for taping, February the 6th here in New York City.  So, it's, especially if you're in recovery, we definitely want to see you sitting up there.  Oh, shut up, Rich.  No, it's what it's about.  Or Anthony as the example of what could happen.  Yes.  I am not going to be at that show.  Look, what's fun, what's more fun than comedy without booze?  That, that roast we just did.  That went pretty well, actually.  That was pretty good.  We got to know the intern.  It went very well. 
[03:40:00]  But Rich is, that's quick, Rich.  Rich is madly attracted to the one in the Spy vs. Spy shirt.  Yeah, Rich, let's get into this a little bit.  He really is.  Listen, because you could, he's so easy.  You suck dick for coke, I mean, let's be honest.  I never sucked dick for coke.  No.  You looked at his cock.  You looked at his cock.  No, no, first of all, hold on.  You were talking about him in a very feminine way.  Voss would suck dick for Pepsi.  Diet, diet.  Okay.  That's the difference between us.  You're looking at his tight pants. 
[03:40:30]  You can only, how could you not, you know, as a comic, you're very observant.  And when you see the tight pants and that luscious cock bulking out.  How would you put it like that?  If I was gay, I would definitely fucking, I would love to close your deal with him.  Yeah?  You do.  Yeah.  Because he's, yeah, look at him.  He's, there's no fucking fat on him.  He's got to be ripped.  You know, he can't manhandle you.  Rich would roll his pants down like fucking straw covers.  And not only would Rich suck his dick, Rich would hold his ass cheeks with both hands 
[03:41:00]  so the lad couldn't back away.  Even though Voss has awful fucking fence post dental teeth and scraping the poor kid's  fat cock.  Because Voss is a dedicated but horrible cocksucker.  He loves it, but he's just not good at it.  Much like comedy and everything else in life.  What's your kid's name?  I don't know.  Can I ask him out?  Sean?  No, I just don't want to slip and say his name when I'm fucking Bonnie. 
[03:41:30]  By the way, they're built exactly the same.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that hurts.  I know, she almost left me on Thanksgiving.  Why?  But I talked to her in the stand.  Oh, very nice.  I did a couple sit-ups and she said, okay.  Is there a real story there or no?  No.  You're making fun of me.  You never know with you two, though.  Come on.  You're making fun of me.  Fucking A, that's good.  And Rich, you're going to be where again?  Comedy Zone. 
[03:42:00]  Comedy Zone.  In Harrisburg.  And that's Friday Saturday.  And Bonnie's on the show, too.  She won't work with me anymore.  Why the fuck would she come in anymore?  In here?  Yeah.  It's so hard with the baby.  We want to come in when we do the...  How the fuck is this fucking baby?  Is this fucking baby already?  Yeah, bring it in.  14.  No, two and a half.  That's a cute baby, too.  It's a cute baby.  Yeah.  Bring the baby.  Bring the baby?  Yeah.  We had her in here.  I've done that before.  Well, we're going to bring her in when we do the...  Mars doesn't do anything around here.  He can babysit.  Yeah, that's what we want.  It's another fucking Latino watching our kid again. 
[03:42:30]  Again?  What happened?  I know.  You should bring your baby in here.  That would be fun.  We have had the baby here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that was a while ago.  Babies change.  Yeah, I know.  She's getting to the age when we're fucking...  You'll ask for her phone number.  Getting to?  Is the intern's shoes again on TV?  The lobby.  Those fucking...  That obscure little Jimmy remark that was.  This was really fun today. 
[03:43:00]  Yes.  Well, thank you, Jim.  Such a good time.  Let's get out of here and end it on a fun note.  I'm going to tinkle.  Because that's it.  Let's get out of here.  See you guys tomorrow for the Friday show.  I eat the fruit salad. </pre>
