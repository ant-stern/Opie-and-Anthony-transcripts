<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with Opie detailing a frustrating commute punctuated by terrible music on SiriusXM's Grateful Dead and Elvis channels, leading to a mocking discussion of Elvis Presley and his legacy. This segment included callers sharing absurd Elvis-related anecdotes, culminating in a discussion featuring studio guest DJ Fontana, Elvis's drummer, and his wife, Karen.  Fontana shared anecdotes about his time with Elvis, Colonel Tom Parker, and other musicians, often overshadowed by the hosts' tangents and irreverent commentary.  The conversation included discussions of various Elvis songs, a remixed "Blue Suede Shoes," and mentions of E-Rock, known for obtaining autographed items for charity.  The language used was highly vulgar and the tone chaotic.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a 1970s WPIX-FM jingle package, segueing into criticisms of dishonest radio personalities.  The conversation moved to Elvis's death, with Fontana recounting his experiences that day. This transitioned into a discussion of Kenny Rogers' aging and a vulgar, highly detailed recounting of the plot and the hostsâ€™ reactions to the song "Coward of the County," followed by commentary on "Menopause the Musical."  A foot injury incident outside the studio was mentioned, and the segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of Denny's radio jingle collection, interspersed with playing various jingles and further off-color comments.  A final discussion about "Suzy Q" and its use in *Apocalypse Now* ended this section.

Comedian Tom Papa joined the show next.  The conversation started with an unrelated childhood anecdote, followed by Papa discussing a top-secret audition for HBO's *Veep*.  The discussion then turned to vintage toy commercials from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, highlighting their often-blatant racism, violence (including depictions of killing Native Americans and shooting elephants), and contrast with modern advertising standards.  The show then shifted to a serious discussion of a recent foot-loss incident involving a New York City taxi and the racially charged murder of an Australian student in Oklahoma, with the hosts criticizing the media's handling of the latter.  The conversation touched upon race relations and violence, concluding with plugs for Papa's comedy tour, Jim Norton's special, and the Opie and Anthony podcast.

A subsequent segment focused on a recent shooting, heavily emphasizing race and the link between violence, poverty, and aspects of Black culture, using highly offensive and racially charged language.  A caller from Oklahoma City shared similar concerns, discussing local headlines and threats at a local high school.  The hosts and caller continued their discussion about poverty and violence, using highly offensive language and generalizations.  This segued into a segment with comedian Jim Norton, who discussed his new stand-up material about Paula Deen, Anthony Weiner, the Royal Family, and the Kardashians, employing extremely vulgar and offensive language.  Norton's advice segment followed, with callers discussing issues like addiction, marital problems, PTSD, weight loss, relationship anxieties, and depression, receiving advice from Norton, who used his characteristic dark humor and offensive language. Chip Chipperson was briefly present in studio.

A final segment featured Jim Norton fielding more listener calls.  "Jimmy" called about suicidal thoughts, receiving encouragement from Norton to seek help.  A subsequent caller, Dr. Lydia, praised Norton's approach, receiving a sexually suggestive comment from him in response.  Dave from Georgia discussed his shoplifting nanny, Andrew from Youngstown detailed an armed robbery, and John from Ohio talked about his estranged wife refusing to sign divorce papers.  The segment concluded abruptly with Norton apologizing for time constraints, after mentioning several other callers briefly.  A lengthy advertisement for Adam & Eve interrupted the calls.

[00:04:00]  channel uh they find people that did not have a relationship with elvis but that might have had  some kind of like they saw him walking by the by them on the sidewalk one day and and then they  do exciting and then they do a 15 minute story on well tell your story and this guy i guess was  stationed in germany oh during uh when elvis was there and and then and then the guy goes well i  think yeah i think it was after it was on um ed sullivan and then his wife pipes in and goes well 
[00:04:30]  actually you know elvis was on steve allen before he was on ed sullivan that's the kind of content on  the elvis channel and then there was this common area where you could get pots and pans for your  wherever the fuck you live in germany when you're in the army and elvis was very curious to to know if  people were still digging him and his music back in the states and people were supposed to listen i don't 
[00:05:00]  like it i did and then the then the story had no ending i don't even know what the purpose of the  story was he had nothing but he had a brush with elvis i don't know i guess he might have walked by to  get a get a fucking frying pan or something that sounds terrible it's horrendous i'm like what am i  listening to it should be called anything elvis remotely elvis i mean how many how many times can  they play hound dog i guess uh but they get excited they're like oh tell oh oh god tell your

[00:09:00]  oh we got some chat going on the elvis channel right now yeah let's go  i just thought i thought i'd have there for you i knew everybody had elvis story that's a good  elvis story that guy could be that guy could be on the elvis channel they could do that they could  do 20 minutes on that the guy was still cutting hair over there you got some elvis chatting going on  right now yeah they're talking about some guy who did business with him all right yeah let's hear  but you know what dj uh scotty mentions in the book something that's very sad and that is that uh 
[00:09:30]  he never made much money with elvis he he lists all of his tax returns into the book he does yes sir  can you believe that isn't that interesting and the most he ever made of one of elvis is about 18  twenty thousand dollars that's about it so he's just saying that making millions i mean less than  that you're trying to make it more interesting parker should have made a deal with you guys  and he tell he says in the book scotty moore you we're talking with dj fontana ladies and gentlemen  elvis is the original drummer and great to see d but he taught he says scotty says in the book 
[00:10:00]  that uh colonel parker went behind their backs was trying to get hank's nose band to back them on the road  he was back elvis he was and they said they weren't gonna go for it and then uh elvis said  he heard about he hit the ceiling too he did but i mean you know that's not cool well that's not  different type bands completely yeah yeah it was a bluegrass yeah yeah precisely rock and roll band  and they said you know and then i guess there's an audience for this i don't know i'm fascinated 
[00:10:30]  quite frankly elvis's original drummer i didn't even know there were drums in elvis's songs  in the book he mentions it all the time in the early years or the later years i used to ask scotty  about it he said oh gk uh we asked uh elvis and elvis said go see the colonel you know and uh it was  about that one percent see jim elvis was going to give scotty dj and bill one percent of everything  he made now that sounds like a small amount but that's a lot oh we figured out money we figured 
[00:11:00]  out about two million dollars wow that one percent would have come to more money than scotty made in  a year with elvis as far as you know every year wow elvis wanted they're not even talking with  scotty they're talking about scotty right and it's so funny because they have to turn it around  to make sure everybody knows that they're saying the colonel was the bad guy not elvis they never  bash elvis don't you disrespect the king elvis wanted to uh elvis wanted to give him the two  million dollars but he said he said talk to the colonel the colonel gave him a hard time i'm 
[00:11:30]  obsessed with the elvis stories on the elvis channel because they go nowhere yeah it's just  some weird weird connection to elvis presley this one's just on pause we can listen to the rest of  it oh please okay i want to hear who are they talking to the original drummer no they're talking  about the original drummer and they're talking to him though they're talking to him i i didn't hear  him and maybe he's in there somewhere i thought he was one of those guys and then what uh some guy  that did elvis's taxes once or something is writing a book about that i i i don't know 
[00:12:00]  i have no idea what they're actually talking about he shut down everything we were driving out of  california me scotty and bill and this guy we had the yellow cadillac then the one we had in canada  the yellow cadillac limousine yeah and uh so uh this guy pulled us over and he told who you were  and i said yeah that's that's uh pull over here at this restaurant i want to talk to you so he said 
[00:12:30]  i'll tell you what i'll do guys i'll give you everybody a brand new lincoln he was gonna give  his lincoln what wow i said well i'll take one and he said well elvis has got to be involved in  this thing he said well i don't know about that yeah well the colonel shot that down too he didn't  god damn piece of shit he won't allow everyone to get a lincoln no yeah he's gonna give elvis one  yeah just oh man and he said no i want everybody well why wouldn't the colonel do it well you know

[00:27:00]  doing a show at wmc elvis calls me he said gk where's cliff i said he's sitting right here with  him in the control room elvis he said tell him get out memphis and national airport got a ticket  for him want him to come to sit in the audience here at the ed sullivan show and man cliff went  nuts he was up there man he said the ed sullivan show shouldn't run the audience you know that's  amazing he was the best that's amazing no it's not not that amazing he was in the audience of the  ed sullivan show it's not amazing it's not an amazing story obviously new cliff and said hey 
[00:27:30]  man i'm gonna be on ed sullivan i want you to be here once you're there that's not amazing that's  amazing it would have it would have been amazing if he was on the ed sullivan show right right not in  the crowd it's not but this is the caliber of stories that they're at because this is this is  exactly what you hear on the elvis channel these types man they're so far removed from anything  oh yeah they realize like six weeks into the elvis channel oh no right we've run out of elvis stories 
[00:28:00]  you want to keep going oh yeah all right notice i ever saw he's very good very good he was as good  as some of those hollywood guys wouldn't he oh they wasn't nothing our guest is dj fontana ladies and  gentlemen legendary drummer he's in the rock and roll hall of fame the rock and roll hall of fame  yes in cleveland ohio he was elvis's original drummer and a terrific guy and this is his wife  karen over here they're all good friends of mine and jim this is you know what original drummer means 
[00:28:30]  right oh god pete best kind of right elvis was like uh we gotta get a new drummer yeah yeah that's  what original drummer means yeah yeah because you could just say the drummer but you have to say  original drummer that means there was a problem there and they had to move on to a better drummer  he's the drummer on the demos and that's it i don't even know anything about elvis and i  would assume that's why he uh didn't stay with elvis his drumming was lackluster hey colonel 
[00:29:00]  why don't you fire that uh drummer right we need another new drummer now it sounds like we're about  to hear about dj fontana the original drummer's wife wife yeah now he's gonna talk about the wife  yeah what does that have to do with elvis no well because her husband was once drumming for elvis and  the colonel only gave him eighteen thousand dollars and no lincoln oh yeah oh that's the  guy that didn't get the link two million bucks and a lincoln and and some cool blazers but did he  get the coat i don't think he got one of the original drummer didn't get the coat what are you sure

[00:30:30]  like you know i i just want to you know but uh hey how many people here from out of town you guys  from out of town yeah my friend cliff one time we broke down all of a sudden i'm like i'm going out  of memphis but seriously any birthdays yeah anybody here have a sports coat that you want to have a  little joke about anybody here have a coat that oh shit all right what are we gonna learn now one  more please i gotta have one more half more all right we're starting to move into the  wrestle drummer's wife yes okay big jr my bodyguard back here got me a bodyguard now

[00:35:30]  country music with blues what and d and scotty and dj was playing the two guitars that originated  now that they go into the song that would be like what you would do right of course  i call i call uh what's his name uh he got it owns uh rolling stone magazine sean werner john  werner because i met him when i was up in new york when elvis went to rock and roll the thing 
[00:36:00]  and i said look i got this picture look great on the cover of your paper especially with elvis  coming up he didn't even call me back man golly call me he didn't even call me back man yeah i had  the biggest in the kernel yeah he had uh he had liberaci's original uh piano seat it's a coat rack  oh my god this is fucking he just told the story of the time he didn't talk to the guy who runs 
[00:36:30]  rolling stone magazine right well yeah you gotta say that yeah and and it was a good story because  the other guy said golly so golly they're doing something right golly man yeah all right are we done  i i i kind of want to get to the end of this yeah i want to see how they go into a song when do they  go into a song do they go into a try a little more we might be going too far now with this shit  let's get to our magazine that they should have that that they the one should have went for they 
[00:37:00]  didn't call me back oh i have a rule dj fontana i will call people three times they don't call me  back i don't call them anymore oh never call and you know what i say to them i'll see a dude and i call  him three times i may be seeing him a year later and i say man did you ever get that phone fixed  he said what you talking about i said i called you three times you never called me back man  oh man i was out of town oh man yeah they have a million excuses now it takes two minutes to  return the phone wait a minute hold on he just downgraded his excuses by 999 000 
[00:37:30]  i heard he said he had a million excuses the other guy comes back with a thousand he sliced his  excuses by by a thousandth of what they should have been he gave them that's crazy man many excuses  i'll give you a thousand i bet you i bet you can't come over in five no and that excuse that was  terrible you're getting that phone fixed what do you mean man what do you mean man trying to call  you oh that was worth telling on the radio what do you mean man they will tell any story that's my 
[00:38:00]  point they will just tell any story that's my point exactly what do we do now who knew this was  you want to play i want to find out how they go into a song and when did it go into a song it's  elvis radio he's a singer all right let's go crazy i talk too much dj no you don't dj fontana man  karen he brings about so many wonderful memories out there in seattle washington like this one  the coma washington oh whoa whoa whoa standing there with me and dj colonel parker walks up and 
[00:38:30]  i said colonel we're playing outside what happens if it rains another story yeah dj's yeah colonel  what happens if it rains he said we don't have any problem i said what do you mean he said we got a  contract that we were able to sail the raincoats oh he probably did yeah that's colonel parker for  you he was a trip man what did he say he was he's a character but he never gave you guys any  dj doesn't talk no no no he doesn't talk one interesting story but you guys are smart y'all  went over to the knickerbock hotel that's right we stayed at the uh i'll tell you why dj's keep 
[00:39:00]  points here's why dj's got nothing i think dj's the one who was with elvis when he broke down  so dj really knew elvis so this is like listening to people tell patrice stories about yeah my friend  worked in a club one time patrice he ordered diet coke but there was no ice right right we would have  nothing to chime in with nothing because we know the real story this guy dj probably saw elvis get  his dick sucked he's got some good stories he could probably tell you when i said elvis if you're 
[00:39:30]  gonna fuck her in the ass you don't put it in her mouth after oh man elvis cracked her head up with  the guitar you know how elvis was now that's amazing you know how elvis was yeah elvis took a fried  banana peanut butter sandwich and mushed it in her face it's an iron sign and shit you fat bitch  dj knows the real stories but he can't tell them so he's got to listen to these fucking inane babble  he'll just chime in yeah yeah my that's a lot of lip a lot of hearsay on this channel a lot of 
[00:40:00]  inadmissible evidence dj is the guy you want to talk to has a few belts but gk wants to be the  expert so he's not even asking dj questions he's just like dj you sit there and listen to some of  my you know how he was dj because one time we was there at the knickerbocker hotel yeah and yeah  that's what he does he just kind of because the colonel you know he didn't like no raincoats and  i don't know how the colonel was and then dj wants to chime in i sure do i once watched him  burn an infant alive for a dollar fifty there was a baby and someone said i'll give you a dollar 
[00:40:30]  fifty to burn that baby alive and he did it and elvis laughed he had a good laugh didn't he oh yes  he laughed a lot dj has the real stories oh he's got great stories get dj drunk and get him on this  fucking job oh man all right push play all right i think we're back in knickerbocker what's that hotel  on beverly hills beverly wilshire yes we stayed there all the stars yeah we you you never went  over there did you know we knew better i know why you didn't come over there i finally got scotty 
[00:41:00]  and bill to tell me dj wouldn't tell me karen i can't tell you tell you why he's why you're here  yeah just the way the colonel was yeah i know it and we don't have to outrun him every night  no i know about some kind of deal yeah you know so we stayed away from him say right there was  dj knows he doesn't want to say anything because dj knows the colonel and his deals right  the colonel with a raincoat and he wants to go yeah well how about the time the colonel 
[00:41:30]  brought over those 11 year old girls who said uh you give me 35 dollars i'll let you come in  her hair before send her home under 35 dollars i ain't got but 12 he said well then you can own  the 23. yeah that was a good one oh my god oh dj's got the real story oh dj knows everything man  he was with elvis when he broke they ran out of gas with elvis in the car yeah come on he had a  jalopy more sam oh yeah i guess right let's go all right a little more we're in the shit i gotta 
[00:42:00]  know about the hotels in hollywood now yeah yeah beverly wilshire right hear anything on stage no  no no do you ever tell a band what to do he didn't know anything left you alone though  well he didn't i love it he didn't know any better he didn't know he didn't know ladies and  gentlemen outside of our studio they're watching this broadcast d these are this is the original  rock and roll drummer from elvis's group the dj was elvis's first drummer was with him remember  he's the 68 special where he's in that little square circle with a leather suit that's dj up there on 
[00:42:30]  stage playing with him and also dj he originated that great lick give me that lick from chill  house rock uh he originally this is dj yeah we got on they don't got better than past tape man  he got on something else now this is dj originating that lick he's just hitting the snare yeah  all right now yeah also the guitar is probably the star of that moment yeah that's the guitar  he's going he originated that wow he originated that fucking yeah yeah john bonham man you could 
[00:43:00]  have been the guy and why is why is dj perplexed that at the elvis radio channel they have a recording  of jailhouse rock yeah yeah you got that one e-rock where is that he's got his own version of e-rock  play that one and you just hear from the control room all shit well crap well crap oh my god time we 
[00:43:30]  asked e-rock to find that clip and he did no oh he's always doing that oh you know that e-rock you know  e-rock right yeah yeah yeah if it wasn't bikini girls it was fan fiction always doing something  getting things signed for charity yeah yeah yeah remember his mouth remember that time we was talking  about e-rock movie it's a long movie let me tell you about this it's a long movie it's about uh five  decades long but it's only going to be 90 minutes well he was the original hoodie footed salesman 
[00:44:00]  e-rock scammed out of some hoodie footers for charity you think they would have brought up the charity  everything he got my son he get things signed said he's going to sell it for katrina victims and  they said why are we signing it to e-rock oh you know e-rock right you know him he said it'd make it  more valuable you know how he would oh yeah e-rock were hanging out over there uh with the colonel  no no sanders colonel sanders because he lacked the kfc yeah and he said give me a bucket 
[00:44:30]  that's the whole story  well now they're going to break down jailhouse rock and that part that was the drummer that's  that's this man he came up with that lick came up with that lick maybe the least impressive  drumming on any elvis song yeah absolutely it's the guitar that makes that  yeah exactly here's the fiddle player you can't hear him but i think that's the first noise a kid 
[00:45:00]  makes yeah there wasn't even anything not even a little right i go back to gentlemen but dj fontan  this guy right here d i used to i said dj what's this time for he said don juan yeah i know don joseph  i finally found out here but he originated also the rock and roll licking hound dog give me that  lick from hound dog jim four three two one hit it d four three two one oh i got a live version of

[00:58:00]  i remember 1965 when the supremes came in and you'd like filter it into a voice i remember when diana  would come in and she's very nice and bought me coffee but we'd say nothing uh-huh like about  the charts or you know the songwriters who was it a joke or a lie it was just it was fabrication  and you know one of the monsters one of the uh motown musicians recalls working with marvin gay 
[00:58:30]  i remember marvin gay was a nice man and he would bring me lunch and that would be the cut but it never  happened exactly oh and it was all the only voices that's not the other mind that's  shit you were fabricated you're lying to the audience you'd go outside with a cassette and  record it in the hallway or something just to get you know some different audio some ambient people  are suggesting that you should replace your real voice with that voice yes yeah your voice is so  awful and maybe then you'll get a full-time shift yes sam is that you sending that uh tweet 
[00:59:00]  that story brought out rage in me the great radio guys have been doing that to the public for years  it's theater of the mind i understand that but that's mindless they don't take when you think  you're being told the truth and it's a blatant lie it's a lie radio guys have been lying forever man  like somebody heard that and went and told their office mate you know oh yeah i heard a guy who got  marvin gay a sandwich and they were wrong they were lying right yeah it might have happened i was  backstage and i seen the pips walk by with the gladdest knight and uh and they actually waved 
[00:59:30]  to me they're very nice gentlemen exactly that would be it exactly you know right into her through  the grapevine right about the elvis story what's that i thought you had an elvis story well i had  stories similar to that i remember the elvis story that that i always remember when he was supposed  to play uh in 1977 yes when i was uh driving home at westbury music fair i believe coliseum  oh well somewhere i think he could do a bit bigger than a 3 000 seat arena i think he was 
[01:00:00]  playing at westbury i think my aunt my aunt had tickets to see him at westbury music fair and i  remember there was a station in new york uh that pat st john worked at wplj when they were still a rock  station all of a sudden in the afternoon they were playing elvis oh and you knew something was up  because they were breaking format oh boy oh boy breaking the phone said why you know why because they  were in new york's best rock rock was it flush the format did they do a flush the format that day  no that was scott shannon's thing scott shannon front to format you got crazy

[01:15:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back  Go on, sit down  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more 
[01:16:00]  You got to know when to hold up  Know when to fold up  Know when to walk away  Does this have a theme?  To cleanse the palate  Oh, cleanse the palate with this?  I used to like the Kenny Rogers Roaster  Oh, right  Remember that was around?  What was the name of his joint?  Was it called that?  Kenny Rogers  As seen on Seinfeld  Yes  Very funny Seinfeld 
[01:16:30]  Fuck, did he have good chicken?  The stuffing was great  I loved Kenny Rogers Roasters  Yeah  What happened to that?  Bankrupt  They went bankrupt?  How do you go bankrupt serving fried chicken?  That's impossible  Well, apparently not  OTB should have never went belly up  And Kenny Rogers Roasters  How do you fuck that up, right?  You got the celebrity name  You got the chicken  You got the mashed potatoes and the gravy  People liked it, too 
[01:17:00]  It was some good stuff  Kenny Rogers  75 years old today  Although his face is only about 10 years old  Yeah, he did some  Give me a picture of Kenny Rogers, please  Old and new  You should see him performing on Jimmy Fallon not too long ago  With the Roots doing this  Right  It's weird  Yeah  Oh my god  Why would you do that?  Look at his eyes  He always had those squinty eyes  And now he's got wide open eyes  And now they're all open real wide 
[01:17:30]  He was aging fine  Why do people do this shit?  He may have had work done at that first picture  You never know  That may have been like after a little bit of work  We've had this discussion  I understand people get a little something something done  But then you gotta know when to fucking stop  You gotta know when to hold him  Right  There's still a lot  Play 75  Yeah  Are there any older pictures of him?  So you could see like  Yeah, okay, okay  Go all the way to the left  Oh no, that ain't it 
[01:18:00]  All the way  Oh boy, what happened?  No, all the way to the left  Down, down  The one in the corner  No, no, the other corner  Yeah, that one  Cause that looks like  He's still got some gray  Right  Oh wow, yeah  His eyes are wide  His eyes  He probably can't close his eyes when he sleeps  Oh man  I don't think he looks that bad though  It's like  Ah, you gotta see the video of him  His face doesn't really move  Oh no  That's what it's always  Looks like they're talking through a mask 
[01:18:30]  I like Coward of the County  Did they all rape Becky  They rape her?  Yeah  Jesus  But he didn't do anything?  Oh yeah, no, he did  He went in there  And he fucking thought of his daddy's picture  And he beat those guys up in a bar  Oh  And his tears fell on his daddy's face  As he heard his daddy's words again  Why was he the Coward of the County?  That's because he was yellow  But he helped  No, but that was  I don't know  Eric  What?  Can we hear that? 
[01:19:00]  Oh my god  Wait, don't say what  All right  Can we hear it?  Yes  They love it  Thank you  That's my favorite thing  It really is one of my favoritest things ever  All the radio shows would lose their minds  When there's little fuck-ups  We love them  You ever heard this?  Of course  Oh  Turn it up a little bit  The Coward of the County wrong  Coward 
[01:19:30]  His mama named him Tommy  The folks just called him Yellow  Chicken shit  Yeah  Hey, Yellow  Yellow  Oof  I don't know that  They were reading Tommy wrong  Oh  He kind of sensed it  You got to know  Storytelling  I hate storytelling  I love a good story  This is nephew Tommy  His dad died  He's 10  What are you doing?  Story 
[01:20:00]  Telling his story  Story  Now drink some of this combo  Not to cover your dick in dung  It don't mean you're weak  If you open up those cheeks  Son, you don't have to be a top to be a man 
[01:20:30]  Put your face in the pillow  And take it in the can  I like Jimmy's version  Oh, the story's building now  Tommy loved Becky  She was a nice girl  Ah, right  In her arms  He didn't have to prove he was a man  That's right  Because she would fucking put him face down  And strap it on  Fucking cuck  The Gatlin boys came calling  Oh, Gatlin boys  Oh, boy  They took turns at Becky  Whoa 
[01:21:00]  There was three of them  Oh, getting back  Who let go first?  Third  So is Becky playing with her clips?  Uh-oh  Grabbed her  Coggy blade  The shattered look  Was more than he could stand  Oh  He reached above the fireplace  And took down his daddy's picture  It's good that he didn't call the ambulance for Becky  Having a maritalin moment with his father's photo  While she's bleeding out of the cunt and ass 
[01:21:30]  He's waxing melancholy  She's there with her teeth missing in the rug  Now I understand the song  The father didn't want him fighting  Yes  So he didn't fight  And they called him a coward  But he just knew he didn't have to fight to be a man  But this now  Yeah, which is ironic  Because his father was in jail for child pornography  See, Tommy walked in there 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah  One of them got up  And met him halfway across the floor  Oh, boy  Yeah  This is good  When Tommy turned around  They said  Hey, look, old yellow's leaving  Uh-huh  But you could have heard a pin drop  When Tommy stopped and locked the door  Oh, shit  Oh, shit  It was going down  20 years of crawling  Was bottled up inside  Oh, man  These guys are fucked 
[01:22:30]  He wasn't holding nothing back  He let them have it all  He's just fucking fucking him in the ass  Yeah  He's like  Oh, bottled up  He had a cock in each hand  One in his ass  Sucking  Tugging  Grabbing  Sucking  Cogging  He'd make them cum in his hand  And he'd eat it out  Like a fucking small deer  Like a horse on a salt lake  Now, please don't think 
[01:23:00]  I put two of them between my cheeks  Oh, yeah  Sometimes you gotta fight  Ah, sometimes you gotta fight  You haven't figured it out  In the head, right  It changed all around  Yeah  The story continues  Oh, okay  I like the fact that the Gatlin boys raped his wife  And then as he comes in and turns around  They go  Hey, look, old yellow's leaving  Yeah  Oh, Jesus  What dicks  Really bad guys 
[01:23:30]  Met him across the floor  Yeah  Guy just walks in for a drink  After his wife's been raped  And the rapists are there  And they go  Hey, yellow's leaving  Oh, God  Jesus  But they really were pushing it  With him  Yeah, the Gatlin boys really did ask for fucking trouble  Tommy locked the door  But it was a swinging, okay, saloon door  They just leave  Tommy stopped  Call him yellow again  Locked the door  But meanwhile, there's a lot of other people  That want to leave  And they can't  He locked the door 
[01:24:00]  And they set a fire  Like the Happyland disco  There you go  Kenny Rogers, 75  And our favorite MILF  Kim Cattrall  Oh, no  Is she officially a MILF?  I don't even know  Well  Well  It's my birthday  Oh  57 today  Oh  Maybe for my birthday  I'm going to have three guys  One in every hole  Oh  Then my husband will come home 
[01:24:30]  And find me with a torn dress  And a shattered look  And then cry on his father's picture  Oh, the coward of the county's home  I would have had no problem with that  He'll cry on his dad's picture  As I'm sewing my vaginal lips back on  Yuck  Fucking theme  I couldn't hit the fucking channel changer quick enough  You don't like this show?

[01:31:30]  Their lips look like a dried out river bed  You know this is the problem there  Yeah, me too, me too  But when you're sitting in an audience and there's 300 of them  And they're all screaming, that's me, that's me  And all of a sudden you know that they're not alone out there  And I get e-mails all the time  That's when I watch fucking Nazi documentaries  That's me  And I'm taking my husband so he understands what I'm going through  Change, change, change, change, change, change, change a lot  They got the sassy black woman  Right  And then the varying ages 
[01:32:00]  Probably the most important thing to know about my show is  Menopause the Musical was never written to be about theater  Let's face it, it's not Macbeth  Menopause the Musical was written to be about women  And the great thing about it is across the country women get it  The critics on the other hand have no clue  And they give out little fans  They give out those little fans  So they can fan themselves in the audience when they get their hot flashes  No matter what they say about it in their reviews  They have to finish it off by saying  Look at the audience, it's just old house frows  They laugh, and you're right there  They're talking about what you're going through 
[01:32:30]  And it was just, it was great, it was great  I lived in New York and I saw all the Broadway shows  It's even better than that  What shows did you see?  Finally we have something that recognizes women's problems  Women's growth  Women's growth  Independence  Exactly  Give it a fucking mammogram  I'm just so tired of not sleeping  Uh-oh, here it is  Well, you can tell by the way I slump my walk 
[01:33:00]  I'm a tired girl, no strength to talk  In the mirror, my eyes so red  I've been up all night, sitting in my bed  That's not all that, that's not okay  My mood is dry, I should be dead  The other way, my husband tries to understand  Just no concept for a man  My country is dry and I'm really cranky  Just put a gun in my mouth  Put a gun in my mouth  I was on the Star Show three years ago  When I was actually at the start of menopause  So it has helped me just to deal with it 
[01:33:30]  And just to know that it's something that everybody else in the whole world has or is going through  Or will go through  And that's the way the audience is too  Everyone out there has maybe a mother, a wife, a sister, somebody  That is going through menopause or has  It helps the younger ones understand mom better  It helps husbands understand their wives better  Here's what happens to your vagina  And while we're laughing, you know the old adage  Laughter is the best medicine  Really, really works with this show 
[01:34:00]  Mommy, what's menopause?  Alright, let me peel this apple and leave it out for a week  It's a little demonstration  Staying awake, staying awake  See the summer's breaking and you're up  Hoping bacon and you're staying awake, staying awake  Those first few shows, we were astounded every night at the things that people loved  That we thought were great  But we didn't know how great they were  Until we got the response from the audience  Why? Why is this video so long?  It's forever  I'd rather go back to the Elvis channel 
[01:34:30]  Sweet Sweaty Woman  Come on  Is this the one you were looking at online?  Oh yeah  I was fascinated  Of course  Night sweating  Because we bring together all the things that happen to women  The choreography is terrific  Oh, isn't it?  I hate to smell that wardrobe  But they're done for a couple of command performances  It's definitely  Oh, you had that too?  Oh, that happens to me  Does that happen to you?  Alright  It happens to me  Yeah, we get it  Exactly  I don't like any black woman with hair like David Cassidy 
[01:35:00]  Might as well celebrate it  She's awful  It's my cunt  It's dry and it's awful and it smells like a horse's gum  These are teeny twiggy matrons as we call them in our songs  Jesus  All my cast members are  When we do our calls  They're 40 years and above  And they're in size 10 and above  So that they can relate to exactly what they're talking about  Yes, they're not going to hire any, you know, thin actresses for this 
[01:35:30]  Oh, look at that audience  One of the fun things is watching the men come to the show  Because there's a guy there, yeah  This fucking cut asleep  Yeah, this pussy that got dragged to this  Reaching for the fucking trigger with his toe right now  Oh, that poor guy  He's like, yeah, fuck with Penn and Teller  I don't want to go see them  I'll go see fucking Menopause, the musical  Exactly  For a few minutes  Felt like the minority in there  But it was a very great performance  Very funny  And I'm glad I came  There's a lot of words I don't understand 
[01:36:00]  I was sitting there thinking  What are they laughing about?  You mean nothing dries up?  I elbowed my wife at her one good breast  And I said, remember what happened to you, honey?  Oh, God, she's singing to a guy in the audience  Yeah, she's getting all sexy with a guy in the audience  That's great  She sits on a colostomy  It's the only lubrication she's had  Old guy just came in his pants 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah  I'm not the only one  Wow  I had a great time  I felt like I died  And going to heaven there for a minute  Wow, that'll be happening soon  And we can even see them in the audience  Sometimes, you know, the men will start out  You know, thinking, okay  Jerking off  Yeah, then we show up  And their dicks actually leap off their bodies  And jump down the sewer  And about halfway through the show 
[01:37:00]  And about halfway through the show  They're nudging the wife  And that's you up there  And, you know, laughing  Yeah, imagine that  And sometimes we can hear the men over the women  Because they recognize their wives  Oh, my God, they're still talking about it  Still  It's like  It's like they're talking about  Les Mis on Broadway  This is actually off the strip  It's at the Pig Hotel  This whole promo could be  Our cunts are dry  We're going to sing about it  Yeah  That's the theme of the hotel  It's menopause  Every machine  It's like an old crinkly arm  Instead of a fucking  Slot handle 
[01:37:30]  And the fucking thing  That the money comes out of  Is like a dried vagina  And you never win anything  There's always dried cherries  Oh, my God  Is that the women who come  For the first time  When they come back again  And they usually do  They come back with other people  They don't just send people to the show  They bring people to the show  Oh, you've got to  It's something that I think  I would want to come back  And see several times  Two bottles of water  One for a mouth  One for a cunt  There's so much there  That you want to keep seeing 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  Seeing it and picking up  The nuances that you've missed  The nuances  And it's like a mirror  You see yourself  You see what you've got  It's a woman who will say  Bob Euchre  Absolutely  This is the third time for me  Oh, boy  Every time I do something different  Do you?  Menopause, the musical  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen  Yeah  Menopause before they go in there  Take it over, dummies  Oh, horrible  Man 
[01:38:30]  I was fascinated with it  Every time we drove down  What was it?  Tropicana or something  They just had that billboard  It was all lit up  And it was like  This woman's laughing  This post-menopausal woman  Just laughing  With the big funny lettering  Menopause, the musical  We get out of the tub in  The shining  The shining  We got a guy on the line  That lost his job  Over menopause, the musical  How does that happen?  There's no way 
[01:39:00]  Okay  Prostate cancer  The musical director  In here  It got run out of dodge  By that new hot show  Nate in Chicago  Nate in Chicago  Amen  I was doing Second City  In Cleveland  We had a Second City  In Cleveland  For a few brief years  Yeah  And they called us in  For a meeting one morning  And we were all excited  Thought we were getting  A new director  And they started the meeting  Off by saying  You're selling more tickets  Than ever before  But the board's full on the plug  And we're replacing you  With menopause, the musical 
[01:39:30]  Oh, God  Wow  So they threw you guys out  So it hit the road  Yeah  We had 30 days left  We had to finish out our show  And they said 75%  Of all theater goers  Are females  So  Of course they're out  Much better  Yeah  I'm writing my new show  Ovarian fibroid tumors  The comedy  That's fascinating  Thank you  Sign the Wayans brothers  As the tumors  Stevie Knight  Who's a good egg  On the Twitter  Tweets 
[01:40:00]  Alternate title  The dead vagina  Monologue  How did we miss that one  Oh, that's fucking  It's gotta be horrible  Womb like a paper bag  Like a brown paper bag  And you could hear it crinkling  Yeah, if you're hyperventilating  You had to put your face  In her crotch  All the fucking  Woman organs  Are like Chex Mix  At that point  Just fucking  That's terrible 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, when she jumps up  And down the inside  Of her rattles  Like a fucking  Like a bowl of  Those fucking  Goldfish food  Shucka, shucka, shucka, shucka  Shucka, shucka  Oh, you poor bitches  God  He thought that was bad  Yeah  Oh, man  Denny's Radio Jingle Package  Nice  Did he handpick these? 
[01:41:00]  No  Well, these are the jingles  He really, really likes  That he had to collect  But yeah  He had to collect  And trade for them  Right, right, right  What made that any different  Than any other jingle?  I don't know  Maybe he could come in here  And explain quickly  I mean  Fucking email the explanation  To Sam  He'll read it  K-I-L-T  What's good about that? 
[01:41:30]  He collects these  Like, why is that better  Than anything else?

Well, yeah  Because WPIX FM in New York  Used to use that one  And you could  The top of the hour jingle

They were great  I love the 90s  Excellent too  K-A-K-C  You collected that 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, it was nice  No, it's not  I just like the vocal  I like the W-A-B-C chime one  That's probably one of the most popular  Jingles of all time  Number five  W-A-B-C  W-A-B-C chime time  You know  Chime, chime time  Why?  Oh, boy  And the 99X shotgun  That was the only jingle they used  That was a great one  I listened to 99X growing up  Yeah, it was a great jingle  99X  Just love the drums  Where's the shotgun? 
[01:43:30]  Well, that's what it's called  It's called a shotgun jingle  Unfortunately not in his mouth  Exactly  Should be a fucking shotgun  When they run out of Lavoris  CKLW is a great station  Why do you have these?  I have no concept of why you would  When would you listen to these?  Like, what would your other option be?  Maybe Friday night when you go off the air  You'd have an air checks and jingle party  With the other jocks  Jingle party  I'd rather go to a lemon party  I'd rather go to a fucking  Say this cartel party 
[01:44:00]  Is the guest of honor  You know, and we'd trade them  Hey, do you have anything from  You know, from California  Or anything from Chicago  I'm looking for WLS or something  I'm asked a lot  If you're a bit  And I have to tell people  Over and over again  That you're not a bit  I love this stuff  But you  Now I think you're fucking  No, no, I'm not  You've never had a jingle party  Oh, yeah  The guys would get  Back in the 70s  You know, when you're younger  Or something  How does that discussion come up?  What goes on?  What goes on at a jingle party?  We're going to get together Friday night  You know, you want to pass  Friday night? 
[01:44:30]  Maybe a Tuesday  He said when you were younger, though  Yeah, yeah  So it's like, you know  When you're younger  That's the type of stuff  You're going to do on a Friday night  If you're not fucking a woman  Do you want to come over  And listen to FM  Tongue  You know, pick up a pizza  Go through some jingles  I'll trade you or something  But you know, when you get  A party together  You go, alright  What are you bringing?  So in this case, what?  I'm bringing the WABC jingle  What are you going?  What are you bringing  To the jingle party?  I got something special for you  I got some great stuff  From KING Seattle  What?

[01:45:00]  On the floor  After Bill stinks it up  With a good shit  We're going to open  A hornet's nest  And get stung  While breathing  In this shit  And back then  These guys don't  Take this seriously  I don't know  Why?  We've never taken  Radio seriously  Broadcasting  And you see  Back then  You only had this stuff  On cassette  Or reel-to-reel  Of course  And you'd rack them up  On the big Ampex machine  It should have never been  On cassette or reel-to-reel  No, no  It's a great stuff  There should be 
[01:45:30]  And matter of fact  Jonathan Wolford  From Jams  And Pam  He has a 10 volume set  CD that you can buy  Really?  It's great  How much is it?  I think a couple hundred dollars  Maybe 99 bucks  I remember a friend of mine  99 bucks?  His wife got it for him  For his 50th birthday party  For his 50th birthday  And he was like excited  I can't believe she got me  Yeah, exactly  What a bitch  Jesus, horrible  And it's got all the  WABC jingles  All the different packages  Alright, but you're  At the jingle party  Then what?  You all take turns  Playing what you found?  Yeah  What do you got?  Oh, I got something 
[01:46:00]  From Chicago  Was there beer at least?  Yeah, you got beer  Oh, yeah  Things were crazy  Crazy  How many beers  Could you drink  At a single  Jingle party?  It wasn't about  Getting drunk  It was about  What you went home with  Before you got there  Just to get through it  I've been looking  For something from  Maybe a Canadian radio station  Do you have anything?  Oh, yeah  We've got something for you  Just have these  W-B-O-R-E  I'm kidding  There's a lot of  Jingle freaks out there  No, there are  No, there are  That's a terrible party 
[01:46:30]  On a Friday night  I get it  Let's go to Dale in Texas  Dale  Dale  That's my friend  Danny, did you ever  Send away for any of the  Live baby chicks  That some of the stations  Used to give away?  No, I never did that  What's that?  Do you even know, Danny?  That doesn't sound good  What's that about, Dale?  Sounds mean  Well, they used to give away  Or you could buy them  You could buy like  A hundred or five hundred  Baby chicks  For a very low price  It was a radio giveaway  I mean, don't you guys 
[01:47:00]  Ever remember talking to  Lee Abrams about radio history?  Yeah, of course  Yeah, Lee was a good guy  To talk to him  Yeah, Lee was great  But he knew it was terrible  Yeah, that's why he wanted  To do things differently  He hated all this stuff  Oh, yeah  And the company hated him  And said, beat it  Yeah  That was smart, huh?  Yeah, but these things  Are just fun  Do you miss that that  Doesn't happen in radio anymore?  That there are  Well, you know  It was part of listener  You know, just recalling  The station  People would sing the jingle  After a while  It would just be ingrained  In their head  W-A-B-C 
[01:47:30]  Boom, you know  W-H-B-Q  It would just be ingrained  In their heads  Fine, but you don't need  To collect  It was part of the fabric  W-H-B-Q  We have jingle parties  At Anthony's house  Except instead of playing jingles  There's one man drinking alcohol  And doing Michael Richards  Laugh Factory  In the swimming pool  I mean, look  A lot of guys collected  Baseball cards  Comic books  Figures or something  Things that are worth money  Yeah, exactly  But the party atmosphere  I'm amazed by it  E-Rock, do you have  The famous Opie and Anthony jingle? 
[01:48:00]  There can't be that many people  To have a party  In death  Do you miss it?  Jocks at the radio  I wish they had  Like the Heaven's Gate party  Brad Dump had a better party  In his bedroom  With a hibachi  I mean, to this day  A buddy of mine  Will send me an air check  You know  An email  Hey, I got a great air check  Of, you know  Opie or something  When he worked at  Things like that  But the young camaraderie  Is not there anymore  Right, because unfortunately  There's not a lot of jocks  At radio stations anymore  No  Wait, where's our  The voice track  I'm trying to play 
[01:48:30]  Our great jingle  Well, play the one you found  E-Rock  But I'm  This is great  Oh, I got it  Jam song?  I got it  But this is the greatest  But this is the greatest jingle  Of all time right here  Opie  Anthony  And Norton too  Good times 
[01:49:00]  Great hits  XF202  Suck my fucking cock  Would it be nice  If you had some females in there  Maybe a five or seven  Member female group  Oh, yeah, yeah  Because you could order  The jingles too  Do you want five guys  Do you want three women  To sing  Do you want seven voices  Suck my fucking cock  Oh, that could work, Sam  See  What I love about the show  You never know  Where this shit's going  We're just on a little ride  Every morning  Oh, sure  We've got to bring back  The jingle contest  That was a lot of fun 
[01:49:30]  We weren't thinking  About the jingle contest  And now I'm thinking  We've got to bring it back  We had so much trouble though  Because so many people  Mistake it for a song  Pair contest  Right, right  And they make songs  Because they don't know  What jingles are  You have to tell them  A limit on it  You have to give them  A time limit  Yes  Five, ten seconds  Ten seconds  Tops  The best jingles  Are the shortest ones  This is a ten second contest  And it's jingles  Like this  W-R-K-O  Boston  Oh, yeah  Those are great voices  Those are great voices 
[01:50:00]  Who cares  But it's who cares  You like the smooth jingle voice  I love the K-I-L tilt  That's great  You guys would get through  This awful  Like that moment right there  What would you do at the party  All right, here it goes  Hold on, hold on  Listen to this  There you go  And you'd play  J-Y-N-O  Fresno  It's like being in Fresno  Yeah  Exactly  You're there  It sounded like the Boston one  Yeah  Well, that's it  Because you could get  You know, you'd listen to it  You'd work at some small station  Say, gee, I want the jingle  Just like that  And then you fucking rip them off  Because radio's filled with assholes 
[01:50:30]  That just rip off other guys  They steal other people's shit  Fuck them all  Like Elvis did  I mean  A-C-C-L  Sacramento  So did you kind of realize  That they're all the same  And none of them  Have any local character whatsoever?  Should they say the town in there?  That's your local flavor  Some jingles would  You know, I mean  I think WYNY New York  Back in the 70s  Had a package geared for New York  But the songs went on too long  Uh-huh  Driving along  Singing a song with a friend  You're stopping for coffee  You're playing the songs 
[01:51:00]  After a while  It just became annoying  Short jingles quick  What do they have?  The one on 60s  On 6, I guess it is  About turning over  You gotta turn so you don't burn  Oh, turn to burn  Yeah, on the beach  You'd hear it  And it'd be like  You know, turn so you don't burn  Roll your bod  Yeah, and you'd be like  Oh!  See, that's a jingle thing  But it also helps  The people listening at the beach  Yes, it does  It reminds them like  Oh, shit, I better turn over  I just love that K-I-L-T one  Boy, I could play that one 
[01:51:30]  Boy, he loves that  That's the one with that talk up there  Right in the beginning  When you could just talk it up  Hey, coming up after  Opie and Anthony today  It's Jim Norton  So make sure you stay here  On the O&A channel, baby  We got it  Can I talk  Can I talk one up  Can I do the K-I-L-T one  Sure, Jimmy  You sure can  I don't think this is  Going to be nice  We're going to play  Gladys Knight's song  And fake like we know  A Negro from her band  We're liars  There you go  See, you got it  You nailed it  You should be doing  Some Shotgun Radio  That's called Shotgun Radio 
[01:52:00]  I could talk to the guys  On the 60s  I might have it in for you  Shotgun  Oh my god  You have to have  Something like  Big Jim Norton  Or something  Big Jim Norton  Jim Norton  Jim Norton  Jim Ness Jimmy  Something like that  Is always fun  But that song  Then they did a five minute song  Where they sang  All the jingles in it  Who?  How was it?  Jam  Jam Productions  Jam Productions  You got it?  Oh yeah  Of course I got it  Wait, and you like this?  It's a five minute song  Listen to this thing 
[01:52:30]  I'd rather hear  Making Out  By Mad Magazine  Jam Productions  This isn't it  Horrible  This looks old  This is  Early 80s  No  Doesn't sound like it  Sounds like a montage  80s movie  Yeah  Like you're working out  Trying to learn something 
[01:53:00]  You see Gina opening up  Her fucking beauty shop  A tiger in Tony's house  Here we go  Listen to this  That's why we sing the jingles  And Jam is proud to say  We're the voice of these radio IDs  We're heard across the USA  W-H-Y-T-A-R-B-E-A-I-M-N

[02:09:00]  Oh my god, yes, yes, yes, yes, no, it's not working out.  Not working out.  You really gave it a good shot, though.  It was a good try, a good week and a half.  A week and a half.  We said goodbye a week and a half ago.  If you don't make it in a week and a half, how long am I supposed to do it?  Yeah, really, you can't spend your whole life trying to do that.  L.A., huh?  You got a nice place out there?  Yeah, I've had the place for a kid so we're telling you there. 
[02:09:30]  Okay, I just â€“  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got this place for a long time.  I don't know if it's just â€“  yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got to be a little crazy, man.  Yeah, they were just, the little one was just like, why are we here?  Oh, man.  Seriously, don't we have a place with my bike and a hula hoop?  Don't we have those things?  We didn't sell that place, did we?  Like, no, but don't you love New York? 
[02:10:00]  She's like, I'm swimming in a fountain.  The kids get a raw deal living in New York City, man.  No outdoor space.  No, it's pretty.  You've got to find a little space outside with other people that maybe could be your private little area for 10 minutes before some asshole homeless guy decides he has to take a shit.  I think the trade-off is they're fucking street smart and wise at like 8.  I guess.  That's true.  They're like, you know, New York City kids, they're very wise.  Yeah, when we went back out, my 11-year-old, who is not as active, who likes to go check out shows and do that kind of thing, 
[02:10:30]  and she came back to L.A. and was like, my friends here seem so simple.  Yeah, yeah.  They're so excited about trampolines.  I don't understand it.  Yeah, the cultured 11-year-old.  Yeah.  I knew it was time to do something different.  We're in Jersey, my brother's place, barely in the woods, and we're getting in the car after a little birthday party, and he hears crickets. 
[02:11:00]  And he goes, Daddy, what's that?  Oh, no.  I'm like, you know what, maybe we should do something a little fucking different.  I don't even know what it is.  Yeah, but their cousins in New Jersey are going to be covered with Lyme disease.  Exactly.  It's going to be going to IMAX and seeing all the cool 3-D stuff.  You don't need to go into the woods.  Fuck.  Oh.  Oh, what was that, Jimmy?  Tom just tore these things up, and I had to knock them on the floor.  Oh, that's not nice.  Did I mention I'm from Hollywood, Jimmy? 
[02:11:30]  Yes.  Yeah, you're dressing like Hollywood.  Well, I actually...  You're dressing nice there, Tom.  Yeah, well, I have a big audition this morning.  I can't really talk about it because it's top secret.  Wow.  It's for an HBO show called Veep with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  And as soon as I got to L.A., I'm not kidding, as soon as I got to L.A., they sent me an email about,  will you come and audition for Veep in New York?  And I said, I'm in Hollywood now.  And they said, we're not seeing people from there.  Oh, man, wow. 
[02:12:00]  And I'm like, wait, I moved here so I could be on more television and film.  Yeah.  They're like, now we're only looking at people in New York.  Wait, were you going in for the audition?  So now that I'm here, I said, can I get in?  And they said, yeah, you can.  And so after this, I will be reading two scenes for Veep.  Who are you looking to play in Veep?  Knock wood, guys.  Knock good.  Knock wood.  Knock good.  Knock good.  Knock good, guys.  Knock good.  Are you looking to play the president in Veep?  I would love to play the president, but no, I'm playing some advisor and some Chris Matthews 
[02:12:30]  type guy.  Uh-oh.  In SNBC.  Off book?  I am far from off book.  I got it last night before we did the radio show.  Jimmy was very great in the radio show last night.  And so I have not had time to even read it.  Oh, boy.  Roland is printing it out right now.  How do you deal with that?  I just read it.  I mean, go ahead.  But how do they know from just you reading it?  I know if you're good or not.  Right.  You're just reading off a paper.  They don't know.  Really, all they want to know, they could really just Skype you in. 
[02:13:00]  I should just take a picture on my iPhone and send it.  I'm like, this is what I look like this week.  And do you want the guy that looks like this or not?  Is that pretty legit?  Yeah, we've all done stuff.  You know we've all been acting.  We've done things.  This is what I look like now.  That's all they want to know.  Did he gain weight as he lost his hair?  Yeah, you have to whore your ass all the way to 38th Street just to walk in and be like,  Hey, it's me.  It's me.  How tall are you?  5'10".  Much taller than Julia Louis-Stripes.  And then you take the paper and you're like,  Ahem. 
[02:13:30]  So, I think.  Right.  Are you 5'10"?  I'm 5'10 and a half.  Damn, Tom.  That's a good height for a man.  No.  I'm just saying it is.  It's pretty good.  I always wanted to be 6'0".  I'm a fucking twerp.  Who doesn't want to be 6'0", right?  How tall are you?  6' sounds cool.  Yeah, how tall are you?  Yeah, 6'1".  6'1's a good height for a fucking man.  Yeah.  5'6 and a half, I have to say.  Oh.  That's dainty.  You have to add the half.  That's horrible.  Just bump it up to 5'7".  I've tried.  Just go 5'7".  My fucking cunty ex-girlfriend would always correct me. 
[02:14:00]  Like when she put fucking candy up on the top shelf and I found it a year and a half  after we broke up.  I remember when I was a kid, when I was short, and I heard that the Fonz was 5'7".  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I was like, oh, that's okay.  You can be...  He seems so big.  You can be cool.  Yeah, you can be cool.  As a short guy.  Yeah.  The Fonz did seem very tall.  Yeah.  It's a little attitude.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:14:30]  Remember the Fonzie doll where you press the little thing on the back and the thumbs would  go up?  Hey.  And the song was Fonzie, Fonzie, the Fonz.  Could you find that, Sam?  Find the Fonzie doll commercial.  That's hilarious.  Now I gotta say it.  There's no way there's a Fonzie doll commercial.  Yeah, there was.  He had a fucking thing in his back, dude.  It was like a little lever.  Everything's on the internet.  And you'd pull it down and his thumbs would go up.  Oh, my God.  Fonzie.  Fonzie.  The Fonz.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:15:00]  I loved the Fonz.  Did you?  I loved the Fonz.  Yes, I did.  He was the cool one.  He would have meetings in the bathroom.  Exactly.  I liked the early Fonz in the early episodes before they started filming in front of a live  audience.  It was done on film.  And he was just kind of cooler.  He was in a white jacket.  He didn't even have a leather jacket.  Yeah, he didn't even have a leather jacket.  And his advice was just kind of, hey, do what you want to do.  It was just very calm.  And then he just became a cartoon character with magical powers.  This is the motorcycle toy commercial. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, Fonzie motorcycle.  We can start here at least.  Fonzie.  Let me see it, Sam.  It's the Fonzie motorcycle, and here's Fonzie.  Each sold separately.  Ha ha ha ha!  Yeah!  Thumbs up!  And it takes off.  What?  Fairly moving.  That is the cycle not included.  He's cool.  Ha ha ha!  Yay!  Fonzie motorcycle.  That looks like the worst toy ever. 
[02:16:00]  I hate it.  It's terrible.  Oh, is that awful?  The fuck would you do with that?  He goes back and forth.  My favorite is that there's one scene where they hit the motorcycle, and the kid swings  his arms up in a circle.  Yes.  Oh, I fucking shit.  He's very thrilled.  He's probably 50 right now, and I hope he's rotting away of cancer.  Ha ha ha!  That was great.  The kid was dressed like Fonzie.  He had some jeans on and a t-shirt.  His hair slicked back a little bit.  And he put his thumbs up and went, hey!  Hey!  It's the worst Fonzie.  Thumbs up action.  Yes, the thumbs up action. 
[02:16:30]  We've had the Fonz in here, Tom Pop.  Oh, you have?  A couple times.  Television icon!  Icon.  Nicest man alive.  They really didn't even know marketing back then.  No!  Shot so bad and just...  Fonzie!  Fonzie!  It really was a horrible spot.  I've been watching a lot of old commercials.  Have you?  On the intro tubes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of funny to kind of...  You really kind of get a gauge on where you were back then.  Right.  It's a strange thing.  But you realize how badly the commercials were... 
[02:17:00]  Like now, every commercial, every second of it is assessed.  You know that they're like, all right, in this second we need to show this, that.  It just seemed like they didn't know what the...  Just rolling.  What consumers needed to see...  No editing.  ...to buy the product back then.  No editing.  We watched a dumb motorcycle go back and forth four times across the fucking...  Fonzie!  The voiceover, the music was terrible.  Like, they were just done so badly.  Just give me three kids in tight shirts.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Well, show the thumbs up action and show this motorcycle.  Like, I was psyched for the motorcycle until I saw it working.  Right.  Exactly.  And watch it take off.  It moved so slow and just started bouncing around.  It's the Fonzie Motorcycle.  I think it, dude.  Here's Fonzie.  Each sold separately.  Thumbs up action.  Thumbs up action.  Watch the kid's arms.  Watch.  And it takes off.  Whee!  It only goes three feet before it turns around.  And then it turns around.  It's so awkward. 
[02:18:00]  Fonzie.  Woo!  Fonzie.  Oh.  Fonzie.  Fonzie.  Fonzie.  It's shot like the kid's just in the lower half of the screen.  Yeah, he wasn't even centered.  The kid wasn't even in frame.  We're fucking douchebags.  I love those kids.  He'd wave his arms for Fonzie.  Yay!  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Spin him in a circle.  Would you teach him about thumbs up action?  Yeah, I would.  I'd be like, let me grab your magic lever and tug on it and your thumbs go up in the air. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, God.  Yay!  Yay!  I'm friends with Fonzie.  What was the G.I. Joe stuff like?  Because we were heavily addicted to that.  Those spots must have been really great.  Yeah, yeah.  Where did Sam go?  I don't know.  Let's find a G.I. Joe commercial.  We're doing a break on...  Yeah.  As Tom eats fruit and drinks coffee.  Oh, fuck.  Enjoy that later in the bathroom.  Exactly.  Do you feel like a cannibal when you eat that?  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  What does that mean?  Fonzie. 
[02:19:00]  That wasn't nice.  Fonzie.  Find some old G.I. Joe commercials.  Not those crappy ones that you grew up with.  Yeah.  I'm talking the full-sized G.I. Joe.  From the 70s?  From the 60s and 70s.  I was a child of the 80s, so...  Well, me too, but...  Yeah.  We're children of the 80s, Tom.  Classic G.I. Joe.  Yeah, we are.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, this one's from, like, the 80s.  I think.  70s.  And here is G.I. Joe with Kung Fu Grip. 
[02:19:30]  Kung Fu Grip.  G.I. Joe has hands that grip.  Oh.  There's two kids laying in the grass.  Yeah.  Hands that hold on with a Kung Fu Grip.  You can't do anything with this.  We don't even have a medallion.  They're just shaking hands.  Yeah, and then they tug back gently, and then one flips the other one into the grass.  It stinks.  That was awful.  That was terrible, too.  Yes.  Kung Fu Grip.  G.I. Joe with prostatitis was more exciting than Kung Fu Grip.  Oh, that's an old one, it looks like.  From the 60s. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  G.I. Joe.  Whoa.  You'll be killing the nips.  They don't even care about political correctness back then.  Yeah.  Yeah, getting those gooks.  G.I. Joe.  G.I. Joe fighting man from head to toe.  I think that was it.  All right.  It gets you into Cambodia.  G.I. Joe.  G.I. Joe.  Fighting man from head to toe.  On the land, on the sea, in the air. 
[02:20:30]  G.I. Joe attack.  Boom, boom.  G.I. Joe.  Damn, bam.  Bam, bam.  Terrific battle.  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.  Terrific equipment.  It's going to be a riddle in there.  When you get G.I. Joe and the authentic G.I. Joe equipment, you'll have...  Well, first of all, you'll be taken into counseling if you went to school with one of these.  Violence.  Box of authentic uniforms and equipment, so you can change your G.I. Joe soldier...  I remember doing that. 
[02:21:00]  ...into a camouflage marine ready for battle.  He's got a flamethrower.  A Navy frogman with complete kubus.  Blasted into the jet cave.  Yeah.  An Air Force pilot with high-altitude helmet and air vest.  High-altitude.  Get G.I. Joe.  And get G.I. Joe equipment.  It's just war.  It's all war.  Whenever you want.  Remember, only G.I. Joe is G.I. Joe.  Whoa.  Only G.I. Joe is G.I. Joe.  That's a great slogan right there.  Well, they had another one, it was J.O. Joe, and it was Rich Voss. 
[02:21:30]  That's what he is.  Going out on a limb on that one.  Wow, that was pretty good right there.  Can you imagine if a kid came in with fake knives, guns, military stuff?  They would be locked up and put on Ritalin immediately.  That's the 90s.  Screw that.  That's so stupid.  The 90s.  That's terrible stuff.  I like old stuff.  G.I. Joe.  Your father smokes.  Your mother drinks.  Find a old toy machine gun. 
[02:22:00]  60s, 70s commercial of toy machine guns.  I've read it.  Because they were great.  You could not get it.  Yeah, that top one's a good one.  You really do watch these old commercials, huh?  They're dressed like bad guys.  Yeah.  Just like gangsters.  In the 40s.  And there's a crook, like, breaking into the house.  With a gun. 
[02:22:30]  Black and white.  It's also got a fucking...  Oh, wow.  Some fun when Snubby Gun plays private eye, and you can have the same kind of...  He's dressed like I am for my audition.  Tommy Burst detective set.  The Tommy Burst has automatic...  Look at this kid.  Oh, man.  He's got a machine gun.  He's got a machine gun.  That's right.  Watch your classmates cower in fear.  Hide under the desk and run into the closet.  Three dollars.  Three dollars.  Look, he's got a little shoulder hole. 
[02:23:00]  In case it jams.  And the social studies teacher tries to save them.  Oh, my God.  Real smoke comes out.  Safe shooting shells.  Tommy Burst detective set includes wallet...  Could you imagine these things?  Oh, my God.  Seven bucks for the whole thing.  Well, it's swell.  See, Sam, that's what we used to play with.  It's swell.  Oh, my God.  And it didn't affect me adversely.  Oh, that's right.  I have 800 guns in a locked closet.  Yes, and you're dressed like G.I. Joe.  And I'm dressed like Jim. 
[02:23:30]  You are.  You're right.  I am.  Oh.  G.I. Ant.  G.I. Ant.  G.I. Ant.  Fighting man from head to douche.  Oh, find another machine gun.  Oh, my God.  What is that little...  There you go.  That one looks good.  Yeah, that one looks good, too.  Tommy gun.  It's another one.  This is amazing.  It's broken the sound barrier.  It's the Mattel Thunder Burp with the real vibra-sonic sound chamber that's loaded forever  and ever.  No batteries, no caps. 
[02:24:00]  That Thunder Burp looks like real, sounds like real.  It even vibrates like real.  It's safe to play with.  Just flip up the sight, pull back the bolt, and fire.  Oh, my God.  I love this.  I want one.  Tell Tommy Burp to your gun collection.  Oh, it's like a little...  It's fire caps with smoking bursts or single shots.  I love it.  With a little good grain feel, easy to load.  What were moms thinking when kids were running through the kitchen with this?  Yes.  Or turn the crank for smoking bursts. 
[02:24:30]  Nice.  The Tommy Burp is really for real, right down to the adjustable flip sight.  The Tommy Burp is $2.50.  $2.50?  The no cap Thunder Burp is $3.00.  $3.00.  That's right.  I could buy a hundred of them.  Fake blood for your classmates' foreheads, cheeks, and chests.  $1.72.  That's right.  Grief counselors not included.  We used to play war with all the neighborhood kids, and you'd buy those guns. 
[02:25:00]  You'd get them for Christmas and whatnot, and run around your neighborhood, fucking going  bam, bam, and hiding in the bushes, and coming out.  Like, now?  Blam, blam.  We spotted a trail with a gun in the bushes.  Send out a swat.  And the steaks are first.  We need two helicopters.  It's just my Tommy Burp.  Yeah, it's my Tommy Burp.  And the boy was killed.  It was found later.  He was holding a Tommy Burp. 
[02:25:30]  It's true.  I saw a kid at the bus stop in L.A.  I'm in my car, and he's just running back and forth.  He was probably 14.  And he looked like spazzy.  He was just running back and forth.  I'm like, what is this guy up to?  And he had a bag, like, down on the ground.  I'm like, what's in that bag?  And then he started making machine gun hands, just with his hands, and going at traffic  like this.  And I really was like, somebody's got to call someone.  All he had was hands.  Just hands!  This kid is going to kill us all.  This kid's a problem.  Not like the old days, man. 
[02:26:00]  It's your Tommy Burp.  Tommy Burp.  They were like machine guns back in the day with, like, tripod, bipods.  Now, think about that, though.  Like, think about how effective that awful, awful advertising was, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it was lame, and we were completely, like, addicted.  Sure.  And you had to have all that stuff.  Yeah.  And now with it being...  And the violence was really pretty low.  Yep.  Now with it being so sophisticated, there's got to be something to what it's going to do 
[02:26:30]  to these kids, right?  You would think...  I mean, we know what it did to that generation and stuff.  I mean, and was it...  Did it promote violence?  And gun violence and all that?  I mean, look, it has an effect.  They wouldn't spend all this money on it if it...  Right.  And it just got so sophisticated.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, now it's Call of Duty commercials.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, because they've taken pretty much all these off the market.  You don't see toy guns on TV or even in stores anymore. 
[02:27:00]  In stores.  They've distorted them to the point where now they look all goofy and they're multicolored  and things like that.  They can't look like a real gun.  Right.  So they've taken that off.  But, yeah.  When you make a real Nerfy gun, though, just to kind of blend in...  Yeah.  You're like a real gun that looks all Nerfy.  Call it Nerfy.  The cops look and then they go, ah, it's just one of those Nerfy guns.  It's just that.  It's just a guy that dresses up like a clown. 
[02:27:30]  Wailing out fucking 2,000 rounds a minute.  We've come a long way, because on Fox, there's a kid in trouble.  He's nine years old for having a hugging contest at a school.  I told him to shut up about that!  Jesus, Uncle Paul.  God damn it!  He decided to have a hugging contest, and now he's in deep trouble, and look what we  were just looking at.  Hugging contest.  Yeah, just a dumb hug.  He decided.  And we used to, like, after Christmas, you'd get your presents and stuff, and then you'd  bring some into school after Christmas vacation. 
[02:28:00]  And you'd be like, oh, look, I got this and that.  And you could walk around with toy guns in school.  It was crazy.  Is there one more gun commercial?  Because I really am enjoying those.  I wonder if you, because you had guns you could act out with that were safe, if that  kind of helps in a way.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, right?  Right?  I don't know.  Let's see what this one is.  Oh, boy.  A few weeks ago, I looked all over the house for Billy. 
[02:28:30]  Of course, I found out later that my son was in darkest Africa.  Uh-oh.  Billy was hunting elephants with his trusty Mattel toy.  That's what I called him back then.  That's the only fully automatic cap gun in the world, you know.  Real safe.  Fires one shot or in burst.  Oh, no.  He never misses that purpose.  Wow.  That thing's cool.  Where'd they just go backwards? 
[02:29:00]  And it's so simple to play with.  Is it?  The safety catch keeps it from firing while Billy winds it.  Then he closes the breach and checks his ammunition.  There's plenty of room for spare caps in the magazine.  He's off again hunting tigers in India.  But don't worry.  The burp gun's so safe, it's got the parents' seal of approval.  Only $4 wherever toys are sold.  You can tell it's Mattel.  It's swell.  It's swell.  And obviously it was okay to shoot elephants. 
[02:29:30]  Right, exactly.  We never have a commercial where a kid's shooting elephants.  Well, he's killing elephants.  It's so funny.  They had a big screen of elephants running and him shooting them.  Yes.  And look, and to go with the burp gun, try the new hook for the elephant's mouth.  To teach that elephant to behave.  One slice, you can remove the tusks and send them to China.  Yes, make trinkets from this regal animal.  Maybe a Western gun?  Well, we're getting a lot of requests.  Someone's saying you've got to look up the Entertech water machine guns. 
[02:30:00]  Carve his feet into ashtrays.  Yes.  Have a laugh at the expense of the beast you've slaughtered.  A real hunk of ivory included with each.  Yes.  Leave his rotting caucas for the buzzards while you sell his life-fucking-saving tusks for $1.80.  Don't look now.  Don't look now.  Here comes a poacher.  Shoot him in the face.  And then he's off to you killing the last 28 tigers. 
[02:30:30]  Look, it's an African man with a machine gun and no shoes.  Holy shit.  Which one is this?  It's a request.  Let's see.  Yeah, this looks new.  It's a machine gun.  I think these are the guns that they used in the movie Airheads.  Oh, in living color.  The feel.  The sound.  The real.  Entertack.  The AK Centerfire.  Automatic water weapon.  Batteries not included. 
[02:31:00]  With up to 30 feet of firing power.  That was badass.  An extra clip for reloading.  A shoulder strap for moving out.  There's also the M16 rifle.  The sidekick pistol.  The RPG rocket water.  The AK Centerfire.  The look.  The feel.  The sound.  So real.  That's pretty cool.  That's like 80s, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was 80s.  Probably the 80s.  I'm sure there were some complaints about that one.  It's starting to roll in.  Not like the old one.  The old ones were like, ah, that's not violent enough.  Yes, exactly. 
[02:31:30]  They need more elephants.  Yes.  Shooting elephants.  See if you can have him aiming that burp gun at the Negro family moving in next door.  Stop.  Oh, this is one of the Western ones.  Yeah.  Oh.  Winchester.  The rifle that won the West.  Yes.  Won the West.  Killing Indians.  Two Winchester rifles.  Both faithful replicas of the famous original.  Oh.  This is the cap firing saddle gun.  Nice lever action. 
[02:32:00]  It loads just like the real one.  Wow.  Ooh.  Even ejects the shells.  Cool.  I would so have that.  This kid's running with a little cowboy outfit on.  Yeah.  A douche.  Behind a rock shooting at the indigenous people of America.  Exactly.  Yeah.  People who are living off the land.  Winning their own business.  Exactly.  And look, some sugar that looks like anthrax to put in a blanket.  I'm really showing with the shooting app. 
[02:32:30]  We all know.  We all know.  We all know.  Someone darker than you.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  His skin has been stained by darkness.  You must kill him.  Oh, fucking A.  What the hell happened?  Don't let their quiet ways fool you.  They're not peaceful.  Yes.  Good boy, Billy.  You've shot the savage.  Anyone who lives in a triangle house deserves to be murdered. 
[02:33:00]  Click, kill them before they kill you with their peaceful ways.  Yes.  They're offering you a pipe.  You must put bullets in them.  Rape their women and name football teams after them.  And then wonder why they hate you.  Then your ancestors will lose everything in one of their casinos.  Whiskey bottle to trade sold separately.  Look, a shiny trinket to show the savage. 
[02:33:30]  Complete set, $2.75.  Right.  Very inexpensive, Becca.  Oh, God.  Is there any other ones?  It is very odd.  I do remember some of these growing up.  Like, very...  The black and white ones, like when I was like...  You remember the times they're portraying.  Uh-oh, the swivel holster.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  What? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Print it.  That's great, Matty.  That's the fastest drive I've ever seen in all my years of making weapons.  Yeah.  What?  That Mattel swivel shot trick holster can beat the fastest draw, can't it, Matty?  Let's see how you do that again.  Take your pass off, Matty.  It has a Mattel bullet-loading banner.  Whoa!  This kid's spinning a gun like a madman.  Is that a young little African-American child?  Yeah, almost.  No, he's holding the gun properly.  I can't tell...  He's not holding the side.  He's kind of a Sam.  Whoa! 
[02:34:30]  Kids, you can be fast, too, with a Mattel swivel shot.  Let's see.  Six bucks!  Six bucks!  What a rip-off.  Well, it is a leather host.  I could get two of the fucking burp guns.  Four dollars.  Whatever toys are sold.  And remember, you can tell it's Mattel, it's swell.  Ah, yes.  I thought it was going to be, you can tell it's Mattel, because Mattel.  They weren't good with their slogans.  No, no.  Because it says Mattel on the box.  You can tell it's Mattel by the M.  Not to be confused by the N, who you'll never want to bring home. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, fucking different times, man.  Crazy shit.  Every kid wanted a toy gun, though.  And, like, I don't remember much protest from the parents.  No.  No.  Like, every kid on the block had some toy guns in their house.  I do remember my mother saying, we won't have guns in the house.  Really?  Like, at a certain point.  Yeah.  And it must have been becoming a thing at that point.  You were that kid on the block? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, boy.  Could I borrow a gun so I could play army with you guys?  Baw, you mom!  Mom, man, you're a faggot!  What's this under your bed?  Yeah, having a good toy gun around the house.  But, Mom, there's an Indian family across the street!  Oh, okay.  They're not those kind of Indians.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, the whole psychological thing.  Of everything, though.  It was a different time.  I don't know.  Was it?  You won the West.  Yeah.  No discussion from who you took it from.  No, no.  How you won it.  Killing the animals.  Shooting each other.  Pure violence.  War.  Loving war.  Yeah.  I mean, not that long ago.  No.  Not at all.  And completely, everything about that would be wrong.  Everything would be processed.  It's so bad.  Yeah.  Like, looked at, not even looked at like, oh, well, we don't do that anymore.  It would be looked at like, oh, my God, are you crazy? 
[02:36:30]  Like, psychopaths are making questions.  Right.  Like, the kid, if a child wanted that, he'd need counseling.  Oh, yeah.  Like, that's the place we're at now.  Oh, God, that looks fun.  I want a toy gun, Mommy.  Ah!  I got the shrink!  What did he say?  Yeah, school counselor.  Well, he's not allowed back in school as long as he, you know, and then you've got to reprogram  the kid to not want it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just, I don't know.  It's pretty wild.  Is it better or worse? 
[02:37:00]  It's just different.  I don't know.  I mean, the violence is much worse now.  It seems to be.  That's a reaction to the violence.  Yeah, but maybe it's not.  Maybe the violence isn't worse.  Was it crazy?  It was bad back then.  Well, it's just reported more.  There was no school counselor back then, though.  I don't know.  I don't know what the answer is.  If you're a black kid, you would say, no, the violence was worse back then, I'm telling  you.  It was uniformly okay to beat my ass on the way to school.  Get the fire hose and German Shepherd kit.  Right.  $3. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  Exactly.  I think it might have been worse.  It might have been a little worse.  But we only had one news channel, so.  Yeah.  I think it's just reported more.  I think it's actually getting better.  The dog that won Watts.  Right.  Wonderful.  Break out that fire hose, Johnny.  Look, he's trying to vote.  Yes.  Don't look now.  He's hitting on your girl.  Oh, my God.  Look at the little box switch for the dog.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Watch him cower in fear. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, move his tail and see his jaws move.  That's wonderful.  Yes.  Black face for your friends, sold separately.  It's a good old day.  Yes.  That's my column.  And with that, we do have to take a break.  We have a little catching up to do.  Tom Papa, back in New York.  Are you promoting anything else, Tom?  No.  I'm heading to Cleveland.  Hilarities is my next one on the road. 
[02:38:30]  Nice.  Yep, right into the beginning of September.  So come out and see me in Cleveland.  Just go to TomPapa.com for all my dates.  He's great.  Jim's big comedy special.  We haven't mentioned it once yet today.  Oh, man.  It's coming out this Friday.  Friday on Epix.  10 o'clock.  EpixHD.com if you don't get Epix on your TV.  It's called American Degenerate.  It's an amazing special.  Thank you.  And the open is great.  Thank you.  And the open is on our Facebook page if you want to check it out before it's special this Friday.  All right?  Cool, cool.  American Degenerate.  I love that title. 
[02:39:00]  Thank you.  And also Patrice O'Neill's latest album is out there for digital downloads.  It's called Unreleased.  And then our 15th podcast is available.  Yeah.  We went with Mondo Topless this week.  Oh, wow.  Mondo Topless.  The Opie and Anthony podcast number 15.  Sweet.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius X.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:30]  Continues.  I don't know what I mean.  Tom Papa moved away a week and a half ago, and he's back in New York.  Exactly.  Tom, also known as a monumental flop in Los Angeles.  Oh, wow.  He's come crawling back with his penis between his legs.  You're missing all the action, Tom.  Outside this very building yesterday, a tourist lost a foot.  Lost a foot?  Yeah.  It's on the front page of all the newspapers, and yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Apparently.  She was minding her own business just sitting on a fucking bench eating a hot dog.  One of those shitty fucking dirty, greasy New York City dogs.  Dirty water dog?  Dirty water dog.  And what happened?  It upset me so badly.  It's all I could think of was this girl.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Well, I had another story that upset me.  That was also terrible.  Oh, Christ.  That was that Oklahoma.  It's unbelievable.  Aussie kid that was shot because three friggin' savages decided they were bored. 
[02:40:30]  They were bored.  It's infuriating.  Yeah.  They followed him in a car, and they one shot to the back of the head, I guess, right?  Oh, my God.  It's infuriating, though, is that the way the press will report it.  Exactly.  We all know, all you can say is pay attention, watch, they don't mention the racial motivation  behind it.  That's all.  Exactly.  Yeah.  They never will.  But this fucking chick was so upsetting, man.  Yeah, yeah.  This girl.  Wait, so what happened?  She's sitting there.  Right on the corner.  Right outside our building?  Yes.  A cab was having a fucking argument with one of these bicycle messenger guys.  Those guys are aggressive, too. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  The messenger guys in the bikes.  Decided he was going to pull some move on them, and jammed on the gas and cut the wheel,  and the taxi just flew over the curb.  He just fucked up.  And hit the woman on a bench.  I took a picture.  Severed her foot right off.  Just sitting there on a bench eating a hot dog?  Yeah.  The second day in New York, dude, they land at 1120 or the night before.  From England.  And they had been, like, counting down the days on Instagram until their big New York  trip.  And fucking, uh, this was her big trip.  And, like, the first big day, they were on, like, across Radio City, and she fucked. 
[02:41:30]  It's just, uh, it's so sad and miserable.  Oh, my God.  Terrible.  She's on the cover of the post.  Yeah.  Well, there's a, there's a, you never thought that when you were Instagramming.  You always gotta find the little golden.  Oh, wow, you have a picture of that?  Yeah, but there's no, by then she had been moved.  Sixth Avenue was closed by the time I left.  Jeez.  But, like, imagine your legs sitting on those little rock things outside.  Her one leg was severed below the shin, or I think the shin.  Below the shin is the foot.  I mean, I meant below the, is it below the shin?  It was severed below the sole of her foot. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Yes, that was the sidewalk.  Right into your shin.  And her neck was hanging on by skin.  I think they saved the one leg.  I think they saved the one leg.  You know, let me tell you, I've banged my shin on some things.  It hurts.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yes, the shin hurts.  A razor scooter?  Oh, yeah.  My kid's razor scooters to the shin?  Look at her.  No more pain.  No greater pain.  How terrible is that, man?  Oh, she's hot.  Ah.  Fuck.  Just coming here on a little vacation.  Dude, just looking forward to her.  And I'm sure her parents are like, be careful in New York.  You know, you're right, though.  The Bike Messenger is... 
[02:42:30]  Those guys are assholes, too.  Those guys, they just think, like, because no one else follows the dumb bike rules.  Right, right.  And they just race around and yell at everybody.  It's like, no, look, you're a bike in a crazy car culture.  Yep.  Just deal with it.  But cabbies, man, I have a disdain.  I hate cab drivers when I'm trying to drive.  Maneuver.  They're constantly in my way, fucking around, not paying attention.  Talking.  Here's the thing with the town car drivers and the cabs. 
[02:43:00]  The town car drivers, they sit there at lights and do, like, their paperwork.  Uh-huh.  And then they never see when the light turns green.  And I don't...  You know, I used to wait, you know, all right, I'll wait a little way.  And they give a dick-dick.  The second that light turns green out, and I don't care, a cab or anybody, because if  it's not a cab, it's somebody that's on their fucking phone at a light.  Yeah.  If you're the first person at the light, sorry, you can't look at the phone.  You can't do anything.  You're the guy.  You gotta pay attention to the fucking light.  Right.  It's your job.  It's your job now. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  You're gonna fuck everyone behind you.  So the second that light turns green now, bop, I'm on the horn, laying on it.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  No patience for that.  Remember when they kind of cracked down for a minute?  The taxi drivers couldn't be on the phone?  They weren't allowed to be on the phone.  What happened with that?  It's still a lock.  It did not last.  It was great, though, because you'd be in the cab, and they had some kind of electrical  hookup with the earphone, and it's running down their hair, and that, and you'd just hear 
[02:44:00]  like...  It's like, what the fuck is on the phone?  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sometimes you go, what?  What?  And they don't even say, you know, I'm on the phone.  They're just...  But, oh, that's that wacky language.  because they didn't want to get caught doing that by the cops.  He's like, oh, don't suck a cock.  Suck that cock.  Yeah, Pope Road cunt.  Stop the other cunt. 
[02:44:30]  There's more to the story from the foot thing.  Dr. Oz was out there.  Yeah.  Dr. Oz happened to be walking by, yes.  Really?  And he helped.  How'd he help?  By getting TV time?  Yeah, he actually, as she was laying there, gave her a cucumber eye lift,  which smelled her urine, determined there was too much salt in her diet,  and gave her all the rundown of how to cut down on salt.  Dr. Oz, he is a ghoul. 
[02:45:00]  His fucking cabs jump the curb all the time.  In my neighborhood alone, I know of three, at least three spots.  Yeah.  One that took out a whole fucking bank.  Jeez.  I feel bad for the cabbie, too, in this case, though.  When you read how fucking upset he was, he's like, yeah.  Well, what the fuck?  Well, you've got to think beforehand.  I know.  Before you're using your vehicle as a weapon against a bicycle.  Battering around the way.  Yeah, but you ever have a bike person cut you off?  Like, the cabbie.  The cabbie.  It's so infuriating.  Yeah, he did something that I wanted to do. 
[02:45:30]  Just not jump the curb.  Yeah.  But a bike, it's when we want to fucking crank over.  Ka-dunk.  Right, exactly.  Those arrogant guys.  Bike lane, bike lane, bike lane, ka-dunk.  Well, the one that has a whistle in their mouth, and they just,  They're chirping their way through intersections.  You just want to fucking open that door.  Bam!  They got his record in the paper, and they're calling it a shady record.  That looked real painful, Luther.  Yeah.  He was a musician.  Once he was involved in an accident with an injury in Manhattan, 
[02:46:00]  Then he was fined $50 once for improper use of a bus lane.  This is a shady record.  Fined $115 for going 65 miles an hour in a 45 mile an hour zone.  And then he was fined $50 for making an improper turn in Manhattan.  I kill you, my friend!  That's a lot of violations!  I kill you, my friend!  Yeah, yeah.  It's a lot.  Some of that was his personal vehicle, too, though.  He once went through a red light.  Uh-huh.  That's very dangerous.  Fined $125 for not activating his meter on a trip to Newark Airport. 
[02:46:30]  Really?  Do they need to put that?  What gives a fuck?  Crook.  Fined $350 for a stationary traffic violation.  And for smoking in his cab.  Oh, boy.  Those were non-violations, those last three.  One time spilled coffee on his lap.  Exactly.  Chewing gum in class, Doc.  And $100 for a taxi stand violation?  What's that?  Probably just fucking didn't move up.  He probably jumped in front of the cab to pick up.  That's not a shady record. 
[02:47:00]  That's pretty much everyone's driving record.  Yeah, that's not that bad.  If you were driving a cab every day in New York...  That's not bad.  That's not that bad.  That's an impressive record.  It is a war zone out there.  Right.  They drive, what, 18 hours a day, go home for two, and start over again?  Yeah, those guys are worth to the bone.  You ever talk to those guys?  You ever been in one when they're falling asleep?  Oh, that's great.  Literally, I've been up for four days.  I've been up and just, like, nodding off.  Jerry had a great bit about the cabs years ago when you'd get in a cab and he's like, 
[02:47:30]  you know, we wouldn't trust this guy, but it's a cab, so for some reason it's okay.  Right.  And you look out the windshield like it's not really happening, like it's a movie.  Right.  You're speeding around, dodging it out, and you're like, oh, there's a good move.  But that was a good one.  I wouldn't do that with my car.  Right.  That's the line.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do that with my car.  Oh, I thought you meant the other Jerry.  Oh, which one?  Which one?  I sometimes get into a cab and close the door on my head.  Oh, no.  Blair's cousin. 
[02:48:00]  I thought you meant the other one.  Oh, I didn't see that guy fucking that kid in the ass.  Well, it was just a little horseplay in the back of the cab.  Stop horseplay.  I was whipping his hiney with my cock and face.  Jerry Shepardini.  Jerry Shepardini.  Him, too.  Yeah.  Jerry Sandusky.  Sandusky.  So what's going to happen with those kids with that fucking Alabama thing? 
[02:48:30]  Who?  Alabama man.  Don't go to prison.  Who cares?  They'll have it easy in prison.  That's just it.  It's like, all right, there's three teens, of course.  What are we talking?  15, 16?  15, 16, and 17.  17, right?  Oklahoma?  Oklahoma.  Oklahoma.  Kids.  There's this guy that was, I guess, 22 years old.  From Australia.  From Australia.  He's here on a baseball scholarship.  So he's a productive member of society, I would gather.  He was visiting his girlfriend in that area.  Yeah, yeah.  Decided to go for a jog.  A jog.  That's all he's doing.  And then these three... 
[02:49:00]  Savages.  These fucking animals.  Just animals.  Yeah, they decided they were bored.  Nothing to do.  So they were going to kill somebody.  Jeez.  So they saw him run by the house.  They got in their car and shot him in the back as he was just running down the road.  Jogging.  Just followed him and popped him.  That's it.  No reason.  Not to harp on it, but just watch what fact they leave out.  The motivation behind it.  It'll be boredom.  Racially motivated.  It'll be boredom.  Boredom.  It was boredom.  It was a white guy.  The fucking press. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And again, if you...  I know this is so cliche at this point to say, but if you reverse the circumstances,  and it was three white guys in a car, they followed a black kid and shot him in the  back.  It'd be front page news everywhere.  Unbelievable.  For months.  Does the Daily News even cover it?  I don't even know if they cover it.  The Post has it.  I didn't see the Daily News today.  The Drudge Report is the only one that had black teens shoot white guy.  That's right.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you have to acknowledge it.  Yeah, I mean, we have all these TVs in here and not one of them...  No, no.  It's talking about that.  It's an aside story that they're talking about. 
[02:50:00]  They're talking about the murder, but they're not talking about the motivation.  They're saying it's boredom.  Right, right.  I've only seen it on CNN this morning.  No, it was on Fox News.  Did you see it?  Yeah.  I was...  I'm always kind of taking...  I think so.  They were bored.  And now...  But it also brings up the thing of...  You know, because somebody...  I get into a lot of debates there on the Twitter about these things.  Yeah.  You'd never know it.  No.  You'd never know it.  Your Twitter's such a happy place.  It is a very happy place.  Usually it really is, right?  Instagram's about cats. 
[02:50:30]  Yes, I love little kittens and racial fucking arguments.  That's where I am in life.  Yeah.  But no one wants to...  They're trying to compare the Trayvon situation with this and leaving out the part where Trayvon  was punching Zimmerman in the face.  So you can't equate the two.  It's like, oh, he was just walking down the street doing nothing and he ends up dead.  Well, that sounds familiar.  It's like, no, it doesn't. 
[02:51:00]  And even if they want to go with that, fair enough.  But look at the way...  If it's the same thing, why is the press reporting it so differently?  Differently.  Yeah, you're right.  Yes.  What I can't believe is that no one's talking about that they used a burp gun.  The burp gun was used.  Damn, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  The burp gun.  One mention in this article I'm reading.  No, no.  They will not mention the race.  But like I said, the other way around, this would be the number one story.  Right.  You'd be seeing this all the way from today till the end of whatever trial happens. 
[02:51:30]  Right.  That is absolute.  You would see that.  There would be Reverend Al.  They'd be talking about how you can't walk around as a black man.  And it's very dangerous.  Just walking down the street.  But, you know, the truth of the matter is, there's a lot more black-on-white crime than  white-on-black crime in this country.  But no one really wants to address it.  When it happens, it's kind of just brushed aside as, well, it was, you know, it's just  something that happens.  But when it's white-on-black violence, even if it's justified, it becomes this racial thing. 
[02:52:00]  It's always a racial thing.  You're not being fair.  No?  I think you address it for everybody.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think you're taking care of all of us.  Is that it?  Yes.  Yes.  We don't need to address it because you're certainly doing just that.  I do get on my high horse.  I know.  Well, you really belong on the back of it.  You're a horse's ass.  I got it, Jim. 
[02:52:30]  Let me explain this.  Just to be clear.  Just to make sure you're caught back.  Oh, that's what he meant.  I just want to say.  I love it.  But it really, like, and then you get Australia, the people in Australia, you know.  They're like, they want to try to start a boycott.  America.  They should.  They want to boycott America until some shit is done about it.  You know what?  Australia should.  They'll blame the guns.  I understand that.  That's what they've been doing.  But we'll let them do it.  But they should boycott this country until this type of shit stops. 
[02:53:00]  It's fucking disgusting.  There's such an influx of just this random violence.  Two British tourists that were shot in that black neighborhood.  It's like fucking.  And I've heard this, too.  It's like I hear the argument on Twitter, by the way, where someone will say, well, you  know what?  More white people are killed by other white people.  Sure, absolutely.  And it's like, true.  You've got to look at percentages and whatnot.  And more black people are killed by black people.  But the number is so disproportionate as it should be percentage-wise. 
[02:53:30]  And here's the scariest part that people don't realize.  And they say, oh, you're paranoid.  You have more of a chance of getting killed by another white person than you do a black  person.  Not exactly true, even though the percentages are there for white people.  The randomness of a murder.  Usually when white people kill other white people, there's a reason.  There was a wife cheating on the husband. 
[02:54:00]  There's a killing there.  There's a business deal gone awry.  There's some kind of a I-know-you crime thing going on.  It's that scary, it-can-happen-anywhere randomness of black-on-white violence that is the scariest  part.  Like, you could pretty much know if another white guy is going to kill you because something  has been building up and happening.  With black-on-white violence, it's creepy.  You just go out for a walk. 
[02:54:30]  And there you are.  Dead man.  Another fucking dead guy.  I'm watching this documentary on Mumia Abu-Jamal.  I started it last night.  And I don't know how to feel about that case yet because I think there's a lot of shady  shit that went with it.  But I'm not convinced he didn't do it either.  No, I'm not.  Hasn't he, like, never told his full side of the story?  Yeah.  Like, um, because you're not allowed to...  I mean, I think that the, uh...  I think that there's a lot of bullshit with that trial, though.  I almost think he does deserve a new trial. 
[02:55:00]  But I think he did it.  I think even with a new trial...  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  Still bad.  I think that there's some shady shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was one of those cause-to-jures for celebrities for a while.  But literally the judge, and this was overheard by the court stenographer after day one  of the trial, said something like, well, I'm going to help fry that nigger.  Oh, Jesus.  This is the judge who said this.  The Honorable Judge Kumia.  But really, like, that's...  It's kind of hard to overlook that and go, I got a fair shot.  That's a fucking...  That's really bad.  Yeah, yeah.  And for the court stenographer to be saying that, it's like, come on. 
[02:55:30]  It also, you know, there are cases...  Yeah, it's a rough one.  Obviously, there's cases of racism.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But just because there is doesn't necessarily mean he didn't do it.  Right.  You know, there's...  Right.  You know, give the guy a fair trial.  I have no problem with that.  I'm trying to find...  Like, I'm watching it because I'm trying to find why so many people are agreeing with  his innocence.  Like, they interviewed Noam Chomsky a little bit.  He's a smart guy, and there's a lot of what he says is correct, but he's just such a leftist  that I think that he's agenda-driven, too. 
[02:56:00]  I think that he'll ignore certain facts just for the greater picture.  There were people defending these three that shot this kid from Australia on Twitter.  I mean, like, there was...  Because they're also black...  No, but what was their defense?  Their defense was they didn't do it.  Oh, right.  Or, well, Trayvon got killed, so...  Or how do they know he wasn't doing something?  It's a whole big thing. 
[02:56:30]  Where...  Why would you come to these guys' defense just because you're black, or just because you're  so far left, or you want to blame guns?  That's the big thing now with this case, too, is people that want to talk about it won't  talk about the reason for the violence, the fact that young black men are committing violence  at incredible rates, they'll say, well, obviously we've got to do more about guns, so it becomes  the gun.  When a white guy, or a white Hispanic, as they made up for Zimmerman, shoots a black guy, 
[02:57:00]  it's him, and it's race...  It's a racist thing, and it's pure race.  When black guy shoots white guy, or black guy shoots another black guy, it's the gun.  It's the gun is the problem.  We've got to get rid of guns, gun violence, gun...  It's never the fact that, where is this penchant for violence in these black communities with  these young black men?  Where is it coming from?  And what could be done to quell it?  Because this...  We have to have an open conversation. 
[02:57:30]  That amounts to bullshit.  The gun laws...  Chicago, prime example.  Toughest gun laws in the fucking country.  Biggest city with gun violence in the country.  It's astounding that...  And they're not utilizing the laws that are already in place.  You get a lot of these guys that get arrested for murdering somebody with a gun.  You'll look at their rap sheet.  They will absolutely have prior gun convictions.  And all illegal.  New York, you're caught with an illegal gun.  Three years in jail. 
[02:58:00]  Three fucking years you're going to fucking prison.  So what are you saying?  They don't...  They don't fucking use the laws that are in place.  It doesn't do you any good to put more gun laws in place that will only put more of  a burden on law-abiding legal gun owners.  It's better to just enforce the gun laws that are in place, have strict, stringent sentencing  for people that do this, and don't let them out of prison or let them out on cheap bail  when they have a gun crime.  What the fuck are you doing?  Why do we see things... 
[02:58:30]  And I mean black and white.  We see things so opposite.  Yeah.  Even in this day and age, what you're saying, people defending him on Twitter, Trayvon  got killed, but I'm almost thinking that's such a quagmire of an argument, you can never  win.  And it's almost like enough black people say this, where it's like, it's not just one  crazy guy, it's the way you see things from the black point of view, and then we see things  a certain way from the white point of view, and it's fucking...  We are literally no closer to fucking see... 
[02:59:00]  We're still split down the middle of this.  There's this phoniness in this day and age, there's this phoniness of unity that just  isn't there.  We look at things very differently.  And a lot of the discussions I have on Twitter about race, I see black people looking at things  in a very society-based, oh, they came from this, they were poor, they, you know, look  at the area they lived in, this, and I sit there and go, like, no, I'm seeing it as, here's 
[02:59:30]  three individuals that are doing something horrible.  Right.  I don't care about where they came from, what they did.  It's not institutional.  Yes, there's something in your brain that determines right from wrong, regardless of what the state  determines these laws are.  It's basic human nature to feel a certain way after you do something wrong, you know it's  wrong.  And where is that?  Right.  Like, I don't care how you were brought up, and I'm not talking about the occasional psychopath 
[03:00:00]  that has no clue what the fuck right or wrong is, I'm talking generally, people, in general,  it doesn't matter that you grew up poor, or without a father, or, or, there's no rationalization  for the actual crime.  It's just, this is what you did.  You know that's wrong.  Did you watch that documentary I told you it was?  Which one?  Yes, did you.  The, uh, The Interrupters.  No, I haven't seen that one.  That was actually really good about black gang violence in Chicago, and they, they, it shows  a real, it's not a justification or excuse, but it shows these guys, and, uh, it shows 
[03:00:30]  a lot of these people that you'd see on YouTube and get angry at, like, all these flat, fat  girls, and the ones you'd look at are like, oh, fuck you.  But, but, but, but, but, you can, you really can see, like, a lot of the fucking pain these  people are having, I mean, in the documentary.  Look, I, I understand.  I just thought it was an interesting look at it, and it made, it was hard to be angry  while I was watching it.  Huh.  It was, it was a well done documentary.  I understand all that, but, but having that said with, um, with just knowing right from 
[03:01:00]  wrong.  Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, you're missing one point, and I know you'll have an answer to this.  One guy's screaming on Twitter right now, going, well, because one of the shooters was  white.  He wasn't.  I know.  The one shooter isn't white.  He's a very, uh, light-skinned, black, uh, maybe mulatto or something, but he, he was  not, you know, a lot of people were thinking that kid was white.  He, no, he's not.  Stop.  Well, there was, he's not being charged with the murder anyway. 
[03:01:30]  He was charged with, uh, driving the vehicle.  Whatever.  He was driving.  Fuck him, too.  He was driving.  Yeah, fuck him.  He should also be killed.  He, I mean, I looked at these guys, uh, Vines, uh, videos and, and their, uh, Instagram  and their, oh yeah.  The Facebook pages and stuff, and it's all this thug mentality of gang signs and guns  and, and this, just pulling cash out of your pockets and talking about killing and bitches  and hoes and nigger this and that.  Twerking?  A little twerking.  A little twerking.  A little twerking.  Okay. 
[03:02:00]  All right, then.  But, uh, that, that whole mentality, um, I think is very detrimental to the entire  black community at this point.  Oh, yeah.  I, and, and I'm not one to say what, you know, what art is as far as, you know, I'm  not going to blame rap music.  I think, like anything else, it's more a reflection than it is, uh, uh, the actual cause of anything.  Um.  But if you're celebrating that aspect of the culture.  It's got to be put in perspective.  It's got, and there is, uh, uh, an age limit to put on things. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, when you see these little kids, they're like six years old with their pants around  there and it has a little sideways hat.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  And, uh, uh, his belt fell off.  Oh, he's taking off gently.  They're taking pictures of him like it's adorable that he's looking like a little gangster.  Ugh.  Uh, and it is adorable, I gotta say.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But, uh, it's really not doing them any services.  And, and also, I get, I get a lot of people that bitch at me because I'm generalizing too 
[03:03:00]  much.  I'm, I'm condemning an entire race of people.  And I, I say, I'm never generalizing.  I understand that it's, uh, a minority of people in that community, but it's a much  higher percentage of minority than other communities have.  And you, you have to get mad at those people.  Don't get mad at me because I might give a wide berth to fucking five black guys walking  down the sidewalk. 
[03:03:30]  And because I'm profiling because of my own self-preservation instincts, uh, don't get  mad at me for doing that.  Get mad at the fact that there are people doing horrible things at a very disproportional  rate in the black community.  That's why.  Right.  So, you know, I would, I would kill for people to be just slightly afraid of me as I walk  down the street.  Oh, you are.  Wouldn't that rock?  Man.  You know how many people come up and ask for directions or ask me to take pictures with 
[03:04:00]  their cell phone?  They're only afraid.  It's funny.  They're only afraid when they walk in and they see you standing with a microphone.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Not again.  Oh, this is a different kind of robbery.  You are the perpetual mark.  Oh, I'm like a walking information booth.  People are just like coming up and help me and what's it like.  Not an ounce of fear when people walk up to you. 
[03:04:30]  No fear at all.  I would kill for people to walk on the other side of the street.  Oh, let's ask that cop for direction.  No, let's ask that guy.  I can have four pimples with me.  They'd still come up to me.  Let's ask Mr. America.  Puppies.  Excuse me, Mr. America.  We'd like to know.  Where can people find wholesome and goodness?  Oklahoma City wants in badly right now.  Jeff in Oklahoma City.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys, man.  Y'all are awesome.  Norton, Opie, Anthony.  I listen to you guys all the time. 
[03:05:00]  Thank you.  Hey, can you hear me?  Yes, sir.  How are you?  Let's go, brother.  Hey.  Anyway, I'm just going to talk to you guys about some of the local headlines.  Down here, they're saying exactly the opposite.  You know, they're trying to definitely say it's not racially motivated, and it is out  of boredom, which doesn't make any sense.  It's constantly a double standard, exactly like you guys say.  In the media, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  The cops will, by the way, the cops will arrest these.  They'll go to jail for the arrest.  In the judicial system, they're treated very harshly. 
[03:05:30]  No one is saying that they're not treated harshly or they're not punished.  Or there won't be this, and I don't consider it justice.  But, well, I hear about that on Twitter, too.  People are like, well, they arrested them, so there is justice.  It's like, no, you know what?  Justice is the kid being able to jog and go home to his girlfriend and live out the rest  of his life.  That's a just thing that should have happened.  And just because they arrest the people doesn't mean that, oh, now it's okay. 
[03:06:00]  We got the bad guys.  It's got to stop happening at this rate.  It has to be part of the conversation.  Right, yeah, yeah.  I agree with you guys.  And to me, it seems like it goes back to a product of their environment.  I mean, kids, at some point, you've got to blame the parents for not trying to raise  them better, teach them better.  But if they're poor and they come from nothing, I guess that's all they want to turn to is  a gangbanger lifestyle or trying to sit in.  I don't know.  You know what?  There are plenty of poor people in this country. 
[03:06:30]  And we need to get rid of them.  But the other thing also, again, I don't know if it's touched about it nationally, but there's  all kinds of threats going on at Duncan High School.  So they've given the parents the option to keep their kids out of school.  I guess it's supposed to be some kind of retaliation for what happened.  But, yeah, really, there's no sense in it, man.  It's terrible.  You can't jog down the road without getting shot in the back and left for dead.  What kind of threats on the high school?  They're just doing the same retaliation threats.  They've made some shooting references and things like that. 
[03:07:00]  There's extra security.  But definitely, for sure, the parents are allowed to remove their kids without any kind of repercussions.  And the other thing, you know, Duncan is a quiet-ass town.  It's not like Oklahoma City.  Some parts of it are really bad, you know, like the projects and stuff.  But here's my take on the poverty issue as far as the violence goes also.  I've been told many, many times, you know, there are a lot more poor white people in this 
[03:07:30]  country than poor black people.  Again, true.  You've got to look at the numbers.  There's a lot more white people than black people.  And there are.  There are very impoverished white people in this country.  What I don't see is this group violence mentality that goes along with the excuse that, well,  because they're poor, that's why they're acting like this.  I don't see thousands of videos of groups of white people beating the shit out of other 
[03:08:00]  people.  I just don't see it.  I mean, you do it, but they're in black and white.  Oh, is that it?  When white people do it, let's be honest, it gets done properly.  You know, you don't see many videos either of black people fucking hustling Jews into  mass graves.  I hear you.  I think I was talking more of a lower scale, like the impoverished white people.  No, no, look, I understand.  I've seen the 7-Eleven, let's go steal some Twinkie and punch the guy on the way out videos 
[03:08:30]  too.  But it's kind of hard to look past Zyklon B in the fucking showers.  All we do is go to 7-Eleven and water some beer and run the fuck out.  That's all we do.  Yeah, exactly.  I used to go on bun runs as a kid.  You'd wait until the bakery.  With that, you mean put your face in a pillow and open your asshole.  Watch what runs out of it later.  Oh, God damn. 
[03:09:00]  How the hell can I figure out where Norton's going to come play next?  Do you ever come close to Dallas, Texas?  Yeah, I don't have any dates on the books at all.  I've just been working out new material, dude.  So I'll be on the road probably again by October.  I've literally taken like two and a half months without doing road gigs, and I haven't done  that in years, just to relax and enjoy the summer and work on new jokes.  Look at you.  Nice.  What are some of your new jokes?  It's a very funny thing, right?  They talk about Paula Deen. 
[03:09:30]  I go, what the hell was she eating?  Too much butter?  That's a good one.  It's very topical.  I talk about Anthony Wiener, I'm like, don't get a text message from this guy.  He's dangerous.  Yeah.  Do you ever go up on stage just with the newspaper?  I do.  I'll walk up and I'll say something about, oh, that's a little too harsh.  You stick a newspaper up with you?  Hey, what's with this A-Rod?  Looks like he's not breaking any home run records.  This is all good stuff. 
[03:10:00]  Don't burn it here on the radio.  I'll say he's about as popular as a lead balloon.  You are well rested from the summer.  Damn.  I'm going up there like a firecracker.  Wow.  Look at this Australian chased by three animals.  The press won't report it.  Oh, that's cut now.  Ooh.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  They stole bullets.  He stole bullets from these innocent young men.  Yay!  You do anything on the Kardashians? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm saying, what's with her and Kanye?  What a weird name.  Oh, boy.  You have to have another special in no time.  I know.  They ought to go out with Jay-Z and Beyonce and have like a powerful foursome hangout or  something.  Wow.  You doing anything on the new baby over in England?  I sure am.  I'm like, I hope it doesn't look like that one retard.  I hope she cheated like the dead mother-in-law.  Oh.  Oh, that's a clever one. 
[03:11:00]  Holy shit.  They're saying that that cunt was murdered in a tunnel.  I don't know how true or false that is.  Holy shit.  Wouldn't surprise me a bit.  Those bit of fucking inbreds.  Ooh.  That's some great controversy.  Oh, William's balding.  Wow.  And Harry's got a full head of hair.  You know, she was taking cum from multiple sources.  Wow.  What happened?  I heard that big-eared incest survivor was embarrassed.  She was taking unclipped Dodie Faye's con. 
[03:11:30]  Wow.  This is craziness.  Do you do anything on Lady Gaga coming out?  Oh, boy.  What about her new song, Katy Perry, marching up the charts?  Isn't it got everything?  Pop culture, the news, hard-hitting news.  Right from the headlines.  Yeah.  Right from the headlines.  Right from the headlines.  Katy Perry and Lady Gaga's number two, and that's what they're saying about her parents' restaurant.  That it's shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is crazy.  People are saying they'd rather eat marmalade out of a cadaver cunt. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  Edgier and edgier.  Here we go.  Yeah, it started off on nice.  It started off kind of nice.  It's kind of nice.  Family friendly.  Into a false sense of security.  I was going to bring my kids to go say everything.  Well, you should.  I'll watch them.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Tom Hopper, it was a pleasure.  Good to see you, guys.  We've got a meeting waiting for us, so we've got to get the hell out of here.  Oh, no.  You're going to be in Cleveland very soon.  Yeah, I'm going to Cleveland. 
[03:12:30]  Hilarities.  I'm coming, people.  TomHopper.com.  And if you're in L.A., say hi to Tom, I guess.  Yeah, come out.  I'll be on Hollywood Boulevard.  Hollywood Boulevard.  Elmo.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Helping people with directions.  If you see a Darth Vader with what looks like two Darth Vader helmets fucking taped  together, that's probably TomHopper.  We're going to TomHopper.com for all information concerning TomHopper.  You guys wait until I get my new head shot.  Really fast.  Is there something wrong with Audible.com?  I'm getting a lot of complaints.  Oh, a lot of complaints.  I hope that the shows aren't up there.

It seems like we have just done 14, doesn't it?  It sure does.  It sure does.  No, no, no.  He's not talking about the same thing we are.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at home, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next. 
[03:14:00]  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  What's that?  Do you want, we're doing interviews for Chip at TV on the YouTubes about the UFC event.  Who did you want to see?  Who are your favorite, like, fighters and kickboxers and karate guys and judo guys and mixed martial artists and UFC guys and that, like?  I want to go see Clay Guida. 
[03:14:30]  Clay Guida.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to talk.  He's always, you're okay, right?  I'm good.  He says shit.  Should I turn my hat like that or something like that?  Like, yo, what's up?  We're here in the Expo, y'all.  Clay Guida.  Clay's a weird name.  What is he, live in the earth or something?  Who do you want to see win the big boxing fight?  The boxing fight?  The mixed martial fight.  I'm for Chael Sonnen, man.  I'm an American.  I got to go with the American.  Yeah.  My mother always said that there's too many of these goddamn uncircumcised guys coming in here, Chipper. 
[03:15:00]  They're all uncut.  I've been saying all day, silver is gold.  Silver is golden, man.  No one can beat him.  He's the best on the planet.  Yeah.  And Chael Sonnen, they're going to change him to Chael Moonen.  Chipp, Chipperson on the scene.  Chipp, Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  Attention anglers.  Still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion. 
[03:15:30]  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  Not a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fist and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger.  This collection is presented on nine full-length, high-fidelity audio cassettes.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:16:00]  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Da-da-da-da.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  What a delightful opening.  And I know you're hearing it two days in a row. 
[03:16:30]  But I wanted to do the advice show just because Sam was gone yesterday.  We didn't want to give you a replay.  And I feel that with last week we're on vacation and next week we're on vacation.  I wanted to give two advice shows.  Because why rob people of such life-saving advice?  My wife is cheating on me and I drink too much.  Jimmy, help me.  Now that was one of those things that somebody says but actually didn't mean to blurt out. 
[03:17:00]  It was just what they were thinking at the moment.  Except for the married part.  Yes.  Anthony's in the studio.  And I realize that Anthony's a little starstruck watching the beginning of this.  I actually was.  I'm looking and going like, this is Jimmy Norton's show.  That's right.  And the phone lines are about as good as normal.  Zero calls.  So either I'm a flop or you're all well.  I think it's a combination of both of those things.  I'm happy to give advice to you, Iraq, if you need some.  And I'm sure you do.  You do have some on line one.  It just hasn't shown up there but I can see it right here.  Oh, why can't I? 
[03:17:30]  What is the travel distance between your screen and mine?  How does this fucking happen?  I think your software got turned on after the call was already screened.  Oh, I see.  But if you want to talk to Josh in Wisconsin, he's trying to get over multiple addictions.  Josh in Wisconsin.  He said, well, I don't like to tease Wisconsin but say Josh in.  That's right.  Wordplay.  Hello, Josh.  Terrible joke.  I'm terrible.  Yes, it was a terrible joke.  I'm addicted to bad jokes.  We're in the same boat.  What's going on, bud?  Well, I just have some concerns.  I have an addictive personality.  I kind of pretty much everything. 
[03:18:00]  Pot, alcohol, sex.  So do I take them one at a time?  I can't.  I live in a very small town.  I'm afraid to go to a meeting for fear of, one, running into somebody I know, and, two,  not being able to do it, you know, not succeeding in it.  Sure.  Someone there knowing that I can't do it.  I don't know.  Well, let me ask you.  Let me ask you.  Now, you have these addictions.  Which one is making your life the most unmanageable? 
[03:18:30]  Is it drinking and drugs?  No, it's probably, the one that probably hurts my marriage most would be the sex, you  know?  Okay.  Well, then why don't you take...  I shouldn't say sex.  It's porn, you know?  Why don't you do this?  Why don't you figure out which of the addictions is causing you the most problems right now?  The hardest one, the one that's the most unmanageability and misery.  And focus on that one at first.  The other ones you can take care of.  You don't have to do them all in one day, but just start with one. 
[03:19:00]  That's the way it is.  Take a small step, start with one, but if sex is getting to you the most, I would suggest  that that's the one that you address, okay?  Okay.  And would you just go online and search?  Yeah, look up 12-step meetings.  There's plenty of them.  There's plenty of 12-step meetings and, you know, I think you'll be pretty easy to find.  You know, there's SLAA, there's SAA.  You can go out and just, you know, look or just go to a therapist and don't go to a 12-step  group, but do something to address it, okay? 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  And as far as, you know, I know it's supposed to be the anonymity, it's anonymous, you know?  What about running into somebody I know?  Well, I would always say this.  If you're ever in a 12-step meeting and you're worried about running into somebody you know,  who cares?  A, they're there too.  So they're in the same boat you are.  And B, there's a lot worse ways for people to find out I have an addiction, like by me  getting arrested and my name winding up in the paper.  It's funny.  Like, let's just say we're talking about alcohol.  People say, well, if I go to a 12-step group, I may run into someone I know. 
[03:20:00]  What if I see my boss?  But you've never heard a guy not drunk drive because he may drive his car into somebody he  knows.  Or, hey, my coworkers may find out that I have a drinking problem when I'm arrested  for fucking plowing into a van carrying kids.  You know what I mean?  It's selective when we worry about being recognized.  None of us think about being like, well, people will know I have a sex problem when I'm busted  with a prostitute.  We worry about it with a 12-step group.  So don't allow that sick part of your thinking to stop you from trying to get some recovery. 
[03:20:30]  All right, buddy?  Okay.  Thanks so much for your call.  I appreciate it.  Okay.  Now, Jay from Staten Island wants to give me advice on not taking Viagra or Cialis.  Hi, Jay.  Jim.  Hi, buddy.  Please, please do not take that stuff.  Why?  I didn't take it.  And I have a condition called prietism.  Look it up.  That means you get wood and it never goes down.  Yes, I've heard of it.  And I have it.  And that thing hurts like a mother. 
[03:21:00]  I had to go to the emergency room.  I had three people draining that thing, messing with it.  I still deal with it.  But because they had to put some holes in it so the blood could drain back out.  So it goes up, it goes down.  But it just, you know, you can't fuck with that shit, man.  You know, go natural, bro.  I mean, I didn't try it, but it just happened to me by chance.  Well, I've taken much less of that stuff recently.  And, you know, I don't take that much anymore. 
[03:21:30]  And I don't mind taking it occasionally.  I know it can happen.  But I've never had an issue with it at all.  I've never had that problem.  But I do know it.  I am careful with it.  I appreciate that, man.  Okay?  Thank you very much.  I had it for six hours.  And that, don't do it.  Okay.  I love you, man.  Love you.  Thank you, brother.  I appreciate it.

All right, let's go to Bo in Illinois.  Hey, Bo.  Hello?  Hi, buddy.  Jimmy.  Anthony.  I'm completely panicking.  No, no, no.  Anthony left.  Anthony is on his way home. 
[03:24:00]  It is just Jimmy and E-Rock.  No need to panic.  Oh, well, Jimmy and the slob-o!  Anyway, okay, sorry.  Okay, I have been taking Welbutrin, Lithium, Vibrid for months.  Okay, Welbutrin, what, are you depressed?  Is that what it is?  Yeah, it's supposed to help me with my depression.  I've taken them for months.  They don't help.  I smoke pot.  It helps me.  Okay.  My wife is completely, couldn't be any more anti-pot. 
[03:24:30]  And it's just, I've got, you know, kids I just got custody of that are younger.  She thinks I'm unfit as a parent because of it.  And, you know, just this huge fight last night.  And I, you know, tried to just stay away.  And I went down to sleep in the basement.  And she came down and told me she didn't feel safe because I was out of my mind.  And it was a pot.  Well, let me ask you something, bro.  Are you happier when you just smoked the pot? 
[03:25:00]  And does it help you more than the other stuff does?  Yes.  The other stuff doesn't help me at all.  Well, then, has your wife done any research on medical marijuana?  I've never taken it.  But has she done a little bit?  Maybe she needs to just be a little bit more educated about what it is that the medical  marijuana, because medical marijuana, even though I personally as an addict can't take  it, has a lot of, I've heard a lot of really positive things from a lot of people.  So maybe you could just educate her a bit more or actually have her speak to a physician. 
[03:25:30]  Right.  Well, that would be, that would be plausible because she researches the shit out of things.  But I think she's so against this that, you know, because I even tried, because I finally  came out to her.  You know, I've been doing it on the down low, but I'm not 16.  I finally told her, look, this is what's going on.  Sure.  And this helps me.  And so, and then there's this whole, oh my God, she, I mean, she wasn't going to take  it well, but she starts crying and tells me, well, now at least I'm going to  I know you love me because you've been honest with me.  What the fuck? 
[03:26:00]  You know, and now we got this shit last night.  She tells me she doesn't feel safe and I'm sleeping in the basement by myself.  And she, you know, so I told her to call the cops.  So since I stay and she doesn't call the cops, she fucking barricades me down in the  basement, Jimmy.  Jesus.  She locked me.  Well, maybe she needs to be on something.  She sounds like she might need something.  No, no shit.  Right?  Well, I think here's my, here's my suggestion from what I'm, from what I know, what you're  telling me, if pot is making you feel better and the other medicine is honestly hurting 
[03:26:30]  you, then just smoke the pot.  If it's working for you, I would still suggest going to a therapist or something else and  talking about it.  Cause there might be some, you know, smoking pot can be helpful and medication can be helpful,  but a lot of times getting out whatever's in there is helpful too.  So you don't just want to medicate, even though pot is, you know, a natural thing.  You don't just want to medicate.  So I would suggest going to a therapist and talking about your problems and seeing what  they have to say as well, and then see how the medical marijuana works for you in addition 
[03:27:00]  to that.  All right.  Right.  I can't speak on her cause I haven't talked to her, but it sounds to me like she needs  some help, but I, you know, maybe you need to reevaluate the marriage, but I can't speak  on that.  I would say for you and that particular issue, that's what I would, I would say doing the  pot's working for you.  Don't worry about her approval.  I mean, you're a fucking grownup.  Right.  Right.  It's just, well, thank you for taking my call.  And, uh, I know you're not a big pot at Jimmy.  No, but I, again, I don't, but again, I don't, I don't discount it just because I can't smoke  it.  It doesn't mean that nobody else can. 
[03:27:30]  All right, buddy.  All right.  How creepy is it that my wife just walked up to me in the driveway?  That's not creepy.  Love you, Jimmy.  Be good, buddy.  Take care.  Can I have a water from somebody, Sal or whatever?  Don in Iowa.  You're a, you know, you're a Marine sent back with post-traumatic stress disorder.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you, brother?  Hello, Don.  Thank you.  Uh, yeah, I just, uh, I got shot in Iraq, in the shoulder, and then the abdomen in Afghanistan.  Well, I shot twice.  Yeah, well, yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Uh, the two-hit rule after Vietnam is you're done.  You can either have a desk job or you can have an embassy job.  You're not going to see combat ever again.  Right.  I, uh, I opted out.  I could just, you know, fuck them, you know.  Um, so now the VA, of course, they determined all of us brothers who are coming back, but  we all have post-traumatic stress.  So, their object, the VA, I don't know how much you know about it, their object is to  just dope everybody and send them home. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  Well, I'm the bad Marine that I can't follow that rule.  I'm telling these people I want off this shit.  The agents don't fear.  Uh, you know, I, I can't live like that.  Uh, and they're fucking with me about not following medical directions.  So, I, I, I refill my prescriptions, but I'm not taking them.  And then just so you know, and everyone who, the VA who is listening, my real name is Don  and I'm not really from Iowa.  Well, let me ask you a question, um, um, mister from somewhere. 
[03:29:00]  Now, again, with medicine, there are times where I think that we as a country over-medicate,  uh, to a point of avoiding the problem just by smothering it with medicine.  And then there are times where I think medicine or pills or whatever are the proper answer  and really do help us.  Now, I don't know the difference in your case.  With PTSD, I'm not, again, qualified to speak on that.  It's a very real thing that a lot of you guys have to deal with because they fucking put  you in this awful situation. 
[03:29:30]  Is coming off your medication going to make you dangerous to yourself or other people?  Honestly.  And if you, if you think about that, honestly.  But, Jimmy, if it makes, I tried it.  I'm going to be honest.  I did try it.  I, I tried it for a month or, I actually tried it for three months.  And it made me feel like, like, in a age.  I couldn't think right.  I couldn't see, you know.  I just couldn't.  I wasn't, it wasn't me.  I wasn't, I wasn't able to click.  I wasn't able to, you know, be a productive person.  I went through the government now. 
[03:30:00]  And I just, it just, they put me in a corner.  And, and, and, and then the VA said, just keep an eye on them.  You know, I, I can't, I can't, I can't work that way.  I'm not a good father when I'm on this stuff.  I'm not a good husband.  Well, let me ask you, sir.  Let me ask you, sir.  The, the, the PTSD, have, you had symptoms and it obviously affected your life negatively.  So if you come off the medication, you still have the PTSD.  So what are you doing for that?  I, I, we have groups every month with eight of us. 
[03:30:30]  Um, I also do a one-on-one counselor.  How often do you see a one-on-one counselor?  Oh, about every 10 days, I guess.  Now is, is that, and, and I, and being honest, is that enough to combat very real PTSD symptoms?  It helps a lot.  It helps a lot.  Just to get, just to get the verbal out.  What do you think would help, what do you think would help in addition to be a more permanent solution for you? 
[03:31:00]  Or, or a more, you know what I mean?  What do you think, what else do you think might be needed to help you?  Uh, I'm not, I, I don't know.  I don't, I don't, my, my, my, my stress mostly deals about, right now, about not doing the way I should.  I want, I want to be able to function.  I don't want to be off ease.  Sure.  There are, there are, there are some, I can't remember the name of the stuff, but they took me off it. 
[03:31:30]  It, it, it helps.  It helps with that, with the nightmares.  I have, I have more nightcares than anything.  All right, a sound or a smell will set me off.  I'm not running around in the bush, you know, pretending to shoot at people.  I just, I get real itchy for five minutes and then that's it.  Well, how did you, let me ask you, how does your support group and your individual counselor feel about you not taking your medication?  Um, have you been honest with them?  Yes, yes.  Okay.  My support, my support group and, and I know three of them that are listening, who are out through the ring? 
[03:32:00]  There are three of them that are listening right now to see, to see which way we go with it.  There's three of them that support me.  The other ones are like, well, let's see what happens.  You know, maybe, maybe, maybe that master sergeant doesn't need all this guilt that they want to support.  You know, maybe, maybe talking and I do a lot of, I do a lot of boxing.  I do a lot of running, um, all that helps.  It helps a lot.  Just to get your mind cleared up without all the damn chemicals in it to get your mind cleared, to get out, get your physical activities, get your sweat. 
[03:32:30]  And, um, and it, and it helps a lot, but it doesn't, it isn't the answer.  So a little bit of medicine is good.  Right.  They want me, they want me, they want me, they want me, they want me, they want me, they have me on four pills, Jimmy.  And it's like, no, I'm not a J-Pig.  Well, I can't, they just refuse to narrow it down, they just add and add and add. 
[03:33:00]  Well, I'm not going to be, and I, we have to let you go just because I have a lot of calls, but I, I thank you for the call.  And I will say, I'm, I'm not surprised if the VA is behaving dismissively or that the medical profession is just trying to cover a problem with too much medication.  That's something that's common.  We all hear that.  So, uh, I'm, I'm happy that you seem to be, hopefully you're doing a little bit better.  I would just suggest be honest with your, uh, individual counselor and be very, very honest with the people in that group.  So if you start to slip backwards or if it starts to be like, fuck, you do need something extra, they can see the change and they know what it is. 
[03:33:30]  Okay.  Absolutely.  Thanks for talking to me, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  Be good.  And I'm glad you made it home.  Shot twice.  I mean, that's, that's a hell of a fucking story, man.  And, uh, let's talk to Rob in Atlanta just for a second, because I, I know that a lot of people have this fear.  Uh, Rob, what did you, you wanted to ask me?  Hey, Jim.  Um, I'll ask you, you know, ever since you, uh, lost all the weight and started getting in shape, uh,  if you kind of worried about that affecting the audience's ability to find you funny, just because, just in my experience, 
[03:34:00]  it kind of seems like, you know, less attractive people or more or less in shape people, you know,  generally more funny to audiences.  And since you've lost that weight, were you worried about that at all?  You know, it's funny.  And I, I took your call, uh, because I think a lot of times when we quit something or we change something,  we start to be afraid that we're not going to do as well at other things as we used to do.  Like, well, if I don't drink, I won't be fun anymore.  If I don't act out sexually, I won't be turned on by anything anymore. 
[03:34:30]  If I, if I don't keep eating like a pig and not taking care of myself, people won't think I'm funny.  I did have that fear and it was irrational.  I just don't do the same material I used to do.  And it's actually opened me up because I feel much more confident as a person.  And thank you very much, Rob, for the call.  I appreciate it, buddy.  I feel much more confident as a person because I've actually set my mind to doing something and I've done it the right way.  I did it healthy, eating better, going to the gym, you know, things of that nature.  But the fact that I've actually put my mind to something and stuck with it. 
[03:35:00]  And like, I have a therapy appointment today, like I'll be therapy, uh, gym appointment today.  And I have one Friday and I'm doing my Reddit AMA.  And I was like, they wanted me to move it because of Corey Booker is doing something.  So they're like, could you do it a little later?  I'm like, yeah, cause I can get my fucking workout in.  So I feel so much better about myself that it gives me more confidence on stage.  It's actually helped my act a lot.  And I don't have to rely on just talking about my fat tits and my stomach.  You know, it's like, we get it.  We heard that already.  So thank you for the call, buddy.  But no, it doesn't, I don't think people are judging me like that at all. 
[03:35:30]  I think if you're funny, they're going to enjoy you.  Um, you know, Seinfeld doesn't shit on himself and he does pretty well on stage.  Then again, Louie's a disaster.  So there goes that argument.  Let's talk to Joe in Chicago.  Hello, Joe.  Hey Joe, how's it going?  Good, buddy.  Thanks for the call.  Hey, so, you know, some of these callers have,  I have a pretty big problems.  Mine isn't that big, but it's something I wanted your opinion on nonetheless.  I'll give my opinion.  I've been with my girl.  What's that?  Sure.  I'll try to give you my opinion.  All right.  So I've been with my girl for about two years and I find that sometimes when I'm having sex 
[03:36:00]  with her, I fantasize that it's somebody else, like an old girlfriend, a chick at work  or whatever else.  Is that a problem?  Does that mean that the relationship is doomed?  What's your thoughts on that?  I don't think so.  No.  Are you cheating on her?  No, absolutely not.  I never would.  No, I don't think that means a relationship.  In all honesty, do you have an open sex life or are there things that you kind of want  to do or movies you want to watch together that you're afraid to tell her about?  I mean, I still look at porn on my own and stuff like that, but no, she satisfies me. 
[03:36:30]  We got everything going, but still, sometimes it's just fun to close your eyes and pretend  it's that chick at work or the chick that got away or whatever else.  You know what I mean?  Oh, of course I do.  I mean, I don't think I've ever looked at a girl.  If I looked at a girl in the eye and actually realized I was having a real experience, I  think I'd lose my heart on.  Of course I know what you mean.  I don't think that's abnormal.  I think if it's the only way you can function sexually, it's bad.  Like if the only way I can fuck, if there's ever a condition, like I can only fuck if she 
[03:37:00]  puts her feet in my face first or I can only fuck, then those things become a little  concerned because then anything sexual is contingent upon this thing happening, which makes  the other person a little bit bored or a little bit of pressure on them.  But if you can still have good sex and if you can still do it without fantasizing, I don't  think that that's crazy.  I think we all do that to a certain degree.  And don't be surprised if she's not picturing you.  You know, you're not you.  You're Warren Sapp or some other black athlete.  Nice. 
[03:37:30]  Thanks, Jim.  All right, buddy.  Keep fantasizing and enjoy.  Just don't cheat if you can help it.  All right?  Uh, let's see.  You know, because people always say like with that stuff, is it healthy or pardon me?  Is it not?  And I don't know.  I mean, like what's the best gift you can give a woman in your life?  Is it to look her in the eyes when you're having sex?  No, because she's probably trying to think of somebody else too.  You think she just wants to fuck you?  No, she doesn't.  I mean, the best gift you could probably give is to bring home three guys and say, fuck this  woman properly.  I'll be outside. 
[03:38:00]  But the second best gift, you know, for any real occasion or no occasion at all, it's  an I love you gift.  And what's an I love you gift, you say?  Well, it could be the three guy scenario or, you know, more or less, it's a gift that says  without words how much a girl truly means to you.  It shows her how much you love her and appreciate her and value her, all very important things.  It's something she can keep forever.  Now, look at her and look at every day to remind her of how much you love her because she 
[03:38:30]  wants to every day think, look, this sack of shit is closing his eyes while we fuck.  I know he's thinking of Ethel or Betsy or Gertrude or some other modern gal.  So how can she be reminded that you love her?  A beautiful piece of diamond jewelry that will last forever.  That way, while your eyes are closed and you're fantasizing about Yolanda or, uh, or, or,  or, uh, what's another black girl's name?  Eric, quick, I can't think of one. 
[03:39:00]  Taniqua or Shaniqua or perhaps Anderson Cooper.  Maybe you're thinking of him.  Maybe you're closing your eyes, thinking of that dishy newsman fucking your face, ears,  nose, mouth and asshole.  What is she going to look at?  Her beautiful piece of diamond jewelry.  That's what she'll look at that on her finger while your eyes are closed.  It shows her how special she is to you.  Steven Singer, obviously a good friend of our show.  He has the perfect.

[03:40:30]  and I am thinking of you.  So, you know, sometimes you got to buy a little goodwill with your lousiness and your relationship.  So let's see, how about, oh, Shane in Midland.  Good question.  Hi, Shane.  How are you?  Hey, Jim.  How are you?  I'm good, buddy.  Thanks for the call.  Hey, I've just been sober seven years.  Congratulations.  That's great.  Thank you.  But my question to you is, I kind of, you know, when you quit one thing, you kind of do something 
[03:41:00]  to help with it.  And mine was eating.  When I quit drinking, went to, you know, more or less a comfort food, I guess.  But now I'm really motivated health reasons to get in shape.  But I just, I can't make myself do it.  And I don't know what, how you got into that mind frame of getting exercise and getting  yourself into shape. 
[03:41:30]  What you did to get that motivation.  I mean, I work program.  I've done, you know, done everything I need to do to stay sober.  But I just seem to, you know, I can't get motivated to lose, get in shape or lose, lose the weight.  Well, we all get caught in ruts.  And I think what happened with me is I had that moment of clarity where I just got sick  of it.  I said, fuck it.  I'm just going to start going.  And the problem I have is to get motivated.  And a lot of people have this with working out is we don't see results immediately. 
[03:42:00]  We don't see like, wow, I feel better about myself.  It's, I'm still the same oatmeal lump of shit.  And you're like that for a little while.  And then you're working out.  You're not seeing quite the results you want.  And then you have that one bad eating night.  And you're like, oh, fuck it.  Fuck it.  Yeah, that's that.  That's the sabotage.  That's what happened for me was I finally just continue.  I was so sick of it.  I said, I am going to give this a real shot.  And I went constantly. 
[03:42:30]  And I said, I know it's going to be a while before I see results.  I know it's going to be a while before anybody notices I'm doing anything.  I didn't tell people I was working out.  I just fucking started doing it.  And I didn't get a trainer for a long time.  And then a couple of people noticed a few weeks into it.  Hey, you look a little better.  Your face a little thinner.  And people who hadn't seen me in a while started noticing like, wow, you look like you dropped five pounds.  And a couple of compliments began rolling in. 
[03:43:00]  And that kept me motivated.  And then it's just once I got into a routine where that became something I was seeing the results of, then the compliments started coming in.  And that is what's kept me motivated to answer your question.  Every person I've seen has noticed that I dropped a lot of weight.  And then I went and I took all my old clothes, dude, and I fucking put them in a pile and I gave 80% of them to Goodwill.  If it didn't fit, fuck it.  I mean, if you have the money to go out and get some new clothes.  Because when you start losing weight and buying clothes that fit, getting rid of other clothes feels amazing. 
[03:43:30]  And I didn't want to keep them as a safety net.  Fuck them.  They're gone.  So now I buy a size smaller and I don't want to blow up and piggy myself out of new clothes.  So that motivates me to keep going.  And then I eventually got trainers just to get properly toned and all that stuff.  But you eat better.  You fucking keep going.  And when you begin to see results, that helps re-motivate you all the time.  And then I still have the occasional shitty eating day, dude.  I still have the occasional three to four days where I don't work out and I'm like a lump of shit again. 
[03:44:00]  But then I realized, dude, you ate bad for two days.  You didn't put all your weight back on.  And I remember the initial time when I was going and I didn't have any.  I couldn't see any results.  And I'm like, that's just me irrationally feeling like that again.  There are a lot of results.  Don't give up.  Sometimes you got to talk yourself out of going back into the sickness and back into that fucking shitty way of being.  Once you start getting compliments, I'm sorry to yammer, dude.  I just wanted you to know, once you start getting compliments or people noticing, it feels so good, you get addicted to that feeling. 
[03:44:30]  And you get addicted to knowing that you look a lot better.  All right, buddy?  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, try it, man.  I'm telling you.  Give yourself that grace period of, I'm not going to see a fucking result for a while and understand it.  And you're still going to see the same cunty lump that you've been seeing every day.  Look at yourself and realize, my mindset will change and the body will change, too.  But don't panic when it doesn't happen right away. 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Let's see.  Well, we have Colin in Kansas.  You know, all right.  Colin.  Hey, man.  Hi, buddy.  Canada.  Canada, dude.  Oh, okay.  He heard Kansas.  All right.  He's got cum in his ears.  All right.  All right.  Hi, Colin.  Hi, buddy.  How you doing, man?  Good, good, good.  Yeah, no, I'm just, and I, yeah, first of all, just, no, I fucking, I listen to you guys  every day.  Thank you.  Appreciate it. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, it's like having just friends in my life, man, like you guys are.  Well, thank you, man.  Yeah, I've just, the first time in my life, I'm truly depressed.  And I've never, I haven't, I don't, I haven't felt this way.  I've just, I don't, and it's, I know that it's, you know, it's, it's real because it doesn't  go away.  It just keeps coming back.  Like, like, I'll distract myself talking to people and, and I don't want anyone, I don't 
[03:46:00]  want to burden anyone either.  I, but it, every time I'm, I wake up, it just comes back.  And I don't know, I'm just wondering if you ever dealt with that before and how you dealt  with it.  Um, well, how old a guy are you?  I'm 33.  Okay.  And did anything change in your life recently, like a breakup or a divorce or anything?  Yeah, it was sort of that kind of thing.  Well, what was it?  Uh, it's, I was, uh, I was, uh, I kind of reconnected with a girl that I fucked up with 
[03:46:30]  years ago, but I kind of never let her go.  Okay.  And, uh, I never really was able to get in a, uh, uh, relationship with anyone else because  I just compared, uh, her to, uh, everyone I met.  Um, and, uh, and when we reconnected, it was really cool.  And, uh, and I was changing for the first time that I, cause I was, I don't know, I was 
[03:47:00]  just feeling shitty for a long time.  Um, and, uh, yeah, but anyway, uh, when, uh, we reconnected, it was good and whatever,  but, uh, I'm sorry.  I can't think clearly.  Well, wait a minute.  How, now, how long ago did you reconnect?  Just a couple of weeks ago.  Okay.  And are you still reconnected?  No, we're completely, completely broken up.  What happened?  Uh, I don't, I don't know really. 
[03:47:30]  I, I don't, I kind of know how she is that we've fought before.  Um, uh, that, uh, what were you fighting about?  We weren't fighting with anything.  Okay.  I was about to come visit, I was about to come live with her.  Okay.  And, uh, and I sent her, I think two text messages and she said, you know what, you fuck off.  You're bothering me and blah, blah, blah.  And I really, I don't think that I was being needy. 
[03:48:00]  And I know that she's the kind of person who will, um, she just met somebody else is what  happened.  Yeah.  And she just wanted me out.  Okay.  Is what I think happened.  I don't know.  You might be right, but either way, dude, even if that didn't happen.  And I know it's very sad, but do you really want to be involved with a person who after  two text messages says, you're bothering me, fuck off.  Do you really aren't instead of, I know it's easier said than done, but why not look at  it in a gratitude way? 
[03:48:30]  Like, I know this hurts now, but you didn't, you were ready to move in with her after two  weeks.  She sounds cunty and you sound irrational.  That's way, you don't have to recapture this amazing thing you lost.  Maybe it wasn't the greatest thing that you thought it was.  Maybe it was just losing it that made it seem better than it was.  Well, yeah, you're, I mean, you're kind of right about that.  I was just feeling really bad for a long time.  And that when she came into my life, I was starting to feel good for the first time in 
[03:49:00]  a long time.  I was, uh, changing and yeah.  So why don't you continue changing and then start dating?  Like go to cupid.com.  We've talked about these things yesterday.  Why don't you try finding another girl again?  Don't rush it.  Just go out and do a little casual dating, a few dinners.  Um, you know, why don't you do that?  Yeah, no, I'm going to try and get it.  It's, it's not right now.  It's just, it's not about that.  It's that I can't escape from, uh, it's like reasoning about what happened and what your 
[03:49:30]  situation is, is, uh, is one thing, but, but feeling a certain way, cause I've, you know,  I had shitty breakups, you know, and you feel like shit and you get angry and you say whatever.  Um, but I don't know, man.  Like, have you ever just, it's every day it just hits you and you're just fucked up. 
[03:50:00]  Like that's, that's the question I'm asking.  I didn't really want to get into why I feel the way I do.  Well, yeah, of course I have to.  Sure.  I mean, being depressed, I, oh God, excuse me.  Um, sure, man.  I mean, that's what depression is like.  Are you talking to anybody about it?  I mean, besides me, I mean, are you going anywhere?  Um, I'm going to see someone, yeah.  Well, yeah, why don't you try that?  Because I think whatever is like, the problem is not this girl. 
[03:50:30]  She's not, she, if, if your feelings.  I know that's, I know, I, I absolutely know that.  Yeah.  But knowing it is, knowing it is a good start, but that's not going to change it.  What's going to change it is action.  And part of the action is going to the therapist and talking to somebody.  And then really, man, you got to get on with things and you got to, you know, again, go  out, maybe find somebody else, go out on a few dates, get your confidence back up or  whatever it is, it's really deep down bothering you.  You get it out.  And sometimes the therapist talking those things out really helps, but it's, it's, it's, 
[03:51:00]  it's, you can come out of this.  It's not like, oh my God, you're doomed to be like this forever.  You got back with a girl and that was a temporary distraction from the sadness you were feeling,  but dude, she would have made you miserable.  If that's the person she is, if she just discarded you like that, then she would have made you  miserable.  You, you, you, you got saved.  You took on a scale from one to 10, you're dealing with a three in pain.  She would have put you at an eight and a half or a nine if you had gone and lived with  her because she would have done it when you lived with her.  So you're better off having it happen now, uh, that you would have been having it happen 
[03:51:30]  eight months from now.  I, I, well, I mean, I don't think you're right about that, but maybe not, but I, but  I mean, um, I don't know.  And, uh, I don't know for the first, yeah, and I, I know I'll just get through and I just  want it to stop.  And, uh, it was just, it was the first time in my life I, I literally didn't want to be  alive anymore, but I know that I can't do that. 
[03:52:00]  No, of course not.  Permanent solution for a temporary problem.  It's a terrible, terrible decision.  Um, well, that's not even what I was thinking when I was, it's just that, um, even if I  was to feel this way for the rest of my life, I wouldn't want to cause anyone else to be  hurt.  Yeah.  And it's, it's, again, it's ending everything when you don't need to.  What you say, someone once told me that feelings aren't facts, like you're feeling shitty and  sometimes we feel shitty irrationally.  So like the outside world is not that bad. 
[03:52:30]  And what you have to do is just work through what's going on and there are ways to work  through it.  But ending your life is a horrible, and I know you know that, but you have to really  know it and it devastates everyone around you.  And then they're all walking around going, what did we miss?  And then after the weird fantasies about who would show up at my funeral, what would they  say about me?  Then we're like, wow, I really put this selfish burden on people.  I really, really injured other people, um, selfishly and needlessly with a problem that 
[03:53:00]  would 10 years from now, believe me, dude, you will not be grieving this situation.  Yeah.  Someone used to tell me that too.  In 10 years, will it matter?  Of course not.  Yeah.  All right.  I think you're right.  And, uh, yeah, cool.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Hang in there, buddy.  Yeah, man.  For sure.  Take care and get to a psychologist or whatever.  Just to, I suggest that a lot because again, I think it does, uh, help.  Oh, uh, Lydia in Oceanside, Dr. Lydia.  Hi, Dr. Lydia.  Hi, Jimmy. 
[03:53:30]  How are you?  I am excellent.  Thank you.  I have to let you know, I don't often get to listen to your advice show, but I've been  off the past two days and I just think you do, you're doing an amazing, amazing job.  I had to call and tell you.  Oh, okay.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  Um, the way you listen to people, the calls that you're willing to take, the variety of  issues that people are bringing to you and the caring that you're showing is, is really, 
[03:54:00]  it's really amazing.  I think you're, you're doing an amazing service, Jimmy.  Well, thank you very much.  Um, I, I, uh, appreciate that very much.  Uh, Lydia's a real doctor and, uh, psychologist and she's saying that, so it means something.  Thank you very much.  And if you ever need advice, like if say, if say your bosoms are very dry and you need  advice about how you might moisten them, I have a, a very, uh, uh, uh, saliva answer.  Does that make sense?  I don't know how to accept the compliment.  I am.  That's okay.  I do.  And I thank you so much. 
[03:54:30]  I am so happy that you appreciate my calling.  And, um, yeah, I just needed to let you know that beside being funny, it's, it's really  an amazing thing you're doing.  And most people don't want to go to a professional and you are a great, great stepping stone for  people.  And I just wanted to thank you for what you are doing for people in need.  Thank you very much, Dr. Lydia.  And, uh, it's good to hear from you.  It's my pleasure.  And thank you for remembering my big boobies.  I appreciate that too.  Actually, all I remember.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you very much, Lydia. 
[03:55:00]  That was a very nice call.  Um, Dave in Georgia, apparently his grandmother got caught shoplifting.  Hello, Dave.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, uh, my issue is, uh, I'm a traveling salesman.  I got a, I'm a single dad, got a seven-year-old daughter.  I got a live-in nanny.  Yeah, I was just kidding when I said grandmother, by the way.  I knew nanny.  Oh.  All right.  So she got caught shoplifting?  Yeah, she got caught shoplifting.  And I found out Monday night from a buddy of mine that saw her, her, uh, picture on the,  on the local, uh, police bill, whatever. 
[03:55:30]  But, uh, what do I, should I confront her about it?  Or do I just leave it alone?  Or, I mean.  Well, why wouldn't you, she's in your home.  Of course you should talk to her about it.  She's in your house with your child and your possessions, and she's been arrested for stealing.  Yeah, you should mention that.  All right.  What, what, what, what was she stealing?  Um, it was, uh, one department store, probably stealing some clothes or something.  But I have no idea what, it didn't say what she was, what, what she was caught shoplifting, 
[03:56:00]  but.  Well, you should ask her.  Yeah, you should.  Because, again, have you ever noticed anything missing in your house?  Well, not really.  I mean.  What do you mean, not really?  Well, not that I'm, you know.  Okay.  Not that I noticed, you know.  I got a pretty big house, and, you know, I just, you know.  All right, no, I haven't noticed anything missing, but, uh, she's been with me for almost  three years, so.  I would, uh, definitely talk to her about it.  You don't have to accuse her of anything, but you could have a good conversation with  her about it, okay?  I would suggest that. 
[03:56:30]  All right.  Definitely.  All right, buddy.  All right, appreciate it, man.  Take care.  All right, uh, Andrew in Youngstown, graduate.  We have to, we have to, a bit of a time crunch here, Andrew, but, uh, you graduated from  college, you had a traumatic experience, and you're trying to be a stand-up.  Yes, sir.  Jimmy, it's an honor to talk to you.  Well, thank you for the call.  So, now.  One of the reasons why I wanted to stand-up, anyway.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  What was your traumatic experience?  So, after six long years, like you said, I finally graduated from college. 
[03:57:00]  Okay.  And so, Saturday night, you know, I'm at my fraternity house, and, you know, I want to  celebrate with my brothers before I went downtown.  And, uh, you know, so I'm outside, me and my one friend are outside, we're talking, we're  having a private conversation, and, uh, these two guys right up on us, and they were wearing  masks, and we had, and I just thought, okay, whatever, typical Youngstown, weird shit happens  all the time.  And they said, get down.  Um, and me and Chelsea look at each other and go, what do you mean, get down? 
[03:57:30]  Um, then they waved the gun at us and then told us to get down again.  Um, they felt her up and asked her how much cash she had.  She goes, I have nothing.  They felt me up.  I go, there's my wallet in my right pocket.  You know, I have a little under 50 bucks.  My debit card's in there, and I gave my PIN number.  Um, we were down there probably for maybe two minutes.  Um, they asked us who's in the house, and we both said, we don't know, we had just gotten  there.  Of course we lied. 
[03:58:00]  And then, uh, they ran off and said, pleasure doing business with you.  Okay, so you didn't get hurt.  It was just scary.  Yeah.  And your question is, can you talk about it on stage?  Of course you can.  Yeah, but is it, do you think it's too soon, though?  No.  Too soon is nonsense.  I mean, uh, only if it's too soon for you.  But why would the audience care?  Like, think about it.  It's never too soon.  And you should talk about while it's fresh and alive in your mind, because a lot of times  the live emotion or the live feeling in something is what makes it funny and what crafts the 
[03:58:30]  real bit.  It's hard to go back and manufacture those moments.  No, you should talk about it as soon as you're able to, okay?  Okay.  All right, good luck, buddy, but definitely talk about it.  All right, thank you, Jerry.  All right, Andrew.  Adam, how much time do we have left?  We have about four minutes.  Oh, four minutes.  Okay, let's do another thing.  We'll do the read at the end.  We have two reads.  I have four reads this thing.  Yeah, it's the same read.  Why is it the same read twice?  I think this was supposed to start last week, but since you weren't on, they didn't know  what you were going to do yesterday, so they gave it to all of them today. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  All right, guys.  I apologize to the audience.  It's the same read twice.  It's stupid.  Not that the read is stupid.  The read is great.  I love Adam and Eve's stuff.  I mean, they want to know if you're getting enough in the bedroom.  Now, even if you think you're getting enough, Adam and Eve would bet you'd love more.  And let's be honest.  We are all a little bit fucking, you know, piggish and greedy in bed with more.  Adam and Eve is going to give you more with ten free gifts.  Now, as we discussed earlier, ten free gifts is a lot. 
[03:59:30]  Now, you get a sexy surprise for her.  The second gift is a specifically selected toy for him.  So a little something for each of you.  And the third is a little something they know that you're both going to like.  So it kind of evens David.  One for you, one for her, one for both of you.  Now, you're going to get six full-length adult movies on DVD, which is pretty phenomenal.  There's something really amazing about getting fucking porn in the mail.  It's just wonderful.  Now, I don't know if it's hardcore porn or not, but they're adult movies, so you do the math. 
[04:00:00]  This ought to keep you busy for a while.  Now, a lot of you are going, Jim, you're a hunk of shit.  That's only nine gifts.  I know what you're saying.  Jim, we can add one plus one plus one is three plus six is nine.  Number ten is the best gift of all.  It's free shipping on your entire order.  Because that's how companies fuck you.  They get you to order this stuff.  They offer you free gifts.  And then they rape you on the shipping charges.  Adam and Eve is not doing that.  To get your ten free gifts, what you've got to do is you go to adamandeve.com.  You select any one item.  You've got to buy an item.  It could be an adventurous new toy, a sexy piece of lingerie, a slippery new lube. 
[04:00:30]  You're going to need lube.  If you're going to get a toy for him, let's just say it's something that you might want to insert.  You have to have lube.  What are you going to be, white trash?  No, we don't need lube.  You can't do that.  You've got to get lube.  Or anything else your heart desires.  They have a whole lot of stuff on adamandeve.com.  Then you can enter the offer code JIM, J-I-M.  And I am who you should be thinking of at these sexual moments.  At checkout, you get all ten free gifts, including the three specifically selected items,  the six steaming hot adult movies, and free shipping on your entire order. 
[04:01:00]  Enter the offer code JIM at checkout at adamandeve.com.  That's JIM at adamandeve.com.  And go and get something sexy.  Perhaps some lingerie that she can wear, and you could put it on and act silly.  Yes, E-Rock.  Skip the last one.  We'll do another call because we're running out of time.  I'll take care of that one.  Don't worry.  E-Rock's going to take care of shit.  Uh-oh.  Let's see here.  Married, wife left, but won't sign papers at the lawyer's office.  John in Ohio.  Hi, John. 
[04:01:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing, buddy?  Good, buddy.  We only have a minute.  Thank you for your call.  What's up?  Uh, wife left May 25th.  Uh, she slammed the doors.  Took my child down to my parents.  Uh, didn't even say goodbye.  Uh, cut me off on the phone call.  Won't say I haven't spoken a word to her.  Lawyers tried to get a hold of her.  She won't sign nothing.  And it's just a, you go your way, I go my way.  So she wants a separation.  Uh, is she seeing someone else, or are you? 
[04:02:00]  No, I'm, no, I'm not, and I don't think she is.  Okay, so what do you think it is she wants?  Why doesn't she want to go through the divorce?  Do you think she's just not sure what she wants yet?  No, I, I'm not.  I think, I think she's kind of being spiteful.  But how would she, like, I don't understand why she's not just signing stuff.  If she really wants the divorce, why isn't she signing the paper?  I don't know.  There's nothing, there, she gets a, a van.  It's an old van.  She would get that, and that's it.  There's nothing else.  We were only married two years. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, that's a little bit weird.  I don't, I don't know what to say about that.  Because why, is, I now have you, is there anything that she could have found out that you're doing that's shady?  No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm completely clean and guilt-free, dude.  Oh, okay.  Um, did, was there any indicator leading up to it?  Uh.  Well, yeah, of course there was.  What was going on, but.  What was going on?  Well, uh, my past, she would never let that go.  What was your past?  Oh, just, just, just normal stuff like ex-girlfriend, just, just stuff that didn't have anything to do with us, but she wouldn't let it go. 
[04:03:00]  So, uh, she would always bring them up in, in arguments, and one, one thing led to another, and she just, she was, just made herself unhappy.  Well, she sounds like a, a bit of a spiteful, jealous drama queen.  So maybe this is just one more extension in her drama queen repertoire.  Because if she wanted to go through with it, the fact that she's not signing anything in the lawyer's office tells me she likes the performance of this, and she likes the drama. 
[04:03:30]  Uh, just like she probably liked to bring up those shitty emotions by bringing up ex-girlfriends in arguments for no reasons.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I don't, I don't disagree, but it's like, I called the lawyer yesterday, and I'm, I, I thought we were, I thought I was waiting on a court date.  And he goes, uh, no, she hasn't even come in to sign the papers.  When's the last time you saw your kid?  Oh, my kid?  Yeah. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, I, I see my kid every week, but, but I had, but my, uh, my ex-wife, she, she had to go back and live with my ex-wife, because I'm on the road.  Your kid did.  Well, I, yeah, yeah, so I can't, yeah, so I lost that privilege in my life.  Wait, do you have a kid with your current wife?  No.  Oh, I'm sorry, okay, you, I thought you guys had a kid, so she just up and left for no reason.  Maybe she's jealous that you're connected to your old life and your ex-wife for some reason.  Well, that, that, dude, that was just, that was just a, that was just one of the things that, that pissed her off, and she would bring it up regularly, but there was no, there was, hell, she could look at my text any time, there was no real contact of anything. 
[04:04:30]  I mean, you know, it was, any time I made, uh, contact with the ex-wife, it was really brief and short.  There was nothing said.  All right, we got to run, buddy, because a great Ron and Fez are coming up, but I will just say this.  She sounds like a drama queen, and, um, you know, from what you're telling me, it doesn't sound like you did anything to deserve this, so, uh, hopefully she'll come back. 
[04:05:00]  Otherwise, just start fucking somebody ten years younger, all right?  Yeah, I'll call you, I'll call you later.  Be good, buddy.  Take care.  What do I do in terms of diet?  Grilled chicken is what I eat when I'm on the road, someone asked.  Is it okay to give up a good job opportunity for a girl?  Um, I don't know, I wouldn't, unless you know she's gonna let you fuck around the ass, then that might be a motivator.  22 years old, could sleep with a 30-year-old woman with kids, should I do it?  Absolutely yes!  39 years old, 25-year-old girlfriend has been married to his wife for 17 years. 
[04:05:30]  She's burning the candle at both ends.  Be very careful, do not cum in the young girlfriend, shoot it in her hair.  Biff, I called in yesterday, my pregnant wife wouldn't talk to me.  She called me late last night, wanted to update Jimmy.  Try calling next week, Biff, I apologize, we are absolutely out of time.  We have two minutes?  No, you're next to call back in two weeks.  Oh, two weeks, okay.  Uh, yeah, we're off next week.  But, uh, thank you guys for your calls, I apologize for rushing at the end.  Thank you.  Lydia?  Jim Norton is now done dealing with your bullshit.
