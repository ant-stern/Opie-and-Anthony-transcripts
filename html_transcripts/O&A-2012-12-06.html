<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about one host's tucked-in shirt and a microphone smelling strongly of bad breath, leading to speculation about the culprit's identity within the staff.  This transitioned into a segment featuring a listener-submitted gift for Jimmy: a collection of crudely-drawn Christmas cards from "Nancy," featuring obscene imagery, poor spelling, and numerous penises, vaginas, farts, and Mr. Hankey.  The gift also included a t-shirt with an offensive message.

The conversation then shifted to the upcoming visit of One Direction, focusing on their management's strict rules and the security surrounding their appearance.  The hosts speculated about the security measures and the potential consequences of violating the rules.  They also discussed a strange John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John music video and debated the authenticity of Taylor Swift's publicized relationships, suggesting they were largely for publicity.  Joe Piscopo was mentioned as a scheduled guest.

A sexually explicit skit mimicking a woman describing a sexual encounter, performed by Taylor Scherge, opened the next segment.  The hosts then contrasted the potential consequences faced by an Australian radio show for a prank call with what would happen in America. A humorous "Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get" segment featured a fictional interview with Taylor Swift.  Joe Piscopo's recent tweet about getting a Christmas tree in warm weather was discussed, followed by one host's purchase of an expensive automated snow-producing Christmas tree, which was met with much ribbing.  A phone call with a supposed snow tree salesman ensued.

An advertisement for a laser comb was mocked initially, before the hosts acknowledged its possible effectiveness.  One host discussed his hair transplant experience. The Australian radio show's prank call targeting Kate Middleton's hospital room was played, involving impersonations of the Queen and Prince Charles.  The hosts discussed the prank's success, potential consequences, and compared their studio's inadequate size and equipment to the Australian show's superior facilities.  They voiced frustration with their management's lack of resources and criticized the "fiscal cliff" and political gridlock in Washington, criticizing government spending.

The show continued with a discussion about politicians "bringing home the bacon," shifting to a broader critique of the American political system, partisan gridlock, and the lack of domestic manufacturing.  A humorous interlude featured a fictional invention, "hat television."  The hosts criticized the perceived ineffectiveness and wastefulness of politicians, using vulgar language.  They contrasted California's high taxes with Tennessee's (a caller, Chuck, corrected their assumption about Tennessee's lack of sales tax, pointing out the high sales tax instead). The conversation then moved to a lengthy, vulgar critique of the New York Jets' quarterback situation and Rex Ryan's coaching decisions.

An Anthony audition anecdote led to a discussion of Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory show, featuring clips with slowed-down videos purportedly showing reptilian features on former presidents' faces.  The hosts offered sarcastic commentary.  A video seemingly showing a cell phone in a Charlie Chaplin silent film sparked a debate about time travel.  Joe Piscopo joined the show in studio, recounting a Christmas tree experience and discussing his difficult and expensive divorce, complaining about his ex-wife's lawyer and the legal system.

Joe Piscopo's detailed account of his contentious divorce dominated a significant portion of the show.  He described high child support payments despite having significant custody, the interference of the New Jersey state system with an out-of-court settlement, his ex-wife's arrest for endangering their children, and the emotional toll of having his children briefly in foster care.  He detailed his ex-wife's erratic behavior and substance abuse, the financial strain of court-mandated payments irrespective of his income, and his living situation (briefly a hotel, then a court-mandated house purchase). He discussed his current girlfriend, the surprise pregnancy, and the birth of his new daughter.  He also alluded to other women and their legal battles, suggesting a pattern of women pursuing financial gain through the courts, mentioned accusations against him, and the media's sensationalizing of the case. He expressed exhaustion but found catharsis in sharing his story, plugging his upcoming performances.

In a later segment, Joe Piscopo reminisced about his time on Saturday Night Live, discussing his relationships with fellow cast members like Eddie Murphy and Dick Ebersole (mentioning near-physical altercations),  naming other cast members (Tim Kazerinsky, Mary Gross, Robin Duke, and Julie Louis-Dreyfuss), and detailing his difficult divorce proceedings, financial arrangements post-divorce, humorous anecdotes about his ex-wife's post-divorce behavior, current romantic life, future plans, and jokes about his age and multiple children.  He promoted his upcoming shows, and the show ended with a commercial for Hinder's new album.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Woo! Woo! Woo!  Alright. Jimmy's opening up a gift.  Show is on the road.  He's opening up a gift.  It's funny how around your friends, I came in, and I never tucked my shirt in, I just don't.  I took a piss before I left and just tucked it in, and  the first thing they do is start laughing at my tucked-in shirt. 
[00:00:30]  Oh. And they're right.  Why would you tuck your shirt in?  You are very slender these days, though.  That's not that, I just literally...  You're a slight man now.  Yeah.  You're a slight man.  You're slightly a man.  I gotta stop the festivities for a second.  Oh, shit.  This fucking mic smells like bad breath.  Yeah?  How do we handle this?  Spray it with something?  Oh, my God.  And I know it's not mine.  I know mine.  Because I'll smell a fucking coffee lid every once in a while, so I know my smell.  You got some spray?  Fuck!  Let's soak it...  Whoa. 
[00:01:00]  Let's soak it in hot water.  Seriously, man.  Do we have...  What do we even do?  It's disgusting.  Where's the shit down there?  I don't know.  I got...  What do you got?  I got gas duster if I want to huff.  No.  Lysol.  Lysol.  That shit works.  It's disinfectant spray.  More duster.  Who the fuck is huffing around here?  Come on.  Baby powder spray.  You're walking on sunshine.  Without the ding.  Yeah.  So you can't even use the...  Whoa.  Hit myself in the eye. 
[00:01:30]  It's gonna go off.  What do you do?  Spray with the Lysol?  Yeah.  Give it a little fucking Lysol.  We've got the bad breath around here.  There you go.  Who else uses that mic?  Fuck.  Who is it, really?  Well, I use it from 10 to 11.  Oh, boy.  I'm accepted.  Well, that's not...  It wouldn't be that for 24 hours.  It's not literal stink that comes out of your mouth during that show.  I don't think it would stink up the actual microphone.  Thank goodness it's just metaphorical.  And then Fez sits there throughout the afternoon.  Oh.  Yeah, but he doesn't talk, so it must be Pepper Hicks or something. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, shit.  Get the word, Arani.  Oh, boy.  That someone on his staff has horrendous bad breath.  It had to be someone that was using this mic that was new.  Oz.  What's up?  Mars, do you spray this shit every day?  You forget to spray it today?  I normally do, but that's a week-old sock, windscreen.  That's a week-old, man.  Holy fuck.  So I haven't been spraying it because it's a week-old.  I don't remember the last time I complained about bad breath on the fucking microphone.  How old is mine?  A week.  Everybody's in here. 
[00:02:30]  It's a week-old.  Dude, this was brutal.  I mean, the Lysol seems to be doing the job.  Okay.  If you want me to change it, we can do that.  No, I'm fine now.  Lysol disinfectant.  Works great.  All right.  Back to Jimmy, who got a gift.  You didn't like my tucked-in shirt, Sam?  No.  You look like a retard.  Oh, Jesus.  The wrapping paper on this is porno.  It's like a bunch of porno wrapping paper.  Come on, Edgar.  And, oh, Edgar.  Jesus Christ.  The box says bang on on it.  I don't know what, um... 
[00:03:00]  It's like a small pizza box-looking thing, like a one-serving, single-serving pizza.  At least that's what it was.  I'm hungry.  Wouldn't that be great?  I would go for a little slice, too.  All hot and ready to eat.  So there's a card and yet another wrapped thing inside the box that was wrapped inside a FedEx-type box.  Of course you've got to read the card first there, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  The card, it's a circle with a tongue coming out of it.  It looks like a mouth on the other side.  And it says, glory, glory, hallelujah. 
[00:03:30]  Funny.  And then you open it.  It's from the chipper collection of Hallmark.  And it's a penis.  Oh.  Over a gross mouth.  This is every bad cliche gift that a listener thinks Jimmy wants to get.  Because it's fucking porno and then wrapping paper's nude, ladies.  And I got a card with a chick and a glory hole.  Well, it says, happy 2013, cuntbags.  XO, love Nancy.  P.S., suck a dick.  Nancy.  And then it says, semen's greetings.  Semen's greetings.  It's supposed to be seasons, Nancy. 
[00:04:00]  That's fucking funny, man.  All right.  Let's open the gift.  Now here's this little red tissue-y paper kind of stuff.  This is not a card.  This is just another one.  Oh.  It's really positive.  It's a second card.  Hopefully that's the one with the anthrax in it.  Oh, we get the penis card.  Oh, mine's different.  Glory, glory, hallelujah.  Wait, it's the same card.  To the sweetness, the sweetest, tranny-loving little buttercup, I fucking love you, Nancy. 
[00:04:30]  Nancy.  And it says, semen's greetings.  But it's supposed to say, season's greetings.  I don't think she misspelled it.  Jesus.  That's so funny.  It's been a printing error.  So she could have put all her names on one card.  Yeah.  But here's the little other thing.  It's the sticker that's holding the wrapping paper on it.  It's a little doody.  It's a doody.  It's Mr. Hankey.  It's Mr. Hankey.  Oh, I mean.  There's a little...  It's a suck-it on it.  Yeah, you open it up.  Tissue-y paper.  Oh, my God.  And there's more words.  Oh, my God.  There's, like, letters.  There's something else wrapped up. 
[00:05:00]  Wrapped in a single red ribbon tied in a bow, keeping everything together.  There's a lot of literature here.  Oh, my God.  More cards.  A note.  Oh, wait.  I think I'm starting to get what this is.  And it says, uh, hi, sexy pants.  For the past 20 years, I've been making Christmas cards for my stupid friends.  Ah.  Here are eight of my favorites.  Fuck.  Here are eight of my favorites.  You didn't?  No.  I hope they make you laugh.  That looks like the letter that fucking Marty left for Doc Brown.  Oh, she makes these.  Yes. 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  She's looking for the big plug all up today.  Yeah, she got a big commercial just now.  I didn't say she was up.  And we didn't see this one coming.  We're usually pretty good at this shit.  This one's a vagina.  It opens it up and it says, Merry Cuntmas.  Merry Cuntmas.  It doesn't...  It's not even clever.  I'm sorry.  Let's put the cunt back in Christmas.  Yeah, yeah.  What does that mean?  It's true.  It's a vagina.  Did we ever have the...  Did we ever have the cunt in Christmas?  Christmas?  Well.  Have you ever been to my house?  I did for nine years.  Two weeks.  Nine times. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, Edgar's trying to rip it, but he's not.  Edgar, you're weak.  You can't do it.  What's the next card?  Let's see the next one.  That's a...  It's a little lady on the front of a card and she's standing in front of a fireplace and  there's a little poof, a little gas coming out.  She's broken wind.  Oh, she's farted.  She's holding a stocking.  Yeah.  And it says, the stockings were hung by the chimney with...  Cock.  Bunch of dots.  We have to guess the word?  With what?  Pubic hair.  With what?  Wait, with... 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's a...  That's actually funny.  That's funny.  Is it?  Carradine.  That's David Carradine hanging by the neck.  And there's a drip of tinkle on the floor and there's a rat licking it.  And of course, he's wearing a broad panties.  Oh, that's very topical.  That's good.  What the fuck?  What if it was three years ago?  You need a fucking guitar.  Except if you're playing a dick and balls.  There's a cock and balls.  The card is shaped like a dick and balls.  That's an arm and a bicep. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, right.  Oh, jeez.  Shoving it up your ass.  All right.  Now, what does that one say?  Christmas can suck it.  Happy cock.  Honey cock.  Christmas can suck it.  Christmas can suck it.  And then it says, don't forget to shove this card up your fucking ass.  And the lady, there's a bunch of sperm behind her.  It's not really capturing the essence of Christmas.  I got to tell you, I got a really big family.  I don't know why we send these to.  Yeah, who would you give these to?  Maybe one of my uncles.  Oh, I noticed every card the girl on it is farting. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's her thing.  This is like a Klansman.  Gimmick.  This is a Klansman.  There's like a little poof.  Oh, Klansman.  Cool.  Which means a fart's coming out.  Yeah.  And you open it up and there's a burning cross.  Uh-huh.  And there's some little snowman.  And once again, she's poofing.  Yeah.  Right.  And she says, I'm dreaming of a really white Christmas.  Ah-ha.  Because she's dressed like a Klansperson.  And on the back, who is that?  On the back, it says douchebag approved.  And it's Mel Gibson.  Wow.  I'm sure Mel Gibson really loves that his picture's on there. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, I doubt it.  And the card is shaped like a Klan hat there.  Yeah.  A little Klansman.  Yeah.  This one is shaped like a square.  And it says, there's a man, a little elf boy in a green hat.  And he's reading something.  And there's not a good Christmas tree.  And Santa Claus is lying face down on the floor.  Uh-huh.  And the lady's standing pointing in the direction of Santa Claus. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-huh.  And there's a little poof coming out of her.  Oh, there's a poof coming out of her hiney?  She's breaking Christmas wind.  That's crazy.  And she writes, why is Santa dead?  And why is his asshole filled with semen?  And then you open the Christmas card.  And there's a penis.  Uh-huh.  With things shooting out.  And it says, Merry Jismas.  Merry Jismas?  This is...  This is... 
[00:09:00]  There's no creativity behind this.  I wonder if she had her meeting with Hallmark yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll go over great.  Right.  Three more.  And this one's also shaped like a square.  It's a rectangle, really.  Yeah.  It's got...  It's split in half almost.  There's Santa on one side.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  Drinking something.  Yeah.  Reddish.  So many details.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  And there's...  On the other half of the card, there's half a tree.  Uh-huh.  And there's that same lady who's probably Nancy.  Is she poofing out her ass?  She's breaking Christmas wind.  Oh, look.  And the sign says, hmm, let's see.  AIDS blood.  AIDS blood.  Where could I have put that jar of AIDS blood?  I'm guessing that's what Santa's drinking instead of cookies.  She gave Santa AIDS with...  Why don't you have a glass of AIDS blood? 
[00:10:00]  And why would Santa drink it?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he say, where's the milk?  Doesn't like anything like milk.  And if she's in the other room poofing, why is Santa in her house?  She's awake.  But then it says...  She's naughty.  Happy holidays.  And it has Christ with the lifesaver over him.  Thumbs up.  Is he poofing?  That's a halo.  No, the Lord doesn't do that.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How many more are these?  Oh.  Two.  This one is just her...  There's a photo of a girl leaned over in a Christmas hat. 
[00:10:30]  And then you can see Santa feet behind her.  And there's like white snow on her.  It says Santa Gives.  Oh.  And then, oh, come on thee faithful.  Come on thee faithful.  Ew.  Which writes...  Oh.  You know, there's another card inside.  It's a heart.  This is a parody of a Milk Gives ad that ran in Canada for years.  It just looked like everyone was getting jizzed on.  Ah.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Oof. 
[00:11:00]  Thank God.  Oh, great Karnak, I give you the last card.  What is awful?  No, no.  This one has a lady with angel wings.  And she's holding a dildo.  And she's pretty.  And she's poofing.  Of course.  Breaking Christmas wind.  It's always funny.  And there's a sign.  The words say, how to make your Christmas tree angel.  Cut around dated line. 
[00:11:30]  Or dotted line.  Well, she spelled dotted wrong.  On a card.  She spelled doted.  It should be.  She put D-O-T-E-D.  Is that wrong?  No.  That's incorrect.  Yeah.  So cut around doted line.  It's on her actual card.  Yeah, she spelled doted.  You know, the line that you dote on.  Yes.  Get ladder.  Which I'm glad she put two D's in.  Climb on top of ladder.  And then number four is shove up ass.  Oh.  Cool.  She's probably sold a lot of these cards.  Yeah, I'm sure she has. 
[00:12:00]  But then it opened it up.  And it has the back end of a hyunine and a vagina farting.  Of course.  Oh, it's passing.  Merry Christmas, you stupid cunt.  That's a good one.  Maybe this plug hole thing's not a good idea.  You asked for it.  Fuck.  And there's a shirt.  That's a very high quality t-shirt.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  There's more shit in there.  More gifts for me.  Yay.  What's the shirt say?  It's really well made.  It looks like those iron-on letters. 
[00:12:30]  It's one of those t-shirts that make you itchy immediately.  Yeah.  And just feels tight on you.  Chip is laughing.  I haven't seen it yet.  He's not turning it toward me.  Is it funny, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  Let me read the shirt.  You're just going to stop the show.  All right.  No, I can't see it.  You're holding it.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Let me see.  Oh, jeez.  It's iron.  Literally, it's iron-on letters. 
[00:13:00]  It looks like my face is leaving at nine.  Be on it.  You like that?  What?  It's like he wants a pussy on his nose or something.  Is that a 69 joke?  I don't know.  This is not a new idea, by the way.  Not a new idea, because I remember as a child going into my parents' room and going into  one of the night table drawers.  Your parents' night tables, right?  On the side of the bed. 
[00:13:30]  I think it was my dad's side of the bed.  And I opened it up.  And in there was a card that it said, happy birthday.  And you opened it up.  And it was a pop-out card.  And a giant penis popped out.  It said, you big prick.  It was a happy birthday, you big prick.  And we used to laugh our ass off.  We'd sneak in just to look at that card and laugh.  A dirty card?  Because it was the funniest fucking thing.  When you were 17.  Yes.  I'd shove it in my asshole. 
[00:14:00]  What's this lady's name, man?  Nancy.  She put a lot of effort into it.  And this is Heavy Metal Fun Times Activity Book.  Oh, great.  Where there's like, it's got a lot of heavy metal.  The Forwards by Andrew W.K.  Is it a coloring book?  Which one?  Um, and it's a bunch of, uh, I guess heavy metal mazes and puzzles.  What a load of shit thing, uh, this woman gave you.  He writes, for all you familiar with me, hello. 
[00:14:30]  And it's just a bunch of, uh, a bunch of heavy metal puzzles.  Man, it's awful.  Well, today's gift is, you know, lackluster.  Not really a good gift.  Today's gift is lackluster.  Oh, this is cool.  Draw yourself as Gene Simmons from Kiss.  I like this.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, boy.  Is that Gene Simmons, though?  That's his eyes, yeah.  That's just the eyes part.  I'd be in such a bad mood if somebody gave me one of these cards for Christmas. 
[00:15:00]  This is a fun, fun book.  It's not fun.  Activities.  Activities.  It's like real activities.  Color Black Sabbath.  Yay!  Are you gonna do that one?  Where's my crayons?  They didn't give you crayons shaped like penises and clitorises and nipples?  I'm a very good colorer.  Are ya?  Yeah.  We can get some, uh, crayons for you.  I'd love to color my Black Sabbath.  Who are those people in Pantera?  I don't know.  I don't know who the Sabbath is.  This should be called Four Quilt Men. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, they don't look really bad.  I think that's Metalocalypse.  No, I don't know who these people are.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  This is a horrid, horrid gift.  You don't think this is a good gift?  No, all of it was terrible.  Well, people can try again.  They can send their gifts to Opie and Anthony, Care of Sirius XM, 1221.  Oh, yeah.  People were asking for the address.  1221 6th Avenue.  This is a very Plagola Christmas.  New York, New York, 10020.  A very Plagola Christmas. 
[00:16:00]  A very Plagola Christmas.  Yesterday was that guy's cupcakes who then tweets me and says, oh, I forgot to give the  phone number out.  Relax.  You got your plug out.  Look, you get to connect the holes.  Holy fuck, you got a free plug yesterday.  With his terrible pants.  He's like, could you please give the phone number?  No.  Did you see how he was wearing his headphones at one point?  Like, you know how Voss wears his headphones like almost sideways?  Yeah.  He had, because you know, there's like an access point where it swivels up.  So he was wearing one earphone completely up in the headphone.  Why can't people just look at their fucking headphones and realize like, it's not that hard 
[00:16:30]  to put on.  But I will say, how was that pie?  It was amazing.  You had some?  Yeah, his shit was great.  Did you have any cupcakes?  No.  Who ate cupcakes?  I had some of the frosting off of one.  I wanted to.  Was it good?  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah.  Nice.  I feel like Jim lives through us eating dessert.  Vicariously.  When he can't do it himself.  Can't.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Today's gift was a bust. 
[00:17:00]  It's terrible.  Do better tomorrow, please.  Are we all going to fight over the cards?  Who gets to keep a few to send out to our friends and family?  I'll send them.  This holiday season.  You will?  Chipper.  Which one?  The cunt one?  Merry cunt.  What a peck up.  What a peck up.  Somebody paid shipping from Canada.  Oh, boy.  That extra.  Thank you, Nancy.  An easier gift, though, would just be like a photo of your own vagina. 
[00:17:30]  So much simpler.  Just send that.  Maybe put a bowl around it, right?  Jesus.  All right.  Good stuff.  So the front page of the post today has got the face of a killer.  Ah, the subway push guy.  Off the rails.  High into the train.  Read how they describe the guy.  A chilling.  If looks could kill.  Accused killer named Davis with a chilling, dead-eyed stare yesterday. 
[00:18:00]  That's not a chilling, dead-eyed stare, is it?  I don't find that look.  I find that look to be not scary at all, actually.  Of course.  That looks that kill.  Of course.  But they have to pump it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks kind of like 50 Cent a little bit.  Right?  A little bit in that picture.  Than everybody.  What do you mean?  They all look alike, I guess.  No, I'm just saying he kind of looks like Fiddy.  Oh.  You said everybody, didn't you?  Well, anybody with a, you know, shaped head like that.  Oh, oh, oh.  That look. 
[00:18:30]  I was enjoying some music yesterday.  Really?  Thanks to Travis.  Pearl Jam?  No.  No?  He sent me a link to a video.  From the Mod Squad?  No, no, Danny.  I'm sorry.  Danny sent me the link in the story.  One of the guys.  It's the new Olivia Newton-John.  John Travers.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I did screen that myself.  Wow.  Fucking good, right?  What's that? 
[00:19:00]  What is it?  An anniversary for the movie?  Yeah.  I'm guessing.  I'm seeing it.  They're doing a charity Christmas album.  Right.  Which is nice.  And they did a video for it.  It's fun.  No, they're delusional.  Oh, it's fun, all right.  Are they coming around here to promote it?  Yeah.  They're here next week.  Next week.  We're not going to meet him, though, right?  No.  He's got his wig.  I want to meet him.  Is he one of those guys we're not allowed to look at him when he's here?  Why can't we meet him?  Every once in a while, there's celebrities that come through who are not allowed to look  at him.  Yeah, I don't know.  I heard you weren't going to get to.  I don't make those calls. 
[00:19:30]  Who said you wasn't?  Roland said he's going to be very closed off.  I'll tell you one thing.  That Travolta can fly some fucking planes.  He sure can.  He's a rich motherfucker.  He's got that airport right at his house.  It's crazy.  Hello, handsome.  What?  Oh, hi.  Hello.  Oh.  Let's go back to my place.  We don't have to leave the audio on.  The phone that translates for you.  Good boy.  Well.  It's almost over.  It's worse than Android Jelly Bean.  No, it's not.  It makes us look like we have real fucking advertisers.  Yeah, it's true. 
[00:20:00]  We look like stars right there.  Got a droid commercial on the O.P. and Anthony show.  I think you might like it.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Back together again.  Look, it almost looks like Grease Lightning.  Oh, boy.  The car is driving really slow in the video.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  The country dance.  He's smiling and laughing.  Well, he's in an airplane.  Here comes my hometown.  So good to get my wheels down. 
[00:20:30]  I'm coming home tonight.  Tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Look how slow she's going.  This drove me nuts.  She is driving so slow.  Why are they doing that?  Because she's 80 years old.  Oh, God.  Someone was scared to use their car.  She's got a big car full of gifts. 
[00:21:00]  But she perhaps received some custom-made brassieres.  I'm coming home.  I got a little dance for you.  I think you might like it.  Let's do the dance for you.  I think you might like it.  This is great.  Oh, look.  They're having a big reunion.  They're hugging and dancing on the Travolta's runway. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, they're back in grease lighting, it looks like.  Right?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Is that Travolta's water?  Is it?  The chubby one?  They make chubby kids, huh?  Really?  Is it?  It looked like it.  It was that one.  These old bats. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, Travolta.  See his wig fly off.  That'd be great.  A couple of soldiers coming into the airports.  Oh, one of them is with his family.  And they're hugging.  It's a big reunion.  The other soldier's looking like, what about me?  Now the security guard at the airport's looking, going, come here.  Come here, I'll hug you.  Now they mow off in the corner.  What's that dumb little country line dance there, Doc? 
[00:22:30]  You know they dress like two Star Trek characters?  I think that's a big broad, man.  I like it.  Let's do the little dance we do.  Oh, boy.  I like it.  And then we're going to hide away.  Make you love our name.  And we can cry tomorrow.  Watch your head so much.  Oh, boy.  This is really bad.  Do you hate this song, though?  I'm getting a little douche chills. 
[00:23:00]  It's a whatever song.  I don't mind the song.  Aw.  Yay.  I like that part.  I'm a little kid.  Of course.  Now look.  They look over their shoulder as they drive away like they did at the end of Grease when  the Grease Lightning flew away, remember?  Nice.  But they don't fly in that one.  No, they get pulled, I think, by a toe.  Trailer hitch.  Yes, yes.  That fucking half a mile an hour drive that Olivia was taking.  That was hilarious.  It annoyed me so much when I watched her.  Why is she going? 
[00:23:30]  I want to ask her that.  If I'm allowed to meet her.  How slow it's going.  Yeah, look at the girl in the middle, man.  She's driving so slow.  The girl in the middle looks like Travolta.  She's on the big side.  Yeah.  Travolta guy.  That song is whatever.  Are there going to be fans here for this?  Is that what they're doing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  Are they going to pick like 20 people that are allowed to meet them?  I think so.  They'll be like a subscriber contest.  And the rest of us will not be able to look? 
[00:24:00]  Look in or anything?  On that one, you might be able to look.  Who are the celebrities we're not allowed to look at?  Oprah.  Technically.  We look at all of them, by the way.  Fuck these guys.  Oprah.  I'm sure you know.  And that's when they put up all the fucking walls, right?  Makes them uncomfortable.  They literally put up walls where you can't even get close to her.  You have to walk all the way around to get out of here.  Who else?  Wherever they're doing it.  Who else gets that status?  I don't know where they're doing it, but wherever they're doing this one direction thing is completely sealed off to any staff.  Roland said that might be their managers, too, though. 
[00:24:30]  Well, there's some rules that have been handed out.  Rules?  Yeah, what's the one?  Employees will be suspended if they do what?  No employees are allowed to be anywhere near it.  You can't bring in your kids.  You can't go look at it yourself.  Nothing like that.  I think there's a lottery where one employee gets to go.  I think that's what it was.  One employee.  A lottery.  If any other employees show up because, you know, the words get out where they're going to be.  Right.  You will be suspended.  Right.  You're not allowed to just show up.  We know where it's going to be.  It's the type of place where an employee could easily just stumble by mistake. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  And the fans are going to figure it out eventually.  That shit always gets out.  So why can't you, during your who gives a fuck life, walk by just to, you know, check out the energy?  Oh, fishbowl?  Fucking loud.  If Greenstein sees you, he's going to suspend you.  Oh, it is here?  I don't know.  Fishbowl?  Is it at the fishbowl?  Who knows?  What's the secret location?  Oh, the secret location is here?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  I'm just saying it.  The secret location is here.  When? 
[00:25:30]  When?  Because I want fucking out of here before any of this shit starts.  Who knows?  Friday afternoon?  Oh.  This Friday?  Who knows?  Who knows?  Friday afternoon.  Are we in trouble now for announcing the secret location for the One Direction thing?  I think I heard it on Ron and Fez yesterday.  Oh, you did?  I know nothing about them.  They're just a huge...  Yeah.  They're the next huge fan.  How many are there in it?  18.  I think 18 is the year.  There's 18.  They're huge for like maybe a year.  That's how that shit works.  Yeah, they did a cherry auction for somebody to win a chance to come and see them and get 
[00:26:00]  their autograph and stuff.  Yeah.  It went for $22,000.  In a year and a half, it's not...  Who's going to...  Yeah, that's just...  That's a lot, though.  Jesus Christ.  That's just...  22 grand.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  It's not a lot.  It's a rich kid's fucking father.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  Is that what that is?  Of course.  You get suspended if you bring your kids in, I guess.  You can't even be outside the building with your kid as they're walking in.  Right.  It's just...  It's going to be on lockdown.  And he'll have people watching.  And if you break the rules, supposedly you're going to be suspended. 
[00:26:30]  That's a fun, creative environment.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  That's good for creativity.  You'll be suspended.  That's good.  So that's tomorrow?  Who knows?  So tomorrow, One Direction is going to be in the building.  I will say, though...  In the fishbowl.  When you do the Tonight Show, do you know what celebrities they are like this with?  None.  None?  Not a one, huh?  No.  So if you work for the Tonight Show as just a regular Joe, you could kind of hobnob with  celebrities here and there? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you don't bother them.  And the staff knows better.  But if there's someone they really want...  Well, I think the people around here know better, too.  That's why it's so insulting.  What's with the...  Don't look, don't look, you can't do...  Only politicians.  What is that?  They're like that with politicians, where you have for security.  But I don't know what it is.  It's crazy.  It's kind of insulting to the people that work here.  Yeah.  At this point, they understand how to handle a celebrity sighting.  It's very devil's advocate.  So much temptation.  Look.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  But don't get a raise. 
[00:27:30]  What are some of the other rules?  I heard there were a whole bunch of rules.  It's been made very clear to everybody that...  Do not bring your kid to work that day.  It's not even...  It's don't bring anybody to work and stay far, far away.  No, like, there's no...  You can't go up and, like, snap a photo and throw it on Instagram or something like that.  Wouldn't that be, like...  I mean, if they're not going to pay the employees, wouldn't that be just a cool perk?  Like, oh, One Direction's here.  My daughter loves One Direction.  I'm going to bring my daughter to work and maybe she could get a glimpse of the guys. 
[00:28:00]  No.  She's not going to fucking claw at them.  Not going to happen.  Man.  I only say Roland said it might be their management.  It might be their management.  Because we do it with other people around here.  Yeah.  What if I take my Wi-Fi GoPro camera.  I stash it in there.  I could remotely control it with the Wi-Fi remote.  And then when they're in there, I'll stash it in there, you know, days before.  Right.  And then hit the fucking thing, record everything. 
[00:28:30]  Everything.  You could attach it to, like...  If that's where it is...  Yeah.  You could attach it to the banister or something upstairs above it.  Exactly.  Shoot from the ceiling.  Yes.  Yes!  I could completely fucking remotely control and get high-quality HD video, which I could  then put up online as an exclusive.  You could simulcast a lot from the compound.  Right.  In combat as it happens.  It would be huge.  That would be huge.  You'd be in so much trouble if you did that. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, really?  With who?  Who would we actually get in trouble with these days?  Manage your man.  Who would yell at me?  I think...  Bladder?  No, I think...  Go higher?  Yeah, higher than Bladder.  Higher!  Higher!  Higher!  The guy higher than Bladder doesn't care.  He's just...  He's ready to fucking...  Scott?  Would it be Scott?  Higher?  Higher!  Higher!  Higher!  Higher!  The main guy's leaving.  He don't care.  Yeah, so...  Between now and February, we could do whatever the hell we want.  You don't care. 
[00:29:30]  Mel doesn't care.  Well, all I know is they got everybody in a tizzy around here.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is like the thing.  Everybody's all nervous about it and everything.  Why?  Anybody who's anywhere closely associated with it is just in a panic.  Why?  This is the big...  David, I've never seen them make this big a deal out of anybody coming up here.  Haven't they been here before?  Yeah, but not when they're this big.  When is it?  Tomorrow?  So that means there's going to be hundreds of people outside this building tomorrow.  I'll bet.  Well, I mean, if it's here, I don't even know where it is.  It's going to be...  And that's not because of us, by the way. 
[00:30:00]  Get me the fuck out of here.  Our fans don't give a fuck about these guys.  No.  None of our fans do.  No, I'm just saying.  You got there with a One Direction sign?  I know.  And it's down and it represents his life.  Sorry.  Coke Logic.  Oh, it's going to be a zoo outside this building tomorrow.  Jesus.  And the word was already out, so don't fucking blame us.  Or Ron at Fez.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  The One Direction people, they figure this out.  They figure that shit out. 
[00:30:30]  It's 1D.  You don't say One Direction.  1D.  I say One Direction.  Better than 1N.  I guess so.  Better than any.  Right?  Right, Sam?  You with me on that?  No.  I don't think so.  I think so, yeah.  It's like Sunny D, like, you know.  Huh?  That's what the kids say.  Like Sunny Delight?  No.  Sunny D.  1D.  Oh, so it's like Sunny D.  You don't say Delight.  You don't say Direction.  Nope.  1D.  So is that what it is?  The number 1 and D?  Mm-hmm.  Like ID4 for Independence Day. 
[00:31:00]  That's exactly right.  It said ID4, which made no sense.  But like you wear a t-shirt.  It just says 1 and then D next to it.  Who's doing the interview?  The cum stain on the back of it.  The morning mashup.  So let's get them in here.  They're interviewing?  Morning mashup style.  Are they interviewing, what, One Direction?  Uh-huh.  And are they playing acoustically in here?  I don't know if they were doing that or not, for sure.  I heard they were.  They might be.  I don't know.  For sure.  I heard it was a special acoustic performance with a little interview.  I know it's an artist confidential, not a town hall.  So I don't know what happens. 
[00:31:30]  What's the difference between those two?  Is there an artist confidential?  They have people watching, right?  Fans?  Yeah.  I think they'll have a...  They had a contest that OB tried to get Twitter followers off of.  I fucking rocked that one.  Jesus.  I got at least 1,000 fucking pre-teens now following me.  Ooh.  It worked to like a charm.  But yeah, they did like...  And I never said I was giving them away.  No, you said there's a better chance.  I just said there's a better chance of winning tickets to this secret performance if you  follow me.  I never said I was giving them away. 
[00:32:00]  And then all your followers started tweeting, I just won because I followed OB.  All right.  And then they started piling in.  And then one of the morning mashup guys just retweeted me and just went, ha!  Who was it?  I think he was mad he didn't come up with this.  Oh, boy.  The one no one talks about.  Ryan?  Who's he?  Ryan?  Yeah, I guess that's his name.  Well, there's...  I don't know his name.  Rich, Stan, Nicole.  I know those three.  And Ryan.  Ryan.  Yeah, I think it was Ryan then.  He's like Zeppo Marx.  That one.  There's the Marx Brothers and then there was like Zeppo. 
[00:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I saw an opportunity and I went for it.  You did and it worked.  Follow me for a better chance to win.  But yeah, I think they'll only have like 20 people up here.  20 people?  That's all they can fit if it's up here.  Why wouldn't you take care of your staff?  You know, there's a lot of people here with daughters and nieces that would love to go  to this.  Yeah.  We should all wear 1D t-shirts and see just to watch everybody panic.  Like, they don't think they're...  Why are they wearing that?  There'd be meetings.  Yeah.  Why are they... 
[00:33:00]  What's it called?  1D?  1D.  1D.  1D.  How do you...  We should all wear 1D t-shirts.  Oh, God.  They would panic.  They would.  Why would they panic?  Why would they panic?  And we keep walking by there all day just looking.  Thumbs up-ing.  What are those guys planning?  Travolta and Olivia and John, I want to meet.  Good luck on that one.  Better than 1D?  You think you're going to do it?  That one ain't happening.  You've met some pretty popular celebrities here.  He got Gaga.  I got Lady Gaga. 
[00:33:30]  I'm friends with her opener.  I would have got her anyway.  Yeah.  I wish I was friends with her opener.  But I'm saying...  Who's her opener?  Lady Starlight, who I like a lot.  She DJed on the Zach Wilder roast.  She goes up and plays like fucking Motorhead before Lady Gaga in front of her audience.  She's great.  Really?  Yeah.  She makes it work, huh?  She does, yeah.  It's like music that that audience should not at all enjoy.  But she figures out how to make it work.  That's a talent right there.  But yeah, Lady Gaga was a rough one.  After having first been told I couldn't take a picture with it, the next time she came,  I would say they did take care of me nicely. 
[00:34:00]  And they've been good about the other ones, too.  And since then, there's been no issues.  You know, I just don't understand what the problem could possibly be.  Unless it's a time issue with some of these celebrities who keep the fuck.  Yeah, I've never seen it be a problem.  Like, the employees, maybe with their kids it's one thing, but I've never seen even big  celebrities get swamped by employees, ever.  Mike Tyson comes in.  No.  And they don't fucking...  People are very respectable as far as the people that come through.  Yeah, because here's the deal with this place.  It's not going to be this fucking throng of people from downstairs and random people. 
[00:34:30]  To even come up here, you need a reason.  So by the time you're in this fucking building, you already pretty much are qualified to take  a picture with the people.  Like, it's not going to be hours of taking pictures with people from SiriusXM.  So just stand by the dumb sign by the door.  Let the people file through and take some pictures.  You could do...  No matter who they are, as long as they work here.  And then that's it.  You could do a hundred pictures in less than five minutes. 
[00:35:00]  And you wouldn't even have to.  And it would never be a hundred pictures.  And nobody's going to act like an animal, because their boss is here.  This is where they work.  This is so stupid.  What a bunch of fucking assholes run this joint.  Jesus.  Really?  Really.  Because if you think about it, it's not like they're just throwing them to the wolves  outside the building or anything.  They're already pre-screened.  I will say this.  The difference between Sirius and XM...  XM knew how to have fun.  And didn't fucking do this shit to their employees.  Where they put up walls to make sure you don't look at Oprah. 
[00:35:30]  I'll never forget the time Elo took me and you to meet Sting.  Me and you in the back.  And I think whoever we were with, we got to meet Sting.  And he made sure we got photos.  Right.  He really took care of us, man.  It was a weird...  Robert Plant was the big one, right?  He got me an opium to watch Robert...  Yeah, you guys sit there...  You were right there watching Bobby Plant fucking play.  One of my favorite moments since going to Satellite Radio.  Me and Jimmy in some studio with Robert Plant in his bed.  That was it.  Robert Plant's giant head.  As they're sound checking. 
[00:36:00]  It was just me and you.  We were like...  Four feet?  Five feet away watching him rehearse and do his Robert Plant dance.  Here comes your buddy.  He fucking hates us, this guy.  Here comes your buddy.  And he just glares at us every day.  There he is.  He knows we're talking about it.  He just gets smirked at us.  Did he smirk?  Of course he did.  You don't say hi to him in the bathroom or anything?  No, he aggressively pushes past me and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  Never say hi to him.  Ever once.  He doesn't?  No.  Who?  Oh, interesting. 
[00:36:30]  You?  He's a dick.  Well, I suck his cock in there.  Oh, all right.  So you're kind of...  You hum high.  You think Plant liked us being in that room?  I don't know.  I think we wouldn't...  He knew that there was something, you know, not right there.  He didn't want to fucking do a sound check for just me and you.  You know what, though?  Those guys...  He wanted to do it by himself.  Those guys are so used to people being there like sound techs.  He didn't know who we were.  We could have been fans or we could have been XM employees or we could have been...  Who the fuck?  I don't even think he cared.  It's different like with musicians. 
[00:37:00]  Those guys are used to like doing them in arenas where there's people walking around.  And he was gyrating his old man hips.  He's still trying to do the moves.  Oh, yeah, he was.  Because I don't think he knows how to sing otherwise.  You know, he wasn't putting it...  He was just doing it because that's what he's been doing forever.  That's what he does.  Just moves those hips around.  So One Direction tomorrow.  Wow.  That's exciting.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, that's exciting for a lot of people.  But not me.  I was trying to get my niece to see One Direction, but then I was like, you know what? 
[00:37:30]  I'm not jumping through the hoops.  You would have to.  Well, did they say no?  I didn't even want to ask because I just know how that shit goes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There's always something.  It would just be nice to do something like that.  Yeah.  But I know everyone else is asking, but that's the type of thing you would get.  Well, I'll get you into One Direction, but can you do...  I said this the other day, but can you do 80 hours on lithium?  80 hours.  There's always something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I don't ask for shit around here. 
[00:38:00]  You're welcome.  There's always a favor that you have to now do.  They made room for one full-time employee plus a guest.  Wow.  Nice.  Just to watch, probably.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I am.  Where are they from, Australia?  England, I think.  I think they're limey.  Simon Cowell put them together.  Oh, did he?  Is that the whole fucking thing?  Is he behind them?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a smart dude, man.  Simon Cowell knows how to make money.  If I'm not mistaken, they tried out maybe for the British X Factor individually, and then 
[00:38:30]  Simon Cowell put them together as a group.  That is true.  Is it really?  He put them together as a group?  I wasn't going to say that.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah, he did.  They were individuals, and then Simon saw something.  Wait a minute.  Let's fucking put you guys together as a group.  Amazing.  So that means Simon's getting some of their money.  Some of their money.  A shitload of their money.  He probably is their...  He's probably their...  Oh, yeah.  Simon Cowell is pretty much the richest guy in entertainment.  Believe me, he's raping.  Can we hear some of them?  I don't know what they sound like, dude.  I've never heard them.  Everyone else in the room can see it.  Everyone else but you. 
[00:39:00]  Baby, you light up my world like nobody asked.  The way that you lift your head gets me overwhelmed.  But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell you.  Yay!  So.  This is great.  Beautiful.  Just dripping, hairless pussies. 
[00:39:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Groove.  This guy's good.  You've heard this song a million times.  Yeah.  It's that...  It's the formula.  Yeah.  It's that sound.  You just feel like you've heard the song before.  Yeah.  But they're not bad.  Now the main guy's dating Taylor Swift.  She's a fucking who-a.  I love her.  She gets around.  Doesn't she go out with everyone?  She is a pretty fucking girl.  Oh, she's great.  Taylor Swift, isn't she?  But all these relationships she has, they're all fake.  Why do you mean? 
[00:40:00]  What are you saying that?  She just knows how to market herself.  She's brilliant at it.  Her relationships are marketing?  Fuck yeah.  They always do this.  You don't think she actually might want some companionship?  No.  She's just going out for that?  She's career-oriented.  Yes.  How do you go from a Kennedy to one of the One Direction guys?  You just happen to fall in love with a Kennedy guy for a little while?  Well, fucking Jackie O went to her fucking Onassis.  And then that fails, and then you go to One Direction?  No, it's calculated.  Of course it is. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, they make a little deal.  Let's start hanging out a little bit.  It helps you a little bit more.  It certainly helps me more.  Which one is she?  Why do you do that all the time in Hollywood?  I think the one on the far right, this one with the hair.  Yeah.  Of course.  I want to be Scarlett Johansson's boyfriend.  You do?  Yeah.  Who else did she go out with?  Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Taylor Lautner from Twilight.  All big fucking names.  Yeah, a ton of celebrities. 
[00:41:00]  Who's she supposed to date?  A fucking construction worker?  But a radio guy, I guess.  She needs a guy that is as famous as she is.  She just happens to go out with the Twilight guy.  Those are the circles she is in.  And she was in a movie with the Twilight guy.  They must have fallen in love on the set.  And then once the movie was over.  And she's all hot.  Pop up her and this guy picture.  Where have they been?  She's doing what we would do.  She's banging famous people.  Sam makes a good point.  She goes out with the Twilight guy.  And then all of a sudden, the Twilight thing's over.  And then guess what?  The relationship's over.  She cools off.  She's a very smart woman. 
[00:41:30]  She's getting uber famous.  And she knows how to fucking market herself and use the tools at hand.  They always put Hollywood people together in fake relationships.  See?  Harry and Taylor.  Jesus.  Yeah, that'll last until One Direction drops down the charts a little bit.  She'll move on to somebody else.  1D.  She is very pretty, Taylor.  I like her music.  Yeah, me too.  Your Mean is a good song.  All her songs are awesome.  But I like that one.  It's a good song. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know all of them.  I like Your Mean.  I don't think I've ever heard that one.  Because You're Mean?  Because You're Mean?  She, uh, let me see.  Well, yeah.  She's a tall drink of water, too.  Is she?  How tall is she?  Really tall.  Because You're Mean?  She's got to be almost six foot tall.  I think she's, yeah, 5'9", 5'10".  You're not getting good pictures, Sam.  Of the two of them, it's a new thing, Anthony.  Well, fuck that.  I like Your Mean by Taylor Swift.  See, this just started.  No, let me see a picture of her.  Oh, just her?  Yeah, fine.  Like knives and swords and the weapons that you use against me. 
[00:42:30]  Have knocked me off my feet again.  Got me feeling like a nothing new.  I like this.  How do you see it?  With your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when I wounded you.  Pick one.  Oh, you're terrible.  With just one single blow.  She's crossover country?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Give a picture with her?  No, I probably could have that day, but I wasn't coming back in three hours.  I do.  You wouldn't come back for Taylor Swift?  Oh, yeah.  She's a big one.  No, you know what?  I'll get her.  I'll see her eventually.  Yeah.  She is a big one, but.  Got a good look back to that girl right there.  I'm not a huge, you know.  All you're ever gonna be is mean.  Why you gotta be so mean?  Country songs. 
[00:43:30]  She is a fucking arena monster act.  Wow.  Yeah, she's massive.  Oh, dude, she's probably making a million dollars a show.  She keeps her face in the press with these fake relationships, too.  How do you know?  Maybe she just really needs somebody to love.  Oh, my God.  They've been doing this forever.  They put people together just so it looks good.  I'd love to go out with her, though.  Like, I'm the older guy.  They'd be pulling clips of my AIDS jokes.  What is she thinking?  And she'd be like, because he's mean.  Oh.  That's not what you'd say. 
[00:44:00]  She would.  She'd be like, I like that guy.  Oh.  How do I know?  I'll break this down.  One Direction is a massive fucking...  One D.  One D.  One D.  They're traveling the world for the next probably two to three years.  Taylor Swift has her own thing going.  When are they supposed to actually date?  So they do some photo ops here and there.  They hook up in Paris and stuff.  Nah.  They were in New York together.  There you go.  This week.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then when will they see each other again?  FaceTime.  And then they'll FaceTime.  So what does she do for actual companionship? 
[00:44:30]  For cock?  She's too busy with her career.  Oh, please.  I'm telling you.  She needs some cock, dude.  I'm sure she gets it.  Where?  I don't know.  Whatever she wants it.  The paparazzi would be all over it.  You'd hear about it.  She might even be banging the one D guy, but it's not like an actual over-the-top relationship.  She looks like an angel.  She is an angel.  She looks like a little angel.  I like Scarlett better, though.  She's dating some friends.  There's pictures of her and this fucking French new boyfriend, but he's got fucking high 
[00:45:00]  waters on.  I hate him.  He's just dressing.  But look at the picture of the Daily News.  He's dressing like Troy Kwan.  He's fucking enraging.  But then again, he's banging Scarlett, so he's doing something right.  But look at his high water floods.  Look at this cocksucker.  Can you see his high waters?  Yeah, of course.  Ew.  What a douchebag.  That style's in right now.  Oh, boy.  Wow, he's fucking...  Look at her.  Oh, is that him?  Holy fuckaroni.  She's built for sex.  She met him at a tattoo artist.  She is fucking juicy.  She is a fuckstick. 
[00:45:30]  Then again, he's handsome, too.  We saw her at the Radiohead fucking show.  Look at that.  Hey, is this actually Taylor Swift topless?  No.  No, there's no actual Taylor Swift topless.  Why, man?  They stole her fucking cell phone.  Because Jim's mean.  There's no naked pics on a real Taylor Swift nude.  Come on, man.  That's her.  Right?  I have some, but they're like 12 years old.  No.  Oh, come on.  No, this is...  Look how photoshopped.  Not photoshopped.  Oh, I found a real one.  There you go. 
[00:46:00]  She's spread.  She's posing nude.  That's got to be hilarious to, like, click through shit and be like, ah, come on.  Why are the people doing that to me?  Hilarious.  Damaging.  Yeah.  Damaging, exactly.  You get an idea what she looks like, though.  You do get kind of an idea, but...  Jim, Jim...  Knowing it's fake, why is it not hot?  Like, it could be a very accurate depiction of what she looks like naked.  Sure.  But knowing it's not real, it all of a sudden isn't as hot.  Because half the fun of looking at nude photos of somebody is the violation of that person. 
[00:46:30]  Yes!  Is that it, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Do you think that she thinks the photoshoppers were mean?  Yeah.  Mom, because they're mean, you took my head and put it on a girl with meaty pussy lips because  you're mean.  That's what the song's about, imagine.  All right, why don't we eat this shit?  All right.  I think Joe Piscopo's coming in today.  He is at 9 o'clock.  Wow.  Wowie, wow, wow.  We're going to find out what he's all about.  Was she nice?  She was really nice. 
[00:47:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing here?  Just showing Jim my picture with Taylor Swift.  Let me see.  I would like it, but I could have gotten it, and I just chose not to come back.  Did she smell pretty?  She smelled pretty.  She looked pretty.  Damn it.  Her eyes are pretty.  Would it annoy you if I came back and she was like a big fan and wanted to go out with  me?  Yeah, of course it would annoy me.  Yes.  She's like, oh my god, I saw your thing.  That tranny kiss really made me like you.  Do you think she might be a big fan that wants to go out with you?  Let me see the picture.  I'm emailing it to myself so I can put it on the thing.  You don't think so, Jim?  No, although I'm friends with her best friend, but.  Who?  I don't know what I can say. 
[00:47:30]  Keep it to yourself.  Keep it private.  Yeah, I'll keep it.  I'll whisper it to you later.  I wouldn't say friends.  I just know her friend.  All right.  She'll maybe introduce me to Taylor.  We'll all go out.  It'll be fun.  Oh, look at that.  That's a shitty picture.  Clock's in the background.  That's a horrible picture of her.  It's not a horrible picture at all.  Of her?  She's frumpy in that picture.  She's slumping.  You could tell, though.  Yeah, she's kind of still hot.  Nah, she's.  I'm sorry her posture isn't what it should be.  Her posture's awful. 
[00:48:00]  You look like you barged in there to do that.  I did.  Oh, okay.  How long ago was that?  A couple years?  Nah, it's probably like a year ago.  Maybe a year and a half, doing the one question.  She's wearing a very girl-next-door-ish dress.  I know.  Frumpy dress.  She knows what she's doing.  She does, huh?  She's wonderful.  Yeah.  And that's why she goes with the fake relationship thing.  She's smart.  No fake relationship.  With me, it would be real.  You think so?  Yeah, this guy hates my ass.  I never had nobody do that.  He don't want me to shower or nothing. 
[00:48:30]  That's what she sounds like.  Yeah, he said, but he told me just to not put on deodorant.  Open my ass cheek.  I never had anybody open my butt cheek before.  Put the face in there.  Taylor Scherge is getting blacker and blacker as the impression goes on.  Put his face in my butt cheeks.  I couldn't believe it.  She keeps the innocence, though.  Yeah, he made the golden pile sound.  Even though she's getting her ass eaten, she keeps her innocence.  Yeah.  What's he doing back there?  Oh, because he's mean, you ate.  See, every joke, same thing.  All right.  We'll break.  We got a Detroit, Detroit councilwoman that, I don't know, wants Obama to do something for 
[00:49:00]  the city.  She wants Obama bucks.  And also, radio show In Trouble, they're so fucking fired.  Is it so fired?  Maybe they have different rules down there in Australia.  Aussie guys are always getting fucking in trouble on the radio.  They're crazy down there.  They might have different rules.  I don't know.  But if this happened in America, there would be panicky Pete's and these guys would be  fired.  Real Aussies or fucking Outback commercial voiceover Aussie?  No, man.  To get a stike this weekend in the ad bag of Blamein' Onion. 
[00:49:30]  I hate that guy.  Yuck, dummy.  We got the prank call that got him in trouble.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  We'll do the prank call next.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We  Couldn't Get.  Big time music star. 
[00:50:00]  Pop and Country Music Sensation.  Taylor Swift.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Taylor Swift.  Taylor, do you like grapes?  Absolutely.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts.  And One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:50:30]  Let's not forget, Joe Piscopo in studio at nine.  What did he tweet yesterday you were telling me?  Oh, yes.  He tweeted something like, I'm taking the kids.  I guess he was implying that it was warm out yesterday.  He said, I'm taking my kids to get a Christmas tree.  Bring in the sunscreen.  Be more funny.  Oh, gee.  Oh, boy.  I don't get it.  Well, it was warm out.  Oh.  You don't get your Christmas tree and need sunscreen because it's fucking December. 
[00:51:00]  But it was a nice day.  I got my first Christmas tree.  You did?  What do you mean your first Christmas tree?  I'm going with two this year.  What?  Mm-hmm.  What do you mean?  I'm getting a real tree because you have to.  Oh, not really.  And the snowing Christmas tree arrived yesterday.  You got the snowing tree?  That one that blasts fucking snow out of it?  Like a sprinkler out of the top?  Oh, and then what?  It catches it on the bottom? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, it's a big collector thing.  It can't pop.  Oh, my God.  I got this.  I got this.  You might take over the title from me as most white trashy person on this show.  I just know my kid will love it.  And then, look, it's a big thing that collects all the fake snow, and then it pushes it back  up to the center of the tree, and it continues to snow.  I don't know.  Does it have an auger?  Look, it's an upside-down umbrella that it's in.  It's so white trash.  But I know my kid will love it. 
[00:52:00]  You have to dress the umbrella up so it's different, you know, Christmassy.  Dude.  That's hilarious.  And you want to guess how much that was?  If it's anything more than $3, you were robbed.  Try about $600.  About $600.  What?  No fucking way.  Yep.  No way.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  Why so much?  I don't know.  It's very sparse.  Yeah, it's a horrible-looking tree.  It really is.  They put all their money in the technology of the damn thing. 
[00:52:30]  It looks like there's dandruff on a sad tree.  It's a sad tree with an itchy scalp.  It's a sad tree, but it snows.  Every branch has fake snow on it.  It would be better if it had something.  Here's what would make that not suck.  If they had, like, a fake something right behind it that was above it that was bringing down snow on it.  But just having the tree fucking shoot its own snow out.  Hi, I'm a tree.  I'm snowing.  Yes.  You need it to come from above the actual tree.  You're right.  Maybe that'll be the next version of this thing.  We'll figure it out.  What is the snow made of? 
[00:53:00]  It's really...  It's real snow.  It's real snow.  Anthrax.  It's, I don't know.  What does it feel like?  Is it plastic?  It's extremely light.  Paper?  Styrofoam?  Lighter than all that.  That won't get all over the floor either.  That's the beauty of it.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, it doesn't collect all the snow.  I noticed that.  Oh, no.  I noticed that in the store.  Can you turn up the volume so it's just flying out?  Yeah.  Oh.  Is it loud?  Video.  Is it loud?  No, not at all. 
[00:53:30]  Do you have the sound healing from it sucking up the snow?  Does it suck up the snow using airflow or some kind of mechanical auger?  I don't know.  I guess you've got to plug it in.  You should have come to me, Gregory.  Oh, yeah.  Ted Snowtree Emporium.  Ted.  Yes, I do, Anthony.  You're selling a snow tree this year, sir?  I certainly am.  I send one of my coworkers there.  We don't have the suck up technology.  And he by hand sprinkles flake by flake by flake by flake. 
[00:54:00]  And he has to stay there the whole time?  Yes, he does.  Do you have a rigorous screening process?  Because he's going to be in the house with children.  Yeah, it doesn't matter to me.  If you're willing to just lug up those 3,000 bags of confetti, you're more than hired.  3,000 bags?  We don't reuse confetti here in Taps Snowtree Emporium.  Wow.  That sounds inconvenient.  Yes, the man is just standing there with a ladder, and he's humming Christmas titties 
[00:54:30]  while he's sprinkling, one by one, a little bit of snow for the holidays.  How many can you sell?  Because it doesn't seem costly.  So far done, Gregory.  But I've got my hopes set high.  I need to sell 1,000 to break even.  That would suck when you have to leave the house, then a stranger is just...  The man has a bucket hooked up to his backside on a colostomy bag so he can sprinkle the joy  all evening.  He doesn't have to use the bathroom ever.  No, he doesn't, Anthony.  That's wonderful. 
[00:55:00]  You've thought this out.  I will be setting up my snowing Christmas tree today.  Oh, it's not set up yet?  Oh, okay.  Look for a quick video later today.  And you can mock me.  You can mock me.  Dude, please video the entire process of setting it up and putting it together.  Because you think I'm going to be completely annoyed?  I would absolutely see a fucking meltdown on your behalf trying to put this thing together.  I've gotten better.  I hate putting stuff together.  Yeah, that's just it.  I can't really...  It stinks, dude.  I gotta see it. 
[00:55:30]  I hate putting stuff together.  At least they don't have that hard plastic as much that'll fucking slice right through  your wrist and make it look like you're trying to kill yourself.  Oh, that stuff is...  That fucking hard plastic that molds around everything.  They're finally getting past that, and I know why.  Because too many people probably cut the shit out of themselves.  Too many lawsuits.  That's crazy.  So now they go with the twist ties.  Yeah.  Everything is twist tied.  I like a good fucking Christmas...  Decorative Christmas house.  Yeah.  I like that shit.  I don't know why, but I do.  I may get a tree this year because I'm having my... 
[00:56:00]  Aww.  No, no.  Because you're going to have your ass...  I'm having my apartment painted.  Finally.  And then it'll start next week.  What color?  I have a couple of colors.  I didn't choose them.  A designer helps me.  A gay gentleman?  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Go with that really uncomfortable yellow slash orange.  You can't possibly ever repaint over.  You can't focus...  Bleeds right through.  You can't focus on anything.  You stare at the wall for a second, and then you can't see for the rest of the day. 
[00:56:30]  Get one of those colors.  When you walk into my apartment, it's going to be a little bit of white right there.  And the walls...  Eggshell white?  There's a lot of whites.  No, I forget the whites.  It's a lot of whites.  And on the ceiling, it's going to be a light, a weird blue color.  They taught me in a painting two of my ceilings, like a different color, which is different.  I like it.  I like it.  I'm getting fucking new drapes and shit.  Could you look up how many different whites there are?  Because you're bringing back a memory.  When I had a designer help us out when I got my place, I'm like, yeah, I want white walls 
[00:57:00]  because I don't want to compete with the view.  And they're like, well, what kind of white?  It almost drove me nuts because then they put sample whites on the wall so you could  pick which white you want.  I'm having Gentleman Gray in my bathroom.  But shouldn't white just be white?  How is there different whites?  That doesn't even seem possible.  Look, there you go.  There's all the whites and they all look white.  What are the names of some of the whites, though?  That's what I want.  There's Eggshell.  There's...  All the whites quickly. 
[00:57:30]  Really quickly.  Anti-Flash White, Beige, Cosmic Latte, Cream, Eggshell, Isabeline, Ivory, Magnolia.  And the whitest is the Kumi of White.  There's the joke.  Now we can move on.  All right.  Steven from Bayshore writes, holy shit, are you guys actually advertising a laser comb  to regrow hair?  And then writes, incredible.  Are we?  Is that our latest advertiser, Iraq?  Do you think we listen?  I don't know.  Let me take a look.  Well, Steven S. from Bayshore certainly would not be making up shit. 
[00:58:00]  We're very busy prepping for the program in between segments.  Right.  So we don't normally listen to the advertisers.  Stop.  Are we?  Laser comb?  What's a laser comb?  That sounds like complete horse shit.  No.  Is it like that?  What's the laser comb?  Is it like that?  What is it?  It's called the Hairmax Laser Comb.  Hairmax.  We stink. 
[00:58:30]  Hairmax Laser Comb.  Oh, I'm sure it's very safe and effective.  So don't mock it.  There's before and afters right here.  The website says, seeing is believing.  Like, you can mock it all you want, but that guy has no hair, and then he used a comb, and  now he's got hair.  Oh, shit.  That's a female first.  It may work.  That's a dude down there, then.  A male.  That's a dude down there.  And he's got hair now.  Well, how does the laser comb work?  It's stimulating the hair follicles?  It's good for pushing the hair forward. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, it's supposed to do some kind of follicle stimulation.  We've always had crazy advertisers, so this is not unusual.  I've got to tell you, over at Men's Hair Now, over at Bosley Center, after they do the implantation  of individual hair follicles harvested from the harvest area and put in micro grafts, they 
[00:59:30]  then do this lasery thing to your head.  But at that point, you just know, like, all right, that's all I wanted to do.  It's done.  Oh, they want you to come back for the lasery thing?  Yes, they want you to come back for the mumbo jumbo.  Oh, they have some mumbo jumbo.  It's like, no, I paid for this.  That's what I got.  Very happy.  Thank you.  No mumbo jumbo.  What's the lasery thing?  You sit under a thing that looks like a hair dryer, but it's a laser thing.  And what is that supposed to do? 
[01:00:00]  If you've got the implants or whatever the fuck.  Stimulate the follicles.  But if that worked, then you wouldn't need the operation or the procedure.  Doesn't that sound right?  I don't know.  I didn't come back for the lasers.  And you're fine.  It shows.  Fine.  And it shows.  Anthony's hair looks really good.  Are you still happy with it?  Oh, it's wonderful.  It looks great.  I'm very happy with it.  He looks great.  How many did you have put in?  Two, three?  10,000 follicles.  Wow.  I don't know what it was. 
[01:00:30]  I had the maximum that you could do in one sitting.  Yeah.  Where they grab it and then they just throw it in.  And it's fine.  You know?  It's age appropriate.  What do you mean?  Well, you don't.  It's fucked up when guys go and get the fucking, you know, they get all the giant full head  of fucking like those Mexican guy hairlines down to the eyebrows.  Yeah.  That shit looks stupid.  Yeah.  Just add just a tiny bit maybe.  That's it.  You don't go all in. 
[01:01:00]  Hop it in there.  As long as it's covered, that's fine.  All right.  We got a radio station, radio show in trouble.  Right.  I have not heard the call.  I know.  And it's Australia, so they have different rules because I'll say it again.  You're really not allowed to do prank calls anymore.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  I guess technically.  Well, this was vetted by a lawyer.  Huh?  Their lawyers vetted.  It wasn't aired live.  Vetter?  It was vetted by others.  What do you mean it wasn't aired live?  This was aired but not live. 
[01:01:30]  Of course, their lawyers went over it and said it was okay.  So they're probably not in trouble.  Oh, fuck.  Then they're going to skate.  Look at the tits on this one.  I know.  Like two big blooming onions at the ad bank.  So you got the, what?  You got Prince William.  Prince Bill.  And Kate.  They're expecting a baby and for some reason Kate's in the hospital.  What's that about?  Yeah.  What is that about?  What's that about?  They're hoping it's not a dud. 
[01:02:00]  You missed our whole dud.  I mean.  A dud.  Secretly, I think a lot of people are hoping for a dud just to see what the royal family  would do and how they would handle it.  With like a fucking, you know, uh-oh.  They must have some kind of protocol.  Tragically.  Yeah.  Has there ever been a dud in the royal family?  That's never not is the question.  I'm sure.  All right.  Where are those people?  The inbreeding that goes on in, um.  So where are those people?  Where are they? 
[01:02:30]  Oh, man.  Um.  You've never heard of a dud.  No, I think they put them in that Tower of London there.  They lock them up.  They lock them up a little bit?  Yeah.  They say, you stay here now.  And they're like, oh, okay.  Well, she's in the hospital.  Do we know why?  I've heard, like, extreme morning sickness is what I read.  Oh, wow.  Extreme morning sickness.  Like our listeners get.  Her body's trying to get rid of that fucking boring load.  Yeah.  Look at that Abby Huntsman.  She looks pretty good.  That her in the middle?  Yeah.  Fuck, she's beautiful. 
[01:03:00]  That's what I need.  I want to be Abby Huntsman's boyfriend.  Abby Huntsman's, from the Huffington Post, I guess.  She's beautiful.  She got a husband calling?  No, no, no, no.  No?  Hi, Abby.  Jay, what are you doing, man?  Go say hi to Abby.  You want that to happen?  Like, hi, Jimmy.  I'm a big fan.  I came down.  I saw you at the cellar.  And you're so funny.  You're like, oh, you want to go out for a call?  I would love to.  She goes, yeah, you know, it's funny.  Me and my friends at the Huffington Post, I was trying not to laugh at the big clit stuff.  Because it just resonated. 
[01:03:30]  I'm like, really?  She's like, yes.  My nickname was airbag pussy when I was growing up.  Yeah, she's a pretty girl.  Good call.  You just found my wife.  Pretty girl.  Why don't you tweet her?  Yo, what's up, baby?  Can we just play it from there?  This is the apology confession thing after.  Apology.  Oh, fuck that.  All right.  So she's in the hospital.  Stike and shrimp at the end, dick.  They were able to get to her room? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, they got through to her room and talked to a nurse.  That's crazy.  Doing bad Queen Elizabeth impression.  Did they actually talk to Kate?  No.  Oh, then what's the big deal with this?  They talked to her nurse and her nurse gave all kinds of details about what she was doing in there.  Oh, man.  That nurse is so dead.  Over the years, we've tried to talk to the president.  We've talked to people in the White House.  We talked to people at Graceland.  So if you're not talking to the actual person, who cares?  Doesn't matter.  Why are they in trouble? 
[01:04:30]  Getting a lot of info that they weren't supposed to have, I suppose.  Let's give this hospital a call and see if we can get Kate Middleton or maybe even Prince Wills on the phone tonight.  So the number's going in.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez, I hope this happens.  What a dumb ring.  What a dumb European ring.  Like they're fucking sirens.  Oh, hello there.  Could I please speak to Kate, please, my granddaughter?  Oh, yes.  Just hold on. 
[01:05:00]  Thank you.  Are they putting us through?  Yes.  Whacky.  If this has worked.  Shook jokes.  It's the easiest prank call we've ever made.  Your accent sucked, by the way.  I just want you to know.  I'm not used to playing old 80-year-olds.  I invented radio.  Kate, my darling, are you there?  Good morning, Mum.  This is a nurse speaking. 
[01:05:30]  How may I help you?  Hello.  I'm just after my granddaughter, Kate.  I want to see how her little tummy bug is going.  Mummy.  She's sleeping at the moment, and she has had an uneventable night, and sleep is good  for her, as we speak.  She's been getting some fluids to rehydrate her, because she was quite dehydrated when she  came in.  But she's stable at the moment.  Okay.  I'll just feed my little corgis, then.  Okay, fired lady.  So when is a good time to come and visit her, because I'm the queen, so I need a lift down 
[01:06:00]  there.  Prince!  Charles!  Mummy, is everything okay?  Oh, wait.  My Charles book.  Oh, fuck.  Now they're doing like a fucking little pit.  No, but you know what?  I'm listening closely.  I'm suspicious.  It might be fake.  No.  This is not the royal.  Really?  They're fucking, yeah.  They're in trouble.  No, this is real.  All right.  Fair enough.  I like, that's why I like the idiocy they're doing.  Yeah.  Because it, it, how does the nurse listen to this and believe it?  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Charles.  Mummy, is everything okay?  Wait, my Charles. 
[01:06:30]  When can you take me to the hospital, Charles?  I don't know.  When, when will it be all right to come down and see her?  Maybe, maybe in the morning or something, if that's okay.  I would suggest that any time after nine o'clock would be suitable, because the doctor  will be in in the morning.  Okay.  And we'll just be getting her freshened up in the morning.  I would think any time after nine.  Wonderful.  And is, is Will's, is Will's still there?  Has he gone home?  I haven't spoken to him yet.  He went home at about half past nine last night.  No, it's actually probably about nine o'clock last night.  Okay.  Lovely.  But they're all okay.  Everything's all right.  Yes. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  She's quite stable at the moment.  She hasn't had any retching with me since I've been on duty.  Retching.  And she has been sleeping on and off.  Wonderful.  I think it's difficult sleeping in a strange bed as well.  Yes, of course.  It's hardly the palace, is it?  Oh, it's nothing like the palace, isn't Charles?  That's kind of funny.  I like his voice now.  Oh, it's making me laugh.  I turned the corner too.  It's not quite the palace, is it?  Yeah, what's everybody having to hear, crumpets?  And she has been sleeping on and off.  Wonderful. 
[01:07:30]  I think it's difficult sleeping in a strange bed as well.  Yes, of course.  It's hardly the palace, is it?  Oh, it's nothing like the palace, is it, Charles?  And when are you going to walk those bloody cargis?  Muncie, I'll go and take the dogs outside.  I need to go visit Kate in the morning.  My dear, thank you so much.  You're very welcome.  Thank you.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  She was giving us real information.  Mumsy, I think that they believed everything that we just said.  I am the queen.  Bow for me. 
[01:08:00]  Bow for me.  Bow for you and your terrible accent.  Are they going to some fucking music?  Yeah.  Oh, excuse me.  Could I speak to the queen, please?  I sat on a crown and got stuck up my butt.  I've got a retching princess on my bed. 
[01:08:30]  Get it?  Oh, retching.  I would have said, oh, could I speak to Kate Middleton?  This is the media.  Tell Lady Diana we're sorry about hitting the tunnel wall and stuff.  Prince Chipperson's hilarious.  Have some tea and crumpets or something.  Or something.  Or somewhere.  All right, well, they did a good job with that.  They turned me around.  They got him some press.  Look at that. 
[01:09:00]  We're in the U.S. talking about him.  The guy looks a little bit like Jim Brewer.  Does he?  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear them talking about it?  Chick's got big Australian tits.  Yeah, let's see.  They apologize.  She's got some big feeders.  So is this the apology?  Because they got so much press.  I love how radio guys have to apologize after they get a lot of press.  Dumb companies.  It's so stupid.  You should be praising them at that point.  Huge, huge show tonight on the Summer 30 Countdown.  Samantha Jay, she's going to be here tonight performing her brand new single,  Do you know what you've done to me live? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, the hotness of life.  Why do they have a visual element?  They're just nobodies in Australia.  Look at this.  Why can't we have this?  Maybe they're huge.  Their agent, I guess, worked it out.  Doing the whole 30 Countdown.  Yeah.  I mean, they didn't just have a camera in there.  No, but it's a good, it's an HD camera.  Yeah, that's all we need.  That's all you need is a couple of cameras.  I don't even give a fuck if it's just a long shot that people could, you know, check  out every once in a while. 
[01:10:00]  There's real money to be made by that, too.  Should have made it.  I got frustrated.  Bob always has an excuse why it can't happen.  He's very good at coming up with excuses.  Well, this place is real shitty with the whole thing, too.  I mean, obviously, but all parties involved, because trying to get them to make a move.  Yeah, make a move.  Of course.  That's why I can't wait for the new guys.  I'm more than willing to take my fucking chance. 
[01:10:30]  They have a problem with exclusivity on this fucking here.  So, okay, let's say we have this, right?  Right.  We have a visual element to this program.  How are they going to monetize it?  How do they monetize it?  How do you keep people from tuning into that and getting our show without paying for the  subscription price?  They don't see that in 2012 you cannot only be in one place and be culturally relevant? 
[01:11:00]  Well, I'll tell you what they're missing is this obsession with exclusivity and content  control.  That's why.  You make advertising money.  But make it subscription-based.  You have to pay for it.  We don't have enough people that would pay a couple bucks to see some video of what's  going on in the studio.  Well, you just put a little advertising with it, or what CBS even understands that this  place doesn't, even though that's not subscription-based, is that the more people that see your product,  the more people become interested in it, and you're getting your name, it's like the more 
[01:11:30]  people that want to be a part of it.  Do you think in any way, shape, or form that fits any business model they've run through  their fucking little people and tests and fucking focus groups, do you think us going  to them and saying, we need a visual element, we want to make it subscriber-based, people  can subscribe, go online, watch us, they don't have a concept of whether that can be monetized  or not how it is, so they're never going to say yes.  Well, you have to go to them and say, well, here's the deal. 
[01:12:00]  If everything is videotaped high quality, look at the mustard video, it got over 7 million  views.  The Jesse Ventura argument got over a million views.  Bad, bad, crap!  But all of these things can be very, very good for business.  All of these things, if done right, but it's just, it's so fucking frustrating.  And then you look at Nick and Artie, and I know that DirecTV syndicates their show, which  makes it easier.  Definitely. 
[01:12:30]  But that's the way to get it done.  That's what they do.  They do a great job, their fucking agent did a great job.  Liberty owns what?  DirecTV?  Liberty.  So maybe we got a shot when Liberty comes in.  Maybe.  That's just it.  Liberty owns Dish.  Dish.  So maybe we have a shot when Liberty comes in, maybe.  I don't even know if they control that closely, though.  Like, if they're the type of guys that get involved, or if they're just the overall parent  company, I don't know, man.  Yeah, we'll see.  When is the Liberty thing going down?  February.  We could do something, though, if we really, I'm sure, wanted to.  If all of us put our heads together and said, this is what we want, and gave them a proposal. 
[01:13:00]  We tried.  The three of us have to sit down.  Good luck.  And really do it.  With this company, I don't see it ever happening.  I've fucking been through enough shit with them over exclusivity and video that it's fucking  bizarre.  They don't want to hear from it.  It's crazy.  I'd love it.  Believe me.  This would be great.  We get some HD cameras up in this nigga and fucking have a good time.  It'd be great.  We were moving on, and I mean, my manager was talking to them and everything, and then  it just got to be frustrating. 
[01:13:30]  And I said, fuck it.  Concentrate on me doing a stand-up thing.  I can't make this happen.  I'm not going to, you know.  Yeah, we had an opportunity to do kind of a TV thing, right?  Yeah.  I'm not saying it's gone, either.  The opportunity is not necessarily gone.  There was a lot of interest, but they're not, really.  But Bob did what he could, but he didn't get as involved as he could have, probably.  Um, we would all have to just sit down in a room and say, this is what we want, 100%,  and do it.  100%?  All right.  Well, here's the, here's the Australian show talking about the prank. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, gee.  Hit it.  Alarm's going off as well.  Hotness alarm.  Roo, roo.  It's enough.  Hotness alarm.  The boys from Neighbours are going to be here as well, and, uh, this, this happened  today.  Hoaxers called pretending to be the King and Queen.  And rang Queen Edward VII Hospital to check on Kate's condition.  And they managed to get put through to Kate's wall.  Can you believe what has happened today?  You know what?  They were the worst accents ever, and when we made that phone call, we were sure 100 people 
[01:14:30]  at least before us would have tried the same thing.  If you're wondering what's happened, a couple of nights ago, we called the hospital where  Kate Middleton is staying, pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.  This isn't really an apology.  This is them crowing about their victory.  We were expecting to be hung up on what you didn't know what to say.  We got through.  We got put through, and now the entire world is talking.  Of course, it is a countdown as well.  Not the entire world.  It's built by your votes as we cross out of the phone room to find out what's on its  way to number one.  Yeah, let's cross to the corgis. 
[01:15:00]  What's on its way?  Uh, uh, another fellow Brit, Olly Murs.  All right, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  Look at their studio.  I'm going to lose my fucking mind.  Look at their studio.  Why?  Because they have a camera?  They got a giant studio.  Did you see the studio, too?  It's amazing.  Of course.  Looks like the bridge of the enterprise.  Their studio looks like the bridge of the enterprise.  Look at this.  It's fantastic.  It's just a shitty show in Australia.  Oh, man.  We're hurting Australia.  They're not hurting America.  Australia's very big.  Maybe they just got my room.  Fuck.  It's just embarrassing.  It's embarrassing. 
[01:15:30]  This studio is embarrassing.  Aw.  Yeah, it is.  This was supposed to be fun.  They pan.  They're in, they're in one section of this fucking compound.  It's giant.  And they go, all right, let's see what's going on today on the show.  So they, they pan the camera to this giant fucking broadcast area.  It's wonderful.  This studio is embarrassing.  This small studio.  What happened with that?  What does Gary say in those meetings that are useless? 
[01:16:00]  The ones that I'm in?  Yeah.  We never talk about the studio.  Did you talk about the green room situation that Steven Sandler brought up?  Why?  We don't talk about that stuff in the meetings that I'm in.  We just go around the room and say we're doing bits.  A little shtick.  Some bits.  Yeah.  Repurposing.  Here, pan.  Show the pan again.  All right.  For us, anyway, because we're not allowed to show anything.  Show the pan!  Look at that.  That's all.  Keep it there.  What's on its way?  Uh, another.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, my God. 
[01:16:30]  It's nice.  Look at it.  It's roomy.  You can get bands in there.  You can do actual bits without bumping into each other.  Another reason why we don't really do bits anymore, we don't have the room for it.  It's almost impossible to do anything in this studio.  Oh, this studio that Patty could sing is fucking embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  It was supposed to be temporary, too.  They tricked us.  Was it, though?  Mm-hmm.  I honestly never, ever recall them saying that they were going to do anything for us as far 
[01:17:00]  as the studio was.  Yeah, I don't either.  I mean, I know, Bob.  You weren't in on those conversations.  They absolutely said to my face, we just want to get you over here.  I said, this is not enough room for us.  And they're like, well, this is the best we could do right now, but we'll certainly try  to figure out something better for you guys.  I remember them saying, here's your studio.  Occasionally, if you want, you could use the fishbowl, but there really isn't any other  facility in here for you guys.  They said they would try to figure it out.  Really?  Absolutely.  Wow. 
[01:17:30]  Right to my face.  I was coming in here every day to help fucking design this place.  They tried to figure it out.  And I said, look, even though you're doing the right thing and you got rid of a lot of  shit in this actual studio, we need more.  I said, all right, at the very least, just take down the wall.  Yeah.  And then they said they couldn't take down the wall because there's some kind of fucking  that bitch of a bearing wall.  Well, then during negotiations, they go, well, I pointed out a couple of the studios that  would actually work for us.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And nothing.  Isn't Shade 45 much bigger than this? 
[01:18:00]  No.  It's just probably about the same design a little different.  No, it's bigger.  Isn't it, Sam?  It's all bigger.  It might be a little bit much bigger.  Okay.  Yeah, whatever.  It's a bit bigger.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  I thought it was, but yeah, there's just no room to, there's nothing, and we've said  it before, there's nothing when you walk into this studio that says that this room means  anything special.  There's nothing in this that says the company feels any differently about this room than 
[01:18:30]  it does about any other room, which is why Stern is a fucking genius, and it's fucking  people the geniuses, because they know how to get what they want.  Half the builder.  Half, but you know what?  Fucking good for that motherfucker's agent.  Good for that agent to be able to fucking pull that off.  Should we wake up Bob and ask him?  Oh, boy.  We can ask him.  Yippee.  You don't know if you don't ask.  I went through the frustrating rings enough time, and I was just done with it. 
[01:19:00]  That's why I just get so annoyed when I see Gary or Steve or the cross-eyed guy outside  the studio.  I forget his name.  I'm sorry.  You know his name is Rob.  Rob.  And he doesn't have crossed eyes.  His name is Rob Cross.  Oh, that's why.  I know his eyes are a little wacky.  I just didn't know what was wrong with him.  That's why I don't like talking to him after the show, because it's just nonsense talk.  Let's talk about the real shit. 
[01:19:30]  Nice big fucking studio.  That's not going to happen.  You got to see the look.  We should have a montage of the looks that the celebrities give when they come in here.  They look around like, I heard about these guys.  And they look around like, what?  Maybe their studio is being remodeled or something.  They think this is just your temporary spot?  Yeah.  Well, the wallpaper just kind of velcroed on, so maybe this isn't their full-time place.  Well, look.  It's falling down over there. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, this must just be temporary digs.  Top of the table is dirty.  It's just a fucking embarrassment.  Why hasn't the Radio Wizard noticed that this piece has been hanging for months?  Yeah, I mean, months and months.  You guys are going to yell that.  Why don't you guys check and make sure that everything's up there?  I know, now it'll be your problem.  The way it's supposed to be.  That's why we can't really bring this stuff up, because then it's the guy's problems.  Well, then you didn't fix it.  The upholstery does kind of, you know, fall under your... 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, they're upholstery.  I don't know.  Too fucking much.  Well, good for the Australian radio show.  Good for them.  They've got an amazing facility.  Amazing.  Amazing.  That's something.  Oh, well.  Good for them.  Little motherfuckers.  We had an Australian guy on the show at one time.  It was the wrong guy, but we had him on.  Corey.  Yeah.  It was Corey from Australia.  That's how you executive produce.  Now it's done.  Bye. 
[01:21:00]  Stay the way.  All right.  Is there any more video?  That was it for them?  That was it.  They got right back into the countdown.  They just announced that they did.  Why did it say they apologized?  On our sheet, it said they apologized.  They didn't apologize.  There might have been an apology statement, but that was what was on the air.  They were crowing, man.  Good for them.  They got some press.  Very good.  Yeah, we'll see.  Yeah, what is the apology statement?  I mean, because it said in our...  working, working, working. 
[01:21:30]  Why would the webpage come up quickly?  Is that them right there?  Oh, boy.  We were very surprised that our call was put through.  We thought we'd be hung up on as soon as they heard our terrible accents.  We're very sorry if we caused any issues, and we're glad to hear that Kate is doing well.  That's fine.  They're fine.  That's all right.  I ain't bad.  That's just to shut the fuck up, we said him.  Right.  Right.  Meow. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, good for them.  All right, we got a lady in Detroit who wants Obama's help.  What's going on with this fiscal cliff?  I see a lot of people went home for the weekend, right?  Oh, boy.  They usually leave on Thursday.  I heard they started leaving yesterday.  This is not...  The two sides can't work together.  That's wonderful.  They can't work together.  They won't work together.  Whatever side you're on, I mean, it's depressing that they can't even work together to figure shit out.  Well, Obama's whole take on the thing is he's not making any deal, any deal that does not include taxing the wealthiest of Americans, as he's called them. 
[01:22:30]  And the Republicans are saying, no, that's bad to do in this economy when the economy is struggling to get back on its feet.  You don't raise taxes on the job creators and whatnot.  And that if they want any kind of revenue stream coming in, it should be that the wealthiest of Americans, perhaps some of the loopholes, the tax loopholes in tax laws, some ways that they could deduct things, should be reallocated and get your revenue that way. 
[01:23:00]  And then, of course, budget cuts also go through.  But I don't think Obama wants that, and they're just never going to come to an agreement.  So what's going to happen is that all of the Bush-era tax cuts will expire, and the taxes will then go up on everybody, the wealthiest of Americans, middle class. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, everybody except that 47% freeloaders that don't pay any taxes.  Is it really 47%?  I don't know.  I actually don't know exactly.  And then you get people going, no, they pay taxes on this and that.  We're talking like federal income tax, you know, things like that, payroll tax.  Those taxes, the big taxes.  But taxes will go up on everybody. 
[01:24:00]  I got my latest city tax yesterday.  Yeah.  17 Gs.  Isn't that nice?  And I don't pay enough.  You don't pay enough.  You were talking about the private school yesterday and saying that it would be 21 Gs a year.  For a three-and-a-half-year-old.  How about this?  I don't have a kid.  My school taxes are $26,000 a year.  Get the fuck out of here.  That is for my school tax.  That isn't even my property tax, which is above bill. 
[01:24:30]  How are we not paying enough?  That's a lot of fucking money.  How are we not paying enough?  It's unbelievable.  I don't pay enough.  And then there's my state tax.  Yes.  I got two installments of $13,000 every year.  Wow.  $26,000 to pay for schools that I don't even really utilize.  I guess it's so, you know, the proper element is in my neighborhood.  That's good.  The schools are very expensive.  And I don't get...  Well, for you, it's like match.com. 
[01:25:00]  I mean, there's just no logic in this country anymore.  If you don't have kids, why the fuck were they able to pass this where you have to still pay for a school tax?  Yeah.  And they do look at it like, well, you want good schools in your...  Yeah, because of property value.  Blah, blah, blah.  Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  But I was thinking that.  It's like, Jesus Christ, I pay more than I would pay for a private school.  They figured out, you know, if you live in Manhattan, to give you another tax.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  I got federal, state, and city.  How many cities have that?  I don't know.  Not a lot, right?  I don't know.  Does anyone know the answer to that question?  I know that it's not a lot, but it's ridiculous.  I do not know.  Hmm.  Ah, we're just fucking up this country.  We're just fucking it up.  It's amazing.  No one knows what they're doing down there in Washington.  They really don't.  They'd rather spend time just arguing back and forth over and over again instead of trying  to work shit out.  Then another tax went into play.  Properly.  Everybody's talking about the fiscal cliff and Obama wanting to just tax the wealthy. 
[01:26:00]  He campaigned on that.  And the truth of the matter is, everyone's taxes are fucking going up.  It's crazy.  And regardless of whether they can agree on the Bush tax cuts or not.  And what do we get?  What do we get for it?  Yeah.  No, the average American citizen, not just us.  Yeah.  Well...  What are we going to get?  Oh, it's supposed to bring down the debt, the deficit. 
[01:26:30]  That's not going to happen.  We didn't do that.  And it's not enough, by the way.  You're talking a few billion dollars in revenue.  We weren't irresponsible with our spending.  They did that.  They completely fucked that up.  So that comes down.  So then what happens?  I don't know.  Exactly.  The capital gains taxes, by the way, if you're an investor, are going up to pay for Obamacare.  That just hit the news the other day in a little more detail than was out there before. 
[01:27:00]  But, yeah, if you invest and you make money in the stock market, in your investment plans, in your portfolio, they will be raising the taxes on that.  And it will go to this thing that isn't supposed to cost us that much money, the Obamacare.  Of course.  I got a brother that was a Wall Street dude.  Black guy?  Black guy.  Oh, I get you.  And he did very well.  He did very well.  Made a very good living.  And then through companies going under and this and that, he survived for a while. 
[01:27:30]  And then he got the fucking axe, right?  Yeah.  So then he went home and started day trading.  And he does very well day trading.  And in the last at least year, maybe longer, he's had many offers to go back to Wall Street.  Yeah.  And he goes, it's not worth it anymore.  He goes, it's just not worth it.  I'd rather stay home, day trade, and just fucking hang out with my family.  But he's going to get fucked, too, because...  Well, of course.  But he said actually having a job down there.  Yeah.  Like old school.  He goes, it's not worth it to me anymore. 
[01:28:00]  It just isn't.  If you're banging stocks out on a daily basis and trading, but you're only holding stocks less than six months, the tax rate on that capital gains is insane.  They're going to take half your fucking money away.  It's ludicrous that they would do that.  And that's not even going to take care of the problem, I hear.  No, no.  It's a temporary fix.  It's like a little Band-Aid, right?  The rate that this country is going into debt, and the debt we're already at, $16 trillion, over $16 trillion, this raising of taxes on the wealthiest of Americans, it's not going to cover a little fucking dent it's not going to put in that. 
[01:28:30]  I mean...  So eventually, what, we have to have a huge war?  I don't know.  Something's got to give.  But the truth of the matter is, he will raise taxes on everybody, eventually.  You can't just keep fucking skimming off of the wealthy, the villainous, horrid, not doing their share, wealthiest of Americans. 
[01:29:00]  You know, the people that have achieved what is supposedly the American dream, making something of yourself, getting comfortable in life, being able to afford some of the finer things.  You're a fucking insufferable prick if you do that, and you're supposed to be villainized and not hold on to it.  You've got to give it away and help other people in this country.  I agree, thank you.  Now, is this true?  Someone just Twittered, and while you don't pay enough, the heads of the EPA just paid $180 grand for official office portraits. 
[01:29:30]  That makes sense.  I'm sure.  The amount of tax money that goes to complete horse shit, and sometimes it's like, oh, it's only $100 grand, you know?  And in terms of trillions of dollars, it's really nothing.  But that's where the trillions come from, because there's so much of that shit going on.  And then you hear Obama saying, you know, and the Democrats about the military budget being cut. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, he's going to really cut a fuckload out of the military budget.  And people don't realize, like, man, the military gets so much money.  Do you know how many people the military employs in the private sector even?  And not even, like, fucking, you know, contractors and, like, everybody has some fucking foot in the military till, hand, excuse me, foot in the door. 
[01:30:30]  It's just amazing.  I just don't understand why the government has to keep looking toward us for more money.  Because it's not their money when they waste it.  It's amazing.  I mean, they're obviously wasting so much fucking money irresponsibly.  It really is amazing.  Yesterday, because we have an OTB in our neighborhood.  She goes, did the OTB close down?  I go, yeah, a while ago now.  She goes, oh, because they still have the letters outside.  She was just wondering, you know.  I'm like, yeah, that tells you everything you need to know about the government.  Yeah.  They couldn't make off-track betting profitable. 
[01:31:00]  Well, gambling's not usually lucrative.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That's what Vegas does.  Look at how Vegas makes it work.  But that's all you need to know about your government.  They couldn't make OTB work.  Government was in charge of off-track betting.  And they couldn't even fucking figure it out.  It's because of the unbelievable costs that the government has to run anything.  Like, when you're a business, you try to bring your costs down and your profits up.  And stay in the black and everything's fine and dandy. 
[01:31:30]  The government doesn't even seem like they have any interest in cutting their spending.  It's like a club where they have an unlimited till to draw from that never ends because all they've got to do is keep asking people for more money.  Why shouldn't this guy in this state get millions of dollars?  Because there's this never-ending fucking pile of cash.  Right.  It's astounding.  Because it's not theirs.  They don't care.  They haven't earned it. 
[01:32:00]  They don't have any interest in it.  So they keep spending it.  I hate them all, man.  Fucking pricks.  I know it's such an easy thing to say is just to say I hate them all.  But that's really where I'm at, man.  Oh, it's infuriating.  It really is angering.  They want us to make sacrifices, more sacrifices.  But when do they make their own sacrifices?  The portraits.  On their spending.  The vacations on our dime.  The travel.  The fucking...  All that shit.  The waste.  The waste that goes into even, like, deciding on a bidder for a contract. 
[01:32:30]  Like, everyone's in there with their arms patting each other on the back just grabbing our fucking money with zero accountability.  No one really knows where any of this shit's going.  They have this official fucking tally of stuff, but no one's checking it.  There are watchdog groups, but even they don't have access to a lot of the shit.  It's a big fucking bullshit fest.  Where the fuck... 
[01:33:00]  They must just laugh at us.  They must shut those doors on the hill and just chuckle their ass off at the American worker.  It's the vacations and things like that one that came out.  And people get fired when it becomes public.  But what do you think?  That's the only one that happens?  This waste of our...  And that's why I fucking hate when my taxes go up.  Not because I don't want to help poor people.  Right.  But because that's where my money is going.  It's being wasted by a bunch of cocksuckers.  You know they're not spending it properly.  Yeah, of course.  That's why it drives you nuts.  I pay a lot in taxes.  And no, I don't want my taxes to go up. 
[01:33:30]  And like Jimmy said, if I thought for a second that the taxes I'm already paying were actually going to better the country in a way, build up the infrastructure, you're on a...  You know when you go over that stretch of road that's just been paved and you come off of like an old cement shitty road and you go...  And you're like, oh, fuck.  The amount of money...  That's nice.  Imagine every road like that.  Well, I was going to say, the amount of money we pay, at the very least, every road should be like that.  Like shit like that.  Every road.  And just...  Our bridges are ready to fall down. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, bridges.  Especially the one in London.  And those make jobs.  Oh, falling down, falling down, falling down.  They're looking the other way.  But we got major issues with the infrastructure of this country.  And it would pay for things.  Big civic projects.  And this is shit that, I mean, even Obama was talking about, but it never comes to fruition.  The pipeline project.  The Keystone Pipeline from Canada.  I mean, do it, you fucking idiots.  Well, you know what the holdup is.  They're afraid they can't get enough tobacco to put it. 
[01:34:30]  Pipe.  Pipe.  After the break, we're going to have...  I thought the wacky cops spinning their billy clubs that don't know how to build it.  Keystone cops.  Yes, I got it.  Those are the old silent movie police.  No, I know, but what's I got to do with them?  The Keystone Pipeline.  Oh, I didn't know that.  See there.  All right.  Yeah, what are you, a Keystone?  What's that open rocks?  I mean, but things like that, it employs people. 
[01:35:00]  It puts the money back into the American infrastructure.  It creates innovation, new ways of doing things.  But it just doesn't get done.  And Obama leaves for vacation.  Yeah.  21-day vacation, December 17th.  Yeah, 4 million bucks.  It's going to cost the American taxpayers.  Thank you.  He wants us to sacrifice.  Wouldn't that be a great statement if he somehow says...  Did no vacation. 
[01:35:30]  No vacation or whatever.  I'll do it on my dime.  That 4 million dollars is going here.  I don't understand why these guys don't have to sacrifice whatsoever.  And, you know, he's the figurehead of the whole fucking thing.  Why don't you make a statement?  It's crazy.  This motherfucker can't just go to Camp David or some shit.  He's got to always go to Hawaii, that fucking fictional land that he was born in.  Why can't he go to Camp David?  Yes, I'm a fucking birther.  That's a good point.  Why doesn't he just go to Camp David?  Why don't he go to the Hill and maybe try to hash something out with some of these guys?  Get a face-to-face meeting with some of the fucking people that he's saying aren't agreeing with him. 
[01:36:00]  Do what presidents do.  Sit down with the fucking people you're trying to convince of something and actually have a meeting.  This guy loved campaigning.  He loves traveling.  He doesn't like doing his fucking job.  Anthony, presidents and senators don't have men killed.  Now you're just being a homosexual, Jim.  Oh, subconscious.  Who's being naive now?  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:30]  Tennessee has no state income tax?  Whoa.  Yeah, there's a few states like that.  Texas.  Texas don't neither.  None.  Why?  I don't know.  They figure Florida doesn't have a state income tax.  EROC's home state of Florida doesn't have a state income tax.  I mean, not to fuck over those people, but why can't you start there?  New Hampshire.  And have a state tax for every state in the union?  Because.  Bounce it out a little bit.  Why is it if you live in New York City, you got federal, state, and city.  And city.  And then you got Tennessee and Texas not paying any state tax. 
[01:37:00]  I would really be horrified.  What the fuck is that about?  I would have sat down and added up every type of tax I have to actually spend.  It's well over half my money.  I mean, not even close.  It's well over half of what I fucking get goes to taxes.  With me going like, ah, well, I have no recourse.  I'm not doing it out of the kindness of my heart.  I'm doing it because if I don't, I go to jail.  What is that about? 
[01:37:30]  And they can make it whatever they want.  How does that happen?  Holy shit.  Did we fuck up years ago?  Letting them get their foot in the door with this fucking income tax shit.  FDR, right?  You used to be taxed on what you owned.  Not with what you made and shit.  Like they would assess things and tax you on the assessment of your possessions.  Now they tax you on what you fucking even bring in.  So then when you buy your possessions, that's taxed.  Then the shit you put on your property is taxed. 
[01:38:00]  The property is taxed, taxed, taxed.  Just to be fair.  And taxed.  For taxed.  Philip in Oklahoma is mad.  He says, Bush spent 58 days and one year on fucking vacation.  Shut up.  I'm not saying that Bush was the fucking be-all, end-all of non-vacationing presidents.  I think if you generalize, that would be a little better because every fucking president does all this shit.  They do.  I'm talking about the whole thing.  They should all go to Camp David.  Sorry that fucking Obama's president now.  And when I talk about the president and what he's doing, he's the guy now. 
[01:38:30]  Sorry.  Stop bringing up Bush.  We're in term two, motherfucker.  You know what's sad?  We have this tax discussion all the time.  It doesn't mean shit.  Nope.  It doesn't mean shit.  There's nothing we could do.  Imagine if we had it on video.  How much better that would be, though?  Oh, yeah.  You can see our angry faces.  But there's nothing we could do.  That's what's really frustrating.  No.  There's nothing we could do.  You are powerless.  What is he going to take where we don't take it anymore? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Some kind of, I think, some kind of grave economic disaster in the world that puts us at a horrible  place where people just have to say, no, I can't afford you anymore.  You fucking, I can't afford this country.  I think you'll see some states absolutely separate from the union.  Yeah.  Succeeding from the union, things like that.  They'll be seceding in our lifetime.  Yeah.  You'll see a couple.  Yeah, but there'll be some failures, too.  I do.  I was waiting for that. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  We got the councilwoman from Detroit.  Who is that bitch?  We're going to play what she said next for everybody.  We got Joe Piscopo coming in.  Oh, and other things, other things.  All right.  Serious XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  We got Joe Piscopo coming in today.  And we got some councilwoman in Detroit.  Yeah.  Needs Obama's help.  Obama bucks.  I want to hear this.  Yeah.  After the election of Jimmy Carter, the Honorable Coleman Alexander Young, he went to Washington,  D.C.  He came back home with some bacon. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  That's what you do.  That's what you do.  This is our people in an overwhelming way supported the re-election of this president.  And there ought to be a clear pro quo.  And you ought to exercise leadership on that.  Of course, not just that.  But why not?  So by votes is pretty much what she said.  We voted for him.  So now he's obligated to give us money.  That's that's wonderful. 
[01:41:00]  Or is she saying more that, like, you're not doing what you promised?  Well, yeah, that too.  But I mean, the whole fucking she represents people.  Yeah, I know.  I can't get past that.  I thought that was a Baptist church.  I can't get past that.  How is she representing people?  Bring home and come home with a little bacon.  Uh huh.  I like bacon.  I don't dig on swine.  Filthy animal.  That's what I want from my representative to go to Washington and bring home some bacon.  Bring home some bacon. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That isn't the be all end all of your fucking representative to just go to Washington and,  you know, fleece the people of more money to bring back to your constituency.  It's it's representing you, protecting your rights and and not just this money grab.  Ugh.  Fucking pigs.  I think it's worse in this country.  Or is it the media that makes it worse?  Worse than what? 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  I like the 70s, let's say.  I don't know.  It's different.  Early 80s.  It's different.  Is the country getting way worse?  I don't know.  Relatively speaking.  I don't know.  It's hard to look and get a perspective on it when you're in the moment.  You got to kind of put a few years and look back and go, wow, the fucking thousand teens.  We've always been bitching about taxes. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  We always think a lot of our representatives are a bunch of dummies.  Bunch of horse shite.  I mean, the two sides absolutely don't work together at all anymore.  There was a little more of that going on in the past, right?  Yeah.  I think the biggest thing that is ruining this country is the fact that we don't make anything.  We're not making anything.  I mean, yeah.  Except love to each other.  Yes, that's always nice.  I mean, we do have things like, you know, the iPhone and stuff, but that's made overseas. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  But the innovation, I don't know, those big items, we used to be giant.  Oh, sorry, guys.  That's the one you were just talking about.  Bring it home to bacon.  Yeah.  Bring it home to bacon.  That's good.  That's good.  Good luck with that.  Used to make those big money items, you know?  Car industry was huge.  And then you look at Detroit now, it's a fucking disaster area.  You know, what's the next big fucking thing?  It can't be forced, like this fucking alternative energy thing. 
[01:43:30]  Well, I have, I mean, I know what it's going to be, but nobody believes what I'm saying.  Oh, really?  It's hat television.  It's where you buy a baseball hat that is, it's like one of those screens on the side of  a building.  Uh-huh.  And you put it on your head, you just sit there and look in the mirror and watch hat television.  I like hat television.  I'm in.  Where can I invest?  You watch TV on your hat.  We should have had hat television and flying cars by now.  I don't know why you don't just take the hat off and watch it, but it doesn't work that 
[01:44:00]  way.  It's all backwards images.  Oh, okay.  That doesn't make sense.  You don't like hat television?  I hate it.  Hat television.  I think the biggest waste of time is the Republicans want to run this country and the Democrats  want to run this country, and they don't see it the other way whatsoever.  So they're hoping they could change the whole country to see it their way.  Working together has become counterproductive.  And they're just going to continue fucking fighting, fighting forever. 
[01:44:30]  Working together has become counterproductive because all you're doing when you compromise  with the other side is giving them a campaign platform.  Of course.  You're saying even, like a Republican will say, even, you know, six or seven or 15, whatever,  Democrats said this was a great idea.  It's like, really?  You're going to use it?  And that only makes people not want to work together because you don't want to give that 
[01:45:00]  guy the next leg up for the next election.  So it's a complete stalemate.  No one agrees on anything.  How much time do they waste with this shit, you think?  Most of their time down there, right?  Entire terms are wasted.  How many days do they actually work?  Boy, not that many.  In a way that's productive.  I don't know.  In a year.  Day-to-day, all they do is they're stalemate shit.  Probably a month. 
[01:45:30]  Probably one actual month of work out of every 12.  And the rest is just stalemate shit.  They're actually doing something.  Yeah.  And the rest is bullshit.  Yeah.  Not agreeing with each other.  Unbelievable.  It really is.  And no one sees any real fix for it.  You know?  Oh, what the hell are you doing?  Supposedly in California, when the new tax is going into effect, with the fiscal cliff  thing, tax rate will hit 52% for high-income Californians. 
[01:46:00]  There you go.  So officially, they'll be over 50%.  52%.  Unacceptable, man.  And California's broke.  There's no way you should pay that much and have a government that has no money.  And then a guy writes me more about Tennessee.  He writes, no state tax.  Here it is.  Scott Pruitt, it looks like.  Scott writes, Opie, Tennessee has no state income tax and has the best roads in the country, 
[01:46:30]  plus we have a balanced budget every year.  Well, good for Tennessee.  New York City's broke, and we got a city tax, state tax, federal tax, tax, tax, tax, and  we can't figure it out.  There's Tennessee.  It has less money coming in, and they figure it out.  What a burden we have to shoulder here in New York.  What a burden.  And this guy, another guy, he just writes, you should ask New York why they need so much  money when Tennessee can operate without a state income tax.  Yeah, exactly.  That's when you've got to be completely suspicious. 
[01:47:00]  They've got a lot more money coming in.  They can't figure shit out.  There's a crazy old broken down infrastructure here in New York City, and, you know, it's  New York City.  Security costs.  The police force is amazing.  Wait, why are we talking about this again?  I don't know.  Nothing changes.  I know.  Let's talk about something more fun.  Nothing does change.  What are we doing?  It's crazy.  Rex Ryan chose Mark Sanchez to be the quarterback Sunday. 
[01:47:30]  He's a fucking...  I think this is a national story at this point.  I know you have your favorite fucking football team, but you've got to be looking at this  Jets situation and laughing.  Why is he doing that?  Holy fuck.  There's a new theory that he's trying to get fired, because he probably has a really  good deal on the table to go somewhere else, and he's had it with this organization.  That's the new theory.  So he's on purpose going to fuck things up?  A lot of people that know way more about sports than me, they're saying, they're hinting  that he might be doing this on purpose now. 
[01:48:00]  Because it defies all logic.  The guy's a jerk-off.  It defies all logic.  And a lot of people, their argument was, do you really think Tebow's a better quarterback  than Sanchez?  At this point, yeah, I think so.  At this point, anyone would be right.  I think so.  And now, next game that he's in, is that Sunday?  Yeah.  Against Jacksonville.  The first one he coughs up.  Oh my God.  Of course. 
[01:48:30]  Oh my God.  But we said that last week.  Yeah.  He had three picks.  We said that last week.  And McIlroy, who came in and did, you know, he did a decent job.  He did exactly what Sanchez hasn't been able to do.  He marched down the field and got the Jets a touchdown.  Did he march?  He looked silly.  March, march, march.  Looked silly.  He's going to be the third string for the game.  Oh, really?  So he went Sanchez, Tebow back up, and then McIlroy will be back where he is, just kind  of warming his hiney during the game.  Yeah, he's just being a stubborn cunt, Rex. 
[01:49:00]  He's lost so many fucking supporters.  Well, then why doesn't the GM step in and fire him and do something?  Well, some shit will go down in the offseason.  But I mean, why not now?  I'm sure.  Why don't they show their fans that they're attempting to improve now?  This is why I hate the Jets organization.  And the fans, by the way, if you guys are really tired of it, stop going to the...  This is how your fucking team is treating you.  Oh, they don't stop going.  He is so stubborn.  And he said, look, he said something that a lot of people agree with, that Sanchez has 
[01:49:30]  all the skills, knows how to make all the right passes.  But he can't hold on to the fucking ball.  He turns it over way too much.  So he's convinced.  Oh, I mean, it doesn't hurt that Sanchez makes 8.2 million a year, too.  So you can't...  It's almost like, look, we're paying him that much fucking money.  You make sure he fucking starts.  He's a bum.  That's the...  I think Sanchez is a bum.  He's a bum.  The A-Rod syndrome.  Yep.  And so is Rex Ryan.  He's making so much money that...  But A-Rod gives the appearance that he doesn't give a fuck.  Sanchez absolutely gives a fuck.  And A-Rod's great in the regular season. 
[01:50:00]  In the regular season, A-Rod earns a lot of his money.  Because he is almost an MVP quality player.  It's just in the playoffs that he sucks a fucking pile of dick.  Sanchez absolutely shows he gives a fuck.  He cares.  But he can't hold on to the fucking ball.  No, huh?  And at this point, the Jets really don't have much to lose.  I mean, if they win their remaining games, I think they got a sure shot at the playoffs.  But they still have to win them all.  Win every game.  We got four left, I think.  They got to win all four, I think.  At least three out of four, minimum. 
[01:50:30]  I don't think that'll happen.  But there it is.  I made the decision to go with Mark Sanchez.  I wonder if it's because he benched him and he wants to see how that affects his performance.  Like, will that benching spark him to play better?  Maybe he needs to see it.  The point is, he's not going to win a Super Bowl for the Jets.  No.  So the Jets got to figure something out in the offseason.  I don't even know if they can figure it out with his contract and stuff.  He stinks.  How many games have they won? 
[01:51:00]  What are we up to?  What the fuck is our record?  Not five and seven, right?  Like four and eight.  I could actually throw that amount of interceptions in the first few minutes.  I could do that.  You could do that?  Five and seven?  We're five and seven?  It says here.  Okay.  Yeah, five and seven.  All right.  Lost track somewhere.  So he's not throwing this.  He's saying he's not ready to give up on the season yet, basically.  He sees Sanchez as his quarterback and he doesn't want to.  Well, he'll go down with Sanchez.  That's fine, I guess. 
[01:51:30]  Good for him.  But I don't know.  It's all stupid.  Oh, but Tennessee has a high sales tax?  But it seems to work for that state.  What's the percentage?  That's what Canada does, too.  Let me find out.  Let me find out.  Sales tax.  Chuck in North Carolina pays.  I like that.  Yes.  Everyone.  Chuck?  Yeah, man.  I just wanted to let you know, Tennessee doesn't have a sales tax, I mean an income tax, state tax,  but they have a high sales tax. 
[01:52:00]  So that means all the people that ain't working and all that shit in the Mexicans, they're still paying taxes because of the highest sales tax.  Right.  What's the percentage?  I'm thinking it's about nine or ten.  Okay.  Ten percent.  Like nine or ten cents on a dollar.  But they do have good roads.  And Anthony, if you ever want to come to North Carolina and take a vacation, I'll teach you how to drive my drive car.  You still like fast cars, don't you?  Who wants to drive a car in a dress? 
[01:52:30]  Sounds like a pisser.  But also...  Driving a big truck.  See you.  Thank you, buddy.  They have better roads in Tennessee, but they also have a lot less cars and a lot less people.  It's easier to keep those roads.  Was there nine people that live there?  I think ten or eleven.  Oh, yeah.  It's doubled.  Yeah.  That's a ten percent sales tax.  Yeah.  I would deal with that for no state tax.  That's pretty good.  What they do to us is just sickening.  It's terrible.  Everyone pays.  We brought up the fact that you make money.  They already taxed you on the money. 
[01:53:00]  And then you try to do something with the money that you have left and they tax that.  I think it's infuriating.  I think it's infuriating.  So angering.  Who is...  Oh, shit.  I've been losing my thoughts a lot.  Oh, where do they go?  I don't know.  To my hiney.  I've been on Alzheimer's.  Oh, no.  You're learning a script.  Oh, but no, I'm not.  You have...  Oh, what?  Oh, no.  See, I'm losing my memory.  I forget who's here.  I'm Anthony.  Yeah, I'm trying to do a script. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  I did one yesterday.  I did an audition.  You did?  How did you think you did?  It was okay.  I mean, I'm sure I won't get a call for it.  Why would I?  Were you in front of somebody famous doing it or...  No.  No?  No, no.  Just a casting director.  Oh.  Did you get on the casting couch and suck his cock?  I tried.  But he turned me down and it was a she.  Sexual favors.  Yeah, but I'm sure I won't get it.  Another thing.  Yeah.  I was watching the new season of Jesse Ventura, Conspiracy Theory. 
[01:54:00]  He got another season.  I don't know where.  I thought the show was totally dead and canceled.  Oh, he's good, though.  And then there's some new fucking shows.  He has integrity.  Integrity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's his new conspiracies?  Do we have a list of the ones he's going to tackle?  These new ones, by the way, make last season look like the best of Walter Cronkite as far as that.  This new season is so ridiculous, I'm almost seeing it as a joke.  We got preview clips? 
[01:54:30]  The one I saw was...  He would not be in on the joke, by the way.  ...lizard people.  Lizard people?  Yes, that there are people in high, powerful places in the world that are actually alien lizards.  Well, Louis C.K.  Donald Rumsfeld.  There you go.  Yes, Donald Rumsfeld.  They did bring it up.  And they have actual video, slowed down video, of Barack Obama and George Bush and whatnot talking and giving a speech.  And then for like a single frame, their eyes are green and have lines in them. 
[01:55:00]  Green with envy.  Well, no.  Green with lizard.  This is the guy people get mad at for me yelling at.  Right.  All you 9-11 conspiracy jerk-offs, this is your fucking...  This is the guy leading the pack.  That's the guy.  You dummies.  What if he's just fucking with everybody?  I think he is.  I honestly think he is.  Nah, he got so mad and walked out.  No, that's really him.  He did one on...  I watched the other one on... 
[01:55:30]  Is this the lizard people one?  Time travel.  Hold on, let's look at the preview clip for lizard people.  Here's reptilian takeover.  Okay.  Let's hear some of it.  Reptilians masquerading as world leaders.  Yeah, yeah.  Plotting to enslave, maybe kill off the human population.  Jesse Ventura is closing in on a conspiracy that's too urgent to ignore.  This is bizarre stuff, to say the least.  Talking about reptilians.  The reptilian itself is so far-fetched to me. 
[01:56:00]  This is like the biggest fantasy you could write about.  And yet you're here with a straight face telling me it's real.  I'm telling you that it's real.  These reptilian people in positions of power are literally coming from another dimension.  Jesse doesn't buy it.  But he's thrown for a loop.  When an alternative historian claims that U.S. presidents come from a reptilian bloodline.  Barack Obama, George Bush, Bill Clinton, they all come from this one bloodline? 
[01:56:30]  That is absolutely true.  That's coming from Burke's Peerage, which is the premier genealogical research firm in the world.  Burke's Peerage is the definitive guide to royal family trees.  You can't watch this seriously.  It's research shows that nearly every U.S. president has ties to British and French royal families.  You can call them reptilians.  Sure, some are connected through distant cousins.  But what does it matter if our leaders are actually reptilians? 
[01:57:00]  In the big picture, we're hearing about global government today.  And obviously, if all our hierarchy are reptilian, wouldn't this then be a global reptilian takeover of the Earth?  Is that accurate?  It is accurate.  And there is a new world order forming.  And we know that people from this bloodline are the ones in positions of power.  So it only makes sense that if there's going to be a global government in the future, it will be ruled by... 
[01:57:30]  Don't be lizard people.  Thank you for your service.  You know who should be worried?  Flies.  Meanwhile, video debunker Jose Escamilla shows Tyrell more internet clips.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  Ones that spread the theory that world leaders are reptilians in disguise.  Yeah.  This is Obama.  Watch.  Like this video of President Barack Obama.  Look, he's doing it, giving a speech.  They slow it down.  Watch what happens.  You can see scales on his face.  Scales on his face. 
[01:58:00]  A shift to lizard-like eyes.  And look.  Oh, okay.  What the hell?  Oh, that wasn't the animal I would have thought.  George W. with a lizard tongue.  I mean...  Yeah.  Oh, because George...  Anyone can kind of do that.  Because George W. Bush is licking his lips.  He's doing a lizard tongue thing.  Oh, my God.  He should be embarrassed.  He should be.  Jesse Ventura is an embarrassment.  You know what?  Do that show, but be like Penn Jillette with bullshit.  He's...  He's taking the serious angle.  He's almost...  No, he's almost drifting.  I gotta be honest.  I would love to be able to say he's believing everything and treating it seriously. 
[01:58:30]  But, no, he is really kind of taking that angle on a few of these things.  He also has his son on his team.  That he's debunking it.  He's like, this is total horse shit.  All right.  His son works with him now on his team.  On the team.  And Oliver Stone's son, who just walks around and mugs for the camera like Zoolander because he's just a handsome guy.  So, they give him, like, these scenarios where he's got to talk to this expert about time travel. 
[01:59:00]  And he squints his eyes, purses his lips, puts his thumb in his belt loop, shakes his head a lot.  Oliver Stone's son?  Yeah, yeah.  Is he good?  That's him?  He's just one of these handsome guys that just has no...  Like, no take on this whole thing.  He's just...  He's just there for eye candy for the girls.  Because he never had to work.  That's why I'm here.  No.  He's never had to work a day in his life.  It's hilarious.  He should be making films like his dad or something.  Yeah, he does Blue Steel. 
[01:59:30]  What is that?  Lucky Steel.  Oh, duh.  From Zoolander.  Sorry.  Magnum.  What other things are they doing with the show?  Time travel.  The government has been sending people back in time to change history.  Generals were sent back to George Washington's time to give him pointers.  And then this guy, this whole episode hinged on this one guy. 
[02:00:00]  Can I ask a question?  Yes, sir.  Did Washington take the pointers?  Or did he say, I'd rather talk later.  My wooden teeth hurt.  Could you get back in your space machine and bring me plastic teeth, please?  Why would you make teeth out of wood?  Imagine the splintering that happens.  He, uh, yes, Washington did take the advice of the people that were sent back.  There were, um, these, these...  But how is time travel supposed to work?  Well, based on...  How are you supposed to go back in time?  Based on the episode, there were so many different variations of this time travel. 
[02:00:30]  But how are you supposed to go back in time?  It's got something to do with traveling at the speed of light or close to the speed of light.  So then what happens?  You could see George Washington living?  Yes.  That sounds stupid.  Yes, you would, you, there's, uh, uh, particle accelerators and they, they spin, um, particles  faster than the speed of light, which then opens up a tunnel, which you can then, uh, go  through and end up, um, in various times through history.  Well, here's what happened. 
[02:01:00]  There was a picture, a photograph that they were teasing this whole episode of a guy, and  they never showed the picture until the end of this guy pointing at the picture going,  this is me at the Gettysburg Address.  This is me.  And, and they're like, well, that's you.  And the son is like, oh, that's you.  But meanwhile, it, it's the blurriest nothing picture of him as a child because they sent  back school children back in time to deliver something.  Yeah.  How marvelous to the first uncle Paul back in 1790. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, sure.  Uncle Stanfish.  Stanfish.  Hey, Uncle Stanfish.  What's that stuff dripping on my pilgrim shoes?  Hey.  Miles Standish?  No, it's Stanfish.  Hi, I'm a little injured boy.  How are you?  Oh, no.  Come here.  You got some anthrax in your underpants.  More atrocities for the, for the red skin. 
[02:02:00]  Let me slide down your underpants and get the anthrax out of there.  It fell in the crap.  I'm traveling, Paul.  How would it not be good?  Hey, look it.  Close your eyes.  He's like, I got a peace pipe for you.  Oh, boy.  Kiss the spitting peace pipe.  Oh, Jesus.  Yay.  Yay.  Have the spitting peace pipe.  Give you a little peace in your backside.  Yay.  Oh, that's terrible.  Shouldn't send Uncle Paul back through time to molest children.  Yeah.  Put the pilgrim hat over your face so you can't see nothing. 
[02:02:30]  Look at my big pilgrim socks.  Yay.  This, um, this gentleman, this gentleman wreaks havoc on the voice, huh?  Yeah.  This gentleman said he went back in time as a child.  They had a, they had a bunch of school age children.  You watched time travel.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  That were time travelers.  And, uh, one of them was this guy who went back to the Gettysburg address and he goes,  you could notice in my picture here, I'm wearing shoes that are much too big.  Which, I don't know what that was supposed to mean. 
[02:03:00]  You know what it was?  His shoes got blood on him, so I gave him mine to wear for the picture.  Bloody shoes.  File trading was so hard back then because there was no electricity.  I'd say, hey, let's trade some pictures.  I'll meet ye by the pub.  Meet ye.  And we would show up with drawings.  That's wonderful.  Look, this is Timothy without his underpants.  I drew this on a piece of paper.  Show me ye pictures. 
[02:03:30]  They, um...  Let's have some warm ale so we can breathe it into the boy's face.  They, um, got, uh, this picture.  And the guy apparently has these giant shoes.  Big, big shoes on.  And then he's holding a cylinder, he said.  Which just looked like his shirt.  No, that wasn't his shirt.  It was a cylinder.  A fleshy cylinder.  Holding it in his mouth. 
[02:04:00]  He brought a fleshlight back.  With him.  Wonderful.  Darkest state secret.  Oh.  Oh, yeah?  That the United States possesses.  What's that?  Yeah.  That's one way to grab someone's attention.  This is a technology that allows a person to go from point A, B, C, D in time to another  point E, F, Y, G.  Why so many points?  That's what you're talking about.  Wait a minute now.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:04:30]  Time out of me.  Wait.  Oh, don't worry.  You're talking to me here like H.G. Wells in the time machine.  The time machine.  You're saying to me that the U.S. government is involved in time travel or a time machine.  Yeah, okay.  That's right.  But the Jesse from two years ago would be all ready to do time travel.  Like he ran out of fucking ideas.  The problem is, number one, that it's very dangerous.  And they've hurt a lot of people doing it.  Oh, boy.  And that needs to be exposed.  They've hurt a lot of people. 
[02:05:00]  All right, where are these people?  So Weber says the government's been working with time travel for decades.  That thousands of people have been killed along the way.  And they used them in the experiments, knowing that a lot of them were going to be killed.  They can mind control you.  They can capture you.  And they can send you.  And you've just disappeared.  Dumb.  Well, let me ask you this, Alfred.  Why would they kill to keep this secret?  Yeah.  Because dead men tell no tales. 
[02:05:30]  Make that up.  What's the tale to be told?  Right now, the agencies that have control of this technology are two agencies.  DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  And the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  Can they use this technology to make a weapon?  Oh, of course.  And time travel has been weaponized from day one.  Oh, man.  And it's been used against the United States of America.  Sure it has.  How?  Give me an example. 
[02:06:00]  This is an example that is near and dear to your heart.  I know, Governor.  Governor.  They had photographs of the planes hitting the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.  They had those photographs in 1971.  Whoa.  Now, listen to this.  That would be astounding.  Oh, and you know what he says?  He goes, and in 71, there was somebody working on this time travel project that during 9-11 and later in 2001 was the Secretary of Defense. 
[02:06:30]  You know what?  Donald Rumsfeld.  I actually believe that because there's a call on the first flight.  Yeah.  Remember the flight attendant was calling air traffic control about the hijackers, and at one moment she's panicking, and she says,  Could you sit down, Mr. Clemente?  Sorry.  I see it was Roberto Clemente on the plane. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, see?  I was wondering what that was.  Now this makes perfect sense.  I heard another phone call, though, a recording from another phone call, and it said,  Hello, baby.  Where are these pictures?  Well, the pictures, I don't know, but I do remember on that call when somebody said,  I know we're being killed, but can I just have one quick autograph, Mr. Croce?  I said, aha.  Aha.  So the guy just says there were pictures from the 70s. 
[02:07:30]  So where are the pictures?  Where are the pictures?  Well, wouldn't you just show the pictures?  He had 9-11 pictures back in the 70s seeing those planes.  All right, fine.  Where are the pictures?  Crashing into, what?  Where are the pictures?  He said they exist.  Oh, you and your details.  Stop it.  People are bringing up the videos of cell phones in old movies.  Time travel.  Did we do that video?  Videos of cell phones in old movies.  There's a famous one where it was a premiere for, I don't know, a silent film, I believe. 
[02:08:00]  It might have been Charlie Chaplin.  And supposedly a guy walks through it with a cell phone.  A cell phone in a Charlie Chaplin movie.  And it's creeped out people.  That's crazy.  Is this the video?  It might be.  All right.  We're looking at, it's a silent movie, I guess.  I wouldn't know.  I can't see it.  There's someone walking through it.  Sam's having fun watching it.  Oh, is that somebody talking on a cell phone right there?  Yeah, yeah.  Whoa, what the fuck?  Oh, you've never seen this before?  Whoa, why is that person talking on a cell phone? 
[02:08:30]  Could you get the one where they talk about it?  Wait, let me see.  That is pretty fucking funny.  Isn't that wild?  You know why?  Because you look at it going, oh, so what?  It's just somebody talking on a cell phone.  But then it's like, no, wait a minute, that's a silent movie.  Oh, no, this is absolutely real video from back in the day.  And it looks like an old lady or an old man.  Oh, my God.  Is walking through and has a cell phone up to their left ear.  Here comes somebody.  You've never seen this before? 
[02:09:00]  With a cell phone up to their head.  Come on, that's stupid.  Charlie Chaplin's time travel.  Oh, my God.  Maybe it's something to report Jews with.  It's some kind of Jew reporting device.  Yeah, you announce it and you push it back.  Mankind has always been fascinated by the thought of traveling in time.  Report the Jews.  Over the centuries, there have been all kinds of ideas about how it could be done.  Yes.  But, of course, time travel is impossible.  Shut up.  Ah! 
[02:09:30]  I love that.  This is the story of Håkan Nordqvist, a man who claims to have visited the future.  I've been working in Ireland.  And I came home and I came in to the church.  Wait, wait.  Why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't they?  Get the Charlie Chaplin one.  There's another video where they explain and they talk about it.  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  So, um, what could that person...  Is time travel possible? 
[02:10:00]  According to a YouTube video posted by George Clark, not only is it possible, he says he's  got proof.  You've got to see this.  Watch with me.  This is a movie clip from 1928.  This is a movie premiere for Charlie Chapman's The Circus.  And you see the woman walking in the background with her hand to her ear.  We're trying to zoom in so you can see it here.  Mark David Chaplin.  Oh, I can't see, Sam.  You pull the X out.  He's got the CNN sign in front.  Oh, my God.  Sam, you're fired.  Can you believe...  You have to take that thing, exit out.  This?  Yes.  It's right in the way of what we're watching. 
[02:10:30]  I don't think...  But wait.  Oh, my God.  They actually...  Oh, my God.  Fucking God.  Look at CNN and what sloppy dog shit TV they put on.  It interferes with what they're showing.  They put so much shit on their screens.  You've got to see this newsroom.  And it's newsroom CNN over the part you need to see.  What fucking terrible TV fucking producing place.  You can see it here.  No, you can't.  This woman talking on a cell phone. 
[02:11:00]  But wait.  Wow, is that bad?  Cell phones didn't exist 82 years ago.  Look.  So you see the dilemma.  See her hand up to her ear.  She's talking.  Who's she talking to?  How fucked up is that?  We don't know.  Others saying, no, that's not a cell phone.  You know, she's holding a hearing device.  Others are saying she traveled back in time.  Look at this fucking CNN thing in the way.  They freeze it.  And it's causing quite a stir on the net.  Hearing device, cell phone.  Terrible.  Hearing device, cell phone.  That was so badly done because of their dumb fuck graphics in the way. 
[02:11:30]  Just lazy fucking self-promotion.  A lot of people have debunked it and said, you know, back then they had the hearing aid things  where you kind of almost had to hold them.  You know what I mean?  Why was she holding it?  Who would she be talking to?  Well, that's the old...  There's no service.  I'm going to just...  Yeah, right.  Sam's right.  There's no cell service.  That's right.  Have as many phones as you want.  So she could be...  She was actually on AT&T now in New York. 
[02:12:00]  You're right.  Why would she...  Maybe they went back in time travel and set up some cell towers.  Maybe right before they set up a tower.  Why does she have to be the only one that traveled back in time?  To set up a tower and then they gave a couple people phones and then she's calling the other  person.  There's a longer video of this where they really get into it.  I don't...  I thought we did this on our show already.  A while ago.  Do you see any other...  No?  Because they try to explain like the theories and shit. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, there it is.  You see that weird guy, the second one down?  That was the video I saw.  That guy?  And that's the one with the 6.5 million views.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's see what this fucking jack-off is saying.  He's the one that found it.  Ow.  Oh, he's the one that found this.  Oh, he is?  Hi there.  My name's George Clark.  Hey, George.  From Belfast.  From Belfast.  Creators of the award-winning Battle of the Bone, The Knackery, and quite a few other 
[02:13:00]  productions that you're bound to hear of in the next couple of years.  I wanted to make this video because I believe I'm the first person to find something quite  unusual.  Two years ago.  A bit of footage from 1928 in the Charlie Chaplin film The Circus.  I've screened this to about 100 people at the film festival that I run.  That is two turning to two.  And nobody can give me an explanation for what you're about to see. 
[02:13:30]  I've watched this footage myself for probably well over a year now.  Now?  I bought it.  Nice.  Whenever I bought the whole box set.  Oh.  Being a big Charlie Chaplin fan.  Right.  It was a bargain.  It was like...  Who gives a shit?  Oh, my God.  I bought all of his classics.  All of his top movies.  This guy doing a show in Atlantic City.  I tend to watch a lot of the extras and a lot of the making of us and things like that.  Obviously, my hero is Jackie Chan, as you can see. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  And his hero, along with my other, is Charlie Chaplin.  All right.  Right.  And at one point, when I was watching the behind-the-scenes footage of the circus, and  I went to the Hollywood premiere at Man's Chinese Theatre in 1928, and a certain scene happened  just in the opening of it where I was kind of stumped at what I saw, and I kept winding  it back, playing it, winding it back, playing it, and I couldn't explain this. 
[02:14:30]  So, what I'm about to show you has been screened, personally, to over 100 people.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  How'd you get through this guy?  What a horrible bore.  He could have started the video right here.  Yeah.  Look what I found.  Upon giving me an explanation as to what it is.  All right.  We get it.  And I pretty much want to get this out there, to let people try and give me an idea, because...  Stop talking about yourself.  How many minutes in is he already?  Which sounds absolutely ridiculous.  This guy sucks.  I hope he died right after this.  But it's time-traveling. 
[02:15:00]  It's 25 minutes, man.  Yeah.  When you're looking at a bit of footage from 1928 with an old woman, and even that will  contradict, because it looks like a man in drag on a mobile phone.  Suddenly instant.  Mobile phone?  It's kind of strange.  You just can't explain it.  Then show it!  So, play the footage here and let you decide for yourself.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  I turn it off.  I'm done.  Oh, it's this thing.  We saw this.  That's true.  There's the man in drag. 
[02:15:30]  How fucked up is he?  And E-Rock is also in this.  It's an elephant.  I'm sorry, Eric.  You're not an elephant.  I'm sorry, Eric.  All right.  There's a...  Well, it's nice to see it without the fucking CNN logo.  Oh, God.  Are they terrible?  A man walks by, and then this fat thing comes by with a cell phone.  And then turns slightly toward the camera.  It looked like a talking, but...  Yeah, it looks like talking and holding something to the ear. 
[02:16:00]  But who would this person be talking to?  Yeah.  She or he is not...  Valid point there.  No, but who is she talking to?  There's no one around her.  If it was a hearing aid, and she was just trying to talk to someone.  You know what I mean?  That's fucked up.  That is weird.  The mannerisms are definitely the same as somebody who would be talking on a phone.  Right.  You sure that wasn't just put in?  Is that really from the movie, or is that put in?  Oh, no.  It's really from the movie. 
[02:16:30]  That has been proven.  Okay.  That has been proven.  That's somebody fucking on a cell phone.  Did we lose his audio?  No, he's going to come back.  It's a long video.  But don't you assume that if the person, let's say...  So as you can see, the guy walks on past.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, bless you.  And the lady follows him, big butch lady.  And if you look carefully, she's talking on a thin black device that is held to her ear.  Oh, no.  Oh.  If you notice also that the knuckles are bent in the flat shape of the phone. 
[02:17:00]  That's how you would hold a phone.  So fucked up.  There's no phone there.  The flat shape of a phone.  The phone is to her ear.  It is not an ear trumpet.  It is not an AM FM radio, because obviously it's 1928.  Ass trumpet.  It was...  She's just fixing her hair or something, or she's scratching, and she's probably talking,  because back then, the sounds on the set didn't matter. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, no.  It was a premiere.  That wasn't an actual clip from the movie.  Yeah, it's just the premiere of the movie.  That was the premiere of the movie, just watching some random people.  Yeah, that's like real life.  Oh.  Yes.  That's just real life.  And he just said it's obviously not an AM FM radio, because it's 1928.  Must be a cell phone.  Right.  That's really...  That makes perfect sense.  Must be a cell phone.  Yeah.  Why can't it be an AM FM radio?  It's equally as part of his time traveled.  Yeah.  Why wasn't it just some crazy lady touching her face and talking to herself, kind of like 
[02:18:00]  them...  The other day, there's a guy who yelled at someone and then threw him in front of a train, and  we're like, oh my God, that woman's lips couldn't be moving for no reason.  It was a time traveler.  She's a crazy old bitch.  But you saw, like, something in her hand.  No, you didn't.  You used to watch her hand.  It looks at the end.  It looks like she's scratching.  Really?  You show the very end again.  He ignores the twist at the end that makes it not look like your cell phone at all.  Really?  Of course he does.  Yeah.  It's really right at the last...  And I caught it.  The eagle eye, the eagle eye McGillicuddy's my nickname.  Watch the twist. 
[02:18:30]  Not the air...  Oh, see.  It fades out.  Okay.  So as you can see, the guy walks on past...  Watch the twist where it doesn't look like your cell phone anymore.  Big butch lady.  And if you look carefully, she's talking.  That little twitched down.  Yeah, the twitched down.  Thin black device that is held to your ear.  I don't see it.  It's supposed to be a thick black device in your mouth.  That the knuckles are bent.  Cock it.  In the flat shape.  I get my phone.  He's explaining how we use our cell phones.  We get it.  You see that twist at the end?  In the flat shape of a phone.  Okay, that makes sense.  He's demonstrating the phone holding. 
[02:19:00]  It's not an ear trumpet.  It is not an AM, FM radio.  Because obviously it's 93.  That's what I call farts.  Ear trumpets.  Technically, there's nothing I can explain that could be what is in her hand.  If you look carefully...  I know what else is in your hand.  A gun.  You know, zoom it up here.  There's just...  There's just nothing.  I mean, it's clear that she's talking.  Right, shut up.  She's talking into a device.  Probably a seashell, this fucking nut. 
[02:19:30]  And she turns around and she kind of looks at the camera.  And that's the weirdest part for me, I think.  Okay, it's weird enough that she's talking on a device.  There's no wires.  There's no long antenna coming out.  Oh my God.  It's pretty much an old lady.  Well...  I hate this guy.  With the device to her ear, talking into it...  Well, then it's gotta be.  Yeah, it couldn't be a crazy person.  Oh.  She's mouth in the way, but more in shock.  It's gotta be time travel.  That's more believable than a crazy person.  Wouldn't the time traveler know that he found out, have seen this, and not have gone in front 
[02:20:00]  of the camera, so it would have never have happened in the first place, for him to never  make the video, for that person to see, so they knew not to go back in time, to not  do it, so he couldn't see it again.  If they had done that, then Biff would have ended up taking over Hill Valley.  In an alternate timeline.  Right.  Yeah.  We're not talking about a circular timeline.  Right. 
[02:20:30]  We're talking a branch timeline of Back to the Future.  I gotta piss.  Yeah, this guy's still talking about it.  He loves himself.  Hey, it's Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  Let's take a break.  Oh, Joe Piscopo's blowing his nose.  Oh my God.  In an old man way, too.  Joe Piscopo.  We're gonna take a break.  We're gonna talk to Joe Piscopo next.  We'll put this dumb video up on our Facebook page for you, if you haven't checked it out  yet.  Opie and Anthony on the Facebook. 
[02:21:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Why are we doing this?  Jersey for Joe Piscopo.  No, I know why we're doing the song.  I'm just saying, why are we doing this?  We haven't seen him in a while.  Joe Piscopo's about to enter our studio. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, why not?  We met him at N.E.W. about 10 years ago.  Come on in, yeah.  Longer, actually.  Probably 12 years ago.  There he is.  The great Joe Piscopo has entered the studio.  Joe Piscopo.  Oh my God.  How you doing, sir?  Pleasure to see you again.  You too.  It's been a while.  What's up, Joe?  Joe Piscopo.  How are you, sir?  Let's touch.  I look all right?  I just want to see you guys.  Oh, come on.  Take a seat.  Let's have some fun.  Hey, Joe.  It's so funny.  You guys.  Joe Piscopo. 
[02:22:00]  We're great, right?  Oh, you.  You.  You.  You.  Uh-oh.  You're wearing a New York thing.  I'm like a wuss over here, you know?  You're wearing a New York thing.  That's not good.  It was nice.  The other day, I saw you tweeted that you were getting a Christmas tree.  You know what?  I did.  It was all nice out.  You know what?  We went to the boondocks out there in Warren County where men are men and sheep are nervous.  You want a tree?  You got to squeal like a pig.  You guys said, okay, that's great.  That's okay.  So they give you the saw.  They give you the saw like the Jason saw, you know? 
[02:22:30]  Sure, sure.  You got to cut it yourself.  Oh, you got to cut it yourself.  I got to do it with my kids.  So they said, I got to look like a guy, you know?  Because I'm getting old.  Like a real man, right.  You know, like a man.  So I went there, sawed it down, and we carried it.  I freaking carried it from up in the hill all the way down.  So it was very, very nice.  Wow.  And I set it up already.  I got to do it, man.  Oh, you did it?  Nice one.  I'm picking the tree.  I got it, huh?  How big?  And again, you can tell I'm getting older with the kids.  I got to wait until it's like 60 degrees out, you know? 
[02:23:00]  Right, right, right.  And we went out, so it was real nice and everything, you know?  It was nice, yeah, yeah.  Hey, you guys, I got to tell you something.  First, I got to...  No, no, no, no.  Oh, boy.  How long have we...  We've known each other, like 20 years?  Like 20 years old?  It's been a while back at...  I would say NW.  Where was the first one where I walked in and a new girl was there?  Remember that?  Because I'm like...  I love you, man.  I'm so straight.  I'm like, I'm a dinosaur.  Are we not answering any of these questions?  No, do you remember that?  No, where was it?  It was NW.  It was NW.  W, NW.  And there was a naked girl in the studio?  There was like a...  We used to do that.  And they said, Joe, and I didn't look because I'm like a, you know, I'm like Mr. Straight 
[02:23:30]  Mitts.  I go, I know.  In hindsight, you should have looked.  Right?  I should have married her for God's sake.  That's what I should have done.  Exactly.  I'll tell you, I'm all right now, but this week I was in rough shape.  How are you?  I'll tell you.  So, you know what?  What's that?  It's good to see you guys.  So, so many people...  What do you mean you were in rough shape?  No, no, no.  It was really good.  It was just like...  You know what?  It was...  You know why it was in rough shape?  I thought it was in rough shape.  No, it's because of the women.  With the women.  I want to talk...  No shit.  You know?  Oh, come on.  I saw...  The bitches out of the bitches.  Joe, I can totally sympathize with you. 
[02:24:00]  I went through that crap.  I don't know what you can say or can't say.  I understand that part of it, too.  I could say whatever I want, and I know what the deal is.  Why?  Why?  There shouldn't be...  I'm seeing numbers that are astounding to me, what you have to...  What you're responsible for.  Thank you.  For what?  Did she ever get up there and tell a goddamn joke?  No!  Wait, what?  No!  The number might be 15 G's a month.  Oh, my God.  More like 16, because they get a cost of living increase.  What else?  So, you know what? 
[02:24:30]  I got...  And I'm glad I'm on the show.  And first of all, I want to thank all...  Wait, do you have kids together, Joe?  Do you have kids?  Yeah.  Oh, new jerseys.  You know what?  That's like Anthony said, man.  It's like, man, once you have kids, they hold the children hostage.  Yes.  The state, and they hold the...  And I have to tell you, and I want to thank everybody, first of all, for the...  I have so many warm and wonderful greetings from you guys.  A lot of love from our fans, huh?  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  They're warm.  No!  Can you believe that?  That's great.  I'll tell you.  And everybody...  So, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I have to...  Let me just do a caveat.  Then we got to talk about this, because I got nailed last week, and then I said, let me go 
[02:25:00]  on O&A, and let's talk about this.  Sure.  What am I going to freaking do?  Talk about it, you know, put me in an orange jumpsuit in a county jail.  I don't care, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm ready to go.  I've had it.  I've had it.  No, you know, a little bit.  What happened last week?  You reached a point where you've had it.  Yeah.  I understand.  But why?  Why?  All we do is give out, give out.  You know?  It's like, come on.  You got to give me a break a little bit.  Why?  Listen, my own fault.  It's my own fault.  Oh, boy.  When you run off with the young broad...  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, Joe.  When you run off with a babysitter, it's going to come back to bite you in the butt. 
[02:25:30]  And you know that.  You know, Joe.  And you wrote that song.  You wrote the song.  Listen, this is the bit.  This is the bit.  Because Howard's a big star and he doesn't show up for work.  Sure, sure.  So I have a big...  God forbid he shows up.  Oh, Jesus.  Howard.  Monday to Wednesday.  He's like Johnny Carson.  You know what I'm saying?  And God bless him.  He built the network and he deserves it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We love Howard.  You and I...  Listen, I can't do it because I'll see it in court.  But you could write the new Kimberly.  Oh, man.  You want us to write the song?  I have the opening line.  Go ahead. 
[02:26:00]  Kimberly.  I hate to be blunt.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Don't, no, no.  Don't, no, no.  You and I told us to write the song.  Don't stop.  How's that this?  All right, wait.  Let Jimmy give it another song.  I'll change the line.  There's plenty of work.  Jimmy's going to try it again.  Oh, Jesus.  So I'm going to be in trouble, though.  Not guilty.  Not guilty, Your Honor.  Your Honor, I had nothing to do with it.  You're just here.  It's a radio show, Your Honor.  Guilt by association.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Think about it.  But I want... 
[02:26:30]  No, but I got it.  Something about Kimberly.  No, no, no, no.  Something...  Hey.  Something sucking trigger.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Okay, no, no.  That's...  That's crazy.  You have to say in the opening line.  You told us to write the new song, Joe.  Oh, something about...  And I got to say...  Let me say right off the bat, if I may.  Is that...  No, everybody...  It's not right off the bat anymore.  I get so many...  So many people...  There was one kid, Roby.  I got to tell you.  It was Jonathan.  And he hit me on Twitter or something like that.  And he was so cute.  He goes, you know, this is... 
[02:27:00]  I'm a loyal ONA fan, man.  But they hang you out to dry, man.  Oh, no.  Listen, listen.  I feel bad.  I feel so bad.  They should give you a free subscription to XM Sirius so you could listen to what they  say about you.  I said, this guy was so sweet.  I said, it's Opie and freaking Anthony.  Yeah.  It's what they do.  We're nice guys.  You step out of the studio, they're going to make fun of you.  When I come in, they're going to make fun of you.  It's the Buddy Epson theory.  How great.  That was great radio.  Remember that?  It was great radio.  Oh, you remember the Buddy Epson shit we did? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, listen, listen.  You know what?  It was like this guy...  You tracked this guy's death every day.  Tracked his death.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Tracked his death.  So you're going...  That Buddy doesn't know this?  Of course he knows.  When he comes on, we say, ooh, doggies.  We say, ooh, doggies.  That was great radio.  That was great radio.  That bit took 10 years.  Jesus, right?  That was the longest bit we ever did.  May my bit take as long, please.  I tell you.  Hold on.  I'm going to start with last week.  So Jonathan, Jonathan, it's all fun.  I'm sorry.  He's a rat.  Jonathan's a rat.  No, no.  It's all fun. 
[02:28:00]  It's all fun.  Don't take it seriously.  Joe, focus.  Focus.  They throw you in the water.  Last week it was revealed that you fell behind on the child support.  And that's what you want to talk about, right?  Yeah, because $2 million isn't enough.  But you know what, ladies and gentlemen?  You know what, ladies and gentlemen?  So I go on...  Now, this is where you guys...  We'll see on a crawl on CNN.  We'll see on Fox.  Episcopo said it on O.P. Anthony's show today.  So let's make the news a little bit.  You probably said Episcopo said it on a radio show.  They won't put on...  No, they will, though.  But that's how you elevate it.  You know what I mean?  Am I right or wrong? 
[02:28:30]  You know, you become credible like that.  I've had it.  I've hit the wall.  I hear you.  Because, oh my freaking gosh, I can't do it anymore.  How long did you go through with that?  I went through...  I was married for nine years.  No kids, though, thank God.  Yeah.  But the divorce took over three years of just delays and trying to wear me down.  And in the interim, me paying through the nose for everything.  Her lawyer.  To screw me, I gotta pay him.  And then the amount of money... 
[02:29:00]  You gotta pay the lawyer, that's gonna screw you.  You do.  That's amazing, isn't it?  The amount of money I had to pour out to her and the lawyer...  The only saving grace is, when I open the newspaper now and I see that her lawyer, Dominic  Barbara, was her lawyer, is so screwed, karma came back and chewed his ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I couldn't be happier.  Couldn't happen to a better guy.  We're gonna talk open here.  I'm gonna get in trouble.  I will.  Whatever.  Will you come due to remote in jail?  I will.  Absolutely.  So her lawyer...  Now listen, first of all, mother of my children, so I gotta be guarded on that.  Exactly. 
[02:29:30]  First of all, 20 pretty good years, you know, with the babysitter.  She was very young, I understand it.  And you know, to this day, I love her dearly.  Mother of my children.  But she gets the lawyer.  You know who she gets the lawyer?  The guy who is now the prosecutor for Hunterdon County.  Not to name names, Tony Kearns.  Oh my God, what a freaking...  This guy, in my opinion, Your Honor, this was so wrong, took me for all the money.  It's money out of the mouths of my children.  They don't use this money for child support.  No, no, no.  It was not child support.  It was alimony.  I stopped it.  I said, you got...  No.  I gave out so much money. 
[02:30:00]  Then I gotta pay...  You have to pay $12 for the school trip.  It's like, oh, wow!  Didn't I just lay out this millions of dollars?  Isn't that part of the support?  They don't...  So, this is what happens.  So I go...  I go to their side.  We say, please, let's settle out of court.  Because I don't...  It's the children, man.  It's about the kids.  Let's settle out of court.  Plus, it cuts down on legal fees to settle out of court.  Right, yeah.  The longer they litigate...  The lawyers want it to keep going.  Thank you.  This is exactly what I did, by the way.  So I got my guy, Anthony Pope.  Well, you need...  This is one of the best attorneys ever.  Anthony's the best.  So he goes...  He talks to their lawyer. 
[02:30:30]  And how unjust and inappropriate is this?  And conflict of interest is this.  The prosecutor of Hunterdon County now...  This is the law firm that goes into the Hunterdon County jail.  I mean...  So it's like...  It's like, you know, the middle of the boondocks there.  And I'm going to get screwed no matter what, you know?  So I say, let's settle out of court.  Let's settle out of court.  No, no, no, no.  Anthony, you know all too well.  All you got to do is keep paying.  So it's extortion.  So you keep paying, not extortion.  Keep paying.  And I pay.  And I'm good.  And I'm a loyal father.  And every morning I get up.  And I make lunches.  And I do homework.  And I make the doctor appointments. 
[02:31:00]  Don't get me freaking started.  I am as dedicated as father as anybody on this earth.  Don't talk to me about child support.  You show me some child support.  I take care of these kids.  I buy the freaking clothes.  I go to Walmart.  Joe, how are you?  What are you doing at Walmart?  I'm a single father.  I'm a hard worker father.  I sweat on that stage, whether you like it or not, what I do on stage.  I break my ass.  Break my ass on that stage.  Sweat blood on that stage.  Playing those freaking drums.  Playing the music.  My life is a constant rehearsal.  We want that money.  We want to suck that money dry. 
[02:31:30]  You know?  You're working to pay her.  You know?  Not that it bothers me.  Don't get me wrong.  How long into it did you realize there might be some problems here?  That's a fine question.  You know what?  Really?  Like about before the marriage a little bit.  Oh, my God.  What kind of indicators?  Because comics are perceptive.  It's like, you know, it's like, what kind of...  Yeah, normally we pick up on shit.  What were some of the signs of?  If somebody heckles, you immediately know what they're doing.  What were the signs? 
[02:32:00]  And again, I got to be careful because...  Right, right.  Maybe, you know, I don't want to...  It was just...  You know when the woman stuff starts happening, you know?  They start getting into the mood thing.  Yeah.  And it gets kind of like nasty and stuff like that.  Uh-huh.  I never saw that before and I started to see it.  I thought, well, I'll get married.  And then it'll settle everything.  Oh.  Okay.  Well, we'll have kids.  And then...  Oh, no.  So I hung in.  I'm a dead...  I'm a schmuck.  And do I mess around?  Ask me, guys.  How many chicks on the road?  Mr. Norton, if I may, sir.  I submit to you.  How many chicks are available to us on the road?  Whether we're ugly as we are. 
[02:32:30]  I mean, how many...  How many freaking broads come up and go,  Oh, hey, I saw you on stage.  And you know what I'm saying?  Did I?  Did I go once?  Not one time.  You didn't.  What are you doing?  Not one time.  No.  So you were a faithful guy.  The broad that I met at N.E.W. that day.  Bring her back to me, please.  Except she's like, what, 60 now?  Yeah, right.  So anyway, so we go to Settolatic Court.  Let's Settolatic Court.  Sure.  And I keep doing this.  I keep paying out, paying out.  And it's like extortion, paying out.  Then all of a sudden, they go, okay, we'll settle. 
[02:33:00]  And my lawyer and her lawyer, and to Kimberly's credit, we settle out of court.  We go, okay, we're going to make, because I've had it.  It's wrong.  I've taken a stance right here, right now.  On the opening Anthony show, I'm taking a freaking stance.  I'm not going to get railroaded anymore.  I'm a dedicated father.  Both sides could use that money better.  You know what?  I'm telling you.  Giving it to the lawyers, right, Joe?  Guys, guys, I'm telling you.  So anyway, so we go in.  You know who says, who says, oh, you can't settle?  The state.  The great state of my freaking New Jersey.  Because they want to make themselves, like, have a reason for getting pension and welfare. 
[02:33:30]  I don't know.  How can they say that?  They said, the state said, no, you can't settle.  You know, both parties want to settle out of court.  The state says no.  We settled.  And to Kimberly's credit, she says, okay, just give me all the money.  I said, take the freaking money.  Just let's settle out of court.  Once it goes to court, it's going to turn into this, what you're reading.  Nope.  So I said, so you know what?  The state goes, you've got to come in.  I can't go.  Oh, this is the best one.  You love this one?  And I know you've heard this before.  I've got to work.  I've got to go to Phoenix.  I've got to go work the talking state.  They said, can't.  You've got to come into court. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, man.  Guys, if I don't work, I can't pay all this money you people want, man.  There's no fucking right reason to it.  You know what I'm saying?  It's crazy.  So they wouldn't let me work.  So Anthony Pope fixes it.  It's all great.  Her lawyer, in Tony Kern's old firm, her lawyer, they fix it up.  And it's like, this is going to work out.  The state goes, no, you've got to come in like that.  It's like, they've got to make trouble.  It's like, just let us all work it out.  But I'm taking a stance now.  I've had it.  You know what?  How old are the kids?  You know what?  I've got them.  Take your pick.  I've got so many of them now. 
[02:34:30]  But with the Kimberly broad.  Yeah.  Oh, I've got another story I should tell you.  You guys are going to kill me.  I'm going to hear about this.  Can we talk?  How old are the kids?  13, 10, and 8.  With Kimberly.  So there's a lot of years left.  So you've got a lot of years left.  That's why I'm bringing that up.  I'll be in Des Moines.  I'll be in Des Moines.  Where am I?  What city is it?  10 years of child support?  It's something like that.  You're going to college, too.  I think until they're 21 now.  Because at college, you have to pay for college, too.  Wow.  No, that's another thing you've got to do.  That's a good point.  So why are you living in a closet at this point?  No, grace of God.  Grace of God Almighty.  You all right with that, Joe?  Grace of God Almighty. 
[02:35:00]  You know, it's all good.  Joe, let me ask you, too.  Because you're a very famous guy.  Where did the bulk of your money came from?  Was it, is it road gigs?  Or was it investments?  Or was it like, I know you had workout shit that you were doing.  Where is the big bulk of what makes you?  A little old.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, but you know what?  I think it was the Miller Beer commercials.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it was good.  You know?  In the early 80s.  Not to mention, that in Bally.  Remember Bally?  That's what I meant in Bally.  Oh, yes.  But you know what?  So it's interesting.  But as we work, and it's live.  But I'm not like a $20 million movie star. 
[02:35:30]  You know, you guys bust my chops.  And I come on here in fun.  And you have the right to bust my chops.  I lead with my freaking chin.  It's okay.  I don't care.  But I don't go in and make $10 million of film, for God's sake.  I'm a working stiff.  They'll certainly make it sound like you do.  Oh, my God.  Future earning potential.  Oh, he could make billions of dollars.  They say celebrity goodwill.  On my first case.  To your point.  They say celebrity goodwill.  When I went into court first with Joey's mom.  Great gal, by the way.  And it was very amicable.  Mr. Piscopo made millions. 
[02:36:00]  He'll make millions more.  Right.  But they don't talk about the bad months.  The bad weeks.  You know, the bad things.  When you're calling your agent going, hey, I'm available.  There are no guarantees.  Why is it guaranteed money for her?  Unbelievable.  But they don't care.  And the state, God bless our wonderful state workers.  I mean, God bless these guys.  And not all the workers, you know, because we love our toll takers.  But in the family court system of New Jersey, if I may, they have no idea how real life works.  They don't know how we got to get on a plane, Jim.  We got to go on.  You got to perform.  You got to rehearse all this. 
[02:36:30]  You got to go up.  You got to work it out.  Then you got to get on.  Then I get on a plane.  And then I come home to my kids.  I come right home to my kids.  And I'm with my children Sunday through Wednesday.  I'm with my children.  And if I may, I don't want to drop a bomb here, but when Kimberly was arrested for endangering  the lives of the children, and Dyfus, and I feel bad for her.  It's a problem.  And you know what?  She's better.  It's been almost three years in March.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what happened?  Just for anyone who's not, who's tuning in late, can you just give a brief explanation 
[02:37:00]  of that just so people are caught up?  And I want to say, I don't want any show right here, man.  I didn't want to say anything.  And I kept it quiet for seven years.  Right, right.  And I had the children when she was in rehab for 30 days.  I came back from Florida working four or five days a week there, working those little  gigs down there.  And I came back and I took my kids.  And I was the principal of the school that says, Joe, you're the safety net of these  children.  And I was the safety net of these kids.  And now I have them Sunday through Wednesday.  But when she got her license taken away, it was an incident. 
[02:37:30]  And I said, I don't want to talk about it, but if they want to open it up and they want  to have the paper here, you know what I'm saying?  And again, it's a problem, but you know, I mean, I'm in...  License taken away.  I'm going to guess.  My educated guess would be had something to do with driving under the influence with  the kids in the car if that was endangering their lives.  It made me mad.  Oh, man.  How freaking dare you?  No shit.  How freaking dare you?  Don't even freaking start with me.  How dare you take the lives of my children and put them in the backseat and have a drink?  I'm supposed to have sympathy for that? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, it's a disease.  How about the rest of us who have to live with that?  I'm walking on eggshells my whole life over here.  You're financing it.  I'm exactly right, man.  And check this out.  So, no, listen.  She gets arrested, handcuffed, dragged out in front of the presence of my young children,  for God's sake.  I have to...  I land by the grace of Jesus Christ.  That's right.  Jesus Christ and God.  Deal with it, for crying out loud.  I'm a hopeless Italian Catholic.  I've got to get that little plug in there.  I turn on my phone as I land.  Who's got Difus on the phone? 
[02:38:30]  Division of Youth and Family Services.  Two police stations.  Your wife has been arrested.  Your children are now in foster care.  Holy shit.  Don't...  Your children are now in foster care.  You must have lost your mind.  Wow.  And I ran right...  Got to my driver.  He goes, hello, Mr. Piscuit.  Shut the freak up.  Get in your car and take...  I had the kids in my possession for half an hour.  In a half an hour, I had those kids.  And you know what?  I got those kids, and I took them, and I kept them with me for a month.  And she went to rehab.  The judge, Ann Bartlett, not to mention names, in my opinion, one of the worst people on 
[02:39:00]  the benches, how New Jersey even appointed this woman, Ann Bartlett, makes me pay child  support while she's in rehab.  And I have full custody.  Full custody of the kids.  Difus takes the kids away.  Says, give them the Joe.  Look how great father he is.  Difus comes in.  They look at my house.  They give me the kids.  She goes, and they decrease the child support, but they make me pay child support while she's  not there for 30 days. 
[02:39:30]  You're the one...  And you know what else, ladies and gentlemen?  Let me tell you.  Where you from, pal?  Where you from?  Nice time.  You're the one supporting the children.  Why do you have to then pay above and beyond that?  And you said the drinking, you were walking on eggshells for a long time.  When you live with somebody that drinks, it's fucking, it's like you're not the one with  the problem, so you're watching them.  Wow.  And we're always guilty.  And we're men.  And we're guilty.  How could the judge do that?  And then I go to court.  And then they go, and then after the fact, I go into court.  And then she takes me in for all these bills.  With the stuff that you read.  It's not child support.  It's alimony.  Right, right. 
[02:40:00]  It's all for her, so the boyfriend.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to help you out here.  They make it look like you're a scumbag that you're not paying child support.  Exactly right.  When you are paying child support, and it's more money for her than you are doing.  I have given this.  Gotcha, Joe.  Listen, the donation I've made is a 401k for any average American.  What she gets is 10 times, maybe 20 times what the average American makes.  This is what I give out.  And then I got to live on myself.  You know, I got to give the kids a home.  And then I was in a hotel.  By the way, this is funny.  I go to a hotel after the divorce, because, you know, we have to leave the house as guys, 
[02:40:30]  right?  I'll leave that.  So I go to a hotel.  I like hotels, man.  I mean, how great are hotels?  I love a hotel, man.  Hey, valet, kids, clean your room.  Now forget about it.  Maid service, please.  Throw your crap around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maid service.  Wait, you're living in a hotel now?  No, I was early on.  So then the court says, you can't live in a hotel.  We'll take the children away.  You've got to get a house.  I get a house.  You're spending too much money on the house.  You can't win here, guys.  So I come here, and I know we have fun.  And I know you ride me, and you drive me.  Oh, we're going to hug you at the end of this.  But let me have some love to ONAs. 
[02:41:00]  I need the love.  January 19th.  Hold on, let me plug Joe's day.  January 19th.  I had a tough week, buddy.  January 19th, Joe will be at Brick High School, performing with our pal Jeff Norris.  Yeah, Jeff's the best.  I like Jeff very much.  And January 26th, the Dix Hills Performing Arts Center.  And you can go to dhpac.org and get Dix Hills Performing Arts Center, January 26th, if  you want to go out and see Joe and support him.  I certainly, I would love to go to one of these shows, actually. 
[02:41:30]  You should play Dix Hills, by the way.  I don't know if I could sell it, but I would certainly want to go see you.  No, I think you couldn't.  Oh, I think you wouldn't.  Are you serious?  Long Island?  I'll talk to Marty.  Is that Long Island?  Yeah, you destroy it.  Jim, you would kill it.  No, we're going to do the Paramount in Huntington.  Oh, okay.  I'm working.  I'm working with the guys.  Listen, Joe, hold on a second.  I need to ask.  So you lost that awesome house that you got from being an entertainer, right?  What's that?  She gets to keep the real nice house you probably have.  No, I have my beautiful home, thank God.  But I mean, the house you had with her.  Yeah, no, she got that.  My summer home's six minutes away, you mean? 
[02:42:00]  Yep, that's exactly what it is.  Yep, she got that, too.  How is that fair?  I'm not telling you the half of it because she is the mother of my children.  I'm respecting that.  Anthony knows.  Anthony knows.  I don't want to delve into it.  It's not fair, but don't you dare.  Don't you dare.  You know what?  I am like, when they come on, they go, Joe, we'll be an anti, say all these things.  You know what?  You're being naive.  No, I'm not.  You guys know me well enough.  You push me.  You mess with me.  They pushed me.  Yeah, yeah.  They pushed me now.  And I'm taking a stand now. 
[02:42:30]  Can I ask you, Joe, without mentioning any names, was there any infidelity happening at all?  I'm not saying whose side, but was there any?  Not on my part, baby.  But there might have been somewhere.  Yeah.  And you have to eat that.  Oh, my God.  And then you've got to keep it.  I could tell you stories, guys.  And you know what?  You know, when the other party doesn't come home, and this is my favorite.  This is my favorite in court.  I've been seven years of pent-up.  Yes.  I'm on an O&H show.  Howard's going to die that I'm talking to you guys about this.  But you go in.  You go in.  When your assumed-to-be ex walks in. 
[02:43:00]  Am I right or wrong?  Tell me am I right or wrong.  They walk in at 3 o'clock in the morning, you know, whacked out of their mind, you know,  whatever, all disheveled and everything.  And you go, and when you say, honey, where you've been, in court, you are abusive, you're  controlling, and you're angry, and you're angry.  They got the catchphrases.  They put the catchphrases in.  Oh, you're abusive.  I said, where have you been?  I've been with the little kids, you know?  I'm wondering where, yeah, where she's been.  But then you're the asshole.  I don't understand how they justify it.  There's no, they use, there's no personal touch to the cases. 
[02:43:30]  You think, like, oh, I'm going to tell them this, this, they'll listen to it and understand  what's been going on.  It's this slide rule mentality.  You're just numbers, she's numbers, and here's what it is.  You're not a person, you don't have a story, you don't have feelings or any need.  It's all about math.  And what do they think, again, to your point, what do they think, what Opi's reading before,  if it gets in the paper, and it looks like you're back in child support, no, I'm not. 
[02:44:00]  I've taken a stance.  What does that look like, and how does that look for business?  How does that look for business?  These people who are not qualified to make the judgments that you were just talking about,  they're going to judge my life, and they're going to say, oh, Joe, and again, you have  to give Kimberly credit, and her lawyer credit, too, for wanting to settle out of court.  We could have done the whole thing out of court.  The state says you've got to show up.  I'm amazed at that whole thing.  Because, you know what, I would say to our good governor, Christie, who's great, revamp 
[02:44:30]  the family court system in the state of New Jersey.  It never happened right now.  And you know what, this is as antiquated as the electrical grids from JCP&L and PSC&G.  It's ridiculous.  And you know what, now that we have the power failure, no one's going to do the grids.  No one's going to fix it.  We forgot all about it.  We'll have another failure.  But it's the same thing with the family court system.  So what do you do?  Because you're, you know, what do you do to get the anger out?  I mean, it's obviously very angry.  Come on, this show.  It's frustrating, man.  No, you know what these people say, Joe, how do you play the drums, man? 
[02:45:00]  What do you play the drums?  Oh, that's it.  You're thinking of somebody.  You're picturing a face on each one.  You're thinking of somebody.  Put various faces on the air.  Oh, man.  Are you running out of money, Joe?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  You know what?  You're running out of money?  By the grace of God.  Oh, wait a minute now.  Let me see.  Because I'll hear all this in court, by the way.  Oh, I bet.  So let me see.  What should I say?  I am so grateful.  And, you know, just to be able to be working like I'm working.  Yeah, you work.  By the grace of God, it's good.  But I'm afraid to answer that because I'll hear it in court.  Right. 
[02:45:30]  And they'll say, oh, he's got plenty of money.  Well, we might as well take him.  We've got to please more out of here.  They'll take the kids away.  If I tell you what we make in a night or something, you can't.  This is true.  They go, we'll settle out of court.  One of the prerequisites for settling out of court.  This is my favorite.  We want to see your contract.  We want to see one of your contracts.  So Anthony and I, in good faith, we go, oh, that's why I email the contract.  They use it in court.  Like, see how much he makes?  Rather than because it was like, here it is.  The money's there.  But I can't do it anymore. 
[02:46:00]  So, you know, after this show, I'm.  Now, did they want a past contract?  There's no way they're going to sell them.  Did they want a past contract or a future one?  Because you should have just had the lowest paying gig of the year.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't take the New Year's Eve contract.  Yeah, you laugh.  Don't assume they're going to do the right thing.  The stress factory one.  Yeah.  You laugh, but you shouldn't assume that shit.  I know, but I'm too honest, guys.  Did you, do you lead with your heart?  You lead with your heart, man.  You lead with your heart.  You don't get it stomped off here.  You're out to get you.  How old are you now, Joe?  Thanks, guys. 
[02:46:30]  This is therapeutic for me, huh?  I'm 49 because I go out with young women.  Okay, there we go.  Fair enough.  There you go.  Don't ask me.  No, I got.  Did you ever think of doing.  This is such interesting stuff.  Did you ever think of doing a one-man show about this stuff?  Like, what you can say?  Like, I love.  It's a great idea.  I genuinely enjoy this part of comedians and people.  Like, I love because.  The anger?  But, you know, the fucking real life stuff is fascinating to me.  I could listen to this for fucking hours, man.  Deal with that.  It's honest.  It's interesting.  How many times were you married, Joe?  You know what?  Twice.  You know what, though?  My shows have never been better. 
[02:47:00]  I walked out.  I was exhausted when I went to Phoenix.  After talking to you guys, it was so.  It was fun.  I find this very exhilarating, by the way.  I really do.  So, listen.  I go to Phoenix, and I'm tired, man.  I'm tired.  You know?  Because you saw my age.  Don't tell anybody.  But you saw my age.  And so, I'm going, wait a minute.  I'm tired.  But then, I go, wait a minute.  I rest.  I eat right.  You know?  I carve up.  I got a big show to do Saturday night.  I go on stage.  But, again.  By the grace of God.  I don't know where we pull it out from.  Like, you guys got to get up so early in the morning.  You pull it out.  It was the best show I ever had in my life. 
[02:47:30]  Saturday night.  Yeah.  Because all the anxiety.  They think.  Matter of fact, when we were at the Club Piscopo in Lake City last year.  We would go five of nine.  Shows were at nine.  Five of nine.  All the iPhones would go off.  All the ex-wives from all the crew.  Oh, shit.  They would bust your chops right before showtime.  And get you.  It drives us on stage, man.  You know why?  We're looking for more approval from the audience.  It makes our shows better.  So, you know what?  They could just kiss our butts.  I'm not going down.  I'm not going down.  How's the, uh.  That's a great name for a one-band show. 
[02:48:00]  Joe Piscopo.  I'm not going down.  I'm not going down.  Oh, guys.  Thank you.  You never knocked me down, Ray.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Thank you.  I never went down, Ray.  I never went down, Ray.  Ray.  I love that.  And then I want.  You know what else?  I want to go to court.  I want to do this speech.  You're the Godfather, you know?  You know what I'm going to offer?  You know what I'm going to offer?  Nothing.  Nothing.  As a matter of fact, I would appreciate it if you would pay for the license.  Right, right, right.  We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  You know, I love those things.  Where do you get the energy from, Joe? 
[02:48:30]  You know, I got pumped to come here today.  And I'm working.  Last night, I was with my buddy Mitch Modell.  We had a great event last night.  And then with Anthony Pope, we, you know what I was with last night?  Dina Manzo from the Housewives of New Jersey, you know?  Oh, wow.  I know, really.  What a lovely gal.  Nice gal.  She's beautiful.  Helping kids.  You know what?  She's pretty hot.  For her age, she's fucking beautiful.  I'm telling you what.  I know exactly who you're talking about.  And how old do you think she is now?  Because, you know, I have a limit on my age.  I would guess mid-40s.  My girlfriend, you heard that joke.  Did you hear the joke?  My girlfriend's supposed to be here, but she has an algebra test this morning. 
[02:49:00]  So I said, I'll tell you.  So, but, you know, yeah, 40s.  But she was nice, but we're helping cancer kids, you know?  And you do a lot of charity work, too.  So Joe is always, like, any time you see what Joe is doing, you look and go like, holy shit,  he's doing a lot of money.  He's trying to hide money.  No, I'm not.  He's trying to hide money.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  You got a charity, I got a tuxedo.  You got a charity, I got a tuxedo.  I come early, I stay late.  There's not a charity around that's not worthy of my considerable talents.  Are you burning money around America at this point?  No, no.  Joe's been doing charity for years, though.  Joe is a nice guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he is.  We know that. 
[02:49:30]  I'll plug this.  He's a featured act at the First Responder Fundraiser Friday.  Yep.  It's December the 21st, 730.  It's a Holiday Inn, and it's on Route 72 East in Manohawken.  So for tickets, if you want to go see Joe at a fundraiser, 609-698-3041.  However, you should wait until January 19th and 26th and see him where Joe gets the money.  Because Joe's got some fucking bills to pay.  So benefits are nice, but go see Joe where he's getting the money.  Except not Dixels, but I'm sorry.  But the one, you know what, for Long Beach Island, a couple firefighters lost their homes. 
[02:50:00]  They lost their homes.  And that's another thing.  You go to court and you talk to these.  And again, there's about four great judges in the family court system in New Jersey.  Four, and I've appeared before every one of them.  And the four great.  But some of them, they don't have any idea how hard these people work.  Firefighters lost their homes, man.  So we're going to go do benefits there.  And on the 19th at Brick Township, it's actually at Brick High School we're going to do that.  Because they got slammed down there.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I want to bring this back to how we started thinking about you again. 
[02:50:30]  The song Kimberly.  Did you have a Channel 9 show?  We did.  Oh, my God.  Listen, there's some things, as I get older, and we can talk about it, under the career title of What Was I Thinking?  Well, we all have that.  We all have that, but I want to walk you through it.  Joe, why was it?  I'm at that point in my career now, actually.  I don't think I'm doing.  Why wasn't there any jokes, and you sang that song just straight like you did?  And then she came out at the end.  It was so awkward.  Yeah, it was.  Awkward and awful and blindly in love. 
[02:51:00]  Blindly in love.  That's why I want to bring it up.  You were so in love.  Can I show that in court, you think?  You think that would work in court?  That is the worst thing a guy could be in, is blindly in love.  Can I tell you what else?  Let's do shit.  We were waiting for the jokes.  I know.  It's Joe Piscovo.  He's going to spin this shit, and you're not responding.  You know why?  Can I tell you why?  Yeah.  It was a birthday.  It was a birthday.  And I've got to tell you, it was Channel 9.  And do respect to Channel 9 now, because it's the only station in the black in the market now.  I didn't think anybody was watching. 
[02:51:30]  And you want to know something else?  I can tell you, when I would go on Howard early on, I didn't think anyone was listening.  Oh, boy.  I swear to God.  I went on Howard when he couldn't get arrested.  I went on Howard on NBC.  We got the, we got the, went on Saturday Night Live and went upstairs.  Howard Stern, a new guy from Washington, D.C., wants to talk.  No one, they were all afraid.  I would go on.  I didn't think anyone was listening.  To answer your question, I didn't think anyone was watching.  I do have another part to this.  So then you do.  Oh, Jesus, not stopping.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, in a weird way, it's something we all have to deal with. 
[02:52:00]  So you do this thing, and you assume, all right, no one will ever see this fucking thing again.  It's a one-off.  And then the YouTube starts up, and now people can see this stuff that would have been buried.  I know.  That's right.  It really is.  And some of the stuff, you want to stick around.  And matter of fact, one of your great listeners wanted me to talk about dead heat.  Talk about dead heat.  In the film, Treat Williams and I Die and Come Back to Life.  Unfortunately, that's what happened to the film.  It just went away, but there's so many avenues of distribution now, it came right back. 
[02:52:30]  Did they show it in any other countries?  You know, that's where I was in Japan.  I was in Mexico.  In Japan, they go, what do you thought?  Don't you tell you?  Dead heat.  They love that.  They love it.  You know?  Or in Mexico, I was going through custom.  La totina con los sotan chico son dead heat.  They know those.  The only thing you hear in English is that one word.  That's so true.  So, should I talk about some other stuff, too?  You got time?  We got to go.  What are you doing?  No, we got some time.  We're using it until we get out of here.  I am loving Joe Piffle.  Absolutely.  I don't know.  I don't know if I should talk about this. 
[02:53:00]  You guys are going to kill me.  How many kids you got all together?  You know what?  Five.  I have to tell you.  I have to tell you, boys.  I haven't been completely up front about everything.  I'm going to break the news here on Opie and Anthony's show.  Can I do it?  What happened?  Well, and I, you know, should I talk about it, Jim?  I got to talk about it.  I would go for it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, again, to all your great listeners, thank you.  I need the love, and thank you for being so gracious.  So great.  I want to tell you one wonderful thing.  And I need the help now.  Yes.  Because I'm getting killed.  They're killing me, guys.  They are.  You turned us around. 
[02:53:30]  We're going to hug you.  I'm telling you, Joe.  So I go.  I get an assistant.  I get an assistant, you know?  Yeah.  And I go to my buddy, Joe Muccioli, my music director, and I go to his dressing room.  I'm about to go on stage, and this one chick walks out, and she's a hot chick.  And I go, Mooch.  And he's engaged.  I go, Mooch.  I said, this is your gumara.  This is you doing all right.  He goes, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's the daughter of my friend, daughter of my buddy.  And I go, wow, what do you think?  I need an assistant.  This was almost four years ago.  I didn't talk about it.  Joe.  Sure, that's how you do it.  Joe.  I swear to God.  That's the name of the new show. 
[02:54:00]  Joe.  Do you ever learn?  That's the name of the show.  Oh, listen.  So if I'm going down, I'm going down in style.  I'm a weak man.  I'm a weak man.  Joe.  So you saw this pretty girl.  You said, I need an assistant.  And what happened?  What happened, Joe?  Four years ago.  Micro mini.  Chicken high heels.  Oh, Jesus.  Legs to stop a freaking freight train.  Oh, my God.  You know what I'm saying?  Hot, but jersey hot.  You know what I'm saying?  Like half Jewish, half Italian. 
[02:54:30]  Jersey hot, man.  I was like, whoa, this is not my type.  I usually like, give me the blonde bro with the big things and I'm okay.  You know what I mean?  Like this.  Oh, boy.  This is like, I'm going, what the fuck?  So we, and.  Come on, Joe.  What'd you do?  Well, she's working for me.  She's great.  She's great worker.  How long has she been working for you?  Great worker.  Well, she was working for me.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit, Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  So, and I hope she doesn't mind me talking about it because she's a great gal.  So, we, all of a sudden she goes, I want to get married.  She keeps going like this with the ring.  She's showing her ring finger to me.  I got to get married.  I got to get married.  I said, no, baby, I can't. 
[02:55:00]  I got kids all over.  I can't get married.  I said, I just, let me take care of these kids and one day we'll do something.  I'm going to get married.  And I want a baby.  I want a baby.  I want a baby.  I said, you can't, honey.  Look at me.  I got kids all over the place.  I can't have another child.  I got to take care of this.  Then, the drunk driving thing hits, right?  And that, I'll tell you, I don't care what you say.  How long is the drunk driving thing?  It'll be three years in March, I think.  So, God bless.  And she's doing great, by the way.  Doing just great, by the way.  But, anyway, it's like, Jesus.  I don't have a visual. 
[02:55:30]  No, no, no.  No, so, anyway.  She's doing well, right, Joe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, this chick, I'm afraid to mention her name, but she was there for me, man.  Aside from my mother, God bless my mother, she was there for me.  She took me through, listen, she took me through this time.  She took me through this rough time.  And she took care of my children, like, she was a mother to my children.  She was a friend as well as a lover.  She took care of me.  Joe's got a two-year-old out there.  She knows.  Tell us.  So, no, people don't know.  So, then she goes, all of a sudden, a clear blue sky. 
[02:56:00]  And I've got to tell you guys, I mean, not to be disrespectful.  I know I can say anything because it's actually I'm serious.  Absolutely.  But, these 20-something chicks, oh, my gosh.  Do you know what?  You meet the older bros.  Ow, Joe, you're wonderful.  You're sweet.  You're going, come on, I can take care of you.  No, you can't.  It's like, you got it.  I love Joe.  Am I ready to roll?  Joe's a piece of shit.  The 20-something.  I love Joe.  The 20-somethings.  No, but am I wrong or right?  You're right.  The wild.  Where do they learn this stuff?  Oh, my God.  I'm like Jerry Lewis when I'm with these kids. 
[02:56:30]  Please don't hurt me, lady.  Oh, how did you do that?  It's like unbelievable.  Did you do Jerry Lewis?  So, and I'm going to do Letterman and the rap next.  So, anyway, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, Joe listens.  Oh, Joe listens.  So, sure enough, she goes, you know what?  I'm pregnant like that.  And I go, oh, man, listen to this.  Listen to this.  And I'm going through all this stuff.  And I'm juggling.  And I'm with the kids.  Guys, I'm with the children most of the time. 
[02:57:00]  And listen, listen.  She goes, and I go, and I'm a very, and I don't care what you think out there.  Yeah, well, this is true.  This is true.  What goes around comes around.  You make your own journey.  Point made, Mr. Ope.  Point made.  I'm sorry.  It's so true.  I'm sorry.  So, she goes, now she goes, the young chicks now, they go, oh, we'll get rid of it.  We'll get rid of it.  And I don't believe in that.  I don't believe in that.  Sure.  I said, no matter whose it is, you're going to have it.  Because I didn't see her for three weeks at one point.  And I'm thinking, hey, maybe I'm an old guy.  Come on now.  Better not come out looking like Eddie Murphy.  Come on. 
[02:57:30]  I should be so lucky.  I said, he's got the money to pay for it.  I said, so I go, you know, I go, geez, I said, I don't know.  But just goes through the whole pregnancy.  She goes through the pregnancy, and she's a trooper.  And she's great, you know?  And she gets a midwife.  And so it gets closer.  And I'm watching my kids, and it's Christmas two years ago.  And she gets the call.  And I got my big boy, Joey, who's a superstar in his own right.  This kid's talented.  He's great.  More talented than that.  He's in L.A.  He's a director.  He's an actor.  He's like just a talent.  And he's doing so great work all the time. 
[02:58:00]  God bless him.  He's at the house with the little kids.  And she calls.  And she calls, and she goes, I'm having a baby.  I'm at Morristown Hospital in Jersey.  And I go, I got to go, because she's in labor, right or wrong.  She had the kid, and I'm going to go.  Joey, who's so pissed off at me because I date women that are younger than him,  and that I can't get it together.  He's like the father.  He's like my father.  Joey's more mature than I am.  He goes, Dad, what are you doing?  I said, she's.  You weren't with her anymore, obviously.  We were kind of on and off. 
[02:58:30]  Okay, gotcha.  So I said, Joey, watch the little kids.  I go to the hospital, man.  And I still don't know that it's my baby.  Honestly, guys, we talk very frank here.  So I go to the hospital.  She's got the midwife.  She's in the tub.  She does the tub in the water thing.  And it's all natural, all natural, all natural.  And the midwife goes, all natural.  Yeah, but you could give her a morphine drip because, you know,  nothing more natural than freaking morphine.  What the hell was that?  What was that?  You know, they go morphine.  So what she's doing, she's in the tub.  She's pushing this baby, pushing.  And I'm watching this young girl.  And it's a beautiful thing, how these women, God bless them, 
[02:59:00]  how they have the children.  I'll always respect Kimberly for that, you know,  just to give me beautiful children.  This girl's bringing another life into the world.  And the baby comes out.  And it's kind of dark, you know.  It's kind of like, no, no.  Yeah, the blood's not there.  The eyes are pushed back and kind of, you know,  pushed back a little bit.  I'm thinking it's a black Latino Asian baby.  I'm off the hook, baby.  This is what I'm thinking, you know.  The blood comes back.  Color comes back.  It's like you Photoshop my face.  Oh, shit.  You know those little gookies?  Is it a boy or a girl?  Girl.  Okay, cool.  Beautiful little girl. 
[02:59:30]  Good for you, Joe.  So we had the baby, and it was like,  it was a beautiful thing.  So now I'm walking around.  This is your grandchild, Joe?  Yeah, well, no.  Actually, it's not.  You are like a gangster, yo.  Do you not?  Are you a guy who does not like to pull out?  I find it very difficult to pull out.  I mean, in general.  I could be so graphic here.  And they go, get clipped.  Get clipped.  But you know what?  You know what?  Get clipped.  You know what?  It cuts down on the loads, I think.  It makes the loads smaller if you get clipped.  And I want a bigger one.  Don't record this.  The punishment element.  I'm not.  No comment on that. 
[03:00:00]  Because, you know, I've got to be nice.  But I've got to tell you something.  It's a beautiful thing.  You've got a two-year-old, Joe.  Yeah, and you know what?  She's a great mom.  She's a great mom to this kid.  And I'll see him tomorrow when I see him.  But then I'll tell you what's going to happen.  You know what's going to happen?  The women that I have children with, because all the women see Uncle Joe coming.  They go, get a baby from that guy.  Get his paycheck, because the courts will allow it.  Bring that guy in.  Or get a guy with some money.  Meet some guy with some money. 
[03:00:30]  Get some guy.  They live in my house.  They drive my freaking $100,000 car that I got for her.  And the boys, the guys are like this, driving.  She's driving.  And get somebody with money.  You know, could you, as a man, as a man.  Let me ask.  We've got time.  Sure, sure.  Believe me.  You can't tell them it's seven years pent up, can you?  No.  Oh, my God.  You know, as a man, could you possibly live in another house another man's paying for?  Could you possibly drive another car?  Could you possibly hang around with the children that were given in life by another man? 
[03:01:00]  No.  And sit there and get involved.  Never.  I couldn't do it.  And girls say it to me.  I've had beautiful chicks say to me, Joe, wow.  Come see my kids.  Hang on.  No.  That's the father's responsibility.  I'm my own.  I'm a freaking man.  Joe says, I'll date them when they get a little older.  Well, this is fun making these jokes, guys.  It's so fun not being the brunt of it all the time.  So there's a guy who's kind of hanging out in the place that you paid for and driving 
[03:01:30]  the car that you paid for.  Yeah, not the baby mama, the other one.  Wow.  Wait, which one?  The one that's taking you to court?  Yeah.  Kimberly's got a guy living in your shit.  Are you jealous?  Are you jealous of it?  No, it's a great question.  Norton, great questions, buddy.  Thank you.  It's like, no.  Wow.  Not at all.  And it's so funny.  Soon, I'm Italian.  I'm Italian-American.  You cross the line.  You mess around on me.  And I don't mean this in a literal way.  Right.  You're dead.  Right, right, right.  And I don't mean like a...  She put that in the court papers, by the way.  Oh, boy. 
[03:02:00]  She said, I'm dead.  Meaning you're going to go...  No, no.  You don't exist as a human being.  Jesus.  Because Satan has taken over your soul.  And now I have to deal with the devil.  Okay?  But you don't...  I don't know who you are.  So you don't exist, man.  I'm not dealing with you anymore.  I'm dealing with some satanic creature.  Figuratively speaking, you're not dead.  That's right.  And this is now what I've got to deal with.  Sure.  As soon as they cross the line, that's it.  You know what?  A good friend of mine went through a divorce, and his ex-wife had another guy, and they  didn't get married because she was doing way too well getting the money from my very, 
[03:02:30]  very good friend.  Oh, my God.  So, you know, this lady was with the guy for probably 15 years.  Wow.  And never got married.  No.  Why would they?  Because then, you know, the...  The alimony stops.  The alimony stops.  But that's what...  And when you read that...  How is that fair?  Exactly.  And to everybody who reads this stupid stuff...  I'm very disappointed in the Star-Ledger, by the way.  This is a good newspaper.  This is like my hometown newspaper.  And they went up to my lawyers, and they said, oh, what's going on?  And my lawyers, very...  And Kimberly's lawyers, to her credit as well, said, please don't print anything.  This is a family matter.  They print to freak... 
[03:03:00]  What are you...  They're vultures.  They're vultures.  Well, I'm glad you were able to come on the show and clear it up, in all seriousness.  Because when they say, fell behind on child support, that gets a lot of people angry.  And, you know, what the fuck, she's not taking care of his kids?  And, guys, thank you for the forum.  Because, you know what?  I'm with my children most of the time.  And you're here to say, I just want to help you out, that that is absolutely not true.  That's absolutely not true.  And, you know what?  I stopped.  And it's the alimony, too.  And she's, in my opinion, and I have to say, in my opinion, she's cohabitating.  You know?  In my opinion, I am the primary parent. 
[03:03:30]  When she was in rehab, they gave me...  When Difuss gave me custody for, like, a year and a half, I had the custody.  Plus, I worked.  And people listening now, those hard-working mothers, God bless you.  That's the women that work.  Very sexy to me now, by the way.  Women who work.  Stop, Joe.  I like working girls, too.  But I think for a different reason.  Oh, man.  Working girls.  No, no, you're kind of a working girl, too.  So it's frustrating because I have the children.  And, guys, I don't just show up every other Wednesday.  I don't go, oh, well, every other weekend. 
[03:04:00]  I have the children Sunday through Wednesday.  When she goes out to Cancun with the boyfriend and she sees the children two hours and two weeks,  I have the children the whole time.  I make the lunches.  I do the snacks.  I do the homework, which they give too much homework.  I go to the school functions, you know?  And now I've had it.  And you can hear it in my voice.  I have had it.  It's done.  It's over.  No more free lunch.  I'm coming.  This is it.  You want to throw me in the freaking county jail?  Right, right.  You'll come do the remote.  You promise?  Now, let me, obviously, whenever a woman goes to court in a divorce, they never say. 
[03:04:30]  And now the end is near.  No, go ahead, Joe.  They never say, hey, Joe was a great guy and I wasn't.  So what would somebody say?  What was their point about you?  Because they would never say, hey, Joe was a good guy.  That's just not what people do in court.  They try to dredge shit up.  What was she saying about you that you could probably say might not even be true?  But what was she saying about you?  Yeah, well, just, you know what?  It's a good point.  Just the, like Anthony said, Jim, the amount of money, the amount of money. 
[03:05:00]  When I'm on, it would just be, that's a falsehood that I'm not paying.  Millions of dollars.  I'm embarrassed to tell you how much I pay.  Oh, please.  It's got, it's millions of dollars.  And with the other guy living in that, it's so wrong.  So that's what they say wrong when they accuse you of that stuff and they go, oh, he's not doing this.  He's not doing that.  And I'll tell you what, Kimberly, great mother.  Right now, the kids love her.  And I will respect that always.  And you know what?  I got to sit here among men, all right?  Sure.  And you're four women listeners. 
[03:05:30]  I said among women.  Actually, I got women.  You want them?  They're available.  Yes, they've doubled.  Oh, Joe, you're ones of one.  You got to ask.  Oh, Joe.  Joey, you're so cute.  Come here.  I can take care of you, baby.  You wouldn't be in so much trouble if you went out with someone your own age.  That's it.  That's it.  Shut it.  You have to ask yourself.  I make my own journey.  I accept full responsibility.  And then we have to ask among men right here on the O&A show, was it worth it?  You have to really deep down into your mind and say, was it worth it with this beautiful 
[03:06:00]  young chick?  And I have to tell you, honestly, every single second.  Every second.  Every second.  Ass is like snare drums, Joe.  Ass is like a snare.  Boom.  Boom.  You're still famous, Joe.  Boom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They brought the photographer in.  They don't bring the photographer in for just anyone.  Fantastic.  But I tell you what.  I'm going to go out with Joe.  He's more than willing.  Oh, God.  And you know, what am I doing?  So stay tuned.  And then I'm with my buddy Steve Califf for tonight if he still wants to hire me tonight. 
[03:06:30]  I'll be down there.  I want to ask you something.  What's that?  When was the last time you talked to Eddie Murphy?  You know what, a while.  Someone you used to do a lot of shit with.  He's a big star.  They don't want anything to do with me.  Oh, boy.  You know what?  I stay in Jersey.  Were you guys close for a while there?  That's the best.  I could tell stories.  I could write the book, but I'm Italian.  I don't talk.  That's what you need.  I know.  The book.  Yeah, but I got to be careful.  Like, as we speak here, I have to protect myself because of that stupid Star Ledger doing  stuff like that, you know?  But you know what?  With Eddie, I don't want to.  I can think of stories now that are pretty funny for the radio, but I have to respect it. 
[03:07:00]  They never wrote the SNL book.  Does it bother you when, like, if somebody moves on in their career and they don't kind  of help out a little bit?  Nah, man.  You know what?  When I started out, man, and you know, you do the grunt work of the comedy stuff.  You know what it is.  And you, me, and Jeff Norris.  It's all the same.  It doesn't change and everything.  And when I started out, man, all I wanted to do is exactly what I'm doing now, being  a working stiff.  I'm in the blue collar of entertainment.  Pay alimony?  Yeah, pay alimony.  Jesus, Opie.  That's brutal.  I'm sorry. 
[03:07:30]  You're such a jerk.  I'm sorry.  But you know what?  You're such a schmuck.  But you've turned everybody.  The whole audience loves you.  Yes.  I'm looking at my Twitter and the instant feedback.  People are like, oh, fuck.  I need help.  I need help.  I need help.  But anyway.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No, but all I want to do is work.  So one of the great thrills for me as a performer was being next to the great Eddie Murphy, man.  This guy, you're a comic genius or you're not.  I'm going to work in stiff.  I work on stage.  I got to keep dancing, man.  Because, I mean, that's my thing. 
[03:08:00]  I need to keep dancing.  Keep moving.  You know what?  He's sweating.  He's sweating.  He's working.  He's playing those instruments.  He, my, that was okay.  That was okay.  I got my money's worth.  Murphy, you know, there's a handful.  And I'm trying to think as we go through comic geniuses.  Come on, boys.  Murphy.  Pryor.  Oh, we got the whole name.  Pryor.  George Carlin is one of our guys.  No, no.  George was great.  But George turns into an angry old man.  God bless him.  God bless him.  But brilliant.  Brilliant angry old man.  But an angry old man.  I agree with you.  But I thought toward the end, especially.  I preferred him.  Kind of like me. 
[03:08:30]  No, I preferred Carlin at the end, too.  I preferred him at the end.  Carlin is my number one.  Carlin is my number one of all time.  Jimmy's number one is Pryor.  Pryor is the guy.  Oh, you know what I got to tell you?  Woody Allen.  Woody Allen.  There you go.  There you go.  But there's very few.  On a handful.  Steve Morton.  Steve Morton, you know?  For me, you know.  But he blew off comedy a long time ago.  Yeah, you mean his stand-up voice.  So when I'm taking this ride, Murphy, I'm about to step on SNL, man.  I'm about to step on the Weekend Update.  First time with this young kid, Eddie Murphy.  19 years old.  Wow.  19 years old from Roosevelt, Long Island. 
[03:09:00]  And I hear him.  He's behind me.  And he writes a sketch for the first time on SNL.  He writes a sketch saying there's too many white guys in the NBA.  There should be no white men in the NBA.  Very funny.  I said, that's very funny.  You play the basketball guy.  We'll put you on phone books.  I'll do the sports guy.  Hello again, everybody.  Joe Piscopo Live.  That kind of thing, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You do.  So we're about to step on.  And I swear he goes.  I hear him whisper to himself.  Murphy.  Whisper to himself.  First time on an in-one national TV spot.  The kid's at Roosevelt High.  I'll never believe this. 
[03:09:30]  He's in high school.  He's at a freaking high school.  Steps on.  Smokes it.  And I'm right next to this.  That's a pretty exhilarating ride.  And, you know, if you don't, you don't, because I see guys, they would get jealous of Ed.  And I don't want to mention names.  Oh, my God.  There was like a lot of jealousy happening.  Because Murphy would never read a script.  Murphy would never look at anything.  He'd walk on the air.  He'd smoke everybody.  And he killed her, yeah.  And when you're live on the air with Eddie, you know, and you had 20 million people back in those days.  And you were with Murphy.  It was a ride.  I can't describe.  How many years did you guys do together? 
[03:10:00]  It was four and a half.  Oh, it was longer than I thought.  80 to 84.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that, yeah.  But it was a great ride.  So, to answer your question, it was a lot of fun.  Was that Dick Ebersole's reign?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you work for Lauren at all?  It was all Dick?  No.  Lauren's the grand, high, exalted mystic ruler, man.  Lauren's the guy.  Lauren is the guy.  He's a genius.  And talk about geniuses.  I mean, this guy's a intelligent genius.  But, no.  It was Ebersole's guy.  Ebersole's a great producer.  It was all right.  Dick and I had our moments.  We had almost fist-to-cuff moments.  I'll tell you what.  The book has not been written, ladies and gentlemen.  You know, he was a Yalie.  He was like the plaid pants kind of thing. 
[03:10:30]  You know what I'm saying?  And, you know, I'm from Bloomfield, New Jersey.  You know, I'm an Essex County guy.  So, we clashed a lot.  But, through adversity comes great comedy.  As we've experienced today, ladies and gentlemen.  What was finally your exit from the show, if I could ask?  You know what?  I, when Eddie was leaving.  Because I used to lean on Eddie a little bit.  I think it's safe to say.  When Murphy.  Because it was fun with Eddie.  And I love Timmy Kazerinsky.  You guys remember.  Yeah.  You guys get your audience.  And, by the way.  You guys did great skits together.  Yeah.  Great skits.  Mary Gross was great.  Don't forget, Julie Louis-Dreyfuss was on the show.  Right.  I actually did not know that.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Remember that?  So, she was great.  Wait, wait.  Who was your cast again?  It was Tim Kazerinsky.  Mary Gross.  Robin Duke.  Brilliant.  Brilliant comedian.  I know.  The Winers.  Remember the Winers?  She was my partner.  Right.  And then, of course, Eddie.  When Eddie went and he started doing 48 hours and everything, it wasn't as fun as it  was.  And it's a high-pressure gig.  I don't know how you guys do five hours of radio every morning here.  We've talked to Brewer about that, too.  He's enlightened us about SNL and said that the pressure, the pressure to get your  ass.  Get on the air. 
[03:11:30]  Get your script.  Material.  Yeah, yeah.  There's some material coming from.  Amazing.  And if you didn't write for yourself, you weren't on the air.  You weren't on.  Right.  We just wrote.  We wrote for ourselves.  You'd hunker in trenches, man.  Yeah.  And we would write and try to come up with the stuff.  But fondest of memories.  But you burn out after a while.  Right, right, right.  So you guys weren't friends, really, outside SNL, you and Eddie Murphy?  Like, close as brothers.  You were close as brothers.  I said, no, then when, you know what, we used to go over to his house.  And then he said, he wouldn't let me leave because he started, I was in Jersey.  He was in Long Island.  I said, come to Jersey. 
[03:12:00]  So he comes to Alpine, New Jersey.  He came to Lilletown.  He was the only Negro in town.  You know, it was like, hey, here comes Eddie.  Oh, a black man in Alpine, New Jersey, you know.  And he came in.  And we lived two minutes from the house.  Christmas morning, man.  He would show up.  He'd always have something for Joey, my boy.  I'll tell you, it was a love affair.  Then we went on.  But he got so into the mega superstar realm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I think I felt, I didn't want to bother him.  I pulled out a little, so to speak, Jim.  I pulled out a little bit, you know.  Maybe you should have been well.  No.  Don't, don't, don't.  Peep, Joe.  So anyway, no, no, don't. 
[03:12:30]  Let's change the subject all of a sudden.  You know, you're allowed to wash your sheets.  Believe me.  Me and you, I think, are cut from a similar cloth.  But I'm not afraid to put my sheets in the washing machine.  Cut from the same fucking lack of condom cloth.  Are you still paying, if I may add?  No, no.  That ended back.  But how many years you had to pay?  I had to pay for the entire time, the equal time of the marriage.  Nine years total.  I had to pay.  No kids.  No kids.  No house.  No house.  No nothing.  In New York State? 
[03:13:00]  Barely a car.  New York or Jersey?  New York.  It's as bad as Jersey?  Just as bad.  And then did they get, if I may ask, I mean, since we're all being honest here, future  earnings from the show here?  No, no.  It turned, we settled.  They were looking for future earnings and everything.  I was literally on the stand being questioned by her lawyer.  And I just went, I went, Your Honor, I want to go into a room and settle this.  Like I had had it.  It was too much.  I looked, there's a post in a Daily News reporter sitting there, jotting shit down. 
[03:13:30]  I'm talking about, you know, threesomes and things that happened.  And I'm just like, this can't be good.  Let me just see if I can settle this out.  Oh, man.  So I wound up settling out.  We wrote up, you know, the whole thing with all the stipulations and all that happy horse  shit.  And that was it.  And, you know, good riddance.  Thank God I didn't have any kids with her.  Or I would have to have some kind of contact with her.  I haven't seen her yet.  Last person to see her, I think, was, oh, sorry, leaving a bar and hopping on the back  of some motorcycle guys, some fucking biker guy, his bike, and off into the sunset. 
[03:14:00]  I showed him the picture in the video.  Hilarious.  I know.  Fuck.  So what do we...  Bon voyage.  Oh, God.  Apparently she bought a house and then started just giving her money away to people.  She might not have any left, right?  I hope not.  Just rumors.  No.  It's not fair.  It's like the joke I did in the special where you want to be at your funeral, face down  with your butt out of the coffin with your wallet out.  Help yourself when I'm dead, take my money.  And you know what?  When I go down, and when I do go down, let me tell you, my friend, I'll tell you what, 
[03:14:30]  I'm holding on to that trust fund.  I'm going to drool.  I told my son, Joey, let me stay alive.  I'll be drooling down my nose, down my face, drooling.  I ain't going anywhere.  And then I'm going to have the baby mama.  And then I'm going to have the other one.  Oh, my God.  He's dead, right?  He's dead.  Pull the plug.  Pull the plug.  He won my...  I'm hanging on, brother.  I ain't going anywhere.  How's the love life now?  Are you romantically involved anywhere?  It fascinates me.  Look at me.  Look at this face.  Look at me.  It fascinates me.  Look at me.  Look at my age. 
[03:15:00]  I can't believe...  I'll tell you what.  It's fascinating.  It's crazy.  It is fascinating.  No more kids, Joe.  No more kids.  When does it stop?  When does the...  When does it stop?  You know, you...  Are we just saying...  No, I got you guys.  You got me a few.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More than a few, I think.  But then you're being kind.  Thank you.  But I'm telling you, when does it freaking stop?  I want to just go home and say, let's watch the game.  No.  No.  It's got...  I go to...  Joe, you give me hope.  I can look at you and pretty much gauge when it's all going to end.  They haven't got him. 
[03:15:30]  They haven't got him yet.  Guys, I tell you, thank you.  It's been therapeutic.  I needed to get this out.  Yes.  I mean, I'm just so frustrated.  I hear you.  I've been so dedicated.  My children are my life.  I joke about the women.  It's the children.  Right, right, right.  It's all about the kids, man.  And you know what?  I want to...  I'll have 10 kids.  I got two more kids than me.  Jesus, Joe.  Joe, let me take a picture for you guys.  Just Photoshop the red out.  I'm just about to...  For the Twitter, Joe.  There it is.  Oh, the guys are great.  The Twitter.  And Joe on Twitter.  Smiling, smiling. 
[03:16:00]  I know.  Who are you on Twitter?  J-R...  Try to take a picture with them.  Will you stay still?  Oh, sorry, sorry.  J-R-Z-Y-J-O-E...  Jersey, Joe Piscopo.  J-R-Z-Y.  I want everyone to follow Joe Piscopo.  It's great.  I'll tell you what.  It's been a love fest.  The comments and the folks...  Oh, my God.  And what was so cute with the younger listeners.  You see, you're a younger listeners.  I have no idea who I am.  So I come on the show.  Right, right.  And it's great.  I have a whole new audience out there.  Absolutely.  Then they start digging up Johnny Dangerously.  They dig up the SNL stuff.  And I appreciate that. 
[03:16:30]  And I come here, I have to tell you, with respect.  With respect.  Because you guys are like a monster now.  It's crazy.  You've got millions.  It's a monster.  Because I've been there since day one with the nude girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was day one.  And now, look at you guys.  You're like an empire.  The listeners, they are very dedicated.  Very sweet.  Very sweet.  We can have them praise us and give us the love we need.  Or they can turn on us like hungry pit bulls and rip our throats out.  And they know they have that juice.  So it's rough sometimes.  And the beauty is that maybe one of these gals will have a kid with you. 
[03:17:00]  You know what?  I was just thinking.  I swear.  You joke, my friend.  You joke.  But I have to tell you.  You told that story.  I have to tell you.  Listen, listen.  I've got to tell you.  If there's anybody.  I am ready, I think, to settle.  So if there's a girl.  Don't be an Anthony girl.  Don't be a big girl.  Okay.  You know, he wants to put up with the old Italian guy.  Sure.  I could probably go another round or so.  Just don't step on my toes, Joe.  Exactly.  Now, let's go out.  Let's go out.  Now you're on my farm.  Let me go out.  I'll be your wingman.  Joe and Anthony in front of a high school fist fighting. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, God.  Now that I've lost every corporate client that I've ever had on the show this morning.  Oh, my God.  Guys, thanks.  I love you guys.  I miss you guys.  Joe.  Thanks so much, man.  That was so great.  The great Joe Piscopo.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Absolutely.  I guess I have one gig to plug.  New Year's Eve in Buffalo, 28 through 31 of this month.  And then Caroline's here in New York, April 11 through 14 of my two plugs.  And we're all going to follow Joe Piscopo on Twitter.  J-R-Z-Y is how he spells it.  So it's J-R-Z-Y Joe Piscopo.
