<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts joking about their show's long-running controversial nature and complaining about a late-night Yankees playoff game impacting viewer schedules. A caller, Randy from Cincinnati, offered Red's baseball predictions and recounted a humorous T-ball coaching injury requiring shoulder surgery.  The conversation veered to the absurdity of the term "Doctober,"  a play on October referencing a pitcher's no-hitter, sparking debate about the show's shortened airtime, with Opie vehemently denying responsibility and blaming contracts. A listener's criticism prompted an angry retort from Opie.  The hosts then bantered about various sports teams and their own lack of fandom, returning to the "Doctober" joke, fueled by a Philadelphia Daily News headline.  A caller mentioned the controversial radio personality "Atom Smasher" and his negative views on women in morning radio, leading to a discussion about gender roles in the industry.  Listeners then submitted their own "tober" terms like "Brocktober" and "Socktober."

The show transitioned into promoting their "What the Hell is That?" segment, focusing on listener-submitted bizarre medical conditions for on-air doctors.  This led to an extensive, highly detailed, and humorous discussion about the possibility of Dr. Steve setting a world record for consecutive prostate exams, encompassing logistical issues, legal concerns, and the potential participant demographics.  The segment also promoted other planned bits, including the controversial "Feels for Meals" and the "55-gallon drum challenge,"  and included anecdotes about past show incidents and difficulties with obtaining approval for certain segments.  The hosts revisited the proposed prostate exam world record attempt before moving on.

The next segment included guest Joe DeRosa.  This portion featured listener calls describing unusual medical conditions, including a leaking head bump and an extra hole in the penis, eliciting graphic descriptions and humorous reactions, culminating in a studio guest vomiting.  The hosts recalled a caller's inaccurate claim about Dino Bravo's shooting and recounted a Chris Cornell encounter.  A lengthy, vulgar debate ensued about various one-hit-wonder bands (Faith No More, Kajagoogoo, etc.), fueled by personal biases.  A significant portion detailed the hosts' strained relationship with their staff, using derogatory language and descriptions of their perceived power dynamic.

A "Jocktober" segment focused on Odessa, Texas radio station B93, criticizing DJs Leo and Rebecca's on-air personalities and pre-recorded prank calls.  The hosts played a humorous clip from a Mike Schmidt retirement interview and engaged in crude commentary about photos of a naked midget who previously performed for the show.  Patrice O'Neal and Rich Voss were identified as having been in studio for that event.  Numerous tangents ensued, discussing the hosts' appearances, celebrity identities, and other radio shows.  The segment concluded with a pre-recorded interview with Edward Norton, promoting his film "Stone," interspersed with the hosts' off-color remarks.

The show's final segment discussed movies with ambiguous endings, focusing on *Fight Club*, *Taxi Driver*, *The King of Comedy*, and *Donnie Darko*.  The hosts praised Edward Norton's work, particularly *Stone*, and extensively discussed the ambiguity of *Taxi Driver*'s ending.  They also reminisced about *Rounders*, mentioning a character who was both a good friend and a total ass.  Edward Norton was a guest during this segment, promoting *Stone*.

[00:13:00]  he did not want to have a conversation the only person like looks at you and goes okay maybe it's  your time uh your turn to talk you kept trying to get a word in edgewise there and i don't know  yeah oh my god why uh carl in uh lowell massachusetts uh you know you can't just blame me for for  everything that goes wrong in your life uh oh boy you should go to 10 15 enough of the op millionaire 
[00:13:30]  crybaby bullshit no see me anthony and jim norton all signed a contract the the show now goes from  6 a.m to 10 a.m it has nothing to do with me personally so what's wrong with you so stop with  the bullshit carl okay it's the whole fucking show all right i'm sure it's a four-hour radio show that  is officially from 6 a.m to 10 a.m now what time i have not to go to uh 10 15 oh oh is that it yeah  how about whatever job you're fucking working at you stay a little later than you're supposed to 
[00:14:00]  how about you do that right for no extra money go ahead do it do it the days of me taking the blame  for everything are over this is a contract we all signed okay the only reason we went we used to go  late was because we had to because of the regular radio thing we were doing when we were on regular  radio but no one wanted to acknowledge that the haters didn't want to acknowledge that see  see see this type of radio show is a four-hour radio show yeah and if we feel like doing a little  less than four hours that's okay too all right what happened was when we went back to regular radio 
[00:14:30]  the only way uh they allowed us to do it was to make us do an extra hour of radio which was insane  at the time because they wanted exclusivity for uh from 9 to 11 right um because we were doing  regular radio from six to nine right so they were like well we don't want you to just do nine to ten  on satellite so you go to 11 and then we'll allow you to do regular radio we're like okay right and  then we don't do the regular radio gig anymore and they turned around and said well you're in your 
[00:15:00]  contract you still have to go to uh 11 right and we're like uh all right we'll be good soldiers  and then this contract comes around and we're like it's got to be the way it usually is with every  other morning show you know every fucking morning show including ours when we went when we went to  satellite six years ago right around now yeah it was a four-hour show four hours all we're doing is  going back to where we were supposed to be the the entire time every time we did a radio show when 
[00:15:30]  we were doing afternoon drive it was three to seven right when we did fucking uh morning drive it was  six to ten right and now we're just back to where we were supposed to be right and someone's  bitching go fuck your own mother's asshole see there you go carl it wasn't me douchebag i'm not  taking the blame for everything that fucking happens on this radio show simple as that okay  fuck you you know suck 15 minutes more cock than you usually do on a regular day carl i showed him 
[00:16:00]  i made it like he was giving blowjobs up for his job yeah but somehow he'll uh blame me for that  even though you just said that shove it up his e but there you go just so everyone knows it's a  four-hour radio show if we start a little after six so be it if you don't like that then lump it  then you have choices yes go pick something else to listen to and if and if enough uh of the haters  go away guess what we will have to go away because we're not as popular anymore that's what you could  do if you hate us so much go ahead start a movement start a movement a bowel movement i showed him 
[00:16:30]  again holy shit i'm on fire  we should do one of those hour radio shows you know those specialty shows where people come on  do an hour and leave yeah exactly i love those uh what a what a what a great show that would be  overall we just need uh less bitching we really do the bitching bitching is just getting ridiculous  at this point yeah just shut up howard's not even on this week again okay god damn lucky and that's 
[00:17:00]  his deal you know so that's his deal wade he got that deal you know good for him so we're doing more  radio than just about anyone else out there so shut the fuck up once talked to old howard stern over  there well the side of the building but it's my deal finders fee  yeah people really like um to bitch well they think it's it has everything to do with me it has 
[00:17:30]  nothing to do with me we're all in this together i think they think it does something too so  go fuck yourself what do you mean doesn't like they when they bitch i think they think it does  something like it actually has some kind of fucking result no it doesn't shut up no cares no cares what  you think exactly so that's the deal now you understand it we started six years ago doing a  four-hour show we went to five hours to go back to uh regular radio when that fell apart these idiots 
[00:18:00]  down the hall and they are idiots forced us to to uh continue doing four and a half to five hours a day  even though we all knew why we were doing that much radio yeah so when the contract finally ended  we finally had some kind of leverage to just bring it back to where it was to begin with a regular show  a solid four-hour radio show that way i'm not fucking bouncing off fucking uh uh i'm not bouncing  off of barriers on the expressway on the way home it's amazing the difference it makes as far as just 
[00:18:30]  being like fucking in in a zombie-like state driving home yeah and then people start bitching  when we stop the show at 10 30 it's like really yeah yeah because then that was sort of the deal  they kind of made with us they're like all right at least get to 10 10 30 and that's what we did for  them knowing the you know the whole time that we should only be doing a four-hour radio show yeah  so relax exactly relax all right where were we anthony uh we got no hitters we got the yankees 
[00:19:00]  winning yes we got uh we got october now in full effect oh that guy is so pissed right now that  just called up and said he doesn't want to hear it ever again why because we're gonna say it a lot  now october how could it be october what happens if he he gets the shit knocked out of him next time  he uh pitches october then that'll be it for october right yeah also he'll just suck i hope he i hope  he just sucks now travis is shaking his head nope not not a chance huh travis is shaking his head 
[00:19:30]  like nope not a chance he's gonna suck well he holiday doc holiday he threw two no hitters this  season did he really yeah he threw a perfect game in may he's oh that was he was the perfect game guy  wow perfect game and a no hitter all in one season that's pretty fucking impressive cover of the  philadelphia daily news right dr no dr no dr no what the back page yeah grand larceny oh no  because don larson why is it grand larceny i have no idea because don because in the end don larson 
[00:20:00]  had a better game yeah so the editor told him to to but that doesn't make sense don larson in there  it's like larson it was a grand game he pitched a grand game and and larson was the last one that did  it so it's grand larceny with the lars i have no idea i mean people will still look at don larson as  as the greatest postseason uh game pitch he didn't steal anything he pitched a perfect game 
[00:20:30]  yeah in a world series in a world series so there's no grand larceny there at all  dr kevork he can i have no idea what that means but what did our paper say what did our paper say  we have all yankees best best techs ever oh they don't even acknowledge the no hitter  yanks crank yeah yanks crank target practice oh look and then if you unfold the back of the 
[00:21:00]  newspaper you could see that there was a no hitter a grand opening yeah look you have to unfold the  advertising thing they flip up yeah and then then you see dr no no dr no no good old dr no no and uh  mr doc tover is the other do they think they were saying something like oh my god i got it  we'll call it doc tover i'm gonna be the exclusive guy that oh everyone's doing it and they see another  hundred newspapers did the exact same thing thinking they were gonna be special they were 
[00:21:30]  gonna be special uh james in kansas what's going on james oh what's up hey man  a fucking uh i got on to uh what was it facebook last night and read some of this douchebag shit on  atom smasher atom smasher it's atom atom smasher what about him i'm from that area and uh i mean i  wouldn't necessarily tell everybody that but i grew up in that area it's not a big demo at all right

[00:37:00]  bless you  we do appreciate that we're gonna do jocktober in a few minutes here but we got to start talking about  one of our benchmark bits that we're going to be doing next uh thursday or friday  i think it's uh next friday i believe dr steve is coming up from tennessee  he likes to do a new york visit dr steve his new york visit happens next uh week he'll be doing his 
[00:37:30]  weird medicine live looking forward to that and of course he's going to come in and do some radio  with us in past years he's stuck fingers up uh everyone's asses just about everyone's if you got  an ass that wants a finger in it's dr steve is there for you my he's your man he even put a finger up  uh tippy tom's ass right uh one of the last people ever to finger tippy tom's asshole he also put a 
[00:38:00]  finger up big a's ass i believe uh yeah yeah checking the prostates you know oh that's what  he's doing that's sick fuck oh really what do you think he's really doing you think it was just for  pleasure i think there's a little pleasure in that well he's going to be involved with the bit we  started i don't know 10 years ago easy we're doing what the hell is that people we love what the hell  is that we are doing what the hell is that a week from tomorrow we should have started promoting 
[00:38:30]  this a little earlier but i think we'll get enough people anyway i think we were a little  preoccupied as to whether we were even going to be here to do it oh that's a good point that's a  good point uh what the hell is that last time we did it was 2007 i think wow it's been three years  already with dr mike is dr mike coming back for this yes thumb up on that dr mike will be here all  right good old dr mike and we got dr steve and do we have a hot uh female doctor that's always good  any uh hot female doctors no dr quinn medicine woman do we have her no no that sucks one year we 
[00:39:00]  remember the one year yeah we had that i forget was she on survivor what what reality show was she  on she was a doctor she came in and she did uh what the hell is that with us checking everyone for  hernias she wasn't sticking fingers up anyone's asses no dr steve though no problem man dr steve  we should force dr steve to set a uh guinness world record oh for how many prostate exams 
[00:39:30]  how many like those gangbang videos got a bunch of people lined up yeah can we do that and just  have them can we do that oh my god if we could get a line all the way down the hall and and dr steve  is just putting his fingers in assholes all morning he'd have to rip a glove off put another glove on  wham it in rip the glove off think gangbang film how many but instead it's dr steve and his stupid  fingers going up asses that'd be fantastic we can't do this because of the uh the no insertion 
[00:40:00]  rule yeah but it's not with the no insertion rule you assholes but it's different it's a doctor  it's a doctor i think we found a loop hole again zingers are the babysitters here yet  what time do they get in even though they're supposed to be uh part of this channel we start  at six they should be here every morning at six we don't really want that why we walk all over them  anyway who gives a shit rather not look at them though i mean if mel was in studio every day at six 
[00:40:30]  your your statement would be absolutely true but these guys should be here every day at six  really for this very reason yeah we don't have to look at them but sit in your stupid office and  and just look at your computer screen until we need you yeah but you know they wouldn't do that  what they come down you gotta see their faces as they make laps the babysitters they all make laps  they they walk around the glass studio and they they take a peek in like what do you what are you  looking for i don't know personally i like what do you expect to see 
[00:41:00]  they should be available um by phone well find out if a doctor could stick his fingers up  listeners assholes all morning to try to set a uh guinness book of world records it's legitimate  prostate exams by the way i want to line people up uh sixth avenue i i want a lot stretching for miles  now outside could be a problem i want dr steve's fingers to feel like they're gonna fall off because  he's stuck them up so many assholes get dr steve on the phone i want to see if he's in on this 
[00:41:30]  and what's the record let's go we got lots to figure out here what is the record i bet that's  not in there huh i bet that's not in the guinness book no consecutive prostate exams uh fuck the no  insertion rule that is the best idea i've ever heard i want to see dr steve break the record record  god damn it yeah well where's the babysitters when we when we met one of the babysitters he said  you know what this is why uh uh uh you need me working for for you guys oh yeah i could get past 
[00:42:00]  the rules i know how to talk to these lawyers i remember that thank you yeah that was a good one  i never forgot that conversation that was a load of laughs that's when he went from someone that i  could possibly respect uh being a babysitter because guess what since that conversation he  hasn't been able to get anything past the lawyers no the lawyers are not a one bit the lawyers uh  and watch him movable he'll fail again you told us you could get shit past the lawyers we want a 
[00:42:30]  doctor it's a legitimate doctor to put his fingers in guys asses to check their prostates yeah and in  the process we want to maybe set a guinness book of world record it's uh it's a completely stupid  lawyers and and get that done immediately completely legitimate and guess what gary if you do this  i'll stop calling you a babysitter oh so there's something in it for you he'll be promoted  uh we got dr steve on the phone dr steve i'm so in you're so in oh yeah see dr steve's in 
[00:43:00]  dr steve's in uh and you you are a doctor right oh my god of course he is imagine after all these  years he finds out he's just some guy just some creep that printed something from the internet and  put it on his wall you fucking ghoul that would be great uh boy where would you find a record like 
[00:43:30]  that like to to see you know what we don't need the guinness book of world records we'll set the  record with dr steve that'll be the official record and we'll get the we'll get the info out there  i believe that would be a first how many assholes you think you get your fingers in in one  one morning in one in one morning yeah oh gosh i mean uh 10 seconds an asshole if they could do the  math it'd be pretty you know if you could just get them do a lot how many seconds in an hour danny 
[00:44:00]  seconds in an hour how many 10 seconds in an hour i guess and how many 10 seconds  it would be 360 right all right so you could do 360 guys an hour dr steve could do 360 guys an hour  wow yeah we had but we're but we're we're setting this up like the gangbang films and you know the  girls in the gangbang films they're fucking working both hands at the same time dr steve is it possible  wow now you're to put your right hand in one ass your left hand in another ass and now you're being 
[00:44:30]  silly that's crazy and then you'd need uh people with the gloves putting gloves on his hands  yeah there'd be a pile just a pile of stinky fingered gloves on the floor yeah i think this  would be great oh by the way and and thank you hold on dr steve we like we like the throwing logic at  this company and and and and in the and in the end it doesn't mean shit but at least we throw the  logic at them go ahead andrew hey guys uh uh katie cork had a pipe stuck up her ass right on national 
[00:45:00]  tv oh that's true yeah so why why can't we do uh a bit that involves insertion this would be for uh  national prostate health week or something yeah yeah it would be for proctober asshole oh proct proctober  proctober oh we're in the middle of proctober now i think uh i think we uh get this one through 
[00:45:30]  you want to talk about press for the show man we got guys lined up and and this and this guy is just  shoving fingers left and right all for the good and and everyone gets their prostate checked  is an october cancer prevention month is it i don't know i'm not let me say how to craig in  atlanta you're on with dr steve craig hey hey i'm uh steve my dr steve might appreciate this i'm a  doctor and five years ago when i came out of residency at you know to atlanta and uh my uh 
[00:46:00]  partner said hey it's a good idea go to this prostate screening and meet all the urologists  so i go and i'm a radiation oncologist so uh i go and no urologist show up and i did 73 prostate exams  in two hours 73 in two hours yeah damn nobody else showed up i don't know how many times did you come  none good answer well okay i think that that's the world record right now that is all right let's  work off 73 in two hours you think you can do more than 73 in two hours dr steve absolutely if we have 
[00:46:30]  the the line set up in an efficient way yeah yeah all right because he had to talk to him and stuff  have we talked to the babysitter yet we just need an assembly line we can't get a hold of it up is he  up we still need to check with legal is he's checking with legal i'm i guess when he gets in  that'll be his so legal's gonna say no speaking of assholes right got him again so but gary that's  not what you said when we first met with you just checking with legal now you know legal's gonna go 
[00:47:00]  no so then what is your skill set where you're gonna get this bit passed you gotta fight with  legal right is what you gotta do don't just wait for legal to tell you no then what are you going to  do we gotta fight that makes you special for our right to stick fingers up men's ass right holes  exactly wow dr steve thanks so much uh for um uh doing this if we can get it through um you are our  man that's right but you will be here for the uh what the hell is that absolutely october 15th 
[00:47:30]  october 15th what are we looking for dr steve as far as what the hell is that  uh any kind of uh bizarre anomaly anything that's uh on your skin or on your body that uh you don't  know what it is or if you know what it is and you just think that it would be that we can make fun of  it yes yeah we'll accept that too eric just gave me a disc with a bunch of what the hell is that's  from 2007 we're looking for things like this we had chris in 2007 he had a leaking bump on his head 
[00:48:00]  so he came in to find out what the hell is that a leaking bump yeah we're looking for the weird  shit remember the i don't think it's on here remember the guy when he ate hot food only half  his face sweat yeah when he ate like uh wings and he did it for us and it was right down the middle  one side of his face was completely dry and the other side was just ridiculously sweaty sweaty yes  you hear about that dr steve you know what that is uh yeah it's like horner it's not horner syndrome 
[00:48:30]  i can't remember the name of that one but great you're gonna be wonderful for this one of those  syndromes jesus some syndrome right my brain that's something you learn about in medical school and  never see so that would be all right we also had josh there i can dredge that shit up okay we also had  uh josh um he came in came in for what the hell is that his problem anthony yeah extra hole in his 
[00:49:00]  penis oh right he had one with an extra hole in his uh penis then you had doug who had a bump from  a car accident still producing glass oh glass would work its way out constantly body it was pushing the  glass is being pushed out by his body then we had rajiv with a big back scar that's peeling and grows  bigger oh and then we had this guy anthony who had a split uvula all right uvula those were some of 
[00:49:30]  the things we got back in 2007 when we did what the hell is that great so we're looking for you to  come in on uh friday next friday yeah with something that's a little strange a little weird maybe you're  just not brave enough to go to the doctor and you come in here and dr steve and a few other doctors  will will uh consult and and figure out what the hell you got going on yep love it keep  keep it fun though please one year we had a possible cancer victim well and it just creeped  everybody out but thank god because that might have saved little jimmy's life jimmy stopped smoking 
[00:50:00]  after that that's true so you know some good came out of it that that's very true all right dr steve  um are we done with dr steve we can let him go uh go to work yeah i guess uh how do how do people  get a hold of us if they want to be part of what the hell is that danny op anthony at serious xm.com  okay good anthony at serious xm.com all right let's start emailing us this is one of our benchmark  uh bits yes we love this one we're hoping for a really good turnout next week when dr steve comes 
[00:50:30]  up from tennessee yes and we're gonna work on the prostate uh world record thing dr steve all right  sounds good i'll let you know totally maybe we could just find someone's basement and do it uh  oh god off site disturbing as a web series  uh all right dr steve probably the only problem with that is my anonymity will be uh somewhat at  risk if we do something like this yeah yeah we we should keep it on the radio we'll put a halloween 
[00:51:00]  mask on you oh great crusty the clown mask why not when stalker patty was on all fours naked  stalker patty who is she i don't know she's on some other show yeah all our people go to other  shows that's good we make you famous then you go somewhere else thanks is there any fucking loyalty  in this business uh thank you dr steve we'll see you next week okay brother all right man i can't help  it because i can't get in like work at starbucks in the morning and i can come into all right shut 
[00:51:30]  up right and you know uh aaron makes a very good point why don't we just go right to aaron in indiana  aaron hey what's going on boys hey man hey um what we don't realize is with that many numbers you're  bound to find somebody that's going to have a problem down there and you're probably going to save  his life of course that's true we'll be we'll make jokes but we really want to line up just a  shitload of guys and and make dr steve just uh do prostate exams all morning long one after another 
[00:52:00]  speed prostate exams bunch of gay guys just show up just to get a little thrill  so just let just tell gary you're gonna save some lives oh whatever gary will do whatever he does  whatever that is see wouldn't that be waiting to find out what he does just think about if you put  the word out to just get guys to show up to have a finger shoved up their ass yeah to i i think like  to a gay guy that would kind of be like hey the words out uh we want sperm samples we're gonna have 
[00:52:30]  some chicks just jack you off uh show up wouldn't you show up just have some girl jerk you off yeah i  guess you would have to yeah so it's just gonna be i think a lot of gay guys going go ahead you're  not far off don't stop at the finger sir you're not far off because uh one of the things that  happened out there in radio maybe it still happens to this day when a radio station would uh promote  that they're giving away free whatever would be hot dogs donuts or whatever the fucking promotion was 
[00:53:00]  the word would get out with the homeless people oh yeah one homeless person would would go holy shit  free food monday morning with this blah blah morning show and all the homeless people would  always show up because the word got out in so you're onto something so you're gonna get uh i think a lot  of people that would enjoy having a finger put in their ass right for whatever reason sexuality fetish  sure uh rich in philly rich yo i want to call you out on your uh loyalty uh thing for uh stalker patty 
[00:53:30]  she walked on the ground and all fours naked he ripped off her wig and you're wondering why she  has no loyalty to herself all that stuff made her famous yeah and what has she done for us lately  now she just comes in and hangs out she feels like she doesn't have to do anything anymore no hasn't  even brought in uh starbucks uh yeah where's my 50 cent gift card where's my starbucks i did hear she's 
[00:54:00]  up to five hours of vacation time though really five hours after all those years time uh yeah after  all these years she has five hours of vacation ronnie was asking her where she's going  five hours wow that's nice uh what okay this is a very good question what the hell is that we're  talking about that right now it's it goes down a week from tomorrow we really want you guys to get  involved if you have something weird or strange that you just don't know what it is  uh and you're kind of scared to go to the doctor maybe it's time to get it checked out and uh next 
[00:54:30]  friday sure there'll be some jokes flying around but you also figure get uh to find out what the  hell's going on with you okay yeah maybe just ease your mind and uh chris in the bronx has something  chris hey what's going on guys how are you hey man uh you know dr steve doing all these kind of like  what aaron said you uh you find something you just push them along say okay next give them the oh  shit face or do you actually oh the oh shit face we we had the oh shit face happen i i guess you 
[00:55:00]  you you must be a newer listener but when we were doing this at anyw about 10 years ago a guy came in  with something in his mouth the doctors looked one doctor tapped out and said i don't want to be a  part of this anymore and well and we're doing sign language with the guy like what's up and he did  the big c yeah with his hands like ymca he goes i'm out and he he stopped doing the bit and then  the guy in a panicked voice maybe iraq could find that clip because that clip was intense and that's 
[00:55:30]  and that is the reason why jim norton stopped smoking yeah the guy started begging oh god please  just tell me what it is what do i need to do where can i go right now so our fun little uh bit  turned to a horror show for a few minutes i uh but uh that guy i mean we gotta let everyone off  the hook it turned out it wasn't cancer yeah yeah checked out but i know what this guy's talking  about though if you're trying to set a speed record um you don't have time to do a consultation  so i would think dr steve could do something like this like okay you're good you're good don't go 
[00:56:00]  anywhere you're good you're good right stick around right you're good you're right yeah maybe he  can bring up some literature yeah yeah just hand someone a pamphlet right here's if they have a  problem good luck to you dr steve came to a business card at the end you know you're in deep shit yeah  oh i thought you meant with the what the hell is that because uh that's the chance we are taking  that we're gonna find something that is pretty serious never know all right guys thanks a lot  sex bagel says that that dat was damaged in the flood that sucks what flood we lost some of our 
[00:56:30]  stuff in the flood what flood just a flood there was a flood yeah there was a flood and a fire  and a fire there was an attic fire where some of the tapes were destroyed really yeah and there  was also a flood that damaged some other tapes from our old days oh brother either that or some  fucking scumbag didn't want to give us all our tapes back ah because he thought it he thought they  were his let me uh say hi to nick in illinois nick that wasn't steve don't be no it wasn't steve yeah 
[00:57:00]  people will speculate steve c uh was a soldier simple as that in the end steve c was a fucking  soldier for this show a dead soldier now uh nick what's going on he's in arlington guys hey man  opi i want to question your wisdom in using the words i want a shitload of guys to come down here  ah true you know i think i said that perfectly because uh everyone knows my hatred for dr steve so 
[00:57:30]  why make it fun for him so you want guys loaded with shit right shitload of guys so he has to stick  the finger in and so he's a little messy yeah so he has to put all his talents i want you to use all  your talents and skills because he's really gonna have to rip the gloves off quick and put them on  who doesn't want to see like oh you'd have to like a speed round of and then the ky like he's got a  fucking ky yeah maybe he could have got to get that down a big tub of ky where he's just oh god 
[00:58:00]  just sticking the fingers in real fast it's disgusting i think it's time we start doing  bits again ant yeah might as well right been on satellite for six years i think it's time to do  bits again give it a whirl why not instead of this horse shit where we just make it up every day  see i told you i've been saying for years  uh only people need to show up without some uh maybe next year 
[00:58:30]  well maybe next year you could get girls in for breast cancer month that would be nice  yeah well that's our famous feels for meals program that uh we've been trying for a decade to get off  no insertion there though you think this is the year we could do feels for meals i'm feeling this  is the year that we finally get to do feels for meals around christmas time it it sells itself  it's brilliant feels for meals uh that was approved maybe i do believe that was approved 
[00:59:00]  yeah but what are the rules some of our bits have been approved yeah so i'll be honest but then  the way we have to do the bit we can't do the bit it's it's so ridiculous yeah you know like  homeless shopping spree where there's dope down the hall goes well good news guys we could do  homeless shopping spree okay what does that entail well we're gonna go to all the malls and and see  if uh we could get permission to go to their mall and they have and i looked the guy right in the face 
[00:59:30]  and i said that is never going to happen so this is not good news he goes why don't you have an open  mind for once he gets all uptight i go no i'm not gonna have an open mind because i know  more than you and this is going to be a huge fail the worst and in the end by the way it was a huge  the worst part was that they wanted to go to the malls and have the malls sign a contract that said  no matter what happened that sirius xm would not be held responsible like a homeless guy could pull  out a knife and just start stabbing people and uh they wanted you know no part of it as far as 
[01:00:00]  responsibility goes look man the malls were like no we're not signing something like this and they  don't even uh look at the fact that we did the homeless shopping spree for i don't know three  or four of them easily with not one incident yeah we got a bunch of listeners they would be there  spending money homeless people getting stuff they needed i would love to do bits again i really would  that's that's one thing this show is uh missing but it's almost impossible with these idiots down 
[01:00:30]  the hall 55 gallon drum challenge was a biggie oh really want to try to get that done yeah right  we're gonna want to try to get that done lock young girls and fucking 55 gallon drums and pour  shit all over them remember the chick that had to go to the hospital because she got a cricket in her  ear and couldn't get it out and we horrified the building when they wheeled her out and she was all  bloody but that was just blood from other things it wasn't her blood yeah yeah but no one knew that  oh my god right yeah can you imagine letting us bring thousands of crickets into the building 
[01:01:00]  remember we heard crickets for months afterwards months after there was if we'd be doing the show  danny i'm not even joking it wasn't even when a joke bombed it was always yeah also we would hear  them we couldn't find them it's like what the fuck and then someone told me when they finally ripped  up that place they found dead crickets everywhere yeah like when they ripped up the rugs and stuff  because we would just dump them in they were jumping around and oh yeah they were all over the  fucking place we didn't imagine telling the guys down the hall we're gonna do that really yeah we're 
[01:01:30]  gonna do that oh really bring in live eels and oh really and and the whole place is gonna stink  and then we would just leave yeah and make the building clean it up clean it up there was dead  shit everywhere after that bit yeah that was great feels for meals though might be a possibility big  refrigerator box for the people that don't know we do have newer listeners so we get some women they  volunteer every time we bring this bit up they come in they're topless in the in the box there's a 
[01:02:00]  couple holes in the front of the box so uh so uh guys and and believe it or not some some ladies  want to do this as well they bring some canned food or some kind of money that we donate to the  homeless actually doing something nice around the holiday and you because you brought in a can of  beets or something you you reach your hands into the two little holes in the front of the box and  give a nice little feel you give a little tweakage little squeeze little squeeze and then feels meals  and then you move on yeah and we have a truck and we're loading it up with canned goods isn't that 
[01:02:30]  harmless of course like like it's it's fucking harmless of course it is i think the bit that they  actually did approve uh i think we were going to do like a thing over with uh steven singer where we  would we would get a a bunch of women and uh in boxes just like feels for meals and then have a guy  feel and try to find his partner and i do believe that they approve that so i think who came up with  that but that doesn't well we needed to augment it for for the stop augmenting our bits and just do 
[01:03:00]  our bits well the point is it's the same thing pretty much and it'll it got approved so yeah that  gets approved so if we want to do it for homeless people getting food then there's a problem we need  a sponsor involved why would there be a problem if we if we get a charity involved and uh and and  we're collecting you know canned goods all day and i'm not saying i'm saying it probably won't be  i think the cash donations meant it was prostitution or something oh was that the issue that was that 
[01:03:30]  was some dumb lawyer's logic on the whole thing but it isn't i mean it isn't you think about it it's  just fucking boobs like an adult kissing booth what's the difference yeah exactly kissing booth  exactly it's pretty disgusting when you think about it you're pretty much kissing every other  guy by proxy i want to get a nice big swamp lip happening and i'm gonna do a kissing booth bit  that doesn't happen anyway when you meet a girl yeah i know how much cum has been on those lips 
[01:04:00]  yeah but it's not like she just fucking did it like a kissing booth is she's kissing a guy  got his enough bit so if enough time goes by it's not gay anymore yeah yeah there is a time and  washing fact it's like it's like when something like when food drops on the floor yeah five second  rule five second rule you got five second rule for come on lips and i'm working on the dr steve  world record prostate exam thing and uh i don't think we're done yet charlie in georgia charlie charlie 
[01:04:30]  hey what's up boys what's up oh i'm just thinking all the creeps uh that listen to the show  could show up in drag you can see dr steve a legitimate physician that went to school for  this um i have to stick his finger at the asp a guy wearing the indian outfit for the um for the  village people i'm gonna take your idea i'm gonna work with it a little bit dr steve wouldn't care  halloween's right around the corner maybe everyone has to come in in a halloween costume in a halloween  costume costume costume all right boys punch it out all right so where are we at the uh the lawyers 
[01:05:00]  are going to decide another bit for the opian anthony show that's great yeah yeah so why are we even  talking let the lawyers decide but then the guy says he knows how to work around the lawyers what  will he do then when they say no we'll see all right we'll see stay tuned on the line you lose  the title babysitter if you could get this done babies that's all they are they know it i just like 
[01:05:30]  i said i like when they're kind of out of sight out of mind well it's my favorite oh i got a lot to  say about that but maybe i should shut the fuck up oh that's a good idea babysitter he can be promoted  to substitute teacher substitute from babysitter to substitute teacher no i'll give him the title  of nanny nanny nanny au pair au pair you'll become an au pair you'll be an au pair yeah  because a babysitter you're like here's your money get lost but a nanny or an au pair there's a little 
[01:06:00]  more more acknowledgement yeah then you might be a human being yeah you kind of really get to be  known by the family and right taken in a little more all right willing to donate his ass for  oh this guy's willing to donate his ass for uh the dr steve bit yes sir  thank you wow yeah this is gonna be a great bit

[01:14:30]  press yes chris come out a date line hollywood who is chatting it up with chris cornell in the  swimming pool oh god you guys look like you could be brothers i know it's like people are saying that  like two but one in great shape and one in horrible shape yeah you look like the you look like the  brother where where he goes what am i gonna do he's my brother i gotta i gotta help the guy out  what's that tattoo on his arm say it's the k something k we're on his shoulder yeah did you get 
[01:15:00]  a look at that nah i wasn't really looking at that although that's how i did confirm it was indeed chris  cornell because i was like i've seen him so many times like even here we've had him on the show but i  didn't want to be like that guy looks like chris cornell so i just made sure it was him by the  cat does he even know who we are yeah yeah he does he no i mean i'm seriously yeah because some  people when you go hey opie from the opie anthony show they give you that oh yeah but you know they're  just like faking it no he knew he does know yeah because he brought up shit from when he was on the 
[01:15:30]  show okay yeah because we're huge fans obviously i know the guy's fucking great love uh love uh the guy  the tattoo is a ck okay but i don't know what the k that's not his initial no no no see right say  yeah is soundgarden gonna put out new songs i think it's his kids or something maybe  is soundgarden gonna put out new songs uh yeah oh yeah that's what i heard they are that's what  he told me it's about time one of these reunion bands started putting out new shit too yeah i don't 
[01:16:00]  know oh by the way speaking of reunions faith no more when you were fucking dude i got an email from a fan  of the show that uh holy shit dude i laughed so fucking hard out loud and he was he goes never  listen to never talk music with opie faith no more one hit wonder that guy used to play music  and he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about and then it goes i once heard him say 
[01:16:30]  queens reich was a pink floyd ripoff i love my thoughts on music i'm not saying they're accurate  dude i literally laughed out loud come on faith the war is a one hit wonder band there's i was  thinking the only people that don't agree with that are the fucking hardcore fans i was thinking about  this as far as mainstream success goes i i you couldn't name a second song for me but right here's  the thing right said fred was a one hit wonder band i would argue that i'm too sexy they had two 
[01:17:00]  songs they were also a pink floyd ripoff did i really say queens right because i read it on my  phone i literally laughed out loud i emailed the guy back and i go jesus christ dude like i did he  really say that and then he wrote back he goes yeah because you know how much queens right sounds like  pink floyd it's a it's a fair point dude it was fun um you sure it wasn't dream theater or what  now i need to know other dumb things i say when i talk about music because that one's great 
[01:17:30]  ah queens right wow i don't know if i said that it sounds like something i would have said that's  so inaccurate it's an insult to queens right  that rule yeah now here's the i was thinking about this though um there's a difference between a  one hit wonder somebody that hits gets they get one hit and they're done there's different between 
[01:18:00]  that and a band that is successful and then has that one song that really cracks mainstream success  those are two very different around still touring and still selling out places yeah yeah you know  what i mean that's true like kajagugu with too shy that was a one hit wonder yeah yeah yeah is that  who's that kajagugu that's that's the go-to one hit wonder man go to one hit wonder yeah that's it  biggest one hit wonders ever that is a big one of the biggest one yeah the other one is um 
[01:18:30]  aha take on me but they're huge in england dude yeah but that doesn't count that's still one  hit wonder here who acknowledges england when you live in america you're right well like like  what i'm talking about is like is like people say like bismarkey is a one hit wonder yeah just a  friend but it's like that dude was like iconic in rap music that's all we're asking name another  song that we all know well he's got other hits that aren't as big as that though that's him and  motherfucking too short but that's the definition of one hit don't you start knocking too short 
[01:19:00]  around too short motherfucker i love too short you guys saw bismarkey and too short in uh toronto  once they were just were you in a cabana in a pool yeah i was in a cabana and uh he was  doing cannonballs into the pool that's how you meet all your celebrity musicians in a pool somewhere  what would be he's not allowed  this pool is restricted bismarkey what would be the second song for faith no more that's how you  play the one hit wonder game you got to get out of uh go ahead sorry no yeah midlife crisis midlife 
[01:19:30]  crisis was pretty big but dude uh their cover easy by the commodores was all right that was a good  song absolutely dude falling to pieces was another big hit all right that was a good song you know what  i'm gonna say it to your face faith no more not a one hit wonder band let's move on  i can't argue that thank you i can't argue that not a pink floyd ripoff i don't know about  that people are saying silent lucidity did sound a little floyd thank you can we hear silent lucidity 
[01:20:00]  i want to hear this was a great cover by the way oh it's awesome i forgot about this yeah i'll be  honest with you there they they you know they made their their mark they set the mark yeah you know  what the am i trying to say i don't even know watermark some kind of mark benchmark yeah benchmark  there is some type of marky mark bismarck bismarck more importantly uh right said fred was there  another song by those guys they had a follow-up but it was nothing it didn't even come close  no what was it what was it called i don't know like i'm too sexy for something it was sexy for 
[01:20:30]  my shoes it was i like when the band tries to do their follow-up hit and it's the hit kind of  sideways yeah it's like the hit yeah it was called i was called i'm too rapey and it didn't do it  i have a couple other right side fred songs in the system oh please yes travis yeah the one was  let's twist again that is a big one the twist and then uh who did the twist they covered the twist  no no i mean the original what was that chubby checker yeah he did the twist then the fat boys 
[01:21:00]  remade it remember and then he did let's twist again was his like big fucking big follow-up hit  are you serious yeah and it was the same as the twist i still know you were twisting  and then it just became like come on i need some money let's twist hey joe uh douche nozzle thank  you war pigs faith no more they did a version yeah they did cover that you like that too yeah it's  all right i mean i i love the war pigs it's yeah it's it's they do the cover justice i just you know 
[01:21:30]  i i just prefer their original stuff versus the covers but yeah it's good this was the follow-up  hit by right said fred see you're right yeah it's their hit sideways almost sounds like too sexy for  my shirt too sexy for my shirt this song should be called gay men you will catch aids to this  yeah how many guys cut aids to this oh god is this song responsible for a lot of aids cases 
[01:22:00]  this should so be played when dr steve is doing anal rectal exams on on other people yes how many  times is this song playing and a guy just did this to another guy getting the old head nod like hey  let's go this way come on i got a room and we're developing our bit perfectly yes nothing but right  said fred songs as dr steve shoving fingers up guys asses we're trying to set the record most prostate  exams in one morning could you see this part of the nowhere insertion thing yeah wow all right but 
[01:22:30]  it's a doctor so so it's yeah i got you could you imagine a bunch of naked men bent over with dr steve  just shoving his finger in their asses to this song look it's your idea oh it's hot it's your idea but  can we expand it to just a uh a catalog of really gay songs oh yeah yeah yeah all right good  good good we should definitely have a little uh freddie mercury maybe what's like later queen 
[01:23:00]  yeah they did after he died what's oh my god i don't give a shit if everyone knows i'm gay now  music oh yeah yeah what's dr steve's twitter because i think the listeners should suggesting  gay songs to dr steve to get his approval i don't have it in front of me what's dr steve's twitter  uh i'm not sure i have i have a suggestion a queen one play don't stop me now by weird medicine  start tweeting weird medicine and suggest your gay songs for the big prostate show that dr steve's 
[01:23:30]  doing for us because we want his approval on the the music choices yeah play don't stop me now while  he's figuring assholes trust me yeah oh dude trust me trust me it literally sounds like a guy would  be leaping through the room wearing leotards listen you gotta let it kick in though it starts yeah  that's really really really you know what kicked in with him oh boy oh hence no more hits

[01:29:30]  tin doing construction knocking tin oh and and we went to a justice of the peace in northport  and then went back to my house for a party in the backyard complete with like a fucking tarp  over the fucking oh it was just white trash it was so bad oh that is gleaming white trash it was  lily white it was horrible oh my god man that sounds terrible just like and and the whole thing 
[01:30:00]  was and and on the way back from the justice of the peace i made sure because i think it was either  the belmont or the preakness or something we had to stop at otb so i could place a bet oh christ  jesus christ and there's bride and groom in in the uh in the otb oh let's place a bet oh my god  that's hard i should have bet on how long the marriage would last i'll do you i wish they would  have taken that fucking bet i'll do you what here uh my cousin got married and the the uh what's that 
[01:30:30]  called the table the long table where the bridal party sits the dais is it called the dais i think  it's a roast yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that that long table they were doing the eagles chant during the  wedding reception they were going e-a-g-l-e-s eagle they kept doing that over and over they were  wasted and uh that's my my dad's a deacon so he he doesn't have anything bad to say about anybody ever 
[01:31:00]  and i i went i went into the bathroom and he was in there and i go hey dad how you doing i go how  you enjoy the wedding and he just goes ah man you could just see and he was like what's going on i  can't say it i i oh man oh shit i hope i i you know what i hope my cousins hear this and they're  all scrambling to figure out which cousin i'm talking about right now i i i had to do my uh white trash 
[01:31:30]  wedding twice also what because uh yeah once was just like barely anyone there just witnesses get  married and then a party in the backyard with friends and shit like that but then uh uh like  my parents and relatives and stuff were like oh my god we didn't get a chance to see this or that  it was like all right then it's got to be done again so it was at the bar my mother worked at she 
[01:32:00]  tended bar there which later a few years later became a strip club down there christ where vets  highway and jericho split off where our tax guy was yeah yeah jesus same place and and it was just  again white trash revisited yeah white trash number two you didn't have to say that part yes i know  like i'm telling you some news there yeah with the jukebox playing like betty davis eyes during the you  know oh my god oh it was it was it was awful now was there any part of you during that where you 
[01:32:30]  thought i am white trash or were you fully in it like no every part of it i knew i was like this is  trash and i'm like what am i doing why am i even here doing this this is terrible it was one big  embarrassment the entire marriage was an embarrassment how long were you married for oh oh my god nine  years oh did you hear that joe how he talks about you would assume wow i made a mistake and and he's  one of those guys gets divorced two months later no he said nine years nine years he was in it for nine 
[01:33:00]  years i get it though because the worst the worse it gets to the digger you deep in or yeah yeah  the deeper you dig in i know the deeper you dig in why why is it that so many people including myself  we do that not with my marriage by the way but with relationships where you know it's wrong you  know it's going nowhere and then it takes years to get the fuck out of it why do we do this i don't  know do women do this too or is it a guy's thing no i think everybody have you been in one of those 
[01:33:30]  relationships where you knew fuck this isn't for me and then next thing you know years go by and you're  like what the fuck am i doing i'll tell you something dude i i dated a girl when i i lived in texas the  year my first year out of college i lived in texas for a year and dude i was lonely i didn't really  know anybody i went down there to work and it sucked my job was really demanding and crazy and  i didn't really like the people i worked with that much and i had three friends that only wanted to  hang out on saturday night that's the only time so i had six days a week to just be with myself 
[01:34:00]  and be miserable and i finally meet this chick  and i start dating her and she turns out to be shithouse  fucking crazy dude like the craziest chick i've ever really ever did i've never ever known girls  that were like that no some of them are crazy you didn't know that holy fuck dude every one of them  are batshit yeah it's just which ones are more crazy i know let's let's just get out in the open 
[01:34:30]  you're all a bunch of cunts so what happened with this girl though you knew she was crazy but you're  like you know what but i am lonely yeah yeah no well see here's the thing when i i liked her from  from afar for a while and so when i finally hooked up with her i was excited like holy  shit i landed this chick and we started dating and i quickly realized like she's nuts but you're so  lonely and you're so alone and you're like i gotta fix this because i can't fucking handle 
[01:35:00]  the emotional overhaul of this bitch being crazy right now if i dump her and it's not i can't deal  with it so you just keep going through it going i'll fix it i'll fix it i'll fix it and then next  thing you know you're in fucking way deep you can't get out she's more bad shit than she was  and it's that's i think that's what people do you keep going i had a thing with a girl recently where  we we we she was over my place and we had sex we're not really dating but we had sex and uh  we got into a fight after the sex what about something and she was like this is it i gotta go and i'm 
[01:35:30]  like no no no don't go don't because you're just going no if you just hang out this will pass we'll  get through it and that's the way i think that's what people do they think wow yeah rectify it you  can't rectify it it's fucked but you're lonely there's just been circumstances where it's like uh  oh uh oh this one's crazy holy shit yeah bad shit crazy yeah and we're we're all self-destructive 
[01:36:00]  you know yeah i've that's never been insulted more than when i come into the studio half the time  i still run back here we all do we've been nothing but nice to you i'm kidding i'm joking you want us  to fuck with you i'm joking so much i'll do that i've been taking acting classes good right that was  good are you really taking classes i'm doing all sorts of shit that was good you got me when we thank you  joe yeah of course when when the girl like starts acting crazy and shit and you realize like uh you 
[01:36:30]  got to start thinking to yourself like if if i wasn't having sex with this girl would i listen to  a fucking word she was saying or even carry on a conversation past hello in an elevator or or anything  and usually the answer is no but can you keep fucking them if you don't want to see i can't i if i  fuck them once and the second i come i'm thinking shut up i don't i can't fuck them anymore right 
[01:37:00]  i never do it again do you keep doing it that's a problem well what does their body look like  you know dude you know it's all proportional to girls like like danny body oh hot ones  i'm a very nice ass joe people have commented on uh then he's got a bubble a bubble ass  danny's almost got midget uh guy ass he's not a midget though is he  fucking ron i gotta quote ronnie again ronnie said something he's talking about midgets and he 
[01:37:30]  goes one thing about them midget broads though they all got nice asses how do they pull that  off oh it's like they got that midget it's the worst ass ever i know it's a pumpkin ass it is a  pumpkin ass that's perfect a pumpkin ass oh it's awful they're horrible midget ass yeah when they  shit they have to pull the stem they take the top off of it oh that's gruesome i'm convinced that  midgets have tails yeah prove me wrong they remove them at uh birth i don't know have you seen a naked 
[01:38:00]  midget yeah i've never seen one naked i don't really see not really you don't really see naked  midgets we've seen one i think that's because she started crying that'll expose the tail oh yeah  we did make a naked midget cry jesus she wanted to be a uh stripper and she was talking about like  i would be a stripper we're like all right come on down you could audition in front of us we'll  wear the demo you know wasn't vince neal or somebody in that no it was uh colin um quinn no no no uh

[01:49:30]  you promoting today sir i would like to plug my cd that is out on comedy central records it's called  the depression auction please go buy it i'm proud of it very good yeah i gotta check that out it's uh  22 minutes of uh 22 minutes good that's like an hour long you know it's recorded vinnie brands the 
[01:50:00]  stress factory in new jersey ah yes vinnie we had a fun time out there it's been out for a few months  i i hear it's doing all right so uh please go buy one you guys make money off those cds uh yeah i've  been making some good money on the road we have it you only get your uh itunes how much you get per  unit yeah i get like well i'm going somewhere because me and aunt uh made one cd that was  extremely successful and decided to never do it again yeah yeah why wouldn't you guys do cds and 
[01:50:30]  we got raped on the first one pretty good well because we had a share of 75 cents per disc  oh that's nothing dude that's the deal of a lifetime that's good that's amazing  that's that's what we're supposed to get but then he held back money and uh it was just a nightmare  i mean in the end we maybe made ten thousand dollars each maybe and this thing sold hundreds  of thousands of copies standard i think i mean look you guys are obviously at a different level  than most of us but like standard standard unit prices are like a few bucks a disc yeah to the 
[01:51:00]  label that's what's tough about itunes because itunes takes a chunk yep well it depends like on  the road i sell it at different prices depending on where i am yeah see we should have done that  you know done the whole operation ourselves so i mean i was in canada they were selling for  twenty dollars a pop in canada so i was making you were yeah and you're making the 20 yeah i was  making a lot in canada but canada's you know it's different it's different than here you can't do  that here you know so all right places here you got to sell it for ten yeah we're done talking about 
[01:51:30]  it thanks joe uh sam just wanted a quick fucking thought jesus let me explain more the let's get into  the markets and what how it affects price unit price hang in there joe we're not going after you  today thank you everyone's fine everyone's fine of course you're having fun it's like anthony going  out with uh his uh his ex-wife everything's okay we have no problems here joe okay it's like panicking 
[01:52:00]  i love it we're not gonna be falling to pieces huh huh oh uh sam yeah sam hi i want to ask you  before we go into jocktober black or white the babysitters the babysitters had quite the beating  today yeah i mean i know because i took one yesterday yeah but for some reason you could take  a beating and those guys can't and then maybe later today i'll have to deal with some dumb email or phone 
[01:52:30]  call like you know would you have been happy if i had emailed you like hey no because i knew in the  end you could take a beating those guys can't for some reason then why are you working for our channel  don't they just get it no no work first cinemagic cinemagic yeah i'm sure that those djs aren't  beating anyone up no i wouldn't think so so take us through what happened today well what with those  guys when you were beating them up yeah what's your thoughts on the whole thing i mean i was listening and  it was not pretty i mean because it started with you just saying babysitters and that's sort of 
[01:53:00]  mundane enough that they could not mundane but non-specific enough that they could just say oh i  don't know who he was talking about and go about their days but then you guys started mentioning names  like directly saying who you were referring to babysitters yeah and that hurts yeah and then you  specifically brought up parts of their skill set that they were lacking like before you just said 
[01:53:30]  they lacked the skill set and now you're actually bringing up specific skills are you saying no one  wants to hear they're lacking a skill set not only that skill set but you're specifically saying i am  better than you are at this at everything and they're saying well that's my job well i mean i'm  trying and you're saying don't try i'm better than you leave me alone right then you say you now you  should be in at six so it's like that's the type of thing that if their boss hears he'll say why 
[01:54:00]  aren't you coming in earlier and now you're logically that makes sense oh see i know ant doesn't want  that i get it i get why he doesn't and that's enough if you're running the channel and that is big  quotes by the way that that is the biggest quote you'll ever see ever that's hurtful then you should  be here when the channel goes live and when you first brought that up ant said that he would rather  out of sight out of mind just let let us do our thing and you'll do your thing and opie you responded 
[01:54:30]  by saying what difference does it make we walk all over them anyway which is i mean they probably don't  want to hear that right because like that when they're trying to find the motivation to try to convince  you guys to do something and then they literally hear you say my honest opinion of you is that i  walk all over you and that you don't have the skill set to even have the audacity to speak to me  sort of makes them question a lot and it doesn't make them look good in front of their bosses for  sure and what's the other thing that bums them out when they realize we've uh well we're gone i mean 
[01:55:00]  they're one yeah and what i mean by ten oh one by ten oh one we're on the sidewalk right because  you know you don't give a lot of warnings sometimes that you're leaving and so  they'll realize wait a minute the show's over yeah and start walking up the hall to talk to you  and you have to tell them they're opie and anthony have already left the building is there a sadness  they're discouraged because they're trying to get some business done and it's not it's not around and 
[01:55:30]  go back to their offices because you they know you're not going to answer they can't call you oh no  they don't even have my number right and you wouldn't give it to them no my mom doesn't have  my number and they don't and well that's that's a short list of people that don't have my short list  yeah it's just them and your mom yeah that's not cool yeah as an unimportant people in my life  that's mean that's more stuff and they also know you wouldn't respond to emails if they tried to email  you no i changed my email a long time ago and they're sending they're sending emails to an old 
[01:56:00]  fucking email just a junk email address pretty much do you check it or no oh why would i i guess  so yeah see these are hurtful things for a person to hear well well prove me wrong i mean i where are  we at with the prostate thing i don't know where dr c comes in and is going to do a speed round  prostate exam thing trying to set a world record where are we at with that i mean it sounds like a  good idea to me doesn't it yes well they they've been at work 40 minutes i mean do they have an 
[01:56:30]  answer yet oh boy we'll see not only i gave too much credit that that means they got here at eight  o'clock today gee thanks they also have to wait for the powers that be to get in the lawyers have to  get here and so they're stuck kind of between a rock and a hard place because the lawyers  are saying why are you coming to me with these ridiculous requests and you guys are saying i don't  want to hear those answers from you my favorite part is like when we beat them up and then all  of a sudden like it might happen tomorrow actually if if if i know this one of them will be here 
[01:57:00]  tomorrow at six and then have to show show me they're here uh-huh all bright-eyed that's why i  don't know but the funny part about it is then they go back to not showing up and my my thought to  them would be because they want approval like look see i'm here yeah and my i would say to them  we'll now do that again tomorrow this is i mean get a few days in a row but then you show up when  we're here and then i will acknowledge wow you're actually doing the right thing i'm going on record 
[01:57:30]  saying if you do show up at six or whatever um just speak with opie because i uh i'm not i mean  generally these things are hard to hear you're really breaking down exactly you guys don't have to deal  with them at 6 a.m oh okay we'll see what i mean that was written not by me what by somebody  not by me i didn't write it me but you are you saying that that i enjoy the people are you saying 
[01:58:00]  that because we beat up the babysitters that you feel their wrath after we're gone at 10 a.m well i  don't call them babysitters i call you guys uh bosses myself and uh even boss say people i look for  to for guidance in this business these babysitters sound very unsavory yeah  and you break down like exactly what they're doing by coming in and their motivations and it's just  normally they live in a world where conversation is polite and sort of cordial oh yeah well they live in 
[01:58:30]  the wrong world i mean this is generally radio that's the fake world yeah this is certainly an honest  place but a lot of it is also toxic what well that's why we leave at 10 so we don't like so  we don't infect their world so we don't infect this place too bad that's why i think it's very healthy  for us to get the fuck out of here right at 10 every day sam but you do spend some time in the  morning hours making the rest of their day like they're not going to have a happy day today it is  astounding when that uh red second hand from 59 seconds to 60 seconds uh when it's 10 o'clock right 
[01:59:00]  how quickly that door flings open and we deploy people do get knocked over yes yeah literally knocked  over and everyone knows to stand like to the side of the hallways it's like gangway gangway like the  fire brigade the submarine the last the last time i was here you were you had your bags packed  oh yeah it was like a fucking relay race oh exactly everything's packed up beforehand oh yeah so you can 
[01:59:30]  run oh and be in bed but i think right away oh please right away i am sleeping in my bed before you  guys are back in the office yeah yeah yeah and and this is a healthy thing because if we're here too  long oh yeah it's gonna just poison oh it's only good for the show absolutely believe me because  that's all we that's our prime directive here it's a horse shit that happens when these mics are off  yeah mind-boggling because so we would rather make sure we get the 
[02:00:00]  out of this poison environment as fast as possible and you say we're in a bubble right now this bubble's  nice this is a nice environment but soon as these mics go off it's an ugly scene around here so why  would we stay around here at 10 you also say that like you fulfilled your obligation when you leave  at 10 you say we're obligated to be here from 6 to 10 right which is accurate and and certainly i  respect that are you questioning that not at all okay good but those guys might say they're used to  hearing like oh we're here you know for the show let's do something creative let's have some they 
[02:00:30]  don't like hearing like this is the end of our obligation we're done with you you are nothing but  an obligation to an obligation we're contracted to talk to you we have no personal relationships  wow that's breaking it down it's like alimony with an ex-wife exactly yeah i'm obligated  and sam um i'm gonna give these guys the chance to turn down their radios right now  not the listeners but them yeah because now if they're still listening they're just stupid 
[02:01:00]  the reason they might not have a reason for what you just said they don't have a creative bone in  their bodies ouch okay see that's hurtful because they've been in the business for a while and they  trying to come to the table with stuff and name one idea they came to the table with i don't even know  if they've ever come to the table with an idea hey let me just tell you something oh yes um i am  all for you guys sleeping in late that's all i'm gonna say we're from we're from two schools of 
[02:01:30]  thought it's nervous i'm all for you guys snooze hit the snooze all morning long well rested you like  them well i'm just i like them well rested you're right i'm just thinking if we got guys that are  thinking about the channel 24 7 anthony that our jobs become easier and unfortunately yeah but that's  not happening certain guys think in 24 7 are fine i understand that them not so much oh i know oh i  know yeah yeah yeah yeah well the ultimate goal is to get them to get them replaced so god see 
[02:02:00]  that's horrible with people that might get what we do and what the channel is all about that's a  horrible thing that's not that's not nice are you uncomfortable it also it comes across as you want  them to get in at 6 a.m not so much because it'd be good for the show but because you just want  them to get up earlier yeah and it'd be more painful for them yeah is that him  danny is a prick no danny that's very funny generally speaking he just punched up a picture 
[02:02:30]  that looked like something our thought is if we're going to suffer they might as well suffer  i'm not saying that you know again i mean i hope that doing the show is not suffering  make you suffer so see now they're gonna have to talk about that on the on the fake fan sites we're  not suffering we enjoy what we do we just don't we just don't enjoy all the other bullshit  at least staff will have something to talk about that goes with doing a fine show like this what at  least the staff will have something to talk about after the show we'll probably have a nice like 
[02:03:00]  meeting oh you'll probably get a good meeting will there be a lot of eye contact no not a lot of eye  contact but we'll probably a lot of glancing out the windows throw around some what can we do to  problem solve type of uh exercises more corporate bullshit uh it's not my opinion but thanks joe thanks for  showing up today we appreciate it dude i i i'm not trying to it's inside stuff yeah i don't know  what you guys are talking i don't want to speak out of turn what's wrong with you you're all right  yeah i was just thanking you for coming in it had nothing to do with what we were just talking

[02:34:00]  the punchline in in anyone detail that's right very good because that's how comedy works yeah yeah  i mean you think of a joke you want to make sure people we'll pull these pants up to our chain if we  have to now oh man you don't need no gun at us the crazy thing is that you know that he just pulled  the gun out but he actually shot him in the butt oh yeah i mean he had to prove a point right there  he was serious about them pulling up the britches thank you now but see he was aiming for the butt 
[02:34:30]  but because they were sagging he really shot them in the cankles oh you see what i'm saying because  the pants were sagging and he thought he shot him in the butt but because the pants are sagging that  really wasn't his butt it was more towards his leg area i love it i'm just saying leo all i know is you  better not go anywhere near i'm telling you dang you get shot too i guess he'd had enough of pants  on the ground i'm just saying that's a crazy story it is crazy it's true that's what's scary  thankfully the kid's okay can i start i know everyone wants in when you have to say

[02:46:00]  no it's carmen's calls joe i think it gets even worse no oh come on i think it even gets worse  what do they rape somebody on the air  and i think that kind of show i think it gets worse than what we've heard uh let me go to mike  in new york mike mike hey what's up listen that's the same exact thing that they play in new york and  everywhere else in the country so it's a syndicated bit yeah they play that whole carmen thing all over 
[02:46:30]  they played on hot 97 in new york are you shitting me so it's not even an original bit by these guys  it's a it's a bad bit that they stole from somebody else which would make sense why in the beginning  there's the recorded thing of carmen saying hey it's carmen for b93 and this is my call  because carmen records that and sends it to every right  so someone thought not only is it a good bit it has to be played everywhere  and people i've done those before though i've been hired to do those before where you go in 
[02:47:00]  the studio you do a fake prank call and then they just they farm it out yeah what's fake i don't  understand they'll they have somebody like sitting in the other room on a phone what  see what happens why are you spoiling radio for everybody we want to believe man what's wrong  what happens is they call a furniture store they will for example take you and put you into another  room and i will call you on the phone and they will record me with a microphone but you over the  phone then it sounds like it's a real prank call but it's not but that's not a you mean there's  a furniture store next door there's no furniture source there's no furniture i'm sorry buddy but 
[02:47:30]  the beeps we uh we're gonna have to break within like three or four minutes because we got to get  set up for our big ed norton uh interview edward norton right that's bigger than jock tober it's  huge dude he's got a movie called stone that's out friday it looks like it's gonna be a good movie  and he is coming in to promote it today that's awesome so we have one more clip from leo and rebecca  out of odessa texas their b-93 blazing hip-hop and rb radio station leo and rebecca talk about  the white house adding solar panels guess who uses prep burger see prep burger is a service that 
[02:48:00]  most of these morning shows they're not good enough to even come up with their own bits so  they actually have to buy bits from other places i guess that's where they got carmen's calls from  is uh prep burger but it's like a pre-recorded bit that they yeah they buy they buy they're funny  they actually buy they're funny i got you like for instance a parody song uh oh and now they're  going to actually uh install rooftop solar panels really yes the obama administration announced tuesday  that the white house will have solar panels to generate electricity 
[02:48:30]  and a solar water heater atop the living quarters by spring 2011 i like this but uh president obama was  not the first to do it but why why back in 1979 jimmy carter uh actually had them as well way back in  the day but why was it removed or whatever you shut up hole and let him push the button to start the  dumb bit she's trying to set it up really stop maybe because it was an ancient fucking technology 
[02:49:00]  shut the fuck up removed or whatever they're removed uh during the reagan administration uh  because of solar energy maintenance on the ground something with the maintenance of them  and they eventually just pulled down okay just pulled down very concise i think this is very  cool very interesting because i'm just happy to know that the obamas now will have hot water in  their water heater because of the solar panels true that sasha and malia i love it i love it way to go yeah 
[02:49:30]  why is that i love it this is a parody a solar powered lights oh  house  they're not doing i swear to god i just got douche chills i just got legitimately got chills  how douchey that was what got you joe what got you the fucking impression impression  and the singing i mean i can't even wrap you what's wrong with you joe you all right you can't  replace the word brick with solar powered white it's a little shoehorning a little a solar powered 
[02:50:00]  whites a house a green technology what al gore's been talking about solar powered whites  the gop recoils and tempers boil but i'm cutting our defense on oil  it's like a nixon impression you know the suns are the best thing to wonder house  and the west wing yeah yeah how can we lose if solar is used earth is saved jobs are made cap and 
[02:50:30]  trade it's my winning plan solar powered whites what uh house i can uh it's clean energy and that's  what's what it's all about solar powered whites still going  house still on uh it's all right to use sunlight except when it's dark at night 
[02:51:00]  shake it down shake it down now shake it down shake it down now  it's niggie niggie  it's so fucking bad we that is so fucking bad if you think that that's even remotely funny yeah  yeah it's good fucking kill yourself oh why would kill themselves it's it's all right don't kill  yourself uh uh solar powered white i'm sorry what should they do did i go too far that's good 
[02:51:30]  uh solar powered white uh a solar powered white uh uh let's forget about watergate and uh get on  hot water uh solar powered white  solar powered remove those solar patterns well white house oh my god hey white house take down  those solar panels and do you want to stay after the show and maybe produce a bit i have some ideas

[02:56:00]  out in l.a doing something show up and norton takes a powder and he decided he's yeah forget it  he flew out to l.a to do some leno stuff he's like leno's guy now time now yeah now he's ready for on  camera yeah this radio stuff is like second fiddle for him now when leno calls he runs radio is just  his hobby at this point he's becoming a big star he runs a big star he'll never get that picture 
[02:56:30]  and and i'm mad that he's not here edward because he's gonna talk about the fact that he missed  seeing you for the next how many months it's never gonna stop it's never gonna stop until you see him  again or something he has canceled really important gigs for himself just to meet famous people that's how  twisted uh the jim norton is he's a little crazy and he talks about how you would go down to the  comedy cellar sometimes and see him yeah probably once yeah but he goes like yeah sometimes oh yeah  yeah he comes down there and sees me yeah you know he likes using the word you know men of similar ilk 
[02:57:00]  yeah get together and does he do things like oh he goes you know my friend ed ed ed norton  yeah yeah yeah ed uh ed norton does he do that of course yeah yeah same last name still talk about  his nipples a lot uh yeah i used to have a bit in his routine about he still has that yeah he doesn't  have a very good um body image right he talks about himself a body of a scallop uh he's got his man  boobs he calls them and stuff he's very self-deprecating i don't have a good body image of jim 
[02:57:30]  either of jim i thought you were going to say of yourself but no of jim and it goes further uh  iraq is holding the photo edward that you have to sign for jim norton oh these he gets crazy when  people are in here and jimmy's not here he gives instructions that are crazy iraq what were the  instructions for the big edward norton photo today sign it with the silver one make sure he does this  no this is real by the way we're not doing a radio bit listen to iraq for two seconds it's a fresh  never used uh sharpie that has to be run across paper for at least 30 seconds so it's crushed just 
[02:58:00]  the way he likes it on both sides so that there's no chance that either too much ink comes out or say  he signs it really fast that it skips and you won't get all oh forget it then i'm gonna do all  that and i'm gonna sign best wishes ed burns  oh my god well we don't even have that much time so uh let's uh get into the movie uh stone 
[02:58:30]  yeah this one looks like a good one man it's heavy yeah it's really heavy you're playing arsonist right  yeah it's about um de niro plays a prison you know a parole review officer and he's about to retire  and he gets one more case that at the end that he that he's gotta review uh you know an inmate and i  i play this the inmate um and and basically he's he's supposed to assess you know whether people have 
[02:59:00]  made authentic changes in their life and gotten a spiritual life and all these things and and the  whole the whole dynamic is about him trying to sort out whether this guy is is for real has he  have has he changed is he positive and and on the side the prisoner is getting his wife uh who mila  jovovich plays to to try to manipulate the guy outside the prison um and it's uh it's it's thrilling 
[02:59:30]  but it's not it's actually not sort of just a a twist or a plot it's it's very much about like  the prisoner starts questioning what this guy's done in his life that gives him the right to  judge him and it's it's it's a it's a pretty heavy um i put it almost more in the vein of like  dead man walking or american history x or it's it's a pretty serious action or  um yeah that's pretty cool although mila jovovich is also yeah we've had her in here a couple of  times she's great she's a blast she's funny as hell very funny i'll tell you too i i gotta say i 
[03:00:00]  i had seen her in um in that spike lee film he got game and i thought she was really great and so  we brought her in on this and and uh if you've only seen her in you know like the resident evil  stuff she's she's phenomenal in this film like she's gonna she's gonna win a war i mean she's gonna  get like the accolades for this she's she's really tremendous and it's really cool she was out of  control in that movie dummy with adrian brody like i it was the first time i'd ever seen her in 
[03:00:30]  anything like that and i was just like holy shit man she's off the chart and it's like like i i was  we were all seriously impressed by by what she did in it yeah she was cool when she came in and  i remember saying something and she fell off the chair yeah and all i kept thinking was i think i got  a shot like guys are so stupid they really are dumb yeah mila jovovich and like dumb  freaking jock guy you start telling yourself like a hot girl doesn't want a hot guy they want a funny  guy yeah they want funny guy and you know i bet a lot of people are just intimidated to even walk 
[03:01:00]  up to her no no they're not gq model guys are not intimidated to walk up good dummies like me  she's just a lost girl she just wants somebody to treat her like a human being for work  you uh worked with de niro before you know we were just talking about that and you know the score  which was a great movie um you uh it's almost comical how you come off as being handicapped 
[03:01:30]  a little mentally um when you first come on screen people who know me didn't think it was that much of  a stretch oh really that's like he played yeah he does that he plays that part very well he's done  that a few times in movies obviously where does that come from um you know i don't know uh do you have  a split personality no but actually it was kind of the same as on this one i on that one i i we were  in montreal and there was a there was a school um for you know to say adults with different disabilities 
[03:02:00]  uh and stuff and i just i hung out there a lot with these some of these guys who had bad cerebral  palsy and stuff like that and i i i find for me it's like you know the the main thing is just i just like  to hang out around someone else and for a long time and you know just sort of soak it in and and  on stone the on stone the the i i was i was kind of feeling a little bit not where i wanted to be and  then i i like five days before we started shooting i met a an inmate at this detroit this michigan prison 
[03:02:30]  who was uh so hypnotizing he was really really fascinating and and i literally like i called the director  and said check this guy out and he gave me like a great feeling for the look and the voice and  really was he uh was he an arson arsonist no no he was he he was a guy actually it was two guys one  one guy was a white guy who had helped start the crips gang in detroit and the other guy was he'd  been involved in the drug trade since he was like 10 or 11 years old you know yeah just come up through 
[03:03:00]  it all and been in and out of prison and do you always feel you have to like get into uh character by  maybe hanging out with people that are um that were doing the same thing your character is doing  yeah it's it's better for me i mean i don't you know it's like i i don't i don't really want to  see a movie about me all right i just don't this is my interpretation no yeah and i just don't i just  don't um i don't know i get there are actors i guess you know if you're there are actors who it kind 
[03:03:30]  of what you're getting is that is some a thing they like to do over and over again they feel  confident in it i i think i'm better off if i sort of uh you know slip into some some other other  thing it seems like there are movies like this where that would come in handy but you take a movie  like fight club what would you really base that character on like who would you talk to or try to  emulate that's a that's a good question i think of course it is yeah i don't know i that was like 
[03:04:00]  somehow that one to me was just chuck palaniuk's book the voice in that book is so specific in fight  club and i don't know i think we kind of felt like it was all like fincher fincher's humor also is like  that guy and i i think to me he was kind of a stand-in for for a lot of us you know maybe that was a  little closer to some of us than than really a cat you know i that was was that kind of more more 
[03:04:30]  of you then maybe maybe a little more there yeah yeah what what what's great about fight club uh you  guys didn't disappoint as far as the book goes and the movie goes that happens all the time but i mean  i love both i love the book to this day and i love the movie i mean i know how everybody likes to say  the book is usually better but i mean i've read fight club and i've seen fight club a thousand times  the movie in my opinion it kills the book i love actually you know we love chuck and i love and i  think that book is this is a really that's one of the most original books i had read yeah yeah from 
[03:05:00]  that era but chuck chuck loved the ending of fight club week you know the ending is different in the  film than the book he loved it he he was way into it so it was all pretty happy but being a fan of the  the book i wasn't disappointed that happens so so many times with movies right oh yeah yeah i know  i i'm a movie guy more than a book yeah he doesn't i don't i don't want to come off as an idiot who's  just like a movie better than book right but uh it just a lot of times i kind of like the visual medium 
[03:05:30]  of just movies as opposed to trying to use my own imagination i'm very distracted when i read first and  then if i like it i want to see how it progressed to the screen so then i'll go back and read oh really  yeah i like and then it's it's just interesting to see how it made it probably a better way to do  it it's too bad because mila jovovich told me she likes guys who read uh damn it see i i well i have  read i like that you i like that you said medium too to smarten that statement yeah see i had to try  to do something visual medium shut up joe i'm pointing things out like that we are trying to sound 
[03:06:00]  real smart i'm just trying i know we don't have we don't have a lot of time that's why it's just so  many things i wanted to ask you was uh american history x like difficult to do because it was  just so probably from what i know about you from reading reading about you uh that seems to be so  not you that character especially the beginning of the movie maybe the redemption toward the ending but  um yeah you know it's one of those things you gotta i think you gotta have an a good idea of what 
[03:06:30]  you're aiming at before you take that on you know you don't some of the scenes in that film you don't  you don't want to do that if it's gonna if if if the if the total message of the film isn't  going to be something you know a positive or yeah right right or if not redeeming then at least like  really i think for me a lot of it was my friend david who wrote it and and we worked on it together 
[03:07:00]  for a long time we we kind of you know said this is this is about the consequences of of letting anger  take over your life you know and and if you don't and so it's like you if you know what the end target  is which is that that at the end you know it's it's supposed to show the downsides of of letting  things like that take you over then then you can say okay we we know we're aiming at a at a certain  message so then we can investigate the even even so though there's like i mean the scene with elliot 
[03:07:30]  gould is brutal i mean brutal yeah how do you after cut i mean do you just kind of look at each  other and go haha that was funny i you know use shylock and kike and you know just  like that it's like is there some kind of a wind down period or any tension or um elliot he was great  i mean you do want to you know you got you got to know that everybody in it everyone in it with you 
[03:08:00]  is going for the same things you know i mean if everybody if everybody knows what's bad and it's  not just them it's like the crew you know we had a we had we had people from every background on  the crew and and everybody was into it everyone was into what we were doing so i guess it's so  detached when you're like obviously i have no clue about what being on a set like that would be i  just watched the end product yeah so to me it looks like oh my god would that be uncomfortable  but i guess you know fortunately you know really cool he's a big hugger yeah a lot of hugs between 
[03:08:30]  scenes at the end of the day that'd be nice with your swastika tattoo nice big hug i'd be like oh  sorry i left a little of that on your white shirt yeah you might want to a little shout on that one  actually ethan suplee um he he you remember ethan he's on um what is it that show now my name is  earl or something like that oh yeah yeah yeah god damn what he was yeah yeah he was really big  back then he was huge but he went we were shooting all night one night and he went out with all his 
[03:09:00]  white power tattoos like four in the morning he went home without taking them off and he went into  some 7-eleven and and some guy like really got came like came in on him over it why would you talk  he was like i'm an actor i'm an actor it's like he's like we're trying to run it off it comes off  it comes off it comes off wow wow that is uh yeah that's brutal i saw an interview with you when you  when when you when american history x came out and you said i've seen a lot of actors say this before 
[03:09:30]  where they go they go i wanted you to do this with the character i wanted it to be this and that and  something you said of the character was the most spot-on that i ever heard an actor say it where you  said i wanted you to almost be convinced by this guy and then at the last second he loses you and  you realize no he's he's he's deranged or whatever and you totally nailed that you watch that movie and  like you get to this uncomfortable place where you're like jesus christ his argument is so oh wait  no okay no he's fucked up you know what i mean he's kind of right like but to get that conflict out 
[03:10:00]  of the viewer is that's not an easy thing you know that's i think that but that i don't know i i  think a lot about like the movies when you think about movies that really make a dent in you you  know they're they're not the ones that spoon feed you you know if they if they spoon feed you you  kind of you kind of distance i i think you walk out and you go cool where do you want to eat you  know what i mean and and whereas i think like when i mean we're all the same age i think i think 
[03:10:30]  like like when i when i was 19 i saw do the right thing you know and i grew up near baltimore and  went to a public school and when that movie came out you know it puts i mean it was the same thing  you're talking about it you you you felt for everybody you felt for the race to racist pizza  maker you know you knew what he was saying but you knew he was wrong and you knew mookie was like why  he was mad but then he puts the garbage can through you know every but everybody was right and wrong  and at the end he just put that quote up from martin luther king and then the opposite from malcolm x and 
[03:11:00]  he just went you know what what do you what do you want to make of this like what do you want to  do and i and i remember i remember going oh my god like oh like i walked out of the theater when  i you know just going your your whole head was rattled by the movie and and and it made you if it if  a movie leaves you room to think about where you come out on it yourself then i think it sticks  with you i think i think fight club is the same i think fight club has stuck with so many people  because it it's it's it's about nihilism but it doesn't but at the end it's sort of the same 
[03:11:30]  thing it sort of makes it look sexy but then it shows you the downside and then it kind of leaves  you with this ambiguous ending and you and and that's why people still debate it you know what  i mean they still go well what was it this was it that what's the point and i think i i the guy who  made stone is is in that camp of directors for me he he he's got the the balls kind of to say i'm i'm not  i'm not gonna talk to you like you're an idiot i'm gonna i'm gonna put these questions out there  and at the end you kind of have to go you know who was good who who was playing who who was bad 
[03:12:00]  and i think that's healthy i think there yeah there there are some movies that'll end the credits  will start rolling and i'll be like what the what exactly no what are you doing but then i'll find  myself with movies like that looking on the internet i'm like trying to see what other people thought  about it and stuff and and for days you're just kind of thinking like well yeah i guess that could  mean this or the other and it is so much better than the just neatly wrapped package movies yeah um 
[03:12:30]  i mean i you know to me it's sort of like you know it's like oh all these things happened in the  story and i died but it's all okay because because i went to heaven you know yeah yeah things things  that things that make it comfortable at the end i don't i don't think they really stick with you if if  they if they make sure that you're like that you know that everything turned out all right then  you're just kind of like i think exactly where do you want to eat yeah it is and i think um i i i 
[03:13:00]  like it i like ones that leave you a little unsettled i think i think i mean you look at you if you look  at de niro's films that that like in that seminal period when he was making some of these films that  have become classics they weren't commercial they weren't they didn't do well but like taxi driver  yeah taxi driver everyone goos all over that movie oh it's a classic class but you watch that  movie the end of that movie is you have no fucking idea what the what that movie means yeah like you  know what i mean it's like at the end you it's like that weird over crank shot of him in the rearview 
[03:13:30]  mirror and you're like did he is he did he get it out of him or is he about to do it again yeah is  he did they make him a hero they made him a hero kind of but what you know you yeah is it just  delusional it's so twisted you have no idea what how you're supposed to take the king of comedy too  is like that where at the end the whole debate was is this really happening or is this the  rupert pupkins imagination again or did he yeah yeah did he really yeah yeah i love i love that  when you i think donnie darko was another movie where i just had to sit there for days going what 
[03:14:00]  did i just watch yeah and have to read about like read again see joe about what uh was going on in  that movie he reads see wikipedia's yeah whatever uh yeah you have to go i i guess we got to wrap this  up um anyway well we want to make sure people go and see stone yes obviously we're talking about  all his old movies but he's got a brand new one that's uh out in theaters friday and it looks like  another great one man absolutely new york and la this weekend and then um and then wider on the 15th
