<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a highly charged, chaotic mix of recurring segments, listener calls, in-studio guests, and offensive humor. The show opened with "Whip-a-Low Wednesday," focusing on a car sticker campaign ("WOW" stickers) and suggestive interactions with female drivers.  This segment included a discussion about baseball managers' uniforms, a detailed recounting of a video showing an umpire being hit in the face with a baseball (with a call from the umpire himself), and numerous calls detailing listener experiences with the "WOW" stickers, many explicitly sexual.  The hosts played music, including country versions of rock songs and a song about "big balls," and promoted their upcoming "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest."  Earl, the sticker distributor, repeatedly called in with updates from his chaotic sticker distribution at a Staten Island Hooters, initially providing confusing directions before finally clarifying his location.  A discussion ensued about a new intern with 36C breasts, and the segment also featured listener complaints, speculation about a caller's boyfriend's Cancun trip, and advertisements for "Monkey Grams" and  "Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed".  

The show continued with more "WOW" sticker related calls and a lengthy in-studio conversation with Jay Moore, who shared a humorous anecdote about a plane ride with Alec Baldwin and Jason Sehorn.  This segment heavily featured listener calls sharing their own "WOW" experiences, some explicitly sexual, including a detailed recount of a sexual encounter facilitated by a "WOW" sticker from a caller named TJ and a confusing call from Julie/July, with the hosts questioning her gender. Another caller, Tony, reported seeing two attractive women who were "WOWing," and Earl's increasingly erratic distribution of stickers, which he eventually blamed on illness, was discussed. The "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" and a planned segment comparing Opie and Anthony's "sickest" radio calls were also promoted.  A caller, Drudge Jr., attempted to share some Christopher Walken-related information, but his call devolved into a rambling exchange.


A subsequent segment showcased a chaotic and sexually charged conversation with multiple tangents. A bizarre, vaguely ethnic-slur-laden interaction with an unidentified caller escalated into discussions of cocaine and Dominican neighborhoods.  This transitioned into a sperm-selling scheme proposed by one of the hosts, with ludicrous scenarios involving "Mrs. Manacotti" and "Alice."  Jay Moore was present in the studio, discussing his upcoming appearances at Caroline's Comedy Club and on *Regis and Kelly*. A teenage girl, Kelly, was brought into the studio, resulting in sexually suggestive comments from the hosts and male guests, including propositions to touch her breasts and discussion of her boyfriend's alleged infidelity in Cancun.  The "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" was heavily promoted again, detailing rules and prizes, further fueling the sexually suggestive atmosphere.  Opie and Anthony replayed prank calls, one where Opie falsely informed a woman that her friend Bill had died and another where Anthony called a funeral home requesting to speak to the deceased, leading to a "scumbag" competition between the hosts and numerous listener calls debating who was the bigger "scumbag".  The segment was punctuated by vulgar jokes and sexually suggestive comments.


A final segment featured a chaotic mix of phone calls, in-studio banter, and the "Hi, Mom" prank call segment. The segment started with a caller recounting a vulgar encounter with Otto and George, a comedy duo, using extremely offensive language. The hosts and guests exchanged similarly offensive jokes and insults, targeting various groups and individuals.  Joey, Otto, and George were mentioned as being in studio. A particularly harsh "Hi, Mom" prank call where a man pretended to be in jail for soliciting prostitutes (one allegedly with AIDS) was played, eliciting a distressed reaction from his mother. The hosts and callers reacted with a mix of laughter and shock. The segment also included promotion for "Pinnacle Monkeying Around," discussion about a planned appearance at Bar 9 to support Brother Joe, and further vulgar jokes and anecdotes, including a story about James Brown's alleged sexual behavior. Jay Moore, a guest in the studio, contributed to the offensive humor and promoted his appearance on *Regis and Kelly*.  Highly offensive and derogatory language was used throughout, targeting women, gay men, and other groups. The segment concluded with more vulgar jokes, promotions, and shout-outs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Booze, the world's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  Whip-a-Low Wednesday!  Obi and Anthony, the brain is in their hands.  1027 WNA-W.  Whip-a-Low Wednesday! Woo-hoo!  Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low!  This place blows. 
[00:00:30]  Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low! Whip-a-Low!  Get your balls and kick us out!  It's the O&H Show.  What's up, everybody?  Hello.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's Whip-a-Low Wednesday, yeah?  Yes. Yes.  Of course it is.  We love the Whip-a-Low Wednesday.  Nice day for us. Still early in the season. A little chilly.  A little on the chilly side.  Yeah, it's just spring taking its sweet-ass time again. 
[00:01:00]  Supposed to be in the mid-60s.  And I'm sure everybody at Shea is freezing.  I sit there in the wind. It's 55 degrees or something.  Where's spring? I want 70s.  It's on the way, Anthony.  They got to start the baseball season this early.  Got to get all 162 games in.  Yeah.  God forbid we miss a few.  That's why it's so lame.  I'm like, oh, we lost last night. 
[00:01:30]  Who cares?  Dropped four in a row.  Who cares?  Wake me up when it's August.  Yeah.  Speaking of baseball.  Yeah.  Can we get rid of the manager's uniform?  Are they really going into play?  Yeah, that looks really silly.  You know, I guess maybe it made sense when baseball first started.  They wanted it all. 
[00:02:00]  I don't even understand why the manager ever suited up like he was ready to play.  Yeah.  Half the managers are overweight, fat, with beer bellies.  They look completely ridiculous.  The Zim looks good, though.  The Zim?  The Zim looks great in his uniform.  You know, baseball is the only sport that they do this, too.  Yeah.  That the manager dresses like the team.  Wears the same uniform.  Imagine seeing Jeff Van Gundy with the baggy Nick shorts on the sideline with his Nike sneakers waiting to go in, possibly.  And his hair plugs. 
[00:02:30]  His hair plugs and his muscle shirt.  That would be good.  Why not?  Just like baseball.  Have him dressed like the Knicks.  Sure.  Football coaches, you put him in the football uniforms.  Imagine when Parcells was coached and you put him in the big, you know, shoulder pads.  Shoulder pads.  Like just in case.  Helmet.  Just in case he's on the roster.  You could send him in.  It's really not that far-fetched, right?  I mean, why is the baseball manager, you know, suited up and ready to go?  Should be in the suit.  You know?  Something.  Something casual. 
[00:03:00]  Casual, you think?  Casual wear?  There's a manager out there that should take the lead and, you know, just tell the team, you know what?  I'm not wearing the uniform.  I'm not going in ever.  Why do I have to wear this?  Am I ever going to be put in the game?  Right.  Yeah.  Just like show up in the dugout in an Armani suit or something and start a whole new trend.  We don't have any leaders today.  No.  You think it would take off or I think you'd be bashed?  All the sports writers would be like, oh, tradition.  Tradition.  This is ruining tradition. 
[00:03:30]  That's the only tradition still left in the game.  That the manager looks completely ridiculous in the dugout dressed like the players.  Yeah.  Who took that friggin' ball in the face the other day?  Did you see that one?  One of the umps.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I just caught it.  I didn't see the team or anything, but I saw a clip of it.  Someone in the outfield spins around to throw the ball back.  And one of the umps, right in the way, just fires a baseball from four feet right into 
[00:04:00]  this guy's nose.  Did the nose explode?  Oh, yeah.  Completely exploded.  He was on the bench with ice on his face looking dazed.  It's a great clip.  Someone's going to explain why the baseball managers wear the uniform.  Mark?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Good afternoon.  The reason why the managers are allowed to wear the or have to wear the uniform is  they're the only managers in all the sports that are actually allowed to go on to the  field to play at any time.  Basketball coaches, technically, they're not supposed to be in the courts. 
[00:04:30]  Hockey coaches, they don't go on the court.  The football coaches don't go on the field.  But the managers are allowed to go into the field to play.  Why do they have to be dressed to go on the field, though?  Well, again, this goes back to tradition.  I think Connie Mack used to wear a coat and tie way back when.  That's right.  When you see some of those old photos, that's right.  Some of the old-time managers did wear, like, more.  But he was the only one.  You know, you just answered that question for me, though, because I always wondered why they  were the only ones.  Yeah, that's it.  I still think it's completely ridiculous, and you don't need to dress like a ball player  to, you know, to step onto the field. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, you can't hide a beer belly behind anything.  And Jeff Van Gundy, he's always on the court.  True.  Half the time getting in fights, he might as well look like one of the guys with the droopy  Nick shorts and the muscle shirt.  It's just when you're a coach and you've got the big gut hanging out, baseball uniform  really doesn't help out covering up some of those chubby areas that you might have.  Very true.  I'm going to go listen to myself, guys.  Take care.  At least the pinstripes make you look thinner.  Yeah, there you go.  The Yankees are in love.  I hear that in the fashion world that, yeah, pinstripes. 
[00:05:30]  Stripes going down make you look thinner.  Well, it's lurking.  Sideways makes you look fat no matter who you are.  I said, the Zimmer just, he's a rail in those pinstripes.  Paul, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Just to dispute that last caller, back in the day there was a guy by the name of Connie Mack.  She used to wear a suit, and they're a lot on the field.  I just think it's, I don't know, a fashion idea on their part.  So, that's about it.  There's nothing fashionable about it.  That's true. 
[00:06:00]  But, hey, that's my input for today, guys.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Yeah, they probably want to feel like they're in the game, you know.  Yeah, one of the guys.  Feeling a little left out?  Yeah.  Yeah, Lou Piniello looks great in his little uniform.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got the story behind that umpire getting clocked in the face of that ball.  Yeah, what was that?  Guy hits a little ball.  It's Arizona Diamondbacks playing.  Guy hits a ball up the middle, like behind second base.  Yeah.  And the second baseman for Arizona is Jay Bell. 
[00:06:30]  He catches the ball, like, towards the outfield grass and just turns to fire to first, not even looking.  Three feet behind him is the umpire staring right at him.  Oh, I saw the clip.  It hit him in the face so hard.  He threw it as hard as he could from three feet away.  It hit the guy square between the eyes.  So what happened to the umpire?  He just went down like he got shot.  And Jay Bell just stood there like, oh, what did I do?  Did you see that?  The guy's face went like he exploded.  I saw the clip.  You saw the clip on ESPN or something? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it was sick.  So what happened to the umpire?  I mean, did he break his nose, his face?  Yeah, they said he's got a broken nose.  He needed like 14 stitches and his face is going to be swollen for three weeks.  He was sitting on the bench dazed, like his eyes, he looked like a cartoon character.  He had birds around his head and he had ice on his forehead, but he was bleeding like crazy.  And he just looked like he was on another planet.  But the clip, I mean, picture, you couldn't get Johnny Knoxville to do this.  Nope.  Stand three feet away from a guy, a professional ball player, who was going to whip the ball as 
[00:07:30]  hard as he can at your face from three feet.  I'm just hoping maybe someone sends us the clip so we can put it up on the website.  It was the sickest thing I've ever seen.  It was crazy.  Hey, we got some audio right after the ump got here.  There's no crying in baseball!  Here's the ump.  Anyway.  Thank you, Ed.  All right, fellas.  All right.  Well, we're sick Fs.  Now we need to know where we can see that clip.  Yeah, I got to see it.  Someone help us out.  Where can you see the clip of the ump getting it from three feet away? 
[00:08:00]  Just a bit outside.  He's right in the corner and missed.  Just a bit.  I'm going to try a website.  Anthony on line 11.  Managers are technically players they can play if they want.  Oh, yeah.  Who's buying that?  Yeah, Lou Piniello looks like he's ready to go in at any moment.  How you doing?  It's the truth, man.  Yeah, but you know it's not happening.  No, but years ago, the managers were a lot younger.  Just because they're old fat guys now doesn't make it any difference.  You could hire a young manager who could put himself in the lineup at any time. 
[00:08:30]  But that would be like a player manager.  Wasn't Pete Rose a player manager for a little while?  Yeah.  Well, they invented that term, but it's just because they didn't have anybody telling the  team what to do years ago, and that's how the manager job developed.  All I'm saying is I think we can all agree that the managers look really ridiculous dressing  like the ball players, and it's time to change.  I think the fat old managers look ridiculous.  But, yeah, I see your point there.  But it's not just because they get to walk out on the field.  They're technically players.  It's just because they're older.  You know, we could be on to something today.  Other things that need to change. 
[00:09:00]  Other things that need to change.  Yeah, you guys need to get syndicated.  That's what needs to change.  Yeah.  Okay, Rock.  Thank you.  I found the clip.  Yeah, but it's real small.  We got the clip, but it's really, really small.  All right, hold on.  I haven't seen this yet.  So he hits the double, right?  And then what?  That was just a guy hitting a double.  We still don't have it.  That wasn't it.  It's a two-minute clip, so it's got to get to it.  We're doing what?  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Okay.  Guy coming home. 
[00:09:30]  Nothing.  It's a two-minute clip.  It's a two-minute clip, so it's like...  What, they have the whole inning?  Yeah.  Is that what that's about?  All right.  All right, hold on.  Bear with us.  Yeah.  Bear with us.  If we find him, Steve will link it to foundrymusic.com immediately.  All right.  There we go.  How do you know?  Oh, my God!  Holy S. 
[00:10:00]  Look, come here.  There's trouble.  It's not the greatest clip, but you get the idea.  Guy was throwing to first base.  You could see the camera wanted to follow the ball.  It's like, hey, where'd the ball go?  Right.  Oh, it went into the ump's face.  It never got past the ump part.  That was three feet in front of the second baseman.  Oh, just full blast in the face.  Nice.  All right, so I'm going to say the ump story is incorrect.  I want to tell my side of the story.  Go ahead.  Uh, I'm the umpire. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, sheesh.  Blackie pit alert.  Sorry.  That was the umpire himself.  Liz, what's going on?  Hey, Liz.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  Is there a sticker stock today?  It is Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  We've got to get those WOW stickers to you guys.  So, yes, Earl is heading to Staten Island, I think.  Okay.  Do we know where in Staten Island yet?  That would help.  Highland Boulevard on Staten Island, all right?  He knows how to get there. 
[00:11:00]  Everything's fine.  He'll be checking it soon.  Liz, will you be Whippin' Mount if you see the WOW today?  I will be Whippin' Mount.  Thank you very much.  I'll do anything for you guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Look at the still picture of his face.  Wow.  On ESPN.  Yeah, go to ESPN.  He was hurt.  He looked like a Carmine Gigante when they were leading him around in the robe.  Vinny the Chin. 
[00:11:30]  Another observation from Heckler.  Heckler, what's going on?  Hey, greetings from the reef.  Hey, what's up?  A good observation.  How come people who go to tennis matches dress like tennis players in the stands?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, a lot of tennis fans decide to wear the girls with a little spirits, the guys with  sweaters or whatever, thinking they're tennis pros.  Hey, can I say RonFez.net?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  We love you guys.  All right.  Peace.  Peace.  Okay, we've just begun. 
[00:12:00]  It's Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  It's a beautiful day to WOW.  We don't want to bore you with all the details, but basically, ladies, you know what to do  if you see a WOW in a car.  Guys, get your WOW stickers on your cars or make the homemade WOW.  That works as well.  Yeah.  If you see the WOW ladies, feel free to make the guy's day.  And believe me, it does.  You guys driving home from work, maybe it's rush hour, a pain in the ass.  If he has a WOW on the car and you flash him, you have made someone's day.  You are like, I don't know, better than a doctor. 
[00:12:30]  You're making someone feel good.  You're going to make someone's weak.  Yeah.  And if you need the WOW stickers, send in the self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th  Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Tommy wants to complain.  Tommy!  I want to.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I have bad news for you.  Yeah.  Highland Boulevard goes from the Verrazano Bridge to the Gothels Bridge.  Oh, good.  So we should probably be a little bit more specific.  Good.  That's just a thought.  Well, thanks for that little bit of information. 
[00:13:00]  Sure.  Quick question for you.  Yeah.  I don't have a WOW sticker yet.  You think I could put a bandana on my antenna?  I love you guys.  FK Rocky.  All right.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know how we like to let our music do the talking?  Sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  We do that a lot.  We get some messages out there by playing music from time to time, right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  So I want to play a tune as we go to break, okay? 
[00:13:30]  Awesome.  This says it all.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  Well, I've never ever played high society.  Got a gift about a ring of rain.  And I always feel my balls in this little small.  They say I got the best balls at all. 
[00:14:00]  I got big balls.  Yeah, I got big balls.  There's such big balls.  There's 30 big balls.  Yeah, he's got big balls.  He's got big balls.  He's got big balls.  I got big balls.  The balls are always bouncing.  The balls are always full.  Everybody comes and comes in.  If your name's on the guest list, no one can take care.  Everybody says I got great balls to fire.  I got big balls.  Oh, I got big balls.  There's such big balls.  There's big balls. 
[00:14:30]  He's got big balls.  He's got big balls.  We got the best balls.  The balls are all.  Some balls are hell for charity and some for fancy dress.  When they're hell for pleasure, they're balls.  I like this.  My balls are always bouncing.  They're left and to right.  And it's my belief that my big balls should be held every night.  I got big balls.  Oh, I got big balls.  There's such big balls.  There's lots of big balls.  Oh, I got big balls.  There's lots of big balls.  There's lots of big balls.  He's got big balls. 
[00:15:00]  He's got big balls.  We got the best balls for football.  Now you know I'm so itchy and big balls now.  We always have such a wonderful ball.  People have got the best balls.  Here we go, Daddy.  Here we go, Daddy.  Everybody switch.  Have a man listen with your right hand. 
[00:15:30]  Join your partner, good bro.  Get around and don't be doing.  Kiss up.  Ride on the face.  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming starting next Monday.

And what a show it was yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  I went to the back office. 
[00:16:30]  So did you.  So did the whole crew.  And what did we do?  What did we do?  Cracked open a case of Sam Adams.  That's right.  And started drinking heavily.  Yeah.  And I think Stinky dropped the ball yesterday.  Was it Stinky?  No, no, no.  It was John.  Because there was a case of Sam Adams.  It was ice cold.  But he didn't refrigerate.  So it sat out for the whole show.  It was still kind of cold, but not icy cold.  But still, we drank it because it's that good. 
[00:17:00]  You could drink it.  You could drink it even if it isn't ice cold.  I prefer my beer cold, though.  And, man, they're giving us a ton of this stuff.  To the point we can't even, like, put our lunches in the refrigerator anymore.  I know.  I'm thinking of opening up a little Sam Adams pub.  You know, right up here.  We'll use all the Sam Adams.  We'll charge, cover charge, a minimum.  We could lower a box from our office all the way down the street and have the people, like,  put money in the box and then pull up the box, get the money, and then, you know, lower down a beer. 
[00:17:30]  I'm thinking we just open up a club when we have, like, comedians in here.  You know, isn't Jay Moore coming in today?  Yes, he is.  All right.  We just work it.  We have people come up.  They can see Jay Moore.  They can drink some Sam Adams.  And we charge them like a comedy club.  Why not?  Eight bucks a beer.  It'll be great.  Sam Adams, it's crisp, refreshing.  We love it.  Drinking in the back in the office all the time when we get off for the show.  I want to sit back and relax for a second until the next crisis. 
[00:18:00]  But in between crises and during them, well, all the time, Sam Adams.  They have the summer ale out now, too.  A lot of seasonal beer, Sam Adams.  It's great beer.  Check it out if you're out or you're just shopping for beer for the house.  Sam Adams.  This is not the Discovery Channel.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The Louise and Blacko Show.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:18:30]  She was a fast machine.  She kept the motor clean. 
[00:19:00]  She was the best damn woman that I've ever seen.  She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies.  Knocked me out with them American thighs.  Thinking more than a share.  Had me back for air.  She told me to come, but I was already there.  If the walls was shaking, the earth was a question.  My mind was shaking.  We was a man in the air.  She took me all night long. 
[00:19:30]  Let me tell you now, yeah.  She took me all night long.  Working double time on my seduction line.  She's one of a kind.  She's just mine, oh, mine.  I want no flaws.  Just a matter of cost.  Make a meal out of me.  Come back for more.  Had to cool me down. 
[00:20:00]  Take all this shit around.  Now I'm back in the rain.  Take it to the swing.  Yeah, the walls was a-singin'.  Earth was a-quickin'.  My mind was a-quickin'.  My mind was a-quickin'.  We were a-quickin'.  You shook me all night long.  I have mercy on you.  You shook me all night long.  You really took me to you.  You shook me all night long. 
[00:20:30]  You shouted me out and you shook me all night long.  What we're dealin' with here is a complete lack of respect for the lost.  Country 1027.  Yeah, boy.  Playin' your country's favor.  What the hell were you thinking?  Country 1027. 
[00:21:00]  For all you street walkers.  Concrete walkers.  This one's dedicated to scooters.  Scooters.  It's all you Abercrombie and Fitzmitters.  He took me all night long.  He really took me to you.  Come here, boy.  He took me all night long.  He knocked me out and you took me all night long.

[00:22:00]  It's Whippamall Wednesday.  Okay.  Patiently waiting for Earl to check in.  He's somewhere on Staten Island.  Yeah, somewhere on Highland Boulevard.  Which stretches the entire length of Staten Island.  They're like, hey, Earl, where are you going to be on Staten Island?  I'm going to be on Highland Boulevard.  Oh, okay.  That's like saying, I'm going to be out on Long Island.  Where?  Oh, on the expressway. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, okay.  And he doesn't listen to the station, so he doesn't know we're even talking about him.  What does he listen to when he's in that van?  Country 1027.  Yeah, he's a good old boy.  Go around.  We have more of your country favorites on the way.  Probably giving the management of N.E.W. some ideas.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  We'll just go country. 
[00:23:00]  New York's country.  Couldn't be worse than it's doing now.  New York's country.  We'll put a hitch in your get-along.  It's the Wrangler and Dreamweaver show.  Yeah.  I don't think so. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  There's Earl.  We got Earl?  Hold on a second.  Maybe he knows where he is.  Hey, Earl.  Earl?  Hey, Earl.  One sec.  One sec.  He's coming.  Who's that?  Earl?  Earl.  Yeah.  Where are you?  We just set up the exit.  We're headed towards Highland Boulevard.  Highland Boulevard is a very, very big place.  It stretches the entire length.  It's a big road.  Yes, I know that guy.  So where on Highland Boulevard?  We're still figuring that out. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Call us when you figure it out, okay?  Yes.  People want to pick up their Wow stickers today.  Okay.  All right.  All right, then.  I'm at Latitude 275.  I'll give you a longitude sometime soon.  But come and get me.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Who's the girl?  Who's the chick?  All right.  She's the invisible woman.  Anthony, we have Brian Johnson on the hotline.  Brian!  It's good, my intelligence.  It's good, it's good, my intelligence. 
[00:24:30]  You wouldn't find a thing about telepox.  I've got a list of this.  I'd rather punch over in the liver.  And I've got knees on the tongue and ears.  What's the matter, you know?  I ain't just going to rather love.  I've got a shoe tonight.  And I've got a list of other shite.  Brian, with all that money you've made over the years, I would think you would have a better car phone.  Listen, I can screw the hot chicks.  I can screw the skinny guys.  I screw the mullins.  Hey, does Brian want to call us on a better phone, maybe?

See, she said you don't know one way to ride.  One way to ride.  In the bed.  Leave me be.  Taking every pain in my stride. 
[00:26:00]  Don't need reason.  Don't need rhyme.  There ain't nothing that I'd rather do.  Going down.  Party time.  If my friends don't need that key.  I'm on the highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Don't stop sign.  Speed limit. 
[00:26:30]  Nobody's going to slow me down.  No.  Like a weed.  Can you please?  Nobody's going to get me around.  Can't say done.  Save my fears.  Friend is not that bad.  Hey, mama.  Look at me.

[00:27:30]  We hear you.  Our breakfast makes me.  Our breakfast makes me.  We hear you.  And I'm going to hell  I'm on the highway to hell 
[00:28:00]  I'm on the highway to hell  I got sort of a kind of brains.  Nice, nice. I like that.  We're doing like a public service, too,  because there was a caller on that I guess she hung up,  and she said, well, I finally know the words to that ACDC song.  You know, for years, you're in the car singing,  and you're like,  Denise, what's going on?  Hi, fellas. How you doing?  We're losing our minds today. 
[00:28:30]  What's happening?  It sounds like it. I'm having a blast.  I'm on the highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Now, I have a bone to pick with Anthony.  Pick my bone.  Oh, please.  What's up?  Yesterday, you were talking about your ex-mother-in-law?  Oh, okay.  Okay, so I had a really long day yesterday.  Did a whole lot of driving around the city.  Went to my favorite deli in Brooklyn.  Came out.  I was blocked in by somebody, double parked.  Go back into the store. 
[00:29:00]  I said, all right, fellas, who's got the blue car?  Guy says, I do.  I said, without even thinking.  I go, I want to go home.  See, it's a catchphrase now.  Yeah, yeah.  Without even thinking.  And I went back to the car.  I'm shaking my head going, son of a bitch.  Now I'm using these words to people I don't know.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  Yeah.  People start doing that with this show for some reason.  You know, you're out and you start saying things like, I want to go home. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Three rights, make a left.  The thing is, I even said it in the voice.  That's the best.  I don't curse anymore because of this show.  Yeah, a lot of times it's F or S.  It's cool to say that F and C or whatever, you know?  I do that at home, too, which is great because I have my grandmother at home.  And now when I curse, I just use letters.  Right.  And my mother will laugh because she knows because she listens to you, though.  Right on.  Yeah, but my grandmother has no idea, which is great because she hates the cursing in the house.  I get to vent without having to hold back. 
[00:30:00]  And nobody knows what I'm talking about.  Denise, we've got to cut you off because Earl has figured out where he wants to hang to give out wow stickers today, all right?  Okay, fellas.  And, Denise, please whip them out for us today, all right?  Absolutely.  Look at that, guys.  I think we're making this crap up.  Earl, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We are at Hooters on Highland Boulevard here in Staten Island.  Ah.  And with a wow sticker.  Well, good choice, huh?  It was an appropriate choice, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Yes, look at that.  So, yeah, who's the girl with you?  Sahaba.  She is our new intern.  Sahaba?  Yes.  I probably got the name wrong, but she is our new intern.  We have a new intern?  Yes.  Is it for our show?  I don't know.  Looks like you're making the EOE.  I know as much as I do now.  People happy today.  Sahaba?  Sahaba.  Yeah.  How many categories can we check off of that name?  I believe she's Israeli.  Israeli? 
[00:31:00]  Ah.  That's pretty good.  They're ruthless.  I love the Israeli women.  No, it's true.  They're like crazy women.  They put them in the army at nine years old over in Israel.  Are they the ones with the guns or the slingshots?  Guns.  Okay.  The guns.  They carry around those guns, the Uzis and stuff.  At like nine years old, they have to go in the army.  Nothing better than a hot chick holding a firearm.  Oh, yeah.  Girls of the Israeli army.  That's the next thing I want to see in gallery.  Earl, Hooters, Highland, Staten Island. 
[00:31:30]  Highland Boulevard and Staten Island.  Highland Boulevard.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  What's the nearest cross street?  Honestly, I don't know.  We're in the parking lot and we can't really see the street.  Does she have a bandolier with grenades on them, Earl?  Because those Israeli women, they wear these big bandoliers.  The bandoliers with grenades just strapped all over.  And they're not afraid to use them.  Love that.  All right, Earl.  Yeah, people are already starting to show up.  Cool.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, Earl.  Great job today.  Like always.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  What?  Highland Boulevard.  Hooters.  Hooters.  Staten Island.  That's all I need to know.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to, where are we going here?  Let's go to Tom.  212-757-1027.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I was just curious.  After that abortion yesterday with K-Rock, did the Southern guy ring you to today?  Anthony, comment. 
[00:32:30]  Very funny.  I think the Southern guy's been reallocated.  I think his assets have been reallocated in the company.  We don't know what's going on.  I'm not sure.  I haven't heard from him in a long time.  I'm sure he's still with Infinity.  I think we all know who won the battle.  We're pretty much programming two stations at this point.  And we pretty much shut up everyone over there, didn't we?  Yeah, I think so.  And I mean everyone.  Shut up. 
[00:33:00]  They kept their pretty little mouths.  Shut.  You got a pretty mouth.  Yeah, that was about it.  So there's no real reason to worry about that little situation today, right?  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't sweat it.  Andrew's saying the cops are going to kick Earl out of Staten Island.  Andrew!  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, for one, he, like, just pulled off the expressway.  And Hooters is the first place off the expressway.  So he didn't even, like, kind of figure it out.  He's just saying, this is good enough for me. 
[00:33:30]  And that's all the way at the, like, right by the Verrazano.  So a good 20 minutes from the other end.  So the lazy F, he goes, all right, I'm officially in Staten Island.  Yeah, officially, technically.  Technically.  Yeah, exactly.  You should go, like, to Newdop Lane.  Is there a place he could go where he could take care of, you know, three boroughs at the  same time?  Because he would do that if he could.  Well, thank God Staten Island's not that big.  All right, Andrew, we'll figure it out as we go.  Come to go to Newdop Lane. 
[00:34:00]  And it's right in the middle.  All right.  Easy for everybody.  All right.  I'm surprised they didn't just stop in the middle of the Verrazano.  Yeah, I'm kind of there.  Sure, why not?  Oh, Anthony, it's time for another country favorite.  Oh, what do you got?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Here we go, here we go.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.

That one's from Steve from FoundryMusic.com and Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I threw a blank for a second.  Jimmy, who puts together a lot of the great production for our radio show. 
[01:00:00]  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  2-1-2-757-1027 is our phone number.  Earl keeps calling in.  We know he's there, right?  What now?  Earl.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  We're at Hooters on Island and Clothes.  Come on.  Earl, we know that already.  We know.  How's it going, Earl?  It's going great.  Got a steady stream of cars.  They're just making the big U-E and wheeling around and getting their stickers and driving  right back out.  And you felt like you had to call us to tell us that, right? 
[01:00:30]  They told me to call back.  I called back.  Nigga, please.  Stay out the bushes.  All right, Earl.  I don't know.  I give up.  I surrender.  You've got.  You won.  We're not trying to win.  I'm sorry?  Trust me.  We're not trying to win this one.  Yeah, really.  This is like Michael Jordan playing wheelchair basketball. 
[01:01:00]  And the Staten Island cops say hello.  They love you guys.  And everyone says you're going to come out to Staten Island.  Be more funny.  Be more funny.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  But we'll be here for about another half hour, sir.  Are you some kind of moron?  No, I'm not.  Earl, why are you leaving in a half hour?  Okay.  How long do you want me to stay, guys? 
[01:01:30]  You've been there five minutes so far.  No, we've been there since the quarter of the four.  Howdy, faggot.  Well, you've got to give people a chance to get there and get out of work, that type of thing,  you know?  Okay, give me a time, guys.  What are you going to do?  You're going to come back here and do what?  Oh, I'm asking.  No one told me where to go, and no one's giving me a time when to get there and when to leave.  You're a titill.  A moulinian.  I heard a little rage in your voice, Earl.  There's a charcoal, okay?  Come on, sir, moulin.  Moulin, moulin.  Do what it said.  Earl, are you all right? 
[01:02:00]  How are you?  I'm fine.  You fine?  No problemo.  Now we're having fun.  You son of a bitch.  Earl, people are treating you nice, right?  Yeah, they're great.  They love you guys out here.  No, but they're taking care of you, right?  Yes.  Are the Hooters girls coming out to say hi?  Yeah, a couple popped out and said hello.  Okay.  And the manager of Hooters offered us some food, which we'll probably take on my phone before we leave. 
[01:02:30]  I got it from a Negro.  All right.  Well, Earl, have fun, okay?  Yeah, we're having a ball.  Just let me know how long you want us to stay here.  We'll stay here.  I figured you'd stay a little while today.  It's a nice day.  You might meet new people.  Make some friends.  Okay.  No, you've got plenty of friends here.  You're welcome to cook with me.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Okay, we'll stay for a while.  Help me. 
[01:03:00]  Help me.  You think you could stay until 5 o'clock, Earl?  We'll stay until 5 o'clock.  I'm just upset that no one really kind of gave me a direction on this.  No one told me where to go, so I kind of randomly picked a spot.  And then now you're telling me I didn't know how long to stay.  Earl?  Yeah.  What would Malcolm do?  What would Malcolm do?  He'd probably start looting, but that's just me.  What would Malcolm X do?  Oh, I thought you meant Malcolm in the middle.  What would Malcolm X do?  He didn't wait for people to tell him what to do. 
[01:03:30]  He just did it.  He got things done.  He is one of your heroes, right?  He's one of them, yeah.  Start of March.  Start of March.  I'm on the wrong side of Staten Island for that.  All right, Earl.  So it's Highland Boulevard and Clove?  Yeah, right off of Clove.  I believe Clove Road.  We're right in the Hooters parking lot.  Giving out the WOW stickers today.  They're handing out WOW stickers.  It's a beautiful day.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Earl's having a blast. 
[01:04:00]  TJ.  Thank God for you guys and WOW.  Why?  That's all I want to say, man.  I was up on 110 on the LIE, and this hot black girl, you know, I didn't even have a WOW sticker  on my truck because I worked for a faggot who let me put one on the truck, you know?  Yeah.  But I still, I rolled up on this chick who had a WOW sticker on her car.  I asked her if she would WOW us, and I had to get her into it, but she WOWed us, and it  was fantastic.  All right.  Cool. 
[01:04:30]  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks, TJ.  Bye.  You've got to love the WOW stories.  Yeah.  No, we know the WOWing is going on.  Yeah, we don't need the...  Happens all the time.  I'd like to hear from the ladies.  Yeah, that's always nice.  That's always cool when we know where the ladies are and, you know, and where they're  WOWing, I know, I needed to go to Andrew.  I got distracted.  Listen to Andrew.  Andrew.  How you doing?  Hey, when Al's driving around, why don't he just throw the WOW stickers out the window?  He'll get the same effect.  That way he would not be working as hard as he is now.  Over and out, Aquaboy. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Aquaboy.  Earl figured he'd stay at 20 minutes.  That's his WOW stickers.  20 minutes.  Just fling him out the window.  He might as well.  Just throw him out as he goes.  Thank you so much.  He's too effing much.  I know this is like deja vu for everyone, but nothing changes around here.  These are the exact same phone calls we did last year.  I know.  All the time.  Earl figured he'd throw us a bone and stay a half hour.  Half hour.  What the hell?  All right.  Making my way back. 
[01:05:30]  Just got here.  Gonna leave.  It's warm with that guy.  Thank you, Earl.  Thanks for helping us out.  William liked the road like breadcrumbs, so he can find his way back.  Yeah.  We'll just follow the sticker trail back.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Julie wants to say something about Whippamout Wednesday.  Yes, Julie?  Or July?  Or what's your name?  I'm Julie.  You're what?  Julie.  Stop.  All right.  Let's slow down.  Stop.  Julie. 
[01:06:00]  Julie.  Yes.  From Rocking County.  Julie, you got one of those voices, I must say.  It's kind of in between.  It's kind of stuck in the middle there.  Oh, thank you very much.  Got a little of the female.  Got a little of the male.  You're not a...  Oh, my God.  You're a girl?  Yes, I am.  I'm totally female.  It's Pat.  It's Pat.  How are you guys doing today?  Yeah, I was just driving home.  And this guy has this piece of paper with the wow sign written on it.  I mean, how gay is that?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on. 
[01:06:30]  Hold on.  Stinky, what happened?  Earl calls up and goes, tell them to get another driver.  And quickly hangs up.  Oh, he's mad now.  Get him on the phone.  What's wrong with Earl?  I think he does this for attention.  I think he wants to be a radio star or something.  He couldn't possibly be serious.  Let's get July back on the phone.  July.  Julie, whatever.  Yeah.  July.  Well, look how Stinky spells Julie.  Julie, J-U-L-Y.  Of course.  J-U-L-I-E.  July.  All right, July, what's up?  J-U-L-Y. 
[01:07:00]  Her name should be Jerry, right?  Yeah, Jerry.  All right, J-U-L-Y.  Calm down.  All right, so what?  Calm down.  Grandpa, calm down.  Calm down.  All right.  Are you hot?  With a voice like that.  Am I hot?  Um, well, I have a boyfriend who thinks so.  I never had a complaint yet.  You have the Joe Dirt hairdo.  Do I have a certain hairdo?  The Joe Dirt.  The Joe Dirt.  The Joe Dirt, no.  The big mullet.  No.  A little spiky on top.  I have very nice long blonde hair with a nice little flip in it. 
[01:07:30]  Yes, I'm very attractive.  You're not wearing an extra large Nantucket sweatshirt?  No, I'm not.  With a baseball cap on?  Nope.  All right, so what do you want to say about WOW?  I mean, like, it's cool.  This one guy, he was, like, in the car next to me, and I was about to WOW him with his  truck, like, going 20 miles an hour, and he just, like, speeds past me.  I'm like, where are you going?  Okay.  I was totally dying.  All right.  Now I know exactly what you looked like.  Jesus. 
[01:08:00]  The guy's avoiding you.  No, he's not.  He was trying to go slow, but his truck is going 20 miles an hour in a 50-mile-an-hour  zone.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not going to do anything.  All right.  Well, you would have WOWed, though.  I would have, yeah.  Why not?  All right.  You know, you can't stop anyone from doing that.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  There's Julie.  Which makes a lady die sound hot.  Oh, you just opened a can of worms there.  Tony.  What's up, boys? 
[01:08:30]  Hey, boys.  Ten bucks, these two bills.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, be kind to the butterhead over there.  Hey, Tony.  Yo.  So, which radio show here at WNAW do you like the best?  You guys, you know that.  Of course.  I didn't call anybody today.  Because we only hear you on every, every radio show.  Oh, Jesus.  You got that very distinctive voice.  I know.  And you start, doesn't matter what radio show.  Hey, boys.  All right.  What's up, fellas?  All right.  What do you got, Tony?  Dude, L-I-E. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  Going Long Island bound.  Two hot blondes.  Wowage.  Wowing like crazy?  They got any guts.  Tell them to call in, man.  They're both packing.  Whoa.  All right.  Cool.  Whoa.  Thank you.  You know what I'm talking about, right, Anthony?  Tony, I got to go because now it seems that Earl at the sticker stop is just throwing stickers  at everyone.  Uh-oh.  John, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey.  You doing hey?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  I just passed by.  I saw Earl.  They handed me a stack of about 15 of them. 
[01:09:30]  I was wondering if he gets out of there as soon as he's finished giving them all out.  That's what he's doing.  He's like those guys that hand out the strip club flyers on the road, like when you're walking  down the sidewalk.  Yeah.  It's just, hey, here.  I get rid of them.  I get to go home.  I'm not complaining at all, but, you know.  All right.  He's not handing them out nicely, huh?  No.  Well, the girl's pretty hot hand in the mouth, though, so good job, guys.  That's what we're hearing.  All right, John.  Keep it up.  Bye.  And Joe finally at the sticker stop.  We can't get Earl on the phone?  No.  He lets us.  His phone is on, but he just won't answer. 
[01:10:00]  I just called like 10 times.  So he sees it, and it shows up.  So he knows we're calling on his little call ID, but now his new trick is he's not answering.  All right.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah.  Oh, and hey, Earl needs Prozac, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Thanks.  Jesus.  All right.  It's the same thing as last year.  This guy cannot handle the pressure of driving somewhere and handing stickers out.  Oh, oh.  Too much pressure.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  We got to take a break.  This might be him calling back in.  We have to take a break.  Jay Moore coming by.  Earl handing out wow stickers for the next seven minutes, it looks like.  Throwing them at you at this point.  He's going to put in some OT and stay for seven more minutes?  Yeah.  Highland Boulevard and Kloff.  Yes?  Teenager girl?  Jay Moore's coming.  Yeah.  You want to flash this again?  Here, he's coming down the hall.  He's coming down the hall. 
[01:11:00]  It's all dirty.  Stay away from him.  All right.  We got to take a break.  No doubt.  All dirty's here.  Jay Moore on the way.  Some teenage nymph showing her boobs to everybody.  Doesn't she kind of look like Tiffany?  Remember Tiffany from years ago?  Yo, yo.  If her hair was red, yeah.  It's kind of got a tint to it, though.  I can see it in the face.  It's kind of like a red tint to it.  Right?  Am I high?  I can see it a little bit.  Yeah.  Also, when we get back from break, we'll talk to you in a minute, O.D.  O.D.  I found something. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  I've been looking for this for about a year.  A lot of people think I'm the sickest F on this radio show, and I've been telling you  guys that Anthony is just as sick, if not sicker.  Will you have your call where you told the little kid there was no Santa, and then, of  course, who could forget Bill?  Well, you know what?  We'll play Bill's Dead.  Okay.  And then we'll play the one I found of you, and we'll have people compare the two, and  they can decide who's sicker.  Which is more disturbing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because you're not as nice as you come across, my friend. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, wow.  Let's see.  You know the call I'm talking about right there.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I know.  We'll leave it up to the listeners.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony present the best in reality programming, starting next Monday.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  No tribal council.  No trail sergeants.  Just hot bodies and cool whipped cream.  Ladies, all you need to do is show up at WNEW between 3 and 7.  You bring the body, we bring the whipped cream.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Only from O.P. and Anthony.  Never.  Do we just link. 
[01:12:30]  1027.  WNEW.  Man, we're in the middle of a break, but we've got to break in really fast here.  Charlie.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I've got enough stickers for more.  I'll do my own sticker stop.  Where should I go?  Earl's treating the sticker stops like Amway.  He's like the distributor now, and he just has to give bulk to the people.  And they'll go out and do their own sticker stops.  All right.  Where are you right now?  Tyson Island.  Why don't we have the listeners just do a sticker stop?  Yeah.  Go back and tell Earl that you'll take care of the sticker stop. 
[01:13:00]  Grab all the stickers and then tell us where you're going to be.  Can I take the intern, too?  Yeah.  It'll be Charlie's Wow sticker stop.  Wherever you want to go.  All right?  Good.  Talk to you later, guys.  All right.  One guy needs some feedback.  You know, don't kill the messenger, okay?  He writes, Earl is handing out Wow stickers like a monkey throws feces.  Oh, my God.  Can we get Earl on the phone to work this out?  He seems like he's really...  Working on it, sir?  Hey, what's up?  Mike.  Yo, guys.  What's up, man?  What's up?  All right.  Earl is the most miserable F I've ever met in my life. 
[01:13:30]  Why?  You were just at the Wow sticker stop?  Yeah.  I'm standing right in front of him.  He doesn't even turn around and say hi.  The girl's throwing out like, I got 20 stickers here.  You only need two.  I only need two.  How many stickers he's given out?  Highland Boulevard in front of Hooters there on Clove, right?  He's so miserable.  Quick before he runs his head over with the van.  Mike, could you give her all the phone?  Hold on a second.  I've got to walk over there.  Because he will not answer his phone for some reason.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Who is this girl, anyway?  An intern.  It's our new intern.  Oh, she's cute.  Hands off.  All right.  All right.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl just quit again.  Earl, someone on the phone wants to talk to you.  He won't pick up the phone.  Oh, no.  Earl.  He won't pick up the phone. 
[01:14:30]  Tell him it's Jeremy.  Jeremy wants to talk to you.  He says no, screw him.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry.  Hey, Mike.  Yo.  Tell Earl to please get on the phone or we're going to give out his cell phone number.  They say get on the phone or they're going to give out your cell phone number.  All right.  All right.  No, he won't do it.  How about the home number?  How about your home number? 
[01:15:00]  It's far away.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Wow.  Did we lose Earl again?  I don't even think we did anything bad today.  Has he quit again?  How many times this year has he quit?  This year, it's been low.  Last year, he quit a lot.  He quit at least six or seven times.  Yeah, this year only, I think, twice so far.  If it wasn't for that stupid EOE thing, we'd let him quit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my good gosh. 
[01:15:30]  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yes, we love it.  We're down there all the time.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  You know, we don't need comedy writers like other radio shows because our listeners do all the work for us.  What now?  John on line three.  The weight of the stickers lifted my truck in the air.

They didn't just catch Joey out in Mastic, did they?  Was that Joey that was out there in Mastic Beach?  In the apartment?  Yeah.  Shacked up?  Having the kinky sex?  I'm just wondering because I haven't seen Joey in a while.  We haven't heard from him.  Joey is not the nephew of that gangster that was gunned down.  No? 
[01:16:30]  All right.  The famous picture of the gangster in the...  I think it was the Post at the time.  Yeah, it's in one of the papers today also.  A nice close-up of that guy just all shot up to pieces.  Giganti, right?  I think that was him.  With the cigar still in his mouth.  Yeah, and all the holes in his head.  No, Joey not related to that guy.  No.  Well, I'd love to see Joey at some point.  Ask for Joey if you see him down there.  You get a glass of wine in the house.

I go look at Earl.  I go, yo, Big Dick Black, how you doing?  He's like, you just gave me this look and looked away.  He's in his own.  He's like staring at the ground.  He don't want to be a part of nothing, this guy.  Jeremy, start an Earl chant.  He needs to feel good about himself.  Yeah.  We got to get a couple more people down here.  We'll get a Big Dick Black chant going.  What do you say, then, boys?  No, no.  Earl, Earl, Earl.  All right.  Make it up, boys.

I thought Wednesday would never come.  Oh, okay.  Guess who was on my flight on the way out here?  Who?  Jason Sehorne.  Nice.  And Alec Baldwin.  Nice.  Oh, yeah?  And I thought, if this thing goes down, my name won't even be in the article. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, no.  That's right.  You've got to think that.  You always look around first class and go, all right, I'm going to get a good run.  There's no one here.  That kid was on DIC or something, I think, but they're not going to mention him.  He's going to get a good run.  You're thinking, well, headline.  I'm the only guy.  Yeah, right.  You've got Alec Baldwin, like a big sleeping bear, behind you.  And Sehorne's like talking to me.  And he, oh, you want to hear something that was funny that happened on the plane?  Yeah.  No, Jay.  It's a comedy show.  Why don't you go outside?  Yes, jackass. 
[01:19:30]  You must be jet-lagged.  Oh, so Jason Sehorne's talking to me about his wife, Angie Harmon, leaving that show,  Law & Order.  What's it called?  Is it Law & Order?  I don't even know.  It is Law & Order.  And Baldwin is two seats away, and he's sleeping.  Alec Baldwin, by the way, is one of the funniest guys in the world.  And he's laying on his side, like, sleeping.  Like, we didn't really say hello to him, you know?  Yeah.  And he goes, well, you know, she thinks that the character's had its run, and Sehorne talking  about his wife.  And, you know, the way the character is, she thinks she's really maximized it, and it's  time to move on and go on to bigger and better things, you know? 
[01:20:00]  But it's a good thing for her.  And Alec Baldwin rolls over, and his hair's all messed up.  He's in, like, a sleeping shirt, you know, like a little big sleepy shirt.  And he's like, you want to know when she decided to leave the show?  The second she met you.  And then he rolls over and goes back to sleep.  Oh.  He rolls over and goes back to sleep.  That's great.  He's getting, like, a divorce or something, right?  Yeah.  So he's probably really bitter, and he just heard, like, yeah, she's doing great. 
[01:20:30]  You know, when you signed that $6 million a year contract, that's when she decided to  walk out of that show.  She's like, screw working.  I don't have to do this anymore.  Oh.  Boy, that first class must be nice, huh?  You look around, you see some celebrities, and you go, hey, I'm one, too.  I won $400 in first class.  We had cockfights.  It was a big cockfight.  Rolling dice in the aisle.  Here come the emails.  Great.  Roulette table.  On my flight back from Atlanta.  Wait, wait.  Did you get any dirt from Alec?  No.  Because wasn't he banging Jennifer Love? 
[01:21:00]  I honestly have no idea, and I wouldn't have asked.  You've got to ask.  Jennifer Love, you and you?  He's a big bear.  Like, dude.  He's a big dude.  Like, you don't want to get in his business, because he's kind of like a crazy Irishman.  He might not.  He'll knock you out.  Yeah.  I mean, he might stab you with a knife.  And now he's all nasty because of the divorce.  Right.  Because I'm sure she's trying to soak him.  I was in Atlanta doing Georgia Tech, and I flew back, and right when the Masters was going  on, it was the day after the Masters, and I'm flying back, and it's Jim Gray sitting  behind me, and in the first row of this Delta, like, piece of crap plane with seats that 
[01:21:30]  are garbage was Eldrick Woods, Tiger's father.  Mm-hmm.  He's in the first row.  Oh, no.  Like, hey, Tiger, why don't you let the old man borrow the Lear Jet?  Right.  The guy's just sitting there like he can't put his backpack under the seat in front of  him because there is none.  It's like that little fake wall with carpet on it.  What a bastard.  And he's just sitting there sleeping, like, and he's this big fat, like, Jabba guy, and  he's, like, just overflowing in this chair, and he's just, and then I look, and his mother 
[01:22:00]  was next to me, and she's got, like, literally, like, a million dollars of diamonds on her  fingers.  You've got to think they've got the private jet by now.  You're eating the same nasty-ass chicken I'm eating, honey.  That's got to make you feel good, right?  Why doesn't Tiger put him up in, uh...  The guy's got a $100 million endorsement deal, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not to mention winning everything.  Yeah, and that's like, golf is, like, the least of his income.  Oh, his income, sure.  Yeah.  Hey, we've got to go back to the phones real fast.  I'm sorry.  Not to interrupt Jay Moore, but Earl is not quitting. 
[01:22:30]  He's out of sticker stuff.  Uh, Earl?  Hello.  Earl?  Yeah.  That sounds happy.  Hey, Earl, you sound happier now.  No, I'm like, I'm, guys, I'm just sick as a dog.  I'm sorry.  He always has an excuse.  He's sick now.  You're sick.  So you decided not to quit?  I never said I quit.  You told Stinky you were quitting.  No, I said, I said, find another driver.  Well, wouldn't that mean you're quitting?  That is not quitting.  I'm just saying, everyone is obviously not happy with my performance with the van, so I said, 
[01:23:00]  find another driver.  Jay, check this out.  Earl is doing a wow sticker stop today.  He decided he's going to put in a good 30 minutes today.  No, I said, I was told to do an hour.  Why are you being so shifty?  Hey, where are the white women at?  I was told to stay here for an hour.  Well, I called 45 minutes into the sticker stop a second time.  When the white man talks about an hour, that would be 60 minutes. 
[01:23:30]  I said, 45 minutes in, I called in again, and I said, we're going to be here for another  half an hour.  And that was 45 minutes into the sticker stop.  All right, Earl.  But you're happy again?  I'm fine.  What are you sick with, Earl?  I've got a bad stomach.  Is it AIDS?  No.  Jesus.  Are you sure?  Positive.  Because you wear black, and it makes you look very slimming.  But now you look very slim. 
[01:24:00]  Do you have diarrhea?  No.  Well, if it's your stomach, and you don't have diarrhea, then you're vomiting.  Well, that's part of it, yeah.  When did you vomit?  Where and when was the last place you vomited?  My bedroom.  Oh, really?  Why didn't your bathroom go out on your way to the sticker stop?  Jeez.  That's not the virus.  Oh, you all right?  I'm fine.  Yeah.  That's the virus.  Time to set the rainforest. 
[01:24:30]  All right, Earl.  We've got to go.  But I'm happy to hear that you're not quitting after all, okay?  I never said I was quitting, as I said again.  All right.  Hey, Earl, you know what's going to happen?  If they're not happy with how I drive or how I do the sticker stuff, find someone else.  That's all I said.  All right, Earl.  And do your job, Earl.  We love you, Earl.  You know that, okay?  Yes.  All right.  You know what you do, Earl? 
[01:25:00]  Uh-huh.  I have a feeling what's going to happen.  If we have another softball game, I bet Opie, if this pitcher, is going to dot you right  in the back.  He probably would.  He's great.  He was our best player last year.  He was great.  He looked like Alfonso Soriano.  There you go.  All right, Earl.  All right.  Highland Boulevard and Clove in front of Hooters in Staten Island, handing out the wow stickers,  okay?  Get there quick, because the blackheads are going home early.  Get in the golfers.  All right, Earl.  All right, Earl.  Bye.  Day is never kidding. 
[01:25:30]  Master got me working.  Sunday master set me free.  Cartman, always funny.  John.  Yeah.  I was just going to say that Earl's sticker stops pretty soon.  They're going to be like the Berlin Airlift.  He's just going to drive by, and little parachutes are going to shoot out the back of the van with  wow stickers tucked at him.  Not a good idea.  Propaganda.  Very crafty idea there, sir.  Oh, crafty.  You guys suck.  Have a good one.  Thank you, John. 
[01:26:00]  That was crafty.  Who's your friend?  Oh, it's my best friend, Walter.  He's a good buddy of mine from L.A.  What's up, Walter?  What's up, guys?  He's the guy I needed the tape of when Dice and George were on the phone, and we went  to Paris.  Yeah.  That's the faggiest thing I've ever said.  When I needed the tape, he's my best friend.  Remember, we went to Paris.  Oh, how's that for a popper?  Oh, so we went to his wife and my wife were friends. 
[01:26:30]  Me and him were friends.  So anyway, I got him the tape of the show.  Yeah.  And he's, like, completely down to show.  He loves the show.  So he's in from L.A.  So does he smile, though, or...?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right, cool.  You look a little scary.  Well, he was in here talking about, complaining about first class.  Yeah.  When we fly together, I always fly coach.  Oh.  And I'm in the back with some Mexican lady clipping her toenails, and he didn't friggin'  believe me.  And he's in first class.  All right, so he comes back there with the, you know, apple cider champagne.  What the...  Look at this.  It's flat.  And I'm sitting there, and the lady goes, clink, clink. 
[01:27:00]  It's hitting me in the eye.  You friggin'...  Hey, go kill yourself.  What did she say to you?  Like, did you say something?  Oh, and he brought me back.  He goes, there's a lady clipping her toenails.  I go, that's impossible.  Like, there's no way that could happen.  Oh, room-wise.  That's real.  Kind of hard to get your foot up to.  Yeah, but he said she weighed, like, 300 pounds.  And it looked like, like, on Jerry Springer, like, when a woman becomes a man or a man becomes  a woman, I couldn't really tell.  She had, like, a Raider hat on and a Raider jacket and skinned like Bryan Adams. 
[01:27:30]  No, I'm not kidding.  She had her shoes off, and she hit me in the eye with those bamboo toenails.  And her breath smelled like a horse hoof.  He's on fire, Ross.  Like a horse hoof.  Freaking, what did you say to her?  I said, hey, look, freak.  I like that.  I, I, he, he, he.  No, no, I don't understand English.  You understand this in your mouth?  No.  Let's go to Dirk.  Dirk. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  I'm not sure if you saw that, uh, that, uh, video of the umpire getting hit in the face  with the ball.  Yeah, you see that?  I heard about it.  That's a great clip.  Oh, you want to see the clip?  That is a great clip.  Bring that up for me.  I got to find it, yeah.  I got to find it, yeah.  I got to find it, yeah.  I got to find it, yeah.  I got to find it, yeah.  I got to find it, yeah.  What?  Yo.  A second basement deep in the hole.  I was thinking, my man outside, uh, was telling me, his, his, his, I guess his girlfriend's  wowing everybody tonight?  Yeah, she's a teenager.  Oh, yeah.  He started dating her when, um, she was 14 and he was 17?  I want to bang her real bad.  Yeah.  I want to bang her.  Yeah.  She's fine.  She loves you, so we're going to bring her in in a second here. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, God.  She got jungle fever?  I don't want to.  She might have that jungle fever.  I just got in town, a brother with mine having a little something-something.  Did she wow you?  Yeah.  We're all the white women.  Did she wow you yet?  No, I was keeping it cool because I really like this one.  All right, well, bring her in, okay?  Want to take a break again?  Yeah, let me look for this clip.  We got to find the clip.  Hey, Caroline's this week.  Thursday, Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to say O.B. and Anthony on Regis tomorrow.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Oh.  We just found out we will not be joining Jay. 
[01:29:00]  No, but I said you can come in my car with me.  Okay.  Because they don't want any guests.  Jay hosting, uh, Regis and Kelly tomorrow with Kelly.  Kelly Ripper.  That ought to be cool.  Kelly's fine.  I just don't see it, though.  Kelly's fine?  She's 11 months pregnant.  What's wrong with you?  No, you've been pregnant.  I hit that.  Hey, older, are you what?  You said Kelly's fine.  Kelly is fine.  He'd hit that.  She looked good before she got pregnant.  She'd look good when she's pregnant, too.  I hit that.  She's all baby, too.  She's 26 months pregnant.  26 months. 
[01:29:30]  No doubt.  What, she's giving birth to an elephant?  Nice.  Nice.  All right, old girl.  And your body's popping up.  I like mommy.  Yeah.  Ass is a little large for the brother.  And I like him large, too, yo.  Well, her ass is flat and wide.  You're watching Black Forum.  I like my joint like an ice cream scoop.  Yeah, oh, no doubt.  No doubt.  I'll put my blast on that.  Oh, yeah, no doubt.  Yeah, I like perspectives.  Old Dirty, you like the L.A. brother?  Yeah.  You don't have an East Coast, West Coast thing going on?  No, I'm from New York. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  You got the Raiders stuff on?  Oh, because it was free.  Oh.  Brother, don't turn down a free swisher.  I need free.  Stay tuned for...  I'll wear your swisher to be Opie and Anthony.  I'm free.  All right, free is free.  Free.  Free.  Okay.  We'll take the break.  We'll show Jay the video.  We'll bring the teenager in to our Jay.  I'm in love with that girl.  And we also have two...  I've got a problem.  Well, we're going to get into that next.  We have two sick clips, Jay, for you to listen to.  Ant and I, how do you explain this? 
[01:30:30]  Well, it was a couple of calls we did when we were up in Boston, and Opie's always getting  the rap that he is the sickest, twisted bastard as far as being cruel to people, and  I did one thing that might be interpreted as being a little distasteful, and I finally  found out.  It's never been played in New York, so...  My heart's a flutter.  Yes.  It's...  In anticipation.  It's called a radio tease, Jay.  It's a radio tease.  Oh, so that's what's going to happen when we come back.  Yeah.  So who would change the dial?  Well, if they do, they're stupid, because what if you, like, hear some song, like, Kajagoogoo, 
[01:31:00]  ha, ha, hush, hush, ha, and you start singing along, because you always do when you're  along, because you're a fag, and then all of a sudden you're like, oh, Opie and Anthony,  I forgot, and then you go back, and it's like...  And you missed it, right?  You're like, oh, man, that's right, they told me that they were going to do that.  Right.  And then you're bummed for the rest of the day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So stick around.  All right, this is Otto, this is George of Otto and George, and you're listening to  O and A on any W, suck, nice, you, losers.  Frank from Manhattan on the instant feedback.  Uh, my God, somebody call 911, O and A have been kidnapped by the Black Panthers. 
[01:31:30]  What?  Keeping it real in Manhattan.  Thanks, Frank.  Uh, Anthony.  Keeping it real.  Pinnacle horny goat weed.  Hey, just when you thought you were hurt at all, here comes the pinnacle horny goat weed.  You know what this is all about.  It's an herb.  Comes from China.  No one knows what it's all about is, uh, the man sitting here right there.  I forgot, we have a testimonial right here in the studio.  Old dirty.  No doubt.  You're still doing the pinnacle horny goat weed?  Yeah, every now and then when I feel a little sluggish, when I can't put the transmission in first, 
[01:32:00]  your horny goat weed does it, kid, no doubt.  And you, uh, you take it, and what happens?  Well, you gotta wait a little while for the body to absorb all the chemicals.  Right.  You know what I mean?  But once, once the absorbation starts, and the matriculation of the chemicals gets into  your bloodstream, it's over, dude.  It's over?  You're just, uh.  At least two nuts.  At least two nuts.  At least.  It used to be three.  What happened?  Oh, it'd be at least two nuts.  At least two nuts.  Well, if you're, like, sluggish and take the goat weed, then you're good for two. 
[01:32:30]  But if, but if you like, you're good, and then you take the absorbation of the corny  goat weed, so you're talking three on your own, plus three on the goat weed.  So that's three to the third power, dawg.  Right.  It's fucking sick.  You know, it must be so, it must be so cool to be unemployed, man.  Three to the third power.  Fucking sick.  How cool is it to be unemployed, to be able to, like, get your F on all day long? 
[01:33:00]  Awesome.  No doubt.  It'd be great.  In real.  Hey, uh, quick observation.  Yes, sir.  You're, you're starting to look more and more like Hitler with that mustache.  Man, man, y'all, y'all, I need some scissors.  I slipped it up, man.  You went from Billy Dee Williams.  No, I had, yo, check it.  Hey, Walt, he used to have, like, a Billy Dee Williams thing happening.  Yeah, man.  A real thin pencil mustache.  I had the, I had the first hour of the day, right?  So then I decided, yo, let me take a shower, because the sunshine was calling me, you know  what I mean?  So I shaved up nice, and my mustache was out to here.  Right.  So I had to try it.  On the real? 
[01:33:30]  On the real, Jay.  Dang.  So then I started trimming it, and then started going, you know, end to end.  You know what I mean?  And then, yo, this is the outcome.  You shaved too much.  You look a lot like Hitler now.  You got the Hitler mustache.  It ain't pop, black Hitler.  It ain't pop.  Hitler wrecked that mustache for everyone, didn't he?  Yeah.  Charlie Chaplin made it fun, and Hitler wrecked it.  There you go.  What happened?  And, oh, well, I got to get rid of this.  Why don't you do, like, a Raleigh Fingers thing?  Grow it out.  Yeah, like that?  Yeah.  The handlebar.  Like that?  Like that, yo.  No doubt.  Clown.  Are we done with the pinnacle horny goat weed? 
[01:34:00]  No.  Oh.  Bailey got into it.  I thought we got the testimonial.  You take, well, that's a good testimonial.  So, 1-800-899-5323.  If you want to be like OD and bust three to the third power nuts, which is six.  The horny goat weed makes me shoot like my Pearl Jam is all over the room.  1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle horny goat.  We get some today.  Hour, hour, hour, hour. 
[01:34:30]  By O.P. and Anthony.  Proving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  212-757-1027.  Hanging out with Jay Moore.  He's hosting Regis and Kelly tomorrow.  Guest hosting.  Regis is on vacation.  On vacation.  We'll all be checking that out tomorrow morning.  And Jay Moore will be at Caroline's all this weekend.  I'm leaving my show in the trustworthy hands of Jay Moore. 
[01:35:00]  I am easy.  Can we go?  Wherever I am, you can be good at.  I love it.  Call Caroline's for ticket info.  I don't know what's going on with the tickets for the Jay Moore show.  It's got to be close to a sellout.  Much like my old shows with Kathy Lee at Westbury Music Fair.  In the round.  I sing songs.  It would sell out with the Roots from the Midwest.  Did I do a show at Westbury Music Fair yet? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  How'd it go?  It was there last weekend.  Did it go good or not?  It was great, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not being serious.  I'm just saying it was great.  It was Pac, and there was a fight.  Have you ever done comedy in the round?  It's a little strange.  It's cool to see that.  I couldn't keep my fat ass away from other people.  It's in the round, you see?  So, well, I'm talking to people over here now.  Yeah.  And my ass is over here.  Jay, what are you saying?  I got a big ass? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  There was a funny moment because he was trying to do a callback from, you know, something  he did earlier in his act.  But he didn't know where the person was.  He was trying to point to the guy.  Because the stage is spinning.  So he was supposed to point.  Like, if you're on stage, you know the guy's stage left.  He's in the second row.  You go, like this guy over here.  Right.  He wanted to go back to it.  You know, something he did like 20 minutes ago.  A guy with beige pants.  So he's looking for the guy, and he didn't know where he was.  Like this guy, where the hell is he?  Right.  He's doing circles.  It's hilarious.  The stage spins? 
[01:36:30]  Well, it wasn't spinning that night.  No, it wasn't spinning.  But, you know, because it's in the round, he's moving around like, you know.  It only spins when REO Speedwagon's there.  I was going to say, what did he say, Tiny Dancer?  Right.  I saw Yes in the round once.  Really?  Rock.  Did you do Acid?  Pretty much.  Jeez.  I think it was Shrooms that night.  And the stage just slowly rotates.  Yeah.  He comes out, though.  Maybe he wasn't rotating.  He was Shrooms.  They told us he rotated.  Right.  He comes out like a diced superhero, the action figure.  He's got, like, these pants now that he wears.  These pants are ridiculous. 
[01:37:00]  You know, he's got these big, huge pants, but they're not, like, ghetto huge.  They're not baggy.  They just, the legs go straight down like two big tree trunks.  Like David Byrne in Stop Making Sense?  Yeah, but only their jeans.  They're like Dennis.  And they're huge.  It's the carpenter cut.  I like it.  Go to the gap.  It's the carpenter cut.  Here's the boot cut.  And then he's got the big leather jacket with the studs all over it. 
[01:37:30]  He's like, look, I'm a transformer.  I turn into a rocket ship.  It's unbelievable, this guy.  That's hilarious.  And then we get in a fight, or they get in a fight.  I had left beforehand at a previous engagement.  You got in a fight?  Well, it's not.  Rick and his wife and everything with this mullet-headed, Joe Dirt-looking chick that  was sitting two rows in front.  I did not expect the word chick to follow that mullet-headed, Joe Dirt-looking.  Oh, she was a chick.  And she had this bitch.  She was so obnoxious and so drunk.  Yeah, all drunk. 
[01:38:00]  She's trying to take pictures.  And then she's just like, eh, somebody told her to sit down and shut up.  And she wouldn't shut up.  And these guys told her to be quiet, and then she spit on Rick and Rick's wife.  Oh, I would have punched her in the mouth.  And Rick tried to.  Security came over, and then they're, like, holding her back.  So Rick just goes right up to her face and goes, yeah, you effing see.  Like, right there.  And then she goes, take a swing at Rick.  And security threw her, like, hey, speed.  It sounds like a great brawl.  It was a very fun time.  I'm sorry I missed it.  It was hilarious.  Drudge Jr. is on the phone, Anthony. 
[01:38:30]  I don't understand that type of people coming to a size show.  Drudge.  Hey.  Drudge Jr.  I just sent out some information on Christopher Walken.  Oh, you have info on Christopher Walken.  I'd love to hear it.  Well, a year ago he was in some sort of musical called Waking the Dead or something like that.  Where he was singing a really long song called Snow Falling to the Universe or something. 
[01:39:00]  It's down a lot of Napster.  It's the funniest thing you'll ever hear.  Jay, just to fill you in, this guy wants to be just, like, his hero, Drudge.  No, last time I was on, he called up.  Oh, that's right.  So this is, like, Drudge Jr.  He wears the hat and everything.  This isn't breaking news or anything, is it?  Well, I guess not.  I'm so sure some people saw it.  I thought you had a scoop for us.  This kid needs Paxil or something.  And every time you're on the phone, you tell her you're about to jump out a window.  Paxil.  Paxil.  No, it's not really breaking news after all.  It just sounds like Eeyore.  Hey, Drudge, what are you working on? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, no.  Well, um...  Don't I get in the coffin, kid?  What are you working on?  What are you working on, Drudge?  Well, the Pat Cooper thing.  Oh.  Fascinating, sir.  Can't say it on the radio, but...  Pat Cooper, hot seller.  Pat Cooper, huh?  Okay.  I was also thinking about maybe running for mayor.  You've got to be a certain age so you're out of the loop on that.  I think there's a pubic hair limit, sir.  I know I can't win, but I just think it'd be funny if I ran for mayor and I got a lot of votes. 
[01:40:00]  Can't run with less than eight pubes.  Get in the coffin.  Get in the coffin.  There's no auto in Georgia coming by.  He's so small, he pees on his nuts.  Oh, that's a good line.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Drudge Jr.  Who's doing the impressions here?  Is it Anthony or Jay Moore?  Ah.  Neither.  Otto and George are here.  And Christopher Walken. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, the studio's still.  Hey, don't forget Joe Pesci comes in here like a freaking broad role standing here waiting for everybody's talking to me.  I mean, in the lobby, some girl's like, you know, wow, what the hell are you going to wow, you stupid sea sucker, you know?  I'm standing here like a broad role, like a colored guy in a street corner, and you're standing there with your judge over here, you know?  I really got him going, you stuttering prick, eh?  Judge, when do you crawl for the report, Drudge?  What's his name?  Junior.  Drudge Jr.  Drudge?  Drudge.  Yes. 
[01:41:00]  In this day and age.  When do you go put your head in love and your balloon head Jesus?  I really like go, Jay.  Great piece of work.  That was good.  That was good.  It was horrible.  Are you being sarcastic?  Hey, look, I'd be willing to point out some horrible Jay Moore movies, but that was, go was a great movie.  Except for the lap dancing scene.  Why?  Because it's too sexy and with girls and vaginas in it?  Well, not any scenes you were in.  No, why was the lap dancing scene not good? 
[01:41:30]  I said that was good.  Well, you said except for the lap dancing.  The whole movie sucked except for the lap dancing.  Oh, is he?  That's what I'm thinking he was trying to do there.  The stripper in that scene was four months or five months pregnant.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Talk about needing some money for the pipe.  That's hot.  All right, Drudge.  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  No?  Wow, don't kill yourself.  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  Drudge, that's not your job on our show.  Your job is to get, you know, the scoops. 
[01:42:00]  Tell us what you're working on.  I thought that was a scoops.  You should download that song.  It's really funny to hear him sing.  All right.  Thank you.  Go ask Christopher Robin for some Ritalin.  All right, Drudge.  All right.  All right.  Now, this kid's just calling from the oven.  He's actually inside the oven on a little pan.  You like the Drudge Jr.  He's, what, 13, 14?  Yeah.  I'm going to go kill myself.  I'm going to go start my mom's car in the garage at the door down.  He's going to get a little older and look back and go,  I'm sorry, Drudge Jr. 
[01:42:30]  We all do.  Don't take a personally, Drudge Jr.  All right.  Well, we've got to play these clips.  Great.  All right.  Yes, yes.  I finally found a clip of Anthony that kind of proves that he's pretty twisted, too.  Yeah, it's quite of questionable taste, I admit.  But it's nothing like your Bill's Dead call.  Well, we can do the Bill's Dead, and then we'll do yours, okay?  All right.  Compare.  Have you ever heard Bill's Dead, Jay?  I've heard neither.  I'm looking at the computer with the people on hold.  Yeah, yeah.  And I can save us some time and energy.  Rob, yes, I'm going to play Rutgers. 
[01:43:00]  That's, I just read the screen, so.  When are you playing Rutgers?  Look, he just went away now.  When are you playing Rutgers?  I'm not sure, actually.  The 26th.  Black guy knows every day the payday comes.  Me's my money.  Yeah, 26th.  You'd chant.  You'd chant.  You'd sell me that karate, Elvis.  All right.  I got that white woman I got to pay for.  That's good.  Jay Moore, Rutgers.  He's also married to a white woman, and his baby looks like Johnny Morton of, like, the Detroit Lions. 
[01:43:30]  How is that, man?  He's married to a white woman.  Yeah, she's blonde.  She's like children of the corn, blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde, blue, blue, blue.  Nice.  She's an albino, sir.  My son's got blue eyes with brown skin.  He's going to be a good-looking kid.  Cool.  How you pump out supermodels like that, I swear to God.  Yeah, yo.  That's how the supermodels are born, right?  Yeah.  Girls out there, if you want some of this good sperm.  Yo, wait a minute.  I'm the one who got the sperm on sale.  You got filthy Puerto Rican sperm. 
[01:44:00]  Hold tight, baby.  No, Old Dirty is really selling his sperm, Jay.  Yeah, he's selling it.  I'm going to fill the earth with my seed, kid.  What's your...  Oh, my God.  I thought you were going to the adoption agency and pick up your Puerto Rican.  Here's your kid.  He had his crib lowered, and he's got dice hanging from his nuts.  They're just saving it up for when they could sell kids in vending machines.  Ah!  That's why pump them out.  What's wrong, Old Dirty?  Nah, and I'm seeing what Rick is writing.  What's your sperm per cc when you got it done? 
[01:44:30]  Well, I was shooting...  I spanked out loads, kid.  I don't know what cc is, man.  No, but you got to know how many active little guys you got.  Yeah, because I like to count.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  My cc is on jet skis, son.  That's crazy.  Come on.  Yeah, he's Puerto Rican.  Come on.  He's dropping them up at the doorknob.  They're zigging and zagging.  Crazy.  They're Puerto Rican, man.  Strong swimmers, dog.  Maybe he can help out Jay.  Jay didn't have a good count. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, why?  Yeah, it was a little rougher, Jay.  Maybe you got to eat some rice and beans, dog.  Rice and beans.  That's the trick.  And fried bananas.  There you go.  Jay went for the sperm count.  Word.  Yeah.  But like, what's that, though?  Like, they count how many thousands are going to make it into the final running?  How many millions?  How many are swimming and how mobile they are.  Yeah, how well they swim if they got two heads or 16 tails.  If one of them is going to swim.  Come on, man.  The nurse told me my whole posse was on jet skis. 
[01:45:30]  That's a good thing, then, right?  Would you go to the clinic?  She really said that?  Yeah, yo.  The clinic from good time.  Baby, your sponge is on jet skis, right on.  Dino mine.  I thought your hand flared up.  Damn, damn, damn, damn.  She told me, she told me that they were, like, there was a whole mad.  I didn't get the number, though, man.  They were just mad crazy, right?  Yeah, so jet skis.  They were mad at jays.  Jays are on a raft. 
[01:46:00]  Jays are on a raft.  Jays look like a castaway.  Jays came up with a little duke.  Jays sperm floating around on a raft trying to find the egg.  Holding martinis.  Pumping in at each other.  Punching some sperm.  Come on, sperm.  Smarten up.  There's hot teenage chicks running around this place.  Like, get it together.  And sniffers in their hands of bo-bo-bo-bo.  Come on.  Kelly Ripley, get it together.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  I heard OD's selling a sperm. 
[01:46:30]  I want to get some.  My female monkey wants to have a baby.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry, OD.  Later, guys.  He's Dominican.  I know who that was.  He's Dominican.  I know who that was.  Yeah, who was that?  Petey.  Petey.  Yeah, how are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Everyone's doing good.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, is this guy this old dirty?  Is he a Moulignan or is he a Reekan?  What is he?  Yeah, I ain't no Moulignan.  I'm the cat you come to buy your cocaine from, punk.  Look, pal.  Look, I ain't buying no cocaine.  What I understand is if you're not a Moulignan, why are you using all this, you know, mad crazy and mad ripe and all this BS? 
[01:47:00]  Because it's from the neighborhood he's in.  Yeah, that's right, man.  But if he's a Reekan, he's not going to talk like that.  He's going to, like, you know, use the Reekan terminology.  What is the Reekan terminology?  And what is it?  What?  If you're so adept at knowing what language I'm speaking, you know what it is then, punk?  I'm not privy to that militaristic information.  Why don't you, like, you know, malign the English language a little more here?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Come and get your Coke at six, man.  You're Dominican.  Is that the story you're trying to press or you're Dominican?  You're Dominican, loco. 
[01:47:30]  What's going on, loco?  Dominicano, so are you from, like, Washington Heights or what here?  Yeah, that's right.  Washington Heights, my brother.  What nationality or you, sir?  What nationality or you, sir?  What nationality?  I'm English.  I'm English.  You came in Italian and then you faded into black and then...  What makes you think I'm Italian?  Because you said, how you doing?  How you doing?  What?  Because I said, how you doing, you assume I'm Italian?  Is that it?  Why are you talking like you're from Brooklyn, dude?  I'm not from...  I'm not from Brooklyn.  What are you talking about?  You forgot to change your voice before you got excited?  Hey, Petey.  Petey, what are you about, man? 
[01:48:00]  What?  What are you about?  I'm not about anything.  I was just curious whether ODB was...  Bye, get in the coffin.  You talk to the channel.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye, Angley.  Who needs that?  I'm never going to England.  Andrew.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, O.D. is like the Puerto Rican Ralph Crandon.  He always has a get-rich-quick scheme.  I'm selling my sperm!  Alan Crandon!  Get your foot out of the handcuffs.  Get your foot out, Norton!  Alice, we are going to be rich.  Easy streets coming.  I'm selling my sperm. 
[01:48:30]  Get Mrs. Manacotti down here to give me a handy.  Alice, where are the pots?  I'm selling my sperm.  Where are the pots?  Start whacking, Norton.  Alice, where's the sugar?  It's going to be late.  Get battered with sugar on it.  Where's the sugar, Alice?  I'll throw a batch and take you all to Hong Kong Gardens.  Bravo.  Oh, man.  You got to look for honey motors. 
[01:49:00]  Come on.  Now, we were going to play these clips.  Hey, Ralph, that's quite a load.  Oh, jeez.  I'm going to take them down to Mr. Marshall.  It's your squeeze play.  I'm Marshall.  I'm Marshall.  Father Sam, how would you like to buy the finest sperm you could purchase?  Don't answer yet, Father Sam.  Because I'm also going to give you the pot. 
[01:49:30]  Father Sam, you want my sperm?  It's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, I'm giving sperm in my pelophanies.  No more mambo.  I got to get cranking.  Did you take any sperm from Carlos?  Or were you just mamba dancing?  Whose sperm is in this club?  Carlos.  Ah, cocktail time, huh? 
[01:50:00]  Come on out, Ralph.  Harvey.  Harvey.  God, when he walks in and they just left.  You remember Harvey?  Yeah, they just left.  She's babysitting him.  They just left and they're having martinis.  So he comes in.  There's two martinis on the table.  The first thing he says, all right.  Ah, ah, oh, cocktail time, huh?  Ah, who?  Ah.  Where is he?  I'll tell him live for him.  You never been with a bus driver, huh? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, jeez.  That's great.  I didn't know Davey Crockett was so fat.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot of protein, huh?  Mr. Baby Batter.  See, that's mine also.  Baby Batter, that's mine.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  It's in the airbag, Babisham.  Don't leave anything for the cleanup crew. 
[01:51:00]  Sonny boy.  Back up.  Here he comes.  I had it.  We all had it.  Easy come, easy go.  I'll inseminate everyone.  Me a bag of shells.  The whole country's running around with Gleason.  Rob, sorry.  Cramden. 
[01:51:30]  It's got to work, Alice.  I'm dropping them off at the door.  I sound like Regis.  I can't take any of this.  That's great.  God damn.  We've got to shift gears.  The teenager wants to wow Jay.  Nice.  All right.  What was her name again?  Lusciousness.  Kelly?  Bring in the white women.  Nice.  Yeah.  Let me grab a coffee, too.  If I'm going to see breasts, I've got to get jacked up on the coffee.  Here's Shaq.  Kelly.  Kelly, I'm grabbing a coffee.  Don't do anything. 
[01:52:00]  You've got some red to your hair, right?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, see?  I'm getting a little Tiffany thing from you.  You've got a little Tiffany thing going on, people are saying.  Right?  That's good.  Before Tiffany got fat and ugly.  Right.  Right.  The young Tiffany.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Yo.  Can you call a sperm-cora apple?  Can you call a apple?  Shout out for the future.  Shout out for the future.  Yeah, you guys suck, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  Got to love Honeymooner references.  So, is Jay doing it for you? 
[01:52:30]  Jay's out of the studio right now.  He's hot.  He should come to my prom with me.  Oh.  Does your boyfriend get a little jealous because you're probably out there just talking about  Jay and how hot he is and stuff?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah?  Nice.  Nice.  Yes, he is.  He pays all my bills.  Nice to me.  He makes fun of me a little bit, though.  I'm a little stupid.  You're a little stupid.  You're a little stupid.  I didn't think that I am.  Yeah?  Oh. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  I drive bed.  All girls drive bed.  Yeah.  And the jinx, too.  All right.  So, well, Jay's going to come in and then what?  Should we take a break?  We probably should take a break.  Yeah?  Or is he coming back?  What's going on?  All right, Jay, come on back.  What happened?  We're setting her up for you.  I had to go put my wife's underpants in backwards because my nuts were hanging at the bottom.  So if you wear female underpants backwards, your nuts get caught up in, like, all that 
[01:53:30]  ass room.  And it's just like a G-string.  But when you wear, like, girls underpants, you know...  That's all.  It's like a trampoline, this time.  All right.  Yeah.  In case they dump out, Jay's wearing female underwear.  No, I'm not.  I'm wearing just some regular breasts.  All right.  Kelly's in love with you, Jay Moore.  She's a teenager.  She's 18.  There's some boyfriends out there ready to kill me.  He told me to put my pin-pan back in my pocket. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, really?  I was like, so what's going on?  He's like, put your pin-pan back in your pocket, fella.  Would you like to see Kelly's boobs?  Yeah.  Are they as good as the ones he saw in Cancun?  Oh.  Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that?  Well, everybody told us.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Sorry, because he told us that in private.  Yeah, I know.  These are good luck.  You trust them like that?  What?  You trust them like that?  Yeah, I did.  I went to Cancun, baby.  Wait, get out of the mic, old dirty. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I'll do it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's set this up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kelly's boyfriend went to Cancun for spring break.  21-year-old guy with all his friends and swears nothing happened.  Nothing happened.  Hey, Kelly believes it.  Kelly, 18-year-old Kelly, come along.  Let me tell you something.  Brother had, let me tell you, he's got babies running in Mexico.  He's not so big like that.  But he don't got to be all about that.  It drops in your lap.  No, because if you're with someone for so long, you have to be thankful.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, did you empty his weapon before he went on vacation? 
[01:55:00]  No, I don't think so.  You didn't send him in an unloaded state?  Are you a virgin?  No.  Oh, because you said, I don't think so.  Like, no way am I having sex ever.  She had sex with him when she was 14.  She was 14, he was 17.  You had braces and an A bra.  You just got hotter.  Right?  Yeah, I definitely did.  Do you have red pubic hair also?  No.  No?  What color is your pubic hair?  Brown.  Brown?  Can we play What's in Your Pants if you go in the other studio on the phone?  No. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  Oh, look at the boyfriend.  No, no, no.  Triangle?  What is it?  For the listeners, because they get so turned on.  What are you sports?  You're so beautiful.  Wow, your boyfriend's not as cool anymore.  Bare floor.  You got wood floor?  Oh, God.  Slippery slope.  Yes, the John Bonet Ramsey.  You know what I like about the wood floor is when I'm down there doing my business, it  makes me slide right into the anthill.  There's no asking for directions, Norton.  No asking.  Slip and slide, Norton.  Yo, baby, but let me tell you something. 
[01:56:00]  Cancun, this ass all over the place.  I know.  All right, let's see the brush.  All right.  There's so many people in here.  Yes.  All of them will enjoy.  That's a compliment.  Sometimes there are girls that come in here and the studio's empty.  That's how you leave.  I hope you leave.  Everyone leave.  That's how fine you are.  No, I'm not.  I already saw...  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Right?  Jesus Christ and God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Jesus and baby Jesus. 
[01:56:30]  Christ on a go-kart.  What was that?  Those are amazing.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  You want to be felt up by a movie star?  No, her boyfriend will freak out.  Oh, look.  You're considering it, though, right?  Kelly, you considered it, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  He's a scumbag if he pulls around with somebody in Mexico, but you don't mind me filling up  your breast pieces.  You're a little different.  I see you on TV.  Right.  It's different.  So it's okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  We have this thing. 
[01:57:00]  Like, you can say you like someone on TV.  He could be like, oh, Carmen Electra's hot.  But if he's like, oh, yeah, the girl in my class is hot.  But if he comes into Carmen Electra, is she allowed to, like, crank his junk?  But she wouldn't.  She's on TV.  But, Jay, she wouldn't.  That's it.  You're not helping me.  Let's make a deal with the boyfriend.  What do we got to give away?  Yeah, make a deal.  What's up?  He's leaving with you.  I don't know what you could possibly give him.  Hey, could Jay?  I want to go back to that Carmen Electra thing.  You're looking at me right now. 
[01:57:30]  Why can't I get Carmen Electra?  I'm just saying, like, it's a little hard.  Hey, she put Dennis Rodman in her mouth.  I think you got a shot.  I said that in my penthouse interview, and I mentioned you guys in my penthouse interview.  Thank you, Jay.  Wait, listen, listen.  You can get Carmen Electra.  Listen, will you let Jay fill up your girlfriend?  Or?  How about Walter?  Because you don't know him at all.  No, the colored guy can't touch her.  Because then that would be rave.  The colored puppet Rodman.  That would be rave.  Look, on the way home, have you ever slept with a black guy? 
[01:58:00]  What?  Have you ever slept with a black guy?  No.  She's only slept with him.  Only when I get real tan.  Somebody's not easy as it's her.  On the way home, they're going to be like, you know, you were really pointing them at the colored guy for a long time.  So what do you say?  Think of the story you'll have, man.  Three more.  Feels up.  I want you to do a free ticket.  Your girlfriend.  I want you to do whatever you want.  I want to Mexico.  Yeah, kid.  You see the way he gave you that?  Bet on the back.  That's a gig.  He's in the bathroom. 
[01:58:30]  That's like a year.  I went to Mexico, baby.  You know what I mean?  So you will.  Cigaline and hot garbage.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She's scooted over to J.K.  I have to tell you this.  I'm the type of guy, I wouldn't do it unless he was fine with it.  And if he's upset with it, I'm not going to do it in his face in front of him.  Well, of course.  Nah, brother.  It's straight.  You can go for it.  All right.  Come on, mama.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  There we go.  Hold on.  I want him to watch, though.  And J. Moore is now.  All right.  A little tweak.  Tweak it.  A little nip tweak. 
[01:59:00]  He's now rotate and now full grab.  Wow.  Oh, mama.  Skeeter.  How about that?  She gets...  Oh, she's loving it, kid.  Wow, yeah.  Isn't that good?  Is that good?  Look, I'm pulling on it.  I'm pulling on it.  Wow.  You like to be spanked, don't you?  Don't you?  You like to be spanked, don't you?  Wow.  That's why I had your nipples six inches away from your body.  Wow.  That was unbelievable.  Thank you.  Hey, Kelly.  How was that?  How was that?  Good sport. 
[01:59:30]  You like that?  The movie star touching my boobs.  No, but forget the movie star.  Some guy was just touching your boobs.  How did that rank?  Oh, it's not as good as having my boyfriend touch my boobs.  Good answer.  That was the political answer.  Good answer.  That was the political.  I know what she's lying.  Let's let the black guy have a try.  Have a tug.  Let OD take a tug.  Did you get a flow going?  Hey, Kelly.  Honestly, you're so pretty and those are like really perfect that I had like a flow going 
[02:00:00]  and I want to tell you if you did also.  Honestly.  A flow.  A flow.  Did you get that little feeling down there?  A little bit?  Did you get a little clip?  That's out.  Because they don't let that go through.  Was he the first guy that's touched your boobs since your boyfriend?  Ever?  No way.  The Padres.  No.  The Padres.  I'm joking.  Hey, Kelly.  You want to touch movie star Schween?  I can't do that, man.  I'm just asking.  Other people have touched your boobs?  Want to touch stuff?  Like on accident and stuff. 
[02:00:30]  Like not on accident.  But not just like that.  Just your boyfriend.  That's my busboy job.  Wow.  Sometimes it runs up against the table.  That's almost virgin.  That's almost virgin.  That was fantastic.  That's all I had before him.  That like turned me on.  Did you get turned on?  Not like in a cheat on your boyfriend way.  Yeah.  Like you're going home with them, you know, and I'm married, so.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was great.  That was hot.  Nice.  Nice.  That rocked.  Without a doubt.  Wow.  That was sexy.  Billy Hayes in the corner.  Hey, Ben, make sure they get a t-shirt for that. 
[02:01:00]  They already got two.  That'll go to my wardrobe.  That was for the first two.  Waltz, what's up?  I just want to know, what's this up?  Okay, terrific.  Where's that from?  From our radio show.  Okay, terrific.  I mean, I know it from your radio show, but where's the clip from?  From our radio show?  Oh, it's our voice guy.  Oh, your voice guy just going, okay, terrific.  There's no, like, uh...  No, he was in between doing some stuff for our station, and all of a sudden, Jimmy goes,  hey, we're done with you.  And he goes, okay, terrific.  He was just messing around, and we, I don't know, carded it up.  I got it.  All right, thanks, guys. 
[02:01:30]  No real great story there, but that's it.  Okay.  All right.  But wait a minute.  Why can't I touch the breasts?  This is, can you?  Because you're not a movie star.  I'm not a movie star.  Because he has jewelry on.  Walter knows a porn star named Fat Tracy.  Fat Tracy?  Yeah.  And?  So he's, like, kind of into the porno scene, so maybe he can touch him.  Yeah, he's kind of a...  He's a producer.  He's a producer of film.  Yo, you a producer?  Yo, dude.  My spermicide is on jet skis, kid.  Spermicide.  What the hell?  Even the spermicide is on jet skis, kid. 
[02:02:00]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Smoking on the rounds.  We've got to get a fire extinguisher for the back of his neck.  Walter, tell them.  You worked on Action and on Beyond the Glory.  He's a producer on Beyond the Glory.  Yeah, do you want a famous producer to tell you?  Do you want to pose nude ever?  Actually.  Uh-oh.  We should take some shots here, and we'll mail them to Penthouse, because you guys did  your interview at Penthouse.  We can mail them from here to Penthouse.  Walt would like to... 
[02:02:30]  What kind of...  No, I don't know.  That's the next step, right?  What kind of pictures do you want to do?  Check, one, two, check, check.  No, I mean, what kind of pictures would you want to do?  I don't know.  We'll make it.  I would do it.  Yeah?  I would do it.  Would you ever do, like, softcore porn, like a Showtime movie with, like, a guy grinding  on you, but no, like, insertion?  Yeah, soft porn.  All right, make...  You know what?  Why don't you go get pizza or something?  Because I think you're hampering these answers.  Oh, okay.  No, she has free range. 
[02:03:00]  Would you ever do an amateur porn with John?  Have you ever videotaped yourselves having sex?  No.  No, we haven't.  Would you?  Yeah.  Of course you would.  Yeah.  Would you allow it...  Would you sell it, like, to, like, you know, naughty amateurs or something, and then,  like, maybe become, like, a real star?  I would.  I don't know if he would want to.  Oh, so you've got a wild side.  You wouldn't mind becoming, like, a star, like, making millions of dollars, having sex?  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  Oh, you are the hottest thing on two wheels.  Are you into German fisting?  Yeah, I just got over 11. 
[02:03:30]  German fisting videos, yeah.  Hey.  Cartman's mom?  Yeah.  Freshman's mom?  Yeah.  Are we seeing her naked or what?  I think...  Let's take pictures and send them to penthouse.  Oh, look, he's like, nah, nah.  No, no, no, no, no.  Between me and you, you don't want to, you know...  Ah, she's got a friend.  Thank you.  So?  So you pulled out your screen.  That's what the appliances are for.  It keeps any riffraff from getting out.  Mm-hmm.  So who said we have to see the full Monty?  I don't know.  I can't believe it. 
[02:04:00]  Let's go finger paint.  You can have...  Oh, God.  No, you could, like, have her stand in a way  where you just see, like, the top of her, like, pubic hair.  You can see my new tattoo.  Where's your tattoo?  Right here.  I'll show you my new tattoo.  All right.  All right.  I think you need to pull your shirt off  to show us the tattoo.  Yay.  See, John's okay.  I don't want to front on John.  All right.  Okay, good.  Yo, she got a good body, this white chick, man.  That's racist, man.  What's that mean?  Oh, it's a turtle.  It's a turtle.  It's a turtle.  Slow and steady wins the race, right, baby? 
[02:04:30]  Hi.  Pan, pan.  What's up?  Can we see the top of her pubes, John?  Sure.  Oh, sure.  Let's see the wood floor.  Yeah.  Just take it down as far as you can go.  No, that's hot, too, because you get a little friction.  Let's take it down.  Oh, she's wearing little striped panties.  Oh, God.  And it looks very well-groomed.  You know what?  You know what I feel good about right now?  Is the laying that John's going to...  He's going to kill you later with his unit. 
[02:05:00]  John's going to put on a Jay Moore wig later.  He's going to put on the Jackson Terry Balls.  There you go.  That was awesome.  You've got to pursue this career because you're a natural at it.  And you're beautiful.  And those breasts are other-level.  Yeah, yeah.  They say in the fight world, the boxing world, you have other-level breasts.  You should make sure the balloon knot's okay.  Definitely.  It'll be good observation.  Hey, man.  Some of them can be a little messy.  Come on, baby.  You got McDonald's wrappers on it and cigarette butts? 
[02:05:30]  Sure, right?  You can check it.  Lord, wow.  Take a screw magazine and some NyQuil with your hair.  It's a fixed chloroceptic.  Very nice.  Whatever that is.  I mean, you got a nice butt through your knees.  I'm pretty sure Jay Moore would appreciate it.  All right.  I can handle myself.  I'm just saying, Jay.  Go for your own.  I'm just saying, Jay.  I know.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  This is all for me.  All in front of her boyfriend.  I know.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  So you go for your own.  I'm not.  I'm not saying. 
[02:06:00]  Good looking.  Would you like to see that?  You know, I'm not going to bring anything up.  I think we've seen plenty.  We've seen enough.  I don't want to, you know, the first day I have a girl like freaking out and have everybody  going home like, what the hell is that?  I'm not freaking out.  All right.  Well, let's not have sex.  Kelly, you want a hug, Jay?  You know, a little hug?  Sure.  Yeah.  What about a bear chest, a bear chest hug?  Yeah.  Why don't you do that?  I have a furry chest.  All right.  All right.  I can't do that, but I'll hug you.  I just wanted to say.  I'm mean.  I'm mean?  Now you're mean.  Oh.  Come all the way here. 
[02:06:30]  Jay, just think chocolate.  What?  What?  I don't even know what that means.  Velvet.  You don't get that.  All right.  I'll take a hug.  Chocolate was her friend.  I was thinking about velvet.  There's this porn girl that was in here that wanted.  And her friend was chocolate, though.  There was velvet and chocolate.  Was there velvet and chocolate?  And chocolate left.  Chocolate left.  And then velvet was in the other room trying to get me to have sex with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard chocolate.  And velvet.  I heard all about that shit.  That lady.  Are you kidding me?  She said I heard all about you.  That lady could gargle peanut butter. 
[02:07:00]  I wasn't going there.  I'm going to hug you.  All right, Kelly.  She could gargle peanut butter.  Kelly, remove your shirt from the log.  There it is.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You're digging it.  There you are.  There you go.  Hey, did you squeeze her ass?  No, I didn't squeeze her ass.  I'm sorry.  I didn't see.  I'm a gentleman.  I didn't make the radio up.  Talk to me.  What?  Talk to me.  What happened?  I'm not doing that. 
[02:07:30]  You ain't involved in this, man.  What's the matter, old Dirty?  Nothing.  Ben, what happened?  She wants to get around.  I'm not bossing around.  No, I'm not.  Yo, Ben, man.  All right, we're going to take a break.  All right, we'll see what's going on in here.  We still got to play those clips.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Wait, let's see the bottom.  Oh.  Oh.  That's nice, son.  That's really nice.  Oh, sizzling and hot garbage.  That's like French's mustard.  Stump on it.  1027.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breath. 
[02:08:00]  Boom.  Wow.  WNEW.  Uh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, first, Lou, real fast.  Lou, go ahead.  Lou, go.  Yeah.  Go.  You're on the radio.  Go.  Oh, hey, guys.  Listen, I want to buy some of these sperm.  Oh, hey, old Dirty.  This guy wants to purchase some of the sperm that you were going to sell.  Yeah, old Dirty's now selling his sperm.  Lou, what do you want with old Dirty seed?  Well, you see, I go out there and I commit rapes every now and then, and I just want to  leave it at some of the crime scenes. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, that's good.  DNA evidence.  Hey, you know what, guys?  What?  Hey, he actually had a good point there.  What happened?  Why that, why didn't that didn't make the air?  What happened?  But I thought we were all having fun.  Hey, we would let it go through.  Stay with your arm.  We don't give a crap.  We're not the cowards.  Anthony, uh, cable vision.

You bring the body, we bring the whipped cream.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest, only from Opie and Anthony.  It's never the weakest link.  1-0-2-7, WNEW.  Yeah, the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest starts next week, ladies.  You just come down any time next week between 3 and 7 and show off what you got. 
[02:10:30]  Does Kelly want to enter the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest?  What you do, you come in, and you take all your clothes off, but you don't have to do that  in front of anybody.  Then you take a whipped cream, and you make a bikini out of nothing but whipped cream and  sprinkles and other little accoutrements of sundae.  I used to work at an ice cream corner.  Oh, really?  And then the best one is going to be judged.  We'll put the pictures up on the web.  That sounds like the beginning of her first porno scene. 
[02:11:00]  You know, I used to work at an ice cream store.  Right.  Before you know it, boom.  Bow, bow, bow, bow.  Blocky road, baby.  Before you know it, cookies and cream.  I got it.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We have a full house today.  Yeah.  Jay Moore in the studio playing Caroline's Roll this weekend.  Ticket's going fast, real fast.  Call Caroline's for ticket info.  And, of course, Jay Moore hosting Regis and Kelly tomorrow. 
[02:11:30]  Tomorrow morning.  We'll all be checking that out.  On ABC.  ABC.  9 o'clock.  Old Dirty's in the studio.  Of course.  After a long hiatus.  Oh, hi, Old Dirty.  Yeah, thanks, Obie.  Whatever.  Whatever, Old Dirty.  Trying to sell his seed.  All right, we've got to play these tapes finally, Ed.  Yeah.  Come on.  Want to set this up?  Well, there's a lot of controversy on this show.  So who is the biggest scumbag?  Me or Opie. 
[02:12:00]  And, yeah, we played the Bill call a couple of times.  Where a woman calls up and asks for her friend Bill.  And Opie informs her Bill's dad.  And she's horrified.  And this just makes you come off looking really bad.  Right.  And then you say that, oh, there's a tape of Anthony.  Doing something to a funeral parlor.  Right.  And you finally found it.  I finally found it, yes.  So now we will pit the two against each other.  Right.  In a competition.  Who is the biggest scumbag?  Right.  I still think you win. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, all right, what I did was a little distasteful.  A little morbid.  And after they hear the tape, I'll have a lot to say.  Okay.  I'll be able to defend myself.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  So here's me.  This poor lady was calling the radio station up in Boston.  Yeah.  Looking for her friend Bill.  Didn't know she got two a-holes instead.  Bill.  Instead.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat. 
[02:13:00]  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Your kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who is this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God.  Love him.  Yeah.  Big, big, big pile up.  Oh, be sure and give the kids my condolences. 
[02:14:00]  What are you here?  Okay.  Give the kids my condolences.  Oh.  You're awful.  See, that is really bad.  That's good, right?  It's good stuff.  It's horrible.  All right.  So that was you, Ope.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  You know, the funniest part about it, I thought, was the fact that you were trying not to laugh  made it to me that you were crying.  It did.  John.  God love him. 
[02:14:30]  The history of that call, though, our friend, another Jay, was in the studio, and I was just  doing it to crack my friend up.  To make him cringe.  Our friend up.  And they were like, man, this is so sick.  We've got to put it on the radio.  All right, so.  I was just talking to him.  How did it happen?  Where did it happen?  Wait.  I'm not.  Wait.  That's so good.  I know they dumped out that.  Why?  Why was they not bad at that?  Well.  Well, like the thought of him was in time of her. 
[02:15:00]  He just left some oysters on my ass.  Oh, that stays in.  See, it's clever, because it's not descriptive.  It doesn't mean anything.  What are oysters?  You just can't say he was.  His pearl jam tasted like buttermilk and Clorox. 
[02:15:30]  How the hell would you know?  Bill, you just painted a map of Hawaii on my back.  What happened?  I'm still laying in my own makes.  It sounded like Buddy Act did there.  Well, it's not my fault that he died, but I was a holler, so he said he was a fireman.  Remember when we were playing, what's in your pants? 
[02:16:00]  And Buddy goes, I think it's all natural, like a Q-Rack, and I think the knob is polished like a fireman.  She goes, could you date a fireman?  She goes, how'd you know my boyfriend's a fireman?  That's right.  Someone is saying that that lady sounds just like your mother-in-law.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was up in Boston.  I want to go home.  And then we made a little remix to that phone call, Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, no, this is not the same thing.  That was the Precious song.  Yeah, that's something different.  All right, that's okay.  All right, so, uh...  All right.  That's pretty bad.  That proves Opie.  I know it's like ass in here, and I know it's not me, and I know it's not her.  Ain't me.  Ain't mine.  Well, that's four.  It's mine, probably.  Oh.  And if someone smells...  If you, way over there, someone smells like ass, I think there's an ass radius, right? 
[02:17:00]  There's a blast radius.  Oh, look at Dr. Laura in Screw Magazine.  No thanks.  Uh, Adam.  Hey.  Hey.  Laura, what's going on?  What's going on, Adam?  Hey, I...  You know, I used to think that Anthony was the biggest scumbag.  Yeah.  But after hearing that little old lady say, oh, give my condolences to your kids.  I know.  Imagine that was your mother, man.  Give the kids.  It doesn't get worse, man.  It's your mother.  Opie, you're a goddamn crumpet muncher. 
[02:17:30]  Uh...  I think that's a compliment.  Thank you.  All right.  Ken, what's going on?  Thank you, sir.  Hey, what's up?  Opie, biggest scumbag, hands down.  No comparison.  All right.  Bye.  Uh...  Highway.  All right, well, it's...  Gary, Bill's dead, sir.  Bill's dead, man, but we saved his...  Big pile up, ma'am.  Big pile up.  There was a milk truck, and he got splattered on his face like Vanessa Del Rio.  He died.  He got in the coffin. 
[02:18:00]  Got in the coffin.  That's a great reference, man.  In the coffin.  He died.  He got in the coffin.  All right.  So...  Black faggot.  So that's pretty bad.  Yeah.  Obviously.  But I found a prank called that Anthony made.  All right.  Anthony used to play this little game where he would call funeral homes.  Well, you got to...  You look through the obituary, and you find out the name of the guy that died and where  he's going to be laid out.  What funeral home.  Then when the time comes, because it usually goes between two and four or whatever, so during 
[02:18:30]  that time, you call the funeral home.  You ask if so-and-so is there.  The funeral director says, yeah, because he's laid out there.  But then you ask if he can...  If you can put him on the phone.  Right.  Listen for the very uncomfortable silence.  Yes.  There it is.  Anthony being a D.  Hello.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Is John A. there?  John A. there?  Yes.  Who's calling?  Family.  Yeah.  What's your name, sir?  I'm from Florida.  I was wondering if you have a John A. there? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, we do.  And he's there?  Yes.  Okay.  Could I speak to him, please?  You want to speak to him?  Yeah.  Could you put him on the phone, please?  John A. there?  Yes.  He's the deceased.  So he can't come to the phone?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  Christ.  Could you just put him on the phone?  Hello?  This is Ed.  No.  Hang up.  Hang up.  That guy did not seem happy, bro.  Who was that? 
[02:19:30]  He's a member of the family.  Look it up in the obituary.  See who Ed...  Oh, my God.  It's his brother.  Are you serious?  Oh, Jesus.  You're such an idiot.  I didn't know he was going to put him on the phone.  Oh, my God.  They were just standing there talking about, like, how do you want the body laid out?  Right.  Is he there?  With his finger in his nose.  Is he there?  Put him on the phone.  Get him on the coffin.  Put the phone on the coffin.  Put him on the phone.  Put him on the pole lock.  It died.  Get me the dead whore.  He ate a bag of sand.  He's got Terry got in the coffin. 
[02:20:00]  That's pretty twisted, though.  All right.  I hope he's yours is worse.  Yeah.  Yours is worse.  No, why?  Because the guy didn't really die?  Yeah, but that's a prank call where they go, can you believe that jackass?  Man, that makes me mad.  Yours is like, that lady probably like...  Aunt was...  Crashed her book.  Aunt was asking to talk to a dead guy and then got his brother on the phone.  Yeah, well...  You made a woman think like one of her best friends and family members died or something.  Look at this.  Dave, not even close.  Aunt wins.  Dave.  Not even close.  Why? 
[02:20:30]  What are you kidding me?  One sounds like a joke.  The other is just nasty.  Right.  It's nasty.  The guy is really dead and his family's there.  That poor woman.  Ah, see?  He's got it all confused.  He's saying Opie is the worst.  Crack the window when you clean the oven, man.  What happened?  I thought someone was on my side for me.  Brendan.  Yo, Opie, man.  That is the best thing I've ever heard.  Making funny old is funny on so many levels.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:21:00]  I swear to Christ.  Yo, Anthony.  Telling people that they're dead, that's good, too.  But, yo, confusing the old, you're on many levels.  It's fun because they can't fight back.  See, my guy, the guy I was trying to get on the phone was already dead.  Nothing you could do about it.  Yeah, you know what?  I've got to say, for technical difficulty, if I'm a judge in the Olympics, I've got to lean Ant's way because he's dealing with a dead body.  That's what I'm saying.  You're not going to get a lot of spring back off of a dead body.  Opie created dead body.  No, see, eventually the lady's going to find out that Bill's not dead. 
[02:21:30]  She'll be okay.  Yeah, but she's old, and she's going to be even more confused when they drop that pearl of knowledge on her.  But someone's friend told me he was getting a pirate covered in bird jam.  Hi, it's Bill.  This can't be Bill.  Bill's dead.  No, hi, it's Bill.  I blew him down the freaking stand.  I'm dying getting a coffee.  Tara, what's going on?  Hey, I think Anthony's actually the worst for both calls because Anthony not only made fun of the old lady, but then he calls up and makes fun of a dead guy's family. 
[02:22:00]  Well, I think you got it on both ends.  What do you mean he made fun of an old lady?  Oh, Anthony.  He's making fun of the old lady when you're replaying the tape.  Yeah, she doesn't hear me doing that.  No, but we hear you making fun of old people.  Yeah, see, people should realize after I did the Bill's dead thing, Anthony ended up using that voice and all the terminology for the next, like, three years on the radio. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  He loved it.  Well, you know, but it's bad.  You can't make...  It's one thing when you're in the action, you're doing it, and you're rolling with it.  It's another thing afterwards to make fun of people.  You want to play What's in My Pants?  Oh, she hung up.  I'm sorry about that.  Yeah, I wonder where she hung up.  A lot of people say an answer is definitely worse.  I don't think so.  They're not going to talk to the dead guy.  Don't even think so.  The uncomfortable silence, though?  Come on.  Well, yeah, no one says that.  He's deceased.  He's deceased.  He's deceased.  He's deceased.  You're kidding me. 
[02:23:00]  Wait, I just got to...  What the hell kind of way is that to talk about a dead person?  I got the big casino.  Yeah, it's a big casino.  Hey, that's good.  Michael.  Don't touch it!  Michael.  That one fits my pants.  Michael.  Yeah.  Hey.  I think Anthony's got sick of mine because he went out of his way to look up at his funeral  home and to call.  Oh, very good.  Where Opie just fell into it.  Yeah, I fell into it.  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Oh, that lady just called you out of the blue.  You didn't know.  That's what makes it good.  Mine was premeditated.  Opie's just half.  You misdialed.  So I got to give...  Now I swing the technical difficulty points back to Opie because he didn't have preparation  time like he did.  Okay.  Opie was out on a wing of the prayer, you know?  No, I don't want to win this contest.  Mine was a premeditated.  I call it like I said.  I love the two of you and that's just the way it goes down.  Mmm.  I just got to hear this again.  Oh, that the phone call could have killed her is what I'm saying.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, no. 
[02:24:00]  You're kidding.  I have cancer and I've been fighting it, but now why?  Bill was getting me through the chemo.  I'm not going to take my AZT anymore for my full-blown AIDS.  My old lady AIDS.  Yeah, something tells me she's not in a high-risk group there, Jay.  I got the AIDS at Studio 54.  I was having sex and doing cocaine.  With John. 
[02:24:30]  With Bill.  He just dropped me off.  Did he roll his Camaro?  All right, listen.  I want to hear this again.  Oh, no.  It calls the funeral parlor.  Andy Warhol gave a man.  Bill's dead.  Where am I going to get my cocaine?  It's over, Johnny.  Get in the car.  All right, once again, to the point where the guy says he's the deceased. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Anthony asking to talk to a dead guy at the funeral hall.  Hello, man.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  Is John A.M. there?  John A.M. there?  Yes.  Who's calling?  Family.  Yeah, what's your name, sir?  Neat.  I'm from Florida.  I was wondering if you have a John A.M. home.  Yes, we do.  And he's there?  Yes.  Okay.  Could I speak to him, please?  You want to speak to him?  Yeah, could you put him on the phone, please?  John A.M. there?  Yes.  He's the deceased. 
[02:25:30]  So he can't come to the phone?  Yes.  You're fine.  That's not bad.  The awkward pause is the best.  You want to speak to him?  Yeah, put him on the phone, sir.  Put him on the phone.  Put the phone in the coffin, sir.  And you get him, too.  That stiff-haired pineapple-yton-seasucker.  He owes me money.  That's you, Dano.  You book him.  Now, let me hear yours again, Dano.  I don't even know where it is. 
[02:26:00]  Because you don't want to win the contest.  You don't want everybody to see how horrible you mistreated her elderly.  I think Anthony's is...  That lady probably had a...  That guy fought in the World War for crying out loud, probably.  And you're telling her he's dead.  He's probably a patriot.  In a crash.  She probably choked on her rosary beads after that phone call.  What's wrong?  Dick, I love them.  All right, we'll play one more time.  My condolences to his crippled children.  The humanity.  Oh, the humanity. 
[02:26:30]  I'm going to commit harikari.  I'm going out of the front log to self-emulate.  God said you'd light yourself on fire.  Oh, hey.  All right, here it is again.  ESPN.  Here it is.  Here it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is among Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news. 
[02:27:00]  What?  Bill died today.  Your kid...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  I don't believe it. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I can't believe it.  I know.  Where did this happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love them.  Not really.  Big...  Big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Oh, my God.  Give the kids of children my condolences. 
[02:28:00]  I'd like my mom.  She'd have a hard time.  Yeah, let's call your mom.  This is my pal.  She didn't even talk.  Because I love them.  She's still loaded.  They're the coffin.  She was still loaded from Atlantic City in Studio 54.  I'm a cocoon.  I have the oldest brothel license in New York State. 
[02:28:30]  He was getting me customers for the broth.  Now I'm going broke.  Free parking.  Free parking inside of me.  I'm old.  Oh.  It's like a storage bin.  He was the only one I trusted with sex without a condom.  Where am I going to get my anal?  You know, you should have said, oh, but she said, like, who's, how?  And you go, car accident. 
[02:29:00]  At one point, she was almost aggravated.  Like, but how?  You should have went, hey, don't get pushed.  I'm trying to help you out here.  I'm sorry.  I'm bad enough.  I'm going to clean all the blood, teeth, and brains off the walls in this place.  I thought you said car accident.  Yeah.  Where do you think he landed?  Okanala, you dumb whore.  You think I'm crazy about him dying?  Can you get past yourself for a second?  I'm sorry, Jack. 
[02:29:30]  He was my father.  I don't know who you are.  God loves him.  He was my father.  I love my gay, sad, funny father.  Bill is gay.  What are you doing tonight?  Probably sending roses.  Oh, it hurts.  I can't laugh that hard.  Bill looks like he's combed his hair with a car. 
[02:30:00]  Let's take a break.  Yes, sir.  Jay Moore in the studio, playing Caroline's this weekend.  Get your tickets, they go fast.  I'm telling you now.  All right, that's the last plug.  Whatever.  I'll do the plugs for you.  I don't want any more plugs.  No?  That means it's sold out.  No, I have no idea.  But I don't want you guys to think I'd come in for that.  You're like a rock star now.  That's why my brother comes in.  Where's your brother playing tonight?  Bar 9.  Where's Bar 9?  It's on 9th Avenue and 53rd.  Bar 9.

I remember getting a massage from Bill.  And then he slipped me the high...  He used to rest his potatoes on my nose.  They were dirty. 
[02:31:00]  Like potatoes.  Do you know who he sounds like?  He smelled like mulch.  From...  You sound like the guy from the Touchstone Terrace.  The old guy that couldn't find his way home.  I walked too far.  I walked too far.  I walked too far.  I can't find my way home.  How's your guy, the telemarketer guy, doing?  That guy's great.  Tom Mabe.  Oh, he's very cool.  Yeah, I was just wondering who was behind you.  Okay.  The set of a porno just walked in.  What the hell was that? 
[02:31:30]  I don't know what that was.  A bunch of guys are...  All right, we've got to take a break, bud.  We're all going to bar...  Oh, yeah, Micah.  Bar what?  Bar nine.  Bar nine.  I just put a fire log inside of me.  Nice avenue and 53rd.  Right after the show today.  We'll be back.  Get ready, please.  We'll see.  And go with the mouth of Wednesday.  With O.E. and Anthony.  N.E.W. 
[02:32:00]  Boobs.  The world's universal language.  O.E. and Anthony, your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  N.E.W.  That's great.  Hey, welcome.  O.E. and Anthony's show.  The 1027 W at A.W.  O.E., um... 
[02:32:30]  Done shoeing?  Yeah.  Where are you eating?  Uh...  A piece of fruit.  How's that?  Ah.  Oh, ah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Anthony?  Yeah.  The whipped cream bikini contest starts Monday.  I can't wait.  And we've got an incentive for the ladies.  An incentive?  Yeah, management is finally waking up and sales is waking up.  They're coming up with some really good prizes for these contests.  Starting next week, ladies, we want you to come down with your hot bodies.  And we're going to put whipped cream bikinis on you. 
[02:33:00]  You know, we've got sprinkles and all sorts of stuff to jazz it up a bit.  Yeah, you make the bikini you want out of whipped cream and various sprinkles and stuff.  And everybody?  Can everybody be in on this conversation?  We were just talking about this.  Everybody?  Everybody?  I was asking your brother about his gig tonight.  Well, we're in the middle of talking about the whipped cream bikini contest.  I get in trouble.  You know what?  I apologize because the last thing I want to do is hamper the expeditiousness of this program.  Get in a coffin. 
[02:33:30]  Die, you little cat faggot.  Lick my staff in.  We are all mortal.  All right.  So, ladies, next week, all you have to do, like the other countertests we did, just show up.  That's it.  Any day next week, between 3 and 7.  So we just buttoned it with whipped cream all over.  Yeah, we'll have the whipped cream here.  Don't come with whipped cream on.  No.  The can rival.  You come down with whipped cream and we'll do the whippets.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what we're worried about.  Thank God Psycho Marks on vacation.  Give me some of those cans.  Gah, gah, gah. 
[02:34:00]  You know, it's a great idea, you guys, and you guys are always pushing the envelope.  Yes, thank you.  Well, because someone has to make the G-string go up the crack, and you can't half-ass it.  That's right.  You've got to spread it and apply it.  And I, for one, volunteer.  Will you be around this week?  Yeah.  There you go.  It's going to be a wild week.  I'll shoot baby batter into your anthill.  Put the cherry on the starfish.  Put the cherry on the starfish.  Let me lick it.  I'll eat it.  And you never know when a chunkier skull will sail out of a limo and dial his taxes. 
[02:34:30]  Ain't that cherry you are.  So, ladies are calling up saying, you know, what do I do for this contest?  It's very easy.  We make it easy for you.  Just come down.  Any day next week between 3 and 7, we'll take the pictures, and then we'll put you on the  website, just like the other contest.  That's all you've got to do.  And we'll do the rest.  Easy.  What can you do for this?  8887th Avenue.  But here's the cool thing.  The contest, first of all, is brought to you by whippedcreambikini.com.  Trip is courtesy of Contiki Tours and Victory Limousine. 
[02:35:00]  You want to know what the grand prize is for this contest?  Let's see.  A Hummer.  A Hummer, yeah.  A trip.  Anal.  Anal.  A trip.  Where?  To.  Where?  Newark.  Oh, you beat me.  I was going to say Hershey, Pennsylvania.  Very good.  To Hawaii.  Hawaii?  Map of Hawaii in Hawaii.  I visited the king of Hawaii, and I gave him a map of Hawaii on his rectum.  How did we swing that? 
[02:35:30]  I don't know.  So, once again, the winner of the win.  People, I asked him, and drived him with alcohol.  He's hopping in.  He was drunk and slept on his stomach.  Hey, great trip.  They're going to drop you from a Jap Mitsubishi Zero.  Right on top of the Arizona.  Die, die, die.  We don't even need Otto and Georgian here anymore.  Sucks to be Otto.  Will you suck the mule?  There may be a 50 take behind the home. 
[02:36:00]  Probably didn't make it.  What's the big deal?  Die, get in the coffin.  A trip to Hawaii.  That rocks.  And all they have to do is show up and put whipped cream in the shape of a bikini on their body.  Yeah, starting next week.  So, yeah, a trip to Hawaii.  Okay, so this is very cool, right?  Nice.  Yeah, and how did the whipped cream get removed?  And that's how you're going to really determine the winner.  The filthy animal is going to let us all lick our body off of the whipped cream.  Two contests in one.  Right. 
[02:36:30]  Bonus prize on the other.  And if you want to win the contest, I mean, this is a trip to Hawaii.  This is no, like, you know, stupid Talbot's gift certificate.  You know what I mean?  And we also have Talbot's gift certificates, Steve, which, Jay, of course we don't.  But I'm saying, like, if you give the hosts a Hummer, you'll probably win.  So, come on down, ladies.  Make sure I win, Opie.  I want to answer the contest.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  I'll bring some whipped cream and they'll put it on. 
[02:37:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  Otto George in the studio as well.  Wink, wink.  Sharon?  Yes.  Who do you want to talk to today?  Well, I wanted to just tell Otto that I enjoyed him Saturday night at Poughkeepsie, New York.  You had a filthy whore in the fifth row.  Yes, and he owes me a pair of underwear because I peed them.  You peed your drawers, you filthy effing whore.  Yeah, that's me.  That's me.  That's what I like to do. 
[02:37:30]  You like Otto and George?  Yes, very much.  My husband also foiled his drawers.  That's because he's gay.  He better not be.  I can't even say what I want to say.  No, you said it all Saturday night.  Your husband has Hershey's Kisses on his private parts.  And I'm very happy for it.  Were you the big fat chick?  Yes, that was me.  Yeah, you're a filthy slob.  Thank you. 
[02:38:00]  Disgusting.  There's got to be more of us in the world because then there would be no skinny.  Spread your legs and bake a pie.  Thank you.  Throw your hands in flour.  Look for the wet spotting and fill it with spackle.  You want a bite of my big floppy pie there, Otto?  I'd rather eat pig, Mommy.  You're so sensitive.  I love when you talk to me and say things like, get off your choking me.  Die.  Drag your car into a pole.  Sit up or I'll get Woody after you. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, that's real funny, you filthy whore.  All right, Sharon.  Sit on your feet.  All right, thank you.  So you're Joey, Otto, and George on our show today.  She can't even handle a phone.  She ate it.  Fat bitch.  Who?  She pees on her nuts.  All right.  I don't understand faggots.  We're a group of people that don't reproduce.  Where are they all coming from? 
[02:39:00]  Otto and George is like, in my opinion, absolute comedy.  Why is it?  It's icon at this point.  Why is it Otto calling in?  Otto calling.  Is this draw up on the road because of the show?  It must be.  He's staring at the phone going, phone, crack pipe, phone, crack pipe.  Sweat off the drugs first.  I've been a good boy, Daddy.  I'll line her ass in a mouth.  Put your seat up, sir.  We're crashing.  Sir, fix your tray table. 
[02:39:30]  We're going into cornfield.  All right.  I dug up another piece of tape because I'm losing this battle with you, the biggest scumbie.  Oh, great.  What now?  Oh, we went to the vault, Sarton.  Went to the vault.  Going to the vault.  Oh, you snake.  Well, I got just another example of you being a sick F.  All right.  What did I do this time?  Remember our game, Hi, Mom? 
[02:40:00]  Either Hi, Mom, I'm gay we played.  Hi, Mom, I'm in jail.  Hi, Mom, I'm in co-core.  Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Porno, Hi, Mom, I'm...  I got fired for whacking it at work.  Exactly.  Yeah, the Hi, Mom game, sure.  An ONA original?  I can't really think of anything that was really that bad with them.  Well, this piece of tape, we don't play often.  Usually when we play the Hi, Mom game, it gets a little ugly, but in the end, everyone is kind of chuckling and going, oh, thank God that wasn't real.  Right.  Well, during this phone call, the Hi, Mom game went drastically wrong. 
[02:40:30]  Took a terrible turn.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  This one's called Hi, Mom, I'm in jail.  All right.  It's not the one that's on our Dementor World CD.  This was the one we wanted to put on the Dementor World CD, but Dodda Dave thought it was too cruel.  I think it's too cruel, and I'm an effing S-headed F-D-C.  So, here's Anthony being... 
[02:41:00]  Sometimes you just gotta curse.  Damn it.  Here's Anthony being a little cruel.  Hello, Mark.  Yo.  Are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm in jail?  Sure.  All right, now, what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  You're going to tell her that you were with a couple of prostitutes?  Yeah.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  Yeah, I haven't been to jail in, like, about eight years, so...  So, she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know?  Uh-oh.  Oh, and you're married, and you got called with the prostitutes?  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Maybe you could tell her something like you can't tell your wife, obviously, so you had to call her.  Yeah, I called her a couple of them.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good.  Here we go.  All right.  Should be ringing.  You're going to have to speak up real loud, because the phones really suck.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mom!  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught with a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark!  It's your son Mark! 
[02:42:00]  Where are you?  I'm in jail.  Where?  In Lowe, right here.  Downtown.  Don't, don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, get away, sir.  I don't know.  You can't, don't call, don't call my house.  Oh, this calls me monitor, ma'am.  Okay.  I didn't know if you were joking with me or serious or what.  Mom, serious.  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That will be cash. 
[02:42:30]  $5,000?  Yes.  What did he do?  He was found with a couple of prostitutes in the Lowell area, one of which was a transvestite.  And, uh, it's a serious charge, ma'am.  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma!  He's in Lowell?  Ma!  What?  Can you come?  We gotta clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Yeah, because now the newspapers print all the, uh, Johns that were caught with prostitutes, 
[02:43:00]  so his, his name will be emblazoned, uh, for all to see in the Boston Herald tomorrow.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We, uh, we know also the prostitute has, uh, tested positive for, uh, the AIDS virus,  which is another problem he's gonna have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am?  Yes, I'm here.  Oh.  Where, where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up, uh, to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am!  What?  Ma'am, I, I, I don't know how to tell you how this happened. 
[02:43:30]  Oh.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I picked him up with a couple of them.  Oh.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I don't.  I don't.  Mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah.  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God.  I can't do this anymore.  Ma!  I can't do this.  Ma!  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Happy Mother's Day, ma.  This is a joke.  This was the worst.  It's all a joke.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, man.  Oh, no.  Ma!  She's all, she's all right.  He's fine.  He's, he's not in jail.  It's only...  Why?  You're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head.  Mom, you still there?  Yeah.  Talk to us, ma'am.  Look how upset.  Oh, my God.  I got to make a phone call. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Call's back.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Oh, my God.  Seriously, I can joke with it, you know.  I'm always joking with it.  Oh, no.  Honestly, I'm always joking with it.  Oh, we feel, we feel horrible now.  You've got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Oh, no.  That was unbelievable.  See, you know what it is, though?  I, I push it out.  And I think I'm more of a prick now than I was then.  Because I would have just kept going now.  You're going, I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, she started getting all upset.  And I'm like, oh, okay, it's a joke.  But the line in there that is twisted, telling a mother that the, not only the kid in jail, 
[02:45:00]  for, like, doing prostitutes, that one of the prostitutes, like, tested positive for  the HIV.  Full-blown AIDS, sir.  Oh, everybody's got it now.  It's a big thing.  It's cured, right?  I guess.  Look, James Brown and Mick Jagger don't have it.  You think they're rolling on magnums?  Those guys, it was shoot, shoot, shoot to kill.  And James Brown and some geechy you-know-what, man, they came out of trees to get to him. 
[02:45:30]  Mick Jagger.  Oh, man.  Sorry, darling, let me roll on my condom.  Yeah, you know that wasn't happening.  Snip the cocaine off my unit, and then I'll roll on my condom.  Make it numb with cocaine.  Make it numb with cocaine.  You don't want my trousers to fall down now, do you?  Guys, girls, you didn't care.  No, he didn't care.  And he's fine.  Yeah, look at James Brown.  James Brown doesn't have AIDS.  Ileana Douglas hosted a list on VH1, and he was one of the guests.  And at the end, she stood up to hug all... 
[02:46:00]  I can't say that.  Ileana Douglas...  Hold on, hold on, because they're dumping out.  Cock.  All right.  So, right now, they've got to dump out again, you...  You've got to wait, wait, wait.  All right, start over.  Go ahead.  Everybody watch some!  Oh, there's going to be a bad answer.  So, he got up, and he was...  Ileana Douglas hosted the list on VH1.  James Brown was one of the guests, and at the end, during the silence, you hug everybody  goodbye, and he pressed his...  He was fully excited. 
[02:46:30]  He was excited, you know, James Brown style, and he pushed it up against her, and she told  me this when we were working on action together, so it's true, and he goes, I'd like to make  a 60-year-old man very happy.  All right.  So, she's going to have his baby.  Yeah.  She made him happy.  We're going to take a break, and we're going to wrap up this mess.  I don't think no man very happy.  And then we're all heading to what?  What do you mean, Bill?  Bar 9.  Bar 9, 53rd and 9th Avenue.  53rd.  Opie and Anthony at Bar 9 to support...

[02:51:00]  Oh, man.  Blues Brothers.  That's great.  We're the good old boys.  We're on a mission from God.  We're on a mission from God.  When the good old boys showed up.  That was so funny, man.  We're the good old boys.  And they play, and then the real good old boys show up with the bus.  Who are you?  We're the good old boys.  Remember when they walk in the first time, and he goes, Jesus, this place is a barn.  It's a chicken wire.  See that head come apart, man?

I bet he's crying his little gook hard out for Sal and Manny.  That's how he laughs.  He's laughing at you, Taylor.  Y'all, Hophead, smoke this stuff to escape from reality?  Y'all talk about death? 
[02:52:00]  Y'all experts?  I'd like to hear about it, Potheads.  I don't smoke this stuff because I am reality.  Y'all love bias.  You're the water walker, do-gooder.  But when the machine breaks down, we break down.  Gentlemen, I can't have that.  Louie.  Yeah?  Hey, what up?  Dad had to be the funniest bit, the jail.  People were looking at me.  I was hysterical laughing.  I had to crawl underneath my passenger seat.  I mean, I had to cover my face.  That was so funny. 
[02:52:30]  He was cringing.  Oh, hi, Mom, I'm in jail.  Oh, okay.  I like when the kid kept laughing.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know how it is.

By Major Nelson.  I just saw Jeannie.  Where did he...  But then I...  And then he...  Hey.  I'm dying of eating exhaustion.  I had to pick a leather jacket as my get-up.  Richard Simmons wears shorts and a t-shirt. 
[02:54:00]  You know, don't do this.  I'm dying over here.  I need lotion.  I'm getting ashy.  I had to pick the leather jacket.  Hey, club soda.  It's good I needn't go with the parka.  My whole life is going to be on the Neskimo.  With the wetsuit underneath.  Nice.  Nice.  And the yam bag warmers.  You can't do it out of rain. 
[02:54:30]  Clean them up against the dryer.  Gonzo.  Yo, you guys are killing me.  Hey, Jay's on fire.  Ant's on fire.  I hope he's on fire.  We're all on fire.  Gonzo, what do you got?  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Oh, ho.  All right.  I learned two things.  I learned the new ghetto math that three to the third power equals six.  Yep.  And I learned that when Ant gets really pissed, he starts cursing in acronyms.  You F-N-P-C-Q-Z-F-whatever. 
[02:55:00]  Nice.  Thanks, guys.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  He's syndicated now or something like that.  What an educational program.  Acronism.  What does that mean, sir?  Hey, Bobby's got one of yours.  Bobby, what did you learn?  I learned that Drudge Jr. leaks on his nut.  And 1027 is your new country station.  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  You should have said Drudge Jr. is so small, he pees on his nut.  Well, he's not pees on his nut.  Well, okay.  And then we dance.  And then we dance.  That's just no wonder. 
[02:55:30]  He'll just say stuff.  Yeah, so I'm slamming her, and she's all embarrassed.  I go, so what?  We're at the bank.  And then we dance.  No.  No.  Here's the air conditioner.  You're going to have to move your car.  You're going to have to move your car, sir.  Out in the park, I'll let you hurt.  You left your lights on.  Light and light.  W-T-X-3-0-7.  You left your lights on. 
[02:56:00]  I could have done that for me.  Thanks for the nice, quiet place to rehearse.  Oh, God.  I think Jay is cruel than all of us.  I think you won the contest, Jay.  I'll tell you one thing, man.  Finger bang from home.  What did I learn?  If it weren't for that stupid EOE thing, you'd be able to let Earl quit once and for all.  Ah.  Oh, ah.  What's EOE?  We never met our new intern, did we?  What is EOE?  Where is she?  Is she out there? 
[02:56:30]  Did she go home?  Mystery intern.  Jerry from Edison, New Jersey.  I learned baseball managers should wear Armani suits.  Well, why do baseball managers have to dress up like the players?  They look completely ridiculous.  The fighting coach standing there in his speed up.  Come on, Bobby.  The Zimmer.  The Zimmer fills that uniform out very well.  And his army helmet.  And why is it?  He looks like my grandma's in my house.  Hogan! 
[02:57:00]  He looks like Sprewell.  They should make Jeff Van Gundy dress up like, you know.  Like Sprewell.  The guy looks like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons.  Hey, Tim.  John Starks.  Yes.  Brendan Malone, who is that man?  Patrick Ewing, sir.  He looks like Deion Warwick.  Why does he sweat so much?  He's a go-getter.  Why is he wearing fake reading glasses? 
[02:57:30]  With a briefcase coming out of the players' meeting when you know it's filled with comic books.  Patrick can't read Smithers.  Brendan Malone, sir.  Excellent.  Look at the saddlebags into my eyes.  I bow to that.  Kurt Thomas is killing us.  Yes.  Mitch Monteleone.  Your attention fans now batting Kelly Ripa. 
[02:58:00]  26 months.  Kelly doesn't even know what she's in for tomorrow when Jay hosts.  Host Regis and Kelly tomorrow morning.  Jay Moore.  He's going to destroy my show, Will.  I hope I have a show to come back to, Gellman.  I hope he doesn't wreck my chair.  I know.  I don't want any, what they call, a splooge stay on my chair.  Morning television, you don't fart into a mic.  What is with him out Thursday?  I sure hope he knows how to work the phone so he can take a Rube winner from Kansas and give him some Tupperware, Gellman. 
[02:58:30]  Gellman.  Gellman with the Caesar cut.  I hope Jay Moore's a gentleman.  All my impressions are bleeding together at this point.  It's all right.  I'm so popped up on coffee and screw magazine.  It's all right.  Where's, uh, what, that, uh, Mrs. Monacotti, Norton?  Where the hell is Fabergeant?  Where's Fabergeant? 
[02:59:00]  Well, Regis, I'll tell you right now, I'm going right to the million dollars.  I, you know, why fool around?  Why beat around the bush?  I'm going right for the million dollars.  Board your head right for the million dollars.  Board your head right for the million dollars.  And your wife feels the same way.  Hey, it doesn't matter.  Now you know it, they know it, everybody knows it.  Let's just get going.  All right, we're going to have you, you have to keep the balloon in the air.  Remember the one where he was practicing at home?  And he had to keep the balloon in the air and spin the plates or something? 
[02:59:30]  I got it.  You get the balloon.  Al, let's wear the pots.  I need food.  All right, who wrote Suwannee River?  Suwannee, Suwannee River?  Ed Martin?  I'm sorry, Mr. Cranston, that's incorrect.  I'm sorry, you're the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Wait a minute, I'm confused.  Help me, Gelman.  Gelman, his show looks just like mine.  With the lights and the da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:00:00]  Why does Sally Jesse Raphael have a fake impression?  Sally Jesse, she looks like a severely on the rag.  If Sally Jesse and Judge Judy had, like, some demon seed child from Old Dirty's seed.  Oh, man, the amount of landscapers you're selling is exciting.  Sally Jesse Raphael and the Matrix.  Rick Delgado, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Now that...  Rick, how many hits did you have in the softball game last year?  I had one. 
[03:00:30]  Me, two.  You had a strikeout, though.  I know, but I had as many...  Hey, you know when the game is this year?  Then Rick faked the leg injury.  Rick, remember that?  And Joe Torrey never batted for your team.  Mike Torrey.  Mike Torrey.  Yeah, well, no, Joe was there in spirit.  Rick, first hit he gets, he's running down.  Oh, my arm!  What happened?  I got the hit, Martin.  I'm going to sit down and let everybody enjoy the game.  There's beautiful girls, sunshine, and I don't have a girlfriend breathing up my ass. 
[03:01:00]  She's any other dog out taking pictures of Rick Carone.  Mike Torrey plays second base the entire game for Opie's team and never wants to be back.  So that, my friend, is a forfeit.  You can't prove that.  I'll get the tape.  We're going to announce the day of the next game soon.  Yep.  Oh, I hope another network doesn't spoil it.  I don't have to play a rock block.  Rock block.  Maybe Craig Shoemaker will come in and help us write some gags.  Yeah!  Awesome! 
[03:01:30]  Yeah!  Because he's the love master.  That's right, man.  Yeah!  Yeah, it's extreme, man.  Hey, yeah!  Tune in.  Don't worry.  Someone's getting it out.  A few more minutes.  You tune in.  You hear that.  All right.  And finally, Jerry from Medicine, I learned you can't run for mayor unless you have at least  eight pubes.  That's right.  Get in the coffin.  We got to go.  And a rancid prostate.  You ever see a black vagina?  Don't it look like a wallet?  Don't it.  You dropped your bus pass, ma'am. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, let's hear it for Kelly, who got naked for us today.  Kelly has a great future.  Kelly, what do you want to say to four million people?  Great job.  Why don't you plug your website or something?  www.foundrymusic.com  Nice.  And I will say that Rick did take a photo or two, and it will be on Foundry Music.  All right?  Good.  Everybody go.  Thank you, Kelly.  And we need feedback.  Thank you, Kelly's boyfriend.  Yeah, John, guys, I want to thank you, and I want to say what's up to all the guys at 
[03:02:30]  RBP.  I know they're listening right now.  Say it again, because you're a good sport.  RBP.  You know who you are.  Yeah, your girlfriend got felt up by the talented Jay Moore.  With red fingers, by the way.  She told me outside that she's never going to wash her breasts again.  There you go.  John the Anvil Night Home.  I love that stinky tans.  Look at his chin.  Lace hair.  It looks like spiders having a meeting.  Looks like ants waving.  Oh, Dirty, what do you got?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where you going to be?  Yo, I'm going to be all over the place this weekend. 
[03:03:00]  Rikers?  Big up.  Nah, nah, nah.  Rikers.  Lama.  No, back in Lama Sheen.  Rikers.  Lama Sheen.  Big up to Eli and his wife, Lynette, expecting their first.  Is that your seat or a...  Nah, nah, that's your seat.  That's your seat.  And, Lynette, make sure you get back in shape in a hurry, because I want some more of it.  After you drop the bed.  Oh, God damn.  I mean, I'll do it now.  I'll just tip her on her side like a canoe.  Oh, man.  Bye, get in the coffin. 
[03:03:30]  Caroline's in the party.  Okay, that's it.  We're going to have to fight, too.  Get in the party.  Get in the coffin.  All right, all three.  Thank you.  There's no business like show business, old tongue, my starfish.  I want hummus from every girl in the crowd, except family.  Yeah.  Brother Joe?  Yeah, we're all heading down to Bar 9.  It's on 9th and 53rd.  53rd.  A lot of us are going down to check out Brother Joe.  We're doing some acoustic stuff, right?  Sure.  We're going to have some fun down there.  Why not?  I'm going to lose my eyes. 
[03:04:00]  I don't think so.  Only for a moment did I hit a tree.  And finally, Jay Moore.  Come on.  Give it up for you, Jay.  Jay, on fire.  On fire today.  Bravo.  Playing Caroline's this weekend.  I don't even know if there are tickets available.  You better call Caroline's immediately for that.  Good luck.  And, of course, we'll...  If you suck the owner, you will get in.  The owner's a woman, sir.  We'll be watching Jay on Regis and Kelly tomorrow as he fills in for Regis. 
[03:04:30]  Thought you were the tranny, sir.  9 a.m. tomorrow morning on ABC, right?  Yeah, I'll be on Regis, and I'm going to act like a gentleman.  You guys will be surprised.  All right.  Suit and tie.  That's right.  Don't blow my gig.  That's my moneymaker.  Millionaire's okay, but I need my show.  Housewives of Middle America are going to say,  that is a nice young man.  Oh, yeah?  Now tongue my ass.  Come over here and do my daughter.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  Thank you, Jay. 
[03:05:00]  That was a lot of fun.  And I still say Opie's the sickest with the lady already called.  No doubt.  No, the AIDS call topped it.  Yeah, that's worse.  How did it happen?  You're both filthy.  All right.  And, ladies, thanks for whipping them out today.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Keep whipping them out all night long.  We'll see you guys tomorrow night.  So there's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's ONA.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
