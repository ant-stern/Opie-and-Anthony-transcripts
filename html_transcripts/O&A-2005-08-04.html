<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Jim Norton recounting graphic and explicit details of his experiences with an escort service, detailing numerous negative encounters.  The hosts and callers used vulgar language throughout this segment. The conversation then shifted to a news story about a man murdering his wife after years of nagging, sparking a discussion on marital strife, featuring personal anecdotes from Opie and Anthony and callers. Humorous bits involved sound effects, photoshopped images of Jim Norton, and an obscured audio segment of Tony Danza.  A caller claiming to have murdered his wife called in with graphic details; the hosts expressed skepticism but intended to verify the claim.

Next, a caller, "John the trucker," recounted how his second wife contacted him in prison after seeing his name in *Easy Rider* magazine.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of Tom Brokaw's retirement from NBC Nightly News, with the hosts humorously comparing their own anxieties about retirement to Brokaw's emotional send-off.  They digressed into a discussion of *About Schmidt*.  A significant portion focused on "Psycho Mark," a former employee who gave an interview to Fox News about the hosts' firing.  The hosts played clips, mocking Psycho Mark and contrasting his account with their own.  The segment included jokes about Psycho Mark's past behavior.  Finally, they discussed outrage over provocative baby t-shirts, with examples like "Bitch, better have my bottle" and "My mom puts out," and shirts with offensive slogans referencing Hitler and the Holocaust.

The show continued with further discussion of offensive t-shirts, including "Daddy Drinks Because I Cry," "Playground Pimp," and "Arrest Black Babies Before They Become Criminals."  The focus shifted to Reverend Al Sharpton's impending divorce, with the hosts and a studio guest, Earl, commenting on the androgynous appearance of Sharpton's wife, Kathy.  A side conversation ensued about Earl's restaurant bill avoidance habits.  Steve-O joined the broadcast, his arrival delayed by a nap near the elevators.  He discussed his stunts, tattoos (including ones saying "shit" and "fuck"), his relationship with Mae Anderson, swallowing a condom filled with drugs, stapling his scrotum to his thigh, and related legal consequences.  Anthony played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas throughout this segment.

Steve-O's in-studio interview continued, detailing his arrest in Louisiana for stapling his testicles to his leg, his $1.12 million bail, and the court's characterization of the act as "an act of art." He discussed his new DVD and experiences with satellite radio. The hosts discussed Steve-O's partner's arrest in Miami.  Various Jackass stunts were discussed, followed by a contentious exchange between Opie and Anthony over a "Mini-Me" soundbite.  The segment concluded with the arrival of Tippi Tom, a seemingly intoxicated individual who engaged in rambling conversations, attempted to sing, and created a chaotic atmosphere. Tippi Tom appeared to pass out, eventually waking up and continuing his disruptive behavior.  Other guests present during this segment included Sabrina Sikora, Chris Rush, and Zach Wylde.

The show continued with more of Tippi Tom's antics, including his repeated falling asleep (estimated at two hours).  He reluctantly recounted receiving oral sex from a drag queen for a dollar fifty near a dumpster.  Tippi Tom's interrupted musical performances (including "I Left My Heart in San Francisco") were featured. The segment culminated in Tippi Tom falling asleep on the toilet while defecating, prompting discussion and the showing of video footage, including a close-up of his soiled underwear.  Offers to wear the soiled underwear were made and rejected.  Additional guests were expected but delayed due to traffic. The hosts frequently used vulgar and sexually explicit language throughout.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  It really was funny.  Spring is sprung.  Spring is sprung.  Look where I'm putting my tongue.  In your bum.  And he doesn't care.  And he doesn't care.  And he doesn't care.  And he doesn't care.  Sniffing.  Did you?  Of course I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big sniff.  Yeah.  Right in there.  With my meat.  I want to go and bounce the moon.  Just like a couple of tits.  Just like the toy balloon on his schlong. 
[00:05:00]  You and I are just like a couple of tits.  Couple of tits.  running across the moon.  Running across the moon.  Running across the moon.  Drink my jizz.  We were like a couple of tits.  We were like a couple of tits.  The type that are featured on Gary Glitter's computer.  We were like a couple of tits.  If you go to the website, Natalia is the one, by the way. 
[00:05:30]  She's beautiful.  Jason from Boston.  It's called shampooing when you rub the girl's head while she's blowing you.  Oh, shampooing.  I've never heard that one before.  And then she gets a mouth full of cream rinse.  Yeah.  Feel so young.  This is sent in by Natalie.  Natalie wants to talk about Jim Norton's conscience.  Seriously, Jim, none of that treatment had anything to do with the fact that you were going to talk about this on satellite radio,  which is broadcasted all over the country. 
[00:06:00]  Well, you could look at it like that if you were Jim Norton on the Rusty Trombone, everyone.  Jim Norton.  Henchman from Brooklyn.  They know Jimmy's addiction, and they want to be his main pusher.  Yeah, they gave you the first one for free, man.  It's over, Johnny.  Because I was talking to Jim.  I'm like, this is way too dangerous, because he already spends a lot of money on this service.  Yes.  You're not even going to go back to the old way.  You're going to be calling these people like crazy.  Dope, man.  Dope, man.  And I know they're going to be giving, you know, they're going to help you out, but after a while, though, man, 
[00:06:30]  you're going to be spending some serious cash.  You get addicted on the treatment.  You really do.  Oh, man.  On the whole nice hand-holding thing.  You seem to be into that whole thing of the kissing and hugging.  At times, yes.  So I don't understand why you don't get a girlfriend.  Because, first of all, girlfriends don't do things as well as this girl did.  I mean, at least none I've ever had.  I mean, they're nice, but...  Right. 
[00:07:00]  And you're also paying for the instantaneous stuff you're getting.  Like, the hand-holding...  Like, that's the type of girl you'd see.  You'd see her out, and you'd want to touch her or whatever, but you can't.  You understand what I mean?  That's, to me, what...  It's not just sex.  It's the whole thing of the kissing and the whole touching...  You know, the way you just...  Someone I shouldn't be able to kiss and touch.  The way you describe it sounds just like a serial killer talking about murder.  Like, they talk about it the same way.  It's very rational in their head.  No, no.  You know, see, when I strangle someone, and then I disembowel them, it's because I look 
[00:07:30]  at them and want to do it, and you're like a crazy person.  But, yeah, I mean, I'm addicted.  I'm definitely addicted, but...  Yeah, you are.  I've...  Believe me, there's...  80% or 70% of my experiences are horrendous that I've had.  Awful.  Really?  Awful.  You feel like you didn't get your money's worth?  Ugh.  You know, one did just terrible.  Could have just jacked it at home, and...  I told you that...  Oh, yeah, I already told that story, but the two girls in L.A.  I just had so many bad ones, ones that smell, stretch marks, fats. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Just awful.  I told you, one time in New Brunswick, in Jersey, I had a pregnant one in my parents' basement  in the room my grandmother had lived in before a fatal heart attack.  Oh, great.  That's what you want.  And this pregnant chick sparks up a crack pipe.  I swear to God, seven and a half months pregnant, she sparks up a crack pipe in my grandmother's  old living room.  You've come a long way.  Yeah.  That's a true story.  A pregnant crack whore.  You don't understand the disasters I've hooked up with.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Or the awful ones I've had.  All right.  Well, that's great. 
[00:08:30]  Nice.  There's the review right there.  Very good review.  Yeah, my confidential dot com.  And I wish I could...  For your girlfriend experiences.  I wish I could goof on it, but God damn it, I couldn't.  No.  Very happy for you, Jimmy.  Honestly, this is better than goofing on it.  This is pretty interesting.  Yeah.  I'm not giving away my free hour anymore.  And I'm normally for white girls.  Not that I'm a racist, but I normally go for white girls.  Yeah.  It's just what I like, you know, because of the whole superiority thing and the fact that  we're God's people.  No, it was...  But he showed me this black girl that the ass was so... 
[00:09:00]  It was almost like a painting of an ass.  It was so smooth and pretty.  You ever see an ass so nice, it gets you angry?  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry, I was...  Could you get me the bell and the wacky horn?  Yeah, we need our props.  For what?  Nice picking up on those hand signals, Kev.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Well, Jimmy, you ruined it for all of us.  Why?  Definitely not going for Natalia now.  Ah, that's right. 
[00:09:30]  You just took her out of the equation.  Oh.  Because, I mean, you're making it all nice and stuff, but you've told way too many stories  on the show, so she's now out of the equation.  Well, I'm not clean, though.  I'm very clean.  I just got tested about three months ago.  Yeah, in three months.  Norton will call all his friends every three months and tell everybody that, you know,  he passed his test.  He gets very excited.  He passed his AIDS test.  Well, I don't think I have AIDS.  I'm not into taking AIDS in the rump.  How many times have you called your friends to say, you know, you pass?  You get very excited on that day.  You have to.  Yeah, you always get nervous. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, Ben?  He did.  He came up to me in Boston.  He goes, dude, I just tested negative.  It was a great day.  You know, you were all excited.  Dude, I had a red ring on my chest.  Ready to go out for another three months and try again?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm failing.  Hey, maybe I'll get it next time.  I had a red ring on my chest, and I thought I had one escort, actually a dominatrix who  was going to use me as a toilet, tell me she thought it was ringworm.  So I was like, well, panicking.  I'm like, you know, I'm a 36-year-old white guy.  I have African child disease.  Yeah, ringworm.  But I didn't.  It turned out to be an allergic reaction to laundry detergent. 
[00:10:30]  But I thought it might be AIDS.  I was panicked.  Panicked, dude.  So I went to the doctor, and he tested me.  He's like, you don't have AIDS.  I'm like, just test me.  Hep, AIDS, everything I tested for.  Totally clear.  You didn't get to play Monster Rain yesterday, huh?  No, we didn't play Monster Rain.  They don't have the Monster Rain service?  No.  NY Confidential.com?  I think they did.  Sounds like they did everything that you would do while playing Monster Rain.  Well, no, I think Monster Rain is with another guy, though.  All the sig pics are flying up.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Yeah, there's, what's his name again?  Cage from whackbag.com.  You go to opiananthony.com. 
[00:11:00]  This guy's photoshopping as we go.  Yeah.  We do a subject on the show, and he's photoshopping stuff and making it very, very funny.  They got you as Prince in Purple Rain and says Monster Rain.  Very funny.  I didn't see opiananthony.com to check that stuff out.  Yes, Anthony.  Instant feedback.  Norton, of course, she got wet.  Stick $1,200 under any chick's nose and tell her that an hour and many tears later, it's all hers,  and see if she gets wet an hour and many tears later.  I really want to, I hope she's honest with us. 
[00:11:30]  I hope she's honest with us.  I think she will be.  I think she's going to give us the company line.  I really want to.  I think she'll be all nice and say, yeah, Jimmy was great.  But maybe, Jimmy, I tell you, I was packing 14 yesterday.  My rod was very lovely.  Really?  Very impressive.  Yeah.  We'll get some stuff out of her, but I think in general.  Yeah, we'll get some stuff out of her, all right?  Everything Jimmy put in her.  It's still coming out of her.  Squeeze her like a toothpaste tube.  I should come out.  Hey, Anthony, what's up? 
[00:12:00]  Not too much.  That old gag.  What's going on, bud?  Anthony from Long Island, go.  I'm here.  I'm here.  Listen, Jimmy is going to be like Robert Downey Jr. in Less Than Zero with this.  They're going to turn him into a male prostitute.  Are you saying that Jimmy gives good head and is dead?  What's that, Jim?  No, it's just a sign from Less Than Zero.  Go ahead.  It all starts off.  Yeah, they're definitely turning him into a male prostitute, like six months from now.  Yeah, it's definitely going to be like on another website for them. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  It starts off nice.  It all starts off fine and dandy.  You think you're in control.  But eventually we're going to open up one of those doors and you're going to be on your  knees as Joseph for a day.  Come on.  Look, let me just put my tongue in the ass.  I don't care if she's showered.  Just a second.  No, no, you owe us.  That was one of the sickest scenes in Less Than Zero.  Robert Downey Jr. is on his knees.  I saw it recently, but it was on TV and they cut that part.  He became such a drug addict that he was blowing that guy to get some... 
[00:13:00]  So that's what happens.  Some crack.  Whatever you got to do.  You got a little crack.  That's going to be like you, though.  Everything was nice, but now you're going to be banging on the door every day.  Come on, man.  I need it.  I need it, man.  Come on.  Help me out.  Could you imagine being somebody that has your addiction and doesn't have an income?  What the hell would you do if you didn't have the money to spend?  You'd be wrapping old ladies over the head with bricks.  No, you just go online and whack your back.  No, that's what Newark is for.  Five bucks? 
[00:13:30]  That's what Newark is for.  Man, I will suck your dick.  Get off the highway in Newark someday.  Yeah, that city's really becoming a great metropolis.  Anyone want a burger?  Holy ass.  That's what Newark is for.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Break yourself, nigga.  Break yourself.  Love that movie.  What is that?  Menace to Society.  Yeah, that's a great one.  I'm just hanging up on people because it's easier, so don't get insulted. 
[00:14:00]  They're all like, whatever.  I'm sure they're going, hof!  Hoof!  I was hung up on!  Hoof!  I'm insulted!  Well, I...  Well, I never!  Rob, uh, Norton already said that.  She...  Indeed!  She...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't...  She...  Yeah.  That's a trooper.  And then you kissed.  She...  And then we...  And then you cuddled.  Ah, and then we...  Kissing, cuddling.  Was there any small talk going on? 
[00:14:30]  Any, like, little small talk?  I just kept telling how beautiful she was.  It was a nice experience, so it wasn't very much small talk, and I guess she was fighting  revulsion.  She had her face in my neck.  It was nice.  Yeah.  All right.  That's very good.  We'll get her review, hopefully, a little later when she wakes up.  Yeah, she can be honest, you know.  You know.  After she gets out of the shower that she's been taking for 24 hours, with the money that  she got up in a display case, so there's a constant reminder that that's what she did  it for.  There was no money.  It was just a friendly exchange between two people.  Nothing, actually.  After she gets hosed down. 
[00:15:00]  Like seeing in Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, do they have a room to hose them down after they're done with that?  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  Jesus.  Big fire hose on her back.  Right.  Trying to wash the jimmy off of her.  Let's play 1964.  Hmm.  No?  Almost.  Oh, it's all right.  I didn't get it.  It was almost there.  That's all right.  It was still...  Set the dogs on them, too.  Okay.  No?  Well, yeah, actually. 
[00:15:30]  I don't think there was something there.  A little some.  Sweet oral pleasure.  Such a talented little heroin addict.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  Oh, dear.  Overdose.  Ramon.  Get the wood chip.  Adventures in time and space.  Then here.  Then again.  Live.

[00:17:30]  XM 202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Hey, you're listening to The OPN Anthony Show.  You know that by now.  It says it right on your stupid XM unit there, right?  Do you know what I used to do to make my cat look?  I would do this on paper.  No one could hear you scratching the paper.  You're scratching the paper.  That was a horrendous visual.  Hold on.  This is what I would do to make my cat look.  I would go.  Ooh.  On a piece of paper?  No, no, no.  It was my cock against his tongue.  Oh.  A little rough. 
[00:18:00]  You got to go.  You guys want to see a paper cut?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Stop it.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  Can you imagine doing that across the hole of your dick?

It's the worst of OPN Anthony.  You want to do this Groton Man story real fast? 
[00:18:30]  That's what we're getting into.  Oh, everyone can understand this.  Anyone who's been married.  And this guy was married for 29 years.  29 years.  The guy was 51 years.  Is 51 years old.  Married 29 years.  Do a little math, Opie.  29 years?  How old was he when he got married?  How old is he now?  51.  Married 29 years. 
[00:19:00]  He got married too young.  So, now, you're a 22-year-old guy.  You should not be getting married at 22 years old.  What?  23?  23.  I'm sorry.  Look at us with our math skills.  Wait, how old is he?  Well, it's subtraction.  That is a tough one.  Wait, how old is he?  51.  And he got married at 22.  That's 29 years.  Why are you saying 23 years?  Yeah, why are you saying 23?  I swear to God.  He jumps in with a correction, and it's wrong. 
[00:19:30]  My English stinks, and your math stinks.  No, no, no.  I forgot to put it on the other side.  All right.  I practiced the puts all weekend long.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So, you know, you're 22 years, 21 years old.  How old?  22 years old.  And now, from 22 to 51, you have this woman that is just telling you what to do all the  time, ragging you.  And he finally lost his mind.  A Groton man, Groton, Connecticut, charged with murder in the death of his wife, told police 
[00:20:00]  that he ran her over in their driveway because she berated and nagged him.  Berated and nagged him.  But that happens.  Let him off.  But that happens to a lot of couples.  It does.  It certainly does.  And this guy couldn't take it anymore.  His description is classic of what happened.  Blakeslee, 51, said that on September 10th, his wife, Christine, nagged him about a motor 
[00:20:30]  vehicle ticket he'd received several weeks earlier.  Okay.  I'm starting to feel this story.  He said his wife of 29 years would not drop the matter.  Oh, have you been in this, people?  How many times have I told you to slow down?  They're going to take it, but you won't slow down.  Yeah.  What happens?  When does it turn into this, by the way?  I don't know.  You always, like, I don't know, you start dating someone, it's all about sex, and you can't  do no wrong, she can't do no wrong. 
[00:21:00]  But slowly but surely, all, like, relationships creep into this type of a situation.  Opie, this is after 29 years.  That's what I mean, but it slowly creeps.  You don't really notice it happening, you know?  I was in a relationship for a while.  I'm not going to, no, no, I'm not going to mention any names.  I'm going to go get coffee.  Who, what, where, no names or anything.  But I got to tell you, being ragged on and bitched at is not a fun thing.  Like not doing your vacuuming before I pick you up?  Right.  All that kind of fun stuff. 
[00:21:30]  I used to, oh, wow.  I want, no, no, no.  Can I tell one story?  Why?  I used to, Ed and I used to commute, because we lived in the same town when we first moved  back to New York.  Beautiful Huntington, New York.  Yeah, and I picked up Anthony, you know, and we'd take turns, like, commuting in and  taking turns driving and stuff.  I'll drive today.  And I would pick up Anthony around, I don't know, let's say about 10.  It was pretty accurate, right?  After rush hour, we decided to come in for our afternoon show, get some things done, maybe  meetings, whatever.  And I'm thinking, Anthony is not a morning person, so if I'm picking him up at 10, he had to 
[00:22:00]  have gotten up maybe 9, 9, 15.  Yep.  Seriously.  Absolutely.  And I would pick up Anthony, and this was more than once.  Like, Anthony would be at the front door, and his ex would be yelling and screaming at  him.  Yeah.  Yelling and screaming at him.  And I would get pissed off, and he would get in the car, and I'm like, what could you  have possibly done wrong?  I know you've only been up for 45 minutes, maybe an hour.  You know how much stuff you could do wrong in 45 minutes?  Are you kidding?  Do you know the earth-shattering messes you can concoct in 45 minutes? 
[00:22:30]  I remember one time, it was because you didn't vacuum.  I used to smile when I walked out to get into that car to come to work.  Oh, when I smile, I was done for the day.  And then...  Opie and his Funmobile showing up at your house, like, whew!  Yeah.  Whew!  Here we go.  And then after the show, I would hang out and play video games until all hours of the  night.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[00:23:00]  You know what?  I know.  Yeah.  No.  Meeting.  I got a takeaway.  Yeah, another meeting.  Oh, this one's going on and on.  I don't know, you know, we got to meet with people again.  You know, we got in trouble, but I'll be home.  I'll be...  I'll be home in, like, November.  Is that okay?  Why did I pick the month it is?  What an idiot.  What a fucking idiot.  And none of us noticed.  Well, this bit, the day is September 19th.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  But I remember one time you came into the car.  I'm like, what did you do wrong?  Well, I was supposed to vacuum before I left for work today.  I think I was supposed to take out the garbage.  Or something.  I think that was it.  I think that was my job.  All right.  Something like that.  But I won't mention any names of this relationship, but it was just a constant ragging.  And there were times where we would go out.  And this girl, this girl would get a little intoxicated.  Hopi.  A little drunk.  Sorry.  I had something in my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  And I would say, before we even went out, I would say, look.  I'm going to check my messages.  I think someone might have called while we were on break.  Please.  I'm begging you.  Even after you're drunk, try to keep this in your head.  Whatever you're going to start arguing about isn't important and does not need to be pursued.  Does not even need.  So we're going out to have fun.  It's going to be fun.  Let's go out.  I'll tip a few back.  But keep it light and airy and fun.  Sure. 
[00:24:30]  There's nothing to argue about.  There's nothing to argue about right now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So nothing important is going to happen while we're out drinking.  So let's remember that and keep it.  Let's fast forward four hours.  I'll say four hours.  You motherfucker.  No, no.  Because you don't clean.  I do every fucking thing.  And I'm like, remember the conversation? 
[00:25:00]  Do you remember?  Just fuck yourself.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm going to be sitting over here for a while.  I'm in the living room.  This is unbelievable.  And, you know, occasionally you do get it in your mind.  If she was in front of my car, would I put it in drive, as this gentleman in this article did,  and maybe hit the gas.  We're getting back to that story.  Oh, that's where we were the whole time.  Oh, okay.  Well, can I ask a question?  Yes.  If you're dating someone and you feel that they're drinking too much, 
[00:25:30]  wouldn't you say, like, maybe you shouldn't drink before we go out?  No.  No, no.  Can I say something else?  If she's not drinking, can I add?  And I'm not drinking.  And I had a drink.  Can I say something else?  Yeah.  She would call while we were on the air because it was happy hour time.  Because we did three to seven.  And I remember phone calls where you would beg her not to get too drunk before you got there.  No shots.  No shots till I get there.  And it's this big radio star, and he's begging this certain individual not to get too hammered before he got there. 
[00:26:00]  I had to.  Christine Blakeslee, 54, was bitching about the parking ticket he'd received several weeks earlier.  He said his wife, 29 years, would not drop the matter, so he decided to get in his truck and leave.  It's a pretty rational thing for a guy to do, leave the situation.  Christine Blakeslee, the wife, followed him, climbed up on the running board.  He drove the truck in reverse, causing his wife to fall. 
[00:26:30]  Now, under normal circumstances, that would be a wake-or-upper right there.  You'd go, holy jeez, she just fell off the running board.  Things got out of hand.  Let me see if she's okay.  You know, she was ragging me and stuff.  Things got out of hand.  Now, this should pretty much take care of the problem.  He's quoted as saying, I stopped at the truck and looked out in front of me.  Picture this scene.  Blakeslee said in his statement, my wife was there in the headlights. 
[00:27:00]  She was kneeling with her hands in front of her.  Small pause.  I stepped on the gas.  How great is that?  I stepped on the gas.  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop. 
[00:27:30]  I didn't think about the consequences.  He just wanted to make it stop.  That voice in his head.  Just make it stop.  That voice.  Parking ticket.  Back, back.  Stop.  Back.  I told you.  I told you so.  Just holding on to the running board.  Probably turned and looked at her face pressed against the window.  What are you doing?  I told you.  Where are you going?  Get back here.  I stepped on the gas. 
[00:28:00]  She never looked up.  I just wanted to make her stop.  I didn't think about the consequences.  I heard a thud.  Then I thought I heard her scream.  I didn't stop right away.  I stopped when it came to me that I hit her.  I kept thinking, oh my God.  I just killed my wife.  He said he returned to the house.  And what did he do afterwards, Opie?  Did he call 911?  Did he check on her? 
[00:28:30]  Did he freak out?  He went to sleep.  He finally got sleep.  It was finally quiet.  First night of peaceful sleep.  And I'll tell you another.  Wait, she's like just dead in the driveway?  She's dead in the driveway.  And he's like.  He's snoozing away.  Let me tell you another treat that some guys have to go through.  The I gotta go to sleep, but there's a fight going on.  You're in bed.  You have to get up for work.  You're in bed.  Is this a real story? 
[00:29:00]  Trying to sleep.  Or is this something that you've heard?  Let's just say I might be familiar with this certain situation.  All right.  I'm going to go sit back over here for a while.  There's been a drunken argument.  You're trying to rationalize, but it's like rationalizing with a pumpkin or a porcupine or a cactus.  You know, try to rationalize with it.  It's not going to listen.  So you finally decide it's time for bed.  It's time for bed.  You gotta sleep.  My God, you gotta sleep.  It's six in the morning and you're going to bed. 
[00:29:30]  Climb into bed.  You're all aggravated, but maybe you can just relax long enough and go to sleep.  From downstairs.  Fucking idiot.  Son of a bitch.  Why the...  Son of a...  Frick.  God damn son of a bitch.  I'll never listen to a fucking word.  I say it.  Son...  Motherfucker.  Now you're trying to sleep.  Oh, yes.  Even Jim's uncomfortable.  Now you're trying to sleep.  And this is all going on and you're trying. 
[00:30:00]  I hate these stories.  And you think in your head,  Do I just lay here and hopefully fall asleep?  Or...  Or...  It's a fine line.  Do I wake up and continue this argument that now we'll put it into hyperdrive?  Can I throw something else into this mix?  Yes.  Yes.  When that's going on and you're upstairs,  Part of you's got to be thinking,  She might stab me.  Yeah.  There were some times you would actually think something might happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All kinds of thoughts go through your head.  But you know the best thing is to stay in bed and try to go to sleep. 
[00:30:30]  Because you've tried them all before.  You tried all the...  You get up and continue trying to rationalize.  It just goes on and on.  It doesn't end.  And then, when you finally do sleep,  And she sleeps and everyone wakes up,  It never happened.  Hey, how you doing?  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  You're living with... 
[00:31:00]  What's her name from misery?  And then...  Oh.  Kathy Bates.  Yeah, Kathy Bates.  Hey.  A young person.  Kathy Bates.  Morning.  Morning.  Oh, you.  And you're like,  Where's Opie?  Beat the horn, Opie.  Please.  Honk, honk.  Oh, I gotta go.  Oh, it's time for work.  You know I was your savior, right?  Why are you leaving at 8 a.m.?  You haven't acknowledged lately that I was your savior.  What?  You just haven't acknowledged it lately.  I want to hear it today.  I'd have probably left sooner if it wasn't for you and Sandy. 
[00:31:30]  I was your savior.  I'm not going to say that.  You were my savior as far as work goes.  Get me this kick-ass job in radio.  But I brought fun back into your life.  I'm really assessing this.  Hold on.  You gave me the cool job in radio.  No, just the opportunity.  And the rest is history.  Having nothing to do with any relationships I've been in.  I don't think that really fits, Opie. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know, because I don't think you would ever get divorced.  Are you insane?  Well, you talked about how, like, you couldn't get divorced for a while there.  Why?  Wait, how many...  Didn't you want to get divorced way before you did?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And I didn't because I had a kick-ass job in radio.  Hmm.  I don't get it.  Well, it was just kind of a good distraction.  Well, that's what I mean.  I was your savior.  Or my curse.  If you think of it that way, I would have been out of it. 
[00:32:30]  You think?  Perhaps earlier.  It was a good distraction.  I was having a good time away from the house.  Well, that's what I mean by the savior part.  I gave you a nice distraction.  Because it's blood on your hands and on your feet, stigmata?  My savior?  Well, no, this is what the point I'm getting at is that I think I know you well enough to  know that you realized early on that you weren't in the greatest relationship, right?  Yeah.  But you also had a shitty job.  So you had a shitty job, then you had this going on at home.  Yeah.  But then you got into radio, so at least it gave you fun, fun, fun. 
[00:33:00]  And a distraction.  I think I'd have walked away from the entire situation earlier, the job, the woman, everything,  if I was still in that crappy job.  Okay.  I think it would have really...  Who knows?  So what happened to the Blakesleys?  By the way, can I say that Robert Blake's wife's last name was Blakely?  How coincidental is that?  None whatsoever.  Not funny or interesting either.  As I said it, good job, flow stopper.  An autopsy report ruled Christine Blakesley, a death, ruled her death a homicide, saying 
[00:33:30]  she died of blunt, forced chest trauma.  Oh, man.  Oh, hit her right in the chest with a bumper.  Not only did he hit her, he hit her.  He's like, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to make it look good.  He went to the house, went to sleep, told police he woke up, checked the driveway, saw  his wife was still there, and called 911.  I didn't want to face what happened, he said.  I was hoping it was all a bad dream.  Yeah, a 29-year bad dream.  She jumped on the running board.  She's bitching about a ticket. 
[00:34:00]  You fucking bitch.  And he realized he'd killed his wife.  He tried to commit suicide by drinking and taking Tylenol.  What's that going to do?  In his second version, he told police he woke up early in the morning, heard a car breaking,  then a thud, looked out a window, and saw a light-colored car driving away.  Lately, he told police he returned to bed and noticed that his wife was gone. 
[00:34:30]  He said he found her dead in the driveway.  How are you going to say that when there's a dent in your car because you hit your wife?  Her hair is in your bumper.  What a foolish thing.  At least say you saw a light-colored car with a black guy in it driving away.  Oh, it wasn't in Boston.  Okay.  It was in Connecticut.  I am sorry.  I didn't want to kill her.  I just wanted her to stop.  That's what it says.  Ladies?  There's some thinking. 
[00:35:00]  Are you an egg?  Are you ragging your husband?  Are you constantly just pecking away at his head?  But in the beginning, it's just not like that.  But something happens slowly but surely, and then you wake up one day and realize,  oh, my God, I'm in a nightmare.  Opie, sometimes you can find the right person you get along with, you can chat with,  and it's wonderful.  But when you're in a situation, you're in a relationship like that, you've got to get out.  You've got to run because it's going to end up, she will either kill you through the nagging 
[00:35:30]  or you will see her in the headlights, on her knees, hands in front of her,  and you know what choice you'll make?  The little skinny pedal on the right.  We haven't played this in a couple days.  We're not going to break, though.  I just want to play this really fast.  Oh, I love this.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  I'm going to bring a little coffee.  How do you like that?  Stop it. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, that's great.  You wouldn't get away with it here.  But you should.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  She spilled my coffee.  The little laugh is the greatest.  The little chuckle, because he knows what's coming.  He's laughing because he's the only one that knows what's coming.  I'm sorry, sir.  That coffee-spilling bitch has no clue she's getting that in the face.  Her just desserts.  Janine, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I just want to say that you guys are making me want to leave my husband out of an act of mercy. 
[00:36:30]  Why?  Do you rag him?  I hate me right now.  Are you a rag, a nag?  I don't want to be.  I don't want to be.  I don't think I have a choice, though.  It's in our nature.  Why?  Why don't you have a choice?  Because he's a guy, and he does stupid guy things, and I just can't let go.  Sometimes those stupid guy things we do at the beginning of the relationship were called cute.  Yeah, they were called cute, and I used to want to keep him in my closet and take him out and look at him because he was so funny, and now I just want to lock him in there. 
[00:37:00]  And I'm sure he wants to kill me half the time.  And the things you guys rag about, they used to not be that big an issue.  And then slowly they become this big issue that needs to be addressed on a minutely basis.  Your clothes are on the floor.  I suck.  They totally suck.  And on Halloween, I was jumping up and down yelling because he refused to put on his mask.  I'm a dick.  See, those are things.  If you don't want to put on a mask, he don't put on a mask. 
[00:37:30]  You know what?  I used to get ragged at all the time at weddings.  Come on.  Let's dance.  Let's get up and dance.  And I'm like, I don't want to dance.  I want to sit here.  I want to finish my drink, and I just want to sit here and watch everyone else dance because they look like drunken buffoons.  Get up and dance.  Why don't you ever dance?  And then the arm pull where you've got to hold onto your seat.  Now it's assault.  I don't want to dance.  And it's just ragged.  Neek, neek, neek. 
[00:38:00]  Pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick, pick.  Pick, pick, pick.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting uncomfortable.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I hate these flashbacks.  I just hate.  This is the only time.  Poor guy doesn't want to put his mask on, and you're yelling at him.  Yelling at him.  What kind of mask was it?  What kind of mask?  It was a stupid burglar mask.  It was the only thing I could get him to wear because it was cheap and easy.  But he's a musician, and I try to do everything for him.  So then when it's my time, I have to insist that it goes my way, and I'm just an asshole.  What kind of burglar mask?  Like one around the eyes or one around the mouth? 
[00:38:30]  It was ridiculous.  Like a hamburglar?  I think every marriage should end after seven years.  Think seven years?  Seven years.  That's it.  I think there should be an option.  Like you go a few years, and you have an option to re-up your marriage license.  You've got to get it.  You know, it could expire.  You laugh, but it's not a bad idea.  If both parties are in agreeance, you re-up your marriage license for another couple of years.  Instead of like signing that marriage certificate, and now you're stuck for life because all the women get all the money and stuff when you do finally divorce. 
[00:39:00]  You can't get a lifetime fishing license.  Right.  And that's for a fish.  Right.  But you could get a wife, and it's a lifetime license.  That never expires.  Who stays in one job for 40 years?  No one.  Exactly.  Why do you have to stay with the same person for 40 years?  You do.  Because you said it.  Marriage in this day and age just doesn't make sense anymore.  No.  It just doesn't.  Thanks to you guys, I'm going to drive away, and I'm never going to look back, and he'll hear it on the replay.  And, honey, I'm sorry I'm doing this because I love you. 
[00:39:30]  Do you like sucking?  I'm going.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, leave him alone, man.  Or be a friend.  Be a chick that's interesting.  Do something like cup of fart and throw it in his face.  He'll love you for that.  Do something silly.  There you go.  I learn to gag more.  Nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  We like when you gag just a little bit.  You should have said, put the mask on, honey.  Hobble.  Yeah.  I told you the girl that would put the bucket by the side of my...  Yes.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, Janine.  I learn to gag.  Thank you.  Oh, you remember the ice cream.  Good memory.  I like Anthony's... 
[00:40:00]  I like your suggestion there, man.  Yeah.  Have a whole license, a renewal thing.  Have a marriage license with an expiration.  It's not a bad idea.  Let's say hi to Keith in Cincinnati.  How about those Bengals, Keith, huh?  That looked good yesterday, again.  Very good.  They kicked the Cowboys' ass 26-3.  Well, maybe if we didn't have a 50-year-old quarterback, that wouldn't happen.  Well, you guys got rid of the Coke guy.  I didn't.  Parcells did.  That's dope.  What was his name again?  Quincy Carter.  Yeah, Quincy.  Vinny with three interceptions.  Vinny stinks.  Dude, we knew Vinny was awful when he was with the Jets. 
[00:40:30]  That's how you build an offense.  Take someone from the Jets.  What's the matter?  Wasn't Daryl Stingley available?  Wow.  Wow.  But he's in a wheelchair, Jimmy.  Yeah, I was calling just to relate.  You're talking about nagging women.  I'm getting ready to go through a divorce myself, and I was married to the naggingest bitch  on the face of the earth.  Yeah, but it didn't, hold on, but it didn't start like that, right?  I'm sorry?  It didn't start like that, right? 
[00:41:00]  I still didn't pick that up.  Your line is really distorting on my end.  Your relationship didn't start like that with her nagging.  Oh, hell no, no.  Maybe this guy needs to be nagged, too.  You just got to tell him three fucking times.  He doesn't listen.  I can relate to the right pedal versus the middle pedal.  Trust me, I can relate to it, but I would never take it that far.  So when did you realize that the nagging was definitely a problem?  Because I bet you at first there's a little nag that comes your way, but you're like, eh, 
[00:41:30]  whatever.  Yeah, all right.  Maybe she could take it.  Maybe she just had a bad day.  I could take it.  What?  I thought it was hormone swings from the pregnancy.  She got pregnant early on.  I thought it was just that.  After she had the baby, she stayed a bitch, so it wasn't that.  Yeesh.  Ugh.  You should be able to get out of this stuff without a lawyer getting involved, man.  Now she's a mom with her stupid socks pulled up over the stretchy pants.  I was going to see it last week, and you had me.  Fat whore.  With that little story about getting raped, you know, a $60,000 a year, taking half of it.  You know, you got me worried the best now.  Thanks.  I appreciate that, guys. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, Keith.  Good luck to you there, huh?  Thank you.  Have a good one.  I don't know where this guy's going, but we'll see.  Bill in Boston, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How about those socks?  How about the Pats?  You got to congratulate him on the Pats.  I already did the Pats.  Yeah, you got to do it again.  I got to do it again.  Pats beat the Rams 40 to 22.  Ugh.  Who cares?  Go ahead.  Ian, I don't know if you can, like, how much can you talk about your divorce?  Like, was there any agreement in the settlement or anything like that?  I'm just talking about general relationships, sir.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I think Anthony speaks freely.  That's it.  Well, I wanted to ask you, like, out of all the lawyers in New York, why would she hire Dominic  Barbara, who's associated with Howard?  Yeah, and then the company doesn't understand why we hate Howard and we should get along with  him.  Yeah, okay.  I would guess, you know, I don't know why, but I would guess because it's, you know, one  of those great little tactics.  It just, it puts the fear of things being in the public eye on someone else's radio show.  It, you know, he's known for being a pretty good divorce lawyer, too. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  All right.  There you go.  Well, that's that, then.  There it is.  Huh?  Here it is.  What?  There it is.  There it is.  Okay.  We got Tony Danza outtakes.  Outtakes?  Outtakes.  You mean, uh, applause breaks?  No, these are outtakes.  Outtakes from?  From doing promos for a show.  How do we get these?  We don't want to tell anyone how we got these.  We are entrenched. 
[00:43:30]  We're well connected in this city.  That's great.  We got outtakes of Tony Danza trying to do some promos.  Right, Steve?  We're going to take a break first.  Nice.  Don't say where you got it from, because this guy could be a goldmine.  What is that hat you're wearing?  What's on the side of that one?  It's flames.  Something with a flame on it.  And a skull on one side.  Exactly.  Flames and skull.  That's why you were able to wear the shirt with nothing on it.  Exactly.  I had to compensate.  Yeah.  I had to compensate with the hat.  I like it.  You think about what you're going to wear every day.  Well, to the extent this.  Because you fold up your sleeves perfectly. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Just like two and a half times on each side.  The most disgusted look from Norton right now.  It's just the hat.  Oh, okay.  No, I can't say where we got it, but...  I can't even listen to you talk anymore, because of Norton.  Why?  Yes?  Go ahead.  I can't say where we got it.  What exactly is the audio?  Oh, the audio.  It's Outtakes.  Are you playing it?  Pardon me. 
[00:44:30]  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Oh, it is.  So, we got this audio from what?  A very nice person.  All right.  Cool.  You came in for that?  I was told to come into the studio.  I don't really know what the hell I was talking about.  I can't hear you guys in the other room, by the way.  So, I'm yelled at to get into the studio.  What are you working on today for the show?  What I handed you, and then some more audio of a pre-interview from that show.  Is that good?  I don't know yet.  It's dumping into Pro Tools right now.  All right.  Are you letting your hair grow back, or are you going to keep it short?  I'm going to let it grow back. 
[00:45:00]  It's cool, short.  Thank you, sir.  I like it.  Thank you.  Yeah, I like it.  It's growing in.  And it's growing in at the same rate as his sideburns.  Exactly.  Uniformity.  Pork chop sideburns.  Dude, you were that kid in school, man.  You grow that crap in a day.  Yeah, I was at 12.  I had sideburns.  He was a 5 o'clock shadow guy.  He's Lebanese.  We all had one of those guys in school growing up.  My buddy, Joe Curry, was a foot.  Plank foot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He was that guy.  He actually got thrown out of the school one day, and he was going to the school.  They were convinced he wasn't a student. 
[00:45:30]  And he was telling them, no, I go here.  And they just kept ushering him out the door, because he had a full beard.  I mean, like, ridiculous, full Grizzly Adams beard.  And what was he, like, 15 years old?  He was, no, it was his senior year, so he was, you know, 17, 18.  The type of guy that gets served when he's, like, 16, right?  Oh, yeah.  He was buying beers for us.  You know, he was the great guy to have around, because he could go in and buy beers.  They wouldn't proof him.  All right.  Mark wants in.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just signed my divorce papers two weeks ago. 
[00:46:00]  Congratulations.  Bro, you know what I'm saying?  I would bust my ass, take clients out after work.  I'd get home at 3 in the morning, have to be back in my office at 6.30, so enough time  for a half-hour nap and a shower.  Right.  And he would bitch.  And bitch.  Meanwhile, all day, she was sitting at Americana Shopping Center, spending the money I fucking  made on a little Prada shoes.  There you go.  So, you know what?  They nag and they nag.  Yep.  And you know what?  I can understand why somebody wants to run their wife over.  You know, for that little minute where she's just glimmering in the headlights, for that 
[00:46:30]  split second, where any rational-thinking human being would say, no, and you put it in  park and go, what am I thinking?  But there's that one little moment.  Well, you want to tell them, put your head by the hood.  See if you hear that noise?  Could you listen?  I hear a clicking.  Right.  Right.  What is that?  Bam.  That's it.  It's over.  All right.  Thank you, man.  The show's great.  Poor bastard.  The marriage was going well, but I was drinking consistently on the road.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jim's smart, though. 
[00:47:00]  He knows he can't hear it.  Oh, very good.  All right.  Mr. Smarty Pants.  One more.  We got to go to Phoenix.  Say hi to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  By the way, as I'm putting income in the bank week after week, I was told, I was told  I couldn't get a cell phone.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do, Anthony.  I want a cell phone.  Just like you.  You don't need a cell phone.  Just like your pal, Opie.  I think I was a bad influence on you.  You don't need a cell phone.  All of us was a cell phone. 
[00:47:30]  I remember you guys got an argument.  You don't need a cell phone.  I want a cell phone.  What if there's an emergency?  Well, you know, you can get a car phone, like a big unit that goes in the car, but no  cell phone.  Son of a bitch.  And then you got to weigh.  You got to weigh it.  Do I be a man and get the cell phone and say, go fuck yourself?  Or do I not have to deal with an argument now because of this?  What was the problem with the cell phone?  There has to be a reason.  What?  There has to be some rational reason?  Wait a minute, Opie. 
[00:48:00]  Have you been listening?  There has to be a reason for some of this stuff?  I thought there might have been a reason that was told to you.  A reason?  Yeah.  Like a legitimate argument, a legitimate other side, other view that would then be focused  back to me that I would then.  What?  People thought we were rock stars.  And you're having these arguments behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Over our cell phone.  Wow.  The only rocking I was doing was in my own feces as I was trying to figure out how I  would get out of this.  Please.  There was nothing going on. 
[00:48:30]  And you did quite well for yourself, my friend.  I was able to come.  You know something?  Like the sad clown, I was able to come in on a daily basis and make people laugh, though  I cried inside.  Oh, they laughed and they laughed and they laughed.  Though I cried inside.  Oh, my God.  John the trucker.  We've got to take a break, but John, go ahead.  Is my mic on?  Should be.  I was just going to make a suggestion.  Can you hear me, fella?  How you can keep the second wife from nagging.  Oh, shit.  Is this today's problem?  John, can you hear Norton? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  John, if I ask you a question right now, you can hear me.  I can hear you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Then it was that guy's problem.  No problemo.  All right, go ahead, John.  I was just going to tell you how to keep the second wife from nagging.  You shoot and kill the first one.  I like it.  Yeah, a little warning.  He's not kidding.  Why would you even have a second wife?  I could not imagine getting married the second time.  Just don't happen.  You met your second wife while you were in prison?  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  For killing your first wife?  Right.  You really killed your first wife?  I shot her with a bitch right through the fucking head.  All right, hold on.  We're not taking a break any time soon.  Now, I...  Dude, he's a trucker.  You've got to believe him.  Now, what were these circumstances?  And how did you get out of jail?  I was 15 to life.  I got out in 15 years.  I thought this guy was just a little cute little joke.  How do you keep your second wife from nagging you?  You killed the first one. 
[00:50:00]  You killed the first one.  Ha, ha, ha.  A little joke.  Thank you.  And then, you're listening to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Dude, you've got to tell us what happened.  And give me the story of what happened leading up to and after killing your wife.  Yeah, let's back up here.  What led up to it?  What did she do to deserve this?  Well, we were both doing acid.  We was all fucked up.  Oh, my God.  We're talking to Charlie Manson.  Kept nagging me.  Kept nagging me.  I come on board one day.  I was all fucked up on acid.  She started eating.  I just blowed her fucking head off. 
[00:50:30]  She was ragging.  Do you remember...  Hey, John, do you remember what she was nagging you about?  Oh, she was nagging about my coming in late and shit.  I got off work at four in the afternoon.  I wanted to get home until like 11, 12 o'clock at night.  What were you doing?  You never spend no time with me.  You never do this.  You never do that.  See, look at what it got her.  Bitch, you never spend time with me.  How old a guy are you, John?  Do what?  How old are you?  Right now, I'm 49.  49. 
[00:51:00]  Okay, so you decided to kill her.  So what did you do?  You grabbed your shotgun?  Come on.  No, I always carried the pistol on me.  I lived back in Kansas back there.  So you always had a pistol on you, and you just leveled it at her and shot her in the head?  Shot her right between the fucking eyes.  Was she surprised?  A little bit.  Did she look...  Well, if she was so surprised or she just amazed, I'd do it. 
[00:51:30]  What size gun was it, sir?  22.  Oh, wow.  That gives them a little time to think about it.  Oh, Jesus.  Was she alive after you shot her?  No, 22 does better, really, than it's a head wound.  You think so?  It ricochets around.  Kind of bounces around in the brain pan a little bit?  So then...  Yeah, kind of scrambles it rather than...  All right.  ... completely through it.  So then she...  Did she live through the initial blast?  No.  She was dead.  She dropped dead right there on the spot.  I sat down and smoked a joint and called the cops.  Told them I killed her. 
[00:52:00]  They come out and pick my ass up.  Send somebody.  I think I killed Doyle.  Eating potatoes?  That's what that buddy of mine said.  He goes, that sounds like something out of that fucking sling blade.  Poor little feller.  All right.  So then they arrested you, and you were convicted?  Oh, no.  And you only got 15 to life?  15 to life out of it.  And how many years did you serve?  I'm sorry, you both talked at the same time. 
[00:52:30]  Sorry.  How much time did you serve?  15 years.  15 years.  Sir, I have to ask you the question now.  You're out.  You're a trucker.  Was it worth it?  Yeah.  Because I didn't pay no fucking support.  It was worth it.  He spent 15 years in prison for killing his wife, and he says it was worth it.  How did you break that news to your second wife? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, she knew about it.  I just told her to read this newspaper article, told her the dates, stuff.  She pulled it up and looked at it.  See, all right.  I got to tell you what's going on in the studio.  Jim was not buying this story when we started, right?  Not at all.  I want to put this guy on hold.  I want to get his last name.  I want to see if we can find an article on this.  Oh, yeah.  Your name would pop up in the news, right?  It should.  It was a long time ago, but it should.  All right.  You know what?  Can you hold on through the break? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  We got to see if this is real.  John the trucker killed his wife.  Wait.  We could ask him one other thing.  Give me John for a second.  And then he did 15 years to life.  So, John, your second wife started writing you in prison?  Yeah.  She started writing me when I put my name in Easy Rider magazine.  You know, that mail call.  Right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll get the second part of your story next.  So, he had his name in Easy Rider. 
[00:54:00]  Easy Rider.  And she started writing him in prison.  And then he gets out 15 years later, and they get married.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Obviously, you'll stick around, because we've got to get the second part of this story in  just a minute here.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  It's M202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good old Mr. B retires.  Tom Brokaw retired from everything. 
[00:54:30]  He was the anchorman.  And he finally retired.  What do you think he's doing in retirement now, as we look back here?  I'm relaxing.  Taking it easy.  It's got to suck.  Tom Brokaw, you reported all the heavy, heavy news that hit us in this generation.  And now, what do you think he's doing?  Seriously, did he take up badminton or something?  He would love to have talked about the bombings in London, but nothing.  He had to sit there and watch it on television. 
[00:55:00]  I bet he pontificates around his friends and annoys them.  Like, something happened.  He goes, well, you know, and I think, no, and nor do we care.  No one cares, Tom.  This is what I think of Tom Brokaw.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  You had nothing.  Fucking girl farts.  Nothing came out.  What was that?  I had something, but I figured if I pushed a little harder, oh, it was going to all come  out.  I think Tom Brokaw's a turtle.  If I pushed it any harder, I would have been playing bingo in my underpants. 
[00:55:30]  This is what I think of Tom Brokaw.  I'm shitting myself.  That's right.  That's right.  Tom Brokaw looks like rice pudding.  Tom Brokaw retires.  We discuss it.  Check it out.  Laser sounds right here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Well, last night was a very sad day, Anthony.  Oh, sad.  Very sad day in broadcasting.  Yes.  It was Tom Brokaw's last night.  Yeah.  Doing the NBC nightly news.  You got to give it to the guy.  Pretty dignified.  I think he, uh... 
[00:56:00]  I liked him the best out of the three.  No real scandals involving him.  Peter Jennings.  Involving him.  Peter Jennings is good.  Smooth.  He's a liberal douche.  Huh?  Peter Jennings is a liberal douche.  He's a Canadian.  Yeah, of course.  Well, I, you know, there's Tom right now as we talk about him.  Doing his last broadcast.  Saying goodnight for the last time.  So, uh, he did his last broadcast last night. 
[00:56:30]  Getting a little choked up, a little teary-eyed.  It was pretty much Tom Brokaw Day all day long on NBC yesterday.  On NBC.  Isn't that funny when they do, when that happens?  The other stations just don't even hit on it.  But it's the hugest news ever on Channel 4 and NBC stations.  Oh, they go in for the close-up to see his, uh, teary eyes.  Watch his mouth just acrobatics trying to wrap his lips around the words.  So there was an uncomfortable moment on the Today Show yesterday morning.  Oh, they figured they would break out the champagne. 
[00:57:00]  And, uh, the Today Show, Tom started on the Today Show years ago.  He was on there.  And they figured they would, uh, give him a little toast.  A little send-off.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy starts, like, getting all choked up.  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  It's like watching your dad get all choked up.  Thank God we'll never get to that point.  Huh?  We'll never get to that point where we know it's our last broadcast.  No, no.  We get thrown off.  Yeah, you know, we'll go out in a blaze of glory, thank God, because I don't want to 
[00:57:30]  be, like, old and have to look at Anthony for the last time and go, this is the last  time I'm going to see you.  This is the last show.  Right.  I remember when we started.  Whip him out Wednesday.  It's safe to say that'll never happen.  Nah.  We will blow this up again, and that'll be it.  That's the way to go out.  We get, uh, we get fired in our prime.  You don't want anyone telling you it's over.  You just want to blow it up yourself. 
[00:58:00]  Have to look at Slappy and Wappy waiting to take your seat the next day.  Yeah.  Young go-getters.  Hey, O&A, big fans, grew up listening to you guys.  It's going to be so exciting to take your places.  That's very good.  Let me give you boys some advice.  Yeah, yeah, great, great, great.  Okay, yeah, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Right, right, right.  Could you just, uh, you know, get your seat out of here?  It smells like hemorrhoid cream.  Oh, you got to be that guy.  It's like that movie with, uh, Jack Nicklaus, uh...  Jack Nicholson.  Uh, Nicholson, sorry.  No, uh, um... 
[00:58:30]  I just watched it last night.  About Schmidt?  Holy S.  Dude, that movie's so depressing...  I know.  ...that I laugh really hard.  It's horrible.  I look at that as a comedy.  It's a horrible movie.  It's hilarious.  He's retiring, and his life is just, like, a waste, and...  He's retiring, and they throw him the retirement dinner, and they give him a stupid watch, and  the new guy, that's what it reminds me of.  The young go-getter.  The young go-getter's waiting to take over for him, and he was, you know, he was the center 
[00:59:00]  of attention, has a retirement party, and everything's great, and then remember when  he has nothing to do, and he goes back to the office, and he's trying to teach the go-getter  how it's done, and give him some advice, and just like you said, the go-getter's like,  yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, whatever, whatever, and then he leaves the office, and he sees  all the files that he collected for, like, 20, 30 years in the dumpster.  Yep.  Dude, I laughed so freaking hard at that.  During the dumpster?  I don't remember that part.  Oh, he walks past the, you know, he leaves the office after trying to give this new kid  some advice, how the job's done and stuff, because he has all this expertise and knowledge 
[00:59:30]  that he built up over the years, and the kid can't be bothered, because I forget why,  I think he's got, you know, a lunch appointment, or he's just distracted, right?  So then Jack finally leaves the office, and he sees the dumpster with his old files.  His whole body of work, everything he lived and worked for, for years and years and years  amounted to garbage, and he is being replaced, and, you know, they got their ways, and they  don't even need his files.  Like, I'm sure he assumed if they came upon a problem, they could look in his files and 
[01:00:00]  reference what he did and stuff, and it just meant nothing.  It meant nothing.  It was, I laughed so hard at that movie.  Dude, when he comes home, and the vacuum sound is going.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And his wife is laying.  Can I explain why that movie's really funny?  Funny?  Yeah, because they're pulling at your heartstrings, okay?  Yeah, I'm really trying.  I got that early on, that this is going to be a brutal movie about everything going wrong  with an older guy with his life, right? 
[01:00:30]  But they pushed it to the limit that I couldn't be sad anymore.  I just started laughing, because you just knew what was coming.  You're like, oh, it's going to get worse than this.  Then he comes home, and the vacuum cleaner's running, and his wife's dead.  Wife's dead on the floor with her shoe off.  She's laying there on her stomach.  The vacuum she was using is still running, so it's just, you hear the vacuum going.  And her feet are all askew, and one shoe is hanging off.  Yeah.  Right where she just dropped dead.  That's exactly the way you'd find somebody dead.  I love that scene with the vacuum going. 
[01:01:00]  Just awful.  So I was with the movie, and what they were trying to bring across.  But then it got so ridiculous, I took it the other way.  I'm like, now this is really funny.  When he takes the mobile home across the country to see his daughter, who could care less about him.  I know, yeah.  And all of a sudden, he's pulling up to his childhood home.  I already knew that that was just going to be something else.  He had a little smile on his face.  He was so excited to go back to his childhood home that was there 60 years ago. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  And I already knew that it was just going to be brutal.  I started laughing.  I actually got yelled at.  There was a bunch of ladies watching the film behind me, and they started yelling at me like,  that's not funny.  And it turned out to be a, what, a tire store?  It's a tire store.  His old childhood home.  His old house.  Where he has all these memories.  And it wasn't even a hint that a house had been there.  It's like a tire store and a big parking lot around it.  Wasn't he in the middle of the tire store going, this is about where my bedroom was or something like that?  He goes, I grew up here.  Right.  And the guy goes, yeah, whatever, do you want some radio? 
[01:02:00]  And he's like, yep.  And he's like, yeah, no one cared about him at all.  You know, that's one of those movies.  It wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but they took it so far that I couldn't help but laugh.  Couldn't help but laugh.  And then that horrific scene that got all the publicity was, what's her face?  Kathy Bates being naked.  Kathy Bates getting into the hot tub.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a world of hurt.  Yeah, that was a little rough.  I think she's showing up tomorrow for Cherry Darts.  I think Steve Bookson.  Did you like that movie, though? 
[01:02:30]  No.  It was one of those movies that was just kind of on, and I was looking over my shoulder as I was playing EverQuest 2 and kind of paying attention to it.  It just ends kind of.  Yeah, I go to movies like Tuesday afternoons with the old ladies.  That's what they do, I guess, on Tuesdays.  And I was leaving the movie theater just going, man, that was a great comedy.  I swear to God.  It was a very depressing movie.  It was depressing.  Well, I'll explain it.  So then walking out, and the old ladies are just pissed off.  Like, I thought that was supposed to be a comedy. 
[01:03:00]  And I'm saying to myself, it was for me.  They thought it was supposed to be a comedy?  Yeah, because I guess the coming attractions for that movie, they showed all the kind of funny moments.  Oh, ha ha.  No, there were funny moments in the movie, and they strung those together.  And we were talking about this yesterday.  Yeah, they can make it look like something.  They market movies in a weird way.  And so they market that movie like it was kind of a dark comedy.  Yeah.  And it certainly wasn't.  Well, I got it confused.  Funny you say that.  I got the movie confused with that other movie that came out with Jack Nicholson. 
[01:03:30]  Dude, I've been making that mistake my whole life.  And every time I'm thinking of the actor or the golfer, I have to, like, consciously think of his name.  What was the comedy he was just in?  Don't tell me that awful one with him and the girl.  That wasn't that bad.  It really wasn't that bad.  They scream at each other.  They both see each other naked.  With Kay Corleone.  Not as good as it gets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With Diane Keaton.  Diane Keaton.  That wasn't that bad.  I didn't see it. 
[01:04:00]  But I thought, now, last night, I thought that's what was on.  I thought that was the movie.  Oh, okay.  So as I'm watching it, I'm waiting for the funny.  And, you know, there he is retiring.  And his life is in the garbage.  And his wife is dead on the floor.  I'm like, wait.  Is this the movie with Diane Keaton?  What's the name of that movie?  As Good As It Gets?  No, no, no.  That's the Oscar winner.  Something's Gotta Give.  Thank you.  Something's Gotta Give.  Yeah, Something's Gotta Give.  Like that would happen in real life.  He'd blow off the hot piece of ass for the old hag.  I mean, no offense to the older ladies out there. 
[01:04:30]  That ain't happening ever.  It ain't gonna happen.  So.  Hi, Steve.  What were we talking about?  Oh, so Tom Brokaw.  Oh, yes.  His little send-off on the Today Show.  And he got a little choked up.  And it was kind of hard to watch.  You got a little clip?  Yeah, no.  I was being handed a note.  Yeah, so he was on the Today Show with everybody around him.  Giving him a send-off.  Before his last broadcast, by the way.  We'll leave you now with Tom Brokaw's goodbye.  He stopped by the Today Show this morning. 
[01:05:00]  And Katie, Matt, and the gang toasted Tom.  Very special.  It's from a song, but nobody does it better and no one ever has Tom.  Well, it's very sweet.  It's been a great, great privilege.  Thank you.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Congratulations and all of that.  That's just awful.  Who wants to see that?  He really cried.  Yeah, I thought he just, like, stopped himself.  Oh, no. 
[01:05:30]  He couldn't even talk.  He was so choked up.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Drink up, everybody.  I'm fucking cocked.  I get a little emotional.  I love champagne.  The bubbles sickle my nose.  Guys, can I have one more week, please?  I don't want to go. 
[01:06:00]  It's like Jack Nicholson.  I mean, Nicholas.  I mean, in that movie.  It's like seeing your dad cry.  You don't want to see your dad cry ever.  You never want to see that.  Oh, you never want to see that.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly.  So then.  No.  So then we got his final words on.  Yes, here it is. 
[01:06:30]  His NBC Nightly News.  This is last.  This was his send-off.  Yes.  Last night.  Well, the time is here.  We've been through a lot together through dark days and nights and seasons of hope and joy.  Whatever the story, I had only one objective, to get it right.  When I failed, it was personally painful, and there was no greater urgency than course correction.  On those occasions, I was grateful for your forbearance and always mindful that your patience and attention didn't come with a lifetime warranty. 
[01:07:00]  I was not alone here, of course.  I am simply the most conspicuous part of a large, thoroughly dedicated and professional staff that extends from just beyond these cameras, across the country and around the world, in too many instances and places of grave danger and personal hardship, and they're a family to me.  What have I learned here?  More than we have time to recount this evening, but the enduring lessons through the decades are these.  It's not the questions that get us in trouble. 
[01:07:30]  It's the answers.  And just as important, no one person has all the answers.  Just ask a member of the generation that I came to know well, the men and women who came of age in the Great Depression, who had great personal sacrifice, saved the world in World War II,  and returned home to dedicate their lives to improving the nation they had already served so nobly.  They weren't perfect, no generation is, but this one left a large and vital legacy of common effort to find common ground here and abroad in which to solve our most vexing problems. 
[01:08:00]  They did not give up their personal beliefs and greatest passions, but they never stopped learning from each other, and most of all, they did not give up on the idea that we're all in this together.  We still are.  And it is in that spirit that I say thanks for all that I have learned from you.  That's been my richest reward.  That's Nightly News for this Wednesday night.  I'm Tom Brokaw.  You'll see Brian Williams here tomorrow night, and I'll see you along the way.  So thanks for the night. 
[01:08:30]  I'm Tom, thanks.  That was great.  No, I really wanted to.  Come on, Tom.  You've got to get it.  No.  Take his mic off.  I'm not giving up my...  Take his mic off.  Get him out of the seat.  We've got to get him out of here.  Come on.  Turn the music off.  I'm just saying.  Come on, Brian Williams is waiting in the way.  You've got to go, Tom.  I don't want to go.  Go get your mobile off.  Bye.  Bye.  I don't want to retire anymore.  I don't want to retire anymore.  Please, can I say just a little? 
[01:09:00]  I want to stay.  I want to stay.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Take a motor home and see my daughter?  Have my Hummels fall off the roof as I drive away with the candles sliding?  Find my wife, Jed, with a vacuum cleaner going in her shoe slightly askew?  What a horrible day that will be.  I just want to stay here on NBC Nightly and lose. 
[01:09:30]  Come on.  Who wants me to stay?  Raise your hand.  Come on.  Put your hands up, guys.  Look at the TV.  They already got the new commercials for Brian Williams.  You're yesterday's news.  Yesterday, you're drinking champagne.  Today, they got the new commercials on TV.  Ain't life a bitch.  I walked out back yesterday, and I saw my segment I did on the Berlin Wall coming down in the dumpster.  It was horrible.  All my work, all the work I put into it, my touching tribute to the brave souls that lost their lives on the Challenger. 
[01:10:00]  It was sitting there on banana peels and garbage juice.  I pulled Brian Williams aside and told him, there's no greater thing than to be a communicator to the...  And he was like, yeah, whatever.  Whatever, Tom.  My seat now.  I was there getting my mic turned off by opening. 
[01:10:30]  No, I didn't do that one.  But it is time for you to go, so maybe that made sense there.  Please, just a little bit longer.  Oh, please stay, Tom Brokaw, just a little bit longer.  We want to do the news just a little bit more.  And if Brian Williams can go fuck himself, then I'll stay a little longer. 
[01:11:00]  No?  No, it's over, Tom.  I'm sorry.  We already had the commercials running for Brian Williams.  You're done.  Wear the old fishing hat.  Talk about balloons by the lake.  What am I supposed to do?  I was in the woods and I got lost.  I was so scared.  I was so scared.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  That's for you to figure out.  Walk around.  Maybe I could get the Tom Brokaw Little Rascal Scooter.  That'll be dignified. 
[01:11:30]  After being the great newscaster for so many years, there I'll be.  Oh, let me turn the lights on.  This is a great fucking life I have now.  Listening to the old bags screaming all the time.  There I was on top of the Berlin Wall as it came down.  And now I'm hearing, Tom, time to take out the garbage.  It's your turn.  She has no clue what I went through. 
[01:12:00]  There I was.  The end of an era of the communists in Russia.  Yeah, you were there when they took down the Berlin Wall.  Came down.  Remember the shot of me getting the news as this?  Big heavy hammers were coming down on the Berlin Wall.  Remember that?  Yeah, you had a lot of youth back then.  Now I get, put the goddamn seat down, Tom.  I like the toilet paper coming out under the roll, not over the top. 
[01:12:30]  Like it makes a fucking difference.  What?  Like it makes a fucking difference.  Sometimes I have trouble catching my breath.  I don't know why.  Like it makes a...  Tom, you have no place else to go.  I have no place else to go.  I have no place else.  I got nothing.  Don't you do that.  Don't you do... 
[01:13:00]  I can remind you of your lines, Tom.  Now that you're older.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  Good.  What do I have?  What do I have?  I got nothing else.  You have nothing else, Tom. 
[01:13:30]  Except a gerbil and his asshole.  Allegedly.  That old gag.  That old gag.  It's done.  I'm...  You're finally done there, Tom.  I'm done.  I'm going to have to take some time and sit.  I agree to do other stories for NBC, though, and I'm sure they'll really pay a lot of attention  to that and give it a lot of time.  Of course they will.  I want to do my documentary on the Whippoorwill.  I'm sure they'll just promote the shit out of that one.  I hope you're happy to get more promotion on XM than I will get on NBC News. 
[01:14:00]  Tom, you sound a little woozy today.  Were you celebrating last night?  Sharing some campaign with Katie Curry.  Yeah.  Sounds like you overindulged last night after the last broadcast.  Actually, I was hanging out at a downtown Manhattan bar with your own Ben's Parks.  Oh, that's why Ben's not here.  Yes, we were tying one on.  I had a little bit of bad...  Sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  I had a little bit of bad... 
[01:14:30]  You know, Tom, there's one thing I want to ask you.  You know, you don't have to answer to anyone anymore, and you seem a little woozy.  This is true.  How do you really feel, just in general?  Well, I might as well put a bullet in my head.  I'd rather be on NBC Nightly News, but I was pushed out.  I actually didn't retire.  At least I don't have to leave in disgrace.  Well, how do you feel about your colleagues?  How do you feel about Katie Couric?  Katie Couric?  Yeah.  Her best segment was when they were snaking a tube up her ass live on television. 
[01:15:00]  For her...  Her asshole check-up.  It was lovely.  They really showed her best side.  You thought that was pretty ridiculous, right?  Yeah, that was kind of rigid.  I would never do that.  What about Matt Lauer?  You don't have to hold back anymore.  Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  Matt Lauer.  Lauer.  Lauer.  Two words.  Faggot. 
[01:15:30]  That's what I think about that.  Yeah, you can say that now.  I liked the colored guy when he was a little more rotund.  Yeah?  Yeah, what the hell's his name?  Al Roker?  Al Roker.  Al Roker.  You like the fat version of Al Roker?  I like the fat, jolly Al Roker.  The skinnier he gets, the more threatening he gets to me.  I don't know why that is.  I like the hey, hey, hey version.  A little better.  Like I would walk up to him and go, hey, hey, hey. 
[01:16:00]  And he'd go, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.  All right, well, I want to wish you luck there, Tom.  Thank you.  Like I'm really talking to Tom.  Here I am.  Hold on.  Now signing off.  Yeah, for the last time.  For the last time.  Oh, please.  You know, I'll be back on this program.  Half the impressions died.  Do you think I'm going to let this one go?  No.  Yeah, exactly.  Not for a second.  All right, Tom.  Do a whole retrospective and listen to me say words like Achilles Loro. 
[01:16:30]  Achilles Loro.  A what?  Well, they threw poor Leon King off the nephew and killed him off.  The terrorist Abu Abba.  Throwing a kid off on the deck of the Yucca.  JFK Jr., remember my report when he went down?  Oh, yeah.  And they took the Navy ship's grasp.  Right.  And tried to find his body and that of his nagging wife that killed him.  Mm-hmm.  If the bitch only would have gotten off the cell phone and kept her yap shut, perhaps he would have landed. 
[01:17:00]  Don't mind me.  I'm just watching television.  Um, Tom?  Yes.  Oh, I was a little woozy again.  It's time.  I'm nodding off.  I've been up late.  It's time for your final words.  You know what they have to be.  Is it NBC Nightly News?  No.  Is this?  It's the last words.  Is this courage?  It's the last words Anthony and I and Jim Norton said.  Is it, what's the frequency, Kenneth? 
[01:17:30]  When we got canceled.  I want to laugh.  Beat the shit out of that idiot.  At WNEW.  You do know what you have to say.  Yes, I do.  Tom Brokaw.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  I wish we had the Hulk walking away music as you said that.  That would be nice, but.  We're here at St. Pat's and we're doing the balloon knot.  No?  No.  Can't use that line.  What the hell is that?  I know it's here somewhere.  Press a button. 
[01:18:00]  Pull a chain.  How comes a chocolate chuchu shirt?  There it is, Tom.  There it is.  Your mom's box.  It's time to go, Tom.  I say these words.  Your mom's box.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wait, now that was your final words.  It has to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Okay, goodbye. 
[01:18:30]  All right, bye.  Your mom's box.  No, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Say goodbye, then your mom's box.  Your mom's box, goodbye.  No, the other way.  Who's on first?  Your final words have to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  That's NBC Nightly News.  Make your ass.  All right.  Turn in tomorrow when some young fuck will be in my seat.  That's right.  Your mom's box.  All right.  Bye, Tom.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you.  Your mom's box.  All right, bye. 
[01:19:00]  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, God.  Psycho Mark.  Used to work for the show.  Yep.  He got fired during one of our Sex for Sam things.  Right. 
[01:19:30]  Needless to say, he's not working for the show anymore.  I don't know what he's up to.  We really need to get him back on the show.  Last I heard, he was working at Fox News.  But now I hear no.  I hear that he's been fired from a few jobs now.  Since then?  I think he lost his radio gig, too.  I'm not positive.  Well, needless to say, he's unemployed.  Needless to say.  What was the radio gig that he had?  I honestly didn't know.  Alan Combs, he was helping out?  Needless to say.  Needless to say?  That's what he says like 800 times during the interview. 
[01:20:00]  Needless to say?  Come on.  Needless to say.  Needless to say.  Then don't say it.  This was one of the funniest things that happened to us after we got fired.  Gave us a few chuckles in our chuckle-less life back then.  Watching Psycho Mark be an expert on the Opie and Anthony situation.  Yeah.  In a suit that they lent him.  I didn't have many laughs when we were on hiatus, whatever you want to call it.  But I would pop up this video from time to time and just laugh like an idiot.  I really would.  Ben would call me.  I'd be in the middle of America somewhere. 
[01:20:30]  He goes, dude, have you watched the video lately?  I'm like, no.  Watch a moron handle a news interview.  But this was the day we finally got to play the interview on the show and comment, and  it's pretty funny.  So check it out.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  We have to go backwards a little bit, but I forgot that we've never talked about this  on the show.  Oh, the Psycho Mark.  In our time off, though, we've been quoting lines from this thing over and over again to  each other.  Ben thinks it's the funniest thing ever.  Oh, of course.  That was ever on TV. 
[01:21:00]  And if you know Psycho Mark, unfortunately for the new listeners, they don't know who  Psycho Mark is yet.  Where is Psycho Mark these days?  He's being very responsible as he works for Fox.  Is he still at Fox?  Yes.  What did he do there?  Where's Ben?  Ben would know.  See, now here we've got another guy.  Doesn't mind you, too.  That's the problem you get when you play music on your radio show.  You've got to get Ben.  Ben.  We could play like Hank Williams Jr., and there'd be a ton of people going, all right, now the  boys are talking, and then the other people will turn us off.  So, you know, we understand that game when we go to music here and there. 
[01:21:30]  Here comes Ben.  He was just by the water machine.  Opie getting a little drink.  There he is.  Trying to water down his hair.  Keep it calm today.  Ben.  Yes.  We're going to play the Psycho Mark game.  That's hilarious.  This is hilarious.  What is Psycho Mark doing these days?  He's producing Alan Combs' show.  Oh, is that what he does?  Oh, that's right.  He's producing a radio show, and he also still works cameraman at Fox.  No?  Fox and Friends are one of those shows.  But this is hilarious, because he's naming cities you guys weren't even on.  And I remember when this happened, Opie called me, and he's like, what the fuck is he doing? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, he's way out of, he's saying how he knows the leader of the Catholic League, how  he's a friend of his.  This was the first guy.  He just lost his mind.  Yeah.  This was the first guy that was even remotely involved with the show that was talking.  This was, when did this air?  This was the day after.  This was the day after we got fired.  Or canceled, whatever, yeah.  Yeah, canceled, fired, whatever.  It was a Friday.  It was a Friday morning.  Yeah.  Because of the thing happening on a Thursday.  So he was like the inside guy.  Well, because they were trying to get, you know, it was such a big thing, the Sex and St. 
[01:22:30]  Pat's, that they were trying to get anyone on their air.  Yeah.  They wanted us, obviously.  They camped outside our residence for, I don't know, off and on for a couple weeks.  They wanted anybody involved with the show.  Anyone.  Steve, Rick, anybody.  Ben.  Yeah, anyone that was even close.  Our agent.  No one was talking.  People that worked for Viacom.  No one was talking.  No one was talking except Psycho Mark gave the exclusive interview to Fox and Friends.  And they even goofed on him a little bit at the beginning because he's wearing a suit  and he never wears a suit.  He's like, they're goofing on the fact that he's clean and he's got to give the suit back 
[01:23:00]  to the guy he borrowed it from.  Right.  I guess they pick him up.  He was a regular employee.  He would help us out, but he also worked for Fox and Friends.  So he was like just a regular scumbag over at Fox and Friends.  But he had the exclusive on the biggest story of the day.  So they treated him like a superstar.  They made sure he had a suit.  I think they even got him a limo that day to bring him to work.  Brushed his hair.  Brushed his hair and sat him down for the exclusive interview.  The inside scoop on Opie and Anthony.  Wonderful. 
[01:23:30]  This thing has made us laugh for the last two years.  I don't know if you'll find it as funny as we do, but we'll stop it.  You got to also remember, especially the new listeners, this guy is out of his freaking  mind.  Oh yeah.  That's why he's called Psycho Mark.  But he was using his broadcast voice all of a sudden.  Yeah.  Because this was a very serious day.  You ain't going from talking like this.  Let me tell you how fucked up we were last night.  Holy shit.  He'll talk about the collards in Boston with this really bad voice.  Yeah, the collards, they love keeping them in their own fucking area up there in Boston. 
[01:24:00]  And then he's like, hey, how are you doing, guys?  Right.  So I use the radio voice now.  Here's the audio.  We'll stop it.  Unfortunately for a couple of guys who are making millions of dollars a year, Opie and  Anthony in New York City, they were fired yesterday after a couple was caught having  sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And it was all being broadcast on their radio show.  Joining us now with some exclusive details is a member of that cast, Mark Walsh, better  known to Open Anthony, on those Open Anthony listeners as Psycho Mark. 
[01:24:30]  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Hi, guys.  Good to have me on.  How are you?  Thanks for having me on.  Like he's a general talking about the war.  Right.  Thanks for having me on.  And like Jim Cook.  And right after this interview, he went right behind the camera again and filmed Fox and  Fred.  Yeah.  Thanks for having me on.  Wasn't he miking people back then?  Oh, that's what he was.  That's what his job was.  He would put the little microphones on to you.  Thanks for having me on.  Before the interview.  On those Open Anthony listeners as Psycho Mark.  Hi, guys.  How are you? 
[01:25:00]  Good.  Thanks for having me on.  Mark, it's a thrill to see you again, especially Clint.  Thrill to see you again.  Thrill to see you again.  They see him every day as he's miking the guest.  He works with you.  He works with you.  You're like me going, hey, Jimmy.  Thrilled to see you again.  Right.  Like, oh, he doesn't stop by very often, but good thing he's here today.  All kidding aside, and thanks for having me on.  Oh, no problem.  You're making it sound like he's their expert for things in the media.  Yeah.  You know, he comes from time to time.  Good to see you again.  Like you said, the war correspondent.  Yeah.  Especially clean. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, exactly.  With a suit and everything.  I know.  I didn't know you were.  I feel like a pundit, you know.  Give it back to John Scott at the end of the show.  That's part of the deal.  Fair deal.  But, Mark, let's talk seriously.  Fred was the one, our producer here, to inform you about what happened.  He talked to Obi and Anthony.  He did not.  He did not talk to us.  I'm actually going to say, oh, God.  Mark did not talk to me.  No.  Mark didn't talk to Anthony.  Uh-uh.  Anthony and I pretty much shut off our cell phones and went into hiding.  Yeah.  My own mom and dad didn't talk to me.  No one talked.  No one talked to us.  And Psycho Mark was not. 
[01:26:00]  We were pretty damn depressed about losing our careers.  No one was talking to us.  Psycho Mark was not spoken to.  I didn't.  Did you hear the first line?  It's so funny.  What happened?  You've talked to Obi and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting...  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, it was a bad thing.  Psycho Mark.  Wow.  Still new information there.  It was a bad thing.  This is a guy that held up the C word on live TV. 
[01:26:30]  But all of a sudden, he's going to throw us out to dry there.  Well, it was a bad thing.  Whenever you use the term needless to say twice in a row, you have nothing to say.  Needless to say, I have nothing to say, nothing to say.  Oh, we've never said this.  He was the guy that held up the C-U-N-T sign on live TV.  Yeah, that was him, wasn't it?  Yes, it was.  Yeah, he's also the guy that jumped on the front of the voyeur bus and hung on to the 
[01:27:00]  windshield wipers as it was on the street, pounding, let me in, let me in.  And bragging that he hit an ounce of pot somewhere on the bus, so they had to take the bus apart.  Like ants take apart a grasshopper.  That's what they did to the voyeur bus, because Psycho was bragging that he hit an ounce on it.  Guys, they're arresting us right now.  I hit my pot in one of the seats.  They'll never fucking find it.  Oh, I got my smooth guy, boy.  The cops are coming. 
[01:27:30]  This is the same guy.  I mean, we love the guy, trust me.  Oh, don't get us wrong.  We love the guy.  This guy's a pisser.  He does great radio for us, but this thing is unbelievable.  She had to inform you about what happened.  You've talked to Obi and Anthony since.  What's their feeling about getting canned?  Well, it was a huge thing, needless to say.  I mean, needless to say, the entire stunt was a bad thing.  What happened was entirely wrong, and the boys are very upset that it even happened.  The boys are very upset.  The boys. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  The boys.  It's like a father talking about his kids.  The boys are very upset with what happened.  I won't do it again.  Needless to say, I mean, it was needless to say a bad thing.  The entire stunt was entirely wrong.  It's like, geez, he's got four words he's saying.  He's beyond nervous, though.  This is his big moment in the spotlight.  What I'm saying is needless.  Yeah, the boys are really, they knew they had to get the papers.  Get the papers.  Needless to say, needless to say.  What I'm saying is needless to say.  Then we're off to the fire.  The boys are very upset.  I know.  I was listening to that. 
[01:28:30]  It's hilarious.  Oh, the boys.  It happened.  What was at stake here was a trip to the Sam Adams plant up in Massachusetts, and whoever  got the most points would get the free trip, right?  Exactly.  And the way you get points is you go around town, and the couples would engage in lewd acts  in different places.  All right, listen to me.  And I just remembered something.  Didn't he go with you that day?  What's that?  Yeah.  He followed you that day with your couple.  Yeah.  So he was actually in there.  So far, he's got the facts straight, though. 
[01:29:00]  Except the fact that he talked to you.  The boys were upset.  Ah, right.  And the reason, by the way, needless to say, needless to say, that he's working at Fox  anyway is because he got fired from his job at WNEW.  And why did he get fired?  For the second annual Sex for Sam contest, when he took his couple into our boss's office  and made them have anal sex on the couch of our general manager, while our program director  was looking through the glass door going, no, don't do that. 
[01:29:30]  And Psycho Mark spun his head around, looked at our program director, and said to his couple,  guys, go for it.  Yeah, live on the air.  What was the program director doing besides instructing the girl how to relax before she  took a cock in her ass?  You just won't let that go, that you didn't get your raise before you got fired.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Anyway, so this is who they have on Fox and Friends. 
[01:30:00]  And he is our pal, but I think it's just hilarious.  In different places.  So they'd have sex in different places.  Exactly.  For points.  And then someone picked the St. Patrick's Cathedral, and even with a 40-second delay,  Well, what happened before the show was, and it was explained to everybody that took part  in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That is a flat-out lie.  That's a lie, too.  We didn't even bring up the word St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[01:30:30]  Church was on the list.  Yeah.  We kind of told the people, you know, did we even tell them to steer clear of the churches?  I don't think we did.  No, not really.  I think it was on the list, but we assumed.  We were going to control it from where we sat.  Yeah.  We did a great job, didn't we?  We weren't going to take any calls from, like, a church.  Or if we did, we were going to, like, play it in a way that we would have probably saved  our asses.  Yeah.  But when we plunked the phone line down and Paul Mercurio just said, we're here at St.  Pat's, and they're doing the balloon knot, it was kind of too late. 
[01:31:00]  No turning back.  Could have punched the dump button, though.  All right.  Here's a shit of what.  Here's more Psycho Mark.  Two of my favorite things are still coming up.  Somebody that took part in the show, do not go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This was told to all the participants before we even went on air that day, okay?  Can I just jump in real quick?  I mean, any church, there was, like, 25 points that you could get for going into a church.  Wouldn't you just think any church would blow people's mind?  Most of the stuff that happens is, it's radio.  It's on air. 
[01:31:30]  It's a description.  It's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So to speak.  It's an expert on radio.  Radio, it's theater of the mind, so to speak.  So you have a theater and a mind, neither of which I'm in possession of at this moment.  That makes it funny.  If you know Psycho Mark, like, we know.  What a tool.  I love it.  I love it.  How did you guys get Rod Serling to do an interview on your behalf?  Pitiful portrait.  Exactly.  Of a dumped duo. 
[01:32:00]  Exactly.  Submitted for your approval, Opie and Anthony.  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying?  Those acts aren't necessarily happening, but they are as described on the air.  Described as on the air.  Described as on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Bling, bling, bling.  He's doing gymnastics with the English language. 
[01:32:30]  What is he trying to say here?  So to speak.  In other words, those acts necessarily aren't really happening, but they are described as on the air.  Now, wait a minute.  Are you saying they didn't really have sex?  Because the usher says the people were partially naked.  I'm not going to get into the...  If they wanted to do a theater to the mind, they would have been in a car outside and said,  We're inside the church.  Okay.  Well, what happened was there's a fail-safe system on a show.  There's a 40-second delay that they use. 
[01:33:00]  In other words, they have up to 10 times to dump out of the show within 40 seconds.  So if something gets aired that's inappropriate, there's an opportunity to take it off the show.  So why didn't they dump it?  Well, that's what happened.  There's a whole chain of command, a system that works with the program director and the general manager.  Both suspended.  Well, they both have boxes in their office and are able to dump out of the show at any time.  Now, they should have been on The Post that afternoon monitoring the show.  Now, these guys, this Opie and Anthony, you know, you're not talking about...  You don't go to them for news, weather, and sports.  This is not Paul Harvey.  Exactly.  You don't tune in to Fox for, you know, dirty jokes. 
[01:33:30]  Ah, here, I don't have to say big jokes.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  You've got to stay on top of them.  You've got to stay on top of them.  Mark, we spent half our time staying on top of you, you idiot.  Oh, God.  How he is portraying himself in this is really funny.  He's coming off like he's the responsible guy.  The voice of reason.  Yeah.  A gentleman.  The voice of reason.  I'm sitting here in my suit, criticizing. 
[01:34:00]  Man.  Exactly.  You don't tune in to Fox for, you know, dirty jokes.  Right.  They're shock jocks.  Right.  So you've got to stay on top of them all the time.  So yesterday they got fired.  The general manager and the program director have been suspended.  Are they going to get canned, too?  Most likely.  And what happened is the formats will probably change at the station.  You'll probably see a switch probably to light music.  You're kidding me.  So they're going to lose all that talk and that dramatic switch that no carmazon made happen.  Well, they're on several markets as well.  They're number one in Philly.  They're number one in Buffalo. 
[01:34:30]  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Detroit.  That's the only thing he's got wrong so far, really.  His facts are right.  They did go.  What a good call.  Yeah, well, he kind of knew that.  They were going to light FM.  I mean, after the thing that blinked didn't work, they went to light FM.  He's right.  And we're on in Detroit.  They're number one in Buffalo.  They're number one in Cleveland.  Where do they?  Detroit.  Let me think of another city.  Detroit.  Did they move to another station to do their show from there?  Because they were fired from Boston.  Exactly. 
[01:35:00]  They were also fired from...  For doing something.  But you know what?  I spoke to them last night.  Is that correct, Mark?  Yes, for the mayor's death.  Yeah, they may believe the mayor died.  But this is Opie and Anthony.  I mean, these guys, they said the mayor was dead on April Fool's Day.  I mean, come on.  Who's going to really believe?  Ultimately, this just...  How many people know it's April first?  Come on!  Ultimately, though, this shows you how far afield shock jocks have gotten.  I mean, it used to be just Howard Stern just talking quasi-dirty,  but now we're having sex in a church. 
[01:35:30]  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says,  you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  He says, when does the Catholic League have 350 members?  Yeah.  I think he's off?  A little bit.  I didn't hear that, actually.  Yeah.  The Catholic League, with 350 members, now says, you know what?  Since they got canned, we're not going to push for WNEW to lose their license.  So they're stepping away from it.  Which is a fair shot.  And they had every right to be mad. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, Bill Donahue is a good guy.  And he had every right to be upset.  He's not a good guy!  What an ass.  He's never talked to Bill Donahue.  Yeah, he did.  He had him on the Fox show once, and he put a microphone on him.  That's what Mark did.  He told me.  He goes, I had Bill Donahue sitting in the chair, and I clipped a little clip-on microphone  on him, and turned on the little battery pack, and that was it.  But he's not a good guy.  He's an arrogant demagogue and a douche.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  He wants to push his morality on everybody.  Well, you know, I sat down and spoke with him.  And he's a good guy.  Could you say check one, two?  Thank you.  That's the extent of our conversation.  The highest asshole he is.  Bill Donahue is a good guy, and he had every right to be upset.  Real quickly, did they ever talk about Opie and Anthony?  Did they ever sit there and say, well, maybe this is going over the line?  Or was it just like, hey, let's push the envelope?  It all goes over the line.  It happens so fast.  In other words, it made the air, and it's like, you know, you stepped in crap. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, God.  You know, what do you do?  You're in it.  And it was too late.  Can we leave that out?  It was already there.  Mark, my last question, are they going to sue to get their jobs back?  Is this what they do?  They might have a lawyer.  Chances are they'll probably, they're in negotiations right now with another company.  And we'll probably see them back on the air shortly.  So they'll take millions of dollars from CBS for leaving and go get another job someplace else.  Most likely that's exactly what's going to happen.  All right, Mark Walsh, thanks very much for giving us the exclusive details on the morning show.  Oh, Robin.  All right, thanks very much. 
[01:37:30]  He's got a different house impression.  He's such an ass.  That was the best part.  He goes, I know for a fact they're negotiating with another company.  I'm sitting home going, really?  Really?  We're negotiating, huh?  Why don't you tell us who that is?  It only took two years and three months to get back on the radio, Mark.  Yeah, that's all.  We're negotiating a day after being canceled.  That's most likely what'll happen in the Twilight Zone.  Really?  Bob Eatman is currently on the right wing of an aircraft.  My brother's on the wing. 
[01:38:00]  You've got to open the door.  We just find that very funny because we know the guy.  He was definitely trying to help us out, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  No, Mark is trying to help himself out.  Mark loves attention.  And when they said, hey, why don't you come on and talk about ONA?  You'd think he was going to say, well, I really don't have that much information.  Or get me the suit and turn on the camera.  Get me the suit, get me the ride, and I'm in. 
[01:38:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  Needless to say, you know, needless to say.  The entire thing was entirely exactly.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Exactly.  My entire interview was needless to say.  Entirely.  Exactly.  Let me say exactly entirely.  Bill Donoghue's a good guy.  You know, Hitler was really criticized. 
[01:39:00]  No one really looks at all the good he did.  Mussolini was a great oil painter.  That's our old pal.  We'll get him back on the air eventually.  You know, he kept the trains on time.  Exactly.  You'd look at your watch and say, the train is supposed to come in at nine.  Is it on time?  Exactly.  Exactly on time.  Oh, really?  Do I need a schedule?  Or needless to say, needless to have a schedule. 
[01:39:30]  There's a platform full of frightened people, but needless to say, they'll all be hustled into the cars and moved along.  Ah, he's too much.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's going to be hot on those cars.  Exactly.  Needless to say, they should be hosed down.  Maybe give some chocolates to the people at the next station to hose them down.  They were indeed kept together when they had arrived at the family camps.  And before they got on, there was a discussion, don't go to Auschwitz. 
[01:40:00]  Don't go to Auschwitz.  Actually.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anyway, we're going to play a bit.  I don't want any part of this one, actually.  Why?  It's that whole Connor Peterson thing that you guys get into.  It's hysterical.  You guys just laugh like little girls when we bring up the Connor Peterson case.  It's hysterical.  And I don't know.  I remember this was the time I got very uncomfortable because I think YouTube basically went off on a tangent about really bad baby t-shirts.  T-shirts that they make for babies.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There was a website or something? 
[01:40:30]  T-ShirtHell.com.  I don't know.  You know what?  I have to listen to this bit again because I really don't remember this one.  So take a listen to this.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Do we have that story about the...  Which one now?  The baby's t-shirts.  Oh, I think so.  Somewhere in this pile.  Because I was laughing at the fact that they were outraged by the one that they used as an example.  Shocking off for baby t-shirts?  Baby t-shirts.  Now, these kind of risque, kind of shocking t-shirts are available for little infants, for babies now. 
[01:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they're kind of funny sayings.  With titles like Hot Babe, Mommy's Little Monster, Diva, Serial Killer.  10%?  Serial spelt like cereal.  Oh, cereal.  What you eat cereal.  Yeah.  10% soft spot, 90% bitch.  There you go.  Is that a shirt?  Yes, it is.  Well, according to me now, it is.  That's very funny.  I just chimed in with that and made it up.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  But, you know, I was reading their examples and there's an outrage because of these shirts. 
[01:41:30]  But the examples they give are nothing compared to some of them I've seen.  Well, here's one that they're really pissed off at.  A t-shirt that says, bitch, better have my bottle.  Oh, that must get them angry.  And Sir Craps-A-Lot.  Sir Craps-A-Lot.  They're among the hottest sellers.  You don't like Sir Craps-A-Lot?  No, I don't.  Just say Ben on it.  There's another baby t-shirt, Anthony. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  That says, my mom puts out.  Wow.  I like that.  Now, I've never seen these.  And then the mom is saying, but I'll bet my husband wishes it was true.  And the one that was tasteless, that one from California, there was only the one kid that  wore it and it just said, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.  You're so obsessed.  I don't really understand why, but you're so obsessed with that trial. 
[01:42:30]  Thank God that trial is just about over.  What trial?  Thank God it's just about over.  It's a little.  And we can finally move on.  Is that the little shirt?  It's a little shirt.  And you can wash it as many times as you want and it won't shrink because it's used to being  in the water.  Right.  And it's got a little arrow pointing one way and says, I'm with mommy who wouldn't shut  up. 
[01:43:00]  No?  Oh.  And another t-shirt, Anthony, that says, where's all the bitches at?  Where's all the bitches at?  Now, you're saying these shirts are tame compared to the other ones that you've seen out there?  One of my favorite sites is t-shirthell.com.  Okay.  You ever go there?  No.  Very funny t-shirts.  And they have a whole baby section.  And these are much better than the ones they give examples for.  Imagine you're a little toddler wearing a shirt that says, now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice. 
[01:43:30]  Now, that's kind of funny.  I tore mommy a new one.  Another one reads, Chinese delicacy.  Do they cook, child?  Did you get this one, Anthony?  Now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice.  Yes.  That's the one I just read.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, because someone was distracting me.  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  I have no idea.  No wonder you can't remember who made the mess.  What?  Well, you guys don't understand. 
[01:44:00]  During the radio show, I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones off, giving instructions,  receiving communiques.  This one's cool.  Yeah.  I tore mommy a new one.  All right.  I heard that one, you ass.  You're coming off as an insane person today.  I know.  Whose Rolaids are these?  Rolaids in my studio.  Peter, get the suntan lotion.  You know there are times during the show I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones off, 
[01:44:30]  and trying to find other stuff to enhance some of these bits that we do.  Right.  So I got caught.  I got caught napping on that one.  I'm sorry.  How about this one?  Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?  There you go.  You're a little toddler being, yeah, that's a real one.  You could buy it.  Did you say the one?  I pray you didn't.  They shake me?  No, I didn't say that.  Well, how funny is that as a shirt for you little kid?  That's a little crazy.  Kid walking around with a they shake me t-shirt. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  How about Daddy Drinks Because I Cry?  Did you do that one?  No, no, I didn't do that one.  I enjoy a good spanking.  Playground pimp.  Daddy's milk is saltier than mommy's.  That is not a t-shirt.  This one has a big pot leaf on the front, and it's a little t-shirt for your baby,  and it says potty head.  You know, a little play on pot head.  Potty head.  Did you read the one hung like a five-year-old? 
[01:45:30]  That's very funny.  Daddy's lil squirt, and it says L-I-L.  It's spelled lil.  What about this one that just says broken condom?  Hmm.  Those are funny shirts.  Oh, my IQ is higher than the president's.  The old, I can kick your baby's ass.  Yeah.  Those are a little more offensive than the examples they gave. 
[01:46:00]  And I hide my crack in my diaper.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, there's one from...  This is a weird one.  If you're in Florida in 1981, don't lose your head.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Then there's ones...  T-shirt hell is great.  They have t-shirts for everybody, not just for kids.  Mm-hmm.  There are some really, really offensive ones. 
[01:46:30]  Arrest black babies before they become criminals.  I mean, that's what it says.  I thought that was a boss post.  Who the...  Who the hell would get that?  This one, really offensive.  You know the I Love New York shirts?  Of course.  I Heart New York.  Yeah.  They have I, and then in place of the heart, they have an airplane.  The jet aircraft.  I Plane New York.  Oof.  Yeah.  People...  I mean, this is...  It's a t-shirt hell, and this is in the extreme section. 
[01:47:00]  But I would defy anyone to walk around wearing one of these.  Jesus did it for the chicks.  Abortions tickle.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  Great white kill...  It's a headline on a shirt.  Great white kills every single one of its hundred fans.  Wow.  I swear, I didn't know she was three.  That's my favorite one.  Oh. 
[01:47:30]  I didn't know she was...  If Asians were so smart, how'd they wind up with such tiny dicks?  Phew.  Help Stop Rape Consent.  Nice.  T-shirt hell.  There you go.  Oh, God.  I can't even read that one.  Why?  I found one I can't even read.  Really?  Norton, read it.  Where is it?  It's right here. 
[01:48:00]  Norton will take pleasure in reading it, I guarantee.  This one.  No, it's not.  He's laughing.  You're not going to read it?  Of course I'm going to read it.  I just did one.  Is it a ton?  Yeah.  Love him or hate him, Hitler killed a ton of Jews.  Holy yes.  Are you insane?  Who's walking around with that?  Yeah.  Byron.  Picture of Hitler.  Right.  Byron from yesterday.  Sure.  Hey, this is Laszlo from the Technophile and Grand Theft Auto. 
[01:48:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  With a wow sticker, some air guitar, and a roofie.  Shit suck.  XM202, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, Anthony, the food's here.  Oh, oh, oh.  So we're going to go get a plate of food, but in the meantime, it's Reverend Al.  When he got divorced, we got the news, and we did this thing that I forgot, but I'm sure  it's funnier.  We wouldn't have picked this to do right now.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We have a few stories in the paper we've got to get to. 
[01:49:00]  Reverend Al Anthony.  I love this one.  Reverend Al Sharpton and his wife, Kathy, enjoying themselves at a National Action Network dinner  in April of 2001.  Nice picture of Reverend Al.  And what looks like, I have to say it, a man.  Dude, what the hell is this?  Or a transvestite.  Reverend Al's been getting a lot of serious air time over the past few years.  And I didn't even know he was married.  He's been married 24 years to a woman that it's a guy. 
[01:49:30]  Well, if you just saw the picture of this girl and put it on the website, I would say  that half the people would guess that this is a man.  All kidding aside.  More than half.  All kidding aside.  Look at that.  Everyone would think it's a guy in drag.  Without Reverend Al on the picture, I know this is radio, but let me take a look.  Maybe we'll get the picture up online.  Look at that.  That is a man.  You would say that's a man, right?  I would bet a lot of money that's a man.  I absolutely say it's a man.  Big shoulders, the face is a man's face.  That is a man's face that Reverend Al's had to kiss every night for 24 years? 
[01:50:00]  Maybe it's just a bad picture.  That's been known to happen, you know?  Let me take a little quick peek.  All right.  I've got to get...  Yeah, big...  Oh.  Big head, big shoulders, and it's a man's face.  With like a weave.  Like a big jerry-curled weave on it.  It looks like Jackie from Risky Business.  This is the first time I feel sorry for Reverend Al.  I didn't know he was bedding that for 24 years. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, well, here's the story.  Reverend Al and wife to split after 24 years of marriage.  Al Sharpton and his wife Kathy are splitting up.  The couple announced the separation today.  Sharpton's representative blah, blah, blah, confirmed to the Daily News.  It's entirely amicable, the representative of Sharpton is saying.  Yes, of course it is.  It's always amicable.  It's always amicable in the news.  All right.  They are on the best of terms, but at this point, their daughters are grown, and they  want to pursue their separate interests. 
[01:51:00]  Are they dodging them?  Rumors the couple had grown distant have dogged Sharpton for months.  So this rumor's been out there a while, huh?  Yep.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah.  Kathy is getting back to entertainment as a consultant now, Sharpton told the news.  In July, she runs on her track, and I run on mine.  That's what we promised each other when our kids got older.  God damn, these headphones are going to drive me absolutely nuts.  I don't think it's the headphones.  Mine are clipping a little bit there, too.  They're now clipping?  Yeah, I think it's something with the... 
[01:51:30]  All right.  Sorry.  It makes me stop talking.  Ah, just talk.  All right.  Sharpton met his future wife, Kathy Lee Jordan, in 1979 when she was a backup singer for his  mentor, James Brown.  Looked like Michael Jordan.  So she used to sing backup for James Brown.  Really?  They married in Vegas.  The couple have two daughters, 18 and 17.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm just trying to get to the good stuff.  Last night, Sharpton was to attend rapper Sean P. Diddy Combs' 35th birthday party. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, did he show up?  With actress Robin Givens, ex-wife of boxer Mike Tyson.  Reverend Al was supposed to go with Robin Givens?  Is that what they're saying here?  Yeah, it looks like that, right?  Sharpton told the news.  I see a nice piece of Tang.  Sharpton told the news in July that he resented the suspicious minds.  Wait, he's hanging out with Robin Givens or are they just friends?  Who knows?  Reverend Al, now he's got a TV show.  He's been a presidential candidate.  He's on all kinds of shows now.  He hosted SNL and did a good job. 
[01:52:30]  The guy is now kind of a little power base going for himself.  He's probably getting nicer women that are coming up to him.  If he's hanging with Robin Givens, it's better than the guy he's with for 24 years.  That's a man.  I'm going to defend Reverend Al.  It might be just a bad picture.  The name of his TV show is called I Hate My Job.  I hate my job.  It's one of those black shows, so it should be called I Have a Job.  Sorry.  It was easy.  One minute I get blasted if I have all men around me, he said.  Then I get blasted if I have women.  What does that mean? 
[01:53:00]  He gets blasted for having all men around him because one of them is his wife.  That is a guy.  Yeah, well, let's bring Reverend Al in the studio.  I am outraged.  Here he comes, Reverend Al, everybody.  I am outraged.  His first appearance on the new Opie and Anthony show.  I am outraged.  Why are you outraged, Reverend Al?  Why?  You saw that picture?  Yeah.  I am outraged.  For 24 years, I've been banging Samuel L. Jackson.  You'd be outraged, too. 
[01:53:30]  Look at her.  Yeah, she looks...  Look at that picture.  I am outraged.  Yeah, your wife looks like him with the wig, sure.  My penis is filing a complaint against me.  But I had to be with that for 24 years.  Look at her.  Doesn't she look like Tina Turner?  Tina Turner.  I mean, after Ike hit her in the face with a phone book.  Yeah, there you go.  She looked just like her.  You confused me a little bit there, Reverend Al.  Look closely.  She looked like a girl you've seen in the movies, doesn't she? 
[01:54:00]  If you've seen the movie Gremlins, the one that dressed like a girl, look at her.  I am outraged.  Why I got to be with that?  I'm dumping my wife as fast as I can.  The grounds for divorce, she looked like a man.  I'm outraged.  That's horrible.  Reverend Alex, she'll be getting some good poody tang these days.  She ironed my shirts and folded my socks.  But after 24 years, I'll need some younger box. 
[01:54:30]  You got some rhymes about this.  I need it.  I'm a rhyming motherfucker.  It is very, very sad.  Very sad when a marriage splits.  But she looks like Dennis Rodman with a couple of tits, doesn't she?  I can't sleep with this woman no more.  Wait, she does look like Dennis Rodman.  Of course she does.  Now you got it, bro.  I am outraged.  Dennis Rodman in a wig and clown makeup.  Please, she look like a woman when you're standing behind her. 
[01:55:00]  But when she turns around, it's Bill Cosby with a vagina.  Behind her vagina?  No.  That's good.  That's creative.  I'll give that one to you.  You got to give me...  You got to...  I'm outraged.  After Pablo's appearance, I'd definitely give you that one.  Thank God I could get this shit out without being stepped on.  I am outraged.  I'm rich and I'm famous.  I got this show on TV.  I'm going to find me a woman that don't stand up to pee.  Did you see her? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I see her.  That's the joke.  She's a man.  We got it, bro.  You get it?  These are all jokes about her being a man.  She is a lovely woman.  A credit to our race.  Yeah.  But I got to take Viagra just to look at her face.  Now, that's ugly.  I am outraged.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  I like that one.  I am outraged.  You got to find me a hot woman.  Yeah.  Because I can't bed down with that no more.  She looked like the stuff that we rubbed on Tawana Brawley after we wrote the racial epithet 
[01:56:00]  on her chest.  Remember that?  What was it called?  Oh, yeah.  Shit.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'm outraged.  And as I leave, let me see, I'm dumping my wife because her ass got too fat.  Now, Reverend Al's got one question.  Where are the white women at?  I want to wear the black prize.  I need the blonde. 
[01:56:30]  I am outraged.  There he goes.  Reverend Al, everybody.  Outraged.  He is outraged.  What an angry man.  That was a pretty good first appearance for Reverend Al.  He seems to have done well.  Yes.  Reverend Al getting a divorce after 24 years in holy wedlock.  All right.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Queens.  Hey, Andrew.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, did anybody ask the question, what in the fuck is Al Sharpton getting married in  Vegas for?  The guy's a reverend.  He doesn't have his own fucking church. 
[01:57:00]  Obviously, I was gambling and I crapped out.  Oh, I'm punching out.  Groves Sheet families, nigga.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, why was he getting to, isn't he a reverend?  Couldn't he go to a church and get married?  He got married in Vegas?  That guy was the biggest fake.  I mean, he's not as much a fake anymore because he's kind of presenting himself as an entertainer.  Right.  More than anything else with the TV show and his appearances.  But he was a big fake when he's trying to be a reverend.  I'm sorry.  I'm really distracted.  What is that? 
[01:57:30]  It's our new Jägermeister machine that's arrived.  Oh, it came in.  Yeah.  And then they're coming with Jägermeister machine.  Oh, look at everyone applauding in the other booth.  The Jägermeister machine has arrived?  Yeah.  And Jäger's coming in with some of the Jägorettes on Tuesday and they're going to fill it up.  What's a Jägorettes?  The more gals.  Oh, they're the Jäger girls?  Yeah.  I love the booze girls.  More girls that aren't going to do anything.  But they're cool because you don't expect anything out of them and they're just kind of good to look at.  They wear their little skirts.  They dress them up all slutty because they want to sell the booze. 
[01:58:00]  So they put them in little green dresses and stuff.  Right.  Remember Bud Girls?  Of course.  And the Kahlua Girls?  And it's just great.  And also Earl has arrived.  Oh, an hour and a half late.  Great.  Mr. Excitement is here for our show.  Why is he late coming here?  What could he possibly have been doing?  Bring Earl in.  Absolutely nothing.  Here he comes.  Roll Earl the picture of Reverend Al.  That's nice.  Where's the daily news?  Where'd you put it open?  The daily snooze?  I might have threw her. 
[01:58:30]  I might have threw her away.  Yeah, here it is.  Okay.  Look at Reverend Al's wife.  What do you think, Earl?  And be honest, Earl.  What do you think, Earl?  Well, that's a dude.  Yeah.  That's a total dude.  It's a guy.  It looks like a guy who became a...  Oh, my God.  Someone said it looks like...  Well, someone.  Reverend Al himself, wink, wink, said that it looks like Dennis Rodman in a wig.  Yep.  With clown makeup on.  Maybe it's a bad picture.  Yeah, it's probably...  I hope it's a bad picture. 
[01:59:00]  But you know something?  If I didn't know he was married for 24 years, he was obviously hiding her.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  And ashamed of her.  He's hanging out with Robin Givens now.  All right, Earl.  You have nothing.  What?  What did I do now?  Earl.  Earl.  So, Earl said today on the show, it looks like a guy.  Thanks, Earl.  Thanks, Earl.  What?  Anything else before we shut your mic off?  What did I do now?  The problem is you did nothing.  You asked me for a comment, I gave one. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Very good.  There he goes, Earl.  Another brilliant appearance from Earl.  Earl, coming this summer.  A black man dressed all in black.  All right.  And as we go to break, going out to dinner and not picking up the tab.  It's Earl.  Earl, when was the last time you paid...  Wait a minute.  I want to clear this up right now.  Oh, there we go.  Come on.  Do I or do I not?  I hear some nigger rage, motherfucker.  Come on.  Come on, Earl.  This whole idea.  What do I do every time a check comes? 
[02:00:00]  Run.  Run.  Don't fail me now.  The first word...  You leave an Earl-shaped breakout in the wall.  The first thing I say is, what is my damage?  What is your damage?  Yeah, I said, what?  Your damage is you never pay the bill.  What?  I always offer to pay.  He was like...  No, Earl.  You offer to pay?  Earl.  Yes.  Earl, here's the deal.  You've got to offer to pay for the other guy, too.  Not just your share.  I've never seen Earl ready to pick up the tab.  I pick up a lot of tabs.  It would be nice if someone picked up a tab for me every once in a while.  Ben picks up a tab every once in a while. 
[02:00:30]  Norton picks up a tab.  I always offer...  And you always say, don't worry about it.  Always.  Always.  Because you open up your wallet and there's a lot of dust on it.  Like, it's not opened a lot.  Wait, where's Opie's wallet is saying this?  Mix 1027 cards come out.  Dude, I don't have to defend myself.  I pick up a lot of checks when it comes right down there.  All right?  Without question, but...  The old T-Rex arm thing is just a funny bit, sure.  But when it comes down to business, I'm picking up checks.  No, absolutely.  But I always offer.  You have to offer to pay for others. 
[02:01:00]  That's the key.  Not just your share.  Always offer.  It's almost like you want to pull out a calculator and figure it out to the penny.  No.  What's the tip?  Where to what percent?  Earl.  It's Earl Douglasburg.  I understand you don't make much money.  But I always offer.  Do you rub a mezuzza when you go in your front door of your house?  No?  No mezuzza?  What are you hiding under that black Yankee cap, Earl?  What's wrong, Steve? 
[02:01:30]  Do you have payas?  Oh.  Do you have payas on the side of your head under that hat?  Do you flop the little curly cues up underneath it?  Is that what that's called?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Oh, payas.  Are you hiding a yarmulke underneath that Yankee hat?  No.  All right, listen.  Thank you, Earl.  I'll let you pay next time, okay?  And then...  You want to take us all out to dinner, Earl, and foot the bill?  I don't care.  I'll pay.  I've always offered to pay.  We'll go somewhere nice.  Nice.  We're going to wake the fuck up.  Hey, kids.  It's Opie and Anthony's Funhouse. 
[02:02:00]  Hold on tight, kids.  Strap in, kids.  Starring Opie.  He is handsome.  Anthony.  He's got a huge hog.  And Lil Jimmy Norton.  What a faggot.  What a dick.  We're going to have all kinds of fun today, kids.  Ugh.  Tell him, Opie.  Girls having their hoo-hahs being blown up by firecrackers.  Take a hatchet to a girl's skull.  Girls getting punched.  Girls getting run over by buses.  We're going to have some yummy treats, too.  Angel dust.  Acid.  LSD.  Bocaine. 
[02:02:30]  Bacch.  BCP.  Carolyn.  Crack.  Today, we're going to learn all about...  A whale's vagina.  And a special surprise for one lucky audience member.  Oh, yuck!  It's a doggy poop.  So come aboard, kid.  Put on your laughing hats and tea bag of relatives.  It's Opie and Anthony's Funhouse.  You fucking puppet.  Isn't that lovely?  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, Steve-O in studio.  Yes.  Speaking of paper cuts, I think we talked about that a little while ago.  Steve-O did some paper cuts during the... 
[02:03:00]  Jackass the movie.  During the Jackass the movie.  Oh, they were using manila envelopes.  Ah!  Where did we get them?  Know where they did it?  Storm...  They did it right between...  And the webbing between the thumb and pointer finger.  They did paper cuts there.  Ah!  And the corners of the mouth.  Yeah, let me try the one.  Stop it!  I can't even talk about this!  A manila folder across your dickhole.  Oh!  No, right there.  The webbing watch.  Watch this, guys.  No.  Ah! 
[02:03:30]  I can't.  Steve-O in studio.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Do you ever take the corner of a manila envelope and just poke it into your eye?  Just the sharp paper corner against the eyeball?  No.  You know what I like to do?  I like to take tinfoil and just chew on it.  You know what I like to do?  Lick a napkin?  I know.  Licking a napkin is awful, but a folded paper towel, a soft bounty towel, because your tongue  kind of, like, dries and bounces on it.  And then I like to grab a cock and squeeze it and go, attaboy! 
[02:04:00]  Let's listen to Steve-O when he stopped by to say hi.  The worst of Opie and Anthony's.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Turn down the music.  Anthony's playing GTA live on our program.  San Andreas. 
[02:04:30]  Wow, you got out of that mess, Anthony.  Here, have Steve-O.  Actually, Steve-O's still passed down the hall, but I think we just woke him up.  Get somebody in here to play.  Grand Theft Auto while we talk and get this show on the road here.  The cop almost got me out of the car.  Get the hell out of there, Anthony.  Nice.  Ran over two cops.  He's back on the road.  He's rocking.  Knocking over the telephone poles.  There's the cop.  I am in trouble. 
[02:05:00]  I just ran over a hooker.  Just ran over a hooker.  All right, get the hell out.  Dude, beat the hell out of the cops.  All right, here you go.  He's out of the car.  He has no weapons.  Punch that guy.  Oh, they're shooting at you, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wasted.  I am one dead brother laying in the street.  Yeah, you can play this on your computer or on a... 
[02:05:30]  No, this is just PlayStation for now.  They said in, like, July they're going to have a PC version.  Which would you prefer?  PC.  Why is that better?  First of all, I'm not a big PlayStation controller guy.  I'd rather have the mouse and keyboard.  Because I always get confused with these damn controllers.  They never make sense.  I'm going to have to get all re-acclimated to PlayStation controllers.  Anthony, this show is just getting worse and worse, by the way.  I can't tell if it's the game or Steve-O.  Now, Steve-O was passed out near the elevators. 
[02:06:00]  We were able to get him inside the XM facility.  But now he's passed out right outside the studio, right?  Is he on the floor?  Fast to sleep on the floor.  He is fast to sleep.  America, asshole.  I'm an asshole.  All right, well...  This looks really fun.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's just shooting everybody.  We got Steve from foundrymusic.com.  He's just blowing away the homies as he's running down the street.  Nice.  Oh, you're shooting homies in the back.  You're so caught.  All right.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, you got the cops. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  What's with the light?  What's with the glowing stuff on there?  That's like a targeting thing, I think.  Here, stop him.  Get ready to get creamed, asshole.  Yeah, this dude is...  Hey, Steve-O.  Yeah, dude.  You're up, man.  This dude is a bad mother-effer.  Uh-oh.  You hear me?  All right.  It's you and the cop now.  Dude, don't run away from the cop.  Take it to him.  You don't have a weapon?  Take it to him right there.  Take it to him.  You got scraps, son.  Nice.  Nice left arm.  You got scraps, son.  Yeah.  Oh, you're kicking his ass, Steve. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, he's down.  Stomp him.  He just stomped the cop.  Cops back up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Is this what you guys call radio?  Yeah, we just play video game.  I'm not even in this video game, man.  This is total bull.  Oh, you're dead.  You're so dead.  Now you're gone.  No, he's still happening.  Oh, he's...  He got on the cop's motorcycle.  Oh, he just hit a pole.  He's starting to get the hell out of there.  Come on, Steve.  Get on the road.  Here we go.  He's doing.  All right.  He's getting the hell out of there. 
[02:07:30]  He's hitting walls.  You're not too good on the motorcycle, are you?  So far, he's out running the cop, though.  How many...  He's got two stars out of six, so the cops are kind of after him.  You guys really have mellowed out since I saw you last night.  Yeah.  You have no idea.  This is what we do.  We just watch video games and do the play-by-play.  We do play-by-play of video games.  That's what the show is all about.  What about these video games I'm in, man?  Why don't you play my video games? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, which ones you got?  I'm in Tony Hawk Underground 2.  Right.  ESPN NFL 2005.  Yeah, but do you get to kill anyone during the Tony Hawk game?  There's no crowbars over the head.  He gets to kill you?  I know.  The skateboarding video games are kind of like, you know...  I need more blood.  I shouldn't say it, but I don't play any video games.  I need more bloodshed.  Your life is a video game.  What the hell do you need video games for?  You're a live-action game.  All right.  The homie's off the bike.  As soon as he gets killed, then we'll say hi to Steve-O. 
[02:08:30]  Man, he's taking the cops out still.  Oh, you're done.  Oh, you're so done.  Nightstick against the gun.  Oh, the cop's taking you out.  Oh, he knocks that cop out.  I don't think this game is going to do anything for racial harmony.  No, not at all.  All the cops are white, and all the bad guys are black guys.  What's the name of this game?  Accurate?  All right.  The homie stole the cop car.  Jesus.  Now there's three stars.  Oh, you're up to three. 
[02:09:00]  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  He's not going to get out of this one.  Not at all, man.  All right.  He's tooling down the road in the cop car.  Oh, head on with another cop.  Head on with another cop.  His car's smoking.  It's looking really grim.  He just ran over a cop.  Oh, they got the helicopter cops out now.  You are so done.  Oh, they got him in a corner.  His car's on fire.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out of the vehicle.  All right.  The homie's running around.  Oh, nice.  He got out of it.  I think he killed about five cops when the car exploded.  All right.  He's running back.  Oh, you got a shotgun?  Oh, you're so done.  They got the helicopters in the sky. 
[02:09:30]  You got a shotgun, though.  That's pretty good.  Oh, wasted.  You're dead.  So far, so good.  I'm digging the new GTA San Andreas.  He was doing pretty good.  Very good, Steve.  Hey, Steve-o.  What's up, buddy?  Chilling, man.  How are you guys doing?  Yeah.  Great.  We're rocking here on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, I think this is my first time ever on satellite radio.  Really?  I'm completely ignorant.  Do we have no commercials whatsoever?  You can do whatever you want.  You can curse.  Yeah, yeah, really?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  You got no limits.  Know what you should do?  You should get the cursing out of the way first, because the first show we just...  We're allowed to say shit and fuck?  Yeah.  You just curse, get that out of the way, and then we do the fun stuff.  Isn't that amazing?  Because I was going to say, it's not like when I used to visit you guys that I had a  lot of limits.  Yeah, I know.  You really didn't have any limits then anyway, so it's pretty much the same.  Speaking of which, anybody got any grass?  No one's got any pot?  Where's your peeps?  Yeah, what happened, man?  I don't know, man.  I flew from Los Angeles, and I stepped off an airplane like an hour ago. 
[02:10:30]  Really?  Yeah, I was looking for someone holding a sign that said Steve-O or something, but knowing  my crackpot management, it's just...  Nothing?  Yeah.  Usually, I remember when you came in on the other show, though, you had a lot of people  with you.  Yeah.  They were like videotaping stuff, and then you had Dee with you.  Yeah.  How's Dee?  You know, Dee fell off the place of the planet, Dee.  We haven't heard from her.  Really?  All right, you moved on from Dee.  Yeah, but I made it through a physical months after. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you did?  Yeah, a real point of concern.  You didn't have the hiv?  Yeah, no.  That was the one I got away with.  With everything he does, that's the thing he's worried about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting the hiv.  But you're all clean?  You checked out clean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I cleared for life insurance.  In a really shady move when my lawyer took life insurance out on me.  Oh!  What a smart move, man.  Yeah.  That lawyer's thinking ahead.  That's a sure thing, just waiting to come in.  Absolutely.  That's better than playing the stock market. 
[02:11:30]  They came up with a $3 million policy on my life.  You know what the premiums must be on insurance for Steve-O?  Yeah, but I don't know.  Like, they brought me in for some special meeting and sat down with, like, an insurance consultant.  And we filled out all the paperwork accurately, but, you know.  Are there things that they say you can't do now?  Well, they called me a performer in the, like, uh, that I was in, that, um, I performed physical comedy.  Oh, is that what they call it? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't lie, but, uh.  Physical comedy?  Yeah.  Swimming in a river with fucking bears?  With trout on you?  Man, this is going to be weird to, like, just swear on the radio.  I know.  Shit.  It's going to be great when you go on regular radio now and you're cursing all the time, you know?  No way.  What happens?  He sensitizes everybody.  Why do you have shit and fuck on you?  That's not doing that.  I do, yeah.  I see the new tattoos.  Oh, my God.  I got a bunch of tattoos.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are, that's, uh, tats.  Those are tats?  Yeah, they're like prison tattoos, man. 
[02:12:30]  They're on his knuckles.  One says shit, one says fuck.  Oh, we see.  I got a big dick on my arm.  You can, let me see that shit.  He got a, we got a tattoo of a big dick on your arm.  He's got a leaky penis on his bicep.  Yeah.  Why, Steve-o, why?  I don't know, man.  Like, where's the, that's hilarious, man.  I decided to shoot him.  Let me see the famous one from the Jackass movie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's got the, there's that one, the portrait, but I want to see the one, the smile, the happy  face that you got in the, uh, Hummer. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, there's the, the Hummer tattoo.  I'm chilling.  I got shit fuck on my knuckles.  I got a pot leaf on my one wrist, upside down pentagram on the other.  I just carved an upside down cross into my shoulder.  That shit fuck on your knuckles pretty much guarantees you'll be doing what you're doing  now for the rest of your life.  There's no other career choices you can make.  There's no branching off to maybe the executive sector of IBM or something.  Yeah, but when I, when I become, when I become a, uh, a parent.  Yeah, what are you going to do there?  Well, no, I'm going to, I'm going to take the T and change it into a P. 
[02:13:30]  Ship.  Ship, and then, uh, the U, the U turns into an O and says, so ship book.  Ship book.  We had to put nautical literature.  At least he's thinking how to get rid of it.  My uncle's a gay sailor in the Navy, so.  Ship book.  I like it.  That's thinking.  I don't think my uncle's really gay.  He's, he's, he's the real deal though, man.  Who puts a leaky penis title on their face?  Yeah, what was that about?  Yeah, you didn't just decide to do that. 
[02:14:00]  That had to be a bet gone wrong or something.  Yeah, um, I was in this relationship, uh, I was in a relationship with a girl that I was  really trying to make work.  And, and it wasn't at work.  So I tattooed myself in every way I could, I could think of myself.  Wait, that, that was done out of like being pissed off?  I was like, I was like, yeah.  You were mad at yourself?  I wasn't mad at myself.  I was, I was, I was trying to get out of this young girl's life before I ruined it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  How old was she, Steve?  A real sweetheart.  Well, she, she's almost 21.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  That's the ultimate father nightmare is bringing Steve-O home.  You're 21 years old.  Daddy, here's my new boyfriend.  Nice dick tattoo.  Yeah, I've got a, I've got a new girlfriend now and I just went to go visit her, visit  her mom in Denmark and her, her mom just loves my tattoos.  Really?  Yeah.  They love the shit and the fuck, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.  And of course in that, there, uh, there's no father in that, uh, family, right?  Um.  He left many years ago after, he did the old touch and run, did he? 
[02:15:00]  Nah, I, I, I'm not, I'm not sure what the circumstances are, but it's a great family and  my girlfriend's very wonderful.  She's a big time famous model.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  He's getting, he's getting the pooh-ha, man.  Really famous?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's brag about my girlfriend.  Well, who is she?  Can we see pictures of her?  Um, yeah, you guys, instead of playing damn video games, you should Google her.  Her name's, uh, Mae Anderson.  Oh, oh.  Anderson with an E-N.  I will definitely Google her. 
[02:15:30]  Anderson with an E-N.  Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model, a sports officer in swimsuit edition, spokesmodel  for Wonderbra.  I gotta see now.  Yeah, bring her up, dude.  You've got me intrigued.  There's a lot of people that think I'm a little bit fruity.  You know, some of the things you do, man.  Yeah, but maybe when you're watching the show, but we've hung with you many times.  You're far from that.  On Wild Boys, some of the stuff you do with Chris is not only hysterically funny, but 
[02:16:00]  it's so gay.  Yeah.  Like, it's not even, some of the stuff you do isn't even like, wow, that's funny that  two heterosexual guys are doing something so gay.  It's like, you have to be gay to do that.  It's like, so incredibly gay.  I mean, the way we see it, we act so gay that, I mean, it's obvious that we're straight.  Oh, yeah.  It's just so over the top.  You couldn't be that gay and be gay.  Yeah.  So what's taking so long, man?  My girl's all over the internet.  Holy.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  You might be going out with the hottest girl in the world.  Yeah, dude.  Wow.  Come on.  What?  What are you, insane?  Thank God she's not a weekend.  If you want to play along at home, just Google May Anderson, E-N at the end, and look what  Steve-O is banging.  Oh, my goodness.  Is this Jim?  She's unbelievable.  She really is unbelievable.  How tall is she?  She's taller than you, though, right?  That's always a little weird, no?  I think, I don't know, I'm 5'11 and 3 quarters, and she might have me by a 
[02:17:00]  quarter inch or so.  Wow.  But then the heels really ruin it for me.  Oh, my God.  Just Google her name, and you get like a bunch of pictures of her.  Yeah, May Anderson.  How did you hook up with her?  Johnny Knoxville introduced me to her.  He was done with her in Hollywood Johnny Knoxville?  You know what I think?  I don't know.  I guess once she figured out that I'm not exactly the way I portray myself on TV, I think. 
[02:17:30]  You're not?  You mean you're not gay?  Guy comes in, fell asleep in the hallway.  I don't want to say that, like I portrayed a false image.  No.  But, you know, I don't know.  I don't know how the hell I got her.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  Man, you must really work hard at keeping this girl, right?  Oh, dude, yeah.  Like, you just know one fuck up, and it's over, Johnny. 
[02:18:00]  She is gone.  You're calling her every ten minutes, making sure she's with no one else.  Yeah, I hate to admit it.  But, yeah, I don't know how guys are.  Do people just wince when you walk by arm-in-arm?  Do they just get angry?  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of the time, yeah.  Oh, my God.  You look at that and go like, and it's live, and he just goes into bed with her.  Wow.  This interview is off to a great start.  That is amazing.  You've definitely upgraded since the last time we saw you. 
[02:18:30]  Although Dee was quite fine in her own room.  Yeah, but she was completely insane.  So what has nine arms and totally sucks?  What?  Def Leppard.  Yeah.  That would even be funnier if it was 1996.  I think that would have been pretty hot in 86.  Yeah, true.  He's doing great radio, considering he was just passed out two minutes ago.  I know.  He snaps right to it.  I know.  You were sleeping near the elevator. 
[02:19:00]  That was good.  You were out cold, bro.  I know, man.  When was the last time you went to bed?  I slept a little bit on the airplane, that's it.  And I had a middle seat.  I had a middle seat on JetBlue, but I took enough Xanax.  I didn't care.  Do the people recognize you that are sitting next to you?  Yeah.  It's kind of funny.  A lot of people are like, oh, what are you doing?  Way back here in coach.  You know, like in the middle.  It's like, hey, we're doing a plane crash gag today.  I'm going to scare the crap out of everyone on the plane.  I joined the Al-Qaeda. 
[02:19:30]  It's going to be great.  It's a goof for MTV.  Yeah.  I love Wild Boys.  The show's hysterical.  Hey, thank you, man.  Thank you.  And they send you, like, I'm amazed at the place they send you, because I didn't think  MTV had any money.  I know.  How do they even send you to those places?  I mean, I guess that's probably why they don't pay me that much.  Australia.  You've got to get all kinds of shots and everything, right?  We have three shots away from being vaccinated from rabies for life.  Really?  Yeah, so I can get attacked by any animal I want. 
[02:20:00]  That is cool.  I don't know.  You must get, like, a mean case of the runs, though, and stuff.  Time to time, but that's mostly from the drugs and the booze.  That's not the food or the water?  You know, I make a point of drinking tap water on every continent.  You do?  You just drink the water that's coming out of whatever?  Yeah.  You know, I firmly believe it doesn't kill you.  It makes you stronger.  Yeah.  It gets your resistance up.  Every new country I go to, like, I like to drink the tap water.  And I think that I'm a really healthy person. 
[02:20:30]  You probably are, man.  If you drink purified water all day, every day, dude, then...  Any little thing's going to get you.  Exactly.  It's like living in an incubator.  As soon as you get out of there, you're done.  And you're getting bitten.  What's, like, the scariest thing you've been bitten by on that show?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I had...  I had...  I had...  I had a Haitian.  Well, no, I just recently shot this commercial for Nintendo.  And it turned out to be the most dangerous situation I've ever been in my life.  Like, they had...  It's just...  Nintendo's got this new product coming out that wirelessly... 
[02:21:00]  Like, you can play against your buddies, like, wirelessly, you know, whatever.  It's like sort of a cell phone.  And so, you know, we've got this scene, and I'm up in this tree.  And, you know, I'm playing against Chris.  He's charging around on this big elephant.  And, you know, they've got chicken tied to the tree branch I'm on.  So there's these three huge African lions, like, you know, jumping up to try and get the meat.  And I'm sitting on this branch, you know, like...  And I tell them, I go, why?  You know what is going to stop these fucking lions? 
[02:21:30]  I love saying fuck.  What's going to stop these fucking lions from just climbing up the tree and killing you?  And killing you, dragging you off by the throat.  And they're like, oh, don't worry, dude.  Lions can't climb trees, dude.  You know, like, lions don't climb trees.  So I'm just thinking...  And then our director says, yeah, but that is a pretty mellow tree.  So there I am.  I'm out on this branch.  It's like 10 feet above the ground.  Take one, you know.  They should drop the slate.  And then the lion bolts straight up the goddamn tree, dude.  Like, complete pandemonium. 
[02:22:00]  It comes out and just, like, pins me down to this branch.  Get out of here, holy shit.  I can show you on my computer, man.  Like, I have this contraband that I'm not supposed to have.  Like, this footage of the...  Oh, I definitely want to see that, yeah.  Yeah, we're going on...  And we're going to play the clip on Jay Leno, too, this coming November 5th.  Do you realize, when I watch the show, and I know a lot of people think this, when I watch it, do you realize people are watching this going, one of these guys, if not both, are going to die during doing this show? 
[02:22:30]  We're going to cross out the Z and continue on as a wild boy.  Because it's really dangerous.  I mean, it's not even a set-up thing.  It's not like the old Wild Kingdom where Marlon Perkins would be in a blind somewhere and, you know, they'd show this footage from miles away.  Which is another thing, I think, is hysterical.  You look at old nature shows, and you realize what it's evolved into is this guy and Chris going out and almost getting killed by these animals.  Yeah.  Have you turned anything down? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, there's been some things, yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, and overall, Jackass, we were putting ourselves at risk of, you know, bumps and bruises.  Yeah.  It's just straight up shit.  But this is killing yourself at risk that, yeah, these things can kill you.  When you guys went in the water with the bear.  Yeah.  And that big.  That was really sketchy.  That was really kind of scary.  There was a time when we jumped off the boat.  And, you know, I should mention, too, that actually yesterday, out in the stores came out our Wild Boys complete first season DVD. 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  Nice.  Got to pick that up.  And if you thought the show was gay.  Wait till you watch the extras.  There's full anal intercourse.  Intercourse.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And how about a moment of silence for Chris Pontius?  We just had his bachelor party.  Oh, he's getting married?  He's getting married?  Yeah, he's getting married this Friday.  To Steve-O.  You know what?  In San Francisco.  Well, no, in Massachusetts, it's where it's legal.  So I told him.  When I first heard about it, I said, Chris, you know, we need to go to Massachusetts and get married with a prenup. 
[02:24:00]  And then we need to go to Utah, and then you can start adding spouses if you expect any silence at your wedding out of me.  So he's getting married, and it is a lovely young lady?  She is, yeah.  She's a lovely Irish lass.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See, now that's somebody, I would assume, was completely gay.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Based on his character.  Yeah, no, Chris really isn't gay at all either.  And even though I think the marriage, you know, like whether or not I'm a dick for saying it, I think the marriage has a lot to do with getting his Irish lass a green card. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, she's like right from Ireland?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, so it could be like a set-up, kind of one hand wash to the other.  She gets a green card, he gets a beard.  So it doesn't look so gay.  You could say, you know, look, I can't be gay.  I'm married to a lovely young lady.  Yeah, no, that's his term.  But the bachelor party was very interesting on Monday night.  Anyway, old Knoxville couldn't make it, so he sent us some strippers. 
[02:25:00]  It's only another movie, is he?  Yeah.  That guy has probably the best agent ever, ever.  The guy turns up in everything.  He's on fire, yeah.  I think he's up to like five million a movie now.  Really?  Yeah.  But, you know, like all he ever wanted in the beginning was to be an end, you know.  It was a means to an end, which he called out.  And nobody can call him a hypocrite or a sellout because...  No, the guy took a lot of pain to get where he is.  He did exactly what he intended to do.  A beanbag gun that was shot at his abdomen.  I know.  Oh, man.  What's he going to get shot with next? 
[02:25:30]  Well, he got shot for real, but they never showed it on MTV.  What?  Yeah, he put on a bulletproof vest.  Oh, the bulletproof vest.  Where is that video?  Can you see that anywhere?  Does he have that now?  He got shot in the desert with a bulletproof vest on, but MTV refused to show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that was a video that was put out by Larry Flint Publications.  Oh, there you go.  So it is out there somewhere.  It's out there, but they didn't license any of the damn music for it.  So, you know, like...  Oh, really?  So should they want to do anything with it, you know, it's just like one, you know, lawsuit 
[02:26:00]  after another.  Great.  I mean, I'm glad I'm on the radio telling Brad about that.  Yeah, fuck you, Larry.  What's he going to do?  Yeah.  Yeah, so anyway, Knoxville sent some strippers to Chris's bachelor party, and they were dudes.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and just to make it worse, they were wearing all this crazy bondage gear and giving each  other blowjobs. 
[02:26:30]  Great party.  Wow.  Great party.  Isn't it?  Yeah, like, honest to God, I think it's the only bachelor party in the history of the world  that the bride wasn't concerned about.  You know, like, it was the song.  Gay sex going on at the bachelor party.  It was the first time I've ever actually seen a dude give another dude a blowjob.  Oh.  Yeah, that can't be much of a treat to watch.  Well, I don't know.  Guy pulls away, and he's got that razor burn on his testicles. 
[02:27:00]  I was posing for all kinds of pictures, like, right kind of in the scene, too.  I didn't care.  Of course not.  Dude, I saw something.  You were on John McEnroe's show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're actually taping John McEnroe today.  I think they're bringing in a film crew, right?  In a little while?  Are they?  Because you're going to do some stunts.  Maybe you can't.  Yeah, I came totally unprepared, and I walked straight off an airplane in here.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  You usually do.  Remember the thing we set up at the old station where he jumped over the console? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I knocked off the on-air sign.  Yeah, yeah.  He broke the place.  Yeah, that was a brilliant laugh.  But he was on John McEnroe a couple weeks ago, and he let Johnny Mac serve into his body.  Served tennis balls out there.  Wow, that must have hurt.  The welts you had were ridiculous.  I told him that I wasn't too afraid because he was well over the hill.  Dude, you had to piss him off, man.  John McEnroe didn't hold back at all.  The welts he had at the end of the show were crazy.  How fast do you think he served? 
[02:28:00]  I don't know, man, but.  They were up there.  Yeah, no, yeah.  He took one just off the testicle.  I know.  Upper thigh.  How far away were you?  I don't know.  Max 30 feet.  Yeah, 30 feet probably.  And he's connecting like that?  He's still, like, got his aim, huh?  Pretty much full serve.  Pretty much full serve.  Yeah.  Still able to aim, though, and get hit?  I was wearing a cup, and I told him to aim for it, but he kept getting me in the thighs.  I think he took, like, three shots, something like that.  I know, yeah.  And then he finally goes, that's it.  Yeah, I kind of ran out of the feet.  He got him on the soft spot on the upper, like, thigh. 
[02:28:30]  He's like, that's it.  I'm done.  Well, yeah, I mean.  That was pretty crazy.  You ever play asses up handball years ago?  In the old days, sure.  And then you try to get the ball to bounce off the wall and back into his nuts?  You try to hit him in the ass?  In front of this guy?  No, I'm just saying that's what you're doing.  That would hurt.  Did I perform the butt chug on the show with you guys one time?  Oh, yes, you did the butt chug.  He did do the butt chug?  Of course he did.  Yeah, I took a funnel with the hose, and I put it in my butt.  I put beer in his butt.  Yeah, and then I tried to fart beer in my mouth. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I really don't know how to outdo that, dude.  Oh, yeah, how do you talk something like that?  I don't know.  We got a show off for Steve-O today.  We got to get a couple to have sex for him.  Oh, my God.  That's what happened to you guys.  You guys solicited pretty serious crimes to occur in churches.  Crimes to the church, crimes to humanity.  You kind of heard about our little story?  I was just prouder than I could be.  Yeah.  At the end of the day, or at the end of that day, I guess, I really thought that it would 
[02:29:30]  all work out for the better.  I guess now it ultimately has.  Yeah, but it was two years of doing nothing.  It was two years?  We haven't seen you in like two, two and a half years.  It was two years of exile, just doing nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Trying to just X-ing off the days on the calendar.  That's pretty good.  Because I really thought that overnight that that would turn into the best thing that ever  happened to you.  Eventually, it will be the best thing that happened.  Yeah.  Eventually.  We're still eking it out. 
[02:30:00]  It definitely made us a little bigger.  That's funny.  Yeah.  In that time, I've been arrested for international drug smuggling.  Have you?  Yeah.  Drug smuggling?  Yeah, it was amazing.  What happened there?  Were you a mule?  No.  It was really only for the purposes of filming one of my DVDs.  I was in Norway, and we were getting ready to go to the airport to fly to Sweden, and  I had all this hash.  Did you tape it to your body?  No, no, even better, even better.  Ended up in a Turkish prison? 
[02:30:30]  I took a condom, and I put all this marijuana and hash in the condom, and I tied it up in  a knot, and swallowed it.  And it was really such an ambitious package to swallow.  Really?  Was it kind of big?  I choked on it.  I got stuck in my throat.  How the hell do you swallow something like that?  Yeah, it got stuck in my throat, and I was choked on it.  I was puking up blood trying to get it out.  Did you just think, oh my God, if I die doing this, as you're doing it, like, oh no, they're  going to, Steve-O found with hash and pot and it's stuck in his throat and condom. 
[02:31:00]  And yeah, I swallowed it down, because you remember when I came in, I was promoting my  first video, and there was the dog ate the condom.  So I figured if a dog can do it, then so can I, you know, and so I swallowed this condom  for a pot and a hash, and it took seven days for me to finally crap it out, because I was  just, it was my vision, you know, I crap it out and then, you know, open it up.  It was his vision.  My vision, yeah.  Did every crap, you went picking through it with nothing, like a prospector. 
[02:31:30]  I found it too, and, you know, my whole idea, like the punchline is, you know, like, finally  I take the pot out, you know, and, you know, roll a joint or whatever, and I smoke and, now  that's good shit, you know, like, and I was all excited about it, and over the six days  I spent touring Sweden, I bragged to the media, every newspaper, every TV show, like, how are  you doing?  Well, I, uh, I think I might die of intentional strangulation, because I've got all this marijuana 
[02:32:00]  in my body, you know, like, and where it turns out Sweden has, like, the strictest drug laws  in Europe.  Really?  So, yeah, so.  Who knew that?  Right after I pooped it out and got my punchline, I was so happy.  Then, uh, the next morning I got ambushed by undercover cops leaving the Swedish hotel,  and, uh, I spent five days in Swedish prison.  How is Swedish prison?  It's really pretty mellow, man.  It sounds kind of nice.  You're in a Swedish prison.  I know.  They give you, they give you a cocoa with marshmallows in it.  Oh, man, I was able to smoke cigarettes, and then, you know, I could even, like, they 
[02:32:30]  took me to buy, buy junk food, and the cigarettes just puffing away, and, I mean, granted, I  had to poop into plastic bags in front of dudes for five days in a row.  Oh, they wanted to see what else you had in there?  Yeah, because they weren't entirely convinced.  What a crap job they have.  I know, and I was making fun of them, too, for doing my job.  Taking through crap, you know.  Oh, really?  But, yeah, and I had that, and then, uh, I also had, um, I, for a while, I was facing  eight years in prison on, uh, two felony charges out of Louisiana, stemming from stapling my 
[02:33:00]  scrotum to my thigh.  Yeah, I read about that.  We read about that one.  Yeah, that was big, big trouble.  What was that, an obscene?  Yeah, it was, it was another case of obscenity, which, uh, you know, I mean, I'd, like, I'll  go ahead and call myself a celebrity, and, and, uh, that's so funny, but, like, the truth  is, no celebrities have ever been convicted of obscenity, like, there's, like, Jim Morrison,  Larry Flint, Marilyn Manson, two live crew, Lenny Bruce, yeah, the list just goes on and  on, and, and, uh, um, so, so, yeah, I'm really proud, like, I feel like stapling my balls 
[02:33:30]  to my leg, really let me join this, this, this group of American heroes, you know?  But you were in a club, or?  Yeah, I was in a club, yeah, and, uh.  So the people in the club knew what they were getting.  Yeah, it was an audience.  And, like, you walked into a restaurant in front of a family and started doing it.  And there was, there was an isolated incident that had nothing to do with me with, uh, you  know, a bouncer's injuring an audience member, which kind of brought all the attention to it,  so they threw the book at me for obscenity, and. 
[02:34:00]  Is this your mugshot?  Yeah, check out how bummed I am.  Oh, man, you look bummed.  I was in so much trouble, dude, I don't know, I don't care.  Yeah, we got the arrest report here.  Anybody can make fun of me as well.  Jackass star Steve-O, a.k.a. Stephen Glover, was arrested in August 2002.  That was when we got screwed over.  Oh, look at that.  What day was it, man?  Do you know offhand?  I was arrested, I think it was, like, August 1st or something.  Oh, okay.  We destroyed our lives on August 16th, if you're playing along at home.  Yeah.  Actually, the 15th. 
[02:34:30]  I had, you know, I was really in a lot of trouble, and ultimately the courts, you know,  like, I guess the judge reviewed the tape of my performance, and it came down, it was the  court decision that stapling your balls to your leg is an act of art, and it's protected.  So, yeah, so.  Anything is an act of art, and it's protected, if you do it.  That's amazing.  I know, I know.  Like, I'm glad the state of Louisiana really considers me to be this artist.  Louisiana.  Were there cops in the place? 
[02:35:00]  No, no, no, no.  I got arrested on a fugitive warrant two weeks later.  How did that happen?  It was because an audience member had been videotaping it, and they thought, wow, that  was messed up, and they sent the tape to the news, which thought, wow, that's probably  pretty illegal.  That's probably pretty illegal.  Yeah, then the news sent it to the cops, and then, you know, it was two weeks later.  I was back in Los Angeles when they issued the warrant.  So what, did they extradite you?  Yeah, oh my God.  Like, you're not even going to believe me, but I literally got arrested with a $1.12 million 
[02:35:30]  bail.  Are you kidding me?  No, because the state of Louisiana, you know, and it was a case of the district attorney was  running for a district judge, I guess, and it was all like.  How did they justify it?  Because they're saying I was a flight risk, because I was no longer in the state.  So there was this principle to second degree battery charge for what the bouncers did, and  they gave me a principle to that.  Like, I was somehow an accessory to that.  And with that charge came a $120,000 bail. 
[02:36:00]  And then separately, just for the one stapled through my ball bag, I got a full million.  The million dollar staple.  Yeah.  A million dollar bail.  They don't give that to some people that kill people.  I know.  I don't think the Robert Blake.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he only had a million.  And I didn't, you know, I had no way of posting that kind of bail.  You can't post that kind of bail.  So, yeah, so I was sitting on Robert Downey Jr. block in L.A. County Jail for five days. 
[02:36:30]  Five days you had to sit there, because they had a million dollar bond.  Yeah.  And, you know, we had to wait to get me in front of a judge to, you know, have a bail  reduction hearing to say, look, you know, this guy's not a flight risk.  He can't hide anywhere.  Yeah, you know.  Can't hide, yeah.  Yeah, so.  He's got a penis tattoo on his own, for God's sake.  How are you going to miss this guy?  Yeah, so we got it on.  That's not the type of tattoo you want if you're in the joint.  Yeah.  You might want to cover that up if you're going to be in the joint.  Yeah.  You want a matching one in your mouth, son? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, sure.  But, yeah, we got it down.  We got it knocked down to $150,000.  Oh, man.  And my accountant put that up.  He should have just been released on his own recognizance.  What justifies any bail when all you've done is put a staple through your sack?  I know, I know.  God, damn.  And I'm not sure if I can get girls pregnant after all the staples that have been through my ball sack.  Oh.  But I can damn well fuck them.  Good. 
[02:37:30]  You don't want to ruin that girl's body with a baby.  Yeah, exactly.  Jeez.  Hey, what's up with this new DVD?  I'm so proud of it, man.  It's called Steve-O the Early Years.  Oh.  And it's...  How dangerous and irresponsible behavior can lead to fame and fortune.  There you go, kids.  You're teaching them.  It's basically a how-to video.  Like, I would take a video camera and, like, piss a lot of people off.  I mean, I don't know.  I like to describe it as a two-hopper TV A&E biography about the rise to shame. 
[02:38:00]  So called The Rise.  The Rise of Steve-O.  What's the craziest thing on here?  I don't know, man.  There's a lot of early footage.  I mean, you jumping off the roofs, that's pretty crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, it's...  The fire stuff you did was unbelievable.  It's loaded.  It's loaded with stunts, man.  Nice.  And, you know, like, a lot of people just ask me so much.  They'll say, oh, how'd you get into all this?  You know, like, how'd you get your start?  And so finally, I just put together a damn video that tells the story. 
[02:38:30]  There's the start.  And, you know, like, to be honest, like, I mean, it's a change of pace from my other videos,  which isn't kind of non-stop mayhem, but...  Can you get this in stores?  Yeah, absolutely, man.  It's only $9.99 at Best Buy.  $9.99 for the Steve-O DVD.  I don't know what it is, man.  It's really pissing me off, but DVD prices are going way down.  Yeah.  When you finally start putting them out, right?  Yeah, and what's up with this satellite radio business?  No commercials there.  Does that mean, like, we're...  Oh, yeah.  We could just hang.  We could hang, curse, do whatever. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  So...  No, we could take a break so we can regroup, because we want you to do some stuff today.  Yeah, I want to smoke a cigarette.  Like, we're allowed to do that, right?  If we're allowed to say fuck, I think you can smoke a cigarette.  Yeah, why not?  Unless there's a howl-on system in here that'll go off.  Oh, which that...  No, we'll be fine.  No, it's just a water thing.  If that sprinkler goes off, I will laugh myself.  I will laugh my balls off.  I don't think they have howl-on in here.  They just have water.  Like, I smoke a lot.  I recently, actually, you know, I'm so proud of all these arrests I've had since I saw you last. 
[02:39:30]  Well, what about the arrest of your partner there, Chris?  Oh, yeah, that was...  Because they just handed this to me as well.  Yeah, that was brilliant.  The hell are you guys getting arrested?  He was found completely butt-naked, passed out on the roof of a parked SUV on 10th Street in South Beach.  Great.  In Miami.  And what led up to that?  A lot of drinking?  He says that somebody drugged him, but I'm telling you it was him.  And me.  Somebody drugged him.  Yeah, he did. 
[02:40:00]  He drugged himself, and then he yelled and screamed at the cops, and then they pepper sprayed him.  Oh, pepper spray.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, he did not cooperate whatsoever.  He actually threatened to kick...  His quote is, I'm going to kick your posterior.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.  That was in the room.  He just didn't feel like saying S?  Did he laugh at the pepper spray, considering all the other stuff that he's done?  Yeah, no, and pepper spray is nothing to laugh at, man.  No, huh?  Have you ever been pepper sprayed?  I did a stunt called Tabasco Eye Drops, which I had a really hard time with that one. 
[02:40:30]  Well, we've seen you snort the wasabi, right?  I'd rather snort wasabi before Tabasco Eye Drops again.  One of the funniest parts of Jackass the movie is the electrodes.  And they put the electrodes on everybody, and they're all tightening up, and then they put them on the ball sack.  Because you see all the commercials on TV for those things, and you really get the impression that it's for, like, kind of, like, fat ladies.  Yeah.  Like, you know, exercise.  Try to tone the muscles by making them move through electricity instead of moving them yourself. 
[02:41:00]  You know what the sickest stunt in the Jackass movie was?  And it was such a simple one?  The paper cuts.  Oh, shit.  The paper cuts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't even think about it.  Don't make me think about it.  A simple one, but, I mean, in between the fingers.  Oh, stop it.  Where else did you guys do?  Oh, the corners of your mouth.  Oh.  I had one on my nose that didn't make the cut.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was the one that just made me just cringe in the movie theater. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I was, uh, I was, I was.  Right between, just imagine the, look, everyone's just getting all freaked out, man.  I can't even think about it.  Just, you know?  I think for that movie, I'm most proud of the ceiling fan.  Oh, the ceiling fan is great.  I remember telling our director, I was like, dude, like, I want to get a vaulting, I want  a vaulting trampoline, and I want to take out my ceiling fan while it's at full speed.  Our director's like, I like that.  I like that.  All right.  Let me shut the cameras.  Good one.  Yeah.  It's so cool.  Are you guys going to make another movie?  Um, not Jackass. 
[02:42:00]  Jackass, we certainly wouldn't do without Knoxville, but.  Right.  But that's not to say that this boy's going to get any smarter.  Yeah, Johnny doesn't have to do any of that stuff anymore.  It's amazing.  Yeah, but his personal life has always been so much more reckless than his life.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's awesome.  He just rules.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  We're hanging with our...  These are real quick breaks that we take, by the way.  Yeah, it's just four minutes, so you can't even sleep.  Anybody?  Pot?  I can't have a plan, man.  I could really...  I swallowed some, but I'm not supposed to shit it out for another three days. 
[02:42:30]  Honestly, we're trying to be a little more responsible.  We have a lot of nerds that work with us now.  Look, everyone's just taking their head.  No pot.  Pot?  No.  Pot?  God, no.  Nothing.  Nothing?  Shit, fuck.  What happened to us?  So I got a radio station fined one time.  Really?  For telling this joke.  Yeah, you can tell it on this joke.  What do you get when you shove a butcher knife all the way up a baby's ass?  A fine?  I don't know about you, but I get a mean boner. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know how that kind of radio station is in trouble.  Yeah, hmm.  Where they fined $357,000?  What's the difference between a dead baby and a refrigerator?  You can't fuck a refrigerator.  Yeah, I'm loving this radio station.  You guys are so much better now.  All right, let's take a break.  We're hanging with our old pal, Steve-O.  You've got to do one stunt today or something.  I will.  We'll figure something out? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, we'll think about it during the break.  All right, cool.  Man, I didn't tell you about when I got arrested on the airplane for chain smoking.  We'll do that next.  On the airplane?  Yeah.  I haven't been able to smoke on a plane in years.  I'm not going to reveal the name of the airline I'm banned from.  Chip Blow.  I know you took Chip Blow, so.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now, we'll figure something out.  All right, right.  Now, okay, what should we go with?  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony Show?  XM202. 
[02:44:00]  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We have the audio.  What do we have the audio of that you just handed me?  That's mini-me on the Surreal Life.  All right.  How about the audio of him in bed?  Do we have that?  Let's hear this.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:44:30]  That was him in the bed saying, like, I'm all right, I'm all right.  It could be the funniest thing I've ever heard.  I need that online machine.  No, no, no, no.  Do not give that one to Anthony.  Give it to my answer.  No, I need, but we both get it.  You have too many on yours.  No, we both get that one.  I want that one, too.  I absolutely want that one, too.  Come on.  I got boring ones on mine.  I want a cool one.  No, I need that one.  Come on, Ant.  We'll both have it.  No, I won't.  There are certain circumstances you never know where.  I want our listeners to know that it came from me when that. 
[02:45:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  I want that one.  I need it, too.  We're going to fight.  That's a classic.  We're going to fight.  There's already a couple that I would have liked to have had that you have.  Oh, which one do you like from my machine?  I got a couple.  I got, like.  I'll trade you.  I'll trade you.  No, I don't need that guy.  How about we trade?  You have that guy.  I don't care about that guy.  How about we trade?  Give me that one, and you can have one of mine.  Here, I'll give you this one.  No, I don't want that guy. 
[02:45:30]  I don't have crickets.  That could have come in handy.  I'd give it to you, but the button's worn out.  I don't have to replace the button.  How about I'll give you this?  Why on earth would you deny both of us having that?  Why would you deny both of us having that?  Because it's too good.  But I want it, too.  I'll give you this one.  I don't want that one.  Why?  Because you do a great job with that one.  Oh, thank you.  I know when to use that clip. 
[02:46:00]  I'll give you one of my okay terrifics.  No, I don't want that.  I'll give you an okay terrific.  I'll give you an okay terrific, and I'll even sacrifice my favorite clip, this one.  No.  That's terrific.  No, I like that one, but no.  Let me hear the mini-me again.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You should always shoot your feet.  All right.  All right.  No. 
[02:46:30]  I need that.  There's nothing on there you could trade for that.  No, come on.  I must have that one.  I'm all right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  That's funny.  What a...  Wow.  What a drunken little midget.  All right.  All right.  And then he just sounds like a broken kazoo.  What, do you have a shot of beer? 
[02:47:00]  Sounds like a model airplane.  Holy crap.  You can't have those.  What a mess.  No, I need that.  I need that.  That must be.  Wait.  Let me try.  You know how much I want that clip?  I don't care if I get it.  I don't care.  I just don't care.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Meanwhile, back at the show... 
[02:47:30]  That is the funniest goddamn sound ever to come out of anything.  That really is.  Wow, that's good.  Yeah, we're going to have to go to court and see who gets custody of that.  I don't have many on my machine yet.  But that's my job! 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, but you don't do a good job with your job.  What the fuck? Are you insane?  Are you crazy?  You got too many over there, so...  Too many?  I got maybe 30 here. You got hundreds.  Too many?  You have too many.  Here, I'll give you this one.  That's what I'm talking about.  Stupid! You're so stupid!  No, I used to have that one, and I don't want it anymore.  No, no, listen to the replay. You played it at an appropriate point in the show this morning. 
[02:48:30]  Which one?  Oh, what?  The one you threw in that didn't make any sense?  Which one?  Or maybe you throw in Earl where it doesn't make any sense.  Go ahead!  Go ahead!  That was over the intro of the show!  What?  What?  All right, I'll give you this one.  I hate this place!  No, I don't want that one.  Why?  I want Mini-Mix.  All right, but you can't have the I Don't Care song.  No, I don't.  Because we're going to be using this one a lot.  No, that's fine.  All right.  I got to have Mini... 
[02:49:00]  Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't have it, too.  Why don't you share it?  That should be split between both machines.  Because I, you know, I think I can handle this one a little better than he can.  Get out of hell!  I've been working this machine for five years!  I'll use it more appropriately.  How would you use it more appropriately?  I don't know.  I'll just, you know, I'll push the button.  Use it at the beginning of the show for the intro, things like that, and I will use it where  it comes in handy. 
[02:49:30]  All right, but you can't...  If someone...  Put it this way.  Right.  If someone walked into our studio as a guest, and they were really short, and we were all  laughing and wanted to goof on how short they were without actually saying it,  I would hit that button.  You might not be inclined to do it.  And if I thought it and you didn't, people wouldn't get the enjoyment of knowing that  there's a short person walking into the studio.  Or how about this?  Yeah.  Whenever it's time to use the button, I'll just yell, hit the mini-me clip.  Hit the mini-me clip.  Someone.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Can I have it, too, at least?  I have no problem with you also having it.  I think you should share.  Why did you want exclusivity?  That's what I don't understand.  It's too good.  It is very good.  It's so good, it needs to be on both machines.  You've got all the fun shut-up ones.  You have shut-up ones.  I don't think I have shut-up ones.  I don't have any.  I don't feel bad for either one of you tools.  You're supposed to give me the new shut-up one.  Tomorrow?  All right.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck!  You're all right to take me.  Shut up!  Will you shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[02:50:30]  Shut up!  By the way...  I love that one.  By the way, proving that you were asleep at the wheel today.  Why?  We could have used that clip at least 20 times today.  I like your approach better.  See?  I would sit back sometimes and not even do that.  I like the subtle approach on that whole thing.  So you think it's subtle is better at times?  See?  I wasn't stepping on you.  I thought that worked quite nicely.  So we got, um, who's here, uh, Sabrina Sikora. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  Nice.  Chris Rush in the studio.  Where are you going?  I was just saying, I gotta, I gotta leave soon.  Ah.  No, no one would ever say that to your face.  Yes, they would.  They'd call in.  Hi, you suck!  Shut up!  That's when I wanted to shut up thing here.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  You really believe that my approach was better? 
[02:51:30]  Are you insane?  I liked it.  Pete from Astoria.  I was born in Astoria.  Pete?  Now all Greek there.  Pete?  Pete, what's up?  What's up?  All right, guys.  Hi, Pete.  How's everybody doing this morning?  Imagine if his last name was Moss.  I don't know if it sounds like to anyone else, but it sounded like he was having sex in that clip.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  Ah.  No, what happened was he was, um, laying...  Wait, where is it?  I want to play it now.  The mini-meet clip. 
[02:52:00]  It sounds like he's having sex.  I don't know what it sounds like, actually.  He's laying in the bed drunk, and Christopher Knight is comforting him.  Instead of just biting his arm and chest like he should be, a little fat piece of Play-Doh.  He's playing monster, you know.  A little oven-stuffer-roaster body.  That's exactly what he looks like, a Cornish game hen.  He should be gutted and fed to people.  He's sitting around drinking, waiting for Mike Myers' next phone call.  Dude, you've got to see, there's a scene where he's sitting on a ledge, and him and Christopher 
[02:52:30]  and I are drinking, and he actually takes...  He gets drunk, and he falls back, and kind of almost passes out.  But he's such a little nothing that he's like, there's no bending.  It's like he all just falls back at once.  It's like a Stonehenge type of thing.  He just falls back at once.  Just one piece.  Like a weevil.  No joints on him.  No.  You want to just pick him up by the legs, and pull the last 30 seconds of Caligula out,  and smash his face on the steps.  Look at my high boobies when you talk to me, buddy.

This was the first time he stopped by our new show here on XM Satellite Radio.  Right, this is a, yes, stay tuned to this segment because we didn't know if he was dead or not.  That was fun.  This is God's honest truth.  It was really, really scary. 
[02:55:30]  And we just got back on the radio after two and a half years off, more or less.  And then we're thinking, oh great, we've only been back on for a little while and a guy's dead.  This was also the segment we follow him into the bathroom when he's taking a dump.  Oh yeah.  It is so disgusting.  This is a top-notch segment on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  So listen to Tippi Tom stopping by.  It's the worst.  All right.  Want to turn on?  We'll make this feel better about ourselves.  That's right.  You want to turn on the mic outside the studio so we can talk to Tippi Tom? 
[02:56:00]  You're wonderful.  I think you're wonderful.  Oh my gosh.  He's been drinking.  Is he crying?  Is he crying?  No.  Key.  Key.  Can we just light him on fire?  He's fading fast is what he's saying.  He's fading fast.  Hello again, my friend.  He's singing.  It doesn't matter who you are. 
[02:56:30]  Still I'll wait.  Yes, I'll wait.  I love you just the way you are.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  I love you any way you are. 
[02:57:00]  Yes, I do.  Come close to me.  I see song promo.  And be a part of me.  And I'll love you anyway.  Yes, I will any day.  I will love you.  He's singing about a subway drink.  Yes, I will.  I will love you. 
[02:57:30]  This is from Tippi Tom.  And yes, I'll do.  I'll hold you close.  No, you won't.  And you can kiss me if you want.  The microphone's melting.  And yes, I love your kiss.  And I will kiss you too.  This is great.  That's it. 
[02:58:00]  That's it.  All right.  He just threw the mic down.  Was that new U2?  All right, we got to bring him in here because he can't hear us.  Oh, no.  What do we do with this milk?  Because it's going to sweat as soon as he comes in.  All right, get him in here.  Okay.  All right.  Set this up.  Over there.  Make sure he does not come anywhere in this direction.  Dude, you're pretty safe from him.  Dude, I don't want him staggering over here.  I don't want that either.  You got a cop that's with him. 
[02:58:30]  And Master Poe.  Wait, Master Poe, what's wrong?  Master Poe.  Wait, Master Poe, get a mic.  If he passes the Jägermeister machine, karate chop him.  Give me that microphone.  All right.  Don't touch the microphone.  Don't touch the microphone.  Give me time here.  Keep him over there.  All right.  What do you want to sing about?  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Master Poe is putting a bag over the microphone.  Ben, where's the Lysol?  I need it immediately.  Oh, my God. 
[02:59:00]  It stinks in here.  I need the Lysol immediately.  Oh, my God.  I need the Lysol immediately.  That was the real thing, man.  I'm talking about the real thing.  He's got his XM satellite radio hat on.  Now, where are you?  Here's some advertising.  Over here.  No, I need it over here.  Over here.  Now, there's straight time on the air.  Y'all, shut up.  He always doesn't have a goddamn spider.  I'm getting pissed off right now.  Y'all, shut your mouth. 
[02:59:30]  I'm going to sing a song.  Can you sing a holiday song?  What kind of one you sing?  All right.  You sing whatever you want.  That's a nice section.  Don't you like singing like Rod Stewart?  You want some Rod Stewart?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, you want my body.  He's telling the crowd to calm down.  Come on, baby.  Let me know.  All right.  No, no, no.  We'll do something else. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Let's do something else.  All right.  All right.  How bad we want to get?  How low are you going to get?  How down are you going to go?  Let's go as low as you can get.  Okay.  What I'm saying is this.  Tippi Tom is going to sing a song.  All right.  Let's go.  Hey.  We're going to get busy.  It's going to get right.  Now, I'm saying Tippi Tom is going to belt one out.  Uh-huh.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  Tippi Tom is going to belt a song out.  Now, it's your backup.  Come on.  Backup.  Come on.  We don't even know what you're singing.  Give us a clue.  All right.  This is your backup, man.  Now, Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  I'm going to belt one out.  The refrigerator box fine.  Now, what I'm saying is I want to sing a song.  All right.  Let's start the song.  All right.  All right.  Now, sing.  We understand. 
[03:01:00]  You want to sing.  Now, I'm trying to sing a song.  All right.  All right.  Then, sing.  It's like that Twilight Zone episode.  I want to belt one out.  I want to belt one out.  I want to belt one out.  And you give him the drink.  I want to sing a song.  Come on, Rummy.  I want to belt one out.  I want to sing a good song.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, you're going to get along.  We know you're going to sing.  Now, what I'm saying is that.  You're going to sing a song.  We know.  I'm going to get busy.  Oh, leave that on. 
[03:01:30]  We're singing a song.  And I'm.  Holy shit.  Will you sing your song?  All right.  You don't send me flowers anymore.  You don't send me flowers anymore.  I can't sing now. 
[03:02:00]  No.  I'm taking it out.  I'm taking it out right now.  I'm scared.  Yo, fuck me up, man.  No.  Where's he going?  Jimmy, Jimmy, relax.  I'm not ready.  I'm not ready.  He's crying.  Why is he crying?  Fuck me up.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Jimmy's time's a little unstable.  Holy Jesus.  Why'd someone give him a Jaeger?  Yeah, he mean.  Yeah, give him a shot of Jaeger.  I'm scared. 
[03:02:30]  I'm scared.  I'm scared, Tina.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  Jesus.  He really is Razzle Rizzo.  I'm falling apart here.  Just get him on a bus to Florida.  He'll be fine.  As he urinates.  He just took a rest stop and wasn't on the schedule.  Yeah, I'll be about worn out.  All right, Tom, you're back.  Oh, he's back.  All right.  You're back.  You haven't been farther away from me. 
[03:03:00]  I hate my space being invaded.  Oh, I know.  You got Keith in between you and Tibby, Tom.  I know, but he could be over there.  Go over there.  All right.  There's a whole half room over there.  My name's Tibby Tom.  He's not scared anymore.  You want some ass kick, you rock and roll?  Yeah, let's get some rock and roll.  You like your Jägermeister?  You like that Jägermeister better than that cheap crap you've been drinking.  That's good stuff.  You like the Jäger?  Yeah, you like the Jäger.  All right.  It's not my tune.  It's somebody else I know.  All right.  It's like Listerine for the homeless. 
[03:03:30]  Nasty for a white wedding.  Yeah.  Oh, a little Billy Idol.  Ah, fuck.  All right.  All right.  You got me.  All right.  I'll do one of my originals.  No, no.  Well, okay.  Original.  What's your Tibby Tom original?  It's an original.  Go ahead.  You're calling it Tibby Tom.  All right.  I have a Harry Stern show and that motherfucking jackass in my book.  All right.  And I'm serious. 
[03:04:00]  You're a jackass.  I tell a lie.  I have no thing to lie about.  Were you trying to get a radio?  Who?  Last week when you were down in Union Square.  Oh, yeah.  I was over there last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was over there.  What happened?  Fuck, man.  Motherfucking thing.  I heard there were a lot of homeless people on that line.  Tibby Tom.  Go ahead.  Go all over.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[03:04:30]  Sing another song.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no.  Don't.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  The lice is probably lying.  The lice are just trampolining out of his...  What are you talking about?  I ain't got no lice.  I ain't got no lice.  I ain't got no lice.  All right.  I thought maybe you might.  You're lying.  I ain't got no lice.  I thought you might.  You got lice.  Why would he say that?  You lie.  You lie.  Why would you say that?  He said it.  He said it.  He said it.  He said it.  I can't believe Anthony would say you had lice.  He said it.  He said it?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I ain't got no lice.  It's obvious you got lice.  Why would you say that, Steve?  He doesn't have lice. 
[03:05:00]  Master Poe, how quickly can you strike?  Excuse my language.  But I'm telling you this.  I ain't got no lice.  Yeah.  He shouldn't say that.  Yeah, but you do have the AIDS.  Yeah, I'm trying to sing a song.  He really does have the AIDS, by the way.  Remember?  Aw, that's a shame.  Let me sing a song.  All right, sing a song, Tippi.  He's a homeless gay guy, by the way.  You still gay, Tippi Tom?  Well, I was gay all my life.  All right.  No, I had no problem with that.  That's fine.  You got probably being gay?  No, he does.  No, no, he does. 
[03:05:30]  He does.  Everyone's playing.  No one's playing to the scene.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  Are you still getting action out there on the street?  I don't give a fuck.  I was drumming.  I don't give a crap.  Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  You still getting action on the street?  Behind the dumpsters and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  I got action on the street.  Yeah.  When was the last time you got a little action on the street?  What happened?  Tippi Tom would go out on the street.  I ain't gonna say these nasty words.  You can say whatever you want. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I got a blowjob last night.  What do you think of that?  Wow.  Yeah.  Who gave you a blowjob?  I saw a drag queen give me a blowjob.  And I'm thinking, hey, this feels good.  And I'm into it, man.  And I was groovy about it.  And now what I'm saying is this. 
[03:06:30]  The blowjob was really good.  Frank Slade.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I was happy.  Hey.  So what's wrong with being happy?  Well, you're happy.  Why don't you sing a song you're so happy?  All right.  Let me belt one out.  All right.  Every time we'll belt one out.  All right.  Okay. 
[03:07:00]  Softly.  I will leave you softly long before your arms can make me wait.  For one more hour.  Come on.  Who do that?  Or one more day.  Is he complaining if someone farted?  After all the years. 
[03:07:30]  It's perfect for Frank Slade.  Come on, guys.  You're fucking me up, man.  That song was awful.  You don't even know who fucking sang it.  Yeah.  What song is it?  You don't even know.  I know.  It was that guy who does those songs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'm right, though, right?  Yeah.  I can't bear the tears so softly as I leave you there.  As I leave you there. 
[03:08:00]  John F. Hanson?  Who sang this?  Who sang that?  Can you do some Frank Sinatra?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  About time.  It is about time.  You need another shot before you do Frank Sinatra?  Yeah, I'm fucking right.  It's about time.  It's about fucking right.  Get the hell out of here.  Where are we going?  Frank Sinatra.  Yeah, go.  Get out of here.  You're fucking right.  That's right.  Go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Give him a shot and blink at the microphone.  Yeah, calm down.  There's your medicine.  There you go.  Jesus. 
[03:08:30]  Don't get him too wasted, dude.  Too wasted before he walked in the door.  He got it.  Who got Frank Sinatra?  I want to hear some Frank Sinatra.  Sing some Frank Sinatra, maybe.  Yeah, I can really sing like that guy.  Okay.  I'll do a little Frank.  All right, Frank.  Pick up a note.  Frank's dead.  Frank smells just like you do.  Yeah, like I hang out with Frank Sinatra, right?  Yeah, right. 
[03:09:00]  Kicking me in my ass.  Okay.  You want more Frank Sinatra?  Let's get some Frank Sinatra going.  You like Tony Bennett?  Sing a little Tony Bennett.  Whatever you want to sing.  Frank Sinatra.  All right, here we go.  Whoa.  It almost fell over.  Let me get Tony Bennett going here.  All right.  You might not want to move the mic around.  That's okay.  It's moving it that way.  It's fine.  Willie Nelson?  Yes.  Willie Nelson.  I like Willie Nelson.  I do too. 
[03:09:30]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Look at him staring at him.  All right.  We're bonding.  Sing a song.  Sing a song, Tippi.  Let's go.  Bonding to his underwear.  All right, Tippi, time.  We're going to sing a song.  All right.  All right.  You ain't going to know this one.  It's going to be a little bit of a problem for all you guys.  You all grown up now.  I'm going back to when we were children. 
[03:10:00]  I never thought that life could be anything but catastrophe.  You ain't got it.  Suddenly, I just see a bit of good luck in me.  I met him.  You don't know it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:10:30]  Fuck you guys.  Yeah, shit.  Yeah, that stunk.  It's the wrong movie, man.  That was awful.  No, no, no.  Don't sit on that.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't sit here, Tippi.  This will break.  Yeah, that'll break.  All right.  It has nothing to do with the smell.  Trust me.  We just...  So you don't like...  I want you to leave the studio for a little while.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm singing right now.  He's singing.  Oh, he's singing? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Now, all right.  How big was the fellow that gave you...  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  Talk about my pretty lady.  And the lady is mine.  I like how he works the room, too.  Don't fall down, dude.  Yeah, you know what she's about.  Yeah.  Yeah, guys, they got that music, man.  I ain't Tom Jones. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, fuck, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Just get out of here.  Just get out of here.  Yeah, fuck, man.  Yeah, I was trying to get busy over here.  Tippi, you don't have to touch it anymore.  All right.  Why don't you take a break there, Tippi?  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, we're going to...  I'm going to go get Joey.  No!  I'm singing right now.  A couple minutes.  I got to take a break.  We'll come back in.  Come on. 
[03:12:00]  I got another shot for you outside.  Oh, fucker.  Yeah.  Oh, he's ready to throw.  He's ready to throw.  Oh, he's ready to throw.  He's lifting his hands up.  All right.  There he is.  Fuck out of here.  All right.  I'm singing, man.  Come on.  Here.  Come outside.  Yeah, shit.  Shut my mouth.  He's back outside.  You mother of fucker.  Yeah, yeah.  He has to...  That whole table area has to be washed down.  I want to...  I want to...  Did you see him...  Did you see him, like, put his hands up to Steve?  Yes.  Like you wanted to fight him, and then he looked at Steve, and that bit of sobriety  came through, and he said, I'd get killed if I'd swung at him. 
[03:12:30]  You mother of fucker.  I was sick.  I was trying to get busy.  Maybe he should have gotten busy years ago.  You get my ass.  I don't think he wanted to hit Steve as much as he wanted to warm his hands up around Steve's  shirt.  Oh, maybe that's what it was.  He thought it was a flaming barrel.  He wanted to stand around and sing with four other guys.  Everyone is now scrubbing down the studio. 
[03:13:00]  Was that sprayed with what, Paul?  Lysol is being sprayed on the console.  Keith is washing his hands with that soapless or waterless soap.  Yeah, give me some of that stuff, please.  Yeah, those all have to...  Oh, my God.  It's his Jaeger cups.  I want to know who drank out of his mule last night.  Oh, God.  Well, we'll ask him in the middle.  We'll ask him in the middle.  What kind of schlong?  I mean, what's that schlong covered in?  Some kind of fish-tasting peanut butter.  We could take a look at it.  I'll bet when you... 
[03:13:30]  I'll bet when you pull the foreskin back, it makes the same sound of fruit roll-up makes  when you peel it.  He actually brought a friend with him.  He's downstairs.  I didn't...  Oh, really?  We didn't have Poe clear him yet.  A friend?  Another?  Another homeless guy is hanging out downstairs.  Does he smell as bad?  Is he coming up?  Yeah, I guess we could bring him up.  Does he have any more sensibility than...  Yeah, yeah.  He's in a little better shape than Tippy Tom.  He might be able to have a little insight on him.  All right.  We'll just bring him up.  Years ago, Tippy Tom, we were just talking about this before, went into the hospital because 
[03:14:00]  he...  I guess he broke something.  I don't remember the story, but he ended up in the hospital.  He ended up in the hospital where they took him off the sauce.  Remember they shaved him?  Yeah.  They shaved his face and brushed his hair and everything.  And we had him on the air, and he was completely normal.  He was completely normal.  Like any guy you'd see walking down the street.  Right.  Carrying on a regular conversation, saying, yeah, when I drink, you know, I get like this. 
[03:14:30]  And then to see, like, what happens, it's just a mess.  Mic him.  Why aren't you guys micing him?  He turned it down.  Oh, don't turn him down.  Dude, when he took his hat off...  I'm not a friend that can sing.  Yeah.  When he took his hat off, it looked like somebody poured, like, a box of Uncle Ben's rice on  his hat.  Oh, God.  I saw the lights just bounce again.  I'm all itchy.  I don't know, man.  I'm itchy now.  I don't need that.  I blew it, man.  All right.  He's out there trying to calm down. 
[03:15:00]  I want decontamination somehow.  I'm unhappy.  It just stinks.  Listen to him.  It's just going on.  Timmy Tom, fuck up.  Timmy Tom, fuck up.  Yeah.  I'll put on stage.  I'm just mesmerized by this guy.  I fucked up.  I blew it, man. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, what's happening?  This is Zach Wild.  I'm the Ozzy Osbourne Band of Black Label Society.  And we're all doing a hang with open Anthony.  Oh, for the love of God.  That sex change operation you guys advised, you call this a labia?  I swear to Christ, you scumbags, I will get you back.  Tim 202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Are you guys ready to wake up tippy, Tom?  Where's the broads?  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Ben, what's going on?  Nothing works the right way on this show.  Stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads? 
[03:16:00]  Broad.  I was just going to sleep for a while.  Where's Keith?  Where's the holes with feet?  We have to make sure we do this right.  We got tippy Tom outside the studio.  Wiggle those stems in here, dame.  No, Keith, come in here.  Hold on.  Keith!  Keith.  Hold on.  Keith.  Holy shit, these fucking guys that work for us.  Sometimes they're just asleep.  Those silly geese.  Jesus.  What?  So how are you going to wake him up? 
[03:16:30]  We want to set this thing up here.  You got your gloves on?  Yeah, we'll give him a little stir and see.  Hopefully he hasn't pissed himself.  And you were telling us a little while ago that he gets really nasty when you wake him up?  Oh, yeah, he's nasty when you wake him up.  He's real nasty.  Eric is covering his nose with his shirt.  Right.  I guess it really stinks out there.  All right, we got Steve, who's filming all this for some videos that we'll get up on  opieandanthony.com later today.  All right.  It's waking up a belligerent homeless guy.  Keep that over there, the microphone.  He's sitting on my side of the console. 
[03:17:00]  Make sure that mic is up.  Make sure the mic works.  Test the mic.  Test the mic.  Oh, my God.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic.  The mic's on.  Okay, good.  How can they hear us?  No, but do you have headphones on so you can hear us?  No.  No, of course not.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him up.  Tippy Tom.  It's Tommy.  Uh-oh.  He might be dead.  No, he's not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse.  Is he dead?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  Oh, my.  We could have a problem.  Tippy Tom.  Smack him in the head.  All right.  His ears are kind of red.  No, I think he's alive.  They can't wake him, though.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[03:18:00]  He...  He...  Does he have a pulse?  Oh, my God.  He's not waking up.  No, don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  Just smack him in the fire.  Do you like to try, Mr. Poe?  He's dead.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  You guys really need headphones out there if we're going to try to do a radio show.  Because you don't know what we're saying.  Oh, I hope we didn't kill the homeless guy.  Does he have a pulse?  I think it's a very, very faint pulse. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Is he waking?  Steve's got to move a little.  Steve.  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  Master Poe.  Get a mic on Master Poe.  You know, he's got to be a deep sleeper.  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's got to be a deep sleeper if he's a homeless guy.  You've got to sleep through a lot. 
[03:19:00]  Master Poe, what do you think?  Is he alive?  Yeah, he's alive.  If I give him a couple of pressure points, he may wake up.  But I don't want him to go to the bathroom on the floor.  Oh, yeah.  He is breathing.  Hold the mirror up in front of his mouth.  Yeah, he's breathing.  He's breathing, and he does have a pulse.  Oh, okay.  That's all you need.  If, um...  All right, let's give him...  Oh, Steve's going to, like...  Steve's touching with those ones.  What's he's... 
[03:19:30]  No, Steve's trying to snap...  Tippy Tom!  Oh, my God.  We can't...  We cannot wake Tippy Tom.  Really, really yell at him.  Not in his ear where it'll damage anything, but, like, get right up to him and just yell,  Tom, wake up.  You know, just wake up.  There's another way to wake him up.  Tippy Tom!  Wake up, Tippy Tom!  Okay, that's not going to work.  Wow.  Somebody yell...  Come on, Tippy!  Get up, boy!  Don't say...  Boy.  I like the red-headed lady out there who just can't believe this is happening in the studio.  Oh, no. 
[03:20:00]  She's disgusted.  Dude, he's not moving at all.  All right.  Holy S.  How are we going to get him out of here?  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's Place studio.  All right.  What's going on out there?  Someone's got to tell us what's going on out there.  They're pouring water over his ear a little bit?  A little water.  Steve, get out of the way!  There we go.  Turn your head.  I know you've got to film it, but I don't want to see. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  Keith, I need you.  What you've got to do is put your fingers in the water and then flick it onto his face.  I'll do it?  Please tell me the homeless guy's not dead.  I think he's dead.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kind of...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you...  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  Tippi Tom!  What's Poe doing?  Poe is brilliant.  He's...  Yeah, we got some fun.  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God! 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  He can knock you out.  Tippi Tom, you ready to do a little more singing?  Gotta wake up, Tippi.  You ready?  Oh, my...  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  I thought he was dead, too.  Just a little water in the air.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head, like, oh, my God, the news, we're fired.  Wow.  Are you starting to wake up?  Come on, you have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  All right, well, you're up now.  Now, you know why?  Some people want to hear you say it.  Water on the eardrop? 
[03:21:30]  I'm not saying it.  Frank Sinatra together.  I suck.  All right, I need my 15-minute rest.  You were resting for God's.  15 minutes?  It's my business.  Not yours.  No, no, I know, Tippi, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's alive.  Thank.  Come on, Tippi.  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Get the fuck out there and work and come back.  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Here, Tippi Tom, drink this.  No. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, God.  He's saying no to a drink.  Wow.  He doesn't even want to drink.  No, I want rest now.  Be my friend and give me my 15, 20 minutes.  All right, we'll give him 15 or 20 minutes.  No?  Yes, we should go make him sleep by that lady's desk, though.  Oh, God, no.  Right on the floor by her feet.  Tippi?  Stinking up the place.  Yo, Tippi.  Come on, Tippi.  We have to wake up.  Not now.  I said 20 or 15 minutes.  I'm going to tell you about my boss. 
[03:22:30]  He's going to be coming in about 15 minutes.  Just get the fuck out of here.  Give him 15 minutes.  I don't sleep 15 more minutes if you want.  I don't...  I'm giving my 20 minutes.  Now that we know how to wake him up, wake him up.  Yeah.  He is seconds away from getting really nasty.  Yeah, no, you were sleeping for two hours.  We need you inside, Tippi.  Go ahead.  Get out of here before.  I fucked up.  I told you.  I'm mad.  I told you.  I told you.  I'll bust somebody's head open, motherfucker. 
[03:23:00]  Get out of here.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  What's up, pal?  I already know you.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what I mean, though?  You've been going to have a long time.  A good friend.  Fuck you.  Give me my rest, man.  You want coffee?  No.  I'll leave.  That's what will happen.  And you want to see me.  Give me my 15, 20 minutes and get the fuck out of here.  Come on, pal.  We're going to go inside.  We're going to sing.  No. 
[03:23:30]  I don't want to wake up now.  You're fucking with me.  Go get lost.  There's this guy here.  He wants to suck your cock.  I ask him.  I don't care.  Nice blowjob.  Get you going good in the morning.  Come on, pal.  Maybe 15, 20 minutes, please.  Right, man.  Fuck you, man.  They took his head off.  They took my 15 fucking minutes, you son of a bitch.  You dumbass mother fucker. 
[03:24:00]  He's walking around now.  He's fucking sucked my dick.  Eat my asshole shit.  He's walking out.  Look at the face on her out there.  Look at that mug.  Do we want to keep him or do we want to let him?  Keep him.  Tell Steve to film her.  He's just wandering around the office and horrifying everyone else that works here.  See the mug on her.  Oh, I know.  Very angry.  She's not happy. 
[03:24:30]  That's right.  Eat my asshole, he said.  Oof.  Jesus.  It's quite a meal.  You know, I'm telling you, a thick, viscous meal.  We don't, we tell the truth on this show as much as we possibly can.  I swear, my heart sank.  I really thought he was dead.  I thought he was dead, too.  Because they were raising his arms and his head and there was no.  He was not moving.  There was nothing.  And he kind of had a.  Falling purple hue to him.  What's up, Ben?  No, Eric's on the phone with their, they're just, they're talking to his 12 there. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, okay.  Is he near the elevator?  Yeah, no, he's by the main door.  All right, Eric, what's going on?  We ran out of microphone cord, but he's heading back, so we're going to throw him back on the mic.  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Keep away from my side.  All right, he's alive.  And he's awake.  He's coming in the studio.  He's got his fizzes up.  Hey, come on in here, Tippi.  Bad ass chicken you want.  What's up?  Tippi, what's going on out there?  Don't break me up.  I'm trying to get a little knack.  We need you inside, Tippi. 
[03:25:30]  But you're here to perform, no?  I bust his ass.  I thought you wanted to sing another song.  You want to fight?  Yeah, I'll fight you.  We're going to fight.  Opie's getting up.  I'm not fighting him.  What a bro's dope you want.  You want a bruised nose?  One of those gritty knuckles in your face.  Not even, he'll just lick your mouth and nose.  End of fight.  All right, Tippi Tom, let's work this out.  What happened?  You're going to get your ass beat.  What happened?  What happened out there?  Here's what's happening that's going on.  I have no idea what happened to you. 
[03:26:00]  What's going on?  You're a deep sleeper, by the way.  I'm trying to get a little nap.  Okay.  Because, you know, I'm a little sleepy.  A little tired from all the work that you do.  Tippi Tom, a little sleepy, you know what I'm saying?  And so I try to take a little nap.  And these motherfuckers over here give me a hard time.  Right.  So what I got to do, I don't, it's not I don't love them, but what I'm saying is that I want  to take my nap.  But you were napping for about two hours. 
[03:26:30]  No.  Yeah, you were.  We watched you sleeping.  It was two hours.  It wasn't two hours.  You're lying.  It wasn't two hours.  I don't lie.  I don't know for about half an hour.  It was two hours, Tippi Tom.  Well, Tippi Tom, he's unhappy.  And something I'm saying is this, is that I'm going to bust somebody's nose.  All right.  Bust his nose. 
[03:27:00]  That guy is the problem right there.  I'm trying to get another half hour in.  Yeah.  Can we get a song before you go back to sleep?  Can we get another song before you go back to sleep?  A little lullaby, maybe.  Sing me a lullaby, please.  If I do one, I would.  Yes, you do.  Come on.  The one you always sing.  Which one?  You always sing your lullaby?  Yeah.  Sing the lullaby.  All right.  Radio station, right?  Yeah.  Right on. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Fairytales can come true.  It can happen to you.  Obviously.  If you're young at heart.  No, let me take a nap.  That's all you get.  That's all we get.  Hey, we want to hear about the drag queen from last night.  It's hard to find the matter, the matter, if you're young at heart. 
[03:28:00]  But if you should survive.  To 102 or 3?  Something like that.  Yeah.  If you are amongst the young at heart, give me the variety of that.  All right.  No, I can't do it like him.  All right.  Can we, we want to know about the drag queen?  Let's talk about it.  We want to know about the drag queen last night.  The drag queens?  All right.  No, no. 
[03:28:30]  This drag queen.  You got a BJ from a drag queen, right?  Over on 14th Street, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  She come over to me, right?  Mm-hmm.  She says, hey, good looking.  What's cooking?  What the fuck are you talking about?  My underwear.  She thought I was good looking.  Making stew.  And Timmy Thompson said, wait a second now.  I know you're good looking.  And I know you're good looking, too.  So what are we going to do about that? 
[03:29:00]  He's going to use Jay Moore's line.  Right.  Yeah.  So we got...  Did you pull your pants down?  So we got two good looking people together.  And the drag queen.  And I'm going to...  Yeah.  Looked pretty damn good yourself.  And so I got busy.  Where'd you go?  Behind the dumpster? 
[03:29:30]  Well, we were going to do it behind the dumpster.  I didn't know.  You're a little more romantic than that.  Let's do it right on the sidewalk, man.  We're going to get busy.  So you pulled out your hog?  And we make money.  Sounds like George Carlin, doesn't he?  Damn fucking right.  Bullshit.  Nobody behind the dumpster.  So what happened?  You pulled out your hog?  I'm not no cheap fuck.  I'm serious.  We are going to get busy. 
[03:30:00]  Right there.  Motherfuckers.  And then what happened was this.  We did our thing.  And I ain't going to go into details.  You pulled out the old him squirt gun?  Can we see your stuff?  No, no, no.  Opie, don't even joke.  I'm on the radio now.  Can we see your stuff?  Shut up.  You guys shut up.  Yeah, let's see it. 
[03:30:30]  I'm trying to explain myself.  After we got busy, I gave her a buck.  You gave her a buck?  Oh, a buck.  All right.  Lots of money.  She want to get on a train.  But she need a buck fifty.  I said, all right.  I'll get you more fifty cents. 
[03:31:00]  So where'd you get her fifty cents from?  So I bought her fifty cents from my buddy.  He gave me fifty cents.  So I get her on the train.  And we done gone fuckin' over there.  And so make sure she go home.  She said, hey, Timmy time, why don't you come back to my house?  Oh.  I said, yeah.  I'll meet you later on. 
[03:31:30]  And these motherfuckers rubbed me up over here.  And so I'm all fucked up.  So I got her on the train.  I bumped fifty cents from my buddy.  Give her my dollar.  And she's gonna go uptown.  And that's what happened.  All right.  So the buck happened.  And with that, why don't you...  So he's got one clean spot on his body.  All I got out of this whole fuckin' deal was a fuckin' blowjob.  All right.  And that was...  How about one more song and then you could go nap? 
[03:32:00]  I can get the fuck out of here.  One more song and then you could go nap.  Yeah, think of some.  And then we'll wake you up for the grand finale at the end of the show.  Yeah.  One more song.  All right.  You want to do a song and belt one out?  Yeah, let's all belt one out.  Here we go.  I like the dance moves.  Please snap this one.  All right.  Stand back.  Everybody stand back.  All right.  Stand back.  Clear the field.  Some bums are gonna do something singing.  Is it rock or roll or something a little different?  I think we're enjoying the love songs or the nursery rhyme type things. 
[03:32:30]  Love songs.  Something tender.  Something tender.  Sure.  All right.  A little tender.  Yeah.  I left my heart in San Francisco.  Right next to the soap.  High on hill, it calls to me, little cable cars. 
[03:33:00]  Ah, fuck.  I can't perform now.  No.  You know I get no song.  No way.  He's not quinkly, doesn't he?  Temperamental, little fella.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Get from me.  He's like Sinatra.  All right.  He's leaving.  He's leaving.  Please make him talk to other people in the office.  Please.  My voice is fucked up.  She's a miserable out there.  All right.  I'll sing a song about a little while.  All right.  A little while he's gonna sing and take a nap. 
[03:33:30]  There he goes.  Just my ass.  Tippi Tom doesn't want to talk, Anthony.  Give me a fucking horse.  Give me a what?  Who am I talking to?  Fucking horse.  All right.  Look.  I'll tell you right now.  He's outside the studio.  Tippi Tom.  On mic.  Yes.  Don't feel good.  I got tummy upset.  And so what I'm saying is that.  If he blows a fart, it's over, Johnny.  Because I love you.  And be well.  All right.  I will bust your ass if you give me a hard time. 
[03:34:00]  But I love you.  And I ain't gonna break up.  Make him go to sleep.  The thing is is.  Go to sleep.  I love you.  I love you too.  Go to sleep.  I need a nap.  All right.  And I'll come back and visit.  All right.  All right.  Take a nap.  Please.  Good night.  About five minutes.  And I'll come back.  All right.  We'll get Tippi Tom back in here in a little while.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Yes, Jerry.  Hi.  I'm imagining his hot, stinky alcohol breath in my face. 
[03:34:30]  And I'm gagging over here.  I know.  He just woke up.  He was sleeping.  And then his morning breath.  Oh, yeah.  The videos will be up on opiananthony.com.  And I smell a promo.  Tippi Tom sings.  You got sweepers.  The love ballads.  Tippi Tom sings.  The love ballads.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I have a question from Master Paul.  What did you do to drop me?  You can't, outside the studio, no one can wake him up, and you just dripped a little 
[03:35:00]  bit of water on his ear, and he was up.  Yes.  Water was nice and cold, and it went down his ear and just woke him up.  Just like that.  All the slapping and hitting him with the microphone did nothing but a drop of water in his ear.  One drop of water.  One drop of cold water right in his ear canal, right?  Exactly.  Went down his eardrum.  That wakes you up.  That'll wake you up.  All right.  I think my brother's on to something here.  He just handed me a note.  Have a homeless American Idol contest.  Ooh.  Imagine getting, is there any other guys out there that sing? 
[03:35:30]  Tippi Tom that sings like, well, Ziggy used to, but Ziggy's dead.  Yeah, Ziggy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  It's not a bad idea.  It's a great idea.  Ziggy's dead, baby.  Ziggy's dead.  We could give this to Keith.  Keith, you want to run with this?  Ziggy.  Keith could be the Simon Cow of this bit.  I think I could think of a couple of other singing homeless that we can come up with.  Singing homeless?  Sure.  Oh, my God.  They're spraying them down right now.  Yeah, they are.  All right.  Why don't we step aside, take a break?  Is there anything you want to hear going into break? 
[03:36:00]  This is a great smoothie.  I'll say it is.  Again.  It's banana.  It's orange.  You don't know what to make of it.  It's fantastic.  But it all falls under the subheading of yummy.  You guys want to hear anything going into break?  No.  Nothing I can think of.  Nothing pops in your head?  Whatever you want, Ope.  Nothing aside from that foul stench that's popping in my head.  Exactly.  It's just awful.  All right.  We'll just do this then.  I really do want to see his mule, though.  Hey, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt, and you're listening to the worst, and I do mean the worst, of Opie 
[03:36:30]  and Anthony.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Everything you say to me.  What's that comes to the day?  And I'm on the break.  I need a little room to break.  You're my wife.  Sex Vagal, where are you?  I'm in the bathroom down the hall here, and Tippi Tom is going pee-pee, as he's saying.  All right.  Tippi Tom is going pee-pee.  Here we go.  He's in the bathroom. 
[03:37:00]  How's it going in there, Tom?  Everything is good.  You know what's great?  It's just about nine o'clock, so all the people that work on the hall are going to be getting  in.  I'm working on it.  Give me about another minute.  Sex Vagal.  I don't know if you can come in there with it.  Well, of course you can.  You don't want to tell me that.  Let me get through this first. 
[03:37:30]  What are you going to do to him if he comes in there?  Well, I don't know.  What are you going to do?  I think you're going to get it sick, Tom.  All right.  Jesus.  Jesus, man.  All right.  Well, so they're in the bathroom.  You can't really understand that.  Rhino from Massachusetts.  Yeah.  Well, BJ for $1.50.  Wake him up and ask him where I can find this drag queen.  That's a bargain at any price.  I'll say it is.  That's got to be just awful.  Yeah.  Steve saw his underwear. 
[03:38:00]  He said it's green.  Oh, God.  Steve saw his underwear?  Did he tape it?  Yeah.  He's still in there.  He's excited.  You know, it's a clean bathroom.  Oh, my God.  He's a wreck in the bathroom.  Oh, we got an update on Tippi Tom in the bathroom.  Hold on, Jim.  From Keith the cop.  I got to draw a line.  What?  He fell asleep taking a shit.  And I am not going in the stall to get him out.  No, you're kidding.  He's dead asleep.  He's got his head between his legs, and he's dead asleep on the ball.  On the toilet.  Yeah.  And that's it.  Wow.  I'm done.  What are you doing now? 
[03:38:30]  I'm not doing anything.  I'm done.  He's staying.  No one's going to want to go in there to get him out.  Especially because he's not going to wipe.  Is he going to wipe?  No.  No, he's not going to wipe.  Tippi Tom's a wipe?  Oh, dude, he's got a wipe.  Let me sing a little song.  Keith, could you wipe Tippi Tom's asshole?  He was telling a story about licking some guy's ass.  And he shot a load on the guy's face, and then he sucked it out of his eyeball. 
[03:39:00]  He's telling that story.  He's telling the story, and he fell asleep.  God damn it.  He didn't even get to the end of it.  Now I'll never know what happened.  He said, I was under the porch, and, oh, this is bad.  How are we going to get him out of there?  I don't know.  No one's going to want to go in there and wake him up.  Not our problem.  No.  Hey, by 10 o'clock, we're out of here anyway.  We should just leave him there for the day.  Bye-bye.  Just leave him.  He'll find his way out. 
[03:39:30]  Wow.  Is he really asleep?  He is.  Passed out.  Ben, you saw him.  Did Steve get video?  Steve's got video, and the best part of it is he's wearing Opie's underwear,  because there's this big brown shit thing.  This is the shoe shine rag.  He's got the shoe shine rag.  That was only when I had the flu.  And Steve got video of his underwear.  He got video of everything.  It is great.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I'm just dying for the first guy from down the hall to go in there,  you know, to see the whole mess in the bathroom. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, fuck it.  Sorry, sir.  Excuse me.  Yeah, can you see him over there?  Pardon me.  I need some toilet paper.  Hey, why don't you go fuck yourself?  Steve, what's going on?  Tom, is that you?  Do you have the video?  We'll load your eyes.  Yeah, I got video.  He's passed out with his head between his legs and his face in his green soupy underwear.  It's awesome. 
[03:40:30]  How do you do it?  All right, bring that over.  How do you do a regular show after hearing something like that?  I know.  How do you?  It's hard to talk with an erection.  That is hard.  Let's see the...  I'm going to check out a quick video clip.  Yeah, of course.  I'm going to see Tom in the toilet.  This is disgusting.  It really is.  All right, Steve is...  There we go.  Here, put the mic down near the audio. 
[03:41:00]  Wait, go back.  I want to hear the story.  Oh, wait, sorry.  He's talking about...  Where's the speaker?  Yeah.  All right, what are you looking at there?  God, the camera smells.  It does smell.  This shot would come in his eye.  That was a flick of my ass off.  Yeah, damn.  Yeah, I'm sorry about this, man.  You got to tell this story on the radio.  Oh, he's blowing his nose into his hand. 
[03:41:30]  You can tell that story.  Dude, his underwear are green.  They are green.  You're a liar.  They're green in the front and gray all around.  I haven't seen the part where his ass would be in him.  But he is sitting on the ball, taking a dump,  blowing his nose into his hand and telling horrid stories  until he drifts off to sleep.  I have this toilet paper there.  Why would he use his hand?  What's wrong with you?  There is definitely, because I know I saw Steve pull the camera back 
[03:42:00]  because he was disgusted.  There is a shot of Tippi Tom's cock on that tape.  Oh, God, no.  Absolutely, absolutely.  Can you see it?  It was horrifying.  This is really bad because I think there was a piece of corn  stuck on the tip of it.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  It looks like there's a dead guy in there because you just see his feet hanging out.  It's a weekend at Bernie's in our bathroom.  Yeah, totally.  I'll give somebody $1,000 if they wear those underwear over their face. 
[03:42:30]  That ain't worth it.  We got some people raising their hands in there.  Yeah.  I should have made it a lower offer.  He's ready to go.  Danny would do it in a second.  And I would.  Lower the price.  He'll do it for $100.  I'd do it for $50.  You would do that for $1,000.  Dude, I need cash.  I never got paid on that shirt.  You don't understand.  You could go out and suck cock and make that much money.  You sure can, Danny.  If you're willing to put those underwear over your head, that's probably right in the same 
[03:43:00]  ballpark.  $1,000 is $1,000, man.  Oh, he said $50 now.  Yeah, $50.  I didn't expect anyone's hand to go up.  Shit, his hand went up really fast.  Jesus.  Steve's giving you another clip there, Anthony.  Does a grant have that much money to do that to?  Look at him.  He needs the money.  We got to buy those underwear.  What?  Ah!  Wait, don't tell me what it was. 
[03:43:30]  I want to see it now.  I got to walk this off.  Let's see the reaction.  I wanted to see this.  Would you wear them over your face?  Don't say it.  Put your face in there and breathe.  Stop it.  I'd love to have that.  All right.  What are we looking at?  Oh, God.  Okay.  All right, I'm looking.  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, God, no.  Oh, my God! 
[03:44:00]  Dude.  What the hell is...  What is going on?  What, the inside of the underwear?  Yeah.  Dude, I can...  Wow!  Look at...  Did you see?  Yeah, I saw.  Show Jimmy.  The inside of his underwear.  He's got a perfect shot of it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I got the heebie-jeebies.  I can handle stuff, but that is a little too much.  I know Jimmy's going to go, mmm, yum, yum.  Oh, it's just awful.  You see that?  It's green.  That's not a stain. 
[03:44:30]  That is...  And black.  That's not a stain.  He took a dump in his pants.  Of course he did.  Oh, my God.  But when?  Oh, my God.  That's not a fresh dump.  That's been bacon.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to...  It's been bacon.  Opie, Opie, I'll give you whatever you want to wear them over your face for three minutes.  Oh, dude.  I can't...  I can't function.  I am so disgusted.  I want you two pony up.  It's kind of cute.  I can handle stuff for the most part.  Oh, my God.  I'm just...  I know.  I keep getting the heebie-jeebies. 
[03:45:00]  The stench coming off of those balls.  He actually...  He woke up a little bit.  He's like,  Dippy Tom taking poo-poo.  That's what he told Poe.  Oh, you can see his mule.  Dippy Tom taking poo-poo.  All right.  Well, at least he's...  You know...  Can I think of the word that means you speak well?  Fucking non-improving idiot.  Yes.  He's...  I almost said literate.  All right.  Well, we should talk about other stuff, I guess.  All right.  We'll try to get to...  We'll try to get him in for the grand finale of the show.  Where's the chicks?  Let's talk about that.  I don't know where the chicks are.  Yeah, where are the girls? 
[03:45:30]  They got apparently stuck in accidents.  They're in traffic on the LIE.  So they're in the city about five blocks away right now.  All right.  Well, they'll be here soon.  It's only a little after.  Well, they're going to have to be well organized because they're not going to have much time.  Oh, God.  Could you guys tell we're one day away from a quick vacation?  No, the LIE can't control that.  Can you tell?  Yeah.  We're so, like, just all over the ball field today.  I'm disgusted.  Why?  That was...  I saw it on video, and I'm disgusted.  I can't imagine being in the same stall shooting that video. 
[03:46:00]  For 50 bucks, would you just lower your nose by the middle of those underwear and breathe?  I don't need to touch them.  Just smell.  There is no amount of money.  No amount of money.  A billion?  You could...  A billion dollars?  No.  Come on.  I have enough.  I have enough cash.  I'm fine.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  You'd do that for a million.  That is...  Dude, I'm getting...  I know.  I'm getting dry meat.  How much should we give Danny to wear him on his face?  Oh, God.  Negotiate.  Whoever wants to do it.  How much?  Negotiate.  Let's see.  How much?  I'm not giving a thousand dollars, but... 
[03:46:30]  We all chip in?  How much?  Would you chip in?  How much would you actually take?  What's the minimum you would take?  What happened to a grand?  That's...  We're just joking with us.  Well, you jumped on a grand.  We're wondering how low you would go.  A thousand.  That's too much.  Oh, man.  How low would you go?  It's got to be at least 500.  So you'd cut it in half.  Five beans.  At least.  Jimmy's thinking about it.  Would you take four?  I saw what it looks like.  It's not pretty.  It's cash, bro. 
[03:47:00]  It's cash.  How about 450?  I'm thinking 150 from each of us.  Oh, you are?  Oh, yeah.  Now, that would entail taking the underwear off of him and putting it over your head.  I've got to take them off, too.  Well, someone will cut them off.  Just pay them for them.  And then put...  Put...  The shit stains.  It's got to be right on your nose.  I've got a better idea.  What?  We should just put it on eBay.  No, you're not allowed to sell hazardous waste. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  I think I can get sick from that.  I am getting sick just thinking about it.  Teddy gets really sick.  You have to put the shit on your nose.  You know what, Anthony?  The guy's got the hiv.  Of course he gets sick.  What, Ben?  He needs help getting up.  He can't get up.  So someone's going to have to help.  I want the entire time to try.  All right.  Who fucked up my coffee the other day?  Oh.  All right.  Why don't we get some cell phones in there?  The cell phone is kind of crappy. 
[03:48:00]  Want to try another one?  Yeah.  Maybe someone else has a better one?  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in Tom's pants?  You know what?  I look...  I look...  Brownie?  I look closely at that brownie, by the way, Anthony, and I thought I saw the image of  Jesus in there.  We can make some good money off his underwear.  Tom has...  Become a shrine.  He has Puxitron he's fell in his underwear.  Oh.  That really is foul.  Looks like a big ladle of Dinty Moore fell in his underwear.  Where the hell do you do a show after seeing that underwear?  Oh, it's horrific. 
[03:48:30]  It was just sitting there.  Horrific.  Mocking everyone.  George from D.C. saying, I'm going to give two grand just to throw the underwear out and  stop talking about it.  All right.  How much to put them over the head of the red...  Like, the redhead?  Hello.  Tom, you okay?  All right.  We're back in the bathroom with Tippy Tom.  Okay.  Tom, you okay?  Ben, what's going on?  He's just...  Hey.  He's sitting there.  He can't...  You know, he's...  He really...  Tom. 
[03:49:00]  They're trying to wake him now?  No, he's awake.  He's just stuck in the toilet.  I'm going to have you in the bathroom with him.  Tom, come on.  Wake up.  He was awake a minute ago.  Can we get him out of the building before he dies?  That's all I care about.  Yeah.  He's not moving, man.  We will be so screwed if we get a...  We have a homeless guy die in our show.  He's not moving.  Keith's going to kick the door open.  Keith's going to kick the door open, I think, is what I heard.  Oh, boy.  Keith's going to kick the door open. 
[03:49:30]  Hold on.  You ready?  Yep.  All right.  Here we go.  Go.  Go.  He kicked the door open.  Is he awake now?  Oh, my God.  I'm in the stall.  Oh.  Stupid Ben.  You hear him cackling.  I hear Ben cackling.  Let me see if I can get both phones working here.  Hello?  Tom, come on.  Wake up, Tom.  Oh, okay. 
[03:50:00]  We got the two phones on the scene.  It's like stereo.  Tom, are you up?  I'm trying to poo-poo.  Ben, did he wake up?  Oh, he said he's trying to poo-poo.  Oh, my smell really bad, right?  You getting up soon?  Let's go.  We got to go back inside.  Where's he going?  You don't understand why I am.  Going to go back inside?  Five minutes.  The girls are coming.  Thank you, bro.  They want to see you.  I just go with my poo-poo.  You going to put your cock in for the girl? 
[03:50:30]  All right.  He's going poo-poo, he's saying.  I'm going poo-poo.  Jimmy, did you check it out?  Oh, yeah.  I actually said the whiz.  It's awful.  I couldn't look in there because the smell is just horrendous.  Is it really bad?  It's awful.  I hope you guys don't have to use the bathroom the rest of the day here.  No, no.  I won't go.  I won't ever go in there again.  No, it's all right.  The window's open.  Thank God you actually opened the window.  Eric?  All right.  You finish poo-poo.  We'll come back and get you.  All right.  They're going to let him.  He's dropping logs. 
[03:51:00]  All right.  He's dropping logs.  They're probably not even logs.  They're probably just like thick half meatballs.  You know what I mean?  No, I don't want to know what you mean.  Like a sock full of mud.  That's what it sounds like.  All right.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A.  Ass fuck.  Hi. 
[03:51:30]  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, I, I.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Opie and Anthony show. </pre>
