<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious reaction to a not-guilty verdict in a child sex abuse case.  The hosts, along with a caller, read aloud the verdict, expressing disbelief and anger, speculating on the jury's motivations and appearance, and even joking about their newfound celebrity status.  The discussion then pivoted to Michael Jackson's acquittal on similar charges, prompting a cynical commentary from a caller, Black Earl, on the verdict's implications for the African American community and Jackson's career.  The conversation broadened to include other controversial cases, such as the Fatty Arbuckle case, with detailed (and possibly inaccurate) retellings.  Another caller, Chuck Farnham, phoned in live from near Neverland Ranch, describing the scene outside, including a topless woman handing out donuts, and mentioning the possibility of obtaining newspapers from the Jackson trial location.  Comedic relief came from a caller named Evro from Alaska, who provided exaggerated tales of Alaskan life, sparking a humorous exchange with the hosts about the state's weather, wildlife, and culture.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Jim Norton’s recent *Tonight Show* appearance and a brief in-studio appearance by Dallas Cowboys player Tyson Walter.

The show then extensively covered Jim Norton's *Tonight Show* appearance.  A phone call with Norton himself detailed his jokes (including those about Hillary Duff), nervousness, experiences obtaining celebrity autographs, and an awkward encounter with Ozzy Osbourne.  The hosts, callers, and Norton discussed his performance, particularly his "couch time" segment.  The conversation took a crude turn, focusing on Norton's dating life and social awkwardness with women.  Rich Vos, filling in for Norton, joined the discussion, sharing anecdotes about a bad massage, his own dating struggles, and a humorous, explicit account of a shared youthful experience masturbating with friends.  This segment also touched on the bizarre reactions to Mayor Bloomberg's Puerto Rican Day proclamation and included various tangents, listener calls, speculation about Hillary Duff's possible drug use, further anecdotes involving Vos and his fiancée Bonnie, and a brief mention of Vos’s potential bleeding ulcer.

A subsequent segment heavily featured listener calls recounting childhood experiences of group masturbation, exploring various settings and the attempts to avoid eye contact.  Callers debated whether these acts constituted "gay" behavior, sharing detailed and often explicit stories involving various methods and “contests.”  These accounts included using unusual objects for masturbation and stories of sexual encounters and experiences, some involving oral sex and a lampshade.  Callers included Carl, Frank, Eric, Tyrod, Brad, Jason, Jeff, Nick, Rob, Darren, and George.  Bonnie and Rich were in studio, joined later by Otto and George (a ventriloquist act) who promoted their DVD. Tyson Walter made another brief appearance. The segment included clips from the hosts' previous Bravo appearance and revisited the Michael Jackson trial and the actions of Dove Lady, a woman protesting the verdict.

The show continued with further discussion of the Michael Jackson child molestation trial.  The hosts and guests debated the lack of evidence, public reaction (including Reverend Al Sharpton's comments), Jackson's behavior, and the accuser's mother's motivations.  The conversation included personal anecdotes from Opie (about his childhood drug use and walking toward gunfire while high on crack), Otto (about a bizarre incident involving a can of beans), and Rich Voss (about a disastrous eBay Rolls Royce purchase involving sauerkraut). Celebrity gossip included discussions of Jackson's alleged behavior, Tommy Mottola and Mariah Carey, the culture of celebrity in Los Angeles, and Robert Blake's murder trial.  The show also included critiques of other comedians and a phone call from a listener challenging the hosts’ frequent negative comments about female comedians; Bonnie McFarlane, present in the studio, participated in this conversation.  The segment was punctuated by frequent profanity, vulgar jokes, and offensive language. Bonnie McFarlane, Rich Voss, Otto, and George were in studio during this segment.

The final segment focused on a Lifetime channel segment featuring a grandmother giving sex advice, with the hosts reacting to clips showing her advice on improving semen taste and bondage. A caller discussed his girlfriend’s interest in bondage, expressing his anxieties. The conversation included graphic descriptions and crude humor related to sexual acts.  A brief discussion about a previous show's interrupted phone call involving Paris Hilton and a musician from Corrosion of Conformity was also included.  The segment concluded with promotion of Otto and George's upcoming comedy shows.  Otto and George were in studio for this segment.

I, sounds like a lot of jail time  All that talking  What, what was that?  I didn't see the news  Sounds like he went to jail though, right?  Blah, blah, blah  Oh my god  Shut up  Shut up, exactly 
[00:09:30]  Wow  We told you guys, uh, I don't know  Well over a month ago  Maybe two months ago  That, uh, this guy would walk  Yeah  And this was just a waste of time  Yeah  And sure enough  They didn't find him guilty of anything  No  It's a big waste of time and money  Again, Los Angeles  Prosecutors out there in California  Not Los Angeles  I don't know where the hell it was  I don't know  Santa Maria  Santa something  Santa Maria  Uh, done  And he walks 
[00:10:00]  They screw it up  Unbelievable  The jury looked like a bunch of people  Like taken from an Oprah audience  Well, those are the only people  They had the sassy old grandma  Did you see her?  Yeah  Don't snap at me, lady  Ha, ha, ha, ha  They all laugh  Woo  Ha, ha, ha  You let a kid touch her go  Ha, ha, ha, ha  Ha, ha, ha  I gotta fuck some more young boys  Don't snap at me, lady  Ha, ha, ha, ha  There you go 
[00:10:30]  Good one  They didn't look like a bunch of freaks  The jury  It's just that whole Oprah audience look that they had  Like, oh, we're gonna  I'm gonna study this case  And make sure I come up with the  Oh, just put him in jail  You know he's guilty  Stop it  He's guilty of something  Not enough evidence  No, the defense lawyers are the ones that are high paid  And they make a better story  They spin better bullshit  But the truth of the matter is  My God 
[00:11:00]  This guy's guilty of something  Sleeping with little kids  So you let him go  Good job, jury  Good job  It's not about justice anymore  It's about how much money you got to defend yourself  Yeah  Well, we've known that for years  But, uh  Ha, ha, ha  Now the jury's all  They're celebrities  Here they are on Good Morning America  They got the juries  Some of the other people on the jury  The old sassy grandma  Look at this crew  These are people that just have time to be on a case 
[00:11:30]  Yeah  That's it  You want to get out of jury duty  This guy, Paul Rodriguez  Looks like he's missing a chromosome  Paul Rodriguez  Does he even know what he was doing?  No  In the jury room?  No  He's hashed it out  Very seriously, I'm sure  Big exciting  The most exciting thing that ever happened to these people  Oh  I say there's not enough evidence  Six jurors speak out  Let's go real fast  I mean, everybody always thought  Good Morning America  There were no more African Americans  On the jurors 
[00:12:00]  Everyone always wondered if it would have been any different  I mean, not everyone wondered  But I guess people who assume sort of racial stereotypes  I just want to know from you  How you felt about this verdict  All the way going through  So that everybody out there can hear that  Well, when I first started  I felt really bitter  Because I was the only black African American  I wasn't even a juror  I was an alternate  That's what really made me mad  Yeah  People out there  Yeah, he's a black guy  I decided myself  Because I developed friendship throughout the whole 20 jurors 
[00:12:30]  He's barely black  I know  He's all nervous  I trusted him  I really did trust him  Why is he bitter that he was the only black juror?  I don't get that  I guess because he felt that they were using some kind of racial tactic  To try to prosecute him  But they were trying a white woman  Yeah, that old gag  I'm sorry  There's no...  I think if the jury was black  They probably would have convicted him  He's alienated the black community  Yeah 
[00:13:00]  You know?  All right, well  They're babbling with the jurors on Good Morning America  Anthony, well, we have some of these high-profile things that happen on our show  We go to one of our experts in the field  Let's say hi to Black Earl  Ah  Earl, what's going on today?  What's happening, brother?  Earl, big news in the African American community today  Michael Jackson  Innocent of all charges  Black people must be celebrating in the streets  Like at the OJ trial, right? 
[00:13:30]  Hardly  Our take on it is  Hey, another white person got away with murder  Oh  Oh  Michael Jackson  You don't accept him as a brother?  I don't think we accept him as a human being  We don't even know what he is anymore  A brother of the skin  If you look at his fingernails  Underneath his fingernails, he's still a black man  He can't get rid of that  You can't bleach that away  Unless you have him pried up  And apply the bleach  And then paste him back on or something  Because under his fingernails  Michael Jackson is as black as you, Earl 
[00:14:00]  You can see it  Those creepy hands  Those creepy pale hands  Have black man's fingernails  Looks like a corpse's hands  It does  It's all pale and white  And then he's got like black fingernails  Like Nosferatu  Ready to touch a child's bare buttocks  Earl, will this help or hurt record sales?  His career's been over for 10 years  So it really won't matter  I don't know  Hope was saying that it'll probably help him out career-wise 
[00:14:30]  I think I believe him, you know  I think this is one of those things that  You could see another resurgence  If he decides to come out and put out some product  Yeah, because of all the attention he just got in the last year or so  Now people want to see the freak again  Well, I think it's an OJ situation where he won the case  But he, I think in the court of public opinion, he did it  You think a lot of people still think he's guilty?  Yeah, oh, of course  I think 
[00:15:00]  You know what?  They never had the DNA evidence  I said that all along  They didn't have that one bombshell piece of evidence that was going to put this guy away  The other thing was everyone in the case was so shady  Yeah, on both sides  There were all these shady liars  And you had to really sort out who was a compulsive liar  And who was telling the truth  And then there's celebrities thrown in  It was a little weird, the whole thing  I mean, my take on it is 
[00:15:30]  I think he's nuts  And I think he did something  But he really doesn't have any idea what he's been doing  Yeah, you think?  I don't know  I think anybody knows that touching children is not the right thing to do  Well, I think he's looking at it the way a kid looks at it  Oh, I'm tired of that excuse  Right  He lost his childhood, so he's living it now  Stop it  He knows exactly what he's doing  He knows what he enjoys  He comes off as being so weird in public 
[00:16:00]  Because it's a great means of camouflage for his shenanigans  But behind closed doors, he knows what he's doing  And he knows it's wrong  I dare say that he's brilliant  He is brilliant  He's a super genius  He knows how to work people  He knows how to work the media  He knows how to work his own image  He knows exactly what he's doing, Earl  But child molestation, that's the career killer right there  Not for him  Not for him, he's innocent  Everyone seems to be fine with it as long as it's Michael Jackson 
[00:16:30]  Even, he's innocent of all those charges with the alcohol, too  I was listening to the verdict  Why four or five different alcohol charges?  Ah, they were squeezing everything in there  Trying to get him on something  No, but here's the other thing  How dopey is prosecutors in California?  Very  How many big cases are these guys going to blow?  They blow them all the time  They've blown them all, I believe  I can't remember the last one  They were able to, you know, convict somebody 
[00:17:00]  They can't seem to figure this out  I believe the last case they got was a Fatty Arbuckle  Back in 1905 or something  The Fatty Arbuckle Coke bottle up the pussy case  Is that what he did to that girl?  Yeah, it was something  It was like he took a Coke bottle  Shoved it in the girl  And pulled it out so fast  That he ripped her insides out  And she bled to death  They blew that case, too  Did they blow the Fatty Arbuckle case?  Yeah, they were three mistrust  How do you know about the Fatty Arbuckle case? 
[00:17:30]  I saw it on TV the other day  I saw that they might be retrying that case  Come on  Dude, someone help me out here  I took a peek while we were doing a show  I think it was last week  And I saw his face  Really?  And something like  Are they going to retry it?  Are they going to revisit it?  Fatty Arbuckle  And how did he rip her insides out?  Did he use the  I don't know  Half of it's urban legend  Half of it's rumor  Did he use the wide end?  You think?  You know, the old days  They were very thick  Those bottles  And just rip it out  And he seemed to have caused  Some internal injury 
[00:18:00]  I was a film student  I had a really good film teacher  And it's one of the biggest  Miscarriages of justice  Really?  Ever  Because he  They tried him, I think, three times  Three hung juries  And it was one of those cases  Where he technically won the case  But he  The court of public  It ruined his career  He's one of the biggest stars  In the history of Hollywood  Yeah  What about the  William Randolph Hearst  Shooting case? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, the Hearst case?  Yeah  Oh, he shot her  He shot her  He shot Thomas Hens  Yeah  He shot Thomas Hens  He shot  Yeah, the guy  He shot  He shot him  He shot the wrong guy  Over the chick  He was supposed to kill  What, Charlie Chaplin?  He was supposed to shoot  Charlie Chaplin  Are you serious?  But they had the same build  He thought it was the same  He shot him  Shot the wrong guy  Shot him  And they completely  Covered that one up  And he walked  Nothing even came of it  There wasn't even a trial  They cremated the body 
[00:19:00]  Immediately  He said no autopsy  All kinds of shenanigans  Out there in California  God, Earl  You should  Believe Luella Parsons  Saw it  Yeah  And he gave her  A lifetime contract  Who knew that Earl  Was an expert on these  I know  We finally found  Something you could do  I'm going to call  Celebrity justice  I think I got a job  For you finally, Earl  We found something  You do well  That's right  Anything else, Earl?  No, I mean  Would you  Would any American promoter 
[00:19:30]  Book this guy  Michael Jackson for a tour?  Of course they would  Of course they will  What are you saying?  Promoters are nice people  That have some kind of morality?  Promoters are the worst  No, but think of it  If Don King could not book a tour  Nobody could book one tour  Well, it's the whole lack of interest  Is why they weren't booking him  Not because of their  You know, beliefs or anything  That's for sure  With all the attention he's getting now  You watch  They'll be promoting him  All over the world  Oh my God, man 
[00:20:00]  No, but after the settlement in 93  He could not get a booking  Anywhere  And the only place  He can get booked is Europe  Yeah  For Europe?  Absolutely  He's going to make a ton of money  Well, they were saying last night  He's still huge in Europe  He sold over a million records  In Europe last year  Yeah  So did Slim Whitman  With his scrotling  All right, Earl  If you have anything else  You call back, okay?  All right  Power to the people, Earl  Power to the people  There he goes  Black Earl  How's that Black Rock Coalition 
[00:20:30]  Coming along with him?  He's still working  The Black Rock Coalition  One day that's going to click  And we'll all be made fools of  I go to dinner  I go to dinner with Earl  Maybe once a week  And he's still  He's keeping that dream alive  He's keeping that dream alive  Keep hope alive  Keeping that dream alive  Through the magic of radio  I think we're going out  To the Neverland Ranch  Really?  Yes  Chuck  Good morning, guys  There's Chuck Farnham  Old friend of the program  Yes, sir  Hey, and by the way  That's room 1446  At the St. Francis Hotel  If you're looking for Fatty Arbuckle  Whoa, you know a little bit 
[00:21:00]  About Fatty Arbuckle  I've been in the bathtub  Yeah  Wait, he was found in the bathtub?  I mean, the chick was found  In the bathtub?  Yeah  Give us a little background  On that case  What are the facts?  Yeah, I want to know more  About Fatty Arbuckle  I know a rumor  But I love Fatty Arbuckle  Yeah, who cares about  Michael Jackson  Well, she was a hooker  And she had venereal disease  And they were working her  Over in the tub  And it became a big problem  Because she started bleeding  Because of the hemorrhaging  Yeah  Is it true they used a Coke bottle 
[00:21:30]  Or  Yeah  Yeah, okay  A Coke bottle  And it ruined Fatty's career  In such that  If you go looking for  Fatty Arbuckle material  Yeah  You can't find it anywhere  There's very little of it around  Because they destroyed all of it  They did  Like all of Masters  And Master Reels  And stuff  Yeah  They were after him big time  It's so weird  I mean, thank God  We live in these times  These timesies  We bitch about the FCC  And political correctness 
[00:22:00]  But back then  When this case was out there  No one knew that  This girl was worked over  With a Coke bottle  Coke bottle  They just said  There was a murder  They didn't have  Fatty Arbuckle CSI  With a guy in the bathtub  Looking at the Coke bottle  Sees a little chip of paint  From the word Coke  Like analyzes it  Finds out what factory  It came from  And realizes it was a Coke bottle  All we knew was  She was just murdered  Right  Yeah, funny guy though  If you see any of his stuff  It's extremely funny  Is it?  Yeah, yeah  He's hysterical 
[00:22:30]  He's very  Very physical comedian  Yeah, well it was  Those old times  Where they were all  Scary looking on film  Yeah  It's kind of frightening  I couldn't imagine  Fatty Arbuckle  Trying to be cool  With a chick  You only picture him  With a Coke bottle  Sucking her womb out  Right  He kind of looked like  The Michelin man too  He's kind of a  He's a very pudgy guy  He looked like  Almost like  The  Not Chubsy-Ubsy  From The Little Rascals  But the other fat guy  That was on earlier  Than Chubsy-Ubsy  Yeah  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:37:00]  We understand  All right well there you go  Our first phone call from Alaska Anthony  I think Mike wants to know how close to the fortress of solitude is he  Superman's retreat  That's very funny Mike  Damn well we missed one  Very nice  All right let's see  Let's go to David in Jersey  David what's up  600 words for snow but only one for uninteresting nitwits  That's right  Oh that's another one we missed  That's right they have like 600 words for snow  Of course they do 
[00:37:30]  All right what's up David  Fatty Arbuckle  Yeah  Name of the girl in that whole incident  Virginia raped  R-A-P-P-E  Yeah  And  Define irony  First trial was November of 1921  That's when this happened  Three trials later he was acquitted  But his career never made it back  He died I guess at 46  Fatty Arbuckle  Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle 
[00:38:00]  Oh that's her  They all looked at the same back then didn't they  I'm looking at a picture of Virginia  And she was like a notorious Hollywood chick  And she crashed Fatty's party that he was having  He was having a party and she crashed the party  And ended up you know later that night  With Fatty  And he wound up doing something that made her start bleeding internally  I had no idea it was a coke bottle 
[00:38:30]  Yeah  How do you know it was a coke bottle?  I just heard that  I don't know  Growing up it was the Fatty Arbuckle story  I don't know how I know  What kids tell the Fatty Arbuckle story?  I don't know  You know growing up I heard some weird shit  Old friend  I know  I don't know why as kids we would have heard that  Like in the 70s  Why growing up would they  You know I even know about Fatty Arbuckle  But I don't know  It just popped up  This is going to be another one of those weird Opie and Anthony programs  We're talking about Alaska and Fatty Arbuckle 
[00:39:00]  And one of the biggest stories hit the AP today  Michael Jackson acquitted  Michael  But we're more concerned about Fatty Arbuckle  And what's going on in Alaska  That's because it's another notorious case out there in California  But it was kind of a long time ago  Yeah well Tracy on Long Island  What's up Tracy?  Hey what's up?  Hey  I just wanted to let you know it's called an ice auger  Oh an auger right  Yeah  Just so it'll help you out  Looks like kind of a big corkscrew-y looking device  Yeah exactly 
[00:39:30]  Yes  How do you know that?  I've been ice fishing up in Lake George  You were?  Yes I have been  That sounds like a real boring thing to do  Yeah you know it's a little scary too  When the ice is making all those crazy noises  And you feel like you're going to fall through  Crazy noises  You're sitting there and the ice is going  No I know exactly what she's talking about  Because we rented a house when I was going to college at Geneseo  We decided to live on the lake  We were called the lake brothers man  Yeah 
[00:40:00]  And we all had to buy one car that we shared  We bought a car for like $200  Because it was about a five mile ride to campus to go to class and stuff  But here's the deal  You look at these lake houses in early September  When it's still what 85, 90 out  And you're like look what we got for the whole year  It's so fucking cool  Yeah  And it's you know Geneseo is relatively close to Buffalo  So you can figure it out  Within two weeks it's already winter  And now your lake house just stinks  Because you're on this huge lake that just makes the whole area colder  But we would get so shit faced in town 
[00:40:30]  And then drive back to the lake  And then we would get high  And we would walk into the middle of the lake  In the middle of the night you can't hear nothing  I mean because it's way out in the boonies  And I know what she's talking about  But all of a sudden the ice kind of talks to you  It sounds like whales  No  Yes  It sounds like whales Anthony  She's not lying  Yeah because what happens is you know  The ice is constantly cracking and expanding  All that junk  And if you're in the middle of the lake  And you get one of these cracks close to you  It is the scariest thing ever 
[00:41:00]  First of all you think the whole ice is going to collapse  And you're going to die  But when you get past that point  It just starts echoing  Well sometimes if you throw ice cubes in a drink  And pour like booze in it  You hear like that crack  And then a squeaky like  Yeah yeah yeah  Sound  Yeah yeah  Is that it?  Well just picture that with  Really really big ice cubes  You ever hear your ice cubes squeak?  Yeah  So she's not lying  I know exactly what she's talking about  It's really creepy  And sometimes you'll hear the crack  Start I don't know  A couple hundred yards away from you  And just kind of  By you sort of 
[00:41:30]  That's creepy  So you hear it coming from your left  And going all the way to your right  That's real creepy  And then you hear it kind of echoing  You know below where the water is  It is  Right  It is  It's so scary that you just want to get on land immediately  You know  Especially because you're high  So you're thinking all sorts of dumb stuff  Yeah  No paranoid  You're thinking there's some kind of  Loctus monster under the ice  Dumb, dumb, dumb stuff  Alright Tracy  Thanks  Alright take it easy guys  You brought back a good memory  Yeah  All that's going through my mind now  Is Stalker Patty sitting at home 
[00:42:00]  With a cup and some ice  And pouring different things in here  Doing an experiment  Yeah we should introduce Tyson Walter  From the Dallas Cowboys  Yes  Hanging out  Back in New York  A little bit back in New York  Yeah  Nice  So you got all the things off your arm  Yeah  Yeah  No more problem  No  Little problem  I got things off my arm  Really  Is it kind of stiff  I've got the full range of motion  Oh  Jesus  You still can't move that wrist huh  I can a little bit  I can go side to side and back 
[00:42:30]  The down motion is the one giving me fits  Really  Yeah  But you're not  It'll be 18 months before I know how much it'll come back  But you're not a left handed quarterback so who cares  Exactly  You'll be fine  Exactly  You could still rack some head  Yeah  Come punch a dude  It's cool  By the way Anthony  A couple more on Fatty Arbuckle  Eric from Jersey  Go ahead Eric  Yes  The Fatty Arbuckle  It was  He learned that when he was hanging out with Groucho Marx  Taking pictures  I did not  Groucho never told me about Fatty Arbuckle 
[00:43:00]  Yes he did  Where else would you learn something like that  All right punch it out  All right  You've met a guy that could have easily been drinking with Fatty Arbuckle  How old are you man  No  That is the question everyone wants to know  I was a little kid in the 70s and I met Groucho  You ever hear this story?  Anthony one day just casually mentions that he got a picture with Groucho Marx  Groucho Marx  Exactly  That's the reaction we get from everybody 
[00:43:30]  What?  I met Groucho Marx at some event in California when I was a kid  And he was  He was like  He was real old  It was just before he died  You know once again  When was Groucho born?  Like if Groucho was alive today  How old would he be?  I'm trying to look  But my internet movie database is screwing up here  Groucho Marx  There it is  Groucho was born in 1890  I met somebody that was born in 1890 
[00:44:00]  You met a guy that if he was alive today would be 115 years old  He was born 25 years after the Civil War  Jesus  1890  Yeah  And he died in 1977  And I met Groucho in like 1974  I met him in 74  Alright  So it was three years before he died 
[00:44:30]  He was you know  He's an old guy dude  He was an old old man  Let's go to Andy in Maryland  Andy  Hey guys what's going on man?  Wasn't a contestant on You Bet Your Life or anything  Stay the secret way  Hey this fatty Arbuckle thing  It was a jagged piece of ice  Not a coke bottle  Oh  That's why they  Yeah they couldn't get the conviction  Because the evidence melted away  Stop it  That's the truth  Stop it  I'm telling you the truth  A jagged piece of ice  The guy was doing it with ice 
[00:45:00]  And ripped their insides open  I'm not believing that  I think that's a more urban myth  Who would allow  What woman would allow ice up there?  A jagged piece of ice  Where'd you get ice in 1920?  You call the ice man  You call the ice man  And the big block of ice goes in there  And then how do you get a shard of ice  Off a block of ice  In your freezer?  How do you get like a  A big ice shard  That you can then injure somebody with 
[00:45:30]  Out of a big cube?  I don't believe it  I believe the coke bottle  Where did you hear about the coke bottle?  I don't remember  Now I'm thinking your info stinks  Roscoe threw a party  Which was crashed  By Virginia Rape  Or Rap  Whatever it is  Who fell seriously  Seriously ill  Died a few days later  And the papers  Led by the Hearst Group  Made this the first  Notorious crime  That people followed 
[00:46:00]  In the newspaper  And I guess  All the gory details  Were in the newspaper  And that's probably where  I got the coke bottle thing from  Because you read the 1921 newspaper?  Yes  I was  Me, Groucho  We were sitting around  Had a couple drinks  Chuck Limburg  My buddy Chuck Limburg  We called him  Yeah we hung out  Read the papers  You and the Great Gatsby  The Great Gatsby  Yeah we were all hanging  Some mansion on  You know  Out in Long Island 
[00:46:30]  Out in Long Island  Yeah that's  All of us used to hang together  In the old days  Over at FDR's place  Yeah  Play football with Joe Kennedy  Jim Thorpe  Jim Thorpe  Just like you're going  To a wedding  But that's  No that was just  Normal wear  On a hot summer day  Sure  Anthony tell Opie  About the time  You and Charlie Chaplin  Went out picking up whores  Oh yeah  Here they come  And I'm sure  The photoshops will follow  They always do  It's easy people 
[00:47:00]  All you gotta do  Is  Switch  My pictures  Over to black and white  It's easy to do  In photoshop  Just go to grayscale  And have a pisser  Bastards  Alright once again  Like I said  A few minutes ago  Tyson Walter in studio  Who's a huge fan  Of Jim Norton's  Yep  And Jimmy  Was on  The Tonight Show  Last night  With Jay Leno  Did you see it yet?  I watched it last night  My bets are in  I give Jimmy  Six more months  On this show  And he's gone 
[00:47:30]  That's it  And we lose him  Yeah  He's going to be  Much too big  The offers are going  To come in  And then we're going  To be stuck  With this motherfucker  Who's outside the glass  Right now  Buying Rolls Royce  Off the eBay  As Jimmy  Is propelled  To the ultimate stardom  And forgets our names  Yeah  We'll be stuck  Ladies and gentlemen  Rich Voss  I guess we've got to  Start giving you  A lot more respect  Because we're going  We're going to be  Losing Jim Norton soon  So losing Jimmy  We're doing our pilot  Next week  Wait a minute  What?  We're doing our pilot 
[00:48:00]  Next week  You are  But I  You know  We don't know  If it's going to be  Picked up or anything  Until you're on  The Tonight Show  Killing like Jimmy  Did last night  It was ridiculous  He sat down with Leno  And went back and forth  With him for ten more minutes  And it was just  Killer stuff  It was sharp  Very funny  And like  Very on the edge  For network television  Alright listen  Elliot exaggeration  It wasn't  Elliot exaggeration  Elliot exaggeration  What show were you watching?  He killed  No I said he killed 
[00:48:30]  Too busy bidding  On a Sherman tank  You just picked  The worst e-name too  Elliot  You should have said Ernie  First of all  Earl  Earl  Ernie better than Elliot  For what we learned today  Remember that  Bidding on a 747  Oh you're bidding  On a 747  He killed  He killed  I was watching  I was really happy  And I'm probably  The only comic  That called him before  And said good luck  Have a good set  Because none of our friends  Are nice enough to do that  Of course not  And he did  He destroyed 
[00:49:00]  And he was so  You know what  He was so comfortable  Yeah  That's what it was  He sat down  Completely comfortable  Because the B material  When you're that comfortable  You know B material comes out  B material  B material  It's too bad  That the plane  Lost his luggage  And he had to  Wear that outfit  But  Yeah we gotta rag him  About that  What the hell  Was he wearing  Bonnie wrote that  Really good  Good one Bonnie  Why don't we talk  To Bonnie  We don't need to  Talk to you anymore  That is funny man  He came out  And he was wearing 
[00:49:30]  Just a t-shirt  And some  That's his favorite shirt  Oversized shirt  He was wearing my shirt  Unbuttoned  Yeah  It was like  One of Tyson's shirts  That's one of his  Favorite shirts  He's worn that  For a lot of his  Big gigs  I was really excited  You know what  Is so exciting  Besides that  He's a friend  That he's doing  Such edgy material  Yeah  Finally that somebody's  Getting on  You know  On network TV  Yep  I mean I did a prime time  But  And he's doing stuff  That's really  Nice try boss  That he's doing  It's not about you today  Well yeah it is 
[00:50:00]  I didn't take a train  Alright to talk about  Meaty breasts  Alright  I'm gonna talk about it  Wednesday  His mic stinks right  Is that why you're coming in  He's really low  Yeah it is low  Why is that  Is he pushed all the way up  Here  Boss just jump over to that mic  See if that works better  Damn it  I had him cranked too  That's better  I don't feel comfortable  Over here  But you know  Doing that edgy material  He did  And it was great  When he said about  You know  Too old  About the girl  Yeah yeah 
[00:50:30]  Oh my god  Well we got the whole thing  We're gonna do  We're gonna give  Jim Norton's stand up  You know  A listen here  From the tonight show  And then his couch time  As well  Yeah  But going back  To what Anthony said  Anthony thinks  Six months  He's off this show  He's done  So I guess  We gotta start  Treating you a little better  This is  Yeah  He's gonna hit  Let me tell you  If that HBO show  Hits  And then his special  Let me tell you something  He's gonna do really well  He's gonna be able to pick up  Like fives  Instead of fours now  That's what  But he'll move on 
[00:51:00]  He's doing this gig  Because it  It definitely  Pays his bills  He's really got  No other huge  Source of income  Hawking his  T-shirts  And  CDs  But  I don't know  I think  Offers will come in  Where  He's not gonna be able  To turn them down  It's gonna be for more money  Than he's making  Doing this  And that's when we lose him  Bye bye  And then what we do  We just hose down that seat  And welcome  Rich Vossen's program  Like when someone 
[00:51:30]  Gets killed at Disney  It happens every year or so  Someone's on a ride  They get killed at Disney  What does Disney do?  Shut the ride down  Close the park down  They  They put up the little barriers  They hose it down  Open it up  Like it never happened  You're back in business  Let me explain about Norton  Because Norton's like my best friend  I've known him  Norton  Middle name should be Stepping Stone  But  You know  He might have used  You know  He went from you  Like dice  To you  To Colin  Back to you  But here's the thing  He'll hit big  But he'll self-destruct  And something will happen 
[00:52:00]  And it'll probably be  With a black male  With a wig  And what's gonna happen is  They're not gonna tolerate  His nonsense  In Hollywood  And he's gonna be back  He will be back  Beaten down  He'll have a little cash  And you know  But he's gonna hit big  And then he's gonna fall  I see like  And I wanna be outside his house  When he has that garage sale  And he starts stowing  All that stuff  Outside his million dollar condo  He's close to an eBay in Florida  What's that?  Cause it's closer than eBay in Florida  Oh look at the sprained leg football players  Talking to me now  I'm fine right now 
[00:52:30]  Oh you are?  You wanna go Oompa Loompa?  Let's go  Guys ten times my side  Wanna play me in golf or cash?  I'll play you in golf or cash  Oh my god  I will  My money's on him  Wow  Really?  Cause he drives a ball fart  I'll take three clubs and beat you  Are you out of your mind?

Talking to I mean  Alright  Three clubs and you'll be there  300 yard drives  No problem  Big deal  Drive for show  Punt for dough  Probably even further  Oh you make that up?  I like that 
[00:53:00]  You should get that on a t-shirt  Actually  You should get that on a t-shirt  You never heard that  Actually I played golf with both you guys  It would be a very good match  He drives the shit out of the ball  And hits it straight  Yeah  But on the greens  He's like a gorilla  He has no touch whatsoever  Be fair  When we played  It was January  And I haven't played in six months  So  That's my disclaimer  I saw him drive a par four  Yeah  And then four  Look at those big gorilla arms  He's gonna touch the ball  And it's gonna fly back  And erupt  That was a donut hole  Trying to eat it 
[00:53:30]  This guy has no touch  But man  He could hit the shit out of a ball  Very good  So did you guys talk about Michael?  No we'll get into that after the break  What we're gonna do here  We're gonna play Norton's set from Jay Leno last night  Funny man  It's unbelievable  The video's up on opianthony.com  Foundrymusic.com  Yeah  And when you listen to this  Just remember  This is on fucking NBC  That's what we're saying in the office  When we're watching this  We're like  This  Jay Leno  You know  I wasn't buying Norton's whole argument 
[00:54:00]  Between Jay Leno and Letterman  But I'm just starting to see it now  Yeah  I'm just starting to see it  You get away with a lot more  I understand that now  Unfortunately  Listening to audio too  You don't get the expression thing  Because there were a couple of times  That he got the audience roaring  Just from a look  He looked over  And did  When he looked at Hilary Duff  Yeah  Like  Hi  You know  And she was just  Looking into the eyes  Of a rapist  And Jay  You know  Turns to him  And just  Says  17  17  And he's like 
[00:54:30]  Bam  Two seconds  Oh  Too young  Too old  I stink  Too old  This is a huge day  I rot  God I fucked that whole thing  I know  But you know why  I think he gets away with a lot more  Thank you  Thank you  But then boss had to jump in  And now it's all fucked up  No I was  I was acknowledging that  I had to call myself a dick  For that one  But I was  I was just gonna hose it off  Hose it down  I was gonna hose that joke off  Move on  What were you gonna say boss  I think he gets away with a lot more  On Leno  Because Leno still does stand up  And he's a stand up comic  He's out there 
[00:55:00]  So he  You know  He lets you get away with more  He appreciates it more  Yeah  You know what I'm saying  It's not like  Yeah he knows what comedy's about  What comics are  He's out to clubs  Leno goes to the clubs every week  Letterman has no clue  Alright let's go to Bill  In North Carolina  Bill what's up  Hey first Bob  Let me preface  The whole thing with  Jimmy is freaking awesome  He killed last night  It was wonderful  But I'm just sick and tired  Of Opie and Anthony  And everybody out there  Caressing Rich Voss' ego  Every time he comes on the show  Oh he killed  He's a freaking nobody man 
[00:55:30]  He gets on there  And just  You gotta start telling me  What a great job Jimmy did  And as soon as he does  Oh I'm doing a pilot  Oh Bobby this  You know Rich  We don't give a fuck  You are a worthless piece of shit  Yeah how much money  Are you making this week  How much money  Are you making this week  Why suck and cock for it Rich  How much money  Are you making this week  I made fucking cock for it Rich  Neither am I  How much money  Are you making  How much  Cheap ass  Used car sales  And motherfuckers  Oh hey hey  You know what  Obviously I'm doing my job  Because look at how angry you are  I'm doing my job  As a comic 
[00:56:00]  Because you're so angry  Now keep listening  Faggot  Alright  Yeah Bill  Can you go on eBay  And buy a Rolls Royce  That's right  Alright  And let me tell you something  I've done three network TV shows  In the last two years  Stupid  Alright let's go to  Will in Jersey  Will what's up  Hey guys  Hey make it fast Will  Yeah alright  I just wanted to say  Do you notice when Jim sits down  Jay Lana retracts that little footstool he had up for Hillary Duff  That was funny  And Jimmy's feet don't quite hit the ground  He's got to do a little 
[00:56:30]  Yeah his feet were dangling off the big guest chair  And Jay said something like  You don't need that do you  And he pulled away the thing that Hillary Duff had to use  And there's a little electronic thing  And Jimmy was like on his tippy toes  Trying to touch the floor  His little feet were dangling down  In a huge chair  That's all I got guys  Alright good enough  Let's go to Brian in Boston  Brian what's up  Hey morning boys  Morning  Do us all a favor  Jimmy leaves  Can you just pick someone from random  At Fenway  Oh we'll do that old gag  Yeah  Hey we're going to be checking ticket numbers 
[00:57:00]  At Fenway Park  And deciding who's going to be  A co-host on the Opie and Anthony show  Stupid hack radio bit  Ugh  Alright why don't we play Norton's set  From last night on the Leno show  Alrighty  On the Leno show  Jay Leno's tonight show  Huge huge night for Jim Norton  And a nice little mention for the Opie and Anthony program as well  Absolutely  That's not going to hurt us  That's very good  So without further ado  Check out the audio  The video's up on our website 
[00:57:30]  He's on the Opie and Anthony show  On XM satellite radio  Every single morning  June 25th  He'll be at the State Theater  In Falls Church, Virginia  Please welcome  Jim Norton  Thank you  Thank you  How are you?  Good  There's always this weird moment  When you first look at the audience  Like I'm hoping you're going to be a great crowd  And you guys are kind of looking  And hoping I don't suck  And the most common question you get as a comedian 
[00:58:00]  What happens if you tell a joke  And it bombs  To be honest  I tend to just go to the next joke  There aren't exactly a lot of options  Not like I can run through the room  And tickle you individually  And it's not uncomfortable for a comic  It's a part of our job  The reason that frightens audience members  Is because in your own lives  You don't have the next joke option  It's much harder to bomb in real life  Like you ever try to be funny  Around your girlfriend's family  Or your co-workers  And it gets a zero 
[00:58:30]  Like the kind of bomb  Where they just avoid eye contact  With you for a little while  You got to just stand there  And soak in your humiliation  With your stupid eye-bombed face  You ever try to play it off  Like you didn't mean it to be funny  You ever have a joke bomb so badly  It may have been a serious statement  So you try to sneak out of it  By going, oh, I'm just saying  You know, maybe you're at work 
[00:59:00]  The big meeting's about to start  Your boss walks in  There's no eye in team  You're like, yeah, but there's two in syphilis  I'm just saying  I'm actually enjoying my time back in Los Angeles  I live in New York  I got ripped off this week, man  I went for a massage  Did you know there are  Legitimate massage places?  I, honest to God, had no idea 
[00:59:30]  I thought she was kidding  She finishes with my feet  She's like, all done  I'm like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  It was awful  I'm on my stomach for 55 minutes  She finally turns me over  And she said, all right  I'm going to crack your toes  Which means she grabs each toe  Squeezes it and yanks on it  Which, you know, right idea, wrong location  I felt like such a creep  Every time she grabbed her toe 
[01:00:00]  I tried to scooch down two and a half feet  I'm a lonely man  I've been single almost three years  Kind of playing the field  I call it playing the field  You might call it picking up prostitutes  And I've fallen into this place  With this girl I know  This horrible place  But I have become  The guy friend  Is there anything more repulsive  Than being the guy friend  And women, you always know when we like you 
[01:00:30]  And you deny it even to your girlfriends  You're like, I think he's in love with you  You're like, ah, no, we're just friends  He enjoys taking me to the airport  And there is nothing worse as a man  Than when you're hitting on a woman  And she has that awful  Blocking male friend  Because you can just feel his energy  You're trying to talk to her  He's like, dude, don't hurt her  She's like my sister  Is she really, you, fun-draining cancer? 
[01:01:00]  Why does a guy always make a sister figure  Out of some brawless model  Who looks like Jessica Simpson?  Listen, you never hear a man claiming that  About a fat chick with facial hair  Even if she is your sister  You keep it under your hat  Ugh, who's that?  I don't know  We met at a barbecue once  I think we have the same parents  So I don't know what to do  About this girl I like  I really am very uncomfortable  Around women  I know you look at me  And you think, God  It must be so easy for you  If I get really nervous 
[01:01:30]  I mean, this  Was just a front  And for me  Making the first move  Means you roll down  The passenger window  You know, beep, beep  You know, she gets in  You hope it's not a guy  You ever make that mistake?  You don't get your money back  That's why my motto 
[01:02:00]  Is toughen up and finish  Hey, look, I'm not gay  This is a matter of economics  I wish I was gay  Gay men are lucky  You can go out and rob banks  If you get caught and go to jail  Thanks a lot, everybody  You guys were great  Thank you  There you have it  A huge night for Jim Norton  On Jay Leno's Tonight Show  Unbelievable, huh? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  That was huge  Then he sat down  Yeah, that's what I'm getting now  The couch  The couch  The all-important couch  A lot of comics do Leno  You know  But then the couch  The sitting  The chatting  That's huge  It's kind of weird, too  Because  It looked fake  I was saying  It looked fake  When I watched it  It looked like  You went to an amusement park  And they kind of 
[01:03:00]  Make you look like  You're on Leno  Or something  Because it's Jimmy  And he's sitting there  And he's talking to Jay Leno  And it's on The Tonight Show  And Hillary Duff is next  And it's like  They just popped him in there  Using some kind of  Green screen technology  Or something  You know, we're pretty jaded  At this point  We've seen a lot of celebrities  And stuff  But I gotta tell you  You're so right  Seeing our  Our old pal  On Jay Leno  Last night  Our little mess  It just didn't seem real  It was like  It was really  It was cool as shit  To check out  But it just didn't seem right  And you know what 
[01:03:30]  He killed the first time  No, could you just  Move over there?  Jesus fucking Christ  What, that was supposed to be fixed?  Yeah, and then they move him over  The fucking mic sucks  And we need all mics today  God  He killed the first time  So the pressure  For him to re-kill  You know what I mean?  Yeah  The first time he was on Leno  He killed that night  So I mean  He killed even more  This time  And that's huge  They'll invite him back now  He'll become a regular  And then he'll do the sitcom  And then he'll do movies  And forget it 
[01:04:00]  Bye bye  Bye bye Jimmy  Let's say hi to George in Texas  George  Hey, what's up guys?  What's up?  Oh, not much  I'm just wondering  If anybody else noticed  Hillary Duff  She looked like she was  Pretty coked out of her mind  She was going like  A hundred miles an hour  Coked out?  She was sticking to her teeth  Like  She's 17 years old  You guys are too much, man  Yeah, she looked coked out, man  That's all our dream  Yeah, she was all energetic  On the Leno show  Or something 
[01:04:30]  Right  She should have just lounged  What, should she have fallen asleep  On the couch or something?  Dude, she looked like  She was on Vicodin or something  She was all slow and shit  You would have known  If she was coked out  Because she has the hugest teeth  I mean  She can't hide the fact  That they would be grinding  Yeah  She's too fat to be coked out  Fat  She's like 98 pounds  That's a good joke  Chris in Dayton, Ohio  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to tell you guys  We watched that at work last night 
[01:05:00]  And you guys sold two extra minutes  To the guys that never laugh  At anything on Leno  And they laughed at Norton  Horribly  They love that guy  And he just killed Hillary Duff  I mean, it was great  All right, very good  It was a good thing to see  Yeah, the looks he was shooting over at  Were just frightening  All right, why don't we play  The couch time then  So after Norton's stand-up  He got to sit down with Jay Leno  A huge honor, I would assume  A lot of these comedians 
[01:05:30]  They just do their thing  And that's it  Yeah  But Norton got to do some couch time  Sit down, do the couch time  And he killed there too  So are you liking L.A. now?  I know you are a dyed-in-wool New York  Are you enjoying your time here?  I actually  I used to hate L.A.  But I have one stupid hobby  And L.A. is great for that  I get pictures with celebrities  Which I annoyed you for  The first time I was here  And I've been doing it for years  And it's very rare  That I've ever turned down  By a celebrity  For a picture or an autograph  And I finally realized why  It's because I look  Like I could be a problem  Yeah  There is just something 
[01:06:00]  About my rapidly blinking eyes  That's why I took the picture  Yeah  I just  I don't want to be  Problem with this  It's not that people  Think I'm going to  Kick their ass  But I do look like  I might bite your face  And I came to realize  This years ago  I'm an Ozzy Osbourne fanatic  And my friend sneaks me  Into MTV  He's like  Alright man  Just kind of hang back  So I walk by  An open dressing room door  And there is Ozzy  So I stare  And Ozzy is talking  And he looks out at me  And when he looks at me  I smiled 
[01:06:30]  And licked my lips  And he kind of  Walked out of view  So I couldn't stare  At him anymore  And I realized  I'd made him uncomfortable  And then it dawned on me  Do you know what a weirdo  You have to look like  To make Ozzy Osbourne  A good actor  Exactly  Well any other  Any other celebrities  That you've seen  I don't even necessarily  Have to be a fan  I remember I was opening  For Dice in Vegas  Years ago  And Tiger Woods  Was in the crowd  I don't like golf  I think golf sucks  And golf clubs are great  For assaulting people  Yeah  But I like Tiger Woods 
[01:07:00]  So I walk up to him  After the show  And I'm nervous  And I'm like  Hello Mr. Woods  And he is such a sweet guy  He's like  You were awesome  Which was odd  To hear a black guy  Go awesome  Yeah he's black  And I wanted to have  Like a nice moment  With him  And I just got  Really intimidated  He's like  You were awesome  I'm like  Thanks man  You golf good  Yeah 
[01:07:30]  You ever open your mouth  And wish you had a shotgun  With a toe attachment  I have one second  With this icon  I sound like an extra  From M.A.S.H.  You golf good  Me have head wound  Hawkeye  Well how about dating  Are you seeing anyone  Right now  I give people the creeps  It's hard for me to date  Hard to date  I have a tendency  To be too toothy  When I smile  Which really grosses  A girl out  If you're in a boy  You're like  Where are you from  And then I rub my hands  Together vigorously 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  While staring at her  Cleavage and mumbling  Nice  Yeah right  Yeah right  I can see how  That could be a problem  Uh  Hi  Hi  Hey did you uh  Can you just simulate that problem  Every once in a while  Yeah  17  What's that  17  Ooh  Drolls  Now did you watch the 
[01:08:30]  Did you watch the Tyson fight  Saturday  Uh the Tyson fight  I actually did not watch  I had my  Probably my most  Embarrassing experience  Uh trying to get a Tyson autograph  Uh years ago  In uh  In New York  About five years ago  Uh Mike Tyson's  Outside the comedy cell  With a big entourage  And I go up to get an autograph  And his bodyguard goes  Whoa whoa whoa man  Where are you going  And I said  Oh man I just wanted to get  An autograph  He goes  Sorry man  Mike's not meeting anyone tonight  And I actually said  But he's the champ  I was 31 years old 
[01:09:00]  And I regressed to  Five year old boy talk  To get the signature  Of a rapist from Brooklyn  He's the champ  Jim very funny  He's on the opening  Anthony show  Every morning  On satellite radio  And of course  At the state theater  In Falls  Thank you  Thank you buddy  There you have it  The man of the hour  Jim Norton  And on the phone  It's Jim Norton  Jimmy  Hey what's up guys  There he is  The big star 
[01:09:30]  That was actually  Dumb timing  I'm in a car right now  Going to the airport  In Los Angeles  I just called in  And I'm like  I better do it  Before I actually  Get to the airport  That was good to hear that  Oh yeah  It was perfect  Perfect timing actually  Dude you're getting  Rave reviews from everybody  From all over the country  Oh thanks man  Yeah it was cool  The panel  I put the panel  Well I was very happy with it  It was kind of  You know  It was fun  You were  You were very relaxed  Because we just replayed that  And Voss is in studio  We're all laughing  Because all of a sudden  You go to Jay Leno  Yo dude  Yeah  Yeah dude

[01:10:30]  I should bring my camera out  And get one on the set  And ask Jay to take it  I heard she was like  Kind of weird with  Slitler's photos  She was like  Taking pictures of people  Really  Yeah I knew  I made sure  I had my manager  Make sure that she was  Actually going to be  On the couch  If not I would have  Had to like you know  Get her as soon as  She walked off the set  But it was cool man  It was definitely  It was definitely nice  And I did what I should have  Done after a great  You know time on television  I went for a swim  With Yoshi  On the roof of the hotel  And that was it  It was awful  You didn't pick up  A hook or nothing  No that night before

How about not shooting heroin  And beating my kids in public  You recommend that to you  Fucking any doctor  Of course  But  Are you going to quit smoking?  That's what my doctor did  This is what a scam artist did  I fucking went in there one day  We're talking  Yeah  And then I  He always asked me about sex  This and that  Because he knows I'm a comic  He's a little pudgy  And I said something about Viagra's  He goes  Well you've got to try Levitra's  Right  So he goes  Here let me give you a couple samples 
[01:34:30]  You know  I go in another room  He opens a drawer  And you know how to have all those samples  So he gives me some sample of Levitra's  Hold on  I want to back up a little bit  But you had to tell the doctor  You were having some kind of problem  No  The doctor's not just going to give you any of that shit  No  No  No no no  I said  When I was in Brazil  You could buy  You could buy  Viagra's over the counter  I just said  That's when I just got back from Brazil  You can buy Viagra's over the counter  He goes  Oh you've got to try Levitra's  I got some samples  So he gives me samples  I get a bill from my insurance company 
[01:35:00]  Two hundred dollars for sexual dysfunction  He charged me  I didn't even say  He charged the insurance company  He just offered me free samples  Well that's what I'm saying  Because he can't just  He can't just give you that stuff  That's you know  He can get a lot of trouble  That's on your medical record  Right  So when you were just casually mentioned  That he could get the Viagra over the counter  He immediately is thinking  Well this guy has a problem getting rods  Yeah  And he's a little uncomfortable telling me  So I'll just say  Ah I want you to try some Levitra  Damn  And then he charges  He charges you for sexual dysfunction 
[01:35:30]  Well if I say  I didn't get laid in a week  Is he going to pick me up a hooker  And charge you  And then charge the insurance company  Well he can't just hand that stuff  He's a scam artist  They love charging the insurance company  Like that  Give you free samples  Yeah  Amounts to just free samples in his drawer  And he's charging the insurance company  A couple hundred bucks  It's a fucking  What a scam  Nice  Hey by the way  I saw the news last night  Viagra being used for children  It was the teaser  And Viagra being prescribed to children  Shame  Shame  Shame

[01:36:30]  Or yeah the obvious  You just need an 8 year old  With a hard on  It turned out to be some lung disorder  Yeah some lung disease  They're giving Viagra to these kids  With a lung disease  Because it opens up  And helps them breathe  But they're going to explain  Why they're sporting wood though  I know  They're breathing great  But geez  What do I do with this thing  You're going to school  With a rod in your pants  Covering it up with your lunchbox

[01:39:30]  Cranking  How does one go from  Talking about  Playing with G.I. Joes  To hey you want to jerk off  And wait a minute  Why are we letting them slide  On the whole junior high thing  You're old enough to know  You're old enough to know  In junior high  I can almost see  If you're an 8, 10  Like whoa  What's going on  You know  But you're talking about  You're 13 or 14 at this point  Yeah  No I was  We were like 15 or 16  Because we were getting high  Are you trying to apply pre-count  To real life applications  What the hell are you doing  We were just  We never touch each other 
[01:40:00]  Or you know  Say anything sexual  Each other  We were just  But I want to know  How you go from  Just sleepover  Where normal people  Just go to sleepover  You hang out  You watch TV  And then you go to sleep  Because we were like  15 or 16  And we never had a girl yet  So we probably thought  It was normal  Yeah but what happened  Like did you go  Hey  Did you  Hey take your pants down  I want to show you something  Yeah  How does it start  Yeah  Thank you Bonnie  Come on  We'd be high  And then we would  Compare boners or something 
[01:40:30]  You don't just compare boners  Like how did you get a boner  I smoked a lot of pot  How did you get a boner  I smoked a lot of pot  With my friends  And it never went from  Pass me the joint  To  Holy shit  Hey look at my boner  It wasn't pot  You would smoke bones  You didn't show off  Your bone  We were doing THC  Not pot  I mean THC makes you  Do stuff like that  Probably  I don't know  I did mescaline acid  Believe me  I did drugs too  Yeah but you didn't  It didn't happen  Ecstasy doesn't make you do that  How did this happen 
[01:41:00]  I don't know  This is going more  Like me and Mickey would  And me and Brian  I guess our whole crew  We just like to jerk off  I don't know  So you're laying in bed  You start jerking off  I guess  Out of nowhere  When you're in the same bed  With the dude  How do you know  It's not going to freak  The guy out  That you start jerking off  We probably do  At the same time  No you don't just do it  At the same time  3, 2, 1  Go  You don't just all of a sudden  Go  Oh my god  You're jerking  I just started jerking off too 
[01:41:30]  Yeah the lights  Like an indie  Where it counts  Like a drag race  That would almost be  Her 3, 2, 1 joke  Right  He plays football  I know  Give him a little  Sorry  I don't have a cool  Bedazzled watch like you  He's too big to fuck with  He's too big  I know  I mean no  I don't know  I mean I  Someday if I ever run into Brian again  I'll ask him  Why did we used to jerk off together  I don't know  I don't think I'd do it with Michael  But Brian, Mickey  It's not the why we're after 
[01:42:00]  It's the how  It's just how  How does that happen  Right  You don't just all of a sudden  Start jerking off together  Someone has to make the first move  And that's what I'm getting at here  Even though you're saying  It's not gay  And why did you go for it  It's not  It's just got  Someone  One of you  Had to make what is called  The first move  Where you start going  You're assessing the situation  You're looking over going  I think he'll be into me jerking off  You're building this up in your head  How  Who made the first move 
[01:42:30]  And how many people said no  Said no  Boss you fucking faggot  What are you doing  And Bonnie  Put that away and go home  And when are you going to give the ring back  What are you waiting for  Jesus  Oh my god  Don't leave me for another man  Please  You can't compete with that  Was there porno involved  Let's start there  We were too young for porno  A barrel faucet monster  Something that might have shown that  You were heterosexual  Something just went awry 
[01:43:00]  Yeah  Cheryl Teagues  Right  I don't know  I don't have any answers  The other porno faucet  Waste basket  Now the reason I'm asking this  Is because I had the similar experience  But I was in a tree fort  In California  With my friend Richard  And it was just like a sleep out  At the tree fort  And I was trying to go to sleep  And we had been drinking too  Of course  There's some kind of alcohol involved  And he leaned over  And he goes  I'll suck your cock 
[01:43:30]  No  Yeah  You want  You want a blowjob  And  And I went  I'm laying there going  Oh my god  I gotta just make believe  I'm asleep  I gotta stay here  Like I never heard it  So I'm just laying there going  I'll suck your cock 
[01:44:00]  And this is like  A guy I've been friends with  For years  We used to ride our bicycles  To go fishing down at Dana Point  Ride horseback  Yeah I mean  It's just a friend of mine  For years  Out of nowhere  Out of the blue  I get  I'll give you a blowjob  So that to me  Is what I would call  The first move

I'm eight  And I'm like  I couldn't cop  Until like my real age  I'm like oh I'm 15  And that's too old  I know  That was too old  That's why I got  Playing checkers  You know  Against people  You want to play again?  No the babysitter  Said lights out  And it's bad  That you're now lying  About your age  And conversing with him  Because if it's a cop  It's like okay  Here's a guy now  Lying about his age  I know  I was done at that point  When I found out  There are eight year olds  Ten year olds  Twelve year olds 
[02:12:00]  I'm like I can't do this anymore  Yeah  There's just something  Very wrong about this  Even though it's  An innocent game of chess  Darren in New York  What's up?  Starts that way  And then someone's  Got a bishop up their ass  What's going on over there?  How we doing?  We're having a good time today  It's a  Yo I just  Before I even get into my story  I just want to let you guys know  I'm so happy  To hear you guys again  On the radio  I was so depressed  When you guys walked  I got to tell you something  Really fast Darren  You know  I'm reading the email every day  And it seems like  Just only recently  A lot of our old fans 
[02:12:30]  Are really starting to  You know  Find us  And get the XM  It's really strange  Listen  I went out and bought  A brand new car  Just to get XM put in it  So that I can listen to you guys  Thank you Darren  I went out and bought  One of those  Not my  The Delphi ones  And I tried putting it in my car  And it just  I would get  I would get intermittent  Intermittent service  So I had to get rid of it  And then I got you guys online  I found out that you guys  I could get you guys online  So I used to listen to you at work  Alright  And now I say  You know something  I have to get an XM car  I got to get a car with XM 
[02:13:00]  So I can listen to you  Alright  Alright Darren  Alright get into my story  Now the guy  Whoever answered the phone  He doesn't believe me  But what I used to do  When I was younger  Much younger  I used to use my grandfather's sander  An electronic sander  And I would  You know  Throw my  Throw my  Dick kind of like down  In between  In between my legs  And put the sander there  And it gives you  It gives you a sensation  Gives you a real nice sensation  Like a belt sander  Or a vibrating like  A vibrating sander 
[02:13:30]  Alright I've seen these kind of sanders  They're like circular  No they go back and forth  They go like that  They  I've seen the ones  That kind of go in a circle  They're rounding on a circle  Or the square ones  That kind of go forward and back  Exactly  Exactly  I found out  By accident  One day I was on my bike  And I had the sander  And it was on  And all of a sudden  I was like  Holy shit  What the hell is that  And I said  Hey wait a minute  That feels kind of good  And I tried  And I tell you  For a couple of years  I used to speak  A couple of years  But everyone was asleep  You just brought back a memory 
[02:14:00]  I used to rock the  The weed whacker  What?  Oh yeah man  I used to rock the weed whacker  Hey what?  The vibrations that came off that thing  My parents couldn't understand  Why I wanted to weed whack  You know  Around the house  Like once a week  Would you put it on  Like would you push it  Against the handle?  Oh yeah  The whole thing would just  No not  I thought you would have  Well you got to explain  It's like  I'm punching out  But once again man  It's great to hear you guys  On the radio  Wait what XM  Thank you  What did he say  He has a MiFi 
[02:14:30]  Or the  I think he was talking  He had some problems  With the Delphi maybe  I have a Delphi in my car  And I've never had a problem  But  Well XM promised me a MiFi  For months  These motherfuckers  First of all  Last time I was here  The guy was going to give me one for free  The guy that was here  And XM  No don't worry  We're going to get you one with service  But since you've been on  I've been saying that  If I put out  Who knows how much money for hotels  And these cheap cocksuckers  Can't get me one goddamn radio  Get him a MiFi  Ben get him a MiFi  I know Ben's been working on that for you  Oh yeah

[02:22:00]  Central Park  Stabbed a puppet  And then without  Didn't like what he was saying  Yeah I guess  I mean you know probably  Must have been something about Puerto Ricans though I would gather  I don't think I was that rough on him  Really  He was hallucinating or something  Yeah  Do you remember the joke you told that got this guy so pissed he went on stage  George probably said you're ugly and then I said tell him you're sorry  And he said I'm sorry you're ugly  It was very light and tame for those days  Right  Nigga  No I'm sorry  Okay  Jesus George  After he stabbed you without missing a beat

[02:24:00]  We did that already  Oh you did  Yeah  Well you guys  I'm telling you  Yeah it was weird because you guys were doing like  You loved like female  Well we  We're just  Hacks  Female  We're awful hacks  I'm really awesome  Xena you thought was pretty cool  When are you doing this grapple network  We  Yeah  Yeah  I had no business being on that show  It is really awful  When they ask you to do it  You're like  Yeah we like female  No it's like it always goes with people talking us into shit 
[02:24:30]  They're like oh this will be really good  You know to get the name out there  And the station you're on  You know not a lot of people know you're on XM at this point  It'll be nice to get the  And they always say you're going to find a new audience  Yeah  And then we go you know okay we'll do it  We get there and go oh this is just going to be bad  Okay tell us something about a superhero girl that you think  I don't know any of this shit  Yeah  Fake it  You look squeezed in there too  Oh they pop it  We're together so tight  They go could you guys get a little closer 
[02:25:00]  We're trying to get you in frame  That's how it starts  Oh that's how it starts  And then we're jerking off each other  Anthony and I have been doing radio over 10 years  We've barely touched each other  Barely  I think we give each other  I was going to say a fist  A little lard  A little fist  Right sure who's looking  I said a lot but I had nothing to say about superheroes  I was goofing on everything else  And obviously that's not what the show was about  I don't know that crap  I don't know a little bit about a little bit of everything 
[02:25:30]  And of course I could just bullshit my way through those things  But then you watch back and you're like  Okay this is a great move  Yeah great career move  Fucking beautiful  You could fly like right here  This is where you're supposed to be  You could fly through the channels  And just fly right past you two guys  And go DJs  Right exactly  Right I know  DJs  Yeah no shit  Gee thanks  Thanks Rich as we're trying to get away from the  At least we got jobs though  I see people on those shows  Like the 90s shows and stuff 
[02:26:00]  It's like the person doesn't even fucking work  That's their job  We had a meeting with Comedy Central  And the person at Comedy Central that's in charge  One of the people that's in charge of our pilot  One day I'm flipping through in Comedy Central  No I love  No  No no no no  It was like some dumb stand up show  Like I can't remember what it was  Sit down stand up  Some where they have like  Some kind of thing  You know five different comics on  Lounge lizards  Or whatever yeah  And the executive is on 
[02:26:30]  Doing stand up  Oh shit  On the show  That takes away from his executiveness  Yeah  No it was a chick  Oh  Anthony  Yeah I said his  Instantly thinking the executive's gotta be the man  Of course  No on TV they're all ladies  That's how we think on the show  Go get some coffee for the men  Anthony I got some examples of our appearance on Bravo  We might as well let these guys smash us today  Oh here we go  This is something we've been avoiding  Like we knew we were on this show  And everyone's like 
[02:27:00]  Hey when are you guys going to talk about your appearance on Bravo  And we make believe we don't read the email  Or the instant feedback  Or the phone calls coming in  I couldn't believe I was on the toilet  You're still on Bravo  I forgot until I was in bed on a Sunday night  And I just turned on the TV real fast  I'm like oh that's right  We did that six months ago  Words of wisdom that people cannot possibly live without  Did we spew out on this show  Here's Anthony talking about Blade  Blade also reflected  A classic Marvel comics archetype  The anti-hero  Whose special powers are also a curse 
[02:27:30]  He doesn't quite belong to either the humans or the vampires  So he's in constant battle with each of them  Plus internally in himself  That adds a lot to the storyline  And it's cool  And it gives him a lot of people to kick ass  Did you hear me in that clip  I went what the fuck did he say  I don't even know  Every pause did you go  I'm not saying anything funny right here  Yeah  You just kept pausing  Nothing funny going on  Nothing funny  My job which was pointed out by the listeners 
[02:28:00]  Was to look at Anthony lovingly through the air  I was going to hope he just turned  And was looking lovingly  And nodding  Nodding  I had the look of love in my eye  That the asshole listeners told me  And when you're doing those shows too  No matter what you say  They're always sitting there going  Great funny stuff  Yeah  Oh that's great  It's great  Yeah clever little sound bites are nice  But nothing's better than cracking somebody's spine in half  Right there Dallas  Fucking sadist  George you're nuts man 
[02:28:30]  He's five times your size  On his coffee  Yeah  He is very big George  Yeah  Gotta pick on him  Whatever  All right well here's Anton  Princess Leia  Maybe I get a word in this time  Okay let's listen for what I hope he has to say  First clip I heard the stardom  It was every young boy's fantasy  To see Princess Leia  In a little slinky leather thing and chains  She got her justice 
[02:29:00]  For Jabba the Hutt degrading her like that  That was cool  Good to watch  I know a little too much about that shit  That was your own personal anger coming out  Yeah  She got what was due  Yeah  Yeah  Jabba the Hutt got it  Good  Good for him  Yeah I don't know  But if you know about the time  Where I put money in the bank  I am quite a faggot  Jesus Christ  While others were circle jerking 
[02:29:30]  Yeah exactly  We would get together and jack off to Star Wars movies  Did you like Princess Leia?  George?  Anyone?  No  She wasn't hot at all  I never cared for the Star Wars movies really  Yeah  Nah  Nah  Have you seen the new one?  The new one's pretty cool  I think Lucas is doing fine without your nine bucks  Right  Right  I know  I'd like to see him do another American graffiti  You know just do something  Yeah something different  Something good  Right  About real people  Yeah  Yeah  Guy's got nothing  Nine bucks  Well this clip says O and A on Princess Leia 
[02:30:00]  So I might get a little time here  There was more to say  She is the only character in Star Wars who hits every target she shoots at  There's a little Star Wars nerdy trivia for you  Kind of bitchy though  Great hairdo  What?  Kind of bitchy  Snotty  Talking about Jimmy  Kind of bitchy  Were you talking about Princess Leia or Jimmy Norton?  Did you call her a fuck face?  Kind of bitchy  All right  There you go  Kind of bitchy  That's what I give everybody  That's Opie's contribution 
[02:30:30]  Kind of bitchy  Get XM after this appearance  Right  They're probably lining up at Satellite  Running out of equipment  Who are those two guys who are on Bravo?  They were kind of bitchy  Lining up around the block at the Best Buy  We suck  All right, well here's O and A on Xena  I think as a teenager you had the fantasy of a woman that knew what she was doing  Would take charge  And Xena definitely filled that bill  Had her little Amazon woman scream  Whatever that was 
[02:31:00]  Kind of scary  You ended everything with kind of cool  Kind of scary  Kind of cool  Kind of gay  I suck  Kind of neat  Oh, is that awful  God, kind of awful  Kind of cool  Yeah, you're right  Oh, what a crutch using ass  And our final clip 
[02:31:30]  Is another one  Let's hear it when I say kind of at the end  I've walked out of auditions knowing  I really stink at this  I'm really bad  You guys could not have walked out of here going  We killed  That went really well  You know what?  No, I got it  It was a who cares appearance  We didn't kill obviously  But we didn't stink  It was who cares  It's like, well it went  And the funny thing is  We sat after this radio show  For two, two and a half hours  Easily, right Dan? 
[02:32:00]  The whole time  With the camera rolling  I'm counting up our time on TV  Forty seconds, fifty  That would  A minute ten  We got a minute ten face time  Out of two and a half hours  What you guys did  As radio personalities  And as funny guys  Clem the spot welder  Could have done what you two did  Right  They could have went down the hall  And said, hey  Put your bucket down  We want you to come in here  And talk about Princess Leia  Because these two stiffs  Have nothing funny to say  What does a spot welder need a bucket?  Did they give you  Someone else  Information about all the people?  In advance?

[02:33:00]  This is Anthony  Talking about Catwoman  Catwoman on all fours  A little clawing across the chest  Stuff like that  Sure  That's it  That's it  Brilliant  That was worth  Wasting two and a half hours  Of our day  Wow  Hearing that twice  Is a delicious torture  The worst  Wow  Well we finally got to that  Huh  And you're going to rerun that

No  She's releasing the doves  With every count  And one flies out  And then she's got to  Shut the lid real quick  Because if two fly out  During one count  She's got to kill herself  Or something  So she goes to like  Smash the cage door down  And one of the doves  Is trying to get out  And it's head got stuck

[02:44:00]  To people  The Jew is poisoning  The planet  The problem isn't  And the case wasn't  About him having  A child within him  It's him within the child  Oh stop it  I think this guy  Chuck makes a good point  Chuck  Hey what's going on  What's up  Hey Michael Jackson  Has got this all  Peter Pan complex  Thing going on  Because he didn't have  A child  That was a kid  Yeah  How long has his childhood  Lasted as an adult  Yeah  Shouldn't his adult childhood  Be over  I wish my childhood

That was fucking horrible  Yeah  You have like  Bad parenting or something  Well they divorce parents  You know  You're just doing shit  To get attention 
[02:45:00]  I mean I was fucking  Shooting  All his friends were gay  Playing roulette  In fourth grade  Cutting school  Stealing money  My parents were divorced  I didn't go on a tear like that  With drugs and gambling  I was dress fed with doorknobs  Perfect Peter Lorre  Shut up asshole  Trying to do Woody  Fuck yourself  A lot of George  A lot of George  Fighting a little bit  Have you ever met a ventriloquist  That got along with his dummy?  Very tricky relationship 
[02:45:30]  They really don't like each other  But they depend on each other  I had a great fucking story  With Otto  Back in the day  Remember when me and Frankie  Came over to your house  Best deal  Oh yeah  Back at Brighton Beach  Yeah  This is when I was doing drugs  So I'm on fucking  Major fucking crack  And Frankie's on heroin  And Otto's just  Like drunk  So he lets us come over  To his house  Right  So we're sitting there  Just all wired  And we're hungry  And Otto just has like  One can of beans  And he cooks us beans  And uh 
[02:46:00]  Nobody puked  I remember there was puking  That was Frankie  Because he was on heroin  Frankie was on heroin  And then we  We're sitting there all wired  And Otto would nod out  And then pop up  And go  Fuck Messina  Like these are big people  In the business  Remember  Fuck Harry Grant  Yeah  I remember  I remember we went to one spot  Where you were  Copping crack  And a guy comes out of a doorway  And he's firing a gun  And then you go  Oh that's my guy  And you walk towards the gun 
[02:46:30]  Fire  No it's cool  He knows me  As soon as that clip is empty  He's going to hook us up  I never saw a guy walk towards the gunfire  It was under like the fucking wild bunch  That's a true story  That is how important  That crack was there  Oh man he was fearless  I'm telling you  Fuck it  Walked towards the gunfire  That's my guy  He's cool  What a lunatic  What a friggin lunatic  That's my guy  Amazing that you lived  It's great  That's hilarious  That's hilarious  Who is he shooting at  Do you know 
[02:47:00]  Someone was trying to rip him off  Or something  He wasn't after me  Yeah  Wow  Remember we took Keith Barney up there  And said my sister lives  Yeah yeah  I go  Were you coming from a gig  Me Otto and this guy Keith  And I go  I gotta stop at my sister's house  Sister's house  Yeah  The 70th  Yeah  Wow she's not doing well  Yeah  Alright here we go  The double lady  A lot of people are asking these people outside the courthouse  If Michael Jackson  Jackson  Excuse me  Should stop sleeping with little boys 
[02:47:30]  Uh huh  I'm sure he doesn't need anybody's advice  I'm sure that Michael is not going to just go through this ever again  Um I'm sure he's just going to change his lifestyle and perhaps just stop helping people  Because it's causing him nothing but pain  And by helping I mean fucking little boys in the ass  He's gonna start killing them  Oh there you go  That way they can't talk  I would have loved you years ago  But they've made it  I have to kill you  I gotta choke the life out of you  But you know what gets me  This bitch shows up with beards 
[02:48:00]  Why is she the spokesperson for everybody  And Michael Jackson  He's gonna fucking cut with a birdcage  Reverend Al Sharpton got involved with this at the end  They were interviewing him yesterday  Well he was supporting Michael  During the time he was calling Tommy Mottola a racist  Remember that whole episode  And the birds were flying out of his hair  Mottola was  Wasn't he uh  Banging uh what's her name  Mariah  Mariah  Yeah  Mariah's half black 
[02:48:30]  You can't be a racist  And be uh having sex with uh  With uh black people  Cause it doesn't work  Yeah you can  It could be a fetish  I don't think you're a good racist  If you're having sex with the people that you're bad mouthing  But you know  A lot of those uh black leaders were doing just that  They had a little  That way it works  No that way it works  What did I miss  I'm talking if you're a white guy  Who can't stand black people  You're not gonna be having sex with a black girl  Yeah but it's like that whole man dingo thing 
[02:49:00]  Take it you know  You fucking  Yeah  Yeah you play slave owner  Yeah  Play slave owner  I could have you shut for that  Well what do you want to hear  We got Reverend Al Sharpton  Shows that he was innocent first  Or do you want to hear  Should he stop sleeping with boys  Uh you know we're gonna hear both of them  So start with Reverend Al  Alright we'll start with the first clip here  From Reverend Al Sharpton  I think that this is a vindication  For people that believe  That people are innocent until proven guilty 
[02:49:30]  Uh and I think that there are no winners here  I don't think there's no reason  For Michael or those opposing Michael to gloat  There's a lot of pain  A lot of hurt here  Children have been dragged into court  Michael's reputation has been damaged severely  But I think the criminal justice system  Worked this time  I think we can say  That this jury  Despite being inundated by media  Despite the fact they were not sequestered  Despite the fact they were questionable rulings by the judge  This jury said 
[02:50:00]  The evidence wasn't there  And they acquitted him  I think this is good for America  And I don't think any of us  That went on the line  Uh saying that Michael deserved the same right as any citizen  Tawana Brawley  Are celebrating tonight  Anything other than the fact that people should have the right  To be proven guilty of a crime  Even if we disagree with their life  What about you?  Michael Rosenbaum  But you know what?  They just didn't have that piece of evidence  That could tie everything together unfortunately 
[02:50:30]  What a jizz stained hairless ass  Well I'm  What does he need?  What do you need?  Yeah  Do I think he's guilty?  Of course  But everything I read about the case  They just didn't have the DNA evidence  Or any piece of evidence  That really was going to  You know  Because he's good at this  He knows what he has to do  To keep from being prosecuted  Yeah  He has these locked rooms  He's probably going to get really good gifts  For all the jurors  What is that cunt mother going to  You know  Throw their way  She has nothing to offer them  Right  They're all starstruck in LA  There's no crime  Murder's not a crime anymore 
[02:51:00]  You know  Robert Blake  What's a crime out there?  That Robert Blake thing's amazing  He's got to just shut his mouth  You got away with murder  Just go away now  Yeah  I was getting my gun from the restaurant  And when I came out  She was shot  Yeah  Oh really?  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  I was in the restaurant  I was getting my baseball bat  I came out  She was bludgeoned about the head  Yeah  I was getting my knife  At the restaurant  She was stabbed to death  The guy 
[02:51:30]  He's guilty  But yeah  People get starstruck  I watched him  He was Beretta  I know  Not guilty  Not guilty  They have no way  To convict these people out there  But it's also  Reasonable doubt  Has become  Like it seems like  The more you get DNA  And stuff  The more reasonable doubt  There becomes  But also  The defense lawyers  Are so good  At twisting that shit around  To make it sound like  It's nothing  The prosecution  Spells it out  But they're morons  That go on juries  Come on  Let's be real here 
[02:52:00]  People that actually  Don't try to get out  Of jury duty  Are fucking retards  And they're sitting there  And now  As a prosecution expert  Yeah  Oh sorry  As a prosecution expert  You're supposed to sit there  And explain  DNA  And all kinds of  This CSI  Type evidence  To these people  They don't get it  Yeah  There's one in one million  Chances  This is not the person  Yeah  Oh there's a chance  As you heard him say  There is a chance  It's absurd  And relatively speaking 
[02:52:30]  In the context of the universe  It's a huge chance  Why?  And Sharpton says  Justice will serve  What if he was guilty?  You know  They jump on the bandwagon  Every time  Yeah  No then it would have been  A grave injustice  Has been delivered  To our brother Michael  Who is still black  Under his fingernails  Yeah black people  Are probably upset  That they couldn't  You know  Rise up  And raid stores  Oh loot 
[02:53:00]  A little rioting  Yeah  Wow  But we don't get a TV  Yeah right  Can't we just riot  A little bit  I'm kind of outraged  A little  At something  Can I riot  And then give you  My outrage reason later  Yeah  I want to like  Kind of a riot layaway plan  Where I get the merchandise now  San Antonio beat Detroit  Let's riot  Yeah let's riot  We live in L.A.  More from Reverend Al Sharpton  Should he stop sleeping with boys?  I think that Michael now 
[02:53:30]  Can have time to reflect  And think  A lot of deliberate moves  As he goes forward  The question is  Jeffrey  That whether or not  It was a crime  For him to say that  Whatever my feelings  I talked to Michael  I've been to Neverland  And I've had advice  For Michael pro and con  The issue here  Was not my advice  As a minister  Or even as a man  The issue here  Was whether he committed  A crime  That should be proven  Otherwise  It was said 
[02:54:00]  A precedent  That anyone  Could make an accusation  Against any public figure  And we be  In jail  Or convicted  Just based on  Media hysteria  Rather than  Hard evidence  That was frightening  To me  About the condition  Of this trap  Soon I'm going up to heaven  On the big riverboat  George  It looks like George  Doesn't like people of color  George  You are a racist  George  That will not be tolerated 
[02:54:30]  Gentlemen  George  My god  I think you're living  In the 1800s  Yeah  What's wrong with you  Must have been carved  From an old tree  Yeah  That's gotta be it  An old riverboat  Ruining everything  Very good  It's like my peppy  Told me  I don't know  Do you want to hear  From the DA  Or a jury 
[02:55:00]  The jury foreman  Are they gonna  Convict him  No  Various jurors  One of them  Well this might be interesting  Is there gonna be  A federal case next  Yeah well  Are they gonna do  Something where  Civil rights  Usually they go  To a civil rights  Thing  If you lose  The criminal case  You violated  Their civil rights  Yeah  Well won't they sue  A civil lawsuit  Like that's what  Yeah  OJ was acquitted  Of killing her  But they  They cleaned him out  Yeah they said that  Oh they didn't clean him out  They can't take any money 
[02:55:30]  Out of his football pension  Which is all he's living on  Yeah  And that's Florida law  And that's all he needs  So he lives on that  He doesn't work  He goes out  Hangs out with friggin sluts  At parties all night  God it's a sick world  It really is  But they took his  Heisman Trophy  Can you imagine  Having that around the house  His Heisman  Like he cares  Like he even cares  He got away with murder  But they couldn't take his money  Out of his bank account  Or  No they could  His assets  I don't think he had anything  Really at that point  I think he had it all  You know  Yeah  His lawyers took everything 
[02:56:00]  Spent on the legal fees  Yeah what was left  And then he gets  What he gets from a pension  He's got a huge pension  That comes in  That they can't touch  And that's it  So he lives his life  He screws broads  Now though he's  He's like older  You don't realize  How long ago  That whole case was  Yeah  It's old OJ  And he can barely walk anymore  Yeah  So I guess these girls  Feel safe  You'd be chasing him  With a knife  And just kind of  Limping along  In slow motion  Screw you OJ  Fun to watch  All right  We got  What kind of  Mother lets her son  Sleep with men 
[02:56:30]  One of the jurors  As a parent  You know  It's something that  You are constantly  Every moment of your day  You're protective  Over what happens  To your children  And I guess I might be  Speaking maybe  For myself  And a few others  Jurors  That you know  What mother  In her right mind  Would allow  That to happen  Or you know  Just freely 
[02:57:00]  Volunteer your child  You know  To sleep with someone  And not just so much  Michael Jackson  But any person  For that matter  So that's something  You know  That mothers  I think  Are naturally  Concerned with  I'm glad they do  Me and Opie  Wouldn't have girlfriends  If that was the case  But the mother  Wasn't  Wow  The mother  Wasn't on trial  She's saying  The mother  You know  That's what  This fucking story 
[02:57:30]  The mother  Was not on  Fucking trial  Okay so the mother  Is wrong  The mother is wrong  Yeah  It depends how you look at it  Yeah what's the worst sin  Right  But that's  Diverting attention  To what Michael Jackson  The truth of the matter  Is the mother  Could have sent  The kid there  With every intention  On extorting money  From Michael Jackson  Hey I'm going to send him there  Michael Jackson  Is going to sleep with him  I'm going to extort money  Out of him  It doesn't matter  What her motives are  Try her for something else  The bottom line is  He was  With the son  Doing things 
[02:58:00]  He shouldn't have been doing  Yeah  And that's your jury  And if she tries  To spin a buck out of it  That's her sick problem  It doesn't make him innocent  You notice how I pointed that out  I noticed that  Very smart  But it is interesting  That all the  In the papers  And everything  They didn't like the mother  That is really what  It comes down to  You see the feisty  79 year old woman  Don't snap your fingers  Don't  I was thinking  Don't snap your fingers  At me lady  Oh  Stop it  Break a hip  For that kind of money  I'm sending my two daughters  Over in bikinis 
[02:58:30]  With fucking rupees  Put it in his drink  Turn on the tape recorder  Wow  That are all cunts  Including my mother  And a virgin Mary  Wow  George  Why  Oh are you inappropriate  Today George  God  He is surly  Taking this freedom  A little too far there  This satellite radio  Where he could say anything  My goodness  His cheeks are very rosy  Potty mouth  Potty mouth  Yeah  Did Cedric play a good 
[02:59:00]  Ralph Cramden  I didn't see the movie  I didn't see it  I just was angry  That they even made it  Come on  I wouldn't even want to see  Gleason and Carney  Do a feature film  It was a great  Black and white TV show  It was a work of art  Leave it alone  We're so with you  We were enraged  When we first heard about it  And then to find out  They barely  It shouldn't be called  The Honeymooners at all  Because it had nothing to do  Really with the TV show  Yeah  At all  Did you see the later ones  They made in the 60's  With I think Meredith McRae  Yeah  They're singing  Yeah  They're singing  And it was in color  And it was  Oh  Awful 
[02:59:30]  Like cringe  You can't even watch  Gleason  I don't like seeing  Great clowns get old  You know like the later  Like Marx Brothers movies  I want to see them  At that time  When they were  You know  Three Stooges  When they're all gray  Yeah  And they just look  Dangerous  It looks dangerous  For them to be  Hitting each other  Yeah  With their graham cracker hips  Well everything  Everything is stolen  Kojak  Yeah  Kojak  Look at  Ving Rhames  Is a great actor  He doesn't have to  Like he sucks on a lollipop  That's going to sell the show  It's nothing to do with Kojak

[03:05:30]  Yeah  Bonnie was there  On the test drive  I got in  And it smelled  Like mildew  And I said to the guy  Oh it's got a funky smell  And he goes  Oh you know what that is  He had some like  Ukrainian act  Yeah  That is a sauerkraut  In the trunk  And he pulled over  And sure enough  He had like this huge  Box of sauerkraut  In the trunk  And he puts it  In the trunk  For a reason  Yeah he put it  In case they ask  I'm going to have  Because the thing stinks  And he's able to say now  Because the sauerkraut  In the trunk  Why the fuck  Do you have a sauerkraut  Like the car  Went off a pier 
[03:06:00]  At some point  Yeah that's probably  What happened  It got flooded  Got soaked  Somehow  Fell into a lake  And then he had  Cabasso  Or whatever  What's it called  Cabasso  Cabasso  Cabasso  I don't know  What you called  Famous sumo wrestler  Cabasso  I got a  Say sausage  Say Polish sausage  Yeah  Wow  How does that work  Do you meet him  Like under a bridge  With the car  I mean does he  Bring it to you  Well no  I was in the house  I was at  I was working  Florida  It was a car dealer  Shooting the gun 
[03:06:30]  He knows this guy  I know  This is my guy  I was just looking  On eBay at cars  And this one  So happened to be  In Fort Lauderdale  Where I was going  The next week  Right  So on eBay  It really looked clean  There's a link somewhere  Someone has it on  So it looked nice  On eBay  Shiny  Didn't look dented  Beautiful  Not dented  It looked like a nice  Have you seen it  I saw the picture  Yeah  It's not a bad looking car  I mean if you had that car  You know  A little status  A status  You know what Keith Robinson said  He goes  Does it come with a Tommy gun  Tommy gun 
[03:07:00]  Right on the  Bonnie and Voss  Right on the running boards  Bonnie and Voss  That's hilarious  It smelled like kielbosco  Kielbosco  Right  What the hell is kielbosco  Whatever  I don't eat red meat  Oh my god  It's not red meat  Really  Oh brother  It's everything but the red meat  So now you saw it  And figured you're going down there  But  My god  This is such a good deal  That someone's going to scoop it up  Before I get there 
[03:07:30]  So I better put a deposit  Yes because  Here's what it was  And can I just say this  I said to him  Don't do it  Many times  This is the first time  I'm saying I told you so  Ah  Good  But it was really  Yeah it was irritating  Well I'm just  Get used to that feeling  Of irritation  The more of this is coming your way  When you say  I do  I do  I'm irritated  I'm just trying to get  A second car for you  This wasn't really for me  Yeah and then he kept  Trying to say it was for me  This whole thing  That he was doing  Don't do me any favors 
[03:08:00]  Here's the thing  You see  I see it on the internet  And I'm looking at it  It was like 26  Right  26 large  26  Yeah  So everything's excellent  I go to  Everything's  Then I go to  Like you know  Not a blue book  You know whatever  Because they didn't have  Blue book for that year  That low  So  But  It said 44,000  Oh  Well  50,000 in main condition  You're ahead of the game  Right from the start  I'm saying  I'm going to take it home  Drive it a couple months  And sell it  Make like 15 grand  Turn it over 
[03:08:30]  Turn it over  But I've never done that before  So I'm  You know  It could have been a  It could have backfired  Of course  When he was trying to get  The deposit back  He kept saying to the guy  On the phone  But I wanted to make money  Off of this car  Oh god  That's his excuse  That's an excuse  That was like  Why he should get his money  And the guy's like  Yeah I did the same thing  And I made a grand already  Yeah  But don't make it  Don't make it sound like  Oh he got it from eBay  eBay is nothing but classifieds  On the computer  That's all right

[03:09:30]  Come on  Well  People aren't  Counterfeiting  Designer everything  Well that's true  But here's the thing  There's certain ways  To tell  Like the buttons  Why would someone  Be selling them cheap?  How  How would they  Legitimately  Be selling it cheap?  Because I bought  Golf clubs  I bought  Golf clubs  Because they don't  A golf shop  Is paying high rent  Overhead  And these places  Sell them out of a  Garage  Out of a warehouse  Where they just have 
[03:10:00]  Boxes of it  So there's no overhead  That's cutting out  The middle man  Okay  He explained it to me already  Okay  I heard that  You knew the  Cutting out the middle man  Thing there Bonnie  Okay  You know  You gotta know  How to get deals  Alright  You go to AA meetings  You find guys  Whose marriages  Aren't working  Or you get a ring  Things happen  You gotta know  How to make them happen  Get a bargain  Right  So the rolls  Is on there  You see it  It looks good online  So you call the guy up  Yeah  And you say  I'm interested in the car

[03:21:00]  Striking lad  Oh  Thank you  Faggot  I'm going to watch a cornhole  Around the blonde one  Remember when we used to work  For Mike Lofton  Yeah  He died  He died?  Yeah  You're kidding me  Get out of here  How did it happen?  He fucking didn't pay me one night  We were working  Who is this guy?  This guy Mike  Oh didn't you grab his TV?  I took his TV  Yeah  Because we did a gig  You're a thug  I was working in a hotel 
[03:21:30]  And then  He was kicked out of his house  He had all this shit in the hotel room  And we're at  He doesn't pay  I go  I'm not leaving  With nothing  I fucking took his TV  It lasted for 8-9 years  It was a good TV  What a parasite shyster he was  Wasn't he?  Yeah  I kind of liked him  Even though he was fucking us  Every time we worked  Like I used to do Club Binet  And he would get $500 to hire me  He goes  You want Otto and George?  It's $500  Then he would call me  And he goes  I got a gig  It's $75 if you want to do it 
[03:22:00]  Oh man  And he would keep  Yeah  Four and a quarter for him  And I would get $75  What a scumbag  Yeah  I had like an idiot  Froning me  Like an eighth of coke  And I owe him the money  And I go back to his house  I go  Look  I sold it on credit  Can I get another eighth?  This fucking guy gave me  A quarter ounce of coke on credit  Ugh  Something killed me  I don't know how many  Shickings I did to work that off  Oh I was going to say  You never actually handed him  Money back did you?  Never  Never  No way  Anthony 
[03:22:30]  Another death at Disney  Oh I saw this  Yeah we were talking about it earlier  And this is one of our  Ongoing things  That you know  This happens all the time  But the public doesn't really  Get to hear about it really  Because they're really good  At covering this crap up  Well it gets into the news  But the people at the park  That's what I mean  They really never know  What's going on  The ride closes  They hose it down  They're back  The music's playing again  Did they say what ride it was?  Was this Space Mountain?  Not Space Mountain  No it's this new one  At Epcot Mission Space 
[03:23:00]  Oh okay  Now this one is fucked up  And what they usually do  At the ride  They just have a sign  Like clothes for maintenance  Yeah  Clothes for maintenance  Meaning they got to get  That big huge hose out  And hose it down  Get rid of all the blood  Get a head out of the spoke  Get their Disney Imagineers  To imagine how they're going to  Get that head out of there  Vic Morrow tilt the world  Enjoy  Enjoy  Maybe they have to get a coat of paint  On the ride 
[03:23:30]  Cover some stuff up  Oh did a kid get flown out of there  Or something?  No this is a four year old boy  Vacationing with his family  Died on Mission Space  At Disney  Apparently he passed out on the ride  And then they got the paramedics  And they were taking him to the hospital  And he died  There was some lady letting dogs out  Going what kind of parents  Puts their kids on rides  Yeah  Mission Space  Visitors report that the ride is intense 
[03:24:00]  It simulates a rocket blast off  Air sickness bags are provided for the visitors  Just like Voss' act  A little air sickness bag  Who would go on a ride  And they give you air sickness bags?  Well this one is  What four year old on that?  This one  Yeah  Now bring in your four year old on this  This just goes to show you  People really don't understand these rides  Especially the newer ones  That go on these simulations and stuff  You could get into one of these little boxes  And they show a movie on the front of the box  And then it tilts  And kind of gives you this illusion  That you're moving  I hate those rides man 
[03:24:30]  They have one called Star Tours  Yeah  And the Back to the Future ride is another one  And they're pretty cool  I like the Back to the Future ride  That's wild  You really get this whole  You feel like you're flying in this vehicle  But you don't go anywhere  You don't  You're up on what amounts to stilts  In this thing  Hydraulics  Yeah  And it throws you around  Yeah  And if the screen makes it look like you're turning right  They'll tilt the car  So you feel like G's pulling you to one side  It's a pretty cool idea  Well this one 
[03:25:00]  They put you in this Mission Space thing  And it works on a centrifuge  So you're in this thing  You're looking at this image  Again this simulation film playing in front of you  And when you lift off  This thing starts spinning  And you feel the G's now pushing you back  It's like pressure on your chest  Your head  And you're pushed into the seat  Backwards  And how safe that is for certain people  Maybe if you've got a heart problem  A brain problem  Or if you're a four year old child  With growing organs 
[03:25:30]  Well there's a  Perhaps you shouldn't  No concept of what's going on  Yeah  There's a height requirement of 44 inches  On Michael's lap  He doesn't even have to push  The kid just squeezes right on it  Close the park today  Man  Yeah  There's a height requirement  The kid made the height requirement  But he's four  And then you get a Snoopy toe tag  Oh my god Otto  Oh my god  You think they got those at the morgue  You should  Little colorful Snoopy toe tag  For his little toe  I gotta tell you 
[03:26:00]  Snoopy's not a Disney character  Oh  That's okay  The hospital isn't Disney  Little kid  I gotta tell you  George usually kills on this program  But today it's Otto killing  Yeah  Killing  Otto's killing George  Making you look silly  Like Mission Space  Dan Rowan but less dead  Oh that's awful  I've never gone on a fast ride again  When I was a kid  I went up  My mother put me on one  And I threw up spaghetti  On everybody  And it didn't even look like  It was chewed 
[03:26:30]  That's how it came out  Like big  Just spaghetti was flying  All over me  And the people behind me  Oh god  Just ruining their little  Day at the beach  Ruining everything  My mother screaming  Stop the ride  Fucking spaghetti  What were you in a teacup  Projectile comedy  No bumper cars  I don't use a teacup ride  I don't go on anything  It spins around  Nothing that goes upside down  None of that shit  Fuck that  I like  The most thrill I want on a ride  Is like  It's a small world  Sit in the boat  Look at the little  Dummies 
[03:27:00]  No offense  Kind of looks like him  From the  It's a small world ride  Oh is that it  I have a profile  On the condom  There's nothing wrong with this  Just sit in the boat  Ride starts  55 minutes later  You come out the other end  After listening to this song  Screaming  20 times  Make it stop  Turn it off  In every  They do it in every language  Is what they do  And then you go around  And there's little  Japanese puppets  Boing  Chang  Chang  Chang 
[03:27:30]  Dang  Dang  Dang  Little Al-Qaeda puppets  Slowly sawing off  Other children's heads  Great  It's wonderful  Awful ride  Did you hear about that  Black guy's leg  Landing in the house  In Queen  You must have had a riot  With that thing  Right  Oh of course  The African  This guy decided  He was going to stow away  In a jetliner  From Africa to New York  And apparently  He got in the works  Because when the landing gear doors 
[03:28:00]  Opened over Long Island  Parts of his body  Came spilling out of the  Wheel well  Frozen black leg  With an Adidas sneaker  Landing on the roof  Without an Adidas sneaker  It wasn't just his leg  It was part of his  It was his leg  His hip  And a little bit of his torso  With a piece of a spine  And it crashed through  This woman's garage roof  And then fell on the lawn  And she heard a big bang  Went out there  And there was a  Yeah  A leg with a sneaker  Perfectly tied on it  Who gets the miles? 
[03:28:30]  That is some clean up  But they said  When the plane did land  They figured it out  That it came from that plane  And then  There was a delay  And they wouldn't tell  The passengers  They just said  Oh it's delayed  For maintenance  While he  Hosed the black guy  Out of the wheel well  Oh he was dead  Oh please  You don't get a leg  In half your spine  And then go  Okay can I get  My connecting flight  I'm going to Pittsburgh  Where the hell  Do you think  The guy  Yeah where's my  Standard baggage claim  Where's my leg  They always lose my leg 
[03:29:00]  The guy's dead  Yes he's dead  The guy was dead  When they left the runway  Yeah  Dead dead dead  Squeezed up in the gears  And we left  That's great  There's no security  How do you just walk  Into a place  And climb into a  Like when we went  To Amsterdam last  Last week  They don't check anything  You just walk in  They look at your  It's Africa  You ride a zebra  Up to the wheel  And you jump in  What the hell  Kind of airport  Is it Africa  It's not like JFK 
[03:29:30]  No  You find out  Where your baggage  Thing is  By listening to drums  Oh 25  Oh I take this one down  Please  Jesus  Squirt some sauerkraut  In the boarding pass  Exactly  In your sauerkraut  What was it  Kielbasa  Kielbasa  Kielbasa  Great Kielbasa  That's the guy's name  That fell out of the wheel  Well  Kielbasa

[03:36:30]  How it's hard to swallow I guess  Again or a different one  No there's a different one  Is she always talking about jizz  And how you're not supposed to swallow it  Oh this one's about  Improving the taste of semen  That's what you want to hear  Grandma talk about  Do a lot of drugs before you  Suck it  I find it really disgusting  Is there anything that he can do  To make it taste better  That I can do  Yeah give up meat  Give up meat  Meat  Vegetarians  Veggins  Who only eat  Fruits and vegetables  Veggins  Their ejaculate is sweet 
[03:37:00]  And nut like  Whereas males who eat meat  Nut like  It's all nut like lady  Their ejaculate tastes bitter  Like burnt leather  Okay  Okay so tell him  If he wants you to swallow  He's got to give up meat  Burnt leather  Okay thank you  Otherwise you're not going to do it  Okay thank you  Okay Julie  Bye bye  Bye bye  Well uh  Veggins  Have a sweeter  Jizz  Isn't that something  For me to get her to swallow  I tell her she's co-headlining  Snoopy's not a Disney character 
[03:37:30]  Shut up  I can't believe it took that long  Because the minute it came out of my mouth  I was like  George is  I couldn't help it  Very angry  This morning  More angry than usual  Yeah  Alright well you learned something new there  Don't eat meat  It'll taste like burnt leather  Oh here she talks about bondage  Does she know this from experience?  I don't know  Because anytime she gives sex advice  You just picture this old broad on her knees 
[03:38:00]  Just huffing  Oh  It's like burnt leather back in the 30's  You know  That's playing in the background  Hubba hubba  You're quite a broad  Why did Voss have to run out of the studio?  He got a phone call  Oh  Could be something important  You'll tell us later?  No  It's not  It was Gideon  It was in Paris Hilton was it?  We got last time someone had to take a phone call in the studio  Paris Hilton called here?  He called  Called someone that was on the air with us 
[03:38:30]  The guy from  The singer from Corrosion of Conformity  Yeah  Called up  I'm wondering if you made that up though  You got a picture of her on the phone  That's true  Alright here's the old grandma talking about bondage  Relationship  Oh  How do you feel about a little bit of a whipping?  A little nervous I guess  I bet you  You've never talked about this before  It just came out of the blue  After four years of going out  And all of a sudden she said that she'd like to 
[03:39:00]  Now does she want to start off by tying you up?  Yeah  Yeah  Handcuffed  Handcuffed  Behind your back  Yep  Hands to ankles  No  To the bed  She's a mountie  What kind of handcuffs?  Yeah mountie handcuffs  What other kind you get up there eh?  Let me tell ya  You know  Yeah so I'm thinking maybe we ought to you know use the cuffs  Cause that's what I'm all about  Shut up  I think they were  Canadians  You think they were the real handcuffs or the plastic ones  Where you have to be like  Oh  I'm all 
[03:39:30]  I'm cuffed  I'm cuffed  Do what you will  She tickles you  You can break them and punch them in the face  Knock it off  Why don't you try  Make a deal with her  In the beginning  Rather than handcuffs  Cause handcuffs are scary  They're metal  And you're really locked in there  It's just the idea that you're really locked in there  How about  She just ties you up with  An old silk scarf  Or a nylon pantyhose  There's gotta be some use for old runs  And I could choke her with it later 
[03:40:00]  A money nylon pantyhose  Tie you up  Just tie you up  Well I just watched the show 8mm last night eh?  Eh?  That is a sick movie too  Slow down buddy  Oh great  He's bringing up Nicolas Cage movies  Slow down  I just watched 8mm eh?  Eh?  That's a twisted movie  That was a sexy movie  You know  I'm thinking of killing people  And putting it on a film eh? 
[03:40:30]  Cool  Could have been a great movie  If it wasn't Nicolas Cage in it  Have you seen that yet?  No  It's all about that kind of stuff  And how did you feel?  How did you feel while you were watching it?  I'm a little very scared  Okay  Very scared  Do you trust your girlfriend?  Yes I trust her  Would she hurt you?  I don't think so  Okay  I don't think so  Can you tell her that you're scared?  Yeah I did  And she got a little upset  Why did she get upset?  What did she say?  Because  She wants to do this badly  Okay 
[03:41:00]  But I think she should understand  That you don't want to do it badly  Granny's out of her league  You're badly scared  She's definitely in over ahead on this one  Now the other concern is  That you don't know  If she goes from tying you up  And handcuffs  What else is she going to want to do?  Oh they're going to do  Yeah  Bring in a black guy  And have sex with him in front of you  After you're chained to the bed  Hey I'm into the  Oh I'm not attracted to that  If you're very scared  And this is something that you just can't  Then the relationship in all probability will end 
[03:41:30]  Because it's you know  It's going nowhere  It's not going to work out  Between the two of you  Okay thanks very much for your call  Hope we can solve that one a little bit  She had nothing on that  You had nothing  She could tell how to diddle  Or how to like you know  Suck a dick  But when it comes to  A little bondage  She's lost  I remember on the plantation  We used to have a little bondage  We hobble our negroes
