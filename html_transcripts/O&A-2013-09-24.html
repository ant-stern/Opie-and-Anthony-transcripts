<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with the hosts' usual banter, including Anthony's boasts about his wealth and sexual exploits.  This segued into Anthony recounting an embarrassing experience as an air keyboardist in an air band, performing songs by The Who, The Clash, and Led Zeppelin.  The show then focused heavily on a missed opportunity to photograph Metallica, with Jimmy Norton expressing significant frustration at not getting a picture with the band despite efforts from others.  Norton detailed his interactions with some band members, ultimately receiving a group photo lacking James Hetfield. This led into a discussion of a Twitter feud Norton had with a fan who criticized him for prioritizing the Metallica photo over a cancer benefit, escalating into a public exchange of insults.  A lengthy discussion followed concerning the "knockout game," its prevalence, particularly among young black males, and the media's portrayal, interwoven with callers’ accounts, statistics, and the hosts' personal experiences navigating New York City. The segment ended with Opie’s dislike of Lucky Charms and a recent discovery of fake tuna in a sushi restaurant.

The show continued with a segment centered around widespread fish fraud in New York City, specifically the mislabeling of tuna,  with a caller, Mike, providing details on industry practices like gas-flushing yellowfin tuna.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to a Kenyan mall hostage situation, followed by graphic descriptions of various historical and contemporary execution methods, including accounts of Ottoman cannon executions and a recent cartel execution video.  A bizarre incident involving a remote-controlled helicopter killing someone was also discussed.  This segment included an interview with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich promoting his IMAX film, interspersed with the hosts' tangents, including a near-rape experience in Buffalo and discussions of skydiving, bungee jumping, and a South American vine-jumping ritual. The homeowner from a bizarre news story about a house damaged at a teenager's party, Brian Holloway, also appeared.


The show moved on to a discussion about a caller, Brian, whose house was vandalized, leading to speculation about his financial situation and rumors of domestic abuse from his neighbor.  This transitioned into a satirical commentary on Burger King's "Satisfries."  The hosts then recounted a recent in-studio visit by Tony Danza, lamenting missed opportunities for autographs, sharing a humorous anecdote involving semen on a shirt and a discussion about penis size comparisons with Danza.  The show then welcomed Stephen Merchant, who described accidentally walking through a window at Sarah Silverman's house after consuming edibles.  Merchant promoted his show, "Hello Ladies," and shared anecdotes about dating, awkward teenage encounters, and experiences with pornography, including graphic details about his and the hosts’ first sexual experiences. One host shared a disturbing story about his father facilitating his first sexual encounter at age 13 or 14.  The segment ended with Merchant's arrival and a promise of more guests.


The next segment continued with Stephen Merchant discussing a disturbing childhood experience involving sexual encounters with a woman who also had a relationship with his father.  This transitioned into a discussion about teacher-student relationships and generational differences in acceptable behavior.  Merchant also mentioned a childhood friend attempting oral sex on him. James Kahn then joined, promoting his show "Back in the Game," describing its racy content.  He discussed funny on-set moments with child actors. Finally, musician Warren Haynes promoted his album "Shout," discussing his weight loss, songwriting process, touring challenges, and performed the song "When the World Gets Small" live. The hosts discussed air guitar and the differences between Haynes' solo work and his work with Government Mule.


A further segment featured more conversation with Warren Haynes, including his songwriting process and regret over past work. He performed "Captured" (with Jim James) and another unnamed song from "Shout."  The conversation then shifted to Art Bell, focusing on his open-mindedness towards paranormal callers’ stories.  A substantial portion involved discussions about furries, their sexual practices, and experiences at furry conventions, with callers sharing anecdotes.  The discussion also touched upon bronies and their sexual practices. The show concluded with promotion of a Black Label Society DVD, "Unblackened," a mention of Lizzy Kaplan as a future guest, and giveaways of a signed Government Mule CD and a Walking Dead Blu-ray.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What? Where did we live with us?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony?  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang open-handed, only he's dang open-handed.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Yes, good morning everybody. 
[00:01:00]  Rawr, rawr, rawr.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hi audience.  Hi people.  Hi fans.  Wee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee.  Oh.  A little air guitar.  Yeah, but I couldn't...  I wasn't good enough for the air guitar.  No?  Remember.  Yeah, air keyboard.  That's what I was talking about.  I was air keyboard.  Wow.  I guess I gave a lot of people the chills of the douche variety yesterday.  Some of the douchiest of chills.  Sometimes it sucks sharing on this radio show.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Look, we all have those little things.  Yes, we do.  But usually you push them down, you're like, ah, it would be best no one knows about this  one.  And most people have the ability to do that.  Right.  To not talk about some of the embarrassing things in their life, but we have to.  Well, I mean, we've been at this so long.  I mean, some days you're reaching, you've got to find those little nuggets.  They're in no secret.  It's so nice to have no secrets, though.  It really is, because it's so freeing.  There's nothing anyone could really approach me with and say, like, ah, I know this about 
[00:02:00]  you, Anthony.  It's like, I've said it all.  But it makes you look like a douchebag sometimes.  Well, yeah.  Now everyone knows I was a fucking...  Air keyboard player.  Oh, thank you.  I thought you were going to call me, you know, way worse.  Faggot.  No, that was...  Quay.  Something's just...  Pussy.  Some things just speak for themselves.  Talking about me being an air keyboardist.  Yeah, keyboardist.  And very douchey, because he was just air guitaring again for me. 
[00:02:30]  Well, you know, because I liked it.  Because I'm hoping some of those air bands out there maybe acknowledge that I could maybe  be the lead guitarist in an air band instead of the keyboard player.  That's what makes that story way worse.  The fact that it's a band...  Half the time, I just had to kind of sit there.  Oh, God.  Yeah, what if there's no keyboards in it?  Do you play an air tambourine?  Actually, it was...  You just break one out?  Actually, it was Won't Get Fooled Again.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right, right.  Where I had to do that...  I just had to sit there with one finger... 
[00:03:00]  But I moved like this.  I moved.  Fucking working the crowd as my one finger's hitting the fake non-existing keyboard.  Dude, you should have talked him into doing some Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  Right.  You could have fucking...  Three tiers of fucking keyboards all around you.  Elton John.  Yeah.  Elton John.  But I was just there with the...  Yeah.  And then fucking lead guitarist just waiting for that fucking chord hit.  Damn!  Damn!  Block of Seagulls.  You could have done that.  No, man. 
[00:03:30]  We were rock gods.  Wow.  Classic rock.  In the air band fucking world.  Yeah.  It was the Clash.  It was the Who.  It was Zeppelin.  But...  Hence the keyboard player.  It's not around a lot during Zeppelin.  I bet.  Just watch them rock.  I had to watch them rock.  It's an art form to watch the rest of your air band.  Is it?  Yes.  Dude, why not just play an extra air guitar?  Yeah, why not?  It's not like you're going to feed back.  You wouldn't allow me.  I wasn't allowed.  I would have switched instruments right in the middle of the show.  I was just flattered that I was recruited. 
[00:04:00]  Wow.  You know.  I think it was only one gig, though.  One gig.  What do you think?  I'm not positive.  That's so terrible.  That's so terrible.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  Well, well.  Hi, Jimmy.  We're back.  Hi, guys.  After yesterday's program.  Yes.  The Metallica.  How great was Tony Dan?  I felt really bad not talking to him.  He seemed amazing, right?  He was fun.  He's a fun dude, man.  He's just a nice guy.  How would you know? 
[00:04:30]  You left us.  I know.  Well, I hadn't first heard of me.  You left us.  All day I thought of what interview he likes me in.  I wasn't even made with my Patton Oswalt.  Someone else.  You left us to try to get the Metallica picture.  Yeah, I had to play that one out.  A lot of people don't know what happened.  They don't even know what happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they might not follow us on Twitter.  Maybe they didn't listen to the after show yesterday.  We kind of left them hanging on the regular show.  I didn't even address it on Twitter.  When I walked out of here, was there a hustle and a bustle out in the lobby area?  It was very crowded. 
[00:05:00]  Something had just happened.  It looked like people were talking.  Right.  And I saw Florentine there.  Yep.  He was talking with...  Young Sam Roberts was out there.  Yeah, yeah.  And Club Soda Kenny and Roland.  And everyone was on high alert and very, very nervous.  And from everybody that I had spoken to as I was leaving, the scuttlebutt in the lobby  was all about Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  They weren't nervous because Metallica was in the building.  They were very nervous because they were all trying to get Jimmy's picture with Metallica. 
[00:05:30]  And it had already happened or not happened.  Right.  But that's what everyone was talking about.  When I walked up, I saw Florentine.  He was standing there.  Yeah.  And he looked at me and he just shook his head.  He shook his head, no.  And just went, oh.  Oh, like, it didn't happen.  It did not happen.  Yes.  So walk us through it after you left during the Tony Danza.  Well, I didn't know how long they'd be in Howard's studio.  So we were hanging outside.  I just wanted to eat up preparedness like a good Boy Scout.  Yes.  I wanted to be prepared.  And there was just a lot of standing around and speculating. 
[00:06:00]  There wasn't much that could be done until they walked out of the...  I was actually...  I didn't want to just stand there and look at Howard's studio.  So I was standing back a little bit, but I was, like, looking into the fishbowl.  But the reflection...  Oh, my God.  I could see the door.  So this is what I looked like I was casually chatting.  That's not crazy at all.  No.  Jim, actually, we had left during a break to take a piss or whatever.  And Jim was the only one in here.  And Sam handed Jimmy some copy. 
[00:06:30]  And Jim is reading the commercial.  As he's reading the spot, he's scrolling through his phone, looking for that...  Waiting for that text to come through.  Have to be there.  Yes.  Yes.  So it was paramount.  I knew this one wouldn't...  I mean, it was...  I wasn't pissed about it, though, because people tried to make it happen.  It wasn't like anybody was a dick about it.  It was one of those things where they all just came in separately.  Yeah.  And they all just left separately.  Well, sure.  But that's...  I guarantee they don't hang out anymore. 
[00:07:00]  Who was the first guy to leave?  Kirk Hammett.  So as soon as I was standing out there...  When you saw Kirk, though, leaving, were you thinking like,  Ha!  I gotta keep him!  No, I knew, though.  Because when Kirk...  It wasn't like...  When Kirk Hammett walked out, he's walked out with this...  He's a big, bald guy.  I forget his name.  He works for them.  Who I've seen a million times with them.  He's always with Kirk or James.  He's got a big...  He's a big boy.  And when I saw him walking Kirk out, I knew they were going right down.  Out of the elevator.  He'd go, hey, asshole!  Yeah, but it was like, the guy's just leaving. 
[00:07:30]  And then...  So I just said, fuck it.  And I just went and got my stuff in here.  And when I came out, James had just left.  Like, you just missed James.  I'm like, I didn't care about seeing them individually.  And then I went to hop in the elevator, and Rob Trujillo got on the bassist.  So I went up talking to him.  And he was just...  He's just a great guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I appreciated people trying.  What are you going to do?  I didn't feel that bad, because there's no way I could have...  It was like, no one was a dick about it.  Right.  It was like, it was like they took a bunch of pictures and just didn't include little  Jimmy.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Are you relieved today, though?  Now that it's over officially?  I'll tell you what made me...  Because you've been working on this for about three days.  But I got the picture.  Roland sent me the picture last night that we all took.  Right.  And it bummed me out that James wasn't there.  Oh, it's so obvious it's a wasted picture.  I saw mine.  I'm like, yeah, without it, this doesn't really work.  Because it's a beautiful picture.  It doesn't work, though.  It's a fucking beautiful picture.  Like, they took the serious...  Whoever did photography...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...took beautiful fucking photos.  Oh, I saw the Sam Roberts one.  What is it?  No.  Lars' head.  Like, that's a perfect photo.  I mean, without... 
[00:08:30]  Of course, James isn't there, but that's how you want a band photo.  I tweeted it last night.  Lars' head is turning into the bad guy from Tango and Cash.  Yeah.  That big jaw guy.  Yes.  He really is.  And only love for Sam Roberts in that picture.  I heard, um, AIDS, uh, You're a Mutant, um, yeah, plenty of love from the fans.  Oh, that's nice.  AIDS!  And it's always, yeah, it always hurts when men don't find you attractive. 
[00:09:00]  Yes, yes.  Whenever men have a problem with your looks, your hair, your shoes, your clothes, anything.  Oh, it really just busts me up.  It's just a little creepy.  Yeah.  We had our own, um, running with, um, not running, but our James Hetfield sighting.  Oh, boy.  When we went downstairs, you know, went downstairs, and, uh, there was a fan standing there, and  he had some pictures and whatnot, and he goes, oh, guys, big fan, can I take a picture?  And he had a buddy with him, so he hands his buddy the camera.  We were, we, we were feeling good. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, look at us getting, oh.  So we recognize, and someone wants our picture.  Yeah.  We stand there, just, I mean, ready to snap, and he goes, there's James, and he goes, whoa,  and runs off.  He goes, he goes, yeah, he goes, I gotta get James.  I gotta get James.  And he walks up to James, he's like, James, could you just sign this?  And James is just, like, not even acknowledging him.  Just walking.  I don't like that at all, man, and I'll tell you why.  There was no one else around. 
[00:10:00]  I've seen it a bunch, and we're lucky enough to be in this spot where we see celebrities  leave, and they're leaving in an area where there's no real fans around at all.  I mean, outside the building's a whole different story.  This guy happened to be in the lobby, and it would have taken James fucking five seconds  tops to take a quick picture with this guy, and not only did he not take the picture,  he just kept walking, and he was kind of just nodding at the guy, but more like looking  for the door and get the fuck out.  I saw Lady Gaga do that shit, and a few others. 
[00:10:30]  It's like, I saw Miley Cyrus do that.  Did you think that guy was, uh...  Because we leave with a lot of the celebrities, because everyone's ending at the same time.  That guy seemed like an eBay guy.  That's what I was going to ask you, and they didn't seem like...  Because he had pictures in his hands, a folder.  Whatever.  A folder?  Yeah, they got a lot of those guys.  Whatever, man.  Whatever.  If we are lucky enough to be that famous, I don't give a fuck a...  Someone makes a few bucks on eBay off of a photograph.  Yeah, I think a lot of those guys hate them.  Like, I think they don't, uh...  I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, I think they just hate them, motherfuckers.  Yeah, they hate them.  He was looking for a picture, though.  So that's...  Was he?  Yeah.  I heard it signed.  Someone told me he tried to get James to sign.  I heard that story about James.  I didn't hear about you guys.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can't help me.  Then me and Anna are standing there.  We watch him run after James a little, and then we're just like...  And we're like, fuck this.  Fuck this guy.  We're waiting around.  So he didn't get a James picture or a signature, and he didn't get our picture.  Fuck him.  We just left at that point.  We're like, fuck, we're not waiting around now as he tries to get something off Headfield. 
[00:11:30]  Waiting with our arms still out for him to come in there so they're around him.  Look, a lot of celebrities do that.  I don't like it.  I've seen it with my own eyes.  I'm sure they have their reasoning, their reasons, whatever, but it's just, I don't  know, man.  I understand if they're walking through a busy area and they stop, that could be a problem  because then everyone's like, oh, fuck, who's that?  Oh, fuck, I need a picture, too.  Then everyone starts swarming, but when you know it's only one or two guys and no one else 
[00:12:00]  is around, I don't see what the harm is, really.  I heard on the Sam Roberts After Show yesterday that Jim Florentine was on it, and Jim said  every time the Howard area door opened, he saw flashes going off from people taking pictures  with Metallica.  But it might not have been Metallica.  I'm sure they took band pictures, but after that show ended, because I think Scott knows 
[00:12:30]  Lars pretty well, because Lars was the last one out, and then after James left, it was  Trujillo left, and then Lars was still in there when I left.  So I imagine they were back there all talking.  I don't imagine they were just standing there for a long, taking a bunch of as Metallica  pictures.  And if they were, they were, but I have no access to that area.  I don't feel...  Which is crazy.  Nah, you know what?  I don't know, Howard.  I mean, we've chatted briefly in the hallway.  That doesn't...  I don't expect to be brought back to his studio by one of his people.  But you know what I'm saying?  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  I wouldn't expect that.  We're supposed to be one big happy family where we try to take care of each other from  time to time, you know.  Oh, that's right.  It's all about him.  And it always has been and always will be.  Sorry.  We're supposed to show that loyalty for the company, and we're told a lot of times, you  know, it's not good for the company if you, you know, lambast them or go off on this  or do that.  And it's like, okay, but there's nothing that is put on the other side.  Like, when they have guests over there and they keep them long so we don't get them,  if we ever did that, there'd be hell to pay. 
[00:13:30]  There's a double standard, obviously, with all the shows.  And I think one of them is the fact that, you know, we would get shit on and not have  an opportunity to maybe just walk through that sacred fucking door into the Wizard of  Oz and fucking take a picture with Metallica.  It's crazy.  That fucking door is like...  You know, pure Lodicy, man.  Right?  It's pure fucking Lodicy.  It's not like I asked Gary Delabatti and he said no either.  I didn't, you know, I asked Ron Zepin as he walked in, and he actually walked in and 
[00:14:00]  asked Metallica's people, but we just...  Did he ask?  No.  Yeah, I think he did.  As soon as he closes that door behind you, then, you know, he can make believe he  asked.  I'm just saying that's a possibility.  Hey, go to the Gophers?  Right, right.  Got any extra tickets?  Are you crazy?  Yeah, I talked to my manager and he's going to take $100 off that true coat.  He did not.  He might not.  He knew who to ask for.  And I think he would just, if you don't want it to come back, that you didn't do something,  why wouldn't he?  If he didn't, he did.  But I mean, whatever.  I think people did make the effort and I appreciate the effort. 
[00:14:30]  But he's in The Wizard of Oz.  Yes, The Wizard.  Yeah.  Pay no attention to the man behind that door with a fist on it.  And The Wizard himself is starting to look like an old aunt.  Auntie M.  Auntie M.  Auntie H.  Auntie H.  Auntie H.  I think he's wearing girls' clothes now.  Is it?  Yes.  A scarf was a little weird.  I think officially he's wearing girls' clothes.  Grandma's scarf was a little weird.  Yeah, a little strange.  There might be a picture floating around where he looks like an aunt. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little frilly, a bit frilly for my taste.  E-Rock, you handed me a note over here.  Is this your handwriting?  Yes.  What is this?  Well, we found out after the after show from several people in the hallway that I guess while  Jim was waiting in the lobby to find out what was going on with Metallica, at one point  Metallica wasn't even in Howard's area.  They were in the hallway over here in Jose's office just hanging out. 
[00:15:30]  All of them?  All of them.  And then Kurt went back in through Howard's compound through the back end, got his bag,  and that's when he left.  The other guys were still over in Jose's office.  The whole band was in Jose's office?  That's what he said to me after, yeah.  Wow.  And Jose knew we were looking, but I don't know if he knew I was.  I don't know.  But that's what we found out when everything was done and we walked back to the office.  You're usually pretty good with details, Jimmy.  You're usually pretty good with details.  Wow. 
[00:16:00]  That's possible.  Walked by Jose's office.  The whole band's in there.  Hey, Jose, what's up?  Oh, hey, guys.  You mind if I get a pic?  And then you sit there.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  I wish I would have known that.  No, I didn't know.  Hey, we knew we would have said something, but maybe we shouldn't have told Jimmy that.  Yeah, you missed Tony Danza.  Yeah, he was really cool.  Yeah, it was just a whole musical thing.  How did he react when half the room left?  It was so funny.  Right in the middle of the conversation, Jimmy gets up to leave and he just goes, oh, Metallica. 
[00:16:30]  Metallica.  Yeah, he knew.  You even got Tony Danza involved.  He knew.  Tony Danza was nervous.  Yeah, he was cool.  I'm looking at my almost Metallica picture right now.  Yeah.  It just doesn't work.  Yeah, I saw.  I mean, they're all superstars in their own right, but when you're in a group thing, why  did you download this instead of the actual picture?  Oh, boy.  Fuck.  What happened there?  I don't know. 
[00:17:00]  Where's the picture?  It's fun, though.  You get to pretend you're the fourth guy.  That is true.  It's almost like taking a picture with the cardboard cutouts.  Yeah.  And you're the singer.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what the...  Just Photoshop James in there somewhere.  He doesn't manage to throw in the back.  Get a picture off of Google.  Yeah.  Fucking just crop it out.  Beautiful.  Yeah, be beautiful.  Let's see.  I don't know.  He's tall.  You can just put him behind everybody.  Yes.  Yeah.  So cheesy.  Huh? 
[00:17:30]  That would be so cheesy if somebody actually did that.  Let's do that.  Fuck it.  Fuck.  And then downstairs, I guess, there would be...  That's irritating.  If there was a band in Jose's office and no one says anything.  They should say something.  They should have said something.  Yeah.  Of course.  We all knew that you needed the picture.  Everyone was on high alert.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I heard that...  What were they doing in there?  Saying hi?  I guess.  I don't know.  They told me after I got off the air, like at 11.30 in the morning, they said, yeah,  they came to say hi to Jose and they were all hanging out in his office.  Who knows if it was the whole band or if it was fucking... 
[00:18:00]  They said it was a band.  I mean, I don't know.  Like, obviously, I didn't see if it was a game in the lobby, but...  Hmm.  Was it the whole band?  Because they said, you know, Howard's got that back door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they went through his back door, hung out in Jose's office for Sexy, and then went  back through the back door and around.  Hmm.  Um, don't you have another opportunity?  No.  Oh, I thought you did.  Nope.  That's it.  That's it.  That is it.  You sure?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Not good. 
[00:18:30]  No.  Does suck.  Yeah, it does.  I knew that, but that one I kind of saw coming, though.  That one I was like, it's just not going to happen.  Yeah, you could tell the vibe.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I don't really know anybody well in their area.  Like, I don't know their individual managers or the band's managers.  You know, I don't know any of the people I would need to know to walk right up.  Hmm.  I should be able to.  We're in the same fucking building.  Yeah, it would be nice.  It would be amazing. 
[00:19:00]  What are you going to do?  Life goes on.  Life goes on, right.  Life must go on.  And then, of course, you know.  You didn't get a Tony Danza picture.  I already have one from years ago at NEW.  Oh, perfect.  And then the, I have a big cum stain on my shirt.  I forgot.  Oh.  I didn't have it with me to get signed.  I thought they did.  But I was, I remember at NEW, I had a giant load on my stomach.  Yeah.  What, when you got the Tony Danza picture?  The black shirt, I had been, you could see it like, it's a washed out load stain. 
[00:19:30]  Were you edging?  No, that was a full batch.  And I hate playing those things out on the air, because the fans, I know, some of them  like it.  It's awesome.  No, no, but some of them like it, and some of them hate it.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I know some of them do.  Well, you know what?  That's just how it goes.  With everything.  With everything.  I wound up in a Twitter battle yesterday.  Over this?  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing.  This is just how it goes.  That's, they're, they're just assholes.  I get a, as soon as you accept that they're assholes, you can sleep better than that.  I get a tweet from some girl, because there was a cancer benefit for this fan that they've 
[00:20:00]  been asking me to do.  Right.  Oh, boy.  And I, me and Levy had texted about it, but I don't know if I'm going to be in New York.  It's on a Saturday afternoon, the October the 19th here in New York, and I just don't  know if I'm going to be here.  So, I guess I didn't see the emails from a couple of the fans.  Oh, boy.  So, this girl goes on Twitter and says, like, Jim Norton's fanboy is disgusting.  He doesn't, something I'm paraphrasing, he doesn't even care about a guy with cancer  or something.  It was like some real cunty thing. 
[00:20:30]  What, trying to connect the two?  Well, just saying, like, I care too much about a Metallica photo, but not about a fan who  has cancer.  You should get cancer, you should only get cancer.  That's a stretch, because, like, we have to say this, Jimmy's done a lot of good and  a lot of charity gigs.  But it was just like, you know.  That's just not fair, man.  So, I blast, I say something like, you're a twat.  I said, I didn't even, she's like, oh, you didn't answer the email.  I'm like, I didn't see the emails, you twat, in a private message on Twitter.  And then she posts the private message, which you always know that could happen. 
[00:21:00]  And then, says, look what I just got for Jim Norton.  So, she makes it public.  So, I blast her back publicly.  And then she's like, oh, he's trying to rally the troops.  It's like, you fucking bitch, you blast me publicly.  Then I send you a private message.  Then you post it again publicly.  And then I address you publicly.  And now I'm trying to...  Now you're trying to rally the troops.  And then everyone's telling me, no, she's not a cunt.  She's just worried about her friend.  Oh, really?  And it's like, look, you white knights.  She was shitty.  And I blasted her for being shitty. 
[00:21:30]  She was shitty to me for no fucking reason.  And they're like, well, she really likes you.  It's like, well, then you know what?  Then act like it.  Don't be a shithead publicly for no fucking reason.  Fuck her, bitch.  I addressed it with Bob Levy.  I don't have an answer yet.  Sorry.  I don't know where I'm going to be.  I'm trying to book...  I just booked Rochester for the end of October.  So, there's one week in October that's open.  It's that weekend.  And as of now, I'm in New York.  But I'm trying to fill it because I'm warming up for a dice gig.  So, I want to make sure that I'm on the road those three weeks.  Wait, you're going to Rochester?  Why? 
[00:22:00]  I literally just booked it yesterday.  Well, if you go, I go.  Period.  The thing is, I think it's the last...  Not around Halloween, though, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  We're going to do this.  Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne.  But it's amazing how...  I got a Rochester weekend in my plans.  These fucking fans want to tell you what great big fans they are and how they follow you.  And I'll never unblock another person on Twitter.  No.  Never.  Because the guy yesterday, one of the white knights, why'd you block me?  Because, you know, they all want to at-mention you.  It's like, you can shit-talk me, but don't at-mention me because that's... 
[00:22:30]  I don't research my name out.  I search out my at-mentions.  So, if you at-mention me, you're saying something to me.  So, you want me to react or you want me to hear it.  So...  Oh, I love a good block.  But I've unblocked a lot of people.  Oh, blocking me?  I don't unblock.  I won't anymore.  I think I've given one or two reprieves over the course of it.  And that was because it was a blatant error.  Like, I hit the wrong fucking block thing and they were able to convince me of that. 
[00:23:00]  But if he...  Because at whatever point during when I was reading Twitter, I decided to block someone,  I was pissed at them.  And no matter how much time goes by or anything.  Right.  Blocked!  Twitter's evil.  It is evil.  I'm tweeting less.  It's such a...  There's a lot of...  I'll wait for the next fun thing.  Nastiness there.  Yeah.  The next fun thing.  I don't mind the nastiness, but then they apologize and then you unblock them and then  they just get this dude back from Long Island.  Hey, dude, really sorry.  It's like, okay, cool. 
[00:23:30]  And then they do it again.  It's like, why would I have unblocked his asshole to begin with?  He's just a twat.  That's how they are.  That's what type of people they are.  So you don't fucking unblock them.  So I don't...  This girl, everyone's sticking up for saying she's a nice girl that she just had a bed.  Her friend's really sick with cancer.  Look, the benefits October 19th.  I don't know the details yet.  I know Levy's doing it.  Colin might be doing it.  I just don't...  It's here in the city.  It's in the afternoon.  It's from like 2 to 5 p.m.  But here's a word of advice.  If you want to get a thing where you can guarantee comedians in advance, don't hold it on a Saturday  afternoon.  That's when our road work is. 
[00:24:00]  Everyone has gigs.  A lot of...  Yeah, it's harder.  You gotta do it during the week.  You have to.  It's harder to know where I'm gonna be on a weekend.  Yeah.  I just booked a benefit in February on a Tuesday.  Because chances are I'll be here unless it's a TV show.  Like, you know, Leno or something.  Mm-hmm.  But for fucking a weekend, it's really hard to commit to that because I don't know if  I'm gonna be gone or not.  And they don't understand that.  And then they fucking attack you for it.  And then you blast them back.  And all the other fans, these white knights line up.  Hey, whoa, what are you?  She's a good girl.  Oh, God.  I hate them white knights scourge on the internet. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey.  God, don't listen to him.  Oh, what do you think?  She's gonna fucking end up at your house knocking on your door?  Thank you so much for the help.  Please lick my pussy.  Especially when she's fucking blasting me for...  I don't even know who she is.  Yeah.  And she's telling me I'm disgusting and I don't care about people.  Fuck you, then.  It's really irritating.  Fuck her. 
[00:25:00]  Had it.  Twitter people.  God.  I had a couple of good times on Twitter last night.  I was just fucking around.  Good times.  Pretty late.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course, my retweeting of various teens that decided they were playing the knockout game  with a 70-year-old man, put him in critical condition.  Wait, what happened?  I fucking... 
[00:25:30]  Did the Post call them savages like they did?  No.  The little teenagers that raided the upstate New York place and had a party?  No.  Of course not.  No, they didn't.  But they'll...  I was tweeting the fact that, like, they'll blame a game, like GTA, for murder.  But then they call murder a game.  The knockout game.  They don't address it as it's fucking murder.  They're murdering people.  So, yeah, this poor 70-year-old guy is coming out of 7-Eleven and gets attacked and blindsided. 
[00:26:00]  Where was it?  Where was this?  Syracuse.  Syracuse.  Is he dead?  Good old Syracuse.  No, he's in critical condition.  But a 50-year-old guy, 51-year-old guy, they were playing the knockout game.  Oh, sounds like fun.  Where the object is to walk up to somebody and with one punch knock him out.  Blindside him.  And they punch this guy.  He fucking cracked his head on the ground.  He never woke up.  That was it.  And it's, you know, oh, teens.  Oh, they're just playing a game.  Yeah, just punching people in the face. 
[00:26:30]  It's called fucking assault.  Oh, they're just unarmed teens.  Yeah, okay.  So I was going off on that last night a little bit.  So my kid has a chance to eventually play the knockout game?  No.  You sure?  No.  He has a chance of being a victim of the knockout game.  But to play it, apparently you have to be young.  Male, usually.  But females will usually join in after the guy's on the ground with the kicking and stomping part of it.  And, oh, right, black. 
[00:27:00]  You have to be a black person.  Why?  Black people.  I don't know, because they seem to really be the majority, the vast majority, the statistical equivalent of 100%, of everyone doing this game.  But aren't they playing catch in the backyard with their daddies, too?  No.  Because their family structure dictates that 75% of them do not have fathers.  They are from broken homes.  But that seems to be fine.  Instead of talking about how bad that is and how it's affecting society, you just accept it and say it's an alternative lifestyle. 
[00:27:30]  It's okay to have one incompetent mommy and ditch the kid off with the grandparents.  And, oh, God, there's no hope.  There's no hope left.  Let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy Spoken in New Jersey.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hello.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, so recently in the news, I'm from Hoboken.  Oh, I'm dying! 
[00:28:00]  Apparently, he got killed the other day from two teams in Jersey City that were playing the knockout game.  Ah.  See?  It's just, what happens?  They just crack him in the head, he falls down, and it's all funny.  There's no concept of right and wrong.  And I get into arguments all the time on Twitter about this, and people love to blame it on poverty. 
[00:28:30]  They go, no, it's poverty.  And so it's like, there are poor people all over the world.  And what you're saying is that if you're impoverished, you lose your concept of right from wrong and the appreciation of another human life.  You just, that goes out the window.  You all of a sudden have no concept of that anymore because that's what these people are doing.  And there are areas of different races of impoverished people that do not act like this. 
[00:29:00]  It seems to be that it is very, very prominent in the black community to perpetrate unbelievable acts of random violence that you just don't see in other communities.  You'll see violence and stuff, but, like, the randomness of it, of the black on other races' violence, is the scariest part.  Because then you're susceptible to it.  If you're not fucking somebody else's wife, or you're not robbing somebody else's house or something, the odds that someone's going to fuck with you are pretty slim. 
[00:29:30]  But that randomness, that, you know, you're a 70-year-old guy leaving a 7-Eleven and you get blindsided in the head for no fucking reason.  That's the part that is very hard to understand.  And to blame it on other things, I'm sorry.  You're saying, then, you're in essence saying that the black community is incapable of reason and incapable of right from wrong and knowing that there's a value to human life? 
[00:30:00]  Is that what the excuse is?  Because I don't get it.  I don't get it.  That's what I was doing last night.  And tweeting kitten pictures.  Wow, that's...  People love the contrast.  No kidding, that's a little strange.  It comes off looking a tad psychotic.  Whoa.  I must say.  Little Beavis.  Oh, he was so upset when I got home last night because I was away all weekend. 
[00:30:30]  So I opened the door and I just hear, beep, beep, from upstairs.  I'm like, oh, no.  I opened the door.  He couldn't get enough of me.  Oh, crawling up my leg.  It's adorable.  He was pouncing at my face.  Oh, just the cutest biting my hand.  And that's going to be horrific in another year.  When it's literally a tiger pouncing on me through the door.  You know how you say that maybe people aren't being raised right in the community?  I hear ya.  You're doing the exact same thing in the pet world.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  You are raising...  I'm raising a scourge of society.  You are raising...  Yes.  ...a tiger, basically.  Yes.  At 12.50 this morning last night.  Yeah.  All I could hear was...  Oh, no.  Scratches of the door.  Scratches of the door.  Uh-oh.  Let him in.  Who was it?  It was Bruiser Brody.  It was Bruiser Brody.  Well, let him in.  Then we won't be sleeping.  Why?  Because he just...  He'll find a spot on the bed and he'll be cool.  No, no.  Because he just headbutts and paws you. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  For what reason?  Because he wants attention.  Because you're another horrible parent.  He doesn't understand how you could be laying down.  Two horrible parents in this fucking room.  I was playing fetch with a pen with Lil' Beavis last night.  I was laying in bed and I would take the pen and throw it on the floor and he would chase  it, gets it, brings it back up on the bed and drops it right in front of me.  I got a little fetching kid and he's adorable.  Let me say how to pee.  Another video if he would do these cute things when I actually hit record.  He knows to stop being cute when I hit record, the little fucker. 
[00:32:00]  I only got limited time.  He's getting big.  Pete in South Carolina.  Pete.  Pete.  Yeah, good morning.  What's up, man?  What's up, Pete?  I got a comment, man.  I've been listening to y'all radio shows probably for the past couple months.  Ooh.  And, you know, I dig the show, but, man, shit is so racial all the time.  These kids who knock the dude out, they're not the whole fucking black race with poor  black people.  It's a couple of dumbass kids.  It doesn't have to be so fucking racial all the time.  I have to sometimes listen to y'all because of the shit that comes to all the time. 
[00:32:30]  But it is always black, young black guys that are playing the knockout game.  It's every single time.  I am a black guy, and I grew up around other black kids, and nobody ever did this.  I'm not saying all black people are doing this, but I'm saying everyone that's doing  it, the majority are black people.  Why do people mix that up all the time?  I'm not saying all black people do this.  I'm saying this is done by all black people. 
[00:33:00]  It's a difference.  There's a difference there.  But I'm not persecuting an entire people.  But I think what Pete's saying is, hold on Pete, Pete, Pete, I'll make your point, but  I think what Pete's saying is that overwhelmingly, most kids aren't doing this.  Most black kids are not doing this.  Of course not.  It would be insane.  It would be like a zombie attack if they were.  But I don't get on Twitter like, look, all fucking mass murders and serial killers are  white people.  Because they're not, but okay.  They're not, but you look at the numbers, it's generally, you know, older white people.  Of course it is.  Statistically, it is white people profile. 
[00:33:30]  So I could, I could then profile and say that this knockout game shit is predominantly  young black men.  I've never heard of this shit, man.  I've never heard of this before.  Well, watch the news, go on YouTube, punch it up.  It's, it's, it's kept out of the media for the most part.  It's, uh, I really dig the show.  But I think what he's saying is he lives closer, uh, you know, to the black people and he doesn't  see this around him whatsoever.  I'm not, people, people mix that up all the time. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, like Jimmy, he always jumps in and like, he's a valid, but you know, it's always  like, it goes too fucking far, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The truth does go too far.  People hate when I fucking spout out actual FBI statistics and, and talk about things.  There's a huge problem with violence in the young black male community.  Sorry.  That's what it is.  It's a problem.  No amount of reverence dialogue or hiding it under the carpet is going to fucking fix it.  It has to be addressed.  It has to, people have to be shamed. 
[00:34:30]  People have to be shamed and look at their problems and say, why are they doing this?  It's a goddamn disgrace.  Who the fuck is doing it?  I never grew up with this shit.  Well, you're a lucky man.  You're a lucky man.  You must live next door to me.  I'm telling you, no, it's not true.  I went to predominantly white college, man.  Well, exactly.  There you go.  That's why.  No, no, no, no.  I said college, bro.  But I grew up around black people my whole life.  I still have black friends.  This shit never fucking happened.  I never heard of this shit.  Can I tell you the first time I heard of the knockout game, it was, I was reading something 
[00:35:00]  about, I forget, what's the guy's name?  There's a guy who started the Crips.  He's in jail now.  I forget his name.  Chucky?  Chucky, he's a big dude.  And they said that this is probably in the 60s or the 70s.  Yeah.  That in the neighborhood that he was in, they would play the knockout game where you would  have to walk up and just see.  I don't know if they called it that, but you would have to see if you could knock somebody  out with one punch.  I just want to say this part, get off, man.  Just really, I think it's a small segment, but because it's put out there in the press,  people think it's a large segment of the black community, but it's really not. 
[00:35:30]  It's a small segment.  We think they're fucking idiots, too.  So it's not just, you know, because a huge problem in the black community, a couple of  dumbasses doing it, you put their ass in jail.  But don't feign everybody with the same stroke, man.  I don't think putting people in jail is the answer, either.  It's amazing to me that people go, well, he was arrested, so it's okay.  No.  The trick is to not have it perpetrated on people in the first fucking place.  I've heard that enough times.  Why are you asking for justice for this guy?  They arrested the perpetrator.  Yeah, big fucking deal.  How about you figure out the problem and fix it? 
[00:36:00]  Look at Chicago.  They're talking about bringing the National Guard.  They're talking about bringing the National fucking Guard into Chicago, because the police  force can't even handle the amount of fucking drug and gang-related shootings and violence  that's going on in Chicago.  Bro, idiots are going to be idiots.  Idiots are going to be idiots, but when 10% of the population amounts to fucking over  50% of the idiots, there's a problem.  Look, look, you could keep being blinded. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, don't address it.  No, no, no.  I'm addressing what you said.  You're talking about a small segment of the population, but in this particular incident,  but you can't continue to say it's always a black issue, it's a black problem.  It's a fucking dumbass problem.  The knockout game is predominantly done by young black males, period.  I'm not saying that young black males are all doing it.  You're talking about me, bro.  That's what you are saying, predominantly.  No, I'm not.  I'm saying that...  Do you understand?  It's so hard to make people understand the simplest concept. 
[00:37:00]  I'm not saying that the majority of young black males are doing the knockout game.  I'm saying of the people that do the knockout game, the majority are young black males.  Do you understand what I just said?  Okay, so I'm not saying that because there's all white males in that room.  One of you guys is going to eventually fucking flip out and shoot everybody in Syria.  Come on, man.  It's bullshit.  You could probably say that about any radio show on this platform.  No, but you can say that if somebody does go into a workplace and shoot it up,  it will probably be a white middle-aged man. 
[00:37:30]  But you can't say that most white middle-aged men go to their workplace and shoot it up.  See the difference?  Holy fuckaroni!  Bro, I'm going to continue listening, man.  Let's be fair.  Of course you will!  But I will say, too, if I had to be scared of someone...  If I saw a black guy walking through this hallway, a young black guy in camouflage...  Right.  ...or a 45-year-old white guy with a mustache and an army hat,  I'd be much more worried about the 45-year-old white guy and the mustache and the army hat. 
[00:38:00]  In this setting.  Yeah, sure.  Because statistics show that you have more of a chance of being blown away by that.  But if I'm out on the street in a shitty neighborhood,  and I see a couple of black guys across the street,  I'll fucking stay on the other side of the street as I walk by.  Now, they could be fucking Rhodes Scholars.  I don't know.  But statistically, I'm going to play the odds and not have any interaction with them.  You know what one of the problems is, and this caller is kind of addressing it, too,  it's the fact that the press avoids certain things, and they avoid certain truths, 
[00:38:30]  and they don't say it or they tiptoe.  So when you say something bluntly, it sounds really offensive or it sounds racist.  But no one's offended if you say that most people who fucking shoot up the workplace are white.  They are.  Most guys, most school shootings as far as random acts of,  I hate my mom and dad violence, are white kids.  Right, young white guys, sure.  Without a doubt.  Yep.  Whenever I hear about a school shooting, like where there's a bunch of kids killed,  I've never once thought, oh God, that's a black kid.  If it's one guy shot in the parking lot, eh, maybe that's a black kid. 
[00:39:00]  But if it's fucking 30 people massacred, you almost always know it's a white kid.  So nobody's stepping up and saying, hey, we need to fix the problem.  Don't ignore the problem.  Because, but yeah, yeah, you know why?  Because could you imagine a young white guy going into a school or a workplace or something  and killing or shooting between 15 and 20 people every weekend?  Could you imagine the fucking outrage?  That's what's happening in Chicago alone.  And in Atlanta, New York City, Detroit, 
[00:39:30]  you're going to get a fuckload more that happens every week in this country.  If white, young white guys were shooting up schools at that rate,  we'd be under martial fucking law.  Bro, here's the deal.  If that's going on, I'm all for it, man.  It is going on.  I want anybody getting shot, what color, what race.  If there's a problem, address it.  But if you don't address it, of course you don't address it.  Well, I'm addressing it, but you don't want to hear it.  If there's a problem, address it.  There's a problem in the black community with young black men and violence. 
[00:40:00]  There's a problem.  There, I addressed it.  Now you'll tell me to shut up,  because that's how it works in this country.  We address it.  We need an open dialogue.  We need to do this.  All right, let me say it.  Ah, you're racist.  Fuck that.  What a bunch of hypocritical fuckwads we are.  You want to feel sorry for yourself, but here's the deal, man.  It doesn't happen like that.  And there's a segment, but it doesn't happen like that.  I'm not around people getting shot up every day.  Thank God for that.  You aren't either.  I know.  But I mean, but I work. 
[00:40:30]  But I work in New York City, and I take precautions.  I take precautions when I walk around New York City to stay in better areas.  When I'm in an iffy area, I'm much more alert to my surroundings.  And I will profile people based on statistics and keep myself safe in that way.  I'm okay with that, but my thing is, your listeners are predominantly white, probably, right?  When you say things like you say, sometimes you kind of fuel a lot of shit that goes on. 
[00:41:00]  I'm not fueling anything.  No, man, I'm saying you're intelligent enough to understand it.  No, I'm not.  I hear the thing.  It's a mob mentality that you create some...  Mob mentality?  You mean like when the knockout game's being played, and then five or eight more guys jump in  and kick and fucking punch the guy that's on the ground?  Yeah, like that mob mentality?  What's the caller's name?  I'm sorry, what's your name?  My name is Seaton.  It's egregious.  I don't like it either. 
[00:41:30]  Pete, you know, you fall into a trap, though, that people fall into...  I can walk on.  Like saying, like, hey, Ann, if you say that, or whatever it is a person says, you're creating  this mentality, like, you understand it, but other people might not.  Like, that's an arrogance that, like, the press has about themselves, or people are like,  well, I understand it, but the average guy won't.  And I never look at it like that.  Like, I never think that if I get it, but the people listening to us won't get it.  Like, I just give them the same credit. 
[00:42:00]  It's true, and the thing is, when I listen to you guys, it always, the dude, he always  comes out and, like, you know, just a black thing.  And, you know, it makes it hard for me to kind of fuck with y'all.  I listen to it.  Some of the shit is all based, you know, the colors, and, but, you know, the shit is funny.  But when you always kind of fuel the fire, like, you know, that racism shit, man.  Jim and Opie counterbalance my fucking shit very well.  It's a very balanced program.  What?  Her name. 
[00:42:30]  I don't, she comes from you in a different way, bro.  And I'm just saying, it comes out.  Yeah, because, because I'm trying to be as honest as I can possibly be, and I know a lot  of times it's opinion, but a lot of times it's fact-based.  And, and when, when I'm told that we need an open, honest dialogue, and then you try to  have one, and you're fucking labeled with racist, or, or, yeah, let's have an open dialogue,  because as long as, uh, what you're saying doesn't offend me.  Now we're just back to square one.  No, no, no.  No, no, you can say what you want to say, man, but that doesn't mean the shit is true. 
[00:43:00]  I mean, we can still say, man.  No, some of the shit I am saying is absolutely true.  When I back it up with facts, with facts, it is true.  No, it's not going on in my neighborhood.  Why the fuck would I live in a neighborhood riddled with crime?  Here's what I'm saying.  I'm talking about the area that you're concerned with.  You're talking about Chicago, these other areas, but what I'm telling you is-  It affects me financially.  It affects me as far as how I can exercise my Second Amendment.  So it does affect me. 
[00:43:30]  Me too, and I'm a black dude, but what I'm telling you is, just don't say, like,  oh, it's a black problem.  It's not a black problem.  I'm not going to say it again.  Bro, bro, I'm telling you, it doesn't, it's not the largest segment of the department.  I understand.  I think I've addressed that already.  All right, hold on.  Many times.  Hold on one minute.  I've got to go to Bernard in the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Bernard, you're on with Pete in South Carolina.  Yo, Pete, what's up, man?  Whatchamacallit, this stuff, though, this is old.  When I was younger, they used to come up to you, and they'd be like, 
[00:44:00]  yo, you like Hawaiian punch?  And if you say yeah, you're going to punch right in the face.  I've said it like four times until I figured out, oh, don't say yes to Hawaiian punch.  And there you go, man.  That used to be the commercial, the little guy would say, how about a nice Hawaiian punch?  And then they changed the campaign to where E-Rock comes through the wall.  But there you go, Bernard, a nice white guy living in the Bronx.  Right, see?  Right, Bernard?  Who, white guy? 
[00:44:30]  The old slow love.  Oh, I'm white.  I'm white only for six months when the summer is here.  All right, Bernard.  All right.  It's all fun.  Everyone's just having fun growing up, doing their thing, finding their way.  Pete, I hope you continue to listen and, you know, get upset with what I'm saying is fine and stuff.  But, you know, I'm not going to change the way I talk about race and violence issues in this country.  I'm just not going to do it.  All right. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you for the call, Pete.  Pete, thank you.  Call any time.  Yeah.  Help us.  I like that.  Help us, please.  Help us.  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  I like it.  At least you get to sit in the car and enjoy traffic.  Right.  I have to sit next to Peter Finch and network.  That's why we take such long breaks.  It gets way worse when we turn these microphones off.  You know what it's like to have you walk to the bathroom with somebody following you, yelling FBI statistics on the wall?  We feel way safer as long as these mics are on.  Oh, my God.  If we didn't have to piss, we'd keep these microphones on for four hours. 
[00:45:30]  Let's go to Korea, man.  We haven't taken a call from Korea in a while.  Daniel.  Hey, boys.  I have a real hard-hitting question to follow that up.  Yes.  Opie, did you eat your Lucky Charms last night?  See, I know you people need to.  No, I just know it.  I was able to say no to the Lucky Charms and go to bed.  Damn.  Damn.  Again.  I'm on a roll, man. 
[00:46:00]  No Lucky Charms for the opster.  That is good.  Although I had sushi that someone suggested.  Of course.  Why would I fucking listen to anybody?  I'm obsessed with fake tuna.  It's my new thing.  Fake tuna?  I'm obsessed with it.  Oh, it's the stuff that...  I thought it was a band.  Look it up.  Look it up.  Fake fucking tuna.  For the sushi lovers out there, as soon as you start looking up the fake tuna bullshit  that is happening in most Japanese restaurants, it'll drive you insane.  What is it?  It looks like tuna. 
[00:46:30]  It's that shiny shit.  Is it good?  It's not tuna.  You don't like it?  It's okay.  It doesn't suck, but it's not tuna.  And somebody turned me on to a new sushi joint in our neighborhood, Jimmy, on 72nd Street,  and I said, fuck it, I gotta give it a try.  And of course, I love tuna, and I got it, and it's not fucking tuna, and it drives me insane.  It's more...  The fish I'm talking about, it's much redder, and it's very shiny. 
[00:47:00]  I'm not...  Fake?  That looks real, but I'm not sure.  Did you look up fake tuna or real tuna?  Fake?  It's very hard to tell.  It's hard to tell, but you know it when you eat it, and it drives me nuts.  Damn.  And most places, I read an article, it's up to like 70, 75% of the places get away with giving  you this, like, I call it...  It might even be in the tuna family, technically, but it's not tuna, like people like tuna, sushi.  How could they do that? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  I mean, could you find some articles on it?  There's some kind of loophole, because the fish they're serving is way cheaper, is what  it comes down to.  They do that with the crab leg sushi.  You know, like, it's cooked, but it's supposed to be a crab leg, and a lot of times it's like  some fucking fake fish.  They dye it red on the outside.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So that's...  That's not fucking crab, but they can sell it like that.  I don't know how.  But there's enough sushi joints, so I try to find a place that actually serves tuna, and  it's really hard to find. 
[00:48:00]  Really, really hard to find.  They take that little thing, and they take a skate or a ray, and they just pop out scallops.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're supposed to be scallops, and it's fucking...  Yeah, and they call them scallops?  Why?  Because that's the shape they're in, or is it the thing you're eating?  It's not a scallop, motherfucker.  What do you got, Sam?  They did a study in New York to find out who was selling fake fish.  Right.  Because apparently that's a big thing.  Right.  It's a huge thing.  I didn't just pull this out of my ass.  As soon as I discussed...  Because I started getting suspicious. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, wait a minute.  It looks like tuna.  What the fuck?  It looks like tuna, but it just doesn't taste like tuna.  It just doesn't taste like tuna.  You know, it's not bad.  It's okay.  But when you eat tuna, you know it.  You just...  I just love it.  Anyway.  But they did it through DNA tests and everything.  DNA!  Today, in New York, fish that was not really tuna was being passed off as tuna in 94%.  There you go.  You are not the tuna!  There you go.  What place do they list?  Which places didn't do that?  It's almost every place. 
[00:49:00]  That's the problem.  94%.  See, that's higher than what I said.  Yeah, 94%.  What kind of fish is it instead, did they say?  I mean, they said, for example, when they did red snapper at sushi bars, they found 28 different  distinct species being passed off as red snapper.  Damn.  Including 17 that weren't even in the snapper family.  Oh!  The snapper family!  You...  Yeah.  What?  You know it when you eat it.  And it's so frustrating to me, because I really like sushi. 
[00:49:30]  And the fish they do serve is just okay.  It doesn't suck, but you don't get the same experience.  Now that I know that, it drives me fucking bad.  You probably gotta pay a lot.  Fine!  Tell me where!  You just heard, Sam, 94%.  You can't even find places that are actually doing the right thing.  Do you know how much fun it is, by the way, the different things that bother you guys  this morning?  Like, the fucking, you are like, the fucking, it's a problem in the black community, and 
[00:50:00]  then 20 seconds later, I hate fake tuna!  Well, you already went through, damn metallic, I couldn't get there.  I'm a plane!  It's really three completely different obsessions.  I'm a bit of a simpleton.  I'm the simpleton on the show.  But look what I like.  I'm obsessed I couldn't get my photo taken with four guys who I've met already.  Like, it doesn't matter what it is, it's just different personalities. 
[00:50:30]  Mm-hmm.  Tuna just makes me go, mmm, oh my god, I just fucking love it.  And then I get this fake shit, and I get so bummed out.  I don't like the food that's fake, because I had to pay for it, you want to eat what you're  fucking paying for.  It was fake last night, and I knew it.  I'm like, fuck, I knew this would be another place that has the fake shit.  How about the place that we've eaten at, I don't want to say it, because in case it's  fake, the place we've eaten at on the air, you and I have gone there to eat there once  and you weren't crazy.  The one you really like?  Yeah.  No, no, they got the real stuff, but I just, I don't like them for other reasons. 
[00:51:00]  They fancy up their shit.  I don't mind a good, yeah.  I just want a basic sushi.  Gussy it up.  Now we're getting way too deep, don't give a fuck.  Let me say hi to Andrew in Jersey.  Yeah.  By the way, the phone's equally ringing for a racist issue, and fake tuna.  And fake tuna.  I feel good right now.  Absolutely.  They're digging it.  But it's funny, you know, like the tuna thing is an issue, the Metallica photo, and then  you hear all this Kenya stuff.  Like, come on, stop wasting time with that.  This is the issue.  Right. 
[00:51:30]  That Kenya thing just depresses the fuck out of me.  Yeah.  We're heading toward a society that we're not going to leave our houses.  There's no fucking way.  It's a dress rehearsal.  Yeah.  You know, to imagine a fucking mall.  I'm surprised it hasn't happened here, to be very honest.  Around Chris's time in this fucking crazy.  I've been saying that for years.  I'm shocked it hasn't happened here.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, you know, that's why Fresh Direct and all these fucking businesses are doing really  well.  Yeah.  People don't want to leave their houses anymore.  You get a really nice flat screen TV with a really nice sound system.  Uh-huh.  You get your food fucking delivered to your house. 
[00:52:00]  You're good.  Well, look what happened.  It's getting scarier out there.  Charles Bronson's fucking wife and daughter when he had the food delivered to the house.  I hear you.  Mm-hmm.  I hear you.  I killed rich cunt.  I hear you, but I don't know.  I don't know if it's actually getting scarier out there or it's just perceived to be scarier  because of the news cycles.  I don't know.  Because some people will tell you that it is down, but it's hard to believe that sometimes.  Let's say hi to Andrew.  Andrew.  Hey, I don't like the way you guys are generalizing all the fake tuna. 
[00:52:30]  I ain't never seen no fake tuna in my whole life.  Bravo.  Fake tuna is a burden.  Bravo, Andrew.  That's very funny.  Bastards.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy, we got a food guy, food business guy.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike, help me out.  What's going on out there?  I know it's very suspicious.  I know it's happening, but I don't even know what the name of the fish is that they're 
[00:53:00]  trying to pass off as a tuna or a high-quality tuna.  A lot of it is yellowfin tuna.  Okay?  So what they do with yellowfin tuna is they treat it with a gas, the gas flushing.  So it brings out the redness.  Right.  And I sell a lot of these places.  So what they do is they use this tuna, but that is about six bucks a pound.  Whereas the real tuna, a number one fresh tuna, is probably $14 or $15.  Oh.  Yeah, they're trying to save money. 
[00:53:30]  So that's the difference.  So technically...  Well, it is tuna, but it is a gas-flushed, CO2-treated product, is what it is.  Yeah, because the thing looks beautiful.  It's like, holy fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good piece of tuna.  It looks unbelievable, but that's why it's so deceiving, because then you bite into it  and it's just okay.  So it's really yellowfin tuna?  It's a lot of it is yellowfin tuna, and it gas flushes.  It's called gas flush or CO2-treated.  That's what Jimmy does to us in here.  He gas flushes us.  Yeah, we're beet red.  Yeah, holding our breath. 
[00:54:00]  At this point, we're beet red, just like the fake tuna.  That's right.  See, the jokes are still there, but it's just tuna.  It's just tuna.  It doesn't matter about the subject.  We'll get to the jokes.  There you go.  Mike, wow.  That gas shit is scary.  They use that gas shit to bring out colors and everything.  That's fucked up.  They do.  All right.  A lot of games played in the food business, guys.  Well, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Mike.  Definitely get what you pay for.  Well, I cross off another sushi joint in our neighborhood that's not fucking serving their good shit.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  It's so frustrating.  Hmm.  I'm going to take a break, although you already ate.  I know.  I have to eat this fast.  It tastes like shit if you wait.  Dude, I have no treats in my house right now.  It congeals.  No treats.  No?  You need some kind of treat.  Decided to finally lose the baby weight, man.  Hmm.  My daughter's almost a year old.  It was time.  Yeah, huh?  I have to fucking lose the baby weight.  So you're not snacking?  No snacking-y snacks?  Oh, I want to. 
[00:55:00]  Of course you do.  Of course I want to.  Great thing.  No ice cream in the freezer.  This is exactly how I like it.  I need a good ice cream sandwich every so often.  I understand, but...  Oh, boy.  And I'm just waiting for my son to notice.  He hasn't noticed yet.  Oh, he's going to be like, hey.  What the fuck?  But I'm waiting for him to bring it up.  I'm waiting for him to bring it up.  Why?  I got it.  He finally has it and goes, what the fuck is going on here?  And then we're like, all right.  Where are the goodies?  Because I'm the one eating all the kids' shit. 
[00:55:30]  So what's going on with this mall thing?  Is there still hostages?  Yeah, it's like...  I don't know.  They've been going days on this thing.  I guess the Kenyan fucking response team kind of sucks.  I don't know if they suck.  It's a pretty tough spot.  They're killing everybody they can.  I mean, you know, the Kenyan police or army, whatever.  Well, they were asking people, too.  Are you a Muslim?  Yep.  Putting a gun in your head.  And then they would ask you a question.  Like, what if you said yes?  Of course, in that situation, you know, to say yes.  They say, well, who is Muhammad's mother? 
[00:56:00]  And if you don't know the answer, they assume you're lying.  And they shoot you.  You say, the chick that's on my dick!  And then they shoot you.  Well, could you tell us who Muhammad's mother is so we're safe out there?  Or some other question, I'm sure.  Do you even know the answer to that?  No, I don't.  But I'd be sure that they would ask you to say a Muslim prayer or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they were just targeting non-Muslims.  So you can't say that the killers are Muslim because you never want to jump to conclusions.  But I think we can say that they weren't non-Muslims.  Right.  So they're just, you know, it's again, it's just another fucking, um... 
[00:56:30]  So as humans, we've just decided that we just need to destroy this planet, right?  Well, there's...  We just decided.  We just have to.  We just have to do that.  Yeah, I mean, we've been doing it for a long time.  But the group right now that's just killing people based on religion is that group.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Unbelievable.  But they're saying there might have been a couple Americans involved, you know.  Oh, yeah, from Minnesota, from Somalian Americans.  Yeah, from Somalian ethnicity.  They're saying a couple might have been Americans.  They're saying they were about 18 or 19 years old. 
[00:57:00]  They're pretty certain about that, actually.  But religion is so, and it's all religion, is so, you can't question religion.  And I know that that's one of the founding principles of our country.  But why can't you ridicule it?  Like, why isn't...  Catholicism, all of it.  Why don't we look at people's religion and judge their intelligence?  Or judge their ability to be reasonable?  You have the freedom to practice it.  That's fine.  No one's going to infringe on that.  But, boy, you can sure say, wow, that's stupid, you know.  Yeah, but you can't, though. 
[00:57:30]  And it's like...  No.  Not that you should be judged on it, but why can't you in a debate go,  yeah, well, you're a Christian.  You actually think a guy fucking kicked a rock out after he was dead.  Oh, man.  Like, why can't you bring up that stuff?  Oh!  Why is that such a fucking, I hate to say, sacred cow?  Yeah.  As far as being critiqued.  I'm just glad I was born Catholic, because, you know,  I don't think the opster would have put up numbers  if he had to walk around Geneseo with Pais or anything.  Yeah.  How do you get things done looking like that? 
[00:58:00]  That's a tough one.  I'm not even making fun of the religion.  I'm just looking at...  I'm making fun of how people look when they walk around.  I'm like, you know, when you're growing up,  it's tough enough to try to get girls.  And then you got the, you know, the curly fries on the side of your head,  and then you got the big fucking tall hat.  It's like, how do you get anything done that way?  As far as girls go.  By only getting chicks that are in the same fucking, you know, religious sect.  But that's tough, too.  Yeah.  I went across the board.  Yeah.  No Muslims, though.  Maybe one. 
[00:58:30]  The opster might have had one.  You ever go to a Jewish singles...  I had one.  I had a few Jewish bruds.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Their nipples were always a little strange.  Really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Never noticed.  No, I didn't either.  Oh, maybe it was the one I was with.  She had big hands, but the nipples almost looked like they weren't there.  Oh, the inverted nipples?  They were just so light.  Everything was so light.  Oh, really?  It was a little strange. 
[00:59:00]  Hmm.  I was looking at Twitter last night, and I saw this way to execute people.  That was just insane.  What?  That's in the old days.  Right.  And this is an old, like, fucking...  Where the fuck did they do this?  Like, fucking the Ottoman Empire or something.  I don't know.  They would tie people...  Wait, is that what the ventriloquist was killing people?  I don't know.  Yeah, this is Otto.  Of course.  They would load up a cannon, and then they would tie you with, like, the middle of your 
[00:59:30]  back against the muzzle of the cannon.  Oh, boy.  They'd tie your arms back.  Or actually, not even tie your arms back.  They'd tie your waist...  Right.  ...to the cannon wheels.  Right.  And then blast it.  Jesus.  And there was this description from a witness.  It said the head shot off and went, like, 40 feet in the air.  And the arms just fucking flew off the side.  And there was this just pulpy meat that flew everywhere.  Yeah.  It sounds fast.  It does sound fast. 
[01:00:00]  And you've got to think people probably behaved.  Yeah, I would gather.  Because I think back then, too, you were kind of forced to see that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  To put in your mind, like, how about you not, you know, do anything wrong.  Actually, one guy was put to death because he had kind of gone with a boy.  You know, this guy goes with a boy, and they did things, and they actually killed both of  them.  But they tied him up to the old cannon and blasted it. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  Oh, there were some descriptions that were just, like, written in oldie-time speak.  So maybe things are getting better out there.  I don't know.  They ought to bring that one back.  They had mass executions where they had, like, 20 cannons lined up in a row and 20 guys  and just vroom!  And fucking, like, meat would just fly.  One guy was talking about pieces of a stomach and a liver, and they'd come down on fire sometimes.  And heads just fucking flying.  Actual descriptions from eyewitnesses?  Yeah.  Wow.  Crazy shit. 
[01:01:00]  See, I think the weird shit, like, now who has to clean up all that stuff?  You can't just have it laying around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or do they just blast it into an open field and let some pigs go or something?  No, I would think you'd have to, like, clean it up.  It's pretty disgusting.  They didn't understand human remains back then.  No, no.  If you're doing that...  Yeah, yeah.  They probably didn't care that there were human remains laying there.  Right.  If you're going to blow someone up with a cannon.  I watched a gem last night.  Two guys executed by a cartel.  One got shot in the head painlessly. 
[01:01:30]  It was really weird.  Two guys kneeling in a field.  And one guy, and I shouldn't have watched it.  Of course not.  I don't know.  Believe me.  Why?  He's not doing it.  I know.  I'm having nightmares.  They pop him.  Is that because the Metallica thing didn't work out yesterday?  So you figured I got to, like...  I have to punish myself.  I got to punish myself with some horrific images.  No, but it did make my breathing a little weird.  Like, I went to the chest doctor yesterday.  I finally went to have my physical chest checked.  Oh.  And the other guy, they sawed his head off.  It was just...  They started from the back.  Oh, the back?  I don't even need to listen to this. 
[01:02:00]  He's on his hands and knees.  But it was really weird.  His hands weren't even tied.  He just kind of stayed propped, like, almost on his hands and knees.  Like, he just didn't...  He was just like...  But he made a lot of noise.  He was none too happy.  Oh, my God.  With the proceedings.  They sawed it?  Well, there's a knife.  A knife?  But I've never seen it done from the back.  You mean why?  Once they got through his spine, his arms didn't collapse?  No, I...  What the fuck's that about?  Maybe he was feeling it, because then they turned it on his back.  Maybe it was a David Blaine trick.  Maybe a mind freak.  Maybe a mind freak.  Maybe the mind freak was in the area. 
[01:02:30]  No, they couldn't cut through all the...  Through the spine.  They had to turn him on his back.  Oh, yeah.  And saw him through the front.  Oh, sure.  Why did you watch?  Yeah, why do you watch that stuff?  I'm stupid.  Oh.  But why do you watch, you think?  Just because it's there.  I know I can't.  I can't watch.  Someone sent me a picture of that poor fucker in Brooklyn, was it?  Yeah, I saw that.  That just got his head fucking whacked by the...  Queens.  Was it Queens?  Head whacked by the remote control helicopter.  I was stupid enough to click on that.  Yeah.  That's real, too, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That fucking thing cracked him right in the head.  Went through his skull.  About halfway through his skull. 
[01:03:00]  That was a brutal one.  And then the next rotor probably spun around.  Hit him in the jaw.  In his cheek.  Yeah, yeah.  How does that get on the internet?  I don't know.  Or might have been a passerby.  Maybe someone else took it before everyone got there.  No, but it looked like it was already a...  Yeah, it looked like it had a sheet.  Yeah, it looked like it was already a police...  People leak that shit.  Murder site.  Yeah, someone screencaps the fucking...  A police computer or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  That was pretty fucking sick.  That must have been fast for him, though. 
[01:03:30]  Thwock, you're out.  You're done.  He didn't feel a thing.  That's horrific, though.  Sad and Newell.  All right, let's take a break.  We got a lot of guests.  It's weird when we have the final three are piled...  We had Stephen Merchant, who I can't wait to talk to, and the great fucking James  Khan.  James Khan.  Wow.  But how do we have Warren Haynes 15 minutes after James Khan?  Probably because James Khan doesn't have a lot of time.  I hope so.  That's probably a quickie.  That's exactly...  That's fine.  James Khan is 15 minutes.  Boom.  Yeah, and then we get Warren Haynes jamming some blues today.  He comes in. 
[01:04:00]  We talk to him.  Bada beep, bada boop.  He's got to go.  I've seen his show.  I saw the show.  I like the Warren Haynes.  I'm a big fan of the Warren Haynes.  I love Warren Haynes.  I'm more excited about Warren Haynes than anybody else on that list.  Oh!  You think James Khan?  Jimmy Khan?  Yep.  Not James Khan.  Yep.  It's crazy.  Yep.  Absolutely.  I'm excited.  They're all coming in.  Don't get me wrong.  That's my number one.  I like Warren Haynes.  Oh, he is.  All right.  That's the Audi. 
[01:04:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  One baby to another says I'm lucky to meet you.  I don't care what you think. 
[01:05:00]  It's about me.  No way.  Today?  Yeah.  Wow.  God, I remember where I was, too.  Buffalo, New York.  And Nirvana came out.  Oh.  The one for the masses, obviously.  And then that pissed off everybody that already knew who they were.  Yeah.  And when I say everybody, I mean that city of Seattle.  They were sellout motherfuckers at that point.  They knew them locally, but the rest of the country, for the most part, did not know Nirvana until nevermind. 
[01:05:30]  On this date in 1991.  Wow.  22 years ago.  Jesus.  Wait, so I was almost raped 22 years ago?  Whoa.  Jesus.  Fuck.  I was almost raped.  Well, someone brought it up on Twitter yesterday.  I guess there's a similar story in the paper or something.  By the way, I didn't bother clicking the link.  I just made believe.  Yeah.  So I could have a little moment with this guy.  I'm like, oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I didn't feel like reading last night.  I was tired.  But he goes, no, it's like, what happened to you?  And then I'm like, oh, the time I almost got raped.  Or murdered.  Or both.  Both, maybe.  Could have been both.  Which would have been really horrible.  Oh, if they find you and it's like, oh, the cum's dripping out of his ass.  Oh, no.  That was real.  That would suck.  See, that should have made me hate a certain group of people.  Because, you know, the gentleman over my bed that faithful afternoon was a black guy. 
[01:06:30]  That's fucking...  In a hoodie.  Damn.  And I woke up because he was staring right at me.  Fucking the scariest moment of my life.  Hoodies up for opioid rape.  Why was he, like, staring at me?  He had the whole apartment.  I think why...  I finally figured it out.  Yeah.  For the people that don't know, I lived in Buffalo, pretty close to Allen Street. 
[01:07:00]  I forgot the north...  I'll get matters.  I think it was North Pearl Street, for the people that are local.  It was a nice little building.  And some asshole was moving out, so we had the fucking doors open.  The double doors that you needed the keys for.  Oh, man.  And I was stupid enough to just leave my door on...  I'm trying to remember what floor it lived on.  Like, the third floor, I think.  Unlocked.  And the light bulb in my hallway went out, and I was lazy back then, so I would go down 
[01:07:30]  a dark...  Oh, perfect storm.  I would go down a dark hallway to my apartment.  That's smart.  Instead of telling the super to get another light bulb.  You were asking for it, you slut.  I was only making $14,000 a year, and that's the God's honest truth.  I think they pushed me up to $16,000 before I left Buffalo.  Righteous bucks.  And then I was taking my nap, because I did overnights, and thinking I was safe, because  this asshole was moving out of the building, he had the doors wide open.  So there was an opportunist came into the building, and I guess he was trying all the 
[01:08:00]  doors, I would assume.  Yeah.  And mine was unlocked, so he went in my apartment, and now I finally figured out...  Like I said, I was making $16,000.  I had nothing to steal.  Uh-huh.  Literally nothing to steal.  Even my TV was shitty.  I had nothing.  Oh, man.  So I think he...  Except that fucking ass.  So then I think he went into my bedroom almost to be like, what the fuck?  He probably was mad at wanting to confront me. 
[01:08:30]  And I woke up, and I remember not moving a muscle and just saying, what the fuck are  you doing in here?  And your hair was longer, right?  Your hair was longer, so, you know...  Your back was turned?  No, I woke right up to see eyes in my face.  I was thinking he probably thought he had, like, Julianna Moore laying there.  Fucking turn your head, and holy shit.  So maybe he was looking to see if I was a chick.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, man.  Because, you know, as the story goes, he didn't take one fucking thing in my apartment.  And I always put my wallet and my car keys right at the door on some dumb, horrible, just 
[01:09:00]  lame-ass shelf from Home Depot or whatever the fuck.  And I remember jumping up, not chasing him out of the apartment, but going, what the  fuck?  Hey, hey, hey.  Now being brave, because I know he was on the run.  So now I'm brave to chase him, of course.  Yeah.  And as I'm running out of my apartment, I'm like, holy fuck, he's got my car keys.  I thought he was going to steal my car.  And that was even shitty.  That was a piece of shit.  But it turned out, I never took my keys and my wallet out of my jeans, or what, I think 
[01:09:30]  in my jeans, and they were just laying in my pants on the floor.  The only reason I'm saying all this again was because someone brought it up on Twitter.  That would have been...  And then I think there was some kind of rapist in the area, so I guess I might have, you  know, had a, had a, had a, almost a conversation with the local rapist.  Anyway.  That would have been brutal.  Jesus. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, oh, the point, bring it right around, Nirvana, never mind, was the soundtrack of my  Almost Rape.  Oh, really?  That was playing?  Oh, fuck.  I played that one to death, that album.  Not as big as a Nirvana fan as I get older.  Still like a few, but I was really, I was all in when they hit.  Yeah, I mean, everybody was.  I was like, fuck, yeah, enough of this hairband shit.  It's a little, uh...  And I went through the hairband stage like everyone else, but that got so just watered  down. 
[01:10:30]  Because you only have a small limited catalog with Nirvana?  Yeah.  So they couldn't grow, so you hear so many things that sound like them and people that  have ripped them off, it's kind of hard to appreciate them because they didn't thought  they put out eight albums, right?  Right.  Yeah.  A puddle of mud, maybe?  They might have, uh...  They might have taken the Nirvana sound.  Yeah.  We did this break, right, E-Rock?  Yeah, E-Rock.  Yes, we did.  Okay.  I want to make sure.  We can do it again. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, missing skydiver's body found.  Shoot wasn't fully deployed.  Oh, you gotta be a fucking lunatic.  When I was going out east for the summer there, I would see the skydivers all the fucking  time jumping.  You would see them jump out of the plane, basically.  Yeah, they have a place out there.  More than once, I saw, like, all of a sudden, there's one, there's two, there's three, there's  about four or five.  Man.  And I just keep trying to wrap my head around it thinking, you know, just do it.  I don't know.  I just don't... 
[01:11:30]  If I could do it with the golden, whatever the fuck they're called...  Oh, what the West Point guys are, the...  They parachuted into Yankee Stadium at one of the games I was at.  Yeah.  I'm like, I would do it with those guys.  But not just some guy that's trying to get a business going on Long Island.  Some Yopo...  And I'm sure they're good, I don't know.  ...strapped to their fucking ass to dick.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I don't know how people do that.  I don't know.  I can do the scuba diving, easy. 
[01:12:00]  If I had to jump out of a plane, if there was something going on, you know, you have  to, that's one thing.  But to want to, just to do it, no, I won't.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I don't know what the upside is.  It's that much of a thrill?  I hear it's quite the thrill, everything, but...  You're standing there, the door's wide open on the side of the plane, and I just can imagine  how much I would shake.  And then they're like, all right, time to jump.  And you just go, really? 
[01:12:30]  When you take off...  All this is going to work, right?  Yeah.  You take off in an airplane, in a jet, and you look out the window, and you reach a certain  height, you know, anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 feet.  Right.  You look at that, and you're like, that's where I would be jumping out of a fucking plane?  Oh, I've done that a million times.  You're right.  It's like, that would be...  I couldn't even fathom that.  And why would that be fun?  Yeah.  The terror.  And your brain just, like, it knows how to protect itself, so it would just freak your  body out, going, no, see, we're not supposed to be doing this. 
[01:13:00]  They shove you right the fuck out of there.  I ain't going!  I ain't going!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Full metal jacket, that's how you do it.  Right, right.  Would you jump out of a book?  A book.  Someone wants to talk about a book.  Jump out of a plane, Jimmy?  I've thought about it, like, I would love it or hate it.  Like, I think I'd be...  I'm terrified of heights.  Yeah.  I think a plane would be easier than a building for some reason, because there's no man-made  structure, like, that you're falling past.  I don't know.  I don't know if I could do that.  I wouldn't even bungee cord jump. 
[01:13:30]  No, that to me is scarier.  Scarier than jumping out of a plane.  Yeah, because you'll die doing either one, but something about...  A plane...  Normally, the chutes are so well done that you have a couple of safety systems.  If bungee breaks, you're fucking doomed.  I did the swingy thing down the Jersey Shore.  Even that was, like, horrifying.  Pull your way up and then let you go and you fucking move forward.  Yeah, I was like, this isn't fun!  Yeah.  Although, by the third swing, then I'm like, okay, I can handle this.  Oh, yeah?  You got used to it?  The first one was fucking... 
[01:14:00]  And, of course, everyone laughed, because I was with family and...  You know, people that would eventually be my in-laws and really good friends.  They didn't really know me back then, and then I looked like the biggest fucking pussy.  Because I couldn't handle the swingy thing down the...  The swingy thing?  ...down the Jersey Shore.  I remember watching National Geographic years ago, when it used to be on Channel 13.  You know, you couldn't fucking...  There wasn't a channel.  Right.  It was fucking PBS.  And they had these natives in, like, South America, I guess it was. 
[01:14:30]  And they would take the vines and tie them up in these trees.  Oh, we saw that!  And tie it around their ankles.  Right.  And just jump out of fucking trees.  Sam, can you find that?  It was a version of bungee jumping.  But the bungee...  It didn't have the elasticity.  But it wasn't for fun.  It was some kind of thing they had to do to get into manhood, I believe.  Of course.  It's always that.  That and the big fucking carrot stick.  Well, the carrot stick dick is another tribe, I think.  Carrot stick dick, and then you had to do this fucking vine jump.  Yeah, yeah.  And they made the vine just short of the ground, I guess. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  But they were still fucking hitting their heads.  And it's not elastic.  I mean, you're not getting...  Have you seen this?  I don't know how they fucking...  You'll find it.  ...do this.  What is that, Australia?  Well, they built the tower.  It's all about...  Yep, here it is.  Can you put this on the Facebook page?  Oh, my God.  ...precursor of bungee jumping.  But here, it's considered a sacrifice for the survival of the community.  Of course it is.  What do you mean a sacrifice?  Chief Willie Orianbebe presides over his village. 
[01:15:30]  Are these aborigines?  Chief Willie's got a dress better still.  When they climb on the tower, they have no fear.  Oh, yeah?  Because it's their country.  They have no fear as they climb up the tower.  Dick is just swinging in the breeze.  Right.  To put the fear out, and then he must jump.  He must take an action to jump.  So they're climbing up this huge...  ...tower they built.  ...tower out of wood.  By some estimates, land diving dates back 15 centuries.  Its exact origin is obscure, but it is tied to the local religion of animism. 
[01:16:00]  How is it tied to religion?  People here believe in a world of spirits that demands...  Of course they do.  Savages.  ...divers would perform just after the yam harvest.  Oh, the yam...  The yam big harvest!  Another fruitful crop.  The yam.  And then they're tied to both legs.  That's an abrupt stop.  Do they die or live?  Pull their legs off.  They live.  Land diving rituals...  And they do it with little kids, too, I remember.  I saw this whole fucking thing.  ...supervises the tower's construction. 
[01:16:30]  I thought it was for a rite of passage with the manhood, but I guess not.  My father is still alive.  When my father died, and I took his place.  Uh-huh.  By jump day.  Nine minutes.  Just like building a skyscraper.  Jump day.  Oh, nice dick.  Was that a dick or a gourd?  I don't even know.  I know.  What the fuck is on there?  You don't even know.  So what does he do?  He jumps with these vines. 
[01:17:00]  Ah!  A vine breaks.  But this diver is lucky.  In the past, a snapped vine resulted in a fractured hip.  It's an abrupt stop.  I guess they're on a little bit of an incline.  Right.  And then they have mud there.  So if they fall, it's...  They have a chance.  I mean, it's maybe.  Oh, look at his horrendous tits.  The greater the blessing.  She must have been the ripe old age of 15.  With saggy titties like that.  That's a pretty fucking high jump. 
[01:17:30]  No kidding.  Good 60 feet.  Would you do this?  No!  I wouldn't even go there.  No.  Willie Warren is one of their best landowners.  Oh, oh.  He's like the star.  A rock is welcome.  The star is coming up now.  Yeah.  He's climbing up.  There he goes.  They tie the vines.  Jump out as far as he can to avoid impaling himself on the towers.  Oh, that's good.  Why wouldn't they build it where you can't impale yourself?  He urges on the singers.  Summoning support.  Oh, there he goes. 
[01:18:00]  And all their fucking dicks hanging out.  Why would they do that?  Dicks are wrapped tight.  You're going to impale yourself, dope.  Oh, what an idiot.  His good cheeks.  There he goes.  He's jumping and...  Oh!  Oh!  Did he fall?  Some break?  I don't know.  This is the dumbest thing ever.  Willie proves why he is a land dive champion.  Now he's fine.  He's strong enough to spring back on his feet.  An accomplishment few can match. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  And then he touches his dick.  They all grab their dick once they hit the ground.  I don't know what the fuck the deal is.  I want to make sure their gourd didn't come off.  They're very shy people walking around with nothing but a gourd on their dick.  You got to be a man.  Like a real man to just walk around with your dick wrapped and that's it.  That's crazy.  I'm going to just go to work one day and say, what?  Right.  I've decided to wear natural un-gap-fuh-woo-woo attire today to work. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, you can't fire me.  This is my right.  This is my new culture I'm adopting.  Right.  The gourd dick and fucking vine up my asshole.  Yeah.  Can we do that bit?  Who wants to come in dressed like the Valdebatra tribe?  Right.  We could all move to Peck-a-town.  Just say it's part of your new religion, man.  They can't touch that shit.  Right.  Yeah.  Come in.  Everyone's got to be nice. 
[01:19:30]  They can't comment on it.  I skydived three times on Long Island.  It was fantastic.  Carl did this on Idiot Abroad.  Oh, I think I did see it on Idiot Abroad.  Oh, right.  I love Idiot Abroad.  I'm a little behind, though.  I think I missed the last season.  You're up to three seasons now, right?  Yeah, he's great.  I've got to do a little On Demand and catch up on that one.  I skydived, but going over a building is terrifying.  Here's one.  Let's go to Matt in West Virginia.  He's got a good one.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I took one of those, you know, the first time skydiving, so you're strapped. 
[01:20:00]  Your rear end is strapped to the guy's crotch, and they fly up there, and he tells you, okay,  you're ready, and you step out of this onto, like, a one-foot-by-one-foot platform, and  he's still sitting in the plane, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And, of course, you can't hear anything, because, you know, the plane's going 100 miles  an hour, and I guess he told me it was time to jump, and, you know, it's 10,000 feet down,  so that first step is a doozy, and you want to make sure you do it right. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  And so, apparently, he had to, and, you know, I have, like, limited memory of this, but  he had to, like, hammer my arms off the wing of the plane to get me to take that first step.  See, at that point, they've got to go, all right, obviously, this is crazy for this poor  person, and let's just sit back down.  I wouldn't complain.  Here, keep my money.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I've decided that I can't do this.  I just wanted to put the outfit on and take a plane ride.  I wanted to see if I could do it, but I don't want anyone hammering my fingers, so I let 
[01:21:00]  go of my death grip.  They only give you about 10, 15-minute training course, and then it's like, hey, it's time  to go.  Is it, when you're falling, do you feel like you're floating or falling?  Because their arms are always out.  It looks like they feel like they're floating.  It seemed like I was falling, but I'll tell you what, it was really quiet.  You know, it was like, you don't realize how much noise is always around you.  And it's just, you're that far up in the air, and you can't hear the wind, but there's 
[01:21:30]  like, there's no cars, there's no, I hope not, radios, and yeah, but it was quiet.  It was definitely cool.  It was definitely cool.  I don't know, man.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  That's Matt in West Virginia.  Good story.  This is a paratrooper.  Well, that's a whole different animal.  Yeah, I mean, a bird that's in the military is nice.  Paratrooper.  Oh, no, I have another phone. 
[01:22:00]  There they are.  Whoa.  That's a new one.  Came back.  Al in Jersey.  Al.  Hey, guys, listen, I was a paratrooper, and I was scared shitless every jump, and anybody  who tells you they weren't is full of shit.  It was my job, but I was still scared as shit, because half the time you're dropping at night  into a hot zone, but if there's no fun and there's no grammar to it, it's just my job.  And I don't know why the fuck I did it, but, you know, you don't really look forward to 
[01:22:30]  it when you hit the ground.  You're happy as shit.  Yeah.  How many times did you jump in your estimate?  55 times.  That was mostly combat equipment.  It was nothing to do with sport or anything to do with leisure.  It was only we jumped when we had to.  You know, it was part of our operations.  From what height?  Yeah.  10 feet.  It's a range from 2,500 to 800 to 5,000. 
[01:23:00]  It's mostly military, which is all in mass, you know, there's about 64 guys.  Now, the special forces, they go up 10 grand, 15 grand, and the guys in 82nd, they jump a lot.  This guy's at 5,000 jumps.  I guarantee you, they're still scared shitless.  My brother was in 82nd Airborne.  Was he scared when he jumped?  No, he loved it.  He loved it, huh?  He fucking loved it.  He's a fucking wacko.  He is crazy, but he fucking loved it, man.  Is he trying to be cool by saying that, or did he actually love it? 
[01:23:30]  No, I think he was just young and fucking stupid and thought it was kind of fucking cool.  Yeah, there's people that love that rush, man.  Maybe it's an adrenaline rush or something.  I don't know.  Joe's like that, though.  Fucking motorcycles and fucking shit.  He just likes doing dangerous shit.  I bet his profile says, work hard, play hard.  Yeah.  No bag.  I think it would be easier if you're up there and, you know, the gag is, not a gag, but just  to make you wrap your head around the whole thing. 
[01:24:00]  The pilot comes on and goes, oh boy, we got engine troubles.  But you got the parachute on, so you're like, oh, fuck.  All right.  I'm out.  Fuck that.  I'm out.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  Then I think your whole brain would change.  The wiring would change.  I want to jump out of this fucking thing.  I absolutely want to jump.  Of course.  Maybe even, you know, do a little stall.  Yeah.  And then you'd be like, oh, okay.  We're having problems with the plane.  I want to get out.  Right.  They would get everyone out of that plane immediately. 
[01:24:30]  Because I bet you half the time they're like, oh, fuck, we got to deal with six brand  new people and, you know, this should take minutes.  But, of course, we got to spend another fucking hour up here before everyone's brave enough.  Jump, you shithead.  Right.  Because to them, it's just a job.  Pay for this asshole.  You know what would be really funny?  If the guy didn't want to go, so everybody on the plane just started singing Van Halen.  Go ahead and jump. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  You don't think that's a good one?  No.  Yeah.  Tony and Dallas did the bungee jump.  This is why I don't bungee jump.  Go ahead, Tony.  You were just flying a bomber.  My brain was saying, okay, I'm going to jump.  Oh.  The guy told me, do not jump first with your feet first.  And my brain said, yeah, no problem.  And it got up there.  And as soon as I went to jump, my body just said, let's just walk off this thing.  Right.  And I walked right off. 
[01:25:30]  And man, I had chiropractic appointment after that.  Wait, why?  Why?  If you jump feet first, do you hurt your back?  Because then, like, you're going to twist so much more when you run out of the bungee.  Oh, the bungee.  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  The bungee, you're all tied up on your ankles there.  So.  I think it was a plane.  I can't imagine that your body comes out of a bungee jump nicely.  Oh, no.  Well, it didn't this way, but I can't imagine either way, so.  All right.  All right, boys.  Thank you, Tony.  Go Cowboys, right? 
[01:26:00]  I am so happy the Giants stink this year.  Man, do I not pay any attention to football.  Oh, and three.  They got their asses handed to them, too.  38 zip.  When was that?  This past Sunday.  Oh.  Did someone play last night?  Yeah.  Monday Night Football.  I think it was Denver kicking Oakland's ass.  Hmm?  Yep.  Who's the big good fucking rocking team this year?  Denver.  Denver?  It was all right, yeah.  Is that who a bandwagon I should jump on?  Just say I'm a Denver fan?  I'm a Broncos fan.  I bleed Bronco Orange. 
[01:26:30]  Denver.  Peyton Manning's getting it done.  Jets looking all right.  Is he the pitcher?  He's the pitcher of the team.  We've got to get into this NFL thing.  Yeah, I don't think we're big enough.  Oh, I misunderstood.  We haven't talked about the kids jumping into that house and partying.  I'm fucking confused by that story.  Well, they're the ones that post called savages.  Oh, really?  Oh, right. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But now the guy whose house it was in is speaking up, and now he's a weirdo.  Oh, yeah.  What are the basics of this story?  And is this like a trend with kids, too?  I don't know if it's a trend.  I mean, I guess it always has been, but he's saying that he was out of town during Labor  Day, right?  Right.  And so a bunch of kids broke into his house and had a party there, and they found out  about his house, I guess, because he was trying to, at some point, have a get-together at  his house for veterans. 
[01:27:30]  And the kids would go and meet the veterans, and I don't know where that ties into this  story at all.  They were aware there'd be no one there, I think.  There's some details that are a little confusing.  But the kids get in the house and start partying, and then they start tweeting pictures and  stuff.  Correct.  Like, look what we're doing.  But now, his neighbor is saying that the house was in foreclosure, that guy hasn't lived  there in months.  Right.  And that part of him trying to get the damages is just to get him, because his house was  already all fucked up. 
[01:28:00]  Ah.  I see.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Ah.  All right.  Heisenberg's.  Heisenberg's house.  Brian Holloway.  Holloway.  Holloway.  He used to play for the Patriots, I guess.  When?  I don't know.  He's doing his interviews in his Patriots jersey.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, there's some weird shit going on with this story.  Fuck.  I gotta...  Hold on one second.  Lars is on.  It opens on every IMAX screen in America on Friday, and we've been working on it for  about three or four years.  It's a hybrid between a concert film and a dramatic film. 
[01:28:30]  Um, it's set against the background of a concert, and there's a dramatic story that sort of weaves  its way through.  Um, there's a, uh, runner, or roadie, as some people call him, uh, who's...  No, they all call him roadies.  It's played by the wonderful actor, Dane DeHaan, who, uh, is sent on an errand for the band,  and, uh, then things go terribly wrong from there.  Is this like Kiss in Central Park with the fucking...  Uh, it wasn't Central Park.  It was in California.  Oh, what was it called?  They met the Phantom of the Park. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, the Phantom of the Park.  Right.  Do you think of Purple Rain?  It's kind of a...  It's kind of a...  I mean, it's a similar thing.  Oh, my God!  You know, there's a...  Yeah, I mean, the wall...  Compared to Purple Rain.  ...is equating a large one back to the wall.  Yeah, like the wall, maybe.  Purple Rain to a degree, uh, we used the last...  Is it like my bodyguard?  Which is a sort of cinematic film.  I just want to see if that twat, Mika, is into this interview today.  She ain't even fucking gonna talk.  Miss Twatty.  If you're bringing something they've never seen, they like references in Hollywood. 
[01:29:30]  There's no real references for this movie, so it took a little while to get...  She's getting ready to be twatty.  So the band's been around 32 years.  Do we have to talk about music?  32, 50 years.  There's a great scene in the movie, Almost Famous, where Jimmy Fallon does this thing recently.  If you think Mick Jagger's gonna be still making rock and roll music when he's 50 years old,  you've got nothing coming, right?  Oh, my God. This guy knows nothing.  He's a nerd.  The archetypal most...  Something like that.  The most popular, most important heavy metal band ever.  Did you think 32 years ago, when you started Metallica,  that he'd still be making this music 32 years later? 
[01:30:00]  No way.  Oh, thank you, Mika.  Shut up, Mika.  ...was to have an IMAX movie and sit here and this NBC and talk to you guys.  Yeah, that was what we were striving to do.  That was what we were striving towards.  No, I mean, at that time...  That's a while ago.  ...I come from Denmark, grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark,  and I was never particularly goal-oriented.  I thought that was a very American thing.  So when I came to America when I was 17,  and everybody's like, so you want to make it?  What are you thinking?  What's your long-term girls?  I was like...  Sandman, Unforgiven, among top songs.  Oh, good information. 
[01:30:30]  Sandman.  ...be a little more impulsive.  The fact that we're still doing this 32 years later is obviously pretty crazy.  Mr. Sandman.  Enter Sandman, by the way,  because you said you weren't going to play tennis  because you're not that disciplined,  and yet look at you.  Yeah, and it's amazing.  I think she likes him.  The last three or four days we've been here in New York,  we played the Apollo Theater,  when did that happen?  Why wasn't I told?  When the hell did that happen?  Why wasn't I told?  When the hell did that happen? 
[01:31:00]  Why wasn't Jimmy allowed to get a picture?  Let's talk about Marianne Rivera for a second.  He's one of the greatest baseball players ever to live,  the greatest closer of all time,  and he comes in every time to entertain a man which he played live.  Oh, look at that.  I don't know if you heard that one, too.  I've heard most of them.  When did you know that he was doing it?  When did you realize it was kind of a big deal?  Well, it's been on our radar.  I mean, he's been doing it for about 15 years.  No, no, I know, but take it back 
[01:31:30]  to when somebody sprouts your attention.  This is so uncomfortable.  It's not like this is Metallica's big break.  They get to play for Marianne.  He's not a lot of left before the game.  He even watched the game.  We've been aware of that a couple, two, three months ago.  I tried to sue him, actually.  I don't like people using our music without permission.  Would you like to be part of it?  Obviously, at the All-Star game out at the Mets Stadium.  That was a big moment when he walked in  and had the whole stadium to himself.  The song played in its entirety for five minutes.  It's been pretty cool to be associated with that. 
[01:32:00]  We're very proud of that.  When you think back on the long arc of this career,  what are you proudest of in terms of what's the music  that right now, if you were...  Avoiding a photo with that annoying twerk.  Fucking over Jim's day.  ...and be considered somewhat relevant?  Oh, yeah.  Every time my teased you coming on the show,  people started...  Oh, my God.  Mika's a metal fan.  Yeah, she's...  Mika's inserting herself with nothing to say. 
[01:32:30]  She's a metal fan.  A big stainless steel dildo.  She is just...  Like, even faster.  No wheezing death metal.  Don't believe a word he says.  All right, Lars Ulrich, thank you so much.  Thank you for having me.  It's great to have you.  Look at that, huh?  She probably also knows how south the Russell Brand interview went,  so she's got her mind, her P's and Q's.  Yes, yes.  With these rock and rollers.  Yeah, yeah.  These young upstarts.  That'll make her look like a fool again.  Again.  All right, so ex-patriot Brian Holloway.  Yes.  So he finally went on Fox News to explain what the fuck's going on, I guess. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  And then this interview's weird.  So weird.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like, weird?  He's a weirdo?  Yeah.  He is a weird dude.  Yeah, so...  I still don't understand this story fully.  Yeah, all...  It's so weird.  The story is...  He's saying he left his house Labor Day weekend.  Right.  The kids knew it was going to be empty because he was planning this thing where they would  meet veterans.  They decided to take advantage of his good nature, and while he was gone... 
[01:33:30]  Right.  ...had a giant party in his house and tweeted pictures and damaged stuff.  Oh, boy.  So now he's going after the kids.  Sure.  But the neighbor is saying the house was already all fucked up.  But then he has something to say about the neighbor.  What's the fucking neighbor saying?  Oh, that's the great reveal.  Wait till you hear what he says about the neighbor.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  And then that becomes a whole thing.  And then...  Then they just want to fuck it off their...  Off their air.  Well, he won't stop talking. 
[01:34:00]  But he won't stop talking.  Oh, that's cool.  That's a really strange story.  He's on...  He's on the satellite...  It's a satellite interview.  Yeah.  And he acknowledges...  In space?  No.  No.  Oh, I thought he was in space on a satellite.  Not in the same state.  Oh, okay.  He acknowledges halfway through that he can hear them.  Uh-huh.  Halfway through.  But he refuses to stop any of his answers for their questions.  He's got a story to tell.  And he won't even start the interview unless he's allowed to do certain things.  Listen to the way he starts the interview.  Let's just try this out and see if he's a weirdo.  You had this event that you've been planning to have for wounded warriors or for veterans. 
[01:34:30]  And you were hoping that some of the party goers, the kids, would come back and help you  clean up and be a part of this event.  What has happened?  Okay, we're going to get to that in one second.  I've been giving you guys a lot of my time all week long.  I've got to take care of some family business.  I haven't been able to see my grandchildren.  They're watching me on TV.  Isaiah!  It's Pop!  I love you!  Who are you today?  Hey, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Melania. 
[01:35:00]  Talking to Iraq.  Gonna get you.  I can't wait to see you.  As soon as I finish up, Pop will come play.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  I got to do it.  Well done, Brian.  We like that you said that little television telegraph to your grandchild there.  Sure.  You've got to say hi.  We'll bill you.  Yeah.  Waste of everyone's time.  This guy is.  You're fucking voicemail over television.  He's just shouting at the kid.  Like how?  Yeah.  Like you can't just say, want to say hi to the grandkids?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get, you guys, I've been giving you guys my time. 
[01:35:30]  You made this a story.  Just shut up and clean the house.  Oh, this guy's an asshole.  I can tell already.  They're trying to get him to tell a story here.  But the biggest thing I want to say to those parents in the 300 right now, listen to me,  please.  The press is descending upon all of our lives.  We've got stuff we've got to get handled, and we're going to get to that.  Brian, hold on.  Let's get to that right now.  Hold on a second, Brian.  I know that you haven't experienced any of this before. 
[01:36:00]  Brian, when you say that we have something.  That will be your shield to protect you with the media, but it's going to get ten times  worse.  Brian, what do you mean?  You say you have stuff that we have to be handled by the media defending.  What do you mean?  And the people, you understand this?  All the other people, you get them together because we don't want to lose anybody.  Can I ask a stupid question, Brian?  How did these kids get in your house, and how badly did they trash it?  So, they broke into the house.  I can hear you now. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  Yeah, I can hear you now.  So, they broke into the house, yeah?  They broke into the house.  They probably did about $20,000 to $30,000 with damage.  I'm still assessing that.  Still assessing damage.  You can hear them.  He just tramples on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, here's where it gets good with the neighbor now.  Right?  The dumb neighbor.  Brian, TMZ, the celebrity gossip website and show, says that some of your neighbors are  saying that the home was already foreclosed on. 
[01:37:00]  It was already sort of falling into disrepair.  Can you respond to that?  Well, I only have one neighbor, and he's never been in the house, because I don't let  people that beat their wives in my house.  I don't let any man that puts their hands on.  Oh, my God.  Brian, we're not endorsing that allegation, and we have no idea where that's coming from.  We're definitely not going to involve him.  Well, I'm not going to respond to it, and I'm not going to be pushed around by any salacious  stuff that you're saying.  Salacious stuff that you're saying. 
[01:37:30]  We've had to do that a few times in our show.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  But he knows that he will stop being asked whether or not his house was in foreclosure if  he just accuses his neighbor of being his wife.  Yeah, yeah.  When this story first hit, it seemed like a very simple story, but it's just a weird  story, and this guy's a weird guy.  Yeah.  I still don't understand.  There's some shit going on.  Now it got to a point where kids were partying in his house.  I think his neighbor's saying it was an abandoned house. 
[01:38:00]  Like, everybody assumed it was abandoned because it was in foreclosure, and he doesn't live there.  But he's saying he was just gone.  Right, and this is beautiful right here.  Was your home being foreclosed upon?  My home was being foreclosed upon because I told them I'm not going to pay them.  They aren't going to sit there and call the note and push me around and not negotiate  with me like they were supposed to by law.  Look, there's obviously no reason, regardless of what condition a home is in, kids aren't 
[01:38:30]  allowed to come in and vandalize it anyway.  And so after the kids set up, and they vandalized the place, and they broke it.  Thanks, we get it.  Thanks for giving us an update.  We'll follow you on your website and see what happens.  What they're going to do now.  All right, we got to go.  We're going to black.  More Fox and Friends.  Three minutes from now.  That's racist.  I'm starting to think he deserves an asshole.  He's nuttier than a fruitcake, right? 
[01:39:00]  That's a good one, Chippa.  What the fuck?  You got him right there, Chip.  They probably are in the neighborhood.  They all know he's a dickhead.  Yeah.  And so they want to go party at his abandoned house that he left behind.  Yeah.  All right.  That's an odd little story.  Sure.  Strange, right?  Yeah.  I don't let people in my house to beat their wives.  Beat their wives.  Where did that come from?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  A little discrediting of the neighbor. 
[01:39:30]  Good ploy.  Getting ready for Stephen Merchant, James Caan, and Warren Haynes.  Very busy show.  The second half of this show is going to be extremely busy.  Yeah.  What's going on with the Burger King fries?  They're actually trying to have a, what?  Less fat, less calories.  But that's stupid.  Kind of crinkle cut, and they're going to cost, I think, 25 cents more than the regular ones.  But it's still bad for you.  Called Satisfries.  Satisfries.  Satisfries.  And you can tell it's different because it's crinkle cut. 
[01:40:00]  Right.  But it's still going to be horrendous for you.  Oh, no.  It's so much more healthy.  But if you have something that's horrendous, and then you say, well, here's a healthier version of the horrendous food, it's still horrendous.  It's still horrendous.  Right?  20% fewer calories.  Wow.  All right.  Well, how many calories in regular Burger King fries?  350.  350.  So 20% of that is what?  Two, well.  You go 70, so you go, what, 280? 
[01:40:30]  270.  Will contain 270 calories.  270 calories?  Size small?  I don't know.  Regular, I guess.  Whatever.  No, small.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm small.  Whatever is right.  So it's still 270 calories.  For a small.  That's for the small.  That's for the French fries alone.  And you've got to be a pussy to order a small fry.  Of course.  Fuck yeah.  Thanks, Chip.  Good one, Chip.  So what would a large be?  Like 400 calories, give or take?  Yeah, sure.  So most people get the large, better, healthier fries. 
[01:41:00]  It's a joke is what I'm getting at here.  So now you've got 400 calories and the better French fries.  That doesn't count the shake, the burger, and everything else you're eating that day.  So it's still a horrendous meal for you.  So what are they doing?  It's all the same ingredients, but they're adjusting the proportions of different ingredients  for the batter to block out more oil.  See, it's a marketing scheme.  I'm sure Burger King and some of these fast food restaurants see that their numbers are  dipping slightly because people are trying to eat better. 
[01:41:30]  So if you say that the food is healthier, but it's not actually healthy, you're going  to get them back.  Yeah.  The ER you add at the end.  It's a little I-E-R.  A little healthier.  Yeah.  That's all you have to do.  Add that.  But it's not healthier.  It's kind of like semantics, like you were talking about earlier today.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean it's healthy.  I don't think if you're going to Burger King in the first place, you're even thinking  about eating right.  But they're trying to get some of us that are.  Yeah.  They're trying to fake people out.  Dude, I would eat Burger King every day. 
[01:42:00]  Of course I would.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  I just can't do that.  But some of the people will be tricked and go, what?  French fries that are healthier?  Hmm.  But it's still not healthy.  And can you imagine going to the cash register and being like, I'll have an order of fries.  No.  Make that Satisfries.  Satisfries.  Ah.  Coming right up.  Yuck.  Matter of fact, make that Satisfries.  Ah.  I got a McDonald's, I think, in my neighborhood.  McDonald's Burger King.  I think it's McDonald's. 
[01:42:30]  McDonald's.  And they're trying to make it look like a Starbucks.  Anyone else have these in their neighborhood?  You mean a McCafe?  Is that what they're called?  No.  Hey, hey, the Irish deserve to eat, too.  They got that.  A McCafe.  They're trying to get people to hang out with their laptops in McDonald's now.  They got little lamps with brown, like really just nice brown tables where you can just  sit there, put your laptop out.  Kind of like that Starbucks feel.  McDonald's is so delicious.  Oh, it's fucking amazing. 
[01:43:00]  We know that.  Fucking quarter pounder with cheese.  Oh, nice big fries.  I like to dip some in the mustard and then some in the barbecue.  In the cum.  No, I don't do fries in the cum.  You don't?  No, I wouldn't.  No.  Make it too salty.  Are you sad that you just got a Tony Danza book signed yesterday after all that?  No, I'm annoyed that I didn't have my Tony Danza photo, but I wish I would have talked  to him, but I had to play that one out.  He was great.  We feel bad he didn't sign the cover, because I know you like the cover.  I don't care. 
[01:43:30]  He had to leave really quick, too.  The cover sign.  It was like, he got up.  Were we still on the air when he left?  Yeah, we didn't even get pictures.  Because we didn't even get a chance to take pictures with him.  I would have liked a picture with him.  He's very cool.  I've seen him in our thing.  Yeah, I know.  I don't bring it out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't even have a book to get it signed.  Yeah, we got yours, though.  I kind of wanted to...  He signed mine, Thoughts and Prayers.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Thoughts and Prayers.  It's funny.  His little catchphrase.  Yeah, we talked a little bit about that and stuff. 
[01:44:00]  How long was he on for?  Thoughts and Prayers.  Well, he did a good half hour.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a strong...  You shake his hand, though.  He's got like a man's grip.  He's probably going to still throw quite a punch, Danza.  For all those boxing years.  He's in perfect shape.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see the Thoughts and Prayers.  That's funny.  Next time we'll get the...  We felt bad because of the cover.  I don't care.  Thoughts and Prayers.  It's more like I did display all my books.  They never fucking signed it.  Oh, 2 Jim.  Thoughts and Prayers.  I think I have the picture today because Dugall never makes a mistake. 
[01:44:30]  I think I just sent it in wrong.  Let me show you the picture I have with Danza, which I wanted to get signed.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it would have been good.  Yeah.  This is from when he stopped in.  Stopped in here?  At WNEW.  Do you remember we had him on briefly?  Yes, he was in the...  No.  I swear, I don't remember ever.  We called him in.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This one, I don't remember.  He wasn't booked to be on the show or anything. 
[01:45:00]  I had...  Did he come with Joe Piscopo?  I know, right?  It was one of those.  Hanging together back then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember Tony Danza ever being on our show.  Let me see what he looked like back then.  Oh, yeah.  He looks...  Look at the cum on my shirt.  That is really cum on your shirt.  Oh, God, yeah.  I'll never forget that.  You've got to tweet that.  Yeah, I will.  That's funny.  Oh, shit.  Oh, so what...  Oh, man.  Oh, that picture wasn't here yesterday.  Can you see how light that is? 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  There was a fucking blow...  I used to blow loads on my shirt and wipe them off of my shirt.  And then wear the shirt.  He might have signed it over the jizz.  Right.  So he's almost lucky that...  You would have had to tell him,  don't sign it over that,  and then explain why,  and it would have been embarrassing.  I don't really care.  Really?  I dated one girl,  and we had an argument about Tony Danza.  She started a fight.  Because she said...  Oh, I'm sorry.  She said...  What she was talking about,  he was like,  yeah, he just kind of looks like he'd be,  you know, kind of dumb, 
[01:46:00]  but hung like a horse.  And I got insecure.  I'm like,  would you like me better if my dick was...  Oh, he's such a baby about it.  I'm like, what's wrong with me?  She goes, no, I'll take the dumb.  She's satisfied with your dumb.  Aw.  Well, you...  I know,  I was delayed with the picture.  You want me to sign the picture?  That's...  You told me you did the impression?  Because I'll...  I'll sign the picture if you want.  Why would you sign the picture?  Because it looked just like the book. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, did you sign the book?  Oh, that's hilarious.  That was a damn good one.  Oh, Jimmy.  It was odd when Opie said,  let me see the signature.  I didn't know how to get into it.  What, he just left without signing anything?  Yeah, he was in a rush.  And then we panicked.  We're like, oh, fuck, we didn't get you.  I just scribbled in it.  I just scribbled in it.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[01:47:00]  We should have let that go for a little longer.  I don't know.  What are you going to do with it?  That's fine either way.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers, you know.  I'm doing a musical.  He literally.  Singing and dancing.  He walked out as we were still in the air.  Dancing Danza.  It was very cool.  He'll absolutely come back, though.  He had a good time.  That was very funny.  We were scared to do it yesterday  with the whole Metallica thing going down.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was fun.  Yeah.  Were you going to get a picture with James Caan?  Yes.  I know.  I have my Godfather things to be signed.  One Godfather thing.  Oh, wow.  What do you got?  The, um...  I'll show you.  Mm.  Oh, the back.  Coming with, like, a garbage can lid.  Can you sign this?  I have this Godfather DVD collection,  but the back of it's got, like, all tape on it, 
[01:48:00]  so maybe I'll just...  Oh, no.  Oh, that's not good.  That's going to decrease the value.  Yeah, look.  There's tape on it.  I have to display it.  Maybe I'll just get to sign one of these things in here.  No, I would go out and get another Godfather.  Does he have one with his face on it?  No, but it just doesn't matter.  You still got time.  Go find another Godfather, I'm thinking.  Look at that.  Look at this.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah, but you want to sign the box so you can display it.  I can display that or anything.  It doesn't matter.  I don't know.  You want the cool Godfather logo, I think.  Do we have anyone that can go get us a Godfather?  I think you need to get a Godfather. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you got the time, you know?  Don't we?  Yeah, who can go get...  Yeah, we got time.  We got about an hour from right now,  so Jimmy needs a new Godfather DVD set.  One of our interns.  One of our interns.  Whatever they are.  Where can they get them?  It's unacceptable.  He can't sign that, Jimmy.  Well, this will be good,  because the intern that we have here  is the one who thought raspberries were strawberries.  All right, so this is a girl.  She's not here today.  He's going to get Jay Moore in Mafia and bring it to us.  All right.  E-Rock, can you send him out for the Godfather?  Yeah, see, it has to be done, 
[01:49:00]  and we got plenty of time.  Oh, yeah, that's all crappy.  Let's do this right today.  Yeah.  It's all sticky.  I'm glad I saw that.  It's makeup for yesterday.  Yes.  Let's get it done right today.  Or you could just color in that white part with a Sharpie.  Oh.  No, it's cheap.  Cheesy.  Why would somebody put...  Was that from the price or something?  It might have been, yeah.  Why would they do that?  I don't even know if they did it.  Well, make sure of the people that, whoever goes and gets your new one, that, you know,  it's like shrink-wrapped.  Pristine.  Pristine, yes.  With a fudge nose. 
[01:49:30]  Another dumb story.  I think it's the New York Thruway, I believe.  This is how they're trying to encourage people not to text.  They're setting up texting zones in rest areas.  All right.  Is that the dumbest idea ever?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So people can pull over because driving and texting is great.  Pull over.  They're going to have Wi-Fi.  So you got a nice Wi-Fi connection.  But who the fuck is going to stop just so they could not do what they could do in their car? 
[01:50:00]  Right.  Some people don't text to drive, though.  A lot of people I know with kids won't do it.  Like, no, I put my phone away because he's afraid he's going to hit a pole with his kid in the car.  I got way better after having kids.  And, of course, because the Samsung, you can't feel the fucking letters.  The BlackBerry was beautiful for that.  It's so dangerous.  You really knew what the keyboard was all about.  That's where Siri's got to come in and be better.  Like, the voice recognition stuff's got to be better. 
[01:50:30]  But do you think people are going to stop texting because there's an area off the Thruway where they can go?  I know.  And then they were interviewing someone this morning.  And they said the Wi-Fi isn't even set up.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  We've blown each other there in two weeks.  What are you doing?  We're just texting.  Meet me over here.  I'll suck you down.  They said the Wi-Fi is weak.  Yeah.  So it's not even set up properly.  I don't know.  Godfather, the Wi-Fi is weak.  I can't even get a connection.  Yeah, so I don't think people are going to do it. 
[01:51:00]  Who's going to get off the road?  I hate getting off the road.  When you want to get somewhere, that's the worst.  Depends on where you're going.  Like, if you're on your way to prison, you're probably like, just pull off and hang out for like five minutes.  I got to text again.  Yeah, I can't stand driving because I'm obsessed with making good time.  Making that good time when you drive.  And then you have to stop for gas or to get something to eat or a bathroom break or something like that.  And then you're on the road and you're passing people again that you passed like a while ago.  And it's like, I lost so much ground. 
[01:51:30]  It's okay if you pass, you know, regular cars.  But it's always like that thing that's going about 30 miles an hour and basically is hauling a house that you passed an hour ago.  And all of a sudden you're passing that again.  That's what really bums you out.  I don't know.  Yeah, fucking BlackBerry's done, huh?  Oh, I hope so.  They fucking did it.  They did their last ditch effort here.  They're just going.  That last phone was the, you know, the Hail Mary. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, now they're restructuring for just corporate use, period.  So now they want to be the official communication device of the corporations.  And they've already lost that battle.  But you've already seen the changeover to iPhones.  I don't know if, is iPhones the number one in the corporate, BlackBerry's probably still number one.  But iPhones certainly is catching up quickly, right?  I've never seen a company ruin something.  Oh, did they have it?  They fucking stink. 
[01:52:30]  They were.  Stop with the buttons.  We're going to keep it so people can feel the buttons.  Tactile.  Fuck your buttons.  Did you like the clicky screen that was like a button?  Oh, that was half button, half screen.  That was the beginning, that was the absolute beginning of the end.  The world decided a while ago they don't need the buttons anymore.  Fuck the buttons.  That's obvious.  But not BlackBerry.  They refused to see the signs.  I heard the guy who runs it was arrogant and good.  That's what you get.  How many employees are losing their jobs?  Was it 45,000 or 4,000?  What was the number again? 
[01:53:00]  It was about 45,000.  Yeah.  But they're going private now.  I've never seen a company that had like the fucking lead like that.  They were the phone.  XM.  That's right.  They were the phone, man.  I was all in with BlackBerry.  Remember the Pebble?  I loved it.  The Pebble.  Well, the Pebble might not have been a good idea.  I don't know.  It was cute.  I liked your StarTac.  I had StarTac.  That thing rocked at the time.  That was Boston, right?  Phone to half.  Yeah, that's when I was trying to get a phone.  And you weren't allowed.  But my ex-wife told me I wasn't allowed to have a fucking cell phone. 
[01:53:30]  You could have a car phone if you want.  I love this story.  But I don't want you to have a phone that you could carry around.  Why?  Well, I know why.  Because I'd be texting girls and probably sleeping with them.  That's why I am.  Would you ever tell her, shut the fuck up, I'm getting one?  No, that would have caused an argument.  That's why I just sat and drank.  That's why Anthony should be allowed to do whatever the fuck you want.  I agree.  Because I've been there with him.  I saw it.  It was uncomfortable for everybody.  You can have a car phone.  So I have the little piggly wiggly antenna on the fucking window. 
[01:54:00]  But then I look like an asshole because I'm pulling out my StarTac.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, she probably got in your ex's ear, too.  Why do you let him have one of those?  You know what that means.  That means he's cheating.  Oh, God.  Does it?  She was fucking awful.  What a fucking just...  What an albatross around my fucking neck that was.  Piece of shit.  Oh, God.  Would you say hi to her if you saw it today?  No. 
[01:54:30]  No.  Did you hate that you had to give her that money?  Yes.  I love the yes.  It's annoying, right?  Oh, it's terrible.  I don't want money.  Oh, man.  She blew through it anyway.  Fuck her.  Oh, cool.  Fuck her running.  I've had it.  Good thing I don't have to deal with that.  No cell phone.  You don't need...  What do you need a cell phone for?  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  It's fucking, you know, 1999, I guess it was. 
[01:55:00]  Whatever it was.  Yeah.  2000.  No.  Was it in Boston?  She said no.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe.  No, because I...  Well, then I didn't get...  It was definitely Boston.  But I didn't get a cell phone until fucking 99.  Did everyone have them in 94, though?  I don't remember.  I was...  I mean, I was late.  When I got my start...  Late to the party?  Yeah.  When I got my start tag, people already had pretty much most...  Not most, but a lot of people around me had cell phones ready.  Oh, yeah.  I was late, too.  I remember the first girl I texted. 
[01:55:30]  It was my...  It was a girl Florentine was dating her sister.  And it was the first text I ever said.  I was probably 31 to 32 years old.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Was it cock picture attached?  No.  There was no camera phones back then.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Oh, God.  There was none.  It was a flipperoo.  Pretty recently.  Remember when they put the...  You could take pictures of your phone, so the front was like that monochrome, little  tiny postage stamp screen.  Right.  So you could see the picture you're taking.  Yep, yep, yep. 
[01:56:00]  And then you'd have to open it up and look at the other screen.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not that long ago.  That's so crazy.  Dude, I know.  It's like you look at some of the old phones and...  You know what I miss?  And I think it was the stupid pebble.  After you were done with a phone call or a text or whatever, that snap.  When you snap your phone, I always had a folding phone.  I never had...  But it would just snap because it was like the magnets or whatever, and it just felt...  Yeah.  Felt good, like...  And then put it back in your pocket.  Funk.  And then you weren't fucking ass-dialing people. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  Like they were with the Nokias and stuff, where it was just fucking phone.  Constantly.  You'd answer the phone, and you'd just...  Cars.  The blinker thing.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Yeah.  But then you can't hang up, but you don't want to listen.  Because you want to hear if they're going to bash you or not.  But that was the scary part.  What?  What did they say about me?  Yeah.  It was always...  It was always a risk. 
[01:57:00]  You're so right.  It was such a risk.  Or when you realize you ass-dialed, and then you're like, oh, fuck, did I say anything?  What did I say?  Fuck.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  Both ways.  What did I say?  You realize people just have boring lives, though, when you hear someone's ass-dial.  Yeah, yeah.  Like you said, the blinker's a perfect example.  Oh, they're just out of light right now.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  Want to hear some just fucking heinous stuff.  Right.  Fucking beeping horns, some racial epithets. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, we got to bury that body.  Yes, that too.  Sure.  Get some good info.  You want to hear the I know guy.  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.  Those were the old, old days.  The old scanner.  I love the I know guy.  Yeah.  We were able to pick up the fucking cordless phones with the scanner.  I know we talked about that a lot, too, but it became a thing when we were in Boston to go to Ann's house.  It was better than going to a bar sometimes.  Just drinking some beers and listening to the fucking scanner. 
[01:58:00]  And listening to the scanner, but there was some creepy shit.  Remember the guy, like, well, yeah, okay, I'm at, I forgot exactly how it went, but he was up to some shady shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And he knew, even when he was on a cell phone, not to say too much.  Not to get too much info out.  Yeah, it's done, man.  I was there, and yep, I'm filling up now.  And, well, look, why don't we, I'll talk to you at blah, blah.  Yeah.  I'll be there in 10 minutes.  He wouldn't fess up.  And then the phone would just end, and we're like, what the fuck was that? 
[01:58:30]  It could have been some mundane thing, obviously.  The gay phone line was a great one, too.  Which one?  Ding dong.  Oh, right, right.  Hello?  Is it one of those chat phones?  Yeah, yeah.  I love that bit.  Yeah, I lived in an apartment complex, so a lot of people had cordless phones at the time.  Not even cell phones, just cordless house phones.  Right.  And it came over the, I guess, 800 megahertz, something like that, and it was picked up  by the scanner, and oh, my God.  Fucking fantastic.  Just hearing guys go, hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:59:00]  Ding dong.  Oh, oh, hello?  Is anybody in here?  Yeah, it would make a ding dong sound whenever a new person, like, logged in or called in.  So you'd hear, ding dong, and then, hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is anyone here?  A whole bunch of guys just go, hello?  Is anyone hanging out?  Hello?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  That was so fucking funny.  But the I Know guy is my favorite of all time, because I guess he got caught cheating.  Oh, yeah.  Him and his wife were on the phone.  And his wife was on the phone, and she's like, but you did to me and our family? 
[01:59:30]  And he's just like, I know, I know, I know.  How could you live with yourself after what you did to us?  He started low.  I know, I know, I know.  Were you guys laughing?  Oh, we were roaring.  Just because of how he said it.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Well, now you're going to have to live with that.  I know.  I know.  It's like drinking beer.  Thag it. 
[02:00:00]  And then the famous one where we listen to this one chick, and I forgot what she was  saying or talking about, but we laughed so hard we pounded Anthony's floor.  Yes.  But I forgot what it was.  Do you remember?  She said something, and we were like, this is hilarious.  And we did kind of a...  Like a ha-ha, you slap your leg.  We jumped up at something, and then all of a sudden she goes, those fucking neighbors  upstairs were like, holy shit, we're listening to the chick right below us. 
[02:00:30]  Constantly making noises.  They drank all night long.  Yeah, parts are like, oh my God, it's the woman that lives right downstairs.  So we went out on the patio and started throwing little things like a planter and stuff on  the balcony, so we started taking pebbles out of that and throwing them at her sliding  glass door.  She goes, I don't know, something's sitting on me.  There's somebody outside my sliding glass door.  She was horrified.  Yeah.  And we got her laid, because then all of a sudden the guy's like, you want me to come 
[02:01:00]  over?  Yeah, you want me to come over?  Yes, please.  Come over.  We're like, fuck, man.  And then we saw the guy arrive.  It was the weirdest shit.  Yeah, that was pretty fucking strange.  Yeah.  You know.  I think we had Jay, like, didn't he actually, he said, this is getting a little too boring,  so he actually went outside, went around your whole apartment complex to be in front of  our apartment and threw, like, something way heavier.  We did have Jay throw.  Okay, I thought so.  Yeah.  I forgot what it was.  Not to break the window, but just to really, really put it over the top. 
[02:01:30]  She had to throw a fucking rock through the window on fire.  God who takes it too far.  She fucking raped her and killed everyone.  All right, dude.  Oh, that's so funny.  He's a student.  It's just a stupid Saturday night.  We had nothing planned.  Yeah, really.  We're going to go out with the girls, that's for sure.  Night out with the girls.  What the fuck are you going to do with that?  I think someone did a pretty good job with their Godfather DVD.  So you don't need a new one.  You were working on it.  You were working on it that whole time.  Yeah.  That's good. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know.  I kind of still see it.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not done yet, but I'm just showing the improvement.  Take a Q-tip.  Dipped in a little alcohol.  Slowly circular motion.  Slowly.  That stick off.  I'm just using my old fingers.  God-given fingers.  We should jump into a break just because Stephen Merchant is going to be here any moment.  Oh, is he?  Okay.  I think so.  Yes.  So we've got Stephen Merchant next.  Right into James Caan.  Right into Warren Haynes.  Hopefully.  Excuse me.  Playing a couple songs for us. 
[02:02:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Continues.  Continues.  The guys are back for the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw Stephen Merchant out there.  I saw him.  Yes. 
[02:03:00]  He's walking in.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  I'm just annoyed about that.  Oh.  Fucking frustrating.  That is.  Just knowing.  Here he comes.  Yeah.  Mr. Stephen Merchant, take a seat.  Thank you.  Wonderful having you here again.  Thank you for having me.  Hi, John, a couple of times.  Yeah.  Always fun.  I do believe.  Always busy.  Always busy with new projects.  That's right.  Yes.  Good to see you.  There you go.  Comfy.  I'm just finishing off some kind of unhealthy breakfast.  It's not a cronut, is it?  We made the news the other day, boy, let me tell you. 
[02:03:30]  We know how to make news.  You guys made news over cronut?  Oh, of course.  I'm not sure it was national news, but go home.  Damn it.  Yeah, it wasn't exactly the big headline, but no matter what we do, nobody gives a shit.  But then Hugh Jackman's here, and he eats a cronut, and everybody fucking goes batshit  over it.  Yeah.  Oh, what a great radio show that is.  Yeah, Hugh Jackman came in, and then apparently the cronut guy was here, and he gave Hugh Jackman  a cronut, and Hugh Jackman loved it.  It was just one of those memorable media moments, like the Hindenburg disaster, and those things 
[02:04:00]  you remember for years.  I remember where I was when Hugh Jackman ate his first cronut.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And I'm trying to eat better, but he offered to share a little bit of his thing with me,  and I took it.  Of course.  If Jackman offers you some cronut, you take it.  I know, yeah.  You have to, right?  Of course.  It's creepy.  Such a handsome guy.  He's one of those people who's disgustingly handsome.  And sort of annoyingly talented.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  I'll just walk back in. 
[02:04:30]  What?  I just walked in.  What happened?  Oh, Jesus.  Appreciate that.  We were just talking about you.  Thanks.  It's so awkward to walk back in when the show's back on the air.  Actually, your new show is kind of about something like that.  You know, there's the popular kind of good-looking Hugh Jackman type.  Right.  And then you're a little more awkward, I think.  But you're out there.  In the game.  Sure.  Yes.  I'm more, I'm esoteric.  I'm more of an acquired taste. 
[02:05:00]  Esoteric.  There's the popular Krona.  Right.  The Hugh Jackman, if you will, that everyone enjoys.  And waits eight hours online to get.  Right, right.  And then there's a Dunkin' Munchkin or something.  Exactly.  You know.  Jesus.  We, uh.  Well, I was actually going to go for maybe sort of a, like, you know, sort of a more refined.  Oh, okay.  I'm more of a granola.  Oh, a granola.  You know, not to everyone's taste.  A niche-y.  Yeah.  But just as good.  Just as good.  A crawler, perhaps.  A crawler.  Yes.  Long and delicious.  There you are.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You guys are talking about cronuts, obviously. 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  I didn't try it that day.  I had great willpower.  Is that what it is?  I had to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy couldn't take not having a bit of cronaut.  A couple of men sharing it by some.  And then a souffle after that, let's not forget.  We shared it.  I ate a rip-off cronaut in Los Angeles.  Oh, no.  Because I guess the cronaut guy has maybe copyrighted the cronaut.  Oh, okay.  So there's lots of kind of imitation knockoffs.  Yeah, that are going around.  I mean, I don't know whether my consumption of an illegal cronaut could make some way. 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  I saw my guys on the street that go, cronauts, cronauts.  Watches, watches, cronauts, cronauts.  Yeah, the guy fucking opens a bag he's carrying.  There's just a bunch of sweaty cronauts here.  Cronaut.  Did you really walk through a window at Sarah Silverman's house?  Yeah.  Were you high or drunk?  You want me to tell you that story?  I'd love that.  Love it.  I went to Sarah Silverman's house for a party a couple of weeks ago.  I wasn't invited.  I went with other people.  And someone offered me some chocolate. 
[02:06:30]  In England, chocolate is normally chocolate.  Uh-oh.  In California, it doesn't necessarily mean that chocolate is simply chocolate.  And it was in a wrapper, like a Hershey's style wrapper.  It wasn't Hershey's, I should make that clear.  But it was in that kind of wrapper.  Okay.  It looked very official.  Um, I consumed some of this chocolate.  It turned out it wasn't just chocolate.  There was something recreational.  Yes, yes.  I, um, I lasted about 30 seconds.  I went into a hole from which I couldn't crawl out. 
[02:07:00]  Just a dark, kind of, the world just enveloped.  Wow, man.  Like within seconds.  I had a little lie down for a while at the party.  Um, one of my great concerns is like, is, is embarrassing myself in front of a big room  of comedians.  Well, yeah.  Comedians don't let you forget.  That won't be there forever.  And, uh, and, uh, for a while there, the, the lying down didn't help.  So I went in the bathroom and I stared at myself in the mirror.  That didn't help.  That doesn't, that never, that just makes things worse.  It's almost as bad as the guy in Poltergeist that stared in the mirror for a while and started 
[02:07:30]  picking his face apart.  Right.  Well, then I came back out into the party.  I thought I'd get a breath of fresh air and I headed for the outside area.  But the route that I took led me straight through an eight foot plate glass window, which  shattered in its entirety, um, just crashed around me.  Um, I was, I had like a minor graze on my hand, a little graze on my head.  Otherwise, miraculously fine.  I'm not quite sure why.  I think maybe because my feet are so big, they extend so far from my body. 
[02:08:00]  I feel like they make contact with it first.  It smashed and then my body arrives.  And then you end.  Perfect.  It's like a stunt.  And I sort of blearily kind of turned back and stared.  And the person I remember staring vividly back at me was Jeff Ross.  The one person you don't want to see you do something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Roadmaster General.  He's unpleasant to look at under the best of circumstances, much less when you're standing  there in blood and broken glass.  But what's extraordinary is I looked at a picture after the event and the glass was not  even transparent.  It was a dark brown color. 
[02:08:30]  It was.  So where were you going?  I was, I mean, man alive.  It was.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  Yes.  What was it?  I wasn't even, only the next day.  At that moment, I didn't know what to do.  I had no sense of what.  Where you just go like, oh, that's not a door.  Yeah.  I just, I just had no, I couldn't compute like what you do after that.  Yeah.  But what was in the chocolate?  Did you figure it out?  Was it hash?  Was it hash?  Hash.  But I thought it could have been more wild than I.  It seemed very.  You hate to think you'd do that just on hash. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  It's like, it better have been fucking LSD.  Exactly.  Maybe a little Molly action in there.  Oh, maybe, huh?  Or then some Mollies.  I sent Sarah an email the next day that said, thanks for a great part.  I had a lot of fun.  By the way, I don't know if you noticed, but I walked through a glass window.  I was, my big fear was that she was going to charge me for it.  Oh, man.  But she said it was insured.  Oh, okay.  That was nice.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  That's a great story.  She's got a story, too.  It was, well, it was insane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, thank God you weren't hurt.  And now we all know Sarah Silverman's a drug addict.  That's kind of cool, too.  Oh, my God.  No one said that. 
[02:09:30]  No?  Huh?  Now, of course, Hello, Ladies.  Right.  Is your show.  Your new show.  And please, what is it?  Tell us a little about it.  Well, I did a stand-up tour.  I remember maybe the last time I was here, I was doing a stand-up show here in New York.  And that also was called Hello, Ladies.  And it was mainly stories of my ill-fated romance scene.  Right.  And then I did the show in Los Angeles.  And HBO said, do you want to think about it as a sitcom?  And I said, yes. 
[02:10:00]  And then that's what we did.  Great idea, yeah.  And so it's basically me, not myself, but me as a kind of nerdy web designer trying to  score with the women of L.A.  As a fantasy of the kind of, of being part of the beautiful world of beautiful people.  How much of yourself, though?  None?  Oh, no, a percentage.  Yeah, yeah.  A percentage of me, yeah.  The cool guy part.  Sure, yeah.  Well, I, you know, it's like, it's bits of me from across the years, you know what I mean?  It's like, there's a little bit of the 15-year-old me, and there's a bit of the 25-year-old me,  and there's a little bit of the 38-year-old me. 
[02:10:30]  The younger you, as big an asshole as all of us think the younger our own selves were,  very embarrassing.  Yes, I mean, I feel like I'm still exacting revenge on him for being a loser.  God, man.  You know what I mean?  Like, everything I'm doing in my adult life is to sort of punish him for being...  Yes, we always talk about the fact that if we had that wonderful time machine and can  go back, we would just slap them still.  Of course.  It's like, oh, you idiot, you're embarrassing.  Right.  You gave me memories that I still fucking toil with. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Absolutely.  Oh, horrible.  I, I, um, but I also, but then did it make us the man we are today?  Yes, yes.  Thank God it made us the treasures.  We are.  We're national treasures at this point.  The perfectly stable treasures we are this very day.  I remember being, I think I was probably 16 years old.  My mother was working at a disco, you know?  Your mother was working at a disco?  She was working at a disco.  What was she doing?  She was a cocktail waitress.  She was pretty hot and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  So she was, you know...  That's a creepy thing to say.  It is very creepy, but I, you know, I knew the score. 
[02:11:30]  I wasn't fucking her.  I just knew she was kind of hot.  Her choice, by the way.  Not for want of trying.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  So occasionally I would go there because the drinks were free.  I'm broke.  I could go down there and get fucking hammered shit.  So I'm getting drunk and stuff.  Wait, how old were you?  I was probably 16.  See, that's, and that's normal for him.  I can imagine trying to find drinks at 16 at a disco.  That was great.  Served by your mother.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  But to him, this is a normal thing that we all do.  All the waitresses, though, knew me. 
[02:12:00]  You know, I was Rose Kids.  So I would go in there and, and, and get hammered.  And I remember one time I went a little too far, got really drunk.  And the coat check girl was like fucking, like, I thought she was adorable and stuff.  And she had to be maybe mid-twenties and I'm 16 and, and I was all drunk.  And I leaned over and I, I went, I love you.  And I went to grab her and spilt the drink all over her.  And to this day, that cringiness of thinking of it hasn't gone away. 
[02:12:30]  I still live with it.  I wake up like in the cold sweat, just sit up in bed.  And I said, oh my God, you could be married to a coat check girl.  Yeah.  That's another way to look at it.  Damn it.  No, I agree.  I, it's, you're just haunted constantly by, by the things that you didn't do, the things  you did do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The problem, I feel like, I feel, um, look, I wonder now in high school, when you get  to like 16, they should issue you with like a copy of that book, The Game.  Right. 
[02:13:00]  You know what I mean?  Or just something, just anything, just to give you some kind of help.  A little help, instruction.  Neil Strauss's pickup artist, fucking, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I just, I think, cause I, I mean, maybe if you have like an older brother or something,  maybe that's helpful, but I had no guidance.  My father didn't talk to me about sex or girls.  No, you're out there blind.  Working blind.  And I didn't, didn't know, there was no, the internet now, I guess.  Maybe you just go on there and that gives you everything you need to know.  I would imagine.  You can't go to the library.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look up, I have to pick up girls.  But even so, the internet gives you the opportunity to make that first, you know, breaking the ice and, 
[02:13:30]  and building up a rapport with somebody before you even have to meet them.  And if you fail miserably, it's not face to face.  You're not embarrassed that much.  Not at all.  Uh, you know, I wasn't even thinking of it as dating online.  I was thinking of using it as a research tool.  Just as a research tool.  Yeah.  Which also works.  Sure.  You know, but, uh.  Because apparently I was reading something in some, in some, and I, it was, it sounds like it's going to be a trashy article.  It was actually in a high class publication.  I forget which.  But they were saying that, that pornography is having a real impact on, on young people.  Now, because they're watching it. 
[02:14:00]  And, you know, it was hard when we were young to get access to pornography.  To even get it.  It's crazy.  You could never get it.  You had to, you know, get a VHS tape from somewhere, from a man.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, it was hard to watch it.  And now you just go online.  And people now, like, apparently young people are thinking that you just keep, you're constantly switching partners.  Yes!  There's two at, there's two at once.  They, they're very knowledgeable, uh, on things, uh, and, and, and I remember going, being in like a garage and you're moving something and, and you see a stack of porno mags.  And it, it, it glowed like the case in Pulp Fiction. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  You're just like, oh my God.  Because that's how you found them.  Yeah.  You couldn't buy them.  So you had to find them.  Right.  Under a pile of leaves in the woods or wherever you are.  You just have to wander through life hoping you'd find them.  And now it's like, I want to see the most disgusting thing you could think of.  You know, you go to jibnorton.com.  Believe me, I was ready to fire out a Miro joke.  Of course.  Of course, you continued and smashed me first.  But you wanted around the woods.  We did trash day.  Trash day.  With our bikes. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Up and down the streets.  And you just waited for those piles of newspaper and magazines.  And every once in a while you cut that free and you would found the gold.  Buried in there?  You would find the gold inside.  The gold.  But you would leave everyone's trash a complete fucking mess because you didn't put it back together.  It's beautiful stories of old American life.  Yes.  American life.  Which they've gone now destroyed by the internet.  The Norman Rockwell years.  The Norman Rockwell painting of the kid finding porno.  That would be really funny.  Just to do a Rockwell-esque painting of just the kid finding porno. 
[02:15:30]  The kid finding some porn.  Big smile.  You would have to hit at least 100 houses.  But there was always one that would throw away some old magazines, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, we found it.  Well, that's cool.  You were mining for it.  Absolutely.  The Bill Devane of porno.  Well, if you have a paper out, you're already, you know.  You're halfway there.  In that world.  You're halfway there.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something about the smell of musty, like when you'd find them outdoors, they'd been  rained on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The smell of that musty fucking outdoor magazine.  It brings you right back.  It brings you right back when you smell that smell.  You'd have to turn them gingerly so you didn't rip the damp page. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Lord.  The best.  And there was really no place to go.  You didn't have your own space to go at this.  Oh, no, of course.  So you needed a tree fort or a shed in the backyard.  Well, if you were lucky enough to get hold of a VHS tape, you had to wait for your parents  to go.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  You couldn't just pop down when your parents were watching Columbo.  Oh, my God.  You had to wait until they went out.  But freaking it would run out the projectors at school.  Oh, that was...  For porns.  Well, that was pretty brilliant, too.  Just a tad before the whole, like, when I was first noticing that I kind of liked girls 
[02:16:30]  and stuff, VHS, not so much.  Okay.  Little, like, films.  What?  Eight millimeter films.  Wow.  That makes it even seedier.  It was seedy.  But we didn't have an eight millimeter projector, so we went to the school and talked to the  AV guy into lending me a projector so I could take it home and invite my friends over and  watch something.  You really had to study Africa.  That's a stag film.  Yeah, it's just something about having that projector, like, having to draw the curtains. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, that's what it was.  Draw the curtains.  You're feeding it through the little...  And you'd hear that.  The sprockets, like, didn't align properly.  Yes!  Yay!  Oh, my God.  It was dirty.  So dirty.  And what were the...  What were porno films like in the...  It was just...  I remember this one.  It was very dark.  It was...  No, it was in color, but bad, like, washed out color.  And it was some woman disrobing.  Sure.  Uh, she was on a couch, standing on a couch. 
[02:17:30]  It was too far away.  Like, there were no real close-ups.  And then some guy came in who looked, like...  Yeah, he looked Turkish with the body hair.  And just went at her.  You remember it so vividly.  Oh, yeah.  It was amazing.  It was great, you know?  I was the hero that day.  Sure, of course you were.  By the way.  What's better than...  You remember the weird textural thing?  Like, I remember...  You remember hardcore, glossy ones that you'd find?  Like, there was a softcore magazine.  Oh, yes, yes.  But then there was a hardcore... 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  The hard...  The high-gloss, like...  The pages were very thick.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, they had a nice fucking...  Did you see insertion?  Like, they didn't show that in, like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the hardcore.  That was like finding friggin' a gold mine.  Sure, that's a gold mine.  Yeah, yeah.  We might have went too far with Stephen Merchant.  Oh, no, he just gave a G.  I know, now we get it.  He just gave a G's.  We started talking about hello, ladies, and we get into this.  How did we get into that?  I know.  That was my fault.  I think I segued into it.  Our 15-year-old us, and then we never advanced to the other ages.  That's the thing. 
[02:18:30]  We're still talking about this.  This is why, if we'd had a healthy sex life as teenagers, we wouldn't have been talking  like this, Robbie.  Exactly.  How old were you the first time you were late?  Oh, late.  It was late.  I can't even remember.  I was 18.  Oh, I was later than that.  I don't even really remember it.  I feel like it was like, it's not like a moment, it was just like a slow blur of time.  You know what I mean?  Like at some point, I was no longer a virgin.  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't really remember any specific moment.  I was 18, too.  Late 18, college.  Wow.  I think it was university for me.  Wow, really?  Were you having oral sex first? 
[02:19:00]  I was having oral sex before that.  No, none of that.  That was, see, this is so weird.  Back when I was growing up and trying to get laid, oral sex was, that would come after  regular sex.  Like a girl was more apt to have regular sex with you than have oral sex.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, weird, right?  Now it's like, oh, this is, you know, oh, he's taking me out tonight.  I had no opinion of any of this.  No, huh?  It was all just a weird, mysterious thing. 
[02:19:30]  Believe me, I don't want to sound like I have some great sexual prowess back then.  It was a big mystery.  No, it wasn't with you.  No, it was.  His father got him his first lay.  Oh, that's, you're one of those creepy ones, are you?  Well, I didn't know.  But he was young.  He was like 14?  Yeah, like 13 or 14.  Well, she would be over the house all the time.  But then, like, on my...  Who's she?  This girl, Buzz.  Her name was Buzz.  Buzz.  She went to the moon with Neil Armstrong.  This is such a creepy story.  It was Buzz.  And your father was bringing her around? 
[02:20:00]  Well, the worst thing that could possibly happen in my father's head was that his son would  be a faggot.  Right.  So, uh...  Lo and behold.  Turns out that wasn't the worst thing.  So, as I was out in California with him growing up, he would, you know, put me in man training  kind of things.  Sure.  Like, you know, have beer, sit on the back of a Brahma bowl for eight seconds, shoot guns,  like, do all these things. 
[02:20:30]  And then, at one point, it was like, all right, he's...  You know, and he probably sensed I was spending a little more time in the bathrooms than I  usually used to, so...  But at 13 or 14...  And you were cleaning your gun.  Right.  Yes, yes.  But at 14, that's the part I don't...  Well, yeah.  No one knows what the fuck's going on yet.  You're all over the place.  No, no.  But, you know, I had the want, of course, but then I didn't have to deal with trying  to figure it out, because there was Buzz.  Buzz would be around.  Buzz was 19.  She was a friend of the family. 
[02:21:00]  She was always hanging around our stable.  She was a friend of the family.  Go get her.  We had horses and stuff, so she would always hang around the stable and, you know, drink  and knew the whole circle of friends, which she was at all the parties and everything.  She was...  And she didn't look 42.  No.  She could have passed for 30 seconds.  Exactly.  She was a little weathered.  Ridden hard and put up wet in the equestrian circles, we say.  So, yeah, I guess my father had set it up with her that, all right, we're going  out, and then you stay home with Anthony, and, you know, whatever happens, happens. 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  So she was like, oh, go upstairs, take a shower.  I was like, oh, okay.  She just told you.  Yeah.  I go upstairs, take a shower, and I come out of the shower, and I just think I'm going  back downstairs to watch TV.  Yeah.  With Buzz.  Yeah.  And I hear, oh, you're coming in from one of the bedrooms.  You're coming in.  I'm like, well, what is she doing?  This is amazing.  Why?  Why?  And then I was like, oh, man.  Like, then it hit me.  Yeah.  Like, oh, shit.  So I go to the door and look, and she's sitting up in the bed with the pillows against her back. 
[02:22:00]  So she's sitting up with the sheet, like, at her waist, and she had these big old buzz  tits.  And it was like the first real live tits I saw.  I was just like, holy shit.  Yeah.  This is it.  We're going in.  Well, it's funny, because one of my fantasies when I was younger was always, I used to watch  a lot of James Bond films, and invariably, James Bond would come back to his hotel, and  like, whoever the seductress was, would sort of, there'd be a trail of clothes from the  sort of door, and then she'd be away from me in the bed.  Yes.  And I always used to think that would be a fantasy. 
[02:22:30]  Even to this day, I've never come back to a hotel room.  Even when I was dating someone, and they knew that was a fantasy, I'd never come back,  and they were waiting for me to try to do this.  Never, never.  The idea that that basically happened in your own house?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  You just assume that's how girls took their clothes off.  Right, right.  They started at the door.  Right, right.  Of course, the shoes come off.  Right, right.  Wait, I got a question for Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard that story a lot.  Yeah.  When did your dad finally tell you that he set that whole thing up?  Oh, the next day.  What did he say?  It was the next day.  He was like, so, how was your night? 
[02:23:00]  And you were like...  I was like, oh, but I didn't want to talk about it.  So I was like, oh, good, good.  So, did he pay her?  No, she just was, you know...  She was into it.  She would do anything.  Was he fucking her, too?  I don't know.  I think he probably threw one in her at some point.  You shared a girl with your dad technically.  I think everybody.  That's a little strange.  I've heard a guy do that before.  This is horrific.  I didn't know.  But then, like, she would come over before I would go to school.  Like, for like a year.  What?  She would come over, like, occasionally, maybe once.  You're living the dream.  Twice every couple of months and stuff like that.  And then, you know, she's like, oh, I want to eat it. 
[02:23:30]  And then she'd, like, go down on me and stuff.  And I'd be like, I've got to go to school.  This is me.  I want to eat it, she'd say?  Yeah.  You're cum?  Yeah.  And then she'd go to...  Jesus.  And then I'd finish up and run off to Marco Forrester Junior High.  This is one of the most distressing things I've ever heard.  No wonder you've turned out like you have.  Yeah.  Man.  It was crazy.  Well, you're not going to relate to this show, this TV show about a guy who can't get laid.  I mean...  Well, no, no.  Look, it was very...  I hope things dried up for a while. 
[02:24:00]  Once your father stopped organising it.  Once I moved back to New York, that was a whole different animal out there.  This was California, circa 76, 77.  Right.  He puts you down a bad road, man.  I don't even know how you concentrate in junior high knowing what's waiting for you.  Oh, it was great.  But I kept my mouth shut.  Not like these kids now.  They get teachers and everybody in trouble.  You kept your mouth shut.  I kept my mouth shut.  I knew I wanted that before school.  I didn't want my father to go to jail.  Yes.  That's fucking... 
[02:24:30]  Now you look, it's like this hot teacher is having sex with a 15-year-old student or  something like that.  And they get in trouble because the guy says something.  How is that happening?  What teacher?  I know.  It's like getting some alone time with a pupil.  And then they're having a flirty conversation.  You know what I mean?  There's so many stages before you get to that.  Right?  It's so weird.  Yeah.  I don't know how that happened.  And then you got to trust the pupil to not tell anybody?  Yeah.  Not rat you out.  That's crazy, man.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  But you're so seduced by his charm and sophistication. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  While you're grading his papers, this essay is beautifully written.  Such delicious handwriting.  He's talking about me.  Yeah.  These are my feelings.  It's like his summer vacation.  How bad did you want to talk, though?  Well, all us kids would get together.  The guys, and when we talk about sex and stuff, and they were all, you know...  But you never brought...  Yeah, sure.  That's where you put it.  You know?  And I'd be like, oh, yeah.  I'm sure it'll be great.  You finally told them?  No.  God.  I told Richard...  I would have fucking blabbed. 
[02:25:30]  My best friend Richard, who turned out to be gay and tried to have oral sex with me  in our tree fort.  Wow.  But Buzz always wanted to have a little party with me and Richard.  And Richard would always say, no, no, no.  What happened to Buzz?  What happened to Richard?  To Buzz.  Oh, to Buzz?  Buzz moved to San Diego and married a sailor.  So she's still around.  I guess.  She probably listens to this.  Have you changed her name for the purposes of rural customers?  No.  Yes, it was Frank.  Her first name was... 
[02:26:00]  Her real first name was Christine, or Chris, you know how we call it.  But she was called Buzz.  So if she's out there, she should call the show.  I would love to talk to Buzz.  That would be amazing.  Oh, my God.  That would be amazing.  Talk about the last probably decent lay I threw anybody.  We turned this interview into, like, therapy instead of, like, pushing Steve and Merchant's...  I know.  We're supposed to be talking about Hello Ladies.  Well, we have a crack staff here because Hello Ladies premieres September 29th at 10.30  a.m. on HBO. 
[02:26:30]  That's definitely not the case.  I don't think that's true.  Wow, they gave you a horrible time for the show.  What a terrible time slot.  Oh, that's right.  It's a p.m.  Yeah.  That's a weird time for an HBO show.  Is that being sent from my crack team, or is that yours?  No, that's us.  Believe me.  No, it's us.  And, of course, it's Steven Merchant on Twitter, but it's S-T-E-P-H-E-N.  Did we do the show justice?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It's very funny.  Thank you.  The awkwardness is very relatable.  Yeah.  Except for me.  Of course.  Don't play it like you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, it's very, very funny.  Well, you know, to me, it was like, they said to me about sitting in New York, in Los Angeles,  and that was the thing that kind of was appealing to me because there's something about, and  I don't know if this is true of, I'm sure this is true of a lot of American people as  well, but certainly when I was growing up in the 80s, you know, and we talked about the high  schools and everything.  Like, the idea of California, particularly Los Angeles, was this preposterous fantasy.  Like, you'd see it in TV shows, and to me it's like, it was soundtracked by, like, music  that had a lot of saxophone in it. 
[02:27:30]  So, consequently, in the show, like, we've had a hint of, like, saxophone music.  Oh, that's great.  And we have a credit sequence that kind of subtly evokes, like, the moonlighting credit  sequence, shows, you know, that idea of, like, that there was kind of, I always imagine  there's women in, in kind of mink coats, kind of getting out of limousines, going through  red velvet ropes into kind of VIP parties.  Yeah, yeah.  And sort of the playboy mansion, and this very, this very kind of, this, I guess, like  a kind of, like a playboy, uh, fantasy of what, of what sort of adult sophistication 
[02:28:00]  would be.  Right.  You know, men in smoking juggies.  Yeah, that's adult sophistication.  Yeah, adult sophistication was, right, right, exactly, exactly, yeah.  And the, and the, and so that was the, it seemed exciting to me, the idea that he, he's  this kind of loser from England who's come to Los Angeles and has some success, he can  afford a house and a car and things, um, and that somehow this will buy him entry into that  world.  That magical world.  That magical world, yeah.  And of course, that magical world does exist to some degree, but it's not open to the likes  of you and I.  No, that's.  You know, and I've got my own TV show, and it's not open to the likes of me. 
[02:28:30]  I'm amazed by how I'm still turned away from things when my billboard is on the street  opposite.  Right?  It's extraordinary.  Is it frustrating, though, because you were part of, you know, I think one of the great  shows ever, uh, and you were a huge part of the original Office and writing it and creating  it, and you know, it was not just Ricky, it was you two, but he happened to be in it.  Right.  Um, is it ever frustrating where you look at, like, fuck, man, like, he gets all this  accolades from it, and they don't understand that I was also a big part of that?  I don't, I never felt frustrated that I didn't get enough, uh, accolades, um, because for 
[02:29:00]  people like you who knew about the show and were fans of the show, then they, they, they  knew my involvement.  It was more that, that doormen at clubs and, you know, cocktail waitresses didn't know  who I was.  Yeah, hey, asshole.  That was what frustrated me.  I, I remember going to Los Angeles around the time we, we won a Golden Globe for the  show, and it was very exciting, and I remember someone put me on a list that week for a club,  and I was on the list, and I went to the club, and, uh, and I said, I'm on the list, and  the guy went, which list?  Oh, shit.  And I was like, how many lists are they?  They went, there's two.  I said, could you check both? 
[02:29:30]  He went, no, I ain't got time.  Oh, shit.  Right.  And I just stood there like a lemon, just stood up by this rope, and I just, and I couldn't  persuade the guy to, to check the lists.  And other glamorous people were coming through, and in the end, I just had to, like, sheepishly  walk away.  Uh-huh.  And, and even when I'm on the list, I'm not on the list.  Oh, my God.  And, and, what do you do at that point?  What do you, it's like, hey, have you ever seen the original British version of The Office?  Yeah.  Well, I was one of the writers.  Like, it's not a suit. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Too many steps.  The list of people that were in the, you know, doesn't work.  Very cool.  Well, they say, Stephen has to leave, but, uh, the show.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's, uh, Hello Ladies on HBO, uh, 1030, September the 29th, which is a Sunday?  That's Sunday, yeah.  Sunday, which is an amazing time slot.  It's a great time.  Yeah, we'll all be watching, of course.  And, uh, I'm sure it'll be a hit, because everything you've done has been brilliant.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  What a lot of fun.  Thanks, Stephen.  Always great having me on.  I do hope you get in touch with Buzz.  Yes, I want Buzz on the show. 
[02:30:30]  I feel free to forward me her number.  That's very cool.  Thanks, man.  James Kahn's outside the studio.  Is that who that is?  Who?  James Kahn's outside the studio.  All right, let's just bring him, uh, bring James right in.  Yeah?  Had to have one more bite, didn't you, Stephen?  That's good stuff.  Wait till not, we'll go.  Yes.  Take care, man.  Thank you, Stephen.  Bring James Kahn in.  Stephen Merchant, everyone.  Thank you.  Here goes Stephen.  He's fun, man.  Yeah.  I like Stephen.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that is James Kahn.  He looks good.  Yeah, he looks great.  Fucking, look at him. 
[02:31:00]  Tough guy.  Whoever's listening to us out there that works for the show, can someone bring him?  Is that okay to hear us?  He's having a conversation with somebody.  I think it's more than James Kahn's having a conversation.  Rollins on it.  Yeah, he's like, ah, whatever.  Rollins on it.  He's like, I'm James Kahn.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Now he's walking the other way to try to get in the studio.  All right.  Now he's talking to that guy.  Now he's turning his head.  He's still laughing at that guy.  Now he's making his way into the studio.  Here we go. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, James Kahn.  There he is.  James Kahn.  Hello, sir.  Is it?  Is it?  I'm freezing my ass.  It is.  Not here.  Summer's over.  Which one of you guys is friends with Mark Cullen?  Any one of you guys?  Mark, uh, Cullen.  I know the Cullens.  Jimmy.  Rob Cullen.  Yeah, Rob.  Jimmy knows him, yeah.  What did you think I said to start with?  Mark.  Did you say Mark or his brother?  The Cullen brother.  Rob.  Yeah, no, I know him. 
[02:32:00]  No, that's it.  No, then I'm in the wrong show.  No, I said, I do know him.  He said he was a good friend.  That can't be you.  Rob Cullen, yeah.  No, if you say I know him, that would indicate that you're really not like a good friend.  No, I am.  Rob Cullen, his brother, I think his name is Mark.  Did one of them produce your show?  True.  Yeah, the show were...  Oh, okay, yeah.  Then I do know them.  Okay.  So maybe...  No, it's me, Jim.  I thought you'd go whoopee-doo, because he said make sure you say hello to him.  I'm just...  What's your name?  Jim Norton.  Sure, that's him.  Yeah.  I'm just happy to see...  I'm just happy to see James Conn. 
[02:32:30]  That's all I...  I'm very happy you're here.  Yes.  I kind of shocked you.  Yes.  I understand.  So what's your show yesterday?  I get it.  You get it?  A little bit.  Oh, I got to put these things in.  A little shocking.  You don't have to.  Yeah, yeah.  You do whatever you want.  Wear in the same room.  I swear to God, I walked out of the hotel and people thought I was in there.  It's a little cold today for a t-shirt, James.  Ah, not when you're tough.  Tough guy.  Tough guy.  God damn, you look great, man.  Thanks.  Not you, Jimmy.  Oh.  And this is without makeup, too, bro.  Yeah, I know.  That's why we like you.  You're very naturally handsome.  Thank you very much. 
[02:33:00]  The show...  Promote the show.  It's called Back in the Game, and it premieres tomorrow night on ABC at 8.30.  And I saw the pilot episode, which is you play the father of a girl and the grandfather  of her son.  And there's some really amazing dialogue considering it's ABC.  TV has changed.  Oh, no.  We're going further.  You're going for it?  We're trying to move the show after the Kimmel show.  It'll be like 12 o'clock. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  ABC, we give them like three horrible things, figuring, well, they could only lose two of  them.  I've heard that from everybody.  They say that.  They give them a couple of options that they know they're going to throw out just so they  go to the one you wanted in the first place.  Disney, I mean, and it's 8.30.  We want to go on later.  But these colors, I mean, and the whole writing staff is great.  I mean, it's really fun.  So, I mean, I'm actually having a lot of fun with it.  And that's kind of...  I mean, racial, terrible. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, and I play a guy who just doesn't give a crap.  I'm trying to create the most horrifying guy that is ever on television.  Nice.  Yeah.  But with a heart.  Oh, okay.  With a heart.  It's like you never see it.  Deep down.  You never see it.  No, he raises his daughter, like, from the time she was 8, you know, as a guy.  Right.  Oh, shit.  He lost his...  Because he was a baseball player.  He was like the second coming of Sandy Koufax for 11 minutes.  He drank himself out of the league, blew his arm out. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  So he raised his girl to the point where he called a junior.  That's healthy.  And there's a couple of ideas.  What do you...  And then she's forced to come live with me.  She hates me.  Way after she gets divorced with her husband, from her husband, as opposed to an elephant.  And brings, you know, my grandson out, who I never called the right name.  And they move in with me, you know.  And he's terrified.  And every time the kid, you know, I give him these life lessons. 
[02:35:00]  Some kid's bully.  I look.  Walk up to him.  Right.  Flick your lick secret over his arm.  You see how he turns.  He said that many times.  You hit him across the knees with his back.  The kid is great.  He goes, I'm not hitting a kid with...  And I don't smoke.  He goes, it's just...  It's just the same.  That sounds like advice my dad gave me.  My favorite line.  She comes up.  She goes...  I'm asking, well, how quite...  What are you talking...  Bring me up like a guy.  And he's bringing me up like a guy.  I said, what are you talking...  She says, well, I got my first period. 
[02:35:30]  You told me to walk it off.  Well, there was no internet then.  I know.  So, it's pretty...  It's pretty...  The language is amazing on this.  The things they say.  I'm like, I forgot it was ABC.  It feels more like an AMC show or something.  It doesn't feel like network television.  But you know what?  Some people who complain, say, geez, you got kids on the street.  It's not about baseball.  Baseball is like 20%, but it's sort of like the social club where you meet everybody, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  The parents are...  And we got kids that are amazing.  Not actors. 
[02:36:00]  Other than Griffin, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And Michael, they're real kids.  I mean...  And they haven't got one ounce.  Not one gene of athleticism in them.  Not one.  So, look at me.  They'll never win a game.  If the show goes 20 years, they will not win a game.  Maybe a run or two.  Where'd you get the kids from?  Because it's...  They hit the thousands and they just took real kids.  Because you're hitting on something.  It takes me out of so many movies now and TV shows because these kids were brought up in acting. 
[02:36:30]  So precious.  And you can tell.  Yeah.  But you can tell there's something that they're missing.  You want to slap them in the mouth.  Yes.  Because you can tell they're just acting.  I know.  My kid is the best kid ever.  He brings me a shirt like one day because there's just no beer, no dad.  You know?  He's just like, I just drink beer all the time.  Call him the wrong name.  I mean, but there's things we make up.  Like, he comes in.  He has to be like he's in love with this girl.  That's why he wants to play baseball.  Because...  He's trying to get laid. 
[02:37:00]  No, because he loves this girl and she likes ballplayers.  So, that's that whole thing.  He comes one day and he asks about...  This is one of the shows about sex and stuff and girls.  I go, go talk to your mother.  You know?  Kershaw's fishing.  You know?  Leave me alone.  So, he says, I can't talk to him.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, now he convinces me.  And the first thing I say is, look.  With one hand, you got to learn to do this.  You come around.  You have to unhook the bra with one hand.  And he goes, why would I do that?  They wrote a line saying, where the boobies live.  Not funny. 
[02:37:30]  And I said, let's start again.  Okay?  And then the next thing, you come back to the conversation.  Now, when the candles are lit and the room smells nice, you got the day, you know, da, da, da, da, da.  They even had some lines that said, it's not going to work.  Buy your nails.  I mean, stop.  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  Crazy.  So, then I say to him, then you put in a little Sinatra, Barry White.  He goes, who's Barry White?  Okay, that's it.  Come on.  And I take him, and I take him to a massage, Paula. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, but it's a nice thing, the girl.  But it's insane.  And it's really funny.  There's a funny scene where the staff is.  That's where the girl's getting picked on that the kid likes.  So, the bully, the kid faces the bully and kisses him on the mouth.  It's like a really weird moment where the kid kisses another boy on the mouth to stop him from picking on another girl.  I'm like, they're getting fucking ballsy on television.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But his line is, he says to the girl, he says, don't worry, he'll be afraid of me from now on. 
[02:38:30]  I think I'm going to be afraid.  Yeah.  No shit.  They're going for it.  Yeah, they really are.  But we have jokes like, I mean, there's this one show.  I mean, I saw it the other day.  It was, I mean, hysterical.  I mean, I couldn't laugh.  Everybody was laughing, so you'd miss the punchline.  But the whole premise was that I'm so angry, I'm breaking things, I'm yelling at the kids.  I'm a guy, he's flying one of them, you know, those phony helicopters around my field.  Yeah.  I go, Blackhawk down.  I'm insane. 
[02:39:00]  So, so, they go, what the hell is he so mad about?  And we kiss, well, you know, you need some of that good stuff.  Maybe he needs the good stuff.  So they flashback, and I'm watching, like, from here to eternity, we got the clip, you  know, when the wave rolls up.  Yeah.  And they're kissing.  And you say, oh, that's the good stuff.  So, now they decide, oh, we got to get them a date.  So they go online, and then they send the kids out, like, in the shopping mall, you know,  like, if they're wearing rings, forget it.  If they have a cat, something go for them, whatever, all these stupid things. 
[02:39:30]  So they fix me up with this nice girl, just starts it.  And she tells me, come on, you got to be there, you got to meet Dottie, like, you know,  and I have, I says, no, I'm blowing that off, because, like, I got to finish this  salmon jerky before it expires, you know.  And I got a silver toothpick that I used, because I save a ton of money on toothpicks.  She says, do you wash it?  I says, what am I going to give myself something?  Why do you take me for it? 
[02:40:00]  I mean, it's just really, so anyway, the upshot is, I have this dinner, and my daughter  introduced me, you know, this is Dottie Sanchez, and she, she's got a 20-year-old, lives  over there, a 21-year-old, and she has a dog, this cute little dog she calls Kevin Kline,  and da-da-da-da-da-da, and Jesus, and then the woman says, yes, you know, when he, when  he was little, a little puppy had such a cute little face, I thought I'd call him Kevin  Kline, I wouldn't say the word, and I just look at her, and goodbye, and I get it.  So I get this lush hooker, I bring her home, I mean, she's, this girl is so, she's got 
[02:40:30]  one of them, one of them coughs, you know, I mean, just brutal, this is hanging out,  be just brutal she comes to the house and she's oh you got two cups of coffee don't wake her up  you know oh yeah so like one of the lines is what's the matter with her lungs i go  nothing wrong with her lungs she held her breath like a dolphin 
[02:41:00]  but it goes like you know what i mean like  it's amazing you know yeah yeah i think you just saw the ones that go and i couldn't believe it  i improvise every once in a while like my daughter comes just got a sour face there was no there was  no line between her walking in she looked miserable sat down i go what's with the face you got a  problem with your she gina they were what they started laughing jimmy can't say that okay  you got a problem with your lady gina i think it's the gina part i went like this in the walls no 
[02:41:30]  they left that they left she gina in because oh they did yeah they thought okay that's not so bad  right good for you a lot better than you know waltz right right have you turned down network tv  before or is this something that you you avoided for a long time and now you find the script you  like you know the truth is this is unwarranted stigma you know always that listen i turned brian's  song down four times for the reasons man but you know you got to behave the way the people who uh 
[02:42:00]  are you ordering pizza by the way no i was ready to take a picture of you because you're a legend oh  if you really need to know i thought i was out with one of the you know i'm sorry if you really  need to know you're a legend i'm taking a picture kind of sex grandies girls now you know that like  when they whenever they text hey yeah yeah it's on the tip of the finger now that's where the g  spot is now smile if we're gonna do this let's do this proper so far you guys have made me laugh okay  well you're making us laugh though please so the phone's down so you turned down brian's song four 
[02:42:30]  times why why'd you turn it down no again because it was a tv movie right you know like at that time  it was like if you did television you're out of the business right so you had to behave the way the  people who are hiring you or running your life the way they thought you know but then i i'm so sick  that i literally thought after three or four times we're going to rensselia we're going to work out  there and i thought i was better than the back they had i had a guy named don shy and in my mind 
[02:43:00]  i said you know i could i could i played a little at machine but very little so i really  thought i could uh make the team i was in the middle of every scrimmage all the producers were  going crazy those guys killed baby something about it yeah after my 12 12 hits 10 hits i got  listen i'm an actor yeah exactly like you know phone you know butt kiss i mean just boom wow same with  this you know and my son started yelling at me what are you and and the truth is the pictures today 
[02:43:30]  i mean i've lost my ability to uh fight prehistoric monsters and jump from building to building what  have you you know i just yeah my birth certificate is not there's not there's not the stigma on  television i don't get the girl i accept that so you know i'm not putting on any funny costumes they  don't look that good anymore so i mean what's left are are basically you know anything that i like i did 
[02:44:00]  one very with a great director named uh guillonne canet who's married or lives with but they're  french you never know the difference yeah but marianne coutier who's just brilliant you know  and zoe zeldana clive owen billy crowder i mean a great cast so that was one but the other three or  four that i was forced to do they asked me what the name it was and i said what was the name of that  pick i called the rent every one of them were called the rent i mean just to make the line i really like  like you know the integrity that you try to hang until you know there's a point i got four wives 
[02:44:30]  and five kids i got it jesus wow when you when you did the godfather and you started like shooting  and obviously that yeah that changed your life uh how did brando treat you it's oh we got along  great oh you did oh yeah yeah before and after i just i'd say anything and he'd laugh i mean it was  it was just was that the part you initially read for or no was sunny the part you originally went  for or did you go for uh did you had you gone in for another screen test first no no that whole 
[02:45:00]  story is such bullshit it is francis when francis got i had done it with duval who's like my oldest  friend in the business you know or in the business period one of the two but uh um he when francis  has got the picture uh i was with the evans at the time and they first they were looking at gus  the gravis or garvis who didn't see a wonderful but francis was so perfect because he's a mediterranean  italian a brooklyn italian you know so if you look at the picture i think the success success of the 
[02:45:30]  picture had to do with uh you couldn't condoned everything because it was for the sake of family  you know people would say was that a real horse's head that's all i care about  80 people got their heads but it's true you know yeah yeah you know if you did it for my sister  i did it for your brother you did it so uh and that's what made it i think and he was like you  know music and art and uh anyway this first cast immediately was was bobby and uh al who you know 
[02:46:00]  we didn't know at the time uh myself and brando so the geniuses would now take all the credit said  if you mention brando's name again you're fired you can't mention him and then al you know al who's  wonderful but i don't know he was sort of shy i don't know what it was so yeah he wasn't shining on  these and we went up to to zoetrope and for about four the price of four camp corned beef sandwiches 
[02:46:30]  we did these tests on 16 millimeter you know eleanor his wife gave us a haircut with with a bullet it's  like a bad picture that's unbelievable swear to god yeah and and so then we went home see you later  it was the case now all the stuff started you know these people who think for a living or get paid  to think for a living rather they you know oh no you can't even we don't want out that so about two  three months later francis is preparing everything and he calls me one night so it had to be about 
[02:47:00]  three in the morning it's their time he goes jimmy i said what i had done the rain people with him  already and then he says uh they want you to come and test i said what you got a porsche you want me  to drive around the block he says no please don't even go there i said please just come in so i go and  now all of a sudden i'm testing for michael who wants you to play michael michael  no i mean but i knew francis francis was not one of these guys that hit and miss this guy was like 
[02:47:30]  the best you know at the time you know other things you know happen in life he's still you know  brilliant but then there was nothing better but he had you know visions he wanted michael to be the  sicilian looking one the authentic you know and sonny was the americanized version of you know so he had  even the looks that he wanted wow yeah yeah so i knew that was wrong and i just made it it was  horrible and then they tested the bobby thing and you know and and puza wrote a book the making 
[02:48:00]  the godfather this is serious radar right yes yeah yeah go ahead go for it mario in a book said if  if con had tits he'd have played k  so but i knew what francis wants at the end of the day he'd sneak he'd sneak allen again you know  do that they'd go crazy they really didn't want l wow no but here's here's the beat and every actor  you could name was sitting in this room on this huge room sitting against the floor it was disgusting 
[02:48:30]  you know you know you name them the big with stupidest accents you ever heard italian you know  irish whatever didn't matter they were all there and after this all day of time poor francis and i go  home and then at one point they had this common caridi gonna play me i was gonna play michael i was  nauseous yeah home and then uh ruddy and and the girl that was one of the runners of uh paramount at 
[02:49:00]  the time um oh gosh anyway senior moment they came they came they came into the and i said stick this  picture up your ass all right wow yeah bobby says i'm throwing them out of the 34th 30 story window i'm  gone and i jumped down on a train i was in such a hurry i'm not testing again jumped on a train and  went and did this 10-day part that they made part of the deal jimmy would you do this before  you come into the godfather so i did this picture in chicago and then that night they 
[02:49:30]  you know they called back and everything was set wow so basically my point is they spent at the time  now 450 000 which is like 40 million today yeah yeah that's a whole movie on tests and they  wind up with the same cast they had for the four they started when they started that's like a  general electric product this is our most important product you know when did you know this the movie  was going to be a masterpiece when did you realize holy crap we got something never no no no look i 
[02:50:00]  mean because you never know officially you could have a great cast and all that right i knew and which  to me is a huge ingredient you know like that we all liked each other i knew i was really good people  and we laughed you know we you know and that's i don't care i you know you can go to movies and i'm  not one guy like any other guy you know either get moved i don't get moved i have a good time  you know i don't sit there and analyze it but you can always tell  inadvertently that these people like at each other i don't care what the subject matter is you know 
[02:50:30]  huh yeah yeah it comes off the screen so we we had that i had great actors with me the head of  every department this is all francis is doing like dean tavaleros was nobody he became like you know  one of the great set there walter merch became the sound guy in the business gordy willis you know  became the so every one of these department had dick smith who's like a genius you know with special  effect makeup special effect uh-huh all these people were put together by francis you know and 
[02:51:00]  they wound up being like amazing uh in their field yeah wow that's a talent being able to just  identify that yeah you know and how old was france at the time to be able to to butt heads with a  studio 33 and he's making a massive amazing yeah yeah what was luca like as a person the guy who played  luca because you know he's he i'm hoping he wasn't really like that guy oh yeah oh yeah my my friend 
[02:51:30]  who introduced me to him was here with me today but um um he was i mean one of the great i got so  many great stories with luca oh i mean he's the big scariest son of a gun yeah yeah when he's on the  set he was like a little girl you know like really and he talked like this you know very almost he had  feminine move really you know so and this is genius a friend it's a good story and and you got a  long boring show absolutely believe me until you walked in it was three hours of mediocrity we need 
[02:52:00]  you to stay till tomorrow so so lenny comes in now he weighs about 350 about six feet he had hands like  shoe boxes i mean his fingers like he was just he was the masked marvel years ago in the wrestling  world which was like a famous wrestling and anyway you know he did work with you know with some friends  they you know whatever their business was anyway he was he was you know he was just one of the fellas  you know right so now they see this guy oh my god you know it's luca brazzi so i think one of the 
[02:52:30]  first scenes we did and he was like so scared i can't explain it to his chest i mean they don't  make clothes so he had dark this dark in the years a real black italian what they call black it looked  look like you know this indian so he's walking around and the first scene he had to come in the  door so i had a close-up the door opens brando's behind it and and he comes in luca comes in and he 
[02:53:00]  says don collio i am happy to be here on the day of your daughter's wedding  may your first child be a masculine one francisco's cut  all right um lenny a little more  a little more something okay okay boss 
[02:53:30]  i am but was that staccato thing you know right now he grabs me on the side francis  says jimmy do something me i'm not even gonna see but he knows that i know but my friend you  don't friend do something what do you want me to do loosen them up do something i don't care what you  do but do something loosen them up so i take him over i take him in the corner and we'll talk talk  and i go lenny hey come on we gotta have some fun we gotta make a slam what he's got a tongue  you know looks like you know a shoe so i said look uh when you come in right it's a close-up when you 
[02:54:00]  say don collio stick your tongue on and i put f f you on you say you can say uh you know far away no  i put you on his tongue yeah and a piece of tape but i said come let me put the jimmy don't do this  come on let me stop please don't do this be like a little kid don't make me do this i just 
[02:54:30]  let me you gotta do it we gotta have some laughs it's just for laughs  whoa this took 20 minutes please i'm not don't make me call my friend  anyway he he does it they open the door and he goes don collio  well everybody laughed brando laughed everybody laughed so then he felt pretty good okay  let's do it again right done  nothing changed but but brando was so funny when he went he answered and went luca and 
[02:55:00]  had a fuck you too i'll tell you the genius of francis this is really genius that was shot  the interior of that was shot three weeks before we did the outside the scene that preceded it you  you know the wedding and all of a sudden it was never in the script he's got luca in the corner  if you remember rehearsing yeah yeah it was perfect you know it's like to make that  i am honored to be so he did he had to add that now he put that in it was great so it was like 
[02:55:30]  now it justifies how he sounded yeah it was a rehearse in the room you know that's perfect that's a  great story that's amazing and the kids ran in and he just left it right wasn't that an accident  when the three children ran in during uh luca talking to him yeah i think i heard that the  kids just kind of ran in and he left that in i don't know we left you know we did a lot of  hilarious accidents that was hilarious because he practiced so much and then the kids screw it all  up for him on your daughter's wedding for your daughter's wedding he stopped but it was all 
[02:56:00]  perfect oh it all became perfect because you see him study of course yeah brings it together that's  right it's brilliant yeah he really was he did not give a smooth delivery he was looking down at the  paper at least one thing to say he's gonna look at the paper killer that's what he was supposed to  anyway he was a piece of work yeah yeah yeah he was in the jerk uh with steve martin he played uh  i think he played iron balls mcginty steve martin kicks him in the balls and he's got a  metal balls and steve martin hurts his foot they were they were all such iconic characters that 
[02:56:30]  everybody from the godfather you when you saw them after that you'd know you know ah that's the guy  from the godfather right yeah let me was i mean off camera i told the story last night it's one of my  favorite we were all a bunch of us you know from you know the city pals you know all my good friends  and we we decided to go with the you know one of my friends who liked it you know throw parties and 
[02:57:00]  um benny benny goodin was playing in the rainbow grill right the whole band and that's a small  place so you can imagine what the tariff was it was like stupid so lenny was notoriously one of the  the cheapest guys he never had more than twenty dollars in his pocket i saw somebody give him ten  thousand he sent nine thousand you know nine hundred and eighty dollars home to his wife right so he  only had twenty dollars so we go up we go up to the rainbow grill the six six of us five six of us 
[02:57:30]  at the table i'm just having drinks but it was a dinner show but how do you pay benny goodin's band  you know so everybody's tuxedos from park and you know paint i don't know what happened so all we had  was a couple drinks you know well this is benny goodman it was great this and that and my friend  who always grabs the bill you can't get the bill he grabs the bill he's giving the bill he grabs the  bill and he never says anything but this was so ridiculous he says to me geez he's well these are phone 
[02:58:00]  numbers he says what we buy this freaking place so and then with that lenny overheard he goes i'll take  care of it oh no and we both look like this is impossible he's not you know especially after  guys are decent though what'd you say he says i'll get my friend says just to see what would happen  he goes yeah god yeah so now let he's sitting and he had a glass full of ice and there's like seven 
[02:58:30]  eight guys behind us with three four women this huge table took the ice just chewed over the door  right in the middle of the table there we go he says hey you dirty and it took lenny about a half  hour to get up he went uh he stood up like that he had two guys like holding him off the ground like  this here come the manager you know running over said please please what are you doing and then he says  whispers you want this to happen every saturday night 
[02:59:00]  give me the bill he goes back and he says come on i don't care of it  wow what a great story  fucking horrified people in real life it's the real deal  we're being told you gotta go you got a lot of you're a busy man we could talk to you all day  busy man today i'd like to sit here yeah really the rest of the crap ain't that interesting  i'm really comfortable great man the show is uh and i saw the pilot it was very funny and the  dialogue it's very hard to believe that it's actually on network tv but again it's really good 
[02:59:30]  to hear that they're going for it i'm not surprised the cullen brothers are involved with  this i did not know they were until until james came in no but rob they're insane of people locked  up i know i know he's just mad and the staff is great you know maggie and you know my cast is just  an unbelievable band and a kid and and um the the girl that plays lulu is unbelievable so i mean  it's really nice the kids are great and i i like getting up in the morning and that's a lot of 
[03:00:00]  money yeah unlike you guys yeah yeah it's miserable the show opens with with you bashing a car window  with a baseball bat no it opens oh they do the trees from yeah yeah yeah that's how the show opens  and uh it's just a very interesting opening to a sitcom and it's called back in the game  and it premieres uh tomorrow night wednesday night 8 30 on abc or 7 30 wherever you live you know what  time 8 30 is here it's all based on new york let's be honest of course and uh it's it's it's 
[03:00:30]  fucking james conden it's great and and again the cullen brothers very fucking funny guys so i'm very  happy to involve married so he's you know he's got to be he he he is more executive like or tries to  control it and when we first got together and they they wrote it for me they said right  and all i remember mark saying now i have two of them  james conden was a pleasure last man thanks so much great time thank you i want you to come  do my radio show oh where's that not yet i'm happy all right we'll do that we'll do it for sure 
[03:01:00]  the great james conden everyone  the open air three show  continues  are we all good i believe we're uh all good warren haynes is setting up nice i consider him a 
[03:01:30]  friend now man he's done our show enough yeah the very thin warren haynes was a tremendous amount of  weight yeah you lost a bunch of weight there sir thank you looking good thanks uh nice it's it's not  fun losing weight no i'm proud of it and glad to be doing it but it's not fun what sparked it um 
[03:02:00]  you know i had been i'd been the same amount overweight for years and then one day i realized  i started to gain weight and i was like oh wow i can't do that i've been yeah i've been comfortably  overweight for a long time but when it starts gaining i said no plus i have a two-year-old son  and i got to be around to chase him around do you find yourself looking at yourself i find myself  looking at myself naked in the mirror a lot more no because i lost weight i'm like i just find myself  standing in front of the mirror nude oh yeah i don't think i've quite reached that point 
[03:02:30]  i'm hoping for that yeah what are you craving that you're not that you're not touching what's the one  thing i'm not doing any bread and um and no chocolate and i'm a big chocoholic right  but you know i'm getting used to it uh it's uh on the road it's hard to not just reach for  something in the middle of the night and you know i realized if i just as we were talking about just  cut out a bunch of the garbage you know you can actually lose weight mini bars are hard to hotel 
[03:03:00]  you go to a hotel a mini bar it's like one o'clock in the morning it's impossible i think you guys just  traveling like you do i don't know how you do it i don't know food in those things yeah it's just not  it's hard to find good food on the road impossible i don't know how you do it and it's also when you  when you get off work at midnight who doesn't eat after they get off work so it's like uh to not eat  late at night which is the rule number one you're not supposed to do that right it's like bread is 
[03:03:30]  everything though like everything you eat has fucking either a bun on it or it's some type of bread  ah makes everything delicious yeah it does damn it over here absolutely yeah i guess that's part  of what you said it's not fun but you know it's uh it's a nice lesson in discipline so yeah apparently  and you know last time i was here was with patrice too yes and uh what a you know what a tragic thing  yeah yeah it still kills it kills us to this day yeah it's still very real and very new to us oh man 
[03:04:00]  he was it's been almost two years already yeah and it feels like yesterday that he walked down  that fucking hall he was amazing for us and an amazing friend too and you guys did a little  blues number last time you did yeah that was that thing was unbelievable how great that was just off the  cuff uh howlin wolf yeah going down slow and how like how almost like uh prophetic you know it was  like uh right uh but what a funny guy man you knew greg too didn't you weren't you friends with uh 
[03:04:30]  giroldo i was and and i actually i do this uh charity show in north carolina every year during the  holiday season and he was going to come down and be part of it um and then he passed uh and i didn't  really know him uh we were just starting to kind of get to know each other and had mutual friends and  stuff but man he was he was a real talent as well yeah he was brilliant he was funny yeah very funny 
[03:05:00]  guy man yeah oh boy yeah start to think warren's bad luck yeah right comics stay away at least you're  safe jim wow low blow yes but accurate hey warren what are we promoting today we promoting shout uh shout  yeah the shout came out today or comes out today however you want to look at it is is it today  already it's today already started today's today that's your next song right a little early for you 
[03:05:30]  is it today already you know it was a little early at 4 45 yeah yeah you're on imus yeah and when i you  know my car picked me up at 4 45 and i was like yeah i'm usually not asleep by then yeah sleep yeah but  it's been it's been a good productive day i've gotten a lot accomplished whereas normally i  wouldn't even be awake right so now you get the rest of the week you just sleep in exactly you did  for about you did very well yeah there's 22 songs on this record too well it's like long warren and 
[03:06:00]  the guys it's government government mule they're doing something cool here uh the disc one is all  the songs and then disc two is all the songs done with other people yeah so you get two versions of  each song yeah it's it's an interesting concept i don't think anybody's ever i can't think of anyone  else that has done this is smart we did alternate versions of each song with uh with different  friends and and great vocalists so uh disc one is all government mule no guests and it's all me 
[03:06:30]  singing and then disc two is you know as you see there it's uh dave matthews ben harper dr john  steve winwood grace potter elvis costello miles kennedy who did some stuff with slash and glenn  and glenn hughes who i think sang with uh sabbath oh miles kennedy that's right  oh this is great yeah everybody on there is amazing and and they all did fabulous jobs and  everybody kind of uh took the song and made it their own you know whose idea was that was that 
[03:07:00]  your idea i think so uh i'll take credit for it i gotta ask you i gotta ask you a concert question  because we were just talking about this yesterday maybe you can give us some insight metallica we saw  him at the apollo it was an amazing show and i need to know if you guys after a while get sick  of playing the same songs like it like as a fan as someone in the in the venue you can't tell  whatsoever metallica were they were singing it like they were singing for the first fucking time so it's  not a problem with them but for you guys do you get kind of sick of playing the same songs over and 
[03:07:30]  over again after a while yes and and uh in a word but i'll tell you our solution to that okay we don't  play the same songs every night no because you guys are able to mix it up and change it up just enough  especially with with government mule over the course of a tour we'll play a couple of hundred songs uh  and our audience understands that that might mean that some of them are a little less rehearsed 
[03:08:00]  but they like that and we like that so uh as an example if we do three nights at the beacon  theater or something like that we won't repeat any song over three nights and we play for three hours  so that's nine hours of music with no repeats and the reason is exactly what you're saying  i think the burnout factor is much more obvious if you're doing the same stuff night after night after  night now i gotta defend metallica you wouldn't tell at all but i'm just thinking some of these songs  they've been doing for 25 close to 30 years you gotta think and they got the repertoire so if they 
[03:08:30]  get sick of something they can put it on the shelf for a while you know but they probably couldn't do  three nights without repeating like because there's certain songs our fans demand it's kind of cool your  fans let you do that and just say hey man whatever they're playing we're going to enjoy that's a great  place to be we've been lucky that we kind of carved out this uh this model of doing that uh you know and i'm  i'm sure some people come occasionally if it's their only show and they don't hear their favorite  song maybe they're a little disappointed but everybody kind of understands that that's what 
[03:09:00]  we do you know yeah right on well like play for us here's something yeah like to hear something  absolutely sure what are we what are we going to do today uh i'm going to do this song called there's  only a few songs that i can do by myself from the record so and uh so i don't want to mislead  anybody into thinking it's it's a mellow record because it's definitely not uh but this is one of  the ones that i can do by myself this is called when the world gets small and the alternate version 
[03:09:30]  on disc two was sung by steve winwood  when the world gets small  when the world gets small i feel like it's closing in  through it all is you 
[03:10:00]  when i feel like i can't go on  when i feel like i can't go on  no reason to aspire  just can't rise above there's you 
[03:10:30]  only you  voices of a thousand years  voices of a thousand years  ringing in my head  but yours is the only one  that cuts through it all  when the world gets small 
[03:11:00]  when the world gets small  traffic on the highway  even more in my head 
[03:11:30]  makes me long for another  time and place  when life was so much easier  and all my friends were still around  and there was a big smile  on my face 
[03:12:00]  yesterday i was flying high  high above the crowd  but i know i'm gonna need  a place to fall  when the world gets small 
[03:12:30]  when the world gets small  when the world gets small  and sometimes i feel like 
[03:13:00]  it's getting smaller every day  jesus wow  you gotta be kidding me  you've done that you've done that a few times  huh  i'm meaning saying  it's unbelievable 
[03:13:30]  thank you  warren haynes when the world gets small  off the government mule  uh cd called shout  tremendous  it's really  fucking good  wow  what a great sound on the guitar  holy  shit  that is a great sound  it sounds really  fucking cool  what do those pedals do  i don't play music  there's two pedals  i've seen guitar players  always step on those pedals  i don't know what they do  well the first one  is a tuner  and so when i step on it  it shuts the sound off  and lets me tune 
[03:14:00]  uh to lights that tell you  if you're on in tune or out of tune  and the second one is tremolo  and i will demonstrate  no tremolo  so that's what it does  uh sometimes you have that built into an amplifier  but in case it's not  i bring my own with me  damn you should have that for your voice  when you stand up  that would be nice  a little tremolo  every time the punchline's coming  i give it a little tremolo 
[03:14:30]  so it reverberates throughout the last one  let everyone know when it's coming  a special effects person  yeah  yeah smoke dramatically rising  as my joke is building  uh when was that written  um  about  three years ago  three years  that's actually one of the oldest songs  uh on the new record  uh  i wrote that song  it's the first song i wrote on piano  when i bought a piano  and i've never played piano before  but i just bought one  oh sure yeah  that's what i want to do  yeah  you know just buy a piano and play it  for the first time 
[03:15:00]  i just wanted to get good enough to write a song  you know  i was  opie played air piano  i did  in a band  i was in an air band  he was an air band and he played air piano  that's right  look  you're trying to own it  i'm bonding with warren hanks  that's what i'm doing right now  let me ask warren  do bands like yourselves  do you guys respect air guitar bands  but i wasn't a guitarist because they already had the guitarist  but i was recruited  warren to play the keyboard  define respect  i was 18 
[03:15:30]  give me a break please  okay no no  what were you doing at 18  probably playing a real guitar  you know what i have heard though  people say that  that people that play guitar  are terrible  at the air guitar  at the you know the guitar hero  like guitar hero and stuff  yeah yeah yeah  i've heard that if you play  it makes you worse  yeah because you know how to play a real guitar  and it's nothing like it  yeah apparently  yeah  i have heard that  so 
[03:16:00]  so why did you wait three years to put that song out  that's that's a beautiful song  you would think  if you come up with something like that  you would want it out there immediately  well uh  the last government mule record was four years ago  wow  and it's  in between then i did a solo record  and that song didn't really fit into that  okay  so i kind of saved it for this record  and uh  it was great because  i'm glad that i did because uh  it worked out that i was able to get steve winwood to sing the other version  and he just crushed it  yeah i can't wait to listen to that 
[03:16:30]  it was a great song by uh government mule forever more  oh  i love that song off that last album  yes  i think you sang that the one time you were in here  maybe so yeah  always had a good song  amazing  thank you  now all right  so solo and uh  government mule what's the difference  considering you're  one of the you know pretty much the main focus of both bands  what what goes through your mind for the for the two different projects  well government mule is more of a rock band and  the solo projects more like soul music and blues and stuff so if uh 
[03:17:00]  if i write a bunch of songs that seem to lean more in that direction then it's time to make a solo record which is not very often right right  uh it's more of a departure uh and everybody said well couldn't that solo  record just have been a government mule record and i was like yeah but  it's a little more traditional than anything we've ever done and uh  but i think your fans you know would be cool either way right yeah and it  worked out good because government mule wanted to take a hiatus and and uh  and i was able to record while we were on break which was great 
[03:17:30]  that's also you don't have to split the money with all those other guys that's  the  always thinking but the confusion continues government you'll want to take a break  but you're in government mule so that part of your brain only wanted to take a  break but the warren haynes part did it uh exactly exactly whatever part those are  how many people in government mule how many four okay and and your solo band has how many  uh six oh actually more yeah yeah yeah the solo band has saxophone and uh 
[03:18:00]  uh uh more harmony vocals there's a girl singer alicia shakur who's awesome and  and uh nigel hall that plays uh keyboards in my solo band is also a wonderful singer they're both  working on solo records of their own nice when you write a song and i've always do you get hit  with like are you in the shower or do you wake i heard because i heard phil spector woke up and wrote  uh uh to know him is to love him like because that was written on his father's tombstone and he  just woke up and he had dreamt that song i mean do you do you work like that or will you actually 
[03:18:30]  sit down and go i need to write a song actually that's more often than not i write when i'm really  tired late at night uh three o'clock in the morning or something i get an idea and if i'm awake already  i start working on it and if i'm not i make myself get up because that's when i probably do most of my  writing the analytical part of your brain goes to sleep a little bit yeah there's something about  removing the filter you know because i think we kind of block a lot of creativity just by being 
[03:19:00]  awake and you ever you ever get that feeling when you're really tired you think of something that  you would never have thought about in the turn i mean i'm sure from a comedy standpoint the same  we were just talking about this uh last week uh lorne michaels goes with that that's why he makes his  his people stay up so freaking late okay because they get a little more creative because they're  sleep deprived we were just discussing this with uh what's his name who's in here uh michael  chay michael yeah michael chay said the exact same thing your inhibitions drop a little bit right  yeah absolutely get punchy you get punchy have you written a line can you think of a line you've 
[03:19:30]  written that seemed like kind of good and poetic and the next day made you want to vomit i've written  entire songs that i thought were awesome and that's great and then look uh look the next day and go that's  horrible that sucks you ever hear some of your really old songs and go oh man i wish i could go back  change that one little word or a little riff or something yeah sometimes uh you go back and change  something but uh don't wish you can because it's already out there as is yeah well absolutely i i think 
[03:20:00]  for the most part you kind of wish you could change everything a little uh but you just kind of live  with it and move on like almost every record i've ever done there's something about it you'd want to be  different sure yeah like anything else what are you going to do right can you play another one or is  it too early for you yeah i could do another one sure yeah what do you want to put anything honestly  anything you want uh how about uh there's a song called captured uh on the new cd which is uh 
[03:20:30]  uh the the alternate version of that was done by jim james from my morning jacket  i never wanted to be swept away 
[03:21:00]  i thought i might lose myself  nobody told me there'd be music sweet music 
[03:21:30]  and i got that second feeling  and though i try to brace myself  i can feel me start to surrender  sweet surrender 
[03:22:00]  everything i needed to remember  everything i needed to forget  everything i needed to forget  when i see a smile  i am a child  i'm captured 
[03:22:30]  never thought i could love someone  never thought i could love someone  more than i love myself 
[03:23:00]  more than i love myself  nobody told me  about forgiveness  but now we're waving our flag in the air  the one we sewed together 
[03:23:30]  the one we sewed together  we're planting our seeds in the ground  we're planting our seeds in the ground  the one we sewed together  i don't learn 
[03:24:00]  onlySabemo  know  i don't feel like you need something for me  so i can see you  I'm out. I am a child. I'm captured. I'm captured. 
[03:24:30]  I'm out. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, my God.  That'd be the worst, wouldn't it, if you woke up one day and realized,  oh, did I steal that from a Hallmark?  You know, you realize you got it from a limerick or something.  You're like, I knew that that man from Nantucket line was wrong. 
[03:25:30]  I got to say, after hearing you perform the two songs off Shout,  the new government mule CD record, whatever people want to call it these days,  I've always loved your voice.  It's going to be tough to hear these songs with the other guy,  even though it's a great concept.  It's very cool because you get two interpretations,  which I think, at a minimum, you get a better understanding of the songs themselves.  Because when you hear, like, Elvis Costello sing Funny Little Tragedy  and my version of it, they're completely different. 
[03:26:00]  Toots from Toots and the Maytals singing Scared to Live is amazing.  Everybody did an amazing job.  But I just think it's cool.  Well, for me, as a songwriter, it's just great hearing other people enjoy the song.  You get to sing your stuff, right?  And you've always loved having other people work with you, obviously.  Yeah, it's something that kind of keeps me.  The one thing when I go see the Allman Brothers every year at the Beacon is,  you know, the guest every day is just coming in and you guys fool around with it.  It's awesome.  And we do that at the Beacon more than any other place. 
[03:26:30]  But that's cool.  You know, because if we're there 11 shows or 13 shows or whatever we do,  it just kind of makes it interesting every night.  I've seen you guys there, I don't know, it's got to be five or six times now.  Whatever.  Another band you've got to worry about.  I don't know what else to do with Warren A.  Just to be honest with you, I mean, that song just blew me away.  Yeah, I think the music spoke for itself right there.  It's just great, dude.  The voice is great, the guitar playing. 
[03:27:00]  I'm watching your fingers while you're doing that,  and it's just so effortless and making such a nice sound.  And I'm like, I could never do that.  If I had eight fucking hands, I couldn't do that.  You'd be clunking something, right?  But it's just amazing to watch this beautiful playing.  If I had eight hands, that could save a lot of money.  See, I'm thinking like you now.  That's true.  Play the drums, he's fired.  Play the fucking harmonica.  That would need two mouths.  I fucked it up already.  What about where are we at with tour dates with Government Mule? 
[03:27:30]  We start in Atlanta day after tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  You're ready to go.  And so we're going to be on tour for about a year off and on,  promoting the new record because it's the first one in four years.  And, you know, we're psyched to be back out on the road.  So how do you handle that with a two-year-old?  He comes out sometimes, and we try and strategically book the tour where I can go for a few days and come home and that kind of stuff.  Right.  It's nice to have him out for a few days at a time.  He actually came out for ten days one time, which was the most he's ever been out. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, wow.  But I'm torn between thinking that's, you know, for me, selfishly, I like having him out there, but I'm not sure it's the greatest place for him to be.  Right.  But I sure miss him when he's not there.  Would you like him to be a musician?  If he wants to be.  You know, he seems to have some sort of knack for it, and he's got good rhythm and coordination.  He doesn't just bang in the normal baby way. 
[03:28:30]  He bangs kind of in a rhythmic way.  But, you know, if he wants to be a baker, that's okay, too.  That's cool.  That's the way it should be, right?  All right, Warren.  Great, man.  Wow.  The great Warren Haynes.  Oh, it's the Warren Haynes on Twitter.  Oh.  That means there's another Warren Haynes somewhere.  Looks like he might not be a tweeter. 
[03:29:00]  Warren may not be twittering himself too often.  I still have a rotary phone.  He writes enough.  He doesn't need to be writing on Twitter.  And WarrenHaynes.net, allegedly.  And Mule.net.  Mule.net's a good place.  You can go to Mule.net and kind of link up to anything.  Very cool.  Well, shout us out today.  And the two songs you played were beautiful.  Absolutely.  And, again, the record's not a mellow record.  Those two songs may seem that way with me standing here by myself. 
[03:29:30]  But it's rocking.  And I think it's the best thing we've ever done.  I'm really proud of it.  Oh, one last question.  Have you ever put out an acoustic CD?  The only thing I did one year at Bonnaroo, I played a solo acoustic set and we released it.  Wow.  So it's just me live at Bonnaroo.  But I've never gone in the studio and done that, which is something I really want to do.  I'm going to search that out now.  Bonnaroo set.  Yeah.  It's just like the entire set that I played that day, Warts and All. 
[03:30:00]  Cool.  Which opens up with a Radiohead song.  Which one?  Lucky.  You know that tune, Lucky?  I'm not going to fake it.  I don't know.  It's a really cool song.  Yeah.  But I didn't do it thinking it was going to be a live record.  I just had to play it like 1230 in the afternoon.  And I was like, well, what can I do that's going to kind of freak people out?  Yeah.  So it opened with a Radiohead song and we wound up using it for a live record.  Oh, nice.  All right. 
[03:30:30]  Mornings, everyone.  I think we're done for today.  I have one plug.  Yes.  November 1st, I'm at the Beacon Theater with Dice.  And I don't know where tickets are at.  I know they were selling extremely well.  So hopefully there's tickets left for that.  But go to Ticketmaster and we have one show together.  Sure.  That's it.  And Government Mules at the Beacon the 30th and 31st of December for the New Year's shows.  And I think tickets go on sale October 4th.  Oh, wow.  New Year's Eve there.  Huh?  31st.  30th and 31st.  Great.  Cool, man.  Thank you, Warren.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:31:00]  You've probably heard about the whole ACG TVR called the Hopper.  If you haven't, you're living under a rock, aren't you?  One of the most amazing features is the auto hop.  And it gives you the power to skip all those commercials on most of your major network primetime shows.  If you don't like watching commercials during all your great shows, all you've got to do is enable it once the first time you play a show back.  Then you put down that remote and let the hopper skip all the commercials.  Then you try skipping, fast-forwarding, rewinding. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, what a pain.  With the Hopper from Dish, you can finally watch your favorite shows, totally uninterrupted, all the way through, from beginning to end.  Completely commercial-free.  If you love watching primetime network shows, but hey, sitting through those commercials, the auto hop is perfect for you.  And you can only get it with Hopper from Dish.  Watch more TV, watch fewer commercials, all with the Hopper from Dish.  Call them, 1-800-WATCH-TV.  Easy number, right?  Get Dish Network today.  Plans start at just $29.99.  That's 1-800-WATCH-TV. 
[03:32:00]  See you tomorrow.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We're just planning out this week's podcast.  The Opie and Anthony podcast is on iTunes and everywhere else, but there'll be a new one up tomorrow that should be a lot of fun. 
[03:32:30]  In the meantime, this is after Opie and Anthony live, so call up 866-WOW-1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  I've been, you know, Art Bell.  You know who Art Bell is?  He's the, uh, he's a legend in radio.  He does late night radio.  And apparently he lives out in, like, Roswell by Area 51.  And it just talks about, like, aliens and paranormal and all this stuff. 
[03:33:00]  It's not like Alex Jones conspiracy theory stuff.  It's more UFOs and paranormal and supernatural and things like that.  But that's been my, uh, go-to morning show lately.  Because it's on, I guess it's on the Indie channel, uh, late at night.  And then when I drive in at, like, 4.30 in the morning, they're replaying it.  And he opens up the phones.  And that's what made me think.  Like, I just want to open up the phones.  And listen, because he believes everyone. 
[03:33:30]  Like, somebody calls up and goes, like, today they called up and said, uh, you know, we lived in a house.  And, uh, my son said there were UFOs outside.  And I didn't see any UFOs.  But my wife told me while I was gone that, uh, that every time she would see glowing feet under the door.  And he'd go, really?  Glowing feet.  As opposed to being like, what are you talking about, you crazy person?  There's no glowing feet.  He'd be like, oh, well, this guy saw glowing feet.  Let's try to explain. 
[03:34:00]  And then he'd open up the phones.  Who else has seen?  He'd go, but he'd do it subtly.  He'd go, who out there has seen glowing feet?  And I don't know.  And then people call up if they've seen glowing feet in their house.  But I listen to it all the time.  Art Bell is good.  I used to listen to Coast to Coast on, uh, when it was on AM.  Well, now it's called Dark Matter.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, because I guess it's international.  It's more than Coast to Coast.  It's in Canada, too.  But it's amazing that he just believes whoever calls him.  You know what I mean? 
[03:34:30]  Like, who is he to judge everybody else?  You're right.  You're right.  He wants answers himself.  But he, like, you call with the craziest...  Somebody called this morning, and they go,  Hey, uh, Art, I hear you're talking about, uh, uh, aliens and UFOs and stuff like that.  I just, I just want to know, uh, do you know anything about furries?  And he goes, well, what's a furry?  And the guy goes, well, it's, you know, it's people who like to dress up in big animal outfits 
[03:35:00]  with tails and masks and stuff like that.  And Art Bell is like, well, no, I don't know.  But the genius of Art Bell, he goes, uh, sir, are you a furry?  And the guy goes, oh, well, uh, well, I might be.  And you kind of immediately realize that the only reason he was calling in was because he's a furry.  And that's all he wants to talk about.  He's looking to connect with other furries.  Yeah, that's it.  He just wants to talk about being a furry, and he's embarrassed.  He's hoping Art Bell was a furry, too. 
[03:35:30]  But, uh, Art goes, well, what do you dress up as?  And the guy goes, well, you know, sometimes I might, uh, I might go out dressed as, like, a lion.  He didn't get into the sexuality of it.  I think Art Bell was lost on it.  He just thought that the guy likes to dress up as a lion.  Uh, but it's a very, it's an interesting show to listen to at, whatever, 4.30 in the morning.  Uh, 4.17, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, Sam, I went to the zoo the other day and seen a hippopotamus. 
[03:36:00]  Hippopotamus, and who out there has seen a hippopotamus?  I guess we'll never know.  They're popping up all the time.  That's what Art Bell, and then everybody who's ever seen a hippopotamus gets to call up.  You know what, it's such an easy way to do a show, because there's no confrontation, and everything just fits.  Yeah, if you don't judge anybody, and then, uh, yeah, finding the craziest people you can possibly find,  and just treating them like, oh, like they're experts, you're right. 
[03:36:30]  It is just, it's the easiest radio you could have.  And he doesn't screen any calls.  He just goes, you know, dark matter, you're on the air.  And the guy goes, oh, I saw a hippo dressed as a lion.  And Art Bell goes, oh, that's amazing.  Uh, 734.  Hey, Samuel, how are you doing today, sir?  Good.  I know a little bit about the furry thing, because I used to go to sci-fi conventions,  and I collect a lot of artwork that's anthropomorphic artwork, as they call it.  And we used to see all the fursuit guys, and they creep me out. 
[03:37:00]  It's not like a Trekkie thing.  You know, you get, I mean, I like Star Trek, but the guys know every little bit of, you know,  trivia kind of frighten you a little bit.  Yeah, the furry thing gets weirder, though, because for the most part, even extreme hobbies  are just that, they're just hobbies.  Where it starts to get weird is where you start to introduce sexuality into it.  Because the furries are just, I mean, they just, I don't know where in their sexual development  things got weird, but it seems like they just want to put on fursuits and just rub on each 
[03:37:30]  other.  I bet, and that's exactly what they do, Sam.  And, um, I remember, um, oh, God, uh, Rogan had, uh, you know, what his podcast was talking  about now.  I haven't been to a convention, a slot back convention, a long time since I've been a truck  driver now.  Right.  I don't even have to get out to him anymore.  But he was telling me, it's getting to the point where these guys use lit, though.  They're in the furries that use litter boxes in the hotel room to drink out of bowls and  shit, man.  They're shitting in litter boxes in their rooms? 
[03:38:00]  Some of them use litter boxes, dude.  That's what, you know, Rogan was saying in one of his, uh, podcasts.  And that, I mean, I didn't even saw this shit happen.  That's getting into some weird, like, uh, scat coprophilia type of porn.  That's the, I mean, when you start having to change the way you use the restroom to kind  of match with your sexuality, it's, uh, that's, it's creepy.  He was mentioning how horrified, but obviously the, uh, you know, people who do the hotel,  clean the hotel rooms, you know, seeing these bowls, you know, drinking out of bowls and  shitting in litter boxes. 
[03:38:30]  Have you ever, have you ever at these conventions, have you ever just gone for it and been like,  let me try to have sex with one of these furries, let me see what it's all about?  No, sir.  No.  Shit, I mean, I mean, I guess I went down with these furry conventions, and I go to a bunch of  artwork and whatnot.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying I'm not, you know, people won't think I'm weird.  Yeah, but you're not trying to fuck a painting, you know what I mean?  No.  Right.  Thank you, buddy.  Eric, I could see you being a furry.  No.  You're not?  No.  Have you tried it?  Nope.  I'll bet if you tried it, you'd really enjoy it. 
[03:39:00]  No.  The closest I've come to being a furry was the chubby bunny.  You get a little, a little plump in it?  No.  You didn't like the way it felt against your penis?  I get overheated really easily.  That's, that's why you can't be a furry?  You'd be sweating too much?  Yeah, plus I don't like being hugged by people like that.  Well, I want you to do something.  Next time you and your wife are intimate together, could you at least start, do, experience foreplay  in footie pajamas?  And just see if you like it, and that'll be the first step.  I will never wear footie pajamas.  Why? 
[03:39:30]  Because I hate, I get too hot.  I can't wear that stuff.  You just gotta let the balls breathe, huh?  Shorts and a t-shirt always.  Five, and let, let, let them, let them hang out the leg, buddy.  Five, one, two.  Hey, Sammy, uh, you're not talking about Art Bell anymore?  We'll talk about Art Bell.  This is Dark Matter.  All right, cool, man.  Yeah, when I was younger, uh, we used to go on road trips, and, um, Art Bell would always  be on, like, on the overnights, and he would take any stupid topic, like, werewolves.  The dude would call and say he was a werewolf.  And at first, in fact, this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but Art Bell would make 
[03:40:00]  it interesting somehow.  You leave, and not only did he make it interesting, but he'd go, you know, there are a lot of werewolves  out there, and you never know when you're gonna encounter one.  Uh, there could be many listening right now, and you, this morning, like, like, you leave  listening to that thinking, you know, he's right, there may be some werewolves.  I swear to you, I swear, what's your name?  Oh, this is Marshall from Texas.  Okay, Marshall, I swear to you, Marshall, let me tell you, this morning.  And this is not a lie. 
[03:40:30]  Somebody called up and said, hey, do you still have that audio from hell that you played  a while back?  And he said, are you sure you want to hear it?  And the guy goes, yeah.  And Art Bell goes, okay, well, this is a real news story, and some Russian guys were drilling,  and they drilled as far as they possibly could until they're nine miles deep.  And then their drill went crazy, and all they could do was get a microphone down, and they  came back with this audio.  And it was, like, audio of, like, demons screaming and stuff, and they were, he was like, I don't 
[03:41:00]  know what it is, but it could be hell.  And you're listening, and you're going, yeah, it could be.  You know, it was a 14-year-old Russian hacker or some shit that probably steals American credit  card numbers.  That's it.  But, yeah, dude, he does this thing where he's like, oh, I don't know if I believe  you, and then he allows himself to gradually be won over.  Until he's convincing you of the damn thing is real.  Yeah.  He knows.  He knows.  Thanks, buddy.  He's not about confrontation.  Because he knows when you argue a point, somebody's got to win. 
[03:41:30]  If he'll just let himself be won over, you could talk about the same thing for hours.  He had Michio Kanku on his show for, like, two hours.  Dude's exhausting.  It's easy to do a show when, you know, you have no confrontation.  None.  I mean.  Just everything seems credible.  Go with it.  It's all credible.  Like, why fact check?  This is audio from hell.  It is?  Oh, okay, it is.  From hell.  Where Satan lives.  Everybody, this is audio from hell.  It'll be up on the website.  817. 
[03:42:00]  No, 817, you're on the air.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Oh, dude, I didn't know you were talking to me.  Sorry, buddy.  That's okay.  Oh, yeah, I just wanted to call and say, I just discovered you guys about a month ago.  And I just want to say, man, you guys are awesome.  And I love the fact that you guys are just straight shooter.  And, Sam, the fact that you're a wrestling fan, too, it's really cool.  And I was just wondering if you're pretty geeked up about the new WWE game coming out next month.  I am. 
[03:42:30]  I love WWE games.  And I will be sitting there nonstop playing that game.  But what I want to know from you, I know you're a wrestling fan.  I know a little bit about you.  Do you ever have any experiences as a furry?  No.  No, you've never had.  You've never had.  I do have a hairy chest, but I'm not a furry.  Okay, so just a bear.  Yeah.  Whatever, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, I'm very pumped about that WWE game coming out.  303, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, if you have any interest in Art Bell, you need to find some audio of Phil Hendry doing Art Bell. 
[03:43:00]  Well, that is...  See, there's very few.  As we approach Jocktober, which is next week, Jocktober starts next week.  And that's where, on the Open Anthony show, we celebrate the entire month by just unmercifully mocking other people's radio shows.  And I go out of my way to find the worst radio across the country and mock it.  There's very few people who I don't feel are mockable, especially in my position, because I'm bitter about everybody. 
[03:43:30]  But I don't have anything to mock Art Bell for, or Phil Hendry, for that matter.  Those are the few...  There's a handful of talented people left, and Art Bell, for whatever he's doing.  Although I wish somebody had told him that furries were a sexual thing.  He thought it was just a hobby.  They rub butts in fur suits.  Something from Star Trek, like shrivels.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Don in Alaska.  Hey, Sammy.  I've met Art Bell down at one of those paranormal conventions down in Florida a couple years back.  And I had to ask him, because I've listened to Coast to Coast, you know, and everything.  And I had to ask him, I said, do you believe, like, these fucking weirdo callers that call in with their stupid shit?  The look on his face that he gave me was basically, go fuck yourself.  He doesn't believe none of that shit.  Oh, really?  Like, get out of here. 
[03:44:30]  He doesn't believe none of it.  Yeah, he's collecting a paycheck, just like you are, you know, for just listening to crazy people that are off their meds.  Yeah, yeah.  He's sitting there with...  I got four hours to fill at midnight.  You think I believe any of these idiots?  Exactly.  I mean, he just sits in his fucking living room with a bunch of radio equipment and takes phone calls all night.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Nate in Pennsylvania.  Or Nat.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  What's up, Sam?  What's up?  Chilling. 
[03:45:00]  Hey, where do you stand on ghosts?  I don't believe ghosts exist until anybody tells me they do.  And the minute anybody has any type of ghost story, I go, ah!  Holy shit!  I've got a ghost story.  Oh, no.  Okay, go ahead.  All right.  We used to live in a house that was definitely haunted.  As a matter of fact, there was one of those mediums, those people that supposedly know shit about paranormal. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, sure, that movie The Conjuring was all about that.  It was the people who found the Amityville Horror House and go, yeah, they get to communicate with the dead.  Yeah, well, guess what?  What?  My brother, who was in LA, he was talking to one of these crazy people, but apparently she wasn't crazy because she asked him if she could wear his wedding ring.  He had never met this woman before, ever.  So she puts on his wedding ring, she starts to tell him all about our grandmother, like, things she could never possibly know. 
[03:46:00]  It wasn't some Long Island medium bullshit where she's just kind of throwing out some loose facts and you fill in the rest for her?  Absolutely not.  It freaked my brother the fuck out.  And here's the other thing.  Yeah.  She started telling us about the ghost that we had and the house that we lived in when we were kids.  And his name was Matt.  He died of polio when he was seven years old.  Little kid ghosts are the worst. 
[03:46:30]  Little kid ghosts.  And we knew there was a ghost in the house because shit used to disappear and then just reappear.  Like, you put something down, you go to get it, it was gone, you come back later and it's right where you left it.  You sure you weren't just forgetful?  Nope.  Nope.  All right.  So there's my ghost story, Sam.  Oh, that's creepy.  I gotta tell you, do you like Warren Haynes today?  Yeah.  All right, well you have won an autographed Government Mule Shout CD. 
[03:47:00]  How do you like that?  Wow.  That thing sounds pretty groovy.  All right, buddy, I'm gonna put you on hold and the guy's gonna take your address.  How many of those do we have?  One.  Oh, that was it?  And Nat won it.  Wow, good for you.  Why, did you want one?  No, I didn't know we were giving away stuff.  Yeah, I'm giving one to Nat.  But yeah, you watch that movie Insidious.  I'm telling you, when a little kid ghost jumps out from under the table, it's fucking scary.  Little kid ghosts are way worse than any other type of ghost.  Justin in California.  Justin, you got more about furries? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, Sammy Roberts, professional broadcaster.  How's it going, buddy?  Good.  How you doing, man?  Good.  Uh, yeah, we, I work in Irvine, and it's not just a hobby, because these furries have  a convention every year at the Irvine Marriott, right across the street from my work.  Uh, and we always take time off to go and get a cup of coffee and watch them check in.  There's nothing like seeing a bear and a bunny rabbit standing in front of the, uh, in front  of the check-in, uh, to get a room.  When they're checking into the hotel, do they have, like, a luggage rack on wheels with 
[03:48:00]  a, with an animal suit on it, or are they checking in, already outfitted?  No, they're checking in, outfitted.  Um, and as a matter of fact, one time there was a guy that walked in, no costume, but he  brought in his dog on a leash, and the dog was walking on all fours.  Well, that sounds like he was just walking his dog.  Well, yeah, but the dog was a person in a costume.  Oh, shit! 
[03:48:30]  I guess I missed that part.  That's, that's like some weird dominatrix thing.  It's unbelievable.  He even put on a little cup of water and had the dog, I mean, there's no mouth in it, but  he had the dog drinking from a little bowl of water inside the Marriott Hotel.  Have you, uh, did you get to see any of the, like, the, the creepiest thing about the furry  thing to me is that you ask about, like, what about the sexuality of it, and all of it is  sexual? Like, making somebody dress up as a dog, and then watching him lick water out 
[03:49:00]  of a bowl while you have him on a leash? How is, how is, I feel like furries are an inch  away from fucking animals.  Oh, it's, and it's a total dominatrix thing, I think. I mean, they love it.  It's like a, it's like a dominatrix who's into bestiality.  Exactly.  It's horrible.  It's hilarious.  It should be, it should be outlawed.  It's very strange. And, and, and, and there's also, there's a weird, all right, so you have 
[03:49:30]  elements of dominatrixism in there, right? You got bestiality, and there's this weird  sort of, uh, youth thing going on, like, uh, retarded childhood. Not like a retarded kid,  but retarded meaning it's, growth has been stunted. Uh, in the sense that, like, they're  dressing up in these cartoonish outfits, like Disney World or something, so that, now they're  infusing elements of, like, childhood cartoons into their sex. 
[03:50:00]  And I can't imagine what those hotel rooms look like when they're done with them.  Oh, and they probably leave their outfits behind, and there's just jizz-stained football  mascot uniforms. It's disgusting. It's disgusting.  Oh.  Oh, thank you, Justin.  Yeah, one last thing before I go.  Yeah.  Slavo!  Good for you, buddy. Good for you. He did squeeze in a good one. That was a good call,  was it not, Eric?  Sure.  It was. You gotta give him credit.  Who am I to say it's not a good call?  You gotta get, exactly. Well, and, uh, it was a good call, and you never know when you're 
[03:50:30]  gonna run into another person that's shouting Slavo.  Three hours and 30 minutes left.  Yeah, yeah, and he's just sitting there. I love when he teases, before break, we're gonna  go to open calls when we return. Open calls. And it's like, okay.  But yeah, I mean, I, that's what, SiriusXM needs to do some kind of furry show. Those  things are so weird and fascinating to me. I would listen to people talk about furries  like, all day, because I don't understand the culture at all. 
[03:51:00]  Weren't you supposed to go to a convention?  Well, I'm not going to. Yeah, I was gonna go. A couple years ago, they wanted me to  go to a furry convention. But the problem was that, and this is why it's so creepy and  weird, they don't allow any recording. Like, they said no video, no audio recording, no  nothing. And so that's why it's a mystery as to what happens. And that's why I never ended  up going to a furry convention, because I wasn't going to be able to record anything.  And if I can't bring back any data, what's the point? 
[03:51:30]  Jay in Pittsburgh. Hang on, let me hit the button. Jay.  Hey, Sammy, what's going on?  How's it going?  Not too much. I was, a couple years ago, I went with a girl. We went to a hotel for a  weekend, and we went downstairs to the bar, and the bar overlooked, like, this banquet  type facility. And there was a runway show of furries and people messed up in anime characters. 
[03:52:00]  Like a fashion runway thing?  It was a fashion runway where the anime was the lead, and they had their furry pet on a  leash.  What the fuck goes on?  And I would just look at it. And the girl, I wish she was very proper and didn't like  anything like that. I was just laughing my ass off.  Yeah, I mean, I don't care how proper you are, and it's like, oh, I don't want, like,  you have to be able to watch something like that and be amused. At least, or at least be 
[03:52:30]  fascinated. Like, at least watch it from the point of, let me get a cultural education  right now, because this is beyond me.  Yeah, and we had a couple drinks on us, and we watched this for a little while.  And she just, let's go to our room. So we're walking, trying to get to the elevator, and  there was just a gaggle of these furries and anime people. So we took the stairs, and we  got to the third floor, and she's like, screw it, let's take the elevator. So we went up  on the third floor, got the elevator, and there was an elevator full of these anime masters 
[03:53:00]  and furry pets. And the smell was unbelievable. I mean, it was disgusting.  Did it, did it, tell me this, tell me this, Jay, did it smell crusty?  It was nasty body. It was disgusting. And I was, I'm in the military. I was in the Middle  East, and I smelled a lot of disgusting, stinky people, and it just brought me back  to being in Iraq. I'm like, this is sweaty, disgusting fucking people. 
[03:53:30]  You've seen some horrible things. This is the worst.  That took, that took the cake. And I'm in the elevator, and we have to go up to like  the 10th floor, and there's people getting off at every floor. Doors are opening, and  regular people, I guess, would just look in the elevator. There's all these characters,  and then there's me and my girl.  And you're like, I swear, we're not, these are not our friends. We're just trying to get  to a room.  And yeah, and my date was disgusting. She said something, this was one of them. And they just 
[03:54:00]  started on her, like, she's not accepting. She doesn't, she doesn't get them.  You know what? It's one thing to be accepting, but human beings need to be accepting to a  point, alright? We're in 2013, and we're just getting to the point where the general population  is okay with people being gay. Do you really, like, how much do you expect of human beings  that we now have to put up with anime, people dressed up as Japanese cartoon characters, walking 
[03:54:30]  around with grown people in dog, pound-puppy costumes with leashes?  Yeah, and the confrontation escalated to where these furries wouldn't break character. They  were panting and yelling, angrily barking.  So, like, you're in a confrontation, and you're being like, would you, like, somebody's literally  barking at you? How seriously can you possibly take anybody who's like, okay, seriously, you're 
[03:55:00]  offending me now? And you know how I show you that? By meowing.  Listen, I was trying not to laugh, and my date, she was a little intoxicated, and she's just  antagonizing them. And finally, I kind of stopped in, and I'm like, hey, let's just all relax.  And I touched, like, one of the animals, the furries on their chest, to, like, just relax.  Hey, bro, calm down.  He barked at me and tried to bite my hand. 
[03:55:30]  Like a dog would. Like a live dog would.  Like a dog would, so I figure, you know, let's enjoy this, and I slapped him on the nose,  and I said, bad dog. He broke character. He broke character, and he told me to go fuck myself.  Look, you did the exact right thing, because if you're in an elevator, and a dog tries  to bite your hand because you pet him, or you put your hand on him, you're going to slap  that dog across his snout.  Yeah, bad dog.  You know what you should have done? From now on, next time you're near a furry convention, 
[03:56:00]  bring everything you need, because I would have euthanized that fake dog right in the elevator.  Oh, I wish I had Mace.  Put him to sleep. Put him to sleep.  Next time I do that, I'm wearing a Michael Vick jersey.  Yeah, in that case, I would have fully supported Michael Vick if it turned out that his dog  fightings were actually just furries. Just furries fighting to the death.  Weird. That was my... It's one of those things that's like, afterwards, it's like,  what the hell did I just experience? This is not normal life. 
[03:56:30]  But that's what makes life worth living. Hey, Jay, do you like The Walking Dead, that show?  I love The Walking Dead. Me and my daughter. My daughter's seven, and she's never missed an episode.  Okay, well, uh, you see, for season two, they put out a deluxe DVD set that looks like the  governor's cooler full of zombie heads?  Uh-huh.  All right, I'm gonna send you one. Is that okay?  Ah, thanks, man.  You got it. I'm gonna put you on hold, and you just want a deluxe Walking Dead Blu-ray.  What? We're giving that out, too?  All right, hold on. 
[03:57:00]  Eric.  You've got a lot to give out.  I'm feeling like Santa. I'm giving out the... I'm feeling love, so I want to give it back.  Uh, let me go to...  What else do you have?  Scrambler.  Hey, Shani.  What's up, buddy?  Uh, we have a gigantic, in Chicago here, a gigantic costume shop, and it's open all the  time, but for, like, a month around Halloween, it's open 24 hours a day.  Wow.  So you can imagine, like, the characters that you get in this place.  Yeah.  And we went in there one day just to kind of look around, because it's so busy, and 
[03:57:30]  I was curious. I asked the woman, I said, what do you do when people come in and ask, because  they rent costumes? I said, what do you do when people come in to rent animal costumes?  I said, do you just, you know, do you kind of have to size them up? And she said, they know  when all the conventions are in town, and there's, like, the costume shops, people, it's like,  the equivalent of, like, a message board. If they have people come in that they are, like, 
[03:58:00]  they know that they're just going to destroy costumes and bring them back just completely  just awful from these furry things.  Oh, that's funny.  It's like when people write bad checks, and they say, like, don't take a check from Cindy  Jones.  See, in my head, in my head, I would think when the furry convention is in town, it means  they're going to stock up on animal costumes. I guess I didn't even remember the fact that  they really don't want the costumes back after people have had sex and used litter boxes in  them. 
[03:58:30]  Right, right.  Disgusting.  When these things are going to happen, because they have to deny people costume rentals, because  they'll come back, just like a rental car.  No, I bought...  It's a furry costume, whatever.  Look, I bought the $5 insurance on the chicken outfit. I should be covered. I should be covered.  Yeah, no, yes, that is a burn mark on it, but don't worry about it. I'm covered.  All right. Thanks, Scrambler. I would give you something, but I've ran out of prizes. 
[03:59:00]  And real quick, let me go to Vinny in Queens. What's up, buddy?  What's up, going on, Sam?  How you doing?  Uh, I got a little couple things. I got scalies for you, and I got bronies.  Okay, I know bronies. Bronies, like, are... I think My Little Pony, the new one that's  on television, like, now, has got this whole following of, like, adult, or, like, you know,  semi-adult men...  Yeah.  ...who dress up like My Little Ponies and stuff. Is that right?  Yeah, and it's not even that. They're called clopping, but it's like they have sex in the 
[03:59:30]  brony costumes.  Oh, Jesus Christ. I don't even...  Unfortunately, I don't even really have time to get into that, because that's a whole show  in and of itself. What's a scary?  A scaly? Well, it's not scary. It's a scaly. It's basically, like, scaled with, like, fucking  dragons.  What the fuck goes on? How do people even get these ideas?  I don't know. It's just like, because my friend, I talk to him online, whatever. But  he's like, oh my god, scaly, man. What the fuck?  And it's clopping when they dress up as My Little Ponies and have sex with each other?  Yeah, it's called clopping. 
[04:00:00]  Oh my god. Thank you, Vinny. That is really weird. We'll talk about this more some other  time. But what I meant to tell you about was Unblackened. Have you heard about this?  It's the new live performance DVD from Zach Wiles' Black Label Society. Ron Bennington,  have you heard about this? It gives fans the chance to see the band like never before.  Sounds fantastic. Yeah, they recorded it earlier this year in high definition at Club  Nokia in Los Angeles. Unblackened showcases the band's songs in a more intimate setting 
[04:00:30]  without losing any of their power and intensity that fans have come to expect from Black Label  Society.  Oh, good. Because I was worried when I heard it was more intimate. I didn't know whether,  you know, I'm like, well, what's going to happen to the power and intensity?  No, no, no. It's still there. It's still there.  Okay. Good.  Yeah. Legendary guitarist Zach Wiles performs on both guitar and piano, demonstrating the  subtler side of 17 Black Label Society classics, including Stillborn, In This River, and of 
[04:01:00]  course, Losing Your Mind.  I didn't get a chance to hear everything. Are they doing Stillborn in this?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stillborn will be there.  All right.  That's good.  Wild, he's proven time.  It's a sad song.  Yeah, well, especially on piano.  Yeah.  Time and time again, Zach Wilde has proven that his songwriting, guitar prowess, and onstage  persona, along with his larger-than-life personality, have made him a force to be reckoned with.  In addition to the concert, wait till you hear this, Unblackened is rich in bonus material. 
[04:01:30]  A new interview with Zach, a photo gallery, a music video for Losing Your Mind, and a feature  with Zach Wilde visiting H.M. Prison Stockin' in the United Kingdom are all included.  Ron, Unblackened is available now on Blu-ray, DVD, 2CD, and digitally.  So that's something for you to look forward to.  I'm going to, because Unblackened was the nickname from my neighborhood.  Is that right?  Now, I understand that you're giving out prizes?  I was. 
[04:02:00]  Did you want a prize?  No, no, no, no, no.  I just, I think it's great to buy calls.  I think that's a fun...  I'm not buying calls.  I didn't tell them I had prizes.  Uh-huh.  And then I picked up the call, and there were a couple I liked, so...  Yeah.  There you go.  Government Mule for you, buddy.  Signed by Warren Hayes.  That's really nice.  You guys give out prizes all the time.  Not for calls.  Just Twitter?  I don't know how we give them out.  I want to be totally honest with you.  You don't get your hands dirty on that stuff.  Yeah, I don't know how that works.  The Government Mule is fantastic, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Unblackened is... 
[04:02:30]  Unblackened is...  No, that's not Government Mule.  That's, uh...  That's Black Label Society you're thinking of.  Oh, yeah.  That's Stillborn Song.  Jesus.  What's going on around Fez today?  Well, uh...  It's going to be a big one today.  Lizzie Kaplan is stopping by.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody's got, like, a little thing for her.  Of course.  Well, she was in...  Everything she's done has kind of had a...  Like, a cult thing.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She was in Freaks and Geeks.  She was in, uh... 
[04:03:00]  Party Down, which is fantastic.  Party Down.  Mean Girls.  Mean Girls.  And then I...  She did something bad with Vampires or something once.  Right.  True Blood.  Now she's in, uh...  Masters of Sex is the name of the show, right?  Very exciting and titillating.  It is titillating because you get to see both ass and breasts.  Yeah.  And on YouTube.  Did you...  But never wear any vagina.  None?  I don't think so.  I think that puts them in a whole nother thing when they show vagina.  The first episode's already on YouTube.  I saw it last night. 
[04:03:30]  And there's titty on the YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  That's amazing.  Well, that's because you got the adult...  You know, you got the adult thing.  I did just turn 30.  Uh, but, you know, you hurt Fez pretty bad the other day.  And it's still bugging him.  It is.  I was about to ask, is Fez okay with me or no?  No.  Well...  No.  Well, he...  I mean, what did I do that hurt him?  You didn't try to be funny.  You weren't teasing him.  You just made just straight statements of logic.  Well, he can't be upset that I didn't try to be funny. 
[04:04:00]  You looked at him.  And you said, I want you to say one funny thing on tomorrow's show.  Right.  And then he came into that show.  Yeah.  And you asked him, what's your one funny thing?  And what did he say?  I don't got anything.  Yeah, well...  I don't got anything.  Well, then we don't operate in the level of funny.  We operate on truths.  Okay.  You know?  So now you're the king of truth.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's something I'm developing.  Like in this crossover.  Yeah, me too.  When are you getting Zach Wilde on the show?  I don't know if Zach Wilde's coming on the show. 
[04:04:30]  Then I must be thinking of Buck Wilde.  Is that still happening?  I don't know.  What was Buck Wilde and his partner called?  Buck...  Who's...  Huh?  Buck Wilde was...  Wasn't Buck Wilde like a...  Oh, Star of Buck Wilde.  I thought you meant the MTV show where the kid ended up dying.  I'm not familiar with that.  Yeah.  They did...  They tried to do like a Jersey Shore except with rednecks.  Oh.  And Buck Wilde died?  Well, after the first season got filmed, they found one he had passed out in his truck  or something with the exhaust front in there.  Yeah.  Buck Wilde went truck wild. 
[04:05:00]  The truck was stuck in mud and he asphyxiated himself.  Yeah.  He like...  How could he die being stuck in the mud?  How deep was the mud?  I don't know.  But he kept revving it to try to get out and then just...  Smart idea.  Yeah.  He wound up dying.  That's the brilliant idea.  Right.  You know, fill that thing with exhaust.  Well, he had big tires, so...  Yeah, but at a certain point, you would throw up and say, oh my God, there's exhaust in here.  Not if you're Buck Wilde.  Yeah.  That's the problem with losing the sense of smell.  Speaking of which, how's your hearing after the other night's show?  It's okay now. 
[04:05:30]  Sunday morning and a little bit yesterday was rough.  That is a loud show, man.  I want you to know something, because you don't know this at 30.  You've done permanent damage to your hearing, and it won't start to happen until you're 40.  You think one show will do that?  My hearing is fucked up from two shows.  One was Metallica years ago, and another one, believe it or not, was a fucking bar band  that was so loud that I got that ringing like you had for like 24 hours.  And then my hearing, you know, like a few years later, my hearing started to fall off. 
[04:06:00]  So the ringing goes away, and then like 10 years later, it just starts to deteriorate?  Well, you don't know if you've already done damage to it.  Just like when people end up getting knee and hip surgery because they played football  when they were in their 20s or something, it's the same thing.  You fucked yourself up.  Yeah, but at least I got to see Metallica at the Apollo.  Was it too intimate for you?  I mean, it didn't...  Was it still powerful because it was that intimate?  Yeah, it was still... 
[04:06:30]  The Wild tape away?  It was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know I don't like intimacy.  No.  No, it's too much.  I need power.  You weren't disappointed that they didn't play anything?  No.  I was okay with their set list.  I mean...  Okay.  I don't think...  Did they play Stillborn?  I didn't hear them.  No.  Okay.  I wanted a Stillborn cover.  I would have liked that, but no, I mean...  Is Stillborn a true...  Is that like based on a true story?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'd be really sad if it was.  Maybe you should unmask Zach Wild one day and just get to the bottom.  You don't think so.  You don't think so. 
[04:07:00]  Would you be talking about him if you didn't have the read?  Today or in general?  In general.  I could see myself talking about him at some point.  Giant fan.  The biggest, I would say.  Okay.  Among the biggest.  I am probably 10th biggest.  Okay, cool.  So we got that going.  Listen, Lizzie Kaplan is not running Fez today, so I'm going to let you start your show.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  You tell Fez, I hope he feels better, and I have confidence that he's going to knock  it out of the park today.  He's going to say something funny in honor of you. 
[04:07:30]  Tomorrow, your big show, your Wednesday show.  Why'd you have to bring up Wednesday?  That's the badass show that I love the most.  We could have just ended on a nice note.  It is nice.  I love where your energy is at on Wednesdays.  I think we've talked about this before, but I won't be here tomorrow.  It's Wednesday.  However, Ron and Fez will be here next.  So State, you've always liked my segues.  Yeah, they're really cheap and professional, and heck.  Thank you very much.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
