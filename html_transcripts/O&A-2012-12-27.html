<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a segment heavily mocking Chip Chipperson's disastrous Comic-Con 2012 interviews.  Chip, wearing a series of ridiculous hats, peppered his interviews with inappropriate comments about cosplayers' appearances, including their height, costumes, and even a comment about a man's penis size, resulting in an angry departure from one interviewee.  He frequently used the phrases "Comical Con" and "I forgot to pack my trunk," much to the hosts' amusement.  The segment also featured references to Chip’s childhood habit of throwing "doo-doo on a stick" at people.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Johnny Rotten.

The interview with Johnny Rotten (heavily implied in a previous segment as “a musician”) covered a vast array of subjects, including his early career, his aversion to late nights, his struggles with record companies, high tax rates, his disdain for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (calling the induction process a "hideous fiasco"),  his musical influences, his negative opinions of Green Day (calling them "rubbish"), his experiences with Richard Gere (whom he found funny), his views on the press, drug use, and the importance of readily available information, even on controversial topics. He also discussed his childhood illnesses (including meningitis), his long marriage and family life, past legal troubles, and his personal and artistic evolution.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Chevy Chase's alleged bad behavior on the set of *Community*, based on leaked voicemails.  Joel McHale and Gillian Jacobs from *Community* were guests, adding their perspectives. The conversation veered into discussions of *Community* itself and the movie *Karate Dog*.  Opie then unexpectedly announced he and his wife were expecting another child, a daughter.  The announcement was followed by a highly offensive and crude discussion about their future daughter, including vulgar name suggestions and inappropriate jokes about her future and potential boyfriends.  They brainstormed baby names, many referencing Long Island locations. Opie expressed anxieties about raising two children and balancing work.  This segment also included a graphic anecdote about Opie discovering condoms in his sister's dresser, leading to derogatory name-calling with his brother.

Later, Nicholas Cage appeared in studio.  The conversation with Cage focused on his eclectic musical tastes, a six-hour opera he attended, his views on being parodied on *Saturday Night Live*, his new movie *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*, his love of motorcycles, environmental concerns, cloning, and the viral phenomenon surrounding a Civil War photograph resembling him.  A montage then showed various UFC fighters (Jon Jones, Rashad Evans, and Urijah Faber) playfully assaulting Jim Norton.

A subsequent segment featured UFC fighter Jon Jones performing chokeholds on Opie, Anthony, and producer Jimmy, resulting in audible discomfort and a neck crack.  Jones also punched Opie's arm, causing bruising. The force used was discussed.  This was followed by an appearance from Ice-T, promoting his film "The Art of Rap,"  during which Opie hilariously mistook him for Ice Cube.  Bill Burr was also a guest, dismissing rumors linking him to Sandra Bullock and sharing an anecdote about airport security and his aversion to body scanners.  A Lucille Ball segment followed, including unsubstantiated claims about her personal life and commentary on her career, interspersed with audio clips.

The "Worst of 2012" segment began with a vulgar recounting of alleged sexual exploits of Desi Arnaz on the set of *I Love Lucy*.  This transitioned into Bill Burr's commentary on the President's salary, leading to a discussion about environmental concerns, particularly water scarcity.  The conversation included critical, humorous comments on various political figures (Schwarzenegger, Reagan, Bush).  The segment concluded with a somber reflection on the death of Steve Carlisi, a long-time producer.  The hosts shared memories, played a comedic animated video about Carlisi and his band, Foundry, and recounted attending his wake and funeral, sharing their interactions with his wife and family.  The segment blended crude humor, political commentary, and genuine grief.

It's your lucky guess  You got a couple of friends  Yeah  Let's get back to Chip at Comical Con  Day 2  Again I think Chip is incorrect  It's Comic Con  Oh  What?  Chip keeps saying Comical Con  But it's not  It's Comical Con  It's comic books 
[00:25:00]  It's not comical  It's not comedy  I thought it was comical  No it's comic  Chip interviews  Toad  From Mario  Yeah  Oh no  It's a little mushroom headed guy  Oh yeah  The guy walked around with a mushroom hat on  A giant mushroom hat on  Not a small one either  And no one laughs at these people?  No this is their home  It's so weird  Yeah they don't get laughed at at all  In fact if you laugh at them  You're the fucking asshole  You're the minority right  Yeah  Yeah  But can we interview you for Chip at TV?  It's for YouTube  Uh sure 
[00:25:30]  We're just talking to people at Comic Con  What's your hat supposed to be?  Uh it's supposed to be the mushroom hat for Toad  The mushroom  Uh oh  Like magic mushrooms  Like you're gonna get zooted or something  Yeah we're magic brownies right  Is that for a character of some sort?  Yes  What's the name of the character  And what does he do?  Uh Toad  What's that that?  Toad  What does Toad do?  Uh Toad is the servant for Princess Peach  At the Magic Castle  Is that a comic book or is that a film?  It was neither  It was a video game  Yeah 
[00:26:00]  That's a pretty wild hat though  Thank you  Like you're on mushrooms or something  I got so fucked up one time  I was smoking reefers  And doing Mary Janes and what not  And my friend's like  You wanna do mushrooms?  I'm like  Fuck that shit  No it's just  At that point  You're just like  No  Maybe later  Yeah  I get too zooted  I just get fucking crazy  You know  Fucking  Throw shit at the cops  And what not  I don't give a fuck  Oh yeah  Yeah  Makes sense  Yeah  That's a cool outfit though man 
[00:26:30]  Thanks man  Alright man  I'll hold the handshake  Chip has this new thing  There's a visual so you guys can see it  You'll see it on the video once it goes up  Yeah I can't wait  Where when there's the awkward pause on the interview  Chip goes  Thanks a lot  And he ends by going like this  Like the shug  Like the cool guy handshake  He leans in to go in for like  Yeah for the cool guy like high five handshake thing  Yeah it's terrible  And they just look at him  You didn't ask any questions  Is anyone on to you ever?  No once in a while 
[00:27:00]  Someone will recognize which one I'm wearing hats  I gotta get a wig or something  Or I gotta have a better look  But they all think you're just a guy with a YouTube channel  An idiot  And they're not sure how popular you are in that community  So they just go with it  I think it's so weird  Like it's too weird to assume it's a joke  Because there's no payoff to it  No there's not really a payoff  And no one comes to them later and says  Hey by the way you were on this show  And it's not like  Like Chip generally looks more stupid than they do  Yeah yeah yeah 
[00:27:30]  It's not like they're made to look like a fool  Boy this thing really is stupid  Well we got Chip at Comical Con  Interviewing a woman with a very small hat  What was the hat?

[00:28:30]  He kidnapped Santa Claus  What happened?  God damn it  I know  What happened though?  Well eventually Santa Claus escaped  And everything was okay  So  Why would he kidnap Santa Claus?  Because he wanted to get all the attention  That he wasn't getting at Halloween  He wanted to get all the attention  That Santa Claus was getting at Christmas  That's such a little hat though  You're about to cry  I feel like I should tickle you

[00:34:30]  It's made out of paper mache  Paper mache?  Paper mache  Looks like a giant toilet or something  Oh yeah  Well I mean you could use it in a zombie apocalypse kind of situation  Yeah if you had to drop a deuce or something  Yeah you know it'd be great for it's kind of sturdy light  You know carrying it around  You could just poop it and throw it on people  It'd be great  So what's your character's name?

[00:35:00]  Yeah  Exactly that  Did I cut your hat?  Yes  Did you make that yourself or did you buy that?  Uh no I made it myself  Those are really cool gloves  It's like when you go to the doctor and they put that on  You know you're in trouble  Put it up there  You know  Uh huh  And sometimes you pretend it hurts more than it does  Just to get a  But it doesn't really  You know  I like you  Where's your boyfriend?

[00:36:00]  Well the hats are fucking so stupid  And his dumb hats  And the trunk of course  I wanna see your trunk  Yeah you gotta see the trunk  And he does this thing  For a couple of them  He wore this green frog hat  Yeah  And there's a tongue sticking over the eye  And the whole interview  He's blinking  Because the tongue keeps getting in his eye  And he's totally distracted  There's also another thing  Where now he'll ask a question  And if they go on too long with their response  He'll just be dazed 
[00:36:30]  And obviously confused  And not paying attention  And respond  He can't listen to it  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about  No way  Yeah  So there'll be more on the video  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about  Yeah I mean there was  There's over an hour of  Jesus  Chip wandering the floor of Comic Con footage  Oh yeah  Yeah  It gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Coming up 
[00:37:00]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  Continues right now  Yeah now  Now  Worst of 2012  Opie and Anthony show  My name is Erock  In this segment here  Johnny Rotten  Of  Let's see  Can you guess it  Yes  Sex Pistols fame  Also Public Image Limited  If you're familiar with them as well  But that's what he's here promoting  Johnny Rotten's in studio  This guy is a  A legend  An icon  In the world  Of punk rock 
[00:37:30]  I'll say  Crosses into rock and roll as well  And he's in studio  We're having a great time  Now we heard  That he could be quite difficult  That a lot of his interviews  Don't go that well  Because he's sort of a jerk  Couldn't be further from the truth  He was great  We had a good time  Johnny Rotten  Worst of 2012  Opie and Anthony  Here it is  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  How you doing?  Wow  Peace  Take a seat  How are you?  My friend 
[00:38:00]  How are you?  What's going on?  Nice  So how are you doing today?  Good?  It lives  He shouldn't do it  This time of the morning  But  No you're right  Want to hang here?  Come here  You're not a morning guy are you?  I wouldn't be  I am  Rock and roller  No I like to be up early  Not many rock and rollers  Are up early  I've got to be honest  Fuck that lousy lot  Well you've been getting up  Doing more on the radio  For years right?  You get used to it?  Yeah I get up early anyway  I don't like too much 
[00:38:30]  The late nights  I work too hard for that  You're still working though  Hard right?  You're still out there  The kind of people  You meet late at night  You really wish you hadn't  A lesson learned  Learned very young  Yeah  But I mean  You're still fucking rocking  You haven't slowed down  No I view myself  As 56 years young  Yeah  I've got another 50 plus  50 plus?  Yeah no when I hit 100  100 
[00:39:00]  But you've been in it  For a long time too  That's what I expect  Rheumatism  You've been in it for a while  So you started really young  Obviously  You're as young as you feel in life  Yeah  You mustn't allow yourself  To like fall into that easy gap  And adults tend to talk to you badly  When you're a child  And tell you to act your age  Never ever ever listen to that  Of course not  That's why we do this  It is true  There are certain lifestyles  That afford you the ability  To stay in a state of  Arrested development  I kind of like that 
[00:39:30]  No that's not quite what I meant  No  What if is it?  Really?  The child is always curious  And always wants to learn  And that's the condition  You keep yourself in  But I like not having  Much responsibility  Not giving up  No no no  I love responsibility  Really?  Yes  How?  No  As a kid I love my toys  And I wouldn't let anyone  Break them  Alright well  Responsible like that  It is in adulthood  But do you like like  Doing the drudgery  Of paying bills  And things like that  Or are they always  Late noses  Coming in  Yeah well 
[00:40:00]  The drudgery for me  Extends to an accountant  Who pays them for me  Alright  See that's what I mean  Being able to afford  The lifestyle  No no no  You have to do it that way  Because if you don't  The tax will fleece you  Something wicked  You know the whole system  Is corrupted  Yes  You know  The more you earn  The less you get  But now  Are you taxed in the UK  Or are you taxed here?  Both  Holy fuck  That's too much  Yes it is  God damn  Yeah  Yes it is  I'm feeling that  Holy shit 
[00:40:30]  That can't be good  Double dipping  I'm mostly American now  Because I mean  It got so bad in England  78%  Means you can't function  That's insanity  78% of your fucking money  Holy shit  Yeah to pay for that pile  That's what we're fighting  We're fighting to make sure  We don't get to 78%  In this country  Yeah we're trying  We're fighting  What did they go to England  At one point  Like the Stones wanted to leave  What did they get to like  85 or 90%  No everybody wanted them to leave  Jesus 
[00:41:00]  How do you function  If they take 78%  No I mean the Stones  They lead that Mick Jagger  And that's that  Montserrat kind of lifestyle  You know  Montseurs are rats  How do you function  If they take 78%  I can't wrap my head around that  That's crazy  Oh it can get higher  Man  There was  Years ago  A famous story  It was Benny Hill  A comedian  His tax thing  Went up into 120%  That's impossible  Yeah  Which means he owed more  Than he earned  He's paid  Jeez 
[00:41:30]  Well it's famous  When he died  He died on a mattress  Stuffed with cash  Yeah  The only two  Three things he had  A mattress full of cash  A couch  And a TV full of porno  Oh really  Yeah  That's a good line  Yeah yeah yeah  He loved big tits  Yeah big titted girl  Chasing him around  Loved it  Fantastic  So now  What are you doing these days  Obviously you got the band  Still playing  Yeah  What about an album  Yep 
[00:42:00]  Called This Is Pill  It's on our own label  It took me two decades  To fight the record companies  And finally be able to  Break free from them  Wow  They have you tied up  They have you tied up  In every single which way  And you have to learn  The patience of a saint  To get out of that  Right  Well you know  Hello  Yeah  Well you know what's good though  What do you think about  The atmosphere today  With being able to  Put out your own  It's funny you've got  Kramer on  Oh yeah  Just leave a fucking TV  Blaring away 
[00:42:30]  I can see how much money  I'm losing  He's a bit nutty that  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Would you really follow  His investments  No  He's got wacky sound effects  What are you going to  He's like a morning  Shock jock radio show  Trying to tell you  What stocks to buy  I'm not on to it  Anyway  We're somewhere important  Yeah yeah yeah  You kind of  You know what though  It's kind of a good time  To get out of that  Record company thing  I think so too  Yeah  In many ways  I'm really happy 
[00:43:00]  To watch the corporate  Record business collapse  But there were some  Good things there  Yeah  You know  When you really needed  The backing  It was there  And it took away  A lot of the daily  The rigors  You couldn't do it  Yourself years ago  The office pressure  I mean  The pressure we're under  This is John  Who's my manager  How you doing man  It's unbelievable  Yeah  It's a  We're up at the  Cracker dorm  Working all day long  And then I have to go  And trot the boards  In the evening  But it's alright  You know  It's a fiddle  I'm up for it  It's the lifestyle 
[00:43:30]  I've asked for  And you still enjoy  Doing it  Very much so  Very much  That's  You know  The chance to insult  The entire world  Do you ever find it  Like you're trying  To top yourself  No  In doing things like that  No no no  That's why I quit  The pistols  Yeah  Really  Yeah  That would have been  The case  Yeah  You know  There was  Every member of the band  I wanted to top  At one point  Or another  Yeah  What's the difference  Between when you were  In the pistols  And then in this band 
[00:44:00]  With the creative  What was the difference  Like do you find it  Better now  The pistols  The pistols was great  Because that's where  I learned to write songs  Up until joining that band  I'd never considered singing  And there were many reasons  Because I went to Catholic school  And if you co-opted into the choir  It meant the priests had direct access to you  And we know about the priests  It was just  Oh boy  So let's say my singing style  Is you know  A little different  Pretty improvisational 
[00:44:30]  But I learned quick  And I loved it  And I got into like more serious topics  And in a personal politics kind of way  And that's what public image is now  When you  It's from the heart  When you're so influential  And obviously you are  And were back then too  So influential  In a brand new genre of music  Where do you get your influences from  To start something so different and new  At that time 
[00:45:00]  Oh it's a healthy childhood  And like I was saying earlier  I'm just interested in everything all the time  And I want to learn  My record collection is extensive  If anybody makes a record at all  I'm interested  Really?  Okay  I know the pressures  They go through to put that together  So I'm deeply fascinated  With the end result  And I totally adore the effort  That it takes to get that far  So for me music  Is it's  It's the thrill of my life  You guys are very  Very fuck the establishment  And does it bother you 
[00:45:30]  When you see a lot of bands today  Attempting  Benjamin Fouquet  Does it bother you  When you see them  Trying to take that message  But you know  That they don't really believe it  Yeah  Well you know  You start  And then a load of bands  Try to hop on  On your kind of like  Your drive  Or the doors you're opening  And then you get  What they call a punk movement  Which really isn't  It should have been called  Plonk  You know  And it ends up  You know  With nonsenses like  When I say Green Day 
[00:46:00]  Right right  They're not a punk band  Which are really  Leather jackets on coat hangers  Of course  They're a mainstream rock band  And they keep throwing them  In that punk habit  It's stupid  But I don't mean to be spiteful  To the laddies  Because I kind of feel  Sorry for them  They're like  You know  They're like little  Garden gnomes  You know  You  You  You  You  You  You  You know  They're not even  Has-beens  They're want-a-beens  Yeah  Yeah  But they're hugely popular  They've been successful  Yes 
[00:46:30]  And good luck to them  On that level  But you know  I know I can sleep  Well at night  Yeah  I know that nothing  That I'm up to  Is stolen or taken  Or copied from anybody  Or anything  I don't need to  Believe me  My life is full-on interesting  I'm more than happy to share this  I don't doubt it  Were you surprised  Years ago  That your music took off  Especially  I mean  You were in the middle of disco  And arena rock  Kind of stuff  Yeah  And it was so different 
[00:47:00]  All these things  By the way  I like  Yeah  Yeah  You know  I do  I have no problems  All these different genres  Of music  And I quite happily  Will hop and skip  Through all the categories  Really  So like for me  Music  It really doesn't deserve  Labels  It's music  You know  Just enjoy it as it is  But  Surprised about  Well it wasn't instant success  It was more like infamy  Yeah  True  True  Yeah  If you don't mind the pun  Infamy  They've all got it infamy  I found that 
[00:47:30]  I was well spoken  And outspoken  Both at the same time  And the subject matters  I choose  I mean I'm direct  And I'm explicit  I don't mess about  With the words  You know  I go straight to  To the point  Right  Yeah  And for me  My mind  I come from  The working class  Of Britain  And we view ourselves  As disenfranchised  And we're rather angry  About that  And  And that's  That's the drive  And the creative energy  In me  And let me explain  In Britain 
[00:48:00]  We view ourselves  As like  Well we have to  Because of the way  The society is structured  There's those that have  And there's all of us  Mixed races  Down there  That have not  The melting pot  Yeah yeah  And  We don't separate ourselves  Quite the same way  You do in America  I mean you love  Categories here  Don't you  We certainly do  Yes  Yes we do  Girls that will fuck  And girls that won't  What  What were you  So what were you  Angry about  What was the  Big like 
[00:48:30]  I'm pissed off  Well the opportunities  Were never there  The schooling was always  Piss poor  And you were always told  You had no  Opportunity  And to not bother  The system  Just go along  And toe the line  And that's impossible  For someone like me  I mean like  You know  I had serious  Childhood illnesses  When I was young  I lost my memory  For four years  Really  So you know  For someone that  Loved to read at four  That was a very  Five seven  You were in the hospital  For a year right  Weren't you in the hospital  What was the  What happened 
[00:49:00]  Meningitis  Oh shit  Wow  I know  There's a lot of that  Going around at the moment  Yeah  What does meningitis do to you  I mean I know it  But I don't know what it does  It's fluid on the brain  And it just shuts down  Certain systems  Bonk  Coma  Three months of that  At seven  A year in the hospital  And I couldn't remember  My own parents  And so  You know  This is this constant  Knowledge search  For me that's what I mean  When I say  Remain a child  I'm still like that 
[00:49:30]  Sponge absorbing energy  I never want to lose that  There's something to be said  But that's why I don't  Like sleep too much  Yeah yeah  You're going to miss something  God damn  There's something to be said  No  The fear of not waking up  Oh is that it  Yeah  Even when you were  Even when you were younger  Because you can remember  Not being able to move  You know  Fuck  Are you afraid of  Dying  Remember them prodding you  And not being able to move  And that's  Whoa  That never ever leaves  Ever  That's like a torture  Does death scare you  No  Death would have been  An easy resolve 
[00:50:00]  If it was that  That condition of immobility  That was the real challenge  You remember when they were  Prodding you  Because you're aware  That you know  At any age  That someone could pull  The plug on you  Sure  You know  Jeez  Holy crap  So are you a bad sleeper  They called the gaffer tape  Yeah  Are you a bad sleeper  As a result  Like it's hard for you  To get to sleep  Yeah  Very serious sleep  Yeah  Me too  Not quite insomnia  It's a little heavier than that  That's why I kind of  I sleep with  Half my brain still 
[00:50:30]  You know  Going  Don't let the bastards  Get you  Oh man  I have to go to sleep  With something on  Like a TV  I can't be left alone  With my own thoughts  I'll never go to sleep  I don't like to listen  Well I shan't be sleeping  With you  For me  One of the biggest  Thrills  You know  Because we travel  A real long time  On the tour bus  From one gig  To another  Because I hate planes  Oh yeah  Is just looking  Out the window  America  I find this  This is a country  The most amazing  Place on earth 
[00:51:00]  Yeah coming from  A small nation  Yeah  The diversity  Of one state  To another  And I mean  For me  That songwriting  Material  Right there  Right  Yeah yeah  You're inspired  By what you see  Out the fucking  Bus window  Absolutely  Anything human beings  Get up to  Fascinates me  Is there any place  You don't like working  Like any place  You don't like doing gigs  Strip clubs  Oh really  Well I'm always  First on the bill  And I'm a bad 
[00:51:30]  Bunny with a pole  Are you more  Optimistic or pessimistic  About people  When you're  Writing songs  Optimistic  Optimistic  I'm surprised  By that a bit  I'm pessimistic about myself  I mean I'll write  Self debilitating songs  You know  And I'll criticise myself  And oddly enough  When people hear  Those kind of things  They think it's about  Them  They don't realise  That's self analysis  Oh it's about you  Because I listen to the songs  And you come off  As more cynical  And pessimistic  About humanity  No  That's me questioning myself 
[00:52:00]  Oh okay  To try and overcome  Those demons  Of self doubt  But you do have  General optimism  In humanity  Oh yeah  I've got to  And I  I mean what's the choice  You know  Reality  Yeah  Oh okay  At least you're calling reality  I've seen reality TV  That don't work  That's not reality  That's what leads me  To believe  Like we're doomed  As a species  Oh that's so easy  That's too many  Lou Reed albums  Is it?  All right  You're right  Okay  You're right 
[00:52:30]  You're right  Oh god damn  Well I find that surprising though  But it's about yourself  You're always trying  You're very self critical  I think so  I think you better  Clean up your own act  Before you start  Pointing fingers  At other people  That's just the way  It is with me  Yeah  When you write  Like if you want to write  Do you say  I want to write  About something  And then sit down  Going to do it  Or will you wake up  And just go  I have to write  About this  Because I'm thinking  It just occurs  Quite naturally  You don't force yourself  Into any  Working position  Or you don't adopt  A favourite chair  Because that's  That's not writing anymore 
[00:53:00]  That's repetition  That's finding comfort  In a  You know  In boring routines  And you'll never  Ever resolve  Any  Any situation  Or problem  In humanity  Through a routine  That's not good  For creativity  You know  We are not ants  Yeah  Yeah  I'll leave that  To the Japanese  I want to ask you  About the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  What do you think  Of the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  You guys were inducted  Hideous fiasco  Of course  Hideous fiasco  And you didn't 
[00:53:30]  And you didn't show up  I didn't only not show up  I sent them  An extremely  Pointed letter  Oh right  I was actually there  When they read that  I went to see  Black Sabbath  Well you see  This is a  It's an institution  That cloaks itself  In secrecy  When they hold  Their ballads  You don't know  Who's voting for what  So being nominated  Is not really  An award at all  Sure  You know  It's some kind of  Skullduggery or smugglery  Yeah  But I mean  You know  I've had nothing  But problems 
[00:54:00]  With pistols and pills  For 20 years  From record companies  How on earth  Am I going to accept  An award from that lot  Right  After they're just  Fucking you  My award would be  A decent record contract  Right  You know  And shove the rest of that  Right up where it hurts  We're back to pole dancing  Do you think  They put you  And so I sent this letter  You know  And I thought  They'd get the point  Well in a weird way  They did  Because it's now  One of the main features  Of the museum  In Clears  Oh shit  Good for you  It almost backfired 
[00:54:30]  Wait a minute  Like urine in wine  Was one of the points  Do you think  That they put you guys in  Just because they had to  Like a lot of times  They don't acknowledge things  When they're happening  And then in hindsight  They had to  It was in an incorrect order  Too  There was some nonsense  With the clash  Going before us  Oh  You'd like the clash  Yeah but come on  They came a long time  After me  No they did  Yeah  They were hanging on  To the shit stains  In my old shirt  You can't take the Irish 
[00:55:00]  Out of me  But he recently  They discovered toilet paper  It don't work  No no no  So do bands like Green Day  Know that you kind of  Like even though they  Much look up to you  That you kind of  Look down at them  And go like  You're not the real thing  They expect me to  Acknowledge them  And I do  But not in the way  That they would find  A program  They would like  No  No  I ran into them  A few years ago  It was  Some mad thing 
[00:55:30]  At the  What was that place  The Museum of Modern Art  Here  Oh  MoMA  Yeah  There was some  Yeah they were doing  Some thing about  British clothing  And of course  You know  I feature highly  In such activities  And Green Day  Were some of the guests  There  So I just ran across  The hall  And told them  What I thought  Oh shit  And what did you say to them  You have to be honest  Yeah but what did you say to them  It's not a personal attack  It's like  Look you're fucking rubbish  You know  Wow 
[00:56:00]  Nice  Good for you  That must have been crushing  I'll tell you one of the great things  Of that now  Oh sod them  I've forgotten  Was running into Richard Gere  Who I found to be  Hilarious fun  Wow  You know  And I was thinking  Hamsters  Oh shit  First thought we all have  The first thing  I always think of  Was it gerbil  I think it was a gerbil  Might have been a gerbil  String tied around  The little thing's legs  He's a really good bloke  Really  He's really really funny  I hear he likes going up to tables 
[00:56:30]  And trying to get girls and women  Yeah but I mean  No seriously  As an actor  He does good work  That man  Yeah  And he's outside of the Hollywood system  Or shitstum  As we know it  Yes  And so  You know  I applaud that  So he's going to get that kind of bad press  Uh huh  Just because he walks his own pattern  His own route  His own road  Yeah  And that's you know  Made a road rise with you  For anybody that stands up  And faces this world  As an individual  Gets my applause  And always be wary  Of the put down bad press 
[00:57:00]  Unless he gets  The more  The more that they spread these kind of rumours  It means the more that what you're doing  Really matters  But you don't give a shit about the press  Well of course I do  They can have all the shit I've got to offer  There is a certain freedom in them  Like knowing what you're all about  And you kind of putting it out there  Because there's no secrets  There's no stress of having to hide something  It would be a shame  If the media  Well it is a shame  Because they tend not to write the truth too often 
[00:57:30]  And it doesn't seem to be much of a legal representation  For individuals out there  Well they could put allegedly  That's why  You have to run the gauntlet  And yes I understand  Well you ask for it  Right  You big loud mouth  Famous etc  Yeah  Six of one half a dozen of the other  I think I can cope with it  But I know a few people out there  That haven't over the years  And they tend to go into the self pity  And go church mousy  And then the drug habits start creeping in  And the alcohol 
[00:58:00]  Right right  It's very difficult to try and like  Because I've disciplined myself really well  I understand that drugs are  A wonderful source of entertainment  And not a problem at all  And it's the same with alcohol  Because you know  I know the limitations  And I know that it's all about social for me  And I don't lock myself away  But many artists are very, very, very temperamental  Yeah  And touchy 
[00:58:30]  Did you get yourself in trouble?  I wish that they would socialise more  And kick that weakness out of themselves  When you were younger  Did you get yourself in trouble  With fame and success?  Oh what do you think?  Well I assume yes  But I do assume yes  Oh I was like ping pong with the jail system  Yeah  And then I became unpopular  Which actually  That's when all the trouble stopped  Really?  Yeah  Because I found something to do  Songwriting  Yeah  Interesting 
[00:59:00]  Because  I just  I would assume  That it was more  The lifestyle  And getting popular as a musician  Oh no  That would get you in trouble  Oh no, no, no  I was a bad bunny from a very early age  Oh okay  So even before  Yeah  You said something  God, I'd hit the aspirin at 12  Jeez  It started early  You said something in a drug  A drug  That was  Yeah, I assumed  The aspirin  Nom de plume  Nom de plume  Of drugs, yes  I saw drugs 
[00:59:30]  What has to be discreet  Of course  I wouldn't have it any other way  You did a panel on legalising drugs  Which I saw  Which was really interesting  Yeah  And you talked about  How you think  That the problem  Is that information  Is withheld  Yeah  Yeah  If  I think if young kids  Knew the  The real content  And the results  Of some of the things  They're shoving into themselves  Like bath salts  Right, yeah  You know  This is  You really need to know  What you're doing here  You cause less problems  I'm all for transparency 
[01:00:00]  Of information  On everything  I wanted pregnancies  The lot  Because  You're just causing problems  By denying knowledge  To young people  I mean  We're back at that  Again  This is my constant  Right, right  You know  So  I mean  Even in a song  Like One Drop  I say  We're the ageless  We're teenagers  This is how I feel in life  Yeah  And so  Here I am  I'm declaring  I think all information  Should be readily available  People confuse that  With condoning things  I don't know religion  And it is religion  That's getting in here  And somehow 
[01:00:30]  Casting aspersions on us  Of what we should  And shouldn't be knowing  It's like limiting  The English language  And reducing certain words  Out of it  Because they've got  A naughty saucy context  Right, right  Yeah  You know  People do confuse that  I'm an Anglo-Saxon  Cow  I say what I like  And bollocks  People do confuse  Giving people knowledge  With condoning stuff  Yes  So that's why  They try to keep it  Which is quite the opposite  It's stupid  You see  There goes a moralistic value  That's got to be stopped 
[01:01:00]  Because I don't need  Somebody else's morals  To decide  What's right or wrong for me  I need the information  And I'm more than capable  And then you'll make  The decision  Of making the right decision  Of course  Somehow I don't think  People are getting confused  With the fact that you might  That's a bit logical  Listen to somebody else  It's too logical  I think we're past the point  Of thinking you might  Listen to somebody  I've done my listening  Yeah  No shit, man  Stand in line  What do you think  It was about you guys  Two or you in particular  That the people just  Oh, yeah  I know you  Jim Brewer 
[01:01:30]  Jim Brewer  You were on Saturday night  Yeah, I know, sir  Goat boy  That's fantastic  Hilarious  He was just asking goat boy  For some more coffee  He did turn to goat boy  And asked for a cup of coffee  And then realized  It was Jim Brewer  Roland, you suck  How are you, man?  Oh, it lives  John needs some more coffee, please 
[01:02:00]  Yes, I do  Yes  Are you a big coffee drinker?  Get that energy a little up?  Not really  But I mean, it's early in the morning, isn't it?  You've got to have something  You know, put a rev in your bum  You've got to do something  Are you doing a lot of live shows?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Currently on tour  Where are you playing?  All over?  We just played last night  In Williamsburg  It was just  How'd it go?  Wonderful little fair  Yeah  Brilliant atmosphere, that place  What are the crowds like  Now  Adorable 
[01:02:30]  Adorable  Yes  Do you get fans from  No, it's a pill zone  People come for the right attitude  Yeah  All the dogs are outside in the street  In here  In our house, we call it  It's a house of love  Yeah  Yes  And sharing  And generosity of mind and spirit  It's a proper rave  Yeah  With a Paddy Shindig thrown in  With a Turkish folk band  At a Greek wedding  Sounds fantastic 
[01:03:00]  And pizza on the menu  And you're performing  Let me plug a couple of your dates  All these places  You're going to see the country  Yeah, yeah  And Canada too  And you don't fly  Nah  Yeah, those bus rides  I know you love America  I love them  I love them  You've got such a brilliant country  Yeah  You should see all of it  Every chance you get  Yeah  Yeah  Except maybe around Chicago  Because it's a little on the  Industrial side 
[01:03:30]  True, true  Well, you might as well see it though  It's one of the most surprising things  When you leave Chicago  Late at night  After a gig  And you see the beautiful colours  In the sky  In the dark  And you realise  That's all industrial waste  Being pumped into the air  Put a little  It's death  A little starlight through it  It looks great  It's death  It's really well lit  Well lit death  America does it so well  Did you see yourself 
[01:04:00]  Still touring  At your age now  When you were growing up  And just started getting into it  I don't know  When you're 16 and 17  As you can see  Very much farther  Beyond, you know  The end of your nose  True, yeah  That's, you know  That's one of the joys  And problems  Of being a teenager  Isn't it?  Yeah, yeah  You know  You grow out  Of being just selfish  Because you have to  Share the world  With other people  Yeah  Did you see  And I can't wait  To share myself  With all of you  I 
[01:04:30]  Was it  Fucking  John is a blast  John rules  God damn  Hey, is it  Fucking rule, man  Is it harder  Is it harder  Come here goat boy  I've got a pair of  Webingtons  Go boy  He just calls him  Go boy  Jeez, Boomer's done all  It's great  It's great  Fucking love it  It's so funny  Is it harder  As you go on  To kind of remain  True to who you are  Like as you get older  And more successful  No, no, no 
[01:05:00]  Because your friends  And your family  Particularly my wife  I mean, they keep you  You know  Well level headed  How long have you been married  John?  Nora, you know  It's like  It's the frying pan  On the back of the skull  If I get too bad  You know  Enough of your shenanigans  The old cartoon  Al Kabong  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  It was  The horse with the mask  Yes  And I know the banjo  Al Kabong  Yeah  Well, that's it  If I'm in at 4am  Because I'm in to the early nights 
[01:05:30]  But you do that  You know, because you are  You're sharing your life  With other people  And you've got to do that  And of course  I've got grandkids  And things like that  It's family connections  You've got grandkids  Wow  How long have you been married?  Oh, nearly 30 years  Wow, yeah  I know, I'm John  I don't make commitments lightly  That's it, huh?  Good for you  30 years  I'm like super glue  You can't get rid of me  No, apparently not  And you like the fact 
[01:06:00]  That you're married to somebody  That kind of just  That doesn't  Yeah, because we're so different  Right  See, totally different people  And view everything differently  And so everything is sort of  A semi-argument  But it isn't really  It's like a debate  Which is healthy  It is  Because, I mean  She'll watch all those  Like E! Entertainment  Horrible things  Oh, no  But she'll feed me  The lines I need to know  You've got the filtered version  I've got to go through all of it 
[01:06:30]  Yeah  And that's rather good  The filtered version, yeah  Yes, absolutely  What kind of music does she listen to?  Anything with Ryan Seacrest on  Is a problem for me  What kind of music  Does she listen to?  Well, that eliminates  Three quarters of TV, doesn't it?  Exactly  He's on everything  His radio stuff is really good, though  I think he's terrific  Oh, he stinks  The New Year's Eve thing  He does a delightful job  With that  There's everything you need  To know about America  He stinks  Yeah  But we all fucking gobble it up 
[01:07:00]  What kind of music  Does your wife listen to?  Oh, my God  She's into the Rihannas and things, you see  That's so weird  Soft R&B stuff  Yeah, well  Which is kind of odd for me  Because, you know  I've listened to a lot of the backbeats  And the samples  I'm going, uh-huh  That sounds like an old public image  Oh, right, okay  You know, you know  You know it's true  Oh, yeah, yeah  You're hearing shit  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  All the way through rap  Through all of it  Does it bother you  Or do you like that you've been influential? 
[01:07:30]  No, look  It's a good thing  It means, you know  That music sounds better  You know, it sounds more like  How I like it to be  But unfortunately  There's no royalties or money in it  Right  Yeah  That's the missing bit  Did you feel with the Pistols  That the image was transcending  What you wanted to do musically?  Like that was taking the front  Center stage?  No  No?  No, never  No  Like kind of a freak show almost  No, no  It became kind of sad  Because of, you know  Certain members  Like getting involved with 
[01:08:00]  With silliness in drug  Right  And stuff  And so that  That became an emotional  Problem  Yeah, yeah  But never overtaking the band  I mean, it reached a point there  I just  I just said to an audience  In San Francisco  Ever get the feeling  You've been cheated?  Because I felt cheated out of it  And that was it  Goodbye  Wow, really?  I think I've seen that video  That's on video, right?  Yeah  You can actually see that  That's just the end of the show  I thought that was the best use  Of the film or ever  Wow, man 
[01:08:30]  Really, that was it  Yeah  Hey, did you  You know  So I eliminated that  Jefferson aeroplane  Somebody has to do that  Around here  You don't have any sacred cows  In the music business  Oh  How is it, Dale?  Scout  It's a fucking fat joke  She is a fatty  Holy fuck 
[01:09:00]  It's pretty quick  It's pretty quick  I love it  I feel like I love it, man  Were you a Beatles guy  Or did you not  No, no  My mom and dad love to Beatles  And it used to drive me crazy  You know, sometimes  Your parents can turn you off  Things accidentally  But, you know  Other things  Like they loved  But I turned them on, too  I mean, I got my mom  Really interested in Alice Cooper  Really?  Yeah  And you were into Alice Cooper, apparently  Yeah, well, you know 
[01:09:30]  Just for the laugh of it  Right, right  I don't mind watching blokes  Dangling on piano wires  Yeah, yeah  Well, that's somebody  Whose stage show and persona  Overtook any music that  Yeah, but in a hilarious  Innocent kind of  Like, happy way  And it fit with the time  No, I would always love Alice  And he's a great  Great bloke to me  And, you know  Just really easy  He's very into golf, I hear  That's the sadness  That made me go like  Really?  That visual of Bing Crosby  And Alice Cooper  Yes  Putting little balls about 
[01:10:00]  With strange sticks  Isn't that just an odd thing?  When I found out he golfed  I was a little taken aback myself  Well, that explains  The Ryder Cup situation  We lost the Ryder Cup  Yeah, yeah  I saw  Did you lose it?  Oh, my gosh  I saw Peers tweeting about that  Got her ass kicked  Who won it, then?  Who won the Ryder Cup?  I don't know  I have no idea  Oh, yeah  I saw Peers  We had a big  America, aren't you bad news? 
[01:10:30]  We had a big lead  And you kicked our ass  Wait, is the Ryder Cup golf?  Yeah  Oh, boy  America versus, like, the world, basically  Yeah  Well, it ain't NASCAR  Yeah  Yeah  Do you  Are you into social media at all?  Twitter?  No, no  No, no, no  I know, you know, obviously somebody around me uses it  Uh-huh  But I ain't gonna spend the rest of my life, like, attached to a silly phone telling someone  I've just woke up, I fancy a cup of coffee  Oh, dear  Exactly  The toilet seat fell, I've got a bruise 
[01:11:00]  But we need  It's so self-important, and at the same time, unimportant completely  It definitely fits your persona, um, not getting involved in it  Yeah, no, you don't need to do that  But he would have a lot to say  He would be a good one to follow  You'd be a very entertaining guy to follow  If you just spoke your mind on it, it'd be fun  Yeah, man  Because you wouldn't be talking about that shit  And I know people, they get addicted to it  So they end up having no life at all  Talking about the life that they're planning  Just live 
[01:11:30]  That's brilliant  Yes  Just live your life  We were talking about how people go to concerts  And they hold their phones up, and they're taping stuff  And it's like, it's right in front of you  Drives me mental  Watch it, you dummy  Drives me mental  Yeah  The old-fashioned version used to be going on holiday  And spending all day in a hotel room writing postcards  Of wish you were here  Right, right  Well, you know, where?  Writing postcards  Yeah, but exactly that  It's so annoying  Holding up them bleeding cell phones 
[01:12:00]  Snapping pictures or whatever  People are missing the real experience  They're too busy recording what they're doing  And not doing what they're doing  Well, that's so you can watch it later  Yeah, exactly  You've got to watch it later  Word, word  Living vicariously  Vicariously  Isn't that a nasty word?  You never want to live vicariously  No, you do not  You want to live victoriously  Yes  Goddamn  He's right  That's amazing  We're learning  We're learning  What is it about you guys you think that the public gravitated to? 
[01:12:30]  Because the whole fucking  Young people just loved you guys  It must have been the underwear if you ask me  Do you think it was the message or the fact that you were saying fuck you  And they couldn't say fuck you  No, it wasn't as trivial as that  It's the voice of hope  You know  I mean, I've never been offering death and sadness and murder and mayhem to the world  For me, revolution is a passive thing  It's, I believe in, philosophically, Gandhi 
[01:13:00]  Passive resistance  You can make your system collapse just by not contributing to it  That's the most correct way  And I think, philosophically, in the history of mankind  That that Gandhi message has been the absolute almost importantist  Do you think that people  Because I don't believe in the bibble  The bibble  The dribble of the bibble  Do you think a lot of people misunderstood that, though?  Because I think a lot of people had more of the impression  That you were for violence 
[01:13:30]  Well, that's utter nonsense, isn't it?  Because there's no evidence to back that  Right, right  I think people had that impression, though, for some reason  You know, am I violent because of police harassment?  Well, damn right  But that's a different agenda  Do you feel you were targeted?  You know, not all of us go to prison willingly  Do you feel you were targeted because of who you were?  Yes, yes  Like I said earlier  If you stand up and you're loud and proud  About what it is you're offering the world  You're putting your head in a weird way  In a chopping block 
[01:14:00]  You expect to take those knocks  But enough of the important stuff gets through  That there is that hard core of people  That understand what it is you're saying  And they'll take that message  And expand that into their universes  And slowly but surely good influence all round  You could call that zen, if you like  Sure, sure  It sounds a lot more reasonable  Than I think people had the impression of you years ago  I haven't shot you dead yet  I've had every opportunity 
[01:14:30]  Come on now  He is quite reasonable  I am  Johnny Romantico here  Is there anything that you looked at in the establishment  That you hated when you were younger  That like this time has gone on  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  The fact that I had no place in it  I hated that  And then I grew up realising I really didn't want to  Yeah  And you know  And I don't mind contributing to society as a whole  I don't mind paying my tax 
[01:15:00]  And I believe in looking out for people  That are less fortunate than me  I have no problems with that  But I won't take dictates and mandates  And rules and regulations  That I think stifle my personal freedoms  So I'm a curious blend of  Well, I don't know  What was the American politics?  Sort of libertarian  With a touch of  No, I can't stand that bunch  Really?  They're so freaky weird  They do come off as weirdos 
[01:15:30]  They are for less government up your ass  Yeah, I'm totally for less government  Yeah  But I'm totally for caring for those less fortunate  Right  So I'm a cross between the two  Yeah  No, I'm not sitting on a fence  Not with his fast  No  Very painful  I think a lot of people  Again  I think most people think like I do  Yes  And I don't like the extremism of far left, far right  But that's the categories that we were talking about earlier  That Americans seem to love  And who's telling us that that's it?  Well, why should I accept that?  Yeah, yeah  Sodom all  You've seen that political debate the other week 
[01:16:00]  Yeah  Obama and Robin  That was the most dullest thing  Of course it was  Really?  That's a crime against nature  Yeah  And I didn't pay for that  I still want my money back  Too stiffs  Yeah, I think a lot more people are a mixture  They pick and choose of what you like  Some people are conservative  But is it our fault, though, that we're demanding this to be an entertaining kind of podium?  It doesn't  It's supposed to be  Are we pushing it into that?  Yes  Or is it being shoved down your throat?  Yeah, a beauty contest, a popularity contest 
[01:16:30]  It has nothing to do with the actual ability to lead  No  Yeah  And wanting to classify people  What's that phrase?  Zingers  Yeah  They wanted zingers  Soundbites  I don't want a president that can deliver zingers  Well, that's what Americans need  Soundbites and zingers  Yeah, yeah  We're all about that  Who put in the phrase zinger?  That's kind of a fairly new one, isn't it?  Oh, I think that's  Real zinger  Well, he's got a real zinger  I think vaudeville  Oh, maybe it's me  I always thought it was something to do with zits and spots  Yeah, you're going to zing 
[01:17:00]  Get some proactive  You know when you burst a real good butterball  Butterball  That's a zinger  Oh, that's horrible  You smell really good, by the way  Oh, wow  He has great cologne  Christian Dior  A true gentleman  Well, when you don't wash, you've got to do something  Iraq is telling us that you have to go  We've sort of got to wrap up  You're a busy man  Busy, busy  Very busy  Yeah, and I'm going to be recording back here in a few hours 
[01:17:30]  Really?  Yeah  Nine in the afternoon, right?  Yeah  Which is nice  I like the opportunity to do that  But early in the morning  Yeah  Live singing  That's the rough nut, man  Oh, that's it  Hey, goat boy  Yeah, man  Check out Honky Donkey in an hour and a half  Man, John, what a fucking blast  There's nothing limited in it  That was fucking phenomenal 
[01:18:00]  Thank you for coming in  Yeah, right on  I appreciate that  The worst is yet to come  This is ONA's Worst of 2012  Worst of 2012  On the Opie and Anthony channel  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012  12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12  Continues right now  My name is E-Rock  I will be posting this thing for you  Like I do always  It's been a weird year for Chevy Chase  It's been a weird year for the show community on NBC 
[01:18:30]  I'm a big fan of that  I hope you are as well  But Chevy Chase has been notoriously known  For not being the most pleasant person to work with  Or just a nice person in general  I don't know the guy personally  Maybe he is  But everybody who's worked with him  Seems to think this guy is a dick  We talked to Gillian Jacobs  Almost got that wrong  And Joel McHale from Community  They're both from Community there  Talk about Chevy Chase  Plus a voicemail got leaked  By the creator of the show  Let's explore this right now  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012 
[01:19:00]  So how are things with  I'm just going to say with Chevy  Chevy's fine  Is he?  This is like the longest gig he's ever had  I think, right?  Yeah, it's only on SNL for a year  This is three years now  Wow  We're just waiting for one of them to tell the truth  To crack and actually explain  Didn't someone tell us the truth once?  Maybe  Yeah  We might have heard some things  Was it on the air or off?  It was unfortunately off  Oh damn it  Unfortunately off  One of these people  Someone's going to crack  Someone's going to crack one of these days  Thank you so much 
[01:19:30]  But it won't be on this show  We're going to make headlines  It'll be like right after they leave this show  They'll go somewhere else  When you know the show's going away  Then we'll get you people back  Looking at illegal stuff on Chevy's computer  Yeah  All the good stuff will come out  He doesn't know how to use a computer  I bet  I had to reset his Apple ID password for him once  Really?  Yeah  Was it scumbag?  No  I'm teasing of course  Gentleman  Gentleman  He does have a reputation 
[01:20:00]  I'm just saying  I'm not sure if it's true or not  I don't know the man  We almost met him once  We were in makeup together  Oh really?  He refused to acknowledge us  Yeah  Even after we said hi  Even after we said hi  Well he's hard of hearing  Is that what was going on?  Yeah  I saw him at Book of Mormon  I sat right behind him  Oh yeah?  He enjoyed it very much  Was he hooting and hollering at it?  Yeah  It's supposed to be a great show  I haven't seen it  Was it?  I don't go for the salty language  But aside from that 
[01:20:30]  Your delicate sensibility  Yeah you didn't go for that  I thought they could have taken the high road  Salty language  Did Chevy have a personality transplant?  I know this  Teasing of course  I love Chevy  I met him once  He was pleasant  Was he?  Alright there you go  That sounds good  What a rousing endorsement that is  He was pleasant  But we only spoke for a second  Nana's pleasant too  I don't want to be in a room with her  Exactly  Handed me a sugar cookie  No we only met for a second  And I annoyed him to take a photo  He's a legend you know 
[01:21:00]  Yes he is  Meeting him is like  Fletch come on  Like meeting  Fletch lives  Cops and Robertsons  Ah Cops and Robertsons  Has Joel told you  That's third on your list?  Well that's the one Joel brings up daily  Of course he does  That's great  Has Joel ever told you about Karate Dog?  No  Our obsession with Karate Dog?  No  Alright so  He is the voice  Chevy Chase is the voice of Karate Dog  Who else could be?  I know  In the movie Karate Dog  That's what you guys should Google  That's amazing 
[01:21:30]  Can we Google Karate Dog?  Yeah  Please  You have to  You're at the computer  No I'm just kidding  Wow  You're a big star  Don't do it  Jumping robot  So it is a show  It's a movie that stars Simon Rex  Look at you doing all the work  The legwork here  We have a look at my flight  We have a work at John Voight  John Voight's in it?  Yeah yeah yeah  How about his car?  And Chevy is the voice of Karate Dog  And Joel discovered it one day on  In Pablo Francisco 
[01:22:00]  Yeah Showtime  And so Joel started buying every DVD  That was under $5 on eBay of Karate Dog  And by the end of the season  He had 50 copies of it in his trailer  And the last day of shooting  He presented Chevy with 50  With all of the copies  I'm sure Chevy took the joke well and laughed  He did  He started hiding them on the set  So there was one scene where we all had to get up to a lectern  And he put a copy of Karate Dog  And it took Chevy like 15 minutes to notice it 
[01:22:30]  We thought that he was taking it really well  But then we realized he just hadn't seen it  And then when he finally found it  He was like  You prick  And like flung it at Joel  But he is hard to work with  We take much delight in Karate Dog  It's our favorite thing  Let's try to hear Chevy as Karate Dog  Seeing Eye Cat or Watch Cat  No  Oh yeah  Looks good  You want to come back to my place?  That's Chevy right there  If you were high you would never stop laughing  No  He's a party animal  Oh shit he's got a band  Oh neat 
[01:23:00]  They're playing instruments  Ah this is bullshit  Animals don't do this  He's got a literal chip  Hey are you playing poker or what?  Oh right enough  Ah  The guy got pissed on  It's great  John Voight is in this  John Voight  They're both karate masters  Is that why they have Midnight Cow Dog?  Where the dog gets blown by some kid in fucking Times Square  Please don't beat me up  And that's a good one  Yeah  Ralphie Mae and Ben Bailey  Ralphie Mae  Yes  Jamie Presley 
[01:23:30]  Simon Rex  John Voight  And the voice of Chevy Chase  That's Karate Dog  David's out  This is O&H's worst of 2012  On the Opie and Anthony channel  We got the Chevy Chase call  Oh I want to hear that  Oh they had the call they released?  Oh yeah  We got the call  And it's good  We were just talking to Gillian Jacobs the other day  Saying come on  Tell us  He's an asshole right?  We all know he's an asshole  Yeah  We've been told he's an asshole  Everyone knows he's an asshole  He's never not been an asshole  Me and Ant were in the makeup room 
[01:24:00]  The same time as this fucking jizz bag  And he wouldn't fucking talk to us  After we tried to introduce ourselves  He's an asshole  You don't think this is a work?  No  So what's the story?  I guess he walked off the set  Last day of Shooting Community this past season  Yeah so apparently they were filming the finale  And he walked off the set  Some people say it's because  He didn't think the episode was funny  And he said it's because  They didn't have a script  And so he was tired of it  And so he walked off  Then Dan Harmon 
[01:24:30]  Who's the show creator  At the wrap party  That Chevy Chase and his family were at  Had a toast  That said fuck you Chevy  And tried to get everybody to chant  Fuck you Chevy  While Chevy was in the room  While Chevy and his wife  Yeah  And so then Chevy left  An expletive laden voicemail  For Dan Harmon  Which Dan Harmon then shared  With everybody  One of those people  Was recording it  Oh  Oh very cool  So  I hear it's hard to hear though 
[01:25:00]  Unfortunately huh  It's a little hard to hear  But you can make it out  You can make out some of the shit  Alright here's Chevy Chase  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  I hope you're ready  Take your mess  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  The ladies and gentlemen  That's on the phone  Dan Harmon  That's Dan Harmon  Being an asshole to Chevy  Like ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  Because he knew he was revving up  No he's saying  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  And then he played the voicemail  Oh  Got it  Got it  There's theater for you  Right  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  I hope you're ready 
[01:25:30]  Take your medicine  You're here  Take your medicine  You fat fuck  You didn't give us a script  To be dealing with  So nobody knew  What the fuck was going on  That we were doing  During the week  Second of all  Your god damn bad writing  Shit  Sneakle  Fuck  Abomination  And your writing  Is getting worse and worse  So  I don't care  They're all laughing  Why are they laughing  They'll laugh at you  Something suspicious  Yes 
[01:26:00]  He's roasting him back  Or something  There's something weird  Something suspicious  I thought he was playing it  In front of a bunch of people  He is  And they're laughing  Yeah  Who are the bunch of people though  Probably co-workers  Because they all know  Chevy's an asshole  That's what I'm getting from it  Oh  Like they're like  They're not taking him seriously  It's like listen to this  Fucking dick  Oh okay  Yeah I think that's what it is  Because he said in the past  That he has problems with the show  He doesn't like  Oh okay  Dan Harmon  He's a dude  Why does he like community  He doesn't like  Critically acclaimed  Wouldn't most actors  Want that  He said he doesn't like 
[01:26:30]  On their resume  He doesn't think it's a funny show  And he doesn't think  His character's funny  He said  Why is he doing it  Like they'll ask him  The hacky  Like you know  You know  Are you like your character  And he goes  No I'm funny  He's funny  He's funny when  When was Chevy fucking funny  Oh god  Vacation  I can't talk to like that  By anybody  Certainly not in front of my wife and daughter  You goddamn asshole  Alcoholic fat shit  There don't have to be about 57 
[01:27:00]  If you're lucky  The way you eat  I'm not going to say to you  Except you can suck my cock  Is that clear  I hope you can play that  For everybody around you  Who agrees with you  That how she's saying  She's saying  Fuck you  In front of all those people  And me and my family  Wow  Hmm  Wow  Yeah  I mean  I don't think it's at work  No no no  You're right  I for a second thought it was  Because they were laughing  Yeah no it sounds like it's nice  But it's almost like Chevy  Don't you know  Everyone who's ever worked at you  Says that you're a douchebag 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  Everyone  Yeah  Everyone  He says he doesn't like sitcoms  But why are you doing one  Just keep doing movies  It's the calm part of it  He's got a problem with  Yeah  Jeez  It's terrible  This is going to be the last season  Of Community  Well I mean  I would think that  They would want to go on  As long as possible  They're not planning on ending it now  But like season four I guess  Is when you get into syndication  So they're excited about  Gotcha  This one  But  Well they thought that this  One that just happened  Could be the last one  After they went on hiatus  But  I don't know if season four 
[01:28:00]  I don't think it's officially  Been announced yet  But  Everybody's hoping that it happens  They haven't been picked up  But it's the second highest rated  Sitcom  Yeah  Behind the office  After they came back  They started  Murdering  Comparatively  Nice  Good for them  I like a lot of those people  It's a good show too  It's really funny  We go way back with Joel  Joel  Not so much with Chevy  No  Soup taste  I would have had a great line  If I was there too  What would you send  Hey I wish he was  He'd tell you how he really feels  That's a good one 
[01:28:30]  That is a good one  What  Probably better that you weren't there  Ah place would have went bananas  I don't think so  Sam  Chris Humphreys  Yeah  That's where the whole  Looking like a dummy in a hot tub  Started  With Chris Humphreys  I thought it was with Diddy  I don't know if it was Diddy  I thought  We were talking about Chris Humphreys  But Diddy was in the hot tub  In Biggie's video  Just looking like a dummy in a hot tub  That's true too  Yeah  But we did refer to Chris Humphreys  As the big dummy in a hot tub  He's also a dummy in a hot tub  But you know what 
[01:29:00]  He's fighting back  You know he's got that  Kim Kardashian divorce thing happening  And he refuses to sign the papers  Until she admits it's fake right  Yep  Seven million fucking dollars  They're willing to pay Chris Humphreys  And they have called him  Kind of a gold digger  And he's like  I ain't signing shit  Until this broad in her family  Admits this whole thing  Was a fake fucking wedding  Wait they'll pay him  To sign  Does he  Does he admit the whole thing was fake  Or he thought it was real  And he's realizing that he was set up  I believe his claim is that 
[01:29:30]  It was  They set it up  Without telling him  Without telling him  And he thought it was real  Yeah  And he's a fucking idiot  So that's a possibility  So wait a minute  Did fucking  What's the seven million dollar thing  They're saying if you  They're trying to settle  And say here  Here's your seven million  Sign the fucking divorce papers  And go away  And don't talk about it anymore  Right  Fuck you  Cause you  Cause you know  He's the laughing stock of the NBA  They fucking  Chan and make fun of him all the time  This is genuinely embarrassing  For the Kardashians too  To have this continue to be dragged on  Yeah  He looked like an idiot  Through this whole fucking thing  And so he's fighting back 
[01:30:00]  Saying fuck you  They like to somewhat  Control their press  Whether it's positive or negative  Just to kind of you know  He's refusing to divorce Kim  Unless she gives him  A public apology  And admits the entire wedding  Was staged by her and her family  There you go  They've offered him seven million  To shut up and go away  But he won't take it  Nope  Chris wants Kim to admit  To fraud  To admit the whole thing  Was staged for publicity  To make a public apology  To him  Because he really wanted  A marriage  So he believed it was real  He was very much in love 
[01:30:30]  And now he's starting to think  Holy fuck  These assholes set me up  Very much in love  Very much in love  He comes up like such a dolt  On that show  He's a moron  But they really fucking  If that's true  Then they really fucked him over  Then they did fuck him over  And the Kardashians  Team Kim they call it  They're attacking Humphreys  They're trying to spin Kim  As the victim  But Chris isn't going to stand for it  Good for him man  How much is his contract for  In the NBA  He might not need seven million  He might get more out of this  No one would fuck 
[01:31:00]  No one would say no  To seven million dollars  That's true  What the fuck you make  You kidding me  Gotta grieve at you  Gotta grieve at you  On that one  If he's not letting it go  For seven million  That's fucking  He's making a few million  A year easy  He is right  Oh yeah  So  Just for putting a ball  In a hoop  What about that  Perhaps  I hear ya  What's his contract  Um  What  What's his  What is he  Oh uh  Three point two million  What's that that money  I mean it's a lot  But I mean  You could use seven though  Fuck yeah  The character Chevy plays 
[01:31:30]  Is exactly like he is  On the voicemail  Maybe they're trying  Maybe they're trying  To get a little buzz out there  No he's  Should we be suspicious  Or not on that one  No that's  I mean  Travis  The voicemail is not like  Chevy's character at all  Alright  He doesn't walk around  Calling people  Drunk cocksuckers  There's another update  On Deadline's website  That says that a lot of people  That were at the cast party  Agree with Chevy's  Side of the story  That they were having a  Quote non-script day  When he walked off  So Chevy seems to be  Telling the truth there  If you're to believe 
[01:32:00]  Other people  Still comes off as a prick  Oh yeah  Absolutely  But I don't think  This is a work at all  Yeah  Oh no I think you're right  It's fine watch for a second  Plus it's I mean  It's not like  It's just like a nice guy  Who's historically  Gotten a great reputation  Coming out and looking  Like an asshole now  Right  We all knew he was  An asshole before  Nothing worse than  A fake call  Because you know  Nobody wants to hear  A work like that  It's just fucking stupid  This is Opie Anthony's  Worst of 2012 
[01:32:30]  What's up with Chevy man  There's another voice now  Here we go  Come on  Come on  Let's make some  I don't know  Some press today  Killian was here  And beautiful  And talented  And lovely  She is such a  Friggin pisser man  She's a lot of fun  And we were talking  To her about it  And was she  I don't know  She didn't say anything  Right  Officially  Her body language  Everyone always makes  A face like  Like oh that guy  So alright look 
[01:33:00]  I'll phrase it in a way  That's it  Alright Joel  We know Chevy's  The biggest prick  You've ever worked with  Who's the second  Oh  My word  I'm gonna go with Kelly  No  Kelly yeah  That ripper  It almost feels like  He's trying to sabotage  The show  Like why would you  Want to do that  The one they  I don't know  I  One of those  I got on a plane  Yesterday  And when I came off  They're like  So how about that  Voicemail  Have we heard it  One plane ride 
[01:33:30]  And then there's  Another voicemail  Another voicemail  I haven't heard  I literally  You haven't heard  The second one  You haven't heard it yet  I haven't heard it  I haven't heard it  I read a transcript of it  Why don't we hear it  I get the transcripts  From all the shows  Yeah you gotta get  The transcripts  Oh great  Look at this  Joel's like  Oh great  We might stop  I gotta work  With this guy  I'm just glad  To see a CD  I know right  That's kind of dumb  Digital  Hi Dan  It's Chevy  Oh boy  Who's he talking to  Dan 
[01:34:00]  First of all  It's just  Hi Dan  It's Chevy  And Joel just goes  Oh boy  I have a feeling  Joel might have  Had a few of these calls  Oh god  I know  Hi Joel  It's Chevy  Chevy and I  Do text each other  But the only thing  Chevy and I  Text each other  Onion headlines  That's his  Oh yeah  That was a great thing  That's our relationship  Very funny  Who's Dan again  Dan Harmon  Dan Harmon is the creator  Of the show  The creator  Okay  The creator  Chevy  Chevy Chase  I've looked at now  Three shows in a row 
[01:34:30]  That's last week  And a couple this week  I've watched more than that  But the point  I want to make is this  There's a disconnect  Somewhere  Either between  The  The  Sigh  What is actually shot  And  The  The  The humor  On  The set  When we shoot it  And  The final product 
[01:35:00]  The editing  I don't know who's doing  The editing  Me  And making the choices  That count the most  Now hold on for a second  He  He pretty much  Described  The entire show  Like it's like  There seems to be  A disconnect  Between  Everything  The acting  The  The mood  In the studio  The  The  The recording of it  The editing  Drops  I don't like the way  The credits roll at the end  But I'll tell you  This is getting  Dan Harmon leaked the first one  He played it 
[01:35:30]  And it got leaked  And he felt bad about it  He apologized for playing that message  But this is another one to him  And this is a much better quality one  Yeah  I don't know what their relationship is  But it just sounds like  He's had enough  Of hearing from this guy  And we're just speculating here  We are just speculating  I'm not even speculating  And you're not speculating  We're speculating  With you in the room  You're like a litmus paper  Thank you  He doesn't have to talk  But we can look at it  And know exactly what's going on  It also means I'm thin  That's true too  Thank you  He's moving along 
[01:36:00]  In his chair  He's a litmus paper  Yeah  Joel is fidgeting about  What was Gillian doing?  She was  She put her head down  She'd look up  And look  Out of the corner of eye  Look up  And smile a little  It was way cuter  Than what I'm doing  Oh adorable  Well you're pretty cute too  Thank you  But she also  I think I saw her mouth  Fuck that Chevy  I'm teasing of course  We don't know for sure  You can't blow up your own show  I understand that  So get to work with this person  It's a real thing  But he's being very  He's kind of  This is public stuff now 
[01:36:30]  And it's getting to a point  Where it looks like  He's the problem  It's hurting  The perception of the show  And it's a good show  But at least we are picked up  For a fourth season  Oh you are?  Good good  No we're not  Oh Jesus  I'm joking  I think it will be though  I hope so  But I'm saying  That's why I said  It almost seems sabotaging  This helps  He wants to stop Joel  Chevy didn't release this stuff  No I don't  Okay  No no  I don't know how Chevy  He didn't release this stuff  But it just seems like  He's a very difficult guy 
[01:37:00]  But if you ask Chevy  To like  We'll release a voicemail  It would be impossible  For him to figure it out  So  I'd be like  Take that off the phone  So  I want to hear that  What?  Yeah  But I will say this  The other part of the disconnect  Is that  Obviously  You don't get my humor at all  That's true  Or what it is I do  That's funny  That actually makes people laugh  I do agree with that  You've got two choices  What is he doing? 
[01:37:30]  Is that Dan Harmon?  Is that Dan talking over?  That's Dan talking over  That's Dan talking over  Wow  Well it's  Yeah  That's true  Wow that's brutal  I guess it's not technically a voicemail  Wow  No  He's fucking commenting on it  Wow  Or maybe Dan's voicemail is set up  That it just  It'll agree with what you're saying  Yeah I agree with that  That would be great  Or is this a discussion?  A lot of people  No no  This is a voicemail  Oh he's as high as Chevy  I think he's just fucking  Giving his comments  Over the voicemail  As he's recording it  Oh I think  He's talking  Yeah  Wow 
[01:38:00]  I do agree with that  Two choices  One is storyline  The other is  You know  Like everybody gives a shit  About the fucking story  When they don't even know  Who the fucking characters are  Oh  Yes  Or there's make people laugh  Now you know what I do  And I don't appreciate  You know  Like a great joke  Like  The cast being ripped off  My  You know  And  Pointing out  All the funny things  Are on 
[01:38:30]  In my cast  That I've tried  To scratch  Not the cast  And it's just  Right  It's just cut out  There's just one line  About some kind of  A thing I eat  That was in my cast  When you had  Big laughs  That's just physical  I'm just talking  About laughing  Again  Tonight  I'm looking at  Two  I'm doing  In that  Place  On a wheelchair  It's cut  Down  Down  Down  Down  So that what 
[01:39:00]  So that people  Can follow the  Storyline  Between Joel  And  And Gillian  Hey  Uh oh  And love affairs  And kissing  Come on man  You're missing  The point  I mean  I really  This is not  My kind of comedy  I thought you hired me  For what I can do  That's funny  You gotta give me  Some range  And then you don't  Have some  Editor with no  Sense of humor  No sense 
[01:39:30]  No sense of me  Cutting things down  To the point where  I just look like  I don't like it  And you know  I should have had this  Talk to you  Face to face  But I didn't want to  Because I really  Like you  I think your  Writing is great  I think everything  You do is great  But the problem  Really is Dan  You're not there  When we shoot  And you're not there  When they edit  So you don't even  Know what you have  You don't even know  What it is 
[01:40:00]  I'm f***ing doing  And if you want me  On this f***ing show  Again  I got news for you  I don't want it  It's just a f***ing  Mediocre sitcom  Wow  I want people to laugh  And this isn't funny  And it ain't funny to me  Because I'm 67 years old  And I've been doing this  A long time  Every year of it  And I've been making  A lot of people laugh  A lot better than this  Joel  Good times  Joel, comment 
[01:40:30]  Everything's comfortable  All the time  Good times  That is a little  A little  Well, here's the good news  Yes, sir  That was apparently  From what I read  Was over a year old  Really?  So  Oh, is that a year old?  That's the other thing  It's a year old  See, we didn't know that  And he's  So he came back  So it all worked out  So it all worked out  Everything is good now  That's very good  No, that was the other thing  Because it said in the article  At least I think it was  The Huffington Post article 
[01:41:00]  It was like  This is from over a year ago  Or a year ago  Because he said he's 67  He's almost 69 now  Oh, man  Wow  So  Well, did they  The plot thickens  Whoever  Do you think they  Do you think they  Gave him what he wanted?  More of the funny?  Yeah  Well, more importantly  Why are these voicemails  Coming out now  Right  That's what  That's what  Confuses me  Who has them?  And why do they  They feel like  They need to release  Right  Somebody's trying  To sabotage something  Or get him 
[01:41:30]  Why would the creator  Do that  If they're trying  To get picked up  For a fourth season  I don't know  I mean, I don't know  It's his voicemail  So it starts with him  Yeah, I don't  But I don't know  Where, you know  In a year's time  What happens to those things  Right  Yeah, but you know  What's great  Is that it's great  To talk about  It's fun  Right  It's fun  It's so uncomfortable  It's good times  It's a great buzz  It's like being on the Kardashians  No matter what  It's all good press  What was the first sign  That there was something  I'm not saying 
[01:42:00]  You have trouble with them  What was the first sign  That there was tension  Because you see tension sometimes  What was the first sign  That there was going to be  Some kind of a tension  Was it an argument  With a writer  Or was it  I think  Like the second day of work  Chevy strangled an extra  No  Boy, you know  I swear to you  When I say this  That the cast  Does get along well  And Chevy is very  He can be very warm on set  Yeah  But you know 
[01:42:30]  Just like everyone  Can get into bad moods  Well  Like Jim  When you walked in  You literally slapped me  In the face  But I don't mind being  But honestly  We all get pissy here  We do  It's part of  It's part of a working relationship  People tend to hear  When we are  Because they can hear us  Yeah  In a live moment  So they kind of know  Like he's feeling shittier  And is right  Whatever  But on sitcoms  It happens too  And it's just  With this now  It's become a public  Right  Now everyone  Yeah  And it looks divisive  Because they're not  Taping that stuff usually  Right  No  And it's like  You know  It's Chevy being Chevy  See but the reputation 
[01:43:00]  Is terrible for him  And it's like  You don't want to believe it  Like not you  But I mean like myself  It's like alright  Everybody says he's a hard guy  To work with  And he's a funny dude  Yeah  But he's difficult to work with  And nobody likes him  And then he's like  He's on this show  With a much younger cast  It's almost like  A more relevant thing  Than he's done in a long time  Yeah  And he's just  Motherfucking everybody  It's like  Do you not see  That you're the common denominator  In every situation you're in  It's you  Look  Anyway  What's great about  These Cure songs  You want to go with 
[01:43:30]  Just Like Heaven  That was the one  I was trying to come up with  Just Like Heaven  Yes  That's what I was trying to come up with  That's what I want to say  What the set is like  Oh yeah  See if you played this song  Underneath the voicemail  Underneath the voicemail  It would sound much better  Yeah go ahead  Play a little bit of the voicemail  Well I guess I could do that  Oh you put it away  Well  I did put it away  See that's how you work  Oh god bless you  Here start this over  Because this is a long intro  Yeah  But this intro really  Like you know  Oh the intro  Makes it exciting  I hated it  See  Um  Chevy 
[01:44:00]  Chevy Chase  This sounds like  The beginning of a great  80's movie  Yeah  I've watched it now  Three shows in a row  I feel like we're about to  Hit a dance  Wait was that other  Was that other voicemail  That went public recent  I've watched more  That one was recent  Oh that's why  Okay that's why he  Released the other one  He's probably tired of getting these  I would listen to this song  Yeah  You know something  I gotta be honest with you  If a cask gets taken off  Of your leg  And a bunch of stuff falls out  That you've been scratching  Your leg with  Yeah  That's pretty fucking funny 
[01:44:30]  And that would  That happened  We showed that  When it opened up  He had like nine  Pepperoni sticks  And everything he had  Shoved in there  To scratch  He had a scratch  Yeah he had hangers  So I agree with that  That's kind of funny  Plastic knives  Yeah and that all happened  Did it make the final cut  It did make that  It made the final cut  There's uh  You know because  The  Well he was wearing  A body cast in that  And we thought  That he had stolen a pen  So we sawed it off  And sawed his cast off  And when he took it off 
[01:45:00]  We were all  Almost vomited  From the smell  That was all in the script  So that all went well  I thought that was  A good episode  That was  Actually it was  It was the bottle episode  Which we were just  Looking for a pen  And um  Does it bother you  To hear him mention  Your name like that  Because he's not  Motherfucked  He's not saying  You're not funny  JJ saying my name  Excites me  But is it annoying  No one sees that  Like in the context of  How come you're showing  This and not  My thing  Well I disagree with him  About story  I think it's important to  You have to tell the story 
[01:45:30]  And tell great jokes  At the same time  To forward it along  But that's kind of  Like a weird  Like well darn it  These stories  No uh  But uh  But yeah no  I  That doesn't bother me  Oh yeah  Yeah it gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Coming up  This  Is  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Worst of 2012  For the Opie and Anthony

[02:09:00]  We're going to talk about you next  Oh shit  And there he goes  Back to his show  He goes on his show  The day after Sam's wedding  Just blows up my spot  I'm like  We've been saving it for our show  Oh man  We were saving this for some filler  Saving it for one  We ran out of shit to talk about  What a weird week  What a weird fucking week  It's been fun man  It's been a good time  Hell's hero  Absolutely  Now  Harlem Mews  Harlem Mews  That's her old name  It works  Yeah  Is your wife listening? 
[02:09:30]  She's at the doctor's office right now  So she doesn't know that you just did that?  No  She knows I was going to do it  She said  She's ready for you to do it?  Yeah she was ready a while ago  Aha  Thank you everyone  Really  Yeah this is great news  No the Twitter's been  Wow thank you so much  I'll have a real moment for a second  Thank you very much  With no sarcasm after that  A lot of nice tweets coming in  Thank you  Alright let's get out of here  Yes  When do you start buying girls toys? 
[02:10:00]  I don't know what to do with this  You don't do you?  Not a clue  Oh man  Jess is so excited  People know though  You don't have to  I repel around with my son  It's like  I know what to do with a boy  We already kind of have a thing going on here  That sounds way too much like Jerry Sandusky  I know what to do with a boy  But what do you do with a girl?  What do you do?  I don't know  Jess is so excited  You buy him dresses and bows  And then when they get into sports  You got to make believe 
[02:10:30]  Their sports are as important as male sports  Yeah softball  Baseball  Barbie dolls  Sure  Field hockey  You get them Barbie dolls and bows for their hair  Yeah  And a kitten  Yeah  And um  Hmm  If you buy him  You don't have to do anything with him  I don't know  You don't have to  I have no idea  What are you doing?  It's not  It's certainly not in my DNA  You got to take her  You know what to do with a  You know  You do have to take her to Disney  A son  You do have to take her to Disney at some point 
[02:11:00]  Yeah  Because then she wants to dress like a princess  And all that  I would like to know about you as a father  If you bought her Barbies  And your son started playing with the Barbies  Is that cool?  Or would you take them away?  Jesus Christ  I know what Aunt Sam would do  Son of a bitch  It would  What the hell are you trying to fucking pull here?  You know  It's cool  It's cool  Okay  I'm hoping that's not the case  It is what it is  Just cause that would be a tough life  You wouldn't want to see the sailor hat on  Like the parade  The shorts 
[02:11:30]  The rainbow flag  Your son starts cutting the legs off all his jeans  What are you doing now?  Oh my god  Right  I would be all in to be totally honest with you  But you know  But I think  All in  Don't put it that way  Jesus  Now you're really saying  Jerry Sandusky  Yeah  But like I think almost every single father  You just hope that it's not  But I'd be all in  I wouldn't be  Easiest possible life  I wouldn't be an asshole dad  Well that's a good  That's a good question  What if she wants to  Marry a guy that's 
[02:12:00]  Like 20 years older than her  Honestly I wouldn't care  Yeah  My in-laws  Some young shock jock  I was about to say  What's worse  My in-laws are way  Way past all that  What's worse coming through the door  A Stanley T  Or an aunt  Oh boy  Let's go home  I just know  You don't want me coming to the door  Believe me  Alright  He's going to be much too good a father 
[02:12:30]  Yeah  I answer by not answering  He's actually going to raise her well  And she won't have daddy issues  Therefore  There you go  You wouldn't be there  12 months worth of shows  More than 1,000 hours of audio  Trimmed down to just 20 or so hours  Of essential listening  What's that?  That's 20 hours of  Mind-blowing radio  Translation  We wasted close to 980 hours  Of your time this year  Sorry  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Yeah 
[02:13:00]  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Worst of 2012  For the Opie and Anthony show  My name is Irock  Nicholas Cage is in studio  This was  This was pretty cool  Because Nicholas Cage  Is a  He's a big deal  If you don't know  He's been in tons of movies  I'm not going to list them all  Just go to IMDB  And you can see  But he's in studio  He's been up  I think he was up all night  He went to an opera  That was like 6 hours long  The guy's insane  But we had a good time  He was really cool 
[02:13:30]  And here it is  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Nicholas Cage  How are you sir?  How you doing man?  Take a seat  Make yourself at home  There you go  Talking about the Grammys  Yeah we were just kind of  Yapping about it  I didn't see any of it  So I'm the last guy to ask  No  You're a guy  Likes music though  Sure of course  Rock right?  You're kind of a rock guy  Pretty eclectic  Yeah  We're actually on  So pull the mic up a little bit  We're on right now?  Yeah we just do that 
[02:14:00]  Oh good  We just like pop right on  Nice to know  Yeah  Figured I'd let you know  What do you mean by eclectic?  What do you like?  In general  What I mean is I like a little bit of everything actually  Jazz  Predominantly classical  But I love 50s, 60s, 70s rock  Yeah  The stuff you heard on the radio  A million times or  No  No  I tend to  I'll look around  I'll go into iTunes  And find things  And then  They have that beautiful thing called Genius 
[02:14:30]  And then they give me recommendations  Right  Right  I just found a band called Kasabian  Which I like out of England  And then also I'm a big fan of Filter  Oh wow  They really did some amazing stuff  Yeah  Absolutely  You keep tabs on still what's going on in music these days  Or you kind of fall off a little bit  I you know  I went to the Met just the other day  And I sat through six hours of  Go to Damarung  Wow  Partner opera by myself  Jesus  And it was interesting because I'm walking through the lobby 
[02:15:00]  And this woman looks at me and goes  Well what's a Hollywood thing like you doing at the Met  And I went wow  That's not very nice  Yeah is that supposed to be a compliment?  No  I said can't an actor enjoy a bit of opera?  Yeah  And she's like well you're the only one  And I said well there's a first time for everything  And then she said well you must be from Europe  What the hell is  Wow this is sort of like you're segregating me from Hollywood 
[02:15:30]  Well I guess the perception is that you're much too  Hollywood people much too shallow to enjoy something like that  I guess  Yeah  I can't do opera  You can't do it?  No  I just can't do it  I understand  I'll go classical  I'll do a few different genres  But opera is rough for me man  You have to really hang with it until it  Once  You gotta spend like a couple hours with it  And then you get into it  But I understand  It is hard to get  I went once  And they actually have like the subtitles 
[02:16:00]  In front of you on the seat  Which is great  If you need to understand the story  Which is great  It's like yeah  Because I don't know Italian  No  No it really helps  Because then you can understand the show  Yeah  And that's what helps you get into it  Okay yeah  Because I don't know what the heck's going on man  It seems like one long drawn out song  It's someone with a Viking hat  But if you look at it carefully  I mean it's amazing how much has been influenced by it  Like John Williams  Right  Tolkien  The Lord of the Rings 
[02:16:30]  All of it comes out of those Wagner operas  Yeah  It's the source  So if you go into it knowing that  You know you're going into like the cell  You know the root  It is  When you watch it  Especially at the Met  They put on amazing shows there  These stage sets are astounding  That thing that's on the stage  Which is like a series of miniature monoliths  From 2001  It costs like 25 million dollars  It's amazing  Then they had to spend another 16 million  Because it was too heavy for the stage  To reinforce the stage 
[02:17:00]  It's like is opera really doing this well  Yeah  Who's buying opera records  Who's paying for this  Things are on elevators  And they're going up and down and moving  It's astounding what's going on in that place  It really was extraordinary  But yeah  No that's what I mean by eclectic  And I do like rock music very much so  Well rock's gone away  Yeah it's hard to find  It's unbelievable  Any good new rock  It's pretty sad  Well U2 just is enormously confident always  Yeah yeah  I've always loved U2  That's for sure 
[02:17:30]  To this day  Really quick about opera  When do you know when you've seen a bad opera  When you're just completely bored out of your mind  Yeah  Yeah  Sitting there don't care about the show  But I love the orchestral music as well  So I'm very familiar with it  So it's very hard for me to be bored with a Wagner opera  Fair enough  It is interesting how music like that  Especially when you're watching a show  And it builds  Could just give you goosebumps 
[02:18:00]  Like that  I was crying  Really?  I was literally by myself  I'm probably the only guy that listens to opera  And actually starts crying  But when Siegfried dies  He's the most tragic character in the history  Spoiler  Spoiler  You know  And then the effects where his blood goes into the water  And it's all on the stage  And then the music  I know it  So it's  I got very emotional  That  Which I was trying to quickly like  Like dry my eyes  So no one could see me crying  Was the stuffy old broad  Giving you crap about that too?  A Hollywood man like you  Weeping at an opera? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  All by myself  Yeah  By yourself  By yourself  And from there  I went on Saturday Night Live  Right  Right  Maybe it was tears of fear  That I had to go live in like 20 minutes  What an interesting evening you had  That's a great night  I don't know who goes from six hours of Wagner  Right into SNL  You actually have to sit there for six hours  Six hours  Wow  Wow  But I found it empowering  It was an amazing experience  As long as I've sat for anything 
[02:19:00]  Maybe three  Imagine having to  You know  Yeah  Had SNL treat you  Great  Yeah  Great  Yeah  They've done some  They've done some parodies of you on that show before  Hilarious  Oh hell yeah  Yeah  You've been parodied a lot  Yes  By people and stuff  How do you feel about that?  Do you like it?  I have to go with the adage  That any form of imitation is flattering  Yeah  Otherwise I'm going to be in hell  So I'm going to go with that  Everybody that does an imitation of you  Always does the over the top 
[02:19:30]  Right  Nick Cage kind of character  That you've portrayed in a few movies  I find him very funny  And kind of  Yeah  Well the thing is that  Samberg has made it his own  Yeah  He has a very abstract impression of me  Right  I just let him do it  You know  It's not exactly me  But it's wonderful in its own right  So  Yeah  Yeah  Sometimes it doesn't have to be an accurate portrayal  But there's a piece of it  That is  Is kind of accurate  And it  Makes the whole thing work  I think so  Yeah 
[02:20:00]  New movie  Ghost Rider  Spirit of Vengeance  Yeah  Spirit of Vengeance  Now  You've been a part of a couple of franchises  Haven't you?  This is the second one  The other one is National Treasure  National Treasure  Which all of them do very well man  Well thanks  They're cool movies  I like that whole puzzle kind of a thing  Yeah  And  Yeah  What I like about Spirit of Vengeance  Is just how pop art the movie is  It really does feel like you're reading a comic book 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  There's a  There's a  A quality to it  That it's just a little bit abstract  A little bit artificial  And then real  But it mixes it all up  And  And  It's pretty gutsy for a studio  To make a movie that's this psychedelic  Yeah  It is cool  When you're doing something with a comic book  Character  Because you can kind of  Go off a reality  And  People won't go like  Oh yeah  That can't happen  It's like hey  It's a comic book  Yeah exactly  Look my face is on fire 
[02:21:00]  Right  Come on  You know  And that provides a context  Where I can go as abstract as I want  Go as  Outside the box as I want  When I'm acting  If I want to get really big  It's fine  Because look my head's on fire  And people say  Well I don't understand the ghost writer  Exactly  You're not supposed to understand  Yeah  He's a bad dream  Do you understand your bad dreams?  You know  Yeah  Do you ride?  I do ride  And I love riding  Motorcycles to me  Are the most  Symbiotic relationship 
[02:21:30]  You can have with a machine  When you get on a bike  You are one with it  And the Yamaha  Who I do not have a contract with  I am not a sponsor  I think is the best motorcycle in the world  Wow  Because I can go 140 miles an hour  And do it safely  And tell it to stop  And it will stop safely  Oh man  140 miles an hour  Yeah  I'm more a car guy  Like I like fast cars  True  Because I think there's this  False perception  That you're a little safer 
[02:22:00]  With that metal around you  Than you are on a bike  But I don't think that's  That's entirely true  This is just something about a bike  That scares the crap out of me  Well you are safer  With all that metal around you  Oh okay  Of course you're going fast in the car  But the Formula One guys know  That the racing motorcyclists  They're it  They're really the superstars of racing  It is ballsy man  When you watch those guys lay it down  And put their knee on the pavement  It's crazy  I love that  And the guy that I was working with 
[02:22:30]  In Ghost Rider  Rick English  I have to give him some props here  Because he  The man is an acrobat on a motorcycle  He's doing front endo wheelies  And spinning in circles  And back  It's just mystical  How he does it  I don't know  How do you start to do that  Yeah  I never understood that  Yeah  When you see this crazy trick  You go  Okay how did you start  And how do you do that  For the first time  Right  And even skaters too  How do they  Go up the ramp  And then do a flip  In the air  And land back down  And not break their neck  Yeah 
[02:23:00]  You know it didn't  You know it didn't work out  Well the first time  Of course not  And eventually you got to go  Okay I'm going to try this  Officially for the first time now  Yeah  And it's going to go either way  Right  Yeah  That's balls  It sure is  Yeah  Are you a car guy also  You like  I used to be  I used to be  During the gun  In 60 seconds  Once you get into motorcycles  It's very hard  To go back to cars  Because nothing really compares  To that feeling  Plus you can  You can beat the traffic  Don't you know  Find it annoying 
[02:23:30]  When you see the guy  On the bike  You're just going  Right down the highway  And everyone else  I always fear for their lives  That somebody  Is going to open a car door  Is either going to change lanes  Or try to you know  Move in there  Nothing by respect for those guys  They're never in traffic  They don't have to worry about traffic  I drive in that monster  You know Escalade  And people don't see me  Not seeing motorcycles  Is just  Yeah  That's a comfortable car  I just like the size of something  So when I'm driving 
[02:24:00]  You know  Especially in New York City  It's a battle  With the cabs and everything  It's very difficult to drive in this city  I drive a Dodge Ram truck  Oh okay  And what's amazing about that car  Is it's really great for the environment  Because it's a diesel engine  Oh okay  And actually  Some of these hybrid cars  With electric batteries  Are not so good with the environment  Because you have to  The battery eventually  Is going to die out  Then you have to make another one  Which is not great for the environment  Yeah batteries are very toxic 
[02:24:30]  Exactly  And very hard to kind of get rid of  They cost a lot of money  And use energy  When you try to actually recycle them  Right  So a diesel truck  Is actually probably better  In my opinion  Are you much of an environmentalist  And stuff  Do you  I care  Yeah  I do care  I don't want to see  The you know  The tigers go extinct  Well no  I just found out  The rhino  The black rhino  Is now extinct  I mean it's crazy  I don't like that either  But is it really  Like car exhaust  That's doing that  Or is it people  Just chopping down there  There's that  And there's also car exhaust  Yeah deforestation  And stuff like that 
[02:25:00]  Yeah yeah  I like that stuff  But I'm also  From the school of thought  That we're kind of  On this planet  And you know  You know  Just like everything else  We have a cause and effect  And you know  For our creature comforts  It's going to cost something  Well that's true  But you can do it  In a way that's prudent  Yeah  You know  Just be a little bit  Somewhere in between  Would be a nice day  Consider it  Well I understand  About the trees  Believe me  I'm not just  The black rhino  Is beautiful  Yeah  Why don't you want that around  It's gone 
[02:25:30]  It's gone now  Scientists will bring it back  When your kid says  Daddy I love the black rhino  I love rhinoceros  I'd like to go see one  You say it doesn't exist anymore  But it did  Just three years ago  Oh man yeah  We lost it three years ago  No we lost it  I think this year  It was  We couldn't say  The remaining few  It was declared  Officially extinct  This year  Wow  You think scientists  Will be able to bring  That stuff back eventually  Probably  But I don't  That's another  Slippery slope  Yeah  Cloning and all that  I don't know  What that would lead to  In terms of diseases 
[02:26:00]  And things  Yeah  They have like  They're now breeding  Fish tomato hybrids  Because there's something  In the fish  That preserves the tomato  So they're mixing the two  What can that cause  Oh that doesn't sound good at all  It doesn't sound tasty  And there are people  That believe that  They're  And I don't know this  I mean I don't want to sound  Like a conspiracy theorist  But there are people  That do believe  They're actually  Cloned humans  In full  Living  I would assume  I would believe  I would assume  Scientists all over the world 
[02:26:30]  That have been working on this  Somebody's gonna  You know  Not be as ethical  As the rest  What are their rights  That's where  What could Shakespeare do with that  The clone  Right  And the donor  What do they  Yeah  Does he have any say  Over his clone  Does the clone have any say  Over his life  Yeah his life  And how do you  And how do you  Turn it into an opera  Yeah exactly  That's next  That's next  Nick just sitting there  Crying over some poor clone  Poor clone  Yeah 
[02:27:00]  A clone  It could happen  You never know man  I have rights  I'm not just a clone  That would be  Very odd  To think that  You could clone  Your own being  Perhaps  Without a mind  Yeah  And just harvest  Various organs  That you need  Yeah  Well I think all this  Cloning  Talk is because  Just the other night  On SNL  Samberg said  I was his clone  So that whole thing  Started and got me  Thinking again about  Cloning  I didn't see your  Appearance 
[02:27:30]  It was a surprise  On SNL  Yeah  They like to keep it  A surprise  Yeah they come out  And everybody goes  Woo  I love that  Yo  I want to see Ghost Rider  Man I can't wait  It's fun  In theaters Friday Nick  That's right  It's in theaters  Spirit of Vengeance  Yeah Spirit of Vengeance  And who's in this  With you by the way  The magnificent  Idris Elba  Yes  Who's got this  Wonderful larger than  Life presence  Yeah  Johnny Whitworth  This guy is full of 
[02:28:00]  Surprises  There's nobody else  Quite like him  Karen Hines  Plays Satan  Who you might have  Seen in the Rome series  And any other  Number of wonderful  British productions  Great actor  Violante Placido  Is the lady in the movie  Effortless  Charming actress  I mean great cast  And what's the gist  Of this  I'm working with  The church this time  Believe it or not  I have to go  And find  The devil's son  And bring him  To a monastery  In Turkey  And have him exercised 
[02:28:30]  And that idea  Actually came to me  Because when I was  Promoting the first movie  I was in England  And I was dressed  As ghostwriter  I used to like  To wear the leather jacket  The leather pants  And the biker boots  And on my lunch break  On a lark  I went to Westminster Abbey  Not knowing that  I was walking  Into an environmental summit  Between the Archbishop  Of Canterbury  And the Pope  Of the Greek Orthodox Church  And there I was  Sitting in the back  And then a bishop  From Colorado  Looked at me  And went  Oh I didn't know  It was you  If I had known 
[02:29:00]  It was you  I would have  Invited you  To sit with me  Let me introduce you  So there I was  Shaking hands  With the Archbishop  Of Canterbury  And the Pope  Of the Greek Orthodox Church  Dressed like Ghostwriter  And then the bishop  From Colorado  Leans over  And he whispers  In my ear  Oh and by the way  I can be naughty too  Whoa  What does that mean  Yikes  And I was like  Okay what do I do  With that  I've got it  Let's have Ghostwriter  Working with the church  Wow  Inspired like that  In a second 
[02:29:30]  And then that's how  Spirit of Vengeance  Happened  You got some  Experiences  I've had some  Experiences  I like that  I'm lucky  Yeah right  Yeah  Have you always been  Adventurous  I try to be  I mean I see life  As a gift  And that to just  Sit there on the couch  And watch TV  Is probably the biggest  Sin  Unless you're watching  Your movies  Yeah well that I don't do  But you need to  Take this time  This gift of time  That we have  And do something  With it  And experience it  Stop playing around 
[02:30:00]  And do nothing  Yeah  I like doing stuff  I just  I could do it tomorrow  Well  Nah  I'm kidding of course  Tomorrow comes very quickly  I know  And many tomorrows  Stack up very quickly  It's starting to go by  Way too fast  You said something there  You don't watch your own movies  No  Even just once  No I'll watch it once  And then move on  And then that's it  Yeah  And if there is a time  Where you're kind of  Sitting down  And the TV's on  And you see something  Shut it off  Wow  Do you realize  Your movies are very  You can watch them many times  Well that's nice  They're very watchable 
[02:30:30]  Well thank you  Yeah  What's the reasoning  Behind not watching  The reasoning is that  I want to move on  I don't want to dwell on the past  It's kind of like  What we were just talking about  Okay  What's next  And also  I don't want my family  To see me  I don't want my six year old  To see me  And be confused by that  Oh really  Try to keep it as normal  As I can  That's interesting  With being somebody like me  Yeah  I'd be bragging  All over the place  Hey I just realized  Thanks to our listeners  That's  Stringer Bell  In this movie  From The Wire 
[02:31:00]  Yeah  Oh yeah  Holy shit  Idris Elba right  Idris Elba yeah  Yeah I didn't know  His real name  And Lambert makes an appearance  Christopher Lambert  Remember  From  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Christopher  Highlander  Right  Highlander  Yeah  The movie  Wicker Man  Yeah  I liked that movie  And then  The end  Was like  Holy Jesus  It was  Did you have any  Any reservations  About an ending 
[02:31:30]  Of a movie like that  Like  No  I think  Neil Lebut  Is famously known  For having a kind of  Twisted ironic  Sense of humor  Wow  And  Yeah  I don't know if you saw  His movie  In the company of men  And I knew  Working with him  That we could go  To some places  That would  Really kind of  Push it a little bit  Now when you go  Running around  In a bear suit  Knocking out  A village of women  Who are blowing  Like Viking horns 
[02:32:00]  You know  It's  Somewhat absurd  Right  And  So the  The flavor of that movie  Was a mix of being  Ridiculous  And also  Scary  The  The worst  Thing about it  Was the fact that  Right up until  The end  There was this  Weird  Hope that you were  Gonna  Somehow get out  Of that bad situation  And not be horribly  Burned to death  Yeah  And then when it happens  You're just kind of like  No  This is  This is a bummer 
[02:32:30]  Right  It's probably  If you see the original  It's probably  The ultimate bummer  Of any movie  Of all time  Yeah  The way that movie ends  Is profound  The way you feel  And it goes on for weeks  I couldn't shake it for weeks  Yeah  It's one of those  That like  It just kind of  Leaves you with this  Awful feeling  It's  The original  The original  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I  No  Yours too  Was like  Just kind of  What  Oh god  That's  It's a horrible way  To die  And  Well originally  When I did 
[02:33:00]  The Wicker Man  I wanted to play  The cop with like  A handlebar mustache  And I really  Have one  One of these like  Macho guys  Who's just  Completely absurd  But the producers  Wouldn't let me do it  I think people  Might have understood  A little more  Like the bloggers  And the YouTube folks  That we were kind of  In on the joke  If I didn't  Okay  Had the handlebar mustache  But they  They said look  We paid this amount  For you to be in the movie  You will not be wearing  A mustache  It's your mistake  If they don't get it  Oh god 
[02:33:30]  I would love to see  With a handlebar mustache  That would have been  You know  Yeah that might have  Helped me  It's like  Ah the guy with  The handlebar mustache  Come on  It's a  It's a goof  Also  Kick ass  Yeah  I love kick ass  Such a fun  And edgy movie  Being a father  Did you have any  Reservations about  The girl  The young girl  Using that language  No  No  Because I knew  That movie was  Totally ironic  And that  It was a farce 
[02:34:00]  In many ways  And Chloe  Moretz  Is just  Extraordinary  In that film  Oh she was adorable  Adorable  And just  Hysterical  There's something  About when  Somebody that  Innocent looking  Is saying  And doing  Horrific things  That becomes  Funny  It becomes  You laugh at it  Well I think  I think  All humor  Comes from  Surprise  Comes from  A level of  Shock  On some  That's why  We have things  Like schadenfreude 
[02:34:30]  Where people  Laugh when  Somebody falls  Down  Which is  Kind of a  Perverse statement  About society  In itself  Sure  But there  It is  It exists  And I think  When people  See things  That just  Are not  Right  It makes  Them laugh  I don't like  The way people  Try to  Try to  Hide that  And try to  Make it like  We're  We're better  Than that  Right  I think it's  Just a basic  Human nature  To find  Humor in that  I don't think  It means that 
[02:35:00]  We all  Want somebody  To get hurt  Or something  But there's  Something just  Inherently funny  About somebody  Else's misfortune  Well it's a  Coping skill  Probably on some  Level  Like even in  Spirit of Vengeance  John Blaze  Is much more  Sarcastic in this  Movie  He's much edgy  He's much more  Cynical  And I always  Thought of him  As sort of like  Some of the  Cops or paramedics  That I've met  Who developed  This incredibly  Dark sense of  Humor  To cope with  The horrors  That they've seen  And I mean  They say some 
[02:35:30]  Things that you  Just would not  Believe that  Could come out  Of their mouth  Oh yeah  Yeah  But they do it  Because if they  Don't they can't  Really handle it  Right  Yeah  That's a  Way to put it  Yeah  That's quite true  What did you have  To go through  As far as  Makeup and special  Effects on that  To have your head  Burning  The CGI  The CGI is minimal  In the movie  They dial all  That in  Later  Like clearly  It's a flaming  Skull  Yeah  But in order  To believe  I was the 
[02:36:00]  Character on  Some level  And not feel  Completely absurd  I would  Paint my face  To have like  Skull makeup  So I'd use  Black and white  Paint  I would black  Out my eyes  So you would  See no white  No people  With black  Contact lenses  And I would  Walk on the set  Looking like that  And I wouldn't  Say a word  To anybody  So it was  Just very  Uncomfortable  For everybody  And that made it  So it was like  I didn't have to act  Because I could see  The fear in their eyes  And then it was like  Oxygen to a forest fire 
[02:36:30]  Where I just  Believed that was  The spirit of vengeance  That's something  I think people  Have learned over the years  With CGI and stuff  And I know  Peter Jackson used it  With the  Gollum character  Yeah  He actually had  I can't remember  His name offhand  But the actor  Walking around like that  And I think it does help  When there's something  CGI  To have  Yeah that other  Someone you can act with  It also helps  The other actors  Yeah  Because it gives them  A chance to  React honestly  You know  Yeah 
[02:37:00]  So that's what  That process was like  Looking forward to it  When does that come out?  Friday?  Friday  Yeah this Friday  Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance  I want to ask them  About the Civil War thing  People are saying  You might be a vampire  Right  Right  I read this  And I'm like  What?  It's a long stretch  Of course  But it's basically  Gone viral  I guess  Someone found a picture  Of an old Civil War guy  That looks just like  Nick Cage  Yeah  Nicholas Cage  But I say politely  That I think  It's a slowed version 
[02:37:30]  Of me  Oh is it?  I think so  I've only heard about this  I gotta see the picture  Really fast  Come on  Oh my god  It's you twisted though  Yeah it's twisted  Yeah you look  That's fucked up  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  But what's funny about that  Is like people  Don't want to let it go  Like I went on Letterman  And said I am not  A vampire  I don't drink blood  But the very fact  That I said I'm not  A vampire  Is creating some sort  Of viral thing  Like well clearly  He would say  He's not a vampire 
[02:38:00]  So he could defend  His position as a vampire  Only a vampire  Would say he's not  A vampire  Right  If I didn't know any better  I would assume  That was some role you did  That's kind of creepy  How much you look like him  Well I mean  It's twisted version  Yes of course  Like his little makeup  Yeah  Yeah he looks like  He's had some type of accident  Yeah  I don't see that  So what is  This guy is from  The Civil War  Is that what they're saying?  I think that's what they're saying  Yeah  So there's a chance  That I have a relative  From the south 
[02:38:30]  The deep south  Imagine  Maybe you're just related  To that guy  I mean that's just  One of your ancestors  He could have been  One of my ancestors  Yeah  Oh man  That's pretty funny  But he will not let it go  I don't know how you go  From that to vampire  But okay  Yeah  Yeah  I like to know  Who was just browsing  Pictures of Civil War people  And went  Holy shit  It's Nick Cage  What's funny about that picture  Is the guy was trying to sell it  For actually a million dollars  On eBay  Come on  And I don't know  What he did with it  But now it's getting  All this attention  Maybe he'll actually get it 
[02:39:00]  Maybe he'll hit his mark  I don't know  Sam I'll retweet that shit  You know  You know he wants you  Signing that thing  He does  Well  That's pretty  Ah what the hell  That's a good story  You've got a good story right there  Yeah it gives me something  To talk about  He's like he's at it  He's like no  He's talking about  Spirit of Vengeance  Are you trying to say  Are you trying to say  You have enough to talk about  You don't need to be  Discussing whether  Whether or not  You're a vampire  Maybe  Yeah  It was  It was on  It was in an email  I got last night  And I'm like  What  Yeah 
[02:39:30]  Really  Does this even  Have to be addressed  Yeah  It's everywhere  What is it now  We're living in like  Vampire culture  Right  Yeah  Twilight  People are really hot  About vampires  Yeah vampires seem to be  The thing  Vampires and zombies  But they're like  Sexy vampires or something  I don't know  Although Dracula  Was kind of a sexy  Kind of a  You know  Guy  But I'm not  The true story  About Dracula  And or actually  Bram Stoker's  Reason for Dracula 
[02:40:00]  Would actually make  A great movie  Because it actually  Emanated from Rhode Island  Really  Far from here  Back during  I don't know how many  It was like over  A hundred years ago  When there was like  A very puritanical  Culture  Like around the time  Of the Salem witch trials  And this guy  Actually had to  Was told that  His deceased daughter  Was haunting  The family  And he was told  By like a priest  That you have to go  Into the tomb  And open it  And put a stake  Through the heart 
[02:40:30]  And that will stop it  And that story went  Viral in those days  By whatever means  And it actually  Got to Bram Stoker  And then he connected  That to Dracula  Or Vlad Tepes  In Romania  And put the two together  But it actually  Is an American invention  Wow  I did not know that  That would be a good movie  Yeah  Boy  The church comes up  With some weird things  To do every so often  Don't they  They sure do  Yeah  Put a stake in them  And everything will be cool  Yeah  That'll work 
[02:41:00]  Oh yeah  Yeah  It gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Coming up  Must hear moments  For the past 12 months  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Continues  Worst of 2012  For the Opie and Anthony  Radio Program  My name is Iraq  In this segment here  We had a bunch of UFC guys  Come in since January 
[02:41:30]  John Jones  Rashad Evans  Uriah Faber  And as in typical  Jim Norton fashion  Every time a UFC guy  Is in studio  We end the interview  With some kind of move  Grip  Punch  Kick  Slap  Choke  Eyeball gouge  Something like that  Has to end the interview  And we do so here  This is a montage  First up will be  John Jones  Followed by  Rashad Evans  And then Uriah Faber  All beating the crap  Out of little  Jimmy Norton 
[02:42:00]  Here it is  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Let's say hi to  John Jones  Of course  From the UFC  What kind of choke  Are you going to do  Let's see here  I can give you  The machita choke  Give me the machita choke  Is that the one  You almost killed him with  I can almost kill him  Alright fair enough  Alright  So  What's the other  What's the other move too  Because people have asked me  Different ones  You want a different choke 
[02:42:30]  Or what  Yeah  What are you doing  With that microphone  Why is you just waving it  In a circle  Yes I am  Casting a spell on us  Let's see here  There's all types of chokes  You got your  Rear naked choke  Rear naked  Have I done that  No  You've done a rear naked  Yeah  I'll take the machita choke  Machita choke  Yeah  One machita choke  Coming up  By the way  I shouldn't have  Ordered it so casually  Because I've seen it  It's a fucking horrifying thing  I'll take a number two please  I'll tack very quickly  On this one  Alright  Can you do it  A lot of times  The guy's going really quick 
[02:43:00]  And I tap it  Could you go  A teeny bit slower  I'll ease it on you  Yeah  Is there  Some type of form  You could sign  Just in case I hurt  Socially injury  No please don't  Alright so big part of this move  It's like you need a wall  You need something behind the back  It's like one of the choking points  Oh here I go  What do you need me  Bobby will be the wall  Oh yeah  Or the door  Yeah the door  The wall  It doesn't matter  Why do we need the wall  I don't like this  Because it creates the pressure  Oh good  I was going to ask John to sign 
[02:43:30]  Before I was paralyzed  Turn off those TVs  You let me choke you  I'll sign the blows  Oh look at that  See what they do  Alright  Here we go  Alright so  He's got me  John's standing in front of me  And he's dipping my head down  Like to his midsection  And he has one very large  Strong hand under my neck  And one very large  Strong hand on top of my head  Hang on let me get my zipper down  I'm ready to offer him my desserts 
[02:44:00]  Alright you ready  Okay yeah  Alright here we go  How was that Jimmy  Wow  But he did it really slow  Thank you  He did it really slow  And for a second I was like  Oh I can hang with this  You should have kept it going  I should have  No I would have passed out  And then he went  Wow  He makes those sounds like  A fucking beaver that's in danger  Oh man no 
[02:44:30]  That was fucking brutal  But that's why I wanted to feel it slow  And you feel that pressure  And then it gets to a point  It creeps up on you quick  But it's once  It's at that point  Which is probably about a second into it  You're finished  And if you had just gone full strength  You wouldn't have taken that one  Can you do a rear naked on me  I've never had a rear naked  Oh absolutely  Here we go  Can you get your arms around  What are we doing here  A rear naked  Be ready to tap  Okay  Are we ready to tap really  A rear naked  I'm going to take my gum off  I'm going to spit it on John 
[02:45:00]  I'm going to get mad  After you  Hang on  Hang on  Go ahead  Let's go  Go  Oh  Oh Jesus  Oh Bobby's down  He's not out  Get out of here  You're right Bobby  You're right Bobby  You're right  I did feel his neck popping a little bit  John  John Jones is sick  Oh I love it  Did you feel the crack  He cracked something  Was he tapping  I didn't know  He was tapping  I don't know if he was tapping 
[02:45:30]  His neck was popping  Did you hear the crack  Oh yeah  You need to go see your chiropractor  Something went  He adjusted  Hey don't send me the chiropractor  Oh shit  You alright  Oh  Wow that was fucking  That's disturbing  You're helpless  Let me tell you what happens  You fucking forget what to do  Really  Or you guys don't know what to do  Oh I do  Tap  It squeezes  And then I heard a crack  And I was like what's that  And then I felt the lights going out 
[02:46:00]  And I go  Tap Bobby  Tap  The lights  The lights are going out  I started tapping  Well he was tapping  Oh  The lights are going out though  Yeah  It starts  It just starts going like this  And your mouth starts  But the thing is  You kept your arms by your fucking waist  Like a dumbbell  I start with my hands up  In tap position  You're fucking  You're Kenny casual  Just relax  Hey  Maybe I'll peruse a magazine  While he's choking me  My hands should be there man  I haven't  I  Well I'm not a professional  Choker  Tapper 
[02:46:30]  You mean  But what's important  Because it's radio  The video will show  That John Jones is like  Fuck you tapping  I'm going to have a little fun  Oh it'll be up  Trust me it will  The last one did amazing  The last one went everywhere  Yeah that Bobby one  Is going to be really  Fucking funny  Because you're tapping like a motherfucking  John knows  Yeah I'm like  Fuck that  You hurt  You felt  At first I didn't know  That was your neck  Popper or what  My neck actually feels better  He rocks panicking  That he's got to go  They're getting rambunctious  Yeah you got other shows to do I guess 
[02:47:00]  Can we ask you to sign our glove  Uh no  We'll take a break  Listen  We love when you come in here  I mean  I want to take a real light punch  I don't want to take a hard one though  Take it  Just take the punch  Hold on hold on  Wait wait wait  No  Hold on hold on  No  Hold on  Just a light one  Just a light one  Wait  Oh  Hold on  That's going to fucking bruise  It's not going to bruise  It's not going to bruise  He's the light heavyweight champion  Stupid  Of course it's going to bruise  Don't try to psych  It didn't happen 
[02:47:30]  Let's do this  It didn't happen  If you don't do it on video  I can't fucking  All right  A punch from John Jones  That was a hard one  Thank God I'm a righty  Holy shit  That's why I get in the left arm  No, I'm a righty  My right arm is good  Man, he aimed that one too  Like, let me get right  Bam  What does that look like?  I'll tell you what it feels like  It feels like a cartoon 
[02:48:00]  Oh, is it throbbing?  The left one  Let me see  Let me see  Oh, God  You're already bruised  Oh, it's starting already  You see me pull away like a girl  I can see like a fish print  Just starting to  Wow, that  He is  Oh, man  Let me tell you something  That is some fucking  He's a goddamn man  You want it again?  I don't want to get hit again  I can't take it again  Holy shit  It's bruising me  Yeah, that's great  What percent was that? 
[02:48:30]  That was about a 70  Oh, man  It was about a 70  Wow  What did that feel like hitting?  Like a bag of pudding?  Like a rice  Really compact  Rice pudding  Rice pudding  But he hit me  A bag of maggots  Jesus, that would get so humiliating  A bag of rice was nice  But maggots imply worriness  He choked my fat body up  And let me fall to the floor gently  That was a good shot  In the left arm  But I tightened up  Just so it wouldn't just hit the bone 
[02:49:00]  That was fucking a good shot  Wow  He really hit you  Yeah  I'm glad you did  I wouldn't say I liked it  But uh  That was solid  That's what that was  We fucking love John Jones  Love John Jones, man  Alright, this is just getting weird  This is O&H's worst of 2012  On the Opie and Anthony channel  Let's do this  Rashad Evans, man  Wow  What do you think  What I normally do  When the fighters come in  And I've done it with a lot of fighters  Where they've done it  Is I  Because I really am in awe  Of watching UFC  Is  They'll put me in some kind of a move 
[02:49:30]  Very quickly  And it's very  I tap immediately  It's not a test of two men  It's like  You know  One little fella  Seeing what a real fighter does  And we've had everyone  Brock has done it  And Fedor put me in an arm lock  And you know  So if you would put me in one  But again  I will tap quickly  And something that's easy  But I've had a bunch done  I've had  Brock put me in a knee  I think what's it called  A knee bar  A knee bar  And yeah  Okay  Which is very unpleasant  And they give like  You know  A small percentage of power  Well  And Jim's like 
[02:50:00]  Ah  Oh yeah  And McCain  Guillotine choked me  And Couture  Rear naked choked me  I mean  I've had a few really  Oh yeah  But just for that half a second  Or that second to feel that  It's like  How does anybody  Sign up for this  Well a lot of people  Suggesting stuff Jimmy  What kind of moves  Do they suggest  A triangle choke  Can I suggest one  Oh yeah sure  This one would be  Easy enough for both of you  They're all going to be easy  For him  Well  This one would be easy  For you  Arm triangle  I was just thinking 
[02:50:30]  The same thing  There you go  Arm triangle  Arm triangle  It's a good one  It's a good one  Arm triangle  Now  Make him hear the  Fluorescent lights buzz  Which  I'll do it on  I'll do it on the side  You'll do it on my right side  Just don't hurt the right arm  Believe me  That's the critical one  And  So I'll have my left hand  To tap  You can bet I will  It won't hurt too bad  Okay  All right  Hold on  Let me tell him  Now what he's doing right now  Is he's got his arm  Around my neck  And he's got his  Head outside of my arm  So it's like a triangle 
[02:51:00]  My right arm and neck  Are being held  By his right arm  And he's not hurting me  But he certainly could  Okay  So now I'm in the arm triangle  So  The noises you make  We need a montage  Of those noises  Oh  We're gonna have one  That  It starts off  Like  It doesn't  It's  It was like 
[02:51:30]  Oh this isn't that bad  And then the pressure comes  And I didn't know  The other hand  Came around  It kind of pushed  Your head sideways  Dude your fucking head  Is being mushed  My head like a tomato  Where does it hurt  In the neck  It's not even  Necessarily a hurt  It's just  Everything you know  In the world  Is going away immediately  You heard the sound  He made  It feels like that sound  That's what it's like  To have a boa constrictor  On you  Like that  That's like  You're being squeezed  There's nothing 
[02:52:00]  You're gonna do  Do you want me  Give you a picture of that  Great picture  Look at his face  Oh my god  That face says it all man  But look  The beautiful thing is  You can see my face  It's from the back angle  You see Rashad's hand  About to hit my head  I'm not even  Getting the hand on the head  Not the full effect  Wow that is fucking powerful  You got the sound  Travis  Let's hear that  Okay so now  I'm in the arm triangle  So  Jimmy my camera wasn't on 
[02:52:30]  Can you do that again  Those are the sounds  Of victory  Can you take one more  My camera wasn't on  I'll take another one  Will you do another one  That's a tough one  Sure but you realize  How easily these guys  It's like  Anyone who doesn't  Like this sport  It's fucking  So impressive to me  That knowing that  Can happen  That somebody shows up  Like immediately  If someone did that  To me in training  I would find a way  To get out of the fight  I'd be like  Look I can't do it  I can't do this  Yeah I gotta go  Somewhere  I wanna get a nice 
[02:53:00]  Close up  So one more time  Or what's another  One you wanna do  Well you already  Had everything else  I mean everything else  We have to get on the ground  And do so  I would try something  On the ground  I've never had  Something that's  Cause I know you have  The fight coming up  So I don't want you  To exert anything  But  How phony am I  Yeah you're really  Gonna hurt  How phony am I  Like you know  I know you have a fight  Coming up  So now you don't wanna  Fucking take this snail  And twist it up  Your fluff and utter body  I know how easy  Was it just to sink  Even my head is soft  Yeah fucking  I have a baby skull  So what is  I've never done one 
[02:53:30]  On the  Even when  BJ Penn arm barred me  In the seat  And when Brock  Did the knee bar  It was in the chair  What is one on the ground  That's not  You ever have a triangle  I have not  No is that  Is that the one  That Verdum  Beat Fedor with  Yes  That is it  Okay  Because Verdum  Was on the ground  And Fedor  Started punching  And he was set up  He was set up  Wow  And that's when  Your whole body  Is kind of locked up  Like that  It's kind of  The same position  But just with the  With the legs  I would like to try that  Because it tapped 
[02:54:00]  They were tapped  That tapped  It's like we're at a restaurant  And he wants to try  Everything on the menu  I would like to try that  Well you know what  Fans never get a chance  To do this  Fans watch this stuff  And they never get a chance  To do this stuff  To see what it's like  To have a fucking  Champion fighter  Put you in a hold like this  And know you  I don't have to do it  In a bar  And with a regular guy  A regular guy  Right  This is another  Fan experience  Because you're not  Doing it in a way  Like those  There's a couple of guys  In a fucking restaurant  Somewhere that know  What it's like  To be knocked out by him 
[02:54:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Sure do  I don't have to deal  With that  So that's why  Is that okay  I would like to try that  Oh I'd like to see this  So what's this now  Now I have to get  A mic down here  It's a triangle  Mars you got the  Is that mic on  I don't know if I got that one  On the leg  Set  You got this one  He's on seven  Set  Okay now  On the leg  Come inside of my guard  I'm inside  I have to walk closer  Yeah  On my knees  On your knees  He's lying on his back  Now  Alright  Now he's got him  In like scissors 
[02:55:00]  Or what you would call it  So the lock  Now the lock's  Coming around  Jim's neck  Yeah he's got everything  All tied up  And now he's got him  In a triangle  Around his neck  And now he's going to  Apply some pressure  Oh  Jimmy's face  Is completely red  He applied pressure  He pretty much  Had him in a  How was that  In a leg lock  Around your neck  I didn't know  See that  But now I know  How that works  Like  I didn't realize  The hips got pushed forward 
[02:55:30]  And applied so much  More pressure  Yeah  Because you think  That's all the pressure  You're going to get  And then he pushed  His hips forward  And it's lights out  Literally  You would have just been gone  A couple of seconds  More of that  And I'm out  This is O&H  Worst of 2012  On the Opie and Anthony channel  What's up Uriah  What's up guys  How are you doing man  How are you  I'm good  How are you guys doing  Really good  Good  But I would like to take  I took the last time  We had  I've gotten punched  A couple of times  But only in the arm  And believe me  With Frankie Edgar  And Rashad 
[02:56:00]  And who  Jones  Oh boy did Jones  Put a fucking  On me  But he likes it  He's like  He's a nice guy  But he's just sadistic  Yeah he's a little bit sadistic  Yeah there's a reason  He's the champion  Like you can see  How can you be such a nice guy  And fight  And then he fucking  Puts you in a necklock  He's like  Oh this little guy  Is going to let me  Kick him  Here it goes  Yeah  And he goes  I should have  Kicked you harder  I'm like  That's a good point  And he holds it  A little longer  After you tap too  A little longer  He's the one guy  That holds it  A little longer  Would you hit me  Not as hard as you can  But in the right arm  But let me just  Tighten up a little bit  Hold on 
[02:56:30]  Here's what's upsetting  I said  Would you  Before I got the sentence out  His fist is clenched  He was making a fist  Like yeah I could do this  I fucking hate  When these guys  Are in fight mode  Like when they have  A fight coming up  Like you want to get them  After a fight  When they're bruised  And relaxed  And feeling peaceful  But alright  Yeah just not  Okay  Not as hard  Oh no  I'm not going to do this hard  Jimmy move me around  I get it  Yeah sure  Why do you need to see me  Falling off the chair  Hell yeah  Maybe I should elbow him instead  Save my hand  Save my hand  Oh you believe me  You're not hitting a hard target  With my fucking arm 
[02:57:00]  I'm making a muscle  It's looking like  Hitting a fucking  I'm not going to do this hard  Okay thank you  Ready  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  I actually physically jumped  An elbow would be too hard  I think to take  Elbow  No  Yeah don't do an elbow actually  No  I don't want to hit you  No I don't mind though  It's in the spirit of  Just as long as you're not  Beating off while I do this  Yeah right  He's got a big fucking heart on  He's got a Cialis rod

[02:58:30]  Yeah  That's fucking  Oh man  Wow  That sounded like a fight  But when you watch these things  And I've said this every time I've done it  It's a new respect  Because you understand something  Even on a minor level  Yeah  Like he was being friendly  And hitting me in the arm  Not as hard as he could of course  How many percent there  Or whatever  Oh man  That's gonna bruise nice  Jimmy let me see  Pull it up  That was 60-70 I'm thinking  It's already  Already started changing color  Yeah  How hard was that  Oh my  I don't know 
[02:59:00]  Not that hard  50  It wasn't  Yeah probably 50%  And that was in the  And I tightened up the arm  That's gonna bruise  I'm lovely  You gotta tweet a picture of the bruise  Oh I will  I do  Every time  He rocks got the sound  I want to hear this again  Okay  Oh fuck the headphones  No don't cock  Alright  Here we go  Oh  It's that  It's like a pop almost  That sounded like the love scene  In Raging Bull  That really fucking hurt  That was a 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  But again  To fucking  To know you're gonna get in  And take that  On the fucking jaw  Oh please  Imagine that to your face  No  I'm amazed  If anybody can take that  I don't know if we're allowed to do this  But there is a marine out there  That is a huge fan  That wanted to get hit  Oh I don't want to get  I don't want to hit him  He's a huge fan  I love marine  He's a civilian  I can't be hitting people  Yeah you don't get in trouble  I just suggested  Look at it  He's all excited  He's a big guy  He's like come on  Bring it  Next thing you know  Uriah's in court  Yeah right  He flashbacks to the war 
[03:00:00]  He's got  Oh man  It's already starting  Imagine getting that in the face  That's the amazing part of it  And then they keep fighting  I don't get it  They keep fucking  Once in a while they fall  But there are guys  That will take three rounds of that  And then eventually  You get them at one  But how do you take that  But what's that about  I don't get it  Isn't it crazy  You see with boxing also  You see all these  Big hits  Big hits  Big hits  And it's just a little  Tiny one on the chin  That puts a guy out  Yeah that will lay him out  It's crazy about  I mean that's why 
[03:00:30]  You got to aim  If you guys are ever  Going to get a street fight  Aim for the chin  Upper lip  Right here at the jaw  It puts guys out  That's where it is  You hit them hard  Yeah  You can just  It's amazing  Who can take the best punch  You've ever thrown  I'm sure you've hit guys  When you hit somebody  Hard  And you know you get them hard  And you get them right  Where you want them  And they come right back  It psychologically has to  Bother you on some level  Yeah a little bit  But you know  It just makes you  Want to hit them more  So it works out  That's the difference 
[03:01:00]  Between him and me  What is it about  What they call  The button  Getting hit on the jaw  Yeah on the chin  Right on the kisser  I think it has to do  With some wiring there  The connecting of the jaw  And like the  The shaking  Of everything  The rattle  Yeah  There's some nerves in there  You can take a good punch though  I mean  Oh yeah  There's certain like  This chin  This chin's famous  Yeah you got a chin  You got the chin  And the chin is made  For inviting  That chisel  That's right  It looks like  There's a picture of him  As a baby  And he's got it  It's two days old  With that chin  And he's already got the chin 
[03:01:30]  But you need that  Like these guys  Like when you see a lot of them  Like Velasquez  And a lot of these guys  Have like these fucking  Neanderthal ridge  Like they're built to take shots  Where you gotta have a jaw like that  Where like  Like a Chuck Liddell type jaw  Where you're just made  To take fucking punishment  I on the other hand  Do not have that gift  Or an arm  Let me see the arm again  It's okay for now  But I can feel it  That really hurts  Yeah that really hurts  But you know  It's a war wound  I'll lie about what happened  I'll be like  He fucking got in my  Oh yeah 
[03:02:00]  Yeah  It gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Twelve  Twelve  Twelve  Twelve  Twelve  Twelve  Conning  Genius  Right now  Worst of 2012  For the Opie and Anthony Show  My name is E-Rock  E-Rock Radio  On Twitter  And in this segment  Our old friend  Iced T  He wasn't really booked  For the show  We just saw him  hanging out in the hallway he was doing other interviews that day but he showed up really early

[03:16:30]  broccoli who was a wonderful man and a dear dear friend of mine and he had said something that  had upset cubby very much and i wanted to to clear it between them and i was living in california at the  time and had a dinner party and i invited cubby and i invited sean and sat them next together  and i the first part of the conversation i heard was cubby said sean did you really 
[03:17:00]  say if my brains were on fire you wouldn't piss in my ear to put it out  it's not true cubby said i'm pissing you any bloody time  oh yeah yeah it gets worse  more of opian anthony's worst of 2012  coming up 
[03:17:30]  yeah this is opian anthony's worst of 2012  worst of 2012 for the opian anthony show just like the sweeper just told you  my name is eric eric radio on twitter and in this segment we're featuring bill burr our good  friend bill burr at bill burr on twitter he's also the host of the monday morning podcast which  you can find on all things comedy.com and itunes and other places that you normally would get  podcasts anyway bill burr's in studio in this first segment sandra bullock he's doing a movie with 
[03:18:00]  sandra bullock and some of those gossip columns out there we're trying to link him with her did  something happen did something not happen no nothing happened and bill's here to set the record  straight i can't believe i use that cliche term bill burr here he is this is only it's worst of  2012 on the opian anthony channel i think we're all distracted because we we want to know about  the gossip that's going on bill bill let's tell you something you guys if that was even remotely 
[03:18:30]  true you don't think you would have known before that stupid thing wrote it i i don't know it's no i  one word of truth and i don't even think at that point she when that thing came out she even knew my name  but but apparently you guys are i had a part in the movie where i played uh melissa mccarthy's 
[03:19:00]  family yeah and there's like seven of us so we did one scene they both come in and there's all  seven of us you know doing whatever the hell we're supposed to do in the scene you know  you know it's like when you go to a party and you mean this is joey this is mike this is phyllis  you know yeah by the time you go around the room you don't remember anybody's name that's  basically where it was at but uh but sandra's friends are worried because you're a bad boy  uh yeah yeah no it said friends are fearful oh fearful right fearful i was reading it laughing 
[03:19:30]  my ass i was howling and and apparently uh wasn't there stuff going on like behind the scenes you  were throwing stuff at each other and making jokes i threw some doritos and then they threw apples at  me like full-on apple they came back a little more hardcore yeah yeah well that apparently is uh a  relationship in hollywood yeah no that never happened i threw doritos but bill stars of the  movie yeah yeah i was thinking  two lines in this movie i think i'll start putting post-its on people's backs 
[03:20:00]  yeah you put a it said you put a sign on her back yeah yeah i know yeah yeah well but but bill  that's still a good story though alien baby when all of that allegedly but bill how cool is it  yeah so it's some attention that's a great story hunky too that's pretty fucking good well it's  it says it says she's getting hot and heavy hot and heavy comedian bill burr with hunky comedian bill 
[03:20:30]  burr who wrote that story it was submitted by anonymous bill b it says it says sandy has a laugh  so hard or looks so good in years and it's all thanks to bill thanks to bill that's great they're  constantly joking and cutting up together sandy says they bonded so quickly because they're both  of german irish descent and they get each other's quirky sense of humor oh well you know the quirky 
[03:21:00]  sense of humor of the germans yeah listen my kraut mick friends yes yes oh she was she was seen  giggling happily as bill became red and enraged talking about the banking system and the fucking  oh now they have the apple store and the doritos thing in here they call you the three stooges because  uh oh you're all a riot together there's not an ounce of truth in it i don't know how many different 
[03:21:30]  oh i believe you i'm just i'm just now you're trying to eat up 20 minutes of radio  but that's why it's fun to read this it says here you were sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i  Is that true, Bill Burr?  You were giggling as you dropped Toomer's honey jars. 
[03:22:00]  Fucking A, Bill.  Oh, and the post-it said,  Kick me, I'm a stuck-up Hollywood bitch.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Bill, that's a little too far.  She found it hilarious and wore it all day long,  and yeah, that never happened.  Bill, I didn't...  It's not bad I want any of that to be true.  Right?  I didn't think for a moment it was true,  but it's great to see your pal, you know,  in the gossip pages.  Yeah, it really is cool.  And it also proves that all these fucking rags  are pretty much full of shit.  Yeah, when it comes to that. 
[03:22:30]  You know what's funny is they...  Some people go, like, you know,  it's either 100% false most of the time,  or they got it right.  Or it's completely true, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, they'll definitely be like,  yeah, this person's relationship is on the rocks,  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But, you know, nobody...  I don't know.  I have no...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is O&A's Worst of 2012  on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[03:23:00]  Continuing on with Bill Burr  for the Worst of 2012,  the Opie and Anthony show.  Bill talks about airport material.  It's not the typical cliche airport shit  that you hear from comedians  about the food  and the frequent flyer miles  and all that stuff.  He's talking about a serious concern to him,  probably to you,  when he deals with radiation  from the security systems  they have at airports.  Bill's not happy with it.  Here it is.  Hey, do I got time for one more wacky story?  Yes.  I'm in the airport,  and I always opt out  of going through that giant microwave,  you know,  where you got to stand, 
[03:23:30]  spread eagle.  We heard about that from DeRosa, yeah.  Yeah, everything but your taint, right?  You just stand there and get zapped.  Yeah.  So I don't, you know,  and I know people give me shit.  Yeah, you talk on your cell phone  when you're flying on the plane,  there's radiation,  and my whole thing is  I get that there's radiation in my life,  but if I can opt out of the extra  and supersized radiation,  I'm going to do it.  So everybody thinks I'm an idiot,  saying it's not that bad,  you're a moron,  it takes you an extra 15 minutes  to get through security.  So I'm in Logan Airport, 
[03:24:00]  and I'm standing there,  the usual,  trying to keep an eye on my wallet  as I wait for the people  to passively, aggressively  finally come and pat me down, right?  Yeah.  I see that the security lady  sees this kid comes walking up,  and she goes,  how old are you?  And he goes, 13.  And she goes,  come this way,  and she had him just walk  through the metal detector.  So I'm standing there going,  so I'm supposed to go into something  that could kill a 13-year-old  and just stand there,  spread eagle.  Oh, fuck, what a good point.  Well, they don't want his nuts  getting irradiated at that age, 
[03:24:30]  I guess, huh?  Well, evidently,  it's okay to irradiate my nuts.  Yeah, yeah.  There's enough radiation  to prevent me from going through puberty  had I been going through that.  Right.  Right, and I guess they've...  Wow, what is that about?  I guess they figure he's young,  so he's got a lot more  of a life of absorbing radiation  than, you know,  old Bill Burr,  who's halfway through his life,  and...  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That is fucked up.  But is it for that reason, though?  I don't know.  I feel vindicated. 
[03:25:00]  I think you're right.  Hold on.  Could it just be that  they make random pics  who they think are less security risks  and just put them  through the less secure metal detector?  No, they put them  through the old school one.  The regular old metal detector.  Well, that's what I mean.  Yeah, they put them through that  instead of the...  If they, like,  there's certain people  they might deem  less of a security risk,  so they just will occasionally  pull people out  and put them through  the metal detector  as opposed to the x-ray.  I haven't seen that done.  There was no line.  There was no delay.  I'm telling you.  Oh, okay.  Jim, listen.  I used to work  in a dental office. 
[03:25:30]  We used to take  an x-ray of one tooth.  We put the camera...  The camera...  The radiation was just right  where your cheek is.  It's right up against your face.  We put a lead vest  over all your vitals  right over your crotch,  and then I left the room,  stood behind a wall  that had lead in it,  and I pressed the button.  Just take a picture  of your incisor.  I actually think  that by opting out  where they have me standing 
[03:26:00]  is so close to the thing,  I'm getting more radiation  than if I went through it.  So I always try  to be out or away from it.  And they go,  sir, stand right there.  It's like,  I'm not standing next  to that fucking thing,  and you're going to be dead  in like six years.  Yeah, because you're  close enough to it,  and it takes longer,  so you're there  for like three people  going through it.  Yeah, so I always  walk over to the other side,  and they say,  sir, don't stand there.  I go, I'm keeping an eye  in my wallet.  And then they go,  okay, just stand right there.  Ugh. 
[03:26:30]  Wow.  Good fucking point, man.  Wow, man.  Stand in there,  spread eagle.  Even your armpits  are getting hit.  I'm telling you.  Let me get all those  lymph nodes.  You got them?  Oh, shit.  They don't have that  fucking figured out.  They don't know for sure, right?  No, they don't.  Hell no.  The first iPhone  comes out,  sucks,  and then they figure it out  three months later.  That's a new radiation machine.  I'm not going in that thing.  You don't fuck yourself.  I got it.  I'm with Bill on this one.  All right.  Well, there you go. 
[03:27:00]  I've whored myself out.  Good job.  I told my investigative  reporter story  about the airport.  He just wanted  to be vindicated.  Right.  And I squashed rumors.  You squashed a rumor.  Squashed rumors.  Because I don't think  Bill Burr has talked  about that yet.  Oh, boy.  This is ONH's  worst of 2012.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Worst of 2012  Opie and Anthony show  continuing on with Bill Burr.  He's in studio  and time to time  when Bill's not  going off on sports  or the Illuminati  or conspiracies 
[03:27:30]  or something  that's making him angry,  sometimes he sits back  and relax with the rest of us  and goof on stupid shit.  Like in this segment,  we talk about Lucille Ball  and Jimmy Durante  with our pal,  Bill Burr.  Who was that?  Oh, Durante.  Oh, he was the worst.  A-dink-a-dink-a-doo.  I fucking detest Jimmy Durante.  Can we play him again?  I'd rather not.  I love when we play  Jimmy Durante.  He stunk.  They're not Durante.  This guy is fucking famous, too.  I like the subtleties  of his performance.  That's Mike Grover. 
[03:28:00]  Subtlety of his performance.  Oh, Bill, he wasn't subtle.  Here's Jimmy Durante.  Make someone happy.  Wait, this doesn't look  like Jimmy Durante.  Jimmy Durante is from 1988, Sam.  The killers.  The killers.  For me, he's the original Tom Waits.  Really?  Yeah.  Same hat.  Okay.  Oof.  It's so important  to make someone happy.  Isn't this here  in a commercial, man?  I like this guy.  It's this version.  He looks like a vegetarian. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, he really does.  Yeah, make someone happy.  I was worried  this was going to be  overproduced.  Yeah, right?  Jesus Christ.  Just burying his awful voice.  Who enjoyed this?  I don't know.  They, uh, yeah.  Hey, you know what else  is great?  They looked at his  bloated alcohol nose  like it was endearing.  Yeah.  It's big. 
[03:29:00]  Ah, the schnozzola.  It's ravaged by alcohol.  Make one person happy  like my drinking buddy Bing  when he smashes his daughter  in the forehead  with a bottle.  This is a big hit, I guess, for him.  You don't like this one?  No, I want the one  that was comedically.  A Dink-A-Doo.  Oh, this is the one we hate.  Look at his face.  What's he doing? 
[03:29:30]  He said, kid,  you got a face for radio.  Dink.  His arms would be out like this.  Come on, go.  Go.  Oh, yeah.  It's called  A Dink-A-Dink-A-Dude.  Dink-A-Dink-A-Dude.  You know.  Mine's different, dude.  Dude.  How do you like those guys?  Everybody puts in extra notes.  I'll overlook it.  But the two for you.  Oh, my God.  Shit.  When do you talk  and when do you sing?  A Dink-A-Dink-A-Dude.  Oh, again. 
[03:30:00]  A Dink-A-Dink-A-Dude.  A Dink-A-Dude.  Oh, one or two.  This makes my spine hurt.  I don't mind him.  It's the background singer.  It really is annoying, right?  D'Andrew Sussis.  What is that?  It's not the whole world.  It just reminds me  like that fucking  Hitler's right around the corner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What could go wrong?  Yeah.  Everything is sunny.  Baby, I fucking love you.  And then fucking...  Desi Arnaz and Jimmy Durante 
[03:30:30]  in fucking color?  Everybody wants to get in.  What?  What does that mean?  He doesn't have  a gin blossom nose, dude.  He just has a giant fucking nose.  Really?  I thought he had like...  Hey, someone get the PR  off the drums.  He's a vocalist.  Oh, boy.  Hello, Kate.  Hello, Desi Arnaz.  I love when he stands up  and says his real name  like nobody knows who it is. 
[03:31:00]  Why, sure.  Say, where are you going  with that Cuban wastebasket?  I'm going to cheat  on my wife again.  Cuban wastebasket.  It's his wife.  Where are you going  with that Cuban cum dumpster?  Does the carpet match  the drapes?  Ah, cha-cha-cha.  Great dream.  You ever pull a train  with Bill Frawley?  That's a challenge.  You ever eat  Vivian Vance's asshole  after?  I'm not fluent, Jimmy.  I just had a 
[03:31:30]  very bad head cold.  Well,  it was too close  to my nose.  You know,  you could wipe out  an illustrious  career.  What is he doing?  He's tripping.  An illustrious  career.  How long  did the  canned laughter  guy have to wait  to push the button  before we get  that punchline?  Or you ain't.  You know something?  I'll make a deal  with you.  And he'd look  at the audience  like,  what's this guy  saying?  I'll learn you  English.  If you learn 
[03:32:00]  me Spanish,  that ought to be  something.  All right.  But let me ask you  something.  Oh,  Ricky,  let me in.  That's when Lucy's  voice was gone  at that point.  Ah,  Ricky.  Did anybody get  older quicker  than Lucille?  The difference  between her  talking to  Desi and  Mr. Mooney?  The original  Tara Reid  we used to do.  Yeah, 
[03:32:30]  yeah.  Oh,  my God.  Oh,  my God.  I can't believe  I'm in Europe.  Everybody,  make sure you  see the new  American Pie movie.  It's fantastic.  She blew us off.  Yeah.  Lucy on Joan Rivers.  That was probably  a good move for her.  Yeah,  probably.  Kennedy Center  tribute.  You're right.  And she's back  on TV,  Aren't We Lucky?  What year is this?  Life with Lucy,  the living legend  herself.  She died in like  88,  maybe 89.  Just riddled  with cancer  from all those  Philip Morris cigarettes.  Yeah,  she was eating them  with fucking pudding. 
[03:33:00]  That would have been  a good picture,  right, Jim?  Lucille Ball.  Yeah.  That's a big one.  They all worshipped her.  Yeah.  Carol Burnett  and Joan.  They're all dressed  like E-Rod.  Studio audience.  Lucille Ball.  Seems pretty healthy.  Well, Joan.  We might have to  find a clip  from 88.  How nice.  Look at her  tobacco voice.  They used to smoke 
[03:33:30]  unfiltered cigarettes  and have that  aluminum foil  suntan.  Now then.  About your  sex life.  Lucille.  You know what it is  to follow Nancy Reagan?  Yes.  No one can do it  but you.  No one can do it.  And then they got  Joan Rivers  pre-fucking  pre-corrected surgery  there.  That was while  Carson was looking  at her picture 
[03:34:00]  yelling,  you cunt!  That was around that  time period.  Yes.  How dare you.  What a cunt.  Yes, I hope  Edgar kills himself.  Oh shit.  How powerful  was he that you  had to ask his  permission  to do a talk show?  Can I do a show  if you didn't?  Can I have my dream  come true?  God forbid.  Someone goes  for their dream,  Johnny.  Would that be okay  if I try to get  my piece of the pie?  Especially since  they weren't  going to offer 
[03:34:30]  her the show.  Of course.  And she knew  she was not  in the running  for permanent hosts.  She had every right  to try.  I think they said  he was mad  because she didn't  call and go,  hey, I got a show.  She probably was  scared shitless  of the guy.  That's how that works.  He was a crybaby.  He was a rough one, yeah.  Let other people  have some competition.  And he hated women,  I think, too,  because his mother  was just such a gunt.  He was a guy  who didn't want you  to have a show.  Tommy from Brooklyn.  You used to have  to call him. 
[03:35:00]  You'd call him  day or night.  You'd have to  fucking talking  and singing.  That.  Oh, no, I hate it.  And I would, too.  I'd call him,  but not till  one in the morning.  And when you  called him.  And you're  when you  called him.  Stupid background  singing.  Your husband  feels so guilty  that he  offs himself.  He drank  and took  some pills.  But you pick  yourself up 
[03:35:30]  and you keep  on going.  It always comes  around positive.  Of course.  You'll never  get that death  face  out of your mind.  Tommy  at Brooklyn  says,  Durrani  sounds like  Ira,  our pal  Ira.  No.  You don't  think so?  A dink,  a dink,  a do.  When you're  smiling,  the whole world  smiles with you. 
[03:36:00]  You want  some gossip  on Lucille Ball?  Yeah.  I've been waiting  for this call  for many years.  Oh, yeah.  Andy in Cleveland.  What's up, Andy?  Hey, guys.  I grew up in  Jamestown, New York,  just out of Buffalo  and Lucille Ball  was her hometown.  And right about  the late 90s,  they really started  going all in  with the Lucille Ball  thing as their  way to bring up  the town's income  on their old hero.  And they had  to be very careful 
[03:36:30]  about who they  interviewed about  her previous life  when she lived  in Jamestown  because anybody  who went to  high school with  her about the  same time she  left for Hollywood  will tell you  that she fucked  her way out  of town.  Oh, yeah?  It was a huge way.  Lucille Ball  was a slut.  It had nothing  to do with  her talent.  That big  fucking red bush.  Yeah.  Did she have  a bozo bush?  Maybe that's how  she learned  how to make  all her funny faces.  She was probably  awful in the sack.  That's why  Ricky was fucking  everybody.  Ricky was fucking  everyone he worked  with.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  I had lunch  when I did the burn.  I love this gossip  from 1950.  I just love  New Details  show.  Yes.  Brand new.  Jeff lost his  show tapes  right next door  to where  I Love Lucy  was taped.  Oh, really?  So the lunch  was at Hollywood  Center Studios  which is where  Lucky Louis was  taped.  They do a lot  of shit there.  Why sure, Fred?  Yeah, but you  could see the  steps going to  the dressing rooms  and there's  pictures of  fucking Desi  and Lucy  and you could  just see that's  where he would  go up and  probably fuck  these girls.  You want to  give the tour,  Jimmy?  Somebody told me 
[03:37:30]  that Lucy had  people watching  to see who  went up to  see him  because she  was so  fuck.  Imagine your  own show  and all you  think of  is your  husband's  going to  be fucking  somebody up  there.  Fucking some  broad while  you're  trying to do  a scene.  Lucy, I  have to  rehearse.  I have to  work the  lines over  with her.  Come on.  I'm not  fucking Lucy.  Why are you  taking women  up there,  Ricky?  Don't throw  them up here.  You have  gramps on  your feet.  You're unsexy  cunt.  You would be  a good tour 
[03:38:00]  guide.  Ladies and  gentlemen, keep  up, keep  up.  If you  look up  here, you'll  see where  Denzi used  to rail  bitches in  the ass  while Lucy  was trying  to do a  scene.  And this  red fleck  here is  actually a  piece of  blood after  she hit him  with a  stapler when  she walked  in and  caught him  receiving a  handjob.  This is  O&H Worst  of 2012  on the  Opian  Anthony  channel.  Continuing  with Bill  Burr, Worst  of 2012  Opian  Anthony  show.  Well, we 
[03:38:30]  had to dip  into a little  bit of Bill's  conspiracy theory  stuff when we  talk about the  president and  the planet.  I'll just leave  it at that.  Bill Burr, at  Bill Burr on  Twitter, host of  the Monday  Morning Podcast.  I want to know  why the president  gets paid like the  same as like an  NBA ref.  I mean, talk about  just opening up a  guy to sit there  and get yelled  at by the whole  world, no matter  what you do, and  you make it like,  what's he make,  three, four hundred  grand a year?  If you offer...  This guy's running  websites making more  than the president.  It's just not 
[03:39:00]  right.  If you raise that  salary to a million,  right off the bat,  you're going to get  better fucking  qualified people going  for it.  You make a guy  less susceptible to  being bribed, I  would think.  Although a lot of  those guys who run  us are already  million...  Yeah, they're all  millionaires.  You're already a  millionaire.  So other than the  ego trip of like,  I don't want to sit  in traffic for the  next four to eight  years, like why  else would you...  Is that a direct  pay, you think, or  does he have to go  to the bank and  cash his presidential  paycheck?  Well, yeah, and I  think food is free  too, so that $400  goes a lot far. 
[03:39:30]  That's like $600  grand to the regular  price.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And rent is free.  Let's not forget  the rent.  Yeah.  Free travel.  No mortgage.  Travel.  Free clothes.  Guy doesn't pay  That is the worst  fucking job you  could ever have.  And then you live  in the White House  and every time you  look out the window  as you just made  another decision  where they're going  to be dropping  bombs, you look  out and there's  like 400 tourists  sitting there with  their picture.  I don't ever want  to be flanked  because they know  someone's going to  maybe try to blow  my head off.  That's a $400  grand a year.  It doesn't make  any fucking sense. 
[03:40:00]  Who really would  want that?  Why would you do  that?  You're right.  Because then you do  the college gigs at  the end where you  make like a million  bucks a night.  That's your golden  parachute.  Once you lose  the fucking gig  then you can make  some money.  Right.  Yeah.  No, no, you're  setting yourself up  while you're in  office.  Yeah, yeah.  Setting up all  your buddies.  It's like going  to college and  then landing the  big job.  Yeah.  Then you buy a  bunch of land  down in South  America that sits  on aquifers.  What's that?  What's that?  I really don't know.  What is that?  It has to do with  there's only so much  chicken and fresh 
[03:40:30]  water.  Yeah.  You know, and  everybody just keeps  banging.  It's going to hit a  finite thing and at  some point fresh  water is going to be  people going to be  coming at you like  zombies.  You're going to be  holding gold.  This right here,  dude, this is the  next gold bar right  here.  Fresh water.  You think so?  I mean, it's so  easy to distill an  ocean and we have  like a fucking  lot of...  Yeah, and you know  something?  Nature doesn't need  that ocean.  We should drink it  dry.  There's no way  that could ever  happen.  I don't think we're  having any effect  whatsoever on the  planet. 
[03:41:00]  Whatsoever.  No, no.  You can't get rid  of the water.  You can't get rid of  it.  Even if you're using  it, it eventually  finds its way back  into the ocean.  75% of the world.  You could take that,  distill it, and drink  it, and have fresh  water.  This man's amazing.  He goes from  architectural...  Right now he's in  the sea.  You are the one to...  He's like all the  super friends combined.  How do you know that  it hurts the sea?  The same way you can't  have the deer population  get out of control  because it affects us.  This is the thing.  If any species goes 
[03:41:30]  over the balance it's  supposed to be, it has  some sort of effect.  I'm not saying  we're the reason the  polar ice caps are  melting.  I know, but you  have a fucking effect.  I think you're right,  but the water thing  has nothing to do  with it.  I don't like the  idea that a planet  is populated with a  bunch of fucking  filthy animals.  I used to do a bit  how, you know,  deers don't drive  SUVs.  You know what I  mean?  We're way overpopulated  and we're doing all  that other shit,  nuclear waste,  plastics that don't  even, that don't  biodegrade ever.  Good shit.  But we're saying  that the deer... 
[03:42:00]  You're just sticking  it in the ground  and shit, and it's  just like...  But Bill, we're  saying the deer are  the problem.  That's what's  hilarious.  Yeah, the deer are  the problem.  There should be  a hunting season  on humans.  Because the deer's  going to, you know,  curb us down.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it has to happen.  Because it's a hassle  to hit one of them  every once in a while.  We've got to calm  down the deer  population.  It is ridiculous  when you think about it.  We'll never run  out of water.  Never.  That's the thing.  You make me feel  so much comfortable.  The morning shock  job is telling me  about the water supply.  I love how you  discount me on 
[03:42:30]  everything I say.  Because I'm a  fucking moron, too.  Okay?  75% of the planet  has water on it.  It's the definitive way.  Yeah.  We're going to be okay.  But it's like saying  the sun isn't going  to burn out today.  You'll be like,  well, get out.  Jesus Christ,  it could burn out.  It could.  It could burn out.  All right, it could.  But odds are,  it's not going to.  You see what he does?  No, what did I do?  You just made a fucking  halfway decent speculation  into something 
[03:43:00]  absolutely ridiculous.  We have a planet  full of water.  There's more water  than land.  And the moon's made out  of cheese.  I can do it, too.  There's a lot more water  on this planet  than there ever was  fossil fuel,  and we're still using that.  Anthony, you are just as  dumb as I am.  Shut your face.  I don't want to hear  your stupid theories.  I'm arguing your dumb  argument with my dumb  argument, then.  I will say, though,  we're going to drink up  the ocean is a hard  one to sell.  Exactly.  I think the ocean  will make it.  I don't literally mean that.  I don't literally mean that.  I think we're going to be okay.  Okay, well, you know,  there's fish actually  getting skin cancer 
[03:43:30]  at this point.  They should go deeper.  They're fucking tanning.  Exactly.  You've got the whole ocean  to fucking move.  Get deeper.  Yeah, dumb fish.  They're fucking tanning themselves.  It's because they're fucking  sitting next to your rollerblades  that you threw out  nine years ago.  No better.  If you see a big tank  with a skull on it,  don't swim up  and fucking nibble at it.  Buzz off.  Yeah, they're not tied  down to a job.  They can move.  They can move  to wherever they want.  Exactly.  No one's making the fish  stay.  There's no zoning  right?  You don't have to worry  about a mortgage.  Just to us.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Let's play the rest  of the Jesse clip,  please.  They're half hour,  yet they were doing  a pre-broadcast  back to England  that, yes,  it's true,  that this building  fell  and it hadn't fallen yet.  If you're trying  to make out  the British Broadcasting Company,  one of the most  respected news organizations  in the world,  was inventing  huge buildings  falling over,  you need to have a break,  Jesse.  Thank you,  Piers.  We're talking about  Israel.  No, he's not kidding you.  They fucked up that day. 
[03:44:30]  Period.  Well, they said the wrong,  they mentioned the wrong  building name.  The guy to him  is credible.  Guys,  he's a wrestler.  Okay,  can we just fucking  move on from this?  He was a governor,  though.  He was that close  to the presidency.  That's crazy to me.  Bill needs,  like,  if you're talking  about rockets,  you need to be  a rocket scientist  or Bill won't  even listen to you.  Yes!  To a certain point.  I agree with Bill  on that,  but he was a governor.  Can I discuss the weather  if I'm not a meteorologist? 
[03:45:00]  He was a wrestler.  Yeah.  How did Schwarzenegger  become governor?  Because he was  an action hero.  That shouldn't happen.  But then they spout  off their little ideas  and people,  they leap at him.  Reagan was an actor.  He was an actor?  Yeah.  I don't know  what George Bush was.  He was the son  of the guy.  He was a good  football player.  He was the first Bush  or second Bush?  Get him in there.  Huh?  Give him a shot.  Yeah,  he was a good  football player.  We all know that.  Harvard was it 
[03:45:30]  or Yale?  Yale.  He didn't go to Harvard.  He was a C student.  Yeah,  of course he didn't  go to Harvard.  My favorite election  was 2004.  I know I've said  this before,  when your choices  were two white guys  who both went to Yale  and were members  of the Skull and Bones.  Okay,  which one do you want?  But anyone could become president.  That is funny, man.  Anyone could become president.  It's almost like  they were trying to,  if there was anything going on,  like that was the year  that they were trying  to get caught.  That was,  that was,  that was,  it's got to be exhausting 
[03:46:00]  being Bill Barr.  You got that Mitt Romney clip,  actually?  That's,  we didn't play the Mitt Romney  explaining the clip.  You heard about this,  right?  Mitt Romney was taped.  Dude,  I wouldn't know  what that guy looked like  if he walked by me.  Romney.  I don't watch any of it anymore.  He's done.  I think it's time  to get America back to work.  I'm like,  who could sit there  and watch that stupid?  But what got you finally?  Because I'm sure  you watched for a while.  What was the tipping point  for you? 
[03:46:30]  I think it's just  being in comedy.  I don't like watching  comedians who pander  to the crowd.  Yeah, yeah.  You give yourselves  a round of applause.  I mean,  I just feel like  that's what they're doing  the entire time.  So Romney was...  I think it's time  to give tax cuts  to the people  that deserve them.  I mean,  this is going to be  the easiest shit ever.  That's, yeah.  Easy applause right there.  Yeah.  It is time.  Yeah, he's right.  Oh, God.  There's a lot of patriots 
[03:47:00]  in the world.  I might be prejudiced,  but I think the biggest  patriots are in this country.  Yes, president guy.  President guy.  That is so fucking great.  We should force him  to be known as president guy.  President guy.  Every time.  President guy.  In four years,  I envision in America  that's back on top.  Some people might think  I sound crazy,  but I believe in equal pay 
[03:47:30]  for equal work.  They never say  anything controversial.  Are you saying  they're all applause  generating statements?  There's not one  controversial statement.  You know,  times are tough.  We're going to really  have to cut some corners here  and make some hard decisions.  Boo!  Boo!  That's our fault.  That's the public's fault.  Fucking,  who was it?  It wasn't,  it was Mondale said  we will have to raise taxes.  He lost 49 to 1. 
[03:48:00]  So the public has said,  tell us the truth  and we will fuck you  at the polls.  That's right.  They don't lie for no reason.  Was he the last guy  that was honest?  I hope so.  I think you might be right.  They have taught us  that if they tell us  the truth we don't like,  we're not going to forgive them.  We're not going to fucking  pull ourselves up  by our bootstraps.  We're going to fucking murder them  and go with the guy  that sold the bullshit better.  So we've asked for that treatment.  We just suck.  We really are terrible.  That's a society.  49 to 1.  That's the biggest landslide 
[03:48:30]  in history.  Let's be totally honest.  The question is,  what state did he win that year?  Not even his home state.  I don't remember.  It wasn't his home state  because I would have assumed  it would have been his home state.  No, it was not.  It was him and Ferrara.  What was the dumb state  that decided,  okay, we're going with this?  I'm going to guess it was like this.  Actually, not the dumb state.  The one state  that was being honest with itself.  Yeah.  I don't remember what the state was.  We do have to raise taxes.  Wait a minute.  I don't want to have to raise taxes,  but the people  who cook this economy  are way too powerful  for even the president  to deal with.  So you guys have to pay for it. 
[03:49:00]  Tell it works.  Shit runs downhill.  That's on your bumper sticker.  Shit runs downhill.  You think that would be  a good bumper sticker?  That's funny.  You don't want to pay taxes.  You got to make more money.  The worst is yet to come.  Dollar Shots coming out, everybody.  Dollar Shots.  I need to know.  This is ONA's Worst of 2012  on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Yay!  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012. 
[03:49:30]  Worst of 2012  for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock  and it was just a matter of time  before we got to this section  where we look back  at our former executive producer,  production guy,  Steve the Bear,  Flaming Steve,  Steve from Foundry Music,  Steve Carlisi.  Steve passed away  in July of this year.  So the first part of this  is when we actually  announced to the public  that Steve has passed on 
[03:50:00]  and then followed by that  we recap going to The Wake  and some memories of Steve.  So here it is  as the Opie and Anthony show  remembers our good pal  Steve Carlisi  for the worst of 2012.  This is actually  the worst.  This is Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2012.  So yesterday during the show  Eric left  and we were all wondering  why he was gone a long time.  I thought he was taking  a big shit. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  I said that actually  to Travis who I saw  on the glass.  We were just in the middle  of a conversation.  You're not taking a big shit?  You're not taking a big shit?  No.  And he was talking  to someone's wife.  He was getting news.  Horrible news.  Horrible news.  And it is true.  Steve C.  who was a producer for us  for many years.  Yes.  Worked with the show  for I don't know  at least 10 years.  Yeah.  Died. 
[03:51:00]  Terrible.  And I'm sick about it.  That's terrible.  And E-Rock was getting  the call from his wife  what yesterday  during the show?  Yeah.  And then you chose  to tell us right after the show.  Yeah.  Yeah I didn't want to  interrupt with what  you had going on  at that time.  Poor E-Rock.  He has to break the news  when it should be  someone like Kenny  who just loves  things like that.  Yeah.  But you know  had to be E-Rock.  Poor innocent little Nagel.  Yeah he should have  gave the job to Kenny right? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  He's probably mad today.  Kenny would have come in  remembering what it was like  to be a cop  and knock on some stranger's door  and watch him just break down  on the floor.  Right.  I'm sorry for your loss.  I know people mean well  but people are just stupid.  stupid and one of those  stupid people today  is Kevin from Connecticut  who's like a  Oh Kevin what happened?  Who's an Uber fan.  He's like he writes me  this is his condolence tweet to me.  I know you and Steve  weren't the best of friends. 
[03:52:00]  And I was telling Ant  just before the show  I'm like how do you know that?  Because first of all  it's not true.  How do you know that?  It's not even close to true.  How do you know that  Kevin from Connecticut?  He just writes  I know you and Steve  weren't the best of friends.  That's not true.  People are commenting  yeah Kevin you queer.  It's not true.  They're bashing Kevin now.  Unfortunately about  two years ago  Steve had to leave the show  because they just  eliminated his position.  Yeah.  They didn't want to pay 
[03:52:30]  anybody anymore.  And you know  and he went on  to a few other radio jobs  and we were all tight.  We were all good.  We were all good with Steve.  So I know you and him  weren't the best of friends  is the stupidest thing  I've read in a long time.  He's commenting  he's saying  it's because you yelled  at him a lot.  Oh really?  You don't know  you don't know  what we  what we were about  behind the scenes  so stop. 
[03:53:00]  Keep digging a hole there  Kevin from Connecticut.  Because we yelled a lot?  You don't know me.  Kevin I met you once  you don't know me.  Oh man.  None of these people  know who I am.  You don't know me.  You know a part of me.  You have no idea  the phone calls  and the times  we hung out.  So you know  it's a really sad day.  I remember  bringing him on  to NEW  back in the day.  He would send us tapes.  Yeah back in the day. 
[03:53:30]  And he sent me  a bunch of tapes.  He really wanted  to be in radio bed.  He was doing like  small town radio  but he had that voice  and at the time  we had a position  for like  I think it was  an assistant  production director  at the time right?  Yeah.  Like a  basically  low level position.  He grabbed it  and he ran with it.  He also realized  we didn't have a website  so he took it  upon himself  to build a website  for us basically.  And watermark everything.  He watermarked everything. 
[03:54:00]  I'm not saying  it was perfect.  I'm not saying  it was perfect.  Oh my god.  But he did pick up  on our laziness  so I have a love-hate  with that watermark  because we weren't  doing anything.  See now you're just  giving Kevin  from Connecticut  an excuse.  No but we even  got past that.  We even got past that.  And the fact remains  that he gave us  a massive visual element  and that was his in.  I mean he started  as an assistant  production director  and then he 
[03:54:30]  really worked  that website  for the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Wow man.  When no one  had websites.  Yeah it was pretty  pretty good.  It was of course  Foundry.  Yeah.  Foundry Music.  I mean the old  listeners remember  me saying a million  times you know  foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com  Yes.  I probably said that  10,000 times  easily.  Yeah.  Easily.  Remember that.  To try to get to  you know people  to the website  to check out  our shit. 
[03:55:00]  Videos,  pictures,  sounds,  everything.  Stinky cam.  Everything.  So  Iraq what can you  tell us?  All right.  Well  without going into  any details  dummy.  Yeah.  Well how about  how about this  you talked to him  two days ago  right?  Yeah on Tuesday  morning.  Because he  because you  invited him to  your house  warming that  we're all going  to tomorrow  man.  Yeah and  he hadn't 
[03:55:30]  responded yet  so I didn't  know.  Usually he  would tell me  right away  yes or no  if he could  come out.  So I sent  him a text  like hey  are you guys  coming?  And he  called me  and he said  I don't think  we're going to  be able to  make it.  It's our  anniversary  and we're  probably going  to do  something this  weekend.  So I said  okay we'll  get together  another time  no problem.  And yeah  that was the  last I heard  from him.  Right.  And then  yesterday I  get the  phone call  from his  wife.  His beautiful 
[03:56:00]  wife by the  way.  Yeah.  And his  kids what  like two  and a half?  Yeah he's  not far off  from your  son.  Your son.  So his  kid is about  two and a  half.  That's just  brutal man.  Yeah.  That is  fucking brutal.  And you got  the news  yesterday and  then you told  us I was  just staring  at you like  all right  nice bit.  You were  getting mad  and I was  trying to  tell you I'm  like I'm  not making  this up.  Well people  get mad  because they  don't want  to believe.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:56:30]  It's natural.  Yeah.  So I was  talking to her  yesterday and  obviously she's  upset and  angry by  everything and  that Steve  had  died  Wednesday  night.  Jeez.  Yeah.  It sucks.  Such as  what they  say.  Life.  Yeah.  Life.  You don't  like this  shit do  you?  No it's 
[03:57:00]  terrible.  No one  really likes  it though.  It's terrible  terrible.  No one  really likes  it at all.  I hate  it.  Yeah.  I had to  block a few  people last  night on  Twitter.  I just  inconsiderate  fuckwads that  think they're a  little too  close to the  situation but  they're not.  you know  they I  think I  and I  guess you  know I  understand that  fans of the  show and  you know we  pour everything  out on here so  they think  they're a little  closer to to  all of us than  they really are  right and they  think that it  gives them the  opportunity to  presume that they  can say whatever 
[03:57:30]  the fuck they  want and some of  the stuff they  say is I  think they mean  it to be funny  but it's not  you know in  those situations  and well I  mean the  argument by  they would argue  that we make  fun of everybody  and everyone's  death but we  don't know those  people that's the  difference exactly  and you know call  it hypocritical but  that's just the  way it is it's  probably go fuck  yourself it's  probably a bit  hypocritical to be  honest with you  it probably is you  know fair enough  but I saw nothing  but people being 
[03:58:00]  cool last night I  really did oh  fucking it was  unbelievable  point nine percent  but same thing  when when we lost  Patrice people people  who are true fans of  the show just get  it exactly just get  it on these  really low horrible  days and there is  a difference in our  dumb world  lost a lot of  pounds of friends  on the Soapy and  Anthony show of  late above the  past year many  pounds of friends  who did we lose in  the last year alone  Iraq is this show  cursed we lost we're 
[03:58:30]  just old we're just  getting up to that  age  the obvious one  Patrice  Steve C  Mike DeStefano  Geraldo  that's all within  the last year and  a half or so  right  Geraldo's about  two now  two  yeah  yeah that sucks  scissors  so it's  I tweeted a  fucking  a Coke  Logic video  cartoon that he 
[03:59:00]  made last night  which one  with Steve  it was what we  were just bashing  Steve shopping at  Lane Bryant  right  it was that one  fucking funny man  goddamn Coke  Logic makes some  great shit  yeah  Steve gave us  amazing shit  he made such a  great Steve  cartoon too  Steve where's your  music  he goes right  here  oh he's  oh  pause this  I'll set it up  put all this shit  on our Facebook  page there  Iraq  Opie and Anthony 
[03:59:30]  one word on  Facebook  so what is this  just him talking  about his band  Foundry  yeah and of course  we just fucking  relentlessly pound him  about it  was this the first  time we ever  heard  I'm not sure  wow  is it  I don't think  I remember when he  finally brought that  CD in  and that's to this  day one of my  favorite bits from  this show  oh really  oh yeah  it's a great  fucking  so how long  is that bit  maybe we should  play that today  I don't know  Eric  that was a good  one  that one's a bit 
[04:00:00]  longer  yeah I mean  hang on  you guys kind of  went a long time  I think it was  like 34 minutes  oh really  it's great though  because  it's something  but if it's worth  playing  I mean this is  a weird day  I mean it's just  you don't know  what to say or do  to be completely  honest with you  it's great because  the CD was something  that you guys had  heard about for so  long  and he finally  brought it in  yeah  you know  you want to play  this  yeah so this is  the animation  that Coke Logic 
[04:00:30]  did  yeah  Coke Logic is  amazing  Coke Logic on  Twitter  there's your music  he goes right here  oh he's so  oh he looks so sad  and dejected  oh come on  Foundry  no energy  he's like  oh it's right here  the name of the CD  you guys put out  was What Kills Me  that's right  our own Steve  very aggressive  and you were the singer  I guarantee you  Steve right now  is secretly hoping  that there's a big  talent scout listening  no I'm not  who will recognize  that Foundry  was a band  that was overlooked  guys  you guys weren't  looking at this  closely  oh no what  Steve would you like 
[04:01:00]  to let everyone know  what your rock name was  oh my god  oh yeah  Stephen Carr  let me clarify one thing  oh boy  I forgot about that  if I find out  if you spell  the C-A-R-R  yeah  I'm gonna smash  into your face  yes I did  this is Steve Carr  on vocals  was Steve  douche taken  how many times  did you rehearse  the speech  at the Grammys  they normally  don't recognize 
[04:01:30]  this kind of music  I'm sure I had  those conversations  with myself  like you know  in the shower  or at night  this lead singer  of a popular band  is actually named  Steve Carleese  and everyone knows it  who is Steve Carr  Steve Carr is correct  that's right  yes Steve Carr  this band actually  put out one CD  and it sucks a bag of ass  who's Steve  I used to wear  these awful get ups  with  I had  since I was so big  I couldn't buy  stage clothes  in normal 
[04:02:00]  I couldn't buy  off the rack  so I was going  to Lane Bryant  the fat woman  oh my god  Steve Carr  gets his clothes  from Elaine Bryant  we'll tell you more  in this issue  of Tiger Beat  and I had this  yes indeed  you would go to  Elaine Bryant  and what would you  buy for your  crazy stage outfit  a 3x  leopard skin  blouse  I had that  I had  gold sequined  Doc Martens

[04:04:30]  for the people  who don't know  an intern  who worked with us  for a long  fucking time  until we got fired  and then  he got his name  because one  his first day  of the job  he smelled  and it was just  it was a coincidence  it was just a dumb  like  we all smell  I went to the  Soup Nazi  my first day  and got lobster bisque  right  and one of the guys  goes  what's that fucking smell  right  and it was  fucking  Stinky  good thing  those things  don't stick  right  oh man  but I mean

[04:06:30]  for  I don't know  me and Ed  have been doing this  18 years  and he was part of it  for at least  at least 10  at least 10  yeah  6 at  Satellite  and yeah  he probably was  yeah  about 10 years  I would say  and  he died  unexpectedly  a couple days ago  that's terrible  and  you know  we're sick  and heartbroken  about it  to be completely  honest with you  and you know  we don't know  what to do  I don't even know 
[04:07:00]  if we should be here  today  but whatever  this is  Opinette  Anthony's worst  of 2012  it was not fun  yesterday  well  I went up there  oh you did  oh yeah I did  oh yes I did  me and Iraq  took the long ride  whoa  into the saddest town  I've ever been to  I wouldn't doubt it  it was the saddest town  I've been to  yeah  and then you had the wake  which was beyond  was beyond sad 
[04:07:30]  ah  open coffin  there's  there's our pal  oh  Jesus  there's our pal  Steve C  just laying there  wow that's  this town  how depressing  was this town  Iraq  I mean  driving in the town  you know  you're going to  something really sad  is it an old  broke coal town  or something  I believe so  that's exactly  what I was going to say  you know those videos  when they show you  the old coal boom  and the steel boom  how these were  thriving cities  and everything  has not changed 
[04:08:00]  throughout the existence  of this city  like whatever was built  in that time  is still there  nothing's new  the roads aren't  paved  correctly  there's not even a hint  of a new paint job  on anything  I mean anything  a fence post  a sign  a storefront  nothing  one like  one theater movie theaters  the town was just gray  wow  I would call the  if you had to  like yeah  talk about the color  of the town  it would be gray  there was no color 
[04:08:30]  in this entire town  it was just a lot  of fading  fading storefronts  that's pretty much it  fading houses  the houses were  kind of kept up  but it was  it was just  a very sad town  yeah  and then we got  to the funeral home  and that just put it  over the top obviously  oh good  he didn't live  he lived about  40 minutes away from there  they chose  a sad town I think  what  well they don't want  the memory of  you know  you know  smirching the town  that they live in 
[04:09:00]  so they decided  to do all this  sadness somewhere else  I do believe  because he didn't live  anywhere as close  to where we were  that's a good idea  so you don't have  to drive past  the place every day  and all that right  yeah I never thought  of that  it was  it was horrific  wow  I'll tell you this much  it was the worst  wake I've ever been to  whoa  including  including  my own father  holy shit  cakes  I wanted to go to that  I'm frustrated that I couldn't  because of Jim's wedding  I was telling Ann  how it was the saddest 
[04:09:30]  wake I've ever been to  including my own father's  Jesus  oh okay  yeah  open casket  and then his  you know  he has a two year old  and all the kid drawings  that you normally see  in a fucking  refrigerator  do you want me to  get into this  oh my god  just move on  stuff you normally  would see in a refrigerator  is now  you know  on the lid of the coffin  because it's an open  casket  him holding a teddy bear  that obviously  had something to do  with him and his kid  it was horrendous 
[04:10:00]  Jesus  I don't think  I've ever cried  more in my life  Jesus  it was horrendous  I don't cry much  it was horrendous  open casket  you look great  they always do  he looked great  it's amazing  when you're dead  it's like  why don't these  makeup people  fucking help us  when we're alive  people look terrific  when they're fucking off  yeah  it's a miserable one  MJ was  beyond cool  and  you know  we gotta get a fun going 
[04:10:30]  yeah  I think we're gonna do  something this week  but  it was the worst one  I've ever been to  unfortunately  you get to an age  where  you lose more friends  than you gain  but this one was bad  bad  I didn't talk to her  I called her  and we  you know  it's like  you just missed each other  how is she holding up  normal shit  you know  no worse than 
[04:11:00]  you know  she's playing her part  she's playing her part  she's numb  yeah  she's fucking out of her mind  she's got a two year old  and her daughter  from another  marriage  I believe  who's about 17  I think  16 or 17  looks just like her  yep  yep  yep  yep  yep  yep  me and Iroch  took the long ride  it was  it was horrendous  the ride with Iroch  actually we kinda 
[04:11:30]  in a weird way  enjoyed ourselves  like just talking  oh is he back on your hero list  Iroch  reminiscing  come on  he moved up a level  aw  that's nice  well you can't go through  something like that  and then come back to work  and think it's like  it changes  you fucking went through  like a little  combat shit together  it changes a little bit  it's like you're  you're war buddies now  it changed a little bit  where was it  it was in a tiny little  it was just outside of Scranton  oh Scranton 
[04:12:00]  in a tiny little town  and for the people  I'm sure we have just  maybe a couple  listeners from that area  the town is horrendous  yeah  which didn't help matters  obviously  it was just a horrible  old grey town  it's just  the town just looks sad  people asking  any road sodas  on the way  any road sodas  well after it was all over  I go  you wanna get a beer  and Iroch just goes  yes  so then  I'm trying to find a place  where maybe we could have a beer  fight at the local  fucking  well  the local Pennsylvania 
[04:12:30]  bar  road house  yeah  we saw four or five bars  oh boy  and every single one of them  the windows were blocked out  oh yeah  and I'm like  I don't think it's a good idea  to go into any of these local bars  there's shit going on in there  yeah I don't know  I don't know what's going on  in these places  so we ended up getting  a really sad slice of pizza  even the pizza place was sad  I at one point  it was one of the  few jokes  I go  I feel like I'm in a Quentin Tarantino movie  we're eating pizza in this room 
[04:13:00]  that's all just paneling  and has like  kind of Harley Davidson  looks like where they're gonna plan  the heist or the murder  right  and a TV on  that just has this  what was on the TV  it was like an old show  or something  some Hall of Fame movie  it was just  it was just like  it couldn't have been  it couldn't be a worse day  to be honest with you  what a horrible place  and the lady  the lady was so depressed  she was sad  she was probably about  24, 25  looking at us  with this like  distant look  take me with you  basically  I was gonna say that 
[04:13:30]  you beat me to the punch  a distant look in her eyes  like just take me with you  and the pizza was bad  yikes  pizza tastes like something  you would just  you know  get in a supermarket  and cook at home  I don't know  this is a rough one  there was a lot of people there  and I think  95%  we didn't  we didn't know anybody  we literally didn't know anybody  Drew Boogie was there  that was that was  pretty much the only person  I knew  pretty much it  yeah huh 
[04:14:00]  yeah  I don't know what else to say  it's just whatever  that sounds like a  fucking  do we know anything else  about it  or do we not know  or do we not know  no  you know  Bobby's face is just like  I don't like that shit  I don't like that shit  no one likes that shit  you can't  un-forget it  that's what it is  but no one likes that shit  I know  you're not alone  no I know  but the last thing  I wanted to do yesterday 
[04:14:30]  was drive all the way up there  to see our power  I don't do that  I don't get it  I just don't understand  the whole fucking thing  you do it for  you do it for the people  that are still alive  no  like I  how about a fucking phone call  and flowers  or something  I can't deal with  going to a fucking place  like that  and remembering that  where are you getting mad  you know what I remember  I'm getting mad at the whole system  oh  well MJ can't deal with it  so what do you do  I went up to her  I hugged her  I cried like a baby  we were both shaking  she's like  what am I gonna do  I go  well we'll try to do 
[04:15:00]  what we can for you  I know our listeners are great  and we'll  we'll set up some kind of fund  and hopefully  that'll help a little bit  at least  I said don't worry  about everything  you know  she was just like  piling on everything  and I'm just like  wow  what do you say to someone  so let's  let's just  you just try to get through  the next few days  that's your whole job  just get through  the next few days  don't worry about  all this other shit  right now  kids two years old  two years old  like how does  how does that  how does that work  in his mind  how does the kid grow up  I don't know

[04:16:00]  about how his son's  been dealing with this  and it was  if you haven't been  devastated by anything  this was just  it was so difficult  he doesn't know yet  and he's not going to  know for a while  that his dad's not  around  and  well one  one thing  she told me  was  I was asking  how he was doing  is he here  no  they had him at a  babysitter  he's not fully aware  yet  and the day before  he's just going around 
[04:16:30]  the place  going dad  dad  dad  dad's not there  so he got frustrated  went to the top  of the stairs  and just started  yelling Steve  trying to find him  yikes  and  I don't know  it's just so  heartbreaking  it's miserable  it's fucking miserable  holy Toledo  I'm still shaking  it was a bad day  yesterday man  bug  it was horrendous
