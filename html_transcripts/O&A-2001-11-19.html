<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a call from Nicole, a Mormon woman who discussed her mental health struggles, including past suicide attempts and bipolar disorder.  The hosts responded with highly offensive and sexually charged comments targeting her weight, appearance, and lifestyle choices, referencing her Mormon youth group games.  This was followed by a heated phone argument with comedian Richard Jenneys, whom Opie and Anthony lambasted for his recent comedy material and perceived lack of backbone in not confronting them directly about his opinions during a previous studio appearance.  Throughout this segment, the hosts repeatedly used vulgar and offensive language and discussed a contract dispute with their employers concerning censored content.  Madison, a female guest, was present in studio for a "Shave Bush for Bush" campaign, though details were brief.  The segment concluded with listener calls sharing their "What Did We Learn Today?" observations, reflecting the show's crude humor and topics.

The show continued with a series of short, disjointed segments.  The hosts made a homophobic slur, referring to someone as a "faggot." A caller offered brief, humorous updates, including his physical measurements ("5'5", 170 pounds"), a negative review of either Richard Jenneys or Harry Connick Jr.'s work, and the advice "Read the book before seeing the movie."  The hosts then discussed receiving promotional Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper dolls from Art Asylum and McFarlane Toys, providing listeners with purchase information. A brief advertisement for NewYorkHairRemoval.com, focusing on postpartum recovery, aired. The show concluded with mentions of Jim Brewer ticket giveaways and a nonsensical chant about an "incest couch."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Sinning whore.  Not your church, I mean real church. It's against the church.  No, it's not.  Are you a Catholic?  No, I'm Mormon.  Do you drink them?  Oh, that's right, Mormon.  What made you pick Mormon?  Because I denounced the Catholic Church.  Why? Why? Why?  Because they just don't know what they're talking about, and I think that they're wrong.  Nicole, you're a quitter.  Well, my church has a lot more faith than I've met in Catholic churches.  No, it's just a little easier to deal with, isn't it?  If you're going to go with a religion, you've got to go with the strictest one ever. 
[00:00:30]  Isn't it against religion to kill yourself, too, right?  Yeah, it's against religion to try to kill yourself.  You're a quitter. You couldn't even kill yourself.  And doesn't bipolar mean you want to have sex with male and female polars?  No. God, you are sick, man.  Yeah.  Your friend is sick there, you know.  I want you to come down to the studio so I can stare you down.  Well, one, I don't know where you are, and two, I have to be a family home evening in a little while.  You have to go where?  Family home evening.  What is that? 
[00:01:00]  It's where me and the other Mormon youth gather together and do something as a group.  What do you usually do? Give us a little insight.  Last week, we played Do You Love Your Neighbor?  Do you love your neighbor?  Yeah, I stared her through a window and spanked a batch out on my air conditioner.  Do you love your neighbor? What does that mean?  It's Davy and Goliath over here.  That's awful.  It's a game.  And how do you play the game?  It's the game. 
[00:01:30]  Someone stands up and everyone sits around.  Okay.  And the one person will call somebody and say, like, John, do you love your neighbor?  And the person says yes or no.  If the person says yes, then he has to say something like, but I don't like people who have black hair.  And everyone that has black hair has to get up and switch seats with somebody else.  All right, look, Nicole, you're not crazy.  When do you drink the Kool-Aid?  You just need, like, real friends.  I know.  When do you drink the Kool-Aid laced with arsenic, Nicole, with this cult you're in? 
[00:02:00]  Why don't you play on a cult?  When is the mothership coming to you take your Nike shoes and bodies to the Comet?  What?  Exactly.  You're in...  Why don't I play...  Chris, would you shut up for five minutes?  Hey, Nicole.  Your life stinks.  What?  Why don't you play spin the dirty needle with a couple of guys?  Funny, funny, funny.  I'm not into drugs.  Why don't you go do things that kids your age like to do?  I enjoy what I do.  No, you don't.  That is the worst. 
[00:02:30]  That's the worst.  It's not in a girl your age is nature.  What is it called?  I love my neighbor, but not ones with goatees, aunt.  Okay, let's change seats.  It's meant to be funny.  No, it's not funny.  Richard Pryor's funny.  Unless there's quarters going into cups and drinking beer, I don't want to play.  Well, then you need to...  What other games do you play with the Mormons?  Yeah.  Last week, last Monday we played this game where we had to run around the room and then... 
[00:03:00]  Run around the room doing what?  And what?  Well, no, we had to run out of the room, put a coat, hat, gloves, and a scarf on,  and then come back in the room and try and eat...  Molest the small boy.  And what?  Eat a piece of...  Eat parts of the chocolate bar with two spoons.  But you couldn't use your hands.  All you can use was...  I think that's a good game, actually.  What the hell is that?  That's a good game.  And what does this exercise prove?  Nothing.  It's just meant to be fun and to socialize. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, so that's your socializing with other people that can't take life and have found  refuge in some worship of some fake thing.  How about just getting a bunch of people together and getting naked and having a gangbang?  Yeah.  Ha.  Well, I don't believe in that.  Yes, you do.  You bang every other week and your boyfriend's in prison because of you.  Yes, you do.  Okay, I have not had...  Shut up, stupid.  Yes, you have.  In several months.  In a couple of months.  Several months.  Shut your lying face.  Yes, you have.  You have.  You're giving the Mormons a bad name today. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Dirty Mary Magdalene.  So what are you doing tonight with the Mormons?  Did we figure that out?  You're not playing love thy neighbor or whatever it's called?  I don't know what we're doing tonight because I wasn't in church yesterday.  Oh, what happened?  What made you miss church on a Sunday?  I was busy puking.  I was sick.  You were drinking too much Saturday, weren't you?  No.  Where were you sick from?  I have no idea.  Probably because I didn't eat when I took my medication again.  Oh.  Get off the medication.  If I get off the medication, I'll try and kill myself again. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  You can't even do that right.  You can't even get that job done.  Hey, if I wanted to, I could do it, okay?  I'll give you a whole list of ways to kill yourself, okay?  Why don't you run out of the room and put on a coat and a hat and then run back in and  grab a razor?  Okay, you're funny.  All right.  Okay, could you do me a big favor?  No.  Please?  No.  All right.  What?  Um, I was wondering if you could, like, send a t-shirt here to my brother.  Poor guy. 
[00:05:00]  He's got to deal with her.  He seems a little kooky, too.  Is your father still in your life?  Yeah.  He's sleeping in the other room.  Why isn't he working?  Because he had the day off, because I had to go to the orthodontist.  Well, you got braces?  I had, I've just gotten them off.  What a mess.  21 braces.  She's a kook.  Are you hot?  Yes.  How much do you weigh?  I don't know.  How much?  Probably about 170.  170?  170.  Fat, psycho bitch. 
[00:05:30]  How tall are you?  Four foot one.  Five five.  Five five.  That's well-proportioned if you're a neutron star.  Five five 170 is off my chart.  Way, way off.  No, most skinny.  Yeah, they like the fat girls.  Thank you.  You just said what a BBW is.  Skinny guys that bang fat chicks.  They like the fat girls.  They get turned on by fat girls.  Well, I don't think so.  Fat girls got to try a little harder though, right?  I have no trouble getting guys.  You must give a good hummer, because the fat girls give the best. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And while you're doing it, you're just thinking, please love me.  Please love me.  Hey, I have no trouble in the love department.  The guy I put in jail.  Let's play love thy mule.  She's proud of it.  The guy I put in jail is still calling me and still wants to see me.  Of course.  Because you obviously give it to him good.  Because you're a little dirty whore slut.  I'm not.  You know what you should do?  Run a nice warm bath and play love thy razor. 
[00:06:30]  I don't need to.  When you puke on Saturday, did it look like Elmer's glue?  No.  Okay.  I thought maybe your stomach was upset.  It looked like, um.  All right.  Great.  You don't want to know.  Thank you, Nicole.  Thank you, son of a bitch.  Well, we learned a little bit about bipolar.  Okay.  Admit it.  You kind of like the contest, the shaving thing.  It's patriotic.  No, it's not.  Yeah.  You kind of like it.  Come on.  You're not supposed to like it because you think you're a Mormon.  No.  I called only to say that, but then I got stuck talking to you. 
[00:07:00]  No, you didn't.  You wanted to talk because you're lonely.  You need the attention.  I don't believe in hanging up on people.  No, you're fat and you smell like lamb.  That's the problem.  You have a lamb-like odor wafting off your fat body.  I'm not fat.  You are.  You're 170 and 5'5".  And how old are you?  20.  20.  That'll be 200 before July.  Is it only...  I've been 200 pounds before and I've lost the weight.  You're a three six-pack bang.  Is it skin?  Is it your ass that's fat? 
[00:07:30]  No.  What's fat on you?  You got a gut?  Yes.  That means you eat too much.  Yes, I do.  Big fat gut.  And you'll blame that on the medication too.  No, I don't.  The medication makes me hungry.  I get the munchies.  No, I don't.  I just eat whenever I feel like it.  That's healthy and self-restraining.  Good job.  Why don't you like to shave?  Can't you reach around?  Is that the problem?  You always wind up butchering it because you miss?  The bunt.  I can reach anywhere I want to shave.  And Nicole, do you see the disappointment in your parents' faces when you get up in the morning 
[00:08:00]  to go to school with your fat body?  I don't go to school.  You don't even go to school?  Why?  Because I'm 20.  I graduated high school.  What do you do for a living?  I don't work.  What do you do?  Nothing.  Fat.  She's fat.  I can't work.  I have a broken wrist right now.  That's why I don't work right now.  Let me put some pieces of this puzzle together.  She's fat, right?  She's fat.  Skinny guys like her.  Skinny guys that are in jail like her. 
[00:08:30]  Do you have bleach blonde hair?  No, my hair is brown.  What was the last job you had?  I was working for Domino's Pizza.  What ethnic background do you like in a boy?  Doesn't matter.  Yeah, that seems to be where I'm going here.  I like big butts and I cannot lie.  Why did you leave Domino's?  Because I moved back to Middletown.  Eating the inventory.  You got fired.  What did you say?  Because my brother just said something. 
[00:09:00]  Are you going to get another job soon?  Yes.  As soon as my hand heals, I'm going to be working at the pizza place around the block.  Oh, yeah.  And how did we break the hand?  I punched their wall.  Why?  Because Daddy didn't give you something?  What did Daddy not do this time?  It wasn't my father.  It was my social worker.  You have a social worker?  Social worker.  And look how she's bragging that the guy in jail wants to have sex with her.  He's in jail.  Why do you have a social worker?  Because you're trying to kill yourself?  Well, to whoever asked about my ex-friend in jail, I don't talk to him. 
[00:09:30]  The last I spoke to him was when...  All right.  You said he calls all the time.  I don't talk to him.  Why do you have a social worker?  Because when I was living in a group home, they made me have one.  Group home involved now, too?  You are just a mess.  Yeah, I was.  You are a mess.  I was.  What does your mom do?  My mother is a nurse.  A nurse.  Your poor mom.  And so is my father.  I see what happened.  And I'm also a licensed medic.  Her mother takes care of other people and just didn't take care of you enough. 
[00:10:00]  Good point.  My mom took very good care of me.  Maybe technically, you know, making sure you had food and stuff.  But the love and attention went to other people because that's what she does.  And it left you out in the cold.  She's only been a nurse for the past three years.  Left you out in the cold.  How big is your mom?  How fat is she?  Yeah, she must be huge, right?  She's like 110 pounds.  And how big is your dad?  That is about 6'3", maybe.  That's like 6'3".  I don't know how much she weighs.  Nicole, why do you consistently work around food? 
[00:10:30]  Can you get a job that you cannot shove into your face when you have a moment of loneliness?  I don't eat the food at these places, man.  Oh, thank you.  Lieutenant Boogaloo, check it in.  This is for Nicole.  Ways to die.  Number one, step into traffic.  Number two, jump out a window.  Hang yourself with a ceiling fan.  Jump into a bathtub with a toaster.  Slam hard into a wall.  Stick a garbage bag over your head and suffocate.  Okay, no, you'll just stop.  Oh, yeah, no, that'll work if you tie a cord around the back. 
[00:11:00]  Jab a pen into your eye.  Let mommy suffocate you with a pillow.  Starve.  Oh, wait, she's fat.  Yeah.  Thank you, Lieutenant Boogaloo.  Well, I have done the walking in traffic thing, but I got arrested for it.  Walking in traffic.  Why did they think you were an escaped elephant?  You guys are so bad.  Yeah.  Well, have fun with your little Mormon group there. 
[00:11:30]  That ought to be good.  Yeah, you'll learn something about me on this show.  I have no sympathy for mental illness.  None whatsoever.  I didn't think you did.  I don't think you have sympathy for anything.  Suck it up and walk it off.  That's right.  Walk it off.  How do you ever get a girl to like you?  Walk it off.  Waddle it off, dick.  How do you get a girlfriend with that attitude, man?  With a gun.  By my chiseled features.  No, I'll tell you how.  He's got a big mule and he's rich. 
[00:12:00]  Maybe I'll go out with him.  By my chiseled cheekbones.  Yeah, okay.  And my surfer good looks.  Boyish charm.  My boyish charm.  Yes.  Smooth abs.  My guileish smile.  Tim from Philly.  Her father must cry every day when he wakes up and looks at his fat, melodramatic bitch  of a daughter and pays for a social worker while she sits home all day and eats out of  the fridge.  Cut the cord.  Drop her sack of wet laundry.  Nicole, if you were my daughter growing up, I would have beat the crap out of you. 
[00:12:30]  That's what you needed.  A good beating.  I'll have you know that when we were little, my father did discipline us.  Not enough.  I think a little more than you're saying.  Yellow discipline?  Did you have some of the yellow discipline or the brown discipline?  Shut up.  I want a hot lunch.  Uh-oh.  Hey, how does it feel to know that all that money being wasted on the social worker, your  dad can't get the NFL package on the satellite dish just so you can sit home and shove  food in your dumb face.  I'm not home during the day.  Shut it, stupid. 
[00:13:00]  I'm not finished.  And play love thy neighbor.  Yeah, well, where are you during the day?  I'm out with other people.  Doing what?  Walking around.  I go to the mall.  I go to the movies.  You're walking around.  Cute.  How does it feel that you got no sympathy from us today?  I didn't want sympathy from you.  I called to insult you.  Don't worry.  This is tough love, Opie.  Don't worry.  Go wake up, Dad.  He'll show you some sympathy and give you a couple twinkies.  He's listening to this right now.  He can hear you.  I thought he was sleeping.  You lie a lot. 
[00:13:30]  My brother woke him up with the radio, okay?  Let's talk to your dad.  No.  Put your dad.  How old is he?  48.  Put him on the phone.  No.  Yes.  Put him on the phone.  I don't think so.  Put him on the phone.  No.  Put him on the phone.  No.  Put him on the phone.  You're not my father.  Thank God.  You cannot tell me what to do.  Thank God.  Bye, Nicole.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  Wait, wait.  I can't put him on the phone.  He's busy in the tub with a toaster.  All right.  Well, I hope we helped. 
[00:14:00]  I hope we helped, Opie.  It's tough love.  Life blows.  You can't even say poor parents because they're probably the ones responsible.  I don't know.  Sometimes they're not, man.  For what just happened there.  Sometimes they're not.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Ugh.  Well, get off.  What's the matter, Opie?  You don't feel for the girl?  I hate mental illness.  Well, I don't know many people that enjoy it.  I think most of them are fakers. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, gee, Opie, that's not very nice.  Looking for sympathy and looking for love they didn't get while they were growing up.  And he means it.  Okay.  Terrific.  A little frightening.  Let's go to the F.U. line and regroup here, all right?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, ONA.  I just want to leave a fake, scheming F.U. out to the real f***er of the week.  This f***er was on the North State Parkway with a truck, which you guys know from being on the lounge, not allowed. 
[00:15:00]  And he got stuck in the tunnel.  So I'm back a little bit.  All of a sudden I hear, boom.  What did this idiot do?  This brain starts just stuck in the tunnel.  He keeps scraping up the parts, coming up the truck, started smoking.  And I was stuck like I was in my driveway for an hour and a half.  People like this did not have a driver's license.  So, hey, if you're listening to the drive of that truck, go ask yourself.  Next message.  This big f*** you goes out to Monica.  Thank you for breaking up with me the day after my surgery and doing it to me via email. 
[00:15:30]  And a big F.U. to all you women out there because you all suck.  Next message.  Yo, this big F.U. goes out there.  Anthony, hey, Anthony, f*** you for teaching us all that it's okay to go wah, wah, wah.  You guys suck later.  End of message.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch grabbing. 
[00:16:00]  Anthony.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it.  Opie and Anthony show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The lovely Madison has arrived for the Shave Bush for Bush campaign, Anthony.  Most of the ladies letting us down today.  But Madison, we'll get her in in a few minutes, Rick, and explain what's going on with that. 
[00:16:30]  Ladies, it's not too late.  If you're in the area, stop on by and help us out, okay?  Yes.  That last phone call just drove me nuts.  I don't understand why you got so pissed off at her.  Let me tell you something.  There are so many people that I guess all of us have come across in our lives.  I'll speak for a lot of people.  Yeah.  And these people will brag that they tried to kill themselves, Anthony.  Right.  And then they tell you in a way like they're bragging. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I tried to kill myself.  No, you didn't.  You were reaching out for attention.  All right.  Anthony, if you were going to kill yourself, what would you do?  Seriously.  I don't know.  I'm so not into doing that.  But I guess...  Well, you would find a way where you make sure you get the job done.  Yes.  Definite and painless.  You don't want yourself left crippled or retarded.  That's got to be bad.  And you know there are people out there going, my life is so horrible, it's so awful, I'm going to kill myself. 
[00:17:30]  They try.  They wake up in the hospital.  But there's a door.  I did the hot oxygen to my brain, father.  And then you're like, now look at you.  I say if you're going to kill yourself, don't be a pussy.  Go for it.  Well, what?  Jump off a building.  See, now there's another thing.  I don't want to take anyone else out.  Well, make sure you don't take anyone out.  You've got to be nice.  You can jump off the building at 3 in the morning. 
[00:18:00]  There's not as many people walking the streets.  Train ain't good either because the guy's driving the train.  All of a sudden now he's like, oh, if I would have seen it, if I could have stopped.  You don't want to screw up other people.  I see the other side of the coin.  You're the driver of that train.  You're like, cool, I saw something wild today.  No.  People don't like that.  There's suicide by cop that people use.  They pull out a fake gun and have a cop shoot him.  That screws up the rest of the cop's life.  But that last call drove me nuts.  She was bragging because, you know, I try to kill myself, you know. 
[00:18:30]  I slit my wrist.  Wearing it like a badge of honor.  Exactly.  And then they get with groups of other people that have done this and they talk about it.  It drives me nuts.  She's a waste of space.  Some of our fine men and women are over there in Afghanistan.  They are going to die for freedom.  They're going to die for the fight on terrorism.  Unfortunately, it's going to happen.  And eventually, those reports are going to come in.  And here's this fat body, waste of space, nothing, Mormon.  That's disgusting fat body.  That just walks the malls every day getting fatter. 
[00:19:00]  Drives me nuts.  Well.  Looking for attention.  There's nothing to do with attention.  Oh, here we go.  Yes, hello.  Oh, just say the wrong thing.  Your name is Dawn?  Yes.  It has nothing to do with attention at all.  What does it have to do?  It has to do with a mental disorder, a chemical imbalance in her brain.  She has no control over this.  You can't blame it on her.  You can't tell her to go kill herself.  Oh, okay.  Because you don't understand it.  Well, don't you think...  I can understand that.  And it's the thing about the trying to kill yourself and then wearing it like a badge kind of thing. 
[00:19:30]  That's what...  Well, because you were poking fun at her.  You kept nagging her and insisting, oh, you don't have to...  You forced her to defend herself.  She called the show, stupid.  I heard her call the show.  I heard what she said.  And yes, I agree.  She was annoying.  But that gives you no reason to make fun of having a mental disorder.  You know what you are?  You're an overprotective, overly anecdotal...  God, I suck!  Yeah, I'm an analytical...  I know I'm a silent psych student.  That's why I'm a psych student.  What are you?  What are you? 
[00:20:00]  Psych student.  Oh, you stupid college idiot.  Shut up.  You're getting into the real world.  I study psychology.  You're an ass.  What really bothered me was that she was pretty much bragging that she tried to kill herself.  Well, her brother brought it up.  She had no choice in that.  He brought it up and then you guys proceed to...  No one has a choice, do they, Dawn?  We're all victims.  Stop.  Again, you can't even...  You should just curse.  You can't even talk without cursing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, don't curse, all right?  Well, description fits, I think.  Dawn, you know what?  We don't want you to agree.  This is, you know, this is how I'm feeling today. 
[00:20:30]  An open forum.  Because someone needed attention in my family growing up, I didn't get to go to Disney World.  Oh, no, I didn't want to Disney World either.  What a shame.  Would you take me there?  I'll go.  Thank you, Dawn.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling some sort of Philly, the United States of Sciences.  We love Philly.  Thank you.  Go have an anti-war protest.  Buy an old muscle collar, accelerate to 150 on a nice back road.  That butt ends into a bridge abutment. 
[00:21:00]  No, see, that might not kill you.  You might just end up paralyzed.  All right.  Well, you could find a chair that Nicole's going to sit in and just lay on it real quick.  I'm sure that would do the job.  Hey.  Look who's on line six.  Richard, Jenny.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Richard, Jenny.  I got a call from New York.  You guys are trashing my material and trashing me and accusing me of all these horrible things.  What?  Who said that?  I got a call from New York. 
[00:21:30]  Was it Rich Voss?  No, it wasn't Rich Voss.  Hey, Richard.  We got the CD of your latest material on terrorism and what's going on in Afghanistan.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Really?  It was the worst stuff I've ever heard in my life.  Opie, I kind of liked it, Opie.  I don't understand why you're getting like this.  And you knew it was bad when you were doing it because then you went for the cheap applause saying, you know, we should rebuild the Trade Center.  And then you got your first applause of the CD.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  What are you trying to do?  Well, I was trying to, you know, I was trying to do material about the World Trade Center.  Well, now you're passing it out to radio stations and we played it and we barely commented.  We let the material speak for itself.  Right.  It was horrendous.  Really?  You know, I heard you said it wasn't original or something.  No, we didn't say that.  No, that was Voss's material.  Yeah.  And then we were talking about Rich Voss.  Okay.  We said at least Richard Jenny's trying to write new material.  That's what we said about that.  All right.  At least you're trying. 
[00:22:30]  But then...  But you didn't like it.  No, it was horrible.  You thought it sucked.  People were calling up saying it sucked.  Are you getting big laughs on the road with that stuff?  Right now I'm headlining at New York, New York and Las Vegas and it's sold out every night  and people like it.  So it just goes to show you, you know, everybody's different when it comes to comedy.  But we really have a bigger problem than your stupid material.  What's your bigger problem?  You were in this studio, Richard, right?  Yeah.  And you had the chance to talk to Aunt Nye, right?  Yes.  And speak your mind, right?  You got it. 
[00:23:00]  And you did not do it.  And then you went on another radio show and then lapped someone's ass for the whole morning  as this guy was talking about shows out there that are clones.  Right.  You're a pussy.  You had the chance to say it to our face.  I'm a pussy.  I had a chance to say this to your face.  First of all, we talked during the break, okay?  Your people didn't know this.  We talked during the break and you said, oh, you know, we're just kidding around up here.  This isn't for real, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, we're just, this is what we do.  This is our show. 
[00:23:30]  You believe that.  You're so stupid.  We lulled you in.  Am I supposed to go on somebody else's show and understand you guys?  What am I supposed to do?  You're a pussy.  Why don't you speak your mind?  If you didn't believe what he was saying, then you should have said something.  But instead, you're like, that's right, that's right, that's right.  All right.  Let me see who's a pussy here.  Am I a pussy or are you a pussy?  You won't even mention.  You ripped off his act.  You don't do it as well.  Hey, Richard.  And if you're so insecure.  Hey, Richard.  Richard.  Oh, now you're saying that.  Why didn't you say it to our face when you're in the studio?  That's what I'm getting at. 
[00:24:00]  You had every.  Why didn't he say it to you?  You had every chance.  I didn't say it to him either.  If that's what you think of our show, you should have said it while you were sitting here.  Right next door.  Now you're going to tell me what I'm supposed to say on a radio show?  Why not?  I didn't say it on his show either.  I didn't mention your name on his show.  Oh, but you sat there all morning.  Why are you so insecure about it?  They went, no.  They're not, because we don't care.  Why is it so important to you?  You were lapping his butt.  I was lapping his butt.  Lapping.  Lapping.  Right. 
[00:24:30]  And that's why you played my material and made everybody call up and make fun of it for 20 minutes.  No one called up.  Because you're mad about that.  No, no one called up.  We didn't make it.  I heard a lot of people called up.  We didn't make anybody call.  You know, he sucks.  We don't like him.  We hate him.  No.  He's terrible.  Why do you have him on your show?  You know, then your spies are wrong, because that's not what we did.  Well, that's what I heard.  We said Richard Janney sent this CD of material.  Let's play it.  All right.  Well, let me just say, why is it that people like you don't?  Hold on.  I don't have any actual comedy talent. 
[00:25:00]  I have to get listeners by making fun of people like me who do have talent.  Yeah, you have a lot of talent.  It's obvious.  Hey, I don't do it by myself, dude.  I don't do it with buttons and noises and sound.  I don't need them, dude.  I don't need them.  Oh, yeah.  Is that what?  Platypus Man was great.  Platypus Man sucked.  I'll go with you there.  And it's a radio show.  Of course, you have other people involved, and you play sound effects and stuff.  What I'm getting at is I was very disappointed.  You begged to be on our show for a long time, right? 
[00:25:30]  I did not beg.  For Ron and Fez, you didn't beg?  Where's the begging?  I went to what's the station there?  You want me to get Ron and Fez?  Ron?  He was calling me every day and saying, you know, Richard really wants to get on.  We're like, I don't know if he's going to fit in with what we do, blah, blah, blah.  So we finally have you in, and we kind of got along after we messed with you in the hallway,  and then you came in.  Yeah, you wouldn't let me in the studio for two hours.  Because we don't need you to be, you know, to be funny.  We were funny on our own.  Okay, but it's not right to say that I begged.  I got Ron and Fez.  Holy!  I was a friend of mine.  I knew he knew you. 
[00:26:00]  I knew you guys had a big audience.  I'm in town to promote something.  I don't think any other comedian begged as much as you did to get on our show.  That is a fact.  I went to Ron, and I asked him, I said, go tell these guys you know me, and I'm funny,  and they'll put me on.  I was in town promoting something.  You got a big audience.  I wanted to be on your show.  How is that begging?  And then I just have a problem with you being a phony.  You're on our show.  We had kind of a good time with Ron Jeremy and all that.  I'm about to, that's the reason why we say it another way.  And, you know, you had the chance to say, oh, come on, that's hogwash. 
[00:26:30]  But you did it.  You just went with it because it probably wouldn't be good for your career to disagree.  I also had a chance to go off on you guys, and I didn't do that.  I didn't even mention your name.  I didn't even mention your name on the show.  They wouldn't allow it.  Oh, I didn't even know.  Well, I didn't know that.  I didn't know I'm not allowed to mention it.  I had a chance to go off and start saying all kinds of things about how you made me sit  in the lobby and all this other crap.  I didn't.  I just let it go.  You got to admit, you do have an influence from that guy. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, see, you had the chance to say it on our show.  No, no.  Everybody's influenced by somebody.  But how do you think your radio show would sound if I played it 30 seconds at a time  and had people call up and make fun of it?  No, we played the tracks as they were on the CD.  And you didn't like them?  It was bad.  Maybe it's not my type of humor.  Even if it was like the first two days after the show, you still think that material would suck.  First two days after the attack, no time to make it work, just first right out of the box, 
[00:27:30]  you still think it would suck.  Did you drive around L.A. with the CD in your car thinking it was really good,  and I can't wait to get it out to radio stations?  No.  Look at you.  Look at you, Ryan.  That's someone that sounds fun.  You know, and you're not the only radio station my PR people sent it to.  We sent it all over.  A lot of people played it.  You're the only one that took 40 minutes to tell us.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We didn't say how.  We just let the material speak for itself.  Yeah, we didn't tell people to call up or anything.  Yeah, like you guys aren't screening the calls. 
[00:28:00]  Like you don't have the guy there going, oh, here's a guy who hates him.  Let's put him on.  You know what?  I would have to go listen to the tape again, but I don't even think we put one person on.  Rich Voss we put on.  That was it.  Well, but that's my point, though.  Between stand-up and doing the radio, I mean, it's, you know, I don't have, it's a much harder thing to do stand-up comedy in a radio show.  I can't hang up on people or play noises over them.  I don't have seven people helping me.  It's just a more difficult thing to do.  And we can't go out on the air every day and say the same thing we said yesterday. 
[00:28:30]  That's true.  All I'm saying is next time I have a backbone.  And tell you that you suck right to your face.  Well, if that's what you thought, I don't think you thought that.  I didn't think that.  Until someone else was talking bad about us, and then you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wasn't, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you didn't even hear the show.  You're getting this third hand, aren't you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're getting this third hand.  Oh, no, everyone knows we listen every day, right?  Did you hear what I said?  It got back to us. 
[00:29:00]  You didn't hear what I said?  It got back to us.  It got back to you.  I could have.  In many ways than one.  I could have went off.  I didn't go off at all.  I spent two hours sitting in your lobby.  I had a chance to get even with you, and I didn't take it.  Oh, because we ended up doing good radio that day.  What I'm just trying to tell you is next time.  That was fun that day.  I got news for you.  I thought it went well.  Okay, but all I'm trying to say is next time I have a backbone, whether it's, you know,  you're not being treated right on our show, or if you're on another show, and you don't  agree with what the host is saying, have a freaking backbone, and don't worry about how 
[00:29:30]  it's going to affect your career.  Okay, look.  And you're standing with the show you're on.  Okay, but I don't have a backbone.  I'm a pussy.  You're not a pussy.  You have a backbone.  Oh, God.  I knew you were going to do that.  Next.  Everybody, Richard Jennings.  That's, those are the times I just like to sit back and watch obesity neurosis at work. 
[00:30:00]  You enjoyed it.  I just love sitting back and watching and going, oh, oh, oh.  It's just a bunch of phonies.  Bunch of phonies.  What?  All right.  What?  I would play the material again, but if we broke the CD. 
[00:30:30]  And I wouldn't say a word.  No, I, you know.  He's calling back.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  O.P.  Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  Effing Honduras.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What? 
[00:31:00]  What?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  What?  Right.  Where was Jim Norton during that segment?  I'm telling you, I'm not easy to make uncomfortable.  Huh?  I am not easy to make uncomfortable.  What got you?  What got you?  Oh.  That's just all of it.  I don't know.  We just take our friends of the show pretty serious.  There's not many guys that we have on this show on a regular basis that would do what he did.  Kiss our ass one day and the next morning, you know, go along with what's being said. 
[00:31:30]  I just want to bring up the fact that people are saying, oh my God, they were dumping out.  They were dumping out.  And everyone knows what they were dumping out of.  It is, I want to let everyone know, a blatant breach of the written word of our contract.  It's in our contract, the situation that we're dealing with right now.  We're dealing with a situation with the dump situation. 
[00:32:00]  We've been in meetings.  We've talked to our boss about it.  And for some reason, we are being denied certain rights that were given to us in the last contract we signed.  For some reason, we all read the contract.  We all had to sign them.  But for some reason, there's a part of the contract.  It was written in there.  It was one of the reasons we re-signed.  We re-signed.  That was then thrown away.  Just waved in front of us.  It's in the contract. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone read it on their side, on our side, lawyers, blah, blah, blah.  We signed.  And then they told us we couldn't do something.  The only reason I'm talking like this is because if I talk differently, they will dump out.  You know what I'm talking about.  It's in the God effing contract.  But for some reason, why did we agree to that if it was going to be taken away from us?  Exactly.  That doesn't make much sense, does it?  For some reason, I cannot approach any of the bosses with that written word in the contract. 
[00:33:00]  I show it to them.  For some reason, they go, no, it doesn't matter now.  Now it doesn't matter.  It was fine and dandy, but now it doesn't matter.  Now when certain things on this show are said, it gets dumped out of.  Not dirty words.  Not sexual content.  It's one thing that we say that gets dumped out of.  We cannot talk about this subject on this show, even though it's in our contract that we can talk about it. 
[00:33:30]  So, even with a situation like we were just talking with Richard Jenney about, where it isn't bashing this thing that we can't talk about.  It doesn't have anything to do with making them look bad.  We can't even comment on a situation through Richard Jenney about this thing we cannot discuss on this program without it being dumped out of.  And that is completely unacceptable.  Every time we meet about this, we are put off and given another line of bull crap as to why we cannot address this certain thing on our show without being dumped out of. 
[00:34:00]  And it's complete crap.  And that I am completely pissed about.  And believe me, again, it is not coming from this side.  It is not coming from this program.  It is coming from other places, which we can't even discuss, even though it's written. 
[00:34:30]  Vinny.  Hey, guys.  Contracts don't mean crap, obviously.  Well, if we screwed up and did something against the contract, you know damn well they'd be on our face about it trying to screw us over.  But, you know, something that we had to put in the contract and they agreed to, they could just grab that away and crap all over it.  And then a couple of months later tell us we can't do this, even though it's written in the contract and signed and addressed by both sides. 
[00:35:00]  But for some reason now, that's been taken away.  Frank, on line 10, do contracts not matter?  I don't know.  Well, Frank, yes, they don't matter.  They do not, absolutely do not matter.  When you have certain people that work for this company, their word is stronger than a contract.  Their word, when they go to upper echelon of this company, it is stronger than a contract that was signed by both sides. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, we know why.  We can't even discuss that.  Right.  Vinny.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I don't like to interrupt Anthony when he's on a coherent rant.  It's very rare.  What's up, Vinny?  Opie, what's wrong with you?  Huh.  I'm a fan of both shows.  Dumped out of that. 
[00:36:00]  Dumped out of that?  Yeah.  See how ridiculous it is?  You know what?  Hold on, hold on, Vinny.  Vinny, they dumped out of that.  That's not what this is about.  It's the problem we had with Richard Jennings after he left our show.  That's all we're dealing with.  But Opie, when he first came on your show, the first time when you guys made him uncomfortable as heck.  Right.  You seem to know that he had been a guest on another radio show.  All right, Vinny.  Now you're looking way into it.  No, that's not true.  No, no.  It had nothing to do with that.  That is not true whatsoever.  Really?  It was what happened after we thought we all had a good time. 
[00:36:30]  By the end of the show, we truly had a good time with Richard.  Ron Jeremy was in here.  It was the day that Ron was doing stuff with Stalker Patty for U2 tickets and cash, okay?  Yeah.  And by the end of it, we're shaking hands, taking pictures like, hey, Richard, thanks for being a good sport.  It was fun, blah, blah, blah.  You see the way Jim Norton didn't say anything during the Richard Jennings stuff?  That's how Richard Jennings should have acted.  Don't say anything.  I got to tell you, now that I've seen what they dump out of, forget it. 
[00:37:00]  I think back everything I said.  It's ridiculous.  Believe me.  It's a war you can't win.  And it is a blatant, blatant disregard for our contract.  Sue him.  Well, we probably could.  All right, Vinny.  Rob, you're next.  What's up?  Obi, you're way off on this one.  Hello?  I'm listening to you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You wanted me to jump down your throat?  I could do that.  No, no, please don't jump down my throat.  No, but listen.  Listen, I heard both, right?  Right. 
[00:37:30]  And he's doing exactly what Norton did.  He didn't say anything.  He just sat there.  I mean, and it wasn't like a big deal.  It was a two-second thing.  And that was it.  It wasn't like a rambling on like you guys are doing.  You're dragging us down.  Well, you guys are now because you're calling about it.  I know.  I had to voice my opinion.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I like both of you guys, but...  Let me tell you something, my friend, Rob.  We have a lot of guys in the studio.  I'll name a few.  Brewer, Norton, Jeff Norris, Rich Voss, Jay Moore. 
[00:38:00]  I thought you were talking about comedians.  Lewis Black.  I'm missing a few.  But you know what?  Those guys would defend us to their death.  That's how loyal they are to our show.  You know?  And we just...  It's more not even loyal to the show.  We're just friends.  And they do the right thing when stuff comes up.  Let's just put it that way.  All right?  All right.  Whatever you're a dick.  There you go.  Don't be pussy.  Yeah, look.  Chris from White Plains doesn't understand the situation whatsoever. 
[00:38:30]  Don't be pussies.  Keep saying it until they run out of dump.  F them.  No, you don't understand.  When they run out of dump, he will turn a key.  There is a key in there.  He turns a key, presses a button, and music plays.  Music plays.  That's what happens.  We go to a song until the dump builds back up.  Then he will shut the music off.  And have more dump.  And if we keep saying it and saying it, it does nothing for the show. 
[00:39:00]  You don't hear it.  Don't be pussies.  That's what it is.  Right.  Don't be pussies.  Have them dump out of the show until it goes to a song.  I am not happy with that situation.  And I let Ken Stevens know about it at the meeting, but there's nothing he can do about it either.  No.  It goes way higher than that.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah, I know.  He's stuck in the middle.  Howard.  Yeah, how are you doing there?  All right.  Yeah, I'm sorry to be a dead horse, but first of all, I just want to tell you what I learned 
[00:39:30]  today before you ate me.  If they dumped out of your name, I'm walking down the hall and I'm going to punch him in  the face.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right, go ahead.  I just want to tell you what I learned today before we get into, before you start bashing me.  Go ahead.  You can say what you want.  That said, man, you called the guy a douchebag.  You didn't give him a chance to respond.  I have no idea what the guy did or didn't do it here.  But the bottom line, us fans out here, you know, we've all been pissed at our bosses.  Either stand up, be men, or get off the air. 
[00:40:00]  That's all I got to say.  All right.  Thank you for your opinion.  Well, Howard, that was great.  Thank you.  All right.  Everyone's entitled.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, this is my point.  I think you're right, but you have to admit that the entire radio genre that you're in  is due to somebody.  That's all I just credit everybody.  Dude.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm so sorry to say it.  And it just starts that argument again all over again. 
[00:40:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  If that's what you believe, fine.  That's okay.  No, no, no.  Jenny shouldn't eat.  Everyone is.  I'm sorry.  Everyone has.  I'm a big pussy.  I'm sorry.  Everyone has their influences, especially in entertainment.  Whatever.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  Right.  Isn't that what Richard Jenny just said, though?  What?  Isn't that what Richard Jenny just said?  No.  He said everybody has their influences.  Yeah, after it was pointed out to him that everyone has their influences.  Because I said he was saying something completely different.  And we said, who are your influences?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  I'm sorry.  It wasn't even about that.  The one thing has nothing to do with the other.  I was bringing up one thing that I'm pissed off about something that's in the contract.  And the Richard Jenny thing is completely different.  There you go.  Hey, Madison's here, Anthony.  Yes.  Let's bring Madison in.  The lovely and talented Madison.  Helping us with the Shave Bush for Bush campaign, Anthony.  She's showing her patriotism today. 
[00:41:30]  Where is she?  Here she comes.  Madison is such a good soldier for us.  Hey, Rick.  Who is on?  She always shows up.  Who is on the hotline?  No one.  No one.  No one.  You sure?  Yeah.  You're just being...  All right.  No, that's just one of the neighbor's bosses.  What?  One of the shaving girl's bosses.  Oh, okay.  Hi, Madison.  How are you?  Hi, sweetheart.  How are you?  I've been better.  You look lovely.  Thank you.  Anthony, it's Madison.  I see.  From Privileged Gentleman's Club in Manhattan.  She's quite the trooper.  She always shows up to help out the show. 
[00:42:00]  Nice.  Damn.  Are you ready to get this done?  Whether it's asparagus in Das Diemper, or shaving, or the wiffle ball, that challenge.  Are you nervous?  No, not at all.  I remember that very vividly.  I've been through worse.  The asparagus.  You were a virgin, a balloon knot virgin at that point.  Well, not anymore.  Not anymore.  See, we started a trend with asparagus.  She's up to carrots now. 
[00:42:30]  Asparagus.  That was great.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So now, what are you sporting, as a matter of fact?  Let me take a look.  Stand back a little, because I can't see.  She's showing you her T-shirt.  That's all we're talking about.  Go over there.  Go over there, like, back a little.  Now, let me see what type of hairstyle you're sporting anyway.  Yeah.  Could you move that box?  Not you, Madison.  That one that's in the way.  There we go.  Can you see?  Let's see.  What?  You're done?  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:43:00]  No, she needs a cleaning.  Let me see.  She needs to be clean.  Clean.  You're, that is, that looks done.  So we haven't gotten her on the table yet.  She needs an edge trimmer.  Exactly.  She does?  Just a little edge trimming.  A little cleaning up.  Yeah, yeah.  When was the last time you shaved?  She just needs a little.  This morning.  This morning.  What do you got?  She's completely taken care of.  I'm looking.  I shave every day.  That's baby ass smooth. 
[00:43:30]  Thought she needed the sidewalk done, but this is, no.  No.  Well, all right.  Well, sure.  Maybe get a touch-up out there.  All right.  We'll get a touch-up with Madison.  Every little bit counts.  When we take a break, Madison, we'll get her touch-up and we'll play What Do We Learn  Next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the kind of show where you can feel out your sister.  Feel out your sister.  Feel out your sister.  Opie and Anthony.  I mean, you guys are awesome.  It's like I gotta listen to you.  It's like a drug. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Lots going on.  We got Madison outside the studio helping us out with shaved Bush for Bush, Anthony.  Hey, Rick, you out there?  Probably.  I don't know.  All right.  And we're going to play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today, okay?  Yes.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Ed from Brooklyn said,  I learned that no comic bridge is too unstable for Jim Norton.  That's funny.  Yeah, there's a lot about Norton today. 
[00:44:30]  Norton's back.  Spork from PA.  Today I learned Norton is a mute.  Bud Dwyer from Hell.  I learned today that suicide attempts are just cries for help.  Rick.  You.  Oh, man.  That's loud.  What's going on out there?  Sorry about that.  We know what's going on.  Madison is...  Madison is here to support the cause. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Thank you, Madison.  Are those ladies sober enough to do the job?  Yes.  I hope so.  Absolutely.  I've had nothing to drink.  All right.  Anthony, Jersey Gary.  I learned today on the ONA show,  Anthony's idea of a good movie is blah, blah, blah,  shoot someone with a phaser.  I learned the better a dead actor you were,  the more applause you get,  and that no DNA under the fingernails is reasons for major applause. 
[00:45:30]  Mm-hmm.  Also, Rumsfeld rocks.  Madison, how are you doing?  Oh, this feels good.  And she's got her T-shirt, Anthony.  We had T-shirts made for the cause.  No, see, shave your Bush for Bush shirts  with the American flag on it.  And you can see Madison at Privileged Gentleman's Club,  23rd and 11th Avenue.  She's one of the regulars there.  She's great.  She's so hot.  We love Madison.  Big Josh from the city.  I learned today, fat, bipolar, Mormon, virgin sluts, 
[00:46:00]  always funny, Norton rules.  The only time Anthony wants to see Harry Potter  is when he's standing in a shopping bag in the men's bathroom.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Don writes,  the only thing better than Opie fighting with a washed-up comic  is Norton trying his hardest not to tell Richard Jenny  to trip and fall onto a hyperdemic filled with AIDS.  What's going on out there?  It didn't take long.  Did they even need the shaver-shaver?  They need, like, a razor blade. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we're on the razor right now.  Let's talk to the hair cutters.  Everything is going great.  She's just about done.  There was no need for clippers, though, right?  No, not really.  Just a little clean-up.  A little off on top.  Kevin, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, hey, Mom.  I learned three things today.  I learned how to prevent people from sitting in front of you  in a movie theater soda on the seats.  That's right.  I learned that Freddie Prinze Jr.  should take some advice from the old man. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And finally, I learned that George Lucas is cranky, fat,  and has a weak chin.  Very good.  Take it easy, guys.  I guess we did have fun today on the show, huh?  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mo-Mon.  Mo-Mon.  Mo-Man.  Mo-Man.  What's up?  Mo-Man.  Deep and back don't matter.  What?  And Opie missed Disney World because someone needed attention.  Oh, you heard of that one?  You are good to go.  Oh, I thought I said that during rehearsal.  And you're a great sport.  All right.  Thank you.  Is she done?  I want to hear about that more.  Yeah, she's done. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Let's have her come in here and let's see the results.  I think it's going to look exactly like it did.  The boy after pictures are going to be the same.  Oh, Norton wants to see her ass.  Oh, God.  Norton's working his junk.  She's working his mule.  Norton.  Looks like he's got a crowbar in his front pocket.  Thank you.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's take a look now.  Hold on, dude.  Let's back up a little bit and let's see.  What's wrong, Madison?  All right.  Well, it does look a little cleaner than it did.  They do a good job. 
[00:48:00]  And Norton wants to see your ass.  I see my butt.  Yeah, it'd be nice.  What do you think, Norton?  You like that?  It just makes you want to cry.  God, that's nice.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned there are no hot girls in West Virginia.  True.  Well, we don't know for sure, but that's what we're assuming.  I haven't been down there to look.  We're assuming a lot today.  And that's it? 
[00:48:30]  And I learned...  All right.  I'm going to cut my losses.  Very good.  Wow.  Derek, what's up?  He was trying to make one up.  Derek.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that fat Mormons are a three-six-pack lay.  Yep.  And bipolar means you like male and female polars.  Norton rules.  Norton rules.  Hey, Chris, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, guys, I got a question first.  When they run out of dump, did someone pull a .45 and point it at someone else and scream,  turn your key?  Turn your key, sir.  Listen, today I learned butt lapper Richard Jenney isn't even as funny as a deaf comic. 
[00:49:00]  Right, Norton?  And if you want to kill yourself, go right to the jugular.  I also learned a broken turkey neck would make Anthony cream.  Yeah.  And the Star Wars trailer sucked.  Hey, Chris, you're very funny.  You know, and Richard Jenney's looking for writers, so you want his number?  Yeah, maybe I should.  You got that number?  Very good.  Yeah, he claims he doesn't have writers.  Hello.  Yeah, well, he's a faggot anyway.  You want me to prove him wrong on that one, too?  Yeah, we should.  All right, later, guys. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you.  You know what she learned today?  Huh?  Please love me.  Blah, blah, blah.  Please love me.  Blah, blah, blah.  Sam, what's up?  Five minutes.  There goes the line.  Never underestimate the psycho factor in Jay Moore's head.  Oh, you're right.  Great.  You guys suck.  I only have two lines, and he's using one and getting big laughs.  God, her ass is nice.  All right.  Oh.  You like that, right?  It bugged me.  Bobby.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned three quick things.  Yeah.  I learned 5'5", 170 pounds. 
[00:50:00]  Is it on an obese chart?  No.  Richard Jennings' CD sucks.  Well, it wasn't a CD.  You know, we've got to stick to the facts.  Well, Connick sucks.  It was just some of his latest material on what's going on, and he figured he had to get  it out right away for the topical subject of the World Trade Center.  And he's been sending it to all the radio stations, and most of them playing it and enjoying  it, so.  Well, we don't.  And I learned one more thing.  Read the book before seeing the movie.  All right.  Good job.  Norton Rule.  Thank you, Bobby.  So you can discuss it in line.  I think we're done, huh? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Can I thank, real quick, the Art Asylum for providing me with this Ozzy Osbourne Bark at  the Moon doll.  I have to thank them.  Of course.  I want to drink out of somebody's mule for this.  This is phenomenal.  Big Kev, what have you got there?  Because I know, I see an Alice Cooper full size.  How big is that?  The guys at Art Asylum were nice enough to send over a bunch of stuff.  I am psyched, man.  And that's...  Got like an Alice Cooper doll.  It's about...  18 inch.  18 inches tall and really detailed.  Yeah, very.  The Gene Simmons one, cool.  The Gene Simmons one is from McFarlane. 
[00:51:00]  Where could the normal guy that doesn't have to get free stuff get it?  You can get the Art Asylum merchandise at Spencer Gifts.  Like 10 minutes.  And you can get the McFarlane stuff at almost every toy store.  Cool, man.  And I sent over a bunch of stuff.  Thanks, McFarlane.  Big ups.  Phenomenal.  Cool.  Thanks, Kev.  Sean.  Yes.  What's up?  Go ahead.  What I've learned today is at the end of the show, you should always clap.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Very good. 
[00:51:30]  All right, Sean.  Thanks.  Thank you.  And ladies, quick plug.  We've got to get out of here.  Sure.  Thank you so much for having us and visit us at NewYorkHairRemoval.com.  All right.  Thank you.  And it looks lovely.  She had a kid seven months ago.  You can't even tell.  Big ups to you.  All right.  Norton had one last night.  What do you want to give away?  Hey, we've got a bunch of tickets to see Jim Brewer in Philly and in New York.  Okay?  Cool.  Depending on where you live, give us a call.  Or stay on the line.  We'll take care of you.  And with that, thank you.  We'll see you guys tomorrow at 3. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, please.  You guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  Let's bring in the incest couch. </pre>
