<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed recounting of the hosts' experience at a SiriusXM gala celebrating Paul McCartney's performance.  They described numerous celebrity encounters, including Alec Baldwin (whose foot Opie accidentally stepped on), Kevin Bacon, Steve Buscemi, Jerry Seinfeld (referred to as a "nerd" for enthusiastically head-bobbing), Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Paul Simon, Martha Stewart, Will Ferrell, Lorne Michaels, John McEnroe, and securing photos with Keith Richards and Ron Wood (including one taken in a bathroom).  The hosts emphasized the surprisingly casual nature of their interactions with these A-list celebrities. The conversation then abruptly shifted to a furious rant about the abysmal performance of the New York Islanders hockey team, with Opie using highly offensive language to express his frustration.  A brief mention of an upcoming Foxwoods poker tournament was made before returning to the McCartney concert and mentioning Matt Damon amongst the attendees.

The show continued with a heated debate surrounding the suspension of New York Jets coach Sal Alosi for tripping a player. The hosts and callers dissected the video footage, speculated on Alosi's motivations, and compared the incident to other similar events in football history, such as the Woody Hayes incident. The discussion also covered the nuances of NFL rules regarding players going out of bounds, the New York Jets' poor performance (especially Mark Sanchez's struggles in cold weather), a story about 1100 Quebec City residents attending an Islanders game, a viral video of Russians bungee jumping, a Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly parody video, Miley Cyrus's salvia-infused video, Brett Favre's streak ending, and Ozzy Osbourne's minor car accident.  Kevin Hart was announced as an upcoming guest.  Vulgar and offensive language was used frequently throughout this segment.

Comedian Kevin Hart joined the show.  The conversation focused on his successful comedy tour, including sold-out shows and added performances.  Hart discussed his relationships with other comedians, including Keith Robinson, Patrice O'Neal, Colin Quinn, and Jim Norton, sharing humorous anecdotes often involving teasing and insults.  He recounted awkward celebrity encounters with Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, and Jerry Seinfeld.  Other topics included filming *Little Fockers*, his Gator Bowl performance, and his canceled ABC show, "The Big House."  A significant portion detailed the harsh but ultimately beneficial camaraderie and intense ribbing within his comedian peer group, particularly at the Comedy Cellar, including an anecdote about Jim Norton's aggressive reaction to a prank.

The final segment continued the discussion of Kevin Hart's career and past relationships, beginning with a story about a drunken urination incident in a car. This transitioned into a comparison of the New York and Los Angeles comedy scenes, focusing on the perceived differences in sensitivity.  Further anecdotes detailed Patrice O'Neal's antics (including an incident of masturbation), Bob Kelly being teased for his pants, and numerous "beatings" (physical and verbal) Jim Norton endured from the group.  The hosts recounted numerous anecdotes involving Hart, referencing his roles in projects like *Soul Plane*, and made numerous disparaging remarks about his physical attributes and comedic style, with Hart responding in kind.  The conversation covered his upcoming "Three Kings and a Heart" comedy tour, and included a story about Hart being caught masturbating.  The hosts discussed their history with Hart, the changing dynamics within their groups, and their conflicting feelings about his success.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for the Foxwoods Casino poker tournament and mentions of upcoming shows and social media pages.

[00:23:00]  Me too  I gave him twice that  I'm like here  It's a pleasure  Because he was trying to make some bucks  Yeah that's what it was for us  So as soon as I said  Look we'll report the guy  Then he slowed down  And goes okay you will  And of course we're not going to report the fucking guy  I just wanted to get home safely  Yeah  The roads were a bit icy  And this guy's battling it out  Battling it out  Yeah you don't want that on the icy roads  Bruce got us a car  You know the security  Springsteen  Huh?

With your Armani suit  Look at you  Wow I am a dapper motherfucker right there  Looking good  That's hysterical 
[00:26:30]  Radio personality  Anthony Cumia  Attends Paul McCartney's show  Ooh  Very nice  Look at me  My picture didn't make it online  I'm very hurt  Oh Jimmy  Abu  You know  You dress to impress  Yes  It was the tie that made it by the way  I had my  No it was the  I had my jacket  My suit jacket  Yes  You looked very good  You did  I felt dressy  You did  I felt fat  It just makes me look  God you fatso  I had different levels of dress 
[00:27:00]  That I brought in my suitcase  And then I decided  You know what  I'm going for it  You went all in  You went all in  Suit tie  The whole fucking schmear  Dress shoes from  Floorsheim  I wore a collar shirt  Ah  Did you have your sweats on from yesterday?  Falling off your ass  If it was up to me  You know what  This is what kind of fucking infants  roam around this place  Opie being one of them  He actually 
[00:27:30]  It sounded like  A parent yelling at a child yesterday  Oh Blatter  When Steve Blatter  Turned to Opie  And just goes  Would you pull your pants up?  And Opie's like  What?  What?  He's pulling his  Ripped up sweats up  I'm like  What the fuck  Is the boss telling Opie  To pull his pants up?  And you know that bothered me  For about three hours  After the show  I did it  I almost called him  To give me a piece of my mind  I was fucking cracking up  It's like  It's like a parent  And pull your pants up  I looked like  One of those rappers  You really did  It was around your ass 
[00:28:00]  My underwear was  Way above my sweats  Your fucking sweats  All ripped at the top  There's no elastic left  On those things  And it was falling down  Like to the bottom  Of your ass  Yeah  And Steve Blatter  Had to tell you  To pull your pants up  I dressed up  I hate wearing suits though  I'm not a fan of the suit  As far as comfort level goes  But you're not a fan of the suit  You look fine  And you look like a guy  That should be wearing a suit  I decided  For this event  It was a big thing  A night in a town 
[00:28:30]  Right there  Night in a town  Paul  What do you say Bill  What was your  Painting each other up  I mean every time  He did a Beatles song  I was out of my mind  But I think  Maybe I'm Amazed  Was a highlight  Ah that's great  Yesterday of course  Is a highlight  And then my  My other song  That I loved  Was Blackbird  Wow  That was amazing  Just him and a guitar  Yeah  Brought out the guitar  Front and center  Just doing Blackbird  I loved  Can you find a good version of that  Maybe we can go to break with it  Is the show in the system  Maybe we can play it off  Oh we're not allowed to do that 
[00:29:00]  Well we'll play a bootleg  Fucking version  We're not allowed to do that  Let's go bootleg  Find a good version of Blackbird  We'll play a little piece  Going into the break  I love  What was your favorite  Really  What were your favorite  Wait we're not allowed  To play anything  Holy shit  Well the bootleg stuff  Or the stuff that was recorded  Can you play a little taste  Of the bootlegs  I think because  It's bootleg  Okay let's see 
[00:29:30]  God  We didn't so not get it  Whatever  Talking about the Paul McCartney show  You play just a little taste  Here and there  Well they probably  And then it gets people pumped  For the rebroadcast of the show  They probably have plans  You know what  For it  Or they probably made an arrangement  You know what  They have a version of Blackbird though  Don't we  A version  The original version  It doesn't sound that much different  From the way he sang it last night  Let's play that whole song  Going into break  Why not  What were your highlights  As far as songs go 
[00:30:00]  I gave you my three  Maybe I'm Amazed was great  Yeah  That sounded fantastic  Yeah yesterday  Let It Be was great  Yeah Let It Be  Yeah Let It Be was really good  Yeah we heard Let It Be  Yeah  From the guy  From the guy  Not some guy  I told Ann  Like a lot of these songs  You've heard a million fucking times  In bars and stuff  And other huge bands  Doing Beatle covers  Yeah  And then you had to  Keep reminding yourself  That's the guy that wrote this shit  And he's playing it  In front of only 1300 people  Dude him singing  We had amazing seats  They gave us  Great fucking seats 
[00:30:30]  We were close  I loved him singing  Yesterday  At Let It Be  It was like  The whole thing was  Fucking tremendous man  Yeah  What a tremendous  I thought that  Watching a Beatle  Sing Beatle songs  And Ann  And leaned over another time  And said  Can you imagine  How you know  Some of his musicians  Are just guys  And all of a sudden  They wake up one day  In their careers  And realize  They're now going to be  Performing with Paul McCartney  Yeah  Who were those guys  Were any of them  Old bandmates  From the Wings days 
[00:31:00]  Or any of that stuff  I don't think so  They didn't look  That  They didn't look  Old enough for that  The keyboard guy did though  Yeah he kind of looked  He was an old bald guy  That kind of looked  Out of place  But man could he play  The drummer was great too  I thought  That drummer was  Fucking badass  Yeah his band  Was really  Was good  Yeah  I have a feeling  Those guys have  Some credits on their own  The band members  Oh I'm sure they do  In order to play with them  But yeah  Just the thought  That as kids growing up  They were probably  You know  Listening to the Beatles  And not knowing  Hey I'll be playing  With that motherfucker  Oh you got answers 
[00:31:30]  Already to that question  Look at the seat  It's when Danny's  In that seat  Oh Sam  You're useless  They're all  Lifelong musicians  Yeah just  Studio guys  Studio guys  Studio guys  Guitar player  Worked with McCartney of course  But also Cat Stevens  Miley Cyrus  Miley Cyrus  Brian Ray on the rhythm guitar  He's worked with  Santana  Joe Cocker  Smokey Robinson  Oh that was what I wanted to say too  It's like those guys  The hierarchy of who looks up to who 
[00:32:00]  Is amazing  Like  Everyone looks up to McCartney  Like the Stones guys do  Although those guys are like friends  I mean they're like  You know me and Bob  Where they hang  Mick Jagger doesn't look up  To Paul McCartney  Because he wasn't there  It's true  He's probably out fucking  At the David Lynch thing  Down the street  Fucking  The metal guys  All worship McCartney  But McCartney  If he could jam with anybody  He probably would have  Got Little Richard  And fucking  That's probably  Who he would have  Because those  British guys  And Keith Richards  Is the same thing  They idolized 
[00:32:30]  Those black  Blues guys  And black rock guys  From the 50s  I thought he would  Bring some people out maybe  It's amazing how he didn't  He didn't head count  To like pat himself  On the back  With who was there  He's performed for the Queen  The Presidents  It just didn't matter to him  And what were your songs  Jimmy did his  Yeah that was pretty much  The same  Those were  Yeah yeah  I just liked when he slowed it down  His voice  The hits are fucking great  His voice sounds even more amazing  When he slows it down  You know  Yeah  Right 
[00:33:00]  He's still got it  He's still got it  Oh sorry  My computer just decided  It won't  Go fuck yourself  Congratulations to the company  Fucking an event  That it went off  Even with the fucking mistake  That happened with the sound system  It didn't matter  It got fixed  It can only mean  That the Foxwoods poker tournament  This Friday  Will be a disaster  You know what  That's gonna be a star studded event too  Yes star studded 
[00:33:30]  Star dudded  Oh is everything gonna go wrong  At Foxwood  If you wanna come  Just to watch this spectacle unfold  Because in our lives  Two things in a row  Never go well  Never  And it was  And Brewer by the way  Was very happy  We talked about the show  At AC  For real  He was like  I can't believe how fucking  Great it's doing  Yeah  Tickets for the late show  Are on sale for January 15th  This Saturday  Everyone's gonna be down there  Of course 
[00:34:00]  Myself Jim  David Tell  And Bill Burr  I'm gonna go check that out  You got it dude  And they want you to come down  Hey  They just showed on TV  That Matt Damon  Was at the thing  I heard he was there  But I didn't see him  Was he actually there  That's what they're saying  They just showed a highlight on TV  Thanks Chuck  Oh I did not see him  I didn't see him  I didn't see him  At the arrivals  That is one  I didn't see any photos either  That's a once in a lifetime thing  Right there  That happened last night  We've got  We've been fortunate  Over the years  To get to do a lot of cool stuff  But that's my number one  Easily 
[00:34:30]  Ain't many things  Keep me in the city  That's for sure  You know  Dude  That was one of those  Yeah you gotta see a Beatle  And especially Paul  You know  I'm not going to see  Fucking Ringo's all star  Crap thing  No  But McCartney playing at the Apollo  Yeah  And that was the first  That was the first time  He's done that  Was that his first Apollo  Yeah  He was fucking  Very  What's the word  Reverential  He had some reverence  For the Apollo  He said for us British guys 
[00:35:00]  This place is everything  That probably was  The whitest crowd  That's ever been in the Apollo  By the way  I don't think  I saw  More than five black people  In the crowd  Roland said that  When he went to the sound check  And Troy did get into the sound check  I think  Oh really  And he said that he did a lot of  Buddy Holly songs  Because again  For those guys  Watching Buddy Holly do the Apollo  And I guess  Whenever he did it in the 50s  I mean that was a huge thing  Not only did Troy go to the sound check  He went to the show  Oh he did 
[00:35:30]  But he did a show  Roland  Roland actually  Went to the  Roland just told me this  And went to the  The sound check  And then decided  To kind of hang outside the Apollo  And of course  Roland  People don't believe us  When we say this  But he really doesn't own  A winter coat  And it was fucking freezing yesterday  Fucking freezing  It's 20 degrees right now  In New York City  Which is really cold for us  I know it gets a lot colder  Where you're listening  But um  Roland was standing outside the Apollo  It's kind of snowing a little bit  And it's just fucking freezing 
[00:36:00]  The wind is howling  Because the temperature is dropping  And the guys  Were so amazed  That he's just standing there  In a t-shirt  That they put you what  In the front of the line  To get a ticket  Last night  How did that work out for you?  People were just like  Staring at me  Like where do I stand  So I just started  Standing in front of the line  And got in  Roland just has  Was Troy with you?  Yeah  Roland just has that thing  Where he will always  He knows how to figure that out  A certain je ne sais quoi  And I mean this with  Really affection for you  But Roland's like a germ 
[00:36:30]  Like he just  He just  Winds up places  But uh  Yeah  I got you  He was texting me  I was happy that you got in  But I didn't know where you were  I was up top  It was a great show  Oh you went up?  Yeah  I don't care where I sit  How did it look from up top?  It looked fine  It wasn't a big place  Because everything leans forward  What a great venue man  Fucking great venue  Someone wants to know  Who were the celebrities  That had better seats than us?  Pretty much everyone  Will Farrell was sitting behind us  Was he behind us? 
[00:37:00]  I saw him  I didn't uh  Mad Dog Russo was right in front of us  There was six of us too  Martha Stewart and like I said  Her daughter were right in front of us  Deepak was right in front of us  Oh that choice  Trying to think who else was in our area  Brewer was right to my left  Uh  Literally the Stone  The Stones were across the aisle  Literally three rows in front of us  It was that close  They were right there  That close  Seinfeld was in his row  Chris Rock and Ben Stiller  On the other side next to Stern  Seinfeld was dead center  With George Wallace  Looking like a nerd  Looking like a nerd 
[00:37:30]  It really was a uh  They took good care of us  Everything was even  Like you didn't feel like  Slighted  It was just great  They were trying to get the show  Sat together  And they got us all in the same row  And it was just fucking great  It's all good man  Really great night  Yeah  Great night for the company  Yeah you gotta give it to them  You know  Um  It worked  Did we see Howard  Yeah  Uh  Ant and Jim saw Howard  Yeah  We said  We were talking to uh  When he came in with his crew  Yeah well he just came in with his wife 
[00:38:00]  We just said hi  As he was  He was walking by  Just getting into his crew  Yeah  He was like hey  I  I'm  You know hey  We work in the same building  I mean Christ  And then I  I  I had a chat with him  At the Borgata once  At you know  The poker tables  Um  But you know  He's  He's  Too  He's always been a  To himself kind of guy  So  Just walks by  I've never actually met him  In hello once  I'll tell you one thing though  It must suck to kind of be shy  In your personal life 
[00:38:30]  Which I believe he is  And be that fucking tall  Cause when he comes in a room  Every head turns around  And goes like  Oh Howard  You know  It's like  There's no mistake in  That it's him  Either that or it's  It's a gag from like the 40's  And it's one guy  On another guy's shoulder  With an overcoat  Jesus Christ  Who the fuck are those two  Oh it's one person  He really  You could literally see him  From across the room  Yeah yeah  He's a massive dude  He really is  That's really funny  And then  I was talking to Gary 
[00:39:00]  About his book  And how  Every TV show he's on now  He has to look like  He's the consummate author  He wears author clothes  And grew the author beard  And everything  It's like his agent told him  That he's gotta  Get a certain look  And lose like  30 pounds  Yes and crush your legs  And do this to your chin  Yeah  Rub your chin  Rub your chin  A little bit  And stuff  But  It was cool  They were all great  People  People are just tuning  And you gotta listen  To the replay  They wanna know  About Jimmy's pictures  They wanna know  About the bathroom pics 
[00:39:30]  We can't go over this  All day  We just did the whole thing  We came out of the box  Swinging today  I'm gonna twitter  My first Keith Richards picture  Which I actually like better  It's a great one  The color behind us  The color behind us is  There's a beautiful red wall  It's just a really weird picture  The color behind it  His fucking face is just  I took it while we were walking  That is so him  That is a great photo  His hair  I was wondering  Do you think he does that  To his hair  Like on purpose  Or is it just something  No it's Keith Richards 
[00:40:00]  That guy has never done anything  On purpose  That's why people love him  But his hair is so out of control  He rolled out of bed  And said oh yeah  I'm gonna see Paul McCartney today  He puts a headband on  His hair sticks out  Out of the top  And he just doesn't  Keith Richards has never done  Anything on purpose  There's no fucking way  Keith are amazing  Are you reading his book at all  It's amazing  I read some of it  I started like the first  Couple chapters  He's great  It's gonna take forever  To get through this damn  Book of his but  Cole fucking Kane  Yeah  His hair looked like

[00:41:30]  I'm not  I'm  Ö  I'm not  I  I'm not  . 
[00:42:00]  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
[00:42:30]  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
[00:43:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  I have to just say this.  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  Cliff Lee said fuck you to your Yankees and I couldn't be happier today.  He certainly did in a surprise move because everybody thought it was between the Yankees and Texas.  Right.  Holy fuck, the Phillies jump out and that's it.  I guess they're saying that he signed for $30 million less to say fuck you to the Yankees.  That's not fuck.  Here's what that is.  He didn't want the New York media.  A lot of guys cannot handle New York and that's all that was.  He could not handle playing New York.  Yeah, fuck that faggy. 
[00:44:00]  I don't care.  Really?  You would have praised him if he signed with the Yankees today.  Well, he didn't.  So I'm not.  Finally a guy doing the right thing and not going for the Yankees bullshit.  It's the right thing.  Going to Philly?  Well, I don't know.  The right thing would have been to stay in Texas and show some loyalty.  No, he was with the Phillies too, man.  Oh, was he?  Oh, okay.  He likes Philly.  He knows Philly.  Yeah.  He knows Philly this Cliff Lee.  He's too gay to fucking come to New York. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  What's the matter?  You can't take it?  You don't want to take the prize?  Maybe he realizes that the Yankees are on the downside.  Oh, what do you want to do?  You just want to come in and kick the Yankees ass every time you pitch?  Oh, wait.  That didn't sound good.  I think you're going to have a few lean years for your team.  I think this is the beginning of the end, and then there's got to be the rebuilding phase  kind of a thing.  I think you're going to have a few lean years as we move forward.  A few lean years? 
[00:45:00]  The team's getting a bit gray.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate when they see that.  The team's getting a bit gray.  I hate when they see that sports.  I've never heard that.  Your team's turning blue.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You're fucking dead.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What are the Islanders up to?  I told you.  What are they up to as far as win-loss in a row?  We should get the audio when the hockey season started and me praising how the team looks  good and stuff.  Boy, was I wrong.  Last night, the Islanders lost 5-0 to the Predators. 
[00:45:30]  5-0.  And I'm losing track, but I do believe that means they've lost 20 out of the last 21 games.  This is unbelievable.  How do you lose 20 out of 21 games?  This is unbelievable when it comes to hockey.  It really is.  Stunned.  20 out of the last 21 games.  They've only won 5 games this season.  I was telling Ant before the show, if you double their point total, they would still  be in last place in every division.  So just double their points.  And they would still be in last place. 
[00:46:00]  Still last place.  They are beyond bad.  They have 15 points on the season.  The Devils, who are having a shit year, have 18, I think.  And then the next team has like 20, I don't know, I want to say like 28 maybe, 26 points.  They are the worst team by far this year.  They really have just exploded.  And Garth Snow, who's the GM, continues to keep his job.  Charles Wang doesn't give a fuck.  He's just happy he's not in jail.  Hey, Wang! 
[00:46:30]  Wang's happy he's not in jail like his partner is.  I've read a whole article on that.  He got his partner for all sorts of shit.  And they didn't get Wang, supposedly, because he didn't write emails and, you know, kept  his...  No record of his...  There's no record of...  Shenanigans or chicanery?  Of his shenanigans.  I'll just put it that way.  That's what this one writer was saying.  Yeah.  So he's just happy that he's not in jail.  He don't give a fuck about the Islanders and the organization.  Next is Toronto with 26 points.  Okay.  Yeah.  So the Islanders have 15. 
[00:47:00]  Wow.  15.  Devils have 18 points.  They're just as bad as the Islanders, pretty much.  And then it's 26 points.  It's the third worst team.  They're actually tied.  Toronto, Maple Leafs, and Florida are tied with 26 total goals.  Now, go to the top of the division of the Islanders' division there.  How many points does the leader have?  44?  Pittsburgh has 44.  And we have 15.  Do you understand how bad this is?  Very.  Pittsburgh is also on a 12-game win streak.  Well, Pittsburgh, they look ridiculous this year.  Once a fucking game. 
[00:47:30]  Is that the team you're supposed to jump on?  If you're a bandwagon jumper?  Uh, yeah.  Go.  Because I bleed Pittsburgh.  What are their colors?  Uh, they got a little, like, um, like gold.  Gold.  I bleed Pittsburgh gold.  Kind of silver, I think.  And silver, too.  And a little black, right?  Is that their official colors?  It's like just some...  I bleed whatever.  You're gonna be a Sidney Crosby fan.  Who?  We like to call him Cindy.  Yeah.  That's how we show them.  Ah, you show them.  We give him a girl's name as he's fucking kicking everyone's ass.  I have no idea. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  He's having a crazy year.  Who was the hockey player there last night?  There was some well-dressed hockey player from Toronto, I think.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did see him.  People were really fawning over him.  Yeah, he was a good-looking gentleman, as they say.  I don't know.  As he walked in.  Was he the guy with the beard kind of thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a goalie.  He looked like a GQ.  He looked like a GQ model.  That's it.  So, thanks for asking about the Islanders.  I so don't care.  And I know when you say that, it means you care.  I just don't care.  I've had it.  Yeah.  At this point, why bother? 
[00:48:30]  I'm leaning toward following the Flyers, because I got family down there.  Yeah.  Yes.  But that's stupid.  You don't do that if you're an Islanders fan.  But you also can't keep supporting a team when you know the people in charge don't give a fuck.  And I don't know if they're just playing it out so they can move or what.  I don't know what's going on.  But this is really bad.  And usually when a team is on such a bad streak like the Islanders, they usually fire the GM.  For some reason, they're not firing Garth Snow.  I don't know why. 
[00:49:00]  I have no idea.  Yeah, why is he keeping his gig?  And they fired the coach, who I thought, I like the coach, and the new coach hasn't done shit.  They blame the coach.  You think they're just waiting because it's over anyway.  So let them ride this out, this disaster.  And then next season, fucking clean house.  They should just move it in the middle of the night.  I wouldn't even care.  You want to do that whole fucking Baltimore thing?  Just put them out of their misery.  You know, I had hope for year after year after year. 
[00:49:30]  I've been a season ticket holder since we moved back to New York, I guess.  So when was that, 12 years ago?  Yeah.  12 years.  Every year I'm paying my, you know, for my tickets.  Still waiting for that drive for five, huh?  To drive for five.  I just want a team that's competitive and, you know, young team that's competitive that  maybe makes the playoffs.  Yeah.  12 years I've been sitting in those seats.  And every year they raise the ticket prices.  And they raised the ticket prices this year knowing they were going to put a shit team  on the ice.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Knowing that.  The fucking Coliseum's falling apart.  We've, we've done this bit, I guess, but it's just infuriating.  That's the only, it's the only sport I really, really like following.  I mean, I talk basketball and baseball and football.  Although I, I'm loving my jets too, and they're falling apart as well, but.  Yeah.  They're self-destructing.  Fuck, man.  I don't know.  Fucking move the team out of Long Island.  Or if they're going to figure out something in Queens, then do it.  Get people psyched again.  Well, I don't know.  That team is just sitting there rotting. 
[00:50:30]  The whole organization is sitting there rotting.  And I don't even blame the players because, yeah, I've been beating up the Islanders,  but this is what I can say to the players.  They're going to move on to other teams and have fine fucking careers.  Yeah.  Because that's what happens.  We, we let everyone go too.  But not Di Pietro.  You signed him for, for 15 fucking years.  You think they should just go to the, go the way of the whalers?  At this point.  Where it's just like, they don't even move.  They just.  At this point, whatever.  I.  Disband.  I don't want to use, I don't care.  Because then people go, that means you care. 
[00:51:00]  But whatever.  Do what you have to do, I guess.  That's it.  It's, it's so done.  Well, you just become a Ranger fan.  I'm living in Manhattan.  You don't think I've thought about it.  New York.  You catch the games right there.  The only way.  Fucking the garden.  The only way that would happen, the Islanders would have to be like the Kansas City Islanders.  The Kansas City Islanders.  The Kansas City Islanders.  I couldn't do that, because that rivalry is ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  The Islanders and the Rangers is ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's bad enough to take a peek at the Flyers, trust me.  Bad enough.  So you guys must be happy about the Lee thing? 
[00:51:30]  I'm not a, I mean, I'm, I'm not a baseball fan.  Yeah, you must know.  I finally admitted that.  You must know some people down there that are.  Oh yeah, they're, they're fucking.  So they must be happy.  Yeah, they're loving.  That pitching motherfucker.  They're loving that Cliff Lee's a Philly.  They got a great rotation though, man.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Nice rotation down there.  Fuck.  Sucks.  Enough about the hockey.  The Jets coach, Sal Alosi or whatever his name is.  He's so fired.  He should be fired.  Well, he's suspended for the rest of the year. 
[00:52:00]  Uh-huh.  Good.  $25,000.  And I'm sure this guy doesn't make a lot.  No.  I mean, he does okay.  I'm sure.  But suspended without pay for the rest of the year.  $25,000 fine.  They took all his keys away.  Everything.  They don't want him talking to anybody in the organization.  And then they're going to reinstate him as soon as the season's over, I believe.  Was he allowed to go to the Paul McCartney show?  Dude, how is he not just fucking fired?  He put his knee out and fucking hit a player on the field.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Fuck him.  The player was kind of out of bounds, though.  Yeah.  I think that's sort of saving him a little bit.  Is it?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Like he didn't fucking take the guy out when he was in the field of play?  I guess he was out of bounds and back in bounds.  But when he was out of bounds, that's when this guy...  You can see it right here.  Because there's a border between the field and where the coaches stand.  And he was in that white zone or whatever.  That's out of bounds.  It's out of bounds.  And then he leaned his knee forward.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  He kind of gave him a little forward knee thing.  Yeah.  Mmm.  So...  And Rex Ryan is going,  Hey, look, man.  The guy made a mistake.  He's trying to, you know, stick up for his guy.  He made a mistake.  That's not a mistake.  That's not a mistake.  He interfered with a fucking guy, a player running.  He stuck his leg out.  What do you think?  It should be fired?  Dude, I'm all for giving a guy a second chance.  But you fucking stick your knee out at a football player while he's running?  Fuck you.  That's pretty bad.  They gotta make a statement.  You know?  It's just like some things you give a guy a second chance for. 
[00:53:30]  But it's not like...  If he had accidentally done that, like been talking and then just backed into the player  like an asshole.  Right.  That's different.  Yeah.  But he didn't.  But he thought he could get away with it, too, because he kind of leaned.  It was so subtle.  Like, I don't think anyone's gonna see this.  It's so subtle.  He probably saw him and went, this guy is gonna come so close to me.  Like, this is one of those split second thoughts that only take a split second, but a lot of  information went through your brain.  Right.  He probably thought, this guy's gonna come so close to me, he might just hit my leg and 
[00:54:00]  trip.  Sure.  Subconsciously, put your knee out a little further.  That seems to me exactly what he did.  It's very similar to the perf switch we talk about.  Perf switch.  Right.  We all have those moments.  Yeah.  I've seen Bill Maher when he was on Comedy Central before he moved to HBO.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And I was in the stands and I just had this feeling like, I'm gonna jump over the fucking  railing and tackle him while he's doing a show.  It's like, I could do that.  I could do that right now.  Just jump over the rail and tackle him.  But something keeps you from not doing that. 
[00:54:30]  Keeps sane people from doing things.  When I was at the Jets game on Sunday, I saw the Super Bowl trophy.  The trophy.  And I was thinking to myself, I could grab this and run.  And then I start thinking about how I would do that.  And then, of course, whatever you want to call the switch, it never turns on.  You're like, what do you mean?  No, you're not gonna do it.  But you do think dumb things, right?  Danny just showed a clip of that and it really doesn't even look like he touched the guy.  It is a weird kind of play.  He touched him though. 
[00:55:00]  But it was like four frames where you could really see what was happening there.  Yeah.  And just odd.  It looks like he didn't even touch him.  Yeah, I think what's his name was kind of playing it up a little bit.  He's definitely playing it up.  He's laying there like when basketball players get fouled.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  No, he got him.  Just enough to knock his forward motion.  You think so?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You think if another player did that, he would have laid there that long? 
[00:55:30]  Come on.  Watch him.  Okay, he gives him a little knee.  But technically, the guy is out of bounds.  He's totally out of bounds.  Totally.  And he's not allowed to come back in bounds.  And he's hurt.  He's hurt.  He's laying on the ground hurt.  He was all right.  He hurt a fucking player.  He ended up okay.  No, no.  But I mean, just to do that.  Look, they won.  What do you want from me?  The fucking Jets looked horrible Sunday.  Look at this.  10.  10-3.  10-3 to Miami.  Wow.  Well, they ended up getting another field goal.  Wow. 
[00:56:00]  Jets are in trouble, man.  They have to play the Steelers now?  Fuck.  And I told you last year, I'm telling you, this Sanchez cannot play in cold weather.  Cold water would be very difficult.  Yeah, cold weather.  That's what this is about.  He's from Southern California, and the guy can't play in the fucking cold weather.  Yeah.  Like Brady can.  What's the over?  With what?  The Steelers game?  I don't know.  I think I'll take the over.  Do a little bet.  Over?  Why?  You need the other team to score two to get your over. 
[00:56:30]  I know the other team will just fucking romp.  Yeah.  The Steelers are going to romp.  Yeah.  It's going to be an embarrassment.  The Steelers at home?  Fuck.  It's going to be an embarrassment.  They're at home.  Oh, boy.  Let me say hi to Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  What's going on?  Hello, guys.  Hiya, buddy.  Hey, if you look at the footage on that one play, all the Jets nobody coaches were standing  right on the white because they were all pissed off that that guy had been running out of 
[00:57:00]  bounds on every kickoff and no one was throwing a flag on that guy.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Go back and look at the footage.  All the coaches are lined up right on the white.  They're never like that.  You know, I like your insight on this.  Yeah, you see them all completely lined up right next to each other right on the white.  So they've been pissed off.  Right.  And then finally this guy goes, fuck this.  Fuck this guy.  I'm not standing and watching this idiot do this again.  Hey, that's kind of funny.  Hey, wait, wait, Bill. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, he just frunkist.  He's dead.  I don't really know the rule.  I guess you can't go out of bounds and then back in.  Right.  I would assume.  Oh, there you go.  There's the conspiracy right there.  The fucking Jets coaches were pissed off.  All lined up like, don't fucking, don't you do it.  Fucking.  I like that.  Good.  Let me say hi to Johnny in Miami.  Johnny.  Yes, that is the rumor that the ref Ryan made his coaches and the inactive players stay  on that sideline so that the gunners can't go out of bounds and run down the sideline. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, so now if he did that and told them to do that and this guy, you know, puts a  knee out and gets in a little bit of a jam up, Ryan can't have him fired.  Rex is clean.  He's like, I told these guys to stand.  I like that.  Yeah, Rex is clean, but he didn't tell them to knee the guy.  Right, right.  But Rex said, look, we'll line up right on that white because this fucking guy's getting  away with murder and they're not calling it.  I like it.  It sounds like a great excuse.  Yeah.  That didn't that to me means he should absolutely be fired. 
[00:58:30]  It was a premeditated thing.  It wasn't like.  Of course it was.  The coaches were pissed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They never line up that close.  Look at his hands in his pockets.  He's just like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of those.  Like Adam, daddy, daddy, daddy.  Whoopsie.  No one's going to notice.  There's only 8,000 cameras.  More knowledge from Tony in Iowa.  Tony.  Knowledge.  Yeah.  That caller is full of shit.  It's not illegal to go out of bounds.  Punt coverage guys do it all the time. 
[00:59:00]  They can go out and come back in.  Yeah.  Okay.  See, I didn't know the rule on that one.  I like knowing the little intricacies.  All right.  So then why would the Jets coaches be pissed if he's doing something legal?  It's probably one of those things that are illegal, but it's like shady.  Oh, really?  Like, what are you doing?  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Hey, guys.  Remember the Woody Hayes incident?  Ohio State.  He stuck his arm out and clotheslined the guy.  Oh, yeah.  One of the most famous fucking football plays ever. 
[00:59:30]  Great one.  He got fired for that, by the way.  Well, I think you gotta.  I don't think you should be able to clothesline players as they're running down the sidelines.  Clothesline.  That does make the game really interesting, though.  It'll make a player second guess going down the sideline.  Right.  He just clothesline them.  Can we see the Woody Hayes thing?  It's just amazing.  What's up?  Woody Hayes.  See you Sunday, buddy.  Ooh.  Sunday.  Where are you going?  Uh, for Ghana. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, in January.  Okay, cool, man.  Yeah, that's still a month away.  Thank you, buddy.  Looks like people are very excited about the big show, Jimmy.  Yes, I'm happy.  They're already talking about it.  Here's the Woody Hayes thing, man.  This is just so worth watching every single time.  He's right on the sidelines and, uh...  Oh, God.  What the fuck is he thinking?  What was he thinking?  He choked him.  Yeah, he gave him a fucking throat punch.  Was he fired for that?  Uh...  The caller said, yeah.  Was he?  I don't even... 
[01:00:30]  I don't remember.  What?  I don't remember, to be honest.  Crazy old coot.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Sure, why not?  Let's say hi to Wilbur in Jersey.  Wilbur.  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Morning.  I read in the paper, going back to the Islanders, uh...  Uh...  1,100 people from Quebec City had bought tickets to the Islanders game and drove down because  they want a team.  And they want to take the Islanders back and get a franchise up in Quebec City. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Well, you know...  Oh, yeah?  Move them to Quebec City.  Take them out of the country.  Yeah, they bust down...  It was supposed to be about 1,100 fans.  I don't know how many actually ended up making it, which made the Coliseum look like there  were people in there.  And they were all just cheering because they wanted to show the league that they could support  a hockey team in Quebec.  It's like, look, look what we can do.  Yep.  Great.  So...  Speaking of hockey, too, there's a minor league team in Trenton.  Trenton, the Trenton Devils, and their mascot name is Scorch. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, really?  I had to think of you guys.  Good old Scorch.  Of course you have to.  It probably is Scorch, knowing how bad radio is going these days.  Of course, Scorch.  Uh...  Tony Newton.  Yeah, we got that answer already.  Uh...  Everyone's saying you could run out of bounds.  Okay, we got that on the air.  Yeah, thank you.  Yes.  Thank you for the information.  Uh...  Okay, yeah, let's say hi to Richard in Florida.  Hey, Richard.  Hey. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Morning.  Cheep, cheep, cheep.  Hey, uh, I know how Jimmy likes to watch, uh, crazy-ass videos online.  I really do.  Do you like crazy-ass videos?  I certainly do.  Jimmy likes the ones where they go up really high.  That's his thing.  Yes.  Well, I got one for you.  Uh, you guys need to go to ebombsworld.com and check out about the fifth video down.  You'll see the title.  It's called Russians Jump Off Building.  Have you seen this video yet?  I have not.  No.  It's absolutely insane.  Russians jump off buildings.  I believe it's a bungee cord situation. 
[01:02:30]  Is Jimmy going to get sweaty palms?  Probably not.  I handle these things much better now.  I handle these things much better.  Yeah, since the Stones and I have been talking.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on a second.  These guys are on a roof in Russia, I believe.  Chick slides off the roof on a bungee.  They play rough.  They play rough.  They play rough.  And they completely swings back not hitting the buildings.  Those Russians are fucking just nuts.  Well, they have nothing else to do.  Drink vodka. 
[01:03:00]  Dude, she's...  How did they not hit...  How did she not hit the building coming back?  Yeah, how did they know that she wasn't going to hit the building?  They didn't.  They didn't, right?  They're just taking a chance.  Sliding off something.  Sliding off the roof.  A snowy roof.  Free falls for about 50 feet, probably.  That's a scream of death, by the way.  Sure.  As she's falling, there's no difference between that scream and a scream if she had no bungee on.  Then she swings all the way out, and now she has to come back, and she doesn't hit the building.  No.  She's so lucky. 
[01:03:30]  Are they holding the bungee, or is it attached to something?  It's got to be attached.  It has to be attached.  How do we hold the bungee?  Do not need to...  It would be impossible to...  Russians are big.  I don't think they're that strong.  They're strong.  It has to be attached to something, anchored down.  I don't know what the insurance is for that.  Fuck.  That's an accident waiting to happen.  Yes.  I wonder if they tested that.  Do you think they tied something?  Yeah.  Just to see where it was going.  And what's that fucking building?  It's like some half-built, blown-out building.  From the war or something.  Yeah, some Cold War fucking lab. 
[01:04:00]  Even if they tested it, I mean, it could go wrong.  Yes, of course it could.  Oh, okay.  Her just moving one leg.  There should go...  They're sliding her down something.  You hear the fucking rope go...  Dude, it is amazing that she didn't crash into that building.  She should have cracked her skull open on the side of that building.  It looks like the bungee is attached way at the other end, right?  You think it is?  Yeah, it's right around there. 
[01:04:30]  Right there.  Across the building?  Yeah, way across the roof.  Not where she slid.  No, that would have killed her.  Yeah.  So they figured some of it out.  Ah, that's crazy.  They lowered their odds a little bit.  Crazy.  Of the rush kids.  Hey, thank you for that, Richard.  I think most people have seen that one.  That's going all over the place.  Ah, that's a good one.  Ah, yeah.  Can y'all believe that's a chick, though?  That's amazing to me.  That a chick would actually get up there and do that shit.  A Russian chick, dude.  Yeah, because they're a little nutty.  Because chicks are scared of everything. 
[01:05:00]  They're all sane.  Yeah.  They don't do dangerous things.  Hey, all right, guys.  Have a good day.  Happy holidays, guys.  Take care, buddy.  All right.  Bill in Connecticut.  Thank you.  Yeah?  Hi, Bill.  Go ahead, Bill.  How are you?  On that fucking punt coverage thing.  The guy can't go out of bounds and be the first guy to touch the ball.  That's it.  That's basically as simple as the rule is.  If he goes out of bounds.  Oh, okay.  Wait, what?  If he goes out of bounds and then comes back in, he can't be the first guy to touch the  ball. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You know, punters want to pump the ball down inside like the 10 and they run and try  to catch the ball.  You know, to down it inside the three.  Or tackle another player?  Is that what they're saying?  No, he can come back in and tackle him.  He can't be the first guy to touch the ball, though.  Can he go out of bounds and grab a drink?  And then come back in.  He can't.  He can't.  He can't?  Yes.  No, he can't.  Oh, so if the play is still going, he can go out of bounds, he could get a drink, heat  up at those bench heaters a little, and then back on the field?  Yeah.  Just curious.  As long as he's not the first guy to touch the ball, he can go out of bounds, get a 
[01:06:00]  picture with Snooki, who's at the game, and then come back in.  Yeah.  Can that happen?  Yeah.  Great.  All right, cool.  Now we know.  Now you know.  Everyone's saying, no, you can't.  He's a dumbass caller.  Oh, really?  Why don't we ever get things right on the show?  Because everyone will always say that whoever's on the phone giving us information is a dumbass.  It's the wrong guy.  Isn't it out of bounds for a reason?  Like, you can't go because it's out of the bounds.  It's out of the bounds.  There's bounds that you're allowed to be in, and if you go out of them, you're not in the 
[01:06:30]  bounds anymore.  Yeah, and if you go out of bounds, you're obviously avoiding people that are in your  way.  So that can't be...  I've played a lot of Madden.  I've never been able to run out of bounds with the ball and then run back in with the  ball.  Because Danny's played Madden.  Madden.  Madden.  Madden.  Madden.  It's better than anybody else has at this point.  True.  Madden.  Madden.  Madden.  I'm obsessed with this. Rocky. Hey, Ruck.  All right. Here it is.  If you get pushed out of bounds, 
[01:07:00]  you have to try to return  to the field of play as soon as possible.  If you don't, it's a penalty.  It's that simple. What does  soon as possible mean? Wait, wait, wait. Pushed out of  bounds? What if you  run out of bounds?  You're not allowed to. You're not allowed to run out of bounds  on your own. What does soon as possible  mean? As soon as possible?  Is that in the rule book?  Well, what it's supposed to be is you're not supposed to be able to run.  And when do you think  you should run back in bounds?  As soon as possible! 
[01:07:30]  When do you think  maybe you should come back in bounds?  Yeah.  Rocky, go ahead.  Sanchez is not a good cold weather quarterback  because he's from California, but Brady is.  Where's Brady from?  Yeah, I get it, but  fucking  he doesn't look good in the cold weather.  I understand that, but for some reason  Brady understands  playing in the snow  and the fucking ice  and Sanchez does it.  Well, Brady had four years  in Michigan.  Did Sanchez not fall apart 
[01:08:00]  at the end of last year as well  when it got really cold?  Oh, yeah, well  it was in Cincinnati.  Remember the Cincinnati game?  It was like four degrees out.  Sanchez played pretty well in that.  I got bad news.  Sanchez may be another  Tony Romo.  Another guy who has  great moments,  but deep down  it has been bitten  by the bum bug.  Don't even say that.  Garbage.  Hey, Rocky, it's my dumb theory.  Hey, Rocky.  I'm not saying I'm going to run to ESPN.  Hold on to whatever you got to.  Hold on to whatever you got to.  I'm a Jet fan too.  I'm trying to.  All right, I'm not going to run to ESPN 
[01:08:30]  with my theory.  It's a stupid fucking theory  that I'd throw out there.  You know what I'm fucking  going to pull for here?  Yeah.  I hope the Jets  organization listening.  Yeah.  Bring back Vinny Testaverde.  Oh, shit.  Atta boy.  One more time.  Bring back Vinny.  One more time.  Come on, Vinny.  Rocky, I'm hanging in there, man,  but the team seems like  they're fucking frayed.  There's three games left.  We'll see what they're made of now.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll see.  Yeah, we'll see.  How they pull it off.  You do realize they lost  to the Dolphins at home  and didn't score  a fucking touchdown, right? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's really fucking bad.  But they beat the Patriots  a week too.  It's a week-to-week lead.  Dude, it's all they do  is let their fans down.  The whole organization  has let their fans down  for fucking decades.  It's all they do.  They won't even give them  a home stadium.  Makes me sick.  They're going to share a stadium?  They own half that stadium, Jimmy.  They own half that stadium.  It's shitty.  They do own half that stadium.  That's terrific.  It's shitty.  Half stadium.  Play a whole game.  A whole game and half stadium.  And when you're there,  it looks like it's the Jets' home field.  It really does to me. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  And then you go next week  and it looks like the Giants' home field.  It's just cheesy.  It's like give the guys  a home stadium.  This place is beautiful.  How about...  Fucking beautiful.  What if Brett Favre  is available next season  and the Jets could bring him back  and give him one more shot?  Can we take him  and put him in the middle  of the field  and execute him?  Yeah, Brett Favre...  Give it an Al-Qaeda soccer match.  I guess the paper said  that Brett Favre  finally ran out of bullets.  That's it.  Yeah, his streak is over  at two...  Do you understand 
[01:10:00]  how amazing that is?  He was inactive yesterday, officially.  He skinned his little dick helmet.  He was not active for the game.  So his streak ends  at 297 consecutive  fucking football games.  It's not the Jen Sturger thing,  you don't think?  No, he got fucked up by the Bills.  He really is.  They fucked him up.  He shouldn't have been playing  for a couple of weeks.  Yeah.  No, they fucked him up.  He's done, man.  And I guess his streak,  you gotta count the playoff games, too.  Supposedly it's 300  and anyone know?  320, I'm gonna guess, 
[01:10:30]  somewhere around there.  So who's next in line there?  No one worth talking about.  I think Jerry Birch.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  This is...  Manning.  Manning.  Which one?  Peyton Manning.  Peyton Manning.  Peyton Manning.  Peyton, how many  consecutive games he has?  Somewhere around...  I think it's somewhere  in the middle, too.  200?  He needs to play  the next six seasons,  basically,  without missing a game.  Yeah.  In football.  Wow.  That's crazy.  That is an amazing record,  as much as I'm not  a big Brett Favre fan,  you gotta... 
[01:11:00]  You gotta give it up  to him there, Mikey.  For a guy with a fucking  skinny little helmet,  I will never, ever  be able to look at him  and not think...  The same way?  ...of his little,  tiny,  doughboy,  World War I helmet helmet.  He looks like he's ready...  His dick looks like  it's ready to just  come out of a trench  with a gas mask on.  Poor Brett Favre.  Poor Brett Favre.  That's it, though. 
[01:11:30]  He'll probably sit  the rest of the season now.  Because there's no reason  to play.  The team sucks.  Nah.  He's pretty fucked up.  You know,  he's got his legacy  to worry about.  That is...  That is a sad fucking...  It's just his little helmet.  Hey, Rocky,  thank you, brother.  We're hanging in there.  We really are.  We're trying.  What's he doing?  Yep, yep.  Three games.  Three games  for the season.  All right, brother.  Peace.  Bye.  Danny just pops the picture  and we just start cracking up. 
[01:12:00]  What is he thinking?  He's silly.  Just stop it.  It's not even hard.  He's got to have...  It's bent off to the right.  It's pulling one of those  fucking fish hook plays.  It's like he's offering  an hors d'oeuvre to somebody.  Yeah, here you go.  Why wouldn't you make sure  it's ready to go  before you send the picture?  I know.  Come on.  You're in total control  of sending the picture.  You want...  What? 
[01:12:30]  What is this guy saying?  Scott in Virginia.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, both?  Hey, buddy.  I was watching the game  and they said that  this week in practice  Brady took all the footballs,  put them in the freezer  for the game at Chicago  and told during the week  when he practiced,  told his teammates  to fucking deal  with the cold ball.  Wow.  Deal with cold balls.  Brady's having a fucking year, man.  How long are they actually  cold for, though?  Yeah, come on.  Fucking two plays?  I don't know, 
[01:13:00]  but if they were put  in the freezer,  who knows how long  they were in the freezer?  An hour or two, you know?  So it's not a bad idea  if that's what they did.  Football gives a hell  to win.  They hurt and fucking  they hurt when they  hit your hand.  Yeah, because Brady  wasn't affected by that  wind in Chicago.  He had a great game.  How about they put  their fucking hands  in the freezer, though?  That's the part that sucks.  Right.  When your hands are cold.  Yeah, make them put  him in ice water  or something  before they practice.  How about they sit  in the freezer  and have like ice cream  or something?  They could do that, Chip.  Yeah.  And one more. 
[01:13:30]  Brett in Virginia.  Brett.  Hey, I was talking  about your theory  on Tom Brady.  He went to college  four years in Michigan.  I believe he could  be right on that.  Yeah, so he played  in some cold weather  climates there  before he hit the NFL.  That's right.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Of course you do.  All right.  Anyone watch the games  last night?  Obviously, we were  at the Paul McCartney show,  but I didn't know  they were playing football.  Not I.  No.  Giants beat the Vikings  21-3.  Oh, I did see  the clip of that.  Yeah.  I watched it.  No incidents? 
[01:14:00]  I said there had to be  some kind of problem  yesterday with the free tickets.  They said it was  an unusual vibe  in Detroit  because they were  doing a lot of  Lions chants.  They were chanting  a lot of Lions stuff  and people were just  kind of...  It was like a little  commercial for the Lions.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it  and they watched the game  that they really  didn't give a shit about.  Right.  That was it.  Giants won.  Giants won 21-3  and then the Ravens  beat the Texans  28-20. 
[01:14:30]  Texans.  I was playing a game.  I was watching a game  Jim Norton  versus his dignity  and Jim lost again.  One, one.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Is this the  Kevin in Connecticut?  Kev?  Good morning, guys.  Yeah, that's you.  What's up, brother?  That Russian bungee video  reminded me of a video  that I saw  and I sent you a link.  It's the sickest,  creepiest video  I've ever seen.  Okay.  It's a guy jumping off  like a seven-story building  and walking away.  Why did he jump off  the building?  Was he trying to kill himself 
[01:15:00]  or he knew he could do this?  I don't know  but it just reminded me  and I found it  and I sent you a link.  I don't know  if I could get to the link  right now.  How do we find it  real fast with Danny?  Man jumps off  building and lives.  Okay.  Man jumps off  and lives.  Do you know the details  like why he did this?  No, I think  it might even mean  it's like trick photography  but the guy jumps off  the building.  Oh, I bet it's fake.  We're good at trick photography.  Let's look at the movie  special effects thing.  Yeah.  We're good at this shit.  Looks pretty good, though. 
[01:15:30]  Did you guys see  speaking of videos?  Will Ferrell  and John C. Reilly  redoing the Bing Crosby  David Bowie thing?  No fucking way.  They did.  We were just talking  about that, too.  Oh, man.  It's on Funny or Die.  It's worth  taking a look at.  John C. Reilly  funniest motherfucker  in life.  John C. Reilly  is hysterical.  You're probably right.  It's fucking hysterically funny.  I didn't see that one.  Yeah, that's making the rounds.  Kevin, we're having  a tough time.  What?  Oh, wait.  We're now at the... 
[01:16:00]  Fucking Will Ferrell  as David Bowie.  Will Ferrell.  You want to hear a little of this?  Yeah, please.  Kevin, will...  I'll...  Give me a direct...  Give me a direct message there.  I already did.  Okay.  We'll find it for later.  Thanks, brother.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I mean, it's frame by frame exact.  Is it exactly the same?  Yeah.

Oh, I'm David Bowie.  I live down the road.  Oh.  So, first of all,  he's not around.  He's not around, is he?  I can honestly say  I haven't seen him,  but come on in.  Go ahead.  No, I'm serious.  He's fucking great.  He looks great.  It's exactly the same.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  You're not the poor relation  from America, right?  Ha ha.  Gee, new shirt travels fast.  I'm big.  Nice to meet you.  You're the one that sings, right?  Well, right or wrong,  I sing either way.  Well, I sing too.  Oh, good.  I sing.  Most of the contemporary stuff.  Do you like modern music?  Oh, I think it's marvelous.  Some of it really fine. 
[01:17:30]  But tell me,  do you ever listen  to any of the older fellas?  Oh, yeah, sure.  I like John Lennon  and the other one  with the Harry Nielsen.  Oh, you go back that far, huh?  Yeah.  I'm not as young as I look.  None of us is these days.  In fact, I've got a six-year-old son  and he really gets excited  around the Christmas holiday thing.  Do you go in for any  of the traditional things  in the Bowie household  Christmas time?  Bowie household?  Oh, yeah, most of them, really.  Presents, 
[01:18:00]  treat,  decorations,  agents sliding down the chimney.  What?  I was just seeing  if you were paying attention.  Ha ha.  Actually, our family  do most of the things  that other families do.  Sing the same songs.  Yeah.  I even have a go  at White Christmas.  You do, huh?  And this one  is my son's favorite.  Do you know this one?  Oh, I do indeed.  I love it.  I do indeed.  Rightly.  That's killing it.  Just Steve Kroll.  Yeah.  Did they actually sing? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Brother.  Then you've got to stay for the end.  Yeah.  We're committed.  Come,  They told me  Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum  I really don't have to do this.

[01:19:30]  Live in peace  Again  So  Peace on earth  What made them do this?  I don't know  Like why did they do this?  Because they can  They're probably just bored  Every child  Must be made aware  Every child  Must be made to care  I'm sure for the video they are  I'm sure they think they sang it though  Sounds like their voices right? 
[01:20:00]  It sounds like Riley  I would have thought no  To give all the love  That he can  It does sound like John Riley  Yeah  I pray my wish  His hair is hilarious  Will Ferrell  It really is  The David Bowie  What an ass he looks like  John C. Rye is making  The bean faces  At the camera  His hair is all slicked back 
[01:20:30]  Does John C. Rye make movies anymore?  Or is he just  An internet fucking sensation?  This character  Nothing better than Steve Rool  His gut is great  His fucking sweater is all open and shitty  I think it's the exact sweater  Crosby is wearing  Hey  Oh you go back that far  I love the fact that he's 
[01:21:00]  Oh that's a pretty little thing isn't it?  Very nice  Alright Bobby  You have a Merry Christmas  It's Bowie  It's David fucking Bowie  And it's Bing fucking Crosby  There you go

I don't know  Maybe they  Maybe they were trying to go for the bigger audience  Who knows  God damn fucking  Pretty good right?  John C. Rye is great  By the way  I apologize to all the football fans  I got the Ravens score wrong  I was at the Paul McCartney show  So I didn't even know  But it says 28-20 here 
[01:22:00]  But I guess  The game went into overtime  At 28-28  So who won?  Who did the sports sheet?  Don't win  They did win  They did win  It was just a different  They were down  They came back and won  It was just a different score  So I apologize  Sorry about that  Want to do a little break?  Yeah we could do that  Hey we got Kevin Hart coming in today  I haven't seen Kevin in a while  But he's been a friend of mine for a long long time  And he's massively huge  He might be  He's one of the  I'd say one of the top five drawing comics in the country right now 
[01:22:30]  It's just him, Chelsea  Really?  He fucking sells everything out  Yeah  Everything  It's him, Chelsea, Aziz  Maybe Daniel Tosh  There's a few guys that are selling tickets like that  And he's a fucking hilarious dude  Hilarious  Yeah yeah  Kevin's a really funny guy  We'll have him in about a half hour  A little more Paul McCartney today  Why not?  Dude, you know what song I forgot?  We don't have to play it  But I forgot how good it was  I'd never heard it before  It was a Wings tune in 1985  Oh yeah  Dude, what a great tune that was  I'd never heard that before  Get Wings Greatest Hits  Yeah, maybe I will 
[01:23:00]  Although it's not on there  That song's not in there  Oh really?  Yeah  I didn't know that  Well  I wore out my Wings Greatest Hits  Is Band on the Run good  Or is there other albums that have better songs on it?  Band on the Run is good  I know the Greatest Hits  So I don't even know what's on Band on the Run anymore  Oh, Blue Bird is a Wings song?  What?  Oh, it's Black Bird is a Beatles song  Okay  Yeah  He sings about birds with colors a lot  He likes birds  He likes the birds  Who is this bitch?  We got this

She's 18 now  And she was like having a party  Five days after her  Her 18th birthday  And she's smoking out of a bong  There's a video of this  Oh yeah  It's everywhere  And she's acting like a lunatic 
[01:27:30]  And she gets salvia  Now salvia is the shit that guy was taking  That they're drinking out of cups  Right?  He was smoking that  I'm not really sure  I don't know  I think that might have been  Something a little harder than salvia  Yeah we know salvia  Maybe you  We know salvia from Joe Rogan  Yeah yeah  Joey talks about it  And it's legal  You can get it at head shops  Now how is this legal  We can go right now and get it  And how long is it going to be legal?  To be honest with you  They're starting to get rid of the herbal  Substances that are out there  There's some stuff called  Like you'll hear 
[01:28:00]  Sometimes on the news  Like K2 and Spice  And things like that  And it's basically just this  Engineered high  That you could  It's you know  It's packaged  To look like oregano  But you do smoke it  And get some kind of high off it  I don't know  I've never tried it  But that stuff is going  State by state  And being illegalized  Yeah that's what they do  State by state  But I don't know  What the laws are  Regarding salvia  I don't think it's  I don't know if it's banned yet  We haven't played the audio  On our show yet  We should I guess  No I'd love to  I haven't heard it  So it's new to me  The family's very worried  Are they very worried 
[01:28:30]  Is she like  Going in Lindsay Lohan direction  She probably has to I guess  You think she's going  In that hole  Yeah she'll probably do that  She's going to be drinking  And showing her snatch  Getting out of cars  I would think so  Titty shots and stuff  She's got a tat  On the side of her tit  Doesn't she  Yeah  It's kind of like under  And to the side  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah  I mean yeah  And she's 18 now  How fast did that happen  She is  18 years it seems like  Jimmy  Wait Ozzy was in an accident

[01:29:30]  And trade information  Departing without incident  There was no injuries  Okay  You think Ozzy  He held up everybody  Because he feels like  He can't move his car  Yeah yeah  Like you're talking about  Those guys that get in  Fender benders  And feel they have to  Leave the car  Exactly where it is  In the middle of the fucking road  Move your car  I would have comforted him  You would have comforted him  It's okay man  It happens buddy  Don't worry about it  I think I was going too slow  It would have been great  If he got tapped  And 18 pounds of books  Smashed him in the back  Of the head  Why  Because  It would have hurt my feelings  I can't 
[01:30:00]  I can't let it go  Where are the  You shouldn't  Where are the books  At this point  Where are they now  Did you take them back  I haven't touched them  They're probably in the office  They're probably in the office  The guys are working out with him  He's now back in Beverly Hills  I guess  I guess you're not going to be  Giving him his books  What do you mean  I want to  There was a little hope  That he was coming back  For the books  Yeah there was  Or at least one of his people  Yeah  This is the  Miley Cyrus  She is smoking something 
[01:30:30]  Out of a bong  It could be pot  I mean what else would it be  The salvia could be a cover up  To just  Because that could have  Just been pot now  Playing a little bush  In the background  Whose scumbag  Is fucking filming her  Hold on pause that  No I got a whole theory  On that  Fuck that  I was just going to say  She's not stupid  I have a feeling  She wanted this out there  Knowing that it's  A legal substance  Dude  But  Come on  This is way too obvious  That her friend's  Going to fucking  Get that shit out there  Why would she want to do that  She's huge  She's a Disney star  Because maybe she's

[01:33:00]  With Miley Cyrus  I still want to hang out with her  Get it  More of that  Yeah you need to do more 
[01:33:30]  You're not like  As dumb as you should  You're going to see me  Leave me to the home  You know what Liam looks like  Wow  I saw Jimmy making some  Some faces over there  I made a face of myself  Cause I said like  Father like daughter  But then I was embarrassed  Cause I was thinking of  Hasselhoff  Yeah  And I just realized  I was a man of myself  The father was achy breaky  Heart guy  So  So it still kind of worked  Yeah exactly  I think she let them film  Cause she was so fucked up  She had bad judgment  Maybe you're right though  Maybe she did  But if you want something  On TV  I think she's savvy 
[01:34:00]  To all that shit  And knows what could get out there  So come on  Maybe she wants  To change her image  And it seems like  It's a really good friend of hers  So why would her friend  Fuck her over that way  There's some suspicion there  Maybe you're right  That's all I'm saying  I don't know shit  You might be right  Half my stuff isn't true  I just fucking throw things out there  She's so huge  Like she doesn't need  Like you know how people  Start to go over a little bit  They're done  And they do like  A little image boost  She doesn't need that dude  She's fucking massive  And her image isn't  That goody two shoes  Disney girl anymore 
[01:34:30]  She's kind of  You know  Gotten over that  With the way she dresses  And shit  Like a bit of a wild gal  What's the back story  On that video  Anyone know  What are they sort of saying  Yeah any comments on it  Like hey  What the fuck  Sources have told TMZ  That a college student  Who came into possession  Of the video  Contacted one of Miley's reps  Shortly after Thanksgiving  Asking if the rep  Wanted his coffee  We're told money was discussed  In exchange for turning over  The video  So I guess apparently  They tried to scoop up  All the copies 
[01:35:00]  Before it got huge  But it just didn't work  Oh fuck  You know what  But it starts out  As one copy  And it seems like  It's someone very close  To Miley Cyrus  Same thing that happened  With De La Hoya  Maybe  Could be  It seems to me  That De La Hoya's computer  Went on when he wasn't  Ready for it  And this might have been  Someone who knew this girl  Or had the video  And then just copied the video  It could have been  Somebody who did that too  It could have just been  A personal video  That her trusted friend  Would never have turned over  That somebody else  Turned over  Brett Favre's cock  Exactly  It's all over the place 
[01:35:30]  Brett Favre's cock  A small shroom  Brett Favre's cock  Let me say hi  To Sean in Pittsburgh  Sean  Hey love you guys  Love the show  Of course you should  That's how they went  From listening to Bush  To the very next song  Would be Eagles  And that's why  Radio fucked themselves  I've said it for years  You don't need to keep  In one stupid genre  Because that's not  How people listen to music  They could listen to Bush  And go into an Eagles song  Yeah  It doesn't have to be Bush  And then another  You know  Alt rock song 
[01:36:00]  That's how these  Dumb programmers think  Still  Until satellite  And then you got  So much room  You could do this  Yeah  You know  A channel for everything  But you could also  Make your own shit  In the genre  You could have a lot  More freedom here anyway  Which is nice  But go from Bush  To Eagles  That's completely normal  But if  If you told a  Radio programmer  To do that  They would lose  Their minds  They would say  What's wrong with you  You think I can make  A mixtape  And get it to Miley Cyrus  Yeah I think you  Mixtape  She's perfect for you  I want to get  A mixtape together  Perfect for you right 
[01:36:30]  See if like  She'll hang out  Smoke some salvia  Thank you Sean  Salvia fuck Vicky  By the way  I guess  Salvia  Salvia is now  Illegal across the country  That happened two weeks ago  According to Jason  What  And Danny's saying no  Jason's an idiot  I love this  Then we have to go to Jason  Jason Danny's saying no  Hi what's up boys  Yeah we just got  I worked for a pharmacy  We got a release  From the FDA  That they thought  It was such a big problem 
[01:37:00]  That the attorney general  Stepped in  And they scheduled  Salvia and all the other  THC precursors  As controlled substances  Is it legal officially  Or are they trying  Illegal  I mean illegal  Yeah they're supposed  To be pulling it  From all the  Head shops  Places  All that stuff right now  Really Danny  I think you might be  Talking about K2  And spice  And those herbal remedies  I don't think you're  Thinking of salvia  Salvia is legal  And I think  I think all 50 states  I don't know a lot  About all the different  Products  Right so then you don't  Know if it's salvia  Or if it's  Or if it's some  Other substance 
[01:37:30]  In other words  You could have  Stopped at  I don't know  Yeah  That's basically  I don't know  Yes sir  You really made an ass  In all this  Well  Why don't we put  Your words up there  For everyone to see  I don't know  What's that  Fast time  Go to the  Attorney General's website  You guys can read about it  I'm too busy right now  I won't see anything  About salvia  I'm sure  We're very busy right now  Being entertaining  On the radio  Alright boys  Punch it out  No way  No way  This is garbage  Not me 
[01:38:00]  No way  Not once  Not never  Not never  Alright let's go to  Seth on Long Island  Seth  What's up guys  Sitting in traffic  On the LAE  What happened  Sitting in traffic  On the LAE  Listen I don't think  Any of you guys  Have smoked salvia  That shit just makes you  Blank out  Go dark  For like two seconds  Not act anywhere near  How stoned  Miley Cyrus appears  So maybe she was  Just  Maybe she was  Fucking smoking pot  But  That would be really bad  Because that's 
[01:38:30]  Obviously  Illegal substance  I mean hey look  Anything could have  Been in that  In that bong  You know  But I know  There are different  Levels of salvia  Like I know  Like the dosage  Ranges from like  A little bit  To a lot of bit  This makes you  Black out even more  All it does  Is just like  A really intense thing  Nothing  Nothing like  Like a high  Seth you've done it  Oh yeah  Yeah  Can I just say  To that last caller  I went to the  Attorney General's  Website  And it says here  That salvia divinorum  And salvanorin 
[01:39:00]  Are not currently  Controlled  Under the CSA  Ah  Thank you very much  That was just  Recently taken off  The shelf  What's that  It's the K2 stuff  Yeah I know  That's what I had said  But the caller  Had insisted  It was  It had some weird  Stuff like lion's  Tail in it  Check out the ingredients  Yeah I know  But you know  Those things  I was just talking  About this before  When those things  Come around  Those herbal  You know  Weed things  They get around  Until it gets  The attention  Of local lawmakers 
[01:39:30]  And then you know  They ban it locally  But then you know  Two weeks later  Some new stuff  Comes around  It's the same stuff  As the old stuff  So  Now we got a pharmacist  Saying it's illegal  In 30 states  It's legal in 30 states  Because the pharmacist  Is where you were  Picking it up anyway  Right  What's that  You don't go to  A pharmacist for sale  We didn't say that  No  A pharmacist  That knows a little bit  About this stuff  Saying that  That's all  Alright man  Thank you  Let me go to  Anthony on Long Island  Oh that's me  That's right  I'm home already  Good morning boys 
[01:40:00]  I really think  That Hope and  Jimmy have it  A little bit wrong here  I can see Miley  Sitting on her bed  With her friends  Just before she was  Smoking the bong  I can trust you guys  Right  I can trust you  Right  And now she's on her bed  Clutching a pillow  Just like Britney Spears was  I can't trust anybody  Brian and all that good stuff  I'm not saying you're wrong  At the beginning of the end  She's going to turn out  Just like Britney  Dude I always  I said Opie might have a point  I don't know  I'm not convinced either way 
[01:40:30]  But watching that  It's like it could be  That she was aware of it  Or it could just be  That the video was taken  From her friend  They do a lot of  This horse shit in Hollywood  To get attention  So it's not crazy  To think that she might have said  Yeah what the fuck  Let's get this out there  Or someone fucked her  Sure  Absolutely  I agree with you guys  But what I'm saying  Is you can absolutely see  That she  You know  She's starting that demise  Right now  That you know  All of her friends  That are 18 years old  That aren't famous  Eventually will want to be famous 
[01:41:00]  And the only way  They can get famous  Is to fuck her in the ass  So  Alright  I don't know  If we need language like that  Great commentary  That's exactly how  They discussed this on CNN  Beautiful  Thank you  That doesn't help  The radio show sir  Just to be sullied  With that type of talk  Fuck her in the ass  I mean I think  I'm sorry I had to potty mouth  It up a little bit  But I  Certainly did  I know sir  But we don't need to talk about it  You're not the serial killer  Are you  No  Hell no  Jimmy by the way 
[01:41:30]  Are there any tickets left  For Saturday Late Show  Yes  The other two are completely sold out  Oh man  I'll be your best friend  If you leave one in my name  What's that sir  I'll be your best friend  If you leave actually two in my name  Well if you were a true friend  You wouldn't need to put stipulation  On our friendship  You would just say  I'm going to come regardless  Yes  If you were a good friend  You'd buy one  And then ask me to sign it  Like a friend  One more thing  From Captain Jack  As far as the Miley Cyrus thing goes  As Kevin Hart walks down the  Is he coming  Hallway  Hey Captain Jack 
[01:42:00]  How's it going guys  Yeah if you go back  And listen to that video  Miley Cyrus is trying to rap  Nicki Minaj's verse  From the song Monster  She's got sort of  She's making all those weird  Like voices  Speaking in tongues  Or some shit  Oh really  Yeah  If you go back  Or you pull up the track  And put them next to each other  You'll be able to tell  Oh that's cool  Alright now we know  Everything there is to know  About the Miley Cyrus video  Thank you sir  Yeah I didn't think  She was just making that shit up 
[01:42:30]  Coming out of her fucking  Drugged down mind  No  Kevin Hart in studio  What's up brother  What's going on guys  How's it going  First time on the show  First time on the show  We gotta make it a good time  And I guess  I guess Jimmy does know you  Cause I saw the big hug  That was going on  Good friend of mine  Good friend of mine  I don't like to admit it  But I love Jimmy  Jimmy's the shit  And the first thing  Kevin said  Cause he's a shit talker  Is your face is getting fat  And I knew  I actually wore a big sweatshirt  Cause I'm like  The first thing he's gonna do  Is tell me I'm getting fat  And he's right  I really hate the direction  His body's going  I really do 
[01:43:00]  Poor Jimmy  But he's aware of it  No  As long as you know  What's going on  It's fine  I just  I hate it  Cause I know where he used to be  And the fact that  He doesn't care anymore  He's letting himself go  I was looking at photos of us  From probably  Me, you, Patrice  Probably from  I want to say  The seller from 2000  And it's just like  I'm dressed very poorly  What pounds  And I look very  I look much thinner  And it's really fucking  It's really humiliating  You fatter older gentleman  And I'm happy for you  That you're selling out the beacon

[01:45:00]  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Go to KHART online  K-H-A-R-T online  One word dot com  It makes me so happy  To fucking see  Keith Robinson  Is trying to be happy for Kevin  But he just wants to hang himself  No man  Keith is happy man  That's my old head man  You know  Keith comes to shows and stuff  I told him  I had a spot for him  You know  Because the host needed somebody  To open up for him  And I told Keith  It would be great for him  To warm up the crowd  But I was still  Yeah he didn't want to do it  I told him I would pay him  I would pay him good  But you know  Sometimes pride gets in the way 
[01:45:30]  Of these type of things man  But no man  I'm happy  My whole New York family  As far as comedians  I wouldn't be in the position  That I am in  If it wasn't for these guys  If it wasn't for the  Patrice Gems  Those assholes  Hey you know  None of them are good people  None of them are good people  Yeah we know that  You know  They gave me constant shit man  And helped me build character  And really  That's amazing  That's amazing  This fucking shot of me  Patrice and Kevin  Holy shit  How long ago is that  That's gotta be 2000  That's 2000-2001 right there 
[01:46:00]  Yeah  That's 2000-2001  My shirt is really bad  I'm willing to bet  Jim still has that shirt  It's still a rotation  It's probably still  An heavy dress rotation right now  My girlfriend goes to  My old fucking pictures  Of my clothes  And she's just like  What the fuck is wrong with you  Really  How did anybody ever  Fuck you in his clothes  It really is fucking  Here's another horrible one  Ah that's  Look at that  I remember that sweater  I remember that sweater  Me, Keith, and Kevin  Oh man  What do you have 
[01:46:30]  A Calvin Klein  Jeans  Sweatshirt  Whenever Jim wore  Name brand clothes  You would know  Cause it was plastered  On his chest  There was no discreet  There was no discreet level  About it  He wants everyone to know  That's what he's wearing  No but it was  D-K-N-Y  Right on his ass  It really was humiliating  I just wanted the guys  To like me  Aw Jimmy  Nah I love him though man  That's  Who else Jim  Colin  Voss  Colin's doing great  His show's on  I heard he had 
[01:47:00]  A play that was up  Yeah it's good  That's doing really well  I gotta see it  He just got extended to  February  February 5th  And it's good  To get great reviews  Time Magazine  Everyone's interviewing him  All over TV  Yes  Oh get out of here  Yeah  Good for Colin man  Colin deserves it  Cause he's on his way  That's one thing  No matter what the  Follow up to that is  People always say  You know Colin deserves it  There's always some  Shitty remark afterwards  But everyone says  Colin deserves that  And he absolutely does  He does  He does  A funny motherfucker 
[01:47:30]  And just a  Really genuine guy  Colin's been around  But that's why  I say he deserves it  He's a good dude  Cause he really is  One step from finish  And he knows it  It's so close  He's so close  To being on the couch  For the rest of his life  He's been there  A few times already too  Like where it's like  Uh oh  He's like a cat  He won't die  We wanted him to die  Several times  I would love for Colin  Just to be like  I got nothing  They keep giving him  One more chance  One more fucking chance  Colin looks over the  Bannister for a second  Too long  Every time now  Like when he's 
[01:48:00]  Standing at the edge  He just like  You know you just  Take a look  Colin just looks  And goes  It would feel good  On the way down  No I gotta catch one  I'm probably gonna  Go there and ruin it  I think I'm gonna go there  And call myself  I want to heckle him  So fucking bad  I want to  Like you know  You want to  But you can't  Like I wanna be  The guy to do something  Yeah yeah  Something that's just  Uncalled for  Right in the middle  Of his play line  That you can't say cut to  But you gotta keep going  That's good  I wanna see him  No  I wanna see him  In the theater  You can have  Dramatic pauses  Without some drunk  Yelling some shit out 
[01:48:30]  And that would be  Horrible in a  Fucking Broadway theater  Colin just stops  And you're like  Yeah remote control  Like what the fuck  Are you doing  In my show  Yeah Colin quit  Yeah  Just yell it out  In the middle of his  Fucking A  You just gave us  A good idea though  We should all go there  And just heckle him  All pick one show  One fucking show  He would die  He would love it  Who you can't  Knuckles  What the fuck  Are you doing  In the front way  That's it  That's what we do 
[01:49:00]  He doesn't run  Conkala  By the stupid  Nothing  Governors  What are you doing  Yeah well  Everybody's kinda happy  For Colin  None of us are happy  For Tom Papa  Though in the marriage ref  Even though I love Tom  But that's a friend  I don't need to see  You don't want to see Tom  No I don't  Want to see Tom  No  I don't  Because Colin  Was always ahead of me  Tom's a peer  Another one with Jerry  Under Jerry's wing  Jerry is just a star maker  Just a star maker  Star maker  But a nerd  He is a nerd  We saw him last night  At the Paul McCartney show  Jerry Seinfeld is a nerd 
[01:49:30]  To watch Jerry  Bopping his head  And tapping his toe  To Paul McCartney's song  There's no more movement  You're not gonna get any more movement  No you're not  He like  He'll bob his head  He's got his big glasses  And his hair is shorter now  And he just looks  Really goofy  Chris Rock is the black version  Of Seinfeld for us  Really  Is he like nerdy  Seinfeld is your nerd  That puts a lot of people  On Chris Rock  That's our version  Chris is  Oh yeah  He's really nerdy  Like just  You don't get it  Like  It's like  What the fuck is wrong  Chris  When you socialize  Chris doesn't talk 
[01:50:00]  He's very  I saw him last night  He walks over  And he's like  They're letting the whole neighborhood in  And he just walks by  You're right  He's fucking awkward  Chris is very awkward man  It's the most difficult  I'm gonna tell you  Chris Rock story  I'm in the mall right  I'm in Phoenix  This is doing Super Bowl weekend  So everybody  People keep getting trumped  By trumped  I mean like  Every time you see somebody in the mall  You go wow  There's such and such  But then you see somebody else  Right  So Biz Markie's there 
[01:50:30]  So I'm like  Oh man look  There's Biz Markie  So you see some people  Like Biz  It's crazy  Terrell Owens comes in  And they're like  Oh  Terrell Owens is in the mall  Now Biz kind of gets put off  To the side  All the people in the biz  Run over to Terrell Owens  Half of them gets Patrice  So like  And I know Jim's gonna give me shit  So then like  I go downstairs  I see Terrell  I'm like  Oh I didn't even know Terrell  There's some people like  Yo Kevin Hart the comedian  Nobody moved  It wasn't like a shift 
[01:51:00]  In the gears  But somebody did point  Right  So Chris comes out  And everybody's like  Chris Rock  Right  Lied to you not  A bunch of people swarming  Chris just put his hands in the air  He's like  Ha ha  He just went back  In the store  He just walked  At the store  But he didn't know  How to talk to the people  Ha ha ha  He had nobody with him  It's just a little  Dirty hat on  He didn't know  How to deal  What are you doing 
[01:51:30]  You're gonna get raped  Chris  What are you doing  By yourself  Oh that is the fucking truth  Literally just in the mall  By himself  Coming out of like  A Barnes and Nobles  Like just by himself  Nobody with him  That's fucking great  He kind of looks past you  When he talks to  And he's not being a dick  He's just  He's an awkward guy  Really  Yeah  They're telling the whole name of it  And he's walking  You don't know  What he's talking about  Good joy  It was a very odd  Always an odd encounter  It's always awkward  Like you don't know  If you should walk away  If it's over  One of the very awkward things 
[01:52:00]  Was when he was talking  To Patrice about  Oh  Being a bridge burner  Yeah yeah  Like Patrice I guess  Was up for the role  Of the father  In Everybody Hates Chris  Was it Terry Crews  Yeah  Got that part  Yeah  He got the gig  Got the gig  And well we had Chris  And Patrice  And Chris is telling Patrice  Why he didn't get the gig  And it's because  And he pretty much  Just lambasted Patrice  About how he burns bridges  He doesn't know how to  Be like  A Hollywood guy  To play the game  To just play the game  And know how 
[01:52:30]  That's the last conversation  I had with Patrice  The last conversation  I had with Patrice  Is it really  Take the Hollywood gig  Go fuck yourselves  You tell them to kiss my ass  Except face  You go  That's the last conversation  I don't know how to do that  He just gets pissed  But then Patrice will have  An epiphany  No  He has like a thought  He is a fucking piss  But he was funny  Because he did a pilot  Or something  And he said  He came in  And he's like 
[01:53:00]  I've been a dick  Because he ran the project  And he goes  Whenever you're doing something  You're a dick  He goes  I've been a dick  On a lot of projects  And I'm sorry I was a dick  Like once he ran it  Remember he came in  He said once he ran it  It's different from that side  From that side  You don't want anybody  Asking questions  Do what you're fucking told  Do your gig  And that's it  You get the completely  Different perspective  Only other time  I've seen Chris  In a weird situation  Is with Tracy Morgan  Tracy  This is probably  The funniest one  Tracy  Dean Edwards  Just got Saturday Live  So Dean Edwards 
[01:53:30]  Is in  We all in the cellar  Tracy Morgan  Sitting down  Chris Rock comes in  He's like  Congratulations Dean  He said  You know  It's going to be  A lot of work man  Just stay focused  Make sure you do  What you're told  So Tracy's eating  Like a plate of rice  He's got like  Some chicken  Like you can hear  The fork drop  On the plate  And he says  Yeah  He looks at Chris  I wish you had  Told me that Chris  You know  You never told me that  You know  I had blood on my knife  Shit on my wall  I just got quiet  Everybody was just  Looking around 
[01:54:00]  Like nobody knew  So Chris said  Stay away from Tracy  If you want to do  Anything right  More good advice  He said  I don't know  What to tell you  About that guy  He just snapped on Chris  All I know  Is I got shit  On my walls  Now Chris  That's another  Always  Awkward interaction  Is with Tracy  You never know  Where it starts  And ends  Tracy told me  He knew me  For nine years  I had just met him  Really  I remember  When you first started  We was over  My mother's house  On the stoop  Remember  Yeah  Yeah  He scared me 
[01:54:30]  Into making him  I was so afraid  To say no  I didn't remember  Yeah  No I remember  The first time  He met a girlfriend  Of my ex  He was at one  Of the softball games  We were doing  And it was back  In the locker room  And he just looks  And he goes  You got childbearing hips  I want you to have  My daughter  I'll get you pregnant  I'll get you pregnant  You have my daughter  And then he's got  On the floor  And started doing  The humping moves  He would do to her  Yeah I'll be doing this  And he's just 
[01:55:00]  Fucking the floor  And you're like  What the  There is no one  Like that motherfucker  He is crazy  Tracy's in his own lane  He's in his own lane  Yep  He's in his own lane  He has different levels  I saw him at the cellar  Recently  Like probably maybe  Maybe a month ago  I walked in  And we said hello outside  And he goes  You know  Gotta get that lunchbox  Go to work  Alright  Alright Tracy  I guess that's  Kind of a euphemism  For what we're doing here  Fair point  Yeah get that lunchbox  Hey  There's nothing  That you can say  No 
[01:55:30]  No  Sure do  Tracy  It's so hard  To have a conversation  With the guy  Because he just  Comes out with that shit  Tracy is like  Watching a video  It's like you're not  Going to get anything  Back from it  You can just enjoy it  And then walk away  I don't even know  He remembers my name  Gotta get that lunchbox  Go to work  Gotta go to work  Makes no sense at all  Yeah make sure  Your thermos is full  Yeah  What the fuck  Do you say to that  That's what I'm doing  Going to work  Good one  Yeah  Gonna be on time  Thank you man 
[01:56:00]  Fucking great  Going to be on time  You never know exactly  What he's  Holy fuck  I can picture your face  Jim  I can picture your stupid chin  I'll tell you the funniest  Jim  Remember when I  Jim one day  Right he's walking to the cellar  I get off  I get out of cab early  But I see Jim walking  He's carrying like these  Plastic bags  Which nobody really does  It's like some  CVS plastic bags  Like it's just  It's probably some  Ointment in them 
[01:56:30]  There's no reason  No reason for Jim  To have these plastic bags  Right  I say you know  I'm gonna scare Jim  I'm by myself  Just Jim walking by  I say I'm gonna run up  I'm gonna snatch Jim's bag  Come to see what he does  Right  I go  I run as fast as I can  I go to grab  I go to grab Jim's bags  He doesn't let go of the bag  I like got my hood  Over my face  He starts growling at me  What the fuck did you  I didn't plan it 
[01:57:00]  He turned into a  Full-fledged pit bull  I've never seen  Hey  I've never seen him  I said he didn't  Try to fight  He didn't say any words  He was like  I said Jim  What the fuck  Are you growling for  He's like  The level of panic  I was a little panicked  There must have been  Some good shit  In those bags  I'm like  Oh that's funny man  What was in the bags  I don't remember  I don't remember  But you're probably right  Some kind of ointment 
[01:57:30]  Just growl at the gentleman  I didn't know what to do  What would you do  If Willie Tyler's puppet  Ran up on you  Oh shit  That was fucking horrifying  That's pretty funny  He was so fucking scared  I was  And you didn't know  You didn't know  No not for the first second  Of course not  No it did not register  So you're like  Instantly  Oh my god  There's a crime  Yeah  Victor  I'm a victim  I didn't probably 
[01:58:00]  I wasn't probably being tough  I probably just had  Wrapped the bags in my hand  Yeah  And was trying to  Unravel them to hand  Take it please  Yeah  Throw your wallet  Down the street at him  Yeah  It's nose spray  There was no  There was no like  There was no sign of a man  At all  No  He's after my  Breathe Right strips  And you know  It was nothing worth  Fighting over  There was probably like  Two packs of extra gum  Breathe Right strip  You know it wasn't condoms  No 
[01:58:30]  No  No  Oh that's hysterical  I can so picture that  That's the only image  I have of Jim in my face  Is just him growling at me  With a plastic bag  Oh my god  That's funny man  It is humiliating  We should take a break  Let Kevin  We got you for a while  Right Kevin  Yeah man  Let's talk  I'm here  So you got Kevin Hart  Tower Theater  Friday and Saturday night  Tickets still available  For the second and third shows  He had to add shows  All over the place  Yeah go to  K Hart online  It's K-H-A-R-T online  Dot com  And Kevin will not be

[02:01:30]  Thank you. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you. 
[02:02:30]  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  We got Kevin Hart in studio for the first time, and we couldn't be happier.  A lot of gigs happening this weekend.  The Tower Theater, Upper Darby, Philly, Friday and Saturday night, tickets still available 
[02:03:00]  for those shows that were added because, you know, the original show sold out.  I don't mean to add shows, guys.  Don't think that I'm doing it to be a dick.  I'm not.  Like, what happens is my shows sell out.  Of course.  There's still some people want to see.  So they're like, well, Kevin, what can we do?  And I'm like, I don't know.  And they're like, well, let's just add another one.  So I was like, fine.  And then that was sold out.  And I was like, well, I don't, guys, really, you know, people are just not going to be able  to see me.  They're like, no, let's just do it again.  So it's not something you want to do.  It's basically because the people are kind of demanding it.  You got to do it. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Like, it's not me.  I'm not like, yo, let's more, more, more.  I want more money because I'm not that guy.  You know, I'm totally not that guy.  How great would a gas leak be?  You're awful.  Oh, 2,500 people died.  Kevin sued by 2,500 families.  I liked listening in to that Gator Bowl story.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you.  Holy shit, because my nephew went down there, man.  There are animals down there.  Listen, the most craziest comedy experience.  What I'm doing, because I know Jim will never see some of the things that I'm talking about. 
[02:04:00]  I'm living through Kevin.  Yeah, I'm trying to talk to him about some of the cool things.  I'm like, what's it like to be in shape?  He just tells me.  It's like, it's fun.  You take your shirt off the beach.  It's hot.  I'm like, really?  You're not ashamed?  He's like, no.  Shamed.  Don't even think twice, right?  Yeah, dude.  I got abs.  People see them.  It's cool.  I just got a tattoo on my abs that says, these are abs.  I have the same thing, but then it says, allegedly.  Okay, so.  No, let's talk to him about Gator Growl. 
[02:04:30]  The show I did is like 50,000, 60,000 kids out there.  Which can be a horror.  I've heard of the gig.  It can be a horror show for comedians.  No, no.  They said, no.  They definitely said some people have tanked it.  I won't go to the names or whatever.  But right before I go up.  Hey, I didn't tell you this.  They told me you couldn't curse.  Like, literally.  Right before you go on stage, it's like, dude, hey, you know, we have alumni.  Also, some people got their kids.  Oh, yeah.  No, you can either choose to listen to it or you can take the role that I took, which is  ignore it.  Oh, good.  You guys are going to end my career up here.  Yeah, exactly.  I went up there.  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:05:00]  I got it off the bat.  You got to go seriously scream off the bat.  But probably one of the best comedy experiences that I've had in my life.  Wow.  Like, literally, like, as with a show, with production, like, even though it was that  many people, to hear that and feel that from a crowd was amazing.  I said, but then afterwards, you know, you see these little college girls and stuff around.  I had to get out of there.  I had to get off campus.  I've never seen, like, I didn't know that that world exists, man.  Like, that little, the little drunk, the drunk white girl world that actually looks 
[02:05:30]  good and her titty just keeps coming out, but it's on purpose, but it's not.  I just felt like it was, I just felt like it was a serious situation for a case.  I said, there's no way this ends up good for me.  No way.  No way this ends up good for me.  Is that the most people you perform for?  60,000 is the most.  Oh, that's a fucking number.  60,000.  I was amazed at the amount of time, because you did it with Aziz and another comedian,  but I figured you'd do 20 minutes, 15 minutes.  45.  45.  45 minutes.  Me and Aziz.  In front of 60,000 animals.  That is fucking amazing.  And I'm not going to lie. 
[02:06:00]  Only time I'm probably, I think I farted through my first five minutes of a stage.  Like, you know, when you got that nervous feeling in your stomach, but it's like, I  was so scared not to get the first laugh, because your first one don't hit us, right?  You know, you're going to bomb.  If that first couple don't go, you don't get their attention, they're college kids.  They'll start grumbling, and then they're going to start looking for titties.  You don't want that grout.  You don't want that grout.  You've got to push the fear out.  Jimmy taught us that.  Yeah.  There's nothing better.  I shit before every major gig.  Are you serious?  Oh, fucking stew.  I'm fucking on the ball with my leg sticking straight out. 
[02:06:30]  I do.  I completely, my body empties.  It's a panic thing.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I have to shit at every venue I'm at.  Every single one?  Every one.  Not the cellar, but I mean, you know, when I go out and do a real gig.  Like, mark your territory.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not a comedy club, but a theater or whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nah, I can't.  I don't do that.  That was the only one where I've been like, where I've been like shit.  Like, I was scared.  Yeah, that's a lot of people.  Were there people sitting on the field?  No, that's why I was scared, because dude, it was only on the, you got the left  side and you got the right side.  And it was all full, literally, and there's nothing but field in front of you, but they 
[02:07:00]  had two big ass monitors on each side.  So everybody can see, you know, you're on stage, but then they can see like your close  ups and your face, and it was high definition.  And they weren't playing football after you guys?  No.  So why wouldn't they let the people on the field?  That's weird.  Were you in the end zone?  Chew that shit up.  On the stage.  We were in the end zone.  They'll chew that shit up.  Maybe they had a game the next day or something.  Nah, you can't mess up that field.  That is like, almost like cement.  It's like green cement, pretty much.  Yeah, you ain't fucking that field up.  We, that, that, it was scary though. 
[02:07:30]  That's all I know.  It was goddamn scary.  Probably to keep everyone under control, they have seats instead of like running around  the field.  What's funny though, you could tell like one side was younger, one side was older.  Like this was the kids, and this is the adults.  The parents.  The parents would laugh at specific stuff, the kids would laugh at stuff.  But then once you realized all the big laughs came from the kids, you said, fuck this  side.  Yeah.  Fuck the parents.  Fuck the parents.  Because the parents aren't going to boo.  The fucking kids are going to boo.  The kids are going to boo.  Yeah.  Kevin's in Little Fockers starting to interrupt you because they told us to promote, I forgot  he's in Little Fockers. 
[02:08:00]  That's right.  Comes out the 22nd.  Listen, people, I'm very honest about these type of things.  Okay?  All right.  You know, when you get there, guys, am I in the movie?  Yes.  Is it for long?  No.  I suggest get there early.  My scenes are probably like the first 10 minutes.  You know, funny scenes.  Funny scenes.  Just, you know, I just don't, I don't like my people thinking that I'm, you know, going  to be throughout the thing.  And then I get the message.  It's like, what happened, man?  Right.  We went just to see you.  What the fuck, Kevin?  No, no.  Listen, you got about a good three scenes in there.  But they're funny.  The movie's funny as shit, too. 
[02:08:30]  You get killed off in a real morbid way.  Wouldn't that be hysterical in a comedy?  That was funny.  Yes.  He just killed off horrible in the franchise.  His love slowly did.  And it's funny, like, and this is not, I don't know how this happens.  It's not intentional.  But in movies like these, like, I'm always the only black guy.  Really?  I'm dead serious.  I'm the only black guy.  Why is that?  I have no idea at all.  Why do they do that?  Listen, I have no idea at all, but I'm him.  You're the guy.  They could easily put black guy number one by my name at the end of the movie.  And it would be fine. 
[02:09:00]  Or just black guy.  Or black guy.  You said you're the only one.  Just black guy.  Oh, yeah.  What happens is he gets on set, and they're like, do we really want a bunch of them acting  like this?  Just him alone.  He's good enough.  Probably don't want to answer this, but what do they have you doing in the movie?  Oh, man.  No, I'm funny.  I play, I'm like what Ben Stiller used to be.  Like, when he first was a nurse, you know, he kind of didn't get any respect.  You know, he was a guy who was kind of a misfit to some degree, but had a passion for  medicine.  So now, he's grown in the ranks.  He's higher in the hospital, and I work underneath him.  So all the things that he can't do, he passes to me. 
[02:09:30]  So I got like a good three or four scenes.  It's funny.  Do you have De Niro?  Any scenes with De Niro?  De Niro comes in one scene.  But I talk to him off set, maybe for a good 10, 15 minutes.  Nice guy.  And I didn't want to push my luck any.  So I just said, I left it as, yeah, we're friends.  He was probably asking if you had any sisters.  So do you bring him to set with you?  What do you talk to him about?  You know, you got to go with the first thing.  You know, hey, man, I'm a big fan, dude.  Love your work.  And after that, I break the ice.  He said that to you? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, why not?  He knows.  I was at the Gator Bowl.  No, man, he was a cool dude, though.  Just talking to him, man, about the movie, the franchise.  You know, he was talking to me about comedy.  You know, just telling me, like, he loves to do comedy.  He's happy that now he gets a chance to do comedy and not be so serious all the time.  Small talk.  It was very, very small talk.  Me and Ben, I've known Ben for a long time.  Talked to Ben for hours.  Jessica Alba was in it. 
[02:10:30]  Talked to her for a long time.  I'll tell you who's funny.  Owen.  Owen is funny.  Really?  Owen Wilson?  Owen is funny, man.  He is funny.  Owen is funny as hell.  Offset, like, that dry humor.  Just looking and talking about people.  Like, he's funny as shit.  Owen had you laughing for days.  That's really it.  Those are the only people I was around on set.  I didn't get to see Barbra Streisand.  I didn't get to see Dustin when I was there.  They filmed different scenes, different days.  But, you know, Ben, I'm a fan of him, man.  He works hard.  His franchise. 
[02:11:00]  To see him behind the camera and in front of the camera is crazy.  Oh, he directed it?  He might as well have.  He knows the director.  You know, he's involved with everything.  Like, you can tell it's his baby.  It's his movie.  He's picking everything apart.  He wants everything to be right.  And they respect him.  Like, even with Robert.  You know, what he says, everybody's listening to him.  Okay, so you want to try it this way?  Okay.  Like, people respect the fact that it was his thing.  Well, the Ben Stiller show, too.  I mean, he has success with directing people and with writing, obviously.  Because the Ben Stiller show is what kind of made him famous.  Yeah, yeah.  He had, like, a Janine and a lot of people on it. 
[02:11:30]  So he's not like a new guy to that.  That's a big box set.  That's pretty good.  Is it good?  It's funny.  I've never seen it.  Yeah, you see people pop up and it's like, holy fuck, man.  I didn't see it.  How was Leslie Nielsen?  Because Kevin did a scene with Leslie Nielsen, too.  In what movie?  Sick.  Leslie Nielsen, dude.  I did a superhero movie with Leslie Nielsen.  I did a scary movie three and four with Leslie Nielsen.  This is when I was in the, what's the name of those movies?  The spoof movie fans.  Yeah.  You know, those were the only ones that were hiring me at the time.  Leslie, you know, rest in peace.  I was telling Jim how he was the prankster. 
[02:12:00]  You know, but, you know, he was old, you know, so like his pranks weren't like, they  weren't like the new, they weren't like the new pranks, you know.  It's like, because it was Leslie Nielsen, you have respect for him and you would allow  him to do it.  But it's like, you saw everything coming.  Like he had the buzzer in his hand, but like he's coming to shake your hand.  The buzzer.  The buzzer's visible.  Like you see it, but you still shake it.  But he can't cover it off.  He's using old Bucks bunny gags.  But you don't want to be like, Leslie, there's a buzzer in your hand, so you still do it. 
[02:12:30]  It goes off, man.  You're like, oh, boy, you got me.  I got you.  Oh, shit.  He's got like the, that's great.  He's got the dirty gum.  Like, you know, it looks like regular gum, but you can see that it's not real, but you  still got to eat it.  What is this?  You pull it out and it's a little mouse trap thing that snaps on your finger.  The whoopee cushion.  The thing that you think I'm playing, like, I kid you not.  He had them all.  He walked into a novelty store and bought everything. 
[02:13:00]  He went to Spencer's Gifts.  But there's no way that you could not participate in it because it's Leslie.  Yeah, yeah.  The rubber spider, he'll put it on your, he'll put, like, you'll turn around and he'll put  it on your plate.  Oh, the spider.  Who put the spider out here?  What is this?  And it's like, it's not real.  Like, the way, that's the funny part.  Like, at this show, it's like, he goes, it's rubber.  Like, I don't want him going too far.  It's rubber.  Like, oh, Leslie.  You should have pulled younger pranks on him. 
[02:13:30]  Like, remove a manhole cover.  Or just do younger guy things.  Like a fucking blanket party, like full metal jacket.  Dude, that, I can honestly say, like, that is my, that is my most fondest memory of him.  It was like, everybody, like, everybody on set, like, I think was, like, did Leslie get  you with the, the, the whoopie yet?  Yeah.  No, he's like, yeah, he will.  Didn't he have a little electronic fart sound thing?  Yes.  All the time.  Yo, how do you know about that?  Yeah, because he did it on TV.  He was using it with everybody.  Listen, that was his thing. 
[02:14:00]  He'll put it in his bag and he has, like, the buttons.  He's like, oh, who's, who's got gas?  But for a while, I'm not going to lie, for that one, he got me.  I was confused with that one.  I was like, come on, man.  You're getting overboard, people.  Like, say excuse me.  I was like, I was like, getting mad.  I was like, I never smelled anything, which was weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Didn't I explain it?  Like, that's funny that you remember that.  Especially an old guy like that.  If he was farting, you'd be smelling some horrific, horrific shit.  You would know.  Yeah, honestly, one of the nicest guys ever, man.  At that age, still trying to keep up, like, you know, like, they would put his lines on 
[02:14:30]  the teleprompter for him, but he would get mad.  I got it.  I don't need the prompter.  I don't need that.  He'd mess it up.  Put, let me see it.  Bring it back.  What do you want from me?  Damn it.  I had it until you guys put it in front of me, until you constantly beat it in my head.  I already had it, but I wanted to do it.  Was he coherent, though?  Like, he was, uh...  Oh, he was.  Okay.  He knew exactly what it was.  Uh, still had his beats of funny.  Like, you know, his humor was, I don't think that you teach it, so I don't think it can  go away. 
[02:15:00]  You know, his improv skills, you know, the faces and things like that, he never lost a beat  with that.  Only thing, you know, they made sure that they didn't keep him on for too long.  His days weren't forever.  He could get out of there when he could, you know.  He, uh, only thing that made me laugh, though, like, uh, it would, like, be like, his trailer  would be here.  I've seen this with two people, uh, Leslie Nils and Eddie Murphy.  His trailer would be here.  Literally, the set would be maybe, maybe five feet away.  Like, like, his trailer's here, and you gotta shoot us five feet away.  A guy would pull up in a golf cart outside of his trailer. 
[02:15:30]  Leslie would sit on the back of the golf cart and drive five feet, and he would get up.  Come on.  And Eddie would go, all right, I'm on set.  Yeah, he would go, action!  Then we shoot, and, like, we stopped.  He wouldn't move.  And he didn't.  The cart would come back.  Sit back in the cart.  The cart would make a U-turn.  Holy shit.  Go back to the trailer.  Four and a half to five feet back to the trailer.  You said Eddie Murphy did that, too.  Eddie Murphy's was funny.  Same shit.  Eddie Murphy's, here's Eddie Murphy's.  All right, we're shooting Meet Dave, right?  It's another movie that Jim didn't do well.  All right, so we're doing a, we're doing a Meet Dave, right? 
[02:16:00]  So we're at the Statue of Liberty.  The site is where the Statue of Liberty is.  So, you know, we're on land, but for some reason, our trailers are here on land.  Eddie has a yacht.  He has a yacht in the water.  Like, you know, catered, full staff.  You know, it's crazy.  Like, it's ridiculous, right?  So they're like, okay, guys, we're almost ready.  We're getting ready to shoot.  So, like, walkie-talkie to, like, the PA that's on the yacht with Eddie. 
[02:16:30]  Okay, we're ready for Eddie.  On the yacht, the back of the yacht comes down, right?  The ramp connecting to land.  A Mercedes-Benz golf cart comes out.  Holy shit.  Eddie's on the back of it.  Literally, the cart, like, this is the sound you heard.  Vroom, vroom.  He was there.  He was there.  He was there.  He was there.  Like, there was no reason.  I was like, I guess.  Eddie, you know, Eddie got a clone, too. 
[02:17:00]  Like, he's got a guy that looks just like him.  And I never believed.  You know, Judah.  Judah used to tell me this all the time.  He was like, Kevin, he's got this guy named Virgil.  Virgil looks just like him.  Like, sometimes Eddie just leaves.  You know, when he leaves, you know, this guy's there, and they just use him for the shots.  He doesn't talk.  But he looks exactly like.  Get the fuck out of here.  Listen, I lie to you not.  This guy looks exactly like Eddie Murphy.  Like, from the face to his body section.  Virgil.  That's Virgil.  We're looking at a guy you would say is Eddie Murphy.  No, listen, when he takes his hat off. 
[02:17:30]  Listen, whatever look Eddie has for a movie, he has.  If Eddie gains weight, he's going to gain weight.  If Eddie loses it, he's going to.  I'm telling you, he works with Eddie in every movie he does.  So, we're filming, right?  Literally, this guy, Virgil, will be in his trailer all day.  Like, there's, like, movies just piled up.  Like, he just watches movies, right?  So, Eddie just leaves one day.  So, they're like, Eddie left, guys.  Let's get Virgil out here.  Just, like, when I tell you the most exciting moment in Virgil's life, like, the trailer  door, like, kicks open. 
[02:18:00]  He runs out.  He's like, what do you guys need me to do?  So, they tell him, but he wants to be an actor so bad, he's always trying to apply more  to the scenes.  But they got always pulling back.  They're shooting from the back, just walking.  Yeah, like, literally, they don't see his face.  It's literally, like, the side of his ear and the back of his head.  He's doing flips, like, to see it as, like, Eddie falls.  He's tumbling with the fall.  They're like, Virgil, no.  Just, Virgil, just fall down.  We don't even see the whole fall. 
[02:18:30]  Just please.  Like, just, all we need is just this one shot, Virgil.  He's like, yeah, but I'm thinking what Eddie would do.  I've been around Eddie for a long time, guys.  Like, trust me.  Like, literally, he lives for the moments when Eddie leaves.  And we would have to do scenes, like, sometimes Eddie would leave.  My scenes would be with Virgil.  Oh, you had to actually do your close-up for them?  Yeah, like, Eddie would go.  So, like, Eddie would be there.  That is fucking hysterical.  So, Virgil would be on the side, but he's, like, reading the lines, like,  Hey, man!  Like, he's doing, like, Eddie Murphy from 49ers.  Holy shit! 
[02:19:00]  Look, look, this is...  He definitely looks like Eddie Murphy.  Yeah, there is definitely an Eddie Murphy look.  Is that crazy?  Yeah, he really looks like him.  And from, like, the side...  He has his own share!  He gets his own share!  It says Virgil Carter.  Should you just say, not Eddie?  You'd absolutely get away with, like, a back quarter shot of him.  Do it in every movie.  Yeah.  Do it in every movie.  If Eddie goes, they'd shoot Virgil from the back.  And why does Eddie have to leave?  Well, sometimes he just goes.  And he just goes.  He's Eddie Murphy, man.  He's Eddie Murphy.  He's been doing movies since, what, 82 was the first...  He's just...  It's about, right? 
[02:19:30]  Fucking 30 years.  Sometimes he just goes.  I feel like playing a guitar.  He gets bored and goes, ah, I'm done for the day.  That's it.  Isn't he still one of the highest grossing movie guys, though?  Like, he's very underrated with his box office.  It's fucking still massive.  Yeah, they're huge.  They're huge.  People just...  People don't understand.  He went and catered to kids more now, but his numbers are still through the roof.  You have...  I don't like Kevin's famous friends.  It really bothers me.  Kevin has a lot of famous friends.  He's a lot of people, man.  I call him E.M.  Sure, for Eddie Murphy.  Oh.  He's an E.M.  No.  E.M.  I can't pronounce my M as well. 
[02:20:00]  He's been in some movies there.  Been in a lot of famous people.  I don't like it.  Hangs out with basketball players.  It really annoys me.  A lot of them.  I don't like to see my friends doing...  You want to see your friends doing well, but you really don't.  Like, you want to see, like, you know, it's...  Like, when Kevin did Soul Plane, I was happy that he did a movie.  But then me and Keith were teased him that nobody knew him.  So me and him walked around and were like, do you recognize him?  And nobody recognized him.  Now they do.  But back then, that was a fun day.  That was a fun day for you guys.  It hurt, too.  It hurt because I really thought people were like, come on, guys.  Nothing.  Nah, you've never seen him.  And then you didn't... 
[02:20:30]  Wasn't there, like, one black woman who recognized you, but she was annoyed about Soul Plane  and Keith was taking a run?  She told me the movie was bad.  But the movie was bad.  At least she recognized me, motherfucker.  You guys are honest.  You guys are honest.  Oh, it was great.  We were driving.  We were like, do you know him?  And they're like, no, we don't.  Chris, what pricks you guys are.  It's just a collection of pricks.  That's what I told you.  Y'all don't understand.  You take them away.  You take them away.  I don't have the thick skin that I have now.  Like, I feel like these guys were put in my life to prepare me for anything bad. 
[02:21:00]  For all the rapids that I've taken in L.A., I was prepared for.  My show getting canceled.  I bounced back like a champ.  What show?  I honestly don't even...  The Big House.  You remember that?  When I had the Big House in the TV show?  I went out to L.A.  We filmed six episodes.  We flew here to do the Upfronts.  They canceled me at the Upfronts.  Oh, my God.  Listen, like, literally, I'm about to walk on stage and announce my show.  Wait, Kevin.  No, they're going to pull you guys.  They don't want to take the show anymore.  Oh, wow.  That bad.  That bad.  Well, that is like a... 
[02:21:30]  Brutal.  From being up here to crashing.  Listen, let me tell you how things changed within an hour, okay?  We got to the hotel.  People are outside the hotel.  Flash and camera.  Kevin, congratulations, Mr. Hart.  Can we talk to you?  Hey, how do you feel?  Hey, it's a great feeling.  You know, I'm 24.  My own show.  This is great.  Producing, writing.  I couldn't ask for anything else.  Mr. Hart, over here, please.  One more.  Shut.  Like, I'm just getting to the hotel.  Yeah.  I'm walking out the hotel.  Congratulations.  I got the suit on. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, it's going to be a great day.  Big house.  Oh, people got signs up.  It's crazy.  I see, like, pictures of my headshot.  I'm like, this is...  I've arrived.  Here it is.  This is it.  This is the life.  Literally, I get there.  Cancel.  Kevin, we're not going to pick you up.  I walk off.  I get back to the hotel.  Those same people that were there said nothing to me.  Oh, shit.  Like, I was posing.  Like, you know, I'm expecting the pictures again.  Oh, shit.  Nobody said nothing.  They didn't lift their cameras up. 
[02:22:30]  Like, they let me know I had to check out by 10 a.m.  Mr. Hart, we booked your flight for early in the morning.  So, if you miss it, then you're responsible for the charges of paying for your flight.  You know, so...  What pricks.  Hey, I said, wow.  What network was it?  ABC.  Wow.  Why did they cancel you?  What did they replace you with?  It was...  They got rid of the whole TGIF thing.  I was...  We were going to be on TGIF.  We shot six episodes.  They told us we were picked up.  I was ecstatic. 
[02:23:00]  Canceled us.  Nothing.  Then we waited a year.  They picked us up for 13 episodes.  We shot seven of them.  Canceled the rest.  Was it just...  Was it bad or was it a good show?  You know, it wasn't bad, but it was...  It wasn't the time for that show.  What was it about?  It was based off my family.  Okay.  It was based off my family.  It was like the reverse of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  A guy that's coming from a poor situation.  No, a situation with money, but now he's going back to live with his family who's not doing that well.  You know?  At the time, it was funny. 
[02:23:30]  I had great actors.  I had Faze on Love, Keith David, myself, Arneeshia Walker.  I love fucking Keith David from Platoon.  Oh, dude.  Keith David, funniest...  By far, the funniest person I've ever worked with.  Oh, he would show up in the morning.  We didn't know if Keith was drunk or not.  Keith would fall asleep in the middle of rehearsal.  Literally, in the middle, we're doing lines.  Like, hey, come on, I don't have the money.  You got to give it to me.  You look over, Keith's sleep in the chair.  But he would wake up and always know his line. 
[02:24:00]  Like, Keith, I'm going to give you the money when I got to give it.  No, we got him.  He got us a crusader.  One of the nicest guys ever.  We had a good cast, man.  I've taken my rapids.  I've taken them.  But you take Norton, Voss, Keith, Patrice, Colin, you take those guys out of my life, I would have cried.  I would have buckled.  I would have been in the corner.  I wouldn't have bounce back.  You were calloused from head to toe.  It really is a great place for abuse, the seller.  I mean, we really, all of us kind of came out of there just really, like you said, like rape victims. 
[02:24:30]  Every one of us knows what it's like to be attacked on an intensely personal level.  No matter what's going wrong in your career, everybody's going to attack you for it.  No, it's true.  No matter what's going right, everybody's going to attack you for it.  You can do no right.  You can do no right at all.  Oh, yeah.  The better you do, the worse you'll fucking get shit on.  The more crap.  I remember when I first got Soul Plane.  I was like, Keith, I got it.  I'm starring in Soul Plane.  He's like, congrats, stupid.  Movie about a purple plane.  I was like, gee, thanks. 
[02:25:00]  That's good.  Thanks, Keith.  That's good.  Thank you, Keith.  Good choice.  Good take on that one, dummy.  Congrats on that.  Yeah.  That's great.  You're going to be great after that.  That's good.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Whose manager, you stupid?  Why would you do that?  He's still fucking waiting for them to call for that.  What was the movie Keith that replayed the...  The Rebound.  Oh, he's still hoping they do a sequel to Rebound.  Keith is such a...  He's so finished. 
[02:25:30]  He had a part as a young Earl of Manigot.  He played Earl in his early years.  He played his friend.  And Keith was like 30 playing a 14-year-old.  It's humiliating.  Keith in Rebound is humiliating.  There was no transformation in Keith's look.  He just cut his mustache to him.  He was 14 again.  No, Keith, you still look 35 in that movie.  Nothing about you looks like a kid.  He still had the old slang.  Like, ah, what are you jive turkeys doing? 
[02:26:00]  Keith, they didn't say that back then.  Nobody said jive turkeys.  I'll never forget that.  Keith has probably given me the most brutal trashes.  But when you look at them, it's funny.  Like, if you can't find the funny in it, then definitely you're in the wrong business.  And I think that was the funniest thing that we thrived off of, of people that couldn't take it.  You know, like, when we would tease certain people, they would get mad and, and, and really get angry.  Like, certain people.  How do you get into that business or want to be in that business, hang around with you guys, get shit on, and then take it, like, personally? 
[02:26:30]  Ah, they, it's, they hit low.  We hit low, though.  We, we definitely hit low.  Oh, yeah.  But that's, that, that makes it funnier.  I brought a fucking, I brought an older woman into the cellar one time.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What, are you crazy?  I didn't know.  Oh, no.  How old, Jerry?  I can only imagine.  I don't remember, but she was probably 15 years older than me, 20 years older than me.  And you were what?  Mid-20s at the time? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, she was, she didn't even live locally.  She was like, I think a West Coast person was in town.  I'm like, oh, they'll come take it to the cellar.  Ugh.  It was not good.  No, huh?  It was.  They'll take everything.  Oh, they'll take everything.  They'll take everything.  They're just fucking making diaper jokes.  It's the second she wasn't looking.  What the fuck is?  Because you were always, you just, like, what happened is you'd sit at the table and Patrice  would be there or Geraldo, Nick, and all, you know, Colin.  And then you would just wait, like, everybody was kind of holding on, but everybody knew 
[02:27:30]  it was coming.  And you're trying to, like, you're trying to just stave off the attack because you know  she's going to be humiliated.  They're circling.  Dude, what?  It's like sharks.  It's like sharks.  We keep walking around the table and dropping stuff on purpose.  Just dropping stuff, looking at him.  Hey, Jim.  That's nice.  Were you sweating just like you knew?  I knew it was coming.  It was horrendous.  One of the best beatings ever.  Were you there for the Bill Burr beating when he took the fucking, the greatest beating? 
[02:28:00]  Not only was I there, Bill tried to fight it off for so long, trying to fight back, and  eventually he just sat there and everybody, everybody just kept doing it.  I remember I told Bill he was eating chicken as if he, as if he just beat cancer.  He took, he was taking a small, it's like, he was taking a smallest sickly bite.  I said, Bill, you eat the fucking piece of chicken?  Like, he, like, it literally took Bill three minutes to eat a buffalo wing.  We found out, who ratted him out? 
[02:28:30]  I think it was, uh, it wasn't Patrice.  It was Patrice.  It was Keith, myself, Kevin, Patrice.  Somebody told on him.  It was the Yankees, uh, Diamondbacks World Series, 2001, I think.  And we found out Bill got a gig performing comedy on a bus that was taking people to the  game.  No fucking way.  He was doing a road.  No fucking way.  He was a bus coming.  And Bill, and Bill was getting, the pain he was getting was that he got to go to the, 
[02:29:00]  to the game.  And I don't remember who teased him or who first mentioned it, but it's one of the, was  it Bobby?  Did Bobby tell us?  I don't remember.  Somebody told us, but when I say we beat the shit out of Bill verbally, it was one of the  greatest all time beatings ever given to a comedian.  It would have to be with that situation.  It got to the point where Bill had nothing to do but attack other people's careers.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what job, what gig are you getting?  Yeah, shut up, stupid.  About to go get on the, go get on the MTA and tell some jokes. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Do you remember some of the lines?  No, but I know we made fun of him.  Is it weird performing when you're not going backwards?  That should be a DVD, man.  The comedians, of course, everyone did the fucking walking down the steps, performing  joke and fucking.  Did it make you, did it make you stop your jokes when it got announced the bus stop?  Hold on, Bill, for a second.  Just wait for a second.  Do you know you're bombing and people are like, eh, pushing the button over?  It was fucking, dude, it was literally a 45 minute assault.  And Bill just got mad at one point.  Hey, at least my parents don't drink.  It was like, like that type of thing. 
[02:30:00]  It just got ugly.  How long was your set?  Ten stops?  Dude, it was, it was, it was a great.  It was really, that was really, really brutal.  That is brutal.  I've written to some good ones.  I remember I brought a girl in one time.  She was actually good looking.  Not a bad looking girl, man.  But she had this hat on.  She had a hat.  That's all it takes.  This hat.  Like, I'm telling you, like, her body was nice.  She had a nice ass.  It was cute in the face.  She had a hat.  And it was like, what are you doing with a Russian spy?  Everybody kept, everybody kept sneaking around like as if they were. 
[02:30:30]  Everybody kept, they kept doing like spy-like shit.  Just creeping up.  It's like, all you can do is like, dude, she's a good one.  And I'm bringing her in it.  Sweetie, look, take your hat off for a second.  Show her.  She's like, why?  What's wrong?  Like, she's doing stuff to amp it up.  She's like putting the hat backwards.  Like, oh, Jesus.  It's no beating it, man.  I can honestly say the best times of my life were probably at the Comedy Cellar.  I remember my birthday.  Keith got me drunk.  You know, I was 21. 
[02:31:00]  I just turned 22.  It was my birthday.  But, you know, I never drank there.  Even though we did, it wasn't really a thing to do.  Like, we didn't sit around and get drunk.  Like, I can honestly say people cared about their craft.  You know, it was about what we did and giving each other shit.  So, it's my birthday.  Keith's like, stupid.  What do you want?  I said, man, I want a drink, man.  I said, it's my birthday.  I'm 22.  It's 2 in the morning.  I'm going to drink.  So, I'm getting shots.  I remember Sherrod.  He's taking some shots with me.  It's just me, Keith, Big J, right? 
[02:31:30]  So, we leave.  I'm drunk as hell.  I get home.  Keith drops me off.  I get out of the car.  He touches the car seat.  The passenger car seat is wet.  He's like, stupid.  What did you spill in my seat, stupid?  I'm pissed in his car seat.  I pee in my bed.  All I remember is walking to my door.  Stupid as fucking piss.  You pissed in my car seat, stupid.  At the top of his lungs, he's yelling, 
[02:32:00]  What the fuck are you doing?  Pissing in my car seat.  You're going to fucking clean this in the morning, stupid.  But I remember him holding his hand.  He didn't want to do anything else with his hand.  He put his hand in my piece.  I didn't even clean it.  I made him deal with it.  He called me in the morning.  You're going to clean this out today.  Ah, go fuck yourself.  You get it.  Exactly.  Clean it, older man.  That's what happens.  You want to act like I'm a fucking kid going to Vietnam.  You want to buy your war buddy a drink?  That's what you get.  Clean up the fucking afterbirth. 
[02:32:30]  This is nothing fucking better than when, even here, when we just have all the guys in,  and it just turns into a feeding frenzy.  It's the best, man.  Of people just shitting on.  No one could, you're like, I want to say something, but I know I'll just get shit on it.  By saying, your confidence level gets knocked down to zero with any jokes that you have,  so you blurt a line out, and if it gets a laugh, you're like, oh fuck, when it gets  nothing, you just sit back and take the fucking pain.  Well, that's why I address it. 
[02:33:00]  You know, when you do something that is not going to get the reaction to you that you'd  expect it to, address it off the bat.  Hey, look at your face.  Whatever, guys.  They're not going to work.  All of them are going to work.  So, whatever.  I'll tell you what's funny.  Some people you couldn't tease, like when you talk about Tom Popper, no matter what  you said about Tom, Tom's response just made you not want to have fun anymore.  Tom, what's wrong with your shirt?  God, it's horrible.  Yeah.  All right, Tom, forget it.  I put it on this morning. 
[02:33:30]  Forget it, Tom.  Yeah, forget it.  There's an explanation for it?  That's fun.  Just a shirt.  I brought it.  It was two for one.  All the rest are in the laundry.  He has a logical answer.  What's with the shirt?  Everything was a drawn out answer.  You really need to go shopping.  Or they ask you real questions about it, like your shirt stinks.  They're like, what?  Two pockets.  Is that wrong?  I don't know.  I didn't analyze it.  I just was making fun of you.  There's nothing better than a misplaced pocket on clothing, though.  That will start an attack faster than anything.  A fucking misplaced pocket.  Why you got a pocket on your thighs, stupid? 
[02:34:00]  Because there's no way to...  Bob Kelly came in wearing security guard pants.  You remember the night that fucking Fatso had on security guard pants?  And we brutalized him.  He had a stripe down the side of his pants.  No, he did not.  It was a security guard stripe.  He thought he looked good.  He was so attackable.  He walked in there with those pants.  The stripe down the side.  It was like a darker color.  It was like blue pants with a darker colored stripe.  What was he thinking?  You can't take them off.  That was the socks, shoes, and pants. 
[02:34:30]  You can't take your clothing off.  What are you stripping tonight, fat boy?  What are you doing tonight?  With your reflective safety stripe on your pants, Bobby.  Bobby, I got mad at Bobby because I left for a year.  Bobby, I came back.  Bobby was 360.  I said, Bobby, where did you get fat?  Why?  He said, yes, yes.  He couldn't really talk.  He wasn't breathing right.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Food still.  You would talk to him.  He'd start chewing food from yesterday in his mouth. 
[02:35:00]  It's in a pouch.  Yeah.  In his mouth.  Holy fuck.  Bobby was one that would get mad.  Bobby would take it for a while and get pissed.  Bobby was a fun one to fuck with.  Bobby would get pissed after a while.  That's the fucking thing.  I've seen that happen here.  Where we start nailing him on certain things and he'll get mad.  Bobby would get pissed.  Bobby was fun.  He's much better.  Bobby really.  Back when he first came around, he would get angry faster than most guys.  Really?  Now Bobby can kill us.  You're right.  Patrice can fucking deal it out. 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Patrice can fucking rip you to shreds.  He's definitely in my top two.  Yeah.  He's fucked.  Let me tell you.  Patrice came out to L.A.  Right now.  L.A.  L.A. comics are nothing like us here in New York.  We learned that a long time ago.  Listen, I live out there, but I'm not on the circuit out there.  I can't.  I thank God that I'm able to tour and go out because I can't.  I can't deal.  Those guys, it's the most sensitive group.  They don't interact like this.  They don't fuck with each other. 
[02:36:00]  What's the core group out there?  Because we know the core group in New York.  You don't even know.  It really isn't one.  You don't even.  I don't think it exists.  There's no such place as a coffee shop.  There's no hangout.  There's no bullshit and fucking with each other.  Everybody's going on stage, but in their mind, every time they step on stage, it's to make it.  All right.  This is the time.  Some producer's going to see me, and I'm going to have my show.  That's the attitude out there.  Completely different.  Completely different.  So Patrice comes out.  First of all, let me tell you what Patrice does.  Patrice stays in my apartment. 
[02:36:30]  I'm in a two-bedroom apartment.  At the time, I'm married.  So I'm like, Patrice, you can stay with us.  It's no big deal.  I put Patrice in the guest room.  So one day, I come home.  I'm going to give you guys a full-fledged.  I don't give a shit.  Patrice, fuck him.  He can give me shit later.  So I come home.  It's quiet.  I don't hear anything in the room.  So I'm like, Patrice, you here?  Because the rental car was in the garage.  I don't know.  I guess not.  I go in the back.  The computer's on.  Patrice is in front of the computer. 
[02:37:00]  I swear to God, I cannot make this up.  There's just some baby oil on the desk.  Like, Patrice is big, so I can't see it in front of the computer.  He's got the headphones on attached to the computer, right?  So there's porn.  So Patrice is fucking like his, I guess he's got his dick out the boxer hole.  He didn't want to go with the full, he didn't want to go with the full, full damn move.  So I see the arm, I see the arm working, right?  So my wife, she's about to come in. 
[02:37:30]  I'm like, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  I'm like, Patrice, you can't hear me because he's got the fucking headphones on.  So I smack the headphones off his head.  I say, stupid, you beating your dick in the fucking office?  He's like, is your wife here?  So I'm like, hey, man, just cut the shit off, Patrice.  So listen, the most humiliating move I've ever seen Patrice do, he wanted to finish.  And she's like, just get out. 
[02:38:00]  I said, you're not even going to fucking stop, man.  You know, his back was so big, so I couldn't see anything, right?  So he's like, just get out, man.  I'll be done in a second.  Literally, this is his words.  I'll be done in a second, right?  Come in your fucking office?  So I leave.  Listen, this is what makes Patrice retreat.  Patrice comes out and liver masters.  He said, look, look, guys, there's nothing to say to really make that situation better.  It is what it is.  It happened.  So let's just forget about it.  So that night, me and Patrice go out, right? 
[02:38:30]  So we're out.  We're going to the comedy club.  So I'm with Patrice.  Patrice is looking.  He's just looking like, you know how Patrice does it.  His nose and his bottom lip meet.  He's frowning his face up at these comics.  Like, literally, he's just looking at them.  He's pointing to guys.  He doesn't even know the guys.  He's like, oh, God.  Like, he's doing the thing.  Like, you know, for the listeners, I know you can't see me, but he's like pointing his finger.  He's giving them the look.  He's like, what are you? 
[02:39:00]  Why are you?  So I'm looking and I'm like, Patrice.  I said, you know, these guys, they're not, you know, they don't know our world.  They don't they don't fuck around.  You know, the same way we do.  He's like, I don't care.  He literally starts attacking.  It's like it's like a man with a rifle.  Just picking people off.  He's like, look at what do you.  Oh, God.  Look at his appearance.  This guy.  He said, what you just talked about on stage made me go. 
[02:39:30]  These guys get mad.  Who the fuck are you, man?  Who do you think you are?  Coming right.  He's like, your voice.  No matter what they say, his response.  I'm the only one.  I am on the floor.  I'm cramping.  I'm laughing so fucking hard.  He's like, what is your notepad for? 
[02:40:00]  What are you writing down?  What do you think?  Did you take notes of what you just did?  Let me see it.  Let me see your book.  The guy gives me the book.  Patrice throws it.  Throws his book.  It's like this guy's.  It's his heart.  This guy's hard work.  Like he's been sitting there jotting down bits all day.  Patrice jumped it.  Hit a bottle of water somewhere across the room.  Patrice.  He's ruthless and hysterical when he fucking jumps on someone.  Nobody matches Patrice's funny anger.  Nobody.  Nobody at all.  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  No, he will rip you to pieces and it will be hysterical. 
[02:40:30]  And with that, Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  Patrice.  Good morning.  We got Kevin Hart in studio.  And he's telling us what's going on.  I told him about when I caught you beating off in my fucking apartment.  You told him what?  When you did what?  When I caught you jerking off in my apartment.  Oh, that was a long time ago.  It's still a funny fucking story.  That's before Kevin Hart stopped talking to me. 
[02:41:00]  I wonder why he wouldn't want to talk to you.  We haven't talked in about five years.  And then I think that was the last time we talked about Jerk Talk.  No, we talked after that.  We talked after that.  I've seen you after that.  This is when Kev...  This is the stories before Kev stopped running the other way.  I don't mind that.  I don't mind that because his career is important.  But when I see you and I come walking towards you and he sees white people near him, he runs in front of white people. 
[02:41:30]  And I hear you guys cappling up a storm.  Of course, five years ago, this is how I know Kev is famous.  Because Jim Norton has given him the famous laugh.  And Kev five years ago was just a little nigger.  He was a niggler.  I hear a story how famous Kev is.  This is how famous Kev is.  And I didn't know that.  Because I don't have his number anymore. 
[02:42:00]  Now, tell me if this is true.  Because this has me almost shaking in my ego boots.  This fucker, there's a tour I hear coming up.  Is this public knowledge yet, Kev?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Holy fuck balls.  This is how big you're talking.  This is how famous this person is you're talking to now.  The thing is called, you know, Bernie Mac passed away. 
[02:42:30]  So the Kings of Comedy can't really do the full tour anymore.  Right.  So I hear it's going to be a new Kings of Comedy tour.  But there's no Bernie Mac.  So here's the thing.  There is no, like, fourth person to take Bernie Mac's place.  It is called Three Kings and a Heart Tour.  And Kev is the closer.  I didn't realize this shit. 
[02:43:00]  I win the fuck.  I win.  Here's what I want to know.  What put you over the top, Kev?  Because we sit here and we cry, wondering what the fuck put you to that level.  Was it Soul Plane?  You know the sad part, Trees?  Wasn't it fucking so seriously funny?  I don't know.  I'm going to tell you what.  I'm going to tell you what it was.  I think it was probably seriously funny, but I'm going to tell you some real shit, though. 
[02:43:30]  Here's the thing.  With the Three Kings and a Heart Tour, and this is going to fuck you up.  You know, I talk about it.  I don't give a shit.  They said it.  They wanted to do.  We were just supposed to do the one show, All-Star Weekend.  Right?  That's what we were supposed to do.  And after that, they were talking about taking it out.  So Steve Harvey was like, you know, I don't want to really do it because Bernie's not here.  It's hard for me to go on stage like that without Bernie.  He said, you know, so he didn't really feel comfortable.  DL said he wanted to do it. 
[02:44:00]  And I was like, well, I only wanted to do it for the All-Star Weekend because it was that big.  So when they started talking about the other dates, before Steve even said that, I was like, I don't want to do the whole tour because I don't want to be a part of that particular brand.  Like, I said, that brand has already been done.  Shut the fuck up, nigga.  Let me tell you, this horse shit, he didn't want to do it because this motherfucker is the ticket seller.  Pretty much.  Yes!  So why join a less successful tour? 
[02:44:30]  That was it.  I'm sorry.  These are things I have to find out because after this horse shit phone call, we'll never talk again.  Trees!  Trees!  First of all, Trees, in my defense, in my defense, Patrice, my number, my fucking number hasn't changed, Patrice.  My fucking number hasn't changed, okay?  Now, if you want to be honest, you disappeared, Patrice.  You did.  You see this motherfucker?  He said his number didn't change. 
[02:45:00]  If I go find his old number, it will not only go do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do- 
[02:45:30]  That's what they call me on the streets.  And by the way, as much as I try to hate on Kev, that fucking seriously funny had me in tears.  Thank you, man.  That shit was fucking funny.  Patrice, Patrice, hold on one second.  I'm dialing Kevin's old number right now.  And the phone's not ringing in front of us?  Wait, no.  How old is it?  How old is it?  Wait, no.  In my defense, Jim definitely doesn't have the number, Patrice.  Okay.  Let's see.  Which one of these is it?  Hey, Jim, don't fucking call me. 
[02:46:00]  Listen, let me tell you.  Listen, let me show you how old the number is, Patrice.  Hold on, Patrice.  It's not real.  Patrice, Jim has an 888 number in his phone for me.  That used to be my beeper when I first came to New York.  He's got 888-664.  He's got my beeper number.  That's how long.  That's good news that Norton was never really your friend.  That makes me happy.  I had the old cells.  Look, the time I jerked off at his house, man, those were the good old days. 
[02:46:30]  He did catch me.  And I have to admit, I wasn't beating off at his house because Kev, at the time, was the  first one to have a Mac.  And the porn just streamed.  I was lonely.  The porn was streaming.  And I got caught.  But, you know, this is a fun conversation because I ain't talked to the nigga in a long time.  He caught me.  Patrice caught me fucking in my garage.  Me and my wife.  Listen, me and my wife was fucking in the car because Patrice was upstairs.  So Patrice came downstairs. 
[02:47:00]  He said, he called me.  Like, he waited like 45 minutes to call me.  He said, uh, little dummy.  Little dummy.  Were y'all just fucking in the car?  I said, yeah.  Well, that's no big deal because Kev had a bed in his house that he needed a ladder to  climb up to.  He needed a small step stool to get in it.  And his wife used to fuck all the time.  And that's not even the story.  That's all they do is because this nigga's zero.  And the other legendary thing about little Kev is he has a dick the size of a baby arm. 
[02:47:30]  It's really depressing.  Oh, you've seen it?  No, but I've heard it depresses me.  And I don't even need to say the no homo thing.  It's just like, you know, if, if, if, if, you know, girls are like, you know, hey, hi,  how are you?  And the motherfucker might be like, hey, and it's like, hey, and he just goes, look, I  got a big dick.  If I'm fucking a girl, I'll actually go, you should meet my friend, Kevin. 
[02:48:00]  We could be hanging out with prostitutes and Kev could pull his dick out and ruin everything  even for the prostitutes.  Cause now they're like, well, if not, if everybody's dick ain't that, it was a collective.  Oh, but it's a dick to have if you're going to be famous, nigga.  Hey, look, it was good to talk to you.  And, and, uh, Anthony, are we, we're doing this thing coming up? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  We should talk about that real fast.  We're going to Foxwoods.  Poker Tournament.  This Friday.  We're going to play some poker and fucking hang out with our wonderful listeners.  Uh, not really.  I, I, I downloaded something on the iPad to try to learn.  I don't want to be a sucker.  Nah, you'll be, you'll be great.  Yeah.  It's a poker tournament at Foxwoods Resort and, uh, Casino.  It's, uh, this Friday.  While, uh, you're talking to your special guest.  I know I've been downgraded to I'll see you Friday.  Hey, Patrice. 
[02:49:00]  I love Patrice, man.  I hear everybody having a fucking great time.  I can come down.  I'm not doing nothing.  I'm retired.  Patrice.  We should have had Patrice in today.  You should have brought him fucking in.  I don't know why we didn't.  Patrice.  Hey, for real, don't be an asshole right now.  I'm just serious.  Jim, Jim's got your shit right.  My, what, my number?  Yeah.  Don't call me, nigga.  No, I'm fucking, no, I'm calling.  Let's go, let's go eat today.  For real.  I ain't seeing you, man.  I'm not going to eat with you, no.  See, this is what he says.  This is, listen.  He's difficult.  No, he's very difficult.  We all know that Patrice is very difficult.  You know how hard it is for him to turn down a meal? 
[02:49:30]  We're all on the same page.  Patrice is difficult.  Don't fucking be my friend on the radio, you cock fucker.  I want you to Twitter.  A story of me drugging off to your fucking motherfuckers.  Don't call me today.  Make it three days so I know it ain't bullshit.  Three days.  You know what?  Three days from right now.  I'm not playing with you on Friday, Kevin Hart.  I'm calling you on Friday.  All right.  Hey, Patrice.  Why are you in town? 
[02:50:00]  What show that had to have seven more shows added?  No, dude.  Honestly, I'm in town.  I got to do 106 and Park and all that stuff while I'm here.  So I just loaded some.  What is 106 and Park?  It's a show on BT.  It's a show on BT.  It's a show on BT.  It's a show on BT.  It's a show on BT action.  He was a goddamn pickpocket.  He was a pickpocket yesterday.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there's a story there.  There's a story there after Patrice hangs up. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Pickpocket.  A pickpocket.  You know what?  I can't play.  I can't play like that.  No, no.  He's saying like, when did it happen?  That's what he's saying.  Yeah, Kev wasn't a fucking pickpocket.  Actually, right.  I have to say that.  I'm joking around.  But little Kev, I swear to God, this is so shocking to me because I'm telling you, we  were, you know, we all were close, but, you know, life makes things go separately.  So, but, nigga, I wake up and I'm like, what the, this nigga is that fucking famous? 
[02:51:00]  And I'm proud and jealous at the same time.  It'd be nice to hear you got stabbed or something.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's what you were talking about.  That's how this shit is.  That's how it is.  Remember we just talked about that?  I said, that's what makes them, that's what makes them amazed.  Like, be honest.  And Patrice, you got to understand, you see, since he's been on the air, everything that  we said is true.  And he goes, this is the relationship we have.  I haven't talked to Patrice in a while, but when I talk to him, it's that fast you pick 
[02:51:30]  back up.  Do I miss the big son of a bitch?  I'm not going to lie to you.  I fucking do.  Why have I went different?  I got fucking kids now.  All right?  I got kids.  They know I'm out in fucking LA.  But Patrice is as...  You don't want to touch him, William.  I don't trust you around my baby's, Trace.  I don't trust you around my baby's.  Patrice, are you as disgusted as I am right now with, I miss the big lug?  He's a...  I miss the big lug.  I'm glad Jimmy pointed that out.  He is masterfully, masterfully Hollywood. 
[02:52:00]  I can't stay mad at him because he's funny and he's masterful at Hollywood.  I wish I could take a page on him, but the thing is, and the other thing I'm hoping happens  is that he gets old and he starts to be cute and he starts to look like Gary Coleman.  I go through a horrible, cute guy who can't jump on the floor and spit on his head no more. 
[02:52:30]  I can't fucking wait to the downfall of his little prick.  Hey, Patrice, listen, before you hang up, listen to what I'm talking about that had me in tears.  Dude, do you remember when we were in LA and we went out, we was at the comedy clubs,  you were so disgusted with the circuit and the people, you just started bashing the comics,  but you were doing it.  I have no bridges left in LA.  But see, I retired.  People don't know.  I retired, but I'm going to have to come back. 
[02:53:00]  I retired.  But I think I'm going to just say fuck it and try to burn my last bridge  because I've been trying to really do the right thing, but they just don't let you.  I'm going to fucking start.  I look for this guy.  I can't name his name.  I forgot this fucker's name, but it's one of these new, unfunny, funny guys.  Like these guys that, you know, I'm going to say this, but it's not supposed to be funny,  but it could be, but if you don't laugh, it's no pressure.  I love it.  Like, I'm done with these fucking people, 
[02:53:30]  and I'm going to stop this shit before I go because I'm starting to get headaches too much  and I know I'm out the way.  I'm going to burn my last fucking bridge and it's going to be spectacular.  I swear to fucking God.  That's awesome.  But at least, at least, I'm telling you, at fucking least,  I got to talk to this nigga again because I'm telling you, I'm very surprised  because usually when white people are around,  Kev, don't talk to me, man.  I'm telling you, still run away from me. 
[02:54:00]  This is how little he thinks of you guys.  He realizes nobody in this room can help him.  He knows that.  We have nothing to offer.  It's not stupid.  Hey, who started that?  Patrice, who started that Bill Burr beating?  Who started that Bill Burr bus beating?  Oh, you know what it was?  I'll tell you what it is.  Jim Norton is really, you got to be careful because another thing,  Kev is like this too, and I think it's that Napoleon complex thing. 
[02:54:30]  It's a really, Kev, this jerk-off story started one day.  We used to go downstairs back in the day at the cellar when guys would be performing.  Oh, right.  And we would sit there and all sit in the front row and stare at Jim Norton.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  We're getting into Kevin and Mike, man.  Oh, that's brutal.  Jesus.  But this was the test.  I mean, we were brutal. 
[02:55:00]  We used to have a hack court.  We would put up somebody's act on court.  They did it to me.  Hack court.  I love it.  Hack court.  Really?  You put a bit on trial.  Dude, they would do it all the time.  I had a joke.  We went downstairs and we went downstairs and sat in front of him,  and he was flustered.  We was getting him.  And he just caught me jerking off in his house.  This mother, this is how you know he fucking started imitating me jerking off, 
[02:55:30]  like jerking off at his house.  Damn sure did.  I pushed the button.  I didn't hear that.  He started cutting out of that.  It was nasty.  It hurt me.  He had to do what he had to do because he fucking had to get out of that situation.  By any means necessary.  Now, here's this fucker, Jim.  Bill was talking about something, and Jim, oh, Jim said something, and Bill said something to Jim, 
[02:56:00]  and Jim didn't like what Bill said to him.  Like, he said it was going to be embarrassing.  And Jim was going to get a fucking beating for what happened, and I forgot what it was.  But Jim goes in front of me, Kev, Keith, and I think it was another guy.  Bob Kelly?  Bobby was there for the bus beating.  It was Kelly, but it was me and Lil' Kev that was giving the beating with the bus. 
[02:56:30]  But Norton goes, at least I'm not performing on a bus for you.  That's right.  I did not remember.  No.  That's right.  Patrice, you're 100% right because Bill was going at it with you, Jim, and he hit you with something.  He hit you good, and we were about to attack you.  You're right, Patrice.  We were about to jump on your ass.  And Jimmy had an atomic bomb.  And Jimmy had it in his back pocket.  I did not remember that.  He threw a neutron bomb, and everybody said, what? 
[02:57:00]  I remember that.  We said, what?  I put it on a bus for 10.  Great, great, great deflection.  And to this day, there was three beatings, four beatings of all time.  And I'm telling you, Norton was a part of two of my biggest laughs in my life.  But this bus beating.  Bus beating is legendary.  Of Kev.  Because what happened is you feed Kev the important lines, and he would take it to the next level. 
[02:57:30]  And what the whole thing was for an hour was, well, what happens if you start bombing?  And then where do you come from, and where do you go when you're finished?  We said, where did they?  We said, where did they bring you up from?  We said, Bill.  Bill was behind the bus driver.  Bill Burr.  And he just takes a step out.  He was just sitting in the front seat.  There's no way for them not to know that he was the comic. 
[02:58:00]  We was like, how do you sneak on stage, Bill?  Oh, my God.  And they said, if he started bombing, what he would do is go, after one joke bombs, he'd  just look out the window and go, if you look to your list.  Oh, shit.  It was an all-timer, but, oh, man, good reminiscence.  And then is it, is it, was it over, like, the public address system?  Like, yeah, I went to the container store with my girlfriend. 
[02:58:30]  Norton, you don't remember, Norton just said, you're, at least I'm not doing it.  Jimmy knew his life was being threatened.  I swear to God, but Jesus is not lying.  He's not lying.  Jimmy, you did.  I didn't remember that.  I certainly believe it.  No, wait a minute. 
[02:59:00]  But Bill looked at you.  Like, how could you do that?  Like, how could you do that?  Why?  I don't have to do.  I remember when they were talking about the court, like when he was talking about, you  know, we put your jokes on display.  They came downstairs.  This is some true shit.  They did this to me a couple times.  Like, you know, I was the, I was like, if it were a fraternity, I was the guy that was  just trying to get in and they, they would do like the, the most brutalist shit to me.  Right.  So, you know, I'm at the cellar, I'm at the cellar.  And at the time I've been doing the spots for a while. 
[02:59:30]  My spots were never great spots.  I'm, you know, one 30 in the morning.  I'm, I'm dead ass, but we're all there.  We're giving each other shit.  They come sit in the front row.  I remember Patrice and Keith on my mom, this shit.  When I say like it, it's, it, I was so mad, but you can't, you can't show that  side every joke I said, they would, they would go, ah, right on the punchline, right  on the punchline, but the audience, the audience didn't know, like, you know, it's only a good 
[03:00:00]  20 people in there.  So the audience had no idea who they were.  Every fucking joke I did, like Keith, I remember hearing Keith's voice was sitting  like, ah, nah, come on.  Like, listen, it was so, but I can't stop like the cameras are on, so I can't look like  I'm not taking this shit serious.  So I'm like trying to, trying to trudge through.  And then you ever see the guy, I remember it was a midget joke.  I had the joke about a cross-eyed midget.  Oh my God. 
[03:00:30]  I said, he was robbing me.  Can I just say one thing without, I hope one day that I have a day in this, in this,  in this goddamn business, but I will say, to not sound like Uncle Patrice, this is the  one thing I want you to take to your Hollywood friends, Kev, is that they owe us, me, Kev,  me, Keith, Norton, they owe us Kevin Hart, meaning we would have, they would have never  heard the name Kevin Hart if we didn't make him change it from Kev the little bastard. 
[03:01:00]  Little Kev the bastard.  Little Kev the bastard.  So my name is Little Kev the bastard.  Tell him.  So think, I want all white people to think.  Dude, I wish, I wish there was a part of me, I wish I could deny half of this shit.  I wish I could be like, fuck you, Patrice, you son of a bitch, you don't know shit.  I wish I could.  Listen, my name was Little Kev the bastard.  I was the only person in the New York circuit that was coming up with music.  Listen, like, you know, like at the cellar, they announce you, the crowd just claps. 
[03:01:30]  Listen, keep in mind, these crowds are intimate for your listeners.  These are, these are audiences of 25, 50, you know, maybe, maybe 70 on the weekend.  Right, sure.  You know, it's just applause.  I was the only person that came up to, uh, uh, it's your birthday by Luke.  Uh, it looks like, like, like, like the speakers were, the speakers were, they can't handle music.  The speakers were never prepared for music at all.  They're rattling.  Keith, Keith, Keith saw the potential. 
[03:02:00]  We, we said, Keith, take this little Philly mess and go back to Philly with him.  And Keith fucking, Keith said, no, this motherfucker's 20.  And, and, and he fucking, Kevin, Keith did, you know.  He did not see potential.  Keith wanted to be a mentor once in his career.  And he figured he could bully little Kev.  He did.  He wanted to be a mentor.  Because Kev probably for a while listened to Keith.  Like, really?  You think I should do that?  Yeah, you should do that.  And Keith had some respect from somebody.  Keith.  You know what Keith is in the business?  Keith is like an old grandfather who has a lot of children. 
[03:02:30]  And he's waiting for one to just let him stay in his house.  I told him.  I already told Keith I'm not coming back for him.  I've told him several times.  I said, I like you where you are.  I said, I want you to keep driving that fucked up Ford Focus.  I said, I hope you, I hope they get to, I said, I hope the IRS, I said, I hope the IRS.  I said, I hope the IRS doesn't let you write your toll charges off.  I said, stop. 
[03:03:00]  That's Keith's biggest, that's his biggest receipt thing for the IRS.  I said, I hope they don't accept him.  I like you where you are.  But I got to give him.  Old laughs, man.  Hey, Opie, these are, I'm telling you, these are old laughs, nigga.  I'm fucking loving it today, pal.  Hell yeah.  Hey, Patrice, by the way, Jimmy, Jimmy's heading out to L.A. tomorrow.  You want to come in?  Tomorrow?  Shit, you niggas is making me commit this shit on the radio.  All right, I'll be here.  Well, I know.  That's why I do it this way.  Push on the spot.  No, we'd love to have you in tomorrow. 
[03:03:30]  Jimmy's flying out today, right?  Stay mad at Kev.  I wanted to stay mad at this nigga for not talking to me for five years.  We should have had you in today.  I wish he was in today.  I didn't know the history between all you guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just didn't think of it.  Yeah, man.  The Kev is Kev, but he was the smart one.  He fucking left.  That motherfucker.  It was one.  He got one good joke and got a plane and got the fuck out of here.  I've been wasting around here for 19 years.  Just waiting for your plane. 
[03:04:00]  It hit me.  Yeah, I'm not doing nothing tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  We just made you look bad.  I'm sorry.  You like to come in?  Patricia should have said, I got to check my schedule.  Yeah.  I know you.  You could have lied.  I can't.  I got a call back.  Yeah.  You could have said something.  I don't know.  I don't hang in the back fucking warm room at the Penn State and just sit in bitches  of fucking 45-year-old Ralph Macchio. 
[03:04:30]  I was fucking home crying.  I was like fucking pretending.  This kid Troy calls me.  He goes, hey, Patrice, this is Troy from LA.  What do you want?  I'm busy.  Yeah.  Kevin Hart's on the phone.  I don't know.  Yeah, put me on.  I'm like, what the fuck am I doing?  Anyway, Kev, man.  Congratulations, brother, because I haven't talked to you in a while.  Thank you, Trace.  Hey, Friday.  You said I got three days.  I got three fucking days.  I'm going to call you in three days.  I'm not bullshitting.  I think you hung up.  I just want to take that.

[03:06:00]  Unbelievable time.  Unbelievable time, man.  I'm glad that you guys had me.  Yeah, Kevin's one of those guys, you know, fucking...  We can't probably get to talk about Voss, too.  But Voss was a part of that whole thing, too.  Voss was mentioned a few times in there.  Toxic shit environment, of course.  Yeah, of course.  And you got to talk about the poker thing real fast, man.  Yes!  We got a big day this Friday.  That's this Friday, yeah.

[03:06:30]  Patrice is going to be there.  I think Patrice is trying to learn how to play poker from, like, online.  He's online, kind of trying to learn.  I really play.  It's going to be...  I'm serious with poker.  Yeah, so am I.  I'm really serious with poker.  Yeah.  Really?  I love the game.  I'm really serious with poker.  Love the game.  And going to be down there.

It's just get there.  And he plays some blackjack, too, Kevin Hart.  Blackjack?  Ooh.  Yeah, I just donated probably a light bill.  Oh, so you like the casinos, huh?  Yeah, I go to casinos.  I don't like to go because of my, you know, whatever.  Some people call it a problem.  Some people.  Yeah, some people call it a problem.  You might want to talk to Anthony.  Yeah, it's no big deal.  I've been up hours on end.  I've had my buddy Keith the cop has to sit in the seat next to me and hold a pillow. 
[03:08:00]  Watch the front.  His friend is Keith the flop.  It continues.  Oh, fuck you.  It just fucking continues.  I go pretty hard.  I think the worst thing with the casinos, man, you win big one time, you're scarred for  the rest of your casino life.  Because you just think it's a breeze.  Yeah, yep.  It's like, look at that.  I beat you, motherfucker.  You look for that same high every single time.  You ever drop more than 10?  What?  What?  10 is silly, right? 
[03:08:30]  I ever drop more than 10.  What?  Really?  What?  10 is fucking, can I get a marker for 10?  That's when you walk in the door.  I've had to cut the marker off.  I've had to take it off.  You see, no.  I was like, I don't want to.  I said, hey, the system, I don't want it no more.  Like, really, I took it out of there.  I took it out of there.  Just take it out of there.  I took it out of there.  I said, I'm tired.  Don't make it so easy.  I said, from now on, whatever I bring with me is what I'm going to lose.  That whole access, that's the worst shit in the world.  Paying them back is what hurts the most.  It really is the worst when you don't have that winning weekend.  And you're like, oh, that's just gone money now. 
[03:09:00]  You get back home.  So, guys, real quick.  What did I owe you?  Yeah.  Just double checking.  It's not that I don't have it.  Right.  Here's the worst.  Here's the worst, though.  Without the marker.  And you brought your own money, and that's all you're playing with.  But at the end of the night, this phone call's going on.  Look, I've had fucking American Express for 12 years.  If I can't get some kind of fucking cash in, man, why?  Why?  I don't have it, but I didn't sign up for a PIN number.  I'm not waiting two weeks for it.  I'm here now.  I'm here now. 
[03:09:30]  The table's hot, you fuck.  12 fucking years I've been there.  Look at my bill.  Every month it's paid in, motherfucker.  I've been there.  That's the fucking call.  I've been there.  I was in the Bahamas making that very call.  At the cage.  At the cage.  At the cage.  Did you swipe your card over there?  Yeah, I fucking swiped my card.  For some reason, they're telling me that you're not approving it.  What's going on?  I've been there.  It's not my problem.  This thing is good.  I've been there.  Oh, yeah.  My life has dropped more than 10, huh? 
[03:10:00]  What?  Yeah, it's not fun.  Dude, that's why.  Listen, I've taken my tiles where.  I'll put it this way.  I've lost the amounts that have made me think about life.  I was like, ah.  When you start going through shit you could have bought.  When you start thinking about the checks you got coming up.  Well, I got it.  Okay.  I'll go there next week, so I should be.  It's actually not really that much in the scheme of things.  I didn't lose it really if you think about it.  I just canceled the show.  I could earn it in an hour.  Danny.  Danny, it's Anthony.  It's 11.59. 
[03:10:30]  I need an ATM right now so I could get another.  I could get more cash at 12.01.  I need it now.  The double dip on the ATM.  We're like, you can't get another withdrawal for a week.  No.  I'm being serious.  I've been there.  I've definitely had to curve my casino appetite, dude.  I've gone back to the room just like, there have been a lot of times where I've miraculously,  like you, I never walk in there and start winning. 
[03:11:00]  I am always in the ditch trying to dig my way out.  And a lot of times I'll do pretty good.  And Keith is there grabbing stacks of chips going, I'm going to the cage.  Fuck you.  I'm going to the cage.  Fuck you.  And I'll start building up and feel good.  And then it's time to like, you look and go, okay, I'm comfortable going back to the  room.  Cash out.  You're feeling good.  You're up.  You feel good.  It's been in the morning.  Yeah.  You go right back.  I'm going to fuck him up some more.  And the worst thing though is not being able to come back.  And then you got to actually just give up and go like, go back to the room going, I lost. 
[03:11:30]  I'm fucking lost.  You had a conversation with yourself.  I'm going to give you the funniest gambling story before y'all go.  All right.  Michael Jordan, Antoine Walker.  Like right now, you know, Antoine Walker is over in like the D League and stuff like that.  Friend of mine.  Love Antoine to death.  Right.  So Michael Jordan is, you know, a notorious, like they know Mike Gamble.  You hung out with Michael Jordan.  I'm with Jordan now.  I'm with, I'm signed to Jordan.  I'm on a Jordan campaign.  Go look at the commercial.  Huh?  Oh, for the commercial?  We got, we're doing a campaign.  God damn your fame.  I didn't even realize until just now. 
[03:12:00]  I didn't need it, but I like hearing, I like hearing all this stuff.  Oh, what a good flash fire would do.  Oh, we can give you another Bob Kelly story.  He's got a Jordan story.  So what happened with that?  Sorry.  We can talk about how Bob's fat feet stretch out a pair of Air Jordans.  Holy shit, man.  So Jordan is like, you know, Jordan's real deal when it comes to gambling.  So Antoine's trying to hang with Jordan, you know, and gamble with Jordan, right?  So they're at the table, right?  You know, and Jordan's line is, don't worry, the cards will change. 
[03:12:30]  Like, eventually.  Listen, like, they're both getting buried.  Just got to keep your ass in the seat long enough.  That's Jordan's line.  Like, keep in mind, you know, the cards can change for Jordan.  His money can last forever.  Like, you know, eventually they're going to change.  So, dude, we're talking about some money.  I'm not going to describe, I'm not going to say, you know, some money.  So, like, the cards are not changing, right?  So Antoine's money is getting lower and lower, right?  So they start changing for Jordan. 
[03:13:00]  Jordan starts to get his money back.  It's the same shit.  And he's just got the crappy cards coming up.  Antoine's like, I'm done.  That's all I got.  He's like, ah, I thought you had more.  They'll change if you can get more.  So he's like, Jordan, you think you can give me?  No, I don't do that.  I don't do that.  He just had to leave.  He said no.  Oh, you had to get up and walk away.  Ooh, that hurts.  Because, you know, it's a lot of money.  Like, they were playing, like, for some money.  He wanted to hang out with Jordan and play with him. 
[03:13:30]  But Jordan, you know, to play on that level is a different ball game, man.  It's a funny, like, Jordan, every story I've heard about Jordan, you know, at a blackjack  table is legendary.  I don't doubt it, man.  One of them, they said, Damon Wayne saw him gambling, like, you know, a bunch of chips,  whatever.  So Jordan's, like, talking.  He's looking behind him.  He's not even really looking at the table, you know.  And Damon's, like, man, you're not even going to look at the table, man.  So Jordan was, like, if you got to pay attention, you shouldn't be gambling. 
[03:14:00]  Like, when you hear that, you go, whoa, he's right.  That guy's, like, got words of wisdom that only a true gambling.  Can you keep in mind, like, I've never not looked at the table.  I said, I don't need to be here.  I need to take my black ass upstairs to my room and put this money back where you're  looking at the cards as they're coming out.  I said, I've never been more focused on this than the rest of my life.  But that gambling will ruin your fucking life, man.  I honestly had to tell myself, like, I'm not a professional gambler. 
[03:14:30]  I'm trying to be a comedian and entertainer.  This is not my world.  Kevin, get your ass up and don't go.  So I stayed away for a minute.  But I was bad.  I was real bad.  Yeah, it can get bad.  That's it right there.  That's a commercial right there.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  See that?  Here it goes.  Some hot tech shit right here.  Goddamn.  Wow.  That's action-packed shit. 
[03:15:00]  That's not good.  I do know we have a door.  I stayed there for this stuff.  All right.  We need this.  Now this, my friend.  It's going to be fun.  God damn.  Look at you.  You shot like four.  We're doing like four or five of those.  Shouts out to Brand Jordan and D-Wade for the campaign right now.  Doing big things.  And Miami Heat.  Doing real good right now.  Well, I had good news, too, because I got a callback for a Sonny D print ad.

So, as we're all closing up, as we're going to leave, a lot sadder than when we came in.  Between this and the Paul McCartney show last night.  K-Hart online.  And K-Hart is spelled just H-A-R-T.  Yes, sir.  And Kevin's Twitter is Kevin Hart for number four real.  Kevin Hart for real.

And think Borgata, January 15th.  Yes.  I think that's it.  Kevin, what a pleasure, man.  Hey, man, thank you.  Yeah, absolutely.  I've been a fan of the show for a long time.  I'm glad I can find him to come back.  What a blast.  You'll never be back here.  No, I am.  No, Kevin will come back.  If he came back today, he'll come back.  Because if he came today, he'll come back.  I promise you I will.  I promise you I'll be back, man.
