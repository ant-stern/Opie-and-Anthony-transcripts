<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course into crude humor and offensive jokes. The show began with Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, boasting about their new morning show slots in Chicago and San Francisco, mocking their own perceived shortcomings ("dopes," "retards," "corn balls") while gleefully anticipating surpassing the low ratings of their predecessor, Rover.  They satirized their competition, Eric and Kathy, contrasting their bland image with their own outrageous style.  The hosts played audio from supportive and critical listener calls, highlighting one particularly enthusiastic endorsement for promotional use. They also discussed a San Francisco newspaper article acknowledging their controversial past while wishing them luck.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to mercilessly mocking Whoopi Goldberg's new radio show, "Wake up with Whoopi."  Audio clips of Whoopi discussing mundane topics like sunscreen and prostate cancer were played, with Opie and Anthony repeatedly mocking her delivery and perceived lack of comedic timing.  They contrasted her approach with their own, using it to criticize the perceived sanitization of modern radio. Listener calls ranged from enthusiastic support of the Whoopi mockery to outright hatred of the show itself.  One caller compared the Whoopi show to an addictive virus. The hosts engaged in numerous offensive jokes targeting Whoopi, race, and sunscreen.  A heated debate with a caller about animal welfare further escalated the show's offensive tone.  The hosts also discussed receiving Detroit Tigers jerseys, consulting a caller to ensure they wouldn’t attract gang violence by wearing them (the conclusion was they were safe).  Throughout this section,  the show promoted their upcoming Boston live show with Bill Burr.

The show continued with a discussion of a book review and a TV show about self-mutilation, which segued into vulgar jokes about a female writer.  A phone call with Chicago radio legend Steve Dahl followed, touching on a newspaper photo, Dahl's past alcohol abuse, and the challenges of expanding their show to new markets. The conversation included more offensive jokes and anecdotes, many involving Jim Norton’s drinking habits.  Calls from Richard (St. Louis) followed, alongside plugs for Bill Burr's show and a discussion of the Orient Point-Hamptons ferry.  The hosts interspersed this section with celebrity impersonations (Frank Vincent, Travis Tritt, Tommy Chong) and promoted their upcoming Worcester show, acknowledging their poor ratings in some markets (including 0.0 ratings).  Opie’s acid reflux and an upcoming appearance by Anthony’s brother Joe’s U2 tribute band on WB11 were also mentioned.

A segment featuring Sam, an employee whose afro was mocked, followed. A comedically bad "news report" from six months in the future was played, causing technical difficulties between XM and FM broadcasts. This was followed by a replay of the "Tourette's Whorehouse" bit. The show then tackled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, sparked by a listener letter, leading to a heated and offensive discussion. Bill Burr contributed to the chaotic, offensive atmosphere, referencing a previous broadcast issue.  The segment concluded with a song about fire engines ("The Little Boy Who Cried Fire"), with the hosts riffing on the lyrics.

The broadcast's penultimate segment began with a discussion of childhood lessons about fire, referencing an email from Opie's childhood friend Jerry. The conversation transitioned to Mel Gibson's DUI arrest and anti-Semitic remarks, with jokes about his blood alcohol content and Britney Spears' baby being in the car.  Opie's brother Joe's experiences with his U2 tribute band were discussed, detailing a chaotic gig with a heavily intoxicated and belligerent drummer. Audio of the incident wasn’t played. Dr. Charles Kimmelman, an otolaryngologist, then called in to discuss sleep apnea, resulting in a lengthy, often inappropriate discussion filled with jokes, tangents, and off-color questions regarding the causes, symptoms, treatments, and effects of sleep apnea, including a discussion of oral sex while a partner snores.  A recording of an extremely loud snore was played. Calls from listeners with sleep-related issues and one caller who was born without a sense of smell were featured, concluding abruptly after a discussion of a man caught masturbating in a library.


The final segment started with a news report about a man arrested for inappropriate activities in a children's library, prompting more jokes about masturbation. The hosts attempted to contact “Brother Joe,” whose U2 tribute band ("2U") was featured on a local news segment promoting a tribute band contest. A caller recounted ripping a nude photo from a library book for masturbation. The bulk of the segment focused on Brother Joe's band's struggles with its consistently drunk and disruptive drummer, who was fired repeatedly and ultimately sabotaged a Harrah's performance.  Brother Joe detailed the drummer's behavior, the replacement, and ongoing lineup issues, urging listeners to vote for his band on WB11.com.  The conversation shifted to an annoying corporate email with rearranged words producing humorous/offensive phrases, including "dirty room" and "woman Hitler." The show concluded with mentions of a Massachusetts governor's apology for using a racially charged phrase, an OzFest ticket giveaway, and a bizarre, impromptu comedic skit.  Beyond the hosts, Lou the Trucker was the only other character explicitly mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Smile, despicable human beings in the country. Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Enough of this saliva.  Are we ready to broadcast?  Of course. 
[00:01:30]  And that's how we start in Chicago.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And today it spreads to Chicago and San Francisco.  Hello.  Being heard on WCKG.  Our second try at WCKG.  Yeah.  Our second try in Chicago.  You might remember us.  We were on at night. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  They threw us on at night a few years back.  But you didn't hear us all the time because sometimes the show is preempted.  Preempted for hockey.  Now I respect that.  I'm a big hockey fan.  I'm a huge hockey fan.  No, we were not preempted for the Chicago Blackhawks.  No.  No.  We were preempted for minor league hockey.  Yeah, minor league hockey.  Minor league hockey in a city that has the NHL.  We didn't feel too good about ourselves. 
[00:02:30]  No.  This time around, we get to do morning and we're not going to be preempted anytime soon.  Nope.  Hopefully.  All we have to do is move the needle and we'll be fine in Chicago.  Yeah, from what I'm reading, that needle's on empty.  That needle's on E.  Yeah, the bosses are pretty much telling us, you know, just give it a couple dollars worth of gas.  You guys will be fine.  That's it.  Give me five dollars regular. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, we just got an empty tank.  We just need you guys to fill it up just a little bit.  Just to get the thing moving.  Get to the next gas station.  That's all we need.  We're in the greatest position.  We have smiles on our faces because we can't lose.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  They're throwing us into virtual radio crack houses.  Yeah, for the rest of the country and our faithful listeners, you know, we're starting up in Chicago and we're taking over for Rover, who unfortunately did not fare too well in Chicago. 
[00:03:30]  And we like Rover.  He's a good guy.  And he kills in Cleveland.  In Cucamonga.  And he's doing quite well in a bunch of other cities.  But for whatever reason, Chicago just didn't embrace him.  No.  Didn't embrace him to the point that his ratings are barely, barely, what's the word I'm looking for?  A blip on the radar screen.  Barely a blip on the radar screen. 
[00:04:00]  So now we get to come in and even if we just do this for three hours, we're going to move the needle and look like heroes.  Let me tell you.  That's not much different than what we're going to be doing.  Yeah, exactly.  By the way.  And I'm not trying to be cocky.  Trust me.  Yeah.  We're heading into Chicago in a very good position right now.  It's just one of those awful situations in Chicago where the station really, really is just a shadow of its former self. 
[00:04:30]  Except for Steve Dahl.  Steve Dahl is still kicking ass.  Steve kicks ass.  And the other shows that they've put into place, they should do well also.  But the radio industry has you people in Chicago like pegged as some type of weirdos.  Like anytime we hear about the people in Chicago, it's like, hey, hey, it's a whole different thing there in Chicago.  They don't have the same listening habits as anywhere else in the country. 
[00:05:00]  They're like weird or strange or you always hear that speech from everybody.  They like their local guys or they like this guy or once they get something, they stick with it.  Well, I don't want to disagree with that because as I look at all the radio stations in Chicago and where we're going to get all our listeners, we have to get a lot of listeners from Eric and Kathy.  Is that, oh, brother.  Yeah, but you don't want to go up against them head to head. 
[00:05:30]  They are tough.  Yeah.  They are tough.  Banging heads with the likes of Eric and Kathy.  They're a Chicago staple.  So watch out, guys.  Yeah.  So, yeah, because we like to see what the, you know, what our competition is and what the other morning shows are doing.  Well, we have to take on Eric and Kathy.  We have an Eric here and we have a Kathy, but he goes by the name of Travis.  His little girl body.  Didn't we already beat up Eric and Kathy because it was fun? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, because it was fun.  One day out of nowhere, somebody just called up from Chicago and said, we have this awful show here in Chicago.  So he put his phone by his speaker and we were able to listen to Eric and Kathy and they were doing like some really bad, hacky, typical radio bit.  Wait, weren't they on Good Morning America or something?  Yeah.  Isn't that when we saw them?  They were on this show.  Yeah.  Being interviewed in a show.  Doing something about they're not married, but like they act like it.  They act like it at the.  At the workplace, at the workplace, but they can only go so far because they do have, you know, at least one of them has a actual spouse. 
[00:06:30]  And that could get a little dicey once you get home and tell the wife, you know, hey, so what?  It was a bit that we, you know, she went under the console and Eric and Kathy, that's the competition.  Yeah, we had fun with them and no one in Chicago got to hear it.  So except for the people that listen to us on XM. 
[00:07:00]  No.  So we're very excited.  Chicago, man, I hope you at least give the radio show a shot.  Yeah.  I hope you give it a shot at least.  Oh, we'll run through what we do every new market.  We know.  We've seen it.  The you suck calls.  Get off.  We hate you.  Well, let's take two phone calls from Chicago.  Let's see.  Let's see what we get right out of the right out of the gates here.  Darren in Chicago.  What's up?  How are you doing this morning?  First of all, welcome to Chicago.  Second of all, Eric and Kathy suck ass. 
[00:07:30]  Well, you know, you're going to have to take them seriously.  They've got a lot of listeners.  They're a juggernaut.  They're a juggernaut.  No, I've been in Chicago all my life for 32 years, and Eric and Kathy, they just suck.  Yeah.  Now that Kyle's gone, he's going to AM radio from what I heard last night.  And, you know, Kyle's gone.  Eric and Kathy's the only thing left.  There's no other major radio station in Chicago in the morning. 
[00:08:00]  Well, we welcome the ManCal listeners, and hopefully you'll like what we're doing.  Well, if you can get a couple billboards up there, you guys should probably have a lot of listeners.  All right, Darren.  Thank you so much.  Not a problem.  I've already spread the word in the last few days.  When I found out a couple days ago, you guys are coming out here to Chicago.  I've already talked to a lot of people who don't have XM.  Cool.  That's why we call it, like, the O&A virus.  Your job, if you like what you're hearing, you kind of spread it to your friends and family and stuff for us, your coworkers.  I'll tell you, when I first got XM, because I'm a truck driver, I listened to you from time to time. 
[00:08:30]  Of course he is.  He's still babbling.  Don't explain these.  The truckers never shut up.  We love the truckers, but they never know when you're trying to wrap it up.  Like, when you're like, hey, thanks for calling.  No, you're welcome, because I remember the first time.  All right.  Right.  That's why they choke so many hookers.  The hookers are just trying to leave, get away from that conversation.  Listen to me, bitch.  They don't even want to kill you.  They just want a body to talk to.  They're like sitting in the back.  Upside down in the seat.  Just rotting in the back, in that little camper in the back. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, yeah, let me tell you about the time I was hauling doorknobs.  Really?  Yeah, he doesn't want us to hang up.  He's got 500 miles to go.  You can't hang up.  All right, Darren, we got to let you go.  I'm sorry.  All right, no, no, big deal.  Go get on the CB and talk to somebody.  Keeper between the ditches.  All right, let's say hi to Joe in Chicago.  Joe, what's up?  What's cracking, boys?  Hey, what's up?  I'd like to welcome you out to Chicago also, and you have nothing to worry about with Kathy  and Eric.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  And if the people that are listening to this station do not like this show, kill yourselves.  Nobody cares.  All right.  That was a good thing.  I hope we got that.  We can isolate that for a promo.  That's a rousing endorsement.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Jason in Chicago, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say welcome back and happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you for your birthday.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  All right.  Punch it out.  Appreciate it.  Oh, so far, so good, and we haven't even done anything yet.  So there you go.  We're on WCKG in Chicago. 
[00:10:00]  Also, we have to say hi to San Francisco today.  Yep.  KIFR, Free FM in San Francisco, we're now on there as well.  And let's see.  The newspaper are already talking about the radio show.  Opie and Anthony start in San Francisco Tuesday.  Local CBS broadcasting affiliate KIFR will move Opie and Anthony into the 10 a.m.  to 1 p.m. slot starting Tuesday.  That is today.  And then, of course, this reporter has to get right into it. 
[00:10:30]  These were the guys who ended up in trouble for broadcasting a report based on a couple having sex in a church,  the kind of thing the FCC loves to police to show that its members deserve their big salaries.  Oh, boy.  The current administration has upped fines for indecency to $325,000 in an effort to show that while it can't find Osama bin Laden or even police the airwaves in Spanish,  it can save years from anything rude or slightly funny. 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  So actually, he's on our side.  Okay.  I kind of agree with that.  Maybe I should have read this before he went on the air.  You kind of read it with that angry, meh, boo.  You know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because we're used to, like, getting trashed in the papers.  So I went on the defensive.  We do.  And then I'm in the middle of reading that going, uh-oh, this is actually not that bad.  We do bias things.  We slant things just by the way we read them.  Right.  Normally, something could be like, you know, I guess here's Eric and Kathy.  We got their bios. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  So you could read, you know, Eric Ferguson.  Eric, morning show host, grew up in a small town called Elburn, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Iowa.  Right, right, right.  All right, or you could go, Eric, the morning show host, grew up in a small town called Elburn, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Iowa.  It's all how you read it.  Well, I was on-  And you were doing the, this guy's a jackass read.  Well, because they mentioned the Sex with Sam thing, and I'm like, oh, here we go again. 
[00:12:00]  But no, he actually, you know, spun it a little bit.  Yeah.  Way to go, Brad.  Thank you, Brad.  Thanks, Brad.  And then it continues, it's really a terrible time to be a broadcaster on commercial airways of anything but elevator music.  So good luck, guys.  The guy's even wishing us good luck in his article.  I didn't even know it.  I'm ready to trash him.  Good luck.  And then he writes, and he bets on when they get their first find.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, that's a little dig.  So there you have it.  K-I-F-R, Free FM in San Francisco. 
[00:12:30]  We say hi to you as well today.  And we don't like to talk about the competition and give them ratings.  But I was reading these Eric and Kathy bios.  Yeah, let's get it.  Aren't they great?  We're in trouble.  Yeah.  Just some little good-natured laughs.  Yeah, they have little bios, I guess, on their website, and there's things that they like, what they hate.  It was kind of a bummer because we were talking to the Chicago people yesterday, you know, getting ready for the big move to do mornings in Chicago.  And we're like, all right, where are we going to get our listeners from, you know? 
[00:13:00]  The old days, it's like, you know, you have to take on Mancow or Howard, you know?  So we're getting ready.  And they're like, well, Jonathan Brandmeier.  But he's still doing the same old, same old.  So that'll be way too easy to get listeners from him.  Yeah.  He's just lazy and old and doing the same crap he's done for many, many years.  And then they go, tell you the truth, I think you'll get most of your listeners from Eric and Kathy.  I'm like, ugh. 
[00:13:30]  So welcome, fat housewives that were enjoying that drivel.  Eric and Kathy, we want to have some fun.  Eric looks like a Nazi.  That's stupid, perfect.  He certainly has a nice Aryan look to him, doesn't he?  He does.  So what do you like about the bios there, Jimmy?  Well, I mean, just, I hope I can get through this without laughing.  But they tell a little bit about where he went to school.  And then the jokes start.  Like, they list some things.  Hilarity.  Yeah, if you don't laugh at this, well, then you just shouldn't be listening to comedy radio. 
[00:14:00]  He says, monogamy is best on a dining room table.  Oh, wait.  I thought you said mahogany.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  And then there's Saturdays and Sundays, and the line is, are for sleeping in, but until 6 a.m.  Oh, the inspiration one is just terrific. 
[00:14:30]  Jesus, you're kidding me.  Inspiration, then it goes dot, dot, dot, is Fonzie's favorite point.  Get it?  Inspiration point.  Where he used to take the chicks and do nothing.  Yes, exactly.  He just put his thumbs up.  Hey.  What has he got under Bad Dreams, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Oh!  Bad Dreams dot, dot, dot.  Usually makes good radio. 
[00:15:00]  Does it?  Oh, he's just horrid.  And then Kathy's is always...  This milk toast.  Is this what this show is about?  Yes, she is perfect.  It's just milk toast.  This is what the FCC has done.  And this is the point I'm getting at when we were asking about the competition yesterday  when we were talking to the bigwigs in Chicago.  And when they told me Eric and Kathy, I thought they were kidding.  I thought they were kidding.  And then I realized the FCC has cut off everyone's you-know-what. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That this is what's left.  But we're here to say that we could still do edgy, compelling, funny radio.  Radio eunuchs.  Just bring me more grapes, eunuch.  The FCC wants stations like a mix station or a light FM to be successful.  You know, we're going to prove that you can still do the edgy stuff and get an audience.  It's a feel-good show.  Kathy has her black belt.  And karate, for real.  Does she?  Yeah.  Does she? 
[00:16:00]  I got a gun.  Our club star, Kenny, is also a black belt.  I'd love to watch him drive his knee into her throat.  We're up for the challenge.  Give her a good throat knee, Ken.  She has some funny ones, too, though.  They're like, you know, points to which it says work.  Love to hear it.  And then dot, dot, dot.  Should never feel like work.  I don't know what that means.  It's not funny or interesting or even a complete statement.  Wait, work?  Dot, dot, dot.  Should never feel like work.  Never.  Oh, she means if you're, like, your job should kind of feel like something fun you're doing. 
[00:16:30]  Something fun.  And so, you know, if you're up on a hot roof today spreading tar on a roof and it's 110 degrees,  dude, Kathy's telling you that shouldn't feel like work.  You should be enjoying yourself.  What does she more mean than when you're a hole who destroys anything that resembles humor on the radio,  that shouldn't feel like work?  Yeah, Kathy, way to know your...  Oh, gosh.  Stop it, Jimmy.  Cut it out, guys.  Oh, guys, now.  If I wasn't here, you wouldn't know where the line was.  I keep you guys in check. 
[00:17:00]  Do ya?  Kathy, way to know your audience.  Most of them are blue-collar people trying to eke out a living.  Yeah.  I hate...  And let this one just sit there because the laughs...  Because I'm seeing it another way, and it's actually very funny in my head.  Just say it and let it just sit there.  Night on a dog, Alice.  Night on a dog.  I heard him, Ralph.  Read it.  You have no sense of humor.  I hate...  Hold on.  Read it.  Let it sit there so the listeners can enjoy it because it's actually really funny if you use your imagination. 
[00:17:30]  Thank you.  Okay, go ahead.  I hate...  Dot, dot, dot.  The smell of peas.  Let that simmer.  Let it slow boil.  Which is...  That's weird because Jimmy loves it.  I was just going to say, Jimmy loves the smell of peas.  I do.  Yeah.  That's why they call me old popcorn, brother.  You're the exact opposite of Kathy. 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  Mm-mm.  Wow.  Peas.  P-E-A-S.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Where are you going?  As a mother, dot, dot, dot, I've become completely addicted to my children's love.  That's a lovely statement, but how can that be funny while you're driving to work?  She's a panic, this one.  She's addicted to her kids' love.  Addicted to her kids' love.  There's a rehab for that.  It's run by Yates.  Exactly.  You want to break that addiction? 
[00:18:30]  Fill the tub with water.  Or back them into a ditch in the minivan to a little lake.  Stupid.  People were excited.  Black belt mom who's addicted to love, put on your laughing hats.  Yeah, because that's just terrific when radio hosts talk about their wives, their spouses, or their children.  She could drive the kids to soccer practice and kick a little ass on the way.  Ooh.  I like her.  I'll bet they reference her karate skills on the show, too.  All the truth. 
[00:19:00]  I don't want to go.  Oh, she's mad.  Watch it.  Hey, she's got a black belt.  She might chop this segment up and try to find something funny in it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Just smash both their faces.  What else?  What else?  What else?  Oh, the greatest attribute in a man is big hands.  Why is that?  Is it?  Because they say big hands.  Oh, I bet you she likes black hands.  No, she's a...  No.  Black hands with pink fingertips.  Dude, that's her attempt at being edgy.  She's a size queen.  Exactly.  A size queen.  A size queen. 
[00:19:30]  Kathy's a size queen, everybody.  She heard that Shaq had been 22 feet, and she just salivated with big black feet.  Like big hands, do you?  Dirty suburban whore.  That's why I hate the Asians.  They have tiny fingers.  Oh, it's going to be fun.  Good morning, Chicago.  I bet she's just giving spinning back kicks to anything funny that pops out of anyone's mouth.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Knocking it out.  Knocking the humor out.  As that punchline shows up, you just hear, hyah!  And they go to break.  And they count, one, two, you're out.  Big hands.  Big hands.  We're wonderful.  Let's go to Rob on the south side.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, welcome to Chicago, boys.  There's one more morning show you got to worry about.  Yeah.  It's Drex in the Morning.  It's like this morning zoo, Hornhark and Gabberfest.  Oh.  What's it called?  Yeah, Drex in the Morning. 
[00:20:30]  D-R-E-X?  Okay.  Yeah, it's like, you know, Stuntman Galore.  You know, I'm on top of the Sears Tower.  I'm about to, you know.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What year is this?  Awful.  Yeah.  But you guys suck.  Thank you, my friend.  We're the edgy hosts.  Is there anybody doing anything just kind of like adult conversations and having some fun?  We're sick in the head.  We actually enjoy when another edgy host even takes shots at us.  Yeah, it's fun to listen to. 
[00:21:00]  It motivates us.  It motivates the O&A Pest.  We got to take on an Eric and Kathy morning show that's on a station called Mix.  What happened to the radio world?  Eric looks like he could be the head of the Mel Gibson fan club.  He really is.  He really is an Aryan looking guy.  All right.  Love to see him in a pith helmet.  Yeah.  I'm sure we love to see that, too.  Drive his head right into Kathy.  Or he probably just gets nude, puts on a pith helmet, sits in a sidecar, and watches  the Lethal Weapon trilogy. 
[00:21:30]  Do you?  Stupid Eric Nazi face.  Stinks.  Stupid Eric Nazi face.  Unfunny.  All right.  Let's say hi to Greg in Canada.  Greg, what's up?  We know how it goes.  Yeah, Greg.  Jimmy, how are you?  I'm okay, Eric.  Thanks for asking.  I didn't know Jimmy had his own show.  Yeah?  Oh, no.  I heard that he was in Nashville, and I heard that it went really good for him, but I was  wondering if he was going to be coming up to Canada soon.  Eventually, I'll get up to Canada, man. 
[00:22:00]  I just wanted to figure out where to go in Canada, where I'll draw the most people slash  women.  Well, there was a Montreal comedy tour or something that you were supposed to be going to, wasn't  there?  Oh, I was chastising you.  No, there was a comedy festival in Montreal.  Yeah, Montreal comedy festival.  Montreal, as they said.  That passed.  Yeah, we couldn't do it, sir.  Anyways, I'm just kidding, guys.  Love your show.  When were you?  Anthony and Openy.  Great job you're doing up here in Canada.  Anthony and Openy.  Thank you, Greg.  Appreciate that.  All right, why don't we take our first break? 
[00:22:30]  Greg just wrecked.  Wrecked by a moose.  Yeah, Greg just wrecked the flow of the show.  Thanks, Greg and Canada.  We appreciate it.  All right, a couple things.  We've got to take a break, but when we get back, we need a homie from New York to call  that knows the whole gang mentality.  Uh-huh.  Because we've got a present from Detroit, and I want to make sure it's okay to wear it.  Safe for us to walk around in.  So I need a homie that knows all about the gang culture.  I think clubs are kidding. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think.  Well, we'll explain after the break.  And what was the other thing?  Oh!  Whoopi Goldberg started doing radio here in New York yesterday.  Wake up with Whoopi is what they're pushing.  And we'll get into it next, but it got really interesting after our show yesterday.  And the Daily News here in New York wanted to talk about Whoopi's first day on the radio.  And they wanted to do a nice feel-good piece about Whoopi's first day.  And right smack in the middle of the article, and you know how they make one of the quotes  really big in an article? 
[00:23:30]  Bold print and put it in a box?  Yeah, push it out.  It's Whoopi commenting about Anthony and I and Jim Norton.  We just wrecked her first day, and the Daily News picked up on it.  And a wonderful, blunt comment from Whoopi.  Oh, it's great.  And the ONA pest, you got some more ink here in New York today, so congratulations on that.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll get into that and some other things in just a bit.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[00:24:00]  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Fast.  We're angry.  I'm scared.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America, and today it spreads to Chicago and San Francisco,  and we couldn't be happier. 
[00:24:30]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Sean in New York.  Sean, what's up?  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  It's the girly version of Sean.  We like when that happens.  I'm surprised.  It is a surprise, because usually, like, guys will call, and, like, their name will be Terry  or something.  They'll be like, and we'll take the call, because it's a girl, and go, hey, Terry. 
[00:25:00]  And then, hi, how you doing?  Ah, you're not Terry.  Out of here.  You're a guy, and now we pick up Sean, thinking it's going to be a guy, and it's a girl.  Surprise.  It's a very nice surprise.  Yeah, I just want to say I love you guys.  Love, love, love you.  And I was listening to you yesterday talk about Whoopi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very disappointing.  And I didn't really believe you until I had to hear it for myself.  And during your commercial break about 20 minutes ago, I went and I listened, and you would not 
[00:25:30]  believe what is going on on that station.  What are they doing today?  She was listing, I kid you not, the ingredients in sunscreen.  Now, what are we going to do in the 8 o'clock hour today?  Because that's what we were going to do.  Oh, damn.  I don't know.  She trumped you guys on that one.  What the hell is she doing that for? 
[00:26:00]  And why?  Shouldn't she have thought of that 42 years ago?  A little late for sunscreen.  The guy she's with is like totally going along with it.  Poor Cubby.  God, what, is she going to spend the whole morning talking about things she doesn't need  to use?  Exactly.  She's like sodium benzoite.  Ah, that's wonderful.  Well, stupid Whoopi Goldberg, stupid clear channel.  And this is for you, Chicago, as well, because this dumb show is coming your way, and we're  not scared of it.  We'll promote the hell out of it.  I don't care.  Whoopi Goldberg has decided that the way to get into radio is to do a friendly, nice, 
[00:26:30]  kind of like a Rosie O'Donnell thing.  When Rosie O'Donnell first started doing TV, it's all about being nice.  Before she's backed up, yeah.  And talking about manners, and we're not going to do any shocking stuff.  Like, the Mel Gibson story is huge.  Everybody's talking about it.  She wouldn't, no.  She would not touch it because, hey.  Because yesterday was manners Monday, and I'm not kidding.  Well, where's the, uh.  I'd love to say that was a joke.  Right, right.  But she did, like, she said yesterday was going to be manners Monday. 
[00:27:00]  As far as Gibson, this tells you what the show's going to be about.  When Gibson's arrest came up, she said he made a mistake, and he's dealing with it,  and that's all I'm going to say about that.  People make mistakes.  That's it.  That's the way to do a radio show.  Don't address one of the biggest stories of the day.  Speaking of making mistakes, why did they hire her?  And today she's talking about the ingredients and sunscreen.  Well, good luck to you there, Whoopi.  You know who tried the same thing?  I'm sorry, Sean.  Radio took such a downside turn, you guys. 
[00:27:30]  You know what?  And it's so nice to have you guys back, let me tell you.  Thanks a lot, Sean.  It's good to hear that.  Oh, yes.  It was almost nice talking to you.  Yes, you should hang up, because this is about to get uncomfortable for all of us.  You're being nice, please.  Fighting the urge to be vicious.  Niceness stinks.  It really does.  All right.  Overrated.  Bye, Sean.  You know who tried that once?  Uh-huh.  Marie Osmond.  There's another one.  She comes out of nowhere and thinks she's going to do a radio show, and they pushed it  as this whole nice thing. 
[00:28:00]  She's just going to be nice.  She got syndicated to a bunch of markets, and it failed miserably.  It's basic human nature to be vicious.  We like things.  Even if you're a nice person at heart and you treat people nicely, when you watch the  news, you don't want your life to be boring.  Life is, in general, pretty boring, especially if you're nice.  So you like to be entertained by things that are a little more vicious.  The news knows this.  That's why they show dead people and bombings all the time. 
[00:28:30]  It gives you a little thrill when the terrorism alert goes up.  You might not like it.  You don't want to see it, but it's like, oh, wait, what happened?  Did you hear?  People like to gossip.  Hey, did you hear?  And that's what it's all about.  So the nice thing just doesn't work.  I think they explained it in The Matrix.  They made a perfect society where people didn't have to work.  And people were dropping dead.  They need life.  You need a little bit of crap thrown in there.  Yeah.  Just be honest. 
[00:29:00]  Stop trying to force niceness out of everybody's throat.  Stop trying to be chipper in the morning.  Yeah.  Teary.  You're a breath of fresh air on the way to work.  Nobody wants that, stupid.  No.  No.  There's always that smell when you go into the subway.  Absolutely.  And that ain't a breath of fresh air.  That's a homeless guy who drank too much.  You know what this show is?  It's the gunk you find under your shoe where you curse the neighbor's dog.  That's what's bleeding out of your radio.  And it's very easy, too.  Like, let's say you're driving to work and there's a massive traffic jam.  What do you want to see?  Do you want to see some housewife changing a tire on her minivan? 
[00:29:30]  Or do you want to see a horrific accident by the time you get to the clog?  Well, that's why they rubberneck.  Exactly.  Because they want to see the wreck.  What I want to see is Whoopi naked in the shoulder applying sunscreen.  Reading the ingredients.  Yeah.  Hey, uh.  She doesn't need.  Yeah, she's going to be talking about a comb the next hour.  Yeah, flying standby.  He writes, hey, Ope, Whoopi's talking about things she doesn't use.  So the next hour is about job applications and humor. 
[00:30:00]  Screwed up his life.  Whoopi was a funny comic, too.  Like, there was a time I really loved Whoopi Goldbrains.  I'm not going to say she sucked because she was a good stand-up.  I just, I don't know when I stopped liking her.  I never really liked her act.  Like, she did that one-woman show thing, and that's kind of where she came from.  That's, like, got her popularity.  And it was just, like, those one-woman show things are so hack.  Well.  Oh, look, she's doing a valley girl, and she's black.  I get it. 
[00:30:30]  Well, this is what happened yesterday.  So she starred on the radio here in New York, and we have ONA PES.  Most people know that now.  Actually, the media is starting to really pick up on the fact that we have PES.  There are shows out there that try the Army thing, and you sign up online, and you get a number.  You'll get a sticker or a patch or some dog tags.  But you're in the station's Army.  But you actually never do anything for that show?  No, because it's forced on you.  But it just sounds cool?  There's not a natural passion for what you're listening to. 
[00:31:00]  So it's kind of a forced thing, usually tied into some kind of contest.  You know, you get into a club for half price if you're wearing their dog tag of the Army or something lame like that.  But we have ONA PES.  It's a lot different.  Or just the opposite of the Army whole thing, whereas we give you nothing, and you do all the footwork.  Right.  You do all the work.  In return, you get nothing.  Although, you do get a little link in the big city papers.  That's right.  And it's a way of protecting the Opie and Anthony show, by the way, because we learned years ago that any stupid organization with a letterhead could get you kicked off the radio. 
[00:31:30]  So we decided to fight back by developing this whole ONA pest mentality where we attack back.  And we didn't even do it.  They took it upon themselves, really.  We named them pests because there was no word that described them better.  They just pester you.  It's like when you're trying to sleep in a hot room on a summer night and a mosquito that you can't kill just right in your ear all night long. 
[00:32:00]  That's what our fans are like.  They're just horrid.  The corner of the mouth, cold sores.  Yeah.  They're a collection of breathing, walking cold sores, and you can't stop opening your mouth.  Ow.  Ow.  They're a little zit right in your nostril.  Just the pain that you can't quite get at.  Oh, that's by, you know why that happens?  Why is that?  When you pull out the long ones.  No.  Maybe when you pull out the long ones.  No, when I pull out the long ones.  I use a tissue and I cannot look at the body product. 
[00:32:30]  No, I'm not talking, I'm talking about the hair.  Oh, a hair?  I mean, I try to keep it all trim and stuff, but every once in a while you'll be feeling around and you go, oh, that's a little long.  And you pluck it out and that's what causes the pimples inside the dog.  You get an ingrown hair.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So anyway, yesterday it was Whoopi.  Thanks for that helpful hint.  Well, you know, we try to teach things here on the show, too.  So yesterday was Whoopi's first day in New York.  I know.  And the pest decided to welcome her to New York Opie and Anthony style. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, pest style.  And they had no clue we were coming at them yesterday, so they were putting all our O&A pests on the air and Whoopi was getting all pissed off and stuff.  Yeah.  And we had a lot of fun.  So now the New York Daily News wanted to do a little story on her first day.  And we're all over the article.  Whoopi.  I'll just read some of the good parts here.  Whoopi for civility on her first day.  Civility.  Being civil.  That's so nice of her.  Should we give the update before I read the article or after about the phone calls that happened after the show yesterday? 
[00:33:30]  Whatever you want to do.  I don't know.  Well, the O&A pest got to Whoopi and Cubby and Clear Channel so bad that all the big execs at Clear Channel calling our bosses trying to get us in trouble.  Ew.  For what?  Yep.  Oh, it's illegal to be playing Whoopi audio on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I know.  It's illegal.  Because the toothpaste is crashing, burn.  And you know what?  Our lawyers did the right thing.  They fought for us.  And guess what?  It's not illegal. 
[00:34:00]  It's called acceptable usage.  And we'll continue to play her awful radio show on our program when it makes sense.  Yep.  You know?  When a pest gets through.  But remember yesterday, because we played a clip of her going, hey, you know, you guys aren't going to get to us.  We're just doing our thing here.  That was her first comment.  Right.  Or whatever it was.  I'm paraphrasing or whatever.  A few more calls in.  She cracked.  Yeah, I guess she did crack.  It didn't take long.  As soon as they were off the air, they had all sorts of meetings over there trying to make a stop already.  Yeah.  So the New York Daily News, good old David Hinckley on top of what's going on in radio in New York. 
[00:34:30]  The Post has just given up on radio in New York.  Every once in a while, they'll do a cute little article and get everything wrong.  David Hinckley writes, Whoopi Goldberg made it clear yesterday that her new morning radio show would rather promote thank you notes than poke into Mel Gibson's drunk driving arrest.  She actually was saying something about the fact that the thank you note is a thing of the past, Opie.  Yeah.  That people really aren't writing and mailing out thank you notes. 
[00:35:00]  What year do you live in?  Because we have text messaging and email, stupid.  Who wants to read a little post-it?  Oh, the yellow post-it with a thank you on it.  What, did she get a quill and write it in calligraphy?  Dear sir, thank you.  Oh, there's no, that's gone.  That type of stuff is really gone.  Maybe it is unfortunate, but it's just the way it is.  Now you email.  Thanks, ass.  Thanks, I'm Mel.  Huh?  Thanks.  Thanks for the happy ending. 
[00:35:30]  We got Whoopi talking about us today.  What happened?  What did we do?  Was she upset?  Look, man.  Barely touched her.  Keep it positive, Whoop.  Keep it positive.  Right.  You're not going to find a more honest show than the Opie and Anthony show, okay?  So whatever she's telling our listeners is complete BS.  I haven't even seen this yet.  Haven't heard anything about this yet.  I mean, I haven't heard this yet.  This is hot off the president.  All right.  So getting back into it.  So Whoopi Goldberg made it clear yesterday that her new morning radio show would rather  promote thank you notes than poke into Mel Gibson's drunk driving arrest.  Goldberg and her partner, longtime Z100 afternoon host Cubby Bryant, made nice at every turn during 
[00:36:00]  their first morning.  Tell me something good, Goldberg said to callers, who she praised for projects that range from  creating jewelry for adoptive parents to playing music at senior centers.  Holy Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  What did that last statement say, please?  The last sentence?  The last sentence?  Hold on.  Read back from the transcript.  I need a nice sound effect for this. 
[00:36:30]  Promote something positive.  I'm sure Pat Munaki might have a...  I got it.  I got it, Jimmy.  Uh, yeah, uh, tell me something good, Goldberg said to callers, who she praised for projects  that range from creating jewelry for adoptive parents to playing music at senior centers.  Oh.  Oh, shish.  A little too much sugar.  I think that was a little too sweet for him. 
[00:37:00]  You are finished in radio before you even begin.  You know what music you should play in senior centers?  Taps.  Watch them shuffle around in their white shoes while you play Taps, you dope.  The only music she should hear is the Muzak over the sound system getting lower and lower  as a male nurse puts a pillow over your face.  Exactly.  As you're asking Nurse Ratched to turn you down before the big Indian smothers you because  you've been lobotomized. 
[00:37:30]  Play some music for the seniors.  Shut your face.  That's what they should hear.  I'm hung.  Shut up, old person.  Old people can play along with the rhythm section with the Velcro on their diaper.  When you're on the Opium Anthony Show, we bully the elderly.  That's right.  Make that into a promo, Steve.  They're easy targets.  That's right.  We know.  Can't even run.  They can't hear you, but they respond to a fist. 
[00:38:00]  Well, you know it's easy to catch them, too, if they're using one of those walkers with  the wheels and the handbrakes on it.  You don't know the tension release you feel when you hit a real old person and they fall  backwards and their shoes are still right where they left them.  If you need handbrakes to stop a piece of aluminum that weighs three ounces, maybe it's time to  cash it in burden.  Exactly.  Go put the tennis balls on the front of it so it doesn't scrape up your floor. 
[00:38:30]  Don't you notice when company comes over, your family puts you in the little small bathroom  with the cat box and you sit there and you talk to those little coated treats?  Just sit there for an hour.  Right on, man.  Right on.  You sit on the tub irrelevant.  Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, back in the...  Yeah, we know.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The cat's even bored with you.  Continuing with the whoopee article from the New York Daily News today. 
[00:39:00]  Thank you notes came up as part of the Manor's Monday theme wherein Goldberg lamented the  erosion of civility.  Yeah.  We're going to save this woman, by the way, because as each day goes by, one of these days  she's just going to unload and drop the C-bomb on us and everything.  She's going to lose her mind.  She asked for callers' pet peeves about manners like not offering seats to pregnant women.  What?  Holy crap.  Why would you give some pregnant chick, she's one chick you know you can't bang, why be 
[00:39:30]  nice to her?  When Gibson's arrest came up, like I said, she said he made a mistake and he's dealing  with it and that's all I'm going to say about that.  People make mistakes.  Pest alert, pest alert, pest alert.  Offer a pregnant woman a seat on a boat in Modesto.  Here's where the pests get involved.  In the world of morning radio, often edgy and usually at least mildly suggestive, Whoopi 
[00:40:00]  sound like Opie and Anthony.  Whoa.  Speaking of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  The WFNY team encouraged their prank-minded listeners and then in quotations and parentheses,  pests.  Pests.  See, at least he knows the terminology.  To call Goldberg.  While Bryant dumped the calls, they spurred Goldberg's only flash of mild annoyance.  Howard Stern is my friend, she said. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  These others are not worth the dust he walks on.  Dust is a good word.  Opie and Anthony responded with glee.  Opie saying, go back to Hollywood, you bitch.  Nice quote to have in the paper.  You're angry.  You're an angry man.  Yeah, as you smile ear to ear.  Shut up.  Scerical.  And then it says, welcome to New York.  And then it continues with how nice her show is and how boring it is. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  I know.  I'm going to glance over Mel Gibson.  That's a big story.  You probably know him.  You've met him.  Well, that's the problem.  That's why she's not going to be able to do Honest Radio because you're going to have  to talk bad about your friends sometimes.  People make mistakes.  Well, there's a really original sentiment.  How old are you?  Four?  A mistake isn't something like Mel Gibson did.  That's an ideology.  That's like saying, you know, Hitler and the Nazis made a mistake.  Yeah.  You know, it's one of those things.  A mistake, driving drunk, could even be considered a mistake. 
[00:41:30]  That was a mistake.  You have a couple of beers.  You don't realize maybe you're over the limit.  You drive.  You blow into it.  You're over the limit.  No, I just realized.  Bill from Waterford.  Sorry to...  I got to back up slightly.  Yes, San Francisco.  Anthony mentioned a boat in Modesto.  Oh, well, I'm trying to keep it local for the people.  How far now?  And then he writes, get used to it.  Yeah.  See, we were getting away with...  Close enough.  We were getting away with murder before we headed San Francisco as one of our affiliates. 
[00:42:00]  He moved close to San Francisco after she disappeared for a while.  It's close enough.  All right.  So here's the latest on Whoopi.  This is from this morning.  Whoopi addresses ONA, the pests, and Howard.  Explains how she's making moves to deal with the rude callers, which is to say she isn't.  Here's the audio from today.  She tried to get our bosses to get us in trouble, and it's just not going to happen there, Whoopi.  Well, this involves us.  Let's give it a listen. 
[00:42:30]  I like it.  Because you know what?  Chin up, Whoop.  When it comes to radio, we're smarter than you.  On the other hand, there are shout-outs there from other people we're not even going to think about.  Don't even mention them.  Well, no.  You know, you have to mention that you know that they're there.  But, you know, I think they call me something ugly.  They call me some kind of weird word.  Are you going to do something about it?  And I already did.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  They won't know when or how.  Oh, you slide under the radar.  I am just like, you know, ozone air. 
[00:43:00]  Nice.  But good morning to you, Opie and Anthony, whatever your name is.  Glad that you're around, too.  Hey, Howard, we love you.  You know what?  Howard's not going to help you, Whoopi.  Yeah, Whoopi, sorry.  He's got his own problems to deal with.  You're such a stupid newbie.  He thinks, like, using Howard's name is going to get to us and get us all scared.  Howard's not helping you, Whoopi.  Howard ain't protecting you, Whoopi.  He's barely doing his own job these days.  I think he's off.  I think he's in the Hamptons somewhere.  All right, I don't even know if he's broadcasting. 
[00:43:30]  Who knows anymore when he broadcasts.  You know who can help her?  The DJ that's playing that stupid same beat behind her.  How about turning it down and talking?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Nobody wants to hear that.  Can't hear what that boar has to say with that beat going on behind it.  You're going to have to go to Plan B because Howard's not going to help you.  He doesn't give a crap about you and your stupid radio show.  I'm out in the Hamptons.  I can't be reached.  Please leave a message.  Hi, Howard.  It's Whoopi.  And I just want to say that ONA gave me trouble and I need your help. 
[00:44:00]  Beep.  Damn it.  Hi, this is Howard.  I'm in Hamptons.  You can't reach me right now, but I'll try to get back to you.  Stop it.  I invented the messaging machine.  Yeah, Howard, it's Whoopi.  I got cut off.  I just want to let you know that ONA, beep.  No, she didn't. 
[00:44:30]  Mailbox full.  Right.  Yeah, Howard's going to help you.  Sure he is.  Sure he is.  That's enough.  She's done.  Thanks.  Oh, and you know, there's nothing better than when people say something doesn't bother them over and over again  because it just means it really, really bothers them.  And it looks like the comment about calling her a bitch really got to her.  There's nothing you can do about that, Whoopi.  It sounds like she's going to try to do something behind the scenes.  What are you going to do?  Uh-oh.  You're going to sue me for calling you a bitch? 
[00:45:00]  You're going to get Ted Danson after you.  We won't know when.  No, what they're going to do is they're going to send Sister Act 2 over and we'll just kill ourselves watching it.  They're going to put us in straitjackets and make us watch that horse crap.  That was like some kind of veiled threat almost.  There's nothing to do, Whoopi.  Is it like some kind of a veiled threat?  Nothing.  He won't know what's coming, but.  Oof.  I have nothing.  Whoopi's West Coast.  All right.  So I'm trying to figure out what to do.  So right now I'll act like I'm working on a plan whenever I'm not. 
[00:45:30]  I'm just babbling while good old Cubster yucks it up.  Poor Cubby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I slide into the radar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you?  Cubby is the most like cherub, cherub looking white guy you'd ever see.  Holla.  And yeah, when he yesterday said holla because he's, you know, the co-host with a black woman.  So he's got to kind of black himself up, I guess.  Is that the strategy there? 
[00:46:00]  I guess.  Because when he said holla.  Ugh.  All right.  Just don't.  Stay out of the urban.  And by the way, we're going after Whoopi.  The vernacular.  We're going after Whoopi because it's fun.  We're not threatened by her and her awful show.  We're just dicks.  We're just dicks.  It's fun.  It is really fun for some reason.  And we're just flat out bored.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Stack. 
[00:46:30]  I'd sure like to be his girl.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the spoon position.  All right.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the super cam crameter.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Uh, let's go to Malik.  Malik, what's going on today?  Yo, what's good, my dude?  Hi.  What's slapping in?  Hey, what's popping, yo?  What's going on?  I heard Opie talking about this little gang situation.  What's popping?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We need your help, actually.  Uh, Detroit.  We're on in Detroit.  And we're doing, uh, quite well so far.  This is a fine sports station we're on.  And, uh, so far, so good for the Opie and Anthony Show.  They're very happy with what we've, uh, given them. 
[00:47:30]  And, uh, as a thank you, they sent us, uh, they sent us some Detroit Tigers, uh, jerseys.  Yeah, so what they got to do with the gang.  Well, all right, here.  Now, what does that have to do?  Are you a white black guy or are you a black guy?  Nah, come on, man.  Y'all know me, man.  I came up to the show.  You know I'm a brother, man.  I hear you, home.  What we need to know is if we'd be in any danger as white people wearing these,  are there certain colors that we don't know about? 
[00:48:00]  Nah.  It's not even about the colors.  Hold on.  I don't mean colors like colors.  Even stupid white people know that jerseys mean things now.  Yeah, I don't mean colors like colors.  Like, blah, blah, blah, red, blah.  I mean colors like your colors.  We got, we got black guys in New York wearing, like, Denver stuff.  And I know that means something.  They're not into, into the Denver Nuggets.  That's called their colors.  It just means something.  It's like, it's like, when you wear, when you wear, like, the, um, the, the L.A. Dodgers,  it's like that certain blue that stands for Crip. 
[00:48:30]  You, you're a Crip.  Right.  If you wear, like, uh, like Boston Red Sox red, that means you, you, I'm saying, like,  yellow and black is Latin King.  But as far as Detroit, come on, man, who walking around with Tony the Tiger Stripes and claiming  a gang?  Well, you make a good point.  And I even made the point, because I know this, that when you're white, you can wear whatever  color you want.  Nobody thinks you're a gang member.  No one thinks that anyone as white as us is a blood or a Crip.  If you're wearing blue in a blood area and you're white, I think you're dead. 
[00:49:00]  No, you're probably a cop.  Wait, Jimmy, not a whole blue uniform and a hat and a gun.  Jimmy thinks the gangs will leave Whitey alone.  No.  I say we dress you in half blue, uh, half blue?  Half blue, half red, yeah.  Half red, and we send you to Harlem to see what happens.  Nobody would care.  They know you're not, they worry about gang affiliation, and nobody looks at me and thinks  I'm a member of the opposing gang.  No one thinks that.  They don't think he's either a cop or he up there trying to hustle some drugs or something.  Yeah, buy some dope. 
[00:49:30]  But I mean, I can...  Yeah, he good.  Yeah, they don't, they're not going to bother a white guy in the wrong colors.  Unless you're a biker.  We'll have you tag a wall.  What's that?  We'll have you tag a wall with some spray paint over somebody else's tag.  Hi, I'm Jim.  Yeah, you can just look Jim.  So the Tigers jersey, it's old school, it's just white with the nice fancy D on the front.  We're all right wearing that.  Yo, you good, Money.  You ain't got nothing to worry about.  You good, all right?  Because it's a cool looking jersey.  I would love to wear it.  The only thing I like, I thank you Detroit for that, but they have our names on the back, 
[00:50:00]  which, you know, I'm not going to wear a jersey with my name on the back.  I want a Cobb jersey.  He's the greatest ever.  How do you not want a Cobb?  Yeah, you want to go old school, go around just blackening women's eyes with a Cobb jersey on.  Yeah, just shooting stuff into my stomach and punching women.  Godspeed.  All right, Malik, thank you.  All right, Keith.  Thanks, Malik.  All right, we're safe with the Tigers jersey.  Kenny, you want to add something to that?  Well, I'm so to Kenny, everyone.  Hi.  What's up, Kenny?  No, I was just standing by in case you needed me to talk to the brother. 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  What, in case you got out of line?  Then what?  No, like street lingo.  We talk street.  Because you're, you know, you're used to that.  Yeah, we take it down a street level.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hey, can I point out real fast?  I got an email.  I smashed G100 here in New York yesterday for sticking up for that reporter, and they said  they were actually, no, we didn't stick up for it.  We made fun of her.  And I blamed them for firing Christina Nagy, who was my friend, and they said no, that was  Clear Channel.  So if I screwed up, I apologize.  Boy, you an uninformed dope.  All right, yeah, but you know, you got to be honest. 
[00:51:00]  And if I said two things that were wrong, all right, let me shut my back face.  Two things back to back?  You're completely wrong.  Oops.  All right, so my apologies to the crew over there.  They didn't support Jody Applegate?  Who's Jody Applegate?  Was it that reporter?  That was the one from Fox in front.  God almighty, do I not pay attention?  I just mentioned her, and then I'm like, who is it?  Who, what?  All right.  Hey, Applegate.  Hey, just a little bit more on Whoopi, and then we, I promise we'll move on.  We shouldn't, though.  I can't get enough of this.  This is the greatest audio ever.  But someone called and said that she was actually talking about sunscreen and the ingredients 
[00:51:30]  in sunscreen, and I thought it was, I really thought it was a joke by one of our callers,  and I'm like, all right, we'll go with it, sure.  She can't possibly be talking about sunscreen.  We have the audio.  She's talking about sunscreen, and she thinks she's going to make it in New York radio.  Go back to Hollywood.  I'm going to give you some tips on sunscreen, because yesterday we were talking about sunscreen,  and I don't think I gave you as much information as you could use. 
[00:52:00]  Wait, wait.  How much information?  Because skin damage isn't only about aging.  Skin damage can actually kill you.  Now, some rays go through clouds and windows, so you need to always apply the lotion.  Most people get too much sun on their left side because of dry.  Ray Johnson, come through your window.  That music is enragingly awful.  We once had to do a radio show with music behind us.  With a bed.  They do that to distract the listener. 
[00:52:30]  Maybe you won't realize what you're hearing is just crap.  But why would you try to help people by giving them the sunscreen?  Who cares?  Here's a little word for all of our listeners.  Not only do I not care if all of you get skin cancer,  I am, in an odd way, rooting for it.  You know, Whoopi, Clear Channel hired you because they think you're a comedian.  Hello. 
[00:53:00]  People make mistakes.  Most people get too much sun on their left side because of driving.  The sun goes through the window.  A high SPF, which is sun protective factor, is not full protection.  No.  That is a myth.  Wow.  Some doctors say anything above SPF 15 is a waste of money.  Whoa, wow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, now.  That couldn't be true.  Stop it, Whoopi.  Stop it.  She's starting a whole industry up here. 
[00:53:30]  This is a problem.  SPF what?  I don't know.  15?  Oh, this is going to be one of the greatest radio disasters ever.  It rubs the lotion on its skin and then it gets canceled.  It puts the lotion on its skin and then Cubby laughs again.  Put the effing lotion in your dreadlocks.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Was she a real dark, ugly person?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  I got Mrs. Cubby's card in here.  Hey, we got to go to Texas for a quick second here.  Taylor, what's up?  What's up, y'all?  Hey.  What's happening, Taylor?  Man, you know what?  Yeah.  I went on the internet to look at your pictures.  I can't tell which one of you are Opie or Anthony.  It's really obvious.  Yeah, well.  How dumb are you?  I can't stand y'all, but I can't quit listening.  What's up with that?  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  We'll try to explain it.  I know.  I can't stand there and smack y'all around something a little bit, man.  I know.  That's called the ONA virus.  It sounds like something, you know, made up and one of those things like every show likes  to have a little catchphrase thing.  But it's just something that happens.  We don't know what it is, but you listen.  And like, you know, like the flu, you don't want it, but you're stuck with it.  It starts like you listen, starts maybe with like a scratchy throat or something, maybe  a little drip. 
[00:55:00]  I'm old, man.  I'm old.  And then before you know it, you're just...  22, maybe.  A full-blown ONA virus.  Yeah.  You know, we're well aware that there's a percentage of people that listen to us every  day that absolutely hate us.  Hate us, but they...  We're completely aware of that.  And if you don't like something, you would either tune away and forget about...  You'd forget about it.  These guys, like, write to us and message board posts and call us.  It's ridiculous.  I love...  We understand.  Whatever happens, you know, I just know I'm down here in Fort Worth. 
[00:55:30]  If I call y'all, I...  I'm gonna kill.  He hates us, this guy.  No, he does.  He's an alcoholic who no one else will talk to.  You sound like a drunk.  Right.  Taylor, here's the deal.  When you, uh, when you turn the corner and you start liking us, please give us a call  back, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  I think he's turning all ready.  Where's the phone?  Did he hang up?  Yeah, he...  Oh, I hope he was on his cell phone and he just hit something. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  An abutment.  Yeah, I hope a telephone pole just crashed down on him.  Guys.  End of this call.  Yeah.  So, Whoopi explains why you need sunscreen.  Oh.  I mean, it's still going?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was a whole hour of radio.  She played five, six songs and then the rest of the hour was talking about why you need  sunscreen.  This next clip is the ingredients in sunscreen and then the following clip after that, and  that's where we'll end for today.  Yeah.  Unless something crazy happens.  She explains how to apply sunscreen. 
[00:56:30]  Is there anyone over the age of five, if you don't know how to apply sunscreen, you  don't deserve to live in it.  That doesn't have a fat tongue and a Moe Howard from the Three Stooges hairdo.  That doesn't know how to put on sunscreen.  Is there anybody who doesn't ruin family photographs?  Who doesn't have...  You know what it is?  She's black.  Black people don't usually wear sunscreen, so she doesn't understand that white people,  we have been doing this since we're one. 
[00:57:00]  Well, maybe that's true.  Maybe there's some kind of racial thing here where we don't understand certain things in  the black community.  They don't understand certain things in the white community.  We have to lather up.  Yeah.  We've been putting this crap on our noses.  Mother's been doing this and putting it because it's got sand on it, the gritty sunscreen on  our faces since we were little lads and lessons.  You've blocked it out of your head.  That wasn't mommy and it wasn't sunscreen.  It wasn't a van and they squirted sunscreen all over my back and hair.  And I went home with it under my shirt, ashamed. 
[00:57:30]  It's protecting my back, isn't it, mister?  We've been making sure we've been putting on sunscreen since we were five.  Yeah, I had to.  So we get the better jobs and the better money.  That is the inappropriate bell.  You've got to hear it ring any time.  Got to make sure we stay as white as possible.  Something inappropriate.  I'm late for work again.  Try some sunscreen. 
[00:58:00]  My application goes to the top of the pile.  All right.  I'd like to hear the ingredients, though, because I've lost.  So would I.  Because in many years of labbing up, no one follows me in a store.  Mon-sodium glutamate?  I'd like to know what's in this.  I could walk around freely in department stores.  You could shop without the security cameras.  Following you around? 
[00:58:30]  It's a security guard repellent.  It's like off for bugs.  Sunscreen is a security guard repellent.  All right.  Here we go.  The ingredients.  You know what happens?  I rub on sunscreen.  Yeah.  I could drive 90.  I never get pulled over.  That's right.  You're driving a nice, fancy car through any neighborhood.  They're like, he must have worked hard and bought that with honest money.  And the sunscreen keeps that going.  I smell cocoa butter.  You can go.  Well, cocoa butter, smelling cocoa butter could get you pulled over. 
[00:59:00]  When they say, oh, it's on your arms, not in the hair.  Godspeed.  Get home safe.  No, that wasn't.  Of course it wasn't.  Inappropriate.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Here we go.  The ingredients in sunscreen.  The UVA rays go through clouds and windows, and there are only a handful of ingredients  which help block this race.  So you must read the label.  Make sure it's in there.  Zinc oxide. 
[00:59:30]  What's the zinc?  Titanium dioxide.  Boring.  Avobenzone.  Boring.  Avobenzone breaks down quickly.  So if you find it in a product, this isn't, is.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I buy a lot of.  And mechlor.  Boy, you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Where'd you get that sunscreen?  I got it from a negro.  We're tanks for nothing.  Hey, Whoopi. 
[01:00:00]  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Wow.  You're a disaster.  Day two, reading sunscreen ingredients.  Oh, wow.  Atrocious.  That is, that, you know, you make a great point.  You know, when anyone starts up a radio show, and then we have known for many, many months  that Whoopi was coming to town, right?  Yeah.  You would think her first week of shows would be amazing, because it would be months of 
[01:00:30]  material.  Preparation.  Story.  But she's already talking about the ingredients in sunscreen.  She's aft.  Here's some funny anecdotes.  Here's some advice, Whoopi.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life, and turn it into something funny.  Give that a whirl.  There you go.  People make mistakes.  All right.  We know we can.  All right.  Let's continue here.  And mexor, that's a spelling bee word.  It is.  Oh, it's the new one we were talking about yesterday, which is the mexorly. 
[01:01:00]  It's the best ingredient just approved by the FDA recently.  It's not in the products yet in this country.  Oh, it's the new one we were talking about today.  I...  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Steve.  Clip.  Oh, wow.  Wow. 
[01:01:30]  Boy, man.  I don't know how we're going to compete against this.  This is going to be hard.  Dude, she's a...  What are you...  We're going to have to make sure we got our A-game, guys.  This sucks.  Thank you.  Is this what happens when somebody gets so famous and is so...  I think she won the Oscar, right?  She's out of touch.  Do you become...  Do you have no friends in your life that just go, shut up?  Enough.  I am surrounded by people in my life who will tell me to shut up in a second.  Yeah.  They're awful, toxic friends, and they keep me from thinking that that discussion would 
[01:02:00]  be interesting.  You're looking one square in the eye right now.  Believe me.  And I see your lips quivering with a shut up behind them.  Yeah, Jimmy, shut up.  We got the third clip here.  You know what this is from?  Jimmy brings up a great point.  This is people...  Remember people said Olivier could read out of the phone book and make it interesting?  Yes.  She actually took this to heart and thinks that she could read from the back of a sunscreen  container, tube. 
[01:02:30]  So she's this insightful person who's just giving information.  Yeah.  Nobody wants that information.  I didn't know.  I got to read the zinc oxide.  What did she say?  Zinc oxide?  Yeah, that's...  I don't know.  I got to write this down.  We don't live on Venus?  Who cares?  How about this?  Sit in the car with the AC on.  Dope.  That's what I like.  We're not getting a horse and buggy rides to work.  Nice beer at a gin mill.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John.  Yo, what's happening, fellas?  Hey, Jen.  Yo, I got a problem with this whole thing here.  You know, Whoopi telling us how to put on sunscreen is like us telling her how to eat chicken and 
[01:03:00]  watermelon.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I didn't see that coming.  I'm sorry.  The listeners never know how to handle certain situations because it comes out as blatant,  ugly racism with no humor at all.  You know what we should tell how you sunscreen is the lady that wanted Oprah to drive her  home.  I want to see my children's.  I don't know him.  Remember that awful old woman who you just wanted to cave her head in with a planter? 
[01:03:30]  I want to go home.  He'll drive you home.  I don't know him.  That's awful.  Guys, we got to see how you apply sunscreen.  All right.  Now, the things that you need to know, Mike, you mentioned this yesterday.  You have to apply this stuff at least 20 minutes before you go outside.  And when applying, you have to use four twigs.  This can't be happening.  This is an SNL skid, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going much too long, and it's not funny at all. 
[01:04:00]  This can't be happening.  This is the number one radio market.  New York City.  Yeah.  And, by the way, we'll give her a plug.  Her show will be going national.  Well, it's going to reach Chicago.  Lucky you.  Chicago, we're giving you a little preview of some of the entertainment you'll have available in the coming weeks.  I'm sitting here going, this cannot be happening.  Here's the way.  If this cubby had one ounce of balls, here's the best way to apply sunscreen to your wife's eye.  He'd dab a little on your knuckles. 
[01:04:30]  Wait until she doesn't clean something up or cook for you.  Wait until the first time the game's on and she stands in front of the TV and you go, look, it's hot out.  There.  Now your eye won't burn.  Exactly.  If you don't want your nose to burn, get out of here.  Exactly.  Or apply it to the back of your hand and then give some to your children's faces.  I want some ice.  Do ya?  Old school.  Now go play in the sun.  You're safe.  Go out there and burn.  Your nose will peel.  It's cute. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Unfortunately, this is the last clip we'll play today from Whoopi.  Right.  We could do this all morning long, no problem.  And afternoon.  And afternoon.  We could do it when we're not on the radio.  We're going to do it at home.  Yeah.  Now the things that you need to know, Mike, you mentioned this yesterday.  You have to apply this stuff at least 20 minutes before you go outside.  That's right.  And when applying, you have to use four times as much as you think you need.  Well, my question is if you apply it when you get out.  Did Whoopi just buy stock in Coppertone?  Is there, like, something going on here? 
[01:05:30]  Dude, this is the important thing.  Cubby has a question.  Oh, damn.  And the only thing I respect...  Holla.  Cubby.  Cubby, you dishonest ass.  You know this is awful radio.  You've been doing radio a long time.  Shut her up and get her to say something funny.  This is why I would respect if Cubby goes, I have a question.  Why don't we both kill ourselves?  I'm going to apply sunscreen to your face with this shotgun.  The sunscreen is great to seal the windows when you have a hose in the one end of the  exhaust pipe. 
[01:06:00]  Times as much as you think you need.  Well, my question is if you apply it when you get outside, what does it matter?  If you have 20 minutes maybe to get some sun and it'll start working?  No, it'll soak in.  You want to put it on before you go out there.  So it soaks into your skin so you protect it.  So if you put it on outside, it won't have time to soak.  It'll dry up.  Well, it won't have time to soak.  And that's why they're telling you to put it on free.  Holy mother of God himself.  I'd like to apply it to her face with a tennis racket. 
[01:06:30]  Man.  Little team squares that aren't burned.  Wow, does she stink on ice?  This is okay.  This could be the greatest stuff for our show.  The lawyers have got to fight for us.  Make sure we're allowed to continue playing her crap.  How could it be that we could have so much fun with this and when she's doing it, it's such awful radio.  Maybe tomorrow she can play her own audio and just trash it. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  What a brilliant idea.  Every other day you have a great show because you just do this crappy show,  but the next day you completely make fun of what garbage you put out over the air.  And poor Cubbykins, he tries to be interesting.  He jumps in.  I got a question.  If you apply it as you go out, you get 20 minutes of sun.  He was trying to tie it up.  And she goes, oh no, you want to do it beforehand so you don't get any sun.  It's got to soak in.  Thanks, Lurch.  Soak in.  Almighty.  Oh my God. 
[01:07:30]  She has the humor value of the hand that comes through the box in the Addams Family.  She just opens the box and the hand goes, flirn, flirn, flirn, and you close the box.  You're a stand-up, Whoopi.  What are you doing?  Forging ahead.  Oh, Whoopi, you better call Howard because it's getting ugly.  Oh, yeah.  Better call him.  He'll save you.  The humor of the old lady coming out of the tub in The Shining.  Exactly.  With less sex appeal.  Holy crap.  This can't be.  Come on.  We want to move on with our radio show, but we can't help ourselves. 
[01:08:00]  Laurie.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey, Laurie.  The sunscreen is nothing.  She's now polling every guy in the studio and poor Cubby.  She's asking them when they had their last PSA test and describing the test and why everyone,  every man in New York should have one.  A what test?  A PSA.  It's for, like, you know, prostate cancer.  Oh, she's talking about prostate exams now? 
[01:08:30]  Does she mean by a doctor or something you paid a prostitute to administer?  I'd like to join in on that poll.  You know, she's breaking one of the cardinal rules of radio also.  Too many subjects at once.  There's going to be some poor bastard who rubs sunscreen on his prostate and she could be sued.  And you're looking at him.  I can't wait to get home and do that.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  What's going on, O&A?  Hey, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  No, I just got into work, man. 
[01:09:00]  And she, sure enough, is sitting there talking about how you should go get your prostate checked out.  Well, again, talking about something she knows nothing about.  I know.  Sunscreen and prostate.  What else is he going to talk about?  If your testicles hurt.  Thank you, stupid.  Oh, mighty.  Just stop it.  Doug in Texas.  Doug.  Hey, I just want to say keep up the whoopee radio.  This is the funniest thing I ever heard.  Dude, there's nothing greater.  I'm now hoping she really lasts a little while.  Because it's just too good.  I'm drinking this audio like it's an elixir. 
[01:09:30]  I'm praying.  You got a PSA test.  Oh, shut up.  I'm praying that she's pulling a fast one on all of us.  I'm just kidding, man.  Wouldn't that be a great gimmick, too?  That would be great.  Maybe a week later, two weeks later, she goes, look, the last two weeks of radio, that was a joke.  I was just definitely joking.  I was really screwing with you because that could not possibly have been entertaining.  Here comes whoopee radio.  That's right.  And then she starts a new show.  Maybe Cubby can bend over. 
[01:10:00]  We'll just leave it there.  All right.  Of course I got it.  I got distracted when dumb Steve walked in showing like Ben Gay.  Stop.  How old are you, 70?  Oh, my goodness.  You really do.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Okay, Steve.  Just taking a leave.  It does the same thing.  Apology accepted.  We don't have to smell you.  I'll give you a PSA test with Freddy Krueger gloves on.  Donna in Florida.  Yes, a PSA.  That's awful.  All right.  We got to take a break, but Donna has something for the show.  Donna.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Donna. 
[01:10:30]  I'm telling you, I'm relating to that first call from Texas before about, I hate to  show, too.  I can't stop listening.  Why do you hate us?  We're sorry.  I know.  We're nice people.  Well, first of all, I think I've become Jim's biggest fan in the universe right now.  I'm completely in love with that guy.  Thank you.  Besides that, it's like an addiction.  It all started with, you guys were ranking on the Top Gun movie about a month or so ago.  I haven't been able to miss a minute since that day. 
[01:11:00]  But you hate us.  I hate you guys.  It's ridiculous.  It's stupid.  It's senseless.  And I never...  She's just described the program perfectly.  Another promo.  Thank you.  Another promo.  You made a promo.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Donna, are you listening in West Palm Beach?  I think we're at Lauderdale.  Oh, okay.  I'll leave you here in Florida.  That's right.  I'm listening off the buzzer.  All right.  We'll see you in the winter.  We're coming down to West Palm.  We're going to make believe we really care about West Palm Beach when the weather changes  here in New York.  When it gets cold here.  You watch us start talking about West Palm Beach. 
[01:11:30]  And we'll be down there telling you how to put on your winter clothing and to keep on.  And you know what?  She has as much right to talk about prostate cancer.  Prostate sick-ups is.  All right.  She just doesn't...  You know what?  The phone crapped out mercifully.  We're having her mercifully.  I'm Donna, yeah.  We're having a lot of fun.  You know, the reality is no one wants to hear this crap when they're driving to work.  Can I say drivel?  Well, if you know, the FCC's cracking down.  Okay.  And I bet she got with her girls in Hollywood.  And she started, like, testing some of this stuff out. 
[01:12:00]  And no one had the balls, like Jimmy was saying earlier, to say, that's like a fly in New York.  The Hollywood elite usually are surrounded by people.  They're yes people.  That's it.  Barbara Streisand's another one.  And she puts out on her website all the time these words of wisdom about things she has no business getting her big nose in, the goddamn war, anything else.  And she writes, and I'm sure she runs it past people, and they go, Babs, this is genius.  And it's dreck. 
[01:12:30]  It's awful nothingness.  Here's what her stupid website should say every day.  Hi.  I sing good, and I have a nose like an isosceles triangle.  Tea bagging, please.  And with that, we'll take a break.  Bill Burr joins the program after the commercials.  Does he?  Our comic friend.  Yeah, it's very exciting.  We're very close to our first ONA Traveling Virus show.  Yes, Saturday night in Boston.  At the DCU Center.  And we're going to be broadcasting live from WBCN Friday. 
[01:13:00]  And they're setting up all sorts of activities for the fans and the pests outside WBCN.  And don't worry, cities that are listening to us right now, we'll be coming your way.  Well, we've got to build an audience.  Oh, that's what I mean.  We're starting to pay attention to Pittsburgh.  It looks like the audience is building there.  Chicago, let's be honest, it's going to take a while.  West Palm.  Maybe we'll get to Chicago next summer.  We can vacation to West Palm without being bothered by listeners.  You don't want to do well there?  All right, so we're not bothered?  Bill Burr's in next, and to tell you the truth, he's here to hype the Boston date. 
[01:13:30]  We need to sell a few more tickets.  All right.  All right, we'll do that next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's time for another O.P. and Anthony Show scream-along.  Shut up, shut up. 
[01:14:00]  Okay, terrific.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Get in touch with the O.P. and Anthony Show right now by phone 866-WOW1-WOW  or go to instantfeedbackonline at O.P.andAnthony.com.  We're just a-hole.  Horrid.  Rock and roll.  Let me just play this under everything we say today so we can be more like other radio 
[01:14:30]  shows.  Know what this sounds like?  What?  Savage animals!  We got savage animals!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're really excited today.  I think you can hear it in our voices.  The faithful listeners, they know.  Wow.  Why the energy today, guys?  I'll tell you why.  We're live in Chicago.  We're in San Francisco.  The virus spreading. 
[01:15:00]  That's right.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  You know what I want?  I want a map of the United States in my house so I can stick little pins in it like that  big-headed freak from Mask.  I just loved when he was so disappointed by Ben.  Look, I'm not going to Europe with you.  He just couldn't picture the 12-hour flight with that stupid Down syndrome skull next to  him.  That huge freak head.  Poor Rocky Dennis probably had to take two different headphones and tape them together 
[01:15:30]  so he could watch the on-flight movie.  Here's a rake.  Comb your hair.  We're leaving.  Had to buckle up his head.  Wow.  Sir, could you check your head, sir?  I'm sorry.  You can't sit in the emergency aisle.  Your head won't fit through the exit.  I love when the blind girl feels his face and you can see that internally she went, oh,  Jesus.  God.  Why?  Big smooth-skinned idiot. 
[01:16:00]  It was smaller than the triceratops head she felt in Jurassic Park.  And more attractive.  That's attractive.  That's attractive.  Hey, let me.  Is that out of the way?  With that, let's say hi to Bill Burr.  Bill Burr joining the program.  Hey, gentlemen.  And Bill's coming to Boston with us.  Yes, he is.  We got town.  Worcester, Boston.  Worcester, Boston.  Yes.  Jesus.  Yeah, we're playing Worcester because I'll tell you why.  The mayor's still holding a grudge up there in Boston for our little April Fool's prank 
[01:16:30]  we did.  It's eight years ago.  A mayor's day.  I know.  He holds a grudge.  It was eight lousy years ago.  Come on.  Joke's on him, though.  Worcester is gorgeous.  So we had to.  This time of year.  So we had to take the O&A traveling virus and take it way out of Boston.  Because we couldn't get permits or anything.  He's making it really tough for us to succeed in Boston.  So years ago.  He had to stay the way.  Yeah.  Years ago, Opie had to get a brilliant idea of saying that the mayor of Boston was dead  when he, in fact, wasn't on April Fool's. 
[01:17:00]  Maybe you were happy making crap money.  I decided to make a lot more money for us, and I knew how to do it.  I was just happy to be there working.  I knew how to do it.  I didn't think it would get us fired, but, man.  It was time to open up that door and go from black and white to color.  Ran out like the Wizard of Oz.  Ran out on a rail, though, man.  I knew the game back then.  You can't do that anymore.  We've talked about it many times on the show and in interviews.  But, yeah.  When you screwed up, you screwed up. 
[01:17:30]  That's right.  And that's what happened.  And they escorted us to Connecticut and told us not to return.  And now we can come back.  We can do a show, but...  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Not me.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I live in Belleville, and I saw this stupid little midget.  This little black midget with two stupid ponytails in her head, 
[01:18:00]  a stupid little hot pink mini shirt with blue jeans,  standing, waiting across the street while one of her stupid normal friends.  A lot of...  Sounds very stupid.  A lot of stupids in there.  Was she doing anything that was odd for a midget?  Besides breathing?  Across the street, looking up at her friend, just going,  God, I wish I was your height.  If midgets did things that weren't odd,  they'd all be tugging on their own umbilical cords.  That's what they should be doing. 
[01:18:30]  Of course, she was just hoping that her mother wrapped the umbilical cord around her neck.  My favorite midget stories, though, they're good midget sighting, by the way.  My favorites are the ones where they see them in supermarkets or various things.  And what I mean by silly sighting is when the guy goes,  I saw a shopping cart that I thought was moving on its own.  And then I looked and saw those little Vienna sausage knuckles fingers  on top of the little thing that pushes the cart  and realized it was indeed a midget.  And then they can only buy half of what's in the supermarket 
[01:19:00]  because the humiliation of having to ask some 19-year-old kid,  could you please grab me that cereal?  I did a gig down in Baltimore.  There was a midget couple right in the front row.  How do you do that now?  Do you goop on them or think it's too hack?  Yeah, it's way too hack.  I don't think it's hack if they're in there.  Like, if they're right in front of you, it's just tasteless and awful.  I just remember one point I was making fun of how short Hitler was,  and all of a sudden I just felt real self-conscious.  Oh, yeah.  Why, did he have a little mustache? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, sure, I get it.  That's such a dope.  I didn't even realize it was a joke.  Actually, no, I was talking about his height.  Oh, I got you.  All right, we should have asked if they each only had to drink one drink.  Two straws, please.  The one item minimum for you, fella.  Hey, Frank, thank you.  They came in on each other's shoulders with a long trench coat on.  Just paid for one.  Little rascal style.  Yeah.  Oh, the ONA Traveling Virus, yes, presented by Bud Light. 
[01:20:00]  So it's this Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.  And we're broadcasting live from WBC on this Friday.  And I was talking to Dave Wellington,  and it sounds like they're going to throw a party for us when we broadcast live Friday morning.  That would be nice.  Supposedly, the first 104 listeners that show up outside BCN will get free tickets to the ONA Traveling Virus.  104.  Gee, what number is that?  Where did they pick that number out of?  And what else we got going on, Steve?  A harmonica choir. 
[01:20:30]  A what?  A what?  20 or 30 harmonica players all playing in unison.  You can take Bill's mic for a second.  He won't bite you.  What is it?  It's not like Ben Gay, Bill.  You like it?  It's awful.  Like your grandmother doing radio next to you.  Yeah, only sexier.  Steve K.  They have, I think it's called the Boston Harmonica Choir,  and it's like 20 or 30 harmonica players all playing big bands.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[01:21:00]  That's just like having hot chicks in the parking lot to entertain everybody.  Yeah, that's good.  Wow.  For those of you that are doubting that we're still on the edge, harmonica's people.  I don't know why you would doubt us.  Wow.  Harmonica players?  Yeah.  Wow.  Unless we do have girls, and those harmonicas are put in certain places while the guys play  them, I think it's a wash.  Now, that would be a trick.  That is a trick.  Let them play the harmonicas without using their mouths or hands. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  There you go.  Now, that would be a talent.  That's right.  Every time they do jumping jacks, it sounds like an accordion.  Now, that I'd want to see.  Horrific idea.  Isn't it awful?  Eyes lit up.  An army of harmonicas.  Harmonica players.  Harmonica players and free tickets.  I think they're going to be cooking up, of course, some kind of sausage product.  Yeah, of course.  Right?  Oh, that's great.  Just to make it more homo. 
[01:22:00]  Why sausage?  So I could take the back of your head, put my hand on it, and push your face into it.  No need, pal.  He goes willingly.  Oh.  All right, so.  I hope they're cheese stuffed.  Hey, what's the lineup for Boston?  I got that info in front of me here.  If not, I'm going to feel self-conscious.  What am I doing wrong?  All right, here we go.  The lineup for the.  Can't get any cheese out of this one.  The lineup for the DCU Center.  Bob Saget.  Jim Norton. 
[01:22:30]  Bob Kelly.  Bill Burr.  Patrice O'Neill.  Rich Voss.  Tracy Morgan.  Ralphie May.  We got the Dunking Booth Clown and a whole O&A village that we're setting up.  So it's going to be a great time this Saturday.  Tickets through Ticketmaster.com or Ticketmaster locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  And more info can be found on opandanthony.com.  How about the Harmonica people?  Are they going to come out to Worcester?  Dare to dream.  I hope not.  They're just going to be part of the live broadcast on Friday.  Damn it, I wish I was going to be there.  So I tell Dave he's got to like spice it up a little bit. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, sausages, harmonica players, and free tickets.  Wow.  It's just exciting.  Can't wait to get there.  Can't wait.  That's always a great treat when it's like 90 degrees out at 7 in the morning.  Who wants a sausage?  Yeah.  Anybody want a kielbasa?  Nice hot sausage at an ungodly morning hour where it's still dark out.  It's still last night when we come in.  Give me a break.  Take a bite out of it and somewhere in the country a midget wakes up grabbing his hands screaming. 
[01:23:30]  Those awful hands.  It's five little Vienna sausages and a muffin for a palm.  When you shake a midget's hand, that's what it feels like.  You don't even have to have a midget in the room.  Just five Vienna sausages and a muffin.  A warm, soft muffin.  Yeah.  And just shake it.  Those biking gloves, it looks like pigs in a blanket at the IHOP.  Well, you ought to do it, it's actually legal to do this when you meet a midget. 
[01:24:00]  If he puts his hand to shake it, you can actually grab it and dip it in warm butter and eat it.  It's perfectly acceptable.  It's allowed now.  Keep screaming, little fella.  Guys, it's not going to stop me.  I got to break in because one of our favorite people is calling in.  Who?  Marge?  Good morning, gentlemen.  What's up, Marge?  It's Marge from the little shelter out on Long Island.  Right.  Hello, gentlemen.  First of all, I just wanted to tell you that the Harley raffle was a huge success.  What Harley raffle? 
[01:24:30]  I'm here to tell you.  No, it's also a success that you're still alive with all this heat.  Wait a minute.  That's why I'm...  You're the first to go.  What's going on?  First to go with the elderly.  That's right.  In this blazing...  How the hell are you surviving this heat there, Marge?  Hold your fire.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Cease fire.  Whoa.  Check your fire.  Check your fire.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  All right.  Do you want to see little animals suffer in this heat?  More than I can imagine.  Check your show, Marge.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  I have some tips.  You got tips how to keep your pets cool?  That is correct, sir.  Oh, please help.  Go ahead.  Oh, good.  Drown them in a pool.  So I'm hoping that all of your...  Wait, Marge?  Yeah?  I have little, like, newborn kittens, actually, and I kept them cool by throwing them in  the tub.  Does that work?  Yeah.  Marge?  Listen to me.  Okay.  I know it made it fun.  Because the kittens survived for a while, but, like, Jimmy, like, made sure there was  margarine all around the sides of the tub just in case one got lucky. 
[01:25:30]  A little slippery.  Right.  A little slippery slope.  Yeah.  Are you ready?  I put my terrier in the freezer before I came over.  Is that going to keep them cool?  This is the most important thing.  Marge, Marge, before you get started, because we want you to give these tips, believe me,  because it is very important.  It is important to keep your animals alive in this heat.  But I just want to let you know that I know a little bit about this.  When you're driving with your dog and you have to go inside a building, make sure, roll those  windows up tight and lock the doors, and then go shopping for a while so no one steals 
[01:26:00]  your car.  Because they pant.  He's going to punish you.  I'm clear.  And they pant.  He's going to punish you and Mel Gibson.  You don't know, Bob.  And it's actually cooler.  Well, if your dog is a Jew, then he'd...  This is so ridiculous.  Marge.  Every minute that I'm on the phone has to be somebody's dog that is...  Hey, Marge, Marge, you grew up in the 60s, right?  I'm not saying.  Is putting to sleep dogs a gas?  Oh, God. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, that's so...  That's so lame.  Are you ready?  Marge.  Marge is calling me a hack.  Marge.  There are too many animals out there anyway, so the heat wave...  The heat wave like thins the herd.  Right.  The first tip that I have, pet lovers, pet owners, listen, try to listen to this advice.  It'll say you'll like a pet.  Oh, write a little advice.  You know.  Put the goldfish bowl in the sun.  Despite what these people have said, never, never, never leave pets in a closed car. 
[01:27:00]  Even with the windows cracked.  Marge.  I've read studies.  I've read studies that just...  You leave the keys in the ignition.  If they get hot, they turn it on and turn on the AC.  Hey, Marge.  Your tips stink.  Everyone knows that.  Give us a tip that we could use.  We know you're not supposed to keep your dog in a car with the windows rolled up.  That's common sense.  You had a Lhasa Opsa.  You come out and there's a broiled turkey in your seat.  No, you don't know.  Bon appetit. 
[01:27:30]  I'm looking outside now and I'm seeing smart people exercising their dogs.  Where are you?  Certainly not on Long Island.  I am on Long Island.  I'm proud of it.  What's wrong with Long Island?  Nothing.  I grew up a block away from the little shelter, Marge.  But that area...  I live behind Fred's Diner.  Did you know that?  What?  Your block has been condemned.  No, it hasn't.  Yes, it has.  Sorry, sir.  Barry Place?  Yes, Barry.  Is that where you grew up?  I grew up on two Barry Place right behind Fred's Diner.  Condemned. 
[01:28:00]  Why?  Put it all down.  Why?  But they're naming a street after you.  My childhood.  Well, that's the way it goes.  Listen, by the way, before I go to these tips, I wanted to...  Tips.  Hey, I got a great radio show for you to call.  It's called Whoopi in the Morning.  Right.  I think Whoopi...  Whoopi would love this crap.  Whoopi would love that.  Although, how do you keep Whoopi from overheating with that big head of dreadlocks?  She's a very...  Does Cubby put a bowl of water out for her?  But you know what?  Yes.  Whoopi has great skin. 
[01:28:30]  Does she?  Yeah, she has really beautiful skin.  Unless the lights are really bright.  The rest of her...  The rest of her stinks.  But the skin is great.  The rest of her stinks.  Yeah, Mel Gibson says it would make a great lampshade.  All right, I'm not commenting on that.  Mel is an anti-Semitic racist.  This is an important thing.  Okay, another tip.  I would like to invite the two of you...  No.  ...to a barbecue.  No.  You don't have enough cash, Marge.  Unless you're barbecuing dogs, because that would be fun to watch.  You mean you... 
[01:29:00]  I really would like to get to know you guys more.  You're not a size 14.  You're not coming to the barbecue.  No.  I don't think we're coming to the barbecue.  All right, if that's the way you feel it.  Unless you're serving, like, kitten shish kebabs.  Then I will invite Whoopi and Don.  I like a little, like...  How's that?  What?  Some dog hummus.  I'll invite Whoopi and Don.  No, we don't want Whoopi at our barbecue.  But you're not coming, so why do you care?  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Why are you yelling?  Yes, not yelling.  Marge is an angry woman.  No, you know what?  I'm not...  I just... 
[01:29:30]  It's very difficult to speak to you.  All right, let's let Marge speak.  No, it's not.  It's easy.  Look.  Marge.  We'll let you talk.  Give us some more tips on keeping your animals cool during this heat wave.  Okay.  Marge.  Hello?  When you walk your dog, make sure you have plenty of water.  Wait, wait, wait.  Start over.  Start over.  Your phone cut out.  What's walking a dog?  When you walk your dog...  You leave them in the house, don't you?  Well, you have to let them out.  For what?  To do their...  You just got done saying these smart people were walking their... 
[01:30:00]  All right, hold on.  What's the walking tip?  I asked you if you have to walk your dog early in the morning before it gets hot.  Marge.  We know that, Marge.  Give us something we don't know.  Yeah.  Here's one for you.  All right.  When traveling with a dog in a car, do not let him put his head out the window.  Oh, that's adorable.  Their little ears flap.  Small objects.  And then they...  Small objects.  ...can blow into his eyes.  I like getting behind gravel trucks with my dog hanging out the back. 
[01:30:30]  And as my windshield cracks, I like watching his face come apart like Raiders of the Lost Ark.  That's right.  Good Lord.  Is there no end?  That's right.  You know what?  Is there no end?  No.  After a ride like that, he doesn't bark as much in the middle of the night.  He learns a little respect.  I love it.  A little beagle.  His ears flapping.  Much like what's under your blouse.  Do not take them to the beach.  What?  You drive a little closer to a picket fence. 
[01:31:00]  Why can't I take my dog to the beach?  It's hazardous.  Pippet?  Yes.  Pippet?  First of all...  Pippet?  Yes.  Pippet?  Remember that?  He was throwing a stick to Pippet, his dog?  Of course.  A shark could eat him, right?  Marge, isn't that the reason?  Whatever.  There's no...  Marge just blew me off.  Yeah, I know.  There's no shade at the beach.  The sun is so penetrating.  What about all those umbrellas?  Marge, should I apply sunscreen to my dog?  It doesn't really help. 
[01:31:30]  Why?  Because they lick it off.  And not only that...  I bet you know about that, don't you?  Did you hear...  What?  You gave up on peanut butter?  Yeah.  Heard that old joke, did you?  All right.  Marge is a card.  No one really pisses me off when Marge calls.  There's actually people listening out there that are listening to Marge with these tips.  Marge, do you know how many people are getting in touch with Little Shelter to say that they  have such pity on me? 
[01:32:00]  Well, yeah.  Taking all of these views.  But they are...  Hold on, Marge.  There's someone calling in.  Oh, no.  Pardon you, schtick.  Someone is calling...  You're loving it.  ...to defend you.  Okay.  And I hate these people.  We're just trying to have fun with Marge, and then you've got serious people calling in.  They're actually...  Okay.  I'm here.  All right.  Steve.  Hello.  Hello.  This is Steve.  Hello.  Steve.  Go ahead.  Steve is calling from one of our newer markets, Yellowstone.  How are you doing, Steve?  I'm okay, but I don't like the way this is all being made light of.  Is Marge available? 
[01:32:30]  Yes, I am.  Go ahead, Steve.  Thank God for you.  Marge, you know, I don't understand why it is that when it comes to healthy animals  who may be suffering or doing really awful promotion work lately, why did people decide  to make fun of it and belittle it?  I don't know.  I would just...  Oh, man!  Don't!  Hello?  Oh, man, all the people deserve to die in the heat. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, Lord!  Marge should use her tongue to give her a rat while her his PSA can.  Can I continue with my tip?  Oh, Lord!  Marge should rub the pink lips to my doggy in her face until she has enough sunscreen all  over it.  About... 
[01:33:30]  You asked me a really good question.  Yes, I really do want to know...  A pertinent question.  Steve, listen to this.  What?  You should not take your dog to the beach because not only about the sun, but...  Marge.  Marge.  The sand gets in their little paws.  Yeah.  Marge, wait, Marge, you're not answering my question, though.  What's the question?  No!  I hope, Marge, you're sexually assaulted by a Haitian orderly wearing white nurse shoes.  You know what? 
[01:34:00]  Haitian orderly.  Yes, Marge.  You know, I'm just appalled.  I would be too.  I'm sorry that got through our screener that Steve was not indeed Steve from Yellowstone.  I think that was a...  It's something somebody named Marge would be called, flabbergasted.  Marge, we got...  I don't know you.  Who is this?  Don't come here.  I'm hanging up the phone.  Prank calling.  Prank calling.  Marge.  Yes, sir.  We have to go.  So get your snowsuit on and walk your dog. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  You take care now.  All right.  Yeah, there goes Marge from the little shelter.  Yellowstone, Steve from Yellowstone, you can't always count on him calling.  From another studio, he destroys the guests that are boring.  Steve's the guy who heckles on the phone.  Then he'll end up yelling for him.  He is Steve from Yellowstone.  He has got an endless supply of verbal landmines.  When guests are wasting time, he keeps the guest in line. 
[01:35:00]  God, does that stink.  Way to take a cool bit and make it baggy.  Steve Kipped in the line.  She is.  He sure did.  Wow, she is something.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Marge.  Good old Marge.  I'd rather be able to see if she was mauled to death by an animal. 
[01:35:30]  Like that stupid lady in Tennessee, Winky the Elephant, tap-danced on her.  She's been helping these things her whole life.  Or that idiot trying to give a monkey a birthday cake.  The chimp that ate his...  His whole crotch was eaten off.  Oh, yes.  He ate that.  His face.  Fingers.  Pulled his foot off.  Ate his hand.  His wife's thumb.  Oh.  Ah, beeper.  Ow.  All right.  Let's say hi to Teresa.  Teresa.  You'll be at him dressed in overalls, too.  A little engineer's hat on.  Engineer. 
[01:36:00]  A little work boots like he's on the job.  Teresa.  Hello.  Hi, Teresa.  Come aboard, Terry.  Hello, hello.  Is she ever going to learn not to call?  No.  She must have been an abused wife or an abused child that she just calls.  She likes to make a point.  Make a point?  You can only try to make your point so much.  Yeah.  All right.  Come on now.  Well, thank you guys so much.  She's trying to support her cause.  We make her feel smart.  All right.  Bill Byrne Studio.  We've got to take a break. 
[01:36:30]  Hello, Bill.  We'll continue.  Here to hype Worcester.  Here to hype, yeah.  Here to hype the ONA virus.  Yeah, not here to hype Guildhall.  At the DCU Center.  This coming Saturday, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you for calling Career Match.  Please state your qualifications after the tone, and our computer database will provide  you with an appropriate career choice.  Well, I play pinball.  I'm up to level 46 in EverQuest, if that's one of my resume stuffer.

Our computer shows that your career choice should be douchebag talk show host.  Thank you for calling Career Match.  Yeah, Dave.  I'm scared. 
[01:37:30]  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  All right, man.  I'm traveling down the dirt bike going soft on out here, and the sticker just came in  to real good use for me.  I just got wowed.  This woman's putting on makeup, looks at me, sees the sticker, makes sure she gets my  attention, and shows me both of them.  Bravo.  See, that's how it works.  It's great, guys. 
[01:38:00]  The stickers actually work.  Yeah, you got to get the wowed stickers on your car, man.  Whip them out Wednesday definitely works.  It's actually whip them out whenever, and we'll get into that a lot more tomorrow.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, do me one favor, would you?  What?  You got the spit with Anthony where he calls up the whorehouse at Nevada with the Tourette's  syndrome.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I only caught half that one day on XM, and it is beautiful.  Would you mind throwing that on during a break today?  How about we'll end the show with that?  Absolutely. 
[01:38:30]  Someone back time it.  We'll end a little early, and we'll play that for Dave.  All right?  Sounds good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks a lot, fella.  Thanks for remembering.  Today's a busy day.  It's not your birthday.  It's not your birthday.  It was a few weeks back.  Hey, we need to talk to Steve Dahl.  We're starting up in Chicago on WCKG, and Steve wants to just say hi and wish us some  luck here.  We do have the latest Gibson audio, too.  Bill Gibson.  Oh.  I thought you meant Henry. 
[01:39:00]  For you old, old people.  You're laughing.  Here's the latest audio.  Years ago.  I was a little kid.  I used to peek out from my bedroom and watch Rona Martin laughing.  He was 36.  It was not 36.  Here's Mel Gibson.  Gibson also said he's battled alcoholism all his life and is taking steps to return to  help.  As for his career, at least one industry leader, Agent Ari Emanuel, is calling on Hollywood 
[01:39:30]  to give Gibson the cold shoulder.  Gibson was also arrested in 1984 in Toronto for drunk driving.  And tonight, Gibson's reps confirmed that he is undergoing treatment.  Yeah, and the front page of the post has a Mel Gibson party picture.  Mad Mel.  He just looks like he's having a really good time.  Time of his life with a couple of Aryan girls.  A couple of very young blondes.  He's completely hammered.  The front page of the post.  You got to just pick up the post today for the front page. 
[01:40:00]  This one girl.  Like, Mel Gibson is completely out of it.  He has his arms around two broads.  And the one girl is trying to make a point because she's got Mel Gibson's attention.  Yeah.  Look, she's got the finger in the air.  She's trying to make some kind of poignant point.  And then I told this guy, I don't need you because I'm my own person.  Right.  And I want to be an actress.  But I have my morals.  And I'm not going to compromise myself for anything. 
[01:40:30]  And Mel's just like, when do your pants come off?  Right.  My agent wants me to do commercials, but I just don't feel it's artistic enough.  I'm about to work.  Really?  Do you know the Jews run Hollywood?  Well, my agent is Jewish.  I didn't realize that there was others.  Get away from me.  You're tainted.  What a mess he is.  I'll play with your tainted.  I didn't mean tainted like that, baby.  Get in the next Mel, Mac. 
[01:41:00]  And this girl just wants the picture with Mel.  That's why she's smiling at the camera.  Her friend's obviously taking the picture.  Get a picture of me with Mel.  I got to tell you one thing.  His mug shot, it's like a head shot.  Oh, he's got that little Superman hair coming out.  He's got a little curl in the front like Superman.  It is the best photo I've ever seen of this guy.  He's absolutely dreamy.  He's smiling because he knows the whole world's going to see this picture.  He's kind of looking up.  Well, you've seen the mug shots on Smoking Gun. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  They're horrific.  Everybody's is.  Yasmin Bleeth is on there just looking a wreck.  No, you know what he was saying right there?  Look at his face.  He was just going, you know who runs Hollywood?  And then they snap at me and say, the Jew.  The Jew.  Well, that was his like.  That prison echo.  His mouth is pulled back because he's going, he.  He looks like a smile, but he's slowly saying, he.  Oh, God.  I like how they're blaming his racism on the alcohol.  Yeah.  Like that's what, oh, yeah, it was the alcohol. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Rather than that brought out my inner thoughts.  Every time I have a few too many, you know, tip it back, I go off on the polls.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just I can't stop talking about Polish people.  You know what's interesting about the latest here?  A rep for Mel Gibson says, the guy is just trying to stay alive.  Alive?  Please, the guy is trying to bang young blondes in Hollywood.  He's not an alcoholic.  His nose isn't red.  He's a great looking guy.  He went out, he got hammered, and the man, he spoke his mind. 
[01:42:30]  There is not one vein showing in the whites around those dreamy baby blues.  Not at all.  They really are seductive.  You couldn't not sleep with them.  Male or female.  I'm not entirely Mel Gibson.  No, but his mugshot, dreamy.  That's what that blonde is saying.  I'd still blow him.  Jesus.  That is a mugshot slash tiger beat cover.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  So that's the latest on Mel.  He's pretty much screwed in Hollywood.  Oh.  And everyone is, you know, paying attention to the Mel Gibson story.  And Michael Starr, he's just terrific.  He writes a fine column in the New York Post.  Does he?  I guess he writes about radio here and there.  And he thought that Jim Kerr's comments on the Mel Gibson's situation was just terrific here in New York City.  Was it for a minute in between a Van Halen song and a Queen song? 
[01:43:30]  You know what sucks?  Jim Kerr is a rock jock that's playing the same old rock songs.  Yeah.  And he's beating us in the ratings.  That is kind of sad.  It's very sad.  That's our next target here in New York City.  Jim Kerr.  We've got to compete against a jukebox.  So I guess they learned a good strategy is to play the rock stars on their records on your station and not put them behind the mics as the host of your station.  Well, yeah.  There you go.  That's a little smarter. 
[01:44:00]  They just moved it a little over to the right.  Right.  You want Van Halen?  Play the album.  Don't put the singer in front of a microphone.  You ready for a douche chill?  We had some great comments about Mel Gibson yesterday.  Some terrific stuff.  Some great comedy.  Edgy comedy.  Michael Starr just ignored everything we said yesterday on the radio.  And he says, Jim Kerr commenting on what Mel Gibson was drinking before his alleged anti-Semitic rant.  The quote from Jim Kerr yesterday morning?  Here it is. 
[01:44:30]  It probably wasn't kosher.  That made the New York paper.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  What he was drinking was probably not kosher.  Jim Kerr should say that as he's queuing up a Zeppelin song and loading a shotgun.  At the same time.  With a toe trigger attachment.  To blast his awful brains all over the inside of the studio.  The line is so awful.  But Michael Starr thinks it's so terrific.  It has to be in the New York Post today.  Because Michael Starr is a douche. 
[01:45:00]  And by the way.  Way to play it safe, Michael.  Right next to Michael Starr is that awful mullet whore who I just hate.  Linda Stassi who destroyed Lucky Louie and said that it was really.  It's just not.  It's not the type of.  It's depressing.  For the new listeners.  Jimmy.  Our own Jimmy Norton who's on our show every day.  Every ding dong day.  I'm rich on Lucky Louie.  He's on Lucky Louie which is on 10 p.m.  10.30.  10.30.  I don't know.  I DVR everything.  My life is on DVR.  I'm not even here right now.  And she's. 
[01:45:30]  10.30 on HBO.  She trashed us.  She trashed us because she hated everything about it.  She hates the set.  She said it was so depressing.  And she didn't like the content.  And meanwhile this pig whose headshot.  She's a fat soccer mom face with a mullet.  And a cadaver hand resting on her cheek.  It's a hand three shades.  It looks like there's sunblock all over it.  She gave four stars to Secret Lives of Women.  Yes.  W.E. of course.  On tonight's show is Cutters.  An inside look at three young women who can't stop mutilating themselves with razors, knives and pushpins and nail files. 
[01:46:00]  Obviously they can stop.  They're not dead.  Absolutely.  Four stars for that but our show is depressing.  I hate your cadaver hand.  I'd like to sever it and slap you with it.  All right.  Listen.  Stupid unfunny hack writer.  What a horrific thing to have happen to you.  Someone severs your hand and then slaps you around with it.  Linda Stacey actually wrote about the Chappelle's.  Never really gave it thought until Jimmy brought it out to light like that.  They ball it up into a fist and then they throw it at your jaw.  Just punch you with your own severed hand. 
[01:46:30]  No I wouldn't punch her.  How annoying would that be?  I'd slap her and go this means war and I'd slap her like the cartoon gloves.  Like a duel.  Yeah.  Setting up for a duel.  Now she's handless so she can't really do much.  And she's a hack awful writer who thinks writing things about comedy like I had to fasten myself in with my seatbelt.  Did ya?  You should chop it off at the elbow so you can kind of get more of a bat kind of thing.  Like a bat?  Yeah.  I can't do the elbow.  Get that whiffle ball bat sound.  All I see is her David Cassidy hairdo and that white, this is not part of my body hand, daintily propping up her piggish, awful, erectile destroying face. 
[01:47:00]  He really hates her.  I hate, she has the sex appeal of prostate polyps.  Come on.  And I hope she's killed in a fire that somebody she loves started accidentally.  Come on, Jimmy.  You don't mean that.  I mean every word of it.  I say this without smile.  Wow.  I'd like to tie her down and make her listen to a whoopee show.  All right. 
[01:47:30]  Now you've gone too far.  I apologize for that.  I apologize.  Now you've just gone too far.  Now he needs to go to rehab.  Hey, with that, let's go to the phone.  We have a legend on the line here, Steve Dahl from Chicago.  We're being heard this morning on WCKG and we couldn't be happier.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hi, Steve.  Are you guys in a good mood or a bad mood?  Sorry you had to hear that.  This is our only mood.  This is it.  It's atrocious, isn't it?  All right.  I've been on hold for a while.  Yeah.  So can I go back?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:48:00]  Just a little bit?  Whatever you want to talk about.  Okay.  The cover of the post, that girl with the finger up, is helping him practice for his breathalyzer.  That's a good...  Because you've got to do the thing with the finger up.  He's following her finger with his eyes.  I didn't even realize that.  Look at that.  And then he's going to help her out with the blowing into the machine portion later in the evening.  Maybe that's why the other girl is so happy.  I don't know.  It's such a great story.  I would also say that Jim... 
[01:48:30]  Does Jim Crystal have a ponytail?  No, I think he finally cut the ponytail.  Okay.  Because I would have gone with Mad Max 2020.  Kind of a, you know, MD 20.  You know, Mogan David 2020.  Right.  It seems like that would have been a better joke to get in the post with.  It's just amazing.  They have to play it safe in the post.  I mean...  I got one for you guys.  Yeah.  It's kind of wine snobby.  Okay.  But he went, you know, he's in that group Opus Dei.  Yeah, yeah.  The hardcore Catholic.  I'm sure you're familiar with him.  Of course. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  He went from Opus Dei to Opus One.  Opus Dei.  Which, that's a fancy wine.  Maybe it's too much of a wine snobby.  Wow, that is the most wine snobby-est joke ever.  I know, I'm sorry.  You're talking to Meisterbrow and Michelob people.  Yeah.  You really are.  I don't drink it either.  I'm, you know...  You know, you're brilliant, though, because you did set it up saying it might be a little  wine snobby.  He knew he was talking to dopes.  Snobbery, right?  I like a nice Shiraz myself.  It's like a really good one of Mondavi wine, so...  I'm into a Shiraz, Steve.  He's doing a corporate gig in the Napa Valley next week. 
[01:49:30]  I know you guys only drink wine that comes in boxes.  Yes, they're handy.  A little tap on the front right in your fridge.  Your old box of wine.  You don't drink at all?  No, not anymore.  Me neither.  Not for like 11 years.  Oh, cool.  11 years.  Well, just think of the nice buzz you'd get right now if you started.  Imagine how drunk I was 12 years ago.  Exactly.  No one ever just goes, I got a little buzz and I decided, nah, I'm having a good time.  I don't want to do this anymore.  There's always an awful story.  Yeah, yeah.  I quit on June 24th, 1995. 
[01:50:00]  They always know a date, too.  June 23rd was hardcore.  I was driving the wrong way down the expressway.  Expressway.  Yeah.  What's the story, Steve?  I'm sorry?  What's the story that happened that made you say, enough of this buzz?  Oh, you know, I don't even know.  That's the trick.  You just didn't remember that whole day?  He was drinking wine by the jug.  I think I remember being all by myself in the basement, like, at four in the morning, you  know, with, like, my little kids upstairs sleeping, thinking, you know, I need to stop 
[01:50:30]  this.  And you realized you weren't in your house and don't have kids?  That's usually a problem.  And you realized he was the BK killer.  Nothing, like, you know, horribly bad happened, but I could tell that it was going to happen,  like, on the 24th or the 25th.  Well, you got something in common with our own Jim Norton.  Jim stopped at 17.  18, actually.  Was it 18 officially?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  February 1st of 87 was my first.  You know how many great buzzes you missed?  We tried to tell Jimmy, like, being drunk at 18 isn't a reason to go into rehab because 
[01:51:00]  that's just being drunk at 18.  You get hammered to the point where, you know, you pass out, you wake up in front of the toilet,  and he just, like, kind of set it clear for us that maybe it was wise.  Yeah, I was one of those awful after-school specials.  You know, where it's in the jeans, where the first time you taste it, like, let me have  a sip of that just to be silly.  The next thing you know, you're vomiting in a tent and someone told you you threatened  your friend with a box cutter.  And you're like, oh, that's not good. 
[01:51:30]  Well, hey, the good news is you still have some good stories.  Yeah, I know I wouldn't allow it.  Jimmy has some great stories.  What's the story walking down the street?  And who were you looking for?  I had a fight with my mother.  I was such a nerd.  And I'm walking down the street with a butcher knife.  I was hoping the police would shoot me.  I forgot they have nightsticks, so they probably should have hit my suburban, melodramatic arm  and smacked my fat face.  What the hell were you drinking?  Antifreeze?  Yeah.  I think it was actually Meisterbrow.  It was eight bucks a case back then.  More Meisterbrow we would drink if we had no money. 
[01:52:00]  You were one of those bastards that used to come over my house and come over with a six-pack  of Meisterbrow, put it in the fridge, and take the Heineken out of the fridge and start  drinking it.  And then, oh, what?  Hey, it's all important, man.  Don't worry about it.  It's the master's brew, dude.  I just reached in and grabbed one.  The foil on the top means it's expensive.  It's the master's brew.  The foil on the top.  Hey, Steve, so is it going to be tough to take out Eric and Kathy in Chicago? 
[01:52:30]  I know.  You guys are going to have to start taking some estrogen shots.  It's the only way we can compete.  Yeah.  We read the bios earlier, and we're just stunned by the humor in the bio alone.  I don't know how we're going to get past that.  It's very subtle humor, but it's...  Very subtle, indeed.  It's disguised as vomit-inducing trollery.  It's highbrow. 
[01:53:00]  You know, actually, I can't even imagine Norton drunk.  Listen to him sober.  Yeah, I know.  I imagine.  It was just...  I was an embarrassing ass.  It was never...  I was never like...  People are like, dude, I would like to party.  I was like...  What he just said, you're that guy.  That's exactly what I was.  I'm that guy.  I'm the annoying one at the party who would cry and cause a scene.  Oh.  I was a drunk crier.  Oh, it was awful.  The I love you, I hate you guy.  Oh, I was...  You're the best, man.  You're my bro.  We've been bros for so long, but why don't you...  You don't call as much as you used to, man. 
[01:53:30]  You don't even like me.  No, F-off.  Get out of here, man.  I hate you.  And the tirade leaves, and 20 minutes later, comes back to the party crying.  I'm sorry, man.  I love you.  You guys, I just...  Or I'm on the porch, waiting for the girl I like to come out and hug me.  Giving no effort to let her know you even like her.  I was just really gamey.  Like, one time, I would sweat a lot all over.  Upstairs, trying to nail your friend's mom.  Yeah.  She's been dead for two weeks.  I don't care.  I get the coffin lit open. 
[01:54:00]  My face in a satin pillow.  Yeah, you are trying to get her to make some kind of noise.  Hey, hold on.  Richard from St. Louis wants in on this.  Richard, what's up?  Hey, Professor Jimmy, who's the BK killer?  Wait, did I...  The Burger King killer?  Oh, wait.  What is his name?  Was it BTK?  Oh, BTK.  BTK.  BTK killer.  Yes.  The Mickey D's massacre.  It takes years, and it's done with cholesterol. 
[01:54:30]  Bunch of beheaded bodies were found with whoppers in their mouths.  God, do I suck.  Trying to improv.  Yuck.  Thank you very much, sir, for straighting me out and humiliating me in front of Steve,  who politely noticed and didn't say anything.  He's in the Hall of Fame and everything.  Got confused with the Wendy's Strangler.  Right.  Ass.  Well, Steve, we really appreciate your support.  Oh, hey, I'm glad to have you guys on.  I think it's going to be great.  Yeah, going to have fun, man.  We should have, in the last 67 months,  we could have just turned that thing off in the morning. 
[01:55:00]  It would have been better.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, we're in a pretty good position in Chicago.  Yeah, like, you literally can only go up.  Yeah.  Like, literally.  Some of the ratings were 0.0.  Yes.  Mr. Blutowski.  Right.  0.0.  I've never seen 0.0.  Nor is Mel Gibson, but seriously.  Hey, guys, good luck.  Hey, Steve, thank you so much.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, I'll talk to you soon.  See you, bro.  Bye.  Steve Dahl, legend. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  It's great that he's supporting us, too.  Chicago radio.  We like Steve.  We had lunch with him in New York, and he just made us laugh.  Had a blast.  He's got more stories that are just hysterical,  just from, you know, living the life, man.  All right.  Doing the radio.  We should know he quit drinking.  That one, we'll go back to that break.  What?  I just did, and goof on the way I said he was just living the life, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's all good.  And goof on it.  Hey, we got a fact that you just set up because you, like, had a moment, and you kind of meant 
[01:56:00]  it, like...  Yeah, I was kind of sincere.  Reminiscing.  Like, the guy's been in the business, you know, and he's still there, he's still doing  it.  When radio was radio, just...  And that would have just gone right by, unless Bill Burr pointed it out.  Good for you, Bill.  Are you catching that?  Scumbag Bill, as I like to call him.  I blocked it out, as I have a douche shelter, and my brain wouldn't accept those words from  somebody.  All right.  He really did.  You should have seen the awful sentimental look on his face.  At least Steve C. is backing me up.  That's terrible. 
[01:56:30]  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Anthony wants to hold up his lighter and put on Freebird.  Dreamy look in his eye.  Living the life, man.  Living the life.  Those were the days, my friend, where they...  Can we cut that out of the replay?  Yeah, please.  That's when you made thunder sounds with a cookie sheet.  Oh.  Yeah.  Galloping horses with half coconuts.  Hey, let's say hi to Ron in Jersey.  Ron?  Yes.  What's up?  Yeah.  I was just wondering for all the people in Chicago and San Francisco that don't know y'all, 
[01:57:00]  that y'all can get real crazy.  Like, one of my favorite ones was the Roya bus that y'all had in New York going to Giuliani's.  Yeah, we're going to have to explain that at another date.  Yeah, a lot of people in the new markets, if you don't get something, don't worry, you will.  Yeah, the phone call you heard while old Marks is on the phone will definitely make sense.  Yeah, the Ramon call, everything.  Don't worry, you'll get it because we drive things into the ground here on this show.  What you're finding new, maybe, and refreshing today is old hat. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yes.  All right, Ron, thanks.  We're mediocrity squared.  O.B. and Anthony Ross.  All right, Ron.  Thank you.  He's listening to us for the first time since being fired four years ago.  Wow.  He'll keep in.  He's the Roya bus.  Bastard.  He's missed a lot.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to continue with Bill Burr.  Bill, are you promoting something?  Yeah, Guildhall out in Long Island.  Where is Guildhall?  I grew up on Long Island.  I never heard of the joint.  It's the John Drew Theater at Guildhall. 
[01:58:00]  East Hampton, 158 Main Street.  East Hampton.  Oh, that's why.  Oh, you're out there.  We don't know East Hampton.  I'm going to see Bill Burr robin out in the Hamptons.  I've got to take three days off from my satellite radio gig.  I'm trying to hit a new market.  The Hamptons.  No, I'm trying to attract the people that Mel Gibson was trashing last night.  Oh, there you go.  When he was hammered.  Yeah.  So Friday.  Hang out in the Hamptons.  Wait, Friday you're going to be there, and then you're going to hit the road for our  gig up in Worcester.  All right, Friday, 8 p.m., the John Drew Theater at Guildhall in East Hampton with Bill Burr. 
[01:58:30]  Taking a ferry?  And then Saturday, I'm at Worcester, Boston.  With us.  Yeah, with you guys.  You taking a ferry?  Taking a ferry.  Oh, yeah.  You don't know that.  Am I supposed to play along?  Are you taking a ferry, or are you driving back into New York, around, and then up to  Boston?  Stay in East Hampton, and then take the ferry across.  You take the ferry across.  From Orient Point.  From Orient Point.  From Orient Point.  This ferry doesn't exist.  No, it does.  No, it does. 
[01:59:00]  Holy crap.  It's a ferry.  That would be a great joke.  Yeah, just get that.  And he's sitting there at Orient Point.  Yeah, on a dock while two people are fishing.  Where's the ferry?  They got him with a ferry joke.  We really, we got to take a break.  Yeah, we got a break.  They're killing us here.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hi, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Hey, folks.  My name is Henry Rowland.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to Pot Talk.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I love this. 
[01:59:30]  Please refrain from the word.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right.  My acid reflux is bugging me.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got a very, very busy week.  We got Bill Burr in studio today.  We're pumping the ONA Traveling Virus.  We're going to be in Worcester this weekend, August 5th, DCU Center.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.com.  If you want to see the lineups and all that and you need more info, go to opiananthony.com. 
[02:00:00]  The important thing, though, tickets still available.  And when we broadcast live Friday from WBCN, I think, I do believe, we'll have to get Dave  Wellington on the air tomorrow.  The first 104 listeners to show up outside WBCN will get free tickets to the ONA Traveling  Virus.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  I didn't take my medicine this morning.  What medicine?  I take my stupid acid reflux medicine, my NXIVM.  I think I'm getting strep throat, too, so my apologies in advance. 
[02:00:30]  We got to travel.  Oh, boy.  You're not going to get strep throat.  What is acid reflux?  You just sort of throw up every couple of minutes?  No, it's not that bad.  It's a sort of throw up.  Yeah, you feel it come to the back of your throat and then you're done.  Instead of dying like, you know, Jimmy Hedrickson, your own vomit, you just sort of pass.  You faint.  Oop.  You faint.  You come back up.  Oh, I got the vapors.  No, I take, uh...  I take next to him and it helps that.  It's like when you have that, like, awful lesson. 
[02:01:00]  Good boy.  All right.  No, no, this is like an old person thing, though, isn't it?  Health break with Jim Norton.  Hold on.  We got to get Brother Joe a plug here.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course.  Joe, what's up?  Got to make it quick.  We're running out of time, but, uh...  Uh-oh.  I don't know if I'm capable of doing that.  We're on WB11 Channel 11 in New York.  It's going to be live on Friday.  If we get voted for it, all you have to do is to log on to WB.  I have no idea what you're doing.  Is it a contest?  Yeah, it's a contest.  It's four tribute bands to, uh... 
[02:01:30]  Oh, tribute bands?  All right.  So far, we got tribute bands.  You're going to be on Friday or today?  Today.  Now.  Right now.  Like...  In like two minutes.  Gene Simmons is there, too.  I'm recording it.  Now Gene Simmons is...  All right.  Here's the deal.  I'll help out, Brother Joe.  Yeah.  Brother Joe's tribute band, his U2 tribute band, will be on the WB11 news in, like, seconds at  this point.  Uh-huh.  We'll replay your appearance over at XM when we continue the Opie and Anthony show.  Cool.  And you've got to go to WB11.com to vote.  So the pests have a mission today. 
[02:02:00]  Yep.  Vote for Brother Joe's band.  You are a professional, Opie.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  Have a good set.  We'll talk to you...  Call us after the set.  Tell us how it went.  Sounds good, man.  All right.  We're trying to rush through a million things here.  I know.  We're running out of time.  Battle of the tribute band.  She's queuing it up right now.  Oh, there it goes.  Yeah.  We'll get the audio.  Look at that.  Poor Joe needs another drummer.  His, like, blew a head gasket.  I know.  We'll get that story from Joe, and we'll play this audio that we're sort of watching in 
[02:02:30]  the background over at XM, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Fox 5 Future News.  Sam found this.  Where's Sam?  Where's Sam?  Sam.  Sam.  Where is Sam?  Here comes Sam.  And, unfortunately, he enters the studio over here at Free FM, so we have to play the clean  version of his theme song that Dave from New Jersey did.  Come on.  All right.  All right.  Sam's not black. 
[02:03:00]  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thumb.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm, white or a mm-mm, yeah, we're teasing, we know, cause he's 
[02:03:30]  white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  And what bugs me about Sam's hair is that it looks like a fancy toilet seat cover.  Yeah.  Like a lamb's wool.  That's wonderful.  He got a haircut recently, too.  Yeah.  So it's not as fro-y. 
[02:04:00]  It's a short, cropped afro.  Yeah, cause he doesn't want us goofing on it anymore.  Give me a couple weeks.  All right.  Eddie Haskell.  We're really running out of show here.  So, Sam, what'd you bring in here for us to goof on?  For some reason this morning on the Fox 5 News, they decided it'd be a good idea to  send their reporter out claiming it was February 2007.  They're sending us six months into the future.  All right.  Oh, that's cute.  How's everyone doing?  Did they do any news from that or just the weather?  If you're going six months in the future, wouldn't you, like, maybe do the news? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, I want to see how this Middle East thing turns out.  What's on KTU in the morning?  They started off with a little news.  They started off with a little bit of news.  A little bit of news?  Yeah.  Six months into the future.  Great.  God damn, Timmy.  World War III has begun, and they're doing this cute little bit.  Yeah.  So, I hear, I think this is what Anthony was taking a look at.  The weather guy was dressed in, like, winter crap.  They dressed the weather guy out in a big coat.  A big parka.  Oh, that must have been hilarious.  Oh, just hysterical.  The news these days. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, it's just so funny.  The worst computer-animated snowflakes coming down in front of the screen.  Yeah.  That you've ever seen.  All right.  Here we go.  Well, you know, we travel everywhere on this show.  Miami, Chicago, Israel.  But we're also traveling not just in space, but in time.  Time travel.  Yes.  We're going to take you, the viewer, six months into the future.  It's February 1st of 07.  The Yankees and the Mets battled it out in the World Series. 
[02:05:30]  Shut up.  He is anticipating the blizzard of 07, which is on its way, right, Mark?  Yeah, that was a great World Series Yankees.  Hello.  Nice.  And the Yankees won it.  We heard it.  What's that?  No, it wasn't the Red Sox.  It was the Subway Series, man.  It was a beautiful thing.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  This is the news.  That was just getting good.  Yeah, it wasn't like the riffing on the games. 
[02:06:00]  What happened?  Who played?  Oh, wow.  Yankees, Mets, and the World Series.  And during that, he was in a parka, and it was...  Earmuffs.  Yeah.  It was fake snowing.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just improv'd something and said,  yes, Hezbollah nuked Israel, thank God.  Now, next, the weather just snapped.  The Mel Gibson-backed Hezbollah.  Wow.  Yeah.  The race war had started.  Yes.  Did?  And Sam just tapped in and out of both sides successfully.  Nobody knew what he was.  He could cross enemy lines. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, how you doing, Sam?  All right, hold on.  People are saying it was really loud on XM, but low on the...  Oh, interesting.  All right, we'll turn down the volume.  Here's the second clip.  The news from the future.  Bundle up.  Mother Nature is about to unleash winter wrath upon the city of New York here in February of 2007.  In fact, we are expecting that this storm will move in late tonight.  You've got to get ready.  There's going to be a winter wonderland, and by this time tomorrow morning, as you know, 
[02:07:00]  everywhere you look, there will be the white stuff.  It's time to get ready right now.  Oh, boy.  Wow, and another news here in February of 2007, Suri Cruz got her first, her Pete Rose haircut.  I think Sam might have screwed up for the first time.  Well, what happened?  The instant feedback, can't hear it.  Great.  One channel? 
[02:07:30]  I don't know what's going on.  The XMers can't hear the audio.  How about this?  Well, consider themselves lucky.  The audio stinks.  Sam?  Good one.  I would punch you in the eye, but I don't know what color would show up.  The orange and yellow frightens me.  Wow.  You blew it.  That was awful.  Let me do a little fast-forward news from the future.  Yeah.  Remember Sam?  You're fire.  Remember that mistake he made?  Yeah.  That new guy we got that replaced him, he doesn't make mistakes. 
[02:08:00]  I'll try to correct it.  Something is going on.  It's not worth playing.  No.  Someone's saying you can barely hear it on FM.  The XMers are saying you can't hear anything.  Other people are saying it's really loud.  So I don't know.  Great.  I don't know what to believe.  I could barely hear it.  Obviously something's going on with that.  I don't like when you think you look smarter in glasses.  You don't.  That's great.  This is how we end?  Good one.  Welcome.  Welcome. 
[02:08:30]  Our first day on in Chicago and San Francisco.  And what amounts to an intern has screwed up the finale of the show.  An intern with a toilet seat cover on his skull has wrecked everything.  We don't know if he's black or white.  That's right.  Old bath mat hair.  This is what we do.  Someone requested the Tourette's Whorehouse bit.  Oh, you're doing in case of emergency break glass.  And we did say that.  We said that during the break.  We'll admit it.  We have nothing.  We don't have enough time to get into anything good.  So we're going to play this old thing that's been hurt a million times. 
[02:09:00]  The Tourette's Whorehouse bit from our CD that came out years and years ago.  Enjoy this Chicago and San Francisco.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow if you're not joining us on XM Satellite Radio.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  I got your pleasure menu. 
[02:09:30]  Could you hold on a minute?  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's Syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start. 
[02:10:00]  And then from there, the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay. 
[02:10:30]  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take the fees, the fees, the fees, the fees, a mess card? 
[02:11:00]  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's worth your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe? 
[02:11:30]  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever.  Do you have any...  Girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[02:12:00]  But wait...  Opie and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  Goddamn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags. 
[02:12:30]  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  Opie and Anthony.  Scared.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Hey, coming up on the second half of the show.  Well, I don't know if I should say it the way I was going to say it now.  Why?  It might give something away.  A little suspense.  Let me think.  Well, we're going to do serious questions only today.  Okay.  Very serious subject that we're going to be covering in the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah.  And we want our listeners to take it very seriously. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  With that, let's walk.  There we go.  There's a couple of people out here.  Huh?  Sounds like a breast cancer segment.  No.  No.  Bill Burr was just reminding me that the last time he did the walk over with us, all hell broke loose.  Oh, that was the last.  Wow.  Maybe.  Yeah, that was the time.  I didn't get the microphone, so I said, you know what, I don't think anything's going to happen. 
[02:14:00]  You went ahead.  I walked ahead.  And missed everything.  Went up the elevator, and when I came out of the elevator, I just heard Opie screaming.  What are you going to say now, fucker?  Yeah.  All right.  We remember that one.  All right.  He's got a ninja just on his face.  Ninja.  Opie's taunting him.  Yeah.  I was real brave.  I know.  When are we going to get a stripper to hand out these stupid stickers so people at least look?  I know.  They don't look. 
[02:14:30]  I know.  They're immune to anything.  Here.  Hot enough for you?  Hot enough for you, sir?  Ma'am?  Hot enough for you?  BJ Singh with that awful fucking...  Oh, that's crazy.  We got to do a segment on the heat.  Yeah, the heat.  What are you doing to plan?  Uh, I'm going into my air-conditioned office, you fucking idiot.  How are you keeping cool today?  How are you keeping cool today, sir?  How are you keeping...  He's not doing any math.  He's not...  Yeah, he's not doing interviews. 
[02:15:00]  Fucker.  He's Asian.  Wow.  I thought my legs went white.  It ain't whitey.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  If you had gray hair like that, would you wear white?  She's got to be hot.  He's wearing white...  He looks like a towel.  Yeah, white pants, white shirt.  Looked like a towel.  You'd mix up the colors a little bit, wouldn't you?  I wouldn't know.  We love Snapple.  Are you bringing extra juice, sir, because of the heat?  All right, Snapple guy.  Cool down some people. 
[02:15:30]  Is that Connie Chunk?  Nice, sir.  Wow.  Stand up straight, will you?  Did you see that old guy?  He was feeling whatever was going to kill him in about 20 minutes.  That was a look on his face.  Holy shit.  Oh, look at dog shit.  Ah, don't step in that.  Melted.  It's so hot, the shit is becoming nougat.  Caramel.  Three musketeer filling.  Caramel filling.  That's horrible. 
[02:16:00]  It's really stifling out today.  You guys scared Frederick Douglass away?  I saw him the other day on 7th Avenue.  He occasionally still shows up.  Sits on the standpipe.  A mob of angry white people.  Surrounding a black homeless guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, how could good come up that every time?  We give him money.  Yeah, it looked really bad.  Just from a distance.  I saw a look of concern.  No one kicking him, though.  Other members of his community.  Doc Martens or anything. 
[02:16:30]  You know what really looks like he's at an Aryan fucking rally, doesn't he?  Skin head.  Shaved head.  The acid reflux.  Trying to decide whether or not I should attack Sam.  I can't tell.  A lot of Aryans have that acid reflux there, Bill.  Oh, yeah, they do.  You know about that in history?  Sitting there chewing.  That's all the hatred.  All that Wiener schnitzel.  That's all the hatred.  Oh, it's the hatred backing up.  Yeah.  Wow.  There's a girl in a little white, a cool cottony dress. 
[02:17:00]  Virginal.  What was I call it?  A rape me outfit.  Oh, her?  She probably has a rape fantasy.  There's the fucking missing arm chick.  What's that?  Slot machine lady.  It was just too hot to even do anything on the street today.  Yeah.  That's all we give these people.  I'm sorry.  It's more than they deserve.  Thanks.  I'm with Jimmy.  Thanks, guys.  Getting to the air conditioning.  That's all you get today.  For fancy people that need AC. 
[02:17:30]  Their backs are still sweating from driving all the way in waiting to see something.  Something happened and they got nothing.  See that guy smoking a cigarette?  How can you do that on a day like today?  I had a fire in your mouth.  That's what I want when it's 9,000 degrees.  Fire in your mouth.  All right.  We'll sit upstairs.  Sign up.  That sucks. 
[02:18:00]  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:18:30]  The virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bath!  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:19:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:20:00]  O and A.  Mark 2.  XM Satellite Radio.  I made the last elevator up.  I fit in.  Everyone was waiting for the second one.  I said, fuck that noise.  I'm going up.  And Jimmy jumped on at the last minute and started making horrific, gurgling, snot-sucking sounds  in a crowded elevator, and one of the women actually quietly went, are you okay? 
[02:20:30]  And he didn't answer.  He's just going, making noises in the elevator.  Just like sick noises.  So now all those people are going to be completely paranoid that they're going to get some kind  of pneumonia.  Are you sure that was Jimmy?  That doesn't sound like something he'd do.  No, nothing he'd do in an elevator.  Such a social butterfly.  He's a complete ass.  I love him in the elevator.  He's just horrible.  It's either like loud, sexually explicit talk, or my favorite is when he talks loudly to nobody 
[02:21:00]  that his girlfriend's pregnant and he's got a kicker in the stomach in a crowded elevator.  That's one of my favorites.  One of the worst ones, I won't even acknowledge that that song just played in my head.  One of the worst ones is when he plays homo with you.  When he'll start rubbing your back in the elevator and going, it's okay, baby.  I'm so sorry about last night.  And you go like, get away from me. 
[02:21:30]  And he makes it look like you're having a spat, a lover's spat.  And in a couple of floors, you can't really explain to the people that, you know, he's a con.  Let me start.  A couple of years back, see, he's a comedian.  And we took, oh, okay.  This is all part of his shtick.  Yeah, it's just his shtick.  Oh, this is good.  I got a letter.  Wake up, Anthony.  Usually you know what's going on, but you don't have a fucking clue about Israel.  Oh, this.  All right, Bob Collins. 
[02:22:00]  I don't have a clue, and I could give a flying fuck.  Oh, this is about Israel.  Everyone's bombing everybody.  It's World War III, the beginning of it.  Well, let me read this letter, Anthony, for you.  Wait until Syria gets involved.  Wake up, Anthony.  Usually you know what's going on, but you don't have a fucking clue about Israel.  Don't forget who's occupying whose land illegally.  According to the UN international law, the Geneva Conventions, and even the U.S.  before that Israeli tool Bush 2 got in.  The entire world votes against Israel at the UN, except for the U.S. 
[02:22:30]  Israel and the fucking Marshall Islands.  Get wise to being used just like Bush, Anthony.  All of Europe knows that the U.S. is totally manipulated by Israel through a dumbass president.  We're a laughing stock because of people like you who don't pay attention.  Don't go just by your nice, quiet new neighbors.  You were totally manipulated Friday by Voss and that super Jew jerk from Disturb.  Was he super Jew? 
[02:23:00]  I only know him as jerk from Disturb, and he's got this super, he's super Jew.  This is why Bob Collins is so dumb.  A, he addressed one to me, and then he just gave the same one as Anthony.  So don't send me a note that you meet for Anthony, you dope.  And me.  The whole staff.  And also, it's not just Bush, it's also Reagan and every other stupid president.  That has supported Israel because it's the last bastion of freedom over there.  And I like how they think they're being manipulated.  It's not, we're using them too. 
[02:23:30]  Of course.  Very smart, Billy.  And Bob.  Yeah, you know what?  I think that's the first time we have ever agreed on anything to let him.  Can I continue with the letter, please?  All right.  How would you feel if Mexico occupied your neighborhood for nearly 40 years, provoked you  at every opportunity, and then grabbed more of your neighborhood when you protested?  They do!  Claiming they're the victims.  Holy shit, you know something?  The Mexicans, the illegals, are a lot like Hezbollah to Israel.  But they're not using rockets.  They use, like, those packs they put on their back to trim the fucking sidewalk. 
[02:24:00]  That's their weapon of choice.  They're fucking landscapers.  But the fact of the matter is, yeah, it would be.  If we could build a buffer zone against Mexico, it would kind of be a little similar.  I think you brought up a good point there, whatever your name is there, Bob.  All right.  Grab more of your neighborhood when you protested, claiming they're the victims.  Or tore down your house just because they claim to think you might be related to a terrorist. 
[02:24:30]  They do this often.  They do this so often that it's laughable to everyone who pays attention.  I'll tell you, Bob, the reason they do do that is because people were suicide bombing,  so their families got money, so this was kind of a deterrent.  Because once a suicide bomber is dead, he's dead, so this was a way of stopping them from doing it.  They figure if the house got torn down, then they wouldn't do it because their families would have a place to live.  They obviously don't give a shit about their own lives.  Anthony, would you like to continue with your letter there?  Where are we?  Ariel.  Ariel Sharon started the latest intifada after a long, peaceful period by shocking even the U.S. and Venice. 
[02:25:00]  How about he started it when soldiers were kidnapped?  I think he means before this, probably in 2000.  Oh, I think, well, but they gave back land in the Gaza Strip.  Like, they were trying to do something.  I don't know.  We should just let them duke it out.  I think everybody involved in this situation would love if nobody else got killed, their families, things like that. 
[02:25:30]  But there's just this hatred of Israel and the Jews, and the Jews have this hatred of the Palestinians,  because they want to kill each other over religious homelands and fucking shit that goes back thousands of years.  That ain't going to get settled until one side completely eliminates the other.  The bottom line, we have to step out of it.  Right.  Just let them duke it out.  We could support one guy.  Look at what we did.  Hey, stupid fucking Bob Collins.  What do you think the whole Cold War was based on? 
[02:26:00]  People using other countries, countries being manipulated, presidents being manipulated to keep, uh, manipulated?  Yeah.  I sound like Kawana Brawley there.  No one nips, nips, me or my family.  But it's been about that forever.  This guy's a jerk-off.  What do you think?  This is something new?  You're a dummy.  Boy, you're turning us on to new info, Bob.  And by the way, uh, every time, every time peace is almost achieved, radical, uh, groups, because without, without, uh, conflict, they don't function. 
[02:26:30]  Hamas is irrelevant.  Hezbollah is irrelevant without any kind of fucking, uh, uh, attention.  So is Al-Qaeda.  Why do you think they're destroying their own fucking infrastructure?  They're attacking other Muslims, you dope.  And you know what else, Bob?  Bob, Israel, and the Jews haven't come over and blown us up.  Yep.  And they're not killing our fucking, uh, people by blowing up embassies.  Yeah.  And driving fucking boats into our, uh, naval ships.  It's not the Israelis doing it, okay? 
[02:27:00]  It's the other side.  So who the fuck are we supposed to support, asshole?  And they haven't gotten onto a bus with a bomb strapped to them either, you shithead.  We got a rocket scientist on the line here.  Denise, what's up?  Hey, uh, hey, guys, uh, Professor Anthony, um,  I agree with your point, but I do want to point out that  Ariel Sharon didn't do this because of a couple of shoulders.  He's kind of had a stroke.  Yes, that's what I said in 2000.  Yeah, that's what I said.  He's kind of in a coma.  I tried to make that point, miss.  Oh, well, thank you, Jimmy. 
[02:27:30]  I agree.  That's why she's called a rocket scientist.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this guy's got me in a tizzy.  Knowing you, Anthony, you would be a terrorist, too,  if somebody fucked with your life every goddamn day.  Let me see.  Look at some of the Sundance and IFC docus on how arrogant Israel soldiers get off on  harassing civilians for hours every day at checkpoints, in parentheses.  Get wise to this, Anthony, like you're wise to everything else.  Don't be such a fucking myopic.  Love your show.  Don't be so fucking myopic. 
[02:28:00]  Love your show.  Can't say my name or I'll be blacklisted for life by your friends.  P.S.  Every other U.S. pundit, anchor, reporter, columnist, or news exec is Jewish.  So that's why everything in the U.S. media is titled Israel's way,  except for token stilted balance.  What?  Stilted.  Stilted balance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They really should identify where they're coming from, but they seldom do.  This isn't the case everywhere in the world.  That's why the world thinks what it thinks, 
[02:28:30]  and the sheep-like people in the U.S. think what they think.  Oh, because the Jews run the media.  Well, like, what?  You don't think I fucking go to Al Jazeera?  You don't think I watch Al Jazeera?  I watch Al Jazeera.  I know what goes on.  It's a wonderful program.  I know what their fucking side of it is, too.  They're actually some very funny shows.  Hysterical shows.  You can't fucking listen to two seconds of Al Jazeera  without them evoking God and fucking, yeah, Allah coming,  and they're predestined to own the whole fucking Middle East, 
[02:29:00]  and we suck, and fuck you.  It's like the Middle Eastern 700 Club.  Exactly, yeah.  Watch the 700 Club here.  They're as rational as those fucking people are.  Bunch of kooks.  Shut up.  There you go.  There's the letter.  Bob Collins.  Bob Collins is an ass.  You didn't give your name, but you put your return address label on the fucking thing  with your address on it.  Be nice, or the pest will get it.  He gave his name.  You'll be knocking on your fucking door.  All right, here we go. 
[02:29:30]  Moving on to other things.  I want to thank Bill Burr for wrecking a perfect show.  Oh.  Bill fucking Burr.  I knew it.  He said it.  Bill fucking Burr.  I knew it.  It had to happen.  Bill had to do it.  There's a bunch of pansies sitting over there, not cursing.  Let's not even give the...  We're sellouts, man.  Let's not even give...  I've got to bring a little swagger to the show.  You know something, Bill?  I'm not even going to give the context of it.  I'm just going to give what they dumped out.  I'd still blow them. 
[02:30:00]  That's what you said on the show that got dumped.  That's what prevented us from having a perfect show.  Bill Burr's saying I'd still blow him.  I have a thank you to give, too, by the way, here on the XM program.  Oh.  I've got to go to rehab.  Yes, Jimmy.  It's RGF 2006.  I don't know what your name is, but I got...  Look what I got.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, look.  It's got to be Ozzy or Sabbath.  It's a record, and it's called Stories and Songs About Fire Engines. 
[02:30:30]  Fire Engines, and I bet I know what song is on that.  Norton, I found the song you've been trying to remember on the show,  dot, dot, dot, Where's the Fire, Where's the Fire?  The song is The Little Boy Who Cried Fire by Steve Saline.  The album is Stories and Songs About Fire Engines from 1969,  and he ripped the song.  We started to play this on Free FM and didn't.  I would prefer to have done it on XM. 
[02:31:00]  A, because we can go longer here without commercials,  and B, I just like XM.  And with that said, I just want to know, it's from what year?  1969.  About fire engines.  Do they talk about hosing down black people?  They don't mention that.  I imagine there's another one called Ways to Get Them to Learn Their Place,  but they don't actually say who, but you kind of get the...  Right.  And this is a little boy.  I would hear this song, and I remembered the chorus.  I'm 38 now, so this is, you know, 30, 33 years ago, 
[02:31:30]  that I would listen to this and remember it.  And I was like, what song is that?  And I mention it on the air, and we get two copies of it,  and a copy of the actual album.  Well, we got a little taste.  You want to hear it, Jimmy?  I have to.  It'll bring back some memories.  I've heard it recently, and I realize, wow, I remember this well,  except the fire engine sound is horrendous.  Here we go.  Where's the fire?  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire,  fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

[02:33:30]  were so exciting  that he wanted to see them again  so he took his little teddy bear  and ran down in the street  and waved his arms  pretending the teddy bear was on fire  I'm on fire  I'm on fire  stop this  put this out  it's ridiculous  I don't know what's happening  but I smell like Ben Gay  and I'm 36  and I shouldn't  why have you  set me on fire  hey fire  you're in my  motherfucking house  hey the phone's  going nuts  Chris in Pennsylvania

[02:35:30]  to his head  that's true about Steve  now the fire's on his feet  I can even feel the heat  oh you haven't got a minute  to spare  there's a fire on his nose  and it's dripping on his toes  now it's reaching for his eye  and ear  I'm a homo  and now I'm losing weight  and I can't figure out why  I think I got the age  there's a fire in my rear  saying all the engines will soon be here  I need that in my machine too  I purposely crash into this fire truck 
[02:36:00]  just so it doesn't get to the fire  this actually sounds like Steve  in a pair of panties  running around the house  traipsing  the noise he makes  as he daily traipses  where's the fire cried the fireman  there's a fire on his feet  there's a fire around his neck  there's a fire creeping up his head  now the fire's on his feet  I can even feel the heat  oh you haven't got a minute to spare  there's a fire on his nose  and a stick on his nose  now it's reaching for his eye 
[02:36:30]  and he  oh boy  is this like about some guy  who's like  like a gay guy  who's like cock teasing people  that's terrible  I'm sorry  what are you doing in my house  sorry  sorry  it's okay  this song is six minutes long  we've cut some of it out  well we got one more segment to play 
[02:37:00]  I hope so  how many times did you play this  before I was a kid  yeah before your parents  just fucking choked you  probably 8,000  on my little record player  I would pretend I was singing it  where's the fire  I was a little boy  what an awful song  were you doing both harmonies  yeah where'd you find this  I have no recollection  did you like  that's pretty good  you've never heard this before  never heard this before  it's a fucking toe tapper though  I'm wondering how many people  had this album  and later on in life  like to be pissed on  hey wow  there's a fire on my chest  there's a fire all over  there's apparently a fire 
[02:37:30]  in my throat  there's plastic in my tub  where's the copy  where's the copy  where's the copy  where  where's the tranny  where's the tranny  hi big daddy  hi big daddy  as you have the tranny  where  where's the fire  where's the fire  oh there's a fire on her wig  there's a fire on her tuck back  I hate my hoes  I hate my hoes  And I want to go to Brazil and get it taken off 
[02:38:00]  Here's the last segment of the song  Not very long after this  The little boy was playing on the street corner  When he looked up and saw  Monster Rain  His own house really was on fire  Oh no  He ran down to the corner  And pulled the alarm  And waited  And waited  But nobody came  It's happening  This time it's really true 
[02:38:30]  My house is burning to the ground  In flames of orange and blue  The alarm was still ringing  But there was no sign of the engines  And very soon there was nothing left of his house  But black rubble and smoke  And dead parents  This is where they would scare the shit out of you  With the lessons back in the day  Somebody died  Someone died  Where's my daddy?  Where's my mom?  I fucking burned them down 
[02:39:00]  As now you go  Everybody runs the race  And everybody gets a ribbon nowadays  Yeah  Let me tell you something  Back in the day  No more scaring the shit out of the kids  He learned his lesson that boy  He bet you he never lit another fire  And it's funny  Steve got an email from my friend  Who was a little fire bug  My friend Jerry sent me an email  About setting a fire  And I would like  Steve has it  Yeah  Let's get back  This is Jerry  He's a childhood friend of mine  From when I was  Not this young  But probably like 
[02:39:30]  Eight years old  And I got an email from him recently  I guess through MySpace or whatever  Because maybe he listens to O&A  An apology from him?  You were so tussleable  You couldn't resist?  Now the email's creepy right?  No no no  It's funny  It's actually  I would like to know where it is  Alright they're getting it right now  Let's finish up the song here  20 more seconds  Thank god  Grubble and smoke  The little boy was very sorry  That he had called the fire engines  All those other times  When he hadn't needed them at all  That's best  I'll never tell another lie 
[02:40:00]  For lies can sometimes stick  And when you tell the truth  They think it's just another trick  Dick  And that is the story  Of the little boy  Oh no  Can you imagine the producers  When they're recording this  After one thing  Steve do you know what I'm talking about?  I think we got it  We got it  That was great  But I missed a part  Nah you nailed it  We'll fix it in the mix  Maybe it was Stan or Danny  But I sent it to somebody  Somebody had an email from me  It was a printed out email  I think we had it in studio  Yes we absolutely did 
[02:40:30]  We just didn't get to it  Yeah  So someone had it  Alright we'll figure it out Jimmy  Okay  We'll get it on  Alright why don't we take our first break  And regroup  Is the doctor calling in next?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Doctor who is this guy?  Charles Kimmelman  He's a doctor who deals with sleep apnea  Alright  And I have some questions about that  Yeah well he's on the phone  Could he wait through a little break?  Yeah  Alright we'll take a little break  Mo Gibson's the hot story obviously 
[02:41:00]  And Jay Leno had some fun with that  With that last night on his fine TV show  As you may have heard  There is now a 48 hour ceasefire  Going on in the Middle East  Israel will stop attacking Hezbollah  But Hezbollah will not necessarily agree  To stop attacking Israel  Hey  We can't even get Mel Gibson  To stop attacking Israel  So it's very hard  It's very hard  Oh boy  Man  I guess you all heard that story  Mel Gibson arrested in Malibu 
[02:41:30]  On a DUI  I don't know what he was drinking  I think he would rule out Manischewitz  Well this is a horrible story  The L.A. sheriff in his report said that Mel made anti-Semitic remarks  Given how much trouble he's in  Today he hired the law firm of Goldfarb, Weinstein, and Cohen  I'm not sure what that means  No the sheriff said Mel's blood alcohol was a .12  .12  Whoa  Yeah yeah yeah 
[02:42:00]  Given how high that is  Half a point higher  He would officially be a Kennedy  Do you know that?  Yeah  Exactly  Exactly  Yeah yeah  Yeah they said  They said on the news  If convicted  He could face up to 14 days in the Thunderdome  Yeah I know  Thunderdome  Thunderdome  And here's the really sad part  You know who was in the car with him at the time  Do you know?  No man  Britney Spears' baby  Oh God 
[02:42:30]  That poor kid  Yeah  Yeah I don't know what Mel Gibson's next Hollywood project will be  I think we rule out Fiddler on the roof  Yeah I think that's out  I just ate four burritos  And drank a pot of coffee  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh God damn  The O.D.M. Anthony Show  Oh God  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show 
[02:43:00]  Still to come  Brother Joe  Who's just on the WB11 News  Here in New York City  With his tribute band  We got the audio  We'll get Brother Joe on the phone  To see how it went  And more soap opera  More soap opera shit going on  With his U2 tribute band 
[02:43:30]  To you  The story you told in the office yesterday  Was really funny  Oh my dear sweet Jesus  The guy actually said  Now I'm gonna go out there  And fuck up the gig  Yeah  Yeah  It's classic spinal tap  Joe just needs now  It was a singer  He had to replace  Because his voice went  That's it right  The original singer's voice  Just went  He was a great Bono  He looked the part  And everything  Something you know  I guess you play enough  Or you sing it every night almost 
[02:44:00]  And his voice went  So he got a new one  And the new guy I hear  Is really good  Yeah  Okay  And then his drummer  Self-destructed  From what I hear  I wasn't at the gig  Master Poe was there  Gentlemen  And apparently  There was a bit of a  Problem  Between my brother  And the drummer  Allegedly  As my brother tells it  The drummer was  Sauced  And got belligerent  With Joe 
[02:44:30]  And started like  Cursing him out  In the middle of the place  Just cursing him out  During the gig  Saying shit like  Yeah listen to this  Why don't you just  Sap off your brother's fame  You cunt  Wow  Like shit like that  Like just out of nowhere  Just drunk  So it was like a point  Counterpoint kind of thing  Yeah like that  Very civil  Like in front of a gig  And Joe is just like  Gotta get through this gig  Just gotta get through  The fucking gig  That's all he cares about  He'll deal with the drummer  After the gig  Yeah business  Not getting himself  And then the guy's  Wow that's a pro 
[02:45:00]  And then Poe walked over  And he points at Poe  And this guy's like  A little skinny guy  Points at Poe  And goes  Oh what  You brought your  Fucking back up  He goes  I'm not scared of you  And points at Poe  Oh that's good  And Poe would just like  Forget about it  Like snap him  With not even an effort  Not even knowing he did  He would kill you  And not leave a mark  Yeah  Not even know  Twist him into a balloon animal  That was it  There you go  And then yeah  The kicker was when 
[02:45:30]  When he was just like  Yelling at Joe  And getting in his face  And he goes  You know what I'm gonna do  I'm gonna fuck the gig up then  I ain't gonna even  Fucking play  So he gets up on stage  Sits down  They go to start a song  And the guy  Starts doing a rendition  Worse than Jimmy's  Version  He just started  Fucking the drum part  Back in the New York groove  Look man  I fully support  Brother Joe  You know that  But that's hilarious  It is hysterical 
[02:46:00]  It's hilarious  When he's telling me this  He goes  Look I'm pissed off  Trust me  You know  But to hear that  The guy goes  And now I'm gonna  Fuck up the gig  And then in front of  A sold out crowd  He's up there  Just playing  Smashing cymbals  And drums  Not keeping time  To the music  And as Joe's  Telling me this  I'm saying  I go  Joe  You know  So he goes  So we need a new drummer  So if you can get  The word out  I go  That's fine  I go  But you know  This is a fucking  Hysterical bit  This is a hysterical story  So do you have the audio  Of this guy  Do we have the audio 
[02:46:30]  I'm asking  I don't know  I don't know  If they tape  Joe tapes at all the shows  I would assume  If it was taped  We'd have it  Because he's just up there  Drunk going  Fuck you  Fuck you  You motherfucker  Did they get through the game  They must have played  Like a couple of songs  I don't know  We'll find out  From Brother Joe  In a little while  Yeah  Find out what happened there  So  That's just  That's funny and sad  At the same time  Obviously  Opantoo's down  Than  Why don't you get on that  Opantoo down  But the drummer's  Definitely gone 
[02:47:00]  Right  Yeah  Yeah  That's it  Hey  Why don't we talk to  Charles  Dr. Charles  Kimmelman  Oh  He is an acclaimed  And board certified  Otolaryngologist  Oh boy  What's  Otolaryngologist  You really know  How to pronounce that  Yes I do  We'll let the doctor  Do it first  No he doesn't  Dr. Charles P  Kimmelman  Yes  Welcome aboard doc  Hello sir  How do you pronounce  That very long word 
[02:47:30]  Otolaryngology  That's what I thought  Alright  Otolaryngology  Ear, nose and throat  Ear, nose and throat  Now do you do  You think all those things  Would be connected  For one guy to work on  All three  Why all three  Well because they are connected  Wow  You're very  Very insightful  Wait I have  I have a question here  Is he going to say  You station tube  At some point in this  I have a feeling  Serious questions  Are going to start shortly  Are you located in New York  I am  Are you  Like I have very bad 
[02:48:00]  I have very bad sinuses  I'm always stuffy  Do you do like  The sinus reconstructions  Yes I do  Are you good at it  Yes  You ever been sued  Has any doctor  Ever been sued  No  Or me  All doctors have been sued  Yeah  Is that a yes then  Yes  Bunch of smart asses out there  Think they can make a quick buck  Is what it is  Yeah  Now my thing is this  You said you can stop snoring  Now I've heard of the surgery  Where you implant  The little teeny tubes 
[02:48:30]  In the back of somebody's throat  Right  The soft palate  Yes  Is that the technical jargon there  Teeny tubes  Yes  You ass  No but it aptly describes it  Yeah  It's a teeny tube  They're like little cylinders  Made of a stiff  Dacron like material  Now if someone told me  That was bad to them  Put that foreign stuff  In your body  Is that bad  Well it's pretty well tolerated  In fact  This kind of material  Has been used  For 50 or 60 years  For various reasons  Really  In other parts of the body  Yeah 
[02:49:00]  Now like  My friend was telling me  That like what happens  Is when somebody is snoring  If there's an apnea situation  What you have to  Because of a skin flap movement  If you're not going to get it fixed  Then a sinus reconstruction  I mean it's just got to  Kind of revolve around  The whole thing  Yeah  Well certainly the nose  Is involved in it  But it's not as  Major a role  Who the fuck  Booked this guy  What's that  It was the  It's not just the nose 
[02:49:30]  What you're talking about  Not just the nose  It's the throat  The back of the throat  Exactly  Yeah that's  Because that's where  That's where you snore from  Really  Exactly  That's where the sound comes  So is it  Is it a  You're doing them for free  Lump of flesh back there  Flapping around that does it  Right  The soft palate  The back part of the roof of the mouth  Where the uvula is  That little piece that hangs down  Yes  The punching bag in cartoons  Right  The punching bag  Of course  That's right  The thumb stopper  Right  That plays a major role  In generating the sound  But also the back part of the tongue 
[02:50:00]  And the side walls of the throat  Participate in this closure  And relaxation  And that narrows the airway  And so the turbulence of air  That results  Causes the fluttering  And the flapping  Just like the rapids  In a river  A lot of times  If I'm like  How long does it take  To take effect  If you actually do that surgery  How long does it take  To take effect  Anywhere from a few weeks  To a few months  It takes that long  For it to wake  Yeah sometimes it does  Like if I'm hanging out  With my father  And he's like  Give me like a Roman war helmet  Or something like that  I'm still going to have  Trouble breathing  Well 
[02:50:30]  My health doesn't allow it  Yeah  Well for a short period of time  Yeah  Any type of activity  But eventually  If you put up with it  You will be rewarded  Will you?  Yeah  The hell  Yeah  How long have you been doing these?  Two years  Have you?  Yeah  Two years  And you got a success record  70-80%  Do you?  What is it like drinking?  Because I know a lot of people  Either if they're fat  Or drink a lot  They get sleep apnea  Exactly 
[02:51:00]  That plays a big role  During the deepest phase of sleep  All the muscles  Someone wake me up  When this horse shit is done  Especially in the throat  That can be affected  And made a lot worse  By alcohol  By alcohol?  Alcohol  Why is that?  Because the alcohol  Relaxes muscles  Does it?  Ah  And then when the muscles  Are relaxed  The tissue that is  Being held by the muscles  Kind of loosens up  Exactly  And collapses  And closes off  Does it?  I got you  Yeah  Wow  Now what is this  That the bed partners 
[02:51:30]  Of chronic snorers  Overwhelmingly  Women  Often bear the brunt  And a higher risk  Of fatigue  And even hearing loss  Exactly  Now how is that possible?  Well snoring can be pretty loud  And if you're right  Can it  Your ear is right next to the person  Uh huh  It can affect you  So you're saying  If your rear  Is close to the person  Right  That's snoring  When good it usually is  Unless you're sleeping  At the foot of the bed  Or something  Well you wouldn't sleep  At the foot of the bed  Or something  But I can't understand  How the snoring  If your rear  Is closer to the person 
[02:52:00]  Right  And some of these people  Snore so loud  The neighbors  Down  Down the block here  Do they?  Yeah  And I never thought  I thought  Like other things  Maybe music or something  But I never thought  Snoring into your rear  Would uh  Would uh  Make any damage  Well you know  Over a period of time  It can  Can it  You know  One night won't  How many decibels  Is that  When they snore that loud  Oh good question  I know  About 90  You know  50-60 decibels  And that's comparable  That's comparable  To what type of  Maybe machinery  Or something else 
[02:52:30]  We could put in perspective  Well  It's like  Like turning your iPod up  Is it  Into your  Like full volume  And uh  Just have that there  I heard  Until you go above  85 decibels  That's okay  Yeah 85 is about right  I think  Yeah 85 for  So if you're snoring  At 50  That's really not a problem  Is it  Because I've heard  When you put that iPod  Thing  Uh  The uh  The pods  In your rear  Uh  And turn it up loud  You could do some damage  Doctor I do a lot of production  I do a lot of production 
[02:53:00]  Where  Steve now  Coming into the conversation  I do a lot of production  And but yet  I my partner  My life partner  Um  He snores rather loudly  And I think  It's beginning to affect  My hearing  Um  What can I possibly do  To stop that  Uh  Sleep in a different room  Can I  That can't be possible  Yes  If I sleep in the other room  There'll be no reach around  They're attached at the hips  Hey uh  Dr. Kimmelman  Right  Uh  We got an actual snore 
[02:53:30]  I'm gonna play a clip  Of someone snoring  Okay  You're not gonna believe  That this is actually  Someone snoring  But it is  And I want you to tell  Tell everybody  What's going on here  A little professional opinion  Maybe  I know it's a little hard  Over the phone  But uh  This I swear to you too  That you're not gonna believe  This is an actual snore  But it really is  Here we go  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh 
[02:54:00]  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Doctor  That's my point  Have you ever heard  Anything like that  Oh yeah  You have  Sounds like a small animal rape  Isn't that great  It sounds like a velociraptor  Yeah  How would you like to be  With that all night  Uh  No not at all  You'd never sleep  The bed would be shaking  Yeah  Right  Your liquor cabinet  Would be empty  What can you tell us  About that snore  Well that snore  Is uh  Near total obstruction  Not totally  Because then there's  No sound at all 
[02:54:30]  Near total obstruction  Let me ask you this question sir  Can the lack of oxygen  Give somebody with a snore  Like that some type of  Brain damage  Absolutely  Wow  Yeah  It can cause strokes  It can cause heart attacks  High blood pressure  All sorts of other  Metabolic dysfunction  Can it cause uh  Maybe some type of uh  Damage to uh  The nervous system  The brain where maybe  You wouldn't uh  Be attentive  Exactly  And maybe  Attention deficit  You'd shake a lot  Perhaps  Yeah  Interesting 
[02:55:00]  Almost total blockage  Yep  Hey uh  Let's uh  Go to Bill in Arizona  He has a question  For the uh  The boring doctor  Hello Bill  Bill what's up  Hello Bill  Gentlemen  How are you  I was hoping the doctor  Might be able to help  Uh  It's actually my wife  Who's the snorer  Now that's odd  Quickly Bill  Uh  Now doctor  Many of the times  It's men  Correct  Right  But also women snore  Women do snore  Okay Bill  Bill from Arizona  Please continue  Well the  There is another 
[02:55:30]  Issue too  Uh  It is uh  More based on her  Gag reflex  Uh huh  And um  The gag  She has a terrible  Gag reflex  I'm not a large  Individual but she  Does gag quite  Frequently  Uh  I don't know if  This is uh  Uh  The doctor's  Uh specialty  Over here  It's part of it  But it must be  Part of it  A gag reflex  Sure  Well gag  It's deep in the  Throat right  Yeah  Well my big  Question is is that  Uh  She usually  Gags uh  Well when she's 
[02:56:00]  Snoring  Um  So my question is  Do I need to wake her up  In order to have oral sex  Oh that's a good question  It is a good question  Do I wake her up to have oral sex  Yeah  I don't think that's uh  Really his expertise  I don't know he is a sleep  That's a little out of my  That is a little out of the league  Are you saying that you  Kind of climb on  He wasn't talking about  Penetration  He was talking about oral  Now I don't believe  That that's uh  Uh  Well that's the only way  I'm able to  Get her to stop snoring  Uh  I'm having trouble  Getting her to stop snoring  But that's 
[02:56:30]  One way  But she does gag  I uh  Use her face  Like it's a piece of liver  The other procedure  That we've been talking about  Would be an alternative  Yes  Well that's true  What do they call that procedure  Pillar procedure  Because the little implants  Are pillars  They look like little uh  Are they  Columns  Yeah to hold up the roof  Oh  I'm sorry  Was that  Was that  Kill her  P-I-L-L-A-R  Oh  Because a friend of mine  Who lives in Modesto  I think he tried that  Procedure as well  He actually  And that worked  That worked for him  Didn't it 
[02:57:00]  Because his wife  Doesn't snore anymore  Right  The kid was snoring too  We all know the story  It's terrific  Yeah  That stopped the snoring  While I'm punching out  Thank you  Good doctor  And  Wish we could  Happy birthday  I'm glad uh  Doctor  You can uh  You know  Go with some of those  Questions  Because the call is  We never know  What we're going to get  Over here  Yeah  Yeah the spontaneity  Is good  Yeah but  You know  We want to  Pretty much stick  To the sleep apnea  Problem here  We try to have  A medley of merriment  Yes  Yes exactly  Exactly  Oh boy  Uh doc

[02:58:30]  Never thought of it that way  But I bet  A foot doctor says  We couldn't walk  If it wasn't for me  That's right  I mean  What you're saying  Is that one doctor  Will say one thing  And yet podiatry  Will say another  And yet  In another case  A chiropractor  Will say another  And yet somebody  Who probably specializes  In other areas  Of the teeth  The dentist  Will say the other  Chiroclactor  An ophthalmologist  Will say the other  About the eyes  Like without the eyes  We don't see each other  Right  Or maybe somebody else  Like a chest doctor  Would make that point  With a chest  Or a heart specialist 
[02:59:00]  You're not going to live very long  Cardiologist perhaps  Or somebody that might specialize  In the liver  And small intestines  Right  Gastroenterologist  Great gastroenterologists  We all know that  Something like that  Wow  Okay  But ear, nose, throat  That's where it's at  That's where it's at  You're an ENT  That's right  That's like three things  Though to know  Yeah  Like you know  You're a doctor  Maybe you want to study  The foot  Or the colon and the fist  Right  Big Kev is back 
[02:59:30]  Big Kev  Yeah this is the real  Big Kev  I'd like to ask the doctor  I was born without  A sense of smell  Will I ever get it back  That's very interesting  Because there are very few  People who do a lot of  Smell and taste work  And I'm one of them  Oh  Who does it  So that's another  Interesting  I got a question  Big Kev can't smell  But he still loves junk food  Wow  Like I don't get that  Big Kev  I don't love junk food  Well you can't taste 
[03:00:00]  Things either right  That's  Well I mean  I can taste most things  Yeah but most of the  Flavor of food  Is both smell and taste  And of that  Smell is the most important  But if he's never  Smelled since birth  Then he's  His body is focused on  The crunching sound  Of the Doritos  Well not only that  Yesterday's segment  Left a bad taste in his mouth  All there is to taste  Per se  Is sweet, sour, salty  And bitter  But the flavor of food  Is mostly smell  So he's developed  Highly his sense 
[03:00:30]  Of gustation or taste  Sweet, sour, salty  And bitter  So he's like a superhero  With a sense of taste  Exactly  So it's kind of  Really useless  That's right  Like when he's asking questions  He can taste an interview  Dying in his mouth  Good example  Speaking of  Good example  Holy shit  Thank you  By the way  By the way  Sweet, sour, and salty  Bitter  Are the taste  Tastes we usually  Talk about  I don't know how to end this crap 
[03:01:00]  In the Japanese culture  Yes, yes  They recognize a lot of other ones  And one of them  Do they?  Umami  Umami  That's like Bukkake, right?  No, it's the taste of glutamate  What's glutamate?  Monosodium glutamate  Oh, that they put in their food  Right, right  But it's a savory  You know  You know  Meaty kind of taste  I thought we were all  The same inside  How could another  Different race  Right  Well, you know  It's just a cultural thing  It's not that we can't taste it  Are you saying  They've been given the gift  Of the ability 
[03:01:30]  To taste something we can't  Yet we have been  Given the gift  Of driving  Right  Well, Doc  Do we have glutamates here?  Do we have glutamate?  Glutamates  Yeah  Oh, glutamate  Right  Yeah  I don't know  What that's called  What is that?  What is it?  Glutamates  I thought you were a specialist  Yeah  Right  We have that  Glutamates  Not only that  It's in your body  It's an amino acid  That's also used by the brain  To transmit electrical signals  Yeah  Oh my god 
[03:02:00]  He's still talking  So they're good for you  Holy shit  They're good for you  Yeah  If you put in ones  Like from Chinese food  Or something  Do they go to the places  That need to go to?  Yeah, but there's too much of it  And that's why you get a buzz  Yeah, but a lot of doctors  Have come out and said  That's a rumor though  And it hasn't happened that way  Does that have a population problem?  Oh, there's a bit  That's never going to end  It's not going to end good  That's uh  No, no, that's great  I  This is informing a lot of people  About a very serious problem  That I don't think they look at as serious  Because as growing up 
[03:02:30]  A lot of cartoons and shows  Have shown snoring  As something humorous and funny  Exactly  And it's a very serious problem  It can be a serious problem  Like, you know, Reggie  And now there's a solution  I was saying something  Jimmy  Reggie White  Uh  Yeah  Reggie White died of it, right?

Well you ask doctors this all the time  Like if I'm going to be a doctor  I'm going to like  I'm going to go for the vagina doctor  Because most of your patients  Are over 60  Some inborn issue there  They have to deal with  Yeah  Well do you think  That the medical profession  Has changed a lot  Recently  Because of  Litigation  Lawsuits  Absolutely  And be  It makes  All right go ahead  You talk  It has to  You know  You have to worry about that

[03:07:30]  I have a very bad thing  In the back of my throat  Where I'm always going  And I always have to  Clear my throat  Is that tied in  With my nasal drip  Like I take mucinex a lot  Yes  Especially dairy products  Make that worse  All right  You go ahead  I wasn't done  But go ahead  Yeah  Dairy products  Will make the  Aliva thicker  And give you more  Of a problem like that  A lot of times  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt  My question  A lot of times  I'll have coffee  And like I'm fine

[03:09:00]  Mucinex  Which does clear it up  But I notice  I have to take more  And more and more  And I'm not sure  It drives me crazy  And I think it's tied  Into the fact  That I have bad sinuses  Well it very well may be  I mean I have to examine you  To find out  What other factors  Are playing a role  Do you drink a lot of water  I do actually  I drink probably more water  Than is good for me  That's what people  Have been telling me  My whole life  I'm in the bathroom a lot  Which I thought  Meant diabetes  But it turns out  That it's just  That I drink a lot of water  Yeah  Right  And I'm not too sure  If that helps  It does help a little bit  It does help  But I like that  Oh go ahead  I'm sorry

[03:11:30]  Makes it wetter  No  My health doesn't allow it  Really  Yeah  I guess  It's a health problem  Yeah  You know  My wife  Used to  No she's dead  Used to take sprays  Yeah  Yeah  Good evening  Chris in Jersey  Has a question for the good doctor  Chris  Yeah  Hey Chris  You're on with the doctor  I had a question for the  I have a very regular snore 
[03:12:00]  It started up ever since I was a kid  I was at a particular sleepover  We were in a tree house  And my friend asked me  If he would  If  You know  He could  Do oral treats for me  And ever since then  I've had this very strange snore  Cheep  Cheep  Cheep  Cheep  Cheep  Cheep  Cheep  I was wondering if the doctor  You know  Could help me with that  It goes like  Let me see if I can get it right  I might have more of a handle on it  You probably are more familiar with this  You're talking about  It's like  That's exactly what it's like 
[03:12:30]  Yeah  Okay  That's a good question  Chris  Thank you  You ever hear a snore like that  Because there's so many different types of snores  That sounds like Popeye  Please  Code  All right  Yeah  But yeah  I mean the pillar  Would you address the question  Yeah  I mean we got the joke  It sounds like Popeye  But the guy was very serious there  No I know  I mean it's something that  That the pillar procedure  Would be

[03:13:30]  Bloody thick mucus  When I wake up  With my snoring at night  Someone told me about  Lighting a java log  And sleeping with that  Do you think that  Maybe that's making it like  Good question  Doc?  I'm sorry  What did he say?  Lighting a what?  Java log  Java log  What's that?  Yeah I'm letting a java log  It's like a  Manufactured chemical log  That you put in your fireplace  And I'm not sure

[03:26:30]  This  Is  The  Most  Animated  Interview  I  Have  Ever  Given  I  Must  Say  Is  Anybody  There  Med 
[03:27:00]  I  Would  To  To  To  Do  I  Good  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  To  I don't know. 
[03:27:30]  I don't know. 
[03:28:00]  I don't know. 
[03:28:30]  I should have hung up like fucking two hours ago.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen so many pissed off people in my life on instant feedback.  Oh, are they angry?  Go fuck yourselves.  Sometimes it's just about us. 
[03:29:00]  It was interesting and it was really good.  And it might have went a little too long.  What can I tell you?  He hung in there like a trooper.  All right.  We'll continue with these messages.  Oh, it's...  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude. 
[03:29:30]  Don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  Ah, let's get the energy back in the show.  John in Jersey, what do you have for the program?  I don't understand how anybody can think that that was bad radio. 
[03:30:00]  I was cringing so hard I got a hernia.  Yeah.  That was so uncomfortable, yet I couldn't tell you.  Well, here's the deal.  Anthony was saying that during the break, people either really, really, really loved  the last hour of radio, or they hated it.  There was no real in-between there.  Yeah, no in-between.  I enjoyed it myself there.  It was fun.  I mean, and those guys, doctors can be such dismissive pricks because I healed them with  my job, and I couldn't even help but feel sorry for the guy. 
[03:30:30]  I think...  And he's been caught in there so long.  It was just...  I think Jimmy's new character alone, interrupted guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Angry, interrupted guy.  Just the fact that that was born out of that nasty mess is well worth it.  All right.  It's hysterical.  In fact, the founder got in.  It was just complete radio.  The problem is the doctor hung in there way too long because, you know, we don't want to  fake it.  We were waiting for the guy to hang up, but it took forever. 
[03:31:00]  The guy was like fucking Rocky.  I liked him, actually.  It wouldn't go down.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Let's move on.  What's going on with Fidel Castro?  Apparently, he's...  He's eating a London broil.  That whole gag.  Castro undergoes surgery, hands power to brother.  I didn't even know he had a brother.  Who knew?  He's got a bro.  He had no idea.  Yeah, he handed power over.  But, a lot of people saying, this is just a little propaganda.  People are saying?  People are saying.  Hold on.  People are saying?  People are saying.  Fox News Alert. 
[03:31:30]  People are saying.  Please, come on.  How old is he now?  People are saying.  Yeah.  He might be a little older than that, Jim.  70.  80.  80 years old.  He's 80.  80 years young, I like to say.  He's 80.  I got it, Anthony, for you.  Right?  Is he 80?  He played for the Staten Island Yankees, didn't he?  Fox News Alert.  This just in.  People are saying that Fidel Castro may be dead.  May be dead.  We're working on this story.  Where does that come from, though?  A reporter's out in the field.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Where?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:32:00]  It's coming from Little Havana.  It's coming from Little Havana, where they're saying that.  Good old flower today.  They pull these shenanigans all the time, and they're saying that Fidel is dead.  Who's saying that?  People are saying.  People are saying that?  People are saying.  Probably dead, and the brother is in charge,  but they will keep Fidel, like, the idea of him alive so people don't get scared, you know?  And then kind of, like, fade into the new regime?  Yeah, yeah.  They'll look to, you know, they're under his iron fist even when he's dead. 
[03:32:30]  So are those people in the streets supposed to be celebrating that he's dead,  or that his brother's taking over?  I think they were celebrating that.  Let me get it.  People are saying.  People are saying they're celebrating because he's dead.  That's what people are saying.  Castro seeds power.  All right.  Hey, we got an update on the library jerker.  Library jerker.  Do you remember this story?  Yes, he did the only fun thing you can do in a library.  Yeah, here's the recap of the story. 
[03:33:00]  And then we have the update.  Interview with Carl Monday.  Michael Cooper admitted to pleasuring himself near the children's section at the Berea Library.  Wow.  He was on a pornographic website at the time.  It's a story we've been following since May.  Today, Cooper was in court for sentencing.  Carl Monday was there, too.  Buy a computer.  His inner monologue just the whole time has been, this is so wrong.  This is so wrong.  I'm going to get caught.  I'm going to get caught.  I'm going to hear the kids in the background focus on the site. 
[03:33:30]  Get caught.  That's it.  That's it, you dirty whore.  This is so wrong.  Well, here's the update.  Here's the update.  In many respects, this particular offense was a blessing in disguise because it was really a wake-up call to him.  One of the conditions of Cooper's probation was not allowed to step foot at a public library, or for that matter, anywhere where children might congregate.  Because of the sensitivity of this story, we asked Cooper's attorney to ask her client to make a brief statement after sentencing. 
[03:34:00]  She agreed.  Apparently, Cooper didn't want any part of it.  Cooper and his parents quickly escaped the courthouse through another door.  Michael, you didn't seem too happy about the sentence.  Any comment?  Get the hell away from me.  I said get out of here.  Get out of here.  Nice.  Get away from me.  Not on YouTube.  We attempted to leave.  Cooper and his dad try to get in the last word. 
[03:34:30]  You too!  Get the f*** out of my face!  Get in there.  Turn that off or I'll shove it.  Turn it off.  Now, turn it off.  Seconds later, a Berea police officer brought the incident under control.  Mr. Cooper, walk.  Mr. Cooper, walk away from me.  Get him out of my face.  Walk away from me.  Right now.  Get out of here.  Where's my kid?  In Berea, Paul Monday.  Get the f*** out.  What's my problem?  You're in my f***ing house. 
[03:35:00]  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  The best part is the anchorman with the very smooth delivery.  And then what you'll see here.  Wouldn't you just be, like, how's the cameraman not just going,  what's the matter, library, kid's section, jerk-off guy?  You a little pissed?  Kid's section, jerk-off guy?  You seem a little edgy.  Why don't you rub one out?  Why don't you just jack off?  You know why he's edgy?  The reporter there who was asking the question, 
[03:35:30]  he's leaving the 13-year-old boy?  Leaving the courthouse?  No.  He was the one that busted the guy originally.  Really?  Or did the story originally that got him in all the trouble.  Ah.  He's kind of just rubbing it in a little bit.  Rubbing it in?  Or rubbing it?  Hey, why don't we try to get this guy on the phone?  Yeah, that would be good.  He's from Ohio, right?  He may even be a listener of this show.  I'm sure he is.  I'm sure he is.  He's going to have a lot of...  He sounds like one of ours.  A lot of the characteristics.  Yes.  All right, can we get Brother Joe on the line?  Jacking off.  So there's the update on that. 
[03:36:00]  It got a little ugly.  What?  What do you use this for?  Jacking off.  Warren Jerome.  Is that a Charles Bronson movie?  Oh, yeah.  That was a...  What movie was it?  Which one was that?  Tenement, I think I was a great ass.  Oh, that was a...  Warren.  He's talking to his name as Warren.  Jacking off.  It's for jacking off.  He's just holding this.  Jacking off.  Look at a hairdryer with a plastic vagina on the end of the line.  Jacking off.  Let's go to St. Louis.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, buddy. 
[03:36:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Love you, buddy.  Thanks, man.  That's what I call a hands-on learning experience.  Oh, there it is.  There you go.  Thanks.  Hands-on learning at the library.  You just gave us a monarchy.  I had to rip a picture out of a book once, and I thought I was committing the biggest crime  ever.  I believe I was in the sixth grade, and I was in the public library.  So you can whack off to the picture?  We were on a field trip, of course.  We were on a field trip to the library.  He didn't wipe himself, too.  And they were teaching us about the library, and I found, again, the photography section. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  You go right for the photography section, you're going to find a section with nudes.  So I found this picture of some chick, big 70s earth mama moth, and big tits, and I wanted  that picture.  Pulse quickening.  Oh, just worked up into a frenzy.  My hands are sweating.  I'm just like, I need this picture.  I could jack to it forever.  It's really hard to steal something with a full-on heart on.  Yeah.  I'm shaking.  I had a rod.  I'm all nervous. 
[03:37:30]  I'm thinking how embarrassing it would be to get caught.  So I took that book and a bunch of other books and went to a table that was far away  from, like, a lot of people, but there was still a couple of people around.  And I opened up the book I needed the jacking picture to and a couple of other books and  kind of covered it a little like I was reading.  And so slowly, so as to not make any noise, ripped this entire, probably eight-inch long  piece of paper out of this book where it's like, just so slowly. 
[03:38:00]  And every time someone came over, I'd cover the book with another book.  I remember.  Yeah.  Like I'm reading.  And you're thinking in your head, almost there, almost there.  And I swear, my heart's going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And I'm sweating and I'm looking around all guilty.  And then, yeah, you get to the last, like, couple of inches of paper.  You're like, I'm almost there.  Just get it.  And then I got it, folded it up.  And I had to fold it, like, in the book.  So I folded it in half and shut the book.  Then I opened it back up, fold it, shut the book, which would fold it a little more until 
[03:38:30]  it was big enough to put it in my pocket, small enough to put it in my pocket.  Did you do the awful stretch?  Anything I could do to, like, let people know I wasn't doing this.  And then, yeah, I had a great jack to it.  It was perfect.  The end.  The end.  All right, we got Brother Joe on the WB11 morning news.  Yeah.  His U2 tribute band was on there.  I guess they're doing a tribute band contest.  Oh, by the way, Mom, turn the radio off for what I just said. 
[03:39:00]  Okay.  Oh, shit, it don't work that way.  We need the pest to go to WB11.com to vote for Brother Joe so he can move on.  Yes.  And to you.  Here is the segment.  Okay, let's see.  In sections.  Here's the first segment.  Let's listen.  All right, it's day two of our Battle of the Tribute Bands where you get to vote for your  favorite to perform live on our show Friday morning.  Today's band says they're not U2, but they claim to be the next best thing.  We caught up with the tribute band 2U at Calico Jack's Cantina here in New York. 
[03:39:30]  U2 is one of the longest running and most popular bands in music today, so it's easy  to see why the members of the Long Island tribute band 2U would want to pay homage.  I learned how to sing by singing, you know, U2 songs growing up and stuff.  So which was the first one that you knew all of the words to?  Um, probably Desire. 
[03:40:00]  Now, when they were singing Beautiful Day, was that Joe's band or was that really U2?  Ah, see?  Who the fuck knows?  It sounded like really U2 to me.  How about we ask Joe?  All right.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Yes, sir.  Joe.  Joe.  What?  Hey, brother Joe.  Was that your band or was that U2?  No, that was U2.  They used trailers like, you know, when they put it up front.  They did.  Oh, yeah, that was U2. 
[03:40:30]  That wasn't us.  Bastards.  I would have said it was you guys.  Yeah, I would have said, yeah.  Well, we sound like that.  What the hell?  We wouldn't be doing it as long as we've been doing it if we didn't, you know?  I got to address a couple of people.  No, I wasn't ripping out a picture of Hitler.  And don't let Ann fool you.  He was jacking to Holocaust pictures.  No, it's not.  Was it a girl in a little red dress in a black and white book?  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Hold on, Joe.  Ah, shit.  All right.  So that's the first segment.  Second segment.  Here's brother Joe. 
[03:41:00]  He's talking about not looking like The Edge and loving about the crowd.  The Edge and loving about the crowd.  Good typing there.  Are you ever told that you look like Edge?  No.  Never.  I'm Italian.  I look nothing like Edge.  The thing is, when I get up on stage and you cop the moves, you put across the vibe,  and you play the songs to the T, then people come up to you at the end of the show and they  say, wow, dude, you look just like Edge.  Two You has performed more than 200 shows nationally and internationally, and the boys say the thrill 
[03:41:30]  of taking the stage for the first time never goes away.  When you get people singing along with you and you get, you know, the crowd really, really  pumped, that's the best.  They sing, and they sing loud.  All right.  And then finally, the last segment with brother Joe.  This is something that we do to make a living.  We make a living at it.  It's full time for us.  We don't work day jobs, and we shy away from day jobs, you know, and we've gotten to see 
[03:42:00]  the world with it.  And they're great guys.  All right.  Don't forget, the band with the most votes gets to perform live on our show this Friday.  So go to WB11.com.  Cast your vote for your favorite.  You have until Thursday at noon, and you'll also be able to check out rock performances  by each band to give you more info on what they do. 
[03:42:30]  Welcome to you.  Yeah, and coming up tomorrow, speaking of great bands, we have a lot of pressure to  perform, is Freddie Mercury, or the guy who is a tribute to Freddie Mercury, actually  performed as long.  He performed fellatio.  Singing like Freddie Mercury, that's tough.  Looks exactly like him.  Favorite U2 album?  Joshua.  Joshua.  That's true.  Looks just like him.  What, is he dead?  Yeah.  Sleeping on a satin pillow with buck teeth and a load in his face.  Not too far off the mark there, Jimmy.  All right. 
[03:43:00]  So, Joe.  Yeah.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you, boys.  Good job.  And we'll have everybody that's listening right now go to WB11.com.  Don't spell out 11, by the way.  WB11.com.  And you do not need a new drummer.  The drummer's been replaced.  That drunken mess.  Oh, could you tell us?  A alcoholic to the nth power.  Brother Joe, you know I love you.  But when Anthony was telling me the story before the show yesterday, I was laughing so fucking  hard.  It's Spinal Tap, man. 
[03:43:30]  It was Spinal Tap.  Exactly.  It really is.  The guy was a goddamn mess.  I mean, Paul was there, and he could attest to it.  Yeah.  Can you just tell the story again?  Maybe there's something that...  Briefly.  Yeah.  He was in my face the whole day.  Basically drunk off his ass.  Could not speak.  Gets up on stage at Harrah's and starts giving the whole room the finger.  Great.  That's his Spinal Tap.  Fucking Harrah's.  The man's a piece of shit.  He has no idea what he threw away. 
[03:44:00]  Do you have video or anything of that?  I'm sorry?  Do you have any video or audio, anything of that?  I only wish I did, man.  It would have been gold.  What was going through your head when you realized he just decided to fuck up the gig?  I would have handed it to you guys.  When he realized he decided to fuck up the gig, what was going through my head?  Yeah.  I just wanted to beat his ass.  I wanted to beat the boy into the ground.  Did he actually play the U2 songs, or did he just...  No, he played, but he actually told me he wanted to fuck the setup on purpose so that 
[03:44:30]  my band would sound like shit in front of all these people, and I'd lose the gig at Harrah's,  which may have happened, may or may not have happened.  But I gave this kid at least five shots at it.  You remember the Halloween gig.  Yeah, he was a mess.  He was a little edgy there.  Oh, yeah.  He was a real jerk-off.  Yeah, one beer away from getting fired, and he was on the wagon for about seven months,  fell off of it. 
[03:45:00]  I wanted to take the kid out, man.  I basically called him out at a rest stop on the way home.  Oh, sexy.  Yeah, right.  I'll meet you in booth three.  Peek at me through the hall.  Go.  I wanted to beat his ass.  I told him, that's it.  Come on, let's go.  I went out onto the lawn with him, and he turned around and walked back to the truck.  I wanted to beat...  This is the first guy I've wanted to kick.  I've wanted to kick his ass, and I can't tell you how many years, man.  I'm not a violent person, and I wanted to beat his ass. 
[03:45:30]  What started the whole thing?  He's basically, he's a bad drunk.  I mean, he's a belligerent alcoholic.  He gets drunk, and he goes off on people that, A, do better than he does, B, have more.  I don't know what his problem is.  It's jealousy.  Basically, the last thing he said to me was, yay, motherfucker, go off and live off your 
[03:46:00]  brother's fortune.  You know, fuck you.  Oh, so he made one good point?  Yeah.  That's what you're saying.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, too.  Hey, you hear that?  Fuck you, too.  Wow.  Hey, Joe.  What did you two do?  Hey, what'd they do?  Giving you a living.  Well, I'm jealous that motherfucker makes mom right in.  And I do.  How's the new singer, Joe?  He kicks ass.  Brian DeVoe from Nine Days.  Absolutely brilliant.  Guy's great.  And, um... 
[03:46:30]  Wasn't the drummer from Nine Days, too?  It was.  Yeah, it was.  Oh, so he must have been like...  Dude, everybody knows this guy.  A reputation came along with him.  And I was told not to hire the guy.  Yeah.  I was told, do not hire him.  Stay away from him.  So you listened.  He's troubled.  No, I didn't.  I gave him a shot.  All right, brother Joe.  The big plug.  All right.  WB-11.  Go there.  Vote for 2U.  And then we're going to have to go to play live on the air Friday morning if we win. 
[03:47:00]  That's really cool.  And head up to...  Afterwards, head up to Foxwoods.  We're playing the Hard Rock at Foxwoods this weekend.  Cool.  All right.  Friday night.  Friday night.  And then hopefully Saturday you'll meet us at the O&A Traveling Virus in Worcester.  That sounds like a plan.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Cool, man.  Good luck, sweet potato.  There he goes.  All right.  See you all now.  Later.  To you.  Vote for them.  WB-11.  Don't spell out 11.  Dot com.  That fucking band.  Jesus H. Christ.  Enough.  He just...  It's just...  Are you getting nightmares?  Revolving door.  He should just start filming it. 
[03:47:30]  Just make it a documentary.  I know.  I know.  That could have been the best documentary over time.  Just filming this whole fucking clusterfuck of replacing people.  Kicking people out.  People coming back.  People getting thrown out again.  Like, over the course of the years, it would have been just brilliant.  You know what's great about Brother Joe?  He's doing a U2 tribute band.  This is his third lead singer, and he's pulling it off.  Yeah, third lead singer.  I know of three.  Four drummers.  I don't know.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  How many members have been in this band?  The lead singer's got to be the most...  Because that's what people are going to...  Yeah, that's what people are going to gravitate to. 
[03:48:00]  The guy they used to have looked exactly like Bono.  Yeah.  It was scary.  What happened to him?  Supposedly his voice was shot.  His voice.  Something happened with his voice?  I don't fucking know.  Maybe he needs that doctor.  Here's the translate.  All right, here we go.  Listen, we got a few things to do, and we get out of here.  We got...  Snotty.  I try to sing.  We got three stories that we haven't gotten to, and we also got a corporate email.  These are always fun.  I don't like the...  Oh, you mean...  Is it from an important boss? 
[03:48:30]  No.  No.  We got...  We all have...  Oh, the BlackBerry emails.  Oh, go fuck yourself.  That's why I don't even have a BlackBerry.  We've explained this from time to time, you know.  You get corporate email that's very, very important from Eric Logan and people that work on the show and this and that, right?  And some important updates from Washington, as far as XM News goes.  And then you got these dopes that take advantage of the fact they got a corporate email account,  and they'll send an email to the entire company. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, that's why I threw that thing against the fucking wall.  Stuff like, hey, guys, there's cupcakes on the second floor in the kitchen.  FYI.  FYI.  You know, if some broad loses an earring, they have to send out an email to the entire company.  Looking to sell my Chevy Camaro.  Anyone interested, email back.  Table in four chairs.  It's so frustrating because you get enough emails from corporate to begin with, right?  So I'm tooling through my email yesterday, and somebody sent out this email and thought it was so good that everyone should partake in this. 
[03:49:30]  It was right on top of it.  Yeah, but I thought it was like an email.  I thought it was a few emails, like ridiculous emails, a collection of.  No, no, no.  This was all sent out as one email.  I wish I had the guy's name, but I just forwarded it to Than and he.  What an asshole.  This guy sent this email to the entire programming staff of XM Satellite Radio.  It was an email, and basically the title is Rearranging Words. 
[03:50:00]  If you're down in Washington and you got this email and you know who sent it, walk up to him in the hallway and just punch him in the face.  And rearrange his face.  Just punch him in the face, and he won't know what happened until, like, the next guy punches him in the face.  Because this is the shit that drives people crazy.  I thought these guys were out of radio.  I thought these type of people were out of radio.  Enough.  So, Rearranging Words, sent to the entire XM team. 
[03:50:30]  The first one is dormitory.  You rearrange dormitory, and you get the two words, dirty room.  I shit you not.  You know what's another funny one just on the list?  Hester Moffat, the rest of me.  Very good.  How about iron sulfide? 
[03:51:00]  Fool's cold.  Fool's cold.  Presbyterian.  You rearrange those letters, and you get...  Filthy Jew?  Oh, I saw Mel Gibson on the bottom of this sea seat.  And you get best in prayer.  Oh, is that awful.  Astronomer, when you rearrange those letters, you get moonstarer.  Oh, that's cock up the end.  Do they have...  There's a funny one, the tunk.  Do they have that when you rearrange it?  No, it's tunk.  How about ginger? 
[03:51:30]  Think you can get a good one out of ginger, can't you?  I just came up with that.  Hey, you're brilliant, dude.  Desperation, when you rearrange those letters, you get a rope ends it.

[03:54:30]  Massachusetts governor apologizes for tar baby comment.  We all know what tar baby is in this room, right?  He's claiming he doesn't know what tar baby means.  Tar baby.  I only knew the derogatory term, but then I heard that there was a term that people do use that  isn't supposed to be derogatory.  Are you kidding?  Right.  Yeah.  It's black.  I only knew the derogatory one.  What's that for?  I heard that there is another way to use this word that doesn't mean a black person. 
[03:55:00]  Ginger.  Well, Governor Mitt Romney has apologized for referring to the troubled Big Dig construction  project as a tar baby.  A tar baby.  During a fundraiser with Iowa Republicans.  Well, didn't he say that the problem was there's been just a whole jiggaboo of problems?  Tar baby is a sticky situation.  A sticky situation.  Is that like the original?  I've never heard that.  Meaning of it?  And someone said, you know what else is? 
[03:55:30]  It's something to do with a small doll.  So he covered his ass?  Back in the olden days.  What?  A small doll covered in tar that was used for something.  I have no idea.  Practice?  For what?  Practice.  Oh, you know, Than?  Well, I was just...  No one can hear you, Than.  What does it say?  Well, I guess it gained popularity through the Br'er Rabbit stories.  Right.  The Br'er Rabbit story where a tar baby, a doll covered in tar was used to catch Br'er 
[03:56:00]  Rabbit in the...  What books are those?  Br'er Rabbit Chronicles.  Shut up.  It's Tom Sawyer.  Uncle Remus.  Uncle Remu.  Uncle Remus.  That's great.  Uncle Remus.  Uncle Remus.  Please.  And then the sequel, Too Late.  A Tears on the Pillow.  Uncle Remus.  Yeah.  A tar baby, which was, you know, black, but then it was used as a derogatory term, but  it was...  It's known as a sticky situation, yeah. 
[03:56:30]  And that's how he was using it.  Like, Jimmy's sheets are a tar baby.  There you go.  But what's amazing, he had no idea that there was another definition.  That I can't believe.  Exactly.  I can't believe that.  No, no, tar baby is one you don't hear that often, to be very honest.  Yeah.  You hear that in the lists of racists.  Yeah, but no one says tar baby.  No.  Plus, if he knew what the other way people use it...  Why would a governor say that?  Yeah.  He's Boston.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's Boston.  He also said...  I thought that guy was dead.  He himself was spooked to drive through the tunnel.  Yes.  But he didn't want to pay anybody because everyone says he's behaving niggardly. 
[03:57:00]  We all know.  Right.  Exactly.  He just didn't know.  Very difficult.  We're going to award the people that are still listening to this horse shit.  Hey.  We have five pairs of tickets to give away to see OzFest today, right?  Yep.  Today.  Tweeter Center in Boston.  If you're in the Boston area, you can get your ass to the Tweeter Center for OzFest.  We got tickets for you.  Give us a call right now as we end the show, okay? 
[03:57:30]  Bill Burr, thank you so much.  Thank you for having me.  See you this Saturday, buddy.  Yeah, Bill will be doing the ONA Traveling Virus Saturday.  And Friday, he's in the Hamptons.  Friday.  Guildhall.  Friday at Guildhall.  Guildhall.  Myspace.com slash Bill Burr for all information.  Or Jim Norton.  By the way, OzFest, we want to thank Jägermeister for getting us the tickets.  Yes, Jägermeister.  Very cool.  When are we talking to what's his name with Tommy Lee?  Maybe tomorrow.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll see if that's set up or not. 
[03:58:00]  Is he coming in?  No, no, no, no, no.  On the phone.  We're going to talk to him on the phone.  We got to patch things up before we get in person with him.  Well, they're going to promote Roxy.  We'll start tomorrow, so.  Oh, what?  You guys trash us?  Oh, of course.  There's a problem.  How many people do we...  It's a 50-50 shot.  Whoever we talk about, we got a problem with.  No, not anymore.  What?  We're cleaning up old problems.  We just added in a doctor.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we gave him a lot of plugs, though, that guy.  That's right.  And he might be very good. 
[03:58:30]  He was a good sport, so if you need work...  He's probably still wondering if we were fucking with him or not.  Yeah, we should be thankful.  Yeah.  All right.  He did hang in there.  Did he?  We'll end with this.  All right.  You would know.  Go ahead.  My friend Rob Cullen, I got that from.  Oh, it's a great gag.  We were out...  No, just the you would know.  We were outside.  I would never work out when I would go on the road with Dice.  I would just stand outside and smoke cigarettes.  And Rob Cullen hated the gym because it was homoerotic.  Rob is Wayne Newton's actual godson.  I should have mentioned that, but I forgot.  Oh.  And he's a funny fuck.  And we were outside smoking. 
[03:59:00]  I'd kill my parents if Wayne Newton was my godfather.  Why would you do that?  Because then he'd be responsible for taking care of you.  I'd be like six years old and kill my parents.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's all.  It's a very sacred position, the colored family.  Godfather.  But Rob and I were outside of this.  I think we were in Phoenix.  We were in Vegas.  It was really hot.  And he said something about, man, it doesn't get this hot in L.A.  Or it gets this hot in L.A.  And I'm like, no, it doesn't really.  And because he lived there and I didn't.  So I'm like, no, it doesn't really. 
[03:59:30]  He goes, oh, you would know.  It was just such a great way to shut me the fuck up.  Just shut you right up.  You would know.  All right, let's get out of here.  Bill, thanks.  Lou, the trucker, we end with you.  Good morning, buh-buh boy.  Lou, I'm just trying to.  Lou.  Lou, I'm just using you to set up a bit.  So just hurry up.  Lou, start all the wars in the world.  It's the loos.  Are you a loo?  A dirty loo. 
[04:00:00]  Well, I was thinking maybe Brother Joe could, maybe if he heard Jimmy's audition tape, maybe  he could land him a drummer then.  Jimmy did do a little drumming in his day.  Yes, I did.  And this is how we end today.  Unless you got...  Hell no.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the O.P.N. Heaven Eats Show. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah!  What the f*** was that?

[04:01:30]  Get out of here, twat!  It's me, baby!  Stupid friggin' twat!  This is a turn-off.  Go for the post.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  How do I can shut my ass?  Get in the coffin.  Howdy, faggot!  You son of a bitch.  I don't know why.  I just did it right.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  You son of a bitch.  I don't know why.  I love you.  I know.  I love you.
