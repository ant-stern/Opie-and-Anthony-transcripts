<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring recorded phone calls between a man and a woman. The man's angry, demanding tone, punctuated by offensive language including racial slurs ("You're a pain in my ass"), dominated the calls.  The hosts speculated on the man's emotional state and the woman's motivations, analyzing the potential fallout of their strained relationship. This was followed by a rant from one host about a wrongly purchased Entenmann's crumb cake, before returning to the discussion of the recorded phone calls.

The show then shifted to a comical, yet somewhat desperate, attempt to get Jim Norton's picture (featuring him and the American Idol judges) signed by Jennifer Lopez, who was a guest at the studio.  The hosts and crew documented the absurd efforts, offering a running commentary filled with vulgar language and speculation about J-Lo's reactions.  Their attempts ultimately failed as J-Lo left before Norton could approach her.  The segment concluded with reflections on the event and Jim Norton's character.  Throughout this section, various commercials aired, including ads for tax services, trucking companies, online dating sites, educational franchises, health supplements, and other businesses.

The next segment saw Jimmy attempting to secure Jennifer Lopez’s autograph on a photo, which was intercut with a detailed review of many other pictures in his celebrity photo collection, ranging from complimentary to highly insulting descriptions of the pictured individuals.  This was followed by a disturbing account from Jim Brewer detailing a family situation involving his aging and ill parents, his sister's potential threat to their mother, and his mother's aggressive behavior towards his ailing father.  The account was filled with profanity.

A caller, Dan Mancini, then recounted his mother's alleged physical abuse of his bedridden father, including slapping, punching, and pulling ears, which had been ongoing for at least two weeks and witnessed by home health aides.  Mancini, with the hosts acting as a makeshift social worker and therapist, confronted his mother on the phone during the broadcast.  His mother denied the allegations, blaming her father's behavior and revealing a history of abuse in her own life and past relationships.  Mancini also shared that his sister suffered a severe facial burn as a baby, with the origin unexplained by his mother. The conversation ended with the mother largely unrepentant. The hosts then reflected on the gravity of the situation and discussed Mancini’s upcoming documentary.

The show continued with a discussion about a listener's 85-year-old mother's behavior, marked by fear, memory issues, and potentially abusive dynamics with her husband. The hosts speculated on the reasons for her behavior with humorous and crude tangents.  A significant portion of the segment then dissected a Yakov Smirnoff's Dinner Adventure promotional video, relentlessly mocking its production quality, food, forced patriotism, and overall presentation.  Numerous callers contributed to the ribbing of the video and shared anecdotes about Branson, Missouri.

A listener's call about restaurant choices segued into morbid jokes, before shifting to a comedian's poor performance and the hosts’ breakfast experiences.  Commercials for Retro Fitness, IRS tax services, oil well investments, work gloves, and email security software aired during this segment.  Comedian Rich Vos then joined the show, recounting fabricated stories about his supposed work as an FBI profiler while playing golf, embellishing details with increasingly absurd inaccuracies. Jay Mohr briefly entered the studio, engaging in a brief antagonistic exchange with Rich Vos.  Other guests – Colin Quinn, Jim Florentine, Joe DeRosa, and Kurt Metzger – joined in the disbelief and humor surrounding Vos’s stories, followed later by Bill Burr.  The death of comedian Patrice O'Neal became a recurring topic, prompting discussions about his career, personality, and anecdotes from the hosts’ and guests’ experiences with him, including a media report mistakingly stating his age as 14. Amy Schumer and Louis C.K. also joined the conversation. The segment ended with more reminiscing about Patrice O'Neal and further teasing of Rich Vos.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment dedicated to remembering Patrice O'Neal.  The hosts and a guest recounted numerous anecdotes about O'Neal's comedic style, abrasive on-stage persona, surprisingly friendly off-stage demeanor, interactions with audiences, quick wit, insightful observations, provocative conversations about race, interactions with women, and substance abuse.  Specific jokes and observations were shared, along with reflections on the impact of his death.  The overall tone expressed appreciation for O'Neal's comedic talent and unique abilities while acknowledging his flaws.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's less fucking trouble. They clean up after themselves.  They make your goddamn bed, which you did not.  You don't have to worry about emotional blackmail or any other bullshit that you put me through.  I just need a nice woman to look after my beautiful daughter.  I don't get the fucker or anything.  You're a pain in the ass.  You're a pain in my ass.  Stop being that. 
[00:00:30]  You're a pain in my ass.  Nothing but...  And that's where that tape ends.  That's not the greatest cliffhanger since fucking The Empire Strikes Back.  Tape number five comes out in 45 minutes.  Wow.  And she hangs up one a long time because at the beginning of the other tape, he starts off,  don't you fucking hang up with me.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  She's not now because she's recording.  Right, so she's just fucking... 
[00:01:00]  You think he's on to it now?  What is he doing?  Maybe he's drunk or high.  Yeah.  Maybe he's listening to it with complete embarrassment.  Maybe she's not recording today.  No, no, these were all made before.  These conversations already happened.  He's not just continually calling her.  These are done.  She's a ball.  No, no, I mean now.  What is...  Oh, literal Jim.  What is he feeling now?  What is he feeling now?  I'm embarrassed.  I didn't tell you.  Oh, literal Jim.  Like he'd still be calling. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, and by and beside.  All the tapes are out, and he's still calling.  I'm embarrassed.  Shut up.  Boom.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  He's probably sitting there going, oh, God.  I hope she didn't record that other thing.  That's what he's thinking.  There's one he's worried about.  Yeah, yeah.  He has no idea which ones were recorded.  It sounds like they had a lot of these conversations, and she probably finally fucking hadn't started 
[00:02:00]  taping them.  He's probably praying, oh, God, please don't have the fuck Haiti call recorded.  Oh, please don't have the fuck Haiti call.  Jesus.  That's what I'm saying.  They can't handle a 7.0?  Those weak, dirty, foreign niggers?  How weird is it that he needs the bed made?  How many guys need their bed made?  Well, he probably has a daily fucking maid.  Yeah, yeah, comes in.  But he wants her to do that.  Jesus.  Wow.  What is radar online?  Is this thing big?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  It's the guy from MASH waiting for something.  Oh, shit.  You want Jimmy's line again?  I want Jimmy's line again.  Oh, yeah.  Can we hear it, Travis?  I didn't mean it.  He starts off, don't you fucking hang up with him.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  She's not now because she's recording.  Right, so she's just fucking.  You think he's on to it now?  What is he doing?  Maybe he's drunk or high.  Yeah.  Maybe he's listening to it with complete embarrassment. 
[00:03:00]  Maybe she's not recording today.  No, no.  These were all made before.  These conversations already happened.  He's not just continually calling her.  These are done.  She's a ball.  What is he doing now?  What is he doing now?  What is he doing now?  Oh, literal.  Wait, what is he feeling now?  What is he feeling now?  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow, Jimmy.  Listening back to that.  When Patrice was saying he's drunk or high, I thought that he meant, I misunderstood him,  so I thought he thought.  That call was just made.  And I thought you said that.  And then he's still calling. 
[00:03:30]  What, you got me in the pain of mindless, kid?  And I thought you said the calls were made already.  The calls were made.  I'm an asshole.  I'm a fucking cunt.  That was great.  How's Mel Dillon?  Man, he's a complete.  He's just such a powerful guy.  He'll just go, ah, so don't forget it with my next good movie.  You know what?  Yeah, he's got plenty of money.  He makes his own movies.  He don't care.  Now, what did we ask for from Entenmann's?  That that was it.  The chocolate chip.  What did I say?  Crumb cake.  Entenmann's just crumb cake.  You wanted regular crumb cake.  Crumb cake and chocolate chip crumb cake.  Crumb cake.  I love crumb cake. 
[00:04:00]  Don't say it like that.  Why?  It's delicious.  Don't say it like that.  Oh, the chocolate chips?  I'm not saying that crumb cake is not good without them, but I prefer...  This sucks.  It's got like a creamier feeling to it.  It says loaf cake on it.  Who the fuck wants to eat loaf?  What is that?  That means...  Hold on, no.  That means it's a lazy cake, you know?  Oh, it's loafing.  Loaf.  Also, I asked for the Entenmann's crumb cake, the original.  Well, and of course, Steve bought Ultimate.  I said, I don't want Ultimate.  I don't want double crumb. 
[00:04:30]  I don't want any of that shit.  I just want the fucking regular Entenmann's crumb cake.  You don't have to make it better.  It's already great.  I think Steve bought things that Steve was going to want to eat after the show.  I asked you for the regular fucking crumb cake, Steve, and you get the ultimate crumb cake,  you fucking cunt!  Blow me!  I've been nice to you, and you get me the wrong fucking crumb cake! 
[00:05:00]  You cunt!  I just want somebody to get me the right crumb cake.  See, I'm ready to pass out just doing that.  I deserve to be blown before you put a watermark on it!  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I want to be blown, and then I'm going to take your website down!  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:05:30]  Yes, Mel, calm down.  Stop hollering at me.  When are we going to fucking find out what she did?  Mel will have a way of leaking.  He has to.  He has to at this point.  Unless it really is nonsense like this, that's just a power struggle in a relationship.  Maybe, like she said, he needs medication or something.  Really, you think?  Off the defense.  You need a bat up the side.  I deserve to be blown before the jacuzzi.  When that's the zenith of your argument, you have to go with the medication. 
[00:06:00]  You know something, though?  I do believe I heard that Sunday at the party.  So, I might not be just crazy.  Hilarious.  Yeah, you said it to Danny.  I know.  You didn't need to be told.  Danny said, why are you so happy?  And you said, I deserve to be blown before the jacuzzi.  Thanks, pal.  We'll be right back with more of the best of O.B. and Anthony.

[00:10:30]  Welcome back to the best of the Opie and Anthony show.  2010.  Why is it that the rest of the world has ancient civilizations that they go way the fuck back  and where we live in the United States, we can't go back that far.  Why wouldn't there be life on the entire Earth and then something catastrophic had to happen?  It should be popping up everywhere.  Well, no, because you have the ideal situation and circumstance in one place and that's what happened. 
[00:11:00]  You think that's what it is?  Apparently it was in, you know, Africa, you know, the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia.  And then things kind of spread out from there.  You think it's as simple as that?  Yeah, I kind of do.  And then I think that's why we don't really have a lot.  Why do we only go back to Injuns?  And they obviously were really stupid.  Yeah.  Because they gave away everything.  So they weren't that smart.  Here's Manhattan for a fucking shiny thing.  Oh, I know.  Smart business.  See that thing you're dragging behind your horse?  How about you put two wheels on it? 
[00:11:30]  Make it a little easier for your horse.  Ted the Indian just gave up Manhattan.  What are you going to get me for this hunk of land?  Do you have a trinket, please?  Something shiny.  Hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya, hoi-ya.  Ted the Indian, look, I'm throwing garbage at your feet.  Oh, God, I'm going to laugh.  Why?  Why are you stopping the commercial shoot?  Oh, wrong emotion, I'm sorry.  I litter a lot. 
[00:12:00]  They threw me out of the truck.  I was Ted the Litterer.  A little litter bug.  I was a litter bug.  I love littering.  What do you think of Thanksgiving, Ted the Indian?  I don't like turkeys, Gregory.  They make too much noise.  They frighten me.  When I was a baby, they would peck my genitals in the crib.  Uncle Paul would hold the turkey over my genitals.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That was the best of O.B. and Anthony.

He's got a picture with everyone from American Idol. 
[00:22:00]  American Idol cast.  Everyone.  Including Ryan Seacrest.  And now he wants J-Lo to sign the picture.  It's not good enough that he's got a photo with everybody.  I did Leno with him.  I did a tonight show with the cast.  They were the lead guests and I was...  And you took a picture with him.  He was all four of them.  And now he gets the picture blown up.

Look at these fucking zombies here.  She looks good, though.  She looks really good.  Does she look good in person?  Oh, she was juicy, man.  Very juicy.  Yeah, I like that, though.  She lets you put your fucking fingers on a hip.  Dude, they were there for a while.  We tried to get everybody...  She was the first one I did.  I'm like... 
[00:23:30]  We put our arms around each other.  We just waited for everybody to show up.  How was the hip?  Fucking amazing.  Felt good?  As good as you think it would.  Yeah, you felt a curve.  He didn't even acknowledge...  He didn't...  He didn't care.  He just wanted the picture to come out nice.  He don't fucking know.  I remember the way her back felt because she had an open back dress and my hand was actually  on the skin of her...  Oh, was it sweaty?  No.  Did you smell your hand after?  No, I'm not that creepy.  That's not creepy.  If you touch somebody's back like that...  What, Patrice?  I was looking at Norton.  Maybe I should have did what he did. 
[00:24:00]  It's just like it's interesting to me that Norton is this much of a fucking dude that  does this.  Yeah, yeah.  And I should be.  I should just be taking pictures, but I don't know why I didn't do that.  I have no acknowledgement that I'm in this business.  It's better that way.  There's no proof that I've been doing this for 20 years.  Norton is all over the world.  I mean, I'm impressed, but then I'm like, eh.  I take select pictures.  Not every person that comes in.  Very select.  But a few of you are like, oh, yeah, I want a picture of that person. 
[00:24:30]  But I was like, why not?  Like, I could have got them individually.  No, I would shut up.  Why not?  I would take that picture in a second.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course I would.  Oh, he's not allowed to talk about this.  We already know what Norton does.  Why not?  You get pictures with fucking...  I do sometimes go with nobody.  Yeah, anybody.  But now what happens with Norton, he will carry that picture around until he gets every one  of those people in that picture to sign it.  That will be the obsession now.  But I didn't get...  It'll start with hopefully J-Lo today, which I doubt.  That's going to be really tough. 
[00:25:00]  And then eventually he'll get Steven Tyler and the rest of those guys to fucking sign that  picture, right?  You want all those people...  Yeah, why not?  Then you frame it.  It's just a cool thing to have.  Why not again?  Why do you have that?  How do you...  Why do you have that picture?  That's what...  You just...  Why do you have...  To me, the picture would be good enough.  No, I just knew she was going to be in the building today, so I brought her here.  Oh, you knew it already.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's way ahead of everybody.  Wouldn't that be great if you just pushed around a file cabinet, four pictures...  J-Lo, wait a minute.  Are you under J or are you under A for American Idol? 
[00:25:30]  I'm not sure.  He's fucking...  And how do you ask?  Say, hey, would you mind signing this photo of us?  And they never say no.  Leave, scum.  The only one that has ever said no to a picture of us being signed was Jeter.  That was the only asshole.  And did that fuck you up for him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, did I give him a beating.  You should have heard him go off about Derek Jeter.  Yeah.  He's not a Yachty fan anymore because of that.  That's exactly it.  That's exactly why he didn't do it.  He seems like such a dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, no problem, man. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but he was just being a fraud.  No, it was a big deal to him not to sign it.  Jimmy tried a few different times, too.  And it was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I had the pen out, and so he would know that it wasn't.  Jimmy made it as easy as possible, too.  It wasn't.  Maybe he listens to the show and doesn't like Jimmy.  No.  Come on.  But it was a thing where he didn't like me.  Because there's been guys that have asked me to sign things or take a photo.  And I was like, sometimes you just meet people you don't like.  And I know that was part of it.  So you understand that?  Why do you hate them?  Maybe you just look crazy.  You look bad.  To not sign a photo of us together. 
[00:26:30]  It's like, you know I'm not going to sell this.  I could see a baseball.  I would understand.  Oh, he's picking up selling it or whatever?  He's just being a twat.  It was a picture of me and him.  Damn.  I've never refused that.  It was at a charity event.  Yeah.  He should have offered some money to the charity.  But he would have signed it.  Dude, XM had paid $25,000 for the table we were at.  Yeah.  It was mind-boggling.  And he wouldn't do it there?  No.  I asked him three different times, and he said no.  And he knew who you was three different times?  He didn't know who I was, but he knew what I was asking.  Would you wear disguises? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  He just said no to...  That turned me on athletes.  I fucking hate baseball players.  Most of them are just cocksuckers.  They try to be funny and interesting.  They're boring.  Most of them are boring.  Now, did you...  Did you believe this before he told you to go fuck yourself with the pitcher?  No.  You thought they were great guys before that.  I'll tell you, it was the first time I had met a bunch of them in a row.  There was a bunch of the Yankees there.  It was a Yankee event.  And every one of them, except Giambi, was a fucking twat. 
[00:27:30]  But Giambi was trying to come down off the steroids.  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  That's like meeting Ben Roethlisberger right now.  Or Michael Vick right now.  Like, hey, everybody.  Hey, I'll sign anything.  Hold your puppy.  Hold your girlfriend.  No problem.  I'm not even going to stick my finger in the asshole.  So Giambi don't even count.  Because he was coming down off the fucking steroids.  Yeah, he was probably a dick before this.  There's a balance that you get.  But, like, I've met Cosby twice.  Both times. 
[00:28:00]  He fucking sits there with you.  He talks to you.  He asks you questions.  He's lonely.  But he's still nice.  How many goals have you loved him?  You're right.  Catch Derek G when he's 77.  He'll sign everything.  Both his hips.  He'll be like, aren't you the guy?  Jim will walk up to him like Godfather 2.  Antonio Andalini.  And just cut him up the front.  They're just fucking...  You didn't sign my picture.  He was a prick.  So many of them are pricks, dude.  A couple for now. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This way he keeps you screaming.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I see a posse.  I see a posse.  Oh, that's actually how she just walked by.  Oh, that's why...  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  That's why these two dudes were staring at me.  Oh, shit.  I was coming in this morning and there was a, that, that guy and then a little aversion  of that guy, the big, the black dude that she's with, evidently is her bodyguard.  Yeah.  I say, what's up, bro?  And they gave me that, that, uh, the once over kind of thing. 
[00:29:00]  But, you know.  All right, let me, let me, let me, based on what I just saw, let me make an assessment.  There's not a chance.  You are not fucking getting near.  That's a guarantee.  If you got money on it, I, I, I'll put it on.  I will.  Norton will not get a chance.  Not only get this thing.  Not only was she the center of a fucking people convoy going down there.  She was unrecognizable.  She was in the fucking, uh, right in the middle of an animal coat.  Which means she don't care.  She had a coat on, she had a coat on, and her big hood pulled over her head as she 
[00:29:30]  walked with her face down, down the fucking hallway wearing sunglasses.  Norton, she is, Norton is, Norton is calling his political, he's texting his political connection.  He's texting somebody.  Shut up.  You know, maybe we could use some of your contacts.  What is Kenny doing now?  He's on the case?  Oh, shit.  What?  Where is he?  He's there.  He's going to take care of you.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  It's not, it's not usually hard to get them here.  They're all, everybody.  They're going to run in.  Kenny, can I, after, do it, do that.  Let me talk to you a second. 
[00:30:00]  Kenny, Kenny, this doesn't count.  Come on.  We got to talk to Kenny.  Kenny, Kenny, get Kenny in here, man.  Kenny, it does not count.  Kenny has connections with other guys who protect other guys.  Right.  No, that was Steve Leeds as the head booker here.  Yeah.  And that's the guy that, uh, they usually, all the bookers will help you.  It's like, it's not that hard to do here.  I wasn't going to bum rush her with her bodyguard.  I would, I would actually stop and ask the publicist.  Look, we did Leno together.  They feel, they feel bad.  They don't want to say no to somebody you did TV with.  They just feel stupid saying no. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no one knows that as a psychological profile.  But I would never say no.  I'm muscling people for a fucking.  Why, why?  I would never say no.  I would never say no to him.  Hello.  Hi, Kenny.  Thank you.  Hi, Kenny.  Kenny.  What?  Where's the picture right now?  It's in the custody of Stephen Leeds.  Stephen Leeds.  Yes.  Who will now walk up to, uh, J-Lo and, and have her sign.  Go to her publicist and go, look, this is, they do this.  She'll look at that picture.  It's on the Tonight Show.  Why wouldn't she?  The entire game.  Yeah.  I hope she signs it.  The muscle game. 
[00:31:00]  In the wrong spot.  I hope she signs it in the spot that I know Jimmy doesn't want it signed in.  Because it's about, wait, where's he going?  I don't know.  He's got, wait, wait, wait.  He's walking down the hall with your picture.  Steve Leeds is walking down the hall.  He's finding a secretary to sign J-Lo's name.  He's not going to bother J-Lo.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's that.  Sam's running after Steve.  Look at his stupid face.  Jimmy is freaking out.  Please.  Here's why I'm freaked out.  I'm not freaked out.  The whole show is on pause for that picture and sign.  He probably left it with her publicist.  Because the envelope he's carrying is too small to carry the picture. 
[00:31:30]  And I hope he doesn't have it in there and he's bending it up.  That's what I'm bothered by.  Oh, Jimmy, you can't take this.  Sam, come here.  Sam, Sam, Sam.  Sam ran down the hall.  Norton just swallowed his gum.  This is great.  Sam, what happened?  Because Steve Leeds had the Jimmy picture for J-Lo to sign.  And he was over there down by the studio where J-Lo was broadcasting.  He's not going to bother him.  And then he just walked away and down the hall with the little envelope.  He's still holding the picture.  Why?  He's not going to bother J-Lo. 
[00:32:00]  He said he's going right now.  He said, I'm going to Greenstein's office.  Tell him to calm down.  Yeah, he'll do it.  He'll do it.  Steve will do it.  She's here for an hour.  He said, tell him I'm putting it in the paper shredder.  Yeah, that means he'll get it done.  What if it's in that little envelope getting crumbled up?  Then it's not going to be crumbled up.  He'll keep it straight.  Steve Leeds is good.  And here's what a great bet this would be now that this other guy has it.  I still bet he doesn't bother J-Lo.  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be a problem.  I got $10. 
[00:32:30]  I don't know whether it's getting signed or not.  But I know there will be a problem.  Put your money where your mouth is, man.  Let's just do a $10 bet.  A $10 bet.  I'll bet you $50 and it gets signed.  I'm only going to bet $10.  I'll bet you $10.  Because this is a 50-50 deal.  I'll bet $10.  But I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  I know.  You think it will.  Yeah, I'm starting to think it's going to get signed.  But you should also know that Steve Leeds might be annoyed because when Kenny handed  him the picture, he said, watch the fingerprints.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  You would say to Steve Leeds?  Jimmy's looking like, oh, Kenny, you fucked it up. 
[00:33:00]  That would be a problem, though.  No, that's not a problem.  No, if there were fingerprints on the picture, Kenny would hear.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's why I said it.  Yeah, but, you know, he knows.  What if she signed it over, like, fucking Steven Tyler?  Actually, it wouldn't matter to me where she signed it.  Really?  Nah, because if all four of them signed it.  You want it, but you'd best want it, like, low on her, right?  The reality is this.  I just took the fucking...  I took the holy grail of signed photos in yesterday for a framing, so this is all nice.  And what wasn't...  My Sabbath.  My signed Sabbath, that's all I...  That's in life. 
[00:33:30]  Everybody.  Got them all.  Can we talk about them all?  Me and the band, and I finally got the fourth one.  Yeah, I had to be sent to L.A.  I had to go to L.A. and do it.  It was a fucking nightmare.  It was a clusterfuck.  Let's talk to Steve Leeds.  Can I bring up a topic while you're killing time?  Yes, sure.  Troy Kwan has a new mixtape out, and when girls hear it, they just spread their legs.  Really?  Yeah.  And what's on the mixtape?  It's like disco.  It's great.  Disco?  Yeah.  You got a copy?  No.  He posted it on Facebook, but it's online or something. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, oh.  Are you working for Troy Kwan now?  No.  I just...  This means nothing.  The guy works hard, and he's good, you know, doing music.  So I just wanted to plug it, because when girls hear it, they spread their legs.  Is that what he said?  No, that's what I say.  That's what I say.  Which means when Kenny heard it, he got on his stomach and opened his asshole with his  face in a pillow, hoping Troy would fucking come in and dive in like Greg Louganis. 
[00:34:30]  Here comes Steve Leeds with the picture in hand.  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Oh, look.  It's folded up inside that fucking envelope.  Oh, he's...  Why is it in the envelope now?  It shouldn't be.  Oh, goddamn.  It really is in the envelope.  It's rippling.  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Steve.  This has become a thing, huh?  I have faith in Steve Leeds.  Good morning.  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, there's your mic.  You don't have faith in me.  I do.  Get over here.  Get over here.  Oh, I do.  You know how to do a radio.  Good morning.  What's going on, Steve Leeds?  I tried to text you, but I think I had the wrong number. 
[00:35:00]  The great Steve Leeds.  I don't know about that, but...  Can I ask who Steve Leeds is, by the way?  I'm Patrice O'Neill.  How are you, sir?  Steve Leeds is a legendary record guy.  He runs the booking department here.  And now he runs the booking department.  Steve, who'd you work with in the past?  A little Zeppelin action?  Way back?  Oh, back in the Stone Age?  Yeah.  Zeppelin, Stones, ELP.  Hmm.  Spinner's, Aretha Franklin.  No, it stops with Zeppelin.  So, legendary name in the game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Foreigner.  Foreigner.  Nice. 
[00:35:30]  Now he's just doing a little hobby.  Like, just...  He doesn't do it anymore.  And what'd you do over there at MTV?  I was the director of on-air talent.  Responsible for being the guy who went out and found new VJs and maintained the ones that  we had.  Who'd you find?  Jesse Camp?  Colin Quinn?  Jesse Camp?  Yeah.  Was that his name yet?  Ken Oldman?  No, no, no.  I wasn't.  Who'd you find?  Adam Sandler.  Judy Brown?  Rosie O'Donnell.  No, not the original Julie Brown.  The other Julie Brown.  Downtown?  No, Downtown was there. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  When she went out.  The white Julie Brown.  The white Julie Brown.  Right, right.  The Queen's got a gun.  Right.  That was her thing.  Yeah.  Adam Curry.  Who's like a fucking billionaire now, right?  Yeah, he's doing very well.  Internet.  He got into the...  Oh, into internet.  He got into internet earlier.  The podfuck.  He invented the podcast.  Do you know that he actually...  For zillions.  Wow.  He went to MTV and said, I'm going to register MTV.com.  And they said, yeah, go ahead.  Oh, boy.  And they didn't know.  And then they kind of had to sue him to get it back. 
[00:36:30]  And he was like, you told me I could have it.  You didn't want it.  Did he get any money for it?  I think they settled.  They settled.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's doing okay.  I guess.  Do you talk to him still?  Oh, yeah.  What a guy.  He actually had a daily show here for a while.  Who hasn't?  How many millions did they give him?  Not.  Not.  Shit.  Every night it was a bunch of podcasts strung together.  Now, look how fast he forgot about Norton's picture.  No, no, no.  I hope he places it down in the top of a dumpster. 
[00:37:00]  We'll get to that.  Sir, I pray you don't get this thing.  This is very important.  Steve's got a lot of history, though, in this business.  This photo's very important to Jimmy.  Steve will do it.  It's an interesting photo because it's got all the current judges and a guy named Jim Norton.  Yes.  It's a very unique photo.  Yeah.  So, I have no problem, when she's done, asking her for the autograph.  And Kenny said, careful, no fingerprints.  Gave you two colored markers.  You can just use black.  It's fine.  I didn't ask him to say fingerprints.  I was scolding him for that.  No, it's fine.  You know better.  I thought it was interesting.  No, but Kenny was protecting himself because if there was a fingerprint on it, he would hear it. 
[00:37:30]  What can I do to have you not do this, sir?  Anything I can fucking do.  I'll be your bodyguard while I'm here.  I'll just walk around with you.  But look at that guy.  Come on.  Why do you want to mess with him?  I just want to see him pretend not to be tortured.  I'll be bothered.  And meanwhile, he would be.  Here's a guy who has a great career.  He's on the radio every day.  Thank you.  He's got some best-selling books.  This guy is just nice.  It makes me sick.  I want this.  I want you to trip and fall in a shredder.  Whoa!  And just to see his stupid face, sir. 
[00:38:00]  But this is the only thing he lives for.  It is true.  He has a great gig.  He's got a career.  And what he likes is getting his picture taken with celebrities and trying to get them  autographed at the appropriate time.  Oh, my God.  J-Lo just walks by.  She left already.  She left.  As you're talking on the radio, she just walks by.  She's doing Hits 1 now.  She's doing Hits 1.  Why did she walk the other way?  Don't you think this would help him, sir, in his low self-esteem, like, his jersey,  white trash, like, problem that he has where he has to take pictures with celebrities? 
[00:38:30]  Hey, Roland is coming in.  They say she's already signed.  She's got two minutes.  All right.  You want to grab her?  No, I can't.  That Roland.  You guys are so mean.  He nailed you.  Because he gets me every time.  Roland gets me every time.  don't you funny this  nothing in you wants to see him suffer 
[00:39:00]  she's right there  I think he suffers plenty  we just don't see it  if this is what he needs to feel good  then he's suffering  do you know how much he wants to tell you  could you not fiddling with it so much  I think he'll be fine with the picture  that was one of the greatest  we're looking at the picture the whole time Steve Leeds has been in here  did you just glance over the wisdom of this guy  Steve isn't handling it like Jimmy would  he's kind of like rustling it around a little  and Jimmy's like looking at it  where are you going with that 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy wants to know  I said well I could go to the bathroom  you better not go to the bathroom  with the picture  but I wasn't going to the bathroom  see this guy has Led Zeppelin stories  and now he's the go between  Jimmy and Steve  after dealing with Jimmy Page  and Robert Plant  Jimmy's easy  you got a good Zeppelin story  actually the best  it's probably 10 million  actually the funny story was  when Robert came up here  to do an interview  and we had a very attractive young lady 
[00:40:00]  as an intern  with tattoos standing outside the studio  and he said  what's her story  I said  she's an intern  what's an intern  I said well  somebody who comes here  and they get academic credit  to learn the business  he goes  you think she'd like to learn  about the ways of the road  and he had just told me this story  where his wife caught him  messing around  and was like  giving him a slap on the wrist  I said  didn't you just tell me  he goes  yeah  okay never mind  and then 
[00:40:30]  I told the intern that  she's  oh that's great  I can't wait to tell my dad  he used to go out and travel  and follow Led Zeppelin  all over the place  oh my god  tell her dad  that she might have been able to  fuck Robert Plant  fuck Robert Plant  actually  the first time I met Robert Plant  he had Alison Steele  you guys remember  sure  the night bird  she had a show  for the men and women  of the army reserves  and so  it was the first time  she went off site  usually had to go to her studio  but she went to the Plaza Hotel  and go to Robert's room  and he's got one of these 
[00:41:00]  canopied beds  and he's lying there  with his long golden hair  and he's barefoot  and he's on the bed  and she's holding the microphone  in front of him  he says  so Robert  where do you see yourself  20 years from now  and he looks at her  without missing a beat  and goes  here in my bed  with you by my side  oh  wow  that's um  so he's basically just uh  listen  after what today was said  you shouldn't say anything  I hated that story Lee  you don't like that one  I hated that story Lee  I don't think we liked that one  that made me sick 
[00:41:30]  I liked it  that's the same  I know a plumber  that got that same story  well I'm gonna leave you guys  thank you  don't do it  please sir  look at that face  why would you want to do anything  to upset that face  you know what  he actually brought down my evil  by saying  if he needs this  to live his life  he knows  the misery of his life  this is so important  that why would you do that  that  I actually  he actually brought me off  of my evil  just with that  really 
[00:42:00]  have you ever been to his apartment  or his house  about five years ago  before he lived  where he lives now  I thought that was  one of the most impressive things  is his  collection  museum of pictures  okay  so think about that  he has some sort of  esteem issue  that he has to have that there  so  well I wouldn't look at it like that  you know what  but that's an inside  to all of us  that's just a great way  to look at it  that he needs that  how many people in this room  have a picture  or a painting of themselves  hanging in the wall  of their house  you probably have one maybe  of your baby  and your wife with your kid  just pictures really 
[00:42:30]  but I mean  can you imagine  having an oil painting  of yourself  hell no  oil painting  of yourself  who has an oil painting  of themselves  a lot of people do  Voss  Voss  stupid Voss  stupid Voss  I forgot about that  so anyway  Jimmy you're welcome  and I'm happy to help you  thank you very much  in your dilemma here  thanks  now step and fetch it  now  it ain't happened  now  he's just happy  to still have a gig  thanks buddy  God bless Steve Lee  he really is a legend  a fucking legend 
[00:43:00]  in this business  as he goes away  from where's he going  she's over there  does he know where she is  I couldn't believe  that she went that way  she's still that way  she's still that way  I can't believe that  fucking safe  Led Zeppelin story  he told  I know  the worst Led Zeppelin  story ever  he met a girl  and said you want to fuck  and what  and we just made  Steve Lee walk the wrong way  now he's going that way  he'll go around that way  he knows where she is  yeah  oh Norton  is just telling himself  Jimmy's freaking  oh shit  here comes to Yonaraj  stop it  look  that's a truck 
[00:43:30]  Roland got me good  Roland is a one man entourage  so basically  he's a  he's a bigger time  Roland almost like  yeah  he's the company's  Roland  he's in charge  yeah  she's fun to do  everybody thinks I'm crazy  and then they'll always see one  and they're like  fuck I wish I would've got that one  oh it's impressive  when you check it out  but it looks exhausting  my picture with  that's my issue  I got a photo with Carlin  where he's dressed like a priest  I'm dressed like an altar boy  and I got him to sign it  that's a good one  that is  that was from  what  no one would argue  that it's not impressive 
[00:44:00]  it's not even impressive  it's just a fun  it's like I like to do it  it's not fun  though  but it really is  we see the stress  because it's not fun  when I'm over at somebody's house  or if I see photos like that  I'm like  oh that's so fucking cool  that you have that  like I save like little  I save like little  mementos and shit like that  I'm a saver with that stuff  I've always been  I think you think it's fun  after you have it  yeah it is  it's sometimes a pain in the ass  but I think getting it  is probably a problem  probably 
[00:44:30]  I would want to do it  if I wasn't in the business  so I'm in the business  and I can do it  so why not  yeah  that's what I really  there's no reason not to  I don't look at myself  like we're a bunch of equals  I'm just a fucking fan  but I literally  want nothing to do with them  after I take the picture  like  really  you don't want to sit and talk  and get to know  my  get a relationship  I think my girlfriend  at the time was with me  I was doing Leno  and Affleck  Ben Affleck was the other guest  who was the lead guest  and he came into my dressing room  just to go say hello  and introduce himself  so I'm like 
[00:45:00]  hey man how are you  and he's like  cool  and he's like  what's going on  I'm like nothing  would you mind taking a photo  he goes no no  that's cool  so we took a picture  and then he was just  kind of standing there  I just sat down  and he's like alright  like I had nothing else to say  to him after that  I was done  two social in that boobs  yeah  but you didn't want to socialize  no  about what  he wanted to  if he had the ability  if I had  exactly  Patrice is right  if I had the ability  no not you  Ben Affleck  me I don't know  what to say either  he's probably just as bad  what are you working on  what are you working on  I didn't care  I got a picture 
[00:45:30]  I want to download it  yeah but there's  nobody cares  nobody when they  first talk to a celebrity  gives a shit about  you know  what they're saying  you're just trying to get  a rapport going  dude I'm terrible  I'm fucking terrible  with celebrities at rapport  you're not  you know why  because you muscle them  for pictures and autographs  maybe I don't muscle them  so muscle them  for friendship too  I don't muscle them  I don't want to be friends with them  put a pistol against the edge  sign this  and then perform what you do  make G to swing a bat  that was the next thing  hey G to just 
[00:46:00]  do me a favor  get in the bat swinging stands  and fucking let me  he told her  either her brains  or her signature  would be on that picture  fuck dude  I mean but if you go to  Norton's crib man  it's an impressive  array of shit  it's star studded  that's what it is  and it's all me  bothering celebrities  it's not  yes  but I don't ever play it off  like yeah look at me  and my famous friends  by the way  those people are short  the American Idol cast 
[00:46:30]  is short  yeah  because Norton is what  5'6"?  5'3"?  are you trying to squeeze  an inch on me somewhere?  5'7"?  5'6 and 3 quarters  ah we can go up 5'7  Steven Tyler must be what then  like 5'11?  he had heels on too  he's a  yeah  high heels  yeah he did  he had boots on  he told me a Steven Tyler story  well he  one morning he got up  and said I want eggs  instead of bacon  you know what  you had to say it though  we all knew the story sucked  yeah  we were just giving him a pass  he's been around so long 
[00:47:00]  but he's such a  he tells  he'd tell a safe one  he wouldn't tell like  he's got some  he comes with  the cum is stuck on  Robert Plants  I like how it's like  and Allison Steele  said where do you  hope to be in 20 years?  here in my bed  with you at my side  it's like what does that mean?  that was a PBS  that was a PBS  Lex Eppelin story  yeah that wasn't even  a fucking  what did he mean by that?  and Allison Steele's been  dead for 10 years 
[00:47:30]  yeah good luck  means he wanted to fuck her  I guess  big fucking  just a skeleton  with long nails  and long hair  laying next to him  she's dead  yeah where do you want to be?  in the tub  with you and the shining lady  but that's why he has  so much access  because everybody knows  they probably can trust him  yeah  oh oh oh  it's gonna happen  alright something is  something's brewing  there's like  she might be on the move  there's an energy  out there in the hallway  yeah too many different 
[00:48:00]  things out there  gay  black  Chinese  eric  eric take a peek  out the door  what's going on  is she wrapping up  over there  give us a full report  let's take a look outside  poor little fat kid  eric  she's just in that room  just controlling that room  I can hear you  he says  what's up B  um  it just seems like her  like her hairstylist  her publicist  security  they're all just waiting  by the door to outcue  waiting for her to get out  outcue  what a smart ass man 
[00:48:30]  who was that  it was rolling  here's what I'm gonna start  does rolling even work  he's taking pictures  of the people in the entourage  yeah  just go outside  and take a picture with them  yeah with the entourage  this is J-Lo's people  and all you have  a bunch of pictures  with entourages  that would be a very new idea  a unique new idea  do you know  fucking twice in one airport  Dice got me  when I was just  starting to work with him  dude he told me  that one woman  was Ann-Margaret 
[00:49:00]  and I'm like  it's Ann-Margaret  over there  but he goes  that's her over there  and I took a picture  with her  but it wasn't her  and we were in Nashville  and I have a picture  with a guy  who I thought  was Charlie Daniels  he picks good enough people  where you'd be like  it might be  like he's not saying  like that's Dustin Hoffman  I remember  I go have a picture  with you  he's like  oh my god  yeah I have a photo  with a guy 
[00:49:30]  I call it  not Charlie Daniels  did we see the picture  if I have it with me  did he ask you  why do you want  a picture with me  I don't remember  I know he was  befuddled by it  what did Ann-Margaret say  yeah what did  the not Ann-Margaret say  I think she just  took the picture  she probably didn't know  what it was for  because if you just  walk up to someone  in the airport  and say  can I take a picture  with you  wouldn't they just  say why  this is before  9-11 though  this is small  airports like Nashville  I think  I find people's  uh oh  someone on a phone  little makeup case  yeah this is fucking 
[00:50:00]  oh shit  they're on the move  Steve Lease  is in the hallway  Steve's in the hallway  he's eagerly awaiting  the entourage  should be  oh oh  here they go  here they come  here they come  one  two  three  there she is  she's got her coat off  looking just lovely  whoa  she's got her hair  bumped up  he'll ask the publicist  oh shit  Steve Lease is walking  right next to her  he's out of sight now  that's her  that's her  but that was it  yeah he'll get her  she's going to hit one  he's coming back already  oh shit  oh Jimmy  it didn't look good 
[00:50:30]  because she looked down  at the picture  she didn't just go  sure  she said something  it didn't look good  ah damn  she might have  what is Roland saying  who didn't roll  was that an ass  that was the famous  J-Lo ass  that wasn't bad at all  Jesus  I don't know though  I want to  why do we say  you want a longer look  I want to  I want to feel it  uh oh  update  oh shit  how did she look  I saw the ass  up close  yeah  she said the same thing 
[00:51:00]  when she walked by you  I'm going to say  he passed my mirror  he didn't get it signed yet  but Steve Lease  broke the ice  and was talking to her  yeah I'm sure it's fine  was she friendly  there's no ice break  it's a sign and shit  no  it's just  either do it or you don't  she looked down  her arm stayed straight  to her side  she looked down  there was some body language  going on  I didn't see any  do you have a pen  kind of arm moving up  that's an immediate thing  Kenny  Steve Lease knows  what he's doing  I like Jimmy's picture

[01:02:00]  I'm telling you  he was on her  when she came out man  we've been stalling it  get this picture signed  I don't want to  you signed autographs right  have you ever in your life  thought about it  no  you either do it or you don't  and if you didn't do it then  did you come back  and do it later  no  no  shut up  running out of time  I don't want to hear  nothing to convince yourself  that this is going to happen  can we get an update  Steve get back in here  knowing the way  no don't ask Steve  because he's out there  let's see  we'll ask him after the break  let him do it 
[01:02:30]  because she might  because she might come out  and if he's in here  it's going to screw it up  she came out  no she's in another studio  she's running away  after this  Steve  yeah  oh yeah  let's get Steve Leeds in here  let's not see me  speaking out  don't get him in here  let's just do it  Kenny's watching  the door  oh no  Steve  oh no  do we have an update  do we have an update  I don't  is there an update  on the signature  no no no no  she's doing her interview  now  but we saw you  doing a little small talk 
[01:03:00]  while you guys were walking  to Hits 1  I was  what were you saying to her  I was just  Jimmy is peering out the window  like a hawk  how mean he wanted me to be  and it's just against my  it really is  he truly has a nice energy man  he's a nice man  he's truly a nice man  nice aura  why do you want to hurt that guy  I don't anymore  not because of you  it seems like  you explained it perfectly  I always thought being nice  was horseshit  but his niceness is not horseshit  it's kind of different  okay  so yeah  so when she's done  with Caliente  and before she leaves  we'll get it autographed 
[01:03:30]  thank you  can I ask you  an autograph  don't ask me  Jimmy's freaking  let me ask you  Jimmy is losing his fucking mind  how about after the break  we can ask him  we're going to be late  autograph etiquette  Patrice tends to be a little wordy  so this can really make  sir autograph etiquette  when someone is walking  they're not moving  why wouldn't they just pick up  take the picture out of your hand  as you're walking  and then sign it as you're moving  which I would think  would be the correct etiquette  no I think  I think before  before you leave 
[01:04:00]  in the lobby here  Steve is she moving  because they're saying  she's on her way  Roland is telling you that  Roland never tells you the truth  why would you believe Roland again  he just got you 15 minutes ago  it was obvious  he was fucking with you again  is she moving  I love that  is she moving  you know who's the dick  who turned me down  Busta Rhymes  that was the one rapper  that wasn't cool  and T.I. the first time  I asked him  and you asked him again  no I had a different  different location  I asked him here  T.I. was not very nice 
[01:04:30]  and Busta Rhymes was not nice  the only two rappers  every other rapper's been great  Busta Rhymes said no  yeah  why did Busta say no  he just said no  he was just being a prick  later I'll ask him  or whatever  he's just being a dick  he said later  yeah whatever  just like what J.Lo did  coming out of that room  oh shit  it was at a junket  yeah  maybe you can get tickets  to the final episode  of American Idol  and just  get them all  yeah  Lino can probably  get you in  and just go fucking get them all  I'm just watching Kenny  I know  Kenny's  Kenny's the barometer  Lee's a little fucking  flaky at times  a little light 
[01:05:00]  oh he just went that way  a little aloof  but he's  he's never  Steve's never  messed this up though  neither has Liam  these guys are the best  yeah  yes  good for them  you know what  I don't see a lot  I don't see a lot of  fan photos with J.Lo though  I don't see a lot of  photos of her  well that's true  without her being alone  or in some type of context  or with her husband  oh boy  there's no pictures  I don't see any pictures  of her with people  oh boy  with fans  not a one 
[01:05:30]  not a one  all by herself  not one  her and her husband  oh shit  she just doesn't do it  she doesn't do it  she don't want  she's too hard  to get next to  oh boy  but she's Jenny  from the block  yeah  she keeps it real  she keeps it real  just her on the couch  oh boy  oh man  her husband again  oh boy  she don't even have any  with P. Diddy  no  fuck that  yeah those are  ancient history  this means she likes to  control what 
[01:06:00]  every picture that's taken  type in  type in Patrice O'Neal  yeah but the picture's  already taken  just type in Patrice O'Neal  let me  let's see  let's see  it's just  O'Neal  it's just a thousand  pictures of me  with people  look at you  with people  the third one  is you  a little white girl  in a mall  just sure  at an airport  somewhere  in the midwest  just fucking  no problem  whatever  yeah yeah  come on  come on in  they're on the move  they're on the move  they're gonna be  walking right by the window  that'd be fine 
[01:06:30]  they just went that way  this is the not  Charlie Daniels guy  that is so  wow  that's funny though  that Dice would  point that out  because it's close enough  she's moving  where'd she go  her shoes  her children  she didn't move yet  no she's not to move  they're gathering her stuff  which way is she going now  she's gonna go  oh she's coming from that way  down this way  good luck Jimmy  so we're gonna get  to see the ass 
[01:07:00]  yeah let's look at the ass  yeah let's look at the ass  as it comes by  that guy must have been like  why the fuck  is this idiot  taking a picture with me  because he should have been  but he must have been like  it must be because  I got the big hat  because he looks like  a cowboy type thing  so he probably thought  oh this New Yorker guy  wants a picture of me  with a cowboy hat on  or he's gay  and thinks I'm attractive  oh Shirley MacLean it was  not Anne Margaret  Shirley MacLean  Shirley MacLean  you got that one too  let's see what Shirley MacLean  looks like  Shirley MacLean  oh my god  that looks nothing

[01:08:00]  I want to get a good look at it  oh ok  I want to get a good look at it  yeah it's really  I got a good look at it  yeah  watch all the people  that walk by this studio  let me see this famous booty man  alright  alright here it goes  they're clearing the hallway  they're  they actually clear the hallway  for her  yeah they got the  the hallway's being cleared  here she comes  why wouldn't they clear Roland  look at you  I know  he looks like he could be a problem  he looks like a  he looks like a  let me see  let me see  let me see  there she is right there 
[01:08:30]  ok hold on  let's see if it's  hi  let's see if you can  oh my god  holy shit  that thing defies gravity  look at Steve  it ain't happening  and there goes the picture  of his son  he's chasing her around  he's bringing him below  he's officially part of the entourage  he's behind the makeup people  he's chasing her around  did you hear Roland  Roland goes Steve right too  Steve  this shit ain't happening man 
[01:09:00]  why isn't the picture signed yet  why  did you see how fucking good it looks  why can't she sign it  she's uncomfortable  as she's walking  her ass was  it's not a rest  what  it's not a rest  why can't she just sign it  as she's walking  she will  because he  honestly he probably didn't ask her  he did  no he didn't  he asked her when he came out of that  when she came out of that fucking room  he did  guaranteed  right before that corner  he asked her  I saw  he didn't ask her 
[01:09:30]  he did  she said nothing  he was talking to her  he didn't ask her  I'm telling you  she probably did it  not yet  not yet  here's what it is  this is politics  yeah  she's  you know  it's a very incestuous business  she can't tell people  when anytime you go there  that there's gonna be someone  bothering you for an autograph  when you go to the radio  yeah yeah  she gotta know that  she'll report that  they bother you  it's like I don't wanna go there  because now fucking  people are gonna be bothering me  for autographs  yeah  she'll take it  the Jim Norton J-Lo picture  has shut down the show 
[01:10:00]  it still hasn't been signed  by the way  and she's got a  she's got a hard out  at 9 o'clock  10 minutes to go  to get this thing signed  she keeps it real man  she does  she does  gunshots  she'd be around  she knows where she came from  but autographs man  you can't  you know  you don't sign no motherfucking  autographs from the Bronx  she's doing her third  and last radio show  and then getting the fuck out of here  oh Steve Lee's walking down the hall  without a picture  swear to god  shit  no picture in his hand 
[01:10:30]  that means he probably gave it to her  publicist  oh yeah  because the publicist  is always going to make sure  it gets signed  yeah because that's what they do  they're nice people  or maybe he left it there  with Liam  that thing's in the garbage  you just don't  he has anxiety  Liam may not be easy on the eyes  but he's very good at this  so it's either Liam or Leeds  hopefully  I'll have to wait and see  oh here comes Steve Lee  he's walking by again  oh he ran  he's running by 
[01:11:00]  that was a speed walk  oh boy  he probably got the word  she's in the elevator  if he runs by  there's too much shit going on  like there's too much stuff  going on for this  it should be easy  it is  it's a person  signing something  that's not why he's running  dude this whole thing  is not about my dumb photo  he's running around  because she's doing different shows  so they're trying to  they're trying to get her  to and from these shows  oh is that it  yeah  my picture is a fucking  a minute  moment  it should be 
[01:11:30]  do you understand  it's a fucking picture  that has to be signed  by one person  and it will happen  why is this a big deal  but it's not  oh it is  look you gotta hand it off  it's going to places  he gives it to the publicist  it can't be between here and there  it's gotta be after that  it's a big pain in the end  let me tell you something  we'll get her at the end  if J-Lo gets  with all those people  if J-Lo gets a picture  in her fucking hand  yeah  that like right away  someone will get fired  wait wait  if she gets a picture 
[01:12:00]  in her hand  Sam's got an update  Sam's got an update  obviously  hold on hold on  one of the major bosses  that people don't like to  just saw  do things  yeah is walking up  to meet with her  yeah that could be a problem  that could be a  walked people out  in the past  that could be a monkey wrench  thrown into the works  right there  it won't be  oh no  this is the power of positive  I'm telling you  page three of the secret  envision it  it will happen  shut the fuck up 
[01:12:30]  this will be such a buzzkill  if this picture comes back signed  it'll be such a buzzkill  oh man  it'll get signed  yeah I actually think it will  there's been times  where I didn't think it would  it's gonna get signed  like who didn't you think  would sign here  I didn't think Springsteen  would get done  and it didn't  I was pissed  but I knew that kind of wouldn't  Jeter  when Jeter came in  I left that with  I knew that wouldn't get done 
[01:13:00]  it didn't  why  because  I think  they were mostly with Scott  like I think the bookers  were kind of scared to win  because I think he was  walking them around  so they didn't want to  you know  that's their boss  uh oh  what's going on  photographer  they don't want to  but that means she's done right  she's going to go by again  yeah  oh boy  check  watch  get a little recon  okay  check it out  and by the way  give us a thumbs up  when they're coming  by the way  is Mars still standing out there  like a fucking vulture  look at him  thumbs up  he's so excited  get Mars in here real fast 
[01:13:30]  look at Mars  yeah  get him in here long enough  so he can miss her  look at his hair  it's all fucked up  he's a mess  what's going on with you  he's a fucking mess  he's got cum in his hair  are you alright  he had to put the cum somewhere  you fucking  where are you from  why is Sam running  we're moving  we're moving  what do you mean  she's moving  they're moving  here we go  here we go  here we go  J-Lo's coming back around  after doing another interview  take a look at it  one person going  it looks very very good 
[01:14:00]  alright  one person  um  just stepped out  she's usually first or second  in the entourage though  waiting for the rest of the  not like the Kennedy motorcade  where there's a whole bunch before  there's only a couple  and then they all fall behind her  which is where you want to be with her  there she is  watch this  okay here we go  here we go  there she goes  alright  look at what she looks  she looks  big  oh shit  oh shit  he's still got  look  look at leads  he still has the picture  oh shit  he still has the picture  oh shit

I can't  I can't even talk about it  So what's  what is going on?  So my dad  lost his hearing  alright  but this has happened before 
[01:30:30]  he gets so much wax  in his ears  they clog down  Holy fuck  and they clog the hearing  and you have to go to the hospital  and they drain  they pull it out  and drain out  and literally  like a huge  golf ball chunk of goo  will come out  it's just  it's disgusting  Bigger than what comes out  of your mom's eye?  A little bigger  a little bigger  Rich  Yeah  vicious rich  That was nice though  it was nicer 
[01:31:00]  It was just a question  It was more of a question  It was more of a question  It was just a question  I'll give him that benefit of the doubt  So  she goes  Oh my god  she was  I heard  I heard  dad screaming  and I turned the bedroom  and she had  open hands  just  pouncing his ears  like  just  pouncing  both ears  Like when you do it  like in a movie fight  Yes  Where you do that movie  where you 
[01:31:30]  whack the ears  with the palms of your hand  Correct  Pow  And the guy goes  Ah  Yeah  And then she's  pulling his ears  like really hard  and he's going  Ah  Now he's in the bed  He can't even get out of the bed  He's 88  Holy shit  And she's going  Can you hear me?  No  Oh Jesus  It's uncomfortable  Terrible  Now in the past  In the past 
[01:32:00]  I almost  I almost moved him  out of the house  because  I saw him  trying to get out  of his chair  and I came in the bedroom  and I saw her  shove him  back in the chair  and then he'd fall back  and he's like  Jesus Christ  and she's like  I'm the one  that rules you  I'm like  and I walked in  and went  Wow  Whoa  Whoa  What the fuck  What the fuck  is going on?  Are you uncomfortable  Ed?  This is insanity  They're not getting  a divorce  This is movie shit 
[01:32:30]  I go  What are you doing?  You know the eye  I was just  trying to be helpful  Don't look at the eye  Where's my tissue?  Let me check on the mail  Oh fuck  And she instantly  denies everything  like this is normal  So  I said  You know what?  I'm taking him out  I took him out of the house 
[01:33:00]  He's gone  He's in my house  You're  You're never to be around him  So she would visit him  and you know  pet him  I miss you  And I've never seen  my mom affection  I went  Oh maybe  Maybe she just needed  time  A little time  A little time  Adelance makes the heart  grow fonder  Correct  Yes  And so  about three weeks later  she's  I left her alone  with my father  Oh no  What's going on?  And when  when I came home that day 
[01:33:30]  he's  he's got this  distant look in his eye  Oh no  Like he was captured  by the Japanese  in 44  You'll eat the parakeet meat  This is painful  He's a war vet  He's a war vet  And  right  He survived the war  But now  he's back  in the war 
[01:34:00]  But with my mother  Yeah  With her one eye  And so  she  he goes  I think  I should  I think  I should  go back  to the house  with your mother  I said  Why would  why would  you want  to  He's like  I  I  I should  go back  there  I'm like  what  Alright  So moving back  now  now  you know  a couple  things  she's nasty  a couple  aides  will say  like

[01:37:00]  she needs  other people  to talk to  there's other people  missing eyes  this place is great  there's  people in wheelchairs  sure  she'll make friends  she'll make friends  so with that  go home  and I go  mom  can I just show you  a place  I show her  she loves it  this reminds me  of growing up  in Greenwich Village  oh really  I had the community here  and I'm gonna put  my couch here  she comes with a tape measure 
[01:37:30]  and she's  I'm gonna put my couch here  and the television  in the corner  and  I had a feeling  when I walked in  that  my father said  that you're coming home  so I  oh my god  what about  your poor father  this is what she said  to me  like a sick movie  what about your  poor father  I'll put him  in our house  we're fine  we'll keep the AIDS  now  she's  psycho  because  the pure 
[01:38:00]  hatred  comes from  she has to pay  for the AIDS  now this is  the same person  she's  obsessed  and disturbed  with money  now  let me give you  a little  sickness  about her  and money  background  I pay  her mortgage  I bought  her house  for them  and I have  my house  okay  so I'm paying  through the whole  huge overhead  that's just  that's not  employees and work  right right 
[01:38:30]  that's just my  parents house  and my house  and they're nice  houses  yes  so now  with that said  my dad  his whole life  he had a car  alright  and he couldn't  drive anymore  but he would  always sit in the  driveway  like Gran Torino  he's the Gran Torino  he'd sit there  gooks  and this  look at that  beautiful  if you want to  drive it  go drive it  you know  if you want to  take it to the  store  drive it to the 
[01:39:00]  store  what's that time  when you go in  the city  use your car  don't put mileage  in your car  I just changed  the oil  he would change  the oil  and so  my mom goes  now this is like  a 1980 something  Toyota Camry  if you want the  car  I'll give it to  you for $10,000  Jesus  I went  what  are you  seriously  $10,000  it's yours  so I didn't talk  to her for like 
[01:39:30]  two weeks  what year is it  80 something  honestly I think  it was a 91  and this is like  a couple years ago  10 G's  so she wants  10 G's  almost 10 years old  at this point  right  and she can't  oh no 91  she can't even  drive anymore  so she can't even  drive  you gave me  $10,000  I gave you  the car  okay  so I don't  talk to her  for two weeks  after two weeks  she goes  you know  I'm sorry  about the car  I can 
[01:40:00]  I think  half is fair  I don't  need the car  I don't need the car  I'm fine  I'm good  two weeks later  my sister  from Florida  comes up  who we call  her Crash Patty  great  she's got a lot  of problems  we're just gonna  say that  she's on her  eighth car  and whatever  I don't want  to get into it  we'll be here  for another hour  I can get her  a car for $7,000  so my mom 
[01:40:30]  and this is not  my father's kid  she comes up  I got in an accident  take our car  doesn't ask my father  oh shit  doesn't talk to nothing  all she knows  the car's gone  and then for two months  straight she tries to  well you're senile  and you can drive  the car  that's when he  stopped showering  he stopped  he stopped living  the car meant  everything to him  it was more of the  you'd even talk to me  about it 
[01:41:00]  yeah  so with that  shows her  psychoness  with money  so now  she has to pay  now the AIDS  cost  five grand a month  easy  a little over  five grand a month  and some of them  just sit and text  all day  Jesus Christ  they just  you know  you're paying  just to be there  without thumbs  you're paying  for  just  you know  what are you doing  I'm just checking  messages  yeah  take your father  and so 
[01:41:30]  now I start  going to the house  people are sweating  in the house  come on  what's going on  I can't afford  the god damn  eat  I can't afford  anything  I can't live here  I don't know  what I'm gonna do  I can't live  like this  so ma  I pay  the air  conditioner  I can't  live like this  I'm gonna be  out in the street  in a week  my dad makes  like three grand  a month  from pension  that's how great  is freaking pension  so I'm like  you're paying  two grand a month 
[01:42:00]  you're good  for six years  you're safe  don't worry about it  so a little  more  a little more  and more  this is getting  a little crazier  I hear her  yelling  like the aides  will be putting  my dad in the  toilet  and she goes  you better  shit Jim  or in the  god damn  home you're  going  shit already  it's a war  man  I gotta keep  saying that  and the aide  the lady's like  Mrs. Brewer  I have him 
[01:42:30]  I have him  don't let him  shit on the  god damn  war  cause I ain't  cleaning it  ma you got  a maid  you know  what  so  yesterday  I'm heading  in to do  whatever  showbiz  blah  whatever  freaking  thing  I'm doing  yesterday  I get a  phone call  from  the head  of the agency  that  distributes  the nurses  Jim  I don't know  what happened  today  but 
[01:43:00]  this is  all I can  say  is  you need  to  the first  suggestion  I would  make  is  to  get  all  the  meds  out  of  your  family's  home  cause we  don't  know  what  your  mom  is  doing  to  your  father  what's  going on  I got a  call from the  aides  this morning  saying they  really need to  talk  and they  were very  distraught  and  I 
[01:43:30]  have to  look at  the report  but  it's  something a  little more  serious  especially when  this girl  comes  now this  girl's  a god  sent  she's  god  sent  this  girl  and  she  said  this is  what she  said  she's  like  and to  hear this  woman say  it like  she's in  trauma  she watched  a beating  a mugging  go down  and she's  in full  blown  drama  and she's  like  I've been  doing this  for 15  years  and I've  never seen  this in  my life  and you 
[01:44:00]  know she's  probably been  in the  trenches  man  she's  been  in the  trenches  she takes  care of  Alzheimer's  everyone  she said  she came  over the  house  yesterday  right  and  for some  reason  the garage  door was  open at  my mom's  house  now there's  people working  on the  house outside  in the  development  so  every day  she's  like  I gotta  open the  garage  because  they need  to get  in the  garage  so the  garage  is open  she said  she walked 
[01:44:30]  in the  house  and heard  my father  going  God  stop  stop  stop  and  she  walked  in  and  found  my  mother  like  with  his  pants  were pulled  down  and then  she  turned  and saw  the aid  and so  I'm just  helping  his pants  and then  punched  him in  the stomach  just  pounced  him in  the stomach  right  so  she's  like  what  is  going  on 
[01:45:00]  what  is  like  we're  just  playing  this  is  we're  playing  now  in front  of the  aids  she said  she would  walk  behind  your  father  during  breakfast  and smack  him upside  the head  and go  who's  gonna  take  care  of  you  now  I'm  leaving  you  and then  smack  him  again  and then  she went  in the other  room  to start  making  the report  and start  calling  she didn't  know  who  to  call 
[01:45:30]  she  doesn't  have  they're  not  allowed  to have  cell  numbers  it's  very  involved  so  she's  calling  her  boss  the boss  is not  answering  right away  while  she's  making  the report  she hears  and my  mom  was like  twisting  my father's  arm  and his  skin  is so  light  but everyone  knows  he takes  these drugs  where if  you just  barely  touch  him  he'll  bleed  blood  thinners  right  yes  so  he's  getting  the  open  and  she 
[01:46:00]  walked  in  she  said  and  she  was  pulling  his  ear  and  then  she  went in  she broke  it up  and now  she's  disturbed  of course  now she's  freaked out  I'm freaked  out  she goes  let me  get him  some water  and she  goes  I'll  get him  water  and she  takes  the water  and she  puts her  hands  in the  water  and she  flings  it on  his  face  there's  your  god damn  water  so  like  you  can't  beyond 
[01:46:30]  horrifying  so  with  that  my  sister  goes  up  and now  I  now  I  know  why  he's  got  these  bruises  all  over  his  arm  and  he  said  he  took  the  aid  when  my  mom  went  in  the  room  and  he  said  get  me  out  of  here  holy  shit  get  me  out  of  here  and  so  then  she  immediately  started  calling  everyone  yeah  but she  said  this  was  going  on  for  at least  two  weeks  that  she's  been  there  and  she  said  a couple  days  ago  now  my  dad  almost 
[01:47:00]  he  passed  out  on the  toilet  on the  floor  because  there was  something  wrong  with his  bowel  movement  and  she  gave  him  like  she  said  don't  the  aid  was  like  what  are  you  giving  him  it's  like  I'm  giving  him  a  laxative  and  some  pills  and  she's  like  don't  give  that  to  him  he's  going  to  pissed  and  peed  and  passed  out  and  she  just  sat  there  almost 
[01:47:30]  like  grinning  so  yesterday  we were  going to  call a  cop  so he  can be  there  until  the  aid  showed  up  before  we  got  my  dad  got  him  out  of  the  house  into  my  house  I  called  my  mother  and  I  said  mom  do  you  know  I've  got  four  reports  of  aid  saying  you've  been  abusing  and  hitting  and  punching  dad  and 
[01:48:00]  this  is  the  moment  I'll  never  forget  the  rest  of  my  life  I  had  my  mother  my  whole  life  and  it  was  like  the  most  scary  moment  in  my  life  she  went  I  don't  know  what  you're  talking  about  oh  I  said  ma  are  you  were  you  in  the  room  I  was  in  the  room  and  I  was  helping  your  father  where  is  this  coming  from  mom  you  are  you  saying  you  didn't  hit  you  hit  dad  I 
[01:48:30]  have  reports  saying  you  hit  dad  they  are  making  a  police  report  do  you  understand  that  I  may  have  shook  him  once  in  my  life  but  everyone  is  just  exaggerating  and  I  was  like  you  are  a  fucking  sick  evil  monster  I  don't  even  know  who  you  are  to  hit  a  man  in  a  bed  bed  ridden  to  hit  and  abuse 
[01:49:00]  another  human  in  a  wheelchair  when  I'm  paying  for  you  to  be  gone  and  you  you're  sick  and  she  just  was  hung up  I haven't  talked to  her since  wow  now I'd  love to  call her  right now  and  prank  and  pretend  I'm  the  police  this  whole  uncomfortable  sad  story  turning  to  a  prank  phone 
[01:49:30]  call  so  I  was  thinking  we  can  wow  maybe  she  doesn't  know  she's  doing  it  maybe  oh  no  she  knows  rich  because  she  has  a  past  my  she  has  a  sick  cynical  past  I  was  the  only  child  that  wasn't  abused  and  I  was  the  only  child  out  of  all  of  us  that  wasn't  beaten  and  and  hitting  and  all  that  stuff  we  have  all  has  my  mom  has  my  mom's  like  you'll 
[01:50:00]  find  the  you'll  find  the  joke  in  that  growing  up  I  would  hear  people  say  stuff  like  you  know  black  people  they  got  like  six  fathers  they  don't  know  where  their  father  is  and  our  family  is  black  them  oh  wow  my  sister  is  a  complete  mystery  we  don't  know  and  she's  got  this  scar  on  her  face  that  my  mom  we  always  said  what  what's  the  scar  from  mom  well 
[01:50:30]  when  she  was  the  baby  they  spilled  acid  on  her  by  accident  who  is  they  they  they  ambulance  people  and  who  has  acid  just  laying  around  in  like  the  50s  holy  shit  so  how  are  you  alive  holy  shit  so  to  miss  out  on  some  great  comedy  how  are  you  alive  and  my  sister  literally  went  to  go  have  plastic  surgery  and  you  don't  really  notice  it  because  she's  a  beautiful  person  and  you 
[01:51:00]  just  don't  notice  it  until  she  goes  you  know  the  scar  on  my  face  and  yeah  like  oh  oh  what  and  not  until  last  year  I  realized  it  goes  all  the  way  down  her  neck  and  oh  there's  another  thing  yesterday  the  aide  said  she  goes  I  came  back  at  four  and  I  I  know  your  father  did  not  pee  that  much  but  his  whole  bed  was  wet  his  feet  were  wet  his  clothes  that  was  not  pee  I  I  really  suspect  that  she  was  throwing  water  on  him  and 
[01:51:30]  I  was  like  oh  my  god  are  there  burn  marks  yeah  yeah  are  there  burn  marks  because  he  would  she  was  definitely  capable  boiling  water  and  pouring  on  him  so  he  wasn't  burnt  but  bro  this  is  my  mother  this  is  my  mother  like  where  that's  where  I'm  out of  my  mind  right  now  I  don't  even  know  what  to  do  do  I  hate  her  do  I  forget  I 
[01:52:00]  don't  even  know  where  to  go  right  now  do  you  have  nice  recollections  I  do  yeah  I  do  but  right  now  I'm  just  bad  like  this  happens  in  movies  not  in  my  but  I  will  say  this  whatever  happened  to  baby  Jane  kind  of  stuff  it's  weird  man  so  anyway  she's  still  at the  house  he's  at my  house  and  left  at my  little  six  year old  playing  war  cards  with  him  and  she's  he was  laughing  she was 
[01:52:30]  playing  with him  and  he's  in a  great  environment  thank  god  maybe  we  saved  his  life  a  week  early  who  knows  I  got  the  question  so  what  is  the  problem  between  your  parents  does  she  feel  like  your  dad  did  something  way  back  in the  past  and  now  this  is  no  payback  or  he's  getting  a  he holds  her back  he holds  her back  I think  I don't  know  but for her  whole life  though  and here's  what's  sick  the sick  thing is  she's  got some  anger  in her  about him 
[01:53:00]  but she's  had it  your father  cheated on her  or any of  that shit  never  never  never  he's the  first one  that  didn't  beat her  throughout  her whole  life  every  husband  she got  made lots  of money  so there's  a man  issue  there  every man  made money  and every  man  ended up  beating and  abusing the  kids  so I'm the  only one  that  didn't  happen  to  but again  my sister  they dropped  acid on her 
[01:53:30]  face  they  ass  yeah  they  wait a minute  so why didn't  you sue  you didn't  do that  back then  wait a minute  so you have  a baby  and while  they're delivering  the baby  in the  in  I don't  remember  what  it was so  long ago  uh oh  so then  so we're all  like I think  she did  like me  like who's  her father  I don't  he left  he left  well where is  he  I don't know  I don't know  maybe you went  to jail for this  or something  you'd remember  something like  of course 
[01:54:00]  you did  wouldn't she  remember  no my sister  hunted her dad  down  and she did  find him  but she didn't  want to  she for whatever  reason she stopped  pursuing it  uh she got to  talk to him  like two seconds  and hung up  but because  the the  the plastic  surgeon said  that is a  that's a severe  burn mark  how did the  I need to know  what kind of  burn it was  so she went  to ask my  mother and she  said I don't  know what  happened  it's like 
[01:54:30]  my you don't  know how my  face burned  I don't  know  that's like  a parent  remembers how  a kid like  oh yeah  broke his  finger or  something  that would  be traumatic  hey you know  what she had  you know  my dad's  kids would  come over  and she  squeezed  their arms  squeezed  their heads  talk about  evil they were  yeah man  she's kind  of crazy  now it's all  like coming  back to me  it's all  starting to  come back  I'm so glad  I took  anxiety medicine  before  your mom 
[01:55:00]  I always  thought of  her as just  a sweetheart  she was  she has  that side  to her  where she's  funny  sweetheart  but she's  got this  sick  cynical  dark  evil  side  that I  wow  now I know  why we get  along man  there's some  similarities  there  I think  your mom  has mine  beat  but there's  a lot  of similarities  there  I don't  know many  that don't  have that  beat  so if  you want  she hasn't  taught  but she'll

[02:02:00]  other thing  is like i  would do it  from my  show  because i  i'd do it  right from  my basement  when i'm in  her house  and there was  one time where  i called  and because i  really thought  she might  cheat on him  and i would  call him  flirt pretend  i was a  neighbor  flirting with  her  yeah asking  her out  and she just  wouldn't uh  but at the end  of the day  she wouldn't  date  at 88  huh  this was like  80  this was like  three years ago  so she was 82  and i knew her  whole background  so like hey  doris this is 
[02:02:30]  frank and i  used to work  at pan-american  there you  pan-american  i used to  work at pan-american  that's why i  gave you a call  and when there's  some new great  chinese plays  in town  i love chinese  so do i doris  so do i  and i don't  think we're too  old to at least  you know  have a good  conversation  i believe the  same thing  but i'm married  bring your  husband  bring your 
[02:03:00]  husband  hey it's not  too late  get crazy  right  and i'd strung  her along for  like 45 minutes  before and then  um she finally  was like i don't  know i don't  and she hung up  and called everyone  like this man  keeps calling me  hitting on me  like oh what are  you gonna do  about it i don't  know i don't  know so i  back to your  question i don't  know what i  i don't know  where her  some evil  like you would  think all right  your dad hung in  there his you 
[02:03:30]  know that he  didn't leave her  he would never  say anything but  he would never  trash her so  so he was a  a great influence  on her life  there has to be  a hatred of men  something that she  picked up on that  might not have been  there that she has  been just holding  inside for a long  time wow i try  we gotta call her  either way we have  to i tried that  with bonnie i  pretend i go hi  she goes where  well can we do  we could do this  we can uh if  you're worried  about if you  don't worry  about shit  if you don't 
[02:04:00]  want to well  then here's the  take here's what  i want to ask  because i know  this would be  fine and  confront her  again that'd  be good because  she'll just  totally totally  deny everything  that's the i  can't get it  yeah after  talking to  yesterday or  do i try to  shake her up  as an officer  no you call  and say you're  with yes  you can call  and say you're  with a social  worker  they forced me  to call you  i'm with a  social worker  now and  and then you  play therapist  we just need  is there  right is there 
[02:04:30]  a hatred  because we  under if we  take the if  we take the  approach if we  understand you  right we  understand we  understand this  is this is  this is total  normal that's  the way to do  it let's get  it on the phone  should we take  a break  no because if  we take a break  they're gonna  fucking blow up  yeah listen  i've been at  this a long  fucking time  he's a social  worker  i don't know  if i can pull  it off i'll be  honest i think i  think anthony's  a therapist  no i think if  i think anthony 
[02:05:00]  can pull it off  i'd be the  social worker  and it takes  the lead i  could i could  jump in a  little bit  i'll be the  social worker  and i certainly  can write notes  from past  experience down  but you can  be a therapist  can't you from  your life  yeah all right  well let's let's  just do it  you don't have to  ask as much as  a social worker  yeah let's just  do it  all right let's  go did i give him  the number  yeah i think so  right  oh he's  nervous  i'm nervous  for this one  nervous and i'm  gonna have to be  emotionally ready  because i i can't  get emotionally  involved when she  starts to not i  don't know just  denying the voice of 
[02:05:30]  her going i don't  know what you're  talking about  i do is the it  was like the  cathy bates thing  in that movie it  was the most eerie  feeling down my  spine but at the  same time like this  is my mother  jesus christ i have  greater things to  talk about today  nicer things i was  in amsterdam you  guys are huge in  amsterdam we'll  talk about it  yeah we're huge  all over the world  it's all over the  world it's a parent  at this point it's  weird to have a guy  in amsterdam going  oh my god pizza man  and lars ulrich

[02:11:30]  going on i know okay and now i  have to help you also i i got a  hold of a therapist and a social  worker that i have here with me  hello mrs brewer this is a  william tetley hello hello how are  you okay all right now they both i i  just need to hear the listen i don't  want you to i um deny what has been 
[02:12:00]  done uh i don't buy that you don't  understand what you did to dad i don't  know what i did to him you put your  hands on him i do that all the time  no you hit him  well maybe he was irritating really  bad and i slapped him i might have 
[02:12:30]  yes i might have okay so yesterday  when i asked you if i if you did this  you lied to me and you said i did not  hit him  i don't remember doing it jimmy i don't  remember doing it oh mom you're as  clear as day i do not buy that you're  clearly lying you are clearly lying and  you need to face what you're doing  yesterday you told me i may have shook  him now you just told me i may have  slapped his face i don't know oh no i 
[02:13:00]  didn't slap his face you'd slap his  head  you pull his ears  i don't um this is written down in  reports  i may have pulled his ears fooling  around but i never pulled his ears  that's not you know you and i when he's  screaming to say stop  um there's reports that you would put  down the water and throw it in you you dip  your hands give it yesterday poke in the  back of his head 
[02:13:30]  what why this is what i want to ask  you  what is it that drives you to do that  i let's say he was annoying you how is  he annoying you laying in a bed  what makes you enter the bedroom and  attack him while someone is being paid  to take care of him and all you have to  do is stay out of his room you what was 
[02:14:00]  your purpose entering that room i don't  remember  you do remember and you're going to tell  me  i don't so you just wandered aimlessly  and said oh i'm in the bedroom now  no he must have said something he must  have said something or he did say  something  i don't know so why would you have to  remember you have never had a memory  loss in your life i know that for a fact  you know that for a fact you are not 
[02:14:30]  alzheimer's and you do not have  dementia  you are clear as day so i need you to  explain to me and the social worker  and the therapist who are also reading  the reports i'm trying to help you here  so this doesn't get uglier and what i  need to know is to hear you and you're  not getting trouble i need you to vent  what made you go in the room what was  your initial purpose he might have been 
[02:15:00]  yelling at the girl he might the girls  were not there yet  well then he would he was yelling for me  to come in and i i can't get him up  but you know you can't get him up and  you've been saying this for a year  ready  and thus matter of fact the bed you can't  get him up and the bed is made so he  can't even get out of bed no matter who's  there unless an aide is there you know  that and i know that so please again explain to me why you would go in the room if he has because i have to see what he wants to me okay what did he want i don't remember he probably wanted to pee he probably wanted to pee so you just you remember going in the room and you think maybe he wanted to pee and i get the urinal for him if that's what it was okay i can't get his thing in the urinal and he can't get it in the urinal and he can't get it in the urinal 
[02:15:30]  okay so that frustrated you  i guess that's frustrating 
[02:16:00]  yes and again it goes all over  but then why would you hit him  i don't know why i hit him  but you do but you do uh hit him uh mrs brewer  once in a while if he if he gets an issue with me  do you think do you think that's right to hit a uh a man that's uh bedridden um mrs brewer  no i know it's not right but sometimes  it gets you  you can't come  you just can't control your emotions anymore  uh i i think you have some deep-seated anger issues 
[02:16:30]  uh i've read the reports by the way  and uh there is uh definite bruising and and signs of uh physical uh abuse to this man  and um  this this has to stop what what where do you think this comes from  uh in in your past i i've talked to jim  about your past and uh uh you know different men uh is there a hatred towards men in general  that you're harboring  no 
[02:17:00]  no  could it be just that is it the money  that that you feel that he's  you know the aids are causing  anguish from your bank account maybe  i'm worried about it yeah  but does that cause  because where i'm confused mom is  you seem to be happy in the place that you're going to be going  and i need to hear an honest opinion from you 
[02:17:30]  if you've been not telling me the truth  because what i got from you is  this is a great thing and i can't wait to do this  and i thought we were all in a great place  and is that true so far  yeah  okay  so here you are going  okay  i'm gonna go away  my son  is gonna pay for it  besides the two mortgages he has  and everything else he does  living on the road and all that  and he's gonna put and take care of his mother here 
[02:18:00]  and his father  no i'm taking care of your father  well you're taking care  actually dad's taking care of from the pension he makes  the pension don't cover it yeah  it covers three quarters of it  yeah just about  right  but wouldn't you fairly say  for the years of him being home  taking care of your children  such as patty and and myself  and never hitting you  and never abusing you  like some of the abuse you had in the past 
[02:18:30]  that maybe this man  might be worth some of that  oh yes i think he's worth it  you sure  but don't forget  i took care of my children too  i worked every day  so did he  three jobs i remember  no one's denying that  i remember my father being the sanitation  janitor and bartender  all at the same time  right  yeah  so i remember both you working  i remember that  clears a day 
[02:19:00]  mrs brewer  yes  i read in one of the reports that you were  uh... smacking your husband's ears  uh... this is  very strange to me  he got up one morning and said he couldn't hear  i didn't know if he was fooling  or if he meant it  now i know i'm a gentleman of his advanced years  wouldn't you assume that he meant it and and this wasn't a joke and  and then to  to take the palms of your hands  and smash them into his ears 
[02:19:30]  uh... does not seem like uh... a thing to do that would be uh... healthy for  for this gentleman  well he kept laughing at it and we thought he was a fooling  from what i've heard and and read in the reports he did not find this funny  well i don't know  mom  yeah  um...  i need to know  where your violent streak comes from  because you clearly 
[02:20:00]  got worse  the minute you got your place  and  it seems to come out of uh...  uh... almost like a childlike  ha ha ha ha ha  and  i just  everyone here is baffled  and i didn't think i'd  we'd be in this situation  where i have to tell people  she's 85  and  let  i now have places  concerned about you going there  to live  afraid you'll lash out 
[02:20:30]  to a neighbor  or someone else  because if you're  if you are  capable of doing what you've done  which you clearly  won't admit  is wrong  and you clearly  will not even apologize for  but rather just  try to find  reasoning for it  then there is a major issue  if i  if i  i will apologize  to him  i don't think it's healthy for you to even see him right now  because i don't believe i 
[02:21:00]  i won't believe your apology because it's more to just clear your air  it's not a true apology it's just to say  hey  i'm cool  and and  this is where we're at right now i don't  we need to find out  if  if at the end of the day you said  you know what  i'm not going to lie to you jim  i hate your father  or  i'm not going to lie to you  uh  i hate him for what i can understand  to  somewhat degree  i don't hate him 
[02:21:30]  i don't understand where the violence come from you clearly go out of the way  to attack him at times  right there's there's absolute violence  and from what i'm hearing here it's uh  excuses and  and oh it was a joke and it was this you're not taking responsibility  for the fact that you're physically abusing a bedridden wheelchair bound man  where does that come from  i don't know  but you but you do assume it comes from somewhere  it must come from somewhere 
[02:22:00]  well you have to have some idea  of where it might come from  can you  reach back perhaps  and  no i can't  and really think  when did this start  how long ago  i don't know  i don't remember  it's a lot i don't remembers  you don't remember yesterday  but then you do remember  you don't remember hitting him  but then you do remember hitting him  you need to talk mom  i don't know what to say  okay 
[02:22:30]  well you're gonna have to really think about  what you've done  because  there's a lot of eyes on you right now  and it's not healthy right now  and you have no clue  the circumstance that you put everyone in  it's very uncomfortable  for everybody  i realize that  i'm uncomfortable too  you're uncomfortable  you're uncomfortable  jim's not gonna let you see your husband  is what he's saying  i can't  he's petrified 
[02:23:00]  the thought of you  petrifies him  he wasn't petrified when he left yesterday  oh  when he got to the house  he would not eat  and he kept saying  is she coming here  is she coming here  do i have to go back  the reports  that were made  by not one  but three  different  aids that came there  are quite frankly  i 
[02:23:30]  my spine is chilled mom  that  i'm chilled  i'm really chilled  and i  i don't even know  i'm beside myself  i really don't  i love you my mother  but i i don't know if i even know you right  i'm very disturbed  i am too  because  yeah but you did it  so how  that that is  i can say  i hit my daughter  why'd i hit my daughter  well 
[02:24:00]  she  i asked her to do this  she was disrespectful  she  i asked her not to  and she repeated  and then she lashed out  and she hit  so i spanked her on the butt  i i  and then i go  the emotions got the best of me  but you clearly  go out of your way  to go after him at times  indictive it sounds like  yeah  so  now let me ask you this  um  one of the reports said 
[02:24:30]  they're pretty confident  that  probably yesterday  there's no way  he could have peed  the amount of water  that was in the bed  and they really think  you might have just thrown  what did you  oh i did not  that's ridiculous  i'm just asking  i'm just asking  now hasn't there been  episodes in the past  where she has thrown water  at uh... your father  no the reports were  she would dip her hands  in the water  mm-hmm  and it's in in a in a uh... 
[02:25:00]  you know condescending way  and then spritz it in his face  would this happen mrs brum  i don't remember doing that either  you don't remember a lot i i've noticed  she doesn't remember a lot of things  you know we  we  but and you said there's no alzheimer's  or dementia  no none whatsoever  she's clear as day  so how come you don't remember  so much when  when when these episodes  are going on  where you're clearly abusing  your your husband  i don't know  but i  definitely didn't throw water  in the bed  i was the one that said to him  my god  it's like soaking wet 
[02:25:30]  okay  now would that be crazy to think  that you may have done  something like that  when in fact we've heard stories  why would i do that  well we  why would you  why would you hit him  why would you  why'd you pull his ears  grab his poke him  arms  to the point where they're bruised  i mean there's  physical evidence of abuse here  i don't know  i mean we could we  we just want to  we just want to understand  so do why  we just want to understand  where this is coming from 
[02:26:00]  why there's so much  uh... uh...  hatred  it seems  inside you  i don't know  you have to know  you have to  i don't  you have no clue  no  is there a resentment  that you have to your  husband that  no  no  there has to be a little  mom which is okay  and understandable  i don't think so  do you feel angry because 
[02:26:30]  you think he's leaving you  behind  because he went to jimmy's  yes  yes  no  or he might  or he might be moving on  and you feel  that you're going to be  left alone and there's  anger towards that  uh... no because i know i  won't be here that long  to be left alone  that he's following me on twitter  and you're not  i can't hear you  nothing  yeah i i don't understand  so  um  i guess we'll  that was dr van nostrum  he's a uh 
[02:27:00]  the uh  therapist  yes  all right  well  i would just think about  things  um  i don't even know where to  i don't even know where to go  because you  like i said  you clearly will not take action  you will not take responsibility  what you clearly know you did  and  and you're pretending like you don't know  and  you're innocent  and you don't know what's going on  you know what's going on  you know what's going on  you know what's going on  how 
[02:27:30]  how hard do you hit him  not that  if i hit him not that hard  how  not that strong  but it does  it feels good though inside doesn't it  huh  it feels good inside though  no not really  takes a little that stress away  maybe it's a stress release  maybe it's a stress release  give him a pop  maybe it's that i don't know  and when you hit someone it just feels good  you know it's wrong but it just feels good 
[02:28:00]  are we onto something  huh  are we onto something  no i i just  i mean you're  you're  i've been uh studying this for  forty years and  and  and you know you're in a tough spot  obviously  it can't be easy to have an elderly  husband  that you have to take care of  and  i'm an elderly woman  but you're  you're more with it with  than uh  your husband is certainly  and it must just feel  it's just a  a relief 
[02:28:30]  to maybe uh  lash out  i i think we could  agree with that right  yes  so how hard do you hit him  huh  how hard  yeah  not hard  do you try to hold back or  or you give a you know  you give it a hundred percent  no never a hundred percent  i'm not that strong  seventy eighty percent  maybe fifty percent if anything  yeah i understand  we've seen this before 
[02:29:00]  it's not easy though right  to take care of them  to take care of them  no it's not easy  but i do it  and sometimes you just gotta lash out  because you don't know what else to do right  yeah  yeah  so that's where it comes from  you think  i guess so yeah  okay  do you think he deserves that  no 
[02:29:30]  and you're you think of yourself as a rational human being right  not completely at times  well obviously at those times that's not rational behavior  no it's not  why do you continue doing it  i don't know  we need we need answers here  well we've learned  we don't want it we don't want to take this to the next step  we've learned it's a relief  it's a it's a stress relief  it's a stress relief  but this is what i also told you mom  do you remember  and i know you remember this 
[02:30:00]  i looked at you and i said mom  when you're frustrated  when you're mad  when you want to lash out  call me  any time  of the day  and this was just a couple days ago  and you said okay  you know  what do you mean i went  you know what i mean  yeah but i can't call you  any time of the day  no see but the 
[02:30:30]  what i'm trying to explain to you is  you have openings  and you have offers  to approach  these emotions you have  before you lash out  i gotcha  you have  other things to do to lash out  and when you can't control yourself  from lashing out  whether it's pulling his ears  whether it's screaming at him  whether it's shoving his head  whether it's poking his head 
[02:31:00]  whether it's giving him a smack  no matter what it is  you have to find another means  of venting that frustration  i gotcha  have you ever  punched him in the balls  i ever what  hit him in the balls i don't think  no  but that you've seen that before doctor  oh yes i have  okay  everything you do for him  no i i just think he doesn't know where he is 
[02:31:30]  yeah  okay  can't be easy  we understand that the it can't be easy part certainly  we've seen this  but you can't hit him 50%  he's an old  he's an old man  i realize that  let me ask you this  what do you think is the best way  to resolve  everything right now 
[02:32:00]  i don't know maybe keep him over there and i'll go visit him  i'm talking  what do you say doctor  that's not going to happen anytime soon  there's too much denial here  we're hearing way too much denial  that's what i'm saying  we really need to get everything out on the table  exactly what has been going on the last few years  and then we can get past this  you're talking to a bunch of  people here that understand  the situation  but until you put it all on the table  we can't move forward with this  we cannot allow you to visit him anytime soon 
[02:32:30]  so what i'm saying is  i'll give you some time  but just like  just like  i'm not saying you are  just like a criminal  that gets caught  stealing something  we'll take someone in our family  okay  then we all know who  i don't have to go into names  and there was a time  where the car was taken  they were in your house 
[02:33:00]  and everyone denied everything  do you remember that feeling of the denial  yes  and how frustrating  and we all knew  and not only  did that person deny it  and they were a different person back then  we all know that  but even  the the family members of that person  was i don't know what you did  they went on attack mode  it's the  until that person  finally said  wow  i can't believe what i did 
[02:33:30]  and they really meant it  and really acknowledged  why they did it  is when that human being moved on in life  you have to find that  because you still  have not  accepted  or you have not acknowledged  what you've done  or what you do  well jim let's try to find out what she's willing to admit  Dr. Vandele  you might as well continue 
[02:34:00]  what are you willing to admit today  you said  you've hit him numerous times at 50%  I'm assuming if you  you're admitting to 50%  it's probably more like 60 to 75%  of your full strength  what else are you willing to admit today  i admit that he frustrates me sometimes  have you thrown water on him  not the flicking but  full cups of water  maybe a pot of water  no  okay  that's ridiculous  have you slapped his ears quite hard to the point where he 
[02:34:30]  may have yelled at  I did when he said he couldn't hear  and he kept fooling around  we didn't know if he could or he couldn't  how hard have you pulled his ears  not that hard  well reports say differently  yeah we're not going to get anything accomplished  she's still in denial about the whole thing  and from what I hear  we've been briefed  and from what we hear there is a history  that could date back to some of your children's history 
[02:35:00]  that a lot of questions are being asked about  certain people siblings of Jim's  and what has happened to them in the past  perhaps abuse things like this such  you know what I'm getting at  no I don't know  you've been confronted in the past with  maybe scarring  maybe what 
[02:35:30]  I thought maybe you'd be able to tell me  how about abusing abuse of the children  are you around to watch the children being beaten as they were growing up  I never beat my children  I'm not saying you personally  I'm just saying have you seen the children being beaten by men that you have brought home  yes I have  and you stood by and did what?  no I didn't sit by  I attacked  she did attack 
[02:36:00]  oh yeah  let me write that in my report  I want to put a check mark there  why don't we do this  just think about  where a lot of this comes from  thank you  and I want you to really think about  because  between you and me ma  you know  now  places want to know if you're  they just want to know if like you're a potential threat around other people 
[02:36:30]  and I try to explain you won't be  but  we have  it's reports now  so I'm just telling you  you need to come to a point  and you need to acknowledge  and you need to vent  you know  you were talking to that pastor for a while  and you were letting a lot out  maybe you lost some of that  I don't know  I remember you at a different place  but you need to find something  I don't know if you pray 
[02:37:00]  whatever it is  you need to find it  alright  okay  alright we'll talk to you soon  do you concur  Dr. A.G. Pennypacker?  sure why not  yes  ok  thank you  thank you mom  you're welcome  bye  wow  dude I was  you scared me  I didn't want to  wholly uncomfortable  now here's what's funny  I didn't want to go anywhere with that  well no there's heavy heavy stories 
[02:37:30]  and the book  when she passed away  that book will be written  oh really  and it's heavy  and it's dark  but the past  she left one night  gathered up the kids  after her  it's such a long story  she lived in freaking Brazil  with this rich guy from Pan Am  holy shit  had a maid  but at the same time  the guy would come home  beat her  get into the kids  his own kids  and then one night  as my brother describes 
[02:38:00]  taking a gun  and shooting  trying to kill her  out in the street  running around the car  they would hide at night  with knives  waiting for him to come home  trying to kill him  while he was sleeping  this is fucking crazy  oh dude you have no clue  I asked my sister one time  what was the  you know what  you're just kind of like  hey man what's the best time  you ever had in your life  and my sister  the one with the scars  said  the night we ran away from home 
[02:38:30]  and we got a hotel  somewhere in North Carolina  that was the best sleep  I ever had in my life  just one night  of being able to just  not worry  and I  I'm so naive of this  because I never got any of this  I would hear my dad badger  I would hear my mom  go like  you're so stupid  and your kids  ain't getting my  god damn money  and don't think  so I would watch that  and I had some anger towards  any chick 
[02:39:00]  that would like  attempt  to talk me down  they were immediately  out of the relationship  because I'd see my mom  coming out so  your dad's kids too  my dad has kids  from his first  his first marriage  and you know he was a heavy drinker  when he was younger  and he just came out  they came out of World War II  and they're like  here's some  go start some kill  yeah yeah get a family  go get a family  and he spread your seed  you gotta get the population back  from the guys  that died in the war  yeah it's sort of like  the Iraqi and Afghanistan 
[02:39:30]  no one's acknowledging them  when they come home  yeah  I mean Jimmy will tell you  Norton  when we went to the Pentagon  I'm still shaking up  from that day  that these kids  kids  with no legs  and no arms  and they're sucking in a tube  and here's the wife  who has three kids  and she's starting to get resentful  and you know  what do they get from the government  hey listen  thank you  so let's go to Britney Spears  and damn what's going on  with Tom Cruise  hey 
[02:40:00]  Eddie Murphy  no one gives a shit  no one gives a shit  so  you know  of course they're gonna drink heavy  or of course they're gonna start doing drugs  or kill themselves  or whatever  but  so  yeah  he probably drank the shit out of himself  and so  his second marriage was my mom  which I truly think  she trapped him  because  she was in the middle of  whatever  because  they never got married 
[02:40:30]  it was a full blown accident  and my mom was in between  him and another guy  which my kid  which my side explains  and then  my stepbrothers  and then  see I brought  when she said she never hit her kids before  she never hit me  but my brother will clearly say to this day  he goes  when I was 16  she smacked me for the last time  mm-hmm  for the last time  and I grabbed her arms  and I said  you will never  touch me again  touch me again 
[02:41:00]  and then as soon as he was 17  he took off and never came back home  wow  he went to the mountains  he didn't even have electricity  he just left  so  I don't know  I'm waiting  it's gonna be a great movie  great book  but  it's just  it's wild man  did you see that?  did you hear the  you put us in a bad position  because I didn't know how far we could take it  well  so I went with the ball  I got scared  and then it's going with the scar thing  great derby  we were holding back 
[02:41:30]  but I knew  we were holding back  because I don't know  I didn't know where she'd go with the scar  but I knew the miss she denied going  I never hit my kids  and I went  alright she's  she ain't going nowhere  she ain't going nowhere  let's just end this now  dude  isn't that crazy?  that's fucking  wow  the whole like just  I don't remember  I don't remember  I don't know  that's an easy way out of shit  in my own life  I've heard that a million fucking times  like just fucking admit some shit  instead of this 
[02:42:00]  I don't remember  I didn't do this  that is very odd  and the whole like  I don't  that's psychotic  no offense  yeah the  it's psychotic  is she on meds?  I don't remember  she does do meds  but  it's  I'm telling you  I've seen her  it has nothing to do with  meds  it's just  she has this deep  we were joking  we were joking  I was joking  cracking him in the ear  he thought it was funny  cracking him in the ears  it's 
[02:42:30]  it's weird  I don't know how to relate  what do you think?  she's so frustrated  that she gets a little frustration out?  uh  you nailed it doctor  I think she's living in fear  fear?  of what though?  fear of abandonment  and being alone  when he passes away  yeah  you could be right  yeah  well you know what Rich  she  I know  she definitely  yeah  she definitely has that  deep deep fear  because she often  will say  she's bringing up money  you're right 
[02:43:00]  no he's right though  dude  why?  sorry  you gotta keep it funny  you gotta keep the funny  cigars and scotch rights  maybe Jim's parents  discovered S&M late in life  and your father forgot  forgot the same word  oh shit  or you stumbled upon it  they've been doing it their whole lives  what?  that's brutal  sorry  he might have been right  he might be right  he might be right  oh my gosh  give me what's the same word  oh shit 
[02:43:30]  you forgot  but no Rich you're right  she lives in fear  of him dying  and all that  but the whole like  does she still love him?  I don't know  I  I don't know  I get  I don't know  I don't know  like the beating  is a fear  I don't know  where's the beating  and the hitting  come from?  and the screaming  it is fear  don't leave me  stop  don't leave me  that's what you see  Steven Texas has a good one too 
[02:44:00]  I don't know  I'm not a doctor  put your headphones on  I think Rich is right  you know please  it's like when you're  please don't  you're pounding so much heart  to keep him going  keep him going  don't leave me you son of a bitch  don't leave me  don't leave me here with all this  Steven Texas  don't have time to go to him  he says  she absolutely remembers  when she didn't do something  this is where  something's going on  yet doesn't remember  doing things  so what does that mean?  well if you call her out  on something  she goes I absolutely 
[02:44:30]  didn't do that  and then you call  right  and then she'll go  I don't remember  right  I don't remember Jimmy  I don't remember  it's like when I would ask Norman  I used to know when Norman lied  cause he'd go eh  so she kept going  come on  did you hear him?  yeah  what's that?  where'd I hear him?  I don't remember  I don't remember  yeah  so yeah  that's when I thought  it was amazing  she'd go absolutely  that's ridiculous  there's no way  where everything else was  I don't remember  I don't remember Jimmy 
[02:45:00]  it's a typical  that's creepy  that's Kathy Bates shit  I don't remember  yeah yeah right  it's the typical like  um  criminal  where like  where were you that night?  you're also talking to an 85 year old lady  it's different when you go  when a 45  or a 40 year old man goes  I don't remember  both  an 85 year old lady has a lot  she's got so much shit going through her fucking head right now  no you're right  Rich is actually making me feel better  but if there was so many  she's got you know going into a home  losing her house  her husband's gonna pass away  right 
[02:45:30]  there's a lot of shit going through her head  right  at 85 where  there's things that she cannot remember  Rich is talking from experience  I'm telling you  she remembers  no I  I believe you as far as the fear  plus his old joke  and she's  petrified  and that could block out  some of her memory  I don't believe it blocks out  I'm not  she remembers  well I'm not saying that attacking is right  but there is stuff that's gonna escape her  but  the other side of this  how many things do you forget in life?  I don't forget the traumatic  okay but you forget things 
[02:46:00]  right  I don't remember every person I punched and kicked  clearly  hard  I get what you're saying  I get what you're saying  here's what I'll buy  I buy the  it comes from the fear  I think you nailed it with the  don't leave me  don't leave me  god damn it don't leave me  because  this brings up an interesting point  her first love  she got married  pregnant  he was shipped to World War II  and killed 
[02:46:30]  two days for  two months before  the war ended  oh fuck  so then  her father  her  her anchor in life  died  a year and change later  and then  her grandfather  two years after that  and then  the only thing that kept her  to her  childhood memory  and the ex-husband  that died  that still to this day  is her love of a life  was my oldest brother  who died 
[02:47:00]  a little over ten years ago  and that just  destroyed her  everything she's loved  everything she has loved  the real love  anything she has truly loved  was ripped away from her  so  yeah there's some abandonment  stuff going on there  wow  I think it's from abandonment  wow  wow let's call her again  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  but no but you  you helped me  um  be able to  talk to her  and be like listen  I get the abandonment  and uh 
[02:47:30]  now can you help me  we're here for you  now can you help me get back  into improvs  Voss you ass  no thank you Voss  that was awesome  your twitter comment was really good too Rich  very good  the twitter thing  Jesus Christ  that is twitter  enough with the twitter  does my mother blackouts  no  uh  yeah why doesn't Jim get a nanny cam  well it's over now  yeah  cause he's in my house  you should have teddy bears all over that fucking place  oh god  oh I should  I should  but

[03:00:30]  And they don't even cook the burgers by the way  They make the patties and chop meat  And they spray paint them the brown color of meat  Yeah  And then they burn the grill marks in  Yeah  With a hot poker thing  Wow  And yeah, the lettuce is really leafy  And just on the front  So it doesn't make the whole bun pop off  You know, if you put lettuce on a burger  It wilts and looks like shit  Yep  It still tastes alright  So of course the burger can't be heated up  If you want the lettuce to look fresh too  Yeah, so they don't want everything guilty  It's all a clever rouge  Yes  Clever rouge  And they can't wait for it to cool off  Cause then the burger will look like shit 
[03:01:00]  So they just never cook it  That's a few of the tricks  I forgot  Fucked up  There's a few others  They spray paint the vegetables  To make them look, you know  Brighter  Crisper and better  Yeah, yeah  Oh no  But stupid Yakov doesn't know this  Cause his meat looks horribly grey  Look at that  What a country  It's horrible  Grey meat  What a country  In Soviet Union we had meat that was blue  Aha, what a country  Shut up  He's making a lot of money, man  For a fucking hat comic  He figured it out 
[03:01:30]  But no one hears of him outside of Branson  You don't give a fuck  I know  Where is Branson?  Why did he pick Branson?  Missouri  Branson, Missouri turned into like this fucking  I don't know how  I don't know the history of Branson  But it turned into the Vegas of the fucking Midwest  Oh is it? Okay  Yeah, it's a huge fucking place that rubes go to  Yeah, it's a low budget Vegas  Yeah, like people from New York and LA  You wouldn't be caught dead there  But the Midwest  It's perfect  It's fucking giant  God, I want to go there  Are there hotels there? 
[03:02:00]  Oh yeah, hotels, shows  They got like  What other places are there?  The Hollywood Wax Museum  Silver Dollar City  Whitewater Walsing Waters  The Titanic Museum  What other celebrity?  The celebrity  Ripley's Oddity  Ripley's fucking Believe It or Not stores blow  You don't like the Believe It or Not?

What?  Want to learn about Branson?  A little bit  Alright hold on man  Let's say hi to Larry  Let's see the rest of that fucking Yakup dinner thing  Larry  Larry  Hi 
[03:03:30]  Hello boys  Hello  My oldest brother's wife  My mom and one of my other brothers and nephew  They went on the way to Texas  Stopped in Branson  Man the shows are expensive  It's hard as hell to get in  I mean their places are packed  They absolutely pack them in their places  Yeah I don't doubt it  I mean you know  Think about what a lot of the country is you know  They love that shit  I mean we're rubes  I mean goodness sakes  We live in the middle of nowhere 
[03:04:00]  I mean we're rubes  Rubes  I can't help it  I was born a rube  I was raised a rube  I'll die a rube  And you went down there though  And did you see a show?  I just haul freight down there  I go down there  Oh  He can't get in  He can't afford the show  You can't afford the shows?  I'm like  Well no it's not that  I'm in a big rig  Where the hell am I going to put my 18 wheels?  Ah well  He's talking on Main Street there in Branson  Chuckers love to talk though  Yeah I know  He's a little lonely right now  Yeah  Thank you sir 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  Family great  Thanks for the family  Oh Jimmy  Alright  Thank you sir  Let's go to Yakov's dinner adventure  Let's see  There's a  Soleil in Las Vegas  And this was better  Join us  Okay  She says  I'm sorry we're going to have to stop this a bunch  She might be telling the truth  In Vegas  Chuck was okay  In Vegas  I've seen three of their shows  They're fucking amazing  You loved them  I can't imagine  Amazing  I saw one in Disney  And I saw one in  I forgot where else 
[03:05:00]  Oh the Bahamas somewhere  Down there  I didn't like the water one as much  But it was still amazing  But you cannot fucking tell me that  That the one in Branson, Missouri  During Yakov Smirnoff's fucking dinner adventure  Is going to be better than the one in Vegas  They're probably swinging minorities from the ceiling  That's why they all love it  But stupid Yakov is making it sound like you see all this during his show  I think this is just a general thing of what you see  Oh I think this is Yakov's dinner adventure, sir  I think this is all exclusive to Yakov's dinner adventure 
[03:05:30]  Wow  Okay  Yeah  Alright  It's under the banner of Yakov's dinner adventure  Alright, a lot of big acts  Let's see  This is probably one of the best  I paid more to see Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas  And this was better  Join us for a magnificent show experience  And a mouth-watering, fun-filled dinner  Fun-filled dinner  Alright, could you go back to the mouth-watering  Fun-filled dinner  Fun-filled dinner  I want to see  Alright, here we go  They get the people participating  It's the same food, but he just rotated  He rotated the platter a little bit  That looks awful 
[03:06:00]  Like a muffin in the middle  Could he, by the way, have put it on a worse tablecloth?  Yeah  What the fuck is that?  It looks like oldie estate-type wallpaper  It looks like the fucking rug Nicholson was dancing on  When he got a little bit of avocado spilled on his jacket  Avocado  Yes, it's the ballroom fucking carpet  Of the Overlook  Look at the tiny tray  And then, you know what else?  It makes me uncomfortable  They probably gotta show, by law, they have to show what you're gonna get  Yeah  They give you water with a slice of lemon  Yeah, well 
[03:06:30]  No beverage  Well, that's where they make their money  On beverages?  I would bet money  Yeah, it's 40 bucks a clip for this fucking thing  I would bet money though, no fucking wine or beer  No  That's separate  Beer is $300 a glass  Oh, I don't doubt it  What a country  What a country  He's right  Let's see what happens with the  Because I think I saw some audience participation  Which is the best part of any show  Or maybe that's a big fucking glass of vodka  Vodka  So you can sit through this shit  Yakov, being Russian, would love his vodka  Vodka  Vodka  Vodka  Alright, let her rip  Let me see 
[03:07:00]  Fun-filled dinner that you and your family will never forget  We love the patriotism  I want us  Go to America  All the shows we've seen, this was one of the best  Well, we came back a second time  It's a new breath of fresh air in here  I think it's wonderful  I think the Moscow Circus gave us a chance to laugh  Participate with audience participation  With the balls and the balloon  And brought a tear to my eye at the conclusion  It just had so much truth to it  It was wonderful  Oh, boy 
[03:07:30]  What an incredible story  They're doing it in front of the Statue of Liberty  Yes, with an American flag  This is so douchey  Imagine having to sit through this shit  These fucking boobs all think it's patriotic  Yeah, this forced patriotism  A breath of fresh air, there's no fucking way  It's just a bunch of 85-year-olds just farting  Yeah, fresh air  Farting out that bad meat farts  From Yakov's platter  Horrendous the farts are in that place  Oh, God  There'll be a breath of fresh air  A fucking tsunami coming through  This is terrible 
[03:08:00]  Let's see what else happens  This is what we have to look forward to when we get older, right?  Yeah  This shit is  And they're all old people  Oh, my God  It's the Osmond brothers  But you gotta think that there was a time they were young doing their thing  And now this is what we have to look forward to when we get older, right?  Yeah  Fuck  The whole story was an emotional thing for me  I mean, I just got literally tears in my eyes  I was expecting good Russian dancing as it was wonderful  But what I wasn't expecting  Pause it, please  Oh, boy 
[03:08:30]  The Osmonds  The man's head is being attacked by a carpeting  Now, there are three of the Osmond brothers there  Two of them are completely white hair  Well, they've decided to let time do its thing  Right  The one looks exactly like Donny Osmond as an old guy  Yeah  That's creepy  There's one on the left, though, that refuses  He's wearing the worst wig ever  It's terrible  Ever  With the darkest color  I don't even think Just For Men makes that color  No, no  Who the fuck did he get that color?  That is a wig on his head 
[03:09:00]  The famous soy sauce, I guess  Yeah, soy sauce  He's got a goatee that is fucking dark  Yeah  That color is black squared  What a fucking horrendous rug that is  Horrid  He's gotta be at least 65  Yeah  What is he doing?  His brothers are doing it right  Just letting fucking time do its toll  Oh, boy  I got a tear in my eye  In my eye  I realized how much I paid for this garbage  By the photogs  Through your tears  He is  Yeah  That's stupid Bruce Kelly 
[03:09:30]  I can't help it  But what I wasn't expecting  That it just blew my mind away  It was just the effects  The fire  The bubbles  The unicide  There's a big drop off  Didn't he just say the effects?  The grown man said the fire  And the bubbles  They couldn't  The effects  They were the smallest bubbles ever  With a little flame of like flash paper on the stage  Which  And then somebody blowing bubbles out of a fucking big hoop 
[03:10:00]  Right  On the stage  Those are effects  No, it wasn't a big hoop  It was a little hoop  Make sure you pause when the bubbles pop up  But what an idiot to say and the bubbles  Who says and the bubbles  That was the second thing that came to mind with the effects  Right  Fire and then the bubbles  I'm saying that when these three are taking a bath  What's coming up from his fucking mouth and nose  As the water's turning black from his wig  The effects  Even the fire  The bubbles  That's tiny bubbles  That's the worst 
[03:10:30]  Jesus  What is wrong with these people?  Who is going to this?  The bubbles  Who would edit this and go  Yeah, we're talking about the big special effects  And then they leave the little bubbles in  The bubbles  Like the guy just with a regular bubble thing  That he just blew  The bendy pencil  Right  When he has the pencil between his fingers  I thought it was a rubber pencil  This makes the fucking Greg Brady show  Look like Siegfried and Roy  Oh, they're saying it might be a dry town  That's why no alcohol with the den  What?  I'm pretty sure Branson's a dry town  What? 
[03:11:00]  Tommy says  Are you kidding?  Let's go to Tommy  Well, it's probably like very Christian down there, right?  I would assume a lot of Christianity and patriotism  Uh, Tommy  Hey guys, I got dragged there  I was abroad for the year  My parents booked a vacation when I came home  And I got dragged to Branson, Missouri  The place is effing dry  It's dry, huh?  Yeah, I'm punching out, boys  Alright  No, they are not a dry city  I just looked at them  They're not  Is Branson, Missouri a dry county?  Uh, as you can see  As in can you have or do they serve alcohol in Branson, Missouri? 
[03:11:30]  Answer, no, they are not a dry city  Okay  So they're a dry city?  No, they are not  But he said it was  Apparently it says  No, they're not a dry city  They are cracking down on the liquor stores for selling alcohol to underage drinkers  But they are not a dry city  Oh, uh-huh  Alright  Uh-huh  Let's uh, let's uh  Oh, please, please  I need more  Yakov  Let's try a unicycle  And what was that thing that was going?  That  Human slinky 
[03:12:00]  Unbelievable  My favorite part was the human slinky  Our favorite part was the slinky  Yay!  The human slinky was just amazing  What's amazing?  I'm passionate about this show  I love what they do  It was, it looks like a prolapsed antel  You know what the human slinky is?  Us in the air conditioning business  No, that is what is called about a 16 inch diameter flex pipe that you use to connect your return grills in  And you crawl inside it and flap it around like your arms and legs 
[03:12:30]  And that's it  That's it!  That's all it is!  And it's spray painted rainbow colors  To make it look like a slinky  Yeah, but it's not  It's pretty amazing ant  No, it isn't  I agree with the  It's the most  I agree with the Osmond brothers  It's pretty amazing  It's the most unimpressive bit of like that wacky kind of stage weirdness that you go like  Wow, that looks weird, how do they do that?  It's way better than the blue man group  It's stupid  No, I don't think so  I fucking hated the blue man group  What do you think of those apples?  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do  On the fucking PVC pipe  Was that the blue man group or the other ones?  That blue man group 
[03:13:00]  Oh  They do that  I don't even remember  That's how much I hated the fucking show  Let's look at their stump fucking human slinky that everyone's fucking creaming over  About the show  I love what I do  And when we created this show  We want to touch all five senses  And when I say five senses  I mean smell and taste too  Ah, that's the farts  Because when we stop  Back to the stupid dinner  Now they show in the horrible dinner again  As part of the smell and taste  the smell and taste and they decide not to rotate the dinner this time around no the same shot from

[03:25:30]  preparation very seriously everything from the corn muffins to the brisket is prepared right here  in our very own kitchen where else would my personal chef and his team make up to 1800 meals  in a single show some people ask how can you eat dinner in the theater no one has because this  there's no entertainment to distract you so while you're watching people jump like fools you can 
[03:26:00]  eat without worrying to applause or laugh okay i just i just i just heard something i heard it too  this could be this could be great this could be great see i thought i i gotta give it away ahead of  time i was very extremely uncomfortable by the tray the tray because everything is squeezed onto the tray  you feel like you feel like you're in a hoarder's house there's no room for anything  now this rewind her and let her let her say what she just said how could you eat dinner without a  table listen to this listen to this single show some people ask how can you eat dinner in the 
[03:26:30]  theater since there's no table oh no you have to put that shitty tray on your lap seriously balance  that fucking thing on your lap it's the tiniest tray ever that's what the fucking oh is you out of  these little fold-out things no i'm sure you just rested on your fucking well she'll probably explain  she's gonna explain but you oh my god people are stealing food left and right you know why  because then they could just come in and sweep the floor down and get another show going they don't 
[03:27:00]  have to clean tables they don't have to uh worry about tables and chairs nothing worse than when you  have to eat your meal on your lap well what what do they do but what do they sit on are they just  chairs we're gonna find out what do you think fists i don't know but this sounds like so  fucking bad 40 bucks no table she's gonna brag about the tiny tray i think yeah that's definitely  it all right let's hear come on i'll show you okay show us oh it's like actually we do have tables no 
[03:27:30]  you don't and they're custom built just for our oh they flip out like an airplane we have a little  secret there are four very strong magnets embedded in each table it prevents sliding and slipping the  only way to really say pause why are they promoting the stupid fucking tray table  with the magnets so you got to sit there in a theater seat like a movie theater seat  that has a fold-out thing like an airplane uh like in the armrest it comes out and then sit there 
[03:28:00]  and eat literally two inches away from the slob next to you  do you know how many fucking people are promoting it this way yeah this is this final selling point  where you're like all the four magnets we got to get tickets immediately four magnets i didn't know  they had the four i thought there were three i was expecting three magnets i'm very impressed  with yakov's theater that gives you four four magnets we got to get tickets for the next we've  been to so many two magnet places and the tray slipped and slid all night do you know how many old 
[03:28:30]  people must be cutting the meat and the tray flips on the floor yes so they finally had to come up with  the magnet system but you're just hitting elbows with some geriatric fucking disgusting slob oh man  fucking getting old's gonna suck yakov you think yakov sits down there in those chairs and eats on his  fucking four magnet tray oh he's having his sinuses fixed oh god but the half the videos this lady 
[03:29:00]  fucking promoting the the magnets i'd love to see the fucking magnets pull an old bag's bridge work  right out of her mouth it just fucking flies out of her face onto the tray they're just addressing  what they know the old people watching this is going to be asking exactly and if people come and  they have too much melanin we tell them no talking during show we got milkman another trucker check it  in uh milkman what what are you hauling today oh take a guess i guess uh milk you don't even know

[03:31:00]  drive me nuts the sewage fucking pipes spilling into the river as you're trying to enjoy nature that's  great what what the missouri dnr has one of the world's largest fish hatcheries down there enough  about the fish hatcheries exactly right there i don't want to see where fish are coming in each  other it's just gross all right sir do you think a shark in history a shark has ever come in the mouth  of another shark for as long as sharks have been around do you think one shark has ever sucked the 
[03:31:30]  cock of another shark i'm sure by accident yeah i'm sure by accident absolutely let's learn about  the magnets place i need to know more about the magnets for the the only way to to really say it  in words is that it's an experience i don't think it's a show i think it's beyond that there's an  emotional value in the show that it's hard to put in words and i think you just have to see it to  to really understand it yakov's dinner adventure it will blow you away 
[03:32:00]  oh man that that looked like a goof that looked like some kind of a goof i don't know if he's  goofing though no i have no idea as a comic you would think you would put that in at the end to be  silly but oh i don't know oh what is this one saying no no no no are we gonna it was a porno booth  what is this the video is called yakov's dinner adventure funny promo oh okay oh this might be  the fun that one was the informative one this is the funny promo that was the serious cell one and 
[03:32:30]  this is now what have fun with the whole thing oh they spell oh this is kind of funny it's russian  around branson chicken outlet but they spelled russian wrong at first and they put russian around  like if you're in a rush you know you're russian around branson but then you change it to r-u-s-s-i-a-n  russian around branson take it out okay that's angering well you know what i agree with him this  is funny so that is comedy so far funny okay house next door to me 
[03:33:00]  he's sitting there in this little hi hi how can i help you my kids i promised them that we're going  to go see a magician guy you know with the tigers and then for my wife i said we're going to go see  the 12 irish tanners because you can clearly see i'm irish oh the candlassic so we were wondering 
[03:33:30]  if we're going to be able to squeeze them both in today of course you can here in russian around  branson we aim to please we have 12 irish tanners at 2 p.m you got kirby at 8 p.m  kirby no problem with the wannabe ziegfried and roy guy do you have plans for dinner  yakov's dinner what do you suggest pause well do you have your heart set on a table  because if you don't we have magnets for you you'll fly coach because if you fly coach you're going to 
[03:34:00]  love the dinner arrangements i wonder if that's that ask the old people if they have metal rods  in their arms yeah some kind of shit that like gets stuck on the magnet no dinner for you if you  got the metal rods wow my canned laughter that was horrible oh it's gotta be it's funny i don't get it  he's supposedly a comic i guess he is a comic no why why would he sit there and think this is funny  because he was never funny he he was he's been a hack forever huge yeah he was huge but he was never 
[03:34:30]  funny before people would say he was funny because it was like he's a russian guy he goofed on russians  and we hated russians so anybody that looked like a dumb russian we were like that was funny to us  i think uh for the time when he first came out he was funny doing that bit i think the problem that  people have with yakov is he never fucking let it go he bashed the soviet union when we hated the  soviet union so he was like you know it was like having a guy do a wacky japanese right thing for the 
[03:35:00]  time when it was all about russia this guy comes along he's got a little set about russia i think  for the time is probably considered very funny probably was but now 40 how many years you think  30 years later easily he will not let it fucking go he's built quite the empire well i'm irish  yeah they get it candleston not let's uh click on that and see what what he's going to suggest for  dinner i wonder oh boy a shotgun shell you put the end in your mouth and you take your toll and you flick it 
[03:35:30]  don't mention the four magnets don't mention the four magnets don't mention the four magnets  scrumptious scrumptious strawberry shortcake what do you think he'll say delicious yeah he's  gonna say scrumptious he loves saying scrumptious i'm gonna go with scrumptious  is he gonna go with refreshing fun fun fun fun fun good magnets tray anything i don't know if he's  gonna hit up the magnets here you don't want to you don't want to bludgeon the guy with too much fun  and enjoyment if you're gonna have dinner why not have an adventure yakov's dinner adventure 
[03:36:00]  it starts at 4 30. why does he have a fucking wing he winked it made the it made the little bell when  he winked and then he uh a canned laughter came in even the canned laughter kind of left that one  bond yeah because he's yakov they can't even get the the right canned laughter that was canned in  difference that was camden laughter can you rewind that a little bit yeah i gotta i definitely got  it well i like the wink with the little sound effect you like that yeah i like it it's nice 
[03:36:30]  it starts at 4 30 and it ends at 6 45 what so you can easily make it hold on two hours and 15 minutes  of horseshit in the afternoon pretty much it's probably an intermission though they can all go  to the bathroom and fucking empty their diapers oh just that horrible fucking pure aged old person  shit how would you know that it really is like fucking creamed corn you wring out their underwear like 
[03:37:00]  a fucking dish right like a fucking socks roll yellow like with yakov's dinner theater bathroom  must smell like when you walk in there oh god smells like disease yeah death all right colostomy cleaning  station yeah bird show any show at 8 pm would be good let's say you want to see hay goods you still  go to irish tanners yakov's dinner adventure and then hay goods or hey good let's say you want to  see mickey gilly mickey gilly or let's say you want to see pierce arrow there at 8 pm no problem okay okay 
[03:37:30]  okay all right what if i want to go see that um japanese guy he's at 7 30. good for you you've done  some research here so here's what's going to happen you still see irish tanners what is he doing you still  go to yakov's dinner adventures you can figure this out on his own and you're going to leave there  fast because you don't have to keep that do you want that awful dub job that was terrible bad leave 
[03:38:00]  there fast you're going to leave there fast like like you got to rush the uh dinner the yakov dinner  adventure you got to like shove it down you throw it and leave the other guy to catch the uh show i bet  people were missing it they're so old so he has to say fast i watched your video and i laughed but  i didn't make the next show i missed the 7 30 show sure i laughed at it was a lot of laughs but i didn't  make the next show i've shat myself how do you keep everything hot why are we doing this for an hour 
[03:38:30]  i don't know but i'm captivated by it let's get that fast dub yeah let me hear it and you're going  to leave there fast because you don't have to pay the bill dinner is free it's not free you don't have  to leave the tip so you get out like that and you can still easily make it to so pause we don't have 
[03:39:00]  the tip because as you know the the jews will come in and they won't tip anyway no i will the blacks so  the whites always feel obligated so the dirty jews and filthy blacks make the tip no happen  and those stupid magnets are just taking the change right out of your pockets exactly  jesus christ this is unbelievable soldier show at 7 30 so you're saying i can see the irish  the russians and the japanese all in one day and have a great dinner 
[03:39:30]  why are you laughing i don't know if you're laughing because he said great dinner  and there are people who may know they know it's like they wouldn't have laughed if he said and you  can eat a shit mediocre dinner on your lap yes like you're in coach you think he's just the king of  branson though yeah where he can't absolutely think he is oh but he's just talking is enraging to listen to  yeah all right uh oh another character another truck driving looking guy hello oh we just pulled in

[03:40:30]  this is so fucking bad i i can't take it i think we're losing listeners i really do yeah this is so  bad yeah it has a personalized license plate it's personalized because my daddy made it personally  he's in prison i guess i'm proud of my family i've been married three time three time 
[03:41:00]  and check his fingers still have the same mother-in-law  ah so he's marrying sisters well we're thinking about these edits are horrendous outdoors you know maybe go  fishing hang yourself then see a few shows and find a good place to eat now we're a pretty big  family with some big appetite so we need to find a place where we can eat a lot of food well how about  the yakov's dinner adventure you know none of those fancy places when you have to dress up all right to

[03:52:30]  the jokes no i never did i couldn't when you do a show like red eye or joy behar or tough crowd  that's when you come up it's funny because they give you the topics and you write about that's when  it's fun right you know but i'm playing golf with guys and you can't tell them your comics they  fucking it's the worst so i usually start telling you jokes oh it's fucking hard although one guy  told me a good told me a good joke last week he goes this guy comes home and says to his wife tell  me something that's going to make me happy and mad and she goes well you got a bigger dick than your 
[03:53:00]  brothers uh that was the joke it wasn't all right but i tell him i'm an fbi profiler and i get more  questions and i just lie my way through the fucking round do you why i'm sad for rich why you're living  the fan you want to see what it's like to be to be like that guy what are you doing well i don't  want to tell him i'm a comic i'm an fbi profiler what am i going to say i'm a house painter that's 
[03:53:30]  boring exactly that's the point you don't want to talk to them you don't tell me you have a  fascinating job because then you're going to be caught up in lies i'm an astronaut right  i was on the last space shuttle mission you always come up but i always say marketing because who the  fuck wants to talk about marketing right why you could say opie and anthony i don't feel like talking  about opie and anthony oh i see what you're saying i fucked you well with it i'm sorry rich  touche fucking touche and i'm out and i'm fucking gonna explain why i'm an idiot good job 
[03:54:00]  i've said advertising before you do right because i don't want to no one believes they're just say  marketing they don't go they don't go oh really could you tell me you know for who they don't give  a fuck yeah but i like any conversation to them all day about the profile but you're an fbi profiler  yeah and what do they say they probably wonder like how could get all vocabulary is so bad  how could he be a profiler jesus well they're not the brainiacs on the book and they're not obviously  you're not so what what kind of questions do they ask you i worked on the uh uh what do you call it 
[03:54:30]  seattle the the green river what was it called  i worked on that i told him i worked wait a minute you say  who the guy is that you worked on he even goes for high profile cases  yeah i told him i worked on the green apple killer i know i told him i worked on the  alana he's alana uh child killers that was 81 oh yeah you're all yeah he's fine you're  fucked up you are fucked up you're fucked up you might have multiple personalities or something 
[03:55:00]  he doesn't even have one that's too twisted you're a liar that's too twisted you're an fbi profiler  and you work on high profile cases that's fucking weird dude i don't do it all the time  sometimes the fact that you've done it once do you get caught up in your lies though because  you don't have enough info on the green river killer i give them enough what do you know on  is it the green river killer jimmy yeah what do you know on that it was in seattle let's make  believe you're talking to us wow you're sbi and then you know when we were profiling uh from the uh 
[03:55:30]  remains well and then i go look i can't talk a lot about it but it was very no books written about  it why can't you it was really intense what like we had to profile for the evidence it was really  intense what an idiot who offers nothing are you losing your mind yes you are right you're  losing a little bit huh i'm an fbi profiler the green river whatever it was 
[03:56:00]  he never disappoints this fucking guy wow whatever no i want i want to hear more about  that what does your job entail well they asked me what i work out of one guy said what do you work  i go to norc i work out of the federal building in norc and i knew it was in norc he goes where i go  on division street i guessed so i obviously i was right it was in that area now we're doing mainly a  lot on uh on you know terrorists and terrorist type threats and stuff like that but you know back 
[03:56:30]  back in the day it was more murders and just you know when we worked on the atlanta case  uh what was the guy's name who was the child killer in atlanta child killer some black dude uh  what was his name though uh well this is a question that someone could ask oh oh oh kyle grooms  and no and they uh the uh the uh the fbi were the ones who who actually uh the police thought  that in atlanta that it was a black uh that it was white supremacist and clan who were doing it how did 
[03:57:00]  you guys know that it was a black killer well this is how we knew it we uh the killer would call we  would talk to the killer and uh the killer said that there was a body on say the killer again the  killer said there was a body on on on martin luther king boulevard or whatever so we went there  and we had obviously lookouts and uh we went to dig up lookouts we had lookouts we had you know uh fbi  we had uh a lot of g-men and uh we were digging up the road we dug up side of the road and we dug 
[03:57:30]  up we dug up the wrong we dug up the wrong side of the road on purpose no stop them for a second you  don't you don't do this what do you mean i'm getting really uncomfortable i don't do you don't  do this i don't get this much you brought this bit to the show today i appreciate it you're actually  an fbi profiler on the road sometime oh my god i didn't say it was a good one but you're terrible  do people just walk away from you well when i bite my arm 
[03:58:00]  you bite your arm when you miss yes wait what happens to me he bites his arm when he misses  this but in front of other people  what the  fuck wait have you ever bitten your arm after you're telling someone you're a profiler

[03:59:00]  they don't want to ask about the profiling anymore yeah i fucking bite i used to  between my uh bicep to my shoulder was my spot uh-huh i go like this and bite really hard when  you're frustrated or yeah i don't do it anymore i don't know why i guess i'm more chill i don't  know what you can't get your arm to your mouth uh remember james con like that  so in the middle of telling them you're an fbi profile you you bite your arm real  depends how bad i don't want to talk to you  the green guy river guy who was you don't even know the atlanta child killer he's one of those famous 
[03:59:30]  serial killers ever what was his name again williams oh wayne yeah so why oh wayne of course  so why why wouldn't you google some of this before you tell all your lies yeah so you're up on your  info you know how did they get him to explode on the stand um what happened  they started they brought up his mom and his childhood they bring up his childhood and uh  how did it but i was right about how they dug up the wrong side of the road you were but you just 
[04:00:00]  the way you said it was the way the lookout says they had look out we have lookouts fbi uh  profile road you keep saying profile profiler other profilers do it all the time the fact that  you've ever even thought about doing it yeah if you do it once it's too many times well you never  lied you say you you say you're in marketing but that's where it ends but not you want to keep  talking yeah because i know they'll never ask a follow-up question what if they do i swear to you 
[04:00:30]  i don't think they ever have because no one that they see unfortunately because when you're you have  to write where you work because you can't fuck up you know paperwork so i write serious x i'm like oh  what do you do for them i'm like oh fuck i'm marketing and i say like that i'm marketing and it ends  the conversation they don't want to hear about marketing they want to hear about uh you know uh  some of these radio shows not a marketing guy and then you don't have to talk to him about that  crap then you could talk to him about whatever you want to talk to him about right well it's 
[04:01:00]  fucking yesterday i played in some like i played a front by myself in the back and i joined the two  ladies and this guy he knew i was a comic hey where you working uh fucking leave me alone then two  holes later hey ladies did he tell you what he does and it's just so fucking anger and there's  jay moore has entered the studio i think she had a i ran down the hallway because i heard mush mouth  was here i was like oh my god it's the first time you exercise this month it's true wow  you attacked me i attacked back how about you shut up before you're rolling in here to kick your ass 
[04:01:30]  again oh remember that you weren't even here i was here no no you heard about i'm always here wow  i missed you rich i missed you i ran down the halls i swear i ran down the hall and they go oh rich boss is  in there and you lost a little muscle mass yourself with your little front porch you got  going what are you talking about that's true right a little bit here it comes here it comes  old man abs with some underpants on i got a fucking pop abs 
[04:02:00]  as far as i saw him without a shirt i want to stop working out  fucking hardly looks like he looked into the ark did you see him  too many words  you missed the hour before you got here jay it's very depressing no ask him what he does  on the road ask him what he does on the road besides play golf i have the elephant man's head  who gives a about his finances i obviously need a doctor i'm john merrick you talk like the 
[04:02:30]  fucking guy you're gonna sleep in a fucking chair here's the difference i don't have to talk we  still have to look at you here's the difference you do have to talk rich it's your whole  fucking library you have to talk and you can't talk people there they don't care you look a guy  hitting zero that just bats fucking lead off every night he's never i'm due i never fail on stage  never tell jay moore what you do on the road besides play golf because it's deeply depressing and we got  it i forgot again what do i do he makes believe ready for this oh that is an fbi profiler when 
[04:03:00]  they say what do you do for a living on the golf course because you don't want to talk about comedy  nobody wants to talk about being an fbi profiler right he's living out this fantasy of just being a  smart guy very smart and then we asked we asked him basic shit and he didn't know he didn't know  the names of the serial killers that he was profiling but here's the thing the public doesn't know  those questions that you know he probably he probably dropped the guy in long island off 
[04:03:30]  he had no idea it was him there's a serial killer yeah yeah i know they just found body 10 okay  did they oh let's hear a little bit about it yeah you're the fbi profiler they went past their uh  perimeter and they're outside the perimeter and they they went first of all it's called his comfort  zone it's not called the perimeter perimeter where the bodies were found you need the lingo  the comfort zone the cover is where he kills or his comfort and they went they went outside his  comfort zone no no they went outside the perimeter of where the bodies were found the other eight 
[04:04:00]  bodies that's the comfort zone comfort zone is where he is killing in his comfort zone that shirt back to  a black act  i would but i don't know his real name it's a rugby shirt jb smooth smooth  ruckus and tell him about the lookouts  the minor league team the chattanooga he's got lookouts so anyhow let's get back to wise guys 
[04:04:30]  no when he's in the fbi you got lookouts you want to call someone from the fbi you got one tell me about  the lookouts well when we were when we were when we were digging up the the fake bodies in atlanta  we had uh lookouts uh to see who was in the crowd and if there's any white people and there was no  white people so we knew that the white there was the the serial killer wasn't white that's all you  know it's hard to explain serial killers are normally white yeah i know but this one was black in atlanta 
[04:05:00]  there's a lot more black ones than you think though they just killed they're white girls  they're just killing their own race what did you say rich nothing  stay tuned still become more of the best of the anthony 2011. prepare for a weekend of country music  that'll take you back there's a tear in my ear not that far back how do you let me know  sirius xm's channel y2 country is taking over the highway it's country's first decade of the new

[04:16:00]  and i i forget that you guys were on a nice roll there but no no no no we've had it's what it is  it's been all over the place all morning it sucks it's been all over the place and you do it's like  i i wasn't able to really watch a lot of the videos that people were posting yesterday because i  don't know it was tough you feel weird uh it was kind of sad i tried a couple times but it was just  like it got too sad but uh then you read some of the shit and you start laughing your ass up because  you just read it in patrice's voice and uh you know that got me laughing pretty good i started 
[04:16:30]  thinking all the stuff that he did he do you know one time you had a meeting at comedy central  and you know you put on your i'm gonna get a deal shirt and go in there and you tap dance and you  try to sell your stupid idea for a show you know he went in there and spent 45 minutes  trashing the executives for putting mind of mencia on the air  he just wouldn't let up and then that was it the meeting ended like that was just basically the 
[04:17:00]  me i think he pitched his show in the final three minutes he he got the opportunity to go in there  and decided he was just going to bash the show oh man that's great yeah and at the end you know  he pitched his show for like three minutes and i remember asking why he did it i go why would you  do that he just started laughing i was thinking about all that stuff you know one time i went up we  probably do you remember the time that that comedian came to town he had the uh he had the metal hand 
[04:17:30]  what what the what is that i'm going to the airport this is my ride hold on a second oh hello  okay all right thanks um freaking guy went to south instead of north yeah so this guy comes to  town he was missing his left hand so he had like one of those three pronged left hand things like  everybody sees it nobody wants to say anything and the great thing was with his left hand but when 
[04:18:00]  when you met the guy you just stuck out your right hand and there was no problem but everybody's  thinking what happened to his what happened to his hand right so after he meets like 10 comics  he then meets patrice and patrice he's the guy and when he goes to shake his hand instead of sticking  out his right hand he sticks out his left hand and the guy with the with the fake hand like just out of  instinct stuck out his left hand and it sort of froze for a second and then patrice with his big  dainty fingers just grabbed one of the metal tongs and it was all this awkwardness and then patrice just 
[04:18:30]  goes what happened to your hand man and like that was that's why i loved the name of his last special  elephant in the room because that's what he always did yeah just addressed you know you want to sit there  and be like that's rude that's insensitive and then you're like dude that's exactly what i was  thinking what happened to your hand yeah i was actually psyched that he asked it and uh i don't 
[04:19:00]  know man i'm gonna miss that guy like uh i don't know yeah it it's crazy because it's you know i mean  i've known quite a few people that have uh that have left us but uh this one is just like it just  because he's so he's so irreplaceable you know yeah i know he's uh yeah he's even beyond the  description of one of a kind yeah yeah kind is almost like hacky at this that's too cliche right 
[04:19:30]  yeah you're right that's what i tweeted yesterday you red-headed cocksucker you  go oh  fuck yourself  he's making a good point  bobby do you know something ever since we started doing these stupid movies and this  goddamn book do you know i now hate the sound of your voice that way that wasn't me you  fucking cocksucker that was the fucking stupid  was that that cocky feature act no that was you don't recognize that raspy shitty voice

[04:27:00]  we don't get greedy and try to pile on and bomb yeah that's right that's what you always get i  was like when boss is here because he'll always end the fucking oh yeah  first of all there's no second of all we're trying to tell him last night how dumb he is 
[04:27:30]  and the different he goes you're dumber than me the other time i'm like i'm not done with you  because i know i'm dumb i admit that i can't spell i know i'm stupid you think you're smart he said on  his podcast put the the the head speakers on he's talking about headphones the head speakers  he called them head speakers bonnie put the head speakers on  bonnie just went head speakers really yeah because he tried to blaze past it and bonnie  goes head speakers are we gonna are we gonna go back to that for a minute are we going to talk 
[04:28:00]  about head speakers he is the dumbest  i i am fully aware that i am stupid yeah in many areas but i know i know certain things  bobby's doing right now this is like when somebody blows the game and before the press  trashes them they go you know i take full response  very good yep that's exactly what he's doing  well when you're right you're right bill why don't you shut your face i hope your phone dies  bill anything else on uh patrice any stories i mean you guys started together a long time ago man 
[04:28:30]  ah god i don't um i don't know no because then i'm i don't know i don't even want to think about it  it's just too fucking sad isn't it um i can't but i just you know i don't know that i'll be able to  wrap my head around him not being all i can say is i'm psyched he got to do your show because  your fans got to get get a glimpse of what it was like to hang out with him because you know 
[04:29:00]  you go on there obviously he wasn't doing his act it's just really being like how that guy on stage  and off was just he's just the funniest fucking guy i ever met yeah there's literally uh like days  and days of material that could be played from the show of him just just hanging out and bullshitting  about everything uh people are that that bit you guys did sorry to interrupt uh that that bit you 
[04:29:30]  guys did the up and down game with patrice lap oh yeah that's like that you know we you know from  his soul i thought he was gonna pass i'm like i used to watch that thing like five times in a row by  myself but i would be crying laughing yeah you can't not laugh watching that yeah the thing  gets up and he's he's walking out of the studio still laughing the door closes and you can still  hear him i threw a soundproof door i remember i couldn't wait to show patrice what we learned 
[04:30:00]  that bobo could do because at that point we saw bobo do that a bunch of times but we knew patrice  would bring it to a whole new fucking level fucking we were so excited like patrice wait  till you see what we got for you today i never expected that reaction i knew he would enjoy it but i  never expected just that over that that that complete breakdown of control oh yeah laughing  yeah he was double he was doubled over doing an old man shuffle out the door because he could not  even hold himself up he was laughing so hard yeah so my favorite part is jim never breaks character and

[04:39:30]  when we started doing the show and before we did tough crowd we did it on nbc a couple of times  and i remember i was always like oh don't leave him alone you know he was like so new to the business  like the only thing he'd ever had and i knew i don't leave him alone with any of these  nbc executives oh yeah and then i remember one time just walking in it and it was like a soundproof  office like every time i left him alone with lauren anybody something horrible would happen  but just a sample person it was like some guy from the west coast was in town and it was just him and 
[04:40:00]  the guy on the west coast and he was sitting there and i looked over at the guy and he had this  horrified look on his face and patrice was talking as if yeah a couple of guys having a conversation  and i just walked in and i heard like pussy and bitches like he was just like spouting to this  like white guy in his 50s in a fucking suit but it's just like it's like as if he's having a  conversation with you know will at the cellar and it's just like i was just the guy just had this  horrified like his face was pacey white he gave no respect no no that's what he would do though 
[04:40:30]  yeah that's a pretty accurate description he gave him no respect yeah i didn't deserve another big  producer once i remember at the cellar this guy was doing like a move and it was like hey patrice  like and i thought i was still had i still said there had to be a slight centella of non-destructiveness  this guy's doing it and the guy goes hi i heard a lot about you matrice is at the  bar at the cellar and he turns around like royalty like this  and then just turns away oh a little dainty handshake 
[04:41:00]  jesus christ he he drove me out to one of ants barbecues one time he's like i'll pick you up and  i was so touched that he was giving me a ride that i spent two hours making him these rap cds  i made him like wow did you talk in between songs too 
[04:41:30]  personal story before every song wow i made him three rap cds i was like these are songs he  he probably doesn't have he'll appreciate jerry i imagine the band striking up the music  oh what a show oh jeez  trying to do this now  what were some of the songs on there it was all rap songs give me a couple  they were all like i need like you're gonna know j yeah i need 
[04:42:00]  cool j doing it yeah doing it well uh hey love uh yeah you can do it  it's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday no no no no i mean i'm like i was like dude  i appreciate you give me a ride man i know you're not going to take gas money i made you these  i thought you might enjoy these for when you're driving gas money  he he goes oh all right like that right because you came out of the closet dude  that's a long ride oh god damn he put every c i swear to god every cd to put it in back to 
[04:42:30]  the back and he just sat there two seconds of each song you go  literally through each cd and he goes i mean joe god damn i mean  you didn't appreciate i appreciate the gesture and all i guess but  you're a white rap historian wow yeah i think there were this is twin hype patrice in the 90s  he called me cracker a few times in between songs and uh but the the funny is that when 
[04:43:00]  he found out i was egyptian he'd call me up like on thanksgiving he'd be like joe you want to come  over for thanksgiving i can't i'm doing stuff with my family he goes you know what joe i'm tired of  you pretending you're white and he'd go everybody knows you're a dirty african just like the rest of us  i remember when i i sent uh patrice a text that i was having a kid he just he calls up i see him 
[04:43:30]  calm i think he's going to graduate he's like but the first thing he says please tell me the  is white  i'll never forget i was at the comic strip uh christmas party and i brought this girl and she  was really hot and patrice just looking her up and down he goes you got this in the bag i go yeah  yeah he goes so i could say whatever i want to go yeah you're sure i don't want to ruin it for you  why would you say yeah i was like no it's fine so i just went over he goes you like this guy and 
[04:44:00]  she's like yeah he's really funny he's like do you know his opening joke is the difference between  alcohol and marijuana you realize that she's like yeah he's really funny yeah i know that one that's  good you realize he does voices of puppets on tv that's like my favorite show and she he goes you're  just a dumb bitch and the girl's like how can you say he's your friend i'm like he's joking she's  like how is that a joke he just told me he ended a couple of my relationships early yeah he did you 
[04:44:30]  know you'd see him get that look in his eye like and you didn't know what what mood patrice is going  to be and he could be the most lovely like little angel or just he would just slowly turn it was  like slow-mo and i saw him sizing up the dude i was with and i'm like i'm like run i'm like no  running over it was too late too late just trash this guy's life the guy i don't think he ever got an 
[04:45:00]  erection again i went to a dinner party one time uh we went we used to have the same manager and they  invited us this dinner party i showed up with a date second date with the girl and i was trying so  hard to impress her i walk in with her patrice goes hey what's up joe who's this and i goes melissa and  he goes hey melissa did you fuck him yet oh did you fuck joe yet and she goes no and he goes you  should fuck him he's a good dude i'm like all right let's have uh hors d'oeuvres now 
[04:45:30]  obviously amy schumer is here and now uh louis ck has entered the studio hey louis  morning guys hello how are you man it's like everybody that twittered yesterday yeah i didn't  you didn't tweet i always feels feels phony really well the thing my heart goes out well  yeah it depends on it well if you word it like colin then it comes off you know it's sensitive and  hacked no it's not colin's coat and say it no it's not that it's phony at all it's just it's to me you 
[04:46:00]  it's just not your thing yeah i don't know yeah yeah i never tweet about anything and so  and all of a sudden you're gonna tweet about something like yeah yeah i don't know i don't  know why i don't do it because i don't love anybody that much i don't care wait till you see colin's  coat i made a witty remark oh boy he's defending it at the beginning of my witticism i happened to  throw in patrice's one of a kind so you know yeah one of a kind right so then they broke the mold  and he comes to the airport and goes yeah i don't leave any tweet like some one of a kind 
[04:46:30]  some hack fucking quote i thought at first he saw my quote was busting my balls but he's just saying  it was even worse he really meant it not knowing what you wrote how about the fact that he didn't  know what you even wrote no yeah no idea that's uh and he didn't bother to investigate the full thing  that i wrote that's what hurt the most true he just picked out the one hack one you know showing  your age part i told my kids this morning about patrice and uh you know and i listened to because 
[04:47:00]  i told i told them i'm going here afterwards and then all his friends are going to be here and  and so i turned it on and there's fucking but is he here still bobby did he leave  yeah i turned on his and bobby's he's not even saying anything he's just and the  fucking we're all at the cellar last night and we're he's just telling a story  he could be saying anything he's like what the fucking salad and fucking what's his name is there 
[04:47:30]  and fucking he's not upset he's not it's just this  shit that comes out of his fucking mouth i think he's just going to pop and my daughters are six  and nine i'm going i'm trying to ride the volume and they can't enjoy people's emotions about their  fucking past friend because of this and so they go like why does he they had to ask like why does  this person because it sounds crazy yeah of course if you don't listen to it all the time it's like 
[04:48:00]  what's wrong with this it's beyond tourette's it's like that's so odd because here well when he was  here talking into the mic didn't you don't realize it because he says a lot but i guess if you're  listening to it to it on the radio it's you really especially with children right right but i explained  to them that patrice and bobby and i came from boston and that there was i told them what it's like  to do comedy there that there's drunk irish people i'm getting them i'm getting them i'm teaching  them stereotypes the irish bostonians get wasted and they just and they sing na na na hey hey you 
[04:48:30]  get chanted off stage and so people had different ways to survive that and uh bobby's was i explained  to the kids the difference between like you're trying to tell a story so i went to the store and  the guy there was really uh mean to me nobody's listening they're throwing stuff at you i went to  a fucking store and the fucking guy was a fucking asshole like it's a way of charging through the 
[04:49:00]  ship like that's what turns guys like that and then patrice was just this enormous a mountain that  sat on stage he was just a mountain uh a whole other approach to being listened to by those audiences  yeah bostonians terrified of giant black men yeah just a huge uh presence uh yeah did you start out  with him on the stage no he came uh up after i'd left boston and then he just showed up here as this  boston yeah young enormous boston guy bigger than life he's just yeah he didn't have to move around 
[04:49:30]  on stage or anything so last time i just saw him on stage we did uh the nasty show in chicago  at the vic theater and it was me and him and nick de paulo were you on that show i don't remember if  you what year was it uh i did that with gerald and patrice a year and a half ago i don't know if i was on  that one but he closed the show i hosted it and he went on last and he was i mean it's just he  would just stand there and yeah he was he was really starting to hit a stride too he was getting 
[04:50:00]  great i mean he's always been one of my favorite comedians like always in like the top three since  i first saw him but in the last few years he just started to get great like he figured every comedian  hits some point where they figure out their thing like they do the hellraiser box they click  get right and everybody starts coming out of the doors and everybody and he just didn't hit that  i mean just that last special was incredible he was just starting to figure out how to make his thing 
[04:50:30]  really work yeah and and off stage to be able to do that on stage is fantastic but then off stage just  to hang out and bullshit about stuff and make it genuinely funny any subject that would come up in  here when he was sitting here he had he had something at least i was telling i was trying  to explain him to my kids because i i want them to understand what this stuff is besides that he was  big black guy and he said crazy um i had to like i'm explaining him i had to say that he was black at 
[04:51:00]  some point like it didn't matter but at some point i had to say he's a huge black guy like it i didn't  it didn't actually wasn't material to anything i had to say right but you do you feel compelled to  describe like that yeah and also the life lesson that you gotta fucking take care of yourself but  yes true you know which is it makes me angry at him but uh it's just that's the you know biggest  substance abuse problem amongst black people is cherry coke but 
[04:51:30]  still the biggest killer but i told him i thought of a bit that he did here that i was able to explain  to them and for a six and a nine-year-old to grasp it was kind of weird but they got it because of his  wording which was um about plaxico or whatever the guy's name was to shot himself yeah yeah the thing  that he said about how his you know he was rich now living in a mansion and he had a choice in life  he could live hang out with rich white guys and play golf or hang out with black guys that he grew up 
[04:52:00]  with but if he won't who are fun but in order to do that he had to carry a gun because those guys are  fucking stupid like live amongst your own but he's not stupid he's rich now so he had to carry  a weapon in order to hang out with his own people that's such an acute observation that's where he  would find these like cracks in the the little things yeah no one else was thinking about my kids  were howling they they got why that was funny wow there was there would be shit that like i pondered 
[04:52:30]  for years and when the subject came up i felt all good about being able to discuss it and talk about  it and then i was saying before in one sentence he'd wrap it up and and be like how did i never  see that and he'd close the book on it yeah yeah done here's here's what it is yeah that then that's  it and that's where everyone now has to refer to patrice versus the people  the people for racial harmony 
[04:53:00]  no and he i mean i remember he like the the famous thing of him going on whatever it was on fox news  yeah we just played that yeah this is a woman who actually dresses up to go and protest a rape joke  and he makes her laugh at a rape she laughed at it she absolutely that's the power of what he did  yeah yeah couldn't she even she couldn't deny this woman whose whole i whole life is i'm gonna go  act outraged right yeah and she had to go shit that's funny that's funny i wonder what she's doing 
[04:53:30]  now that could have been good when she went back to the office change your path yeah yeah  he was a guy who forced people he also didn't take any easy roads himself like everybody does some  bullshit version of themselves everybody does i do i have like a bunch of jokes that i know are  just there because i old fat oh you know right overweight middle-aged dad like i got a bunch of  those and i'm gonna ace in the hole yeah exactly he has i was gonna say he forced you to be honest 
[04:54:00]  man yeah and he he didn't do that himself like he was such an atypical the first thing he ever did  that made that i saw that made me go this guy is special was uh his bit about how he loves the  beatles and the pressure as a black guy to have certain trappings and he says i love the beatles  but i can't and he do it you know this visual of him riding around in a cadillac we all live in  yellow submarine look in the hood what's up jeep yellow submarine yellow submarine but uh that's not 
[04:54:30]  your typical uh big black guy bit no no we we got into so many great uh racial uh conversations on this  show oh yeah and uh you know he he he just slammed me and uh but the great thing was the second the  show ended you know we'd be walking down the the sidewalk going to the parking garage and he's just  you know hey how's your pool what's that like your pool and that cool no my favorite part of being on 
[04:55:00]  this show i loved being on when he was on because he'd get like we could we would lock horns on the  stuff and get like i i told him once i wasn't attracted sexually to black women yeah and he  tested me for like two hours saying the same that that meant i'm gay  and he said so he would go like and he was he started doing this bit where he'd be like please  bring up like and it was like a lawyer asking for he was like uh uh please bring up fatbooty.com 
[04:55:30]  yeah yeah yeah go to the website he's like really nothing there's nothing that you can  you know what bring up yeah look at that that's juicy pissing on blacktits.net anything could come  up and he'd go this you don't like this references man but we would go at it here and then yeah we'd  walked the best part that was walking down to the subway with him and then we'd stand on like sixth  avenue and and seventh or 57th and just stand there for like four hours yeah yeah and he'd say openly 
[04:56:00]  sexual things to every woman that walked by and they would all smile you look delicious yeah he's  just like look at you with those pants what kind of panties you got on pink bye good morning he was  on a street corner yeah when we would do the when we would do the walk over at the old station right  and we'd be walking to xm uh and patrice would just stop and talk to any girl yeah that was walking  and they would engage him yes they would talk to him and it's like why aren't they running 
[04:56:30]  he would disarm you because he was funny and silly and he wasn't threatening and right  look at him but i think he would be threatening right right i mean just his physical presence  would be threatening and the ability maybe that's what it was it was the relief it's like oh no  right he's not he's got kind of a sweet voice oh i want to hug him we were at the comic strip one  time and there was a girl he liked at a christmas party and he's like trying to play hard to get  he's i'm not going to talk to her and he didn't talk to her and she didn't come over and i said you 
[04:57:00]  fucking idiot you think that you're being like hard to get she's happy you're not talking to her  she doesn't like you he really thought that she was being intrigued by his evasiveness  fucking fat creep was leaving her alone the ability to uh diffuse his his physical presence  with something so fast like that quickly when he started talking to you is amazing yeah like  because you you would just look and go ah big black man must be afraid must cross street 
[04:57:30]  he was an empathetic person too i mean that's what made him a great comic is that he saw you  know he had insight because he was empathetic but he was a guy who would like talk to him for five  minutes he started asking you about your life and oh absolutely yeah yeah every single time hey you  like your truck yeah be talking about my truck and stuff yeah i got minus i like it yeah oh yeah really  where is this conversation going you knew it wasn't a conversation he was basically fishing  for information and when he was done he was just gonna walk away or get off the phone it wasn't 
[04:58:00]  like i really want to know about your truck i need a piece of this and a piece of that and then you're  done with it that's right that's right i'm gonna put on my bowler hat yeah yeah mr cotton club  a lot of looks oh remember he pulled off the pink panther pink shirt how we didn't rip him  we tried too man yeah he was wearing a pink white pink shirt with the pink panther on there what  the only he could get away with that holy walking in here with that shit on it had the pink panther on 
[04:58:30]  it yeah oh yeah it had uh what sequins on with the glitter and oh what the fuck he was trying to  pull off with that one we tried we didn't get the best of them that day uh dude one of the funniest  days in here ever was we he was in here and we started talking about food from around the country  and he started trashing every city's food and he's going he's going chicago deep dish pizza stinks it
