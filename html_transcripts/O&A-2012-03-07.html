<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry Kingâ€™s suggestive introduction, seguing into a discussion of the Republican primaries, focusing on Mitt Romney's lead and the perceived selfishness of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum remaining in the race.  The hosts made vulgar comments about the attractiveness of various presidents' daughters, specifically the Bush twins and Amy Carter.  This transitioned into a discussion of the Rush Limbaugh controversy and the power of advertisers to influence radio programming.  Opie and Anthony voiced their opposition to advertiser boycotts and speculated on the motives behind advertisers pulling their ads from Limbaugh's show, touching upon Obama's response and infrequent press conferences. The segment concluded with further discussion on advertiser pressure and a humorous anecdote about Opie's experience taking his child to see *The Lorax*.

The next segment featured a caller recounting his frustrating movie-going experience with his toddler, along with anxieties around punctuality. This led to a discussion about inconsiderate parents in public spaces, including a graphic description of a fellow passenger's poor hygiene on a flight.  The second major topic was the suspected faking of sick days by their coworker, E-Rock, with detailed descriptions of his unconvincing attempts to appear ill.  Troy joined the conversation via phone, contributing to the ribbing of E-Rock.  The segment included a sexually explicit bit by "Club Soda Kenny," discussions on whether a two-year-old should wear 3D glasses,  further mention of the Rush Limbaugh advertiser fallout, and humorous observations about religion, science, and the relative fragility of humans.

The following segment started with a discussion about the hypothetical fighting capabilities of oversized insects, prompted by a caller, JD, suggesting giant mosquitoes.  This transitioned to Opie recounting a perceived slight from Adam Corolla. The insect discussion resumed, focusing on flies, mosquitoes, gnats, ticks, culminating in a hypothetical scenario involving a giant tick.  The hosts then discussed a racially insensitive commercial for Western Sky, a loan company, calculating its exorbitant interest rates.  A caller, Joe, shared his negative experience with the company.  Opie shared a traumatic experience with a flea infestation, followed by other callers sharing their flea horror stories.  The segment also included discussion of cat videos, cat behavior, a caller's anecdote about his ex-girlfriend's cat, Peyton Manning's release from the Colts, and a brief segment featuring Andrew Dice Clay's parenting advice.  A previous caller, Evan, was also mentioned.


The next segment focused on Peyton Manning's free agency and a hypothetical encounter between Sam Roberts and Dr. Ruth Westheimer, filled with highly graphic and sexually explicit descriptions and jokes.  The hosts attempted a phone call to a presumably absent co-worker, Eric, and discussed the upcoming Apple iPad release, including a bet between Opie and Travis.  Other news items briefly discussed included Kirk Cameron's comments on gay marriage, a Hulk Hogan sex tape, and Davy Jones' funeral. Ron from Indy called in to discuss Peyton Manning, and Sam Roberts participated remotely to discuss his interview with Dr. Ruth and the Hulk Hogan sex tape.


The show continued with a discussion of the hosts' preference for nudity in movies and their observations of women's attire in gyms, focusing on sports bras and yoga pants.  Sam Roberts participated in browsing websites featuring women in revealing clothing and rating pictures of breasts on "Boobcritics.com".  Callers Matt and Ben shared similar perspectives on the allure of accidental glimpses of female anatomy.  Guest Nicole joined the show to address relationship rumors, which led to further sexually explicit conversation.  The segment included crude jokes about various ethnic groups and body parts, a discussion of a potentially photoshopped image of a man inappropriately touching women in a yoga class, and further discussion of websites with nude photos and videos. A caller expressed displeasure with the hosts' behavior.

The final segment focused on a persistent caller, Kenny, and the hosts' and Troy's (in studio) differing approaches to handling his calls.  Troy criticized Sam for being too accommodating, using offensive language. Sam eventually hung up on Kenny.  The conversation shifted to Eric's absence, speculating on his whereabouts, and the ongoing bet between Opie and Travis about the iPad size. The segment concluded with the show's ending announcement, promotion of their Facebook page, and upcoming show times.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You should get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hogging. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I remember that one.  I like that one.  It's the Larry King.  But away.  But away.  Come on.  I'm waiting for you.  I got that one this morning when I came in. 
[00:01:00]  Actually, I got like three in a row.  Good morning, good morning, good morning.  He's excited, huh?  Wow, he loves the hump day.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Isn't it a fine morning?  It is because we could say we have officially turned the corner, as they say.  Turned the corner.  Goodbye winter.  Oh, what is it, spring or something?  No, not really.  You just know.  You just know when we officially turn the corner.  Today is turn the corner day. 
[00:01:30]  60 degrees today?  Something like that.  Could be upwards of close to 70 tomorrow?  Yeah, something like that.  In our area.  In our area.  Pretty much for most of the country.  Yeah.  We'll be feeling the warmth.  Yeah, it's the warmth.  So, what, Romney got that Ohio?  Because when I went to bed, it was too close to call.  That's very close.  38% for Romney, 37% for Centorum.  Super Tuesday.  Centorum.  That's like on the periodic table of elements. 
[00:02:00]  Centorum.  Centorum.  What's Centorum's atomic number?  It just does sound like one of those things.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So, Romney looks like he took that.  Looks like he got a shitload of the delegates.  And I think at this point, really, it's time to just let Romney, let him run, let him go as the candidate, and let him start beating up on Obama.  And see what happens.  Yeah.  These guys aren't going to drop out, though.  I know. 
[00:02:30]  It's selfish.  They kind of feel like he's wounded.  They feel like he's a wounded candidate, and they could be the main guy.  Nude, I don't know why he's still in it.  But I love the nude.  I just love that he's just an asshole.  Yeah, nude just is going to stay in it.  I think it's odd, though, that you would just, I guess you get so close to it.  Like, all of them had their real big peaks.  Gingrich was a frontrunner for a while.  Centorum, you know, recently.  Don't forget Herman Cain.  Yeah, Herman Cain had his bump and everything.  And when you're in that moment, I guess you feel like, holy shit, there's a chance I could be president of the United States. 
[00:03:00]  And then when it drops off, I don't think you want to realize, like, oh, well, I got to duck out.  You're like, no, I'm not going to get this close again.  It's got to be at least four years.  Are you talking about our radio careers or?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Or the GOP.  The GOP.  Or the GOP.  Exactly.  Because that kind of sounded like what we have been talking about.  Yeah.  We were there once.  We were there.  And I know we could be there again. 
[00:03:30]  I remember.  I just know we could do this.  Maybe it's time for us to drop out.  To drop out of the race.  Right.  Yeah, I hear you.  But you would think there's more powerful people behind the scenes going, look, Newt, Santorum, you're fucking up the party.  We've got to let this guy run.  This is our best choice right now, and we've got to do this thing.  And they don't realize, another thing I don't think people realize, you've got Romney, who's, he's a moderate. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, he's a stiff.  He's a moderate Republican.  He's not a conservative.  Gingrich and Santorum have been plugging away, saying he's not a conservative, not a conservative.  Now, the conservative, the right-wing conservative, they're not going to vote for Obama.  So it doesn't matter.  But he wants to keep those people on board, so he's not acting as moderately as he usually would.  So he's lying to everybody.  Well, yeah, for politics.  But then again, they all do.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  That's not a...  But until Gingrich and Santorum leave the race, he can't really come out and try to vie for Obama's moderate constituency.  Right, I got you.  Because he's opening up himself to Gingrich and Santorum to say, look, this guy's not a conservative.  Right.  And alienate part of the conservatives.  So the whole process is bullshit.  It is.  They should back out and let him really start drifting a little over to center and try to grab some of those independents and moderates that, you know, don't like the hard right. 
[00:05:00]  Because the hard right's going to vote for anybody about Obama anyway.  So he's got to start gathering up those mid-range people and the independents and the people that are a little more in the middle.  And he can't do that while Santorum and Gingrich are pounding on him still.  He's not even close to a conservative.  No, he's not.  More importantly, Santorum's kid was bored as hell last night.  Oh, just yawning.  You're going to see this clip a lot today. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think his kid's, what, 12 years old?  Yeah.  Any kid would be doing that.  Oh, thank you.  Boring.  I hope they don't make too much out of it because I'm not a fan of Santorum at all.  Right.  But, you know, you expect a 12-year-old to hang in there?  He's bored.  He's got to be bored out of his mind.  He don't give a fuck his father's trying to become the president.  You know how horrid that would be to have to stand on that stage while, as a 12-year-old, all you're hearing is,  blah-dee, blah-dee, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. 
[00:06:00]  It's like, well, I don't care.  He was probably promised a hamburger and french fries and, like, a milkshake if he could just stand there properly for a while.  Remember that feeling you got when you had to go to the mall with your mom when you were a kid?  Oh, yeah.  And you just kind of, ah!  You lose, like, muscular control.  Your body parts got heavy.  You're like, ah!  Oh, God.  And then you see the light at the end of the tunnel, that doorway, the big mall wall of doors to the parking lot.  And then you're almost out. 
[00:06:30]  You're almost out.  And she goes, oh, look at this.  Ah!  No!  No, it's another half hour of trying stuff on.  And you're saying that's no different when your father's trying to become president.  And blah-dee, blah-blah-blah.  And I will blah-dee-blah.  Oh, shut up.  Oh!  They counted.  He yawned 13 times when Santorum talked last night.  But more importantly than that, it gave the media this morning, and you'll see this a lot today, 
[00:07:00]  the excuse to play the Rudy Giuliani clip with his son.  Which no one will ever fucking beat.  No, no.  Rudy Giuliani's son, when Giuliani was giving his speech.  1993, by the way.  1993.  Almost 20 years ago.  And his son was, like, acting out what his dad was doing.  And he was right next to the podium.  He was right there.  And, of course, SNL, Chris Farley, did a goof on that. 
[00:07:30]  That was one of, I think, one of SNL's funniest moments.  Wasn't the kid, like, pointing?  Yeah, he's pointing.  He's, like, pointing at people like, yeah, you!  And he's leaning into his father as his father's trying to give this big speech.  And he was mimicking his dad, too, at one point.  It was hilarious.  Turns out that kid hates his father, by the way.  Yeah, now he's, yeah.  Last I heard, unless they patched things up in the last few years.  I think when you get those ugly divorces, like he had with, uh...  He went with Mommy.  Yeah, he went with Mommy.  He went with Mommy.  What was the other wife's name?  Donna.  Donna Hanover.  Donna Hanover. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Was that newswoman.  And I can't get over Santorum's daughter, man.  She is freaking...  What?  I wouldn't call her ugly, I guess, but she is...  Oh, I thought you were going to say hot.  No!  She looks like him with a wig on.  Yeah, she really does.  She kind of looks like a tranny.  Not...  A young tranny, to be honest with you.  You know, the bar has been set with the young Bush daughters.  Oh, God.  And they were pretty.  They were fucking wild.  Mm-hmm.  You know, out drinking with fake IDs and shit while your dad's the president. 
[00:08:30]  That was fucking hot.  Hottest president's daughters?  Hottest president's daughters.  The Bush daughters.  Is that how you would say that?  Hottest president's daughters?  What if there's one daughter, though?  I'm just thinking daughters in general.  Hottest president's daughter.  Let's go with that.  Yeah, who was it?  Because now you've got to pick one of the Bush girls.  I liked the wild one that was a little chubbier.  Was it the dark hair?  Growing up.  Or the blonde hair?  The blonde hair.  Blonde hair?  I would have went dark hair with the Bush daughter, I think.  I've got to see a picture of them again.  Let's see.  It's been a few years.  Yeah, bring up the Bush daughters. 
[00:09:00]  And just having that name.  Bush.  Did Taft have a hot daughter?  She had a big mustache, though.  Oh, she did?  The dark-haired one looked more like her mom.  And the blonde one looks a little too much like dad.  Wait, I might go with the skinnier one.  I like the brunettes, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, the other one looks a little too much like you're banging George W.  The blonde looks like she parties a little more than the brunettes.  Why don't you go down on my pussy?  Go down on that pussy. 
[00:09:30]  JFK's daughter.  Whoa, her eyes are a little googly-eyed.  Whoa.  But that's her mom was a little googly-eyed, too.  Ah, true.  Yeah, she had that little googly-eyed thing going on.  But still probably the hottest president's daughter.  You'll fuck that eye straight.  I'll fuck that eye straight.  Oh, no, you gotta go brunette all the way in.  Yeah, yeah.  All the way.  But the blonde one, I think, was a little wilder.  You know, there's some equity in that.  Now, someone's saying the hottest president's daughter ever.  Nixon?  Nixon's daughter.  Trisha? 
[00:10:00]  Corey's array in North Carolina.  Trisha Nixon?  Are you out of your bird?  Let's take a look.  JFK is out of the running.  Carolyn Kennedy.  No.  She was not.  Not a looker.  Nah, I don't think so.  No.  Don't try to drag the Kennedy name into this one.  Let's see.  The Nixon's.  Well, Chelsea.  That's Chelsea.  I mean, Chelsea.  No.  Nixon's daughter was not pretty.  Well, let's take a look here.  What does this have to do about the GOP nomination?  I don't know.  We kind of go everywhere, don't we? 
[00:10:30]  It's fine, though.  Nah.  No one's even listening to this fucking show.  Sure.  It works here at SiriusXM anyway, so who cares?  It's unbelievable.  Chelsea Clinton, no.  She had a good comeback, though.  She did, but she went over the top.  Ah!  Stop.  What was that?  Stop.  Who is that?  That's Trisha Nixon.  She wasn't bad.  She wasn't bad, but, you know.  When we were living in the black and white times.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a black and white picture of her.  We're supposed to, you know, look at that. 
[00:11:00]  Nah, come on.  What other daughters?  The Bush daughters blow that away.  Now, obviously, Carter, you could just throw away.  You don't even have to go there.  You don't even have to go there.  And she never went through a phase where she was pretty.  Remember we did a bit ugliest?  Ugliest.  The president's daughter.  And it was between Carter's daughter and, of course, Clinton's daughter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to go, oh, Patty Davis Reagan. 
[00:11:30]  Come on.  She was the wildest.  She was wild with a playboy.  With a black man.  With a black guy grabbing a tits.  With a black man grabbing her hand bra.  From behind.  Yeah.  For the cover.  Yes.  She was definitely the wildest.  I didn't like that one.  Nah.  No.  Yes.  Then there's, who else is there?  Alice Roosevelt?  Alice Roosevelt.  Alice?  Oh, Alice Roosevelt Longworth.  I am now introducing Alice Roosevelt Longworth.  Wait, is this a website called Hottest President's Daughters?  It just ranks the top six. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, is she fucking, she looks like, let's take a look now.  You got to like, you got to go, you got to put an old, old filter on your eyes.  All right.  Let me try an old filter.  So you get rid of all that stuff that made even a 20-year-old look old back then.  She's wearing drapes.  I can't tell.  I know.  She's like wearing curtains.  I know.  Whose daughter is that again?  Roosevelt.  Roosevelt.  Roosevelt.  Who's number one on this website?  Oh, look at her.  She's not bad.  You know, I can't tell.  Every girl from that era looks like Lizzie Borden. 
[00:12:30]  Huh?  The blonde Bush daughter is number one.  Really?  The blonde Jenna Bush is number one, huh?  According to the site.  And then you go Trisha Nixon.  Susan Ford.  Let's go with Susan Ford.  Punch up Susan Ford.  Let's see what she looks like.  I don't know if I remember what Susan Ford looked like.  Susan Ford.  Oh, yeah.  She's not bad.  She's not bad.  In that 60s, 70s kind of look that she had going for herself back then. 
[00:13:00]  We don't need to see pictures of what she looks like today.  Yeah, yeah.  That's terrible.  What's wrong with you?  It's painful.  All right.  She ain't bad.  All right.  For a president that wasn't elected, by the way.  No, it's true.  Yeah.  I don't know if she actually technically fits.  Barbara Bush is coming in at number four.  Yep.  I would have moved her up the list.  I would have moved her up the list.  Way up the list.  Better than Susan Ford.  She might be my number one.  And then number five, Alice Roosevelt Longworth. 
[00:13:30]  Name alone just really doesn't enfoke sexuality.  Patty Davis.  Patty Davis.  Patty Davis Reagan.  Is that it?  Yeah.  That's it?  Just top five?  Because most of them are ugly.  Yeah, there really hasn't been that many.  Most of them are really ugly.  Yeah.  Amy Carter looked like Sammy Hagar.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Oh, look at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's picture there.  Yeah.  Let me see that.  She looks like a fucking, she looks like an 80s singer. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, it looks like maybe a young Boy George or something, right?  You know what?  Or like a young...  You'd have to throw a stick into Alice Roosevelt Longworth.  Oh, that's Teddy Roosevelt's daughter.  Really?  Ah.  Yeah, she looks boyish.  And his first doomed wife.  Oh, what became of her?  She looks like...  I'm sure it was some horrible consumption thing.  Yeah, some disease we cured many years ago.  She looks...  She doesn't look that bad.  You can't tell.  That black and white picture. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  And she probably had daddy issues.  He was always away hunting.  Yeah.  I like that.  Ah, we can't talk about the Obama daughters yet.  Relax.  What?  Relax.  They're a little young.  That shit would get us in trouble.  Yeah, you just got to see once they get a little older.  Yeah.  But people speculated on Amy Carter, if she was going to, you know, turn into that ugly duckling  thing and turn into a beautiful swan.  Amy Carter never turned it around.  Can I see what she looks like today?  Turned into a vulture. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, let's see what she looks like today.  Amy Carter.  Amy Carter.  Oh, God.  If she doesn't look like a fucking...  Those are other Amy Carters, right?  They have to be.  Okay.  Because there's some hot Amy Carters when you Google image Amy Carter.  Look at her fucking eyes and her head.  She looks like an inbred...  Oh, my God.  She looks horrendous.  Oh, man.  She's got them glossies on.  She looks horrible.  She looks like Edgar Winter's daughter.  Yes.  Or Jonathan Winter.  Or Jonathan Winter.  Johnny Winter. 
[00:15:30]  Edgar.  Which one was the one that was very albino-ish?  Because she looks like his daughter.  Oh, my God.  And there's a bunch of people that just are supposedly, you know, look like her.  Yeah.  Man, she wasn't...  She could win ugliest.  She could win ugliest first daughter.  Oh, it's not even...  It's not even...  Oh, my God.  Yikes.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  She is...  She never got...  She's terrible.  She never even went through a cute phase or a, wow, okay, she's shaping up a little. 
[00:16:00]  Wasn't Jimmy's...  Jimmy's...  Jimmy Carter's wife, she wasn't...  Rosalind Carter, was that the grandma?  Oh, no, she was bad.  Or was it the other one?  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then...  Never mind.  Yeah, Clinton, Chelsea, she was funny looking when she got in, into office there, when her  father got into office.  And then she kind of started gussying up a bit.  Now she just kind of looks very Hillary-like.  She's not bad looking.  She's not bad.  She got them big teeth and... 
[00:16:30]  You would definitely go there.  She's not bad at all.  Well, you'd have to go there, you know, just for the story.  Well, then you would have to go with Amy Carter for the story, because Amy Carter would  be a better story.  You think?  If you want to talk about stories, yes.  You think?  If you're doing a broad for the story, you've got to go all in.  So you go Amy.  Yeah, that right there.  See her with the googly eyes up top?  One more over that.  That picture is a Hillary picture.  Yeah.  Her big...  She's opening her eyes wide.  She's smiling.  That's a Daily News Hillary picture.  Of course.  They love those. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  So Romney did sort of okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He did sort of okay.  He pulled out the wins.  I guess Georgia went to Gingrich.  Right.  They knew that was going to happen.  Santorum took, what, four states?  I learned something about the Rush Limbaugh thing I want to bring to attention.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I think a lot of people were right when they were tweeting me about the whole Rush Limbaugh 
[00:17:30]  thing.  What do you mean?  Well, I think who we really need to blame here, because they keep saying no one is throwing  Rush off the air officially.  You are never to blame.  But it's the heat he's feeling from the advertisers and the heat he's feeling from radio stations  dropping them.  Yeah.  So I think those are the two things we've got to focus on.  Yeah.  I don't like the fact that a show can be thrown off the air because advertisers get all skittish.  Yeah.  I don't like that either. 
[00:18:00]  That's the mob tactic, the fear that they put in here.  And there's got to be a way to fight that as broadcasters and as listeners of radio shows.  So I didn't disagree with some of these people because they're like, look, man, we have the  right to complain, and the advertisers have a right to yank the show.  And I guess I have to agree with those people.  They do have the right.  But when we started on radio, you never even thought twice of an advertiser fucking up your 
[00:18:30]  radio show and getting you kicked off the air.  It wasn't even a possibility.  No, no.  Think about it.  It was never a possibility because basically the advertisers would advertise on a show,  and that's all they had to worry about because the show itself had rules.  And they were FCC rules.  And so the advertisers were like, okay, boom, we like Opie and Anthony.  There's rules in place.  Everyone's safe.  But somewhere along the way, and I think it happened about 10 years ago, that wasn't the 
[00:19:00]  case anymore.  Yeah.  Because you remember, we used to be like, oh, we're not going to get in trouble.  That didn't break an FCC regulation.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, something turned where it didn't matter about FCC regulations anymore.  You knew you were safe in that place, but now you had to worry about advertisers.  Yeah, it became a weird thing.  And special interest groups.  Yep.  So I guess a lot of those people got to me, and they're right.  But I don't like that.  I don't either.  And I don't think it should be that way.  I don't think these companies should get so goddamn skittish. 
[00:19:30]  It all had to do with ratings.  The advertisers just gave a shit about the ratings.  And if you were a high-rated show, they would advertise with you.  They knew that if you fucked up so bad that they had to pull their ad, you were going  to be fired anyway because you broke a rule that was in place, an FCC rule or something  like that.  So they never had to worry about it.  But even in those cases, Howard's a classic example, and we certainly are, where we did  get fined a lot.  Yeah.  And we weren't thrown off the air. 
[00:20:00]  No, cost of doing business.  And the advertisers were okay with that as well.  But now it's like it doesn't matter if you just follow FCC regulations.  Now an advertiser or advertisers could get your show kicked off.  I don't like that.  So I think we got to focus on that more.  And we got to focus on these guys that run these radio stations that are supposedly dropping  their show.  The biggest problem is that the, and we've said it ad nauseum, the normal listener, the  people that enjoy the program, aren't active. 
[00:20:30]  They're not loud.  They're just passive listeners.  And if something happens to your show that you like or advertisers start leaving, they're  not active.  They don't say, hey, advertiser.  You pull out of the show.  You had some minority of people that said, I don't believe you're advertising with this  motherfucker.  Pull your advertising or we're going to boycott your product.  And they go, ah, well, how about fucking 100 times more people than that, that enjoy 
[00:21:00]  the show, tell the advertiser, if you pull out, we'll fucking boycott your show.  But they don't do that.  No, I know.  And that's the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think advertisers have way too much power when it comes to radio.  Advertisers do.  And it was never like that.  They do have to realize that there's a lot more people that like the show than are pissed  with the show when something goes down like this Rush thing.  Right.  And that when you pull the sponsorship.  Right.  You're doing it because of just a few people. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  That are outraged.  Yeah.  I would love to take some kind of poll and see how many actual Rush Limbaugh listeners  are pissed off.  Yeah.  I bet you that number is very, very low.  So then shouldn't that dictate?  Tate, that the show should stick around.  Yeah.  It didn't break any FCC regulations.  Right.  And the advertisers should relax and go, oh, okay, this is what's going on.  All right.  Just fucking relax.  But.  So some of the people were right.  Relax.  But I think they were also confused.  You know, I think advertisers just simply should not have that much power. 
[00:22:00]  No.  I don't know how you get past that, though, because we're in a different world.  And then you get the skittish companies that fucking shut down everything as soon as there's  one little sign of trouble.  Yeah.  But in the old days when we were doing radio, a little sign of trouble meant, fuck, meant  bigger, bigger ratings, bigger audiences.  Right.  Which meant you could spend, you could charge more for advertising.  Yeah.  That was the big, that was the game.  But for some reason now you get that feeling of, uh-oh, there's a little problem. 
[00:22:30]  They shut everyone down.  That was the game.  You just.  Bunch of pussies.  Did shit, got some recognition, and you got some ratings off of it.  Right.  And the advertisers came on board.  Now, yeah, the idea that advertisers now have a say over what you can listen to, that's  what it boils down to.  Right.  They're the ones that say, hey, you could listen to this, or if we choose to, you won't  listen to it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't like it at all. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, but that's where we're at today.  So, because once again, we'll say that, I mean, Rush didn't break any FCC regulations.  No, not at all.  He said horrible things about that woman.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  And the fact that some people think it's.  Yeah, you could be offended.  Yeah.  The fact that some people think that's an FCC violation is amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she has every right to sue him and all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Every right.  We'll see what happens with that.  But yeah, he said awful things.  Yeah.  Guess what?  I love hearing awful things on the radio from time to time.  It's great.  It's fun.  I don't have to agree with him either. 
[00:23:30]  I get me pissed off, but I don't, I don't want a show kicked off because I'm pissed off  about what I heard.  No.  I just don't want that.  But some people really want that.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  And you talk to these people and you're running back and you realize they don't, they're not  even fans of the show of Rush Limbaugh, I mean.  No.  They hear things.  They hear things or hear one clip on the news and they're like, oh, that show's got to  go away.  Yeah.  And to me, that's just crazy talk, I think.  I really do.  So, yeah, I'm not, I'm definitely not a big fan of the way things have gone. 
[00:24:00]  I know.  Yeah.  But I just want to explain, because I think a lot of people didn't make a good point to  like, look, you know, we have the right to complain.  We have the right to complain to advertisers.  I'm like, you know what?  Those people are right.  Because that's, that's, that's kind of part of freedom of speech as well.  So I just don't, I just don't like how skittish some of these companies are and how they pull  their ads quickly.  Yeah.  When shit goes down.  Because then that panics the, the, the radio stations and the, and the radio companies. 
[00:24:30]  And the next thing you know, they just get rid of shit without even really thinking it  through.  And it, it makes for, um, just a horrid milk toasty, uh, environment out there where there's  no more surprises.  There's no spontaneity.  There's no real edgy humor.  It just becomes shite.  I was, uh, driving around Rochester a lot when I went up there with, um, Norton and,  uh, my, my rental, it did have satellite, but I'm like, I know I, I got that.  Yeah.  I'm in a, I'm in a new city or a city I haven't been in a while. 
[00:25:00]  I'm going to just fucking a little sample.  I'm going to do a, yeah, I'm going to do radio for three straight days.  I'm telling you, it is a fucking bore fest out there and it's happening in every city.  And that's why we yell and scream because, you know, just because of what happened with  Rush, there's, uh, there's other radio shows suffering the consequences right now, right  now there's being called into meetings and being told what they, the new list of shit  that they can't do or say.  I will guarantee dozens of shows easily have, have sat down since the Rush Limbaugh thing 
[00:25:30]  with their bosses and are now told don't ever use the word slut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why you fight this shit.  New word that you can't use slut, but they're saying don't use slut, don't use whore, don't  use floozy because you know how this shit goes.  It's not just the one word.  It's everything, every word that might be close to slut now has to be off the table.  Cause now on top of all that, the lawyers now have to justify their jobs with the radio  company, so they come up with a list of words that are like slut that you now can't say. 
[00:26:00]  That's why I, it stinks.  That's why I wish more people just saw it our way.  I, you know, exactly.  If you don't, that's, you know, we know I'm going to do, I'm not going to change your mind,  but that's the consequences.  It really, it really fucks up, um, other radio shows that you probably like listening to.  Yeah.  But, and you have no idea that it, that the Rush thing will affect what you like listening  to.  Yeah.  And that's what gets me with these, uh, people that are, uh, up in arms about Rush and saying 
[00:26:30]  he should be fired.  Uh, it really isn't out of the realm of possibility that whatever you like listening to or watching,  uh, will be yanked off the air because, uh, they do something that somebody doesn't like.  And then you'll be sitting there going, wait a minute.  Why?  Right.  And it's the exact same thing that's happening.  It goes back to, uh, Rush.  It goes back to Imus.  It goes back to JV and Elvis.  Right.  It goes back to all these guys that have gotten in a lot of trouble over the years.  It goes back to us. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And the shit we did.  Yeah.  We're thrown in that mix.  Oh my God.  I mean, I'm sure we were the result.  Uh, we resulted in quite a few meetings that people had to sit in on.  Of course.  Yeah.  So, and then Obama.  Because a lot of people think I'm an Obama guy.  I'm not an Obama guy.  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a no government guy at this point.  Anarchy.  Anarchy, basically.  Pure anarchy.  Um, but Obama getting involved with this.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what the fuck, right?  And now he's getting his daughters involved. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You saw this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got the clip here.  Obama had, uh, had his first press conference, I guess, of the new year.  Mm-hmm.  God, it's really, the president is having his first press conference in March?  Yeah, not much has happened.  Oh, wait, that's right.  That's crazy.  Why is that?  Why do you wait so long?  I, I think unless he has to talk about something.  Um, he knows it could just be used as fodder against him in an election year, so they tend  to shut the fuck up during the, uh, election year.  If I'm president, though, I already got the gig. 
[00:28:00]  I'm doing a press conference every Friday.  Every day?  Or every Friday?  Once a week.  Because you know what?  You know all the networks, all the news stations have to go with you, and you could, you just,  you could just sit in front of a fuck.  Oh, and just get that FaceTime.  Right.  Yeah.  And they never cut out, they never cut the president off.  No.  So he could be up there just bullshitting for two hours once a week.  And, uh, what else happened?  What else?  What else?  He goes to a stool with notes on it.  Right.  Yeah, let me see.  Just going to try out some new stuff here today, if you don't mind, press core. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, I would just talk about Jeremy Lin.  How about that, huh?  And how he's becoming an average ball player at this point.  Now he's just a guy.  Oops.  Oops.  Uh, above average, but.  Yeah.  The Linsanity is, uh, not so insane these days.  Well, Linsanity kind of calming down a little.  A little bit.  It's, uh, yeah.  They lost to the Mavericks.  It's treatable.  Linsanity's treatable.  Yeah, yeah.  There's definitely.  There's some medication and, uh, some, uh, anxiety exercises. 
[00:29:00]  You're not going to be Linsane.  There's definitely some chinks in that armor.  Let's be honest with each other.  See?  See?  See, we're going to say it here, Sam.  The lawyers are, uh.  We're going to say it here, Sam.  Already making lists.  It's a real term.  It's a real term.  Okay.  And I'm noticing there's some chinks in the armor there.  Whoa.  Oh, no.  His defense isn't as strong.  It's already people you're getting.  His, uh.  He's got to cut down on those turnovers a little bit.  He's got to, uh, he's got to stop picking up his dribble.  These are some of the, uh, chinks in his armor.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, no.  Is that bad?  That's terrible.  People have been fired for less.  It's, uh, just awful.  But as we were discussing today, we don't even know if we have bosses at this point.  I have no idea what's going on.  There's all sorts of rumors behind the scenes.  I haven't seen a real boss in, uh, I don't know, since Christmas, I think.  Oh, boy.  I, I truly believe that we could go home now, put on a best of, and no one will even question it.  We just have to close the curtains.  Oh, yeah.  Make believe something's going on and keep the red light on.  Yeah, the old Wizard of Oz strategy.  That's right.  Can we do Wizard of Oz? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, don't mind to the guy working the board behind the curtain.  Yeah.  I would be the guy.  Like, everybody would think it was the great and powerful Opie and Anthony, but it was just  stupid Sam back there with a button.  Stupid Sam.  Yeah.  You're, you're, uh, fellow, uh, Syracuse alum, uh, alumnus?  Yeah.  Is that how you say that?  Alumni.  Why not alumnus?  If you had the power to go home all the time, click your heels three times and call Kenny 
[00:30:30]  to get your truck.  Let's try this.  Oh, that works.  Let's try this.  Wizard of Oz show.  Let's try it.  Carmelo Anthony's fucking up the chemistry of the Knicks there, Sam.  Ever since he got back, um, Lynn hasn't been, Lynn's being a little too polite.  The coach doesn't know what to do.  It's, it's a whole chemistry thing they're trying to figure out.  I guess Lynn's not used to being a star in Carmelo.  Anthony is just like, Anthony was, Carmelo, uh, had a horrible night of shooting last night.  Horrible.  Four for, I don't know, 20 or something like that. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Anyway, here's Obama talking about, uh, the Russ Limbaugh thing and why he called the  girl and why is he getting involved?  Get, get our gas prices down.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Four bucks a gallon.  Uh, and you're calling a girl and it's not summer yet.  Can you help us out?  Do you believe Russ Limbaugh's apology, um, to the Georgetown lawsuit was sufficient and  heartfelt?  Do you agree with the decision of the growing number of sponsors that have decided to drop 
[00:31:30]  the show, stop supporting the show?  And has there been a double standard on this issue?  Liberal commentators have made similarly provocative, um, or distasteful statements and there hasn't  been such an outrage.  You know, I'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to do.  I'm not going to comment on, uh, uh, either the economics or the politics of it.  Uh, I don't know what's in Russ Limbaugh's heart, so I'm not going to comment on, uh, the 
[00:32:00]  sincerity of his apology.  Uh, what I can comment on is the fact that, uh, uh, uh, all decent folks can agree, uh, that  the remarks that were made, uh, don't have any place in the public discourse.  Oh my God.  Yeah, they do have a place, by the way.  They certainly do.  If a girl's a slut, uh, you call her slut.  So there is a place for it.  Whether it was appropriate or not, how Rush used it, uh, is debatable.  Um, but yeah, Obama, and I'm not even, you know something, uh, uh, mark down your calendar. 
[00:32:30]  Uh, I'm, I'm gonna, uh, throw Obama, uh, a prop here and, uh, not bash him on why he's  talking about this because the press fucking can't stop asking dumb questions about shit  like this, popular culture, uh, the, the latest, uh, wacky craze.  And they asked, because he was asked, he didn't just get up there and start talking  about Rush and stuff.  Uh, the stupid press has to get up there and ask him that shit. 
[00:33:00]  I don't have any place in the public discourse.  Discourse.  And.  Or dead course.  You know, the reason I called, uh, Ms. Float is because.  Ms. Float.  Uh, I thought about.  I was hoping to get some.  Uh, I was hoping, uh, get some of that white ass.  Hoping to get some.  I thought about Malia and Sasha and one of the things I want them to do, uh, as they 
[00:33:30]  get older.  Is not be as lucky.  Is to engage in issues they care about.  Even ones I may not agree with them on.  What?  I want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way.  Um, and I don't want them attacked, uh, or, or called, uh, horrible names because they're  being good citizens.  And I wanted, uh, Sandra to know that. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, but we'll always have that, right?  Well.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  I was going to say unfortunately, but we'll always have that.  Yes, we will.  We'll always have people commenting on stuff that's going on in the public eye, no?  Uh, yes, the, uh, yeah, yeah.  Well, well, what's your deal?  Nothing, nothing.  I know when to keep my mouth shut.  What am I doing wrong?  No, no, me, me, me.  I just, I, this is one of those instances where a joke goes through.  Oh.  Let me, let me take you on the inside, people.  Yeah, I saw something going on in your head.  It's one of these instances.  I know.  You saw the wheels spinning? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Because I was trying to figure out a way to word a joke where it wouldn't get me fucked  in this environment.  This is exactly what we're talking about, people.  And I couldn't figure it out, so I just dropped it.  It was, it was, uh, you know, a little word play I was, I was going to go on.  And, uh, when you're dealing with the first daughters and, uh, things as such, I, I just  figured I'd keep my mouth shut.  And there you go.  Yeah.  And that's because you're a little scared.  Yeah.  A little scared and a little more experienced in this biz.  Because of what happened to us in past years and what is happening now with Rush. 
[00:35:00]  Right, right, right, right, right.  So you, you, you get, uh, radio guys that get a little scared.  See?  A little, little, little scared right there.  It's on her to know that, uh, that I thought her parents should be proud of her.  Uh, and that we want to send a message to all our young people that, uh, being part of  a democracy involves argument and disagreements and, uh, debate. 
[00:35:30]  And we want you to be engaged and there's a way to do it, uh, that doesn't, uh, uh, involve,  uh, you being, uh, uh, demeaned and insulted, uh, particularly when you're a private citizen.  God.  What happened to the keynote speaker at the Democratic, uh, convention?  I don't know.  Wow.  Where's that guy?  I don't know.  That was all over the place.  That was a rambling fucking trying to check every word he said kind of a thing. 
[00:36:00]  Uh, you know, I, I don't have a problem with him, I guess, calling fluke, but he also should  explain how, like, radio works too.  And how are you going to be?  I don't have a problem with the calling, but the sexting now.  The sexting.  That got a little out of hand.  Oh.  But you got to explain, like, freedom of speech and shit too as the president.  I think that's your responsibility.  You're that close to the constitution.  Maybe explain to some of these dummies what went on with Rush.  Yeah, be offended, obviously, but defend his right to say it. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, they would never do that.  I know they'll never do that.  Yeah, not for Rush.  That's for sure.  Uh, no, I know.  Let me go to Atlanta.  Hot ladder.  Adam, what's up?  Atlanta.  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Adam.  Hey, you know, this whole freedom of speech thing, it's driving me a little crazy.  I mean, you know, the SEC rules are one thing, but the ability to say what you want, you guys  were talking to a guy yesterday, I listened on the replay, a fellow named Frank. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And this guy was so ambiguous about what he was trying to say, he's the kind of guy that  would goose step up to a Nazi book burning and just to warm his hands.  But now you care about what's actually going on, you know?  Yeah, I was bothered by Frank's call, but that's how he thinks, and he has the right  to think that way.  You know, that's Frank.  Frank was better.  That's freedom of speech, too, I guess.  Yeah, ultimately.  But, you know, the whole thing is, if you're going to take a stand, take a stand.  I think you guys, I just recently got satellite radio, you guys are the show I've been waiting 
[00:37:30]  for.  Right.  As far as freedom of speech goes.  Well, we're pretty much alone.  Austin, I think, believe it or not, it's going to kill Anthony when I say this, but Bill Maher.  Bill Maher is fucking all about this.  Bill Maher tweeted this.  Hate to defend Rush Limbaugh, but he apologized.  Liberals looking bad, not accepting.  Hate intimidation by sponsor.  That's where we're at.  Yeah.  We hate that the sponsors have all this power, and it shouldn't be that way. 
[00:38:00]  Well, he didn't like the fact that he was being used as the example also.  He said some horrible things about women.  Sarah Palin.  Republican women, Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  So Bill Maher said some horrible things and wasn't apologetic about it at all.  Right.  And then you find out he's one of the biggest contributors to Obama.  You know, it kind of looks hypocritical and silly if he didn't come out in support of Rush.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  But he did.  I mean, good for him.  He could have kind of hid.  A lot of people are hiding out there.  I don't know.  He can't hide his head in the sand, though.  There's not enough sand.  His big fucking head.  Wow, we really talk the same sometimes.  We haven't lost that chemistry, man.  No.  All these years later.  It's amazing.  All these years.  All these fucking years.  Yeah.  What else, Adam?  If you look at the average point of view, you get the salesmen who look at the sensationalism  of any kind of foul comment, if you want to go that way, and say, well, this is going 
[00:39:00]  to be great.  This is going to be great.  But the big guys up above start panicking and going, we're going to lose customers.  Yeah.  And they're the ones who make the call, not the salesmen, you know?  Yeah.  We used to laugh when it did start changing.  We're like, we don't have to.  I remember, I'm like, wait, not only do we have to worry about FCC rules, now we've got  to worry about pissing off special interest groups, advertisers, even program directors. 
[00:39:30]  This goes back to Dave Douglas, who forced us to do stuff and would edit some of our shit  because he personally didn't like what we were talking about.  Yeah.  Practices kind of guy, right?  Yeah.  But it's like, that's not your job.  Your job is to keep us safe with the FCC, not your personal taste.  Well, do me a favor, guys.  Just ignore them and fucking blow it out your asses because I love it every day, man.  Thanks, Adam.  I appreciate that.  But I mean, I've been thinking about this a lot and it's really time that we push back 
[00:40:00]  with the advertisers somehow.  Yeah.  I think it's the only way.  They got way too much fucking power and you're not going to get the pushback from the radio  companies and management.  No, not at all.  So the listeners got to somehow get involved.  If they like a show out there, they got to get together.  They really do.  Yeah.  I'm paying for it every month, so I dig it.  But I'm not even talking about us because we don't really deal with advertisers.  We have like four advertisers.  If they went away, we're still here. 
[00:40:30]  And they're not going anywhere.  Nah.  There's Steven Singer going, for God's sake.  The problem is if it's going out over here to the people who don't necessarily want to  hear it, there's a little knob on the freaking radio.  Wow.  You just turn the goddamn channel.  Well, Adam.  You're a knob.  You would think that's all you would have to tell people.  But for some reason, that's so not good enough.  It used to be like, look, if you don't like what you hear, change the station.  We hear it from our own listeners.  Like, ah, you bored me today.  I went to fucking the Pearl Jam channel.  And you got to go, Mom.  See what I did there? 
[00:41:00]  That's why I sit on the couch with the remote control on their laps, man.  If you don't like what they're watching, they click the channel, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  Imagine like going, you're at home, you're sitting, you're watching TV.  You put a show on, the remote's right there next to you, and you don't like the show that's  on.  So instead of changing the channel, you call the cable company and you start complaining  about the show that's on and the advertisers.  You want to call them.  And instead of just going, ah, let me just see what's on.  I'm learning that there's a lot of people that will do just that. 
[00:41:30]  I know, it's ridiculous.  Who has time to do that?  Dummies.  Well, man, if I ever got to that point, I had a remote in one hand and a gun in the  other hand, I'd put one of them in my mouth.  There you go.  All right, Adam.  I'm sure I'm going to climb a hill here.  You guys stay out of trouble.  All right.  Thanks, Adam.  Adam in Atlanta, a newer listener.  34 companies have pulled advertising from Russia's show.  Really?  That many?  Bunch of pussies.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  If they're pulling, we better pull our advertising.  Oh, my God.  And they're pulling it? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, boy.  We better pull ours.  Yeah.  Fucking panicky Pete's.  They are.  It's giving them much too much power.  It's the bottom line.  Right.  They shouldn't have the power to decide what you listen to or watch.  Right.  And they do.  They have that power.  I heard Carbonite's stock, and they've advertised on our show over the years.  I heard their stock dropped yesterday.  And a lot of people are trying to make the connection that their stock dropped because  of them dropping their advertising with Rush Limbaugh.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  But then again, the stock market, like you told me, had a bad day yesterday.  Yeah, it was a pretty bad one.  But certainly a lot of people are writing, you know, they think it has something to do  with Rush, dropping their ads with Rush, and the investors are getting involved and  going, oh, really?  Taking their money out.  I think it had more to do with the giant loss yesterday in the market and the biggest  one of the year so far.  So, yeah, I don't know.  I'd like to think that it was a response to Rush, but why not the other sponsors? 
[00:43:00]  Right, right.  I don't know.  Who knows?  We'll see.  But that's where we're at.  Anyone else defending Rush that we know of?  The American Nazi Party, I think, came out.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, always good to have those guys in your pocket.  I don't know.  I want to just do a couple phones here.  Let's go to the Bronx.  We haven't talked to the Bronx in a while.  Gary, what's up?  What's up, Al?  I wanted to know, like, are there people besides the non-listeners to the Rush Limbaugh show 
[00:43:30]  that want the ads pulled?  And I'm like, I listen to your show.  You have certain advertisers.  Like, if I'm listening, that means I like what you're doing.  So why would I want your advertisers to pull their advertising?  Yeah, I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  No.  What you need to do is you need some kind of poll to see how many actual Rush Limbaugh fans  are pissed off with the fact that he called Sandra Fluke a slut.  That's where you've got to go. 
[00:44:00]  I also think there's something when the advertisers pull their spots.  That they're trying to present themselves as the moral high ground.  Right.  So it's not even so much like, well, people are outraged.  I'm afraid of a boycott.  They look at it as a plus to go like, ah, you know what?  If we pull our ads, we could present ourselves like we're this moral fucking icon.  Also, they do it to get the headline.  Right, right.  Also, there's their logo on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, your local news, you know, the big whatever logo. 
[00:44:30]  I don't even want to mention it.  And then a week later, they could just go back and advertise on the show quietly.  And they get free advertising.  There's their logo everywhere.  Yeah.  And I know some sponsors do just that.  Yeah, yeah.  They're not dumb.  They're like, oh, fuck, we could use this to market ourselves right now.  It's just stupid.  Well, I mean, it is stupid because what ends up happening is people that don't listen to  these radio shows are the ones that usually get the show kicked off the air. 
[00:45:00]  It's never the hardcore listeners that support the show and give it ratings that get a show  taken off the air.  Very rare.  Extremely rare.  Well, I love you guys and I will fight for you no matter what happens.  So make sure you guys keep yourselves on the air.  Oh, it's too late for us, sir.  It's okay.  Oh, it's just much too late.  When you see these young guns coming up, just remember some of the stuff we told you.  Just remember us.  Just remember us in your prayers.  In your prayers.  All right.  All right, Gary. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you, man.  What did you do last night?  Anything at?  I was watching the Knicks and I was watching Super Tuesday.  Anything fun?  I had my buddy, you know, Joe Curry.  Sure.  He does a podcast with his buddy Davin down in the compound facilities.  Nice.  And Davin is such a liberal.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You allow that in your house?  I know.  I know.  What's wrong with you?  I sit there because I monitor what's going on, just kind of sit. 
[00:46:00]  I'm off camera and stuff.  But they say things and I just chime in.  I can't help.  Imagine like you have a network of radio shows and the guy just sits there and busts in every  so often and goes, that's stupid.  I couldn't take it, though.  Talking about everything.  Gun issues.  But you didn't censor them.  No, I didn't censor them.  But I was really getting, like, incensed at some of this stuff.  Because this first hour would have been a waste of time if you said, well, I got a button  at the bar. 
[00:46:30]  And when I don't like his liberal bullshit, I'm just censoring them.  I censor people.  I'm going to pull my own advertising from that program.  God, you're, yeah, you're, uh, yeah, man, see, it was, um, this goes to what we're saying.  Yeah, exactly.  You could so easily censor the kid.  I could say, hey, get out of your fucking house.  How about you get the fuck out of my house?  Right.  I could say that.  Right.  Yeah.  That's my equivalent of me pulling sponsorship.  Right.  Get the fuck out of my house.  But, I mean, eventually you would say, get the fuck out of my house because maybe the 
[00:47:00]  podcast isn't working.  Yeah.  But at least you're giving him a shot and you don't care what he's talking about.  But it's such a lot of, like, just liberal ideology.  A lot of hilarious.  Obama is infallible.  The Republicans are responsible for the ills of the world.  And, uh, and I just sit there going like her, but, uh, yeah, forces you to get on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that pumps up his show a little bit.  That's it.  Uh, but yeah, that's pretty much, uh, what I was doing last night.  And then, you know, the usual, uh, uh, going through the, the, my DVR to see what I have 
[00:47:30]  on that, which nowadays, remember when you used to know what you recorded?  Sure.  You're like, oh, I record.  Now the DVR is like another channel guide.  Right.  You go through and go, oh, I wonder what's on.  Right.  It's like, wait, I recorded this.  I have no idea.  I don't know why I recorded that.  I don't even remember recording that.  That's kind of nice.  Yeah.  And then, uh, it's, but they're always the same shows.  It's Hoarders, which, uh, is great.  I love that.  Any new Hoarders to me is a gold intervention. 
[00:48:00]  Any crime shows, anytime a teen is killed, um, and, uh, there's a police show about it.  I'm there.  Uh, you know, great stuff like that.  That's because the teen girl looked hot.  Uh, sometimes there's, uh, ugly teens that get killed.  Oh, yeah.  What's the turn on?  I changed the channel.  I don't even know how that works.  Okay.  I talked, I took the kid to see that Dr. Seuss yesterday.  Oh, yeah, the lol, the lolmax, the lolrax, the lol, what is it called? 
[00:48:30]  Uh, lolrax, I think.  The lolrax.  Um, visually, wow.  Yeah.  Wow, this movie looks terrific.  Yeah.  But you fucking parents out there, fuck all of you.  Because you're not, you're not teaching me about parenting at all.  What are you supposed to be, like, supposed to teach?  Well, my kid's what?  Almost two.  So I'm like, the movie's 5.15.  I'm like, I gotta get a good seat.  So I show up at 4.45.  Do you understand how hard it is to keep a kid preoccupied for a half hour before the previews start? 
[00:49:00]  Wow, yeah, that's probably a tough one.  Yeah, that's probably really rough.  And then the previews start, and the movie doesn't even start until 5.30, so now I've  already been in the theater 45 minutes, and there weren't a lot of people in there, so  I just let them wander around and climb on seats for a half hour.  And then finally, um, they, they start their whole presentation with, with real estate ads  for a kid movie, I'm like, will you, will you pre, will you get the kids interested before 
[00:49:30]  I lose this one?  That's a good point, because why the, why wouldn't they put something that, uh, the kids could  find entertaining?  And, and, and, and as soon as you go in the theater with a kid, the, the, the clock is ticking.  You only have.  It's like a time bomb.  You only have an hour, an hour and a half.  I didn't see the end of, uh, The Lorax.  Oh, you didn't?  No, and I knew I wasn't going to.  Yeah.  But here's.  The Lorax, by the way, is dead the whole movie.  Hate to be a spoiler, dead the whole movie, didn't even know it.  Now I don't have to go back.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  But I know that I only got an hour to an hour and a half, but I want to take the kid.  He kind of seems to like movies already, but fuck man, I should have went at five 15.  That's when the real preview start.  Cause when the re the real preview started, not the real estate ads and the ads for fucking  restaurants and the ads for a Joseph and the technical technical or dream, whatever.  Finally, when the real preview started, this kid was focused, but he was already tired 
[00:50:30]  now.  So now I'm like, oh, great.  Long story short, halfway through the movie, he's, he's had it.  And he, he told me he was done cause he got out of his seat and just started walking out  of the theater.  He's like, yeah.  22 months.  Come on.  I'm done.  Let's go.  He goes bye-bye to the whole audience and starts walking away.  I'm like, I guess we're done with this movie.  But the parents out there, help me out.  Help me out here.  I don't know this shit, you know, it's a odd about, uh, remind me of something here  with the, with the movies.  I've always been in a neurotic, uh, insane rush when I, I, uh, have to go to the movies. 
[00:51:00]  I, I'm rushing.  I'm like, ah, we're going to miss the movie.  Ah, we're going to miss.  Ah, ah, ah.  I've never once in every movie I've ever been to my entire life, missed the beginning of  a movie.  Right.  So, because if it says 515 on, on the website, I was going to say the paper that would have  dated me.  Yeah.  On the website, that means the previews start.  You've got a 15 minute window. 
[00:51:30]  Bill, why don't you tell me what you'd like to.  You've got a 15 minute window easy.  Yeah.  That's just like flying too, by the way.  You know when you panic to get to the airport?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then you get there and, and then.  It is so rare to miss your flight because it never takes off on time.  Because you are late.  Right.  Yeah.  Never.  And you always allow yourself enough time, but even if that time is cut down, you're  panicking and you get to the airport and what do we all do?  We sit in that stupid seat just staring at our gate after panicking all morning.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Because, because there's plenty of buffer time.  Yeah.  Buffers.  So, I got to, I got to go to these movies like right at the time it says.  Yeah.  There's certain things you're just not going to be late for.  But, I mean, this is a kid's movie.  So, why the real estate ads?  They can't figure that shit out and, and maybe get some dumb shit on the screen where  the, they keep their attention.  People are so conditioned to get to certain places early.  Movies, the airport, doctor's office.  Have you ever gone to a doctor's office and, and the doctor goes, ah, sorry, you missed 
[00:52:30]  your appointment.  Never.  Ah, we were right here.  The appointment was five and it's 5.05 now.  Right.  You're five minutes late.  We called your name.  Right.  No, you're going to sit there for fucking at least 45 minutes.  Right.  But, you're always thinking like, ah, ah, I'm going to be late.  Well, now the dentist, I, I actually go 10 minutes late.  And then I walk in, they're like, oh, we're ready for you, sir.  I'm like, nice.  Just sit in that fucking room looking at people.  Uh, stupid Richie, uh, Rico, Poconos, don't bring a fucking two-year-old to a theater annoying 
[00:53:00]  for the rest of us.  Oh, really?  For, uh, for the Lorax.  Really?  For Dr. Seuss?  Yeah, really?  What an idiot.  Really?  Really?  And, and so far my kid is well-behaved and, and I've learned over the years what I want  from a kid.  I've learned.  Well, so have I.  Oh, wait, what?  Oh, boy.  So, Jesus.  When my kid acts up, because I don't have a perfect kid, no one has a perfect kid, guess  what I do?  I get them out of the fucking situation.  Yeah.  Immediately. 
[00:53:30]  I take them for a walk.  I've left restaurants in the middle of eating.  That's the smart move.  Right.  Because I fucking, you know.  Because I've learned.  Yeah.  I, I, I've sat there a million fucking times and there's been a screaming kid.  It drives me insane like anyone else.  You were a civilian for years.  You know what it's like.  So now I got a kid.  I'm like, oh, he's acting up.  That means somewhere, someone in this fucking restaurant is pissed off right now.  So I, I remove them from the situation.  Yeah.  I've had, I've had meals wrapped up halfway through all that shit.  So shut the fuck up, Richie. 
[00:54:00]  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Right.  I'm aware.  Unfortunately, a lot of parents aren't aware.  You remember the famous incident on the, on the plane in first class with the kid crying?  Well, that happens all the time now.  But this is the famous one where this kid is screaming bloody murder.  We're lucky enough to be in first class.  Nice, right?  Nice.  This kid is acting up because it wants candy.  The mom decides 35,000 feet in the air that she needs to teach him a, a lesson and will 
[00:54:30]  not give her the fucking candy.  And we're all just staring at the woman going, going, give him the fucking candy.  This isn't the place to fucking teach the kid about a candy, uh, uh, etiquette.  Right.  And, and, and when, and when not you get candy, right?  There's not even a question.  I would give my kid the candy at that point.  Even if he ate candy for eight straight hours, wrap some chocolate around a volume, 35,000  feet in the air is not the time to fucking, uh, you know, teach your kid a lesson. 
[00:55:00]  First class should really be a child free.  Sorry.  It should just be like a fucking, uh, can we start that rule after Friday?  Oh, right.  Okay.  After Friday, please.  Maybe April 1st.  Well, you can't put the kid like behind that curtain one seat back.  I don't disagree with you, but let me fly first and then, then we'll start that new  role.  Look around when you sit down and see if people in first class look and go, I'm more than  prepared to walk them up and down that aisle, whatever it takes, whatever it fucking takes. 
[00:55:30]  I've been there.  I don't want to, I don't want to be the guy that has the screaming kid.  Screaming kids.  One thing, um, uh, first class flying down to Florida for the cruise, uh, recently, you had  a kid.  The Akalugi guy was sitting right across the aisle.  This old fucking guy was going like, just fucking hacking up phlegm.  And it wasn't even, he wasn't even trying to be subtle about it.  It was disgusting. 
[00:56:00]  Disgusting.  We took video of it.  Did you?  Yeah, I got video of it.  Was he spitting into a cup or something?  Spitting into a fucking, uh, uh, tissue.  So let me see the video.  And then, well, it's part of the, uh, whole cruise thing.  Oh, you're still put together.  All right.  Good.  But this guy was spitting into a tissue.  And, uh, then when they bring over the hot towel that everybody washes there, like rubs  your hands down with, he fucking talked into it.  And I'm like, yeah, some kind of dry heaving. 
[00:56:30]  It's disgusting.  Old guy loogies gets, gets me every time.  Oh, horrible.  And here's horrible.  One more thing.  Yeah.  Do not wake your fucking kid up because you think the plane is going to land soon.  Holy fuck.  No.  When you could see the ground, we still have a good 15 minutes to go.  Let the fucking kid sleep.  How many times have you seen, how many times have you seen the mom try to start waking 
[00:57:00]  up the kid?  And then what do they, most kids, when they first wake up, start screaming because they're  like, what the fuck?  I was sleeping.  That's what I do every morning.  Right.  Because they don't know what the fuck is up.  Yeah.  And then their ears start popping and they don't know what it is.  All that shit.  Let them sleep.  The kid's like, ah, my head.  Let the, let the plane, you know, landing, um, wake them up.  Yeah.  I've had that before.  Oh, let's.  And then they're screaming right behind you.  Really? 
[00:57:30]  Uh, it's not his fault.  The movie's too long and kids have short attention spans.  No, it was my fault because I brought them way too fucking early.  You gotta time things out.  That's hilarious.  And here's, here's the thing.  I don't even know if, uh, a two year old supposed to be wearing 3d glasses.  So I had to go to the regular version.  Wow.  You actually thought of that?  Yeah.  I just slap it on the kid's face.  Here you go.  But then.  3d glasses.  But you take the glasses off.  Isn't everything really fucking blurry?  So I didn't know what to do. 
[00:58:00]  Is this going to be forever?  It's all blurry.  So I had to go to the regular version.  Cause none, none of these assholes out there helped me out with the parenting thing.  When is a kid allowed to wear 3d glasses?  If they could keep it on, if they could keep them on their face, is that the answer?  I think so.  Cause at Disney, they have a lot of those 3d things and, you know, and, and there's kids  in there with their 3d glasses on.  Yeah.  I think if it was the old red blue ones, maybe there's a problem there. 
[00:58:30]  But I mean, the kid knows how to fucking do the movie right though, man.  He sits there nice.  He knows.  Yeah.  He's got his cup holder.  No yapping.  Huh?  No yapping.  Oh man, look, I'll show you.  But it's not like this the whole time, but there he is.  Oh yeah.  He looks like a regular dude.  He's just kind of like sitting there shoving popcorn in his face.  He's like, yeah.  Watching a movie.  He likes pirate booty.  What?  It's called pirate booty.  What the fuck is that?  Sam, of course, knows what pirate booty is. 
[00:59:00]  He's probably, uh, probably still eating it.  Trader Joe's.  You still eat it, right?  To this day?  No.  It's a kid's thing, I think.  I don't eat it.  And he's on his booster sheet.  He's got his little juice cup and his pirate booty.  But unfortunately, he was set.  But that's what I'm saying.  He's set for maybe a half hour to 40 minutes.  But know what he's looking at right there?  And then he gets up and leaves.  A stupid real estate ad.  That's my problem.  Maybe he's going to flip some houses.  You never know.  Aged white cheddar.  They're puffs. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, the pirate's booty.  I haven't tried that shit yet.  Arr.  But he seems to like it.  I use my kid to get through lines quicker.  What?  Do you mind if I learn a little bit here?  Oh, please.  Jim in Philly, what's up?  I've been in situations where, you know, you're like in line.  You're waiting for something.  Or somebody's trying to get you to, like, watch a movie or something.  You're buying a car.  And, you know, my daughter started freaking out. 
[01:00:00]  Everybody in the office started moving back to her to get me through and out.  I don't know what he said.  I don't either.  I don't either.  What, the kid is what then?  What happened?  Crying.  Screaming.  Freaking out.  And how does that help you, sir?  Because everybody else just wants to get her out of there.  They just want to get you moved through the line and get you through and not deal with you and your kid.  Oh, so you allow them to scream and stuff?  Yeah, a little bit.  I've left lines.  I'm like, holy fuck, I was almost there. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, almost there.  But I have to leave the line.  I have to.  Yeah.  For the good of the many.  Yes.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  You heard that somewhere.  Jeff in Chicago.  I heard it was 70 in Chicago yesterday.  That's crazy.  Yeah, 70 in about 40 mile an hour winds.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Yeah, try taking your kid for a walk in that, which I did.  That's nuts.  I was going to say, you know what?  You're better off just reading your kid the Lorax, saving the money, you know, just pop yourself the popcorn. 
[01:01:00]  Who knows?  He might even fall asleep in the book, you know?  He enjoyed what he saw, you know, but his attention span is, you know, kid movies should be probably 40 minutes long.  40 minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much was it?  How much did you pay?  13 bucks.  But that was just for me.  Movies are now 13 bucks in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And then you had to pay.  Did you get any concessions, popcorn, soda, whatever?  No, I brought all my shit with me.  Okay.  Well, what?  Pirate booty? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Pirate booty.  If you need to know, I had a yogurt.  Oh, yogurt at the movie theater?  I was hungry and I, you know, I...  Twizzlers.  Get some Twizzlers.  Everybody knows the book is always better than the movie.  It's consistent even for, like, adult movies.  Dude, they're using some bright colors.  Visually, this movie looked fucking great.  I wanted to live in that town.  It was a cool town.  Take a hit of acid.  See that thing?  Would it be nice and colorful?  I love animated films.  Love them.  Right.  Those truffle of trees look mighty good. 
[01:02:00]  Once you...  Holler.  You know.  Don't you have something on the Rush thing, though?  Oh, well, you know what?  Don't the advertisers know sort of what they're getting into when they're advertising with Rush Limbaugh  that he's going to be outrageous?  You can't go into it thinking, oh, we'll just, you know, we'll just, you know, have, you know,  Rush plug our stuff and, you know, we don't worry about what he's going to say.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  They have to know.  Well, it says, wouldn't it be in the advertiser's best interest to not pull ads since people may 
[01:02:30]  agree with Rush?  That's a very good question.  The problem is there's an image thing, like, you know, a company that advertised with Rush  Limbaugh, they're also advertising everywhere, and they don't, all of a sudden, they don't  want their name associated with what Rush said because they're worried it's going to affect  them in other areas.  That's what that's about.  It just doesn't make sense that, you know, Rush is getting all this attention now because  he called this girl, you know, a slut and a prostitute.  Right.  You would figure that, at least for those Rush fans that aren't converted, more Rush fans, 
[01:03:00]  you know, there would be more Rush fans as a result, and it would be in the advertiser's  best interest to not pull their advertising because more listeners and more, you know, there'd  be more people, you know, listening to Rush, extolling the virtues of their products.  Yeah, there's more people tuning into Rush.  If I owned some shitty company, I would be buying ads on Rush Limbaugh right now.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't give a fuck.  Exactly.  Well, thanks for taking my call, guys. 
[01:03:30]  All right, man.  I would be buying.  3D movies are supposed to be six and up.  There you go, eh?  That's all I want to know.  Six and up?  I want to know some shit.  Oh, really?  So I don't have to figure this parenting out, stuff out by myself.  I think if you take them, you know, every day, it's probably a problem.  Maybe one day, you just throw some 3D glasses on a kid, I think you'd be fine.  You don't want them all googly-eyed, though, from going to see a 3D, one 3D movie.  A kid will not keep glasses on more than 10 seconds, though. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That's what the staple gun is for.  All right, I think we could take a little break here.  Charg.  We got Sam.  I know.  You don't have to.  I mean, you don't sound so disappointed.  What?  And we sounded very disappointed.  No.  Well, could you leave?  Like, we got Sam.  It's like, yeah, I know.  I mean, you, yeah, I'm employed.  You.  But could you leave?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Of course.  That's all you've been asking for.  It's up to you. 
[01:04:30]  Like, leave.  Right now?  Like, the building.  The show, the company.  Yes, I could do that.  Well, good.  That's all you've been wanting.  But you would have to put a formal request.  You're asking me to.  Why don't you.  The formal request is leave.  But I can't.  You have to have me fired.  No, just leave.  I'm not just going to quit.  I don't quit stuff.  But you'd have to have me fired.  All right.  You're fired.  Well, you would have.  No, you have to have me fired.  Yeah.  Fuck.  You can't.  You have to go through, like, Bladder and Gary and them and have me fired. 
[01:05:00]  I'm their boss.  You're fired.  Leave.  You can't fire me.  You have to have them fire me.  You want them fired or what?  Yeah, fuck them.  Yeah, but you guys can't have me fired.  You have to go through them.  Good luck with your wedding.  Now leave.  Oh, boy.  I mean, I appreciate the luck, but you can't fire me.  But you just said we could.  You can request that I be fired.  And we'd probably get our request.  Probably would.  Yeah, that you probably would.  So, in essence.  So, let's cut out the middle name.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  You're just talking semantics.  Save you a day of stress.  Leave.  Again, until, you know, my boss is, which technically you guys are not, tells me to leave.  I can't.  I know Z-Rock's not here today.  Did he quit?  No, Z-Rock.  Damn it!  He decided to be sick today.  Yeah, you know what?  He was setting up today's sick day.  He is, he is, I know, I know because we've all been working together for what?  This, this staff of a good seven years now, right? 
[01:06:00]  Just about.  So, we know each other's like quirks and foibles.  And, and E-Rocks, certainly I got mine.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be the first to admit.  But E-Rocks is so obvious when, eating, eating, and he likes to set up his sick days.  He really does.  I'm in the bathroom and all of a sudden he's in front of the mirror with his mouth wide open.  So, obviously as I'm leaving the bathroom, I gotta go, E-Rocks, what's that about?  You know what I mean? 
[01:06:30]  Absolutely.  Every time I, because it's not like he has his mouth a little bit and maybe he's just checking  out his face or whatever.  His mouth is wide open.  Like, someone noticed me.  So, I'm like, all right.  E-Rocks, what's up?  Oh, I don't know, man.  I have my throat.  I have my, I, it's a little sore.  So, I'm looking, who looks at their throat when it's sore?  Every time I went in.  But he wanted to make me know that there's something going on with his throat because  he wanted to take today off.  Every time I went in there yesterday into his little production room, he had his head  in his hands.  Right.  I go, E-Rocks, what are you doing? 
[01:07:00]  I don't know, man.  Just woke up.  I'm not feeling good.  He's tweeting about wrestling the night before.  Oh, I know.  But when people are sick, they're just sick and all of a sudden we'll come in here and  go, hey, where's, where's, I don't know, where's Travis?  Oh, he's sick today.  And you don't even think twice about it.  Right.  But E-Rocks sets up his sick days.  That's fucking twisted.  He also double-checked with Roland to find out if we had any guests coming in today.  Oh, really?  Before maybe someone he would like to meet.  That's exactly right. 
[01:07:30]  But what is that about?  Is that some psychological shit?  I think it is.  Yeah, and he thinks he's slick.  Is he paranoid that we're all going to be onto him, that he's taking another fake sick  day?  He thinks he's slick.  He's not, though.  He loves to think he's slick.  He's not.  He really does think he's pretty cool.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Wouldn't you love to play poker against a guy like E-Rocks?  Oh, so easy to just, no poker face whatsoever.  Because I rolled my eyes even.  Because there he is.  I'm like, oh, oh, E-Rocks. 
[01:08:00]  What's, why are you looking at your throat?  Oh, he's trying so hard to just, yeah, look, I could set it up.  Right.  And not thinking that you would say he's setting up a sick day.  Here's what he pictures.  He really wants us to buy that he's coming down with something.  Here's what he pictures.  He pictures Opie going today, going like, you know, yesterday he did say, like, how dumb  would you have to fucking be?  You know, wait a minute.  This does make sense.  He's out today.  Yesterday he was saying. 
[01:08:30]  Must be the throat thing.  Yeah, the throat thing.  That would all make sense.  But it's so obvious.  We go the other way with it.  And we know he's setting up fake sick days.  Just take your fake sick day.  And it's also that, like, if I called out sick or if Sam called out sick or even if Danny  called out sick, no one would think twice.  Right.  Because we never do.  Right.  Yeah.  But Eric always makes a big production.  The production.  Yeah.  The setup.  The fucking, the preface.  And the beauty is he'll be back tomorrow.  Yeah.  Like, when I'm sick, I'm out. 
[01:09:00]  I got a block of days I got to take.  Yeah.  Because I'm sick.  No one's sick for 24 hours.  If you're sick for 24 hours, you never take the day.  He'll be the same old rock tomorrow.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'll be totally fine.  We all know he's a lying sack of shit.  Yeah, he's probably going to Conan O'Brien taping today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Or he thinks he's going.  He's got something going on today.  Yeah.  Whatever.  We all take fake sick days.  Don't set it up.  It's embarrassing for everybody.  Especially for, like, us. 
[01:09:30]  Like, it's one thing that, like, you're not supposed to convince me and Travis and you  guys.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Like, we're cool.  Like, we're cool.  Yeah, it's not.  You don't have to sell us on it, dummy.  Yeah.  We're the cool ones.  It's the other guys.  Yeah.  Let the record state, I really, really do like the staff we have these days.  But if all you guys were gone one day, I don't care.  We could do this.  Yeah.  It's your names on the wall.  If it was just me and Ant and no help behind the scenes, it would suck after a while. 
[01:10:00]  But if all you guys took a day, same day, who cares?  You know what Iraq needs to do is walk past the boss's office with a handheld mirror and  a tongue depressor.  And then he could just like, ah, ah, and glance over, make sure they're looking.  And then the next day when he takes off, they go, you know, he was looking at his throat  with a tongue depressor and a mirror right in front of my office yesterday.  He does it in the public bathroom.  Yeah.  This bathroom here is, hate to use the old analogy, Grand Central Station. 
[01:10:30]  A lot of people come and go in all the time.  Like, if I want to check out some dumb thing on my face, I'm not going to do it in that  bathroom and I'll find a mirror somewhere else.  If I'm going to try to jerk off, it's not in that bathroom.  A lot of people coming through there.  On his mouth wide open in front of the mirror, I'm like, oh, Jesus, Iraq, what?  Oh, I don't know.  My throat.  My throat is...  And there was nothing specific.  It was just, oh, my throat.  My throat.  Take a day off tomorrow.  I mean, my throat.  I suck at this.  Oh, no.  Something with my throat. 
[01:11:00]  Something with my throat.  Are you noticing I'm saying this?  Too much food goes down it.  I don't know.  Oh, we got Iraq on the line.  Ah!  Damn it.  Iraq.  Yeah.  I don't appreciate you guys talking about me when, like, I'm really sick.  It's not a bad Iraq.  That sounds pretty good.  I like this.  I like fake Iraq.  You heard the coughing, though.  Yeah.  It's like watching the bosses go to the bathroom so he can run out of his office and chase them  in so they'll see him in there checking his throat.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God.  A lot of people saying Iraq is a hypochondriac.  No, this guy called him a hypochondriac.  Hypochondriac.  Is he?  Oh.  Hypochondriac.  You know, the hypochondriac.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I fucked up your joke because the cursor was over the one P.  Ah.  That's funny.  James, that's funny.  I'm sorry.  I fucked up your line.  Hypochondriac.  That's really funny.  Sorry about that, man.  I should have went to your call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poor Iraq.  Iraq called him fat.  Yeah.  That's what Kevin's saying.  He's not a hypochondriac. 
[01:12:00]  He's lazy.  Yeah.  It's different.  Where's Troy?  True.  I want Troy's take on this.  Troy, a guy that hasn't slept in a week, never takes a day off.  He never takes a day, man.  He can easily.  He's in here all the time.  Sam's running again.  Although I haven't seen him in quite a while.  Troy?  Yeah.  Where does he hang out in this building?  Troy, I love you on the radio.  He's in production.  He's in that little studio all the time.  I hear you on the after show with Sam, and I'm like, why don't we have Troy on our show  more?  What's your take on Iraq?  Yesterday, because I know you were in production, so you might not have heard what we were talking 
[01:12:30]  about.  No, I heard everything.  Yeah.  Oh, you heard.  He sets up his own fake sick days, right?  He does that all the time.  Okay.  Yeah.  He just sees the most unslick person.  Just does.  He thinks he's so clever at things.  Yeah.  And it's just the worst.  And you just look at him like, really, dude?  Like, you think we're that stupid to buy this?  But I'm trying.  My New Year's resolution this year is to try to ease up on the Iraq busting.  I've heard you trash him hard on the after show.  I've told Troy that if I can get him on mic, it takes me three questions to get to where 
[01:13:00]  he's really at.  Within three questions.  Because he comes in, and he's like, ah, you know, he's doing his thing.  Right.  But within three questions.  Did you see Iraq do the throat thing yesterday to set up this?  No, but he was out at, like, right after our meeting.  I mean, he was gone.  How did he feel?  How did he look in the meeting?  Perfect.  Yeah, he was fine.  He was totally fine.  He was goofing around, having fun.  He was laughing with us at all the jokes and stuff.  So why did he leave right after the meeting?  It must have been the throat thing.  Ah, the throat thing.  Did he tell anyone?  Oh, shit. 
[01:13:30]  He was out early on Monday, too.  What?  Ah, shit.  He left really early on Monday.  I think he was out, like, 1130 on Monday.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  So he's got something going on.  He's probably just living it up in that mansion of his.  Ah, that's true.  He's got the Nagel mansion.  Castle Nagel.  Yeah, he's setting it up.  Yes.  He's getting it together.  Is he?  Troy's not happy that Iraq has real space now.  He's got a mansion.  Probably filling the moat.  Oh, true, true.  Well, summer's coming.  You don't think Iraq deserves a nice house in the suburbs at this point?  Well, he works hard.  You know?  He works hard.  You just said he was out, like, noon. 
[01:14:00]  Well, I mean, when he is here, he's working hard.  Do you think Iraq's going to be having, like, summer parties and things at the house?  He is saying he's going to have a housewarming party.  Yeah, he will.  Wow.  Yeah, he'll have a lot of people, too.  Iraq.  I've got a room.  Troy, when was the last time you slept?  I slept well last night, but I was up all night Monday into Tuesday.  Right.  So then I'll do that again.  I don't DJ until Saturday, so I'm okay.  You don't take fake sick days?  Occasionally, I do.  How's your throat?  My throat's fine. 
[01:14:30]  I'm taking a couple days off at the end of the month.  I have surgery coming up.  Uh-oh.  I broke my nose pretty bad about 10 years ago, and I can't breathe out of this nostril.  And I'm getting rhinoplasty surgery.  He's getting a nose job.  Oh, man.  He's getting a nose job.  Are you going to have a different nose?  I'm going to get this bump because of the break.  So you want a different nose.  No, no.  I just want this bump smoothed out.  Oh, so you're making believe it's because you can't breathe.  I can't.  Listen.  Listen.  This is the nostril.  This is this one.  I can't breathe out of this one.  I could do that, too.  Yeah, that's sounding all right. 
[01:15:00]  Sounding better, actually.  Sounds like he's setting up his, uh...  Yeah, setting up the nose job.  This is a cosmetic procedure.  Setting up the nose job.  You want a nose job.  No, no.  I just want this bump removed, and I want my septum fist.  I don't see no bump.  There's a bump.  You know how into aesthetics he is.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  You know, I broke my nose pretty bad, so I just wanted to get it fixed.  How'd you break it?  Uh, a fight.  Ah.  Fight, fight.  Yeah.  Oh.  Someone almost took the nose off your face, huh?  Well, it was definitely my fault.  This guy I was in a band with, we would go on tour, and I took care of this kid. 
[01:15:30]  I made sure he had a hotel room.  Like, when we would tour, if you had money, you would get a hotel room.  If you didn't, you had to sleep in the van.  So, there were places out in the Midwest in the winter where it was fucking freezing cold.  And I would tell this kid, like, come stay in my hotel room.  I'd buy him food.  And then when I...  And when you touched him, he hit you.  He hit, yeah.  All right.  Sounds like...  Oh.  Sorry.  And then, um, I had, when I left the band, this kid talked a lot of shit.  So, I found him at Dave & Buster's in Philadelphia. 
[01:16:00]  Dave & Buster's in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, I was just, I was fucking with him.  I said I was going to kick his ass.  And then, um, I started, uh, kissing him on his lips.  And telling him I'm going to fuck him.  And, uh...  Like in jail?  All right.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Uh, it was just, it was just like, I was, I was fucking crazy, dude.  I was just crazy.  So, uh, so I went to kiss him again on his lips.  And he went, poof, busted me right in my nose.  And just split my nose.  He headbutted you?  Yeah.  Well, he should have.  Yeah, exactly.  I deserved it.  So, it just split my nose open so bad. 
[01:16:30]  And then I just, I smoked a blunt and took a lot of Percocets.  And I didn't have insurance, so...  You never got it fixed?  No.  Wow.  This was about 10 years ago.  Damn.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  But I'll be out sick then.  Wow.  At the end of the month, so...  Yeah.  How's your throat?  Throat's fine.  Okay.  As long as the throat's okay.  Yeah.  You think E-Rock's really sick today?  Right?  Of course not.  Do you think...  Of course.  Of course.  Because he asked Roland if we had any guests coming in.  Uh, do you think that Roland's answer would have dictated how bad his throat was today? 
[01:17:00]  Well, of course.  Oh.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Well, because he wants his autographs and he wants his pictures.  Oh.  That's all he really cares about.  So...  You mean working here?  Yeah.  That's like his entire reason for working here is autographs and...  That's...  Movie memorabilia signs.  Well, of course.  And he's been told multiple times, you know, don't get so many autographs, ease up on that.  And he just, he completely disregards it.  How many autographs did he get?  I heard it.  I've heard.  Because Jimmy's bad. 
[01:17:30]  I've heard...  Jimmy will get a bunch of autographs.  Is E-Rock worse?  Yeah.  Really?  I think...  In E-Rock's mind, I think he is Jim.  So, Jim is entitled to do stuff like that because he's talent.  Yeah, of course.  He can do whatever he wants, you know?  Well, all you guys are entitled to a point.  To a point.  But then when you have a display outside here of like 10 different photographs and he wants  an autograph for everybody he knows.  Yeah, it really is.  It's just like nobody even asks.  Right.  It's just...  Eric got four things autographed by Edge yesterday.  Four? 
[01:18:00]  Four.  And that's good.  And that's, yeah, that's on good behavior.  What a fucking...  Four things?  Four.  Is that below average?  Four, though?  Yeah, it's below his average, yeah.  Ah.  Eight or nine is usually the...  Especially for a wrestler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The word queer is coming in a lot, Troy.  Why is that?  Because of the story you just told.  Which one?  The fucking...  Yeah.  The story, very homoerotic.  They're insane.  Yeah.  But, I mean, when you're fighting somebody, the thing you want to do is, you know, just  be a fucking asshole and... 
[01:18:30]  Disrespect them.  Disrespect them, yeah.  So, I mean, that's a good way to disrespect somebody.  And I deserved what I got, so I'm paying the price now.  Oh, E-Rock likes getting things signed.  Loves it.  Is addicted.  It's his most favorite thing ever.  Yeah, it really is.  Well, food.  He wants...  Second.  If he can put the two together.  Yeah.  He once had a conversation with me.  If the edge could sign a piece of cake, he'd...  It would be a perfect scenario for his mind.  He would just lose his mind.  He once had a legit conversation with me about how much better hanging up signed pictures 
[01:19:00]  was than any form of art.  Ah.  Really?  Yep.  I can't wait to see Castle Nagel, how it's decorated.  Well, downstairs, he's going to have an elliptical machine.  Oh, really?  Did you play this on the after show?  No.  Instead of getting a...  Because he canceled his gym membership because he realized, you know, it's useless.  He's not going to go.  But he bought exercise equipment for the house. 
[01:19:30]  He's getting an elliptical and weights and, like...  So, it'll be a coat rack.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I mean, I was talking to Jess about this, and I said, so in his house, he's going to have  an elliptical machine and gym equipment as well as a couch and a television.  What do you think he's going to go for?  Yeah, where do you think he's going to be?  You know what?  And I've noticed over the years, unless you have somebody that's going to motivate you,  you're not going to do it. 
[01:20:00]  No.  It's the discipline that it takes.  It's so far beyond EROC.  His wife has been telling him to be a lot more active.  Oh, I did hear that on the shit show, I believe.  She's fed up with him.  Yeah.  I think it's after show, but she's fed up with him.  It's what they're calling it, after show.  Fed up is a good thing to pay.  It's appropriate.  He's just fed.  Because he's fed.  Just checked my Twitter.  Vince A writes, thanks for trying to fire Sam today.  Best thing you guys have ever done.  Well, again, I mean...  We try to fire him. 
[01:20:30]  He's not listening, though, Troy.  Yeah, well, I'm sure he wants employment, so...  Well, I told him they don't...  They can't.  Right.  But we can.  If you want me fired...  Leave.  You don't...  I mean, you can't.  Leave.  If you want me fired...  Leave.  You are welcome to go to management...  Leave.  ...and put that request in, but...  Do you want him fired, or is it okay if he just moves to a different department?  No, I want him to suffer.  That's fine.  I mean, again, if that's something you want...  Leave.  ...you would have to have a conversation with management.  Freddie writes, how did we go from firing Sam to busting Iraq on a day off? 
[01:21:00]  Because Iraq sets up his own fucking...  We've had this conversation.  Set up a sick day.  Stop.  Just take your stupid sick day.  Yeah.  No one questions him.  No one cares.  He gets so paranoid, so he sets up his fake sick days.  Or just be honest and be like, you know what?  I'm taking the day off.  No, because then they'll have a problem with that.  But be honest to the people that he works with.  Yeah, just email.  No, just don't fucking put it on display for everyone.  I'm not feeling well.  I'm taking a sick day.  See you tomorrow.  Don't be standing in front of the mirror with your mouth wide open, waiting for someone 
[01:21:30]  to notice, so then they have to go, oh, Iraq, I noticed your mouth's wide open.  Walking around with a thermometer in his mouth.  Just checking my temperature.  I think it's up.  With that old school fucking ice bag on his head.  Sometime in the six hours between live tweeting Monday Night Raw and coming to work, his throat  went to shit.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  He's got too many fucking plates spinning.  Yeah.  They're all full, too.  Right.  That's the problem.  He spins full plates.  Oh, E-Rock.  We love the guy. 
[01:22:00]  But we love him.  Anything else, Troy?  No.  Everything's good.  You're really good on the after show.  Thanks.  Have fun.  Sam does a great job on the after show.  Ah.  Fired.  Not according to Troy.  Well, I'm not the boss.  So we...  Yeah, really.  Oh, this is where this all began.  Sam talked to Dr. Ruth.  Were we supposed to talk to Dr. Ruth?  That's true.  No, I think she was in later or something.  Yeah, she was an afternoon thing.  Yeah.  We used to have her on the show all the time.  She was great.  When she was, you know, kind of relevant.  You think she's 83? 
[01:22:30]  She's 83.  Would you have sex with Dr. Ruth?  Oh, God, no.  So I...  Yes!  For the story...  Dr. Ruth, yes!  Look, there reaches a point where for the story doesn't cover it anymore.  But it's Dr. Ruth, the sex expert.  You think she...  What the...  83!  You think she ever was good in bed?  Maybe back in the old days when she was a little fucking spinner.  Can we see a young picture of Dr. Ruth?  There's probably not one.  There's probably sketches.  Paintings.  But it's worth playing.  Sam talked to... 
[01:23:00]  That pussy's probably like beef jerky.  Talked to Dr. Ruth about a couple of the new things.  The kids are doing these days.  And she had no idea.  Really?  She's supposed to be this big sex expert.  Sex expert.  Out of touch.  She is a little out of...  Not anymore.  She's not updating her knowledge.  It's computer sex.  There's a young Dr. Ruth.  She was always old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is there any young pictures?  What's the one on the left?  Is that her?  In black and white?  I would love to click something.  Why can't it click? 
[01:23:30]  Because his computer's a piece of shit.  I don't know why it's still here.  And we've said that a million times.  That's right.  And they're not going to replace that either.  What does Baldy say about the computer?  It's been replaced.  I think the issue here is that every computer in this building is like 10 years old.  Yeah.  They so don't care about this place anymore.  What are they doing?  A Bain Capital thing here?  Just stripping it down?  Yeah.  And then sell this thing?  I think so.  They just strip it down, sell all the shit off, auction it off. 
[01:24:00]  Because you're serious?  The computers are 10 years old around here?  Well, yeah.  Look at them.  I mean, all of these computers run on what?  Like Windows XP?  And they're all these old Dell machines, you know?  There are some good computers around here, but they're very old.  Is this 1996?  I didn't even click this picture.  Oh, God.  What is that?  That's horrific.  Who's that dude?  I don't know.  Dr. Ruth Parker.  From Emory.  Emory College. 
[01:24:30]  Emory University.  Dr. Ruth.  Is that her on the right?  Where?  No way.  No, it's Dr. Ruth.  I think old pictures of her.  She's like with Hitler or something.  Yeah.  She's just always been old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's not a young picture of Dr. Ruth online.  So, look.  Even that.  That picture's got to be 30 to 40 years old.  And it looks like how she looks today.  Yep.  Why is she an expert on that shit?  She's no fucking expert. 
[01:25:00]  Who the fuck banged her?  No expert.  Oh, my God.  I ain't buying it.  Oh, my God.  Is she short?  Is that tiny?  Yeah, I know.  We remember.  She's way under five foot.  Yeah.  She is definitely a little troll midget.  All right.  We're babbling.  We'll come back.  We'll get some Dr. Ruth on the air.  Ah.  Sam asked her two really good questions.  Yeah.  And also, I don't know if it worked yesterday, so we'll have to decide.  But I guess they cleaned up the Wee's Vietnam tapes.  The Nam.  Even more.  In country. 
[01:25:30]  That's up to you.  If you thought they were working at it, we'll do a little more.  Yeah, I kind of like that.  It's a great little insight.  All right.  Cool.  So, and other things.  Stay there.  Are you looking for some hard, hot action?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have a big one, Heather.  Oh, let me swallow that fucking dick down my throat.  I'm going to put it in you.  Oh, yeah.  And just give it to you until you're dead.  Are you looking to get turned on like a light bulb?  Oh, my pussy is so wet.  It's dripping now.  I want you to be so wet that it looks like a lake down there. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  The Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium will connect you one-on-one for a private party  with the man himself.  I'm going to spank you, madam.  You've been very bad.  You killed an old lady with a hammer, and I'm going to spank you.  Spank it hard?  It's the wildest all-live action with one hot, developmentally disabled entrepreneur  with a mustache.  I'm going to lick the little man of a boat until my tongue is chapped and dry and smelt. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my crystal's swollen.  I'm going to come see him.  That's right, madam.  I'm going to make you come so hard that people are like, hey, there's a Niagara Falls  and that lady's underpants.  You're in for one meaty overtone.  I want to make him on your face.  I want you to come so hard that your cancer will fall off.  Rub it.  Oh, my God.  Rub it quicker.  Rub it so fast that people think it's life.  Just sit back, relax, and whip it out. 
[01:27:00]  Until you're coming like nobody's business.  It's the Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium.  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah,  It's Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And I'm very happy because I get a chance to interview Lady Gaga.  Thank you for joining us on the program, Lady Gaga.  I would like to ask you my first question.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show would really like to have sex with you. 
[01:27:30]  Would you fuck him or would you allow him to fuck you?  Yes.  Now, there's a big rumor that we need to dispel.  Do you have a big clit?  Yes.  Do you love getting fucked in the ass?  Yes, of course.  Oh, Lady Gaga, they're telling me you have to go.  Is that true?  No.  All right, just a few more questions since this interview is very interesting and compelling. 
[01:28:00]  Are you a size queen?  Yes.  Do you like shit play?  Yes, of course.  Does fecal matter?  Well, thank you for your time, Lady Gaga.  This has been a very informative interview, unlike the one you did with Larry King.  This is Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show saying goodbye.  Goodbye.  I'm going to reach my telephone.  I'm going to reach my telephone.  We're sorry. 
[01:28:30]  The number you have reached is not in service at this time.  Please check the number or try your call again.  Serious, serious accents.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do this.  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  Oh, I thought we were doing an E-Rock thing.  Oh, we are?  Oh, we are?  This is an E-Rock thing. 
[01:29:00]  Well, this is Aerosmith, right?  Aerosmith.  Let's see.  No.  Getting topical.  I don't have the sweeper in front of me.  I don't see that.  What's the name of this song?  Well, the name of the song is Sick as a Dog.  Oh.  Oh, is this for E-Rock?  Oh, see.  It sure is.  Is it because E-Rock is sick as a dog?  Oh, I get it.  Can we get E-Rock on the phone?  We've been trying nonstop. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, he will not.  Someone's having trouble answering their phone.  But doesn't he understand it's good for the radio show?  I don't give a fuck if we wake him up.  It's good for the show.  He's sick.  He's sick.  I don't care if he hates it.  Why else is he here?  He's here for us to make fun of.  God damn it.  The poor guy's sick.  Come on now.  Let's leave him alone.  Oh, guys.  Oh, by the way, the Christians are mad at us, too.  What happened?  They don't want us to talk about religion because it's proven that there is a God and all that. 
[01:30:00]  And we should shut the fuck up.  Even though what?  I feel we're just kind of making light of it and having some fun with it and making some jokes.  How was it proven?  What happened there?  I don't know.  The guy didn't give me the proof.  He just said it's proven, though.  Oh.  I think some of our observations on religion are kind of just fun.  Yeah.  That's all.  Because it's the great mystery.  Right.  And then we kind of hash it out and goof on a little bit.  Yeah.  I think we have a good time with the whole damn thing.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Nah.  Why does God have to be so serious? 
[01:30:30]  God's very serious.  You can't mess around with God.  God is so serious.  He doesn't have a sense of humor.  He can't use his name in vain.  No.  Why is that?  No.  Because he's very serious.  But he could just strike you down for using his name.  That's why.  You want to stay under God's radar.  You do?  Yeah.  You don't really want to be on his radar.  Why is he such an asshole, then?  Oh, gee.  See what you're doing there?  Why is he an asshole?  You're blipping on the radar.  I love the guy, but why? 
[01:31:00]  Why all the rules?  So many rules.  Why?  So many rules to adhere to.  See, this is what we do.  You tell us you don't want us to talk about religion.  Then we'll just talk about it.  It's called the Dave Douglas philosophy.  Right.  Whatever Dave Douglas told us not to talk about, we marched down that hall and talked about it.  Just talk about it.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not making fun of anyone's religion.  I really am not.  I just have questions about the mysteries of the universe and God himself. 
[01:31:30]  Great mysteries.  Amazing mysteries.  Oh.  And they don't like when we talk about science.  Me in particular.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I'm a goofball about it.  Because I'm a goofball about it.  We were doing that whole ant thing.  Yes.  Oh, right, right.  The ants.  Yes.  And I thought we had a good observation.  If we were built like an ant, we could literally jump out of this building every day and land on the sidewalk.  And just land on the sidewalk and walk away.  That's a great discussion. 
[01:32:00]  Who wouldn't want that?  Ants fall off of tables.  And to them, it's like falling out of an airliner.  Right.  And then they're fine.  I think that's just an amazing thing.  That should be discussed.  Or you could hit an ant hole with a fucking hose.  Yep.  Which would be a tsunami.  Right.  With hurricane force winds.  Right.  And then they kind of just walk out of it.  Do you remember as a kid when you did try to drown ants?  They float.  They float.  They're amazing animals.  Thank you. 
[01:32:30]  I've never seen an ant go underwater.  No, they can't.  What is that about?  Surface tension holds them there.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  So you could, if you were built like an ant, you would never drown.  And you could jump out of buildings and land on the sidewalk.  If they weren't so tiny, they would be superheroes.  Be amazing.  Yeah.  Ants would just be amazing things.  And they look cool as all hell.  They look like fucking, like robots.  They do.  Like fucking cyborgs. 
[01:33:00]  Fucking love ants.  I know.  God, I'm obsessed with them now.  Well, why can't we figure out how to make ourselves more ant-like?  Because, again, it goes back to religion.  Because, you know, the great creator kind of fucked with us.  Made us all mushy and stupid.  Yeah.  Why would he make us mushy?  Well, mushy.  We can't do anything without hurting ourselves.  You fucking slip on the ice.  Ow!  There goes your elbow, your hip, your fucking...  You think an ant has ever slipped on the ice?  Oh, ants slip on the ice.  They don't care. 
[01:33:30]  You think an ant ever woke up and went, ah, I slept on my neck.  No.  Ah, I slept wrong.  My thorax.  Why are we so sensitive?  Human beings are so sensitive.  Sensitive.  Stupid.  You think a lion...  You think a lion even...  No, fuck the ant.  You think a lion fucking is like, oh, my leg.  No.  I bruised you yesterday.  He's walking around with a hyena bite taken out of him.  Yeah.  He's fine with it.  Yeah, they don't...  We stink.  They don't bitch to other lions.  Horrid design.  Humans aren't that impressive. 
[01:34:00]  No.  They can't do anything.  We're just, oh, but well, we got the superior minds.  Great.  I've never seen an animal with a cold.  Yeah, right.  Some pet owners would argue that fact with me, but I've never seen an actual cold on  an animal.  I'm sorry.  They just don't look miserable sick.  I've never seen an animal look at his throat in the mirror in the bathroom.  They don't get to take sick days.  They take off from hunting the next day.  Like E-Rock.  Like E-Rock.  You think a lion takes a fake sick day ever?  It doesn't even take a real sick day. 
[01:34:30]  Because guess what?  One sick day and that's its life.  Right?  It gets killed.  Because they can never show weakness.  No.  He loses the pride.  He loses a...  So a lion could have the flu in the woods, I was going to say.  In the woods.  In the woods.  In the woods.  Woods is.  But they can't allow anyone to know it has the flu.  No.  You lose your alpha male status.  God, humans suck.  We really do suck.  The worst design ever. 
[01:35:00]  Why do bees suck?  What's wrong with you, JG?  Bees.  They got stingers.  Fucking bees rule.  These are cool.  But that's weird, though.  You got that one...  You get that one chance.  Yeah.  In most cases.  You use that stinger.  That's it.  Oh, yeah.  With those bees where it pulls the stinger out.  Little fucking honeybees.  What are they?  Yellow jackets.  And with my attitude, I would have used my stinger a long time ago.  Oh, yeah.  You'd be fucking dead in a second.  It would still be kind of figured out.  You know what?  I'm like, ah, I'm trying to...  Look, I got a stinger.  Don't make me use this thing. 
[01:35:30]  We're both going to regret it.  How long ago would I use my stinger?  Oh, gee.  Day one of us together.  You'd just break out of the hive and just stabbing somebody with the stinger?  I'm a bit uptight.  I'm a bit uptight and ornery at times.  Yeah, a stinger on me wouldn't be good.  No fucking way.  I don't know how you hold back from not using your stinger every fucking day.  That is a fucked up design, though, that that bee has where in order to sting someone, 
[01:36:00]  you're dead.  It's like having a gun that shoots in both directions.  You're just like, ah, I got to shoot this guy.  But do you realize how pissed off you have to be as a bee?  You're like, you know what?  Because somewhere in that dumb bee brain, you know what's going to happen.  You think, yeah.  You have to know.  You've seen it happen to your fellow bees.  So something has to soak in somewhere.  We decided yesterday a cat-sized ant could really fuck you up.  Oh, yeah, easily.  What size would a bee have to be to beat humans? 
[01:36:30]  At that size, they fuck you up.  I know.  Well, they make you miserable.  With a giant, you know, swarm.  I'm not talking a swarm.  I'm talking one-on-one fighting here.  One-on-one brawl.  How big would the bee have to be?  Oh, I got it.  I'm looking at it.  A water bottle.  Wow, fuck.  That would, first of all, that would scare the living shit out of me.  Of course it would.  A water bottle-sized bee flying at your face.  Even when you see one of those giant bumblebees, it scares the fuck out of you, right?  Yes. 
[01:37:00]  So imagine they're as big as the water bottle.  Yeah, bee wins.  So then the stinger would be, you know, like half a pen.  Oh, man, that would be bad.  You're right.  Imagine a whole bunch of those coming at you.  Water bottle-sized.  And we decided cricket, you know, even the size of a human cricket, it would look pretty fucked up.  You would scream in horror seeing a human-sized cricket coming towards you.  You can handle crickets.  But you could kick its ass.  They are mushy.  I think one punch.  Any creature that gives its position away at night is just stupid. 
[01:37:30]  So I think you could take crickets no matter what.  Yeah, crickets.  No matter what size.  Although, again, the nightmares you would have for years to follow, a giant human-sized cricket.  Oh, my God.  In order to even fight it, it would be crazy.  What about a beetle?  Beetles are very tough, very hard-shelled.  Well, they would look kind of like mini-tanks, right?  Yeah.  But what would they do to you?  But what would they do to you?  Nah, you could handle them.  I don't know. 
[01:38:00]  I don't think I could handle them.  I would just knock it out.  I don't think I could handle a bee.  Yeah.  Cockroach.  They just look creepy.  But you could handle them.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of another bug that would be that.  What about a caterpillar?  Caterpillar?  As big as the hallway.  Yeah, that would have to be as long as the hallway.  That would just be creepy.  You're stabbing that shit and just green goo is just pouring out everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  You could take a caterpillar, though. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, you could kick a caterpillar's ass.  I don't care how big it is.  They're very mushy.  Yeah, I think it's more about that.  Oh, they got that thing that they go, and they eat the leaves.  Yeah.  They make those little fucking tracks through the leaves.  That could fuck you up.  Yeah, it could.  That could fuck you up.  Just stay behind it.  Oh, fucking scorpion?  Don't get in front of a caterpillar.  A scorpion doesn't have to be any bigger than a scorpion.  A scorpion.  Right.  Yeah.  No, for a fist fight, though, wow. 
[01:39:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  I got one.  Thank you to JD, a regular, on the instant feedback from New York City.  Yeah.  Mosquitoes.  Oh, man.  The giant mosquito.  A mosquito the size of...  Not even big mosquitoes freak you out when you see them land, but...  Oh, with those hanging legs?  Oh, and the legs are swinging?  Oh, I hate that.  Why can't a mosquito control its own legs?  That's fucking horrifying to see.  And you know he's just waiting to fuck it until you fall asleep. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  It's like you can't fall asleep.  You can't take your guard down at all.  How big would a mosquito be?  Have to be.  I think, again, the water bottle rule applies here.  Fuck yeah.  You've got a water bottle-sized mosquito...  You'd be out of your mind.  ...coming at you.  Wow, that would be scary, man.  Look up the tarantula wasp.  Please.  See, now you're talking things that are scary at their own size now.  Yeah, of course.  Fuck.  Oh, shit. 
[01:40:00]  That thing is huge.  What is this thing now?  Oh, man.  Stop it.  See, so they do have giant bugs.  I can't believe that.  That thing's giant.  That has to be from Africa, right?  Yeah, I hear they've got giant bugs in the rainforest and stuff.  Africa's got some fucked up shit.  Why are their bugs so big?  There's so many whys.  Big bugs.  Look at the size of that thing.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  It's as big as your hand, like, just its body, and then its legs spread out bigger.  I don't know.  I've got the heebie-jeebies now.  Praying mantis?  Praying mantis would be scary, man. 
[01:40:30]  And I think, because they could stand up like that, and they got them hands that look like  they're jabbing, I think a praying mantis would kick your ass.  And then in their arms, they're like a nutcracker.  I think praying mantis are from the kangaroo family.  Kangaroo?  Yeah, when they stand up straight, there's not much difference.  It is weird.  Because the kangaroo has those dumb little arms, too.  And they got those dumb little arms that kind of hang there.  Like the praying mantis, just like, eh.  Fucking praying mantis could take you out.  Man, yeah, look at that. 
[01:41:00]  And he flies.  He could pick you up, fly, and just drop you from great height.  If one was as big as that doorway, would you be freaked out?  Oh, man!  Fuck that!  Oh!  Yeah, I'd be pretty freaked out.  This is the dumbest conversation ever.  But nightmares.  What about spiders?  Yeah, yeah.  Spider wouldn't have to be that big, either.  How big?  I'd say a spider the size of that chair.  Oh, that's big, though.  Yeah.  I'm thinking the size of a bulldog. 
[01:41:30]  You think a bulldog-sized spider would kick your ass?  Fuck yeah.  You could kick it, though.  Still?  Yeah.  Think about kicking it.  You run up to a spider and kick him?  Mm-hmm.  And just let him fucking fly?  Yeah.  I think you could beat a spider.  He's the size of that chair, though.  You're going to be a little leery walking up to him.  Throw all those legs.  Travis, if I were to try to kick a bulldog-sized spider, I would be scared that it would try  to attach itself onto my leg.  Yeah.  That's true, too.  Imagine all his legs wrap around your foot, and then you just scream.  Too many legs to deal with. 
[01:42:00]  Now you're screaming in horror.  You've got to step on his little spider toes and hope that hurts him.  I would think you'd kick him in his spider face, which is in the front of his little  spider body, but you've got to kick him in his spider face.  Well, good luck with that, because those legs wrap around you, then...  Then you're done.  It's impossible.  You're done.  But I think in a chair, like a reclining chair-sized spider, you're done.  Just fucking...  They own the earth.  Let me see.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  You know what?  No.  No.  No.  Go ahead, Kyle.  Just because this has come up a lot.  Go ahead, Kyle.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  I'm a really big fan of you guys, and I'm also a big fan of Corolla, and a couple of weeks  weeks ago, Jimmy was on Corolla's podcast, and a discussion came up about how you had  said you had the run-in with Corolla when you went to visit them on Lovelight.  Do you recall that? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Corolla came out and said, well, it wasn't a big deal.  He...  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  This is what I'll say.  Jimmy came back with some info saying that Adam Corolla says he didn't blow me off the  time I went to L.A., and me and Bob Eatman, our agent, same agent as either one or both  of those guys at the time.  We stopped by the studios, and I got the big blow-off from Adam Corolla.  The only thing he said to me was, what are you doing here?  And he walked down. 
[01:43:30]  I think he was having a cigarette or something.  Then I had an amazing...  Not an amazing, but a lovely conversation with Dr. Drew.  He was very, very cool to me.  And I've told the story a couple of times on the air, and Adam Corolla's saying he didn't  blow me off.  So maybe me and Adam Corolla need to talk.  Yeah.  How's that?  Because I feel like he...  He's a pretty good guy.  I mean, you should follow the podcast for a couple of minutes.  All right.  Well, he's a pretty good guy.  All right.  Get the word out to Adam Corolla.  Let's have a conversation, because I really felt like he...  Oh, God.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:44:00]  He's talking.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Maybe me and Adam need to talk, because I certainly remember it one way.  Maybe he was in a bad mood that day.  Maybe he didn't realize that it looked like a blow.  I don't know.  When it's just once, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  I think we did all the bugs, though.  Yeah.  Well, you did all the scary ones.  What?  Yeah?  There's one.  The fly.  All right.  Now, a fly.  Wow.  When they bite, they're fucking annoying.  Whoa.  What about those ones on the beach? 
[01:44:30]  Those big fucking flies?  The green ones?  When you're sitting there, and all of a sudden you go, ow!  Yeah, the green ones, right?  What are they doing?  They don't have, like, teeth.  What is that?  But then why the fuck?  They don't have stingers.  They don't really have teeth.  It's the worst itch ever.  Why?  It hurts.  It's like you got hit with a needle, but I don't know what it is.  I don't get that bug itch.  Because, like you said, I'd rather get bit by a dog than a fly.  Right?  I know.  Because at least when a dog is like, oh, that fucking hurts.  But you don't got that annoying, like, deep itch that you can never satisfy. 
[01:45:00]  Like the mosquito itch?  Mosquitoes itch.  I'd rather be scratched by a fucking cat.  And it leaves a big fucking bump.  Oh, my.  What is that?  Well, mosquitoes, they not only suck your blood out.  Is it a poison or something?  They have two things in their nose.  Right.  In their little proboscis.  One sucks the blood out.  Right.  Another one injects this shit into you that thins the blood so they could suck it up because  human blood's too thick.  Right.  So it thins the blood out so they could slurp it up easier.  But it also, we're allergic to it, so it also makes a big bump on you and fucking fucks 
[01:45:30]  you up.  How did they figure that?  How did the universe figure that shit out?  I don't know.  I don't know, but it's fucked.  God, I wish I had some answers.  I don't know what the fly does, though, that makes that stinging pain when you're laying  on the beach in that green fucking shit fly.  Right.  You know those green shit flies that fly around the shit?  I don't know what color they are in your neck of the woods, but I believe on Long Island  they're green.  It's that weird.  And sometimes they're that dark black, too. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  And when they bite, what the fuck is that about?  They hurt.  I don't like them at all.  No.  Like I said.  Horse flies.  Yeah.  Horse flies.  I'll say it again.  I'd rather be bit by a dog.  No joke.  I would say a fucking horse fly the size of a tissue box.  Really?  And you're done.  Oh, my God.  Think of how much it hurts now with them that size.  Oh, my God.  Imagine the fuck it.  They would suck out a part of your muscle.  Oh, my God.  I think that's what they're doing, too.  They're, like, putting that flat little sucky nose mouth thing on you and going, like, 
[01:46:30]  and, like, and that's what hurts.  They would suck out, like, a segment of your flesh.  It's like the old school booster shots when you were a kid.  Yeah.  Every time a fly bites you.  Oh, do I hate the fly?  Is there anything worse when you find a nice spot, whether it's on a beach, on vacation,  maybe in a park?  You're like, oh, this is fucking perfect.  Relaxing.  I got my girl.  I got maybe a little food. 
[01:47:00]  I don't know.  Whatever.  And then also the flies.  Flies come around.  And they just, flies are the most annoying thing, I think, on Earth.  Yeah.  I don't think there's more, I don't think there's anything more annoying than flies when you get  in that situation where you can't even control the situation.  You know what the problem is with flies?  Flies have memories.  They have a good memory as to whatever it's really called.  I don't know.  But location-wise, if they know, if they have something they like, sugar, shit, whatever  the fuck it is, they know where it is and they remember where it is. 
[01:47:30]  So they'll fly away if you shoo them away, but then they can come right back because  they can sense where it is.  They know.  They have a fucking memory.  That sucks.  How many times has your day been wasted because you're like, okay, I'm swatting over here,  swatting over here, swatting my legs.  That's terrible.  And then you try to cover up your legs, but they'll find that one piece of skin on your  neck that is still exposed.  Fucking annoying.  And it's not even the bites.  It's just them landing drives you nuts.  You get the hee-jee-jee-vies.  You know what else is that you described that perfect scene of hanging out and, you 
[01:48:00]  know, it's a nice park, beach, whatever.  Blacks.  And then the-  Yeah, well, that too.  That huge cloud of gnats that just hover over your head and then come around.  It's like, what?  Why?  I don't know.  Gnats.  I don't know, man.  They travel in giant clouds and they're not everywhere.  They're just in a big cloud.  Right.  And then they just descend on you and you're in a big cloud of gnats. 
[01:48:30]  That was the worst part of Little League.  Nats on the field.  In the outfield.  Yeah.  And you had to raise your glove up because you were told that, you know, they would go  to the highest.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So there would just be nine kids on the field with their gloves in the air.  With their glove in the air.  Trying to get gnats away from the faces.  Gnats.  And they're just annoying.  They don't really hurt you.  No, they're very annoying.  But they're just all over the place.  What's the most annoying thing, you think?  Besides stupid human beings and dumb management like we have. 
[01:49:00]  But flies are...  I'd say flies...  Mosquitoes are very annoying.  Mosquitoes not so much because they don't just keep coming at you like flies do.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're easier to kill than mosquitoes.  Or what bothers me about mosquitoes is how stealth they are.  Yeah, yeah.  Because all of a sudden you're like, how the fuck did it just get my ankle?  How did he get me?  How the fuck did it come out of nowhere and get my ankle?  And how did I not feel him getting it?  Right.  I think that's part of it too.  They give it a little anesthesia to you so when they poke you, you don't feel that.  How about this?  Being able to land on something without them knowing it? 
[01:49:30]  Without them even knowing.  How cool is that?  Very stealthy.  Yeah.  They're so light they land on you and you have no fucking idea.  You don't even know.  You don't feel it.  That would be awesome to have.  All you got to do is trip one little hair on your arm and you're given away.  Right.  But they don't even do that.  No.  They can just fucking land there and just get you.  It's nice.  You know what insect, very annoying in the summer, is the ordinary bee because you try  to shoo them away and then they come right at your face and just hover right in your eyes  and you keep going back and they keep coming forward at you. 
[01:50:00]  That's more than annoying though.  That's just fear.  Yeah.  It's utter fear.  Bees can put fear in you.  You do just those wacky things like Regan says when you walk into a spider web and you  do that whole thing.  But beers, uh, beers.  Beers, yeah.  Bees put fear in you, man.  Beers scare the shit out of you.  Fuck yeah.  There's one more ant.  We're trying to move on but this guy is just screaming on instant feedback from Buffalo.  Jeff writes, ticks! 
[01:50:30]  Fucking ticks!  Oh, man.  How big would a tick have to be?  A tick has to be no bigger than your iPad.  That's big.  And, yeah, but, but that's like deadly right there.  I think, I think.  He can suck your blood.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm looking at an old school mouse because most people don't have these  fuck, you know what?  Wired mouse.  You know what?  For the first time in years I've realized that we're using old school mouses.  Wait, I gotta clean the ball out from underneath it.  Let me pop the ball out.  You guys are right.  Our equipment is really fucking old. 
[01:51:00]  But this old school mouse, imagine a tick this big.  A tick that big.  Just like stuck on you.  Fuck!  All right, that's horror.  That's horrifying.  How much blood do you think a tick the size of a mouse could get out of you?  If you're sleeping and you don't know that he attached onto you, you wake up in the morning  with this just big bag of blood hanging from you.  Well, it starts out this big.  Yeah, yeah.  So when it's done, it's the size of a basketball.  When it gets engorged, it goes from the size of a mouse to the size of a basketball.  And that's all your blood in there. 
[01:51:30]  That would freak you out.  You pull him off real fast and you leave a fucking softball-sized head under your skin  to get infected.  You have to take it out with what?  Like a fucking ice cream scoop.  Oh, with a fucking gun.  Yeah.  No, I think a tick.  How about a tick the size of a garbage pail?  Jesus.  That would kill you instantly.  Because all he'd have to do is attach onto you for a second.  Yeah.  And he would suck enough blood out of you for you to collapse.  You'd be done.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Damn.  Thank God none of this will ever happen.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't be alarmed, people.  We're just speculating on these battles.  No one has come up with something more annoying than the fly.  Than the ordinary house fly.  Yeah.  There's no bug more annoying.  And then you add those green flies at the beach or the park.  And that's the most annoying thing you could go through.  Not destructive, not painful, not hurtful, not anything.  Just annoying.  Completely annoying.  Just being annoying.  And fucking frustrating.  Because you want to kill every fly within a mile radius of where you're sitting. 
[01:52:30]  And you could barely get one done.  Yeah.  Every once in a while you get one, sure.  So fucking annoying.  Damn.  All right.  I like delving into the impossible.  It's called pot talk, sir.  Yeah.  Oh, I commented on this last night on Twitter.  Have you seen the commercial for those Indians that are trying to lend money?  No.  $5,000? 
[01:53:00]  No.  First of all, it's one of the most racially insensitive commercials I've ever seen.  Is it a new one?  It's put on by Indians.  Yeah.  They're going to lend you $5,000.  Right.  And it starts, you hear, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  You hear like tom-tom drums.  And then there's one with a guy.  That's very racist, by the way, isn't it?  It is, because it's kind of like old school.  Although Indians did fucking use the tom-tom drums.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like an old school tom-tom thing.  You could probably pop the commercial up if you find, I think it's called Something Sky. 
[01:53:30]  Something Sky, what's it called?  I'm getting a question as they find that.  Do ants sleep?  Do insects sleep?  No, that's the problem, too.  I don't think they ever sleep.  Western Sky.  Thank you.  They might sleep for five minutes, maybe.  Yeah, they don't need sleep.  No.  They're amazing things.  Why do humans need sleep?  Why?  Why couldn't we figure that shit out?  Why?  Yeah, why?  But why didn't we need to rest?  Yeah, why do we need to sleep so much?  Whoever created us, God, why did he decide we need to fucking waste a third of our life? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Why?  Thanks for that, by the way.  I paint my fucking ass.  But why?  We'd get so much more done if we never slept.  We really would.  I've never seen this commercial.  It's called Western Sky.  Yeah, yeah.  Get the Western Sky commercial up.  Western Sky can put up to $5,000.  Yeah.  And you're checking it down to buy tomorrow.  Yes, the money's expensive, but it's a lot cheaper than a payday advance.  And it's enough to really get you over the hump.  So get off the payday treadmill and call 866-SKY-1224-NOW.  This is loan sharking. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Now, let me tell you what that fine print said.  Yeah.  It costs 116% interest.  Of course.  You can tell.  $5,000.  Once you pay it off, it costs...  It's over $10,000.  It's over $40,000.  Wait, wait.  You said $100 and...  $100 and...  It's 84 payments of $460 or something like that.  It's...  But you said 116%.  116%.  Yeah, 116%, but the way it's compounded. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, okay.  I got you.  It turns out to be...  Yeah.  Over $40,000.  For a $5,000 loan?  For a $5,000 loan.  84 payments of $468.  Wait, so 80...  84 payments of $468.  Hope he's doing some manual, old school multiplication mathematics, which we really don't see that often. 
[01:55:30]  I'm going to go 64 over there.  A lot of people pull the iPhone out.  I'm going to go 54 there.  Calculator.  32, 37.  Some other way.  I'm going to go 2, 11, 9, 13, 9, 3.  39,312.  40 Gs.  Did someone else get that on a calculator?  39,312.  $39,000 to pay back a $5,000 loan.  A $5,000 loan.  How is this legal?  How is it legal?  What's... 
[01:56:00]  Where do you see this?  It's on TV.  I see it all the time.  Now, you know how we joke about YouTube videos, like all the assholes that have to dislike videos?  This is a video you should be disliking, but look at all the likes.  Look at all the likes.  Look at all the people that are like, yeah, I would pay $39,000 for a $5,000 loan.  I think they're liking because they want to fuck the Indian brought on here.  Oh, really?  But it's so taking advantage of...  It's Indian on Indian crime, I believe.  I think they're trying to get to these...  If you need $5,000 that bad, you certainly are not going to be able to pay off $40,000. 
[01:56:30]  Go to a loan shark.  Yeah.  This is...  I think you'd be better off.  Yeah, it's worse than loan sharking.  With the threat of having a broken leg.  Yeah.  It's worse than loan sharking.  There's one with a girl, one with a guy, but I've seen this one, and I thought...  I had to freeze the picture because I had to look at the fine print because I was like,  I did not just see that.  But yeah.  And you see the fine print says what you said, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yep.  That is... 
[01:57:00]  But you don't...  Where did you see this?  On TV.  Yeah, I see the commercials all the time.  Just regular TV?  Yeah, like Discovery Channel and things like that, History Channel.  Oh, wow.  Any...  Fuck, let's get in that business.  I know, right?  Who needs $5,000?  I'll give it to you today.  Yeah.  But you're going to fucking pay.  But look, if they're asking for $39,000, I'm going to give you $5,000.  You give me $20,000 back.  You're way ahead of the game.  You're ahead of the game.  You're right.  Right.  That's their lowest APR, too. 
[01:57:30]  If you want a $2,600 loan, you're going to pay 139%.  And if you want a $1,500 loan...  I just need $1,500.  234%.  234%.  And their website says that they reserve the right to change the rates in loan products  listed below without notice.  Oh, my gosh.  It's now 1,000,000%.  Right.  1,000,000%.  Who the fuck does this?  Compounded hourly.  Who the fuck would do this?  Criminals.  I beg you.  Is there one person that did this out there? 
[01:58:00]  I need to talk to you.  Yeah, who actually did it?  Don't fucking fake it.  I don't need the fake shit today.  Who took the loan out?  I don't need the fake shit any day, actually.  Come on.  Yeah.  How...  Most annoying bug is the flea.  Oh, the flea.  Fuck.  Fleas are bad, man.  Those jumping motherfuckers.  They don't have to be any bigger.  No.  Flea...  Oh, man.  I told...  If you look closely...  Imagine a bunch of giant fleas bouncing after you.  If you look closely at my arms, which you've never done, which is...  Oh.  ...which I understand.  I'll do what's called the summer shave down every year, and I'll shave the hairy arms down. 
[01:58:30]  Not fucking skin, but just down like you.  Look, you don't get a lot.  Sure, sure.  I'm wispy.  So I clean it up a little bit, right?  But when I do, and then I get tanned arms, I got so many fucking scars on my arms from  flea bites.  Ugh.  Because I had a cat that was infested, and I told a story when I was living in Buffalo.  It infested me, my apartment.  It drove me to the point where I almost killed myself.  You go insane, yeah.  I was out of my mind.  I couldn't keep up with the fleas. 
[01:59:00]  Every time...  And every time a flea bites you, it's two weeks of itching.  Ugh.  Not just one day.  I don't know what it is, but it drives you insane.  And just when you think everything's clearing up, then another one hits you.  Yeah.  And you can't fucking...  Even if you...  I bombed my apartment at the time with the dumb bombs, and I couldn't afford an actual exterminator.  I couldn't...  I never officially got rid of them when I was there.  Yeah, I went through that.  I tried everything.  So you know the deal.  Yeah, went through the same thing.  The flea bite is brutal.  Where you're wearing white socks, and you walk around the house, and they're just all over 
[01:59:30]  your fucking socks, and you realize how many are actually in the rug.  Right.  Everywhere.  Right.  Ugh.  And they just jump.  I mean, they're impossible to control.  Fleas.  Wow.  Fleas the size of tennis balls.  Oh, right.  Just bouncing.  Just bouncing.  And they can jump like fucking...  They would be jumping the height of like fucking 10-story buildings.  I must say, we're extremely clever.  Oh.  Because we're picking the exact object that these things should be. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  That would be horrible.  Or they would just be the biggest pain in the ass.  Just...  All bouncing at you.  Yeah.  You go into your apartment, and all you see is hundreds of tennis balls, but they're actually  ticks.  Fleas like super balls.  Just bouncing real high.  Ugh.  Chasing you.  This conversation, if we were high, would be the most amazing thing ever.  Hope people are smoking weed out there.  Could you imagine 10 small fleas bouncing?  Oh, that would be fucking frightening.  Coming at you like a wave. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  Wow.  That could be the best one yet.  That's a bad one.  We got a guy that took out the loan.  Oh, shit.  Cool.  Joe in Oceanside.  Please, Joe, don't tell me you're making this up.  No, no.  I'm being serious.  For real.  Like, you know, I got into a little bit of some shit.  I needed some money here and there.  Okay.  I had a checking account.  That's all you need.  So, I called up.  I didn't really, you know, realize how ridiculous the percentage was.  It was, like, 287%.  So, like, every $100, you owed them $9 a week. 
[02:01:00]  So, I think I got, like, $600 and I had to give them back, like, $1,000 in two weeks.  So, yeah, but you don't have to pay them back.  So, I just never did.  And they send you emails.  They send you all this nonsense.  But they're on an Indian reservation.  So, United States law doesn't go over them.  Why?  So, and they probably.  They can't prosecute you.  Hold on.  Now this gets really interesting and I'll tell you why. 
[02:01:30]  They probably know that as well.  And they probably figure, look, we'll get something for our $5,000.  We'll get easily $5,000 back.  We'll probably get $6,000 or $7,000, $8,000 back before these guys realize they can't keep up anymore and then they bail.  As long as they get back more than they gave.  Which they obviously do.  Which they're going to.  I think they're also focusing on the Indian community.  Like, people that are on reservations.  So, they could use some kind of Indian reservation law to bring these people to justice if they don't pay. 
[02:02:00]  Very interesting that they're on a reservation, though.  You speak them with forked tongue, white man.  Because what happens is you.  You said you were going to pay back.  You can't keep up anymore.  So, you just go, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'm just not sending them money anymore.  But at that point, they've already made their cash.  Well, I didn't pay them back a penny.  Not a dime.  They send you final notice smoke signals?  This is your final notice.  They take a gamble.  Yeah.  They take a gamble to see if they can get the money back.  And if they can't, then there's nothing they can do. 
[02:02:30]  They have no jurisdiction at all.  So, why don't we all get a nice $5,000 from them and never pay them back?  And we'll shut them down.  If everybody knew that it was that easy.  Right.  All right.  Here's some info for you.  Don't do it again.  Thanks, Joe.  Bye.  Oceanside checking in.  Bugs are annoying until you get an electric fly swatter.  Then it becomes a game.  Everybody likes those things.  You're always fascinated as a kid watching these bugs fly into that electric grid. 
[02:03:00]  He's saying it's the actual fly swatter.  Oh, the swatter.  Yeah, I've seen that.  I haven't seen those yet.  Yeah.  I'm a city dweller.  I don't have this fun stuff.  Electric.  It's electric.  I don't have any of this shit.  My house was infested with fleas because my asshole neighbor doesn't take care of his cats.  Dude, you know what?  I have to adjust.  Fleas, the most annoying thing.  Way more annoying than when flies are doing their thing. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  I mean, when you're infested with fleas.  Because there's no getting away from it.  You're in your house.  This is you almost insane.  I'm telling you.  Jonathan.  There's not a million flies in your house is what it is.  Oh, man.  Don't you feel so satisfied when you smash that fucking fly that's been annoying you in the house?  Of course.  You're like, yes, victory.  But fleas, you're not going to get them all.  And they're tiny, too.  You don't even see them.  Yeah.  Jonathan, go ahead, buddy.  Good morning, boys.  Amen.  Claire.  Since November, my house has had fleas in it. 
[02:04:00]  I have no pets, no cats, no nothing.  My fucking neighbor, his cat, got into my crawl space and they don't treat it.  We went away on vacation.  We come home to fucking like 50 fleas in my house and my crawl space, according to our pest control guy.  So infested, he couldn't even fucking go in there.  Worse.  Make matters worse.  My neighbor now doesn't talk to me like I'm the asshole.  No apology, no nothing.  Right.  Yeah, of course not.  Why would they?  Just a shitty situation, dude. 
[02:04:30]  Do you get bit by him?  Yeah.  The worst.  My wife's pregnant, so the guy fucking doesn't want to spray too many pesticides.  But we've had six fucking treatments so far.  Oh, boy.  What a nightmare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It fucking blows.  Getting bit.  And like you said, you got to wear white socks to find them and shit.  And you'll find them all on the fucking couch.  And honestly, I feel like a scumbag.  I feel like I'm fucking dirty, you know?  I had my apartment in Buffalo.  I had it bombed twice.  And then there was, I'm trying to remember, because this goes way back, but I had a portable one. 
[02:05:00]  One of those portable bomb things.  Yeah.  So it was kind of like spray, which I just kept on my coffee table.  And then I would just spray my couch almost, I'm going to exaggerate a little bit, but  on a regular basis, certainly, to give me a clean spot on my couch where I know I could  chill and watch some TV.  Because I just couldn't keep up with it.  Yeah.  We can't use the bomb because she's pregnant.  They have to use other chemicals.  The bomb is no good, according to our pest control guy. 
[02:05:30]  Would you allow a flea to bite your tongue?  Oh, fuck.  I don't even want them in my fucking house.  I don't know.  Just for the conversation.  All right.  Thank you, Jonathan.  Bye for the fuck now.  Take care.  How does the laser kill a spider?  Red laser kills spider.  This must have been one of the lasers.  Our old intern, Evan, makes these lasers.  They're so much more powerful than a laser pointer.  Yeah?  Like, uh...  Oh, so they do throw off some heat?  A lot, yeah.  Like, he burned one of Ryan and Fez's intern's shirts with it. 
[02:06:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's Evan?  Evan, uh, he was on the after show on Friday.  He was in Paul's class.  He pissed his pants to prove that he didn't piss his pants.  Oh, I remember him.  Yeah.  God, how do you remember these guys?  Whenever they do something stupid, he's swivel hips.  Remember swivel hips, Evan?  I remember swivel hips, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  He's hilarious.  He's doing well.  He now makes lasers?  He's not doing well.  He makes lasers.  He's not doing well.  Like, he's smart enough to make lasers, but he's not smart enough to apply any of those skills  to anything useful.  How do you make a laser? 
[02:06:30]  Do you know how to make a laser?  A laser.  Well, uh, what do you need?  A ruby rod.  You need a bright light source and, uh, some, uh, mirrors.  He took his laser.  Some prisms.  And he burned a hole in a CD spindle in like 10 seconds.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  Wow.  I, I, I, wow.  I think he said like a laser pointer is five milliwatts.  Right.  Yeah.  And this laser he made is 1600 milliwatts.  Oh man.  I didn't even know you could do that.  Oh, this guy killed a spider with a fucking laser. 
[02:07:00]  With a laser.  Yeah.  Spider's like, what?  But you gotta get it right on.  Like, you gotta be around when there's lasers?  Yeah, of course.  Poor spider's like, fuck.  Been around millions of years now.  Yeah, now who?  That dumb one has to live in the world of lasers.  Space age thing's gotta nail me.  Right.  All right.  We're, uh, we're gonna break, uh, do the Dr. Ruth thing.  Ah, Dr. Ruth.  Sam taught Dr. Ruth a couple things.  That's right.  I'm pretty amazed by this, actually.  I can't wait to play the audio.  And then maybe some Weez tapes today from Vietnam from 45 years ago.  Yeah.  Oh.  And, uh, whatever else is in the news. 
[02:07:30]  We haven't even talked, uh, about Peyton Manning.  Oh, right.  Yes, yes, yes.  We'll talk about him a bit next.  I don't know.  And now, here's 32 seconds, quote, unquote, with Ving Rhames, quote, unquote, talking about  the hood, quote, unquote.  I grew up, quote, unquote, under hood rules.  I grew up on 126th Street in Harlem.  You feel me?  There's a hood rule that you don't, quote, unquote, snitch on me.  That's a hood rule.  You see what I'm saying?  Now, that's different than, quote, unquote, mainstream America rules. 
[02:08:00]  You see what I'm saying?  But in mainstream America, that's hood rules.  You see?  And so, um, uh, one, people don't understand, quote, unquote, street codes and hood rules.  You see what I'm saying?  Uh, I'll put it this way.  Only the hood, quote, unquote, can police the hood, period, quote, unquote, period.  You see?  Where's Egypt?  Egypt is in Africa.  That was 32 seconds of, quote, unquote, Ving Rhames talking about the hood, quote, unquote,  the end, quote, unquote.  And I'll leave it at that, quote, unquote.  So, you're starting a family, and you've got a million questions, as any new parent would. 
[02:08:30]  Thanks to the Nicey Nice Network, you'll get the answers you need.  All right, let's not play the modern-day father, okay?  Andrew Dice Clay will set you straight on how to allocate all of those pesky parenting responsibilities.  You stay right there.  When the kid is born, let her do, meaning your wife, what she's supposed to do.  You know what I mean?  You can stand there and watch and applaud and go, you're doing a very good job.  They do the diapering. 
[02:09:00]  They're, like, numb to that shit.  Occasionally, there will be those pesky late-night inconveniences.  A mother knows how to shut them up.  A father does not.  But that's not your problem.  When the baby cries in the middle of the night, I make it simple.  You turn on your side, two feet against her.  You start edging her towards the bed.  She'll know it's not the edge anymore when she goes over.  And she gets up, and she'll go, what the fuck?  And you say one word.  Don't make it a conversation.  Diaper.  And that's it.  Eventually, your partner will need a break.  But be sure to keep her on a short leash. 
[02:09:30]  Babies could sense when the father is watching her.  Because if you don't, well, just listen to Dice.  Because when she goes, I just want to go to the gym and work out.  And then you'll get the call.  You know what?  I ran into Sarah.  She wants to get a little lunch.  Is that a...  And what are you going to do?  You go, all right, honey, go ahead.  Next thing you know, Sarah wants to have dinner with her.  We're having a glass of wine at some fucking shit bar.  Next thing you know, it's one in the morning.  You're ripping the hair out of your fucking head.  And here comes this fucking sloppy, drunk fucking animal. 
[02:10:00]  And she's going, what's the matter?  I take care of the baby every day.  You can't watch the baby for a few hours.  And you said, you said you're going to the fucking gym.  That's what you fucking told me.  You understand that?  And you leave me here.  You know I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Baby's crying since you walked out of the fucking door.  Next thing you know, you're paying a half for what you got.  Preenup or not, they get fucking paid the minute babies start flying out of there.  Parenting Tips with Andrew Dice Clay. 
[02:10:30]  I know what I'm good at.  I know what I'm not good at.  Now available from the Nicey Nice Network.  Your job is to go, and you leave.  We're going to try to move on, but we want to talk about kittens and cats for a second.  Because, I don't know, during that long break, we've been watching cute kitten videos on YouTube.  All of them, multi-million view videos. 
[02:11:00]  Kittens and the Internet.  You think we'll ever get sick of cats and kittens on the Internet?  No.  I say no.  It's got to be the number one thing.  Maybe, you know, porno I know is huge.  And then cats.  And then kittens and cats.  Kittens probably is the second most popular thing to look at on the Internet.  Yeah.  I would bet money on that.  Cute Munchkin Baby Kitten Talks Too Much is the title of that one.  And is he just meowing?  Yeah.  Just meowing.  He's just making little...  Oh! 
[02:11:30]  Oh, no!  1.1 million views.  This guy.  Cute Munchkin Baby Kitten Talks Too Much.  Anyone listening to this show right now that has cats, their cats are going absolutely bullshit  right now.  I know.  But I want to make a quick point, though, Ant.  I've known my whole life that I'm really allergic to cats.  Bad.  Like, really bad.  I can't even, like, pet a cat without just sneezing and breaking out and all that. 
[02:12:00]  It's horrible, right?  But kittens are so fucking adorable when they're, you know, just tiny little kittens.  Yeah.  That I get tricked every time and go, ah, that allergy thing.  Ah, bring them home.  And I always bring them into the house.  Yeah.  Not in the last...  I've been cat-free for at least seven, eight years now, thank God.  I finally learned my lesson.  But it's always because they look so fucking adorable.  I forget about the allergy.  Cutest things ever.  But I will say it again.  I don't care how cute your fucking cat is or your kitten is. 
[02:12:30]  They're all evil monsters.  Yes, yes.  Cats are assholes, period.  They are.  That's the headline.  Cats are assholes.  And Sam told a quick story during the break when I said that.  Well, Bruiser Brody.  Bruiser Brody.  How long have you had this cat?  We've had Bruiser for three years.  Maybe more than three years.  Long enough to know the situation.  We brought him when he was a kitten from a shelter.  You saved his life.  We brought him in.  You didn't think that would sink into his dumb cat brain.  No.  Because he just attacks, like, randomly as, like, a goof. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  Like, that's what he does.  So, two nights ago, Jess was asleep on the couch.  And she had her arm over her head.  And Bruiser was just sitting on the ottoman.  And he was just watching her and watching her and watching her for, like, seven minutes.  Just sitting there.  Patient.  And then all of a sudden, she's not moving because she's asleep.  He just jumps up.  Sticks his nails out.  Grabs her as hard as he can by the arm.  Chomps into her. 
[02:13:30]  And runs away.  Like, ah, look what I did.  And she just wakes up like, what the fuck just happened?  That's a horrible way to wake up, man.  And she just sits up and starts pointing at the cat.  And she goes, you're a fucking asshole.  You're an asshole.  Every cat's an asshole.  She's so pissed.  It doesn't matter.  None of this shit sinks in.  That's the person feeding me and taking care of me.  No.  They feel entitled to that.  They're lunatics.  They're crazy.  And you can tell the way, like, they treat you when you're asleep or the way, like, if 
[02:14:00]  you're just laying there, they'll kind of jump up on you and kind of nuzzle you a little  bit.  That if you were unconscious for more than 36 hours, I would say, and they hadn't been  fed, they would start eating you within 36 hours.  Yeah, they'd just start eating you.  Yes.  Abso-fucking-little.  There have been cases, by the way.  Just start taking a little bite here.  A little nibble.  But, like, a dog will die of starvation next to you.  Nope.  Not all.  You don't think so.  I love those stories.  There's one every once in a while. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where the old lady died, and that faithful fucking dog of hers was like, well, no one  else is going to feed me anytime soon.  And they find the woman, the old lady, with, you know, some significant chunks out of her.  I do think.  There was one in Huntington Station, I believe, or Huntington, the last one we talked about.  I think cats would do it sooner than dogs, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'd eat you.  The dog would look around the house a lot and go, fuck, there really isn't anything else  in this house.  Nothing to eat.  Eh, well. 
[02:15:00]  Except my dead owner.  Fuck.  Three or four days for a dog, maybe, but a cat wouldn't go more than 36 hours.  No, cats are assholes.  I mean, the phones are lit.  We don't have to do this today, because we've done it before, but everyone has a cat story  about, you know, a cat they've had in their lives for a really long time, and the cat just  doesn't realize that.  Yeah.  And will attack you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I'll tell you, I said it to Ant, the coolest cat I ever saw was Ant's old cat.  He had a cat named JD.  Oh, yeah, that was a cool cat.  I remember when he was yesterday.  This fucking cat of yours was not a cat. 
[02:15:30]  It felt more like a dog.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a cool dog, too.  Yeah, it was just a very, very cool cat.  It used to fetch.  It would jump up on, like, you could tap yourself on the shoulder, and the cat would just, whoop,  jump right up on your shoulder.  Right.  It was more loving.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Than a cat I've ever seen.  Had a good personality.  Bruiser Brody used to sleep in the bedroom on the pillow above Jess's head.  Uh-oh.  Right.  And then around six o'clock in the morning, every morning, he would decide it was time  for breakfast.  So he'd just grab her skull. 
[02:16:00]  Just put his paws around her skull until she woke up.  People can't be woken up like that without having some ill effect.  No.  No, she said-  You don't want your skull grabbed to wake up.  No, no.  Every morning, you're going to have a psychological breakdown.  Yeah.  They're fucking psychotic.  Yeah.  Just grabs her skull.  Time to wake up.  Time to eat.  I'll never have a cat.  I'll never have a cat again.  No, I'm done.  I'm done with fucking cats.  I would love to have a dog eventually, but I have to get those hypo-halogenic ones. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, no.  What, like hairless?  Not hairless, man.  They figured out that, you know.  No, man.  There's some cool-looking ones.  The dogs, they have hair instead of fur.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  So they don't shed.  That's right.  Oh.  Like those weird-looking ones.  For the most part, they've been made in a lab, so you know what the fuck are in their  brains.  That's going to come out to haunt you someday.  They're idiots, too.  Look at that video that you're watching there.  6.8 million views.  Yeah.  Views. 
[02:17:00]  It's, there's not one cat video that has under a million.  6.7 million for a little kitten so tired.  Just a tired little kitten.  Little kitten so tired, and it's sitting there with his eyes half-masked, and he's rocking  back and forth, and it is adorable.  The video, funny cats.  Funny cats.  67 million views.  67 million views.  This is a whole culture.  Everyone breathed funny cats. 
[02:17:30]  They're all challenging each other to have the ultimate cat video, too.  It's a big deal.  And it is funny.  I mean, I can see why someone would watch this 67 million times.  67.  Oh.  That's fake.  Oh, it's a whole, like, montage of, uh...  No, just wait.  Okay.  Sorry.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Cat comes out.  Oh, there's sound effects to it.  Great.  She's walking on a...  That's a funny... 
[02:18:00]  That fell on a montage.  It's a montage of funny cats.  See?  Oh, look at that.  This is way too visual, unfortunately.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  The sound effects are making me so mad.  Yeah, it's like...  Because you don't really need the sound effects.  But who are we to say?  It has 67 million views.  They did something right.  We're idiots.  At least they picked a good song.  Yeah, we picked a good song.  Put it up on our Facebook page. 
[02:18:30]  Opie and Anthony, please.  Oh, yeah.  Might as well.  Since Eric's out fake sick, I'll take it.  Yeah.  I'm going to congratulate Jimmy for keeping his silence for Rush Limbaugh.  He's doing the silence for Rush thing.  Yeah.  He's not speaking for the entire show.  I respect Jimmy for that.  He's nodding, by the way.  In protest.  That was a thank you, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't like what's going on with Rush, and I applaud him. 
[02:19:00]  You think he'll make it to the end of the show?  Yeah, he'll probably do a chip thing.  Oh, he almost did that.  Hey, I said we wouldn't take cat stories today, but I can't help myself.  There's one that I have to take.  Oh, sure.  Is it okay?  Oh, please.  Bald Mike, go ahead.  Hey, this is Bald Mike.  How you guys doing?  All right, buddy.  My ex had this Himalayan cat, so she had him before me.  And it would give me dirty looks all the time.  And I tried.  I tried to be nice to it.  And then it scratched up my bed, so I had it declawed. 
[02:19:30]  So it would lay there with its bandages on his paws.  Like, it couldn't even move.  We had to give it food and water.  It wouldn't move.  I came home from work and jumped on my bed, and there's a pile of cat shit on my side of the bed.  So this thing couldn't move, but it jumped up shit and jumped off.  It just hated me.  Yeah, it hates you.  They'll tell you.  They have no problem telling you they hate your guts, even though you feed them for seven years.  The cat always wakes up.  Bruiser wakes Jess up, so she feeds him.  Right.  Like, six o'clock in the morning, and then she's up. 
[02:20:00]  And by seven o'clock, he walks back into the bedroom, jumps up on the bed, and goes to sleep next to me until I wake up.  And you can't even...  It just lets me sleep.  Really?  I don't see.  And you can't even teach her a lesson, by the way.  No.  Leave it outside for a few days in the middle of winter.  It'll come back and still have the same fucking attitude.  Yeah.  How bad do you want to get rid of that cat?  I love the cat.  She wants to get rid of it.  Badly, right?  Yeah.  I say no way.  When we got Jack-Jack from Steve from Bayshore, we actually wound up getting two cats that day, completely against my opinion and better judgment. 
[02:20:30]  At the time.  Yeah, at the time.  But the second cat, the first day at the house, jumped up my side of the bed and pissed all over the bed.  And I was like, all right, take it easy.  You do not live here now.  You're going away.  And the cat was given away that day.  Was it still alive?  I have no idea.  I could give a shit.  Did you give it back to the shelter? 
[02:21:00]  No, it was from Steve from Bayshore.  So, Stephen had to take it back?  No, I think Melinda found somebody for the cat.  But it's just I could not fucking deal.  I'm like, no, I don't care.  You cut your losses.  I don't care about training it.  I don't care about anything else.  Done.  I got some video of Bruiser Brody when he was a kitten.  Oh, yeah?  I got put on YouTube and get a million hits.  You really should.  Let's try this.  Look at it, 38.4 million hits. 
[02:21:30]  It's a kitten in a little cabinet.  Look at it, it's a little kitten.  It's called IRQ Kitten.  It's, look, it's...  The title doesn't even make sense, and it does 38.  You know what?  I'm going to put the word kitten in every one of my videos.  Ah, good idea.  I'm just going to put kitten.  It's the same kitten, just in the little...  Look, it's in a little mug, and...  It's in a coffee pot.  Stop it.  Put scalding coffee in there.  I like our coffee.  The whole I like our thing is...  I guess it's probably an older video. 
[02:22:00]  It's a kitten thing.  Hey, Travis, what do you know about this Peyton Manning?  Can he even play football anymore?  He's a quarterback.  The Colts decide to release him because they don't want to pay him, what, a big bonus,  28 million or something?  Well, they're going to give him his 28 million.  So why are they releasing him, then?  Because they're going to draft Andrew Luck.  But why not keep him on the team if they're paying him?  I don't think he wants to be on the team.  I heard they were getting rid of him because they didn't want to pay him all that money.  I could have said I read that they're going to pay him the 28 million. 
[02:22:30]  I could be wrong.  I think you might be.  I could be.  It's happened before.  You probably are.  I think you are.  Let's just say he is.  Because I think he even would want to stay with the team if they're paying him just because...  No, he wants to be a starter somewhere.  But how is he going to be a starter?  They don't even know if he could throw properly yet.  Well, exactly.  He'd rather leave and sign with another team that might make him the starter.  This is a big deal, Ant.  Oh, I know.  No, this is a big deal for...  Where do you want Peyton Manning to go, Ant?  I have no idea.  They're not paying him.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're not paying him.  There's no way.  Because he would probably take that deal. 
[02:23:00]  Because there's no guarantee the guy could even play.  Yeah, nobody knows if he can even throw the ball.  People have said that they saw him at the Super Bowl.  And when they would say hi to him, instead of just turning his neck, he would have to turn, you know...  Oh, his whole body?  His body.  So, like, if you can't move your neck, how are you going to, you know, look quickly and, you know, scan the field?  Oh, man.  That would be awkward.  Just your shoulders going around like, oh, oh.  You go left, right.  I got to see where's the receiver.  Oh, my God.  And he's going to attempt to play in the NFL next year. 
[02:23:30]  Someone will sign him.  I see.  He might have to do some tryouts, though.  It's going to be the Dolphins.  Just for the name.  I say Dolphins.  Guaranteed.  Yes.  They're on the list.  It's not the Jets.  No.  Jets won't take him.  Anyone who thinks the Jets will take him.  The Jets would take him cheap.  But I don't think Peyton's going for cheap.  So, I think it's...  I'm almost positive it's the Dolphins.  Yeah, you don't think the Jets even have a...  No, because, like Travis said, he wants to be a starter.  He wants to be a starter.  And he wants to win another ring because, you know, his brother there has two. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So, he wants to...  You know, he's a competitive guy.  He doesn't want to be, you know...  The one ring brother.  The one ring brother.  No, that's terrible.  I think everyone wants him to go to the Jets because it's the best storyline.  Yes, for the story.  But I don't think he would.  I don't think he wants to, you know...  New York's a very, you know, media-driven town.  If he's bad in Miami and he's bad in New York, it's 20 times worse.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  If it's in New York.  He doesn't want to share the town with Eli.  He's got to pick a team that has a chance to win in the Super Bowl immediately.  Well, any team that's got a chance to win in the Super Bowl immediately doesn't need him.  Yeah, I know.  That's why it's a weird fucking story.  He'll go to an average team.  Why would he continue playing if you've got this fucked-up neck and you've got all the money in the world and you're 36 years old and go to the Super Bowl?  Why do any of these guys keep playing?  They have to keep playing.  What else are they going to do?  You've got a Super Bowl under your belt and, you know, absolutely going to be in the Hall of Fame, all that shit.  Why didn't Brett Favre retire, you know, four years, you know, when he should have? 
[02:25:00]  True.  There's something in these people that they just have to play football.  Old tiny dick, Brett?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, remember that tiny thing?  I forgot about that.  He's a little dick.  All right, there you go.  We did the Peyton Manning story for everybody.  That's some sports for you.  That was good.  That is good.  You don't need an hour.  No.  Sports Talk will do an hour.  Get the highlights.  Maybe two hours on that.  What do you think?  With all these dumb scenarios that never happen.  That's a four-hour show today.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When that hit last night, nobody's got to do prep if you're in sports. 
[02:25:30]  Nope.  Just let's talk about Peyton Manning.  Where's Peyton Manning going to go?  I love the impossible scenarios on Sports Talk.  Yeah.  Joe Namath in his prime, or?  Peyton Manning with a bad neck.  What do you do as the GM?  Well, you got to go with Joe Namath.  I think Joe Willey's the guy you got to go with in this one, Broadway Joe.  Trying to think about the scenarios.  Yeah, the scenarios are great.  Horrible.  Oh, Muhammad Ali, when he first just started shaking, you'd think if Babe Ruth was playing 
[02:26:00]  today that he could hit Tim Wakefield's knuckleball in his prime when Tim Wakefield had a good  knuckleball.  Well, obviously, the Bambino never had to put up with that kind of pitch.  It's going to be very difficult for him.  And this is the type of year when they do that, because there's nothing going on.  There's nothing really going on.  Oh, really?  It's basketball and hockey, and people want to talk about football and baseball, but there's 
[02:26:30]  nothing really going on.  Oh, I hate that.  That's hilarious.  Dumb scenarios.  Mike and the Mad Dog used to do that.  Oh, I know.  And then they would just debate over and over why.  It's like, really?  And there's no answer.  This coming from the show that just talked about which bugs would have to be what size  for us to fight them fair and square.  All right.  All right.  So maybe we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.  Yeah, but I told you during the break, the fleas as big as tennis balls bouncing around 
[02:27:00]  your part is going to make me laugh all day.  Oh, man.  Travis has all the facts wrong.  Travis corrected himself.  Obviously, the Colts are not paying Peyton Manning, and that's the big deal here.  What do you got, Ron, in Indy?  Man, they're releasing so they don't have to pay him that $28 million.  Yeah, we know that already.  We corrected ourselves there.  Sorry, I was on the hold there.  I guess I missed it.  Oh, okay, okay.  Anything else you want to add to that?  I know you guys are really bummed that you have to say goodbye to Peyton Manning. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, you guys built that stadium for him.  I'm completely bummed, man.  He brought the championship to the city.  You know, it's just a bad day.  Bad day.  Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.  Sorry about that.  No worries.  Thanks, Ron.  It really does show you how quickly things can turn.  He was the greatest quarterback of our generation, and now he's done.  That's it.  It just takes one injury, and your legacy is, you know. 
[02:28:00]  They should have just paid him the money.  Fuck it.  He should just retire.  Just for all the money he brought into that organization.  That's why fucking sports, especially football, the chance of getting injured, and then just  that's it.  You're done.  You're right on top.  You're the biggest.  Oh, you're done.  Bye.  Bye.  Do you have a pretty face?  Can you go on TV?  Can you talk?  Yeah.  Can you do a little commentary?  Then maybe you can extend your into another career, but for the most part, you're done. 
[02:28:30]  I forgot what the average age was.  The average age of football.  It's actually eight years old now.  Eight years old.  Eight years old is the end of your sports career now.  Wow.  It's really dipped down.  You know what I always think when I'm watching football?  You know when a player gets injured and they carry him off the field?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm even talking about the ones where they got one player on each side.  Oh, yeah.  His arm around the players and they kind of limp off.  See, when you're just watching a game and you see that, you're not thinking anything  about it, really.  You're like, oh, that guy is just injured. 
[02:29:00]  He'll be back next week.  Yeah.  You know how many of those guys you just watched walk off the field for the last time  and have no idea?  Obviously, when it's a player, you really know.  Yeah.  It's all over the place.  But the peripheral players.  I mean, there's maybe a little thing in the sports section, sure.  But in general, you have no idea.  It's local.  You're watching these guys walk off the field for the last time.  His hometown paper.  There might be a story.  Right, right.  But for the most part, you just watch the guy end his career right there and you're just  like, all right, whatever.  You assume most of the guys are going to come back and certainly a lot of them do. 
[02:29:30]  But so many never come back on the field.  And it's not like that in any other sport.  When a guy has a career-ending injury in baseball or basketball, you know the next day  because it's so rare.  Well, like Corey Lytle, yeah.  Corey Lytle had a fucking career-ending injury.  Oh, boy, did he.  Yeah.  That was a fucking curveball.  Yeah.  It was an amazing curveball.  Hard to come back from that one.  I think that curveball will be in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah, yeah.  Dr. Ruth.  Dr. Ruth was interviewed by our own Sam Roberts. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Yes.  And Sam had explained a few things to the great Dr. Ruth, who's been around forever.  Yeah.  Yeah, but she hasn't kept up with her information, I guess.  Me and my brother used to hang out with these two broads when we were growing up.  We were in high school.  My brother was barely a year younger than me, a little over a year younger than me.  And our thing was to get beers and drive around with these girls and listen to Dr. Ruth. 
[02:30:30]  Do you remember listening to Dr. Ruth when it used to be a big fucking deal?  It was a big deal.  Because you were hearing shit.  Sex.  You just never heard anywhere.  That was...  I know I'm fucking dating myself here, but that was a big fucking deal.  It was because it was the only place you could really hear sexual content.  Right.  And you'd be listening and go, oh, they're talking about butt sex.  Right.  Whoa.  And you'd just pop your bones.  Now, the anal must be prepared. 
[02:31:00]  Because she would talk about preparing the anal for sex.  Right.  And you'd be like, what?  Yeah, and then you always had a picture of Dr. Ruth preparing her anal for sex.  Her anal.  Her ass.  And it always took you out of the fucking scenario.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oof.  Oof.  But anyway, how old is she now?  83.  83.  Still talking about sex.  Oh, yeah.  She just came out with a new book.  Called what?  Sexually Speaking. 
[02:31:30]  It's a...  Stop it.  Dr. Ruth.  Female Sexual Health Guide.  When was the last time she had an orgasm?  Come on.  She said she doesn't answer questions about her experience.  I know.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but she wants to know all about us.  Really?  Right.  I would have fucking grilled her, Sam.  Well, there's no reason to grill her.  She was a nice lady and said I had a nice smile.  It turns out she's nice.  You should have went 60 minutes on her ass right there.  I was flirting with her.  What?  Yeah.  You know what that means?  She hasn't had sex or certainly good sex in decades.  That's why she doesn't talk about it.  Or she'd talk about it. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Is she still married?  I think she had a marriage there last time we saw her, which is probably over 10 years ago now.  I'm not sure.  Again, we were flirting, so I didn't get into the marriage stuff.  Well.  Would you go there?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  You'd have to.  Stop it.  How are the boobs?  Good?  It was hard to tell.  She was wearing a black.  Of course, it's hard to tell.  She's old.  Gravity.  How's the ass?  The ass is still there.  Nice?  The ass is still there.  Yeah.  No.  Dead ass.  There's no way.  Dead ass.  Yeah.  How was the mouth?  Good?  Mouth could do its job. 
[02:32:30]  Nice mouth?  Mm-hmm.  No funny smells coming from the mouth yet?  No.  I mean, not funny.  Pauline.  You know.  Why the fuck would you even talk about having sex with Dr. Ruth?  Why wouldn't you?  Would you at least let her take her hand and put it on your boner?  All right.  Let me think about that.  No.  You wouldn't get a handjob from Dr. Ruth?  No.  Those fucking rheumatoid arthritis knuckles wrapped around your dick.  What if she lubed it up nice so you didn't feel the calc?  She couldn't.  Yeah.  She couldn't possibly crank fast enough. 
[02:33:00]  A handjob from Dr. Ruth would be the greatest sexual experience you could have.  Is that like getting a CD signed?  Exactly.  You'd get a handjob from Dr. Ruth.  It's like memorabilia.  It's like getting an autographed Babe Ruth ball.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Same thing.  Yeah.  I'd let her cup my balls.  You would?  That's as far as you'd go?  Just cup and a little shake and then...  What if you got hard, though?  You didn't expect to, but you ended up getting hard.  I wouldn't care.  That's a great question.  I'd finish myself off.  No, but she's there.  Thinking of somebody else than Dr. Ruth. 
[02:33:30]  What if she seductively takes off her old lady blouse?  It's impossible for her to seductively do anything.  Are you sure?  Oh, man.  She might have some moves.  No, she's got not...  You don't think she had moves?  She has Mary a move left.  Look at the floral blouse.  She takes the old...  Yeah, that floral blouse is on your bedroom floor.  That looks like fucking couch slipcovers from Grandma's house.  Look at that pointer finger, man.  Would you let her stick that up your ass?  Ah, look, yeah.  It does look like she's ready to do some probing.  I'm ready to probe you. 
[02:34:00]  Would you allow her to go two knuckles deep with that fucking finger?  No.  Why not?  She would have to leave the glasses on the whole time, though.  She's blind as a bat?  No, no, no.  I'm saying for me.  Oh, you need the glasses?  Yeah.  And then you'd bukkake on her glasses?  I don't know what I would do in the moment, but that's a possibility.  Imagine how she'd look making that, I just got cum all in my face face, where she like  purses her lips and like, shuts her eyes halfway.  She would lick her lips.  She would enjoy it.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if she was seductively like licking her lips?  I hate those videos. 
[02:34:30]  Maybe she's biting your lower lip for you.  I hate those videos where a guy's going, come in your face, and he's jerking, and the girl's  like, oh, mm, ah, and she opens her mouth, and she's like, ah, and the second the cum  comes out, you realize she'd rather have lava thrown in her face.  She's like, oh, yeah, and she's like, mm, mm, mm, mm, and you can just tell she hates  having cum in her face.  How about to get an editor?  I know, right?  Because obviously she's not enjoying it like you're hoping.  No, she hates it.  That's so true. 
[02:35:00]  Dr. Ruth was taught a thing or two by her own young Sam.  Ah, you educated her?  Sexual dynamo, Sam.  Yes.  Which one is that?  I don't know.  Let's see what you taught.  Has this interview aired anywhere?  Yeah, it was on Sunday.  Ah, too late then.  That's too bad.  Why?  I want to play a game.  What did Sam teach Dr. Ruth?  Not that many people listen to my show on Sunday.  Not that many?  I wouldn't say that.  I would say none.  Here's, uh, Sam and Dr. Ruth. 
[02:35:30]  Um, and I was watching your video about anal sex.  Oh, right in.  Explain to the people why she's got a video out there where she's having anal sex?  I was doing a little research and I was watching, and this was a current video, a YouTube video  that she had just posted about the dangers of, uh, having anal to vaginal sex.  This cock-blocking bitch.  Yeah.  Tell her to shut up about dangers of fucking...  Well, she said they're bacterias that can come from the anal, and if you go straight  to the vaginal, that can be dangerous. 
[02:36:00]  There's bacteria everywhere.  How about ass to mouth?  Huh?  Oh, you bring...  Oh, boy.  How about ass to mouth?  I might have just given away the whole clip.  How about ass to mouth?  Oh, boy.  You might have given away the whole clip.  All right.  A...  Having anal sex into vaginal sex is not good.  That's what I was watching.  First of all, you see, that's, for example, you're a young person.  Yes.  20 years ago, nobody would have talked about anal sex, or very rarely.  Now I say to especially women, in a serious way, don't ever, ever engage in anal sex and 
[02:36:30]  then vaginal sex because of infections.  Yes.  If some, if a couple likes to engage in anal sex, make sure you are clean because there  are lots of nerve endings.  I do understand that.  Whoever does...  She's got some nerve.  Don't ever pressure your partner by saying, I heard something about that.  You have to for anal, you dummy.  Don't pressure your partner.  You're not having anal sex. 
[02:37:00]  She's not going to bring it up.  You got to do the little dick slip thing.  Whoops.  Whoa.  Well, as long as I'm here, let me push.  Oh, I hate her.  Why do you hate Dr. Ruth?  I don't know, because I don't think she has sex.  Don't have it.  I don't think she ever had sex.  She probably had some.  Does she have kids?  I don't know.  She doesn't talk about her personal life.  What the fuck is with her?  But she wants to talk about everyone else's personal life.  Yeah.  She's willing to answer questions. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Try it, too.  They both have to want to do it.  What do you think of the practice, though?  You talk about this anal sex to vaginal sex.  Here we go.  Have you heard people talk ATM, which is ass to mouth?  People are doing anal sex to oral sex.  You see, people, it's good I came to the radio station.  You've never heard of this?  I never heard of that.  What?  How does she go through life not hearing about ass to mouth?  Doesn't mean she doesn't have to talk about it, but she sucks then as an expert. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I thought so, too.  But there is something going on with the educational process, because I was telling some of the girls  who work here.  Oh.  Nicole was one of them.  You're looking for a fucking HR problem, my friend.  But listen, I was saying, no, just talking about the interview.  You were asking girls around here for anal sex?  For ass to mouth, specifically.  Fuck, man, for ass to mouth.  Yeah.  You're so fired.  Thank God.  You are.  They thought ass to mouth was putting one's mouth to one's ass.  That's ass on mouth.  I said, no.  No.  No.  That's the rusty trombone. 
[02:38:30]  The dick goes from the penis.  Yeah.  Ass to the mouth.  Now, if that's dangerous, what about ass eating?  That's always gotten off on a...  I don't think people really have a problem with that.  I don't think so.  That the bacteria is there.  It's just a fun thing.  It's great.  Let's see what she says.  You've never heard of this.  I never heard of that.  So I will...  I look into it.  Ass to mouth is what it's called.  I will look into it.  And maybe you put a YouTube video out on YouTube.com slash Dr. Ruth. 
[02:39:00]  Next question.  I noticed.  What a seductive laugh.  I would have...  It's like a fucking super criminal.  I'm going to give you a B minus in that.  You did pretty good there.  What do you mean a B minus?  But I would have just kept going with the whole ass to mouth thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Because she was uncomfortable.  I would have said, who gives a fuck what else this dumb broad is going to tell me?  Next question.  And just obsessively talk about ass to mouth.  I like maintaining a balance, though.  I know.  Ebs and flows.  I guess that's you.  I would have not let her off the hook. 
[02:39:30]  When she said, next question.  Well, that's why you've been described as a destroyer.  Well, yeah.  You know.  What's wrong with that?  You wouldn't move on and just talk about something else?  And you know what?  Fixate on ass to mouth with Dr. Ruth?  You would have been right there with me on that one.  Oh, I'd have been covering up going, Opie, she wants to talk about other things.  Let's move on.  And then she'd go, yes, Opie, let's move on like Anthony has said.  And then you'd be like, hey, Dr. Ruth, how about that ass to mouth?  And I'd be like, oh, see, I don't know.  He's incorrigible, Dr. Ruth. 
[02:40:00]  See, good cop, bad cop again.  But I think it would be two bad cops.  I think you would really get off on the whole thing that we had her squirming.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I would try to keep her going with me saying like, well, let's get into some other  things.  And then I would throw in little ass to mouth things.  Right.  What else could she talk about?  It's all about the ass to mouth with her.  I have to be the good cop and the bad cop, though, since it's just me.  I would have just pushed.  She doesn't like it because every line she stands on is ass to mouth for her because  she's short.  See? 
[02:40:30]  Poor Dr. Ruth.  She's so low.  All right.  And then you asked her about this.  Another thing she didn't know about.  She didn't know about it.  Have you heard the phrase DTF?  What is DTF?  Well, it means down to fuck.  That's something I could say here because we're on, I know, we're on satellite.  I wouldn't say that.  No.  I would never say that word.  You wouldn't.  You wouldn't say that.  I would say sexual intercourse.  Okay.  Down to half.  She doesn't even say fuck.  She doesn't.  Oh, I love how you sexually intercourse me.  Oh, sexually intercourse me harder.  Oh, no. 
[02:41:00]  It's fuck.  Fuck me.  Right.  Whether it's sexual intercourse-er.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dr. Ruth.  Sex intercourse.  Okay.  Down to have.  Hopefully leading to orgasm.  Down to have sexual intercourse, hopefully leading to orgasm.  Um, what do you think of this idea that, uh, some men want women to have the attitude going  in that they are indeed DTF.  The attitude.  Down to have sexual intercourse that would hopefully lead to orgasm.  Yeah.  I, I would worry about putting the orgasm issue before the relationship. 
[02:41:30]  Yes.  I want you to first have a relationship.  Then to worry about.  What is she?  1800s?  Then you can fuck like rabbits.  You didn't say that, but I did.  I didn't say that.  How you doing?  Well, you really were flirting with her there.  We're flirting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  She was all like, oh, she was all, ooh, about that F word like that.  You know what she told the talent bookers?  Uh-oh.  I was the only interviewer that made her blush.  Oh.  Wow.  That's great. 
[02:42:00]  Did her blood pressure drop when she blushed?  Like her boobies?  I don't like having blood in my face.  It takes it away from the rest of the body that I need blood in.  It's possible.  It's a possibility?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  A hand job from Dr. Ruth would be like a tune-up from Mr. Goodwrench.  Kevin from Connecticut, good line, brother.  Oh, with those brittle, bony, fucking arthritic hands.  It'd sound like maracas.  She's jacking it off. 
[02:42:30]  I want to talk to her.  When do we get her on the show?  Yeah.  She's very compelling.  I remember at AEW, I think she ran out of the studio.  I think she was one we chased out.  See, that's the difference.  Again, because...  I need an O&A historian, but I have a recollection that there was a problem that day.  The only person that would know has a sore throat today, and he's out sick, and we should  leave him alone, because...  Why won't he allow us to rest him at home?  Because obviously he's not sick.  He's not resting.  No. 
[02:43:00]  His illness and the phone call will make him relapse.  He's fine.  He's not sick.  What video game do you think we'd be interrupting?  Oh, exactly.  Someone said...  What came out yesterday?  Mass Effect?  No.  Mass Effect.  Yeah, Mass Effect 3, right?  Someone's saying that maybe you got into the whole Mass Effect 3 hype.  Look, Eric is nowhere near the video game player to play Mass Effect 3.  Is that a tough one? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Maybe we could trick him.  Oh, are you gonna...  Oh, okay.  Maybe we could trick him.  He's gonna be like, it's Opie.  Yeah, maybe we could trick him.  Alright.  This is great.  Give him a call.  This is a great idea.  Do you think he's listening?  He brags what Opie calls him.  Opie?  The number you dialed is not a working number.  Oh, he changed his fucking number on you, Opie.  Oh, shit.  This number was working a day ago.  He's like, I ain't gonna fucking... 
[02:44:00]  Maybe quit the show.  I ain't gonna fucking let Opie have my number.  Oh, wait.  I messed up.  Uh-oh.  I called the home number, and obviously you moved, so that is correct.  Oh.  I thought you called a brontosaurus and made a mistake.  At the tone, please record your message.  Wait.  This asshole turned off all his phones.  Did you call his Blackberry or his iPhone?  I called the one that should have got him.  Start with a nine?  Yeah.  Try this one.  You could just put it on.  But he's not...  He's gonna know if it's from me.  If it's from you...  Oh, but if you hand me the phone, he won't? 
[02:44:30]  No, no.  I'm giving you the number.  Oh, so you call it?  Yeah.  Kevin is making an announcement.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Uh, E-Rock has a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up, so if anybody's interested.  It's hilarious.  All right.  What else is going on?  Uh, we got the Apple unveiling the new iPad.  Yes, everybody's very excited, and it's all so mysterious with Apple, isn't it?  What is it?  Is it gonna be the clearer screen?  People are speculating it might even be the smaller version, but I don't think so. 
[02:45:00]  iPad HD.  I will tell you right now.  I will bet money on this, and I swear I have no inside info.  Oh, shit.  This iPad will absolutely be smaller.  Why are you saying?  How much do you want to bet?  You don't think?  No.  Travis wants to bet.  Why not?  Because it doesn't make any sense.  Not, not, not, not like significantly, but I bet you it's, it's smaller.  Cool.  How much do you want to bet?  You see this black border shit?  Mm-hmm.  They'll get rid of that.  What?  So they'll have almost the same fucking screen.  But they need that. 
[02:45:30]  Why do you need the black border shit?  Because it covers, it contains, it's almost an inch.  But it contains things that can't be under the screen.  Yeah, but they got their shit smaller.  That's why they're putting out an iPad 3.  What's the bet?  A hundred dollars.  So you're saying the screen size won't be smaller.  Oh, wait.  What do you say?  The actual iPad will be smaller, but I think the screen will be the same size.  Either the same size or close.  Oh, man.  Because this is all wasted shit.  Now, what happens?  And I'm sure they got technology now that could fix that.  What happens if there's two versions? 
[02:46:00]  What do you mean?  If there's a regular version that's the same size, and then they also have a shithead  version.  I will take this bet.  This iPad 3 is going to absolutely be smaller.  I'm not saying the screen necessarily.  Because there's a lot of wasted shit.  I hear they're going to call it iPad HD.  That's what I hear, too.  That's what I hear.  Instead of 3, and keep going with the number thing, it's going to be called $100 on the  table.  It's going to be called iPad HD.  Why?  Did you look up something?  No.  There's no information.  Not to look up.  It's all rumor and speculation.  All right.  I'll take that bet.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  Wow.  You're going to help pay for my iPad HD.  Oh, nice.  But look at this.  I didn't call my contact.  Why wouldn't the whole thing be smaller if you get rid of the black shit?  Because the black border around the iPad contains electronics.  That is necessary.  And I don't think they're at the point yet that they can condense all that into the  area underneath the actual screen.  Well, what if they need that border area?  But what if you only take a little of the border away?  I don't think it's worth.  I bet the shit got a little smaller.  I don't think it's worth the size difference. 
[02:47:00]  Huh?  It's composition.  It's how it looks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  Because all screen, when you put your thumbs on the side to pick it up, you're touching  it.  Oh, you'd be on the screen, Opie.  You guys are confused.  It doesn't even have to be all screen.  I mean, you cut this border in half and you got a smaller unit.  But why that much smaller?  What's the big deal if it's that much smaller?  Because the other, the competition, they're coming out with tablets a lot smaller.  Yeah.  If I want a smaller tablet, I got my iPhone.  Well, no.  But somewhere in between.  No, I don't like in between.  I'm going off.  Because first of all, unless it fits in your pocket, you're going to have to carry it. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I hear that.  So the iPad, the size it is now, is fine.  This is going to be a bit smaller.  Yeah.  But maybe the screen is the same size.  Well, that's a bold statement.  When does it come out?  Today?  Well, it's announced today.  It's probably coming out next Friday.  But they'll basically explain if it's smaller today.  Is Steve Jobs going to hold the press conference?  With his jaw all like, down?  And the iPad will have a clearer display. 
[02:48:00]  That would be great if he came back just a zombie.  If they wanted to ruin their stock, just bring out Steve Jobs today.  That would freak everyone out.  Oh, he's just...  Investors would just leave.  They dug him up and threw his ass on the stage.  Oh, my God.  They already announced that the iPad 2 will be bigger.  What?  Nobody announced anything.  The iPad 2?  Well, that's...  I'm...  This is Rico. 
[02:48:30]  We already have that out there.  Don't listen to anybody.  Rico.  We already have the iPad 2.  No, the iPad 3.  They already had some type of a Tech Byte show on one of these news channels.  Speculating.  No, they actually shown it, that it was bigger.  No.  They don't have it.  No, they didn't.  Why would some Tech Byte show on television...  Just check online.  Rico.  No, I'll just look online for the iPad 3 online.  They're good with keeping their shit top secret.  Exactly.  Better than anybody. 
[02:49:00]  I hope you don't make that bet, bro.  It's already made.  I can't go back on a bet.  A lot of people think I went back on the Joe DeRosa push-up bet.  I did not.  I bitched a lot because I didn't think the push-ups were legal, but I fucking gave them  the money.  So people need to relax.  I don't go back on the bet.  It's me and Travis.  I say it's smaller.  Do you want to make more bets?  Why?  Well, you're finding stuff?  No, I just...  Oh, more bets in general.  Yeah, I've got common sense.  Peyton Manning to the Dolphins.  All right, you're on.  How much? 
[02:49:30]  $100.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting nervous.  Do $100.  Wow, you are really extending yourself here.  $100.  I'll tell you what.  I didn't make the bet yet.  There's far more chance that Peyton Manning goes to the Dolphins than the iPad is smaller.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Shit, he's trashed.  Smack talking.  Smack talking now.  No, I'm saying that the Dolphins bet wouldn't be bad.  Oh, sorry.  This thing's going to be smaller.  That's not...  Yes!  No.  I don't see it being smaller.  Not...  Why not just take... 
[02:50:00]  Not a big enough thing.  Why not just take...  Well, because the whole thing is the HD screen.  Only two of the sides away.  Why?  And then you got all this shit.  Why?  Why?  All this shit for the shit.  For the shit.  But why would you?  It's not aesthetically pleasing.  Because I think people want it just slightly smaller.  Nah, I don't think they do.  Especially if the screen could stay pretty much the same.  I don't think they do.  All right, I'll think about the Peyton Manning bit for a minute.  Because I got other bets, too, in the works.  You don't?  I'm spread a little thin right now with my betting. 
[02:50:30]  When is that going to be unveiled?  What, the iPad?  Yeah.  One o'clock here?  We're looking for a $5 increase in the share price of Apple computers.  Are you in?  As we speak.  No, of course not.  Why would I be?  I had nice options, call options, and I sold them for a gain.  But if I would have held on to them, I would have made a lot more money.  You think there's people out there that got really rich off the Apple stock?  I think a few people might have made a couple of bucks. 
[02:51:00]  A couple of bucks.  Right now, my big thing is writing covered calls.  That's what I do now.  What's that?  I buy a stock, and then I'm the one that's putting the options out there for the stock  for people to buy options off me.  Are you crazy?  But it's covered.  How do you learn that?  I don't know.  I just fucking read about it.  I'm like, oh, I should try that.  You're not making huge amounts of money, but it's a steady income on the premiums that  they pay for the option to buy the stock.  And then if the stock price doesn't go above the strike price that I have marked out, 
[02:51:30]  then I keep the stock anyway.  The options expire.  I get the premium, and I keep the stocks because the guy wasn't able to exercise.  Whoever bought the options never exercised the option because it never went above that  price, and I get to keep everything.  I'm amazed you figured that out, though.  That's great.  The naked calls, if you write naked calls, that's where it gets dangerous because then  you don't own the stock.  And if the stock price goes way up and someone calls you out on it, now you've got to buy  the stock at the new price. 
[02:52:00]  So it could be an unlimited loss that you chalked up.  Fuck that.  And you've got to be...  What's the upside of that one?  That you never had to buy the stock in the first place.  If it went way low.  So if it went down, you would...  Yeah, yeah.  So...  I got a...  You know, I got a stock tip for everyone.  Oh.  Wow.  A little company named Google.  Wow.  You know what?  I'm going to look that up.  I'm going to search that on Google and see what that's all about.  Can you imagine, though? 
[02:52:30]  Fuck.  Why didn't we go with the Google?  Google.  Apple again.  How rich would we have been?  Oh, man.  If we would have went Google instead of Citadel.  Let's say 10,000...  Well, all right.  Let's say Citadel money.  $100,000 worth of Google when?  When?  Back in...  How about...  How about...  At its inception when it first went fucking public.  Well, that's how we got Citadel.  That is.  What was Google's IPO?  IPO cost of Google was...  And I bet you it's around the same time, right?  Don't you think? 
[02:53:00]  01?  Someone's saying?  01 is around the time we got Citadel.  I don't know.  More or less.  So, instead of taking that $100,000, when we had unlimited funds, obviously.  I can't trust people when I first see the amount coming.  So, it's $85 per share.  When?  We want, like, the...  2004?  2004.  2004.  We want the IPO.  Yeah.  It's $600 in 2007. 
[02:53:30]  It's over $600 now.  No, I don't think...  I think Google's over $600.  Over $600?  What is it today?  I'm pretty sure.  So, we could have got a share for $85 instead of the dumb Citadel shit.  Oh, yeah.  604.  Yeah.  It's 604 today?  Yeah.  604.  So, we would have had a gain of...  So, let's call it $520 difference.  $520 difference per share.  How many shares could we have gotten at $85 a share for $100,000?  I don't feel like doing that math today.  I don't...  I could do it.  I can do it, but I don't feel like... 
[02:54:00]  $85,000 would have gotten us $1,000 shares.  So, you figure...  What's that?  $1,200 shares.  Oh, no.  It would have been $1,100 shares.  $1,100 shares.  Would be a little closer anyway.  Yeah.  So, $1,100 into $520 per share.  Uh-huh.  Oh, fuck.  Uh-huh.  What is that?  Someone says it's $7,000,000,000.  Damn it.  $7,000,000,000.  That's Kevin.  Again, Kevin from Connecticut.  We would have had $7,000,000,000.  $7,000,000,000. 
[02:54:30]  I think...  You're an asshole.  I think Travis cheated on our bet.  Did he?  Yep.  Why?  Because macrumors.com already has all sorts of info on the fucking...  Macrumors.com.  People are saying $115,000.  It's rumors.  We would have made $115,000.  That's it?  $115,000.  That's it.  It would have been more.  Well, if we would have taken that $115,000 and keep rebuying new shares...  Oh, would it?  Because we didn't do that with Citadel.  No, of course we didn't.  We didn't have the opportunity.  Right.  So our $100,000...  We'd have more than doubled our money.  $11,000,000 shares.  Much more.  Wait a minute. 
[02:55:00]  Should have been much more than that.  Oh, there should be...  $710,000.  Yeah, exactly.  It has to be...  Fucking asshole.  It has to be well over a half million.  Why am I trusting Paltalk people?  You got the number.  It would be what?  Closer to $700,000, right?  Yeah, you guys have cell phones, right?  You guys have calculators?  I know.  You know how to use cell phones, right?  I know.  Here, watch this.  $100,000, right?  And then you divide by 85.  Yeah.  That means you have $1,176 shares.  We figured that out with our brains.  Now the share is at what price?  $605?  No, it's $520.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So $11,76 times five what? 
[02:55:30]  Five?  Five-twenty.  Twenty.  You got $611,000.  For a gain of $611,000.  But what do we have instead, Ed?  What do we have today?  Nothing.  Zero.  Zero.  Zilt's bankrupt company.  And then the cost to buy and then the commissions on that.  So you're looking at it.  You probably would have made a half mil.  Yeah, half mil.  Jesus Christ.  But instead we made zero.  Yeah.  We actually lost $110.  And you know, if we bought the shares at $85 a share, you know we would have held and  not punched out when it got to $100 a share.  And we would have made fucking $15 a share. 
[02:56:00]  And we would have held it until it went to $600.  We wouldn't have cashed out at $100, $200, $300, $400, $500.  Because how we handled our Citadel stock dictates that we would have held.  Exactly.  Because we had a million chances to get out of Citadel before we lost every single penny  of it.  I was contemplating punching out a $22.  Put it that way.  Contemplating.  And I wish I had.  The only reason I did was because that was a weekend.  Yes.  If you remember, it was a weekend.  We were up. 
[02:56:30]  Nice.  And it never went over the IPO price again.  Oh, no.  It dropped quickly after $22.  And that was it.  Never even saw close to $19.  Yep.  All right.  We'll cut us.  So we got the, you know what?  I got the first iPad.  So I'm going to get this new one.  Oh, you got an iPad 1 over there.  I skipped two.  You skipped two?  I just skipped two.  It didn't have anything I really needed.  I think people look stupid holding it up to take pictures and all.  I really do. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, you could really just use your phone.  But now I'll, I like buying like every other one.  Yeah.  You're a guy that has to buy every one, right?  No, the casino got me one, so I didn't have to buy it.  But no, I mean shit in general, though.  Yeah.  iPad cost me a few thousand dollars.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  No, I do like getting the new technology right when it comes out.  I'm that guy.  I'm the guy that Apple loves.  Yeah.  You know, because they can instantly, the next day, say, wow, what a great day we had 
[02:57:30]  selling our, and then insert electronics that Anthony will buy here.  A lot of people saying, nice cameo from Mr. Danny Ross.  Ah, yeah.  They like the Danny Ross cameo.  Danny ran in, gave some pertinent information, and then ran back.  Because he was completely out of breath.  He's in shape now.  He's in shape.  Kirk Cameron defends gay marriage comments, and he should.  Oh, I thought you were going to say defends gay marriage. 
[02:58:00]  No, his comments, because people are attacking him.  He should defend it.  That's what he thinks.  Doogie Howser's pissed at him, though.  What's his latest tweet on that?  Oh, I just saw the one where he's like, oh, well, Kirk Cameron, this guy's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he has the right to say what he wants.  That's his belief.  I think he's an asshole.  Who am I to step on that guy's belief?  I think he's an asshole.  What did Alan Thicke tweet?  Was that the real Alan Thicke tweeting the spanking thing yesterday?  I would think so.  That Alan Thicke looks like a load of laughs. 
[02:58:30]  Alan underscore Thicke.  And like I said, I don't follow those underscores.  Something creepy about that.  I hate anything with an underscore.  That's right.  I don't even know what it is.  It's not quite a dash.  It's like a dash that fell down.  What's his tweet?  Just because he played his dad on TV, he felt like he had a comment on this.  Yeah.  There's a spanking tweet in there somewhere, unless he got rid of it.  Alan Thicke.  Sam.  Well, this one says...  We're just staring at you.  Help me, please.  Oh, my God. 
[02:59:00]  T-Boeing is done.  World now kirking.  That's where you get on one knee, make a fist, and punch a picture of Tracy Gold.  Why would he write that?  He could have fit more kids in, more of his TV kids.  More growing pains references.  Growing pains.  Come on, where's the spanking one?  I don't see any spanking one.  How many hours ago?  Fifteen.  How about you go a day or two?  I gotta read them.  Who would have thought Tracy Gold fucking was an anorexic?  Kirk Cameron is a religious nut who doesn't like the gay. 
[02:59:30]  And Boner's dead.  Yeah.  He wrote, I love Kirk.  I may have to spank him, though not in a gay way.  Alan Thicke wrote that.  Alan Thicke.  That's kind of good.  That's all right, huh?  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  That's gotta piss off Kirk Cameron.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Thicke.  So he's defending.  That's fine if that's what you believe, I guess.  What am I gonna do about it?  Yeah.  A lot of people just fucking don't like the Kirk Cameron's comments. 
[03:00:00]  No.  I know a lot of people do like it, so.  He wasn't gay bashing.  He was just saying, you know, he was asked and gave his point of view on it.  He doesn't like it.  No, sir.  I don't like it.  This guy says, Anthony, Budweiser stock he bought.  You know what?  It's worth taking the call.  Fuck it.  John in Denver.  John.  I hope you got to thinking, concerning that money you spent on that Citadel stock, if you  were taking that $100,000, invested it in Budweiser, and I don't mean the stocks, but I mean 
[03:00:30]  cans of beer, drank the beer, you could recycle the aluminum today for $470.  More than we got from Citadel.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  We got zero from Citadel.  Yeah.  With no chance of it ever coming back because they went bankrupt.  So anything would have been better than buying Citadel stock.  Right.  Yeah.  I thought you bought Budweiser stock.  Beer stocks, they don't move enough.  They don't move.  Not enough action for me. 
[03:01:00]  Not enough action.  The monkeys are going to skip Davy Jones' funeral to prevent media circus.  What?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you go and say goodbye to your pal there?  Yeah.  You want the answer?  Yeah.  Okay.  Their family, or his family, rather.  Davy Jones' family?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a private funeral.  Right.  So they felt that if they attend, it'll just be, you know, a media frenzy.  And since they're going to do two public memorials for him in New York and London, they'll probably 
[03:01:30]  do something there.  This is celebrity bullshit.  Um, why wouldn't you just go without telling anyone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't have to announce what you're going to be doing.  Right.  Make a big announcement.  How would anyone know if you're there or not?  If you're going or not going unless you fucking announce it.  Right.  Jeez.  That is real Hollywood bullshit.  You're right.  It is bullshit.  It's like when they announced to the paparazzi where they're going to be.  It's the same shit.  I've been in L.A. enough to know that there's plenty of places you could go where the paparazzi  are just not going to be there. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Every time you see a celebrity getting completely swarmed by paparazzi is because they're in  on it for the most part.  Yeah.  They decide to go.  One of the big roads is Robertson, right?  Robertson Boulevard or Robertson.  I guess it's called Boulevard out there in L.A.  They go there purposely because that's where the paparazzi just hangs out in between chasing  people.  That's where to be seen.  Yeah.  And celebrities do it every day.  And then they cross the street and like, oh, God, I'm being bothered.  Oh, my God.  When this is the ground zero for paparazzi, you know, is this Robertson Boulevard. 
[03:02:30]  I guess the Ivy's there, that place.  Oh, do tell.  Bob wanted to take me there once when I was out there in L.A.  Oh, yeah?  I will guarantee that I would have been chased by paparazzi.  Yeah.  Would have been a nice, peaceful dinner.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  No problems.  There's nothing worse than walking out of somewhere and having the paparazzi out there  with their cameras down.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, that makes you feel good about 30 years of radio. 
[03:03:00]  Know who I am.  Yeah.  We just don't care, though.  Yeah.  No, I don't even want to ask.  Yeah.  I just assume they didn't recognize me.  So the Monkees will skip Davy Jones' funeral to prevent media circus.  And Hulk Hogan's sex tape.  What do you know about this there, Sam?  Whoa, let's go to Sam Roberts, our insider into the world of wrestling.  What's going on?  I'm embarrassed for him.  I was reading about it this morning.  Yeah.  Apparently, somebody has seen grainy footage. 
[03:03:30]  It's definitely the Hulkster, not with his wife.  And it's not, like, old.  Oh, it's not his old wife.  It's his new wife.  No, it's not.  It's not with Linda.  Really?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hulkster.  Or his current wife.  Grainy video.  Sex?  Actual sex?  Sex.  Sex.  Intercourse, as Dr. Ruth would say.  I would imagine he looks as bad as Gene Simmons.  Oh, yeah.  How do you describe it?  Like an old lion?  Like an old lion humping.  You see him on those fucking wildlife channels. 
[03:04:00]  An old fucking lion, and he's got the female lion by her loins with his front paws, and he's  doing that underslung ass move.  Ugh!  Ugh!  Just fucking with the dumb face on.  That's what Gene Simmons looked like when he was fucking in his horrid porno.  Apparently, in the tape, the Hulkster took his shirt off and bragged,  I'm starting to work out again, and had a thong-shaped tan line.  Ugh!  Jesus. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, God.  Why?  Oh, God.  That's what he tans in.  Ugh.  Did he rip her panties off like he does his shirt?  And just start going down on her?  And put his hand by her?  I am a real American.  Did he, like, play any music?  Was there any music in the background?  Hulkster in Heaven?  Do we have clips of his tape yet?  No.  It hasn't been released.  And nobody's bought it yet.  Somebody's just shopping it.  Do you think this is why Eric took the day off?  Yeah.  To jerk off? 
[03:05:00]  Ah, to jerk off to the Hulk tape!  You know who uses this music, don't you?  I do.  Who?  Newt Gingrich.  Really?  Yeah.  That's lame.  It's all about this song.  Is that Hulk?  No, it doesn't.  No, I don't think it is.  Oh.  They would have showed his head if it was him.  Yeah.  Some guy on the beach with a thong on.  Newt Gingrich.  Yeah?  Would you ever wear a thong yet?  No.  Even if you were in Europe and it was the thing to do?  I wouldn't do anything those Europeans do. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, I don't get the fucking thong thing.  That's stupid.  If you go, like, on cruises, a lot of times you'll see a few European men who think it's  fine to just parade around in front of women and children with their balls.  With a tiny little bathing suit?  Yeah, with a little ball bag and a string going up their ass.  Yeah, I don't get it.  It's European.  So it is fine.  There is no reason to not.  Yeah, there is. 
[03:06:00]  Being a child of the 80s when I was growing up, we had small bathing suits.  Because they didn't invent the board shorts yet or anything.  No board shorts.  No jams.  So I do remember we kind of wore, but I think they were like, well, I guess officially boy  shorts.  Yeah.  But they were.  They were like old gym shorts?  Like the ones, like old basketball shorts that they used to wear?  They went up pretty high, because I remember being out in Waiting River in my grandma's  house, being sunburned way up here.  A bathing suit. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, but I'm saying when we were growing up, they were absolutely small.  Because they didn't invent the, you know, they're called board shorts.  Pop a 1970s bathing suit, men's bathing suit.  Because I remember used to getting sunburned way up here in it.  Yeah, yeah.  And I haven't been sunburned above my knees, and I couldn't tell you the last time.  Go to images.  Jesus.  See, that's not.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are bathing suits right there.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Unfortunately, we definitely had those growing up. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  But they're still a lot bigger than ball bags.  No, yeah.  They cover everything.  But they are, in essence, hot pants.  Let me see the images.  You're wearing hot pants.  Yeah, man.  They went up high.  I remember you used to getting burned way up in my fucking thighs.  Look at a gay porno we're looking at here.  What is that?  They're wearing these tight little bathing suits.  I don't know.  You can see their dick right through there.  I don't know.  Why was this acceptable?  Why couldn't we figure out baggy shorts back then?  I don't know. 
[03:07:30]  Why couldn't we figure it out?  I don't understand why we couldn't figure out shit that makes sense.  Mark Spitz wore one of those.  Holy fuck.  He has no penis.  No, he's Jewish.  Oh, my God.  Jews aren't.  How do we never notice that?  Mark Spitz doesn't have a penis.  Mark Spitz has not.  It's like a fucking Ken doll or a G.I. Joe.  Now I understand why he had to win all those gold medals.  He had no water resistance either.  I guarantee if he had a big hog, he would have stopped at one and said, you know, look,  I only need one gold medal because I got a big fucking hog. 
[03:08:00]  No keel on that guy.  I don't get it.  We had.  No, never that small, though, Sam.  No, that's women's bikini bottom looking.  How about 80s?  Early 80s.  That's when I was growing up.  80s might be more of a, yeah, okay, that's more shorts.  Like, it got away from the, it got away from looking like a tighty-whitey type bathing suit.  Where it went up on the sides.  Where it went to boxer type bathing suit. 
[03:08:30]  But short boxers.  Like, I remember getting sunburned, I'm telling you, way up on the fucking side of the leg.  Yeah, yeah.  That skin is sensitive.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Now you just wear things that are down mid-calf, fucking all puffy and bulgy.  You get out of the pool and you weigh 20 pounds more because the pockets are full of water.  The material's wet.  You can't even dive under because you've got fucking air bubbles everywhere. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  So I guess there was something to be said about something that was tight to your skin.  Yeah.  You could get some swimming in at least.  Yeah.  Nowadays you're like, fuck.  I was watching some of the old home movies that I posted some things on YouTube.  Yeah.  And some of the adults at the bungalow.  And they were constantly pushing each other in the pools.  Like, that's what you did.  You're dressed.  And they were like, one guy was walking along the side of the pool.  And another guy would just come running and tackle him into the pool. 
[03:09:30]  Both of them fully clothed.  And it's like, the days of doing that are done.  Because of the cell phone.  Yeah.  You have so many different types of electronics on you now that there's, it's expensive.  Because back then it was kind of, it was definitely funny.  God, try my money out now.  Right.  Damn you.  Yeah.  My license is wet.  Back then it was funny.  But now you're considered, it's still funny, but you're absolutely considered by an asshole.  You are not dunking someone in the pool, pushing him in.  And that guy is going to pop his head up and call you a fucking asshole. 
[03:10:00]  And there will be an argument, if not a fight.  Because it's almost an unwritten rule.  You know it now.  It's like, what are you, what are you stupid?  Yeah, I got you.  That's what that Australian guy did that fucking put my landscaping in for my pool.  All right.  During my first pool party I had.  And he's like, oh, Anthony, come here, come here.  And he's sitting on a chair by the pool.  I was like, what, what?  I just want to say, and then bam, he pushes me and I'm like, what are you, an idiot?  What year do you think this is?  See, that's why I can't have a bee stinger or a gun. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  I would have shot him.  Bee stinger, you would have been dead.  Bee stinger guarantee.  Your own guts would have come out your ass on the end of that stinger.  But it would have been better to shoot him then.  Yeah.  Because I wouldn't be dead.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was very angry.  That's why I can't be a gun guy.  Shit like that.  Oh, boy.  I'd just have to unload on.  Oh, I'd get itchy.  You'd have to just fuck.  I don't know if I would officially shoot.  I really don't know, but I know I would get really itchy.  But you'd pull it out on the motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, I would.  Yo, bitch.  That's how it is at rap parties.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  They just don't care.  Ah, here you go.  I'm going to pull it out.  Sam, we're going old school.  We need Danny Noonan's shorts in Caddy Shirt.  Oh, yes.  Yes, exactly.  Pool day.  Danny Noonan's shorts in, I don't remember how short they were.  It was at the pool, the Caddy Shirt.  Oh, boy.  When they opened up the pool for, I think it was 15 minutes to the Caddy Shirt.  Danny Noonan's pool.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow. 
[03:11:30]  No.  Oh, my God.  Sam.  What do you put in the search?  Danny Noonan shorts, Danny Noonan pool.  Put in Caddy Shack pool.  Yeah.  Yeah, Caddy Shack pool.  Yeah, then they have no choice.  They have to show you pool shots.  Okay.  All right, good.  And let's see if.  Let's see.  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, could you show me that naked girl while we're at it?  Let's see if she's hot.  Oh, yeah.  Was she?  Yeah, she was hot.  Look at that.  Oh, and it's a fucking video. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, man.  Because when you saw that in the movie.  She's wearing bottoms, though, yeah.  That was a one-second scene in the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  But, man, they slowed it down nice for us.  I never realized she was on the lifeguard's shoulders.  I guess.  She had a tiny little bottom on, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Look at those.  Who is she?  How old is she now?  Oh, boy.  Don't even go there.  Oh, my God.  Where's Paul O. on the side of the pool?  Caddy Shack.  True.  He was in there.  I heard it on the Rana Fez show. 
[03:12:30]  The pool O.  I miss naked girls in movies.  I miss naked girls.  They're coming back.  Anywhere is good.  Fine.  But they're coming back, finally.  They're finally pretty good.  They're bringing back the nude girl?  Yeah, that cheap nude shot.  Cheap, gratuitous nudity in movies?  Finally, they're going back to that.  Thank God.  It was missed.  Girls are just sexual objects.  They really are.  Just stop with this fucking faking it shit that we're looking at them in any other way but as sexual objects. 
[03:13:00]  Stop trying to rise above.  Yeah.  You don't need to.  We love you naked and sexual.  I know we talk about the same shit over and over again, but I'm a big gym guy.  What drives me nuts and I get really mad, they just, they got like, they got sports bras and fucking, fucking, the outfits on, girls suck now.  Unless they're going into yoga, then for some reason it's just amazing. 
[03:13:30]  But just a girl that you know has a good body going into the gym, you don't get a nice little thing, a little peak, a little something.  Remember seeing girls jogging when everything was bouncing, everything.  Their tits are just bouncing.  It would drive you insane, you'd be all like worked up.  I see these girls running, you know, four minute miles at the gym and nothing moves.  Yeah.  It's like, fuck.  Why do they have to figure that out?  And let me tell you, ladies.  You don't even know how big their boobs are anymore. 
[03:14:00]  No, no.  Because it's all just scrapped down tight.  No matter how smart you are, how far you've gotten in business, anything, as men, when we look at you, the first thing we're looking at is a sexual object.  Oh, absolutely.  We don't give a shit if you're in the boardroom with your fucking smart businesswoman suit on.  That'll never change.  We're trying to figure out what your ass looks like and tits look like through that suit, and if you shave your pussy or not, if you fucked last night, what your tits are like, nipple placement. 
[03:14:30]  All that is being computed in our heads before we ever get even near how smart is she and how could she handle this.  We compute all that stuff before we can say hi.  Oh, it's amazing how fast that calculation's made.  But, I mean, the yoga thing, the yoga pants are pretty amazing, absolutely.  But besides that, man, they strap everything fucking down.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  I used to like my cheap thrills as I went through my day.  A cheap thrill is better, sometimes better, unless you're going to close the deal and actually fuck. 
[03:15:00]  But a cheap thrill is...  Or just walking around, you used to get a nice cheap thrill.  More girls used to not wear bras.  Side tit when a girl's bending downward and she's wearing some kind of wife beater or something.  And she like bends over to get something and you see side tit.  It's fantastic, women.  You don't even know how fantastic that is.  And now you see one every once in a while and you go, oh boy, that girl sure is a slut.  Oh, slut.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  That's nice. 
[03:15:30]  Yoga pants.  How about when a girl, when, you know, maybe you're at the stationery store and you're in the card aisle.  And the cards that the girl's looking at is way on the bottom level.  And she squats down and the panties are sticking out of the top of her.  That's fantastic.  You can't look away as a guy.  Can't look away.  You don't get those moments just walking through life anymore.  You used to.  How many times have you done this?  The elevator door opens up.  A girl with ample breasts that has a low-cut top on is right there.  And you just realize you just stared completely at her tits. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  Because the door opens.  And it's like, it's like, tits!  Like, you're not thinking eyes.  Or let me at least see if she's looking at where my eyes are going.  It's, tits!  Because they're right there in your face.  But she's got to know.  She's got to know.  She's got to accept it.  Sorry.  I'll tell you right now, man.  If I was a woman and I had nice tits, I would absolutely be fucking flaunting them.  You'd have to, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Why not? 
[03:16:30]  Yep.  Why not?  Wow, that's a...  That's pretty nice, right?  I could see your vagina through those yoga pants.  Yeah.  But the problem is, at a regular gym, girls aren't walking around, really, with the yoga pants.  No.  You need the yoga pants to get all those stretches in.  Sure.  But they just batten down all body parts in the regular gym now.  It's too bad.  You girls are amazing walking around with thongs, though.  Just a fucking piece of material right against your asshole.  I don't get that.  It's fucking amazing.  You girls willing to put up with that? 
[03:17:00]  Wow.  That's some ass.  What are these, yoga asses?  Mm-hmm.  Fucking A.  Yeah.  Best site you've ever found.  No.  Yoga pants.  Sam Roberts, finally.  I think it's just called Yoga Pants online.  God.  The actual website.  Holy mother of fuck.  Yeah, see, they don't always have to be completely naked for the turn-on.  Look at that.  I know you like totally nude, but sometimes it's...  I like totally naked, you know, like live.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, that's a...  Wow.  Wow.  Jesus. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Something to be said about them yoga pants when they're put on the right girls.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, could you find girls that shouldn't be wearing yoga pants?  Put the...  Find those, Sam.  See if you can find some girls that should absolutely not be wearing yoga pants.  There's one classic picture of a black woman that's got to be...  No!  500 pounds in yoga pants.  Really?  Yeah, it's a classic shot I've seen over the years.  What'd you put in the search? 
[03:18:00]  Fat girls, right.  Fat girl yoga pants.  There we go.  There you go.  Oh, come on now.  Yeah, that's the classic one.  That's not real.  Oh!  I've seen that picture a million times.  That's the wide.  Stop it.  Yeah, that's real.  She's got...  She's got to be...  I don't know.  It's three feet wide.  Yeah, 350 pounds.  Easy.  Her ass is a good one yard wide.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  See, that's not quite as sexy as what we were just looking at.  That's like house mom. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  With her flat, fat ass.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's yoga pants.  Looking good.  Looking good.  And it's right with the cheap thrills.  I'm the guy with the cheap thrills that went away.  Mike?  Matt?  Matt in Queensburg.  Oh, Matt.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Matt.  Yeah, I was just thinking of what Ant was saying.  It's so true.  I mean, there's porn everywhere on the internet.  But sometimes you end up spending three hours looking at a page that has girls' underwear 
[03:19:00]  sticking up above the back of their pants or, you know, girls in yoga pants.  You've got porn everywhere, but you spend two hours doing that shit because the cheap  thrills are still pretty good sometimes.  Oh, absolutely.  Something that isn't as blatant.  It's gone away, though.  You just don't get that anymore.  I like the live cheap thrills more than I do, like, seeing it on the internet.  It's like, you know, because on the net, I'm just going to look at nudity and hardcore  pornography.  But in real life, when you're walking around and you catch one of those little moments, 
[03:19:30]  yeah, that's pretty good.  I drove around the block three times when I was going to get my kid at school because  I was driving up the road and there was a girl leaning over into a car window talking  to a guy and she had a miniskirt on.  So I just kept driving around the block to see her ass.  All right.  Look up.  I was too scared to admit this, but if you're going to admit, fuck it.  Oh, you know, I absolutely have followed girls in Manhattan because I saw something.  All right.  That's creepy.  But it's not like I'm going to do anything.  I'm not going to do anything.  No.  But you're like, holy fuck. 
[03:20:00]  That was so good.  Why let it just have the moment pass when the moment can continue for a while?  Give it a good look.  You're right.  You're right.  But if you're just creeps, we can't help it.  Matt, if you're admitting it, fuck it.  I'll admit that too, man.  And we are ghoulish.  Huh?  We are creeps when it comes to that.  I don't think the ladies understand.  I don't want anything from it.  It's just that holy, that was amazing and why I could continue that feeling for a little bit.  But when girls say they don't want to be objects, they don't want to be that, I'm sorry. 
[03:20:30]  You are.  And any guy that says different is either gay, which is, you know, fine.  Nothing wrong with that.  Or they're gay.  I just don't see how a guy can look at a girl and not do an assessment of hotness.  Right.  Immediately.  Immediately.  It doesn't matter.  Sam, try, oh, whaletails.com.  Yeah, I've been there. 
[03:21:00]  That's a good one.  Hey, guys.  Good talking to you.  It's been a while.  Well, I wish I could say the same, sir.  No, you can.  Oh, I can.  All right.  Choose not to, though.  Yes.  All right.  See you, guys.  Hang up.  Thank you, Matt.  I'm sorry.  No, we like Matt, though.  Matt's okay.  Okay.  Let me say hi to Ben in Rhode Island.  Ben.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  How's your tiny little state?  We're doing all right, man.  Slow and steady.  All right.  First off, Project X right up Anthony's alley about the high school party. 
[03:21:30]  A ton of naked girls in that.  Is there anything more furiating?  There's a girl at my gym that has what I think is a ridiculous ass.  She wears yoga pants, but ties the sweatshirt around her ass the whole workout.  Oh, okay.  Know what that's about?  Too many fucking guys that don't know how to take a peek the proper way.  Fucking assholes.  So she gets creeped out.  Ruining a trip.  I still follow her around the gym.  It looks amazing, but you can't tell she hides it the whole workout.  Yeah.  Too many creeps fucking just creeped her out.  You know what you do? 
[03:22:00]  Just go up behind her and pull it up on her and go, ah!  Worth getting banned.  All right, fellas, I'm out.  Banned?  Fucking arrested.  All the naked girls in that.  What happened?  Project X, you said.  Oh, Project X, yeah.  It's just a blog about weird pants.  Oh, okay.  I don't know why people do that.  What?  They give us a lot of times links to things and names to sites, and I click on them sometimes  and look and go, why did you give me this?  Starting today, if you tweet me and say, this is a must-see, I'm not clicking on it. 
[03:22:30]  What's going on?  I've been disappointed too many times with the must-sees that aren't must-sees.  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  It looks like the Watts Riots going on.  Rolling!  I think they're all just going back to the studio.  Who is it, though?  What are they coming in for?  Sway and there's other people.  Coming in for the morning show?  Coming in for the first show of the morning?  Who is that?  Was that the staff?  Was that the staff?  There was a posse.  I think we just saw a posse.  Was that a posse?  All I heard was, so we're going to have some fun this morning. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Let's get the hell out of here before it goes down.  Will they get some heroin?  Heroin.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  What's up in your world there, Roland?  We're about to finish up for today.  Yeah, Roland.  Not much.  The show went fast today.  Yeah.  Fucking zoomed on by.  And I think because Roland really didn't come in much and talk.  Oh.  That makes the day go a little faster.  Kind of the day slows down when you start yapping.  Are you going to Springsteen?  I think so, yes.  Oh, where's my instructions for my Springsteen tickets? 
[03:23:30]  Do I have to go to a secret location like I did for the fucking Paul McCartney tickets?  Why?  I have to go to a hotel.  Same thing.  Go up to like the 19th floor.  I didn't get that.  On the door.  I open up.  There's three people on different computers.  It was like a fucking boiler room operation.  They said you didn't want tickets.  I was going to be whacked.  No, I didn't have to do that for McCartney.  Why did Ann have to do that?  Because I'm on.  I just went, I think.  What?  Did you?  I think so.  You didn't pick your tickets up at that hotel room?  Maybe someone did it for me.  Oh, maybe. 
[03:24:00]  I absolutely didn't go to a hotel room.  I got to go to this hotel.  And go to that floor.  And go to this floor.  What floor?  Oh.  What do I have to ask for?  You're Muggsy?  What is this?  And then you get your Bruce tickets.  And then I get my Bruce tickets.  How are you getting your Bruce tickets?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Do you officially have some?  They say don't worry.  But I don't have one of those.  Can I give my tickets to somebody else?  They say you don't have tickets. 
[03:24:30]  Because you said you want them.  Uptown, motherfucker.  Uptown.  I heard Howard's yelling and screaming he's not going to the Bruce show.  Because he's not happy with how the company's.  Treating them.  I think he said it's for the subscribers.  So he just feels like.  No, he's yelling and screaming about how he's being treated.  He doesn't care about how anyone else is treated.  Nicole, get in here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Now we're going to get to the bottom of this.  We ain't starting no rumors.  I didn't start no rumor. 
[03:25:00]  People are calling.  I didn't start no rumor.  They're Facebooking.  They're tweeting me that my relationship is over.  I'd like to know how I got dragged into this at all.  They're saying they heard it from Opie and Anthony.  And that I like.  And you just assume that we started the rumor?  I'm just saying.  The show.  I didn't start no rumor.  Now the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't care enough to, you know.  I would hope not.  I don't care what happens to you and your husband-to-be.  Ouch.  I hope it breaks up.  I'll tell you the truth.  See, now.  You get a little more, you know. 
[03:25:30]  No, and it was a little more available.  Well, the only reason you hope.  And the only reason.  Yeah.  Because we all know you don't want to be married at this point.  No, that's not true.  That's what the conversation was.  I'm a little nervous, but I think everybody gets nervous.  Oh, Kofi.  We talked about the male attention she desires and that the marriage wasn't going to last.  Not that it was already over, Nicole.  And then someone tweeted me this morning that Opie said that I enjoy chloroform play.  Like, where do you go?  Who listens to your show, dude?  I've never even heard of that.  Did you say that, Opie?  Chloroform play.  Don't lie to me. 
[03:26:00]  Go listen to our entire show.  I wish I came up with something that funny.  That is a good one.  That's funny, man.  She enjoys chloroform play.  Sam, I swear to God.  I can look you in the eyes and tell you I did not do that.  Chloroform play?  I mean, really?  That's really funny.  So I got called this because we don't enrich the other day.  What is chloroform play?  I don't even know.  I don't know, but it sounds exciting.  It does a little bit.  No, but I got called in because the phone lines are being flooded with calls saying that  you guys are saying my relationship was over. 
[03:26:30]  No, June's not over.  And I was calling off the wedding.  It's not a good idea, but it is going to happen.  Sam doesn't think the marriage lasts more than, what, a year?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  I wouldn't wish anybody an ill of their marriage.  I would just wish you wouldn't get married in the first place.  Okay.  I don't wish for that.  That's honest.  That's different.  How old are you?  About.  29.  Oh, yeah.  You should be married.  Do you miss the guys, like, really coming on to you because they know you're getting  married and so they kind of back off a little bit?  No, I mean, I miss the idea of, like, other penises. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  You see what I'm saying, Anthony, here?  That scares me that one penis the rest of my life.  Just like you would be scared.  Weren't you nervous before you got married?  I hope that this is going to be the last one.  Last vagina?  Not the last penis.  If you want the honest answer, no, because I was lucky enough to get married older.  Yeah, that's true.  I think it's crazy, especially a guy getting married young, man.  Plus, you found the right partner.  I love the Kellogg's variety pack of vaginas.  I don't like sticking to, like, I don't like cornflake vaginas.  You're not going to buy a big cereal box.  It's too much commitment.  No, I like the different ones. 
[03:27:30]  Even the Special K when you get a little, you know, there's nothing left.  You know, that one Special K that's left.  I don't care.  What vaginas would be in your variety pack?  Oh, man.  I'd go Asian.  Would you really?  In a variety pack?  Fuck yeah.  Cocoa Pebbles or no?  No Cocoa Pebbles at all.  I'll go with this.  Asian, black.  How many do you get in the variety pack?  He's writing it down.  Six, six, six, six in the variety pack.  I absolutely would not go Juh. 
[03:28:00]  Why?  I wouldn't go Juh in my variety pack now.  Sorry, Nicole.  Wow, that hurts.  You got any Jewish girls?  You're Jewish?  Yeah, I'm a Jew.  Biggins is a Jewish name.  I'm a Jew.  How much Jew?  I'm a full-blown Jew.  You got nice boobs, but that means you got weird nipples then.  I don't have weird nipples.  Prove it.  I will not prove it.  I do not have weird nipples.  Sick.  I'm a Jewish.  There's only way you can prove it through the clothes, maybe.  Why would you not go Juh?  We get rid of the blowjobs.  Oh, man.  I swear.  I've seen some funny Jewish nipples over the years. 
[03:28:30]  Very funny.  I promise they're not weird.  Yeah, right.  They're beautiful.  Are you all Jew?  I'm all Jew, yeah.  And he's Irish Catholic, so this is a lot of people.  Oh, shit.  Sounds like a sitcom.  Small.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,  wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Irish Catholics have small penises?  It's probably one of the biggest penises I've ever had inside me.  Wow.  Wait, wait, she said one of.  Not the biggest.  No.  Oh.  You want me to prove?  Prove it.  There could be a bigger one in your vagina?  What was the biggest one? 
[03:29:00]  I don't want to go there.  Let's not go there.  Black?  Oh, don't say that.  It was black, right?  They don't mind that stereotype, do they now?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, you could get all the way out the door.  Half black and half what?  White.  How big?  It hurt a little bit, my belly.  Oh, man.  I have to go.  That's where he was holding the knife.  Water bottle side?  No.  But listen, the wedding is on, okay?  The wedding is on.  Game on.  Barely.  And I do not enjoy chloroform plays.  I didn't say that.  Whatever that is. 
[03:29:30]  I'm not that funny.  I'm funny, but I'm not that funny.  There she goes.  That's too funny.  The soon to be married.  And soon to be divorced.  Well, no.  Don't say that.  You can't really think that that's going to work out.  She's only getting married because she's turning 30.  It's so obvious.  She's getting that midlife crisis that girls get at 30 when they're like, oh, I got to  be married.  I got to have kids.  Midlife crisis for guys, 50 for girls, 30.  Just keep fucking.  Don't worry about it.  See?  She was like, I'm going to miss the penises.  She's going to have the I want dick crisis at 32.  I want dick.  The I want dick crisis. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I love when girls go through that.  Yeah.  Yep.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that.  Oh, man.  Let's go home.  I'd like to prove it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, OK.  She's a smart one.  Wow.  Look at the time.  Yoga perv instructor.  What's this about?  That's great.  What did we take?  Three breaks today?  Yeah.  You guys actually could have left a while ago.  Yeah.  Are you going to have to edit the show?  Can you go to edit out everything you said?  Why would I? 
[03:30:30]  I don't know.  Can you go to Glenn807 on Twitter?  He gets a big Twitter plug today.  Two N's or one?  Because it says yoga perv instructor.  I want to see what that is.  Go in with one N.  Seems like we were just saying good morning.  Oh.  Oh, what is this?  Good morning.  Well, good morning.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen this guy.  Yeah, this guy.  I've seen this guy.  What the fuck?  I've seen this picture.  There's two girls with little fingers.  Look at the yoga instructor's body. 
[03:31:00]  He's never done yoga in his life.  No.  He's some fat boss.  How do you talk those women into fucking...  Explain the picture.  I'm sorry.  There's a whole gymnasium full of women that are on mats.  Congratulations.  Yoga mats.  They're laying...  Let's say they started laying on their back.  They then flipped their legs over their heads and, you know, kind of put their legs in the  lotus position, it looks like.  So, their asses are sticking straight up in the air.  Then this guy is hovering over them with his hands, one hand on each girl. 
[03:31:30]  His palms right on their taint.  Palms exactly on their taint.  His middle finger pushing, pushing on their vaginas.  You could see it.  Retweet.  Is that real?  I retweet that shit.  That's too good.  I don't know.  You think it could be photoshopped?  That could be photoshopped.  Someone could have put him in there.  He could have been, like, picking up weights.  Look closely.  Do you think he could have been bending down, looking to pick up weights for weightlifting? 
[03:32:00]  I've done a little yoga, man, and you gotta...  You gotta...  What?  You gotta get fingered?  Did you ever have your taint pushed?  By some fat guy?  Let me say, I'm a little suspect because the point where his leg meets...  Where he's behind somebody.  Someone did a good job because they camouflaged it with lighting and shadows.  So, you don't really see...  You don't really see anywhere where he has to be cut into the picture.  I think that's fake. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, I think you might be right.  I think it's fake.  Because he wouldn't be, like, holding two girls.  Unless right after that was snapped, one of the girls pulled a gun out and shot him in the face.  Right.  Because that motherfucker is not appropriate.  And what's he doing?  They look like they're doing it fine.  He's pushing down.  And why isn't he with the other girls?  He's pushing down for what's called full stretch.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I've been in that position.  He's doing knuckle yoga.  You got a full stretch.  Yoga is weird because, like, I don't know, you leave your... 
[03:33:00]  What would the word be?  Vanity, I guess, at the door?  Yeah.  You get into some...  Inhibitions and vanity.  All that shit.  You have to leave that at the door because all of a sudden you're like...  And, like, I've been in a class where all of a sudden they parry up and they need you to touch the girl's upper inner thigh to get her in the right position.  And, like, all of a sudden, like, stuff you would never do to a...  Someone made this shit up just to touch girls inappropriately.  Come on.  But all of a sudden you're like... 
[03:33:30]  You go into these classes and you're a stranger.  Next thing you know you're touching girls that is okay because you're in yoga class.  I don't know.  And that's the only reason it's okay.  Right.  Holy mother of God.  So make fun of the yoga all you want, man.  Yeah.  Between the yoga pants and the inappropriate touching, it's not too bad.  It seems to be.  We do everything today.  I think we did. 
[03:34:00]  We didn't get to the wheeze tapes, so we'll do that tomorrow, man.  Do it tomorrow.  Oh, we did miss something.  What?  Getting the fuck out of here.  Ah!  Oh, shit.  And I miss E-Rock today.  You miss him?  Yeah.  Good.  I'm kidding.  I will guarantee he's back tomorrow.  Feeling fine.  Now you just gave him an excuse to take another day because he'll be like, see?  Hope you said guarantee and I'm not well yet.  Plus, I think that's his little way of getting you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  And we'll see tomorrow if Travis wins $100. 
[03:34:30]  I say this new iPad will absolutely be smaller.  I think I'm going to go with Travis on this one.  Not significantly.  Nothing crazy, but just enough.  Small enough.  This Black Border shit, I'm telling you.  I think since this came out, they figured that out.  Where is that?  Oh, sorry.  And that means then.  It's always an error.  This is why they go smaller.  Because you see all these iPad covers?  Yeah.  Useless with the new iPad.  Oh, shit.  And they're all about trying to get as much money from you as possible. 
[03:35:00]  So now if you get a new iPad, right, you can't use your old iPad cover.  So now they get you for that as well.  $200, Travis.  I'm upping my bet.  Dude, all they really have to do for that is move around.  It's on the table?  I'm upping my bet to $200 instead of the fucking Peyton Manning bet.  Fuck that.  I'm a little nervous about him going to the Dolphins now.  Okay, $200 on the table.  Yeah, because I just figured out that why wouldn't they make it small if they could so that forces you to buy new iPad covers.  All right, Travis.  Riley gets some new clothes.  No, Travis gets a new iPad. 
[03:35:30]  You're going with Travis on this?  Yeah.  I think they're going to be the exact â€“ there's no way they go an exact size.  Yeah, I'm going with Travis, too.  I think so.  If anything, they'll make the screen bigger.  Why change the size when â€“  My fingers were crossed.  Oh, boy.  My fingers were crossed.  The whole thing is that it's going to have an HD display, so if anything, the display would become bigger if they had more room for it.  Oh, really?  Apple's own Sam Roberts?  I don't work for Apple. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, wow.  You sounded very informed.  One could assume that if the display is the â€“  Do you understand what I said?  Could you go to boobcritics.com?  Yeah.  Boob critics?  Yes.  Please.  What's on boobcritics.com?  I know you want to go home.  I understand.  Nice.  What's boob â€“  Oh, man.  That's nice.  Wow, that girl is attractive.  You think?  Fuck.  What are some of our options on boobcritics.com?  What did you think of the second that picture came out? 
[03:36:30]  What did you think of?  Jizzing.  I thought of what it would be like to just take her top off and see those tits.  Yeah, but when a girl's upside down, it's a pain in the neck because, like, you either have to put your head â€“  Not when they're hanging by their feet.  But you have to put your head all the way like this.  Or you have to turn the picture right side up.  But then it still doesn't look right.  And it always messes up your eyes.  She got Sally Ride in the space shuttle hair when they're upside down.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't like that.  So what's boob critics?  Boob critic, I think.  Oh, do you?  No, gravy stains. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, I remember these type of sites.  I need round nipples.  You get to rate the boobs.  It used to be called RateMyBoobs.com.  Yeah.  It was a big one when we were at AF.  So how many stars in it?  On this?  Just because they're big doesn't mean they're good.  I'd give it a four.  Yeah.  Her average is 7.2, though.  Yeah, well, that's because this guy would just go big.  Oh, God, that's a one.  That's two.  That's two, two.  One would be just mastectomy.  Oh, man.  But why don't they tell you the average?  They do.  It's 6.3. 
[03:37:30]  How is that a 6.3?  You desperate fucks out there.  Who the fuck is voting 6.3?  Those are horrid tits.  That's a nine.  She's cute.  Body.  I'll go nine.  What is that one?  No, I'd go eight.  What do you got?  What's the average?  8.7.  All right, we're both in range there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  That's a five.  Fuck it.  Look at that.  7.4 people are giving that.  No.  No, I didn't even give that a five.  Look, one is square.  That is a square tit.  That's all they got so far?  I give that a four.  Oh, God. 
[03:38:00]  That's a four.  I'll go with a four just because they're there.  That's a four tops.  They're too long.  Yeah, big long tits.  All right.  All right.  Now we're talking about an eight.  That's a good solid eight.  What is the average on that one?  8.9.  Yeah, I give that an eight.  Yeah, I give that a seven.  7.7.  Man, whatever.  People are scared to give low scores on the ones that deserve it.  All right.  She's holding them up in a four.  Yeah, and they're already.  That's no more than a five.  I know they're big and they're pierced.  Very five.  Very five.  What's the average on that? 
[03:38:30]  6.6.  Come on.  What is wrong with these people?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Oh, sha!  Two.  That's a two.  What's the average on that?  5.4.  That's a big fat broad.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now we're talking about nine.  Juicy one.  That's a solid nine.  Nah, I'd give that a seven.  What's the average on that?  Whoa.  Yeah, they need to be shaped better.  An eight?  They need a better shape.  The average is nine.  All right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, is that Sandy Kane?  Just pass on that one.  I'm not even fucking giving it.  Pushing them together.  That's a six.  I give it a six, yeah.  I was going to give it a six, a seven, but.  8.8.  Because she tricked them?  Yeah.  Trickery.  Unfortunately, her face is brutal.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like my brother.  My brother with nice tits.  I don't even want to comment on that one. 
[03:39:30]  That's an ugly girl.  Oh, God.  God damn it.  That's fucking.  They look dried out.  They look completely dry.  But they're still big.  Oh, it looks like dog crap that's been in the sun too long.  Looks like she dipped them in, like, I don't know, baby powder or something.  That's a two.  That's a two.  Yeah, tops.  If that bra came off and you saw those tits, you'd be like, ugh, two.  6.0.  No.  They're some desperate idiots.  Those are little and cute.  And nice.  And nice. 
[03:40:00]  They don't have to be big.  I go seven also.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the average?  8.1.  I don't know.  These guys get carried away with themselves, don't they?  These guys vote a little high, I think.  Yes, they do.  Ew.  What is that?  Oh, God.  That's a two.  That is a two.  That's terrible.  Look at the space in between those small boobs.  Yeah.  Two.  Small are fine, but they've got to be the right place.  They've got to be in shape.  Shapely.  Proportion to the body.  What do you got in that?  That one was a six.  That's not a six.  What's wrong with these people? 
[03:40:30]  The sun is making a weird shadow on that one nipple.  That's a seven.  Yeah, that's a good seven.  Wow.  The midsection looks pretty good.  7.5?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That one's pretty good.  How about one more?  We got to go.  One more.  Oh, God.  Now, pass that.  Come on.  Get to a good one.  That's not a good one.  No, no, no.  We'll know when it's good.  We'll know.  Oh.  But arching her back, though.  That's a solid eight.  Those look like the ones from that chick in the rock bus back in A.  All right.  Yeah.  It's an A.  Making a target A. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  In Sharpie A.  It looks great in Sharpie.  All right.  We got to go.  Yeah.  All right.  Fuck this shit.  That was fun.  All right.  Jimmy will be back tomorrow, I think.  Did he film something today?  Yeah, he was doing something for Louie.  I guess some asshole is trying to get Louie in trouble for having some real good comedy  about Sarah Palin and her kid.  What?  The funny kid.  I don't believe you fucking...  Some obsessed asshole out there is trying to make a big deal about it. 
[03:41:30]  Louie's fine.  And thanks to everyone who reported that to me.  Yeah.  We're monitoring the situation.  Don't you worry.  We're always on top of things.  But some guy's trying to make a name for himself.  I don't know.  Good luck with that asshole.  Louie...  Yeah.  Louie did it in comedy.  Ew.  She's a big dick on the screen.  What?  I don't know.  This is a new website.  What is it called?  It is anyone up and it's got pictures of your Facebook and then pictures of the girls nude. 
[03:42:00]  Oh!  I like that.  I like when they're dressed undressed.  I've seen those sites where they show a girl and she's like, you know, totally dressed  and you click on the picture and she's naked.  It's almost like, wow, I undressed her.  You know?  You did.  Yeah.  Apparently I'm getting told by Sally Inter, who's an expert, that there are a lot of dicks  on this page, so be careful.  Oh, he's an expert on dicks?  I guess.  I don't know.  I mean...  I guess he looks at dick websites. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know.  Damn.  Yeah, Sal said this is where he goes to find the dick pictures.  That's where you go for the cock?  Yeah.  We just saw one, so it's there.  We did.  Yeah, yeah.  Good for you, Sal.  Sal.  Hey.  You didn't have to go out for any food today, did you, you fucking crybaby?  Sal, you'll love this picture.  Guy holding his cock.  It's a dick.  It's a big dick right there.  Does he at least have tits?  No, it's just his dick.  It's just a big dick. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, wow.  It's a guy with a dick.  It's a guy and his cock.  It's a dick.  It's a dick.  Sal's all into it.  Oh, he loves it.  Yeah.  Fucking loves his dick.  See, there's a guy.  There's his dick.  Sal.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Sal.  You can't love this.  Sal.  There's a dick here for you.  Oh, we found one for you.  Found some more dick.  I've got a picture of someone.  Is Sal yelling and they won't turn his mic on?  I don't know.  So he can't defend himself?  That's the best.  Sal, check out this.  I don't care about the dick on the website.  It's just, it's like.  Oh, he loves the dick.  Look at this picture of this guy's dick.  Oh, it doesn't look like it's dead.  Sal loves dick.  No, you know how you guys follow I Like Girls and all those sort of things? 
[03:43:30]  You follow I Like Boys?  You follow Dick?  Yeah, I get it.  I like Dick.  I like Dick daily, yeah.  No, you can follow it on Twitter and you just got to be aware of like the name they post.  And, you know, sometimes if it's got a guy's name, you'll see a fucking says it.  You accidentally end up clicking on titty pictures.  Completely, yeah.  And you're all like pissed off.  Where's the dick?  Where's that dick?  I know everyone's trying, but I Like Girls Daily is the best as far as girls and Twitter go.  So, Sal, check this out.  I know there's other sites out there trying.  Fuck you, Sal.  Hey, that's my floor. 
[03:44:00]  My props to I Like Girls doing it perfectly so far.  I'd love to hang out here and, you know, look at more dick pictures like Sal, but.  At least I got something to talk about on the after show.  You sure do.  Dick.  That's right.  All right.  Bye, y'all.  Take it easy.  Bye, see you tomorrow.  Perfect.  Thank you.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live. 
[03:44:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, yes, yes.  And the After Opie and Anthony Live hotline is already ringing.  Looks like Eric Nagel is on the phone.  First of all, Eric Nagel.  Eric is spelled with a K to the phone screener, but unless this Eric Nagel is spelled with a C.  Eric Nagel, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:45:00]  Hello, Sam.  How are you?  Hello, Eric.  How are you?  I'm playing Skyrim, watching The Simpsons, and eating pizza.  How are you?  Oh, is that good for your throat?  It doesn't matter.  Grease is good for everything.  Because I know, Eric Nagel, since this is obviously you, the sex man, E-Rock, who called  out sick today.  You said you had a throat problem, but you said you're just playing game.  You're playing Skyrim while watching The Simpsons while eating pizza.  Yes, in my new home theater at my mansion. 
[03:45:30]  Now, Roland, obviously, this is Roland.  You texted me while the show was still on saying we should get E-Rock for the after show.  Yeah, I realized he was going to pick up the phone, so I said fuck it.  I thought you were the talent booker.  Yeah.  So why don't you book me a guest?  What are you going to do?  Now, Travis, have we tried his BlackBerry and iPhone numbers?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  We've tried both numbers dozens of times.  When was the last time you tried? 
[03:46:00]  Paul, when was the last time you tried calling it?  Probably 10 minutes before the other show.  About 10 minutes.  Yeah, about 20 minutes ago.  Let's give him a call.  I think it's a good idea.  See if he picks up.  And Roland, I mean, this would have been a big get for the show.  Yeah, we're going to do it.  Everybody passed on them.  They already passed on the sex man?  Yeah, they said that we already know about the Prince Nagels, so they just passed.  All right.  Well, you're welcome to come and hang out in the studio.  I'm assuming you're calling from your office right now?  No.  Where are you calling from? 
[03:46:30]  My office.  That's what I thought.  Okay.  You're welcome to come and hang out if you'd like.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Listen to him giggle.  Roland just loves making prank calls.  It is after Opie and Anthony Live.  I was amazed with what came up on the Opie and Anthony show today because people have  just found so many different ways to show nude women on the Internet.  First, we were looking at Yoga Pants websites, and then the website is Anyone Up, which shows 
[03:47:00]  photos.  It shows you the girl's Facebook photo and then also a nude photo of them, which is something  that I find enjoyable.  But what our intern, Sal, I guess, was communicated to me was he likes that website because they  also show some dicks, which, I mean, I guess to each his own.  It's just I didn't know why he had to make himself heard in such a loud way.  But regardless, he had a good time. 
[03:47:30]  What?  You're running in here, Sal.  Because I was told Travis got on my headphones.  He said, Sal said, don't forget to let them know to check out the dicks.  Let me be very clear.  OK.  So, by the way, you've had a gangbusters week so far.  I I'm not.  I like that you're I like that you're being more open on the air these days.  You're telling Kenny to go fuck himself and that you're not going to get any food.  And now you're coming in here to say, yes. 
[03:48:00]  So what?  I'm the one intern who's willing to admit that you like, you know, that you like to look  at pictures of of male genitalia, which is fine.  No, I need to make it.  Which is good.  But we need that kind of we need the difference of opinions here on the Opie Anthony show.  And we need someone who's as confident as you that, you know, you can let us know.  So bravo, Sal.  No, no.  Let me make it very clear.  Like I said, I said to Travis, you have to be careful because you need to be aware of  what they're what the name of the person is when they post on there because it might be 
[03:48:30]  a guy's name and you might see some dick.  And you end up getting excited and embarrassing yourself.  It got lost in translation from, you know, me telling Travis to coming to you that Travis,  how did it come across when Sal told you this?  He said, hey, sometimes this place gets sued by Facebook and there's lots of dicks on it.  So he goes, two reasons to check it out.  I mean, that's how I take it.  It gets sued a lot by Facebook.  Yeah.  Like, no, they've gotten in like major lawsuits.  But they won't take their dumb site down. 
[03:49:00]  No, they won't.  And I figure how the loophole they have.  I mean, it will get shut down eventually.  Sure.  So enjoy it while you can.  And I was on the bus ride this morning.  They found a senator, a senator's niece from New Hampshire.  Like, she's up there.  Like, so this can get like, where do these, you know a lot about this website.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I just have friends who tell me about it and stuff like that.  Jurg off a little bit too?  Yeah.  All my gay friends, we just sit there looking at dick pictures.  That's cool.  How do they get the nude photos then?  Well, it's actually user submitted. 
[03:49:30]  And then what they do is like, it usually is a lot of like ex-boyfriend and girlfriend  sort of thing.  But it's real.  Because I know all the porn websites now.  It's all fake.  Yeah.  Check out my ex-girlfriend.  Oh, no.  What did you do over there, UCB Fred?  Is everything, you know I worry about you so much.  Is everything okay?  I heard a crash.  Is everything okay?  Dandy, Sam.  Everything's dandy?  Good.  I like your stripes today.  Because all the like porno websites now, they go like, check out my ex-girlfriend. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  And we've had the girl in studio before.  You know what I mean?  Like, I know this isn't anybody's ex.  Yeah.  And the comments box, people say, who is she?  And then they just write her name.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They go like, here's her penthouse spread.  Yeah.  You dated a penthouse girl.  That's not as exciting as usual exes.  Yeah.  But these are the real deal.  This is a pretty legit website, and if you're into like, you know.  You're legit in the sense that they get sued by Facebook all the time.  Yeah.  Like, I gotta do some research on it.  But yeah, it's pretty cool.  And so it's user submitted, guys send their exes, or I would assume the dick pics, the 
[03:50:30]  guys probably just send themselves.  Yeah.  And they have this phrase.  Let me make sure I'm putting this correctly.  It's like N-B-H-N-C.  Which stands for what?  No butthole, no care.  So like, if you, they.  Is that that Bob Marley song?  No butthole, no care.  Yeah.  And so that's like a hashtag.  If you just like, look that up on Twitter, you'll see like, a lot of people writing that.  Because like, if girls just send in their tits, you know, people will tweet back, no butthole, 
[03:51:00]  no care.  So like, they want.  I understand.  I understand.  I thought it was to say.  They want more than just the tits.  I thought it was as if to say, I didn't, I get, it means if you're not showing us your  butthole, we couldn't care less.  We couldn't care less, yeah.  I see.  They're taking a strong stance.  How did, how did today go without your leader?  Ah, it was, you know, it was a very gloomy day.  It was.  Yeah.  You didn't know where to go? 
[03:51:30]  I was walking around.  You didn't know what to do.  Actually, I feel like Eric was walking around aimlessly in his mansion saying, Sal's not  here to tell me what to do.  Um, no, it is, it is definitely a different dynamic when Eric is in here.  Productive is the word you're looking for?  No, no, no, no, no, no, don't, no, don't say that.  No, it's just, Sal told me he got a ton of work done today.  How much work did you get done today?  Well, I mean, I was working on this thing for Danny and, uh, Troy was, you know, helping  me out with it and stuff like that.  And it was, it was fun.  It was, it was great.  I love being, you know, without Eric.  No, it's not. 
[03:52:00]  I'm just trying to, I'm trying to figure out what the chemistry is here.  No.  It sounds like Sal has more fun when Eric's on here.  No.  We got a call.  I don't, I don't think that's from Eric.  I think I recognize that phone number.  I get very excited now.  It's, let me pick it up, Sal.  Hotline, you're on the After Open Anthony Live show.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  You have a very informative show.  How is that?  Well, I just learned that Sal told me to go fuck myself.  Well, I was, I was saying that in jest, Kenny. 
[03:52:30]  I hope you, I don't want you to take that out on Sal.  I mean, I meant that as if to say, Sal told, told you to go fuck yourself the same way Sal  announced that he likes looking at dick pictures.  You know, those two were kind of on the same level.  I don't, no, I don't, I don't get it.  You don't understand that?  Kenny, you know I like you.  Well, the problem is, Sal, we talked about this with Kenny before.  He takes facts in, but there is no thought processor.  It's just input. 
[03:53:00]  You know what I mean?  Figuratively speaking, when, when you said that statement.  Right, right, right.  No, Kenny, I, I can, I can assure you that Sal has never literally come to me and said,  hey, if you see Kenny, tell him to go fuck himself.  He hasn't actually said that.  I just meant in reference to the fight that, uh, broke out on Monday here on the show.  There was no fight.  There was, there was a, there was a bit of an argument, I would say.  All right, well, you know, I, I just, I don't, I like people when they talk behind my back. 
[03:53:30]  Well, he didn't, he didn't, I just put the words in his mouth as I tend to do from time to time.  This entire show so far.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, if we're, if we're just going facts here, he, to my knowledge,  doesn't particularly enjoy looking at dick pictures either.  But these are just things that I was saying.  All right, because, you know, I shook the guy's hand.  No, I know, I know, Sal, is everything okay between you and Kenny?  Yeah, I think everything's cool between me and Kenny.  You don't want to tell him to go fuck himself? 
[03:54:00]  Absolutely not.  I mean, like, we just made progress.  Why would I throw it all away for something childish like that?  Last time he got so upset, he almost ran over a horse.  And that's not what I want.  No, no.  I don't, and I don't want to feel like I'm partially responsible for any horse.  Right.  Being run over.  You know, not being.  All right.  All right?  Well, uh, well, you know, I listened to your show for all the news.  What?  I appreciate that.  And to the people who listen to the show for news, they also, of course, listen for  traffic and weather.  Kenny, do you have a report? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, it's terrific.  Here or everywhere?  Wherever you are.  All right.  Well, that's good.  That's good.  Just make the best of it.  Okay.  Wherever.  I wish the forecaster did say that.  The weather forecaster just said, look, wherever you are, it's going to be all right.  Just make the best of it today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Now, there's a lot of people that are a lot worse off.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, there's got to be somebody who's the worst. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  I just hope it's not me.  I don't think it is.  Oh, people, like, all around telling me to go, fuck myself.  That's true, Sal.  Why did you say that?  I did not say that.  You didn't.  Okay.  So that would explain it.  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you later, Kenny.  All right.  Have a good show, Sam.  Hey, find Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Oh, thanks, Sam.  Thanks for that mention.  You got it.  Hey, you want to talk some more about pussycats? 
[03:55:30]  No, but I had a good time telling cat stories on the show today.  I was disgusted by it because I learned something else.  What did you learn?  Your girlfriend has a filthy mouth.  Well, Jess, my fiance does when she gets frustrated, when she's at one, you know, she's more emotional  than usual.  She will be profane with her language.  Ugh.  And she has called the cat, Bruiser Brody, she has called him a fucking asshole before. 
[03:56:00]  I don't know, Sam.  I know.  I know you don't like that because you're more of a traditional guy.  But, you know, you got to realize it's 2012.  You know, females have been empowered.  Women's lib has passed.  And females can now kind of curse a little more.  You know what I mean?  Well, if you're into that sort of thing.  Well, Kenny, I mean, she doesn't have the potty mouth that you do, but, you know, she's  a human being.  Oh, no, I love to curse, but I'm not her. 
[03:56:30]  But I'm starting to learn more, like, she's the dominant, you're the submissive one.  That's not true at all.  No, I get it.  All right.  Well, Kenny, thank you so much for calling in.  Yeah, I get it.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  I'm going to the Lincoln Tunnel soon in case anybody, you know, is concerned.  All right.  Kenny will be doing a signing in the Lincoln Tunnel in about three minutes.  So if you're in the Lincoln Tunnel, make sure you stop and say hi.  All right. 
[03:57:00]  Hey, Sam, what are you doing for the rest of the day?  Well, I'll probably do this show and then we'll see what happens.  Hey, what do you think about the Nicole Diggums breakup?  Well, I don't think, no.  This is what I was saying.  Nicole from the morning mashup is not broken up with her husband or her fiance.  The marriage is not off.  And I think the marriage will happen.  However, I have no doubt that the marriage won't last.  And I mean, just any time a girl says, and she said this on the air today, any time a girl says, 
[03:57:30]  I'm a little nervous about getting married because of all the penis I won't have in my life,  that girl's not ready for marriage.  You know what I mean?  She needs miles of cock.  Would you be the man to supply that?  I'm happily married myself.  So you know the difference between somebody who's not ready and somebody who is ready to live that happy, monogamous lifestyle. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, I mean, I'm committed.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm committed soon, too, right?  I will be.  And I don't, I'm okay.  I'm not nervous about getting married.  I've been with Jess for six or seven years at this point.  It's about time.  And I'm not, I'm not worried about it.  So.  She's a dom and you're the submissive.  All right.  Goodbye, Kenny.  I'm going to talk to Troy.  He stopped by.  Wait, wait.  Let me talk to Troy.  He's got a new mixtape.  All right.  I'll talk to him about it.  All right. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  Kenny, I don't want to have, I don't want to hang up on you.  I don't want to be rude.  Wait, is Troy in the studio?  Hey, Kenny.  All right, Troy.  How's a new mixtape?  It's great.  I was going to talk to you.  Kenny, I'll talk to you later.  When?  When later?  Tomorrow morning, I think, will be the time.  What time?  About six or so.  Okay.  Thanks.  All right.  Goodbye.  Bye.  I'm glad he had that all settled out and everything. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  Danny just ran down here, and last time he ran into the studio, Travis was making fun of  him in my headphones because he was out of breath.  Yeah, just like I am now.  What's going on?  Oh, nothing.  I was just going to hang the phone up.  Oh, because you're tired of hearing him.  Honestly, yeah.  It's enough already.  Yeah.  I don't want to hang up on the guy.  It's a rude thing to do, you know, but he doesn't like Troy.  It just goes on and on.  Like, I get it.  It goes on.  You're sitting here trying to talk, right, Troy? 
[03:59:30]  Right.  Well, I'm just looking at the clock like, wow, how much longer is this going to go on  for?  Yeah.  And Danny, even you listening.  I was in the back.  I was losing my mind.  It's a frustrating thing.  Yeah.  Imagine me.  Like, the other day, I was just like, how's Roland?  Uh-huh.  And how's this?  And it's just like, I get it if we get somewhere.  But it doesn't go anywhere.  But it doesn't go anywhere.  That's the whole thing.  But why don't you just say to him, all right, hey, thanks for the call, Kenny.  I'll talk to you later.  And then hang up and move on.  Because I don't want to upset the guy.  Well, you won't upset him.  Just say, look, I got to keep the show moving.  I won't upset him if I hang up on him? 
[04:00:00]  Look, then you just say, look.  How many times did I say, all right, I'll talk to you later?  I've said those words.  But he goes this.  He says this.  Well, just say, we're going to move on.  Thank you, Kenny.  Talk to you later.  I said that.  Yeah, but then once you hang up, you're moving along the show.  You're the host.  You think I do?  It's hard to do to Kenny.  You're kind of like Kenny Pussy Whipped.  Is that how it's coming across?  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  You're coming across like a bit of a pussy.  You're Pussy Whipped.  Like, handle the situation.  You're the host of the show, right? 
[04:00:30]  Well, just handle it.  Like, does Opie just sit there and hang on people?  No.  Exactly.  He hangs up on people.  Exactly.  Let me do my Sam impression.  You ready?  You got it.  Yes, dear.  Oh, that's what I sound like?  A little bit.  Troy, you say, hey, I'm going to talk on the radio.  Yeah, I'm going to talk on the radio.  Yes, dear.  Oh, and it's my show.  I'm the one who should be controlling.  You're kind of coming across like a little bit of an ass.  And he just said I was the dom.  I was the submissive.  Exactly.  He's dominating.  That's his phone number.  Just don't pick it up.  Well, let's talk about something else and move on.  And you just can't just jump in at any time. 
[04:01:00]  Should I pick it up?  No.  Troy, you're saying I shouldn't pick it up.  I'm telling you, you might as well finish out the show.  You're not going to be able to talk about anything else.  You're just going to have to talk about nonsense.  I love Kenny.  Can I just see what he wanted?  Go ahead.  All right.  Just checking what he wanted.  Kenny.  Hey, Sam, Troy's right.  What?  He's right.  All right, we're moving on, Kenny.  How is that?  I hung up on it.  How is that?  I hung up right away.  You made a great point.  But now, that's a little better, right? 
[04:01:30]  It's a little better.  Let's see if you stick with it.  Okay, because he'll probably call back soon.  Because, and just because he's calling doesn't mean you have to, like, screech the show to  a halt.  But that's what happens when the hotline.  Well, then let the call screener in the back answer the phone call, tell you who it is,  and then you decide if you want to take the call or not.  Because if you're talking about something else, you're going to derail the whole conversation  to talk to Kenny about nothing?  Do you think Kenny tends to derail conversations?  Yes.  He does a lot, right?  And he knows he does.  I'm not telling him something he doesn't know.  He does it on purpose.  Of course he does.  He starts bringing bullshit up. 
[04:02:00]  And he just wants to see how long you get strong along.  He doesn't realize there's an audience.  He doesn't care that there's an audience.  He doesn't care.  Maybe he knows, but he just could give a shit.  And this frustrated you to the point that you were like, listen, I have the ability  to walk into that studio.  If the line was still hot, I was pressing the button.  You would have pressed the button.  I was just going to hang the fuck up and just say, move on.  Maybe I need...  This show and even the show before it, I mean, we all call ourselves producers.  There's no production here.  No.  It's just willy-nilly, do-whatever-you-want type of shit.  Maybe...  And that was an executive decision I was about to make because I just fucking had enough. 
[04:02:30]  Maybe I need an enforcer, like Danny Ross.  Oh, there you go.  Somebody's got to step up to the fucking plate.  Everybody, everybody...  Don't be sorry.  Everything's always great and everything's thumbs up, up high in the air.  Sometimes you put the thumbs down.  No, he made a decision and you have to respect that.  Why couldn't you hang up the phone, Troy?  Because it's your...  I don't want to step into your world, it's your thing, but Danny wanted to come in here  and handle it and that's fine.  I'm glad he did.  Yeah.  I just think you need to grow a set.  I didn't realize it was coming off that way.  A little bit.  Because I don't think... 
[04:03:00]  I thought people didn't like when you're mean to Kenny and, you know, you don't want  to...  He's a beloved figure.  You don't have to be like Kenny, you fucking asshole.  Right.  You just go, hey, Kenny, we're gonna...  Thanks a lot.  I'll talk to you later.  And then we move on to the next day.  Yeah.  Yeah, and people on the feedback are saying, you know, keep him off the air and stuff  like that.  So, Kenny...  Yeah, there's just no reason to constantly derail whatever is going on for Kenny.  Is that why you had come in here?  No, they're working on my studio, so...  So you just came in to hang out.  Um, we only got a couple minutes left because of...  Right.  Exactly.  Because of Kenny. 
[04:03:30]  Exactly.  But, uh, you think Eric will be back tomorrow?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah, he'll come back.  He'll, uh...  And he'll be like, I was sick, and he'll, uh, have some excuse.  He's always sick, too.  I don't know how somebody's always that sick.  Now, here's the thing is that when Eric does come back, he'll, he'll freely admit.  He'll be like, no, I wasn't sick.  Um, well, actually, they're filming, uh, Cribs AMTV at Eric's house right now.  Oh, because he's got the mansion?  Well, I just want to see him.  That's pretty nice.  Um, Travis, do you think he'll be back tomorrow?  Eric?  Yeah.  I could really see it going, going either way, but, but I don't think he likes to stay 
[04:04:00]  away from, from this place more than one day.  I don't think so.  Do you think he'll be back on, do you think he'll be in on Friday?  Yes.  Do I think he'll be in on Friday?  No.  Why not?  I just don't think he'll be in on Friday.  I don't think he'll be in on Friday because of, um, we have DeRosa coming in.  He likes to be here with DeRosa.  What?  He does?  Yes.  That's weird.  Um, I say not tomorrow.  I mean, outside of the show, what else does he really have going on?  Video games.  He's got a mansion and a couch.  I mean, that's it.  That's it.  Simpsons stuff.  Um, well, listen, tomorrow we find out not only if E-Rock comes back, but if Travis is 
[04:04:30]  up 200 and I think he made a pretty safe bet.  Obi bet that the new iPad that they're going to announce today would be smaller.  Then the current one, uh, Travis said, no way, my friend, $200 on the table.  Let's see who takes it home.  Travis, you're still confident.  Absolutely.  And I'll, I'll give him $200 if I'm wrong, but I don't think I'm going to be wrong.  I can't wait to see what happens.  That'll all be tomorrow.  Stay tuned because still today is the Ron and Fed show. 
[04:05:00]  We'll see you.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey. </pre>
