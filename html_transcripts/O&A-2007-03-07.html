<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion of their disappointing Boston ratings, contrasting them with their strong performance in New York and Chicago.  They mused about the reasons for the decline, suggesting the antiquated ratings system and the increasing popularity of iPods as possible contributing factors. A caller, Bondo, theorized that their criticism of Boston's mayor and Democratic politicians might be a cause, but Opie and Anthony dismissed this as unlikely. This transitioned into "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a segment focusing on humorous fantasies involving attractive women, further fueled by a discussion about listener demographics and iPod usage.

The show took an unexpected turn when a powerful smell emanating from Jimmy's bowel movements, a result of oyster consumption, overwhelmed the studio. This caused several staff members to become ill and leave, leading to a chaotic and comedic segment filled with bathroom breaks and descriptions of the pervasive stench.  The hosts then discussed a news story about an Iraqi national who triggered a security scare at LAX due to a magnet concealed in his rectum, speculating about the man's motivations.

The show featured numerous phone calls.  One early call was from a woman who had previously participated in a "booby day" segment but declined this time due to concerns about online broadcast and pressure from a male friend, whom the hosts disparaged as a "C-blocking" "phony guy friend."  Other calls included Jacob Jen, who also expressed concerns about online broadcast regarding "booby day," and Lisa from West Palm Beach, who offered largely irrelevant information about the Iraqi man's story.  There were also calls about a girlfriend's bad breath, and a segment mocking a rival radio show, Eric and Kathy, using a listener-submitted edited version.  Two 11-year-old callers, Seth and Aaron, were interviewed, with suggestive questions posed to Seth about his mother and Aaron admitting to faking illness to skip school.  The segment also included discussions of a YouTube video of young children smoking marijuana and a *Dirty Dancing* wedding lift recreation video.  Throughout this, Jimmy Norton remained present in the studio.

A significant portion involved a "snooping" game with underage callers describing items found in their parents' bedrooms; Emily (14, Canada) found pills and lingerie, and Alex (Florida) found his father's drawings and a poem. Liz (19, New Jersey) described finding lingerie, Vagisil, and suspected butt beads, also mentioning her father's violent tendencies.  She later dangled the butt beads in her sleeping brother’s face.

H-Cup Jane and her husband then joined the show in studio.  H-Cup Jane detailed her breast augmentation journey and her ongoing desire for larger breasts.  They openly discussed their lifestyle as swingers, sharing their experiences, attitudes toward jealousy, and sexual preferences.  Numerous callers shared their own experiences with swinging, ranging from positive to negative and awkward. One caller described providing security for swinger parties in exchange for sexual favors. The show also featured a live, on-air sexual encounter between H-Cup Jane and “the dude,” with commentary from the hosts and interactions with Paltalk viewers. The act was described in detail.  The discussion continued to involve the couple’s relationship, family dynamics, a listener’s suicide attempt and played audio of a reporter confronting a convicted pedophile.  Jim Norton participated in many of these discussions.

The show concluded with further discussion of the Boston ratings, promotion of Opie's upcoming stand-up shows, a "Whip Em Out Wednesday" car sticker contest, and anticipation (and eventual disappointment) regarding the delayed arrival of H-Cup Jane for the "booby day" segment.  BTM called in to explain their inability to attend due to illness.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anthony, XM202.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  No!  No!  I'm stumped, I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony, am I?  Jesus, we are just whores.  Jane Gordon.  Look at his face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  Ugh.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Die.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, I thought I'd start it myself.  With my mouth.  Do, do, do.  Hi, everyone.  Good morning.  Oh, this wonderful Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Oh, wait, we gotta be a little softer.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It's time to wake up.  Here in the Northeast, you could whip them out and they'll just freeze and fall off.  Yeah, we got a cold day in New York.  Hey, we've been waking up horrific people.  And I think it's disturbing some people out there.  Can we wake up the really, really hot chicks today?  Hot chicks.  Yesterday we woke up some guys that are going to sever the head of a human being. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Disembowel people, decapitate, bury torsos, things like that.  Today I want to wake up the really, really hot girls.  Okay, right now the alarm went off.  Yeah.  And so she, what, stretches to shut the, or hit the snooze alarm?  Oh, yeah.  Stretching and breathing.  Her boobies are just heaving.  There she is. 
[00:02:00]  It might be in a, in a oversized t-shirt.  No bra.  What about peonies?  Little peonies.  Little peonies.  They got the heat on in their room.  Nice sheets.  Big, huge, fluffy comforter.  Nice pillow.  Their hair is like in a rat's nest, but you still know they're hot.  Just drooling.  Oh, they got the bad breath and all, but.  But this is radio.  We don't have to deal with that. 
[00:02:30]  You have to deal with that.  Yeah.  That's more of a pleasant wake up.  Yeah.  Than the serial killer.  The girl just kind of stumbling toward the, uh, the alarm clock.  Maybe there's an oopsie going on, but no one's in the room to see it.  No one's there.  Oh, and then she realizes and she has to readjust her, uh, her panties a little bit.  Because her hiney's sticking out.  Yeah.  As she's walking to the bathroom, her hiney is sticking out.  Her little hiney.  Now she's rubbing her eyes and her boobs are just bouncing. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That's who we're waking up today.  Yeah.  We got to bring it back to normalcy.  We have to picture our listeners.  We pictured some really horrific ones.  Well, if you want to picture, uh, the listeners, Anthony, picture them picking up their stupid  iPod and going to work.  Apparently.  That's where our listeners are.  Picking up their iPod.  Oh, God.  Do I hate iPods at this point?  I really do.  Every day we walk from this, uh, studio to the other studio.  And all you see is guys and girls that should be listening to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Just, just listening to their iPods.  With their earbuds.  They're listening to a jukebox.  They're listening to their choice of music.  They're listening to what they think a radio station should be.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  Damn.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's a little frustrating.  Yeah, well.  We should just start pulling them out of their ears and go, listen to me.  Yeah.  Like on the street, live.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Listen to me.  Yeah, we should have a day where you just leave the iPod at home and you listen to the  radio show.  Good luck with that.  Oh, stupid Boston.  God, do we hate you today.  Ugh.  Boston.  I didn't even sleep last night.  The, uh, the ratings, uh, are coming in.  The trends.  Yeah.  And this is what our life is, uh, all about.  Uh, the trends come in for, for, uh, Chicago and New York.  And we have uptrends.  Very, very nice uptrends. 
[00:04:30]  Yep.  Feeling really good about ourselves.  Oh, feeling good.  Finally clicking.  Then, uh, the trend comes in for Detroit.  Still nothing going on there.  They moved us over to an FM and it's still, it's still, uh, it's still a little early.  Yeah.  A little early.  I mean, we should start making some noise in Detroit if we're going to be honest with  each other, but it's still not happening, but it should happen soon.  And then, uh, and then Boston comes in and it's just a complete and utter disaster. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Beyond the point of just, like.  Of epic proportions.  Yeah.  It's beyond the point of just, like, oh, I guess, you know, some people didn't like the  show and tuned out.  I did a little math.  If, uh, my math is right.  In one month, Boston decided, 90% of the audience in a particular demo decided, nah, don't like  these guys anymore.  Nah.  I liked them.  I liked them.  I liked them a lot a month ago, but, uh, nah.  Nah.  Nothing changes by 90% in one month. 
[00:05:30]  That's what drives me nuts as we do this stupid radio show and have to deal with these ratings.  Nothing changes.  Yeah.  People aren't that passionate, uh, about a radio show.  We got our faithful listeners and they're passionate and they make sure they check us  out on a regular basis.  But in general, we're as, as important.  I was telling Anthony as a toaster, we really are just an appliance around the house.  Just imagine going to your toaster and your toaster has been, uh, reliable and making 
[00:06:00]  you laugh.  Uh, no, but your toaster's there and it's reliable.  You love your toaster.  And you use it, uh, you know, every day for a month.  Loving your toaster.  And then out of nowhere, you're going to go, I hate my toaster.  And you go, first of the month, you go, ah, stupid toaster.  I hate it.  And you're going to throw it out.  That's basically what happened to us in Boston.  Yeah.  And I'm not trying to make excuses because, uh, good old Mantown, the, uh, the only show  we really want to, you know, uh, uh, uh, beat, they had a horrific, horrific month too. 
[00:06:30]  They lost like half their audience.  And they lost half their audience.  So, so these, this, the stupid ratings, it's, it's, it's unbelievable.  People don't change their opinion that quickly in a month.  No, now we're radio.  And the ratings, they continue to come out month after month and they don't do anything  about this to, you know, to try to figure out how to make it more stable because people  are, are depending on this crap for their livelihood.  Yeah.  It's just an archaic system.  I look at this email.  I'm like, this can, this is impossible. 
[00:07:00]  We couldn't do this bad if we tried, if we went on the air every day and just like,  like, uh, farted or just, uh, I don't know.  Okay.  I don't know what we did or, or just ate.  So how about we just ate?  All right.  Do that too.  But just ate for three straight hours.  Oh, just every morning.  That's all we did.  We still wouldn't get a ratings as bad as we did in Boston yesterday.  It's ridiculous.  And then they tell us around here and up there and everywhere else.  Don't talk about them.  Don't talk about them.  You got to talk about them. 
[00:07:30]  You know, this show, we, uh, we, we, we talk about the stuff that bothers us.  And, uh, yesterday it was just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Like I said, one of the demos, all of a sudden in one month, 90% of those people said, nah,  don't like these guys.  And I'm, I'm sorry.  It's impossible.  It's absolutely impossible that, you know, you don't have that much passion for this show  where all of a sudden 90% of that demo is going to all at once say, no, we would have  to kill somebody.  We would have to turn into the most horrific human beings in a 30, in a 30 day period for 
[00:08:00]  that to happen.  And we're like, oh my God, I love these guys, but they found what on whose computer?  I can't, I can't be associated with this anymore.  Maybe then.  Yes.  You would, you would have the entire demo, uh, you know, turning their backs on you.  Yeah.  But you know, we're, we're doing really, really good radio.  It's getting better every day.  It just, it just doesn't make sense.  And then, and, uh, we're, you know, I personally am really frustrated today.  Really.  It's very frustrating to see that. 
[00:08:30]  And in all fairness, like it, in New York, the ratings in, in some of these demos went  way up.  So, so what do you do?  Because I know what people are going to now call and say, stop bitching, you know, the  show sucks, blah, blah, blah.  Then how do you explain in New York, the ratings go way up?  Meaning like, I don't have, I didn't do the math on, on the New York numbers, but also  I'm like 50, let's say it's close probably to 50 or 6% of the people in certain demos all  sudden like the show.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  They're all on board.  Like we, the audience grew 50 or 60% in one month.  It just doesn't happen that way.  So we'll acknowledge that too.  It either goes way up or way down in one month's period.  Oh, cause in, in another month, like next month and next month, Boston could be like through  the roof.  All of a sudden, all those people that like, Hey, we love the toaster again.  If we would, if we would take the ratings that came out seriously for Boston, we're basically  not talking.  We're probably talking to 10 people in this particular demo. 
[00:09:30]  That is really important to us.  Literally.  Yeah.  And 10 people.  I can, I can take 10 phone calls right now and prove that the ratings are wrong.  Yeah.  And, and, and, and it jumps up as badly as it jumps down.  So it's not about having bad ratings in Boston.  It's like this system is archaic and it doesn't work anymore.  Obviously you can't have, you can't have a show go through the roof in one month.  Like all of a sudden everyone's on board.  And then the next month, boom, everyone just leaves the show.  So it doesn't work like that on a month to month basis. 
[00:10:00]  You know, you want to see, you know, uh, the show slowly grow.  That seems a little more, that makes a little more sense because you know, you like the show.  Then you turn, turn on, uh, some people maybe you work with onto the show or maybe some friends  and then they get hooked and then maybe they turn in turn, you know, turn some new people  on.  So when you see a slow growth, that kind of makes sense.  It's just kind of growing.  That's why we call the show the O and a virus.  It's kind of like a virus.  It's just slowly growing.  And then eventually you look back and, and, and you see what you've done. 
[00:10:30]  Like, wow, look at this man.  Yeah.  We've got a huge audience now, but to have it go, whoa.  Oh, we love you.  Boom.  We hate you in 30 days.  It's so ridiculous.  We're not listening.  Right.  It's so ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I know we're talking to a lot of people in Boston, but according to yesterday's news,  they say we're not.  They're pretty much saying, uh, you know,  there's college stations beating us pretty much. 
[00:11:00]  Yep.  So anyway, we had to start the show by just bitching a little bit.  It's, it's just unbelievable.  And I, I do blame the iPods.  I do blame the iPods.  There's a lot of people turning their backs on a regular radio.  Thanks to the, the, the invention of the iPod.  Technology.  Yeah.  Technology.  You know, I was reading it.  I was reading a little thing about, uh, you know, uh, younger, younger people and, and, 
[00:11:30]  and what radio means to them yesterday.  Cause I, you know, and knows I'm like a student of this, of this, of this crap.  And they were saying that, uh, you know, kids, uh, and I'm talking about kids that are younger  than the ones we're even trying to, you know, get to listen to our show.  They look at radio, like it's archaic, like it's a antique, like it's like it, it, it,  it has no use for them in their lives because like, and they'd made an example, like, let's  say you were 10 years old in 97.  So now you're, you're around 20 years old in that period, you've had Napster and the 
[00:12:00]  MP3 players are starting to come out and, and the internet was starting to get much better.  So radio to them is like something their parents listened to.  It's like, it's not for me.  Like I have to sit through commercials and I have to like, listen to what they're playing.  Like to them, they don't understand that concept whatsoever, you know, because they've had  it a different way.  They've been getting their music a different way.  Well, there are different incarnations of radio over the years.  So who the hell knows what the next one is? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Years ago, you know, they used to do radio dramas.  There were people, hello, I'm home.  And then they walk in and then TV came around and people like, why am I going to  listen to this crap?  Yeah.  When I can watch people, you know, on TV or, or in the movies or whatever, whatever it  is, whatever came out.  And you know, those radio dramas, they were getting like 60 shares.  Oh yeah.  People loved them.  And now, hello dear.  And now if a radio show gets like a five share, you're really happy.  Yeah.  But back in the day, you were getting like 60 shares for your radio program. 
[00:13:00]  But no one would listen to that now, obviously.  No.  There are other mediums that, that you'd, you'd listen to or you'd watch, uh, that  better convey the story you're trying to tell than, uh, just, uh, over the radio.  But radio adapted in some way and kind of figured out what to do to, uh, combat, uh, television.  Yeah.  Well, that's what a lot of people are saying that radio will adjust once again.  And we'll, we'll have to wait and see.  We need the next step so we could get it like on it now. 
[00:13:30]  It's just a strange time for radio, especially for, uh, for, for the younger people out there.  You know, how do you make it interesting for them again?  You know, cause when we were younger, that's all we had.  So radio was, uh, was everything.  You had your favorite station and you listened to all the time.  That's how you were getting your, your info, maybe some jokes and, uh, definitely some music.  I have a plug in my, uh, in my Mustang that my iPod plugs right into.  Oh, cool.  And it comes out over the radio. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  So I could just tune it in.  There you go.  I don't even have to listen to anything.  Right.  Satellite, regular radio, anything.  I got an iPod so I could listen to whatever the hell I want.  Right.  We ought to start using younger, hipper words.  That's the problem with us.  Ah.  Is we don't say things that the kids are saying like, uh, hey daddy-o.  You know whatever it is.  That's, that's, uh, sound is groovy.  Hey man, this is a rad show.  You know, whatever it is the kids are saying.  That might work. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, let's go to Bondo in New York.  Bondo.  Hey, what's up guys?  What's up, Bondo?  Yo, listen, I think I know what happened in Boston.  Yeah.  Well, I believe that you alienated the entire city.  You bashed their mayor for God knows how long.  But Boston hates their mayor.  Yeah, they don't like me, you know.  We, we lived up there enough to know that we weren't, uh, taking a chance by making fun  of Mayor Menino.  Well, you didn't stop there, did you?  You proceeded to bash every Democratic person in the entire Newfoundland coast. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, but the people aren't going to tune out.  You're talking about politicians.  Our listeners are not going to tune out just because we're bashing politicians.  Why would they?  They don't care.  But Boston is the epicenter of Democratic...  Oh my God.  Yeah, we bashed both, though.  Bondo.  Jesus.  Norton has pretty much said on the air that he's thinking about voting Democrat for the  first time in his life.  Or voting for the first time in my life.  Well, yeah, there you go.  Instead of just shouting at the polls as I drive by and hoping someone listens.  I don't think...  Did you pull that lever for me?  I don't think anyone is praising the Republicans at this point in time.  Even, even hardcore Republicans out there are like, oh God. 
[00:15:30]  Well, listen, Opie, listen, you've used these ratings before as sort of a shield to defend  your position, and today, you know, these ratings are being used as a weapon against  you.  Ah, Bondo, you don't get it.  Do you understand that you cannot lose 90% of your audience in 30 days?  If we gained, if we gained 90%, we would go, uh-oh, something's wrong.  Well, we basically said that because we gained a lot in New York. 
[00:16:00]  So it, it, it never swings either positive or negative as drastically as we're seeing.  It should be a slow build.  That's why, that's why I added the New York numbers saying, look, I'm not using this to  say that, uh, you know, something's wrong with the radio show.  We dropped almost 90% in a, in a certain demo in Boston, but in New York, we went up  like 50 or 60%.  It just doesn't work that way.  Well, then that's just a testament to the inaccuracy of those numbers.  That's what I'm trying to say, and, but we have to, but Bondo, you're going to your 
[00:16:30]  job.  It doesn't mean crap to you.  In, in our lives, it means everything.  And it's really frustrating that we have to live like this.  Hey, listen, I dodged trains for a living.  Give me a break.  All right.  I just didn't like the way you said, and now it's being used as a weapon against you.  Against you.  You are a little too valiant there.  Now I am the master.  And when you take it down a notch, as they say in Chicago.  Very good.  Yeah, speaking of Chicago, we got more Eric and Kathy.  The listeners are on board with the Eric and Kathy thing. 
[00:17:00]  I guess we'll just talk about Chicago because they love us this month.  We love Chicago.  I guess as we move forward, like the, the cities that don't love us because of the rating  system, I, and I am openly blaming the rating system.  Absolutely.  So Detroit and Boston hate us this month, but this month, New York and Chicago loves us.  Yep.  Next month, it'll be, uh, who knows?  Who knows?  And Philly, they have a whole new rating system that no one can figure out.  That's why we haven't even talked about the ratings down there.  Yeah.  What the hell?  We were supposed to like get those.  We got something, but we don't know what it is. 
[00:17:30]  What do you mean?  We don't know.  Because they have a whole new way of doing things.  They said you have paper and it has either a smiley face or a frowny face on it.  And that's how you're doing it.  Hey, we're smiley face.  Because people are emailing me going, what about Philly?  Guess what?  The Philly ratings came in about a week or a week and a half ago.  No one knows how to read them.  And all the radio companies aren't on, some of the radio companies aren't even on board  with the new system.  So, so the ratings that are.  So who do you have it to compare it to?  Right.  So the ratings they're showing you doesn't, uh, uh, have the, uh, the other stations that 
[00:18:00]  didn't sign up for the new service.  It's just a complete mess.  That's why we haven't talked about Philly's ratings this time around.  Because no one knows how to read it.  And this is our livelihood.  This is our livelihood.  You live and die by this crap.  At least they went with some kind of like, I think it's called a people's meter or something  like that.  Some kind of electronic device.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because like, uh, you know, Arbitron, it's like you have to fill out, well, I don't even 
[00:18:30]  know what you're allowed to say about it, but it's very, it's very archaic.  Let's just put it that way.  Extremely archaic.  So they're trying to update, uh, how they, uh, get the ratings and they kind of, they  started in Philly, but no one knows how to read them.  Uh, the clear channel, uh, uh, stations didn't want to be part of that.  So they didn't sign up for it.  And the old school way is now gone.  And so they just threw these ratings at everyone like, well, this is the best we could do.  So I guess you guys got to figure it out.  Yeah.  Figure it out yourselves. 
[00:19:00]  So, uh, no one else is saying it.  So I guess, uh, I guess we could say we're number one in Philly because no one is going  to say we're not.  Cause no one can figure it out.  We're, we're number one in, uh, in Philly.  Thanks Philly.  We love you.  I read the ratings and that's what I got out of them.  Someone else might get something else.  It is just so ridiculous.  Well, I've been saying that men 18 plus is not the demo we should be shooting for.  It's persons 15 to 17 and then women over 60.  That's our core. 
[00:19:30]  That's what we're going to be gunning for now.  We want, uh, to pin undergarments and bubble gum.  We want women with braces.  That's what, uh, we're shooting for.  That's right.  On their legs.  So they can't run.  Nothing.  Oh, we've heard a polio joke.  Yeah.  It wasn't even a polite acknowledgement that a person had talked.  Fonzie.  Fonzie.  Hey.  What's up, Fonzie?  What's happening, guys?  How are you, bro?  Hey.  What's going on?  Uh, not much.  I have a little theory about the Boston ratings being down. 
[00:20:00]  I already know what happened, too, but go ahead.  Go ahead.  Is it the light bright, you think?  Maybe because you bashed us a little?  No.  All right.  Listen.  So you're, uh, in Boston.  You heard us beating you up because of the light bright scare.  Uh, you kind of bashed us a little bit.  Yes.  Yeah, but I think you guys could appreciate the honesty that the rest of, uh, the country  was kind of laughing at you guys for, uh, just overreacting.  Dude, you're the only...  You're still listening to the show.  You got over it.  Well, you guys make me laugh.  You guys are piss-a.  Ah, see? 
[00:20:30]  I say we're wicked piss-a.  Wicked piss-a.  Yeah.  Right.  And, uh, what about Menino?  Mumbles.  Mumbles Menino.  No one likes him.  Maybe he, uh, he's got a friend.  Yeah.  That means he's meeting in a dark back room somewhere.  Right.  His neighbor is Pete Arbitron.  Right.  Can you imagine?  Pete Arbitron.  I work in Boston and nobody likes him here.  I know, because that other caller was stupid.  We learned that lesson a long time ago.  Yeah, I mean, we love you guys up here. 
[00:21:00]  You guys are definitely piss-a.  So keep up the good work, guys.  Yeah, I mean, we'll just keep plugging away with our show.  I mean, I'm not trying to sit here and make an excuse.  What I am saying is we're frustrated at how inaccurate this whole thing is.  Yeah.  That's the headline.  Because everyone will now take what we said, spin it, and throw it on websites.  No.  The headline is we're frustrated by the inaccuracies of the rating system.  They go way up one month.  They go way down the next month.  And radio and listening habits don't change that drastically in a 30-day period. 
[00:21:30]  They don't.  You know, we don't take ourselves seriously.  Where is it as important as your stupid toaster?  We know that.  We're an appliance in your house.  You turn us on every day like you might be making a little toast.  That's all.  That's all.  And you might listen a little longer if we're really doing really good radio.  That's how it works.  For not burning your toast.  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  All right.  We have a radio show to do. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  It's booby day.  How's that working?  Well, we were hoping to get a studio full of women.  I think we have two.  Can we change it to boob day and just make it about Eric?  Offense.  Well, we'll see if, uh, is booby day going to work today, Steve?  What do we got?  What do we got for booby day on the Spine Whip Him Out Wednesday?  We have one lady coming in confirmed.  One.  We break you now?  Let's go to the bathroom. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  Well, let me tell you.  What are you doing?  I can't wait.  Oh, my God.  He's clenching.  He's clenching.  Oh, my God.  I just waddled to the bathroom.  I wish that was over there.  Dude, he pulled his jeans down before the door got closed.  I know.  He actually clenched and was walking like Charlie Chaplin.  All right.  We got one girl for booby day.  All right.  Well, here's a plus.  A few months back, we couldn't get any.  Right?  Come on.  Let's look at this a little on the positive side. 
[00:23:00]  One girl.  Is she here?  No, she's on her way.  She's on her way.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's H-Cup Jane.  H-Cup Jane.  She's on her way.  No, she's an attention-seeking whore.  She'll be here.  Don't.  Please.  She will still be here.  Right now, she's making the U-turn.  She loves.  Wow, if that's what you call me.  She loves attention.  She will be here.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Don't green it.  It was the other girl from Hempstead, Jacob.  Jacob Jen.  Yeah, she's.  Jacob Jen.  She's the one we haven't been able to. 
[00:23:30]  Contact since she said she would be on the show, right?  See, we know this stuff.  We said that would have happened.  Remember last week?  Come on.  It's something to do for the day.  All right.  It's nice and warm in here.  We're just getting started.  Today, we say, hello, New York, and hello, Chicago.  Chicago.  And I guess we get more ratings today.  Oh, God.  See how that works out.  Oh, man.  It's like a period.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's all about Chicago, and Eric and Kathy.  We got some listener submissions that we'll play next. 
[00:24:00]  Some terrific stuff.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Holy crap, Jimmy. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, wow.  No joke.  Could be the worst ever.  What the hell did you eat last night?  Honestly?  Honestly, last night?  I don't know if this is what it is, but I had oysters.  Oh.  I don't know if one was bad.  My girlfriend and I both got one that was a little dicey, but I don't feel like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, now we get to have the enjoyment of your oysters.  Jimmy went into the bathroom before the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, Jimmy kind of clinched and did the Charlie Chaplin walk into the bathroom, and then he  just came out when we were coming back live, and he shut the door immediately, walked over  here, and just the residual odor.  Look at E-Rock.  E-Rock can't even go in there.  He was going to go in there with a microphone.  It is so bad.  It was really bad, man.  No, it's not.  I swear to God. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, it is so bad.  Usually I laugh alongside you, but today, man, that is bad.  Hold on.  Go in there.  You guys should go in there now, because of your error yesterday.  Jimmy loves trying all types of foods.  Yeah.  Every day he's mixing foods that a normal human being should never mix.  Why don't you just eat like chicken and rice?  He'll eat.  What's wrong, Steve?  They can't even go near the closed door.  He can't even go near the door, man.  I'm five feet away from it, and it smells horrible.  He's five feet away from the closed door. 
[00:26:00]  That is like a gas chamber.  What else did you have besides oysters?  I don't know.  Half and half.  Are you sick?  I don't know.  I'm starting to feel a little like that, and that was about seven hours ago that I ate  them, so it could be that.  Oh, boy.  Where do you have oysters?  At McDonald's?  No.  Yeah.  The oyster closet.  It's a nice, warm place.  They keep them.  Dredged from the East River?  No.  Where do you have the oysters?  This place in downtown.  Did you go to Arizona?  Wow.  Where did you get these bad oysters from? 
[00:26:30]  No.  They said they were Hudson River Specials.  Yeah.  They scrape them off the top of the Lincoln.  They're growing off some old mobster's skeleton.  What remains of his skeleton.  Yeah.  What remains of his skeleton.  I can't believe how bad this is.  It really is.  It's really now drifting over, and I've used Lysol on my mic so I can keep my nose against  it.  Yeah.  You've got to go in there right now.  That's right now.  Just go in, but shut the door immediately.  All right.  You've got to shut yourself in there.  Go.  Now, this is like some kind of space mission. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock's near the door.  Okay.  Get in there and shut the door immediately.  He's got a microphone.  Go.  On three.  One.  Two.  Don't hold your breath.  Three.  Go.  Shut the door.  Shut the door.  Shut the door.  Wow, Jimmy. 
[00:27:30]  Congratulations.  I've never seen that happen.  E-Rock.  E-Rock puked.  He left the mic, and then he's spitting.  He's sweating.  You all right, E-Rock?  What does it smell like?  What?  Oh, God.  I mean, it smells bad.  It's coming out.  It smells bad out here, but what does it smell like in there?  He's released the Kraken.  What does it smell like, E-Rock?  Low tide and sewage. 
[00:28:00]  What's the name of the restaurant I ate?  Hey, you've got to get that garbage can out of there.  That's gross.  Did you puke up some stuff?  That's gross.  It was...  Yeah.  Oh, wonderful.  There you go.  Oh, God.  I'm going to be running back in there shortly.  Yeah.  It is really bad in here.  It's amazing how bad it is.  It really is amazing.  Wow.  That made E-Rock vomit.  How great is that?  Wow, Jimmy.  You are sick.  Yeah, man.  That is a sick smell.  Oh, God. 
[00:28:30]  It just keeps on coming, man.  It's so thick.  Those oysters keep on giving.  It's like...  It's hanging in the room here like a London fog.  It really is.  It's hanging here like an uncomfortable moment.  It smells as bad as our ratings in Boston.  Oh, God.  I just...  I swear I need to see a sign under my nose here with some Vicks.  All right.  Are we good?  Yeah, I might have to run. 
[00:29:00]  So what happened last night?  Some oysters?  I don't know, man.  You're getting a lot of food poisoning.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  It wasn't food poisoning.  So you're like me.  We eat out almost every night because that's what you do when you live in New York.  But I'm so careful at this point.  I eat just basic crap when I go to these restaurants.  I don't trust any of them.  I was watching rat videos before the show today, man.  If you want to have some fun, throw in rats or whatever into the YouTube search.  Yeah, man.  Oh, you'll get some fun, fun videos.  And out of nowhere, you get hot chicks stripping, so...  Like you were saying the other day, you're only one or two clicks away from porn at any 
[00:29:30]  given time.  At any given time.  David Hinckley wrote a pretty interesting article in the paper today here in New York  about the rats they found at the KFC and all that.  And he said something about going to YouTube, whatever, and looking at rat videos, something  the average person would never do.  And I'm like, you know what?  That sounds kind of interesting.  Check out some rats.  I pop rats in, and I'm watching the rats at the KFC, where it's just amazing how many  there were. 
[00:30:00]  You know the story from last week, hopefully.  Self-explanatory.  And then the second video in is this hot chick stripping.  I'm like, what does this have to do with...  How does this tie in?  Not that I'm complaining, but I'm like, what does this have to do with rats?  I've decided I just want to see rat videos today.  And then it's just hot teenage girls stripping as much as they will allow on YouTube.  That's because they'll put a search for anything.  But who would think to put rats under the search key for hot girls dancing? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  But they're there.  There's a lot of them.  Oh my God, Jimmy.  Holy crap.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not.  I actually am not.  That's awesome with the outdoor.  It's amazing.  And you're not sitting today.  No.  Yeah, look.  He's standing up now.  He can't sit.  What else did you have?  A little tender.  No, no, no.  Not at this point.  Yeah.  No, I don't know what else I had.  I'm wondering if it's just...  Because the other day, I think I just had a bug, to be honest with you.  Stomach bug?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Bug.  But yesterday, I was having, let's just say, certain problems taking care of certain things.  And boy, this morning, I certainly didn't.  My body was gearing up like that.  It was almost like I wanted to attack.  And they said, no, let's wait till more hardware is here.  And then you can fire it all at one time.  And now here's the question I have today.  Why would you turn this off today?  Why would you turn this off?  Why?  We know Jimmy's sick.  This is a very unpredictable show.  Maybe because you're eating stew?  What other radio show has a bathroom 10 feet away from where they broadcast? 
[00:31:30]  I mean, it's literally 10 feet away from Jimmy.  Yeah.  There's no privacy as far as fragrance goes.  No.  Yeesh.  And we leave each other little gifts.  It's just terrific for everybody.  No, you leave.  And they're not little.  What?  You leave gifts.  Oh.  I want to paint it yellow and carry it through the village.  And people have their photograph taken like it's a python.  Put it over my shoulder mightily and name it.  I had a folder the other day, man.  That is just wonderful.  Cool. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Hey, Chicago, what's up?  Drew Hayes up there in Chicago.  Very happy we acknowledged Chicago yesterday.  And we're going to acknowledge them again because for some reason they like us in Chicago.  Yeah.  Don't like us in Boston.  Like us in Chicago today.  Yeah, it's kind of weird, right?  It's unpredictable.  Where did Jimmy go?  He's doing the show from...  No, I'm still up right over here.  Yeah.  From an echo chamber.  Jimmy, why is your mic echoing all of a sudden?  I'm not sure, actually.  I think it's more the fact this side of the studio is just a little quieter. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  So, Jimmy.  Yeah.  We have some audio.  Yeah.  From Chicago.  Yeah.  That's what we've been listening to.  Jimmy, are you a fan of Eric and Kathy?  Yeah, I was just playing a little audio from their show. 
[00:33:00]  We were a little bit before the show started.  Yeah.  And we got to listen to it a little bit.  It's fun.  Yeah.  What is Al doing with this?  What is the rules?  On what?  We're just...  Gentlemen, please.  Oh.  That figures.  What do you say, Al?  I don't know.  Well, Jimmy has left the program.  E-Rock has pretty much left the program.  Your color's coming back.  You went white, E-Rock.  It dropped me. 
[00:33:30]  As soon as you walk in, you just fall on the floor.  It dropped me.  It's like watching World War I footage when they leave the trench and the gas hits, and  the guys just drop from the nerve gas.  You start convulsing and have no control over your legs and your arms.  You're just laying there, just shaking.  That's amazing.  Really funny.  All right.  So, we're on a...  Chicago.  We're on an Eric and Kathy kick.  Eric and Kathy, I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  They seem to be doing well in Chicago.  Yeah.  They're one of the many shows beating us in Chicago.  I can't figure it out because they stink.  And that's what's really frustrating to us because then we listen to their audio like,  wow, why are people choosing to listen to Eric and Kathy over the Opie and Anthony show?  And then we listen to this audio and we get really, really mad.  We're like, who is listening to this crap?  This predictable radio.  It's that same type of just, like I said, milk toast. 
[00:34:30]  Just nothing.  And there's the guy and the woman that sits there and just goes, oh, oh, God.  Oh, no.  Just has nothing to say.  And then they read news stories, word for word out of the paper.  And then their comments about the story they just read to their audience is who gives a crap.  It's just kind of, yeah?  Oh, really? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And that's doing well.  I'm kind of stalling because I know Jimmy loves Eric and Kathy audio.  Yeah.  Jimmy!  Oh, I'm right here, Ope.  Yeah, he's right here.  Where are you?  Right there.  Where?  See him kind of by the console over there?  Is he a ghost?  A little more.  No, he can just kind of hunker down.  I think he's laying down on the floor so he feels better.  All right.  If he's right there, why are the headphones on the counter?  Jimmy, why are your headphones on the counter if you're right in front of me?  He's got the other headphones on.  I have better ones that are more conducive with laying down on your belly. 
[00:35:30]  He's laying down.  I see him right here.  Where?  Right there.  He's on the floor?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Are you tricking me?  No.  Why would I trick you?  I don't see Jimmy down there.  He just rolled where you can't see him.  Under the console?  Yeah.  It's like a little cockroach.  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  Jimmy, you're knocking out the entire show.  Dude, how could...  How could... 
[00:36:00]  Oh, no.  No.  Shut that.  How are you doing, Jim?  Hi, guys.  Iraq?  Iraq.  Get back in there.  In.  Immediately.  Take this mic.  Right away.  Right away.  Get in there.  Come on.  Deploy.  Deploy.  Deploy.  Deploy.  Right in.  Right in.  Sergeant.  That's it.  Stand in the door.  You smell it over here.  Yeah, I know.  Right in.  You got to go right in.  Right in.  Right in, girl.  What's the matter with you?  Check equipment.  Don't you care about people?  Wait, Iraq.  I'll help you out. 
[00:36:30]  On three again.  Stand in the door.  One.  Two.  Three.  Go.  Shut the door.  Get in there.  Shut the door.  No.  Shut the door.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  He's holding his nose.  He didn't want it to happen that time.  He held his nose.  I've never seen anyone do that in my life.  What's wrong?  Why did you leave?  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:00]  You know you can get fired for leaving before we tell you to?  That's right.  Well, good luck with human resources.  I'm tasting it in my mouth.  That'll be $5.  Wow.  It is unbelievable.  It is.  This is beyond belief, dude.  Really?  It's beyond anything.  I'm usually the last.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have to leave.  I have to leave.  I'm usually the last one to go down, man. 
[00:37:30]  I can't take this today.  Holy Jesus.  Is there a paper towel in here?  Yeah.  I got to soak it in something.  Hopefully, cyanide.  Jimmy, you're knocking out the entire show.  I'm sorry.  I'm actually embarrassed.  We're trying to broadcast it to countries.  I'm embarrassed.  They don't want to hear this crap.  Or do they?  Who knows?  Oh, God.  I got to hold a paper towel with Lysol.  Jimmy, what else?  Oysters and what else?  Something else is going on.  A corpse.  I had oysters and salmon, which was well done. 
[00:38:00]  Half and half.  No, turkey sandwich during the day.  I ate healthy.  I've been eating healthy for the last three days.  Healthy?  Yeah.  I've eaten like not fatty food.  And something's happening in the translation.  Some wasabi crackers.  A few of those.  From point A to point B, something's happening.  This is the new diet sweeping the nation.  Wow.  I have no desire to eat breakfast now.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, there's no way I could possibly eat in here. 
[00:38:30]  This is horrific.  If anyone new now walks in that door, it's going to be that much worse.  And I'm not, let me tell you, honestly, I'm not, I, since I've been here this morning,  I'm not doing anything in the studio area.  I know.  It's all, it's all legit going to the, should we go?  Get somebody that hasn't been in here yet.  Because now our, you know, when there's an odor in the air, your, your receptors kind  of get dulled to the smell.  I want to see somebody's reaction that hasn't been in this studio yet. 
[00:39:00]  Let's say hi to Tom in Boston.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, why do they keep, sorry, they keep dumping out of gym.  What do you mean they're dumping out?  For what?  Boston better not be dumping out.  Al knows the rules.  Al, Al keeps everybody safe.  Yeah, I haven't said a word, but yeah.  Oh, they're dumping.  All right.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  Thanks, Tom.  We got, we got Butcher in studio.  Butcher.  Is the whole studio like just a wreck?  It's, it smells like hot death and Lysol. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, man.  Hot death.  What do you eat, man?  Oysters.  Oysters.  Ooh.  Bad oysters.  I love they were bad.  Oh, they were bad.  They had a bit.  No seafood is good.  I think I'd be really sick if I had bad oysters eight hours ago.  No, I don't mean bad where it would make you sick.  I mean just bad enough where it's doing this.  It's making everyone else sick.  Well, can you.  You got like.  That's a bad oyster.  You got like typhoid oyster.  Yeah.  It's a carrier.  Can you eat oysters and like, like, can you eat food that's like just does not agree with you, 
[00:40:00]  but it's not going to make you food poisoning sick?  I guess so.  You, you are obviously sick.  Yeah, there's a difference.  You have some type of, of thing going on.  Some type of parasite.  That, yeah, that is making you not right.  That is releasing some odors.  It's not making you regular.  Yeah.  No, there's all sorts of stages of food poisoning.  Yeah.  You know, there's the, there's the, there's the kind that will hospitalize you for, for  a week or so.  And then there's others that are like.  That hospitalize your. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  People you work with.  And then there's the quick one.  It's like 12 to 24 hours.  You're yawning a lot.  That's food poisoning.  Who doesn't love the puking Iraq?  Yeah.  Puking Iraq.  Puking Iraq.  My new favorite character.  Great, man.  Dude, that time he's like, screw this.  And it just shows you it's not for the radio.  He went in there.  He did not want to smell it at all the second time.  So he held his nose as tight as he could.  And that's the noise you were hearing because he was still like puking, even though he had  his nose, uh, uh, clamped.  He smelt it breathing through his mouth.  Yeah.  Walk in there for a second.  How bad is that? 
[00:41:00]  Don't bring my food in there.  Oh my God.  It's too late.  It's been contaminated.  Craig, can you, Craig, can you go, uh, get me some tissues?  I got a, I got a runny nose.  Get the boss some tissues.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Let's go.  You don't need a mic.  Just.  Man, why would he need a mic to get me?  Tell him to stay in there.  It's a chamber of death.  That is a chamber of death. 
[00:41:30]  I'm actually embarrassed.  I'm never embarrassed.  Jimmy, you should be.  It's really bad, man.  Oh, what?  What?  Oh, they're locking him in there.  They just, they locked him in there.  He's going to be dead.  They're holding the door so he can't get out.  It's so repulsive.  Craig.  You all right?  No, he's not.  Hey, Craig.  Yeah.  You all right? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  This is going to take, this won't go away all day.  No.  Are there fans on in here of some way, shape or form?  Is that on?  No.  All right.  Get that thing cranking.  Well, there's no fans in Boston.  All right, Craig.  You can come out.  You good?  What does it smell like?  It's going to be in his clothes.  It smells like someone just went to the bathroom.  Okay.  Well, great. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Thanks for all that work.  Yeah, really.  Why don't we take the mic away from Craig?  Yeah.  He's better at getting coffee.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Ready?  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female.  Okay.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:43:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  And all right, here we go.  I'm going to be at the Addison Improv in Addison, Texas, right outside of Dallas.  March 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th.  One of my favorite clubs to play in the country.  I love that place.  So make sure you come down, all you O&A asses, and say hello. 
[00:43:30]  And buy some fucking tickets and pass the word.  Should I not swear in these?  Should I do like a clean version?  Like that would be the, hey, fuckheads, come on down to the Addison fucking Improv.  You fuck, fuck, the fuck, cocksuckers.  Suck it and fuck it and lick it.  And then I'll do a clean version like, hey, I'll be at the Addison Improv on March 15th through the 18th.  Please come down.  It's one of my favorite clubs to work in the city.  Addison Improv.  Again, the phone number is 972-404-8501.  972-404-8501. 
[00:44:00]  Call for tickets.  You fucking cocksuckers.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Wow stickers, wow stickers, wow stickers.  Get them on that vehicle.  Hopefully the radio station you're listening to us on has wow stickers, and hopefully they're making it easy for you to get your wow stickers. 
[00:44:30]  If not, you make the homemade wow.  Yeah.  Hold on.  That works as good.  As good.  Just as more gooder.  More gooder.  It works for you.  You have to have a wow on your car to be in it.  To win it.  Screw the Powerball and all that crap.  There's only one winner.  Was there?  I don't even know.  Oh.  There's only going to be one winner.  Or maybe a couple that will split.  That's a nice payday.  Yes, I get it.  But most radio contests stink because they try to get a whole audience to listen so they can give away one pair of tickets to see Dave Matthews. 
[00:45:00]  One lousy pair of tickets.  Yeah.  With our contest, we try to get lots of winners.  That's why we came up with Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yeah, your prize.  Lovely breasts.  Yeah, girls will flash you if they see the wow on your car.  Whether it's a homemade sign, a wow sticker, or you write it on the dirt on the back of the car.  It stands for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The girls know that, and they will flash you. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And it's booby day today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Just terrific.  Oh, it's going to be huge.  I know it.  Oh, the girls just clamoring to get in here.  It's unbelievable.  So hard to find room just to broadcast from.  At this point, unbelievable.  Yeah, they're just lining up down the hall.  Don't even open that door because they're going to just rush in.  Run in.  It's going to be the running of the boobies.  That's how it works in our minds.  The reality is we've got one attention-seeking, you-know-what, waiting to come in and flash us. 
[00:46:00]  Lady.  Good egg.  One lousy broad showed up for booby day.  H-cup Jane will be in here in a little bit, right?  Well, at least it's H-cup Jane.  Is she here yet?  She's four minutes out.  Yeah, 20 minutes out.  It was better than A-cup Terry.  I hope it's stuck in traffic somewhere.  I don't know.  I thought booby day would start right away.  But she's 20 minutes out. 
[00:46:30]  Then she's got to find parking.  Then she has to go through security.  Then she has to fill out her paperwork.  She'll be in by noon.  She'll probably be in at like 920.  JV and Elvis will have fun with her for three hours.  And then Nick will bang her and we'll be over at XM.  Five homos in a room.  Yeah, that's our luck.  So booby day is working out perfectly, I guess, huh?  Yeah, wonderful.  So what do we know about this Iraqi at the L.A. airport?  It's exactly what I knew was going to happen eventually.  And I don't even know what this guy's about, but this is what's going to happen. 
[00:47:00]  Wired Iraqi man triggers scare at L.A. airport.  An Iraqi national wearing wires and concealing a magnet inside his rectum triggered a security scare at L.A.X. on Tuesday.  But an official said he posed no apparent threat.  He was identified as Fadhal al-Mahihi, which would never tip you off when selling him a ticket.  He set off an alarm during passenger screening.  And there was a magnet in his rectum.  And they said there was also wires associated with it.  I guarantee you this guy is doing some kind of – either he's a nut doing something. 
[00:47:30]  Reconnaissance.  Or it's a test run for real.  Well, and that's how the next bunch of explosives are going to get on planes, inside the body.  Because they do all these test runs.  Absolutely.  It wasn't all of a sudden just 9-11.  They planned for a long time.  They were testing all sorts of stuff.  They went on the flights back and forth.  They tested it out, did dry runs.  And, yeah, I agree with Jim on this one.  Wow.  You can't just say it's a kook is what we're saying.  They want to see what's going to be picked up through these screening machines.  Try it with a magnet because a magnet is not illegal. 
[00:48:00]  It looks a little weird, but let's see if – or the magnet.  Unless he was just an attention.  He might be seeking attention.  He might be just a psycho.  But then, you know, even if he is, certain people could hear about this event and go, hey, that's a good idea.  You know?  Or surgically implanting.  They'll do that or they'll just have a quick little opening the night before or the day of.  You put it in, you numb somebody up, and they get on a plane.  Once they can figure out a way to do it without metal, profiling is the only way.  Why do you think they want to attack with planes again?  It's the best way. 
[00:48:30]  That's the most sensational.  Yeah, it really does wreck everything.  It's terrifying.  Ruins the economy.  Ruins the airlines.  Don't you think they're trying to come up with something new, though, to really surprise us?  Well, how many times can – like, you can have one guy doing such damage.  Airplanes are scary, man, because if a plane blows up in midair, there's very few fears people have that are greater than falling 30,000 feet.  I mean, it's just – it's incomprehensibly scary.  And I think that's what they're going to do next.  It's just awful.  I know some will call up and go, you're the Islamophobe. 
[00:49:00]  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  I am.  When a guy with wires and a magnet is trying to get on a plane and his name is –  They found you at all.  Unpronounceable.  And his name is – yeah, you've got to use a lot of spit to say it.  Well, a lot of saliva is used to say the name.  There could be a problem.  That is frightening.  It's terrifying.  Yeah, so what do they do with this guy?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't even know what they can do with him.  They take him out back and give him a beating?  Of course not. 
[00:49:30]  Send him to Gitmo.  Send him down to Cuba.  Take the – sick him on – let him hit him with the phone books.  Phone books in the belly.  Where – who are you working for?  WAP.  With a Dick Tracy fedora on.  I'm going old school.  I don't know how to get out of this.  I'll say hi to –  We can't use your nickname, ma'am.  What's your real name?  I know.  I know you can't say it.  It's Free FM.  Hi, guys.  What's your name? 
[00:50:00]  It's Chris, but you guys know me as the initials BTM.  BTM.  Big, blank, monster.  Exactly.  Cool.  All right.  And how big are you there?  42H.  You guys saw them.  42H.  We saw them?  Yeah.  I remember.  Came in with my blind friend, Islanders guy.  We gave you like an hour of radio a couple months back.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Hello.  You were going to come in for booby day?  I was, but I'm frigging sick as hell, man. 
[00:50:30]  What do you have?  What's the matter?  You might be going around.  No, I have strep throat, but thankfully it's not AIDS, so.  All right.  Strep throat.  Wait, we made you do some awful things with your blind friend, and he was just a friend,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember.  You were a guy's influence on that, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you were good.  You were a trooper.  Thanks.  You did some crazy things, and you didn't even like the guy.  You're just really close friends.  Are you still just friends?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  We're just buddies.  That didn't wreck your relationship?  No, not at all.  We're like, we're awful anyway, so it's like, okay, whatever that happened, it was a bonding  experience.  Well, we wanted to help out the blind guy because, you know, he doesn't get much.  No.  This particular blind guy, I'm not talking about all blind guys, but it was obvious this  guy's getting nothing.  And you were there with these things.  These things.  These things.  The H's.  So we figure, what the hell?  Let the blind guy have a little fun. 
[00:51:30]  In the words of Celine Dion, let them touch you.  Come on, let them.  Yeah, we...  He had a lot of fun, and we both did, actually.  We would have come back to see you guys sooner, but, you know, we're fags.  All right, well, we're going to have another booby day that hopefully will be a lot more successful  than the first one that is happening as we speak, and you could be a part of that one.  It's like, it'll end up in 10 years.  This will be a big festival.  Yeah, you think?  Okay.  And we'll talk about how it started out with one girl in a studio. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Aw.  All right, thank you.  Love to Norton.  But, all right, guys.  I will let you go because I'm not bringing anything more to the table.  And thank you for everything, okay?  You called just to make us even sadder.  Can you make it near the table?  Aw, my boobs are, you know, they're pining for you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Is Jimmy in studio?  I'm right here.  Oh, shut up.  Hi, Jimmy.  I have a sour stomach. 
[00:52:30]  You do realize this isn't a phone conversation, right?  Yeah.  Right.  I know.  I know.  You're not my friends.  I just...  I just...  At least one of these idiots has it right.  All right, thank you.  Bye, sweetheart.  We'll see you next time.  All right, let's say hi to John on Long Island.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, John.  Okay.  Hey, listen.  You didn't get the whole scoop on that thing with the Iraqi guy?  That's all I had on this Reuters thing.  Well, yeah, they found more stuff in him.  Let's just say in him, okay? 
[00:53:00]  So they don't dump out.  Who knows if they're dumping out?  But Jimmy said the magnet was found and some wires.  Some wires, yeah.  But there were other things found.  A stick of bubble gum?  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  And a rock.  And a rock.  Whoa.  Yeah.  That's talking to John and Jeff this morning.  Is this guy the MacGyver of Iraq?  Exactly.  That's the same line they use.  Oh.  I swear to God I don't listen to John and Jeff.  Oh, great.  What's happening here?  Hey, it took them 45 minutes. 
[00:53:30]  What?  To come up with that.  Yeah, it took them 45 minutes to tell the whole story.  They teased it to hell.  Bubble gum and a rock.  Bubble gum, rock, magnet.  And a few wires.  Whatever elements.  Obviously, they're looking to see if certain elements are setting off.  Yeah.  There's certain things that are in a rock.  Elements that make up a rock, obviously, they'll be using some kind of explosive.  Unless he's just a wacko.  But he's trying to see if certain elements will set off the alarm.  Yeah.  They're going to ban bubble gum now.  Yeah, and then magnets.  They're going to ban chewing gum. 
[00:54:00]  You watch.  How about just banning these people?  I like that.  God almighty.  First it was water, and now it's going to be gum?  What am I supposed to do on a flight?  Just look at Kenny and go, hi.  I want to chew gum and have my water.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm not yelling.  Because you're angry.  Oh, boy.  I'm not.  I'm scared.  Here's Jacob Jen.  Of course, today is booby day.  Why is Jacob Jen calling us on a phone?  I don't know.  Jacob Jen, what's up?  What's up?  Hi.  What do you got going on?  I'm chilling.  I was just talking to whoever the screener was. 
[00:54:30]  I'm like, yo, I got talked out of it.  By who?  People.  Because the realization that I'd have to be on pal talk cameras.  They're like, you know you're going to be on the internet, and you're going to be surrounded  by all these interns.  I'm like, I don't want that.  You wouldn't have to be on the internet.  If you didn't want the pal talk cameras on, we'd turn them off.  Yeah, we don't give a crap about those people.  I mean, we like them, but it's your choice.  Radio's the first, you know.  Yeah, we like them to a point.  But if they're going to be C-blocking us, then screw them. 
[00:55:00]  We turn that camera right off.  We have a few interns.  We'll break it.  Right, we'll break it if we have to.  But the interns don't bother you.  What do you think that they do?  They're more scared than you are.  They don't want to lose their gig.  Yeah.  They're not allowed to look.  Are you serious?  Yes.  We have human resources issues.  Steve's almost to the point where he can look, and he's been with us for eight years.  Don't give me that human resources.  It's the truth.  It's like you can't subject them to certain things, which is considered a hostile work  environment. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  It would be hostile for them if I was there.  No, no, no.  Because interns find boobies icky.  Yes.  Our interns don't like them whatsoever.  They don't like the boobies.  So that would be a problem.  They'd go right to HR with that one.  Right, right.  Stupid HR.  Why is HR in fob with the radio?  When did that happen?  To ruin it just a little more.  So stupid.  So what friends of yours talked to you at?  It's either here's one of those.  Is it a boyfriend, or was it your guy friend who tells you you're like his sister, but deep  down you know he wants to sleep with you?  Yeah.  The guy friend.  Of course it was. 
[00:56:00]  Of course it was.  C-blocking ass.  Is he the guy that you know has feelings for you, or sexual feelings, but he plays it off  like, dude, I'm just being protective because I care about her.  But you can feel his vibe, and you don't want to acknowledge it because you like the guy  as a person, and you don't want to acknowledge the fact that he wants to sleep with you.  Damn, Jimmy.  It's the truth.  Have you been there?  You just know.  That's exactly what it is.  Because there's nothing more repulsive than the energy of the phony guy friend.  Yeah.  Because I have real guy friends who are just like, you know there's nothing there. 
[00:56:30]  But the guy that Jimmy just explained, you feel that, and that's why you'll never give  that guy the time of day when it comes to a real relationship.  True.  You feel that weakness.  True.  So how do you let him talk you out of it?  Yeah.  Because you do think of them as a friend, and then you start hearing this stuff, and I  mean, I have a job that if people...  But it's boobie day!  I'm sorry.  Has he ever hit on you, this guy?  Oh, no.  But you get his energy, like he's always waiting to see what your signal is? 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  He's a phony.  And he's a phony, and he's a C-blocker, and his energy stinks.  And you know, he got me out of boobie day, because I'm basically going into the office  right now.  Well, tell the guys to pack up the noisemakers and the balloons.  This boobie day is going to be a bust.  Oh, let me tell you.  We had confetti and everything.  Yeah.  We had little pointy hats for everybody.  Oh, I'm sure.  We had a boobie cake. 
[00:57:30]  But it's boobie day!  And you're not coming.  Well, how about when can you come in?  You sound like you'd be willing to if you know you're not going to be on the internet.  Yeah, that's my main thing.  That's fine.  Unless, you know, the O&A show is willing to front my mortgage.  You're not going to do that.  I can't be messing with my job like that.  We won't put you on the internet.  Look, I don't even know what pal talk is, to be honest with you.  You know, those people go screw.  It's just something around there, right?  Who the hell are they?  Trust me.  You have stupid energy.  I'll show you my priorities.  No problem.  You get your big boobies in here.  Pal talk goes out the window. 
[00:58:00]  Does he badmouth guys you date?  Like, maybe not overtly, but things like, well, you know, I don't know.  I mean, is he right for you?  He's just like one of those subtle.  One of those sad sack.  I hope he's listening right now.  You're a sea-blocking cancer.  There's nothing worse than you, you guy friend douche.  And you're the worst?  And you're never going to get anything from Jacob J.  Never.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that guy's not right for you, I don't think.  No, he seems like a nice enough guy, but...  Guys, guys, don't bring the balloons in. 
[00:58:30]  Booby Day's a bust.  They're trying to bring balloons in.  Yeah, save the helium.  Save.  No, take the banners back out.  Put on the confetti.  Yeah, it's done.  So the balloons with, like, the J-Cup Jen logo on them, they're going out.  We had pointy hats and everything.  Aw.  Not quite pointy.  They were a little rounded on top to fit the theme.  Well, they were nice cones.  Yeah.  Nice cone hats.  Madonna era.  Well, we'd still like you to come in, Jen.  We'll be nice, and... 
[00:59:00]  You promise you'll be nice to me, and I won't be on the camera?  Yeah.  By the way...  Bring that jackass so we can berate him.  Yeah, he's a pony.  By the way, Jim and Jersey are off the instant feedback.  Opie called it, and this C said she was going to be there no matter what.  You called it, Opie.  Just another C that made us some lame-ass excuse.  All right, I'm a C.  No, she's...  I think she's sincere.  She's not a C.  She's a J.  Yeah.  She's calling up about telling the truth.  She's worried about her job, and what happened was she listened to guys she thought was just  looking out for her.  But how about you call us, and then we negotiate here? 
[00:59:30]  Well, that's what I did.  I'm doing that now.  I mean, I'm not coming in today, but I was on the phone up until last night.  Well.  We'd still like her to come in.  We'd ever see her now.  Well, maybe she'll come back for the next booby day.  Her guy friend panicked her, man.  She was worried about her job.  That's all it was.  Why is Kenny rolling in the cake?  Kenny!  We don't need the cake.  We don't need the booby day cake now.  Put it in the freezer for next time. 
[01:00:00]  Lisa, West Palm Beach, what's up?  Hey.  What's it going to be with West Palm Beach this month?  Are you going to love us or hate us?  We'll find out soon, I guess.  I know.  I said that already.  Hi, Lisa.  Where are you from?  And I have good boobies, too.  Lisa, where are you from?  I'm thinking about this, right?  Lisa, where are you from?  What if I'm from West Palm Beach?  Oh.  Okay, you got it, right?  And I have great boobs.  Lisa.  So I'm sticking with the booby thing.  Lisa, it says you're calling from Jersey.  Where are you calling from?  West Palm Beach.  Oh, West Palm Beach.  All right.  Okay, just because I have a hole doesn't mean I am a hole. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  And he was thinking about this.  All right, go ahead, Lisa.  If some guy had other things up his butt, and he was an accomplice to the guy that had  the magnet and the rock, right?  Oh, we're going back to real news.  Wait, was it one guy or two guys?  I thought we were going to talk about your boobies.  How big are your boobies, Lisa?  They're D's.  They're D's.  I don't have an H or a J.  They're just D's.  But they're good.  They're like silver dollars during the warmth, and then in the cold, they turn into quarters. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  You know?  You get it?  Yes.  It's kind of nice.  I love it.  They're not like pencil erasers.  Like, really?  Sexy.  Turn into quarters?  When does the annoying voice go away?  That's sexy.  It never does.  I'm sorry.  They look like they're wearing Pete Rose wigs.  All right, Lisa, you got more to the Iraqi story?  I do.  So, okay.  Ready?  Think about it.  The one guy has the magnet and the wires up his butt, right?  We just said not to say that, because I don't know if they're dumping out of that. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  Even though it's a news story, and we should be able to openly talk about this, because  it's, after all, the safety of America, you know.  Right.  We should be informing people.  Absolutely.  Where they're carrying these materials.  Just say, we all know where this stuff was at this point.  Okay.  They stopped the Iraqi at the...  Oh, my God.  It was hidden.  You're talking.  It's the Lisa radio show.  We know where it was hidden, so just go on with the rest of your...  Okay.  So, say he has an accomplice, right?  How cold is it?  How cold is it, Lisa?  And that guy has some other stuff. 
[01:02:00]  Lisa, how cold is it in Buffalo right now?  I'm sorry.  How cold is it?  It's 55 this morning, but it'll probably get up to like...  In Buffalo?  No, in West Pompeii.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh.  All right.  Linda, go ahead.  Okay.  Really?  They're messing with me.  Now she turns up from here.  All right.  Yeah, I think I'm just being mess with it.  But what about if they had...  Some guy had an accomplice, right?  Oh, this is hypothetical.  And he also had things that made it through.  Right.  And they just met up with each other on the plane and pulled a blanket thing like that 
[01:02:30]  guy did the day before.  Oh, and then they kind of put it all together.  A little fun under the blanket?  Yes.  Then we'd really be in danger, don't you think?  Absolutely.  All right.  Well...  I think if a couple of Arab gentlemen are sharing a blanket like that and tussling underneath  it a little bit, I think that could be a problem.  Yeah.  Well, they wouldn't do that.  One would go to the bathroom and leave things somewhere, like whatever, and then the other  would go.  Believe me.  You know?  Yeah.  Or one would put it in his overhead, and then someone else would go and get something out 
[01:03:00]  of that overhead.  No one would even notice.  It would be very, very scary.  I want to thank Lisa for adding absolutely nothing to the radio show today.  Thanks, Lisa.  Thank you.  I'm late.  See you later.  All right.  Peace out.  Bye.  Laura from Kentucky.  Let's say hi to Bill in Chicago.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, we love you.  We love you in Chicago.  We love Chicago.  Listen, I listen.  I drive a truck early in the morning, deliver meat for a living.  You guys are fantastic.  You're the best thing on morning radio here.  Thank you.  Oh, my goodness.  Thank you.  Well, we only have 30 shows to beat, so thank you for that. 
[01:03:30]  And, Jimmy Norton, I blew a poppy all over the inside of my truck listening to you describe  your girlfriend blowing treats back into your face.  Oh, thank you very much.  Yeah, she was blowing a...  After my girlfriend and I did certain things, she was just saying, hey, how's my breath?  Right in my face, and it was disgusting, and I...  That's a keeper right there, Jimmy.  Oh, dude.  Maybe that.  You got to think that's a keeper, right?  Yeah, she did it to me last night, too.  Aw.  Yeah, she had to leave.  She goes, breath check.  I'm like, ugh.  God almighty, why don't I warn you from now on? 
[01:04:00]  No, but you guys are fantastic, and we love you here in Chicago, so don't listen to any of that BS.  No, man.  This month, Chicago loves us.  Who knows what's going to happen next month in Chicago?  But this month, it's New York and Chicago that loves us.  Philly, you can't tell, because they have a whole new system of deciding what people are listening to.  And no one knows how to read it.  No one knows how to read it, yeah.  We're bringing in like a code breaker.  And Boston absolutely despises the show this month, so you figure it out. 
[01:04:30]  Well, I'll be listening next month and every month after that, so keep up the good work, guys.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Speaking of reading, Kenny was reading something this morning.  He had to get his glasses out and put them on, and he's reading.  And I swear, I felt like I was back in third grade with that poor little kid who couldn't read.  And whenever the teacher picked on him to read, it was just like, here's what he did.  An Iraqi national wearing wires and concealing a magnet. 
[01:05:00]  Like, they don't know about punctuation or anything either.  It's, pose no apparent threat, the man identified.  But he reads like a little kid with a reading problem.  We have a security breach, and nothing says safety like grandma glasses on your 6'4 bodyguard.  When the, yeah, when the big bodyguard security guy wants to read something and takes out these granny Ben Franklin glasses, puts them on. 
[01:05:30]  I don't know about you, but I felt very, very safe this morning.  And by the way, this is reading like a retarded child.  And before, like, people start talking, the security breach is really not that big of a deal.  No, no, it's not.  But, you know, Kenny's checking into things, and he puts on his little grandma glasses.  We're being protected by foghorn, leghorn, nephew.  Right.  El nerdo. 
[01:06:00]  Kenny's driving.  Kenny needs better glasses, because he drives to a lot of the gigs I do.  He comes with me.  And he drives, and it's scary, because he's getting really close to cars and breaking last minute.  I'm like, dude, are you paying?  Do you need glasses?  Did you see that car?  Yeah.  He won't wear them when he drives.  All right.  They're reading glasses.  Listen, it's booby day.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's a lot of things today on the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to take a break.  Yesterday, we were talking about females in radio, and I felt bad after the show.  I do want to acknowledge Kelly from Pugs and Kelly. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about Kelly.  Yeah.  She does something that's much different than the average woman on radio.  Not being a whole.  Yeah.  And we've supported her over the years, and it was just that I wasn't thinking yesterday.  Me neither, actually.  They do a good job.  And I didn't get an email or nothing.  I just went home and thought about it.  I'm like, you know what?  Kelly does do a really good job down there in Dallas with Pugs.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  She doesn't play the role of a hole.  Oh, guys.  So, all right.  Speaking of holes, we got some audio from Eric and Kathy. 
[01:07:00]  That's what I want to hear today.  And we'll do that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:07:30]  H-Cup Jane has entered the building.  Oh, okay.  It's booby day with one girl.  That figures.  And I believe we overprepared.  We got streamers.  We got noisemakers.  We got little almost pointy hats.  I'm not even going to wear mine.  We have an ice cream cake with a nice design that Kenny had to put back in the freezer.  We're not breaking all this stuff out unless we have a real booby day down the road. 
[01:08:00]  Not worth it.  It's not worth it for one lousy broad.  Well, it's going to make our turn around.  We're going to reen it.  Look, man.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  When I'm walking around the streets of Manhattan, they're women.  They're beautiful.  They're lovely ladies.  On the radio, they're broads.  We had a girl, she couldn't wait through the 80 minutes of commercials, so she's gone. 
[01:08:30]  And she had something really good for the program.  Maybe she'll call back.  She's got small boobs and she's got a brain and she wants to tell everybody about it.  I thought that would make a very nice conversation, but she just couldn't wait.  Save her for brainy day.  Brainy no boob day.  Which will never happen.  We'll do it on a Sunday morning here.  Yeah.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  We have some love going out to Chicago.  Want to say hi to everyone listening to us on WCKG. 
[01:09:00]  This is what we're going to do from now on because the ratings are so unpredictable.  When a city loves us, we're going to acknowledge that and just talk about them.  Yeah.  And when a city hates us like Boston all of a sudden hates us, we can't really talk about you guys for a while now.  Because according to the ratings, you're not listening.  No one's listening.  So we might as well focus all our efforts on the cities that like us.  Right.  This month, it's New York and Chicago that like us so far.  Yep.  We have a long ways to go in Chicago, but we're making some headway.  And we're starting to take a look at all the shows that are beating us in Chicago. 
[01:09:30]  And this one, Eric and Kathy, we've talked about them in the past.  They're awful.  They really are.  I think they're syndicated to a few stations too.  I have no understanding what this is about, this type of radio, how anyone can listen to it.  I just don't get it.  It's that guy with the girl.  And it's just awful.  They talk about, and the music beds behind them, they were using like the old syncopated clock thing.  All right, hold on. 
[01:10:00]  Because Jimmy and I just had a little moment, a little thing.  Yeah.  I know the music you're talking about.  I don't know the name of the music you're talking about.  Syncopated?  What is that?  How did you know that?  Oh, it used to be used as the theme for like the Late Late Show or something.  Yeah.  Many years ago.  I get that.  But how did you know that there was a name for that?  I don't know, because there's words to it.  What do you do when you go home?  You're just a creature.  You're just looking and learning things. 
[01:10:30]  What do we tell you?  Learning is for?  Queers.  I know.  But you can't help yourself.  I can't help it.  You love your reading, writing, arithmetic.  I just love absorbing information.  That is useless.  Syncopated.  Syncopated clock.  It's a clock that doesn't work quite right.  And you can hear it going, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  That's wonderful.  Well, they use that, and they use the Baby Elephant Walk song.  Mm-hmm.  That's called the Baby Elephant Walk.  I just thought it was called the D.  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D song.  You might remember it as the Pallavician Dance No. 3 by Borodin.  All these classics can be yours.  Yeah.  Wow.  They put these beds on. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Top of the morning to ya!  Well, little-known fact this morning about Britney Spears,  who is in rehab  while she tried to hang herself  and was actually yelling and screaming  that she wanted to kill herself while in rehab.  How about that?  She's crazy.  And that's pretty much what they'll do.  We got an 11-year-old on the phone.  Seth, New York, what's going on?  Hey, I didn't know Britney Spears tried to hang herself, man. 
[01:12:00]  That's crazy.  Yeah, but she's been depressed.  Can we do a show just for little kids?  Yeah, let's get them right under the demo  that they start counting.  Yeah, if you're a little kid,  you get to get right on our show.  Yeah.  All right?  What do you do for a living, Seth?  What do you do for a living there, little Seth?  Unfortunately, I have to go to school every day.  Which kind of sucks.  What grade are you in? 
[01:12:30]  Sixth.  Sixth grade.  11 years old, sixth grade.  Yeah, you're white.  You like the sixth grade?  Nothing.  Oh, yeah, sixth grade, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, seventh will be better.  Isn't that junior high, seventh?  Yeah.  Yeah, you looking forward to that or no?  The hot girls in the sixth grade, boss.  Hot girls in the sixth grade?  No.  Yeah, you don't got to tell me.  I know.  In the seventh grade.  You know what?  Are you in a car right now?  Oh, yeah.  You driving?  Yeah, where are you driving to? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, we're driving to my school.  Who's we?  Are you and your friends?  What?  Who's we?  Are you and your friends?  Well, no.  It's me and my mom, my friend's mom, and my friends.  Hey.  Hey, hey, Seth.  Is your friend's mom hot?  Uh, why are you asking me this?  Is she a milf?  Yeah, is she a milf?  Is your friend's mom hot?  No, I don't think my friend's mom is hot.  No.  No?  All right, let's put your friend on.  Okay. 
[01:13:30]  What's his name?  Hi, this is Jacob.  Hey, Jacob.  Hey, Jacob.  Is Seth's mom hot?  No.  Is she fat?  No.  But she's not hot?  I don't think he's, I don't think Seth's mom's hot.  No?  What about your mom?  It's, all right, well, let me ask the question differently.  Do you think Seth's dad is hot?  No.  But Seth wants to talk to you.  All right, put Seth back on.  All right, Seth.  Yeah?  Yeah, you're obviously the strong one in the, uh, in the friendship. 
[01:14:00]  You're the alpha male in the friendship.  Yeah.  Jacob is weak.  We don't like him.  Are you a bully?  Do you beat up kids?  As the years go by, I would look at Jacob very closely.  I do need to shoot out the kids.  I keep my eye on Jacob, if you know what I mean.  You need to what?  Okay, okay, I'll keep an eye on him, okay?  Yeah.  I promise you guys.  All right, Seth.  What do you, Seth, what do you, do you listen to the radio a lot, or do you more like listen  to your iPod and, like, iTunes and stuff like that? 
[01:14:30]  Actually, I listen to the radio, uh, I listen to the radio chick.  Yeah.  Um, like, every, I listen to the radio, um, every morning.  Okay.  And it's always, uh, 92.3, and I listen to it, uh, on one day, Tuesday, I mean, not one  day, uh, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then I get at it.  All right.  Seth, wait, what?  I listen to the radio chick, and it's me and Anthony.  You listen to the radio chick?  Yeah, it's me and Anthony is much better, though.  All right.  Oh.  You know Chuck is black, don't you?  The 11-year-olds love us. 
[01:15:00]  All right, Seth, thank you.  Trying to turn him against the...  All right, we want more kids to call us.  We're turning this into a kids' program.  We want a kids' show.  That's right.  Well, I don't like kids' programs.  They bore me.  They're retarded.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Hey, Seth, you want to go to an Islanders game?  What?  Opie will take you to an Islanders game.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to go to the Islanders game with Opie?  Yeah.  All right, hold on a line.  I'm going to get your info and take you to an Islanders game. 
[01:15:30]  All right, how old is that kid now?  Huh?  How old is that kid?  Little Gary?  The famous Gary.  Opie promised to take little Gary to an Islanders game, I think, eight years ago.  He's probably pushing 20.  No, I'm not even kidding.  He's probably pushing 20.  Did he ever call in?  Didn't he call in?  What?  Has he called in or anything?  Updated on what happened to him?  No.  No, no, no.  You never took me to that Islander game, Opie.  Not since the accident. 
[01:16:00]  There was no accident.  What?  There was no accident.  Oh.  He was 12-year-old Gary, right?  And that was like eight years ago.  Well, we were fired.  Seven or something.  Two and a half years off the air.  We've been back almost, about two and a half.  So that's five years, 17.  He's at least 18 years old.  Oh, Jesus.  He's at least 18 now.  He was little 12-year-old Gary.  I know, that's for the old-timers.  Now he's a creepy gentleman, Gary.  Now he's curious, Gary.  Yes. 
[01:16:30]  Explore all options, Gary.  All right.  Listen, Eric and Kathy.  So we're saying hi to everyone that listens to us on WCKG.  So we're paying attention to these shows that are beating us in Chicago.  And this Eric and Kathy, we just don't get.  Anthony explained a little bit.  And we're having fun with their audio.  And we're taking their audio and bringing them into our world.  The world of the shock shock.  Shocking.  Although this show isn't that shocking now, is it?  No.  So, and then now the listeners are getting involved. 
[01:17:00]  They're going to the website and they're listening to this dumb show.  I guess it's online.  And they're taking the audio and they're throwing some bleeps in to make it more edgy and interesting.  So this is Brian and Bayshore.  He picked this Eric and Kathy clip.  It's just horrific.  It's weird.  A bunch of girls want to know, how do you guys feel when the girl eats more than he does?  Consistently.  A bunch of girls want to know, Matt, you okay with a girl who shovels it away like nobody's business? 
[01:17:30]  Actually, I'm not a small guy by any means.  My wife is tiny and she out eats me every time at Ponderosa.  I'm actually impressed with her.  Nice.  I'm not having a perfect curve on, but I'm impressed by it.  You know what, Matt?  You take a woman to Ponderosa and she shovels away more than you.  You hold on to that woman.  That's right.  She's a keeper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all he does.  That's unlistenable.  We were talking about that yesterday.  He does a lot of noises. 
[01:18:00]  He hates what he's doing, but they're giving him a pretty good paycheck for sure.  He doesn't want to be doing this crap with this Kathy Broad.  What do you plot?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  So Brian and Bayshore took that clip and he brought the show into our world.  Yeah.  With a few bleeps, it's much funnier.  That music is the type of thing like a mentally ill person hears in their head. 
[01:18:30]  As the police report, they're found sitting cross-legged with a hammer and a prostitute  knocked out in a hotel room.  That's the music they hear in their head as they're taking away.  That is brilliant.  It's awful.  That is brilliant.  Well, they use those music beds because they know what they're doing is really unimportant  and it's who gives a crap radio, so they try to spice it up a little bit.  That's all.  I like how he started singing to a little da-da-da-da-da-da.  Okay.  All right.  His voice is really phony.  Here's that same clip.  A bunch of girls want to know, how do you guys feel when the girl eats more than he does? 
[01:19:00]  Consistently.  A bunch of girls want to know, Matt, you okay with a girl who sh**s a little like nobody's  business?  Actually, I'm not a small guy by any means.  My wife is tiny and she sh**s me every time at Ponderosa.  I'm a man.  I'm actually impressed with you.  Nice.  Nice.  I'm not a person who's on, but I'm impressed by you.  You know what, Matt?  You take a woman to Ponderosa and she sh**s you.  You hold on to that woman.  That's right.  She's a keeper.  Yeah.  Does she sh** off your f**k too, Matt? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Does she sh** you?  No, not normally.  Okay.  Good thing.  All right.  That's great.  Hey, Brian.  Very good.  He understood the homework assignment.  Very good, Brian and Bashore.  We should hire him.  Yeah.  You're out, Sam.  Brian?  Yeah.  All right.  We have more of this, but we have a seventh grader that's ditching school.  All right.  Good boy.  John in Princeton.  John, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Oh, I love your show.  I always do. 
[01:20:00]  This is your show, John.  We're going for the younger demos.  You're a seventh grader?  You've got a deep voice.  We've got to get these kids before they discover iPods.  So we've got to go for the younger audience, and we've got to grow with them.  That's what we're doing now.  I know my friends at school.  We've got the WOW stickers on our lockers.  Yeah.  Well, what the hell are you seeing in seventh grade, though, John?  Yeah.  Wow.  Dude, I hang out with some high school kids, though.  You might as well just show each other what you're sporting.  It's the same thing.  Yeah.  It's junior high. 
[01:20:30]  What are you doing?  Why did you pick a day like this to ditch?  Oh, it's snowing.  I just didn't feel like going.  Oh, okay.  That rhymed.  Actually, my parents are going to work in a little bit.  I'm going to be smoking some pot.  Smoking some pot?  Yep.  No, I don't believe you.  I don't either.  I used to do that, though.  John, I don't believe you.  Yeah, I don't believe he's that young.  I'd wait out on the...  You want to come over?  You bet I do.  You want to come over?  You and Chris Hanson talking, laughing.  Hi.  Jimmy Norton.  You've come over.  You've brought some marijuana cigarettes. 
[01:21:00]  Are you planning to have sex?  Sure am.  He was on last night.  Yeah.  I was watching a little bit of that.  People still watching that?  Yeah, I guess so.  Now they're showing the decoy girl.  Remember how they would kind of hide her face so you'd only see the back of her?  Now they're showing her.  This girl that was supposed to be 13.  This blonde girl.  Does she look 13?  No.  Like, right when you walk in, you'd be like, oh, my God, Chris Hanson's coming out.  Yeah.  Because you'd know.  But they got some guy who was, I guess he was Indian.  And he came in, and they busted him. 
[01:21:30]  And he was talking about how, I just work for a living.  I don't have fun.  And then he's using, as an excuse, the fact that he doesn't have any sex with his wife.  So he was trying everything.  And then, of course, he was free to go until he got outside.  Well, you've got to think Chris could understand that.  So he let that one go.  He can understand.  So finally, they should let one guy go.  Because that would make great TV.  Like, you know, for a goof, we decided that one guy tonight we're going to let go.  Who's not watching that?  I don't think they'd.  And then the outrage you're feeling at home, like, why are you letting him go? 
[01:22:00]  You'll let him go.  But you want good TV.  But the pedophiles now would feel comfortable because they'd think, well, why don't you know why?  Maybe I'm the guy that gets let go.  Yeah.  So I'm showing up.  See, that's why I've got to produce TV shows.  I can make these TV shows a lot more interesting.  Because it's just a TV show.  You can't take it seriously.  So I would let one of these guys go out of nowhere.  And the cops, like, make the guy look out the window.  See that tree?  That's actually a cop.  See that car over there?  There's three other guys behind that car waiting for you. 
[01:22:30]  You know, see the roof?  Yeah, those are snipers just in case.  But guess what?  We're going to let you go.  And then you film him walking out the house, and the cops just put their guns down to the side and fold their arms and let them walk down the street.  I think it should be, like, game show type thing, though, where you have to win the chance with all the other pedophiles that they've caught to leave without being arrested.  Yeah.  And you win, and you get to walk away to applause and a little prize.  Maybe you get to have sex with the girl.  Well, it's legal because she's not really that age. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, she's not really a kid.  Yeah.  How about you show the pedophile moseying around the house to that music bed?  Just peeking in rooms looking for the awful-voiced person.  All right, listen.  We've got two more 11-year-olds on the phone, okay?  And we're going to talk to them next.  You want to do the last clip from Eric and Kathy for today?  Yeah, let's hear a little more of this wonderful radio.  Sam tried one.  Let's say hi to another Eric in Chicago listening on WCKG. 
[01:23:30]  Eric, what's up?  Really?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Uh-huh.  No, really.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Eric!  Look at that.  Hello?  What's your name, sir?  Hello?  Eric.  Hello?  Yes.  Eric.  Hello?  The guy that I just said Eric to that obviously is not named Eric, say hi.  Uh.  Hello?  Everyone just say hi. 
[01:24:00]  All right, well.  If you hear my voice right now, say hi.  What a tool.  Dude.  You are an ass.  Dude, you're right there.  Say hi.  Say hi.  The guy that said hello?  Hello?  Oh.  Oh, me?  That's what I'll do now.  How about the guy from Chicago who wants to welcome us to Chicago and he thinks Eric and  Kathy suck?  You.  Say hi.  Maybe he's not connected.  He was there.  Just heard him. 
[01:24:30]  All right, anyway, Sam tried to take some Eric and Kathy audio and make it a little more  interesting, a little funnier, a little edgier.  A little edgier.  The original clip is just unbelievable that they would waste this much time on something  like this.  And they're beating us in Chicago.  That's what's just amazing.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you seen this video on YouTube?  It's like exploded all over YouTube.com.  Which one?  It's a couple named James and Julia. 
[01:25:00]  And they completely recreated the final dance scene in Dirty Dancing for their wedding.  For their wedding?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  They did.  What's funny about that?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Really?  That's funny.  No way.  No.  Stop.  No way.  They found a cure for AIDS?  What's funny?  Same reflection.  Inflection.  Inflection.  Inflection.  I was like, wait.  I cried.  Reflection.  She went.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[01:25:30]  You know what's funny?  If YouTube had a couple that reenacted the end of Philadelphia for their wedding.  That's funny.  For their wedding?  Yeah.  Okay.  They did the whole thing.  Oh, my gosh.  That is so funny.  You do every day, Sarah.  The whole thing.  I'm so going to see that.  They go on there.  You know, they're doing the whole dance scene.  He's Patrick Swayze.  He puts her up in the air.  Right.  She's Jennifer Gray.  The whole thing. 
[01:26:00]  He does some nips.  It's had like 650,000 hits.  People are going crazy for it.  It's going to get more today.  And apparently, they've got it down cold.  Are you serious?  That's what I think.  I haven't seen it.  Somebody was telling me about it.  And I checked.  I did some research.  And yeah.  I wonder if they did their practicing in the lake.  Maybe.  Or cheeky soaking wet.  It makes me wonder what kind of guy and what did you have to do to convince him to do this.  Oh, yeah.  I'm.  I'm.  I. 
[01:26:30]  Are you serious?  Are you good?  No.  Yeah, they did.  They did anti-jumpet.  I did the research.  Because I couldn't believe it was true.  I had to see it with my own eyes.  Something called the YouTube.  The YouTube.  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  I.  I.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  They reenacted for their wedding the first 30 minutes of I Spit on Your Grave.  No way.  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:00]  Come on, Chicago.  Help us out.  They all reenacted the drill sergeant private pile scene.  Who threw that whole jacket in the bathroom.  This is the couple that I would like to see 10 years later.  Oh, I thought you were going to say in a drunk driving accident.  Not well.  We're 10 years later.  The guy is arrested for just chopping her up.  Yeah.  And then because that wedding would be like, do you remember when they got married and  did the scene from Dirty Dancing?  What would lead him to chop her up in the bathtub? 
[01:27:30]  Well, let's see what Sam did with that break to make it funnier, edgier, and maybe a little  bit saucy.  Saucy.  A little spicy.  Have you seen this video?  Which one?  It's a couple named James and Julia, and they completely for their wedding.  For their wedding?  Yeah.  Okay.  They did the whole thing.  Oh, my gosh.  That is so funny. 
[01:28:00]  I'm so going to see that.  They go on there, you know, doing the whole scene.  He's so seriously.  Puts her up in the air.  Right.  She's the whole thing.  It's had like 650,000 hits.  People are going crazy for it.  It's going to get more today.  And apparently, they've got it down cold.  Are you serious?  That's what it said.  I wonder if they did their **** in the lake.  Maybe.  Or should he be soaking wet and wiser down?  You know what makes me wonder?  What kind of guy, and what did she have to do to convince him to ****? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Great job, man.  Best one yet.  That's a good one.  The best one yet.  Everything fits perfectly.  Now I want to see the video.  Look at Sam.  He wasn't sure it was going to pass.  By the way, the other one did not.  I crossed it out.  Yeah.  One for two today, Sam.  One for two.  But the one you got.  That's a home run.  Very, very good.  That's a home run.  I got to hear that again, though.  No way. 
[01:29:00]  No way.  She goes, are you serious?  Like, just the joy she feels.  That's something they discussed in the break that they were going to talk about.  Yeah.  It was written down for a day.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Seth from New York.  And we love New York this month.  Yep.  Yeah, we really do.  They seem to like the show this month.  So we got to acknowledge New York.  Seth, you're calling back.  You're 11 years old.  What's up, Seth?  Going to school with mommy and your friend and your friend's mom.  What's up?

[01:32:00]  Mikey, what are you doing?  I'm sitting here listening to the show on the radio, and I'm not going to school because  my bus left me.  You missed the bus?  No, it just left me.  How did it leave you?  Yeah, how does a bus leave you?  You're at the bus stop, aren't you?  I go to Baker Victory, and I might get picked up in front of my house, and we're going outside  and it left.  So you missed the bus.  Are your parents home?  Yeah, my dad's right here.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, we're looking for kids that might be, I don't know, home alone at this point. 
[01:32:30]  Home alone.  We got an idea.  Why doesn't your dad drive you?  Dad's just like, yeah, let's just stay home.  Let's just stay home.  Yeah.  Huh?  We don't have the car.  He doesn't have the car.  What does mom have the car?  I don't have a car.  You don't have a car?  We're poor.  Oh, you're poor.  We're poor!  Jesus.  See, if we had a prize closet, we could at least give him something.  Yeah, we could give you a car.  Well.  That's easy.  Well, if we could give him a car. 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  Well, you know, we could give him something to play with while they think about the fact  they don't have a car.  Hey, Mikey, does Dad drink a lot?  No.  He drinks Mountain Dew all day.  Mountain Dew?  Yeah.  What kind of job does Dad have?  He does tattoos.  He's a tattoo artist.  Oh, you got any tats?  No.  I'm 13.  Do you get the fake ones?  No, I'm 13.  I'm 13.  So, tell your dad you want a tat.  All right, so Dad's doing tattoos.  What is Mom doing?  She makes fruit trays for Walmart. 
[01:33:30]  No, Wegmans.  Wegmans.  She makes fruit plates?  Yeah, like fruit.  Down at the Walmart?  Dude, that should be inspiration enough for you to go to school every single day.  You know that, right?  Can we get in touch with social services immediately?  Wow, Mikey.  You got any, like, video games and stuff?  Yeah, PlayStation 2.  Oh, okay, good.  At least, you know, you're able to play and kind of slip into fantasy land and not have 
[01:34:00]  to deal with the reality that...  Screw a car.  He's got his video game.  Hey, that's cool parents.  They're like, hey, my kid needs his video games.  So, what was...  We can do it without a car.  What was the last tat your dad gave?  How long ago?  He gave my mom one, like, last month.  I mean the last paying gig.  Um, yeah, when was the last time you did a tattoo?  Two weeks ago.  Yeah?  Did he get, like, $10,000 for it? 
[01:34:30]  How do you guys, like, get food and stuff?  My mom's paycheck.  Oh, okay.  What does she do for it?  She makes fruit plates.  She makes fruit plates at the Walmart.  No, Wegmans.  Oh, Wegmans, I'm sorry.  Okay.  I believe it was Wegmans.  Was it?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you said Walmart.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Do you want us to send you food or something, Mikey?  Are you hungry?  Are you hungry, little kid?  You got plenty to eat over there?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Boy, that buffalo.  Yeah.  Thank you, Mikey. 
[01:35:00]  Okay.  Have fun, Mikey.  I would go to school if I was you.  Yeah.  I wouldn't miss a day.  Somehow you should get to school every day, graduate with honors, go to college, and move.  Did Dad stop you from catching the bus?  Where are you going?  School's for queers.  All right, Mikey.  You do good in school.  Okay.  No, do you do good in school?  Yeah.  All right.  And you're part of the free lunch program, aren't you?  Well, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Patterson. 
[01:35:30]  Aaron.  Hello?  Good line.  That was Eron.  Hey, Aaron.  How you doing?  Aaron, what's up?  Good.  What do you got going on?  You're 11?  Yeah.  Why aren't you in school?  Because I pretend to be sick.  Because why?  You're sick?  I pretended to be sick.  Oh, you pretended to be sick.  I don't like that, Aaron.  You're like a little Ferris Bueller.  You took the day off?  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes you're just calling sick.  How did you fake it?  My stomach hurted.  Oh, you said I got a stomach and my stomach hurted. 
[01:36:00]  I'm not supposed to.  Yeah.  Your stomach hurted?  Yeah.  Yeah, and they bought it, huh?  Yeah.  Hook, line, and sinker.  That's nice.  So what are you going to do with yourself all day alone at home?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Is your mom or dad home?  Yeah.  Oh, which one?  Where are they right now?  Right next to me, my dad.  Ah, see, we're looking for the little bastard that's home alone.  That way he can rifle through some stuff.  Yeah, we're looking for a kid that is home alone right now. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  So what is it?  You just said you faked it in front of your dad?  Yeah.  He's not upset with that?  No.  All right, we're not going to get much out of Aaron.  We're getting yes and no answers.  It's like he's testifying in front of Congress.  All right.  If you're a little kid and you're home alone, give us a call.  All right.  Hey, we got an update on the kids that were smoking pot.  Everyone's seen this video by now, huh?  Yeah, it's been played a thousand times on the news. 
[01:37:00]  And now we got the uncle speaking out of the two kids, two and five, and they were smoking  joints with these older siblings, I guess.  I don't know.  They're part of the family somehow.  Somehow related.  And the video, if you haven't seen it yet, it's on YouTube.  It's everywhere.  The kids look way too comfortable with joints.  It's pretty obvious they've been doing this on a regular basis, and they finally got a  video to kind of show people because it looks kind of cool in a weird way.  It does.  It looks funny.  It looks kind of cool, and I don't give a crap because I don't know the kids, you know? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, who cares?  But it is so wrong, it's not even funny.  Well, the uncle doesn't think so.  He's basically saying, what's the big deal?  Really?  Investigators are shocked, and so is anyone who's seen the video.  Police say it shows two Texas men lighting marijuana cigarettes and encouraging two small  children to smoke them.  Both men have been charged with injury to a child.  One of them is the kid's uncle.  He says the media just has blown the whole story out of proportion.  How do you blow the story out of proportion?  It's on video.  The kid's smoking joints. 
[01:38:00]  It's on video.  A kid's smoking pot.  Two and five.  There's no way to blow that out of proportion.  Usually I would agree with a statement like that.  The media likes to blow things out of proportion, but when you have a video where they're puffing  away, there's a problem.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Out of proportion.  Y'all see it on TV, how y'all embarrass me, make it just look, making some smile.  Well, it ain't nothing to smile because it's the kids, and you give them kids weed, but  still, y'all making it just over, y'all over-exaggerating, man, with the whole thing. 
[01:38:30]  Y'all taking it too far.  Them kids is going to smoke sooner or later.  It's going to eventually happen.  Whether I was to do it or whatever.  I love that guy.  Okay, that's his logic, because they're going to smoke anyway, so why not give it to them  when they're two?  Right.  I love that guy.  How do you not love?  He's just, you couldn't get a better ass to make a statement. 
[01:39:00]  He's just resigned to the fact where they're also going to drink, probably, and maybe drive,  have sex, whatever.  Or, why not?  They're going to do it eventually.  And end up like me.  Wow.  I started smoking pot at two.  That is just a mindset that is alien.  Yeah.  The guy has just completely resigned himself to the fact that every child he knows will  just grow up and smoke pot and become pieces of crap like the guys that were giving the 
[01:39:30]  kids the pot.  Yeah.  That's it.  Is that the mindset that's alien to you, or is it the babysitting part?  Well, yeah, that too.  Well, this next track, the last one here, it's labeled, This Intelligent Interview Continues.  I mean, I ain't saying I'm the first to just hear it, smoke this blunt, you know what  I'm saying?  Well, you know what I'm saying?  They said nothing to be famous for.  They said nothing good. 
[01:40:00]  I'm telling you, you know what I mean?  It's just something I was hired, and it's just something that happened that wasn't supposed  to happen.  So that's all I can tell you in this interview, and that's all I'm going to keep telling you  all, is that I'm sorry for what happened, and I'm sorry for the pain that I caused to  my sister and family.  The children are now in foster care and appear to be healthy.  Their mother told police she was asleep when that video was shot.  It's where it gets better and better every day.  Man.  I could listen to that guy talk all day. 
[01:40:30]  His logic is great.  You should run for office.  Oh, wow.  All right.  There's the latest on that.  Let's say hi to Emily.  She's in Ontario.  Ontario?  Emily?  Yeah?  14 years old?  Yeah.  Home alone?  Pardon?  Yeah.  Pardon?  Home alone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing home?  I don't feel like going to school.  No school in Canada?  Are you California or Canada?  Hmm?  Are you California or Canada?  Canada.  Okay.  And where's mom and dad? 
[01:41:00]  Out.  And they have no problem with you being out?  That's Canada, all right.  Yeah, out.  They're out.  Out and about.  What are they working?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what do you say?  I'm sick.  I don't feel like going to school today.  No, I still think I'm at school.  You just blow off school.  You don't want to go and you don't go.  No.  That's nice.  Hey, Emily, you want to help us out today?  All right.  You want to do a little snooping?  You ever do any snooping?  Yeah.  Okay.  K-Rock loves this bit.  I love the snooping, too. 
[01:41:30]  There's only one rule.  Okay.  And this is a very important rule.  If you find a gun, leave the room immediately and do not touch it.  All right.  Okay.  It's the only rule we have.  Anything else is fair game.  All right.  Emily, where do you want her to start in the house there, Ant?  I think we should start in the parents' bedroom.  All right.  Emily, are you close to your parents' bedroom?  Yeah.  Do you have a cordless phone?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  Go into your parents' bedroom.  Okay.  Do they have end tables on each side of their bed?  Yeah.  Okay.  First, go into Mommy's.  There's only hers.  Oh, there is only hers?  Yeah.  All right.  Open that drawer.  How many drawers are there in it?  Two.  Okay.  Open the top one.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, tell us what's inside there.  Give us a little description of what's in there.  Pills.  Pills?  What's the... 
[01:42:30]  Read off some of this stuff.  What is Mommy taking?  Advil.  All right.  Advil.  Prescription.  What kind of prescription?  What does it say on it?  Oh, they get really good aspirin up there in Canada.  They get the real stuff.  What's the name on the prescription?  It doesn't say.  Just like Shopper's Drug Mart.  All right.  All right.  So she's got a little pills.  A little couple of pills.  Some of that strong aspirin you could get in Canada.  What else?  Just like pens and stuff.  Pens and stuff?  Yeah.  I'm sure there's no thick pens in that drawer. 
[01:43:00]  You know how...  Nah, you've seen them.  Nah.  They're a really thick pen.  What about...  Okay.  What about the bottom drawer?  Yeah.  Let's go to the bottom drawer.  In a minute.  All right.  Did she hang up on us?  Hello?  Well, maybe her parents listened to the show.  She was hanging up.  No, she went to another call.  Well, she probably hit the button when she was fumbling for the drawer.  Fumbling.  She's still there.  She's on another call. 
[01:43:30]  Hey.  Oh, there you are.  All right.  Emily.  Yeah?  All right.  Who was on the other line?  Hmm?  Did you just take a call?  Yeah.  Who was it?  My friend, Cameron.  Oh.  Oh.  Your friend.  All right.  All right.  What's in the second drawer?  Clothes.  What kind of clothes?  I'm not going to go through it.  I don't know what I'll find.  Yeah.  Go through it, though.  Yeah.  Go through it.  That's why you're on the phone with us today.  All right.  No one wants to hear you just doing nothing.  Yeah.  Go through the drawer.  She's out of the house. 
[01:44:00]  She'll never know.  Take a look.  Don't mean that I want to know it, didn't it?  Yeah.  That's probably nothing bad.  We do, though.  Yeah, we do.  And you're our only eyes over there, so kind of give us a description of what you're going  through.  Yeah.  You're going to describe it?  Just old shirts from, like, back when they didn't have a life.  Just old T-shirts?  Old T-shirts.  Are you digging around?  Yeah.  Yeah, those old T-shirts are hiding something.  Let's keep digging.  Yeah.  What's under the old T-shirts? 
[01:44:30]  Red.  Nothing but clothes?  And thread.  Lingerie.  Oh, lingerie.  What kind of lingerie?  What is it, like, see-through stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of gross, isn't it?  Yeah.  Don't want to know about that.  No, you don't.  I bet she had no idea that Mommy has that right there, right next to the bed, huh?  Anything else?  Yeah.  Anything that isn't clothes? 
[01:45:00]  All right.  She's not.  We need a brave little bastard.  More pills?  More pills.  All right.  Read the bottle.  Yeah.  Just, of course, not the name, but read the, uh, what's in it.  Just, like, tablets.  What does it say on the, uh, outside?  Uh.  She doesn't know what the, what, what the, the pills are?  One or two tablets every four hours. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  Really?  Uh, what's the name on the, on the bottle?  Yeah, isn't it?  It's my name.  It's prescription.  It's what?  Prescription.  Yeah, but it doesn't say the name of, like, whatever pill it is, like, Xanax or.  What?  No, the prescription just has, like, when you take it.  It doesn't have a name.  Oh, that's it?  All right, uh, we're done with that.  Now, um, go to your dad's computer.  Yeah.  And look at, uh, recent documents and temp internet files.  Where's your dad's computer?  Can you hack it?  Huh?  Trying to get me to hack it? 
[01:46:00]  No, you're just looking at it.  Just looking.  All right, we're done with Emily.  Yeah.  We need a special little bastard.  Thank you, Emily.  Thank you, Emily.  You did a good job.  Have a good day off.  All right, bye.  All right.  Emily, uh, yeah, she was a little fraidy cat.  Here's our home.  Very timid.  Uh, let's go to Alex in Florida.  Alex!  Alex!  Yeah?  What's going on?  You're home alone?  How you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got that voice.  Yeah, why are you home alone?  Sick?  No, I just, my bus doesn't come for, like, till, like, 8.30. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, really?  And mom and dad are already at work?  Well, technically, my dad's dead on the couch.  He's not going to do anything, so I don't worry about it.  Uh, he's just, uh, passed out on the couch?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, long night for him, huh?  Uh, yeah, he was up all night, like, studying and stuff.  Studying?  And then he wouldn't move.  Studying at the booby bar?  No.  No, he was home.  Playing real or fake?  Uh, all right, Alex, you want to, uh, you want to go up to, to your parents' room there? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, hold on a second.  All right.  Jeez.  We got Alex in Florida.  To the parents' room.  Do a little snooping.  Who knows what we'll find?  Yeah.  It's like a little treasure hunt.  Yeah.  You know how, uh, President Bush does that?  The Easter egg hunt?  Gets little kids on the White House lawn and they gotta search for Easter eggs? 
[01:47:30]  Right.  We have the kids searching for other things.  Now, uh, there's only one rule.  If you find any kind of gun, you are to leave the room immediately and not touch it.  Unless you're into emo music, then, uh, who can blame you?  My dad doesn't own a gun.  What?  My dad doesn't own a gun.  Oh, good.  Good.  Very good.  All right, so, uh, what, what do we got in his, uh, bedroom there?  Do we got some end tables?  Mm-hmm.  Huh?  Bed, kind of.  Yeah, on each side of the bed?  No.  Where?  There isn't, and there's no table. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, there's no, where, where, do they have drawers there where they would keep their stuff?  Like a dresser?  On their desk.  Like, in the bedroom, where would they keep stuff?  The closet.  The closet?  Yeah, let's go to the closet.  All right, open up the closet.  Um, there's no door, but I'm in there.  Oh, you're in the closet with no door.  What the hell are you living in?  That sounds like he, uh, he lives in the closet, so.  Is there anything, um, on the floor of the closet? 
[01:48:30]  Any boxes?  There's a box with some garbage in it.  A box with some garbage in it?  No, it's not garbage.  It looks like a rich-nuff book.  It looks like a what book?  A ripped-up book.  It was my stupid cat.  It's a book.  A book that your cat ripped up in.  Oh.  Anything else in the box?  No?  There's a bottle.  I can't really hear him.  Yeah.  There's, like, a pill bottle.  There's a pill bottle?  All right, what does, uh, what does it say on the pills? 
[01:49:00]  What's, what type of pills?  Um, ephedrine.  Ephedrine?  That's good.  Someone's getting a little weight loss going.  Is mom or dad a little overweight?  Mm-mm.  No?  It's really skinny.  It's really skinny.  Yeah, it's good.  Dad's gotten fat over the last few years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How can you blame him?  He thought it would be different.  Do you have any, uh, brothers or sisters?  Mm-hmm.  All right, uh, you know what we're looking for here? 
[01:49:30]  We want you to do a little snooping there, Alex.  Mm-hmm.  We can't walk you through it.  You're there.  Do a little snooping for us.  Try to find some stuff.  Ransack the joint.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Find something funny.  Yeah, find something good for us, for the radio.  What?  He's being quiet.  Mm-hmm.  His dad's asleep downstairs.  Passed out.  Passed out.  What are you looking through? 
[01:50:00]  I found a folder.  A folder?  This is cool.  What's in it?  I don't know yet.  I can open it.  Open it up.  Yeah, get out of the closet.  Let's open it up the folder so we can hear you better.  Yeah, we can't hear you too good.  Okay, hold on.  All right, found a folder.  Put a tax info. 
[01:50:30]  What the hell are you doing?  Folder must be good.  He forgot he's on the radio.  Ew, it's mom.  Alex.  Alex.  Alex.  Okay, okay, sorry.  What's in the folder?  All right.  Ooh, whoa, freaky ass face.  Some kind of drawing.  Drawing? 
[01:51:00]  What kind of drawing?  Um, like, there's a face, like a big face with some vampire teeth, bloodshot eyes.  This is awesome.  What is it?  I got my draw.  Is it like from your mom or dad?  Do they draw?  My dad.  This is my dad.  Your dad draws?  Nobody used to.  Yeah.  Ah, so you're looking through like your dad's youth.  There's a poem.  A poem? 
[01:51:30]  Could you read a little of it?  Yeah, read the poem.  Black angels.  Black angels crying.  Wow, this is old.  Black angels crying tears of blood, which over me, whenever I go, whisperings of sweet revenge  and promise me death, so I'm painful, they speak of their savior and the angel of death. 
[01:52:00]  Jeez.  This is what...  My dad scares me now.  Your dad's emo.  Nobody used to be.  Not anymore.  Yeah, that was when your dad was like a rocker guy and he probably thought he was going to  be like a rock star and then he got married and had you and all his dreams crumbled.  Yeah, so hence the weight gain.  He goes, that's exactly what happened.  Now he just takes a phedrine every so often and thinks about his youth, pulls out his vampire  drawings and his lyrics.  Angel of tears, man.  Yeah, man. 
[01:52:30]  This one was great.  I remember with me and the band, man.  Black angel.  Black angel, dude.  We're rocking.  It's probably lyrics.  Was he in a band?  Um, no, I don't think so.  Yeah.  You ought to get your friends together and put a band together and start singing your  pops lyrics, man.  I might.  All right.  Anything else, Alex?  Because we have to go for now.  All right.  Yeah, nothing else.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Go to school, you old bastard. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Jesus.  We're going to try one more with a girl that's of age so it could get really, really good.  Well, Liz, hold on here.  Yeah.  We've got to take a break.  But, Liz.  What's up?  Stay right there.  We're going to go to you next.  Okay.  You know what we're looking for, right?  Yeah, of course I do.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  We might have a good one on the line.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I will do you whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're getting ready to bring in H-Cup Jane.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  For Booby Day, the only one that showed up today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're going to do that.  We got a nomination for her story of the month, and we also have Liz, who wants to do some snooping.  What do we do?  What do we do?  Liz.  Let's say we go to Liz.  Liz?  All right.  Liz.  Let's say hi to Liz.  She's in New Jersey.  Liz is 19 years old.  Ah.  19 years old.  Legal tender.  Yes.  Liz, what's going on today?  Hey, not much.  Why are you home?  Because it's snowing out, and I didn't feel like going to work. 
[01:54:00]  Where do you work?  At the SPCA.  Oh, right.  A SPCA?  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?  An animal saver.  You kill the animals?  You put them to sleep?  No, but they do.  I help them carry the dead bodies to the fridge.  Nice.  That would be fun.  Put them in the bags and throw them in there?  Yeah, pretty much.  Like a little Gestapo?  Wonderful.  All right.  You want to do some snooping?  Where's Mom and Dad?  Yeah, Dad's not here, and Mom's at work, so.  Is Dad not here meaning that's a. . . 
[01:54:30]  Not here permanently?  Yeah.  He sees you on the weekends?  No, just permanently.  Oh, wow.  Permanently.  All right, you're going to find some stuff.  Let's go.  My mom gets a little freaky.  I just want to let you guys know that.  All right.  Let's go upstairs.  Yeah.  You know where to look.  Liz knows.  Yeah, I know the drawer, and I'm kind of scared, but I'm going to go through it anyway.  All right, go through it.  Get over your fears, Liz.  Yeah, here we go.  Liz is going into her mom's drawer, and she gets a little freaky.  Oh, it's a lot of lingerie, pliers.  Was Dad an ass?  Yeah, a huge ass, and I hope he's listening right now. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Why was Dad an ass?  He liked to drink and get a little violent, so. . .  Oh, great.  Yeah.  He's going to send you right to the pole.  Oh!  You a good girl?  Are you a stripper, or what?  Uh, no, but it's crossed my mind plenty of times.  Of course.  Where are you from?  You need that attention.  Jersey.  Yeah, Jersey area.  All right, uh, what do you find in there?  You found some lingerie so far?  Yeah, Vagisil.  All right.  Well, that's a medical product that's used in case there's a feminine, they call it feminine 
[01:55:30]  itching.  Yeah.  Oh, pictures.  Pictures.  All right.  Ew!  Oh!  What pictures?  Uh, no, actually, I threw the pictures aside because I found something else, and I'm pretty  sure they're butt beads.  Vagisil and butt beads.  Almost positive.  All right, listen.  A little ring on the end, a little Red Bulls.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to slow down a bit because I don't know what Al's dumping out of it.  All right, I could pretty much describe what she's found. 
[01:56:00]  You found a, just don't say anything about what they're used for, but you found a string  of beads.  Yeah.  And describe the beads.  Uh, okay.  They're red, and they're on this long string, and at the end of the string, there's a little  circle, kind of.  Like, like, so you put your finger through there, like a, you know, a pull start of some  sort.  Oh, that's fun on, like, kid toys.  Yeah, yeah.  Makes it easier to pull.  At least they're really tiny.  That makes me feel a lot better.  That's good.  Yeah, you wouldn't want, like, bowling balls on a chain. 
[01:56:30]  That would be a little.  So.  So.  Yeah, we better, we're going to check back in six months.  Those, that's going to be a whole different chain.  So what else is in there?  Um, pictures.  What are the pictures of?  My mom with this guy in a Speedo, and in front of, like, fucking hors d'oeuvres on the table.  Oops.  Hold on, hold on.  I know you're all pissed off, but.  You know, the pictures don't piss me off as much as the little beads do.  That's kind of disgusting.  I'm glad they're in a bag.  I didn't have to touch them. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, they're in a bag?  Like, you weren't expecting to find that, were you, Liz?  No, not at all.  Yeah.  And there's a picture you curse, but it's mom with a guy, and the guy's wearing a Speedo  in front of what?  A buffet?  Yeah, in front of food.  Maybe they were on vacation or something.  Yeah.  She doesn't go very, very often.  I'm kind of.  No, does she bring guys over a lot?  She's got to lay on.  Ah, sometimes.  Yeah, do you hear things through the walls that you don't want to hear?  Yeah, but she hears things through the walls she doesn't want to hear.  All right, you show her.  Yeah.  That's right.  White or black?  Suture white. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, damn.  Do you really want to get back at Dad and Mom?  No.  Oh, okay.  Just had an idea.  Yeah, we have many ideas.  Plenty of ideas for that.  Anything else in the drawer?  Not really.  Just some fucking...  Oh, boy.  Hey, hey.  You are a potty mouth.  Hey, we need to bring back your dad to slap that potty mouth.  Your daddy needs a few shots of Jack and a backhand you.  Real hard not to slip, and I can't believe I didn't.  Oh, yeah.  You're a good girl.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's about it in Mom's drawer?  Yeah, as much as far as I want to go in there. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  That's the beauty of this thing, too.  Sometimes you find a real brave person, and others are like, you know what?  I have to tap out.  Yeah.  I got to tap out.  Well, that's good.  You found some lingerie, some beads.  Hey, would you open the bag of beads?  Oh, God.  Just do it.  All right.  Hold on.  I shoved it back in there.  Just don't say what they are.  Just open the bag of beads.  I really didn't want to touch it.  Okay.  Can you throw it against a wall?  We love when...  I could go throw it on my brother's bed.  Oh, he's sleeping right now.  How about...  Oh, wait a minute.  Take the beads.  What?  Take the beads. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  Listen.  You can even do it with a tissue.  Grab a tissue, but take the beads out and dangle them in front of your brother's nose  as he's sleeping.  Hold on.  Yes.  Yeah, do that.  It's his birthday, too.  Oh, good.  It's his birthday?  That'd be a happy birthday.  How old is he?  He's 18 right now.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Take the beads out and, like, dangle them in front of his nose.  Make sure it taps under his nose so he wakes up.  You can see he's not facing the right way.  All right.  Happy birthday. 
[01:59:00]  Put them on his nose.  Put them on his nose.  You know exactly what they were.  We hit pay dirt with this thing, huh?  And I'm putting them in his ear, and he's too tired to even care.  Just in his ear.  Rest them on the side of his face.  Just to be silly, rest them on the side of his face.  You can have them.  You're welcome.  You can have them.  How many have not been used?  No.  I don't know if they've been used.  They're moms. 
[01:59:30]  Tell them they're moms.  They're mommies.  Oh.  No, I need those back.  All right.  Get them in the bag and get them back in the drawer.  How great is that?  That's disgusting.  Mother's beads on your face on your birthday.  You dropped them.  Hey, Liz, you just saved the last half hour of radio.  Awesome.  You know what?  That was my goal.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Liz.  Bye.  All right.  We have to get Jane in here, yeah. 
[02:00:00]  I'm just trying to, I'm, I'm, I'm, oh, all right.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to be in Pittsburgh.  Let's take this phone call as we get Jane in, in studio.  What's up, Tracy?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I have a question for Jim Norton.  Go ahead, Eddie.  Um, okay.  So I have tickets for your show this weekend.  Okay.  And I'm so excited.  Thanks.  But, uh, I have a friend who is black and I haven't told him about the tickets yet because 
[02:00:30]  I don't know if it's appropriate.  Yeah, of course.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  We sit him in the back, but I mean, he's more than welcome to come.  Yeah, of course.  No, I'm not a racist.  No, Jimmy, Jimmy's really nice.  He has like a colored section when he performs.  So really, is it in the back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bring your friend.  I'm there at the Pittsburgh Infrared Thursday through Sunday.  Bring your friend.  It'll be fun.  He'll enjoy the show.  The reality is we, uh, we love the shwoogies.  Is he going to have a separate bathroom too?  That'll be fun.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll be fine. 
[02:01:00]  Stop.  All right?  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, Jimmy's shows are for everybody.  Well, I mean.  Yeah.  As long as you're of age.  There you go.  You think it's funny to put a mother's beads on a boy's face?  You'll enjoy my show.  Uh, Jimmy, uh, improv in Pittsburgh this weekend?  Yeah, tomorrow through Sunday.  All right.  We got H-Cup, uh, Jane, in studio.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  What's going on?  I'm nervous.  Why are you nervous?  I don't know.  I've never been in a studio before.  Yeah.  You might want to take your clothes off.  It makes people more comfortable.  How about just my sweater?  Yeah, she, uh, she wore a, uh, like a sweater that kind of like, uh, scoops way down. 
[02:01:30]  Those really aren't perfect though.  I mean, I gotta be honest.  They're really lovely.  I flew to Kansas City for these.  I told you.  I know.  But most people fly to Florida or they get them done here in New York.  I hear there's good doctors here.  Yeah, but they don't make them this big.  What?  Other doctors will not make them this big anymore?  They won't go over a thousand cc's.  Wow.  A thousand cc's.  About 1,400.  Are they hard or soft?  No, they're hard, but they're, you know.  They're, wow. 
[02:02:00]  They're big.  They're big.  They're real big.  Man.  She smells good.  You could have hurt somebody with those.  That is.  I could.  Yeah, walk up to the mic.  Don't be nervous.  Okay.  Why, uh.  Walk up to the mic.  So, what, what size were those, uh, previously?  They were 36 B's.  B's.  Wow.  I started as a B.  So you had the B.  And then, uh, what, what made you decide?  I always wanted them, and my ex-boyfriend would never let me get them.  So as soon as we broke up, I went to the doctor. 
[02:02:30]  And, and they were what originally?  36 B's.  And then I went to a double T.  And I went to a double D.  And then an F.  And now I'm an H.  Are you going to stop at H?  No, I want to go a little bigger.  Wow, you're addicted.  Is he happy?  You want him bigger or no?  You're done.  I honestly don't care.  Okay.  He doesn't care.  Yeah.  That's why I was able to do that.  After double D, I mean, you know, who's, who's keeping track?  Who's counting?  I mean, really. 
[02:03:00]  He just likes them the way they are.  Do you, uh, yeah, we got to get him a mic because I'd like to ask him another question.  They're kind of going crazy.  It's not mine, is it?  I'll take this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, that's your husband?  That's my hubby.  Are you starting to realize she's kind of obsessed with this thing?  Well, we have this whole exhibitionist thing going on, the two of us anyway, so.  Oh, yeah?  If that's what makes her happy and gets her mojo working, that's fine with me.  Do you guys have sex, like, where people could see you?  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And sometimes with other people, so.  Oh.  Oh.  Swingers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, it's such a 1970s word.  All right, so.  You just picture 70s porno mustaches and thatched roofs.  Here's the problem I see with the whole swinger thing.  Like, you're bringing that to the party.  What are you getting in return?  You're not trading up.  Oh, if.  No.  Yeah, well.  You're giving up a lot in this trade, I do believe.  HBO did not do us justice.  You should see what. 
[02:04:00]  What do you mean, HBO?  You were on that?  No, they did that thing where all the fat people were swinging.  Right, yeah.  You see that all the time.  So what do you get in return?  You're giving this up.  I get some really nice stuff in return, man.  It's always a pretty even trade.  Are you guys jealous of that?  That would drive me nuts.  Yeah.  You'd be surprised.  There's no way I could do that.  No way.  You'd be very surprised.  Not even in my.  I surprise myself, actually.  You watch?  It's kind of cool, yeah.  Yeah?  I'm doing my thing and she's doing her thing.  How long have you guys been married? 
[02:04:30]  We're together 10 years.  We're married like four.  And life's great.  I'm not knocking it because I know a lot of people.  I just don't get the mindset.  I get the attraction or the perversion of it, but I couldn't do it out of insecurity.  Do you ever like, say you're hooking up with a girl and she's hooking up with a guy.  What if the guy is just, say, packing?  Like what if it's just a guy and you're like.  Yeah, what is it going to take to get you jealous?  That's a good question.  Honestly, I've never been remotely jealous. 
[02:05:00]  I used to have a wife that nobody wanted to look at, guys.  I mean, she gained 40 pounds on my wedding night and it just started going downhill  on the wedding night.  Yeah.  Freaking night.  You don't get jealous.  You're not one of those guys, right?  It doesn't pay.  Regular marriage, it's a disaster.  But I mean, you guys got to fight like anyone else.  I mean, that never comes into play like.  We have, we, no, we don't.  It actually, we fell into it.  We just went to a party one night.  Someone invited us to check it out and we did. 
[02:05:30]  And we ended up hooking up the first night and it was great.  And I was surprised because I didn't know how I was going to react.  But you don't ever look at her doing that and go, man, she's having like, well, hey,  well, how come you don't react that way with me?  Or why don't you do that with me?  She does do that with me.  We have, we have great sex.  Yeah.  You know, you guys should do it for the pal talk cameras today.  And you watch, you watch her do like everything with the guys.  Does she, does, do you have any limits on what these other people can do with you or no?  I don't know.  I wouldn't, it depends on the situation. 
[02:06:00]  We don't do pain really.  We don't do pain.  Nothing's the pain.  Yeah.  Well, none of that.  But I mean, you could look over and all of a sudden see like she's on the rotisserie or something.  Yeah.  I don't want to give Al too much work, but yeah.  I mean, I've seen her do some interesting stuff.  Yeah.  You're a brave man.  You watch her with like two guys?  Yeah.  I love this guy.  Jesus.  But that's, but if, if, if you have that mindset where it doesn't bother you, I envy that because 
[02:06:30]  you guys are open.  You're just going to have sex with a bunch of different people.  It's the greatest.  But aren't you, this is the question.  Aren't you worried that you go to one of these parties, she's with some other guy and  then she wants the other guy now full time.  None of that comes into your mind ever.  I figure if she falls in love with anyone at first sight, it would be you.  Oh, so.  So, uh, you know, I, you know, it's just one, uh, I don't know.  Did you ever fall in love with, did you ever want to have sex with somebody and then leave  whoever you were with?  It's.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  Mindset.  It's.  It's just sex.  I've been trying to understand this for a while because I, you know, like Patrice talks 
[02:07:00]  about it and others call the show and I'm like, wow, man.  And most couples that are in it are not even, I, I've never heard of anybody in the four  years that we're doing it splitting up.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's rare.  The divorce ratio is, is amazing.  I don't know one happily married, allegedly monogamous couple.  Everyone that does what we do, they have a great thing going.  Here's why I ask my, my buddy, uh, used to swing with his girlfriend and, uh, I had been  in the room with my buddy where I was with a girl and he was with a girl and you just 
[02:07:30]  didn't want him having sex with your girl.  He was a professional.  And, uh, he said that what happened was that with this really good looking couple and, uh,  the girl, his, his girl had, had sex with the guy and the guy was finished very quickly.  And then my friend proceeded to, to teach her class on how to properly wreck a marriage  by, by, and he said the guy was miserable cause he, he, he, he was done so quick and  he's just sitting there and I know my friend's an animal and he's going, and he's just really 
[02:08:00]  an animal or a pirate.  Yes.  It was Captain Crunch.  Um, and he banged this, he really did damage and he said the guy was just really depressed  and they never saw them again.  So that wrecked it.  I guess Jimmy wouldn't like, uh, Anaconda.  Oh, is there a guy named Anaconda?  Anaconda.  Yeah.  That's the, he, we saw him in Jamaica.  That's freaking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a total freak.  His nickname is Anaconda.  For obvious reasons, right?  For obvious reasons.  And did you hook up with Anaconda?  No. 
[02:08:30]  In Jamaica?  In Jamaica.  Oh my God.  Was he Jamaican?  So.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was at the resort.  I don't think he was.  How do you know?  Anaconda's the guy they laugh at in Jamaica.  Anaconda.  That's nothing.  Somebody has to stay for the end of the week.  Is that what he does though with couples?  Anaconda?  Uh, yeah.  There's, there's a segment in the population.  There's, there's a lot of people when you see like a younger kind of hot girl with an  older husband and you know that he, you know, often they can't perform all the time. 
[02:09:00]  So they kind of allow their wife that, you know, that avenue and that happens a lot  down there.  Really?  So like I get to buy her gifts and pay for the trip and he can finish off.  Well, that's a lovely marriage.  She stands the whole flight back.  Cause old Anaconda.  She doesn't even need the overhead for her carry on.  No, I don't want to.  Oh, wow.  Well, so Jacob, Jen didn't show, huh?  No, no, no. 
[02:09:30]  No, but, uh, it doesn't seem to matter.  Well, you're starting booby day though.  We're going to attempt this, uh, again in the near future.  Huh?  And bring some more boobies in.  Well, now that we know what you guys are all about, screw the booby day.  We'll, we'll really hook you guys up.  Great.  Everyone is screaming, bring them over to XM.  They're, they're, they're trying to get us to talk you guys into doing something on  Pal Talk.  We can give you guys your own room in, uh, at the other joint.  Look at, look at their eyes light up.  Would you at least come over there and at least talk about some of this stuff?  Yeah, sure. 
[02:10:00]  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, absolutely.  We're going to do some negotiating.  I do believe.  A little bit.  We certainly are.  Oh, um.  It is.  Do you wow or do you?  Of course I wow.  Oh, cause we had a request that people wanted to see.  Yeah, of course.  Uh, where's the Pal Talk cameras?  Oh, everything's fine.  Should we get a close-up for Pal Talk?  Or, you know, you don't need to.  What should we get?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're very, uh, you're very tan.  Tan all over.  Wow, yeah.  Wow.  She's tan all over.  Hence, hence, wow.  Hmm.  Jumping Jiminy. 
[02:10:30]  Do you get jealous of a guy?  I mean, again, yeah, obviously, you know, you know, but guys must just stare almost rudely.  Yeah.  Uh, none of that bothers you.  Dude, I, like I said, I used to have a wife that nobody wanted to look at.  It was the most miserable 312 years of my life.  It was, and you would just go out and probably cheat a lot and stuff.  Towards the end, I really, I really gave it the old college try, man.  You tried.  I gave it the old college try.  Do you ever take it, let me ask you, this is my insecurity talk, if a guy is staring 
[02:11:00]  at your, at your woman's breasts.  Like this room.  Nah, but this is different because she's showing us, but like, if you're like out, and the guy's  just kind of leery, do you ever take that like he's being disrespectful to you as a male,  like he's not even concerned that you're with her?  No.  I mean, normally, especially when, when she wows, like when we're on the parkway or something,  people, people, people are cool, you know, she, we get the worst reaction from women.  We haven't explained, explain this, uh, she's out there every Wednesday, wowing people that  have wow stickers.  That's gotta just get people like, oh my God, this is the best thing ever. 
[02:11:30]  I would get a wow sticker immediately.  Yeah.  So.  Guys, just got a lot of truckers.  It's like, how many rigs have rolled over after you left?  What the hell was that?  Leaving a flaming wreck behind him as they just laugh.  Right.  Didn't JV and Elvis want to see that?  Yeah, where are those guys?  Is it too late for them or what?  Huh?  Oh, they had other stuff to do?  Oh.  JV and Elvis wanted to take a peek at you because they kind of saw you walking down the hall  and they're like, we gotta see that.  I've seen my Elvis out there.  Oh, okay. 
[02:12:00]  Did you show them anything?  No, I didn't.  He didn't want to have a conversation.  He just wanted to look.  He wanted to look.  He just wanted to look.  All right, we're going to drag these two over to XM.  We're going to see what we can get done with these two today over at XM Satellite Radio.  And Jimmy, you're going to be at...  The Pittsburgh Improv doing my nonsense tomorrow through Sunday.  Very, very good.  Call it nonsense.  It's funny comedy.  And here in New York, we got JV and Elvis next and then Nick's Apollo and then the radio  ship.  How do you feel like doing that?  That's very, very nice of you, Jimmy.  No one can.  And you saved booby day, sort of. 
[02:12:30]  Sort of.  I mean, it's going to get a lot better than this, but, you know, we're not disappointed,  that's for sure.  No party hassle.  We threw all that in a closet for next time.  All right?  H-Cup Jane, everyone.  She's out there wowing like crazy every single Wednesday if you've got a wow sticker on your  car.  It is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Have a great day.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip-Em-Out 
[02:13:00]  Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of wow stickers and two-by-fours.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  It's Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony show!  The Opie and Anthony show!  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  This is where the real fun is.  Let's be honest with each other. 
[02:17:00]  No hold bar.  Yeah, Jimmy and I were having a discussion in the elevator and on the walkover about this couple, H-Cup Jane and her husband, they're swingers.  And, you know, she's got these monster tits, they're huge and obviously a huge turn on and they like to swing.  And I'm trying to understand that.  And I'm trying to understand what goes on in your head because it's the jealousy thing. 
[02:17:30]  This is what Jimmy said, Jimmy's like, say what you said on the elevator and I think it's pretty accurate.  I think most guys think this way on some level.  Like I can picture my girlfriend having sex with someone, not a guy in particular, but I can picture her like in a porno, like being railed by somebody because it's like to see somebody that I love and I'm attracted to being dirty is a sexy concept to me.  But to actually watch her doing it, I could never do.  But the theory of it is hot.  And I think a lot of guys, it depends. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, it's you want a lot or just a little bit of that.  But the jealousy takes over and you would never actually want to see it.  Right.  Even talking about it can get jealous too.  Like it's a weird line you have to walk.  But some of these people don't have that line is what I'm getting.  Like this guy can carry a line.  No, it's so far beyond having a line.  His wife could be just sucking and fucking.  Well, that's what we wanted to get into.  Yeah.  And he's like, eh, doesn't bother me at all.  Because he's looking over from his perch. 
[02:18:30]  I would commit suicide.  Where he's just fucking like banging.  Yeah, I would just fuck that, man.  Like if you had already finished, you go, look, could you stop?  I'm done.  I can't do this.  Do you think there's like a guy that wants to do this or maybe the girl wants to do it more and talks the guy into it.  And then at some point he's just sitting there and watching.  And he just goes, stop it.  Stop it.  You don't want to be crying at the swingers club.  You don't want to be the guy that's going, stop doing that to her.  I thought this was a good idea. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  I had no idea she's a size queen.  You don't want to see a girl fucking.  And as she's being railed properly, you don't want to hear her going, oh, finally.  Finally.  Where the fuck did she learn that?  You're right, man.  Stop coming on her face.  Oh, God.  She likes that too.  Oh, the black guy.  You hear the grunt she gives.  She can only give when someone has passed where you've ever gone depth wise. 
[02:19:30]  The grunt of baby boy hitting bottom.  Oh, like that pleasure grunt.  So true, man.  I would love to hear.  I guarantee that that's happened.  I would love to know if anyone out there has ever swung and had like a bad experience with that.  Because all you hear about is couples like this that have good times.  Right.  But I guarantee you it's not all that.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Not in the last trend.  Good times.  Good times.  Well, you want to hear about the nice stories. 
[02:20:00]  Good times.  Good times.  Carola.  I did actually swing once.  I forgot about that.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  I actually, with a girlfriend of mine.  We swapped very lightly, though, because the other girl's in her period.  So I think my girlfriend and the other girl sucked this guy's dick.  And then my girlfriend, this is 10 years ago, and the girl sucked my dick.  And it was okay, but it did change the relationship a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't wreck it, but it was like, eh, it put an element in there that I didn't care for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, because apparently we got a little info out of him over there at FM. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, we'll get into it some more.  She was, you know, two guys on the rotisserie at one point.  I want to know what he was doing at the time.  Hopefully not on another rotisserie.  By the way, I just want to bring to the discussion that scene in that movie.  Help me out.  Was it bound?  Was it...  Oh, we always talk about that one.  Yeah.  And the guy ends up hanging himself.  Yeah.  He's tied up, and his wife is getting just railed in the bathroom, and the door's open, 
[02:21:00]  and he's checking the whole thing out as he's tied up.  Yeah, they're like being held hostage.  And then his wife, just terrific, puts him over the edge by going, stop looking, you pervert,  and then slams the door.  Slams the door, and she just gets fucked silly.  And it just continues.  Yeah.  And then I think later on in that scene or whatever, he's found hung in the bathroom.  What movie was it?  Bound.  Jennifer Kelly and Michael Madsen were fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Madsen, right, right.  Madsen. 
[02:21:30]  Michael Madsen drags her into the bathroom.  One of the hottest scenes, by the way, in movie history.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Atlanta.  John, what's up?  Hey, man.  My wife and I have been in the lifestyle for about five years, and one time we hooked up  with a couple and didn't realize it at first, but this guy had 11 1⁄4 inches, and they  didn't realize it until afterwards, and I'm kind of like, oh, my God. 
[02:22:00]  You know, this guy put the...  But he only could go, and he'd go so far against the woman, and he's only, like, so deep.  Yeah, he couldn't get 11 1⁄4 in there.  Did she like banging him, though, or did she like banging him?  Uh, he actually, lucky for guys like me, average Joe, this guy was a minute man.  He barely got in there, and bam, blew his load, so she...  I was scared of saying, well, she didn't put enough quarters in for the horse ride.  You know, like out in front of Walmart, I got a little quarter horse. 
[02:22:30]  All right, let's...  Yeah, we got it.  All right.  Yeah, the question for you, so obviously he's a lot bigger than you, and that doesn't bother  you.  No, because I have seen guys try to do what I'm able to do to my wife.  I know the buttons to push, and, you know, every woman says she has her own combination,  and I can make my wife climb the wall.  I can make her squirt and just soak the bed.  Really?  Where I see guys try to do it, but they can't do it.  Now, I have watched other ladies go down on my wife, and, of course, you know, she's climbing 
[02:23:00]  the walls and squirting all over the place.  Sounds like this guy's jerking off as he tells us.  Yeah, man.  Every woman does have her buttons, though.  That's her combination, right?  That's also.  Yeah.  My girlfriend said her combination is size and melanin.  All right, thank you, John.  John from Atlanta.  Yeah, the movie's The Getaway.  It's coming in like crazy.  Oh, I'm bound.  I'm sorry.  Thanks for helping us out, guys, on the Instant Feedback.  Here's a bad swinger story from Keith in Florida. 
[02:23:30]  Keith, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Yeah, we've been in the lifestyle for a while, also.  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test.  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system. 
[02:24:00]  If this had been an actual emergency, the tones you just heard would have been followed  by additional information or instruction.  We now return to your XM programming already in progress.  The lifestyle.  I like how they call it the lifestyle.  So, wait, dude, you stopped fucking her.  You stopped, right? 
[02:24:30]  Well, yeah.  Well, during the fight, I did.  After he left and she was crying and stuff, what did you guys do?  We comforted her.  And then we fucked the shit out of her.  Did you continue the threesome?  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  So, her husband left in a rage and she stayed there and got fucked?  Absolutely.  He left her there for about six hours.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty good.  Wow.  And then what did she say about the fight? 
[02:25:00]  Did she indicate why he had freaked out?  A little bit.  Yeah, she said she was the one that was really wanting to do this and she had, you know, kind  of, oh, well, we needed to help our relationship out, you know, to get that good feeling between  us again.  And then I guess he really wasn't into it and that, he wasn't really prepared to see  me balls deep in her.  Well, he was probably lying.  She was probably lying.  It wasn't about getting them closer.  It was about he wasn't fucking her probably.  All right.  Hold on.  I got to stop the show. 
[02:25:30]  We got to help everybody out.  It's coming in like crazy.  Stupid emergency alert system.  That's right.  Satellite radio starting that crap.  And it went off right in the middle of the best part of this fucking story.  It's coming in like crazy.  Can't they do that at like one in the morning or something?  So someone out there has got to tell us what you missed or up to what point and then we'll  back up a little bit.  Because I guess it was right at a great, great part of the story.  Why the fuck can't they let us know they're going to do that? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, we should get a signal that says you're going to emergency alert in like 10 seconds.  We're boring three out of the five hours, you know, we finally got something hot going  on and they fuck it up.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Where were we?  Please repeat this story.  Weekly test of EBS didn't hear story.  How long?  It was a 45 second test.  All right.  What part fucker?  What part did you miss?  We'll help you guys out.  Somebody.  Pal talk.  Anybody.  Yeah.  I don't want them to tell the whole story again.  They're saying you got to start from the beginning. 
[02:26:30]  Just start over.  It's fine.  I mean, what?  Start over.  All right.  That's what people are saying.  Pretty much the whole fucking thing is coming in like crazy.  All right.  Listen, we got.  All right.  Fuck it.  If no one heard it, it doesn't matter.  We'll do it again.  All right.  It's Keith in Florida.  Let the Keith, you know, bad swinger story.  A guy ran out crying.  Yeah.  Him and his wife were new to the lifestyle and they.  They thought it was a good idea, right?  This would spice up their marriage.  Yeah.  That was their plan. 
[02:27:00]  And he got into some major jealousy issues, started screaming at her.  Now, was he nude when all this was going down?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Nude.  Probably nude with a heart on and all of a sudden he's crying realizing this wasn't a good idea.  As he shakes when he cries, his ball bag goes back and forth.  I bet he didn't have a heart on either.  I bet his dick was fucking limp and he was uncomfortable and he had an appendix scar.  Yeah, he wasn't able to get with my wife.  He couldn't get it up to save his life.  But, yeah, he left the house naked with his clothes under his arm, just ran out of there 
[02:27:30]  and she left her there for about six hours.  All right.  So, you guys.  All right.  Wait.  Because, you know, this is good because we didn't get all the details.  So, you guys go to this house.  You're in a room.  You're ready to, you know, to do some swinging.  He's naked and he can't get hard for your wife?  Correct, correct.  Yeah, she was.  And you had no problem.  And obviously you had no problem.  And now the guy's starting to realize, holy shit, my wife's going to get railed here.  I'm new to this and I can't perform. 
[02:28:00]  Now I'm thinking there's a bad idea.  The jealousy's taking over.  He's naked and he starts crying.  Oh, yeah.  He's crying, screaming.  I mean, he came up screaming over my shoulder because I was actively fucking her when he started.  Oh, God.  He's actively fucking her.  And did he say, I want to go, and she said no?  What happened with that?  Well, he started screaming at her about the whole, you know, this sucks.  You can't do this.  We can't do this.  And, you know, yada, yada, yada.  She screamed back a little bit and... 
[02:28:30]  What'd she scream?  Um, you know, well, pretty much that, you know, that their marriage was falling apart  and that, you know, they didn't have sex more than once every day.  Oh, this was having an argument and you're fucking her.  Well, I mean, I stopped after a few strokes into the argument.  It's kind of hard to keep you constantly doing it.  Yeah, but you didn't stop right away, though.  Did you keep your voice down there, fella?  Yeah, you're spoiling the mood here. 
[02:29:00]  She's going to fuck this girl, Hendry.  So he wanted to leave, and she was like, she was indicating she wanted to stay.  Well, she was indicating that it was there, it was good for their marriage, and that's  why they were doing it.  And they screamed back and forth, and he just grabbed his clothes and walked out of the  house naked in a huff.  All right, so now this is the best part.  So she's like, fuck him.  She didn't obviously follow him out of the house.  So what happened right after the guy left with his clothes?  She was boo-hooing for a bit, and we both comforted her, calmed her down a little bit, 
[02:29:30]  and then we both went to town on her.  I guarantee you...  My wife's a good girl.  That guy was driving around checking his cell phone every few seconds if she was texting  him.  We're checking his phone, and meanwhile, she had a fucking box on her face and a dick deep  in it while he's riding around putting his undershorts on backwards.  Just hoping, hoping, just checking his phone every five seconds.  What did she get at the top?  He probably circled the block, seeing if she was coming out of the house for the next six  hours.  Oh, man. 
[02:30:00]  Dude.  Oh, that's a good story.  We have a clip of him leaving the house.  Yeah.  I'm not good.  Yeah.  I'm not good.  Not E-Rock.  Hey, dude, do you think that if he would have said to his wife, in that argument, look,  I want to go right now, if he would have said, let's go, she probably would have left  or if she would have stayed.  And she probably, yeah, I think she probably would have left because she was dead generally  in the mindset, or at least that's how she was deluding herself, that this was going to  fix up their marital problems.  And, you know, it was just that he walked out of the house in a big huff that she didn't 
[02:30:30]  go with him.  You ever see them again or hear from them again?  No, no, not at all.  We try to avoid drama.  Drama and the lifestyle don't go real well together.  All right.  Thanks, man, very much.  Yeah, we got to give some more couples some time here.  Let's say hi to Henry in North Carolina.  Henry, what's up?  Henry.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Love the show.  I've been listening since NEW.  Oh, thank you.  Listen, man, there's not many problems in the lifestyle because it's all about the rules. 
[02:31:00]  The rules are set up long before anything happens.  Okay, what do you mean?  You mean like, you know, you go in, there's like soft swap or full swap, and if you're like  a soft swap couple, meaning like no sex, and you go stick your dick in a girl's ass, that's  where all the problems arise.  Soft swap.  But a soft swap, does that cover, now I know full swap is full swap.  Soft swap.  There's a full swap.  Is that like just oral sex and petting?  Yeah, pretty much.  Anything but penetration.  Yeah, but the whole rules thing is hilarious because even like the NBA has rules, and you 
[02:31:30]  know, all of a sudden you get a game where it's all hell breaks loose, and people in  the stands are getting punched, and people are getting beer thrown on them, and you know,  the ref's getting knocked out.  You're licking tits, and Ben Wallace is balls deep in your head.  Stupid rules.  Sometimes they don't save the day.  Well, sometimes the rules are bad, too.  Like one time my wife and I were in Vegas, and we had our rules, and we did what we did,  and I'm in the middle of a double penetration with another woman and a man, and my wife's 
[02:32:00]  with another guy, but this guy couldn't get it up.  So rather than, you know, rules are rules, so I finished what I was doing, and now I owe  my wife one.  So I gotta wait, you know, she's gotta pick up a guy and do what she's gotta do while I  sit idly by and wait.  Oh, wow.  See, that's kind of weird.  Like, shouldn't that be that that's just the luck of the draw?  Yeah, but you know, it's kind of like you want to end up on an even playing field, you  know, because I think the jealousy arises where someone's sitting in the background with 
[02:32:30]  their dick in their hand and their wife's having a ball.  I think that's kind of where the problems start.  You know, if you mix the rules with an even playing field, I mean, my wife and I have  been in a lifestyle for like six years now, and never had a problem, except for the guy  not being able to get it up.  You know, so it's all about, I mean, me and my wife went in with the rules and have, you  know, have adhered to them, and have never had a problem.  And honestly, I've been with some of the hottest women I've ever been with in my life, in this 
[02:33:00]  lifestyle.  You ever get jealous watching your wife be fucked by a guy with a bigger dick?  You know what's funny?  I thought I would.  I really thought I would.  And when it all happened, no.  Because it just turned out at the same time.  Give me that.  I don't think I'd be with this guy.  Well, wait, don't you?  Sorry.  You didn't think like this guy's fucking my wife with a bigger dick, like she's going  to crave that?  Like the next time you fucked her, were you thinking, I bet you wish, like my dick was  that guy's dick?  No, you know what?  I use that as motivation.  Fuck it three times as hard as that guy ever could. 
[02:33:30]  And it's all good.  Maybe there's guys out there that aren't as immature as we are.  Yeah, apparently so.  Because that's...  We laugh for a half hour over my shit fumes making someone grow up.  Maybe we've got to realize that we're pretty damn immature.  He's got a bigger dick than me.  My girlfriend told me my outlook...  I'm sorry, but hold on.  My girlfriend told me my outlook on dick size is juvenile.  And she said it's juvenile.  What are you thinking about this guy's dick size?  What's the matter with you?  I don't care about that.  When you're white for girlfriends with a girl, you know, 
[02:34:00]  with a guy, and, you know, she's doing what she's doing,  you know, you're also doing the same thing.  So it's not like you're standing there staring at her  like you're watching a movie.  You're off doing your own thing.  Maybe, you know, in the same room or different room, whatever.  So it's not like you think it is.  It's not like you're sitting there staring at her going,  wow, he's got eight inches and he's putting it in her ass.  You know, you're just...  You're kind of off doing your own thing.  No way, dude.  I couldn't do it.  All I'd be looking at is my girlfriend and thinking,  you fucking bitch, I could not do it.  You're a better man than me.  I could talk about it and fantasize about it, 
[02:34:30]  but it could never just go beyond there.  Yeah.  I never thought I'd be able to do it, man.  Honest with you, it all started.  My wife was watching the Yankee.  I was watching the Yankee game.  My wife comes up to me and says,  hey, listen, I want to be with another woman.  Let's swing.  And I was like, yeah, okay, bullshit.  And here we are six years later.  Wait a minute.  Ann said no way.  You couldn't even fantasize about it  or you mean to the lifestyle?  No, the whole lifestyle thing is like, stop.  Could you fantasize about it or talk about it, though?  Like in theory, just to be dirty?  No, I never have.  I don't like...  Doesn't it know your thing? 
[02:35:00]  No, it doesn't float in my boat.  Yeah, man.  It's not for everybody.  I'll tell you that much.  No, but I couldn't actually do it.  But to think about it, I guess,  because I'm a perv.  Like, yeah, I can see my girlfriend being pornographic.  I'm a dirtbag.  Hey, let's go to...  Thank you, sir.  We're going to Brian the Trucker.  Brian, what's up?  Brian.  Brian.  What are you hauling today?  Nothing right now.  I'm fucking empty.  Larry, stop, Brian.  Oh, hi, Larry.  All right.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  All right, listen up, right? 
[02:35:30]  Here's a good one.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, I do security work on the side, you know?  Yeah.  I got this gig down at Daytona for bike week.  We all know about bike week.  There's a lot of whores down there, you know?  Sure.  So this dude comes in with his girlfriend, cute little bitch, got these chaps on with  no fucking shorts underneath, right?  So she's talking to me, talking, talking, bullshit.  He says, yeah, let's go upstairs and back.  I thought he was joking around.  His girlfriend's like all four, man.  Every time I go down there now, I hit this bitch. 
[02:36:00]  Now, her husband or her boyfriend or whatever the hell he is, he pays me so he can sit  there and watch her.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  And then, dude, it's fucking insane.  It's insane.  I was a little nervous about it at first, but like that guy said, there are rules, man.  You know?  And apparently, this dude likes that stuff.  Is this Bill Burr?  That's what?  Is this Bill Burr?  Hello? 
[02:36:30]  You there?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  You got to speak up.  I'm in the truck now.  Fucking Bill Burr!  It's fucking Bill Burr!  You're good.  You are good.  Yeah, dude.  And I do security work for this private fucking swingers party in Manhattan.  And part of my payment is the guy that throws the party, his wife, or his girlfriend, blows  me.  And that was a little funky at first because, you know, it was a little more personal, but  whatever.  It works.  The money's good. 
[02:37:00]  No, now it doesn't sound like him.  Now it doesn't sound like him.  It's good before.  Is this Bill Burr?  That'd be funny.  And now he's hanging up.  I think that was Bill Burr, man.  Play back the tape.  It wasn't Bill Burr?  No.  No.  No way.  It sounded like him for a second.  They had a little Bill Burr in him.  That guy doesn't have a bad swinger story.  I want to hear bad ones.  I mean, the good ones are there's a million people with great ones.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in Florida.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, this is Dan.  I had this Cuban girl, right? 
[02:37:30]  And I've always tried to get her to bring in another girl.  Well, I show up at her house, and she's got a Puerto Rican little girl there for us.  So I'm sitting back watching them, and she's going to town, eating the Puerto Rican girl out.  And I decide to get behind her.  And next thing you know, the Puerto Rican starts cussing in Spanish.  And it just got weird from there.  She was just, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the girl would turn around for me and her pussy and look back at me.  And the Puerto Rican little girl there. 
[02:38:00]  What was the problem?  Don't listen to yourself.  Well, she would look back at me and just tell her to be quiet until the Puerto Rican begins.  She'd go back to eating the pussy, and it was just wild.  It was wild.  All right.  I mean, good for you.  You had a fun time.  I want disasters.  I'm not interested in hearing great fuck stories.  Everyone's got great fuck stories.  Hey, did I tell you the time my girlfriend was 69 last week?  And we came into each other's mouths together.  Who gives a hoot?  I want to hear about a fucking crying cuckold running out of the house 
[02:38:30]  while a whore stays there and gets fucked.  Or she's driving around in his fucking underpants in the snow,  fucking looking for her text messages.  And she's got a cock in her mouth.  That doesn't tell you all you need to know about fucking marriage.  Try being a man and needing some emotional support.  I can't do this.  It's going to save our marriage.  Circle the block, cuckold.  Circle the block.  Jesus Christ.  And if women can play, we don't understand their needs. 
[02:39:00]  Your husband can't get it up for another woman.  You're being fucked and he's crying and leaving the house.  And you stay there and boo-hoo a little and then have your ass eaten by two strangers.  Do you think that marriage fared?  Horrible.  Here's what happened.  She got in the truck.  They didn't say a word for a while.  He drove, fucking staring straight ahead, wanting to ask her details.  And she's like, I don't want to talk about it.  Look, why did you leave?  And then eventually it came out and he's like, you enjoyed it, didn't you?  That got ugly.  That got ugly, yes.  Could have ended in a murder.  Nah, probably a murder. 
[02:39:30]  He probably just jerked off a lawn on the cold bathroom floor.  He's deep down in a faggot.  He liked the guy's dick and that's why he couldn't get it up.  Because he was with the wrong woman.  Just my theory.  What do I know?  Just a silly boy with no-greens.  But yeah.  Jeez.  Alright, hey, you want to talk to H-Cup?  Yeah, sure.  Let's get a mic out there.  So they followed us over to XM here.  Yeah.  It's good, right, Billy?  Fucking A, this is good.  Healthy for a boy.  What do you got?  Yogurt and granola and some straw berries. 
[02:40:00]  And what?  Blueberries.  They're making a comeback.  Blueberries.  Alright.  Hey, guys.  Are you enjoying the stories?  We're enjoying them.  I have one bad one for you.  Wow.  We were away again in Jamaica and met this couple.  Thought they were hot.  We both attracted to both people.  Bring them back to the room.  And he's getting ready to give me the high hard one. 
[02:40:30]  And I hear her say, oh, I don't do penetration.  So the rules, as you were talking about earlier.  Tit for tat.  You can't.  You got to let us know.  You got to let people know ahead of time what you're into and what you're not.  But he kind of forgot to tell us that.  So he was ready to go ahead.  So I stopped him dead straight.  Told him to get up and out.  If he would have slid his mule inside, I would have broken every bone in his body.  Wow.  It's just such bullshit.  It really is.  Like she at the last minute, his girl said no penetration. 
[02:41:00]  I think he just had her along so he could get laid.  Right.  Basically.  So there are some of those stories.  But the parties are great.  Who knew that was going on?  The costume parties are great.  Costume parties.  That's a lot of fun.  Oh, no, no, no.  A lot of fun.  You have little theme nights.  I love that.  Guys dress regularly and girls.  Guys don't dress up.  Girls get to do their stripper wear.  It's really kind of cool.  That's great.  You're banging a guy in a Batman mask named Gus. 
[02:41:30]  I like getting blowjobs from guys in bunny suits.  While my girlfriend runs around with a knife looking for our fucking mullet-haired son.  I just say, great party.  That's what it was about.  He thought that fucking his wife was fucking Scatman Crothers who was running around with  an axe.  How do you know you guys will be really jealous until you...  How do you know?  Until you're in that situation.  Because my girlfriend...  My girlfriend told me she dated...  She was telling me about her ex-boyfriend's dick when I asked. 
[02:42:00]  It was a big dick.  And I wanted to put my face in the pillow and just cry and have a drink.  Have a drink, huh?  Uh-oh.  And I didn't even ask.  She's like, why do you want to know that?  She was trying to spare me the fucking humiliation.  Wow.  Hey, can we get something going with you two today?  We got PalTalk cameras.  I don't know where.  Well, they already put down the shades in our office.  Is there a camera in there?  Look, they're hoping.  You rock radio.  All right, let me pop up a E-Rock radio and see what's going on over there. 
[02:42:30]  I love the new version of PalTalk that's almost impossible to get video up on.  It is harder, right?  Wow, look at that.  That's the office and there's the...  They set up a set.  The bed's in there.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a whole set.  It's like, yeah.  Why don't you guys, I don't know, maybe go in there.  Let's really give the old PalTalk a shakedown. 
[02:43:00]  Why don't you just go in there?  Go in there.  See what develops.  Yeah, let's just see what develops.  No pressure whatsoever.  You'll be totally alone.  Totally alone.  We need mics too, though.  That's it.  There's a camera, you know.  All right, I'm going to go off mic.  By the way, we have a nice studio audience today.  I'm sure you guys are glad you picked today, right?  With dad in tow.  That's a dad? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Are you a sister or a boyfriend or a girlfriend?  Get that cam mic on in that room.  Boyfriend, girlfriend, and dad.  They picked off mic.  I have a swap idea.  Lock the sound.  Huh?  Lock the sound.  What happened?  On that mic.  Oh, okay.  There it is.  Okay.  Very good.  Can we hear it too?  Stop.  I think we can.  Yeah, I'm going to leave this mic on in here.  Yeah, do that.  Just on the desk.  Be funny if just he's about to come, Steve runs in in that faggity scarf and wrecks everything.  Well, Steve is in there with E-Rock.  This wasn't what we were hoping for. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, what?  Yeah.  They're going to swing.  Oh, if he's going to leave a mic on in there, then I can just take this.  Don't mind me.  I'm just sitting up so the people can have a good time also.  All right.  That's not our job.  You know, there's people out there that get mad when you do this.  Hey, go fuck them.  Because you're catering to a couple hundred people on PalTalk instead of the million people  that are listening to the radio show.  But the million people got to understand. 
[02:44:30]  PalTalk people have flashed their tits.  They don't want to have sex on PalTalk.  They don't have to.  So we can turn off PalTalk.  Can you guys, how about with no camera?  How about you put masks on?  You like costumes.  What kind of masks do we have around here?  We got to negotiate.  If you have masks on, no one knows who you are.  I think there's a yellow wrestling mask around here somewhere.  Yeah, right?  How can they not want to have sex?  All right, give them the mic.  Their jobs, maybe.  Their jobs, maybe.  We got to negotiate.  Why not on PalTalk? 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  We've just never done anything on film before.  Well, we have our own film.  Your own film.  Well, you guys said you're into the voyeuristic thing.  People are piling into this room.  Oh, my God.  It is.  They're piling in.  Like they're calling each other.  Like today's the day to get in this room.  What about with masks?  This is like the first time somebody offered me a cigarette, man.  All my friends are watching and I feel like a complete douche.  Oh, how about with masks on? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  How about a mask?  How about if we blur the camera?  How about we blur the camera a little bit?  I am absolutely dreading not being able to get put on.  A lot of people recognize me, though.  Wait a minute.  How about this?  How about if the camera is aimed below a certain level?  If you can't get a rod, so what?  If the camera is aimed below a certain level, would your faces not shown?  There's only about 700 people in pal talk right now.  It's like blowing up.  If the camera is aimed at a certain level, I mean, would that be? 
[02:46:00]  Like the ceiling?  We've got to negotiate a little bit here.  They're setting up the set and everything.  It looks very nice.  It's a lot of effort going into this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've got costumes and everything.  Yeah, costumes.  All right, we've got a mask for you.  Try on the mask.  I feel like a mask too big.  Yeah, why don't you try the...  Just at least put the mask on.  Let's see.  Give it a whirl.  Let's see.  H-Cup Jane is putting on the Mardi Gras type mask.  All right, let me see. 
[02:46:30]  No one will ever know, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And then the other guy...  Wow, that'll be freaky, man.  And the other guy...  Could you eat pussy in that?  What is that mask?  That is really creepy.  How do you explain that?  It's like a...  I think you have it on backwards.  It looks like a devil type...  It looks like a little red riding hood without a face.  Yeah, it's got no face with like some kind of fiery tongue thing hanging out.  Oh, cool.  Okay, that's where I draw the limit.  All right.  You can put on one of those like...  You want the African mask or you want the Mardi Gras mask? 
[02:47:00]  We got masks.  Or you can put a paper bag on your head.  A paper bag.  He likes this one better.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, you like the African mask.  But we want to make sure you guys are completely covered.  Then no one knows what the hell.  They really don't.  There's a million girls that have boobs as big as you.  Who are you kidding?  How about a paper bag, Steve?  A paper bag.  A paper bag.  I love it.  Nice.  What do you think?  It's up to you. 
[02:47:30]  You think that'll keep you protected?  Will that work, bud?  You think that'll work?  We'll give it our best shot.  All right.  I think paper bag, though.  Give it a shot.  Yeah.  No pressure.  Look, if you can't get a rod, so what?  It is a lot of pressure and it's not planned.  Yeah.  I think you need...  I'm going to be...  I got to be honest with you.  I think you need more of a mask.  Mask.  So you feel like, you know, well protected.  No one's going to know you, dude.  I mean, you're set.  Why don't you have his name tattooing with a cop? 
[02:48:00]  You brought a little sandwich bag, you nincompoop.  What?  That's not going to fit on her head.  All right.  Let's try it.  Are you insane?  Why don't you bring a clear plastic bag?  Here's some saran wrap.  Just duct tape it around your neck.  Where's the pig mask?  What is that?  That's a small bag.  Where's the pig mask?  That would never fit over her head.  It actually had to get returned to its owner.  What?  Yeah, somebody said, I need that back.  For what?  By a rapist in a pig mask bag?  Yeah.  We only have 700 people in Pal Talk. 
[02:48:30]  Give or take a couple hundred.  Either way.  I don't know.  I'll bang a girl on Pal Talk.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A girl or your girlfriend?  No, a girl.  A girl.  Yeah.  And it's for the show, so that should be all right.  I told my girlfriend, like, if I fuck you on the show, it's acceptable.  And she went, oh, you're a card, James.  She'd spit right in my fat face.  Of course she would.  That guy, we've been talking about Pal Talk for years.  Let me just explain.  H-Cup Jane and dude, let me explain something. 
[02:49:00]  We've been talking about Pal Talk for well over a year, maybe close to two years at this  point.  It took today for this guy.  He said, damn, you guys are getting me to download Pal Talk right now.  Yeah.  I wonder how many people are trying.  I've got to get it now.  Oh, my God.  Wait, there is something sexy going on, though.  Where's that camera?  Is that camera on in the room?  Yeah, this is the one in the office.  What are you talking about?  All I'm saying is E-Rock.  Jimmy's making me look at the camera.  He said that something sexy is going on on camera right now. 
[02:49:30]  Which one?  E-Rock Radio, right?  All right.  I'm looking at the E-Rock Radio camera that's set up in our office.  And Jimmy's saying something sexy is going on there.  I don't really.  Oh, God.  No.  Don't spread the cheeks.  Jimmy, that ass has had some abuse today.  Oh, my God.  This fucking, he took a dump.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What?  Isn't that sexy? 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Wait, you're good with the Mardi Gras mask?  Yeah, I'm fine with the Mardi Gras mask.  Yeah, that's a nice mask.  You can't see who it is.  All right.  You know, you guys talked a good game, you know.  You can't come to the Opie and Anthony show and talk a good game.  We'd love to see some action.  We're going to call you out on that.  I don't know.  Love to see a little action.  We're calling.  Do the best you can.  Dude, that's all.  Just enjoy it.  There's no pressure.  Yeah, have fun.  You know what?  I don't want to, this bit sucks.  Liz is old enough to have her own toys fucking lame bit.  Oh, Chicago's an hour behind. 
[02:50:30]  Oh.  God, wow.  That came out of nowhere.  I'm like, Liz, who?  You're an hour behind.  All right.  Don't screw.  Can I take a leak?  Yeah, I got to pee, too.  And you want to just keep the show going?  Well, you want to take a break, let them kiss a little bit, and get started.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and, you know, close the door.  Get a mic in there.  We'll make a pee.  Yeah.  Have Sam stand there just to fucking inspire you.  Hey, Dad.  Tell him not to get started, though, yet.  Take a quick break.  Dad, enjoying the show?  Are you going to be in?  He's like, great, guys.  Thanks.  A lot. 
[02:51:00]  Picked a good day to check out the show live.  Even though we're not doing the walkover live on the radio, we still invite the audience  to come in and check out the show.  Make sure they know not to really get things going.  Yeah.  Quick break, and then we'll see H-Cup Jane and the dude in action, hopefully, for a little  bit.  We'll see how far they are brave enough to take this.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  Massive hooter.  I'm very proud of my big tech.  Thank God for Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[02:51:30]  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  All right.  We're back.  We got H-Cup Jane.  By the way, this girl is out there wowing all the time.  That's how we met her.  She started calling us up.  She was kind of bummed out that she wasn't seeing a lot of wow stickers out there because  she really, really wanted to flash, but she knows the rules.  She only flashes guys that have the wow stickers and the wow signs and stuff. 
[02:52:00]  And then she finally came in today, and yeah, she's definitely all right.  She's got massive breast implants.  Juicy, spankable hiney, and she's sexy because she's got this really just dirty girl vibe  to her.  Yeah, and we learned that she swings with her.  Are they married?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Together for 10 years.  Couldn't figure that out.  Oh, together for 10 years.  And the guys, you know, they were talking a big game, so we're like, all right, well,  let's see what you can do.  And they were very, very scared, so we got them some masks, and now they're in our office, 
[02:52:30]  and here goes the-  And something's going on.  Play-by-play.  Yeah.  Oh, her shirt is off.  I know that much.  She's taking her shirt off.  I better go over there and watch it.  Yeah, Jimmy, why don't you get a microphone?  Can I have a cordless mic for someone?  Can one of the gang help me?  Yeah, Jimmy, you're going to have to help us out because what we're watching on Pal Talk  is a little different because we don't see her boobs even though she's topless at this  point.  There's a couple couches in the office that they could choose from.  They got the leather couch. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  That would be the move, but they also have that other thing.  They ought to use it.  What is that other thing from the sponsor thing?  The thing.  The Terminator?  The Liberator.  The Liberator.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  But now-  All right.  She's now sitting down with her Mardi Gras mask on.  She's on the Liberator.  Oh.  And the guy's pants, definitely undone.  He just took a superhero position, so I do believe she is sucking his cock.  We have a little dick sucking going on there. 
[02:53:30]  A little dick sucking.  God damn it.  I can't see him.  I'm trying to peek.  Jimmy's trying to peek.  Effective curtains, though.  Where's the dick sucking?  Excuse me.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a nice camera angle.  Yeah.  We're looking at his fucking pants pulled out a little bit.  Is there any way?  Can they hear us in there?  No.  No.  There's no way.  You know what, though?  You got it.  What do you want to see?  His cock?  No.  Well, you want to see her.  Yeah, but I mean, I'm sure you'll see her.  I do want to see his cock in her mouth.  Not like freestand. 
[02:54:00]  That's a very jaded question, Ant.  You'll see in a minute, I'm sure.  What we're pretty much seeing is his back.  That's it.  Oh, there's a boob popping out.  This movie has a good dynamic.  All right.  We got a boob.  We got the Mardi Gras mask covering her face because she doesn't want anyone to know what  she's doing.  This movie has a good dynamic to it.  See, it starts off and you're kind of like, hey, hey, we can't see.  And people get all, like, freaked out.  And then maybe they'll turn around.  Are they mic'd in there?  Is that good?  Yes.  Yes.  Is she asking us a bit?  No, ask her to sit facing her. 
[02:54:30]  Tell them to turn a little bit.  Oh, well.  All right.  There's the shot you wanted.  There's your cock, Jim.  It's a blowjob.  Now we got some cock.  Somewhere in between would have been nice.  You want to see the blowjob.  You guys act like I'm queer if you want to see a blowjob.  It's not like he's standing there alone doing jumping jacks.  I'm like, turn around, fella.  There's a fucking mouth on his cock and it's hers.  And I wanted to see it.  Someone has to say it.  This is legal, right?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  A girl in a weird bird Mardi Gras mask is blowing a man. 
[02:55:00]  And he seems to be doing fine.  And they call us smut peddlers.  Why is Stalker Patty looking at this like she's, like, look, like she's looking up, I don't know, like.  Oh, no.  I saw sexier faces studying the Manhattan Project than what she's looking at right now.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  She shouldn't do that.  You don't know where it's been.  We got 900 people on Pal Talk.  900 now.  This is live on Pal Talk.  People are signing up like crazy.  Yeah, well, there's, she's on her knees with her Mardi Gras mask on. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Can they hear us?  No.  No.  Something dropped.  How's he getting a rod on Pal Talk?  I'm talking about 900 people.  You've got to respect that.  That's, uh, yeah.  Oh, between the tits.  Put it in the tits.  Well, she's taking her jeans off now.  Here we go.  And the pants are coming off.  She's got a huge, uh, tramp stamp on the back right above her panty line.  The pants are coming off.  Uh.  Both of them having a little, uh, trouble getting them over her shoes, I think. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't want to lose that rod, I'm sure.  What?  She's, they can't hear us.  They can't hear us.  She can talk.  She's got a nice big boot.  They're not, uh, they're not hearing us.  Huge H-cups.  Massive H-cups.  My cock right now in front of all these people, it would be a fucking, it would be, like, it  would be so soft, it would be standing up straight.  She's taking her socks off, too.  All right.  She's taking the socks off.  She's got the tiny little red panties on.  The largest size.  And the panties are coming down.  And, uh, are they? 
[02:56:30]  No.  There you go.  Maybe she didn't have to work up to it.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, there go the panties.  The panties are down.  Say goodbye to the red panties.  She's now leaning back on the liberator.  It's on the liberator.  There he goes.  Guy is taking position.  Look at his fucking little red riding hood mask.  And.  Everyone's yelling, it's in the hole.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Now let's listen in.  Now we gotta shut our fucking traps.  Ooh.  Oh, yes. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Sit down.  What's that?  Oh, yes.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Her legs are in the air. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  There's a giant sock-headed man fucking a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She seems to be answering the question, uh, yes.  Oh.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, me.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, the red mask on.  That is pretty funny.  Oh.  Oh, I like this.  No two-pump chump here.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real deal.  Come on to town.  This guy plays.  This guy plays in the majors.  Doing a good job.  Yeah.  Very good job by a little red riding hood dude.  Jimmy, go in there and stick your cock in his ass.  No, I wouldn't go for that at all.  As he, uh, I wouldn't go for that at all.  I don't care for that. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Uh, she's not happy with the mask.  Oh.  I'd love to swim walk by them right now on camera.  Uh-huh.  All right.  They're not really...  They're Mike.  That was good.  What?  What?  What, did he come?  Like, what happened?  I don't know.  Hey, what happened?  What seems to have happened?  What happened?  Well, there's still...  What happened?  Fucker in the asshole. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  There's 960 people in town.  Some guy said, Jimmy, run up and stick a finger in his ass.  Jimmy.  Doink.  All right.  There's, uh, separation here.  She's getting up.  Hmm.  She's, uh, are they done?  I don't know.  She's walking around the room.  Did he bust?  I don't know.  Wait, she's back down in Liberator.  She's now...  Back in a blowjob position, or...  I can't...  I don't know.  Yeah, it looks like it's a blowjob position again.  Steve said fluff time.  Legal Steve.  All right.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, Elo is checking this out from Washington. 
[02:59:30]  Is he?  Oh.  He has joined the pal talk room.  Oh, great.  He's watching what Mel is going to do to us.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  All right.  Uh...  Yeah, there's some, uh, aural going on.  Yep.  Come on here.  You know what I'm going to start doing?  I'm just going to randomly start bouncing people from the pal talk room.  No.  No.  Here we go.  That's not nice. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yes.  Screaming, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Oh.  No.  I'm going to go fuck it up.  No.  Yes, I got it.  You got it.  Look, he's dogging her.  It's like...  This is good, dude.  This is good.  He's getting her dogging style.  I haven't had this in two years.  I got to fuck this up, though.  No.  Well, wait till later.  We never get it. 
[03:00:30]  Let's wait till we have the second couple come in.  I'll talk to you.  I'm going to fuck it up.  No, nine.  Everyone's saying no.  All right, there's a...  It's like pounding her from behind now.  I want to peek through there for Pete's sake.  We're going to do a money shot on her ass or something.  Yeah, he's from behind.  Give me your scarf, Steve.  I want to walk him.  No, no, no.  I got to.  I'm not going to fuck it up.  I want to peek.  I want to put on goggles and your fucking Amelia Earhart scarf.  Shut up.  We're done.  I'm done.  That's it?  All right, wait.  I got it. 
[03:01:00]  I got it.  Move.  Watch.  No.  No.  Break time.  No.  Break time.  They're done.  You got it.  The police are here.  The police are here.  What was that like?  That's how you stopped two third graders from taking gumballs.  Guys, cut it out.  Your moms are here.  Wow, very impressive, though. 
[03:01:30]  Was it?  Yeah, very good.  Bravo!  Yeah, that was good.  Very good.  That was good.  Absolutely.  Very good.  The jig is up.  The jig is up?  All right.  Where is he?  Jig, you're up.  Hey, there you go.  Getting rave reviews.  Woo-hoo.  That was great.  And lots of clapping.  A lot of thank you guys.  A baby will be born nine months from today.  Yeah, I'm okay.  Somewhere out there in radio land is going to be...  There's probably PalTalk people that had just signed up with their new account and just 
[03:02:00]  are on right now going, what the fuck did I miss?  All right.  Jennifer in Minnesota, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Hey, with H-Cups and her name is Jane, how much is that mask going to hide her identity?  Oh, good point, Jennifer.  You know what?  There's a lot of PalTalk people who are going to get spoiled, too, because they've had the  account for like three days.  They're like, wow, this is what it's like every day.  This is great.  Every day?  No. 
[03:02:30]  Usually you just watch us smelling Jimmy's farts.  Scott, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Scott.  I just wanted to comment.  Thank you for making my day about a thousand times better.  Yeah.  I was going to commit suicide because sitting in traffic in New Jersey, but I'm glad I'm  stuck in my car today and not in the office.  Yeah.  And I think that takes the gay away forever.  Yeah.  There's no gay in the city.  That was good.  We took the gay away.  Yep.  But thanks again, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a good day. 
[03:03:00]  How about this?  Why don't we get this on the show next?  Why don't we get a girl to fuck a guy with a strap on?  Why don't we do it?  I'm telling you, who's turning the radio off?  Okay.  Terrific.  I think we should do that.  I'm not good.  You can do it anyway.  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[03:03:30]  That would be a...  Let's get a dominatrix.  It's a fucker sub with a strap on.  I bet people out there would love that.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  I think we should do that.  And there's the lonely liberator all by itself now.  Okay.  I'll do it.  No.  We get a girl to fuck a guy with a strap on and we make him wear Steve's scarf. 
[03:04:00]  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Hey.  Thumbs up, guys.  Oh, that was great.  Yeah.  That was kind of cool.  That was kind of cool.  Good job.  Good job.  You only had 900 people check it out.  923, I think, at its peak.  Yeah, at its peak.  And, you know, all of North America, pretty much.  I mean, we're kind of out.  Everyone knows.  Everyone in our lives know what we do and who we are. 
[03:04:30]  No one could make out who you were, believe me.  Nah.  It wasn't one of those.  No, I'm serious.  Yeah, I think the big boobies, that's going to throw everyone off.  Yeah.  You did very good, though.  I can't believe you got a rod, dude.  I'm very impressed.  I would have been fucking...  That was like a semi kind of end of the night after a few drinks kind of...  Like a soggy six.  Yeah.  That's right.  A soggy six.  Florentine.  I can't take credit for that one.  A soggy six.  Jane, was it good for you? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, it was, actually.  What?  I didn't know how comfortable I was going to be.  It was good.  But it was good.  Yeah, you seemed pretty comfortable.  You seemed you were enjoying yourself.  Yeah.  That's nice.  It was fun.  Yeah.  The mask did it.  Yeah.  I had a little mystique.  His mask?  His mask?  Staring into that Grim Reaper mask he was wearing?  That was really funny.  Jesus.  I don't know what that was.  Yeah, you usually don't laugh when you watch porn, but that was kind of funny.  You worry about when you're out there in the lifestyle, you worry about the AIDS, or you 
[03:05:30]  wear bags, or what?  Everybody's very, very, everybody wears protection.  Really?  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  How the fun is that?  Everyone's careful.  I mean, you know, it's the whole...  Would you fuck Janet Jameson if she made you wear a condom?  No.  Really?  I mean, yeah, I would try.  No, yeah.  Jimmy laughs at all that stuff.  I know.  It's kind of like that.  Well, I don't think she'd make me wear a condom, because I'd go, really, I don't have AIDS,  I promise.  Oh, that would work.  I told my girlfriend, if we ever had a threesome, I don't want him to wear a bag, and I want you 
[03:06:00]  to go off the pill and be a breeder.  You kind of just put the condom on, and then as you're going, you kind of take your thumb,  and on the backstroke, rip the condom right off.  Only when you're cumming, though.  Then you jam it in there, make your fucking filler full of cum, and then you put the condom  back on, and you go, I don't know what happened.  It's a mystery.  It's a mystery.  How did this happen?  It's a miracle.  Hey, did Dad enjoy that?  Where's Dad? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, let's mic Dad.  I know.  Dad.  She's your daughter, not the one that was, you know, of course not.  This is my daughter here, yes.  Not the one that was in the room.  Oh, that's your daughter, and that's your daughter's boyfriend?  Correct, yeah.  That was your son, okay.  Are you kind of embarrassed right about now?  As a matter of fact, I am a little bit.  Yeah, that's got to be a little embarrassing.  The saving thing is, Sarah's a little bit older, so.  But guess what's even more embarrassing, sir?  Oh, no.  Guess who the next couple is in the room?  Oh, no. 
[03:07:00]  Now, see, that's when the dad actually goes out and makes a call to the police.  Right.  Yeah.  So they could watch, too.  We understand.  Man, we love the NYPD.  If they've got pals, thought they could, sure.  How old is the daughter?  Pardon?  How old is the daughter?  Sarah, a little embarrassed?  A lot, yeah.  Yeah, a lot.  The over-18, though?  What?  The over-18?  Uh, 23.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were you embarrassing your dad's there?  What were you thinking when this whole thing was going on?  Like, oh, God, just make this end?  Pretty much, yeah.  Were you close to running out? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  That's pretty embarrassing.  One day, we choose to come in and...  You haven't looked behind you the whole time, you know what?  You don't even want to know what your dad is looking like right now.  But with the boyfriend, though, how does the boyfriend feel?  Because you're with your girlfriend's father.  You've got to make a good impression.  Oh, yeah, that's...  I'd say it's awkward.  He probably kept saying to the dad, I have no idea what they're doing, sir.  What are they doing?  They should be playing Monopoly.  I got up a couple of times and walked to the window, so... 
[03:08:00]  Oh, did you?  Did you check it out?  Actually, the distance here, you can't really see, so...  Ah, good.  You're in a good position to not hear anything.  Good position, not a lot of sound, so it was okay.  Sarah, turn around and look at your dad for the first time.  I'm right.  No, there's nothing going on.  She refuses to turn around.  Just look.  He's all smiling.  Got a pup tent.  How you doing, Dad?  Hanging in there.  Hang on.  You see the little Sheena's sweat on her forehead from having been in there?  I mean, I'm trying to speak respectfully, but the fact that he just took her in there,  you know, did it proper. 
[03:08:30]  No, no, no.  I'm just trying to say this with a quick...  What an embarrassing situation for a...  Like, I would say the embarrassment factor has to be daughter most embarrassed, then father,  and then boyfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would agree with that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did the boyfriend, you didn't accidentally elbow the dad, did you?  Like, forgetting who you were with?  Hey, hey, right?  Huh?  Yeah, no.  Hey, boyfriend, how bad did you want to jump up and go, you're doing it all wrong?  Yeah.  Who am I to judge, you know?  How long have you guys been dating? 
[03:09:00]  Almost two years.  Oh.  Definitely, yeah, it's a long time.  And, yeah.  All right, a lot of...  Is there wedding bells in the future?  No.  No.  A lot of shaking heads.  Oh, wow, a lot of shaking heads.  Not anytime soon.  None of that.  Even the father shook his head.  Wow.  Why the...  Why the...  Why still, I guess, just don't like marriage, or what?  Way too young.  Way too young.  Don't want to.  I don't even want to think about it yet.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, don't.  My dad was doing the same thing, like, no, no, no. 
[03:09:30]  And you don't want to be swingers, obviously.  No, no.  Say we taught people a different life.  Not in front of my dad, at least.  Oh.  What?  Wow.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  Turn around and tell him, because he's ready to kill you.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  I was only kidding.  All right.  Let's say hi to David in Florida.  David.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I got a new bit for you.  I smell it.  Masquerade. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Does anybody remember last night?  God.  I think my suggestion deserves a little more credibility.  The scrap-on?  It would be...  We were hoping to forget that, Jimmy.  No.  No one is turning that off.  I'm telling you, some guy pinned back with a dumb deep, deep dick in him with a fake dick.  No one's turning that off.  Oh, my God.  I understand.  It would be hysterical whether I could actually watch it. 
[03:10:30]  I watch it on the monitor, you know?  That way it's like it's a movie.  Yeah.  It feels like...  It's not really happening.  That whole thing felt very far away.  Yeah, like, I don't know.  I'm watching it on a monitor.  A little camera that's not really happening.  Kind of like a security camera.  Yeah.  All right.  Dogshit Sniffer.  He's good for one every day.  Oh, Dogshit Sniffer.  From what side?  It would be great if the daughter just said, rookies. 
[03:11:00]  You guys can go home any time you want.  I mean, you really don't have to stay here.  They're all embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  It was fun.  It was just...  It happens in life.  I mean, sometimes you go out with your dad and you have to hear people have sex right  behind you.  It's normal.  Does that ever happen?  Um, not...  No, no.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mark the Trucker.  Mark, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How you doing today?  What's going on, man?  Well, I was going to tell you a bad swinging story.  Okay. 
[03:11:30]  Um, my wife and I went down to Poughkeepsie, Florida and met up with...  Excuse me.  Met up with another couple.  And, uh, we were in the room and she was over there getting, just doing some heavy petting  with the guy and I was over on the other side of the room with, uh, with the guy's wife.  And she finally, my wife, stood up and she looked at me and she said, I can't let you do this.  She's a fat pig. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  And the best part about the whole story is that her husband stood up with a hard-on, freaked out.  He looks me in the eye and he says,  Would it be better if I gave you tickets to Zany's Comedy Club July 27th and 29th for Nashville, Tennessee?  See, little Jimmy Norton?  Hmm.  Then what happened?  Sir, he plugged a gig I'm not doing.  Oh.  What happened? 
[03:12:30]  Oh, no.  It's on your website, Jimmy.  You stink.  Oh, wow.  Sir, July, we're in...  That's an old one.  I haven't updated.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  That was a damn good one, too.  That was a real good one.  God damn, why couldn't you have plugged Pittsburgh this weekend?  Thank you, anyway.  What are you, a fucking moron?  Yes, you are.  It would have been perfect if he said the improv in Pittsburgh, so...  No.  All right, we'll move on to some other things for now.  That was good, man. 
[03:13:00]  The couple's, uh...  They're taking phone calls.  Taking phone calls.  Everything all right?  Some swingers.  Thumbs up?  Getting the A-OK sign?  All right.  Hey, we got some fine XM material.  Can't do this on the other side.  No.  Insane Australian pedophile confronted by a reporter.  Have you seen this yet?  No.  No.  Oh, this guy loses his fucking mind.  I heard about it.  I'm in mind.  Is it video or audio?  Uh, this is...  I don't know if the video is...  The video's got to be out there, right?  Yeah, it's on Foundry.  It's on Foundry.  Okay, it's on openanthin.com.  And Steve's all paranoid now. 
[03:13:30]  About what?  About putting anything that isn't real up there.  Because everyone's consensus is it's completely real.  And Steve's like, I'm not sure.  Now he's all flustered.  Because Steve believes everything he sees on the internet.  Absolutely.  It's real, I swear.  All right.  Well, we got a pedo screaming at a reporter.  What's up?  No, I want to stand here.  I just wanted the mic on so I could stand here.  Ah.  You want me to...  Well, we'll play it for the radio audience and you'll play that for Jimmy over there.  Okay.  It's important to understand what Geoffrey Leonard is capable of. 
[03:14:00]  He lured two brothers, 16 and 13, into his home and his hands.  He showered them with gifts and money and even sent them love letters which are too sick to read out to you.  The same goes for their police statements.  They were systematically sexually abused beyond belief.  I have not, not, not, not, not.  Mate, I'm not a 13-year-old boy, okay?  You are a shit out. 
[03:14:30]  You're not going to intimidate me, Geoffrey.  You are a shit out.  Would you like to say sorry?  No.  You're not sorry for what you did?  I'm not sorry for what I did.  Oh, wow.  I'm not, not.  16 and 13, though, is like...  You could punch the guy in the face.  That's young, but it's not like...  I mean, that's creepy, but it's not like fucking eight-year-olds.  Which is creepy.  The guy looks like Colonel Sanders.  He's an older gentleman. 
[03:15:00]  He's lonely.  Ah, he just needed a little company.  Yeah, he just needed some fucking bald dick in his face.  Who doesn't?  It gets better.  It gets better.  For the rest of their lives, Geoffrey,  they'll be thinking about that animal who stole their innocence.  What about the last time you had sex with anybody?  That was an evil occasion, wasn't it?  There was no, no consent there, was there?  What are you saying, Geoffrey?  We are saying that you two are a raver.  You're enjoying this, aren't you?  Do you think those young boys enjoyed it when you abused them as young boys? 
[03:15:30]  Yes, they did.  Ah, hey.  Whose word can you take?  I don't know.  I don't know.  This guy sounds like a big cock blocker.  I want to hear what the older gentleman says.  He sounds like a reasonable man.  Well, talk to this humongous.  But it's not just the school children who walk past his home that are in reach of Geoffrey Leonard.  He's written more than a dozen books.  These books you've written, are they about molesting young boys? 
[03:16:00]  They're about molesting young boys, Geoffrey?  They're about molesting young boys.  They're about molesting young boys.  He's about to do it.  God, what a creep.  That guy is pretty creepy.  What a creep.  This next clip is beyond disturbing.  Should we play it?  of course the books and their author have a common cause ever since he left 
[03:16:30]  prison Jeffrey Leonard has dedicated his life  to overturning child sex laws which protect the innocent  is five years old too young  I don't believe there should be any age  would most Australians want their children living next door to a pedophile  who is not sorry for his actions who thinks it's acceptable to have sex with  a five-year-old a ten-year-old that's what you're saying isn't it  yes yes he's 72 this guy really yeah 
[03:17:00]  you gotta love the old cadre he's got some spunk he sure does  and it's all over a 13 year old's hair what a creep  they're like uh nose to nose pretty much the reporter is like very  stoic very stoic and the guy's just yelling and spitting in his face basically  you creepy old limey  you're fucking creep five years old jesus  yes 
[03:17:30]  hey uh jimmy's idea we got audio  remember uh what's his name came in  help me out  oh yeah yeah  we haven't played that in a while  what  yeah gavin  yes  where's eroc do we have that  gavin came in  oh yeah  one of gavin's buddies  this happened over uh in england  how long is how long is the audio eroc  all right he's trying to find it  gavin had uh with his phone  he swings i guess  yeah he's a big uh pervert

[03:18:30]  you get a dominatrix  and you get a guy  a sub  and you offer to pay for the session  or whatever it is you do  and uh  it's amazing what some of these guys do  you you can't  the nipple clan  believe me it's worth it  well supposedly east side dave  will do it for $800  on ron and fez  will do what  somebody just gave me info ron  oh i don't care  strap on dildo  so uh  large from lexington  i'm sure you already know  but east side dave from ron and fez  said he would take a dildo  up the poop chute

[03:19:30]  irak we got it  how long is it  three minutes  oh it's worth it  alright uh  so we did the set up right  yeah  so gavin has his uh  video phone  and he's just  he's just shooting video  laughing his ass off  while his friend's  getting it up the poop chute  from a dominatrix  and uh  a strap on  listen to this  okay so we've got

[03:26:30]  no  of course not  it's just looking  it's harmless  there's nothing dirty  about looking  yeah H Cup  go ahead  just look  take a look  who  who has been looking  at your boobs out there  let's be honest  you're gonna tell me  that everybody  and you guys too  you don't look at someone  who's nice looking  when you're walking  down the street  you do  you're maybe feeling  a little twinge of  wow look at that person  come on  nice looking  or nice boobs  either or  let me see  either or  take a look  go ahead  there  yeah 
[03:27:00]  look how uncomfortable  he was  he's like  yeah  yeah  they're there  I didn't really look  I didn't really look  girlfriend  and father  did Steve  did Steve look  at all H  I think  I think  just a quick glance  Steve C  yeah  he probably  tied his scarf  around his eyes  he doesn't want  to look  don't make me  it's a kryptonite  to me  yeah  did Travis look  he's the one 
[03:27:30]  that looked like  Travis did  alright  he should hold one  like a big cat  it's just the look  yeah  that is the most  uncomfortable  little family  of the greatest  people out there  they're still here  they're hanging in there  it's a pedophile story  and everything  that guy was a creep  right  oh yeah  major  yeah  that's  I was going to say no  yeah  who's the three  five is the age  of consent  in certain places  five  five is not acceptable 
[03:28:00]  in any culture  right  five  let's say hi  to Ray in Jersey  Ray what's up  yo yo  hey  when I was in college  I was like 20  I was at the bar  and I met this older  chick from England  she was like 28  so we go back  to her hotel room  have us a little romp  she's laying on her back  I'm like kneeled over her  right  and she's giving me oral  and like three times  she stuck her hand up  behind me  and tried to stick 
[03:28:30]  her finger in my ass  and I kept having to  brush her hand away  it was like when you  were like 13  and you're like  kissing a girl  and you kind of like  you try to feel her breast  but she moves her hand  but like still keeps kissing you  you know  like doesn't want to mess up  what's going  like I didn't disrupt the world  but I kept like  brushing her hand away  man she wouldn't give it up  maybe it's the Brits  I don't know  but you know  I wasn't having it  how the fuck did you  why did you brush your hand away  what's wrong with you  well cause I  I did  something in my ass  isn't a pleasurable experience  no no  but a finger tickling 
[03:29:00]  I don't want to hit my ass either  but a finger probing  and I'm trying to say this respectfully  because of the family situation  out there  but just when you're having  your cock sucked  like a family  like no no  just a finger opening  the cheeks  I think he's tapping out  I think that was it  no no I'm okay  a finger opening the ass cheeks  separating the ass cheeks  and gently slipping  the tip of a finger in  did she wet her finger  before she was going to  penetrate your asshole with it  no no  she didn't wet her finger  before she tried to stick  her finger on my cornhole 
[03:29:30]  but isn't that kind of  slippery slope  Jimmy like isn't it a finger  no  then the dildo  then like a baseball bat  no sir  it's not a slippery slope  you stop where you're comfortable  like  I'm  I'm trying to say this  so I'll do respect you  yeah be careful Jimmy  the father and the daughter  out there  don't be uncomfortable  this is not  but like  I'm saying  if you're having your cock  like say you're on your knees  and you're sucking that dick  and she slips her finger  between your legs  to spread your ass cheeks  which might be a little  sweaty or whatever  how do you stop her 
[03:30:00]  from just  sliding a finger  gently  the father's walking away Jimmy  you might want  I'm not trying to be rude  yeah he's not trying to be rude  keep it clean Jimmy  we got a family out there  no no no  I'm not even going to ask the dad  like  if his own personal  because I mean  everyone  I don't know what my dad likes  right  but if my dad was here  I'd say dad  did mom ever like  try to slip you a Mickey  did mom ever try to slip  a Mickey  Jimmy you got to think  your dad is into some crazy things 
[03:30:30]  he might be man  I don't know  a little bit  a little bit  maybe a little bit  yeah  maybe you're a chip off the old block  let's hope not  when it comes to that  I hope not  so just to say  with all due respect  because we are in the presence of family  yeah  little Jimmy  you recommend that the next time  yes dad  it's snowing outside  yes  we all know that  come back from the window  a wonderful lady  wants to stick her wet finger in my asshole  that I should let her do it  oh absolutely do  because I like my  like if  when my girl's slobbery on my cock  and  when she's like touching my balls 
[03:31:00]  I like her finger to  like go below my balls  and  if she tickles the ass  I go  and I lift a little  and that's the signal  go on  don't be shy  this way you don't feel gay  here's the thing  you don't want to ask for it  because that's too revealing  but if you're like moaning  and a finger slips in your ass  if it just happens to mosey on in there  you don't want to be rude  mosey  I've never seen that color red before in my life  there's a lot of red faces out there  no there's no need to be red  it's fucking okay  there's nothing wrong  this break could be on regular radio 
[03:31:30]  it's really no big deal  absolutely  Jimmy's kept it very clean today  a lot of people in their early 20s  like having oral sex like that  I don't think anybody should be ashamed of it  yeah  there's nothing wrong with  putting a finger on your boyfriend's ass  it's totally acceptable  Jimmy  you've persuaded me almost  punch it out  all right  thank you sir  let's go to  Manny from Jersey  Manny  yo  Jimmy is totally the gay instigator man  every time you guys get away from it  he just pulls you right back in  that's not true sir 
[03:32:00]  you do bring us right back in  you do Jimmy  no but I just thought it'd be funny  to have a strapping  a strap attack in this place  clean us out  you got like gay gravity around you man  no  we're all like  just a good strap attack  we're getting sucked in  we're getting sucked into the gay zone  whenever you're around  I think a good strap attack  is what we need to cleanse the palate  a strap attack huh  all right  maybe we should ask dad  what we should be talking about today  that's true  yeah  or Sarah  Sarah is a big fan of the show  she's at all our events 
[03:32:30]  you know  yeah this is  like we said  very out of the ordinary  yeah  show today  Sarah  what were you hoping to hear today  um  dead air  I mean you came here  talk about idol  this is the first time  American Idol  or uh  have Anthony do Tony Danza  or Andrew Dice gay  oh wow  and instead you get uh  you know those up the ass  fingers  fingers  fingers  fingers  sneaking in  when no one's looking  and live sex acts 
[03:33:00]  that are completely illegal  even for this type of radio  yeah  nice  yeah  yeah  let's uh  let's say hi to Pete in Philly  Pete what's up  gentlemen  good morning  welcome aboard  glad to be aboard Jimmy  a few years back  I'm in LA  visiting a long distance girlfriend  after a few months  not seeing her  in the shower  she's on her knees  I'm getting blown  she's diddling around  back there  just a  diddling  diddling  diddling  around in the back 
[03:33:30]  long story short  by the end of it  I was  just  dying to have  just  pop a finger  right in there  yeah  quit the diddling  and stick it in  well sometimes  if a girl's tickling  my asshole  and she's not putting it  I'll lean back  and go hey  how about we cut down  on the dilly dallying  how about  we cut down  on the dilly dallying  no dilly dallying  what you do is this  if a girl  I'm sorry about it  if a girl's kneeling 
[03:34:00]  and blowing you  and she's got her finger  tickling your ass  what you do is  you use gravity  to your advantage  you separate your cheeks  a little bit  and then you plunge down  you plunge down  you just  cause she's on her knees  and her finger is like  positioned straight up  behind your butthole  so you act like  you're yawning  you're balls deep  in her mouth  and you open your cheeks  and you're  and you're plunged down  never thought  I would have liked that  but by the end  of that session  I wanted it in there  and the best part was  after it was all 
[03:34:30]  said and done  we got out of the shower  she made me feel  how wet the whole  ordeal had made her  and boy  oh boy did it  I don't blame her  wow  she was a good egg  did she make you  smell her finger  even after she  washed it 80 times  oof  alright let's get it  as long as she was  twirling a mushroom on it  Dave in Jersey  David  hey how's it going guys  the father's back up  by the way  we got him sitting again  and now he's up again  alright let's go David  how's everything guys  pretty good  hey  alright I was out of

[03:38:00]  is funny  thank you sir  but getting your ass licked  and figured would differ  we weren't even talking  about the ass licked  Jimmy  keep it clean  we got you know  yeah there's a family  out there  yeah  well my girlfriend  I dominate my girlfriend  with my cock  be very careful how you say this  okay  my girlfriend like  will lay back  and I'll kind of like  I'll hit her face  and get some pre-cum on it  and then I'll rub my balls  on her mouth  because she likes  she likes the feeling  of like the warm cock  on her face  just to be as submissive  like that  but she doesn't lick my ass  I haven't like  one girl I used to date 
[03:38:30]  would lick my ass  like I'd kind of like  as after the pre-cum  was on her face  I would actually move  my balls over her mouth  and then my ass  would be on her mouth  and I would say  go ahead lick  and she would just  open her mouth  and she would lick  and she would just  she would lick it  and it was really nice  she'd go tongue deep  into my ass  no I like that though  but a lot of times  she would hold her tongue  straight and I would  just kind of like  just fuck it slightly  it was really nice  to get my asshole swabbed  you ever get your asshole  swabbed  they're having a very  uncomfortable conversation  out there  they're trying to figure out  where to eat lunch  yeah  it's a good opportunity
