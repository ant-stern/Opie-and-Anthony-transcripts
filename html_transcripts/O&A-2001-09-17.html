<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks, was a chaotic blend of raw reactions, dark humor, listener calls, and political commentary.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, began by expressing their anger at the attacks, specifically targeting those who stole neighbors' flags and expressing their disdain for what they perceived as insufficient support from the French and Italian governments.  They discussed the difficulty of finding distractions, noting increased television viewing and a need for alternative forms of escape.  A caller, "Psycho Mark," expressed extreme anger and violent fantasies, even suggesting becoming a suicide bomber. Another caller reported seeing French tourists taking pictures near Ground Zero, further fueling the hosts' anti-French sentiment.  The hosts debated conflicting news reports about Italy's response and expressed skepticism about its initial hesitancy.  They also criticized inappropriate music selections on some radio stations.  A significant portion focused on securing beer and supplies for emergency responders near Ground Zero, culminating in a successful call to Jim Cook of Sam Adams brewery to arrange beer deliveries.  The segment concluded with a trivia question referencing a stock from *I Love Lucy*.

The show continued with extensive commentary on the post-9/11 landscape.  Opie and Anthony heavily criticized Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, employing highly offensive and sexually degrading language in their descriptions.  They also discussed Mayor Rudy Giuliani's high-profile public appearances, speculating on his relentless schedule. Stockbroker Dave called in to provide a first-hand account of the dramatic downturn and emotional atmosphere at the New York Stock Exchange, and the hosts speculated on the market's future. The controversial list of songs deemed inappropriate for radio play after the attacks was discussed at length, with Opie and Anthony mocking many of the choices.  They also criticized the pronouncements of religious figures like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who attributed the attacks to perceived American moral failings.  Calls from various listeners, including comedian Mario Cantone, who discussed a recent television interview, and a caller recounting a news reporterâ€™s removal from Ground Zero, filled the segment. The hosts mentioned Ray Stevens' song "Ahab the Arab."

A flight attendant, Debbie, called in to describe her recent flight, noting the low passenger load and security measures.  This led to another discussion of the song ban list, with the hosts listing numerous artists deemed inappropriate, including Jackson Browne, Cat Stevens, Jan and Dean, Martha and the Vandellas, Van Halen, the Hollies, Don McLean, John Lennon, Bobby Darin, and the Clash.  They also debated the lyrics of "Afternoon Delight" and the theme song from *Alice*. The discussion broadened to encompass news coverage of the attacks, Dick Cheney's account of his White House evacuation, Michael Jackson's planned benefit song, and John Cougar Mellencamp's concert, with a caller recounting seeing a fireman in the audience.  The segment ended with further listener calls and continued discussion of the novelty song "Ahab the A-Rab."

The final segment featured more political commentary mixed with crude humor and listener calls. Opie and Anthony continued their scathing critique of Hillary Clinton, using offensive and sexually degrading language to describe her appearance.  They discussed the struggles of New York City businesses, particularly a friend's restaurant in Little Italy, and mentioned Jim Cook's beer donation to firefighters and police. Numerous listener calls followed, some offering humorous non sequiturs and others expressing more serious political commentary, including criticisms of Jerry Falwell and Dick Cheney. One caller, a military member, expressed gratitude for the show's distraction. The hosts' banter throughout remained highly informal and filled with offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show a couple phone numbers for everybody. Yeah, that was live. A song called overcome recorded at W.Y.S.P. in Philadelphia.  How about that? A couple phone numbers if you're in the New York area. 877-692-1027. Anywhere else, please give us a call. 866-277-4WOW. That's 866-277-4WOW. What are we going to do today? That's what everybody wants to know. 
[00:00:30]  Well, we'll just kind of go along with our little program. We'll go with the flow, right, Anthony?  Yeah, you know, I could start by giving a big F you out to the person that stole my neighbor's flag. 
[00:01:00]  I kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a flag if you stole it from your neighbor.  I'm loving that we're all bonding and wherever you go, you see the American flags and yeah.  I mean, but if you have to steal someone else's flag so you could have one, it kind of goes against it.  Maybe you should just go about your business without a flag.  They don't need your help.  Right. How amazing is that?  It's really hard to find an American flag, so they're like, hey, I need one. I'm stealing my neighbors. 
[00:01:30]  Everyone's feeling very patriotic. I just hope it doesn't then fade away with time. You know what I mean?  Because already, I got to tell you, already you're hearing a little more about how we should maybe not attack some of these nations.  You're hearing that already?  Yeah, I'm kind of hearing it more on the news and the basic vibe is that, you know, it's been almost a week and, you know, people, humans are incredibly resilient beings. 
[00:02:00]  You know what I mean?  Like last Tuesday, you're watching TV, you're going, oh my God, this is it. We're never going to get over this.  And then, you know, I'm driving in today and the roads have more cars and trucks on them than they did Friday and Thursday.  And people are getting a little more pissed off at the people's driving habits.  We're slowly getting back into the swing of things.  And before you know it, you won't see as many American flags and you'll start hearing people bitching and complaining that we're sending troops and equipment to other countries. 
[00:02:30]  I think the liberals need to just get out of our way on this one.  Yeah, could they just please just shut the F up for a little while?  You watch the news programs and they pop these people on.  And then Friday, there was supposed to be this candlelight vigil at Washington Square Park here in New York City.  And it sounded great.  You know, support the country and the emergency workers and remember the victims. 
[00:03:00]  This whole thing wrapped up into one.  A lot of people went down there and the news was covering it.  And I'm watching.  It turns out to be this goddamn peace rally pretty much with people holding up anti-police signs saying that we shouldn't go to war and just criticizing U.S. policy on this whole thing.  Like, what the, they're using an opportunity that was supposed to be for support as just a liberal peace rally. 
[00:03:30]  Now, peace, great thing.  But sometimes you got to kick a little ass to keep it.  And then we'll get back to the peace thing.  And then we get back to the peace thing.  We had a long string of peace, didn't we?  It was nice.  Nice string of peace.  Now you got to kick a little ass to make some more peace.  That's how the world works.  It's not going to change.  That's how it's been for thousands of years.  That's how it's been since the caveman had a go.  He comes in.  He's sitting in his cave, right?  He's got his cavewoman. 
[00:04:00]  They're eating some pterodactyl meat or whatever the hell it is.  All of a sudden, they're at peace.  They're having a great time, you know?  And then caveman B comes in from the cave down the mountain.  Now he wants the guy's chick or the meat or something like that.  You got to pick up the club.  You got to bash him over the head.  You kick him out of your cave.  That's kicking some ass, right?  Sure.  And then what does he go back to?  His chick and his meat.  Right.  Right.  There is a time you got to kick some ass.  You don't want no caveman coming into your cave? 
[00:04:30]  Taking your chick and your meat?  You got to kick and hit him with a club.  And then everything falls.  Then you go.  And you know something?  If you don't kill him, he'll go out and tell people, don't go into that cave.  Don't get his chick or his meat because he'll hit you over the head with a club.  And I'm assuming that caveman, while he was sitting there eating his meat and hanging out with his chick,  and another caveman's trying to steal his stuff.  Yeah.  I'm assuming the caveman wasn't sitting there listening to Give Peace a Chance on the radio, right?  No.  He's kicking some ass.  That's right.  He picks up the club and hits him.  I heard all a bunch of pukey NYU students just trying to mean something and have some value in their dumb, spoiled, paid-for lives. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Stupid schmucks.  I hate that.  I hate that when people, when it's held up right in front of their face, they can't see that there is a time to kick some ass.  And then we get back to the business of being at peace, having our chicks, and eating our meat.  Who's the one little?  I'm not letting go of that analogy.  I'm sorry. 
[00:05:30]  It's a good analogy.  It's so simplistic.  I like the analogy.  It ties everything up.  God damn it.  And speaking of which, we're all really sad, and we all need distractions.  I mean, I'm at home all weekend just trying to find anything else to watch on the TV.  Not for the day.  For a half hour, just to take a break.  Because trust me, I still put in about 20 hours of TV viewing on this whole thing over the weekend.  And ladies, can you help us out? 
[00:06:00]  I know we're all depressed, but we kind of, you know, you know.  You know.  You need a little of the sex.  We need to get some.  I understand that.  It's a very weird situation.  But once you get into it, you know, you're into it.  And I'm certainly not asking my girl for it.  You know, she's emotional as it is.  So I'm like, okay, all right, well, you know.  Really?  That would be the worst.  You're going at it, and she just starts weeping.  And I'm like, oh, God, all right, I'll roll off.  I'm just thinking of distractions. 
[00:06:30]  We need distractions, you know.  A lot of people thought that it was a good thing that we didn't have football this weekend.  I was dying to see a game this weekend.  You wanted a game.  Not so I could sit there and get drunk and eat chili and really get into the game.  Just so I had something to get my mind off everything for just a couple hours.  And then I'll go back to the footage.  I'll go back to everything.  I'll go back to listening to all the sappy songs on the radio.  So first of all, I'm completely, I've had it with any of the footage.  I don't even watch it anymore if it comes on the news. 
[00:07:00]  I still watch the news because I like to see what the government has planned for these countries.  But I cannot watch any more footage of the buildings.  Well, I can't get enough because, you know, you have to watch the same coverage over and over again.  But then a station will break with something brand new.  Yeah.  Did you see the footage of the guy who saw the whole cloud coming his way and he was in a, he got into a store?  Oh, it was a woman.  And it was all glass.  And you see the thing come by the window like it's a blob?  It's like a monster movie.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:30]  Like a monster movie.  The tower collapsed.  There was no video.  This woman's out on the street with a handheld camcorder.  She videotapes the building collapse, which looked like she was a few blocks away.  You get this element of safety and distance.  So she's standing there.  People are running into this store, storefront.  It's got the big glass window in front of the glass door.  They're pulling people in.  So someone starts yelling at her, get in here, get in here.  It's all on the videotape.  She runs in and then they're saying, get away from the windows. 
[00:08:00]  Here comes the debris.  They all pull back to the back of the store, but she keeps the camera going and keeps it on the window.  And you hear everyone go, here it comes.  Now, what looks to be a white cloud, you would imagine if you're engulfed in this, it would be like when you fly through a cloud in a plane or something.  It's just very bright, very white.  The white you see is the sun reflecting off of it.  Inside this thing, pitch black.  So when the cloud rolled across the storefront, all of a sudden, pitch black and you're just seeing debris and papers and everything else fly past the window. 
[00:08:30]  And the woman just starts yelling, oh, my God, you saved my life.  You saved my life.  It was pretty intense video.  It really was.  I'm not sure what channel played it.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, like that stuff.  All right, I'll watch that once, maybe twice.  I can't watch the buildings anymore.  The aerial view that CNN had of zero.  Yeah, that's depressing.  Wow.  That's depressing.  Man.  But, you know, I've just had it.  I really, I rented movies.  I played video games. 
[00:09:00]  That was my whole escape weekend.  My whole escape.  Because you can only take so much.  I've had it.  I really want the next phase of this to start, which is the ass-kicking part.  And it looks to me like it's going to be something like 72 hours.  How many days is that?  Three.  Help me out.  Three days.  Something like that.  Three more days we've got to wait?  I think so.  For the initial attack? 
[00:09:30]  Here's what I hear.  Pakistan sent a little envoy to the Taliban government in Afghanistan and said, look, you  have 72 hours to turn over bin Laden or else there's going to be something laid out on your  ass that you are not even going to believe.  And at first they said, no, no, no, no.  Now, the latest news is that the Taliban is going to leave it in the hands of Muslim clerics 
[00:10:00]  which is like a holy guy, whether they should turn over bin Laden.  I still see huge military action coming whether they turn him over or not because he's not  the only guy.  There's still countries, entire countries responsible for supporting this guy.  So it seems to me if Pakistan gave Afghanistan an ultimatum with a time limit that we would  have to acknowledge that time limit.  We can't then tomorrow go in and bomb and go, oh, you gave us 72 hours.  You know what I mean? 
[00:10:30]  So that's what I think.  But hey, I'm a schmuck.  I could be wrong.  And the damn French, what are they doing to us again?  These cowardly bastards that are the French.  Again, they go, well, we have reservations about the aiding the Americans.  Who was pulverized on the beaches of Normandy, your disgusting little beaches, to liberate 
[00:11:00]  your country back in World War II from the Nazis?  Americans.  British.  All the people that you should be helping out now, the people that are behind this effort  to get rid of terrorism.  Those are the people you should be supporting.  But again, in their cowardly fashion, their cowardly tradition of the French, they're pulling out. 
[00:11:30]  They're not going to help us.  Remember the last time they didn't support us?  Remember what Reagan did to them?  Right.  Back when we were bombing Muammar Gaddafi into shut-up-edness, which we really did a good  job of.  He was the head muckety-muck terrorist back then.  Remember that?  It was always Muammar Gaddafi, Muammar Gaddafi.  We laid some bombs down on him.  Uncle Ronnie in the Air Force killed one of his children in a tent somewhere.  Last you heard of Gaddafi, it broke the man.  It broke him.  But we couldn't fly over France.  Exactly. 
[00:12:00]  Now, France said, no, we will not have your warplanes fly over our country in the pelt  of this bombing of Libya.  So we had to fly, the American planes had to add an extra, I believe it was something  like 16 hours of flying time to get back from this mission.  So listen to what Reagan does.  Go ahead, Ed.  Uncle Ronnie found out later that one of the planes had dropped a bomb on the French embassy. 
[00:12:30]  And Uncle Ronnie just says something to the effect of, well, the boys were tired.  What a kick-ass move that is.  They were tired from having to fly so far.  Now, if the French were to open the airspace, I'm sure they'd have been able to get a little  more sleep.  They would have been so jittery on that button.  Oops.  Okay, you're going to have to fly around France.  But when you get back over land, hey, guys, what do you say your hand gets a little jumpy 
[00:13:00]  on that bomb button?  And if it was over the French embassy, well, I don't see a problem.  You're sleepy.  That kicks ass.  But again, again, years later, these cowardly race of people, the French.  And I got to also say, I'm not taking sides here.  The frigging Italians also.  I don't know what the hell they do.  Lob their frigging meatballs at them with catapults. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know what kind of army the Italians even have.  Oh, we'll tie you up with pasta.  Hey, it's a good.  They're like the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  They tweak your nose or something.  I don't even know what the Italian army looks like.  But they also have said that they won't take part in this.  And they think it's wrong that President Bush is using the word war.  You come over here, you goddamn sauce-stirring bastard, and look at where the World Trade  Center was.  And you tell me the word war is inappropriate. 
[00:14:00]  So the French and the Italians can kiss my ass, pussy-ing out.  Another country in World War II.  Which side do we a fighter for?  I don't know.  Whoever wins, that's who we a jump on.  And Anthony is Italian.  I don't care.  No, I'm American.  F Italy.  Bunch of confused people over there, too.  And the pussy French.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to say, over the weekend, I was listening to the radio, and it just felt 
[00:14:30]  like when you were younger.  You know, you went out with that first girl you really liked, you know?  And then you break up, and every song seems to have a whole new meaning.  Yes.  That's what every tune this weekend, I was like, oh, man, this song really hits the point.  And then the next song, it could have been anything.  It was like, oh, man, what a great tune, you know?  Yeah, I understand.  This is my true feelings on this, because I was listening to all the radio stations.  I understand throwing a song here or a song there.  We opened the show with Live Overcome, a great song. 
[00:15:00]  There were radio stations just the whole weekend just killing you.  Yeah.  Just trying to make you feel sad and bad, you know?  We're not going to forget anytime soon, and hopefully never.  But, you know, I think we have to, like, regroup as a country and get ready to kick some serious  ass here.  And you're tuning in the radio, and you're just trying to forget the whole mess that  happened Tuesday, or at least put it out of your mind for an hour.  We had a great weekend here in New York, weather-wise.  And you turn on the radio, and it's, everybody hurts sometimes. 
[00:15:30]  I'm like, oh.  And then you're, sometimes everybody cries.  Right.  Oh, enough, enough.  And then you turn the dial, and they're doing the New York Minute remix crap.  It's like, I, I, oh, stop, stop.  Anthony, you there?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Listen, I just heard Colin Powell make an announcement.  They know what they're going to do about France backing out. 
[00:16:00]  What?  They send an Opie over with a couple of scuba tanks.  That's right.  Opie even knows how cowardly the French are.  He kicked a Frenchman's ass 60 feet underwater.  And I was proud of my friend.  Damn straight.  All right.  I bless America, boys.  Keep it up.  All right.  This just in, Ash from Boston's checking in.  He says, France opposes armed response, recommends surrender.  Hmm.  So the French are recommending we just throw our weapons down and weep.  They really are a nation of merry boys. 
[00:16:30]  I absolutely hate them.  You know, the stereotype there is, yes, they are just a nation of cowardly people who, by the grace of the courageous countries around the world, are still there.  That's the only reason there is a France.  It isn't because of their courage under fire when the Nazis rolled in unopposed that they're still there.  It was the Americans, the Russians, and the British bailing their sorry asses out. 
[00:17:00]  And it's disturbing that they have not paid back the favor by even letting us fly over their airspace, that they even still have airspace.  Ugh.  Disgusting French.  They're just swarthy, greasy Euro trash.  With their berets and holding their cigarette that funny way with their thumb and forefinger.  Stupid, unchained arms.  Painting things.  And they're dumb women.  Oh, and they're crepe Suzettes.  Yeah.  Whatever the hell that is. 
[00:17:30]  Yes, Opie.  I like the crepe.  I do, too.  They are very yummy.  Their food is fantastic.  The world is a jungle.  And if you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness.  You won't get it.  Yes, mother.  People let you down, and I'm not naming any names.  But in the end, you die in your own arms.  There you go.  What are you talking about, Ma?  Thank you, Mother Soprano.  Let's go to Psycho Mark. 
[00:18:00]  Psycho Mark.  Oh, goddamn French bastards.  Give me a gun, put me on a plane, and I will go over to Afghanistan myself and just take them out.  I'll be a suicide bomber.  You know what it is with the French, too?  They always get pissed off whenever something happens that we comment that they're a nation of cowards.  Yet every time they reinforce it by being a nation of cowards.  This is about our chicks and our meat.  If it wasn't for us, we'd be speaking German right now. 
[00:18:30]  You know that?  Absolutely.  We'd be speaking German.  Ons in Dorsk in the Aspen, the Asian.  They gave their country up without a fight.  Unbelievable.  I don't want to hear about the resistance, either.  Oh, we had the French resistance.  Yeah, you resisted conflict, you bunch of pansies.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah, bros.  I hear the firemen and the policemen and everyone down near Ground Zero could use free beer, huh?  Dude, there's one bar down here called Puffy's. 
[00:19:00]  They're open until 4 in the morning.  And they're running low on a lot of stuff like beer and supplies.  Yeah, because you can't get supplies in, right.  All right, I think we can do something about this.  Finally, I think we've got a cause we can do something about.  We have a beer connection in Boston.  Right.  So I think we should call up him.  They definitely need some ships of some beer and supplies.  Also, another thing that we need down here is some flags.  We need some big flags.  I'm willing to actually, if you guys can get me a huge flag, I'd hang it right off the top of my building. 
[00:19:30]  And I know there's an old World War II vet that lives in the building we're on right now.  He's desperately looking for a flag to hang from his apartment.  All right.  And let's stop stealing flags from each other.  There's people stealing flags.  How unbelievable is that?  Are you serious?  Swear to God.  So there's assistance.  And another thing, if you don't have to be down in this area, stay the F out.  There's people down here taking pictures.  I want to punch them in the teeth.  Unless you're in the neighborhood, unless you're helping out with the rescue efforts, 
[00:20:00]  or you're in the media, stay the F away.  Yeah.  That's going to fall on deaf ears.  People are just so curious.  People are just obnoxious.  And talking to French people, whoa, Jesus, you're going to love this, right?  These two stinky French goddamn tourists are taking pictures in front of the building.  His bitch is taking...  She's posing.  Posing.  Posing.  I'm in front of the workers.  Oh, my God.  Posing in front of the workers.  Posing.  Yet their cowardly country won't even aid us and help us.  I wanted a choker. 
[00:20:30]  I just wanted a choker and stick a talent on the throat.  And here's a picture for you, you dumb boy.  Psycho Marx, man.  This is the new and improved Psycho Marx.  I love it.  I like the Psycho Marx.  Dude, I am so mad.  Get me a plane.  I'll fly over myself to Afghanistan, and I will be a suicide bomber.  I don't care anymore.  You get me guns.  Get me missiles.  I'll be the army.  Screw them.  So goddamn bad.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  But if you guys get us beer down here, that'd be great.  Oh, and Stinky, give me a couple of victory joints, will you? 
[00:21:00]  They're called victory joints now.  You've got to send me two so I can make a V-Win.  I need 10 pounds of marijuana.  I'm going to be on top of the live shop with Fox for months.  All right, Mac.  Bye, guys.  Later, bro.  Friggin' lunatic he is.  And B, that's on line three from D.C.  All right, hold on.  I'll go there.  Yeah, go there because...  Every day.  Every day the phones are kablooey sometimes.  Every day those phones do not work.  How come I can't go to B?  We'll go to B in a second.  And Jay's pissed about my comments. 
[00:21:30]  I don't care.  All right, try that.  Hey, B.  Hey, what's up?  What are you saying?  No, I was saying about what you said about the Italians.  I heard on CNN down here as well as WTRP radio that the Italian defense minister has stated that Italy is firmly behind the United States both militarily and intelligence-wise.  Well, I'm reading off of the AP and it says Italian defense minister Antonio Martino said Italian troops would not take part in any U.S. retaliation. 
[00:22:00]  No kidding.  War is inappropriate, and I feel I am in a position to categorically exclude calling on the Italian army.  Damn.  So, I mean, right there is, you know, instead of saying what you're not going to do to help, even if these countries don't want to commit any forces to help us, instead of telling us what you're not going to do for us, tell us how you are going to support us with maybe diplomats in the U.N. getting behind the U.S. position. 
[00:22:30]  Tell us what you're doing to help us, not telling us that you're not supporting us with troops and stuff.  The Italians can kiss my ass, and the French can kiss my ass.  I could not agree more.  I wonder why there's such a discrepancy in that, because I heard it on the radio and the news.  That's weird.  But I agree with you 100%.  All right, B.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  And Jay, for some reason, is pissed off.  Jay, what's the problem, man?  Yo, man, I'll tell you one thing, dude.  Yeah.  France is its own country, and for you to talk trash about them isn't right. 
[00:23:00]  Why?  F-U and F-Anthony.  Why?  I'll tell you what.  France has its own problems.  What have they done to pay back the huge debt to the world for giving them back their country?  Hey, man, they're still rebuilding.  They still have problems.  Still rebuilding.  These people have not helped out any U.S. cause since the end of World War II.  They have not helped us one iota.  Tell me one thing the United States needs that French has. 
[00:23:30]  How about support during this crisis?  How about letting us fly over their effing, stinking airspace?  Hey, hey, I'll tell you what.  If they need help, they'll do it.  Bull.  They will not.  They've already said they won't.  What are you talking about?  They've already denied us their airspace back when we had to bomb Libya.  Do they want a plane going through the frickin' Eiffel Tower?  Why?  It's just a piece of disgusting steel anyway.  Put some sides on that thing.  Listen.  Jesus Christ.  Are you French?  No.  Then what's the problem?  Why do you care?  They're not going to like a kick your ass.  A nation of cowards. 
[00:24:00]  What did he say?  I don't know.  With their foreign legion.  We are the foreign legion.  With their towels on their heads.  With the little paper towel thing on the back of their head to dry your hands on after you wet on them.  And if Americans hate them, stop going to Paris and taking your dumb vacations to that stupid country  and just seeing it's decrepit and it's old and who cares about it.  How about some support from that country?  How about support from the country we bailed out? 
[00:24:30]  Nothing.  We've got nothing from them.  Tony, what's going on?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, guys?  Happy to see you guys are okay and your families are well.  Thanks, Tony.  I forget what's on the screen, what I was going to say.  What a dick.  Is he French?  I'm Italian.  Know what?  I take Anthony.  I'm American first.  That's it.  American.  Fuzzle, greaseball, boom-ba-doo, gatsas, don't have any balls, please.  The French.  They love Jerry Lewis.  Tony.  It's right there.  It's enough said.  Tony, it says on the screen, though, what's with WKTU?  They are playing disco remixes for the World Trade Center? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they're playing disco remixes.  Who the hell wants to hear, like, friggin' Run DMC behind it?  Huh, huh.  Oh, there's a terrible b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bombing going on.  Really?  Are they doing remixes?  Well, they're up in mind.  They throw on K-Rock.  Eh, normal crap.  I throw on 104.  At least they're playing, like, Born in the USA by Springsteen.  Which is an anti-American song.  Born in the USA.  I know.  People should stop playing that.  That slams the U.S.  I don't understand that.  We don't need anyone slamming the U.S. right now.  Dude, keep it up. 
[00:25:30]  Norton, you're the man.  Attack all of these French hairy armpits, skank, flea circus bitches.  They really are.  Guys rock, man.  Keep it going, brothers.  All right.  I wonder if everyone else is enjoying the, you know, the sad songs that these stations  are playing.  No.  James Taylor, you've got a friend.  Oh.  When you're down in trouble.  Enough.  And you need a help.  I'm like, I have enough sadness in my life right now.  I don't need, you know, these songs to help me out.  I had the ultimate part of sadness of this whole thing, which was last week on that first 
[00:26:00]  day that was really rainy and gloomy.  And the smoke was still coming up and I was...  Was that Friday?  Yeah.  The day of the morning?  Was that...  That's when it rained.  It was the...  That was the first day it rained on us.  It was the day they had the memorial in Washington in the church.  Oh.  That was Friday.  Yeah.  This was the...  Because now I can listen to anything and just be like, I'm just pissed off.  But it was the battle hymn of the Republic when they were having that song live right 
[00:26:30]  there and I was right under the Brooklyn promenade on the BQE and I had an entire view of the  skyline, what's left of it.  And it was raining, disgusting, smoke billowing up and you're hearing, glory, glory, hallelujah.  And I'm looking over and going, oh, I'm going to lose it.  I'm going to effing lose it.  I'm looking at the battlefield, listening to the battle hymn of the Republic.  It's a dark, gloomy, depressing day and I'm looking at a part of our world that was destroyed.  I'm looking at every car next to me because every news station was carrying it. 
[00:27:00]  People crying their eyes out.  That's good.  So now I'm just...  That's good.  You know, that was my moment.  But that's good.  So now it's just...  That all makes sense.  Oh, yeah.  But to throw like everybody hurts out there.  Yeah, now I'm just...  Get out of here.  Everybody hurts.  Enough.  Sometimes.  For some reason the saddest thing, not the saddest thing, but the thing that  that really choked me up and I don't know why it did was watching our national anthem  played in Buckingham Palace. 
[00:27:30]  I don't know why.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That really got to me.  Yeah, during the changing of the guard.  Yeah, that really got to me.  Yeah, they played the Star Spangled Banner.  That's amazing.  When Lady Di, you know, died, the outpouring of love and support.  Remember how many flowers?  It was like, what, five feet high?  Yeah.  Where is the memorial for the victims here?  Hey, you know, I'll never slam the Brits on that front.  They support us.  They know.  You know, they're a small little island over there.  Very powerful. 
[00:28:00]  But the alliance between us and the British is amazing considering how, you know, we had  our little tiffs in the past.  But where is the main memorial in New York City where people can go and drop off their  flowers?  People are still shocked.  And, dude, it's all over the city.  In Brooklyn, you can't pass by a firehouse without stopping and looking and going, oh,  my God, candles, flowers, people just stopping by to look at the firemen and shake their hands. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, these are the modern day real superheroes, you know?  If you saw Superman or Batman walking down the street, you'd be like, oh, man, dude, thank  God for what you did.  And, you know, you'd shake his hand.  These people are walking around with all due cause like superheroes.  And people just want to acknowledge them and get close to them and touch them because  of the job they're doing.  And that outpouring is shown all over the city.  You cannot pass a firehouse without seeing it lit up with candles and flowers and people 
[00:29:00]  just piled up in front of the places going to meet these firemen.  They're heroes, man.  Very cool.  All right.  Well, this is what we're going to do.  We're back to playing commercials.  It's not business as usual, though, or something we got to do because we can't survive.  They got to pay our 30 million dollar salary.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's it.  Jesus, man.  But we're not doing live reads for a while. 
[00:29:30]  More time for foosball.  Yeah, exactly.  My escape.  France is its own country.  Ugh.  Yeah.  But by whose grace, ours.  That creeper really annoyed me.  When we come back, we got lots to do today.  There's a list going around of songs that radio stations shouldn't be playing.  Here comes a penzel.  Throw a souffle at him.  Tool.  There's a list of songs that radio stations should not be playing.  Yeah.  And some of these songs on this list just don't make sense. 
[00:30:00]  Some of them would genuinely probably be disturbing to a lot of people.  Right.  You know?  But there are some in there that, wow, they really kind of got deep into the list and it  doesn't make much sense.  Right.  And we'll go through a few of those, I guess.  Well, we got to do this carefully because we don't want people to think we're goofing  on it.  No.  This is what's happening.  We're just talking about what's happening out there.  But this was sent to us just before the show and interesting.  Like, why Smooth Criminal by Alien Air Farm? 
[00:30:30]  Because it's criminal.  Like, anything with something like that.  But you're looking too much into it, no?  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  If I heard that song on the radio while I'm driving around, I wouldn't think twice about  it.  You know?  I mean, there's other ones like Van Halen Jump.  Hello.  Okay.  Of course.  Or Blow Up the Outside World from Soundgarden.  There's a whole list.  We'll talk about that next.  Okay?  And more of your phone calls.  Wow.  Don't even have to give out the number.  Fantastic.  You guys rock.  We'll be back.  You guys have redefined debauchery. 
[00:31:00]  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, this just in.  And seriously, it seems like the Italians have changed their mind again.  Just like in World War II, they switched sides. 
[00:31:30]  This coming from Reuters, Rome.  Italy ready to deploy troops and aircraft if requested to do so by its allies in response  to the terror attacks on the United States.  Defense Minister Antonio Martino said Monday.  So this is his latest response.  Apparently, someone had gotten to him and said, hey, ass.  Asked if Italy would join a military response to the attacks.  Martino told Reuters in an interview, yes, absolutely. 
[00:32:00]  We stand solidly behind our American allies.  We are loyal to our commitment to NATO, and we will do anything we can to participate in  a response to this unacceptable, terrible act of terrorism.  He added, we will do anything we are asked to do.  We will deploy troops if we are asked to do that.  We will use aircraft if we are asked to do that.  So it seems that somebody must have gone in and said, look, you bastard.  Somebody has photos of him with a young boy.  This is a big difference between I feel I'm in a position to categorically exclude calling 
[00:32:30]  on the Army.  Well, that's good news.  Yeah, sure.  We got the Italian Army.  But like I said before, what the hell does that consist of?  All right.  Well, here we are.  We don't know what to do at our radio show.  So it's simple as this.  You know, what are you guys feeling?  What are you guys thinking?  Give us a call, OK?  And we'll just go with the flow here.  I can't take any more.  I can't take any more.  Dude, I looked.  I was down there.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Thank you.  You know, I appreciate that.  You know, we went through that all last week.  But unless it's some different take on this whole thing, I can't sit here and listen to  people in misery.  The one thing that's getting me is the fact that everyone pretty much will tell you that  they were supposed to be in the World Trade Center.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Enough.  Pete Radovich brought that up last week, and he's so right.  I can't tell you how many people came up to me.  Dude, I usually do deliveries at the World Trade Center.  Yeah.  Every day at 1130. 
[00:33:30]  Well, that means you would have been safe.  Yeah.  So you're not even close.  Dude?  Yes.  O&A?  Yeah.  I just want to tell you, man, Tuesday, I was actually supposed to go to work at a small  farmhouse in Texas, but I didn't go there.  Just think if something bad would have happened there where I was, and I didn't end up going. 
[00:34:00]  Could have been me, man.  What?  I'm sick of it.  It's true.  Yeah.  You know, I once went to the World Trade Center on a class trip when I was nine.  Yeah, so?  Everyone loves to bring themselves closer to tragedy for some sick friggin' reason.  There's some real stories out there.  In the paper today, a guy's alive because a huge giant fan flew to Denver for the Monday  night game.  Really?  The only reason he's alive. 
[00:34:30]  No doubt in his mind.  He worked on like the 104th floor.  And then they had a story over the weekend, a lady was fired Monday.  Fired?  Fired Monday.  Wow.  Doesn't come to work Tuesday.  She's alive.  Wow.  Imagine that.  See, that's like one of those stories.  But someone's saying, you know, wow, I would have been there if I would have had any reason  to go.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Interesting. 
[00:35:00]  Great.  Great.  Great.  You know what, though?  I got to confess, I'm a watery little worm.  I did the same thing.  Did you?  Yeah.  There's no comedy club there?  No, I didn't mean to do it.  But no, it wasn't with that.  It was they were finding out where they had arrested guys.  Yeah.  They got a couple of guys that had resided in Fort Lee.  Mm-hmm.  And that's two towns over for me, about ten minutes.  And that's the first thing I said to somebody was, dude, that's ten minutes from me.  Ten minutes.  See?  God, you suck.  Like, that was part of the mission, to get a little chubby, impotent comedian.  I really should not have mentioned that. 
[00:35:30]  Everybody wants to be right where it happened.  That's our way.  You should be happy you had nothing to do with it.  And you weren't there.  Let's go to Keith the Cop, who's been helping us out through this whole thing.  Keith.  Gentlemen, what's going on?  How are you, sir?  Heading into work.  All right.  Seems like I'm always heading into work these days.  Yeah.  Finally, Saturday, I got a day off, and I just went home and slept for what it seemed like all day.  Yeah, I slept all weekend, off and on. 
[00:36:00]  Non-stop sleep.  And, you know, things are coming along.  You know, guys are in good spirits.  We've got a lot of help and everything.  Is it true that people are stealing from the Salvation Army?  We were hearing the reports that there were people coming in, and they were, you know, taking things from various locations.  Son of a bitch.  Scumbags.  Should be shot on sight.  And they say, you know, on a regular day that you and I are twisted.  Yeah.  There are some sick Fs out there. 
[00:36:30]  And I don't care.  You can't be caught stealing from the Salvation Army and go, I didn't know what it was for.  I didn't know what was happening.  I didn't know that there was some emergency that this was needed for.  Stealing from the Salvation Army, Ben.  Yeah.  Even worse, down in the area where everything's going on, on Greenwich Street there, some of the restaurants were giving out free food to the firefighters.  There were idiot civilians grabbing the food and eating.  I swear to God, they were not working there.  It's a friggin' buffet that you just walked out and free eats.  Eating pasta, just looking up at the buildings. 
[00:37:00]  They had nothing to do there.  I could not believe that.  And this is all for emergency workers that have been there.  And, you know, people suck.  Yeah.  People just suck.  And say that to you.  They go, oh, can I just grab a sandwich?  Or, oh, can I just get something to drink?  And you look at them like, get uptown and buy it.  Yeah.  We need people to start spending money in this city.  Unbelievable.  Go buy something.  That's how you can help.  Go and buy something.  I was saying earlier, we can never run a-hole free. 
[00:37:30]  It doesn't matter what situation is, how horrible it is, or how much you tell a group of people something.  One person will always F up, and they will be the a-hole.  It happens all the time.  It used to happen even in school, where you'd sit around and get a crowd of people or a classroom together  and instruct them all on how to do something.  There'd be one person back going, I forgot.  Or, I don't know, what?  Walking left when they're supposed to go right.  And in the airports now, get this, someone was actually arrested at one of the area airports 
[00:38:00]  because he made a bomb joke in the airport.  Online.  Which would get you taken in under regular circumstances.  Yeah, before Tuesday.  Before Tuesday.  Now, what kind of nut goes, hey, this is a great joke.  Hey, I hope that you don't find my bomb.  Hey, I hope, oh, go, go.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Ow.  Ow, it's a joke.  What?  What's wrong with you? 
[00:38:30]  You can't even get the word bomb out.  No, no.  A bit.  Oh.  Right.  And then they wonder why they got the guy's knee in the back of his neck pulling his arm  up by the top of his head.  Good for you.  There are such a huge amount of idiots on this planet.  All right, Keith, anything else?  Yeah, just real quick.  You got to say thank you to everybody.  I mean, the stuff coming in is absolutely incredible, coming in from all over the place.  Yeah.  And oddly enough, last night we were at one of the locations.  We were guarding supplies as they were coming in. 
[00:39:00]  And I got to reach out to whatever fan sent it.  But there wasn't a pallet shrimp wrapped with wow stickers on it.  Oh, cool.  So if that came in from someplace outside.  Thank God they got their wow stickers.  What the hell is that going to do?  Oh, I'm kind of losing that stick.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, so listen.  We're not really worried about wow stickers.  Yeah, well, is there somebody donating wow stickers?  How about if you can eat or drink and it's good? 
[00:39:30]  If you can wear it, good.  If you were from outside the New York area and you sent that in, though, hey, it got you.  All right, cool.  And it's well received, so greatly appreciated.  All right, Keith, say hi to the gang down there.  We most certainly will.  We'll talk to you.  Right on, bro.  Bye.  There it goes.  Keep the cop.  I'm disgusted.  Can't we get beer for those guys, though?  Have we gotten in touch with anyone from Sam Adams?  We found out they need beer.  That's something that could help these guys.  Let's get Jim Cook right on the horn or something like that and go directly to the boss because 
[00:40:00]  he's the guy.  I know if we ask him for kegs and kegs of beer to be sent down here, we will make sure  they get to the firemen and policemen.  We'll roll the kegs right down the middle of Broadway.  Yeah, because you know something?  Even I've heard everything they put out, these people have come to the table and gotten  them the clothes and the eye wash and just the hundreds of things that these guys need  to pull this off.  But we also got to think about these guys when they get off duty and have that short  time to try to unwind and relax. 
[00:40:30]  They're going to need beers, man.  Hell, I've hung out in enough firehouses to know those guys run on beer.  So if we could get Jim Cook from Sam Adams on the horn and get some kegs down there, I think  that would be something we could do.  Mike had a good story.  He did?  Yeah, he hung up.  Where'd he go?  Well, he's sick of all the, you know, I was supposed to be there stories.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, please, enough. 
[00:41:00]  And then there's also the radio whore guys that I've listened to a lot of radio this  past week, you know, switching around the stations in the truck and whatnot.  And you hear the same people telling the same stories on three, four different stations.  We've had some callers that have called us and I've heard them on the way home on other  stations telling the same thrilling story.  They turn it into their 15 minutes of fame and it's obscene.  Jim, what do you have? 
[00:41:30]  Hey, I was listening to the radio all day and hearing how everyone's still saying, buy,  buy, buy, go out and buy stuff and everything.  And hearing how if you have stock not to sell this, that and the other thing.  Well, I never really invested in the stock market, but I think today, now would actually  be a good time to do it.  And I wonder if you had any advice.  As far as what stocks would be good.  Well, who the hell knows?  The Dow looks like it's going to close at about 650 points down. 
[00:42:00]  By the way, stock broker Dave nailed it.  Nailed it.  Yeah.  Everyone else is saying that it's going to be just fine.  Dave's like, no, we are going to take a major hit.  I mean, everyone sold their airline stock.  And can you blame them at this point?  You know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you can blame them.  You should have held on to it.  But the market runs on emotion.  I mean, you can't be too confident about your airline stock right now.  And they took a big loss on it.  It's going to be a great buy tomorrow.  Dude, you want a good tip?  Yeah.  Endicott Steel. 
[00:42:30]  What was that?  Endicott Steel?  I don't know, Jim.  I don't know what to tell you with that one.  I mean, you know, I'm in for the long haul.  You know what the problem is?  It's not just Americans in the stock market.  There are a lot of international companies that buy into the market.  And they don't have that sense of pride behind it to hold on to the stock.  They're just in it.  You know, we could sit there and know that it's going to hurt for a while to hold these stocks.  But the international companies that are in the market just, they sell. 
[00:43:00]  They want out.  Jim, what I can tell you, we're going to probably get Stockbroker Dave on the line when the market closes.  So we'll see what the vibe was down there.  And I'll ask him.  And don't underestimate the greed of Americans and other people around the world.  Because if the market plunges 700 points in one day, you're guaranteed you're going to get that dead cat bounce, they call it, the buyback the next day.  Right.  Which I think you're going to see.  It's going to be looked at as a buy opportunity. 
[00:43:30]  Jim, I mean, what I would suggest, and a lot of people are saying this, just spend money in New York City.  There are so many businesses that need the help.  I went out to dinner with, I hope he doesn't mind that I say this on the air, but Joey Paisano and his wife.  And I go, Joey, so what's the deal down in Little Italy?  He goes, dude, we're all nervous.  I go, how long can you last?  He goes, maybe four weeks.  Maybe four weeks.  And then he's got to close his restaurant, possibly.  Whoa.  And I go, they already canceled the feast, which is just a huge moneymaker for Little Italy. 
[00:44:00]  The San Gennaro feast.  He says he gets so much business from the towers and all the surrounding buildings and Wall Street and the tourists.  There's no tourists in New York.  No.  He depends on the tourists to come to Little Italy and have dinner at his restaurant, not counting the people that listen to our show.  I mean, right on the street here on 57th, we see those stupid double-decker tour bus every day.  Now I wish I could see one of those buses filled with people.  I'd feel a little better.  Instead, they're going by with no people on them. 
[00:44:30]  You've got to support businesses, especially down in lower Manhattan.  The restaurants and whatever, man.  Spend money down there.  Help the guys out because they are freaking out.  It wasn't just the people that lost their lives in the towers, man.  There are so many people that are affected by this.  All right, Jim.  All right.  Hey, one other thing.  On the way to Afghanistan, let's make a slight detour, drop a bomb on France, and watch the Italians scatter like rats. 
[00:45:00]  Now the Italians are supporting us.  Now the Italians are on the bandwagon.  Yeah, they're supporting us until they see the first bomb dropped, and we'll watch who's the first one to run.  But the dastardly French, the cowardly French, the nation of France, full of pussies, once again turning their backs on the country that bailed them out of World War II.  We should just fly over France and drop deodorant.  They really are awful, but they're their own country.  How about dropping some roll-on? 
[00:45:30]  Some laser-guided roll-on to just hit their armpits.  Creepy.  Mikey, you're next.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  This ain't Mikey.  This is Jay.  Who?  Oh, Jay from earlier.  Yeah.  I'm telling you guys this.  Yeah.  I'm, like, really pissed off right now.  I pulled over on the side of the road.  You guys are saying way too much stuff.  About?  Just the French and the Italians.  Dude, you are making no sense.  Hey, we love the Italians now.  You're just babbling along. 
[00:46:00]  The French are still cowardly, a nation of cowards that don't know how to support the people that  saved their asses.  Do you understand what's coming out of your mouth?  Do you understand what you're saying?  Yes, Jay.  Absolutely.  Well, if it wasn't for the French.  I think it's quite accurate.  If it wasn't for the French, yeah.  Go ahead.  No, listen.  Listen.  Go ahead.  If it wasn't for the French, we would be speaking German.  I know you're saying, hell no, blah, blah, blah.  What?  You suck.  F you.  I can't even talk to this guy.  If it wasn't for the French, we'd be speaking German. 
[00:46:30]  Our buddy Jim Cook, everyone.  It wasn't the French landing on our beaches, getting cut to pieces, you son of a bitch.  Jim?  Ass.  Yes.  How are you, sir?  Well, I'm good.  How are you guys?  Sorry you had to hear that.  We're a little uptight around the New York area.  So, you know, you can see why.  Well, at least Jay yelled F you.  You've got to give him credit for that.  At least he kept the radio clean.  What a dope.  Well, how are you feeling, Jim?  It's a little bit weird. 
[00:47:00]  Even here in Boston, it's strange because it made everybody polite, you know?  People are linked to each other.  For a few minutes, anyway.  You know human nature, though.  Yeah.  I stopped for a pedestrian.  I almost got rear-ended.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Now, how are your wounds healing from your bicycle accident?  Well, you know, the events of the last week make falling off your bike and breaking your  wrist pretty trivial. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  It puts things in perspective, that's for sure.  Yeah.  It hardly dampened my beer drinking, and I have no regrets.  Well, Jim, we actually have a favor to ask of you if you could be so kind.  Sure.  We figured we'd take it right to the top.  The emergency workers down by where the World Trade Center was doing the cleanup and the  rescue and recovery effort, the firefighters, the cops, they're working their asses off down  there.  And a lot of deliveries cannot get into lower Manhattan.  And these guys have a short time every night or day, depending on what their shift is, to 
[00:48:00]  unwind a little bit.  And you know firefighters and cops like sitting down and blowing off some steam with some beers.  It seems they're running out of beer in lower Manhattan for these guys.  And we figured maybe we could get in touch with you and see if you couldn't help them out a little  bit with some kegs.  Oh, absolutely.  That sounds like tragedy piled on tragedy.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, because I've been in enough firehouses, man, and beer is a priority with firefighters 
[00:48:30]  and with the cops.  Well, not only that, it keeps the radical Muslims away.  You know, they think beer is bad.  That's true.  Yes.  We could use it as a deterrent.  Spray some Sam Adams on them.  They'd shrivel up like cockroaches.  You've got to love this guy.  Well, that's great.  I'm sure we'll work it out logistically and figure out how we can get that down there 
[00:49:00]  as soon as possible.  Yeah, that is really bad news.  Yeah.  But I think we can fix that.  God, those guys deserve, you know, to have a beer after 12 hours of going through the rubble  with, you know, things you and I would never see in our life.  I know.  And, boy, if anyone didn't need a tall, cold one.  Yeah.  Then the rest of it will bomb over Afghanistan with the...  Yeah, just throw some beer on them.  They'll run scurrying.  Your unholy brew in their eyes. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Then capture them, torture them by, you know, making them drink Sam Adams and eat bacon cheeseburgers.  Drop the empty kegs right on Bin Laden's head.  Fall, fall.  Yeah, fall.  All right.  Well, hold on, Jim, and we'll get Ben or Rick to talk to you and see if we can't set something  up.  Well, this guy, Doc, is saying that there's no alcohol allowed at the site.  Well, it's going to...  Not at the site.  We're not talking about them pounded beers at the site, you dick. 
[00:50:00]  We're talking about getting some beer into some of these bars that are cut off from  deliveries.  Yeah, because they're going to the bars outside Ground Zero to, you know, let off some steam  and we're finding out that they're running out of beer.  Yeah, I watched the news clips and I just saw them pounding beers at the rubble site.  Idiot.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Jim, hold on the line, all right?  You got it.  Thank you.  Always a man.  God, we got to talk like we're speaking to kindergartners. 
[00:50:30]  Jim, that was another reference to Wall Street.  You bastard.  What?  The Endicott Steel?  Endicott Steel.  Jeremy from Long Island.  Nice, obscure reference of the day.  Endicott Steel was one of the stocks mentioned in the movie Wall Street.  Nice.  Thanks to Jeremy.  Nice.  He got it.  All right, we should take...  All right, someone tell me where this stock is from.  Canadian Allied Petroleum.  There you go.  That's your little mission.  Tell me where that was from.  Continental Divide.  No, no.  Rick knows?  Don't say it.  I just want to see if anyone gets it. 
[00:51:00]  Just do it on instant feedback, not on the phone lines.  Canadian...  Canadian Allied Petroleum.  Yeah.  I don't think I'm around.  No?  No.  Well, the answer next.  A little tease.  There you go.  That'll keep people...  We'll be back with more of your phone calls.  Exactly.  Cliffhanger.  Hey, man, what are you guys...  What are you guys feeling?  Let us know.  Give us a call.  Hey!  Working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things sonic bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll. 
[00:51:30]  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is...  This station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  A little taste of the latest one from Butthole Surfers.  Shame of life.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're not in the New York area and you're trying to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:52:00]  866-277-4WOW.  Sipping in today, our buddy Jim Norton.  Yes, ma'am.  I hope Tom from Teaneck was the first guy to get the Canadian Allied Petroleum.  What show it was from?  It's from I Love Lucy.  Yes, I Love Lucy.  Remember the one where Ricky thought Lucy was spending too much money?  So he got a business manager that was now going to take care of all the bills and give Lucy an allowance.  But it wasn't enough for Lucy to, like, live with. 
[00:52:30]  So she went around to the whole apartment building and decided she would ask people what they wanted.  She'd go down to the store and buy it for them.  She would take the money that they gave them and put it on credit.  Now, the business manager's problem is how to pay for the food that is on credit because it's not Lucy's problem.  You know, they got the business manager now.  So she had all this money and she's, like, whipping all this money out in front of Ricky.  And Ricky's like, how the hell did Lucy get all this money?  So one day he sees a slip of paper.  It says, buy can all pet.  That was by the phone. 
[00:53:00]  So what it was was Lucy was talking to one of the other people in the apartment building and they needed a can of all pet dog food or something like that, pet food.  But the way she wrote it looked like a stock tip.  So Ricky goes, oh, my God, Fred, Lucy's playing the stock market.  Well, we got to get in on this, Rick.  You know?  So they bought Canadian Allied Petroleum, just happened to be there.  Can all pet, Canadian Allied Petroleum.  And then they found out that Lucy had actually just been buying groceries and that's where it was.  And they had bought a whole bunch of stock in Canadian Allied Petroleum. 
[00:53:30]  But then they sold it.  And I think they were happy that they broke even or might have lost a little money.  And what happened after they sold it?  Went right up.  Oh, it shot up.  They struck a gusher and...  And?  Yes.  Do you ever go outside?  Never, ever.  It's dangerous out there.  I watch TV.  You actually do a William Frawley impression.  Hey, Rick.  Remember that?  He was always, well, we're going to see some girls tonight. 
[00:54:00]  Want to go to the fight, Rick?  Rick, my favorite, when they're all in the car driving to California and Ricky starts,  California, here I come.  Right back where I started from.  And Fred starts going, and Ethel's like, oh, oh.  It was horrific.  And I loved every minute of it.  I heard he was a real alcoholic.  Oh, and they hated...  Right, right.  Vivian Vance and William Frawley hated each other.  And he was, like, tanked on the set all the time with his belt up to his nipples. 
[00:54:30]  Didn't he refer to her as the sea?  That's what somebody...  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  There are rumors.  Yeah, I read that.  That he had called her, or used to call her that a lot.  The sea.  The sea.  God bless William Frawley.  I never saw that in the credits.  With William Frawley and the sea.  Hey, Rick, we need to get Stockbroker Dave on the line.  The market's closed.  We've got to see what the vibe was down there.  Also, Anthony?  Yes.  I'm convinced that we have cloned the mayor of New York City. 
[00:55:00]  Cloned him?  Cloned him.  Hmm.  He has been everywhere.  Oh, that's right.  When is this guy sleeping?  It's amazing.  In the last 48 hours, he's been to two or three funerals.  It's in the paper today.  He gave away a bride yesterday.  He was at a memorial service.  And then he's on one of the news stations talking that he read a book called Five Days in London.  Yeah.  About the bombings in England during World War II.  And he got some inspiration from this book. 
[00:55:30]  And he told everyone.  And because he said that, all the bookstores, by the way, sold out of this book.  Yeah.  Because everyone ran out and got it.  I guess they were done buying the Nostradamus books.  Nostradamus.  There's signs in Barnes & Noble were sold out of Nostradamus books.  Really?  Yeah.  People ran out and bought them.  That one quote that they were sending around in email was completely wrong.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  It was totally made, like, based maybe on what was written in the real book.  But they kind of changed it. 
[00:56:00]  Well, they cut and pasted.  Yeah.  To make it make sense to the situation we were in last Tuesday.  That's ridiculous.  But the mayor has just been amazing.  He's reading books.  He's going to funerals.  He's going to memorial services.  He's giving away brides.  He's hanging with the president.  No matter what time I turn on the TV news, he's live somewhere.  He's turned into Zellig.  Yeah.  He's everywhere.  Look in every picture.  Love that movie.  Woody Allen.  Nice.  He's everywhere.  Pretty amazing.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  The mayor.  Now they're debating on whether to keep him in office for another year.  Because they think there might be a little too much crisis going on to get a new mayor in there.  He's got to stay in office.  Now, there's a whole thing there, though, where you don't want what happened to affect elections, you know,  because we want to get back to this normalcy everybody wants to get back to.  But, on the other hand, you don't want the city handed over to a new mayor when we're in crisis mode.  You know, you want somebody who knows every nook and cranny of this place has relationships, 
[00:57:00]  very close relationships, with the people that really need to be in contact with the mayor.  So, you know, it's kind of a double-edged sword thing.  I personally think, yeah, they should, it's extraordinary circumstances and not bowing down to terrorism that they stopped us from having an election.  But I think it is in the best interest of the city to keep Giuliani in there for another year.  He's been one hell of a leader through this whole thing.  We've mentioned a bunch of times. 
[00:57:30]  He knows the place on the show.  Yeah.  On a side note, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, yeah, we noticed you're at every single location.  Now go away.  Do you just picture them in a hotel at night, her with a leather collar and a leash,  and Schumer with that The Gimp leather suit on and that red ball in his mouth,  just whipping each other and loving themselves in a democratic frenzy of love?  I've seen no leadership skills from Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer through this whole damn thing.  Yeah.  None whatsoever.  All I see is two politicians looking for photo ops. 
[00:58:00]  Bingo.  Especially, now I am totally no fan of Hillary.  She's as much a whore as Schumer.  But Schumer could be the worst ever.  He will make sure those cameras are clicking.  He tries to come off like a leader.  And he's Hillary's lapdog is what he is.  He's always there, nose just nestled in her crack. 
[00:58:30]  No matter where she turns up, there's Chuck Schumer.  Well, she's done a lot, though, since it's happened.  You know, he's really galvanized people into action.  Yeah, right.  They're down on Wall Street today, ringing the opening bell while they're on the platform,  while the real heroes are ringing the opening bell.  And there's Chuck Schumer and Hillary.  Oh, Christ.  They have to be everywhere.  They had no business being there.  I'm surprised Hillary knew where it was.  And she's been such a big supporter of the cops.  I mean, you know, it's always Hillary to rush in the cops' defense.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:59:00]  Wouldn't she not allow police escorts or something when she was campaigning in certain areas?  She didn't want police, uniformed police officers escorting her?  It looked bad to who she believed her constituency was going to be.  So, yeah, she didn't want cops around her to give her that stigma that police officers give you.  What?  Whore.  Let's move on to Stockbroker Dave.  Dave.  I'm watching them all leave the floor right now, boys.  What, Chuck Schumer and Hillary?  Hillary.  What, they had to be there for the closing bell, too? 
[00:59:30]  He's short.  There goes Dick Rosso.  Right.  Billy Johnson.  There they go.  The photo op over.  The photo op.  Those cameras everywhere.  The whores.  You look at people like George Pataki and Giuliani,  who have really taken the reins and turned a disaster into something that works.  You know, they keep the city rolling during the unthinkable.  And then you look at Hillary and the likes of Chuck Schumer, 
[01:00:00]  and they're there making sure they're in front of cameras doing nothing.  Nothing.  They're trying to take responsibility for getting the $40 billion that the federal government's going to give to New York.  You don't think the federal government was watching?  You don't think they knew that the city needed some cash?  So they get in front of the cameras.  We have asked the federal government for relief funds of $40 billion for the city of New York. 
[01:00:30]  Act, act, act, act, act.  You won, you fat-thied whore.  You won.  You could get the campaign voice off.  And I believe that this city will once again take its place in the world of the president.  G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g.  Got a little hating you, huh?  And I think Chuck Schumer should remove his nose from my mouth. 
[01:01:00]  G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g!  Hoo-ah!  Dave, what was it like from the opening bell till now down there on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange?  What a ride.  Get in was emotional.  There was a strong military presence, and you had to show not only your stock exchange badge, but your license.  And then when everybody sorted, there was five guys that lost their lives down here, so it was a little emotional. 
[01:01:30]  They happened to be having breakfast on Windows of the World, a once-a-year occurrence.  Yeah, I heard about that.  It was once a year they opened the place.  I mean, if we have breakfast meetings, usually it's in the building, and two guys took three of their clerks, and they went for breakfast on the Windows of the World, and they're gone now.  And it was a little emotional.  Yeah.  Everybody was just a lot of hugging.  It was just two minutes of silence, and then we sang God Bless America, and then they crapped on them from the opening bell. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, and then...  That was it.  It was just like you couldn't get away from them.  Now, do you have any line on where most of the money was being pulled out of?  Obviously, the airline got decimated.  Yeah.  Decimated.  Insurance companies got decimated.  Some of the financials acted okay.  Fannie Mae, I was in.  I bought a boatload for...  I don't know.  Fannie Mae was up two bucks on the day. 
[01:02:30]  But in general, I'm looking at the boards right now.  Everything's red.  The market was down, the Dow's...  684.  684, and NASDAQ...  NASDAQ was down 116.  Charlie, what was the volume?  Huge volume today.  2,300,000,000 is the final...  2,000,000...  Busiest day.  300,000,000.  Busiest day ever.  Busiest day ever.  Yeah.  A lot of shit.  It's damn close.  But Dave, you called it, so...  I thought they were going to act okay open. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I thought that was going to be a little more of a recovery.  I thought they were going to hit them on the opening, and then I thought there would be some sort of recovery, but they're closed on the bottom.  Now, is there any way to tell who or what organizations were really pulling their money out?  It was a lot of international...  When you see, but this is what we've been waiting for.  Yeah.  You know, my father, he told me, it's over, it's over, it's over.  I said, Dad, he told me, it's never over until it's an inordinate amount of volume.  Now you're down 700 points on 2 billion shares. 
[01:03:30]  That's a flush out.  Right.  That's a flush out.  I mean, it wasn't, you know, a bear market.  Just get it over with.  To me, this is a flush out.  So, come on, I'd be comfortable buying anything.  Yeah, I was saying, never underestimate people's greed.  This is a great place to get in now.  I think it's a perfect buying opportunity, unfortunately.  These airlines, they got decimated.  Can I ask a question?  Like, a lot of people I know, I don't know much about the stock market. 
[01:04:00]  When people pull money out, are they actually doing the right thing, or are they just being greedy?  Jimmy, it's not people that we care about, unfortunately.  Because basically, if Jim Norton's in the market, it's not going to be in effect.  It's mutual funds.  It's a big fund.  The institutional trade.  The institutional.  They can't have it on the books.  You've got certain stocks.  They can't have airlines on their books right now.  Right.  So, they just get out.  They don't give a damn about the price.  Just get me out.  But there was a lot of institutional selling today, which is great. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  It was great.  Just get it over with.  That's it.  You're flushed.  Now, we can get on with our lives.  Yeah, this, you know, dropping almost 700 points doesn't really reflect the economic attitude  in the country.  It really was based on the disaster that happened on Tuesday.  Exactly.  So, I don't think it's a bad move to start buying in now.  I agree with you, Anthony.  I think I just kept waiting and waiting for that big two billion share day, and we got 
[01:05:00]  it today.  Yeah.  And you got a lot of, you know, a lot of stocks on the bulls of their ass, and now's the  time to step up.  You guys going drinking now?  I am going.  Unfortunately, you know what today is, though?  Huh?  Rosh Hashanah.  Ah, yeah.  You know, I think I'm your only Jewish friend.  Is that true?  That's not true, isn't it?  We like the Jews.  I'm trying to think.  Let me think.  We like the Jews.  We like the Jews.  The Jew.  What other Jews do you hang out with?  Voss.  Voss. 
[01:05:30]  I have to get home and not.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I have one friend.  One Jewish friend.  You.  And go figure.  He works with money.  Boy.  Boy.  Boy.  Boy.  And this guy is good with his money.  Whenever we need it, he gives it to us.  You boys are the best.  Well, Dave, keep us updated on what goes on there.  We're going to be watching.  I love you, boys.  Say hi, Dave.  And I appreciate the call the other day.  It really meant a lot.  Yeah, we were wondering about it.  I had a very tough week, and a lot of people on the floor came over to me and said they heard  me, and they said, you know, they really care about you. 
[01:06:00]  And a lot of guys were listening and said that they did a good job through a tough time.  Yeah, say hi to the gang, all right?  I will, boys.  All right, bro.  Be well, okay?  See you soon, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Stockbroker Dave, everyone.  There he goes.  Our eyes and ears on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Took a beating today.  But I don't think it's going to be a bad thing.  Because, like I said, it's not based on the climate in the country, you know, the economic  climate.  It's based on what happened Tuesday.  So this big drop, you're going to see that void filled with a lot of people buying for 
[01:06:30]  the rest of the week.  That's what I think.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  I'm calling in.  I'm from Cleveland.  I'm somewhat removed from the tragedy.  I've never seen the World Trade Center live.  I've got to tell you, I don't think anyone is that removed from this tragedy.  Not that removed.  I mean, we have the terminal tower in Cleveland.  And if that was in ruins, I could only guess what we would be like around here.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  Even if you're not from New York and haven't seen the World Trade Center towers live, I  realized this weekend you cannot watch a goddamn movie that has even a scene in New York in 
[01:07:00]  it or a TV show based in New York or something without the towers being in it.  It's amazing.  I played a video game over this weekend that had the World Trade Center towers in the background.  I understand exactly what you mean.  And the Spider-Man movie coming out next year.  Yeah.  They've got to reshoot scenes of that.  Any New York-based movie or TV show, those are featured prominently.  It's amazing.  I say they leave those scenes in the movies as a tribute. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Like Spider-Man.  That would be a good idea.  Yeah.  Why not?  I don't know.  Would that be too depressing?  And I'm never for censoring or editing.  But would that be too depressing to watch?  I don't know.  It's kind of like, you know, there they were.  We all know they were there.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We all know they were there anyway.  We all know they were there.  It's not like if they take them out, it's going to be more noticeable if they're gone.  You know what?  They took them out.  They're going to be back there.  Every time I see that shot, I'm like, God damn it.  Every time I see them missing, it just enrages me.  I drive past them every day that I come in here. 
[01:08:00]  I have to drive past, and I am the width of the river away.  I am the width of the river away.  And I get the entire view.  And those being gone, you forget how big they were.  You look at pictures of the towers and how much taller than the surrounding buildings they were.  And then as I'm passing by, I look live and go, I can't picture where they ended, you know?  You kind of forget.  You know what's weird?  Someone sent me a picture today from, I guess, the mid-60s, this girl and her family, I guess, on the Brooklyn side over there. 
[01:08:30]  Before they were built?  Before they were built.  Yeah.  Which is the exact same landscape as it is now.  And it was just very strange because there's the family all happy going, look, here's the city skyline behind us.  I saw it without the Twin Towers.  This was like 1967 or something.  Yeah, they were built in 1970.  They were finished.  Can I tell you one more thing out there?  And she even said that if you look close, you could tell that they had just started building them.  Yeah, quickly.  How do you think France would respond if somebody knocked down the Eiffel Tower? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, they surrender.  I just got one more thing.  That guy, Jay, who called in before?  I called in the first day you guys were on the air and talked about you being worse than Alien Ant Farm.  Yeah.  His friends will recognize his voice.  They should all thump him tonight.  Not bad.  Just enough to make him go, ow, that hurts.  All right, Chris.  Thanks.  Thank you.  I was watching another news program, and they were talking about the towers, and when they were first built, the people in New York City did not accept them.  They didn't like them. 
[01:09:30]  They didn't fit in with the skyline of New York City.  If you look at the Empire State Building, this is what they were saying.  The surrounding buildings come up around the Empire State Building, and the building is sort of like the peak of the mountain of midtown Manhattan.  And the same thing down with lower Manhattan.  And then these two buildings just shot up out of nowhere.  Taller than anything.  Right.  And totally architecturally different than the traditional skyscraper that was taking up the Manhattan skyline.  And there was something written in the lower Manhattan, I don't even know what you would call it, the code, the building code, that no other building built around the Trade Center could be taller than half the size of the Trade Center. 
[01:10:00]  It was not allowed by the building committee because they wanted those towers to just be taller than anything else around them.  And New Yorkers originally couldn't stand those things.  But then, you know, especially after the first bombing in 1993, people were just like, you know, that became a symbol of you can't kick our ass. 
[01:10:30]  You can't...  You can't hurt us.  Yeah, and then now they're just gone.  There's a guy that just hung up.  If he was for real, he's got a call back.  Something about Bill Butel, one of the local news guys, an older gent, getting hosed down by the NYPD.  Really?  That would be great.  Because he was messing around too much at Ground Zero.  I want to know if that's true and if it was on live TV or not.  They should turn the fire hoses on the press that's down.  I would just love that on certain members of the press.  One of the guys from Channel 2 got arrested because he's trying to sneak where he's not supposed to. 
[01:11:00]  There's no reason to sneak.  What kind of exclusive are you going to get?  You want to take pictures and video of more suffering than people have seen already?  What do you need, that exclusive shot of them pulling somebody out?  Would you please just let them do their work?  Unbelievable, these reporters.  They want that extra special thing no one else has.  And at this point, the only thing you can get that's special is more tragedy.  So just let it go.  You're not going to find more of it.  Yeah, what a bunch of tools, man. 
[01:11:30]  They want the award.  They want that goddamn Edward R. Murrow Award or the frigging, what is that, an Emmy for newscast?  They all want, they're all looking for that now.  How could you accept that award for your coverage of this tragedy?  Your coverage, for your coverage of this, we give you, I can't wait for the lame-ass, stupid radio air awards that come around every year to this godforsaken industry or radio. 
[01:12:00]  And up for best local coverage of the world trade, and then they'll get the schlep up there from one of the news stations to give a speech.  And they'll be like, Channel 2 for We Will Survive.  Yeah.  Channel 4 for America Under Attack.  Right.  Or Channel 7, fuck.  Whores!  We've got to take a break.  Mario Cantone on hold.  We saw him on, what show was that, Dateline?  Dateline.  He was on Dateline last night. 
[01:12:30]  Last night they spoke to them about how Caroline's down in the city, down in Manhattan, is kind of having a hard time because people don't want to go out and see comics right now feeling like this.  But I've got to ask Mario something when we get back.  I saw him on the news.  I was like, oh, Mario.  I turn around.  I look at the TV.  For some reason, Mario Cantone naked in the city, and they're talking to him.  I just saw him without his shirt on or something.  I have to ask him about this.  All right.  We'll get to the bottom of that next.  All right?  O.B. 
[01:13:00]  Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  Yeah, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Are we allowed to play this song?  I think so.  There's a whole list of songs going around that you shouldn't be playing.  Yeah.  They've put them out to a bunch of radio stations.  They deem them inappropriate.  Some of them, I'll agree with.  You know, it kind of hurts to hear some of them for people that have lost people and whatnot. 
[01:13:30]  But some of them are kind of silly.  But I guess they're erring on each side of us.  Stone Temple Pilots did make the list of songs that you should not be playing during this time of tragedy.  Yeah, they did.  S.T.P. did?  What song?  A couple songs made.  Right.  Big Bang Baby.  Yeah.  And, of course, and I am not making any jokes.  I have to say it before I even say the title of the song.  It's on the list.  It's just...  Dead and Bloated.  Yeah.  It's about what they're passing around.  These lists. 
[01:14:00]  Some of these songs are completely ridiculous.  All Rage Against the Machine songs.  Yeah.  They just said any Rage Against the Machine songs should not be played.  Should not be played.  Imagine by John Lennon is on that list.  Are you kidding?  No.  Imagine.  Because I'm only guessing because it says to kill or die for it in One of the Lives.  It's the only thing I can guess.  Like, that's what the whole thing's about.  This stupid religion and stupid friggin' people's interpretation of God.  Ugh. 
[01:14:30]  They should add other songs.  Like, you shouldn't play R.E.M., Everybody Hurts.  Why?  Personally, I don't want to hear it.  No, I know.  But if you're going to put all these other songs down there,  who wants to feel more pain than they're already feeling by, you know,  listening to these sappy songs?  Speaking of religion, let's just take a look at Reverend Jerry Falwell  and Pat Robertson's reasoning to this whole terrorist attack.  The United States was vulnerable to this week's terrorist attacks 
[01:15:00]  because the nation, the U.S., has insulted God and lost divine protection.  They're saying we've pretty much lost the condom that is God  on society's schween and opened us up to terrorist aids.  Like, if we're bad, then the protection gets pulled away.  What kind of crap is that?  God Almighty is lifting His protection from us, Robertson said. 
[01:15:30]  We have imagined ourselves invulnerable  and have been consumed by the pursuit of health, wealth, material pleasures, and sexuality.  Well, yeah!  It's called living life!  Jesus.  They blame this on everybody accepting homosexuality,  people consumed with things like cloning, abortions,  and saying that that is what is responsible for this. 
[01:16:00]  You asses!  You know what's responsible for this?  Jerry and Pat?  People exactly like you telling people about their version of God  and how to serve them.  People exactly like you.  Fanatic religious tools that go to their people,  their lemmings, their sheep,  and fill their heads with this bull crap,  your interpretation of God  and how we should be serving Him. 
[01:16:30]  What's the difference between these people  blaming homosexuality, abortions, and sex  and the people over there  saying that to serve God you should strap a bomb to yourself?  Jerry and Pat.  You're out of the same friggin' mold.  You're the same moronic, extremist morons  that are filling people's heads with crap. 
[01:17:00]  Just to imply this attack happened  because some guy is drinking out of a mule in Connecticut,  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Exactly.  Right.  Right.  Ridiculous.  Well, we got a gay guy on the line here.  No, Mario.  We're not getting to you yet.  Joseph.  Jesus Christ.  Well, Mario's on hold, too.  Joseph.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Cool show.  And when I'm seeing it,  I mean, these two pictures actually went on CNN.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they're dumping out of that.  That's cool.  Saying all this crap.  Go ahead.  I mean, they started saying 
[01:17:30]  that because of lesbians and gays  that this was some type of God punishment  and we had it coming to us.  Ugh.  It's just the same crap  that they're doing over there.  That they're doing and influencing their people.  I don't know how, as a thinking human being,  you could sit there  and rely on a fairy tale  told through 2,000 or so years  that it was conveyed accurately  when I can't get direction secondhand 
[01:18:00]  from two people  in the span of 10 seconds.  You need to tell me over 2,000 years  that even if these people did exist,  that the story has been conveyed  and all these rules and regulations  and restrictions  that have put on people are accurate.  Eat me.  I'm not buying it.  You want to believe in God?  You want to believe in God  in whatever way you want?  Hey, that's fine with me.  Make up your own interpretation  of what that is.  I happen to think 
[01:18:30]  we're just a freak accident  in a petri dish of a universe.  But, hey, I'm sorry.  That's my whole take on this thing.  Oh, man.  I got the wave file  sitting somewhere on my computer.  I'm going to email it to you guys.  To sit there and listen  to Pat Robertson  and Jerry Falwell  and think that they are  accurately conveying history  and putting it in your head  how you should act,  you're going to be  gravely disappointed  in the afterlife.  Well, you've got to listen to them, though,  because they really have their fingers 
[01:19:00]  on the pulse of the young people.  Yeah, don't they?  On society.  All right, Joseph.  Thank you.  Give me a break.  And the guy  with the Bill Butel story  is calling back.  I want to see what this is all about.  Oh, thank God.  Brian.  Yes, how are you guys?  All right, what do you have?  Well, first I'd like to say  that I'm honored  that I got the nod before  Mario Cantone,  so I appreciate that.  Oh, cool.  All right.  So I was down there  at Ground Zero  volunteering today.  You know, giving the guys food,  giving them cold drinks.  They're so appreciative.  These guys are great.  They're working hard.  They say thank you for everything. 
[01:19:30]  So we're right there.  We're about 100 yards  further than they let the media.  You know, all these guys  are trying to get in.  They're kicking them out.  And here comes J.O.  Bill Butel  and his film crew  trying to shoot shots.  They try and set up the shot  like three or four times.  The cops tell them,  no, no, no, this and that.  He's, you know,  but, but, but, but, but,  you know, arguing this and that.  All of a sudden,  you remember Police Academy  when Hooks, you know,  started getting that crowd back  and backed them into a pool?  I don't know.  This cop just went nuts.  Rode them for like 60 yards.  Everybody's going,  yeah, get back, get back.  He would not give up. 
[01:20:00]  What a leech.  So they just pushed him back?  Well, there was a rumor  that they hosed him back.  Well, there's a story.  Figuratively.  Figuratively.  Yeah.  But if you were there  and you saw this cop,  he just flipped  and it was so deserved.  This guy was pushing  and pushing.  Oh, the news media.  There's vultures.  Yeah, there are vultures.  There are a bunch of cockroaches  down there.  They're just looking  for the story  that the channel next to him  isn't carrying.  And the only thing  that they feel  is worthy of that  is to film more tragedy  and air stuff  that's inappropriate. 
[01:20:30]  And you know something?  It's just going to  increase the suffering.  And I'll tell you something.  You know me.  I'm for throwing  anything on whatsoever.  But when stuff like this  is going on downtown,  you know,  the news guys  got to back off.  Let these guys  do their job  uninhibited by these vultures  trying to get  their next award.  Yeah, but that Bill Butel  really gets in there  and gets a scoop,  doesn't he?  Oh, yeah.  He sure does.  Nobody has listened  to that stroke victim  since Colin Ferguson  shot up the LIE. 
[01:21:00]  Nobody cares  if he's living or dead.  Hey, Jim,  he's got moxie.  I would say  he's got moxie.  Let's move on  with Mario Cantone.  Mario.  Yeah, I'm sleeping now.  Thanks for making me  wait so long.  God, I'm in my bathroom  like a junkie.  I'm not leaving  this bathroom.  Now, Mario.  What?  I saw you  on Dateline.  Dateline.  I wasn't naked.  All I saw... 
[01:21:30]  I didn't have my shirt off.  I hear Mario Cantone  and I turn around  and I go,  whoa, Mario's going to be on.  So I turn,  I look at the TV,  I go,  why is Mario Cantone  naked on the streets  of Manhattan?  Why is he nude  on the streets  of New York  during this crisis?  You were shirtless?  No, I was not shirtless.  Who's telling you this?  I saw it.  It looked like...  But I watched from  across the room.  Were you wearing it?  Oh, no.  I was wearing beige.  Was it beige?  I was wearing  a very darling  beige Calvin Klein sweater  that was at 58 degrees. 
[01:22:00]  Because I look  and I'm like,  Mario's naked.  Why are they  interviewing a naked Mario?  I know.  You know what?  They called me at Carolina  and they were like,  come up here,  Dateline is here,  they want to talk to you.  I was like,  okay.  So I'm all unshaven.  I look like  Russell Crowe's  gay brother.  I mean,  I look ridiculous.  I was like,  hi.  I look too awful  and I don't even know  what I said,  but I just talked.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Yeah,  was that more of a  see-through  shirt number  you were wearing?  You're so gay.  You big faggaroo. 
[01:22:30]  Let me tell you something.  I noticed that  I could see some nippage  from Mario Cantone.  That's all my big pectorals,  you fucking.  You have a hammer.  You have a hammer.  You have a hammer.  I couldn't believe it.  Well,  let me tell you,  first of all,  we were talking about  Jerry Falwell.  Yeah.  You're so right  because you know what?  They have the same  extremist mentality  as these people.  Yes.  And you know,  it's the same reason  why they did this.  They think we're decadent  and da-da-da  and whatever. 
[01:23:00]  Our foreign policy  or whatever,  but it's because  they think we're decadent  and greedy.  And this is so true.  Yeah,  it's because,  you know what?  Everybody's sucking it  that this happened.  Yeah.  It's so sick.  That's what it is.  He's a sick bastard.  And you know what?  I hope these statements,  I hope they do him in  so mean.  I can't stand him.  I can't stand him.  You know what it is?  They're expected.  And I'll tell you something else.  You know,  much more eloquently  and poetically maybe, 
[01:23:30]  Billy Graham kind of,  I think,  said the same thing,  that it's our spiritual deficit  that did this.  It's like,  what?  Yeah,  he has to,  you know,  I heard his little sermon  that he gave  at the memorial service  in Washington  and he's up there saying,  don't worry,  those people that died  in this tragedy  are in heaven right now  and it's tragedies like this  that have to remind people  to turn to God  and it's like,  man,  you know, 
[01:24:00]  I ain't buying it  and I don't want it  shoved down my throat  every two seconds.  Oh, I know.  And, you know,  and now,  what about your list of songs?  Can we sing some Riza songs?  I think any Riza Minnelli song  is appropriate.  Probably not her version  of New York, New York.  What do you mean?  Yeah, New York, New York.  It's on the list.  Is it really?  Frank Sinatra's version.  A list of songs  that shouldn't be played  on the radio  during this time of tragedy.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  And you know something?  If you want to look  into your own version  of God  to seek some relief in this, 
[01:24:30]  that's fine, man.  It's absolutely fine  and everybody does  in their own way.  If you want to go to church  and pray to your God,  I have no problem.  You can't finger point  at a time like that.  But to take an interpretation  of something 2,000 years ago  and then try to spread it  on other people,  your version of it,  and say that this is law,  you know,  as far as their religion goes,  is such a pile of crap  and I don't know  how people buy into this.  Well, hopefully, 
[01:25:00]  people will not buy into that.  But there are people  that I know  that there are people  that are doing.  We've got an entire Midwest  that is just teeming  with people doing that.  Well, I, for one,  do not believe  homosexuals are in any way  homosexuals.  You said homosexuals?  Jim Norton.  Homosexuals.  Those homosexuals  give good hum-jubs.  I believe the queer  and the colored.  are fine in our society  and we can get along.  Unbelievable.  Mario,  it was just great 
[01:25:30]  to see you  completely nude  on the street.  And we hope  to see you again.  I love you guys  and I'll be in again soon.  All right.  All right.  We can all use the laugh.  I'll do my best  to do my duty.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Mario.  All right, kiddos.  Bye-bye.  Here's Mario Cantone  in Better Days  singing  You Are Not Alone.  You are not alone.  Second of the words.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message  at the tone.  You are not alone. 
[01:26:00]  Can I call you  on the phone?  Liza,  those aren't the words.  You are not alone.  Liza, stop.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message  at the tone.  Liza, I am alone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  I don't really care.  Fix my pretty hair.  There you have it.  Ron, you're next. 
[01:26:30]  Get your bombs out.  All righty.  Hey, O.N.A.  Hey, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show, Ron.  All righty.  Meaning now, sorry.  Meaning go.  Like talk.  Meaning you're...  You're on the air, Ron.  Ron.  Hey, listen.  I'm so sick of getting  these Nostradamus emails.  The guy was wrong  99.9% of the time.  You know,  everybody's talking  about these two  flaming buildings  in the first of the millennium  on the next month.  Enough already.  Everybody's depressed  as it is.  We don't need to hear  this stuff  or people send it around.  I'm being sent 
[01:27:00]  the same ten emails  over and over again.  It's over.  It's over.  This guy's wrong.  I got the one  from the Miami Herald.  It was very nice.  The editorial.  I got the thing  the guy wrote  from Canada.  It was very good.  Did you get the picture  of the World Trade Center  rebuilt with the  shorter ones next to it  and the even shorter ones  there to make it look  like it's flipping  the bird open?  Yeah, I got that.  Have you gotten that one  eight billion times?  I got the bald eagle crying.  With the American flag  on his face.  I got the picture  of the World Trade Center 
[01:27:30]  where it looks like  Satan's face is in the smoke.  We got them all.  We got the pictures  and the video  of the mystery object  flying past  the World Trade Center.  What the hell is that?  Is that a fly  going in front of  the camera lens?  There's one video clip  of the second plane  hitting the tower  that shows this object,  this shadowy object  flying past and down  past the buildings.  That's the nose cone.  No, because it starts 
[01:28:00]  after the plane hit.  It's on foxnews.com  if you want to look it up.  Yeah, a lot of this stuff  is linked to our  underground website too.  Foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com  Foundrymusic.com  But it is the same thing.  But Rick, we've gotten  all the emails, you're right.  Every single one,  there's nothing new  out there already.  The one with the eagle  and then there's the one  with the large black guy  being fellated  by the little white man.  No, that's other emails  that you've gotten probably.  That sounds like you're  Visit one website. 
[01:28:30]  We got all the bin Laden stuff.  Right.  We have it all.  Have it all.  All right.  Thank you, Ron.  Thank you.  American Pie is on the list.  Bye-bye, Miss American Pie.  Do you want to get into  the whole list?  But the station around here  is playing it a lot.  But they'll play 24 hours  of depressing news stories  but you can't play the music.  It doesn't make sense.  Right.  You know something?  You can't play the music  because it might have something  to do with the tragedy  but you can watch the tragedy  eight billion times.  It's okay to see the plane hitting  but don't listen to a song 
[01:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Because it may be offensive  even though the song  was written years  before this tragedy.  Not offensive  but upsetting.  It's over-  Right.  Drummer Boy.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  I'm in a cover band  and we...  I didn't even read the list  but I know that  like half our set list  is probably on there  and probably a song  like Bodies,  Drowning Pool.  Is that on there?  That song was at the top  of the list,  Drowning Pool Bodies.  That would shake  some people up a little bit.  That's a song about  the mosh pit though. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We played two shows  this weekend.  We played 50 songs a night.  That was probably getting  the best reaction  each night that we played  of all the songs we did.  You know what song...  Because it gives you a release.  Yeah.  Speaking...  Yeah.  Some of these songs  give you a release.  Like Limp Bizkit,  Break Stuff.  Why can't a radio station  play that?  Because everybody  has got their little issues  they have to do.  This is a world thing.  Give people something  to like grab their balls  and scream about. 
[01:30:00]  There's another opinion on it.  I mean there are songs  that...  Like Soundgarden,  Black Hole Sun,  Leonard Skinner's on this list  with Tuesday's Gone.  War Pigs by Sabbath.  War Pigs by Sabbath.  A lot of Sabbath.  War Pigs,  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,  Suicide Solution.  Which was by Ozzy,  not Sabbath who wrote that.  True.  On this list from Metallica,  Seek and Destroy,  Harvester or Sorrow,  Enter Sandman,  Fade to Black, 
[01:30:30]  Nine Inch Nails,  Head Like a Hole.  What else that jumps out  at you here?  Godsmack's the latest  Bad Religion,  which is a really,  really good song.  Amazing.  I did that this weekend too  and people loved it.  Soundgarden,  Blow Up the Outside World  made this list.  ACDC,  there's just about  every ACDC song  ever recorded,  including Shot Down  in Flames,  Shoot to Thrill,  Dirty Deeds,  Highway to Hell,  Safe in New York City,  TNT,  Hell's Bells,  goes on. 
[01:31:00]  Dio,  Holy Diver,  shouldn't be played  on the radio  according to this list.  Steve Miller Baron,  Jet Air Liner.  Is any Wang Chung on there?  Wang Chung did not make  the list.  Oh,  Kajagoogoo,  Van Halen Jump  should not be played  according to this list.  Queen,  Killer Queen  and another one  Bites the Dust.  Pat Benatar,  Hit Me With Your Best Shot  and Love is a Battlefield.  Hulk Hogan's  I'm a Real American,  is that on the list?  You're allowed to play that one.  Oh,  right.  Going down this list here,  Oingo Boingo, 
[01:31:30]  Dead Man's Party,  R.E.M.,  It's the End of the World  as We Know It,  shouldn't be played.  Can they just stop  overprotecting people?  Talking heads,  burning down the house.  I can't believe someone  actually decided  they needed to make a list.  Yeah.  It's common sense  for some of these songs,  you know what I mean?  I would never associate  a song with it.  I know.  It wouldn't in my car.  You listen to the song,  we've heard it.  Judas Priest,  Some Heads Are Gonna Roll.  Now that's a song about,  you know,  getting back at someone.  You're pissed off.  Right.  Why not play that?  Pink Floyd,  Run Like Hell,  Mother. 
[01:32:00]  I mean,  you can interpret  a lot of these titles  to mean things  that are horrible.  Right.  And tragically tied  to this whole thing,  but for the most part,  yeah,  that's the song  about kicking some ass.  Right.  Getting your chicken,  your meat back.  At this point on the radio,  if I can throw that in again.  On the way home,  this is what I want to hear.  I want to hear songs  that mean something like  we are going to kick  some serious ass.  Right.  That's what I need to hear  on the radio right now.  Not these songs  that are going to make me  even sadder than I am right now.  Inspired. 
[01:32:30]  Dave Matthews Band,  Crash Into Me.  Well,  Bangles,  Walk Like an Egyptian.  Now,  explain why you shouldn't play  Walk Like an Egyptian  on the radio.  Do we have  Walk Like an Egyptian?  Maybe we could play  a little of it  and see what's so bad  about Walk Like an Egyptian.  Because it's a  Middle Eastern reference.  I don't know.  I can understand  Killing an A-Rab  by The Cure,  which didn't make the list,  by the way.  Oh,  there you go.  We don't have it.  Cops are in the donut shop. 
[01:33:00]  I mean,  there's nothing offensive  to that at all.  It's just a silly,  dumb song.  Well,  if you guys could explain  why some of these songs  shouldn't be played,  like that one.  Some of them are obvious  according to this list.  Maybe it's just that it sucks.  Maybe they threw it in  because we shouldn't  just be playing that at all.  On principle.  Pretenders,  My City Was Gone.  Alanis Morissette,  why shouldn't you play  ironic on the radio?  Because one of the  irony things that she has  in there is the guy  getting on the plane  for the first time.  Oh,  okay.  Right.  Look at you.  Very good.  I'm a big Alanis fan, 
[01:33:30]  Opie.  I did not know that.  Please.  Let's see.  John Parr,  St. Elmo's Fire.  Peter Gabriel,  When You're Falling.  Was anyone playing that  anyway?  No.  St. Elmo's Fire.  Remember that?  What about  Aha,  Take On Me?  Take on me.  The video was really cool.  What about the Warriors?  Aha,  stinks.  Here's  Walk Like an Egyptian.  All right,  we got it. 
[01:34:00]  Walk Like an Egyptian.  It's playing?  That means it's A,  not B again.  No,  it's B.  It's B?  Yeah.  A,  B,  C,  D,  not A,  B,  D.  It's not working?  We can never get that computer.  We can always get it from here.  All right,  listen,  what we'll do is we'll take a break.  We'll play Walk Like a Egyptian,  try to figure out why that song shouldn't be on the radio,  and we'll go over the second half of the list.  Yeah.  I mean,  there's hundreds of songs.  We also have a little ditty I just want to get to at some point today. 
[01:34:30]  We actually have,  remember that old favorite,  Ahab the A-Rab?  I don't remember that song.  You don't remember Ahab the A-Rab?  It was a video for Ray Stevens.  Ray Stevens,  who was back in the 70s.  Did he sing Ghostbusters?  No,  he didn't.  No,  that was Ray Parker Jr.  Oh,  Ray Parker Jr.  Ray Stevens did.  Who the hell's Ray Stevens?  Remember he did The Streak?  Okay.  Oh,  well,  they call it The Streak.  Funny whistling noise.  Look at that, 
[01:35:00]  look at that.  And then,  what was this,  his follow-up hit?  I guess so.  He also did  the one  Jesus Loves the Little Children of the World.  That was his like serious one.  He was kind of a goof.  I mean,  nobody was claiming  that he was,  you know,  John Lennon,  but just some hillbilly  with a,  you know,  a little tune in his head.  But just the thought  that back then  a hit song,  it was huge.  I mean,  people,  it was a novelty song  that you could have  Ahab the Arab  back then.  But now it's just, 
[01:35:30]  it helps us,  I hate these people more.  And it's not,  come on,  don't look at me like that,  of course,  I'm kidding.  It's not on the list of songs  that you shouldn't play.  No.  We'll get to the rest of the list  in a little bit.  How do you forget Ray Stevens?  I mean,  my God,  if anybody's been in the public eye  more lately.  All right,  we'll be there.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon  without spanking my junk.  Okay,  terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  This is the type of music  I need to hear on the radio now.  A lot of stations  just holding it down,  Anthony.  Holding it down.  Yeah.  They're bringing it down,  you know,  trying to be  all nicey-nice.  We need some  high-energy music.  Music to kick ass to.  We're all sad.  We get it.  We don't need to be sadder.  You know,  music makes you do things.  I mean,  Ozzy Osbourne made people  commit suicide.  Right.  We just can't handle music. 
[01:36:30]  The video's fine.  You can watch the videos all day,  but don't listen to any music.  This, I think,  is inspiring.  It rallies you.  All right, Ant.  If you're just tuning in,  there's a list going around  by one of the big radio companies  telling their radio stations  not to play the following songs,  and it's a really long list of tunes.  Because I guess hearing these songs  would be offensive on the radio,  right?  Yeah, 
[01:37:00]  they're trying to be nice.  You know,  they don't want to upset people  because of some of the titles  and some of the lyrics  of these songs.  Some of them,  yeah,  I could understand.  Other ones,  it's like,  what?  Why?  Yeah,  so we're trying to figure out  why for some of these.  Well,  Kansas,  Dust in the Wind,  that's pretty obvious,  okay?  Yeah.  Led Zeppelin made the list  with Stairway to Heaven.  And why?  Why?  A few Beatles songs  made the list.  A Day in the Life,  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Why Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds? 
[01:37:30]  That's a song about LSD,  isn't it?  William Shatner's version,  too?  William Shatner's.  I hate to think that.  Picture yourself  in a boat  on a river  with dandering trees  and marmalades,  guys,  guys,  guys.  Somebody calls you,  you answer quiet,  slowly,  the girl with colliders  go,  bye,  bye,  bye,  bye,  bye,  Barry wants in here.  Barry,  what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey,  what's up?  You tell me.  Yeah, 
[01:38:00]  I wanted to know  if Bon Jovi's  one of Dead or Alive  was on that list or not.  Of course not.  No?  And Bush said that today.  He wants Bin Laden  dead or alive.  Dead or Alive.  Fantastic.  Who on is?  Dead or Alive.  All right,  Barry,  thank you.  Thank you.  Was that Shatner  that you put in there,  Rick?  I thought it was.  I'd like to have heard  a little bit of that.  Ahab the...  Ahab the Arab?  Yeah,  I can't believe you guys  know that song.  I have no idea.  Oh my God.  Bob Dylan in Guns N' Roses 
[01:38:30]  doing Knocking on Heaven's Door.  That would be in bad taste  according to this list.  Arthur Brown,  Fire.  I am the goddess of hell's.  I am the god of hell's fire  and I bring you  fire.  Yeah.  Bam,  bam,  bam.  Blue Oyster Cult's  burning for you.  That's the only...  Blue Oyster Cult  burning for you?  That's 50% of their playlist  that gets on the radio.  And I don't think  Don't Fear the Reaper  is going to be either.  Going to be on there.  You're not able  to be played either.  No, 
[01:39:00]  you're allowed to play  Don't Fear the Reaper.  It's not on the list.  Maybe this isn't  a complete list.  Maybe they're adding  to this list.  They probably are.  Let's hope.  Who could think  of every song?  Paul McCartney in Wings,  Live and Let Die.  Jimi Hendrix,  Hey Joe.  Why Hey Joe?  Someone help me out  with that one.  Where are you going  with that gun in your hand?  He's going to shoot  his old lady.  What does that have  to do with anything?  That's ridiculous.  Stephen Lynch,  the cabbie song. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  All right.  How about Jackson Brown,  Doctor My Eyes?  I don't know.  Seriously.  Someone who's a little  better at music than us.  Help us.  Why Doctor My Eyes?  We still didn't cover  the bangles.  Why is walk like  an Egyptian?  A lot of people  called and said  just because we're  not sure of some  of the hijackers  were Egyptian.  Doctor My Eyes.  I guess the rule  would be don't play  anything by an artist  with foreskin.  John Mellencamp,  John Mellencamp, 
[01:40:00]  crumbling down  and I'm on fire.  U2, Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Interesting.  That's a stretch.  Boston Smokin',  Billy Joel,  Only the Good Die Young.  Barry McGuire,  Eve of Destruction.  Steam,  nah, nah, nah, nah,  hey, hey, goodbye.  All right.  Really?  New York State of Mind  on there by Billy Joel?  No.  Let's see.  I'm moving down here.  Zombie, She's Not There,  Elton John,  Benny and the Jets,  Danielle,  and Rocket Man.  Thank God.  Three less Elton John 
[01:40:30]  songs we have to listen to.  Jerry Lee Lewis,  Great Balls of Fire,  Santana, Evil Ways.  Is Elton going to  pull out his  candle in the wind?  Norma Jean  candle in the wind  remake.  Why not?  It worked three times  before this.  And write some other  words to it.  He used that  originally for Marilyn Monroe.  Then it was for  the white kid.  Oh,  Ryan White  when that kid  died of the age.  And then he pulled it  out for Lady Di.  For Lady Di.  And now I'm sure 
[01:41:00]  he was in the news.  He said he will not  fly on another  American  airliner company.  That's good.  Because everyone was  wondering how he'd  get around.  Yeah.  Who cares,  sissy boy?  Unless there's an  armed guard on the  plane.  All right.  Where are we,  Elton John?  Sissy.  I just caught that.  Sissy.  When do you hear  that anymore?  Nobody cares how  that...  You sissy.  Do people really  care how a rich  Nancy is flying 
[01:41:30]  around?  Matt,  what's up?  Hey,  this is an old  episode of WKRP  in Cincinnati.  Why?  Don't you remember  that?  There was an episode  where they had a list  of songs they  couldn't play.  Like some holy  rollers to go over  the airwaves or  something.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  Booger.  Remember that?  Now,  Opie,  I think you're  Dr. Johnny  Fever now.  Thank you,  sir.  Is that why  Dr. My Eyes,  because of all 
[01:42:00]  the eyewash  needed by the  medical and  rescue people?  now that's a  stretch.  That is a  stretch.  But hey,  look at some  of the...  We're seeing  the footage on  TV where  they're washing  out everyone's  eyes,  but come on.  Well,  maybe.  Let's see what  else is on this  list.  Did we say  Louis Armstrong,  What a Wonderful World?  Why is that?  I guess because it  hasn't been the last  week and therefore  that irony would  bother people.  Right.  Okay.  What if they had  horrific clips in  between the lyrics? 
[01:42:30]  That would be  acceptable because  you can show the  videos over and  over and people  will watch.  Yeah,  great.  Youngbloods get  together.  Peter,  Paul and Mary  blowing in the  wind and leaving  on a jet plane.  Blowing in the  wind?  How many roads  must a man walk?  I hate that folk  crap.  Rolling Stones,  Ruby Tuesday,  Simon and Garfunkel,  Bridge Over Troubled  Water.  What?  Why is that?  Carole King, 
[01:43:00]  I Feel the Earth  Move,  Anthony.  Jaeger and  Evans,  remember this song  in the year 2525.  If man is still  alive.  If you guys are on  Instant Feedback,  help us out and tell us  why for some of these  songs.  Not the obvious  ones.  Norman Greenbaum,  Spirit in the Sky.  How about I've got a  brand new pair of  roller skates?  Remember that?  Is there anything not  on this list?  These creeps?  It's like Footloose.  Let me go to Chris.  Chris,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  just wondering if the 
[01:43:30]  insect song was on  there.  You better watch out  or the insects  will get you.  Or the muslims  will get you.  You better watch out  or the insects  will get you.  There you go.  You better watch out  or the insects  will get you.  Jim Norton,  do you know what  this is?  Yes.  Oh,  okay.  And you shouldn't  play it because it  might remind people  of the way everyone  in Afghanistan is  acting right now.  Like retards.  That's actually a 
[01:44:00]  bunch of retarded  children that they  got together and  they got a little  song and they  were singing it,  if you could call it.  Debbie,  flight attendant,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  I went to work  today.  And I was scared  to go,  but it's really  not much to worry  about.  What airline  should you say?  I really shouldn't  say.  Okay.  You're telling me  why we have  nothing to worry  about.  I'm not saying  nothing to worry  about,  but...  Are the doors to  the cockpit still  paper thin?  The reason why the 
[01:44:30]  doors to the  cockpits have  always been  paper thin are  because if  there's a fire,  they always want  the pilots to be  able to get out.  But now they  will change that.  But they are  still thin,  yeah.  How about the  pop-out window or  something?  How about the  cockpit door on  the side of the  plane?  You know,  things are getting  crazy.  Newsday today,  there was somebody  writing about some  of the changes they  should do in the  planes, and one of  the suggestions was  to give the pilots  tranquilizer guns.  Wow, that would  be good.  It's good if  gentle Ben is in  there. 
[01:45:00]  You know,  if a little cougar  is roaming the  cabin, you might  have to tag with  a dart gun.  Why don't they  just follow LL,  what they do?  I think they  have, you know,  they're armed and  they have bulletproof  doors.  Multiple doors.  Multiple doors.  Multiple doors.  Imagine that,  though.  You've got to go  through one door,  and then they know  you're up to some  shenanigans or  hijinks, if I might  say, Jim Norton,  and then while  they're trying to  get through the  other door, how  about having some  defense mechanism 
[01:45:30]  there?  You know?  Nice.  I like that.  So, Debbie, you're  feeling safe in the  sky?  Yeah, it was  fine today.  Security's really  good, and I don't  think they're going  to, you know, even  waste their time at  this point.  Really?  Well, why would  you bother?  You don't think a  suicide bomber would  waste his time trying  to do this again in  the near future?  I think there's so  much security right  now that there's, if  the people that are  affiliated with  Bin Laden want to,  I think that they 
[01:46:00]  specifically would be  targeting something  different.  Hey, how come I'm in  my seat, someone next  to me, we order a  couple of vodkas and,  or a couple of rums,  and you give us the  little bottles, and  then you only give us  one can of Coke to  share.  Yet, if somebody's  alone and they ask for  rum and Coke, they get  the little bottle and  they get a whole can of  Coke.  Well, that's not my  airline.  Oh, it isn't?  No.  All right, maybe we  could, you know, up with  the safety things and  everything like that.  Maybe we could work on  that also.  Okay.  Getting hands to 
[01:46:30]  everybody.  Can I ask a question?  You don't have to say  what airline you work  in, but what is a  major hub of your  airline?  Oh, definitely one of  the airports that the  planes flow out of.  So, is also one of  your hubs Houston and  Cleveland?  Yes.  That's my airline.  Nice.  They're the best.  Can you push my status  up from zero to  not zero?  I'd like to go from  gold to platinum.  Are you still going to  travel?  Yeah, of course I will.  Okay. 
[01:47:00]  I hope to see you.  I have to get up to  Buffalo area for a  Jets-Bills game.  No way am I flying.  Hey, Debbie, how full or  empty was the plane?  It was only about a  quarter full.  Quarter full.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, Debbie.  Hang in there, right?  All right.  I'm Debbie.  Fly me.  Yeah.  The sexy stews, I'll  be checking in.  The sexy stews.  Let's go to John.  He knows why we  shouldn't be playing  Doctor of My Eyes. 
[01:47:30]  Why can't I play  Doctor of My Eyes by  Jackson Brown?  John.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to let  you know, the chorus to  that song is, is this the  price for having learned  how not to fly?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that would be the  reason why Doctor of My Eyes  wouldn't quite be apropos  for this moment.  Oh, interesting.  Look at you.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Moving on with the list,  Anthony.  Songs that radio stations  shouldn't play. 
[01:48:00]  Cat Stevens, Peace Train,  and Morning Has Broken.  Peace Train?  Why not Peace Train?  He's a Muslim.  Oh, wow.  Any Cat Stevens.  I couldn't play him  because he is a dirty  Muslim.  Wow.  Opie, I think you're  lumping a lot of people  into that category.  We just threw a billion  people into a room.  I know.  Really?  There are some very  law-abiding Muslim people  in this city and around  the country.  Great. 
[01:48:30]  You sit next to him  on the train.  Better.  Let's make believe we're  now a little paranoid  right now.  I love it.  God.  Wow.  Okay.  Hey, I guess we're  going to have to work  on that as a people.  Jan and Dean, Dead  Man's Curve.  It's about a car.  Oh, stop it, Rick.  Martha and the Vandellas  and Van Halens dancing  in the streets.  Why?  Because of that stupid  clip probably of the  Palestinians supposedly  celebrating. 
[01:49:00]  See, my guess is a guess.  I don't think that much  when I'm listening to the  radio.  Me neither.  Hollies, he ain't heavy,  he's my brother.  I heard a bunch of  stations playing that  over the weekend.  I can't imagine why  that would be there.  Don McLean, American Pie.  Buddy Holly and the  Crickets, that'll be the  day.  Probably any Buddy Holly  song would be bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Considering how he went.  There you go.  There it is.  John Lennon, Imagine  should not be played  on the radio.  Bobby Darin, Mac the  Knife.  They'll use knives. 
[01:49:30]  Because they use  knives.  Holy S.  Come on.  You suck.  But.  You're kidding, right?  I'm guessing that's the  stupid rationale behind it.  The Clash, Rock the  Casbah.  The Safaris, Wipeout.  Blood, Sweat and  Tears and When I Die,  which is a great song.  Tramps, Disco Inferno.  Wow.  Paper Lace, remember  that song, The Night  Chicago Die?  Awful.  Frank Sinatra, like 
[01:50:00]  you said.  How about Afternoon  Delight?  Did that make the list?  Afternoon Delight.  Afternoon Delight?  No.  Throwing sticks and  stones together, make a  spark ignite, Opie.  One of the lyrics of  Afternoon Delight.  As long as the theme  from Alice didn't make it.  That's a song that has to  be played.  There's a new girl in town  and she's looking good.  A fresh new face in the  neighborhood.  There's a new girl in...  Shoot her.  Wouldn't you like to just  drill your fist into  Linda Lavin's teeth?  Linda Lavin decided she was 
[01:50:30]  going to sing the theme  song to Alice.  No, I'm like,  early to ride, early to  bed.  Just a dream that went  out of my head.  Shut up, hooah.  Although Vic Tayback was  a genius.  Wow.  I can't stand that,  Linda Lavin.  Nice.  And she's like,  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah.  They bring it on down  just before the show.  Bring it on down, Alice.  What is that? 
[01:51:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Do you have the song?  Yeah, I'll take care of  you.  Let me hear it.  Early to ride.  Yes.  You're a scientist.  Early to bed.  And in between, I cooked  and cleaned it out of my head.  Going through the night  with blinders on, it's tough  to see.  I'm playing my pants blue.  I had to get up, get up  from under and before me.  There's a new 
[01:51:30]  burning town  and she's looking  there's a fresh  freckled face  in the honey  with a new  in town  with a brand new  in town.  She was just  passing through  but when things  work out  she's gonna stay.  My favorite part.  Bring it down, Linda.  Bring it down. 
[01:52:00]  That's awful.  Tim, you're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, God.  And my whole attitude  toward you has changed  since you know the lyrics  to Afternoon Delight  but we'll move on.  Two things.  One, I think  Doctor My Eyes  at the very end  it makes reference  to smoke  of a distant fire.  Oh, brother.  I mean, they're stretching it  but also  on a serious  I mean, I don't want  to make a joke  but did Steve Miller  Jet Ailiner make this?  Yes.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  I got in late  so I just wanted to  I figured that's gotta be  one that's off.  Yeah.  But Ant, you're a fag.  Guys, keep up the good work.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's move on here, Anthony.  More songs that  radio stations shouldn't be playing  according to this list here.  Where were we?  Frank Sinatra  CCR Traveling Band  The Gap Band  You dropped a bomb on me  Well, yeah.  Why can't the Traveling Band song  I don't know  Someone's gotta help us  with some of these songs  I don't get it. 
[01:53:00]  Playing in a Traveling Band?  I don't know.  Alien and Farm  Smooth Criminal  Did we figure out why  for that one yet?  Just because of the  Criminal  The Door's the End  Third Eye Blind  Jumper  Neil Diamond  America  They come into America  I think that's because  it might offend people  because it's about  you know  everybody  come on in  come on in  give us your huddled  masses of crap  come on in

[02:01:00]  yeah  you find him  though  you find him  lots of  massive feedback  coming in  we just read  the list  some radio  a list of songs  you shouldn't  be playing  on the radio  these days  that list is up  on foundrymusic.com  f-o-u-n-d-r-y  music.com  a lot of songs  left off that list  yeah  you can just imagine  we don't really  feel like going  down that road  you can just  play along at home  if you're that  sick and twisted  today  Mike from Philly  we couldn't figure out 
[02:01:30]  why Everclear  Santa Monica  was on the list  the chorus goes  we can live  beside the ocean  leave the fire  behind  swim out past  the breakers  and watch the  world die  oh there you go  okay that makes  a little more sense  Pat from Jersey  writes in  can't someone  stop those  S for brains  PDs who think  they're changing  the world  by tweaking  bull-ass pop tunes  with disaster reports  hallelujah Pat  thank you  every disaster  we gotta look  forward to  but every day  there's a new one  I know  and they all think 
[02:02:00]  they're better  than the last  they all suck  don't they realize  that the event  itself yanks  a tear out of you  they don't have  to put a dumb  song to it  it's sad  we know  it's horrible  and who's doing  this  who's sitting  in a little  studio  there's only  one reason  to put a song  like that  on the radio  with the clips  not so we never  forget or anything  it's to make  the listeners  sadder  they love  doing this stuff  the news people  do they have  to walk up  to people  that are looking  for loved ones  with the picture 
[02:02:30]  in their hand  and tell them  could you tell me  a little bit  about the person  that's missing  tell me what you  miss the most  about them  they are saying  could you cry  in front of my camera  because my boss  is watching  and I need a story  could you please  just lose your  effing mind  in front of my camera  so I could  maybe get some  kind of an award  and my boss  will love me  for getting this  tragedy on tape  that's what they're  saying  did you see  the black family  in DC  I think the father  works in the pentagon 
[02:03:00]  and they interviewed  them and it was  really sad  and the little girl  started crying  and the camera  zooms in  just to capture  every moment  of her discomfort  vultures  every moment  of her horror  yeah she's like  seven or eight  and they just  couldn't get enough  of her being upset  of course  what do you guys  think of Dick Cheney  on TV yesterday  that was kind of  nice  with Tim Russell  they wheeled him  out  it's good to see  that he is alive  they were  yeah  they were talking  to him about 
[02:03:30]  that presidential  executive order  that was put in  place by President  Ford  that says  the United States  government  will never  assassinate people  things of that type  that's the reason  we didn't go after  Saddam Hussein  directly  we just  bombed the hell  out of his country  it comes down  to this executive  order  and they asked  Dick Cheney  if you have  the opportunity  if the United States  government  has the opportunity  to assassinate  Osama Bin Laden  will it be taken  and Dick Cheney  kind of thought  about it  then he goes 
[02:04:00]  I'll have to  check with the  lawyers about it  but I would  have no problem  with that  you're going to  see that whole  executive order  just be wiped  off of the books  really quick  well he was  describing how  they got him  out of the  White House  because I guess  it was a little  touch and go  there for a while  they knew the  plane was coming  toward the White House  and Dick Cheney  was in the White House  and also in the  Secret Service  comes busting in  he explains this  on TV last night  and they don't  ask you questions  nothing  they just said  Dick Cheney  you're coming  with us 
[02:04:30]  and he goes  they raced him  down the hall  and down a staircase  into this hidden  zone beneath the  White House  thanks for telling  everyone that you  got a place  underneath the  White House  by the way  you idiots  Das Bunker  Das Bunker  but he's explaining  what the Secret  Service  how they got him  out of the  White House  and this is what  made me feel  really good  and comfortable  they said  Dick goes  my feet  barely touched  the ground  and I'm like  thank God 
[02:05:00]  they physically  carried him  right  thank God  they didn't  make that  little heart  of his pump  any harder  than it is  right now  Imagine they're  forcing him  to run down  the hallways  of the  White House  oh my  God  but they  carry him  his feet  touched like  twice  he said  they should  just have  the Dick  Cheney  hand truck  that they  could just  load him  on  like Hannibal Lecter  was brought  in with the  hand truck  have the  Dick Cheney  emergency  hand truck  that they  could just 
[02:05:30]  wheel him  from place  to place  in the  White House  we're going  to need  that guy  I know  don't even  walk down  to the  vending machine  to get a  Snickers bar  let someone  else go  don't move  can I raise  the point  that I really  don't think  that he gave  anything away  by saying  there's a bunker  beneath the  White House  I think most  people assumed  but the thing  is again  like we  assumed  there was  some kind  of a  missile system  in place  that no  plane  could crash  into the  Pentagon  but there  is  let's stop  assuming  let's just  shut our  mouths  I have a  funny thing  about what  happens  when you 
[02:06:00]  assume  I'm assuming  right now  that the  basement of the  White House  is a half  finished  paneled  party room  with a pool  table  and a  ping pong  table  I don't  know about  this  bunker  we must  get you  into  this  bunker  Keith from  Bayonne  Jersey  I just saw  on Fox 5  that Michael  Jackson is  going to  write a  song for  the victims  called  what more  can I  do  no way  it's 
[02:06:30]  official now  I want  off this  planet  that was the  final straw  get me on  a shuttle  I'm done  with this  planet  why  the pictures  of him  and Liz  Taylor  are sweet  her with  that big  friggin  Mardi Gras  float head  and him  with that  I don't  even know  what it  is  you can't  even describe  Michael  Jackson  anymore  remember  you used  to be able  to describe  him in  certain  bizarre  fashion  you look  at him  now  and just  go  you figure 
[02:07:00]  it out  I have  no clue  here's the  skin tone  of stinky  little pale  he's whiter  than limey's  and incidentally  can I mention  really not that  this ties into  the show  but that  Garrett is  outside  in a pair  of shorts  and he's  got quite  masculine legs  and I'm  not homosexual  is that it  he's been  traipsing around  all day  in those  Garrett  he's checking  out your legs  give his hair  a little  tussle  he's checking  out your  games  I don't even 
[02:07:30]  want to go  into this  whole area  look at  this  Jackson  to record  benefits  song  they have  a picture  of him  on the  CNN  website  the  entertainment  section  where  he's  next to  that  bizarre  creature  Liz Taylor  he's wearing  a glittery  a silver  looks to be  silver  lame  jacket  with gold 
[02:08:00]  lame  sergeant  stripes  on  it  looks  like  he's  from  the  army  of  the  country  faggot  he's a  sergeant  in the  army  from the  country  of  faggot  is that  a statement  why do our  entertainers  in America  insist on  getting gayer  as they get  older  that's true  all the  time  with these  people  Liz  wearing  a big  feather  boa  and  something  even more  preposterous  on her  head  and now 
[02:08:30]  they're saying  the king of  pop  putting together  an ensemble  recording  in an effort  to help  the families  and survivors  of the  terrorist  attacks  I would  like to  believe  that's  what it's  for  I think  it's more  self-serving  that his  concert  sucked  and his  album  isn't  selling  that's  to resurrect  his  career  why does  Liz  Taylor  why does  she  always  have to  be there  can she  just  realize  it's  over  that  stupid  Shelly  Winters  looking  spectacle  nobody  thinks  she's  beautiful  anymore 
[02:09:00]  she is  one of  the most  she is  constantly  voted  one of  the most  beautiful  people  in the  country  she had  her time  yes she  was very  hot  in the  you know  what was  that  national  velvet  when she  was on  the horse  there  but now  I don't  know  and let's  see  the song  what more  can I  give  features  artists  including  Destiny's  Child  Nick  Carter  from  Backstreet Boys  no not  from our  own  WBCN  it's from  the Backstreet Boys  Justin Timberlake 
[02:09:30]  of NSYNC  Britney Spears  and Maya  what more  can I give  how about  heterosexual  performers  would you  find one  of them  for the  song  and of  course  they look  back  Jackson  hopes to  raise more  than $50  million  with the  song  well if  he does  the end  justifies  the means  I guess  all proceeds  will donate  the relief  effort  in 85  they mentioned  Jackson  Lionel Richie  and Harry  Belfonti  and Quincy  Jones  led a group  of music  superstars  in creating  the record  We Are 
[02:10:00]  The World  which benefited  the Ethiopian  famine relief  which yeah  raised a lot  of money  a lot  of artists  so we'll  see what  the king  of pop  can do  here  and he  was at  the height  of his  career  when that  happened  and like  you said  they raised  a lot  of money  and there's  still not  an Ethiopian  over 30  pounds  right  still  hey  it's  David  Marvin  Jay  you're next  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show  hey  you guys  how you  doing  check this  out  I went  to the  East  Center  last night 
[02:10:30]  down by  Camden  to see  John  Cougar  he played  when the  walls  come  tumbling  down  there's  no way  he played  that last  night  I swear  to god  it was  the most  bizarre  thing  I mean  the freaking  guy could have  checked his  set list  and said  I'm going to  scratch this  one  but what was  more bizarre  was that  when he was  playing it  I was looking  around at  everybody  and they  were all  cheering  and they  didn't  realize  and all  of a sudden  this fireman  who was  collecting  donations  outside  walked  through the  crowd  in an  open  aisle  with 
[02:11:00]  and wearing  his helmet  and like  a t-shirt  he wasn't  part of  the show  he was  just like  cruising  by  and I  looked at  my wife  and I'm  like  we gotta  get out  of here  man  this is  so wrong  so we  like bailed  be careful  who you  give your  money to  man  there's  a lot  of dirtbags  out there  right now  it wasn't  like we were  giving this  fire guy  any money  but it was  just a point  that  I'm not  saying  that  the fire  guy  you know  it just  reminded me  that  just be  careful  I'm sure  I'm sure 
[02:11:30]  I tell you  the last  thing I wanted  to do  last night  was go  to see  a show  and you  figure  maybe  he goes  to this  guy  cougar  he's like  an american  dude  whatever  he made  no reference  to the tragedy  he made  no patriotic  this that  the other  thing  not like  that guy  is my hero  and he's  got to  direct me  spiritually  or anything  but it was  a total letdown  like all the  performers were  programmed  just like  well I mean  what did you  want him to say  I mean  the sadness  is in all  of us  maybe he figured  this will be  an escape 
[02:12:00]  for everyone  to get away  from the  constant news  coverage  for an hour  and a half  you're totally  right  I wasn't  expecting  anything  from him  you know  what I mean  I'm pissed  that they  cancelled  the football  games  this weekend  I thought  it was  the thing  to do  just to  give people  a distraction  from the  coverage  not because  we all  want to  go rah  rah  rah  let's go  team  but just  we needed  something  on the TV  this weekend  there was  nothing  I hear you  I hear you  I can't  watch anymore  I'll read  about it  but I can't  watch  who are you  kidding  I mean 
[02:12:30]  people laugh  today a little  bit  and lighten  the load  just a little  bit  as soon as  I get home  I'm turning  on the TV  and checking  out everything  even though  there's nothing  new  I tell you  it was wild  because I was  stranded in Denver  I was grounded  for two days  so I had to fly  I had to take  two flights  on Saturday  and it was  it was really  really bizarre  and I cruised  into Newark  like late  Saturday  how does that  feel  to be in the air  it was  it was pretty  funky man  the planes  were like  only like  a third full  but the  students were  actually really  cool  man  they were doubling  up on your  four dollar beers 
[02:13:00]  and the whole  stuff like that  but you could tell  that these people  didn't want to be there  it was very  very difficult  I can't even  imagine how I'm  going to feel  the first time  I'm in the air  it was tough  and actually  coming in Newark  you know  we had a buzz  we came south  we came north  to south  over to Meadowlands  we kind of  caught a buzz  of the smoke  even though  the sun had set  but it was like  really  I mean  words can't  you know  I can't put it  into words  and John Koger  should have mentioned it  he should have said  he didn't have to 
[02:13:30]  grovel for 40 minutes  but he should have  acknowledged it  that stupid  no hit since 88  bum  and he shouldn't  have played that tune  wall come tumbling down  thank you  alright dude  see you later  bye  but it's a little  ditty  yeah a little  ditty  trying to capture  Americana  can someone  explain to me  why we want to  play Ahab  the A-Rab  how did this  come about  it's a classic  it's you know  we will probably  in very short time  be at war  with some A-Rabs  they were A-Rabs 
[02:14:00]  that did this  but how did this  come up in the  back office  Norton mentioned  it  it's an old  novelty song  from the 70's  and  I remember  just from my youth  it's so politically  incorrect  is what it is  I mean  it's the description  of a stereotypical  A-Rab  that before Tuesday  you couldn't just  play this  I'm sure  you still can't  play it  like it wouldn't  be you know  your local  oldies station 
[02:14:30]  going hey  now it's  Ahab the A-Rab  on your  oldies station  you know  you're not  going to hear it  it's politically  incorrect  it's been  shoved aside  in the world  of political  correctness  I never heard  this song  we were listening  in queue  for a little bit  it sounds like  Alice's Restaurant  well I think  it was the  style  with some of  the parody  songs back then  alright you want to  check it out  let's hear a little  bit of Ahab  the A-Rab  ah see 
[02:15:00]  some Arabian  sounds  nice  it just makes me  want to hear  bombs exploding  let me tell you  about Ahab  the A-Rab  the chic of  the burning  sand  yeah  him was in  rubies  just a dripping  off of him  and a ring  on every finger  of his hand  he wore a big  old turban  wrapped around  his head  and a scimitar  by his side  yeah  and every evening  about midnight 
[02:15:30]  he'd jump on  his camel  named Clyde  and rise  he's on the camel  and the 8x10  glossy photographs  cause like him  and her  had a thing  going  you know  they've been  carrying on  for some time  now  behind the  shoulders  back  and you could  hear him  talk to his  camel  as he rode  out across  the dunes  his voice  would cut  through the  still  and he'd sing  which is 
[02:16:00]  there  next  foot  whoa  baby  and Clyde  say  well  he brought  his camel  to a  screeching  hall  in the  rear  of the  team  of  tent  jumped off  Clyde  looked around  the corner  and into  the tent  and he  went  there he  saw Fatima  laying on  a zebra  skin rug 
[02:16:30]  with rings  on her  fingers  and bells  on her  toes  and a  bone  in her  nose  whole thing  there she  was  friends and  neighbors  laying in  all her  radiant  beauty  eating on  a raisin  and a grape  and an  apricot  and a  pomegranate  a bowl  of  shittling  two  bananas  three  hershey bars  and sipping  on an  ROC  cocoa  listening to  her  transistor  watching  the  grand  old  lottery  and reading  mad magazine  watch this  song  does your  chewing gum  lose its  flavor  and they  have  walk  a  turn  he  say 
[02:17:00]  it's  topical  which is  our mix  up  let's twist  again  like we did  last summer  baby  as you say  the drugs  were so good  back then  crazy baby  crazy baby  that's horrible  yeah  all of a sudden 
[02:17:30]  the sultan  walked in  uh oh  he had knew  that this was  the end  him and  Fatima  was caught  by surprise  and the sultan  had fire  flashing out  of his eyes  well a sultan  charged  should we play  tragedy  news clips  over this  would this be  a good song  but he fled  with Fatima  and out of the tent  they went  they jumped on  Clyde  and started to rise  cutting out across the sand  with the sultan's whole army  in hot pursuit  on and on 
[02:18:00]  they ran  well to make a long story short  too late  they got away  cause they want no animal  alive  what could keep up with Clyde  once he got started  cause he would've  swiped his feet  on the old desert  baby  he's like rapping  and he made it  across the bar  this is a rap tune  and he hopped all his rubies  and emeralds  and the bottom  was swangy little  split level pad  and lived happy  ever after  yeah  and that's the story  about Ahab  the A-Rab  the Sheikah  the burning sand  excuse me 
[02:18:30]  but I do believe  that Chuck X  no S  that's horrible  that was on the radio  oh that was like  a big novelty hit  I really don't remember  that at all  Steven stinks  that was a big novelty hit  oh he stinks  man  Ahab the A-Rab  don't you love the voice  he talked in that  ahab  Ahab  the A-  Ahab  the A-Rab  hello again  hello  just called  to let you know  it's good 
[02:19:00]  to A-Rab  the Ahab  Reb  it sounded like  Arlo Guthrie  Alice's Restaurant  you can get  anything you want  at Alice's Restaurant  Alice  don't bring me flowers  Chris what's going on  hey what's up man  hey  how you guys doing  we're trying to chuckle  a little bit today  Andy are you okay  thanks a lot for last week  that's the first thing  you guys were awesome  oh cool  I just want to let you know man  I just heard that  Michael Jackson  went down and visited  ground zero 
[02:19:30]  yeah  but he got all pissed off  and left because  all the paramedics  kept trying to revive him  oh  Jesus  oh  oh Chris  hey thanks a lot  somebody wrote in  that said  Michael Jackson  looks like  he cut his nose off  and put a white  doorstop in his  little wedge doorstop  it really does look like  he's disgraceful  yes  you've been hit by  a smooth criminal  in America  by the way 
[02:20:00]  really fast  a lot of people  trying to explain  why they cancel  the football games  I understand  I understand why  I understand  people were involved  on these teams  and stuff  and it was tough  to get them around  the country  I understand all that  I was just trying to say  it would have been nice  to have some type  of distraction  this weekend  okay  of course  chuckling from that  Arab song  where's Steve  they want it on  foundrymusic.com  for some reason  oh my god  the author of that song 
[02:20:30]  quite the pistol  yeah  quite a pistol  a lot of moxie  he was hip for his day  that's Ray  a goddamn Madonna  with her  sold out show  on Friday  Staples Center  in LA  urging  the president  to show some restraint  show restraint  tonight I'd like to say  a prayer for peace  she told the crowd  of 18,000 people  violence begets violence  and I don't know  about you  but I want to live  a long and happy life 
[02:21:00]  and I want my kids  to live a long and happy life  so do the people  on the top of the buildings  you twat  hey Madonna  don't you realize  that if we just  don't do anything  that this will happen  again and again  and you know  there's no guarantees  we could do all we can  and it might still  just keep happening  again and again  the thing that people  like this don't understand  is we've talked  we've talked about this  for years  the diplomacy  doesn't work  the being nice guys  don't work  we're the nice guy  of the world  the US  we're the good guys 
[02:21:30]  and we keep getting F'd  and the only thing  that's left to do  is a show of force  so strong  that it will  keep other people  on their toes  and make them think  hey maybe I shouldn't  support this kind of  thinking  and let these people  stay in our country  Madonna doesn't get that though  there may be a deal  Bush could make  with it though  just that  he will show restraint  if she can keep  her mouth and her legs  closed simultaneously  impossible  don't these 
[02:22:00]  don't these  liberal a-holes  realize how horrific  this was  do they realize  that some of these  people had a decision  to make  and that decision  was  should I stay  in my office  building  and burn to death  with a fire  that's over  over 2,000 degrees  or should I jump  to my death  from the 104th  floor  that's a decision  people were making  yep  yep Madonna  the people that were  lucky to make  that decision  you know 
[02:22:30]  some of them  were just blown out  or pushed out  out of sheer panic  who's the one woman  that voted  there was like  452 to 1  that one  dummy in California  voted against  supporting Bush  well they put her  they put her name  and picture  and website  up on Drudge  so I'm sure  she got some  great great emails  just trying to be different  just trying to just  act like she's something  and taking a stand  I'm a leader  creep  like a virgin  touched for the very  first time 
[02:23:00]  like a virgin  feel your heartbeat  listen to your heartbeat  turn on your heart light  make it shine  wherever you go  someone wants to hear  Stephen Lynch's  cabbie song today  we can do that  as we go to break  Stephen Lynch  I flagged him down 
[02:23:30]  at the corner  and he picked me up  at the light  I told him where I was going  and we drove off into the night  see  yeah 
[02:24:00]  alright  how you doing  my friend  I asked him  slowly  he turned  his head  the taxi driver  looked at me  and  this is  what he  said  finger on the button  I'm ready  he said  don't you want me  to drop your army  go  I take it  that nature  take it  that thing  that the  left  the  left  the  right  take it 
[02:24:30]  see that  that's funny  that is funny  that may have been  more offensive  than anything  we've done  exactly  yeah but you know what  that's the kind of  offensiveness  that's allowed  on the station  which is the  the paradox  I applaud  we're still stupid  well if that's what it takes  to get good ratings  we'll continue being stupid  we don't care  we don't care  I've been expecting you  to make exactly that  asinine steak  the Opie and Anthony show

[02:35:00]  got kicked  out of  Boston  you know  our old  station  thought they  could just  go on  his business  as usual  and they  moved this  guy Rocco  down and  and he's  a complete  disgrace to  what we did  in Boston  radio  and now  he's his  little bit  of the day  like I  mean it  is it's  a great  thing that  we're feeling  in here today  to kind of  start joking  around a bit  but to  still keep  the respect  that the  victims are  due and 
[02:35:30]  and the  respect for  the crews  that are  working down  there on a  daily basis  in conditions  no one  could ever  imagine  and there's  no joking  about stuff  like that  we're having  a lot of  laughs in  here about  peripheral  things that  are going  on like  the news  coverage  and stuff  like that  but any  joking  or making  light of  the situation  itself  is a  goddamn  disgrace  and to  hear that  a schlocko  is on the  air saying  that the  biggest tragedy  is that  the drug 
[02:36:00]  trade  and the  drugs  won't be  able to  get into  the states  is an  abomination  and a  disgrace  for people  like Billy  who we got  on the phone  right now  that has  been down  there and  has been  working in  these conditions  i'm not  trying to  bum the  show out  like i said  i just  turned it  on  literally  i'm in  the car  just getting  back  but  unbelievable  i mean  if anybody  in hope  i think  ben might have  told you  i called  yesterday  or whatever
