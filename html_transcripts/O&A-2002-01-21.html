<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a discussion of a local plane crash, speculating on the cause with humorous and morbid conjecture. Anthony’s atheism is briefly noted.  A listener’s plane crash nightmare sparks a tangential, extended discussion about *Back to the Future*.  Commercial breaks feature New York Sports Clubs and Hotwire.

Following the break, the hosts recount and perform offensive jokes told by Muhammad Ali at a recent movie premiere, targeting various ethnic and religious groups.  An attempted interview with “Mr. DVD” is plagued by technical difficulties, resulting in much frustration and expletives.

The show continues with commercials for Stacker 2, listener calls criticizing the show’s lack of structure, and updates on Britney Spears, the new New York City mayor, and a “psychic trivia” suggestion. More listener calls follow, requesting music, jokes, and local information like school closings and weather.  A call about a segment called "Oodles" and a brief, inconclusive discussion about show formats conclude this portion.

A subsequent segment features the recurring “Professor Joke Guy” telling a joke, followed by listener calls.  Callers participate in a “car phone check-in,” a joke-telling contest, a “high-low jackpot” game, and a request for a “420 bong hit.” A “dashboard DJ” announces songs. Several callers tell jokes, some racially offensive; one joke about Black people’s noses is deemed too offensive to continue.  Buddy Epson, a singer, is interviewed and performs songs from his new CD, including a racy song and his "Well Doggy" routine.  The segment concludes with a lengthy, crudely humorous speculation about Al Gore’s post-presidential life, imagining him working at a low-cost family restaurant. Jim Brewer and Jim Norton are present in studio.

The next excerpt begins with a brief discussion of the hosts’ personal preferences, followed by a New York Sports Clubs commercial. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine then perform a sexually suggestive cover of a Nine Inch Nails song. A comedic, highly offensive bit follows, mocking Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, and Peter Jennings, employing militaristic language and racial slurs.

Jackie Fine calls to promote her book, videos, and a sex cream, leading to explicit discussion of its effects.  The hosts and Jackie Fine engage in extended sexually charged banter.  Her websites, JustAssJackie.com and JackieFine.com, are mentioned repeatedly.  Rich Voss, a comedian, joins the studio with Patrice O’Neal also present.  Voss and Opie engage in a back-and-forth filled with insults and jokes. A caller seeks advice on a relationship problem involving menstruation and lack of intimacy; the hosts give crude advice. A comedic, imagined “Cribs” segment featuring Opie’s apartment concludes this section.

A final segment features highly informal and vulgar conversation where a host describes his living space, mentioning unusual items and a shared bathroom with a "rummy" and a "priestitute".  The conversation becomes rambling and nonsensical, using racial slurs, and concludes with the repetitive phrase "Cribs with Stalker Patty." No guest is present in studio during this final excerpt.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  and welcome to the opian anthony show hey in the new york area 877-692-1027 your disaster show  holy ass anywhere else outside of new york 866-277-4 wow we're a beaten city well the latest plane crash um 
[00:00:30]  a hundred yards to our north actually so it was so close when it happened jesus christ we're a beaten  city i can't even uh believe uh when i woke up first of all i'll tell you i i stayed in town thank  god because i never would have gotten in from brooklyn no way no show today i had it turned  around and hid in in my bedroom so i have the alarm set uh for like 10.04 i guess it was set for and uh 
[00:01:00]  it goes off it's one of those uh you know clock alarm clock radio things so it's it's on one of  the stations and i hear the traffic guy uh doing a traffic report at 10.04 now in new york you know  you get it on the eights and the ones depending on what station so alarm goes off and you hear  traffic guy on the fours and you look at and it's 10.04 and he says he goes and word now coming in  and then my girlfriend leaves over and turns the radio off well that's all you heard i'm like but  i'm thinking i'm like there's something strange going on here and i'm hearing outside so then uh 
[00:01:30]  i go all right i i remember the phone ringing so someone left me a message on my cell phone  so i go to check my messages on the cell phone all circuits are busy i'm like uh-oh oh boy last  time this happened uh it was a couple of months ago so i go give me the remote and i i winced i  actually winced pointed it to the tv and hit on to see what it was all about and i just see a fire and 
[00:02:00]  american airlines plane the text on the bottom ah this is great this is good you can't imagine  you can't even fathom it would be a coincidence and just be a standard uh run-of-the-mill plane crash  after what's happened i think it's a coincidence my friend that signs are pointing that way but i  don't know i'm still holding judgment because you know something there's plenty airports there's plenty  of planes and there's plenty other cities that could have a goddamn plane crash but why the hell does 
[00:02:30]  that have to be new york by the way i have to announce our favorite syndicated city yeah that  would be boston massachusetts why is that because they were the only station that called to make  sure you and i and the rest of the gang on the opie anthony show is okay oh i'm sure boston i'm still  trying to figure out how boston was responsible for this one what happened there there's got to be  some boston connection the only city that called to make sure you and i were okay that's true no one 
[00:03:00]  else really cared we didn't get that call from uh san francisco did we no or portland we didn't get a  portland call no one called us from bigfoot country no so but i was talking i was talking to oedipus and  uh i go we're kind of relieved down here because it's looking like it was mechanical failure relieved  we live in a in in an age where we're now relieved when we find out a complete disaster is uh mechanical 
[00:03:30]  failure most likely instead of a terrorist attack well you know something nothing's been ruled out  yet and i'm still uh uh kind of leaning toward uh i think it was mechanical but not ruling anything  out this time opie until my investigation proceeds they uh said they found the black box so they'll be  looking at that and here's my theory bomb in the goddamn cargo bay i don't say that they never but  the thing is that's been a huge issue right now they uh ask you did you pack your own bags yeah  have they been with you yeah all right we'll check them here put the tagger on it and and there it goes 
[00:04:00]  don't say that and then they never check if you're on the plane and your bags are on the plane they don't  even do that there's no way they could check so i'm thinking uh cargo door gets uh blown off where  does that go right into the old engine boom i don't know i'm saying mechanical uh failure and uh  caused by flock of seagulls you think it was the band should they be held responsible for this 
[00:04:30]  and i ran it was a flock of seagulls my friend they say they have problems at kennedy with the birds  yeah lots and lots of birds around kennedy airport they get sucked into the uh the engine there  well you know something i think that the pilots are trained for stuff like that  that's just a ridiculous regular uh engine failure you know what i mean it doesn't blow the engine off 
[00:05:00]  you're a wing for the most part i don't know and then when you're taking off you can't lose an  engine like that let me tell you it went straight down so it didn't even do it as much damage as it  could have let me tell you something man i i think just about every person that listens to the show  has flown out of kennedy airport yeah the plane was only in the air for three minutes we've all seen  that stretch of land where it hit oh yeah that little peninsula when you're coming in rockaways  right sure and and believe me for the first uh two minutes 50 seconds everything was fine 
[00:05:30]  that was a very short trip down and why you know enough already did you see all here's another thing  no god wake up people there's no god  how many new yorkers have you seen on the news and everywhere else huddled together in mass prayer  for our fair city how many times do you see this how many clergymen have you seen at ground zero and 
[00:06:00]  at schools and with politicians talking about prayer and how we're stronger than ever and god will but  all that prayer what did it get us another aircraft full of fuel dropped on a town there's no god  there's no god i'm just a man just a man like you  caddyshack references always nice you hear the uh f-15s yeah that's something boy them things  screaming f-15 just circling over manhattan again what the hell happened what did i miss 
[00:06:30]  you know we got the front row seats to armageddon you could live through life you could sit back  and live through life during a very boring period of time on this planet i'm sure hundreds of years  have gone by in certain places on this globe where nothing happened you're gonna live this is a good  time to live welcome to the end of the world we're all here to see it we're all and this show is here  to get you through it we'll get you through we're your armageddon show you could have lived in the

[00:18:00]  joke that ali said to a crowded room this guy you know let's do it as ali because i won't be able to  well the fun the funniest part is he can get away with anything he's so pathetic now they they have  the the premiere for his big movie there ali with uh who's playing uh will smith will smith and there's  muhammad ali walking into the movie there and they're all like uh ali ali uh paparazzi uh give us a pose  i saw a guy uh turn around and start laughing his ass up like he looked at ali and then had to turn 
[00:18:30]  around because he was laughing because at least try try to make it look like a boxer so hold it hold  their hands up in the ass i can eat oh i'll get you coast here i float like a like a high beam  i sting like a cotton ball and he's got his arms he can't even hold him steady it's a this guy this  little munchkin guy walking him around it's sad because the guy used to be i'll go oh i'll go get 
[00:19:00]  your dope ratio i'll get your dope and now joe who you know his brain is still there though oh is it  yeah he just can't communicate what he's thinking i still believe it's from the decon fog on pesticide  so he's in a crowded uh crowded room in washington and he decides to tell a couple jokes here's uh his  first joke this is the god's honest truth go ahead as ali what's what's the difference between a jew and a 
[00:19:30]  canoe a canoe a canoe tips  one of the probably one of the the more classic of the anti-semitical jokes so he says this in a  crowded room the crowd which included a number of jewish people including ali actor ron silver  laughed nervously nervously but ali wasn't through here was his next joke 
[00:20:00]  a black a paul rican and a mexican in a car who who's driving the police  and it says blacks and hispanics in the crowd also paid ali the courtesy of laughing courtesy  the washington post lloyd grove who was at the party reports that ali's fourth wife lani tried to  head off his routine as he took the mic pleading no no no don't no ali's rep admitted his humor was 
[00:20:30]  politically incorrect but argued these are not new jokes oh muhammad time i understand the struggle  muhammad old jokes tells them all the time because he likes to make people laugh i know ali and he  shocks people to make uh a point he always manages to diffuse any situation that seems overly reverential  reverential r okay following the film everybody was paying tribute to him and he was in a good mood  by the way the premiere was a fundraiser for blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you want to buy a dryer 
[00:21:00]  door uh i owe my daughter money and i'm dodging it i know the struggle  well the politically uh incorrect uh jokes i don't know he's a guy that could get away with it though  oh yeah you know the grease man he didn't really tell a joke but you know a little off-color remark  there and now that's it yeah well hey what uh ali yeah yeah you did some other take the stage again

[00:31:00]  the easter eggs that are uh hidden on some of these uh dvds hey i gotta ask you a question  mr dvd very uh uh a big dvd coming out and it seems to be uh being pitched as the dvd of all  time planet of the apes the remake um what kind of features are going to be on this thing  and is it worth it since the movie blew comments mr i've uh i've seen it and you're  right the movie's pretty indifferent um but there are some great featurettes on it things like makeup 
[00:31:30]  tests stunt test footage two different commentary tracks and what about this changing of camera  angles there are there is stuff where you can use a multi-angle feature to like mock edit the film  mock edit the film why don't they give the public the opportunity to do that before they released it  might have played out a little better the multi-angle feature very few discs use it but you can use it  for stuff like on the matrix you use it to activate these small making of featurettes on the disc and what 
[00:32:00]  have you so you know it gives people a different perspective but it's still the same crappy movie  do you need a different perspective if you're a guy that goes out and gets laid uh i'm not sure i gotta  tell you uh the stuff on planet of the apes is pretty interesting but you're right a great dvd can't  make a bad film good but it can make a bad film interesting ah where i heard that before last time he was  on oh right last time thank you boss i knew i had heard that before and it was last week yeah yeah 
[00:32:30]  we enjoy mr dvd hey mr dvd did you see harry potter yes i did actually what'd you think of the harry potter  movie you know um it's weird because it's two and a half hours long it's like the gone with the wind of  kids movies but all the kids there enjoyed it all the grown-ups seem to enjoy it the tone is pretty  much perfect and it was way better than i expected from you know the director of bicentennial man and  mrs doubtfire mr dvd i've got a question uh rich voss uh with a question are you rich are you a bottom

Hello, love.  How's it going, guys?  All right, John, what do you have?  Hey, they got one radio station out here near Allentown.  They do Oh Wow Wednesdays.  There's a station in Connecticut that does that, too.  Yeah, it's supposed to be songs you haven't heard in a while.  It's supposed to make you go, oh, wow. 
[01:03:30]  Well, do you have one?  Let's give it a little try.  All right.  Let's see.  How about Twisted Sister?  We're not going to take it.  How about that one?  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  I got to step in.  That's not an Oh Wow song.  We can't play that because that's one of our Friday songs.  That's right.  Oh, shoot.  You can't mix those up.  And according to Selector, we played that recently.  We can't play it again.  Hey, guys, one more for you.  One more for you.  Same radio station. 
[01:04:00]  Every morning at 8 o'clock, they do like two or three Led Zeppelin songs, and they call  it Getting the Lead Out.  Yeah, Getting the Lead Out, of course.  That's an AOR staple.  Someone's saying we should pick a new partner by seat number at Fenway Park.  That would be a good one.  I want to do Oh Wow Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Hey, maybe you could get everybody to turn their radios at work up real loud and play  Take This Job and Shove It.  Oh, yeah.  Let the bosses hear it.  The high five at five? 
[01:04:30]  I haven't heard of that one.  I haven't heard of that one, but I'm sure it's five songs at five o'clock.  And then there's the top nine at nine.  Rob, what's up?  And then you do it at ten to be really crazy.  Yeah!  Well, they're already crazy because it's nine instead of ten.  Right.  All countdowns are ten.  Rob, what's up?  Rob?  No, it's Ross.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, I'm from Cleveland.  Yeah.  I'm a first-time listener, but I love your format, guys. 
[01:05:00]  Thank you.  Keep up the good work.  Love the format.  Hey, thank you, Brent.  What's that?  We got to interrupt you because, you know, Buffalo had seven feet of snow, and we got to do the  school closings for today.  Oh, that's right.  We need beds for this, though.  Yes, very important, the school closings.  Every school that's covered in snow is closed.  Thank you.  Can we call ourselves a zoo?  And I want to see if someone could stump us with a joke.  Ah.  First person that stumps us with a joke wins something. 
[01:05:30]  Ten songs are ten grand?  Is that a ten in a row?  Oh, yeah.  Like he's going to just mess up.  I used to love listening to those, and they'd be like, and I think I'm going to miss a song  coming up in the six o'clock hour.  Well, how do you know if...  Oh, well.  I thought it was supposed to be just...  Music montage.  Random thing that happened.  Real quick clips of the songs?  Come on.  Where's our music montage?  If you guess all 27 songs included in the montage, that's great. 
[01:06:00]  Well, there you go.  Oh, Earl has picked out an Oh, Wow Wednesday song.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Earl.  Are you going to let us know what it is, or should we just play it?  All right.  Here's today's Oh, Wow Wednesday song.  What's this?  I do, they rock.  Oh, wow.  This is Ian Dury, right?  Oh, no.  Tim Curry, right?  Not Ian Dury and the Blockheads.  No, this is... 
[01:06:30]  This is Tim Curry.  He just said, well, give me readings for Team Moscow.  Is it?  I look at the champion.  I know.  This is...  Oh, wow.  The truth hanging picture.  Oh, wow.  Who gives a...  That was making me.  Let's go to Philly.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You want to play psychic trivia?  What is that?  What's psychic trivia?  Where have we been?  The station in Philly, the station that wanted to hire you guys, their morning show plays 
[01:07:00]  psychic trivia, and the idea is that if you listen to the show all morning, something  goofy happened during the day, and they're going to say, okay, here's the question.  Okay, you got it?  Now, come up and give us the answer.  You guys are...  And you have to guess what they're thinking about.  Ho, ho!  Guys, how about the phrase that pays?  Yeah.  What's the phrase that pays?  I think you're drinking out of a mule.  Oh, that's correct.  You win.  We're going to call up random houses during the day, and you have to answer the phone 
[01:07:30]  with the phrase that pays.  So all your friends think you're a complete blithering tool.  What is today's phrase that pays?  You have to answer and say, hello, baby...  Oh, wait.  We got someone that wants to stump us with a joke, you guys.  All right.  Hey, what's up, guys?  We should have wacky music, man.  All right, hold on.  We got to get some music for a bit.  You know, something wacky.  I am digging the new format.  That's great. 
[01:08:00]  I'm liking it.  And it's much better than anyone else's, because we're incorporating every single one of these  things into one show.  All right, Anthony, we got a new...  Some people just take one or two of these genius things and do it during their program.  Here it is.  Rick's got something for our...  All right.  ...our little joke-off.  Joke-off.  Ha-ha.  Hub-la-hub-la-bop.  All right, here we go.  Ah!  What the hell is that, Rick?  This stinks.  Kid-toucher music.  Sorry, wrong game.  This is like the music we used to play for our evil barn. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  I'll give you a quarter if I can get it.  A quarter of the way in.  50 cents if it goes halfway in.  A dollar if it goes in all the way.  All right, listen.  You got some music you hear when you start feeling guilty about what you've just done.  Andrew.  What's up, O&A?  What's up?  You got a joke for us today?  Yeah, long-time listener.  Love your show.  Is it a joke you can find...  Is it a joke you can find in a typical joke book?  I don't believe so.  Uh-oh.  All right, check it out.  There's three ebony women in the ghetto on the street corner. 
[01:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  They're all wearing non-book potato sacks.  How do you know which one's the prostitute?  Ah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Huh.  Hmm-hmm.  Well, now give us time.  Give us time.  I got it.  You guys...  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Norton's got it.  Hold on in the background.  She's the one with the hole cut out right where it is.  That's better.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's not how you play.  Oh, listen to that language.  Oh, no.  Dive, dive. 
[01:09:30]  Can I give it to you?  Wait, hold on.  All right.  If we're going to do this bit, we've got to get at least five or six people that give  us jokes that we know, and then, you know, the seventh one will stump us, and then we  can move on to something else.  You're crazy, Norton.  Whoa.  He's crazy.  Guys, this is my first time calling.  You can't let me tell you.  Ah, that's it.  All right, hold on.  So, uh, what's the joke again, Andrew?  All right.  There's three black women standing on a street corner wearing nothing but potato sacks.  How do you know which one's the prostitute?  How do you know which one is the prostitute? 
[01:10:00]  They're wearing gunny sacks or potato sacks?  Potato sacks.  Huh?  Yeah.  Hmm.  This is very difficult.  I...  Uh...  Sounds like my mother-in-law.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a chick.  Hold on.  I'm going to have a beer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah.  There we are.  Oh, nothing better than a good beer. 
[01:10:30]  Uh, what's the...  Hold on.  I'm going to crank one out.  Oh, that's all right.  Yeah, I just thought I'd crank one out.  Oh, that's all right.  You guys rock.  What's the answer to the joke?  All right.  She's the one that the potato sacks says, Idaho.  Idaho.  Yeah, we got it.  Ho, ho, ho.  We're not adding that bit to our format because we stink at it.  Hey, guys, I want to win that prize.  The first caller's not supposed to get it.  I know.  Hey, guys, I stumped you.  I want to win a prize.  You get nothing. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wait, uh, Ernie's got something.  Ernie, uh, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How about flush the format?  That's when you get rid of the format and you just do what you would want to do.  Come whatever off the top of your head.  Flush the...  Is that what we were just doing?  Before we got our new format?  Well, sorry, some stations do flush the format.  If they play, like, rock music or something, all of a sudden they're like,  well, we're going to flush the format, and next thing you know they do 20 minutes of, like, reggae music.  Uh, O.P., I'd just like to read off the, uh, school lunch menu for the local school. 
[01:11:30]  Uh, chicken nuggets.  They're going to have a choice of a pork egg roll, uh, steamed rice, corn on the cob,  some cherry applesauce, chilled peaches with plum-dried cranberries, no salad, sorry,  and, of course, your choice of milk.  There it is, the school lunch menu.  We need a character, though, that, like, a wacky, uh...  Hello?  Hello, it's Professor Joke Guy.  Hi, Professor Joke Guy.  How are you today?  Very good. 
[01:12:00]  I have a joke for you.  Oh, great, Professor Joke Guy.  What happens when the local medicine factory has a quiet day?  Uh, what happens?  I don't know.  No, you've got to repeat it.  I don't know, Professor Joke Guy.  What happens when the local medicine factory has a quiet day?  You can hear a cough drop!  Oh, he's incorrigible! 
[01:12:30]  Looking forward to hearing him the same exact time tomorrow.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I want to do the, uh, car phone check-in.  The what?  The car phone check-in.  What the hell is the car phone check-in?  You call in and you say what road you're on.  Like, you're like, hey, I'm on Route 50.  I got a dead hooker in the trunk.  And, uh, Rig-O-Mortis is about to set in.  So I gotta go.  Yeah, the car phone check-in, man.  All right, very good.  Big in D.C.  All right.  All right.  Maybe we'll do something when my wife calls in and talks for four hours.  Ah, that'd be great. 
[01:13:00]  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Got a joke for you guys.  Oh, are you going to try to stump us?  Yep, I'm going to stump you.  All right.  What does a gay horse eat?  What does a gay horse eat?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Um.  Um.  People are probably screaming at their radio.  What does a gay horse eat? 
[01:13:30]  Um.  Um.  Let's see.  The.  Um.  Oh, f***.  Closed.  Wait a minute.  You can't say.  How come this new format, we've had to dump ourselves so many times.  Um.  Uh.  Hall and Oats?  Nope.  Oh, that was a good try, though.  Ah.  Uh.  What's the answer, Mark?  Hey.  Oh.  Oh, we stink. 
[01:14:00]  We're all for two.  That's kind of funny.  That's a good joke.  Hey, you got to give it to the guys.  We're all for two, and at this rate, we're going to run out of prizes.  We suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Yep.  What a great new format, though.  I like it.  Uh.  Joe, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, I just heard the song of the day, Start Me Up by the Stones.  I want to guess the high-low jackpot.  The high-low jackpot.  How confusing.  What is that?  The hell is the high-low jackpot?  You hear the song of the day, you got to call in and guess the high-low jackpot? 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  All right.  Take a guess.  $17,224.02.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But you know something, work off of what he said, and maybe that'll help the next person  that guesses.  Was it too high or too low?  That was too high.  Oh, man.  I tell you guys, it's tough, but I'm calling from D.C.  You might believe me.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Evan.  Evan, what's up?  Hey, could you guys pass the bong? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, we were so busy earlier, we forgot to do the 420 bong hit.  420 bong hit.  There we go.  Hey, we're really smoking pot in here.  Party hard.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah.  How's that?  Take that with you.  Georgia!  Later.  Georgia!  Kyla, what's up?  Hey, can I be today's dashboard DJ?  What the hell is that?  You want to be today's dashboard DJ for the day?  Well, I pull over to the side of the road and I'm out for the next song on my cell phone. 
[01:15:30]  Dashboard DJ!  All right, Kyla, you're today's dashboard DJ.  Oh, please, let me just scream the fire's in a wall.  Boy, I hope it's a song we play.  Oh, gosh.  Here, at WAW 1027, we're going to play Leonard Skinner's.  Dashboard DJs!  Thank you so much, guys, and have a great day.  Thank you.  Every day is your chance to be a dashboard DJ.  All you need is a phone in your car, and you can be a dashboard DJ. 
[01:16:00]  Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama.  You heard our dashboard DJ just call this one, and you can too.  Every day, our dashboard DJs are announcing the songs we play here for you.  Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama, O&A Show.  Oh, you're a little rusty.  I was a little short, and you didn't hit the post there.  I was enjoying that.  I got it on a beat.  It was dashboard DJ. 
[01:16:30]  Close, but you know what?  If we were really good at this, we'd have the song playing as she was requesting.  I know.  Like, how do they do that?  How do they know that she was going to request a song that's playing in the background?  Now we need somebody to do that.  That would be terrible.  This is fun, though.  It is fun.  Another caller wants to try to stump us with a joke.  All right.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  What did the dog say when he sat on sandpaper? 
[01:17:00]  What did the dog say when he sat on sandpaper?  Rough.  Oh, my God.  You're not stopping us.  You're not stopping us tonight.  Sorry, sir.  You lose.  Goodbye, guys.  Bye.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, can we play secret sound?  Guess the sound effect.  Do we have a secret sound? 
[01:17:30]  Do we have a sound effect?  I'd like to.  I am the 100th caller.  All right.  Let's see.  Norton, do you have a secret sound sound effect for us?  I certainly do.  Let me hear.  Oh, no.  No, not that one.  Oh, you're giving too many hints out.  Here's the secret sound. 
[01:18:00]  What is that, Doug?  Monica Lewinsky?  Yeah.  It's a BJ joke.  Always funny.  Anthony, what's up?  That's right.  Here's the rest of the sound.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm on 495 sitting in traffic.  I'm in a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer with my friends just checking in.  Well, you know what kind of car I'm driving.  What is that? 
[01:18:30]  Hot 97 does that.  You call in and you see what kind of car you're driving.  Why?  Why do they want you to?  Hot 97.  Why do they want you to call in with what kind of car you stole?  So they can jack it from you.  I don't know, man.  They just call up and say what kind of car they're driving.  Well, that sounds like a good little bit there.  I got a joke to stump you guys with.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You set up for this.  Boy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was unexpected.  Hold on.  We're not prepared.  I got to get the joke music back.  Go ahead. 
[01:19:00]  Stump us with a joke, sir.  All right.  Why do blacks have flat noses?  Why do blacks have flat noses?  This sounds a little risque for our show.  I might want to call the grease man with this type of racial humor.  Or Muhammad Ali.  Or Muhammad Ali.  Yeah, he seems to like the racy jokes himself.  We'll get into that story next.  I can't.  I don't want to go near this one.  Yeah, yeah.  You know something, sir?  We are going to opt to stay safe here. 
[01:19:30]  This is a little too hot to handle.  And not continue with this joke, sir.  A little risque.  Where about unity?  I understand.  Where about unity in the community?  I understand.  Well, what is the answer if we...  That would be...  That's where God put his foot when he ripped their tails off.  Oh, my.  Good night, guys.  No.  You know, that type of thing is not going to be tolerated on our radio show.  That is awful.  This is... 
[01:20:00]  You know, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell people we all have to get together in this time after we've all seen such a tragedy together.  I feel a fake suspension coming on.  We're going to be checking in with Spuds Buckley in a little bit, so stick around.  I don't know if he gives me the finger.  Hey, how about the bit where you drive a bit into the ground?

Well, see, me and my girlfriend, we were having sex the other night.  And I've been seeing her for about a year.  And she never lets me go for the balloon knot.  Right.  Wow!  So I'm going and...  That came in perfectly. 
[01:23:00]  She never lets me go for the balloon knot.  Wow!  So I think she'll try it.  You know, she's really against it.  She doesn't want to do it.  So I think, you know, you don't knock until you try it.  Right.  So I go for it.  Wow!  Wow!  I think it's everything, man.  She gave you the fish eye.  She gave you the fish eye?  Yeah.  You want to explain the fish eye, Anthony?  The fish eye is when you're going at it normal in the dog-like fashion, let's say. 
[01:23:30]  And then in one move, during withdrawal, you now are going back.  And instead of the regular way, you go into the balloon knot.  Which is a big surprise for the lady.  Very big surprise.  She will turn her head around and look at you over her shoulder with an eye that looks  like the fish's eye.  Like a fish eye.  Like a...  Like a...  Like a...  A garami. 
[01:24:00]  Or a flounder or something.  Just gazing at you.  Black eye.  Lifeless eye.  Like a doll's eye.  Well, she let out a yell like a chihuahua, man.  Yeah!  And, uh...  Wow!  Yeah, yeah.  You got it.  You got it.  Well, she dumped me.  She dumped you because you, uh, went for that move?  Yeah, she knew how...  She dumped you because you dumped her.  They slept on in that.  You're not eating stars.  You're not eating stars. 
[01:24:30]  Well, she dumped me, man.  And I'm real worried about it.  I know she listens to your show.  And I just...  I want to...  Jess, if you're out there, just call up the show or something.  I miss you.  Baby, come back.  I didn't mean to assist you there.  Baby, come back.  I was wrong.  Well, trying to stick you there.  That's right.  Ooh!  Hey, Tom, what's going on? 
[01:25:00]  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, I got a little, uh, six-line poem here about stuff's been going on on the show.  You want to hear it?  Oh!  Oh.  Oh, one of these.  Scott.  Hey, it's really good, and, uh, it'll all go through.  Yeah, we love poems.  It was a dick named Dice Clay.  Technical Virgin, he was twice today.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you lost me already.

[01:29:00]  This song made me violent.  This is awful.  This is made me violent.  This is the so tail end of this friggin' music.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I almost got you so jumpy.  I almost got you so jumpy.  I can't wait for the bops no more.  I'm crazy.  Bops.

[01:31:30]  Bopping with traffic and I have to roll up my windows because I'm going to look that like  I'm insane.  Well, that's another part of the bit.  We crank up lousy music and you've got to roll your windows up real quick.  That sucks.  You've got to queue that up every time Dice goes out of bop.  Yeah.  Next time he does his bop, we'll have that music ready for him.  Bop music.  Bop.  Bop.  Bop.  Bop music.  Bop.  Talk about bop.  Talk about bop music.  Bop.  Bop.  Wasn't that the band M?

We're all riding on the same spaceship.  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  And are you singing?  That's better.  Did you sing?  Yeah, I'll sing it on the, on the, on the, also, I got a little, a little help from some  other people.  Right.  And it's quite an exciting piece.  Have you played it?

Funny you should ask.  Ah, ha, ha.

Look at that one!  Hey, buddy.  That's an idea of how old I am.  I like that.  But anyway, as long as she keeps opening the door, that's fine.  That's right.  That's right.  You still got a lot of spunk there, buddy, don't you? 
[01:36:30]  I'm thinking you're like 95, buddy.  Pardon?  I think you're 95 years old, huh?  How old?  95?  Uh, not 95 yet.  No, I don't think so.  I don't keep, uh, I don't keep score.  Yeah.  I just, you know, I live by one action.  Use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  We got that one.  We got that one.  Of course.  You got that?  I like that.  We like that from you.  Buddy, can I ask a favor of you?  Oh, no.  That's it. 
[01:37:00]  I, I, uh, of course, your beloved character, uh, Jed Clampett from, uh, the Beverly Hillbillies.  Yeah.  We all remember it.  Lives on, uh, in syndication on, on, uh, where, where is that being played now?  That Nickelodeon, maybe?  That Nickelodeon.  All of it.  Yeah.  Nickelodeon, yeah.  We love it.  And you, you did the well doggy, uh, back then.  Can we hear a little, uh, Buddy Epson saying, well doggy?  Well, I usually use that for, if I get offline.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  When we're all through talking, I'll give you, you know, well doggy.  Well, I, I, I just want to, I just want to hear it all.  One run right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we'll get off another.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Well doggy.  All right.  Yay.  Just like I remember from Buddy Epson.  Pretty good.  That's not bad at all, Buddy.  Now, Buddy, where are you, this CD you got out?  Is this a new CD?  Yeah.  Well, it's, uh, it's on, uh, uh, Buddy Epson's originals. 
[01:38:00]  Now, this is a song that you recorded, uh, a few years back?  Yes, you recorded it and re-recorded it and, and, uh, and smartened it up a little bit  so that, so that it, uh, it sounds better.  Oh, I gotcha.  That's, uh, not really.  Available on springboundmusic.com.  Oh, look at you all over the web.  Springbound.com.  On the web.  Or buddyepson.com on the web.  All right.  Or, uh, a phone call for 888-280-7715. 
[01:38:30]  Uh, Buddy's doing business.  I like that.  I see, uh, on the front page of buddyepson.com, we see you in a little, uh, Santa hat for Christmas  with a saxophone.  With a saxophone?  Very cute picture there, Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, you, uh, you got a gal in your life?  Yeah, I played the saxophone since I was in high school.  All right.  And that's where I graduated at Tech Spedicky.  I worked with him for a while. 
[01:39:00]  Uh, let me read the caption.  Buddy playing a saxophone Christmas 2001.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Mr. Epson, if people order your CD from eatabullet.com, how many songs are on it?  No, that's buddyepson.com.  Uh, no, I agree.  Buddyepson.com.  This is, uh, awesome legend, you idiot.  They're 14 on the CD, and the favorite turns out to be something I wrote from a two-and-a-half-year-old  granddaughter called Angelica.  Did you hear that one?  I didn't hear that one.  We're going to have to give that a listen. 
[01:39:30]  Well, I'll give you the first line.  All right.  Okay.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who?  Angelica!  Who broke the milk bottle out on the drive?  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive?  Who spilled their mommy's Chanel number five?  Who?  Angelica! 
[01:40:00]  Very good.  All right, buddy.  Hey, I like that.  Do you have any grandchildren?  Uh, no, not yet, buddy.  I'm hoping to have my first grandchild very soon.  We're still working on kids, possibly.  You'll remember that song when you get a grandchild.  My grandchild.  I'm going to, I'm going to listen to them.  They have a way of getting into things.  Yeah, I bet they do.  They cause a ruckus around the house, right?  A little bit of a ruckus. 
[01:40:30]  Buddy, you got grand, uh, great-grandkids?  What?  Do you have great-grandkids?  Any great, any great-grandchildren?  Oh, no, no, not that I know of.  No?  Oh, hey, back in the day.  They may be keeping something from me, but I don't know of any.  Buddy, can you sing a line from another song on your CD, maybe?  A couple of little verses?  A couple of verses of what?  Any of the other songs that we can find on your CD?  Oh, I got a lot of songs. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, you want some, um, some, uh, character songs like, uh, Wild Card or, uh, Baby Blues or, uh,  Oh, well, any, any.  Snowshoe Thompson.  How about Snowshoe Thompson?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Yeah, let's hear that.  Snowshoe Thompson.  You want to hear a little of that?  Yeah, let's hear a little of that from Buddy.  All right, here we go.  Snowshoe Thompson used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail.  He had no dogs and he had no sled, but one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man, go, gotta get on through the snow. 
[01:41:30]  Mush, man, mush, gotta get on through the snush.  Go, man, go, means mush and Eskimo.  So go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  Yeah, there was his body.  The land is down and the birds is walking on the ground and the snow is rifted treetop tall  and nobody getting through at all.  Oh, go, man, go.  It goes on like that.  Oh, yeah, it goes on like that.  Nice one, Buddy.  Very good, Buddy.  And it's all available on Buddy's CD. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, Buddy.  It's got a lift on the last chorus.  Yeah.  So remember now when your daze is grim and the drift is tall and your hopes is slim  and you don't see how you're going to get through.  Old snowshoe made it and so can you.  So go, man, go.  Gotta get on through the snow.  There we are.  A little lesson to be learned.  There you go.  A lesson to be learned.  There you go, Buddy.  Don't quit.  That's inspirational.  Hey, Buddy, last time you were on our show, you were singing a dirty version of the Beverly 
[01:42:30]  Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version?  Well, it was kind of a...  Saucy.  Saucy little parody version of that.  The closest thing to a dirty version.  Of course, I sang a song from the hillbillies called, Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, doggies. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  It goes on like that.  It goes on like that, Buddy.  What?  It goes on like that then, huh?  It goes on like that.  That's the kind of lyrics they're writing today.  Right.  Right.  That's what the kids are listening to.  Hey, I got an idea.  Buddy, could you do that again?  I want to help you along with that song.  You want to help me along with it?  Yeah, hold on.  I'll tell you.  Well, I got parts of it.  I'll tell you when.  Hold on, hold on.  I like that.  What was that?  The Well Doggy song? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Well, a Well Doggy song.  Yeah, give us a little more of that.  A little more Well Doggy?  Yeah, do it again.  I haven't written a song about Well Doggy.  Well, do it again because we won't.  Well, what I'll do, you'll hear it on springboundmusic.com.  Page out of the old plug book.  Yeah.  But I got a variation on Well Doggy's.  Oh, you do?  Not Well Doggy's, but another song that I wrote. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  And, oh, wait a minute.  Did you get the phone number in case you can't get the book?  Oh, yeah, we got the phone number.  You want to give it out again, buddy?  888-280-7715.  There you go.  And here is the middle part of the song.  Okay, let's hear.  The postman came the first of May.  The mailman came the very next day.  Nine months later, there was hell to pay. 
[01:44:30]  Who fired the first shot?  The blue and the gray.  Well, babies.  Well, babies.  Oh, I get you.  That's a little racy there, buddy.  Is that what you wanted?  Yeah.  That's some war humor.  You asked for something racy?  Firsthand.  That's as racy as I get.  That's as racy as you get?  Yeah.  Buddy, weren't you writing a parody version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme song?  A parody version?  What?  Well, I wrote another version of it.  It's not a parody.  Oh, okay.  It's inspired by the Ballad of Jed Clamp. 
[01:45:00]  See, that's what I think he was trying to do last time.  You'll get it when they send you the full CD.  Oh, can we hear a little bit of it from you live, maybe?  Well, I don't know.  It's so unique.  Yeah.  I don't care.  There's lyrics around in my life.  Oh, yeah.  We thought that I'll ask you.  Okay.  Well, all right.  I got other lyrics, but they're songs that are talking songs, like they used to do on 
[01:45:30]  the radio, like smoke, smoke, smoke, you know, that kind of thing.  Right, right.  All right there, buddy.  Hey, buddy, we love you, man.  Well, thank you very much.  We're going to promote your CD.  It's, I don't know what the name of the CD is.  It's just.  The CD is Buddy's Originals.  Buddy's Originals.  Yeah.  You can go to BuddyEpson.com.  You can go to Springbound.com.  Yeah.  Or you can give Buddy a call, probably personally, at 888. 
[01:46:00]  888.  280.  280.  7715.  7715.  And don't forget, we're all riding on the same spaceship.  Ain't a time we start to get along.  Right.  As the world keeps shrinking, got to find new thinking, so the world can spin right on.  That's inspirational, Buddy.  Thank you so much.  Okay. 
[01:46:30]  Buddy, the great BuddyEpson.  Buddy's got to leave with his well doggy.  That's how he leaves.  Oh, that's right.  One more time, Buddy, if you could leave us with a great well doggy.  Are you ready?  Yes, sir.  You got the recorder going?  Oh, of course.  But here it comes for you.  Hey, you got to really, you know, pump this one out for us.  I'll pump this one out.  Ready?  Here we go.  Well, stogies.  Thank you, BuddyEpson.  BuddyEpson.  Nice.  Got a little out of stick here in the back.  I heard that.  Thank you, Buddy. 
[01:47:00]  I'll be again sometime.  Thank you.  Oh, we will, Buddy.  Believe us.  We love you, Buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll call you tomorrow.  Right.  All right.  The great BuddyEpson, everyone.  There he is.  There's our brand new will doggies.  For BuddyEpson.  For 2002.  For 2002.  I don't think he...  Boy.  He did something.  It's still kind of sharp there.  It was nice of Opie to clap after he gave out a phone number.  That's not quite degrading to it. 
[01:47:30]  I was well-behaved.  It's not too condescending.  No, but of course you're well-behaved, but the man gave out a number and you went, all  right.  All right.  He can speak.  Let me tell you something.  I was looking at the phone lines.  There was this one girl.  She hung up.  It was Lisa.  All Stinky wrote on the line is Lisa going, for the love of God, be nice to him.  Be nice to him.  Be nice to him.  Please, please, please.  She was just freaking.  She was just freaking.  What is this?  The Well Doggy 2002?  Just did it live.  Nice.  Can we now?  All right.  We got to add it to our collection. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Can we have all of them?  We got to line them all up.  We got to line them up and get them all numbered.  Look at us being unpredictable.  See, you bastard.  You thought we were going to be mean.  See?  I know.  Exactly.  Just when you think you know your pals Opie and Anthony.  Some guy said Buddy Ebson rules.  Didn't he fight with Davy Crockett?  Like Mark from Cleveland.  I feel so bad.  Leave this guy alone.  We were very nice to him.  Even when we're nice, people freak out that we're even on the phone with them.  Yeah.  They're turning down their radios going on. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I know it's coming.  I know it's coming.  Not at all.  See?  Sometimes you see the...  Sometimes the lion walks right past the gazelle.  That's right.  You watch those nature shows sometimes and you're watching it.  And sometimes the lion walks right past the gazelle and the gazelle don't even stop drinking.  That's right.  And he walks by and you're thinking, why the hell didn't he tear his throat out?  What about the...  You just can't tell what nature.  What about the alligators and the crocs?  Ah, the alligators and... 
[01:49:00]  Inches away from the gazelles as they're drinking the water.  And the alligator might just...  Oh, he turns off.  Turns away.  Not interesting today.  And not interest.  Just not interesting today.  Something as simple as you throw the mice in the snake tank.  Sometimes the snake don't even pay attention to the mouse.  Sometimes the mouse could just take a nice little nap.  And sometimes the snake plays a canned laughter over the mouse's story of his parents being eaten by a snake.  You never know.  All right.  I got Well Doggy 97, 2001, and 2002. 
[01:49:30]  I got 2000.  Okay, so here we go.  Let's get this right.  You know what?  I'm kind of disappointed.  I think he made a nice comeback last year.  He did.  I think he made a nice comeback.  He did.  He did.  You got to give it to him.  Well, maybe next year.  All right.  Here's Well Doggy 1997 from the great Buddy Epson.  BuddyEpson.com.  Well Doggy.  Nice.  All right.  And here is the year after.  Or 2000.  2000.  2000.  Here.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggy. 
[01:50:00]  A little bad.  All right.  Here's Well Doggy 2001.  Well Doggy.  And ladies and gentlemen, we need like a drum roll.  We don't have one.  Here's Buddy Epson, Well Doggy 2002.  Well Doggy.  All right.  Yeah, he almost sounds better in this one than he did in the last one.  I would say definitely better.  Yeah.  This is last year, 2001.  Well Doggy.  Sounds like a brake screeching on a football. 
[01:50:30]  2002.  Well Doggy.  Give me the 2001.  Give me last year again.  Well Doggy.  I'm like a car accident.  I was talking to one of these earlier.  Oh.  Uh, Lisa.  Yes.  Hey.  Listen, I know the way you two operate, okay?  Why?  I've been listening long enough.  I was just waiting for something from you, okay?  You were scaring me.  I was yelling at the radio.  I know.  It was funny because you were on the line and all I saw was please, please, please be nice 
[01:51:00]  to him.  I was just yelling at whoever answered the phone, no, stop him, please, no.  Oh, we're not going to hurt Buddy.  We've been talking to Buddy for years.  I know.  And he's been nothing but nice to you guys.  Yes.  And I know the way you operate.  Good cop, bad cop.  We don't want to be predictable, Lisa.  I know.  And that scares me, okay?  We don't want to be predictable.  I know.  But, you know, all Opie needs to do is play some soundbite and the man won't even understand  what's happening, okay?  Lisa, they had my hands tied behind my back.  Good, good.  I'm glad someone there has some sense of decency. 
[01:51:30]  I was in a straight jacket for that last 15 minutes.  Thank God.  My heart was, like, beating.  I'm like, no, please.  I love that.  Do you know how many great, great clips we got from Buddy just in that call alone?  With Buddy going, like, where are you, where are you, where are you?  Well, that's the one I want.  Can you get the Well Doggy song?  I like the way you made him say it a few times because you know he's not making it to 2003.  Well Doggy, well Doggy, well.  Buddy says, Buddy says.  Well Doggy, well Doggy, well.  Well Doggy, doggy. 
[01:52:00]  He was doing a Well Doggy rant.  And the doggies get it in the back.  Oh, boy.  Dennis has a problem with our Buddy Epson interview.  Dennis?  Hey, let's remember you guys are being all, you know, proud that you guys weren't mean to Buddy Epson.  Proud?  Well, sort of.  Let's remember the real reason why you guys started calling him was to get the last interview before he died.  We gave up on that years ago, so we spun the bit differently. 
[01:52:30]  You are so right.  The first time we talked to him in 1997, that is what, now five years ago, we were convinced he wasn't even going to make it to spring that year.  And we wanted the last interview with Buddy Epson, so we kept calling him.  And who would have thought we could have called so many other people to get that last interview?  Exactly, you morbid bastards.  You got a good memory, but we spun it now.  We don't care about the last interview.  Exactly.  It's all about the ONA spin.  All right.  Very good. 
[01:53:00]  Norton rules.  Thank you, sir.  We'll be back with the Opian Anthony show.  Stay there.  Raunchy audio.  Look like a dog for me.  Spankable video.  I got my thing in my hand here.  All the best parts of the Opian Anthony show end up on foundrymusic.com.  And E. W.  Oh, I love this.  Sports guys, 6 to 10 in the morning.  We just screw people's days up.  Don and Mike are the coolest.  Plus, I heard Mike likes Jameson.  ONA.  I love those guys saying I'm going to blow up.  I want to blow stuff up with them. 
[01:53:30]  Ron and Fez, you know what I think about Porella Fez.  He's off.  1027.  WNEW.  The Opian Anthony show.  1027.  WNEW.  I feel so alive.  For the very first time.  I can't deny you.  I feel so alive.  I feel so alive.  For the very first time. 
[01:54:00]  And I think I can fly.  Al Gore, Anthony.  Al Gore.  What is the latest on Al Gore, who was, what, five votes short of being the president?  As we all remember, that election was so close.  So close.  And Al Gore lost it.  A lot of people still debate that fact.  Thinking that those Florida ballots were tampered with or whatnot. 
[01:54:30]  They always say that George W. stole the election.  But right now, who would you rather have?  I'd rather have George W. in there.  You know?  Because we tried out the Democratic angle.  We tried the Clinton way to do things.  And I don't think Gore's way would have been much different.  And, you know, Clinton turned his back for eight years on when these people would blow our stuff up and kill our people.  I think it's time now that we have the president like we have in there now, George W., to kick a little ass. 
[01:55:00]  So, yeah, they say that it was taken from Al Gore.  Very close election.  Well, what's Al doing now?  He's running the family restaurant in Tennessee.  How is he not killing himself?  Oh, my God.  Five votes short of being the president of the United States.  And now he's running the family restaurant.  Hey, let me tell you this, too.  Don't, for a second, believe this guy isn't crushed by this. 
[01:55:30]  Isn't destroyed by this.  Of course you can tell by it.  He gave those speeches.  He gave the speeches and talked about, no, we've got to move on.  We've got to support our president.  It's okay.  I'm going to stand behind our system of government.  This guy wanted so badly to be president of the United States.  That's the only reason he kissed that Clinton's ass for eight years.  He wanted to be the president.  He was the president, as reported, shortly before the polls closed by all the news stations. 
[01:56:00]  And now he is running the family restaurant in Tennessee.  As George W. Bush, the weight of the free world rests on his shoulders.  And Al Gore is serving up some home fries.  Like you said in the office, George Bush giving orders.  Al Gore taking orders.  With that beard of his.  Walking around.  He has a beard now?  He's got this beard. 
[01:56:30]  He's all fat.  He looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  He's lost even more hair.  It's really, really bad.  He grew a beard.  He walks around.  I'm a man just like you.  I'm Alfred.  He says, this has been a time of transition for me and it hasn't been easy.  For example, there's usually a lot of cars on the road.  Now it takes longer to get around.  And given that I haven't driven for eight years, I'm not sure.  Gore, it's too wise to drive, said Gore. 
[01:57:00]  Who was driven in a limousine while he was vice president.  Of course he was.  This is a guy that didn't have to sit in traffic.  There were motorcades and police vehicles that cleared the way.  They shut the roads down when he'd come to town.  And now he's stuck just like you and I.  Know what's funny?  He's probably been stuck in traffic as they moved the president around.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch.  That's my car.  So, he says he's started a new family enterprise in his home state. 
[01:57:30]  He says here, we've started a family restaurant in Tennessee and we're running it ourselves.  Oh, God damn.  That's what Al's doing.  And it says it's a low, you missed the last sentence.  It is a low cost restaurant.  Yeah, a low cost restaurant.  Well, I guess he's trying to help.  You know, help some of the people out.  Like trash.  As George W. Bush is sitting there going, should we nuke him? 
[01:58:00]  There's Al Gore going, no, we'll nuke it.  As he, you know, pushing the button.  His finger's on the button.  The microwave.  Isn't that horrible?  I feel bad for him now.  Employee of the month.  Sitting right there, his picture.  Used to be vice president Al Gore.  Now he's employee of the month.  Hope you had a nice ****.  Cleaning big hairy pee, the word, off of the mirror. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, do you think you could get me a job at All-American Burger?  Please wait while former powerful man in the free world seats you.  Think he has to wear a goofy outfit?  Oh, you've got to wear a little cook hat and a little pirate hat.  Hey, have some pride.  Have some pride.  Those boys at IBM.  Need a fit, Trout Burger. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Could you see that?  The guy was vice president.  And, like we said, very close to being president of the United States.  And now he's slinging hash.  How the mighty have fallen.  Taking orders.  There he is in the bathroom after he gets all the work.  Looking out the window.  Phoebe.  And Phoebe Cates in the pool.  Still in his family restaurant uniform.  Have some pride.  Remember that guy? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, what a prick.  Isn't anybody effing dark?  This is not the best breakfast I've ever had.  Al Gore.  I'm going to kick 100% of your ass.  He's in the cruising vessel.  Driving around.  Yeah.  Goes to his wife.  I think we need time away from each other. 
[02:00:00]  I'm a single successful guy.  The dream police.  Da-da-da-da.  All right.  Poor son of a bitch now.  He's just there.  Here's, you know, George W. pointing out places on the map.  Afghanistan.  We're going to bomb.  And there's Al pointing out things on the menu.  Blue plate special.  You might like this.  His one black employee is busted scalping Ozzy Osbourne tickets.  Hey, Rack.  Where'd you get that? 
[02:00:30]  Out of the hamper?  Does Al Gore drive to work in a 78 Gremlin with a piece of cardboard covering the word prick?  What happened?  I was having a great day.  All right.  You guys had shirts on when you came in here.  Something must have happened to him, man.  No shirt.  No shoes.  No dice.  See how that sign in there? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Poor guy.  Thank you, bro.  I believe I'm going to eat my meal.  Look at you, Al.  You're a member of the honor roll.  Assistant to the assistant manager of the restaurant.  I'm telling you, Al.  This girl can't smell your qualifications.  Who needs her, right?  Hey, hit the post.  You need the attitude, Al.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  Now, when you got that, then you got the attitude.  Poor Al.  He's running a goddamn restaurant.  Now, we all know this is inside two of Led Zeppelin 4.  I shall serve no fries before their time. 
[02:02:00]  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, I wonder if Bill Buckner is his business partner.  Poor Bill Buckner, too.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Ed, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I just wondered if Al Gore's restaurant was called This Close.  Well, that would be a good name for the restaurant.  Welcome to This Close.  Welcome to This Close.  Can I help you?  Horseshoes and hand grenades.  Imagine he's got to just sit.  He's just got to sit there and think, I was almost the president. 
[02:02:30]  He's part of the day-to-day operations?  Of course he is.  He's there.  Dude, that's all he's got to do.  Hi, welcome to Gore's.  Can I take your order?  Yeah, Al, I'd like a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla shake.  It's a cheeseburger, onion rings, and a shake.  No, you almost president tool.  I said fries, jackass.  Shake machine's broken.  I'm fixing it now. 
[02:03:00]  Could I have a Coke, then?  We have Pepsi.  Is that okay?  Does it ever matter?  If I ask for Coke, do you have to say Pepsi?  I don't care.  A cola.  We have our own Gore Cola here that we mix ourselves.  It's part of our family thing.  Could you excuse me while I shoot myself in the head?  Could someone please keep the Secret Service man away from me?  You want it supersized?  Hey, you were almost the president, weren't you?  Shut the F up and drive around, please. 
[02:03:30]  How awful must that be?  Hey, Dixon, what's up?  Hey, this is Dixon.  I'm Philly.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, um, you think he's got an apron that says, uh, Hail to the Chef?  I think it's a theme restaurant.  It's like famous losers of all time.  Hail to the Chef.  Oh, wow.  You guys suck.  Oh, my God.  You sure you don't want to come inside and eat at one of our tables?  We got brand new placemats.  We got brand new Dewey Defeats Truman placemats. 
[02:04:00]  Well, that's a history joke, people.  All right.  This new special on the menu is the Tipper Burger.  It's a C surrounded by fat on a bun.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Rob?  Hey, I was wondering if on the list of pies, if Humble was on there.  Humble pie, yes.  Oh, that's awful.  Very good.  Thank you, you guys.  Welcome to Al Gore's.  Can I take your order?  Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pippa. 
[02:04:30]  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Oh, hush puppy.  We ain't got time for that crap.  Maybe I'll call it Big Al's.  Fonzie will show up.  They got a picture on the Internet of Al wearing his apron at the restaurant.  Yeah, you see that?  Dude, it's him.  He's wearing an apron.  He's shaved.  That's what he does.  Man, he shaved the beard.  Poor bastard.  I wear a hairnet.  Does he work with Patty? 
[02:05:00]  Hi, Al.  Al just gave me a job.  It's my 18th job so I can pay the rent.  I'm working the fray later.  On the Internet, it says,  Poor old Al working as a waiter.  View more pictures here.  That's fantastic.  That poor son of a bitch.  How the hell did he lose that election?  That's it.  Chris from Philly.  Gore's restaurant was five votes away from being the best restaurant in Tennessee. 
[02:05:30]  Tommy Mac from South Jersey.  Al Gore's menus come with a hole puncher and you punch out the chads to select your food.  That would be good.  No, I'm sure you wanted the eggs.  No, I didn't.  I didn't want them over easy.  I wanted the omelet.  No, I see over easy here is where you punched out.  The chad didn't disconnect.  Tom, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you go to Al Gore's restaurant.  You mention his name, you get a free glass of wine. 
[02:06:00]  A free glass of wine in the house.  Ah, go down to Al Gore's of Mulberry Street.  Ask for Al, you get a glass of wine in the house.  Let's go to Paul.  Are there pictures of Al with celebrities signed on the walls down there at Al's place?  Yeah, I think he has a picture of Jay Moore, Andrew Dice Clay.  The Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik.  Paulie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Paulie from Lawrence.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a theme song for the Gore restaurant. 
[02:06:30]  Okay.  There's a new Gore in town.  That's all I got.  There's Al Gore.  Early to bed.  I cooked and cleaned and went out of my head.  Oh, no, there's one.  Please drop around.  Kiss my grits.  Look for me.  There's a new Allentown and I'm looking good. 
[02:07:00]  There's a fresh, freckled face in the neighborhood.  There's a new Allentown.  Brand new style.  She won't just pass it through.  Pass it through.  But if things go, I'm just gonna stay a while. 
[02:07:30]  Could you shoot me?  I'm Al Gore, Lily.  Yeah, all right.  We gotta order new stuff.  Order some meat.  Let's order some potatoes and order some ammo for my nine.  There's a new Allentown and I'm looking good.  God, she had to sing her own theme song.  What a plot.  Hey, at least I'm not Rich Voss. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, wow.  That, wow.  I didn't even see that one coming.  That had a hurt.  All right, we better take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Stay there.  I like guys who like boobs as much as me.  So I listen to O&A.  They got a lot of boob leverage.  I big on boobs, so leverage me out.  I want to be a part of it even if I have to just sit in there and answer phones.  I don't care.  I want to be a phone speeder so I can get more boobs around my face.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Shake it up.  And E.W.  When I get angry watching games on TV,  I typically throw things at the television set or the television set gets thrown. 
[02:08:30]  Typically, I like to destroy things when my team's losing.  Only, though, if I have money bet on them.  Scott Farrell has joined Blaine Ansley on the Sports Guys Morning Show.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony, New York Sports Clubs.  What is this?  I don't know.  I can just tell you this, man.  I'm a workout fiend lately with New York Sports Clubs  because they've made it really easy for me to work out, Anthony.  Very good.  With the latest equipment.  They keep their equipment up to date.  They've got the cardio machines.  Now I've got these little headphone things.

They have all the latest equipment.  Great classes.  And you're going to get in shape.  That's right.  And very important, month-to-month memberships at New York Sports Club.

My band Lounge Against the Machine on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'd like to do a number for you. 
[02:10:00]  By a special cat named Trent Reznor.  And his fine band Nine Inch Nails.  You let me violate you.  You let me desecrate you.  Yes, you do.  You let me penetrate you.  You let me complicate you.  Help me.  I broke apart my insides. 
[02:10:30]  Help me.  I've got no soul to sell.  Help me.  The only thing that works for me.  Help me get away from myself.  I want to F you like an animal.  I want to feel you from the inside.  I want to F you like an animal.  My own existence is flawed. 
[02:11:00]  You get me closer to...  Come on!  Yeah!  Closer.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, we've got to talk about Tom Brokaw, Anthony.  Yeah, it seems the competition's really heating up between him and Dan Rather.  Hopefully you've been following the saga on our show the last few months.  Yeah.  Well, the latest, Dan Rather.  Oh, listen to this.  Hey, he's ripping me off. 
[02:11:30]  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  That's pretty good.  Stop it.  That's wonderful.  All right, the latest on Dan Rather.  Well, Dan wants to go to...  I think he is in Afghanistan, right?  Is he over there already?  No, I don't think so.  I know he wants to go really badly.  He might be, like, on a border.  I don't even know where Dan is right now.  Well, basically, Dan Rather wants to go over there to do some reporting. 
[02:12:00]  And now Tom Brokaw, very pissed off, because now, once again, Dan Rather has one up on him.  Yeah, I mean, that's the place to be if you're a reporter.  And it turns out it's a lot more dangerous.  Journalists, eight journalists have been killed.  One American's been killed in combat.  So, you know, the journalists outdoing the military as far as getting themselves killed.  So I don't know if it's safe.  And Geraldo's running around with a cowboy hat.  Good.  But Geraldo looks hysterical.  Put a target on the top of your head.  Have you seen Geraldo? 
[02:12:30]  He's out there.  He's interviewing people.  And he's got this big cowboy hat on.  I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride.  I'm wanted dead alive.  No, no, no, no.  Look at the rest of the cheese.  Hey, we know that one.  We know that one.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Sorry, baby.  So, I don't think it's safe, though, for Tom Brokow, who's 61 years old, to be a trotting  ago.  Picture your grandpa out there trotting across the desert looking for a story.  He wants to be by a marine base at Kandahar. 
[02:13:00]  One of the airstrips that's there that was made into a marine base.  And he wants to hang out with the Marines.  With the Marines, sure.  And I guess get the story.  Well, he wants to get it before Dan Rather, because they're in a fierce competition with  each other lately.  Yeah, that's what it seems to be.  And Peter Jennings, well, he's a pussy.  Peter Jennings is the biggest pussy in the world.  While me and Dan Rather fight it out to see who's going to be an Afghan, Afghan, Afghan. 
[02:13:30]  Peter Jennings wants to stay home.  He's a panty waist.  What's the matter, Jennings?  Are you quitting on me?  Are you quitting on me, Jennings?  Come back to NBC Nightly News.  Jennings, are you quitting on me?  Then quit, you slimy little walrus looking piece of me.  Get the f*** off my obstacle.  Get the f*** down off my obstacle now. 
[02:14:00]  Move it.  I'm going to rip your f*** off so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world.  I will motivate you, Jennings.  You short f*** every f*** on the Congo.  Wait, that was from a movie, Mr. Brokaw.  Hey, I'm inspired by the Marines here.  Well, I hope to be inspired by them when I broadcast in person from the Marine Base at Canada. 
[02:14:30]  Well, Dan Rather is pretty close to broadcasting live from Afghanistan.  Well, I've got a problem with Dan Rather, too.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  My mission with Rather is to proceed up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat, pick up Rather's path in New Bang Ba, follow it, and learn what I can along the way. 
[02:15:00]  When I find Rather, I will infiltrate his team by whatever means available and terminate Rather's command.  Terminate Rather's command with extreme prejudice.  Tom, that's...  That son of a b***h.  That's from a movie.  I don't recall any of that.  I'm inspired.  Just the thought of being over there and saying things and firing weapons and helping the Marines over there just gets me hot.  I feel hot.  That's all I want to do.  Hey, look out. 
[02:15:30]  Here comes the enemy.  A 12 o'clock...  12 o'clock...  12 o'clock...  He's coming right in front of us.  You know, it just makes me feel so good.  Imagine me saying that.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, live from Afghanistan.  You want to be right in the middle of the action.  I want to be right in the action.  I want to...  If somebody gets hit...  Yeah.  You take a look at this lump of...  Remember what he looks like.  You...  Up in a firefight and I goddamn guarantee you a trip out of the bush in a body bag. 
[02:16:00]  Out here...  You keep your...  Wired tight at all times and that goes for you...  For brains.  You don't sleep on no...  Ambush.  And the next son of a bitch I catch copping seeds in the bush.  I'm personally going to take an interest in seeing them suffer.  I...  You not.  Doc Tagham and Bagham.  I'm inspired.  Just the being there. 
[02:16:30]  Look at that.  Do you smell that?  That's napalm, son.  Nothing else in the world smells like that.  I...  I...  I...  I'm attracted to the smell of napalm in the morning.  You know, one time we had a hill bomb for 12 hours.  When it was over, I walked up.  We didn't find one of them.  Not one stinking dink body.  The smell, you know that gasoline smell.  The whole hill smelt like victory. 
[02:17:00]  Someday, the score's gonna end.  Tom, you're not in the Marines, though.  You're just a newsman.  This is wonderful.  I love it.  I love being with the Marines.  God has a...  On for Marines.  Because we kill everything we see.  He plays his games.  We play ours.  To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep heaven packed with fresh souls.  God was here before the Marine Corps.  So you could give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps. 
[02:17:30]  You're not part of the Marines.  I feel like it.  Yeah.  I'd love to go over there.  Look out, look out.  I'll throw my body on a hand grenade.  For my brother, Marine, Marine, Marine, Marine.  I love the military.  Yeah.  Even though I'm 61 years old.  It doesn't matter.  I would just love to get in there and get a piece of the action. 
[02:18:00]  Get Osama's ass.  Yeah, why don't you go in the caves and hunt him?  I'll do that.  I'll be a tunnel rat.  Yeah?  Here I am, Tom Brokaw.  And the nightly news, I'm in the tunnels here in Afghanistan.  And I'm ready to kick some ass.  Come on out, Osama.  Come on, I see you.  I see you.  I didn't start this.  I didn't draw first blood.  I'm just sorry of this.  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:18:30]  Ah!  Adrian!  Oh.  Sorry.  It's a fighting movie.  What are you doing?  It sticks to a regular movie.  That's Rambo.  Yeah.  Blow him up.  Fan monkeys.  I'll kill all the fan monkeys.  There you go.  Kiss my ass.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I can't wait to get over there.  I cannot wait to get over there.  You f***ing tools. 
[02:19:00]  Rather.  Rather.  I'm going to give you three seconds.  There's exactly three f***ing seconds to wipe that stupid looking grin off your face.  Or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull f*** you.  Whoa!  The answer to that one.  You pussy boy.  Rather.  Rather.  You best on f*** yourself and start f*** me Tiffany Cufflings.  Or I will definitely f*** you up.  Rather you will give your rifle a girl's name because this is the only f*** you people are going to get. 
[02:19:30]  Your days of f*** banging old Mary Jane Rottencrotch through her pretty big panties are over.  Rather.  I just love being there.  I can smell it.  Smell it. 
[02:20:00]  Smell it.  Smell it in the air.  Can you?  I can't say it.  But I can smell it.  Let me hear you pronounce Taliban, Tom.  The bad guys.  That's how absolutely Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This ain't your show, Elias.  You sound motivator, Mr. Brokaw. 
[02:20:30]  Well, I am.  Yeah.  Rather was full of s***.  Rather was a crusader.  Now, I ain't got no problem with a man who does what he's told.  But when he don't, the machine breaks down.  And when the machine breaks down, we break down.  And I ain't gonna let that happen from any of you.  Not one.  Looks like Mr. Brokaw watched a lot of movies on the train from Boston.  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[02:21:00]  You've got a lot of DVDs in your back pocket, huh, Mr. Brokaw?  Well, I'm inspired.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, is inspired by victories of the Americans in the past.  Isn't it?  You're here.  You're here.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, live from Afghanistan.  All right, Tom, how do you lead the women and children? 
[02:21:30]  No, it's how can you shoot innocent women and children?  The answer, easy, you just don't lead them as much.  If they run, they're VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined VC.  Rather, get your boots on.  And the next time I catch you spraying skeet repellent on your f***ing feet, 
[02:22:00]  I'm going to court-martial your nigger ass.  Whoa, Tom.  You can't say that on the nightly news.  Out in the field, when death is around the corner, you say what you want.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785. 
[02:22:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  And E.W.  Oh, no, freak, no.  That's the name of the game.  That's the name of the game.  That's the name of the game.

[02:23:30]  Jackie Fine is on the line.  Jackie Fine on the line.  And she's Jackie.  Jackie.  Yeah, Jackie.  Hey.  Jackie Fine.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  Hey.  You remember talking to us about a year ago?  Oh, how could I forget?  What's up, baby?  How could I forget?  Yeah.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Yeah, baby.  Did you guys get the email that I got from one of your listeners? 
[02:24:00]  I don't know.  What did they say?  Well, you have to have Rick to show it to you.  What's up?  It was really cute.  What to say, baby?  So, what's going on?  So, how's New York?  New York's all right.  Good.  Or should I say it's right?  Good night.  It's doing okay.  Now, Jackie, remind the audience and me what your book is about.  Book, video, CD, Viacream. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, the cream.  Yes, I had the Viacream.  I forgot about the cream.  Remember the cream?  That was like the Viagra cream for the...  Hello, Jackie?  Jackie, where did Jackie go?  Jackie's phone call got knocked the end out.  What happened?  We didn't even say anything bad yet.  She hung up.  Yeah, she is.  She's back.  All right.  Jackie, fine.  She's Jackie.  Jackie!  What are you guys doing?  What happened?  No, I...  You know something?  I know.  I got to say it.  Hold on.  Let me tell you something, Jackie.  Especially our audience.  I got to... 
[02:25:00]  We might even pull crap like that sometimes.  But we got to get to the meat of a conversation before we hang up on people.  That was really something went amiss there.  I got you.  Something went a little awry.  I got you.  Now, Jackie, you were talking about your cream.  I was talking about my cream.  I was talking about my cream.  Jackie cream.  Candy.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold the phone there, Jackie.  We can't be that in-depth in our description of what this cream is.  We know what the cream is for. 
[02:25:30]  It's for the little man on the boat.  Exactly.  Yeah, let's just call him that.  The little man on the boat.  Okay.  You rub the cream on his little head.  Yeah.  And what is...  When you rub it on his little head and he gets excited.  Mm-hmm.  He starts to get wet.  Mm-hmm.  And he stands at attention.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  That's right, brother.  But if your audience doesn't, you know, don't recall who I am...  Let's just put it this way.  It turns a four into a six.  Can I give him a little bit of background information on that? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, you do that, Jackie.  Okay.  Well, for the past 14 years, I've worked with the American Institute of Human Abilities  and I'm a part of a group of sex and relationship experts that have spent the last 35 years  helping couples and individuals improve their sex life.  Yeah.  And we created a series of videos that illustrate our research for his eyes only and her eyes  only.  By the back.  Yeah.  The ultimate sexual experience.  The ultimate guide to making a relationship work.  And the one that's, you know, getting ready to come up is the ultimate Valentine. 
[02:26:30]  Keep talking.  Yes.  What we basically do is take a frozen relationship with people who are looking to keep the romance  in their relationship and support them in ways to do that.  Yes, I bet that, baby.  So now they read your book.  They see the video.  What is this going to do for somebody?  It improves their relationship.  It gives them different things that they can do.  For example, for his eyes only and her eyes only, we have 26 different sex positions that 
[02:27:00]  you can try because oftentimes people will say, you know, that they need some variety.  I know one, in and out.  In their relationship.  But all of these can be seen at JustAssJackie.com.  I'm sorry?  Jackie Fine.  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position out of 26?  He's such a chowder head.  My favorite position?  Yeah.  If I told you, I'd have to kill you.  No one's pointing to his crotch again. 
[02:27:30]  Going, look, he's sporting.  You'll let you dig in this.  I got like six and a half.  He's fooling.  He's fussing with himself.  Jackie Fine.  Why won't you tell us your favorite sexual position?  Yeah.  If I did, I'd have to kill you.  No, no, baby.  I'll tell you mine.  It's that cowgirl thing where like top and backwards thing.  Nice.  Uh-huh.  I like the way Jackie looked in her book.  I think this picture that propping that ass up looked like two fine eggplants next to each 
[02:28:00]  other.  Yeah.  Well, Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's Jackie.  Jackie.  You're a diva.  Jackie's a diva.  Are you guys looking at my website?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why we're saying she's Jackie.  I'm looking.  Hold on.  Let me take a look there, baby.  Jackie?  Let me see.  www.jackiefine.com or justassjackie?  Mm-hmm.  Justassjackie.  There she is.  Mm-hmm.  Turn around Jackie Fine so I can see how Jackie she is. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, Jackie.  Look how Jackie she is.  Yeah, baby.  That's good.  You got any junk in the trunk?  Jackie, you got some junk in the trunk?  Do you have junk in the trunk?  Me?  No.  But I like a girl with some junk in the trunk.  I like especially a fine African princess such as yourself.  I like her ass to look like about 500 pounds of chewed tootsie roll. 
[02:29:00]  And then you just spit it out and mold it into a fine man.  Get me pumping.  What's your favorite position?  Come on, Jackie.  I know you guys got to have something more interesting to ask me than my favorite sex position.  Ask Washington.  Come on.  No, we don't.  Well, you said there's 26 positions.  26.  What if we guessed it?  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Reverse cowboy?  I'm waiting.  Wait.  We'll get three guesses?  Yes.  Is that fair? 
[02:29:30]  Sure.  But you got to play along.  If we guessed it, you got to tell us.  Okay.  And then you get free plugs on the Opie and Anthony show for 18 cities.  Yeah.  Well, actually 17 and Washington.  Mm.  17 and one crime-ridden dump.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm waiting.  Now, now.  Don't take it out on them.  All right, Jackie.  I'm going to start.  Okay.  Fine black lady like yourself.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to have to go with, uh, with, uh, uh, Doggy. 
[02:30:00]  Doggy?  Yeah.  No.  Jackie is much more classic than Doggy.  Doggy with the reach around.  No.  Okay, so that's the first one.  Okay, what's the second one?  Wait, wait.  No, you guys.  Yes or not?  No, I want to hear what the other three is.  Jackie will tell you that Doggy doesn't really reach the good areas on a woman.  That's why you do the reach around.  Oh, that's not true.  Oh, sure.  It does, but let me tell you, the reach around adds the icing on the cake.  Here's my guess, Jackie.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Any position as long as he got benefits. 
[02:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.  I think that's the third one would be the good one.  Yeah, what have you done for me lately?  Wow, man.  Jackie, Jackie.  What?  We can't get, we got, we got to know the favorite, uh, position.  Then we can move on with some of this other stuff here.  That was it.  He got it. 
[02:31:00]  Come on.  Jackie, ain't nothing going on but the rent.  Yeah.  I can see Jackie taking that picture on her website and looking at it and just going,  God damn, I look good.  I got to tell you, I look good.  Mm-hmm.  You look like a classy lady.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jackie, you might be helping out a lot of people out there with your favorite sexual position.  But he guessed it.  Oh, see, you're going with the gag.  No, my favorite position, I don't particularly have it. 
[02:31:30]  I like, um, you know, a variety.  Like what?  You know, my favorite, one of my favorites would be the reach around.  Ah, yeah.  I mean, that is very good.  But then, you know, I like, you know, variety.  I like to try new things.  Yeah.  Hey, would you ever let a white guy do you?  Have you had any diversity in the races of men that you've had?  Because Opie's always scoping for a black chick.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Is he?  He ain't getting one, though.  That's a gosemous truth, too.  Well, you know what they say. 
[02:32:00]  What?  The black of the berry, the sweet of the juice.  Do they say that?  Oh.  Who's they?  Yeah.  And how much time are they serving?  Huddle-a, huddle-a.  You gave it bad.  Ain't that bad.  But you guys don't want to ask me any questions about the videos or about sex other than my sex life?  You're fat, Jackie.  I am not.  I mean, fat.  T-H-A-T.  Like I like hanging with you.  You're fat.  It's Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's... 
[02:32:30]  Jackie.  Your sexual preference is important, though, because if you're writing a book about sex,  what you're about sexually does count, not even in a perverted way, but it does mean something  if your own sexuality is satisfying.  Who cares?  This is very true.  Now, let me tell you, there is nothing more exciting to a man than a happy, turned-on woman  that he doesn't have to fix.  Wait, are you disillusioned?  That initiates lovemaking.  Yeah.  No S, Einstein.  That is very attractive to a man.  Nothing better than that reaching down for that crank, huh? 
[02:33:00]  We love it.  Hey, why does the cream work so well?  Why does it...  Mainly because of the ingredients in it.  A little Bengay or something?  No, it's L-arginine and menthol.  African Yohimbi bark?  Hey, I was almost right.  Menthol.  And one of the things that happens when a woman gets older is there's a serious drop  in her libido, and she has a problem with lubrication, and this helps in that area.  Yeah, that's hot.  Oh, no, it's not.  And then the way that it's applied is very fun, too.  Yeah, with what?  A roller? 
[02:33:30]  A fist.  What is a fist?  You rub it in right below the little man in the boat.  It takes about 5 to 15 minutes.  Sound like my jaunt ratus.  Yeah, that's good stuff, right?  So you rub it in, and, you know, something tells me you can rub in water, and it's going  to feel good.  Then she queets and tries to blow out a birthday candle.  How does it work?  It's the menthol.  No, it's not just the menthol, because, you know, the menthol isn't going to cause her  to become lubricated the way that this looks. 
[02:34:00]  Find out more.  I'm on your website.  I'm trolling this thing like crazy.  Are you?  You know, your listeners can also ask me questions up there.  You see that?  Can they ask you a question?  Well, we got one of our listeners that wants to ask you a question.  All right.  Let me go to...  We can also get specials on the videos in the Viacream up there.  You see that?  Your website says, Just Ask Jackie.  Just Ask.  If they want to...  What?  Just Ask.  That's what I said.  Just Ask Jackie.  So, we're going to have some listeners ask you a question.  Okay. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, look.  Now, your website's getting hit so much that I can't even get to all the things about  the cream.  Hey, Slim Dog said that he tried your product and it worked.  Oh, yeah?  For real.  Oh, yeah.  Slim Dog.  It's some good stuff.  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up?  How you doing there, Jackie?  Yo, listen, Norton.  Take a hint, man.  Her plugs work.  You know?  What?  Nice.  Now, yo, that cream works.  Yeah.  I've used it.  My wife and I have used it.  I wrote you, Jackie.  You sent it.  I swear about it, though.  Try it out.  I'm not playing. 
[02:35:00]  It works.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  What happened to your lady after this cream thing?  Put it like this.  Oh, it just increased.  You do less work.  That's why it works.  Oh, yeah.  You do less work when you use it.  And any excuse to do less work.  Oh, come on.  Mike, you don't try.  I didn't say nothing.  And he seems like he's not into working anyway, so, you know.  What, me?  This is perfect for him.  I'll get my frank on, baby.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:35:30]  All right, Slim Dog.  Thank you.  Can I ask Slim Dog a question, mister?  Yeah, go ahead, Norton.  When you put it on the man on the boat, did it get bigger?  Yeah, it did.  Like she said, it took a couple of minutes to work, man.  But, you know, when you're downtown, after a while you notice she's reacting a little more than what you usually do.  Exactly.  And like I'm saying, it does work.  Your frequency increases, you know.  You don't have to beg as much.  Dude, it works.  So, what percentage do you think that it cut the begging down to? 
[02:36:00]  I'd say at least 35, yeah.  Wow.  At least 35%.  Wow.  You know.  Wow.  Nice.  Man, Jack, you're fine.  Nice.  Thanks, Slim Dog.  All right, now.  Hey, you guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Slim Dog, can I maybe borrow some of that cream?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Damn.  Yeah, I'll tell you what.  I'll come down to the studio and drop you all off some tomorrow if you want.  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  All right, Slim. 
[02:36:30]  Later.  Later.  So, Jackie, are we pushing the cream today or the book?  What are we doing?  Or the videos.  Well, your listeners will get a special.  If they order the videos, they get the cream.  But the videos are boring.  All right.  Are you kidding?  You've got the couples doing it in your videos?  Yes.  There's 26 different positions.  Are you kidding?  That stuff is hot.  Hey, where'd you get that videotape?  I got it from a Negro.  I'm going to send you guys both videos.  I bet you couldn't either. 
[02:37:00]  And I want you to tell me if you can see the difference in the beginning of the first one  and the beginning of the second one.  Oh.  How about that?  I bet you can't even name all the 26 positions.  And I'd be willing to bet you, Anthony, you're going to spot it.  Yeah.  It's something very different.  Do they show close-ups?  Yes, they do.  Is it hardcore?  It's not hardcore.  It's educational.  Well, there's an enlarged view of the female reproduction area.  Oh, is there?  That's all I need.  It's showing you how to touch, where to touch, in order to give you the most intense pleasure 
[02:37:30]  in your partner.  Do they show the man the boat?  Yes, they do.  Nice.  Any bukkake?  Bukkake.  I'll tell you one complaint that we got.  We got this 70-year-old guy who ordered the video.  And he was upset because he says, I can't do that stuff.  That's gymnastics.  Oh.  Yeah.  He was very upset.  Yeah.  Look at you with the jokes. 
[02:38:00]  Because you'll laugh and tell him to have a stroke.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, Jackie Fine.  Jackie Fine, your website's getting pounded right now.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, they probably want to call the 800 number.  Can I give it up?  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  The 800.  1-800-622-8454.  Can I put that on?  Can I call that on my calling card? 
[02:38:30]  That's 1-800-622-8454.  Yes, you can call it on your calling card.  Anything else you want to get out today there, Jackie Fine?  Well, I'd love to see you guys when I come to New York.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I am dying to meet you in person.  That's what I'm talking about.  Can people order your products, Jackie, from eatabullet.com?  I'm sorry?  Oh, Norton.  Norton's plugging his own website like the whore he is.  He's such a plug whore. 
[02:39:00]  Wait, someone else has a question now, Anthony.  Let me, uh...  Yeah?  Hold on a second here.  Let me do this, then go over here.  And then if I go over here...  You're, uh, digital.  Uh, Adam, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to know.  If it doesn't work down below, can you use that stuff for Afro-Sheen later on?  Oh, stop it.  Afro-Sheen.  Remember Afro-Sheen?  Because I used to watch Soul Train, and that was one of the sponsors.  Thank God, uh, black folk figured out a better way to do stuff with their hair than that Afro-Sheen. 
[02:39:30]  And Jerry Curl.  Remember the oil slick that would leave?  Yep.  Well, Jiminy Cricket.  Or Chunk.  Well, no, you can't use it for Afro-Shave.  No.  Mmm.  I bet Jackie's completely shaved, right?  Yeah, right?  Uh-huh, that's what I'm talking about.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Man, you have the hottest voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I am dying to be in studio with you, Anthony.  Oh, I bet.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, you're shaved down there.  Look like Lou Gossett Jr., right?  I betcha.  Look like Lou Gossett Jr. with a hatchet to the head.  With a black eye.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  I'll show you some mayonnaise.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Well, see, the wonderful thing about it is that, you know, women who don't even have a problem 
[02:40:30]  orgasming, having orgasms.  Or an orgasming.  You can use the cream because it has a more of a major impact on their orgasmic experience.  So, you know.  There's no color on it, though.  It doesn't matter if you're light or dark-skinned, right?  No.  It's clear.  It's not going to look goofy down there, right?  And it's all natural.  Put it on.  Look like a beaver with rabies.  It's not all foamy or nothing.  But when I send you guys the videos, you're going to watch them and tell me the difference, right? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, we'll get you back on the phone and we'll give you a...  Are you in these...  Are you in the videos, Jackie?  Yes, I am.  You are.  Naked?  Sold.  Are you naked or are you just sitting there explaining what's going on?  Oh, baby.  Tell me Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Are you kidding?  You told me to tell you that Jackie Fine...  You'd be a tease, baby.  You're there just with the pointer.  No pointer. 
[02:41:30]  She's hot sitting there with clothes on and Estorol is demonstrating.  I don't think Jackie needs her cream today.  Yeah.  I'm big dick black.  Yeah.  Okie dokie.  Any more callers?  Well, we're protecting you today, Jackie.  Yeah, we're kind of feeling it.  Because you're Jackie.  I'm kind of feeling it with you.  Oh, so you're going to be nicer this time.  Yeah.  I want to be with you. 
[02:42:00]  We don't want to be predictable.  Yeah, exactly.  Just when you think the people have us figured out.  We turn it around.  We flip it.  What would you rather hear a guy say to you?  I love you.  I want to make love to you.  Or I take care of my kids.  Or I take care of my kids.  Rhetorical question.  Never mind.  All right there, Miss Jackie Fine.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  You know, my birthday is the day before Valentine's.  Ooh.  Ooh.  How old are you going to be on your birthday?  I'll never tell.  Ooh, no, huh?  Let me take a look at her picture.  Close.  I can't.  The website's being pounded.  I can't even get on it.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Can I guess your age when you come in here?  Sure.  Uh-oh.  You know how Opie guesses girls' ages?  How?  He's got to look at their taint.  You know what the taint is, right?  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  I'm five for five, Jackie Fine. 
[02:43:00]  Five for five.  What do you think?  Maybe I won't let you guess my age.  He got to gaze into the forbidden zone.  So has that worked for you, Opie?  Yeah.  Every time.  Five times.  Five for five.  He's five for five, guessing girls' ages.  Oh, my goodness.  Just by looking at the taint.  Man.  Yeah, Jackie.  He's got skills, huh?  He got the skills.  Yeah.  Kids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My lady love. 
[02:43:30]  You know, it's amazing that you guys get paid to do this.  Don't tell anyone.  This week.  They're on to us in Washington.  I don't know.  The whole community says they aren't on to us.  They're on to us.  Yeah.  Let's hear it for Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Yeah, baby.  Good job, Jackie Fine.  Thank you.  Come see us soon and send those videos, all right?  I will.  I'll send them out to you today.  All right.  There she goes.  Jackie Fine.  Bye, Jackie.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Jackie.  Bye-bye. 
[02:44:00]  I like pouring out Mrs. Butterworth.  Get her ass up in the air.  Pouring that syrup out.  I like mine with syrup.  See that nice, calmly brown ass just turn clear?  As you're pouring out the syrup. 
[02:44:30]  The syrup.  The syrup.  Yeah.  And with that, we'll be back right in.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Afternoon radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  Opie and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, darn it.  And E-W. 
[02:45:00]  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know you want this time.  I know you know, you know, you know.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  Eight, seven, seven, six, nine, two, one, oh, two, seven.  Anywhere else, including Boston.  Boston.  We're just tuning in.  We got great news from Boston. 
[02:45:30]  We did real well in the ratings up there in Boston.  We're more gooder this time around.  I want to thank everyone up there.  More gooder.  We're supporting the show.  Rich Voss is in the studio.  Voss, what's up, man?  He looks like a proud pop-up.  I'm not a proud pop-up.  Because he's introducing Patrice to Aunt Nye and our listeners.  Patrice is a really funny guy, man.  I met Patrice a few times there at Caroline's.  Probably one of the funniest comics out there. 
[02:46:00]  He's a creep as a human.  Is he funnier than you?  Yes.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody who hasn't seen me and seen Voss.  They know I'm funny.  I like when Voss is plowing through the same old crap.  It's awful, isn't it?  He's wrong, right?  Lenny Bruce got more new jokes.  And he sells a CD with the same material that he said. 
[02:46:30]  Voss won't, even his improvs is, Voss improvs yesterday's stuff.  I came up with a couple of new bits.  Go ahead, say one.  Give us one of your new bits.  I don't know.  Let me think about, oh, here's a new one who really gets on my nerves.  Jared from Subway.  I hope he gains all his weight back, right?  In the text, when I'm doing it on stage, he lost 300 pounds eating subs.  I go, what was he eating before that? 
[02:47:00]  Can you tell that he's making this?  He wrote this down.  I don't want to expose Voss.  Listen, I don't want to stop people from eating.  Rich Voss has made that up yesterday.  He wrote it down.  He's trying it here.  No, I'm not.  What he's going to end up doing is...  Basically, hey, everybody.  Why should I go white?  What?  What?  It's a new job. 
[02:47:30]  He wants to go black.  He'll never go back home.  What?  Oh.  What?  It's new.  It's a new job.  Buy my CD.  Listen.  You're doing it.  Buy a...  Is Jared even doing those commercials anymore?  Oh, yeah.  They show up.  I haven't seen...  Listen, Rich Voss always comes up with new stuff all the time.  Hey, now, Mary.  Did you see me the other night perform?  Oh, they set her up. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah?  No.  You were wonderful.  Well, how funny was that?  You were very funny, and he got me dinner, too.  Oh.  See that?  He didn't pay for it, but he got it for me.  Yeah.  I hooked you up, right?  Yes.  With a salad?  Yes, you did.  All right.  We're done with you.  Call.  What do you think of our new furniture outside the studio?  That's nice.  We're jazzing up the place.  Yeah.  What's that?  The vinyl or whatever sort of spoo slides off it?  What is that crap out there?  I don't know.  It's like the furniture that they brought in.  It looks like Greg Brady's attic bedroom now. 
[02:48:30]  It's groovy.  Don't you feel like you're on the real world set or something?  No, I wouldn't put that in a summer beach house.  It's really ugly.  It really is.  I like the old stained stuff that was in here, because you know, at least when I talk, I'm  going to slobber, and I'm not going to feel guilty.  That stuff is horrible.  Who picked it out?  Patrice is just shaking his head out.  Patrice is like, you're saying nothing.  It's what I'm just talking about.  If you see these guys down at Caroline's, Voss will be up there.  He'll be doing his act, and Patrice is sitting by the kitchen door, kind of pretty far away, 
[02:49:00]  just mocking Voss the whole time.  It's awful.  No, he's sitting by the kitchen door waiting for food.  I'm fat, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a fat joke.  Fat.  People can't see on the radio, Voss, but I'm a fat guy.  You are a buffet molester.  You're not fat.  Jesus Christ.  You're fat.  Stop insulting me.  It's the year 2006, Rich.  His jokes are old.  His car is old.  Yeah, I heard about this car.  I drove in his car.  He's making payments on an 89 machine. 
[02:49:30]  Wait, but here's the thing.  You're making payments?  He's got the janitors, like the rich janitor, bins.  It's not even like, it's the bins they make for people that just, but that's Voss.  You ever see him?  Voss, your shirt's dirty.  It's DKNY.  Voss, but it's filthy.  I can't even fight that.  I can't even. 
[02:50:00]  What is DKNY?  Voss, this car stinks.  It's 1982.  You're trying.  It's a machine.  It's a machine.  You're paying for this?  You're making payments?  Yeah.  Did he tell you he's making payments?  Wait, wait.  Did I tell you what the number was?  Did I tell you what the number was?  No, it is a 190E.  Yeah, it's a 190E.  Look, it's a clean-looking Mercedes.  It's a...  Nobody has a 190E. 
[02:50:30]  190E, I never even heard of that.  You're a big black man.  You're driving a Cadillac.  I'm supposed to.  You're a Jew.  You're driving a Mercedes.  That's only because you're driving a Nazi car, not even a good one.  You're driving a bad Nazi car.  You suck.  Oh, man.  Here's what Rich bought.  This is what he thought.  This is what he thought when it came up here.  Just real quick.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to hog this.  No, hell not.  This is what he thought.  Yeah.  He says, he's thinking, I'm just... 
[02:51:00]  Enough with a slobbering.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Some people distinguish.  She's talking about you instead of just talking.  This is what he thought.  He thought, hey, I'm...  Because him and Norton, for some reason, they think they're good fellas now.  For some reason.  They want to pay for meals now.  They point at you when they talk.  Hey, hey.  Oh, really?  Everybody's Italian, even at Chinese restaurants.  Hey.  Oh, hey there.  Hi there.  And this is what he thought.  He thinks he's a made man.  He's going to bring me up to Opie and Anthony's show and make a complete jackass out of me.  Because he's a regular guest. 
[02:51:30]  He's like, come on in, everybody.  Hey, Patrick, this is a pinball machine that's broke.  Hey, secretaries.  Hey, everybody.  Like he's bringing me through the back entrance.  And the good fella's like...  He thinks he's Ray Liot now.  He sucks.  He's using you just to get air time.  You know that, right?  That's what he does right there.  Because we would never have him on Facebook.  Did he tell you he is a regular guest?  The regular guest, though, that everyone goofs on.  He stinks. 
[02:52:00]  This is what he thought.  He said, okay, I'm going to bring on some new guy.  But you didn't realize they can't see fat over the radio at all.  But they can hear...  Voss, you notice how you were whisked right into the studio as soon as you got here?  Yeah.  I have to get it back.  Think about it.  Oh, okay.  Voss killed when he has something to goof on in this studio.  No, listen.  I never fail for you guys.  We're all team players.  I didn't bring up here thinking, hey, I'm going to crack on you.  I don't care about you.  No, I didn't.  What am I going to say possibly about you?  No.  You absolutely did, Voss.  I don't like how you try to use me like I'm the new kid at Reese's. 
[02:52:30]  No.  Not at all.  They call me and say, you know, whatever.  We've been trying to get you on the show for a while.  That is the truth.  Listen, if your phone was turned on and they could have called you, then you would have  known that.  There you go.  Black people's phones ain't turned on.  No, yours are.  Yours isn't, okay?  See, and whenever I come back to you, you're going to go, oh, the whole black people thing,  you know?  It's you.  You.  It has nothing to do with black people.  Do you like his black humor there, Patrice?  It's, I mean, yeah.  The wallet joke and the fried chicken, the coochie fried. 
[02:53:00]  Every black comic on earth talks about white people.  Not really.  I don't.  Who?  Yes, you do.  You don't talk about white people?  No.  No?  Say one.  I can say about ten of them.  Say one.  When I'm walking down the street, some white lady's walking at me and I'm thinking, you  know, or I'm scared.  That's reflective on me.  You're talking about white people.  On what I think.  Right.  I'm not saying white people's phones work, black people's don't.  Well, I'm generalizing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you saying?  Okay.  White people.  White people.  No, you don't do that, Jeff. 
[02:53:30]  White people talk like, oh, man.  White people.  What?  White ladies fall at the monster movie.  That's what I do.  No, you don't do that.  Are you going to lie?  You don't do that like white people are crazy.  White people pay taxes.  I said I get nervous.  White people support their kids.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  Well, I don't remember what I do because I'm moving on to new material.  They get up early for work, white people.  They're crazy.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  White people, they're crazy.  They see their kids once or twice a year.  No, see, you do the regular stuff about white people.  White people crazy. 
[02:54:00]  That's not me.  They got bank accounts.  Now he's making up stuff.  White people crazy.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's not on his CD.  They like girls with small asses.  All that stuff is not on his CD.  Stop using me as a black guinea pig.  I don't like that.  I'm not.  I'm just saying.  You talk about white people.  Voss, say one of my jokes.  I try not to remember your act.  Say one of my jokes.  Listen, you do the one about if a white lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it. 
[02:54:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's very funny, by the way.  It is funny.  It's very funny.  Yes.  How about if a lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it?  Why does it have to be a white lady?  Of course, if a white lady is killed in real life, you're going to look at black people.  Because it's funny when I say white lady, Voss.  But it's funny when I say black people.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It is.  They feel bad for you, Rich.  No.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Wait.  Wait.  When we're doing...  Okay.  Here's the deal.  22 years in the business.  Listen to me.  A room full of all black... 
[02:55:00]  A room full of all black comics.  Yeah.  I mean, all black audience.  Yeah.  Right?  You're on stage, Armand.  Who's going to do better?  Me.  Yeah?  Let's get your old Apollo tape.  A room full of...  Let's get your Apollo tape.  I got booed.  Once you got booed 17 times, then you think black people love you.  No.  No.  They hate you like white people, like Jews.  No one likes you.  What happened at the Apollo?  I got booed right off of it.  How did that happen?  You got booed at the Apollo?  I came out there nice and arrogant.  You know what you...  I didn't come out there.  What's up?  What's up?  I like the one up there where, yo... 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, Apollo.  I expected the same reaction out of getting Caroline's.  Nothing.  You know what you got to come out with for the Apollo?  You come out in an Asian guy mask, and they will love you.  I have seen...  I've watched every goddamn episode of Showtime at the Apollo, and they love...  When the Asian, like, they could do 80s breakdancing.  They could do 80s breakdancing.  They got like...  And we got this Japanese troupe over there.  Don't speak a word of English.  They go, oh, oh.  And the music starts.  The whole crowd goes, wow!  They go crazy. 
[02:56:00]  And if they sing gospel, that's even the album.  Oh, yeah.  A Chinese guy singing gospel on the Apollo.  Oh, yeah.  Forget it.  He's 20 weeks in a row.  He's winning.  I got booed right off.  Really?  Too arrogant, you think?  Yeah, I came out nice and...  Like I was funny.  Yeah.  I got a big, fat lesson.  They're not going to show it, though, because I curse.  I may show up.  You got to show up.  I never made it.  Show this.  That's smart.  Yeah, it is.  Hey, Elisa from Cleveland has a problem today.  Elisa, what's up? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, bummer.  It says, on her period but wants sex, even just oral, boyfriend won't what to do, what  to do.  Elisa, we lose you?  No.  So, now, you're having your time, is that okay, and your boyfriend doesn't touch you  when you're doing this?  Yeah, I don't know what his time is.  He doesn't want to get freaky or anything.  You know, it's like, I'm on my rag, and I've been on my rag for months.  See, I started taking my birth control.  Maybe it's the way you put it.  No.  Okay, look.  Well, hey.  I'm on my rag.  For months, maybe you're...  Hey, rag, same thing. 
[02:57:00]  And see, I haven't had any sex because he doesn't want to do anything, and it's pissing me  off.  He doesn't want to do anything.  And I'm a freak like that, and I like to...  So, he's not into the crime scene sex.  Crime scene sex is perfectly acceptable.  Just do it on...  You guys into the crime scene sex?  Darker sheets.  No, no.  You don't do that?  No?  I don't mind committing a crime against sex, but I'm not into...  You won't...  I make my girl sleep on the floor when she's on a period.  Really?  What?  I don't even touch her.  Nasty.  Stinking.  Pretty ugly. 
[02:57:30]  Now it's bleeding.  You should be willing to touch her no matter what.  That's your girl.  Wow.  She only bleeds for four days on the floor.  Okay, I'm not asking you to do something every night.  A month of bleeding from that mess.  I don't even know if that made the error.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  God damn.  Yeah, I don't...  You know something?  I got no problem.  The guy should have...  He should dive right in there.  Yeah, there's no gray area with that one, man.  Screw it.  You're either into it or not.  Yeah.  What should I say to him? 
[02:58:00]  Say F me or I'll find someone that will.  I'll get him going.  It's not blood.  I can't do that.  I've been with this guy for like two years.  It's all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, it's eggs and...  It's like a puree.  And it's cleansing.  If he was just bleeding like it was a wound, it would be different.  Yeah, but I'm saying, see, and I'm almost off and it's not even all that bad anymore.  So what is it, Jay?  It's like it's almost done and he still won't do anything.  It's been like two weeks since he's touched me and it's like...  Maybe he just doesn't want to have sex with you.  What do you...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:58:30]  What's that language?  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah, yeah.  Long, blonde hair.  Yeah, how do you...  Two eyes.  Yeah?  What else do you want to know?  On a one to ten, what are you?  Huh?  On a one to ten scale, what are you?  And you've got to be an eight.  On a personal opinion?  Yeah.  No, from the guy down the block.  Yeah, personal opinion.  I'll give myself an eight.  I'll be in Cleveland next week.  Well, if it's, like Patrice said, if it looked like a regular wound blood, if it's like, what, 
[02:59:00]  like ragu marinara, you don't want to...  No?  Nothing even near there?  If it was that bad, I wouldn't ask him to do anything.  It looks like cacciatore.  Chunks of peppers and onions.  All that fun stuff also.  Sure.  Looks like salsa.  Well, maybe he's got a point now that I think about it.  All right, Elizabeth.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  We can't help you today.  You're either into it or not. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Thanks anyway, you guys.  All right.  Big Al, you no-get period for a month.  She's dying.  He's making a quick diagnosis.  She's dying.  She's dying.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, hey, boss.  What's up?  And the words from Jim Norton, you stink.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:00:00]  And welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're having a lot of fun today.  Yeah, we got to do the frigging Cribs with her.  Oh, definitely.  I'll show you a good, uh, I'll do a good episode of Cribs for you.  Oh, good, uh, I'll do a good episode of Cribs for you.  Oh, oh, hi.  You caught me by surprise.  I'm barely dressed.  But come in.  Welcome to my crib. 
[03:00:30]  Step inside.  It's not too big.  Small room.  Here's my bedroom, which is the whole room.  And, uh, you know, I sleep here and I like to entertain, but I never have no one to entertain.  But if I did, they'd, it would take place in here.  Here's the window I stare out of for hours on end, plundering, jumping. 
[03:01:00]  Come here.  I'd like to show you my ride.  This is how I travel.  No, I'm not taking to the garage.  This is the table.  It's my metro card on the table right here.  It's my ride.  How are they?  I like to affectionately refer to my place as party land.  Here's what I do my cooking and whatnot.  It's called a hot plate. 
[03:01:30]  I just put my cans of, you know, every various thing.  Here's my stacks of, uh, three Campbell's soups.  And some chips and Chef Boyardee.  I just, if you notice, my cabin, it's a fuller ship.  Oh, I got one left.  And my payday's nut till next week, so I'm a little strapped.  Here's where I relax and unwind.  If you notice, we're still in the same room. 
[03:02:00]  It's my 15-inch black and white Zenith TV.  It's fabulous.  Can't know if you're Chrissy, but I got some high C in a Flintstones jelly jar.  I had it for when I was a kid.  Yep, well, here we are.  This is where the magic happens. 
[03:02:30]  This is where I get my F on.  Yeah.  If I had an F to get in.  Man, there's always a book and a piece of art, Anthony.  Well, right now I'm reading this.  It's D-A-E-N-E-T-X.  Hoping it improves my life.  But I did it.  A little artwork, maybe?  Poster?  I drew this myself.  With magic meekers.  And I decorated the frame with macaroni shells, Pam. 
[03:03:00]  You painted gold.  Well, can I interest you in some McDonald's I took home?  Dinner time.  You guys must be hungry.  Share some French fries.  They're not that old.  They let me take home the old French fries as much as I want.  They're not quite fresh, but they're not quite like the French fry sticks you find between your seats in the cure.  Here's my big water cooler jug full of change, but it's empty.  If you were here last week, you'd see like maybe 450 and quarters in there, but I had to eat. 
[03:03:30]  A nigger got to eat.  Yo, B.  Here's where I'd just cry for hours on end thinking about my miserable life.  Okay, enough of you, MTV.  I've got to get on with my miserable life.  Out.  Bye-bye. 
[03:04:00]  Out, out, out.  There you go.  I'm throwing you out.  Get out.  Here's the hallways.  Look, as you're leaving, I'll show you the hallway to the bathroom I have to use.  It's down the hill.  I share it with a rummy, a priestitute.  They steal my underwear.  That's right.  Good call, Matt.  They stole our underwear.  They stole our underwear because she shares the bathroom with a bunch of freaks. 
[03:04:30]  I forgot about that.  Oh, man.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty.  Cribs with Stalker Patty. </pre>
