<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving Anthony's computer, resolved by a tech person named "Mars" using a secret code.  The hosts then engaged in their usual nonsensical banter, discussing the day of the week, their upcoming Las Vegas trip for CES, listener emails, and the difficulties of finding old audio tapes of the radio character "Spuds Buckley."  Jim Norton was present in the studio throughout a large portion of the show.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to crude and graphic discussions about encounters with naked men in various public locations, featuring numerous listener calls with similar experiences.  This was interspersed with calls from Chris (Missouri) seeking marriage advice (which devolved into crude commentary about engagement rings and the possibility of children with Down syndrome) and Brian (Tennessee), a long-time listener.

The show promoted their year-end special, "Opie and Anthony's bonus bits," and a listener-suggested "Guess What's in My Pants" segment via Paltalk webcam, which later occurred with a caller named Cara, resulting in sexually explicit commentary.  A discussion regarding the quality of sound effects, particularly "fake footsteps" in a promo, led to Steve, a sound effects technician, joining the show to explain his work.  Other audio promos were critiqued, some described as "misogynistic" and "women hating."  The hosts reviewed the movie *King Kong*,  with detailed descriptions and criticism of Jack Black's performance.  Anthony recounted a movie theater experience involving disruptive children and their subsequent ejection, using the phrase "on behalf of the theater."

The show included discussions of news stories, notably the incident of a ground worker puncturing a plane's fuselage and the arrest of former baseball player Jeff Reardon for allegedly robbing a jewelry store.  Speculation on Reardon's mental state and motivations ensued.  The hosts also discussed and played a Tenacious D song with vulgar lyrics.  Bill Burr was mentioned as an upcoming guest and later appeared in the studio, though a last-minute scheduling conflict for a New Year's Eve gig in Livonia, Michigan caused brief chaos.

A substantial portion of the show focused on speculation about Dick Clark's health after a stroke, based on a possibly doctored publicity photo, accompanied by vulgar jokes.  The hosts played and reacted to audio of Club Soda Kenny's highly offensive stand-up routine, filled with graphic sexual content, rape jokes, and pedophilia jokes, along with Bill Burr's commentary and numerous listener calls.

A "year in review" segment for 2005 covered pop culture, including the iPod Nano, Xbox 360, Britney Spears' pregnancy, Michael Jackson's court appearance, *Star Wars: Episode III*, *Brokeback Mountain*, and a scathing critique of the *Pink Panther* remake, filled with profanity.  The hosts mocked various aspects of a Barbara Walters "Top Ten Fascinating People" segment, particularly Kanye West and Dakota Fanning, and expressed their disdain for AFTRA.  Further offensive commentary targeted Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise, and Gary Glitter. A call from Esty of the Comedy Cellar briefly interrupted this segment.

Finally, the show extensively covered the child molestation charges against Gary Glitter in Vietnam, including allegations of child rape, the possibility of the death penalty, and accusations of Glitter paying off a family.  The hosts made numerous crude and offensive jokes about the case and child sex tourism, along with unrelated sexually explicit comments from the hosts and callers.  Bill Burkensit was mentioned as a potential guest for a New Year's Eve event.  The show concluded with discussions of the show's crew, a list of late-night monologue targets, the death of the "Sleepy Donut Guy," and a humorous anecdote about Dick Clark's New Year's Eve broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Where do they turn when they're in despair? 
[00:03:30]  O&A Body Rock!  It's showtime, folks!  It feels good.  It's cool.  We're a brilliant broadcaster.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Very respectful.  Very nice.  There is some shenanigans going on.  And it just feels right.  They're like two puggles.  We want perfect questions.  We want some laughs.  Hey, hey.  Some thoughts being provoked and thrown back and forth.  I don't like flaky.  I like cakey.  I want to hug a cute dog.  How fake was that? 
[00:04:00]  The name of this radio show should be the happy idiot and the sullen douche.  Two total dorks.  Am I listening to a radio show?  Two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program is about, mister.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Go boys.  What's happening, man?  On your fucking radio show!  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  It's lovely.  Come on.  We're going to tell you how to get shit.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm a horribly boring person.  We're just kind of laugh at him. 
[00:04:30]  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in still.  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  I love B-rocking with the consulate.  Snapple and Mayo, your thumbs must be lovely.  He's featuring...  Hurricane Ben!  Martini Steve!  I think there's a degree of an echo illness with everybody on the show.  Ramone!  Ramone!  Ramone!  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  I got a few ideas.  I could get it fired. 
[00:05:00]  Please use them.  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Fish in the hole!  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  This calls for the old Billy Baroo.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, good to be. 
[00:05:30]  It's a biggie.  All right, never mind.  I don't need that.  I don't need that computer.  As a matter of fact, I don't think anybody will need it once I throw something through the monitor.  You don't have it in you.  That's what...  You don't have it in you.  That's what it is with the computers over here.  One day they work, they're fine.  The next day, they don't work.  And they're not fine. 
[00:06:00]  And who knows?  What's the problem?  What's the problem, man?  I can't get into the instant feedback computer.  I can't even get onto that computer.  Maybe the listeners banned you.  Maybe I've been banned.  Maybe they banned you.  That would suck.  I tried logging in.  Everybody else has tried logging in using their passwords and names.  And no, nothing.  So that computer is done.  I'm not even going to pay attention to it anymore.  Everyone is taking a peek. 
[00:06:30]  I love this.  And I know what Danny's going to do.  He's going to go, go to this option and look for...  Oh, look, it only says Dillette or D plus client one.  Yes, you got another...  All right, I'd be happy to step aside.  Everybody, that's Mars.  For those of you watching on PalTalk, he is now typing away.  This is a great way to start the show.  This is beautiful.  Trying to get my instant feedback computer going. 
[00:07:00]  Mars, you have to enter.  Okay.  I'm trying to help.  Shut up.  I'm trying to be helpful.  I'm good at this stuff.  No, you're not.  You're horrid and never helpful.  Do you know what I do when something like this happens?  I just turn it off and I try to restart the whole thing.  That usually works.  That's what I do.  The system cannot log you on because the domain Dillette is not available.  Ah, there's domains that aren't available.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  Oh, well.  Ah, just...  Ah. 
[00:07:30]  This is wonderful.  This is how you start a radio show.  Watch a guy type.  He's good at it, though.  There we go.  How'd you do that, Mars?  Watch a guy type.  What'd you put in?  I can't tell you.  What was it?  What?  You just...  Secret code?  You just entered secret code to get Anthony's computer up and running?  That's correct.  That's correct.  Look at that.  Whatever works.  We're too stupid to understand what he just did.  Much too stupider.  We needed the tech guy.  Tech guy.  Tech guy.  We're stupid. 
[00:08:00]  I'm really stupid.  I don't...  I love tech guys that just know they're so far ahead of you that they're like, don't even  bother asking.  I'm not telling you.  I'm not wasting your time, and I'm certainly not wasting my time.  You know, guys, this whole thing's going to blow past.  We're going to look back on this someday and laugh.  I'm not saying the thing wouldn't start.  We're going to go, ah, we're going to go back.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It happens, right?  There it is.  All...  We got it.  All set to go?  All set to broadcast? 
[00:08:30]  It's all there.  I'm seeing a different format on this.  It's a little big, but I'll deal with it.  You're going to do all right with that.  I'll deal with that.  It gives me a bigger band button.  Hi.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  How are you?  We're all doing well.  This is XM Satellite Radio.  Yes, it is.  And this is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Slowly but surely.  Yes.  Getting more gooder every day.  And it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, I believe, right?  Is it already Wednesday? 
[00:09:00]  How did that happen?  Let's see.  We had Monday off.  So yesterday was Monday.  Yeah.  So today should be Tuesday.  You do that.  But now it's Wednesday.  So now we jumped ahead.  And tomorrow's Friday.  Yeah.  Tomorrow would be like a Friday.  So today's like a Thursday.  Yeah.  But it's Wednesday.  Yeah.  But tomorrow's definitely Friday for us.  Oh, yeah.  It's a Friday show because Friday ain't coming in.  Friday's like a Saturday.  Is it?  Yeah.  We got two Saturdays.  Two Saturdays this week?  Two Saturdays this week and one Sunday. 
[00:09:30]  Love two Saturdays.  We should have two Sundays.  Two Sundays?  We're working on that as well.  Oh, are we horrible?  It's horrible.  The more time we could get off, the better.  The better we're going to be at broadcasting.  Awful.  Well, we got Vegas next week.  Vegas, yes.  CES.  I know that.  You're going to be in the Vegas area and you're going to be close to CES.  I don't even know if you're allowed in.  I don't know.  Isn't it like a...  It's like...  I don't know what it is.  Only insiders are allowed in.  And the press.  Like trade people? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Because I know there are a lot of people on MySpace that have been sending emails and stuff,  messages, saying that they're going to be in Vegas.  They want to hook up with us.  Some listeners want to hook up, play some cards.  Whether they get in to the CES or not, they want to hang out and play a little cards.  Little cards.  Yeah.  Where are we going to be this year?  Vegas.  MGM again?  Um, well, maybe, maybe not.  All depends on what names they're putting us under.  I think Venetian, actually.  To be honest with you, if it means anything. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Venetian.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Look at everyone panicking.  Panicking.  Because we're just like the Beatles.  They're going to be hiding in our showers when we go in our room.  You know, no one has to hide in the shower.  All they have to do is dial a few numbers to fuck my night up.  That's all I'm saying.  C-U-M-I-A?  Who the hell couldn't spell coma?  You suck, Jim Norton.  Oh, they're just going to be pounding down the door while we're in Vegas.  It's going to be some convention guy named Norton. 
[00:11:00]  What?  No, I don't like hookers with dicks.  Why are you calling me?  But hey, that implies that, hey, wait a minute.  Hey, hold on now.  I don't care for that.  You.  Hey, someone needs some marriage advice.  We love giving out marriage advice.  Scott's Modesto.  You're on the line.  Hey, you should be the one giving me advice.  Marriage advice.  This is Howie from New York.  No, it's actually Chris from Missouri.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hi.  I just wanted to ask Anthony on some marriage advice. 
[00:11:30]  Of course, sir.  I'm thinking I'm getting married soon.  Rumor has it you're drunk there, Chris.  Well, you know, rumors.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah, I am drunk.  So what do you want to know there, Chris?  I just want to know, like, you know, if Anthony got some advice.  Like, I'm going to buy a ring.  I don't know what I should spend.  From $300,000 to $5,000, what's the range?  $300,000, if that's your absolute minimum.  No, I don't know.  Dude, how long have you been going out with a girl? 
[00:12:00]  Four.  Four years.  Four years.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you both in love with each other?  You can call it love.  All right.  This is just a disaster in the making.  Because even if you're deeply in love, marriage just ain't it.  It's not.  It's a bad thing to do.  You're entering an agreement that is completely against you, sir.  Yeah, but, you know, it's like it's either marriage or she's going to, you know. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, she gave you an ultimatum.  No, no, she didn't give me an ultimatum, but it's like, you know, I want to kind of get, you know, on a marriage thing and then, you know, have a couple of kids and stuff like that.  See, he's just like I was.  He's thinking that the marriage is going to propel you into this different segment of your life, more into adulthood.  How old a guy are you?  I'm 31.  You're 31.  So you're at that age.  See, he's like the same age I was at.  He's like at that age where you still feel like a kid. 
[00:13:00]  You're kind of maybe acting like a kid.  Mm-hmm.  And you don't have a career like you see some people maybe should.  No, no, my career is cool.  Yeah?  Decent money.  You know, I just moved from Jersey, so.  Chris, here's.  I used to know you guys from NEW, so.  Yeah.  Chris, here's the deal.  It's cool.  It's very simple.  Do you have any doubt in your mind?  The doubt in my mind is just from shit I've seen happen.  Uh-huh.  Like, you know, Anthony's marriage hasn't been what you call a. . . 
[00:13:30]  Oh, it was a disaster, my friend.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really hasn't been.  I say. . .  To show people.  Don't do it.  I don't know how you call these things off, though.  How long have you been engaged?  Oh, we haven't been. . .  I'm about to buy a ring. . .  Oh, okay.  No.  Then don't do it.  Don't do it.  We get calls from people that say, you know, I'm getting married.  You know, the wedding is in two months or something.  And for the life of me, I don't know how you get out of those things.  I could not bring myself to walk up to somebody and go, hey, it's off, man. 
[00:14:00]  You know, the family, all that shit.  It seemed less painful to me to just get married and then get a divorce.  But, obviously, I was wrong.  Like, I couldn't imagine having to deal with family and everything and saying, no, it's off.  Wouldn't it be just better to cut off your arm and deal with that family shit?  Yes.  But, see, you're not even engaged yet.  So, my friend, don't do it.  Don't buy the ring.  Call me crazy.  Call me crazy, but if you're calling a. . .  There is such a thing as love. 
[00:14:30]  Call me crazy, but if you. . .  Ah, you're going to stop.  I'm going to lose my fucking mind, man.  He won't stop.  He's drunk.  Holy shit.  Go ahead, sir.  You're making a good point.  Go ahead, make the point.  I just wanted to say, Jimmy, no.  I hope you have the most miserable fucking marriage ever.  Tell this fucking guy to get married.  Ah, sir.  Tell him to get fucking married.  Hope thinks you might want to get married.  Well, Hope is a smart guy.  All right, then.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Get married, my friend.  You said thank you.  All right, bro. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, sir, don't go yet.  You're not finished.  No.  Please.  Leave.  I think the thing you should do.  Here's how you get out of it.  If you already do it.  You guys are missing the obvious.  First of all, I just want to call Hope crazy.  Why?  Because he asked three times to call him crazy.  Oh.  Never got out what he was going to say.  He just said, call me crazy three times and then was interrupted by this motherfucker.  It's not like he was going to go into a Broadway musical song, though.  Call me crazy.  All right.  Call me crazy.  Not only do I hope you get married, I hope you have Down syndrome kids. 
[00:15:30]  That'll be fun.  And not just one.  Like, you had the one and go, ah.  What's the odds it'll happen twice?  Never.  It just doesn't.  Have you ever seen two in one family?  Especially eight years apart.  No.  Oh.  You think it wore off or something and then there it is.  Yeah, you figured out another blood, like, you know, you get new blood after seven years  or whatever.  Maybe that DNA got washed out.  Chris, I had the most brilliant advice for you and I'm not giving it to you now.  I'm sorry, Hope.  I know I fucked up. 
[00:16:00]  You're a chatty cat that you were talking over.  I'm sorry.  We don't ask for much from our show.  I know.  And the one thing is we ask is that you try to listen.  I know.  I know at times we don't listen.  My first call.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, jeez.  Are we done giving this stupid ass advice?  Yeah.  I say get married and good luck to you. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, buy a ring.  Make it very expensive.  Make sure you're paying for it for years and years to come.  Nah, it's cash.  And then live happily ever after.  Nah, it's all.  Have sex.  The first time you have sex after you're married, knock her up.  So it ruins her body.  And like Opie suggested, perhaps some Down syndrome children.  I don't really do.  I hope you have two kids that have Down syndrome.  I hope your wife now has like lasagna belly from having the kids. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, those frilly lasagna noodles.  Big stretch marks.  Yeah.  Does she have firm titties?  Sir?  Huh?  Don't be discouraged.  Does she have firm titties?  Oh, me?  No, your fucking wife-to-be.  Yeah, they're pretty firm.  You know, sir, as a caller, you need a lot to be desired.  You are really bad.  You sure this isn't Jeff Reardon?  Are you on those depressant medications that are going to...  I got my medication and I robbed $200 from a jewelry store, man. 
[00:17:30]  He's up on the news.  Got to give him that much.  Meh.  I don't know.  Meh.  Should I get married?  Meh.  Call me crazy, but I say we cut our losses.  Cut our losses.  I'm sorry about, you know, being a chatty cat.  I was just drunk.  Ah, Brian in Tennessee.  Yeah.  What's up, Brian?  How you doing?  All right.  Hi, sir.  I want to say I've been there for about a year and found y'all, and I've never changed 
[00:18:00]  a channel now.  Oh, thank you, Brian.  Thank you.  Ryan and Fez, way back when they were in Houston, glad to see them there.  Yes.  May it be the first to say happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  It's been kind of overlooked today because the first call was bad.  It sounded like.  I smell bit, and I can't believe Opie didn't see it.  Thanks, buddy.  What?  You've got the new, I said I smell bit, and I can't believe Opie didn't see it.  What's the bit?  What's the bit, sir?  And this ought to be a gem.  You've got that new pal pop where you can see the collars. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, one of the fine female listeners called up Playwood Center pants.  Before, after you guys guessed, you just had to take her word for it.  And now she's got a show.  I don't think we have a woman out there that's brave enough to play Guess What's In My Pants on Pal Talk.  Well, apparently right when we logged on this morning, we could have played Guess What's In My Pants,  and I could have won with a cock because somebody was on camera jacking off in the room. 
[00:19:00]  He was in one of our rooms?  The room was open before I got there, which made me a little miffed.  Like, it's my room, and I log into it, and it's open and full, and people are partying.  There's a guy jacking off.  I was like the parent that came home.  Hey, what's going on here?  Get out of here, you darn kids.  You've got the key to the house.  I know.  How do they get in?  I don't know.  Oh, some people have some admin things so they could boot Arabs that come in there because Opie means something in Arabia. 
[00:19:30]  And the name of the room is Opie and Anthony Live.  And for some reason, the Arabian people, the towel heads, think it's some religious thing.  Is there still an Arabia, by the way?  I don't know.  I like calling it Persia myself.  And they think Opie means something to their Allah.  Yeah.  And so I need some admin people because during the show I can't kick out the towel head.  And then apparently they're opening up the rooms and having jack-off parties in my goddamn room. 
[00:20:00]  My goddamn room.  They're wiping their dicks on your stuffed animals.  Yeah.  All right.  Brian, I like the idea, actually.  I don't know if it's going to happen.  I don't know if we have a girl brave enough to play Guess What's in My Pants live on Pal Talk.  I bet you do.  And tell Jimmy's friends to stay out of your room.  Sir, that wasn't my friend that would do that.  My friend's in the teen and under room.  Yeah, it'll be good.  I'll drive a truck and sleep and sleep all night long.  All right.  Well, we'll try to figure that out.  If anyone wants to play Guess What's in My Pants of the female variety on Pal Talk, please IM us or do whatever you have to do. 
[00:20:30]  And I actually have a bit idea, which is a great year-end bit idea.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Which is a great year-end bit idea.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy Norton?  I think that we should all list our New Year's resolutions.  Shut up! 
[00:21:00]  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  But, like, you really don't want to know my New Year's resolution.  Oh, no.  I do.  I think that's fun.  Fun?  Dude, it'll be fun.  I can guess yours.  You can guess mine.  No, I know.  I don't want to interrupt this program. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  The ozone is exciting of the day.  Medic freaks out there.  All right, Dan in Boston, what's going on?  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  I'm at the gym last night, and I'm walking around, and all of a sudden I see these little  sets of legs on the leg press.  It was a midget doing the leg press at the gym.  Funniest goddamn thing I've ever seen.  A midget doing a leg press?  Don't they have those weird formed legs anyway that look like they're really muscular?  Well, he's doing these, like, little pumps and all that stuff, and it's just dying. 
[00:22:00]  I'm punching out.  I'm flamin'.  Bye.  No, actually, that's pretty good.  It conjures up a pretty good image.  I like that.  A midget working his legs.  Instead of spending time on the leg press, they should hang from the chin bar.  Yeah, tie weights to their little rotten feet.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  I was at the gym the other day in Great Neck.  My girlfriend goes to the gym right there over in Great Neck, and I go, like, as a guest. 
[00:22:30]  You know, use the pool and whatnot.  Yeah, check it out a little bit, right?  Use the treadmill over there.  Use the pool.  And I had to go in the locker room, and I had to go in the locker room and stuff.  Oh, boy.  That's always a problem.  Yeah.  It is always a fucking problem.  That's why I have a treadmill at my house, and I use that.  And thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  And I could just do that, shower afterwards. 
[00:23:00]  No problems.  So I'm using the pool, and my girlfriend.  Oh, happy birthday to your girlfriend.  Thank you.  Yes, happy birthday, Jimmy Norton, my girlfriend.  Yes, you asshole.  Jimmy, you got the same birthday.  Yeah, yes.  That's my girlfriend.  Exactly.  Thank you.  And we go in, and apparently the locker room.  Wait, she gets ripped off, though, man.  Why is that?  Birthday near Christmas?  Yeah, I know.  That sucks.  Yeah.  People that have their birthdays near Christmas, too.  So you get, like, one present. 
[00:23:30]  It never bounces out of it.  One big thing.  And people go, no, we give them a little extra.  Yeah.  It never equals.  It's a ripoff.  It really is.  You got to just hope later in life you hook up with a successful disc jockey who can afford  to get stuff for Christmas and New Year.  Ooh.  No, actually, we don't even exchange gifts.  No.  It's like Christmas every day for us.  She wants something, we buy it.  I want something, I buy it. 
[00:24:00]  What the hell, Al?  What the fuck is Christmas?  I do get something.  But it's nice to open something up Christmas morning.  We do.  Doesn't she get you a tie or something?  I like to get a tie for Christmas.  Some smart slacks.  Maybe a pair of socks.  A Van Heusen sweater.  Ooh, some Old Spice cologne.  Splash that on.  High karate is my brand.  You ever used canoe, did you?  Ooh.  What, brute?  Brute.  Anyway, you were saying.  Sorry, Ant.  Yes, the, uh, the, uh, well, obviously, uh, after you go in the pool, she goes in and 
[00:24:30]  showers in the locker room.  So she assumed I was going to go into the guy's locker room and shower.  I go into the guy's locker room.  I've been in the pool.  How far of a drive is it from the gym to my house?  Three minutes?  I'm not going to now strip nude and hop in the shower.  With that huge Italian hog.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This hits the bench. 
[00:25:00]  A big delicious appendage.  I need two towels just to cover it up.  It, I walk in the second, dude, it is the second, the second, and this has happened every gym  experience ever.  The second I walk in there, old naked guy has his one foot up on the bench.  That Turkish taffy ball bag is just hanging with the, uh, gray hairs, the fucking, the, the, the, the flab 
[00:25:30]  ass, and he's just drying away.  And, and it shocks you.  I walk in, and that's the first thing you see.  And I look away and make the, the, ooh face.  That's more the, ugh.  No, it was the same face that, uh, in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when, uh, what's-her-face  walked in on, uh.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And the guy jerking off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant the same face he made looking at her.  Yeah.  So I'm jacking off, right? 
[00:26:00]  And, uh.  Just disgusting.  And another guy, and they just, they're walking around with their dicks out.  But, you get, uh.  I understand it's a lot.  It's a gym, dude.  No.  No.  But stop.  No.  Keep the fucking towel around your waist.  There's towels.  You, you can't run out of towels in a gym.  There are stacks of towels.  There's a guy's job that is just to bring in the fucking towels.  Yeah, if you're naked for more than a second in a locker room, you're an exhibitionist.  Simple as that.  Well.  You get naked guy, um, uh, shaving yet? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah, right by the sink.  Why?  Why be naked?  Why, first of all, shave at the gym?  Yeah.  If you're going to do it, why do it naked?  Because he's going right to work, probably.  But why do it naked?  Why be naked?  Do you shave at home naked?  Uh, no.  I don't either.  Why be naked?  Have a goddamn towel on.  It's common courtesy.  There is no one in that locker room, unless there's a flaming faggot in there, that wants  to see old man fucking body, that wants to see that. 
[00:27:00]  You're not, you're not giving someone a little show.  Why be naked?  There's no women in there.  Why be naked in the locker room?  Jimmy?  I, uh, forgot to mention to you guys what happened to me when I was in L.A.  Oh.  Uh, in a spa.  Sexy story, is it?  Yeah.  It's a hot one.  Uh, it's kind of like what you were talking about.  I completely, I can't believe I didn't call in with this.  I forgot.  I went to a spa to get a facial.  I wanted to get a facial.  Oh, full.  I was like, pfft.  No, not the kind. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, I thought you meant like.  Not the good kind.  No, I went, I got a massage and a facial from this place.  I wanted, I never did it before in my life.  I wanted to try it.  I treated myself to a spa.  You're so fancy.  Fancy gentlemen.  You are.  So afterwards, I, uh, there's a, there's a, a jacuzzi in there.  So afterwards, I go in.  Now, I don't bring a bathing suit or anything to the spa.  I don't.  I see trouble already.  Well, yeah.  Oh, no.  But, no.  Oh, go ahead.  There's not many people there. 
[00:28:00]  So I first, the first thing I did when I got to the spa before I even went in there is  I went in and I took a shit.  I took a good shit in the spa bathroom.  And then I went and I showered.  Yeah.  And they give you a robe, a fancy place.  Fancy?  Which, of course, you know, the lines were flying in my head.  Of course.  The robe on, you know, of course, I enjoyed it.  Robert Reed Memorial robe.  Chuckle to myself.  RR on an extra pocket for tissues.  Give me those for you.  And, uh, so I go in.  I get my massage and my facial.  It's just great.  Which really hurt.  Actually, I was tearing.  She was popping zits in my nose. 
[00:28:30]  It hurt so badly I was tearing because it was really bad.  Yeah.  Um, so I come back in.  I wanted to go into one of the hot tubs.  There's two hot tubs.  One's hotter than the other.  And there's nobody in there.  Who wouldn't want to go in?  Right.  I just wanted to treat myself to the spa experience.  So I'm naked under my robe.  So I go right up to the hot tub.  And I just, I get right in.  Nude.  What?  No!  I was nude in the hot tub.  Lots of bubbles.  So no one would be able to even see your nose.  No one could see. 
[00:29:00]  And then.  Of course.  There's an of course.  I see an older gentleman milling about the locker room.  Now there's two hot tubs.  One empty and one that I'm in.  And he comes up and I'm like, ugh.  And he goes, splash.  He waltzes right over.  Takes off his robe.  He's totally nude.  No.  Gets in the hot tub.  What is that?  You're not.  What?  What?  Gets in the hot tub with me.  And you got out.  And you got out. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  But, well, let me talk a little bit.  How many seconds did it take you to get out?  A few minutes.  I didn't want to be rude.  A few minutes.  Here's what happened.  It gets worse.  It's like bubbling egg drop soup.  It gets worse.  The story should be he got in, I got out.  Right.  Not even a pause.  Not even he got in and then.  And I, well, I got out.  I yelled, faggot.  I made a dash from my towel.  Well, no.  He had really blue eyes, to be honest with you.  And I know.  Because he got in and he's like, hey, how are you?  And he looked like Malcolm McDowell, but, like, fat.  That's what he looked like.  That's the point around him.  He had white hair. 
[00:30:00]  It was L.A.  It could have been him.  No, I thought that.  But his eyes look like Malcolm McDowell.  Yeah, I know.  But when someone's getting into a hot tub, you look him in the eye.  You'd have touched this hog and go, Malcolm.  Malcolm.  Picture, please.  Food.  Ho, ho.  So we're sitting there, and he's.  Singing in the hot tub.  Naked in the hot tub.  Are you through hurting me?  Yes, I'm sorry.  I didn't sing in the hot tub.  I was very, very uncomfortable, believe it or not.  Yeah, I would assume.  And he's talking to me. 
[00:30:30]  And I know immediately he's flirting with me.  He's like.  How do you know, Jimmy?  How do you know?  Because I've done that to chicks.  I know how you talk to somebody when you want to talk to somebody younger and more nubile,  if I may.  And he's just chatting with me.  His rod was like a U-boat periscope poking up out of the.  Dude.  I fucking feel his foot hit my foot.  Oh, no.  This must be what they do in the fucking spas.  And he's like, so, you know, ah, it's something, some nonsense he said.  Did you get arrested for punching him? 
[00:31:00]  I pulled my foot back.  You should have been the next thing.  You're absolutely right.  I pulled my foot back.  Yeah.  And I'm like, ah, no, no, no, no.  And I didn't look at him.  I didn't want to encourage him.  And he got the hint that I wasn't interested because he was eating an apple in the hot tub nude.  And then.  Here's the deal quickly.  What, sweetie?  And then please continue.  Oh, yes.  Being nude in the hot tub in that spa is only for gay guys.  The guy wasn't being inappropriate.  You were.  You were being inappropriate by being naked in the hot tub and not being gay. 
[00:31:30]  You were being a cock tease.  You fucking cock tease.  I was Scarlett Johansson in that place just showing all of my wares.  You were a cock tease.  Because anyone naked in that hot tub is gay.  When I saw him walk in, and I knew he couldn't see my fat, out of shape body.  He just saw my face, young, boyish face, eager at the spa, looking for an older gentleman's guidance.  Believe me, I was an 11.  I was an 11.  He hit fucking pay dirt when he saw this face. 
[00:32:00]  So I feel his foot touch my foot.  And I back my foot up.  And I think he gets the hint immediately that this is not where I'm at.  And, I mean, it's like he's just talking about this.  I forget what he's even talking about.  Like, I'm like, yeah, the water's hot.  He's like, ah, it feels good.  I feel his foot touch and hit mine again.  But, like, he's stretchy.  Like, he's just talking.  Oh, boy.  And, uh...  A little footsie.  See, now, if you were gay, you'd play a little footsie back.  If I was gay, I would have left my foot there, and we would have had a connection.  And before you know it, you're feeling a foot on your bag. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I just...  Believe me, I got out of there very quickly.  After that, I was really annoyed.  And I got to say something here.  If I've ever made a woman feel like that, my apologies.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry if I've ever done that.  Really?  I felt like...  He wants it.  You've been in a hot tub with one fag, but then you've been in a hot tub with them all.  He wants it.  He needs it.  He was eating an apple.  He complained about the apple being mealy.  I was eating an apple. 
[00:33:00]  I touched my foot with his foot.  It was a fucking foot thing on my foot.  A foot thing on your foot.  So I got out.  I didn't even want him to see my cock.  I was so annoyed that I just turned around.  You gave him a treat.  No, he saw my ass walking out.  Believe me.  That was probably a treat for him.  There was a sheen of hot tub water on it.  It gave off.  It was a glistening bottom.  He probably jacked to the image of your ass.  It should have.  And my awful love handles.  Your boyish ass.  Just glistening with those little hot tub bubbles on it. 
[00:33:30]  Sliding down my buttery thighs.  Believe me.  I should have.  Because you know how it is in the hot tub.  Your bag is all hanging.  Your fucking dick looks big.  Because you're not hard.  You usually have a bathing suit on or some type of swim trunks on.  I always do in my gym.  The gym I work at in New York, I always have.  I was in my building, so I go down.  I always have a bathing suit when I go to the steam room.  Yeah.  Always a bathing suit.  One time I didn't, but I wore my underwear.  But I saw one guy kind of on a Sunday flirting with me in there. 
[00:34:00]  That was kind of creepy.  But it was really steamy.  We were across the room from each other.  I was at this place called Plato's Retreat.  And I didn't understand.  Gay guys everywhere.  This is a steam room.  You're supposed to be able to work out in your own building.  I can't work out in my own goddamn building.  You know what it is?  When you walk around looking like this, it's going to happen.  You think I don't know that I'm fucking...  I think I don't know what I'm fucking walking around with?  I think I don't know the goods?  They're a weapon.  Yeah, they can't help it.  But he didn't touch me.  He was across the steam room.  It was really steamy.  And I could just see him looking.  And I saw he did like the old foot thing like this. 
[00:34:30]  Like the pronounced foot separation.  Yeah.  Lean back against the tile wall.  And I could see his hand kind of going into his bathing suit.  But it was so steamy that that was all I saw.  And then I didn't respond.  So I guess that was the end of it.  I guess.  I've had relatively few of those experiences.  I mean, I go to the steam room a lot in my building.  That's the only time that ever happened.  I can't stand the edge, Jim.  Jimmy's like a hot chick.  He's a hot chick in these situations.  To gay guys, you're the hot broad.  The hot piece. 
[00:35:00]  Not even.  To gay guys who are disasters.  To fucking like...  I saw those Ricky Martin photos in there.  Believe me, I'm a minus five to those guys like I am to any hot chick.  But to those fucking...  Those married gay guys or the 55-year-old ex-producer gay guys, I'm a fucking delicious treat.  There's a prize.  I'm a delicious treat.  Well, the Ricky Martin photos, you've got to see these today.  Holy crap.  They're in the paper today.  Him on some beach in Bali, I guess.  I don't even know where the hell they are.  Wherever.  He's on vacation in a tiny Speedo with another guy working out on a beach. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, they're doing push-ups together.  And one guy, I don't know, his junk in his bathing suit looks like every time he goes  down for a push-up, he's doing hunting piss clams or something.  Poking the sand for some type of wildlife.  And they're looking at each other all lovingly.  Smiling.  Smiling with their bronzed bodies.  They're doing...  And then scroll down a little there, E-Rock.  Wait, let me look at that one for a little bit first before you scroll down. 
[00:36:00]  It looked long enough.  I've seen it long enough.  This tells a story.  It looked long enough.  Scroll down.  Look, they're doing yoga together.  Like, I don't know, two feet apart.  Almost in a spooning position.  It really looks like a spooning position.  It's awful.  What else?  Let's see what else they got here.  Yeah.  Wow.  Just Ricky walking down the beach.  He is in depressingly good shape, though.  Like, that little thing, the V, that Ope kind of has that I've noticed a few times.  All right, shut up.  Well, no, I'm just saying that you happen to have not as pronounced as Rick does. 
[00:36:30]  If he would hop in that hot tub and touch this foot on yours, Jim.  I would have just asked him another question.  How's the taurine going, Rick?  And then there they are, shaking out the sand from their blanket together.  Like every couple does at the beach.  Yeah, man, you don't do that for another guy.  Like, that's a guy-girl thing.  If you're a guy, you do it yourself.  That's either just a guy thing or a guy-girl thing.  Or a guy-girl.  Never guy-guy thing. 
[00:37:00]  No.  You get your buddy and help me.  You want to help me shake the sand out of my blanket there, pal?  Sure, I'd love to.  I'd be happy to help you.  I was touching somebody's foot in the hot tub.  It didn't mean anything.  Paul on Long Island.  Yeah, we used to have this guy over at New York Sports Club in Manhattan that showered with the curtain open.  And then he'd, like, wax himself down with the lotion like a friggin' tree frog.  Naked.  A tree frog.  His back legs getting the back of his head.  Exactly.  All right, Paul. 
[00:37:30]  Take care, guys.  I don't mind naked guy.  I don't like the faggy.  I don't like the vibe.  Any naked guy.  That doesn't bother me.  Any naked guy bothers me.  It's a goddamn gym.  You're right.  Why all of a sudden, just because it's a gym, naked people can walk around?  Meaning if it's legitimate nudity.  There's a difference because, like, when you're getting out of the shower.  What's legitimate?  There's no real legitimate nudity.  There is no...  There are towels everywhere.  Wrap your shit up.  I don't want to fucking see your cock and balls.  Oh, it doesn't bother me.  Don't...  Don't want to say it. 
[00:38:00]  I'll shower.  If I shower, I don't panic if a guy sees my ass and dick for a second.  Who cares?  I hope you end up in prison.  I'll even do jumping jacks for the fella.  Go ahead.  Take a look.  I was in the hot tub.  It's hanging.  Go on.  Enjoy.  Getting you naked in the hot tub.  Just doing that.  I was alone.  I don't care.  Just doing it.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You were alone, but you didn't put a lock on the door.  You knew that other people could have come in.  There was no door.  It was wide open area.  Exactly.  You knew other people could have come in. 
[00:38:30]  Nice spa, though.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike!  Horrible, disgusting man.  Hey.  Hey, the other bad thing about the naked guy is when they sit on the fake leather chairs  without the towel underneath, leave the skid marker on there.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  The ass print.  It just was gross.  It's like he's hanging out watching TV, literally.  There's a towel on top of him, which was nice, but nothing underneath.  And it's like he gets up and you hear that.  It's an exhibitionist thing for these people.  There are some guys, I guess, that are just guys that feel no inhibitions, but I think that 
[00:39:00]  that is rare.  I think the guys you see at the gyms that are naked have this exhibitionist mentality, and  this is a place they can absolutely get away with being naked in front of people.  And I'm not saying it gives them this raging hard-on turn-on, but there's just something  they enjoy about, hey, I can fucking be naked here.  Some may be, yeah.  I don't want to sing it. 
[00:39:30]  Not some.  When you're, like, shaving naked.  No reason.  There's no reason for that.  That's kind of creepy.  I'll agree.  I did shave in the spa, though.  You said, why would you shave in the spa?  Because a gentleman wants to shave.  Shave your pubes?  No, I do that in my own shower.  Gary in Vegas.  What's up?  Completely, yeah.  Look.  Hey, what's going on?  No, it's all right.  We don't need to see that.  Put that in.  Talk away.  Gary!  Hey, it's Gary.  Hey, but anyways, naked faggot goes in the water.  Jimmy's in the water.  All right, Jimmy. 
[00:40:00]  He touches his foot and his eyes roll back white.  Saw one rubber foot once.  Hey, take it easy, guys.  Punch it out.  All right, man.  Let's drink to your red, dangling, delicious ball bag.  All heat-infused ball bag.  Yeah, here's...  All blood pumping to it.  It looks like a heart.  The stories are coming in like crazy. 
[00:40:30]  Sean in New Hampshire, naked guy in men's room,  drying his hair.  Like, why?  Why?  There's no need to be naked.  Sean, why?  Why was this guy doing that?  Sean from New Hampshire?  Yeah.  Yeah, Sean.  I was in the shower, and I finished drying off,  and I put my underwear on in the shower stall.  I go out to, you know, brush my teeth probably by the sink,  and this guy I can only describe as looking like Chewbacca,  when she's all completely hairy,  was drying his hair and just left his cock and balls on the sink. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, he was that tall that maybe when he leaned forward,  the edge of the sink was kind of, like,  uncomfortable against his shaft or something.  Yeah.  There you go.  And there, yeah, like someone shaving at the sink,  let's say,  and they're naked.  His dick is touching the edge of the sink.  He kind of, you know,  you're up against the fucking sink.  So what are you saying?  You got to wait until he backs off to kiss it?  It's all pressed up against there.  I'm saying, 
[00:41:30]  there's dick grease on the fucking sink.  Here's a great one.  All right, you're getting the basic ones coming in right now,  but Adam in Jersey has a good one.  Adam?  Yeah.  We used to have this dude called Stinky Eddie  at the gym that we worked at.  This guy would walk around in ballet tights  with socks stuffed in there.  This dude was naked before he even hit the men's room.  He used to go in there,  spread eagle,  and bend down a little bit  so his junk was flapping in between his legs  and take his towel  and beat his junk with it to dry it off. 
[00:42:00]  Everybody used to know when Stinky Eddie was in the gym  and they would just avoid the men's room.  You'd hear that slapping of him  whapping his dick with the towel.  But why would Stinky Eddie stuff his undershorts  and then all of a sudden be naked all the time?  Why would he give himself away?  I'm pretty sure he was gay.  I think he was trolling.  Do you think?  Yeah, I think so.  That's funny.  Very good, Adam.  Let's go to Eric in New York.  Eric?  Good morning, boys. 
[00:42:30]  Good morning, man.  I paid $1,500 for a membership in Valleys.  Yeah.  Always went home sweaty.  Never took a shower there.  I saw what was going on there, man.  I never showed up in the gym again.  It was ridiculous.  You blew off your whole membership  because you saw a naked guy?  Yeah.  No, some of the gyms are just gay havens.  Yeah.  I don't consider myself homophobic,  but I just couldn't take that.  Yeah, that's the difference between...  I've heard of guys blowing each other  and stuff like that.  That doesn't...  I mean, the gym I work at,  it's in my building. 
[00:43:00]  So I think it's people who are living there  and that's just fucking creeps rolling through.  Except for the one guy  who just couldn't resist when he saw me.  I mean...  Let's go to Fargo.  We love calls from Fargo.  How are you?  Hey, Fargo.  How's it going?  Well, we had a little trouble  down at the gym the other day.  The guy was in there totally naked.  I don't know.  It was a little cold outside,  so maybe he was experiencing some shrinkage.  I don't know.  Kind of funny looking.  No, here's what's going on. 
[00:43:30]  Yesterday when you guys ended the show,  you said we were going to play  fucking Guess What's in My Pants.  And I tuned in  and you guys are talking about  naked, sweaty men.  Yeah, we're gay again.  What the hell is that about?  It's just the conversation turned this way  because I had to express my disgust  for the naked guy at the gym.  And you sparked a memory in me.  All right.  I'm sorry there, Carl.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Carl.  I appreciate it.  It's getting lost in all this hype and gay talk.  I think that call is going to end that discussion.  Said he was going up by the lake.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[00:44:00]  That lady was supposed to,  or that woman or that girl,  whatever she was,  was supposed to call right away today.  Lying cocktease.  And then we're trying to get a girl  on Pal Talk to do it live.  On Pal Talk.  I know that's going to be almost impossible.  Yeah, you know,  we got a couple of girls on Pal Talk,  and no offense, ladies,  but they're the same girls all the time.  Right.  You know,  they're beautiful and everything,  but they're,  don't go,  oh,  I'm saying they're the same girl.  To play Guess What's in My Pants, 
[00:44:30]  we need a girl we don't know.  And here's Lucci pulling her tits out.  Lucci is what we call a very good egg.  What a good egg she is.  But eventually,  I talked to the Pal Talk people yesterday,  and they're going to contact Ben Sparks  about getting us some more cameras in here,  and I think that we will get more girls  in these rooms to show us their vagas.  And then the other girl up on the cam  is doing something there,  laying in bed again.  Is that,  you just have your panties on,  and they're kind of halfway covered  with her covers? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah,  but she's always laying in bed.  It's like talking to Dreyfus,  and whose life is it anyway?  She never gets out of bed.  She just lays there.  I want bunny rabbits on my bib.  Anybody remember that?  All right.  Well,  we'll try to get a girl  to play Guess What's in My Pants.  We'll take a quick break.  We got some things to do today.  Thanks.  Bill Burr's stopping by to say hi.  We haven't seen him in a long time.  9 a.m.  Oh,  Bill Burr's coming here  when Jimmy's here.  Yes.  That ought to keep him off his high horse.  It's going to be a little tension.  I can't wait to see that.  No tension. 
[00:45:30]  Our feet may touch under the console.  Close enough.  He should be naked.  We have the Jeff Reardon story.  We have Club Soda Candy stand-up.  I guess he killed  with his hacky material.  Oh,  he's good.  We got audio of that.  I went to see King Kong.  And we'll talk about King Kong next as well.  Had a little problem in the theater, too.  Really?  No surprise.  It never fails.  How about we'll start there  when we get back?  Absolutely.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi. 
[00:46:00]  Bill.  Hey,  my name's Danny,  and I've been sent to the O&A Archives  to gather up material  for O&A's bonus bits.  It's a whole pile of clips  from the O&A show  that we wanted to fit  into our year-end special,  but we couldn't do it  because of timing issues.  And we couldn't even find them.  I wonder what's in this drawer.  Ooh!  Bits!  And they're best bits!  You know what?  We could probably make  a whole other show out of this.  It's Opie and Anthony's bonus bits 
[00:46:30]  this Friday, December 30th  from 7 to 11 a.m.  And then afterwards,  we'll get on our webcams  and show everyone our dicks.  Not those bits, Travis.  It ain't pretty!  Bravo!  Hey, I like that.  That's a funny fucking promo.  Oh, just kidding?  Pretty Vegas in excess  in the background here.  It's the O&A program  on XM Satellite Radio.  We like to call it  the O&A virus  on this fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  Get your WoW stickers 
[00:47:00]  by going to  opianthony.com.  You throw the WoW stickers  on your cars  and your trucks  and there are women out there  that will flash their titties.  I am flirting  with disaster here.  Why?  Well, I'm going back and forth.  Doug Out Doug  is IMing me  about a program  that does video captures  of things like  Pal Talk  and stuff like that  so you can capture  the video, honestly.  But I'm also  instant messaging  my girlfriend  about something 
[00:47:30]  later  and I have to take  a code that Doug gave me  and give it to her  so I have it later  when I go to  put this program  on my computer  at home.  Very dangerous  when you're going  back and forth  like that on IMs.  I think I sent  Doug Out Doug  and I love you  sweetie pie.  Not that I don't.  And you sent  your girlfriend  let me see another  picture of that cock  Doug. 
[00:48:00]  Oh wow.  I do have a problem  with that very funny  promo that just aired  though.  A problem?  The fake footsteps  are awful.  They really are.  Someone has to call  Steve out on the fake footsteps.  Why?  What was it?  Like 1950s?  I had to get picky  but maybe you should  use something  different than  your own paws.  What's that?  Nothing.  What did you use?  Something.  Steve come on  this is a really  good show.  He's an old  Foley.  He's all flustered. 
[00:48:30]  Steve has entered  the studio.  A 90 year old  Foley technician  with half cut  coconuts on a piece  of plywood.  I knew.  Steve could take  out this whole room  but he just gets  nervous when he has  to throw the  headphones on and  talk this live.  I wish I knew  why.  The footsteps  I was going to  draw attention to  them because that's  the only set of  footsteps I have  in the sound  effects library  right now.  They're awful.  They're high heels.  They're high heel  footsteps and I try  to pitch correct  them.  I try to speed  them up.  It doesn't even  sound like anyone's  walking.  There's no way to  get a dat recorder  and a hard floor  and someone just 
[00:49:00]  tried it.  Real footsteps  don't sound like  real footsteps.  It's that weird  it's that Foley  artist thing where  they actually  manufacture these  sounds.  It's production  footsteps.  It's kind of like  production guns.  They don't sound  like real guns.  Yeah that's true.  What if you just  took Travis's head  and smashed it  against the wall  a few times?  I can't because  Travis is now  promo homo and  I can't damage him.  He gives everyone  roles.  Travis is now  promo homo.  Anytime he needs  some kind of gay 
[00:49:30]  line he goes to  Travis.  Anytime you need  a sweeper or a  promo thrown  completely into  another direction  you bring Travis  in to just say  weird gay shit.  Why not make  Sam promo homo?  We'll bring  Sam back but  right now we're  still trying to  figure out how  to bring Sam  back from the  Toby disaster.  Sam is promo  homo just by  default.  Whenever he  talks you're  like who's  that fag?  Oh it's just  Sam.  He's not gay.  You know Steve  sits at home for  hours thinking  about all this  stuff.  I know he does. 
[00:50:00]  He's got the  Ramon.  He thought Toby  was going to be  a big hit.  Toby just didn't  go over.  It just proved  he thought it was  going to be the  follow up hit to  Ramon.  What do you  think?  Toby from  Yellowstone was  going to call  up?  No.  Toby.  I wish I  thought the  worst radio  character ever.  I'd like to  hear more  Toby.  I know you  would.  There's actually  a bunch of  people out there  that would but  I know it  irritates you.  A bunch you  mean none.  I say he  gives Toby one  more shot.  One more shot  Steve.  We could take  it in another  direction like we 
[00:50:30]  could just have  him in a room  strapped to a  table.  He just threw  his arms in  the air like  yes victory.  I got another  shot.  What is  Toby salad?  Do we have  Toby?  Because a lot  of new listeners  today may not  know Toby.  It sounds like  Sam.  It sounds like  Sam just  pitched up a  little bit.  Sam has a  very unusual  voice.  And then we  got to get  back to Danny  fake walking  because it's  pretty funny to  hear.  Where's the  Toby, Derek?  You got it?  Hit it.  The following is  a simple guide to  getting your very  own wow sticker  from the Opie and  Anthony show.  O and A  party rock.  That's right 
[00:51:00]  Toby.  O and A  party rock  indeed.  Boy I love  them.  Head over to  opieandanthony.com  and click on the  wow sticker button.  Sometimes I pick  my nose with a  coat hanger.  That's nice.  You keep doing  that.  It's all sticky.  Or send a  self-addressed  stamped envelope to  the Opie and  Anthony show.  Attention wow  stickers.  111 West 57th  Street, Suite 500.  New York, New York.  10019.  Gosh that was easy.  It sure was Toby.  Now put that wow  sticker somewhere  obvious.  Putting it on my  eyebrows.  Now now Toby I  wouldn't do that if  I were you.  Adios.  Eyebrows.  And finally enjoy 
[00:51:30]  bosoms.  One time I walked  in on my grandma in  the shower.  I saw her boobs.  I cried a lot.  There you have it  Toby.  Alright.  That is so fucking  bad.  Toby's incorrigible.  The voice.  I hate to admit  this.  It's well written.  Can I admit  something?  Sure.  He's ripping me  off hoo hoo.  The old  Spuds Buckley  used to sound  like that.  Spuds Buckley  sounded like that?  Spuds Buckley  used to sound  like that.  Did he?  Oh yeah.  Oh boy. 
[00:52:00]  Back in the day  when I was  Spuds Buckley  that voice is  very similar to  what I did  as Spuds Buckley.  Too bad there's  no tape of  Spuds Buckley  anywhere to be  found.  None.  It's really a shame.  Back in the old  analog days.  Spuds Buckley.  It exists  somewhere.  I'm sure  someone could  find Spuds  They have tape  of the Hindenburg  crashing.  That audio  Spuds Buckley  isn't existing.  If you guys  decide to be  nice to me  someday I will  bring it in.  I have a whole  greatest hits  cassette of  Spuds Buckley. 
[00:52:30]  I gotta hear it.  You have to.  You have to.  I have to.  I've got to hear  Spuds Buckley  and I know it  sounded like that.  That was the  Toby of its day.  I'm telling you  Spuds Buckley  sounded a lot like  Toby.  That's why  maybe I like  the Toby thing  because it brings  me back to when  I was first  starting in radio  and I had to do  the dumb voices  and try to make  a name for myself.  Was that your  character Spuds  Buckley was  like your character?  Spuds Buckley.  On the Bear Man  Morning Show  who now does  mornings back in 
[00:53:00]  Allentown.  It's called the  Bear Man.  Yeah we can call  the Bear Man.  I don't know if he  has any Spuds  Buckley.  He better.  He'll have it.  Anyway can we go  back to the Danny  promo and I want to  hear the fake  walking.  It just doesn't  match up.  The echo is good.  It sounds like  you're in some  kind of crazy  vault.  All that works.  But I had a  problem with the  footsteps.  Yeah we all did.  Really?  Yeah we were all  just debating  whether or not to  take them out  completely because  we couldn't  replace them or  then we were  going to draw  attention to it  by having him  say why am I 
[00:53:30]  wearing high heels?  What else is in  that mind of  yours?  What else are you  working on?  I'm just I'm  working on a bunch  of production for  Friday's thing and  we have a whole  bunch we have a  Nathaniel like  another one of  really dry Nathaniel  promos that's  coming up.  Love Nathaniel.  We're trying to  work Travis into  every promo where  he interrupts with  some gay comment.  Have you seen on  Whack Bag somebody  not sure who it  is has a picture of  Than with the angel  wings and a halo and  he's giving the  thumbs up and he  uses it whenever he  likes something.  On the bottom it 
[00:54:00]  says Thantastic.  This is  hysterical.  It's  fantastic.  All right let's  listen to Danny  walk down the  hall again here.  Hey my name's  Danny and I've  been sent to the  O&A archives to  gather up material  for O&A's bonus  bits.  It's a whole pile of  clips from the O&A  show that we wanted  to fit into our  year-end special but  we couldn't do it  because of timing  issues and we  couldn't even find  them.  I wonder what's in  this drawer. 
[00:54:30]  It sounds like a  tranny goose  stepping.  That is the worst  fake walking I've  ever heard.  It is so bad.  It is so bad.  That's  Thantastic.  I love that one  man.  Whose is that?  Give him a little  credit.  Scroll down and  look at the name  on top.  You should bring  in some coconuts  or something and  make your own fake  walking.  Mad Mav.  Very funny.  I know. 
[00:55:00]  Well it was just  slow.  Yeah it was a  little too slow  and a little too  sharp.  Very sharp.  Very deliberate.  I know.  I know.  How much money  worth Pro Tools in  there and you can't  fucking make that sound  like?  It's not Pro Tools.  It's the actual sound  libraries.  I'm going to see if I  can find some other  footstep haunted house  kind of thing because  that's really what I was  going for but that  seems like ideals  wobbling down a  hallway.  Definitely.  Rifle through that  little file cabinet.  That's Steve's brain.  Let's see.  Woman hating rape.  Violence against women. 
[00:55:30]  Women killing.  Gay joke.  Gay joke.  Women hating.  Women hating.  Shit my pants.  Lamone promo.  Steve.  Come on.  I haven't done a  misogynistic promo in  ages.  Yeah.  You just haven't  played one.  I guarantee you  there's a whole  little library he  just plays for his  own.  Oh yeah.  I hate luck man.  My head is a  different story  entirely.  Quite frankly.  Several of these  things going on.  Steve scared the  shit out of us  when we first started  XM with all the  promos he came up  with to begin this  adventure.  All the brutal  over the top  women hating promos 
[00:56:00]  that we played.  It was I spit on  your grave the  musical.  You just you want  that opportunity to  be a little bit  creative a little bit  more creative than  you would have been  normally with  terrestrial radio and  that's unfortunately  the well I went to  over and over and  over again.  Dove into.  Steve.  You had a great  year on this show.  Thanks Steve.  Absolutely.  As he leaves we'll  play a listener  sweeper.  One of my all time 
[00:56:30]  faves from the  listeners.  Do we have the  Greg and Tony show?  Yeah.  Creep.  That was really  creepy.  That's like kind of  like 50s monster show  ish. 
[00:57:00]  That's why I kind of  like it.  Speaking of monsters  ha ha.  Oh Kong.  Ooh.  Yes.  I saw Kong.  Like Jimmy you know  I'm not going to give  it a review.  It was the same  thing Jimmy said.  The beginning.  Yeah.  Get that fucking  knife out and edit  some of the beginning  of that shit.  That's what I said.  That whole thing in  New York when they're  just you know she's  the failed actress and  blah blah blah.  All right.  We get it.  Get on the ship.  Get on the ship.  You don't think some  of the action scenes  went on too long? 
[00:57:30]  No.  The action scenes I  loved every bit of it.  Didn't care how long  they went on.  That fucking T-Rex or  V-Rex whatever they're  calling them.  The fight.  It was amazing.  When she's put in  all these precarious  little situations  swinging on the vine  and the T-Rex thing  is swinging and just  snapping and just  missing her.  Shit like that.  I love it.  That could go on for  hours.  Love it.  The gorilla.  An amazing job on  that whole thing.  The facial expressions 
[00:58:00]  were fantastic.  Did you get nervous  watching them on the  building with the  heights and stuff?  Jimmy was saying  the other day how  it's dizzying to watch  that one shot where  they're going around  the building almost  to a point of view  above the biplanes.  It was dizzying.  And the biplanes  looked great.  They looked  unbelievable.  The old New York  looked fantastic.  The Empire State  building being like  the one building  just sticking out  above Manhattan  like that.  I think they did a 
[00:58:30]  great job.  Some of the side  CGI running scenes  looked bad.  Yeah.  Where they're running  in front of obviously  a screen.  That's what I  pointed out.  They green screened it.  But for some reason  the forward viewed  it looked bad.  Whenever they were  running from side  to side with  something behind  them or supposed  to be in the  foreground of it  it looked weird.  They didn't pull it  off.  But not many  complaints at all.  The movie was  amazing.  Yeah.  It was you know  you felt bad for 
[00:59:00]  the poor big guy.  You know he's just  kind of sitting up  on the Empire State  building like  watching the  watching the sun  come up.  You know.  People cry?  When the planes  are coming.  People cry around  you?  I think I heard  a couple of  girls sniffles.  A couple of  girls sniffle.  But no you know.  Nothing like that.  That would be  Ben laughing.  Yeah.  I turned around  and I saw some  moist eyes.  A little moist  all over the  theater.  Moist eyes.  It was kind of  sad. 
[00:59:30]  It was kind of  like movies.  It was.  You know he was  kind of the last  of his kind  there.  It was really  bad.  You kind of  really feel bad  for him when  they pull that  curtain up and  he's chained  there.  And he's just  kind of like  yeah they got  me.  This sucks.  They got me.  There's nothing  like that.  Especially when  you saw him so  brutal and just  kicking the shit  out of these  giant reptiles.  He's causing a  ruckus.  Punching him  right in the face.  Grab his arm.  He's just like  flips him over.  I'm going to  give this away.  I don't care.  I probably  shouldn't but  I will.  There's a scene  in the T-Rex  where he's  fighting T-Rex and 
[01:00:00]  grabs the T-Rex  by the upper jaw  and the lower jaw  and he's stretching.  Oh yeah.  I don't even know  if I want to say it  and wreck it for  people.  Well it was in  the original.  It was in the  original.  Alright yeah  turn off the  channel if you  don't want to  hear it.  It's nothing big  but turn it off  in 3, 2, 1.  Alright.  He grabs the  upper jaw  and the lower jaw  and then he reaches  in and he bites  the T-Rex's tongue  and he spits  the T-Rex's tongue  off and spits  it out. 
[01:00:30]  Oh that was  fucking great.  I think I actually  went yes  when he bit that  that was fucking  great.  And that guy  all I could think  of was Mike Tyson  at that point.  Yeah.  Kong was better  behaved.  Yeah really.  I thought she  did a great job  too.  What's her face?  Naomi Wadler.  I thought just  because she didn't  really have to do  much except like  look sad and  expressive.  The way she like  her eyes would  well up and turn  all red.  That was very good.  Jack Black thumbs 
[01:01:00]  up thumbs down.  Not as bad as I  thought it was  going to be.  Again I agree with  Jimmy on this thing.  I would have liked  to have seen  someone else do it.  A bit of a more  seasoned guy.  Jack Black.  He wasn't doing  a Jack Black  which is good  because that would  have destroyed the  movie.  But there are just  sometimes he makes  that smile.  Or yeah.  Boy that's a good  Jack Black mouth  you're making there  Jimmy.  It looks just like  him.  Or it'll make the  eyebrow thing go and  it kind of takes you  out of the picture.  Somebody pointed out 
[01:01:30]  I was talking  I saw Burr last  night.  Either Billy or  somebody else  pointed out that  he was kind of  mugging a little  bit like the  ooh.  Yeah.  I didn't even  notice that but  somebody might have  noticed.  It was kind of  like it's on  radio.  So picture the  face you'd be  ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I don't know what  actor could have  played that.  Hoffman?  I don't see more  Hoffman.  I don't know.  Oh that swarthy  sleazy guy with  internal things  going on.  I don't see him  like that 30s  thing.  You need someone 
[01:02:00]  that's almost like  Clark Gable-ish  but now you know  to play kind of  that fast talking  you know get  himself out of a  jam kind of guy.  You're a good  looking dame with  nice stems.  I want to put  you in my  picture.  I thought Jack  Black was a good  voice.  I really did.  It wasn't bad.  Believe me.  It could have  been a lot worse.  And they should  have killed him  at the end of  the movie.  I agree.  What?  And I'm not  have the ape  land on him.  It would have  got a huge  huge applause.  Yeah.  Huge applause 
[01:02:30]  if they killed  Jack Black.  But they  and the only  reason I'm  saying this is  because it's  just like the  original movie  he doesn't  die at the end.  No.  No he doesn't.  Remember in the  77 version they  killed Charles  Grodin who  was the scumbag.  Yeah.  Kong steps on  him I think  which people  did enjoy.  That was  actually great.  So what  happened in  the theater?  You said  something  happened.  Oh a little  problem.  Well cell  phone problem.  No no a  little boisterous  boisterous youths.  Now going to  the theater it's  not that crowded  which is good. 
[01:03:00]  Get a nice  middle of the  theater kind of  seat.  Perfect position.  No one in  front of us.  The theater isn't  crowded that badly  so the odds that  someone's going to  sit in front of  you.  Not that high.  You're in some  yapping during the  trailers that are  playing in the  back.  Like all right I  can deal with it  during this but  when this movie  starts I don't  want to hear this  shit.  Movie starts they  don't stop.  They get louder.  The good thing  none of them was 
[01:03:30]  over 12 years old.  It's not like the  old days.  A couple were  girls.  And they were all  white Jewish from  great neck.  So you had no  problem speaking up.  So I had no  problem.  It wasn't like I  was back in  Brooklyn.  What'd you do?  Just a brave guy.  I turned around and  said shut the fuck  up.  No I didn't curse.  I turned around and  said would you kids  shut up.  I said just shut up. 
[01:04:00]  And then I said  this on behalf of  the theater shut up.  You didn't.  I did.  At which point I  got applause and  yeah from people in  the theater.  I had the theater on  my side at that  point but I couldn't  believe I said on  behalf.  I was speaking on  behalf of the  theater.  Did you say it was  beauty that killed  the beast at the end?  You 12 year old  bully.  I am an ass. 
[01:04:30]  You're a little  brave.  I know.  I know.  Anthony loves talking  about his movie  experiences and it was  a little different in  Brooklyn.  Oh one like 14 year  old black kid and I'll  shut my mouth up.  On behalf of the  white race would you  shut up.  So they're like you  know he laughing and  kind of okay and I  know it's like it's  just not going to work.  Yeah.  So they keep yapping  and then these two  bruisers come in.  Big tall guys.  Where do they sit? 
[01:05:00]  Directly in front of  us.  There are seats all  over the place in  this theater.  All over.  Bam.  Right in front of  us.  I turn to my  girlfriend I go  come on.  And we move to the  other side of the  theater which same  seats but on the  left side where no  one was in front of  us where these two  motherfuckers could  have sat.  But who who walks  in knowing your big  guys because they  were big guys.  unless it was on  purpose.  If it was on  purpose then fine 
[01:05:30]  you pulled it off  guys.  Great gag.  But I don't think  it was.  I just think it's  people again.  Again.  Just being the only  people on the face  of the earth.  No fucking  consideration  whatsoever.  Boom.  Sit right in front  of us.  So we went to the  other side.  Now I don't have  the kids right  behind me anymore  and I don't have  the two bruisers in  front of me.  Why didn't you  speak up?  Because they were  very big gentlemen  and I didn't want  to get into a  ruckus without some  type of firearm on  me. 
[01:06:00]  I'm over to the  other side so now  I don't have to deal  with the talking  kids who are still  yapping by the way.  So I'm just sitting  there like now I  don't care.  A couple more  quiet from other  people in the theater  about these kids and  they won't stop.  The usher comes in  with the flashlight.  All right.  Out.  Out.  Which point a  couple of spattering  of applause as the  children are led  away to have to  call up mommy and  daddy and tell them  they were thrown  out.  Oh yeah.  I'm sure.  They're going to do  that.  I'm sure it was  you know. 
[01:06:30]  Mom.  Yeah.  These other people  were talking and  like we were sitting  near them and the  usher came up and  thought it was us  and threw us out  of the movie.  Can I have more  money?  Little fuckers.  I was so glad to  see him get thrown  out.  It was like half  hour into the movie.  So I'm sure they  tell everybody.  You sucked anyway.  Let's go to  Lunchbox.  Lunchbox.  So cool.  Hey guys.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  Anthony.  On behalf of the 
[01:07:00]  theater.  What are you?  Tony Randall?  On behalf of the  theater.  To preserve the  sanctity of the  theater.  In the words of the  immortal bard.  Shut up.  You little fuckers.  On behalf of the  theater.  None of us picked  up on that.  Yes.  Like they all got  together and elected  a spokes douche.  I am an asshole and  I know it but I had to 
[01:07:30]  say something.  You must be the  toughest guy in  Great Neck.  I am a thug in  Great Neck.  God.  Let me tell you.  That's an Italian from  the radio.  Don't tangle with him.  Easy.  You're nothing in  Brooklyn but man in  Great Neck forget about it.  I am the toughest guy in  Great Neck.  You can get things done.  It is great.  It's all little Jews and a  couple of Indians.  Why don't you just go to  the movie theater in some  of your Nazi garb and no  one will fuck with you.  I own no Nazi garb, Opie. 
[01:08:00]  I own one SS staff car  flag.  That is all I own.  Yeah.  For now.  To increase my collection.  That's all I own and it's  all memorabilia for World  War II not some  fanaticism for fascism or  Nazism.  I have this stuff as  memorabilia for an era  gone by.  Not an ideology that I  completely renounce.  That Norton line yesterday  still makes me laugh. 
[01:08:30]  His girlfriend fighting me  in the middle of the night.  Oh I know.  I heard that on the replay  yesterday and laughed at  that one you little fucker.  That made me laugh to  myself all day yesterday.  I have a problem.  Help me.  Douchebag.  It was delivered  perfectly yesterday.  I do not own Nazi  uniforms.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Can you help me?  Can you help me?  I don't know.  Can you help me?  I own no Nazi flags.  There is not one 
[01:09:00]  swastika in my house.  And just that I have to  say that makes me feel  a little off.  Oh my God.  Let's say hi to Cara  from MySpace.  Cara.  Hello.  Give us some good news  Cara.  Hi Cara.  Hi.  I called in to do  Guess What's in My Pants  and I know I was  supposed to call  like an hour ago  but I overslept.  You know what happened  because you overslept?  What?  We got really gay  because you decided  to oversleep. 
[01:09:30]  The show went  a little gay.  A little.  Because you were sleepy.  Hey, it's my vacation.  Wow.  You have the red  on with the blonde  hair, Cara?  I do.  Might I say for the record  you're lovely.  Thank you very much.  Oh, that's a picture  of her right there  from MySpace.  Are you my friend?  I am.  Are you Jimmy's friend?  Yes.  Bitch.  Where do you live?  Oh, here we go.  I live in Massachusetts.  I'm out of Boston.  Here we go.  You know when Jimmy 
[01:10:00]  starts this conversation  all I picture  is a leopard  in the bush  with the shoulders  getting haunched  and like the head  going down.  Funny that Jimmy  never asked  where the ugly girls live.  That's true.  If you're over 350  you could be living  in a cancer ward  and I wouldn't know it.  Why?  Because I won't ask.  If I hear this  I really enjoy the show.  I don't care where you live  fat pig.  I don't care if you do.  I messaged Jimmy  and I messaged Anthony  a bunch of times  and never got replies ever. 
[01:10:30]  I reply to everybody.  On MySpace message?  Yeah.  I don't get them.  For some reason  I had it to set  to you can't IM me.  I didn't mean to.  If you email me  I'll send you back  an apology, Kara.  Okay.  Alright, fine.  Now they know  what you look like.  Trust me,  you're going to get  a lot of emails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a plane ticket  to Philly  to see him  New Year's Eve  at the Power Theater.  That was a backhanded plug.  I'll take it.  Holy shit. 
[01:11:00]  Well, yeah.  So, yeah.  I messaged you, Anthony,  like a bunch of times.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Never got a message back.  I bet you messaged him  before me  because he's Anthony.  No, I didn't know.  I actually messaged him  saying, you know.  What did you message?  I said that I have  this week off.  I usually can't call in  and I had this week off  and I was going to call in  and you never...  Boring!  And you said,  yeah, you were saying  your message was that  you had the week off,  right?  Yeah, I remember that. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I don't get  my instant messages.  Of course you don't.  I'd lose respect for you  if you did.  So, what kind of work  do you do?  I work at a school.  A teacher  or a custodian?  Um, uh, a teacher.  Why are we still talking?  Rub that snatch.  Ah, rub that snatch.  All right, you want to play  Guess What's in My Pants, eh?  I do.  All right.  You don't have a  MySpace account, do you?  I do.  You do? 
[01:12:00]  I do.  And a camera?  Um, I have a digital camera  but not a...  A pal talk, I'm sorry.  You have a pal talk?  We're pal talking  like crazy these days.  I don't have pal talk yet.  I do want to get a, uh,  a regular, uh, webcam  so that I can do that.  I have a Logitech  that follows your movement  which I haven't used yet  but those,  I have a great camera.  You have one that  follows your movement?  Yeah, it's, uh,  it was a good one.  I mean, you put on,  you put on like a little stand  if you want to.  It really bugs me.  Why?  Because you have a better  camera than me. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, it's fantastic.  If I go to the left,  if I do this,  the old robot tick to the left,  it will follow my head.  I don't set it for that.  I don't set it for that  but I could.  Well, now I need one.  I can walk around  like Gordon Gekko  just kind of talking  and it will follow me  because it knows.  I like that.  Oh, there's a picture  of you on all fours  on your little bedspread.  You're very pretty.  And your cleavage  is showing there.  Very nice.  Are you a married gal,  are you?  I'm very involved. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Involved.  I don't know what that means.  I have a boyfriend  of three years.  You're saying you have  a gentleman caller.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, that's all about  he may be listening right now.  No, but she's...  No, actually,  I can see him.  He's in bed right now.  Ooh.  What's he wearing?  You want to come over, Jimmy?  Oh, hubba hubba.  Got a hot tub, do you?  A little footsie.  All right, you're a teacher. 
[01:13:30]  You're 24 years old.  We've seen your pictures.  I think it's time to play  Guess What's In My Pants.  All right, let's go.  Are we going to play any music?  Jingles.  We'll just get right to it.  Wow.  Hold on, sweetie.  We need a jingle.  All right.  That would have been a good  opportunity to play it.  Instead of me talking over it.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Derek can take a cue. 
[01:14:00]  Place the receiver  upon your beaver.  It's time to play  Guess What's In My Pants.  What's the time?  What's the time?  Guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  For all the brand new listeners  of the Open Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio,  Anthony, how do we play  Guess What's In My Pants?  Oh, one of the most fun games  we play here on the  Open Anthony show.  Absolutely.  This proves that we're  brilliant broadcasters. 
[01:14:30]  What Kara is going to do  is take her telephone  and rub it on her most  intimate of region,  that snatch area.  Can I interrupt you  for one second?  Yes, of course.  What is this game for?  But interrupting.  We do it every time.  I know.  But the listeners,  I think they're a little  smarter than us today.  They're coming up with  all the lines that  we should be coming up with.  That we're missing.  Bruce in Louisiana.  Go ahead.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Bruce.  I said that in advance 
[01:15:00]  because I'm going to tell you  what involved means.  It means won't fuck Jimmy.  You know what?  I actually did think of that  and I have to agree.  It does mean that.  And Bruce,  thanks for the old time.  I'm, let's just say,  very involved in not fucking Jimmy.  It's a new project  called Don't Fuck a Jimmy.  I'm committed enough  not to give you any pussy.  All right,  so where were we, Anthony?  The game.  Explaining the game.  Kara is going to rub that phone  on her region, 
[01:15:30]  her nether region.  Is there hair there?  Is there not?  Who knows?  That's what we have to determine.  Right.  She will rub it up and down,  side to side,  and in the all-important  circular motion.  Can I interrupt you again?  Of course.  Yes, go ahead.  I just wanted to say this.  Just wanted to interrupt me.  I thought so.  I thought so.  I was going to say no, too.  Damn it.  That's right.  I suck.  She said,  on behalf of the listeners,  I'd appreciate it.  Right.  On behalf.  I like representing everybody. 
[01:16:00]  And I did throw my hand out  like I was delivering a line.  On behalf of the audience  in the theater.  You can't see, Anthony.  He's got one hand on his chest  and the other hand out  like he's making  an important speech.  Outstretched.  People of the theater,  I implore you.  At this point,  he's holding a skull.  I don't know what that means,  but, uh...  It's Uric.  Shakes queer.  Shakes queer.  Alas, loud teens.  He's talking up to a balcony right now. 
[01:16:30]  We don't know why.  You should just be talking  into the mic, Anthony.  He's like that lady  who's telling everybody  to applaud for John Merrick  in the theater.  Yes.  On behalf of the theater,  clap for that fucking  turnip-roof-stone.  Usher!  Usher!  Where for are thou?  Usher!  Please remove  these children,  these noisy youths,  on behalf of...  I do stink.  No, you don't.  You're just a bully.  I wanted to watch... 
[01:17:00]  Three hours?  I wasn't going to sit there  for three hours  listening to that crap.  If they were black,  you would have.  You are absolutely right.  If they were black in 17  and all wearing  either blue or red visors.  FUBU shirts?  Yeah.  You would have said,  hey...  All over.  We better go to another theater.  The oversized white T-shirts.  Yeah.  One of the hottest styles  in the hood.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Like you know.  He does.  He's always up on that stuff.  Oh.  I know shit.  He's got cheddar.  I'll get ten fucking people  to back me up on that one. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  It's all about  the long, oversized  white T-shirts.  Yes.  I never see...  Even saw that  in the Cayman Islands.  The trend even hit  the Cayman Islands.  They're not wearing that  in Great Neck.  I'm not seeing it  in Great Neck.  Of course you're not.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right, Cara.  What she will do  is rub the phone.  Blah, blah, blah.  We must guess  what type of hairstyle  she has.  Here are your choices  for the people listening  at home and for us  here in the studio.  Yes, Cara. 
[01:18:00]  You are not to reveal  what you have down there  until we ask you  what is in your pants.  All right.  All right, people.  Your choices.  The standard issue  female triangle.  This is your basic  thatch, patch of hair.  It could be shaved down a bit  and kept like landscaped a bit,  you know,  but still the natural shape  of a triangle  that the pube grows in.  Or next,  we have the mohawk. 
[01:18:30]  This is common  amongst a lot of strippers.  They shave it in  from the thighs inward,  leaving a mohawk  also updated  to the landing strip,  they call it,  because it looks like  a little landing strip.  Next,  the Hitler mustache.  This is a ridiculous  looking way to shave.  It's a small tuft of hair  resembling Hitler's mustache  just over the,  where the,  all that muck and mire 
[01:19:00]  start down there,  you know.  It looks okay  when the legs  are closed together.  Once they open it up,  it looks very silly.  You're saying that  it looks like,  right before the whole mess,  it looks like a welcome mat  in the beginning  of the La Brea Tar Pit.  You've put it perfectly.  We'll use that  from now on.  And of course,  we can't forget  all the rage these days.  Completely shaved.  Just slick.  Nothing there. 
[01:19:30]  The JonBenet Ramsey  as we like to call it.  Which is always the favorite.  Yes.  Or,  the other name  it has gotten over  the course of the year,  the Conor Peterson armpit.  That's right.  Just so hairless.  And wet.  All right.  Are we ready?  I am ready.  Kara,  you're naked?  I have a tank top on.  That's it.  That's fine.  Oh.  She needs direction. 
[01:20:00]  You're naked?  Yeah.  You're naked?  Yeah.  Now I am.  All right.  Take the phone,  please.  And go up  and down  a few times.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let's listen.  All right.  Side to side?  Side to side,  please.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:20:30]  And circular motion  a few times.  All right.  Here you go.  All right.  I hear  wispy.  I need  side to side  again.  Okay.  Here you go.  Yeah.  Very telling.  All right.  Very telling.  All right.  I got it.  Very telling.  I got it. 
[01:21:00]  Go ahead,  Anthony.  I'm going to say  mohawk.  Landing strip.  Yeah.  Landing strip.  Mohawk.  Nope.  Opus going off the map here.  Greg says no.  No,  it's a wood floor.  You're saying wood floor.  She hasn't had time to shave yet.  But we were just hearing,  what was that thing we were hearing  in the middle?  Was that a little  flesh slap  going on on the phone?  Yeah.  The phone kind of got stuck  for a second.  Yeah.  That is a deceiving part  of the side to side. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Well,  we've guessed here in the studio.  You've guessed at home,  I'm sure.  It is now time to reveal.  Cara,  what indeed do you have  in your pants?  Opie,  you are exactly right.  Again.  I'm on a winning streak,  by the way.  Wow.  I was going to say wood floor.  I wasn't.  Actually,  that trip was my first.  That side to side got me  awesome.  Well,  I shaved yesterday  because I was calling in,  but since I didn't get through. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  See,  that's the problem  with this game.  A lot of the women  are tricking us  because they're not shaving  before they play the game.  If that's their hairstyle,  they're not shaving it,  so there's a little growth  from the day before  and it's fucking up everything.  Yeah.  So you've got to have  really good ears,  which I don't have.  I'm just guessing.  Do you have,  do you have  what they call  a hubba-bubba?  What's that?  It's a little,  just a little bit  of hubba-bubba.  Kind of,  you know,  like bubble gum.  What he's saying is this, 
[01:22:30]  does your vag,  and he's trying to say it nicely,  does it look like,  like have you ever seen  what happens  to someone's intestines  when a truck  runs over their stomach,  the way they kind of  shoot out of the asshole?  I mean,  that's not the nicest description,  but he's saying  there's that kind of...  Way to make it sound  sexy for everybody,  Jimmy.  No,  no,  it's fine.  Yeah,  all nice and neat.  All right.  Of course.  Like,  you know when you get clams?  Yep.  And they're nice  and cold  and tight 
[01:23:00]  and you have to  shuck them  and it's really difficult  because they're tight,  but then there's  that one clam  that just is like,  blah,  it's kind of,  everything's hanging out of it.  All you need  is a butter knife  to open it up.  The edges of it  are black.  You just put the  butter knife to it  and it just falls apart.  Oh, it falls apart.  That's what I like.  It goes,  it's gone a little oof.  And then you're  spending time  trying to push it  all back up  into the towel  before you eat it.  All frilly  and you're not like that,  right? 
[01:23:30]  No,  no,  she's blonde,  24 years old.  Yep.  She's very pretty.  I'm getting all these  messages on my face  of people guessing now.  Very good,  very good.  Look at that.  Hope he had it again.  He is on a winning streak.  Very good job.  Is there anything else  we could do with you today?  What do you guys want to do?  I wanted to call in  for a long time.  Well,  you know,  couples have sex  on our show.  We've had drill does  and all sorts  of sex toys.  Well,  I would like to call in again. 
[01:24:00]  Maybe I can call in again  later on this week.  All right.  She's great.  I think we're done  with you then,  Kara.  Thank you so much  for playing  Guess What's in My Pants.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, Kara.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey,  Guess What's in My Pants.  Place the receiver  upon your beaver.  It's time to play  Guess What's in My Pants. 
[01:24:30]  It's time  to guess  What's in My Pants.  My Pants.  What a great game.  Yes, it was.  And Opie again winning.  Wow.  I was on a hot streak  for a long time  and then I went away.  We all have our little streaks  and Opie's riding high on his.  Enjoy it, my friend.  I'm doing all right.  I'm doing all right.  Enjoy it, my friend.  Well, we started by talking  about Jack Black and King Kong  so why don't we play  this Jack Black song?  I never heard Tenacious D, actually.  Right?  That's who it is, right?  Is this officially  a Tenacious D song? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Kick in the Sea?  Yeah.  All right.  Check this out.  Oh, there are several ways  to irritate a lady.  You could mention  that her act's  gone out of style.  Oh, that's sure  to get a nift.  It's bound to cause a tiff.  But here's a little trick  to go the extra mile.  Give her just a little  kick in the cunt.  Kick in the cunt? 
[01:25:30]  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a nice  kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stunt  if you go for the punt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Now, a lady of grace  will show utter distaste  for a slur  or a randy suggestion.  But if you call her a whore,  it may do nothing more  than make a subtle change  in her complexion.  So give her a kick in the cunt. 
[01:26:00]  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a lovely  kick in the cunt, eh?  If you aim to annoy,  there's no better ploy  than a rousing  good kick in the cunt.  Now, you might want a sucker  or clopping the choppers,  a sucker for making  a grabber and knockers,  but she'll call the coppers  and you'll in the jail  where you eat bread and water  and shit in a pail.  So if you've enough  of a womanly guff,  no need to be rough,  it'll be quite enough  to call her block  with a huff and a puff  to snuff your foot straight 
[01:26:30]  into the muff.  Just a no-fashioned  kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt.  As about a nice  kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stump  when you go for the hunt  with a jolly good  kick in the cunt.  Ben's hog is just  big enough for my baby.  Well, I do have big tits,  goddammit.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:27:00]  Okay, terrific.  Let's do it!  You're checking out  the Opian Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio.  If you like what you hear,  you tell a friend.  That's the ONA virus at work.  We will rule 
[01:27:30]  Satellite Radio.  That is a promise.  Got some good stories  in the news today.  Hear about this  Alaska Airlines  cabin pressure scare thing.  Little problem  with one of their planes.  Why would anyone  fly them?  I've heard they're good,  but I would never get  on a plane  with a fucking  Eskimos picture on it.  Yeah, a big Eskimo  on the tail. 
[01:28:00]  Didn't Jake LaMotta  lose his son to that?  No, I believe  that was Swiss Air.  Oh, is it Swiss Air?  I think so.  I thought it was  Alaska Airlines.  No, I think it was Swiss Air.  Swiss Air?  Okay.  Well, here's the audio  and then we'll comment.  20 minutes after takeoff  at 26,000 feet,  Alaska Airlines flight 536  suddenly plunges.  Our ears are just  in the top of the air  and it's painful.  The oxygen masks drop.  There's a funny odor.  She's just telling us  that the smell  that we're smelling 
[01:28:30]  is the gas  from when the oxygen mask  came down.  Flight attendants  quickly try to calm  the 140 terrified people  on board.  We just had a very fun moment  where the cabin  depressurized.  Are you recording that?  Yes.  It wasn't fun, huh?  He was recording what?  I guess he just had his  video camera going.  So they had some 
[01:29:00]  eyewitness accounts  but the reason this all  happened is really,  really good.  Yeah, oops.  Really good.  Listen to this.  Even more frightening,  the 6 by 12 inch hole  that caused the pressure loss.  A ground worker now admits  he punctured the fuselage  and didn't tell anyone  before takeoff.  When he was putting equipment  up to the aircraft  in preparation of moving baggage  that he contacted  the aircraft improperly  and just kind of creased it.  There is high praise  for the pilot  who immediately headed back 
[01:29:30]  to Seattle's Sea-Tac Airport  for an emergency landing.  Welcome to Seattle.  Especially grateful  were those on board.  Could you imagine?  What a fucking piece of shit.  Asshole.  We've all done something  like that where you maybe  break something  and no one's looking  and you're like,  I don't want to deal with this  so you just kind of sneak away.  You know,  but this guy did it to a plane.  I talked about that one time  I was installing something  over a bathtub  with a drill 
[01:30:00]  and it had a Phillips head  screw attachment in there  and I was drilling  some Phillips head screws  above a bathtub  and I dropped the drill  and it fell  Phillips head screw  first  and went right  through the bathtub.  Put a hole  in the bottom of the bathtub.  Brand new house.  I just put a piece  of cardboard over it  and left the building.  Yeah, well,  if 150 people  decide to bathe at once.  Yeah, that could be  a problem, but.  What a scumbag  to not tell it.  He should be  put in jail for that. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, of course.  He's probably going  to be sued.  Attempted murder.  Murder.  Or some kind of  reckless endangerment.  Yeah, that's right.  What a jerk off.  Yeah.  Pete in Miami.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah, the strange odor  they all smelled  was when everyone  shit their pants  in unisonics together.  Listeners are on  fire today.  Punching out.  You guys rock.  It would cause  a strange odor.  Some days they stink,  but today they're on fire.  They're helping out  big time.  They are helping out  the program.  The program, yes. 
[01:31:00]  So that's one  of the big stories.  And then Jeff Reardon  who played for the Mets  and the Yankees,  he robbed a gym store  for what,  like $200 or something?  Did he play for the Sox, too?  And the Sox.  Did he rob them  or just steal?  Like, did he actually  pull a pistol  or he just...  Well, we got the audio here.  We let the audio  do all our work.  I like that.  And then we just  try to come up  with a one-liner  and then we move on.  That's what we did.  We'll just go,  that's fucked up.  Yeah.  It was robbery. 
[01:31:30]  What, this program  to the listeners?  Yeah.  It's robbery.  Not free.  Yeah, you think  they sit there and go,  you know,  I thought I would get  a little more  for my money.  What the fuck?  Every month  they get a bill  and an apology  from XM.  Like, look,  they're only back on  for 15 months  just to kind of  get their bearings.  Warm up.  They're still getting  the rust out,  you know,  give them time.  You get used to them.  We sort of believe in them.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Former New York Mets  and Yankees pitcher  Jeff Reardon  now accused of robbing  a Florida jewelry store.  Police say he got away  with $170  after handing  an employee a note  that said he had a gun.  Officers later found  Reardon unarmed  at a nearby restaurant.  The all-star blames  his arrest on antidepressants  he's taken  since his son's death  last year.  You gotta think  he doesn't need $170.  That's a heist.  That's some problems.  Yeah.  And you gotta think  he wasn't going  for a lot of money.  He just lost his mind. 
[01:32:30]  I believe him.  Yeah, I kind of  believe him.  I believe him.  He lives in like  a gated community  down there in Florida.  He's doing just fine  in retirement.  Doesn't need  a hundred bucks.  He's on the antidepressants  because he lost his son  and started taking them.  Yeah.  And he just kind of  lost his mind.  But it's on the front page  of the New York paper today.  I saw an overdose  on drugs last year.  Yeah.  Geek.  How do you feel  for the guy?  Yeah, it's gotta  fuck you up a little bit  I'm sure. 
[01:33:00]  He's probably feeling  a little guilty.  And he walks in  with $170.  Leave a jewelry store  with only $170.  Jesus.  Take some gems.  Oh shit.  That's probably  what's gonna save him  in the end.  We joke but  Hey guys,  when are we gonna do  the New Year's resolution bit?  Will we all come up  with our resolutions?  Like I said earlier,  you really don't want  to hear my New Year's resolution.  I do, Opie.  No, you don't.  I know what it is already.  No, you don't. 
[01:33:30]  What?  Be nicer to Jimmy Norton?  I'm nice to Jimmy.  Yeah, I wasn't  gonna say that.  Every once in a while  I have a flare-up,  but in general  I'm nice to Jimmy Norton.  No, but he's nice.  Be nicer to Hawk maybe?  Because Hawk's a...  I've been nice to Hawk.  No.  I've been much better.  No one is nice to Hawk.  Hawk, have I been nicer to you?  Yeah, he's been pretty good.  Thank you.  Let's go.  Thank you.  You don't even load up  a fucking question like that  and launch it. 
[01:34:00]  Way to go, wife with a black eye.  Do you honestly think,  right,  do you honestly think  when you present him  I've been nicer to you,  right,  that he's gonna say  yes or no  or anything  but what he thinks  he should say?  And you didn't see the look  in my eye.  Oh, what was it?  It was evil.  That was basically  yes, I do renounce them.  Yeah.  I do a brainwash thing  around here.  I like it.  Brainwash thing.  I'm gonna tear down  the fifth wall today.  I brainwash a little bit.  I ran into the door again. 
[01:34:30]  I got a black eye.  I ran into the door.  Opie, I sit on this computer  to get away from you.  I'm gonna take a trip  to Algeria.  They have the,  Opie and Eric have that  like Sonny  and his fat wife relationship.  He says to me  look it up on the computer  you fat pig.  I says he's gonna shoot me  to my body in the river.  I'm gonna say  something nice right now.  Oh, this is  the best group  of people  I've ever worked with. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  And he said that  many times  off air  not just to be nice  to the guys  but this is the best crew.  He said that  this is the best crew  by far  and I've been doing  this a really long time  and no one comes close.  Sometimes people wish  some of the old guys  were back here and there  but we really picked  an unbelievable group.  I think I just saw  somebody in that  back room  saying that  it's a fantastic group.  Wow.  I saw thumbs up  and everything.  Almost saw Halo.  We definitely figured it out  this time  I gotta tell you.  We definitely figured it out. 
[01:35:30]  We got a really good  group of people.  Yeah, this week.  No, not really.  Keep them on their toes.  I've believed that  since day one.  You know,  there was a lot of  growing pains and stuff  but these guys  are unbelievable.  They worked their balls  off for us.  Isn't it the only crew  we've ever had?  Really?  No.  We had a whole crew  at NEW.  Nah, those were people  that had other jobs.  We had a crew at AF  for a little while.  Well, not really.  It was just me and you.  The people at NEW  were like 
[01:36:00]  people that had  other jobs.  Like,  Steve wasn't  a part of our crew  but he was part of our crew.  He was a production guy.  Ben was part of our crew.  Was Ben actually  part of our crew?  Rick was part of our crew.  Rick was.  Stinky was part of our crew.  Spaz, who I never really knew.  Spaz was for a while.  Refrancine?  No, we were paying  Spaz for a while.  Yeah, but they were  like interns that  kind of...  These guys start as interns.  Yeah, but they work.  But they work.  That's what I'm saying.  We have the best crew.  Let's just leave it at that.  They're great.  No, I don't want to. 
[01:36:30]  Steve has some problems though.  Steve definitely  has some issues.  I said I want  fucking realistic footsteps  and he brings me  that high-heeled shit.  I don't die.  All right.  In other news,  I was just trying to be nice.  There's no jokes.  These guys have  been unbelievable for us.  Stan has something  for us right now.  One of the stars  have walked in right now.  What do you got for us, Stan?  Stan?  This doesn't have to be 
[01:37:00]  addressed immediately,  but it's the top five  or top ten targets  of late night monologues.  Ooh.  Throughout the year.  I know you like  the old 2005 summaries.  They're kind of a pulse  on what's been going on  in the country.  I don't know if we like it,  but it's a thing to do  at the end of the year  is to kind of take a look  back at the year.  Oh, they do all these  every time.  Top ten late night  joke targets.  So I guess Leno  and Letterman 
[01:37:30]  and Conan  and the rest of them.  Yeah.  If this was just  a Letterman  top ten  late night joke targets,  number one would be  New York City rats.  Oh, New York  and Times Square.  How filthy it is.  Holy fuck.  Full of prostitutes.  Get out of your  fucking limo, Letterman.  I DVR'd his show,  you know,  last night's show,  and sure enough,  the first joke is about  fucking New York City rats.  Really?  Enough with the rat humor.  There's real shit going on  in the world 
[01:38:00]  that you could skew.  But that's safe  and it's not offensive  politically or ideologically  to anybody.  Letterman,  and people don't understand  because they don't visit  New York City a lot,  but Letterman talks about rats.  He talks about the hookers  in Times Square.  I mean,  there's maybe hookers still,  but you don't see them.  That's the last thing  you see in Times Square.  Okay?  Because someone's going to  call me out and go,  no, dude,  if you look closely,  they're still there.  Right.  You don't see them.  It's disconnected.  It's fucking Disneyland  down there, 
[01:38:30]  Disney World,  whatever you want to call it.  Times Square is completely different  and Letterman's still talking  about Times Square  like it's 1979.  It's just safe, dude.  It's amazing how they got,  Letterman got this reputation  for being a really hip guy.  Like,  compared to Carson,  maybe he was.  That was your mom and dad's guy  and Letterman was your younger guy.  He was your guy.  But then,  and all of a sudden,  it's like once Johnny left  and Leno took over  and like,  you know,  Leno does all this racial stuff  and this fucking  Michael Jackson pedophile joke  and you never see that shit  on Letterman.  Nope.  I've really changed the corner 
[01:39:00]  and Jimmy opened my eyes to this  and I'm very disappointed.  I was a huge Letterman guy,  I gotta tell you, man.  But the guy's been just calling in  that freaking TV show  for years now.  For years.  He's a good interviewer  and he's like,  you know,  he's a funny dude  but the monologues,  and people say,  well,  he kind of knows  he's not as good  at the monologue  but it's like,  yeah,  but stop talking about  stupid New York City rats  and how Times Square  has hookers.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  The rats are big.  Are they big, Dave?  Are they big?  Arabs are attacking us.  Exactly. 
[01:39:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Take a peek around a little bit  when you're driving  into New York  in your limo.  You might see  some different things.  My God, man.  So the top ten  late night joke targets,  ten,  Hillary Clinton,  nine,  Harriet Mears,  oh,  she was the nominee,  right,  for the Supreme Court  that went nowhere.  Right.  Eight,  Tom DeLay,  seven,  Saddam Hussein,  six,  Dick Cheney,  fifth,  fifth place,  Martha Stewart,  fourth,  Robert Blake,  three, 
[01:40:00]  Bill Clinton,  two,  Michael Jackson,  and of course,  the president  would be number one.  With 553 jokes about him?  Yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  So that was beyond exciting.  Certainly was.  Hope you enjoyed that one.  I can't wait till next year  when Tham brings a new list in.  You bring me this shit again  and I'll fucking  put my finger in your eye.  Oh,  you were saying  before Tham brought it in?  Yeah.  Best crew ever?  That's right.  That's right.  And in other news, 
[01:40:30]  Sleepy Donut Guy dies.  Who knew he had diabetes?  He shouldn't have been eating the donuts,  obviously.  The donut guy had diabetes.  Time to make the donuts.  That guy,  he's dead.  Jimmy referenced him yesterday,  too,  by the way.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  He referenced  when Lady Di was calling in.  Oh,  yeah.  Then you asked if she was the donut guy.  Oh,  yeah,  because you were the guy from the commercial.  Oh,  my God.  You know what?  We could dress her up like this guy.  Oh,  yeah.  Look just like him.  Look just like him. 
[01:41:00]  He was born in Brooklyn.  He was,  the Breakstone guy.  Oh,  he did a lot of things,  but people will remember him as donut guy.  Dude,  the guy,  like,  he went to acting school  with some very,  uh,  performed on Broadway.  Popular.  Actors and successful,  with Steiger and,  and,  and there he is.  Time to make the donuts.  But the funny part is,  or not the funny part,  but I,  I remember one time,  I saw him when he was in the Marathon Man.  He has one scene in the Marathon Man.  Oh,  yeah.  And,  uh,  they list that as one of his credits, 
[01:41:30]  but it's such a,  it's a scene where he's in the jewelry store.  He works for the jeweler.  Olivier comes in.  He's trying to sell these,  which rather,  he's stolen from Jews during the war,  these jewels.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  the guy's a concentration camp survivor  and kind of recognizes him.  And the guy working with the guy who recognizes him  is this guy.  It's the donut guy.  And then the guy,  and that's the last you see of him.  Yeah.  And then the other guy comes out and goes,  I know you,  you murderer.  And Olivier cuts his throat.  This man needs help.  It's our doctor.  You mean,  I was putting a knife back into his coat? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Drops him on the sidewalk and leaves.  The old lady sees him.  Zell!  Can't hit her.  Zell!  The white angel's here!  Oh,  what a funny movie.  Ben!  Ben!  Ha!  Don't,  don't.  Ah.  The white powder under the nose is here!  Ha!  Ha!  And finally,  we have a creepy story.  Creepy story in the news?  I think so. 
[01:42:30]  New Year's right around the corner  and the stupid local news here  describing the ball  that's going to be dropping in Times Square.  Is it any different  than it has been  for the past,  let's say,  15 years?  Yes.  I know they updated it  maybe 15 years ago.  Is it different?  It has a lump on it.  Ha!  Ha!  It's in a bag this year.  Hovering above Times Square.  When it touches the chin, 
[01:43:00]  it'll be 2006.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Anyway,  here's the story.  It's about good old Dick Clark.  Oh.  Dick Clark's coming back.  Well,  that is being debated.  If you heard about this,  Dick Clark is scheduled to co-host  his New Year's Rockin' Eve show  for four nights from now.  He missed last year  because he'd suffered a stroke.  But some people are wondering  what's going on  because of this publicity photo.  It shows Clark with his co-host  Hillary Duff  and Ryan Seacrest, 
[01:43:30]  but it's a doctored photo.  Clark's picture was taken  before his stroke  and added digitally.  His publicist says  no big deal  that Clark just didn't want  to sit for the photo,  but a lot of people are wondering  are they trying to conceal  his physical condition?  That is such bullshit.  He didn't want to sit for the photo.  Look,  if you're...  He's got a world of hurt  they're trying to cover up.  If you're coming back  from a stroke  to do the show  you have done for...  How many years  has he done this?  Five.  Stop.  Could be more than that, gentlemen.  Could be more than that. 
[01:44:00]  You would want  all the publicity  you can get.  Yeah.  There'd be photo shoots.  You know,  maybe not the rigorous schedule  of someone like Ryan Seacrest  who can wing around,  take pictures,  but, you know,  maybe one fucking shot,  one picture of you.  It's like he's been  real busy all year.  I'm seeing this  as one of two things.  Either he is  really fucked up.  This is what I think.  He's really fucked up.  They don't want  to take pictures of him 
[01:44:30]  because he's fucked up.  They're going to use him  in a very limited capacity  on New Year's Eve.  Or,  he's alright,  enough to do this  where it's not going to look  really fucked up  and it's a publicity stunt.  The big reveal  is going to be  on New Year's Eve  and they want people watching  so they're going to show  and say,  hey,  look,  here he is.  Look at that.  The smile does reach  both sides of the old face.  I think he's going to be  on camera  for less than a minute  and it's going to be  like a tribute  to Dick Clark. 
[01:45:00]  They're going to show  all past footage.  Past clips.  And then they're going to have  it set in such a way  that he doesn't look  that bad.  Where you can just  kind of see like  half his face  in the frame.  Wow.  A big ultra zoom in  on half his face.  He's always peeking  around the corner  talking.  You know what I mean?  Hiding behind a building.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Maybe for New Year's  instead of the ball drop  and they could have  the other side  of his face drop.  Oh, Jesus.  No. 
[01:45:30]  Why are you looking away?  Oh, I like Dick Clark.  I know.  Put Kiss on TV  in the 70s.  I like him.  Five.  Cinderblock.  Three.  Eight.  Chicken Parmesan.  Pound pie.  Dick.  Where's Ben?  Because Ben said  one of the rag magazines  had a picture of Dick Clark.  And he was completely gray  and white hair.  Really?  Was he 76?  I don't know.  He's up there now. 
[01:46:00]  Because you know  they were calling him  the world's oldest teenager  for many years.  He seemed to, I know.  I just don't like  the name of the show  New York.  New Year's Rockin' Eve.  But there's no G in rocking.  It's an N with an apostrophe.  Don't need the G.  It's more rockin'  if it's just a little apostrophe.  That's right.  And they call him  the world's oldest teenager  because he was always  in the music scene  and hip and...  Never seemed to age, Opie. 
[01:46:30]  Kind of like Jean Benet  being the world's  youngest porn star.  Right.  And she will never age.  Why did I have to go to...  Why?  Because you always go there.  Because you're Jimmy Norton.  But I'm sure he was  dyeing his hair.  He didn't have jet black hair  in his 70s.  And then perhaps  with the stroke  and everything,  I don't think he's supposed  to dye your hair.  What, Opie?  Goddamn listeners  are just way better  than us today.  Just steal the line!  I want to so bad.  I really do.  Just pilfer it.  Just pilfer it like it's yours. 
[01:47:00]  Go ahead.  Hang up on him  and pilfer it.  I can't.  Pilfer!  Colin!  DC!  Go ahead.  Watch him fuck it up now.  I know.  Watch him fuck it up.  I just wondered  if Vic Clark  could be known  as half a dick face.  Damn it!  I curse you!  His delivery stunk.  I know.  Your delivery really stunk.  Bill Burr, everyone,  outside the studio.  And I would have preferred  an old half a dick face.  So we'll see  what that's all about.  Bill Burr.  We better roll tape 
[01:47:30]  on the rockin'  New York City.  Oh, please.  I want to see that.  You saw a picture  of Dick Clark  in one of the tabloids?  He was in a walker  with all white hair.  In a walker?  Using a walker.  Oh, using a walker  all white hair?  How long ago?  Like two weeks ago.  How did he...  Was he standing up  in the walker straight?  Was he hunched over?  Hunched over,  head down,  gray hair.  He really looked old.  A lot older than that photo.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  For the first time,  I think I'm going  to have to watch this.  Yep.  How great would it be  if he fell off the stage?  Goddering old man. 
[01:48:00]  He'll be tough  as to jump in  and help him.  He slips and calls her a cunt.  Five, four, cunt.  No.  Stop it, man.  Yeah, he addresses  each one of them by action.  Five, four, cunt.  Shitty show.  Two, one.  We'll all be watching.  Sure.  Rockin'.  Jersey, Nick.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I don't know if you caught  the picture of Parrot Hilton  in today's Daily News 
[01:48:30]  on page 10.  Yeah, she's sunning  in Bali, I believe.  Yeah, but check out  between her legs.  She's got the big,  meaty veal curtain showing.  Where is this?  Good call.  What page?  Nice bulge.  Daily News, page 10.  Check out.  She has a nice,  fat lip bulge.  Good call, sir.  Veal curtains, Jimmy.  I don't know if they're  veal curtains,  but whenever a girl  crosses her legs  like that,  there's going to be  like a little bit  of a bulge  from the bikini bottom.  With your thumb  and your middle finger.  Yeah.  You could see 
[01:49:00]  a lot of anatomy  right there.  My motto is  the bigger the bulge,  the better the person.  Wow.  Nice, big, fat bulge.  That's, uh,  there's been a lot  of cock through there, though.  Yeah, it's not that big, though,  but again,  it's hard to see it  from a distance.  It's really hard to see.  That's a good call.  We'll give it to you.  All right, man.  Thanks, Jersey, Nick.  You bet she's wearing white.  Seen right through it.  All right.  Yeah, just see those  big, juicy lips outlined.  Bill Burr's outside the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while.  So why don't we go to break 
[01:49:30]  and regroup  and we'll talk to Bill.  We'll have him  during the quarter.  I'll see you guys later.  Yes.  What?  Jimmy, you stay.  But I'm scared.  He stayed.  Now, you will have to move seats.  You'll have to go  in the guest seat.  Funny would that be  if you guys moved me over  like Jim Burr say.  Jimmy moved.  Never.  This is going to be weird  for everyone.  I've got to be honest with you.  No, it's not.  It's going to be very strange  for everybody.  No, no, it'll be fine.  Both pals.  It's not like we  weren't kissing Bill Burr's ass  when he was filling in for you.  And now you're here 
[01:50:00]  and we're kissing your ass.  And Opie, I...  There's no...  Bill is a very competent  fill-in guy  when Jimmy is not here.  He's a good boy.  But when Jimmy is here,  it's Jimmy.  I know, but now  they're both here.  A little strange.  I don't know.  I won't interfere.  Watch the fireworks fly next.  Oh, no.  The sparks are going to fly, folks.  New Year's resolutions  coming up. 
[01:50:30]  From Stinko Records,  it's the new collection of covers  from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original golden button.  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk, smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten  most of the lyrics.  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Chews up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady. 
[01:51:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  And spews them back out.  Dirtier, grittier,  and stinkier than farts and...  We're doing a show 
[01:51:30]  within a show.  Bill Burr in studio.  Billy!  Hello, fellas.  Good to see you again, Bill.  What's going on?  Not much, actually.  We're kind of just calling it in.  We got one more show  for this year.  Calling it in.  And we'll regroup for next year.  Another guy jacking off  on the camera  had to be booted out of the room.  What's going on with that?  We're on Pal Talk,  as you know.  We got well over 100 
[01:52:00]  and some odd people  in this room here right now.  A lot on camera.  But sometimes guys will come in  and I don't know.  They don't know the gist of the room.  They see a couple of girls  and decide it's time  to pull their pants down,  put the camera on their cock  and jerk off.  Jacking.  And just start jacking off.  There's about 800 listeners  trying to get it up right now.  Yeah.  Going to try to...  Oh, get on here.  Yes.  No, they will be booted.  This is not a jacking... 
[01:52:30]  There are plenty of jacking sites  you can go to on Pal Talk  if that's what you're into.  I'm sure Jimmy Norton,  you could find his name on there  on a nightly basis.  Yeah, Jim's done a little whacking  in one of the rooms.  Like, I don't want anybody  to know who I am  as the appendix scar.  Fat stomach in my name.  Fucking master reality CD  in my thigh.  See some little stones  in the corner of the room  in the hallway.  There's some celebrity photos  in the background.  I was going to say,  yeah, there's a wall of fame 
[01:53:00]  in the background.  Damn it, you got me.  Who's all those celebrities  with that lesbian?  Let's go to Mississippi.  We don't get calls  from Mississippi often.  Reno.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  What's up, Reno?  Great, great.  Man, new listener  to the XM radio,  Opie and Anthony,  Bill Burr, and Jimmy,  you guys made me laugh  all the way to work.  Just wanted to tell you guys  you're great.  How long have you been  listening to the program?  Probably about a month.  Oh, cool, man.  Tell your friends.  Yeah, we got to say hi 
[01:53:30]  to all the new listeners.  A lot of people got XM  for Christmas,  and they're just checking out  the show for the first time.  So, welcome aboard.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  You guys have a great day.  All right, Reno.  Thank you.  Yeah, we shouldn't even be working,  but the satellite radio thing,  everyone's opening up  their Christmas presents,  they got the XM,  they're getting it hooked up,  so they want to hear  something live,  so here we are.  You're not going to hear  much live radio this week.  In general?  Yeah.  No.  A lot of people go best of.  There you go.  Not us. 
[01:54:00]  Not us.  Troopers in here working.  I can't even get  phoning it in.  Right, phoning it in  for the people.  I can't even get  my apartment painted.  I want to get  my gay color taken out,  because the building  won't allow any construction.  Building won't allow it.  Won't allow it.  Hey, this is too bad.  This just came in.  Comedian Mitch Hedberg  died accidentally  in March of multiple  drug toxicity,  including cocaine and heroin.  Eek.  Spin Magazine reports  cited reports  filed by the New Jersey  Medical Examiner's Office. 
[01:54:30]  This is different,  because a lot of people  believe that he died  of a heart attack  or a heart failure.  Who believed that?  No one in the comedy industry.  No one that knew Mitch  believed it.  This is right up there  where Kennedy was shot.  We owe me no shit.  Well, that was the story  they were telling  everyone at the time,  but it's official.  It was an overdose.  Cocaine and heroin.  Coke and heroin.  How many people  has that taken out?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I know.  37 died in a hotel room  in Livingston, New Jersey.  A couple days after I met him, 
[01:55:00]  which was creepy,  he was ready  to come on our show.  Gave me a big hug  backstage at Caroline's.  Had a great set,  and we exchanged numbers,  and we were going  to get him on the show  like that Monday  or that Tuesday.  And I think he died  the next day, actually.  They actually quote Maureen.  Who's Maureen?  My ex-manager,  and I don't know  if Adam and her  are still dating,  but she's a comedy manager.  It's a very lonely existence,  Taron said.  Taron is Maureen Taron.  If you aren't born  with manic depression,  you will have it  after being in this business. 
[01:55:30]  Ooh.  Wow.  That's uplifting.  That's true.  Hey, join the wonderful  world of comedy.  I know.  You'll love it.  It's no punchline,  you know.  You're all a bunch of creeps.  That was a realistic film.  Oh, punchline?  Ugh.  Sally Field wins  the big contest.  Of course she does.  That was the part  that was realistic.  Yeah, you know what?  You're right.  That is the part  that was realistic.  Character.  I'm a housewife.  That was such a hack.  That husband writes the jokes.  Such a hack movie,  that punchline. 
[01:56:00]  That was awful.  Tom Hanks is crying on stage,  and everybody's moved,  and Barry Sobel  is still working.  It's fucking awful.  Barry Sobel.  Awful.  Awful.  But I am.  I don't know.  I love the guy,  we need laughers tonight.  The old guy they wouldn't  put in the contest.  He's like,  I'm not on the list.  They're like,  we need laughers.  Like they made the old man  sit in the audience.  Oh.  That's what they should.  That's where Keith Robinson's  at pretty much.  That's where they are.  Hey, speaking of comedy,  we got some audio  of Club Soda Kenny  doing stand-up 
[01:56:30]  at the Cringe Humor Show.  That happened  a couple weeks ago.  Good.  And I hear he killed  on stage, so.  Did he?  What are you laughing at?  Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  It's Kenny.  What?  No, I missed something.  Yeah, he killed.  Oh, you thought I was  laughing at both sandwiches?  Yeah, I didn't know  what you were,  that's fine.  I just looked at it  and I'm laughing  and noticed it looks good.  All of a sudden  I wouldn't take a bite.  I know.  Like you guys fucking did so.  No, I was confused,  that's all.  I'm sorry.  Okay, so it's  Club Soda Kenny  at the Cringe Humor Show.  Let's take a little listen here. 
[01:57:00]  Alright, coming to the stage  is the man you'll hear  on the Opie and Anthony show  almost every day.  Put your hands together  from Mr. Club Soda Kenny.  Every day.  Every day.  I love the people  that use this show  as their credits.  Every day?  Hear them on the show  almost every day?  There are advertisements  for comedians and stuff  in local papers  or you'll hear a commercial  on a radio show  or something  and their credit is  that they're regular  on our show  and I don't even know  the guy's name.  I'm like,  maybe we had him on  like one time 
[01:57:30]  like years ago.  That's your fucking credit.  I know, but it's strange.  You have to exaggerate  any credit you have.  Yeah, any credit you read  or see for a comic  is so exaggerated.  There are some  that you see, you know,  as seen on the Tonight Show  and they mean with Carson  like it was that long ago.  You know what I like  the guys who  they'll say  this guy has written  for the Tonight Show  and all it means  is that he's submitted  jokes that they've  turned down.  Seriously.  He just writes them in  and they never use them. 
[01:58:00]  I wrote for the show.  Yeah.  The best example of that  is Bob Gullab  who's a comic friend of ours  still says in his intro  was seen in Goodfellas.  Are you kidding?  You know Bob Gullab.  Yeah.  Here's Bob Gullab  in Goodfellas.  Hey, you got a phone?  Two niggers  just stole my truck.  Yeah, that guy.  That's Bob Gullab.  He's a comic in the diner  and he...  And he was on screen  for what, five seconds?  Or did he have more?  Slow it down.  Really?  Yeah, it was just  a quick one line.  It was a funny line  but he's at his credits.  Well, what's his name  from Scarface? 
[01:58:30]  Angel Salazar.  Yeah.  He had a real part though.  At least Angel  had a real part  in that car.  Yeah, but to still use it?  Good point.  He actually had  his character had a name.  Yeah.  That's another big one.  It's big if your character  had a name.  Guy driving truck.  You're not just  surly truck driver  in Spider-Man.  That's how you know  you're a nobody  when you're named  after your job.  Guy who?  Guy with mop.  Guy with mop.  Worse to be guy  with mop number two.  Yeah, second guy. 
[01:59:00]  Guy who caused mess  that mop man needed  to clean up  as I slink out.  That's number four.  Let's listen to Kenny.  Wow.  Big intro.  Exactly.  Walking on his hands.  From Jersey?  You only wanted me  to talk for five minutes  so why are you  playing the music  so long?  Oh, you addressed it. 
[01:59:30]  Not in a very funny way.  I want to thank Patrick  for inviting me down.  It's the holiday season.  Is everybody enjoying  the show so far?  Well, that'll change  drastically now.  Thank you.  In case anybody  doesn't know it,  I'm married.  And let me tell you,  I'd rather eat my own shit  than be married.  My wife is always telling me 
[02:00:00]  I don't spend enough  quality time with her.  So I tied up her hands  and feet  and I jerked off  on her nose.  I like it.  And then I pistol whipped her  and fucked her in the ass.  Normally,  I don't bother with my wife.  I usually just jerk off  on her pillow  just to let her know  I'm around.  All right.  Hold on.  There's a theme here.  This is killing?  Yeah.  Who said killing? 
[02:00:30]  I heard  Club Soda Kenny  did some stand-up  and I heard he killed.  Here's the review.  Club Soda Kenny  and One Show Crony  and Meet the Creeps  legend stopped by  the December  Cringe Humor Show  and proceeded to violate  everyone in the audience,  building out rape  and pedophile joke  one after another.  Kenny's performance  will go down  as one of the most  cringeworthy sets  in show history.  That cringeworthy  does not mean kill.  Yes, it does.  This guy's a regular  on this show  and when he goes on stage 
[02:01:00]  he kills.  He is not killing.  Well, let's listen  further here.  It may pick up.  That's because  the last time  my wife said yes to me  is when I proposed.  That should be a set-up, Kenny.  My wife is always  telling me  that I'm not romantic  so to get back at her  I fucked her dog.  I'm not gay or nothing  it was a female dog.  That didn't even make sense.  And I know  what you're thinking 
[02:01:30]  like I could have  fucked her best friend  to get even with her  but believe me  the dog was  the better choice.  And recently  I asked my wife  to get her belly button  pierced  this way  I would have  some place  to hang an air freshener.  Wow.  Oh, he's getting  You get it?  Her cunt stinks.  How does he go home 
[02:02:00]  after this set?  Oh, he probably figured  it wouldn't be played  on a national radio show.  Yeah, that's true.  You used to be safe,  you know,  regular radio  can't play this.  No.  Club Sotokani.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  Hello, everybody.  We're in the middle  of critiquing your set.  Well, I can't understand  the unwind of the tension.  It sounds like  you had a wild set  down there.  Well, you know,  it was the holiday season  so I thought 
[02:02:30]  I'd give everybody  a treat.  Wow, you are  pretty rank.  Pretty raw.  But, you know,  overall it wasn't bad.  Like, the white stuff  went over pretty good.  But once I started  with the rape  and the pedophile stuff,  then it was down  from there.  Yeah.  That's surprising.  We got more  of your stand-up,  so you guys  want to hear it?  Do I?  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, hold on there,  Kenny.  I want this on CD.  Before my wife,  I was engaged  to a girl  with a wooden leg, 
[02:03:00]  but I broke it off.  That's clean.  And you know  what else is annoying?  The only time  my wife stops talking  is when her mother starts.  But I guess  I really shouldn't  complain about my wife.  She really is  the perfect woman.  I mean,  what other wife  would lick your asshole  while you fuck her mother?  Did you hear that guy  just go,  oh!  He recoiled.  And they're all 
[02:03:30]  giving you a chance.  They want to like you.  I like how they didn't  give him anything  on that first  mother-in-law joke.  Right.  It was like from  1955 Honeymooners joke.  Yeah, the mother-in-law!  Yeah.  The old battle axe  came over last night.  This guy writes  for Henny Youngman.  Yeah, yeah.  The next guy  coming to the stage.  He sounds a little bit  like Rupert Pumpkin  in his...  Rupert Pumpkin!  Take my wife's cunt,  please.  I've got that  same delivery  as Rupert. 
[02:04:00]  Ma!  And I know  I'm a bad husband  because I cheat  on my wife.  Like one time  I met this girl  and she was so horny  all she wanted  to do was fuck.  And then I found  out her nickname  was Robocunt.  And then last night  I met this Filipino girl  but by the end  of the night  she wasn't Filipino.  She was Filipinas.  I filled her belly button 
[02:04:30]  up with so much cum  that it sank.  I turned her pussy  into a Snickers bar.  It was packed  with penis.  Oh man, Kenny.  I got flop sweat.  I like how your set  has a dynamic.  It has its highs  and its low point.  Like you started out  people were  not like laughing  or applauding  but they were reacting.  Now you've reached  that point  in the dynamic  where they're just 
[02:05:00]  not even acknowledging  you're up there.  I got reaction.  People don't understand  seriously  I don't do this  for a living  I just do it  as a goof  to entertain my friends.  And the audience  isn't mic'd.  Like even on the big laughs  you can hear them  in the background.  Yeah.  So there probably  are some laughs  that we're not hearing  because the audience  isn't mic'd.  All right.  There's like 100 people there.  Plus the guy  he's walking the line here.  This is what happens.  Yeah.  When you take chances  on that.  Kenny's working 
[02:05:30]  a little blue.  Just a little tad.  A little blue.  I would love to hear  a club server  Kenny do the  aristocrats joke.  This is PD13.  His version  of the aristocrats joke.  I want to see Kenny  go up and do  these jokes clean.  I want to see  all the profanity removed.  Yeah.  That would be  a very interesting set.  Let's get back  to the set here.  One time I went out  with this girl  that worked at  the International  House of Pancakes  and when she got  done with work  I hop on her ass. 
[02:06:00]  But I'm glad to see  we got some good  looking chicks  here tonight.  I hop?  You're a really hot chick.  Uh oh.  You're so hot  I bet when you were born  you burnt your mother's  pussy hairs coming out.  And speaking of childbirth  does the clitoris  act like a speed bump  when the kid is born?  That was a segue.  And she's got  big chicks too  in case she didn't see them.  I have a question for that.  You got nothing  on that one.  Well it doesn't make sense.  What is she giving birth  on her head?  How does that work? 
[02:06:30]  Do you know  the female anatomy?  Kenny?  Me?  Yeah, the clitoris doesn't  it's not in the place  where a speed bump  would be for a child  coming out.  Yeah, the baby would  bump the front of his forehead.  I don't know.  It's like comedy.  Something like it  in that it is spoken.  Yes.  There's a microphone involved.  How do you fix that joke?  What if you had her  slide down the taint  and fall into the asshole?  I like that.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:07:00]  There you go.  Free.  Free.  Free advice for you.  Bring it up to the stage.  You can use that.  He wrote for Club Soda Kenny.  Bill Burl.  Let's give him a big hand.  Let's continue here.  I like a chick  that comes with  standard airbags.  You're really hot, though.  You look like good eats.  I bet you  your cunt's so spreadable  it's incredible.  You know what also works,  what he's doing here? 
[02:07:30]  Any slogan  from commercials  that are 25  or 30 years old,  that's really  going to get  the crowd going.  So spreadable,  it's incredible.  Isn't that  some kind of  craft product  or peanut butter?  What used  that slogan,  Club Soda?  Hey, nobody said  I was like  topical  at current events.  You're like  speedy Alka-Seltzer,  lady.  Yeah,  it's not nice  to rape Mother Nature. 
[02:08:00]  I can't believe  I fucked  the whole thing.  I'd like to have  a cunt and a smile  and keep me company.  I'm writing this all down.  Hold on,  I gotta write this down.  Holy shit.  She's got  ring around the asshole.  Time to make  the goo. 
[02:08:30]  That's the difference.  You guys are funny.  I'm a rapist,  he's a rapist,  you're a rapist,  we're all rapists,  you like to be  a rapist too.  How about something  from this decade  at least?  I personally love  the RoboCop joke.  Yeah,  the RoboCop.  God,  I wish I could remember  more Nick at Night  commercials right now.  That's all I'm thinking of.  All I have is  you sank my battleship  and I don't know  how to make it dirty. 
[02:09:00]  How do you fit that in?  You sank my cunt.  How's that?  There you go.  You would say that.  That's all yours.  Take it.  That's a freebie.  Enjoy.  Spreadable.  It's incredible.  Sometimes you feel  like a cunt.  There we go.  I knew there was one in there.  Good stuff, Kenny.  Let's see  what happens next here.  Now he's going to be middling. 
[02:09:30]  This one over here  looks like my old girlfriend,  Chlamydia.  She had a cunt  like a catcher's mitt.  One time  when I was fingering her  she was complaining  about my ring  and I said,  Honey, that's not my ring.  That's my wristwatch.  All right.  That's a good one.  All right.  I'm giving him that one.  Do you know what makes me funny?  It makes me funny  because he said wristwatch.  Yes.  Wristwatch.  Wristwatch.  As opposed to a pocket watch  that I wear 
[02:10:00]  when the covered wagon  comes up.  Honey, that's my timepiece.  I'm fucking her.  I'm like,  Honey, that's my sundial.  That's my stonehenge.  This woman wanted to fuck.  I didn't even have time  to take off my spats.  I'm fingering her  at the White's Only Water Fountain. 
[02:10:30]  But Kenny's getting laughs, though.  He's getting laughs.  He certainly is.  You know how many hickeys  are under this ascot?  Jimmy just did a spit take.  Tommy, Kentucky.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a skinny joke for you.  Yeah.  Ho, ho, ho.  Spill the pussy.  Spill the pussy.  Spill the pussy. 
[02:11:00]  Spill the pussy.  Spill the pussy.  I'm not going to pay a lot  for that pussy.  Zombie, North Carolina.  Hey, he forgot  the most important one.  Where's the beef?  Yeah, but you got to put it in.  Oh, forget it.  Where's the beef curtains?  That's funny.  There you go.  All right.  Let's get back to  Club Soda Kenny's stand-up.  And you know what else?  She had stretch marks  all over her stomach,  but they used to come in handy  because when I'd come on her belly, 
[02:11:30]  they'd act like sperm gutters.  Oh, they'd come on.  And let me ask you.  Sperm gutters?  I've never heard that.  If you come on a chick's belly  and she rubs it in on her tits,  does that make her marriage material?  What?  Did you ever notice?  And you know what else  I got to know?  Is it polite  to drop a load  on a chick's leg  while you eat her ass?  Is that polite?  Because you know my motto?  Haste makes paste. 
[02:12:00]  What?  A bird in the hand  is worth doing your bush.  He's like an old-timey guy.  He's a Borscht Belt comic.  I like the way  he gets louder as it comes.  And then at a punchline.  It just gets really loud  at the punchline.  Don't be penny wise  and cunt foolish.  Anthony in Jersey.  A penny saved  is a pussy burned. 
[02:12:30]  Anthony in Jersey.  Hey, honey,  you're cunt like a Toyota.  Oh, what a feeling.  Melting your mouth  not in your cunt.  Oh,  what are the commercials?  Why can't I remember?  What are you writing,  fan?  All right.  All right.  A stitch in time 
[02:13:00]  will save you behind.  Brian in Ohio.  Brian?  Yeah,  how many licks  does it take  to get to the center  of a uterus?  It goes downstairs.  I eat cunt hairs  while I make  a slurpity sound.  My act is stinky.  It's stinky.  Leave off the last 
[02:13:30]  S for syphilis.  That's Chester's liver  from Whack Bag.  My wrist watch.  You are how old  are you,  can't you?  Commercial references.  That's because  that's how old  that joke is.  Who's got the best  darn pussy  in the whole wide world?  Let's go to Dr. D.  Dr. D.  Speak softly 
[02:14:00]  and carry a big dick.  Ah, Florida.  Sean, what's up?  Honey, you are  finger-fucking-good.  Very good.  It plumps when you suck it.  Candy's cock.  Ben in Virginia.  Ben.  I can't believe  I ate the whole tank.  My pussy has a second name. 
[02:14:30]  It's M-E-Y-E-R.  Plop, plop, jizz, jizz.  Oh, what a relief it is.  Come on, people.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  Come on, 1972.  You remember?  Very funny, Kenny.  It gets much worse.  Oh, yeah.  We got the third part.  This is the, uh,  this is where it turns ugly, right? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, hold on, man.  Todd has a question.  Yes, Todd.  Todd?  What would you do  for a Klondike cunt?  I gave it to us  seven times  up the ass.  The un-colon.  Randy from Staten Island.  Yo.  The best part of waking up 
[02:15:30]  is bulges on your cunt.  You're a little dirty, Kenny.  A little dirty.  And a little old.  I hope you can write real fast  because this is A material.  It's all good stuff for you.  All good stuff.  Yeah, I know.  It's terrific.  This is going to be just as good  as Dice's nursery rhymes.  This is your thing now, Kenny.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  You want to hear more of this?  Oh, absolutely.  It's a couple more minutes.  Drink semen first. 
[02:16:00]  Let's get a mic along.  145 malt liquor.  Mike?  Yeah, what's up?  Please don't fuck the pussy.  Go ahead, Mike.  Okay, sure.  Crazy Kenny, his pussy's insane.  Mr. Nipple.  Stan gave me one. 
[02:16:30]  Lego my cunt-o.  That's funny.  Why did you give me that one?  That was fantastic.  That certainly was.  Right in front of our eyes.  That was fantastic.  Time to make the jism.  Now we're starting to bomb.  That's all right.  All right, we'll go back to Kenny.  Now we know when it's time to go back.  There we go.  Time to go back to Kenny.  Kenny on stage.  You know, the other night,  my dog kept me up.  My dog was barking all night long 
[02:17:00]  until I threw his shoe at it.  It was a hush puppy.  Oh!  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't always have a cool job like this.  One time I worked at a hospital,  but I got fired for throwing the colostomy bags around  like water balloons.  They didn't seem to mind when I was fucking the old people  and the dead people,  but the colostomy bags put them over the edge.  And ladies, you know what the hardest thing  about wearing a colostomy bag is?  Back me up.  Finds his shoes to match. 
[02:17:30]  But even though I got fired from the hospital,  I still became a gynecologist,  but I got fired from that job too  because I got caught eating on the job.  How many times did he say job?  Yeah, nobody can call me a quitter  because I got fired from every job I ever had.  And you know, I usually don't tell this.  Come on.  That was like the clever.  That was pretty.  Kenny stuck in a clever one.  Clever one.  He totally threw the crowd off. 
[02:18:00]  I know.  They were bracing themselves.  They were like,  well, it's got to be something really heinous.  No?  Oh.  Hey, Pat from Menaki wants in.  Pat.  Hey.  Have monkey eat your ass.  He'll eat anything.  Adam in Texas.  Adam.  Hey, I've been fucked a whole lately.  All right.  Back to Kenny's stand-up here. 
[02:18:30]  Be a quitter because I got fired from every job I ever had.  And you know, I usually don't tell this,  but since it's the holidays and you're a nice crowd,  one time I was a production assistant on a set of porno movies  and my job was to hold up the guy's ball sack up and out of the way  so the camera could get a nice close-up shot of the dick fucking the pussy.  Way to word it.  But I got fired from that job also 
[02:19:00]  because I kept dropping the balls out of my mouth.  Can you pause?  I want to congratulate you on the most horribly worded joke ever.  It actually is not a bad joke,  but he actually just tells it without joke form.  He just talks it through.  So I would go to the job and I would hold the balls up,  but that wasn't part of it.  Jesus, Kenny.  My job as a production assistant...  And he said up twice is to hold them up out of the way up in front of the camera.  Up in front of the camera.  He just sort of over-explained it. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Hold the balls up so they could see the dick.  It was like you were applying for the job again.  What I did was I held the balls up,  so I'm good at that then.  He was testifying.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  Two Jews are meandering into a speakeasy  that actually lost its liquor license but then got it back recently  and through a string of legal actions,  they wound up owning it,  but then they were going to sell it.  So they're meandering. 
[02:20:00]  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Early to bed, early to ride.  Makes me want to come in your eyes.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Vegas.  Clint.  It's rape and date, and I helped.  Shake and bake.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Got it.  Joe in the big city.  Joe.  Pardon me.  Would you have any Jimmy to poop on?  That's actually not bad.  That's not really as bad as it came off.  His delivery stunk. 
[02:20:30]  Let's go back to the stage.  I can take out my bacon, stick it in your can.  We're going back to Kenny on stage.  So the other night, I'm home watching TV,  and I'm watching this movie that's got a brutal rape scene.  And you know what I don't understand?  Why is it every time after a chick gets raped,  they always take a hot shower?  What are they trying to do? 
[02:21:00]  Wash away the memories?  And is it still considered a date rape if you don't take them to a movie afterwards?  And speaking of rape, you know what my fantasy is?  To rape a bride.  Right in a white dress and everything.  I grab her around the throat with a knife.  I drag her into a bathroom.  I bend her over the sink.  And like ten minutes after she said I do,  she did.  Can I say I am actually offended? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Kenny says, love to fuck that pussy.  Wow.  I'm very proud of my closing joke, though.  Yeah, the closing joke will do it?  Yeah, we're getting towards the end.  Yeah, I know.  That was fun, though.  Let's go back to Kenny.  Fun while it lasted. 
[02:22:00]  Well, since you like rape jokes so much,  how about a few pedophile jokes?  You know, when my son was a toddler,  my wife asked me to give him a bath.  So I decided to bathe with him.  So while we were bathing, my son asked me,  he goes, Daddy,  how come your penis is different than mine?  And I said, son,  because you don't have a boner.  Listen.  Listen.  Holy.  What is wrong with him?  To the silence. 
[02:22:30]  Listen to the silence.  The sounds of silence.  I do like that old commercial he used to do, though.  Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.  And boy, if that bomb was fan, he's going to get called out.  But since it didn't, I wrote it.  Listen to the silence again.  And I said, son, because you don't have a boner.  Because you know how you can make your dick look really big?  You put it in a five-year-old's hand. 
[02:23:00]  And of course, everybody knows what you do when you're done fucking a bald pussy.  You put the diaper back on.  You don't have to say, yeah, and clapped.  One friend.  Now that I accomplished what I had to do with all the groans, I'll leave you with this.  All right?  You seem like a smart crowd.  Is it the slick back?  What's the difference between a clever midget and a girl with a venereal disease? 
[02:23:30]  One's a cunning runt.  Thank you.  You've been a good crowd.  Enjoy the holidays.  Good night.  Do you know...  Club Soda Kitty, everybody.  Show him some love.  Show him some love.  Show him some love.  Show him some love.  Show him some love.  Show him a rake over his head.  Why show him love?  He wouldn't recognize it if it appeared.  Jesus.  A little harsh there, Kenny. 
[02:24:00]  Did you like my closing joke?  Yeah, I heard it on...  You know, when I was a kid, Shelley Sunstein used to tell this joke on WPLJ in the morning.  And me and my friend would tell each other the joke.  And that was one of the jokes that I heard when I was like 15 in high school on WPLJ.  A cunning runt.  Really?  Yes.  So it brought back some fun memories for you, Jimmy.  Yes.  What you're saying.  Exactly.  Yeah, but it's kind of so a running cunt.  Oh, is that it?  Oh.  I didn't know there was a reverse there.  Okay, that makes sense.  Let's go to Dan. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, what's the difference between a clever midget and a girl with a venereal disease?  Wait.  What?  Oh, now I get it.  We get it.  We get it.  A clever midget is a smart little fella?  One's a cunning runt.  The other one has a running cunt.  No, the other one is, not has.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Dan in Vermont.  Yeah, I'll bring the jack.  I'll bring the jack to see if I can look on that radio.  Uh, is he doing a bit? 
[02:25:00]  Dan.  Uh, Dan.  He must have had a hold for a while.  Yeah.  No, he's like trying to smash a radio live on the show or something, and it's failing miserably.  Dan.  Dan.  Do you have a good Christmas, dude?  Who is he talking to?  Dan, who are you talking to?  Oh, please kill yourself on the air.  I was going to say, you're going to hear a gunshot. 
[02:25:30]  That would rock.  Dan.  Boom.  This is not Dan-tastic.  We won't be ignored, Dan.  Camero, this is a computer dude.  It's actually pretty cool, man.  You can like take a picture, dude.  Let's fucking just print the picture out in like two seconds.  What a dope.  He has no idea he's on, or is this a bit?  No, it's not a bit.  It's too awful to be a bit, even from a bad listener.  Dan?  Last chance?  Yeah, you don't even need a computer dude. 
[02:26:00]  You just plug the cord from the camera to the printer.  Oh.  This is like behind-the-scene Photoshop.  Yeah.  All right.  Kenny, anything else you want to say?  I want to wish all the people a happy new year.  All right.  You want to say goodbye to Canada, or should we do that?  Yeah.  Who?  Just a little country.  What happened? 
[02:26:30]  They're not gone with the program?  They are.  Would you like to say goodbye to Canada, or should we do it?  Up to your act, I think we were fine.  I think we were just fine.  All right, Kenny.  Look, you can't blame me for their country.  All right.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  And I'll talk to you about our New Year's plans in Philly at the Tower Theater.  With Jim Norton.  Yes, we're all going down there.  All right, Kenny.  Make sure everybody gets the tickets.  All right.  Thanks, fellas.  Have a nice day anyway.  All right.  All right.  Bye. 
[02:27:00]  90% of that was a really good bit.  Man, he is just – that is beyond anything I –  And they were enjoying him up to that point.  They were actually enjoying him, and then he was like – they're like, ugh.  Yeah.  I think when he did his so-called rape joke, when he just described a rape –  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rather than having, like, some sort of punchline.  Any kind of punchline or humor to it or irony or anything, but just a description of a horror. 
[02:27:30]  Rape's a tough one to sell in comedy, but it can be if you do it right, if you sell it right, if the joke is good.  But, like, when you just describe it and then go, ugh, at the end.  Yeah.  Not quite it.  What a twisted –  So, your tag is – so, that's what I do.  Yeah.  Right.  That's real good.  Twisted fuck he is, man.  All right.  Well, we'll step aside, regroup.  I got a tinkle-ope.  I know.  Bill Byrne's studio.  Are we promoting anything today, Bill?  I'm going to be at Caroline's, January 5th through the 8th. 
[02:28:00]  Look at that.  Where are you New Year's Eve, sweetie?  Oh, Jesus, Jim.  I'm in Livonia, Michigan.  Holy shit.  Livonia, Michigan.  That sounds like a black girl's name.  At a little club called Kickers.  Kickers in Livonia, Michigan.  That has a dance club next to it.  It's one of those deals.  You ever get, like, called in, like, August for a gig, like, four months down the road?  Yeah, it's good money.  Fuck it.  I'll do it.  And then all of a sudden, December comes along.  Like, am I in –  What am I doing?  Kickers.  Am I in greater Detroit?  Bill, is it a million a night?  No. 
[02:28:30]  Kickers.  Kickers.  It might be a great gig, though.  And what night is that?  He's such an asshole.  What night is that?  What is – oh, 29th, 30th, 31st.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve is what I was going for.  You're going to be in Livonia?  Kickers.  Livonia, Michigan.  New Year's Eve?  Really?  Yeah.  See, a lot of guys go for, like, you know, theaters, or they go for an A-room, but not  me.  I keep it real.  I keep it gully. 
[02:29:00]  I'm just – what's sadder is that there are people that actually live there that have  to spend New Year's Eve there?  Yeah, you can leave.  You're at least making money.  Yes.  Oh, this is pathetic.  You guys are, like, some of the meanest people on the planet, and, like, this gig is so bad,  you're actually trying to find something positive about it.  I'm trying –  But no, no, I've done enough gigs where I know it's a gig.  It's money, man.  It's like – I'll work any club, like, if the money is right, who cares?  Buy yourself a new wristwatch.  Yeah, buy yourself a new wristwatch, something like that.  My wife loves that car. 
[02:29:30]  But just somebody has to say to his wife, look, honey, we can't spend that money, or  I'm not going to be able to get tickets for kickers.  Right.  They're the problem.  You're doing the right thing doing the gig.  What are you doing on New Year's Eve?  Kickers.  Oh, you're doing the kickers?  Because we're going to kickers, too.  That's like all the talk of Livonia.  Kickers is the place.  It is.  In Livonia.  Wow.  All right.  I guess it's the guy who owns it used to be a kicker in the NFL.  So what he did –  He was an abusive spouse. 
[02:30:00]  What happened to black in her eye?  Head closed.  Wow.  Lives in Livonia.  Let's see what Livonia's all about.  All right.  It's a national talk show.  We've got people listening all over the joint.  Eric in Livonia, Michigan.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you very much, Sean.  Will you be going to see Bill Burr at kickers in Livonia?  Hell no.  I wouldn't be caught dead there, either. 
[02:30:30]  What is Livonia like?  It's just a suburb of Detroit.  I mean, it's your typical suburb.  Yeah, but Detroit isn't really your typical city.  Is it a – is it safe?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's only maybe five or six murders every week.  Can you still see Snake Plissken walking down the –  All right, Eric.  Thank you for helping us out with Livonia.  The guy has not enlightened us at all.  With that, we should cut our losses, go to break. 
[02:31:00]  We'll continue with Bill Burr and Jim Norton and the rest, okay?  Right.  We've got Howard Stern talking about the number one satellite radio provider here,  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Everybody.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no.  I'm choosing not to join in.  Oh, come on, guys.  I was whistling.  Oh, golly gee.  Bill Burr in studio.  He's playing Livonia. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Michigan starting tomorrow, I guess.  Why tomorrow?  Well, this guy Patrick in Detroit, he's a little –  He's a little pissed off, I think.  Patrick, what do you got?  Hey, Bill Burr better need to get a hold of his agent or something because Kickers is  taking reservations for an 8 o'clock show for him tonight.  They got him on their website starting there tonight and playing through New Year's Eve.  Well, he was originally scheduled, but then he's like, fuck that, I'm not going out. 
[02:32:00]  It was a contract dispute.  Right.  I'm kidding, of course.  Enjoy staring at the wall.  That's a great fucking joke.  No, that's for real, man.  It's good.  I'm on the website right now.  Get the fuck out of here.  Hawk, why don't you jump on that website?  You're off the wrestling site.  Kickerscomplex.com.  Hold on, let me look.  Fucking Eric's doing this.  Get it right there.  Get it up.  All right, is it advertising?  No, I'm not.  I better not be.  It's for 28 through the 31st.  I called him yesterday and booked a fucking table for you.  Tonight at 8 o'clock, you better get on a plane soon.  Or else what?  I have to wait until Friday. 
[02:32:30]  Wait a minute.  You're starting to think you might have to be there?  It's not like I haven't done this before.  Oh, no.  It would be hilarious if I'm supposed to be in like a fucking airport terminal right now.  We're trying to find out for you.  Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m.  It does say.  Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m.  Showtime.  You got an 8 o'clock show tonight.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, my God.  20 acres in Livonia, Michigan.  Can you please call us tomorrow morning from Livonia, Michigan? 
[02:33:00]  Tomorrow morning.  I got to make a call right now.  He's got to go right now.  What if I have a flight?  Maybe I have a flight.  Do I have a flight in the afternoon?  Probably.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Whatever.  Hey, listen, guys.  I had a great time.  Thanks for...  What are you saying?  The flights to Livonia?  Believe me, Bill, there's plenty available.  No one's going to say the flights to Livonia are sold out.  We can get one of our trucker friends to just pick you up and get you up there.  I'll drop y'all.  I'll drop y'all.  Oh, you're pitching O&A bits the whole way out there.  I got a friend of mine. 
[02:33:30]  You was goddamn funny that time you was doing that thing on the show.  What was that thing?  The whole drive to Livonia.  Hey, Patrick.  So, you like Gangster Fag?  Patrick, I think you're on to something because Bill's panicking a little bit.  Yeah, well...  He's going to go make a phone call.  I know.  They got a two-for-one ticket, too.  So, it's eight bucks to see him tonight.  Two-for-one.  You got a two-for-one ticket?  Yeah.  You got ten hours to get there.  You're fine, Bill.  Me and my friend are paying four bucks each to come see you tonight. 
[02:34:00]  You better get there, man.  Two-for-one ticket.  And you better be good.  I want my four-thousand.  No, no, no, no.  That you can print out and clip.  That's trick advertising.  Do you see it?  It's right there on the page.  Wednesday or Thursday, 8 p.m., two-for-one.  Yeah, it's two-for-one Wednesday because I'm not going to be there.  Bill's 28 through 31.  It does say 28 through 31 on the calendar.  Show him the calendar so he doesn't think...  That would be four days.  28 through 31.  Today's the...  My entire infrastructure is on vacation.  Oh, my God.  All right, Patrick.  Hey, and Bill, don't worry. 
[02:34:30]  Livonia is extremely Caucasian like you.  You'll be safe.  What airline do you fly?  You guys are the scary ones.  What airline?  Huh?  Why don't you check?  Make sure you don't have a flight.  Dude, I don't know any...  The mere fact that I'm here and I should be on a plane, we should let you know I don't  know what I'm flying.  Hey, we got a trucker, Lance.  Lance will get you there.  Lance?  Yeah, this is...  I'm going to Livonia there.  I'll give him a ride.  He might have to grease up a little bit, but I can get him in there.  He's in big trouble, Lance. 
[02:35:00]  We don't use a heavy board like you, Lance.  Alabama trucker, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Bill Byer.  Bill Byer is coming to fucking Alabama, and I scheduled this all to be home, and I can't  wait to see him at the Stardome.  It's going to be fucking awesome.  Well, when is Bill coming to Alabama?  You might want to let Bill know, because I'm sure he doesn't have a flight book.  Not a clue.  It's this every later than that, and Jimmy Norton, you need to bring your little faggot 
[02:35:30]  ass down there, because I want to see you, too.  Well, you know, sir, hurtful talk like that isn't going to get me booked.  It's the exact thing that's going to keep me...  It's just giving you some hot tub talk.  Hot tub talk.  I'll give you a little hug.  All right.  And now someone's saying there's a snowstorm coming, so you better hurry and get the hell  out of New York.  All right.  No, that's great.  That'll be my excuse.  Woody in Detroit.  Hey.  There's a big snowstorm on its way into Detroit right now.  Oh, shit.  That means I can't go?  No, I'm sure if you show up by, you know, 5 o'clock, you get out there, no problem. 
[02:36:00]  The airport's right by Livonia, anyway.  So then there's really no urgency here.  I'm impressed by all the Michigan listeners, actually.  All right.  Let's go to Greg in Tennessee.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I got my XM radio about a month ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And, man, I haven't changed this station since I installed this thing.  And I thank you guys kick ass.  All right on, man.  Thank you.  I listen to you every day, listen to the replays every night. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah?  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  And just for saying, for everybody who got their XM radio for Christmas, just so they  could wait on little Howard Stern, they can take their radio and shove it up their ass  sideways.  Yeah, I suppose you enjoy the show, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you have a lot of laughs.  Do ya?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks, Greg.  I was expecting a really bad.  That was really surprising.  Sometimes you can tell about the time.  I've, uh, whatever a call starts out like that, it's never a good call.  I've had my, uh, oh, shit.  All right.  But, uh, he was a good thing. 
[02:37:00]  Gotta say hi to everyone that got the XM for Christmas.  They're checking us out for the first time.  Hi.  Hey, uh, pop culture, and, uh, you gonna go make a phone call?  I gotta find out.  Bill Burr is gonna find out if he has to get on a plane.  Can I tell you my picture on the air?  Yeah, we should do it on the air, actually.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Why not?  Get the phone number.  We'll do it on the air.  Okay, uh, everyone's, excuse me, everyone's doing their year in review crap.  Yep.  Pop culture, uh, 2005 in review.  All right.  Why don't we take a listen to this, and stop when we have to. 
[02:37:30]  In 2005, the iPod Nano and the Xbox 360 were the hot sellers.  What about satellite radio?  That was one of the hot sellers.  Well, she doesn't know.  She's dumb.  In my stupid little circle, man, I can't tell you how many satellite radios were bought.  It was unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Maybe she's involved with a company that has an interest in satellite radio not succeeding.  Britney Spears had a baby.  Remember when she was merely a cheerleader that you would sleep with? 
[02:38:00]  Michael Jackson arrived to court fashionably late.  Showing up in his pajama pants.  I mean, Michael Jackson.  Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith, was the top grossing film of the year.  And everybody was talking about Brokeback Mountain.  It's spelled love that kid.  It's a year in review, and they're saying everybody was talking about this movie for maybe the last couple days.  Yeah.  And no one has thought of Revenge of the Sith in eight months.  No.  I can't even say that word. 
[02:38:30]  Sith.  Revenge of the Jewish boy.  Oh, that's Seth.  Revenge of the Sith.  There's such a revenge.  That's why these year in review things are ridiculous.  Right.  By the way, Newsflash.  Yes.  If Steve Martin dies the day the Pink Panther comes out, I'm going to laugh.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Oh.  So will I, Jimmy.  So will I.  That fucking disgrace.  Some movies should not be remade.  Why would you do that to you?  Especially comedies, because there's some movies that are worth remaking because the technology 
[02:39:00]  got better, blah, blah, blah.  But comedies, never.  That in-laws movie was on again.  What the fuck were they thinking with Michael Douglas' remake?  And he did it with Beyonce.  Stop with the black chicks to try to get your audience and their audience.  Yeah, it's a crossover, man.  Oh, he's going to work.  The longest yard.  Why?  Why?  I don't get it.  Just weren't the original.  I don't get it.  I saw before the movie started yesterday at the theater, the movie theater, they had  a little thing on keeping your cell phone off, and it was Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, okay.  It was so bad, I couldn't even watch it.  Well, the cell phone was ringing.  It was pretty funny, though, because the cell phone's, like, ringing in his pocket a lot.  Yeah, and he was doing Inspector Clouseau, which him doing Inspector Clouseau is his wild  and crazy guy voice from SNL.  Oh, I didn't hear him talk.  Oh, yeah, he talked. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  And it was the exact voice of two wild and crazy guys.  What a fucking ass-hearted.  Peter Sellers, when he is doing the parallel bars, and he's on the fucking parallel bars,  and he jumps off, and he falls on a flight of steps.  The dismount.  You're not going to do anything that funny.  Yeah.  That was what he did.  And those movies hold off, too.  Just rent the originals.  Yeah.  You're so right, Jimmy.  I'm so glad the Honeymooners bombed as bad as it did, because we don't have to sit through 
[02:40:30]  any more.  Because if that movie did well, they would have thrown a bunch of those at us.  People are laughing because they're able to watch Bill Burr through the glass, talking  on his phone, on camera.  The pal talk is going to take over the world.  Yeah, pal talk.  People get an insight to the show that's a little different than just listening to it,  because they're commenting.  They go, holy shit, Bill Burr is on the phone outside the glass talking.  Yeah, this is real.  I'm totally fucked right now, because stupid Jason Steinberg is in... 
[02:41:00]  I'm calling him stupid.  I don't know where my fucking gig is.  He's out of the country.  Out of the country?  And the booker's not answering.  So what do I do now?  I call the club?  I would call the club.  Yeah, call the club.  Call the club, then call the airline.  Might you fly?  We're looking at a calendar right now, and it definitely says that it's you.  Oh, God.  It has Bill Burr blocked off from 28th through the 31st.  Yeah, but it's only like an hour and a half flight, so I would think that he would book  me on an afternoon flight, right?  So you think you might just have a flight waiting for him?  Well, how would you know about your flight info? 
[02:41:30]  Normally an email or something?  How normally would you find out?  Turn and a half in Livonia?  Because even if it's tomorrow, how do you know it?  Where are you flying, to Detroit, and then you drive to Livonia?  Yeah.  They actually just open the door.  It's a suburb.  It's like, uh...  Yeah, give me some O.P. and Anthony bumper stickers.  Yeah.  Toss them out.  Well, Bill, if you've got to go tomorrow, how would you normally find out your flight?  Like, they're not there anymore, so would you normally just check your phone?  I'm not an organized person.  I think it's somewhere within...  I don't know about that.  I think we're somewhere within...  Dude, I'm a comedian.  I'm never... 
[02:42:00]  I'm learning about Bill.  I've actually known him for many years.  I would have thought that this was...  Ben loves when things go wrong, too.  He just...  That's right.  For anybody but him.  This is so not helpful.  Ben is just not helpful.  Yeah.  Like, fuck, where am I going?  I'm really surprised no one has...  Is that Joe, not Joey?  No one has turned around and just punched Ben in the face.  Because he'll laugh openly at your demise, kicker.  He really does.  Not that demise was the right word there, but I think you got the point.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  It's not a demise, really.  It's just a...  I would check airlines.  Call a couple of...  Oh, wait, wait.  Ellen DeGeneres is dancing on TV.  I feel better now. 
[02:42:30]  Oh!  I feel better now.  There she goes.  Look at the guys.  They're all dancing.  They just love her.  Oh, wow.  That's got to be so much fun to be there while she dances.  You know what I want to see dancing?  Wait, this might be the one where my sister's dancing.  I'll tell you in a second.  She went to one of these TV.  Groucho Marx.  I'm embarrassed that she was dancing.  Why don't you have one of your listeners somehow get into the studio audience?  Wouldn't it be great?  I want to see an Arab with a winter coat indoors dancing and putting his hands in his pockets  so he knows something awful.  And then when she dances in front of him, he doesn't blow himself up.  He just jerks off on her. 
[02:43:00]  All right, let's get back to the pop culture of 2005.  You know when she dies, they can be like, she always loved to dance.  She's such a good dancer.  She hates it, though.  She'd try to stop it, and they would not let her stop it.  She's Ellen.  She can do what she wants.  She could stop it if she wants.  Why did you change the channel, Iraq?  You didn't think they were done.  This is your favorite.  I bet you dance alone in the fucking apartment when you're watching this.  Everyone is dancing with her.  Oh, the cameraman.  The camera guy.  You know they hate it.  You know they hate it.  Oh.  Wow.  All right, back to the audio. 
[02:43:30]  You ever dance like that when you pretend you're on a fucking balcony shooting innocent  Holocaust victims?  That fucking hairdo?  Oh, the new.  Should we be back in his hair, you think?  Yeah, he's doing the old ring around the tub, I'll kill you for it dance.  I notice he's greasing it down, trying to like just.  A little bit.  Just.  It would be great if she rolled off the back of the chair right through that window.  Yes, Ben.  Ben, we called the club, and they don't know if Phil's playing there tonight, either.  How did they not know?  Kickers?  Yes.  They don't know?  Good.  They don't know?  I don't know.  It's not my fucking fault. 
[02:44:00]  I'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  I'm relaxed now.  Yeah, he's sitting back.  All right, let's get back to this audio.  Pop Culture 2005.  The year in review.  We're in the middle of this.  It's dope.  Love that can't be fulfilled.  Cowboys who secretly want to get in each other's pants.  The must-have pet this year?  A puggle.  That's what you get when you mix a pug and a beagle.  If there can be a puggle, then why can't there be a Brangelina?  In Hollywood, Brangelina was born after Brad dumped Jen.  When the year started, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were still married. 
[02:44:30]  We felt that they would last for a while.  Oh, and then here comes Angelina Jolie.  I hope 2006 is the year to get rid of that style of doing TV shows.  That fucking three-second in-and-out clip show shit is atrocious.  I've done a couple, too.  It was a great idea.  Even we did one.  That's how...  What rung in show business are you?  Like, what are you between?  You know, a mime and a comedian? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Big Apple Circus Clown and...  And John Wayne Gacy's version of it.  Fucking...  We were in the cell last night.  And I saw Patrice on one of those shows.  I mean, we've all done them, though, so I can't shit on him because I've done them, too.  They're atrocious.  Because they never use the funny shit you say.  They never use the brutal stuff.  It's always the cutesy.  Do the impression of it.  That Richard Pryor, I ain't dead yet, motherfucker, special they did on Comedy Central, I wanted to throw up.  Yeah.  I wanted to throw up. 
[02:45:30]  They just did the same thing.  Grabbed the cutesy clips.  Everybody doing Mud Bones.  Fucking...  Oh, just awful.  I haven't seen that yet.  Believe me.  Thank God.  Clip shows.  Yeah, it's done.  Brutal hacks.  We shouldn't even be talking about Jeff Foxworthy if he died.  Fucking just terrible.  You know, I remember watching Richard Pryor back when, shut up.  Well, they had Collins on.  You're not even worthy.  They had, you know, Juan and I guess Mooney.  I mean, I think that's a good act, but it was just awful.  You know, the Comedy Central edited it. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  All right, let's get back to that.  Did Mooney blame the white man for his death in any way, shape, or form?  I don't know what that motherfucker did.  I don't know what that motherfucker did.  I don't know what that motherfucker did.  I don't know what that motherfucker did.  Pop culture review.  Let's get back to this.  You needed a little drink.  And that...  Timmy does impressions, man.  That's a great one.  That's a dead-on Paul Mooney.  I saw that thing.  I knew the motherfucker didn't do it.  A little Chardonnay.  Oh, you know what?  We're not going to go back to that.  No. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you, Than.  What did you bring, Than?  That brings a lot of good stuff to the table.  This might be fantastic.  We'll have to...  It's got to be fantastic.  We'll have to listen.  Boy?  A little water?  Boy?  Boy?  It's the Pink Panther trailer on here.  Oh, wow.  The crime of the century has been committed.  Yeah.  This film, fucko.  And only one man can solve it.  Officer Jacques Clouseau, gendarme, third class.  Ah!  Oof.  That had to help. 
[02:47:00]  He's got a partner.  Without warning, I will attack you.  In this way, have a good vigilant and a laugh.  Good one.  Thank you.  He's got a clue.  He was just found dead.  Was it fatal?  Yes.  How fatal?  Completely.  Ah!  Steve Martin.  Kevin Kline.  I see you have one of these collapsible pointers. 
[02:47:30]  You just snap!  And Beyonce knows.  Ah!  Here she is.  Miss Peppers!  Oh!  Oh!  The Pink Panther.  The Pink Panther.  You know what, Steve?  You stink!  You should be fucking ashamed of yourself. 
[02:48:00]  Hallelujah.  What's the matter? They couldn't get a fatter, saucy black girl?  Enough already. The Queen Latifah, we get it.  You're the goofy white guy.  The older gentleman. He makes me sick. He used to be so funny, too.  Yeah.  The stand-up was actually innovative. You know, arrow through the head.  He said, not this one.  But it was innovative, because he was the first to do that.  I agree. He was funny at times.  And then it became hacky after that.  Cat, handcuffs, king tut. 
[02:48:30]  No, are you kidding me?  Today, if you went on stage with an arrow through the head and a banjo,  you'd be immediately a comic genius.  Oh, my God. They would kill you.  They would fucking kill you.  He was winning Oscars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Little short films.  He did some funny movies.  I mean, really funny.  He did some of the fucking The Jerk, Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Roxanne.  He was great.  Planes, Trains, Automobiles.  How great was he on SNL?  He was always hilarious.  But then...  This was a fucking disgrace.  He crossed over.  Yeah.  All right.  And even that other one. 
[02:49:00]  What's that movie?  Bringing Down the House.  Fucking Cheaper by the Dozen.  Cheaper by the Dozen 2.  How much for your dignity, Steve?  I have that on DVD.  I own that.  Oh, wow.  Cheaper by the Dozen.  I'll be over watching that.  Just once a year, I have to take it off the shelf.  Yeah.  Go watch it tonight when you're not at Kicks or Kickers.  Kickers.  How about Cheaper by the Fives, starring Andrea Yates?  I don't know.  That's a movie you've got to see.  I am the Pink Pouncer.  Are you? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, really?  Are you, Steve?  Why don't you just fucking...  Why don't you remake Being There, too?  Why don't you steal that?  Why don't you steal that?  You are suspected of drowning your babies?  Did you drown your babies?  I say five pillows without head imprints in them.  I will need the testimony of the weeping grandmother.  Mrs. Smith, your van was found in reverse. 
[02:50:00]  Your children were strapped in the baby seats as it rolled backwards into the lek.  Into the lek?  That's what I said, the lek.  Because you're trying to be Russian all of a sudden.  Mr. Stanberg, a little Lisa was a...  All right.  I'm looking for a little Connell Peterson.  He had a little baseball hat and his head was detached from his body. 
[02:50:30]  Is it true you took a boat out and dumped your pregnant wife into the water?  The cowboy hat was found with the note.  Why does he sound German?  It's that fucking hairdo, Eric.  It's rubbing off on my impressions.  We found her little six-shoot hairs next to her little strangled body. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, he should fucking be decapitated.  He should be decapitated.  Speaking of decapitation...  At the wall.  I didn't want to see the name.  Of course you did.  What do you think, he's listening?  I wonder how Blake Edwards feels about this fucking thievery.  Is he dead?  Oh.  Is he?  Then I don't know.  He's got to be.  Is he?  I guess he doesn't care.  We haven't heard his name associated with this thing. 
[02:51:30]  All of a sudden, I'm obsessed with Blake Edwards.  I don't even know if he's alive anymore.  All right.  Let's get back to the audio.  Pop culture.  It kind of killed the whole momentum of that.  It really did.  Who is it?  Thank God.  That's why we move on.  We've got all sorts of things to move on to.  Doesn't he have a show on XM?  Blake Edwards?  No.  Pop culture.  In review.  He's a kicker.  And that's just what she did.  Jessica Simpson walked out on Nick Lachey.  I was really shocked that Nick and Jessica broke up because they seemed to have the right  relationship.  Really?  Jessica was the flower.  Nick was the gardener. 
[02:52:00]  But the news of celebrity romances wasn't all bad in 2005.  Does every clip show have to have the fucking faggot insider?  Yeah.  Every clip show.  Knows everything.  Has the faggoty designer or hairdresser.  And Michael Ian Black.  He's in every one.  Every single one.  And has yet to say anything remotely funny.  He just says sentences and then just kind of.  And they put him on every single one of these shows.  And all of a sudden she left him. 
[02:52:30]  And there was a good year for that type of genre.  Celebrity romances wasn't all bad.  In 2005.  Demi and Ashton tied the knot.  I still don't believe to be an Ashton Kutcher.  After all these years of dating, no one ever thought it would work out.  Demi and Ashton is so clearly a photo op.  Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are having a baby. 
[02:53:00]  While Tom was hanging all over his Katie, he was jumping all over our mat.  Oh, Matt, Matt.  You don't even.  You're glib.  Oh, you should have blasted him right in the face.  Hanging and jumping kind of like.  Because they're both physical things you do.  Right.  Yeah.  So.  That was wonderful.  Oh, the phone's ringing while I'm on the radio.  Oh, boy.  Hello?  Hi, Esty.  Can I call you back?  I'm on the radio.  Yeah.  Esty!  I hope he says hello, Esty. 
[02:53:30]  Okay.  Bill Burr says he doesn't need the club anymore.  I'll call you back.  I'm only here for like one or two days.  This is totally.  No, it's all about Jimmy.  It's Esty from the Comedy Cellar.  I wish somebody at Kickers would call me.  Yeah.  Where the hell is the manager at Kickers?  Esty's.  I love her.  I told her I'm on the air.  She's like, I just have to know if you're here next week.  That's Esty.  She always hooks me up when I go down there.  Comedy Cellar is a great, great comedy club here in Manhattan.  If you're visiting New York, check it out.  Because it's the home club for all these guys when they're trying out their stuff before they hit the road. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  And anytime Seinfeld or Chris Rock goes on, you never know who's going to walk on stage and do a few minutes.  It's great.  Anyway.  A lot of controversy on the instant feedback and the pal talk.  Yeah.  Apparently Tony P from Ohio.  Jesus Christ, give a motherfucker five minutes to figure out pal talk before banning him from the room.  I'm hearing a few people getting a little power crazy now in pal talk.  And they're kicking and banning some people from the room. 
[02:54:30]  I don't know what Tony P did.  I think the only thing you should be banned for is pulling out your cock.  Pulling out your cock.  Well, let's not jump to conclusions, Ope.  There might be a reason for it.  I don't know this Tony P.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him you don't want to see his cock.  He won't show it.  Believe me.  Hey, you know who they should ban from making movies?  Steve M.  Right.  Steve M.  Has a problem.  You know what would be great for me to do?  Tony P.  I'm banning him from instant feedback for complaining about pal talk.  That's right.  And we're sending someone over to your house to take your ex-am away from you. 
[02:55:00]  That's right.  Right in front of your eyes.  Flush it down the toilet.  I'm going to fuck your girlfriend and ban you from her vagina.  I don't know why he was banned.  All right.  We got a little more pop culture, the year in review.  Hollywood's young actresses seem to all be shrinking.  There was Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff.  And we just...  What did she say?  Yeah.  What did she add to that?  She listed people.  Nothing.  Typical dumb broad.  Nothing funny.  She listed people.  And there was this one, that one, this one, that one. 
[02:55:30]  How come I can't get on stage?  How come we say men are funnier than we are?  And we just couldn't take our eyes off Bobby and Whitney.  Nothing can stop Bobby and Whitney.  And their show was alternately beautiful and then amazingly embarrassing.  Oh, my stomach.  Ew!  When you mix...  Can I point something out?  Yeah.  Fuckhead trying to sound smart.  You say alternately beautiful and amazing. 
[02:56:00]  You don't have to say alternately this.  You understand?  He said alternately and then didn't give two alternate things.  An alternate.  Right.  The man's a boob.  Alternately a faggot.  When you mix...  Good example.  Crazy people, crack, and fun, you're going to be together forever.  That's not neat.  You can sum up this year's music in three simple words.  Mariah, Madonna, and Kanye.  Mariah, Madonna.  Although many tried to write Mariah Carey off...  I did not think that Mariah could come back. 
[02:56:30]  I thought she was too crazy.  She made a big comeback this year.  I mean, you don't get my...  Touching feet.  What the fuck?  What?  This is just nonsense.  This is nothing.  This is nothing.  He didn't think she could come back because she's too...  She's too nutty?  I did not think.  He starts everything real slow.  Like something amazing is going to come out and then nothing happens.  It's just dreck.  Nothing.  I had no idea...  Crazy sells records. 
[02:57:00]  Tommy Lee got another tattoo.  Yeah, right.  Who wants to shoot themselves editing this?  Like, who is the poor motherfucker that has to sit there making shit and edit this crap together?  Anything mean you say, they take out.  Anything mean you...  These can be fun to do if you could destroy the celebrities.  I've done a few of these.  You just smash them.  You know, whatever tragedy they had, whatever drunk driving ticket they got, you fucking make fun of, right out.  They'll put the fucking gay designer going, and the hair was messy. 
[02:57:30]  That's what we should do.  We should take one of these exact shows, cut out all the comedians they use, and re-edit it with our guys.  I love it.  How funny would that be?  That's kind of like the bit that I was thinking of with fucking our New Year's resolutions.  No, it wasn't.  It was nothing like it.  I like to fucking...  Your idea is stupid.  Well, now that Bill Burr's here, I'm ready to give my New Year's resolution.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What is that?  I don't know.  He probably doesn't really have one.  Let's move on.  Back to the clips. 
[02:58:00]  No, no.  I want to hear it.  I don't want to lose clip momentum.  I don't want to be kept in the dark.  It's going to affect my comedy for the rest of the show.  Let's go back to the clips.  I feel left out.  No, I'm sure it's nothing important.  I mean, whatever it was, we can get right back to the clips.  You sure even cracked me up the last two days.  Damn, storm coming to Detroit.  Fuck, man.  It's bad.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  From now on, this is how I look in the studio.  That line from yesterday still kills me.  What are you doing? 
[02:58:30]  I don't know.  I'm getting well.  But there's no light on him?  It's only the moonlight through the window as he's there?  Creepy?  I don't know.  Can you help me?  They have me painted as a lunatic.  They really do.  We discovered that Anthony may have some things from World War II.  I have, right now, two collectibles from that era.  So, Jimmy had a scenario yesterday that just...  He's the most unstable man on his block.  You know he is.  That's what we were saying yesterday.  I am not. 
[02:59:00]  I am completely stable.  How many times a day do you peek out from behind your curtains?  Some sort of weapon.  Scrapped to your ankle.  Never with a weapon, but once in the morning when I'm taking a leak, the blinds are right  next to the toilet, so I kind of open them with two fingers and look out just to see  what kind of a day it is and see if anybody's lurking.  He lives like Malcolm X, just fucking holding a weckin'.  A weckin'.  A weckin'.  Holding a weckin'.  No, exactly.  I hold a wickin'.  And she conjures up things for me.  A weckin'.  I don't know.  I said Malcolm Weckin'.  I said Silly. 
[02:59:30]  Weckin' the whole bit, you wascally wabbit.  I got scared.  I just wanted to share that thing that you did yesterday with Bill, but whatever.  I have a couple of...  It just makes me laugh.  Dude, I'm half listening.  I'm freaking out that I'm supposed to be a pneumonia right now.  All right, why don't we just go back to the tape, then?  Is that a yarmulke?  Yes.  Yes, some Jew brought it in for us.  Really?  And it's filled with change.  Way to paint with a broad brush, Ant.  It's filled with pennies, actually.  Jesus, hope.  That's not very nice.  No, it's really filled with pennies.  Is it? 
[03:00:00]  Somebody needs to go to the Museum of Tolerance.  That's right.  How irritating is that?  You can shit on any other race, and you just get shit for it.  They don't have to send you to a fucking museum.  I think that's a little pompous.  The Museum of Tolerance.  The Museum of Tolerance.  I like it.  You need to learn how to tolerate me.  How about you take a little trip to the Holocaust Museum?  Yeah.  You see what the people went through.  How about you go to the museum?  And then you make a joke.  But what do they have in Rwanda?  They got a little View Master.  That Holocaust. 
[03:00:30]  There you go.  It's less of a budget.  Yeah.  We really don't have much of a budget.  Just look.  It's machetes.  A lot of blood.  There you go.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  This clip show.  Pop culture stinks.  It's good.  I'm learning.  Raya could come back.  I thought she was too crazy.  She made a big comeback this year.  I mean, you don't get much bigger than that.  Eight Grammy nominations.  All right.  You know what?  The bad music strung through the whole fucking thing.  This show is multi-dimensional at this point. 
[03:01:00]  We were talking about Dick Clark being half a dick face.  And now that's up on Photoshop on whackbag.com.  They have morphed half a Hulk face, the homeless guy from the homeless shopping spree, and Dick Clark's face together to make half a dick.  Half a dick face.  Half a dick face.  Go to whackbag.com and go to the Photoshop section.  Those guys are doing great stuff.  Gray that hair up, though.  Huh?  Gray that hair up, whoever did that.  Cigars and Scotch.  Of course.  Cigars and Scotch.  Oh, it was cigars and Scotch? 
[03:01:30]  He can gray that hair up in a second.  He's a pro.  He is very good.  I bow to cigars and Scotch.  He does great work.  Great work.  Nothing but compliments today, I've decided.  Hey, you are a good man today.  Look at our little photos of us stuck on the bodies of the two little girls from The Shining.  That's great.  It's us as little kids.  That's really good.  And maybe you could, could you do a thing of fucking Amon Gert and Hawk?  I would like to see that fucking hairdo.  I saw you in a Nazi uniform on Photoshop yesterday. 
[03:02:00]  I think page 14 or 15.  You're up there somewhere.  14 or 15.  Yeah.  Of Photoshop volume 58.  Whatever it is.  All right, here we go.  In that eight Grammy nominations.  I like that she's putting a few pounds on, and yet the dresses always get shorter.  In her next video, she's actually bottomless.  Madonna came out with a hit CD, a rocking body, and at 47, proved she's still got it.  And so was Kanye West. 
[03:02:30]  Kanye West was a really big story last year, and this year, he did it again.  And finally, there were those who were pop icons in 2005 for no reason at all.  Paris Hilton is like, you're famous for what exactly? 
[03:03:00]  Paris is very good at being famous.  Oh, no one's ever said that.  Wow.  For being fabulous.  We love being in other people's business.  I want to know who's sleeping with who.  I want to know who's wearing what.  I can't help it.  They're not saying anything.  No.  They're not.  How about this?  Paris is famous for being a whore, for being a hook.  Why can't you really slam her a little bit?  She's famous for what?  She's just famous for being famous.  She's famous for being fabulous.  She's famous for sucking cock and taking it in the ass on video. 
[03:03:30]  And well, I like that.  Yes.  Good girl.  Good cocksucker.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Was that VH1?  That's why she's famous.  Was that VH1?  I have no idea.  You're a fucking head of programming.  I understand.  I think pop-up video started these type of things.  And that was a fun show.  It was a good show.  It was entertaining, although I didn't like reading so much.  You know what?  It would hurt my head.  Looking at the picture, I'm reading.  I'm looking.  I'm reading.  I just like the theme.  Pop-up video.  Oh.  Pop-up video I loved.  It was good.  It was an innovative show.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You get a little fact. 
[03:04:00]  Repackage.  That's all they do now is repackage things.  They take the shows.  They cut them up.  They throw it in.  Repackage.  They pay the talent $15.  Oh, you got paid?  Did you get paid for yours?  No.  I know we did one.  No.  We never got paid for that, right?  Here's why.  Because AFTRA sucks moose dick.  Oh.  They stink, AFTRA.  They're still looking for money from me.  They're fucking awful.  They can't get cable residual.  They don't even know that I'm not even part of them anymore.  Yeah, they do.  They're caved in on them.  They're fucking awful. 
[03:04:30]  I grabbed a Sharpie with a fit.  Like, if you gave a caveman a Sharpie, that's how I was holding it, and wrote on the AFTRA bill,  not with you anymore, like a lunatic, shoved it in the envelope and sent it out.  And then I got something back saying I needed to send something to prove that I'm no longer working at an AFTRA shop type of thing.  No, you figured the fuck out yourself.  Exactly.  Why should you have to provide proof?  I'm not sending any more money to AFTRA.  You stink, AFTRA.  You do nothing for nobody. 
[03:05:00]  In general, I'm pro-union.  I understand the union thing.  But, man, I mean, we had the biggest story in radio for who knows how many years, right?  And we were fucked.  We were so fucked.  They were talking about lawsuits and arrests and everything.  Now, one fucking phone call from the, quote, union to see what they could do.  Oh, yeah, if our rights were infringed upon by the company to help you shell out all this cash month after month.  Call them.  They never called me back.  Nothing.  They're fucking terrible.  Because there was a point I was panicking pretty good. 
[03:05:30]  I'm like, wow, let's see, you know, what's going on here.  Nothing.  But they had no problem making sure they got their dues in time.  Yeah.  They do nothing.  I have After Health.  I can't wait to get it because the Louis Project is SAG.  SAG is a much better union.  Yes.  And they wanted to merge with them.  They wanted to merge.  SAG went, no.  Yes.  Why would we?  Why would we?  That's like Seinfeld.  Is that how they said it?  They did.  That was exactly.  Why would we?  Why would we?  Why would we?  That's exactly how they said it, Bill.  And that was the gesture with the left hand.  Why would we?  Disgusted. 
[03:06:00]  Why would we?  Why?  It's AFTRA.  We all know they stink.  We're not merging with you.  Why would that help us?  It wouldn't.  All right.  Well, Barbara Walters did the top ten.  This is a lot of fun this year in review stuff.  It's always fun.  It's what you got to do at the end of the year.  It is the law.  Well, it's great because it's so easy to goof on.  Barbara Walters, top ten fascinating people of 2005, everybody. 
[03:06:30]  We're not going to do all ten.  Let's see if it's politically correct.  Just a couple highlights.  We got first up, Dakota Fanning was one of the top people.  Top celebrities of 2005, according to Barbara Walters.  Dakota Fanning was in War of the Worlds.  Yes.  She's the little kid that doesn't act like a little kid and it's creepy to watch her.  Yeah, the little kid.  Yeah, exactly.  I hate kid actors.  Yes.  Aren't they the worst?  Yeah, John Travolta was fun to work with.  Yeah.  Like fucking five. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, she's great.  She sounds like she's 40.  We were on set and we had such a fabulous time together working.  Well, my character is sort of sad and I learned a lot from her.  You're five years old, you idiot.  Go piss yourself.  Here we go.  Makes you happy.  It'll be on crack in six years.  Dakota Fanning, everyone.  Doing exactly what you guys just said.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I know you guys haven't heard this.  Listen to this.  Do you choose your own roles or who does?  Well, you know, my agent reads the script and my mom and I, and I think everybody kind 
[03:07:30]  of decides what's right for the time, but it's mostly me because, you know, when you're  picking the characters, I have to, you know, really feel for the character and, you know,  be able to portray it, you know, on film.  I fucking...  There she goes.  Whatever I was going to say would not sum it up as well as that did.  Sorry, sorry.  No, no, please.  That was perfect.  I fucking hate her and that was perfect. 
[03:08:00]  How old is she?  I don't know.  She's like 10, 11, maybe?  She's a cowboy hat and a garret.  She certainly does.  Whatever they call it.  That's right.  Why don't you tap dance to My Little Pony for the last time, you silly goose?  Give me one of these.  Oh, jeez.  Why not the pants down when Bill Burr's in studio?  Actually, because I had to fart badly and I would pull him down in front of Bill.  Yeah.  Fucking to hot ass.  He wants to see it, he can see it.  How old is that?  She's going to be 12 in...  I thought there was a certain level of respect we'd have for years. 
[03:08:30]  February, she's going to be 12?  Going to be 12.  Countdown clock starts at 12, you know.  That's right.  For you, maybe.  All girls.  When it ends there.  The hotness ends in...  All right.  I like that Dakota fanning.  Shut up.  Her name just annoys me.  It's such a fucking Hollywood name.  Yeah.  Dakota.  Another one of the top people of 2005, according to Barbara Walters, Kanye West.  Of course.  And here he is, freestyle.  Why? 
[03:09:00]  We're just giving you highlights from this dumb special.  There aren't any.  Here he is, freestyle rapping for Barbara.  I say really serious stuff that touches on social issues, racial things, and I get away with  it because I hide it behind really good beats or hotlines where I'll make you laugh to keep  from crying.  And I can spit a rap for you right now that you will understand also.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead.  I'm on Barbara Walters.  You know I won't falter.  Jesus walked. 
[03:09:30]  We took him to the altar.  Much taller, not shorter.  And I can talk to any reporter.  Turn on your recorder.  You know.  I love it.  Why do you love it?  Just record it to me.  I'll buy it.  That's basically how it's going now.  See, the reason why he can talk about all that stuff, he doesn't need to hide it.  You're black.  Right.  What if he...  No one's going to give you shit for that.  Who's going to give him shit?  For that.  That was awful.  He didn't know where to go with it.  And that was such a bad freestyle rap.  Barbara should have said, you know what?  That was horrendous.  I can see why you rehearsed before you recorded. 
[03:10:00]  That was really bad.  She's not brave enough to do that.  Of course she's not.  Oh, just record it.  I'll buy it.  And then she laughs.  Because I'm threatened by you.  But I want to seem like I'm not.  Yeah.  Because in her head, if she actually said, you know what?  That kind of stinks.  That makes her racist.  Yeah.  I'll put that on my other head.  That stunk.  That just stinks.  Record it for me.  I'll buy it.  I'll buy it.  See?  Because that's how unracist I am.  Barbara Walter.  Talk to any reporter.  Ter.  A little ter.  Maybe he should have written a rap about The View. 
[03:10:30]  That would have been a little more appropriate.  Ah.  I don't mean to be blunt.  Star Jones is a big, fat, you know, he could have done something along those lines.  I don't know what.  Whatever he wanted to.  Well, free styling.  Why not?  This is live.  It's not taped.  I hope Joy Behar gets, you know, however he wanted to phrase it.  That would be completely up to him.  I'm not a rapper.  Really?  What were you to say?  You're just giving them the thought starter.  Yeah.  My thoughts ain't smaller.  Yours are bigger.  Star Jones really is a fat.  I mean, I wish I had it.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  I'm not good at writing.  You have to hide out within some good music. 
[03:11:00]  Hey, set up.  I'm just throwing out some.  Well, Condé West talks about that fine word right here.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Let's see what he has to say about it.  I was saying the other day to my friends that I feel, you know, I'm not really offended  by the word nigger when white people use the word nigger, but I feel offended when  white people use incorrect English around me.  It's like if they throw a B in the middle of their sentence, I don't be doing this.  You know, like, that feels almost like, that feels equal to like what the word nigger feels 
[03:11:30]  like to other people.  But it's a word that I could never use.  Yeah.  Well, you couldn't use it because you're going to be politically correct when you're on TV  and everybody would like, they have picket signs and stuff.  More than that, I mean, it would be so offensive to me.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, my God, shut up.  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me over the head with a shovel.  Good for him.  You know what?  I like this dude.  He fucking called her out.  Yeah.  Same way Pryor did, by the way, fucking 25 years ago. 
[03:12:00]  I would never use that word.  Yeah.  And then he's like, yeah, because, you know, people would be protesting and stuff.  Not for a second thinking because she wouldn't want to or use it or she's thought it at some  point in her fucking life.  But no, no, because it's just so offensive to me.  You can't say it.  Anybody can say it.  Right.  Anyone can say it.  It can come out of your mouth.  It's just different reactions.  Who can say it?  Oh, my God.  Hold it.  I saw one thing one time. 
[03:12:30]  This man makes a move.  The nigger gets it.  See?  Yes, Bill Burr?  I saw a thing one time where they were just saying someone was going, well, why are people  just mad?  Because there's something that they actually can't do.  Like, all of us are that fucking privileged.  Right.  All those fucking douchebags eating macaroni and cheese in a fucking trailer park.  That's the only thing that they can't do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone's privileged.  Oh, yeah.  So everyone can't say that.  Exactly. 
[03:13:00]  It's just easy.  The government sent you a bag of money and a USA Today every day.  This is what a groveling worm she is.  Why do you have to say that?  Like, I wouldn't say that.  It was so not pertinent to the discussion.  No.  Because the way she said it made it seem like, you know, she was forcing, it was so forced.  His approval.  She felt she had to say it.  If he said something like, look, all white people say that word and say it all the time,  and she went, well, I can never, that's a reaction to what he said.  But he didn't say that. 
[03:13:30]  Not at all.  She's just a fucking groveling, mush-mouthed worm.  Can I hear it again in the context?  I got to hear it again.  It's the hack question you have to say.  I was saying the other day to my friends that I feel, you know, I'm not really offended  by the word nigger when white people use the word nigger, but I feel offended when  white people use incorrect English around me.  It's like if they throw a B in the middle of their sentence, I don't be doing this.  You know, like, that feels almost like, that feels equal to like what the word nigger feels 
[03:14:00]  like to other people.  But it's a word that I could never use.  What?  Who asked?  Well, you couldn't use it because you had to be politically correct when you're on TV  and everybody would, like, have picket signs and stuff.  More than that, I mean, it would be so offensive to me.  That's bullshit.  But who cares?  No one asks.  She finds it offensive.  It's so offensive to her.  To her.  She's one of the special white people.  Holy shit.  You and the Tyra Banks in the fat suit where she made it about her.  Right.  It had to be then again about her. 
[03:14:30]  It's so offensive to me.  It's so offensive to me.  You guys, I was so offended.  Shut up.  Pryor called her out.  I think it was, because she did a thing where she did all her shows and he, I think, three  times did interviews.  Yeah.  And he was arrogant.  He was always a rough interviewer, man.  He was a motherfucker.  And I think he was telling me, you know you say the word nigger.  Say it.  Go ahead.  Say it.  He was, like, taunting it with it.  I wish I could remember what it was, but it was one of his earliest ones when he was still fucking.  I bet she used it when he left that fucking studio.  She said that he angered her.  He really made her angry.  Yeah.  I mean, she said it a few times. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Let's move on.  Some of the fascinating people of 2005, according to Barbara Walters.  And how do you, sorry to interrupt you, how do you not like Kanye West calling people  out for using incorrect English around black people?  Yeah.  White guys do that all the time.  You see the talk one way, like, hey, how are you?  He's like, what's up, man?  And the black guy comes over.  What's up?  What's up?  Why?  Be all wigger.  Be all wiggerly.  But they change their diction, like, from moment to moment.  Yeah.  It's silly.  On stage, I've seen guys do that.  Silly.  Where are you from?  Oh, cool.  Where are you from?  That little subtle, where are you from? 
[03:15:30]  Why?  Yeah.  The black guy won't understand you if you say, where are you from?  You've never done that, though?  Never.  When I was in high school and drinking, and I wore fat laces, and I was a little, yeah.  Leave him alone.  Exactly.  I got what I deserved.  Chased back to my white community with guys with sticks.  Jersey wigger.  We got some highlights.  It depends on how my set's going.  I'll be honest with you.  I've definitely started a bomb in front of a black crowd, and I threw in a couple you-know-what-I'm-sayings.  I've been guilty of that.  But I can't say you-know-what-I'm-saying, because if I said that, that would just be horribly offensive to me. 
[03:16:00]  We got Michael Jackson's lawyer here.  What's his name?  Mark Garagos.  Tom Messero, or Messero, what is his name?  I'm sorry, Mark Garagos.  Who's Mark Garagos?  Well, he was, right?  Did he bail on that case?  I'm not going to work here anymore.  Well, why don't we get into the audio?  You said that you never doubted that you would win the case against Michael Jackson.  Why were you so sure?  Because I thought the case was built on sand. 
[03:16:30]  It was a case built on falsehoods.  It never should have been brought.  And I really thought this jury had what it took to see that.  What do you think would have happened had Jackson been found guilty?  I consider the Michael Jackson case to be a death penalty case.  I did not think Michael Jackson would have survived prison.  Ha.  No kidding.  Kreskin.  That guy's a good lawyer, though.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a genius.  The fact is, kids went into his room.  Their parents were there, too.  The parents were allowed to stay over with the children. 
[03:17:00]  And the way it was mischaracterized and mispresented to try and get a conviction was scandalous.  It was wrong.  By him right there, it was misrepresented.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, the parents were there sometimes, not in the same room.  And Michael Jackson was sleeping with the kids, in his bed, with the kids, without a parent there.  And this guy's now trying to paint a whole new picture.  Like, oh, the parents, everyone's the fucking, the police were sleeping in another bed.  Everyone, everything was hunky-dory.  The guy's a fucking pedophile. 
[03:17:30]  Look.  That's why he left the whole country.  Devil's advocate here.  Oh, stop it.  You got a cute kid.  Your car's not running well.  Why not?  Look, Tommy, can you toughen up for one night?  I don't wanna.  Yeah, we'll have enough money for therapy.  But, Mama, it hurts.  Can't you lay on your stomach in the back of Mama's new Rolls-Royce?  Jesus.  Here's one more clip.  He was really battered emotionally and physically by this five-month trial. 
[03:18:00]  And he has told me that he really loves the environment and loves the people.  Do you think that people will be able to forget this trial and the accusations?  Well, he was vindicated.  He's a great human being and I have no doubt that he'll come back musically if he wants to.  Lawyers are scum.  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, but they are just such scum fucks.  I hate to have to do this, but I wish his kids would be molested by Michael Jackson. 
[03:18:30]  Wouldn't that just be a little bitter irony for this guy?  That would never happen.  Because he would never leave him because he knows this guy's fucking guilty.  Leave your kids over there.  Leave your cute little cherubs over there with Michael Jackson in his island getaway where he's not even under any fucking laws anymore.  God knows what's going on in that place.  Yes, he does.  He bought some island.  Forget about it.  It's probably like the It's a Small World boats pulling up to there every fucking day, dropping a new load of little kids off. 
[03:19:00]  Stop.  The guy's a monster.  He's a fucking monster who's able to sing.  They're acting out the sound of music.  You're running on the hill.  I'm spinning around in a dress.  Do it.  He's fucking kids on the hilltop there just out in public now.  Watch.  Look what I do now.  He's on an island.  This really is Never Never Land.  It's Never Never Land.  You're never going to get me for this motherfucker land.  Doing pills, taping his nose. 
[03:19:30]  All those young little hairless genitals.  How do you not enjoy yourself?  Little hairless pale genitals.  They don't care.  He just doles out some more cash, another boatload.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  All right, well, finally, we got Tom Cruise was one of the top ten fascinating people of 2005.  Barbara Walters sat down with Mr. Cruise, and we have some highlights.  Do you regret anything you said or did? 
[03:20:00]  No.  Not at all.  No, it's truth.  You look at what has occurred over this past year, where you have the kind of labels that have been put on these psychiatric drugs.  Since I started talking out about it and since the Matt Lauer interview, over 465,000 children have come off these.  So I think it's exactly the opposite.  It's been a very successful summer.  It's because of him.  Yeah.  It's because of Tom Cruise.  Where did you get this info, Tom?  Tom Cruise is changing the world. 
[03:20:30]  Where did Tom get that info?  450,000 kids came off of it, although I wouldn't doubt it because there's probably these rube fucking women, these housewives and moms in the Midwest that love Tom Cruise and listen to every word he says and just pull the kids off of the medications.  Tom's knowledgeable.  That's what you got?  Tom knows what he's talking about.  I know.  Anthony, you're glib.  You're very glib.  You're glib.  You don't know the history of psychiatry, Anthony.  He does.  I now understand. 
[03:21:00]  This has been so fast with Katie.  I mean, you just met her last April.  How do you know so fast?  I just knew.  I really just knew.  It was an explosion.  And she's just, she's magic.  And I really, I think that all men should celebrate their women.  They should all jump on couches for them.  I really, when you find that woman, you should absolutely be unabashed about it.  And that's how I feel about it.  That's so sweet.  So I really mean it.  I will forever be jumping on couches. 
[03:21:30]  And now we're going to have, you know, children.  It's beautiful.  Stop trying to take an embarrassing moment and make it like, I'll present this moment as if it was meant to be that way.  I'm just using it figuratively.  I'll be jumping on couches my whole life.  That's right.  That's the last thing you want to do is celebrate the woman you're with.  No.  You're creating a monster.  You're not celebrating the woman you're with.  Wait until fucking ten years after a few kids, you'll be jumping on luggage.  Because that's what she reminds you of.  Just a fucking fat silverback sitting there, not cute anymore. 
[03:22:00]  Stupid cold sore in her mouth.  I don't remember the cold sore.  That was one of my highlights of 2005.  Katie Holmes' cold sore.  Big.  It was more than just one.  That was just covered.  Yeah.  And that was just from eating Tom's ass.  Old twister board mouth.  Maybe tomorrow.  Brand new relationships.  They're just delving into everything.  Diving face first right into ass. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Someone remind us.  For tomorrow's show, the listeners can get involved.  Audience participation.  The real highlights of 2005.  The real highlights.  Yeah.  One of them is definitely Katie Holmes and her cold sore.  Cold sores.  Oof.  Yeah.  That was a little brutal.  Just start calling tomorrow morning right off the bat with that.  Help us out.  You have all night to think of some good ones.  More audio with Tom Cruise.  Okay.  The baby.  Yes.  Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?  No.  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.  You're going to know beforehand. 
[03:23:00]  Yes.  I actually bought a sonogram machine.  And?  I'm going to donate it to a hospital and we're done.  Wait.  You're going to do your own sonogram?  What a guy.  He's just amazing.  So you know whether it's a boy or a girl.  Don't you?  No.  I don't.  I think.  But you're looking at this.  Barbara.  I would tell you.  I would say I know if it's a boy or a girl and I'm not telling you.  Okay.  I would say that.  Could you not stop this captivating interview?  I was so just fixated on every word.  He had to say he's giving it to a hospital. 
[03:23:30]  You know?  He had to add that in.  Just to show what a great guy he is.  I bought a sonogram machine.  Yeah.  I could do that.  Oh.  I'm giving it to a hospital.  But when we're done with it.  I've read all about sonogram machines.  Yeah.  And he's using it on her.  Dr. Tom Cruise.  That is just creepy.  That sounds a little dangerous.  It's very creepy.  Yeah.  Honey, the head's big and the tongue is hanging out.  Is that normal?  Yeah.  Maybe you should just leave that to doctors that could see if it's going to be okay or come 
[03:24:00]  out of a complete disaster.  Yeah.  You might want to know early on.  You don't want to find that out eight months in.  No.  It's not going to be smart.  Oh, this ain't going to be good, Tom.  Remember how we talked about you want to do it, find out in the first three months.  Right.  And the old foot comes out by the steps.  As we call it, the old whoops-a-daisy.  The old whoops-a-daisy.  Or paging Doc Martin, paging Doc Martin, you're due at surgery at the top of the stairs. 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  Oh, I forgot about treat that belly like a beanbag, Jared.  Just sit on it.  Whoops.  Wow.  Collapse a note and watch the game.  Visit the offices of Doc Martin.  One more clip from Mr. Cruz.  Is there a Scientology way of having birth?  Like anything, you want to be as quiet as possible.  And I know there's been misinterpretation in terms of the woman can't make any noise. 
[03:25:00]  I mean, that's just not true.  Bullshit.  It's nutty.  No.  But just calm and quiet.  I want Kate to be as comfortable as possible.  And whatever she's going to go through, she's going to go through.  And I'm going to be there.  If she makes a noise, she makes a noise.  Oh, she's going to make noise, I'm sure.  Is he going to allow her to have Kate killers?  I don't know.  You know, we're going to go through it.  No medication like that.  Everything.  If I was Kate Holmes' father, I would kill this fucking guy. 
[03:25:30]  Why?  Quite a paycheck.  Yeah.  He's probably making out pretty well.  You whore out one of your daughters, you're fine.  But she already has money.  She has an all right career.  She don't have Tom Cruise money.  Don't you fucking snub that Dawson Creek money.  Yeah, I'll allow the Dawson money.  Right on, Bill.  Nicole Kidman.  All right, Val.  Yeah.  You guaranteed to be a star for life.  Set for life, dude.  Yeah.  Fucking set for life.  But you're a star.  You're photographed every five minutes.  If you're like his wife, if you're linked with Cruise like that, 
[03:26:00]  I mean, that's how famous he is.  Nicole Kidman, who's a good career.  Oh, that's great.  She'll do a movie with him.  That's worth having birth with no drugs.  Yeah, why not?  Finally, we didn't get to this yesterday, the Gary Glitter update.  Gary Glitter.  Last we heard, when last we left Gary, he was in Southeast Asia up on child rape charges,  which carry the death penalty over there.  And we're not talking any 20 years of appeal death penalty.  We're talking guilty, you're dead. 
[03:26:30]  Hey!  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Hey!  Just done.  Electricity?  Are you insane?  They probably just lop your head off over there.  I bet you they got the best way to guilty.  That's the right way to do it.  Playing a drum roll like in Papillon.  Yeah.  Nice little drum roll, and then...  Yeah, they don't do it the sweet way over there.  Vietnamese police will formally charge British glam rocker Gary Glitter with child molestation  and drop an additional charge of child rape, his Vietnamese lawyer said yesterday. 
[03:27:00]  Police have said medical tests on girls who alleged they had had sex with the 1970s rock icon.  Why is he a rock icon?  He had one stupid hit.  One song.  Who was arrested last month led them to look into the more serious charge of raping children,  which can carry the death penalty.  There you have it.  It should.  I think there's some more info on this story today.  Supposedly he paid off one of the family's $2,000.  Yeah, like too large over there in Vietnam is a lot of cake.  Just $2,000 to get off the hook. 
[03:27:30]  Is he done?  Is he out?  Well, he's going to spend some time in jail.  Well, he's still got the child molestation charge there.  Vietnam is just all that whole area is known.  People go there to have sex with children, and this guy can't even do that right.  But he can't even – he's such a creep that he doesn't even know how to go about that discreetly in a country that just – that's what they do over there.  Yeah.  That's actually in their tourism brochure.  Right.  It's a picture of a kid crying. 
[03:28:00]  Fucking savage people.  Protect your own kids.  He had so much child porn on his computer when he got arrested in England for it, and his computer broke, and he brought it to a repair shop, to a computer repair shop.  And, like, literally children fell out of his computer.  Nude children were what was jamming up the works.  You got Similac in the J. King.  Wow.  Wow.  This guy is a monster, a predator.  He's not going to be rehabilitated by this Vietnamese justice for $2,000 to pay the family off. 
[03:28:30]  Get rid of him.  So what?  He made a song.  You should rent out the cabana at Michael Jackson's new place.  There you go.  He's going to be moving over there.  Let's go to Pat in Boston.  Pat, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned a couple things.  I learned that King Kong is better behaved than Mike Tyson, and that Trav is the promo homo.  All right.  Travis has learned that.  Josh in Arkansas.  I learned that Anthony needs an additional towel for his cock. 
[03:29:00]  Todd the Trucker.  Morning, guys.  I learned that Jimmy has a hot ass, and Bill Burkensit if he wants to the lucky fella.  Hey, Jimmy, are you going to be able to make it to CES?  Yes, I am going to be in Vegas with the boys, sir.  All right.  Good deal.  We'll see you guys there.  Thanks, man.  We'll be in Vegas next week.  Ben's raw ass.  Hey, I learned it's 2006 when the bank touches the chin.  That's right.  Bill Burkensit, thanks for stopping in.  I think he's going to be taking a flight.  He doesn't even know.  It's what's the name of the club? 
[03:29:30]  It's Kickers.  It's Livonia, Michigan.  Right.  For New Year's Eve.  All weekend long.  Starting maybe tonight.  Allegedly.  Only tomorrow.  Yes.  So, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Sunday?  You got to do that Sunday show, too?  No, no.  All right.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Livonia, Michigan.  Possibly Wednesday, no Sunday.  That's right.  Bill will make up his mind after the show whether or not he comes.  Yeah.  Let's go to Dave in Texas.  Dave.  Really?  I love that Katie Holmes is Twister Board Mouth.  We love you, Jimmy.  Bye, sir.  See you tomorrow.  Catch it.  I'm out of here. 
[03:30:00]  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
