<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a surprise visit from Snoop (from HBO's *The Wire*).  He shared details of his past life, including his criminal history, a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence, and the subsequent difficulties in finding employment due to his record.  He also discussed his transition into acting, his tattoos, and the unwavering support of his uncle during his incarceration. Snoop promoted his book, *Grace After Midnight*.

Following Snoop's departure, the show shifted to a discussion of producer Derek ("D-Boy"), focusing on his self-destructive tendencies while intoxicated, particularly his habit of smashing his phone and deleting data from his computer.  This segued into playing clips of a secretly recorded conversation with Master Poe, a former security guard, whose absurdly literal and overly cautious hurricane evacuation plan provided considerable comedic fodder.

The hosts then engaged in a debate about E-Rock's infuriatingly poor texting skills, with Opie leading the criticism, characterizing them as indicative of stupidity rather than genuine attempts at friendly communication.  Others in the studio offered differing perspectives.

A segment featuring Boardroom Jimmy, a recurring comedic character played by one of the hosts, offered absurd stock market analysis, recommending investments in sugar and fish oil.  The host portraying Boardroom Jimmy revealed difficulty maintaining the character's voice and persona.

Ron Bennington then joined the show, contributing to a discussion about producer Mark Zito, who was found relaxing in Anthony's chair.  The conversation expanded to encompass Zito's work ethic and laid-back approach to his production duties, alongside commentary about producer Roland's guest booking. The show concluded with a discussion of Michael Madsen's recent appearance and subsequent publicized financial difficulties.

I know you as Snoop.  Snoop, how you feeling?  Sit down.  Hey, we're doing gang signs or something.  This has been another celebrity Twitter reading from Ira the Weatherman.  Can you hear us?  Because we're having a race conversation.  So it's just funny that we walked over there.  We're talking about Barack fucking professor.  Gates, Louis Gates Jr.  I was trying to describe to him what Louis Gates Jr. 
[00:01:00]  told me.  And so Louis is the guy who's talking about this.  Look at me.  I know.  I've been through it.  It's like when the cops come to his house.  I have walked the Louis Gates Jr. walk.  I know just what it's like.  No, I don't know.  Your hair looks good, by the way.  Thanks, buddy.  Thanks.  I say that because in The Wire, how's my hair look?  Yeah.  Played one of the greatest characters ever on The Wire, Snoop.  Holy shit.  You were a scary motherfucker on that show. 
[00:01:30]  Holy shit.  It was TV.  It was the scripts, man.  I had to do what I was paid for, man.  You know?  Jimmy's going to be so bummed he's not here today.  Jimmy's going to be so pissed.  It's good.  It's like his favorite show, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  When he's filming a movie in Boston.  He'll be back tomorrow.  Music, I just had an interview over there.  Music, television, reality show ready to come up.  Which one?  What are you doing?  Just trying to help kids get on the right track.  Just like T.I. wrote to Redemption. 
[00:02:00]  I'm going to switch it up in my own flavor.  So going all over the world.  Just helping kids out in the ghetto.  Go ahead.  Say, that's good.  Where are you from, man?  What's that accent?  Where are you from?  Baltimore.  Wow, man.  It's different than Sal, my stepfather's accent.  No, Baltimore is the South.  Baltimore is the South.  It's the start of the South.  Yeah, it's just where it starts.  Sal sure doesn't sound like that.  No.  You were discovered on the streets, right?  Yeah, I'm in a nightclub.  Michael K. Williams played a character, Omar. 
[00:02:30]  Sure.  And he told me, come on through.  I came on through.  And here I am.  Make a long story short.  Just like that.  His whole life changed.  Because Omar was in the same place.  That was God, though, man.  Sure enough.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  I was on the road to Woo.  The road to Woo.  The road to Woo.  Woo is just south of Baltimore, I think.  The road to Woo.  Yeah, you were in the game and shit?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, that was my past life.  You know, selling drugs.  Trying to make a life for myself, you know?  And just put money in my pocket.  You know, I tried to do the right thing.  You know, I was incarcerated.  Tried to do the right thing.  How many years?  Six and a half years.  Holy.  So you went to jail and you tried to change when you came home, you're saying?  Yeah.  And they just downplayed me, man.  You know what I mean?  It was just crazy.  They just fired me.  Every three, I mean, all three jobs.  They what did you?  They fired me. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, fired you.  Yeah.  I had three jobs.  They fired me.  I said, man, fuck this, man.  I'm going on the block.  I'm going to get it in, man.  And you went back to crime?  Hustling.  Yeah.  How old were you then?  Damn, man.  How old were you then?  What, when I came home?  Yeah, when you came home, how old were you?  21.  And then you had three jobs?  Yeah.  Went back.  And how long did those three jobs?  I was working for Ford and all.  Like, making Ford bumpers.  You know what I mean?  Making $16 an hour.  Yeah, I was just coming home.  I was living the life.  What did they fire you for?  Because of my background, my criminal background, you know? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, they found out or some shit?  Yeah, but I said it on my job, on my application.  Like, I mean, you know how they got the question, have you ever been incarcerated?  I put yes, explain, and interview.  You know what I mean?  And they still hired me, but two weeks later, they fired me.  I said, damn, at least I got one paycheck.  What were the other, you worked for Ford?  What were the other two jobs?  Um, what, the, um, book company, and, um, stacking boxes. 
[00:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  God damn, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did you get the tats?  In prison?  No, no, I waited until I came home.  I wanted to try and catch enough.  They look too good.  They look too good to be a prison tats.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Good thing you steered clear of those things.  Rusty needle.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  Those things always look like shit.  Who is that?  Who's Arnold?  That's my uncle, man.  Your uncle?  Yeah, he passed away while I was locked up, you know?  That was like, you know, when you think, well, you don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Y'all don't know.  No.  When you're incarcerated, you know, all your friends and, like, half of your family just,  you know, disappear on you.  And it's the man that...  He stayed with you?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, visits, phone calls, money, all this, all that, you know?  So, he wouldn't meet you on my dying day, you know?  Yeah.  That must have meant a lot.  Yeah, yeah, it did.  Obviously.  Going to get a tad.  Yeah, of course I know.  Yeah, he's a tad.  Yeah, he's a guy I kind of knew once.  I got a tattoo of a guy he gave me, you know?  I talk about that in Grace After Midnight. 
[00:05:30]  I got a book out called Grace After Midnight.  It's in Barnes and Noble's.  Amazon.com.  It's in reprint right now, you know what I mean?  Right on.  And I'm writing my second one.  And some kid is stacking that book in a box somewhere.  In Baltimore.  Where you used to work.  God damn, we don't even have any time left right now.  Yeah, I just have you back, man.  I just ran in and said hello, man.  Snoop, I love you, man.  You got to come back when Jimmy's here.  Yeah.  Jimmy will shit his pants.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  He will.  Loves the wire.  I love Snoop.  I'm going to put them all black and run down on them, man.  All right.  I'll see y'all later, man.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks, Snoop.  Okay, man.  Very cool.  It's Jimmy's.  I guess.  Oh, man.  I saw this yesterday for Jim, man.  Are you only signing one for Jimmy?  I don't know.  No, I'm signing it again for him.  I don't know.  Yeah, you never know.  Because I did Casey Slade last night.  Jimmy will be like, I'll take two.  Winking.  Blinking.  What a psychopath he is.  That's cool, man. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  Well, you got scared because...  I'm like, God damn.  She was giving you all sorts of signs outside the window.  All right, man.  What's up, man?  Let's see you all later.  See you, man.  Nice to meet you.  Take it easy.  It was a good show, you guys, today.  Yeah.  Louie, you fucking...  I love listening to Louie CK.  He's got a way of looking at things.  Did I say he?  Who said he?  Who said he?  All of us said he?  I didn't say he.  Was I the only one?  I know it's not a he. 
[00:07:00]  That's a man and dude.  Yeah.  But I didn't mean like man or dude.  That's a man.  No, that's a she.  I knew that too, but I think I might have slipped too.  That's a girl.  Okay.  She was a nice girl.  Yeah.  She was a nice guy.  Officially, who said he instead of she?  I think I got one out.  Huh?  Louie did too.  What did I say?  You said he.  To him?  Yeah.  To her.  To that? 
[00:07:30]  God damn.  No, I was just saying.  How did I say he?  You said he.  Louie said he.  I was right there too.  Okay, you said he.  That's why at the end I said, she was giving gang signs to Anthony.  Holy shit.  We are assholes.  Wait, so she got out of jail at 21.  21, had three jobs.  Wait, wait, wait.  But before that, she was in for six and a half years, so she went in at 14, 14 and a half?  Young.  Damn.  What'd she do?  Well, from what I was told.  She was convicted of attempted murder. 
[00:08:00]  Holy shit.  At 14.  It's just attempted.  I can't believe Anthony called her a him.  I did not.  I was just saying, yeah, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, dude.  Wow.  I called girls, dude.  Yeah, just like that intern when she was leaving, right?  No.  See you later, dude.  No.  I was gay.  I didn't.  You're right, Danny.  Wow.  Strange.  Yeah.  That was funny timing.  The whole thing.  It certainly was.  After the whole conversation we had.  Let's meet a black-on-black violent. 
[00:08:30]  Let's meet one now.  Let's meet one of questionable sexuality.  You ever ask anybody for 50 cents in a not-so-nice way?  Probably.  Probably.  Probably.  Probably.  Attempt a murder.  Interesting.  Attempt a murder.  Right there, Louie.  This is why Vietnam vets that were in prison meet their torturers and everybody cries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why you torturers.  I didn't know you had a...  Oh.  Now I get it. 
[00:09:00]  I see.  Your mom wasn't nice to you.  Well, it's fine then.  And you were fired.  You tried to go straight, and that's why you're slinging a rock back on the street again.  And then her manager at Ford would be like, that's not what fucking happened.  Fuck her.  Let me tell you.  I gave her a shot.  Why do you think I hired her?  The fuck?  We fucking...  We never lost so many bumpers in a week in my life.  Many fucking bumpers over each shoulder.  God knows.  Fuck.  You won't buy a bumper? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I'll sell you a bumper.  She'll come back.  Yeah.  You didn't see The Wire, really?  No, I'm not up to that point.  I never saw it.  Oh, my God.  Not up to that point.  Fucking intimidate.  Wow.  Barely acting, though, because they got it right off the streets of Baltimore.  Yeah.  Every...  You know, that's the thing.  It's like every time...  When you boil the crazy, fucked up America down to the individual, it just changes how  you look at it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Every person has their different weird story.  After O&A, it's live.  You bet it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live, I'm Sam Roberts. 
[00:10:00]  That was Snoop from The Wire.  There...  She was on the show.  It was a random occurrence, but we pulled her in.  She's now in legal trouble, but she says she's not guilty, so I gotta believe her.  There's no reason not to.  Hopefully, she'll be fine.  We talked to Derek D-Boy at the top of After Opie and Anthony Live, and he is very elusive.  He's not hungry for the mic.  He doesn't like to say things publicly, mainly because he's a weirdo.  But there was a story that came up on the air today about him smashing his phone because 
[00:10:30]  his computer didn't work.  Uh, I didn't know how much sense that made, so we tried to get some clarification from  D-Boy earlier on today.  Derek, you smashed your phone?  I certainly did.  What'd you do that for?  My computer crashed.  What sense does that make?  It was the first thing that was available to throw, actually.  Did your computer crash, or did you get drunk and just delete everything off of it?  Well, I was drunk, but it crashed when I was drunk, and then everything got deleted. 
[00:11:00]  What do you mean everything got deleted?  Well, I don't know what happened, but I lost everything.  So you woke up in the morning and your phone was smashed, and your computer was empty?  No, no, I remember smashing it drunk.  You know, I...  But you're not sure about the computer?  No.  You think that's a problem?  Yes.  Derek is the guy who's responsible for all of the production here on Opie and Anthony,  so obviously he's a lunatic.  And yeah, he does like to drink, and the thing that we've discovered about Derek is that 
[00:11:30]  when he drinks, he goes home and deletes things.  Like, he'll drink, and then he'll delete his Facebook.  Or he'll drink and decide to clear out every picture of his hard drive.  He has a Gmail address, and he deletes all old mail,  completely ignoring the fact that the whole point of Gmail is all the storage space.  But he refuses now.  He's right outside the studio, and he refuses to come in.  Eric, have you heard about D-Boy's habits of when he drinks and just tries to make his life nothing, 
[00:12:00]  so he wakes up in the morning and everything's gone?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's been stories for years of Derek breaking DVDs, furniture.  The phone is brand new.  There's been times where he's found liquids on his kitchen floor,  but he doesn't know where they came from.  So he mops them up like a champion.  As a matter of fact, one of these days, not today, but soon here on After ONA,  we'll play The Time Derek and Danny Got Drunk on Pal Talk. 
[00:12:30]  We haven't played that in a while.  So we'll write that down and play it maybe later this week if we have time.  But there was something else I wanted to get into,  because earlier today we were talking about Poe's Law.  Nobody quite knew what that was,  but everybody in the studio started making references to our old security guard, Master Poe.  And I realize that there are a lot of you out there listening to After Opie and Anthony Live  who don't know who Master Poe is or remember him fondly 
[00:13:00]  and wish that they could still hear some of those bids.  Master Poe was our security guard when we were at 57th Street.  And, I mean, there were times when he came off as just a bumbling fool.  He got very mad at quite a few staff members on quite a few occasions.  I suffered the wrath of Poe.  Travis definitely suffered the wrath of Poe.  I have.  Danny did.  Yeah, you did.  He hated the interns.  But that's because he was this guy who just talked about being a ninja all the time or something. 
[00:13:30]  He was always talking about something to do with some kind of martial arts,  but nobody ever saw him actually do any of it.  So we decided one day, and, again, we were talking about Poe's Law,  I just want to make sure everybody's up to speed with who Master Poe is  and that everybody who already is up to speed can enjoy Master Poe again,  because it's been a while.  When did Poe leave? 2009?  2009?  Yeah.  Master Poe would have left a few months before we came over to this building. 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  So it would have been about two and a half years ago since Master Poe has been with us.  Wow.  And we don't even know what happened to him.  He stopped talking to all of us, but probably for good reason, and reasons like we're about to play.  Master Poe, a few years ago, this was going back.  This is back to 2005, I think, Iraq, do you know?  Yeah, this is 2005.  It was just after Hurricane Katrina hit.  Right, right.  And so we were thinking, okay, here's what we'll do.  We'll secretly record Master Poe, and we'll talk to him about how we would, what's our emergency plan for a hurricane? 
[00:14:30]  How to get out of New York if a hurricane is coming.  Now, most serious security guards would look at you and be like, look, this isn't my job.  This is a foolish question.  But Master Poe, number one, took everything seriously.  Number two, could never tell when people were making fun of him.  Number three, took everything that was free.  Yeah, and also took everything that was free.  So he decided to sit down.  I believe he was actually sitting down with our former whatever producer, Steve C., at the time. 
[00:15:00]  He sat down with Master Poe and secretly recorded as Master Poe gave us an emergency evacuation plan in case of a hurricane.  Here it is.  Master Poe returns thanks to After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  So Martini Steve is in the studio.  And you interviewed Master Poe?  Well, yeah, we were talking about the potential for a hurricane to actually hit Manhattan. 
[00:15:30]  And I wanted to know what the evacuation plan would be if, God forbid, a hurricane hit while we were all in the building.  Uh-huh.  So we're up here quite a few feet off street level.  Right.  Also, by the way, we are on the highest point in Manhattan.  This is, you know, right where we are.  Right.  It's downhill anywhere you go. 
[00:16:00]  It's like east side, west side.  You're going downhill.  Right.  Uh, I don't think we'd get the type of flooding here that we saw in New Orleans, which is below sea level.  Well, you have to be prepared.  And I just really wanted to hear what the plan might be.  Why is Master Poe giving you a look right now?  I don't know.  What's wrong, Master Poe?  Well, because we were having a discussion and he was just asking me his advice because he said his wife was nervous.  Didn't know that he was being recorded.  For you, we're recording me. 
[00:16:30]  I certainly was.  Oh, yeah.  This was, yeah, Master Poe, I had no idea we were going to.  This is a scandal.  It's not exactly the most, the most, uh, the easiest interview to conduct considering the fact that, you know, I know full well that this place is well above sea level and I'm not an idiot.  We're five floors up.  Yeah.  Well, but Master Poe takes everything seriously.  Right.  And you said that you wanted to leave.  You're talking evacuation.  Now, how would we evacuate?  I think the safest place would be just to stay put here.  Right.  We'd probably stay on the air.  And just have a little fun. 
[00:17:00]  That's right.  If there was a hurricane, we couldn't leave.  I think, uh.  Well, what happens if the power goes out and there's a hurricane?  All right, now the power goes out.  Right.  Auxiliary power kicks on.  We're back on the air.  All right.  Well, so, uh, Steve interviewed Master Poe and we got some audio.  Master Poe had no idea we were interviewing him.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean, there's apparently a, uh, I guess, I guess there's actually.  Steve, you're the biggest pussy.  What?  I can hear that you're nervous. 
[00:17:30]  No, I'm trying not to crack up.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I don't, I'm not afraid of what Poe's going to do if he happens to get angry and, you  know, knock my head off.  You kind of have a nervousness to your voice, like, oh God, I hope I don't piss him off.  No, no, no.  It's, oh God, I hope I don't crack up.  All right, all right.  There's apparently a, uh, I guess, I guess there's, I guess there's, because he's like  slamming things around like, oh God, I hope this goes okay.  He can never infiltrate the mob.  Right.  He'd find the wire in like two seconds.  Yeah, exactly.  He's getting a little nervous. 
[00:18:00]  From his voice, you can tell something's up already.  He's slamming.  Right.  He's like, look at his life.  I am, I am trying to desperately.  The sweat's pouring off his forehead.  Yeah, desperately trying to maintain my composure while asking questions without bursting into  fucking laughter.  You're right, Steve.  No, I'm not wearing a wire.  He just loses it immediately.  I'm just a little wired.  I mean, it's tight.  You're right.  Listen how natural Steve comes across.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan. 
[00:18:30]  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean, there's apparently a, uh, uh, ha ha.  It sounds like it's written like bad acting.  Like they're reading a script.  Apparently I'm supposed to, I am sorry?  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean, there's apparently a, uh, uh, I guess, I guess there's actually now concern  of this hurricane.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:19:00]  You're kidding me.  What are they saying?  If.  When is it hitting?  If in the event that it hits this area, what is.  The.  I guess.  Uh.  I guess what would your recommendation.  Holy shit Steve.  That is not a guy that thinks he's going to crack.  This is, uh, I guess.  That's not a guy that's going to crack up at any moment.  I'm trying to think how to phrase it.  Yeah, I'm really just trying to think how to phrase it because I walked into this cold.  I'm not buying it. 
[00:19:30]  What, you think I'm afraid?  You honestly think I'm frightened?  I think you're frightened.  I'm sorry.  Bill?  Inactive.  Frightened or is.  I don't know.  It sounds like, uh, bad soap opera acting.  I think, yeah, that's what I think it is.  It's just bad acting.  Yeah, horrible acting.  And the fact that maybe he's a little shook up that this is being recorded.  Right.  Yeah.  And he knows that his side is going to be on this also.  Yeah.  So he's got to perform.  And maybe he'll be the one getting made fun of.  I would, I would, I would agree with Anthony on that one.  It's, it's, it's, I would, I would totally fess up to bad acting and totally fess up to  knowing it was being recorded.  Well, Poe, you've come back. 
[00:20:00]  Rachel.  A string of peloponies.  It's awful acting.  It's really bad.  I guess, what would your recommendation be for an evacuation plan to get everybody out  of here?  Okay.  First, we have to find out when is it going to hit?  I would assume. 
[00:20:30]  And six hours before it hits, we're out of here.  Okay.  One hour before it hits.  Six hours before it hits.  Now, okay.  Why six hours?  What would that time frame allow?  Well, I was involved with Hurricane Floyd and I stayed.  You kicked his ass, right?  Yeah.  We, we stayed.  Top kick right to the eye.  Take care of that problem.  No, we stayed in the house and we tried to fight this hurricane and that was stupid. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um, the best thing for you to do is to get rid of your, or take your clothing, your  electronics.  Well, we'll listen to the tape.  I just want to know why the six hours.  That's all.  Because six hours also sounds kind of dangerous.  Like, then you're out of the building on a crowded evacuating road as the storm hits.  All right.  Let's listen.  I don't know.  Let's listen.  Who am I to say while he's sitting next to me?  Because if anybody has ever experienced being in a hurricane, it's one of the worst things 
[00:21:30]  ever.  Now, you guys were up on top of this building and, and, you know, if we stay here, most  likely nothing's going to happen.  However, depending on where we live, we may have to do some preparations in our homes.  Okay.  Make some preparations.  I know I will definitely have to make some preparations.  All right.  So far, so good.  Fairly normal.  We'll move on here.  If by chance that we are hit by a hurricane, let's say now. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And the best thing for us to do is to stay here.  Stay here?  Well, it's too late.  The hurricane hit us.  If it's that bad.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Because you know what's going to happen is you're getting, okay, you won't be able to  get a taxi.  You won't be able to get a train.  And it'll be difficult for you to get out of New York City.  Anthony will not, it's going to take him four and a half hours to get home.  So that's why we have to stay watch of this hurricane.  If by chance the hurricane is going to hit us, then we have to be ahead of it. 
[00:22:30]  If the hurricane is going to hit us at two o'clock, then we have to get out of here three,  four hours, preferably ahead of time.  How much time for a slowy cane, though?  Because I would assume you got more time.  No, that was wrong.  I was wrong.  If the hurricane is going to hit, just stay home.  Stay home.  Stay home.  We'd have enough advance notice.  So have you done any research on this shit, or he just came in and asked the question,  and you just went with it? 
[00:23:00]  No, I was hit by a hurricane.  I was hit by a hurricane very bad.  I lost my home in 99.  We got a comedian coming up this weekend.  This is my home life.  Now the funny.  But when Steve asked you, it's pretty much cold.  You didn't know that you were going into this meeting to discuss evacuation.  No, he said his wife was concerned.  Yeah.  All right, let's continue listening here.  Hurricane liver cirrhosis, maybe she'd be concerned with.  Like, you know, say it's 7 o'clock in the morning, and we get, you know, a heads up. 
[00:23:30]  Guys, get out of Dodge.  Go now.  What do we do?  How do we get open at home?  How do we get...  What we should have outside...  Okay, Anthony is going to be driving home himself.  I would assume.  I don't know.  Opie is probably going to need to be driven home.  He's not going to take a taxi or...  Roller blades.  I mean, if the hurricane is that bad, then we would take him home. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, look at that.  You got taken home.  Just let the hurricane blow me home.  I don't have to use my legs when I'm rollerblading.  You could put on your blades, and the breeze would whisk you home.  Whisk me home.  Really nice and fast.  I guess the question is, let's...  God forbid if we're all stuck here for...  Okay, let's say we're all stuck in this...  What we should do is have provisions.  We should have our flashlights.  We should have our food. 
[00:24:30]  We should definitely have our water.  And we should have extra amount of that.  Now, honestly, if the hurricane is that bad, we can see it on television.  We say, okay, well, guess what, guys?  We shouldn't be here.  It's going to hit New York City this date.  Do not be here.  Because this is going to be a deadlock.  You won't be able to get in and out of the city.  9-11, same thing.  You couldn't get in and out of the city.  Right, right, right.  And the problem is that, okay, you have a hurricane, so now you have wind. 
[00:25:00]  Is it a tropical storm?  The water's coming down so hard.  You're driving, and then you're stopped because the rain is coming down so hard,  people can't even see in front of them.  That's how bad it gets.  Painting quite the picture.  Someone had a really good instant feedback about, basically, something about Steve asking  Master Bonin to talk louder into his lapel. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know the exact line.  Jesus Christ.  Just the worst fucking guy.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  After ONA Live.  It's After ONA Live.  That was Master Poe.  You just got to love somebody who is so, I don't know, daft that he doesn't understand  when people are making fun of him to that level.  But for that reason alone, we all miss him here at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:26:00]  Now, we have been checking Jim's flight.  There was a lot of talk about the plane.  By the way, that sound in the background is the Ron and Fez rug setting up.  The Ron and Fez Show is going to be a big show today, I'm sure of it, because it always is.  Yes, we've been checking Jim Norton's plane status, and he is departing on time.  There was a lot of talk about his plane crashing, which was just probably not good karma to do.  But it was done anyway.  Another topic on the show today that was brought up throughout the show, really, 
[00:26:30]  was E-Rock's texting patterns.  Opie said that E-Rock basically writes horrible texts that just frustrate him,  and I caught up with Opie as he was leaving to better clarify where exactly he was coming from on that.  Opie, you brought up E-Rock's awful texting on the air.  Do you think it really is just trying to pursue a friendship that's not there?  I would hate to give him that much credit.  I know Jimmy Nant said that's what he's doing. 
[00:27:00]  He's trying to engage you in conversation.  But I think he's just truly that stupid.  You just think he's dumb.  Yes, because he texted me last night.  He goes, hey, you watching the news?  And I wrote back.  I know we covered it on the show.  I wrote back, wow, another cryptic message from my friend Eric.  And he got really mad.  So he's just a dope.  I think he's just a dope.  A sensitive, stupid guy.  Yeah, he's not smart enough to know in this day and age with us all on our smartphones and such 
[00:27:30]  that you want to get right into conversations.  You don't want to start a conversation with, hey.  Because then the person has to write back, what?  And then the person finally says, are you watching the news?  Why should I be watching the news?  Well, something really bad happened in Japan.  You could have, like, blew off all those steps and just wrote,  hey, something really bad happened in Japan.  A nuclear power plant just exploded.  That's one text.  It sounds like he's defeating the purpose of text messaging and just doing phone conversations over text. 
[00:28:00]  He's either really lonely or really stupid.  I'm going with really stupid.  But the guys are thinking he's lonely and he's just trying to engage in a conversation.  He's trying to develop a friendship through a smartphone.  You think he could be both, lonely and stupid?  Uh, lonely, stupid, and fat.  Now, some of that might not have been, uh, uh, uh, that doesn't even, that doesn't sound like Eric. 
[00:28:30]  So some of that might not have been 100% necessary.  But, uh, E-Rock, your texting has come up.  People are wandering around.  So Roland, you are obviously a master of impressions, but you text with E-Rock, correct?  I do.  Now, for you, Opie basically just said that his texting style, he's actually just stupid and doesn't realize he's so bad at communicating.  That's what Opie said.  How do you feel when you're texting back and forth with E-Rock?  It's fine.  It's normal text.  Then again, you don't speak normally either. 
[00:29:00]  That is correct.  Right, so does your kind of speech pattern reflect in your text messages?  You bet your sweet tits.  So you, like, reading a text conversation between you and E-Rock would probably not be the most fluid thing in the world.  Possibly.  Troy is right here.  Actually, it's a lot easier, because then I can understand what he's saying.  Oh, as opposed to when you talk to him in person.  Yes.  Ouch.  Troy, you've known Eric for a long time.  Yes.  Did you hear what Opie just said about his texting?  I mean, he said it, talked about it on the air, but then just now he said it a little more succinctly,  that he feels that E-Rock is so shitty at texting because he is so stupid. 
[00:29:30]  That's what Opie said, E-Rock.  I'm not, that's not my opinion.  No, he didn't say that.  You embellished on that.  He said, also, he's fat.  He said, oh, that's right.  No, that was Roland.  Opie said that E-Rock is stupid, fat, and lonely.  Okay.  And that it has a lot to do with his texting style.  You've known Eric for longer than anyone on this show.  Right.  Do you think Opie was accurate with his assessment of the way E-Rock communicates?  Yeah, he's poor at communicating on some things, especially text messaging.  I get annoyed at people's text messaging, especially when everybody likes to talk in text speak 
[00:30:00]  where they leave out, you know, leave out certain things to abbreviate.  Yeah.  And Eric is the king of that.  So sometimes he'll say something, I won't even know what the hell he just said to me.  Except Eric, like, leaves out things that it's to abbreviate, but now the sentence makes  no sense anymore.  Exactly.  Like, they're not things, they're details.  Exactly.  So it's not an abbreviation.  Important details to the text.  Eric.  He's, not Troy, but Opie's upset because it robs him of the ability to ignore whatever  it is that I sent him.  But Eric, at the same time, you do text me, and you'll start the conversation with a single 
[00:30:30]  text that just says the word, hey.  Like, a text from you just says, hey, and I have to say, hi, Eric.  This is where we've come to, hey annoys people now?  Well, you're not supposed to send a text that just says, hey.  You send a text like, hey, could you do this for me?  Not wait for me to respond to, hey.  You know what I'm saying?  So impatient.  Oh, God.  Well, not all of us have so much free time as you, I guess.  That is true.  What type of...  I also think Eric really just wants to show Opie how important he is and just looking for 
[00:31:00]  any excuse to have any sort of conversation with him.  But Opie sees right through it.  Yes.  Roland?  I was just watching TV.  Oh, okay.  You go back to watching TV.  Eric, do you think there are flaws to the way you communicate, or is it everybody else?  Early on, yes, because I didn't realize I did it.  Yeah.  But then I became aware of it.  Yesterday, it happened to be that it broke on TV.  I was watching it.  Texted, hey, are you watching the news?  Then forgot to finish the thought while I was still watching television.  Okay.  I saw the light blinking, and then he goes, another, you know, vague message from my friend 
[00:31:30]  Eric, and then I wrote, how is that, you know, being vague, knowing that I pissed him  off already?  You forgot the...  So maybe he was right with the stupid thing.  At that point, yes.  Okay.  And did it make you feel good when he referred to you as his friend Eric?  Were you like, Opie thinks I'm his friend?  No, because it's condescending.  And I know he's sitting there like, what is this asshole bothering me with now?  Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't text me and said, look what this asshole just texted  me.  Oh, he does that when you text him. 
[00:32:00]  He said a fat asshole.  That's what...  About Eric?  Yes.  No, he did not say that.  Eric, it wasn't the E-Rock texting show today, although it did come up quite a bit.  As you said, they had to get to 10 o'clock somehow.  But Jim was here for the first couple hours anyway, and we almost saw the return of Boardroom  Jimmy.  It wasn't quite the Boardroom Jimmy that we've come to know and love, but for those of you  who know Boardroom Jimmy, you know... 
[00:32:30]  Are you looking into it a bit?  Of course, that's what I'm doing, Roland.  That's what we do here.  You know the potential that Boardroom Jimmy has to entertain.  And for those of you that don't know, you're about to find out.  You may want to check your phone.  Me?  Yeah.  What does it say?  Hey?  Let's see.  I just got a text message.  It's hey from Eric Nagle.  Well, Eric, why don't you stop texting and play a little Boardroom Jimmy for the people,  all right?  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, it was, I guess, China had a little problem early on, and their market crashed. 
[00:33:00]  And then ours, for some reason, has to crash because theirs did.  They're like, oh, what?  China went down?  Well, then we got to...  That's a good sign.  Oh, oh, Boardroom Jimmy!  Well, thank God.  The bigger the plunge, the better it is for investors.  Really?  Yes.  The Asian market crashed because of the giant condom overload that nobody's using.  What?  I never knew. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  Buy sugars.  Sugars and cubic zirconia.  That's the way for this whole thing to turn around.  I specifically said, stop with those cow noises.  I don't know what they mean.  That's a bullish...  That's a bull.  You should know that.  That means you're feeling bullish.  You're bullish on the market.  Yes.  But where's the bear?  Because that's the bad one.  That we need to growl.  The market's dog-ish?  Well, it is.  Sell short, gentlemen!  Sell short!  Sell short!  Yeah, sell short!  Wait a minute.  How do you... 
[00:34:00]  Is that possible?  And you sell short in this market.  Is it good after a crash like this to sell short?  Well, there's going to be a penalty bid.  But if you sell short, things are sure to turn around sooner or later.  The Dow Jones...  Oh, it was up yesterday a little bit.  No, no, no.  Boredom Jimmy, it was way down.  Not compared with 1927, it wasn't.  It was up.  Oh, you're looking at the big picture, I see.  Yes, you have to look over a hundred year span.  Now, I've got to ask you, and this shows a little volatility here in the market. 
[00:34:30]  Where should we be looking today?  When that market opens, what do you suggest we do?  Get tangible fish assets, and then do what you're supposed to be doing with them, but  don't allow the crash to deter you from purchasing sugar.  Sugar?  Yes, sugar!  Sugar and tangible fish assets?  Sugar and no, fish oils.  Fish oils are the future.  Fish oils.  Okay.  You heard it here, people.  Sugar and fish oils are what you should be looking into buying. 
[00:35:00]  Yes, it was a stock market correction.  That was happening yesterday.  The stock market needed to be corrected, so it plunged a little bit in a three-minute  span, but that's a sign of healthy growth.  Healthy growth?  Healthy growth.  Sometimes you need to lose $600 billion to make $40.  I've specifically said that.  Now, boardroom Jimmy, the market's going to open.  Do you see a sustained gain throughout the day, or is this crash going to continue and 
[00:35:30]  bring us further into the hole by the time the market closes?  You raise an interesting point, and I think that I can agree with it.  No.  That wasn't a point.  It was a question.  Excellent point that there was something that happened yesterday, and yet it could go on  the rise a little bit later, but it all depends on what's happening overseas.  Now, knowing that, on the whole, the market will recover from this, should I be thinking  about maybe buying some options, some options, some call options, perhaps? 
[00:36:00]  Get a couple of puts.  I've told you many times when the market crashes that you should take all of your money and  put it into the market.  That's the best time to get in.  That's the definition of a put.  A put is when you put the money in the market.  Yes, put it down, and then walk away, and let it grow for you.  So how much do you think I should put in the market?  $75 to start.  You don't want to get too crazy.  I mean, kick back on Easy Street and enjoy a stogie. 
[00:36:30]  Industrial production is the future.  Industrial production.  Yes.  All right, okay.  That's good, tangible testimony you're giving here.  Of course it's good, tangible testimony.  Invest today.  The market's in good shape.  Well, not after yesterday.  Yesterday was a good day.  It fell a little bit, but that's to be expected on a Tuesday.  It was a record five-year loss.  I know, but I predicted that that would happen five years ago. 
[00:37:00]  It's on the front page of every paper in America, though.  This is good news for retirees.  It's good news for retirees.  How is that?  Because your money is jumping around actively.  But you want it to go up.  This is probably going to hurt a lot of people's accounts and portfolios.  No, your portfolio should be divested.  And what better way to have it divested than just to have it laying in ruins on the ground?  Are you saying it's best to just start over sometimes? 
[00:37:30]  Sometimes you have to just start right over.  You throw out the baby in the bathwater, and you start fresh.  You cash in a bond for $100, and you start small.  $100, and then maybe buy some sugar or fish oil.  Yes, get $100 to get yourself a hedge fund manager, and tell him, make my money work for me.  A hedge fund.  After O&A.  Live.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam Roberts.  That was the Opie and Anthony Show's residential stock expert, Boardroom Jimmy. 
[00:38:00]  Apparently he can't do the voice anymore.  He just did it so much that it was such a strain on his throat that he refuses to do it.  Ron Bennington, though, has entered the studio.  Speaking of experts, I mean an expert on all things, Ron Bennington.  Well, thank you very much.  So I had to come in here and throw out a member of my crew who was just, it looked like, lying back in Anthony's chair enjoying you guys working.  There was an awkward, maybe I should have just thrown the mics on for whatever reason.  Yeah, you should have.  Just to capture that, because Mark Zito was in here. 
[00:38:30]  He set up the studio, and then he kind of just sat back in the chair and put his feet up.  And, you know, Ron Bennington walks in to do a show, and he sees his producer, you know, feet on the desk.  Well, it would be a gigantic mistake to call him my producer.  Okay.  He is the serious, floating producer.  Yeah, and he really has taken that title to heart.  He does not, really, he is no more fixated to my show than he is any other show here. 
[00:39:00]  And he literally wears this generic, serious fucking cap wherever he goes.  He's just whoever needs help.  Yeah.  He's there to help him out, but not 100%.  Not 100%, and he's more like just to be with them.  Like, this is all great.  We all work in radio.  But nothing ever gets accomplished, and if he gets even, like, one or two things on the air,  on my show, like, one or two ideas from a production point of view, he's very self-satisfied.  Like, hey, that is done.  And doesn't realize Ronnie B is basically, you know, in here 20 hours a fucking week. 
[00:39:30]  Like, but the other really fucking fun thing about him is that he likes being here the  way you used to like hanging on the fucking corner with your friends.  Yeah, like, this is great.  This is his hangout, but.  Yeah.  We're all friends.  We're all doing great together.  He seems like, like, the way you describe him is kind of like, he likes to be there for  the after show.  Yeah, well.  Like, to hang out after and kind of just say, yeah, we all.  He likes to be in the halls.  He likes to see everybody. 
[00:40:00]  He likes to, you know, a little bit of gossip.  I'm OG here who's coming in.  Yeah.  But there's like zero chance that a produced piece of work will ever get on my show.  Right.  Just doesn't happen.  Well, E-Rock used to be like that, except he always did get stuff on the air, whether  it was at his expense or not.  You always had an E-Rock presence on the air.  He always brought something.  And then I will also say this about E-Rock.  When he has the piece of information for you, it's real.  Where, like, this fucking kid of mine, Zito will be coming by and he goes like this. 
[00:40:30]  You hear who's eating sandwiches, right?  And you're like, I don't give a fuck.  What difference does it make?  This isn't real stuff.  Hey, do you got a new pair of shoes?  That lady who works outside of, like, I don't even know who these people are.  Yeah, we're talking about their shoes now?  Yes, it's the smallest possible fucking bits of information.  I like to have real stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, you hear Wiki got busted with Coke.  Yeah.  Yeah, and now I know something.  But, yeah, he just...  Roland, could you take him under your wing? 
[00:41:00]  Roland likes him, I think.  I know.  Physically likes him.  No, probably.  That's the rumor.  No.  Maybe.  Roland, what's happening with you lately?  I turned on O&A and I'm not hearing any of the bang-up guests.  You were...  Couldn't even get Ira.  What happened with Ira today?  I think I let them rest.  I let the guys breathe.  I don't want to overload them with guests.  I thought the idea of a boardroom Ira would be the way to go, because you've got to have  some kind of fill-in. 
[00:41:30]  We do have, Roland said yesterday, Joe Rogan and Chuck Liddell on Friday.  And you are...  Are you working for stuff, like, throughout the week, too?  Yes.  There are people coming in the following week.  That's great.  You're booking people that O&A have had on for 10 years now.  You're booking their friends.  When are you getting Brother Joe to stop by?  Oh, boy.  What happened to the flashy names?  Now, your buddy...  They're coming in the next two weeks.  Michael Madsen ended up big in the news after he did the show. 
[00:42:00]  Same thing as Carl Lebeau.  How do you fall behind a half a million dollars on child support?  It happens.  A half a million.  I don't see how it could happen.  And then Ant said that he also, like, he went bankrupt and borrowed a million dollars  from Quentin Tarantino.  Yeah.  And that was it for that million bucks.  That was gone out the window.  Why don't Quentin just put him in a movie?  Yeah.  Don't pay him.  But to me, don't you think Madsen is, like, a serious fucking movie star?  Yeah.  Unlike the people that say they're movie stars?  I was like, to me, if I found out Michael Madsen was, like, downstairs at a fucking hot dog 
[00:42:30]  stand, I'd want to go by and take a look at him.  And I can't think of too many movie stars like that.  Well, it was funny, too, because when he came in here, Danny and me were having a conversation,  and Danny was like, you know, you go through his IMDB.  Why does this guy do so many projects?  Like, he just does, like, he does a lot of good movies, but then he'll also do all the  bullshit.  And then three days later, it comes out that he's 500 grand behind in child support.  It seems like if you got 600 bucks, you could get him to come over and play bongos at your 
[00:43:00]  house.  Well, Ron, I hope you're able to still do a show, even though what you walked in on wasn't  the most pleasant way to start.  I got to sit down with Rob Cross.  You are?  That's bad news.  Um, it just, Rob was helping me for a little while with it, but it's just, it's at a fucking  point now.  And today, he just fucking turned it.  Now, you said he looked dejected because of the way he liked, he laughed like he had  a broken arm after I go, what the fuck are you doing in here?  He, it started being like he acted like his arm was broken. 
[00:43:30]  Well, I don't think he's probably had to deal with a lot of people that really kind of lay  down the law the way you do.  You know what I mean?  I have a small staff and everybody has to work.  Right.  I get, I'm not, I'm not blaming you for it.  You're just trying to do a show here.  But I mean, you do the, like, you know, you know, you work with Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  He fucking trained under me.  When he shows up somewhere, he's ready to go to work.  Gangbusters.  I mean.  Hey, Dave came in and he wasn't sure what he wanted to do that day.  I'd never come in here on a Saturday without Dave saying, this is what I got today. 
[00:44:00]  I'm ready to go.  Exactly.  And it always works.  If like he would get a call from ONA, he would come in with something.  100%.  Oh God, I hope not.  Oh, please.  Why, why use that opportunity?  I want you guys to be fucking friends.  No.  Never.  And Roland said he wanted to show up at the Kong Off in Flemington where Eastside Dave  and me are going to be on Saturday.  Yeah.  Roland said he's going to show up.  But if you're going to be there, be supportive.  Okay, Roland?  Are you going to be there?  Yes.  Oh boy.  Well, Ron.  Somebody wants to talk to you, Roland, because there's missing tea from the back.  Anyway, none of that really matters right now. 
[00:44:30]  The thing is, we're all best friends.  We're all best friends.  It's the tea coffee.  Well, I don't know what any of that means.  That's all made up.  I don't know what it means.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
