<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in vulgar and sexually suggestive banter, setting the tone for "Whip Em Out Wednesday," a recurring segment involving a motorcycle ride to Philadelphia with women displaying their breasts.  They discussed a celebrity's refusal of a yarmulke before detailing the motorcycle ride's logistics, which involved a minor van issue.  Anthony described a disgusting encounter with an intern, while numerous callers reported sightings of "WOW" stickers promoting the show.  Keith the Cop, in studio, assisted with the ride's planning.  The hosts interacted with numerous callers, highlighting the large number of women waiting outside the studio, described in sexually suggestive terms.  A lengthy, bizarre conversation ensued with Andrew, a Wackbag.com fan with a speech impediment, whom the hosts repeatedly mocked.  Audio clips from interactions with the women outside were played throughout.

The show continued with updates on the "WOW" motorcycle ride, involving many motorcycles and "hot chicks" headed to Club Risqué in Philadelphia.  Studio guests included Colin Quinn, Keith Robinson, and Fat Bob Kelly, with mentions of Rich Voss, Chris Angel (scheduled later), and Scott Walterman (reporting from the delayed Space Shuttle launch).  Opie made absurd claims about inventing various things, Colin Quinn’s poker playing was discussed with comedic audio clips, and Andrew's awkwardness was repeatedly mocked.  The hosts also discussed the Space Shuttle delay.  A substantial portion featured audio submissions from various tribute bands, courtesy of Brother Joe, who was also in studio.  The segment concluded with updates on the slow-moving motorcycle ride.  The phrase "Whipple Mal Wednesday" was chanted repeatedly.

The next segment heavily featured music submissions from tribute bands: a No Doubt tribute band whose singer was compared to Gwen Stefani, and a Simon & Garfunkel tribute band from Argentina whose English was highlighted.  Discussion shifted to Long Island's music scene.  A phone call with Bob Kelly, recovering from a knee injury, dominated the segment.  A recording of Kelly's profane, homophobic outburst at a comedy club was played and discussed by the hosts and guests, including Colin Quinn and Steve Burns.  Brother Joe was also present.  The conversation also included a listener's planned media stunt, updates on the "WOW" motorcycle ride, and an interview with Scott Walterman about the Space Shuttle launch.

The show then opened with a discussion about street fairs and a train robbery, before transitioning to Criss Angel's upcoming in-studio appearance.  Bruce Kelly's emotional on-air outburst was met with teasing.  The hosts discussed "Whip Them Out Wednesday," a new TV edit segment, and a Philadelphia media prank, receiving updates from callers.  A significant portion revolved around the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of producer "Master Poe," with Clayton, the intern, unexpectedly acting as security.  The extended interview with Criss Angel covered his A&E show, "Mind Freak," his dangerous magic acts (helicopter hang, self-immolation, being buried alive), his disdain for David Blaine's style, and the ethics of magic.  Angel performed impromptu tricks.  The show concluded with updates on the motorcycle ride, focusing on Keith, Pat from Minaki, and Andrew, and further promotion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday" and Criss Angel's show.

Finally, the show ended with further discussion of the Philadelphia motorcycle trip, including crude jokes about seeing breasts.  Andrew's answering machine message ("biting a prostitute") was discussed, along with photos posted on openanthony.com featuring the trip and Chris Angel.  Angel’s A&E show was again promoted.  Keith called from Club Briss Gay in Philadelphia with a female companion, mentioning a planned breakfast. The hosts thanked Chris Angel and reiterated plans to post more photos and videos online.

[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  How about if he gives you the old chin chap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talker.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony show.  You better just sit back and watch.  You better just sit back and watch. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show.  Let's get the show.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hello, you areел behavior.  Hello, fuck face.  Hello, fuck face.  Genau.  Hello, fuck face.  Hello, fuck face.  Fuck face.  Stop calling me that.  I've seen a cop knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they were giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was. 
[00:05:00]  Okay, terrific.  That's an attention getter.  You got that right. 
[00:05:30]  And that's how we start today.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program on XM.  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  You're listening to the pioneers of satellite radio.  That's right, Robin.  Tell them, Fred.  I won't wear a yarmulke.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Something in the paper today.  The little celebrity gossip section.  Apparently he was out in the Hamptons watching a friend convert to Judaism.  And some guy walked up to him in the temple and offered him a yarmulke. 
[00:06:00]  And how he refused it.  It's going to ruin my hair, Robin.  Ruin his hair weave.  And his extensions and stuff.  Holy crap.  Look at all the hot women around here.  My God.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Why is all that stuff against the window so we can't see anything anymore?  Well, we're blocking that one.  Yeah.  There's always one that has to wreck the party. 
[00:06:30]  Jesus.  Go home.  Wreck the party.  Go home.  Please leave.  Don't you have homes.  Anyway, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday, everybody.  Yes, it is.  And today we're going to focus on Whip Em Out Wednesday, finally.  Very exciting day here at the station and soon on the highways and then in Philly.  Yeah.  We've got a lot of motorcycles out there.  Oh, my goodness.  Beautiful. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  Bravo.  Look at that.  Bravo.  We've got actual girls and they're actually in...  Jesus.  Wow.  Look at that ass.  They're in little...  What do you call that?  It's not a bikini.  Like boy shorts, kind of?  No, those are like hot pants.  Oh, hot pants.  Boys wear those.  Oh.  Hot pants, but...  No, those aren't.  Those are like...  They're smaller than usual, but they're the hot pants style.  They're smaller than like briefs.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:30]  Very small.  Whoa.  It says sports sexy on the back.  And then they got like some kind of bra top thing.  See, they should be wearing the juicy wear.  Juicy.  But it's always some fat pig that has to wear the juicy sweats.  Anthony, really fast because Patrick in Baltimore has breaking news.  Patrick, what's up?  Hey, how are you going to own it?  Sorry.  Oh, right.  Oh, geez.  Dude, hold it together.  Know it's early. 
[00:08:00]  I know you're a little flustered and stuff.  A lot of people listening, but just get it out.  Your wheel is wobbling.  Come on.  Yeah, you're wobbling.  Bring it back now, Patrick.  Your back wheel is wobbling.  Bring it back.  Hey, guys.  I've been a fan for about six months now.  I'm driving up to Baltimore right now, and I just passed your van on 95.  Oh.  Yes, I did get that email, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  That the van will be in Philly.  That's right.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The van goes to Philly.  That's for sure.  Is the WIC driving it personally to Philly? 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  I have no idea.  He was pissed off yesterday.  He certainly was.  That guy is a mover and a shaker and a go-getter.  When there's a problem and we are not happy with something, he will go to great lengths  to remedy the problem, and this is what he has done time and time again, and he did it  again with the van.  All of a sudden, we talked about not having the Opie and Anthony van for our appearance  because somebody else had it reserved, and we brought it up on the air yesterday, and  by the time I got home, I checked my email. 
[00:09:00]  There's the email.  The van will be in Philly tomorrow.  Don took care of it.  I have no idea what you said, Anthony, because you're so clogged up.  I am such a snot-ridden mess.  Who the fuck gets a cold in the middle of the summer?  Me!  Me!  I left my protective dome.  That's why you got a liver amongst the germs.  I left my dome, my protective dome over the weekend, and I think that's what did it.  Either that or it's you disgusting germ-ridden people that I work with on a day. 
[00:09:30]  It's good to live among germs.  I think one of the interns probably coughed on one of my forks or something, or knife.  Let's get it right.  He probably did that.  Probably went...  Wait, wait, wait, honey.  You can't move.  You can't move.  You're safe here.  You're in the germ-free zone now.  You understand?  Okay.  He probably grabbed the fork out of the drawer, and before he got into my view, went...  ...on the fork.  I know what happened.  He actually rubbed the corner of his mouth, and some of that white stuff came off the corner 
[00:10:00]  of his mouth.  I'm going to grab the tip of my fork.  That Petri dish.  Goop.  Eek.  All right, really fast.  Let's go to Louie in Yonkers.  Louie.  Yo.  What's going on, boys?  How are you, Louie?  Is anyone going to be riding Ben's Hog down to Philly?  Ah, yeah.  A couple of hogs out there.  Ben's Hog.  Seat's 10.  Seat's 10.  I love that exaggerated humor.  Anyway, so we have a bunch of hot girls outside the studio already. 
[00:10:30]  Wow.  And it's Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday today, Anthony.  A very simple concept.  Do you want to explain...  Oh, it's so easy.  You just put a wow on your vehicle, and the girls know what it's all about.  They'll see it and flip out their titties for you.  Yep, it's been working like a charm for many, many years.  Many years.  I think we're on our 50th year of wow, Opie.  Jesus.  Jesus, no way.  No fucking way.  Yes, I remember the first one in Times Square after VE Day.  And if you want a wow sticker, you just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City. 
[00:11:00]  The address is 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  And a zip code, I don't know.  Zip code?  I don't know.  I don't know what the zip code is.  Just go to opianthony.com for the actual address.  Yeah.  The accurate address.  Let's go to Colorado.  Colorado, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey, earlier this morning at a truck stop, I passed these four tour buses.  Supposedly the lead bus is M&M's, which is kind of ironic, considering the fact they, all buses, had wow stickers on the back. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah?  That would be cool as hell if that's true.  Oh, that's what they told me.  I mean, the guys that were getting on her all had shirts that said crew on them.  And when I sent them to the security guard inside the truck stop, he said, yeah, it was there at M&M's tour.  So, I don't know if he's 100% true, but I saw a wow sticker on the back of at least two of the buses.  Well, you've got to think, if you're a band and you're touring all over the country, why wouldn't you have, you know, wow stickers on your tour buses?  Yeah, but I thought M&M had a show on the Little Doggy Company. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, stop.  He's a name.  They bought his name so they could put it on its channel.  Hey, Anthony, I think your problem is allergies, not a cold.  No, it's a cold.  I don't have allergies.  It just popped up a couple of days ago.  I had that thing where it feels like you have a big lump of snot in the back of your throat that you can't get down, you can't swallow.  And then all of a sudden, thank you, Jimmy, you're grimacing at that whole, yeah, as he's eating his eggs. 
[00:12:30]  He got you.  That never happened.  What a delicious morning treat for you, Anthony.  Yes, and then I just clogged up and, wow, where do these girls come from?  There's a bunch of these sports sexy girls just peering around here.  Well, there's that one in the glasses out there.  Which one?  Oh, Stalker Patty?  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, so here's the deal.  Yes, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday today, and we're finally going to, you know, promote the hell out of wow. 
[00:13:00]  And highlight it today.  And Keith the Cop's in studio.  Keith, I think, pretty much came up with the idea originally, right?  Not the wow, but the motorcycle ride?  Yeah, the one we did back in the day.  We did the wow summit when we first got syndicated down in Philly.  Summit.  Well, it was a summit.  It was a summit.  We were bringing cities together.  Because what happened was we were a huge New York radio show.  Absolutely huge.  And wow was just massive in the New York area.  And then we finally started getting syndicated, and Philly's like a second home to us. 
[00:13:30]  And I think Philly was the first market we syndicated to.  So we wanted to bring some of the wow to them.  Some of the happiness that is wow to them.  Yeah.  So we came up with this wow motorcycle ride.  Keith the Cop took it upon himself to organize the whole thing.  Went down to Philly with a bunch of guys and girls on the back of bikes, flashing the whole way.  And we had a great, great time.  Knowing we could win their hearts and minds with tests.  It was just a present that we gave to Philly.  And we're redoing it today, Anthony.  And who knows where this is going to go. 
[00:14:00]  I think we should organize some more motorcycle rides.  Nationwide.  Maybe some convoys.  All over the whole country.  That would be great.  But this is the start.  We're going to do a wow motorcycle ride today.  We have at least, what, 50 or 60 guys outside already?  Yeah, about 50, 60.  A couple more pulled up just now.  50 or 60 bikes outside.  Obviously some very, very hot and lovely ladies outside the studio.  Juicy.  Very juicy.  They're juicy.  They're barely wearing anything, which is definitely going to be a plus. 
[00:14:30]  That's what you want.  Of course.  Absolutely.  And Master Poe is having everyone fill out paperwork.  Oh, good.  That'll take until 10 o'clock tonight, and then they'll be off.  I got going, Keith, it's smooth.  Oh, absolutely.  What wouldn't be smooth about filling out paperwork?  People should have heard Keith before the mics went on.  Oh, my God.  He was losing his mind.  I'm a team player.  Everything went just fine.  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[00:15:00]  Fucking asshole.  I wish we had the audio of you just before the show started.  Classic.  Anyway, if you're on the New Jersey Turnpike today, and you're listening to this show,  and you don't have a wow on the back of your car, or your truck, or whatever you're riding,  you're just fucking insane.  Yeah, it's going to be.  It's going to be about tits galore.  Scratch it into the paint with your keys.  Do whatever you've got to do so that you get to see.  Do some of that, what is it called, the ghetto kids?  Scratchity.  Scratchity.  Right on the back.  With graffiti.  Now they scratch it into plexiglass and stuff. 
[00:15:30]  Scratchity.  Scratchity.  Scratchity.  Do it right into the back of your back windshield there, or whatever.  Want to stop bringing some of these girls in?  Of course.  Get on the road.  Say hi.  Are they going to flash, though, or are they going to be like, eh, I don't know.  Well, they're not strippers.  I don't know.  Are they?  I don't know.  Patty's going to flash.  Oh, that's always a trick.  Is Patty going on this thing?  Absolutely.  Who's she riding with?  I think she might be riding with me.  Oh.  Well, you're really lucked out.  She painted like James Byrd and just dragged her. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, God.  All right, grease man.  Jesus.  Is she going to be on the back of your bike?  Yes, I believe she is.  That's wonderful.  Great.  Lucky you.  Wow, you're...  All these hot chicks out there, and you've got a 50-year-old virgin on the back of your  bike.  Did your wife allow you to take your dick with you today?  I think it's very nice that I take Patty with me on the back of my bike today. 
[00:16:30]  It's very nice.  I like the way it vibrates between my legs.  This is wonderful.  Fantastic.  She's going to reach around and tell her there's a handle around front.  She's going to reach around and latch on.  Are you excited to have Patty on the back of your bike there, Keith?  As excited as I was about the paperwork.  You do realize there's a bunch of 10s right outside the studio.  I do.  Okay.  I do. 
[00:17:00]  And you've got a 2 on the back of your bike.  A 2?  And I'm being kind.  Giving her a big increase there.  What is Patty, you think?  A 2, Jim?  Not even a 2.  It's not even a number rating.  You don't rate anyone.  I'd give her a 2 because she's not off.  Her body is okay.  What?  Her body, I mean, for 50.  She's not.  For 50.  Absolutely.  That's not saying much.  There's an asterisk, of course, but yeah, she's not bad.  Her body's not bad for 50.  For 50.  Yeah.  For 20, she should be executed. 
[00:17:30]  But for 50, you know, she's.  All right.  Before the show, Danny went downstairs to talk to some of these freaks.  There's a lot of people outside the studio right now.  Yep.  And we've got some audio.  Let's go to the first track here.  You going on the ride today?  Actually, I just came down here to take some photos of everybody and to post on whackbag.com.  How come you're not going on the ride?  I didn't plan it.  I'll go down. 
[00:18:00]  It's not too late.  Tag along.  I don't know who I could, you know, tag along.  It was not, but I'm just hanging out.  All right, listen.  Wait a minute.  Go get that guy immediately.  What is that?  Who the fuck?  Danny, get in here.  I thought it was Ozzy, first of all.  I thought it was somebody just making, you know, making a gag and doing an Ozzy impression.  We really got to tighten up that thing.  That thing's been falling for weeks.  Who is that guy?  Danny, that's one of the fans downstairs. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  He's excited to be here.  Very excited to speak to me, apparently.  Well, can you go get him?  Absolutely.  Go get him immediately.  We just found a new character.  Yeah.  You know how hard it is to find new characters for this program?  Oh.  Let's see this guy again.  I thought...  Look, this came out of nowhere.  What's wrong?  Problem, uh...  What's wrong?  No, everything's fine.  No, say what...  Everything's fine.  More fucking paperwork?  Where's the girl?  Where are all the girls in here?  Yeah, why are there girls in here?  They came here.  Why are the girls not in here? 
[00:19:00]  Right over there.  What are they doing?  Paperwork.  You know, you've got to write everything down that happens today so we can talk to Don about this.  Anyway...  I mean, I sent everything out last week.  All right, here we go.  Let's stay on track, though.  We'll get the girls in here in a few minutes.  All right.  Listen to this guy again.  This is the real deal.  I thought this was a guy just imitating Ozzy or something, Anthony.  You going on the ride today?  Actually, I just came down here to take some photos of everybody and to post on whackbag.com. 
[00:19:30]  How come you're not going on the ride?  I didn't plan it.  Hold on.  It's not too late.  Tag along.  I don't know who I could, you know, tag along.  It was not, but I'm just hanging out.  Tag along.  That is fantastic.  This guy cannot be real. 
[00:20:00]  What a creepy sound.  What a rousing endorsement for whackbag.  He's one of the mods.  You can just picture him over on a freshly killed body doing that.  That's the type of thing.  You walk in, you see blood in the crib, and he's standing there with a hammer, just making  Herman Munster hands.  But it was making sounds.  I had to make it quiet.  This is going to be my new favorite thing to do around the house, Ed. 
[00:20:30]  Herman Munster hands.  He has little fingers, like, flipping around.  The baby, I was just watching.  It made a noise, and I had to make it quiet.  What a creep.  What a complete scary creep.  But who's not going to ever take this guy for the rest of the day?  All day now.  I'm going to go to Starbucks.  I'll have a grande. 
[00:21:00]  Wait, keep me outside for a second, because I want to get through these last three clips.  More audio from downstairs, Anthony.  We're getting ready for the WOW bike ride, motorcycle ride to Philly.  A lot of people want to know if you're going to be stopping at any of the rest areas to pick up more people.  Yeah, absolutely.  We're going to be on the turnpike, so we'll be making a couple stops.  New Jersey turnpike pretty much all the way to Philly.  More lorry holes.  I have no idea what stops.  I mean, you'll just see the people coming.  This is going to be at least 60 to 70 bikes starting out with this thing. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  And what are you guys going to be doing for us today?  Nothing.  What?  What did she say?  Nothing?  Oh, it says here, girl outside says she'll do nothing.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's what she said.  That's what she said.  You know what?  I read this thinking she'll do anything.  Yeah.  Stupid me.  All right, so she'll do nothing.  So what's in the bag, man?  Soda, maybe?  I don't look like soda.  Yeah, it's not really soda.  What is it?  Beer.  You're drinking at a quarter to seven in the morning. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  Yes, I am.  And are you taking a ride down to Philly?  You better believe it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Are you kidding me?  This is going to be a fun, fun day.  I hope he's riding with somebody.  I hope there's a sidecar on one of those bikes for that guy.  I'm just urinating very, very, very much and fueling up, and hopefully I don't pee my pants on the way down there.  All right, a guy hoping he doesn't piss himself.  Gaming high. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, but I'm going to have to hit him if he goes down.  This is one of the guys going on the ride.  Hold on.  Jim, go ahead.  Jim.  All right, we lost him.  Getting in a fight.  All right.  Let's see.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, man.  I want to make sure you guys stay in the truck lanes going down to Philly.  Where are your biggest fans?  Oh, yeah?  Will you be in the truck lane?  Because it splits there, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  They'll figure it out, bro.  But the express with the... 
[00:23:00]  Hey, if you guys...  If you're a trucker and you're going to be between New York and Philly and you see this mess go by,  make sure you give them a little toot-toot, a little support, okay?  Dirty girls.  They're dirty girls and they have to die like Mother said.  All right, can we get this guy in here?  Where is that guy?  Give off the fat of the land.  I'm going to bow to this guy.  Wow, more very hot girls.  Holy mackerel.  Get up the house.  Wow.  Sport sexy.  What is the sport sexy about? 
[00:23:30]  Lovely.  Someone who knows how to market their company.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  They put their friggin' logo on hot chicks' asses.  That's wonderful.  Hey, here he is.  How you doing?  What's up, bro?  Step up to the mic.  Hey, do you want to sit down or stand?  Actually, it doesn't make a difference, really.  No?  No.  Can you just stand?  Okay.  And what's your name, sir?  What's...  My name is Andrew.  Andrew? 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  And a fan of the show?  Yes, a big fan of the show.  Big fan of the show?  And you, I guess you're from the Wackbag.com message board?  Yes, I am.  Wonka614.  Oh, yeah!  Wonka614.  Absolutely.  I've seen your name up there a few times.  And will you come down here just to support the ride?  I take pictures and say hi to everybody. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I met your brother a couple times and taken pictures of him.  Joel!  And his band, yes.  Absolutely.  What do you think of the crowd we've got here today?  Very nice.  Yeah, you see some of the beautiful young ladies?  They're beautiful.  Yes, they are.  Very nice.  Quite beautiful.  What would be more beautiful than taking one and slicing their throat?  I think that's Jimmy's department. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, wow.  I think you could use some help.  Well, that's great.  What do you do for a living?  I drive a private cab in the Bronx.  A private cab in the Bronx?  In the Bronx?  Jesus.  Wow.  How are you still alive?  You are...  Jesus, you laugh at that shuttle crew.  Pretty much.  That is a dangerous gig.  You ever been robbed? 
[00:25:30]  Well, thank God I haven't, no.  No, huh?  I haven't.  I haven't been robbed.  I've got to ask, what the hell is that thing you do?  Is that sort of a stutter?  Yes.  Actually, it's a speech impediment.  Speech impediment?  We love speech impediments, though.  We all have one in the studio.  I don't know you guys who goof on it, but...  No, no, I just wanted a little time, and...  I just wanted to lay it out there on the table.  What's your name? 
[00:26:00]  Andrew.  Oh, he said Andrew.  He said that already.  You don't listen to the people, Opie.  You don't pay attention, Opie.  I'm sorry.  You don't pay attention.  I just want to give him a new name.  What?  Stuttering Andrew.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  Well, and you drive a private cab up there in the Bronx.  Yes, I do.  And a lot of, I guess you take a lot of black people around.  We have a lot of golfers, yes.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:26:30]  A lot of golfers.  Yes.  And these are the people that normal, I guess normal, cabs wouldn't pick up.  You're always hearing about cabs that don't pick up.  But you take anyone, anytime, anywhere.  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah?  I mean, most of the calls are off the phones.  Oh, right.  So they call up and ask you, and you come pick them up.  Of course.  And drive.  And have some of these people, like, shown up and, you know, give me your money kind of thing? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, but I hope not.  Yeah.  Wow.  Can I just raise the feedback?  Of course you can, Opie.  We just switched the show opener, but you know the show opener where I talk about how  we're going to do this until we're number one with Down syndrome children?  Well, George the Geek, somewhere in Jersey, writes, ding, ding, ding, we are now number  one with Down syndrome children.  Oh, he doesn't have Down syndrome.  That is a hell of an impediment you got there, though.  Sometimes you just lock up, huh? 
[00:27:30]  Sometimes I get nervous and I lock up.  Nervous, yeah, you lock up.  Like right now.  Right now you're a little nervous.  And you lock up.  A little bit.  You know we're going to exploit this speech impediment, right?  Okay.  Like he should do the news today.  Oh, no shit.  You got anywhere to be or can you hang out for a little while?  I'm off today.  You're off, huh?  Actually, I called and I was sick today. 
[00:28:00]  Boom!  No, I didn't want you to relax today.  I'm going to keep your edge over there.  Don't let this guy relax.  Well, you're a fascinating man, Andrew.  Well, is there any girls that want to flash?  That could be very interesting with Andrew in the studio.  It could be a little nerve-wracking, sure.  Yeah.  Can we find out?  Bring in one or two of the hotties out there.  Well, I think the girls from, um, what was the name of the company again?  What?  Sports Sexy.  That's from a bikini bar, I guess? 
[00:28:30]  They're from a bikini bar in Jersey or something like that?  Yeah.  Very nice.  An Opie and Anthony panties.  We got Opie and Anthony panties?  Jesus.  Who knew those were, uh...  Hey, I'm not complaining, but if you want to market the show, you got to have something  that other people could see, besides one at a time.  You are breathing a little heavy, aren't you?  Yeah.  A little bit.  And Mike, that really, uh, really comes across on the air.  I like it. 
[00:29:00]  Sounds like the elephant man running uphill.  All right, Andrew.  I like it.  Uh, let's say hi to Taz.  Taz, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Uh, I want an elf by the sky.  He's walked his stapler.  Hi, Stephener.  Stephener.  Very good.  If you call the show, you got to turn down the radio a little bit.  The Gooch in Cleveland, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  Hey, I got a, uh, a wow on the way into work today.  Okay.  Going into 90 on Cleveland. 
[00:29:30]  The chick, uh, lifted up her shirt on her tits.  It was written, Lil Jimmy Norton Live, July 23rd.  Ah, you suck!  Tickets available at Ticketmaster and EatABullet.com.  Thank you, mister.  Ah, get out of here.  Andy, what's up?  Andy, let's go.  Hey, what's up, Bobby and Anthony?  This is Andy.  Listen, um, SportsCity is a cool bar, man.  It has, um, plasma TVs and the chicks are practically naked.  Yeah, they're barely wearing anything right now, so.  Yeah, man.  Practically.  Cool.  Great job, man.  All right, we're going to get some of those girls in. 
[00:30:00]  Listen, real quick, are you saying something?  Yeah.  It's away from my wild stickers, man, for almost a year.  A year?  Did you send in a self-addressed stamped envelope?  Yeah.  All right, send in another one and we'll, uh, make sure we get it out to you.  It might have been just a...  Hey, thanks, guys.  Hey, big fan over here, man.  Let me just say hi to my brother, Larry.  You just did.  Thanks, bro.  No, thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to John the Trucker.  John?  Yo, shit dicks.  What's up, John?  Hey, gentlemen.  I just came down to South Park.  I'm on my way to Philly and, uh, brand new Newark Airport down from Newark down to Elizabeth 
[00:30:30]  there.  There's a bunch of unmarked, uh, cops hanging around down there.  All right.  They got a bunch of four-wheelers all over and stuff.  Jesus, what is Colin doing here?  Colin just poked his head in to say he's at Caroline's weekend.  What is he doing awake?  All right, John.  So, John wants to tell us that there's a lot of cops on the turnpike.  We're going to be safe today.  Oh, boy.  Colin.  How you doing, baby?  Colin, get over here because you got to hear this guy.  I like this guy.  That's Andrew.  All right.  This is Andrew, our new character.  Oh, this guy? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  We just found him today.  I was down to this, hanging out for 20 minutes.  You are?  With the bikers?  Yeah.  He's going to be a big star, this guy, Andrew.  Andrew drives, drives, he drives a private, I guess, cab service in the Bronx.  Yes.  I understand that, uh, Berkowitz took the hit for a couple of your boys, too.  Which is a very, uh, I think a very dangerous job for you.  For the passengers.  Now that we have a big star in the studio, it's really going to freak out Andrew.  What do you think, Andrew? 
[00:31:30]  Why don't you stalk me and kill me, to put me out of my misery?  Oh, oh, oh, that would be too easy.  Kill me.  Big fan of Colin?  Yeah, I like him.  Very funny.  And you watch, uh, did you watch Tough Crowd?  Yes, I did.  Yeah, you watched Tough Crowd.  I'll give you, and I'm not kidding right now, I swear to you, I'll give you $10,000 over the  course of a couple of incremental payments if you kill Norton.  It doesn't have to be you on the air. 
[00:32:00]  Just in your own time.  If Norton turns up strangled in a month, I'm going to send you $10,000.  And if it's Voss, $8,000.  And bring me Voss's teeth as proof that you killed him.  I left her on my altar.  I was murdered on my altar.  I'm a martyr.  Should we bring this guy to Philly?  Is there anyone out there that could get him to Philly?  Everybody's listening to him out there.  They love him already.  Yeah.  Really? 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  He could be the official spokesperson for this damn thing.  Yup, for going to Philly?  Yeah.  Andrew and, uh, somehow we could, do you have a cell phone where you could call in the show?  Yeah, I have a cell phone.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you don't remove the mic from that guy.  Ever.  Ever.  Don't get too close to him.  You ever see, uh, yeah, something about Mary?  He grabs the, hey.  By the way, one of the bikers down there has a little, uh, half-ostridge-shell cup for Norton to ride along in.  As a hatchling.  As a hatchling. 
[00:33:00]  That's great.  It's got to be a half.  You can't put him in the whole one because he's already lost his egg tooth that he chipped.  He chipped out of the egg.  He's just like this the whole trip.  He would just be stranded.  At the truck stops, he could regurgitate food into his mouth to feed him.  All right, we're going to have to get Andrew to go to Philly because, uh, we need to talk to you all day.  You have a cell phone, though, right?  Yes, I have a cell phone.  You must have a plan with a lot of minutes because I think any conversation probably takes you a long time. 
[00:33:30]  All you've got to do is remember one thing for the rest of your life.  Yes.  The scratches on my hands are from my cat, officer.  Hey, is Pat from Menachie downstairs?  Could Andrew ride with Pat?  That would be a great team.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  And then we'll have Pat and Andrew check in from the ride, and then we'll have Keith the cop checking in.  It's going to be a great day.  It's the WOW motorcycle ride.  Better have some pallets of cinder blocks in the back of the van so it doesn't just flip over forward with these two in there. 
[00:34:00]  Kind of hefty, aren't you?  What do you eat poorly?  Actually, I'm on a diet to lose weight right now, actually.  You are?  Yes, I am.  How's that working out for you?  Not bad.  Not bad?  How long have you been on it?  About three weeks.  Three weeks, and have you lost any weight?  Over 10 pounds.  Over 10 pounds.  Not bad.  Congratulations.  Do you have a gal?  No, I don't. 
[00:34:30]  No?  Besides, you know, under a pile of lime in your basement?  Not enough trunk space.  You grew up in the Bronx?  You grew up in the Bronx, didn't you?  Yes.  I knew it.  Yes.  Really?  That must have been a tough upbringing, huh?  You get beat up by the black people?  No?  You grew up in the Italian part.  Oh, yeah?  In the Italian part?  Is that what you were?  Oh, close.  Wow.  Wow.  We have a lot of calls coming in.  Let's go to John in Ohio.  John?  Yeah.  Hey. 
[00:35:00]  Go ahead, John.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, they've got to take Andrew down to Philly with them so he can hold the bikes up when  they use his retard strength to change the tires.  Obviously, the guy is of sound mind.  Obviously.  Just has a speech impediment.  People sometimes think maybe you're mentally incapacitated a little bit because of your speech  impediment?  Sometimes.  Sometimes, yeah.  If that guy from Ohio could have seen Andrew's eyes when he said retard strength, he would have  took it back, even in Ohio. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  His eyes just went like, all right.  Yeah.  Daddy beat me senseless.  That's why I'm shy, but I swear to God, nobody touches me again.  I will kill this guy.  I'm going to kill him.  All right.  We should get some more of these people in here before we start to ride.  Bring a couple of the girls in, then.  Keep Andrew right where he is.  Yeah.  Man.  Danny, I bow to you today.  I want to see which ones Eric picks.  By the way, Anthony, we've got to acknowledge Danny today.  Danny found Andrew.  Danny.  Danny took it upon himself to go down there and record some of these people.  He's a star.  He's right. 
[00:36:00]  You can tell.  See, Colin, this is what it's all about, right?  Holy Mary.  Well, Corinne called me up and told me that this was going to happen.  Oh, my God.  Hey, ladies.  Hi.  This is Andrew.  Hi, hello.  Andrew, say it.  What do you think, Andrew?  Very nice.  I would have said it the same way, so I don't feel strange.  Imagine what you could do with them with a bow saw and some duct tape, right?  Girls, be careful to dress like that.  Your breasts might come out on the drive down. 
[00:36:30]  Be careful.  You could get a violation.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow, these are lovely young ladies, aren't they?  And you're all dancers?  No.  Do you dance at all?  No, it's like a bikini bar, right?  It's a bikini bar.  You just kind of strut around in your bikinis.  Is it an all-ages bar?  They look 14.  How old are you ladies?  Is there anything wrong with that?  How old are you all?  21.  21.  21, 18, 22, 21.  And 39.  That's great.  I heard 39.  Who said that? 
[00:37:00]  Very nice.  And you guys are going to go to Philly with us today?  Yes.  Awesome.  We're going to have a good time.  There's going to be a big party going on.  They're wearing something in your honor.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You guys want to show them your special, special, special panties?  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at that.  Show them what it says in the back.  They got open wow on the back.  It's wow on the back.  Are we handing out the panties today?  It's just a bevy of very nice asses.  I'm not complaining.  It's just turned around.  What a great promotional item for the show. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone's got to wow Andrew.  Huh?  Someone has to wow Andrew.  Yeah.  And it's Whip Mal Wednesday.  Someone's got to wow Andrew.  Is there any girls that are willing to wow Andrew?  You will?  Corrine doesn't play games.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, Corrine will do it.  Donkey sauce.  Hold on.  You've got to get them on mic, though.  That's the whole gag.  What do you think there, Andrew?  Yeah, I've got to shut the curtain.  Oh, baby, nice.  Oh, Jesus.  Beautiful.  Wow.  You are about the creepiest son of a bitch I've ever, ever come across. 
[00:38:00]  That right hand is twitching.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  How long does it take to choke one of these bitches out?  You've got to know down to the second.  You ever seen a stepfather?  Yeah.  It sounds like you had a strict upbringing.  Are we here to talk about me or buy a house?  Hey, you girls are friendly, holding hands.  That's cute.  That's very cute. 
[00:38:30]  There's a bunch of them holding hands.  You're just kind of supporting each other?  Is that it?  Yeah.  She's my girlfriend.  She's your girlfriend?  She's my girlfriend.  You don't have to say no, you're just kidding.  Just leave it at that.  Just let that one lie there.  Well, girls love to do the fake lesbian stuff now.  Yeah.  They kind of make believe a little bit, right?  Yeah.  It's a little forced, but sometimes it probably leads to real stuff.  Okay.  I bet lesbians love it.  Yeah.  Real ones because they're like, oh.  What celebrity does everyone tell you you look like?  You.  Me?  Yeah.  I get Jennifer Love Hewitt. 
[00:39:00]  I see it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What about Eva Longiorio from that other show, The Walking Desperate?  Wow.  Very, very nice.  And look, Andrew's just chomping at the bit.  Andrew, are you sporting?  Not yet, but almost.  I got to ask you, you mind a couple of, not ridiculous personal questions, but maybe a 
[00:39:30]  little personal question.  When was the last time you hooked up?  And by that, I don't mean a block and tackle and a hook in your basement.  I mean, like got a woman.  Had the pleasure of a woman.  About a year ago.  A year ago?  Yeah.  Did you pay for it?  No.  No?  But she did.  Sleeping under a pile of leaves somewhere.  She was at three in the morning.  She was leaving some club in Yonkers.  I said, he's Chester Avenue.  Where are we going? 
[00:40:00]  Her new address, Shallow Grave, right?  Co-op city.  Yeah, like a year ago?  Give us the details.  How did that happen?  Was it a bar?  Was it a fair?  Actually, it was a customer, actually.  A customer?  I like this story already.  Picked her up in the cab?  You start, what, chit-chatting a little bit?  Late night?  Actually, I had you guys on, actually.  Oh, really? 
[00:40:30]  It was just, I'm talking and chatting.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're talking.  She asked me what time I got off.  Uh-huh.  And I hooked up with her after I got off.  Oh.  Went to her house.  That's nice.  Went to her place?  Yeah.  And, what, maybe a little drink?  You partake in a little of the drink?  Yeah, occasionally, yes.  A little bit?  Yes.  And then, uh, and what did this girl look like? 
[00:41:00]  Yik.  Yik?  All right.  That's gratitude.  Yik.  Yik.  Well, you won't find any yiks today on the way down to Philly, that's for sure.  If you could take that as a compliment, girls.  What an awful compliment.  No yiks here.  Maybe we should set, uh, Andrew up with Stalker Patty.  Well, you ever met Patty? 
[00:41:30]  Actually, I've taken some pictures of her.  Yeah?  And talking with her.  Yeah.  Before.  Patty, have you met Andrew?  Yeah, outside on the street, coming over.  Yeah, coming over.  What do you think of him?  They're all very nice.  They're all very nice?  Yeah, he's very nice.  All the guys are very nice.  All his personality.  Everybody's nice.  Would you maybe, uh, if, you know, and we'd be willing to foot the bill here, would you  go out on a date with Andrew? 
[00:42:00]  I think both of you could use maybe a little company.  Of course I would.  All right.  Maybe we could set that up.  Sure, I'd go out on a date.  A little, uh, night out on the town here in Manhattan.  You go to dinner.  Maybe a little dancing or something.  You dance at all, uh, Patty?  Um, just by myself at home when I'm exercising.  I do my aerobics.  Oh, Christ.  You don't.  These two are perfect for each other.  What music you listen to?  Let's get physical.  Physical.  A lot of dance tunes from the 60s, mostly, by the, um, Four Seasons or creams or something 
[00:42:30]  like that.  Yeah.  Stomp every aluminum club.  And then some of the disco things, you know, like electric slides.  Here she's a maniac, maniac on the floor.  And she's dancing like she never danced before.  With her leg warmers.  Oh, a lot better than that when I sing.  She could use, like, those wrist, those wrist warmers for leg warmers. 
[00:43:00]  What are they called?  I stink.  Trying to reenact that scene from Flashdance with the water.  Oh, no.  No.  She lays back in the chair, pulls a little rope, and a bucket full of water hits her.  Should be blood, and she should be in a prom dress on a stage.  Patty, I stopped by your work yesterday.  I know you did.  Oh, good job.  I was off.  I know.  I stopped by your diver to see Patty.  Colin, got some chocolate?  No, I stopped by to see Patty.  Oh, you really did? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  What a good guy.  A couple people have been by, you know, when I've been there.  Opie came.  You come a lot of times.  Oh.  He's not saying that.  You mean you may have to keep it out.  Well, not a lot of times, but you come every once in a while.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, I only saw Opie there once.  And that's the only time to see me there.  That was a major coincidence.  Brad in Dallas, what's up?  Yeah, I was wondering if this cat, Andrew, would mind saying, some people call it a Kaiserblade.  I call it a Sting.  You guys have a good day, man. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  And, Andrew, would you mind going out with Patty, maybe, for a night out?  Okay.  Okay?  Okay, I would.  Yeah?  Be honest, though.  Is she your type?  We like honesty on the show.  What do you think of Patty?  You know, with the awful pulse and breathing.  Your type?  Somehow, I don't think this is his impediment coming in.  I think he's just not speaking.  Well, you have a relative comparison to make with the rest of the room.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, it's a tough morning for her to be. 
[00:44:30]  Out of these girls right here, there's such a variety of beauty in the studio.  Which is the most your type?  Don't be shy.  Just point one out that is the most your type of girl.  You have blondes, brunettes, tall.  They're all looking away.  They're all looking away.  Usually, you do that, and the girls will look at the guy.  They're walking, hoping.  I don't know.  In this case, they're all turning around looking at the wall.  Andrew, you have to know right away.  It's a thing guys know.  They can look at a group of girls, and you know which type, which one you find your type. 
[00:45:00]  He knows.  He's just trying to not find himself with the rest of them.  Which one?  Over there.  What's your name, Missy?  One.  Zach.  Victim number one.  Step up to the mic.  You're the lucky one he chose.  What's your name?  Christina.  Christina.  And how tall a gal are you?  Five, eight and a half.  You're five, eight and a half.  Blonde hair.  Very attractive girl.  Thank you.  Very beautiful.  And you are Andrew's type. 
[00:45:30]  Great.  Would you object to being in a well with a poodle?  It puts the fucking lotion in.  Oh, you mean the blonde girl?  Christina?  Yes.  I know who she was.  She's still in here.  Well, what do you think of Andrew?  He's a nice guy. 
[00:46:00]  A nice guy, right?  Seemed nice enough.  Kind of a loner.  Never really talked to the neighbors much.  And then the horrific fine.  Occasionally brought out lumpy shopping bags.  Yeah, you just, I fast forward maybe a few months down the road, just seeing cops pulling  out boxes and boxes out of his apartment with tape over them.  That yellow tape.  Do not fuck with this box tape.  What's your weird female driver's licenses in a box?  That's some jewelry. 
[00:46:30]  They call those trophies.  Yeah, so he found you, well, would you ever go out with a guy like Andrew?  Just based on, I know he's a nice guy, and if you sat down and talked to him, you'd probably  shoot yourself.  But if you got to know him a little bit, maybe things would be different.  But just on first impression, would you go out with a...  Probably not.  Probably not?  No.  What's your type?  Not him. 
[00:47:00]  This is brutal.  Sorry.  Andrew, you have to know, you have to know that whatever, you know, you're dealt a hand  in life, and you got to play it.  And obviously...  Andrew, basically, I was trying to tell you you got to aim a lot lower.  Yeah, you got to aim lower.  If he really kept working out and going to keep on a diet, and then you shaved your head  and grew, like, the goatee, maybe some earrings, a little egg...  Yeah, you might be able to hook yourself up a little better.  You're not working.  All right, we got to get everyone out of here, because people are getting nervous.  Oh, really? 
[00:47:30]  Especially that guy that we're not allowed to talk about.  How you doing, man?  Hey, keep the cop.  Come on up to the mic and tell us what's going to happen here, all right?  Give us the whole deal again, in case we got new listeners tuning in here.  Absolutely.  We're going to be leaving the studio.  We're going to be heading down the New Jersey Turnpike, or Garden State Turnpike.  Whatever the fuck it is.  New Jersey Turnpike.  Jersey Turnpike.  It's that turnpike.  That one that runs New Jersey.  In Jersey.  What's it called?  Yeah, the New Jersey Turnpike, heading down to Club Risque, which is located at 1700 South 
[00:48:00]  Columbus Boulevard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  So, like I said, make sure you got your wow on your car.  We're etching in the paint.  Do what you got to do.  We got a lot of lovely ladies here.  I'll say.  Just want to thank two people.  Sports Sexy.  Come on.  Sports Sexy.  Thanks them for coming down.  Girls rock.  Also, we have a large group of riders from Nick David.  Nick David brought down a whole bunch of his guys.  Try it.  Get a plug in, bro.  Appreciate it.  Ooh.  How you guys doing?  What's up, mister?  Yeah.  My name is Nick David, and I represent TriStateSportBikes.com. 
[00:48:30]  It's an online community for the entire Tri-State area.  It's about 2,500 motorcycle riders on there right now.  Looking to get into the tens of thousands.  Hopefully, with you guys' help.  Appreciate it.  Awesome.  Sure.  Check it out.  So, we're going to have some fun today and see some titties or something.  Hell yeah.  Of course we are.  Fucking A.  That's what this is all about.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Fuck yeah.  All the way down to Philly.  All right.  Good.  Good job.  Thanks a lot, guys.  And you guys ready to leave?  Is that what we're getting at?  Just real quick, Mike from Sports Sexy.  Oh, Mike. 
[00:49:00]  Brought the lovely ladies down today.  Mike.  He's the man.  Just want to thank you guys on behalf of the Sports Sexy Cafe located Route 46 in Totoa,  New Jersey.  Nice.  We brought the girls.  Where do you find these hot women?  To work for your place.  I hired every one of them.  Did you?  How many have you had sex with?  Oh, Jesus.  Probably a long time to ask that question.  Don't be.  Thank goodness.  Thank you, guys.  Don't have any girls in the room just said he better say one. 
[00:49:30]  You know that hand in life I was talking about?  Four aces right there.  That guy.  All right.  That guy's been dealt the aces.  You got like, I don't know, seven deuce offsuit.  All right.  Ben's freaking out.  We got to get everyone out.  By the building?  We're out of here.  We'll see you on the road.  All right.  Keith calls from downstairs before you take off.  Absolutely.  We're going to take a quick break.  If the building is yelling at you, Ben, pull out your hog and wrap it against the side  and knock it down. 
[00:50:00]  Pat from Monaki, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Ben?  Hey, how you doing, Pat?  We found someone that you got to bring down to Philly.  Block 614.  Yeah, the era of Pat from Monaki is officially over.  Oh, you think so?  Oh, yeah.  You think this guy's going to steal all your thunder?  I think so.  Just don't take my Patty.  She's mine.  I will battle you for her.  And this guy has ten toes.  Count them.  That's right. 
[00:50:30]  Show off.  In his dresser with other legs and appendages.  He even has a murderer's haircut.  Of course he does.  Oh, fuck.  All right, Pat, we got to let you go.  People are telling you, are you going to let me go?  Yeah, but Andrew's joining you on the ride, and we want you guys to check in a lot today,  all right?  Okay, Danny, there's officially 64 bikes, and there's more pulling up as I speak.  Very good.  Put Andrew on a five-second delay so it isn't cursed.  Thank you, Pat.  All righty.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  Bye.  Bye.  That, Andrew, is what we call gold.  Radio gold.  It is what we call gold.  It really is.  You rarely come across somebody that is like that on the air.  Radio gold.  The first time we ran into Stalker Patty, Patrick Minaki, Wheelchair Fred.  It only happens every once in a while.  When you're a radio prospector with your pan on the side of the river, and you're just looking  at nothing for so long, and then all of a sudden something just glimmers in the sunlight, 
[00:51:30]  and a big chunk of gold is there, that is Andrew.  Stalker Patty even knew it.  Yeah.  She saw it in the back of the room.  She got all bummed out.  I thought he was so good, I thought he was faking him.  I know.  It can't be real.  It can't be real.  Let me ask you, in the context of that finding gold freak show people, on the one hand, you  guys like these talented comics.  On the other hand, you look for these freak psychos.  Can you get to where would Norton fall into that category?  He seems to straddle both worlds rather well.  God, it took a while.  How's that stupid? 
[00:52:00]  I knew I assumed your mouth opened.  You knew it was going to be a bash on you.  I'd like to look the doors open and just walk through shit.  Kevin from Connecticut.  What's up, Kevin?  Guys, you've got to describe Andrew for me physically.  Wow.  He's a bit...  Well, let me tell you what I think, first of all.  All right.  Okay?  You know the Franks and Beans guy from Something About Mary?  I think he looks like him.  Not too far off, actually.  I'll tell you who he looks exactly like.  He's got a little bit of Melvin from Office Space. 
[00:52:30]  Definitely the Melvin from Office Space in there.  And he's got a little bit of the Adam Sandler's excited Southerner guy.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you put all those together.  He's like built and big as Leatherface.  Leatherface.  He looks like an unpleasant-looking Leatherface.  Take a picture of that leather smog.  Yeah, he's a big boy.  He's a big boy.  You ever see Hollywood Nights?  Yeah.  He looks like the guy at the end that goes,  Mother, I'm going to screw someone.  Dudley.  Yes, he looks exactly like Dudley from Hollywood Nights.  In a Steve C voice?  Yeah.  That's exactly what Dudley sounded like. 
[00:53:00]  Good find, Opie.  All right.  Let's...  Fantastic.  We're going to take a break.  Thanks, Kevin.  Yes.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll check in with Keith and the rest of the gang before they take off.  Can I at least promote Caroline so I don't have to do any other awful stuff?  Caroline's just...  Come on.  Meet us with Robinson and Bob Kelly's return engagement.  Oh, Bob Kelly's back.  His limping fatness will be all over the stage.  We got audio.  Get audio.  Bob Kelly.  We got audio.  Bob Kelly losing it on one of the...  Yeah, we had...  Oh, I heard about this. 
[00:53:30]  Don't you have to have it to lose it?  I guess someone wasn't enjoying his act and Bob Kelly lost it on this guy and just couldn't  get off it.  I'm going to say, go to a library, you intelligent person.  So we're going to play that next.  But Colin Quinn's going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  You sticking around for a little while or...  Yeah, a little while.  All right, cool.  Let's get out of here for a little bit.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  What can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, when I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their cars.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing frisbees to their cars.  Jumping rabbit.  God, you're showing your age, man. 
[00:55:00]  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Talk, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  My bandana.  Wow, it was such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented.  I did already.  There's no real idea.  He went into a time machine, and I already did it.  Killed themselves.  Right.  I've done it all. 
[00:55:30]  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car. 
[00:56:00]  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag. 
[00:56:30]  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo-hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  A bandana was me.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Calling all freaks.  That's hilarious.  Colin Quinn in studio today, playing Caroline's all this weekend. 
[00:57:00]  He's going to be in the New York area.  Definitely check out Colin Quinn.  Keith Robinson.  And fat Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly doing comedy with one leg, basically.  Oh, yeah.  And we've got some classic audio of Bob Kelly we're going to get to in a few minutes here.  But first, Anthony, it's the WOW motorcycle ride.  There's so much going on.  You want to explain really fast what's going to happen here?  We've got, Jesus, upwards of 70 motorcycles outside. 
[00:57:30]  And riders, obviously.  And they're going to be going down to Philly.  Right.  They're going to be going down to Philly on this WOW ride.  On the WOW ride.  And keep the cop help put together.  Yeah.  The cologne you're wearing is something a little child would give you.  Don't know why you caught me well.  I'm going to do that all day.  Oh, God. 
[00:58:00]  I can't stop doing it.  All day.  But it's Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  You get WOW on your vehicle.  And there's ladies all over America that will see that as a sign that you want to see boobs.  It's simple as that.  And we're going to be WOWing all the way from New York to Philly today.  Oh.  What's brilliant in a simplicity, might I ask?  Exactly.  There's some hotties on there today.  And if you listen closely, you can hear they're starting the engines up and ready to take off.  Let's say hi to Nathaniel.  Nathaniel.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Hi. 
[00:58:30]  I'm trying to get this organized chaos.  Would you like to speak to Andrew?  I'm sticking right by him.  Yeah.  Andrew's going to join Pat from Menachie for the ride down to Philly.  We'll be getting reports from him throughout the show.  Yes.  Very thank you.  Hello?  Hey, pretty loud down there, Andrew.  Yes, it's very loud down there.  I'm down here.  It's out there.  Yeah, are you psyched about riding down there with Pat from Menachie? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, very much.  Oh, Santa Claus.  Pat.  Have you ever met Pat, or is this the first time you're meeting Pat from Menachie?  He can't hear me anymore.  I'm not the guy that's talking about.  Do you hear that sound?  That sound is actually...  Do you hear that engine driving here?  That sound is the inside of Andrew's head when he watches Lizzie McGuire. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Keith!  We'll see if Keith can hear us.  Keith the cop.  Keith!  That's it.  It's just way too loud out there.  All right, the bikes are starting up, obviously, and they're starting their journey to Philly.  Ending at Club Risqué in Philadelphia.  And hot chicks all on their way down to Philadelphia.  And, yeah, give them support. 
[01:00:00]  You see them on the road, stay away from them.  Don't be any smartasses on the road.  But, you know, give me your support.  Wow, Al, man.  Is this Keith?  There's no way he's going to hear us now.  No one's going to hear anything.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  All right, go ahead, Keith.  All right, we're heading on out of here.  We're hitting the road right now.  Do you have Patty on the back of your bike?  Uh, yes, I have Patty on the back of my bike.  Oh, all those hot chicks, and he's got Patty on the back. 
[01:00:30]  Lovely, lovely.  Gentlemen, I'll talk to you in a little bit.  All right, well, you guys are going to do the Lincoln Tunnel?  Yeah, we're going to do the Lincoln Tunnel.  Because people are calling in.  They're between the station and the Lincoln Tunnel, so you're going to pick up some more bikers before you hit the tunnel.  Outstanding.  Looking forward to it.  All right, check in in a little while, Keith.  All right.  See ya.  All right, there you go.  Keith's the top, everyone.  Hey, uh, Nathaniel.  Yes.  Anything else to report?  No. 
[01:01:00]  No.  All right.  It's pretty crazy out there.  We're getting a lot of video and pictures taken for our websites, and we'll have that up later tonight.  All right, Nathaniel.  It's the majesty of a lot of people revving their engines.  I hear ya.  All right.  It's the majesty.  All right, very good.  Let's go to Pete downstairs.  Pete.  Yeah, I can barely hear you guys.  All right.  I'm in front of the Salisbury Hotel.  There's a tour group here called Christian Tours.  Everybody's got Jesus things on and crosses and everything else. 
[01:01:30]  Many motorcycles ripping up.  They look horrified.  We're scaring the shit out of them.  Yeah, the Christian Tour buses park right up on 57th here.  So, and huge gaggles of these Christians from out of town get off the bus, and they are petrified of all the motorcycles.  So, as well they should be, scantily clad girls on the back.  It's like everything they're against.  Everything cool, fun, and sexy.  All right, sounds like they're starting to take off.  So, the WOW motorcycle ride has begun to Philadelphia. 
[01:02:00]  It's going to be quite a long, long little parade of these guys.  A lot of bikes.  I don't know what the final count was.  We were up to like 64 with more cycles showing up.  Yeah.  I think we're over 80 at least.  There's going to be some joining up.  They'll be well over 100.  I know there's a bunch of cars, too, that are just going to take the trip down there.  We'll check in with Keith the cop and Andrew and Patrick Menachie in a little while.  Very cool.  Andrew and Pat in the same van. 
[01:02:30]  And Gary Sinise telling them about the rabbits in the back.  Also, Rich Voss coming in today.  Oh, yeah.  And we've got Scott Walterman, XM News.  He's going to be reporting from the Space Shuttle launch.  The Shuttle launch.  When is that thing supposed to go up?  That ain't happening today.  3.51 is supposed to be launch.  I thought it was supposed to happen this morning.  No.  3.51 in the afternoon.  Oh, okay.  It's supposed to be launch time.  But they've already had a problem.  Last night, one of the little protective coverings for one of the cockpit windows fell off, plummeted 
[01:03:00]  about 65 feet, and smashed into some of the tiles over one of the engine cowlings in the  back, and smashed some of the tiles, so they had to replace some of those.  So the tiles had to be replaced before the thing even lights up.  And they're worried a little bit about thunderstorms, too.  That might delay the launch.  A couple of tiles fall off.  What's going to happen?  A couple of tiles.  I don't think those things are very important.  And I don't think it's important that they had prepared for thunderstorms, either, since 
[01:03:30]  they're going into another planet.  Another planet?  I think they're talking about our planet here at launch time.  Thank God it's not, you know, it can handle itself against Martian invaders, but a little  rain.  That is a little odd.  That's a good point there, Colin.  No atmosphere and everything, yet, you know, a little rain.  A little rain.  You can take your goddamn car out in the rain.  I wish Voss was here right now, because the minute we said anything scientific, his face 
[01:04:00]  would have shown this fear like this.  He's like, you're kidding, school?  I hope they don't pick on me.  I know nothing about this.  I'll keep this side.  Jim, what?  I'll keep this side.  When we get up to Knight Avenue, I'll let you cut in and go and fuck.  What's going on, Jim?  This way we keep the street block.  Jim, what's up?  Yo, sorry, guys.  I'm talking to somebody else that's in another vehicle.  All right.  Left count was 72.  We're up to, what are we, up to Broadway here.  It looks gorgeous, I got to tell you.  It is a blast, guys. 
[01:04:30]  It's hard to hear you, even from back there in the car.  Very cool.  Yeah, a bunch of cars are following the bikes as well.  Yeah, we got it.  Well, unfortunately, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania says I can't ride right now.  But we got a nice crowd going here.  We're going to have a good time going down.  All right, cool, Jim.  Keep us updated on the progress, okay?  Yeah, you want me to leave my cell phone with you?  No, just keep calling in.  All right, later, bye.  We'll look for you.  Thanks, Jim.  Later, guys.  All right.  He counts 72 bikes so far. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, but the space shuttle, you'd think after two years, pieces wouldn't be falling off it before launch.  Yeah, you'd think whoever put that little protective thing on the window,  so, yeah, his head should roll, I think.  It's one of those, you know, everyone's watching kind of moments,  and make sure you're batting that thing down.  Amazing.  I don't think it'll launch, though, either.  I think it's going to be one of those, you know.  There's no way it launches.  Five, four, three.  Oh, we have a delay.  And then they delay, they pull the astronauts out of there,  and you've got to wait for another day. 
[01:05:30]  That happens every time.  Not like in the movies.  Well, we'll talk to Scott Walterman a little later tonight.  And who is he?  He's a very serious newsman.  He's a real news guy for XM?  For XM, yes.  What does he usually do when the shuttle isn't launching?  Because I don't think, is there an XM news channel?  Yeah, I think.  Is there?  I don't know.  We do our thing, and he does his thing.  I'd like to know if there's some kind of, what he does.  I think he does a little news here and there.  You think he gathers news for maybe Bob Edwards?  I think he does news for Deep Tracks. 
[01:06:00]  Deep Tracks, yeah.  What's Pink Floyd up to today?  I don't know what he does.  I don't know what half these people do down there in Washington.  But we'll check in with him.  Also, Chris Angel in studio today at 10 a.m.  Ben?  Yes.  He's that magician.  I've seen his billboard up outside the Midtown Tunnel.  He's a...  Ben, he wrote a note that says, boss lost.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  He bought him.  He bought him.  Where'd he be lost?  How can he be lost?  He's been here.  Oh, boy. 
[01:06:30]  He bombed on a napkin.  What did you think was going to happen?  I was going to look at this and go, boss lost.  Well, Jim, since you're booking guests now and not telling anyone.  No, no.  I didn't book guests.  Look how he just changed the subject of how his little note to Jimmy just tanked.  I know, but Jim, Jim, yeah.  Todd's like, yeah, Jim told me to come in tomorrow.  Well, he's in the Daily News and he mentions this in the Daily News.  Jim's producing the show now, secretly.  Someone should.  He's a part of the tsunami song and he was fired. 
[01:07:00]  And he called me.  He wanted to come in now that he's going to talk again.  So I'm like, yeah, email ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  And I'm not telling anybody out there to send pictures of Cox or anything to ben.sparks at xmradio.com  because that's distracting and it annoys Ben.  That would not be professional at all.  Don't send him things that sound good and then write shit dick in big letters because that would make his job difficult.  Todd apparently did not email Ben, but he's coming in tomorrow.  Well, that's cool.  Yeah, so you could have Todd in here.  Yeah, it doesn't change the fact that you invited him. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Sorry, I don't mean to change this.  Oh, we saw that picture being taken.  All right, look at this.  What did I do?  Nothing, sweetie.  It just happened.  Who is it, Andrew?  Yeah, he's got a picture of Andrew.  We saw them taking that picture and we were laughing at his expression.  You can now see our latest creation, Andrew, on opianthony.com.  There's a picture of him right there for your viewing pleasure.  Look at that smile.  I've never seen a human being look more uncomfortable in my life.  No.  He is.  Mike Buschetti, if you were a model. 
[01:08:00]  He is uncomfortable in his own skin.  Look at him.  Absolutely not a hint of a muscle in that body.  I'm going as far as Fontana, but then I can drop you off.  Stop!  You can't stop there.  I didn't see that face in the sleeper when you're a 16-year-old runaway.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:08:30]  You could take a nap in the back.  Wakes up all groggy and he's over her nude.  When he opens the trunk, it's like Billy Bats.  No, Tommy, no.  No, Andrew.  Andrew, no.  And he's not nude.  He's naked, except he's wearing socks and work boots.  Just making that sound.  Voss lost. 
[01:09:00]  I'm going to laugh all day reading that napkin.  That's a joke, though.  Doug out, Doug.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, I wanted to put out there that I'm doing a wow sticker stop tonight at the Virginia Beach  Funny Bone for Ridge Voss' show at 8 o'clock.  He's going to be in Virginia Beach tonight?  What's that?  He's going to be in Virginia tonight?  Yeah, he's in Virginia Beach, Virginia at the Funny Bone.  Tonight?  How's he going to get down there?  I don't know. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe he's fine.  Maybe.  All right.  Why?  Is he up there?  He's going to be here today.  He's supposed to be, but he's lost.  I know.  I just never get told.  I actually heard he's going to be doing radio down here on FM 99 WNLR in a little bit.  I was trying to keep an ear open so I can do wacky radio with him or something, but I don't  know.  Maybe he lied to you guys.  Something's up.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  God bless.  Thanks, Doug.  Let's go to Rob in Philly.  Rob, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  I was wondering, did you talk to Colin yet about his awful appearance on Flamie Poker 
[01:10:00]  and his garbage man hands?  Oh, my God.  Colin will play anything.  Do we have the audio?  He actually won the first round.  I won my awful first round.  Yeah, but he played awful.  You should not have won that.  I play against the grain.  What, do you want to play ace-king like an idiot?  Colin, I'm with you.  No, but you were playing like seven-deuce off suit.  And what happened?  I hit because it's all about the flop.  It doesn't matter.  You just got lucky.  I know.  Dumb people play ace-king, I win high two cards.  The flop is important. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  But I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe you should talk to me about this weekend in Vegas.  I was down $2,700.  I had four in the morning.  I had $40.  And I played high-stakes slots, three diamonds, $4,000.  Four grand?  Yes.  Nice.  Nice.  That is a nice hit.  And I won in celebrity poker, too.  And the only reason I lost the second game is because I let that dumb Phil get in my head  and I didn't play a 4-6.  That would have won it all.  And I told him that.  I saw him this weekend.  Phil Gordon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Speaking of the flop, what time is your show tonight?  Oh! 
[01:11:00]  It's actually tomorrow night, but thanks for promover.  Wow.  Flop.  Flop.  We got the audio of you on Celebrity Poker.  We had a lot of fun with this at your expense.  Let's go to the first track here.  I feel as if a fella can't take a joke.  Andrew, no.  No, Andrew.  Don't eat the cards.  I'll call.  I can't get enough of that guy.  I drew the death card. 
[01:11:30]  I feel like we could go home now.  I know.  He's the best.  Dream much, Will?  No one's going to remember anything else we do today.  He's got to be the spokesman for the show.  All about Andrew today.  Yeah, he does.  From now on.  Absolutely.  And you've got to track all the girls he met today and see what their next year is like.  All right.  Here we go.  Colin shows a jack of diamonds.  And Tripp Jackson is going to take Colin Quinn.  A nice spot here.  Folks, playing jack five offsuit, not a good idea.  Colin's getting very lucky here.  Lucky, you idiot.  I played my whole life.  Stupid.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  You play, what was it, jack five?  Yeah.  And the flop comes out, and there's two jacks in the flop.  Because the flop is not predicted.  But the odds of that happening are very slim.  They're not that slim.  Yes, they are.  You're probably going to lose your bet.  Yeah.  Because there's going to be crap comes out, or somebody's got an ace, and an ace comes out.  I know you my whole life.  I'm right away getting fresh.  I'm trying to...  Just a hug in a minute later.  No disrespect, Henry.  Are you nuts?  Can't just kill a little fucking manage, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to John in Virginia. 
[01:12:30]  John.  Yeah, Opie, he's an idiot.  I mean, he's talking about odds.  He's playing Caribbean stud.  It's the biggest house game in the casino.  Who's playing Caribbean stud?  I just play...  Who's playing that?  I'm an idiot when it comes to cards.  I'll be the first to admit it.  I play three-card poker, because you don't have to do anything.  I like the three-card poker.  That's a fun game.  You just sit there and watch what happens.  You get a good hand.  I don't play the Caribbean poker.  I play the three-card poker.  I made six grand in Atlantic City two weeks ago.  That's like playing do-seven-off suit.  You're going to do that once every 50 times. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, all right.  Oh, bullshit, Werner.  All right, John wants to call me an idiot.  Ask him why I didn't...  Thanks, John.  I think he meant to say I was an idiot, and he was just talking to you.  No, because I agree with you.  Well, I mean, guys are all idiots.  I like playing against the grain.  I like playing against the grain.  It's fun.  All right, John.  No, just because we're not smart, because we're idiots.  What did you mean?  Read emotional intelligence.  Huh?  New airport book.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  What's up, boys?  I'm in a red car in the back of the procession.  There's probably about 10 or 15 cars following the motorcycle ride. 
[01:13:30]  They're getting into the Lincoln Tunnel for anybody in Jersey who wants to meet them on  the other side.  Lincoln Tunnel, huh?  The traffic's really screwed up right now.  I don't know if it's like the tunnel normally, or these 80 maniacs on motorcycles right now.  It could be, you know, rush hour in midtown Manhattan.  So are they right at the Lincoln Tunnel?  Yeah, I'm trying to get into the tunnel right now.  All right, very good.  Because there are people on the other side of the tunnel that are going to join the Wow  Motorcycle Ride to Philly.  And keep an eye out for a used Mercedes coming the other way.  Rich Voss, I'm late to a strapper. 
[01:14:00]  Hey, by the way, guys.  I'm going to plug my shark.  Huh?  There's one guy in the truck who's got a great idea.  He put a bunch of signs on his car so that it said, you know, if you want to listen to  Opie and Anthony, tune in to, you know, these two FM channels to, you know, weed off his  modulator.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Oh, yeah.  So if you get close to the car, you can...  A lot of people have been doing that for us.  That's very cool.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Later, boys.  So John is joining the Wow Ride.  He's behind all the sickles.  Another track, another cut from Colin Quinn on Celebrity Poker here. 
[01:14:30]  And Colin with an 8-10.  So his 18 to me is going to...  Looks like he's calling this out of position.  This is just horrible.  Colin calls.  No, no, no, Phil.  He has an 8-10 off suit.  Yeah, okay.  You must have missed that.  Yeah, and Phil, what happened that hand?  What happened that hand, Colin?  I won.  You did?  Good to be home, fellas.  You did?  Of course I did.  I won that game.  I lost the second game only because I beat everybody out the second game.  I did all the dirty work.  Then Brad Garrett beat me because I bitched, because I listened to Phil Garrett in my head 
[01:15:00]  and I didn't play a 4-6 same suit that ended up with a...  We would have been a straight flush, probably.  Cocksuckers get every 8-10 on the deck.  What do you say there, guys?  I don't know.  Kind of like that.  Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.  All right.  You're saving up to be, Colin.  Do you wish?  Barnes' idea of being funny.  I ain't even cheating yet.  Then he laughed because he's a fucking guy with scars on his face.  What do you say there, Bob?  Can I like that?  Make it. 
[01:15:30]  That's precisely what I thought.  No reaction from Barnes at all.  Let's say hi to Craig the cop.  Craig?  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  What do you got today, Craig?  Hey, I want to let you guys know, the Turnpike has a website set up that you can view traffic  traveling live on the pike today.  Okay.  And anybody who wants to check out the bikes going down to Philly, they'll be able to view  it out live.  All right.  What's the site?  It's www.state.nj.us.backslash Turnpike. 
[01:16:00]  I know.  Backslash NJ.  That's why I want him to read the website out.  That's easy.  Right.  A handy one.  That's almost like Yahoo.  Right.  It's so easy.  Just tell him to go to JerseyTurnpike.com and the web link them right to the cameras.  All right.  Thank you, Craig.  All right, guys.  Good luck, man.  All right.  And then you can sit and watch traffic.  That's a wonderful website.  Everyone's helping us out, though.  They're helping us out for the wild motorcycle ride with Keith the cop, Anthony, who has Stalker  Patty on the back of his ride. 
[01:16:30]  Sure he does.  He didn't take her?  You mean he dropped her off?  I don't know.  She says the North Vietnamese make us take the weapons.  Oh, bullshit, Warner!  I heard Patty is on the back of his motorcycle.  I hope so.  She may have had a stunning makeover from the time she was up here until the time she  got out on the motorcycle.  You think she fell off the back accidentally?  I think she had a stunning makeover.  I'm sure she was on the back of his bike for the photo op. 
[01:17:00]  I was brutally drowned into the street, but I had to walk today anyway.  I got road rash.  This is wonderful.  All right, another...  I'm going to join the Hells Angels.  Fuck the pagans.  I'm going to kick a little ass.  Patty.  She turns into a motorcycle mama.  Oh, biker bitch, showing her tits and...  She already does that.  Yeah, she does.  Yeah, we turned her into a slut.  We talked about that recently. 
[01:17:30]  You turned her out.  A virgin slut.  Here's another cut from Colin Quinn on celebrity poker.  Colin is what is known in the professional poker world as a calling station.  If you can find a guy like this to play poker with you at a high level, you will murder him.  Play me then, Phil, at a high level, you scumbag.  But you can't win playing as passively as he does.  Shut your face, stupid.  I had no cards and I won.  They were just amazed at how you played. 
[01:18:00]  I got to give it to you.  I won!  You did win.  You did.  You did.  Yeah, but Phil's right.  You kept going off suit.  That's all suit.  Who gives a damn?  Yeah, but you weren't playing like...  You weren't taking like a king ace or a jack-o-ling.  Oh, bullshit, Werner!  I sat down and played cards with Phil.  I had a game with Phil in L.A., and he ripped me to shreds.  Beat you, you mean?  He killed me.  I'll play him when I want to be destroyed.  He's got such a big mouth, I'll play him with real money, one-on-one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, on the show, it'll be semi-promotionable. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know, let's ask the producer.  Do you think that would be his biggest hard mention in the Daily News?  That's a very nice little mention for the O.P. Anthony program.  Shut up, they don't need this local mention.  They've got to invite people on.  Every time they mention a paper, shut your trap.  On the next page, they're advertised, dum-dum.  Don't produce.  You don't know what you're doing.  Do stand-up.  Study your acting.  You've got a craft to get ready for this.  I'm sorry.  Join a Bexin today.  Are you really?  Are you taking acting lessons or a class? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, he's teaching you.  Rushing up.  You should?  Really?  Jim's not a bad actor.  I know it because the other guys stink so badly.  Really?  You ever see Keith Act?  Oh.  I've seen it in the sketches that you guys did.  Yeah.  Even in those sketches, we're trying to be, like, ironically bad.  Even then, Voss's shame spiral starts, and he's like this.  His own door is.  His shame spiral.  He goes into, like, a shit.  Because the one thing in acting, you have to, like, be, accept yourself.  Right.  You've got to be confident in your work.  Even if you, it doesn't matter what you are.  You have to say, this is all I have.  But even then, he's like.  And he starts getting, like, trying too hard. 
[01:19:30]  His door is.  He just gets sucked down in his own, like, suckiness.  His own horrible self-esteem.  And he's like.  I can't wait to.  You know, Voss always hated me in comedy.  That was, like, a big.  Voss used to slam me.  And to this day, every time I call him on it, his eyes.  He goes, no, I didn't.  He starts laughing, but his eyes turn away.  Because he used to call me.  Because he was so dumb.  Norton and them kind of recognize, oh, this guy's a real comic.  But Voss was so dumb.  He's like, I think he's, like, an alternative guy.  He didn't realize that was actually funny.  And to this day, he doesn't think I'm funny.  They have to tell him that I'm funny. 
[01:20:00]  Because you're, you know, it might take that you've got to think a little bit.  Yeah.  And maybe have read a newspaper in the past month to understand some of what Colin's saying on stage.  Very funny.  I love the fact that you come up with new shit on a weekly basis.  And it's hysterical.  I'm kissing ass a little bit.  But I've seen Colin many times, and he's hysterical.  Colin does impersonations, and if you close your eyes, you think he was the real people.  Oh, not easy. 
[01:20:30]  But Voss, you know.  Well, Voss, he's an uneducated doofus.  He's a buffoon.  Well, where is Voss?  I know.  He really, you know.  He was supposed to be here about a half hour ago.  And Colin's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow night, right?  Yeah.  Not all weekend?  All weekend.  All weekend.  Okay, good.  Bob Kelly, the one-legged Samoan, and Keith Robinson.  I'm buying a Learjet off of eBay.  I'll be there in lickety-split.  I'm flying in for a Rolls Royce.  It broke down while he was driving. 
[01:21:00]  While he's test driving it, after he put $1,000 down on it.  Oh.  It smelled like sauerkraut and bratwurst.  Actually, though, he does have a lot of new topical material.  He said, Al-Qaeda's trying to kill me, and I'm dodging.  All right, Dan, we're going to take a break.  We'll check in with Keith the Cop.  You care about those bombings in London?  Yeah, how about those Nazis?  When we get back, we'll check in with Keith the Cop, see where he's at in his Wow Motorcycle Ride to Philadelphia, okay? 
[01:21:30]  Roy, also, the Bob Kelly audio.  We've got to get Bob Kelly on.  Oh, I've got to hear this.  You've got to stick around for the Bob Kelly audio.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  We'll do that next, all right?  If producer Norton gets me a soda in the place, I only want it if he petches it.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman who sets his shirt off?  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.

[01:27:30]  The turnpike  About five minutes  Or so  They'll be on the turnpike  In less than five minutes  Probably  There's heavy traffic  At 495  Again  So you guys  Have pretty much  Made it out of the tunnel  Yeah  Everybody's out of the tunnel  I'm the last car  I believe  Everybody's out of the tunnel  By the way  That cycle  Pat's Andrew  I don't think  Pat's coming back  From the ship alive  Yeah we want Pat from  Minaki to give us a call  Pat  Come on  Alright thank you John  Later boys  Alright so they pretty much  Have left the tunnel  And they're very close  To the New Jersey turnpike  As they head down to Philly

[02:39:30]  Right  But actually I think  I just lost the whole group  Ha ha ha  Alright Jim thank you  I don't know if they pulled over  Alright later guys  Good luck to you  They're going to be at  Club Risque  Later on this morning  Want to take a quick call  From Scott Walterman  Yeah  Ooh  Scott  Yeah  You're live on the  Opie and Anthony program  Hey what's up  Here he is  Scott Walterman  Are we broadcasting  The shuttle launch today  On XM  Yeah we're going to carry it  On channel 133  We're going to go on the air  About 3.30 eastern  The launch is scheduled 
[02:40:00]  For 3.51 eastern  12.51 pacific  So we'll do about 20 minutes  Leading up to the launch  Listen to the launch  And stay with the vehicle  Until it gets to orbit  Now let me ask you a question  Because a lot of people  A friend of mine was telling me  That the launch  What they're looking at  Is possible thunderstorms  Now is there going to be  Some kind of a thing  Because there was at one point  A weather issue  Or is there not  Like anything in that  Kind of a works  Yeah  Yeah there's an issue  With the weather  They've got to have  A 20 mile clear  Around the radius  Of the Cape  The skies have to be clear 
[02:40:30]  No thunderstorms  Because in case  Something goes wrong  And they've got to  Bring the shuttle back  And land here  At the Kennedy Space Center  Is this thing  Taking off today Scott?  Got a percentage?  I'd give it an 80  85%  85%  Now we had a little  Mishap this morning  With the window cover  Coming off  Yeah that was kind of weird  Yeah  Is that making people  Nervous down there  At the Cape?  Kind of as a woman thing?  You'd think after two years  We'd have stronger glue 
[02:41:00]  You know  It's kind of a weird deal  When it first happened  You know  I was like  Oh my god  Because especially  Since you know  The problem with the Columbia  Was  Right  Tile related  Falling down on the tiles  Yeah  People are saying  This could be a problem  But what happened was  There was windows  On the shuttle  You know  They got the windshield  And then there's  These two windows  Right above  The command capsule  Inside the vehicle  And when it's sitting  On the pad  They have covers  On the actual glass  On the windows 
[02:41:30]  One of them fell off  Yeah  Dropped about 60 feet  And damaged  Two heat tiles  Yeah  Now the heat tiles  Are glued to these panels  Which are removable  So they pulled the panel off  They have a spare  They put the spare back on  And they say  Not a problem  They're good to know  Well that area  Isn't really that critical either  As far as piles up  That area around Cape Canaveral  And this is not to be racist  Is not safe  I had tinted panel windows  And a couple of 
[02:42:00]  Let's say Latinos  Came along  And then I left it for 20 minutes  And they were gone too  So they might have something  To do with them on that  Are you  Saying that perhaps  Somebody stole  Or was trying to steal  These panels on the  Well I'm saying  I know the area  In Florida  There's a lot of  Vatos locos  As we like to call them  And they're known  To remove panels  In a matter of seconds  Scott are you familiar  With Colin Quinn?  No  A comedian  Colin Quinn  Yeah yeah yeah  He was on MTV  On that game show  Wow  Thanks Scott  That's exactly who he is  And exactly how you should say it 
[02:42:30]  Thanks Scott  MTV that was my last gig  Remote control  No no no  That game show  I want to know  A little bit  Scott what do you do  With XM  You're a news guy  Yeah  We don't have  An XM news station  Though do we  No  But we do a lot  Of stuff on the air  Like this  So you kind of  Run around  From channel to channel  Whenever a story  Pops up  And kind of chime in  Because I know  We have CNN  And Fox  What do you do  With XM  Yeah that's a good question 
[02:43:00]  I was trying to figure this out  I was like  Yeah we got this news guy  He's going to be talking  About the shuttle thing  It's like  What does he do  When the shuttle  Isn't launching  Yeah I'm trying to keep  That question from being answered  That's good  Yeah  From being asked  Right  From being asked  Because they might say  What does this guy do  I haven't done any reports  On the shark attack  Scott  Right  What was your last story  That you covered  For XM  Yeah  We did Live 8  Oh Live 8  Okay  That's not really a story  What was the guy  That was crying  That wasn't him  Was it  No  That was Bruce Kelly 
[02:43:30]  Did you hear that one Scott  Oh yeah  You're right over  The guy crying  That crying guy  From the who  Did you hear Bruce crying  Yeah that was on our channel  Yeah  I know  It really sounded tasteful  Especially after the bombing  Last week  That he was crying  Because they didn't play  Anything off live at Leeds  Is this going to be  Your first live shuttle launch  There Scott  No no  I've been here many times  Before I came to XM  I was at NBC  And CBS  And ABC  And all the other  And are you like  A science reporter  Or  No  Just general assignments 
[02:44:00]  But you happen to be there  For other shuttle launches  Just coincidentally  You were covering it  For another channel  Yeah  It's usually left  To the science or tech guys  It's pretty cool stuff  Yeah I've seen one  From about 50 miles out  At night  And it was pretty intense  Yeah  Yeah we're about  Three miles from the pad  And  When that thing takes off  You know  The first thing you see  Is the engine's light  Yeah  And then you actually  Like get kicked in the chest  Like somebody like  Took their  The flat hand 
[02:44:30]  And pounded you in the chest  Again that might be  Some of the people  Colin was speaking about  Then the ground  Starts to shake  You hear the rumble  It's pretty impressive  Yeah  And that's from  Three miles away  Oh yeah  So if you're like  If you're two or one mile  It's got to be even more  Yeah  It's funny  Because NASA  Sent out an email  This morning  They said  Don't turn your car alarms on  Because the shuttle  Will set them off  That's terrific  That's terrific  That is funny  What's the closest you could get  This is it 
[02:45:00]  Three miles  Well as a civilian  Yeah I hear you  I mean I assume  NASA's got people closer  But  I would say the astronauts  Are a little closer  Yeah  Yeah  Anthony  Right in that thing  So they're really thinking  It's going to happen today  Right  Yeah  I would say  You know  They're given  I think the last  Weather projection  Is their main concern  Right now  Is 60-40  60 that they'll launch  But  If I had to bet on it  I'd bet on launch today 
[02:45:30]  Well  No shit  Yeah  Alright  Alright Scott  Thank you so much  Alright  Scott Walterman  Have fun  Enjoy the show  And hopefully  It will be safe  You should videotape people  That are two miles away  Getting blown back by you  That would be cool  Well it's going to be on  XM 133  Starting at what time  About 3.30  At 3.30  Now Scott  Exactly  What happens  As this thing  Starts to take off  Like exactly 
[02:46:00]  What is going on  When they count down  And what is the mood  And stuff like that  I think people are pretty  You know  We are going to make  No friends  At XM  None whatsoever  At XM  If you keep hanging up  On people  In mid-sentence  Hey that was a group effort  Yeah  Just because Jimmy sets it up  Doesn't mean you got to hit it  I didn't set it up  I was genuinely interested  Like you all didn't look at me  Go and click  Everyone did  Yes  Let's say hi to Tony in Philly

[02:51:00]  Out of shape blubbering idiots number one  And out of shape blubbering idiot number two  The Kelly sisters  Yeah  That was my favorite  The Kelly sisters  Wow run we lost Keith  What does this mean  Steve  Yeah  What's up  We lost Keith  What do you mean  We don't know  A bunch of us  We don't know what Keith is  I think they peeled off  And went on to the Garden State Parkway  We're on the Jersey Turnpike  They're all over the place 
[02:51:30]  Oh yeah we are  But we picked up a few people  Somebody's got a flag hanging out of a broken down ram charger  I think it told them the roof on  Wow lost Keith  Yeah we lost Keith  He's got to be all alone with Patty  Alright  Oh no  Hopefully we get Keith to call  Hopefully we get Pat from Minaki to call again  With our new creation Andrew  Yeah they're there with Pat and Andrew  Riding together  We haven't heard from them at all  Hold on a second 
[02:52:00]  Pat, empty van, Keith  Patty  I don't want to think of the possibilities  Alright  Thank you Steve  Alright  Alright  Anthony we were teasing  We were just talking actually  We weren't teasing  That assault on the media in Philly  That was going down  Yeah  Now we got an update  Let's say hi to Scott and PA  Scott  Yeah  What's up  I just saw your assault on the media on 10  Oh you did  What happened  I live about 30 minutes north of Philly  That was kind of weak  But it was a good execution  I'll give them that  Well walk us through 
[02:52:30]  What happened  The guy walked up  He had signs with tape on four corners of the sign  And he stuck it right to the window  Right behind where they were sitting  Yeah  But it was a little dark  Because they put the yellow  The yellow words on the black background  Yeah  But it was real dark  So you really couldn't see it  But it was slick  I'll give them that  A little dark  It was a little too high  Alright  Thank you Scott  Alright  Another report coming in from Jim in Philly  Jim  Yeah  Joe  Oh Joe sorry  It was terrible  The assault on the media was dreadful 
[02:53:00]  You made out the letter W  If the guy didn't say what he was doing  I would have just thought it was some retard from Philly  Slapping signs on the thing  Oh  It was an awful assault on the media  It was absolutely dreadful  All you saw was the back window  They're tinted  And a guy walked up  And stick three pieces of poster board to it  And another guy come by  About a minute later  And rip them down  It was absolutely horrible  Alright guys  Watch it out  The sound of failure right here  That might take over for the crickets Anthony 
[02:53:30]  I like that one  And possibly the car crash by the way  My favorites  Alright well  He attempted the assault on the media  The best one in July  I will win the MiFi  And a day in the studio  With Opie and Anthony  Okay  We're going to do this every month  By the way for a while  Yeah  And so far  Buffalo Paul's in the lead  And his video is up on opieandanthony.com  Okay  Right  Alright we could do  Celebrity Fit Club audio  We could do  The ONA TV edit thing  The only reason I'm thinking of doing this again  Because it made it up on  Fark.com  Yeah it's up on Fark 
[02:54:00]  And I think this is worth playing again  Yep  What do you think  I liked it  Because the Celebrity Fit Club audio  Is going to take some time  And we got Chris Angel  Just filling out paperwork  And then he's going to come in  And do some magic for us  Ah  I've seen his stuff  It's pretty cool  Yeah  Yeah he keeps you interested  I like magic  You like magic Jimmy  It scares me  Sometimes I get very frightened  Yeah  What's that  What happened  What happened  Your man Clayton at the front door  Is a very diligent worker  Had me sign in  Really  I'm like  Do I really have to 
[02:54:30]  He says yeah  Roberto walked in  He goes oh no you can go  I'm like  Excuse me  Why am I signing in  Yeah why do you sign in  He goes oh aren't you working for Chris Angel  No  Oh boy  No I'm Anthony's brother Joe  That kind of threw him for a little bit of a loop  He's just an intern  Why is an intern doing a  He's a kid  Sign in  Why is an intern at the front door like that  Uh oh  Where is Master Poe  Where's Poe  Where is he  Where did he go  I don't know he's not here  He's not in the front  We haven't seen him  He's gone  Uh oh 
[02:55:00]  Went off to  Did he go on the motorcycle ride  Did he go to Philly  No  Don't know  All the bikes were gone  And he was still here  What happened to Master Poe  He's off on some secret mission  Killing something  I had to go  Gentlemen  Seek and destroy mission gentlemen  Where is he  That's a damn good Poe impression  Everyone does their Poe impression around here  Steve does the best one  But the intern is now the head of security  Is that true  What is that  And who's that guy 
[02:55:30]  He looks like an FBI agent  He looks like John La Roquette  Is what he looks like  What the hell is going on around here  That guy's in with Chris Angel  Yeah  He's his assistant  Why is an intern sitting in a security booth  Head of security  Well he's like I said  He's pretty diligent  Pretty diligent  Yeah  Ah okay  Travis will get to the bottom of this  Nice haircut  Yeah  Jesus  That haircut  Is very marine  Okay  It's got like the jarhead thing going  Yeah  Are you going to shoot the president  For Jodie Foster 
[02:56:00]  At the fucking sociopath  That's it right there  Yeah  Travis Bickle  Yeah Travis Bickle  Thanks  But uh no  Apparently Poe had to leave  And so he put Clayton in charge  Of watching the door  Had to leave for what  I have no idea  He just said he has to leave  Ben knows why  And  Okay  Ben  Well where's Ben  Where's Ben  Ben knows why  Ben knows why  Master Poe left  Alright now we're  I opened up a god damn can of worms  Didn't I  You gotta know  Why is there an intern  A security guy  Now we're searching for the producer  Of the opening Anthony show 
[02:56:30]  That could take a while  I know  It looks like he's looking at a record album  Really closely  That'll be him  But he doesn't even like yes  Yeah  Where's Ben  He must have the sniffles  Why is he looking so closely  In himself in a mirror  Ben's on his tiny little cell phone  He's pacing outside the door  On his tiny little cell phone  Don't  Don't  Ben  What happened  Come here  Wow is Ben pissed now  Where's Ben  I don't know  Here he is  There he is  What happened to Master Poe 
[02:57:00]  He went to court  He's in court  Oh  Oh  What about the building guy  What happened to  What's wrong with the building guy  I guess  Outside on the sidewalk  Was a mess  Too bad  Tell the building guy  To go clean it  We're busy  It's a street  In Manhattan  You know  We don't give Ben enough credit  He has to deal with shit  That we never hear about  I know  Yeah  They left the mess on the sidewalk  So they're giving Ben hell today  Let's give Ben a broom  And tell him to get out there  And fix things  Right  Sweep up  Alright anyway  One of our new bits 
[02:57:30]  Is this TV edit thing  We love this  Yeah  We gotta get some more examples  Of movies  Where they butcher it for TV  Yeah you got your favorite movies  You watch them on regular TV  And they butcher them  They cut them apart  They take the words  And add in their own words  For the curse words  To clean them up  And they're ridiculous  And they're done in different voices  And we figured  It was a good opportunity  To take some of the stuff  That's been on our show  Because it's satellite radio  We're able to speak our minds  And say whatever we want  As far as language goes  And maybe replace it  Like they do 
[02:58:00]  On those network television movies  So maybe we can get back  On commercial radio  Yeah this is the way  Our show would be  Oh thank you  This is a great idea  Now let's say  Infinity Broadcasting  For example  Comes to us and goes  Look  We need you  To do let's say  A morning show  Because our morning guy's gone  And why would they do that  Let's say they did  And  Let's just say they did  They go  We need  A cleaned up  FCC friendly version  Of your program  This is perfect  For what we'd give them 
[02:58:30]  This would be what we would give them  And by the way  Steve is working on  A couple new ones  Of course he is  Steve's always working  And this is on  FARK.com  F-A-R-K.com  Uh huh  We love FARK.com  So basically  Here's Jim Norton  Going off  And then we'll play  The TV edit  Of the same line  Hey guys  How you doing  Long time list  Glad to have you back  Jeff welcome to the program  Hey uh  You gotta tell you  You gotta get rid of Norton  Dump this guy  Because he sucks  What  Alright  This is that same

[03:11:30]  A press conference somewhere  And then we'll ask him  Where's the press conference  And he'll be very vague  You never know  Yeah it's in a hotel room  And oh what networks  Are showing up  Well there's a couple of guys  Listen guys  I gotta go  I gotta go  And then just doing  The hackiest stuff for us  Yeah  Well hopefully  I won't do shit for you  He made Art Bell sick  Huh  Art Bell finally booted  Kreskin off his show  Because Kreskin's funny  Art Bell show  And he did some UFO thing  That was just such  Bump  Oh right right  I remember the UFO thing  Oh we talked to him  About the UFO thing  He was gonna  What was that one about again  That the UFO was gonna  Show up over Nevada 
[03:12:00]  And it was gonna be videotaped  He had predicted  It was gonna happen  And then  I don't even know  What happened  He said it showed up  There was no record of it  No video  He said it  Yeah  Whacko you have to be  For fucking Art Bell  And go oh look  Beat it  Finally  Yeah  Beat it  Stupid  But he's like  He had a whole gimmick  Where he was like  Doing predictions  And stuff like that  What's your gig  What's my gig  Well my gig is  On A&E  I do a variety of things  I do these large demonstrations  Of the mind  Body and spirit 
[03:12:30]  So like recently  I hung by four fish hooks  Through my back  From a helicopter  A thousand feet above  Valley of Fire  In Las Vegas  Stop  Like Omar  Yeah it was pretty  Pretty fucking insane  You got the marks  Yeah  The marks on my back  I lit myself on fire  In a 20 foot fireball  In the middle of  Fremont Street  Completely in a round  I actually did a twist  Where at the end  After burning for 45 seconds  I vanished  And was one of the guys  Putting me out  I got it 
[03:13:00]  Jonathan gave us some corn  I shot a .223 round  He's a marksman  A lot of people don't know that  But he's really into guns  And I caught it  33 feet away from me  In a metal cup  That I was holding in my mouth  Rob Zombie  Buried me alive  Which is something  Houdini always wanted to do  Tried to do  Got pulled out of the earth  I was 9 feet under the ground  6 feet of dirt  Over me  And basically thought  It took me a half hour  To escape  And dig my way out  Took me an hour  20 minutes  What else 
[03:13:30]  Wait wait  That wasn't an illusion  Of some sort  You had to get out  And dig your way  Out of the ground  A lot of what I do  Is completely real  No bullshit  A lot of it's  Completely bullshit  So yeah  It's like I try to  Blur the line  Between what's real  And what's reality  How did you breathe  On the ground  It was  It was basically  Honestly  Here you go  Here's the answer  In the coffin itself  It had air  I do something called  Shallow breathing  Which is something  That you really maximize  The air that you have  In a  We do shallow thinking  And basically 
[03:14:00]  When I dug my way out  There's air pockets  In the dirt  Because when I  Put the dirt back in there  They're not compacting it  So it's basically  You can get little areas  Like a little mole  You have to look for  Fucking air pockets  In dirt  Jesus  That's really  Cost of all that  Unfortunately  I don't have a radio show  So I have to like  Actually do shit  That I can kill myself  Remember that guy  There was a guy  That's got that  Glass coffin  And he got into it  And they piled the dirt on  And then after a few feet 
[03:14:30]  Of dirt on  You just saw the dirt  And then cement  Yeah  And you just saw  The whole thing go blip  And a little air bubble  Went bloop  Out of the cement  Dead  Guy named Bill Burris  Yeah  Actually we took the footage  And just wanted to show people  That you know  What the consequences could be  And you know  Unfortunately  He lost his life  Was that because  He puts a thousand pounds  Of cement  On top of a glass coffin  It was like sixteen  Plexiglas  Yeah sixteen thousand pounds  He caved in on him  And just crushed him  Oh yeah  Suffocated on  That's it  You're done  Spent  The video of it is  They pulled him out  Immediately right 
[03:15:00]  Yeah  It's actually on my episode  Rob Zombie hosted  We actually watched that  And we have that  We got that footage  In the show  So people can see that  But you know  It's  I actually put a little  In honor to him  And other magicians  Who have lost their life  There's twelve magicians  Who try to catch a bullet  In their mouth  And died  So you know  A lot of what I do  Is completely real  Jesus is no  Yeah  Well that's kind of cool  I like how you said that  Blurring the line  Between what's bullshit  And what's real  Or an illusion  That kind of keeps people thinking 
[03:15:30]  Like  Right  Is he really doing this  Or is it set up  And an illusion  Yeah exactly  I think that's what  That's what makes it interesting  I think magic  Has been  You know  Treated  In a way  Where it's not popular culture  It's like  A cheap novelty  Magicians are shoving girls  With leotards  And fucking boxes  And it's like  Really tired and old  And really cheesy  So I wanted to do it  In a way  Where I combined  You know  Original music  And sensibilities  Of today  You know  Chris you said  That was a 223 round 
[03:16:00]  Yeah  That's a military  That's a military round  That is a high velocity round  At 33 feet  Yep  But we had  We had a metal pop  I had to take a mold  Of my mouth  Was that Bravo Sierra  Or  And it was  A specific type of metal  That was a ballistics expert  Actually designed it  With this metal fabricator  And they made it  They did testing  Testing on it  Testing is so fast  And he shot you in the mouth  Yeah  He had a laser sight on  So he made sure  He lined it up first  And that wasn't BS  You can watch it for yourself man  Man  Wow 
[03:16:30]  I don't know if you're friends with him  But I can't stand David Blaine  I can't stand him  I like David  We should actually call him  And see why he's such a fucking wimp  And he won't face as big as Fear Me  Oh  I thought we should do  Really  Yeah  Because he goes in the press  And he like  You know  He has  You know  Things  Oh  I'll do something  With Chris side by side  And see who can do something longer  And then he fucking stands in a box  And goes to London  Because he can't face me here  And  He's a hack man  I have to say  When he was just standing  In a block of ice 
[03:17:00]  And  And then does that  The glass box thing in London  It's like  Who cares  And people  I mean  It's not elevating the art form  It's not using his ability  It's not very provocative  I always say that  I don't look behind me  I always look ahead of me  And  You know  The world's big enough for everybody  But unfortunately  What I don't like  Is people that go around  And say shit  And then they can't back it up  Can you do that floating thing he does  Or is that  How does he do that  Yeah actually  I do a lot  On this  The premiere night  On July 20th  At 1030  At 10 o'clock  The first show  So it's the second

Eight of diamonds  Turn it open  Get the fuck out of it  Eight of diamonds  Usually there's like three steps  To a trick like that  No  This was just  It's there 
[03:23:00]  Was it eight of diamonds?

[03:23:30]  It's not demons  We know that this is just a thing  And it's just  No one can figure it out  A lot of it though  Is  You guys go to a break  If we have a chance  I'll try something with you  Like basically  To get inside your head  I'm talking about your brain  But it's basically  You know  Mentalism  And uses a lot of psychology  And stuff like that  And a lot of people  Perceive it as psychic  And so there's no such thing  As a psychic stone  Exists  It's bullshit  But basically  What you do  Is you utilize  Your abilities 
[03:24:00]  To read human behaviors  You know a little bit  About psychology  And have some techniques  And you can create  You know  These effects  That people really believe  That you do this stuff  And unfortunately  There's a lot of people out  Like you know  Jonathan Edwards  And others  Who you know  Exploit and take advantage  Of people who are vulnerable  For their money  I don't believe in  Jonathan Edwards  At all  It's doing cold reading  Man  That's all it is  What do you mean  Explain  Cold reading is  When you  You basically  If I'm talking to you  And I say  You know  I'm basically pumping you 
[03:24:30]  For information  And you're telling me  The answers  But yet I  Present it as if  You know  I'm finding things  And by your reactions  By your body language  By you know  How you react  I know whether  I'm getting hot or cold  It's like playing  You know  Right  You know  It's like hot and cold  Searching around  Yeah  So you basically make  A general statement  Just by the way  You see somebody dressed  Or you know  You see a girl  And you know  If you always say  That you know  You're vulnerable  But you're  But you have a guard up  You know  Everybody can relate to that 
[03:25:00]  And they're going to think  You're talking about  You know  Them  And eventually  You get more information  You can just  You know  You can just  Really fuck with people  As a magician  Right  Or a mentalist  How  Do you ever see  The Uri Geller  Just eat  On a tonight show  How uncomfortable  Is that  What was that about again  See the problem is  Amazing Randy right  Is the one that sung  Yeah  Amazing Randy  Is actually a friend  And  He better be a friend  Yeah  He wrecks careers  Yeah  No well  You can't go out there  And claim that you  Fucking do this stuff  And he's doing it  Like I just did for you 
[03:25:30]  The fork stuff  You know  He does a lot of fork  The difference is  That he claims  Like he has his power  Or something like that  And  And  That doesn't fly  You know  He made a good living at it  But  But yeah  It was funny  And Johnny Carson  When he put him to the test  He's like  You know  Do this  And  Under these conditions  He's like  I don't feel it right now  It was something like  He would move the table  And he would notice  The way the thing moved  He was really subtle  And he would know  Where the water was  Or something  But then I think  Randy  Amazing Randy  He said  Glue it down  Where he can't pull that shit  And this dummy
