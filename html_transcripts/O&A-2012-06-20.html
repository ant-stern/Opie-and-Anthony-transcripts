<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, notable for Opie's absence and the presence of Jim Norton and Uncle Paul Hargis, opened with a discussion about the extreme heat, ironically advising against sensible heat safety measures.  This segued into a surprisingly graphic discussion about the smell of elderly people, fueled by Norton's nursing home community service experience.  The conversation veered into bathroom gadgets for the elderly, leading to a discussion of “Postyvac,” a penis pump, and potential insurance fraud.  This sparked a detailed exploration of various sexual practices, including vacuum-pumped vaginas, latex bondage, and autoerotic asphyxiation, referencing a specific case involving Jade Vixen (Edith Ma).  The hosts then discussed Mike Tyson's Broadway debut (directed by Spike Lee), sharing a Las Vegas anecdote involving Tyson and a woman.  The conversation shifted to the appearance of transsexuals, referencing a Tumblr site, followed by a discussion on porn, its shift from physical media to online access, and the potential discovery of pornography by a spouse.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of watching movies during oral sex and a lengthy analysis of "A Bronx Tale," ending with a voicemail from Alec Baldwin yelling at his daughter.

A following segment began with the hosts discussing a phone call featuring a man yelling at his ex-wife, noting his fluctuating accent.  This transitioned to a discussion of scheduled guests Harvey Weinstein and possibly Mike Baker. The bulk of the segment focused on an intern's unusual behavior—dancing and singing a Dr. Pepper song in the hallway. The hosts joked about this, suggesting a "bullwhip" to his legs, and contrasted this with the intern's surprisingly cordial behavior and habit of telling the producer, Eric, "fuck you" when leaving.  Another intern, off his Adderall, was also mentioned.  A 21-year-old intern was then brought into the studio, leading to a conversation about his dating life, including a humorous recounting of a high school game called "Where's Your Junk," involving groping genitals in a dark locker room.  This included detailed descriptions of the game and similar incidents.  The conversation continued in a sexually charged manner, often referencing the intern's appearance, and included discussion of MC Hammer's video, "Pumps and a Bump," noting Hammer's apparent erection.

The next segment started with a discussion of Rob Zombie's music and potential tattoos, moving to excessive Twitter use, including tweeting while driving, and public service announcements depicting graphic consequences of texting and driving.  The conversation shifted to Jerry Sandusky's interview with Bob Costas, focusing on edited portions seemingly admitting guilt,  criticizing NBC's editing and Sandusky's lack of media training. The hosts also analyzed the hacked Twitter account of Whitney Cummings, confirming the racist tweets weren't hers.  Caller interaction followed, addressing listener opinions on NBC and MSNBC's handling of interviews, including an alleged edit of a Mitt Romney interview. This transitioned to a discussion of workplace bathroom hygiene, featuring graphic anecdotes. The segment concluded with a discussion of Rodney King's death, speculation about the circumstances, workplace soup options, and a brief analysis of a Master Poe martial arts video.

A segment began with a 911 call from a woman whose companion had drowned in their pool.  The hosts discussed the woman's panic and inaction.  Following the call, the show moved to "The Masked Magician," mocking its illusions, including the "disappearing dump truck" and Chris Angel's "walking on water" trick.  Harvey Weinstein then joined the show in-studio to discuss his new French-language film, *The Untouchables*,  covering its production, potential American remake, past experiences at Miramax (including disputes with Disney over *Fahrenheit 9/11* and *Lord of the Rings*), and his approach to film production.

The next segment continued the Harvey Weinstein interview, beginning with anecdotes about Howard Hughes. Weinstein discussed his career, his opinions on good and bad movies, his work on *Django Unchained*, and his relationship with Tarantino and Miramax.  The conversation then shifted to *The Untouchables* and *Comedian* (starring Jerry Seinfeld).  Weinstein's departure initiated a series of graphic and humorous anecdotes from the hosts and guest Danny Ross about defecation in various locations.  The discussion continued with caller contributions, brief mention of Opie's absence and potential health issues related to defecation, a text message from Chris Tucker's management about a business deal, and a segment where a host encouraged a caller to text while driving then expressed concern for their safety.

The final segment focused on the hosts and a caller, Eric, and their bowel habits.  The conversation centered on Eric's frequent need to defecate in unconventional places, attributed to his diet (greasy food, no gluten-free diet), lack of sleep, and comparisons to Roland.  Humorous moments included Eric's highway bowel movement, an Epsom salts incident, and the teased existence of surveillance footage. The discussion touched briefly on health consequences but primarily focused on the humorous aspects. The show concluded with a promotion of their Facebook page and upcoming schedule, noting Opie's potential absence.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice kill.  How did I see it?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're trying to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What are we, day three?  Yeah.  Opi-less for three days.  But fear not.  You've got the lovely, talented Jim Norton.  You might also know him as Chip Jefferson.  Oh, boy. 
[00:02:00]  Of course, Uncle Paul Hargis.  Sure.  All of all the wacky characters will be here today.  Although none of them will be here today.  Oh.  I'm stepping in.  Oh, no.  I like the characters that are good for one day.  Yeah, there are some.  One day characters.  It's like, what's your name?  I have Mike.  Who's Mike?  He won't be here tomorrow.  It's just a name.  Like Jerry Shepardini.  I just can't get going.  I just like, the name is so horrible. 
[00:02:30]  And it bothers Bob Kelly so much.  Jerry Shepardini?  Jerry Shepardini.  He goes, it's just fun to say.  I'm like, I know it is.  Yeah, he doesn't like it.  He hates it.  Well, good morning.  I guess we're, ooh, we in for a little bit of a broiler here in the northeast today.  97 degrees.  Oh, fuck, man.  With heat indexes, which I don't know how the fuck they figure out.  It has something to do with humidity.  Into like a 105. 
[00:03:00]  So there's a big heat alert for the city and the northeast, I believe.  I hope the news tells us what to do, because I'm never quite sure what to do in the heat.  In the heat, right.  Go home.  What do you do?  Turn the heat on?  Immediately, yeah.  And I'll wrap myself in a blanket.  And lay outside.  I'll open the oven and I'll lay next to it.  And I'll go, why do I not feel comfortable?  It is one of the big stories on the news.  They love when there's weather extremes, so they can just make you feel like an idiot for watching them. 
[00:03:30]  And just remember, if you're thirsty, just leave it alone.  Yeah, don't drink a lot of fluids.  No, never.  Fluids.  Fluids.  Don't drink a lot of fluids.  No.  And, yeah, just stay out in the heat as long as possible with no sunscreen.  Does that actually help anybody?  Does anybody really go, oh, fuck, that's right.  No one.  Very helpful.  Sitting there with a dry throat going, I don't know what the problem is.  It's instinctual.  As a human animal, if you're in the heat, you know what to do. 
[00:04:00]  You don't want to be in it.  It's uncomfortable.  So you just, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So you just, you fix it.  You get out of the heat.  You drink water.  What on a sunny day is more pleasant than a cup of ice water?  Right.  And aren't you looking for it in the heat?  Yeah.  You don't have to be told.  I love a cup of ice water.  It really does rule.  And the fact that they say if you're thirsty, just make sure you drink something. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  It's just wasted words.  It's just noise.  Yeah.  They're just making fucking noise with their mouths.  And I guess the elderly, once you get old, regardless if you're dementia or Alzheimer's or whatnot, you just kind of forget that you're supposed to do certain things like drink water and turn on the air conditioner.  Because apparently, from what I hear on the news, the elderly, just blithering idiots in the heat.  They really are.  They just don't drink water and they don't turn on the AC and they just drop dead.  So you have to constantly check on them in this hot weather. 
[00:05:00]  Please check the elderly.  There's a 90-year-old woman watching the news and they're like, drink lots of water.  And she's like, oh.  And she pulls her own shoe out of her mouth.  That would explain.  I remembered it was something.  But I didn't know it was water.  Sitting in front of the radiator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They turn the heat up.  I best turn the heat up so it doesn't seem so hot when I go outside.  There's some elderly logic to it with earmuffs on, but dunce. 
[00:05:30]  If I balance it out.  Yes.  If it feels hot indoors, it won't feel so hot out of doors.  Out of doors.  I'm watching my stories in the blazing heat and I can't feel the left side of my body.  Old people can really smell.  When I was, I guess I was 13 or whatever, or 12, I got, maybe 11 actually, or 12.  I got, with my friends, I got arrested because they were smoking pot. 
[00:06:00]  And I didn't smoke pot at the time, but I was in the car and I got sentenced to community  service for two weeks.  Wow.  And I had to do it in an old age home.  It was on, I think, Remsen Avenue in New Brunswick, like the Jack something houses,  but it was old people.  Jack Torrance houses?  Yeah, I wish.  Go out and look at the fucking shrubs, Edna.  And just kill her with an ax.  And he was just helping out, clean the place and get the floors clean and all that nonsense  for a few hours a day for two weeks. 
[00:06:30]  But man, the old people, wow.  There was a couple of them that smelled, and I had never smelled anybody down the hall.  Wow.  There was such a body odor.  It was like a thick body rot that you could smell on somebody.  Like, you could smell, again, down a full hallway.  I remember never realizing you could smell somebody from that far away.  That's astounding.  And what is it?  Is it rot?  It's like an old dog also. 
[00:07:00]  There's nothing you can do.  They just fucking smell like an old, mangy fucking dog.  And old people get the same thing.  It's awful, man.  They just stench.  I guess it's probably harder to bathe and shit like that.  I can't slip in the bathtub.  I need one of those bathtubs I see on the television with the little door that I could step in.  One of those.  These are the best years of my life, are they?  Yeah, perish the thought you're 20s or 30s again. 
[00:07:30]  I won one of those life call things.  I said, that's for some old person.  Then I fell down the stairs and broke my hip.  Yeah.  Because you're an old person, you dummy.  I hate that commercial.  This old broad.  My daughter told me to get one of these life calls.  That's for one of those old people.  Like you.  You're a fucking pretzel stick boned motherfucker.  You ever see that?  The bathtubs with the door on it?  No.  I guess it's like a watertight door like on a ship or something. 
[00:08:00]  So you could open a door and then they step in, close it, and then fill it up with water like a bathtub.  I guess you can't open the door if it's full of water.  It's like the water pressure.  They're like literally stepping into it.  I see.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  They walk right in.  It kind of seems cool if you're lazy too.  Is it like a standing shower or is it different?  But they could sit down and it's like a tub.  It's a tub, but there's a door on it.  It's astounding. 
[00:08:30]  Poor old people.  I know.  But they really are catering to the old folk.  Well, that's kind of a shower thing.  That isn't meant to fill up with water like a bathtub.  These are literally bathtubs with doors in the side.  And yeah, old people, they're coming up with a lot of gadgetry for them.  They're all living so much longer.  It's like a new market that's never been tapped.  Yes, it is a new market.  These hover rounds and fucking bathtubs.  There it is with the doors on them.  And there's a brightness thing on the front one here. 
[00:09:00]  Feel like you're in your 120s for really old people in a few years.  Yeah, I'm sure the best years of your life, you like having to have a door on your bathtub  instead of hopping over it like you're getting into a convertible with a nice broad inside the tub with you.  Poor old people.  Old people.  They need that fucking thing on the side of the stairs where they sit down and it goes up at .00001 mile an hour.  It takes forever to get up the stairs.  My ex-ex-girlfriend loved old people. 
[00:09:30]  Loved old people.  Is it a caring thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She had real affection.  And then my most recent ex-girlfriend, if she could put them all in a pile and set them on fire,  I would have gladly done so.  Hated their guts.  But my ex-ex loved fucking old people, man.  She had such an affection and found them interesting and funny and charming.  She just dug old people.  You know what the fucking quandary is with them?  They have so much life experience and probably have interesting experiences that happen to them, 
[00:10:00]  but they can't convey them without boring the living fuck out of you.  Absolutely.  You have to sit through hours with them before you get that little colonel.  Whoa!  You know who?  You worked on the Manhattan Project?  Why wouldn't you have told me that in the beginning?  Yeah, why didn't you fucking tell me about your hat?  Exactly.  And what happened to your derby?  Why would you have to talk about peanut brittle for three hours?  I think my grandfather was well into his 70s before I found out that he burnt down a movie studio in Brooklyn. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Fantastic, right?  Why wouldn't that be story one?  Exactly.  Story numero uno.  And then you might sit through the crappy fucking, you know, story about how he couldn't afford shoes.  You need to set a precedent that you are interesting before I sit down with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Open big.  I'd love to hear about how much this cost when you were a certain age.  Wonderful.  But how about you get to the racial beatings first, Pop-Pop?  I'd love to hear about that.  Yes.  The racial beatings.  I want to hear about the first time you sodomized Nana in an Edsel. 
[00:11:00]  You're right.  They never go with the good stories first.  Good stories first.  So it's a bore fest.  And you sit there, you've got to look fucking interested.  And they just go on and on.  With some of this equipment, did you hear the, we were talking about the posty vac,  which is that vacuum pump for your non-working noodle dick.  You put it on there, you pump it up, and then you put a rubber ring around the base of your dick,  and you're able to have sex without taking those pesky blue pills, is how they say it in the commercial. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that work.  Pesky blue pills that make your cock work with nothing but a swallow of a pill.  Who needs to swallow an inconvenient pill when you can hook up a vacuum to your dick  and slip an O-ring around it like it's a space shuttle?  Why would you want to just take a pill that keeps your cock hard for hours when you can do this?  Yeah, yeah, why?  Pesky blue pill.  Pesky blue pill, really?  Gulp. 
[00:12:00]  There, done.  Turgid.  Yeah, that was, that was uncomfortable.  Yeah.  But no, you'd rather pump it up.  Well, apparently a little scandal involving the posty vac insurance fraud.  They keep saying how insurance pays for it, Medicare will pay for it, and I guess the government  has pumped a shitload, pumped a shitload of money into the posty vac and paying for it  for people.  And the posty vac people have been submitting claims with erroneous information, probably 
[00:12:30]  not real patients just to get the government kickback money.  Yeah, who would think a cock pump company wouldn't be on the up and up when it comes  to their finances?  So to speak.  So to speak.  But that's just another one of these things, like you said, with the old people and they're  living longer and you've got to cater to them.  Well, plus they're suckers, too.  Ah, sucker.  You could just, you could get them to buy whatever.  Yeah.  Like, oh, this will make your life safer. 
[00:13:00]  It is amazing.  When I found out how much money in fraud they'd made, I was like, well, wow, that's a lot  of posty vacs.  How much was it?  It's like hundreds of thousands of posty vacs.  Wow.  People are up there.  People are buying this shit.  If you can't get a rod, you know, if you could get a rod, you watch the posty vac commercial  and you'll laugh your ass off.  It's stupid.  If you're sitting there with fucking, you know, a piece of limp fucking roast beef hanging  in from your zipper, you're probably thinking, I might, I might get that. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, but it seems so much more pesky than just taking that little pill.  It does seem pesky to have to slide that over your dick and start pumping like a flat,  little flat tire.  Well, it's good for people who have heart problems because they can't take Viagra.  There's a lot of people who have health issues that Viagra is bad for and Cialis.  I think they say if you're like taking heart medication, you should, there's something  that you shouldn't take with it.  So that's probably what it is.  Probably.  So you got to sit there and pump your dick up.  Yeah.  Pump your dick up.  Oh, that would be a funny song parody. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Posty vac.  Pump my dick up.  Pump my dick up.  By the way, you just had, just right there was enough for us to do a song parody.  That's all the lyrics of the song.  That's all you need.  So we're going to just do it.  Auto tune it.  Yeah.  It's done.  Sure, Drew Boogie will put that together.  Anthony, pump my dick up.  Pump my dick up.  Posty vac.  Why is the posty vac?  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Pump my dick up.  All right.  Posty vac.  Ugh.  I'm always angry in those songs.  You really are. 
[00:14:30]  I still think you should talk lyrically.  That's right.  Make it easier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just speak lyrically.  I'm always angry because I'm always angry.  Yeah.  It's just painting you accurately.  Probably.  I'm being told it sucks the dick up.  It doesn't pump the dick up.  Look.  They don't call it a penis suck.  They call it a penis pump.  Yeah.  Because you're pumping your dick up.  I really want to try one.  I guarantee it's going to feel awful.  I won't like it.  Really?  Yeah.  I won't like it.  Aren't those typically masturbation machines like the dick pump?  They were always posed in the back of those magazines as a penis enlarger. 
[00:15:00]  Like you'd sit there and if you pump your dick every day, it would kind of stretch it  out and make it bigger.  It's a jacking off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's this for?  A jacking off?  But I don't know.  It seems like it's a beat off machine.  I don't know if it's the same thing.  I wonder.  Does the air get sucked out of the thing?  Is that how it works?  Like it sucks all the air out and then pulls your dick.  Because they have those, like a lot of guys send me these videos.  Like they know that I like big pussies and clits. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  So they send me these really puffy clits.  Yeah.  But they've been vacuum pumped, which don't turn me on.  No.  They take a big thing.  It looks like a respirator mask.  Yeah.  To your face.  An apnea mask.  Yeah.  An apnea mask.  And they shove it over the vagina and then they suck the air out and it kind of pulls it.  It's like you ever take those, you know those balloons that you make balloon  animals with?  Sure.  And then the little tail at the top.  If you put that in your mouth and suck the air out, it's going to get bigger.  That's the same principle.  Oh yeah.  That's a, oh God.  That's disgusting.  It just doesn't do it for me because it's not naturally fat. 
[00:16:00]  I mean.  It looks like it was in the fucking ring with Tyson back in the 90s.  Yeah.  It's all flubby.  Yeah.  It looks like a big fucking swollen eyeball.  That does nothing for me.  I don't think it's supposed to be more for you.  It's supposed to be for her.  Really?  The guys that send me those videos.  For her pleasure.  Because they know I like big pussies.  I'll get those all the time.  I'm like, no, that's not what I like.  I like a naturally big vagina.  Not one that's been pumped.  God's gift.  God's gift.  Not a pumped up fucking fake puss.  I don't like mechanisms and things like that. 
[00:16:30]  Like when you see that mask thing on her pumping it up with a machine.  Like all that shit.  Latex stuff.  You ever see that kinky shit where the guy's laying in this bed of latex?  And he wears, he puts like a straw in his mouth and they suck every bit of air out.  And he's trapped in a latex sandwich, unable to move.  And the broad like fucking smacks his cock and shit and tweaks him.  But he can't move. 
[00:17:00]  How the fuck is that not the most horrifying thing?  Mummification.  And claustrophobic.  Yeah, mummification.  Can you breathe in it?  Yeah.  You breathe through a straw.  But what if they put their thumb over the straw?  They do a breath control.  Oh my god.  That's frightening.  I don't like that at all.  I'd love to interview a dominatrix about that because I am fascinated with it.  I can't comprehend how anybody could get off on that.  But guys love it.  No.  They want to be wrapped up in either saran wrap or fucking plastic. 
[00:17:30]  There was one story I read a couple years ago.  I had claustrophobic even thinking about it.  It was like two guys met on the internet.  And it was like they were thinking about charging the guy with murder.  We might have even talked about it here.  And they were into like this mummification stuff.  And the one guy was mummified and he put the other guy in his closet.  And the guy suffocated the middle of the night.  Oh, man.  Just left him there all night in his closet.  Oh, imagine how hard he was trying to breathe.  Oh, fuck, dude.  Oh, I can't take that.  I don't get that.  Do you think he was turned on like even as he was dying? 
[00:18:00]  No.  Oh, yeah.  He's just like, this is great.  I can't breathe, but fuck.  He's just pumping load after load out into his plastic bag clothes.  Terrible.  Yeah, there has to be a moment where you're like, this is just not cool.  I'm dying.  Oh, God.  I need to be able to breathe.  Do you know the woman we interviewed, Jade Vixen, Asian girl who was kidnapped by the fucking  and her sub, she had, I believe it was another boyfriend after that die who was practicing 
[00:18:30]  mummification on him.  Jeez, man.  What the fuck?  Maybe we can look that up.  Jade Vixen boyfriend.  And not the sub that took her hostage and then shot himself.  But after that, I think it was a guy she was dating.  What a wacky lifestyle.  Who fucking suffocated.  He was wearing like rubber goods or something.  I try not to involve myself in anything sexually that could kill you.  Yeah.  You know, that autoerotic asphyxiation, shit like that. 
[00:19:00]  I really don't get that.  I don't even get the choking thing.  I know people do.  I know chicks dig it and shit like that.  Sometimes they lean on their fucking throat with that.  But why is that, is it, is it a rape fantasy thing?  Total submissive.  I've had it in my life lightly.  Like I'm not big on my neck being fucked with.  But I've had my neck squeezed and I can, I can get into it.  But it's not a fetish for me.  Just in the moment it can be hot.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Her real name is Edith Ma, M-A-A.  Wow. 
[00:19:30]  What a weird name.  That's not quite as sexy.  Edith.  Whose lawyer boyfriend was shot and killed three years ago by a crazed client.  Just found her newest beau dead in the attic.  Okay.  Man, the black widow here.  She's a former PhD student turned S&M model, better known as you had Vixen Wright.  Made the horrific discovery, I guess it was last year or a couple years ago.  He's an engineer who's based, based on online photos, seemed to share her kinky interests.  He was testing new scuba equipment when he died, according to a police report.  Scuba equipment? 
[00:20:00]  No foul play is suspected.  He was a heavy rubber fetishist, said a source close to the couple, who said Ma, a new New  York native, specialized in oxygen deprivation.  Holy shit.  She could not be reached for comment.  Wow.  I wonder if she, because she was a cool girl when she was in, we should talk to Lainey and  see if we can get her in or on the phone, but I would love to, unless she won't talk about  it.  Yeah, yeah.  Only to talk about this shit.  Yeah.  I would love to talk about this rubber good shit.  I don't get the attraction to what guys get all, like, what do you, do you jerk a guy 
[00:20:30]  off while he's like that?  Does he?  Yeah, and he's like fucking trying to breathe.  But was she, now she wasn't involved with that?  She just found him dead, I guess.  Found him.  She's a, she's an oxygen deprivation specialist.  And he died of oxygen deprivation.  And he's a rubber good, wow, when is that Tyson clip from?  Sorry.  Oh.  That's now?  Spike Lee to direct Mike Tyson's Broadway debut.  Do we try to get him in, we just can't get him in?  He's not doing-  He's not up here at all, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I would love to talk to him. 
[00:21:00]  That's the clip, I think, that's going around.  He was on the Today Show yesterday.  Oh, yesterday.  Because, yeah, he's doing, you know, he did, he started doing a one-man show, Tyson.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, he started, he's just about his life.  And is he doing that on Broadway?  Yeah, and now he's coming to Broadway with it.  I think he's just doing, like, a week or something, though.  And Spike Lee?  In August.  In August, he's doing it.  Him and fucking Spike.  I would love to talk to Mike Tyson, man.  Spike Lee's directing it.  Win me a Tony Award.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um.  Holy shit.  Oh, okay, sorry, that's a clip for me.  They're showing it on Imus.  He sure still looks fucking dangerous. 
[00:21:30]  But look at that.  Why do they take up so much?  I don't need Today exclusive.  It's half the screen now.  It's half the screen.  What the fuck are they doing?  Is taken up with fucking drivel graphics.  Holy mackerel.  That's insane.  That's what Spike Lee-  Spike Lee just looks weird.  He's looking funny these days.  Yeah.  Well, I love Spike.  Even though Spike Lee is, like, really kind of radical and he irritates people, I just  kind of love him.  He really is irritating.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:22:00]  Tyson said he was inspired by Chaz Palminteri doing a Bronx tale.  Oh, by himself.  A Bronx tale.  And then Tyson was like, oh, I got to get involved in this.  I'm inspired by Rich Voss' appearance with a Bronx tale.  Oh, God.  Wow, he is a fucking devastating-looking motherfucker.  He's talking about prostitutes there.  Yeah, he's probably talking about rape.  He's just having fun.  He's laughing.  You want to hear the clip?  Yeah, it's just going to make me love Tyson. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I just love Mike Tyson.  I just want to hang out with him.  He is great.  The times I've met him, he's been great, man.  Yeah.  There may be, I think I told you that, there may be video of he and I kissing the same  girl in Vegas.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Wink, wink.  Wink, wink, girl.  Not at the same time.  No.  Tyson, do you think he's into that?  I don't know.  Or into anything?  I don't know if he knew because it was public in front of a lot of people.  How do you not know?  Oh, with vanity, it's hard not to.  I saw that picture of vanity.  I would know. 
[00:23:00]  You might not in that moment, that crazy moment at the porn convention on the expo floor.  Yeah.  You might not, dude.  I don't know.  Now you might.  I see.  But, um.  Oh, come on.  That looks like one of those trannies.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Right, exactly.  Wait a minute.  Big cock pic.  Wait a minute.  Her eyes?  No, but when you see her face, you see her interact, you could, if you're not looking  for it, if you're not thinking, if you just, like.  I'm always looking for it.  Ha, ha, ha.  Let me see.  That's the kind of, is that, is that, ah, there's something, well, I know now.  Don't forget you also know.  Now I know. 
[00:23:30]  And she's 40, I think.  At least she's not that old, but she's in her late 30s.  She's not, like, young anymore.  What a thick body.  Yeah.  That's a manly chest.  Wow.  Look at the picture down there.  Like, you might be able to tell with some of these, but she's one of the more passable.  But anyway, I, you know, a lot of people didn't know.  Yeah, that's a man face right there.  You think?  Looks like if Kim Kardashian's brother had a brother and fucking dressed up like a woman.  I'm going to turn in on the transsexuals.  I don't think so.  I'm going to. 
[00:24:00]  You know what?  I don't think so.  I'm going to try.  Or I'll die trying.  Look, I can appreciate ones that, you know, look the part.  It's not all that crazy to say, all right, that looks like a woman.  But that really doesn't.  And they usually always have some little tinge of manliness in their face.  Oh, no, no, no, I agree.  And the voice is fine with Bailey. 
[00:24:30]  It's not this crazy.  But there's just something there.  And I know you can't really be objective when you know.  I had lunch with her and her husband last week.  How did that go?  Fine.  We just met for lunch.  It was literally just the three of us sat down and just bullshitted.  We just all eat sausage without chewing.  Slide it down.  I like pelicans.  There's all he is at the table doing that, just getting looks from the other tables. 
[00:25:00]  Laughing.  Oh, that's funny.  We didn't do that, but I wish we had.  Well, that face is kind of feminine.  She said she's had no work done whatsoever.  Who is that?  Who is that one?  Trying to find a...  That kind of looks like a chick.  Good ones.  Blonde.  It might be Photoshopped, too.  It could be. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Wow, that's some Facebook magic right there where she's looking up at the camera.  That elevated view.  What does that fucking view do to girls?  I don't know, man.  When the camera is up high and they're looking up, it makes their eyes...  What wonderful website is this?  Wow, there's some fucking attractive ones on this site.  Oh.  Come on, that wasn't one. 
[00:26:00]  Go back.  That?  That's a dude?  I think you might be surprised.  What the fuck?  Oh.  Holy shit.  All right, their faces are kind of looking very girly-like.  Someone's changing their tune quicker than I expected them to.  Well, yeah, I'm sounding a little too excited here.  I didn't expect my victory to be so...  I'm just extremely surprised at the amount of trannies that have girly faces.  Yeah.  It's so fucked up.  A lot of them, dude.  All right, that's a dude. 
[00:26:30]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  It's like my Uncle Joe.  It's like Sebastian Bach.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  Hey, I'll find some awful ones.  How'd that make the site?  What site is this?  Let's give them a plug.  Best-she-mails-ever.tumblr.com.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  It's amazing how many websites I don't know about.  Yeah, right?  Well, Danny seems to have found one that has a lot of ones that kind of look like...  I don't fuck around when I come to my she-mails. 
[00:27:00]  No.  Yeah, that one on the left, you can tell.  There's one there that's got kind of...  I wish I had her pecs.  What a little dick.  Oh, God.  He was a made-up one.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's very funny, but that's how you know Anthony's about to take the plunge, because he went,  ugh, what a little dick.  Yeah.  What do I want?  A nice fucking plump one on these she-mails?  What the fuck?  Anthony's a fucking size queen.  Come on, you piece of shit.  So I turned in one fucking minute from being like, ugh, to a size queen.  I don't think so.  Oh, come on.  Look at her cheekbones.  Where's the cock, for Pete's sake? 
[00:27:30]  Wow, all right.  That was the fastest fucking about-face I've ever seen.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What were we just talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  What did we start talking about?  Tyson?  Oh, Tyson, but before then.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, we talked about Vanley.  Okay.  And what before then?  How about before then?  We said good morning.  No, I didn't.  Penis pumps.  Penis pumps.  Yeah, the Plastivac.  Old people.  The Plastivac.  Stupid old people.  And, uh, yeah, how they smell.  Ugh.  I found a fucking chick online who I thought of, Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  She's, uh, she had braces in a lot of her porn.  She's really- Michelle Lynn.  Did I ever show you her?  I don't think so.  You know who she is, Danny?  Michelle Lynn.  She's kind of, uh, hot.  Hang on.  And she does a lot of videos with braces.  I think she took them off, though.  Like, she's probably 25.  Yeah, her teeth are probably straight by now.  I mean, you'd hope not, though, because with braces, she was really sexy.  Was it?  Yeah, but I've thought of you so many times when I've seen her, I'm like, you would love  this fucking chick.  I'm not really big on the braces.  Oh, you're not?  No, no.  That's kind of crazy. 
[00:28:30]  Well, she's, you know.  Yeah.  She's fucking- she looks good with me.  I don't like braces either.  Yeah.  They don't do anything for me, but with her-  They're hot on the legs.  I like a good polio fuck.  Yeah, I really- I like- I like to rip them off like Forrest Gump's shoes when he runs  quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  That and fucking in an iron lung.  Some ancient diseases.  What was that movie about the, uh-  Yeah, she's a dirty little girl.  Kind of filthy.  She plays with her pussy, and she just- she jerks her boyfriend off through his pants. 
[00:29:00]  Really?  She doesn't do anything hardcore.  She makes tease videos.  That's adorable.  Yeah, she's kind of a cool- she's cool.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I might, uh- I might have to search out some videos.  Yeah, I think- I think you're gonna be back on the site Danny just had.  Yeah.  What was that?  No, I'm just curious again.  I'm bi-curious.  Well, that's, uh- that's a great site right there.  What, this one?  Yeah, yeah.  The, uh, the tranny, uh-  Tranny site. 
[00:29:30]  But they- they- you know, I'm just- I'll say it.  They- you know, they don't look bad.  I've seen ones that look a lot fucking worse on-  Sure.  I don't know the inter-tubes.  Sure.  It's amazing how much free porn you get.  Amazing.  It's kind of hard- it's kind of hard to pay for it.  Um, who pays for it?  That's-  I still do.  No way.  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't like to steal.  Jim.  It's not stealing when it's just on, you know, those- those tube sites.  How do they make money, though?  Like, I'd love to know in porn, how do they fucking make money anymore?  I don't even fucking know.  It's almost impossible. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  Most people don't want to put on their credit cards.  You married guys got to go out there and just find it for free.  And Bob Kelly, when he turned me on to that mega site, it's like, you don't need to go  anywhere else.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Clitty.com.  I mean, there's just-  Clitty.com?  There may be, there's probably still, like, a certain sect of people, like, guys that  have to go to adult bookstores and stuff like that because their wives don't want them watching  or they can't have it in their internet history or whatever it is.  I'll bet there is.  But what is- why does that make you pay for it instead of- 
[00:30:30]  Because you can't look at it on your computer because you're- you don't want to get caught.  I mean, but, like, pay sites.  Like, who's going to a pay internet site?  I don't know who would go to a pay site.  I could see buying physical DVDs.  Physical DVDs?  Ugh.  If you don't want to get caught.  It's crazy.  I haven't bought a DVD in a long time, man.  Like, a porn DVD?  I threw mine out recently.  It was really hard to do.  Aw.  But I threw out probably close to a thousand DVDs. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  You got to pay sites, though?  Maybe.  Occasionally, I'll buy on clipsforsale.com if there's one I want to see.  Like what?  I had thrown out-  You can't find it?  I'm not exaggerating when I see a thousand DVDs.  Like, Yoshi used to send them to me all the time for Evil Angel.  And, you know, again, I would watch a lot of them.  And I felt weird.  Like, I wanted to hoard them.  But it's like, no.  You don't need to.  Everything here is on-  You know what's hard for me to throw out with porn?  Some of my old videotapes that I know are kind of hard to get.  Like VHS?  Yeah, there's a few of them.  I just want to transfer them and get rid of them. 
[00:31:30]  Because there's no reason to have them.  You want to pawn these or sell them?  Or what are you looking to do with these pornos?  I don't just want to have viewing parties and charge people and hand out Kleenex.  Yeah, I don't-  I haven't used a DVD or shit in-  Especially with a porno.  It's like-  And with VCR, with a video, there was always a checklist.  A post-ejaculation checklist.  Because you'd get so disinterested with it after you came that sometimes you'd forget to take it out of the fucking VCR. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  You're just done.  It's like, okay, I'm done.  I don't want to think about the filth I just committed upon myself.  So you'd forget to take it out of the VCR.  And that could be awkward, depending on who's coming over.  So I think it's a lot easier to go online, even if you don't want your wife to see it,  than it is to take the chance of having physical porn in your house.  When the wives find that thing, ugh.  What is this?  You don't find me attractive? 
[00:32:30]  What does she have that I don't?  You don't.  You know?  I loved reading those fucking letters in the Q&A sections of magazines and whatnot when they're trying to ask somebody, like,  what does it mean if my husband gets porn?  I found a stockpile of pornography.  Does he not want me anymore?  Exactly.  Yeah.  You're like the actual meat and lubrication.  But he's thinking about other things.  Yeah, how about you join in and blow him while he's watching it? 
[00:33:00]  Or take part of it?  That's how women mess up.  It's like, guys are garbage, but we wouldn't mind sharing most of the perversion with you.  Like, one woman told me her husband was jerking off, and he's a buddy of mine.  She's like, he's jerking off, and he won't let me do it with him or play with him while he does it.  Like, he's watching porn, and she gets so mad at him.  But I'm like, that's because he's watching something he doesn't want you to know about.  Yeah.  And I wasn't ratting on him.  I'm like, so just be dirty and tell him it's okay whatever he's jerking off to.  I'm going to hopefully it's not something terrible. 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  And fucking just join in.  You ever have a situation where you're just sitting back and you're going, this is fantastic, and this girl is great?  One time, I had a nice cold drink in my hand watching the Yankees in the World Series on television, of course.  I wasn't at the park.  While getting a blowjob.  And I'm just watching the game.  From Billy Martin. 
[00:34:00]  Just watching the game, getting a blowjob.  And sometimes it just makes you go like, now this is like the best thing.  Yeah.  It's got all the features.  One of my friends, the morning of my wedding, we went out to lunch or something, and he made the announcement that this may be the greatest day of his life.  Because this morning, he was watching Harry Potter, and he started getting blown at the same time.  Oh, okay.  That's a little weird.  It's like Harry Potter, and he's like, yeah.  I got blown to Tales from the Crypt once.  That's a good one.  Tales from the Crypt.  I got blown to Wrath of Khan. 
[00:34:30]  Which is kind of cool.  But I had to hold back because I wanted to watch the episode.  I was so into it.  Right.  I couldn't release until it was over.  You've got to be careful.  You don't completely lose interest.  Take that blowjob for granted and start really getting into the story, and she's going to feel it maybe, you know.  It was the Santa Claus story.  That one's great.  That's so good.  Yeah.  I could go on a fire poker to the head.  I think.  Is that the one?  It was where the guy from, I think the guy from Night Court played.  Oh, oh, that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was like outside, or it was one of those the calls coming from the inside sort of situation. 
[00:35:00]  The crazy Santa Claus came to the door.  And didn't the kid open up the door?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Santa's here.  The problem is you remember more details about the episode than you do about the blowjob.  About the blowjob.  Yeah, that was a classic episode.  I understand.  But what are you going to remember?  Yeah, and then she went down the side of it.  Then she was sucking my balls.  I got blown once to the woodsman.  I don't know what was sexier.  The woodsman.  I couldn't concentrate, man.  I can only do one thing at a time. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Nah, I can't get my dick sucked and watch TV at the same time.  I kind of like having it.  Well, it's Oz.  Oz, some fucking dicks.  I like having the TV on.  Some type of, because it's kind of a weird light.  I like having a weird light on in the room like that.  And then a little bit of sound so you don't just kind of feel like you're making dumb noises.  So I kind of do like that.  But you can't really pay attention to the movie.  Yeah.  Although there have been times I've been known to move my head like I'm trying to make a sexy move. 
[00:36:00]  But it's just to catch a cool part in the movie.  Maybe that's on.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That happens.  So you don't get thrown off by any of the weird voices in the movies that you don't expect?  Yeah.  It's happened before.  I have gotten thrown off.  I've paid a little too much attention to the movie.  And performance was lackluster.  TV is terrible.  Because like if you, like, I always have either like history or discovery channel on my house.  So it's like you don't really want to get stuff going on.  And then Pawn Stars comes on.  You know, because then you start hearing what these people are bringing in. 
[00:36:30]  And you're like, hmm?  What?  Yeah.  An 18th century would?  I bet he's going to offer 800 bucks.  Anthony getting blown and he just hears Edward Norton yelling at somebody to bite the curb.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that would be.  And he comes immediately.  Yes.  With his pants.  Much harder.  And she's taking it out.  He's giving him that fucking, the kite speech and fucking Elliot Gould.  Not welcome.  Yeah, you see what this, you know what this means? 
[00:37:00]  Not welcome.  Oh, well.  Or did he cock block his mother?  What did he say?  You think I'm going to let some Jew fuck my mother?  Some kike?  Oh, he's using that.  Yeah.  Shylock nose or something like that?  Cut off your Shylock nose and shove it up your fucking ass.  Wow.  Yeah, he was great in that.  What an uncomfortable dinner that was.  He's shoving the meat in his vegetarian sister's mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eat it.  Fucking eat it.  At dinner?  Yeah.  Yeah, that started like the real going downhill. 
[00:37:30]  Then he went to jail.  Yeah.  And got fucked in the ass.  Oh, yeah, he did.  That was a great fucking...  I just didn't like that part of it, like...  I didn't either.  I'll tell you why.  Because they had to PC it up in a way for Hollywood.  Like, oh, look, the white supremacist gets his comeuppance.  Yeah, by the white guys.  And he gets fucked in the...  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's like, did you have to go that way with this?  Couldn't he find redemption some other way?  He made friends with the black guy who wound up saving his life in the prison. 
[00:38:00]  And the white guys turned on him, and the white guys fucked him in the ass.  I don't know.  I don't see that.  That's a bizarro prison.  The best fucking look is Edward Norton glaring at Elliot Gould as he talks.  Oh, when Elliot Gould asked him a question, like, do you really think that's the way things should be?  He asked him something, and Edward Norton looked up at him and kind of made a...  It was something about the Rodney King thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you think he deserves something?  He deserves it, and it's like, eh?  And he's looking like...  Be careful. 
[00:38:30]  That made Elliot Gould go, like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He was so good in this.  I really...  This was one of Edward Norton's best roles as far as his acting goes, I do believe.  ...against white people, too.  They're not offing each other in record numbers all over America.  Look at the statistics, for Christ's sakes.  It's one...  Hold on, Dave.  Turn Anthony's mic off.  I want to hear the movie.  Yeah.  Not only that, they're proud. 
[00:39:00]  God, I love her.  Feruza.  Who is she?  Feruza Balk.  You're like, Feruza Balk.  Oh, my God, I love her.  You might want to take a look at the social inequalities that produce them.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  That's exactly what I hate, because what you're doing, Davina, is taking one thing,  and calling it something else, and just, you know, alleviating the responsibility that  these people have to do.  Exactly.  Oh, what?  You know, it's like saying, it's not a riot.  It's rage.  I feel like that Ant can watch this movie, and Edward Norton would be like, well, that  part's okay.  He's right there.  I will say one thing they did in this that I like, is they made the dialogue, like, 
[00:39:30]  they gave him good arguments.  Like, he wasn't just an irrational asshole.  Like, when you watch this, you go, well, that's a great point that he's making.  They kind of give him some kind of a fucking...  Yes.  A humanity that makes sense.  He's not just a total...  You can understand why an intelligent person would fall into it.  Yeah, absolutely.  And he attacks them.  He attacked police officers.  That's the bottom line.  And he walked.  Yeah, and there's some Yahoo there with a video camera who turned it on halfway through,  so that all we see is them hitting him.  Exactly.  You know, you got Powell and Kuhn winding up and cracking him with billy gloves, and Bersenio 
[00:40:00]  kicking him in the back of the skull, so it looks severe, you know?  And people are going, oh, this poor guy.  Ah, and they show the little brother being influenced.  Yeah, it's trotting the home.  On the stand, defending themselves for using absolutely standard textbook self-defense procedures.  Where have I heard that before?  It's so...  All we need to do is have fucking Bobo interrupt this fucking dinner with a phone call.  We have the show.  I didn't say it was excessive, but I think it was totally appropriate. 
[00:40:30]  I think they're in a better position to make that judgment call than you are.  In fact, we as society grant cops a certain amount of authority.  It's totally...  Knowledge to get their job is difficult and dangerous.  Yeah.  You know, unfortunately, very few people, like, respect that and respect that authority.  Look who's talking about respect here, Mr. Junior KKK.  What?  You know what?  You want to go to college, Davina?  You should learn to listen.  Derek.  Okay, and say it.  Derek.  I acknowledge a cop's authority. 
[00:41:00]  I don't respect any laws that let monkeys like Rodney King back on the...  That's where the dinner turns a little.  Yeah.  Disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.  Please.  So take your head out of your ass.  You've gotten off the point.  This girlfriend's cracking up at us.  I had a point.  He's hilarious.  Do you have one?  What is your point, Derek?  All right.  Think about this.  Think about this.  If Danny had been walking across the street that night and Rodney King had plowed into...  Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?  Dropped him in the pool.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Elliot Gould.  Why would she bring him home for dinner?  I know.  Bad idea.  I would like some dessert.  Oh, look at her trying to just keep the dinner together.  I would like some dessert.  I would like to just...  Oh, what do you want?  The swastika cookies?  Yes.  Before my skinhead son hits my Jewish boyfriend and my liberal cunt daughter, I would like  to have a little dessert, dessert, dessert.  Just trying to hold things together.  What the fuck?  She knows the son's got a giant swastika tattoo on his chest, yet she brings home a Jewish 
[00:42:00]  guy.  That was a terrible decision.  Very bad decision on part of mom.  But then again, when you look, she's still smoking with bloody fucking cough lungs.  That's Beverly D'Angelo, right?  Yeah.  What a set of tits on her.  She was lovely, right?  Yeah.  She wasn't afraid to do topless back in the day, too.  And she had ample melons.  Very, very full breast disease.  And Feruza, yeah.  Feruza's weird.  Jesus, look at that fucking fifth picture.  What a giant mouth. 
[00:42:30]  She has that big fucking mouth and those wacky teeth.  Danny, top one, five people in.  Look at the fucking choppers on her.  Holy shit.  All right.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Let me see that.  Giant mouth.  That's not her real gums.  That's got to be her fucking goof.  No, that's really her.  What giant fucking gums.  She's known for that.  That's too big.  She's kind of known for that.  She's got pretty lips, but her fucking gums are massive.  When she smiles like that, it's terrible.  But I think when she just puts on regular mouth, she don't look too bad. 
[00:43:00]  I would never, ever tell jokes around her.  You know, just horrible, depressing stories.  Like every time she's like, guess what happened to me today?  I'd be like, hold on.  I just read that a baby died.  Yeah, you know.  I would never want to see her happy.  She probably doesn't look very good now, right?  How old is she?  Oh, man.  That's a pretty good shot.  I know who she is because of that movie, but I don't know her name.  She's on the convention circuit now.  Oh, is that what she's doing?  So we could probably meet her at Comical Con.  Oh, maybe.  That's right. 
[00:43:30]  She's very gothy looking in the old days.  She's probably married, though.  What does that matter?  That's close.  Like you don't have a shot?  Oh, that was last year?  She looks good.  How old is she, like 34?  Why am I now obsessed with her bio?  Is she a cancer?  Capricorn?  Born in, let's see, 74.  Wow, she's older than that.  Wow.  Yeah, okay.  38?  38?  Yeah.  Okay, she's hot as fuck.  You still found that?  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Well, for the story, too.  I'd fuck her. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I got a full rod right now.  I never really read any stories about her fucking or scandals or anything with her.  If she seems the type that would have that, you know, then she doesn't.  It's not bad.  Alec Baldwin is my favorite person alive.  Yes.  Oh.  I really, I know he's an obnoxious prick, but I fucking love this dude.  He's a tough guy.  I find him hypocritical, too, many times.  Okay.  But, yeah, how could you not just enjoy him as a person, as a miserable yelling man, just 
[00:44:30]  hatred in his heart?  He fucking just can't get enough of screaming.  And these photographers are fucking cocksucked.  They're the same ones that blocked you that day.  Like, that's these paparazzi pieces of shit, and he just hates them, and he can't hide it.  What a great shot.  It shows Alec Baldwin charging at the photographer with a face like, fuck you, man.  Like, he's got a tough guy face, and the photographer looks like this. 
[00:45:00]  He's just, he's bent over backwards, like he's trying to get away from him.  His camera's flailing.  I believe that he didn't punch.  He said that punch was never thrown.  He didn't punch.  They always say that.  If the guy's hand touches him, he was punched.  Guarantee there's a lawsuit.  They all want you to hit them so they can sue you.  It is considered assault, I do believe.  Oh, of course it is.  If you even touch them.  I think there's even a battery, a type of battery where you don't even have to touch 
[00:45:30]  somebody.  It's a weird fucking thing.  If you scream in their face?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Front page of the Daily News.  Yeah, that's a big one.  And then he, so he did that out on Park Avenue, was it?  On Park Avenue!  Is that what that was?  Yeah, I believe so.  And then he took a sheet from the hotel he was staying in and covered himself with a  sheet or a blanket and walked down the street the rest of the way until he got to his car  with a sheet over his head.  Really?  Looking like a complete lunatic.  Are there no photos of that?  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I didn't see it.  Yeah, that.  That's how he walked down the street the rest of the way so the photographers wouldn't  really get his picture.  He had a hotel sheet over his head walking to his car with his assistant holding his suit  and various paperwork for him.  His suit?  Where's his suit?  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a fucking rough job to be Alec Baldwin's assistant.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Got to put out a few flyers, I believe.  I never met him.  We said hello at a Paul McCartney concert.  I don't think he knows me.  I just said hi to him as a fan. 
[00:46:30]  At Apollo?  Yeah, one of those two shows.  Oh.  And my only interaction with him has been just seeing him there.  So I don't know what he's like as a guy.  Judah Friedlander loves him, though.  He works for me.  Really?  Yeah.  So he's great, yeah.  Well, if you're a guy and you're hanging out with him and stuff, I'm sure that's no problem.  But, you know, if you're a photographer or his ex-wife, I've made an ass.  No, you've made an ass.  No, I've made an ass.  Yeah, that's an ass.  Iraq, do we have that? 
[00:47:00]  Why don't we have that, Iraq?  Why don't we have that?  Oh, we should have that one.  That's a great clip.  Oh, man.  Ugh.  That guy.  Yeah, he's been in the news a few times saying some shit that's gotten him in trouble.  And I guess he gave up on his Twitter.  But then he went back.  Didn't he go back on it?  He went back, but it was never as big as when he first started, because he was saying some shit.  He's just volatile on there with his lib talk.  Oh, here it is. 
[00:47:30]  Alec Baldwin.  Phone call to daughter.  Hey, I want to tell you something, okay?  And I want to leave a message for you right now.  Because, again, it's 1030 here in New York on a Wednesday.  And once again, I've made an ass of myself trying to get you a phone to call you at a specific time.  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whatever I'm doing, and I go when I make that phone call at 11 o'clock in the morning in New York, and if you don't pick up the phone at 10 o'clock at night, and you don't even have that goddamn phone turned on, I want you to know something, okay? 
[00:48:00]  I'm tired of playing this game with you.  I'm leaving this message with you to tell you, you have insulted me for the last time.  You have insulted me.  You don't have the brains or the decency.  As a human being, I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or you're a child or that you're a child or that your mother is a thawless pain in the ass who doesn't care about what you do as far as I'm concerned. 
[00:48:30]  You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone, and when I come out there next week, I'm going to fly out there for the day just to straighten you out on this issue.  I'm going to let you know just how disappointed in you I am and how angry I am with you that you've done this to me again.  You've made me feel like shit, and you've made me feel like a fool over and over and over again. 
[00:49:00]  And this crap you pull on me with this goddamn bone situation that you would never dream of doing to your mother, and you do it to me constantly and over and over again.  I am going to get on a plane, or I'm going to come out there for the day, and I'm going to straighten your ass out.  I see you. Do you understand me? I'm going to really make sure you get it.  Then I'm going to get on a plane, and I'm going to turn around, and then I'm going to come home. 
[00:49:30]  So you've got to be ready Friday the 20th to meet with me.  So I'm going to let you know just how I feel about what a rude little pig you really are.  You are a rude, faultless little pig, okay?  I love when he's like, yeah, I know you're 12.  It's like he was talking to a grown woman.  I know.  Just lambasting her.  And the only line that makes him look awful is, you're a little pig.  Yeah, yeah.  Up until then, he's fine.  Just a parent yelling, and I was like, ugh.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  But he was that cunt ex-wife of his age.  Bad-mouthing the ex-wife to the kid.  That's never good.  But you know, she does it too, and she wanted so much money from him, probably in a divorce.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he was fighting all that divorce stuff, and Kim Basinger has fucking money.  Yeah, yeah.  She's maybe not as much as him, but she's not some poorhouse fucking broke woman.  I love how his South Shore, Long Island trash fucking accent comes out when he's yelling  on the phone, though.  I'm going to be in New York.  He doesn't sound like he does when he's doing his nice, deep announcer voice in commercials. 
[00:50:30]  But when he was doing that, all I'm hearing is fucking the guy from Glengarry Glen Ross.  Oh, man, yeah, yeah.  That's a fucking great movie.  Put that coffee down.  You think I'm fucking with you?  I am not fucking with you.  He was up.  That's the best cameo ever.  Rick.  And that was pretty much him, I guess.  Yeah.  He had to just play himself, and not a stretch.  He really was a mean asshole in that film.  What a fucking bastard.  Should we take a little break and eat?  Yeah, we got our food here.  Yay! 
[00:51:00]  Harvey Weinstein is in today.  I'm very happy.  At 9.30.  Yes.  I'm just getting a text.  I think Mike Baker's coming in today.  Oh, is he?  He's not on the list.  Oh, well.  Yeah, Roland just texted me.  Wow.  What time is he coming?  Mike.  I think like 8 o'clock.  Okay.  That's cool.  Okay.  Tell some fucking secret agent stories.  All right.  We'll eat and return.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Ah.  Good morning, sexy. 
[00:51:30]  What's this about?  It's just a rejoiner.  You didn't say good morning.  Good morning.  Yeah.  It's just a rejoiner.  Hi.  Welcome.  Welcome back.  What the hell do I want to hit on?  Hold on.  Oh, oh, the, uh, what the fuck was going on out in the hallway?  Uh, because all I saw, I saw our, the handsome intern. 
[00:52:00]  With the webbed toes.  With the webbed toes.  That ruins his handsomeness.  Yeah, definitely.  Um, dancing.  I, I, now I couldn't hear anything.  I just was looking through the glass and I saw him dancing and, and of course it was  right after Sam walked out the door.  So I only assume you, again, treating the, um, interns like your personal little puppets  and toys around this place.  What were you having him do?  I didn't even ask.  Well, he said, uh, uh, doctor, I asked her to Dr. Pepper and he said, it makes the world 
[00:52:30]  taste better.  And I go, is that even the catchphrase?  Is that the slogan?  I don't, I don't know that that's the slogan.  I stopped, uh, knowing the slogan when it was, I'm a pepper, be a pepper too.  And he goes, yeah, the song, Dr. Pepper.  And he started singing this Dr. Pepper song and dancing and snapping his fingers.  Eric, is Robin in there?  He looked, um, he looked a little retarded.  Do you want to see the dance in the song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to know what the heck was all about.  I like to bullwhip his legs while he does it. 
[00:53:00]  I like to make him dance like fucking Pesci made spider dance.  Dance, you motherfucker.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  I noticed he's, he's a, he's probably the most cordial intern.  Uh, I usually, I don't know why, but when I'm walking up the hallway to, uh, come here  to the studio, he's walking the other way and usually, um, has a fine, how do you do?  He doesn't avert his eyes like the other interns.  He's always psyched. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, he is always psyched.  Yeah.  Just a very happy guy.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be anywhere.  Look at him.  And he's been in the office telling Eric, fuck you.  So that's funny.  Has he really?  Yeah.  You're at the point already?  You're fuck you-ing E-Rock?  Well, um.  Like on his way out.  That's your boss.  On his way out, he'll just pop his head back in the door and be like, Eric, fuck you,  bro.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  That's your boss, man.  It happens a couple times, but it's not- 
[00:54:00]  Blatant insubordination.  Blatant.  I mean, that everyone laughs at and finds hilarious.  E-Rock, you tolerate that?  No.  Oh, what do you do?  What do you do?  Do you, uh, reprimand him?  Oh, I yell at him and everything, but then all of a sudden he'll leave, and then Sam's  going, go back in there and do it again.  No, no, I didn't do that.  I don't believe Sam would actually do something like that.  No, no.  You wouldn't encourage that behavior, wouldn't you?  Because I can see his feet sticking out from under the photos on the wall there, where  Sam's just laughing in the hallway as he comes in. 
[00:54:30]  No, I mean, I think it's funny, but I don't encourage it.  Oh, so you can see Sam's dumb, long feet?  Yeah.  Awful Mad Magazine feet that I hate.  Or Roland whispering while he's sitting in the office with Eric.  Say fuck you.  Say fuck you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just say fuck you.  And then Rob's over there going, no, I can't.  No, I don't want.  No, no.  All right.  And then two seconds later, hey, Eric, fuck you.  Gives him a good fuck you.  What other interns are in today?  Well, there's Connor.  Connor.  Aw, let's get the crazy guy. 
[00:55:00]  He's doing a food run right now.  That's Kevin.  He's in tomorrow.  Oh.  The one who's not on his Adderall because...  Right, right, right.  Why is he not in Adderall?  Because we wanted to see what he was like without his Adderall.  He said he felt more comfortable not on his Adderall.  So I said, well, you shouldn't take your Adderall.  I'm very surprised that we didn't have the lawyers step in and say, hey, you can't tell  somebody to stop their medication.  I don't think anybody's listening to the after show around here.  Oh.  Because we were also...  Get away with everything.  We were also fairly surprised. 
[00:55:30]  Why don't we push all of our bits that we want to do to the after show.  Yeah.  And then we'll get away with it.  Act like you're leaving and just walk right back in.  We'll hang out.  Yeah.  And be able to do all the fun things we've wanted to do.  Plus, who would listen medically to you anyway?  Well, we told him to contact...  We specifically said, you know, you'll probably, if you're actually going to do this,  want to call your doctor and find out if that is what you should do.  Did you talk to your doctor?  He stopped taking it and got confused? 
[00:56:00]  Because he sounds very confused on the air.  To tell you the truth, he was confused before.  Beforehand.  While he was taking it, too.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He'll start talking and then just drop off and not finish what he's talking about.  No.  And any question that you ask him, because he gets confused so easily, he looks at you  as if you're absurdly asking this question.  Yeah.  He gets very agitated.  It's like, hey, well, how come you didn't listen to the show today?  And he's like, well, I was doing stuff.  And you go, well, no.  First of all, that doesn't answer the question. 
[00:56:30]  Second of all, it wasn't an absurd question.  The worst part was he doesn't seem to want to be here or do radio.  No.  Like he said, he doesn't want to be in radio.  He doesn't care about radio.  And he's just here because it's here.  Then he does kind of belong here.  Yeah.  Ironically.  What is he doing here?  I don't know.  He's not sure.  He said he's trying to figure things out.  He said at one point, he's 20, I think.  And he said earlier he did want to do radio, but now he thinks that he's not good at it. 
[00:57:00]  What, does he want to be a fireman or an astronaut now?  Fucking kids.  Don't know what he wants to do.  Rob, do you want to do radio?  What about you?  Yeah, yeah.  I want to do something in the radio or television industry.  Yeah?  I bet television, right?  You want to do what?  Radio or television.  Radio.  Radio.  Yeah, radio.  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Radio.  I thought it was a slip-up at first, but no, he says it like that.  He's probably more cut out to just be a model then.  Oh, yeah.  Just Abercrombie and Fitch. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Just fucking.  Maybe go hang out topless at the store.  Yeah, do that, right?  Spray cologne on girls and they'll giggle and take the picture with you.  Yeah.  How many times a day do girls just walk up to you and say, could you fuck me, please?  Right?  Happens all the time.  A bunch.  Right?  Do you do that?  That's what girls do to handsome guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do okay, you know.  Until they see those feet of yours.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I forgot he's got those awful tootsies.  Just keeps fucking shoes on when he goes to fuck.  Yeah.  Nothing on but shoes.  Rotten duck feet.  It's the duck-footed stud. 
[00:58:00]  Girls get thrown by that?  Not really.  I mean, it's really not noticeable unless, like, they stare at my feet, so it's like, whatever.  Yeah.  Maybe a little 69-ing and they look down your legs and see those feet and just go, what the fuck?  I feel like there's fucking scuba gear on.  Why don't you take your scuba feet off?  Your flippers.  Paint your feet blue.  Fins.  Swimmy fins.  So you want to do radio?  Yeah, I think so.  And what would you want to do in TV?  Uh, anything. 
[00:58:30]  Behind the scenes, beyond air.  Well, that's a big difference.  Over at all.  Yeah.  Have a lighting tech in the ceiling.  Cover everything.  I'd like to do behind the scenes or in front of them.  Behind the camera, in front of it, above it, below it.  Inside the camera.  Next to it.  I'll be a mechanism of some sort.  Yeah, I really did cover all ground.  Yeah, yeah.  He's all over the place.  Well, I'm not sure yet.  I mean, I want to still learn and everything like that.  How old did gentlemen are you?  21.  Oh, 21.  I remember 21, full of piss and vinegar, and ready to go out and conquer the world. 
[00:59:00]  Nah, I wasn't really.  I didn't care about anything.  So, uh, when you see yourself, what do you see yourself doing?  None?  Oh, I'm not sure yet.  We all have, like, views of ourselves, right?  Like, what we really want to do.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I was 21 when I started interning here.  Wow!  And now you're fucking, like, 38, 39 now?  I'm not that old, no.  Oh.  That's E-Rock, you're thinking.  Oh, right, right.  He just turned 39.  Florida's own E-Rock.  Wow!  So you're 21. 
[00:59:30]  Got the world by the balls.  You got a girlfriend?  No.  Probably better off.  Oh, man.  Any of the female interns talking to you?  A couple.  Oh, yeah!  That's a couple.  Office romance!  Whoa, a couple.  Yeah, they're pretty.  Oh, you got a couple of digits, too?  You got a couple of digits.  Whoa!  Fucking people, right?  They just walk around.  Yeah, number, please.  Yeah, yeah, hey, what up?  I'll take those digits, if you don't mind.  Digits? 
[01:00:00]  How'd you ask for the digits?  Did you say, I want your number, or did she say, hey, here it is?  Well, it was more like, hey, what's your plans this weekend?  And then I was like, I don't know yet.  Wait, wait, they said to you?  Well, I said it to them.  Oh, I was going to say.  Well, he did kind of make it seem like they said it to him.  Like, hey, you looked up to him and said, what's your plans?  Well, I mean, you know, conversation throughout the building, and then, hey, what are you doing this weekend?  I'm not sure yet.  Here, here's my number.  All right.  I don't know who's who in this discussion.  I know.  There's two people that sound exactly like you.  Him and E-Rock. 
[01:00:30]  Hey.  Hey, what are you doing?  I don't know.  How about you?  I'm one person.  Yeah.  Now, you're the one that went to that all-boys school, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you used to, I hear tell through Sam Roberts, that you used to do some, you used to play  little games, little reindeer games over there at the all-boys school.  Yeah, I mean, you know, if you didn't play the games, you were gay.  What game, what was the name of the game?  Oh, Where's Your Junk?  Where's Your Junk? 
[01:01:00]  Where's Your Junk?  Where's Your Junk?  And if you didn't play the game, you were gay.  Oh, that's how they got around it.  Oh.  Where's Your Junk?  I don't listen to the show.  You, uh, when we were in the locker room, right, and, uh, we would have our hands by  our sides.  Oh, boy.  And we would just go around.  It's kind of like Marco Polo.  With the lights on or off?  Lights were off.  Okay.  Lights off.  Kind of like that, yeah.  Danny just pulled up a great photo.  Were you clothed or nude? 
[01:01:30]  Clothed.  Clothed.  Okay.  And, uh, we just turned the lights off.  Just someone who, you know.  And they'd say, let's play Where's Your Junk?  Yeah.  Where's Your Junk?  Okay, so how many guys would play Where's Your Junk?  Uh, usually around, like, six to, I don't know, ten, eleven.  Okay, so six to ten.  That's like twenty balls.  Yeah, let's say eight.  You guys would all stand in the locker room with your clothes on, hands by your side, the  lights are out, and?  And, uh, you would go around grabbing people's junk. 
[01:02:00]  And, uh, if you didn't get yours grabbed, then you won.  How does anyone know?  Well, you'd say, I grabbed your junk, and then...  Holy shit.  How old were you when you played this?  Uh, sixteen.  Sixteen?  I mean, yeah.  Wow.  We'd just go around, like, I don't know.  And you, you, you, I still don't get how you know if somebody didn't get their junk grabbed.  Who's the genius who conceptualized this?  Oh, man.  How do I grab his cock, his cock? 
[01:02:30]  Right, right.  Ha ha!  I want a room full of dick to hold on to.  How can I swing this?  And whoever doesn't do it is a fag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How did they say that if you, if you didn't do it, you're, it's gay?  Didn't anybody say, no, see?  Nah, I mean, if you, like, once you did it, you'd just be like, ha ha, faggot.  Like, just make fun of them.  To them with the mirror?  Ha ha ha!  Wow, that's, uh.  So you'd have to be on the honor system pretty much, though. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so it's like, hey, I didn't get my junk grabbed, and then everyone went, aw, poor guy.  Did you ever grab one that was hard?  No.  Come on, they were never hard?  Did you ever grab one that felt bigger than the other ones, though?  Oh, yeah.  So you really felt through the, you knew?  Well, it was just, like, quick grab.  It was like, pfft.  And were they wearing sweatpants sometimes, no underwear?  No, no, no, just khakis.  How could you see where they were, though?  That's the whole reason.  It's like.  Oh, you didn't, when people were hiding?  So you would just reach, like, into the darkness, and hope you ended up with a cock in your hands. 
[01:03:30]  Because you had to have your hands pretty much, like, on your side.  Oh, by your side.  So did you grab their ass cheeks, too?  Wait, wait, so you would have to turn toward people and fucking, like, bump?  Yeah.  So your dicks are bumping together, too?  Yeah, kind of.  Oh, wow.  Jeez.  It's bad enough to grope around, but you're talking, the one rule is to keep you, like.  It was like, just, you could just, you could move your forearms, but you can't.  Do you now understand that that was just an excuse?  Oh, yes.  To touch each other's penises?  Somebody so wanted to just touch dick. 
[01:04:00]  How often did you play it?  Oh.  Every night.  Like, I don't know, whenever someone, after gym class, and we'd have gym, like.  Oh, sweaty and nice.  It's good when you want balls after they've been fucking climbing up and down a rope.  Oh, St. Dusky's there.  Yeah.  So who would suggest it?  How would it get suggested?  I don't know.  It was just, like, one person would just grab your nuts, and then just be like, where's  the junk?  Let's go.  He would start by grabbing your nuts while the lights were still on?  Oh, that's not fucking nice.  Did you ever, did anybody ever start the game by grabbing you?  No.  Did you ever start the game? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You started the game.  It was just fun.  Did you have one guy specifically that you liked to grab his nuts?  No.  Would you always go for the black guy?  Yeah.  Junk grab.  No, we didn't really have any kids in our school.  We've got your shaft.  Yeah, it was nice.  The school there, man.  Wow.  So you would grab someone and say, let's go for a game of junk grab, and everybody was  just automatically on board?  Yeah.  And you went to an all-boys school?  Yeah.  It was the best time of my life.  I loved it.  Wow. 
[01:05:00]  How could that be the best time?  Because, like, going into school, we would just rip on teachers.  It was just like, every day-  We do that in our schools, and there were girls around, too, to fucking play games with  and grab, they could grab your dick and-  What would you rip on teachers for?  Like, I bet he likes grabbing pussies.  Ah-ha.  Well, like, uh, my one English teacher, he had a stroke.  Not that-  Hilarious.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  So did all of you during that game?  Ah-ha.  So he, like, was paralyzed on, like, half his body. 
[01:05:30]  Not half his body, but, like, his face and everything, so he can't hear out of one ear.  So we would throw quarters at the window, and say, a bird ran over there, ran into the window,  and, like, just everybody in the class would just run over to the window, and he would be  like, argh, and he'd just get all pissed off and everything like that.  And then, wait, you'd turn off the lights and start touching each other's dicks.  I'd rather play the dick grab game.  And then grab half of his dick, or his one atrophied ball.  And what's the other game you used to play?  Oh, credit card swipe?  No.  Credit card swipe? 
[01:06:00]  Well, that was-  This was the game, like, over the whole day.  So it was like-  Oh, not just gym class.  No.  No, not one short, fleeting grab of a cock.  Yeah, so you would go around, and, like, in the hallway and everything, just, like,  go up the guy's ass crack with, like, your hand or a book or something like that, and  they'd call him a faggot.  Were there any games that didn't take place in the portion of the body where the bathing  suit covers?  It was always right there, your fun little games. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, there was the nipple suck, where we would just go around sucking each other's nipples.  That's what happens, by the way, in these stupid all-boys schools.  Yes.  Because guys get-  You get your sexual curiosity, so they start just taking out their curiosity on each other,  because there's no girls there to fucking try it out with.  Yeah, yeah.  That's-  It's definitely-  That's all it is.  I would have to agree.  Because you want to touch and be touched.  It's sexually based.  Let's be fucking reasonable here.  Yeah.  Your-  Your, uh, adolescence, your, uh, hormones are going crazy.  Raging.  And then they're throwing you all together as just boys in a school. 
[01:07:00]  It's, uh, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  What the hell are you doing?  What would your dad say if he walked into a locker room and you and your friends were  playing Where's Your Junk?  Tarryton in mouth.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  What the hell are you faggots doing? 
[01:07:30]  He would take a drag off the tarryton.  Oh, I'd take a drag.  One eye would shut, because the smoke, like, wafted into it.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, you would be such a faggot in his eyes.  You'd have to go through man training like I did, which entails just drinking beer, having  sex with a fucking town slut.  And almost being molested in the bushes by a fucking-  Yes, by a Mexican.  So, um-  Did your parents know you were playing Where's Your Junk?  No.  Did they listen?  No.  Why not?  They're not proud of you? 
[01:08:00]  No.  Uh, my mom listened, like, the first day.  Mm-hmm.  And she was like, I think what they're saying is funny, but they curse a lot.  And it's like-  Hey, fuck that.  She's right.  You really do.  So, wait a minute.  So, now, let me ask you.  Was there one guy who you noticed would grab your junk a lot?  There had to be a pattern.  You had to notice a pattern.  Yeah, there were a couple.  Like, alright, like, two weeks ago, I saw a kid from high school, and I haven't seen him  in a while, and, like, he came over, and, like, we were at the bar, and he was just, like,  like, touching me and everything. 
[01:08:30]  It was just like-  Oh, he wanted to play the game again.  How was he touching you?  Oh.  Like, he would grab my balls.  What?  At the bar?  Yeah.  You're not in a boy school anymore.  Exactly.  It's like-  At the bar?  Yeah.  He grabbed your balls at the bar.  He would just, like, grab my nipples and shit.  He'd just be like, what the fuck are you doing?  Is he out of the closet?  Holy shit.  No, but I think he's, like-  For sure he is.  Oh, yeah.  So, he grabbed your cock at the bar.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  And what did he say?  Wow.  He was like, hey, how's it going?  And I was just like, dude, like-  Yeah, but you know what?  Hey, we touched cocks in school, but- 
[01:09:00]  We objected.  Not now.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah.  Dude.  Bobby the champ used to do stuff like that.  Bobby the champ, no homo intern.  No homo.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Maybe, yeah.  I think, like, once everyone got out of high school, it was just like, all right, whatever.  Like, this is done.  Yeah, but would you ever- would you guys go off to college and then meet up for summer?  Like, the American Pie kids, but then turn off the lights and grab each other's jokes?  Exactly.  Did you ever do it when everyone was in their underwear in the locker room?  No.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Any of that?  No.  Unfortunately, not.  Any bear fucking bear ass games?  But gym shorts.  Any snapping the towels in the locker room on the asses?  A horse play?  Yeah?  No.  Horse play like in Oregon?  Isn't that where they fuck the horses?  Yeah, Washington.  Oh, whatever.  Sorry.  Gym shorts, though.  Pacific Northwest, I'm sure they're fucking in there, too.  You know.  Gym shorts, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Testicles hanging out of the fucking pant leg.  So there was one guy that would just probably always go for you.  Who was the one student, without his last name, but who was the one student that would 
[01:10:00]  always go for you?  Joe.  What would Joe do?  He would just...  And he was big.  He played football.  Of course he did.  He played in college, too, and everything.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Don't ask, don't tell.  So what would happen?  Like, the lights would go out and Joe would just beeline for you?  Yeah, pretty much.  Wow.  It was weird.  Sometimes.  How would Joe grab it too long?  Yeah.  Did anyone ever grab it too long?  Like, a really good grab?  Did someone ever grab you until you came? 
[01:10:30]  With their mouth?  Wow, man.  How long would they grab you for?  Just, like, a quick second.  Not even.  But would you know if Joe was grabbing you?  Yeah.  Because Joe would leave his hand there?  And you could feel his big, beefy man hands, his linebacker hand.  Oh, God.  Sweating.  How did you get girls if you wanted them?  I mean, like...  After school.  There was...  We had, like, sister schools, I guess.  Like, all-girls schools.  Where they would just fucking...  Fucking scissoring.  Yeah.  Grabbing their little titties. 
[01:11:00]  They were playing stink finger in the locker room.  That's what you'd hear.  The lights would go out and you'd hear giggling and...  Stink finger.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  That sounds like you were having a blast over there at that school.  It was a good time.  And this guy that touched your dick, how did that whole thing end in the bar?  You're buying a drink?  Flurry hole?  What happened?  No, I just, like...  It was in front of girls, too.  And I was just like, like, get the fuck away from me.  Hey, let's do this in front of men, not in front of the girls like this. 
[01:11:30]  You're crazy.  You're not helping your case here.  I know.  Yeah, you objected.  Like, dude, what the fudge?  Dude, come on.  It was just awkward.  Kiss hello first.  What the hell?  Yeah.  Were you in theater when you were in high school?  I did a little production.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  A little bit.  But it was like eighth grade.  What type of musical?  What musical was it?  It was Bye Bye Birdie.  Where did you play?  B-I-B-I. 
[01:12:00]  I was Conrad Birdie.  You were Birdie.  I was.  Of course, starring role right there.  Oh, yeah.  Can you sing?  Not really.  What's a musical?  What'd you have to sing?  Um, like, uh...  It's one of the classics that you sang.  Yeah.  I've never heard it.  I've got a lot of living to do.  Oh.  There are chicks just right for some kissing.  He gets right into it.  What's the song?  There are chicks.  He's trying to lower his voice and everything. 
[01:12:30]  I'm grabbing cotton in the dark room.  Uh, it's like, I got a lot of living to do.  Sizzling steaks.  Oh.  That's terrible.  Sing it.  What is this?  What is this?  It's horrible.  Well, come on.  Oh, I forget the words.  All right.  Just sing the Dr. Pepper song.  You're singing outside.  Dr. Pepper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You make the world taste better.  You make the world taste better.  He's dancing like a... 
[01:13:00]  He starts dancing when he sings the song.  Son of a bitch.  What are you dancing around like that for?  What are you, queer?  Are you all sexual?  No, not at all.  Have you ever experimented with anything further?  Nope.  And don't lie.  I'll smell it on you.  Everyone says that there's always this experimentation thing, but everyone denies it.  No.  What happened?  Well, how do you know that you're not?  What happened at the school?  Because I don't get hard when I'm around guys.  Oh.  Never. 
[01:13:30]  Never.  When's the one time you did?  Come on.  Don't lie.  Talk in a room full of guys.  We understand.  Exactly.  Let's turn the lights off.  Yeah.  Grab each other.  What was the time that you wound up getting a rod around a guy?  No.  Never really.  Had to be.  I've gotten like random boners in school, but that's it.  Yeah, yeah.  Random.  You know.  Looking at somebody.  Did you ever get a random boner while you were playing Grab Your Junk?  No.  How about this?  You, um, you're at school, you got some porn videos.  You ever watch porn videos with your guy pals? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  We had laptops in school.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So, like, people just always watch porn.  A little porn.  And what?  You ever jack off with your buddies watching some porn?  No.  You never jacked off with another guy in the room?  Nope.  Oh.  Did you ever have your dick out with another guy in the room?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Now, what is that?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, just like, just like, I don't know.  You want me to see it.  Do you ever do tricks with it?  Like, swinging around and stuff to make each other laugh?  No.  No.  I'd just be like, oh, I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  Why would you have your dick out in a room with another guy?  It was like a bunch of guys.  Oh, like a gang bang.  So, what would you do?  Like, come on.  Yeah, what's the context of that?  I don't know.  It would just be like...  Hey, let's pull our dicks out.  Kind of.  Or like, I would never pull it out.  It'd just be like pantsing.  Someone else would?  Yeah, who would pull it out?  Yeah, who would pull it out for you?  Joe.  Joe.  What would you do?  And how would all the dicks come out?  I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  It would just somehow come out.  No, it doesn't work that way.  It doesn't just mosey out.  It has to be taken out.  It would just...  I don't know.  It would just kind of...  Like, what would you guys be doing?  You'd all be hanging out in the room watching what?  Or talking or doing what?  Drinking?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of drinking.  Okay, so you all had a few beers.  You're feeling loose.  Yeah, and then...  Never any touching.  Never skin-to-skin touching.  Okay.  Good.  Just a lot of masturbating and looking at each other.  I don't...  I don't get it.  Well, hold on.  No skin-to-skin touching.  I don't get it.  So what would happen?  What would you guys be drinking? 
[01:15:30]  What happened?  Walk us through it.  And then, like...  I don't know.  You'd just, like, flash from your dick.  Because it's like, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  So, wait.  Who's going, ah!  The guy with his mouth open?  Ah!  Ah!  Playing doctor.  Ah!  Ah!  So you'd flash the dick, and then what would happen?  He'd go, ah!  Like, I don't want to see that.  But he'd look anyway.  I don't know.  And then you'd call him a faggot.  It's like...  Ah!  You know, that's just the...  That's the excuse.  Yeah.  That's supposed to make everything better. 
[01:16:00]  You ever see, like, that movie Waiting?  No.  No?  No.  No?  No.  But I have seen Philadelphia.  So, okay.  So, you flash your dick at a guy, and he goes, ah!  Not the balls, the dick?  The balls, too.  Well, you can cup the balls and make it like a brain.  Like, I know people who flash their balls as a goof.  Yeah.  But not their dicks.  Yeah.  I have a guy I know who likes to just be like, guys, this is nuts!  And point down to him, and he's holding his balls.  He's got a punchline for it, though.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  It's not like this guy just hanging out with a bunch of guys with their dicks out.  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  But he's never pulled out his shaft and been like, look at this guy.  Look at this.  Presenting it.  And then, did everyone in the room have their dicks out?  Uh, no.  No, no, no, no.  That would be crazy.  Just you.  Yeah.  Oh, someone.  Like, one person would just be like, ah!  And who judged him?  Yeah.  Yeah, was that it?  How?  Who had the biggest of you and your friends?  Joe.  I don't know.  No, I don't know.  Yes, you do.  Yeah, you know. 
[01:17:00]  Who had the biggest?  You know.  We know you know.  I don't know.  There were...  Okay, fine, fine.  Who had the nicest then?  Well, I don't have to say me.  Is that...  Who had the biggest penis of you and your friends?  Probably girth-wise?  It was this kid, Mike.  Oh, Mike had the girthiest.  What about the length?  This other kid, Rob.  What about sack, who had a nice full sack?  I never, like, judged sacks.  Just shafts.  No.  Just shafts.  What am I going to do with those brawls? 
[01:17:30]  You can't put the balls in you.  Just lovely sack.  Checking out girth and width.  That's all he cared about.  Wonderful sack.  So Rob and Mike, Rob had the length and Mike, so I put them together.  It's perfect, right?  Oh, yeah.  Rob actually just had a baby.  It's weird.  Yeah?  Why?  Because he's got a big dick.  It's weird.  Yeah.  No, it's just like...  Nothing cocky.  Like, we're 21.  I've never...  I don't know.  Never really seen a vagina.  Wow. 
[01:18:00]  That's something.  You guys...  I bet there's so much shit going on.  What were the...  Was everybody that played these games, were they all white or was there mixed races going on?  No, no.  All white.  How did I know?  This doesn't happen.  I don't think this happens.  Black people was...  We didn't really have black people in our school.  There were like three of them and they were just the whitest kids ever.  Paradise High School?  Yeah.  That was nice.  I had to deal with give me 50 cent.  But he had to deal with, you know, touching guys to a cucks. 
[01:18:30]  Let me hold a dolly.  Yeah.  And he's like, let me hold a cuck.  I'd much rather let you hold the dollar.  You'd have all the dollars.  Yes.  Wow.  Yo, let me hold that dick, son.  What?  No.  Yo, for a minute.  Let me get that dick, bitch.  For a minute.  I give it back.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yo, I'll give it right back, son.  Yo, let me hold that dick.  Did you enjoy...  Did Joe ever do the flash in the room?  Like, hey, look at that, you faggot.  No, actually.  He's actually the one who's never done it.  Yeah.  Did Joe have a big penis?  Joe?  I don't know.  How did it feel when you grabbed it? 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  I'd never go for Joe's dick.  How would you know?  Why would you...  Why would you choose whose dick you went for?  I mean, who's...  Whose dick would you go for?  Like, so when...  Before you would turn the lights out...  It was so fucked up.  There had to be one guy who's dick.  Would you, like, have the lights on and be like, okay, I'm targeting him?  And then the lights would go out and you'd go for him?  I wouldn't really, like, target anybody.  You'd just, like, go around.  But, like, I would stay...  So you knew your friends based on cock feel?  No, I'd...  No.  Like, you could feel, like...  You just...  You could feel the girthier one.  You're like, I know who that kid is. 
[01:19:30]  Well, it wasn't, like, dark, dark in the room.  It was, like...  Oh, you know.  You could still make eye contact.  It was romantic.  Just enough to see the goodness.  So you would, uh...  Now, who would you normally go for?  If you had to target somebody, you'd avoid Joe.  Yeah, I'd avoid Joe.  He was a little...  Yeah.  Risky.  A little, uh...  He liked it a little too much.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Of course not.  Obviously not.  Yeah.  I just don't get it.  So who would you target?  Um...  I don't know.  There were just a bunch of people.  This kid, Mike. 
[01:20:00]  Another kid, Mike.  Not girthy, Mike.  Girthy, Mike.  He didn't like the girth on Mike.  It was intimidating.  He liked the other Mike, who was just average.  He liked to hold the entire one.  He didn't like Mike because he couldn't wrap his little hand around it.  Yeah.  I just don't understand this whole thing.  No?  Don't get it.  It was just like...  No, it wasn't.  He's trying to...  It wasn't.  You don't think it was?  No.  It wasn't just... 
[01:20:30]  What do you think it was?  I think it's a very homoerotic thing with the guys that, uh...  You know, there's no girls around.  Guys are gonna go fucking crazy.  Start grabbing dick.  Start grabbing dick.  When I was a kid, my dad had the biggest porno collection.  Like, he had magazines and tapes and everything.  And so once the word was out that that's what was going down at my house, all my friends,  they always wanted to come to my house because they wanted to watch the porno.  Yeah.  So then you get to the age where, you know, it makes you feel something and now all my friends wanted to come over and jerk off. 
[01:21:00]  Now, no one jerked each other off.  Now, every time this went down, I would feel, I'd be like, why do they always want to jerk off with each other?  And, like, back then, that was weird to me.  And if someone tried to grab my dick, that would be a big no.  Yes.  So your friends would jerk off and you'd be in the room watching them jerk off?  No, no, no, no.  They would...  Yeah.  No, they would...  It would be like, let's all cut school, come to my house, and then, you know...  Jerk off.  And then some people would be like, oh, let's watch your dad's porno.  Let's pop in a porno.  I'm like, hey, you guys do whatever you want to do.  You know, I'm not... 
[01:21:30]  I'm not going to hang out with you and beat off with you guys.  If your friends came over to your house and were like, let's all jerk off, you would...  If all your friends were jerking off, you wouldn't be like, rad.  No way.  No.  Yes, you totally would.  I would not at all.  You'd succumb to peer pressure.  Probably.  I do succumb to peer pressure easily.  And you'd come.  Oh, do you?  But...  He says he succumbs to...  Yeah, and you'd come, too.  To peer pressure.  Well...  And cock pressure.  The pressure your peers are putting on your dick.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  With their mouths.  That's, uh...  What was the closest you ever came to jacking off with a friend?  I've never, like...  Uh, jacking off with a friend.  I've never, like, thought about it.  Really?  Yeah, I've never, like...  I've never had wanted to do it.  Did you ever jerk off and then for a second while you're jerking off, think of dick grab and be  like, oh, no, no, no, and go back to what you were thinking about before?  No.  Never once?  No.  Did you ever, while you were jerking off, think about...  You catch yourself in the mirror and you get harder?  Did you ever think about, like, while you were jerking off for a second, just for a 
[01:22:30]  quick second, a glimpse of Girthy Mike's cock popped into your brain and then you're like,  no, no, no, and you shook it out and went back to what you were doing?  I mean, it's, like, happened, but, like...  It's, like, happened?  Okay, that's what I thought maybe.  That's not what I'm jerking off.  No, it just pops in there.  You can't control that.  Oh, come on.  What have you thought of Girthy Mike's cock or Rob's longer unit?  I'm thinking of it now.  How does it look?  It's Girthy.  Yeah, I thought so.  It's Girthy.  You'd probably joke about it with him, too. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, how's that Girthy monster doing?  You had a hell of a little upbringing there.  Did you realize that you went to meet one of your high school buddies and the first thing  you wanted to do was touch your dick?  After all these gay frolics in school.  It was, like, sophomore year, not, like, freshman year.  Okay.  Okay, let's see.  Oh, that's different.  At its peak, approximately, how many times per week would someone who's not you touch your 
[01:23:30]  penis?  That's a fair question.  A male who's not you.  Right.  Maybe twice.  At its peak.  At its peak, yeah.  The busiest week.  Yeah.  There's only one game of fucking cock grab a week?  I don't think that's true.  I don't buy that.  Once you find a fun game like that, you're going to want to play it.  You're going to want to play it.  Yeah, of course.  So, I think, I'm pretty sure that cock grab happened more gym classes than not.  Exactly.  You know, like, most, the vast majority of changing for gym involved a game of dick grab. 
[01:24:00]  I think.  You know what I would try to convince my gym class to do?  We all wanted to play crab soccer so we could look up the girls' shorts.  Mmm.  That's what my group of friends were trying to get done.  Right up that short leg.  We never had, we didn't have girls, so it was like.  Oh, yeah.  All we could do was grab dicks.  Boy, that really, really works out for the guys not having girls in the school.  It's a great idea sending your fucking boys to an old boys' school.  Yeah.  Shit like this goes on. 
[01:24:30]  The last thing you'd want is those girls to be a distraction.  Right.  Again, it's like that fucking movie I can never remember the name of where they all get molested.  Oh, Cockrab.  Cockrab.  No, Sleepers with Kevin Bacon.  Yes.  You lived Sleepers.  God, Brad Pitt.  That's a great fucking movie.  Yeah, that's fucking sick shit.  De Niro's in that?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking everyone.  Yeah, De Niro.  Which celebrity, name two celebrities that you would like to play dick grab with that you think  would be fun?  Oh.  Celebrities.  Name two. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I'd have to say Brad Pitt.  Oh, Brad Pitt.  But he's got a little one.  It would be hard to play with.  Oh.  See, I would play with Vanilla Ice.  I've seen the Pumps in a Bump video.  Oh.  He is out.  Is he the big penis?  Yes, it's monsters.  Vanilla Ice?  No, Vanilla Ice.  I'm sorry.  Did I say Vanilla Ice?  MC Hammer is Pumps in a Bump.  Vanilla Ice!  Vanilla!  Vanilla!  Ice!  So who are the two celebrities you'd like to play dick grab with?  Uh, Brad Pitt.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:25:30]  Maybe Al Pacino in his prime.  Oh, wow.  Al Pacino in his prime.  Like Dog Day Afternoon Prime, or what's prime?  Hmm.  I'd say like...  Well, he was probably playing cock grab in that movie.  Yeah.  Do you realize, um, he didn't say, only male celebrity.  You could have picked any hot fucking female actress.  Because of Bailey J.  But you decided to choose two men.  And one of them is the quintessential sexy man Brad Pitt. 
[01:26:00]  Like, every guy, every girl and gay guy thinks Brad Pitt is an attractive man.  I think he's a good actor.  Sure.  There you go.  You think he's handsome?  I think he's handsome.  He's a handsome guy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's...  Oh, here's the video.  Yeah.  Is this Pumps in a Bump?  Oh, of course it is.  Oh, my God.  Hammer time.  You'll like this, right?  You'll like...  Not this part, but you'll get to it.  Hammer's pool was great.  Oh, yeah.  See, you like this.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is Hammer wearing?  This is an obscene video.  Yeah, he's got... 
[01:26:30]  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen this.  He's erect.  Was this on MTV?  Yeah, dude.  This is my desktop background for quite some time.  Doesn't he have a hard-on halfway through the video?  Dude, I'm pretty sure he was fluff for the whole thing.  He's...  Yeah, look at him.  Come on, that's bizarrely big.  Yeah, he's hard.  He's getting pumped up there a little bit.  Would you grab that?  Would you grab that?  How is this a video? 
[01:27:00]  That's when he was trying to redo his image.  Wow.  The MCM, the Can't Touch This thing was, like, lame.  Yeah.  In his made-for-TV movie, he regretted doing this video very much.  Did he?  Yeah, because he's a Christian.  Was he a Christian during this?  Oh, yeah.  And he's got his dick, and he's virtually pumping girls in the ass with it.  He's hard.  Look how good his dick looks.  You like that dick?  What year was this?  This had to be, like, 92 or 93, right?  Yeah, this was probably, like, 90. 
[01:27:30]  It was right as his fame was fleeing.  This was the last hurrah.  And it wasn't a big hit.  It was insane.  Was this popular?  No.  What's the song?  Pumps and the Bump.  Can we hear it?  Here, pump it up a little bit.  He was trying to get that gangster sound.  Yeah, yeah, with that horn thing in the background, kind of.  What's the pumps and the Bump, by the way?  The pumps is the shoes, and the pump is the ass.  It's the same shit.  I thought it was pumps in the Bump.  Oh, pumps and the Bump. 
[01:28:00]  I understand his message.  Ah, yeah.  I do, too.  I do want the pumps and the Bump.  Was this a hand in the Bump?  Answered me.  Pelvic Thrust.  Oh, man.  He's dancing.  He's dancing horribly.  And then after this video, Hammer started coming out in, like, baggy pants and, like,  a gangster, like, wool hat that was, you know, pulled up on top.  Was this a popular song?  No.  No. 
[01:28:30]  What came first, this or Too Legit to Quit?  Too Legit was before this.  Too Legit was at least somewhat popular.  That was popular, even though it was terrible.  Too Legit and Can't Touch This and stuff.  This was, like, the follow-up after he was fading out.  Can't Touch This was his giant hit.  He was trying to reinvent himself.  Did he start to fade in 92?  Yeah.  92, 93.  Whatever year that was.  When was Can't Touch This?  That'd be, like, 89, 90.  90-ish.  Yeah.  Because I was still in, guys, I was still in elementary school.  I remember that.  Aww.  Elementary school. 
[01:29:00]  I think that was about fifth or sixth grade.  Damn.  Can't Touch This.  Don't you feel like having sex to this song?  Yeah.  With a guy?  God, Hammer's dick is so nice.  Yeah, you like that one, don't you?  He shrugged your shoulders.  He shrugged.  You give Sandusky answers.  You should just say, no, it's not a nice cock.  Well, listen.  There's a lot of dicks I didn't touch.  Yeah.  There were far more cocks.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[01:29:30]  That's a lot of cock on that MC.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, now we know why he's called Hammer.  Thanks.  Exactly.  He had Hammer in his pants.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  You want to hear the Dr. Pepper song real quick before he goes?  That's how this whole thing started, Sam.  We might as well come full circle.  All right.  Dr. Pepper, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You make the world taste better.  It's terrible.  It's horrible.  You starred in fucking plays and you can't sing in musicals?  Yeah, you're horrible.  I was those three. 
[01:30:00]  Well, you went to an all-boys school.  So did they have like a guy in a wave?  Yeah, yeah.  This was eighth grade.  Oh, somebody made.  I was in grammar school.  Oh, so you had girls in the school.  Were there productions in your all-boys school?  No.  That would be really rough.  Guys and Guys.  Shakespeare did it.  Yeah.  He dressed up guys in wigs.  Oh, man.  Pops in a bump.  It's a nice ass on that one. 
[01:30:30]  That girl.  That's MC Hammer.  I am just comfortable with my sexuality.  Well, apparently, and other boys' sexuality are comfortable with them.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, AJ PoopyShits.  See you next time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great appearance.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks, guys.  I love chicks.  Yeah.  I love figuring their pussies.  Do you love chicks with tits?  What's your favorite part of a chick?  Do you like the tits?  Probably the labias. 
[01:31:00]  Like the Majora and the Minoras.  Probably just all of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't care.  It doesn't have tits or ass.  Oh, yeah.  No, he doesn't care.  There's nothing I can rub my dick on that's a chick.  It's all good, right?  You don't care?  I mean, like, if I had to choose one, I'd go tits.  All right.  He's a guy who likes chicks with tits.  Yeah.  I've known guys like that.  He's just a guy who likes chicks with tits.  Yeah.  What the fuck, dude?  Yeah.  He's so lackadaisical about the tits and the ass and stuff, but boy, could he talk about 
[01:31:30]  cock.  Yeah.  Here's what it was.  Do you prefer tits or ass?  I don't care.  Which of your friends had the girthiest cock?  That was Joe.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know all those guys.  No, Mike had the girth.  Rob had the length.  Oh, right.  Joe was the football player whose thick linebacker hands would grab this young charge.  That's right.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  I can only touch a lot of that.  I can tell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Crump's in the bumps. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Goodbye, guys.  See you, sweetie.  Get your sweet ass out of here.  He is a sweet boy.  He really is a sweetie.  Yeah, right.  That was uncomfortable.  That was fun.  Yeah.  And I guess we'll return.  Mike Baker's not coming in today.  No?  No.  Okay.  Why?  Roland said he corrected himself, and then he texted  Eric confused me.  Eric confused me.  So he's blaming E-Rock.  Eric confused me.  He said a word yesterday during the shit show when I was driving home. 
[01:32:30]  We can do an after show.  Yeah, whatever.  And I could not understand what he was saying.  You had no idea?  No.  It was, he said it in a way where it just, it was a slur.  The whole thing was just,  Sherizine.  Sherizine.  It was like, Sherizine.  Sherizine.  Sherizine.  And I tried to figure it out, and I did.  And he just doesn't break up words into syllables.  Could you not, like...  Visio.  Oh, he said video, too.  Video was Visio.  Yeah.  Yeah, I said Visio.  Visio. 
[01:33:00]  Visio.  Oh, maybe he was trying to tell you about his new television from Visio.  Visio.  And he switches all his CHs and SHs.  Oh, oh.  Like, he'll go, like, sit down in the chair.  In the chair.  Son of a bish.  Son of a bish.  Yeah.  You son of a bish.  Son of a bish.  Son of a bish.  He's quite a confused little guy.  I want to hear the Sandusky one.  I really want to hear the...  Yeah, yeah.  Let's talk about the Sandusky, because he's...  Wow, he's actually taking a stand today.  I want to hear the...  Today.  What time? 
[01:33:30]  Today.  Today.  Is Court TV still exist, or is that True TV?  It's True TV.  Okay.  But they're not broadcasting the trial, right?  I don't think so.  No, no.  This one's just those artist renderings.  Okay.  It's all state-to-state, which is...  I hate that when they don't put it on TV.  People love watching...  Sensational Trials.  Well, that Casey Anthony thing was pretty compelling.  Don't even have to talk about OJ.  That was great.  All right.  We'll be back in a matter of moments.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:34:00]  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say.  It's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to you.  And Rich Voss.  Louie!  Beans!  I want my money!  A Bronx.  Tail.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees me, he keeps dodging  me, John.  Should I crack him one or what? 
[01:34:30]  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian, stammering his way through a few lines of  film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A Bronx.  Tail. 
[01:35:00]  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  Thanks, E-Rock. 
[01:35:30]  We're in the middle of a discussion.  Couldn't give us another couple seconds?  We're here in the middle of talking with Manna Jumente.  To be fair, I did ask for a long rejoiner, hoping that he'd play something with a nice  40-second hook, but it's pretty good.  This is what I got in the song.  This does work.  It's cool.  I like it.  What would you think about somebody that would get a tattoo of the guy that wrote this song's 
[01:36:00]  name on him?  Probably a couple of things.  Handsome.  Oh.  Funny, fun, awesome, cool.  Son of a bitch.  This is a good song.  Isn't it?  Living Day Girl?  I know.  I like this.  I do like this song a lot.  I like Rob Zombie.  I like Rob Zombie very much.  Yeah.  He's doing a new movie about...  I don't care about his movies.  Hockey.  Hockey?  Yeah.  Oh, that's...  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  Isn't Kevin Smith doing that?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:36:30]  Hockey movie?  I just started getting tweets about it yesterday.  It's about hockey movies.  Yeah, it is.  It's about the hockey movies.  Something about a hockey movie?  It was a hockey movie?  I love that one.  I did say dress a lot, didn't I?  Oh, it was great.  Dress.  Something about a dress.  You had a dress.  It was an ass.  Oh, you certainly were.  I was, of course, Twitter.  Who doesn't just go on Twitter every second of the day, day and night?  It's just something that's just always there. 
[01:37:00]  Has it become a part of your entire life?  Yeah.  Why?  Like, it's weird.  Like, there's never a moment where you would wait for anything.  No.  You would pick up your phone and check Twitter.  There's no downtime anymore where you're doing nothing.  Because the second you're not doing anything, I grab from my phone and I check Twitter.  It's because we have instant access to everything now.  So, like, when's the last time you could basically just be involved in a discussion with everybody? 
[01:37:30]  That's where you have to leave your phone at home sometimes.  No.  Who are you, E.T. or something?  Ah, phone home.  Double phone.  I said, this makes sense.  And I said, phone at home.  Double phone.  Double phone.  E.T. kept running around going, phone at home.  No, he didn't.  Phone at home.  Yes, he did with his fingers glowing.  No, he said, phone home.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  It's the most quotable movie of all time.  E.T., what was it?  Eddie Trunk or something?  That's pretty good.  That metal show. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  It's good for extraterrestrial.  Yeah.  No, it didn't.  It was Eddie Trunk.  Eddie Trunk.  Yeah, I swear.  Wrong on that one.  So, yeah.  You get, like I said, no downtime.  You're constantly looking.  At least I am.  I don't know.  But from the looks of Twitter, there's a lot of fucking people doing that.  Yeah.  It's completely changed how you spend any time of the day, especially when you're not really  doing anything important.  Like, I've had to rewind things I'm watching on TV because I was tweeting something and 
[01:38:30]  missed what I was watching.  Why don't I just watch the fucking movie?  I've had to completely lay off.  Like, I was at the point where it was like, well, I'm not going to just sit here at a red  light.  I got to check what's going on on Twitter.  You know, yeah, yeah.  And that's like not good.  I was kind of doing that yesterday, driving home.  Really?  Yeah.  I noticed.  I was like, oh, what am I doing?  I'm tweeting as I'm driving.  Very illegal.  But then I kept seeing commercials about guys with brain damage who were texting while driving 
[01:39:00]  and got into car accidents.  And that new campaign that's on TV.  They're showing people that are far hucked up.  Yeah.  And it's all from text.  And they show the text.  Yeah.  It's like, here's the text.  And did you see what it said?  Yeah.  Where are where?  It was like, where?  And the letter R.  And that's all he got out.  And then he's like, and I put my shirt on in the morning and I got blown into it. 
[01:39:30]  And then there's the other one with the chick with no legs.  Yeah.  I want to see it.  She's kind of hot, too.  And then I heard this.  I was reading this article about this girl who died because she drove into the back of  a truck.  And the guy that she was dating at the time, like her long term boyfriend, was completely  distraught because he realized that he was texting her.  And like the time matches up completely that she was reading his texts.  Oh, man.  And then drove into the back of an 18 wheeler and killed herself.  What an idiot. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  It's one of those things where they kind of have to do something because it really is.  It's a new phenomenon in the last few years.  A lot of people are getting killed because of it.  I've seen so many cars weaving down the road and doing.  Making baskets.  You know, not weaving.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is he talking about?  Weaving, you know, back and forth down the road.  And you look at them when you pass the car and they're buried in their phone.  Fucking dude.  It's so dangerous.  It's so much worse than I even think drinking and driving. 
[01:40:30]  Wow.  It's way worse than calling.  Oh, man.  Calling.  Like, being on the phone is so much safer than texting.  Yeah, yeah.  Because texting, you have to look down.  You're taking your eyes completely off the road.  Yeah.  Not only is your attention gone, but your eyes are physically not looking anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is fucking pretty graphic spot here.  You're 23 times more likely.  See, it's easier because I drive in the city, so it's a little bit, it's not safe, but it's  a little bit. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, but when an asshole, even if you got into like a fender bender, you feel like such  a dickhead because you're like, I was texting.  And it'd be a nothing text, too.  Yeah.  This is a good commercial.  This fucking.  Wow.  This is a close up of a fucking mock car accident.  Oh, T-boned.  Damn, there's a lot of blood.  Yeah.  What the fuck happened?  We just texted.  Oh, she's hurting.  Oh, great.  Now a plane's going to crash into the car.  They crashed and then got hit.  But this is a very realistic car video.  Like, they really show it. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  And the girls are getting texts from people that are like mad that they're not responding.  So.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Where are you?  They're fucking bloodied in a car.  They're sending emoticons.  Oh, man.  Are these really nice pussy picture?  It's well worth it.  These are actual photos from.  We're looking at just basically fucked up cars.  Yeah.  How do we know these are all from texting and driving?  They could just be taking.  Now they're showing fucking.  Look at that.  Bodies from the Godfather.  That's Sonny giving you shots.  Sonny at the top. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, man.  That is fucked up.  That car was under the front of a truck.  Sonny got out to read a text and that's what happened.  I've seen that truck one before.  That truck one is definitely from text.  Well, I mean, I think it's from texting.  The truck just kind of crunched up on the fucking car.  Yeah.  There's like a sliver of a car on the front of the truck left.  How'd that person do?  Are they okay?  No.  They passed away.  Oh, were they going quickly when they hit each other?  I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Sonny got a text from fucking Talia Shire.  He's beating me.  LOL.  Oh, I don't want to say who has a full boner. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, no.  Why do you have a boner?  These girls were cute in that car.  Oh, is that it?  There's a part where they get hit and then they stop and look at each other and then  a car comes and...  T-bones them, yeah.  Yeah, that was a fucking pretty realistic video.  That was pretty good.  You guys never try to leave your phone alone?  No, why would I do that?  Dude, I should, though.  Why would I go without my phone recently?  It's the greatest.  I went out to eat or something or I went to the cellar and I was like, should I go back  for it?  I'm like, no, leave it alone.  Really?  And you did?  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  I need it with me.  Like, next time you leave the house, just throw the phone down on the couch and walk  out.  No.  Yeah.  I can't do that.  I need to have it with me.  Why?  Because what if something happens that I need to know?  Nothing will happen that you need to know.  I don't know.  A message?  Guess what?  You'll find out about it later.  It'll be all good.  I don't know.  There's life to be lived.  I do, but I live it with my phone.  That's like when I was in Cleveland and it was me, Roland, Troy, and Eric at dinner.  And the whole time, Troy and Eric are out texting the entire time. 
[01:43:30]  I've seen that.  Like, what are we doing?  I try not to do it at dinner, but I will pick it up and check some things if there's a lull  in the conversation.  Troy was trying to get something going with one of those strippers, so I can't be too mad  at him.  Was he?  Oh, he's always trying to get something going.  That's why he's on his phone all the time.  Yeah, he's networking.  He's always working on something.  Doing that, posting Instagrams of him skateboarding.  Is his Instagram good?  He is.  I mean, he's a good Instagrammer, but it is.  He's got a lot of things.  A lot of pictures of him skateboarding. 
[01:44:00]  A lot of activities.  He's always out clubbing and skateboarding, and he's like, hey, here's some people painting  the Brooklyn Bridge, because I was just downtown fucking wandering around the east side.  Like, he's always out and about.  He thinks he's healthy, but he doesn't realize that he's going to die young because he doesn't  sleep enough.  Oh, he needs some sleep.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he always out and about?  He's always out and about.  I'm never out and about.  He is a man about town.  I'm in with chagrin, boo. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, he's, uh, from his Instagrams, he's always, like, in some action.  He's like, yeah, he Instagrams something, and he's like, and it's hashtag longboard, skateboard,  sidewalk, urban, cool.  Fuck, man.  Boss.  Boss.  Ew.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  He doesn't say boss.  I don't know if he does or not.  I'm going to hashtag anything.  It's like, hey, here's a picture.  This is me.  I'm holding a gun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  That's what it is.  Hashtag gun.  Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun. 
[01:45:00]  Can we hear Sandusky, please?  I'm dying to hear this audio.  I have not heard it.  We have an hour until Harvey.  Sandusky.  Why is he?  I'm dying to hear this.  Let's hear, uh.  This is the clip that NBC cut out.  Yeah, it's the one that cut out.  All right.  This is from Acosta's interview.  Yes, yes, yes.  So it's entirely possible that you could have helped young boy A in some way that was not  objectionable.  Young boy A.  While horribly taking advantage of young boy B, C, D, and E. Isn't that possible? 
[01:45:30]  Well, you might think that.  I don't know.  In terms of my relationship with so many, many young people, I would guess that there  are many young people who would come forward, many more young people who would come forward  and say that my methods and what I had done for them made a very positive impact on their  life.  And I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped. 
[01:46:00]  There are many that I didn't have.  I hardly had any contact with who I have helped in many, many ways.  How did they edit that out?  That was the big part right there.  He fucking admitted right there.  NBC?  Who the fuck is in charge over there that that is the piece they edit out?  That's like, ah, we got to edit for time. 
[01:46:30]  Let's edit out the part where he pretty much says that he did fuck some of them.  What shitheads?  Dummies.  Dummies.  Wow.  That is a great...  Boy, the fact that he's...  What a lousy job.  You think he's guilty?  Yeah.  That looks bad, dude.  The fact that he's going to testify at his own trial...  He has to.  He's terrible.  He has to.  He has had no...  For a guy who's like a pretty high profile job with a pretty high profile college football  team.  Yeah.  He has had zero media training. 
[01:47:00]  No.  He has no idea how to answer questions.  He doesn't know how to fucking...  Why would you do the interview?  Yeah.  Because he probably thought he could talk his way around it or out of it.  And he really did not have...  He must be so used to people looking the other way with him that he doesn't realize that  he completely incriminates himself and the people are just so obsessed with college football  that they pretend not to realize what's going on.  And do you honestly think that the prosecution's going to be easier on him than Costas was? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, man.  They're going to fucking slam him, ask him questions about everything he said, and he's  going to have to explain what he meant by that?  Fuck.  Amazing.  You can tell the way he talks that it only takes a few questions before he starts doubling  up on his words.  He just has no clue how to talk and sound innocent of these charges.  And I think Costas, though, was amazing in that interview.  He went after him, man. 
[01:48:00]  There was nothing soft about that interview.  Well, it sure isn't going to be a soft interview when it's the prosecution nailing him on the  stand like that because, wow.  But Costas, you think, being a sports guy or an NBC guy, would give him a few softball  questions?  Fucking brutal, man.  Yeah.  I was very...  I was like, man, Costas really went after him hard.  Yeah.  How must his lawyers have felt after Sandusky did that interview with Bob Costas?  Horrible.  He's putting him on the stand.  If that interview was good, he would not be on the stand. 
[01:48:30]  Because I think they wanted that because they want the jury to hear him denying it.  Yeah.  They want the jury to hear him going, no, I didn't do that without him testifying.  So they get it into evidence, however they do it.  He stunk so bad.  It's too damaging.  Yeah.  There's no way that those words can represent him in that trial.  And they may not have counted on the fucking amount of damaging testimony from these kids  or these guys now from when they were kids.  Yeah.  It's really hard to counteract grown men breaking down. 
[01:49:00]  It's like there's something inherently that you know.  Yeah.  That man is telling the truth.  It's like when you see a guy bawling and saying like, yeah, that guy fucking did what he did in the shower.  Bloodied my hiney.  Dude, that's really hard to pass off as a fake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a guy crying.  Because guys try not to cry and, you know.  And even though it's your job and everything, like how are you okay with yourself as that guy's defense?  Like how can you really muster up, you know, defending him with all your ability?  It is amazing that there's never been a case where a lawyer will not defend somebody. 
[01:49:30]  They always, no matter how despicable it is, they do have a right to legal counsel.  And people will represent the most disgusting fucking dirtbag.  Well, they have to.  In fairness to lawyers, if they don't provide an adequate defense, I think they'll be sanctioned or whatever by the judge.  The judge will move to have action taken against them.  If he feels that they're mailing it in, that's the vigorous defense.  You have to.  Or the judge will come after you because it undermines the whole legal system if you're not defending your client. 
[01:50:00]  You have to defend him.  It never looks good when your fucking lawyer quits.  Yeah.  It's like, well, we're leaving.  We have different ideologies.  You know, he's guilty and I don't want to defend him.  One time I was in a case, right, and my lawyer just freaked out and he told the judge, you're out of order.  This whole trial's out of order.  That's from a movie.  It never happened in real life.  It's not.  I was on trial.  You've never been on trial.  Fuck you. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, I have it.  No, you haven't.  Fuck you.  You're out of order.  The whole trial's out of order.  No, they didn't say that.  That didn't happen.  Chip trying to get into the conversation.  It happened.  Chip's way into the conversation is like he has to be cooler than anybody else.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got to have the best story.  Yeah, the best.  Sandusky is in fucking trouble, man.  He's going to be in trouble.  This son of a bitch is really.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope he testifies for it.  I can't wait to hear what he says. 
[01:51:00]  I'd love to hear the audio of it, but they don't do that where he's being in Pennsylvania,  I guess.  They do it in Florida.  They love to televise trials in Florida, but not in Pennsylvania.  Another thing.  Boy, did you, with the Twitter, did you see a Whitney Cummings fucking Twitter last night?  I did not.  Holy mother of God, someone hacked it.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, boy.  Can we see it?  It looked as though she really did not like black people. 
[01:51:30]  Oh.  Did you hack her Twitter?  Oh.  That's what people were saying.  And it just amazes me how dumb people are, because she was getting people that were retweeting  and saying, you're terrible, I can't believe you're such a racist.  Like, not knowing she was hacked.  What's it say?  That's not one of those guys.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Did they clean him up?  They might have cleaned him up.  But it's still got to be out there somewhere.  Yeah, I'm looking.  Like, why would Whitney Cummings do that? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, somebody fucking completely hacked her site and just dropping N-bombs.  Oh, yeah, that's not Whitney.  Fucking, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They really, really twisted it, though.  I've never seen such a great Twitter hack in my life.  Really?  Oh, because they were brutal.  Like, it went right from her, you know, hey, I'm just hanging out, having some dinner.  And then it's just like, oh, and she apparently hates black people. 
[01:52:30]  Whitney's Twitter account hacked.  Did it make the news?  Any of the news sites?  Yeah.  I did see that.  Yeah.  When I saw it last night, I was just like, oh, boy, somebody's got to fucking report on this.  There's got to be somewhere.  Does anybody...  Is there any callers that might know?  Retweets and stuff.  Probably some retweets.  Here we go.  There we go.  Oh, there it is.  Thank you.  Let's see some of these.  Whitney Cummings. 
[01:53:00]  Let's see.  What's tweets?  Uh.  Oh.  But wait.  It's...  She's saying...  There's a couple of...  I-L-Y.  I-L...  What does that mean?  And then there's one.  Are niggers considered class?  All in capital letters.  Yeah.  And then...  Oh, it's the hashtags.  Yeah.  Raztab.  Raztab, whoever that is.  And then the hashtags are thankniggers and then clanvrclan. 
[01:53:30]  I don't know what that...  It's a connection to something.  Yeah, that's a website.  Okay.  And Brock...  These are not really good because they're not...  No, they're not really going off, but...  Eh.  What are you going to do?  Well, I'm not blaming you.  I'm just saying that this is whatever is on the page.  Yeah.  She, um...  That's...  You know, obviously that's not her.  She was hacked.  And then I finally saw one that said, uh...  Oh, I've been hacked.  So she got it back.  How'd she get it back?  I don't know.  They took over...  They replaced our picture with, like, their little emblem for hacking. 
[01:54:00]  It's like one of those little hacker organizations.  You must have to contact Twitter and then...  Help.  How do you contact them?  She's verifying the celebrities.  You have to send them a letter in triplicate.  It's got to be written and mailed.  Regular posts.  You're verified, right?  That would take a long...  I am verified, yeah.  I'm not verified.  You're not?  No.  It seems like a big pain in the ass to do.  Dane Cook helped me.  I want to get verified.  For what?  Who would pretend to be you? 
[01:54:30]  There's been not Sam impersonators.  There haven't been.  Yes, there have.  I really honestly don't...  There's too much work behind it.  What do you have to do?  You got to, like, write in?  What, do you got to write them a letter?  I don't know.  I think you got to know somebody, like a mason.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, you got, like...  Why are you going to be making bricks?  See.  See.  Freemason.  See.  No.  It's not mason.  If you...  Oh, is that her regular tweets?  Or are those the hacked ones? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, that's the regular ones, yeah.  Yeah.  People are saying that her hacked tweets are more interesting than her regular tweets.  Some of the people on the...  Because they're horribly racist.  I don't follow Whitney, so I don't know what she does on Twitter, but...  Yeah.  I know it ain't that.  Some of the people on the phones are saying that NBC edited it out because it wouldn't have  been a fair trial.  On the what?  On the phones.  Oh.  Yeah, we have phone callers.  Let's grab one.  Oh, my God.  Okay, go to Joe.  Here we go.  You want to go to Joe and I?  I wondered if that was true, but I don't think that they worry about that. 
[01:55:30]  Let's go.  This is the caller test.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe from Maryland.  Hi, Joe.  I was just playing devil's ad because that might be a possibility that NBC edited that  out because there'd be no possibility if you get a fair trial and then handed it over  to the prosecution that, hey, there's an admission care of guilt.  I think...  I know what you're saying, but I don't think NBC News would give a shit about that.  They'd never care about that.  You're probably right.  You're probably right.  The press doesn't have to edit themselves because it might taint a jury. 
[01:56:00]  They never do that.  It might be a legal department...  But you're playing the devil's advocate.  Ah!  Yeah!  Put lifts on the little boys so they look like teenagers.  Some lifts.  But there might be a legal department above their news department that says, hey, you  can't air this.  No.  Yes, you can't.  No.  If somebody goes on TV and admits guilt, you're allowed...  I mean, there's...  There's no reason.  The press doesn't have to edit themselves in any way, shape, or form because they think 
[01:56:30]  it might be a biased trial.  Well, yeah.  Oh, well.  That wouldn't be NBC's fault.  That would be his fault for saying it.  Stupid caller, but not a completely off...  It wasn't annoying.  It didn't make me mad taking that call.  It wasn't a bad caller, but he was totally wrong.  Yeah.  Let's try Eric in Jersey, since we're just pounding the phones now.  Okay.  Hey, Eric?  Yeah, good morning.  What's up?  What do you got today?  Well, this is the second time that they screwed up. 
[01:57:00]  They screwed up with the Zimmerman, too.  You know, when he was on line with the 911 operator?  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't hear that.  Really?  Come on, Anthony.  Where have you been?  You know what?  He's saying about the editing.  They fucked up the edit.  Yeah.  With that, and they did fuck up, and they edited this wrong, too.  And MSNBC just edited something with Mitt Romney talking.  The Romney talking about Wawa, and, you know, Wawa.  Do we have that?  I didn't hear that. 
[01:57:30]  But that's all under the umbrella of NBC News.  Yes.  Man, they better stop fucking around with that stuff.  They have no credibility at all right now.  They're getting a terrible reputation.  They're a completely horrible, biased fucking news organization.  Yeah, the Romney thing, if you remember, he was talking about Wawa, and he's mentioning  some things, and it kind of sounds silly, and they wanted him to sound out of touch, because  he was talking about you're pressing buttons, and the sandwich comes out, and it's amazing,  and then they stopped it, but he was trying to use it as an example of technology and innovation 
[01:58:00]  and the private sector and how they're doing things.  And he messed up one part, because he did say a touch-tone keypad at one point, which  does make him sound like an ass, but I get, like, when you just look at that clip out  of context, and then the whole thing in context, you give him the pass, you go, okay, he was  just talking.  He had a reason to talk about it because of what he said after it, but when you take  what he said after it and cut it out, he just sounds like he's babbling on about some 
[01:58:30]  wacky, new, modern buzzers and lights things he saw.  Like he's never been to a supermarket before.  Yes, yes, and that's what they did.  What is the, let's hear the, do we have both versions?  Yes, this is the MSNBC version.  I get the feeling, take a look at this, that Mitt Romney has not been in too many, too  many wah-wahs along the roadside in Pennsylvania.  I was at wah-wahs.  I wanted to order a sandwich.  You press a little touch-tone keypad, all right?  You just touch that, and you know, the sandwich comes up, you touch this, touch this, touch this, 
[01:59:00]  go pay the cashier, there's your sandwich.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  So they cut it off, and then they just start laughing, but, you know, when you cut it off  like that, you take away what he was trying to get across.  And I fell for it.  I saw that clip yesterday, and I was like, oh, what an asshole.  What an idiot.  Isn't that amazing?  It was awful like a dolt.  At least people know Fox is slanted one way.  Everybody knows that, but he mentioned MSNBC, and people go, oh, it's on Fox, it's on Fox. 
[01:59:30]  Let's hear the original version.  This is the full version.  This is taped on it.  It's a much longer, by the way.  I know.  So I cut it down, but it's taped on it.  Oh, you edited it.  Oh, edited it by Sam Roberts.  So it's what Sam did to it.  Just the heads and tails.  I was at Wawa's.  I wanted to order a sandwich.  You press a little touch-tone keypad, all right?  You just touch that, and, you know, that sandwich comes in.  You touch this, touch this, touch this.  Go pay the cashier.  There's your sandwich.  It's amazing.  People in the private sector have learned how to compete. 
[02:00:00]  It's time to bring some competition to the federal government and get it small and have  to respond to the customers, which are you.  I've got to interrupt.  It wasn't a good editing job, Sam, because he used that Wawa thing as a point of how there's  a lot of different sandwich, there's a lot of different places to get a sandwich.  And so what sets maybe Wawa apart from everybody else is that they innovated, they took it to  the next level, and they made it a lot easier for the customer.  And he was trying to make a point about just consolidating and trying to make something 
[02:00:30]  easy when a lot of the departments of government make things difficult.  And he was just trying to boil it down to, like, if we can get it this easy in a fucking  sandwich shop, how come we can't get it this easy in government?  And that's the point he was trying to make.  But when you cut that off.  And then it just got condensed down to, Wawa's cool, crazy, right?  I like the buttons.  So they edited Sandusky, they fucking purposely edited Zimmerman to make him look like a racist,  and then MSNBC purposely edits Mitt Romney to make him look stupid.  Amazing, right?  It's fucking embarrassing.  That's embarrassing.  It really is. 
[02:01:00]  Terrible.  But they continue to do it.  I don't know why they have any credibility as NBC News.  Or why they're allowed to get the same freedoms that news organizations are allowed to get.  You can't even say anything about MSNBC doing this, because the minute that you bring up,  well, look what they just did, and then they'll go, yeah, well, Fox does it too.  Fox.  And for some reason, that makes it okay.  So it's like, okay, well, let's pretend like it didn't happen simply because they all do it.  Yeah.  And I've seen a fuck of a lot more liberals being able to come on and give their point  of view on Fox than I have conservatives being able to give their point of view on MSNBC. 
[02:01:30]  It really is amazing.  What are you going to do?  Hey, I'm going to visit the boys' room.  I'll go with you, because I got a piss.  Oh, let's play a game.  Oh, what are we going to play?  Where's your junk?  Let's all touch our cocks.  I like to sit on the toilet when I know Anthony's going in, and then hopefully he's like a woozy,  and he doesn't even know, and he accidentally sits down and shits on my cock.  Remember when that happened?  Yeah, a couple times. 
[02:02:00]  All right, you asses.  Be right back.  The Opie Anthony Channel.  Serious XM.  Laugh your tears away.  Laugh your tears away.  Laugh your tears away.

[02:05:00]  Take your medication  For your killer child  Laugh your tears away  Laugh your tears away  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Ooh, what's this?  Travis Gambino. 
[02:05:30]  Oh.  Do you know what we forgot before?  Great song.  Okay.  No, wait, I never forget to touch dicks.  I just make myself late.  It's like a treat I'm looking forward to.  A treat.  There was a texting case.  Somebody reminded me on Twitter in Jersey of somebody who was Twittering her boyfriend  and he killed somebody texting.  Or no, they injured the person.  Like they lost a leg or something.  So they tried to sue the gun, obviously the driver, and the person texting.  Well, you knew, which you can't do.  You just can't.  Oh, my God.  How many fucking, yeah, degrees of separation you got to go through? 
[02:06:00]  That was there.  They can't sue me.  Wow.  Because you could say, well, I thought he was going to check the text after he got there.  Yeah.  No matter what, you just can't sue someone.  It's not your fucking problem.  No.  Yeah.  I've been guilty of texting while I'm driving around.  Yeah, me too.  I don't like...  Both of you got to stop.  I worry about you.  It's scary.  It is scary when you do it.  Yeah.  You're like, I don't want to take my eyes off the road too long.  Well, you probably drive at a reasonable speed when you do it, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  You know, it's the right lane.  I'm doing the 30 miles an hour.  Good, good, good.  Uh, making sure I'm not tailgating.  Good.  Sure, sure.  Please.  Yeah, I'd probably prefer if you didn't, if you got off your phone while driving.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not, uh...  I really don't do it much.  Tweeting...  It only takes once, doesn't it?  It's true.  There's no reason to tweet when you're driving.  No.  Texting, sometimes you have to.  No, you don't.  I've, uh...  I've incorporated a lot of shortcuts now into my iPhone. 
[02:07:00]  I figured out the shortcut thing where all you do is type in one or two letters and a whole fucking statement will come out.  Like, it'll be like, hey, I'm driving.  I'll get in touch with you later.  And I could do that just like DD.  I have that set for like DD.  It's because drive.  So you just go DD and that whole thing comes up and then you just hit send.  Oh, can you do that?  Yes!  You can hit shortcuts by two letters?  Setting up your shortcuts.  Yeah, two letters, one letter, it doesn't matter.  Like, like fuck for some reason. 
[02:07:30]  It always tries to correct fuck in my phone.  So I made fuck the shortcut for fuck.  So that when I put in fuck, it automatically keeps fuck and doesn't change it to something else.  Other things like NP for no problem.  Oh.  I would always put in NP and it would turn to NO.  Something people.  Oh, yeah.  It would turn to NO.  So now I have NP as NP.  So when you do it, it just comes up NP.  Why not just have NP as no problem so it says it? 
[02:08:00]  Well, because NP is kind of the cool way to say no problem.  What kind of a douchebag uses an abbreviation for an abbreviation?  I do.  I never knew how to use shortcuts.  That's fucking pretty interesting.  They're so handy.  Especially, like I said, when you're driving.  If you want to get something really quick.  You still, I mean, what are you getting while you're driving that you really need to respond to immediately?  Sometimes, let's say, for some reason, Club Soda Kenny is texting me when I'm on my way in with something. 
[02:08:30]  And I have to say, like, okay, got it.  I'm driving, seeing a few.  He should be calling you if he's concerned with your safety.  Because then you could just, do you have something in your car you could hit?  Yeah.  Like, you know, like a...  No.  I have a shortcut, though, that has a bunch of things like this.  It goes, I'll be there in 5.  I'll be there in 10.  I'll be there in 15.  I have a few of those.  And then you just, like, put in B1-5, and then it'll say, I'll be there in 15. 
[02:09:00]  So that way, if I'm running a little late, I let Kenny know I'll be there in 5.  I'll be there in 10.  I'll be there in 15.  We understand why you'd use...  Yeah.  I'm just going on and on.  Why am I just going on and on and on?  Fuck.  Shut up.  It's called a shortcut.  How about a shortcut to this conversation, Anthony?  Jesus Christ, what an idiot.  No, I don't mind.  I didn't mind you saying B15 and B20.  But first of all, you listed three, and then you're like, and then there's going to be  time if I'm running late, so we understand why you would tell someone you're running late.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:30]  What's wrong with me?  Oh, I'm thrown from that bathroom visit.  What happened?  You don't want to know.  No.  Jimmy shuts the lights out on me.  By accident.  No, it was an accident.  It was such a force of habit.  I forgot Anthony was doodying.  No.  You always shut the lights, right?  Every time you're in the bathroom, any bathroom with Jimmy, when he leaves, he will shut the  lights, and now you're just sitting in the dark.  Was it pitch dark?  It was pitch black in there, and then somebody, because there's no windows, because then somebody 
[02:10:00]  walks in, and you hear them go, where are the lights out?  Like, they talk to themselves, where are the lights out?  And they get their junk grabbed.  Yeah, yeah, and then I grab their penis.  They say, why are the lights out?  And then you're shitting alone.  You're shitting alone in the corner.  They probably think you're jerking off.  Thanks, Jimmy.  That's funny.  They probably think you're cranking over there.  That's the guy who cranks his dick.  I'm yanking it.  They look at your shoes.  They're like, that's the guy who fucking pulls his pud in the bathroom. 
[02:10:30]  I don't like looking at people seeing your shoes and everything like that.  Because you don't want them to know that you're the man making that stink in the fucking  in the bathroom.  Well, that's true.  So I saw somebody taking a dump in there the other day, and they have, of course, their  pants down.  And their ID tag is just hanging on the floor, so it's better than even shoes.  You're just like, ah, look at that.  Bill Williams is taking a shit.  His picture, he's just like, ah.  Listen to Phil Buttons. 
[02:11:00]  Nothing makes that resonant sound than a nice toilet bowl.  It really does make that echoey...  Some people really have no shame here, too.  No.  I don't care.  I don't...  It's not like...  I mean, I guess I'm from the mentality that I guess I should be trying to make as much  noise when I'm shitting in there as possible.  But I don't, for whatever reason.  I just try to keep it classy.  But other people, they'll just run in there, and they will just open their assholes up at  fucking full volume, and I just never understood that. 
[02:11:30]  Like, you know I'm in there, or you don't care, obviously.  What are you talking about?  You fart in the office all morning long.  Yeah, I fart, but shitting is different.  Shitting is different.  You're making noise at your desk all morning.  Poo-poo is different.  Oh, man.  Danny farts all morning.  Yeah, that's true.  So loudly.  That's true.  Voluminously.  So you don't think Blurr's argument about the...  No, dude, it's different, dude.  What do you mean keep it classy and recognizing other people there?  Listening to someone's fart is funny.  No, it's not. 
[02:12:00]  Listening to someone take a shit is weird.  That's why Travis and me both started ignoring him, because we were hoping it would just stop.  And you're amongst friends when you do it in the office, and it's just all strangers  in the bathroom.  No, he's amongst people who used to be his friends until he insisted on farting all morning.  Yeah, you know what?  That might have something to do with it, too.  Like, if I knew you were in the bathroom, I would shit louder.  Oh, okay.  I don't like the moan, either, in there.  You hear, like, pfft, oh.  Oh, really?  Are you getting that much pleasure out of it?  I saw a guy run in the other day, and he ran in, like, no time for fucking malarkey. 
[02:12:30]  No time for love, Dr. Jones.  The door closed.  Was it E-rock?  And you hear...  No.  And you hear the fucking...  The hurried shuffle of the bell.  Buckle, buckle, buckle.  Clang, clang.  And he's tap dancing at the same time.  And fucking literally, you knew there was no time for paper placement.  Just buckle.  And I'm like, he must have been dying for a commercial break.  Dude, the fastest shitter I've ever seen in my life was Eastside Dave.  Oh, man.  Back at XM.  And I knew it was him.  It was his pants.  Because he always wore Converse All-Stars, and he would pull the laces so tight that you 
[02:13:00]  couldn't even see...  It looked like a scar.  It didn't even look like shoelaces.  And I'm in the bathroom.  And like, before...  And the time it took for one decent-sized log to just come out of my ass and drop into  the...  He had his pants down, he shat and wiped, and he was out.  Dave was also...  It was 10 seconds.  It was also a dead giveaway when Dave was in the stall on 57th Street, because he was  the only one that brought a porno magazine and lube into the stall with him.  Really?  Always.  Was he jacking off in the... 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  He always used to take those little bottles of lube that they would send us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He used to come into our office, get a little bottle of lube in one of the magazines that  they would send to Steve, and he'd go into the bathroom and he'd jerk off.  Really?  Yeah, always.  Sometimes he'd go down to the third floor because he thought the bathrooms were more  comfortable.  The work jerk is for the young.  Yeah, Dave used to work jerk all day long.  Work jerk.  How would you get down to the third floor bathroom?  I never knew about that.  You'd just take the stairs, you'd go down, and the doors go all the way to the floor in  that bathroom.  And he'd be holding the magazine and lube? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, because the doors go all the way to the floor, the stall doors.  Oh, oh, very proud.  In that bathroom.  Oh, I wish I would.  It's amazing.  I'm actually bummed.  I didn't know about that, so I could go shit there right now.  Is it the third floor?  That's where Eric used to get his snacks, right?  Yeah, and then they used to set out tables, I guess little buffet-type tables of fruit platters  and things like that, and cookies and stuff.  And Eric used to go down to the third floor, and he used to steal their lunch meats.  I never knew that.  Yeah, it was one of those offices that they used for architects, but it was always a different 
[02:14:30]  group coming in from somewhere around the country, and they'd have a whole spread.  He would go down for his shit and come back with a sandwich.  This sounds fucking...  He's eating sandwiches and cookies and everything.  Oh, just a fucking amazing...  What a glutton.  Oh, he really is.  Just sniffing out food like a pig looking for truffles.  He said he's just a pig looking for lunch.  Oh, E-Rod.  Oh, I got it, Sam.  Did you hear it?  Danny called you a pig as an E-Rod. 
[02:15:00]  I was right there.  It was too easy.  But you did do it.  You called him a pig.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oink, oink.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Fat pig.  Oh, my God.  That's what you called him, I mean.  You wouldn't call him that, would you?  No, it's mean to just call him a big, fat pig.  Oh.  That's what Danny did.  That was mean.  I see what you're doing there.  That was mean.  I see what you're doing right there.  I didn't say that.  Huge, enormous, big, fat pig.  Yeah, that really is uncalled for.  Don't do it again, Danny.  Yeah, it's something about that seat there.  He said that yesterday.  Exactly.  That's still true.  How many times have you done the same joke? 
[02:15:30]  You laughed at him yesterday.  He's trying to get some of that.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Good morning, sexy.  Oh, I did that.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, it was when we came back from break.  Oh, what was his thing?  It was nothing.  He just had a bed on.  Someone's sloughing off.  I know, right?  Someone's on fucking vacation with Opie gone.  Opie actually was yesterday, and he said at the doctor's, he went to the doctor's, he  was in the waiting room, and he actually shit onto his balls.  Oh, man. 
[02:16:00]  Onto the back of his balls.  Shit onto the back of his balls?  That's the problem, right?  He's shitting everywhere?  Is that right?  He's been liquid shitting.  He has a parasite.  And, um...  She's E-Rock.  And it's just been nothing but, like, butterscotch-colored liquid shit.  Oh, wow.  Looks like he's wearing a butterscotch skirt.  Oh, that's brutal.  That's gross.  That is horrible.  Man, I could use some soupy.  Get some soup in a fucking boss.  What flavor?  You know what?  I'm tired of the fucking turkey chili. 
[02:16:30]  Of course you are.  And I'm kind of tired of that fucking chicken noodle.  Yeah, why wouldn't you be?  What else do they got?  Vegetable cum?  Vegetable cum.  They have a toenail medley.  I like the fucking...  Everybody's talking about food.  I hit that shit real quick.  That looks really good, man.  I'm on my cup of munchkins.  Cup of munchkins.  We have a cup of munchkins.  Damn.  Would you like a munchkin, James?  I have a raging heart on right now.  Really?  I'd love to shove it in that munchkin thing.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts? 
[02:17:00]  Do it.  Sure, I'll just put more donuts.  I'd love to see your dick in these donuts.  They're great.  What other kind of flavored soups do they have, Kenny?  Do you want me to call the hotline with the choices?  Why don't you do that?  I would love to know.  Because I've just, since I've been here, it's been turkey chili and chicken noodle.  Yeah, pull your pants up, Pyro.  I might be missing some lobster bisque, some mulligatani, some jambalaya.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at his pants.  They're horrible. 
[02:17:30]  So if he's kind of staring down Jim like Jesse Ventura did in the doorway, then he'll say,  My pants, huh?  That would be a little dangerous.  Your clothes are huge.  Yeah.  You have big clothes.  But you're a big guy.  I know that.  He has to look at himself to confirm that he's huge.  It is indeed a big shirt.  I am big.  Is this on, Sam?  It's on.  It's on.  I buy big attire to downplay my muscularity.  Well, it's just have to do with your tires. 
[02:18:00]  Fucking home run.  Double bias ply.  What's that?  Tire.  Oh, that's good.  I'm going to get your soup.  All right, Kenny.  Thanks, man.  Do you really want to downplay your muscularity?  Yes.  Why?  Yeah, you really do wear loose-fitting clothing.  Why?  I don't have to wear tight clothing.  Can you fight better in loose clothing?  Yes.  Yeah?  Move faster?  Yes.  Don't have to worry about ripping your pants and having the guy go,  Ah-ha.  And you like people to underestimate you?  Oh, like maybe you're not as fit as you are. 
[02:18:30]  No, I never underestimate anybody.  But they might underestimate you.  I don't know.  It's a good tactic.  And you like cheap suits.  Yes.  You like it?  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  I'm seeing some Master Poe videos.  Ha-ha.  He wore loose clothes.  Yeah, there's some muscularity.  Is that really good, this video?  It's a nunchucks?  Ha-ha.  What is he spinning?  It's not nunchucks, is it?  Yeah.  I think it's just a stick.  I think it's just a stick.  It's a pointer.  It's like what the, uh... 
[02:19:00]  It's a skewer.  It's what the conductor has.  It's what the conductor has.  He's dancing.  He has sunglasses on.  Opera.  He was great.  That was nunchucks.  No, now he's got two sticks.  Those are nunchucks, aren't they?  I think they're actually size.  They're nunchucks.  You can't tell, because he's moving so fast.  Those are nunchucks.  Are they?  He was good, though.  But I don't see that they're connected by a chain or anything.  I guarantee you they are.  They just look like solid sticks, though.  They look like size to me.  Wait.  I think they're just solid sticks.  Yes.  Are they?  He was an expert swordsman. 
[02:19:30]  I'm actually wrong.  They wore sticks.  Ah, swords.  Man, was he a...  I've never seen somebody make more of his own sound effects than this guy.  The only person that made more sound effects for himself is probably Hulk Hogan.  Deuce.  He would smack himself to make, like, impact sounds and stomp his feet on the floor.  It was ridiculous.  Why is, in this video, I'm watching Master Poe just beating himself up with these things?  Somehow this is a demonstration.  I'm not sure how, but this is somehow a fight demo.  He's just hitting himself with the thing and jumping around a lot in front of a... 
[02:20:00]  Oh, he just did a roll.  I never understood this, and I never understood where he would show you moves like this,  but he would have to show you in very controlled environments.  Like, oh, let me show you all these moves that I can do if the other person is moving  in slow motion, letting me do them.  To me, that's not a fucking...  I don't see how that's a demonstration of anything.  And he's in, like, fast motion.  He's just like he's...  It's like he's curly going...  It's like...  It's like, if I could stop time, this is how I'd beat you up. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Yeah, you wouldn't be able to move, but I can move in fast motion.  I do think he could fight, though, man.  I think...  I like that.  Yeah, but you know what, Jim?  I've never seen one single video of him doing anything.  Oh, fighting.  Well, Mars said he was good, though.  Mars said he knew what he was doing.  I'd like to see...  I'd like to know if Mars ever actually saw him fight.  Oh, shit.  Not sparring, not doing that fake, I'm slapping my fucking jacket bullshit.  But actually, actually fight.  It's like fast motion Macarena he would do.  Where's Mars?  Mars always vouched for him. 
[02:21:00]  I'm out today.  They were good friends.  Mars is out today, I think.  Where is he?  He's probably having fucking anal fissures sewn shut.  He's fucking Travis, who's also...  Yeah, they're fucking...  Gay lovers.  Damn, that's a good anus.  Yeah.  Well, I want to hear this Rodney King fiancé 911 call.  Oh, God, yeah.  This is, as they say, chilling.  Yeah.  It's chilling.  There are still people suspicious of her, though.  Yes. 
[02:21:30]  The police are investigating it, but they say that it doesn't seem to be a sign of foul play,  but a lot of his friends are saying foul play.  Some people were saying that he was going to leave his fiancé.  Really?  That was the plan.  She may have caught wind of that.  Oh, and shoved him in the pool or something?  People are saying.  Cracked him over the head?  But he apparently was a swimmer.  He swam at night.  Maybe he was drunk.  Maybe she gave him succinylcholine like the Exorcist 3.  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  And then shoved him in the pool.  Uh-huh.  And she didn't go into the pool to get him out.  No.  She said she tried to wake him up with a shovel.  You'll hear that in the call.  I guess she grabbed a shovel and poked at him when he's just at the bottom of the pool.  I don't think when you're at the bottom of the pool you're asleep.  It's not like you wake up and go like...  Yawning and bubbles are coming out.  Yeah.  Under the sea. 
[02:22:30]  Like I'm doing a Little Mermaid reference.  Love it.  Yeah, let's hear it, man.  Yeah, let's hear this 911 call.  Please.  Oh, my God.  Is he breathing?  Hope not.  Oh, he's got the bottom of the swimming pool.  He's not having doing stuff to try to wake him up.  Rodney Blakey, he's at the bottom of the swimming pool.  Please hurry up.  Please, please, please.  What can you hear, you in, ma'am? 
[02:23:00]  I'm out of California.  Hurry up.  Please, please, please.  You're f***ing out of California.  Oh, my God, please.  It's hot.  What is the phone number you're calling from?  I'm calling from f***ing three-hundred, please.  He's not knowing why I'm trying to wake him up and I'm jumping in the swimming pool.  This is all my father's family.  Because I don't know how to swim.  She just said that.  She was like, I haven't jumped in the pool because I don't know how to swim.  It's her house and her pool, apparently. 
[02:23:30]  And Rodney King was over there.  And it's so odd, the thought of having a pool and not being able to swim.  It's like having a bear trap in your backyard.  Why the f*** would you have this dangerous thing, this pool of water that you can't f***ing go in?  Maybe to shoot music videos like MC Hammer's.  Oh, with his big dick.  There's a big dick in the bottom of the pool.  I'm so glad I got to turn you guys on to MC Hammer's big fat dick.  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[02:24:00]  His big f***ing shaking dick.  Yeah, and there's f***ing leopard skin underpants.  That looked great.  It was like a pant leg for it.  That dick has been making me laugh for, well, I don't know, 18 years.  I'm glad to share it with you guys.  That's an amazing dick.  You hear the rest of this call here in 911.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, hurry up!  Hurry up!  I've got to call my mom.  I called her mom.  This is crazy. 
[02:24:30]  Ma'am, ma'am, how are you?  This is cray!  Come on, hurry up, please!  What?  Please, hurry up, please.  Oh, my God!  It's not like they're stopping at f***ing McDonald's.  How old is he?  I don't know, way.  How old is he?  Rodney King, the guy that got beat by the Pauline.  Oh!  I think how old is he?  Isn't that odd?  Hold on.  Isn't that odd that she had to say that?  I think she said, who is he?  I thought that she thinks the operator said, who is he? 
[02:25:00]  It's, it's, yeah, she said, uh, how old is he?  But I think she said, like, who is he?  But why would you just go, it's Rodney King?  She's just panicking.  She's like, yeah, I'm trying to figure out why she's not being rational.  She's looking at her fiancé at the bottom of a pool.  Yeah, why isn't she, uh, yeah.  She's trying to get him out with a shovel.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think Club Soda Kenny's on with a soup update.  Oh, a soup update?  Let's hear, let's hear.  They won't put him on hold.  Oh, why won't they put him on hold?  Talking to him in the other room. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, what is it?  What does he have to say?  Nothing.  Hello?  I have the soup choices.  Oh, okay.  Hi, Kenny.  Thank you so much.  What are the choices?  What are your soups today?  Well, if you don't want turkey chili or you don't want chicken noodle, the only other two choices are...  Don't say, don't say split pea.  Tuscan grilled vegetable and chicken and eggplant and bean.  And you're a cantaloupe.  Oh!  Tuscan-y? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Tuscan what?  Tuscan grilled vegetable.  Tuscan grilled vegetable soup.  What's that from Elephant Tusks?  You know what?  Yeah.  I'm going to try that.  Okay, coming right up.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  Oh, Tuscan Raider soup.  Oh, yeah.  See, it's Star Wars.  Yeah.  He's not here yet, right?  No.  Not Chet.  Um, oh, back to, uh, the audio. 
[02:26:30]  Okay, how old is he?  He's 47 years old.  He's not moving.  He's at the bottom of the swimming pool.  I don't know.  I was sleeping.  Is he out now?  What?  Is he still in the pool?  Yes!  I was sleeping.  I was sleeping.  I heard something fall like the table.  And then I'm a fellow.  And then I went to find him.  He's at the bottom of the swimming pool.  He's still there.  Please hurry up.  They're coming.  They're already coming.  Oh, my God.  Oh, sick. 
[02:27:00]  Are you able to go in the pool and get him?  No, I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  He's at the bottom.  I'm going to open the door.  Oh, my God.  She can't get him.  Hurry up, please.  It's fucked up.  Oh, my God.  They're coming as quick as they can.  They're coming to get him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Ma'am, is there anybody in the pool to get him? 
[02:27:30]  No.  How can I get him?  He's like, oh, my God.  He's like, oh, my God.  I'm trying to wake him up.  He's just floating at the bottom of the pool.  Oh, my God.  How about you jump in?  How about you jump in?  You, like, lock his arm, and then you kind of just move your arms and legs until you get  to the shallow end.  That's like jumping into a pit of fire for most people.  Jesus.  For most people. 
[02:28:00]  You know, whoever can't swim.  Jesus.  If she's telling the truth, like, if she really is just panicking, that's horrible.  You can feel the mounting panic.  Yes.  I'll get him out.  Because you know.  Every second he's down there, you're thinking, like, there's no, he's dead.  Was he dead when they pulled him out?  He's dead already.  I think so.  Bones.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They pulled him out.  I mean, please.  I'm going to run to pee real quick.  He's been at the bottom of the fucking pool for like 20 minutes.  He was down there.  Like your adrenaline would just kick in, and you'd just jump in and learn how to swim right 
[02:28:30]  then.  Isn't that tough?  Yeah.  Like some kind of heroic move.  She's watched people swim.  And that wasn't a big pool.  Like, what was the deepest it could possibly have been?  It couldn't have been that deep.  Maybe eight feet at most.  At most.  And.  Because, I mean, you can't have a.  I mean, that would be some like in.  What do they call that?  A grade or whatever that the pool is on when it goes down.  Because if it's so small, you can't go from like walking in on the stair part to 12 feet 
[02:29:00]  in the span of six or eight feet.  Giant fucking fall off.  Yeah.  It's probably like, and it's probably, you know, a matter of feet of dragging him before  you're able to put your head back above water.  Yeah.  Because it's shallow, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She, she really was panicky.  She was totally panicky.  Didn't understand that she should probably jump in.  Yeah.  Try to get his head above the water.  You can't just say, please hurry, please hurry.  I hit him with a shovel and it didn't work.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  She fucking poked him with a shovel to try to get him awake.  Man, that's fucking panicky.  Any more of that left?  Yeah.  What's your life when he's at the bottom?  I threw a shovel and something to wake him up and he's not moving.  He's jumping in the bottom.  I'm going to be a fool.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  It's crazy.  I'll tell you exactly what to do next. 
[02:30:00]  Do not go to the water unless it's safe to do.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  No.  I understand.  They're coming to you, ma'am.  They're coming to a cooking camp.  This is crazy.  They're coming to you, ma'am.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's losing it now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think she realizes now.  Oh, my God.  They're coming to you.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  She knows now. 
[02:30:30]  It's too late.  Oh, my God.  Please, this is crazy.  I've got to call my mom.  I've got to call her mom.  Please, I've got to call my mom.  I've got to call her family.  I don't know.  I'm going to get to the paramedics.  Get there, okay?  I don't know.  I can't.  She's losing it.  It's over, Johnny.  She knows that he's been there too long.  You're coming now. 
[02:31:00]  I don't want to still laugh.  I want to go with the laborator.  Look at the bottom of the pool.  Officer, please.  I want to go with the laborator.  I want to go with the laborator.  Officer, please.  He jumps in, starts hitting him. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, she was happy to see the cops then, huh?  They showed up.  Officer, please.  Did they just jump in and grab him, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They jumped right in, grabbed him.  Brought him up.  Man, she must feel pretty terrible that she wasn't able to go in there.  That's got to be very frustrating to look and see somebody.  You have a fucking pool.  You have a pool.  You've got to be able to swim.  Yeah.  It literally is like fucking, you know, you have something really dangerous in your yard. 
[02:32:00]  Just it's there and it's horribly dangerous.  It's like having a bear trap in your yard.  I said that.  I just wanted to steal it.  Yeah, well, that was the call.  And, of course, they couldn't revive him.  Wow.  He was down there for quite some time.  They said he was a swimmer.  So, it's like, maybe something else.  Maybe a heart attack.  They'll figure it out, whatever it is.  It might have been a heart attack.  She said that she heard some kind of banging sound, like on the table.  Like a banging sound on the table and then heard a splash. 
[02:32:30]  And then she went out.  So, maybe he had a heart attack and fell in the pool.  Or maybe somebody smashed his head against the fucking table and threw him in the pool.  How close was he to the fucking, how close was he to the table that he would hit it and then fall in the pool?  3.5 meters.  Oh, that would make perfect sense.  I'm glad you had that measurement handy.  Oh, I did.  Because I didn't know.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but you can hear her panic, man.  That's fucking frustrating.  You can hear.  At the beginning of the call, I don't think it's sunk in yet. 
[02:33:00]  Well, Rodney did.  I don't think it's sunk in.  I'll tell you, that, like, he was, he's dead, you know?  And then, as the call went on, your rest in pool tweet was very funny.  R.I.P.  Rest in pool.  That made me laugh very hard, even though it was fucking horrible.  And the old, can't we all get along snorkel?  Poor fella.  Yeah.  But, um, yeah, she, she, uh, I think by the end of the call, she realized, hey, a human 
[02:33:30]  is down there that long.  There ain't no fucking way he's, uh.  How long was he there?  A few minutes, right?  Even for the length of the call.  I mean, that call was four and a half minutes.  Four and a half minutes underwater?  You're done.  Well, I don't know.  David Blaine did it for, like, two weeks or something.  Oh, did he?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, let me tell you something about David Blaine.  I don't mention his name.  He's magic.  He's not magic.  He's not really magic.  He just does illusions.  Illusions.  I was watching, um, that, uh, show that, uh, Let's Fuck Over the Magicians, it's called, 
[02:34:00]  I think.  Oh, the Magicians' Greatest Secrets Finally Revealed.  Finally Revealed.  Those are those old, they were, like, Fox specials years ago, and now they replay them  on Channel 9.  Those things stink.  Yeah.  Are they mad?  The Mass Magician, he reveals all.  They'll show you magic tricks that you never knew or gave a shit about, and then they  show you how they're done, and it's like, wow, cool.  I've been watching, uh, there was, like, kind of a marathon last night, so I watched maybe  three episodes, and, um, they're all the same.  Like, they're all the same basic trick that they expose. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  It's like, okay, here's one where the woman has to slide into a little space in a box that  you don't think is there, because it's an illusion.  And then there's the big one where they make a giant dump truck disappear right before  your eyes, but they pull a curtain up around it.  They could have just called the show Trap Doors and Mirrors.  Right.  That's every...  Call it Trap Doors and Mirrors, because that's every single trick.  How do they do the fucking dump truck disappear?  It's amazing.  They had a dump truck, and it's surrounded by a fence. 
[02:35:00]  Can we see it?  Yeah.  I would like to see that.  Because I'm a boy who loves magic, and I always wonder, how do they do it?  And so when I go to a magic show, which I do a lot...  Do you?  I'll, uh...  As soon as they start the trick, I'll be like, tell me how you do it!  And I'll clap loudly.  No, you won't.  Annoy them.  Gosh.  Unbelievable.  Now, what they do is, let's say there's a big dump truck, and there's a fence around 
[02:35:30]  the dump truck.  Sure.  So there's literally a...  There normally is a good dump truck, all the fence around it?  Very high, like a 12-foot high fence, and a gate.  And they lock the gate.  Why is there a gate around it?  I don't know, because the magician was in there, like, waving around the truck to  show there was no wires or anything.  And then they close the gate, lock it, the big lock.  Then they get a bunch of people, witnesses, that stand around the gate.  And then they drop a white curtain around the whole gate, right? 
[02:36:00]  And then the curtain lifts up a little bit, and they show the truck, right?  And then it goes back down, and he does a little more mumbo-jumbo.  And then the curtain lifts up a little bit again, and you realize, hey, I don't see any  tires or anything there.  What the fuck?  And then he goes, ah!  And the whole thing drops down the curtain, and everything's gone.  Here it is!  It's amazing.  Oh my god!  There's a masked magician!  Yes.  That's a big truck!  Yes, it's a giant truck. 
[02:36:30]  Those girls keep popping up right when he needs them.  He has no mask.  The narration is horrible, and it's the guy that was the chief inspector on X-Files.  Yeah.  All right, can we fast forward?  I don't need to see this asshole climbing on the truck.  We've established it's a truck.  Yeah, he goes into the window to show there's nothing with the steering and things like  that.  Oh, this stinks.  Time for the magic.  This guy's a total douche.  First, a group of spectators is invited to surround us. 
[02:37:00]  I like the episode when it was starting to run out of ratings, and they were like, on  this episode, the masked magician reveals his identity.  And he took off his mask, and it was just some guy you never even heard of in your life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah, who gives a fuck who he is?  It's like some black dude, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never heard of him.  It's like a black magician?  What?  Who's this guy?  Yeah.  Oh.  They're all standing around the truck.  Yeah.  Now, is this really outdoors or just supposed to be?  Uh, it, uh...  Go do it outdoors.  It looks like a soundstage.  Yeah, it's a soundstage.  The spectators take one last look...  The spectators, by the way, all in on it. 
[02:37:30]  Huh?  All in on it.  These tricks are only done on television.  Right.  You can never just do these.  The curtain falls.  Now the witnesses all join hands around.  Because you wouldn't hear the truck if it drove away?  Right.  Why are they holding hands?  It's making it tough for the magician to work his magic.  It's making it tough for the magician to work his magic.  Make this a little louder.  They're all holding hands around a white curtain.  This is awful.  A little more conjuring on the part of the magician.  Oh, he's conjuring. 
[02:38:00]  He's conjuring things up.  The curtain's raising.  I guess the only way out is up.  Oh, this magician stinks.  What's impressive?  Nothing.  They're holding hands around a curtain.  Nothing's impressive so far.  What's going on behind that sheet?  Trickery.  If you want the answers, just imagine how they feel.  So close.  Bored.  And yet so far.  This guy's horrible.  This show just sucked.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  The cage is sunk. 
[02:38:30]  65,000 pounds.  I don't see it.  I don't either.  Besides, nobody said anything about it.  It's about a floating truck.  Right.  That's true.  It's about what's happening here.  There's no sign of the vehicle underneath.  No.  But where is it?  I don't know.  I can see legs.  The floor is solid concrete, so don't look for any trap doors.  No.  That's true.  I thought a trap door swallowed up a giant truck.  I was looking for a hinge.  The suspense is killing me.  Me too.  Uh-huh.  All those lights aren't distracting either.  No.  Yet another magical wave.  And?  The curtain just fell. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Everything's gone.  Goodbye.  How'd the curtain fall perfectly into a rectangle?  It's amazing.  And they're running across this...  Wait.  I can't say that I missed the truck.  It's gone.  But it's gone without a trace.  Those dumb girls.  It's so simple.  Yeah.  It's good, right?  It's magical.  No, it's not magic.  Shut up.  It's a dumb, easy gag trick that has to be done on TV.  Where's the...  Where's the...  Is it camera tricks? 
[02:39:30]  Nope.  Oh, they're showing you.  How did the magician make this 65,000-pound truck?  So, they're showing you with the curtain around here?  Yes.  Then vanish in the blink of an eye?  Okay, they're just re-showing the trick?  He didn't.  He didn't.  Here's what really happened.  Oh, no.  When the trick begins, the magician gives us a tour of the massive truck.  Right.  Yes.  Yes, the truck is real, and it is very heavy.  We know.  Oh, thanks.  But the two lovely assistants aren't the only magical...  They have dicks.  ...hiding in the shadows.  Cleverly concealed in the truck's payload are stagehands. 
[02:40:00]  Ah!  They disassemble the truck and eat it.  No?  The magician climbs up onto the truck's cab and leaves his hand inside.  Whenever a magician goes out of his way to show you that there's nothing unusual going on,  there always is.  Ah!  The truck's driver is hiding inside.  Oh, there's a driver.  That's one way to avoid a speeding ticket.  Ha ha ha ha!  The magician exits the steel cage, the doors are closed, and the chain is padlocked.  Right.  It's legit. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  That door will not be opened again.  Why are there stagehands?  At least until the stagehands want to come out and go home.  Well, they have work to do.  Then the magician takes us on a walk around the cage.  Are they going to disappear?  Is it here?  It completely encloses the truck.  No!  He calls on the witness.  They pick it up and slowly tiptoe away with it.  Ha ha ha ha!  Deedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedleedle!  Like the flintstones.  Yeah.  As soon as they are hidden from view, the driver and stagehands spring into action.  Oh!  Sucking out of the truck. 
[02:41:00]  And moving into position around the perimeter of the cage.  Because they're loud.  Yeah, wouldn't they hear them?  But they're all in on it, so it doesn't matter.  Oh!  That's the gag.  Wait, this guy starts the truck up.  What a waste of time.  Yes.  Yes, but why?  Wait a minute, why?  Uh-huh. 
[02:41:30]  It takes no skill.  No.  This is stupid.  It's stupid, you're right.  It's retarded.  It appears to make the silk rise.  Inside the cage, the stagehands make their move.  Upon closer inspection, you can see that the entire cage is on wheels.  And it is actually welded to the back of the truck.  Ah!  Back that bitch up! 
[02:42:00]  Oh.  He forgets to take this off.  Oh shit, he's going backwards.  Okay.  It's actually hung from a steel frame supported by beams and lifted by the curtains.  Dude, the curtain's not even on the fucking steel cage.  And hung from the ceiling high above the truck.  See?  Okay.  When the curtain rises, it is actually lifting off and away from the cage.  Ah!  And the cage and truck to slip out the back.  And the cage behind the truck. 
[02:42:30]  This is actually different than I would have thought they did it.  Really?  What did you think?  Our phony witnesses move out of the way.  Yeah.  And the cage and truck.  If you're going to...  This is so stupid.  If everybody's going to be in on it, and you're witnesses and everything, why wouldn't  you just cut the camera?  I know!  And just drive the truck away.  If it's just for television, cut the camera, drive the truck away, go back to the shot and  go, I love it.  Because they needed...  I'm telling you, because they needed to make it more interesting.  This is why big trucks like this are only seen on TV and never in front of a real live audience. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  So...  What's the point?  What's the point?  You want to fool us on television?  Do it with special effects.  Yeah.  Just animate it.  Just do a cartoon.  Right.  CGI.  Yeah.  This is bullshit.  This is magic.  No, it's not, Chippa.  Yes, it is.  It's not magic, Chippa.  Because then it disappears from behind a thing.  I've seen this one.  The silk is released from the steel flame.  Oh, we don't need to see it again.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's what they do.  They just...  It's ponderous, this show.  Why would you do that?  I watched about three hours of that last night. 
[02:43:30]  Nobody would do that trick on TV.  I would.  It's a waste of time.  He did it.  They've shown the disappearing car, truck, horse, elephant trick.  And it's always that.  They always have where they just pull the curtain up, back it out.  It's never done in front of a live audience.  This is stupid.  And then there's the body double ones they use.  It uses a bloody double.  They had a set of hot blonde twins.  Yeah.  And this girl's in one cage.  And this is like supposed to be this transporting thing. 
[02:44:00]  So there's a girl in one cage and the magician's in the other.  Ah.  And they tie the girl up with a red fucking bandana.  Tie her arms up.  And then they lift up these curtains around the magician and the woman.  And the second it goes up, boom, the curtains come back down.  She's gone.  And she's now next to the magician fucking like 20 feet away.  Yeah, but the only problem is she has to kill her clone every night.  And doesn't know whether they have spoilers.  It's the great Danton.  Oh, no.  It's the great Danton. 
[02:44:30]  I'll be across the street at the Pantages.  A room full of dead wolverines.  Yes.  Dead wolverines and fucking fish tanks.  What a terrible show.  Yeah.  Yeah, horrible.  Chris Angel's show, like when he was doing the Mind Freak show.  Like you can't do.  Mind Freak?  What is it, 1985?  A magic series.  No.  Because you just run out of tricks.  Like I remember one, he was walking on water.  And it was a pool in Las Vegas.  And everybody was like, well, you know, obviously nobody's in on this. 
[02:45:00]  And he's really walking across the pool.  Yeah.  But you could clearly see that he had simply gotten a clear acrylic.  Yeah.  You know, board that he just put across it.  And their trick was that, you know, people were swimming under him while he was walking.  But they just went deep enough so they went under the bridge.  Oh, that's fucking...  Like it was obvious.  How do you mean it was obvious?  Like you could see that, like, his foot would make a little puddle.  And then there was obviously some kind of surface.  You could tell that something is underneath it.  You're a dick, dude. 
[02:45:30]  Why is that?  Fucking giving away his secrets.  Just blew up his spot.  You're just as big of an asshole as this guy.  I want to see that.  You're not even math.  You don't like the math magician, Danny?  No, he's an ass.  Why would he throw away people's livelihoods like that?  Math magician.  That's how Christ did it.  Yeah.  Revealed.  With a plexiglass.  Yeah.  Holy plexiglass.  When I was a kid, they did this.  But they did Pro Wrestling's Greatest Secrets Finally Revealed.  Oh.  And it was the worst show ever.  They'd be like, did you know the old women that they beat up in the crowd are actually plants? 
[02:46:00]  Wow.  And I'm like 13.  And I was like, yeah, I kind of figured that.  I didn't know that.  Oh, look at this.  Here it is.  See, look at this.  He walks off the edge of the pool.  As if those are just hotel guests.  Whoa.  Look.  There's obviously a surface there, right beneath the water.  There's a surface.  See, and she's deep enough.  But wait, the bubbles didn't come up all the way. 
[02:46:30]  That's because there's a clear acrylic board.  Oh, is there?  Yeah.  See, I didn't know that.  That's not true.  You're just hating on him.  He's walking on water.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  I see it.  Like, Jesus.  Jesus.  Man.  It's so obvious.  Yeah, and you can see where his feet are stomping on the board.  Yeah.  And he's got to do it slow so it doesn't splash.  You can see that nobody's directly in front of him.  No.  Why aren't they right in front of him?  That's true.  Because I'd grab his leg and shake it. 
[02:47:00]  Would you?  Oh, and he did it to the side.  Yeah, he's trying to make it like his shoe fell off right under his foot, but he put his foot off to the side.  Oh, now there's a break in it right there.  Go back a little.  There's a break in the bridge.  Wait.  There's a small break in the bridge, and that girl swam right through it.  And he stepped over it.  Stepped over the break.  See, the thing is, wouldn't you be embarrassed if all these people see how you did your trick?  They're all in on it, yeah.  All of them, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  They're all in on it.  You ever see when he levitates and they show him levitating real high off the ground?  Yeah.  He's doing his little levitation thing where he just stands on one toe and blocks it with his other foot, and then the people are like, oh, cool.  But then what they show is later done in production where he's up with a cable, and he's levitated real high.  Yeah.  Like, it just stunts.  It works.  It's fake.  It's special effects.  I didn't think it was going to happen.  I just expected him to fall right in.  Did you? 
[02:48:00]  Why?  You saw the acrylic.  It's just like filming a movie except pretending it's real life.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they do this stuff in movies and just say, yeah, of course it's fake.  You know, the card tricks are very amazing.  I'll give him that.  I like the sleight of hand stuff.  Yeah, that shit.  But this fucking, this is nothing.  I got 44 million views, man.  It's so stupid.  I like Chris, though.  I mean, it's...  He's a good guy, but that trick is dumb.  Did you see when he levitated off of the top of the hotel, the pyramid hotel there?  Yes.  The Luxor? 
[02:48:30]  It was magic.  No, it was cables and a helicopter.  Yeah.  And then they show it on television like it's really happening.  Look who's back.  The Masked Magician.  Oh, the Masked Magician.  Oh, no.  Oh, is he doing the walk across water?  Let's hear.  Oh, no.  Let's hear.  People are going to think I figured out the secret from watching the Masked Magician.  I would look at him suspiciously dressed like that for the pool.  Water and innocent spectators.  Spectators, my ass.  Please zip through.  Spectators, my fucking shit.  You don't want to watch every painful minute of this? 
[02:49:00]  No, because Harvey will be here very shortly, and I want to get to this.  Harvey?  Harvey.  He is walking on water.  Oh, my God.  I just saw this.  I told you this was biblical.  It looks exactly like the Criss Angel one.  Yeah.  While surrounded by spectators, the magician is walking across...  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  Then what happens?  Jeez, do they milk this shit?  Yeah.  Come on.  44 million views, man.  She just called this show, Fuck You, Criss Angel. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, there's a ball going through it.  We just saw the Masked Magician attempt a feat that has been written about for more than 2,000 years.  It's all about 2,000.  Walking on water.  And he did it in a pool surrounded by spectators and his beautiful assistants.  Ooh.  Those whores.  So how did the magician create the illusion of walking on water?  They're doing it exactly like the Criss Angel one.  I can't believe I got it right.  But...  Yeah, but you didn't say it was industrial grade. 
[02:50:00]  You thought it was very thin.  Clear plexiglass legs.  When it is emerged in the water...  Disappears?  ...and photographed from the correct angles, the plexiglass is invisible and impossible to detect.  But as the camera angle changes, the plexiglass becomes visible.  Oh!  The next secret is that the assistants and innocent spectators in the plexiglass...  Is he?  ...have been paid to act like they can't see the plexiglass platforms.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to turn this off.  I guess we've got to turn this off.  All right.  The platforms in this illusion have been constructed in various size planks. 
[02:50:30]  And are supported by the clear legs that reach the bottom of the pool.  All right.  Turn it off.  Jesus.  You were terrified?  There he is.  Hi, Harvey.  How you doing, Harvey?  How are you?  Pleasure.  Pull up a mic.  Oh, we're on.  Yeah.  We just do it like this.  People walk in.  We talk.  We were just watching some crappy magician.  You know that magician that gives away all the magic tricks on TV?  Who's that?  You see that guy?  No.  The masked magician.  He debunks all the things that we believe were true magic. 
[02:51:00]  And it's heartbreaking.  Yes.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Well.  So you're here and you have a movie out.  The Untouchables.  Yeah.  Which I saw last night.  Yeah.  Which I didn't know was a foreign film until I, like, there was something about the opening  scene.  They're driving very quickly.  And I'm like, it just doesn't look like America.  And then they started talking in French.  And I'm like, good call.  Wow.  You are sharp.  Yeah.  I really am.  Five minutes into the subtitles, I'm like, wait, this is probably not going to change.  But how would you describe the movie?  I liked it a lot because I had no idea what it was about. 
[02:51:30]  I had no synopsis of it.  But no idea what to expect.  And I thought it was great.  It's a true story.  And it's the world's biggest comedy.  People all over the world are seeing this in record numbers.  You know, people, it is in French with subtitles.  We're thinking about doing a remake.  But it's a true story of this race car driver, this billionaire, you know, who loses his wife.  He crashes his car at 180 miles an hour.  And he becomes, you know, he has no feeling from the waist down. 
[02:52:00]  And he doesn't want to hire anybody, you know, to take care of him who pities him.  So he finds this street kid, you know.  And together, their relationship is anything but caretaker and patient.  They go out and find girls.  They jump out of airplanes.  They drive race cars.  They get in trouble with the police.  It's, you know, I mean, it's just a wonderful, fabulous, true story.  And you watch this movie and you feel great.  I wouldn't promote this movie unless I 100% really felt the audience would just love the film and feel great seeing it. 
[02:52:30]  It's the second biggest movie in French history.  Like, it's made, it's probably going to do a half a billion by the time it's finished.  It's done like 340 million worldwide.  And, yeah, like this guy, he plays a quadriplegic.  And there's a scene where the guy comes in and he's looking just to get on, I guess, to get what the equivalent of unemployment is in France.  And he's just, the guy's just kind of being a dick.  He's just going, could you sign this?  I just want my benefits.  And for some reason, the fact that he's kind of talking abusively or like an asshole to the guy in the chair, he likes that. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, really?  He's like, he's the only one who's not showing me compassion or pity.  He's the only one who's talking to me like a real person.  And they had this really weird bond and he hired him.  And it was great, man.  I was, I was, I cried a little bit.  Yeah, I really hate that too.  Because I'm like, I know they want me to cry.  And I dropped a tear.  I was like, oh, you asshole.  You did, did, yeah.  I fell for it.  Jimmy's a sensitive guy.  It's really, it's romantic and it's funny.  And it's a true story.  And I'll tell you, you know, the scene where we throw the guys out of the airplane.  This, in the real movie, you see the footage at the end of the movie. 
[02:53:30]  These two guys were crazy.  They jumped out of an airplane, you know, the real guys that it's based on.  And we have that footage.  We use the little homemade footage at the end of the movie.  So our two actors, you know, we waited and waited, waited.  We shot the entire movie last day.  We said, come on, we'll take you up on the airplane.  They figured it's going to be the typical Hollywood.  There's going to be 75 stuntmen.  You know, we're just going to shoot their closeup.  We said, no, we're going to throw you out of the plane.  And they go, what happens if we die?  We said, we've got enough footage to cut the movie together.  And we're going to dedicate the film to you guys. 
[02:54:00]  And we threw them out of the goddamn airplane.  That is not CGI.  That is those two guys scared shitless, if I can say.  Wow.  Out of the plane.  There's nothing.  There's no, it's just the cameras on them.  There's no cutting.  Nothing.  You're watching two frightened human beings.  Wow.  Out of an airplane.  Now, who would you use in the remake?  Or do you not know yet?  Well, I signed Colin Firth to play the billionaire.  Wow.  I mean, so he's done.  And I got Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids.  So, you know, you know, there's a twist with the girl in the movie. 
[02:54:30]  There's a very sexy girl.  And then there's a twist on her.  So there's a lot of girls who want to play that part, you know.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  The redhead.  Right.  The redhead.  Yeah.  She's hot.  She is hot.  And then, you know, I think it's anybody from Jamie Foxx, Chris Tucker, Chris Rocks.  Sway told me he wants to do it.  Oh, yeah.  I bet.  I'll do it.  I'm not black, but I mean, I can really, I can play up any accent you need.  It looks like a good...  You mean you're willing to leave this show and come to Hollywood? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, right.  And make out with, like, beautiful women if I cast them?  I'll make out with Jamie Foxx or Will Smith if you wanted me to.  I'm desperate, Harvey.  But, yeah, it's amazing.  When you hear about a remake, it's like you immediately start thinking, who are they going  to use it?  And, of course, Will Smith is the go-to guy, but I think he's probably too old.  And, you know, maybe not too old, but, you know, this seemed like a younger dude, like  a 25-year-old guy.  Cock-blocking.  Yeah, you're right.  Jesus.  He's like, I was thinking of, but, you know, Jimmy said he is, and I think he might be right.  I'm always saying this seemed like a young, street-wise guy who's, like, 25 years old. 
[02:55:30]  You do need a young guy.  Oh, man.  You know, but Chris Tucker, Chris Rock could do it, too.  And Chris Tucker's doing stand-up again.  I've been seeing him at the Comedy Cellar.  It's like, you haven't seen him for a while, and he's, like, starting to get back into stand-up,  too.  So, yeah.  I just did a movie with Chris Tucker, and he is fabulous.  It's funny, and also, you know, it's a movie with Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and  Bob De Niro.  It's called Silver Linings Handbook.  He is great in the movie, and I had a really, really good time working with Chris.  And he is doing stand-up.  Is he?  Yeah.  You know, Quentin Tarantino and I were going to, once wanted to film him, you know, whatever. 
[02:56:00]  I tell Chris, I told Chris this story, and I'll tell you guys.  This is the first time I ever said it publicly.  So, Quentin and I say, okay, Chris, why don't, I'll produce it, Quentin will direct it.  And Chris said, great.  I said, well, just do 50-50.  You know, Quentin and I, I'll split 50, you take 50, it's your stand-up.  He comes back to it, goes 90-10.  Him.  Whoa.  I said, I haven't worked for five since I was in junior high school.  And Quentin Tarantino, you're giving five.  So, I've never, ever let Chris Tucker, if you're listening, forget this.  Wait, did he blow a chance to have you and Quentin do his... 
[02:56:30]  Stand-up.  Oh, my God.  How do you say...  Why do you do that?  Why do you do...  You sure he meant 90 his way?  I'm so sure.  I'm sure it's going to go 90-10 my way now.  Yes.  Wow.  He hears this radio broadcast, he'll be signing on the dotted line.  Wow.  I mean, you always try to get a little...  A little more, right?  On stand-up, they always get you on distribution fees.  That's how a lot of the companies do it, right?  He knows every...  Oh, yeah.  Can you come to work for me after this show?  Well, no, I'm in stand-up.  Believe me, I've been fucked pretty good. 
[02:57:00]  But, you know, you get these guys like Tommy Mottoli used to be a musician.  He run the record company.  You know, Jimmy Iovine, whatever.  You could come and work for me.  Well, what they do...  Can we find somebody...  Was there somebody you have in mind, or do you want to just go solo?  I'd be like the hacker who goes after other hackers.  Do you think they'll pay you his salary, too?  You could just leave me in the dust as you go to Hollywood, Jimmy.  My salary is shite.  Believe me, I'm easy to pull away from you.  No, what they do is, like, when they say, like, we'll split the DVDs with you.  We'll split it 60-40, you know.  But on top of that, there's a distribution fee, which kind of like a VIG comes off the top. 
[02:57:30]  Wow.  Which, again, is very standard.  I mean, everybody does it, so...  Business man.  Yeah, we just watch a bachelor.  You ought to give your card to the entertainers when they're on this show.  Yeah.  You know everything about...  Or just open up a law firm.  No, but you know what?  I would just kind of go in and say that, and they would just find a way to talk around  me, because, you know, we still got fucked on.  They're like, yeah, but we don't change it.  We knew about it.  They said I'm the first comic to ever ask about it, and they're like, yeah, but we got  to do it.  We don't change it.  Yeah, but we're going to still fuck you.  Yeah.  It's almost like when you're going to get electrocuted, you're like, you're going to pull 
[02:58:00]  that switch, and I'm going to die.  And they go, yeah, that's what's going to happen.  And there's really not a whole lot you can say about it.  Oh, my God.  I think people are very, I guess, not very knowledgeable about what you do.  What is it that you do in the movie industry?  Well, I do a number of things.  I guess the thing that I do most well-known for is I'll find the book.  Like this book, we're talking about Silver Linings.  A woman who worked for me said, read this book.  Five years ago, six years ago, I read the book. 
[02:58:30]  Loved it.  We bought it.  We hired David O. Russell, who we also co-produced The Fighter with, to write the script, direct  the movie.  We went after people.  I was involved in the casting with Bradley and Jennifer.  And, of course, Bob De Niro, you don't have to be involved in it.  You just pray and hope you get him.  Yeah.  And Chris Tucker.  And we put the project together.  And we hire all the people.  We get the financing.  We produce the movie.  And it's an art, you mean, producing the movie.  But it's just because it's tied into money and financing. 
[02:59:00]  It does seem very business.  When you see 27 names sometimes, you know, I go, wow, produced by 27 people, you don't  realize who actually does the work.  The 26 other people are the guys who wrote the check.  Oh, okay.  Well, there should be a distinction between the person that actually has to know the  talent, know who's going to work in this movie well, and the guy that's just writing  the check.  They're starting to do that now.  Are they?  They're doing a little mark thing.  I mean, that does distinguish it.  And then very often, like in the case of this, we read the script of The Untouchables. 
[02:59:30]  They were making it in France at the time, and we came in.  We loved the script.  We saw some footage, and we bought the movie for a bunch of territories.  So in that case, we're acquiring movies and distributing movies.  Have there been anything you...  Because you're known as a very ballsy guy.  Like, you'll just go out and grab something, and you make a lot of amazing, smart moves.  Has there been anything that you like?  Like, Chris Tucker will look back on that and go, God, that was really a bad move on my  part.  Like, is there anything...  Especially when he hears it today.  It was a really...  It was not a bright move, and I don't really know him well, but that's the first thing I'm  going to say if I ever see him again. 
[03:00:00]  Hi, Chris.  What the fuck were you thinking?  Is there anything that you've passed on that you look back on and go, man, we probably  should have taken that one?  And I missed the first five minutes of La Femme Nikita at a screening, the French movie  the Luc Besson did.  Right.  And I'm five minutes late for a screening.  It taught me a lesson for life.  Always get there five, ten minutes early.  So I missed the first five minutes, and the movie made no sense to me.  So they gave it to me on a silver platter, and I said, I don't get it.  And then I realized the first five minutes, as you see what she's screwed up, she's out  of her mind. 
[03:00:30]  She goes in and robs this store because she's a street person dying for dope.  And then they train her to become an assassin.  So I missed the setup.  And then I made no sense.  I'm just watching this girl, and she's training, and I'm going, what's the big deal with this  movie?  Right.  It's like missing the first five or ten minutes of a Columbo episode.  Exactly.  That's when the crime is done.  And if you miss that, you might as well not watch it.  Exactly.  Because then he's trying to solve stuff, and you're like, I don't even know what happened.  Although the giveaway is whoever Columbo talks to in every other scene, that would  be the guy that did it.  I missed the first five minutes, but he's talking to Johnny Cash for some reason. 
[03:01:00]  There's no reason.  But he shot his wife.  Believe me, Martin Landau isn't here as an extra.  So it's the biggest star is the murderer.  That he's talking to, yeah.  I never figured that out.  God, I got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have called you on that one.  Yeah, I'm a Columbo expert.  It's kind of my thing.  This comedy is not really panning out, so I do Columbo panels, and people ask questions.  Columbo panels.  What was, you obviously, you were with Miramax, and you left and started the Weinstein Company  with your brother.  What was it that finally made you go like, eh, I want to go out and do something on my own? 
[03:01:30]  Was there something that was happening that you just weren't happy with?  Well, Miramax started, Bob and I started Miramax.  Miramax is named after my mom, Miriam, who's 86 years old.  And if she's listening to this show, I'm going to have a long time on her.  Yeah, we'd be very shocked.  Yeah, I mean, me too.  And my dad, you know, we lost him early, but he was a great inspiration to us.  We started the company, and then we were sold to Disney, then we made a partnership with  Disney, and we just had, you know, some fights with corporate management. 
[03:02:00]  I'll tell you the truth, guys.  We made Fahrenheit 9-11 with Michael Moore, and they hated it.  I mean, they thought it was like, oh, my God, they're going to dethrone President Bush,  and we're going to get into all sorts of trouble as a company, the Walt Disney Company,  and it just exacerbated it.  And I also brought them Lord of the Rings, which is a project that I developed, all three  scripts, and they wouldn't finance them.  I mean, I got pissed off.  It only cost them and me $2.3 billion.  That's it.  Today, I could have owned Sirius.  Believe me, we wish you did. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, we wish.  No, Mel, they're kidding.  John Malone, they're kidding.  Greg Maffay, they're really kidding.  Wow, he knows all of them.  Oh, yeah.  They're men I've never met before.  Scott, Scott, Scott, Greenstein, they're kidding.  Scott, I know Mel.  They are kidding.  So, wait, you brought Lord of the Rings.  Now, you don't have Lord of the Rings.  Who actually did Lord of the Rings?  Lord of the Rings ended up being produced by New Line.  They had the guts, the balls, as you can say on this show, to take that project.  We have a percentage of the gross, so we did extremely well. 
[03:03:00]  Wow.  You know what I mean?  But it was personal.  Disney was so unhappy with the idea of it that they gave Bob and I a personal share.  And how do you pass on Lord of the Rings?  And not only that, we showed him 10 minutes of the technology.  The guy who was running it at the time was a guy named Michael Eisner.  We showed him 10 minutes of what it looked like with 10,000 extras in all those scenes.  Peter Jackson developed all that.  We financed.  We put $10 million into financing.  So, between Fahrenheit 9-11 and Lord of the Rings, and then we were going to try to do this channel, like a Miramax channel. 
[03:03:30]  Scott Greenstein knows a lot about this because he used to work with us.  And so, I think these three things exacerbated and we just said it's time to go.  And I think they thought it was time for us to go, too.  You guys were synonymous with Miramax.  They weren't sad.  You know what I mean?  When we walked out the door, there wasn't like tears.  Did they at least pretend to try to keep you?  Or they were like, the minute you said you wanted to do it?  No, no, no.  They made us a very serious offer to stay.  They did make us a very serious offer to stay.  But it didn't have the same freedoms that we had enjoyed previously. 
[03:04:00]  Anyhow, it all turned out for the best.  But you like the idea that you can just go out and kind of grab whatever you want to grab.  Like, this is a movie that maybe because it's made $340 million, people would go, all right, let's do something with it.  But before that, a lot of people might not see this concept and go, yeah, that would be a great comedy.  Hey, I bought it.  It hadn't been released.  I read it on a script.  I saw footage.  The movie had never been in a theater.  I mean, so, I mean, it's just the same thing like with The Artist last year.  You know, I sat and watched a black and white movie. 
[03:04:30]  You know, people in my own company thought I was a lunatic, you know, to do that.  Like, you know, they said, oh, we produced The King's Speech, so we'd won the Oscar the year before.  And they thought with The Artist, it was like hubris.  Oh, my God.  Now they think they just did a movie with stuttering that grossed $400 million.  Now they're going to do a black and white silent movie.  You know what I mean?  And nobody, stuttering is like a, was the action scene compared to having nothing in The Artist.  And people told us they're crazy.  So right now the movie's up to $160 million worldwide. 
[03:05:00]  For a black and white artist.  And won the Oscar and four other Oscars.  One of my favorite things about The Artist was the fact that Malcolm McDowell did a cameo.  They got Malcolm McDowell just to do a weird little cameo sitting there, like kind of like he was waiting to do something.  And he talked to, I forget what her name, oh, Pepe.  Berenice Bajot.  Oh, Pepe.  What was it, Pepe in the film?  And that was all Malcolm McDowell was in.  Yeah.  I'm like, what a great thing to get Malcolm McDowell.  But you know, when you work with the director, the guy's name is Michel Hazanvizias.  And I'd seen his two other movies.  He is a genius.  You know, he's like a Billy Wilder. 
[03:05:30]  He's a throwback to the great directors like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder.  I mean, once upon a time, you used to watch these comedies.  And they made sense from beginning, middle, and end.  And they were smart and emotional.  That's what The Untouchables is a throwback to, too.  You know, I mean, just, you know, it's really smart storytelling.  And that's why it's grossed so much money.  Even, you know, you see these big special effects movies.  It's five minutes in, you're going, Jesus Christ, I've seen that before.  Ten minutes in, you're saying, I'm so bored. 
[03:06:00]  Twenty minutes in, you say, can anybody act in this movie?  Half an hour in, you go, who the hell financed this movie?  You know what I mean?  And you're just going, oh my God, I'm sick of these effects.  I'm sick of everything.  Can I go now?  And The Untouchables is that human storytelling.  And, you know, Hollywood doesn't understand it.  You make a movie about two people who are friends, go through trials and tribulations,  and you're laughing your ass off, and you're enjoying it, and you walk out of the theater,  and, you know, you can dance.  You can smile.  It's very rare that you'll get a movie where there is good storytelling, good acting. 
[03:06:30]  It's so hard to find these days.  And I'm not sure how, how does that play in America?  I really kind of, I'm so jaded now with the American public and what they find entertaining these days.  Well, listen, if you give it to them, they'll come.  You know, this Marigold's movie is not my movie, you know, with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.  It's terrific.  What was it?  It's such fun.  It's the Marigold Hotel.  It's a really charming movie, but it makes sense at the beginning, middle, and end. 
[03:07:00]  John Madden, we did a movie with him called Shakespeare in Love.  He's a wonderful director, and the movie's a wonderful movie.  I think, you know, we market and bombard these big movies because we're looking for a common denominator.  And I think, you know, when you, you know, these small movies can work, and these small movies can become big movies.  Look at the King's Speech.  $400 million.  It cost $15 million to make the movie.  Worldwide gross.  Look at this, I mean, The Untouchables.  $15 million movie. 
[03:07:30]  $350 million so far.  It's what he said.  It's going to gross $500 million, this movie.  And it's doing great in America.  What I liked about it, too, was the, it wasn't schmaltzy interaction.  Like, that's what was surprising to me was, like, usually there's, he really was fucking with the guy who was quadriplegic.  And it was an interaction, like, that's how somebody who really likes you treats you.  And it was an oddly non-schmaltzy interaction, which I liked.  The second I saw what it was, I'm like, okay, I kind of know where this is going to go.  But I didn't. 
[03:08:00]  It was, it was much harsher dialogue and much harsher interaction that I was like, fuck, I'm so happy he said that.  There was really, really some great moments in it.  Yeah, the guy's feeding the guy.  And, you know, the girl walks in the room.  She's got a great butt.  You know, whatever.  He pushes, he pushes the guy aside, gets food all over the guy, doesn't give a shit, whatever.  He just loves that butt and loves that girl.  And that's what happened.  These two guys are like that.  I met the one, you mean, and they are like that.  You know, they are 100%.  That was their relationship. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, and they show them at the end in photos and in video, which is kind of cool.  I always like that when it's based on a true story to see the real people at the end.  There's just something about that.  Like, okay, they really are.  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like it would be such a difficult thing to read through something, like you  did a script or a book or something, and not just go like, eh, or read everything and  go, oh, God, that could be a movie.  That could be a movie.  How do you pick and choose?  I think instinctively you know.  You just know at this point.  You know what's good at this point, you know. 
[03:09:00]  And, you know, it's just, it's almost like reading a book.  You say, is that a good book or a bad book?  How many books have we all read?  You have to look at it in a different way, though.  So, can you make, can it work in a visual medium like that, which has to just boggle  the mind, though, sometimes.  Do you still, and obviously you have a lot of experience, do you still kind of mull it  over and go like, yeah, it's good, but.  Listen, you know, half the time, if I went through my movie list, you talk about my, I  did a movie, My Left Foot.  Does that make any sense?  You know, I mean, you know, it's a guy who only has a left foot. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Then you add Daniel Day-Lewis to the equation, and you've got something magical.  Yeah.  Look, I don't believe in boundaries or barriers, so I just let, let imagine it.  And, you know, for me, it's just, if we like it, we think other people will like it, too.  And we're not like, oh my God, we like it.  Like, we're snobs or anything like that.  We want people to go to the movies.  I love movies.  I love James Bond movie.  I love good, fun movie.  But I like them when they're done well.  Like, the Bond movies now are done well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he's amazing, and Judi Dench is amazing.  Yeah, Daniel Craig is a really good Bond. 
[03:10:00]  Great Bond, yeah.  He's great.  But the artist, like, when you think of something like the artist, how do you look at that in  a script and know that, because this is one of the best scenes, and it's an odd scene.  It's a, I guess, I don't know what the name of the shot is, but it's a faraway shot of  them walking up and down stairs and kind of hustling and bustling and going about their day.  And it's kind of a faraway shot of steps, and it was all done in one shot.  And I'm like, what a visual masterpiece this is.  How do you read that in a script and go, okay, here, people walk up and down the steps 30 seconds. 
[03:10:30]  How does that read in a script?  Michelle, when you read Michelle's script of the artist, it's so beautifully described.  And, you know, Michelle gave me a movie.  It's called City Girl.  It's by this guy, Murnau, the director.  And that scene was a tribute, you know, to the silent movies.  You watch some of these silent movies because they couldn't talk.  There's, the visuals are so strong, so amazing.  Anybody who doesn't, you know, it just, on an accessible level, go watch Charlie Chaplin's  City Lights.  Here, I'll put it to your audience in a way that they'll understand it.  I guarantee that if a guy takes a girl and you get that DVD of Charlie Chaplin's City 
[03:11:00]  Lights, you're going to score at the end of the night.  100%.  This movie is a, there's 100% guarantee.  I've tried the same thing, but with the kid.  It didn't work.  Wrong movie.  At the Comedy Cellar, they show Chaplin's movie.  That works for Sandusky.  That doesn't work for you.  Exactly.  A little horse play.  There was a, uh...  Horse play.  Naughty, naughty, Jerry.  Oh, boy.  There's at the Comedy Cellar upstairs at the Olive Tree Restaurant above the comedy club. 
[03:11:30]  They have, they show Chaplin films on a loop.  And it's amazing that people, uh, while you're eating, you always see people looking up and  getting glued into these movies.  Yeah, but they watch two seconds of it.  Watch City Lights from beginning to end.  You know, whatever.  It is so funny, so romantic, and it comes with a guarantee.  Well, you realize how much to...  That's a bold statement.  You realize how much is wasted.  And if the girl isn't interested at the end of it, she's not worth it.  Get rid of her.  She's not worth it.  Get rid of her.  If she doesn't like that movie, Quentin Tarantino always said to me, the first thing 
[03:12:00]  he does is he shows the girl Rio Bravo, the John Wayne movie, and he says, if they can't  watch Rio Bravo, it's over.  He said, there's no point...  Wow, that's really...  Pitch and pulling?  Look at Rio Bravo.  You think it's just the John Wayne Western?  Angie Dickinson is so sexy in that movie.  That's a Howard Hawks movie.  The guy who did His Girl Friday.  The dialogue.  You watch the dialogue again in that movie.  Everything she says is the hottest come-ons ever in that movie.  That's why Rio Bravo's been enduring. 
[03:12:30]  That's the beauty of Tarantino.  Not because of the gunfight.  Yeah.  If you're Tarantino, you can do that.  You can go, all right, look, I'll bang you, but you have to like this movie.  I take what I can get.  I watch what she wants to watch.  That's the mistake.  The mistake.  Bridges of Madison County.  Whatever she wants to watch.  I want Golden Pond.  Look, I have a hard-on.  Now I know why Nicholas Sparks has a career.  Yeah, but I...  Oh, God.  Didn't Howard Hughes used to do that, too?  Wouldn't he kind of like get girls and have them watch certain movies and just kind of 
[03:13:00]  make them...  Well, mostly he would make them watch...  Seriously, I made The Aviator with Marty Scorsese.  So he did a lot of research on Howard Hughes.  What Howard Hughes would do is he'd make them watch that movie.  That movie was called Hell's Angels.  Oh, right, right.  Where he made his incredible epic of airplanes because he was a great aviator.  So over and over and over again, he'd take these girls and they'd have to watch that movie.  That's odd.  And wouldn't he buy up their contracts?  Like he was...  I guess because he kind of...  He was OCD and he hoarded stuff.  So I heard he would buy up their contracts and just kind of keep them on hold. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, 26 girls under contract on any given day.  And he used to put them all over Beverly Hills.  And what he would do is he'd hire drivers who were Mormons, you know, probably Mitt Romney's  grandfather, you know, and...  Just a joke.  And they would drive these girls because they were, quote, you know, religious and they wouldn't  interfere.  But, of course, some of the guys did and they would be, you know, and sometimes these  girls would wait six months to see how it used. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  Just sitting there in Beverly Hills somewhere waiting.  Sitting there in Beverly Hills waiting.  Under contract.  Yep.  When you got into the business, you probably didn't get into it and say, okay, I'm going  to run a studio someday.  When you first got in, what did you go like, this is what I want to do?  And it kind of became this.  Well, I love movies.  I mean, I love movies when I was a kid, you know, and I love baseball when I was a kid.  I realized very quickly, you know, that that baseball career wasn't happening.  And, you know, so I love film.  I studied film.  You know, I went to film school.  I studied with this great Dr. O'Grady. 
[03:14:30]  And, you know, I just love movies.  So, no, we never think envision that it's going to be a studio.  You just say, I want to make movies or I want to do something in the movie industry.  And I loved to read when I was a kid.  My eye poked out when I was 11.  I was playing some stupid cowboy and Indian game.  And coincidentally and good for me was there was a woman next door who was a librarian.  She was 72 years old, retired.  So, I knocked on her door.  I said, I'm bored to death.  I can't go to school.  What do you recommend?  And she put me on a reading course.  And, you know, she started with these American books and then graduated to international books. 
[03:15:00]  And, you know, reading is the key.  Reading really is the key.  You make a movie every day, guys.  You just go read some of these great books.  You read Gone with the Wind.  You read War and Peace.  Those are great, great books.  Yeah.  What do you think makes a lousy movie?  Because, you know, you see a lot of lousy movies.  And what, without even going into what movies they are, what will you look at in a movie and go like, ugh, this is going to be awful.  The script.  I mean, when you hear those incredible lines of dialogue, you know, I don't care if you're Russell Crowe or Lawrence Olivier or, you know, Charlie Chaplin. 
[03:15:30]  You cannot put crappy lines over.  You just can't do it.  How does that stuff get through?  Because, like, guys see that and, like, the actors do it.  Like, how does somebody not go, like, dash, cheesy.  That's terrible.  People are blind.  You know, whenever they read this crap, they think it's, they think, you know, as my father would say, they think their S doesn't shine.  You know what I mean?  Or they think their S shines, you know.  And, you know, it's just, they just believe it. 
[03:16:00]  And, you know, you know this industry.  You probably have this all day long, six, seven people telling you how great you are every day.  No.  No.  Come on.  You must have a posse.  Cumulatively, if you want to go, like, in a calendar year, I'll get six or seven, but no a day.  No.  You're giving me a lot of credit.  I appreciate it.  What did you think, because Quentin Tarantino is great at writing dialogue.  It's just amazing to watch his movies and watch people just exchange words.  It doesn't have to be an action sequence or anything. 
[03:16:30]  Just people talking is compelling.  What did you think when you first met him?  Did he come off as a weird guy?  Not at all.  I mean, he came off as a, you know, guy who knew movies, knew cinema better than anybody.  And his knowledge is so vast and deep.  You know, he named his company Band Apart, which is named after a Jean-Luc Godard movie.  This guy knows everything about films.  He's an encyclopedia.  For a guy like me who went to film school, he was film school.  He's really intelligent and a really humanistic guy.  But his dialogue is a special effect. 
[03:17:00]  There's nobody who can write like Quentin in the movie industry.  This guy can have five pages of two people talking to each other, eating a pie.  And you're laughing and you're scared shit at the same time.  And I just came back from New Orleans where we're shooting Django.  You know, the new movie with Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington and Sam Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio.  It just, people think Inglorious Bastards kicked ass.  Wait.  Yeah, I saw the trailer for it.  It's like, it's a throwback to it. 
[03:17:30]  Because he does a great job with taking some stuff from the past and bringing it up like he did with, oh, what the hell was that?  The Grindhouse stuff.  Right.  That he did.  And this is, it's like a throwback to the blaxploitation movies.  And the spaghetti westerns.  Of the 70s and spaghetti westerns.  Yeah.  It looks pretty damn good.  And I like Leo.  Leo is about the most evil thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  You know, he is evil personified.  He's a brilliant, brilliant performer. 
[03:18:00]  Well, he's not, it seems like Tarantino's not afraid to take like a banal subject and make a real conversation about it.  Whether it's gourmet coffee in Pulp Fiction or tipping.  And for some reason, the natural flow of the conversation makes it fascinating.  And that's what's great is these guys are talking about tipping.  Who gives a shit in Reservoir Dogs?  But it's an amazing scene.  Hearing guys speak naturally about something.  To open a movie with just dialogue is amazing.  Like, who the hell would think doing that without...  But who the hell can write dialogue?  Right.  You would think you want an action sequence to capture people? 
[03:18:30]  But his dialogue is an action sequence.  You're laughing and suspenseful at the same time.  Who leaves the tip?  I mean, he writes like that.  You're throwing a buck.  Throwing a buck.  You know, Quentin's an actor, too.  You know what I mean?  So he's a brilliant director, but he has an actor's ear for dialogue.  You know, so you can really, and he can also tell when it's performed right.  You know, it just takes brilliant people to also do that kind of dialogue.  Yeah.  I mean, I was amazed watching DiCaprio.  Because, you know, you wonder every time...  He's new to the Tarantino family. 
[03:19:00]  Sam Jackson, he does it in his sleep.  You know, Brad Pitt got it like day two.  You know, just did it great.  Got the single patient.  I swear, I watched DiCaprio, and Quentin and I both were like blown away.  I mean, the rhythm.  He got right into the rhythm of it.  You can give that kid a speech.  He can talk for a day.  You know what I mean?  You know, and just watch him talk whenever you go.  And don't worry.  We kill plenty of people in this movie.  Sex up the wazoo.  You know, we didn't forget where we came from. 
[03:19:30]  I mean, in Glorious Bastards, is it Christoph Waltz?  Yeah, Christoph.  Oh, my God.  He's in Django, too.  Yeah, he's in Django, yeah.  To play a funny Nazi, there was a charm to him, an odd charm in him being a psychopath.  Was that written to be humorous, or did he just grab that and kind of make it that?  No, no, no.  He said every word, and he said it exactly the way Quentin intended it.  Quentin sees all shades of people, whatever.  So he really, I mean, he's the greatest opportunist of all time, Christoph Waltz. 
[03:20:00]  I think, you know, I think beyond being a Nazi, he's just in it for himself.  That was another sequence that started a movie off, and it was so suspenseful and compelling.  You were just hooked.  You could not, I couldn't imagine going like, meh, meh, take it or leave it.  You were just edge of your seat taken.  And there wasn't action going on.  It was a dialogue between that father and him at that table, and the little, those little things like the milk, getting the milk for him. 
[03:20:30]  Just frightening.  And then later on, Christoph Waltz has a scene with the girl when she's all grown up.  Yeah.  And he's eating a pie, and he turns to the waiter and says, can I have some milk?  Yeah.  And the milk comes to the table, and then you're reminded of the milk at the beginning of the scene.  I mean, you know, who does that in a movie?  Fantastic.  He's not afraid to let things just kind of sink in.  He's not afraid to let things breathe a little bit.  I hate to say that, but it's what makes his movies great.  He's synonymous with Miramax.  Like, that was a whole, in the 90s, yeah, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  He's a very loyal guy.  Yep.  Apparently so.  He really is incredible.  We've done every movie together.  Good guy to have.  Since the beginning of it.  Good guy to have in the stable.  For me, he's like Babe Ruth.  He's the house that Quentin built.  Yeah.  The house that Quentin built.  I was in one, I believe you guys did Comedian, Seinfeld's movie.  Yes.  And I had one line.  This is why I love the wine scene.  This is why.  Because I had one line in that movie.  I was on stage when Sherrod was going to bring on Jerry, and I got a full day's pay for it.  And they didn't have to give me anything.  They just kind of panned by me for a half a second.  Really? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  But a lot of people said I was kind of the pivotal point of the film, which I appreciate.  I said it.  And Seinfeld, in his true moments, said it too.  You know, and he wasn't thinking it was him.  He thought it was you.  Can I tell you something?  That to me always, that bothers me, that movie, because that is a really underrated movie.  I mean, the critics liked it, but the audiences, I don't think, understood what Jerry was just  trying to, you know, to take the process of movie making.  Not movie making.  Stand up, yeah.  Being a comedian.  Of stand up.  And just showing it.  And you watch it.  It's as good as any documentary. 
[03:22:00]  I've done the Michael Morris.  I've done Errol Morris.  I've done some of the, you know, so-called really important groundbreaking documentaries.  But there was something about that on a, just on a me personal level.  I know Bob felt the same way.  That was just breathtaking to get into that world.  He really got you into that world.  Do you think the timing wise coming off of a huge show like Seinfeld, people kind of wanted  to see Seinfeld?  I think that was it.  I mean, at the end of the day, you said Seinfeld as a director. 
[03:22:30]  I mean, you know, and then you just, yeah, they were expecting, yeah.  It was fantastic, though, because there were so many uncomfortable moments in that, too,  where you're kind of like, this is the guy from that huge hit show, and it's like he's  starting all over again.  Had Marty Scorsese made Comedian, I think the audience would have gone.  And you know what?  I'm not saying it because I think Jerry did an amazing job.  Sure.  If you would have, I think your theory is right.  Substitute Scorsese's name for Seinfeld, and then they look at the movie a different way  than everybody wants to see it.  Yeah.  It was interesting at Governors, too.  Like, this is just so typical in New York. 
[03:23:00]  He's at Governors, and they're talking.  And it's like, this is Seinfeld on stage, and he has to scold the audience for talking.  I like that he showed that, and that's, you know, kind of what comics have to deal with.  Yeah.  I just don't get on a private plane after I'm done.  That's where we kind of part company.  Oh, that's where you're part company?  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe many other ways.  Well, Harvey's promoting, and it's very rare that you go out and actually do all this promotion  yourself, so it's great to have you in.  Thank you very much, guys, for having me.  And a true contributor you are to films. 
[03:23:30]  It's The Untouchables.  It's out now in limited release.  I don't know where people can find out where it's playing.  It's New York.  It's playing, you know, New York.  Chicago.  Paris.  New York, Chicago.  It's playing about 50 cities in the country, and it's going to expand even further in July.  Is it in Canada?  We're heard in Canada as well.  Is it in Canada?  It's playing in Canada as well, too.  It's doing great up there.  It's a great movie.  It is not, again, it's not a schmaltzy interaction, and it's based on a true story of a quadriplegic  who is taken care of by this inner city guy who is not a guy who would be likely to take 
[03:24:00]  care of him, which is kind of why they made the movie, because he would give a shit if  it was just a guy they hired who was nice to him.  My brother always says, when you hear, like, it's about a quadriplegic, my brother says,  I'm definitely not going.  I'm telling you, here, let me do that part.  Did I not sell it right?  Let me do that part.  This movie is probably, you know, and I think if you watch it in a theater, it's probably  the most uplifting movie.  You walk in, forget quadriplegic, any of that stuff.  It's just the relationship between two guys from opposite sides of the track, and it's 
[03:24:30]  so much fun, and it's really an amazing, I mean, you just, like you said, if it can make  him cry, just imagine what it does to the rest of the country.  Yes, so my comparison was not going to be good.  I was going to say, it's like Lethal Weapon meets Whose Life Is It Anyway?  Much better.  Much better.  Much better.  I love that it's like meets, yeah.  Oh, boy.  But it really is great, and it's easy to promote a movie that I genuinely liked.  And Harvey's track record is pretty good.  Tremendous.  I'll stake my reputation on this movie. 
[03:25:00]  And you need to do another documentary about comedians, I'm just saying.  Oh.  I'm not pitching myself, maybe a comedian who's kind of out of shape, who likes transgendered  friends.  Whatever.  I'd be happy to audition for that.  But I guess we're done for the day.  Yeah.  Let's take off the show.  Let me promote one thing.  This Friday, I'm at the Melrose Improv doing one show at 8 o'clock.  So if you're out in LA, come see me there.  Go see Jimmy.  And The Untouchables is out now.  Great.  Harvey Weinstein.  Thank you so much, man.  What a pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks.  We're done.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over. 
[03:25:30]  But if you feel like sticking around, After O&A Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I feel like you just heard me, right?  Because you did.  But now you do for real.  Now I'm telling you how I really feel on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Where's Opie?  Opie, has anybody gotten any updates from Opie? 
[03:26:00]  I texted him once on Monday.  And he never texted me back.  I'm afraid he's dying.  All I know is what I've heard from Jimmy.  Yeah.  And apparently he's shitting in his bed still.  I heard he had to shave his balls because he got all sorts of poo matted in the ball hair.  Oh, that's awful.  Yeah, he had to go clean.  He must be so stinky.  Well, not anymore.  Because he got it all out.  It's like when you get gum in your hair, you got to cut it out.  You got to cut it out.  Eric, have you heard anything from Opie?  No, nothing.  Just the shitting stuff that Jim has told us. 
[03:26:30]  That's all violently.  That's right.  He said he was shitting all over his balls at the doctor's office.  That's horrible.  I mean, I'm assuming that he'll be back tomorrow.  Eric, remember when you shit all over your balls?  Eric, did you shit on your balls?  Not that I recall.  In the hotel?  I remember some story.  Oh, at my wedding.  You shit on your balls.  No, I didn't shit on my balls.  You probably got some shit on your balls.  Nah, it went projectiling out.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, I should...  You didn't dip your balls in it by mistake when you sat down in the toilet? 
[03:27:00]  We should share.  I mean, there's been a lot of pantshitting stories.  Oh, boy.  I mean, if you want, I could always give you one.  You're just volunteering?  Well, I mean, since it came up.  Well, you know what?  Danny Ross, we can never say that you don't contribute.  Tell us here at After Opie and Anthony Live about your, uh...  I don't think I've ever told this story on the air.  Whoa, there's Sway.  I saw him on TV last night interviewing Justin Bieber.  Holy moly.  Go ahead.  Did you see how hot it's going to be today?  Holy moly.  Go ahead and talk to me about, uh... 
[03:27:30]  Well, you guys remember when we did the show, uh, when we were on XM, but also Terrestrial Radio,  and we had to actually use two different studios because the companies just wouldn't let us use one.  Right, we had to walk from K-Rock to XM every morning.  So there was two completely different studios, and the studio that we had over at CBS,  that's where we had to be in the morning.  So when we showed up for work, we actually, even though we all worked for XM,  we all had to go to CBS to start work.  Right.  And we were in Stern's old studio, and for those of you unfamiliar with it, 
[03:28:00]  there is a separate bathroom built in to the main studio.  Now, this was the studio where I would assume Howard got to use exclusively,  and I think if you watched the E! show, he also would send girls in to do random things.  It was that bathroom.  That very same.  It didn't look like that anymore.  No.  It completely stripped it down.  Yeah, dude, that studio outside of TV, man, it looked so different.  Like, now that you know where the angles were, you could see what it was,  but boy, I would have never have guessed that was the same studio. 
[03:28:30]  It's amazing how they did that.  Anyway, so one morning, well, one night, I was out in the city,  and it just, it got to a point where it was like, okay, there's no reason to go home.  It's so fucking late that to go home, you'd only just turn around and come back.  So I said, well, let me at least, I'll just go to the studio and crash there,  because at least it's a couch that I can crash on.  And you know you'll be at work on.  Right, exactly.  So, and no matter, and I was fucked up, man, let me tell you.  Was that the morning that you woke up and you're still a little fucked up? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, probably.  I remember.  I'll never, that was the longest day of my life, dude, because.  Because we were sitting there laughing, because you were sitting, you were looking,  you had obviously slept there, and you were looking at your computer,  but your eyes were not focused on anything, like you were still obviously in La La Land.  I remember, uh, it was just so goddamn bright, like my eyes couldn't deal with it,  and like they were tearing up because it was so bright,  and all I could remember was just trying to, trying to get the brightness down on the monitor  so that my eyes wouldn't tear up.  But, uh, yeah, you know what day that was, too?  That was the day that we did that boiled meat barbecue. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, that was not the day for that.  No, not the day for that.  And after that, that was the infamous meeting with Tracy Cloherty, who is the PD of K-Rock.  She didn't like you either.  No, she hated, well, she was a fucking twat.  Okay, that might be one reason.  She really was.  I mean, look, we can get into her, but she's a whole, she's a whole nother set of stories.  Yeah.  But, uh, that was the same day where she told us that, you know,  if we're doing a story about a, about a sheep, we shouldn't play little sheep noises.  And if we're talking about a cat, we should make little cat noises.  Well, that's all, it doesn't matter to the story, but that very morning, uh, I got up, 
[03:30:00]  I shot up from my non-sleep, and I was in the studio, and I had to shh.  You slept in the studio itself.  Yeah, on that leather couch that was there.  And boy, oh boy, I had to shit immediately.  And I got up, and it was kind of like woozy, and I'm like, oh, man, I'm fucked up, man.  Right.  And I get into the bathroom.  Now, this bathroom, it wasn't originally a bathroom.  It's not like when they built that, the floor plan, they said, we're going to put a bathroom here.  That was after the fact.  So this is like in the middle of the studio, there's just a bathroom, so there's no windows.  None. 
[03:30:30]  Pitch black.  It's two in the morning, three a.m.  Now, the door closes behind me.  I didn't turn, I didn't turn the light on.  Why?  I just, who thinks about it?  You just go, and then, you know, sometimes if the door closes behind you, you feel around, and you get the light on.  Flip the light on.  I started, it's pitch black, like there is no light.  Zero.  And I'm feeling around on the walls.  What do you got, grab some guy's junk?  I wish, I mean, maybe if our interns were there, but no, there was no interns at the time.  And so I'm in this bathroom, and I got to shit like crazy, and I'm feeling around on the walls, thinking, obviously I'm going to find, I'm going to get to a light switch. 
[03:31:00]  And I don't find one.  I don't find one.  So I go, okay, let me try to find the door handle to try to just get the fuck out.  And I figured if I could open the door, at least I can get some ambient light to come in, and I can see what I'm doing.  So you were all fucked up, and your orientation was all skewed, because there was nothing visual.  No light, like you know when it's pitch black, even like the LED, just a small LED light from a piece of electronics that's turned off, but there's just that little red light. 
[03:31:30]  You know how that can illuminate a room?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Not even a VCR clock flashing.  Exactly nothing.  And, you know, time is a ticking by.  And it's not like this all happened in the span of like 10 seconds.  Like, we're drawn out now into probably six minutes where I'm in a panic.  Like, I'm almost having a panic attack now.  You were in a, it wasn't a big bathroom.  Dude, no, it wasn't a big bathroom.  Six minutes?  Yes, absolutely, and I'll tell you why.  Because the light, everything in there was lower for some reason. 
[03:32:00]  Like, the light switch was like maybe a good 18 inches lower than you'd expect it to be.  The door handle was about a good 18 inches lower than you'd expect it to be.  I would think if you were in your normal state, though, within six minutes you could probably touch every square foot of that room.  Dude, it didn't matter.  The entire time I was, I was just holding in liquidy shit.  I was just, it was just liquidy shit.  And I had to go.  And it got to the point where like I had my, I had like my pants kind of down because like you're in the bathroom.  So you're just searching for a light switch with your pants down? 
[03:32:30]  Kind of, yeah, because I just want to get my ass over a fucking receptacle so I could just unload it.  And it got to the point I couldn't hold it anymore.  And it was like, oh, where did it go?  And then when I finally, well, I turned the light, I finally found the light.  As you were shitting?  I finally found the light and I turned it on.  Guys, let me tell you.  Where did the shit go?  On the floor.  Oh.  You guys remember, do you guys remember using that bathroom over at K-Rock?  Yeah.  Shit on the floor.  What would you clean it up with?  Well, I got the light on. 
[03:33:00]  I had to use my, I used the toilet paper that was in there.  And my socks were a casualty that day.  What'd you do with the socks?  Well, I think I ended up stepping in some of it as I was maneuvering around.  What's wrong with you?  I had to shit.  What'd you do with the socks after that?  I think I put them in a, I think I found a bag.  I tied them up in a bag and just threw them in my, threw them in my bag so no one would  find my shitty socks.  That's horrible.  Why would you, why would you not have told us right away?  Because that was an embarrassing one.  That one was really bad.  I had to wait a few years to, to, to come out with that. 
[03:33:30]  Plus you're still a little fucked up at the time.  So people would have been like, what are you doing, Danny?  Yeah.  Like, why would you?  That wouldn't have been a fun story.  Like that would have just been silence and like, hey, maybe it's time that you, you stopped  drinking.  Yeah.  We would have talked to your family.  Yeah, like when you, when you show up fucked up to work and you shat on the floor, like  maybe it's time to stop.  I got a funny story.  Did you air that room out?  No, there's no windows in there.  You didn't air the room out.  You didn't drop the door open a little bit?  Well, no, no, after the, I guess so.  I mean, I'm trying to remember as best I can, but I would imagine that I left the door  open, cleaned up as best as I could, and then went back out on the couch to try to 
[03:34:00]  fucking sleep with the rest of it off.  Yeah, it wouldn't have done much though, because the room was in it.  Did anybody come in and smell shit that day?  Well, the reason why I ask is because when, over there, when Ope first gets in, he grabs  a paper and goes to that bathroom.  So he would have been the first person in there right after you.  I mean, it wasn't like, it wasn't like I squoze like a whole bottle of Hershey syrup all over  the place.  You shit all on the floor.  It doesn't matter.  But there was definitely shit on the floor.  It was shit.  Liquidy.  Liquidy, chunky soups.  Because I went to the Duane Reade and Alex, I knew I was going to be hungry and I was  trying to prevent a hangover. 
[03:34:30]  So I got like those microwavable chunky soups.  Did it work?  Well, it just kind of came out, I guess.  Did it prevent the hangover?  No.  No.  So you shit on the floor.  I shit on the floor.  And you had a hangover.  I had bad chunky soup.  I shat on the floor.  And then I had to eat boiled tripe.  Oh, Danny.  You deserve that bad day though.  You did that to yourself.  Yeah, I did.  But I figured since we were talking about shitting.  Well, I'm glad.  I'm definitely glad you shared.  I killed a few minutes.  I did more than you.  You killed it for a few minutes.  That's what I did.  Kill the phones.  Well, they don't start calling until I tell them to. 
[03:35:00]  Oh.  Then they start.  If you've ever shat on the floor.  I don't want to hear.  Now is your chance to win a box set of the best Harvey Weinstein movie.  No, I'm only kidding.  We don't have that.  I wish we did.  Plus, if we did, we would have kept it for ourselves.  Yeah, you would never know.  We've done a lot of great movies.  Let's play as if that wasn't enough to learn today.  Larry in Michigan, what did you learn?  Well, I learned that the continuing saga of the Nopi and Jim show is continuing, and there's  no seemingly no end in sight to the Nopi and Anthony show. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  But more importantly, what I know, and I know it to the bottom of my heart, is that Hollywood  prime time, Sammy Sweetheart Roberts was so hosed over the busted open show that they  just don't realize the talent that they have on the bench.  Oh, why would you hang up on the left?  I get tired of this guy every day.  Danny, that's why you're not allowed in here.  I love having the phone.  That's why you're not allowed.  Bye.  Joker in Louisiana, what did you learn on the Nopi and Anthony show?  Sam, I learned that today was probably the most ballsy show you guys have ever put on. 
[03:36:00]  First, you have an intern that loved to play ball grab.  Second, you have Nopi who shat over his balls.  Yeah.  And third, you have the most ballsy individual in film in today with Mr. Weinstein.  I tell you, thank you, Joker.  Harvey Weinstein is just an awesome guest to have.  He is.  I mean, you go over it because, like, you know some of what he's produced.  But the guy, he also, he produces all these TV shows that you have no idea he's doing.  Like, he produces Mob Wives. 
[03:36:30]  He produces all these shitty TV shows that are ridiculously successful.  And Project Runway he produces.  But did you know what Jimmy's trying to bring up Howard Hughes and some little tidbit?  And then, just nonchalantly, Harvey has to go, oh, yeah, I know a lot about it because I produced a movie, you know, The Aviator.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So I read a lot about it.  He also does that.  The Aviator and Inglourious Bastards and every, I mean, the nutty professor he did.  And here's a guy, he's the head of a movie studio.  The head of a movie studio.  And he's the guy coming in to impress. 
[03:37:00]  I loved, uh...  Amazing.  I loved that Chris Tucker story.  Oh, yeah.  I can't believe he's never told that story.  Can you, I guess, because I had heard that Chris Tucker, like, went nuts when he got successful from Rush Hour.  And kind of just went crazy with his success, thinking he was bigger than he is.  And that's why he kind of disappeared.  But Harvey Weinstein said that he wanted to produce a Chris Tucker stand-up special.  With Tarantino.  And that's who would have directed it.  Tarantino is the director.  Harvey Weinstein is the producer, and they said Chris Tucker would get 50% of the profits. 
[03:37:30]  Weinstein would get 25%.  Tarantino would get 25%.  Chris Tucker came back to them and said, I would like 90% of all profits.  Well, guess who was sitting in the studio with us today?  I'll give you a hint.  It wasn't Chris Tucker.  Mike, in Virginia, what did you learn?  I learned that Anthony may be opening an experiment with some transsexuals soon.  He did?  How fucking fast did he crumble?  He did seem...  How fast did he crumble? 
[03:38:00]  I've never seen in a trap...  What?  Who's this?  The thing about transsexuals is, there are transsexuals who have good-looking girl faces.  There are transsexuals with, as they say, nice titties.  But the bottom line of everything is, they still have dicks.  That's what makes them transsexuals and not women.  And that's something you just always hold with you.  There's no transsexual that's good-looking enough for me to forget the fact that there's a dick between her legs. 
[03:38:30]  At all.  At all.  You know?  What if she hit it?  Like Silence of the Lambs?  Well, if I didn't know about it, I really couldn't object to it at first.  But once I found it, I'd be like, oh, no!  Would you fuck me?  No, I wouldn't.  And by the way...  I think our little Chris Tucker story is going to get some press today.  I'm getting a text message.  From who?  Just our friends over at a really big, big website.  What would Tyler Durden do?  Nope.  Even better.  What website?  Oh, a little film website called Slash Film. 
[03:39:00]  G-Baby texted you?  Oh, yeah.  From Ron and Fez.  He was in here the other day.  Well, yeah.  I mean...  Eric, are you going to cut that audio and give it to people?  Yeah.  We'll definitely put that out.  Yeah, that'll be a story today.  Absolutely.  Good.  Kevin in Kansas, what did you learn?  I learned that little Jimmy loved to say schmaltzy to a Jew, gentlemen.  Schmaltzy, schmaltzy.  Something about a schmaltzy wearing a schmaltzy.  I mean, that's how he described the film.  But I don't think it was because of the religion of Harvey Weinstein. 
[03:39:30]  I don't think that had that much to do with it.  Howard in Minnesota, what did you learn?  I learned that Sam Roberts is the whole of the O&A show.  Now, how do you figure that?  He means that you're the whole of it.  Like, you're all of the show.  Like, I'm the whole effing show?  That's what I would say.  Oh, thanks.  All right, Kevin.  Well, you were so concerned with Anthony texting while driving.  I mean...  Yeah, you're right, Howard.  The one thing...  That's how I bring the show down.  I don't want the host to be dead.  You're right. 
[03:40:00]  I mean, I just put the brakes on all the fun.  For instance...  Oh, stop.  Yeah.  That's the last thing, Anthony, that I want you to be dead.  Oh, no, you shouldn't do that.  Because the mark of a good on-air personality is somebody who's sitting there saying,  you know what would be cool, since we're all guys, if you did things that would make you dead?  Well, I just learned that on your show.  Do you know what is so much fun?  Have you ever disposed of batteries in a fire?  That is the fucking shit. 
[03:40:30]  Howard, are you still there?  Yeah, I am.  Okay, I want you to do me a favor.  Sure.  I want you to give...  Are you driving your truck?  Are you in a truck?  Yeah, I'm in a truck.  Okay.  You driving it?  Yep.  Okay, I want you to hang up the phone, and I want you to start texting everybody you know.  And whatever you do, don't slow down.  Do you do that for me?  And I do it all the time.  Just text everyone, where are.  Yeah.  Just go down the line on your contact list.  Every person in your book, where and the letter R, and send it to everyone you know, 
[03:41:00]  and one day, I hope to see you on a TV commercial trying to put your shirt on.  How does that make you feel, Howard?  Does that make me less of a hole?  Howard, I want you to suffer brain damage.  That's what I want for you.  You feel like the old Sam is back?  You okay, Sam?  All right.  Goodbye.  No, I'm fine.  You're the one who's not okay, Howard.  I remembered another poopy on the floor story.  Anthony just texted me and said, I'm not texting. 
[03:41:30]  Well, Anthony, then how did I get the text from you?  Anthony.  He had one of his little shortcuts, probably.  Listen, I worry about you.  It's probably S-T-F-U, Sam, and then that thing pops out.  This shortcut thing does not suffice.  This shortcut thing does not put me at ease.  I love hearing from you while the after show is on.  I don't want you to be texting while you're driving.  I worry so much about you.  I bet where are was probably a shortcut to this big old paragraph.  But he didn't put the space bar.  I bet all he had to do was hit that space and it was going to be a whole other fucking soliloquy of text. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not texting.  Anthony, you just sent me these things to worry me.  You need to take care of yourself.  Who else is going to?  If not you, speaking of taking care of yourself, Danny, I heard you have another shit on the floor story.  Well, I mean, we don't have to go there.  We should.  Well, we can.  We absolutely should.  Well, this one, boy, this one's a long time ago.  You know how many shit on the floor stories I have?  None?  Zero is the answer.  Correct answer.  You have a tight anus.  It works very well. 
[03:42:30]  No, my bowels release when I instruct them to.  Yeah, but you never get tricked.  I mean, that's how this happens.  No, I don't get tricked.  I got tricked.  Sometimes my anus outsmarts me.  One time when I was about six or seven years old, I think I had the flu or something.  I was a little sick, and I was in my pajamas, and they were the two-piece pajamas made out  of, like, the cotton ones with the red and blue stripes, and the pants matched the shirt.  Were they feetie?  No, no, no, no, no.  Just two-piece.  No feeties.  And I thought I had a fart, and so I farted, and then it was diarrhea all in my pajamas. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, well, see, that's it.  And then I went downstairs with my pajamas on, and I said, Mom, and she said,  Yes, Sammy?  And I said, I thought I had to fart, but it was diarrhea.  But she cleaned me up.  I didn't get any on the floor.  See, now, my story is pretty much identical to your story, except I was a little older.  Okay, that's the exception I was worried about.  It was junior high school.  That exception makes it unacceptable.  Yeah, it was probably, like, seventh or eighth grade, and I wasn't wearing anything. 
[03:43:30]  You were nude?  I was nude.  And where were you?  I was nude.  I was in my house.  And I had—everybody, I think, has one of these friends, like, where it's like, they're  your friend.  You are the friend, by the way.  They're your friend, but when they call you, it's like, ugh.  So I don't—because I know if this person is calling me, it's going to be 20 fucking  minutes on the phone, and it's going to be hell trying to hang up.  Yeah.  And back in the day, I had the phone—the main phone in my house had a, you know, fucking  80-foot cord on it, so you could just walk anywhere you kind of got to go, except for  the bathroom, I guess.  And so my friend Mike was on the phone, and all I had to do—I stayed home from school 
[03:44:00]  that day because I was sick.  So—because I was probably shitting all over the place.  And then so fucking Mike calls.  I'm like, fuck, it's Mike, because he's going to fucking be on the phone forever.  And the whole time on the phone, I'm like pacing around, and there's no one in my house  because it's like the middle of the day, so it doesn't matter.  And no one's home, so I'm nude.  I like to be nude around my house.  No, that's not—  It's fine.  It's fine.  You just take off your clothes when no one's around?  Well, I mean, if that's the case, I'm not going to run to cover up if there's no  one home.  You're a very sexual guy.  I can't be.  You're very—you're just a very— 
[03:44:30]  I can't be.  I ooze it.  You're a very sexual guy.  I have a lot of machismo.  I guess that's what it is.  So, uh, I know that something's happening in me.  You have a Scott Hall hairy chest?  I wish.  I was always jealous of his manliness.  Bet you were.  Like, greasy hair.  Anyway, so I'm pacing around over my mother's oriental rug that's in the living room.  Oh, no.  And I feel things happening.  And I'm like, Mike, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  I gotta go, Mike.  And he's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And I'm like, oh, what was he talking about?  Just nonsense, probably comic books or some shit or a video game. 
[03:45:00]  And, uh, so I'm on the phone, and this is, like, three and four times.  I'm like, Mike, I gotta go.  Mike, come on.  I gotta go, Mike.  I gotta run.  So, finally, I'm like, oh, you know what?  I don't think that this bubble I'm feeling is a problem.  I'm pretty sure that it's safe now to let this go.  I'd like to take an educated guess.  Yeah, and because Mike was just annoying me, I was like, fuck it, let me take the risk.  And so I went for what I thought was just gonna be a fun little, a fun little poot. 
[03:45:30]  A little toot?  And what was it?  Well, it was probably a streaming arc of liquidy shit onto an Easter-y pastel-colored oriental rug.  You're disgusting.  And then it was really time for me to go with Mike.  I said, Mike, I gotta go.  I just shit on the rug.  Shit on the rug, Mike.  Gotta go.  What did your mom say when she got home?  Dude, she never found out.  How?  I, this is, I think my brother was like, just born. 
[03:46:00]  So luckily, there was like a lot of just like, like shitty rags, you know?  Like, you know, the kid shits all over himself.  And you know, like, not just diapers, but you got, there's like those, those, those rags, too.  You just, you know, the disposable, I guess.  You just wipe them up and throw them away.  Dude, I just fucking, I just took a rag and just somehow, somehow, the shit didn't seep and soak into the rug.  And I got it all up.  You are disgusting.  I got it all up.  Probably still stunk in there, though.  Doesn't matter.  Do you understand?  Smelly, smelling house.  Do you understand? 
[03:46:30]  I was like James Bond of shitting on the floor.  No one knew.  I was like a fucking shitting ninja.  That, you didn't have to bring in.  I got in.  I took a shit.  I got out.  No one knew.  You shit on the rug.  You know.  All over that rug.  That's horrible enough.  I would watch company come over and stand right where I took a shit.  Roland, you're a big shitting guy.  Yes.  You shit yourself all the time, huh?  Yeah.  More often than you'd like.  I have many shitty stories.  I didn't mean for the show to go here today.  That's what happens.  More often than not on the show.  I'm very sorry.  And this is the part where I get tweets from people. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, boy.  It really was the shit show today.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  I've heard it before.  Sammy, I'm so sorry.  I've heard it before.  Hang on.  Roland, let's break up these stories.  I've had the Ron and Fez intern just have to listen to me tell a story about me shitting  on the run.  John in New Mexico.  Hey there, Sam.  What'd you learn?  I am learning, not learned, I am learning that every day that Opie is out sick is a  good day for the Miami Heat.  You're right, John.  That way you can't jinx them. 
[03:47:30]  Opie's not here to jinx them.  The sports curse is ineffective.  If Opie's not here to announce...  Opie just texted me.  Miami's going to win.  No, he didn't.  I know.  If Opie's not here to announce what team he's rooting for, the sports curse is out of  effect.  Don't interrupt.  I think that Roland was about to tell us a nice story.  Adam in Indiana, what did you learn?  I have many shit stories.  What's up, Adam?  I wanted to...  Something I learned on the show today was the fact that when the police arrived at Rodney  King's house, they actually jumped into the pool and beat him up.  That was a very funny visual that Anthony painted for us. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, all right.  Thank you, Adam.  Roland?  Roland, as you were.  I have many shit stories, but I went to a shit that seeped through a cab before.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hang on.  You shit in a cab?  Well, I went.  My buddy and Kevin and I were drunk walking through the park, Central Park, and I had to  shit.  And I said, I got to shit right now.  He goes, just go in the park.  So I thought I walked in pretty far, but I didn't.  So I was shitting on the grass, and we saw the Central Park cops light up for a few feet 
[03:48:30]  away from us, just screaming, stop there.  So he goes, run, run.  So I pulled up my pants, holding them, running.  He goes, I got a cab.  Jump in.  I jumped in and slid in.  And I realized my pants were down, and shit went all over the sea.  Oh, that's disgusting.  And the cab driver goes, what smells?  And my buddy goes, oh, they're pouring manure out there.  Just go, go, go.  And then he looked down, and he goes, oh, my God.  And we were in a red light, and he goes, run.  He got out of the cab, took off, and the cab driver turned back and went, oh, my God. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And it was all over his seat.  It was all over everywhere, and I just ran.  Why don't you guys control your bowels?  It just happened.  See, this is why you got to start drinking, Sam, and then you have all these fun shitting  in your pants stories to share.  You know, as many stories as I've heard, none of them have made me think, I really got  to drink more.  It's fun, though.  Yeah, see?  You don't have these memories to share.  Eric, last time you drank, you shat all over a hotel room.  See?  Yeah, that was my most recent, but there was one about a month or so before that, too.  A month before that? 
[03:49:30]  About maybe a month and a half before that.  What did you do?  I was coming back from Long Island, and it's like 1, 2 in the morning.  I'm on the Long Island Expressway right near where the Van Wick meets.  Yeah.  And I couldn't get to a bathroom in time.  It was just, it was going to come.  So right where the ramps were coming down onto the Long Island Expressway, I pulled my car  off to the side and then parked it diagonally.  So the oncoming traffic couldn't see it, and the ramp was high enough that the cars coming 
[03:50:00]  down couldn't see me.  Oh.  And I opened both passenger doors, and in between the passenger doors, I just kind of crouched  down.  Oh, Eric.  You fucking took a shit on the Long Island Expressway.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  So, and I didn't know where I was.  Was anyone with you?  No, I was coming home.  And I didn't know where I was at that point.  And then, so I did it, and then I'm going through the glove compartment, pulling out like  Subway and McDonald's napkins.  Yeah.  Because why would you have something from like Ranch One or something else? 
[03:50:30]  That's the healthiest thing I could think of.  So I clean up, and then as I'm driving past, I go, oh, I'm in Flushing.  Look, there's like the World's Fair thing.  Sure.  So I was like, all right, now I know where I was.  And so I had to remember to mark where I was shitting at two in the morning.  It's like burying the money in Fargo.  Eric took a dump where fucking, where men in black fought the cockroach.  Oh, Eric.  And you know, we tell all these, Ron and Fez have a lady intern.  I'm sorry. 
[03:51:00]  Had she ever shit in her pants?  I have not.  Really?  Not even by accident?  No.  She's a lady.  I have it.  People control themselves.  I don't shit myself.  I have another one if you want.  Yes, we want it.  Eric, why don't you, why don't any, all three of you, your bodies are just at war with you.  This happens everywhere.  I'm telling, I just told you all the shit stories ever.  I doubt that.  Ever.  No, I got one more.  But it's not that fucking good.  Another late night driving back from Long Island.  Just stop going to Long Island.  It's not working out for you.  And it starts going, I'm like, oh, so I pull off, I'm hoping like there's like a McDonald's 
[03:51:30]  or something there and there's nothing around, but there's a-  Yeah, but what about to shit?  What?  You were hoping there was a McDonald's, implying that you just wanted to get some food.  So there's a bank, right?  So I'm like, oh, there's a bank, but all the lights are off and everything.  So I'm like, oh, I think there's woods behind that bank.  So I pull around and there's no woods, it's fenced in, but they have this big dumpster.  So I just kind of pulled my car and then went behind the dumpster right onto the parking  lot.  Eric shits like a homeless person.  What do you stop shitting at work and at my house? 
[03:52:00]  What do you wipe with?  When you do it on the side of the road and behind banks.  It's usually napkins I have in the car.  Does your wife know you do this?  I've told her many times.  Why?  Why would I not tell her?  That's why the romance is gone.  What does she think about this?  She laughs, but she thinks it's disgusting.  That's why the romance is gone.  We were talking about this with Bob Kelly yesterday.  If she's listening, text Sam and she'll tell you about some of this stuff.  That's why the romance is gone.  Did your wife ever pull over on the side of the road and take shits?  No.  If she did, she never told me.  Has she ever shit herself?  I'm sure she has, but she doesn't. 
[03:52:30]  What makes you so sure?  I'm quite sure that my wife has not shit herself.  But it happens to everybody.  But why would she tell you, really?  It happens to the best of us.  Ron and Fez is interned Sam, not this Sam.  Well, she's a lady.  Female, Sam.  She's not going to openly admit.  She just told us she did not shit herself.  Yeah, but she also knows that she's broadcasting to people.  I would admit it.  You would admit it, right?  Yeah, I would admit it.  I haven't done it.  But you know Eric's wife did.  But Eric is...  I don't know for sure.  You just said sure.  No, I said I'm sure she has.  Then you know for sure. 
[03:53:00]  No, I don't.  I don't have a story.  But that's...  But you...  What word did you use?  I'm what she has.  I'm sure she has.  Okay, then.  That's for sure.  That's why they say for sure.  Like, if you ask me, did you shit your pants?  I'm sure you have.  Right.  Like, that's like...  Definitely.  Like, I don't know a story, but I'm sure I will get one.  It's like, Chinese food equals bad shits.  So why do you eat Chinese food?  I don't know.  I did that before, like two years ago.  Went on a blind date.  Ate Chinese food.  She goes, let's go back to my place. 
[03:53:30]  I just shit like a racehorse.  Went back to her bathroom.  And I did that shit flush.  Oh.  And then, every time I shit flush, shit flush, I couldn't stop shitting.  It's like a half hour.  I got out of there, and then she goes, I'll be back.  And when she flushed the toilet, I could hear the flushing from her living room.  So she knew exactly how many times I flushed.  Do you ever...  And then I ended up, she goes, okay, you can go now.  I'm like, all right.  Do you ever question, like, what am I doing?  Like, you and Danny, not so much, because he's not shitting himself every other month,  but do you and Eric ever question, like, what am I doing to my body that this is happening? 
[03:54:00]  I do, when I go, why did I eat that?  Exactly.  It's not just one meal.  It happens too often for that...  It's the way you live your life.  You live your life like somebody who shits themselves too much.  Yeah, it's like a pagan temple.  Like, stomach.  No, no, it's not like any kind of temple.  I remembered another story.  Of course you did.  When was this?  The month before the last one?  1999.  1999.  Ah, raining in the millennium.  So, Eric's gonna shit like it's midnight.  We're gonna shit.  Well, it's funny you say that.  I was working for this radio station on Long Island. 
[03:54:30]  WPLJ?  No.  You shit on Scott and Todd?  WLIR?  Well, it looks like his face is...  Well, yeah, I was working there, but it was called Party 105.  Nice.  It's an East Long Island dance club station.  So, they're doing out east, in Riverhead, they're doing their Millennium Mega Jam concert,  right?  And I'm working there, and at some point, I realized I had to ship, but I couldn't get to  anywhere near where the port-a-potties were.  So, backstage, behind the actual stage itself, they had these industrial cable spools that 
[03:55:00]  were just laying on their sides.  Come on.  And so, there was nobody back there.  I just kind of sat on the spool and just hung over in the circle there.  You're disgusting.  You're disgusting.  I could listen to Eric shitting all day.  Like, at least Danny, like, he shit...  Every time he shit embarrassingly, it was by mistake.  Like, Eric was like, I'm making a life choice right now.  Like, for the rest of my life, I will be a guy who shit in this pool of cables.  I have a shit...  I have one more shitting in my pants.  Where's Troy?  Bring Troy in here. 
[03:55:30]  And I have one embarrassing shitting at someone's house.  So, I guess you guys could pick which one you want.  Anybody have a preference?  Both.  Well, one time I was kind of dating this girl.  Like, we were seeing each other, and wherever the hell we were, I don't remember, we were  just out, and I think it was suggested that we go back to the apartment.  And I had a shit, like, I didn't make any lies.  I was just like, I think we should probably get back to your house, like, you know, as 
[03:56:00]  soon as we possibly can.  And I remember, like, the cramping, like, dude, it was so bad that I was driving, and  like, I'm driving around Astoria, and you know how parking is in Astoria, and if you  don't, it's just non-existent, and I'm trying to find a parking spot, and my stomach is  cramping up to the point, like, where my leg is actually, like, slowly lifting up off  of the pedals, and I'm actually, I'm not even driving anymore, I'm just holding the wheel  and idling down the street because I have to shit so badly.  So I finally find a spot, finally go upstairs, I just run into the bathroom, I fucking blew  up the entire house, like, it wasn't even, it was one of those shits where it fucking, 
[03:56:30]  it was concentrated, it was just pure, concentrated evil.  And fucking ten minutes later, her roommate comes home, and the entire house just stinks  like shit, and she had to explain to her roommate that I had to take a big shit.  By the way, Sonny Ferrelli's already on the phone saying, I wonder why they call this  the shit show, there's no way I'm picking up your call.  Troy, are you surprised, have you been listening to E-Rock? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, of course.  Like, again, Danny, like, these things happen, it sounds like for Danny it's more of an uncontrollable,  I hate to be here, whereas E-Rock is making choices in his life.  Yeah.  Are you surprised that E-Rock is in positions where he's shitting on the highway, and shitting  behind banks, and shitting offstage?  No, I've seen it when I was sitting in that room with him, like, he would just have to  run out to go shit.  Why do you think that is?  Because he's putting garbage in his body.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Eric, what do you think?  We're gonna do this discussion again.  I just, well, Eric, the reason we have to keep having it is because nothing changes. 
[03:57:30]  No, but if everyone else has great shit stories, they're not, well, yeah, I understand,  but it's a big difference, but the last great shit story I have is, was from five years ago  because I was hammered out of my brain.  Listen, Danny's-  Your shit stories are because you just had to take a shit on the highway.  Yeah.  And Danny's were either accidental or because of his acute alcoholism, which we can deal  with at any point.  It is cute.  But, but again, like Danny said, dealing with Danny's problems are gonna end up with calling 
[03:58:00]  his family and bringing him into a room and saying, look, we all care about you.  So that's for another time.  And Roland, we, Roland skirts out of here.  We say the exact same stuff to Roland.  Yeah.  He's got a horrible problem.  Why do you think Roland shits all the time?  Because his diet's awful.  He puts horrible things into his body.  Yeah.  All right?  So you're not the only one, Eric.  But listen, when we're, the reason the conversation always comes back to that is because we'll have  the conversation with you and then you'll have a Whopper with extra mayo for breakfast.  And it's like, and then tell an awesome story about pulling your car over diagonally on 
[03:58:30]  the L.I.E. so that you can take a shit between your passenger doors.  Like, I thought it was great.  Do you understand?  I'm never gonna be able to drive past the fucking Flushing Meadows Park ever again.  You'll see that orange ramp coming down.  I'm gonna see that big fucking Unisphere and just think about your chubby little legs.  Fucking popping a squat in the breakdown lane.  I have a great shitting sound.  I think I've told it on this after show, actually.  The one where I drank Epsom salt. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you made the sounds and everything.  Well, yeah.  Do you have those sounds anywhere in Dilett that Eric can play real quick?  I don't know.  Is that the same stuff that we gave No Filter Paul?  Is that the same stuff?  I think so, yeah.  That was great.  I never knew Epsom salt could do that.  Yeah.  But that's another thing.  Like, you also, you were like, oh, this is a diuretic or a whatever.  Diuretic, yeah.  Yeah, like, this is gonna make me shit, so I'll take it.  Like, that's like everything Eric eats.  And Roland, by the way.  And Roland, Eric, you're right.  I'm being fair.  It's also everything Roland eats.  No, I don't.  Then why are you shitting so much? 
[03:59:30]  Why are you shitting in cabs?  Because we both eat.  It's not good.  It's all the grease, all the awful food.  I mean, less of this.  I haven't shitting my pants since I was last.  I'd be scared for my life if my shitting habits were like this.  Yeah, especially at a young age.  Yeah, I'd be like, oh, no.  This is not good.  Like, when Jim Brewer comes in and tells stories about his dad shitting, I shouldn't be relating  to it.  Right.  Like, I shouldn't be like, oh, yeah, that happened to me.  Not the fact that my elderly dad did it.  The fact that I did it. 
[04:00:00]  That shouldn't be happening.  I was sitting back in the office going, mm-hmm, I've been there.  Yeah.  You go, girlfriend.  But since I haven't been eating less of that, I haven't.  It's changed, right?  Yeah, I haven't.  Like, Troy and I went bike riding.  Have you laid off the glutens yet, Eric?  Uh, no.  You're not supposed to yet.  If you're going to get tested for it, you're not supposed to change your diet so they can  test it.  Eric, you don't need to get tested.  That's a waste of time.  Trust me.  I know.  You need to go gluten-free.  Yeah.  You know, I saw a funny tweet that said something about, it is, contrary to belief, it is actually 
[04:00:30]  possible to eat gluten-free without telling everybody about it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that would be nice.  That's the new thing.  Yeah.  But you've got to tell people when you're eating because, you know, restaurants have-  There's a pizzeria that's right near me and they're big, like, biggest day, even before  you know that they have pizza.  It's like, we are gluten-free.  And it's like, well, that's great.  What is it?  Yeah, but, I mean, at a pizzeria, that would be a selling point because it just doesn't  It's just more butter, though, too, so you have to be careful.  It is?  Well, Eric, you don't need your bowels getting all lubed up with butter, do you? 
[04:01:00]  No, he's jumping up and down now.  I'm gluten.  You can probably have gluten.  You just got to make sure you watch everything you're putting in your body.  And exercising.  But he gets his tummy upset.  Yeah, but that's like people that say, like, you know, they're, what's it called when you  get sick from dairy?  Lactose intolerant.  Yeah, I mean, it's just like one of those things, too.  Like, if you're watching, you're just balancing your entire diet out, everything will be fine.  If you're exercising regularly, but if you're not exercising and you're not sleeping right  and you're fucking putting garbage in your body.  You're not sleeping right.  Don't talk about sleeping right. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, but I also try to make up for it on the other end, right?  Make sure I juice every day.  I make sure I...  You can't make up for not sleeping right.  Yes, you can.  No, you can't.  As long as you're putting good nutrients.  It's not, you know, it's not good for you.  You're going to die.  How many hours of sleep do you get, on average?  Sometimes none.  See what, and he'll do no sleep nights, like, multiple times a week.  That's not healthy.  No, you can't do that.  Yeah.  I start hallucinating.  Right, exactly.  You can drink it.  Maybe I'm going to start staying up on me.  But, like, people that go into the fucking, you know, Afghanistan and shit do that.  I know, and they're not healthy.  Well, I mean, you got to do what you got to do, you know? 
[04:02:00]  You're not in Afghanistan.  You're DJing a club.  But you got to do what you got to do to get ahead, you know what I mean?  Like, what do you do?  You can die young.  I'm going to shoot some beats at you.  It's not healthy.  And Eric, you should remind Troy that next time he's on you about your...  Yeah.  His sleep...  Your sleep is no better than Eric.  If I had the salary Eric had, I wouldn't have it to do this.  Is that what it is?  Oh, my God, I'd be sitting fucking fat.  Well, yeah, that's what Eric's doing.  Eric, but you should.  You should watch your...  You should watch out...  The way Troy watches out for you, you should watch out for your friend Troy. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, but that's just negligence.  He just doesn't want to take it.  Negligence.  He just doesn't want to take it.  We got to go...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's out there.  Somebody works for the New York City Department of Transportation.  There is video out there, surveillance video of Eric taking a shit on the L.I.E.  Please, somebody find it.  I need to see it.  We'll get to that.  I need it.  And the bike story.  And the bike story.  Well, no time for that today.  Because Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Hopefully, with the return of Opie.  Goodbye, everybody.  See you in Austin.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. 
[04:03:00]  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
