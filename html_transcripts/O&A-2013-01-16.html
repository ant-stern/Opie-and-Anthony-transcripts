<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, Jim Norton, and Sam Roberts discussing New York's (and soon, potentially federal) gun control legislation.  Anthony vehemently opposed the laws, focusing on magazine capacity limits, potential confiscation, and the vague mental health reporting provision.  The discussion, rife with homophobic and misogynistic slurs, also covered the perceived political motivations behind the legislation, the practical difficulties of enforcing magazine restrictions, and a comparison of similar-looking firearms.  They digressed into topics like the frustrations of dining out with children, the history and absurdity of wigs and comb-overs, and an offensive segment referencing an "All in the Family" episode.  They briefly touched on Tracy Morgan's homophobic remarks and the complexities of free speech for comedians.  The segment concluded with a review of *Promised Land* and observations about Hal Holbrook's aging appearance.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Martin Sheen's film career, focusing on "That Certain Summer," a 70s TV movie about a boy dealing with his father's homosexuality. The hosts shared their childhood reactions to the film and anecdotes about watching it.  This transitioned into a discussion of Opie's recent travels, including humorous encounters with Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta at an airport involving seat mix-ups and failed photo attempts.  They debated airline travel comfort and the absurdity of complaining about flight delays.  A fictional, vulgar skit involving a mafia hitman, Lyle Chipperson, followed, along with discussion about listener reactions to the hosts eating on air, which sparked further vulgar exchanges.  Jim Norton then detailed his experiences taping a prank show with Russell Peters and Paul Rodriguez for TBS, appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast (including an anecdote about a car door incident), getting a massage from "Ingrid the Muscle Whisperer," and the competitive podcasting world.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Rogan podcast and the desire to add a visual element to the Opie and Anthony show.

The next segment began with another anecdote about an awkward encounter with Joe Pesci on a flight and the difficulties of online photo sharing. The conversation then moved to Lance Armstrong's confession and the hypocrisy surrounding his actions.  A significant portion featured in-studio guest "E-Rock," who pitched a confusing and poorly developed time-travel movie concept.  The hosts mercilessly ridiculed the plot holes.  The discussion returned to New York's gun control legislation with a caller expressing anger and frustration over the rapid enactment of restrictions and the slower implementation of enhanced penalties for criminals.  The caller also discussed potential federal gun control measures, state reactions (especially Texas), media portrayals of gun violence, and lack of political accountability.  The show briefly mentioned upcoming guests Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, their recent media appearances related to gun control, and other entertainment events the hosts would be attending.  A listener-sent beef jerky was also mentioned.

A substantial portion of the show focused on professional wrestlers who lost their ring names after Vince McMahon bought ECW's intellectual property.  E-Rock (again) and the hosts listed examples (Bubba Ray Dudley/Bully Ray, Balls Mahoney/Cajonies, Billy Gunn/Heine Guy), expressing anger at McMahon.  The conversation then centered on Bully Ray's upcoming storyline wedding to Brooke Hogan in TNA, highlighting Hulk Hogan's displeasure. Audio clips of their on-screen conflict were played, accompanied by crude jokes about Brooke Hogan's appearance.  Jim Norton then discussed his frustrations in the comedy world, recounting an encounter with Kevin Bacon where Bacon didn't recognize him.  This led to Norton's commentary on his perceived lack of success and superficial show business interactions.  The segment concluded with Norton taking calls for his advice show.  The entire segment was filled with profanity and sexually explicit discussions.

The final segment featured Jim Norton's advice segment.  Callers discussed creative slumps, depressing marriages, publishing books, interactions with celebrities, and a tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  Norton engaged in numerous sexually explicit bits, including a graphic description of a product to mask the taste of semen, crude advice on sexual encounters, and discussions about sex addiction and premature ejaculation. He also discussed his experiences with sleep apnea and CPAP machines, a listener's financial struggles with mandatory sleep apnea testing, and his reluctance to train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Throughout, Norton used frequent profanity and made sexually suggestive and offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with Norton advertising Steven Singer Jewelers and preparing for a television appearance.

I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, you'll be in Anthony's show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time?  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  It's his cock.

[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road  Hi  Let me turn up my headphone  There it is, ha ha, noises  Good morning  I gotta clear my throat  There we go  How's that beef jerky? 
[00:05:30]  It's pretty goddamn good  I got a big thing of beef jerky  I guess I was talking about it the other day  Because there was some over there  But the lid was off  And I didn't want to take any chances  With people trying to purrs in me  So somebody sent  A big thing of beef jerky  And it was sealed  So I cracked it open today  And I do like a good jerky  I gotta be honest with you  I don't know why  It's all dry  It's like tree bark 
[00:06:00]  Yeah  But it's very flavorful  You gotta say  It's pretty good goddamn jerky  It's survivalist food, you know  You can pack it away  And just in case something happens  Boy, you pop that shit right in your mouth  It's pretty goddamn good  I guess I hope he's rejoining us today  He probably just landed  He took the right eye  But it's sleeting out  It is terrible out  I'm so glad I stayed in the city  Because the thought of driving in from Long Island today  Would have been a nightmare  I would have been screaming and yelling 
[00:06:30]  And all in a tizzy  By the time I got in  But he's coming from Newark  So he's gonna get some of that  What they call tunnel traffic  Yeah  He'll be in by 7.30  Yeah, he'll be in  In the meantime, I mean, boy  Look what you got here  You got the James Norton  Myself, Anthony Akumia  The lovely and talented Sam Roberts  And of course  The professional of the room  Mr. Dr. Gay  I thought you were gonna talk about our screenwriter 
[00:07:00]  Well, and of course, our screenwriter  Mr. Nagel, of course  I put him in the category  Like with the writers, directors  Things like that  Spielberg, Lucas  Nagel  He's more of a guest now  Later on in the show  Filmmaker Eric Nagel will be here  Filmmaker  Author Eric Nagel  Yes  Screenwriter Eric Nagel  Yeah, what inspired you to write that?  That dreck 
[00:07:30]  Yeah  It's dreck  What inspired you to write  The hateable man in the future?  Has anybody gotten any line on what his  The name of this feature is?  He hasn't spilled the beans, huh?  He has not  He's shoveled them in his mouth  But he hasn't spilled them  I don't think he knows  No, I don't think he does either  Yeah, I think that  What he told us yesterday  Yeah  Is all the ideas  Yeah, that's everything  I don't think there's any secrets  That haven't been told  I think it's just like  Oh, no, I got other ideas 
[00:08:00]  But I don't want to give it away  I ain't gonna give them away  Because I know these people  What they do  They steal your ideas  That's what he's thinking  So, well  I'm not gonna go off on a tear  Like I did yesterday  That's for sure  That was like an hour of screaming  And yelling about gun control  You needed it  I did need it  It's very therapeutic  It's okay to do it here  Cathartic, yes  And I was getting a lot of tweets  Last night  And yesterday  About my rant  And whatnot 
[00:08:30]  And a lot of people saying  Hey, Anthony, I'll buy your 30-round magazines  Those are the 30-round magazines  That go on the guns  And now they're gonna be illegal  In New York State  In one year  That's how long you got  To get rid of them  And replace your  Your 10-round magazines  With 7-round magazines  So everybody from other states  Are going  Anthony, I'll take your 10-round mags  Give me your 10-round mags  And I'm like  Do you watch the news?  Do you watch the fucking news?  Because Mr. Obama today 
[00:09:00]  I think somewhere around 11 o'clock or so  Is going to be at the White House  With Vice President Biden  Surrounded by children  Yes, surrounded by children  Sure  What are they doing?  Are they doing porn movies?  No, they're not doing porn movies  With the President and Vice President  At the White House  With children  What are they doing with them then?  All hanging out?  Just standing there?  What they're gonna be doing 
[00:09:30]  Goddammit  Is announcing new federal gun legislations  Yesterday was just New York State  Which now has what they're calling  The toughest gun laws in the country  The federal laws now are coming out  And of course they call it  The legislation against gun violence  Against gun violence  Because otherwise you're  You're pro-gun violence then?  Yes  I don't understand  I am pro-gun violence 
[00:10:00]  It's how they word these bills  It's another aspect of it  That's infuriating  When they were trying to  Keep gays from getting married  They didn't say the  Anti-gay marriage bill  They called it  The Marriage Protection Act  Or whatever it is  Yes  Sanctity of marriage act  To save the sanctity of the marriage  Between man and woman  Because they never want a bill  That takes anything from people  Whether it's a right  Or equipment  Whatever it is  Is anti-abortion anti-abortion? 
[00:10:30]  No, it's pro-life  It's pro-life  Pro-choice  Pro-choice  It's pro-both things  How could it be?  There's a fucking kid  Getting fucking sucked out  Someone's losing here  When you're trying to figure it out  You're like  I'm not against people being alive  I guess I'm pro-life  No, but I don't  But I like abortions  I'm for choices  I'm for choices  Yeah  Pro-choice  This is how they word these things  Because it's all semantics 
[00:11:00]  And if you word it like  People are going to be deprived of something  People start going  Hey, wait a minute  You're not supposed to do that  You're the government of the people  You're taking stuff away  No, we're giving you safety  Because this is an anti-gun violence bill  Right, all we're taking away is the violence  The violence  Oh, good  Oh, right  I would love to see the violence that goes away  Because I don't think any violence is going to be going away because of this 
[00:11:30]  Are they really going up there with kids?  Yes, so they're surrounding themselves with little children that apparently after the Sandy Hook incident  These children had written letters to the White House  You know, asking that the president make the schools safer  And so they're going to have a bunch of these children  A bunch of gun, anti-gun advocates  Or, wait, wait, anti-gun, stop 
[00:12:00]  Wait, wait, anti-violence advocates  Thank God  Are going to be there  Including the mayors against gun violence  And if you're not in that group  Then you're mayor  You're a mayor for gun violence  How do they even get elected?  Who's going to watch these kids?  I think their parents will probably be there, Uncle Paul  As will the president  The vice president  Secret service  I think they're going to be very well protected 
[00:12:30]  These children  They need someone to watch them  While the president's talking  Who would you suggest, Uncle Paul?  I'll go in there and take them in the other room  Quiet in there  The president's making big decisions  Dropping bombs on people  Get in here  Everybody get under the table  Why under the table?  Because a bomb might fall on your head  That would frighten the children unnecessarily  Everybody pile into the small closet  Little small space  Everybody get in here  Now, why would you do that, Uncle Paul?  That's perfectly safe at the White House  Timothy, the back of your head 
[00:13:00]  Oh, look what I feel  Guess what's on the back of your head, Timothy  What is it, Uncle Paul?  Guess Uncle Paul's behind you  What's on the back of his head, Uncle Paul?  Surprise from Uncle Paul  It's a trouser snake  A trouser snake?  Wow  Right at the White House  That's a ballsy move from Uncle Paul  I think a lot of people will be watching those kids  Uncle Paul has an addiction  Imagine a child gets molested in a closet by Uncle Paul 
[00:13:30]  At the White House  The scandal  The pure scandal  You know what you need to do?  You need to lower the age  People can fall in love  Fall in love  Ah, the love act  Right  Is what it is  Not the child molestation act  Sure  It would be the love act  You're pro-snugness  Pro-velvet-like grip  Ah, alright  That's a velvet-like grip  Yeah, so that's happening 
[00:14:00]  Some people criticizing the president  For showboating  With the children  Because obviously it harkens back to the tragedy at Sandy Hook  I guess the idea is  If you're watching  You go  Well, I don't want those kids to get shot  Right  So  Yeah, I'll side with him  The children you see here today  Are  Children that have written me  With hopes of  Safety  It's going to be one of those 
[00:14:30]  Speeches  I want those kids to be safe  Yes  Then he's going to propose  Gun legislation  Which is going to include  An assault weapons ban  Very similar to the one that was just  Enacted in New York State  Which means  A semi-automatic rifle  With  One  Or more  Military-like  Kind of things on it  Accessories  Good  Accessories 
[00:15:00]  Good, good, good  Well, there was a  Very good example on Fox News this morning  Of two weapons  They showed one that said  Would be banned  And one that wouldn't be banned  They are identical  Except for the fact that  The pistol grip type  Handle  Is incorporated into the stock  A little more  On the one  As opposed to the illegal one  The way the gun functions  The way it's held  The way it's  Has no difference  Also a ten round  Limit  On magazines  Not seven? 
[00:15:30]  Nationwide  Well, in New York  It'll still be seven  But nationally  Unless other states  Enact laws like New York did  But the national blanket  Over all the states  Will make it  A ten round  Maximum magazine  What are they now?  Thirty  Thirty round max  But everybody  Is also talking  And these are people  That  The people that are educated  On guns  Understand  It's very easy  To change out a magazine  In the  In the chaos  Of a mass shooting 
[00:16:00]  No one waits  To see him drop his clip  And pop a new one in  You actually have  More  You're more up  To jam your weapon  With a thirty round magazine  Than you are with  Ten round magazines  You just drop it out  And pop a new one in  And in the meantime  You can have a pistol  To hold off anyone  That would try to  Get you while you're  Popping a mag out  It's easy to do with one hand  So the magazine thing  Is it will do nothing  Again  For  Safety reasons  Now a lot of people  Have also been asking  Why would you need  A thirty round magazine 
[00:16:30]  It's ludicrous to think  You need that many bullets  Seven rounds  In a defensive  Atmosphere  Where I would have  A rifle  Semi-automatic rifle  With seven rounds in it  If you get a home invasion  And I'm not saying  It happens  I'm not trying to sound paranoid  I'm not  I'm not blurting out things  Though that never happen  These things do  Occasionally happen  The odds  Astronomical  Will it probably happen  No it probably won't  But I don't like  The idea of probabilities  I like knowing that  I'm safe  And other people  Have the right  That's what it is 
[00:17:00]  It's the right  To protect yourself  In the way you see fit  If you get four people  Coming in your house  And it's happened  There have been  Home invasions  Where three  Four people  Have come in the house  Even two people  Coming in the house  That are armed  What are you  Fucking  Annie Oakley  Seven rounds  Is not a lot of rounds  To shoot at somebody  I know one thing  I would love  To rattle off  Thirty rounds  Of ammunition  At anyone  Charging into my house  I don't want to be  Limited  To seven rounds 
[00:17:30]  Now again  I'm very proficient  So I will just  Change clips  I'm like that  Look out  But  You know  In a lot of instances  Thirty round magazines  Sound crazy  When they're presented  The way the media  And anti-gun people  Present them  It's like  You don't need it  Honestly  You do  You do  In order to  Protect yourself  It might not be  Necessary  But I kind of  Like having it  That's all  And again  Anybody who  Wants to commit  A crime  And needs a 
[00:18:00]  Thirty round mag  Which by the way  Is barely ever  Used in crimes  Can get their  Hands on it  It's easy  To obtain  Through overseas  Sales  On the internet  And they will  Send it  Believe me  I don't think  People in Croatia  Give a flying fuck  That they're mailing  An illegal magazine  To the United States  How do you get  The money to them  Probably  Anything  PayPal  Any company like that  That does that kind of business  The same as  If they could shut  Gambling down  They could easily  Shut down these  Big magazine shipments 
[00:18:30]  Couldn't they  I don't think so  How about you go to a store  And get one of those  Credit cards  That you just  Automatically put cash into  There's no way  To trace it back  To yourself  You send it to  A PO box  And meanwhile  The Croatian  Fucking place  Doesn't only sell  Magazines  They sell all kinds  Of stuff that is  Completely legal  So to be able  To check  There's no kind  Of going to be  An international  Watchdog  On what  Fucking  Guy from  Croatia  Is shoving a magazine  In a box  To ship over here 
[00:19:00]  So  If you want it  You will be able  To get it  Here it is  Come and get it  But you better  Hurry  Because  If you want it  There  You're going to be  Able to get it  So again  These laws  Are  Against  Law abiding  Citizens  People that  Have been  Paying attention  To gun laws  And  People  That are now  Going to be in a position  Where they are going to  Perhaps unwittingly 
[00:19:30]  Become  Criminals  A lot of people  Are going to have to  Register  Their weapons  Now  I have to go  At some point  Within the next year  And register  Probably up to  Ten of my guns  With the police department  It's  I'm already registered  I don't understand  This aspect of it  All of my guns  When I bought them  The paperwork  Is there  It was sent  To the feds  With the serial number  Of my rifle  My name  My address  My check  My security check 
[00:20:00]  Background check  Everything's been done  So why now  Do I have to  Bring it down  Somewhere  I don't know yet  I don't know  What the whole logistics  To this thing are  But I'm sure  It's going to cost me  Money also  I'm sure there's going  To be a fee  With every one  Of my guns  To now register them  Why do I have to do that  A lot of people  Are speculating  Perhaps that  It's a lot easier  To know  What guns people have  And perhaps  If they do have  Some of these  Illegal attachments  Like magazines  Or a forward pistol grip  Or something like that  And they could  Check that out  They will  Know where to look 
[00:20:30]  If they're looking  For guns  Or if there is  A future confiscation  Of guns  There's a big list  Of where they have  To go to get them  They don't just have  To knock on random doors  Now they just  Pull out their list  And go  Well we've enacted  A new law  Because this one  Did nothing  And there's more  Shootings  And more death  And destruction  So now we're  Going to take away  These assault weapons  And thank you  For you  Already going down  And registering them  It makes it that much  Easier for us  To take them  Also  The fact that 
[00:21:00]  I'm grandfathered in  I still have the weapons  I still have the weapons  But the magazines  I'm going to have  To get new ones  And I honestly  Don't know where  To get those  I don't understand  The aspect of  The registering weapons  If someone could  Explain that to me  I'd be happy to listen  I don't get it  I'm all ready  Is it just another step  To make it more inconvenient  Yes  I'm sure  But there could be  Something a little  More dastardly  Behind it  And I wouldn't  Put it past  The government  To keep tabs 
[00:21:30]  On who has these guns  In case they do  Have a future  Confiscation bill  That comes through  Do they already know?  Yeah  That's just it  I don't understand  Maybe it's a more  Organized list  You know  Knowing what you  Still have  Knowing what you  Hadn't sold off  To somebody  But the thing is  There's going to be  A lot of people  That don't know  These laws  I'm very  I mean  The second the law  Comes out  I read the whole thing  There are people  Though that don't  Read the laws  We know that  It doesn't make them  Bad  It just makes them  You know  They're ignorant  Of the law 
[00:22:00]  They're going to get  They're going to get  In trouble  These are legal  Law-abiding citizens  That have done  Nothing wrong  The only thing  They've done wrong  Is not read the laws  So they're going to  Maybe go to a gun range  Have a 30 round mag  There's going to be  A cop next to them  In the next booth  Shooting  Going hey  What are you doing  Oh I'm shooting  Oh really  You know that's illegal  And now he's got  A fucking  Record  And he's committed 
[00:22:30]  A crime  Now meanwhile  Criminals  They're going to be doing  What the fuck  They've done  Forever  This gun legislation  Is going to do  Nothing about that  So what you're doing  So what you're doing  Really is criminalizing  People that have done  Nothing but exercise  Their second amendment  Right legally  And you're putting  Them in a position  Now where they have  To jump through a lot  Of different hoops  Now in order to  Remain compliant  And not be a criminal  Right  I don't get it  It seems like it  Relates directly to 
[00:23:00]  Sandy Hook  Like it's the one  Like all of this  Is just based on  That one incident  One incident  You're right  Like the idea being  That now that it's  More of a pain in the ass  The next crazy kid  Won't have a mom  Who has a gun full  A closet full of guns  Well the truth of the matter  Is there was already  An assault weapons ban  In Connecticut  There is already  And was  Before Sandy Hook  An assault weapons ban  In Connecticut  I mean it's  It's ludicrous 
[00:23:30]  But people don't know that  They don't know  What else to say  Yes  When they say  Ban assault weapons  That just sounds like  The right thing  To do and say  Right  Even though it's  You said there's  Already those bans  It just sounds like  Something that makes  Them feel good to say  Because you can't  Ban guns overall  It's not going to happen  There are people  That would love to  But it would be like  Prohibition  Once people have guns  You're right  But it's a slow rollout  Of this legislation 
[00:24:00]  And this is a very  Quick rollout  Based on what  Happened at Sandy Hook  A lot of things  Transpire after a tragedy  Like this  Knee jerk reactions  People that honestly  Want some kind of safety  And political aspirations  When you saw  A Cuomo  Andrew Cuomo  Talking about  This gun legislation  I swear  I thought I was  Watching an old  Fucking clip of  Hitler from  Nuremberg  The guy's yelling  He's yelling  He's waving his hands  He's talking about  Guns  I mean 
[00:24:30]  If that wasn't  His initial foray  Into the 2016 election  I don't know  What the fuck was  Obviously the guy's  Posturing himself  For a run  At the presidency  So  His sincerity  On safety  I have my doubts  I have my doubts  I did a  Spot on  Hannity's radio show  Yesterday  I heard you  Very informed  And good  A little debate  With some woman  And boy  Was she a dummy  She fucking 
[00:25:00]  Starts talking about  Shoulder  Shoulder mounted  Rocket launchers  And would I  Like those to be legal  No  No  Then where's the line  She goes  Then what's the difference  Between an AR-15  And a shoulder mounted  Rocket launcher  And I said  If you don't know  The difference  How are you on  This show  Debating gun control  What are you talking about  But tell me  You wouldn't like  To go to the range  With a shoulder  Launching  Rocket  Shoulder  Whatever  Or the airport 
[00:25:30]  Would that  Would that be  A hoot  Down at the range  I would love it  And nobody's  Really addressing  Like they're saying  Oh mental health checks  And everything  But nobody's really  Addressing over medication  Or  Right  Anything like that  I mean that's a huge  Problem  Everybody's on pills  This is part of the bill  In New York  Is this mental health thing  It's very vague  It's almost as vague  As E-Rock's movie  What  Almost  It's very vague  I don't want to tell you 
[00:26:00]  I don't want anybody  To copy the bill  The bill  Can we read it  No I haven't  I'm not finished  I'm going to mail  The bill to myself  E-Rock  E-Rock comment  Yeah so  There's a mental health  Provision in this  New bill  Where  I guess if  A shrink  Some kind of  Mental health professional  Sees somebody  Acting a little kooky  In a way that they  See that  Perhaps there'll be 
[00:26:30]  A harm to themselves  Or others  Where a gun  Is related  And whether  He's talking about it  Whether he had brought it up  In the past  That he had a gun  And then the shrink  Realizes  Wow he's kind of kooky  He then  Has to report it  Whereas  The  Powers that be  Will take  The person's  Guns away  Now that seems  Vague  I mean I like  On the outside  It sounds good  You're kooky  You shouldn't have a gun  Take the gun 
[00:27:00]  But what again  Is the criteria  For these nuts  And  Can somebody  If  If somebody wants  Somebody's guns  Taken away  For some other reason  It's easy to now  Just say  They're a little kooky  Hey this guy  Said something  Look  Perhaps my rants  Here on this very program  When I go off  And I'm yelling  And screaming  I'm threatening  I'm doing  It's part of what  I do here on the show  Can you take  What I said  Now this sounds crazy  But is this  Out of the realm  Of possibility  Take what I say  On the air  Consider it 
[00:27:30]  Threatening  Yeah  And say  This guy has guns  We gotta go in  And take his guns  Because of what he's saying  Now I've had my first amendment  Dented  Because of what I said  On this show  Can my second right  Amendment rights  Be dented  Because of what I say  On this program now  But those questions  Are being  Good questions  Exactly  Just because they're  Good questions  Doesn't mean that  That they shouldn't  Try to do something  Like  I'm not saying  They shouldn't  You're right  Even though  I don't want to see  That happen either  And you gotta watch it 
[00:28:00]  With what you  Demand psychiatrists  Telling the government  Right  Like if you  They have to confess a crime  Like if you tell  Like in The Sopranos  He couldn't discuss  You can't say to your therapist  I'm a rapist  I'm a murderer  Because they have to tell you  You can't  Yeah  I mean I can joke about it  You know I can go  I'm a rapist  And she pretends  She doesn't know what I mean  Oh that's funny  Yeah  But now what  If she knows you  Or he knows you have guns  Yeah  And you say you feel violent  They have to tell  I don't understand that either  I don't either 
[00:28:30]  It's very vague  Under the legislation  Mental health professionals  Will be required to report  To local mental health officials  When there is reason to believe  A patient is likely  To engage in conduct  That will cause serious harm  To themselves or others  This information  Will then be cross-checked  Against the new  Comprehensive and regularly updated  Gun registration database  If the patient possesses a gun  The license will be suspended  And law enforcement  Will be authorized  To remove the person's firearms  This sounds  Very scary 
[00:29:00]  Not in an Alex Jones scary way  Not in a Jesse Ventura scary way  In a legitimate  Think this out  Read all the legislation  Kind of way  I'm not very comfortable with this  Yeah like if you're talking  To your shrink  And you're just like  Oh I wish I was dead sometimes  Yeah yeah yeah  I'd like to fuck  I would like to fucking  Blow his head off  Then  You don't mean it  You never would mean it  It's  Yeah  Sometimes you just say things 
[00:29:30]  Like to take those little  Bald genitals in my mouth  Oh Jesus  That  Uncle Paul  Where's the fucking phone  I gotta call a mental health professional  I gotta cross-check you  With the registry  Or you're talking about  What's set on the air  And who kid comes in here  And goes  Yo Anthony  Where can I buy a gun  I wanna shoot my wife  Exactly  Now  Would that  Would that be  A situation 
[00:30:00]  Where somebody would say  Ah  We better cross-check him  With a  Database  Of registered gun owners  And if he did have a gun  Take it away  I don't know  And  Am I going far with this  Further than the actual word of the law  Or even the  The concept of the law  I don't know  I don't know  But  But  Because it's there  There's a next step  There's always a next step  To these laws  If there's more of these shootings  Which  Mark my words  And this isn't a threat  By me  Believe me  I'm just saying 
[00:30:30]  Based on  What happens in the past  There will be other tragedies  That happen  And there will be  Mass tragedies  They will be done with rifles  They will be done with  High capacity magazine  So when they realize  That this isn't working  This doesn't work  They will then  Try to do something else  There will be more outcry  To do more  We did something  But we have to do more  Our work is not done yet  We must do more  And more means  More legislation  Against people  That are paying attention  To the laws  And 
[00:31:00]  Perhaps  This more obscure  Mental health  We gotta find  These weirdos  Kind of  Legislation  It's  It's a little scary  It delves into an area  That is a lot  Further reaching  Than just basic  Gun control  This is an issue  That goes further  Than just  A hardware  Gun control  Issue  And it's a little  Scary  Just a tad scary  Alright  I guess I did 
[00:31:30]  My fucking preaching  Again for the day  Not as  Not as robust  As yesterday  But  That's good  Because I  I felt a little sweaty  After yesterday  And I'm wearing  My  Vice City  Rockstar Games  GTA  Oh  Vice City  I thought that said  Vanity  No  And I didn't know this  When I put it on  This morning  It is laundry day  For me  And I'm starting  To get into  Those lower  Shirts in the drawer  And I put on  My Vice City  GTA shirt  And I came in 
[00:32:00]  And young Sam Roberts  Who knows all the  Hip things the kids  Are doing  Said  Anthony  Hey you're wearing  Your shirt  The shirt that  Changes color  I was like  Yeah what  And apparently  It's treated with  Something  That changes  White  When warm air  Hits it  Oh good  I hope it's the  Same chemical  They shoot in  When they're  Trying to dig  For natural gas  Some fracking  Chemicals  I got fracking  Chemicals  And now  If I'm sweating  Or hot under  The armpits  You didn't know 
[00:32:30]  The shirt changed  Colors  No  It's like  You know  Late 80s  Early 90s  Those things  Were huge  That's hilarious  Oh and there's  Like in the  Wrinkle in your  Shirt there  Yeah  Like towards the  Bottom  Oh man  There's a white  Mark on it  Oh god  I get hot  Under the collar  Cause you  You blew air  Onto it before  Yeah  Yeah look  And it just  Turns like  Fuck  It looks like  A jizz stain  All over  Yeah  Like I got  Jizz stains  On my shirt  The rest of the day  You'll have to tell  Someone  No no  People were  Blowing on my back  That's what all that is 
[00:33:00]  That's all it is  You could only wear  Those shirts a few times  Though cause  Those were big  When I was in  Like third grade  But you could always  Tell the poor kids  Because after you  Wash them  Like four or five times  The effect starts  To wear off  And you just get  Blotches on them  Oh okay  And the poor kids  Would keep wearing them  Oh it just looks like  They got stained shirts  Yeah  Oh that's good  You just see an exact  Replica of Uncle Paul's  Belly on the back  The kid's shirt  His big bologna nipples  And fucking  I hate those shirts  They're tattletale shirts 
[00:33:30]  Yeah tattletale clothing  They ought to call that  Mr. Hargis  It looks like  There's a little  A little circular thing  Looks like a chin print  Right up there  Under his neck  What is that  I don't know  I was helping him  Get something off the shelf  Oh that's it  I keep the candy  On the top shelf  Why you do that  Yeah you hoist them up  Oh is that  Do you check  Do you check  If they made it  In their pants  While you're hoisting them up  You gotta give 
[00:34:00]  The old sniff check  Get some candy  That's one of those  Parent things  That are fucking disgusting  And they do it  Without batting  The fucking eye  No  I've seen it  In restaurants  Where I'm fucking eating  And they lift their kid up  And they shove their nose  In the kid's ass  And go  Oh yeah yeah  I'm eating  It's fucking  It's  It's disgusting  It might not be  For the parent  I understand  But Jesus  Shove your hand down there  And if you come out  With some melted Hershey's  Go to the bathroom  I don't want to see 
[00:34:30]  You'll smell in a kid's asshole  You'd rather them  Yeah  Get shit all over their hands  Get a handful of shit  At least I don't have to  Like a former intern  Yeah  Yeah it is disgusting though  Isn't it  I don't know  I don't like it  I don't like kids in general  In restaurants  I think parents should just  Stay home with their kids  For like  The first  What  15 years  Something like that  I was running around  Making noise  You can't just ignore them  Making ha ha noises  Yeah I can't ignore them 
[00:35:00]  Because they're not ignorable  They're running around everywhere  Ruining your fucking experience  If I go out to a restaurant  I want to have a nice  Civil  Evening  Eat dining  And having some conversation  Oh the kid's having a good time  I'll just focus on  What's going on with me  Go to Chuck E. Cheese  You little fucker  I won't go there to eat  It's fucking  It's annoying  It really is  And some people  Have no idea  What to do  Like they let their kids  Run around  Yeah  Instead 
[00:35:30]  Like gather your little fucker up  Meanwhile they're doing it  Because they want to have  A nice night together  Without the fucking kid  Sitting at the table  That's what I came here for  I don't have any  God damn kids  They should have  Adults only  States  Yes  Child control  Actually it's the  Preservation of Adult Pleasure Act  Yes  Yes  I call it the  Anti-Kid Act  Yes  Little rotten creeps  They really are just  Rambunctious little things  Aren't they  Although I will say 
[00:36:00]  I was holding my nephew  He was very cute  Aw  Yeah I was kissing  They are adorable  It was fun  You get a little baby  Aw he's very cute  Something like that  He was very drooly though  Yeah  Very drooly  They tend to do that  He was a very drooly boy  What is that  The fucking kid  It's just like  Fucking looks like alien  They don't know how to do this  There's just shit pouring out of their fucking mouths  They don't know how you suck down spit  They don't know how to suck down spit  And it doesn't seem to bother them  That spit and snot are all over their face  They're figuring shit out 
[00:36:30]  They're like  Oh  Look at his nose  How about you work that out first  And then work on fucking crossing your hands over  They were just  They were just drinking blood  And they fell out of a pussy  Fucking  Sounds like my weakest  I don't know  The kids are stupid  Drooling shit  And pissing themselves  Well they don't have a lot of life experience  To draw from  Nah  Well I guess you're right  When did they learn to stop fucking  To suck their spit back in their mouth  When does that happen 
[00:37:00]  I'd say within the first year  No  I think after that  There's always a kid in school  That had the crusty boogery nose  And kids tease him  And then he starts taking care of it  Well the parents should teach you  How to blow your nose  So you're not embarrassed in school  You know what's worse in school  Like I know the exact thing  You're talking about  That white yellow crusty  Around a kid's nose  The black kids had that worse man  Oh the poor black kids  Because it shows up worse  Because the contrast  The black kid had a cold in school  And he'd have the  Like just crusty snot  All around his face 
[00:37:30]  Jesus  Wipe your fucking nose  White and the Asian kids  Are skipping through life  No one notices  But the black kid  It stands up  Oh the poor black kid  It's a nice hat  That Chuck Norris is wearing  Yeah it's a Danil Boone hat  Davey Crock  I never knew Davey Crock  It was so fat  Yeah that  It doesn't even match  Any other hair on his face  Or like the sideburns  No  His hair actually matches  The window treatments  Yeah why did he go with red 
[00:38:00]  Like there's not a hint of gray  There's like darker roots on it  I wonder  Do you think he's like  Completely totally bald  Like skinhead  He's like Dr. Phil  Dr. Phil horseshoe  Fucking  Bald  God what makes people  Get the fucking rug though  It does make you look younger  I hate to say it  But when you look at him  Yeah if he just had  He should get a better one though  He's Chuck fucking Norris  Yeah  He's got a hair system  He looks younger 
[00:38:30]  But it's also obvious  That he's wearing a toupee  Yeah  Yeah  It's like people know  Like you're like  Yeah he looks young  But  But  Obviously  Look at that fucking rug  He does not look 72  He's 72 years old  He probably still works out  What is that picture  That doesn't look as much  Like the wig  That's him  In 2011  Let me see  It's kind of  It doesn't look as much  Like a wig  Well  Maybe he got a 
[00:39:00]  Maybe  Because I know that commercial  Is pretty old now  Maybe he got a better  Hair system  The saddest thing  Is when you see guys  Like when they're  Combing it  The comb  But I mean the comb  Forward  Where they have  The hairspray  Onto their head  And it just looks  Like they've been  Yes  It's like  Did you just  Fucking haul  Cinder blocks  Yeah  Because your head  Is all matted  With fucking  A sheen  Yes  Which is their  Hairspray  Like the guy  In fucking  Raiders of the Lost Ark  The Nazi guy  He had that  It was pasted 
[00:39:30]  Over his head  The comb over  Yeah  Oh man  Yeah  I bet the first guy  That did the comb over  Though  I bet he got kudos  Like back when  I don't even know  When it was  Probably  After they pulled off  Those fucking wigs  Those powdery wigs  Yeah  That's probably like  Oh the wig thing is out  You know how many people  Were probably bummed  That the wig thing was out  How many guys wore the wig  After the wig  Wasn't fashionable anymore  Like dude  Wearing the fucking  The powder wig thing  That was so 1700s  You're not a judge  Yeah what are you doing  Oh no I like it 
[00:40:00]  Fuck you  I'm wearing it  1825  Yeah and he's still  Wearing the powder wig  And everybody's like  I'm a fucking loser  I'm a fucking wig  Young kids  All making fun of him  Yeah like the guy's  Got the powdery wig  And then he pulls it off  And he's fucking you know  And then he decides  What if I comb my hair  All over  Because my hair grows pretty long  And I just swoop it  Over the top  And then he's walking  Down you know  Down the fucking street  Going to the saloon maybe  And people are like  Hey look at that  Fucking  Looks great  Mr. Fucking 
[00:40:30]  Jeff Johnson  He combed his hair  Over his head  And it looks great  Hey there's something  Different about ye  Are ye working out  Ye look good  Yeah  Poor bastards  That's a good question  How long did they  Who  Who  Who was the holdout  For that fucking  Powdered wig  Powdered wig thing  Last guy keeping  The powdered wig store  In business  Yeah  Everyone's just laughing  At him  It's like  It's like the hipster hat 
[00:41:00]  Those dumb fucking hats  You just see them  Walking down the street  And go  When it's warm out  And they have a winter hat on  With little balls  On the sides  Yeah  Oh  Oh  Ear flaps  You don't like them  No they're horrible  Even in the winter  I don't like them  You know what  During the 90s  When people wore those  Furry Russian hats  Those big fucking  Russian hats  Ooh  Oh man  Look at the wig thing  They went all out  That's like fucking  Howard Stern  1994 hair  That these fucking guys 
[00:41:30]  Have had  Back in the old days  Very homoerotic  Powdered wig  Yeah  Yeah  And they powder  Their faces up  And wear like  A lot of rouge  On their cheeks  And put like  Like  Fake moles  On their face  What the fuck  Look is that  Marie Antoinette  Yeah  Very gender bending  But the guys that do it too  Yeah  They were very fucking  Moe-ish back then  A lot of moes  Moes through history  But then you get like  In the 80s even  The 1980s rock  Got weird with that 
[00:42:00]  You know  There's like  All these things that go  Fashions that kind of  Come and go  That are very feminine  That thing really  The fucking 80s  With the hair bands  And shit  Toward the end of it  It got insane  Where I mean  Bands you never heard of  You saw them on MTV  And we're like  What the fuck  Their hair teased up  So high  Total chick makeup on  Very slendering  Stretchy pants  Why the  And I'm watching  This is 
[00:42:30]  This is rock  This is like  You're supposed to go  Yeah  That's cool  See I didn't even notice it  I didn't even notice it  Really  No  I started noticing when  The second you started  Seeing grunge slip in  You started going like  Oh okay  Yeah these are guys  They're just wearing jeans  And their flannel shirt  They look dirty and shit  Now these guys look  Really faggy now  That's all it took  It took one guy  To stop wearing the wig  And makeup  And people were like  Oh  Oh  You look masculine 
[00:43:00]  Yeah  See now I see  I didn't know the term  Big wig came from  People who wore long wigs  Because they were so expensive  Oh here comes a big wig  Yeah  A big wig  That was a sign of  The cost of wigs increased  An average one cost  25 shillings  Which was a week's pay  For a commoner  And then a bill  For a large elaborate wig  Was as high as  800 shillings  I almost said that  When Kareem came in  He wasn't wearing a wig Anthony 
[00:43:30]  Yeah it was close to that  Oh  So 800 shillings  Shillings  Is how many  Wait  25 is a week's pay  25 was a week's pay  For a commoner  So 100 is a month's pay  That's 8 months pay  For a big wig  Rich people were wearing  8 months worth of  Poor people money  On their heads  And now Ant's tweeting out  8 months pay  From the casino  That's it  I could have had  I would have had 
[00:44:00]  Like many big wigs  Of course  And poor Sam  Would have just been  Like bald  With a few  Things of hair  On his head  And going like  I don't have a wig  Trying to grow my hair out  And just pulling it up  And  Oh yeah  Powdering my own hair  Poor Sam  Wouldn't be able  To afford a wig  How hot were those  Fucking things  They must have  Stunk back then  They had a lot of  Like oils  And like perfumes  That they would  Douse themselves with  Because bathing  People didn't take  Baths a lot  Back then  They all wore velvet  Like coats and pants 
[00:44:30]  Yeah it looks very heavy  Ruffled shirts  A lot of ruffles  A lot of fabric  Yes a lot of fabric  Draped over them  That's apparently  Another reason people  Wore wigs  Because lice was everywhere  And it was easier  To delouse a wig  Than a head of hair  I want to be ensconced  But then people  Stop wearing them  When a tax  Was levied on hair powder  What  It's amazing  How taxes  Fuck everything up  Taxes are the things  On hair powder  Yeah  Brit stopped wearing wigs  After William Pitt 
[00:45:00]  Levied a tax on hair powder  In 1795  What year  1795  So what was the  What was the powder for  To make them smell better  Probably  Maybe yeah  I bet they powdered the wigs  So the hair  We can get all tangled  I bet the powder  Kept the strands of hair apart  It's a big wig break  Maybe that's what  Obama's doing with guns  He's looking at the old  Wig legislation  He goes  No no no  We didn't ban wigs  We banned the powder  Wig powder  If we start banning magazines 
[00:45:30]  Yes  Yes  Then  The wig  The clean wig preservation  Legislation  Powder isn't good for the wigs  We're pro natural hair  Yes  Pro natural hair  And some presidents said  People weren't getting  Their fair share of wigs  Yes  Because all the wig hair  Was going to the big wigs  The wealthy  We're anti  We're anti-lice infestation  Yes  Not anti-hair  Not anti-hair  1790s  Yeah  That's when they stopped 
[00:46:00]  Wow  Throw them wigs away  Motherfucker  The 1800s are coming  How about here  I don't know  Party like it's  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  The judges  They're ripping off  Their wigs  Yeah  Fuck these  Partying  The judges  Still wear them  In England  Or no  I think the  Barristers wear them  Over there  Don't they  Do they wear them  In like parliament  For like  Oh  That's what I'm looking for  For bullshit  Pomp and circumstance  Do they look like douches

[00:48:00]  The thing that's on a sphinx  It looks like chain mail  But your grandmother made it out of wool  Out of wool  When you wanted to play King Arthur  Yeah  Go on  Put this over your shoulders  No one will stab you  Go on the others  Oh do they look dumb  Look at the black girl  That has one  There's a black judge  That has one  Oh that's silly  It doesn't look bad  It's just  Because black people  Look better in hats  It's just  That's my weave  Motherfucker  I got my English weave  Oh motherfucker  Oh that looks silly  That looks stupid  It does  But not as bad as the guys  Look at her 
[00:48:30]  It's a teeny  She looks like Harriet Tubman  Oh man  Yeah there's the little one  That just sits on the top of your head  And then there's the ones  With the pound puppy dog ears  Look he has to wear shoes  With buckles on them  Wow they are weird over there  And there's a guy  There's a lady following him  Holding his big robes up  What a butt  They really are  Let me tell you something  To England  You know what  How about you fucking stop  With the long fucking  Stupid dressy colors 
[00:49:00]  They're steeped in tradition Jimmy  And how about you stop  With the queen  And all that shit  Yeah  How about you stop  With the queen  But I enjoy us working together  Yeah that is silly  A lot of tradition  Does nothing for the  Stereotypes of sexuality  In England  No  Gay men  As Archie Bunker said  England's a fag country  Right  England's a fag country  He said  But it would appear that way 
[00:49:30]  Based on their  You know  It would  My mother would always say  Don't come over there  Because after they have tea and crumpets  They're going to tug your pud  Chipper  Hug your pud  Is that what mom said  Yeah  Oh here it is  Do you want to crank the volume up on this  I can't get enough of Archie  Roger  Roger the fairy  Roger the fairy  Roger the fairy  Roger the fairy  Roger the fairy  Did you hear that  Did you hear that  Do you know who they're bringing around here for lunch  Roger  Sweetie  Pye Roger  Cut it out  He was their friend  Listen eaters 
[00:50:00]  We run a decent home here  And we don't need any  Any strange little birdies  Flying in and out  Dad  Let me stop there  Roger's not a strange little birdie  His pal Roger  Is as queer as a four dollar bill  And he knows it  That's not only cruel daddy  That's an outright lie  You know something Archie  Just because a guy is sensitive  And he's an intellectual  And he wears glasses  You make him out of queer  I never said a guy who wears glasses is a queer  A guy who wears glasses is a four eyes 
[00:50:30]  A guy who is a fag is a queer  Well go ahead ye  I'll answer the question  Now you've seen Roger sashaying around here with his loudy dog talk  He's a fan  I don't know  What do you mean you don't know  I'm not an expert on flowers  He's a pansy  You might as well face it  You're all alone in this  We all know Roger  And we all know he's straight 
[00:51:00]  And even if he wasn't  And I said if  What difference would that make  Do you know that in many countries  England for instance  There is a law that says  Whatever two consenting adults do in private  Is their own business  Listen, this ain't England  We threw England out of here a long time ago  We don't want no more part of England  And for your information  England is a fag country  What?  Say  Are they still picking handkerchiefs out of their sleeve, huh?  Are they still standing around 
[00:51:30]  Leading on them skinny umbrellas like this here?  I know  Your whole society is based on a kind of a fagdom  A fagdom?  Holy shit  You know you're right, Archie  You're right  The British are a bunch of pansies  Pansies, fairies, and sissies  And the Japanese are a race of midgets  The Irish are boozers  The Mexicans are bandits  And you Polacks are meatheads  Holy fucking shit  That's why 
[00:52:00]  No wonder people enjoyed television  Right, they sat in front of TV and watched that shit every week  That's what you saw on CBS  That was CBS  Unbelievable  You forget how cutting edge and funny that shit was, man  Could you even fathom  Not one fuckable person in that scene  No  Except Gloria  Yeah, yeah  But I mean, Mike was a mopey  Archie was ugly  Edith was old  Right  Now it's politically correct 
[00:52:30]  Very attractive people  On every show  Could you even fathom  One of those lines being said  On any medium these days  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  That's the only thing that they would say  What's wrong with that?  Anything you want to criticize?  There also weren't 24-hour news networks  That had to be outraged by something  Outraged  We have to be outraged  Or no one's going to watch  All in the family  Homophobic  We'll tell you  Unbelievable 
[00:53:00]  What I heard last night  On all in the family  They were saying England was a kind of an F-dom  They used the F-word  The Q-word  The P-word  And that's the way it was  You can't do that shit  And does that  Did it make things better?  I don't know  Is that  Taking that shit  Away from people  Did it make things better for gays  Or was it just a  An evolution of gays  Fighting for their rights  And  Was it 
[00:53:30]  Was that a reflection of  The intolerance to gays  Or  Was that causing  A problem with gays?  I don't  I mean  No I was going to say  On that show  Archie's not  Portrayed as the guy  Who's a smart guy  Like he's not  That's not  His opinion is not portrayed  As the right  Thing to do  Exactly  It's like listen to this  Outrageous guy  He's an old man  But that's context  Context has no place  In anything today  Right  The second someone  Says something 
[00:54:00]  It's just  Said in a way  Like when they say  The n-word  On the news  In that context  You should just be able  To say the word  It's probably better  To have shows like that  On for gay people  Because  That opinion  Is being showed  On this grand scale  As being ridiculous  The ignorant opinion  Right  I told you  After Tracy got in trouble  Tracy Morgan had to apologize  I interviewed gay comics  Because I wanted to know  Like as comedians  You guys  Where do you  I told you  And I think I told a story  Jim David and Rick Crone  Were both funny acts 
[00:54:30]  Look he's just outing people  They came on the radio  Oh okay  They came on the radio  That's exactly  It was a really  It was a fun show  We didn't get much accomplished  But Jim raised a really  Interesting point  Which I had  I mean I'm never  For censoring speech  But he said  He didn't care  That Tracy had to apologize  Even as a comic  And he said  That his point of view was  He goes yeah  But it's not  Because it's not  A level playing field  Like because  He said  We're not treated equally  I don't care if people  Get in trouble for slamming  Like  And I kind of understood that  Like if it was a level  Playing field 
[00:55:00]  Then the whole  Say what you want thing  Would be in play  Because  But he goes  Since that  He goes  Since basically  They're not treated  As equal citizens  He doesn't care  If there's language  And I kind of understood that  Even though  I never want to see  Anyone in trouble  For language  Yeah yeah  I don't know  I guess  Yeah it's very hard  To be able to  Put yourself in that  Position  Put yourself in that position  Unless you're  You're there  You know  A lot of people  Criticize my  My views on black crime  And stuff  And say well  You don't even understand  What they have to go through 
[00:55:30]  On a daily basis  And this  But  And I can agree with that  Obviously  But  I don't think it gives you  An excuse  And I don't think  Anybody should get in trouble  For  Voicing their  Opinions on anything  Race  Sexuality  Shit like that  Although it should be  For all white people  Who love being just  White males  Great  The language problems  That you're having right now  Really are a sign  That things are good  For me too  Yeah  Because as a white guy  If I'm seen  By society  As 
[00:56:00]  The most privileged  Or the most  Was fortuitous the word  Fortuitous  That I am the one  Who's going to take  The most shit  As a white male  Right  And the one  It's again  It's the top of the food chain  Who gets  And I don't mean  In anyone's mind  Except for the way  Things work out  In the legal system  Yeah but boy  That's turning real quick  I think  Again  White males  They're allowed  To get shit on  Like there isn't  A recourse 
[00:56:30]  And then everybody says  Well you're a white guy  Fucking  It's easy for you  It's this  It's that  There's a bunch of excuses  As to why  We can be shit on  On a daily basis  But  You know  It does get infuriating  Sure  At times  Like I  I'm looked at  As the nation's piggy bank  I hate that  It's fucking  It's infuriating  And then  Even though  I'm foot in the tab  For a lot of shit  You know  I'm getting shit on  Again  My rights are being taken away  I'm not able to  Speak openly  About certain things 
[00:57:00]  Race, sexuality  Things like that  Without having to  Sidestep things  Believe me  When I go off  On here  Or on Twitter  I'm thinking about  What I'm saying  Sure  I'm trying not to be  Reckless  Because  And not out of the  Not out of  I have the want  To say certain things  But I also know  That my job would be at stake  My livelihood  As dumb Joe DeRosa says  Yeah  You want to  You want to take a break?  Yeah  I want to make a statement  If this fucking  E-channel is on again  When I come in 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to break that television  Why?  You didn't want to see  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck  Accepting an Oscar?  And the same thing  I watched that  Matt Damon movie last time  That's why I came up  With that dumb gas movie  Promised Land  Oh, how was it?  I like it  He's a good actor  Matt Damon  He's a really good actor  I like the Matt Damon  As an actor  Yeah  I heard that  He was catching a lot of shit though  Because of the  It's kind of a  Politically  One-sided movie  Like I think  A lot of that stuff  Is  Kind of an agenda 
[00:58:00]  Agenda-driven movie  Oh yeah, I'm sure it is  He's, you know  But it was  I felt it was more about  Big business  And how they treat  Poor people  I didn't think it was  As much about natural gas  I thought that was just  The issue they chose  Oh, okay  But I felt it was more  Like a big company  Kind of coming in  Sending in  The smooth-talking  Son of a bitch  And kind of  Running over poor people  And promising them things  And it didn't feel  That preachy  I mean, even though  You knew what the agenda was  Yeah  I liked it 
[00:58:30]  Hal Holbrook was very good  Well, he looks like  An old lady now  Oh, does he?  Hal Holbrook looks weird  Yeah  Yeah, I think he's had  A little work done  But his teeth look like  False  It's like  This is the guy  That was in the fog  And he just looks odd  I remember Hal Holbrook from  The Star Chamber  Yeah, he was in Star Chamber  He was in Creepshow  The one where  It's like  Just tell him to call you Billy  With Adrian Barbeau  Sure  And also  That is not Hal Holbrook  Oh my god  He does look like an old woman 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, I think he's wearing a wig  Holy shit  Holy shit  His cheeks look rosy  I think he's had a little bit of Botox  Again, it looks like it  And it looks like a wig  I am stunned  That doesn't even really look like him  No  Looks like Martha Washington  Yes  Holy shit  Wow  I also remember Hal Holbrook  In a movie  It was a very controversial  I think a TV movie  In the 70s  Child of the 80s  Where it was  Him  As a homosexual 
[00:59:30]  Whoa  Yes  Very  Very controversial  Is he gay?  I don't think so  Maybe he is  I don't know  Anything about his wife?  It was in the 70s  God, what the fuck?  I can't remember the name  Does anybody have the name on here?  Okay, I can give you some TV movies  Alright, give me some TV movies  About him in the 70s  When Hell was in Session  No  The Legend of the Golden Gun  No  Murder by Natural Causes

Waterhouse commercials  Him and OJ  And James Brolin  Was in it  And they went to Mars  And then they  They apparently  Faked the whole Mars thing  And then they told the people  That they died on re-entry  So they had to kill him  Because they couldn't have him go out  Yeah, yeah 
[01:00:30]  Oh shit  But then they escaped  And they were running to tell everybody  It was great  Capricorn 1  Um, no  No, no  Keep going  No, keep going  33 Hours in the Life of God  Keep going  Pueblo  No, no, no  That Certain Summer  Yes  That sounds like  That Certain Summer  What's that about?

Or was he like a  Oh, I think he was  Wait a minute  Was Martin Sheen the  Oh, no  Martin Sheen was Gary McLean  Gary McLean  Did Hal Holbrook clean up his wounds  After he blooded himself in the hotel in Saigon  And blow him?

He was in Wall Street too  Where you going?  Did he tell him he's gay?  What happened?

[01:04:00]  Better take out the takeout  I'll give you a hand  Oh, boy  I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch that  I'm gonna find that and watch that movie  Because I remember being so uncomfortable  Watching that as a kid  Because all I could  I know why you're uncomfortable  Why?  Because your dad was right next to you  And he was just staring at the tent  In the front of your pants  Calling you queer  My, my dad had already been out of the house  Like, divorced and stuff  Like, uh, my parents were divorced  So he would come by  I  Yeah, he would come by  Like, on the weekends  And stuff like that  But, uh, I remember watching that 
[01:04:30]  And being so uncomfortable  Because all I could relate to  Was my dad  So, when I'm watching this  And little Scott Jacoby  I was thinking like  Oh, my God  How would I feel?  And I got so  Into how that would be  If that was my dad  It made me so uncomfortable  Oh, I didn't like it  Well, he should have told him  That my friend's eating with us  You don't just let the kid  Run upstairs and find  Find your gay lover  You, with a fucking  A fruity turtleneck  And a  A kitchen towel  On his hand  He did  And what a spotless apartment 
[01:05:00]  Of course it was  Why wouldn't it be  A giant 70's house  Tastefully decorated  Yeah  I'll take out the takeout  That certain summer  God, I gotta find that  I hope it  Well, it's on, uh, what?  YouTube?

[01:05:30]  Yeah, there's always  The 70's movies  Always have weird bird chirpings  In the outdoor scenes  You can always tell  A 70's movie  It's so much wasted time  We need more bird chirpings  Yeah, they'll show the car  Coming around the corner  And pulling up  And stopping  And it's just like  What did you waste that time for?  Show the guy in the house  Yeah  Oh my god  At that certain summer  With Hal Holbrook  Uh, alright  Let's take a break  Let's eat something  Um, Opie will be in soon  And, uh, we'll have some fun  Flight landed like  45, 55 minutes ago 
[01:06:00]  He's probably lollygagging  Fucking travel agent?  That's right  He's probably  He's probably lollygagging  Around town  Oh, do we have an update  On Opie's flight, Kenny?  Yes, he's in a chauffeur-driven car  Uh, how's the weather?  It's very sleety  Sleety?  Yeah  And, uh, you're expecting  Tunnel traffic, Kenny?  Yes, normally on a weekday morning  There's tunnel traffic  You've done that drive  In various weather  Uh, what do you think  The ETA would be? 
[01:06:30]  I'd say by 7.30  Yeah  Let me check  15 minutes, that would be  Yeah  It lasts, uh, 6.41  Uh-huh  So I say, uh, half hour  Oh, right  Yeah, only 15 minutes  You're asked, uh, there, Jimmy  Well, what time do you land?  40 minutes ago  Oh, that's the time  The plane comes in  Ah, and then it's got a taxi  It arrived at the gate  Two minutes early  At 6.24  Wow, two minutes early 
[01:07:00]  It's amazing how they really  Even ever are on time  Or two minutes  When you think  You're going from  One side of the country  To another  In a giant flying machine  And you land  Two minutes  Within the time  They said you were going to land  Yeah  To me, that's astounding  But they know that  Three months in advance  Hey, February 73rd  I'm going to fucking  I'm going to Nantucket  Oh, you'll be there at 8.02  It's going to be windy  What?  I know 
[01:07:30]  It is astounding  And Louis C.K. does a great bit  About how we complain about things  And then, you know, you're flying  You're in the air  You're in a chair in the sky  A chair in the sky  It's a hilarious bit  But it is amazing  That you even get mad  When you're late  Like, an hour  An hour  You'd be furious  But it's going from one side  Of the country to the other  And they missed by an hour  Alright, relax  It's quite astounding  We have a guest today, too  What?  The former Bubba Ray Dudley 
[01:08:00]  Who is he now?  Now he's Bully Ray  Bully Ray?  Well  It's very topical  Guess who  Bullying  Bully Ray  Guess who owns Bubba Ray Dudley  Not the guy Bubba Ray works for anymore  Oh, no, wait  Oh, Vince Monsona  Yeah, well  He went from ECW to WWE  As Bubba Ray Dudley  And then he left WWE  And Vince said  You're not leaving with that name  Get over here  Bubba Ray Dudley is mine  You ain't taking it with you  Why don't you be Bully Ray Dudley? 
[01:08:30]  Alright, that's a good idea  No, because I own that now, too  No, not Bully Ray Dudley  Oh, I know, yeah  Because Vince owns Dudley  Yeah  Oh, he owns  Oh, no  He can't be Dudley anymore  He can't even be Dudley?  But he was Dudley before he went to WWE  Yep  Then how did he sign that away?  I think Vince McMahon bought all of ECW's intellectual properties  I own Dudley Do-Right  I own the little kid that was molested  Little Dudley  I own the bathtub 
[01:09:00]  Wow, he fucking can't even say Dudley  So it's Bully Ray?  Bully Ray is his  How did he get Ray?  Because it was Bubba Ray Dudley  How is he able to slip out Ray?  Bubba  You can call me Ray  You can call me  But you don't have to call me Johnson  Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley  Became  Became Brother Ray  And Brother D-Von  Wow  And then when they broke up  In TNA  Vince must laugh  His ass up 
[01:09:30]  He knows he's never going to use the names anymore  Of course not  He's not going to make another Bubba Ray Dudley  But he's just keeping other people from using it  It's locked on a vault  You'll never see it  Yeah, I think Paul Heyman sold off all of the properties that were created in ECW  Wow  To Vince  Oh  Jesus  See how they call themselves Dudley Dillerong or something, right?

[01:12:00]  When you eat on the air  It's fucking disgusting  Alright  Go fuck your mother  Yeah  I thought I told you  Go fuck your mother  Was that person blocked?  No  I wouldn't block for that  I don't block for things  Like that  They can be polite about it though  They can say  I wish you wouldn't eat on the air  Doesn't have to say  Fucking disgusting  I'd still tell him 
[01:12:30]  Go fuck his mother  Good  Yeah, I don't care  I don't sit here the whole show and eat  We need nourishment  Here on the radio show  Oh, Kenny's just bursting in  Somebody is out of the tunnel  So they should be here in a few minutes  Oh  That would be the  Lincoln Tunnel  Yes  I gotta see Lincoln still  I think I might watch it  Later  Tonight  Where's it playing? 
[01:13:00]  It's playing  Some place out on Long Island  One of the cinemas  Out there  Oh  It's a wonderful theater  I love it  The client exceeds  Home is not too crowded  And of course that button  Oh, right  Oh, the button  You just press it  The film stops  I have a theater like that near me  Do you?  Yeah, yeah  Great, right?  Mm-hmm  Yeah, I love it  And then you go to the bathroom  You make yourself a drink  You come back  You push the button again  And the film  Starts up again  Podcasting studio next door 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah  Podcasting studio  Right next door  Of course  I'll have to  Shut all the doors  So people don't hear the  Boo!  Boo!  When it's over, you mean?  No  No  Not when it's over  But that last scene, probably  Nope  How does it end?  Does he get shot?  Oh, well  Spoiler, spoiler  The scene  It's like the big last  The climax  Yeah  Is of course  They, you know  Free the slaves or whatever 
[01:14:00]  Uh-huh  And then  And then they don't  Actually show the  Assassination?  The shooting?  They show him  They do it in a way  But they don't show him  They should show it  Yeah  They should show it  And then have his big hat  Go like  Like off his head  It just flies across the room  Spins and lands back on his head  He goes  What the?  And then it goes  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da  And the movie ends  Do you know how disappointing  That would be to people?  Especially if they didn't tell  Daniel Day-Lewis  Or they just did it in post  Well, you know 
[01:14:30]  Spielberg really took  An odd turn there  He'd be watching it  Going like  What the fuck  Did you do to my performance?  I thought it was  A little slow  Lincoln  Is it?  Yeah  I fell asleep  You fell asleep?  I don't fall asleep  That often in movies  But I fell asleep  And for you  I think this would be  Something that was  Close to your heart  Why is that?  Well, you're black  Oh  I have some movies  To bring in, by the way  If anybody wants them  Because I'm a member of  Of course  I don't have to  You know me  Just get involved on  Oh, you have some screeners?  Yes, I do  How come I'm a member 
[01:15:00]  Of SAG?  Why don't I get screeners?  Don't know  Why are you not  On the voting board  Of SAG?  Why can't I be  On the voting board?  My opinion really counts  I don't really know  Hey, I think I got  Something, though  Like a ballad  In the mail  A ballad?  Yeah, or something  Yeah, probably to vote  For what?  Best pick  The SAG awards  They send out  But I need screeners  Why don't they send me screeners?  I saw  Did they just send them to you?  Do you just open the mail  And go like  Every year I get them, yeah  What did you do to get them?  It's just, you know  It's my opinion counts 
[01:15:30]  Whatever, Jim  We don't have to think, Jim  Who's better?  Who's worse?  You know  Whatever  So I saw  Silver Linings Playbook  Oh, right  You were talking about that  Oh, did I talk about this  On the air?  No, no, no  You were talking about it  Off the air  That you saw it  Yuck  I told you  It was horrible, right?  It was just a dumb  Like, rom-com movie  I didn't think it was a rom-com  I mean, I thought it was a  The guy  The acting  The guy's acting was good 
[01:16:00]  De Niro was fine  The girl was good  But what a fucking  What a cornball story  Oh, really?  That fucking  The big dance-off  Oh, fuck you  What?  Like Grease?  Holy shit  Was I irritated  Here's what I hate  I hate in a movie  When a character  Like, two characters are together  And two other characters look  At the two characters together  It's almost like  I hate when somebody writes that in  Like, they both shoot a look 
[01:16:30]  Like they're doing  Our work as the audience  Like, oh, look at them  Or when they talk  Our work as the audience  Or that guy over there  He's a hero  When they  Whoever wrote that  Is talking about the hero  The way he wants himself  Talked about  Ew  I fucking hate it  Iraq, do you have a part like that  In your movie?  No, not at all  Oh, right  Of course not  The guy's hateable  How could he?  Another tidbit of information  That we just got on  Iraq's movie  That's right  But can you imagine, though  If mental illness was as pleasant  As that movie was 
[01:17:00]  How much easier things would be  And it's such nonsense  It's such nonsense  So, I guess  What's the gist of the story here?  Because I don't give a shit  I'm not even gonna  Fucking see that piece of shit  Guy comes home from a nuthouse  Hey!  And he's  He's De Niro's son  Yeah  De Niro's son  And flashbacks  Kind of realize  He's in the nuthouse  Because he came home  And he heard his wedding song playing  And he saw his wife in the shower  And she was getting her pussy  By a balding history teacher 
[01:17:30]  That she worked with  Whoa!  And that sent her to the nuthouse?  Well, he beat the guy  Almost to death  Because the guy  Unbelievably said  I think you should leave  Which just  So, how about  They fucking pat him on the back  And his pals  Take him out for a beer  How would that send you  To the nuthouse?  Exactly  Here's what they had to do  They had to find  In the story  A way to get him  Into the crazy house  That still made him  Redeemable  And likable  Right  And the whole movie  He's pining  For this cunt  Who is cheating on him  Who has to see  That he's changed  And gotten 
[01:18:00]  They don't show her  Until at the end of the movie  Right  And you have to see  That he's gotten better  But the reality is  I understand why  He beat the guy  Almost to death  He was eating the guy  He was eating your wife's pussy  Yeah  And he said something shitty to you  That's not a  Wow, you have to be crazy  To do that  That's a  You would do that  But the guy's also bipolar  Yes  And he was completely unlikable  I hated him  He was a selfish twat  Waking his parents up  At three in the morning  Just to talk  And the acting  The guy did a good job  Acting it  But I was like  I hated the character 
[01:18:30]  Yeah  You selfish jerk off  You were right to beat the guy up  For eating your wife's cunt  In your own house  With the wedding song playing  But was it a good  To hate the character  Because he was doing a good job  No  And stuff  Because you would hate  A character like that  That's selfish  Yeah but I mean  As a movie watcher  I couldn't root for him  I wanted him to get leukemia  The entire film  Oh  Oh okay  And De Niro played  A totally unbelievable  OCD father  Who only cared about  Betting on the Eagles  And I didn't believe  Any of these relationships 
[01:19:00]  No  I did not fucking believe them  And it wasn't like  It was this OCD betting thing  But again  Like Jim said  He had to still be likable  So it's not like  He was gambling away  The family's house  Or something  Oh okay  So they should have  Taken it  His life wasn't ruined  Oh then he's just  Fucking gambling  He's just a guy  Who likes to gamble  On the weekend  Well then the big bet  Sam  Is for a lot of money  Which would enable the father  To open the restaurant  He wants  I bet he  Yeah but you  Loses  But there's a little twist  There's a parlay  Because the bet  Is not only on the football game 
[01:19:30]  It's on the big dance off  At the end  And what score  The dance  It fucking  Ew what do you mean  Stunk  How do you bet on a dance off  Well  Because Bradley Cooper's character  The bipolar guy  Kind of starts to fall in love  With Jennifer Lawrence  Who's also bipolar  Which I had no idea  How beautiful bipolar people were  Yeah  But um  Yeah where's that white shit  In the corner of your mouth  And your sour milk breath  Fucking  You're right  Exactly  Good point  Yeah  Bradley Cooper  And Jennifer Lawrence  If everybody was not  I would love crazy people  If they all look like that  Exactly 
[01:20:00]  Just eat her crazy asshole  While she's coughing  Into a pillow  And she looked amazing  In the movie  Of course she did  But you know  But so yeah  So they're training  For a dance competition  That she wants to do  And then  They don't think  They're going to be  Good dancers  So the guy  Who's betting with the dad  They make a bet  That I bet  They won't score  Higher than a five  At the dance off  Oh yeah  Well I'll bet  If the point spread  Is blah blah blah  And the dance off  Score is  Bullshit  Dance off 
[01:20:30]  And then they  The movie's nominated  In every category  Oh my god  At the awards  Every one  Every major category  Got a nomination  It sounds terrible  It's not good  It sounds awful  But they only nominated it  Because mental illness  Is the new retard  Oh  And so this is like  It's not a feel good movie  Right  Not your overt retardation  Well they figured out a way  Your subtle mental illness  They figured out a way  To get people's  50 most beautiful people  Uh huh  Into these retard roles 
[01:21:00]  Without actually  Having to be retards  Without having to  Distort their faces  Or  Funny  Exactly  So they're  You're still playing  The retard angle  But it's the beautiful people  And you can make it sexy  Right  It's also the shallow  And well her big thing  Is she was such a slut  Right  She fucked so many people  And the thing is this  It's also like shallow hell  This is how fucking  Vomit inducing Hollywood is  The only way to give a message  About fat people  Was to have Gwyneth Paltrow  Be in that movie  And give that message 
[01:21:30]  So the way to give message  About bipolar  Is to have two people  That the audience  Can fall in love with  Physically  Give the message  But the mistake they made  Was they made the characters  Unbelievable  And hateable  Yeah  Like a lot of bipolar  People are  Right  But they should have  Made them at least  You should have felt  Some empathy for them  If that's the angle  They were going for  There's plenty of ways  To have written that  And at no point  Was it like  Oh my god  Their lives are falling apart  It was  Oh yeah  Chick likes to dance  Like you know what I mean 
[01:22:00]  Right  There's the Hollywood version  Of that  And then there would be  Another movie  That would portray it  More realistically  And be Oscar worthy  Yes  You know like  Like a realistic  Depiction of  Crazy people  Just watching  Lives crumble  Yeah  And relationships get destroyed  Well act and stuff  Not the  The who's it  In Hollywood people  Playing  Yeah  Hunger Games  And The Hangover  Are now bipolar  Charming  But charming 
[01:22:30]  An academy award winning  Performance  It's like no  Because this is  Hollywood fluff  It is  It should be people  You don't even know  Who they are  Like Jimmy said  The white crust  On the side of their mouth  They're fucking  Literally crazy  Philip Seymour Hoffman  Would play it probably  A very good  Right there you go  In Love Liza  Did you ever see  Love Liza  No  Where he's  He's fucking  He's not bipolar  But the push of the movie  Is his  It's very sad  It's not a great movie  Like you missed something  His wife Liza  Commits suicide  And it's the beginning  Of the movie  You don't even see her  Yeah it's a really weird 
[01:23:00]  Romantic comedy  Him in a bottle  That's great  And she left him a note  And the whole movie  Is he cannot bring himself  To read the note  Oh wow  And it's really sad  I could love Liza  So he plays this depressed  Sad sack guy  Who's fucking  Huffing glue  And it's kind of  A meandering weird movie  He gets into like  Flying kites  There's some weird hobby  He got into  But that's a guy  Who played it well  By the way  I can tell that  Opie's walking in  Oh Sam  Do you know how happy I am 
[01:23:30]  To see Sam  Have to get pushed  Out of that seat  Sam get the fuck  Out of the seat  Beat it  Take a hike  Tell your story walking  Now I have a theory  By the way  Did you get my last  Relativity  Opie's been texting me  A very depressing  Yet understandable  Update to his  Did you say it on the air yet  No  Oh really  I did not  I said it off air  Well can I say this  Really fast  I don't know how the fuck  You do that red eye  And then come in here  And do radio  Did you sleep  I can never sleep on it  No  No  It was the 
[01:24:00]  The old plane  First class  Which is nice  An old plane  Wait what airline  United  We all do what you do  Jimmy  United Airlines  I don't even fly them  I fly American LA  Oh really  Because they have  The three classes of service  Did you have the sit up  Seats or the lie back  I had the lie back  On the way out  Which is just  Fuck it  It's the only way to go  Isn't it the only way  To fly  It's the only way to fly  Yes  And then on the way home  It was the basic  First class seat  Where you sleep  Every five minutes  Wake up  Yeah six seats 
[01:24:30]  It's six rows  The neck hurts  Yeah exactly  Everything fucking hurts  Oh good  Do you have an aisle  Or a window seat  Window  Okay  I like a good window  Can I say what happened  Yeah yeah  Fucking Joe Pesci was in my seat  I had to tell him to move  What  I swear to god  I see this old man  In my seat  And you know  I need my window  So I can at least  Put my head down  And I see this guy  And I'm like  Oh you're in my seat  I was kind of obnoxious  Because I was really tired  I've been up since yesterday morning  Hey go fuck yourself 
[01:25:00]  So then he gets up  And he goes  Well could you read my ticket  Because I don't have my glasses  Oh no  So I'm looking at his ticket  And he was across the road  But he had his window seat  Oh he did  Okay okay  And then I'm sitting there  All happy and nice  And I'm settling in  And then a guy goes to me  You're in my seat  Oh shit  And it turned out  And it was Ray Liotta  Yeah  You had to sleep in the trunk  Next to Frank Vincent  And it turns out  I was in the wrong seat too 
[01:25:30]  So it wasn't my seat  Or Pesci's seat  Jesus Christ  So you weren't sitting  Next to Pesci  No  God no  But the guy that was  He feels like  He's best friends with him now  He literally walked  Through the entire airport  With him  Like they were pals  Oh no  Was he annoying him  Not really  But it was kind of  That Obama situation  That I talk about  I think he was hoping  For the exchange  Of phone numbers  He's old man  Pesci  Yes  Pesci's old  Because I saw him  Walking onto the plane  And I didn't  I go I know that guy 
[01:26:00]  But I didn't  I didn't recognize him  Right away  Right  He's really short  Did everybody recognize him  No  Is that what he looks like  No  I bet you that picture  Is a couple years old  Wow he's even older  Huh  And then I kept  Looking back at him  Because he was  The seat  Two seats behind me  And at one point  I thought he was dead  How he was sleeping  He was sleeping in the air  Meaning like he was  Leaned all the way forward  And his head was in the air  As he's sleeping  Don't you need your head 
[01:26:30]  On something  I don't know if he takes anything  Some people take things  To fly too  Is that him  But he was dressed  Like a gentleman  No  He looks older than that  No  I hope you got a picture  With him  Oh you didn't say  Any of this  No  So then  I fucking hate  Being rejected  Oh no  It's the worst  Feeling ever  Oh no  You feel like a piece of shit  And I didn't use the radio show  He's been on the show  At least  Maybe twice  At this point  It's the bitches  That are gitches 
[01:27:00]  He was on for the  It's the bitches  That are gitches  So we're walking  I'm with Chris  Yes  And I'm doing a Jim Norton  This is how my fucking camera works  You know  I'm not like Jimmy  For every picture  But every once in a while  I go Jim Norton  And I waited all the way  To baggage claim  Even though we didn't  We didn't have bags  He was waiting for his  Oh wow  But I figured  It would be slow down there  I go  Yo Joe  Can I get a picture  He goes  Ah man  And then he had a guy  With him already  That met him on this side  And the guy's like  Ah you know 
[01:27:30]  If he starts that  Everyone will want a picture  Of one of those deals  And I'm looking around  Who's everyone  There's five of us  And then Joe  He puts his arm around me  He's like  Look man  I look half dead  I look half dead  I'm like alright  I don't want to bother you  Big fan  And then I had to walk away  That was about  My theory was wrong  I texted  I'll buy the theory  When you said  Pesci wanted you  To read his ticket  I thought he might have  Wanted your seat  And wanted you to see  Hey it's Joe Pesci  But he had an aisle already  If he had a window too 
[01:28:00]  Well if I was sitting  I would have gave him the window  If I got to sit next to Pesci  The whole fucking flight  Yeah  You could watch him sleep  I know  But I just made up for it  Because I ran into  Some big celebrities downstairs  Who'd you run into  Big fucking celebrities  They're probably the ones I got  On the elevator on the way up  I know  I know  Big celebrities  We saw them already  Who'd you get  If it's the elevator picture I got  Who'd you get  You got  Yeah  Yeah  I got him on the way up  That's just like having 
[01:28:30]  Joe Pesci  Yeah  The fucking  Revenge of the nerds guys  I got Booger  And who's the other guy  Robert Carradine  Robert Carradine  Right  Yeah  And Robert Carradine  Is still dressed like  A fucking nerd  He's got to dress like  A nerd character  They're doing  They're doing some press  Dude I was  You see my face  I'm like  This is supposed to be  Me and Pesci  Not two fucking nerds  Imagine getting turned down  By Booger though  I was coming in the  Fucking building this morning  At like fucking five to six  And I'm swiping  And they're standing there  And I'm annoyed  I'm like excuse me  Right  And then they get on the  Elevator with me 
[01:29:00]  I'm like what the fuck  And I'm looking at Booger  I'm like this guy looks familiar  So as we're getting off  Upstairs I'm like  Are you an actor  Yeah  And he goes yeah  I love your work  And then I didn't recognize  Carrie  And he goes I'm an actor too  He was kind of kidding  I'm like oh my god  I was screaming  Can I ask you something  Yeah  If you had to ask him  If he was an actor  How do you then say  I love your work  Because wouldn't you have  Known him if you loved his work  No not necessarily  Because if  Are you an actor  Sounds insincere  I thought I recognized you  And then I got a picture  Of both of them  And I had the security guard  Taking it  But his fucking finger  Was over the flash 
[01:29:30]  I wanted to bite his finger  Oh you dummy  Why didn't we get him  On the show  We didn't know they were here  He did Howard's show  Yeah  They did Howard's show  I guess they're promoting  Some nerd thing  That's on TV  I'll tell you the mistake  You might have made with Pesci  Doing it at baggage claim  Because that's where  People are going to be  Congregating  And he might have had to wait  There was no one around  You know that flight  Yeah  There's no one  There's no one in the airport  In general  Try to get him  While they're walking  Well I went to the  I did a Norton  I'm like  He's an old man  He's got that bladder  He's got to go to the bathroom  So the first bathroom  Yeah  I went in 
[01:30:00]  I'm like alright  I'm set up nice now  And then I'll wait for him  Outside the bathroom  But he bypassed the bathroom  And you say  You let them know real quick  You're like hey man  Can I get a quick picture  It's from my own wall  It's not going anywhere  Right  Like because they're afraid  Of Twitter  And TMZ  And all that shit  Posting a picture  And all of a sudden  Pesci's ancient  And then it's all over Twitter  Fuck man  But he was nice to you  He was great  He was actually really nice  But fuck man  I guess I'll get him next time  Right  You should have told him  You were Opie from the Opie  That'll happen  I was thinking that  You always tell him 
[01:30:30]  Hey man I interviewed you  A couple times  Right  For the song  This way they feel guilty  And fuck him if he doesn't want to do it  And he does it anyway  Then you got the picture  Fuck  So I've been turned on  I want that one  That's one  That's one I want  I want that  Yeah that would kill me too  I got nerds instead  What the fuck am I going to do  With a picture with nerds  It's like I don't even want to look  At my Pesci picture now  Because I feel bad  You do have one right  Yeah  Thanks to Kevin James  I thought you did  Fuck  So why did he take a picture with you  He was at an event 
[01:31:00]  Looking all nice and shit  No no no  He was getting  I told Anthony  I told this off the edge  A minute ago right  He was at the comedy cellar  And Kevin was around  And someone said  He's out there with Pesci  So this is years ago  I walk out  And I see fucking Pesci  Getting into a town car  When he saw me coming  With my camera  And so Kevin was outside  The town car  And so I was like  I said hey  How you doing  He's like oh what's up man  And I'm like dude  Can you introduce me to Pesci  And he goes yeah  So he goes in the car  And he goes  This is a friend of mine  Jim Norton  And then Pesci took a picture  He was cool right  He was really  Yeah  And he has to say  He wanted no part of me 
[01:31:30]  Oh really  But he was nice  You know  Joe was talking to everybody  Oh was he  Yeah  And he's wandering around  In first class  In the worst turbulence  I thought he was  Going to go flying  And the stewardess  Is trying to get him  To sit down  But how do you tell Joe Pesci  He was pretty much  Getting his own coffee  At one point  I think he was pouring  His own coffee  Flying the plane  Right  That flight is creepy  That overnight flight  Is weird man  Why is that?  You're just in the air  It's a weird vibe  Yeah you're in the middle  Of fucking darkness  And yeah  Knowing everyone below you 
[01:32:00]  Is sleeping  It's creepy  That is kind of weird  Yeah  Cause I mean  We've all flown in the dark  But you know  There's life down there  But not when you  Take off L.A. time  What it was  Probably 10 something  For the continental flight  15 or something  Yeah  Fuck  How was the taping?

[01:33:30]  A wow shirt  On the set  Yeah  Yeah  So  It's weird to watch  It's to watch something  They've edited  In front of an audience  Because you haven't seen  It's like  If there's a joke  That doesn't work  Or a moment  You can't prepare for it  You go alright  Here's where this doesn't  Cause you haven't seen it  I knew  I knew all the edits  I was hoping  They were gonna do  And they did man  They nailed it  Fucking nailed it  Cause I mean  The prank took  Four hours  And the piece is  Five minutes  So you talked to  Russell and Paul  Oh fuck yeah  Yeah Russell one  Dragged me around LA  As he's doing spots

[01:37:30]  I'm not gonna oversell it  It was a bit  It was a wimpy baby hit  Yeah  That's good  It's a gesture  Well then I was thinking  You know this  Then I'm thinking  Yeah I do want to do this  But then I'm thinking  I'm gonna fuck up the podcast  Oh you think you would  It would probably  Yeah  I think it would be hilarious  But all of a sudden  I want to go lay down somewhere  Yeah that'll be hilarious  For everyone except me  Like Joe Rogan saying  Opie's asleep  Yeah  Passed out  But yeah it was fun

[01:40:30]  But  Golden Globes  Oh out there  You must have been fucking  I'm surprised you got a hotel out there  No kidding  The hotel I stayed in  There wasn't a lot of people there  The London  I love the London  The London  London off Sunset Boulevard  The London  Overlooking the Whiskey-A-Go-Go  Oh  Was the pool open?  Yeah but it was fucking freezing out there  I heard it was cold out there  Fucking freezing  Yeah  So you couldn't go on the roof deck really  I mean you could  But it wasn't fun  Not comfy  I'm going and I'm going  You stayed there when it was something else  Wyndham Bellage 
[01:41:00]  Was that what it was called before London?  That's the  When I met Dice  That's where I stayed  It was me, Florentine  Yeah  Me, Florentine  Rich Franchese  And Lenny Marcus  In the same room  Yeah  Oh alright  It used to be  But that  It used to be a burning  Is there a hot tub up there now?  Yeah  Well there used to be a hot tub  And now it's a fire pit  There's something switched  When they change  Oh you know what  Maybe it's a fire pit  Yeah it used to be a hot tub  I think it was a hot tub when we went  When it was  Yeah the other joint  Melinda watched me hit on a girl up there  Oh yeah  And she said 
[01:41:30]  I was  I remember that  And I was flirting with this girl  Yeah  And Melinda said it was like  Watching an interrogation  I just asked her questions  Yes  You were fucking asking questions  So where are you from?  Sitting in the jacuzzi all creepily  And then she just got up and left  Canada?  What are you doing?  Are you having a good time?  Oh cool  Yeah me too  How well are you staying for?  You like this hotel?  I was fucking awful  And she's just answering questions  I didn't realize man  The podcast world is extremely competitive  Really?  Yeah I think Jay Moore's mad at me  Because I didn't do his podcast before Rogan's  See what you gotta do? 
[01:42:00]  Those guys are playing that game  See what you gotta do?  Are they all playing that game?  Aren't we all friends?  Well they probably want you to do both of them  That's all  As a group we're all friends  I don't know individually who gets along with who  But the LA trip was supposed to be a quick in and out  You know  And then Rogan  I'm gonna explain this on the air  I still gotta explain it to Jay Moore  But then Rogan got wind  I was in LA through my Twitter  And he wrote me  He goes  Hey you wanna do my podcast?  Someone dropped out  Of course I'm gonna say yes  Oh hell yeah  And that's something that's been 
[01:42:30]  I didn't go out there with the intention of doing anyone's podcast  That's something that we've been talking about for a while though  If we're ever in LA  Right  You gotta do Rogan's podcast  Yeah  You know  I mean  And I'm not gonna invite myself  I know I have an open invite with Jay Moore  But you know  I didn't have an intention  You know  You wanna fuck Jay Moore over  You're entitled  Absolutely  Nerds to Jay  Nerds  He does a good job on the podcast too though  I love his podcast  He's a really really good interviewer  And I look forward to doing it  But I was like 
[01:43:00]  Wow  Wow these guys are getting competitive  Yeah  It's crazy  The fuck  Maybe we should be competitive with the podcast  Oh  We're competing with those guys now  Yeah  Damn  Fuck them all  Rogan's got a good setup  And I'll tell ya  I mean  We were talking about some shit  And next thing you know  He's popping it on the screen  Like we do here  Just for us  But then you forget that  It's  The audience is also seeing  He's live streaming it  Before it goes up  Why can't we do that  That's the best fucking thing  You know  Cause like  We obviously referenced 
[01:43:30]  Baby Bird  Because you know  Rogan was the one that  Pretty much came up with that  When him and Bill Burr  Were in the studio  Was Bill for that too  Yeah Bill Burr was in  And I didn't realize  But when we were watching the clip  I'm like  Holy fuck  Bill Burr was in that day as well  But also we're watching the clip  I haven't seen in a while  And then I'm like  Oh we don't have to over explain this  Right right  They're watching it  You know  The hardcore fans to his podcast  Are watching it as well  Yeah  Yeah  And it'll go up on the pod  Your Twitter feed will blow up  While you're on 
[01:44:00]  Because of his  You stream whatever it is  He does  Right  And then when you go on  When a podcast goes up  It'll blow up again  You get a lot of hits  From Joe's podcast  Oh man  Let me see  I think I got like  A fucking hundred new followers  Yeah you'll get a lot of people  I was hoping for more  Well it hasn't  But the podcast hasn't gone up  That was only the fucking stream  Yeah you just did  That's the stream  Wait  Podcast is up  Oh when did it go up  I guess early this morning  Okay  It just went up today  Wait so  That's from  Wait the only people 
[01:44:30]  That were watching  Were the ones on the live stream  Streaming  Yeah  Yeah that's just  That's almost like  Oh nice  So I might get another hit  Oh you will  You definitely will  Well I don't know  If I want another hit  Oh  Another hit  Get it  Is that you  Let me see  I can't see  That's Mr. Rogan  Of course  Rogan is  He's a very good broadcaster  Yes he is  He is a  Extremely good broadcaster  Seasoned  Do I look like  I took a baby hit  Oh man 
[01:45:00]  So it's video  So when you got up  To go to the bathroom  It was just an empty scene  Yeah and then I'm like  And then you know  Who else was in there with you  Red Ben  And the other dude  That's like more  Behind the scenes guy  I forgot his name  Shit  The director  He was really nice  See there's three fucking cameras  There's a couple cameras  You can also pot up  All of them at once  I think  Yeah yeah  You can do that view  Occasionally you'll see that  Looks great  That's an absolute  No brain thing to have  It's so 
[01:45:30]  No brainer  That's just a smart thing to do  Can't they make a little money off that  If we do it that way  Of course  The fuck is their problem  And it's everything  He's just on his laptop  So he'll punch up something  Or anyone in the room  Could punch something up  And then the audience is watching  As you talk about it  You do it for subscribers  Because like  People  Can't people listen online anyway  So why not let them watch online  Yeah  So I don't know  We gotta figure it out  See I did a little thing  Called the compound show  And I would do that  Right  Visible thing  You pop it up  People can see it 
[01:46:00]  It's fucking 2013  For the love of Christ  Can we fucking get a visual element  He is  He's the real deal man  He openly admitted that  The only reason he's doing his show  Is because of us  Yeah  Yeah he's  He's a cool guy man  I love Joe  Yeah  It's fun  And then everything was cool  We had  We had the perfect 3-4 hours  We talked afterwards a little bit  And then he's getting into this  Sick fucking car  And my car was there  That he got for me  And I opened up my car door 
[01:46:30]  Right into his fucking car  No  And all of a sudden  His eyes went like  Joe Rogan big  Rolls down his window  And goes  How bad is it  I'm like  It's not bad  I swear it's not bad  He goes dude  I'm returning this car  Next week  I go  It's not bad  Holy shit  Yeah  Oh my god  Because it was one of those sedans  Where those fucking doors  Seemed to open up  Like 20 feet  Were you embarrassed  When he did it  Oh  Was I embarrassed  Like why can't I have  Like just a perfect day 
[01:47:00]  There always has to be something  Whoa  And he was trying to be cool  But his eyes got really big  How bad is it  Of course they did  What kind of car was he in  It was a really nice car  I don't know if he wants me to say  Oh god no  It was very nice  And he was telling me  How much he loves that type of car  And then he's getting another one  He goes  I'm returning this  Thank god he's returning it  Yeah  Because that would have fucking  It was all like  We're hugging  You know  I'll see you in New York 
[01:47:30]  And you thud his car  And then I'm just  All is left is me  Having the nice cool  Rock star exit  And I open my door  Oh my god  Wow  That boy is right  Yeah people do not like that  No  A lot of turbulence  On this fucking flight  I like that  I don't like that on an Embraer  But on a big 757  It kind of rocks me to sleep 
[01:48:00]  A little bit  As long as you're not dropping  A thousand feet  But that little shaking  I kind of like  And I put  I put my coat  And my shit on the floor  And this plane came from  I think Colorado  And then I got  I'm cold  So I pick up my coat  It smells like coffee  I guess there was  Somebody  Spilt their coffee  From the last flight  You bitch  And my coat was the sponge  That soaked it all up  So now I'm  Trying to go to sleep  And I'm smelling  Someone else's coffee  All over my jacket  Oh man 
[01:48:30]  And it was on my blanket  Because they  They throw the blankets  Right on the floor  I guess  In case you want it  Or maybe that was a blanket  From the other flight  That no one used  So that smelled  I'm like  You could have asked  For another one  I was too tired  I just wanted to  Fucking close my eyes  And you got a little sleep  A little bit  I have to go home  To two kids too  I gotta be a trooper today  That American flight  Is the shit  Really  Yeah  You're flying tomorrow  Today  Today  After the Jim Norton show 
[01:49:00]  Oh the Jim Norton show  Right after this program  And then you're doing  What I just did  You're gonna go  Do it back and forth  Yeah I'm here Friday  Holy fuck man  That's crazy  I was supposed to be back  Yesterday  But when Joe said  You wanna do the podcast  Then of course  You know  You move mountains  I'm like fuck yeah  I'll change all my flights  You gave up a nice plane too  I know  You gave up that  Fucking live flat seat  Oh the live flat seat  You've done that obviously  Oh yeah  It's the best  You lay there with Pesci 
[01:49:30]  Spooning  That'd be great  I would've kept  You would have to  I mean he was in Raging Bull  Of course  You have to  You have to  You should've kept  Walking by going  You're stuttering prick yeah  Oh  Just throwing  You're stuttering prick yeah  Throwing lines at him  Hey you looking at me  Like raw movie lines  You looking at me  Hey I thought I told you  Go fuck your mother  Yeah  Just all inappropriate  Hey look in this way  Look in that way  Everyone in first class  Knew he was there  By the time we took off  Obviously right  I had that little interaction  It really wasn't much of anything 
[01:50:00]  But the guy  I was so embarrassed  With the guy thinking  He you know  Made a connection with them  He was waiting for them  They got their luggage together  Out of the overhead bin  And I think Joe  Kind of wanted to walk with someone  Because he didn't have any security  So I think  To talk  Yeah to talk  And he felt a little safe  Until he ran into his actual guy  And it keeps other people  From coming up maybe  Right  If he makes it look like  He's engaged  In a conversation  I mean you know  Pesci was just being nice  But the other guy  You could tell 
[01:50:30]  Was like kind of thinking  That he made someone  A fucking connection  When you walked away  This huge Hollywood star  When you walked away  Did you say  Now go get your fucking luggage  That would have been funny  Wrong movie lines  Would have been the best  Oh yeah  Wrong movie  Yeah  Just fucking old  Mean Streets lines  But here I'm just saying  Taxi driver  But here I'm just saying  I look half dead over here  Yeah  I look half dead  I'm sure you didn't want  Pictures  The answer to that  Would have been  The picture's only for me  It's going in my house  It's not to Twitter  I'm certainly not a professional 
[01:51:00]  Like you  Yeah I've learned  No because I've gotten  That response a few times  Where they're like  You're not going to  Peter Chris asked me that  The first time I got a picture  He goes  This is not going to go online  I'm like no  It's my own  Meanwhile  If Opie did say that  It would have been  The biggest lie ever  Because he would have  Put it up on Twitter  In a second  In a second  But now I've got to  Put the picture up  Of me  Of the nerds  The nerds  Always tell them  You're Opie though man  Because you've interviewed him  He will guilt him  Into taking the photo  That's you know  It's just  Back to fucking reality man 
[01:51:30]  Back to reality  That's my  That's my speed  Getting picture  A picture with nerds  Fuck  I don't even know  I can post this  I look like  Fucking  Shit  Shit  I don't feel like  Hearing it  That's how  Peshy feels  I know you flew  All night  And I haven't slept  In 30 hours  But you look like  Shit  AIDS  Is that the one 
[01:52:00]  You did  AIDS  Alright  We get it  So did  Did Armstrong  Admit everything  I'm really behind  Neil  Yes  They never went  To the moon  They never went  To the moon  It was all a farce  Put on by Disney  Who in return  For their  Cinematic favor  Got a bunch of  Land in Florida  That Canaveral  Used to own  That is now called  Disney World  Thank you 
[01:52:30]  Very much  Nothing like  Spilling coffee  On a nice white shirt  You bitch  I'm a fucking mess  What did Lance admit  Everything  But the sport  Was riddled  With drugs  Yeah  Yeah  I guess  He said  Yeah  He was doping  Right  But they were  All with doping  Yeah  That's like  The steroids  In baseball  It was  Apparently  A very big thing  And very  Covert  They had all kinds  Of things in place  To cover up  Sure 
[01:53:00]  That's why he was  Lying about it  It's like  Oh but he lied  About it  It's like  Well yeah  Because he had a  System in place  That covered it all up  Right  He was able to  Lie about it  What are you gonna do  I mean the thing is  Honestly  When you think  Oh he cheated  At a bicycle contest  Seems a little  Kind of inconsequential  To the fact  That the guy  Went through cancer  And fucking started  An organization  That's helped  A lot of fucking people  So you know what  Throw him a bone  As far as the little  Bicycle contest goes  Didn't it  That the cancer  Spread too  From his testicles  To his lungs 
[01:53:30]  And his brain  Like  Ow  The only problem  I have with Lance  So I'm sure  Is not that he lied  Because I understand  Like you know  It's hard  But the fact  That he was suing  People for defamation  And he won  I believe the London Times  Just immediately  Filed against him  For a half million  That he won from them  And he won like  7.2  Can you look that up  7.2 million  Wow  From somebody else  In defamation  So he was actively  Suing people  I believe  For libel  Or whatever the fuck  It is  I think  So that's my problem 
[01:54:00]  With him  But you're right  It's just a bicycle contest  Who cares  And they all  Were doing it  All of them  Most of the top writers  Anyway  If not all of them  It's kind of like baseball  Where everyone was just  Everyone knew that steroids  Was in baseball  Like it was  Yeah  They all feigned ignorance  And then they  Now when it comes to voting  They all vote no  Fuck you  All those sports writers knew  Didn't Sosa and Maguire  Save baseball  I mean nobody  Was watching  After that strike  Because  Sosa said so  You expect me to believe  Maguire was doping  Because  Sosa said so 
[01:54:30]  Of course  Yeah he was  Did he do the  Have they  Have they aired the interview  With Oprah  No it hasn't aired yet  Today  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  But it's already  Everyone knows  What's going to be said  Yeah everyone knows  What happened  And Lance Armstrong  Now he's getting sued  By people  Who settled with him  Yeah  For libel cases  Who's  The London Times  Half million  The other ones  For 7.2  They want  1.5 million 
[01:55:00]  From  Punitive damages here  From the London Times  No no no  Oh okay  1.5  They say he's worth  100 million  But who was it  That he got  7 million from  That is a lot  Sunday Times  Eric Logan says hi  By the way  But I couldn't  I couldn't squeeze it in  He's out there too  Oh that's cool  No the only reason  I'm bringing it up  Is because of the Oprah  Oprah  Oprah  He works with the Oprah  She still gets  Those big interviews man 
[01:55:30]  Yeah  Oprah gets information  Out of people  When you want to come clean  And do your mea culpa  That's what you go to Oprah  How about a youa culpa too  It's all  Oh fucking call me  You're a wordsmith  Pick us out you pig writer  Yeah did you hear that  He's writing a movie  Yeah  It made it to LA  And made it to LA  Hey that's where the industry is  Big buzz out there  Come on  All the producers  Were talking about it  In between sumo wrestling matches 
[01:56:00]  Oh man  And talkie sushi  That's the talk of Hollywood  Really  What is it  Everyone's waiting  Is he actually writing a movie  Good luck  About what  Good luck  Good luck  Did he try to tell you  Well basically  What we learned so far  Was that  An hour of prodding  He fucking won't come clean  An hour on this show  And then like 40 minutes  On the after show  So close to two hours  If the show blows up  His plan is to write a movie  That's like I said  What show is to blow up  Like if he  If he didn't work  For the Opie and Anthony show anymore 
[01:56:30]  He's gonna be a movie writer  He's got a movie that he's writing  And that would be his next gig  Here's the gist of the movie  It's an 18 year old guy  Right  Are you fucking around now  No  No this is it  It's present time  It's 2013  Whatever  14  Whenever he writes it  18 year old guy  Somehow  Not through a time machine  Somehow  In a way that  Iraq won't  Divulge  He ends up  In  Late 1940  And now  What?  Yes  Exactly 
[01:57:00]  We think it was through  A time portal  Like in the TV show  Sliders  No  He said no  He did  And I thought he hit his head  And went  And ends up in the 40s  How is he time traveling?  I don't know  Iraq won't come clean  Why won't you tell the people  How you're time traveling?  Comment  D-Rock  Sliders  It's not done yet  How much is written?  Do you have a treatment?  There's a lot  I don't know what that is  A treatment  A treatment is basically  Like a summation  Yeah  Of your film  That gets people  Here's what the film is about 
[01:57:30]  That's your treatment  Yeah  A treatment for you  Would be a shotgun  To the back of the throat  Weight watchers  I'm sorry  I didn't mean that  So here it is  It goes back to 1940  Now  As an 18 year old kid?  Yes  But how old is he really?  18?  Yeah  18 to 19  Is he 18 when he goes back to the 40s?  Yes  Why wouldn't his age change?  I don't know  Because he fell on the Sliders portal  Sliders portal  You're thinking  You're still going with the Sliders portal  So he's 18  In the 1940s  He then lives his life 
[01:58:00]  As we follow him  Through  The rest of the 40s  The 50s  The 60s  The 70s  The 80s  The 90s  The 1000s  Up until  Present time  Where he is then  An old man  Who then sees  What his  Progress through the years  How it affected  The 18 year old  That is now  In present time  That he is  Now sees  But he doesn't do anything  To affect history  Why?  We asked him 
[01:58:30]  You know what he doesn't do  By the way?  Why wouldn't you do anything?  He doesn't warn  About 9-11  Why?  He doesn't tell Kennedy  He's going to be shot  You're going to have to explain that  In your treatment  Yes  E-Rock  He doesn't even stop Newtown  Wait  He doesn't stop the Newtown shooting  Not at all  It's terrible  You're a sick fuck  You fucking are  Sick and twisted  Because it's not important  Piece of garbage  Because it's not important to him  Because he's very selfish  At 18  Now apparently  He remains selfish  Until he's 70  So he's 70  But is he 18  In the present day?  Yes 
[01:59:00]  And how is he 70 as well?  Exactly  Because he worked his way  Up through time  Right  In real time  Right  And met himself  Or knows of himself  Right  And sees what he did  Through all those years  Right  How it affected  This 18-year-old  But the real 18-year-old  Is going to start his  The rest of his life  In the year 2013  So what does that have to do  With the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s  Nothing  It's the time travel paradox  That apparently E-Rock  Won't even divulge  Or look into  Or anything 
[01:59:30]  I'm confused too  I'm confused  This annoyed the piss out of me  And then is there two people  Wandering around?  A 70-year-old man  In the present time  In the present time  Yes  There's two of them  Do they pal around?  No  But how could the 70-year-old guy  Be there?  But if I had a 70-year-old version of me  I would pal around with that guy  Why not?  But E-Rock  If the 70-year-old guy  Comes up to the 18-year-old  Right  And I'm giving away  The ending of the movie  And the 18-year-old  Never went back  Then the 70-year-old guy 
[02:00:00]  Couldn't exist  So how does he meet  The 18-year-old guy  Ex post facto  Exactly  Maybe at some point  He prevents the 18-year-old  From going back  Do you read  But then he would disappear  You read Stephen King novels?  Oh, the end of the movie  Oh, I just  I just read it out  The end of the movie  See, he prevents  But there's no time machine  How does he prevent it?  He puts a pillow under his head  Before he hits his head  When does he disappear?  No, it's close to the slider's portal  Yeah, he stops him  From going in the slider's portal  There's no slider's portal  Does he disappear when  The low cock  Does he disappear when winter hits? 
[02:00:30]  E-Rock comment  Anyone?  Uh-uh  The kid that fucking  Has fucking plants on his feet  Oh, right, right  Is it the kid with the plants on his feet?  And he has to go away  Because, you know  Winter comes  Don't forget  Our character also  Meets his love interest  Sometime in the late 60s  No, no  I believe they met in the 50s  Is it the 50s or the 60s?  50s  It's 10 years after he got there  Yeah, he met in the late 50s  Around the same time 
[02:01:00]  So early 50s  He gets a job at a radio station  Where Jimmy Norton  Is one of the bosses  Is that true?  Yeah  Yeah  Oh my god  Why are you squeezing Jim Norton  Into your movie?  Dude, we have been  Fucking interrogating him  Squeezy  I begged my way into this project  It's priceless  And expect him to come to you  For a producer fee  Like for you to back this movie  I never said I asked you for anything  Well, I just said expect it  I'm back in Voss' movie already  So he prevents him from going back 
[02:01:30]  I wrote a check to fucking Rich Voss  Oh boy  You're the first one in years to do that  A big one, too  That movie better come in, man  I want my money back  It sounds like Stephen King  But if he doesn't pay you  He's out of your life  For a few bucks  What are you going to do?  It sounds like a Stephen King  Fucking book  Is it based on Stephen King?  No  Is it based on A Wonderful Life?  Well  We were going through some movie titles  Forrest Plump  Of course  Of course  And a thousand others, Hopi  Of course 
[02:02:00]  None of them were complimentary  To E-Rock's waistline  I love the tweets yesterday  That were tweeting me  The lines you guys said yesterday  Like they never heard the show  Like they never heard  Lord of the Onion Rings  Was another one  Did you rework Hobbit?  The Hobbit?  Yeah, the Slobbit  Did you really?  Yeah  So  Wow  So what about the Django?  No  No, we missed the Django  The Jumbo  We  So he goes to the future  Or at the present time  The old guy's there 
[02:02:30]  And then he prevents him  From going back  But if he prevents him  From going back  And the old guy disappears  Then he would never have been there  To prevent him from going back  And he would have gone back  You're stuck in a paradox loop  No, there's a way  There's ways around that  Oh, Jesus Christ  No, there isn't  No  All right, fucking Einstein  Because there's no way  Around a paradox  A time travel paradox loop  Is your time travel  Going to be clever?  Um  It could be  Hot tub time machine?  No  Sliders portal  No sliders portal  All right  Hot pocket time machine? 
[02:03:00]  That was good  How do you go back in time?  Through a shower?  Is it the shower?  I don't know  I'm just coming up with shit  No  Maybe your shower is a porthole  To back in time  Like a sliders thing?  Yeah  Yeah  Is it  How does he go back in time?  Can you give us a hint  How he goes back in time?  Until it's done  Whoa, God  That'll be forever  That's never gonna happen  So  No, he's got the software  For the computer 
[02:03:30]  To write a screenplay  Yeah, he bought  Final Draft  He bought Final Draft  How many pages  You got done?  I have a lot of notes  That I need to compile  Compile  Compust  Compile  Compile them under the locks  In the fireplace  Oh  He's got a kid  Almost famous  With post-it notes  All over the bathtub  You don't think  This will be a good story?  It's never gonna be written  Yeah  No, number one  It's not a good story  And number two  He'll never do it  So  I don't  I have faith in Iraq  You do  He's gonna write a movie  It's like Good Will Hunting 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah  Hey  Does Liberty Media  Dope test?  Oh shit  Uh-oh  Because now you're all  Fucked up, yo  You got piss tests  How many days?  It's over, Johnny  How bad would that be?  I don't know  The one time  They piss test everybody  And I swear to you  It's the first time  In so long  I can't even tell you  But I say a dope test  On this show  Is gonna get us in trouble  For a lot of different reasons  I think it was 20 years  20 years  20 years  Without a taste 
[02:04:30]  20 years  Did you get stoned?  A little hit  I don't know  To be honest with you  Did you feel like a little  Did you feel a little Chinese eyes?  Yeah, I felt it  Yeah, you were like a little  Yeah, I felt a little  Were you going  Felt a little mellow  Yeah  Maybe he was stoned  When he swung the car door open  Yeah, exactly  Man, the door's heavy, man  His first words  How bad is it?  Oh  Fuck  Jesus  Of course  I couldn't get out of there  How bad was it?  I couldn't get out of there clean  How bad was it, by the way? 
[02:05:00]  It was a good  He was in his car  And rolled down that window  Really fast  Donk  It was dark  That's why he was like  How bad was it?  It wasn't too bad  What color was his car?  I think it's alright  Is it black?  No, it's like  I don't know what color it was  Black would show a ding  Wow, I'd be a horrible witness  It was a lighter color  Yeah  I'm not going to just throw a color out there  Just to answer your question  I don't know for sure  Anyway  Can we break?  I mean  It's your show 
[02:05:30]  I'm just  No, it's fucking  I'm just coming in to visit  I'll be back strong tomorrow  I promise  Don't laugh  Yeah, alright  Well, screenwriter  Eric Nagel  Why don't you take us to break?  We should do a montage  Of the first things we say  When these mics go on  We should do a montage  Of the first things  Of the first thing  When these mics go on  We should do a montage  We should do a montage 
[02:06:00]  We should do a montage  We should do a montage  Because even after all these years  It's just dumb little noises  Ha ha  Noises  Ha ha  Noises  Noises  Ha ha  Noises  Noises  Ha, ha, noises  Ha, ha, noises  Make sure all the tones are there  Yeah, you gotta feel it out  Make sure all the tones are there  Yeah, you gotta feel it out 
[02:06:30]  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Ha, ha, ha, noises!  Ha, ha, noises! 
[02:07:00]  How we doing this morning?  Let's do it.  How we doing this morning?  Let's do it.  Let's do it. 
[02:07:30]  Noises.  Let's do it.  Noises.  Noises. 
[02:08:00]  Noises.  Noises.  Noises.  Noises.  SiriusXM.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Noises.  Is that the joint?  Jimmy, is that the joint right there?  No.  Yeah, no, no, no. 
[02:08:30]  What are you looking at, Sam?  It's Duke's.  No, it's not.  That's the original Duke's.  Oh, that's the original.  Original famous Duke's?  I had to tell Kenny that our joint closed down on Sunset Boulevard,  a place called Duke's, right next to the Whiskey A Go-Go.  Kenny would take me there when we would do our L.A. trips.  Just a little hole in the wall, but the food was good.  Oh, that little place?  Mm-hmm.  When did it close?  Do you know?  I wonder if I ate there with Florentine one time when I was out there.  I'm sure you ate there. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, Duke.  What else is going on, man?  Man.  I don't know.  We were watching some movies.  You know.  Saw the Django.  You did?  Yeah.  What did you think?  I thought it was a little too long.  Really?  Yeah.  I started going like...  Enough already?  Yeah.  It was kind of like...  Why are people praising this movie?  I liked it.  I liked it a lot.  But it was that length thing.  It was kind of like...  How did the N-word feel?  It was fun, you know.  It was fun, you know.  It was fun. 
[02:09:30]  It was fun.  I love Samuel Jackson.  Did it feel uncomfortable around that shit?  No.  They were cartoony people.  But your theater doesn't have a lot of people, so...  The theater I go to, yeah.  Not many people at all.  It was wonderful.  Never anyone that would be offended at that word.  No.  No.  But you thought it was long, but you liked it a lot.  Yeah, I did.  I liked it.  How long was the movie?  It's like 2.45.  Oh, fuck.  That's too long.  Fucking long movie, man.  That's too long.  You could chop 20 minutes off and it would...  Even only 20 minutes would be kind of cool.  Right. 
[02:10:00]  But, yeah.  I liked it.  I saw Argo, which resembles nothing of really what happened.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, it won the Golden Globe for what?  I know.  For a director.  Ben Affleck.  A picture.  A picture.  Unfortunately, I watched the documentary kind of right before I saw the movie.  So, the documentary of it showed that, honestly, they were never in danger.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That would pump it up a little bit?  Yeah.  If they would have gotten caught, it would have sucked.  They would have maybe been killed.  And the American hostages and the Canadians and everybody would have been in danger. 
[02:10:30]  But, all they had to do was give them their passports and send them to the airport and  they would have been fine.  They didn't need the cover story.  They didn't need anything.  Well, that wouldn't make a good movie.  Exactly.  You can't have that in a movie.  Just them going home.  Right.  Hey, we're going home.  Just can't have that.  Yeah.  So, they made this chase action.  Like, time was of the essence thing.  No.  How great was the hostage takeover scene, though?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  That was really well shot.  Just watching in the security cameras as they're running over the fence.  And then the cameras are just going out. 
[02:11:00]  That would be fucking frightening, man.  But the difference is, back then, I don't think they beat the hostages.  I heard there was some beatings.  Okay.  But they didn't kill them.  No.  Not one hostage was killed.  How many days was that?  400 and something?  444.  444 is right.  Right.  Pretty fucking bad.  Are you eating beef jerky?  Yeah.  From a listener?  It's like wood bark.  Well, here's what happened.  Someone sent some.  I see it.  It was sealed.  Oh, okay.  I broke the seal.  Oh, okay. 
[02:11:30]  I'm sure he didn't do anything before you sealed it.  You're fine.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  I do like a good jerky.  Is it venison?  No, it's beef.  It is beef jerky?  It's very dry.  Western New York, they like their venison beef jerky.  I'm not a big fan of the venison jerky.  No?  I'll tell you the God's honest.  Yeah.  You like beef jerky.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to try it.  You're going to try some?  Kimmy.  No.  It's dry like your teeth, Edgar.  Edgar.  Edgar, I don't know how you're going to eat it because it's very dry. 
[02:12:00]  You need some saliva, which Edgar lacks.  It looks like chocolate.  I know, right?  It's tree bark.  Is it good?  It's jerky.  It's jerky.  It's jerky.  So what's going on with the gun shit?  Oh, it's crazy.  Without jumping in the pool.  I hear you.  Just put your toe in, please.  All right.  Does Jimmy know this analogy?  Oh, about me jumping full bore into the pool?  Last week when you weren't in, he was itching to jump in the pool, meaning all in with the gun shit.  Where I start yelling like I did yesterday morning. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, yesterday morning.  But I was begging him and I was able to get him back to the cabana before he jumped all in.  Yeah, yeah.  I just explain it.  Right.  Well, here's the deal.  So I just want like a toe in the water if that's okay.  Is that cool?  I'll give you exactly what's going on.  Or are you going to go in the shallow end?  You're not climbing up on the diving board, are you?  I'm just putting my tootsies in on the top step of the shallow end.  All right, good.  There we go.  What did Cuomo pass?  Because don't we have strict gun control laws in New York?  So what did he pass?  Here's what he did.  Right before midnight, minutes after they released the text, which gave no time for public debate 
[02:13:00]  or anything, they signed a bill that restricts assault weapons.  It puts an assault weapon ban in place that's tougher than the one that was in place.  Now it's a semi-automatic rifle with one of any of these military options that they talk about, which are purely aesthetics.  Magazines for everything. 
[02:13:30]  Rifles, pistols, everything.  Now limited to seven rounds.  That's it.  What?  You can only put seven bullets in your clip now.  And not only put in, you can only have magazines that will only fit seven rounds.  They don't make them.  They don't make a seven-round magazine.  So now you're going to...  Well, this is how they got around saying, we want you to only have five-round mags.  They say, oh, we'll give you seven-round mags.  They make tens.  And fives?  And make fives.  So now everyone's going to have to use a five.  And they're going to have to go out and get their five, so that's going to be good business. 
[02:14:00]  That, or you could take your ten and, through your own cost, have it modified so it only accepts seven by putting some kind of block in the bottom.  Now this is not going to affect me at all.  Like, what does that do for you?  I have a...  Is it a nightmare?  That's the only part of it.  Yeah, a huge nightmare.  Really?  So you've got to be out of your mind.  I have magazines that were pre-banned.  The only 30-round magazines you're allowed to have now are ones that were made before 1994.  That's the only 30-round mags you're allowed to have. 
[02:14:30]  So the bad guys will only be walking around with fives?  Well, now you're not even allowed to have those.  What do you mean?  You can't have the pre-banned 1994 30-round mags.  Every 30-round magazine you have now has to be eliminated.  But I'm just saying.  And the bad guys will get rid of their 30 mags.  They're going to throw them all away.  All right.  They'll throw them all away because they're good people.  All right, that's good.  Anything deemed an assault weapon, if you own it now, you're allowed to keep it.  But you have to take them all somewhere.  I guess this is going to be explained to us. 
[02:15:00]  And have them all registered.  Wow.  Now, everything's registered already.  When I bought my gun, all the info went through.  How did they get all this through?  Because they signed it at midnight without any fucking body seeing it.  Wow.  Yeah.  So now I have to take probably 12 guns.  What if you don't?  Somewhere.  Then a law-abiding citizen.  Hold on.  I'm not saying you, by the way.  I understand.  What if Joe gun owner doesn't do that? 
[02:15:30]  Will they know that Joe gun owner did not do that?  Yes, they will.  How?  Because you already have a record of the sale.  Oh, so it's going to have to match up.  Right.  What if you sold that gun?  Then they want to know who you sold it to.  Who you sold it to.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then the person that you sold it to has to register it.  And if you don't, then the legal law-abiding citizen that was doing nothing wrong, just  owning his guns, paying attention to his Second Amendment right, now becomes a criminal. 
[02:16:00]  Wow.  A criminal.  It's going to, believe me, not everyone is going to do this.  Some on purpose.  Some just because they don't know the new laws.  Right.  And you will be turning honest people that meant no harm, that were conducting business  legally, and you're turning them into criminals.  Wow.  And it's really obvious, it's going to do nothing.  Now there's also this mental health part of the legislation.  Well, that's what I'm more curious about.  Yeah.  This is a little weird.  I think that's...  It's a little scary.  That's my soft spot.  It's a little scary. 
[02:16:30]  Why?  Well, it says that if...  Can I lock my mom up?  Please, please tell me, tell me, tell me.  If a mental health professional hears somebody talking about killing or killing themselves,  causing harm to somebody with a gun, they now must report that person to a Department  of Health official who will then report it to the authorities who will then suspend that  person's license and take their guns out of their house.  So we get to turn people in now? 
[02:17:00]  Exactly.  That's weird.  It's very weird.  And we have to.  Because what's the...  I was saying...  Because then you would get in trouble if you don't.  Right.  Wow.  What the fuck happened since I left?  I don't know.  I was saying that, like, my rant's on the air when I'm like, I'd like to put a fucking  bullet in his head and shit.  Can that be interpreted, maybe not under this legislation, but maybe when this doesn't work  other people die and they go, we haven't gone far enough, would that be part of the legislation  where I can't even joke like that or talk about it on the air without having my guns taken 
[02:17:30]  away?  Man, they mean business, huh?  Holy fuck!  If Cuomo's leading the way, he's the first one?  Cuomo was up there like Hitler at Nuremberg, screaming about guns, and it's done.  Now...  Will his security guys be disarmed a little bit?  Only seven bullets.  Only seven bullets for his security team.  Oh, that's right.  They'll have full automatic MP5s under their jacket.  This world's crazy.  I have certain guns that I don't know where I'm getting magazines for these guns for seven 
[02:18:00]  rounds or if the magazines can even be modified for seven rounds.  I have a Barrett .50 caliber.  The magazine on it is huge.  It's the size of an old Walkman, like, and it holds 10 rounds.  I don't know how...  First of all, they don't make a...  And they never will make a seven-round Barrett .50 caliber magazine.  Why can't they just trust you to only put seven?  Put seven.  I'm only gonna put seven in.  Put seven in.  It's a matter.  It's a matter.  I'm putting seven in.  Right.  Also, any magazine I have for my P89, which is like an MP5 little mini machine gun thing, 
[02:18:30]  I have 30-round mags for that and a 10-round mag.  They don't make seven rounds and it doesn't look like these can really be modified either.  So, I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do as far as those guns go.  The pistols, there's a few that take...  The main carry gun has a magazine that fits nine rounds.  I don't know.  I gotta fuckin' now figure out how to make it so it only fits seven rounds. 
[02:19:00]  No, the dude just carries seven rounds.  Carry it like that, but if a cop pulls up, just pop two bullets out.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it'll push down on the top and go, well, I could fit two more in, so you're guilty.  You're not allowed to have a clip that even fits 10, never mind putting 10 in or nine in.  You need the clip to only fit seven bullets.  And if you try to put eight in, the eighth won't go in.  And this is only New York.  Now, I've had a lot of people tweeting me and shit and saying, I'll take your...  You know, I live out of state.  I'll take all your 30-round mags.  Can I have them?  Give me your 30-round mags. 
[02:19:30]  I'm like, hey, dummy, Obama speaks today at like 1130, and he's doing the same fuckin' thing.  There's gonna be magazine...  He's unveiling what he's gonna do?  Yeah, today.  His executive order?  Well, we're not sure which ones he's gonna use executive privilege for or which ones have to go through Congress.  Is it order of privilege?  It's order executive privilege.  Okay.  What they're talking, though, is what he's gonna try to get past is an assault weapons ban.  And magazines that only fit 10 rounds or less. 
[02:20:00]  Will the country be outraged by this?  Holy shit.  So what are they gonna do?  What are the gun people gonna do?  Well, this will have to go through Congress.  Shouldn't this be their time to stand up?  Well, yeah.  Stand up a little bit?  I would think.  I think each state is gonna have to put this through the Supreme Court and see if it's constitutional.  So that's gonna take forever.  There's gonna be all sorts of lawsuits, right?  Yeah, this is all gonna...  New York itself did this on its own.  So we're fucked.  Ah, automatic weapons. 
[02:20:30]  What are you, what are you, hunting deers they have on bulletproof vests?  Ah, makes not a bit of sense to me.  Really, regular Joe?  Wow.  Good old regular Joe.  I missed regular Joe.  Yeah, regular Joe.  No.  I don't know.  Yeah, so we find out a little later what Obama is gonna run through Congress and what he's...  Is he gonna ban violent video games and all that shit?  Because, you know, Biden was looking at all that.  Yeah, yeah.  Banning violent video games.  No, I don't know what he's gonna do as far as that.  That's a First Amendment issue. 
[02:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  They won't address the media either.  That's a lot tougher.  They will never address the media and its impact.  Yeah, the politicians should be addressing the media.  You know why the media is not gonna address the media?  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's their business.  Right, right.  I'm so surprised that not one politician has stepped forward and said, look, you guys  gotta fucking knock it off.  You're glorifying these people.  Yeah.  They never will.  Never.  Right.  Mm.  So now we'll see what Obama says and see what the different states say.  Texas has said they will arrest any federal agent that tries to enforce any gun bans that 
[02:21:30]  are put in place.  Really?  Wow.  Texas is fucking not kidding around.  Well, Texas is not gonna be part of America soon.  Well, I would move to Texas then in a second.  You know they want to do their own thing.  If they were able to secede from the union, I would move to Texas in a second.  Yeah, we'll see them secede from the union the first time somebody, Mexico, wants to  move in and take over with their military.  Yeah, I know.  They'll arrest a federal agent?  Yeah, they said they would have a federal agent arrested for... 
[02:22:00]  Texas is very into their sovereign state rights, man, and they don't like when the government  pokes their...  When the federal government pokes their...  And they will arrest a federal agent.  Yeah.  And then, you know, deal with it in court later.  But, you know, see if there's what the legality is to that.  But, Obama will put in place some type of gun regulation, and we'll see which ones he  just signs as the president and slips past Congress, and which ones are gonna have to  go through Congress.  I think things like a magazine restriction might go through Congress. 
[02:22:30]  An assault weapons ban, he's not gonna be able to just sign off on by himself.  That's gonna have to go through Congress.  This mental health legislation, I think there's gonna be something involving that, whether  it's similar to the one that's in New York.  That's another story.  I don't know.  That's the scary thing, because it's such a gray area.  What's the criteria for saying that somebody isn't mentally fit to have a gun?  You know him when you see him. 
[02:23:00]  Well...  You could look at someone and go, that person shouldn't have a gun.  But there are plenty of people that are nutty and look normal and shit.  Of course, yep.  Because...  Thank you, Jimmy.  Just because they say something, is it perceived as a real threat?  A joke?  In context?  A pun?  Whatever.  Well, let me ask you this.  With all the new legislation, they have to have tougher penalties if you're caught with  this shit.  That was another thing.  Or this isn't gonna work.  Much tougher penalties, they say. 
[02:23:30]  And this is where I do completely agree with you on gun control.  It's not gonna stop the bad guys from getting their shit.  Yeah.  So now the penalties have gotta be way worse to make those people think twice.  No?  They've...  So what are they gonna do with that?  They are.  They've legislated to make tougher penalties for illegal gun ownership, gun ownership,  using a gun in the commission of a crime, shooting first responders.  Uh, all these are tougher, tougher penalties.  But here's another little fuck you to the legal gun owner.  Uh, when this is signed by the governor, these restrictions and assault weapon bans and magazine 
[02:24:00]  capacity bans go in place immediately.  The tougher law regulations for criminals?  Right.  60 days it goes in effect.  Why wouldn't you do it immediately?  How come the criminals get a 60 day buffer to do whatever the fuck they please, and the  legal gun owner, it's immediately when it's signed, we are fucking all of a sudden criminals.  They have to comply right away.  So this is a dark day for you. 
[02:24:30]  It really has been very depressing, stressful.  Um, I, I feel like I've lost something.  Um, I'm frustrated, angry.  I did a Hannity, um, Hannity's, uh, I, I did a phone-er, um, debate with a woman on Hannity's  radio show yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Nice.  Slaughtered her.  So why didn't you go in and do that live?  Uh, hey, they just...  That phone shit's weird.  Do a phone-er.  It was cool.  I'm doing a wacky game show and you're fucking, uh, debating gun control.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Assault weapons.  I mean, uh, what are the other ones for?  They tickle ya?  They don't make a bit of sense to me, guys.  Regular Joe, just fucking, he says it all.  Uh, and then, uh, uh, the blaze.  Is anyone in control here?  I did an interview.  Who's in control here?  No one.  He's out of control.  Spinning.  Uh, I, I did a, a, an interview with blaze, with the blaze, with, uh, Stunty.  Stunty.  And then today, I think at noon, I'm doing a, um, a skyped in, uh, interview on their, um,  webcast.  Go to guy. 
[02:25:30]  Uh, I'm Mr. Fucking Second Amendment.  Why don't you go to their studio to do it?  Uh, I gotta go back to Long Island.  So I'm gonna do it.  The studio's nice though.  I, I hear, I've been there.  I've been there.  50 bucks if you stand up.  Naked.  And you have no pants on.  Yeah.  That would be hilarious.  Yes.  Why not?  I almost did that on Lowry King.  Why not?  God.  They wanted me to Skype in for something and I didn't do it.  Oh, you should do that.  God.  I don't think I would do that.  It might underplay the seriousness of my point.  So you're becoming the go-to guy.  Oh, I'm trying. 
[02:26:00]  You know, I did red eye, uh, and they, they showed the list, uh, where I'm, I'm listed  on their gun owners in New York City, uh, ones with concealed carry permits.  Well, I'm available to do more prank, uh, TV shows.  That's my strength.  Why don't you just do another goofy show?  Oh, God.  AIDS!  Oh, God.  Yeah, Rogan asked about the past. 
[02:26:30]  I'm like, I'm scared shitless of them.  They're supposed to support us, but they fucking turn on us, too.  They're animals.  Yeah.  Yeah, I tell you, those listeners, oh, boy.  What about them?  Uh, it's just like trying to rein in a Wolverine with a shoestring.  Don't make a bit of sense to me, guys.  Nothing seems to make sense to regular Joe.  Whole world's going, uh, just, you know, plum crazy.  Hell in a handbag?  Down to tubes. 
[02:27:00]  So, Obama speaks at 11?  11.30?  Yeah, around there.  Joe Biden has been, you know, meeting with people.  And, um, of course, not saying anything, uh, to the public.  Just nodding a lot.  Yeah.  Having those photo-ops.  Uh-huh.  That's what they do.  This is one of these feel-good things.  Um, obviously, Andrew Cuomo is, is running for president in 2016.  Let's, let's be real here.  Is he really?  Yeah.  It's obvious.  What about Christie?  Uh, well, you know, then Christie better get in there with, uh, some gun control legislation. 
[02:27:30]  Because, uh, uh, Cuomo was obviously doing this to advance his political career.  It's going to do nothing for what people think it's going to do.  Uh, there was already an assault weapons ban, um, in Connecticut.  It was already there.  What, so what, what good will another one do?  People that are crazy, and criminals, they're going to use bad, they're going to use guns to do bad things.  You want to figure out the problem, don't restrict the hardware. 
[02:28:00]  Find out where, what the problem is.  And restrict the hardware.  Well, I don't think so.  Let's get some.  How about a little bit of everything?  How about we get some of that shit off the streets?  You know what?  How about a little bit?  I, I, I walk down the streets.  How about just a little bit?  There's guns on the streets.  I'd pick them up, I'd go to the cops, I'd go, look, there's a gun over there on the street.  Why don't you get that?  Take this.  Pick that up.  Pick that up.  You see the lady that's, uh, melting them down and making bracelets in Newark?  Oh, really?  How's that, how's that working out for her?  She thinks she's making a difference.  I'm making a difference.  And they're all like, oh my god, you're making a difference. 
[02:28:30]  Ugh.  And she goes, I know, I know, I'm making a difference, right?  Yeah, you're making a difference.  I hope her foundry explodes and she fucking gets coated with molten steel.  Yes.  Yes, her foundry exploded.  It's metal bracelets out of the guns.  Oh, that's sweet.  She's making a difference.  Yeah, she's, uh, she's, um, turning swords into plowshares.  That's right.  Uh, I don't fucking know.  I'm just, I've been disgusted.  I don't know what to do with some, I'm very confused as to what to do with these. 
[02:29:00]  And the other thing, by the way, what do you think?  What do you think?  I'm gonna be able to parade up to wherever I'm supposed to go with my weapons and have  them registered and just go, alright, thanks!  Or am I gonna have to cut some more fucking checks and dole out some cash for these fees?  It'll cost you.  It'll cost you.  It's gonna cost.  Yet another fucking tax, another fee that I have to give the fucking government for the  complete lack of freedom that they're, uh, giving us. 
[02:29:30]  Less freedom every day.  I went through that shit, uh, talking about that shit yesterday that we, we had touched  on in the past about that you're not free to do anything.  Right.  It's like grab a fishing pole.  Go, go fishing.  Right.  Go ahead and see what happens.  Oh, you got a license?  Right.  You're not able to fish here?  You're not allowed to catch that fish at this time of year.  Go hunting to feed your family.  Oh, what, you got a deer tag?  No.  You're not even supposed to be hunting with that gun in this month.  Right.  On this land.  Right.  You're not free to do anything.  Don't, go, go, you're done working for your life.  You've made everything for yourself.  Go to your house, sit down and just enjoy the rest of your life. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, what, property taxes?  You didn't pay them?  Your shit's ours now.  But you can put a pool in your backyard.  Oh, right.  After fucking paying off the local government.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Paying off the local government for fence variance fees.  Yeah, the fishing thing's annoying.  Wow.  If your fish is too small, they're going to charge you.  Yeah.  They're going to write you up.  There's, you can't do anything.  I was saying, try to get from point A to point B anywhere.  Unless you walk, you have to follow rules or you get in trouble. 
[02:30:30]  Is it true you can't even go to parks on Long Island anymore?  Don't you have to get like a park and recreation fee or something?  Yeah, yeah.  I have a leisure pass that I had to buy in Nassau County.  A leisure pass.  A leisure pass.  And what does that get you?  It gets you everything that you pay fucking taxes for in the first place.  Parks, yeah.  When I go to the gun range, I have to pay a fee to use the range.  Right.  I have to pay money. 
[02:31:00]  But I also needed a leisure pass to even be able to go in to pay money to use the shooting range.  And you have to show the leisure pass?  Yes.  Your leisure.  What the fuck's a leisure pass?  It's just another way to get more money from you.  How much is it?  I don't know.  It was like 30 bucks, something like that.  For the season?  No, it's a, is it one year?  Yeah, what are the taxes for then if you have to get a leisure pass?  No.  It's the same thing.  That's what your taxes are supposed to be paid for.  You know what it is?  It's like the seats at Giant Stadium.  You have to buy the license before you can even buy the seat. 
[02:31:30]  With this, you need a leisure pass before you can even pay to use their stuff.  Can't go anywhere anymore.  I, I'm beside myself as they say.  Look, I'm right there.  What are you, in E-Rock's movie?  I'm beside myself, E-Rock comment.  Is that the name of the movie?  Oh, oh.  Ask him the name of the movie.  You got the name of the movie, E-Rock?  I do.  What's the name?  I'm not telling.  Ah, we have clues. 
[02:32:00]  He won't tell us.  We have clues.  Why?  Is it a clever name?  It's five words long.  Five words.  Six words.  No, six words long, the title.  Really?  One of the words in it is the, but it's not at the beginning of the title.  And that's all he's telling us.  It's like a puzzle, right?  I was toiling, toiling over this yesterday.  I got it.  What is it?  Wow, look at the fat kid.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  My nickname is the stupid pig.  Oh, no.  Is it one of those two?  Sorry.  This isn't gonna help him, you know.  Give us another word in the title. 
[02:32:30]  I know, give us one more word.  One more word in the title.  Come on.  Are you worried someone's gonna steal this?  Yes, he is.  He's crazy.  Travel.  No.  Time.  No.  Portal.  No.  Old.  Slider.  No.  Backwards.  Matrix.  Backwards?  Back.  No.  Back to the future.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Backwards is in it.  We figured out another word.  No, I said no.  Oh. 
[02:33:00]  Damn it.  He might be trying.  Forward.  He might be trying to throw us off though.  No.  Two.  Is two like T-O?  No.  We've guessed every word.  The.  Is.  Is.  Nope.  Good.  What's up with that cough?  Exactly.  Tuberculosis.  Justin Stengel has a guess to what the title is, and he's like a Hollywood guy, so he  would know.  He's texted.  Look at who's giving your movie this attention.  All right.  You rock.  What is he saying?  It's probably right from Letterman, by the way.  Yeah.  He thinks it might be, can I have more pie, please? 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  Oh.  That's ridiculous.  He never asks.  No, there's no the in it.  Exactly.  He just puts his face in it and eats it like you fucking oats out of a trough.  Oh.  Can I have the pie, please?  Oh, okay.  Is that what it is?  No.  You sure it's not that?  Positive.  Is the word, all right, mayo in it?  No.  Incompetent?  Maybe.  Adventure?  No.  Slob?  Nope.  Slovenly?  I don't like where this is going.  How about sloppy? 
[02:34:00]  How about unkempt?  How about unkempt?  Unshaven?  He's not going to...  He's not budging on this one.  Come on, Iraq.  Come on, you...  Nope.  Nope.  Not good.  He's banking on this one.  He really is.  This is his go-to project.  And I was like...  I was like...  I was asking him why he didn't come up with a movie that's more like Clerks, your first  movie, something small.  He's got this giant multi-decade period piece.  Who's going to direct it? 
[02:34:30]  I don't know.  Do you have a director in mind?  Ridley Scott?  How about I finish the script first before I worry about that?  No, you got an idea.  Who do you want to direct your big movie?  Of course you don't have an idea.  Ron Howard?  No.  He's pretty terrific.  He doesn't have a director in mind, but what he wants to do is hang on to...  Oh, right.  I have a decision in the casting.  Yes.  The soundtrack.  Who do you want to cast?  And he wants a producer title.  Who are some of the people you're looking at to be cast in your movie?  I haven't looked at it.  And when he says he hasn't thought about it...  You have thought about it.  If you have a lead character, you absolutely have this image.  And is it him? 
[02:35:00]  No.  The character's not based on you?  It's not the E-Rock story.  A young boy born and raised in Florida.  So who do you have in mind for the young...  You're full of turkey.  The young version of this...  I haven't picked anybody.  Who do you have as the 18-year-old?  Come on.  If you've got a treatment or you've got this idea, somewhere in your head you're thinking,  oh, I would love to see if Leonardo DiCaprio was available.  Who's the brash 18-year-old?  Yeah.  Or the old guy.  Edward Furlong.  Edward Furlong.  You bringing him back?  He could play multiple ages.  E-Rock?  Corey... 
[02:35:30]  Corey Feldman.  Corey Feldman.  Corey Feldman?  Is Corey Feldman?  No.  Yeah.  Give us who you're thinking for the old guy.  I haven't picked anybody for it yet.  Yeah, but you kind of know.  No, I don't kind of know.  When you think about this character, who does he look like as far as Hollywood goes?  In your face.  Who does he look like?  Who does he look like?  I don't know.  I have to think about it.  Joe Pesci?  You have thought about it.  You've thought about it.  Why is Pesci in New York?  Is he coming this way? 
[02:36:00]  How do you know?  Does he do interviews here?  No?  I have not heard.  Huh?  He's not on the list.  He might be doing TV.  He might be shooting.  I'm so mad.  Man, you got shot down.  Fuck.  You got shot down.  That's a tough one.  A Pesci shoot down.  I would have just kept saying, you stutter and prick ya.  It would be fucking great.  He'd have loved it.  Yeah.  He gave me that look though, man.  You know he means business.  Yeah.  For the people that don't know, Pesci was on my flight and I went to my seat and he  was sitting in my seat.  And I didn't know it was Pesci yet when I said you were in my seat. 
[02:36:30]  When did you realize it was him?  When he handed you his ticket, did you look and said Joe Pesci?  It said Joe on it and then it all came together.  I'm like, holy fuck, that's Joe Pesci.  Did you say that to him?  You idiot.  No.  Holy fuck, you're Joe Pesci.  I was trying to be cool and he's like, what does it say here?  Where do I sit?  Oh, the poor old guy.  I think it was 4B.  I go, you're over there.  And then I was in the wrong seat.  No, I'm not.  I'm over here now.  Right.  And then I think the guy that became friends with him on the flight or so that guy thinks. 
[02:37:00]  He thinks.  He went to him.  He's like, do you want the window?  And the guy's like, no, you can have the window.  Oh.  So he was aggressively trying to get a window seat so he could put his little head down.  Oh, wait, so Pesci might have had an aisle seat.  Yeah.  Oh, so he switched to a window.  Yeah, that's all.  I think so.  That's why he showed you his ticket.  I was right.  Yeah, yeah.  He wanted you to see his name and make sure you know it's Joe Pesci so you wouldn't say  that.  Right.  I would have said, you know, my mother always thought your name was Joe Pesci.  I would have sat down next to him and just told a bunch of stories about my good old 
[02:37:30]  mother.  Hmm.  Do you have to use that kind of language?  Or I would have said, who's that annoying bitch that played your mother in Goodfellas?  Hey, you want to hear?  They opened the books.  They're giving you a window seat.  Yeah.  Hey, remember when you got whacked in Goodfellas?  Fuck, dude.  Fuck.  It was awesome, dude.  What else is going on, man?  Oh, Josh Gad's coming in?  Tomorrow.  Oh, Friday. 
[02:38:00]  Nice.  He's promoting that show.  1600 or whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  And Andrew Rannells has a show, too.  Both of those guys.  Hmm.  I'm going to see a play on Sunday.  No, you're not.  Oh, shit.  Wicked?  No.  What play?  Oh.  Jersey Boys?  I don't know.  No.  Ross Gary with Glenn.  Who knows what it's called?  Oh, really?  How'd you score the ticks?  I had to pay for them.  It's the final performance.  Ooh.  With a Mr. Bobby Cannavale and a Mr. Al Pacino.  Do you think you'd be able to get backstage and meet Mr. Pacino? 
[02:38:30]  No.  Why?  Why is it the final performance?  The run is over.  It's a short run, isn't it?  I don't know.  It doesn't seem that it was on Broadway that long.  I'll tell you one reason I won't be able to because it's the last show.  They'll all be bonding and saying goodbye.  Yeah.  I'm pissed if that's where I'm going.  I wish I was just going to a regular fucking Friday show.  Sure.  But I know Bobby, so I would love to be able to.  Yeah.  Get in there.  Meet Patina.  Hey, Jim Norton.  Yeah.  You can look down. 
[02:39:00]  Hi.  I saw you.  You do those dirty jokes.  Hey, you're a tall drink of water.  Hey, pick me up.  Give me a kiss.  Shape me like a little baby.  Oh, that's good.  That should be good, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a date I'm bringing too.  Oh.  Do tell.  Lovely lady.  A young lady.  Like to meet her, Rupert.  Yeah.  Baba Kelly.  Oh, no.  You're taking the lovely Baba Kelly?  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  I said I had six seats to burn.  What am I going to do?  No.  I'm kidding.  Sick.  Sick.  Jesus.  Poor Bobby was in here yesterday.  But D-Rock was taking most of the abuse.  So Bobby actually jumped in on the fat show.  Oh, did he really?  Yeah.  He got all caught up in it.  Good for Bobby.  Oh, yeah.  It was good.  Yeah, it was good.  It was funny.  What is he promoting?  His new show on BET called Husbands of Hollywood.  The True Husbands of Hollywood.  It's like a mock reality show.  It's right after Fuck White People.  Yes.  I watched the new segment.  On BET. 
[02:40:00]  And then...  Who's coming in today?  Bubba Ray.  Bubba Ray.  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  It's Bully Ray.  Oh, he's not allowed to use Bubba?  Oh, God.  We're talking about that.  Vince fucked him so bad.  He's not allowed to use Bubba or Dudley.  Or Dudley.  Oh, my.  He goes by Bully Ray?  His name is simply Bully Ray.  Oh.  We're so calling him Bubba Ray the whole time.  Of course.  You know that, right?  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Yeah, Bubba Ray Dudley.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Yes, Bubba Ray Dudley.  What the fuck?  How much money does Vince need?  Every bit of it.  He let these guys have their names. 
[02:40:30]  He bought out all the ECW intellectual property rights.  Why?  So nobody can use their names.  He's a billionaire.  And he'll never use those names.  Right.  He'll just lock them up.  And these guys, when they work for him, they gotta stay in the shitty hotels and make their own  travel arrangements.  The least he could do is give them their names back.  Throw them a bone.  So what is he gonna do with Bubba Ray?  The name.  Just have it.  Just collect it.  Oh, God.  I know.  He's not even getting another wrestler to use that name?  No way.  He just sits there in a vault somewhere?  I mean, he might put out DVD that the Dudley boys are on it. 
[02:41:00]  No wonder his own son left him.  Left the organization.  What the fuck's up with Vince?  Hey, Vince has to pay for those failed fucking runs that his wife took.  It's true.  Jesus.  A lot of money.  Bully Ray?  Bully Ray is his name.  He's pretty successful in TNA.  Bullying is very topical now.  Is he successful as Bully Ray?  Yeah.  I mean, in TNA, yeah.  But when he walks out, does everyone just shout Bubba?  Well, the thing is, it's like when you're famous in WWE, it's not the same as being famous 
[02:41:30]  in TNA.  Oh, right.  You know what I mean?  Who's on the roster on TNA?  Like, their main guys, they have Jeff Hardy and Kurt Angle.  Kurt Angle.  How's Kurt doing?  He's still going.  He can still go.  Is he, you know.  Well, that's Bubba that, I guess.  Is he, you know.  Bully.  Taking care of himself?  Bully.  I don't know.  And his thing that he's promoting, tomorrow he's going to marry Brooke Hogan on TV.  Bully. 
[02:42:00]  That's the gimmick?  Yeah, he's marrying her tomorrow.  And then what happens?  How does Hulk feel about this?  Hulk's really upset.  Is Hulk going to get involved with this?  Well, Hulk is like, yeah.  I mean, he's.  Why is Hulk upset?  He's pissed.  Is Hulk part of the TNA thing?  Yeah.  Oh, he is.  Yeah.  Hulk's the, he doesn't wrestle, but he's like kind of like the.  But he's going to have to wrestle because of this angle?  I don't know.  Are they going to throw the big punches?  I'm going to tell you something, brother.  Is he going to say that?  He may. 
[02:42:30]  You better treat her.  He, he may very well refer to bullies.  That's my little girl.  Oh, is he going to.  It's the deal he made.  Hulk said, look, you know, give my fucking daughter a little heat.  Cause no one's talking about her for the last few years.  You give her a little heat.  I'll come out and do a little something, something, right?  You don't think her record's hot?  Oof.  We were so polite to her.  Oh, do we got some, uh.  And the publicist still wasn't happy, right?  No.  Let's hear a little, um, Bully Ray.  Bully Ray banter with Hulk Hogan.  And this is about him marrying Hulk's daughter. 
[02:43:00]  I think this is before he proposed.  Oh.  That excites.  But Hogan wants answers, you know?  Oh, he does.  Yeah.  Well, how about that?  The Hulkster calling out.  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray walking to the rim with purpose.  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  It sounds like you're saying Billy Ray.  Bully Ray looks good.  He's in really good shape now.  He brags about his cams a lot.  What is Hulk paint his fucking board?  I know.  His beard.  That's what it sounds like.  You don't think it looks cool.  Hogan has some questions.  And Hulk Hogan wants some answers from Bully Ray. 
[02:43:30]  Shoot Polish.  You need to lay it out straight, and you need to lay it out correct.  The first time.  Why would they do this in the middle of a ring?  What is going on, Bully?  Bully.  With microphones.  Why are you calling him Bully?  It's his name.  What's going on?  Shouldn't this be done backstage, in private?  You don't trust me, but you want to know what's going on.  Oh boy.  Am I hearing you right, Hulk?  I think yeah.  You haven't trusted me from day one.  What's with that blonde mustache and the black stubble beard? 
[02:44:00]  Like an idiot.  Every single week when I've earned it, and you know it.  And you won't trust the ad in a certain special pay-per-view here.  Now you want answers.  Cut the crap, Bully.  What's going on between you and my daughter, Brooke?  Whoa.  That's what we're talking about.  Whoa.  What's going on between me and Brooke? 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  Are you sure you want to know?  Answers?  Is that what you want?  Uh-oh.  You want answers?  Hulk, do you really want answers as to who the number one man is in your daughter's  life?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh my God.  How did the guy know to cue the music there?  Maybe, maybe Brooke told him to.  Ooh. 
[02:45:00]  Is that Brooke?  That's Brooke.  I do think she's sexy, man.  She is.  Where's he gone?  Is that her song playing?  Yeah, she sings her own entrance.  Oh, boy.  Here comes Brooke Hogan, obviously.  I really want to fuck her.  And it's Taz doing comedy.  She's a big gal.  Now.  Oh, she's juicy.  Oh, yeah.  She's pretty high.  Dude, I want to have the big long legs wrapped around you.  What in the hell is going on with you and Bully?  Uh-oh. 
[02:45:30]  Uh-oh.  I love him, Daddy.  What do you mean it's not what I think?  Let me tell you something, Brooke.  You married just yesterday.  As long as I'm on the face of this earth, I never want to see you with another wrestler,  especially him.  Aw.  Man.  She does look good.  Oh, man.  That's their CM Punk.  You're dirty.  You're dirty.  I'm telling you there, you're there.  I love him, Daddy.  I love him, Daddy.  I love him, Daddy.  I love him, Daddy.  What do you mean it's not what I think?  Let me tell you something, Brooke.  You married just yesterday.  As long as I'm on the face of this earth, I never want to see you with another wrestler, 
[02:46:00]  especially him.  Aw.  Man.  She does look good.  Aw, man.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Austin Ares.  He's got the same vibe as CM Punk, though.  Why is he standing on the table?  He's got the best that this company has to all work, and I've got better things to do.  He has the right height.  That's terrific.  Wow.  That's fantastic.  That's amazing stuff.  I can't wait to see what happens. 
[02:46:30]  Bubba Ray Dudley will be in to talk about that.  Damn, she is.  She turns me on.  She's sexy.  How tall is she?  Like, 5'11", 6'.  Yeah.  She's big.  A nice six-foot girl.  She's big, but it's shapely big.  I would die in that pussy.  I would literally wrap my arms under her back  while her big, beautiful legs were around me,  and I would just make cumzies.  I would make a weird...  I would put my face up by her neck chest  and go like...  By her neck chest.  See, because Hogan thought Bully Ray was in charge... 
[02:47:00]  It was associated with the Aces and Apes heel faction.  I don't know what that means.  Right, so now that Brooke Hogan is involved...  Oh, boy, now it's going to happen.  Who knows?  It's all fantastic.  Can't wait to talk to him about it.  You want to wrestle with something?  How about you wrestle with these tax problems?  What the hell's going on, guys?  Don't make a damn bit of sense to me.  Regular Joe is the worst.  But he is regular Joe.  Remember that guy I talked about yesterday  that I worked with when I was at Apollo Air Conditioning? 
[02:47:30]  Jeffrey Combson.  Yes.  I talked about how I looked at him and been like,  Oh, my God, I don't want to be that guy.  Because he was like 50 already,  and he was still doing it.  Right.  And I'm like, Oh, my God, I don't want to be that guy.  I got a text, a Twitter from somebody  that they work with him.  He's still doing it.  Still doing the...  Dude, he was 50 at the time.  Holy fuck.  That's like 20 years ago.  Yeah, so he's pushing 70 now.  Pushing 70 and he's still fucking...  Still there.  Well, that's what people do.  They actually work for a living. 
[02:48:00]  It's crazy.  They don't get to move on to a better job.  You'd think by that age, though,  you could fucking, you know, retire something.  Not anymore.  Oh, my God.  Not many people could retire at 65.  Poor fuck.  Should we take a break and get ready for Bully Dudley?  Bully Ray.  It's just Bully Ray.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  His last name is not Dudley anymore.  It sounds like you're saying Billy Ray  with a weird speech impediment.  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  Hey, it's Bully Ray.  It used to be Brother Ray.  Brother Ray, Brother Ray. 
[02:48:30]  But didn't Bubba Dudley Ray, Bubba Ray Dudley,  didn't he bring his name to Vince?  Yeah, but he brought it from ECW  and then Vince bought ECW all out.  So he bought all the ECW intellectual properties.  So not only he doesn't get the big stage anymore,  he takes his fucking name.  And he's still with ECW.  That's horrible.  There are old ECW guys  that never wrestle for Vince  that can't use their names.  Because Vince bought their names. 
[02:49:00]  Let it go, Vince.  Let it go.  He's an old man now.  My wife chalked up millions  with her failed political career.  I gotta pay for this.  I'm in debt up to my ass.  How much money did she spend?  Millions and millions of dollars  on her failed bid  to run the state of Connecticut.  Hey, can you run through some of the names?  Like, China can't use her name,  so what is she?  China, uh... 
[02:49:30]  She's Clint McGillicuddy.  She's China Doll.  China Doll.  Clint McGillicuddy.  Sorry.  Well, she had the spelling  C-H-Y, right?  In W-W-F?  Yes.  And she uses now  the regular, like, Chinese.  What are some of the other names  that...  And what do they change to?  Uh, let me see.  Some of the big ones.  Oh, man.  Well, like, Mr. Kennedy.  Right.  Now just has to go by his real name.  Jell-O brains.  It's not that. 
[02:50:00]  He keeps the gimmick,  but now he's just Mr. Anderson.  He's Puddin' Dumb Johnson.  D-Von Dudley became Brother D-Von.  Oh, jeez.  All right, so he sort of worked it.  But not D-Von.  D-Von.  Oh, D-Von.  D-Von.  D-Von was not his name anymore.  Oh, God.  That's D-E-V-O-N.  Funny when Otto said  he had a beautiful skull  that they demolished.  Demolished.  Oh, yeah.  The Kennedy's beautiful skull  that they demolished. 
[02:50:30]  Demolished.  Great fucking word.  Balls Mahoney had to wrestle as  Balls Mahoney?  You don't know Balls Mahoney?  No.  I've never heard of Balls Mahoney.  Well, you know what he had to wrestle as?  Huh?  Cajonies.  He lost Balls Mahoney?  Cajonies Mahoney?  Vince McMahon took Balls Mahoney.  He took Balls Mahoney.  Cajonies Mahoney?  Balls Mahoney's mine.  Oh, that's low.  I'm keeping Balls Mahoney.  He wouldn't let Balls Mahoney  have his name.  No, he wouldn't let...  That's all Balls had left. 
[02:51:00]  You never know  when you're going to need  a Balls Mahoney.  So now he's just  called himself Cajonies?  Balls Mahoney was from  Nutley, New Jersey.  Hilarious.  It's a big Balls joke.  He took it.  Vince took it for himself.  Vince, you suck.  You really suck.  Now it's just Cajonies.  If Balls Mahoney  ever sees the light of day,  it's coming out of my mouth.  Wait a minute, Vince.  Balls Mahoney.  Poor Balls Mahoney.  That's correct.  Who else got fucked? 
[02:51:30]  What about Ass Man?  Yeah, yeah.  He couldn't even use Billy Gunn.  Oh, my God.  Because it wasn't really  his real name.  What did he wind up using?  He couldn't be...  He couldn't be...  It was Kip James, I think.  Yeah, he couldn't just  call it Kip James.  Kip James!  It was Heine Guy,  they called him.  Heine Guy.  But he still wore  little shorts,  and he kind of had music  that sounded like  it was the tune of  Ass Man.  Because I'm a  Heine Guy. 
[02:52:00]  Because I'm a Heine Guy.  And then it's  different things he loves.  I love to wave them on.  I love to tickle them.  Oh, no,  I think he does tickle them, right?  Or he just sings,  I'm a Greek.  I love to kick them.  I love to shove them.  What a great song this is.  I love to stick them.  Yeah.  Second verse, too,  because it was so good.  I love to watch them.  This is better than entry music.  This is a good tune.  Yeah.  Why? 
[02:52:30]  Because I'm an Ass Man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm an Ass Man.  Yeah, right.  Because I'm an Ass Man.  He couldn't even use  Billy Gunn.  No.  He used to run in that ring,  spin around,  jump on the rope,  show his ass.  How humiliating  that he can't use  Billy Gunn anymore.  He can't use Billy Gunn.  And Paul's Mahoney.  What the fuck?  You mean cojones.  Now he's just cojones.  He's...  E-Rock,  you got any more examples?  Oh.  Some of those big names  that were taken away?  I do, 
[02:53:00]  but I'm not telling.  I mean,  Road Dog couldn't be  the Road Dog.  Remember the Road Dog?  Oh, my God.  I remember the Road Dog.  Of course the Road Dog.  What is he now?  He just became B.G. James.  But people would watch  and go,  who's B.G. James?  I don't know.  Right.  If I knew the Road Dog.  And he so wants  to be the Road Dog.  Why couldn't he be  like the Street Hound?  Wouldn't that work?  He still wanted to just  come out and go,  oh, you didn't know?  But he couldn't.  And Vince basically  lives in a castle  and he's holding  Balls Mahoney's name.  Balls Mahoney.  What a dick.  He's got Balls Mahoney  in the palm of his hand. 
[02:53:30]  This is a dick.  Like so many nickels and dimes.  And some of the divas  left too,  so they had to switch  their names.  Like what?  You got one?  Her name was  Victoria in WWE.  I'm trying to remember  what her name is.  X-Pac has had to put  every word that you can think of  in front of Pac  has been there  except X.  He's tried everything else?  Has he been Y-Pac?  He was 6-Pac at one point.  6-Pac?  He can't be X-Pac.  Oh, God.  Or the one,  he can't be the kid.  He can't be the kid?  He basically,  ah, it's terrible. 
[02:54:00]  He basically lives  in a trailer  and he can't even  use X-Pac.  How could he use  the word Pac?  I don't know if he lives  in a trailer, but  even.  Can you use  2-Pac is what it's based on?  Can you use X-Pac  or X-Pac with E-X?  No.  Oh, Christ.  Hockey-Pac.  Hot-Pac.  Yeah, Magic just has  a horrible...  It's really bad, yeah.  Hot-Pac.  Hot-Pac.  And now Vince,  when he signs people,  like, there are wrestlers  now who wrestle  under their  quote-unquote  real names.  It's not a wrestling name. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  But Vince won't allow  people to wrestle  with their actual  real names.  Right.  He makes them change  to a different real name.  That way, if they leave,  they have to wrestle  under their real,  real name  and nobody knows  who they are.  He's fucking amazing.  He really is a dick.  So, like, he signed a guy...  He kind of had that  feeling years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty evident now.  So, CM Punk,  Vince McMahon owns that name.  No, CM Punk was the last  guy to keep his own name.  Wow.  So CM Punk could leave  and have his name.  Yeah, he created it.  I'll get it. 
[02:55:00]  And the Miz created his own name.  I'll get it.  But CM Punk,  the Miz,  and MVP,  you remember him.  The Miz sounds stupid  because it sounds like  he's in Japan.  Like Miz.  Like,  like Miz.  What's up, Miz?  Yeah, yeah.  The Miz.  Sounds terrible.  Hey, Miz.  Hey, Hidden Miz.  Yeah, well, that too.  All these crazy names.  How about just  Joe Bagadonis?  That's what you call me.  Don't make a damn bit  of sense to me, guys.  He's the worst.  We gotta break.  Oh, God.  Because we gotta get, 
[02:55:30]  what's his name now?  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  And we like Bully Ray.  We go back with him.  He's a main eventer in TNA.  It's Bubba Ray Dudley.  It's Bubba Ray.  Oh, don't say that.  It's Bubba Ray fucking Dudley.  How's this for an injunction?  A C&D on you, Opie.  Don't call him that.  I own Bubba Ray Dudley.  No chance of keeping your name.  No chance in hell.  Yeah.  I would understand  if it was an up-and-coming business,  but...  Holy fuck, Vince. 
[02:56:00]  Let some of this go.  Not only is he not allowing...  He didn't even create these names,  and he's not allowing you  to keep them.  I know.  I know.  It's amazing.  That's kind of sad.  That would be great  if one of them found a loophole  where they actually owned Vince's name  and make him change it  to, like, fucking Lance McClain.  Lance McClain.  Just something he could use  his real name.  But guess what?  If somebody has...  If Michael Cole,  the commentator,  ever moves on to something else...  Oh, my God.  He owns Michael Cole?  Michael Cole is not his name.  He cannot move on.  That's not his real name. 
[02:56:30]  No.  Vince just gives people fake names.  Yes.  So he can own them.  No, you gotta change that.  That's not a TV name.  We gotta change it  to something else.  Yeah, something I'll own.  And then he owns it.  What a prick.  He signed a guy named  Brian Daniels  and changed his name  to Daniel Bryan.  And now everybody knows  who Daniel Bryan is.  But if he leaves the company,  he can't wrestle  as Daniel Bryan.  Wow.  I'm getting mad.  Because I guess legally  he can't take your real name. 
[02:57:00]  No.  Like, if you wrestle  under your real name  and leave,  it's still your real name  so you can use it.  Exactly.  So he makes you change it.  Yes.  And then owns that name.  And then owns the name.  And I'm sure he makes you  famous under it.  And I'm sure he makes you  come up with a new name.  Yeah.  I can't be bothered.  Come up with stuff.  So then you have some creativity.  You come up with a cool,  fake second name.  And then he owns that.  And then he owns it.  Yeah.  I got a name.  What is it?  I want to be like  the Snow Plow.  All right.  Snow Plow it is. 
[02:57:30]  But it's mine.  What the hell happened?  That's my finishing move.  The Snow Plow.  I have, by the way,  the best wrestling name.  I will sell.  I will not give it away.  Oh, come on.  No, I'll say it  because I own it.  Oh, what is it?  Let's hear it.  I don't know.  Come on.  It's a good one.  Oh, I can't wait to hear it.  Get ready to go to break.  No, it's a good one.  I think this might be our out  before Bully Ray comes in.  Jimmy, a new wrestling name?  Yes, Jimmy.  I can't look at you.  Jeff Turtz. 
[02:58:00]  Jeff Turtz?  That's awful.  He can't even say it.  He's like, Jeff Turtz.  Jeff Turtz and his...  Like, you know how you get, like,  Greg the Hammer Valentine?  Yeah.  He's Jeff the Meanderer.  Turtz.  He meanders from the ring.  Jumping Jeff Turtz?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something good.  Jeff the Meanderer Turtz. 
[02:58:30]  Vince would go,  you can have that one.  Yeah, keep it.  Keep that one.  That sucks.  All right, Bully Ray Dudley next.  No, not Dudley.  No?  No, not Dudley.  Just Bully Ray?  Bully Ray.  Yes, his first name is Bully,  his last name is Ray.  I'm surprised he's allowed  to use Ray still.  Yeah, really?  Is Ray his real name?  No, but he says,  you can call me Ray.  And he's going to have to...  Jay, call me Ray Jay.  He's going to have to bring up  the time I puked in his limo, 
[02:59:00]  but I didn't puke in his limo.  Oh, right.  But he loves telling everyone  that I puked in his limo.  He came in as Bubba Ray Dudley,  and he was going back to Long Island.  That's where he's from.  And he gave me a ride in his limo.  That's nice.  But I had the side seat,  and I got very car sick.  And I puked on the side of...  on the service road.  Did you have to go...  Could you pull over?  No, it was about my stop.  I was able to hold it in.  I was getting picked up at that point.  And I fucking puked.  But I didn't puke in his limo. 
[02:59:30]  Fucking Jerry.  He's proud of himself.  The meanderer.  I'm just thinking of this finishing move.  What is it?  It's like he just kind of  slowly walks around you,  and he just kind of  grabs you quietly  and laxadaisically  and gently puts you down.  Yeah, gently on the mag.  As he whistles a happy tune.  He's meandering.  Yes.  And introducing...  This is...  Entry music is very just...  nonchalant.  Jeff Tertz.  It's a terrible name for an...  It's music. 
[03:00:00]  He just meanders down the ramp.  And then here it comes.  He just meanders down the ramp  looking around.  Oh, look.  I'm making my way to the ring.  He's meandering.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  He's meandering around the ring.  He's terrible on the mic.  Oh, yeah.  He's like,  what is your problem?  I don't know.  Do you really want to talk about it?  He just kind of beats around the bush.  He's meandering around him, King.  I don't know what he's thinking. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my God.  He's got him in the meanderer.  Gently puts him on the map.  And his music is so bad.  You don't think that's a good name?  No.  That's horrible.  Terrible.  Especially if his real name  is something like Striker Allen.  Oh, see?  That would be a good one.  That's his real name.  He changed it.  Yes.  Jeff, G-E-O-F-F.  Yeah, yeah.  Bop.  Bam.  He has a good boy's phone 
[03:01:00]  and his naughty boy's phone.  A naughty boy's phone  and his good boy's phone.  He's a good boy's phone  and his naughty boy's phone.  A naughty boy's phone  and his good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone and it's a lucky boy's phone 
[03:01:30]  A lucky boy's phone and it's a good boy's phone  A good boy's phone and it's a lucky boy's phone  And it's a lucky boy's phone and it's a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky  Get ready, America. Today's hottest impressionist is coming to a theater near you. 
[03:02:00]  Jim Norton, Man of a Thousand Voices, live, in concert.  All your favorite celebrities are here.  Bill Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  Samuel L. Jackson.  That girl got snakes near a plane.  Sylvester Stallone.  Baby, I'm going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town. 
[03:02:30]  And Christopher Walken.  Oh, I carried this iPhone in my butt.  Jim Norton, Man of a Thousand Voices, live, in concert, coming to a theater near you.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  All right, so we got Bubba Ray Dudley. 
[03:03:00]  He's a block or two away, right, Sam?  Sam Roberts?  We have inclement weather around the New York metropolitan area.  I'll tell you this much.  Vince McMahon does not own Opie and Anthony.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  So I'm going to call him Bubba Ray Dudley, because that's how we know him.  Imagine if he did own Opie and Anthony because of that stupid XFL show.  XFL thing he does.  We find out he owns Opie and Anthony.  Maybe he does.  Your ass is mine. 
[03:03:30]  You didn't read your contract, did you?  It was on page 82!  I forgot.  I didn't even tell you guys what the Dudley boys, because they went to TNA as a tag team.  Right.  But they could not be called the Dudley boys.  So I'm sure it was something close.  Yeah.  They were team 3D.  Oh, my God.  What does that mean?  Get Vince on the phone.  What does that mean?  Get Vince on the phone.  We've got to stick up for these guys.  Well, because their finishing move was the 3D, the Dudley death drop.  Oh.  But they also couldn't say Dudley death. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, my God.  They couldn't say Dudley anymore.  So it's just...  But these guys, you know, after Vince is done with a lot of these wrestlers, they're broken.  So the least you could do is give them their stupid name.  Couldn't you make a name Dudley?  Like, your name is Dud?  And your last name's Lee?  Yeah.  I'm Dudley.  I guess so, but then you'd just have to be Dudley.  You couldn't be Bubba or Devon.  Well, it could be your middle name.  It could be...  Devon.  Bubba Dudley.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Devon Dudley. 
[03:04:30]  Dudley.  Yeah, it's Devon now.  Not Devon.  I mean, they still kind of pronounce it Devon.  Oh, boy.  I don't know why.  I'm really worked up about this.  I'm really mad for these guys.  Well, I mean, imagine creating a career for yourself.  You know, the limelight has passed him by.  But at least let him fucking go to a mall and sign some shit as X-Pac.  Yeah, I mean, technically they do, but they can't.  And they certainly can't even think about going on TV using those names.  That's sad. 
[03:05:00]  What about, like, Mick Foley?  Mankind and all that shit.  No, he always goes as Mick Foley now.  Because that's his name.  That's his real name.  All right, so he lucked out.  But he can't go in as Cactus Jack.  And even though he...  Dude Love...  Dude Love.  ...first appeared in a video he made when he was 17.  Oh, my God.  And Vince owns Dude Love.  He owns Dude Love.  Yeah.  Mine.  Mine now.  Mine.  Dude Love, mine.  It's a lunatic.  Bop, now it's mine. 
[03:05:30]  Bop.  All right, well, we had a terrific interview with...  Bubba.  Bully.  Bully is his name.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  We had a good interview.  You didn't talk to him yet.  Oh, what are we...  Why not?  I flew all night.  I gotta go home.  Are your arms tired?  Oh, boy, are they tired.  I just couldn't get those arms, like, fucking comfortable.  Oh, that's terrible.  It's the worst.  Lay in there.  And I brought my own pillow this time.  Oh, Jimmy Norton style.  I brought my own pillow.  Jimmy Norton style. 
[03:06:00]  The trip to L.A. and back.  Jeez.  Yeah, that's a tough flight, man.  The plane was a little too tall.  What do you mean?  I don't like getting in tall planes anymore.  Tall plane?  This is kind of a Seinfeld thing.  A tall plane?  Yeah, you don't have to...  This plane, I didn't have to duck down.  And you didn't like that?  No, because that says old to me.  Really?  Yeah, the tall planes.  You know what I mean?  Not like that aerodynamic kind of...  The ceiling's a little too high. 
[03:06:30]  Squished down kind of plane, you like?  I just want it squished down slightly.  Then I know that there...  And there wasn't a lot of curbs.  Right, because...  That scares me.  It was more boxy.  I'm like, that means this is an old fucking plane.  Because in 2013, we're thinking space economics.  Right.  You know, what's the best...  Well...  I'm not saying we have to bend down the entire time you're on a plane, but when I was walking  on the plane, I'm like, this plane's a little too tall.  Would you rather be on a 787, one of those new ones that fucking they're grounding in  Japan?  Those fucking things.  Brand new. 
[03:07:00]  They just...  I guess there's smoke coming out of everything.  Oh, really?  Batteries that are kind of overheating.  Yeah, because there's too much shit in there.  A lot of shit in there.  Is that the new planes that they brag about on every flight, but we haven't seen them  yet?  I haven't seen them.  Yeah, I guess they had an emergency landing in Japan.  How about you roll those things out?  And why are they flying in Japan and not America yet?  I don't know.  There it is.  That's the big 787.  Emergency landing.  How the fuck did they get that in the air?  It's pretty cool.  It's like the Titanic.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  You unveil your new shit, but that shit's not that great.  And that shit goes, ah, ah, fuck.  That's pretty cool, though.  And I guess all that modern shit inside is just kind of getting a little hot, hot under  the collar.  People had to slide down the little slide things there.  Yeah, they had smoke in the cabin and the cockpit and emergency landing, and then they  did the little slides down there.  He's in traffic.  That's got to be a bitch, because you know how long it probably takes for them to go over  all that shit in that plane and take those slides off and repackage them?  Ugh.  Probably that plane's out of service for a little while. 
[03:08:00]  Is that the Dreamliner?  Yeah.  They're having some trouble.  You know that they brag about, but we haven't seen one yet?  They've been talking about those dumb Dreamliners for, I don't know, well over a year now.  What pieces of shit those planes are.  Yeah, that's what we were just saying.  They're overheating, and the batteries are overheating, and the wiring is, uh, things  are, they had smoke in the cabin and the cockpit, and they had an emergency landing.  Oh, by the way, we had to wait for our spot this morning, too.  What is that about?  What do you mean?  On the runway?  After a six-hour flight, now you're just sitting there waiting for someone to work that dumb, 
[03:08:30]  that dumb...  It's the worst.  Oh, the dumb little fucking jetway?  Yeah, the jetway.  I hate that.  We waited for about 15 minutes easily.  And I hate that.  After a six-hour flight, you're like, well, just pull in and let's get the fuck off this  thing.  Why do they do that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They have a skeleton crew?  Yeah.  That late?  Sometime.  That must be frightening to watch.  Jesus.  I just waited for a picture with Kevin Bacon, because he did East Street Radio.  Oh. 
[03:09:00]  Did it happen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He works out in our gym.  Oh, does he?  He might have a locker very close to you.  Oh, I've never seen him there.  He's very close to your area.  This is what a fucking zero I am.  I mean, I really am a zero.  You didn't say, I'm Jim Norton, did you?  No, um, but he was at one of my shows at the LA Improv that I headlined.  No, he wasn't.  Yeah.  I headlined at a great set, and someone said, yeah, Kevin Bacon's here.  So on the way out, he was running out with a friend.  I just said, uh, I said hello to him.  And he goes, oh, hey, man, you're really funny. 
[03:09:30]  And he just walked in, and they were going.  But I just saw him out here.  No, he didn't recognize me at all.  Oh, no.  But we got the picture.  I go, uh, hey, I met you in LA.  Just now?  Yeah.  I said, uh, so he didn't recognize me at all, and then I said, uh, hey, man, I met  you in LA.  You were at my show at the Improv, and he didn't even respond.  But he wasn't being a dick.  He really, I know the energy.  Didn't know.  I literally could have said, no, but he didn't even, like, kind of register what I said.  Like, I literally could have said, like, yeah, I kind of like milk in my coffee.  And he's like, okay, man.  Like, it meant nothing. 
[03:10:00]  You should have brought a tomato with you and went, bacon, lettuce, tomato.  What the fuck are you going?  I would have cracked up.  I never would have got that out, you cocksucko.  Come from bacon.  I should have said, yeah, what do you got, mayo on your fucking backside?  Oh, my God.  He's probably heard them all.  But, I mean, literally, when someone is at your show.  Yeah.  I didn't want to, I just wanted, like, oh, hey, man, good to see you.  Right, right.  You entertained that guy.  He didn't even fake it.  You made him laugh, I guarantee you. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't even know if you heard what I said.  But, again, he really was not being.  Was he a hi or something?  I know what that's like when you're thinking of the next thing you got to do, and someone  just goes, oh, hey, man, I'm a big fan.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, okay, cool.  He wasn't being, I know when someone's being a complete asshole.  Jim's just being coy.  Let me put it out there.  Jim thinks Kevin Bacon's a fucking asshole.  No, he was nice.  Yeah.  He was actually very nice.  He was happy to take the picture.  No, he doesn't sound nice.  That means fuck him.  Fuck Kevin Bacon.  I can't stand Kevin Bacon.  And that's stupid.  Oh, we understand, Jim.  That's stupid game people play.  Let me see the picture.  All right?  That's right.  The picture's on my camera.  Oh, it's on your camera? 
[03:11:00]  Let me see.  Jim Norton knows.  Jim Norton knows rudeness.  And, no, I'm not going to say he was being a dick at all.  We're saying it.  It literally is.  We have nothing to lose.  It's my lack of importance.  And the Bacon Brothers, as a music act, stinks.  Whoa.  Thank you.  They're not a great band.  No.  He looks great.  And, uh, oh.  Yeah, he took a great picture.  He's a tall guy.  He was not a dick.  Getty was finished with him, and he walked away, and they go, could you do one more?  He's like, eh.  Whatever.  Footloose is a goofy-ass movie.  That's fucking right.  That footloose.  Who would believe that? 
[03:11:30]  It doesn't make any sense.  Out of all the things you want to do in your town, you want to dance?  Who gives a fuck?  I like when he angry dances.  Oh, man, and I'm dancing.  I'm angry dancing.  I'm running and flipping, and I'm angry.  I really could not be a bigger non-factor in this business.  Really?  Oh, no.  See, now that's what it does.  No, I'm not even...  Over a Kevin Bacon picture?  No.  No, no.  Honestly, no.  You're doing Leno tomorrow.  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  And you know what?  I'll ask Naomi Watts for a picture, and she'll probably take it.  She won't have any idea who the fuck I am.  Well, maybe next time you'll say Naomi Watts to know who you are, though. 
[03:12:00]  Who cares?  It's not that I need her to know, because I really don't give a shit.  It's more when you're doing things in the business that are, like, relevant.  People just kind of, oh, okay, you know.  Utterly.  It's amazing to me sometimes.  Amazing to me.  And then all of a sudden...  It clicks, Jimmy.  You've got to put this time in.  Yeah, I understand.  It's terrible.  I'm going to continue to do so.  It's terrible.  Are you really?  Yeah.  I say fuck it.  Believe me, I thought of it. 
[03:12:30]  Give up?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  What else would I do?  The job is great.  Yeah.  You've got to just foot loose.  Foot loose.  But that's why when people say...  Nice.  Come on.  Here you go, Jim.  This will make you happy, Jim.  Just angry dance.  When you get mad at stuff, just angry dance.  Throw those hips to the side.  Yeah.  When people say to me, why don't you just talk to them?  Yeah.  Why do you got to get a picture?  That's why.  Because real interactions are non-existent. 
[03:13:00]  I had an interaction with Joe Pesci this morning.  Yeah.  It happens.  Right before he told you he's not taking a picture with you.  No, but you're saying that...  No, I had to read his ticket form and tell him where he's sitting.  Meaning we're not even a blip on these people's radars, so why would I pretend that I am?  Yeah.  I know my place.  He's so angry.  That's okay.  Yeah, he is angry dancing.  Oh, he's angry.  Do you like that part?  Ugh.  I cannot stand...  You handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  Yeah.  He's fucking great.  That was a good one.  I would have had my fucking JFK with me if I would have known. 
[03:13:30]  Talk.  That would have been...  Oh, right.  Yeah, why didn't you get that sign?  Because he's not on the list.  He came in just to do Howard and Eastie Radio.  He's not on the list.  Believe me, I would have.  Why don't we get the Kevin Bacon?  He's a Howard guy.  They've been friends for a while.  Same reason we didn't get Tom Arnold.  Didn't we try for Tom Arnold and he's canceled everybody else?  I thought we were supposed to get Tom Arnold.  He canceled everyone except for Howard Stern.  Huh.  Oh, then fuck Tom Arnold.  You know, I'll fuck you, Tom Arnold, who has retweeted my shit over the last year or so.  Go fuck yourself, Tom Arnold.  Unless...  Let's get the word out.  Unless you got some retweets. 
[03:14:00]  Fuck him!  He did retweet you.  Well, yeah, I don't need any more retweets from Tom Arnold.  Whoa.  They only gave me a couple followers, so fuck him.  And his Twitter.  Bubba parked it.  I mean, Bully parked his car.  Well, have fun with him.  I gotta go home.  I gotta see my dad.  I got a show to do.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a show to do.  Yeah, so you do your 10 o'clock interview.  Well, you have a 10 o'clock interview with him.  Correct.  Right?  Okay, do that.  If you get any real nuggets, we'll play them on our show.  We'll play that bitch tomorrow.  Do you want audio of, like, Snooki talking about the graphic details of her pregnancy? 
[03:14:30]  Like, getting her vagina stitched up and trying not to shit?  Yeah.  I got that for you.  Did you play it on any one of your shows yet?  No, not yet.  All right, you fucking debut it on our shit.  Okay, I'll debut it on your shit.  And then you play it on your shit.  But I only give you a couple clips, and then, oh, you want the full interview, you gotta listen to my shit.  When I heard, I was pissed.  That's not how this is supposed to work.  I think so.  When I heard the fucking first interview with an amazing screenwriter on the after show, I was beside myself again. 
[03:15:00]  I'm just like, it was an amazing screenwriter, Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  And then I had to bring it to this program.  Yeah.  Well, that's what the after show does.  Compelling.  It's scoops.  Compelling.  I'm surprised that E-Rock's being vague.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  I don't know what to be that guy.  It's not like him.  Fucking vague rock.  Vague rock.  I like that.  You would have fit in perfectly with the Flintstones.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  She almost got hit. 
[03:15:30]  We're watching Footloose.  The music video.  When she's, like, standing up in the...  Oh, come on.  Everybody got footloose.  Footloose.  Oh.  Woo.  Angry dance.  So do we have a list of people we're saying fuck it to?  Fuck Tom Arnold.  Fuck Tom Arnold.  Fuck you.  Make sure we get that out there.  Fuck you.  You would have had a good time with us, too.  Fuck him.  Fuck Kevin Bacon.  You blew it.  Fuck Kevin Bacon.  Fuck you.  Fuck the Bacon Brothers.  Fuck your music.  Yeah.  Let's stop making believe that it's almost good. 
[03:16:00]  It stinks.  It's not even close.  Give me one Bacon Brothers song.  I don't know any, but I love Kevin Bacon.  I don't dig on swine.  I will not knock you.  He blew you off, Jimmy.  Fuck him.  No, he was not rude.  Believe me, I would love to blast him, but he was actually nice.  It had nothing to do with him being rude.  And nothing.  Bubba's checking in.  So you guys either got to end the show or bring him off for five minutes.  It's got to get very weird.  You're going to do it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Jimmy's got to do his show.  Jim is doing his show.  Jimbo's not going to fucking waste time on a guy that's late. 
[03:16:30]  I have an interview to do with the Blaze.  What about Bubba?  I would gladly interview Bubba, but I do have to do this.  I have to do this now!  My!  One more person to the fuck-o list.  Who?  Vince McMahon.  Oh, no.  Vince McMahon.  Not on my list, by the way.  I think Vince McMahon is a smart businessman.  I know.  You're hoping they're going to hire you.  You know they'll own Not Sam, though.  Maybe I'll give him Not Sam, but Not Sam Roberts.  That's my shit.  Maybe I'll give him Not Sam.  You hear that, Vince? 
[03:17:00]  If you want Not Sam, you know where to go to.  Look, let me do this.  If we don't end the show now, we're going to be stuck talking to him.  I know.  Let's get out of here.  You sure?  Yeah.  All right, Jim Norton's advice show is next.  Stay tuned.  And then Jimmy flies to L.A., and then he'll be back Friday, right?  Friday morning.  Very cool.  All right.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:17:30]  And you're a chance to speak directly with him.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Yay.  Yay.  You should call this the Mediocrity Hour.  Thank you for those of you that have decided to stay here and listen to this, this dreck 
[03:18:00]  advice from a guy who nobody recognizes.  I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  I'm just, it's kind of a realistic.  I've had a few things lately that have really showed me where I am in this business.  And it's fucking, and I know people go, oh, we love you.  I'm not fishing for compliments.  I'm not saying I'm terrible.  I'm bad.  But my new act is very funny.  I'm very happy with it.  I would love to shoot another hour soon.  I'm trying to push for Boston.  So I'm happy with that.  I'm not delusional.  Anyway.  Hey, Jim.  I'm just going to do a quick email. 
[03:18:30]  Enjoy your characters and comedy on O&A every day.  Like you, I enjoy a good rub and tug now and then.  But I'm paranoid about the legalities and potential diseases involved.  He's worried about getting arrested.  Please share your specific thoughts and experiences to help ease my tensions with these generally  pleasurable experiences.  Well, there's a couple of ways.  I mean, it is scary.  You never want to get busted.  They usually don't.  If they run in and bust people, I think that by the time when the cops are coming in, you're  going to hear it. 
[03:19:00]  You're going to hear the police coming in.  Sometimes starting a fire in a nearby building is also good because that will distract police.  They'll be there.  If you can do like an explosion, if there's like a nursery school.  I've set off a pipe bomb one time in a nursery school.  So while they were bringing out the injured children, I went and got jerked off next door.  And I don't know what you're worried about diseases, my friend.  I think you're a little paranoid.  What are you going to get on your dick?  Dish pan hands?  She's jerking you off.  You're not fucking her.  She's not sitting on your face.  She's not, you know, tinkling on you. 
[03:19:30]  So my surefire thing with disease, like a lot of times I'll fuck unprotected, is you  just got to go like, hey, look, you don't have AIDS or nothing, do you?  And then she'll usually say no.  Then you proceed.  Why would she lie?  If she says yes, then you got to make a decision.  I've had a few say yes, I do.  And I toughed it out.  All right.  Good luck, my friend.  Who's first?  Travis.  Travis.  Sam, by the way, is interviewing Billy Ray fucking Dudley, whatever his name is.  So it's Travis on the horn today. 
[03:20:00]  Let's go to Sonny.  I said on the horn, which is a phone.  I'm a dumb cunt.  Oh, Sonny from Dog Day Afternoon.  I want to rob a bank with my gay friend.  What do I do?  Almost close.  Hey, Jimmy.  Listen, you know, I just had 20 years of sobriety about two weeks ago.  And, you know, and then my wife kind of gave me the bombshell about two weeks later that she really wants a divorce.  This has been going on for like four or five years, and I've always kind of panicked at the sight of, like, wanting to go through a divorce. 
[03:20:30]  And I told her one of these days I was just going to fucking just say, you know, whatever.  And that was pretty much what I had done.  I pretty much at my wit's end with this whole thing, and I just said whatever.  The one thing, though, that I have lost is I lost the capacity to fucking jerk off now.  I just don't get hard ever since this whole thing.  I've been very nice to her and everything else, but just, like, my sexual drive has completely gone away for everything. 
[03:21:00]  My guess would be you're depressed, and a lot of times sexual drive goes away when we're depressed.  It might actually be healthy, like, to not want to jerk off when your wife is dropping a divorce bombshell might be a healthy response to it because you're kind of supposed to be sad when that happens.  Maybe that's a sign of good mental health that you're not languishing in fucking pornography with a constant – there'd be something wrong with you if you just had a fucking – you're just pounding your pud in between calls to the lawyer. 
[03:21:30]  I mean, it might be more healthy that you're just grieving and feeling sad instead of masking it by jerking off.  And I think going to a shitload of meetings is probably helping me out, too.  Yeah, I mean, anything – thank you, brother, and good luck, Sonny.  I hope you're okay, all right?  Thank you, sir.  Be good, buddy.  But I think that any time you're not masking it – you know, if this goes on for six months, all right, that's one thing.  But for a little while, maybe jerking off is not the right thing.  Maybe just feel the depression you're supposed to feel. 
[03:22:00]  So, it's good I should tell myself that.  Next.  Mike in New York City.  Welcome aboard, Mike.  Hey, Jimmy.  I have a problem.  Girls don't like me because of my voice.  Well, your voice sounds fine.  What's wrong with this voice?  We get disconnected.  Yeah.  Next.  Mark in Illinois.  Mark in.  Hi, Mark.  Hey, Jim.  How you doing, buddy?  I'm good.  How are you? 
[03:22:30]  Hey, I'm fine.  And, Jim, you know, I've been listening to you guys' show for a long time and consider you to be one of the funniest guys I've ever heard.  Thank you.  So, I would love for you to give me an opinion if you think this is funny or not.  There's a comedy club here, and everybody probably that has aspirations to be funny dreams of having their three minutes at the comedy club.  So, I'm going to try it on you, and if you think it's funny, I'll go to the comedy club.  If you don't, I'll go there and watch a comedian.  How's that sound?  All right.  How long has your bid?  Oh, it's really quick. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Here it is, man.  So, on Saturday night, I'm going to dinner with my wife.  And, as always, we're, you know, chit-chatting back and forth during that drive.  And I look over at this woman, and I think to myself, you know, this is a woman that I've been with for 17 years.  17 years.  She's raised our children to adulthood.  She's stood by me faithfully.  She has been everything to me. 
[03:23:30]  And in that moment, I realized something.  I'd really love to see her get fucked by a black guy.  Funny or not?  Well, you know, yes, I think that is funny.  I didn't laugh, but I was enjoying it.  A lot of times, I don't.  I'll enjoy it.  I would shorten the setup a little bit.  Like, no one cares if you're driving and chit-chatting.  You could just say, I was driving with my wife the other night.  I'm married 17 years, so I'm driving with my wife, or however you want to phrase that. 
[03:24:00]  And say, I just had this realization when I looked at, you know, the mother of my children about,  I just wanted to see her get fucked by a black guy.  Like, there's a way to get, I would get to that a little quicker.  But, yeah, go try it, man.  The fact that you could call a comic and just do that on the radio with no appropriate shame  shows me that you have the balls to at least try stand-up.  So go give it a shot.  Hey, man, thank you.  And I love your shit.  You're fucking funny as hell, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Good luck to you.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Doug?  Hello? 
[03:24:30]  Hello?  Hi, Doug.  Hi.  Hi, Jim.  Big fan.  Thank you.  I'm calling about something you were talking about on the O&A show at the end there.  You were talking about when you were with Kevin Bacon, you realized kind of how small and  weak your whole career was.  Yes.  That was something I've been experiencing a lot myself.  I have been transitioning from one career to another.  And I'm doing okay in my new career.  And I wasn't doing very good in my old career. 
[03:25:00]  And I basically gave up on my old career.  And I've been getting a lot of shit from people in my old career where they're like, you shouldn't  have given up.  You shouldn't have given up.  You should have stuck with it basically until the end, even though I wasn't making any money.  I had nothing.  And now I'm doing okay in my new career, but I keep getting told by everybody that I used  to work with that I've just given up.  Like, there's no amount, nothing I do for, like, ever now. 
[03:25:30]  Well, I'm just going to have given up, basically.  Well, you know what?  What was your old career?  What's your new career?  I was a lawyer, and now I'm a businessman.  Now I run the business.  You know what?  That's, you know what?  Who cares what they say?  If you're happy, if you made the switch and you're happy, fuck them.  Yeah.  I'm not really happy, though.  It was just about work.  You know?  It was like, I really wanted to be like a lawyer.  Like, everything I had been doing my whole life, everybody I know were lawyers.  It was a huge part of my life. 
[03:26:00]  It just became really obvious I was never going to make it.  It happens?  It happens, dude.  So, I mean, the only suggestion I could give you, you've already made the move.  It's just to accept the fact that, okay, it wasn't going to happen.  So, why fight something?  Like, if you say it's not going to happen because all these people around you are doing it, that's not why you should do it.  Especially if you weren't making money.  Like, I make enough money.  I'm not complaining about money.  I make a good living. 
[03:26:30]  You know, I know I'm in the right job, and I know that my career is good compared to some.  But I'm also very realistic about where I am.  But you made the right move if it wasn't happening for you.  Exactly.  But it's just, I've been surprised at how mean people have been about me giving up.  Like, it blew my mind.  Like, I assumed everybody would be like, well, you know, if you're not making it, whatever.  Life is what it is.  People have been really mad at me about this.  Fuck them.  Like, fuck them. 
[03:27:00]  All right.  Fuck them, dude.  Really.  You know you did the right thing.  Excuse me.  Fuck them.  If they're being mad at you because you made a decision that you needed to make, tough shit.  Who cares?  How old a guy are you?  I'm turning 30.  All right.  So.  And I've been at it for seven years.  You know.  You gave it a shot.  It wasn't going to happen.  You made the right move.  Well, you made a move.  And if you would have sat there for another 10 years, they would have said, why didn't  you change when you were 30? 
[03:27:30]  When you.  That's what.  I've been telling them, like, are they going to put food on my table?  Yeah.  None of them are giving me a job.  None of them are giving me referrals.  None of them give a fucking shit about me.  Right.  Fuck them.  It started driving me insane.  They're no different.  Thank you for the call, buddy.  No different from comedians.  Other comedians don't give a fuck.  You know, you think they do, but they don't.  They give a fuck about themselves.  It's like every job.  The same thing.  Who's next, Travis?  Uh, 917.  I don't have a name for you on the screen.  Why is there no name?  Hello? 
[03:28:00]  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  Uh, I love you, by the way.  Thank you, sir.  I just, yeah, I'm kind of stuck in the middle here, Jimmy, man.  I, uh, recently, man, like eight months ago, me and my wife split up.  And, uh, I would kind of raise my, all I do is work.  And then I raise my daughter at night, you know, vice versa.  My wife has the baby during the day.  But I used to be like a creative dude and, uh, I used to write music and whatever, all  kinds of crazy shit.  But now I'm like up 35 and I feel like I'm kind of like, I want to be creative, but I 
[03:28:30]  just feel like so fucking bogged down, man.  And I know plenty of dudes who are successful that have children.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's not an excuse, but you know, I just feel like, fuck, man.  Like, like the spare time that I do have, I'm just like so fucking exhausted, man.  You know what I mean?  And I don't know, like I've, I'm really fucking desperate to do something.  I'm not even for money, man.  I mean, cause it's like, that's not why I do things.  I never did things for money.  Right.  I mean, and, uh, just like I need that outlet, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, I, I understand being tired too.  I don't have any kids. 
[03:29:00]  So for me, it's a lot easier, but you got to find some kind of time to be a little  creative.  Otherwise you're going to go nuts.  Cause then it's just the kids and work and thinking of the wife leaving you.  So you ought to take all the energy or the, whether the shitty feelings you have from the  wife leaving or whatever they are and use that to be creative.  I find being unhappy makes me more creative than being happy.  People always tell me I'm funnier when I don't have a girlfriend because, um, you know,  I'm just, I'm, I'm in a state of kind of disarray and that's when my being creative seems to 
[03:29:30]  be sparked more when I'm happy and the status quo is the status quo.  I don't feel as driven to be creative.  So I find, and I don't make myself unhappy, but I just find that when things are unsure  or I don't know what's next, or I'm a little confused or I'm afraid, I almost had a scare  like a retard.  If I'm afraid, then, uh, that's when my creativity seems to work because being creative or being  funny kind of makes sense to me and that makes things okay.  So when do you need to make things okay when they're not? 
[03:30:00]  So I would suggest making a little bit of time because, uh, this is probably a good time  for you to be creative, right?  Absolutely, Jimmy, man.  Yeah, it's funny.  Like I used to, I'm not going to stay on the phone all day, but I was like bummed out in  the relationship.  Like now that the relationship's over, I'm kind of, we weren't in a good place anyway, so  I'm kind of all right with that.  You know what I mean?  But, uh, I actually used to call him the fucking into the show.  I'm racist Francesca guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  We loved your calls.  You were very funny, dude.  Uh, yeah, and it's funny because like I was real depressed at the time and then when I  was doing those calls, like I was still married and my wife would be like, you get so excited 
[03:30:30]  over this and like, you know, I wish you were more excited at home and you know, like,  I was just like, and then I guess that was like something I always thought about.  Like, fuck man, you know, like I should try, I want to try and do something else, but yeah,  it's just, it's like I said, man, it's just time, man.  It's all like, there's no fucking time.  It seems like there's just not enough hours in the day, you know?  You should have talked dirty to her like Francesca, that'd be great.  Hey, as Francesca, could you tell, tell you, I want to hear you say, I want, I, that you  want to give her a good ass eating as Francesca.  Okay. 
[03:31:00]  I, uh, I know we've, I've been getting along, okay, and, uh, that's fine, okay, but I want  to put your panties down and your ass from behind, okay?  I want to bend you over and stick my tongue deep in your shitter, okay?  Maybe you change your mind, okay?  You let me back in the house, okay?  At least give me my fucking DVDs back, okay?  All right, Jimmy, I love you, pal.  Thanks, man.  Feel better, all right, buddy?  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  That made me, I have to give my DVDs back.  Yes, uh, who is next?  Uh, Andy in Nebraska.  Hi, Andy.  Hi, Jimmy.  First of all, I think you fucking rule, bud. 
[03:31:30]  Thank you very much.  Your show on the 26th in San Diego, I have a granddaughter and grandson-in-law that are  both Marines at Camp Pendleton.  Nice.  They did nine and a half months tour in Afghanistan and they both survived.  Good.  And they're both going to be there to see you Saturday night.  Oh, good.  And I was hoping you could say hey to Sarah and J.R. 
[03:32:00]  Well, I signed stuff at the end of the show.  I'm basically a merchandise prostitute.  You could see me at the end of the show.  I'm usually wearing blackface and tap dancing by the door as people leave.  And I'm very accessible.  So if you want to put a bullet in me, you know where to do it.  Although, you know, Kenny is armed.  And I will be happy to say hi to them.  They just have to tell me who they are and I will be there.  Oh, okay.  I will do that.  And like I said, you fucking rule, bud.  Thanks a lot for the call, man.  Take care.  Yeah, bye. 
[03:32:30]  Goodbye.  Another call?  Yeah, of course.  Damien in Illinois.  Oh, Damien.  How are you?  I'm great, Jimmy.  How are you doing?  Don't make me beg you, Mark.  How many omen jokes have you heard in your life?  How old are you?  41.  Okay, so you're in my age group.  So you've heard probably plenty of Damien remarks.  I apologize.  Oh, yeah.  All through high school, I had long hair.  I tell people to hide it thick behind my ears.  Okay.  I can take you with me, Mark.  He was cast out.  That's all fucking the omen too, and they're in the fucking snow. 
[03:33:00]  What's on your mind, Damien?  Well, Jimmy, I want to invite you to a pro.  I got an idea.  I wanted to write a book, but I don't know the first thing about how to go about getting started.  Like, you know, getting, like, do I sell my rough draft together to find a publisher,  or do I find a publisher first, or I wanted to ask your advice on how to get started with that.  Well, the way it worked for me might be a little different, because I had stuff posted 
[03:33:30]  on my old website that a woman named Lydia Wills saw, who became my book agent at Simon  Tuesday.  I mean, she doesn't work for them, but she became, she's a very good book agent.  So she contacted my agent, so, you know, we knew some mutual people, and said, well,  Jim's a good writer.  Would he want to write a, and I was blogging while Opie and Anthony were off the air, so  it kind of backdoor came to me, because I had some material that was written already,  and she approached me, and by the time the book got done, you know, we were on the air 
[03:34:00]  and doing very well, and whatever.  So, as far as just kind of going from scratch, I don't know the answer to that.  I would suggest any rough draft you have, you want to clean up a little bit, you want  to probably present them with as good a product as you can, but somebody might say, no, no,  no, just make up a one sheet.  I really don't know.  You ought to call a fucking publisher.  Call someone in the book industry, because I don't want to steer you wrong.  So I apologize for not having the appropriate answer, but I kind of backed in, because I'm 
[03:34:30]  a comic, and it was just a weird way it came about for me.  Okay.  All right, so.  Well, that's more than I knew before I made the phone call.  I appreciate it, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  Keep writing.  I would suggest that.  Always keep writing, and I always tell people when you're writing, never stop yourself from  going off on fucking tangents.  Never go, oh, I was writing about the curdling of cheese.  That's my next book, by the way.  The process of cheese curdling from beginning to end. 
[03:35:00]  But then all of a sudden, you go off on a tangent, and you're like, oh, I got to get  back to this.  No.  When your brain is going left turn, motherfucker, it's because your brain sees something ahead.  So always allow it.  You'll come back.  All right, good luck, buddy.  All right.  And one thing I always talk to people about writing, too, is like, you want to mask sexual  flavors.  You can't mask a lack of writing, but you can mask sexual flavors.  You know, they're not always pleasant, let's be honest.  I would say the new way to foreplay, apparently there's this revolutionary intimacy enhancer 
[03:35:30]  that it's designed to help couples enrich their sex life, and it enriches your relationship.  These flavored gel strips, they dissolve on the tongue, and they block the tastes that,  let's be honest, are sometimes associated with oral sex on a man and his subsequent climax.  You all know, bleach breath.  No girl wants bleach breath.  This drastically improves the experience for both partners, because she doesn't have that  awful taste in her mouth, and you don't have to look at that fucking sad sack look on her 
[03:36:00]  face.  You don't have to look.  You ever watch a girl look down when she's blowing you?  I've seen happier faces at caskets.  This has been featured on the pages of Playboy magazine.  This product was developed through years of research and testing.  It's 100% safe and effective.  So if you want to find out more, visit sexualflavors.com to learn more.  You can read up on customer reviews, and of course, you can purchase individual use strips  and three-packs, if you're an optimist about a date.  Buy a three-pack, because she might not just want to blow you once. 
[03:36:30]  She might go, look, before dinner, I'm going to blow you in the car, and I'm going to blow  you in the bathroom, and I'm going to blow you out, but you drop me off.  But I don't like the taste of cum.  I hate your cum.  Then you go, hey, look what I got.  And you pull out that three-pack, and you wave it at her.  And now she has no excuse, so she has to blow you.  And they come in different flavors.  She might go, I don't like strawberry.  You go, well, I got some watermelon.  I don't like watermelon.  Well, I got some chocolate.  She goes, I'd only do it if you have mango. 
[03:37:00]  And then you show her mango.  And she's like, oh, nerds, now I got to suck it.  That's sexualflavors.com.  Mask sexual flavors.  The spark to reignite your bedroom flame if it is now a dud.  So maybe Sonny from Boston, who called, our pal Sonny, can put some of this.  Maybe that's the problem.  His hand doesn't like the taste of his cum.  So maybe if you put a mask sexual flavors thing in your palm, you'll regain an erection  and ejaculate all over your dumb Boston knuckles.  All right, who's next, Trevi? 
[03:37:30]  Cam in Minnesota.  Oh, Cam.  Cam do.  Oh, a little levity.  Hi, Cam.  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, it's a girl named Cam.  Is that short for Cammy?  No, well, it's actually Camelon.  Camilla?  Ugh.  Ugh.  No.  That's nice.  I'm only kidding.  Is that a combination of your parents, Carl and Pamela?  No, she probably was supposed to call it Camilla, and she read it wrong.  Oh, that's funny, Camilla. 
[03:38:00]  I think that's my mom issue.  Oh, God, Camilla Parker Bowles.  All right.  I'm way prettier than her, and I'm Asian, so it's different.  Oh, Cam, the Asian girl.  Yeah.  So maybe your first name is video.  Take this out.  All right, so Cam, do you have a nice hiney?  Because there's always that stereotype about Asian women, which I find on certain women  is true, and certain women is not true.  Actually, I do, because people think I'm, like, half black or Filipino or whatever.  I'm, like, a nondescript, another minority, so people don't know what I am. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, what nationality actually are you?  I'm half Vietnamese and half ill-billy, so.  Indonesian.  Wow.  That's the country I was trying to think of the other day, Indonesia.  And where do you live?  I'm sorry.  In Minnesota.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead, Cam.  I didn't mean to keep babbling about your hiney.  That's all right.  Many people do.  Good, good, good.  As they should.  So I have two things.  One thing, I think you're, like, one of the best interviewers, and I really enjoy when  you get to interview your questions for celebrities when you come on the Opie and Anthony show,  because I think you get into the details that get glossed over by others. 
[03:39:00]  I like how you think and how you get people to answer the questions.  Well, thank you.  Well, that's because, thank you very much, Cam, because that's why I'm doing a new show  now, an interview show.  It's called The Nitty Gritty with Jim Norton.  Thank you.  I love doing it.  I love just asking people questions.  And what else is on your mind?  So the second thing is, I like, sometimes I get involved being around celebrities, and  I get a little nervous.  So how do I get a picture with them, or to make a little interaction without being stalkerish 
[03:39:30]  or weird, or something creative where I can just do my little hook line on them?  Well, to be honest, if you have a hook line, you're going to be panicked and focused on  the hook line.  My greatest, the way I do it, is I'm honest in my approach.  I know that they probably will not know who I am.  So what I do is I just walk up and I go, hey, can I take a quick picture with you?  And then I say, thank you.  I love your stuff.  And I leave them alone.  I do the stuff that won't bother me if people do it. 
[03:40:00]  So I would suggest just, it's a little awkward at times, but if you just want a quick photo,  a lot of times they're happy with that, and they don't want to sit and talk to you for  10 minutes.  A hook line is just going to make you seem silly.  If you like their stuff, just say, hey, I really like your stuff.  I really enjoy what you do.  A quick hello, and I'd love to take a photo with you.  And then they'll say yes or no.  I would keep, be as honest and simple and to the point as you can.  But as a woman, you have a much better shot.  Or you could just go, hey, hey, look at my hiney. 
[03:40:30]  I would do that.  You want to take a picture with it?  Yeah, I would put my ass by them and go, you know, a lot of people think I'm half black.  Why don't you give it a feel?  Oh, that's a great opening line, because then they'll touch your ass and go, ah, you goose.  All right, Cam.  Well, I did that to Toby Keith once, so it worked.  I'm sure it did.  I wish you would do it to me, because I would gladly, not only would I touch your hiney,  but I'd give it a little probing.  I'd angrily push your jeans into your hiney hole with my finger.  And say, oh, it's got another 200 degrees left before it's done. 
[03:41:00]  That should be your line.  Use that one.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, Cam.  Maybe that's why women don't call my show, because they just call up with a genuine question,  and then halfway through, I'm fingering their assholes through fabric.  Boo, Jim.  Who's next?  Tom in Wisconsin.  Hi, Tom.  Hey, Jimmy.  How the hell are you, buddy?  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  Hey, I'm doing all right.  My wifey and I really are missing Patrice, I tell you.  And we got most of this stuff off of iTunes that was available, 
[03:41:30]  and both of us are kind of wondering if, you know,  maybe Vaughn or the family has anything else coming down the pipeline.  And we haven't taken the time to, you know,  Twitter or anything like that, but we just miss the guy.  I mean, some of my best memories so far of Patrice and you guys are when you guys  get into something where you have that genuine laugh,  like you just did with the Francisca guy, that guttural, genuine laugh.  I mean, Patrice was so awesome.  I mean, we had tickets to Chicago, and then, you know, that was unfulfilled, obviously. 
[03:42:00]  But we just miss the guy,  and we're wondering if there's more coming down the pipeline, Jim.  I don't know what Vaughn has.  I know our benefit for him.  We're doing a benefit in February at City Center.  It's sold out very quickly.  It's myself, Burr, of course, Colin, Bobby,  a bunch of guys that knew Patrice well.  I think Will Silvansky, Keith Robinson.  It's a really good show.  I know there's, besides Mr. P., of course, which you can get,  there was that other 20-minute thing on iTunes.  But, yeah, I miss him, too. 
[03:42:30]  I mean, there's literally not a day that goes by  that I don't think of Patrice, and I don't miss him.  I was thinking of him last night going to the Comedy Cellar.  I was just walking, thinking of Patrice,  and just what a void there is that he's gone.  And it's not one that will ever be filled.  You know, because...  Go ahead.  We'll see a big Dodge pickup, you know,  and, you know, remember the story he told about getting the truck stolen  and stuff like that.  And it's amazing how just a little thing can spark a memory of somebody 
[03:43:00]  that you just don't, I mean, that you've never even met.  It's just...  And I can only imagine having him as a friend  and some of the shenanigans that you guys went through.  It must have been fucking awesome, Jim.  Thank you for the call, buddy.  You're absolutely right.  Thank you very much.  Thanks.  Bye.  Be good, man.  And, yeah, tweet Vaughn and tell her that.  I'm sure she'll be happy to hear it at Big Mama Pruds.  You know what?  Because Bill Burr emailed me the other day.  Because we're doing...  He was just asking me something about Patrice's photos for something.  And so I was looking through my Patrice pictures, 
[03:43:30]  and I sent a couple.  And there was one of me and Patrice in Brazil  with a girl with her tits out.  And, you know, he's got his arm around her,  and I got my arm around her,  and I'm looking at her tits and with my dumb sunglasses.  And I was just thinking on the way to the cellar last night  about, like, that laugh that he had  when he would smile at you.  There was a very little boyish thing he would do  when you nailed him on something  where he would squinch.  He would kind of scrunch up his face 
[03:44:00]  and the big smile,  and he had, like, a little gap in his teeth.  And it was almost like a shy, like, ah.  And that was a very genuine Patrice.  That was the guy I loved very much.  I don't know, I'm babbling.  So who's next?  Brian in Michigan.  Hello, Brian.  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy?  Good, how are you?  Yeah, hopefully one of the days I'll catch you  if you're in the Detroit area, man.  Thank you.  I'd love to see you live, man.  I was curious about you, actually.  You have a CPAP machine.  You have CPAP in there. 
[03:44:30]  Apparently, I've heard over the broadcast.  Did you actually do a sleep study,  or did you just take the mask  and just go with it,  or did you actually go to a hospital  for a sleep study, by the chance?  I've done three sleep studies.  One in my house with, you know,  kind of a crass machine  that went over my nose.  That didn't give us the details,  so then I went in for a study,  and I wound up with a fucking CPAP, 
[03:45:00]  but I got an APAP, an auto one,  and it didn't work,  so I went back for another study,  and I have a BiPAP,  which does not work for me.  I know what I need,  and they won't fucking give it to me.  I don't care what the sleep study said  or the shitty text.  I know what I need.  It's called an ASV machine,  or is it AVS?  I always get confused.  Auto service, I can't even say it,  but I know I need it  because it cures complex apnea,  so I'm so fucking irritated.  Yeah, I'm actually surprised. 
[03:45:30]  I mean, all the trouble you've been having,  I had a sleep study years ago.  I have a sleep pad for my truck  I use when I sleep.  I get the full vein mask over my face, you know,  because that sleep study was horrible, too.  I got, like,  you have that freaking thing  that hook you up all those freaking wires  and everything else.  It's terrible, dude.  It's adjusting it  and wakes you up again,  and they say,  I started with a mask  that goes right in the nose,  but that didn't work  because I kind of keep it  with the mouth open,  and I just can't keep my mouth shut,  so they put the full face mask on. 
[03:46:00]  They come in multiple times.  I had to go use the bathroom,  and they say at the end of the night,  oh, you know,  you didn't really sleep very well.  No shit.  Yeah.  Up and waking and sleeping again,  but you got to change in the mask  or pulling, you know,  reconnecting a wire or something.  I was like,  but I was surprised.  There was a lot of trouble  you've been having this.  I mean,  the sleep study worked for me good.  I mean,  I love, you know,  I don't like the fact  that I have to use it,  but I mean,  it gives me, you know,  good sleep and everything.  Well, I'm a bad sleeper, dude.  Thank you for the call very much.  I'm a very bad sleeper. 
[03:46:30]  On a fucking $8,000 mattress,  I'm sure I would sleep bad,  much less with a mask on my face  and fucking jet exhaust  being shot into it,  and the mask is wrong.  I fucking will forever hate that tech  that wouldn't test me  on that one machine.  When I woke up halfway through  on the BiPAP,  I know what I need.  I have fucking complex apnea.  BiPAP,  I don't care what they say,  stinks for complex apnea.  It fucking stinks.  Because then when your brain  tells you to stop breathing,  it doesn't sense  that you've stopped breathing. 
[03:47:00]  It's all about oxygenating  your fucking,  your blood.  So I guess that they think  that by curing the fucking,  the one form of apnea,  it stops the other,  but it doesn't always work.  So fuck BiPAP.  866-969-1969,  if you have a question.  Why'd you go in there  and talk to EROC?  What happened?  I just wanted to make sure  that the phones were working.  Okay.  Yeah, there's only a couple lines  so that you will get through  if you call.  Very important question  from Mike in Indianapolis.  Sure.  Mike?  Yeah.  Yes?  Yes?  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  All right.  We're going to pass that one.  Yeah.  Brad in Mississippi.  Yes, Brad?  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  I'm good, Brad.  How are you?  Fantastic.  My question is  kind of more for you.  I mean,  I would like to call  a minute ago  when I was talking  about the trees.  How does it make you feel  or how do you deal  with the fact that  so many people  in the world,  you know,  for all you guys  on the show,  you know,  they love you  and they hurt  when you hurt  but you don't even know them.  I mean,  I remember a couple years ago  when Fancy had his heart attack 
[03:48:00]  and I was like,  beside myself  and I had to say,  wait a minute,  I don't even know the guy.  I mean,  how does that make you feel?  Well,  it feels good to know  that people  or at least care about you  as a human being  and it makes me feel good  for him  and for his mother  and of course for Vaughn  that people had such  an outpouring of love  for him  except for of course  not doing a tribute  on certain comedy networks  because why would you  for a comic genius like that  that every comedian respected.  It makes me feel  very good for him.  The only sad part 
[03:48:30]  or the bittersweet part  is that  he didn't get to see that.  You know,  41 is really young  and thank you for calling.  It's very,  very young  and you know,  I wish Patrice  would have known  how much people loved him.  Like I think we as friends,  we're actually oddly affectionate  with each other.  The dumb comics,  we're not shy about it.  You know what I mean?  It's not,  it's just comfortable for us.  I guess because when you're on stage  talking about,  you know,  everything, 
[03:49:00]  you're not afraid of looking  like a fucking homo  if you hug your friend.  Like,  you know,  it doesn't,  it doesn't even faze us.  So,  I think that he knew  his friends loved him  and I know he loved me.  It's not,  but it's like,  I don't think he understood  how much people out there  loved him  or how cared for he was  and I wish he could have seen  how devastated  so many people were  when he got sick.  Next.  James in Virginia.  Hello,  James.  Hey,  how's it going,  Jim?  I'm well,  thank you.  My question is,  do you think it's possible 
[03:49:30]  for someone  who's not in the industry  at all  to break into talk radio  these days  and if so,  how would they go about it?  Yeah,  absolutely  because podcasting  is so big  that what you can do  is do a podcast  and I think,  I don't know the process  because I have not done one  but you throw it up  on iTunes  and maybe you,  you know,  I don't know how you get people  to listen to it  if you put it online  or if you try to link up  with other podcasts  or you try to get,  I don't know how you get it  onto a network  but yes,  I think it's probably easier  now to broadcast 
[03:50:00]  even though regular radio  stinks.  Yeah.  Podcasts are a very real option  and it's probably easy  to get lost in the shuffle  because there's so many of them,  you know,  you got,  you know,  a million guys doing them  but it's also a way  to broadcast.  Years ago,  you had no way  to broadcast it.  You don't have to intern  to do a podcast.  You don't have to intern  to do that.  You can just do it.  Do it in your house,  get a good quality one,  maybe interview some people  you know who are interesting,  you know,  find a theme that's interesting  and you might, 
[03:50:30]  you know,  as they say,  catch fire.  So you wouldn't go about it  the traditional way  anymore,  you don't think?  No,  I haven't.  I mean,  again,  I lucked up into it  so I probably wouldn't suggest that  but you can do both.  They're not mutually exclusive.  You can do both.  Try it the traditional way  and do a podcast.  All right,  thanks.  Be good, buddy.  Good luck.  What's up, Travis?  You're smirking.  Rick in Texas,  I'm pretty sure,  wants to say  he has to take the sleep apnea test  for trucking  and he has a problem with it.  Sal,  who I'm assuming  is on our phones, 
[03:51:00]  wrote,  has to take the Steve Apneu test.  Well,  it's not Sal.  We're using a,  somebody from  Ron and Fez's show.  I want to know,  Rick in Texas,  what is the Steve Apneu test?  Rick in Texas.  Yes,  hi, Rick.  Hi, Jim.  Do you want to take  the Steve Apneu test?  No,  the sleep apnea test.  They want me to take it  for my physical  coming up next month.  And  the thing about it  is  they're trying to make it 
[03:51:30]  mandatory  for,  you know,  bad truck drivers,  you know.  but I'm on like,  I'm like on the,  on the edge  and it's up to the doctor's  discretion.  Wow.  And they ask me questions  like,  you know,  do you have trouble sleeping?  You know,  no.  They're like,  well,  you're in a truck,  you know,  and all this other stuff.  I'm like,  yeah,  I've been a trucker  for 14 years.  I've been doing team,  team expedited freight  for 14 years.  The only time,  the only problem  I have trouble sleeping  is when I'm at home  and my four-year-old  wakes me up at six  in the morning  by jumping on me, 
[03:52:00]  you know.  Well,  then you don't have to worry.  You know,  well,  they want me to take it.  The company's not going  to pay for it.  It's like 1,200 bucks  out of my own pocket  for them to tell me,  oh,  you don't have a problem sleeping.  But don't,  won't insurance cover that?  No.  Wow.  I'm surprised.  Wow,  that sucks.  No,  they're saying,  oh,  the insurance won't cover it.  You know,  you have to pay it  out of your own pocket.  And I've talked to the doctor.  I'm like,  look,  I don't have a problem sleeping.  If you give me  that fucking machine, 
[03:52:30]  the only thing I'm going to do  is use it to tie my 4-year-old  to keep me from waking me up  on my day off.  Yeah,  that's a silly thing.  I don't know what to tell you,  buddy.  Just because this is not  an apnea issue.  This is a doctor,  right,  or insurance issue.  Right.  I don't know what to tell you.  If you don't,  if you sleep well,  maybe it's mandatory  for truckers to be tested  because you guys could,  you know,  plow 80,000 pounds  into a carload of fucking  retarded children.  But I would just say,  you know,  look,  try to make your insurance cover.  Maybe go to the doctor. 
[03:53:00]  And say that you're waking up  gasping.  Oh,  but then again,  that would be admitting  you to sleep badly.  Hmm.  I don't know,  buddy.  I have never faced  that situation.  Yeah,  it just sucks.  I'm sorry to hear it.  Good luck,  brother.  Mike in New Jersey.  Oh,  good.  Mike.  Hey,  how's it going,  Jimmy?  Good,  buddy.  I got this problem,  man.  I'm trying to have anal sex  with my lady,  right?  We've been together  for about a year now.  I enjoy drilling for that  Iraqi crew from time to time,  but she's not down to do it.  So I've been eyeing up  the butthole when we do a doggy  and I'm wondering,  should I just pro harbor it 
[03:53:30]  or continue to try to manipulate  her into doing it verbally?  What I would do  is hold her hips really tight  and backstroke kind of far  and push it in.  Right.  And then,  you know,  and I'm doing air quotes,  accidentally pull it out  and jam it balls deep  where the duty comes out  and then you go,  whoops-a-daisy!  And you say,  you say whoops-a-daisy  so loud that you get  spittle on her back  and then you see 
[03:54:00]  how she handles it.  Pray to God  there's not a piece of corn  on the tip of it  like one of those  Peruvian hats they wear.  Well,  just as they say,  it's always better to ask  for forgiveness  than permission.  You know,  so I would just,  I would just fucking,  I would just get in there  and take what's rightfully yours  as the husband.  Absolutely.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  Of course, I'm kidding.  Bye-bye.  I would gently,  just gently probe your penis in  or you could do this here.  Gently,  like lube your,  lick her ass a little bit  and lube it up  or sometimes if you'd all just, 
[03:54:30]  you know,  put the one finger  over the other nostril  and snot down on it  and then just rub your penis  against her anus  and just probe in gently  and do baby talk  and go,  oh,  look at this.  Oh,  look at the little thing  tightening up.  We're going to go inside.  You know,  just do that  and see if she relaxes  and laughs.  Good luck.  Yes.  Eric in New York.  Hi, Eric.  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Cool.  I was expecting an idiot  to be on the phone.  I'm not,  I'm not more of a little beast. 
[03:55:00]  Screenplay question.  So,  listen,  with your,  you're always talking about  trying to stay in shape  and working out and whatnot  and I know you have a huge interest  in the UFC.  I was wondering,  because I just started myself,  if you've ever thought about  training in like Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Yeah,  but I'll be honest,  just to,  you know,  just to get in shape  and to learn a little bit,  sure,  because it's hard not to  when you're around those guys  so much,  want to learn something about it.  But I never have aches.  The apnea,  it kills me so much.  I'm so fucking tired,  like,  it's such an exhaustion  that I,  when I go to the gym,  I am literally,  I feel like I'm stoned 
[03:55:30]  and I will make myself do an hour.  But it's not just,  I'm tired  because I didn't work out.  I worked out too much yesterday.  If that exhaustion was taken care of,  I might do it.  But as of now,  I would not do it.  I'm just happy  I've been going to the gym.  I'm happy.  Even with my bad elbow,  I've been making myself do fucking cardio  and sit up.  So I'm not going to fuck with it  and do something  that could push me away from it.  Oh, okay.  Because it's great for,  like,  I'm 37  and I just started  and it's great  because it's a real slow art.  You're not,  you know,  punching things and stuff. 
[03:56:00]  So it's just,  it's good in that way.  Yeah,  I wouldn't mind.  I mean,  it would be nice by the time I'm 60  to be able to defend somebody  if they try to finger my girlfriend  at the diner counter.  Well,  you know,  Ed O'Neill,  Al Bundy,  he got his black belt at 60.  Who did?  Ed O'Neill.  Oh,  good for him.  Yep,  yep.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm sorry to cut you off.  Sorry.  That was Travis's  utter incompetence and anger.  Brian in Jersey.  Hello,  Bri.  Hey,  Jim,  how you doing?  Good talking to you,  buddy.  Forgive me for my forced familiarity 
[03:56:30]  by calling you Bri.  You may hate that.  What's going on?  Hey,  not much.  Hey,  got a question for you.  Sure.  Been married for 14 years.  Okay.  I met somebody about three weeks ago  at a cocktail party  that happens to be married to  and we've hit it off  and have been talking every day  and sneaking around  seeing each other  but I need some good excuses  of how I can get out of my house  and what I can do  to keep this thing going.  Have you fucked this girl yet?  Not yet, 
[03:57:00]  but I could at any moment  if I wanted to.  You might want to avoid that.  I mean,  believe me,  I'm not a sanctity of marriage guy  but you may be making  a tremendous headache for yourself  and devastating your wife.  It's like if you're married,  I'm not saying,  why don't you just divorce her?  I mean,  I know it's really easy for me  to say sitting here  but you're not asking me that.  You're asking me excuses.  I don't know.  I mean,  maybe tell her that you're going to go out.  Because I've never been the kind of guy  like go out to the bars  and do stuff on Friday, 
[03:57:30]  Saturday,  you know what I mean?  I got a kid at home,  you know,  and that's,  you know,  I'm not one to normally  just up and leave out of the house  on weekends  or do anything  so that's been my problem  trying to figure out  how we can do this.  Why don't you tell her  that you and your friend,  say you had a new friend,  Jeff just moved into town  and he likes to fish at night.  So you're going to,  at least that will explain your fingers  when you get home.  So say you're going to just go out  fishing with Jeff.  There you go.  Me and Jeff are going to go fishing. 
[03:58:00]  I'm going to go trouting with Jeff  or say something like,  you know,  maybe say you're going to go  to the library  on a Friday night.  Say, you know,  I want to go,  we're going book clubbing  where we go from library  to library  and we read a chapter  out of each book.  I'm going to go read  Huck Finn at the library.  That's a good excuse.  So you and Jeff are fishing  or Huck Finn at the library.  Sounds good.  Hey,  actually me and my new friend  will be coming to seeing  Ed's Bergada in February.  All right,  good luck.  We checked it out  at jimnorton.com. 
[03:58:30]  All right,  thank you.  Thanks, Jim.  Good, good.  Those are all dates from 1991,  by the way,  on that side.  Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Hi, Jeff.  Yeah,  Jimmy,  this is Jeff the Meanderer.  Hi, Jeff.  Jeff turts.  I love you.  Basically,  going back to Patrice  for just for a second,  you know,  you guys,  I mean,  Patrice squeezed a lot of life  into that 41 years  and,  you know,  it's just,  it's weird how,  you know,  people like him 
[03:59:00]  and Andy Kaufman  will,  you know,  squeeze so much life  into the short time  that they have,  you know,  not that they know it,  but it's just weird  how it works out.  I mean,  you know,  for me,  when you hit him  with that Bobo game  and he screamed like that,  that was one of the greatest  sounds I've ever heard.  Yeah.  You know,  so,  you know,  to me,  that was just comedy gold  and,  you know,  what was really eerie  was him singing  that Howlin' Wolf song  and every time I hear that  I'm going down,  you know,  he sings that.  I can't hear it anymore  without hearing him sing it. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah,  I wasn't here for that,  but with Warren Haynes,  I am aware of that  and,  yeah,  I couldn't watch it now.  It's hard for me to watch.  Some fan did a great documentary.  It's obviously an amateur documentary,  but it's on YouTube  and I watched half of it  because I was just in the airport.  I had to board the plane,  but it was very good  and I realized  that I watched very little  of Patrice's stand-up  over the years  because I just didn't watch  other comedians,  so I'm watching  some of his stuff now  and go,  oh God,  is that funny?  But I just didn't watch it coming up  because,  first of all,  if he's on stage killing,  you don't want to watch 
[04:00:00]  when you've got to go on after him.  I can't imagine him going through  airport security  with those suitcases  full of those dildos.  Oh, yeah.  I went through it with him.  Believe me,  he did.  That's the stuff  movies are made out of.  But really quick,  I know you've got a plane  to catch today  and I hope you have a safe trip.  Thank you.  And I look forward to you so much.  You're one of the,  you know,  you and ONA  are one of the things  I look forward to every day.  But I'm just,  you know,  you and Bobby  were actually  hitting on it  a couple days ago.  But if, 
[04:00:30]  God forbid,  if entertainment shut down  and you couldn't do stand-up  and you couldn't do ONA anymore,  what would you do?  You know,  I know you guys were talking about it.  You sort of shied away from it.  I don't know.  I mean,  I can't imagine  any other job  that would make me feel good.  I can't imagine  any other thing  besides entertainment  that I could do.  I can't picture myself  doing anything else.  So,  when I was a kid,  I wanted to be a lawyer  and thank you for your call.  I appreciate it, man.  I wanted to be a lawyer  but I cannot think of 
[04:01:00]  one other job.  Maybe a courtroom attorney.  I mean,  it's the only thing  I could think of  because you get to talk  and show off a little bit.  Who's next, Travis?  Next,  we have Mike  in Rockland County.  A lot of Mikes.  It's like that fucking  eighth Mike.  Hi, Michael.  How you doing?  Jim,  thank you for taking my call.  Sure.  Jim,  I have a question.  Is there a correlation  between being a comedian  and being a good writer?  Is there any correlation?  I'm a teacher  and I like to sometimes say, 
[04:01:30]  hey,  I talked on the radio to someone  and this person says this.  Yeah,  I think so.  Sure.  I mean,  again,  they don't always  go hand in hand.  There's plenty of writers  who are not funny  and there's plenty of comics  who are pretty good  off the cuff  but are not great writers.  But I think most times  if you're good at one,  if you're good at comedy,  you're probably a good writer  because you usually  have to write material.  If you're a good writer,  you might not be good at comedy  because you might write fiction  or you might write fantasy  or whatever it is.  Like Stephen King, 
[04:02:00]  excuse me,  is a genius writer  but I don't know  if he's a good comic.  So I would say it works one way  but not necessarily the other.  Would you say that  when you're writing  or when you're thinking  of your comedy,  I mean,  do you have like  scrap the newspaper  you write it on?  I mean,  do you put it on a gum wrapper?  Is that how it works?  Fucking scrap someone  of my homeless?  Do you ever write it on a can  you're trying to recycle  for five cents?  No.  I used to write it  when I worked  at a place called  Christoph Silver.  I would stand  on the packing line  and write jokes  on the back  of fragile stickers. 
[04:02:30]  I still have them.  And you know,  Florentine,  I've saved them  since 1990  because I always wanted  to go on stage  and do those jokes  and tape it.  Jim did his old awful jokes  out of a notebook  and these were not  connected thoughts.  But he did it  without an audience.  It's something  I still want to do.  And I have  23 years of those notes  and the first five years  of stuff is fucking horrible.  But yeah,  I would write it down anyway.  Right now I'll still do it  but now I text it to myself.  I'll write a text.  Hey Jim,  do a joke about 
[04:03:00]  oh that lady  bouncing the red ball  whatever it is  and I'll write the joke.  Hey,  I was walking down  the street today  and I saw some cunt  bouncing a red ball.  That's the whole joke.  Right.  Because I call her a cunt.  Thanks for taking my call  man.  I appreciate it.  I saw a lady  bouncing a red ball.  Hopefully she had cancer  she's unaware of.  You know,  it's really an unnecessary  attack on this lady.  Go ahead.  John in Maryland.  Hello, John.  Hey Jim,  how are you?  I'm okay, buddy.  A little nauseous actually.  being an expert 
[04:03:30]  on the subject  I think I may be  a sex addict.  Yeah.  I  I'm happily married  but  I've  been soliciting  prostitutes.  I know you told a guy  two weeks ago  don't start.  Well,  I started  and  I can't stop man.  I keep telling myself  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  but  if I get the money  in my pocket  and I see one  I'll solicit them  and  I actually caught  an STD about  a year or two ago 
[04:04:00]  and  had to go to the doctor's  of course  and get checked  and then get medication  and the wife had to get checked  and she said  you know  this is  you fucked up.  You fuck up again  and you're done.  Right.  You know,  I got cured  and  like I said  you know  I try not to  but  I've recently  done it a couple times  and I think I've contracted  something again  so  Jesus.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Are you fucking  raw dogging these chicks?  No dude  just oral  just fucking oral.  You're getting blown? 
[04:04:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Wow that's bad luck.  Jesus Christ.  You know what happens though  and  last time  I'm pretty sure  it was from  a  from a black girl  and you know  just recently  I just happened to run across  another black girl  and I'm pretty sure  that's where I got it from again.  Bad  bad coincidence  on the  Yeah.  Well  I hope Anthony's not listening  and I'll have to  fucking an hour tomorrow  it was a tub of guns  and they suck your dicks  and give you diseases  fucking an hour. 
[04:05:00]  No I don't know  I would  look man  especially if you're married  and you're bringing something home  you gotta stop  I mean  try meetings  12 step meetings  there are  there are 12 step programs  for sex addiction  believe me I know  and  or a therapist  but you should absolutely  address it  because  maybe the marriage is done  but  you know  even though  I'm single  I can do  whatever I want  and it makes me miserable  I'm not cheating on anybody 
[04:05:30]  I'm not fucking coming back  with diseases  it still  is isolating  and depressing  and all consuming  and  the hours  and I thank you buddy  for calling  the good luck to you brother  the  the hours  it takes  the hours of your life  the  the total distraction  it is  when you're just looking for whores  or when you're online  looking at X2  or X Hamster  it's all of these hours  that you're not thinking of other things  and you're trying to go to bed  and your fucking wiring's all fucked up 
[04:06:00]  because your mind is like  and you're jerking off to porn  until 1130 at night  and you gotta get up at 5  you know  it is an all  consuming  fucking  it's an odor  it's like  it's like if you set a room on fire  that smell  that stays in the room  that's what sex addiction is like  it's all over you man  it's fucking  people that don't have it  don't get it  oh man  I'm a sex addict  I was looking at this girl's tits twice  really?  really?  you ever jerk off  until your back hurts? 
[04:06:30]  I mean fucking  I mean you know  sex addiction is just  brutal  I mean honestly  I could give you the inside scoop  on sex addiction  because I have it  I could also give you the inside scoop  on Steven Singer  which I might as well do  because that's kind of like jerking off  you know  you put a nice ring on your finger  and then you just crank it  and look at it  wow look at how nice my ring looks  but Steve is a real boob in life  but when it comes to  helping people select the right gifts  for a special someone  he's a genius  I mean did you mess up  with the Christmas gifts?  maybe she wanted 
[04:07:00]  maybe she wanted  what would she want?  a new scarf  maybe she said  I'd like a reindeer scarf  and instead  you brought home chlamydia  maybe  maybe you got blown  by a black cooker  like that last poor fella  and instead of a nice reindeer scarf  you filled your wife's box  with sadness  if so  not to worry  Steven  will guarantee  that you hit a home run  for Valentine's Day  he's got the perfect gift  for Valentine's Day  and it starts at just $69 
[04:07:30]  that's about what a blowjob  goes for on the street  it's been a long time  but I'm guessing  for $69  you can easily get a blowjob  so give up one blowjob  and buy your wife  a little something special  it's a real long stem rose  dipped in 24 karat pure gold  a lot nicer  than where you were  dipping your penis  you're not gonna hand her  this dipped rose  and she's gonna catch  something off it  ooh it's herpetic  these roses last forever  ooh  excuse me  you get credit for this gift  for a lifetime  whenever her friends  come over and go  who the fuck gave you that 
[04:08:00]  it's fantastic  you can go  that piece of shit  cheating husband of mine  but I can't leave him  because his gift buying  is superb  why talk about  Valentine's Day so soon  I mean come on  it's January  because Steven Singer  sells out of these roses  every year  and we always say  Steven  why don't you buy more  and he says  Jim  these are a special item  and I say  Steven  our intimacy right now  is making me want to  throw up  and he says  Jim  I couldn't agree more  he wants to make sure 
[04:08:30]  you get the first shot  at ordering his brand new  hot pink love rose  that was what he called  his dick for a long time  except it was more like  a fucking  a wilted flower  with a sore on it  limited qualities  of this hot pink love rose  are available  reserve yours today  Steven makes it very easy  you go online  I hate steven singer dot com  click on the real  long stem rose  choose your color  because you have a choice  with Steven Singer  that's great  as opposed to when  he wants to have sex with you  then there's no choice  Steven removes your choice 
[04:09:00]  when he wants to fuck you  it's called  it's called a fucking  handkerchief with chloroform  and a chloroform  and you can have it  shipped to your door  for free  in a beautiful gold foil  gift box  each rose comes  with your own  personalized message  this is a gift  you can trust  from a guy  you can trust  we like Steven  even though the man  is a horse's ass  he's great at what  he does with jewelry  if you're in Philadelphia  it's the other corner  of 8th and Walnut  1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  or IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM  and who's next  I want to take one more 
[04:09:30]  I can't end on a  Steven Singer read  one more  one more  I want to help  I'm like fucking  Liam Neeson  if I could have just  helped one more  I want to save  one more person  do one more  Dan in Chicago  you're last  hi Dan  you've been fucking  a crazy girl  killed your rabbit  what's up  hey Jim how you doing  how are you  hey I got a question  I have problems  with premature  ejaculation  it's not all the time  when my wife has a  problem with it  I went to the extent  of even getting  Viagra 
[04:10:00]  and sometimes  that helps  and sometimes  it doesn't  what I would suggest  is first of all  stop thinking of me  because that makes  everybody cum immediately  it's just the effect  my face has  or you could try  edging when you  jerk off  I would practice  masturbating  watch some porn  jerk off  get yourself closer  then stop  train your body  to be able to  stop a little bit  so this way  when you're fucking  and you feel  it's starting  to build up  you can just  pull out a little bit  and go  ha ha ha ha  and then you let 
[04:10:30]  your dick just  dangle like Bobo  and leak  it fucking leaks  like an invalid  you ever take  an invalid  and shake them  in their hospital  Johnny  and then you push  them over the  side of the bed  and they go  and they leak  out the side  that's what your  cock looks like  when you pull it out  but I would suggest  doing that  practice jerking off  and then practice  maybe have her  suck it  and then when  you get close  to coming  and she'll  back up  and tell her  stop  train yourself  to extend  okay 
[04:11:00]  alright  that's the thing  gentlemen  when I'm  checking off  on the computer  I can go  half an hour  45 minutes  and then  like when  the dick gets  wet  it's like  almost instant  sometimes  damn  well why don't  you just do  two strokes  and pull out  talk a little bit  put it back in  a couple strokes  make yourself  stop before  you know  you're going  to come  make yourself  stop  you can always  feel it  building up  and if you  can't feel  it building up  if you have  no control  once it  builds up  then go  for 30 seconds 
[04:11:30]  and stop  or 20 seconds  and stop  before you  feel it  building up  train yourself  to stop  before it  builds up  and then  you'll probably  get a little  bit more  longevity  that's my  suggestion  I'm just  guessing  alright  good luck  good luck  my quick coming  well my  quick coming  friend  alright guys  I gotta go  hop on a plane  I gotta catch  a bus  I'm like  De Niro signing  off with  fucking Liza  and Jerry  thank you guys  for calling in  it was a lot  of good calls  today  and thank you  Travis for  very expertly  manning the  phones  and thank you  Sal for
