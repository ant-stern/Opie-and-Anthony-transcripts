<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a raucous celebration of Jim Norton's birthday, punctuated by numerous tangents and controversies.  The show began with self-deprecating humor and introductions of crew members, immediately transitioning into a discussion of listener "Mr. Old" (Thomas Young)'s arrest for firing an AK-47 in his backyard during an on-air "shoot-out" segment – an event that garnered national news coverage. The hosts played audio of the call and reviewed a growing list of show-related arrests, estimating around 20, including those stemming from the "Voyeur Bus" and "Sex for Sam" stunts.  They also recounted a frightening experience during a Harlem photoshoot for the Boston Globe, where the lack of XM radio security made them feel unsafe despite having a limousine.  Rich Voss was present in studio, gifting Norton for his birthday. A voicemail from Norton's mother, reacting to a previous show segment, was also played.

The show then shifted to a discussion about their near-miss in a dangerous neighborhood, highlighted by a call from Malik warning them about the area's safety.  This segued into promotion of "Whip Him Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their cars, followed by more birthday celebrations for Norton, promising "Jimmy Day" t-shirts.  Morgan Spurlock, creator of "Super Size Me" and "30 Days," joined the show, discussing his weight loss, the challenges of filming "Super Size Me," the ethical considerations of his work, and his experiences filming "30 Days," including a stint in jail.  Rich Voss contributed humorous anecdotes, including one about procuring an engagement ring at a 12-step meeting.  Listener calls further contributed to the eclectic mix of topics, including a discussion of a "30 Days" episode featuring a straight man living in a gay neighborhood.

The controversy surrounding Kevin Smith's *Clerks II* and Joel Siegel's walkout became a major focus.  The hosts discussed Siegel's outburst, Smith's blog response, and the ensuing media attention.  Smith himself joined the show, recounting his experiences with the MPAA and reacting to Siegel's behavior. A heated phone call with Siegel ensued, with the hosts criticizing his unprofessionalism while Siegel defended his actions, citing offensive content and denying writing some of the puns attributed to him in his reviews.  After the call, Jason Mewes joined in studio, expressing his enthusiasm for the film. Norton's birthday celebrations continued with a boisterous outdoor event, including two male strippers and a pedicab ride for Norton to the XM studio.

This outdoor birthday celebration involved handing out OzFest tickets and "Jimmy Day" t-shirts to a large crowd of enthusiastic fans, with much crude and sexually suggestive banter from the hosts.  Gifts included pornographic magazines and a piñata filled with pink gum.  Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes were present in the studio during parts of this segment. The conversation took a turn towards bowel movements, hemorrhoids, and drug-related anecdotes from Smith and Mewes. The hosts reflected on the large turnout and the passion of their fanbase, briefly mentioning their St. Patrick's Cathedral sex controversy.

A later segment delved into detailed discussions of drug use and paranoia, featuring a caller recounting his cocaine and crack experiences, including a bizarre transaction involving a jug of pennies and subsequent paranoia involving a mouse he mistook for a rat.  The caller mentioned Kevin Smith unexpectedly appearing during one of these episodes. The hosts discussed their own drug experiences, interspersed with listener calls, sponsor plugs (Rivoli's, Free FM, Centerfoldstrips.com, OzFest, Jägermeister), mentions of a birthday cake and billboard, and a discussion of their strong Philadelphia ratings against David Lee Roth.  The segment concluded with the reading of a lengthy, self-deprecating poem by Norton written during rehab, exploring themes of addiction and recovery.

Finally, the show discussed a *Clerks II* MySpace contest, with Norton detailing his competitive, unsuccessful attempt to gain friends, even considering paying people.  He also recounted using inanimate objects in his top eight. A caller, Brian Jersey, mentioned a possible past interaction with one of the hosts.  Norton shared an embarrassing story about trying to break his own arm, followed by another host sharing a story about his uncle sending a false death telegram. The hosts promoted their upcoming "Opie and Anthony Traveling Buyers" comedy tour, concluding with discussion of Norton's *Clerks II* appearance and interaction with Siegel, a closing jingle reiterating "Whip them out Wednesday," and excited comments about a woman removing her shirt on camera.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  You're a bust!  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news with perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's like, shut down!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No. 
[00:01:00]  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Happy birthday, Jimmy!  Alright.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[00:01:30]  Jimmy went to the bathroom.  Everybody's calling and I wish Jim Norton a happy birthday.  It's really his birthday.  It really is today.  I got a little something for him.  It's like a, you know, 21-inch balloon.  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  Well, today's going to be interesting.  We're always in it. 
[00:02:00]  We have so much to do today.  By the way, this is the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I'm just writing down all the stuff we're going to attempt to talk about today.  Good luck getting to it.  We want to talk about Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It is, wow.  We'll get into that in a few minutes.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  We want to just say hello to Philly because the ratings come out today.  Oh, hi, Philly.  We're going to interview Kevin Smith from Clerks 2.  He's coming in.  Yes, he'll be in studio.  And Joel Siegel, a very big movie reviewer here in the New York area, 
[00:02:30]  walked out of Clerks 2.  Walked out of Clerks 2.  And I say bravo to Kevin Smith in Clerks 2.  You want that to happen.  We'll get into that story in a little bit.  And he wrote a blog about it.  And it is typical, pure Kevin Smith.  It's hysterically funny and just twists the screw to this ass.  Who walked out?  Joel Siegel.  Joel Siegel.  What do you expect?  The Channel 11 guy?  Yeah.  That dork with the glasses?  Yeah, we'll get into it, though. 
[00:03:00]  We'll get into it.  It's great.  And then what else?  Let me look here.  Oh, our Harlem photo shoot.  Yes.  Maybe we'll start with that.  That was frightening.  And then one of our fans might have been arrested for shooting a gun.  Might have.  What's that?  Might have.  How about one of our fans was arrested?  One of our faithful fans was arrested.  Didn't even know about this.  I had no clue, man.  I mean, I'm up every morning around 4, 4, 15. 
[00:03:30]  And I go through my things I do every morning.  Your things.  And one of them is to just kind of Google our names and see what's going on in the news.  It's a good way to keep tabs on if we're in trouble or not.  Right.  And, yeah, this started with the whole Sex with Sam thing about four years ago.  And ever since, I Google our names every day.  And it seems like we're in some kind of newspaper just about every day now.  Yeah.  And I'm like, ah, might as well Google our names, see what's going on. 
[00:04:00]  And I see, bam, AP story being picked up by pretty much every newspaper in America.  Yeah, it's just hitting.  I had no clue.  Just hitting.  It's just hitting, and it's probably going to make the news.  I guess it was the lead story on 1010 Winds here in New York City, the big news station.  I stayed in town.  See?  Look at that.  I stayed in town last night so I didn't have to drive in this morning.  And I would have heard that, and it would have been a shock to me.  But I would have driven off the road. 
[00:04:30]  And if it wasn't for the Middle East crisis, this could have made the front page of the New York Daily News today.  They're firing off a few more rounds over there in the Middle East than this guy did.  It made page four of the New York Daily News.  Yeah.  Shots heard round the dial land him in hot water.  That's why you've got to listen to the Opie and Anthony show every day.  Yeah, you just don't know what's going to happen.  You just don't know when it's all going to end again.  That's true, too.  Because I got that feeling this morning, like, oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:05:00]  What did he kill?  Oh, I hope he didn't kill anybody.  What did he kill that it's on page four?  Nah, that would have been front page.  That's why you've got to listen longer.  You've got to listen every day.  You've got to appreciate this fine show like we do.  We do appreciate this show.  We certainly do.  So the headline, I guess this is where we start today, shots heard round the dial land him in hot water.  A trigger-happy Long Island man's call to a popular radio show landed him in the sights of the Suffolk County Police yesterday, authorities said. 
[00:05:30]  Oops.  Yeah, he was trigger-happy.  Remember yesterday we couldn't even talk to the guy?  Couldn't even talk to him.  We do things called shootouts.  It's a goof on the whole stupid shout-out thing that other stations do.  A lot of the hip-hop stations do shout-outs.  Call up, you know, I want to give a shout-out to this one, that one, whatever the hell that even means.  So we have a listenership that's nationwide.  And a lot of these places, you can fire your guns on your property, do it safely. 
[00:06:00]  It's a shootout.  Or at a sanctioned range.  We had a guy just the other day that was at a rifle range.  And he called us up.  And he's in a legal setting to fire a weapon.  So he shot.  And that's, you know, we just like hearing the sound of gunfire.  Well, this guy yesterday calls up and goes, I want to shoot my AK-47.  We're like, all right, where are, and as we're talking, I'm trying to get some background. 
[00:06:30]  He just starts firing away.  Like, wait, wait, wait, where are you?  What are you doing?  We want to, you know, set it up a little bit more.  But the guy never really stopped hitting his trigger long enough for us to really get into who he was, where he was, what he was doing.  And apparently.  He said he needed a tree that needed to be corrected.  He goes, I got to kill a tree.  So he was out in his yard, which apparently he says is a large wooded area.  And it turns out it wasn't that large at all. 
[00:07:00]  He did say he shot deep into the woods.  But it's Long Island.  But it's good to know.  I mean, the New York ratings came out yesterday.  And we did very, or a couple days ago now.  And we did very, very well.  We talked about it yesterday on the show.  And it's good to know that a lot of people are listening because we have a listener shooting an AK-47.  Then we have another listener that doesn't know the shooter that heard us on the radio and also heard the shots live.  And then decides to call his father.  And then the father got involved and got this guy arrested. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, so he's on our show shooting his gun.  And then another listener that lives close to the guy hears us talking about it and hears the gunfire.  Right.  So he's like, hmm, let me put two and two together here.  Yes, and then called somebody.  And we're always in it.  The Suffolk County Police Department showed up at the guy's house, talked to him, apparently arrested him for a discharge of a firearm in an area you're not supposed to be doing that.  Yeah.  Which is pretty much all of Long Island except for a range. 
[00:08:00]  You can't just fire your guns out there.  It's not like Ted Nugent's house.  Right.  You know, this is the Long Island.  When you live there, you can't just go firing your gun out a window.  Well, the story continues.  Thomas Young, remember he said he was Mr. Old yesterday.  We're trying to get the phone call.  Oh, he did call himself Mr. Old.  We have it?  Young.  His real name was Young.  I get it.  All right.  The phone call is coming over.  The guys are still working on it.  Thomas Young allegedly fired five shots.  Five.  Five shots into the woods behind his Melville home while conversing on air with the Opie and Anthony show on WFNYFM yesterday morning. 
[00:08:30]  It's a range right on Spagnoli Road, which is probably two miles from this guy.  He could have gone to the range.  Hey, man.  Gas prices are really high.  Two miles.  They're way up there.  Young's neighbor.  This is where the story gets interesting.  Gary Rayna, it looks like, heard the shots, as did Rayna's son, who called his father to say he had heard Young's wild exchange on the radio show while driving to work. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  The neighbor's a tattletale.  What a snitch.  I'm going outside to kill a tree, Young said, before firing five shots, according to cops.  Young was cooperative and admitted to cops that he had fired the rifle, saying he shot deep into the woods so no one would be hurt.  He was charged with discharging firearms in a prohibited area, and his rifle was confiscated, cops said.  Damn.  They took away his gun?  That's the Daily News story.  Then you got the Newsday story. 
[00:09:30]  The Newsday story, by the way, I hope my mommy is awake right now, because it just, my mother loves thumbing through Newsday.  Oh, I got to get to my Sudoku.  Oh, so she'll be thumbing through Newsday.  And the Newsday headline, what is the headline?  Newsday headline is radio show listeners' stunt ends in arrest.  In arrest.  And it's got a picture of me and Opie in the story.  So you would assume that we got arrested. 
[00:10:00]  We got arrested.  And that's what they're hoping, you would assume.  Yeah.  To make it a little crazier.  My poor mommy's going to see that when she wakes up and goes, because she reads Newsday every day.  And she's going to see that and be in a panic.  Well, and another arrest.  Someday we've got to add up all the arrests this show has gotten.  It's gotten quite a few people arrested.  Yeah.  Quite a few.  Come on, we're looking at one right here in studio.  Jim Norton got arrested. 
[00:10:30]  Jimmy.  I'm the famous voyeur bus.  Did some hard time.  Had some, what did they call it, gay sex in the prison cell?  No, that was with one of the guards.  Oh, okay.  To garner some favors and some cigarettes.  Yeah, I wanted some mustard for my bologna sandwich.  That's going to cost you.  It certainly did.  We could do this through the bars.  So, yeah, we've had a lot of people arrested for this show.  And so far, our record's impeccable.  I'm waiting for that to end at some point. 
[00:11:00]  Sex for Sam was three, I think.  We had three for Sex for Sam.  Couple and guy.  We had this guy from yesterday.  That's four.  And how many were arrested for the voyeur bus, Jim?  Do you remember?  It was like 12.  19?  Maybe it was 12.  I don't remember the number 12, but maybe it was higher.  Two-digit number.  It was definitely a double.  Yeah, it was.  Could be higher than that, Jimmy.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  So we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  20 arrests.  I think more than that.  More?  Yeah, because I think there was more than 12 in the voyeur bus. 
[00:11:30]  I'm almost sure there was nine guys.  Were there only three girls arrested?  Maybe you're right.  About 20.  I mean, it's not hundreds, but I think it might be.  There was the voyeur bus guys, and there were, what, three of those?  For some reason, I remember there being nine of us.  It was me, Steve.  Those three.  Steve.  Rick.  Oh, my God.  Rick.  Rick.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Louis Black.  Louis Black.  That's eight right there.  The film crew that was filming the whole thing.  The film crew.  That's at least a couple of people. 
[00:12:00]  The bus driver.  Two girls.  We're already up to 12 people.  The bus driver, 13.  I don't know why I'm thinking there was more than three girls.  Whatever, we can go back and look it up.  Three girls?  Then that's 14.  There's a lot of people.  We're up to 20 arrests for this show.  20 arrests.  Do we have the most arrests ever for a radio show?  Probably, yeah.  That should be a record.  They should do a little story on that.  And we're trying to slow down.  We're trying to slow down.  Yeah, we're really trying to slow it down. 
[00:12:30]  And we have.  I mean, this is just one arrest now.  Yeah, the first one in four years.  We're doing pretty good.  First one in a while.  So here's the phone call from yesterday and the audio of the incident.  This guy ended up getting arrested.  And it's made pretty much every newspaper in America.  It's a highlight clip right now.  Soon, I believe it will be called Exhibit A.  All right.  We got Mr. Old on the line.  He wants to do something for us.  And then we'll move on here.  Mr. Old, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I have a tree to be corrected. 
[00:13:00]  You have a tree that needs to be corrected?  Corrected.  And how are you going to correct this tree?  We have a 7.62.  7.62 AK?  Yes.  Are you ready?  This is AK-47.  What is he talking about?  See, a lot of people on the radio do shout-outs.  We do shoot-outs.  We do shoot-outs.  We like people calling up with their weapons and firing them.  We especially like when the homies call up and do the shoot-outs.  Yeah, that's, like, much better.  Much better than a white guy.  Because you know the pistols turn sideways. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  A few innocent bystanders are getting hit no matter what they aim at.  Mr. Old?  Yes.  Are you ready to go?  Yes.  Or did you shoot already?  Uh, just a tree.  What?  Just what?  You can't speak.  Did someone shoot you in the mouth?  And that's why you're getting your anger out on the trees.  I can't hear you.  Oh, my God.  Just remember when you shoot, aim for white meat.  Take a walk, cop.  Shoot your phone.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Well, that wasn't bad.  That was very cool.  Your cell phone doesn't pick up gunfire very well.  Oh, no.  And the gun on himself?  Well, I got to run now.  Oh, yeah.  You run.  Run for your life.  And that's how it went down yesterday.  We're back live.  How is it?  That's all.  It was actually a who cares phone call.  It sucked.  How many shots did he fire?  Well, the paper says five.  Five?  Maybe it was five. 
[00:14:30]  And people have to hear my stupid dog day afternoon quote in the middle of it.  All these people hear it and go, what does that mean?  She's a white meat.  What does that mean?  Why?  Hey, let's go to Brian on Long Island.  He's going to update the arrest list.  Yes, Brian.  Yeah, you guys, a couple years back on NW, chick called in all banged up, and you guys  had her, you know, followed by the police.  I believe she got arrested.  Is that right?  For what?  I think she called in to play Guess What's in My Pants, and she was hammered.  She was drunk driving in her car, yeah. 
[00:15:00]  And we started messing with her, and actually, we got in a lot of trouble from our faithful  listeners going, I can't believe you would do that to somebody.  But we were just trying to make some good radio and having fun with the lady, and we're  asking her where she's driving, and she's admitting she was driving drunk, and of course,  a lot of the cops are also fans of the show, and they ended up arresting her, yeah.  And you have to realize, sir, drunk driving is dangerous, but firing an AK-47 is just funny.  All right, I forgot about her.  Thanks, Brian.  We'll add her to the list as well. 
[00:15:30]  Well, it's Jimmy's birthday today, and it's his real birthday, and not those fake ones  over the course of the year.  Right.  People call up and say, happy birthday, Jimmy, and we have to say, no, it's not his birthday.  He wants it to be his birthday every day.  Every time someone walks in, I keep waiting for it to be my party crew.  Party crew?  Oh, your party crew.  Oh, like Peter Brady?  Yeah.  When he walks in, hey, guy.  Oh, no surprise party here. 
[00:16:00]  It's just Dad and Mr. Phillips.  Hey, let's say hi to Chris in New York.  And what are they doing?  All right, Chris, what's up?  Didn't the guy during the assault on the media get arrested with the air horn next to the reporter?  I don't think so, no.  No, he never got caught.  All right, punch him out.  That's good.  That's what you want to say to a national audience.  No, he never got caught.  He got away.  Not caught.  All right, it's Jimmy's birthday.  In honor of that, we're going to play some of the Jimmy bits as we go to break here.  I want to start with the famous mom's voicemail thing. 
[00:16:30]  You want to set this up, Jimmy?  I think we're being heard in Grand Rapids for the first time this morning.  Oh, hi, Grand Rapids.  Grand Rapids.  Talk about a dream come true.  Yes.  On Grand Rapids.  On my birthday, it couldn't get any better.  It's not just Rapid.  It's Grand.  We could finally retire.  We're finally being heard in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Our careers are complete.  I've been known for doing some...  Why would you say that?  What?  I am thrilled to be in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
[00:17:00]  So am I.  Right arm...  What are you making that arm motion?  What does that mean, Opie?  It looks like you're cocking a shotgun.  Oh.  Yes.  I am so happy to be...  Or shotting a...  Well.  In Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Yeah.  Well, I had...  Let's just say I've been a little lonely over the last couple of years.  Aw.  Yeah.  Birthday boys get lonely.  And so therefore we go on Craigslist and look for, you know, prostitutes.  Right.  And we forget that our mothers listen to the radio show. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that's the weirdest part about doing this type of radio.  You do have, you know, your parents and family members listening every day.  Yeah, so there are embarrassing life stories that we like to discuss.  And it makes it very interesting when you have to go to the family get-together.  The family functions.  The family functions.  And they have to bring up all this horrific stuff they heard on the show.  So I was listening to the radio and, yeah.  Yeah.  Could you not?  Yeah, could you just give me a hot dog while you're up, please?  Turn it off.  I talked about something horrific one time and my dad, I remember when I saw him, he goes, 
[00:18:00]  I saw your mother and I were listening to the radio and we just made eye contact and we  started to laugh.  Because he knew exactly what you were talking about.  And I'm like, God, that wasn't true.  And he goes, no, I know.  I told your mother that wasn't true.  And you're just looking with the knowing eyes that it was absolute fact.  Yes.  Not only that, that you know where you got it from.  I hate to think my dad is the same bug I do.  Oh, dad, you goose.  Imagine if you got it from him.  I hope not.  And he was doing all the same things you're doing. 
[00:18:30]  Craigslist before there was a Craigslist.  Oh, yeah.  What would you do?  The yellow pages.  All right.  So I got a call from my mother.  My mom, she's pretty down to earth.  She wasn't panicking.  She just kind of felt bad that her stupid, mushy son was out spending his cash.  And she left me a message and it really was very funny.  So I kind of saved it and put it on my CD and exploited it on the show.  Yeah.  And here it is.  And she was highly embarrassed about it.  This is Jim Norton's mom.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you? 
[00:19:00]  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also there's gyms in New York. 
[00:19:30]  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering, I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing. 
[00:20:00]  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay?  Sweetie, I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  It's Jimmy Day in honor of the happiest boy at school.  Guy.  Jim Norton.

Yes, and star.  And star.  I saw Clerks 2.  I loved it.  And there's a lot of controversy around the movie. 
[00:21:30]  We'll get into that in a few minutes.  And Rich Voss is in studio.  A true friend, Rich Voss.  And he just handed Jimmy a birthday gift.  It's his birthday.  Thank you, Rich.  And you're making everyone look bad.  I know.  Because now we're all like, oh, man.  Were we supposed to give Jimmy a gift today?  Every time you let Jimmy come in here, you're giving him a gift.  Yes, every day is my birthday when I walk in.  Aw.  Because I've been given the gift of friendship.  And the gift of laughter.  Absolutely.  However, I prefer Voss's gift.  Which part? 
[00:22:00]  What did you get?  An iPod Nano, which is excellent.  Because I have an iPod.  And I hate the fact I can fit so much on it.  I kind of wanted one that just holds a couple of songs.  So, thanks.  Now, this is good for working out.  It's nice and skinny.  Which is perfect.  What else do you get?  I'm kidding.  It's great.  You got everything.  I couldn't think, you know.  Thank you.  What do you get the guy who has everything?  How about an ab roller?  I could use an ab roller.  A chin implant.  A neck reduction.  Just lympho. 
[00:22:30]  Light bulb all around.  Also, today, in honor of Jimmy's birthday, when we do the walkover to XM, we got Jimmy  Day t-shirts for everybody.  Hopefully for everybody.  I don't know what kind of crowd we're going to get today.  But I think we got, what, a couple hundred maybe?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  We're going to have a couple hundred when we get to XM, too.  We should be able to take care of everybody.  Hope Elo wants 198 shirts.  Homeless guys walking around New York.  We should give them to homeless.  Let's give them to some homeless guys, too, some Jimmy Day shirts.  I like that.  They're all Jimmy Day shirts that we didn't give out that last time. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, because we screwed up.  Maybe Patty could use them to dry the oil from her hair.  I couldn't get that image out of my head.  Like, all night long, it's just, ugh, tossing and turning, thinking of stalker Patty.  She's been a stalker of this show for years.  Shows up at everything.  And for some reason, she thought it was a good idea to pour baby oil in her hair and then wash her hair and then show up at our walkover yesterday.  You can't just wash that stuff out.  It's like what you used to do as a gag on Halloween. 
[00:23:30]  You'd dump baby oil in people's hair because you know it would be like days they'd have greasy hair.  And she's walking around with this shiny forehead and her little chiclet teeth and her E.T. body.  Ugh.  You gotta love Patty, though.  Her hair.  Do ya?  No.  She thought it was, here's what it is, she's seen like that gel look that people have.  And she's dumb, she doesn't know how you get the gel look.  She is stupid, she just can't get it right.  You buy gel.  You buy gel, you don't pour baby oil on your hair. 
[00:24:00]  Baby oil on her hair.  Looked like she had like jerry curl.  That was awful.  Like oil, like her head had been just dipped in oil in an angry assault from the back.  All it needed was a match.  I gotta break in, we got Mr. Old on the phone.  Mr. Old?  No way.  If you're just tuning in, here's the deal.  We had a guy, he fired his AK-47 yesterday on our show.  We do this from time to time.  We do shootouts.  And Mr. Old did it yesterday and he got arrested.  He was firing it into his backyard, destroying a tree. 
[00:24:30]  A neighbor, who's also a listener of the show, heard it, called his father, who also heard the shots, called the Suffolk County Police, got Mr. Old arrested.  And we're in every newspaper in America today because of it.  As is Mr. Old.  And the news is starting to report on it.  Are they?  The newspaper's got the story.  It was an AP story overnight.  It's just hitting as we speak.  And now the news programs are picking up on it.  Here's News 12 on Long Island. 
[00:25:00]  A Melville man is facing charges this morning for firing gunshots into his own backyard.  And it was all heard over the air on the Opie and Anthony show.  It happened yesterday morning, just about 7 o'clock.  Police say this man, 30-year-old Thomas Young, was on the radio show when he stated,  I'm going outside to kill a tree.  Well, five gunshots were heard over the radio.  When police went to Young's house, he admitted he did shoot his rifle during that radio show.  Oh, boy, does that just sound silly. 
[00:25:30]  When did you start calling them trees?  Oh, yeah.  Boss, right out.  Right out of the gate.  How's your daughter?  She's a tree lover.  That's how she is.  Two trees moved into the neighborhood.  The more trees there are, the less your house is worth.  Why are there a disproportionate number of trees in prison? 
[00:26:00]  I saw this tree climbing a tree.  Oh, my.  What?  That's pretty funny.  Two trees.  You know, the only tree.  Oh, Jesus.  I tell you one thing, though.  I see how a white girl could enjoy that tree.  Hey, hey.  I'll be kissing an oak over here.  Hey, are we allowed to give Mr. Old $1,000 for his...  Oh, my gosh.  Well, I mean, we have $1,000 a day to give away. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe for, like, bail money or something.  Let's talk to him.  All right.  Courtesy of Clerks 2, we do have $1,000 a day to give away.  Maybe we should give it to Mr. Old.  He got us some publicity today.  Hey, Mr. Old.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Where are you calling from?  Hey, buddy.  Thank you.  Where are you calling from?  Home.  Oh, you're back home?  Yes, I got bailed out really quick.  How much did bail cost you?  $100.  $100?  Yep.  Ah, that's not that bad.  That's easy. 
[00:27:00]  Did you have to pay 10%?  Dude, the cops down at the precinct were hysterical.  They were all listening to you guys.  Dude, they were all laughing at me.  Of course they were, you silly goose.  They didn't want to interrupt me.  They were like, dude, we've got to take you in because we've got to check your gun.  Make sure you know it's okay.  Yeah.  You haven't killed anyone with that gun or anything, right?  No.  All right.  Let's go check out.  I got it, Brandon.  You're going to get it back?  Yeah, in like a month.  It's got to go through the lab to make sure it's not automatic. 
[00:27:30]  I was just like joking around.  I was like, why don't you fire it and figure it out?  Why don't you shoot it?  Hey, Mr. Old, walk us through it.  So we heard what happened on the radio yesterday, and you even said, I got to go.  I got to run because, what did you say at the end of the call?  I forget it again.  You said, I got to run.  Yeah, I got to run.  I figured, you know, someone might have heard it, but I was really deep in the woods.  Uh-huh.  You know where the WLW tower is?  Exit 48.  Exit 48 of the Long Island Expressway. 
[00:28:00]  Big ass tower there.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like in that vicinity in a valley.  Okay.  And I had the big ass tree in my target, in my scope.  Boom.  Four, you know, nice grouping.  What was behind the tree?  Uh, just a hill.  Oh, okay.  It was a very safe, I wouldn't want to hurt anybody.  Of course.  It was a very safe shooting.  Yeah.  All right.  So you shoot it, and then you go back to your house.  And then, yeah, you hang up, and then...  I lost my cell phone, so I had to come back,  get my mom's cell phone, and go back to the woods, 
[00:28:30]  calling it, and calling it, and calling it.  Oh, until you heard it ringing?  Yeah, until I finally found it.  Okay.  And then what happened?  And then I get back to my house.  Two hours later, ding-dong, three cops.  I was just like, what?  Oh, yeah, that's right, two hours ago.  And how did they get you?  Your neighbor called up?  Yeah, my friend neighbor.  But, I mean, he was looking out.  He didn't know it was me at first, I'm sure. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, he didn't know it was you.  Yeah.  So he's just like, hey, I'm hearing some gunshots going on.  Yeah, neighborhood watch.  Oh, neighborhood watch.  I guess.  So he calls the cops, and then how did they figure out it was you?  I guess they were listening?  Well, what they told me is they have records of all the guns in the block.  So, I don't know.  I don't know if that's, you know, BS, but.  No, I'm sure that's probably true, when you fill out the forms, when you buy a gun.  Yeah, and, you know, they knew my total record, so, you know, obviously. 
[00:29:30]  But the cops are very cool.  I mean, they were like, we don't want to arrest you, but we have to.  We've got to take in the gun, make sure it's, you know, legal.  Hasn't been used in anything?  Uh, no.  Yeah.  I haven't fired in five years until yesterday.  See what we make people do.  Felt good, didn't it?  And we have to go to court for this?  We have to go to.  Yeah, I got to go on August 23rd to the 3rd District Court on Newark Avenue. 
[00:30:00]  And what's the actual charge?  It's, uh, what is it?  Um, something, uh, ordinance, can't fire a high-powered rifle, something like that.  Right.  Is that okay?  Within city limits, you can't fire high-powered rifles.  You know what?  The funny thing is, I got arrested by Suffolk cops, but I was way into Nassau.  Oh, were you?  Because my house is on the board in Nassau.  Great, dude.  Now the Nassau County Police are going to come and pay you a visit, too.  Yeah, you just showed them up.  They can go. 
[00:30:30]  You know what people are finding really funny about this phone call, Jim, in Boston?  Did Mr. Old just admit to still living with his mom?  Well, I do.  I take care of my mommy.  You're a good boy.  You're a good boy.  When she becomes a burden, pull that rifle out again.  Well, in a month, maybe I'll go upstate and I'll do it again.  Well, dude, you do realize you have a range pretty close to there.  You know what really pissed me off in Newsday?  They gave out my address.  I mean, my name's one thing, but the address is another. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, if you were John or something, I could see him doing that.  What's someone going to do to show up in Hashtag?  You own an AK-47.  He owned.  He'll get it back.  It's really SLR-90.  It's made in Bulgaria.  At least the whole neighborhood knows you.  Yeah, you're armed.  I don't think he'll screw himself.  That's not your only weapon, is it?  Well, I got a sword on order and I got crossbows and compound bows.  You have any other rifles?  No.  Are you just saying that?  You got a pistol? 
[00:31:30]  No, I'd like to get one, but I don't think I'm ever going to get one.  Yeah, now it's going to be a little hard to fill out that pistol permit.  A little bit.  You've been arrested, yeah, for firing a weapon.  Oh, right.  For firing, yeah.  That guy sounds like Colin Quinn, doesn't he?  You know, guns, cops.  I got to give a shout-out to the Self-Counted Cops.  They were really cool.  And Officer Jeff, and I know he's listening, he's the man.  I agree.  He's like, I'll get you out of here as soon as possible.  That's cool, man.  Hey, are you an OzFest fan?  What's that?  You like OzFest? 
[00:32:00]  OzFest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want a few tickets to OzFest?  That would be beautiful.  Randall's Island, July 29th.  You got at least a pair.  Maybe we'll give you a couple pairs.  Randall's, Rikers, you'll go to one of them.  Wait, isn't that the one, is Ozzy headlining the small stage in that one?  He must.  I'm dying to go to that one.  I'm so annoyed that I'm a women national.  Ozzy's on the second stage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's an intimate setting, dude.  That's the one I want to go to.  I'm so annoyed I can't.  All right, Mr. Oll, we got some tickets for OzFest for you for the New York show, okay?  I don't even think he's got to hold on. 
[00:32:30]  We got your address in the paper.  We'll just mail him to you.  Okay.  No, hold on.  We got to get a little info from you.  All right, thank you.  Talk to you soon, convict.  Thanks for taking the hit for the show, man.  Nice.  Am I really on the front page or something?  Not the front.  Well, I don't know.  Daily News, you almost made the front page.  Yeah, but you're in Newsday.  You're in every newspaper in America except for the New York Post.  And in 15 minutes, you're going to be out of the story on Fox or turn on Fox TV.  I just called my mom.  She's like, you've got to be kidding me. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, the New York Post blew off the story.  Every newspaper in America picked up on it except for the New York Post because they would  have to talk about us and they don't like doing that.  They hate the show.  They hate the show.  So, all right, Mr. Old, hold on the line for your OzFest tickets, all right?  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, bro.  There he goes.  That's it.  He got arrested for the show yesterday.  He thinks he sits around going, I don't want to be Mr. Old, but you've got to be Mr.  Old.  You're Mr. Old.  Why do I got to be Mr. Old?  Because we've got 500 Mr. Youngs running around shooting willy-nilly.  Mr. Middle Age is on another job. 
[00:33:30]  Viola.  All right, fine.  I'm Mr. Old.  What's the big deal?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you, miss.  I called in originally to find out what station y'all were on in Grand Rapids.  Right.  Because I was driving into Grand Rapids.  I'm a truck driver.  Cool.  Meh, meh.  And, uh, lo and behold, you are definitely on in Grand Rapids 107.3. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  WKLQ.  Nice.  I bet you're in traffic and you looked around and you saw people in other cars laughing.  That's how she knew.  Said they must be on.  From car to car to car.  It was just laughter.  Do you have a gun?  All right.  Well, thank you, Viola.  You're welcome.  Enjoy the show.  Enjoy Jimmy's birthday today.  Right.  And enjoy that name.  You're the last one to get that name since 1940.  Viola.  Viola.  I'll tell you the coolest thing. 
[00:34:30]  Yesterday, we were driving on the turnpike and I was, this week, I always get depressed  because it's the Montreal Festival and they never hire me.  And I was complaining to Bonnie and that's why I'm complaining.  I drive by and see a big Opie and Anthony poster with all our names on it, like a billboard.  Oh, yeah.  The coolest thing.  It had everybody's name on it.  Big billboard for the show.  Right on the turnpike.  Turnpike, right?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man.  It's for the ONA Traveling Virus.  Yep.  Comedy show we're doing at the PNC Arts Center on August 26th.  Yeah.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster and all the info is up on Opie  and Anthony.com.  But it's all the comedians you know and love from the show, including Rich Voss. 
[00:35:00]  First one we do is August 5th in Boston, right?  Worcester.  And then we do August 26th, PNC.  And then it's September 9th is the Camden Market, which is the tweeter side, which is  the Philly market.  And then when do we go to Cleveland?  And then Cleveland is September 23rd, just announced.  I think it's going on sale for that show on Saturday through Ticketmaster.  Okay.  But for the New York show, we added Otto and George.  Really?  Yeah, we added Otto and George.  Oh, man.  So that's going to be a lot of fun, too.  We have to tell him no profanity. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, right.  And hopefully we'll be adding more comedians for the Cleveland show especially, maybe some  of the other dates as well.  I want Otto for that show.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, really fast before we take a break, Anthony and I went up to Harlem  to do a photo shoot yesterday.  Man, oh, man, oh, man.  You know, I've been hearing stories that everything is hunky-dory and everything's very nice up  there.  There's a renaissance going on up there. 
[00:36:00]  And that ain't what I saw.  Really?  Instead of going to the movies, take a little ride up to 123rd Street and Lenox Avenue, also  known as MLK Boulevard.  It's the MLK.  And get a little lawn chair and sit there for 10 minutes.  You'll see more stuff than you'll ever see in a movie theater.  Wow.  And this is the funny – how do we even begin this?  Basically, people just don't think behind the scenes, okay?  Every day we do a walkover from this fine facility at Free FM in New York City to our 
[00:36:30]  other show on XM Satellite Radio.  And we do the walkover, we broadcast live, and everyone is so concerned about our safety,  which is nice.  So we got undercover cops, we got Club Soda Kenny, we got the NYPD that just shows up  out of the blue to make sure the boys are okay.  They do all this so we could walk one block in midtown Manhattan with a bunch of suits. 
[00:37:00]  The safest area of Manhattan is where we are.  It's midtown.  It's business people going to work and a few tourists that have strayed out of, like,  Times Square area and stuff like that.  We got people armed, armed, that walk with us every day to make sure we're safe.  Security, ridiculous.  We go on this photo shoot yesterday.  It was set up for, I guess, the Boston Globe.  Yeah, we're going to be in the Sunday pullout or something.  The Sunday magazine section.  They're redoing it, making it new, and I guess we have a big part of that. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know if it's the cover or not.  I heard it was the cover, but we'll see.  I couldn't see, like, doing a photo shoot like this for a little blurb.  You know, the guy comes all the way down here and takes us to Harlem where his idea was,  like, we had one of these liberal photographers, man, where it was like, you know, it's like  an artistic guy, and it's like, yeah, let's go to Harlem where it's gritty and stuff. 
[00:38:00]  You know, the guy just lives in the village.  You guys are the real deal.  So, you know, we want you in a setting that's, like, real and gritty.  We want a gritty, yeah, a gritty set where you're among your people.  Why don't you just do a mansion would be a great place.  Why don't you have to run away in Lebanon?  Yeah, exactly.  I would have felt safer.  We would have felt safer in Lebanon.  I'm not even kidding you.  I'm not even kidding you.  So this guy is all about, you know, we want to shoot you in Harlem. 
[00:38:30]  Shoot you.  Yeah.  Shoot us in Harlem.  At a newsstand or something?  Yeah, it was supposed to be opened.  Right.  For some reason, the guy left early.  Maybe he was a little sleepy.  Left early or he probably fleed.  Or fled.  Fled.  Fled.  He fled.  Fleed.  Jesus.  That's a bad one.  It is.  It isn't quite seven yet, so you have an excuse.  How long were you in Harlem for?  Really, right?  I started talking like the locals.  No, and then he fleed, you know. 
[00:39:00]  He fleed.  I said, boo got shot, boo got shot.  And then he fleed.  Trees were running everywhere up in this.  Give me boo got shot now.  See?  Oh, man.  The beauty of me not speaking well, it turns into bits.  That's right.  Yeah.  The guy fled.  He probably thought it was a good place to have a business and realized quickly that it  wasn't.  So this newsstand that was supposed to be open was burnt out and locked up with chains.  Yeah, the big grating was in front of it. 
[00:39:30]  The guy's not doing business anymore there.  But this photographer who's all that, he's a liberal dude from NYU probably, man.  Man, we're going to take some pictures in Harlem.  In Harlem.  Real gritty.  So XM thinks nothing of it.  They don't think we really would need security in Harlem.  We need security to walk a block in midtown Manhattan among the suits.  But to go up to Harlem, the boys will be fine.  Everywhere else we go. 
[00:40:00]  Wherever we go, we have security because they're paranoid like that.  I'm constantly going, stay here.  I'm walking to my car.  I'm fine.  Leave me alone.  I want to be alone.  There are times I just want to walk alone.  I want to be alone.  I want to be alone.  Why am I alone?  But they didn't have security for you guys going to Harlem?  No.  Who set this photo shoot up?  It was XM.  Was it?  Was it?  You got to call out XM on this.  You got to have security to go to Harlem.  Should be security.  And there's someone that I even apologized to. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not even going to say her name, but I apologized to her for the attitude we had because we were like, whatever.  It wasn't an attitude.  It was, it was primal fear that I had pumping through me.  Yeah, but you could get away with it, Auntie, up there.  I mean, you're horrible, frizzy hair, but Opie, I mean, could you be lighter?  Let me tell you something, Mr. Darker than anyone I've ever seen in my life, Jew, you might be able to get away with it.  No, you couldn't even get away with it. 
[00:41:00]  I'm talking, this was the real deal.  There were no white people.  What was the address?  What was the cross streets?  It was the exact place was 122nd and Lenox, which is Martin Luther King Boulevard.  Yeah.  So I'm running late.  Oh, oh, we forgot to tell you.  Obviously, we're going to stick out like a sore thumb.  So why don't we really stick out like a sore thumb and go up there in a limo?  They arrange a stretch limo for me, my girlfriend, Opie, his girlfriend, and what I thought was Kenny. 
[00:41:30]  Because I got an email.  Here's something that happened.  I got an email from XM that said, you two will have cars or a car or something.  It was a little too vague.  So I said, look, the girls are coming with us.  And is Kenny going or some kind of security?  Because then we need a bigger car or two town cars.  Right.  So she said, it'll all be arranged.  So it turned out to be one stretch limo. 
[00:42:00]  Now, Opie had stuff to do beforehand.  So he wasn't even in the limo.  I took a cab and I forgot to tell you this part of it.  You know, the cab pulls up in my neighborhood.  I went back to my place that I can't live in anymore to get some stuff.  I get to get my clothes for the next couple of days because for Grand Rapids, I'm homeless  and I'm living in a freaking hotel.  So the cab pulls over.  And a lot of these guys in New York, especially around that time, they're like, where are you  going?  Because they don't want to get stuck in traffic.  They want to make as much money as possible.  Yeah.  And if you tell them you're going somewhere they don't like, they take off. 
[00:42:30]  They don't even say no.  So he goes, where are you going?  I go, 123rd in Lenox.  He starts to pull away.  I'm like, hey, hey, hey.  I'm like, come on.  The cabbie didn't want to go up there.  I go, I go.  They never do.  I go, bro, I'll make it worth your while.  Throw in a little extra.  He goes, all right, get in.  He didn't want to go up there.  And this is daylight in the afternoon.  Also, the armor plating like the Batmobile starts coming up over the cab.  Right.  And he lives there.  Because he figured he wouldn't be able to get anybody coming back down. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  He's not getting a return trip.  Right.  He just didn't want anything to do with that area.  No.  So I was able to get the cabbie to drive me up there.  On my way, Anthony calls me.  And you were losing your mind.  I was like.  A lot of people expect me to lose my mind, obviously.  But it's great when Anthony loses his mind because it's a little more real.  Oh, but it just goes, hello?  Because he's a little more rational than me.  I go, dude, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You said this.  I feel like it's my first day in prison.  I really did.  You said it was the scariest place you've ever been. 
[00:43:30]  Scariest place I've ever been.  And this is in the daylight.  Daytime.  It was one of those situations where people are walking around.  You are the complete minority.  Yeah.  There are no other white people.  Not a hint of white.  There are people sitting around like there was a strip store where it was a fried chicken place, a liquor store, a beauty parlor, and then a grocery, a small grocery store.  It's like everything you need.  Everything you need is right there. 
[00:44:00]  And then people set up chairs and just sit around and talk loudly to each other until like gunfire starts, I guess.  You could be pals.  You always hear about this.  Two friends were arguing about cigarettes and gunfire started.  And that's all I was thinking.  And we're sitting in front of a stoop of a building in a limo.  And then a couple of people start like coming around the limo looking through the windshield to see who's in there.  And one of the guys goes, hey, who in there?  To the driver.  And I go, just don't say like 50 cent or something because I get all his friends. 
[00:44:30]  We should have just with a helmet.  Hey, it's fitting.  It's fitting.  Hey, it's Puff Daddy.  The whole limo just gets surrounded, waiting, and Whitey pops out.  Did you notice there were no cars driving down the road?  No.  No cars were driving down the road.  You forgot about the burnt out buildings.  You forgot about the fire hydrant.  Yeah, the open up hydrant.  The locals opened up to cool off because it is a heat wave here in New York City. 
[00:45:00]  And then we saw this crackhead walk by the fire hydrant, and he had this plaid, dirty plaid suit on with like a fedora that matched his plaid suit.  It was hysterical.  And he's staggering down the road because he's kind of drunk.  And he starts drinking out of the fire hydrant.  It's spraying him in the face.  Like, it's like drinking out of a fire hose, and this guy is trying to like drink out of it.  Another guy then comes walking by, and he's got a cane, and he's got five bullet shots in his calf. 
[00:45:30]  Like, you bullet wounds in his calf, and he's like gimping along.  Jimmy, it was the real deal, yes.  And I'm just like, oh my God.  So I'm not leaving.  The photographer comes over to the limo.  I roll the window down a crack, and he's like, hey, what's up?  He gives his name, and I was like, wait, just waiting for Opie to get here.  Just wait.  And he goes, okay, we're set up over there.  I'm like, yeah, and I'm going to set up in here until Opie comes, which I will then leave, take the pictures with Opie, back in the car, get the hell out of there. 
[00:46:00]  They wanted a gritty shot of you two in your element, and they're going to get like two cowards hiding behind something, cringing while the locals attack.  It's going to be gazelles at the watering hole surrounded by lions.  The picture's going to be great because we were so pissed off that he got exactly what he wanted.  I think he did get what he wanted.  He didn't get any smiles or nothing.  So when I talked to Anthony from the cab, I called Elo, poor Elo, because he's got enough on his plate, and I just blast him. 
[00:46:30]  I'm like, dude, who approved this?  Who is the dummy that thinks this isn't a good idea without any security or anything?  But somebody brought up Kenny and said Kenny should have been there.  And I was like, this is a situation where Kenny would end up.  You ever see those segments in some of the RoboCop movies where he's disassembled and just kind of twitching like his arm is going and his leg is somewhere laying over there?  I go, that would be Kenny.  He would just be overpowered.  Well, I just want to apologize to you because, you know, the last thing I want to do is let you guys down. 
[00:47:00]  You didn't.  But I had absolutely no clue.  Were you Kreskin?  You should have read our minds.  No, but I just, you know, I always insist that they treat you guys the way you should be treated, and I'm just infuriated that this happened.  The logic doesn't make sense.  I mean, you know, it's like let's make sure the boys are safe every day for the walkover, but when it comes to going to Harlem in a limo, they should be fine.  That's why I don't want to even deal with most people down in Washington anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  They're on a much lower level than us.  They just don't have the brain power to understand, to understand what we're about, what the show's about.  What we're about.  That we're frightened of black people.  And nobody is bothering Kenny in Harlem.  Nobody's bothering him.  No, no.  That big, frightening white guy.  Everybody knows.  You can't not know Kenny is a cop or used to be a cop.  I didn't know the pulled pants down thing was still, like, a thing.  I saw just all, every guy that was walking around had the jeans pulled down, I mean completely down to where your buttocks meets your thigh. 
[00:48:00]  And you're under, you're walking around pretty much in your underwear with just your butt hanging out.  Well, if you want to proof that pants are down, go see Norton in a rest area.  Nothing on that one.  Okay.  It's hurtful.  That's why.  At a boy-o.  And it's his birthday.  Because you made fun of the birthday boy.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  So, most photo shoots take a minimum of an hour. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  We were there sitting on whatever they had out, I think a milk crate in a chair or something.  A milk crate in a chair, sitting there, kind of leaning forward on our own, like, our elbows on our legs.  Right.  And kind of just looking into the camera, like, get me the...  Oh, we gave him a look at death like, you ass.  Hurry up, you got five minutes.  Snap away, jack it.  And then he decided for the last shot to get all the...  The locals.  Get the flavor of the neighborhood.  Hey, you guys want to jump in?  And of course they want to jump in.  So, they jump in behind us. 
[00:49:00]  They want to jump in.  They want to jump on.  They want to...  But I bet you...  I bet you...  Because Harlem is not as bad.  I bet it come places.  I bet the pictures come out pretty cool.  No, trust me.  This part of Harlem, because I hear how it's changing and Whitey's moving in and Magic Johnson's getting involved.  AIDS?  And Clinton's getting involved.  Not in this area.  No, no.  It hasn't hit this area yet.  I don't even mean where they've fixed up.  I'm saying, just as a rule, I think Harlem's reputation is worse.  Like, there's places in Brooklyn I would never go to.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[00:49:30]  But I think Harlem is a lot less scary than a lot of other places in here.  Yeah, but you're talking about, you know, less scary than Beirut and Baghdad.  But I bet nobody bothered you, right?  Like, everybody was okay?  Yeah.  We weren't there long enough.  We weren't there long enough.  Our photo shoot, it should take an hour minimum.  It took five minutes.  Dropped into the LZ.  Dusted off in no time.  We were out of there.  Five minutes.  Tire tracks from the limo.  We're out.  A limo? 
[00:50:00]  How stupid are these people in Washington?  Do I have to spell it out for you?  It's bad enough you want us in Harlem without security, and then you get us a limo.  Who in there?  First of all, I effing hate limos.  Don't like them whatsoever.  I would have had no problem taking a cab up there.  Well, then we wouldn't have got a cab home, I guess.  But, well, maybe a car that was a little less limo-like.  Conspicuous.  Exactly.  That might have saved you from a problem, though, because it was just intriguing enough to keep people from bricking you. 
[00:50:30]  Keep them distracted.  Who are these two white guys in this neighborhood with a limo?  They're obviously very flashy.  They're not hiding.  What's going on?  I'm trying to get the pictures for the website.  We should have them.  We should have them within a day or two.  Let's say hi to Malik.  Malik.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  What's up, man?  Yo, Jimmy.  Happy degree day, homie.  Oh, thank you, Malik.  Yeah, listen.  Yo, I'm from Brownsville, but I'm in the Asbury Park now.  But listen.  Y'all was that on 1-22nd?  Yeah.  Cassie getting bodied up there.  I don't even go up there. 
[00:51:00]  Nah, huh?  So it was a good thing that y'all made way and got up out of there real quick because,  yeah, it's starting to become diverse, but it's not one of the type of places that you  two want to be mingling in.  You know what I'm saying?  Nah, the apartments that were, like, blown up and burnt out, that was a little disconcerting.  Yeah.  Yeah, but look at it like this.  You guys could become bludged then, you know?  But aren't they, like, standing out, like, such a, it's such an obvious place they don't  belong.  It's almost, it's going to get you in less trouble because you're so obviously don't 
[00:51:30]  belong there.  Yeah.  There's something that people are going to look like, what are these two idiots doing?  Yeah, like the black guys that Fat Nick hit.  So obviously don't belong there.  Well, you guys weren't, yeah, like, you're supposed to be copping drugs or something  there, you know what I mean?  You don't belong there.  Yeah.  That's true.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, man.  Peace.  Listen, we got to take a break.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  Rich Voss is in the house, in the high house.  I want to hug Kevin Smith.  I love him after reading this.  I love him.  Is he here?  All right.  Hold him.  Kevin Smith from Clerks 2 will be in studio in minutes, and there's a lot going on with him 
[00:52:00]  and the movie.  He made page six of the post today.  His blog about the incident is hilarious.  We're going to get into that in just a bit.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker, visit opiananthony.com.  Wow stands for whip him out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, whip him out whenever.  It's going to be whip him out any time, but that's not wow.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  One of these days you'd be driving.  A girl that's familiar with the program is going to see the wow, know what it means, pull  up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.  So there you have it.  Whip him out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got lots going on today.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  For the walkover today, everyone that joins us will, I was going to say win, but you'll  get a Jimmy Day t-shirt.  Also, it's whip him out Wednesday. 
[00:53:00]  Make sure you get the wows on your cars and your trucks and your bicycles and your motor  scooters.  We love wow.  We've been doing wow for many, many years, and it's still working great.  Hopefully, the station you're listening to us on will get your wow stickers.  Hopefully, they'll explain it.  Maybe on their website or something.  But basically, you get a wow in your car, and there's girls out there that will flash  you as you're driving around town.  Yeah, they see the wow and know what it means. 
[00:53:30]  And they pull up, and you'll be sitting in traffic or driving somewhere.  And then you look over, and a girl will be flashing you, and you go, what the fuck?  And then you realize, oh, yeah, it's that stupid wow sticker I got on my car.  Yeah, just don't harass the ladies.  There's plenty of them out there that'll do it on their own.  O&A Traveling Virus, the comedy tour thing.  It's going to be a lot of wowing going on at that event as well.  Kevin Smith from Clerks 2 is going to be joining the program, I guess, a little later on.  But right now, an old friend.  We met him when he was doing I Bet You Will. 
[00:54:00]  It was called I Bet You Will, right?  That's right, yeah.  Old school.  Wow, yeah, that is a while ago.  He came in, no one really knew who you were.  You were doing this for MTV, I think, at the time, right?  Yeah, well, first we were on the Internet, and then MTV bought the show.  That Internet thing.  Oh, it was back there in World Wide Web.  It turned out to be a fad.  It was all a fad.  Yeah, but it was one of the first Internet shows, though.  Yeah, we actually made it to television.  It was a miracle.  Right, yeah.  From the Internet to television?  That's right, yeah.  We're, of course, saying hi to Morgan Spurlock.  And then he went on to become huge with Super Size Me. 
[00:54:30]  No pun intended.  Yeah.  Wow, you have slimmed down.  Yeah, my wife cleaned me out.  My now wife.  How long did it take you?  Because I'm trying to, like, lose weight, exercise, and it's like...  You look good, man.  Oh, thank you.  Don't let anybody lie to you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'm on shave.  I have an audition.  I'm watching.  That's why I'm looking sloppy.  My little blubber gut.  I still pinch it.  It won't go away.  I'm, like, I'm doing sit-ups and crunches, and I'm punching the heavy bag.  Let me see you pinch it again, because it's... 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  Yeah, but you...  Let me tell you something.  You lost a lot of weight.  Thank you.  I'm telling you, you really did.  Thank you.  But he said that he...  To get rid of, like, the last...  Like, for me, it's, you know, eight inches.  It took me 14 months to lose all the weight.  It took a long time.  14 months.  14 months.  And how long did it take to put it on?  A month.  One month.  30 days.  14 months.  Wow.  It's so unfair.  Yeah, that's super...  It's not even fair.  That supersized me movie was...  It was great.  I was thinking when the cameras...  We talked about this on the show.  When the cameras were off, you were sneaking a few more... 
[00:55:30]  A few more Big Macs, or...  Is it Big Macs for McDonald's?  I don't know.  I don't even know.  Who...  It's the Big Macs.  That you were sneaking just a few more just to get the weight up a little bit  and get the cholesterol levels up a little higher.  Oh, shit.  To be a little more dramatic.  I was just shooting it straight into my veins.  You know?  I was just laying on the couch late at night in the baseline.  Priolator grease.  Dude, you...  Just pumping it in.  You made the best point in Supersize Me about how people are so comfortable criticizing  smokers.  Yeah.  Like, at a table.  Like, why are you smoking? 
[00:56:00]  Why don't you say that to somebody who's 300 pounds eating, eating, eating bad?  It's like, you know, if we're going to sit next to somebody on a plane, it's going  to be inconvenient.  It's not very...  Why is one addiction okay to attack, but not another?  It's the same as with kids.  I think it's child abuse.  When your kids are, like, 200 pounds and they're five years old, you wouldn't  feed them alcohol or drugs, but don't force feed them horrible food.  No, one of my favorite things when we were shooting Supersize Me, we were shooting in  the middle of Texas and it's 9 a.m. and I'm in there getting some breakfast and there's  a mom who's in there with her kids and they've just finished breakfast and they're having  hot fudge sundaes.  And I'm like, dude, it's 9 in the morning. 
[00:56:30]  What are you doing?  And the kids were...  Oh, but they'll be quick to say, it's a disease.  It's a disease.  Yes.  This is called, you should kill yourself, Itis.  All I had was a salad.  I can't help myself.  It's a disease.  It's hot fudge sundaes.  Look it up.  It's a disease.  I have a disorder.  They tell you what they ate for the whole day.  It's like, what do you eat on a general, regular day?  What do you...  Well, I have a salad for lunch.  I skip breakfast and then dinner. 
[00:57:00]  It's a very small piece of turkey.  It's always turkey.  A little small piece of turkey.  And then before bed, I might have a little snack of a rhinoceros.  They never, ever fess up to the fact that you're shoving...  ...cake and Entenmann's and everything else down their throats.  Oh, that's just terrific.  I like cake as much as the next little boy.  You certainly do.  But I went and bought some fat-free yogurt and I put fruit in it and a little bit of granola. 
[00:57:30]  And that's what I have instead of cake.  You can't even trust that anymore.  Like people that say something's fat-free.  Yeah.  Like somebody that knows.  Like I'll look at something and go, oh, that's fat-free.  And then somebody that knows turns it around and goes, no, because if you look at the numbers here,  it's this type of fat, which even though it says it's only this much, it actually means  it's as much as this.  It's got trans fat.  Trans fat.  Corn syrup.  Look at the corn syrup.  Yeah, yeah.  Who cares about that trans fat?  You lift it up.  Oh, look.  Look what's under the skirt.  It is trans fat.  I didn't think it was fat. 
[00:58:00]  Next thing you know, it slapped me in the chin.  Oh, well.  All you're here to get your money's worth.  LOL.  Hey, Morgan, I got two questions about the movie and then we'll move on.  First of all, did McDonald's try to assassinate you?  Is that a rumor?  Yeah, I kept waiting to see like the clown around the corner.  I'm not even kidding because, man, you made them look really, really bad.  Yeah.  And then the second question is.  Ronald, you have the shot.  Take the shot.  Take the shot.  And then the second question is, how did you get away with making a movie? 
[00:58:30]  Just because it's a documentary, you could slander a company like that?  Yeah, well, I mean, well, the thing was we did more research.  I read more law making this film than I'd ever read.  I'd imagine.  Without being incarcerated, I read more law than I thought I'd ever read.  And everything we could do was all within our rights legally.  So it was a risk.  But, you know, we said, roll the dice.  And they didn't try?  They didn't try.  No, not in the United States.  I guess they didn't want it to be an attention getter.  An attention getter.  That's an attention getter.  And then the movie blew up and McDonald's could not be happy.  Yeah.  When did you start hating McDonald's as far as eating the food every day? 
[00:59:00]  What day in?  Probably by like day 10, I was so done.  Because we all like to go to McDonald's from time to time.  But when you're eating it every day, it has to hit a point where you're like, I can't eat this anymore.  But to this day, it's like if I smell a Big Mac, you know, my mouth starts watering like Pavlov's dog.  It's totally McCrack.  You know, it's like I just can't stop.  I think most people can eat it in moderation.  I mean, you have your normal dinners and everything.  But every so often, I think if you just go in and grab a burger or something, it's fine. 
[00:59:30]  It's these people that just make it a lifestyle.  But people say, no, no, I eat it in moderation.  I only have it once a week.  Yeah, once a week.  And I can't eat once a week.  And I have Burger King once a week.  I have Taco Bell once a week.  And I have all the same stuff.  Yeah, all the same stuff.  Punched out of a different mold.  When you gained weight with your blonde hair, did you attract a lot of black men?  Goddamn boss.  I still do. 
[01:00:00]  Congratulations on your marriage, by the way.  A lot of people checking in.  You got married in Fiji?  We did, yeah.  We got out of Dodge.  We sent out an email, dude.  We did the right thing.  In February, we sent out the email and said, by the way, we're getting married here.  If you want to come, good luck.  Yeah, that's kind of a good way to keep family and friends away.  I had one friend.  I had one friend come and his wife, and that was it.  That's pretty cool.  That's the way to do it.  I could be getting out.  I got married in New York, and a lot of my friends didn't show up. 
[01:00:30]  You got married more than Canada, you horse's ass.  That's true, you idiot.  You're lying.  I was his best man, and I honestly was trying to think of how I got out of it.  How do I not show up for this stupid thing?  It's like, why get married in the Arctic Circle?  No.  We're going to tell you how awful our friend is.  He gets mad at us because we don't go to his bachelor party.  Was that a comedy club?  No, it was a wedding reception.  Oh, a wedding reception.  Even worse.  I thought he was just inviting some of his friends to the comedy club. 
[01:01:00]  If you can make it, all right.  If you can't, whatever.  No, it was his wedding reception.  We find out after the fact.  He had a little red carpet outside Caroline's here in New York.  I heard it looked like, I heard the red carpet looked like what you put in front of your  shower, like when you step out on it.  Like a mat.  Yeah, it was a red mat.  It had stickies underneath the side of it, so it didn't really slip in the water.  They each had one foot on the red carpet, one foot on the real sidewalk.  And he's killing us to this day because we didn't show up. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, because we thought it was just kind of a casual hang, like we got married, we're  going to get together a little bit at the comedy club.  Well, you guys don't care.  But it was his official wedding reception.  I don't care less.  It was on a weekday.  On a weekday.  It was late.  We do morning radio.  We got to get up at four o'clock in the morning and we're supposed to hang out at ten o'clock  it was or something.  Yeah, it was a little late.  It was a show before our party.  Of course there was.  Got to pay for that ring somehow. 
[01:02:00]  I bought that at a 12-step meeting.  A 12-step ring.  You don't know how many quarters it took to get that out of the machine.  The crane had to pick it up and drop it in a little hole.  No, no, no.  Voss is far more despicable than that would have been.  That would have been just cheap.  He's cheap and despicable.  He goes to these...  It was a 12-step meeting.  And the guy going, did you get married?  He goes, no, I called it off.  I go, well, you got to sell the ring.  You got to let go.  You got to sell the ring.  You talked this guy out of his...  Well, his girl relapsed.  He called off the engagement.  He had the ring. 
[01:02:30]  What's he going to do with it?  So I went home, got DVD money out of the safe, and I went to a Best Western, and I gave  it to Bonnie at the Best Western.  It's a true story.  He's about as romantic as a Dominican home invasion.  He asked her at a Best Western to marry him.  What an ass.  All right, let's say hi to Christina.  Christina in Connecticut.  Christina.  Hi, boys.  Hi.  Hi.  I just want to say quickly that Morgan Spurlock has the best show on television. 
[01:03:00]  You're talking about 30 days?  I love 30 days.  Thank you.  Which episode did you like?  The gay one.  That is my favorite.  Who doesn't?  What was the gay one?  You want me to say?  Of course.  Why not?  We're talking here for the kids.  Contribute.  Pretty much, they had this really, I guess, right-wing young guy.  I think, was he in the military or something?  Yeah, he was an Army Reservist.  Right, and they put him in the gayest neighborhood forever, I'm guessing, Castro in San Francisco. 
[01:03:30]  And wackiness ensued.  Yeah.  So basically, you lived as a gay guy for 30 days?  Yeah, he moved in.  He moved in to see what it's like to be gay in America for 30 days.  I think just living there doesn't really get the point across, but okay.  It kind of, you know, the lifestyle as far as where you live.  Did he really get into his role?  Well, yeah, I mean, he was working in a cheese shop and was assimilating into his neighborhood 
[01:04:00]  and going to support group meetings with people who were estranged from their families, and he was feeling it.  Did he try out any, you know, a little kissing or anything?  Nothing like that?  Just a little off camera.  Check it out?  Yeah.  A little tap on the bottom?  No, he didn't.  Did it change him at all, though?  Did it change his point of view at all?  I mean, by the end, by the end, I mean, it totally, you know, I think Millie really made him, you know, not look at these people as like those people.  You know, he kind of saw that they were actually like real living individuals. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That at least is something.  Yeah.  I'm sure he just went back and probably wore off quickly.  Yeah.  I'm going to clean my guns now.  Yeah.  I'm going to clean my guns.  And you did 30 days in jail.  Is that?  Yeah, this season.  Yeah, for this season of 30 days.  You should explain 30 days to people that might not have heard about this show.  It's a great concept.  Yeah, we're all right on things.  So the idea of the show is we try and, you know, examine different kind of social issues in the United States by putting someone in an environment that's a little different from their own life for 30 days. 
[01:05:00]  And in my episode this year, I go to jail for 30 days to see what it's like to, you know, be a girl.  You only do one episode?  I only do one episode a year, yeah, because it's so massive.  I mean, it takes forever to produce this show.  Oh, good point.  Yeah, you've got to do it for 30 days.  It's on FX on Wednesday nights at 10 o'clock.  How much were you really treated like a convict?  Well, you know, I got shanked.  There you go.  Did you go to a prison or to a county?  I went to a county.  In where?  This is in Rico County, Virginia, in Richmond, Virginia.  Counties could be tougher than prisons, they say, right? 
[01:05:30]  Will you stop trying to act like you know what you're talking about?  You've never been to jail.  I've read a lot of books.  Oh, what a dope.  You don't read books.  I wish Bonnie was here just to explain what happened.  Did you hear what he just did, though?  He goes, did you go to county or prison?  And he goes, if he would have said prison, Dummy would have said, dude, that's the worst  place to go.  Worst place to go.  County.  I've been in prison.  First of all, let me tell you something, okay?  30 days.  Here's the thing.  I read The Hot House.  I read The Hot House. 
[01:06:00]  You did.  I watched every episode of Oz.  I got all seasons on DVD.  I read tons of prison books, okay?  I know about prisons.  You don't have to do something to know about something.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you see Caged Heat?  I watched Caged Heat.  I watched Caged Heat.  Innocent Man, I saw.  Dude, I saw Oz, too, and then I got arrested.  I was looking for the guy in the wheelchair hanging upside down and spinning in a circle.  That's a bad example.  Shawshank.  Yeah.  Birdman of Alcatraz so many times. 
[01:06:30]  I watched Escape from Alcatraz.  It was great.  Remember Clint Eastwood's cheeks when he first walks into jail naked?  What a solid backside.  The only guy with a nicer ass is the murderer in 10 to midnight.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  But he's running down the street.  What do you use this for?  I'll be back.  Oh, no, you won't.  Nicer cheeks.  And I spent time in jail, okay, pal?  Did you?  You didn't?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Overnight in Plainfield.  I even burned my name in the ceiling. 
[01:07:00]  All right?  Oh, wow.  What a tough guy.  Wow.  That's how you win friends and influence people.  He carved his time in one.  All right, Voss.  You're out.  Your $10 bail has been made.  Leaves the place crying like a little baby.  Next time, use your blinker.  The only thing we can hope for is a Voss was here carving in a beam with a noose on it. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, you ass.  I love it.  So you were in prison.  Voss is jail story.  Yeah.  So you were in prison.  I do a show.  It's called one day.  Hey, are you doing comedy today for Jimmy's birthday?  Where?  On the street, like you do.  On the walkover.  I'll do a tour.  We can go back to the original Starbucks.  I don't mind.  I'll do a set.  Maybe we just do it on the corner.  No, I'll die on the corner. 
[01:08:00]  Not like I haven't died in every other...  He's done so well.  We take him around and just, like, we'll walk into a Starbucks.  Big, dopey Kenny will announce Rich Voss, but we'll then start doing his filth-ridden stand-up.  Hey, it's great to be back here on 53rd Street.  Yeah, and just, like, horrible, racist, sexist humor that people are just shocked.  You know, these, like, old liberal types in the Starbucks reading and typing away on the computer,  and Voss just with awful black jokes, and you're just a despicable person. 
[01:08:30]  I was walking from where I parked my car, and I had time to kill it, and I wanted to go eat,  and I start to walk in to pick a bagel, and I go, wait, how is my set here?  And I blew it off.  Yeah, you did, like...  Because I was calling the guy, Diara, behind the counter, you know,  smell his fingers for gunpowder or something.  Unbelievable.  And this, by the way, I was reading some of this.  They said you guys did tremendous...  In fact, you guys did tremendously well.  Every week, like, people are watching the show. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, the show did really good last year, and so it premieres next Wednesday.  Yeah, have you taken the latitude they give you with language and stuff to the extreme?  Because I know that FX allows you a lot more than...  I curse every other word in the show.  Really? Do you? That's great.  Did the prisoners know you were in jail?  Like, doing a TV show?  Well, they followed me and five other inmates in when I got processed,  so they thought we were just shooting a documentary about a bunch of different people.  Oh, that's a good way to do it, instead of just the cameras on you.  Hey, why are they taping this guy, so... 
[01:09:30]  Why were you in prison?  What was the excuse you were giving?  I got convicted for contempt of court.  Contempt of court?  Oh, you kept it safe.  Contempt of court, yeah.  No child crimes, right?  Yeah, I'm sure there was a meeting like,  well, if I say this, then these people are going to be mad at me.  Yeah, all right, we've got to keep it very safe here.  Yeah, they found something on his hard drive.  Yeah, you really...  Suddenly, they go, the papers get mixed up, and they go,  Rape, we're going to put you in with these fellas.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  What are you here for 10 gigabytes?  I bought Gary Glitter's computer, and they found it.  In Virginia, like, did they try to get you to join, like, the Aryans?  Or, like, what does a guy that's a regular guy in prison do  if he's not part of a gang or something?  Yeah, you fit in, like, the Aryan Nation kind of thing.  Yeah, it was incredible.  There were a bunch of skinheads that were in there, you know,  and so, yeah, this...  Got a swastika on your chest?  On my back.  American History X?  Yeah, right under the breasts.  Then I got tattooed on my back.  Anyone approach you, though, to hook up with a... 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, because it's not as polarized in, like, a jail, I think,  as it is in a full-on federal prison, but...  Boss, is it?  No, sir.  Shut up.  Stupid ass.  This thing in county, you'll share a cell with more than one person.  That's exactly right.  Like, when we checked into this, when I first, when I checked in, like...  Checked in.  Checked in.  Is there a concierge service here, please?  Because is my sexual assault ready?  You know, I was in a cell with four guys when I first got there. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, so it was sexy right from the start.  It was sexy right from the start.  I was sleeping on the floor next to the metal toilet.  Oh.  It was paradise.  Did any of them recognize you?  Not very many.  Like, there was, like, one or two guys.  Not a lot of doc watchers.  Had to kill him.  Yeah.  To make the show work.  Exactly.  I know you.  You're from...  Shank him with your toothbrush.  He's staggering around like...  Like, what's his...  Oh, I can't remember the guy's name from Scarface.  But he's walking with the wound in his fat little stomach. 
[01:11:30]  If you...  If you...  Now, did you tell the camera crew if I'm getting raped, really not film this?  Yeah.  Like...  Zoom in on my face.  That's...  Help me out.  Get a close-up.  Right.  Get the reaction.  Yeah.  Did you have a safe word?  Like, the guy, you know, stop, stop.  And they're still filming.  Right.  Help me, cameraman.  No, you said.  Whatever happens, just take it.  Yellow flowers.  All right.  Get the cards.  What are some of the other episodes for season two?  I see you're going to do something on immigration.  Yeah.  The season premiere is great, which is the show that actually kicks off the season on Wednesday. 
[01:12:00]  We took a border-patrolling minute man who happens to be, like, a legal Cuban immigrant.  He's a Latino who came to the country legally.  Moves in with a family of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles.  Oh.  They think he's, like, a sellout or, like, kind of turning out to old people?  Oh, my gosh, dude.  They were so unhappy that...  Because first, they thought some, like, crazy, gun-toting white guy was going to show up.  And so when a Cuban guy walks in, they're livid, you know?  But he went through all the process of becoming a citizen.  Yeah.  And so he's got some resentment towards people that just come in and... 
[01:12:30]  And just come into the country.  He says, you know, you guys are destroying America.  You're destroying my country.  I already had one country get stolen.  I'm not going to lose another one.  Wow.  Yeah, it's intense, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then other ones this season, outsourcing, atheists versus being Christian or something  like that?  Yeah, an atheist moves in with a Christian family.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I'm sure they convert each other day one.  That religious thing.  They're all singing Kumbaya.  Yeah.  I'm sure that works out well.  Well, it's a great show. 
[01:13:00]  Great concept.  Except, you know, congrats, Morgan.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, you're just blowing up.  It's on FX every Wednesday night starting July 26th at 10 p.m.  Which is this coming Wednesday.  It's called 30 Days.  Yeah, it's coming Wednesday.  I have an idea for a show.  Put me in a house with people that can pronounce C-H's.  And this is what bugs me about Voss saying I read.  We were talking about the Kevin Smith thing, and I show him in the paper where it is on  page six.  And he comes over, and he realizes that reading is required.  And he looks at it, and he just kind of shakes his head no and walks away. 
[01:13:30]  No.  That was what you did on the break, you dope.  You saw words.  He wanted a picture that explained everything.  It was a photo essay.  You don't need none of that fancy book learning on the show.  First of all, Pete, I didn't have my glasses, so I can't really see it.  That's the only reason.  I've never seen you in glasses.  No, to read, because you've never seen me read.  Yeah.  What a defense.  That really helped out, Rich.  I stand corrected.  That really helped you out there.  Well, you know what I mean.  I've never seen you in glasses. 
[01:14:00]  I don't wear glasses.  When I read, I wear glasses.  I bought the owl.  I want to see you in glasses.  He takes them out to read the menus.  I've seen you take them out to read the menu.  Yeah.  You look ridiculous.  You look stupid in glasses.  Oh, my God.  Please bring them in next time.  Some people look smart when they put glasses on.  You can read the paper and the future.  We've got to take a break.  We're really late.  Morgan, thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  It's 30 days.  It's on.  This Wednesday, FX.  No, no, next Wednesday, the 26th.  A week from today on FX, 10 p.m. 
[01:14:30]  There you go.  I made a mistake.  It's called 30 days.  It's your birthday.  When we get back, we talk to Kevin Smith about all the controversy around his movie Clerks 2.  Good friend of the show.  The movie's great.  We'll talk to him next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  It's Jimmy Day, a celebration honoring one of the world's most attractive.  My mule looks fantastic.  Thoughtful.  You have the timing of a stroke on Christmas Eve.  Insightful.  Whatever.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  All inspiring people. 
[01:15:00]  I hope the last thing you hear before you drunk drive into a wall is my stupid voice.  Jim Norton.  Just shut up.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock and roll.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  It's Jim's birthday.  Jim Norton's birthday today.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  And during the walkover, we're going to be giving away Jimmy Day t-shirts that we were supposed to give away about a month ago. 
[01:15:30]  So join us for the walkover today.  Everyone gets a Jimmy Day t-shirt today, okay?  Hey, a little update.  Power saw survivor guy is on the Today Show.  Matt Lauer's interviewing him.  Only in New York.  I love it, man.  We got a hell of a city here.  This guy is a little postal worker.  He's down in the subway just mining his own beeswax.  And some homeless guy grabs two sawzalls, battery-powered sawzalls, fires them up from the workers that were not paying attention to their power tools, 
[01:16:00]  fires them up and charges at this guy and just starts cutting into him.  What the hell?  Who wakes up in the morning going, I wonder if today's going to be the day a guy attacks me with two sawz and just starts hacking him apart like it's seen out of Grand Theft Auto.  And the guy's only like five foot tall, trying to mind his own business.  And now he's all twitchy and looks like Jimmy. 
[01:16:30]  He's just twitching.  Where did he get cut?  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  The guy just started slicing into him all over.  He was in serious condition in the hospital for a while.  Why did that do specifically, they ever say?  No reason.  That's the beauty of New York.  You could be walking down the street, like just kind of looking through the windows, window shopping.  It could even be Fifth Avenue.  We're doing a tune.  It's a beautiful day today.  Homeless guy just takes a cobblestone from like the 1800s that he found downtown and whacks you over the head with it. 
[01:17:00]  And the next thing you know, we're in a heat wave here in New York.  You hear, and your eyes open in the hospital and you go, why is there snowing out?  It was just hot.  I don't remember where you were going with that bed.  It was just warm.  All of a sudden, after you get hit by the cobblestone.  It was warm.  Why is my family around?  It's usually when somebody asks you for directions at four in the morning.  Excuse me, which way is north?  And you've turned to point and a big fist hits you in the face.  And then your family is above you as the light slowly comes back and you go, why are there Christmas cards hanging up? 
[01:17:30]  It was just a heat wave.  We got it.  Why is tinsel?  It sounds something like this.  Yeah, which way is north?  Oh, well, let me see.  It's...  Hey, wait a minute.  I recall a heat wave.  Right.  Is this that wacky station that does Christmas in July?  I saw on YouTube two nights ago, there was a short where, I guess it is sad to watch, but it's so insane. 
[01:18:00]  A girl working register at a convenience store.  Yeah.  And there's a dude comes up and buys something.  She opens the register.  This dude clocks her so hard.  Like, just throws himself across the counter.  Like, do you ever see, what is that movie?  My Cousin Vinny?  Yeah.  The dude's like, I'm ready.  And he, like, comes into the frame and, like, punches him but goes to the side and almost lands.  Like, jumps in the air to punch a dude. 
[01:18:30]  It was, like, one of those hits.  And it was one fluid motion.  He punches her.  She goes down.  He picks up the drawer from the register at the same time.  And goes running out.  Blindsided her.  But they put, of course, on YouTube, they put it to the tune of Eye of the Tiger.  They got to add a little humor into the tragedy.  Hey, with that, we got to introduce, of course, Kevin Smith to the program from Clerks 2.  By the way, I was handed a note in honor of Jim Norton's birthday as well.  We got OzFest tickets we're going to give away during the walkover as well. 
[01:19:00]  So you got T-shirts and tickets to see OzFest.  And Kevin Smith.  So even if you should come to see him, make me feel better because I'll take credit.  I bought your DVD two weeks ago.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, was it, like, an HBO one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why'd you buy it?  I would have just given you one.  I'm a DVD guy.  I like to go out and buy.  I don't like free stuff.  I feel bad getting free stuff.  Okay.  In other words, he doesn't like giving away free stuff.  That's all right.  What I'm saying is buy my stuff.  Buy my stuff.  I buy your stuff.  Why is the Subway hacked up guy next to Della Reese?  Is that Della Reese?  Doesn't it look like her? 
[01:19:30]  What does she have to do with it?  Is that his wife?  Oh, now we know why he got slashed.  Is that his wife?  He's being touched by an angel.  Or maybe he's touched by an angel.  He's still got a...  Oh, and that's the guy.  Yeah, that's the guy that cut him up.  So if you see that guy...  Wearing the same hat that Anthony wears every day.  He's wearing the exact same hat I'm wearing.  All right.  We should get into the whole controversy with Joel Siegel.  I love...  Clerks 2 starts Friday, right?  Yes.  Why?  Why would this dude be this guy?  Why make it about himself instead just quietly leaving? 
[01:20:00]  I got no objections to the dude being offended by the movie.  I get it.  Like, you've seen the movie.  You know, it's like...  I love the movie.  I've been talking about the movie for about a week or two weeks now.  Obviously, not everyone's cup of tea.  No, absolutely not.  I mean, and the donkey show is really the least of the offensive things going on in the movie.  But if you want to leave the theater, leave.  Don't, like, turn it into a massive scene.  Like, that's so disruptive.  But this is good for you in the end.  You know that.  I mean, I guess.  I guess, like, the idea of...  Do you really want Joel Siegel liking one of your films? 
[01:20:30]  That's the thing.  Okay, good.  It's like, at the end of the day, it was never good.  But, again, I got no problem with him not liking it.  It's just the way he leaves.  Like, other critics were sitting there watching the movie.  Yeah, we should explain it a little further.  It made page six of the New York Post today.  Critic flees.  Smut screening.  Smut screening.  Who knows?  Jesus Christ.  It was interspecies erotica.  Get it right.  Don't joke about women, donkeys, and bestiality if you expect Joel Siegel to watch your movie. 
[01:21:00]  That's what director Kevin Smith found out when the pun-loving Good Morning America film  critic stormed out of a press screening of Smith's Clerks 2, which opens Friday, an act  that sparked a vicious war of words between the two.  He didn't just leave on his own.  He made a big to-do about it.  He got up and he said, well, that's it.  And, I mean, I can't say...  Honestly, I can't even say what he said on the air because the man swore.  Because he potty-mouthed.  He potty-mouthed.  What was his quote?  He used that F word.  He said, uh...  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  Time to go, roared Siegel to his fellow critics. 
[01:21:30]  First movie I've walked out of in 30 effing years.  30 effing years.  That's Joel Siegel.  That's Good Morning America's guy.  That's your guy, America.  You know something?  You could think back 30 years of movies, and I could think of a few that are probably  walk-outable.  How about Scarface?  Walk-out worthy.  The violence in that didn't offend this vomit bag, but a little bit of language.  We're so obsessed.  A little bit of naughty language, and a comedy offends him.  Different standard for comedy once again.  Totally.  And the weird thing, too, is the thing you've seen in the flick. 
[01:22:00]  Like, the setup that he walked out of, because it's when Randall is ordering the donkey show  without spoiling what happens in...  So it's not even the actual later...  No.  Oh, wow.  It's 40 minutes when Randall's, like, deciding to order up the donkey show.  He didn't even like the setup.  He didn't like the setup.  He was offended by the things that they were saying.  Oh, that's really bad.  A girl and a donkey, but having seen the flick, without giving anything away, that's...  You know, like, later on, it's a whole different scenario.  Yeah, we're going to have to talk about this the next time you come in, because I have so 
[01:22:30]  many questions.  I was sitting there in the movie going, how the hell did he get away with getting this  on film?  I know.  I don't know.  And that's all I'm going to say.  I don't know how...  Because I don't want to spoil it for Kevin and everyone that's going to see Clerks 2 this  Friday, but I'm sitting there going, how did he get this past the censors and Hollywood  and this and that?  Because what did the movie get?  We got an R.  An R.  First time.  Like, when I was...  Wait till you see.  I was worried that...  What he got away with?  We would have to, like, go through the appeals process and try to get the NC-17 turned into 
[01:23:00]  an R without making any cuts, because that's the key.  You can always go from NC-17 to an R, but you've got to be willing to take stuff out  of the movie.  So I was getting ready to kind of go, because you do it in a courtroom setting, kind of, where  like, the MPA says their piece, you say your piece, to an appeal screening jury, and then  they make the decision whether to uphold the MPA's rating or to overturn it.  Yeah.  So I was getting ready for the jihad of all jihads.  You know, like, I had all...  Because you need to have some factual information.  You have to state your opinion as to why, make your case in a big, bad way. 
[01:23:30]  I was going to, like, do an inherit-the-win style.  Just get up there and really, like, beat the desk and try to prove my point.  They just gave us an R.  First time.  First time.  I'm like, they gave us an R on Jersey Girl, and I had to go in and fight it to get it  to a PG-13.  They gave us an NC-17 on Clerks.  I had to go in to fight it to get it to an R.  On language and Clerks.  On language and Clerks.  It's just content.  Can you believe that?  It's nuts.  But this time around, I can't complain.  They gave us an R, and I was just, like, so delighted at first, because that meant I  didn't have to fight anymore. 
[01:24:00]  But then after the dust settled, I was like, what are they, retarded?  Clearly this movie's an NC-17.  They should have had an NC-17 rating.  All right, I got to continue with Joel Siegel from the New York Post today.  So, I mean, we can read this part.  It's not giving away too much of the movie.  In the scene that sent Siegel to the exit, the characters graphically discussed hiring  a woman to perform sexual favors on a donkey.  Siegel told Page Six, it was so foul and mean and repulsive, I finally realized I could not  say anything positive.  I wasn't ready for this kind of smut. 
[01:24:30]  I hope he doesn't make any more movies.  Well, Kevin, it's a badge of honor, sir.  Will you be making any more movies, or will you be making him happy?  The next one I'm going to dedicate to Joel Siegel.  Damn you.  You smut peddler.  I totally smut peddler.  The nerve of you to use adult language in an adult film.  What a douche.  You're right, though.  Think about 30 years that dude would go in movies.  30 years.  That he didn't walk out.  Didn't walk out on.  First time.  The Exorcist.  You could think of ones that are so much worse. 
[01:25:00]  Schindler's List.  Recent.  Schindler's List is a tough sit.  Yeah, that's hard to sit through.  That is a tough sit.  It's amazing what people have that.  Again, it's a double standard when you're being funny.  They have this content thing in their head with the asterisk that drama does not get,  and it's revolting.  If it's a movie about domestic violence, and you're punching your wife in the face,  if the message goes along with their ideology, they're totally fine with it.  The unjustified demeans, but when it's just comedy, they don't see that as being acceptable.  It's amazing.  The Accused, the Jodie Foster movie. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we were putting it up.  Absolutely.  A great comedy.  I do sat through that.  Once Were Warriors.  Once Were Warriors.  That was a New Zealand film, but it was a great film.  Yeah.  Thanks for the example, Rich.  Jesus.  You know, don't try to turn on me now.  I was doing well.  Hope is right, because you name a movie from a 12-hour flight from here.  We're trying to name movies.  We're trying to name movies that maybe most people might have seen, Rich.  Oh, okay.  We're trying to bring a lot of people into the discussion, not like, you know, four of  your perverted friends somewhere. 
[01:26:00]  Bring up another movie.  Break them around.  From a place where it's winter.  Hey, someone continue reading this, because it gets even better.  Because then Kevin Smith attacks back there.  Well, his blog that you...  Yeah, go to his MySpace blog.  The MySpace blog is so funny.  The real Kevin Smith.  Because you chew this guy apart and ruin any credibility he might have even had.  I don't know.  I haven't seen this guy.  I didn't even know he was still alive and doing this. 
[01:26:30]  But he gives him some good abuse in the page six.  Well, the whole thing is the puns.  It sets up the type of guy this guy is.  Yeah.  Just by giving out some of his puns.  Yeah.  Because he's punny.  That's what he is.  He's the punny guy.  For Pirates 2, he made us all titter with yo-ho-ho and a bottle of fun.  Oh, this is the dude.  For Pixar's latest, he made us squeal with delight when he wrote, 
[01:27:00]  wheelie good time for cars.  Squeal with delight really is well-written.  Kevin Smith is here.  We're talking like you're not even here.  We would do this if you weren't here, by the way.  I mean, Fozzie effing bear laughs at this guy.  The X-Men one is great, too.  Can you believe he somehow not only made us laugh, but also think when he challenged our  perception with X-Men, fails to X-cite. 
[01:27:30]  Challenged our perception.  I mean, he just made it too easy, sir.  What a tool.  Too easy.  And that was like, what?  Like 20 seconds of a Google hit?  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Watcher Joel Siegel and that's what comes up.  And this is the garbage that comes up.  And he can't sit there like a mature adult.  Which he's paid to do.  And watch.  You're right.  It's his job.  He walked out on his job.  Yeah.  Right.  He's supposed to sit there no matter if he's offended, doesn't like the movie, is bored  by it.  He is supposed to sit there and finish his job. 
[01:28:00]  This is a dude who works for ABC, for Disney, like as a critic.  And he's been doing it for 27 years on either ABC or Good Morning America.  And the dude walked out of his job.  Now, I have no problem with the dude being offended by the movie, not liking the movie.  If the dude wants to leave, fine.  But you don't make a public spectacle of yourself.  You don't draw all the attention away.  Made it about him.  He was attention seeking.  Wanted people to agree.  Wanted to set a trend or a precedent where now people are going to follow him out like 
[01:28:30]  the Piper.  That's it.  We're leaving, kid.  You hear what Joel did?  He took a stand.  If Joel is leaving, I'm out of here.  And a critic screening, no less.  So you got like, you know, 30, 50 other people in the room.  Yeah.  Like, what if there's somebody in there who's kind of like, hey, Joel's right.  And like, he gets up and goes.  Yeah.  Or, you know, it just takes you out in the movie.  It's like somebody coming at you with a saw on the subway.  Breaks your train.  Right. 
[01:29:00]  I bet you thought.  You forget about your commute.  Totally.  I bet you thought everyone was going to follow him out.  And it turns out it was just him on the sidewalk.  Everyone else was still inside.  Just the douche with his popcorn alone and a bad mustache.  And the sick thing, too, is he wasn't even supposed to be at that screening at night.  Like, the publicist over at Weinstein Company, I was like, I didn't see this dude on the screening  list.  Because if I'd seen this dude on the screening list, I would have been like, why are you  letting this guy go?  Yeah.  I get into it with them over at Weinstein sometimes because they're like, you have to let every  critic go.  And I'm like, why would I let somebody see the movie for free when historically they have 
[01:29:30]  trashed me?  Yeah.  And like, this dude, last movie out, like, wrote one of the most horrible reviews about  Jersey Girl.  But regardless, whatever.  The dude wasn't supposed to be there.  He was supposed to be at the next day's screening.  And he called them up and he was like, I want to get into tonight's.  And like, 10 minutes before the movie started.  So they held the movie for him for a couple of minutes, waited until he got here.  And then 40 minutes into it, he disrupts and turns it and turns it.  What a...  See?  And that's why you don't want him there.  People give you grief a lot of times on message boards and stuff about your, you know, stance  on message boards and the fact that if a critic like him wants to come into a free screening 
[01:30:00]  and you see it on a list and say, no, you know, have him go to this other one.  They're like, oh, look, Kevin's protecting himself for doing this.  Why?  What's the problem?  I've never agreed more with a stance than I agree with that one.  It's ridiculous to allow people that you know are just going to come into trash.  Totally.  To see it for free.  It's like, dude, I don't care.  Like, write any bad thing you want about the movie.  But pay to see it.  Pay to see it now.  Jackass.  It's like, whatever.  He's a Good Morning America guy. 
[01:30:30]  And I'm sitting there going, nobody from Good Morning America watches this thing.  Watches this go and gets their mind changed.  The last paragraph in the Post article is great, man.  Kevin, I don't come, basically more Kevin Smith.  I don't come down to your job and slap the taste out of your mouth for coming up with a line like,  Shark Tale is a halibut good time.  Halibut good time.  And then Kevin Smith continues.  So don't F with my stuff while it's still screening.  And then continues. 
[01:31:00]  What are you, a 12-year-old boy cutting loose with your pals at a Friday night screening of Scary Movie 4  while your parents are in a theater down the hall watching The Devil Wears Friday?  Leave the diva-like behavior and drama queen antics to the movie stars, not the movie reviewer,  you rude-ass bleep.  How great is that?  Exactly what they were.  They were antics.  The antics of a douche.  Kevin, you need help with this?  In terms of you come to the right guys.  You need help with this?  Go get them. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, I'll talk to you.  You want our pest to take care of Joel Segal?  The pests are ruthless.  Just give the words.  What do they do?  Actually, to have a big director and a celebrity tell the pest to attack would be...  What do they do?  They would be so flattered.  They're just irritating.  They just bother.  Yeah, they will not leave him alone.  Maybe we should explain what the one pest will do for Kevin Smith.  And then, if Kevin likes this, then he could give the attack orders.  How's that?  They don't hurt anybody.  It's nothing bad.  They will pretty much just find his email, in this case, and just make their opinions known.  In any way, they can get in touch with him and let them know that they're not happy with the way you were treated. 
[01:32:00]  The man works for ABC.  If you want to find a list of other Segal puns, Dupree delivers an unwelcome guest.  Of course.  Depp captains a seaworthy pirate ship.  Seaworthy.  S-E-E-worthy.  No engine trouble in cars.  Is Da Vinci Crote worth cracking?  Williams RV, a slow ride.  Slow ride.  V for Vendetta.  And vacuous.  A complete, quote, failure to launch. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  What a jackass.  Hey, uh...  You must just sit there going, I gotta come up with a pun.  I'm known for the puns.  So, like, it's easy to find a dude's email address.  Like, look, I'm not telling anybody to do anything, but...  So you want us to tell the pest?  I'm not saying anybody should do anything.  But it's just, like, that's his job.  Keep it legal.  Like, shouldn't the man be responsible to do his job?  And if you're not going to do your job, don't disrupt other people when they're doing their jobs.  Or maybe, God forbid, enjoying the flick. 
[01:33:00]  It's time to enjoy the power of the ONA pest.  The virus.  Mr. Smith.  Yeah.  We say attack.  Keep it legal.  Of course you do.  Keep it legal.  Hey, the phone's honestly just going crazy.  Somebody wants to defend Joel Siegel.  Make sure Michael stays on the line.  He wants to know if you heard what Rex Reed did at Miami Vice, I guess?  No.  Oh, I thought it was about your movie.  I didn't read it.  Have sex with a man?  All right.  What did he do?  He got caught between two seats or something?  What?  All right.  We'll get into that next. 
[01:33:30]  There's a story there.  And Rich Voss.  Rich, are you promoting anything today?  No.  No.  I got a guest.  I brought somebody with.  Really?  All right.  Can we say hi next?  Yeah.  Because we've got to take a quick break.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony Wow Line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05. 
[01:34:00]  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

[01:34:30]  Hope you're having fun with Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  Kevin Smith in studio.  Clerks 2 opening up in theaters on Friday.  Jimmy, what are you going to do for your birthday?  I'm actually doing this four-day acting workshop, which I took the day off from today.  I'm just going to kind of hang out with a friend of mine.  I never take days off.  So no shows tonight.  Just relax.  How goes the show?  How goes Lucky Louie?  I love it.  Critics smash it.  They hate it.  But the viewers are going up every week. 
[01:35:00]  Good news, though.  Joel Siegel loves it.  Oh, that's Joel Siegel.  That guy, yeah.  He says, I got lucky with Louie.  Did you?  Hey, we got more puns coming in from Joel Siegel?  Yeah, we got a few.  I'm not sure if some of these are from Joel Siegel, though.  All right.  But these are.  Bewitched offers tricks and treats.  He enjoyed Bewitched.  He liked Bewitched.  He liked Bewitched.  I thought because the tricks were because it was magic, and the treats were the laughs  that ensued.  Hitch up with Smith's comic Valentine, the movie Hitch. 
[01:35:30]  So he obviously liked Hitch.  I'm sure that was a gem.  Jamie Foxx delivers Ray of Sunshine.  Get it?  He liked that movie a lot, I hear.  Spielberg's War Out of This World.  New superheroes are Fantastic Boar.  Fantastic Four, right?  Good.  Depp gets Golden Ticket as Willy Wonka, and Aniston's side-tracked and derailed.  And then, I'm not sure if this is true. 
[01:36:00]  Passion of the Christ nails it.  Beautiful.  Is that one?  Schindler's List.  A movie I would not not see.  But some people thought it was a gag, though.  Hey, we're trying to get Joel Siegel on the line.  And to be fair, you know, who knows if, when you write for the newspapers, you don't always  write your own headlines. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  But I've been watching that dude review movies since I was a kid.  Like, before there was cable and there was just the basic channel over here.  He was always on Eyewitness News.  He was an ABC dude.  I remember that.  He's been making puns for years.  I've got to imagine that that's him.  And if not, it's him.  It's him.  It's got to be.  Joel.  Hi there.  It's Joel Siegel, everyone.  Hey, I don't understand what's going on.  What do you mean you don't understand what's going on?  I don't understand who Kevin Smith is quoting.  I never said, I don't do those puns.  I never said, what does he have me saying about shark tails and the halibut or wheelies 
[01:37:00]  on cars?  Never said that.  You didn't do the wheelies one?  No, I didn't.  It's all on the page, sir.  It's on your Joel Siegel page at ABC.  There you go.  He could be wrong, too.  Also, I did my very best to make a point to page six to say that Kevin Smith is a very  good filmmaker and I like his films.  Yeah, but I think the problem here is that you did not act as a professional during this 
[01:37:30]  screening.  Oh, absolutely.  I think, in fact, maybe movies would be better if more people did what I did.  Did you ever walk out on a violent film?  Why just a comedy with language content and not a violent film?  It wasn't a comedy with language content.  The descriptions of the act were so vivid and so repulsive, I just realized there's no  way in the world I could say anything positive about this movie.  There's no reason I want to listen to any of them. 
[01:38:00]  And I stood up and I got a little bit carried away.  We understand that.  Okay.  A little carried away is very distracting.  Oh, come on.  No, no, no.  I'm saying you sat in.  Come on, you go to the movies and you see things all the time.  And it's horrible.  But you're a paid professional, sir.  You're a paid professional.  It's your job to sit there and watch the movie and review it.  That's what you get paid for.  So it's one thing to walk out.  And if you don't want to do your job, fine.  I understand the movie.  It's not your cup of tea.  Here's a question.  Just off the top of my head.  Yes.  Why isn't walking out of a movie, you know, that's like the ultimate criticism, you know? 
[01:38:30]  That's fine.  But walking out of the movie, Joel, is one thing.  Walking out of the movie is one thing.  But being disruptive for everyone else whose job it is to sit there and review the movie?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Oh, dude, don't Bill O'Reilly me with like a nah, nah, nah.  Answer the question.  Why would you be that kind of person that would be disruptive in a movie?  If you were sitting there enjoying Ray, if you were sitting there enjoying Ray as you did enjoy Ray and somebody got up and started shucking and jiving and talking about how horrible it was, you would write about that the next day. 
[01:39:00]  How could that dude be so disruptive?  How long do you think it took me to say, I've had it, this is the first movie I've ever walked out on in 30 years?  Sir, I could care less if you walk out of the movie.  It's a badge of honor that you don't like it in some ways.  But being disruptive, that's my point.  Why would you be that jackass?  Why would you be the guy that yells and interrupts the movie for other people?  There are other critics in that screening that are so unprofessional, man. 
[01:39:30]  That is so, that's like newbie, man.  That's newbie, first year hack critic behavior.  You're really stretching it.  What?  Are you out of your mind?  I mean, granted, you've been doing this job for 27 years, but like, have you lost focus about what you're supposed to do?  You're supposed to sit there, watch the movie, and then write a review afterwards.  If you want to leave, that's fine, but you don't disrupt it for everybody else.  Have you walked out on a movie?  No, I've never walked out on a movie.  How about that?  But if I have walked out on a movie, if I have walked out on a movie, I haven't been like, hey, everybody, I'm walking out on the movie. 
[01:40:00]  Look at me and my mustache.  I'm leaving, everybody.  That's not the way to do it.  You just quietly leave.  You don't call a bunch of attention to yourself.  The movie's on the screen.  That's where the show's up front, not in the seats in the aisle.  It is bizarre, because you're a critic.  You have no idea if the rest of the movie was good or not.  The movie could have got a lot better.  And how long was that scene that he walked out on?  Maybe two minutes?  That scene he walked out on was like three minutes.  And also, Joel, it's like, it's set up for something that happens later.  You didn't even bother to wait to find out.  That's what kills me.  It's your job to sit there and watch a movie. 
[01:40:30]  Like, you get paid to watch movies for free.  And all you have to do is write about it.  And it's one thing for you to leave.  It's like, if you don't want to do your job, you can't be a professional about it.  I can't tell you what to do.  I can't tell you how to be a man, for God's sakes.  But if you want to be the guy that, like, gets up and leaves, just do it quietly.  You don't have to do it, like, in such a persnickety fashion.  All right, let's hear what Joel has to say.  Can you please stop for a second?  You stop.  Let's go, Joel.  I really object to you calling what I did nonprofessional. 
[01:41:00]  I object to what you did, you jackass.  That was unprofessional.  It wasn't as if it was two minutes into the movie.  It was almost an hour into the movie.  And I realized no matter what happened in the rest of the movie,  God forbid the stuff that they were explaining came to life on the screen.  But Kevin's not talking about that being a problem if you didn't like the movie.  I can care less if you don't like the movie.  Wait a second.  Yeah.  Let me finish.  Okay.  If you'd like an apology, I'm glad to apologize. 
[01:41:30]  This was indeed the first movie I've walked out on in 30 years.  And if there is a second movie that I walk out on, I'll be much quieter.  That's it?  Oh, geez.  Is that fair?  I would like, I really want Kevin Smith to know that I made a point of telling Page Six  that I thought he was a very good filmmaker, that Clerks 1 was one of the most important  films of our time, that because of Clerks 1, the independent, in great part because of Clerks 1. 
[01:42:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  No, this is not blah, blah.  Basically, to be fair, the New York Post guy did tell me he said those things, which  is fine, but it's all after, I appreciate that, Joel, but it's all after the fact.  What I don't appreciate is you going out like such a sucker, man.  Like, you've got to, like, yell and scream and call attention.  I'm thinking about yourself instead of, uh...  Wait a second, guys.  Yes.  How long do you think, just in time, it took me to stand up and say...  40 minutes.  This is the first movie I've left, it walked out... 
[01:42:30]  It doesn't matter, sir.  It doesn't matter if it took you...  How long do you think it took?  It's 40 minutes into the movie.  I know exactly where you left.  They told me exactly where you left, but it doesn't matter.  No, no, no.  How long do you think it took that little tirade?  How long was his disruption, he's saying?  Oh, how long is the disruption?  I don't care if it's five seconds.  It doesn't matter.  It could be a second.  If you're yelling out loud and competing with the dialogue, that is so disrespectful.  No, I wasn't competing with the dialogue.  Sir, if you're yelling out loud, you are competing with the dialogue.  A single cell phone ring is distracting.  And that's a second.  There's a reason they put those ads up in front of the movie with, like,  turn off your cell phones, please no talking, be courteous to other movie viewers. 
[01:43:00]  And you did it in a room full of critics, man.  Someone turn off Joel Siegel, please.  We want to watch the movie.  How unprofessional is that?  If that was Spike Lee, would you have got up and walked out?  I agree.  I think it's not unprofessional, and I think if more critics walked out on more movies,  they sound repulsive and disgusting.  But then don't go in the first place.  And again, I have no problem with you walking out.  I wasn't expecting what I saw.  That's fine.  I have no problem with you walking out, dude.  I don't care if you don't like the movie.  Like, I get it.  It's not everybody's cup of tea, man. 
[01:43:30]  But you don't be disruptive when you walk out.  That's where you were wrong.  Hey, did I apologize?  Did I say if I ever did it again, I would do it differently?  It's too late, man.  Lightning's out of the bottle, sir.  You were disruptive in the screening.  You know, it led you back on the air.  Come on.  What?  I don't think Joel understands.  You're talking to Kevin Smith right now.  Where's Kevin Smith?  You've been speaking with Kevin.  You've been talking to him.  The entire time, Joel. 
[01:44:00]  You've been talking to Kevin Smith the whole time.  Kevin, I'm sorry.  I've stood aside.  I think you're a terrific filmmaker.  Time to retire, Joel.  This is not for me.  Do you know you walked out?  One-way trip to Florida.  Joel.  Joel.  Let me remind you.  You walked out of a movie.  Do you remember this?  I feel like I just wasted all that breath.  You wasted all that breath.  That was...  Joel must have been like, wow, Opie and Anthony really want to back Kevin Smith on this one. 
[01:44:30]  With a jury, I rest my case.  Did you ever get lost while blueberry picking with Catherine Hepburn?  It's a movie reference.  He didn't get it.  Are you still there, Joel?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you've been talking to Kevin.  What you guys are doing.  All those points that...  I behave like a civilized human being and I don't know what's going on.  Well, if...  A civilized human being doesn't get up and yell things out loud when he leaves the movie.  That's Kevin Smith.  Says Kevin Smith.  No, don't say, oh, come on.  Dude, again, for the record, and I will stress this as much as possible, you walking out, I have 
[01:45:00]  no issue with, I get it, not everyone's going to like the movie, but you being a disruption  when you're walking out, that is incredibly unprofessional, and I agree with you, sir,  more critics should leave movies that they don't like, and then that would prohibit them  from reviewing them, because you can't review a movie unless you watch it from beginning  to end, but being a disruption when you walk out, that's...  You're acting like an insolent child, dude.  That is such childish behavior, and then you yell, you use the F word, dude.  How come you can use the F word in real life, but you can't use it on that job of yours 
[01:45:30]  at Good Morning America?  They'd kick you off the air for using the F word.  Are you talking to me about childish behavior?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, sir, because, yes.  My childish behavior is on display in a movie, and everybody knows what that movie's rated  going into it, they know what they're getting in terms of, like, there's an R rating at  the bottom, and it says what the content is.  Your childish behavior, nobody expects that from a critic to, like, screen things inside  a movie theater.  Wait a second.  What's his exact quote?  You got it in front of you? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  I threw it away.  Dude, I heard...  You know who first told me about this?  I was at MTV yesterday, and I was interviewing with a kid for the MTV Radio News Network, and  he's the one that...  He's like, there was some old critic in the movie, he goes, I think it was Roger Ebert,  who got up and, like, made a big scene.  He's gone, I'd never seen anything like it.  He's like, except maybe when I was in high school.  We have the quote here.  The quote.  Time to go, roared Siegel to his fellow critics.  First movie I've walked out of in 30 bleepin' years.  Like, why was that necessary? 
[01:46:30]  Like, why couldn't you have just quietly left the theater?  First of all, I told you guys at least four minutes ago that you're right.  I could have just walked out of the theater.  I was incensed.  I was angry at what I had seen on the screen.  Okay, then you write a review about it.  That's your forum.  And what's your problem with bestiality, by the way?  Like, it all depends.  You don't find that unprofessional, though.  You apologize for it, but you're...  I apologize for what?  For being loud and disruptive when you left instead of just quietly leaving. 
[01:47:00]  I don't think I was loud and disruptive, but that's...  But it came from more than one source, sir.  There were other people in that screening room.  I said what I said.  It is disruptive.  And you were disruptive, though.  Now, you don't find that unprofessional as a critic?  That's a tough question to answer.  It certainly is.  Of course it is, because it's unprofessional.  Thank you, Morning America, like fire to you.  You admit that it's unprofessional, and a critic, a professional critic that's been in the business as long as you have, 
[01:47:30]  should know better than to disrupt a film that other critics are screening when you leave.  If you leave, if you hate the movie.  No one's arguing the point.  If you don't like it, you don't like it.  Fine.  It's the fact that you are being very unprofessional.  We want you to resign, Joel.  You do, huh?  After my job, you're going to mustache?  We want your resignation, and we want you to shave that awful mustache.  Because you're basically saying that Clerks 2 doesn't sell. 
[01:48:00]  Doesn't what?  Doesn't sell.  Oh, I see.  And I'm the one who's supposed to make those puns.  They're punny.  Where did all of those puns come from?  If you object to those puns, you've got to go to the Joel Siegel website, like that, ABC, your own page.  That's where they all came from.  Did you really like Bewitched?  Did you say Bewitched offers tricks and treats?  I have no idea.  Did you write Hitch Up with Smith's Comic Valentine?  Did I write what?  Hitch Up with Smith's Comic Valentine? 
[01:48:30]  You know, the movie Hitch.  No, I didn't, no.  Did you write Jamie Foxx delivers Ray of Sunshine?  No.  Joel, do you write any of your reviews?  Joel, do you write any of these headlines?  I don't know where they're coming from.  Do you know what day it is, Joel?  Yes, I do know what day it is.  All right, very good.  Do you know what I have?  I'm not going to go into my personal life.  You can.  It's an open forum.  Oh, that's okay.  Joel, to be fair, I mean, if where Joel's going, Joel survived cancer, which I applaud him for.  He went through a bad cancer bout and whatnot. 
[01:49:00]  Joel, I don't wish you ill will.  Like, I don't want...  You can wish me all the ill will you like.  I don't.  I don't wish you ill will at all.  I do not know where those puns came from.  What?  Dude, honestly.  Okay, but, all right, well, that's, they're on your website, they're attached to...  I don't have a website.  I think they...  They're on the Joel Siegel page at ABC.  If you click on ABC...  If that's where they came from, I did not write them.  They were rewritten.  I do not say those things on the air.  Sir, not for nothing, but I grew up here in New Jersey, New York, New Jersey area. 
[01:49:30]  I've been watching ABC even before it was owned by Disney.  Back when it was just Channel 7, you would review movies on Eyewitness News.  You have always been a punny guy.  Don't disavow it now.  So, you like to review movies with a bit of wit, sir, right?  I do, with a joke, yeah, but I did not, I am not responsible for any of the puns Kevin  Smith quoted.  Did you write, Passion of the Christ nails it?  Yeah, sure.  Absolutely.  In fact, I gave Passion of the Christ a positive review. 
[01:50:00]  That's a movie you could easily have walked out on by the way.  Yeah, that's like...  No, I thought he did a very good job making the movie.  You knew what you were getting for the rest of the film after 10 minutes.  Why is it, it's okay to watch people beat up Jesus Christ, but it's not okay to listen  to dudes talk about...  A donkey show.  Yeah.  Like, it's just language.  It's just conversation.  But I get it, dude.  Like, I don't object to you not liking the movie.  No, it's not a question of what they were talking about, and I'm certainly a firm believer  in freedom of speech and the First Amendment.  You must be, because you get up in movie theaters and yell things out loud. 
[01:50:30]  And that's the one thing free speech doesn't cover.  Why not?  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  Fire.  I didn't say fire.  Of course.  Of course you did, Joel.  Perhaps more than that, Joel.  We understand.  You didn't yell fire.  Honestly, like, there have been movies where I have paid to sit there and watch a movie.  Yeah.  Where I've had to shell out of my hard-earned bucks that I haven't liked and I've never  gotten up in the theater.  I've never walked out.  And yelled things out loud.  Yelled out loud as you're leaving.  Yeah, that's...  It just, Joel, came off as a little unprofessional.  It's like, until you got to see it free for nothing. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, you got to have a little more respect for the filmmaker.  I'll promise Opie and Anthony I will never do it again, but I just couldn't.  I was so offended.  I say you sent Kevin Smith nine bucks.  Joel, did you see Bachelor Party years ago?  Yeah, and I remember that stuff, too.  And did you like it?  No, I didn't.  And I didn't...  Did you walk out on it?  No, I didn't walk out on it, but I was kind of shocked.  Because it's got Tom Hanks in it.  Yeah.  Tom Hanks and a mule.  If I'd had Tom Hanks in Clerks, too...  Oh, forget about it.  There you go.  All right.  What are you going to do next, badmouth Lucky Louie? 
[01:51:30]  I'm sorry?  I said, what are you going to do next, badmouth Lucky Louie on HBO?  You know, one of the unfortunate things about the job I do is I don't get to watch much television  because I'm always going to the movies.  Yeah, what's the next movie you're going to go see?  I have to go to Miami Vice on Monday.  I'm going to go see a movie from Little Miss Sunshine at noon.  And I'm not expecting to be...  I was really angry and affronted by what I had heard on the screen. 
[01:52:00]  And it wasn't just that part.  It was all of the stuff leading up to it.  I was not expecting it at all.  You know, we got an eight-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, right?  Eight minutes.  Eight minutes.  There you go.  Good.  I think it's kind of retired, Joel.  And also, a lot of people have said the movie is very sweet and heartfelt, too.  Kevin, it just took everybody that long to walk out because it was the entire crowd.  You thought it was a standing ovation. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, Joel.  They were just following Joel.  What I thought was the clapping of hands was really just people going, I'm effing out of here.  Hey, Joel, you didn't hear my question before.  If this was a Spielberg movie or Spike Lee, would you have walked out on it?  With the same content?  With the same thing?  I apologize for Rich Vasa, Joel Segal.  Yeah.  If it was the same movie, yes, I would have walked out on it.  And you would have made a big stink at us.  I'm honest about Kevin Smith.  I think he's a good filmmaker.  Oh, yeah.  He did say that.  He's not good either.  I'm sure that's going to make his day. 
[01:53:00]  We got a slogan here.  Rich, not a wealth of humor.  Again, Joel, I have no objection to you not liking the movie.  I get it.  Not everything I do is going to be everyone's cup of tea.  Okay.  And I promise, next time I walk out on a movie, I'll do it as quietly as possible.  Joel, let me tell you something, too.  I applaud you today for allowing us to confront you.  That's right.  Because most times we'll read something in the paper.  We try to get them on the phone.  And they don't answer their phone. 
[01:53:30]  They're on vacation.  They're taking the day off.  They're playing golf.  No one shows up and defends themselves.  I applaud you for coming on our show today.  I really am proud of what I did.  And he fessed up.  Well, if you're proud of what you did with leaving.  But you apologized.  But I would like to reach.  How can you apologize if you're proud of what you did?  Hmm?  But you apologized twice already.  No, I said I wouldn't do it again.  No, but you did.  Am I crazy?  No, he apologized.  You literally said I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I perhaps should not have.  Although, for the five or ten seconds, I don't get it. 
[01:54:00]  It wasn't as disastrous as you guys are making it out to be.  Oh, you're out of your mind.  Let's say you were sitting there doing your review on Good Morning America.  And for five or ten seconds, I jumped in front of the camera and was just like,  This guy's a jackass.  Bloody, bloody blue.  Like, that would be totally unprofessional.  Pun, pun, pun.  Gay porn mustache.  Pun, pun, pun.  You know, I think what I would have done, what I would do,  would do the same thing you guys do when that happens to you when you're on the air live,  is you play off of it.  You know, you go hard for films to play off of it. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I was in the movie theater to play off of it,  and the movie can't play off of it either because, as you know, it's just flickering images.  Film isn't very spontaneous.  We're talking about five seconds.  I think everybody understood.  But five seconds is all relative, is what I'm saying.  If I went to your job and did five seconds.  Five seconds is all it takes for a suicide's bomb bell to go off.  It took Kennedy out in five seconds.  Yeah, right.  How would it be in JFK if I kept yelling,  Where's his hat?  Can I get a word in?  Yeah, go ahead, Joel. 
[01:55:00]  Seriously.  Okay.  I would like Kevin Smith to know that I think he's a fine filmmaker  and that I am not responsible for any of those puns he quotes me.  Can we use that quote in a clerk's two ad in the newspaper?  Kevin Smith is a fine filmmaker.  Joel Siegel?  Yeah.  All right.  There it is.  There you go.  We wasted way too much time on Joel Siegel because look who's behind you.  Who cares?  Look who's behind you.  Thank you for getting on the phone.  That was very cool you could get on the phone, sir.  You're old news now.  We've got to move on with our radio show. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  What's going on next?  Well, we've got a star of Clerks 2 in studio.  I personally saw the movie.  I loved it.  And everyone I went with loved the movie.  There you go.  All right, Joel.  That's fine.  Thanks for hanging with us.  We really appreciate that you didn't pussy out.  Whatever that means.  Well, don't walk out on the phone call now because he's using that language.  But, yeah, thanks for taking the call.  All right.  Glad to do it.  All right.  Joel Siegel from Good Morning America.  With a mustache like that, I'm not surprised he doesn't know what pussy out. 
[01:56:00]  With that, we've got to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Jimmy Day.  You guys shut up.  A celebration in honor of James Norton.  Oh, man.  Oh, pears.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy, bring it back for your birthday.  Bring us back.  We are, um...  We are, um...  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Um...  Back soon.  He just wants to listen to the music.  I just want to listen to the Sabbath.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  Kevin Smith in the studio.  Happy birthday.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We've got to say hi to Philly because our ratings are coming out today.  We're keeping our fingers crossed.  What time?  We have, uh...  I don't know, another hour, hour and a half.  We have, uh...  OzFest tickets to give away, uh...  during the walkover today.  And we also have Jimmy Day t-shirts to give to everybody that shows for the walkover today. 
[01:57:00]  Kevin, are you doing the walkover?  Naturally, sir.  All right.  Naturally.  Uh...  A lot of excitement in the studio with the Joel Siegel thing.  Gun me down.  Huh?  Anyone looking to gun me down would know that I'm...  I'll be on the walkover.  No.  Oh, and how do I turn on Jason's mic?  Hello, hello, hello.  There he is.  Hello.  We don't even have...  Ladies and gentlemen, Jason Mews.  Jason Mews from Clerks 2, of course.  Nice.  I want to say it again because there was a lot of negativity in that last break. 
[01:57:30]  I loved Clerks 2, and I want to say it.  Just about the whole gang saw it, and we...  A lot of people...  We loved the movie.  Love it.  I was telling Kevin the choice of music for the film was fantastic.  I pay attention to that stuff, what directors use, what kind of music they use throughout  a film, and I really, really enjoyed the choices.  You like King Diamond, sir?  Hell yeah.  Who's...  Is it King Diamond?  Is it Merciful Fate or King Diamond's...  It's King Diamond.  Oh, how fantastic.  I love him.  Two King Diamond tracks.  And there's a silence... 
[01:58:00]  We got away.  Weren't that expensive.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But it should have been.  It should have been way expensive.  There's a Silence of the Lambs thing that made us laugh really hard because we're...  He does the tuck.  Yeah.  He does the tuck.  All right.  I don't know how much you want me to give away here.  We can spoil that.  What is it?  And then I hear family members are in the movie.  Do you like talking about that, too?  I'm sorry.  I was reading.  Your family members?  There's family members in the movie?  Yeah.  I got family members in the movie.  I got my wife's in the movie.  You're like...  I got my little kid's in the movie.  She's got a little parents. 
[01:58:30]  Your mother-in-law, I think, too?  My mother-in-law's in the movie.  My mom's in the movie.  I like to do the full...  I like to throw the whole family in there.  Half the cast is in there, too.  I mean, the crew.  Yeah, basically, everybody worked on the movie.  It's just cheaper than doing...  I was going to say, that keeps the cost down.  What's up, Rich?  So the movie comes out this Friday?  Yeah.  So I guess when I'm in Atlanta at the Funny Farm, I'll go see a Friday afternoon.  Sure.  I like that double plug right there.  Well, Friday night when no one's at the show and they cancel it, just go catch the movie. 
[01:59:00]  That's not a bad idea, too.  That was good.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's take some phone calls.  It's Nico in D.C.  Nico.  Hey, what's going on?  Kevin Smith.  What's going on?  O&A.  And Jason.  Jason Mewes in studio, too.  Oh, and Jason Mewes, you funny MF-er.  Yep.  Hey, I actually have seen every movie Kevin Smith has ever done, including that clown movie  that was straight to video.  Vulgar.  That is a movie my friend Brian Johnson made. 
[01:59:30]  One of the creepiest films I've ever seen.  Yeah, it's very unsettling.  I actually was going to go wait and see Clerks 2 on Saturday.  Right on.  But now knowing that Joel Siegel walked out of it and that there's donkey sex references  in it, I'm going to go see it Friday morning before I go to work.  See, there it is.  Joel Siegel.  Joel Siegel selling you tickets.  He's going to end up helping you in the end.  Let's go to Michael in Atlanta.  Michael.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering if you guys heard about the whole Rex Reed thing with him. 
[02:00:00]  I think he showed up like two minutes into Miami Vice the other night, and he got stuck  between two seats and he was crying.  He got trapped?  Oh, no.  He got literally trapped between seats.  Where's the blog?  Did you know where the blog is, sir, where it's written about?  Well, I hit the link at Jeffrey Wells' site.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you go to Hollywood Elsewhere and you've got to scroll down to like last week, it'll  link you to this dude's blog.  I forget the guy's name.  I think he writes for New York Magazine or the New Yorker.  I forget.  But he was there. 
[02:00:30]  And he's like, you know, I'm getting ready to watch the movie, and I hear some rustling  behind me.  And all of a sudden, I look back, and there's a man trapped between two of the theater seats  with his leg caught.  And he's like, and I'm looking hard, and it turns out to be Rex Reed.  And it took them almost five minutes to free him from the seats.  Maybe there should be like a mandatory retirement date.  Stupid queen shooing his own leg off the fence.  That is sad, man. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  He was crying?  Yeah, he was crying.  They said he was acting like he had a heart attack.  Oh, poor bastard.  That is great stuff.  Oh, Kevin.  Sir.  Kevin, you should tell the guys about Fred Toucher in Atlanta.  What happened?  Fred Toucher.  Yeah, I was a DJ in Atlanta.  I went on a show.  Kid who?  Do you know that guy?  No.  Kid who?  I was on that guy.  I was on the other day.  I did a...  What is his name?  Kid Chris?  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  In Philly. 
[02:01:30]  Philly.  On YSP.  We're on the same station.  Yeah, on YSP.  And I did a phoner, and he went through a list of questions where it was just like,  which is bigger, your gut or your bald spot?  Like, things like that.  I've never been on that dude's show before.  I'm like, I'm just going to roll with this, I guess.  Yeah, but Fred Toucher.  But he was just a list of insults?  Essentially.  Totally.  Why would he do that?  He was just like, when Ben was dating J-Lo, did you ever get a piece of that greasy  Mexican or something like that?  Like, those kinds of things.  Why'd he do it?  I don't know.  But I just kind of rolled with it.  Interesting.  I don't think anything to sell a ticket at this point. 
[02:02:00]  I'll do anything.  But the Fred Toucher thing, yeah, I was in Atlanta.  He was on this radio station.  What is the, do you know the name of the radio station?  It was on 99X.  99X.  And I went in there for Jersey Girl, and they were all kiss-assy and nice to me while I was  there.  Oh, no.  Let's take pictures and have donuts together and all that stuff.  And then I left Atlanta.  Two days later, I was in Boston doing press, and somebody wrote on the message board, like,  those dudes are trashing you in Atlanta.  God, we get into this all the time. 
[02:02:30]  I mean, if we don't like you, we'll trash you to your face.  That's the thing.  It's like, just do it.  These guys at these other radio shows, they'll play the game.  As soon as you leave, they hear the door close, and they know they're in a safe environment  without you around.  Then they go and trash you.  That's what I said to them.  I called them up.  We get into this all the time with our comedian friends and other people that do our show.  I called that dude up at the, I called back the Atlanta radio station.  I was like, why are you guys doing this now?  Like, why didn't you do it when I was there?  You could have totally told me to my face.  And, like, the movie would have made for interesting radio.  Yeah.  I'm like, you know how it is, Kevin. 
[02:03:00]  You know, we're just playing a game.  And I'm like, what game?  Oh, that's the excuse, too.  Ew.  What douche.  Yes.  And they paint themselves as, like, an edgy radio station and radio show and whatnot.  And the guy's like, you know, if we trash the guests, it's harder for us to get other  guests.  I'm like, but you guys paint yourselves as the alternative.  Like, so what do you care about getting guests?  Like, be the alternative then.  Be the guy that actually says to my face, like, the movie sucked.  And then we could sit there and debate it.  So he's a fraud to your face.  And then a fraud when you call on the phone, like, well, no, we were just kind of being 
[02:03:30]  fraudulent again, but this way.  What a douche.  And then he got dropped out of Atlanta, 99X, kicked him off.  And then he was jobless for a while.  And I think now he does afternoon drive in Boston or something like that.  Yeah.  I think he might be on WBCN, the same station we're on.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  I talked to some other DJ in Boston, too, when I was out there.  I forget which station that was.  And that dude's running into problems with him, too.  Like, he got to town, and this other dude has been on the radio in Boston for years and  years and years.  And this guy got into town and just started, like, his whole shtick is like, that other 
[02:04:00]  guy sucks.  I rock.  You know?  It's like, come on.  Like, say something.  You've got to back it up with some stuff.  Say something original.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  God damn.  Don't be the guy that just comes to town and you're just like, the other guy's a jerk.  By the way, that guy.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Michael.  Yeah, looking forward to the movie, Kevin.  Talk to you later.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, on Friday.  Try not to get trapped between two movie theater seats while you're there.  Yeah, I know it.  Rex Reed style.  And please, please, for the love of God, don't get up and yell things in the movie.  I promise. 
[02:04:30]  Who wrote the movie?  Was it all you or?  Clerks 2?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was me.  God, the dialogue about Lord of the Rings.  Yeah.  See, I'm trying not to give stuff away.  And that kid is a star, man.  Yeah, the kid that plays Elias.  Yeah.  He is a, what else was he in?  I looked him up because he was so good in Clerks 2.  I saw him in a movie that Jeff made called Now You Know, which I guess is coming out on  DVD later in the year.  But I just thought he was really cool.  I felt like I knew him or saw him in another film, so I looked him up.  He was in a movie called Cheats. 
[02:05:00]  He was in a movie called Cheats.  Yeah.  He is a star in the making, man.  He was great.  Yeah.  I think he'll pop off the movie in a big bad way.  Absolutely.  I think he's, uh.  He's really, really funny.  Yeah.  The movie's just the movie.  It's a funny movie.  I mean, granted, it's, again, ain't for everybody.  It's like, you know, it's got pretty outrageous humor in it, pretty offensive.  And if you don't like the idea of the donkey show, you know, it ain't for you.  But, like, we knew that.  That's why we made the movie inexpensively.  And you don't care.  Yeah, totally.  That's the beauty of it.  Totally.  You know, this is the film you want to make.  And the cameos are great.  I mean, it's, we just all really, really liked it. 
[02:05:30]  You know, there are very few people that are just kind of, oh, Kevin Smith, yeah, I guess  I kind of liked it.  And it's like, love the guy, he's God, this guy stinks, sucks, I want him dead.  Yeah, there's very little middle ground.  Like, there's very little middle ground with you.  I know.  You never get that with other filmmakers.  Like, even with, you know, and I'm not going to put myself in such rarefied company as Steven  Spielberg, but you got people that are like, yeah, he's good.  Yeah.  Or like, he's awesome.  Or like, I don't like his stuff.  Yeah, I've seen some of his movies.  Yeah, it's all right.  But no, it's like across the boards. 
[02:06:00]  There's gray area.  I have apparently no gray area.  It's love, hate.  It is kind of.  That's it.  Let's say hi to Earl in New York.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Your name is Earl.  Hi, Earl.  Hey.  Good call.  I went past Jason about a movie he was doing with Paris Hilton.  Yes.  What about it?  Are you doing a flick?  Yeah, I already did it.  It's done.  What, Pledge this?  We'll see.  Were you holding the camera in that famous movie?  I wasn't.  I wasn't. 
[02:06:30]  I tried that, but it didn't happen.  Yeah, I already did it.  We'll see what happens.  How hard does one try?  Like, how hard did you try?  You know, I didn't really try.  Not at all?  No.  Who wants to follow Rick Solomon?  God Almighty, that was an impressive one.  Hey, Kevin's got a good question.  I'm too tiny.  I'm too tiny for that.  Why wouldn't you try?  Why wouldn't I?  She was engaged to that dude Paris or something at the time.  Yeah.  When Paris met Paris.  So, you know.  Right.  So you were being respectful?  I was. 
[02:07:00]  I try to be.  Gentleman and scholar, sir.  I try to be.  Somehow I doubt that.  Oh, sir.  Well, when it comes to Paris, Paris is like one of those, like, even though a lot of guys  have had her, you've got to, like, put her on the check, you know.  It's like a good check mark to have in your residence.  Do you guys have had her?  I think so.  Yeah.  She seems like the type.  Of course.  You know.  I don't like.  Do you buy it?  Do you think that's an act that she does?  Have you had her?  No.  Or do you think that's really her?  I think that's probably the real deal.  Well, you worked with her.  Is she, like, the way she is in, like, the simple life, or is she much smarter? 
[02:07:30]  I think she's a little smarter than she plays.  I think, yeah.  I mean, after a long time now, I'm beginning to think, like, she's just really chimping it up.  Does she have big feet?  I hear she's got, like, big feet.  I was wondering where you were going with that.  I wasn't really looking at her feet so much.  Yeah.  Did you?  It's very distracting.  Tell me.  You did see some.  Didn't you see some nudity in the makeup room, sir?  Oh, sir.  Come on.  You always get me in trouble.  I tell this guy stuff, and he spreads it all over, and next thing you know, people are  like, did you really say this? 
[02:08:00]  Um, yeah, a little bit.  I suppose whatever.  Everyone's seen it.  What'd you see, though?  How'd you pick up her dress?  She had a, uh, I don't know.  She was getting her makeup done, so she had, like, this mock or something over her thing,  but her breasts were hanging out the side.  I mean, everyone's seen it.  But I was saying it was a little more exciting.  Not live, though.  Yeah, she was sitting there, yeah, she was sitting there chatting it up with me, and  I was just, like, trying, and her makeup people were there, and I didn't want them to catch  me, so.  Peeking?  Yeah.  And the sneak peek is better.  The sneak peek is so much better. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, it's a little more exciting.  Than, like, if she was just trying to.  It's like a girl with a skirt on, you know.  Yeah, you kind of catch a peek, or the girl bends over.  I'm perverted and dirty, so we can do that.  I was at the comedy cell last night, and there's this little Russian girl walking up the steps  in a short skirt, and I actually ducked down and looked.  I'm just a little creep.  I'm 38 years old.  I'm a creep.  Hey, we've got to keep it fair here.  A lot of people checking in from Philly, defending Kid Chris.  Kid Chris had the listeners submit those questions.  They were all from them, from the listeners.  No, no, I'm just giving you a little background, and they were all meant to just bust your balls. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, and totally, and that dude, he actually, and I think I said it before, but I'll say  it again, like, to be fair, he did say I liked the movie.  Right on, yeah.  That's all that matters.  He's all right.  He's blowing up in Philly, Kid Chris.  Yeah, he is.  He's blowing up huge in Philly.  He's got big ratings.  All right, we've got something for Jimmy.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  We're going to continue on XM in a few minutes.  Is Jason coming over to XM with us?  Yeah, I wonder what this is.  Yeah, we're all going.  All right, right on.  What's his name?  Is it nudity?  Please tell me.  I hope so.  We're going to do the walkover in a few minutes. 
[02:09:30]  We've got Jimmy Day t-shirts for everybody, OzFest tickets for most of the people.  Rich Voss might be doing some comedy, and we'll continue the show on XM Satellite Radio.  It is nudity, sir.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Get them a mic.  Get them a mic.  Who's the...  Yeah.  Look at Jimmy.  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  There's two male strippers in the studio for Jim Norton's birthday. 
[02:10:00]  Happy birthday, dear Jim.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  How old are you now?  How old are you now?  Am I blushing?  Somebody's got to drill a hole for Jimmy to look at them.  I'm so glad they didn't touch me.  They're strong enough to hold me down.  It's not gay if I yell stop.  Jim, it was the one time I've ever seen you look...  You looked uncomfortable.  Yeah, because it's like, you know, I don't... 
[02:10:30]  Gee, I wonder why.  Yeah, I don't know.  Just two burly men come in, and I'm like, well, please, stay down, stay down.  You beat me to it.  I hate you.  Blow the candles out, Jim.  Oh, blow the candles out.  Yeah.  There you go.  Aw, that's adorable.  Thanks, Tom, very much.  Two little candles.  Thanks, everybody.  This always makes for great radio.  Yeah, yeah.  My birthday, Kay.  That's wonderful.  It's my birthday, too, guys.  Is it really?  No. 
[02:11:00]  Jimmy was pulling that, like, all year, saying it was his birthday every day, but today  it really is.  All right.  What is Elo going to do for you?  Anything?  Look at this.  Nice cake.  Nice cake.  Look at this.  Celebrities.  I think they got breakfast for us today.  Oh, really?  How about that, Tom?  Playing up the two companies is great.  Breakfast for us today.  It's like being a child of divorce.  All right.  We're going to continue on XM Satellite Radio.  We want to thank Joel Siegel for calling.  We were really surprised.  Well, we called him, but we want to thank him for coming on the show so Kevin Smith can 
[02:11:30]  beat him up a little bit.  In front of Kevin and being proud yet apologizing for his actions.  I don't think I did anything wrong, but I'm sorry.  If you're not going to join us on XM, make sure you see Clerks 2.  Friday.  Friday.  This Friday.  Friday.  And you guys are going to have to voice Brian and Jeff in studio on Friday.  Yeah.  Oh, this Friday?  Nice.  Oh, very cool.  That'll be fun as well.  Very cool.  All right, guys.  Thanks to the staff for singing and getting into this.  Happy birthday, sir.  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  I was really hoping they brought in the lady.  Yeah, really.  What are the girls?  I've made that mistake.  All right.  We're out of here.  Billy, keep your fingers crossed for us today.  We'll see you tomorrow.  This day is a wonderful pastime embraced by Opie and Anthony fans all over the globe.  Some people, however, fail to see the joy in this time-honored tradition.  In the spirit of fairness, we offer them this platform to voice their opinions to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:12:30]  Introducing Irate Keyboarding Person.  Dear Opie and Anthony, why do you guys always have to talk about Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  I don't want to see strange boobies.  The only boobies I want to see are the ones on my lovely bride, Eunice.  Or the ones on my back.  I really need to see a doctor. 
[02:13:00]  I think there's this.  If the thought of seeing Megan Breast upsets you this much, we submit to you that there may be a larger issue you're not dealing with.  For more information on Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, or to get a WOW sticker, visit OpieAndAnthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:13:30]  Are we on?  Yeah.  We're on.  Happy birthday to you.  I hope so.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  La la la la.  Woo!  Wait, we're not on the radio. 
[02:14:00]  We don't hear.  Son of a bitch.  Uh, uh, uh.  Are we on the radio?  Hello?  Hold on.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Hello?  You hear anything?  Why would they work?  Why would they work?  Wish I knew if we were on.  So we need to be, uh.  Why would it work for that perfect?  Yeah.  Got it.  Uh.  You guys hear us?  Okay.  All right, I guess we're on.  We just can't hear ourselves.  We can't hear ourselves for whatever reason.  Oh, wait, wait.  Now maybe we can.  No, I can't. 
[02:14:30]  Why?  Can somebody, uh.  Oh, no.  Is someone getting a feed?  Huh?  Oh, you do hear us talking?  All right, good.  You're saying hello, hello, you're not on the air.  Okay, you got a little satellite.  Now we gotta listen.  No, we can hear you saying hello, hello, we're not on the air.  I feel like a douche in this hat.  You are.  Did you hear that?  You're on.  You can't hear yourself for no reason.  You're on the air.  All right, I guess we're on.  Hey, fuck it.  We're on.  All right.  Fuck it.  We're outside Free FM. 
[02:15:00]  We have a lot of people out here for Jimmy's birthday.  With signs and balloons.  And birthday hats.  And birthday hats.  And little birthday, uh, those, those stupid horn things.  Noisemakers.  Oh, it's wonderful.  And I'm wearing a fucking, I feel ridiculous.  Well, it says turn it around because it's on backwards, you idiot.  It says birthday princess on the front.  And it looks like a little princess hat. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, there go the balloons.  There go the birthday balloons.  Wow, look at all the birthday balloons.  They're now all over the place.  Wait, I put my hat on.  I'm cutting them around.  Wait, we got a piñata, Jimmy.  There's a piñata.  Wow, yeah, put it on the right way because it says birthday princess on the front.  Yeah, but that's so the guy can read it from behind.  Yeah, and so the guy fucking him in the ass can read it.  Yeah, birthday princess.  Bend over.  All right, fam, what do we got today? 
[02:16:00]  We got a lot of stuff for Jimmy Day today.  We got a piñata.  We got balloons.  We got noisemakers.  We got signs.  Wow, everything we just described.  Yeah, basically.  What do you want from me?  Confetti.  You didn't mention the confetti.  Oh, we got confetti and silly string.  And the pal talks here.  The pal talks here.  What a lovely party, isn't it?  What a lovely party.  It's everything Jimmy could ask for.  It certainly is.  And it smells like dead animals.  It smells like dead animals.  Right here where we're standing. 
[02:16:30]  It's nothing I would ask for.  I think the homeless urinate right in this little place that we're standing in, which is just wonderful.  Should we try to move everything around?  Yes, maybe.  Wait, Club Soda Kenny wants to say something.  Oh, good.  Are we doing the Voss thing at McDonald's?  Across the street?  Are you going to do comedy today, Voss?  At McDonald's?  It's up to you guys.  Where's Kevin and Jason, too?  Or you want to go to Route 57?  They'd like us there.  That was kind of a nightmare there.  That's why we want to go back.  You want to go back there or McDonald's?  It's up to you.  You guys make the call. 
[02:17:00]  No, it's weird.  There's about 200 fans over here.  And Kevin Smith is over there by himself on the sidewalk waiting to do the walkover.  Everyone say hi to Kevin Smith.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi.  And Jason Mews, of course, too.  So, all right, I guess we have a special way for Jimmy to get to XM today.  Is that what I'm hearing?  Where is that?  Let's walk this way.  Hopefully it's under Happy Happy Girl's dress.  That would be a fine way to get to XM. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  We're hearing gunfire, people.  I believe the president has been shot.  Wow, this is a big crowd.  Confetti is in my face.  This is wonderful.  And this guy is taking more pictures of me.  No problem.  That's what I do.  That's all right.  That's what he does.  This is remarkable.  Is it?  That all the evil came out on Jimmy's birthday.  Oh, thank you very much, Miss.  They're all mission work.  I'm 38 years young.  Ha-ha.  LOL.  But the worst part is we can't hear what each other is saying, so I don't want to be stepping 
[02:18:00]  all over everybody.  No, we've got to stay close.  What is that?  We should cross over here.  Oh, nice, man.  Thank you.  Oh, there's a special mode of transportation.  Oh, I get it.  All right.  Well, the light's green.  Did he really cross?  200 people can make it across before it turns red again.  Hey, God.  Could someone carry this?  I'll give my...  Thank you very much.  That's all right.  All right.  Cool.  Just go.  Oh, boy.  Everyone moves.  All right.  This is great.  They're holding up. 
[02:18:30]  Now we don't know when anybody's talking.  Look at this.  I'd be pissed if I was driving.  I'd be yelling, guy.  Man, we really needed the...  I know.  We need the headsets working today.  And they're not.  Thank you, sir.  That asshole at the building made him take that fucking satellite thing down.  Is that what this is about?  I don't know.  I have to keep eye contact with you guys so I know when you're talking.  I know.  So we're not yapping over each other.  Jimmy, this is how you're getting Tex-M today.  Oh. 
[02:19:00]  Look at that.  It's one of those bike cabs.  Okay.  There you go.  So I have to sit in that?  You have to sit in that with your princess hat on.  With the princess hat on, yes.  But I can't talk because we can't hear each other.  Well, we'll be right next to you.  And we want you guys to sing happy birthday all the way to Tex-M.  Jimmy.  Hey.  Can you guys get a lot?  Hi, sir.  What the hell is this?  Jimmy.  Somebody walking with a ladder.  It's my birthday.  All right.  It's really hard to hear each other, unfortunately. 
[02:19:30]  I hope this is...  You're welcome, buddy.  Jimmy is trying to like something.  Yeah, go ahead, man.  Could you wear a tighter shirt?  Jesus Christ.  People getting their pictures with Jimmy.  Jimmy's in one of those bicycle cabs.  Thank you.  You look like me.  It's like a rickshaw with a bicycle on the front.  All right.  Let's take off to Tex-M.  Onward.  I'm ready, sir.  Let's go.  We have to go slow. 
[02:20:00]  This is ridiculous.  Jimmy's waving to the crowd as confetti is pouring down on top of him.  There's balloons, a festive crowd, and Jimmy waving like the queen as he is being peddled.  It looks like a gay parade.  It really does look like a faggot parade.  Birthday princess coming through.  These are the gayest birthday hats I've ever seen. 
[02:20:30]  You look great, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  I feel fat.  I feel fat.  Well, look around.  And we're at a magazine stand.  You want a copy of your favorite magazine?  No, I don't like honcho.  Honcho?  No.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, thank you, mister.  Thank you, madam.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  Jimmy.  Oh, extra pink. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, thank you.  Some extra pink.  I'm so happy.  Sorry.  I keep getting knocked on me.  I keep getting knocked on me.  Yes.  Cook.  What's that?  Cook.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Your son is attempting.  Thanks.  To bring a bicyclist into this situation.  Broke back, Jeter.  I love that shirt.  That guy doesn't like birthdays.  It's my birthday, mister.  It's his birthday.  It's my birthday. 
[02:21:30]  Happy birthday.  Go, Paula.  Go, Paula.  Yeah.  Are you feeling silly, Jimmy?  Oh, I feel like a horse's ass.  Yeah.  I love it.  The hat.  The fucking, this gentleman.  I know.  All we need is a gunshot and Jimmy's brains to be on the back of the rickshaw with me crawling  up trying to grab the little pieces of skull.  As long as the blood doesn't fly.  Someone should hold up a Stemmons freeway sign and you should film me going behind it 
[02:22:00]  with my princess hat.  Oh, it's so funny.  We got two really big celebrities today and this is the nonsense they have to deal with.  This is the drivel.  Yeah.  Clerks 2 opens Friday.  They're over there by themselves.  That's very funny.  Joe Siegel just walked out on your party.  What's that?  Oh, it's my birthday, miss.  Play along.  It's just a little rape.  It's his birthday.  You twat. 
[02:22:30]  Just waiting for the light to turn here.  I'm stuck behind a car.  Everyone hates me.  These.  Oh, I love you.  But I mean the people I'm driving to work.  Yeah, exactly.  Did you like the male dancers?  Did I like the male dancers?  I was so paranoid they were going to touch me.  Yeah, you were really creeped out.  Yeah.  It was funny, though.  I mean, that's the way it should be.  It's good to know that you're not gay.  That proved it today.  Not at all.  Did you need proof?  So what?  Can't judge a man by a few dozen incidents. 
[02:23:00]  All right, we're on our way to XM.  We're crossing the street.  There's a big Pepsi truck who's causing a big ruckus.  There's got to be a couple hundred people with us today for this.  This is really embarrassing.  Wawa penis sign.  Wawa penis sign is my favorite.  Excuse me, sir.  Birthday procession coming through.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  Birthday procession.  You savage.  Let him through.  Wow, even more people waiting.  Yeah, stand up and wave, Jimmy.  There you go. 
[02:23:30]  That's it, Jimmy.  Wave.  There you go.  Stand up and wave, Jimmy.  Do you know, it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile a gang of people in  faggity hats once told me.  Oh, there's a police car.  I don't know if we should pass.  We're going to have to get around this police vehicle.  Oh, he's moving.  Oh, he's moving.  Very nice.  And that nice pull up right behind. 
[02:24:00]  I guess that's Pat from Munaki's van.  We'll get one outside.  Don't worry.  Oh, this is great.  We should go through a tunnel.  We know how that worked the last time someone in a princess hat did that.  Say happy birthday.  Happy birthday from Brazil.  It's my birthday, short foreign person.  Hi, mister.  Oh, thank you very much.  Jimmy!  Ooh!  Jimmy!  Wait. 
[02:24:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Dirty magazines.  Yes.  It's my birthday!  It's pandemonium.  That dirty cabbie.  Hi, fella.  Good, thank you.  How are you?  Oh, no.  Short, short, short, short.  Oh, perfect.  Perfect.  Jimmy, over here.  Thank you very much, man.  We can't hear each other, so we've got to get everyone together.  Oh, we've got to give out OzFest tickets?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Jimmy, come over here.  Oh, where are we giving them out?  Over here?  All right.  We have to give out OzFest tickets.  We're going to back up because we're in front of the building.  Okay.  Oh, someone got you a porno pack.  Yes.  Dirty magazines.  Nice.  Let's back up.  Filthy magazines.  Pornographic.  Hello, madam.  It's my birthday.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  Wish him a happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  There you go.  Can you carry this for me?  Everyone loves Jimmy.  I'll get into it.  Wow.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, guys, very much.  Well, I see a lot of people getting the Jimmy Day shirts. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, they're handing out shirts.  It's my birthday, madam.  Oh, look at her.  The little short lady wants one.  How cute is she?  She'll use it.  You've got to fly the line down this way.  Down this way.  Down this way.  Down this way.  What is she?  Down this way.  Look at the little short lady.  I know.  The little engine girl.  She thinks she has to clean it.  That's great.  She's going to bring it back in an hour on a hanger.  We're going to do this, Jimmy.  We're going to form a line.  Everyone's going to get their Jimmy Day t-shirt, some OzFest tickets, and they can wish you  a happy birthday.  Okay, thanks.  Let's do that. 
[02:26:00]  Form a line.  That's right.  Down this way for the line.  Jimmy will be giving out the t-shirts and the OzFest tickets.  Why?  Rep lively.  Down this way.  Thank you, sir.

That's fat.  Pat is sweet.  Hey, Pat.  How's your stomach?  Feels pretty good.  I was like, we're on XM, right?  I was shitting until about 11 o'clock last night, and then I was like, yeah, I feel pretty  good.  Oh, okay.  I'm down for a Jimmy day.  Good for you.  What are we going to do with the piñata, by the way?  I squeal with delight.  Wasn't that Joel Siegel's review of deliverance?

[02:31:00]  Ozfest ticket.  It's all for PNC, right?  Yeah.  Oh, no, no, no.  Randall's Island.  When is Randall's Island?  Ozzie is headlining the second stage.  29th of July?  July 29th.

I appreciate you coming.  Thank you.  Happy birthday, man.  All right.  How are you, buddy? 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Cool.  Hey, happy birthday, man.  Thank you very much, man.  Enjoy the show.  Happy birthday, Jimmy and Bobby Reels.  You stink.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Jimmy, can you sign this for a cocksucker who couldn't make it today?  Sure.  Thank you.  You have a word signing, Jimmy.  What are you signing?  It looks like a copy of my first CD, Yellow Discipline.  That was the fucking worst pen to sign something with.  Available at eatabullet.com.  That's right.  He gave you a dolly.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Here's my little Jimmy for you.  Oh, thank you.  I also got you the postcard.  The guy with the effeminate shirt has it.

It's going to take days to wash out the baby while I just listen to bad advice. 
[02:32:30]  Bad advice.  But anyway, Jimmy, I hope your birthday's a great one.  Thank you very much.  And the fucking two dancers are seeing the chicks that have approached me so far.

Yes.  A salute.  Where's the piñata?  Can we kick that around a little bit like a dog or what? 
[02:33:30]  Hey, where's the piñata?  Like a dog.  Pat's got it.  He's got it.  What's inside this thing?  I don't know what it's supposed to be.  The ACT.  Huh?  What's in there, Pat?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's only one way to find out.  Yeah, someone's got to kick it.  Throw it on the ground there.  All right.  We'll call the piñata Chester.  Let's call the...  All right.  Here we go.  Let's just call him Chester.  All right.  And see...  Should I kick it? 
[02:34:00]  You kick it.  I think it's better if you kick it.  I would definitely move out of the way.  No, Pat.  All right.  I think Opie should kick it.  Oh.  A good, firm kick to the liver.  All right.  I did all right.  A good kick to the liver.  All right, Jimmy.  Why don't you do the honors there, Jimmy?  Kick it.  Should I kick it?  Yeah.  Give it a good one.  Kick it.  Don't kick it like a fag.  Oh, its head came off.  Oh, I broke its little dog neck.  Pink gum.  Gum.  Oh. 
[02:34:30]  It's full of that pink gum.  Oh, yay.  Now no one will wait until it's on the dirty ground.  I caught one that didn't...  Yay.  I caught one that didn't hit the ground.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  It's not him.  Not good.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you very much.  It's a special day for a special boy.  Take your bubble gum.  It's all over the floor. 
[02:35:00]  Take some bubble gum.  All right.  As we walk now up to our doorway.  You know what?  It has to be said.  We have the greatest fans in radio.  The fucking best, man.  And someday they'll show up.  Oh, look at this little...  Instead of the creeps that show up every day.  Hi, it's my birthday, ladies.  It's my birthday.  Jimmy's birthday.  Hi.  Jimmy's birthday.  Say happy birthday to Jimmy.  Hi.  Lady, no?  I'm the birthday person.  What do you got against Jimmy Norton?  Yeah.  You want to drop a log on me?

Oh, more kids being there.  Getting some Kiss memorabilia.  Yeah, living out here, yeah.  Nice.  The second Kiss comic book.  Which looks like you transported it under a car.  Thank you.  Good you didn't have one in mid-condition.  Thank you very much.  Ah, too good.  Yes.  This one's about $300 to $500, depending on what kind of sucker you can kind of get. 
[02:36:00]  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  If you'd like, you can kind of have this, or you can take a little hammer, a little smack.  I'm not going to break that.  Fascinating conversation.  Are you giving me that?  Yeah, I'm not breaking that, dude.  This is the Kiss comic.  Thank you very much.  Jimmy.  No, I won't break that, man.  Before we go upstairs, Club Show to Kenny, everyone.  Listen to Club Show to Kenny.  Thank you very much, man.  All right, listen up, folks.  Thank you.  As a special treat, there's going to be a photo op with the birthday boy and his two 
[02:36:30]  special friends.  Oh!  They got 15 seconds.  You got 15 seconds, so act like paparazzi.  All right, here we go.  Wait, let's get away from the front door.  Because Schumer of the Holocaust is standing there watching Schumer.  Wow.  Right under this tree.  Okay.  All righty.  Wait, on three.  Jimmy in the middle.  Hold on, we'll turn around. 
[02:37:00]  On three.  Kenny, on three.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Snap away.  Oh, there they are.  There they are for Jimmy Day.  They're taking their pictures.  Jimmy is waving with his birthday hat on.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  It's my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, everybody.  Is that it, Kenny?  That's enough for these people.  All right.  All right, get lost.  Get lost.  Out of the way.  There you go.  Out of the way. 
[02:37:30]  Out of the way.  Clear the field.  Clear the field.  Out of the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, we got to get upstairs and continue the rest of the show.  Come on.  That was a lot of fun.  Wow.  Someone take it for you.  A lot of...  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's going to be out here for a while.  Thank you.  I'm inside.  Are you putting his hand down like this?  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Had it with my public.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's stuck out there.  Jimmy's stuck outside.  Oh, no, Jimmy's not. 
[02:38:00]  All kidding aside, we got to say it again.  The greatest fans in radio.  Absolutely.  The greatest fans in radio.  Dude, thanks so much, man.  Hundreds of people showed up for Jimmy's birthday today.  Yeah, give me the comic.  I'll hold it.  Listen to him.  He's still working it.  Oh, I'm hopping in that elevator.  I'm holding it up.  Da-dee-dee-da-dee-da-dee-da.  There we go.  Five, please.  Jimmy, just keep talking.  It's okay.  We'll be up there.  Don't cut us out, though.  Let Jimmy talk for a while.  All right.  He's snapping a photo of me holding the comic. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  Okay.  Thanks very much.  All right.  I got to go upstairs.  All right.  We're walking up right now.  Thank you very much, guys, for coming.  Thank you, sir.  Let me have one.  Thank you.  What nice people they are.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  Mel Carmisen?  All right.  Let this guy go through.  He works here.  Thank you, sir.  And thanks to Debbie for the hat. 
[02:39:00]  That was really nice.  Where's the iPod?  What great fans.  Eric has it.  We have great fans, man.  Dedicated.  We're running out of things, so go to commercial or whatever you do.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM 202.  O.P. and Anthony.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  One couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex, sex, sex.  Good morning.  Based on a dare from radio hosts here in New York. 
[02:39:30]  Hello.  They fired these two guys.  For orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic cathedral.  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony had encouraged the couple to have sex at locations where a producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  Opie and Anthony were fired and their nationally syndicated show canceled.  Did these shock jocks simply go too far?  When it crossed the line.  This is outrageous.  Just, oh dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just when everything was going good.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I like jam bags on the toll. 
[02:40:00]  And Anthony.  I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  And presided over the slaughter of a wild period.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encouraged teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  It's screwing everything up.  Shock Jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form, the nerve of these people to actually have it as a set-up. 
[02:40:30]  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  They'll be an Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That was awesome.  Not too shabby.  So much love for Jimmy.  So much love for Jim Norton.  He's still out there.  Hundreds of listeners showed up for Jimmy's birthday.  They all got Ozfest tickets for the Randall's Island Show here in New York, July 29th, I believe. 
[02:41:00]  They got Jimmy Day t-shirts.  If you didn't get yours, you can go to MyRadioStore.com.  Actually, all the Opie and Anthony t-shirts are up there.  MyRadioStore.com.  Kevin Smith and Jason Mews in studio.  Yeah, hanging out.  Isn't it Wednesday?  And it's working on Wednesday.  Thank you, Kevin.  How come there's no whipping out on the street there?  Well, it was all guys.  You know, there was like, we have a slight problem with our audience.  We love them, but they're all guys.  It's a fucking cock fest. 
[02:41:30]  It really is a sausage party.  Every time we go out, do an appearance or something, it's like, when girls show up,  we're like, oh, whoa, it's a girl.  And it's just, dude, love it, fucking dude.  You're great, dude, dude.  How many girls are out there?  With a cock.  There were a couple girls.  Two, not counting Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Two, maybe three.  Old E.T. body.  The baby oil in her hair.  Yeah, the baby oil in her hair and the E.T. body.  Yeah.  Is she in here?  She's right outside the studio.  Rich Voss has made it upstairs. 
[02:42:00]  What happened to Jimmy?  Still out there?  He's in the bathroom with the strippers.  Oh, with the men?  With the men.  With the men.  Guys getting to know each other.  How great are those people?  They're just like, they're such true fans, man.  Yeah, you got to give them props.  We beat them up every day, but you got to step out of character every once in a while, man.  Those are unbelievable.  They are very passionate.  The greatest fans on radio.  Bastards.  The greatest fans on radio.  The passion is unbelievable.  Happy Typing Girls here today. 
[02:42:30]  She had that whole thing on Pal Talk, but for half the time, the camera was upside down.  What?  Yeah.  What is Happy Typing Girl?  She's just another uber fan.  Fan.  Because everything we do now has to be on Pal Talk.  Like, everything we do.  I remember last time I was here, there was sex on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Sex going on.  Guy tasered his asshole on Pal Talk once.  It's hysterical.  It started with just his wife or chick, whoever it was, was tasering him. 
[02:43:00]  And he would just drop to the floor, and it was great.  So he pulls his pants down and shows his asshole, and his wife shoves the taser up his ass,  the stun gun, and hit it, and he flew forward, and his head went through the sheetrock.  Funniest shit I've ever seen on Pal Talk up to date.  It looked like, remember in Easy Money when Roddy's riding the stationary bike and he goes  into the Christmas tree?  Yeah.  That was the type of great, unexpected moment it was.  He just flew.  What if this is a dude to be like, do it, hit me in the asshole.  Hit me in the asshole with a stun gun. 
[02:43:30]  A dude is sitting there going, like, well, don't hit me in the balls.  Yeah, not the balls.  Just the asshole.  Don't cross the taint area.  Speaking of assholes, sir, the interview, I believe it was in Maxim.  Oh, we can finally get into that.  That's right.  We can do that over there.  Oh, shit.  You did an interview where it was about your hemorrhoid.  Oh, yeah.  No, what I did was I wrote a blog about it, and it ran an arena.  They just published the blog.  Right, okay.  And I did the anal fissure story.  The talk about the hemorrhoid, I had read, like, years ago, National Lampoon, and I used 
[02:44:00]  to get to the point where I couldn't, I'd have to shut, like, shut it, because I was laughing  too hard and couldn't breathe.  Right.  Same thing happened reading the hemorrhoid thing.  Thank you.  It's so heinous and disgusting and hysterically funny.  It's bad.  How old is everyone?  How old are you?  Yeah, like, 40, 44, 45, 43.  Well, normally, I tell this little joke at parties.  They say, how old are you?  I say 29 again.  The whole place laughs.  I'm 38 today. 
[02:44:30]  38 today.  And, yeah, I mean, I don't know if anyone else has problems shitting lately, but it's  just not as easy as, yeah?  I'm telling you, the cure is-  Once every three days.  It's fucking simple, sir.  Metamucil.  Really?  Have you ever had Metamucil?  Are you at that point?  Yes.  And that makes me feel like I went to the proctologist for the first time in my life  when I had the anal fissure thing going on, and the proctologist's like, just do two spoonfuls  of Metamucil every morning.  I'm like, that's a granny fucking thing to do, dude.  Right.  But it's amazing.  That works.  It is astounding.  Does it make your logs all soupy and stuff? 
[02:45:00]  It's all- It's not soupy, but it's like, basically, the doctor was like, it'll give your shit the  consistency of Play-Doh.  I'm like, how do you know that?  Play-Doh.  Yeah.  But it's-  Your shit barely is holding to the test.  Where if you really listen, it makes almost that snap, crackle, pop, rice, crispy sound  coming out?  Yeah.  As it comes out.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  It is the smoothest, easiest shit I've ever done in my life.  You ever get a colonic?  I have gotten a colonic.  That helps your logs, too, because it fucking cleans out the pipes, and the next thing you  know, you got fucking perfect- They're supposed to, and I read this, be the consistency of 
[02:45:30]  toothpaste and the length of a banana, and it's supposed to slip into the water and just  gently sink to the bottom.  I'm telling you, I read that.  That's what a fucking healthy log does.  That's what a shit's supposed to be, yeah.  Like a snake, a moray eel poking out of your toilet bowl.  When I smoked it-  With a little curvature in it.  Yeah, of course.  It's not going to come out straight.  Is it like a laxative, like will it just hit you all of a sudden?  Well, what it does is it does both things.  It binds you up, it doesn't bind you up in as much as you can shit, but it makes your  shit kind of stick together, and it also is something of a laxative as well. 
[02:46:00]  Sitting there trying to dump out a box of milk duds.  Totally.  You're listening to a junior radio now.  Totally.  Like rabbit shit by rabbit shit.  Yeah.  And you know there's more up there, but it ain't coming out.  The fucking worst is when I have a massage girl coming over, and they always work on  your asshole, so I try to squeeze a shit out first.  What?  What kind of massage girl works on the asshole?  Oh.  The fucking ones on Craigslist.  The only ones worth a seeing.  The rest of them are just fucking annoying, two touchy-feely cop pieces.  But the worst is when you can't fucking get a log out, and you've got to fucking like 
[02:46:30]  break it off and wipe, and there's still a pound left, and you know it's going to stink  when she opens your cheek.  The truth, dude.  I'm showering.  So what do you think?  You go back to this.  So you get a massage, and they do the full body massage, and take it right to that muscle  as well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, that is genius.  You massages your sphincter?  Well, they rub it.  It's a muscle.  Like, what better place to massage?  Ab, it's the only thing.  They could fucking save themselves 50 minutes to work with me.  Tease the asshole, jerk me off, and go.  I'll never go.  You forgot the shoulders.  Your mom can do your shoulders. 
[02:47:00]  Absolutely.  Or the asshole if she don't choose.  Tease the asshole.  In that same blog, you talk about how, yeah, you had a rip in your ass, and the only way  to really see if it was bad was to spread your cheeks and ask your wife.  So I had to finally break down and be like, and I've never, like, my wife hasn't even seen  me with my fucking shirt off in eight years together.  Really?  Yeah, because I'm like, who needs her to see those fucking man tits?  And she's like, I married you.  I should trade up, you know? 
[02:47:30]  You don't have that much money.  So I finally said, I was like, this is killing me.  I was in pain, dude.  I was crying.  It hurt so much.  Wow.  Because you figure out pretty quickly that that little fucking ring of muscle is the  fulcrum to your entire body.  No matter what movement you make, it reverberates there for some reason.  Yeah, everything goes there.  You're going to feel it.  It fucking killed.  And there's a billion nerve endings just sitting there waiting.  It's nuts.  So I was like, you got to take a peek at it.  And she was like, you sure?  And I was like, I don't know what else to do.  Just because it felt like in my mind's eye, I was just like, this thing is just shred open.  And she's looking at it and she's like, I can't see anything really. 
[02:48:00]  Except that I don't want to be with you anymore.  And you just know the next time we were fucking, all she could see was that fucking brown eye  covered by a fucking flab and having to pull that shit aside and the hair in my asshole.  You know she was just sitting there like, fucking, I got to think of fucking Ben Affleck  or anything else.  Anything else except fucking his sphincter.  People get too comfortable, I think, in relationships and it will take away.  That's fucking love. 
[02:48:30]  If you get past that, that is love.  Totally.  And I guess that's the way to find out if it's love.  That's the moment right there.  Because I can't take a shit in front of, I've never been able to take a shit in front of girlfriends.  I don't want girls being like, I've held it in till like a girl has left or something  where I won't shit in the house just so the smell won't come out.  But there are people that just, you know, hey, she's taking a dump.  Hey, spread open your legs, I got to piss. 
[02:49:00]  You know, piss in between her legs.  She's taking a shit.  Bonnie was fingering my ass and felt the hemorrhoid.  And brings it up?  And brought it up so I feel something in it?  You know, you feel something.  She felt the speed bump.  And then you, like, you don't know you have them, but you take a shit and all of a sudden  you look and there's blood all in the ball.  What the hell are you doing?  No, it ain't that bad.  There's two different kinds of blood.  If you've got dark red, that's like an internal problem.  I've heard that, right?  That's bad.  It's just the top.  It's not a bad deal. 
[02:49:30]  It's worked its way through the system.  It's turned brown.  It's like, yeah, that totally black.  And if it's just your asshole, it's just going to be, you know.  There's nothing more scary than.  Vampire bite red.  There's nothing more scary than looking at a ball and seeing blood.  Totally.  And you're like, I'm fucking dying.  I'm fucking dying.  I mean, I had a camera put in my ass, the whole thing, man.  Oh, they did it.  It's still there?  That's right.  It's a Polaroid.  He kicked me out of the van.  Paniflex.  I got an observation here, by the way.  We got the guys from Clerks 2, and the guy that's usually very silent in the films is 
[02:50:00]  doing all the talking.  Jason is the silent one today.  You're just taking it all in, Jason?  It's how it is in real life.  What's your observation?  What are you thinking?  This is a pretty crazy radio show.  I was thinking about when I used to have, I had hemorrhoids constantly when I was doing  dope, because you get constipated, so it's no big thing.  Yeah.  This guy's crying.  I lived with a hemorrhoid for eight years straight.  Why don't you?  How come you don't shit when you're on dope? 
[02:50:30]  Because you're, um...  You get bound up.  Yeah.  Because I think your muscles are so relaxed, so you're not really...  Coke doesn't do that, though.  No.  Coke doesn't do that.  It makes you shit the second you're fucking...  Oh, yeah.  It makes you shit.  You're just shit.  You have a painkiller.  That's black.  You get constipated.  Feeling shit like once a week, and it's like a baseball.  You're holding on to the towel rack.  It's no fun.  It's no fun.  Old John Wayne colon.  I don't know what this guy's talking about.  A little cut in his bunghole.  Yeah, he thinks your story is cute there, Kevin. 
[02:51:00]  I read...  I read a story.  I got been through pain, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  I read a little bit about you, though, with having some kind of crabs or something that  you got from some chick and...  No, never crabs, sir.  What was it?  It was some kind of parasite, I think, and Kevin was commenting, did you tell the girl  or...  No, I don't...  It was something...  It's probably another thing Kevin tells.  You know, I tell Kevin some private shit, and he tells everyone in front of 2,000 people.  Why is that bad? 
[02:51:30]  Why is that bad?  It's a Q&A, and then it's...  You know, whatever.  I just did read, because, you know, there's a lot of stuff out there about you guys, whether  it's true or not, but...  I never had any...  You never had any issues or nothing?  How about this?  Going with that, what's the craziest question, you guys...  Not the question, the craziest thing you heard you did that you didn't on the internet  or something?  I once read that I was working on Superman's script like 10 years ago, and I read  a story where I was maintaining, after I wrote the script, that I wanted to be in  the movie and play Superman.  I showed up at Warner Brothers wearing a Superman costume. 
[02:52:00]  I remember that.  And I was just like, what?  That's not true?  Gee.  I mean, I don't even know where to begin.  What part of that story is not true?  Like, what weird world would I ever want to be, like, in the movie as Superman?  As anybody, you know, really?  It was kind of...  That was a strange thing.  And then to go to the extent of getting a costume and putting it on.  And showing up.  Because you always hear those stupid stories.  Fucking gut hanging out of the blue suit and over the belt.  Yeah.  So you'd have to get yourself in shape.  You're like Superman in front of the Chinese theater and shit. 
[02:52:30]  That dude.  Fucking Superman.  Oh, that guy.  Have you guys been out to Hollywood right now?  Yeah.  Those guys near us.  It's insane now.  Everybody, like, hawking...  It's because anybody could do it.  Like, I used to think it was kind of some licensed thing that the Grohman's Chinese theater  hired him.  But no, people just show up.  And they're real territorial about it.  Very.  They get tight, man.  Like, one guy will be Superman, yeah.  And he'll kick the shit out of another Superman if he comes over there.  That would be awesome.  That would be awesome.  It would be like watching Superman... 
[02:53:00]  What was that?  Superman 3 when he fought himself.  And Richard Pryor was there.  And apparently there's this big Elmo.  That black guy.  Dirty Elmo.  Filthy Elmo.  It just stinks.  It's the scariest thing.  And then every once in a while you'll see him like, it gets really hot.  The dude takes off his head and he's sitting there.  Elmo body, human head.  Yeah, human head.  Confusing every child.  Like, they don't know which one they're more distressed by.  When he's filthy with the dirty t-shirt and the dirty red hair.  Or when he takes his fucking hat off and it's a dude underneath.  Do you think it smells inside that mask? 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  You got him, man.  He stinks.  And why haven't people come after those people?  Like, licensing.  You would think they would just...  I don't know.  You would imagine.  But, like, some of them are just close enough.  Like, Elmo is not like the official Elmo.  It's like some guy.  A blind dude put it together.  There's a slight difference.  It blows you.  But those two collect.  It's like 10 bucks a shot.  10 bucks a shot to get that.  Yeah, to get a picture with him.  20 the fuck out of my own amount.  Jason, what about you?  What was the craziest thing you read about yourself that wasn't true?  Nothing.  That I died? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot about that.  That is pretty crazy if you're not dead.  Twice it was in the papers that I was dead.  That you were dead.  How is that to read?  Jesus.  You know, I didn't read it.  People were telling me, though, so...  Yeah.  But, yeah, it's pretty weird.  That's kind of cool, actually.  How fucking great is that, man?  Do you get all the sympathy?  Like, oh, we thought you were gone.  No, appreciate me now.  Come back and I'm probably going to appreciate you.  Give me dope.  Free dope.  No, but I'm working on it. 
[02:54:30]  Shit, man.  How long have you been off?  Three years.  A little over three years.  Like, three years, three months.  Damn.  Wow.  Did it go quick for you?  Because it seemed to go quick for me.  I'm thinking you were just...  Not for me, because I don't do drugs.  I was dead last week.  Yeah, I thought you were dead.  No, I thought you were still...  I thought it was about a year, but wow.  Since three years.  That's pretty good.  Nice.  Look at these two.  I know.  How long?  20 years.  20 years.  20 years of what?  Well, we were...  Boss used to suck.  Such a mean cock for crack.  That's right. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, this guy.  He had sucked such great cock.  No, I never sucked a dick for crack.  I do it for...  Don't fuck yourself.  Don't fix it up.  He would never sully a good cock sucking with drugs.  All right?  20 years.  I got three off of gambling and a fucking month and two days off of cigarettes, which is tougher  than all of them.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Nice.  What was the gambling?  What was your poison?  Craps.  Like, you know, anybody...  Same with freebase.  What's left?  You gave up the drugs. 
[02:55:30]  You gave up gambling and cigarettes, but no booze.  What do you do for fun?  Fucking golf and buy clothes.  I'm a fucking dick.  I missed that part.  Darth Vader hair.  Let me tell you something.  There is a part where you need a vice, though, you know?  Well, you know, crack, you know, because, like, when you gamble, like, crack, once you  start smoking freebase and you watch somebody snorting, you're going, you're fucking wasting  it.  Right.  Same with shooting craps.  If you see somebody playing blackjack, what the fuck?  Why gamble is such a boring thing?  Shoot craps. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  Shoot the load quick and fucking have some excitement.  I mean, get high.  If you're going to get high, get fucking high.  Don't be a...  You don't understand sitting there for hours pacing yourself.  Listen, what is that?  I'm not a drug guy, so the idea of freebase is...  Is it better than snorting it?  Oh, yeah.  Snorting it's like reading a book backwards.  It's like the freebase is like fucking...  It's that...  Yeah.  Boom.  Bam.  Right there.  Yeah, right there.  And then you spend the rest of the night trying to find that first hit, which never,  ever comes.  What you got to do is just double up your next hit. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, is that...  I can just picture you sweating.  When you said Worcester when we're doing a show on Worcester, I picked a girl on Worcester.  Worcester?  Worcester, mess.  Whatever.  You don't fucking speak Worcester than anyone I've ever heard.  Horrible.  Worcester.  I was working...  When you said we're doing a tour there...  In where?  In...  Up in Mass.  Where?  In fucking Worcester.  Whatever it's called.  What the fuck do I know?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  I worked a place where plums and I picked up a waitress.  We drove back to New York from there and I copped $500 worth of coke, sat in a shitty  hotel room, fucked her and smoked coke all night and drove back up to Boston broke to  do one more night.  That's how powerful...  I mean, you would do...  The glory.  The glory of it all.  I always thought smoking was a waste when you could shoot it.  What?  He goes one better.  He just dropped you.  I poured your ass. 
[02:57:30]  So wait, the feeling of shooting it is even better than smoking it?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, sir.  Come on.  Right into...  Did you ever...  So right into the veins.  Did you ever do...  My bunghole, too.  I was going to say, did you ever do the rectal thing?  I did.  You shot in your asshole?  Yeah.  Who did it for you?  Did you do it yourself or have somebody do it for you?  Jose Canseco.  You came over.  I did it myself.  Did you by yourself?  Why?  Are you just afraid to show people your bung or no?  Don't trust them enough?  You want to know all those three guys?  I do.  Because the point broke off my syringe and I already had it loaded. 
[02:58:00]  So I didn't, you know...  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  So the point breaks off so you can't...  So you can't put it in your vein.  Yeah, so...  And I didn't...  There's a contingency plan for that?  I never know.  There's a backup plan for that?  Oh, yeah.  Up the ass?  Up the bung piece.  So wait.  So you're not injecting it into the ring?  You're sticking it in your ass and just letting the liquid flow out?  Let it sit in your intestine?  Does it leak out or anything?  Well, you got to hang upside down.  So you got to hold it and hope that the blood vessels in your lower intestine, like, absorb it? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  But you think banging it is a quicker rush than...  Smoking it?  I don't know.  I'm not...  Listen, I...  Not at all am I glorifying any of this shit.  Don't get me...  I'm just...  Yes, you are.  You look juggies.  I don't know.  That one hotel night with the...  That sounded fun.  Yeah, I was like, wow, what a night.  It sounded fun.  Oh, fucking great.  There was not one bad thing that came out of it.  No.  And then you went back to work?  No.  What's the problem?  Yeah, he was actually responsible enough to drive and finish his...  You had it all. 
[02:59:00]  What were you doing?  Sounds like a fun trip.  You're driving back to Boston from here.  You live here, but you got to drive back there.  Your nose is bleeding.  What is that, six-hour drive?  I don't know, four and a half.  It was just horrible.  Were you depressed driving back?  We went into, like, Hartford, and we tried to cop some heroin and coke.  See, that's what I imagine with the problem.  The problem is, like, trying to score.  Like, that seems to be the...  I mean, of course, there's so many downsides, but it's the hunt that I think would bug me.  Well, that's the excitement, too, is going to cop.  I mean, that's part of the excitement.  Really?  Yeah, we had a... 
[02:59:30]  See, this girl, too, like I met, she goes...  And this...  I was a drug addict then.  She goes, I want to buy an ounce of coke, my sister.  And I was going to get the money, and obviously, I would have ripped  her off, right?  Of course.  That's what you do as a drug addict.  I know.  It goes that way.  I would have ripped her off.  But four years later, thank God I didn't, I'm working a club in Florida, and she's  there with her boyfriend, who's as big as a house.  Oh, Jesus.  So if I would have ripped her off, I would have got fucking killed for her.  But that's what you think about, it's just, you know, you know, just... 
[03:00:00]  You got ripped off, didn't you, in Newark?  Yeah, a few times.  More than once?  At gunpoint, or they just took off?  No, no, they just took it.  Yeah, there's, in the hallway in Newark.  Yeah, it's no honor, man.  It's a fucking honor.  I was about to get fucked up one time.  Yeah, knife, too.  Knife, good lord.  I was in the projects in New Brunswick.  I was actually getting crack, and I was such a...  I was so drunk.  And I fucking walk into the projects, and I go up the steps.  The guy goes, come up here.  So he was going to take me up.  Oh, good idea.  I was so dumb. 
[03:00:30]  And we're on the landing way, and this guy, Rodney, I knew, who lived in the projects,  walked in and said hello to me, and we talked.  He goes, no, don't go up there, man.  Take care of him right here.  So Rodney knew it was about to happen.  Maybe he was going to give me a special deal.  The discounts are all upstairs.  When you hear stories like this, don't you just feel like, man, I've lived a really sheltered  life.  Yeah, no kidding.  Like, I used to think I was edgy, and then you hear shit like that, and I'm like, man.  I was always too afraid of jail to do anything that was really bad. 
[03:01:00]  You know, stupid stuff with knocking down mailboxes with your car or shit like that.  But I heard stories like, you know, hey, you want to take the car in?  I got to pick up a kilo in the city.  It's like, yeah, that's what I want to do.  Get caught with a kilo of fucking coke under my car seat.  All I'm thinking is, you know, oh, there I am sucking big black cock in prison.  That's the first thing that comes to your mind.  Why does it got to be about black?  Exactly.  Because there's only one thing worse than sucking white cock. 
[03:01:30]  I don't think we'll get anyone denying that.  This is hilarious.  It's just kept me out of, you know, trouble, and that kept me from doing that shit.  I wrote a bit on this.  This is true.  I pulled up in Harlem, and I go to this guy, what do you got?  And he showed me like five vials, and I snatched him out of his hand.  He punched me twice in the face.  He went, bam, bam, right.  I'm a little fucked, so I drive away.  I go, let me get the fuck out of here.  You know, I'm in Harlem, and I'm getting punked.  You're sharp, yeah.  So I'm not lying.  I'm banging on cars, and I got the five vials in my hand, or three, and I throw it in the 
[03:02:00]  pipe, and it was soap, right?  Oh, jeez.  And he's hitting me in the face for ripping him off of fucking soap, right?  So I pull back on him and go, you don't rip me off when I'm ripping you off.  He hit me over soap, you fucking douchebag.  I don't know what part of that story is more horrible.  And also, I just sit there going, all right, it's me, and I put myself in boss's shoes, and  I'm just like, the dude punches me in the face once. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And that's it.  I don't drive away.  I pass out.  You're done.  You're knocked out.  That's where the fist hits me.  I see it coming, and my nerve ending's shut down.  I've never been one for getting hit.  I go into complete physical shock.  My buddy Mike was a bodybuilder who I got sober with, and he eventually relapsed out of  a heart attack, and he's dead.  But he was getting high all the time in Harlem.  But he was in Harlem.  I didn't know when he was active, and he's a big little fucker, man.  He was a stocked...  Big little fucker.  I mean, short, but fucking...  He was a problem.  And he went up into Harlem, and he was fucking getting high, and he said he came out, and his 
[03:03:00]  car was on blocks, and he just fucking broke down and cried.  And a hooker helped him.  A prostitute actually helped him.  I try to sell my friend's car.  When he lent me his car, I pull it.  I go...  You were really, really wrong.  I got the radio.  I got the radio out.  Very deep.  Oh, we got out of the car.  I went up there with comics, Keith Barony, some guy.  And I get out of the car.  There's no lie.  There's a guy chasing another guy around the car with a butcher knife.  And so the guy goes, don't get out of the car. 
[03:03:30]  I go, he's not fucking after me.  There's another thing going on.  I walk by and I go, what's happening?  And I had the keys to the front doors in place this day.  I mean, it was just...  It was so fucking crazy.  We took David Spade hostage.  When he first came to New York, when he was a con.  He was from Arizona.  He's this little white kid.  He's doing props.  So we're doing a gig, me and Frankie Bastille.  Right?  Frankie's a heroin addict, and I'm a crack addict.  So we're driving, and David Spade is coming with us to this gig.  On the way back from Jersey, we said to him, hey, look, we've got to make a couple stops. 
[03:04:00]  And he's this little timid guy then.  And I go, look, I've got to go up and see my sister.  She lives uptown.  So I go up to Cop Crack up in like 158th and after whatever.  He's on 57th.  Right?  And this guy's frightened to death.  He's there.  He's from Arizona.  Then Frankie goes to the lower east side.  Right?  And he's like, can you drop me off?  And we go, hey, we've got shit to do.  I'm driving.  I'm driving.  He's sitting in the front seat, and Frankie's in the back banging dope. 
[03:04:30]  Right?  He's going, look, I just want to get out of here.  Dude's like, bye-bye.  And, you know, you've got to do what you've got to do first.  Did you all make it to the gig?  That was after the gig.  Sounds like another fine story where no one got hurt.  At the end of the day, everyone gets to their job.  Nice David Spade story.  It's a cute story, but fast forward 15 years.  Rich David.  Does this shit bug you at all, Jason? 
[03:05:00]  Like, talking about it?  No?  Did it years ago?  Like, when you first, maybe your first year?  It's not like smoking when you...  I mean, if I'm around it, I mean, if I, like, I've went out and been around people doing  coke and stuff, and that bothers me.  It just makes me more sick, because I see what I was doing, and it's just retarded.  Like, just like stories like that, just doing the stupidest stuff, like ending up, and the  nights, like, if I was at a club, I just wanted to do drugs all night.  So I'd go home with these random people and just be, like, in the middle of nowhere, like, 
[03:05:30]  and then they'd run out of coke, and I want more.  Everyone's, like, going right to sleep.  I'd be like, man, let's get more.  And just thinking, like, man, we're going to bed, and I'd be like, stop, because I  wouldn't know where I was, like, an hour from, like, wherever, you know.  All you cared about was getting there, yeah.  And, like, going two and three in the morning to Elizabeth and the projects, and hanging  out in shooting galleries with, like, people nodding out next to you, don't know, and shit.  So when you're copping in New York, it's a little more glamorous. 
[03:06:00]  You go to Harlem and stuff.  In Jersey, you go to Elizabeth.  I mean, it was a horrible time, and so glad that it's over, but there were, like, moments  that, in retrospect, are, like, really hysterical, and there was, one of the byproducts was, like,  this weird paranoia that this dude used to get, and we lived in this apartment in Red  Bank, and he was dating this chick, Stephanie, and one morning I got up, and his room was on  the way to the kitchen, stumbling in the kitchen, and I see Muse laying on the floor outside the 
[03:06:30]  door of his room, and the door is cracked open about an inch, and he's staring into the room,  and I'm, like, what's up, sir?  And he's, like, shh, waving the hand and pointing at the room, and I was, like, what's up?  And he's, like, just shh, and so I look through the room, and I peer through the crack, and  it's, like, his old lady's in bed sleeping, and so I go to the kitchen, he follows me,  I was, like, what's going on?  He's, like, pretty sure somebody's under the bed.  He's, like, what?  I was, like, what are you talking about?  He's, like, I see her lips moving, and I think she's talking to somebody under the bed. 
[03:07:00]  I think she snuck some dude in, and she's trying to fuck him, but it was fucking insane.  Wow.  Yeah, it was weird, because it wasn't cops or anything, like, anyone was after me.  It was always, I was always dating someone.  I was, like, just girl after girl getting high with him, and I, it got really bad to,  the worst thing was, uh, I was living in Huntington Beach with this girl, and I swear it got to  where I'd make her come in the bathroom with me, because if I went to the bathroom, I'd swear  I'd hear her talking to somebody, and I'd run in. 
[03:07:30]  And she'd sit there watching TV, so, what's up?  And I'd be, like, who's in here?  Who are you talking about?  She'd be, like, what are you talking about?  And it got so bad that I swear I thought that I started sleeping with my legs wrapped around  her like this, because I swore that she cut a hole in our mattress, and there was a dude  in there with a hole, and he would play it.  So, I started, I really started going crazy.  Shooting crack is not good.  It'll make you go insane. 
[03:08:00]  A hole in the mattress?  Yeah.  It's a dude with diddle her?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was insane.  And, like, my friend one time came and slept over, a really good friend of mine, and I woke  up, and I, and he was downstairs, and she was right next to me, and I swore, like, that  I heard him running down the stairs, and went down, and, like, started a fight with him,  and was like, get out of my house!  And he's like, dude, what's up?  He's just sitting on the couch, smoking dope, and shit, trying to just mellow out.  A fucking lunatic comes running in. 
[03:08:30]  It was, it was, it got really, yeah, I started, I seriously started going, like, crazy.  A hole in the mattress, sir.  That is.  That takes imagination.  Really?  Like, that is.  I bought, I bought one of those voice-activated recorders and put it under a pillow, so, like,  when I would go to the store and come back, and it got, I swear that I'd play the tape,  and I'd hear her on the tape talking to people.  Like, all crackly made.  And then I'd have one of my friends listen, and they'd be like, dude, we hear nothing  but air.  I want to do this shit sober.  I want one of those things.  You'd hear, like, things, you'd hear things in the hissing. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, like, it just, like, blub, blub.  It's like, what is that movie, White Noise?  I couldn't understand what was going on.  Yeah, yeah, White Noise.  We diddle you through the mattress tonight.  It's a message from space, and it's Hitler.  Here's the, uh, fucking, uh, contact him.  Wow.  Man, no stuff.  That is some paranoia.  I, I've, you know, been through people at my house when we, we used to, uh, me and my  brother used to deal just to support what we were doing.  We never really did a lot. 
[03:09:30]  Coke, you know, uh, we, people would come over, and we'd free base and stuff, and, uh,  uh, sell Coke so we can get some.  You know, you cut it up.  You get some good stuff, you cut it up, sell it, and then snort the good stuff or, or  smoke it.  And, uh, people would come to the house.  It was like three in the morning, and you get a knock on the door, and there was a guy  standing there once with a big water jug from, you know, water cooler full of pennies.  Just going, dude, man, I don't even know how much is in here, but I know it's more than  you, you're asking for. 
[03:10:00]  And, like, didn't you just say that, like, uh, didn't you say 10 minutes ago you were  too scared to do anything, like, go pick up a kilo, but you're selling crack?  I didn't sell crack.  This motherfucker's like, I won't pick up a kilo, but I'll sling rock.  I won't pick it up.  People could die in my house.  No, my, my brother was dealing, and, and, but he was living in the same house, like, I  wouldn't be busted, too.  And we were all doing it.  You know, we were all doing it.  How much did the pennies turn out to be?  It was, I don't know, whatever was in it.  We didn't take it.  As a matter of fact, told the guy, just get the fuck out of here.  You know, bring real money. 
[03:10:30]  That seemed like a pretty sweet deal.  Bring real money.  It might have been more.  It might have been less.  We couldn't do the math.  It's like a jelly bean fucking thing.  How many jelly beans are in here?  It's like Goodwill hunting in that moment.  But the paranoia, the paranoia that you would get, there would be people that would come  over and just constantly opening the curtains and going, dude, what, what is that?  What?  Like the constant paranoia.  And then there was, we used to, like, our freezer was full of those pretzels that you  put in the oven and super-friendly, nice pretzels.  But the salt would get on the floor. 
[03:11:00]  And by the end of the night, like three guys would be crawling around with pretzel salt  in the pipe, just going, no, man, this, I've no, I dropped this before.  And they're fucking smoking pretzel salt.  It smells so bad.  Like anything, anything white or something that they would pick up off the carpet was  something.  And they would rather smoke it and see if it was a freebase or Coke.  So I was doing Coke and I'm sitting at my mother's house and I don't know where she,  I used to sleep on the floor when she let me in.  And I'm fucking so high on crack and Coke and I'm drinking. 
[03:11:30]  And I think I saw a mouse, right?  So I'm like in my underwear and I put plates of peanut butter around the house because I  thought it was a rat.  And I wanted to sit there and I'm sitting there like, oh, fuck, I'm going to catch a rat  in the house.  You know, I'm just, you know, like I got like a fucking hammer in my hand.  Paranoid of rodents.  Rodents.  Well, I thought it was.  Most people it's cops and some people are diddling their girls.  That is the best paranoia story I've ever heard.  That's right up there. 
[03:12:00]  Meanwhile, the plate of peanut butter, you fucking hear something on it, you look over, it's  Kevin Smith.  It's like, free fucking peanut butter?  What are you doing, man?  It's awesome.  Kevin Smith in my house.  But he won't eat it.  He's just like rubbing the hole in his asshole.  Can you look at this?  Hey, we should take a break.  All right.  I mean, thanks for the listen.  That's some unbelievable shit.  Did you ever drug?  I was never drugged.  Not really, man.  And I like weed is the toughest thing I've ever done.  Well, maybe we smoked hash once at Quick Stuff, which is essentially kind of weed. 
[03:12:30]  Hash, yeah.  I never eat extra though, man.  I went through the Coke thing, but nothing too crazy.  I never did that either.  Len Bias, when his heart fucking exploded.  Yeah, that kind of.  I was like, I'll never touch Coke in my life.  I did it for about two, maybe two years.  And then it got to the point where I was like, this is really bad for you.  You know?  And then like years later, like 10 years later, you go into a bar and see somebody that you  used to do Coke with.  And they're there, they're like, hey man, what's up?  You want to fucking go in the bathroom?  And their mouth is like grinding away and their eyes are darting back and forth. 
[03:13:00]  And you're like, dude, what?  You're still fucking doing this?  How are they not gay?  That's insane.  Yeah, how are you not?  I could have done it for 10 more fucking years.  Right.  You're like, why did I quit so early?  I'm such a quitter.  Right.  Yeah, Jesus.  Hey, before we break, I got to, wait, let me know when you, I don't want to interrupt you.  I want to just get out.  No, let's go.  We should take a break.  We got food for you today, Jimmy.  I got to, I just want to give plugs out.  Okay, go ahead.  First is, thanks to the food, is Rivoli's restaurant, our friends in Tom's River. 
[03:13:30]  They always bring fucking great food.  It's an amazing restaurant, too.  From Tom's River?  Yeah.  This guy does it up right.  That's a really good, it's like an hour and a half ride.  He uses his billboard to promote the show.  He's just a great guy, man.  Awesome.  Yeah.  And the birthday cake, of course, why they put, courtesy of CBS Radio, Free FM.  They actually, they're making cakes now?  The male dancers.  I'm sure they made money off the cake.  The male dancers.  Sponsored.  Yeah.  Probably sponsored.  Yeah, at least it sold the fucking cake carrying.  To the same company that made Christopher Reeve's wheelchair.  Oh, they are.  All right.  Camel blowing out is sponsored by. 
[03:14:00]  Male dancers are courtesy of.  Of.  Of.  Dot com.  Centerfoldstrips.com.  So if you're a chick or perhaps homosexual and you'd like some male dancers, they were strapping.  I'm not gay.  But, you know, if there was a man I was going to have, fuck me in the face.  Boy, one of those two fellas would have been the choice.  Centerfoldstrips.com.  And, of course, the OzFest tickets are courtesy of OzFest and Jägermeister, who have been great friends.  To the show, Jägermeister.  Yep.  And the Pioneer Inno radios that have my stupid face on the display in honor of my awful birthday. 
[03:14:30]  Well, they changed the channel today, too, I think.  Did they?  Yeah, it's Jimmy Day.  Okay.  So it's Jimmy Day on there.  It's still a bad vintage.  Is it spelled properly, you fucking illiterate cocksucker?  Yeah, nothing new.  I saw that.  That sign was spelled wrong, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Fimmy.  Fimmy Day.  I didn't get that joke.  I don't know.  It might have been a misspelling last time that he was calling back, but it was too obscure  for anybody to remember.  I didn't really get the joke on that one.  You guys are hanging, right?  Yeah, we're still hanging.  I also want to thank him.  Thank you.  Oh, look at that.  And, of course, Clerks 2 opens Friday.  Is that fucking Elo?  Yeah.  Did Elo have a...  Is that Photoshop?  Yeah, it's got to be. 
[03:15:00]  That's great.  Because his hairline isn't...  That's great.  Look at Elo's the greatest.  That's our boss, head of programming.  He's got a rainbow...  What do you do?  Now, do you take that sign home and put it in your place?  Or what do you do with a big card like that?  Yeah.  What do you do?  It just...  You look at it and throw yourself out of a window.  No, because I have...  I just got a...  You know, a photo of Richard Pryor, a photo of me with Sabbath.  I mean, but I'll take one of them down and hang that.  Yeah, sure you will.  No, no, I won't wind up in a dumpster on fucking 58th Street.  Take it away.  Take it away.  Take it away.  Johnny sent it from L.A. 
[03:15:30]  He fucking...  That'll be in a dumpster and you'll be behind the dumpster.  I want to thank the...  You ain't getting away from that.  That was a big one.  And also, I want to thank the funny farm in Atlanta for having me this weekend, Thursday  through Sunday in Roswell at the funny farm.  I ate enough plugs.  Yeah, really?  We got to...  I know.  I could tune the whole thing.  It's not even the end of the fucking joke.  More fucking plugs than Matthew McConaughey.  Does he really?  That's what I've read.  I love that guy, man.  He just brings it. 
[03:16:00]  That was a pitch perfect delivery because there was a split second where I was like, what?  All right.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Jimmy.  It's your birthday.  We're going to party like it's your birthday.  Open presents like it's your birthday.  And every fucking day is your birthday.  You're climbing at the store buying presents for little Jimmy Gordon.  I'm here every day.  It's birthday.  Come so fucking often.  I want to get a lot of good.  But I'm running out of money. 
[03:16:30]  And I got to buy Steve some motherfucking money.  I got him a wild sconce just the other day.  But Jim North told me that gift is kind of gay.  So I said, fuck it with this one.  I can't go wrong.  I got him a good certificate.  The bad man to be on.  I hope people come to my party.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Jimmy.  It's your birthday.

You know it's your motherfucking birthday every day, all day.  If someone as fancy as Jim Norton cannot even fathom celebrating his birthday one day a year.  It's a monumentous occasion. 
[03:17:30]  The birth of our little Jimmy Norton.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  The O.B. Ancury Show.

[03:28:00]  jay's right here  um i right now  i'm having a really bad problem  with uh roxie's and oxy's  and the doctor i go to  out in kingsburg  and middletown  that's your hometown  and it's getting harder  and harder to cop  and i'm really trying not to  you know go to dope  but  i'm just wondering like  how did you kick  um  i don't mean  it's  i mean i went to rehab  for one to help  withdraw and go through  that whole thing 
[03:28:30]  um  but i don't know  i think i just got to a point  because i mean i went to  rehab like  three four  yeah three four times  um  and i don't think  i sort of went to rehab  for uh  you know the wrong reasons  i had to get sober  to work  and  and do this stuff  i mean i  i wanted to get sober  but not really  but it got to the  the very last time  it just got really bad  and i just  you know  really wanted to stop  and and had it in my head  and and that's it really  you know what  any detox  will take her  for five days  at least  at least you can go 
[03:29:00]  into a detox  for five days  in any hospital  and  and but listen  three three days  four days  the physical  the physical addiction  is gone  i mean  you're you're gonna get rid  of the uh  right isn't it like  well i'll be honest  oxys are a little tougher  i mean because i've kicked  dope and oxys  and it's a little bit  longer  but yeah i mean  you figure a week  is the is the  really hardcore  um withdrawals are over  but uh  i mean yeah  i think you need to go  in somewheres  and in somewheres  they'll give you like 
[03:29:30]  the clodidine  and clodidine  and clodipine  and clodidine  and all that stuff  helps you uh  withdraw a little bit  do you hear about  like doctor suspense  and this like  opiate blocker  type shit  that shit  listen to me  but that won't  help you withdraw  that's just  you know i mean  you're still gonna  get sick  that just  that just keeps you  from if you use  again you won't  get high  you get sick  uh but it won't  help you withdraw  methadone after  did they treat you  with that  no no no  i think methadone  is worse  that gets in your  bones and all that  and i tried that  and you always wind  up meeting uh  some do you 
[03:30:00]  you wind up  i used to just  like even if i  stayed away from  everyone else  and i'd wind up  meeting people  that did drugs  at the methadone  place and it  was just  it was closer  like you start  talking to people  and instead of  going all the way  to norc i met  someone in asbury  you know i mean  so it's just  made it more  convenient  it really did  so i don't think  the methadone  nice networking  you need to just  uh you know  make a decision  that you really  want to stop  and then go  in somewhere  that can uh  give you some  stuff and stick  it through  i'm like a 
[03:30:30]  functioning addict  where i go to  work every day  the only time  i don't go to  work is  when you don't  have it  and you can't  get out of bed  and you're  shitting yourself  oh my god  i mean you guys  were talking  about the  constipation  and stuff  before i was  like i was  laughing i mean  that was a joke  compared to the  shit i go through  we're not going  through apparently  yeah exactly  yeah i mean i  would say that's  your best bet  is to check  into a detox  and see uh  you know see  how that helps  you and then  there's a thing 
[03:31:00]  i haven't done  it i don't know  how good it  works but they  say bufenex  uh it's a like  program where you  go for like four  days and they  give you bufenex  and that's supposed  to be all right  i don't know i  haven't done it  so i know i've  done some research  on the internet  but i don't want  to keep you guys  too long jay  i love you  love you love  you and ob  anthony i've had  xm for like a  year now me and  my daughter are  completely hooked  the water  seems like you're  hooked on just  about everything so

[03:35:00]  feely with me  i didn't want to be  touched by other  men with no shirts  how was the tranny  um convincing at all  yeah uh no uh no  no no no it was  like it was just uh it  was it was more for  the humor value  what was the surprise  he didn't know you  hi daddy  keep that under your  hat would you  as it were  it was weird where  there was no car  window between you  two  yeah usually they're

[03:36:30]  story well getting two  walks during a minor  league baseball game is  usually not a big deal  unless the batter is  someone special and  that's why it's  definitely becomes  one of our morning  moments the batter  buck o'neal he's  one of the greatest  stars of the negro  leagues  o'neal batted lead  off for one team in  the north league  all-star game  he walked  then he was traded  to the other team  and walked in the  bottom of the first  o'neal is now  officially the oldest  player ever to play  pro ball  at 94 years 
[03:37:00]  young  we've had him on  our show  he's a terrific guy  so much personality  i heard him on the  radio on the way in  and he said they  were screaming  buck buck buck  how can you not  like this  they still love the  game  is he black  yeah  and they're yelling  buck  that sounds a little  racist  jesus christ  how uncomfortable  they was yelling  people were like  fuck  fuck  get this 94 year old  off the plate  suck  he sucked  it's all part of  that whole like  you know  young at heart

[03:41:30]  deal with all my feelings  oh i think we trash in  between every line i don't  think so i think we should  just uh let it go it's one  of these rehab things it's  fucking really so  because in rehab you know  it's one of these you know  get to your feelings what  are the roots why are you  what are you burying to get  high all right and and the  first line you're laying in  your bed you're not thinking  that you're thinking about  why you were touched as a  kid and why you're in  princeton house but i didn't  teach you how to deal with  anything i drank in the  rehab hey we we need this  is what we need we need some 
[03:42:00]  uh some sensitive music  sensitive music we need  kevin smith to do the  sensitive reading i've got a  theory that you didn't even  need to go to rehab you just  wanted to go somewhere where  you could write poems  it was your own walden woods  kind of thing  it's spalding norton  what uh what song can we play  in the background for  something like this  no do the uh the music from  uh from uh everybody hurts  well titanic titanic theme  would be nice yeah that's  like touching everybody hurts

[03:43:00]  you can all right  here i lay at princeton house  just staring at the ceiling  between these walls they've  taught me how to deal with  all my feelings  did they  no  i hid my pain down deep  inside i tucked it all  away  the pain it grew it ate at  me  it killed me day by day  i feel like i'm 16  i had a friend he helped me  cope named johnny walker red  if the johnny walker company 
[03:43:30]  is listening right now this is  your campaign i was the  fucking girl fart joke of  fucking alcohol  and then a game walked in with  beautiful stems uh but just  when you think this is noir i  did you see oh i did  question an ad in a magazine  yeah picture jimmy and it  just says i had a friend he 
[03:44:00]  helped me cope named johnny  walker red little picture of  the bottle at the bottom that  was johnny walker black upset  you weren't friends with him  all right i heard inside to  learn the truth he'd rather see  me dead oh johnny turned on  yeah johnny was a ghost kind of  fucking friend is that jack  daniels was another one a so  called friend of mine i'd wrap  my lips around his neck he'd  leave me feeling fine that's a  homo rock jack daniels too had  lied to me i'd been deceived  again so i set out in desperate 
[03:44:30]  hope to find a loyal friend to  press no more my spirit sword i was  no longer sad for i soon met a  southerner by the name of old  granddad  i like how you're just paying  tribute to booze  register rehab we're all running  out and banging dope that night  sir i give it up for your rhyme  scheme  i mean it's not like iambic 
[03:45:00]  benthameter but you've got a  decent rhyme scheme do you know  that i have been fucked i'm less  embarrassed admitting prostitute  golden shower stories i had a  girlfriend piss in a cup and i  drank it one time and this was  sober and i'm less embarrassed  admitting that than hearing this  was the girl's name johnny walker  red  another friend called jose cuervo  tequila it helped to dull the pain  when i thought about my uncle  coming in to feel ya  me you  i had that so worked out in my head 
[03:45:30]  and then when it came out my mouth  i should have wrapped my lips around  a jack daniels ball  he'd let you feel and find till you  realized he wanted you dead  then it really hurts  why didn't i put one of these  he'd lead me to the promised land  the road we'd start to pave but the  only road this bastard knew was a  shortcut to the grave  wow bastard that bastard  this passion i left these friends  not knowing i left these friends  not knowing that my end was  drawing near  quite cheap thought i 
[03:46:00]  to leave the rye the gin and  ever clear  what does that quite cheap mean  i tell you well i actually it's  funny somebody just brought me a  copy of what i wrote on the blog  and i do call myself out on it it's  not a fucking uh  you do you do a line by line  critique  oh great  this is like clips notes right here  yeah i see  wow yeah  this poem this poem was like  two weeks into improv going yeah i  get it  i get what they're doing right you  know what i mean this is like i get 
[03:46:30]  what they're saying to me so you  wrote the poem like yeah oh yeah  yeah yeah  this is like two weeks in probably  this poem is as epic as paradise  lost  well this is not this is the poem  you are milton at age 17  that's the poem plus my critique i  mean i did go over it with a  he went  he went line for line  fine tooth comb and straight  myself right out  dude you've inspired me i'm gonna go  dig out my fucking high school  ramblings  there's something kind of like i  mean nothing as good as this i  assure you  i wish i'd saved some of it  i i i have it all sadly  i wish i think everyone's got a  douche chili  what are we gonna say rich 
[03:47:00]  you had something uh to say  no i said i said this is like two  weeks in a rehab where he goes  i got this stuff this is where the  feelings  everything starts coming out  right  that's why i already said it  why did you make me do it again  no i really didn't hear you  i wasn't setting you up that  time  um  i'd be okay if every day i'd  only  i'd stick to only beer  but i've been tricked and my  disease would look at me  and sneer  did it  did it  but this social drink 
[03:47:30]  in quotes made glamorous by  commercials on tv would take its  toll  i'd sell my soul  it was my  enemy  you're blaming the fucking media  here  you're blaming a commercial  but this  quote-unquote social drink  hey  some people  can just have a fucking beer  well maybe  if you met a southerner  named old granddad  and if you realize where that  bastard wanted to take you  make glamorous by commercials  on tv 
[03:48:00]  man  if you understand  what's important is the rhyme  oh okay  i would have said anything  like any good writer  if i would have thought of it  i would have wrote  now i can't laugh  tee hee hee hee hee  with you  i'm sure you could have  fit in vd  yeah  or hiv  i had any kind of foresight  i knew not  i knew not why  i couldn't find a friend  who'd really help  but then i knew  the time was here  it was time  to help myself  my mind was sick  my body scarred 
[03:48:30]  my life was at its low  but light shined  through the princeton house  like fire  in the snow  oh that's evocative  damn  what's evocative mean  i can see it  fire in the snow  i thought it meant  like what happens  to stomach acids  when you eat  fucking six week old sushi  what a cunt face i am  i'm happy now  my life is good  and hope  is shining in  but the worst part  of this mad disease  is that to surrender 
[03:49:00]  means to win  sir i give it up  17 that's good  it stinks  you're a good man  17 i wrote a poem  at age 16  called the princess  and the clown  you want to talk  about gay  horrible  that at least  there's some depth  to it  and you did keep  the rhyme going  the whole time  yeah that rhyme  i can't  i'm going to take  your breakdown home  yeah i enjoy  the breakdown  and it's  it's a blog  i have not touched  in a long time  it's jimnorton.blogspot.com  the first line 
[03:49:30]  is genius  the first line  of the poem  is here i lay  at princeton house  you're staring  at the ceiling  and you write  i suppose the first  question would have  to be if i am staring  at the ceiling  how am i writing  oh that was delicious  yeah it was alright  person's 35 to 64  my god  alright uh  let's say hi  to richie and queen  your breakdown  is very funny jimmy  thank you  and i also  break down a fucking  uh a letter

[03:50:30]  that's what i had  to follow  i remember the last  time i fucked her  her asshole stanked  that's true  i fucked her  doggy style  and her fucking  ass reeked  hence leading you  to johnny walker  it was a fucking  a trip to the grave  was preferred  to that trip  to the mushroom factory  let's go to  richie in queens  richie  right here right  yeah go  yeah you're on man  yeah i was just curious  i was watching entourage  and they kind of  trashed you twice  i was wondering  if uh 
[03:51:00]  you pissed the writer  off over there  i did  a long time ago  yeah  yeah  wait what happened  because a lot of  people called  about this  they did uh  they did one  took one shot  in season two  during a sundance  episode  and there was a  harvey weinstein  like character  named harvey  weingarten  and uh  ari gold  was like  if it weren't  for me  he'd be stuck  making kevin  smith movies  for the rest  of his life  and then  last  not last week  but the week  before  you know  in the plot  of the show  i guess uh  they want vince  to make uh  aquaman 2  and um 
[03:51:30]  you know  i guess  in the plot  of the show  jim cameron  directed the first  one  and they're saying  since they're  rushing it through  it's gonna be  a different  director  he's like  well who's  the director  and they're like  michael bay  and they're like  well who's  writing it  and they said  kevin smith  and apparently  they said  shit  i haven't watched  the episode  yet  but i am  an entourage  watcher  and um  i gotta believe  i mean  you know  it could be  any number  of things  or maybe  a bunch  of people  on the show  that are  just like  it's an easy  shot  i wrote  superman  blah blah  shit like that  but there was  a dude  on the show  a writer  on the show  named um  what's his  fucking name  i'm sorry 
[03:52:00]  rob weiss  made this movie  back in like  93 called  amongst friends  um  which played  sundance  like the year  before clerks  and a friend  of mine  john pearson  who wrote  this book  spike mike  slackers  and dykes  he's an  indie film  rep  back in the  day  he had  was one of  the producers  on amongst  friends  so when he  wrote his  book which was  about 10 years  of the independent  film scene  the chapter  on weiss  was called  amongst jerks  because apparently  weiss was just  horrendous to the  dude  and one of those  egomaniacs  who'd never done  anything before  and whatnot 
[03:52:30]  and um  believed his own  hype before there  was hype  and blah blah  blah so in the  book um  preceding each  chapter pearson  sat down with me  and we just had  conversations about  any film i was a  brand new to the  scene and whatnot  i'd just done  clerks and i think  at that point i'd  shot mall rats  so um my  experience with weiss  i mean i'd met  him once but he  was dating shannon  doherty and shannon  doherty was of  course in mall  rats and um  god this is a long  story i'm boring  myself  i really am  pretend you're  staring at a 
[03:53:00]  ceiling  let's go back to  reading poem  but he uh he used  to like he was one  of those boyfriends  that like we were  shooting in minnesota  he was back here i  guess or no he was  in los angeles and  um he's from long  island i would think  it was five towns  long island  yeah yeah um and  he would be uh like  calling her you know  and like before she  was about to shoot  and shit and he  just fucked with her  head he's one of  those boyfriends  that like psychologically  fucking torturous and  he would just be like  she's like well i gotta 
[03:53:30]  go shoot and he's  like well if you're  getting off the phone  i'm going to a club  and fuck somebody  oh and then she  would just like get  all upset and fucking  cry and it held up  shooting and i was  like that's horrible  to do period but it's  even worse when you're  a director and you  know what it's like  when you're trying to  keep to a fucking  schedule and then to  fuck with you know  the elite actors in  the picture and  whatnot it is just  bad so in the book i  said like look i you  know pearson's  bagging on amongst  friends i said i  thought the movie was  watchable i said but  this is what that  dude's like blah blah  blah so fucking 11 
[03:54:00]  10 years later he held  that grudge and then  he hasn't worked since  amongst friends like a  series of like you  know failed fucking  flicks that never went  anywhere never got  made or anything like  that right and he got  hired to write on  entourage and and he's  done a like good job  like that's the sundance  episode was was totally  enjoyable i gotta tell you  i love your honesty  because you know it  doesn't help uh that  you're in hollywood and  you're you've always been  honest with the people  and uh what you think of  them it's not an easy  thing to do when you're  this one like really came 
[03:54:30]  back to bite me like 10  years yeah but you do  it all the time is what  i'm saying i respect that  a lot 10 years later  uh let's say hi to  dennis  that's stuck in his  craw it really did and  you know what i at a  certain point i'm like  look i get it i got it  coming to me although i  was just being honest the  dude was a fucking total  douche um but but it's  like i get it you know  now it's payback or  whatever and but at the  same time it's like make  a kevin smith reference two  weeks before clerks come  out please yeah go ahead  on a show that people  watch do it up that's
