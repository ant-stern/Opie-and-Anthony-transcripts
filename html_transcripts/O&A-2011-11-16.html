<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Opie, Jim Norton, and Bob Kelly discussing Kelly's experience with the Medifast diet, including graphic details about its effects on his bowel movements and flatulence.  This segued into a conversation about Kelly's chest pain and his unconventional doctor, "Dr. Steve," with a caller, "Wood Floor Liquor," providing EMT-informed commentary and confirming the name of a prescribed medication, Dexilant. The hosts shared their experiences with various doctors, criticizing a Russian doctor's bedside manner.  A significant portion was dedicated to recounting a recent interview with Chaz Bono, filled with crude jokes about Bono's appearance and relationship.  This was followed by a lengthy debate on the merits of Adam Sandler's filmography, punctuated by insults and disagreements between the hosts and Kelly.  The discussion briefly touched upon other actors like Mike Myers, Kevin James, and Jim Carrey.

The Occupy Wall Street protests and the clearing of Zuccotti Park became a central theme.  The hosts expressed mixed opinions, criticizing the protesters' hygiene and behavior while also questioning the police response, particularly the disposal of protesters' belongings.  A YouTube video from Anonymous declaring war on the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg was also discussed, with varying opinions on the threat's seriousness.  Bob Kelly's new role as a police officer in a TV show was mentioned, sparking jokes about its potential to replace "60 Minutes."  The segment also included the usual "F-U Line" calls, snippets of Snoop Dogg's music, and promotional plugs for Kelly's podcast and stand-up shows.  Graphic descriptions of the unsanitary conditions left behind in Zuccotti Park were shared.

A segment featuring comedian Bob Kelly included a humorous bit with sound effects ("Foley work"), followed by a discussion of Bill Maher's contentious appearance on *The View*, focusing on a joke Maher made about Elizabeth Hasselbeck and the hosts' criticism of Hasselbeck's reaction.  Otto from the comedy duo Otto and George joined the show, and there was promotion for Kelly's internet show, "The Pig Roast," scheduled for November 22nd.  The health of comedian Patrice O'Neal was briefly mentioned, along with various clips from a caller Jay's podcast.

Another segment began with an argument over a hat, quickly evolving into a discussion of a deceased listener, the "Pig Roast" show's commercial load compared to other podcasts, and commentary on Colin Quinn's personality and Twitter.  A phone call with "David from Israel" provided insight into his life, including experiences with missile strikes and bombings, and Israeli-Palestinian relations.  Promotion for Jimmy's "Antisocial Tour" and the show's "Amateur Night Dance Contest" and upcoming live event at the Hard Rock Cafe (featuring a picture of the Iron Sheik with a urine stain and a mashed potato eating contest) were included, alongside promotion for Steven Singer Jewelers and the "Pig Roast."  Details about the "Pig Roast's" production, including challenges faced during filming, were also shared.


The final segment discussed competitive eating, focusing on hot dog eating contests.  A past internâ€™s disastrous chocolate-eating contest was recounted.  Significant time was dedicated to preparations for a live show at the Hard Rock Cafe, featuring a "First Thanksgiving" skit with the O&A staff in various costumes, including Ant and Stalker Patty as Pilgrims, Jim, Bobo, and Voss as Indians, and E-Rock as the turkey.  There was discussion about the script, potential for offensive humor (including Sandusky jokes), and costume reveals, including  a clip from a previous show featuring Chaz Palminteri and Rich Voss.  The show concluded with promotion of the Hard Rock Cafe live show, the "Pig Roast" web series, Trojan condoms, and a listener's job posting for a soft switch engineer.

[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel, XM 105, Sirius 206. 
[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show with O.P.  We're experts, and we're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony... 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  You're dang open-handed.  Don't listen to the dang open-handed.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Uh, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Today we got Jim Norton. 
[00:04:30]  As always.  You got me.  As always.  And today, filling in for Anthony Cumia...  A special treat.  It's Bob Kelly.  Hello.  Which means, uh, today's show is the job show.  Jimmy, Opie, and Bob.  We like to name these offshoot shows.  So today's show is job.  See, I would have went with Pajot.  Pajot.  Pajot.  I, uh, yeah, I saw Anthony's text, but I saw it this morning. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  I texted late last night.  He wasn't a fellow, so I got it today.  You okay?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  A little.  His asshole is sore.  My asshole hurts.  What happened to me when you date those young girls?  They always want to get up in that asshole.  Yeah.  At some point.  Young girls like to get into the asshole.  They just think it's progressive.  That is.  That's not good.  Yeah, they love getting in there.  No.  That's not good.  I know what happens with my asshole.  It gets bad. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, I think as you get older.  I drink a lot of vegetable juices.  Oof.  And I shit red because of the beets.  Oh, right.  Yeah, beets will fucking kill you, man.  And trust me, I had it checked out.  It's just the beets.  But it'll turn your bowl bright red sometimes when it comes out.  It's just the beets.  Wow.  Yeah.  I just envisioned your asshole in a compost pile.  So now you understand.  Fuck that, man.  I think your asshole gets more fucked up.  And plus being heavy, being a fatty, your asshole gets bad too. 
[00:06:00]  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  Why?  Because it's a lot more pushing out?  I don't know.  I think it's just a lot of hot.  It's hotter down there.  It's sweatier, yeah.  Anytime I see a chick with a big ass, that's why I don't like big asses.  Because I know just how hot it must be inside of there.  You know what I mean?  To get to the asshole, the air to get to the asshole is almost impossible.  The last time air got to her asshole was she was taking a poo.  And then it shut and vacuum sealed. 
[00:06:30]  And then she walks all day.  Rubbing the cheeks.  Yeah.  Then sweat just dripping down into the crack.  Yeah, you have to take her pants off.  Mixing with fecal.  Make her squat down in front of an open window.  Just a cool window.  Imagine what would waff in.  Get in front of the fridge and open your asshole up and just cool that off.  I like a little bit of the scent to it.  Not nasty.  No, no, no.  Not hardcore.  Because I've gotten a few that even for me, I was like, oh. 
[00:07:00]  I like a little bit, but nothing.  You know, a little something that smells like a woman.  I like nothing.  If I lick her asshole, I want it to taste like her elbow, her fucking shoulder.  Just something bland.  A piece of calamari.  Anything.  But you lose a few pounds, Bobby.  No.  I lost a little bit, then I gained it.  That Medifast doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  I got to go.  I wonder what dog wants to do that.  It didn't work for you, you got to say. 
[00:07:30]  It doesn't work.  Why doesn't it?  It didn't work for me.  It works.  Let me take that back.  It works.  It works.  I don't think you're taking it seriously.  Absolutely works.  No, I took it seriously.  But for me, it was too gassy.  It made me too gassy and bloated.  Because it's the protein soy.  I don't think I react well to soy.  It definitely worked.  I lost weight on that diet.  You know, you're eating five times a day, those little meals.  And it wasn't that bad.  I mean, I didn't mind the diet.  The concept of it was actually kind of cool after a couple days.  They deliver it to you? 
[00:08:00]  $370, you get a month and a week of food.  And you just eat.  It's good for being on the road.  That's what kills you.  I leave Wednesday.  I come back Monday.  I leave Wednesday.  I come back Monday.  I'm always in the hotel room.  How much of that food is in the garbage as you're ordering room service?  Come on.  Come on.  Let's be honest.  I'll be honest.  For the three weeks, I'm good like that.  Like, I quit smoking.  I'm like, I'm done.  I haven't smoked in almost three months.  But when I decide to do something, I'm good.  When I don't, I'm just terrible.  I go off the rails. 
[00:08:30]  Does the food taste good?  Some of it does.  Most of it does.  Some of it is atrocious.  Yes, that's the problem.  They have cheese puffs.  They're good?  No, they're not good.  They taste like chemical styrofoam balls.  Could you get it delivered on the road?  Well, no.  They deliver it to you, and then you take it with you on the road.  On the road, too.  Like, it's little packages.  It's like shakes, bars, and they have, like, eggs and all kinds of brownies.  How do you make a package of eggs?  It's powder. 
[00:09:00]  You put it in, they give you this little cup.  You put a little water in it.  You throw it in a microwave, and it's eggs.  And they're good eggs.  It's like egg whites.  And it tastes like fucking egg whites.  Really?  But the farts I had on this were so bad, and the gas was so bad, I had to get off of it.  That's just the reason I would take it.  Did it bother the dog?  The dogs, my wife, it was so terrible that my wife was literally like, dude, stop, dude. 
[00:09:30]  Dude, knock it off.  It's not even fucking funny.  And they would, there was no sound to them.  It just.  Just that hot air?  It came.  That.  Yeah.  Those are the worst kind.  Yeah.  I love, I love, you ever, you ever, like, as soon as it goes, you're like, oh, this  is a doozy.  Oh, yeah, this is going to be ugly.  Before you smell it, you know it's going to be ugly.  When you feel the warm air going down your leg, and it's coming out your cuff.  Yeah, and they're so solid.  Two times, I was on stage, and I thought I shit my pants.  I literally backed up against the wall, put one leg up that I thought the shit was going 
[00:10:00]  to dribble down, and wrapped my hoodie around my waist.  As you're doing a set.  I, I, I, I, it was actually, I tweeted that.  It made me a better comic, because I had to just stand there and tell my jokes.  I, I thought I shit my pants.  Guaranteed I shit my pants.  Went back.  No shit.  I think diets suck.  I'm, I'm actually going to the heart doctor today, because I had a fucking pain in my chest.  Oh, that's good, Bobby.  Two days ago.  I think it was an esophage.  I talked to Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Who is fucking amazing. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I mean, amazing.  He's, he's what doctors should be.  He really is.  Yes.  That's why I, I have him as, as a friend and a doctor too, because you can't get your  regular doctor on the phone.  They, they get bothered and they're busy and they never call you back.  And you need kind of a consultant, like a Dr. Steve, that you could call up with all  this nonsense.  But not only is, you can call him, he's so fucking on the money.  Yeah.  Informative.  And you don't have to, it's not like he's, well, did you do this?  You tell him one little thing and he's like, that's probably, and he goes on. 
[00:11:00]  That's probably this.  It could be that.  You should call this.  I'm going to send you something for that.  Well, the other side of that is when he doesn't know, and you could hear him going through,  going through papers and books, and you could hear him typing on a computer as he diagnoses.  Slightly yelling at his wife, give me the fucking paper.  Yeah, exactly.  Over there.  Give me my laptop.  You twat.  So, so what's this pain thing?  I, I was on the phone.  Uh, I was writing, uh, with, uh, Burr and DeRosa and we were, something happened. 
[00:11:30]  We were talking about something and then all of a sudden my chest just tightened up and,  uh, I was like, what the fuck?  And I, you know, I took the hit, you know, you take that first hit and then it went away  and then it came back and I literally go, I gotta go.  And I felt bad because I scared them because I was like, I gotta go, my, my chest.  Jesus.  And, um, my wife comes over.  She's like, she's like, what's wrong?  What can I go?  I go, my chest.  I don't know what it is.  She goes, do you want me to rub your back?  I go, no, I don't want you to fucking rub my back. 
[00:12:00]  Call 911.  Well then, then I think she panicked a little bit and then she's like, do you want me to  call 911?  I was like, no, wait, I'm going to get it checked out today.  It was probably esophagus spasm.  Esophagereal spasms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes you'll have an esophagereal spasm.  It's from a lot of times fluid from drinking too much caffeine or other things like that  will cause a spasm in your esophagus.  Or maybe some acid splashing upwards.  Yellow reflux from the flat.  I'm serious. 
[00:12:30]  We all know this one, Bobby.  Oh, dude.  It's fucking right on.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you'll be fine, but you should definitely go.  Check it out.  It could be something, but it's probably nothing.  He's a ghoul.  He really is.  Dude, that is one of the best fucking impressions I've ever heard.  You haven't heard that yet?  I'm putting that up against anything Jay Moore does.  Dude, that is fucking crazy.  That's fine.  I know I do.  Dr. Steve.  That's my one impression.  You got a numb arm or anything?  No numb arm. 
[00:13:00]  It was...  Nothing in the jaw?  I'm going today.  Nothing in the jaw.  All right.  You're good.  You're probably good then.  I had heart scares too, though.  I went for the test and it's fucking horrifying.  Well, you know, with the last year, you know, with all this crazy shit that's going on with  all of us, it's like anything that happens.  I quit smoking.  I get these pains in my chest and I'm like, I'm flipping out about everything now.  I'm flipping out about...  So I get everything checked out because I don't want...  I don't want that to fucking...  I was having breathing issues and chest pain and so I went to...  I went and did...  Are you getting the... 
[00:13:30]  I fucking panicked.  I went and got the heart, like the...  EKG.  Yeah, but they also do like a dye injection or something.  Like I got like a really good...  You got the whole heart checked out.  A nuclear heart test.  I did the same thing last year.  It's scary when it's your heart, but I found out I'm okay.  I have a teeny leaky valve.  She goes, it's nothing.  Just be careful, you know.  Really?  She goes, it's nothing.  You haven't checked once in a while.  I'm getting that done too and I'm getting a stress test done today where you get on the treadmill.  Yeah, I did that too.  And they hook you all up.  So I'm getting that done at actually 10 this morning.  Worst part of that is you got to like keep your breathing calm so they can check your heart. 
[00:14:00]  It's a nightmare.  What do you mean?  Well, you know, you're breathing heavy because you're on the treadmill.  And I'm fat.  And then they put you back down on the table and they're like, don't breathe, you know,  too heavy because we got to like get an accurate reading here.  It's a pain in the ass.  You have good wind for a big guy though.  Bobby has better cardio than most guys who are, you know, fat as you are.  Yeah, I'm...  I don't mean to say it like that, but I mean, Bobby does have these athletic wings.  I used to be able to run up a canyon, smoke a pack a day and be a fatty.  It's weird.  But I worked out for the first time Saturday and Sunday. 
[00:14:30]  Sorry.  That was a fucking very good one.  Well, you can't pause.  You know the good one.  You can't pause on this.  It takes a...  You freeze everybody.  Well, you can't pause.  So you worked out, what?  I worked out.  I worked out.  I did the Comics Come Home, the Larry thing.  I love that fucking show, by the way.  I haven't done it.  I mean, gone up there in years for it, but I love going up there for that.  It was...  Yeah.  Now it's like 6,000 people.  Really?  Yeah.  6,000 people.  I did it last year.  Why aren't they filming it again? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I'm guessing comedians, it's harder to get comics to do it if you're filming it.  Yeah, it was crazy.  They used to film it years ago.  Who was on it this year?  Artie Lang, Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo fucking killed it.  Crushed?  Yeah.  Nick's funny, man.  It's great.  Nick is...  And then they had Dom Irera.  Oh, good.  Artie Lang.  I did it with Artie like three years ago.  DeRosa came through.  Then they had Tony V.  If you guys don't know who Tony V is, oh my fucking God.  He's a Boston guy, one of those guys like Sweeney and Gavin. 
[00:15:30]  I've heard his name.  Tony V is fucking funny.  I mean, holy shit.  I was watching him like what the fuck?  Have you seen him?  I haven't seen him in 15 years.  Oh, okay.  Since I left.  Fucking hilarious funny.  One of those old school Boston guys.  Kenny Rogerson was on it.  I don't know him either.  I didn't hear his name for years.  Then Burke came in at the end and just jumped on and closed it out.  Really?  Oh, it was so fucking surreal.  I'm sitting next to Cam Neely on the monitor watching Burke crush. 
[00:16:00]  And we're both just fucking laughing.  He's doing that joke about gold digging whores.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a great joke.  And you could just see Neely totally like, I get it.  He does that part where he goes, just a fucking squad of gold digging whores.  He's like Braveheart running over the hill once you make your fucking mirror.  Fucking hilarious.  Burke killed at Carnegie Hall, too.  I haven't seen him on stage in a long time.  Holy shit.  He's got plastic surgery fucking stories that are hilarious.  Not about him.  I mean, his material, you know. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, he's fucking, he's just annihilated.  He's hilarious.  And his dog material.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Why don't you just jump on the mic?  E-Rock, talk into the mic.  He fucking feeds me lines.  I don't need lines fed to me.  Fucking turn on a mic and say what you want.  It's like having a pain in your eardrum.  And all of a sudden you realize, oh, it's just E-Rock.  Piping up.  They're saying it's angina, Bobby.  Angina.  It's a diet thing.  I will guarantee it.  Or like an acid reflux thing.  I have real bad acid reflux and I just switched over to new pills. 
[00:17:00]  What are you taking?  You were taking Nexium.  No, I switched over.  Actually, Dr. Steve gave me a new pill.  The blue one.  Cialis?  That's what he gives me.  There's a blue one for acid reflux.  I was on it for a while.  Yeah.  I am off it.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I was acid refluxing for two straight years.  How'd you stop?  I don't know.  Maybe I'm not stressing as much.  I don't fucking know.  What's the acid reflux pill you're on?  Or we're on.  I forgot the name of it.  I forgot the name of it.  It's a blue pill.  It's way better than that.  Is it better than Nexium?  Yeah, way better. 
[00:17:30]  Way better than all that shit.  It works for me.  I don't have to take a pill.  Wait a minute.  Because fucking Nexium.  Here's the.  What's the side effect?  Because Nexium I take and my stupid provider.  I have to order it now from Medco.  Like, I don't want to fucking order my pills.  So I asked Dr. Steve.  Okay, I have to re-up.  The side effect is you might fall in love, Jimmy.  With what?  With a girl?  I thought of my ex-girlfriend because I was in the fucking Apple store yesterday trying  to get something off the shelf and I couldn't.  I had to ask another man to get it for me.  I'm like, sir, could you reach this?  And she used to always make fun of how short I was. 
[00:18:00]  She used to get stuff off the high shelves for me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would never be able to go out with a girl taller than me.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, she didn't care.  My wife is, it's close, but I'm taller.  But I don't know how you walk around.  I loved it.  With a girl that's taller than you.  Loved it.  I love taller chicks.  Especially in heels.  You can just hug them and you're fucking hugging their ass.  What happened?  You're turning off your own mic.  I didn't hear your hands on your hat.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't know I had buttons to do that. 
[00:18:30]  Bob's little hat was on his little buttons and he put his little hand in his little hat  and he hit his little button underneath his little hat.  You got a lot of power over there, Bob.  Focus.  Focus on what you got in front of you there.  I didn't know that Ann had these buttons over here.  A lot of buttons.  I love my wife being shorter than me.  I like that.  I like that.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you hold your wife in bed or does she hold you?  Oh my God.  What's wrong with you?  You don't hold each other?  No, I hold her.  You hold her, right?  What?  She holds you?  No.  I was talking. 
[00:19:00]  I was fighting with her.  She went to grab me the other night, like wrap around me.  She goes, and I was like, no, I hold you.  I'm the fucking man.  She feels like she has to hold you.  Oh my God.  That's the worst.  I tell you, bald like a big giant baby.  She's like, oh, let me snuggle this.  I tell you.  Look, if every once in a while she wants to hold me, that's fine.  But in general, you should be holding her.  You hold her.  You protect her.  Why was she trying to hold you?  I don't know.  She came around.  Are you crying about something?  No, she came to grab, like she put around me.  Right. 
[00:19:30]  And I was like, no, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I know what that is.  What?  You want me to tell you?  What?  That means she really wants a child.  She wants a child?  She's trying to fuck me in the ass to get it?  She's fucking nurturing you, brother.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wants that child.  Is that weird?  Because I would suck my girlfriend's nipples and she would go like, I would be, eww.  No, that's just because you look like a baby.  You hairless little cutie.  We understood it, Bob.  Woo! 
[00:20:00]  I wanted to add to it.  Jesus, half the phone calls have Dr. Steve as a consultant, too.  Holy fuck.  What?  Wood floor liquor has the acid reflux pill because Dr. Steve gave it to him as well.  What's the pill?  And wood floor liquor lives in Philly and Dr. Steve's in Tennessee.  And you said, by the way, you said it right.  I really, you were right.  He's what a doctor should be.  Absolutely.  As far as the way he talks to you and the way he really cares about, it's corny, but  he really wants to help you out and he really thinks and he listens. 
[00:20:30]  He's great.  I think there's a huge business out there for, I call them consultants.  You know, sometimes-  That's what everybody calls them.  But honestly, a guy that doesn't have office hours where his whole job is to just take  phone calls from paranoid middle-aged guys with all this crap going on.  Oh, yeah.  I think it would be a huge business.  And then you pay him a little consulting fee, you know, for the year to have him on retainer.  On retainer.  I'm not even kidding because you got a dumb little thing.  You try to call your doctor or try to get an appointment.  It's always a nightmare.  Well, they do have that. 
[00:21:00]  They even have a show on USA Network about it.  Do they really?  No.  Absolutely.  What is it called?  I had an original idea for once.  Royal Pains.  Yeah.  This guy who got fired in New York as a doctor went out there and became a consultant doctor  and whatever the fuck they call him.  But this guy, let me ask you, do you pay them probably by credit card?  What's the legality of it?  On the show?  I think it's, they don't pay them.  Meaning you have to know that you're only being, you're paying for an opinion.  Right.  You have to know that you're only getting an opinion.  No, but they actually will come to you.  You can have doctors that will come to you. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Oh, this is, you know, we can't on the phone.  Yeah, but I'm talking about a guy that.  It's called a concierge doctor.  That's what it's called.  Concierge.  Just a guy that could calm you down and go, all right, I think you, I think it's this, but you  should get it checked out type of shit.  And this is the good part about Steve, though.  It's not like he just tells you, this is what you should do and get it checked out.  He goes, here's a guy, here's another guy, and you should go to this website.  He gives you all the extra information.  Like, he texted me shit yesterday after the phone call.  Like, he was still thinking about it. 
[00:22:00]  He enjoys sending reading material.  Does he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can read up on it if you like.  Wait, here's a reader with those eyes.  Here's Wood Floor Liquor.  Go ahead, Wood Floor Liquor.  Good morning, boys.  I just wanted you to look.  No, you're not behind the eight ball.  I mean, I'm an EMT.  I have some medical knowledge.  My wife's a nurse, and we call Dr. Steve for problems, too.  But the pill that he gave you guys is probably Dexalant, because he gave me the same thing.  What's it called?  Dexalant.  Okay.  Is it blue?  It's a blue and green capsule.  Did he give you, like, samples, like five in a bottle? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  With the little white thing in the bottle, too, so the pills, it's hard to get them out?  Oh, that big, that white cylinder thing?  Yeah, that white cylinder.  And it's not even cotton anymore?  Yeah.  You've got to work the pills around this dumb thing?  Don't forget it.  If one of them gets wet, it sticks to it, and you're going to fucking bite through that  plastic container to get your last pill.  At three in the morning, you get your heartburn pill because you're dying?  Because you feel like you're having a heart attack?  Yeah, I've been there.  Wait, what?  Is it better than Nexium?  It's supposed to be a combination of, like, Prilosec and Zantac. 
[00:23:00]  It's an extended release, and it works a whole lot quicker than either of those two do.  And I can answer Jimmy's question.  I mean, it depends.  I mean, some, you know, these pills work better for some.  I think so.  I think so.  You have to try shit out until the one works for you.  What's the side effects?  Because doesn't Nexium do something to your bones?  Doesn't it weaken your bones or some shit?  This is old man talk, by the way, for anyone who's under the age of 40, but does shit.  The side effects, it'll give you a chin.  No, I don't want it.  If I had a chin, my whole act would get out of the toilet.  Well, you know what it does is your neck will recede, and the Adam's apple portrays a little 
[00:23:30]  morgue.  It gives you illusion of a chin.  Wood floor licker.  What?  Yes, sir.  What's up, buddy?  What's up?  Do you like licking pussy?  Well, when you lick your wife's vagina, the asshole comes up into your nose and affects your  nose and the savolophagus fucking patterns.  You got to be careful, because a lot of times, a little sweat builds up and you have a fluid,  a little leakage, which will drip down into your mouth and make your throat sore. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, do you know what those chest pains might be that I had the other day?  It's probably, it could be a muscle pull, or it could be esophageal reflux disease, which  is caused by your gastric reflux.  I think that's what it is.  It's a gas thing.  I would bet money on it.  It could be a heart, but it's probably not.  Or you're about to have a massive coronary.  Yeah.  I don't think so, because, you know, here's the deal.  I went, I go, ever since I got insurance, like five years ago through SAG, because I'm 
[00:24:30]  an actor.  I have it through AFTRIC, because I do it with radio.  Oh.  And TV.  Oh.  I go every year and get a physical full fucking, from that lady near you.  Yeah.  She's okay.  I don't know if I'm going to use her anymore.  Oh, the Russian?  I had a bail on her.  You did, right?  Yeah, I don't like her.  What happened?  She's sexy as all hell, and she'll fucking examine you like it's a fucking movie where the blouse  buttons are undone just enough where you're looking at bras and stuff, and I didn't mind  that part of it, but she's a fucking robot.  She really is, but she's Russian. 
[00:25:00]  The Russians, their idea of compassion is not just smothering you with a pillow.  She's not at all good.  Yeah, but she's kind of voodoo, too.  She has all these alternative things that she tries to sell you after.  Her bedside manner sucks.  Stinks.  It stinks.  Because she's Russian.  Yep.  And you go, I don't know, this looks a little funny.  What does that mean?  It could be cancer.  What?  Really?  I mean, I'm exaggerating, but it's like that.  He knows.  Yeah, she's like that.  She exaggerates instead of just going, no, it's probably nothing, but let's get it checked  out.  She's like all about, no, it could very well be this. 
[00:25:30]  She's the Club Soda Kenny of doctors.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You might have something wrong with you.  It could be cancer, hopefully.  That was Jewish kind of Club Soda Russian Kenny.  I had a bail on her.  I'll tell you what I think it is.  I don't think it's Russian as it is.  She's trying to upsell you.  She's trying to get you to do an extra.  All those tests, all the things she extra she gets you to do.  Right.  She gets more money out of you.  Right.  So it might be cancer. 
[00:26:00]  We need to do three more tests.  Right.  Because I went in for a physical.  All of a sudden, I'm doing all these other tests.  Then she wants me to buy.  I was perfect a year ago.  Heart, EKG, everything.  No diabetes, no anything.  Blood work done, no cancer.  Right.  But she still had, she goes, your vitamin C or calcium or something.  Here's these pills, and I want you to put you on this test.  I want you to come back in four months.  She freaked me out, too.  That's exactly what I'm talking about. 
[00:26:30]  But it was for more tests.  The more tests.  Yeah, but it's how.  Dentists do that, too.  Hold on, Bobby.  But that's how she, it's the way she says it.  Where now in your head, you're like, fuck, what the fuck is this about?  But does she do it, or does she send you to people?  Because a lot of times, they'll just recommend you to somebody.  But she gets, she.  We don't like her.  We don't like her.  When you forward somebody, when you forward, I'm talking email talk.  When you, as a doctor, recommend somebody to a specialist, does a specialist get,  do they get a piece of them sending to a specialist?  Like a finder's thing?  A referral thing or some shit?  Do they?  I don't know.  I don't know if doctors do.  I don't know, but I think they, I think that they do work together. 
[00:27:00]  Because you go to this one, she'll send you to that guy, he'll send you to this guy.  And they're all pals, and they all fucking make money off your insurance.  And not that doctors make a shitload of money anymore because of insurance.  Nobody's paying cash anymore.  You know, like a golden nougat.  Well.  He fixes, you know.  But it's like recommending your friends.  Yeah.  You're fine, Bobby.  I think, I changed doctors too.  Dr. Steve hooked me up with this new guy that I'm going to.  I think I know who you mean.  I'll ask you off air, but I think there's one he was telling me about too, 
[00:27:30]  that I kind of want to have a regular, because I'm in Manhattan,  so I want to have a regular doctor at a regular hospital.  Why doesn't he just move up to New York and start a business?  Yeah, we're really tired of you in Tennessee.  Why don't you stop?  Just move up here.  Tennessee stinks.  Between the people on the show and obviously the listeners,  you'll have a booming business.  Yes.  Of needy creeps bothering you for free.  And then you can do your dumb radio show live in the studio.  Yeah, his radio show's great too, though.  I listen to that fucking thing, and you're like, oh my God.  That show should absolutely be syndicated across America, but, you know, whatever. 
[00:28:00]  It's a really good show.  It's so unique that radio would pick up a show like that in a second.  How often does he do it?  And this company, if they would wake the fuck up,  they should, you know, make it more of a regular show.  Yeah, it's like fucking, you know, they really don't know.  It's a really good show.  It's a really good show.  It's like the You Know What Dude podcast.  Why isn't that on this fucking channel?  I would have to agree with you.  Actually, you know what?  Did it get back to you?  We want to play the Bailey episode on here.  Yeah, if you play all the other ones every once a week. 
[00:28:30]  Atta boy, Bob.  We got to go into this slowly.  Slowly?  Give us the Bailey.  You know any downloads I got off of that fucking thing?  So send it over here now.  I'll fucking send it over here.  We'll see what else.  Let's do it.  Because we talked about the Bailey episode so much,  now we want to hear the whole thing in its entirety.  I'm fine lover.  I'm friends with her now.  We're going to have her over for dinner.  Yeah, she's very cool, and I've texted with her a little bit.  She has chit-chat.  I want to do her podcast when I'm up in...  She's like her husband, too.  He's a nice dude.  We had Chaz Bono in yesterday. 
[00:29:00]  Chaz.  That's a different answer.  Chaz was great.  Fucking great, man.  She was great.  How could anybody think we should have beat Chaz up?  It's like Chaz was open, told the truth, didn't dodge questions,  was talking about all this private shit,  and people are like, yeah, you should do it.  Shut up.  For what?  Did you make any jokes, though?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, but I asked...  Does she have a vagina?  Yeah.  I asked her about that.  She talked about it.  Hey, him.  I can't say him yet.  I can't say him yet.  Did they put cotton in it?  Did she make it like a little change purse? 
[00:29:30]  That's funny.  No.  One of those two little snaps on it?  But I asked her.  She's a hysterectomy.  She's still using it, man.  No, she still gets...  It's a she still.  I mean, she's on her way.  The beard looks good.  The voice is definitely deeper than Sam's.  All right.  But when she smiles, she's all woman.  She looks like an ONA listener.  Yeah.  I think she looks like a guy, man.  Chaz looks like a guy.  We know Chaz Didi Bono.  When you just take a picture of her, she looks like a guy.  But when you kind of study her and look at her and watch her, 
[00:30:00]  there's still a lot of woman in there.  You'll have a little bit...  The smile is...  The smile is a dead giveaway.  Because Chaz Didi had such a recognizable smile.  Sharon Sonny's kid had a very Chaz Didi Bono smile.  But that's just a famous trait.  She's absolutely passable now as a man.  She's on her way.  And she's got the facial hair.  That comes in through the drugs, correct?  And the mannerisms.  But she said she can't grow a mustache yet.  Yeah.  I can't either, though.  You can't?  No, not a good one.  I grow a terrible... 
[00:30:30]  No.  Really?  A little wispy-haired one.  Could you just let everything grow for a while?  I have at times.  I would love to see what that looks like.  You should let that beard grow.  I'll tell you why I don't.  Because occasionally...  For me, we'd have to go more than a month.  And I usually wind up doing something...  Like shooting one thing.  And I can't do it for that.  I'm babbling.  Just try.  Until you have to shave.  Yeah.  Just try.  I think it would be hilarious.  I would love to.  Please do.  I'd love to see little patches that don't connect.  Yeah.  I want to just get a mustache.  Because Ted Sheckler has a mustache. 
[00:31:00]  Ted.  Jesus.  We had a good interview with Chaz.  We had fun with her.  We definitely got a little silly.  But, you know...  Now, her girl, though.  There was no reason to beat her up.  No way.  In the old days, we just beat the shit out of people for the hell of it.  But now we're in a place in our careers...  It hurts us to just do that.  But if someone deserves it, of course we'll rip their fucking head off.  Right, yeah.  And that's exactly where we are today.  Sorry.  If she had an attitude or something like Paris Hilton or a bunch of people in the past,  then sure we would have attacked. 
[00:31:30]  But these guys just want us to attack everybody.  That's not the show anymore.  But it doesn't make sense to do it.  And just as many people would be mad if we did, if not more, because it would have been phony.  It would have been like, why are you attacking this person who's telling the truth, who's being open, who's not high?  It's like there was no reason to fuck with Chaz Bono.  Chaz was nice.  And in the end, the positive feedback outweighed any of that nonsense that some of the guys were trying to start.  I didn't listen to you, but you guys are funny.  They weren't funny?  I thought so.  There you go.  You made some jokes about her fucking, her big, huge nipples. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I tweeted that she's not going to be a woman until she calls another woman.  You know, I mean, wow, I just fucked up this whole fuck.  She's not going to be a guy until she calls a woman a cunt?  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's hilarious.  That's really funny.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, but it's not funny on the radio.  It was funny in a tweet form.  You know, you didn't say it.  Holy shit.  You know, I wouldn't be a man until you had two genders and you said the wrong one.  I know.  I know why?  Because you confused the fuck out of me.  I'm still saying she.  You said he's not going to be a she's a Klingon, but he panicked. 
[00:32:30]  I totally fucking panicked.  Wheels came off.  Fuck!  The wheels just came off on that one.  He did panic.  I can't even find the tweet now.  That was funny.  I saw it in his eyes that he panicked, though.  Oh, my God.  As soon as he said a woman, he goes, that's wrong.  Fucking nonsense.  Where's the fucking tweet?  The gender person won't be gender person until then.  I wrote, I don't think Chaz Bono will truly be considered a man until she calls a deserving  woman a cunt.  I wrote that and she needs to get that cock made.  It's funny and true. 
[00:33:00]  Wait a minute.  But she was explaining with the hormones that her clit could get up to three inches.  And it starts to look like a mini cock.  And I think that's what she's going to do.  She doesn't want to add anything on to that because that's where it scares the fuck out  of her that they're going to fuck it up.  Oh, God.  Supposedly, they could get this up to three.  I think up to three or four inches, right?  Yeah.  But I wonder if there's any surgery involved in that, too.  A clit?  Huh?  A four-inch clit?  Bodybuilders have big clits because they take testosterone.  Not four inches. 
[00:33:30]  Why don't you guys enjoy that for a little while?  Because I don't get that one.  What, big clit?  Or a four-inch clit?  I don't get the four-inch clit.  I don't, I'm sorry.  Four-inch clit, I don't like it.  It's way too big for me.  I like a thick clit and big pussy lips.  But I don't like it to look like a dick.  I really don't.  Like, I've seen clits and I'm like, nah, it's just too big.  It looks like a small dick.  You like it.  Dick's looking like dicks.  That a boy, Bob.  100%.  If you're going to go dick, go dick.  Go cock for Pete's sake.  Right.  But I like a big clit.  Why are you fooling around with the dumb clit?  I don't like it to me, too, man.  It's like steak-flavored fucking salmon.  I don't like it.  But you know what?  In the end, it was all right. 
[00:34:00]  Chaz will absolutely be back.  She seems very happy with what she's doing.  Now, her girlfriend, though, is she here?  No.  Jen.  I mean, not for nothing.  She's fucking nuts, man.  Well, she's really confused.  But Chaz said that she's bisexual.  Because she got into a lesbian relationship, but now she's with a guy, technically.  It's just weird when you're...  But Chaz said she's bisexual, the friend.  And that's how, the girlfriend, that's how...  The other thing about Chaz...  It's like fucking E-Rock.  The other thing about Chaz that slightly bothers me, she's dressing like what she thinks a man dresses like. 
[00:34:30]  She doesn't really understand yet.  You know what I mean?  It's all about suits and dress shirts when she's out and about.  She doesn't really understand what a guy wears yet.  But if you became a chick, you'd wear what you think...  We would all have miniskirts on.  Right.  Like, we would all have the sluttiest outfits of what we think a woman would wear.  And with her, it's as guy as she can get.  Like, she's at some kind of red carpet event in this picture we're seeing, and she's got  a business suit on, because that's what she thinks guys wear. 
[00:35:00]  When, you know, she's a celebrity as well, and it would probably be more of a casual thing  she wears on the red carpet.  But you know what's weird, though, is that if, okay, like, Bailey J or her, if they got  arrested, if they committed a murder or something, what the fuck?  There's a special place in jail.  What do they do?  Special place in jail.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they have holding cells where you're, I think if you go to prison, it's different,  but they do segregate you, just so the other guys don't rape you, or there's not, it's  just a weird, I don't know where they put you, but I know that they do isolate you. 
[00:35:30]  I've seen enough of the lockups, how, like, all the trannies in one area, right?  Or they put them with other low-risk, or low-risk offenders, I think.  Would you call that area heaven?  Yeah, they put you in this little special place, which you have to, if you behave well,  you get there.  They call it Jimsy's cell, cell block Jimsy's.  Yeah, they call it, like, tranny cell or something.  Oh, boy.  It's just obvious.  I hate Chip.  You're not gonna do well with Chip today.  I hate Chip.  Between me and Bobby, you're gonna have a tough time with Chip, I'm telling you right  now.  You'll have a good time with Chip.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah?  Bobby's not gonna give you a shit on this.  Yeah, Bobby's gonna give you a shit on this.  Yeah, Bobby's gonna give you a shit on this.  Are you eating a yogurt or something?  He's just gonna say fucking Chip over and over again.  I fucking hate him.  My wife did a Chip there.  She texted me a Chip.  Fucking.  Oh, please tell me what she said.  I'm ruining Bob's marriage.  Chip is ruining Bob's marriage.  Fucking hate him.  They're not gonna get divorced.  It's not gonna be an argument over money.  It's not gonna be about infidelity.  It's not gonna be about anything but Chip.  That's what's gonna finally ruin that marriage.  She fucking, she, she makes me sick.  Yeah.  She has good taste. 
[00:36:30]  Well, let's stop that conversation.  I know.  What happened?  It's awkward now.  Bob's looking for a text.  You do know that Chaz has a deeper voice than you, right?  I don't know.  I mean, it's not.  It's time to admit some things.  I can't say it's not dissimilar.  I even told Troy to, like, give us a comparison.  Is he ready with that?  I know he's doing a production piece, but.  He's very slow with that.  I said I was going to Best Buy on 23rd.  She goes, are you buying the best? 
[00:37:00]  I almost fucking.  She rules.  I almost hucked my phone in her face when I went back to the house.  Tiss, tiss.  She wrote Tiss.  She just had to write Tiss, Tiss.  It's so great.  Fuck her.  Trust me.  It's T-S-S-T-S-S.  Yeah, but you can put a T at the end, too.  Like, Tiss, Tiss.  Either one of them works.  And I block chips.  You block chips?  Oh, my numbers would be fucking huge if I didn't block chips.  Really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I can't.  I think I've blocked at least 200 chips.  There's a fucking stupid diner on the way back to Boston that says chips. 
[00:37:30]  What's that?  Diners?  Every time I see the word chips and potato chips, I fucking think of this stupid chip.  It makes me so fucking annoyed.  I did it to myself over the weekend.  I was watching that fucking Jets-Pets fucking debacle.  First half was good, though, Bobby.  First half was good.  First half was good, yeah.  And then Nick Folk, he missed literally, this is how he said it in the tweet, he missed a chip shot. 
[00:38:00]  My fucking Twitter exploded.  You got chip bombed?  And then I fucking want to punch myself in the face.  I'm like, you did it to yourself, you asshole.  You chip bombed yourself.  But in football, that's what you call it.  It's such a short field goal, you call it a chip shot.  My Twitter, and I'm trying to fight him off.  I'm like, you know what?  You deserve this today, you asshole.  You can't fight a chip bomb.  No, especially if you did it to yourself.  You can't fight a chip bomb.  By the way, for those people, I didn't block any of you. 
[00:38:30]  I deserve that one.  If I deserve it, it's a different fucking world.  Well, that fucking Rex Ryan bugs me.  His face just follows me about.  His fake teeth and his fucking stupid lips.  His wife's feet.  I love his wife's feet.  You know, there's a couple things with Rex Ryan we didn't talk about on the air, but he's leaving.  And, you know, somebody yelled at him, and he told the fan to go fuck himself, basically.  Yeah.  League wants to fine him for that.  That's bullshit.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Let that shit happen.  Yeah.  Someone got it on their cell phone camera. 
[00:39:00]  You got that clip?  Where was he going?  Leaving the game on Sunday.  Were they yelling at him?  Was it anything?  I forgot exactly.  Something like, uh, shit.  I didn't realize we were going to talk about this today.  I don't know.  He was making fun of him for losing the game.  And Rex Ryan was in no mood, so he pretty much, you know, told the fan to go fuck yourself.  Which happens every football game.  I'm sure.  Every fucking game.  Here it is.  Oh, yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  Thank you.  So the, everyone's walking off the field. 
[00:39:30]  Guy doesn't know how to make a video, by the way.  Takes forever for the punchline.  Hey, Rex.  Belichick.  Shut the fuck up.  One thing I say to him?  I don't know.  Something about Belichick.  Oh, Belichick owned you or something like that?  Yeah, he pretty much said, you know, Belichick's better than you.  And the league.  Fuck the league.  They want to bother a guy.  That's what it is.  Can't say that to the fans. 
[00:40:00]  Fuck the guy with the camera, too.  What a piece of shit.  Nah.  He's just uploading it.  He's just uploading it.  Who cares about that part of it?  I would upload it if Rex Ryan said fuck you to me.  Yeah.  I bet you Rex doesn't even give a fuck.  Where are we at with the league?  The league moving on from this?  Yeah, I haven't heard anything yet.  Oh, that's good.  All right.  Good enough.  I was worried that there was...  Was the guy with the camera a fucking press guy or a civilian?  No, he's just a fan.  Just a fan.  All right.  If it was one of those press guys, it's like, dude, you should know better than a fucking  fan.  Possibly even a Jets fan just being an asshole.  All right.  If it's a civilian, fine. 
[00:40:30]  But if it was a press guy...  Oh, no.  It wasn't a press guy.  To get fucking...  You know, I hate that bullshit.  Nah, nah.  That's a cell phone fucking guy.  Just a guy with a cell phone.  The other thing that bothers me about Rex Ryan, he's going to be in a new movie where he's  like a fan of the Patriots.  In an Adam Sandler movie they're filming.  That's kind of funny, though.  Yeah, it's cool.  That's funny.  It's weird.  That's funny.  I love Adam Sandler.  I can't get into a fucking Adam Sandler movie.  You love Adam Sandler?  Did you just say you love Adam Sandler?  I love Adam Sandler.  Yep.  I'll stick up for him, and I'll stick up for Sly Stallone as one of the best actors of 
[00:41:00]  our generation.  I don't mind Sly Stallone, but Adam Sandler, it's a little rough these days.  Sly's choices have been weird.  Are you going to go see Jack and Jill?  I'm going to go see it.  You fucking call after you see that dumb movie.  I'm going to see it.  That movie looks horrendous.  I know, but are you in an Adam Sandler movie coming up?  Huh?  Are you doing an Adam Sandler movie?  What do you mean?  Are you doing one?  What are you mad at?  Did you get a part in one?  Why are you saying it like you're mad at me?  I'm not at all mad at you.  Shit.  Did you?  No.  You did, didn't you? 
[00:41:30]  No, I didn't.  No.  But you guys are talking?  Huh?  There's no way you like Adam Sandler unless he's going to do something for your career.  I can't believe it.  There's no way.  I swear to God.  If Adam Sandler called any of us, we'd do the same thing.  Something's going on with you, Bobby.  There's something about Adam Sandler movies, how stupid and dumb they are, that I like.  That he just doesn't give a fuck.  I like the way he takes care of it.  No, he does give a fuck, but this is the best he can do.  I like the way he takes care of all his friends.  He puts the same people in his fucking movie.  He makes sure his friends have a fucking career.  As a guy, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I love that.  And his movies are fucking dumb and stupid and they all make $100,000.  A hundred million dummies.  A hundred thousand dollars.  A hundred thousand.  A movie you and I did with me.  That was a joke.  Oh, sorry.  Fucking wow.  Am I that dumb that you guys said?  No, it sounded like it was.  I'll tell you.  And yes.  No, I'll tell you why.  What the fuck?  You guys didn't even think for a second.  Bobby, I'll tell you why I, in my opinion, it didn't work.  Why?  Because these movies are so shitty and they make so much fucking money.  That's what I don't get.  Because it's, I don't know. 
[00:42:30]  It doesn't match up the box office numbers and the quality of the fucking film.  That's what confuses the fuck out of me.  This is going to be stupid.  I get it.  But I'm still going to go and see it because I like what Adam Sandler represents.  Name five Adam Sandler movies you liked.  So we can be fair.  I liked the hockey one.  I liked Happy Gilmore.  I liked, what's the one where he, the, the, he, I liked Happy Gilmore. 
[00:43:00]  The one with, where he was a millionaire.  He's a millionaire in every movie.  Billy Madison or Mr. Deeds?  Mr. Deeds.  Billy Madison and Mr. Deeds was fuck.  Mr. Snickers, Snickers.  Come on.  You don't like fucking Billy Mads?  I mean, Mr. Deeds.  I liked Mr. Deeds.  Come on, we give hugs here.  What about the fucking, he does stupid, he does Hallmark cards that stink.  Yeah.  Dude, it's fucking funny.  The butler says I'm very sneaky.  Yeah.  I'm very sneaky.  Sneaky, sneaky.  You certainly got the phone.  Stab my foot.  Go ahead, stab. 
[00:43:30]  I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding you.  It's fucking good.  You certainly got the phones lit on this top.  Beats up the guy in the restaurant.  Yeah, the fucking opera singer.  Oh, they fucking punch him in the face.  Mr. Deeds is a funny movie.  Dude, and I like, I like, I like Mr. Deeds.  I like those three, definitely.  Wait a minute, uh, Fifty First Dates was a fucking endearing movie.  That's a sweet movie.  What's the punch drunk love?  Dude, hold on, excuse me.  That was a, that was a, that was a sweet, that was an endearing movie?  Go fuck yourselves.  Both of you with that description.  That movie?  That was a sweet movie.  I'm not saying it wasn't, but both of you, go fuck yourselves.  It wasn't a sweet movie.  It was a dumb movie. 
[00:44:00]  The description stunk.  That's sweet, and that's Aunt Sam and Aunt Bob chat.  I hear Punch Drunk Love is a good movie, though.  I think that's a new show.  Serious.  Aunt Sam and Aunt Bob chat.  That was a darling film.  I adored it, too.  This is good when they're calling him, they keep calling him gay boy, and he kicks out  a glass door, a sliding glass door, because he's pissed.  When he goes in, he screams at the guy, but then he screams louder.  Yeah.  What's his name?  What's the, I know, this is, you know, I know nothing about, I have no film references  at all.  All right, let's take off Fifty First Dates, then.  That doesn't count, because.  Fifty First Dates was great. 
[00:44:30]  Well, Jim's right, though.  The descriptions we just gave were horrible.  They should both be executed.  So there's four.  Who wants to see a movie that's sweet?  Zohan, I liked.  I thought that was fizzy, fizzy.  I kind of liked Zohan.  I liked Zohan.  I kind of liked Zohan.  I love Zohan.  I love Zohan when he's fucking, when he's with the old ladies and he's fucking banging  the old ladies in the back room, just for shits and giggles.  I think maybe I like every third movie he does.  I, I, I'm a fan of fucking Adam Sandler.  I like Big Daddy.  And I, Big Daddy I liked.  That's fine.  What about the, where was he, the devil?  Little Nicky. 
[00:45:00]  Hated that.  Oh, and Waterboy.  Hated that.  Waterboy hated it.  Waterboy was the fucking funniest movie ever.  Waterboy hated it.  You hated Waterboy?  Yes, Gatorade.  Mama said, Mama said.  Waterboy's good.  What makes an alligator so angry?  Mama said.  Mama said.  Fuck you.  That's a funny movie.  Waterboy's a funny movie.  Funny people.  Funny people, this guy says is great.  I liked funny people too.  No, no.  Funny people was sad.  Here's the other problem with Adam Sandler movies. 
[00:45:30]  They, he needs a good editor.  His movies go on for fucking ever.  Funny people, if it, if they took 20 to 30 minutes out of that movie, it would have been  a good movie.  That wasn't, there was way, that movie was way too fucking long.  That wasn't one of Adam Sandler's productions though.  That was an Apatow movie.  That wasn't Happy Gilmore.  That wasn't Happy Gilmore productions.  That was an Apatow movie.  Yeah, but Just Go With It was very long too.  Just Go With It, I thought again, was good.  You know, he's doing a lot of movies with now is Nick, uh, Nick Schwartzman.  Nick Schwartzman.  He loves Nick, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because Nick's a fucking fantastic writer and actor. 
[00:46:00]  Nick is a funny guy, man.  He's a, he's definitely a funny guy.  I'm glad to see that nobody wants to put me in a movie.  I don't really blame him.  I, I, I would love to put you in something.  Thank you.  Kevin Smith does.  Kevin Smith rules.  I would love to put you in a movie.  Kevin Smith loves old Jimmy Norris.  Kevin Smith.  Loves him.  Well, all right.  I, I, I, Adam Sandler's hilarious.  Fuck everybody.  And he's, you gotta respect what he does.  In this business, most guys would just go and be a fucking bazillionaire by themselves.  He gave all the cast members a fucking Maserati. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I do like him.  Fuck you.  As a guy, he seems cool, man.  That's crazy cool.  I've never seen his movies.  That's because he feels guilty.  No, he doesn't.  He's fucking, he's a nice guy.  They didn't give Colin one, but he's a nice guy.  He knows what I was saying.  He gave everybody a Maserati except for Quinn.  Oh, that family movie?  What was the family movie?  Grown Ups.  That was not a good movie.  Grown Ups sucked.  I'll tell you why that was a good movie.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Because most of that cast had fucking hair weaves on.  And that's just funny to watch.  Yeah.  David Spade.  Oh, they all have fucking.  David Spade at the water park. 
[00:47:00]  What's the other guy?  They pretty much stapled his hair on to make sure it wasn't going to fall off.  Does he have a weave?  David Spade?  I don't know.  I heard many years ago that he is fucking as bald as Bobby is right now.  Bedtime stories, big flop, not good.  Bedtime stories.  Bedtime stories.  You know, what's the remote control?  Remote control.  Oh, Click.  Click was good, too.  It's Christopher Walken.  Click could have been good, and then he has to make it all fucking serious.  All these movies are almost good.  I'll give him that.  Jess always forgets that Click is sad at the end, so she watches it thinking it's a feel-good movie. 
[00:47:30]  She has the DVD.  She puts it in, ready for a feel-good movie, and then she starts crying because she forgets it gets sad.  I love the concept of Click.  You got this fucking remote, and you can do all sorts of crazy shit with it.  I love the concept.  And then he went fucking dark and serious on us.  You gotta mix it up.  You gotta mix it up.  What about Pronouncing Chuck and Larry?  Oh, God, I hated that movie.  That was fucking funny.  No, that one wasn't funny.  Come on.  I mean, look, it wasn't his funniest, but it was, I get it.  He was making a statement.  He has more bad movies than good movies. 
[00:48:00]  That's what I'm trying to say.  No way.  I don't know.  Absolute fucking movie.  Oh, my God.  Waterboy was hilarious.  Happy Gilmore was hilarious.  That fucking Chuck movie, they play that on TV all the fucking time.  That's embarrassingly bad.  Yeah.  He was good in Airheads.  Airheads!  I loved Airheads.  That wasn't his movie.  I know.  Look, then you get something like The Wedding Singer.  I can't argue about The Wedding Singer.  The Wedding Singer was great.  Oh, my God.  I like The Wedding Singer.  But he's, that's fucking hilarious.  He's made some of the funniest movies of all time. 
[00:48:30]  Give me his list of movies.  We're going to do this really fucking fast.  Okay.  These are just going to be.  Let me get a good category and a bad category together.  All right.  We're going to, I mean, he's done.  I'm not going to list every single movie he's ever been in, but Airheads, that's his first  major role, I think.  Bad.  I would disagree.  Billy Madison.  Great.  Good.  Happy Gilmore.  Good.  Great.  Oh, Bulletproof.  Bad.  That was bad.  Fuck, whoa.  Good.  Bad.  That was bad.  Good.  I say good. 
[00:49:00]  This is my list.  Wedding Singer.  Good.  Great.  Waterboy.  Great.  Bad.  Oh, no, that's wrong.  Fuck you, dude.  I will not let you put bad.  Three and three.  No, fuck you.  That's a bad list.  I'm being honest right now.  Big Daddy.  All right, good.  Great movie.  Good.  Good.  Little Nicky.  Hated.  I would say bad.  I would say bad.  I would say good movie.  So it's 50-50 right now.  Good to bad movie.  Punch Drunk Love.  In all fairness, I did not see that movie.  Roland loves that movie.  A lot of people love that movie.  It's a good movie, but maybe you don't put it on the list because you haven't seen it. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  That's good enough.  Mr. Deeds.  Which is funny.  Horrible.  Oh, this counts.  It's a cartoon, but it counts.  Eight Crazy Nights.  Fucking horrible.  Okay.  How about the Longest Yard remake?  Yeah, that would be on here.  Great.  Great movie.  Horrible.  Anger management.  Horrible.  Great movie.  You suck.  Seven to four.  You have no funny bone in you, Scrooge.  What the fuck?  51st Dates.  Horrible.  This is like having my grandfather do this.  Spanglish.  And he's dead.  Horrible. 
[00:50:00]  Look, we're on a roll with bad right now.  First of all, happy Gilmore.  Nine bad, four good.  Slash golf movie.  It was.  It was hockey.  So don't fucking say it's just golf on Twitter.  The Longest Yard remake.  Great.  I think that was good.  That was good.  Sorry.  That was good.  Nope.  Stone Cold Steve Austin dropped the N-word in that movie.  I got ten bad movies, four good so far.  Click.  Fucking hated it.  Just because of the sad part?  Yes.  They blew a good concept.  Rain over me.  That was a fucking serious movie, too, about 9-11 and all that crap. 
[00:50:30]  Hated it.  Uh, I now pronounce you, Chuck and Larry.  Fucking hated it.  Okay, I'll give you that one.  Zohan.  Great.  You know what?  I kind of like Zohan.  Put it in the good column.  You are an asshole.  I got 13 bad, five good.  Bedtime stories.  And this is being reasonable.  Yeah, but your list doesn't make sense.  Fucking hated bedtime stories.  Did you see it?  No.  Okay.  You had a fucked up childhood.  That's why I didn't like it.  My childhood was, you know, 50-50.  It was terrible.  It was 50-50.  Funny People.  Nobody in this room had a good childhood.  Funny People.  Funny People was good and it gets better the more you watch it. 
[00:51:00]  The problem I had with Funny People.  Is that they didn't use one stand-up comic.  And that's true.  I wouldn't see it.  I just wouldn't.  Aziz would have it.  I have to go with bed.  Oh.  It was way too fucking long.  How's this?  They wouldn't use one new stand-up comic?  It's all the same fucking guys in every movie.  Is that, am I out of my mind?  No.  Is it the same five guys in every comedy?  Well, that's the Judd Apatow thing.  He's the guy who likes to reuse his guys.  Which I know that I'm complaining about something that I compliment Adam on, but I'm just saying  I would love to fucking be in a movie with my friend Jimmy.  Some of these movies, in all fairness, are borderline bad. 
[00:51:30]  Like, Funny People, borderline bad.  My problem was bad.  Put it in the middle of the movie.  You should have a middle.  The problem was the movie was way too long, man.  Have a mediocre.  Have a mediocre list.  No, I go bad and good.  Grown-ups.  Bullshit.  Fucking hated it.  That was horrible, Grown-ups.  That was really bad.  Colin Quinn was in that, though.  He did well.  I swear to you.  I swear to you.  It's easy to, like, you know, call me out on this.  I liked Colin in the movie.  Yeah.  I really did.  Really?  Yes.  I did, too.  I thought he did great.  But the movie itself was just horrible. 
[00:52:00]  Just go with it.  That is borderline, borderline good.  Why don't you give it to him?  Give it to him.  I'm going to slide it in the good category to make up for the funny people in the bad category.  This list, did you put Waterboy in the bad category?  Brooklyn Decker was nice to look at in that movie.  I really liked it.  And then Jennifer Aniston fucking stripping down her bikini.  That was all right, too.  And then the last one, which, I mean, you haven't seen, but you can judge, I think.  Horrible Jack and Jill. 
[00:52:30]  Jack and Jill.  I'm not even going to fucking front with that.  All right.  On my list, five, ten, fifteen, sixteen bad movies, six good ones.  And that's what I said.  Every third movie's good.  Some of that was unfair.  Yeah, some of that was unfair.  I don't think so.  Not all of it, but some of it.  And you know what?  All you need is one good movie in Hollywood to have a career.  And Adam has at least eight good movies.  So he's made...  So say this.  I'll cut it in half.  Seven good movies.  Hold on.  All right.  You know what?  Just for the hell of it, I'll slide two movies over to the good category. 
[00:53:00]  Okay, go ahead.  Slide them over.  No, I'm just sliding two.  So now what does he have?  So then I'm up to eight good movies.  That's fair.  Eight great comedy movies.  Fourteen bad ones.  Eight great comedy movies.  Fourteen is a lot.  That's pretty fucking good.  No one gets the chance to make 14 bad movies in Hollywood.  Although a lot of the...  If they make money, sure.  Yeah, because they make money.  They're not bombs, though.  If you were going over box office things, I guarantee you'd probably have 19 and one.  Half the fucking movies I put in the bad category did amazing numbers at the box office.  I love Adam Sandler movies. 
[00:53:30]  I can watch them because they're dumb and it's not trying to fucking make a stupid statement.  It's just a baseball getting thrown in a fucking southern fat guy's face.  Fucking hilarious.  I would see it.  I don't know why I've never watched his movies.  It isn't because I'm like, fuck Adam Sandler.  I just have never seen one.  And I guess I don't watch that many movies.  How long?  But you've got to consider how long has he had a career in this business, which is fucking amazing.  And he's been making his movies under his own banner and giving his pals fucking jobs, 
[00:54:00]  which is great.  This guy, Mike Wendt, on Twitter.  Where'd he go?  The last five to six...  Something is going on, I'm telling you.  I like Mike.  The last five to six Sandler movies could have used an hour chopped out of them.  I'm telling you, that's one of his biggest fucking problems.  These movies go on forever.  Grown-ups went on forever.  Mike is actually a DJ in Boston on the old BCN.  Who?  Mike Wendt.  He's a good guy.  Is he really?  Yeah, he was a DJ...  Mike W-E-N-T.  He had his own show.  Mike Wendt on Twitter.  His own show.  Yeah, well, I think he's making a good point.  For some reason, these movies are a little long. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't disagree with that, but I'll still fucking watch them, man.  I think that hurts them.  I think Funny People, if you chopped out a chunk of time, I think that movie would have  done all right.  In my book.  I mean, who am I?  It did fine out there in Hollywood.  Is there a combination of how much money Adam Sandler's movies have made?  Yeah, it's well over a billion.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Easily over a billion.  What did his last movie make?  That's what you need to find out.  Jack and Jill started at $26 million for the weekend, which again, for a comedy that got  zero stars, it's not a fucking bad start. 
[00:55:00]  That's a hit.  Let me tell you, you make $26 million now?  Opening weekend, yeah.  Now, in this economy, that's a hit.  It's going to be a horrible drop-off.  It won't be his biggest movie, but I think he'll make it my back.  Jack and Jill's getting beat up by a lot of fucking people.  I bet that Jack and Jill winds up being funnier than you think it's going to be.  I'd love to go see it.  You go see it.  And then we come back with our review.  We should have an open mind and at least see the fucking thing.  Okay.  I do see most of these movies.  Most of them.  Out of the whole list, I think I've only missed three or four of those. 
[00:55:30]  I mean, Just Go With It made $103 million.  Jesus.  $103 million.  Grown Ups made $162 million.  That's just insane.  That movie wasn't that good.  What's the one that made Spanglish that only made $42 million?  Dude, everything he's doing.  Spanglish was great.  Deuce Bigelow didn't do great, but did he produce that or was he in it?  He produced it and he had a small cameo, but that wasn't.  Jack and Jill so far, $26 million.  Zookeeper, $80 million.  So Just Go With It, $103 million.  Grown Ups, $162 million. 
[00:56:00]  Funny People, $51 million.  Didn't do as well.  That's Apatow.  Apatow.  Bedtime Stories, $110 million.  Zohan, $100 million.  Deuce Bigelow actually did a sequel.  It did so good.  It was popular in like a culty way that it has Deuce Bigelow.  That's the sequel.  Jack and Jill.  Sequel didn't do good?  No, $22 million.  Jack and Jill.  Where's Jack and Jill?  The first one.  Deuce Bigelow, the first one was funny.  I'm sorry.  Chuck and Larry, $120 million.  Rain Over Me, $19 million.  That didn't do well.  Click, $137 million.  Longest Yard, $158 million. 
[00:56:30]  Spanglish didn't do well.  $42 million.  Spanglish was a fucking great movie.  I'm only saying financially it didn't do as well.  Bobby, really good movie.  Walk of Shame Band says it all on Twitter.  Thank God you aren't trying to get in a Sandler movie.  He's talking to me and can speak the truth.  You're trying to get in a movie.  First of all, that's where you are in your career.  Did Little Nicky Let me make $39 million?  That was one of his bigger films.  No, it wasn't.  Where am I?  Where am I?  Oh, wow.  I didn't realize that.  You're starting to get roles in Hollywood, so you've got to play it differently.  I get it.  No.  I get it.  There's no way this is the real Bobby. 
[00:57:00]  I got it.  But his...  I see you.  What the fuck are you talking about?  There's no way this is even going to get me near Sandler.  But you're hoping.  No.  It's not even going to...  You're hoping?  You think this is going to help anything?  It's not.  I don't believe this is you.  First of all, it'd have to be on a show that people listen to.  Ooh.  Ouch.  I'm sorry.  Nothing.  No, no.  Wow.  That's when you decide to get fucking real.  Well, what the fuck?  Now I'm real?  I was just goofing with you, but that fucking was a shot of reality.  I apologize. 
[00:57:30]  1,998,466,000.  He's made almost $2 billion lifetime gross.  This weekend, it'll be $2 billion.  Two fucking billion dollars in comedy.  Jesus fuck.  He is a fucking machine.  And I don't get it.  I'll never be in one of his movies.  He's a fucking machine.  Don't say that.  You will be if you take acting classes.  And kiss his ass like you're doing, right, Bobby?  And the chin comes in?  No, I don't want the new...  I don't want to be chin, Jimmy.  Dude, you'll be in an ad assembler.  Every time he has a flop... 
[00:58:00]  I can't even get on the radio.  I can't even say it.  Every time he has a flop, his next movie passes $100 million.  He's never been on the show?  No.  No.  Really?  We've talked to him more in the past.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we did.  You see, he's a really...  I met him in L.A. one time.  We talked to him.  At the improv.  Fucking...  Hey, man, how you doing?  I enjoyed you on that show.  That was after Torgasm.  Yeah.  He was like, I enjoyed you on that show.  I was like, really?  He was like, yeah.  Then I was like, oh, thanks, man.  He was like the sweetest guy ever.  I hear he's great.  I've never met him.  Sweetest guy.  Whatever movie came out in 95, 96, those years, we were talking to him still. 
[00:58:30]  That's a long fucking time.  That was Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore Time.  Wow.  I'm trying to remember what movie he was promoting, but we had him on a couple times.  What was his number one hit?  It had to be what?  Big Daddy?  Grown Ups?  Big Daddy.  Grown Ups.  Or Big Daddy?  No, I didn't think...  That's also Kevin James' or Grown Ups.  Big Daddy, but Grown Ups is only a million bucks behind it.  Big Daddy was 163 million.  I don't get Kevin James either.  Sorry.  I got Kevin...  I never got Kevin James.  I get him on the show he was on, King of Queens. 
[00:59:00]  He was fucking hilarious.  You mean the new Honeymooners?  It was terrific, yeah.  Well, I mean, Jesus Christ, everything's the new Honeymooners when you put a fat guy with a chick.  They were more new Honeymooners than anyone else.  Right.  Everyone has been taking for the Honeymooners ever since, but I never got Kevin James.  I hear he's a great guy and a nice guy.  Yeah, I don't...  Do you heard that?  Kevin?  Yeah, he's great.  You know him?  Yeah.  Oh.  I just heard that.  I never heard that he was a nice guy or a bad guy.  Oh, yeah.  He's been very...  Why the shock in your face? 
[00:59:30]  Well, because I just...  You've heard differently?  No.  Now I'm trying to get into a film.  Hey, did I dream this, or did someone tweet me that you had a walk-on role, like, this week on a show or something?  I don't know.  I've done a lot of acting in the last show.  What were you on, like, in the last day or two on TV?  Maybe something you filmed already.  Obviously, you filmed already.  Was it Curb?  No.  No, I saw you on Curb.  It was terrific.  Lawn owner, maybe?  Something old? 
[01:00:00]  Fuck, maybe it was a weird dream I had about you.  I don't know.  I thought I read it to you.  The show you're on.  What, the tutu?  No, supposedly you had a walk-on, and I don't think you had a line.  Is that possible?  Holy fuck, I think I was dreaming this shit.  I don't know.  Now I'm not sure if it was a dream.  Nah, I never do a walk-on without a line, because you don't get paid.  You have to save at least a couple lines to get money.  I'm going to never do anything without fucking getting paid.  The Horse AMF writes, you're being pretentious, too cool for the room with this list, Opie. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Who is that?  That's fine.  Guy on Twitter?  That's where I'm at.  I'm not trying to be too cool.  Mr. Deves was good.  This is so funny.  This guy wrote, and I agree, every Sandler movie always has some sweet moment that makes  me happy and wish I had a better childhood.  It's true.  I'm a sap, though.  I could cry at a fucking Sandler film.  I get teary-eyed at shit like that.  I like just edgier stuff, edgier comedies. 
[01:01:00]  I like edgy comedy, too.  I love fucking stupid, goofy comedy that you don't need to fucking guess.  You like goofy.  If you like goofy, you're in the right place, I guess.  I like it all.  I like whipped it, whip it, whatever the fuck alternative movie that is with that chick  who's 80, but she plays fucking 13 in every film.  Who?  I don't know.  Whatever that broad is.  Who?  Helen Mirren?  The chicken whip it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, that little girl.  Yeah, that girl.  No, it's the Juno girl. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, Juno.  She's fucking like 38, but she plays fucking 12 in every movie.  People want to ask us about Mike Myers.  What happened to him?  That's a rough one.  What was that movie that he came in to play?  The Love Guru?  He needed us so bad that he had all these demands.  We had to set up a green room with all sorts of shit.  Really?  When he came in?  Oh my God, yeah.  What was the demands?  We needed...  Do you remember?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We needed a fresh fruit platter, or like maybe two of them.  Several packs of Twizzlers. 
[01:02:00]  I think...  He had a whole list of things.  And none of it was touched.  Eight or ten Cokes.  That's coming from, by the way, his dumb management who likes to come in and have what they want  to have.  That ain't him.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He might think, hey, can we get some fruit?  But those riders are just in place and they won't bend.  I mean, he was beyond nice.  He was a nice guy.  He was a really nice guy.  Well, you have those...  Sometimes I have a rider for colleges.  And it's a deli platter, Gatorade, and fruit.  A shitty deli platter. 
[01:02:30]  I've been backstage for your shows.  I don't want that shit.  Yeah, I don't want that shit, but they still get it.  Yeah.  I still get it.  You used to have horrible deli platters, too, Jim.  I might have a little something.  Like, I'll have a six-pack of beer in case someone's back there that wants a beer.  Really?  Because if you have a guest come in or the other comedian or whatever, yeah.  He wants to loosen up some of the lead.  Yeah.  Hey, madam.  Hey, madam.  Would you like a fucking beer?  Thanks to the case of beer.  I knocked down a six-pack of beer.  Why do you have any beer you don't drink?  None of your friends drink.  He's trying to loosen up the ladies.  Nobody you know drinks.  That's not true.  So if I'm working with a guy, I'm telling you, it was a case of beer and a whole bunch 
[01:03:00]  of shit.  I knocked it down for like a $50 rider.  There's nothing.  Mike Myers has done less movies, but he's made more money than Adam Sandler.  What?  Fuck you.  He's at $2.2 billion.  Yeah, he had an amazing run, but that last movie, The Love Guru.  Oh, Shrek puts him up there, too.  Yeah, because Shrek did...  It was one of the worst comedies ever made.  Shrek did $267 million.  Shrek 2 did $441 million.  Yeah, he had a great role.  Isn't that more Eddie Murphy, too? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, Myers.  You gotta know it's a Shrek.  Eddie Myers.  Mike Myers does.  Who's it?  Eddie Murphy.  He has the donkey.  Okay.  Between the two, they carry the movie, obviously.  But I mean, Austin Powers also did...  Right.  Three of them, right?  Yeah.  The second Austin Powers did $200 million.  And the Austin Powers movies were great.  They were great.  The third one did $213 million.  The third one was all right.  Not as good as the first two, but still all right.  I've seen Glorious Bastards listed.  Is he a producer on that?  No, he's in it.  He's in it.  He's just in it.  One of the Nazis, guys.  No, he doesn't play a Nazi. 
[01:04:00]  He plays an English fucking corporal or something.  You can't count that as one of his movies, though, because that's a Tarantino.  Right.  He plays a Brad Pitt film.  That's not a Mike Myers movie.  You have the Mike Myers list?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but when Mike Myers came in, he looked at all this stuff.  He goes, what's all this?  Yeah, of course.  I said, and you're right.  That's what everybody demanded.  He goes, I just want water.  Yeah.  And he just grabbed the water and said, you can have whatever you want.  And he was great.  He was nice and all.  He was open.  Yeah, it just says people demanded all this stuff, and he had no clue what... 
[01:04:30]  They never do, right?  It's always the people around him that are annoying.  The movie was just horrendous.  You didn't like Love Guru, right?  Me?  No.  And where are you at with Adam Sandler movies in general?  I love him.  All of them?  Yeah, he's the sweetest guy, too.  Fucking great movies, right?  And he's like the nicest guy.  Nice guy, good movies.  Why wouldn't you support him?  I'll put up with a fucking stinker every once in a while.  He's not nice enough to do our show.  And Barrymore?  At the end, yeah.  She beats the shit out of...  What's his name?  I'd be the worst movie reviewer. 
[01:05:00]  I should do...  You're the worst person.  What's the guy's name with the movie?  The name it is.  The guy, the girl, Drew...  What's his name?  Barrymore.  Barrymore.  And she beats up the guy...  With the pirate guy.  Stephen Hawking?  Oh.  No.  Willie Stargell?  No, who's in the movie, The 51st Dates?  Nothing on a pirate guy?  Who's in the movie with him?  He plays the Hawaiian buddy.  There's all the kids.  He's the Deuce Bigelow guy.  You're doing a Herman Schneider?  He's doing a Herman Cain right now.  What's that?  You're doing a Herman Cain. 
[01:05:30]  What's Herman Cain?  He's pausing to gather his thoughts.  He's pausing and trying to get his answers through another person.  I love Rain Over Me, too.  You did?  What is that?  Rain Over Me.  I never saw it.  What is that?  Very dark.  Cheadle and Sandler.  Really?  I didn't see that.  Yeah.  Is it a comedy or drama?  Don Cheadle's in that.  Yeah.  It's a big time duo.  He's a husband who lost his wife in 9-11.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  I remember hearing...  I didn't know Cheadle and Sandler did a movie.  Sandler is a fucking great actor.  I like the fact that he does that...  Like, he tried Spanglish, which didn't really seem to work, but I like the fact that he does 
[01:06:00]  stuff like that.  Like, he could just do nothing but...  Punch drunk love.  But he tries his other shit, which I like.  He's a really good actor.  Like, regular actor.  We get it.  You're going to be in an Adam Sandler movie.  I'm not.  We can move on.  Mike Myers did Ridiculous because his first movie, like, Billy Madison made 30, 40 million  bucks.  Ooh!  Wayne's World, his first movie made 120 million dollars.  Hubba!  Hubba!  In 1992.  When?  1992.  Oh, boy! 
[01:06:30]  I remember at the time I liked the movie.  I don't know if it holds up.  Some of these movies you see in...  I like Wayne's World to this day.  Really?  You do, right?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  I don't know who that is, but I like it.  And between the instant feedback, the Twitter, and the phones, it's all over the place.  People agree with me.  People agree with Bobby.  I would say it's almost...  I think you might have an edge, Bobby, on this one.  It's a real hodgepodge.  You have an edge, but there's definitely...  I would say it's like 40-60, giving you the edge on the Adam Sandler argument here. 
[01:07:00]  What about Jim Carrey?  I know he's an artist now.  He's a cunt.  Jim Carrey?  Really?  No, just with his movies.  I don't even know the guy.  Stop making these stupid fucking...  Just make a comedy.  Well, he tried.  He did Mr. Palmer's Penguins.  That didn't work out so well for him.  Oh, right.  Well, he's an artist now.  He's doing...  That's what I'm saying.  He has all these strange...  Just make a fucking basic comedy.  Can I just stop you?  I hate when these guys do this.  Bill Murray did that for a while.  Have you ever been to Jim Carrey's website? 
[01:07:30]  It's the most...  It's pretty cool.  Magical, amazing, holy shit website I've ever been to in my life.  Is it expensive, you think?  Yes.  It's got to be a million dollars.  Yes.  His website is...  It's one of the best websites out there.  Holy shit.  This is what it is.  That's the front page.  But no, but this goes into a website, into another website, into...  You just keep going into these fucking...  That's what I want.  No, you don't.  You can't afford it.  You can't afford that.  You have to sell your apartment. 
[01:08:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Look, the thing is floating.  Look it.  Watch.  Now it's an eye.  That's another page.  What does the eye do?  Look it in the eye.  Where do you click in the eye, Bobby?  I don't want to touch the eye.  We don't want to touch the eye.  No one's touching eyes.  Touch stuff in the eye.  But what happens if you touch stuff in the eye?  If you don't move that mouse out, I'll bite your elbow.  What happens now?  I already clicked it.  Look at this website.  Now we're in the clouds.  What's in the clouds?  Oh, my God.  And the way for him to come up, he jumps up, and if you click on him, it shows you pictures.  He jumps up with a camera, takes a picture...  His Twitter. 
[01:08:30]  If you can click it when he jumps up, then you'll get to see his pictures.  How many hours have you spent on this website?  You can spend days on his website.  Dude, it's just like eat a bullet.  No, it isn't.  You eat a...  But eat a bullet's actually pretty good.  Remember Voss's old website with the bobbling Voss heads?  That was terrible.  Really?  I never saw that one.  That was awful.  All you heard in your head was...  Yeah.  Her, her.  But that's confusing, though.  Where do you click if you want just basic Jim Carrey's? 
[01:09:00]  Right there at the bottom.  Biography, TV, casting.  No, but I don't think that shit was up when we first started, was it?  Yeah, it was up.  It comes up.  Oh, my ears itch.  Oh, let me get him scratch.  That means we've been on the air too long.  Is that what that means?  Yeah.  Oh.  We should take a break.  Really?  Why not?  All right.  It's a good start.  What are you promoting, Bobby?  You got the podcast, which is doing very well.  Yeah.  Well, you know what I need people to do is go to iTunes all at the same time at 12 o'clock  today and all subscribe and leave a review. 
[01:09:30]  That's how you get.  I figured out you don't get in the top 10 on iTunes podcasts by being popular or having  a lot of that by people subscribing that day.  Weird.  And leaving a review.  Right.  For that single day.  And then it gets all wiped away the next day.  How many downloads you get per week?  Last week was around 25,000.  Jesus.  And that's not even including like people.  Fuck this place.  Let's fucking move on.  People took the podcast and put it on their own sites.  Right. 
[01:10:00]  So I got like, you know, one guy has like three, 400 hits on that.  The video actually did 5,000 with Jimmy and Bailey J.  Did 5,000 hits.  Which was, it was actually a funny video.  We want to play that episode on here.  Absolutely.  I'll hook it up.  I'm serious.  The whole episode because we discussed it.  We should have Bailey on too.  Yeah, we will.  We should have come back and she's very funny and not like, oh, she's funny for a trend.  You know what?  She's just a funny person.  I know podcasts are working because I see a lot of comedy shows and a lot of you guys  are now mentioned in the podcast and the audiences go absolutely berserk. 
[01:10:30]  I was doing a show.  They go fucking nuts.  And I've seen certain comics, their numbers go up because of the podcast.  I'll tell you this, that I'm getting more people around the world knowing who I am,  finally, like in Australia, UK, a lot of fans of the podcast and then fans of my comedy.  So it's going the other way now.  Right.  So.  And you're making a few shekels.  You know what's weird?  I put a donate button on there because I do it for free anyways, but it costs me money  because I'm always upgrading and shit. 
[01:11:00]  And I just, I literally just upgraded.  I spent a lot of money on design work for my new logo and the new site on gloryholeradio.com.  But I get donations from the fans.  They, they, they fucking love giving you a, you know, donations, a few shekels, 25, 50  bucks.  Yeah.  Like 20 bucks.  It's covering your cost.  Did you see my new photo?  Oh, that's funny.  Holy shit.  That's how you're going to look in 20 years.  I look like a Dutch candy man. 
[01:11:30]  It's a picture of Bobby with a horrendous blonde mustache.  It's like Wilfred Brimley.  Is it blonde or gray?  It's blonde.  Yeah.  From my angle, it looks blonde.  It's a blonde mustache.  You know what's hard about podcasts?  It seems like a lot of guys are doing them now and, and what, it's your outside stuff  that makes your podcast bigger for now.  Like you look at Rogan, his is massive, but UFC is what makes Rogan massive.  And then his podcast, then, then they become their own animal.  But no, no, no, no.  Rogan had a podcast.  He did, but it's bigger because he's Rogan.  It's bigger now, but his podcast was very popular and he's been ahead of the curve for 
[01:12:00]  a while.  He had video back then.  And, you know, I've always, I've done a podcast for eight years.  I did a podcast before Marin, but I did it on my iPhone.  Right.  You know, I did, I used to do it on my iPhone back in the day, like in the car, I'd fucking  do it with, you know, people.  But, you know, Rogan, you know, his podcast, he's been ahead of the curve with Ustream and  video and live podcasting.  It was fucking great.  Like Ant's, Ant's fucking, fucking crazy TV studio. 
[01:12:30]  Have you been to his house in like the last, like that fucking system is awesome.  I haven't been there in a while.  Oh my God.  It's crazy.  You know, and you know, videos too.  The videos are fucking, you know, there's, it's, there's options finally.  Thank God.  Yeah.  How do they get to your podcast as we go to break there, Bobby?  Go to gloryholeradio.com and click Robert Kelly.  You know what, dude?  You're forgetting something.  Yes, sir.  This Friday, Saturday, I'm in Harrisburg at the Comedy Zone.  Harrisburg.  Where is that?  Central Pennsylvania.  It's a good game.  Is it really?  That's great.  Yeah.  And don't forget Borgata, January 15th, 14th is sold out. 
[01:13:00]  But myself, Artie Lang, David Tell, and Doug Stanhope.  I'm assuming there's tickets.  I don't know.  I haven't talked to my agent.  You know what I just found out is that New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve, I don't really  work on New Year's Eve.  I usually take it off.  Do you really?  It's the biggest money night of the year.  I know, but it's, it's, I'm usually away at family because I do the Aruba two weeks  before Christmas and then I go home to Boston.  But this New Year's Eve, I'm doing the, I'm doing two big shows.  Stress Factory, New Year's Eve.  I just booked it.  Right.  So it's going to be the first time I work in New Year's Eve. 
[01:13:30]  That's great.  It's New Jersey, which I'm excited about.  And then, that's going to be fantastic.  Very good.  More with Bob Kelly.  Wait, what's your second major show?  Oh, Boston, Wilbur Theater, the week after New Year's.  Wilbur Theater.  Boston.  And all this is on your Twitter.  New Jersey.  You're confusing the fuck out of everyone.  We don't get too many things.  You can't confuse these people.  They can pick up New Year's Eve and the week after.  These guys are very intelligent people.  Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll put one on the phone.  They're going to think you're in Harrisburg and that he's doing Wilbur Theater. 
[01:14:00]  Can we do that after?  I'm telling you.  Give him, like, eight minutes and see what happens.  But at least, you know, but you go to.  No, we should test one of these callers.  I'm telling you.  Where, wait a minute, the name of my web, where my podcast is, where Jimmy's playing, and where  my two dates are.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Let's just see.  Sir, have you been listening?  Yes, I sure have.  All right.  Uh, where is Bobby going to be New Year's Eve?  Uh, Stress Factory.  Okay.  Bing.  Good.  At gloryholeradio.com.  Where am I going to be this weekend? 
[01:14:30]  Harrisburg, Central PA.  Bing.  Where am I going to be the week after Stress Factory?  I don't know.  I didn't catch that one, Bobby.  Fuck.  That's still a lot, though.  That's when I said, that's when, by the way, when I said, you gotta, you gotta stop.  You're confusing everybody.  I pulled the cord out, but Jim, Jim helped me out with that one, so we sort of pushed  it through.  But I, I, I think they'll get it.  But you see?  Yeah.  That was the one that blew up, uh, most of the people's brains.  They were with you guys until then.  That's what I said.  Wait a minute.  So what happens is, all right, gloryholeradio.com.  All right, Harrisburg, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets, Pets,  Stretch Factory, oh, fuck, I lost it all. 
[01:15:00]  I think it was, I lost it all.  I think it was the fourth plug that got in.  I don't know.  I don't know what the hell to, ah.  But the beauty of Twitter, I mean, if, if these guys are following you, you know, they  get all the dates, too, as they come up, so.  More with Bob Kelly.  Stay there.  You're listening to the, you're listening to the, the Opie and Anthony channel.  On SiriusXM.  Coming up on an all new O and A, Behind the Laughter, comedian Jim Norton opens up about his  private life.  Some of my stomach, and, uh, I guess maybe a little goes in, and it's really hurting. 
[01:15:30]  I'm like, yeah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And the work that goes into creating a great joke.  And I just have to keep, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, just relax, you're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  How does a famous comedian hone his craft?  She's getting annoyed at me.  She's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax.  And then a little bit of a go, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, I have this shit, I have this shit, I have this shit.  Jim Norton opens his heart.  I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit.  And his sphincter. 
[01:16:00]  And then she stopped and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  And we all know, farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like.  Hysterical laughter and soiled bedsheets.  I kept saying, how much is in?  She's like, not much.  When we go behind the laughter with comedian Jim Norton.  And then she's getting annoyed at me.  What the fuck is when we go hasn't been done?  But I have a good boy's phone.  And his naughty boy's phone.  I love he buys phone.  And then he's a good boy's phone.  I love he buys phone. 
[01:16:30]  And his naughty boy's phone.  I love he buys phone.  And then he's a good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone and it's a naughty boy's phone 
[01:17:00]  It's a good boy's phone and it's a naughty boy's phone  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F-U line  Here's the latest batch of F-Ears

[01:20:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One, two, three, and to the four.  Snoop Doggy Doggy.  Oh, fuck.  Let's just sit back and listen to this.  Are you serious?  No, no, no.  Cause you know we're about to rip shit up.  Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble.  Compton and Long Beach together.  Now you know you in trouble. 
[01:20:30]  Ain't nothing but a G thing.  Baby.  Too low-deaf.  Make us so we're crazy.  Death Row is the label that pays that.  Unfadeable.  So please don't try to face it.  Fuckin' Snoop is the definition of cool.  That was effortless when I came out, remember?  Great fun.  Fuck!  Opie and Anthony, it's out today.  Bob Kelly sitting in doing a good job.  Where are we at with Occupy Wall Street?  Big day yesterday. 
[01:21:00]  They cleared out Zuccotti Park.  And after a day of, I don't know, back and forth,  they are allowing them to go back into Zuccotti Park.  I guess, what, late yesterday afternoon, early evening?  And they're allowed back in without their tents  and without their sleeping bags.  Basically without things they would need  to just hang out in the park.  Someone tweeted me and said that,  actually they tweeted me an article saying  there were 14 people in Zuccotti Park this morning. 
[01:21:30]  Just wandering around going, fuck, now what?  What do you think of the whole movement there, Bobby?  You know, I get it at first week.  Now it's like, just fuckin' stop it.  What are you doing?  What are they doing?  I want it to become something.  I really do.  What?  And then people are losing money down there.  The businesses are all fucked.  The restaurants are fucked.  Fucking smelly, fucking camping people.  There's people hurting out there.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, there's people hurting.  But the problem is they got these, you know,  the freaks as the, you know,  what everyone's looking at as the movement, unfortunately.  Right.  Where are the fucking smart people?  Where are they?  Every time I go down there,  it's like these fucking hippies.  They're making money.  Huh?  You think?  They're making money, yeah.  Then what the fuck?  Where do we go from here, Jimmy?  What do you think?  I don't know.  I don't know what they,  I have no idea what they want,  and they don't know what they want,  so it's hard to pick a future.  You were all in in the beginning, too, right?  Yes.  You were kind of into it.  I was very into what they were doing 
[01:22:30]  because I liked the fact  that they were protesting,  as I saw,  against people that I hated  and I felt were executable,  and that is a lot of these guys,  not because they're billionaires  or because they're rich,  the guys that took government money,  these big payout-taking scumbags,  those are the people.  I don't begrudge rich people at all.  Guys, I don't begrudge Bill Gates.  I don't begrudge Steve Jobs.  I really don't.  They earned their fucking money,  and they earned it with great products,  not working hard,  starting from nowhere, 
[01:23:00]  and not being vultures.  Even rich people that inherit it,  it's these vultures.  Steve Jobs didn't even get paid money  from Apple.  Right, took a dollar a year  and threw Pixar.  Because he was a fucking gazillionaire  off the other company.  Was he making money off the stock, though?  I'm sure he was.  He just wasn't being paid by the company.  A dollar.  That's technical shit.  They do that in corporations all the time.  I mean, you could get paid, too.  But I do feel  that they kind of spun out of control  and just became...  And I like the fact  they didn't have a leader, 
[01:23:30]  but then they just started protesting.  The New York Post  has a great cartoon today  with a bunch of protesters  talking to Michael Moore,  and he's standing on a fucking lawn  that says, for sale.  And they're like,  hey, man, we got kicked out of Zuccotti Park.  Can we stay at your place?  Let's see how many people  Michael Moore has  to his fucking $2 million house.  He won't.  Yeah.  He won't.  That would be a great move on his part.  That would be a great move.  Won't happen.  Won't happen.  And it'll help his business, too,  even more.  He makes money off this stuff.  There's a picture in the paper today.  That guy's fucking 
[01:24:00]  just stuffing his fat face.  He really is a food addict.  Look at all the needles they found.  In the park.  Yeah.  There's a picture in the paper today.  There's one, two, three.  If I had to guess,  30 needles they piled up  that they found  when they were clearing everybody out.  I didn't like the way the cops did that.  Like, I understand there has to be a method,  and a lot of those people were annoying,  but I don't like the fact  they threw fucking people's laptops in a pile.  It's like,  I get like the sleeping bags and shit,  but if you have a laptop computer, 
[01:24:30]  and you're down there,  and you're just fucking,  and you're allowed to be there,  and then all of a sudden  they clear you out?  Right.  Why the fuck are they  throwing out your laptop?  Oh, fuck them.  You're protesting with a laptop in a tent?  You still shouldn't be.  Go home.  Facebooking assholes in a tent.  I agree.  I agree,  but you shouldn't get  your computer thrown out.  They probably said,  look, you know,  you have a certain,  maybe a minute to two minutes  to get your shit  and get the fuck out of here.  No, I think they just cleared them out.  They didn't even do that?  If they did that,  I'd have no problem with it.  I really don't know  how it went down.  The first thing you do  is when something's going down, 
[01:25:00]  you grab your fucking...  If I'm in my house,  if there's a fire or anything,  I'm grabbing my phone  and my computer,  and hopefully,  then my wife and my dog.  If you're on the other side  of the park, though,  and they go,  just get out.  A lot of people, I think,  weren't allowed to go back  and get their stuff.  I think that's how it happened.  They weren't close  to their tents or whatever.  Yeah.  Then that would make sense  because I'm with Bobby.  If I know I'm getting evicted  within a minute or two,  I'm grabbing as much shit  as I can,  leaving my shitty tent behind  and I'm out of there.  That's why I love fucking Boston.  There's no fucking...  There's nothing  because Boston cops would just,  get the fuck out of here, 
[01:25:30]  you cocksucker,  and punch him in the face.  Well...  You know,  New York cops get shit.  They're under scrutiny.  They can't do anything  without fucking being subjected  as villains.  I feel bad for them.  Yeah.  You can't...  There's no way  you're going to clean that park out  and look good  as a New York cop.  No, I understand.  I don't have any problem  with the cops  breaking people's heads open  if they're fucking rowdy.  I don't.  I just think that  if they say  you got to go right now,  you should get a minute  to get your fucking laptop  and get your shit  without having to  throw it in a dumpster. 
[01:26:00]  I gotta say,  because I've been down there  at least ten times,  it was intense down there  between the cops  and the protesters.  They sort of got along  with each other,  but you knew at any moment  it could get really ugly.  So I think when the city  decided,  okay,  we're going to do this,  they weren't thinking  like that, Jimmy.  They were like,  we got to clear  this fucking place out.  We only have  a certain amount of time  before this could get  really ugly.  And it's terrifying  to be a cop.  You forget the cops  are fucking human  and to actually  get into an altercation  with another human being,  it fucks you up. 
[01:26:30]  It doesn't matter.  All the training you have,  everything that you know  you should do  goes out the fucking window.  Right.  And you just go on pure  like,  fuck you,  get the fuck down,  get the fuck out of you.  You don't use reason.  You're just like,  I got to do a job.  But they do have reason.  That's why we give them  the position of having guns  and names  and we trust them with that.  We do.  Most of them do,  but sometimes  it gets a little fucked up  and they're human.  But these weren't exactly,  okay.  No,  I was just saying  they had a system  and they realized  we got to do 
[01:27:00]  boom,  boom,  boom  and get this fucking  place cleared immediately.  Yeah.  So I don't think they,  I don't think it was an option  for the city  to allow anyone  to actually grab their shit.  But just laptop,  I have a problem  with people's laptop computers  being thrown out.  I don't know if it was thrown out  because they're now saying,  they're in piles,  they're broken.  They're broken.  Oh,  here's the deal though.  Well,  because they're saying  that the protesters  could go up somewhere  on 57th Street  and claim their shit.  It's a giant,  it was trucks of garbage.  Okay.  And they put them  in garbage trucks  and it's like,  again,  fuck the annoyance 
[01:27:30]  of the protesters,  I get all that.  Was it PC or Mac?  That's an excellent question  because PC would have  looked perfect in the garbage.  Right,  exactly.  But I just don't think  it's right that you get  your laptop thrown out  and as much,  you can be emotional  and say fuck the protesters,  I agree with that.  Yep.  But there's no reason  to throw a guy's laptop.  You can't,  you can't,  I guarantee it was like,  look,  we can't let anybody back in  because there's always  going to,  dude,  can I just grab my,  all right,  go ahead.  That guy goes back in,  starts a fucking fire  and starts stabbing people  and then that,  you know.  I think it's just a tough spot 
[01:28:00]  for everyone involved.  Then they shouldn't be afraid  to break heads.  Like,  I'm not going in such a direction  going to these poor protesters.  If they get out of line,  they should have their fucking  head smashed  with a nightstick.  A lot of the guys  I saw down there  were not reasonable  where a cop would go,  okay,  we're going to do this,  but we're going to give you  two to three minutes  to go to your tent  and get your shit.  Jimmy doesn't mind  if they fucking crack  their heads open  but if you break a laptop,  come on.  Because I believe  in reasonable behavior.  It's pretty personal  if someone grabs your laptop,  I get it.  Yeah,  it throws garbage  with everybody else,  it's fucking ridiculous  and then somebody  can just go in 
[01:28:30]  and you don't have  all your stuff archived.  These protesters  just go in  and grab somebody's fucking,  somebody else's laptop,  it's fucking shitty.  I mean,  look,  dude,  you're thinking  what you have  on your computer,  all the shit  that could get you  fucking thrown in jail  and all this stuff.  You have banking information.  No, I know,  but it just annoys me  that they did it like that.  It's only about the computer.  And someone's saying  they did give them  a certain amount of time.  I would love to know  how much time.  Oh, if they did,  that's one thing.  Okay.  But like Jimmy's saying,  if you're on the other side  of the park,  you probably don't have enough time  because now everyone's  running around. 
[01:29:00]  Plus the fact  there were so many tents down there  it wasn't easy to move around  in the actual park anymore.  They just had little paths  that you had to squeeze by people  if you wanted to walk around.  Stupid.  Get them the fuck out of there.  Well, they should have  got them out faster.  Who the fuck  can you get to take over  a section of a...  Well, it's a privately owned park.  Privately owned.  It's different.  It's different.  Did the guy let...  Zuccotti was okay with it.  Yeah, he was fine with it.  Yeah.  Whatever his name is, yeah.  Yeah, the management company.  I forget.  Yeah, it was weird.  They didn't say  throw them right out.  It was a public...  If it was a city park 
[01:29:30]  that would have lasted  three days or two days  and they would have been done.  Yeah.  Okay.  So...  Look at fucking Bloomberg's neck.  He's the worst.  Oh, looks like a fat lady  songwriter.  You know what?  Let's go to the phones here  because they might have  more info than us.  Who's this, brother?  Hey, Opie.  It's Cassius.  Oh, Cassius.  What's up, bud?  Yeah, how you doing?  Yeah, man.  Yesterday,  I was reading news reports.  They were given, like,  I think like a half hour  to pack up their stuff.  You know, it wasn't a matter  of the cops saying, you know,  you've got to leave 
[01:30:00]  just this instant.  Oh, okay.  In that case,  I didn't know that.  Then good.  A half hour is plenty of time.  That's plenty of time.  But knowing what I saw down there,  a lot of people would be like,  fuck you.  We're not leaving.  And wasting their 30 minutes.  Fair enough.  Okay, I didn't know that,  but I heard that.  I saw a lot of those  type of people down there.  You know, I tell it like I see it.  Yeah, but a lot of these people  want to be victims, too,  because they, you know,  if they're,  they did this  and they have to be victims.  They threw my laptop.  They hit me.  Fuck off.  Right.  There's plenty of time  to get the fuck out of there.  I was watching.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry. 
[01:30:30]  They started chanting  to wake everybody.  You know,  they got all involved  with chanting,  saying the cops are here,  the cops are here.  And then so people had to wake up  and they were all involved  in like hooking themselves together  in a chain,  a human chain,  like a human chain.  Yeah, see,  that's what they did  with their 30 minutes.  I forgot about that.  Cassius is absolutely right.  They formed a human chain,  Jimmy.  Do they know that  they have to leave the park?  As the clock is ticking, yeah.  Okay.  And the protesters knew  this was coming.  They just didn't know when.  And they probably knew  it would happen  in the middle of the night  when the media wasn't around  because you don't want, 
[01:31:00]  you know,  CNN and the rest of them  that are hanging out  on a regular basis  filming this shit.  I was watching a live stream  yesterday  and this guy  was just live streaming.  It was fucking awesome.  It was awesome  just to watch  as it's going down.  And this one guy,  though,  had his live stream camera  right in the cop's face  basically taunting him  the entire fucking time.  And the cop  was so fucking cool.  He wouldn't budge.  He wouldn't fucking budge at all.  Because they see their pensions.  Right. 
[01:31:30]  You know that  if you fucking smash  this guy's face.  But the tolerance it takes  to be in that position.  Wow.  Good for that guy.  If it was in Boston  he would have fucking  cracked him in the head.  He would have kicked  the plug out  and knocked his teeth out.  Yeah.  Took the plug out,  took his camera,  smashed it,  and then fucking  ass fucked him.  You know,  NYPD doesn't play either, Bobby.  They don't play,  but they get...  They don't play.  They get scrutinized.  Lately they've been...  They get scrutinized.  Lately they got a lot more eyes on them,  but they don't play.  There was also a report  of an older cop  actually crying  as he was taking part 
[01:32:00]  in tearing down  the tents and stuff.  He was actually crying, man.  Why?  Well, it became a little...  It became a little...  I can't call it a city,  like a tent town.  Yeah, he was crying  because of the smell  of those fucking hippies.  Exactly.  I heard it stunk too.  Fucking moldy food.  Oh, the sanitation guys,  you know,  and they do this for a living,  they said the smells...  I gotta find the fucking...  Yeah.  Stupid oily people.  They're out of their minds.  They use oil  instead of soap  and fucking cologne.  There's no...  Truly,  whatever the fuck that shit is.  Healthy people...  Healthy people...  A lot of times stink.  I was in a... 
[01:32:30]  I ate at this place, Gobo,  which is a great vegan restaurant  on 6th Avenue.  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing food.  I'm looking at this couple  and the guy  who just looked like unshaven  but greasy,  dirty unshaven.  I'm like,  you fucking...  Most of you vegans  just look gross.  Greasy vegan?  Does that mean  they don't use dirt?  No, it's little rocks.  There's nothing worse  than a hot...  I like eating healthy  but vegan, fuck that.  Dude, this place,  Gobo,  is fucking great.  Give me a nice grilled chicken  and some veggies.  Sure.  Those hot chicks  who don't shower.  I don't mind that.  I fucking hate that.  Little underarm hair, 
[01:33:00]  pussy stink.  Seriously.  Stupid, dried,  naughty hair.  I don't like that.  Hey, Sam,  what do you got over there?  There's a timeline  of when everything happened.  Yeah, go ahead.  So the police...  Boring.  ...showed up with bulldozers.  Z's.  No, what's up with that, Sam?  It's an answer to your question.  No, no, fair enough.  Go ahead.  The police showed up  with bulldozers.  Boo.  Jesus,  your voice is just  fucking drizzled.  Jesus,  go ahead,  Salmon X. 
[01:33:30]  Salmon X.  Oh, here it is.  At 120.  And they didn't start  really taking people out  until 2 o'clock,  so people,  by the time,  people had 40 minutes.  So, Jimmy,  they really did have time.  They really did have time.  If you were aware  of the situation,  you knew they meant business.  That's all that matters.  You go and get your fucking laptop  at the very least.  And also,  they have the option  to go and retrieve  the stuff that is taken  away from them.  But Jimmy's saying,  and I'm looking at the picture, 
[01:34:00]  I mean,  there's a pile  just in some kind of,  I don't even know  where this is.  It's on 57th Street.  57th Street.  Yeah, it's a sanitation facility,  and it's just a pile  of garbage, basically.  That looks like a garbage dump.  City sanitation workers  yesterday were forced  to pick through  a filthy pile of property  seized from Zuccotti Park,  including dirty  hypodermic needles,  moldy food,  and glass-littered  broken gadgets.  I pick up garbage  for a living,  and these were some  of the worst smells  I've ever experienced  when worker grumbled  to the fucking page. 
[01:34:30]  Did they shit down?  They have like a  port-a-potting?  Well, it's funny  you should say that,  because as 10 unlucky  sanitation workers  sorted the trash  from reclaimable goods,  so now they got  all this stuff  in this sanitation area,  and now they're  sorting through to go,  okay, this is actual garbage,  and this we've got to save  in case the protester  comes back to claim it.  They steered clear  of a sealed pickle bucket,  which they suspected  was filled with human waste.  Among the trash  were clothes, 
[01:35:00]  suitcases,  papers,  plywood books,  laptop computers,  smeared peanut butter jars,  cables,  wires,  shoes,  it just goes on.  Why smeared peanut  butter jars?  I don't know.  Rats must have loved  it down there.  Supposedly there were  rats running around  a little bit.  Bed bugs,  lice.  Oh, fucking bed bugs.  They said fleas.  Fleas was a big one.  There were a lot  of dogs down there.  A lot of scary  fucking dogs.  People probably  protected their property  with their dogs.  It got scarier  and scarier  to go down there.  I mean,  I went down, 
[01:35:30]  off and on,  you know,  it was down there  for two months  and the last time  I went down there  I'm like,  man,  I'm not hanging out  in the actual park anymore.  It was fucking scary.  I never went.  I wish I would have went once.  People changed.  People changed from this  almost like,  hey, man,  free love type of vibe  to hardcore criminals.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Guys that...  Yeah, they knew  it was free food down there.  Guys that I had no doubt  would fuck you up  if you even looked at them wrong.  Those type of guys.  It absolutely changed  by the end of it. 
[01:36:00]  What else you got, Cassius?  Tattooed face guys.  Tattooed face creeps.  A lot of...  I've never seen more face tattoos  than when I went down  to Zuccotti Park.  Really?  A lot of them.  Big...  One guy had this...  You know how they sometimes  do the teardrop?  This guy went all in  with a big fucking teardrop.  What does that mean?  You killed the fat person?  Or he's really sad.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he really...  He watched The Notebook twice.  It was a huge teardrop  on his face.  Huge.  The Notebook was a sad movie. 
[01:36:30]  I didn't see the end of it.  I fucking hated The Notebook.  I just started it.  What's wrong with you?  I haven't finished it.  He built a house for her.  Wait, don't tell me the end.  I didn't see the end.  And then she came back.  Wait, hold on.  And she died.  Yeah, I know.  And then he died.  Yeah.  And then the father died.  Everyone died.  There was one fish  that lived in the lake.  It was...  One fish, huh?  I hated, by the way,  the way he met her.  I hated the way he met her  on the fucking Ferris wheel.  It humiliates her other date.  You hate it  because you could never  hold on that long.  Probably not.  Fish.  And I would be the guy  getting embarrassed.  Like, that's what we're taught 
[01:37:00]  as men.  You're supposed to do  cock block some other guy  on a date.  I wish he would have  fallen to his fucking death.  That's romance?  It's so funny that...  Some jerk-off  cock blocks a guy  on a date?  It's funny how people  see romantic movies  differently.  His fucking shitty  childhood and upbringing,  you see that as a  cock block movie.  It is.  You want him just to die.  Yeah, he's fucking  hanging on and she's  on a date and he's  humiliating her date  by asking her out in front  of him.  Go fuck yourself,  handsome guy.  Handsome guy.  I hope you fall  and your spine just cracks. 
[01:37:30]  Then we'll see  how hot you are.  I would love for Jim  to rewrite movies.  That'd just be the end.  It'd be a fucking  15-minute flick.  Like that nerdy guy  just should have  kicked him in the chest  and watched him  plummet to his death.  That's what you get.  Cock block.  You know the nerdy guy?  You play the nerdy guy  and it just shows you  eating her asshole  out in the parking lot  of the fucking carnival?  Or I finger a button  and I make eye contact  and I go,  that's what you get, madam.  People are confused.  It's not Chaz Bono  doing the Googling today.  That's Sam. 
[01:38:00]  Thank you.  But Chaz does have  a deeper voice than you.  That's not...  But they have  the same facial hair.  Yeah.  What are you eating?  And the same genitals.  BLT.  Yes.  Oh, I love a BLT.  Now I'm hearing Bloomberg  tweeted around 10 o'clock  that they were going  to be there at 1.30.  Giving them a lot  of fucking time.  It wouldn't surprise me  if he tweeted it  that dope.  That is kind of dumb  because that allows  a lot more people  to go down there  which could cause  a situation.  Yeah, he's an  out of control situation.  It doesn't sound right  but you know,  I took a chance  with Horse Jerker.  I don't know why 
[01:38:30]  you take a chance  with Horse Jerker  but I did.  I almost have to.  I did.  Horse Jerker?  What the hell is that?  A guy needs  some feedback.  Oh.  All right.  Did you see  the Onion story?  I think it's on  the front page  this week.  The executives  are up on the 15th floor  looking down  at Ducati Park  betting on  who's going to be  arrested next.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's really funny.  It's a great photo.  See you on your own.  It's not real. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Is it a purple onion?  That would be  an awesome story  if it was actually real.  I would like that.  That's what satire  is about, O.P.  It's not real.  Satire.  But people are mad  that I'm not all in  with this Occupy Wall Street.  It's like,  there's too many  fucking weirdos  down there.  Bloomberg did.  Yeah, yeah.  I want some of these  if there's intelligent people  behind this thing,  they got to move  front and center  and then I would  certainly have  an open mind again.  Well, it's really funny  because what I read  is that the intelligent 
[01:39:30]  people at the center,  they had moved,  they were actually  in one of the buildings.  Somebody gave them  an office space  and they had separated  themselves from the  whole Ducati scene  because they were sick  of how weird it became  and they were actually  up in a building.  A lot of the protesters  that believed in this  in the beginning  either ran out of money,  ran out of patience,  or were pushed out  by the scarier people  that I saw down there,  including the homeless.  There were homeless people  laying around too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Free food 
[01:40:00]  and medical attention.  Did you go down there  at all, Bobby?  I didn't go down  one fucking time.  Why?  Not one fucking time.  Not even for the show?  Not even a fucking time.  I check out stuff  for the show,  not the radio show,  just for the show  that's going on.  I didn't want to see it  at all.  I didn't want to fuck,  I just...  Would it bother you?  I was very busy,  but second of all,  I was busy.  I had my own life to do.  I worry about my world,  not the world,  and that's how  the world comes together.  But, uh...  Fucking chip.  All right.  I did not go down  one time. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  No.  Fucking pisses me off  a bunch of hippies.  Cassius, good job, bro.  Yeah, yeah,  thank you, man.  Thanks a lot.  Let's go to Matt  in Wisconsin.  Matt.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, um,  last night a friend  sent me a link.  It's on YouTube  of some stupid group  called Anonymous.  They put out a threat  on, like,  the NYPD,  Bloomberg.  They're declaring war  on New York, basically.  Well, they're not stupid.  They're computer hackers.  And they're pretty powerful.  Yeah, that's all we need, though. 
[01:41:00]  They're not doing shit.  That's all we need, though.  Yeah, let...  I'm just saying,  Anonymous is...  Some scary people there.  Attack...  We get attacked  by terrorists,  now fucking Anonymous.  Well, you know what?  The NYPD and those guys  have their own  computer people  that are good.  The hackers  and Anonymous  are very savvy  computer guys,  but there's other people  that have them, too.  I mean,  Bloomberg, you think,  can't afford  to hire somebody to...  You know, of course.  Well, what?  They declared...  They can hire  computer hackers,  guys that are just as good, 
[01:41:30]  and they traded  the clear war  on the Zetas  in Mexico  and apparently backed off,  but I've heard,  is it a hoax?  Is it real?  Nobody knows  because nobody's talking.  I don't know,  but I think  this occupies something...  They're going to regroup  and try something.  I don't know why.  My biggest thing is  I just wish they wouldn't  use, like,  a speaking spell  to make the threat.  It's really awful  if you listen to it.  Well, they don't want  any voice.  They have it...  Yeah, they're anonymous.  There's a voice modulator.  What is... 
[01:42:00]  What is this?  Anonymous Revenge  Against the NYPD...  I think this is the video  he's talking about.  Bloomberg.  I think.  How can I be sure?  You want to play this?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on the line there,  Matt.  All right.  We are Legion.  We do not forgive.  We do not forget.  It's my audition.  I want to do voiceovers.  There you go.  Expect us. 
[01:42:30]  Hello, citizens  of the Internet  and the world.  We are anonymous.  We have witnessed  the violent  and forceful removal  of the entire occupation  at Zuccotti Park.  It is time  to engage  the NYPD  and Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  It is time  to cause complete  and utter civil disobedience.  It is time  to wage war  in New York City.  We must destroy  the NYPD  and anything  that has to do  with Michael Bloomberg.  We must dox  each and every 
[01:43:00]  single officer.  We must destroy  them from the inside  and out.  They hurt women,  senior citizens,  first responders  of the World Trade Center,  union members  and veterans  of wars.  We must unite  to show the New York City  Police Department  and Mayor Michael Bloomberg  they now have become  a target of anonymous.  We call upon  every last anonymous member  to quickly  and immediately  take action  against the NYPD  and Bloomberg.  Recently, 
[01:43:30]  anonymous failed  to act upon  several well-circulated  operations such as  Vox Hunt  however it is time  for anonymous  to show how much  power we truly have  and inflict a wrath  that no one  has ever witnessed before.  NYPD and Mayor  Michael Bloomberg,  you are about to feel  the wrath of anonymous.  You asked for civil war  and now you have it.  Spread this message  like the plague.  We are anonymous.  We are legion.  We do not forgive.  We do not forget. 
[01:44:00]  Expect us.  When they do a message  I don't think they need  to say stuff like that.  I understand it kind of  sounds cool  but they don't need to say  we are legion.  You don't need to do that.  The message you're sending out  is that you're pissed off  about something  and you're going to  target people  however anonymous gets you.  But I think that  they're misguided  when they're going  after the NYPD.  Yeah, you target them  and you're also putting  my life,  my wife's life  and everybody else's  life in jeopardy  in New York City. 
[01:44:30]  We're already under  fucking attack  all the time  getting nuked  or blown up  or a fucking plane  flown into a fucking  building or a bomb  in a subway  and now we're going  to worry about  a bunch of fucking  nerds on the internet  fucking attacking them.  What the fuck?  Leave us alone.  Go fuck yourselves.  And the, uh,  well Bob,  I meant, you know,  uh, sorry.  No, no, no.  I just lost it.  Uh, fuck.  Oh, the first responders.  Because they mentioned  the first responders  but a lot of those  first responders  were cops and firemen  or especially the cops  and on September 10th 
[01:45:00]  would have been considered  the same cops  that you're going  to target now.  Yeah.  It's like that's all  first responders are  is their police officers  and firemen.  They're just,  they're regular beat cops,  regular fucking firefighters.  These are not like,  they, they, they were not  in a part of a special unit  called first responders.  They became that by default.  So it's like,  when you target these cops  and, you know what I mean?  It's like, you,  whether you mean to or not,  you're targeting the same people  that are first responders.  So it's like,  if you're going to separate 
[01:45:30]  them like that,  the respect you have  for the first responders,  you should have  for these cops  because any of these cops  that are around right now  would have been there  if it was an option.  If something happens now,  those are the people  that are going to be there  to save lives now.  And, and we're,  we're constantly  under fucking attack.  The way, the way they,  but the thing with Anonymous,  the thing with Anonymous is  that might not represent  the entire group.  That could just be one or,  there's no real spokesman.  You know what?  It's, it's good you say that  because John is saying 
[01:46:00]  exactly that as well.  John, you got info on this  or you're just talking  out of your ass?  No, I'm not talking  out of my ass  and I don't know anyone  in Anonymous,  but I, you know,  run around in that  type of world before  and I just wanted  to explain real quick.  Denial of service attacks  and things like that  are not like,  Anonymous can't go  into your personal  bank account  and take all of your,  you know,  personal stuff away  from you.  They cannot.  Some of them probably can.  What?  Some of them probably can though. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, there's some guys  that are really good on computers.  They're really good, yes,  but that stuff is,  all that stuff,  all that banking information  is stored on secured servers  with backups.  Even if it were to crash  for any reason at all,  it's backed up somewhere.  They cannot by any means  wreck your life.  That shit is paper-trailed  and documented.  Can they go in  and make some adjustments  to shit?  This isn't 1994.  Is it the movie Hackers?  That shit cannot be done  that way successfully  for more than like  a couple hours. 
[01:47:00]  They're good at  denial of service attacks,  shutting things down  temporarily,  costing massive bandwidth bills  to corporations  who in turn  go through insurance companies  and we end up paying for it  because we pay for  their general liability insurance  for you guys' own companies.  So, we're all fucked.  And the other thing,  Danny and Bowling Green,  that YouTube clip  wasn't anonymous.  It was somebody  trying to convince anonymous  to take action.  So, you don't even know  if it's them.  Very possible  because the cops 
[01:47:30]  handled themselves  really restrained  in Zuccotti Park.  They didn't just go through  and start kicking it.  They backed off once  and anybody I know  who was down there,  cops and people who were,  they weren't knocking  people apart.  They weren't beating  the shit out of people.  It wasn't some brutal...  It's so funny.  In this country,  if this was any other country,  they would have fucking  bulldozed them.  Of course they would have.  Ran them fuck over  with...  Remember in Egypt,  the fucking cops  were just flying down  the street  running people over.  They didn't give a fuck  who was in the way.  Yeah, look what happens  in Syria,  how they handle protesters. 
[01:48:00]  And I'm like,  we're obviously  a different society than that,  but just because the cops  finally came in  and cleared it out,  don't act like there were  these brutal, awful guys  who went in  and just beat the shit  out of old ladies.  You got your fucking Acer  1,600 fucking broken.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, that seemed like...  That YouTube video  does seem like...  It doesn't seem like  it's the entire organization  because there's a lot of them  that...  I don't know how they work.  I shouldn't pretend I do.  I don't know how they work.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  Frank, what do you got?  What's up, Bo?  Hey.  Listen, what I was thinking 
[01:48:30]  is if this...  You know,  when you look at the laws  that are on the books today,  all these anti-terrorism laws,  you need to treat  with every word you say  carefully.  And what these dummies  don't realize  is by putting a threat  like that out  and then following through  with some actual hack  either against the NYPD  or any form of government,  they're basically exposing  them up themselves  to a domestic terrorism charge.  So, what would be funnier  than watching some twerp  sit in faith in 200 years 
[01:49:00]  for wanting to play  tough guy for the day?  They got a lot...  It's funny.  They did arrest a lot of them  on some...  Because, again,  if they really want to get you,  like, if the government  or whoever it is...  If they hire computer people  who are as good  to backtrace...  A lot of these guys  know how to, I guess,  not get caught.  I have no idea  how you mask your identity online.  I just don't know how to do it.  You don't even know  how to set up  a fucking router.  What's that?  Yes, I do.  I'm kidding.  I was kidding.  I really don't.  You don't?  You know what a router is? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Where there's a fucking  traffic accident  and someone who's showing you  the other street to go down.  There you go, Jimmy.  You tell them.  Or somebody...  It routes things.  Or it's the team  who fucking wins  by a lot of points.  I love the show.  Patrice O'Neal rule.  Yes, he does.  We love Patrice O'Neal.  And we don't have an update,  by the way.  Because everyone's bothering us  on Twitter,  and I don't blame you,  but we just don't have  an update.  Yeah.  That's your update.  Yeah.  There is no update.  He's a good dude.  Thank you, Frank.  You're still sick  and need your prayers. 
[01:50:00]  Bye.  All right.  I think that...  I mean,  not just because  I play a cop on TV.  I am an officer  George Moore  on the new hit show  that's coming out,  maybe,  hopefully,  on CBS.  Oh, it's not out yet.  I thought it was airing.  No, it's a mid-season replacement,  but what happened is...  You know what happened?  Oh, Bobby.  CBS.  Oh, no.  What is it for you?  Every show that came out  is a hit.  Of course.  Oh, so you need a spot to... 
[01:50:30]  You need a show to bomb.  Ah.  What's their lineup?  And which happens...  Let's pick the show  that needs to go away for you.  All right.  Do mid-season replacements  ever become big hits?  Maybe they do.  Yeah.  All the fucking time.  Sure they do.  Absolutely.  And you need...  I'm sure they have  a pretty good track record.  And you need shows to bomb.  Oh, she canceled.  Every show's a hit.  So what do we got on CBS?  You're looking at  A Gifted Man.  Nobody watches that.  The Amazing Race.  The Big Bang Theory.  Big Brother.  Oh, shit. 
[01:51:00]  Blue Bloods.  Hit.  Nobody watches that.  Criminal Minds.  That's stupid.  Oh, fuck.  CSI.  Oh, fuck.  CSI Miami.  Nobody watches that.  CSI New York.  That's terrible.  Oh, shit.  The Good Wife.  That's a bomb.  Hit.  Hawaii Five-0.  Nobody watches that.  How I Met Your Mother.  That stinks.  Oh, shit.  How to Be a Gentleman.  I've never heard of it.  Interrogation Tuesday.  What about Two Broke Girls?  How about Two Broke Girls?  One of the highest paid actors in TV.  Who?  The Mentalist.  Wait a minute.  Is How to Be a Gentleman a hit with Kevin Dillon?  It's new, so it's not hard to say. 
[01:51:30]  But they're going to give Kevin Dillon a shot.  Yeah.  They're going to give him a chance to fucking find his audience.  Mentalist.  Mike and Molly.  Hit.  NCIS.  Hit.  NCIS Los Angeles.  Bingo.  Hit.  Person of Interest.  Huge.  That fucking show is one of the biggest shows ever.  This show is huge.  It's giant.  You know what?  I got it, though, Bobby.  Wait, wait.  We got more.  We do?  Rules of Engagement.  Oh, shit.  That's a big hit.  Survivor.  The Avery knows that show.  Two and a half men.  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  I asked a coach.  What an edgy guy.  Seinfeld was him.  Don't pay for sex.  You're not a man.  What a fucking girl.  Seinfeld was a mid-season replacement, I believe.  Yes.  Was it really?  I believe so.  I believe the fuck so.  Yeah, dude.  It's fucked.  Usually, I mean, that's a fucking lineup.  I got the show we could get rid of.  But it wasn't doing well, by the way, Seinfeld, until they believed in it, so they kept it.  60 minutes.  Hear me out.  60 minutes.  It's time for that show to move on.  My show is only 42 minutes with commercials. 
[01:52:30]  But they don't have Andy Rooney, so it's time to move on.  You get rid of 60 minutes, and then you slide your show that you're on right in that spot Sunday nights, Bobby.  Think about it.  After football.  I do one line every week, pretty much.  But there's one scene where we're in Harlem, and I got to run up and, stop, stop, police, get down.  And I got to draw my gun on somebody, running up, get down on the ground, police.  And I was supposed to put the handcuffs on them, but I was too heavy when I bent down. 
[01:53:00]  I couldn't get the cuffs on, so I just, I whispered in there, like, hold these.  And I just put them in, I put them in his hands.  So it's hard being a cop, is what I'm saying.  Yeah, how are you going to catch that perp?  Bobby just gave us some TV magic.  I couldn't find.  Some of the things they do.  Yeah, they say just hold them in your hands.  NBC might be taking community off.  Yeah, I hear, what's up with that? 
[01:53:30]  They're saying that's not the case.  Well, it's not on the January schedule, so.  Why would they take that?  Is that a hit?  No.  It's a critical hit.  The critics love it, but it's not finding the audience in need.  That's the same with 30 Rock, though.  That was critical.  But 30 Rock had just enough to fucking squeak by.  I thought Community was a massive hit.  Do you think they're a...  People who watch it love it.  Do you think the alternative, that's kind of an alt-y, you know, kind of comedy, inside kind of comedy,  do you think that's going away?  I mean, what happens is that a lot of times the critical hits are great shows, which don't get the audience, 
[01:54:00]  and a lot of times they're snarky and annoying, but The Wire was critically acclaimed,  and it didn't have an audience like The Sopranos, but it should have been.  Like, The Sopranos was critically acclaimed.  But The Wire was fucking...  Holy shit.  Just because the critics like it, it doesn't mean it's...  Like, a lot of times they pick the right fucking shows, and they're right.  Right.  And sometimes they pick something that's just kind of quirky and I think is awful.  But it still needs that number.  I thought Community was huge, though.  It's a whole number.  I mean, it's really...  They're just not hitting it.  It's a great show.  Arrested Development was the same way, right? 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Love Arrested Development.  How many people watch Community?  I swear to God, I thought that was a fucking 20 million people a week show.  And it's in its third season, too.  No reason to humiliate me, Eric.  So they gave you a chance.  How to Be a Gentleman was canceled already, Bobby.  So what's...  What's it really?  What's in that slot?  How to Be a Gentleman.  I don't know.  I'm just reading this to somebody.  How many weeks did they give that?  Oh, is that the Kevin Dillon show?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I think I read that.  It looked awful.  I thought they were going to give it a shot.  He's been...  Thank you, Steven Manhattan.  How to Be a Gentleman.  That guy booked a gig for eight years as an awful actor. 
[01:55:00]  I never...  I don't know.  It's like Tracy Morgan booking the gig as the crazy comic fucking black dude.  It's a perfect gig.  It's the only way you'd ever stay in the fucking business.  You don't want to...  No, but How to Be a Gentleman.  It sounded like it was fun.  Like, the one guy...  The one guy is...  Like, I guess, like, wears a suit and tie or whatever.  And his friend doesn't.  And he's out of Be a Gentleman.  He's wiping his mouth with the guy's tie. 
[01:55:30]  It's like, oh, boy.  Good luck, you two.  Is there a clip of that, by the way?  I swear to this is how shallow I am.  I'm judging it by the movie poster, by the show poster.  We love your country.  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program?  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  Nice.  That was a good clip.  By the way, the community, like last week, did a 1.5 where Big Bang Theory did a 5.3.  Okay.  I didn't realize that.  You watch Big Bang Theory?  I do.  I don't.  I do.  I watch Community. 
[01:56:00]  I bet you E-Rock watches.  Is there a clip?  Yes, I do.  It's because it's when he makes me fall out of bed.  Is there a...  Come on, E-Rock.  That was a good one.  Best show on TV, Psych.  I never saw it.  What is it?  Psych is on USA Network.  It's fucking hilarious.  I want to see a clip.  Who's in it?  It's hilarious.  Gentlemen.  Who's in it?  James Roday and Dooley Hill.  Oh, I don't know.  Let's think of the big names.  James Roday and Dooley Hill?  I don't know who they are.  Very big names.  I'm busy.  Because of Psych?  Dooley Hill?  No, Dooley Hill was on...  West Wing.  West Wing.  Yeah, I'm mixing up with the guys Noted. 
[01:56:30]  And James Roday played the...  Dooley Noted.  Dooley.  Oh, wait.  This is it.  Here we go.  Here we go, guys.  I want to be a gentleman.  Here we go.  Here's the preview.  So this is their best shit.  It's already a gigantic office, which I love.  Yeah, this is their best shit to get people to watch, so...  Pulled out all the stops.  I've got some good news.  Magazine's been sold.  New owners are changing the entire format.  Your How to Be a Gentleman column is just too tame.  This is unacceptable.  What do they expect me to do? 
[01:57:00]  Betray my core ideals and churn out mindless drivel for the lowest common denominator?  That'd be great.  Sam.  The show is about my character, Andrew Carlson, and he is a...  Is that...  He's hilarious, this guy.  Dave Foley?  No, this guy right here?  David Hornsby.  Oh, yeah.  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  Fuck.  That's just the way it is.  He sings.  No, no, no.  Not Puck.  It's him, right?  The Hutch.  The Hutch?  Yes!  That's the Hutch.  Yes, of course.  David Hornsby.  From our favorite show ever.  From Joe Schmo. 
[01:57:30]  I love it when Joe Schmo people show up.  Yes.  One of the greatest shows ever made.  Who is it?  I don't know.  Joe Schmo is a reality show that...  It's at least 10 years old now when reality shows were really hot.  You guys bring it down a little bit?  Because I'm having a stress test today.  Okay.  And my heart is getting a little crazy.  Joe Schmo.  Oh, my God.  They set up a house like a reality show.  Yeah.  Right?  And everyone was in on the gag except for the Joe Schmo guy.  Matt Kennedy Gould.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Who was just a dope.  He was the greatest casting of any show ever. 
[01:58:00]  Ever.  So he...  This guy...  That guy was actually not in on it.  No.  Well, this guy was.  He was the only guy...  Yeah.  The guy that Sam's talked about was the only guy not in on it, which made this show so great  to watch because the viewers are in on it, too.  And this guy, David Hornsby, was the Hutch.  The Hutch.  Would he just hang out in the living room and hold dishes?  The show still holds up.  You've got to get the DVDs.  Bobby, you should watch Joe Schmo.  I'm telling you, man.  Kristen Wiig started on Joe Schmo. 
[01:58:30]  Kristen Wiig was on it.  Fucking Kevin Smith's pal there.  That sounds like a show.  Oh, fuck.  Help me out.  The host of the show.  Oh, Ralph Garman.  Ralph Garman's on it.  And that one guy who played the gay sort of ethnic guy ended up doing a show for VH1.  Oh, I got to see.  Is it on YouTube?  I had one of his bags.  It's a Garman bag.  What is he doing, man?  I'm just a very silly movie.  He's in a Hutch. 
[01:59:00]  It's hanging out in the living room and holding dishes.  I like that because it took me literally three seconds.  I was like, huh?  What?  I want to see a clip from The Gentleman Show.  But you don't understand how cool that is that that's the Joe Schmo, one of the Joe Schmo  guys.  You don't understand.  Can you see this on Netflix, Joe Schmo?  The whole show is on YouTube.  YouTube?  I got to check it.  That's a great idea.  You can just buy the DVDs.  It's worth it.  I'm not buying DVDs.  I fucking love that dumb show.  It's 2011.  All right.  Anyways.  So that guy, you think that's him? 
[01:59:30]  That's definitely him.  David Hornsby is the Hutch.  The Hutch.  All right.  Go back to the clip.  The show got canceled.  Hang on.  There's an ad now.  Did How to Be a Gentleman really get canceled?  Already?  Hit the lowest prices of the season with hundreds of items on sales stores.  Why would we give him a free commercial?  Does anybody have a banana?  My stomach's crawling.  Why are you saying it like that?  I need a banana. 
[02:00:00]  Plus, you would send someone out to get one.  Not ask if anybody just has one.  But Kenny put his foot down and said, no fruit today, for whatever reason.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Kenny said, no fruit today.  I need potassium.  He said, no fruit today.  I don't know why.  I need a banana.  Andrew Carlson?  Yeah.  That's him.  Bert's a man's man.  Bert Lansing from high school.  This is my gym.  I took the place over for my old man when he got sick.  Cancer of the penis.  I'm messing with you, dude.  His penis is fine. 
[02:00:30]  Andrew isn't.  I love you, but you're fussy, you talk weird, and you dress like a ship captain.  I'll be your friend, Andrew.  I'm just looking out for you like I always have.  Oh, like when I was in third grade and you walked into my homeroom on the first day of school and said,  don't beat up my little brother.  He's very weak and has no peripheral vision.  He gets that from me.  I literally can't see this.  See, that I can, but nothing.  Andrew, I've got some news. 
[02:01:00]  Magazine's been sold.  Your how-to-be-a-gentleman column is just too tame.  No more urbane and upscale.  We're going young and sexy.  We should both walk in there right now and tell them we are not changing a thing.  I was thinking about doing that, and then I remembered, I'm 50.  And I'm very excited about the new direction, as is my new boss, who, by the way, is the same age as my son.  It's so great.  If we can get you signed up for a membership, Bronco, the sooner we do that, the sooner we can get you an adult male body. 
[02:01:30]  The trainer just ended up being this creep from high school who beat me up all the time.  Who, Johnny?  No.  Steven?  No.  Agent Steven.  I guess he got beat up a lot in high school is what they're going for there.  This is, uh...  There wasn't one laugh in there.  That's fucking...  Terrible.  Terrible, and I hate the canned laughter, the canned rolling laughter.  It just kept rolling.  Oh, my fucking...  God, is that bad.  Doing this. 
[02:02:00]  Can we do the...  Just rolling it.  Can we have that on this show?  Just can't laugh.  Jim, you know, man, you look crazy with that fucking beard.  I'm crazy like a fox.  Yeah, well, you know, maybe I should get you a pet fox.  Yeah, I was going to pet fox, but fox did hand.  Sam's hair looks like a fox.  Yeah, he looks like a pretty fox-y.  What?  Fox-y?  You mean hot. 
[02:02:30]  What's that sound?  I just farted.  What's that noise?  What noise?  That.  What noise?  I don't hear it.  You're going crazy, Chip.  What's that?  That's weird, that sound.  I don't like it.  It's only Doom, man.  That's all I do.  How about you write a good joke?  This is better.  Write a good joke, and then you don't need the stupid laugh track like that. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, like when a guy was rubbing his mouth with a tie, he should have said, what are you  getting, gunk all over your tie?  See, that's good.  That's the Chip Show audience.  David Hornsby is a good actor, though.  Because the Hutch was not a gentleman.  No.  And that guy is a gentleman.  That, that, that show is just, I mean, that's a fucking, you know what I mean.  The Hutch?  You think a little.  He's a talented actor.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I think so, too.  What do you think?  Let me take a break.  That's what Vandley Silva fights.  Why? 
[02:03:30]  I just don't like him.  He's fighting Kung Lee, dude.  That's good.  You know who Kung Lee is?  He's an animal.  He's beating up Anderson Silva.  That's a great fight.  I don't know, dude.  But, you know, they're both, they're, I don't know.  Where's Chael Sonnen?  Oh, shut up.  That's a great fight.  Henderson's fighting Shogun.  Un-fucking-believable.  Then, Henderson wants Jon Jones right after.  Henderson's a fucking tough dude.  He's not going to get Jon Jones right after.  How do you know?  He beat up Fedor, man.  I couldn't believe he beat him.  That was unbelievable.  He fucking knocked him out, and he knocked out Michael Bisping. 
[02:04:00]  But it doesn't mean he gets him right after the fight.  It doesn't mean he gets him, but he could, because who the fuck is Jon Jones going to fight?  I'll agree.  He could possibly get him, but he doesn't get him right away.  What?  Is Rashad ready?  Is he fighting or no?  No.  Oh, he's not hurt.  Not yet.  But Shogun's fucking going to be, I think Shogun's going to fucking put on a great fight, too.  That's a good matchup.  And Kung Lee is a motherfucker.  He's the guy who broke Frank Shamrock's arm.  Ouch.  I'm just sick of Vandalista.  Why?  How could you be sick of him?  He's the nicest guy in the business.  I didn't say I don't like him, and I wouldn't love the shit. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, you did.  You just said fuck him.  I'll punch him in the face as you said that.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, Bobby.  Let's slow down a little bit.  Why would you say that about him?  He's saying he's going to threaten Vandalay.  You need that potassium.  He's getting weak.  Bananas.  Bananas.  Listen.  No fruit today.  Vandalay is a nice guy.  I'm sure he is.  He's still a motherfucker.  I'm sure he is.  All right.  We have to break just because we have a shitload of live reads today.  Listen.  Troy put this together.  Remember Jennifer Hutt?  I don't remember her.  Yeah.  She was on the show.  She was in here. 
[02:05:00]  She does a show on Martha's Network.  You guys insulted her a lot.  Is she cool?  She's very cool.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  Troy put this together from her appearance on the show.  That's right.  Hargis Films presents an O&A guide to meeting your neighboring radio show host.

[02:10:00]  What happened?  Bob just hurt himself.  Oh, I thought you were singing along to this music!  Did you do?  Oh!  It's going with the music, though.  Keep it going.  Hit his other hand.  Hit his other hand.  What did he do?  Oh!  Did you sit on your own hand?  No!  What happened?  My, my little, my pinky finger got caught on the stupid chair and went underneath the fucking  stupid... 
[02:10:30]  Ah!  Under the console and got caught.  My little thin pinky nail.  Oh!  The thin pinky nail?  The little nail, baby boy!  Kissy!  Okay.  Let me see your, let me see your pinky.  I got two different pinky fingers, though.  I have very underdeveloped pinkies.  I'm willing to admit.  I have two different ones.  I have stumpy thumbs and underdeveloped pinkies.  What's wrong with your hands?  I have this...  I don't know.  I mean, the rest of me is perfect, obviously, but the hands are...  Yeah, that body is amazing.  The fucking hands are a wreck.  Oh, fucking...  For a ginger, you're hot.  Yeah.  Fucking perfect stuff. 
[02:11:00]  I have two different...  Look how small my pinkies are.  I have a V!  What?  I don't have a V!  Yes, you do.  Oh, yeah.  You have the V dickab.  Yeah.  The way that shirt hugs that body?  Fuck me.  Look how much smaller my pinky is compared to the rest of the fingers.  I know it's supposed to be smaller, but I think it's supposed to be way up here, though.  But look how fat my pinky is compared to the other pinky.  I have two different...  What the fuck, dude?  Let me see.  When I used to get into fights, I used to throw punches, and I broke this pinky like nine  times.  Really?  I used to throw hooks. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I never threw straight.  I used to throw these wild hooks.  You'd also get them caught in your mouth.  Wow.  Does anybody have any trident?  You used to roundhouse?  I used to roundhouse, and I used to punch people with my two little knuckles instead of  the big fat knuckles that...  I used to break my hand all the time.  How's your pinky?  It's all right?  It's fucked up.  Look at it.  It's a little stubby pinky.  No, I mean, how was the latest injury?  You good?  This one hurts.  Thank God I'm going to see a doctor. 
[02:12:00]  That hurt.  That hurt.  By the way, Bob, you can see Bob's little broken pinky tomorrow at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Our big thanks-for-nothing Thanksgiving event is tomorrow, 8 a.m.  Hopefully, we'll get there a little earlier.  I think we should get there a little bit earlier, isn't it?  What?  I'm going to get there a few minutes early.  Five of.  Okay.  That's fucking good, you guys.  A little extra time.  I can't wait for tomorrow.  I love the ONA live event.  I haven't done one.  I haven't done one in a long time.  And you're going, right?  You're in, right?  I live literally down the street from it. 
[02:12:30]  And Voss will be there.  Voss is coming?  I'm not going.  Yes.  And we're doing...  Should we say what we're doing?  Yeah, we've been talking about it.  Oh, good.  Our Thanksgiving play.  Yeah.  What?  We're doing a Thanksgiving play.  Yeah, the first Thanksgiving.  Tomorrow.  You're doing the play tomorrow?  We all are.  Who's we?  Everyone.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Bobby!  Bobby!  Yay!  First time you're hearing about this, Bobby?  I knew there was something up.  Fucking Roland.  It's not bad.  Roland.  Let me tell you something about fucking Roland.  He's such a little fucking slime ball. 
[02:13:00]  Big fucking.  You just know when he's fucking you.  Because he's a nice guy.  He's not a nice guy.  Why do you assume that we're fucking you?  Because all of a sudden we're doing a play.  You're not really fucking me.  You're fucking...  I can't act my way out of a bag Voss.  And, you know, you're helping everybody else.  Bobby...  What?  What?  Bob is going to be working on Foley sounds.  He's not...  You're not...  You're not casting a role.  Actually, I went to college for that.  Bunker Hill Community College.  You did?  Foley.  Give us a sound right now. 
[02:13:30]  Damn.  That's a horse in here.  That's a horse, man.  Sure it is.  Give me anything.  Give me anything.  Oh, my God.  I thought there was horses.  A windmill.  That's good.  Good God.  It's powering everything.  Do a fire.  A fire.  But you don't use the, like...  Hold on.  Let me take my jacket off.  It's getting warm in here from its fire sounds.  No.  That was a forest fire from far away.  That sounds like paper crinkling.  Did you want to...  You don't use the props for your Foley work.  This is fire.  I went to school for it.  This is fire. 
[02:14:00]  That's an up-close fireplace.  You said fire.  That's a fireplace.  What was your fire?  My fire was if you're in the woods, trapped in a firestorm.  Yes.  How far from the fire am I?  You're around, like...  On mine?  You're around, like, a mile.  A mile.  Is it cold out?  It's cold out on mine.  Stars out?  Stars were out.  Moon?  Moon was clear, yeah.  And the animals around?  Animals.  Horse.  Oh, this horse isn't here again.  I could have closed my eyes and thought they were real.  All right, now I got the picture painted in my head.  Back through your fire. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, boy.  It's getting hot in here.  There's a forest fire a mile away.  I'll say there is.  I'm feeling all the heat now.  This leaf is burning.  The best part, Bobby's trying to sell it.  What does it sound like when the fire truck is coming?  Ooh.  Are they fighting the fire from above, Bobby? 
[02:15:00]  Ooh, a big hot beach.  Damn, that's a helicopter.  I'm in a fucking helicopter.  That's Bob in five minutes on the treadmill.  That's your heart test.  That's what the technician's going to hear.  He's going to have to take his headphones off.  We should just do improv Foley work tomorrow.  Fuck, Bobby.  That's a good idea.  Should we announce the cast of the play?  Yeah, Chip?  Yeah.  I think so.  Sure.  Does anybody have any gum before we start this? 
[02:15:30]  Who's doing what?  Well, I know I ain't doing shit.  Why aren't you even being in it?  You're doing Foley work with Bob.  Yeah, you're working on Foley.  Me and you and Foley.  Yeah, me and Bobby are going to control it for the radio audience.  Bobby's got to be in it.  You're not in it?  Bob's not in a play?  No.  No, we wanted him to help Obi control it.  Here's the deal, because I'm such a fucking good actor.  I'm a good actor, and they want to have jokes and fun.  Dude, everyone, Obi should be in it.  We should all be in it.  Yeah, plus Bob Kelly's like a TV star at this point, so it's not fair.  It would be a good cameo for him to give the play credibility.  We could have a cop run in. 
[02:16:00]  Exactly.  Yo!  Bob, rogue cop.  Why wouldn't I run and do something?  Dude, you know what?  The turkey bull.  Dude, you arrested.  Right.  I run in.  You know what?  Get down on the ground, everybody!  Everybody!  Can I be your cop partner?  Yeah.  Maybe you guys will play cops.  But you just repeat what I say, and I just look at you in a confused way.  That's good.  Get down on the ground, everybody!  Get down on the ground, everybody!  Really?  What?  Yeah, that wasn't it.  That's what I do.  I said you!  Shut your face! 
[02:16:30]  I said you!  Shut your face!  Hey, what the hell?  What happened?  See?  We just do that.  That's good.  That'll be good.  I like that.  All right, we got to roll now.  But we're going to do Foley, too.  Oh, ow!  Ow!  We need to write some Horses and Fire.  Horses and Fire.  Ow!  Want a screeching out?  Eeeeee!  What?  Eeeeee!  Eeeeee!  Eeeeee!  Someone's been to New Hampshire.  What about milk being poured into a glass? 
[02:17:00]  What about milk being poured into a glass?  That's right.  Yeah.  Sounds like a phone.  Yeah, exactly.  That was terrible.  No, it's actually...  Oh, cool.  That's also a piggy drinking.  You're spilling water all over yourself.  You're really into this Foley work.  Can I just say something, though?  You know, somebody was listening and went, well, that was fucking a good one.  Because it was actually liquid being poured into a glass.  All right, I need a napkin.  This is called...  Give me another one. 
[02:17:30]  Go ahead.  Throw him at me.  I'm a fucking...  Dude, I want...  You understand?  A steak.  A steak.  Do you know the Arnold Schwarzenegger's first three movies I did the Foley work?  Who's Arnold Schwarzenegger?  How about Arnold?  No, it's Arnold.  How about a distant bear?  A distant bear?  Distant, though.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  A distant bear.  Yeah.  That was very good.  That was a distant bear.  I can do any...  The sounds of ice skating.  The sounds of...  You guys can't see it, but Bob's moving his feet under the console.  That's what...  Dude, that's...  How about...  Foley people, you have to...  No, I know.  You're in the moment.  You have to use what's around you.  What about a babbling brook?  A babbling brook?  Brook. 
[02:18:30]  Wow.  Waterfall.  A slim jim being snapped.  A slim jim being snapped.  Someone walking through grass.  A paper airplane being thrown.  No, you can do Thanksgiving themes.  How about an Indian boy carving scrimshaw? 
[02:19:00]  How about an Indian boy carving scrimshaw?  Yes.  Good job, son.  Just a dialogue, too.  Listen.  So the Indians...  What's the cast?  Yeah, let's...  Who's the narrator?  The narrator is Roland Campos.  Roland.  Roland!  Will play the part of the narrator.  Yay.  The Indians are to be played by Rich Voss. 
[02:19:30]  Good.  Bobo.  Good.  And I don't know if we want to give away the third one.  Do we?  We can give away the third one.  Sure.  Yeah, okay.  Lyle.  Love it?  Chip.  Chipperson.  Will be playing an Indian.  An Indian?  Yeah.  I'm going to be an Indian because I was out of D in once.  Save it for the show.  I could do it twice.  I'm going to hate Chip.  I hate Chip.  The pilgrims.  I'm going to hate him.  Two pilgrims. 
[02:20:00]  Two pilgrims.  To be played by Stalker Patty and Mr. Anthony Cumia.  Where's the cornucopia?  That was Anthony.  And, of course, I need some alcohol.  One more roll.  That's the centerpiece of everything.  The turkey on the first Thanksgiving to be played by Mr. Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel.  The sex man himself.  Yes.  Sex man. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  Iroch actually agreed to this.  That's awesome.  Of course he did.  Yes, he did.  That's awesome.  What?  No, Iroch just found out about this.  Oops, I forgot.  Planned weeks ago.  I was sure somebody would have mentioned it.  That's weird that you didn't find out about it until today, live on the air.  Oh, well.  I dropped the ball.  Yeah, because we got the costumes and everything.  So, outfits.  We got the outfits and everything.  You got some costumes.  That sounds like a fun time.  And me and Ope are going to do foley work. 
[02:21:00]  That's right.  And I'm going to have...  Do I get a rogue cop scene?  And we're going to have to, like, kind of...  We might be able to write you in a rogue cop scene.  Well, there could be pilgrim cops that come in.  Yeah, I come in and go, dude!  And we're going to have to comment on the action just for the radio audience.  Yeah.  So, we got a job, Bobby.  Me and you got a job.  Big job.  You got a script.  It's good.  Bring your box of props for the foley work.  I got my box of props.  You know what?  You bring your peace pipe, dude.  You sit down.  You have some turkeys and stuff.  You know what, dude?  All right.  We slaughtered you.  Hey, old Bob Kelly walking down the hall, by the way. 
[02:21:30]  Start going to the gym, Bobby.  I'm going to.  Oh, no.  It was a fat bald man.  It's not good.  That's you in 15 years, Bobby.  This whole skit is going down at the heart of that guy.  Future Bob Kelly.  Of course it's that guy.  I'm sorry.  Jesus Christ.  He has no idea.  We were just beating him up.  Hey, we're going to lose Bobby in a few minutes, and I really want to do one more thing with  Bobby here, because you're a comic, Bobby.  Yes.  And Jim Norton is a comic.  And we had a big scene that went down on The View yesterday, and I want to get your opinion 
[02:22:00]  on the whole fucking thing.  Two people I hate a lot.  You got Jim Norton and Bob Kelly.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yeah, really?  She's a duster.  Fucking hate her.  Good to look at and all, yes, but fucking hate her.  Easy on the eyes, hard on the ears.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  And on the other side would be Bill Maher, who I fucking hate.  Really?  You don't like Bill Maher.  Why?  I just fucking hate him.  His fucking pompous asshole attitude.  I would enjoy him more if he fucking got rid of half his shit. 
[02:22:30]  He's actually a big fan of the show.  He's a big fan of you, too.  Bullshit.  Swear to God, he's a big fan.  Then why didn't he come in for a religious?  I was just saying that.  Exactly.  It would have changed.  I would probably agree with Bill Maher on a lot of things, but I don't fucking like  his attitude.  I like people who like me.  Huh?  That's why you're getting shit and I'm not, because I fucking, I gotta shut my fucking  mouth.  I like people who like me, Ope.  Bill Maher likes you.  I would imagine he would. 
[02:23:00]  Anyway, they went at it, and in all fairness, Bill Maher was in the right.  Let's find out.  He was absolutely in the fucking right.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck had basically a big, huge stick up her twat yesterday.  Ew.  Couldn't wait for Bill Maher to hit the set.  They started the interview, and then she quickly had to change the whole fucking vibe  because she had something on her mind.  Something he said, I don't know, a couple months ago. 
[02:23:30]  This is how it went down.  Listen closely.  Man, I couldn't.  Hi, guys.  Hi, ladies.  What a great day for me to be here when a Republican makes a fool of himself like that.  It happens every day, though.  Well, let's start with somebody who's neither Republican.  Sorry.  You can apologize in a couple minutes.  We'll get in there.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  When Sandusky is neither Republican nor Democrat, he's just a pervert.  So what do you say about that?  Well, you know, you'd like this because I said on my show Friday night that any institution 
[02:24:00]  where there's no women around, like the church, like football, like the Middle East, like fraternities,  it just goes to hell.  Why is it bad?  Well, you do need women as a moderating influence.  I mean, when men are just among men, they just do stupid things.  That's really true.  I have a question.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Is Penn State, why is he, oh, good, it's football.  He's not saying at school.  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, basically when guys are hanging out, they're going to do stupid shit together.  Like touch kids? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  What?  It's a bit of a stretch.  Well, sometimes.  And Sandusky's lawyer yesterday drove me nuts, basically saying, yeah, jocks shower all the time together.  Yeah.  They do, though.  They do, though.  Well, they know I'm not in a way fucking Sandusky.  Sometimes if you're at an away game, all of a sudden the showers are a little weird.  It's one big room with a lot of shower heads, but they're not in a stall to fucking gather fucking each other.  Wait, was Sandusky in a stall?  I don't know.  Oh, I thought it was a big shower.  No, I thought it was.  Well.  I mean, you touch your leg or something. 
[02:25:00]  Well, if there was plenty of room in the shower, you know.  Sometimes it's not.  Why was he fucking the boy?  Back in the day, people were smaller.  They made the shower heads closer.  Now we're bigger, so you're next to each other.  You might bump ass cheeks or cocks.  Tummy to tummy, tip to tip.  That's how we used to shower in my family.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Tip to tip.  Tummy to tummy, tip to tip.  That's how you shower.  Jesus.  That's how a couple of men get clean.  Yeah, that's how you get clean.  Tummy to tummy, tip to tip, folks.  We should try it.  A couple of men.  Try it in a...  That's all right.  Let's do it in a tub.  Let's do it under a waterfall. 
[02:25:30]  Tummy to tummy, tip to tip.  That's right.  A couple of men getting clean the way men should.  Helmet to helmet.  Yeah.  A couple of men soaping up like men do.  Walking?  Yeah.  Do we talk?  No, we just put our belly buttons together, the tips of our penises, and we soak each  other up individually.  Yeah, especially when you get really tender up on the chest and nipple area.  Yeah.  Hum a song, like a limerick.  Maybe sing this song.  Whistle this song.  And nobody even notices when the one hand slips down and begins tugging that cock, which 
[02:26:00]  has just jumped up to say hello.  Wow.  Oh, sorry.  Just speculating.  Let's hit this.  Because I hear, I see, I hear different things come out of you sometimes, because that sounded  very supportive of women.  And I just want to go back to a time that actually bothered me just for, not my own personal  reasons, but just for women.  We're into it already.  Yeah.  Pause, pause, pause, pause.  Forgive this idiotic Republican for bringing that up. 
[02:26:30]  Pause.  She goes, it bothered me not for personal reasons?  Listen to the fuck.  It was completely because of personal reasons.  No, she's already being passive aggressive anyway.  Of course she is.  Wait till you hear.  And she's trying to say it didn't bother her personally.  It just bothered her in general as far as women go.  But it didn't bother her.  Wait till you hear what this is all about.  There's nothing more psychotic than passive aggressive people, though.  Passive aggressive people suck.  They're the craziest people on the planet.  So forgive this idiotic Republican for bringing this to your brilliant mind. 
[02:27:00]  But in February of last year, Laura Logan, as you recall, was in Egypt, and she was brutally  attacked by a mob there.  She came back and said, their hands raping me over and over again, tearing my body in  every direction, trying to tear off chunks of my skull.  I was in no doubt in the process of dying.  Now, prior to her coming back, Bill, you on your show said, now that Mubarak has released  Laura Logan, he must put her intrepid hotness on a plane immediately. 
[02:27:30]  In exchange, we will send Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  She's bothered by that personally.  Of course she is.  And it's a joke.  But she said she wasn't.  So that's her first fucking lie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What a baby she is.  What a fucking baby.  And you know what?  It is a joke.  Of course it is.  And it's a funny joke.  Might not be your type of humor, but it's a fucking edgy joke.  But you see the key words she's thrown in there, the rape and all this.  She's trying to get women to hear those words and be like, what the fuck? 
[02:28:00]  Fuck him.  Out of context.  She's putting this whole thing.  She's using the key words and she's being passive aggressive so that people don't see  her being angry.  Because if she comes off angry and is a cunt, people won't like her.  If she's like, look, no, it's not personal.  But you said this and that and it touched my body.  And then you put my name in.  I don't get it.  And then what happens is this, if you go, I was joking, she goes, that's a joke.  Rape is a joke.  You can't win that argument.  I haven't seen the clip.  No, I'm not.  Well, you're nailing it.  But no, rape isn't funny. 
[02:28:30]  That's not funny what happened to her.  Fuck Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  And Bill Maher picked her for the joke because she's very hateable.  And she's a Republican.  So that's what makes that joke work.  Who plays that role.  And she's a Republican.  Exactly.  Right.  So it's a perfect fucking person to come up with for this particular joke.  But if Bill Maher had said that, meaning it, like if he had said, you know what, folks,  all kidding aside, Elizabeth Hasselbeck should be brought to the Middle East and raped.  People would go, what the fuck are you talking about?  Nobody.  Comedians wouldn't laugh at that.  Right.  But that's not what a joke is.  Right.  So when people take jokes literally on purpose so they can be offended. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  They're full of shit.  Yeah.  How she read that joke.  It's a tough one to defend because she's just reading it.  She's an idiot.  It's happening to comics so much more.  They're being taken literal.  What we're saying.  It's it's it's getting scary.  Well, that's because guys keep people keep apologizing.  And they that's why I love fucking Cat Williams because he was fucking stupid.  Publicist put out a statement, but then he came out and said, I'm not sorry I said that.  I ain't sorry for shit.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  I'm trying to tear off chunks of my skull.  I was in no doubt in the process of dying.  Now, prior to her coming back, Bill, you on your show said now that Mubarak has released 
[02:29:30]  Laura Logan, he must put her intrepid hotness on a plane immediately.  In exchange, we will send Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Now, that's fine if you want to laugh.  People laugh.  I make it my job and profession.  I sit with incredible comedians and the best in the business in terms of broadcasting.  You can't sit here right now and tell me I'm wrong for saying that wasn't that funny.  Pause.  Yeah.  To you.  It is funny.  To you.  Her audience laughed it right then. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Fucked up your whole point.  People just went.  It's a joke.  When someone says, that's just not funny, it's like, that's what humor is, you dumb broad.  Right.  It's taking things that aren't funny and making them so people can laugh at them.  That's what I hate.  Do people need the wall broken?  That's what humor does.  It kind of knocks down these things which are big and horrible and makes them manageable.  She's a fucking dope.  She could say it wasn't funny to me.  That is more than fair.  Of course.  You can't say it's not funny for everybody. 
[02:30:30]  And here's the thing.  That's ridiculous.  He's on HBO and he's a millionaire.  He can say whatever the fuck he wants and do whatever he wants and be funny with no restrictions.  And that's how he chooses to be funny.  Right.  So go fuck yourself.  But here, she set him up and this whole crew set him up.  Because unless they, I don't know, maybe they're individually, she has a piece of paper  she's reading from.  She didn't tell anybody else she was going to do this.  They like controversy on the show.  They're not stupid.  They know what is going to get people talking about.  If you watch it closely, they all knew what she was going to do. 
[02:31:00]  Sure.  Because at one point I think someone even said, oh boy, because she hinted that she was going  to get to something.  But you can't tell the rest of us what's funny.  That is so stupid in your thinking.  What is his defense?  He's going to say I was joking.  I'm curious to how she handles his defense.  Well, you know, we do a comedy show for an audience that's perhaps different.  Thank you very much.  But perhaps different than your audience.  And, you know, I mean, you are a public figure.  It was not aimed at you personally, but when you are a public figure, you're out there 
[02:31:30]  and you're fodder for comedians to make comments on.  Do you draw the line ever?  I mean, there's nothing in you.  I do draw the line, but I also live on the line.  You know, I do a different kind of show.  I'm on HBO.  That's my stock and trade.  Joy has also said as a comedian that we walk the ledge.  You know, it's not easy.  It's like you make a joke.  Sometimes people's feelings get hurt.  And that's why I love Joy Behar.  She always defends comedians. 
[02:32:00]  Otto just walked in.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, Otto.  We're watching a clip on The View where Bill Maher made a joke about Elizabeth Hasselbeck  and she's annoyed.  But fucking Joy Behar always sticks up for comedians because she's a real stand-up.  But, I mean, she's annoyed because the joke was about her.  But her mistake is basically saying that it's not funny and no one should think this is funny  instead of saying it wasn't funny to me.  If I was at home and this show was on TV and I couldn't find a clicker and it was a  handgun on the coffee table, I'd fucking use that on myself rather than watch this show.  Are you kidding me?  Is this what you're fucking doing when Anthony's not here? 
[02:32:30]  He's just showing this shit.  That's funny, Otto.  All right.  I'm sorry.  It's a viral clip, all right?  He's just kidding.  Don't be so sensitive, man.  I just had a rough experience getting up here, man.  What happened to you?  Just trying to swipe that fucking subway thing, man.  It says unacceptable C attendant and it was like 18 people in line to see this fucking  silverback in the fucking booth there.  You know, and then I go re-fucking-charge. 
[02:33:00]  The, the, the, I'm just not used to this, this happy commute that everybody goes about  their day doing their little swipes and get, you know, it just rejected me.  It sends, sends a nervousness or something.  Yeah.  It's just fucking horrible.  Did you wipe it on your, your pants?  No, it's a big card.  It's got $20 on it.  It's just fucking horrible getting up here.  I just really appreciate being a comic that I don't have to go on with this commute every  day.  Right.  It's horrible.  I figured that whenever I'm in traffic, it's like, you, how do people do this five days  a week?  Yeah.  Fucking, I don't know how they do it. 
[02:33:30]  It's how do you not just snap and murder people on the highway?  Yeah.  That Colin Ferguson guy.  I fucking, there should be 10 of those a day.  You know, I don't understand how people don't just freak out at them.  You know, they're miserable lives.  They're ineffectual, dumb lives.  Tell us how you really feel.  Yeah.  Fucking chip.  Let's see what Bill Maher said.  And I like George.  Would you say that again, knowing what you know?  What you, what you have to, what you have to know is that somebody has to be out on  the edge to know where the edge is.  Oh, thanks for being the hero, I guess.  But I'm just saying, would you say that again? 
[02:34:00]  I just wanted to say pause that.  Go ahead.  Would you say that again?  You know what?  Would you use that same trade of women, say, if you're so supportive of women.  If I had crossed the wall and knew I was coming here and had to like spend my whole segment  talking about it, no, I wouldn't.  No, you don't.  It really wouldn't.  It really wouldn't be worth it.  Listen, I went through years of, you know, worse things have happened to people.  I went through years of, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I survived.  And my feelings weren't hurt.  I'm speaking on behalf of women. 
[02:34:30]  Hold on, what a fucking liar piece of shit.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Fucking passive aggressive.  What a phony bitch.  She was completely bothered.  Yes.  And none of the women there are defending her.  Right.  None of them.  Nobody, they never defend this psycho.  She's a passive aggressive fucking lunatic.  But that's why she's on the show.  The only reason why she's on the show is because she's got a pretty face.  What fucking talent does she have?  And they sort of try to balance it out politically.  But what talent did she have to get the job?  A pretty face.  That's it.  She ate bugs on Survivor. 
[02:35:00]  That's how we all got to know her.  The only reason you're here is because you're fucking pretty.  You elitist, never been told to shut the fuck up, twat.  But to break it down, it's fine if she's bothered by the joke.  That's why I love fat chicks.  They're happy and they have low self-esteem.  The whole world knows that.  Nice people.  The whole world knows she was bothered by the joke.  And she's going to go on her own fucking show with these hens and say she wasn't bothered?  That's bullshit.  Yeah, she's bothered.  Of course she is.  If she went out, you know what, you really offended me with what you said.  That hurt my feelings and I didn't like being. 
[02:35:30]  He would have went, hey, I'm sorry, I fucked up.  But the passive-aggressive way she's doing this is fucking just, it angers me so bad.  I fucking hate passive-aggressive people.  That's why she's there.  Her role, and this is where kind of like they give conservative women a hard time to be the dumb conservative lady.  She's hot.  I was looking for roles.  I got hungry.  I know.  I have roles.  I'll keep going.  I think that was good.  But that's why she's there.  She's the dumb conservative. 
[02:36:00]  Ann Coulter, if they put her in that spot, people love her or hate her, she's not dumb and she's not hypersensitive, would play what she does completely differently.  Of course.  So they don't put her there.  Hopi, what's with the beard, man?  Isn't that a little frightening for the baby?  Your boy is charming.  He's trying to have this grizzled fucking...  I look scary?  Yeah, it's not...  I don't know.  It doesn't seem to be you.  I've never seen you with the...  Whiskey poos.  I'm just fucking growing a beard.  Yeah, for the winter.  Winter coat. 
[02:36:30]  It's all right.  It'll probably be shaved by the weekend.  It'll be all right.  Don't shave it.  I like it.  You like it, Bobby?  Let it grow.  You gotta let it grow out.  It's weird.  It looks good on you.  And wear those fucking flannels.  I'm gonna fucking have you come in with a thing of paper towels.  I was just gonna say that.  God damn you.  Fuck you too.  I wanted to say it.  Well, I said it.  Well, you didn't say brawny.  Fuck.  Well, I always said it without saying it.  Fuck dick.  Fuck.  Fuck.  It's a brawny look?  Yeah.  No.  No.  The shirt is gonna be in the garden.  You leave it.  You have to wear it.  It's a brawny look. 
[02:37:00]  First of all, the shirt looks great.  It goes with your skin.  It's a fucking brawny look.  Oh.  The combo, though, with the beard and the shirt.  Did you just poop?  No.  Are you sure?  No, I didn't.  You sure?  I'm sure I didn't.  You know, my ass...  It just felt like a zit popped in my asshole.  Move your ass back and forth from left to right.  Nope.  Didn't do it.  You sure?  Wow.  Nope.  But I like the look.  Grow the beard out.  It looks good.  It's a new look for you, and you should grow it.  Stop shaving your face.  Grow a beard.  Cover some of that.  I want Jimmy to fucking grow it, too. 
[02:37:30]  You look good in a beard.  He wouldn't look good in a beard.  Jimmy would look good in a beard.  No, he looks good with a beard.  He doesn't...  Ew.  You know, get it like a gay guy.  That is...  I don't know why I didn't laugh at that, because it was funny.  It was a funny joke.  But I was too busy thinking of how bad I look in a real beard.  Have you ever grown a beard?  Um, yeah, but it just kind of comes...  I look like a child with a fake beard tape to me.  Did you trim it or just grow the fucking...  Can I just grow it?  No, I didn't trim it.  Yeah, it was kind of like Ted Kaczynski.  You know what he looks like when he grows a beard?  A pug. 
[02:38:00]  Really?  That's fucking funny, man.  That's so wrong.  That's good.  You were good in Men in Black.  I love that.  Jimmy should get a pug.  You do.  You look like a fucking pug.  You know how the owners look like their dogs?  Did you put a pug?  Can we get to the end of this clip?  Can we please just show a pug?  I want to see...  Yeah, no problem.  I want Jimmy to see what he looks like as a dog when he grows a beard.  Let's just look at a pug.  When you were saying, type it in, Sam!  I gotta leave the clip out first.  Type the fucking pug in. 
[02:38:30]  B-U-G.  We don't do view clips often.  This one is like a biggie, because it's a comic thing.  Oh, Jim?  Gilmar's getting attacked for a joke he did, and it's just not right.  Yeah, by a woman deciding what's funny for everybody, and that drives us nuts on this fucking  radio show.  But I love the fact that Barbara Walters and Joy Behar are leaving her hanging.  I love the fact they're leaving her hanging.  They are.  She's delusional.  Pug!  You want pug, or the last ten seconds of the pug? 
[02:39:00]  Let's do the ten seconds of the pug, and then we go pug.  And then we go pug.  All right, then when you hit me in the headphone.  I went through years of wah-wah-wah-wah.  I survived.  My feelings weren't hurt.  I'm speaking on behalf of women.  We don't trade.  Women in this country shouldn't be a global issue.  And quite frankly, I know it's funny.  I work with funnies.  That wasn't funny.  Can we move on?  Did you see what you just did?  It was so great to be here on The View and to talk with all of you, or one of you.  Well, you can talk about me, or you can talk to me.  I think accountability is sometimes important in life. 
[02:39:30]  That's what I teach my kids.  We can go on now.  What else do you feel about the world?  Okay.  Hello.  Welcome to The View.  I think I'm being very well-behaved.  Let me say something.  When she was hurt, we'd love her, and she said her job to expect...  I want to hurt.  You can't hurt me.  I said that before.  I have a question.  Oh, you got a question?  You sound like you're hurt.  No, I'm not, Billy.  She was hurt.  No, you are hurt, Elizabeth.  And you know what?  I'm not, Billy.  Bull fucking shit.  You know what a comic's going to...  Someone's going to have to go, fuck you.  Someone like him is going to have to go, enough, you fucking idiots. 
[02:40:00]  No.  She does it to herself.  They left her hanging.  That clip, how you're reacting, is how 90% of the people who see it will react.  Yeah.  And the beard would make it look perfect.  I get it.  I so get it, Bobby.  I'm a $50 writer.  I got a six-pack in it.  I guess I'm going to loosen up my guests.  I didn't know you were listening.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Same brown eyes, too. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, I got to get the beard.  Get the chin in.  I need the chin.  Oh, my God.  It's adorable.  It is cute, though.  You're a cute dog.  Don't ask me to pose so you can do like a before and after shot.  I didn't even say a word to you.  You did turn toward his camera.  Jimmy knows when the cameras are on.  I do.  That's a good-looking pose.  That's because he's a press hound.  That's a cute dog.  Look at that little eyes on that thing.  And Whoopi just sits there.  What the fuck's that about?  You're a comic.  You know a little bit about this shit. 
[02:41:00]  She's fucking farting.  She's farting and stoned.  She's weird.  Whoopi defends guys sometimes that she should and other times doesn't.  She's kind of weird.  You don't know where she's going to go, usually.  What a shit show.  Language.  Sorry.  But it's smart, though, because they get that reaction.  If it was just purely logical, people wouldn't watch it.  People wouldn't get angry at it or talk about it.  Like, oh, yeah, they all made some sense.  But she actually said she was saying all the key words to make women.  Sure.  It's not for me.  It's for women around.  She sucks.  But Sherry Shepard also sucks. 
[02:41:30]  Fucking asshole.  And so does Star Jones.  They always have somebody who really sucks.  It's a smart mix of fucking people because they get reactions out of people.  You don't want to see five logical women discussing something because then you wouldn't have any  reaction to it.  And you got Sherry Shepard who thinks that fucking Earth is flying.  There's got to be some static and opposing view, for sure.  Everybody agreeing it would be the worst half hour.  It's got to be a little electricity.  Yeah.  Conflict.  Conflict.  That was electricity.  We have to take a break.  When is your show premiere?  My show?  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  The Pig Roast?  Yes, sir.  On www.pigroast.tv?  That one?  Yes.  November 22nd.  November 22nd.  That's just a coincidence about the Kennedy assassination.  I'm a big Kennedy buff.  Was that the 22nd?  I didn't know he was shot in the 22nd.  Yeah, there's no way to attribute a slain president better than a no-talent ventriloquist  with a shitty production value in Hoboken.  Fucking Otto.  The production value is terrific.  You should dig up Kennedy and just give him a eye poke to see what condition he's in now. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, well, any of them.  Get three shovels.  The different degrees of dead.  There's four shovels.  Yeah, there's a lot of dead Kennedy.  Yeah, there sure are.  They're a good band.  We got a break just because of live read purposes.  All right.  I'm out of here, too.  I got to go.  I got to get my heart checked out.  And then you're going to lift cabinets, I hear.  That's so dumb.  I got to meet her at...  Why would you do that?  He's going to go watch Little Nicky.  No, he's worried about his heart, so he's getting his heart checked out, but you're not 
[02:43:00]  going to get the results.  And then right after the heart exam, he's going to go lift cabinets.  You're going to get a chest x-ray, like a whole thing?  I'm going to get...  No, I'm getting a stress test.  Oh.  And then I'm getting my heart...  An EKG.  I'm getting my heart checked because I had a pain in my chest the other day.  After doing anything in particular?  Breathing and drinking a soda.  Really?  Yeah.  I was just sitting there.  It might be heartburn from this soda, man.  Actually, we were in a heated debate.  You're getting a panic attack.  We were kind of a heated...  I've started getting panic attacks, too, since I quit smoking.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I never had one in my life.  Now I'm getting panic attacks.  Well, like...  Because, you know, we go on the road.  I start having to pack the night before.  And I start...  Where's my Q-tips?  Where's my...  Really?  And all of a sudden, I start panicking.  Why are you someone to do that?  And I hit my wife.  I smack her right in the chin.  Oh, fuck.  Where's the fucking Q-tips?  You'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  I really do get panic attacks now, now that I quit smoking.  It is, yeah?  Yeah.  It's three months, and I'm...  That's...  I used to smoke a bud.  I'd go have a cup of coffee before...  List more things. 
[02:44:00]  Smoke before a show, after a show.  You're panicking right now.  Sometimes before an audition.  I'd get on this show.  I'd have a cigarette on the...  Keep going.  I smoke to live and live to smoke.  Back after this.  All right.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  The following sexually explicit CB radio transmission took place one evening in early 2010 between radio personalities Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.  Neither party has been made aware of its existence until now.  I'm thinking about you.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Did you get the video I sent?  Yeah.  I really do want to be rough with you.  Wow.  Well, what do you want to do?  What are you going to do to wear me out?  I want to treat you rough.  Throw you around.  Spank and slap you.  Slap your face.  Yeah.  Treat you like a dirty little whore.  Put my cock in your ass and then shove it down your throat.  I want you to bite me.  Now you're talking.  Then I'm going to tell you to shut the fuck up while I slap your face and pull your hair for making noise. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  I want you to beg for my cock.  Yeah.  Kiss you all over to convince me to let you have it in your mouth.  We will see how bad you want me.  Whatever else turns you on.  Whatever I want, you are mine.  You please me like no other has or ever will.  I'm not losing that.  Great thing is we have a lifetime of this.  Okay.  Lights out.  Good night, sexy. 
[02:45:30]  SiriusXM.  SiriusXM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got Bob Kelly and Otto from Otto and George.  Let's not forget about the Pig Roast.  Starts this coming Tuesday, November 22nd on Pig Roast TV.  PigRoast.tv.  What was that?  PigRoast.tv.  Jimmy Norton's birthday was the first show we're going to air, so that will be a good one to kick it off with. 
[02:46:00]  Nice.  Oh, the first one?  No, we're showing them out of order because we figured you were the biggest name that we had.  I didn't think I was very good, though.  You were funny.  I didn't think I was very funny.  Well, I mean, what can you do?  There was nothing to do.  You're just being interviewed.  Comedians aren't good interviews and actors aren't good interviews.  We're trying to get more mentally ill people.  They make the best interviews.  There's nothing worse than hearing an actor or a comedian talk about their craft and shops and all that shit. 
[02:46:30]  It's terrible.  I don't want to hear about your struggles.  Because there are no struggles.  We're spoiled babies.  I think a lot of people are going to check out PigRoast.com this coming Tuesday.  Yeah, I don't know how the internet goes, you know, how it's going to spread virally, but I just think people will just talk about it.  You know, I fucking worked really hard on this thing.  Well, I mean, you know, there's probably clips within the show that could go viral, too, for you.  You know what I mean?  We had some crazy shit that happened. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, definitely.  Who's on the hotline?  Hello?  You know what, dude?  You get your EKG.  You get a cup of coffee.  You know what, dude?  He's trying to figure out who he is.  He's doing you.  No, I know.  Yeah, I don't know much about the internet, you fucking half-danish, too-junkie.  I don't call on it.  I figured I had to work on phone, because I finally got and tied myself. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, it's Jay.  How are you, boys?  Hi, Jay.  I'm excited about...  First of all, Bobby Kelly's broken the top 40 on his fucking podcast.  You know what, dude?  Kudos to Bobby.  And, Jay, your podcast is fucking great, too, by the way.  More stories.  Mine was number one until I got Colin on, and then it fucking debuted at number 10, 
[02:48:00]  because it's anti-American, that fucking asshole.  He fucked up your fucking ranking.  I was number one, like, 11 weeks in a row, you know, top five,  and then I get Colin on, and I just barely creep in with fucking Doug Loves movies,  as usually I have.  Is that some podcast humor?  Dude, he's just funny.  I love it.  Well, Jimmy, first of all, we talk about Otto and George for a good 10 minutes.  Yeah, thanks.  I heard that for your kind words, Jay.  Thank you.  It's idolatry, and we break down the psychosis and the genius of what it takes for Otto for when George makes fun of an audience member, 
[02:48:30]  the psychosis that has to go into the transaction of thought.  Like, fucking Otto has to spot the person and then do, like, fucking two bits.  And then the fucking puppet looks over, like, he's just fucking discovering it for the first, look at this fucking cocksuck over here.  Creating the illusion, yeah.  Oh, my God, it's fascinating. 
[02:49:00]  And it's great.  And we were in hysterics.  Like, the podcast closes with, like, 11 minutes of Otto ball watching.  But fucking Colin fucked it up for you.  Yeah.  You know, but this might save it.  Yeah.  There's something on the podcast that the pests might love.  And, you know, I don't make any money.  I don't have any fucking sponsors or do fleshlight or anything.  So it's not for that reason, but it is truly because people will like it, I think, is I do a Chip Chipperson impression. 
[02:49:30]  What's that?  It's, like, 45 minutes in.  And Colin, somebody put it up on Twitter, and I retweeted it, but I don't know where it is.  So whoever is listening that puts that, if anybody can isolate the 30 seconds of audio, I do Chip, and Colin literally makes an exclamation like he's having a heart attack.  Jesus.  I don't want to hear this.  We're talking about Genesis.  I asked him what his favorite book of the Bible was, and he says Revelations, and I make fun of him. 
[02:50:00]  Like, that's, what are you fucking, Jerry Bruckheimer, like crabs crawling out of the ocean, you hack?  He's like, well, what do you want from me?  What's your favorite book of the Bible?  And then, anyway, we started talking about Genesis and Sodom and Gomorrah, and I go, he said, you know, the poor guy's wife turned us off, you know, what are you supposed to do?  And I go, she was a real salty broad or something.  And he goes, oh, and he actually fucking clapped his chest. 
[02:50:30]  And it wasn't like, he didn't plan it out, like, if Jay does Chip, I'll fucking do this.  Like, it was a visceral fucking grab, oh, and he grabbed his chest.  Yeah, but it doesn't make sense, because you didn't do, I would have done a joke good, like, if you said something about the ladies made of salt, I would have said, why don't you throw her on some eggs or something?  Oh, I fucking hate, I fucking hate him.  And then Colin goes into, wait, Opie, you hate Chip?  No, I hate Chip.  Uh, I like Chip. 
[02:51:00]  You don't like Chip.  I play the role of hating him on the show.  And then Colin goes into, like, this incredible detailed explanation of Chip when he shows up at the Comedy Cellar, makes his jokes, but if you look at him, you can see the fucking hatred in Chip's eyes.  Like, and I wanted to say to Colin, like, you know that's Jimmy, right?  Oh, you have Jay's Chip impression?  Yes, I do.  Oh, fuck, I, okay, good.  I want to talk about the pig roast.  Why doesn't he go to a fucking blockbuster and stand next to Suicide Kings and try to get spotted? 
[02:51:30]  I want to talk about the fucking pig roast.  He's established, this asshole.  He's got to call in and talk for fucking 40 minutes now?  Every fucking time.  As fucking attention does he need?  Jerk off.  Back to your little fucking man cave, go fuck yourself.  Talk about my pig roast.  What's that, what's that, a dinner or something?  See, I make it all better.  Chip, shut up, Chip.  Oh my God, this is...  Hey, Bobby, still there?  Yes, he is.  I have to go, I have a heart exam at 940. 
[02:52:00]  I have a heart attack already.  They want to spend a weekend over here, he's touching everything.  I know you're a golf scorer.  They want to spend a weekend near Langford.  King of comedy.  Yeah.  I'm in.  You're out.  You didn't know.  When Bobby explained packing the night before a flight, he said...  Wait, Jay's just going to move on from the auto thing.  We're so dysfunctional on this show.  Huh?  We're dysfunctional on this show.  No, Bobby goes, you know, when I get a pack for a gig, I'm like, where are my Q-tips? 
[02:52:30]  That was the first thing that rolled out of Bobby's mouth.  Where are my Q...  When he's got his luggage out, where are my Q-tips?  I got to have my Q-tips.  Cleaning my ears is one of my favorite things to do.  Oh, my God.  Don't break my balls, Otto.  You was my number eight pick in my fantasy comedy draft on Twitter.  Oh, yeah?  What does that mean?  It means that there was a draft and you was drafty.  I don't know.  Oh, like a football analogy?  Oh, well.  All right.  Guess.  What is it?  Was it cold in here or something?  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Drafty.  What are you, a towel or something?  Otto wants to talk about the pig roast.  Yeah, I want to talk about the pig roast, too.  I think it's a great idea.  What the fuck is going on?  I got to go.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Why are you leaving?  I got my heart thing.  Otto, why don't you say a few nice things about the pig roast first?  Don't cut out.  First of all, I fucking watched the pig roast.  I talked to you about the pig roast.  Yeah, we had a good talk.  I think it's fucking, it's very funny.  It's fucking, it's kind of fucking, there's a lot of hot chicks on it.  And I think it's fucking hilarious.  You should go check out the pig roast. 
[02:53:30]  What's the name of the website again?  www.pigroast.tv.  .tv.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I'm a talentless host, but that seems to be what works on television.  Minimal amount of talent and just bring good guests on.  You know, the show is as good and bad as my guests.  And tits.  There's always tits.  I learned that from Benny Hill.  Right.  Shove a hot ass into the camera.  Benny Hill.  Yeah, I mean.  It's true.  How can you go wrong?  Never show tits, but have the illusion that a tit might pop out.  Fast motion tits?  Yeah.  You going fast motion tits like Benny Hill used to? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's a good idea.  In high heels, why the fuck not?  Yeah.  Let's do fast motion boobies.  And do slow motion assholes.  Slow motion assholes.  What a fucking concept.  Yeah, there you go.  Fast motion titties.  Yeah.  You're nervous about this one, aren't you?  The pig roast.  You're a little nervous.  Hey, Otto, will you tweet me the link?  And then I'll retweet the link and tell everybody to go watch the pig.  Well, I'll tweet it.  Yeah.  Tweet?  Okay.  Sure.  I don't know nothing about computers.  I don't.  I had sold.  Look at me. 
[02:54:30]  I got a fucking mullet.  I saw the clip.  Do you see the clip of us at the Orlando Improv?  Look at his fucking true cut, this fucking faggot.  What the fuck?  Lonely, lonely man.  Bobby Kelly.  Look at Bobby here.  No one's picking up on it.  We got the chip clip.  This is fucking a lint.  I got to hear the chip clip before I leave.  You sure, Bobby?  I fucking hate chip.  Because you got to lift cabinets today.  I got to hear the chip clip. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Can we hear the chip clip?  You're perfectly round human.  All right.  This is more stories.  Episode 19.  Chip shows up in the podcast.  So this is isolated from the podcast.  Hit it.  Unless laid down with him.  It's kind of hot, I guess.  But it's pretty sick.  I mean, literally hot.  Because it's on fire around them.  I don't know what you're thinking.  I like the quality of your podcast, Joe.  Do you record it in a conch shell? 
[02:55:30]  What the fuck?  Hey, Opie.  Why don't you talk to your friend Kevin Smith about the whole New York podcast?  Well, what the fuck is going on with the fucking sound of the Jay Moore podcast?  You deserve better than that, sir.  People showed up in my hotel room, dropped mics on the table, said, here's your library.  Oh.  All right.  That's fair enough.  He should have gave you some unis.  Yeah.  And instead you have omnis.  Yeah.  Yep.  It sounds like you're doing a podcast underwater.  Or in the shower. 
[02:56:00]  Or on a conch shell.  Yeah.  Or on a conch shell.  Or on a raft.  Jay Moore deserves better.  He was the number one podcast.  Yeah, in a bat cave.  All right.  We'll try to.  We'll try to.  I know why that sounds crappy.  And it might not be him.  It's the.  He saved it in a lower quality MP3 file.  Bob Kelly can take care of you.  So it doesn't sound like it's underwater.  But besides that, we'll make believe it's not underwater.  And we'll listen for the quality of the comedy.  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Been literally hot because it's on fire around them. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know what you're thinking.  I know it's hot to sleep with your brother.  Yeah, because the wife is a pillow of salt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, she's a salty brother.  Yeah.  That's something Chip Chipper said.  You clutched your heart.  Chip Chipper said.  Like the guy in the big picture.  Yeah.  You just clutched your heart.  How old are these people?  Early 40s.  Oh, Chip Chipper said.  Oh.  She's a real salty brother.  Something wrong.  With those angry eyes over his childhood trauma with his mother. 
[02:57:00]  He's like, he just looks at you like this at the cellar.  Who, Jimmy?  Yeah, Chip.  Chip.  Oh, yeah.  He looks at you like this.  He's trying to be funny, but his eyes are so angry.  It's really sick.  Oh, evil.  How do we like Matthew?  Bunch of bullshit.  What are you, roasting pigs or something?  Chip does get mad once in a while at you.  I don't like being made fun of.  What?  I like how I go, who, Jimmy?  And Connelly goes, no, Chip.  I like that he has a backstory for Chip. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Pig roast.  The pig roast.  Yeah, Jay.  This is pig roast time.  What's the address for that, Otto?  We don't want to get yelled at.  So, you know, this is pig roast time, Jay.  Why don't you have me on your pig roast or something?  Then I'll really make it.  You'll be on Chip.  Don't touch me.  You're very funny.  See, he gets angry.  You've got to be careful.  Where are the eyes bug out?  I was on that Teletubby that was called.  Tony the Cuntlapper.  Wait, did you produce it with my check?  It's a fucking pig roast, you fucking half-spoke. 
[02:58:00]  Jay, would you do the pig roast?  Of course I would.  Why don't you have Jay on when you guys are doing it?  Is he done taping?  Otto, would you have Jay on?  Well, we tape in New York.  That's the only problem.  I mean, it's hard getting guests in New York.  Yeah, Jay doesn't come to New York.  Too bad you can't tape.  Too bad he doesn't come to New York, Austin.  See if Fez will let you get Ron Bennington on.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Don't we dare.  Fez is supposedly making us Thanksgiving dinner on Friday, I'm hearing.  I am excited about the pig roast.  Please tweet me, Otto, so I can retweet it. 
[02:58:30]  That would be great.  Yeah, I need help.  I need fucking...  And Otto, we're helping you.  We're going to go with fast motion tits and slow motion assholes.  Or at least slow motion asses bouncing up and down a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit, a little jiggle.  A little apple ball.  They do that slow motion.  You're going to fucking see the numbers go up.  What else can we give Otto today?  I tried to get one of the piglets on today.  I got in touch with Travis, and he said he would ask...  Did he ask you guys about...  No.  I couldn't understand why he didn't immediately say, 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, bring her.  Because she was going to come up here, dress like a whore,  and you guys could just look at her.  Can we throw stuff at her?  Whatever, yeah.  No.  Can we throw bacon at her?  No.  Yeah.  I wanted to bring her up.  I was thinking staplers.  I was thinking raw bacon.  Raw bacon.  Yeah, so it sticks to her.  I just want to look at her pussy.  Jesus, Chip.  Maybe suck her tits or something.  Chip.  Jesus.  Throw her down and call her pig roast, bitch.  Chip, you should work clean.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What's that?  You should work clean.  I do.  Yeah.  I would say I want to kiss a cuda.  I don't think Mr. Leno would like that language. 
[02:59:30]  I don't know.  I've never been on his show.  Jim doesn't have the courage to do me when he's around.  He really doesn't, does he?  Jim isn't that stupid.  Jim likes to have fun on the radio.  Jim's not going to vomit in front of four million people.  I'd love to see you get courage one night.  Jay wouldn't go, hey, that's Chip.  That's funny.  He would go, what are you doing?  And then he'd go, tits, tits.  He wouldn't go with it.  He wouldn't go with it.  No.  Nobody should go with it.  It's perfect for this throwaway show. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, it's time for, we have five hours or four hours a day.  It's different.  People get it, but I'll make it fucking four minutes.  Jay, anything on the Yoo-Hoo?  Yoo-Hoo is rocketing out of my asshole.  What are you trying to do, O?  I'm having a good time over here.  Yeah.  How's up the house?  We're having a good time over here.  What are you trying to do?  You're trying to fucking, hey, spider.  I'm just trying to lighten it up a little bit.  I'm trying to lighten it up, Sam.  What's wrong with you?  Spanky pussy.  Spanky a pussy.  A pussy. 
[03:00:30]  And he did pick you in the draft, Otto.  I saw it.  You know what doesn't get enough trash in that Otto says?  Ah, sugar.  What?  What's the story with Patrice?  A lot of people are asking me about him on the road and stuff.  It's an extended family.  Honestly, we addressed it this morning.  We just don't know.  You don't know anything?  No.  We don't know.  We have no new info.  How do you not know, though?  That's what makes people crazy.  It is what it is, brother.  It's crazy for us, too, dude.  We have to wait for the family.  It's with a stroke.  Oh.  It's like it's one of these things.  It doesn't just happen immediately.  I'm not a doctor.  I don't know.  I've heard it can go good.  It can go bad.  I don't want to speculate on Patrice's health. 
[03:01:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's like if I knew, I would tell you.  I would tell anybody.  But is there an update at all?  The same thing.  The family is keeping everything close to the vest.  No one's been up to see him.  Right now, he would just get out of ICU because that's why we couldn't see him.  And he's the same thing.  So it sucks for everybody because we want to know, too.  It just fucking sucks.  I want to see him. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  What hospital is he in?  Oh, you can't say.  Yeah.  I'm not going to say him where he is.  Oh.  Not on the air.  I'll tell you personally.  That's rough.  It's fucking rough.  He'd be a great guest on the pig roast.  So right when he gets healthy.  Yeah.  I mean, sure.  I mean, I can't imagine what he's thinking.  Not being able to verbalize.  I don't know if he can or not, to be honest with you.  I don't know.  I honestly do not know.  Yeah.  I got to go.  What is the pig roast?  I got to go.  I'll talk to you later.  Jay, nice talking. 
[03:02:00]  Congratulations on fucking number one and being the number 10.  Number 10.  I'm a number 40.  No, I'm bringing you up.  Jay.  And I block everybody that Bobby blocks and everybody that Obi blocks.  A wonderful game.  Good.  I block whoever you block now.  I like that game.  And that's what I do now, too.  We're a team.  You might have been motherfuckers off.  What's up?  Did you get knocked down at 10 because of the qualities of the actual podcast?  Well, nobody knows the quality.  When people subscribe to it, they don't know the podcast.  You know what?  It could be. 
[03:02:30]  Look, there's a lot going on.  But I'm thinking that.  Can I just say something else?  No, because I'm thinking it's word of mouth.  So someone might have said, you know what?  This week, the quality is a little rough.  Nope.  And maybe that fucked you up a little bit.  But there's things before the podcast that make people a little angry.  I don't know what that means.  What do you mean?  Well, I know what that is.  Commercials?  Yeah.  Kevin Smith.  They've got a lot of commercials before the...  Who said that?  Who fucking said that?  I did.  Sam and E-Rock. 
[03:03:00]  I'm out of this one.  What are you saying, Sam?  What could you say to both of that?  I listen to the Smodcast Network.  They're a great podcast.  Great podcast.  But I believe what you're referring to.  It's almost like the Glory Hole Network.  That's another great book.  We're not talking about the pig roast.  Glory Hole Radio.  I've got to go.  I've got to go make sure my heart...  Because I might die.  You're not going to fucking die.  You're a gas, stupid.  Exactly.  If everyone around you is going to die.  It would be funny if the doctor said that.  You're telling everyone around you, Leon.  Yeah.  Pig roast. 
[03:03:30]  More stories.  Tomorrow.  And then GloryHoleRadio.com for the You Know What Dude podcast.  I'm looking at that hat just thinking how good a fucking...  Bobby wants to...  Showing insurance from a man in a white coat.  This is when they...  Exactly.  Good humor, man.  Let's organize a little bit.  Bobby's stepping out.  So you're out.  I've got to go.  I've got to go fucking do my stress test.  You did a great job today, Bobby.  Thank you very much.  I hope a fucking bullet tears through that hat.  Why?  I'm walking out the door for 45 fucking minutes.  It would just be fun to see you get a fucking bullet through your hat.  But why does it have to be through the hat?  Because I hate your hat. 
[03:04:00]  Can I see the hat?  Just say you hate the hat.  Why does everything have to bullet with you?  Bullet.com.  Bullets.  More bullets.  Shut up.  We get it.  You want things dead, stupid.  Fuck.  I wish you were dead.  How's that sound?  You fucking pug shit.  Oh, yeah?  Goodbye.  At least my heart's okay.  Fuck.  Jesus.  Shit.  Christ almighty.  What the fuck, man?  I don't know.  You got to make fun of me or something.  What the fuck are you?  Now you're worried about your heart.  I'll see you later.  Can I see your hat?  No.  You see my hat?  Can I see your hat?  No, you can't see anything. 
[03:04:30]  Why is Chase so haughty?  What is he doing?  I hope you fall down the steps with a cabinet of something on your chest.  Why do you hate his hat?  Is it a low quality of it?  This is a high quality hat.  It's not a high quality hat.  It's a fucking movie.  High quality hat going over something empty.  Very cheap, thin cardboard rim on that.  That's not a cardboard rim.  What's the name of the hat?  That's a fucking John Vixen.  It's not.  Can I see it?  It's a John Vixen fucking Scali.  Is that a black guy's hat?  Like you wear it backwards?  Yeah, it is.  Fuck that black cock.  I'll see you, Bobby.  Bobby is gone. 
[03:05:00]  That's good.  Good luck.  You'll be fine.  Bob Kelly on Twitter, right?  Or Robert Kelly?  Robert Kelly on Twitter.  If this is the last time I see you, remember I love you.  In 45 minutes, I'm going to fucking half walk out the dog.  What's wrong with you?  I'm just saying, if you happen to die today, I love you.  Are you out of your mind?  No, because nobody dies when someone says that to them.  No one dies when they say that to you.  Bobby, it's always too late.  I used to say to my girlfriend all the time, unless I'm killed in a plane crash, I'll see you soon.  Because no one ever dies in a plane crash after saying that.  I enjoyed my time with you.  Just so you know that. 
[03:05:30]  As you're staring at that light, just know that.  I do hope he gets clipped by a truck hauling Diet Shasta as he steps off the curb on the way out of the building and then really needs a doctor.  Pig Roast!  Pig Roast.tv  Sam, what were you going to say?  Oh, shit.  What's that?  This is a stirring the shit thing.  It's not stirring the shit.  It's stirring the shit.  I listen to Smodcast all the time.  What's the problem?  What were you going to say?  What were you going to say?  It sounded like you were going to say something.  Because Jay was talking about what happens before the podcast and before all the Smodcasts, they put a lot of commercials. 
[03:06:00]  How long?  Like how many?  Because I don't listen to the guys skip forward.  There's a lot, enough that...  What are the commercials for?  For other things on the Smodcast network and...  How many minutes would you say it goes on?  Because I don't even know.  It's several minutes.  I mean, it's long.  And not long enough that me and my fiancÃ© were listening to Jay Moore's podcast in the car and said, Jesus Christ, another commercial. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, but they've got to pay these guys somehow.  They've got to pay the bills.  You've got to have...  Commercials are necessary.  But they're paying themselves.  What Sam is saying is commercials for their own shows.  It's commercials for...  Yeah.  I mean, it's not...  Is it a necessary evil?  It's commercials for other Smodcasts.  Oh, okay.  Would that be a necessary evil?  I wouldn't...  I mean, I don't have the business model, but I wouldn't think it's necessary.  How big is the Marc Maron show?  Is that pretty up there?  It's the biggest in the world.  He's the fucking CNN of podcasts.  He is, yeah.  He's got so many comedian interviews, though. 
[03:07:00]  He's been doing...  It took Marc three years to get any traction on that.  I mean, but he's been busting his ass for a long time.  He's the godfather right now.  Yeah.  Here's the good news for anybody in the audience that listens to Marc's podcast.  You can know the fundamental truth that he fucking hates you.  Yeah.  Whereas I like you.  Talk about the pig roast, you fucking balding, washed-up fucking hack.  Remember that time in that movie I made that no one saw? 
[03:07:30]  I just fucking banished you, junkie.  I saw your movie on an airplane.  I fucking jumped out.  All right.  I just thought you guys would enjoy Colin going, ah!  We do.  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  Don't make a big deal.  What does Colin do?  He did that HBO thing.  I mean, what does he do?  Does he do the road?  He's on the road a little bit, yeah.  He went out for a few months.  I'm working on my manifesto.  He seems like he'd be very unhappy on the road. 
[03:08:00]  Like, he's got to be in New York or LA.  He's unhappy in New York.  He's unhappy on HBO.  He's unhappy everywhere.  Really?  Yes.  He's a thin-fingered idiot.  His thing now is to have everybody on Twitter.  Twitter haters.  He's going for Twitter haters.  He's great on Twitter.  He's so funny.  Otto Pig roast.  This is the big premiere with Jimmy, right?  Yeah, man.  Star of the Antisocial Tour.  Yay.  When's the next Antisocial appearance, Jimmy?  It's funny.  You should say that.  It's January 15th in the Borgata.  The 14th is sold out, yeah. 
[03:08:30]  So let's hope it goes well.  It'll go well.  We'll add a second show.  We'll get you up and running in no time.  Second show's already added.  First one's sold out very quickly.  Second show's taking longer since it's a Sunday show.  But doing well.  Oh, yeah.  We talk about the fucking pig roast.  I'm fucking sitting around with, I look like Gene Simmons.  Oh.  What happened?  Jay's out of his mind.  Jay?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  I thought I looked like Gene Simmons.  It's going to be the big closer.  I didn't get the Gene Simmons line.  Yeah.  You look like Gene Simmons?  No.  George looks like fucking Gene Simmons.  Oh, George.  He's a more believable wig.  You know what?  Same hair, too.  You know what?  That should have got a laugh.  Logan, what the fuck?  Out of all the fucking puppets, you take the one that looks like Gene Simmons?  Get the A freely puppet.  He's available.  I got to go. 
[03:09:30]  Rejection.  Bye.  All right, Jay.  Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore 37 on Twitter.  PigRoast.tv.  Yeah, it should be good.  This coming Tuesday.  So what can we look forward to as far as the pig roast season goes on?  That's a good question.  How many episodes?  We shot 10.  We have a recording star from Italy.  I forget her name.  A lot of musical acts.  We didn't want to just do comic because all I could bring was comedy. 
[03:10:00]  They were relying on me to bring the acts in.  So I was trying to have maybe one comic every other show.  I didn't want it to be a stand-up show.  How many guests to show?  We have a lot.  We've been averaging four or five guests for a half-hour show.  It's a lot, right?  I don't know.  We cut the interviews down.  We keep cutting them down to make them, you know, tight.  Who else was on my show?  There was a lot of guys on your show.  Kevin, that band, Bagorn.  I can't remember the order because it was all a big, it was like going to another planet 
[03:10:30]  every time we shot.  And then by the end, we were shooting two in one day because they were running out of  money to produce it.  And they found out it was cost the same to shoot two in one day as one.  And that's why you always do two shows in one day because you pay less on the theater  expenses.  And what happens?  You go to pigroast.tv and then starting Tuesday.  Is it .com or .tv?  .tv.  Oh, yeah.  And you could just watch it?  Yeah.  I think it's going to start airing.  At your leisure?  Yeah, exactly.  And you could watch the other. 
[03:11:00]  If you miss a show, it'll always be available.  And there'll be a lot of extra bonus shit.  But I think it's going to start airing during the middle of the day.  I thought he was going to air it at like eight or nine at night.  But I think he's just going to start it in the morning and just see who.  Really?  Yeah.  Just get it up there.  With the web, things can go out.  Because you're looking at total views, right?  Yeah.  Then it doesn't matter.  Having, yeah, first thing in the morning.  Fuck it.  If it starts Tuesday, get it up Tuesday.  Now, what about tweeting?  How do I tweet Jay?  I don't know anything about that.  He wanted me to tweet.  You just tweet.  You don't do it now. 
[03:11:30]  Do it the night before.  The information.  Tell people the day it's coming out.  Hey, guys, today, it's right now, it's on.  Because people, especially with Twitter, it's very immediate.  No one's going to, you're not going to Twitter something today and people go, oh, great.  In six days, do it the day of or the day before.  Because it's so quick now, people will just go right to it.  I just snap.  That implies quickness.  On Tuesday, we'll all just tweet the shit out of it.  Okay.  That's how it's going to work.  That's how it goes down.  Okay.  And we'll talk about it on the air.  You can tweet a little bit ahead of time, but Tuesday is the important day to just get it out.  Everybody.  They can always go back and watch it, too. 
[03:12:00]  If it's the second weekend and someone hears about it, they'll go back and watch it.  Yeah.  I got to talk about girls.  Girls.  Yes.  Oh, girls.  Ever wonder what it would be like to dance on stage at a strip club?  Oh, boy.  Guys, ever think how hot it would be to see your wife, girlfriend, or friend dance on a stage at a strip club?  Yes.  Well, here's your chance.  The Amateur Night Dance Contest at Rockland County Stiletto in Nanuet, Saturday night, November 26th.  So what's that?  A week from Saturday?

[03:13:30]  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  After O&A Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Opie, you're still technically in the studio.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms. 
[03:14:00]  Trojan Americas.  Oh, there's the boss.  Number one most trusted condom brand.  Opie went the hard route.  Otto's still here.  Hey.  Jim, you're still technically here.  Yeah.  Kenny's still here.  I have a meeting.  So, Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Oh, good.  I'm glad you got that in.  I have a boy, Kenny.  See you tomorrow.  Opie always talks about how tough it is trying to figure out whether he's going to stay here  and get stuck in the studio doing radio or go outside and talk to the bosses when they're 
[03:14:30]  outside.  Are they outside?  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of them's out there.  Which one?  Gary.  Okay.  I mean, I'm sure that they're not talking about bad things.  They're probably just talking about the Hard Rock event tomorrow.  But still.  And it looks like they're waiting for you.  They don't need me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what we do in here, Otto.  They don't need me.  They can just do what they got to do.  Are you excited about the Hard Rock tomorrow?  I am, actually.  I love live.  I can do one a week.  Live events.  They're my favorite thing to do on the show.  They're fun. 
[03:15:00]  They're really fun.  They're easy.  But I say easy because you're just goofing with people.  And with radio, we don't have reactions.  Comedians, we're used to, you know, a push and pull with an audience.  But on radio, you just have the room, but you don't have an audience.  And that's what happened the last time we went to the Hard Rock a couple of months ago.  And, like, we filled up the place.  And it seemed like everybody on the show forgot that there are people actually interested in the show.  Like, we forgot that there are listeners and people who are, like, cheering and laughing at this.  Because it had been so long.  Satellite's really scary sometimes because you just don't know who's listening. 
[03:15:30]  Because there's no Arbitron system or there was no whatever, the PMs or whatever.  Sure.  People meters.  I noticed it when I'm on the road in places I've never been to.  Like, in Utah, the four shows were mobbed.  And I've never been to Salt Lake.  And we were never on regular radio there.  So it's like sometimes you've got to go out to the area to realize, wow, people do listen to this show.  Yeah.  And the floor seating that was reserved is all gone.  It was gone in, like, 45 minutes for the Hard Rock show.  Yeah.  But come by because you will get in.  Yeah, because the whole upper section is being opened. 
[03:16:00]  So we're going to have room for, like, 400 people.  Yeah, it's going to be fun.  So everybody's going to have room.  So come down to the Hard Rock tomorrow in Times Square.  It's at 8 in the morning.  And we're going to be there until 11 doing all kinds of stuff.  And you guys are going to be signing those Iron Sheik pictures.  We had them printed.  We actually have them.  So, Otto, have you seen that picture?  You know the wrestler of the Iron Sheik?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  He was in here, and he was yelling.  And throughout the interview, he got this little piss stain on his pants. 
[03:16:30]  See you later, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  He got this little piss stain on his pants.  Yeah.  And as the interview went on, he yelled harder, and the piss stain just started growing and growing.  Oh, my God.  He didn't know it was there.  Are you looking at the picture?  Yeah.  He didn't know this piss stain was there, so everybody wanted him to pose for pictures with them afterwards.  So, we're blowing up that picture with the Iron Sheik piss stain.  We're going to have him 8 by 10s, and Obie, Anthony, and Jim are all going to sign the pictures for fans.  Geez, he's a mess, huh? 
[03:17:00]  Tomorrow at the hard rock, yeah.  He wasn't aware that he pissed himself?  He had no idea.  Look how big the stain is.  Wow.  He had no idea.  You've got to remember, it started off with him sitting on the couch.  Yeah.  And Voss pointed it out, and then all of a sudden, the circle just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger throughout the entire interview.  Yeah, but then it gets cold after a while.  Doesn't it get cold?  You think any liquid that's on your pants, once you stand up and your pants start to adjust, you think you feel that your pants are all wet.  He's out of it.  He really was out of it.  He also, he had been drinking quite a bit that day. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I was going to say.  What, at 5 in the morning?  Because of Bex?  He went on Howard's show before us, and they gave him all kinds of beer.  And then he came on to our show.  He probably had five beers with us.  Oh.  So, I had no idea.  By 9 o'clock, he was gone.  And he was drunk enough that he pissed himself and had no idea.  That's so bad.  That's awesome.  But yeah, like Jim said, it is amazing that you don't realize people are listening.  Like yesterday, on the after show, like I always assume there's like a handful of people listening to this. 
[03:18:00]  But all day, we talked about, the after show was completely mundane yesterday.  We talked about me getting razor bumps because my hair is curly.  Right.  And then Larry the Cable Guy was on and just kind of talked about a contest he was promoting, and that was it.  Like, I was like, ah, whatever.  That's a huge guess.  I know.  I had no idea.  All day, every replay, people are tweeting me and sending me stuff saying, that was awesome with Larry the Cable Guy.  You forget that this guy's gigantic.  Yeah.  He sells out fucking football stadiums. 
[03:18:30]  And that's what he said.  He was in here, and he was like, yeah, you know, you find out you have a lot of fans somewhere, and the town doesn't have a theater, but they have a basketball stadium.  So you play the basketball stadium.  You go, what?  I fucking believe it.  It's not even relatable at all.  Yeah.  Basketball stadium.  And then people are tweeting me and sending me feedback on the website and everything, talking about giving me shaving tips.  Really?  It's like I thought this was the most boring thing that's ever happened.  But it's funny.  I think we're all pretty excited about the pig roast.  What kind of shaving tips did he give you?  You see, I get these razor bumps here, and Jim was asking me about how I get rid of them, and I just told him the straight answer. 
[03:19:00]  There was no jokes.  I said, you just use a single razor blade instead of the razor blades with, no, no, no, like the throwaway Bic razor blades that have one blade instead of four.  Is that better for you?  For me, yeah, because I guess it pulls, but this is what I'm saying.  See, this is not like an interesting, specifically, conversation.  Have you tried different shaving creams to gel and all that shit?  I've tried a couple, and then today Bob Kelly came in.  And he goes, yeah, people were tweeting me telling me to give you shaving tips, and he gave me advice for shaving cream. 
[03:19:30]  It's amazing the things that just start here.  But everybody's pretty excited about the pig roast, because this is something, like, you started the pig roast, your internet TV show, way back, like months ago, right?  Started shooting it.  Right.  Yeah, it was in the fucking middle of the heat wave, and we were in this metal building in Hoboken, so it was like an oven in there.  And they finally blocked the skylights out, which were, like, acting as, like, magnifying glass. 
[03:20:00]  It was so fucking hot in there.  No AC, I'm assuming.  There was AC cranking, but it didn't do shit.  It was the studio lights and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, so you had the skylight that's just baking you, and then all the studio lights shining on you?  Yeah.  Oh.  And then one taping, George's mouth mechanism broke, so that caused a panic, and we had to rig him up, so I was working, it was hard to describe, but I was working backwards.  Instead of pulling the lever down to open the mouth, I had to pull, I had to keep it down to keep the mouth shut. 
[03:20:30]  In other words, if I wasn't touching the mouth mechanism at all, the mouth would just, I opened slack, George.  So it's not like, it completely, you were talking about keeping up the illusion before, that completely just demystifies everything.  Yeah, I had to do everything backwards that day, so I've been through some hellish experiences during the shooting, so I was just grateful when the heat started to subside, you know?  How many episodes did you tape? 
[03:21:00]  We taped ten.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it was brutal.  And they're handing your shit every four seconds, changing lines on you, and it was like a whirlwind, you know?  It felt good when the day was done, because I knew I had done a lot, but it wasn't enjoyable, the actual doing of it.  How many episodes were you taping in a day?  The last four we did in two days, but before that we were doing one.  We were doing just one show a day.  Because you don't want to get burned out, like you're doing three, like those game shows, they tape like nine game shows in one day, and that's where, but there's nothing to them. 
[03:21:30]  It's just like, all right, get them up here.  The money is a great incentive.  I had never worked this hard for no cash at all.  Zero cash, just the hope that the thing takes off.  Right.  Um, and then, and then having to, um, be in every sketch and every, every facet of the show.  Right.  And I kept telling myself the night before, like, I'm, I'm going to really, like, be in the moment and enjoy the doing of it, but it's not possible.  No.  There's too much work. 
[03:22:00]  And plus your name is plastered on it, so it's like you can't, if you do give up control.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden this guy that you've given up control to has complete control over your name.  Yeah.  So you have to work your ass off otherwise.  I only had one meltdown where I, I knew I'd sucked and I, and the show sucked and I was horrible and it's a waste of time.  What happened?  I just had a, I just had a bad tape go off in my head that I sucked and I was talentless.  You know, just shit that my mother said to me years ago, resurfacing.  Um, so, um, the producer came over to me and he goes, he goes, you got this look on your face. 
[03:22:30]  He goes, everybody's like you, you know, you, you're the source of everybody's enthusiasm.  If I, if I lose enthusiasm, the whole thing goes into the shitter.  Sure.  So he, he got me out of it.  I was just having a bad, you know.  Did you go off on anybody or were you just collapsing inside yourself?  It was towards the end of the day and I was kind of rude to this comedian.  He said I was really rude to this comedian, but I just didn't know what to ask him.  He'd only been doing it like a month.  So you're like, what am I interviewing you about?  Yeah.  It's like, I don't know. 
[03:23:00]  I didn't know what to say to him.  Um, I, I, I guess I was in some kind of a trance cause I don't even remember being rude.  But, um, after that I put on a better face.  Is it tough for you to be a host?  Like, I, I don't know if that's something you're used to.  I don't know if I'm not, I had no experience with that at all, but it's just trying, I  was just trying to, um, have a natural curiosity and my, my, my out was that if I, if the interview  sucked, George would just attack me and the guest, you know?  So I had that.  And that way, if George, if George is attacking you and the guest, you're like, look, we're 
[03:23:30]  all taking it.  So it's not just you attacking someone.  Yeah, it's true.  I get most of the lashes that way.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm not just picking on the guest.  Um, we, we would discuss, you know, who to be like reverential to it.  We almost had on Pat Cooper, but at the last minute he went, um, I'm 84.  I'm not coming.  I'm 84.  Come to the Friars Club.  Yeah.  We want to do a whole, we want to do a whole show with Cooper.  But he just said, I'm 84.  Fuck it.  Come to the Friars Club, you know? 
[03:24:00]  Can you sit in there?  Huh?  Can you sit in there?  Yeah, sure.  Who is that?  David from Israel?  Yeah.  Oh, he's a fan.  He's a super fan.  Of course.  Yeah.  From Israel?  David from Israel.  You've called in a bunch of times.  What's up?  He was sitting out there when I first got here.  Yep.  You're from Israel?  Yep.  Really?  Are you in the military?  Nope.  No?  Grab the mic.  Grab the mic.  Do you, you live in Israel?  Yep.  Wow.  How'd you get exposed to this show?  Because I listened before I moved.  Oh, I see.  And what, do you listen online?  Yep.  What's the Israel ONA community like? 
[03:24:30]  Is there a lot of fans?  No clue.  What do you mean no clue?  You don't talk to people?  Nope.  What do you do in Israel then?  Yeah.  Autumn, I'm starting to have one of those meltdowns during this interview right now.  I look like a good Jew and make money.  That's all right.  What kind of work do you do?  Soft switch engineer.  Yeah?  Um, today is, what's Israeli food like?  Like hummus and falafel and shit?  I don't eat that shit in American food.  You eat American food there?  Is there like good deli, like corned beef and shit if you want it?  That's too stereotypical. 
[03:25:00]  We don't eat that there.  What do you, what do you eat?  That's a New York Jew, Jew food.  That's not an Israel.  Jew from Brooklyn to be particular.  What do you get there?  Like what, what kind of American food do they have in Israel?  Hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken.  Okay.  Whatever you guys eat.  Well, did you move to Israel for the work?  I went there for vacation and found a pretty good job, so I stayed.  Who finds a job while they're on vacation?  Shit happens.  You went there on vacation, that's interesting.  Nobody can find a job here when they're looking for jobs, and you find a job while you're on  vacation in Israel.  I guess so.  I'm making there more double than I ever made over here. 
[03:25:30]  Jesus.  And I have a pretty good position over there.  I run a company, so.  You run a company?  I run the technical side, so.  So who's running it now?  I'm still working even though I'm on vacation.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Like I said, us Jews like making a lot of money.  I guess so.  What is the danger ratio there as far as a missile taking a leg off or something like that?  Is that an everyday occurrence, or is that like another, they always go, oh, it's another  part of town.  I don't believe that shit for a second.  You're right there. 
[03:26:00]  It depends where you are.  There are also the occasional bombings.  Right.  But security there is very tight, and it's not as often.  The occasional bomb, you talk about that like you're in New York.  Yeah, there's a blizzard every once in a while.  Yeah, we get bombed every once in a while, but it's not that often.  It doesn't happen all the time.  How often?  Like how long have you been there for?  About six years.  And how many missile strikes have there been?  Oh, missiles?  There have been thousands.  Thousands of missile strikes.  Jesus.  Oh, there's like four a day.  The Jews do love money.  So you doubled your income, and your odds of being annihilated by a missile have gone up 
[03:26:30]  by the hundreds.  No, where I am, it's not so bad.  Yeah, of course.  It's not so bad.  The money's good.  The missiles are coming from Gaza, which doesn't come to my area.  It's far enough.  It's far enough.  Those bad old putty tats.  What's wrong with you?  Hey, listen, you could be walking downstairs and somebody could hit you.  It's not like, you know.  Well, yeah, it's true.  You are from what part of Brooklyn were you from?  I'm not from Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Well, how did Brooklyn come up?  We're talking about the deli in the field.  Oh, okay, okay.  What part of Jersey were you from?  Newark?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Because I was going to say Newark, you'd probably be like, thank God.  I'm in Israel now.  I feel safe.  Lakewood's pretty nice, isn't it?  Is it?  Yeah, it's Jewtown.  Is it Jewtown?  You're very Jew-centric.  Are you very proud of your heritage?  I'm very proud that I'm Jewish.  How long have you been a fan of the show for?  Been listening since 2009.  Right when they came to any deli.  So you heard the...  Spaz and everything else.  Did you hear the intern David years?  Of course.  What did you think of that?  I mean, we had a...  Otto, I don't know if you remember.  We had this weaselly, like, intern, this skinny... 
[03:27:30]  He looked like he could have been in the Revenge of the Nerds movie.  Right.  Like, he was the stereotypical, you know, thick Coke bottle glasses geek.  I think it was Otto who gave the best description of him as,  he looks exactly what an old Jew should look like.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm almost positive.  He did, like, he did a kosher sports report.  I'm sure you interacted with him.  I remember that guy, yeah.  Right, okay.  But he would always come on the air, proud of his Jewish heritage,  Opie and Anthony would ask him questions about being Jewish,  and he would get everything wrong. 
[03:28:00]  I would always call in and correct him.  You would?  Really?  How did you feel as that, because, you know,  there's not a lot of Jewish influence on the Opie and Anthony show.  He didn't represent us well.  He really didn't know much, but, uh, typical American Jew.  Oh, yeah.  You find that to be a lot of American Jews don't really know what they're talking about?  They don't know much.  Most Jews are secular.  They're not really too religious.  I was brought up a little bit different, so I know a little bit more.  And you like that better?  That's life, life.  I mean, I just know more shit.  Life is life.  Just take it day by day. 
[03:28:30]  Holy shit, he is geeky looking.  That's Intern David.  I don't know if you've ever seen him.  Have you ever seen him before?  Nope.  So, what time do you listen when you wake up in the morning to a replay or whatever?  Do you stay up?  No, I listen live.  You guys are on at, what is it, 6 over here?  By that by, this is 1 p.m., so I'm in the middle of work.  I listen four hours straight, and then I get the wonderful show on now, the shit show.  Jesus.  He looks a little bit like Stephen Hawking's if he was younger.  If Stephen Hawking could walk.  Yeah.  He'd look like stupid Intern David.  Yeah.  Intern David now, just to update you, Otto, 
[03:29:00]  he's working at the World Trade Center Monument.  Oh.  Like, instructing families on how to find their loved ones on the thing.  Jeez.  But he refuses to acknowledge the show whatsoever.  What?  Like, Travis, our producer, he's been down there, and he goes, David!  And David ignores him, like he never said a word.  Opie's seen him, like, on the street, and David runs the other way.  Was there a bad ending?  No, he says, I mean, you've seen him.  You know what's actually going on, but he thinks that him being on this show, O&A, has cost him jobs. 
[03:29:30]  Oh.  Like, he goes to job interviews, and they won't hire him, as opposed to just him being who he is, is costing him jobs, you know?  Because you guys depicted him as a nerd and a geek and a simp?  I guess.  Simp.  That's a perfect word.  Simp.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I guess because, you know, I guess our show doesn't have the greatest reputation in corporate America.  But, I mean, David, you seem to be, David from Israel now we're talking to, you seem to be a pretty, you know, a pretty heavy part of corporate, well, corporate world, I guess. 
[03:30:00]  Yes, I know.  You know?  So you went on vacation to Israel, and you got a job and moved there.  Now, when you take a vacation from Israel, you come to New York?  Yeah, I come here a few times here.  You come back to see family and stuff?  Now, officially, I'm on vacation, I have a family wedding and stuff like that, so.  Oh, cool.  All your family still lives here?  I have one sister that lives there temporarily.  She's, like, vacation instead of hanging out there, but the rest of my family's from here.  Everybody's here.  Your family does a lot of vacationing, I'm finding. 
[03:30:30]  Everything happens on vacation.  I'm the only rich ones.  I'm the only one that really flies back and forth.  Yeah.  You're rich?  Did you say?  I'm the only rich one?  What did you just say?  From my family, I have the most.  Oh, I see.  And that's because you made the move to Mistletown.  Mistletown?  Occasional.  Well, so when I said bomb attacks, and you said seldom, and I was assuming missile strikes  counted as bomb attacks.  What did you mean when you said it doesn't happen too often?  You have the missile attacks that are coming in from Gaza, but it mainly hits Ashdod. 
[03:31:00]  And how far away from you are that?  Two and a half hour drive, three hour drive from there.  It's like Pittsburgh.  It's not that far away.  Those are the missile attacks, and that depends on Hamas whenever they want to act up, want  to make problems.  Right now, there was just that switch where they gave up a bunch of terrorists for the  soldier God, Shalit.  I believe half of the soldiers that they promised to give back, they gave back.  The other half, they're still waiting another month or two.  So Hamas wants the credit on their street that they got arrested and freed. 
[03:31:30]  So it's not in their interest to make problems.  As soon as they have their boys back, they're going to make more problems.  The bombings are something else.  The bombings are where they'll go into a cafe, they'll go into a mall with a bomb, or the  last one was at the central bus station, I would say about a year ago.  Like a suicide bomber.  Either a suicide bomber or the two pussies, so they'll just go ahead and put a bag and  blow it up and see what happens.  Oh, one of those see-something, say-something suitcases.  Oh, man.  But we're actually, but because of that, the security is, I mean, here if a suitcase is on 
[03:32:00]  the street, people will see it.  People may or may not call the police.  By us, if you went ahead and put a suitcase on the side of the road, or you put a suitcase  on the sidewalk somewhere, everybody leaves, they call the police, bomb squad comes in,  and they bring in a robot.  How many bombs have gone off near you?  How many?  Next to me?  No.  When I was there 11 years ago, I heard of a bombings.  I went down to see what it was like, the American tourist I was.  I went down to see, you know, what happens, but I've never actually been anywhere. 
[03:32:30]  You went down to see what what was like?  I want to see what happens.  Do you want to see, you know?  You blow up.  Yeah.  Well, no, it's the aftermath.  It's the aftermath.  It's not like, there's going to be a bombing here later today.  Let's go check it out.  Bring our camera.  That's what it sounded like.  So there was a bombing, and you went to go check it out.  That was the only one time, but the security is very, very tough.  My office building, the security guards, everybody's armed over there.  All these families mourning the loved ones that they lost in this bombing, and David is  over.  Oh, look at this.  This is pretty cool.  Just taking some pictures. 
[03:33:00]  Don't you have any national, like, pride where you want to, like, join the military or offer  some service?  Look at me!  You think I could join the military?  I could fire an Uzi.  You don't have to have a flat stomach to fire an Uzi into a room of Arabs.  And you have to be fit beyond that Israeli.  I'm still an American.  I'm just working there.  If you're Jewish, you're in Israel, and you're an American, and they hate Americans, they  hate Jews, and they hate Israelis.  You have three reasons to want those guys dead.  Eh.  Oh, God.  You're a wimp. 
[03:33:30]  No anger at all?  I mean, you just...  It's just a natural state.  I hate them.  I hate what they do.  But what are we going to do?  But what am I going to do?  Yeah.  The Jews have been hated, the central world hatred for so long that it's just a reality  that you just accept and run with it, right?  I mean, if they're going to make problems, I would be the first one to go ahead and move  them over if somebody's trying to come after me.  But as long as they're living their life...  I mean, I'm not going to be the one to say, hey, they're all a bunch of good guys.  There's just a few that are bad.  I think most of them are bad. 
[03:34:00]  I think most of them are troublemakers.  But I don't really run into problems.  I don't really have people to come over and start up with me if I think there's a problem.  And a guy comes running up to my car and tries to do something to me, I'll move them over  no problem.  Right.  But on the other end, if somebody else is living their life, if I don't like what they do  and I don't like what their people do to me, I'm not just going to go around and killing  people.  So if somebody's trying to blow you up, you'll stop them.  But if somebody's trying to blow up the guy next to you, you'll just keep trying to  because it's not me.  I didn't say that.  It's like if they're living their daily life and they're doing what they're doing, there's 
[03:34:30]  no reason for me to be carrying a gun and running around after them.  If I was living in a dangerous neighborhood where I used to work, where I was surrounded  by ARPS, I probably wouldn't get a gun.  If they pull up the guy right next to him, that's still going to put a crimp in his weekend.  He's not going to go on skate.  That's going to be a really exact bomb or a really shitty bomb for him to feel nothing.  I also love that.  A slight ringing.  The security's very tough.  They also heavily, heavily, heavily racially profiled by us.  If I'm going through a checkpoint, they'll look at me, see I'm Jewish, he has a Jewish  nose, let me go straight by. 
[03:35:00]  They like that.  Yeah, if somebody looks, you know, two shades of mocha, he's driving by, they'll pull him  over, take out his ID, and if they don't like the way he looks, empty out the car, check  him out.  Beautiful country.  That's the only way you could do it.  If they did it here, life would be a lot better.  So what do you do?  You're a suitcase salesman over there?  You sell to the bombers?  Yeah.  This is perfect.  Well, I mean, as long as they don't blow the suitcase up around me, I'll sell them the  suitcase.  I got to make money.  Not Jewish, I'm not.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:35:30]  But how about the way...  Missile strikes.  How about the way we cover what's going on with you, you know, on the news and stuff?  Like, you talk about thousands of missiles launching on you, and it doesn't seem like  we hear a ton about that over here.  You don't hear a ton about it.  Of course, as a Jew, I'm going to say the media doesn't like us so much, and they don't  always fully report it.  I thought you were in the media.  Somewhat.  And the other problem is, if there's a breaking story, something that happens once, like 
[03:36:00]  if there was a bomb, like where there was almost a bomb here in Times Square, almost  about a year ago, something like that.  So it was almost, it was a big story that happened here.  By us, it's happening so often.  I mean, by us, every single time it happens, it's in the news, you hear about it.  But it doesn't always be brought over, because you have shit happening all around the world.  So if this is something that would happen, I mean, whenever there is a bombing by us,  like when a bus gets blown up, or a cafe gets blown up, or something like that, it'll even  be over here on the news.  But the missiles, you hear about it, they mention about it, but it's just news. 
[03:36:30]  It's not something that once in a million years that happened.  A million years that happened, when we went into Gaza and we blew the shit out of them,  yeah, then it was a big story, because it's something big we did.  But unfortunately, the missiles happen all the time, that's not just the biggest story.  I like that David from Israel here just told Otto that he was not in good enough shape  to join the military, but he's sitting in front of us wearing a hammer strength cap.  He's not a workout hat.  That's true.  So you were saying before that the missiles always hit in one point, wouldn't they be?  They don't hit one point, they keep making them bigger and better, but it's hitting more 
[03:37:00]  to the south of Israel, not where I am.  What's over there?  Is that where the army installments are?  Well, no, that's as far as the Gaza's to the bottom left.  That's as far as the missile will go?  That's as far as the missile will go.  If they could blow us up from beginning to end from the entire country, they would.  Right.  They don't want peace, they want the entire country.  They don't want, you know, they're just doing it little by little.  And they're going to try to break us, and so far we're still here.  What is the main beef with the Jews?  They want that land, that's their holy land, they say?  It depends who you ask.  They say, well, it depends. 
[03:37:30]  Everybody's going to go in and say they want peace.  We're going to say we want peace.  They're going to say they want peace.  If you look hard enough, there are websites that say that if you translate their speeches  when they're talking, they're actually, when they speak in Arabic, they're speaking against  Israel, but when they speak in English, they speak for.  I don't speak Arabic, so I can't tell you for sure what they're saying, but that's what  they say, it's still propaganda, they try to do it.  But what I don't get is that there was a war.  Well, at the beginning, we were supposed to split it with them.  We were attacked.  I forgot which war it was.  I'm not a good history Jew. 
[03:38:00]  It was in 67.  We were attacked by Egypt and two other countries.  In six days, we wiped out three armies.  Right.  You started up with me.  Fuck you.  I chased you out of your land.  I got your land.  It's now mine.  Right.  Leave me the hell alone.  Why should...  It's like, as if Mexico were to go ahead and say, hey, we want California back.  We're going to stop making problems.  We're going to stop bombing you until we get our land back.  We took it from you.  You lost.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  I mean, and the problem that we have is also is not with the Arabs that live in Israel. 
[03:38:30]  A lot of people don't know this.  There is a big Israeli Arab population.  We have a bunch of Arabs living in Israel.  They have more freedom and rights in Israel by us than they have if they would be living in  Gaza and stuff like that.  There are a lot of Israeli Arabs.  They get wealth, social programs.  There's social health benefits by us.  Legally, there's no discrimination allowed if a person is Jewish or if a person's...  It happens because that's the way security is, but we treat them very well. 
[03:39:00]  The problem that we have is the people living on the other side.  We are working with the West Bank, with Muhammad Abbas, and they're trying to make peace,  but Gaza won't even recognize us.  They'll never work with us.  So it's just a war that's going to keep on going, and no matter what they say, it's never  going to happen.  It seems, yeah, it's been so long that it's like the norm.  They can't seem to end it.  Nobody's going to back down.  I don't think anything's going to happen until shit really blows up over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, because it's almost like people get confused over...  Like, they don't even remember really what they're fighting for. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, you forget what they get.  Like, you just simply ask, what's the beef?  And we have to go...  You know what I mean?  It's just been going on for so long that nobody even...  It's like the Wall Street thing, like, in the beginning you have...  Yeah, they're born into it.  The Israeli children have learned how to assemble an Uzi as part of their junior high...  You know, grade school.  Yeah.  It's part of the norm.  It's crazy.  How long after being...  Because I noticed when you were talking, you were saying, us, us, us, as in, you know,  Israelis, how long...  Was your family Israeli, or is... 
[03:40:00]  Oh, my family's straight up from here.  So how long were you in Israel before you started considering it your home?  You know what I mean?  Oh, I don't know, three, four years.  I was just hanging out there.  I was hanging out there and then got a job and thought I was going to come back, and job  got better and better, money got better and better, so I'm still sticking around.  If anybody wants to hire, I'm thinking of coming back.  You are?  How come?  Ah, I can't really talk about it over here, but...  Gotcha.  The summer's pretty hot, brutally hot there. 
[03:40:30]  Summer's hot there, but like now when I left there, it must have been 70 degrees, I  got on the plane in a t-shirt, I landed here and froze my ass off.  Yeah.  So it's actually very nice over there.  Just like Florida.  Eh, yeah, that's where it's like going, where it's nice.  Yeah, less missile strikes in Boca Raton.  Well, listen, I have to tell you, Otto, you've impressed me.  I think that you have turned into a great interviewer.  Oh.  I'm looking forward now because it's funny that he's here because you turn on interviewer 
[03:41:00]  mode immediately and people are going to be able to see you interviewing people.  Would you have somebody like David from Israel on the pig roast?  Hell yeah.  Like it's just, it doesn't, it's not giant celebrities like you were saying.  Oh, I want to know everything.  It's just interesting people.  I, I, I'd rather not sit on a plane that long just to satisfy my curiosity to go to  a place like that.  Yeah.  That's the main reason I don't go, you know, overseas and shit.  I, I can't stand a plane ride that's over seven hours long.  You don't sleep on planes?  No, I, I get, I get very ill, that recircle, circulated air.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:41:30]  I can't stand flying that.  It really feels, yeah.  Yeah.  Shitty movies.  Um, how long is the flight to Israel?  Flight, uh, going there is about 10, coming back it's about 11 hours.  From Kennedy?  You go from Kennedy or, uh, Newark.  Oh, okay.  And how often do you say you make the trip?  Uh, two, three, four times a year depending on work and depending on family, but.  It's a long flight.  Well, Dave, I, I'm, I'm glad that you represent us all that we were just talking about when  Jim was in here about not knowing where people are from.  Right.  And you're listening all the way in Israel. 
[03:42:00]  It's, it's, uh, it's a cool thing.  Um, that's great.  And you'll be able to watch, uh, pig roast.tv too, because that's, that's the beauty of the  internet now that everything is worldwide.  It's not a matter of figuring out if you get it on your TV or whatever.  It's all over the place.  It's amazing.  Some guy, some guy from Scotland just got in touch with me, uh, and I sent him a, he  wanted a DVD and, and, um, but Trish was communicating him and Trish sent him a DVD and I wanted to  find out how he knew, knew about me.  You know, just, uh, you know, if you're going to give a, give a guy a DVD, just say, how did 
[03:42:30]  you find, how the hell does a guy in Scotland know who the fuck I am?  I never played over there.  Yeah.  You know, maybe, I guess it was from the show prop most likely.  Maybe.  And I know the YouTube is crazy now.  I know a lot of people who just look up ONA clips on YouTube, like they don't have radios.  They don't listen to the show.  They just found different ONA clips on YouTube and everything's up there now.  But, um, it's pigroast.tv and we've played the preview clip on the air before, but that's  what's up on the website right now.  And it's definitely a sign of things to come. 
[03:43:00]  Have you, David, did you, have you seen the preview clip yet?  I didn't see the clip.  No, I heard it talking about it.  I'll, I'll check it out on Tuesday next week.  You got to check it out.  Cause it's, it's like, it's not just like a typical talk show cause it's more and it's  more than a podcast.  It's not a podcast.  It's, it's a real, like Otto was saying, it was filmed on a set, set lights, you know,  he's at a desk.  It's like a takeoff on a talk show slash old school variety show, right?  Exactly.  Yeah.  We have recurring characters.  Um, we did, we did some locations that we did that, uh, com can, com con thing, whatever 
[03:43:30]  that's called.  I was down there for that.  Oh yeah.  Jim and me saw you there at Comic Con.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We did that shit.  Um, we did a sketch on to catch a predator.  So that was shot somewhere else, uh, another location.  Um, next season, if we have a next season, we're going to try and do a lot of remotes.  Like I want to interview Lewis black on his bus.  Yeah.  I think he'd be more comfortable there.  I was going to ask the studio.  Yeah.  I was going to ask if you do that for people like, uh, Pat Cooper, if you would just go  and take a camera down to Friars club. 
[03:44:00]  Why not?  I think it'd be great.  Interview him there.  How nice is it to just be able to do it and not have to worry about like networks and  script supervisors and all this and that.  Yeah.  So far there, there's nobody interfering with anything we've, we said, you know, um,  I mean, I guess, I guess it'd be nice to have a little bit of interference cause you  want advertisers and stuff eventually.  Right.  Is that, well, how, how are you thinking about like, what's the next step for this?  If this is successful, do you bring in advertisers?  Do you try to sell it to somebody? 
[03:44:30]  That's all the producers job is to raise the, um, he's thinking liquor company, cigarettes,  you know, condoms, you know, um, he, what he was saying to me when he pitched the show  is that I got to reach a, a younger audience because you know, my average fan is now either  married with kids and doesn't go out anymore.  Or, you know, I have to, and that, that, that the younger, the people that are on the internet  would love my shit.  They just don't know who I am.  Yeah.  So we want to get in, we don't want to get those people to know who I am and stuff. 
[03:45:00]  And are you, is the only way to see the show on, uh, pigroast.tv or are you going to have  it on YouTube as well?  Or you don't know?  Probably both.  Eventually.  Yeah.  We'll probably put the highlights on, on there.  Yeah.  Otto will be tweeting it out and everything.  Um, if you, you know, if you're, if you were looking for sponsors and people who want  to talk to young people, you know who I would get is I hate Steven Singer.  I don't know if you know about I hate Steven Singer, but, uh, he's the silver guy,  right?  That's right.  He's selling Argentium now. 
[03:45:30]  A lot of people don't know what Argentium is.  It's Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.  Steven Singer's brand new collection of silver is made from Argentium, the king of all silver  metals.  Like you're about to be the king of the internet variety show.  Steven Singer is the king of silver.  Uh, the brand new collection starts at 149 bucks, which is, I mean, you know, for jewelry,  for silver, nothing.  Uh, it's more pure than sterling silver.  It's brighter than platinum, white gold, and sterling.  Uh, low maintenance, tarnish resistant, and Argentium is responsible and ethical because 
[03:46:00]  it's produced using only recycled silver.  Uh, if you want to check it out, you don't have to get off your couch.  You don't have to do anything.  You just pick up your phone and you call, uh, 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  They'll tell you about it.  You can look at it at IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM.  They ship for free.  They'll give you a money back guarantee.  Visit him in person if you can.  He's in Philadelphia.  Uh, David from Israel.  While you're in town, going on, you know, the O&A tour, I would say go down to Philly. 
[03:46:30]  He's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  He's got a beautiful store.  I'm there when I need jewelry because he hooks me up.  And I'm sure he'd hook you up, too.  Just tell him who you are and tell him I sent you.  Uh, that's IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER or IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM for all your Argentium and other jewelry needs.  So, I mean, it may be a good idea for you is what I'm trying to say.  Yeah, I'll be a lazy Jew and go on the internet.  Yeah, you could check him out on the internet, too.  Uh, where's Travis?  Because I want to talk about, uh, what we were talking about earlier.  You know, you talk about variety shows. 
[03:47:00]  We're doing this show at, uh, the Hard Rock tomorrow morning.  Yeah, that sounds like fun.  Yeah, it's gonna be fun.  Uh, it's at 8 a.m.  Uh, there's still room for people.  So, we had a RSVP list.  That got completely filled up.  But we're letting, like, another 400 people in  on a first-come, first-served basis.  Mm-hmm.  So, if you want to check out this show,  definitely come, uh, uh, come like 7.30, I guess, tomorrow  at the Hard Rock in Times Square and, uh, and check it out.  Because we're gonna be doing the mash, 
[03:47:30]  we're gonna do a mashed potato eating contest.  Uh-huh.  Uh, and that's just, that's gonna be going on the whole thing.  Somebody's gonna, they're, we're gonna have 10 pounds of mashed potatoes for each person.  Ouch.  Um, wow.  And whoever eats the most within the two hours or however long the show is,  is gonna get 500 bucks.  Is Pat from Munaki gonna be part of it?  That's the thing, he's not coming.  He's not coming.  Uh-uh.  He's got something going on.  I don't know why.  Is this who can get diabetes the fastest contest?  No, I don't think so.  But, uh, he's not coming,  so that leaves a lot of room open for people.  Because otherwise, you're not gonna want to enter. 
[03:48:00]  Because the 500 is going to Pat.  He's a professional.  David, are you going to the Hard Rock tomorrow?  Probably tomorrow, yeah.  Maybe you'll be one of the contestants.  Um.  I just found out I have diabetes, I know.  You just found out?  About a month ago.  I see Pat and the Nathans every year.  Yeah.  It's hard to get into that.  It is.  To qualify for that.  You have to go through qualifiers and everything.  You have to win a bunch of shit  before you get to the Nathans point.  Yeah, I mean, I know people who have tried  to get on to the, you know,  to the official game,  and they can't make it.  Pat makes it, has made it the last few years.  Mm-hmm.  He hasn't won one yet, but he will. 
[03:48:30]  No.  I mean, he's gonna get there.  Um, we're also doing,  I think we're gonna do listener karaoke.  Those fat guys never win.  It's those little weird guys.  Have you seen the guy, like Kobayashi?  Kobayashi has this weird thing he does with his body.  Yeah.  He shifts his organs around.  He's jacked now, though.  He's got, he's got muscles.  Yeah.  And he's, he's skinny.  He's got zero body fat.  Yeah.  But he eats like 47 hot dogs in a sitting.  Yeah.  It's, it's the craziest thing in the world.  It's incredible.  Um, but we're all.  What's that guy, his name, Chestnut?  Who's one of the likes of it?  Joey Chestnut?  Yeah.  Yeah, he like shoves like the hot dogs into his cheeks or something. 
[03:49:00]  How many, how many are they doing?  What's the time they do it in?  Uh, for the hot dog contest or for the hard rock?  I think it's 12, 10 or 12 minutes.  Oh, the, uh, the Nathans.  Oh, the Nathans.  Yeah, I think it's like 12 minutes or something.  For how, just how many, how many, how many does the winner do?  How many do they do?  I think close to 50.  Holy shit.  Joey Chestnut got in the upper 40s this year.  Yeah, they're up to that.  I mean, Pat, like Pat from Munaki, I think he usually does in the, in the twenties, like  the, you know, the high twenties, like 26, 27, 28, which is ridiculous for 12 minutes. 
[03:49:30]  I thought he was, I thought he was doing it just to get his name out there.  Like I figured he, you know, he would quit after 10, but you have to really look like  you're trying.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's go there for a free meal.  He makes an effort.  Yeah.  Sort of free meal.  He just loves hot dogs.  Sam, if they did a Snickers contest, you'd probably win.  No, I don't like Snickers.  A lot of chocolate in general.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  I couldn't eat.  I mean, I eat chicken a lot.  I don't eat a lot of chocolate.  All right.  I thought there was, wasn't there a contest, something wild back, like about a year ago 
[03:50:00]  where they had you eat as much chocolate as possible?  No, no, no.  That's right though.  That's what we're going to be doing tomorrow.  One of the interns.  Oh, it was one of the interns?  Yeah.  I think it was like on Halloween, a day after Halloween, we ended up with like a giant thing  of chocolate bars.  Correct.  And yeah, we just had intern Craig sit down for like three hours and just stuff his fat face with  chocolate.  Oh, fuck.  I think at 80 something, he ended up puking all over.  Yeah.  And then he just puked all over.  And the thing tomorrow is if you puke, you can puke, but you're out of the contest.  Oh.  So you can't just regurgitate.  Like, you know, we've had other eating contests where people just shove a finger down their 
[03:50:30]  throat and then they keep going.  Oh, that is disgusting.  It's horrible.  We had one thing where, uh, huh?  Never mind.  Was it eggnog?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had an eggnog contest where we had a guy, uh, puke and then drink the puke that he just  puked out.  Oh, geez.  I mean, I'm sure we couldn't do that anymore because now they're actually bosses paying  attention.  Yeah.  But back then it was like, it's insane.  Yeah.  Um, we're also doing listener karaoke.  I don't know how that's going to work, but I think we got a karaoke, uh, thing. 
[03:51:00]  And Travis, if you're there, I don't know if we should show the costumes because we have  outfits because the big event for tomorrow is the skit.  We're doing the first Thanksgiving pageant, skit, whatever you want to call it, like you  do in first grade, except we're using people from the show.  Uh, we're going to have like Ant and Stalker Patty are going to be pilgrims and Jim is going  to do, Jim's going to do Chip and him and Bobo and Voss are going to be Indians. 
[03:51:30]  And then, uh, E-Rock, you found out today that you were cast.  Yes, I did.  As the turkey.  I love how you act so fucking surprised.  He's going to be the turkey.  Yeah, E-Rock's going to get to be the turkey.  We have a turkey outfit back there and everything.  That's great.  What do you mean you love how I act so surprised?  Because you play off like, oh, I thought somebody would have told you by now.  You wrote the damn thing.  He's the closest looking to a turkey.  Whoa.  Um, you're okay playing the turkey though, right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Uh, are you looking forward to it? 
[03:52:00]  Um, I don't know what the turkey is doing in this performance, but, uh, I guess so far  I'm okay.  I don't know if we should show, I don't think we should show you the script before you go  on there.  Well, the turkey has, the turkey doesn't have lines.  Oh, yes it does.  The turkey's talking?  Oh, yeah.  We wrote, we wrote lines for the turkey.  Okay.  Um, we wrote lines for everybody.  We didn't want, uh, we don't want anybody to feel left out.  You can't just sit there going gobble, gobble.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Um, but you are kind of, what's more important on the first Thanksgiving than the turkey? 
[03:52:30]  You know?  I have no idea.  We waited.  Can I tell you the truth, E-Rock?  Yeah.  We waited, we were talking about this in the office a couple days ago, and we waited  to tell you on the air, because we thought that, uh, you would not be willing to play  the turkey, unless Opie and Anthony, specifically, on the air, said, E-Rock's playing the turkey,  and then they would push you into it.  Well, I don't think the turkey is really that bad.  Well, I guess, what could be worse in the skit than the turkey? 
[03:53:00]  Some of the other people's costumes.  Uh, well, we do have a special costume planned for, uh.  Bobby Bacala with the Santa suit, the fucking big pussy.  Shyness is a curse.  Fuck you, Santa.  We have, uh, we have a special, you've met, have you met Bobo, Otto?  Yeah.  Yeah, we have a costume planned out for him.  Oh, good.  He's gonna be, uh, we're gonna try to make sure he wears something revealing.  Something for the girls, you know?  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  Because, you know, they all like to see Bobo skimpy.  And Roland, uh, Roland's gonna be- 
[03:53:30]  Does Roland have a costume, too?  I don't think we have, maybe we'll put him, maybe the narrator should also be dressed.  We should dress like a pilgrim, shouldn't we?  A pilgrim.  Roland, do you think the narrator, because you're gonna be in the skit.  You're the narrator.  Is this something, you're not, uh-  Did Roland find out on the air, too?  Did anybody tell you ahead of time?  It's okay if they did.  Don't say it for the-  No, no, you said we have something for you.  Oh, okay.  What about Club Soda Kenny?  Uh, Club Soda Kenny's gonna be acting as security.  Oh.  And all I'll say is that, uh, I did write something in for a security guard, but I don't want to say more than that, because I don't want to spoil it for the parties involved specifically, as well as the audience. 
[03:54:00]  He's funny as an Indian.  I know.  Club Soda Kenny be funny as anything.  No, he's-  Yeah.  He's awesome.  Yeah.  Um.  The narrator's neutral.  Yes, the narrator is neutral, but are you worried?  Because you're not known for your public speaking abilities.  You're on my reading skills, that's correct, sir.  Are you worried at all?  Standing in front of the crowd?  You-  We-  The last Hard Rock event we did, it was staff stand-up, and Roland did well.  Uh, he did get some help with his jokes, but I think that's okay, because, you know, first-time stand-up's gonna get help with his jokes. 
[03:54:30]  Um, it was more your stage presence that I think impressed people.  Um, are you feeling confident about this one?  Mm, if people piss me off, I just focus my rage, and I'll ad-lib a lot in the script.  You just take shots at people?  Yeah, adding rape, death.  No, Roland.  I'm hoping that you'll be fucked in the mouth.  Me?  No, no, I'd say people who piss me off, bad things will be added on.  How would-  How would be paterno jokes?  I don't know.  This I gotta see.  Paterno jokes?  Yes.  Well, first of all. 
[03:55:00]  Sandusky jokes.  Yeah, you should realize, as Eric just-  I know, that's why I like that.  It's not-  Because you get more angry with paterno.  Because it's not paterno.  Exactly.  Um, are you, uh-  If people make me happy, I'll just stick to the script.  Yeah, has anybody showed you the script?  Uh, Travis handed me a script, but-  But you didn't read it?  No, because I know that by the time I get to Hard Rock, I'll be like, totally different.  Yeah, we changed some stuff.  Here's the new script.  And then I'm like, I go, okay, I'll memorize it.  Then I'm gonna spend time, I go, fuck it.  I'm gonna spend no time.  Are you glad that you're the narrator instead of something else?  Who knows what's gonna happen? 
[03:55:30]  At least you don't have to, like, act.  You think these guys are gonna act?  Well, they're supposed to.  Have you seen Voss when he acts?  Did you see when we had, uh, Chaz Palminteri on ONA?  No.  And we had, uh, Voss and Chaz Palminteri do a scene from A Bronx Tale.  Oh shit, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's on YouTube or something.  Hey, hey, do we have Bronx Tale production?  Was that great?  We have the produced piece.  Let me see if I have just the, the, the, the script without the produced stuff on it.  Yeah, see if it, if it's not too long, we'll play it for auto. 
[03:56:00]  I love Chaz, he's awesome.  Yeah, it was so, it was so great.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was the second time he was on.  Wow.  And he was just like, he picked it up.  Obviously, it's his thing.  But, I mean, he was out of the movie good.  Yeah.  And Voss was just horrendous.  What was he playing?  The kid?  I think so.  The little, yeah.  He was, he was the worst actor that you could imagine.  And, uh, Urock's looking for the clip because he, you gotta hear it.  That's hysterical.  Were you listening to that show, David?  Have you heard?  Do Voss speak like this? 
[03:56:30]  Yes.  Yes, I heard it.  What do you think of Voss's tattoos?  He's a, he's a Jewish man.  Um, Jews usually say tattoos are bad, but he put the star of David on his arm.  Still not supposed to, but he has it.  Shit happens.  That's it.  Nah, what are you gonna do as long as he's making money?  That life's simple.  Why make it complicated?  That's good.  We're sure.  And when you go to Israel, shit happens.  Shit happens.  Yeah, deal with it.  Um, I found the, it's one minute for the dry and then the produced is like a minute  ten.  Uh, I guess go with the produced. 
[03:57:00]  The produced one?  It's probably a little funnier, yeah.  Okay.  Here it is, Otto.  This is, uh, uh, Voss and Chaz Palminteri together.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, fiends, I want my money.  A bronc.  Tail.  Fiends, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here. 
[03:57:30]  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20 and it's been two weeks now and every time he sees me, he keeps dodging  me.  John, should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian, stammering his way through a few lines of  film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It cost you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again. 
[03:58:00]  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  Yeah, you're right, John.  You're always right.  A bronc.  Tail.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  That's great.  That was Hollywood Rich Voss.  That was great.  An idiotic Jewish comedian.  You see that person?  He is funny.  Voss is hilarious on stage. 
[03:58:30]  I'm just saying he's not the caliber actor that Chaz Balm and Terry is.  It's great.  Who's back in the office right now?  Somebody just run up with the turkey costume.  I would like Eric.  I think they took you to the Hard Rock.  Oh, it's already there?  Yeah.  I think they were on Death of Travis.  Everybody went to the Hard Rock.  Where?  Is Danny saying it's gone?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, the turkey costume's already gone.  I would have loved for you to see it and get your final approval on it, Eric.  Did you see it?  Yes, of course I did.  Mm-hmm.  I just saw it too. 
[03:59:00]  I'm sure my approval would really weigh heavy as far as what the costume's going to be.  That's why I wanted to show it to you.  It's almost like a grown man's baby turkey costume.  It is.  What do you think?  A what?  A grown man's baby turkey costume?  Yeah.  Like a little baby would wear it?  Yeah.  What do you think of...  So you didn't read Eric's part of the script either?  I didn't see his name on my script.  I think I got a different script that they think I'm going to memorize, so that's why  I just tossed it.  Yeah, you don't have to memorize it.  Are we going to be able to see this on YouTube when it's done, or you have to be there live 
[03:59:30]  to see it?  We should try to film it.  I'm sure we can get somebody to video it.  Definitely video and put it on YouTube.  Yeah, it's going to be funny.  I mean, you definitely want to see it in person if you can.  It's free, and it's a show.  Yeah.  We're going to do the after show from the Hard Rock 2, whatever time.  0 and a half till 11, whatever time they don't use.  We're going to take it over, and I'll do the after show with all of you people who are  there at the Hard Rock and everything.  And the big celebrity was going to be an Indian, but he couldn't make it.  Who? 
[04:00:00]  Duchovny.  You were trying to get David Duchovny to be an Indian?  He was in, but something came up for production.  But he'll be back in January.  That would have been great.  Yeah, he was in for it.  He was like, all right.  Wow, a real actor.  Instead, we got Bobo.  We got Bobo instead of...  I mean, yeah.  I mean, this is a real deal.  We actually have a production budget on this.  Wow.  We have real outfits.  We have...  You know, Jim is going to do Chip as an Indian.  Well, Opie's not doing anything?  Opie...  I heard you say Anthony, but...  Yeah.  Opie and Bob Kelly are going to be there kind of off to the side commenting on it for the 
[04:00:30]  radio audience.  Doing foley work.  Doing some foley work.  You know, stuff like that.  Making sure everybody kind of...  Making sure it translates to radio.  Because it can be a very visual thing.  Like, we're just...  We're concentrating on making sure that the fans at the Hard Rock get a good show.  Yeah.  So Opie's got to be there.  You know?  Making sure that the people...  Yeah.  The people...  Much more people listening at home.  Right, right.  Paul should be a pilgrim.  Are you going to be at the Hard Rock tomorrow, Paul?  Yeah, I'll be there.  He should be a pilgrim.  There's an extra outfit. 
[04:01:00]  Well, no.  I haven't...  We were talking about the extra pilgrim outfit because we were going to have, like, Pat  from Unaki and Big A in the skit, too.  But one of the first O&A shows that neither Pat from Unaki or Big A will be able to be  at.  Big A's a big part of the pig roast.  Yeah.  He is.  He just stopped in one time and we decided to use him and he just fit right in.  You can insert him into anything.  And it works.  Is there going to be any violence in this Indian and pilgrim story?  There'll be some violence. 
[04:01:30]  Tomahawk chops.  I'll just say there'll be some violence.  That's true.  Definitely.  We definitely wrote in...  Yeah.  We wrote in some...  Huh?  We can just fix your costume.  Uh...  You getting nervous?  Sam, you didn't finish what you were going to say.  We were thinking that maybe the narrator should be a pilgrim.  Then I'll be taking the pilgrim side of, like, cheering on the Indians for the casinos.  Well, I think we have an extra Indian costume, too, so maybe you are a pilgrim who has  Indian pants on. 
[04:02:00]  Or a costume change in the middle?  It's not a bad idea, Paul.  Wait, wait, wait, like Diana Ross?  Paul, you're going to...  You be careful.  You're about to piss Roland off and then he'll wish rapes and murders on you.  Oh, yeah.  I go, and the baker got raged.  I don't think anybody's going to piss you off, Roland.  We didn't write anything in the script that's negative about the, uh, uh, what's it called?  The narrator.  I know, but so you got people...  Oh, humble narrator.  Conveniently, I'm looking at the script that was sent.  A lot of things left off that script there.  The one for you?  A lot left off?  It's only, like, three pages. 
[04:02:30]  I got, like, one page or two.  Yeah.  It's a lot left off.  Do you have any lines on the script that was sent to you, Eric?  No.  That's weird.  Well, it's just something in the tech.  Maybe there's a virus going around or something.  You guys are fucking doing the J.J. Abrams where you get the fake script.  Exactly.  And then you go on set and go, oh, well, here's a real script.  Well, we don't want any leaks right now.  I see lines for the narrator, for, uh, Patty.  Mm-hmm.  And then there's a bunch of other lines that have no, uh, names assigned to them.  Yeah, I think you got a very rough draft. 
[04:03:00]  Somebody on Feedback is, uh, asking, uh, for us to get a mesh thong for Bobo.  Look, um, I don't want to give away too much, but the Native Americans wore loincloths.  And that's all I'm saying.  And also, they were drunks and they had casinos.  Well, that came later.  I don't know later, Roland.  Were there casinos built for the first Thanksgiving?  Without logic, we should give them a blanket with, like, disease on it.  Oh, canthrax for the hard rock?  Smallpox.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let's not get crazy. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah, smallpox.  Or just pass down the corner.  I'll just start drinking like an Indian.  What?  Can we dress him up after the show as an Indian and just put him on the corner?  I don't see why not.  You'll be drunk.  Sit down in the corner, drunk.  Fuck it.  I'll be an Indian.  You'll be drunk by that point anyway.  I just start screaming at you guys.  I don't know if you notice.  You brought me down.  About Roland, but he's a complete lush.  So is Bobo.  Yeah.  He can hang out all day.  Yeah, but Bobo, you get two beers in him and he's gone.  Hysterical?  Roland, I mean, to say he drinks to excess would be a severe understatement. 
[04:04:00]  He's got some legs.  He can drink for a while.  Yeah, Roland.  Because he has to rub elbows with show business people, so he's got to be able to handle his  liquor.  If they're like, Roland, let's go out drinking.  He's got to be able to hang with the SNL crew and do all this stuff.  I mean, obviously, you've learned well, Roland.  I learned.  I can do like 20 drinks.  I'll be like, eh, I'm okay.  Is this script finalized?  Is it locked or can we make some amendments to it?  We can make amendments.  Yeah, why?  Because I have an idea I'd like to add to it for the Indians.  For the Indians? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I mean, because there were some suggestions.  Actually, a couple of the hosts saw the script and there were some suggestions.  Even more lines are going to be added for the turkey, as a matter of fact.  What the fuck?  So congratulations, Eric.  Hopefully, you know, hopefully you get some real exposure out of this and let this be  the launching pad into the next big thing for you.  I hope.  This is his new acting career.  I would love if this bullshit got me noticed somewhere and I got a job and I can leave.  Yeah.  We can't Rob Cross be a pilgrim?  Thank God it won't. 
[04:05:00]  Huh?  Can't Rob Cross be a pilgrim?  No, we don't have any room for more pilgrims right now.  No, you can just walk around the room.  You can just want him in the skit.  Yeah.  You just take a shot.  Rob Cross is our boss.  He rocked an acting career out of this fucking turkey bit.  I love it.  Yeah, he thinks it's really going to happen.  There's no more Carvel change.  That's the only thing I can think of.  Maybe the turkey shows up on the pig roast.  I don't know.  Some kind of agent.  Well, if you want to see the pig roast, November 22nd is when it debuts, correct?  Yeah, man.  Thanks.  It's going to be on pigroast.tv. 
[04:05:30]  And I mean, around here, we've been hearing about this forever, so we're all pumped for  it.  And how often are new episodes going to be up?  I think every week.  I'm pretty sure.  That's what you're probably going to do?  Ideally, yeah.  It would go once a week.  Yeah.  It's going to be good.  How long is it?  Each show is 30 minutes.  And then there'll be some shows that we might have a lot of, like, to see the complete  interview go to this site or whatever.  Oh, I got you.  That kind of shit.  So, like, extra features like that. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah.  There was a guy, Jimmy McMullen.  McMullen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The rent's too damn high.  We had him on.  He's the only guest we had twice.  He rules.  He's great.  He's awesome.  He's just great.  Just wind him up and he goes.  We'll definitely make sure you check that out.  Come out to the Hard Rock tomorrow.  It's in Times Square.  We'll be there starting at 8, so get there a little before and there'll be room for all  of you after Open Anthony Live has been brought to you, as it always is, by Trojan Bear  Skin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Thanks for stopping by, David, from Israel. 
[04:06:30]  One more thing.  Am I looking to hire a soft switch engineer?  At Dovid, D-O-V-I-D on Twitter.  I'm looking.  Hit him up on Twitter.  Cool.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.
