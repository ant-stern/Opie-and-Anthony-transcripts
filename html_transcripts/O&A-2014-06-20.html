<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a frantic search for missing colleague Eric Nagel, who had mysteriously vanished on vacation.  Initial reports suggested he was in either England or Italy, fueled by conflicting information and a cryptic "ciao" overheard as he left the office.  A new intern confirmed the "ciao," solidifying the Italy theory, further supported by a peculiar voicemail message and an Instagram post featuring a Guy Fawkes mask.  Listener calls provided wildly inaccurate location guesses, while the hosts recounted past pranks they'd pulled on Nagel during his vacations, including whale noise phone calls.  The mystery of Nagel's whereabouts continued throughout the show, with the hosts eventually determining he was in Italy after numerous unsuccessful calls to various hotels in Florence.  Pat Monaghan, from the band Train, was a guest in studio during this portion.  Monaghan discussed his new album, "Bulletproof Picasso" (releasing September 16th), the challenges of the music industry, and the self-doubt inherent in his profession.  He shared anecdotes about less glamorous past jobs, including caddying at a Long Island country club where he encountered notable golfers and even mafia figures.  The conversation also touched on the peculiarities of somber piano music in commercials and the changing landscape of the music industry.  The segment concluded with the hosts' failed attempts to reach Nagel at his hotel, confirming his presence in Italy.

The show then transitioned to a conversation with professional wrestler Bubba Ray Dudley (Bully Ray).  Dudley discussed his career, including his departure from WWE and his current relationship with TNA wrestling, his relationship with Brooke Hogan and his girlfriend Velvet Sky, his fitness routine, and his preferences in women.  He recounted a humorous anecdote about throwing up in a limousine with Opie and Anthony, and the conversation drifted into discussions about highways and the hosts' dislike of the World Cup.  The hosts frequently complained about their poor studio equipment.

The discussion shifted to a comparison of American and European soccer, the relative attractiveness of women from different countries, and Dudley's experiences performing in Japan, including a humorous encounter with a Japanese woman at his hotel.  The conversation also touched upon the disgraced Miss Colorado contestant entering pornography, a viral video of a Miss Nevada contestant's ignorance of her state's capital, and Dudley's refusal to be placed in a coffin for a WWE event.  Dudley promoted his clothing line and social media, while also discussing a disliked fellow wrestler, Ethan, and playing an audio clip of a bad wrestling promo.  The hosts recounted their past radio show antics, including a story involving a naked woman on 57th Street and the "Whiffle Ball Challenge,"  along with a discussion of a previous guest who called herself the "Queen of Anal."  Dudley also recounted doing the YMCA dance at a gay bar in Montreal with The Rock and D-Von.

Dan Soder then joined the show, leading to a debate about the name of the sport (soccer vs. football), casual fans, and the appeal of the World Cup.  The conversation moved on to Delta Airlines' controversial giraffe tweet and the nature of corporate apologies, using JetBlue's response to a mother whose toddler urinated on a flight as an example.  The segment concluded with the hosts' intentions to go ten days without apologizing.

A news story about a three-year-old girl, Victoria, being asked to leave a KFC because of facial scars from a pit bull attack dominated a subsequent segment.  The hosts expressed outrage at KFC’s actions, noting their later $30,000 donation to Victoria’s medical fund. This spurred a vulgar debate about pit bulls, featuring listener calls with strongly contrasting opinions.  Comedic role-playing scenarios involving the complaining KFC customer ensued, along with a caller recounting a story of a police officer shooting a pit bull multiple times.  The segment also included discussions of travel experiences, including a negative experience with United Airlines.  Iraq, a co-host, called in to discuss his recent trip to Italy.  Numerous advertisements filled the segment.

E-Rock then detailed his Italian trip, describing his experiences in Rome and Florence, including observations about the architecture, cosmopolitan atmosphere, and prevalent English translations. He mentioned seeing war damage and Mussolini's hanging site. He recounted an awkward encounter with a listener who recognized him, discussed the differences between Italian and American food preparations, and his experience at an Italian McDonald’s. He noted the lack of Black Italians, the new microchip technology in European credit cards, and the energy-efficient design of some Italian hotels. The segment also included discussions of store loyalty cards and the popularity of *Louie* in Italy.

The show concluded with a listener's call about the documentary *Six Degrees of Helter Skelter*, leading to a detailed and graphic discussion of the Manson Family murders, the individuals involved, their motives, and the subsequent trials. A caller, Christine, shared her personal knowledge and experiences with the Manson Family and the events, including details about Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys' involvement.  The hosts and callers delved into the arrest of the family members, their motives, and the ongoing fascination surrounding the case.  The segment ended with further discussion of the fascination with true crime and serial killers, along with commercial breaks and promotional spots for SiriusXM DJ Tiësto, Sam Roberts' radio show, Retro Fitness, Famous Smoke Shop, LLC.com, and Zoom e-cigarettes.

Wait, he's still  gone? Yeah, he snuck out. He literally snuck out. He really did. No one knew. Well, I was told by a few 
[00:03:00]  people that to make sure I don't find out where he's, where he's going. Cause I'm a bad guy, I  guess. Uh, well, I mean, no, it, that whole thing was a complete mistake. He doesn't understand  things. Yeah, but then there was another time, like, it might not have been you, but it might  have, there was the other time that we called him when he was on his honeymoon. Yeah. People  were, people were warned not to tell me where he's going. He got back to me. I'm not stupid.  Who was? Huh? I'm not going to say who was saying that. Where'd he go? 
[00:03:30]  He's in Europe. He's in Europe? Yeah. Where does this Nagel guy get his money? Is he in  Europe? I don't know. What part of Europe? You know damn well where he is. Why is everyone  scared? I don't know. I didn't. I'm insulted that he, he, like. Exactly. We could talk about  it. I'm insulted that he, he told a lot of people to make sure that we don't know where  he's, uh, going away. Where'd he go? And Sam knows. England? Sam knows. I don't know. 
[00:04:00]  England? Italy? Why are you looking at each other? Because we're, I think Travis and I  are also trying to figure out, there's a lot of mystery with, with this Nagel. Yeah.  We all know that. But we want answers. I'm not told Europe. Really? Yeah. Oh, so maybe  the Europe thing was to throw me off. I think it was. I don't think he's in Europe. I doubt  it. Probably some fucking Simpsons thing here. Oh, I bet. Remember the Simpsons park? How long  goes that? Dumb Simpsons amusement park. Exactly. Standing around big plastic figures. 
[00:04:30]  He's wearing a shirt. Doctor Who's shitting on a glass coffee table. Right. Taking pictures  like they're real people. Look, I'm here with Homer. Oh, you're not. It's plastic. Exactly.  To my knowledge, he's just with family. I don't think he's in Europe. Oh, wow. Then this  is even more mysterious. That's why I was like, who told you Europe? Someone's  giving you the, uh... I have an inside scoop to the Nagels, you know. Or maybe we were  told, family, to throw us off. Right. That's true. That's why I was looking at Travis and  did you hear Europe? Why does Nagel need to be so mysterious? Because then we're talking 
[00:05:00]  about him. See, he went on. I was told Europe. You're saying family. Maybe the whole family  went to Europe. No, we were told he was going home to Florida. Are you serious? Yeah.  No. Right? Yes. That's pretty cool, huh? That's where home is. I was told, uh, you  know, Europe. Where they eat. Holy shit. Where they like their, uh, their pasta. Oh, a little  Italy? I was told, uh, Italy. Oh, you know what? What? Now that you mention it, at some 
[00:05:30]  point, like a couple weeks ago, my wife was like, oh, I heard E-Rock was going to Italy.  And I was like, I don't know anything about that. What are you nuts? That's some wrong information.  Right. There's no posts on Facebook or Instagram or anything of pictures of him?  No, the consumer announced he was taking a week off. Yeah, but I mean, the consumer can  take a week off, but then does Nagel come back and go, ah, here's me by the Coliseum.  Right. And why wouldn't the consumer go, you know, abroad with his bit? There's a lot 
[00:06:00]  of great things to try in Italy. He could be like, mamma mia, look at this.  Now, he hasn't been posting on social media, perhaps because he does not have an international  data plan. Ah. He could do it from his computer. A computer. Ah, yeah. Is that reasonable?  From a computer he could do it. That international data plan. Instagram through a computer.  They really get you with that international data plan because you forget about it. Man, you  really start paying attention to that. You go away for a week and, you know, six months 
[00:06:30]  later, you're still paying for it. Your $900 bill, $1,000. I asked a lot of questions  because we went to Mexico recently, and I guess I'm on an international data plan for a whole  month, even though I was there for seven days. Yeah. Or at least I asked my questions to  make sure it was only going to be one billing cycle. Uh-huh. Why does it have to be one billing  cycle if you're only going for a week? Yeah, they love it. They love fucking like that.  They can easily figure that out, right? Yep. Why does it have to be a billing cycle? Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah. That's ripping off your customers. Of course. It's the way they make their cake.  Right. Uh, anything? What's that? No? This was posted while he's been gone. Right. What  is it? It's a, uh, Guy Fawkes mask. Right. It says, we are a legion. It says, we are a legion.  Where's that from? It's in English. Well, I mean, it could be from that movie. It could be  anonymous. That's true. It's our first clue, though. That is a clue. 
[00:07:30]  That's our first clue. That is a clue. I'm kind of insulted. I know, I know we've kind  of messed with him over the years, but I'm kind of insulted that he just kind of snuck  out. We got to track down the Nagel. How long has he been gone? There's our first clue.  Yep. I don't know. Middle of last week. It took us a day to even know he was gone. Wait,  did he leave? We were in school for Thursday. I really don't know what day he left. I think  it's Thursday. I think it's Thursday to Thursday is his trip. Why Thursday to Thursday? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know. When you leave on a Thursday, come back on a Sunday, so you squeeze a couple  of the days. He's back on Friday. We've all done that.  Okay. And in a place that's shaped like a boat. Yeah, do you know where I am? I'm the Nagel  town.  All right, we got our first clue. I think it's Italy. He's not going to be able to help  himself and he'll have a picture of the Colosseum or something. Oh, he'll have a picture of 
[00:08:30]  him like eating. He's trying so hard to make, you know. He would tell us if it was Italy  though because we couldn't get a hold of him there. He probably knows we can't get a hold  of him in Italy or Europe. He doesn't give a shit if we can't get a hold of him. Right.  Yeah. He loves the fact that we can't get a hold of him. Yeah, you'd think he would  say, well, I'm going to Italy. Although at this point he probably thinks we would be able  to track him down in some way, shape or form. Right. Why don't you call him? I guess we 
[00:09:00]  can call him. No. No. We should give him a call and see how he's doing. See if his phone  answers. He might be in England and right now it's six hours, so it's probably about noon  there. See if it picks up. Yeah, it's almost four o'clock in the afternoon. Let's call  him. I will get blamed for this for whatever reason. I will. Right. Hello. Eric Nagel  here. Hello. Just out here at Piccadilly Circus. Who's calling him? I'll call him. Hang 
[00:09:30]  on. All right. I love this nonsense with Nagel. Our Nagel kid. But he does it to himself.  He's so mysterious where you have to wonder. Always. Vague and mysterious. Like if anyone  else around here said, hey man, you know, I'm taking my summer. You know, we all get  vacation. Oh, where are you going? I'm going to Italy. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. I'll see you 
[00:10:00]  guys in about a week. All right. Enjoy yourself. But with him, he sneaks out. We have to go,  where's Eric today? And people actually actually tell us, oh, he's on vacation. Oh, really?  Where'd he go? No one knows. What the fuck is he? A secret agent? And then on top of it,  you know, someone told someone very close to me not to tell me where he's going. I'm like,  oh, like that was going to happen. That's silly. Isn't it? I have open dialogue. I actually 
[00:10:30]  have open dialogue with the people around me. He was eager from you. Right. Not from  me, from people very close to me. And he assumes like they're not going to tell me. That's  what I mean. Like why would those people not talk to you? Maybe because he lives very mysteriously  or something. I don't know. He's a sneaky Pete. Yes. I think he's sneaky. I just tried  to call him. And? It rang twice, made a weird noise, and then went to voicemail. A weird  noise. Yeah. Like a noise that wouldn't, like. A very international sounding noise, perhaps? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah. And then there was a little bit of like static. Right. Like somebody would pick up when  they're like driving and there's a lot of wind. Uh-huh. But then it went to voicemail.  Clue two. Weird noise. Weird noise. A mysterious galop. Did it have an Italian accent? Ah. But  I just hope he understands like he does this to himself because he's so mysterious with  things. If he would have just told us, we would have went like, all right, make sure 
[00:11:30]  your phone's off so we don't fuck with you. I don't know. Something like that. Well, he  knows we would attract the hotel. He's worried the hotel would have been. He had to put a block  on his phone and he'd forget. And he'd be dozing off after eating some Jell-O at five  in the morning. Some gelato. And then he leaves Thursday to Thursday. Who does that?  Nagel. You start your vacation on a Thursday so you could squeeze an extra day or two.  Yeah. But he also lies. Now it's a nine or ten day vacation. Well, he's back on Thursday.  No, no, no. He's back on Thursday. He's not coming in that Thursday. He did the same. 
[00:12:00]  He did that. Thursday to Thursday. He's coming in on Friday, though. He's coming in on Friday.  No, he's back on Thursday. Oh, he is. Okay. I said we're off on Friday. Yeah, he'll be  here on Thursday. Oh. But he lied. Like, he told all of us he's going to Florida. Yeah.  Like, he specifically said, right? Didn't he say, I'm going to Florida? Because Travis  asked him. No, he's in Italy. You know what? He's in Italy. Travis asked him. So he did  this to everybody. He said, are you going to Disney World? Right. And Iraq said, no, I'm not  going to make it this time. And Travis said, not even for a day? No, I'm not going to 
[00:12:30]  make it. Because he's in Italy. It's so fucking far from Italy. That's why. He  thinks he's in the Epcot. So he told you guys Florida. Yes. And didn't even tell us  he's going away. Yes. Because he figured it would take us a day or two to, you know,  realize. This is very mysterious. What's the problem? Well, I understand to a point. There's  got to be a way to definitively find out where he is. We've got a couple clues so 
[00:13:00]  far. Jesus Christ. Some people say they think he's in Germany. When did he leave? He left  Thursday? Yeah, Wednesday was his last time. Did anyone at the airport see one of those  planes where the nose lifts up and they load the car going? Where was that headed?  Good. Let's say hi to Nate in Philly. Nate. You know, the man does fancy himself as quite  a goulash consumer. I'm thinking he's over in Vivalia, Germany. 
[00:13:30]  Hmm. Maybe if, maybe we should have a contest. Like, it's a little hacky, I understand, but  where's. Where in the world is. E-Rock. Is E-Rock Nagel. Right. Let's say. Where in the  world is. E-Rock Nagel. E-Rock. Where's Fatso Santiago?  Far-sized Santiago. My mother thought that was such a cool computer game, Carmen Santiago. 
[00:14:00]  Ew. I didn't know. No. Dan in Pennsylvania. Dan. Dan. Oh, yeah. I know where E-Rock  is. He's at the craft factory consuming. The craft factory. I don't remember where that  is. Sam, are you guys insulted that he told you Florida? Because you guys aren't even  part of it. He threw you off his scent. Yeah. Like, because it's not even, like, he lied.  He didn't even, it's not even being sneaky or, like, forgetting to mention. Like, he'll  come back and be like, no, well, I went to Florida, and then we went to Italy. Yeah, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Really? Like, going to Italy, that's a big deal. That's sort of one of those once-in-a-lifetime.  That's a big trip right there. He's telling everyone Florida. And he can't, why does he  feel compelled to not tell us? Uh, let's go to Tommy in Indiana. Tommy?  All right, what do you mean, what do you mean, why not tell you? Hell, last time he was on  vacation, I'd be mysterious, too. You gave his damn phone number out to every one of us  idiots. Yeah. That truly was by accident. We've never fully come back from that one, by the 
[00:15:00]  way. Yeah, that was a biggie. Yeah. We understand why he might be a little, a little gun-shy, but,  you know. I understand why he would. But to tell everyone, and, you know, he's going to  Florida, and not tell us that he's even on vacation.  All right. Well, more to come. That's right. See if we can figure this one out. We're going 
[00:15:30]  to try and call him again. Right now? Yeah. Give another call, see what happens, see if you  get that sound. Yeah. Very mysterious. Should we do it on the air? Probably not. Oh, my God.  Well, we might be able to get a little clue as to the sound. Yeah, just give us all the  clues, Travis. It doesn't go to voicemail, right? No, it did go to voicemail after the  mysterious sound. And does he say his number right away? No, it just says, you know, it's  one of those. All right, we could do that then. Right? Well, they'll be able to tell us 
[00:16:00]  what's going on. Yeah, I want to hear. We'll have a fail-safe this time. I want to hear  that strange sound. Right. When Travis is getting some intel. Oh. Hmm. Oh, there's  no way. All right. Our intern, Adrian, just called and it did the same thing. It sounds  like somebody's picking up and then it just goes straight to voicemail. Very weird.  All right. Yeah, he's got to be overseas. Oh, he told the secret agent. He told the boys 
[00:16:30]  Florida. Yeah. Florida. What a liar. Now that I think about it, when I asked him where  he was going and he told me, he didn't say it with all that much confidence. No, huh?  Like, oh, I'm just going down to Florida. He was like, um, just Florida. Just Florida.  All right. All right. Well, we got a couple clues. Let's get the Iraq update. Oh, please. 
[00:17:00]  I need to know. I will say the staff has been doing a great job. Everybody here. Investigating?  The team has been doing a great job of compiling information. It's great. What do we know so  far? Well, we started, first, you guys did not know, um, that Iraq was even gone. That's  never, by the way, a good sign as an employee. When someone has to say so-and-so is gone  and your response is, really? Really? No. We had no idea. So as it turns out, he left 
[00:17:30]  after Wednesday's show to go on vacation. Without telling... Without telling you guys.  Oh, yeah. The talent, as you're not. Right. But then some would say they understand why  Iraq didn't tell us. Because the last... It's gone bad a few times in the past. The  last two times he's gone on... What are some of the things we've done to  Iraq while he's been on vacation over the years? We called him in the morning. Well, there  was one time when you gave... The whale noises for 20 minutes was funny. Just talk to him  in whale noises. Yeah. The whale noises, you called him on his honeymoon. In Honolulu, 
[00:18:00]  right? In Florida? Uh, Hawaii? No, it wasn't Hawaii, because I was in Hawaii. You... I think  he was in... Atlantis. Atlantis. And, yes. So he was in Atlantis, and you made whale noises,  and then... Well, because... First of all, it was Anthony. You guys. I don't feel like getting  blamed for everything all the time. No, the collective you made whale noises. That one was Anthony,  and the reason was, he was on the phone but refused to talk to us, so Ant figured, well, if I  talked to him in his native tongue, maybe he'll respond. That was it. And I just did the... I just 
[00:18:30]  did, like, the Caribbean lady. Right. Noticing that the man's ice cream bowl was empty. Right.  The bowl was empty. I don't remember the thing, but... That's right. Oh, is that funny? And then,  as it turns out, the listeners were able to figure out what hotel he was staying at. Yeah. Because  you decided, Anthony, to not blow his cover by saying he was staying at Fat Lantis. Fat Lantis, yes.  I didn't think anyone would catch on. Right. Oh, you know why he didn't want anyone to know?  Because we would say it, and they would call every hotel in the area, and everyone. Right. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah. Somebody would... Yeah, I don't blame him. What were some of the other ones before  we mentioned the big one again? Was there any other ones? Well, I mean, you've made a habit.  You've literally called him every single time. He's been gone for one day, and you just call  him to see what the update is. At home, we call him if he's not feeling well. Right. Get up,  slob. What? When he can't get in because there's a twig in front of his truck. Exactly. I was one of my  favorites ever. Oh, I love that one. Anyone else could have easily maneuvered around that 
[00:19:30]  branch. Oh, God. Easily. No, exactly. Taking forced perspective pictures of it to try to  throw us off. Right. Look at how big it is. Like, there's an ant next to it. Yes, a giant  ant is next to it, too. Wow. Assuming that none of us ever been to his house where we know  all the roads, because he's trying to tell us he couldn't go this one road. Oh, that's the  main road. We had Google Maps up and photographic evidence of the site. We are just assholes.  Oh, God. Do I love Iraq? Yeah. He's trying to find little ways to shirk his responsibility. 
[00:20:00]  Yes. He was. A little shirking. Yeah. But we have three, I feel, pertinent pieces of information  as to where is Iraq right now. Fallen buildings like in Cloverfield. Of course, we gave out  his phone number the last four I did. Yes, you did. You did that one. That was completely  by accident. Whoops. But funny. For real. Whoops-a-daisy. I actually, I felt really bad about that one. 
[00:20:30]  That was really stupid. Oh, you remember, Iraq came in with his bill for his inconvenience  and he just wanted $15,000. Did he get it? No, he certainly didn't. He got a bunch  of pennies and more humiliation. I paid him what was fair. In what? Quarters. Yeah. I was  waiting quarters. I thought that was more than fair. How many quarters was it? I don't  know anymore. I forget. Your bag of shells. Do you want to find out what the three pieces  of info are? Yes. Well, so, yeah. What we know. So we know he's on vacation. Right. Well, now 
[00:21:00]  we know. Now we know. At first, we didn't know he was on vacation. Now we know he's  on vacation. We actually figured it out when we asked the other day where he was and someone  said he's on vacation. Yeah. Then, come to find out that there is some who believe he's  in Italy right now. Uh-huh. But he told his creative partners, the staff of the show, who  we all trust each other, that he was in Florida. Right. And this is why we do this. He does  it to himself. Oh. No. Especially because he probably thinks still. Bin Laden. Bin Laden. 
[00:21:30]  Bin Laden. Tun Laden. I could say it. I could. I could say it ten times to him that I didn't  do it on purpose, the phone number, which I truly did not. But he doesn't. It doesn't  sink in with him. No, he doesn't understand that. Because he's safe this vacation because  of what happened. Right. So if he just said, hey, man, I'm going to Italy for a week. I'll  see you guys in a week. Right. We'd be like, all right, cool. And turn off your phone. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah. We'd goof about it a little bit, maybe, but. But this is way worse now. We wouldn't  spend this much time. Yes, thank you. Like, never. There'd be not this much to talk about.  No. We'd all call around, oh, he's in the Hotel Antipasta, whoever he fucking is in Italy.  So, I was insulted because I know that he was trying to make sure that I did not find out  he was going to Italy. Right. But the person he told is kind of close to me. Uh-oh. As  it turns out, somebody close to me was told the same information. Oh. Oh, is that what 
[00:22:30]  you're finding out? That's not the main piece of info. Wait, so. But there's no dates on  it. I'm saying the person. So, basically, our wives were told that we're in Italy. Yeah,  a hundred percent. But then Iraq turns around and tells you that he's going to Florida and  he doesn't expect you to talk to your wife. Yeah, because my wife found out that he's  going to Italy in the general sense. So, I guess I assumed this was two trips because  why would somebody. Francisco Franco? General? No. No. Why would somebody lie to me? Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  You know? Like, why would they say, no, I'm going to Florida when it's not. You're in the same  country. I don't know. But we have more info now? Yeah. So, the first piece. That brought  everyone up to speed pretty much, right? Yes. Okay, good. The first pertinent piece is  Travis's information that he read on the email. Travis sees the floor. Wait, no. We have  other info. The one photo he Instagrammed. Right. Well, yeah. We have very, very shady 
[00:23:30]  stuff. He's not Facebooking. He's tweeting. Not consuming. Well, he's consuming, but he's  not documenting his consuming at this time. And there's one Instagram photo of a Guy  Fox mask. But there doesn't appear to be a lot of network connectivity. Uh-huh. And  then Travis called and it seemed like someone might have picked up and hung up. No. Nobody's  picking up and hanging up. It's just a very weird transition to voicemail. Okay. Yeah.  So, there might be some kind of international thing happening. What I also noticed, and it 
[00:24:00]  didn't strike me until we started talking about all of this international stuff, is that on his  out-of-office reply for the email? It's in French. I will have limited access to phone  slash email. Oh. That could be to throw us off the trail, though. He never writes that  he will have limited phone. Exactly. But maybe his wife finally said, hey, stupid, why don't  you write we'll have limited access? And he went, okay. Yeah. He's called access A-X-E-S.  He said, he's probably right under our noses. Limited access A-X-E-S. He's probably vacationing 
[00:24:30]  in Times Square. I figure that's the safest place. Yeah. He's eating Del Frisco's every  night. He's right under our noses. All right. So, we got that as a clue. All right. That  information coupled with the information that Sal obtained. Sal, the information I'm referring  to is about movies and a tablet. Yeah. Oh. So, the other day, Roland was, you know, kind  enough to give Iraq a chance to get, like, a major discount on a tablet. And he's been 
[00:25:00]  going on and on about this fucking tablet for months now. What was the tablet? I don't  even... If Iraq can't vomit, it would help his stomach. Of course. A surface? I don't  even know what it is. But, like, he was going on, like, yeah, I'm going traveling for a  bit. I want to make sure, you know, I have this. Like, if it's really fucking official.  Business or something like that. He just wants to watch movies. And, um, so, Roland's  like, oh, here's a time and place you can go. I think this was approximately Tuesday or  Wednesday of last week. And Iraq was like, no, can't go. Roland's like, I got you the 
[00:25:30]  hookup. Just go there. They'll take care of you. Blah, blah, blah, whatever. Iraq's  like, no, I'm too busy packing. Blah, blah, blah, sort of shit. Whatever. Iraq comes in  on Wednesday. He has his laptop with him. His, like, his personal laptop. And he keeps on  asking me, like, what are some good movies to watch? And I'm like, you know, I'm giving  him a couple here and there. And he explicitly said he had an exuberant amount of time on  the flight to watch multiple movies. All right. That's the information. That's not a flight  to Florida. All right. That's, yeah. Florida could squeeze in. Oh. And he was also asking 
[00:26:00]  about, like, a series he could star and stuff like that. Oh, boy. Yeah, I think. That's  a longer flight than Florida. Right. Now, those two pieces of information. Yes. Joined by the  smoking gun, I feel like. Oh, what is this? Our new intern, Carrie Ann, brought this to  my attention. Uh-huh. Which one is she? Uh. Is she? Should we have her tell us? We should  hear her from the, uh. Which one is she? The one that comes in here more than the other 
[00:26:30]  one? She's the one who's about to come in. With the glasses or no? Yeah, she has glasses.  Oh, okay. She remembered a piece of information. Oh, this girl. Okay. Oh, office girl. Yes.  Yeah, she looks like a girl from the office. Yes. Hello. Hi. You sweating today? Yeah, a little.  Why? Sorry. I don't know. I'm nervous. Why are you nervous? I don't know. I'm too nervous.  Why? You know. She pointed out to people as soon as they walk in. Yeah. It's rude.  Why? How could you tell she was sweating? Her left arm. Yeah. Let me see. Oh, no, you 
[00:27:00]  pit. No, I don't want to show it now. Oh, she's pitting out a little bit. It's all right.  But she's got a very. It happens to everyone. It sure does. She's got a very light, summery  shirt on. Yeah, but no, it's kind of thick, actually. Not a hint. Not a hint of a sleeve when you're sweating  from fuselands. Yeah, it's air conditioned in there. Oh, man. It's not that bad.  It's just because it's a green shirt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, that's fine. Nothing  wrong with that at all. It's cool. Jeez, Sophie, you bring it up. Yeah. It's okay. It's  noticeable. Exactly. I've seen plenty of people coming off heroin. It happens. Yeah, it's 
[00:27:30]  nice and cool in here. What's going on with you? Delightful temperature. Right. You should  run around like a maniac. Are we allowed to say you're cute? I don't know if we're allowed  to do that these days. We used to be able to say shit. Yeah. Very cute. Thanks. Because  I don't want people to think you're some slob that's just sweating in front of us. No, we're  just talking about him. The fact is that you're cute and sweating makes it kind of funnier, 
[00:28:00]  I think. Anyway, go ahead. What did you find out? So on Wednesday after the show, we were  sitting in the office, and Don got us pizza, and we were sitting there, and as Eric was  leaving, he said, ciao. Oh! That's a good listener. Oh, no, he probably meant what he was going  to get. Right. That's his natural reaction. Yes. You sure he didn't say cow and Ima before 
[00:28:30]  it. Or someone said, work hard, and he said, how? I don't know if the pizza just got him  in like the Italian need, but. Maybe, yeah. Or someone said, what do you think you are?  And he said, sal. Sal. Or what should you be pulling, plow? I don't know, I was trying  on Eric's thing. Wait, did you kill yourself? He said, now. Oh, shit. Oh, ciao. Ciao, Bella. 
[00:29:00]  And, uh, oh, boy. He's in Italy. So I thought he was in Italy, but then I heard he was in  Canada, so that. Canada? I heard he was in Canada. From who? From who? He's all over  the place. So maybe he, maybe the Italy thing with the people close to us was to throw us  off as well. But then why did he? Maybe it's not a guarantee he's in Italy. He didn't do  it, and like, he just kind of just said it. I don't even think he knew anyone was listening.  Someone Twittered, I'm an American hiding in Italy. My name is Eric Nagel. There's a lot 
[00:29:30]  of people who would pay a lot of money for that information. Except your daughter would  lose her father, instead of you gaining a ton. All right, the mystery continues. I feel  like that is a big piece of evidence. The child part. Oh, very good. Oh, I see a little  sweating. Hey, could you lift more cinder blocks? All right. It is so mean. What? That's 
[00:30:00]  hilarious. She's probably so self-conscious of it, and then you just blurt it out. Yeah,  she should be sitting right now on a brick wall and drinking a container of coffee with  a hard hat on. Right. Working hard, hardly working. Oh, boy. What the hell is she doing?  She's sweating so bad. She's working hard. All right, so we add that to the, uh, the  mystery. Yeah. All right, so we got, uh, chow. Chow. And no, no, no hiding her hair  from him about, uh, where he is. No pictures. He's not smart enough. Why wouldn't he give 
[00:30:30]  me, like, a fake place to not tell me? Maybe he did. Maybe he did. He's not smart enough.  Florida. Well, we don't know where he is. This kid is in Italy. I have no doubt in my mind.  Yeah. He's not in Florida, that's for sure. Like, he told you guys who he's closest with.  What cow? Yeah. But yeah, I, I sent him a text a few hours ago. Right. Has not been  read. Which makes me think. Well, what time is it? What time is it if it was? Is it feeding  time in Italy? Well, if it's in Florida, then it's early. Sure. You should have read it by 
[00:31:00]  now. But Italy, that's gotta be, I would imagine it's kinda like. It's three o'clock in Italy.  Yeah. Florida, there's no disruption in your fucking phone service. Nope. Email or anything.  It's, it's exactly like if you were here. Right. So for him to say limited access to  that, that, the red flag. And ciao. And ciao. All right, ciao. Oh boy. And going over  the movies, how many movies do you really need to fly to Florida? What? Florida. It's like 
[00:31:30]  a two hour flight? Three. Yeah, by the time the plane gets up in the air, you know, you're  not fucking watching that goddamn movie. You can watch one movie. Maybe. Done. I don't know if  I should call him. I'm curious as to what the ring sounds like. Give him a call. Yeah.  Give him a call. I want to hear what that ring sounds like. His voicemail does not have  his phone number on it, so. No, no, no. Okay. So, so let's hear what that, what that ring  sounds like. Give him a ring-a-ding. Let me give him a jingle. Give, uh, you know, give  him a jingle. Okay, let's see. I'll help. Listen. One ring. Here we go. 
[00:32:00]  Did you hear that? Just voicemail. Right to voicemail. Yeah, but it's an odd sound before  that. Yeah, it's probably just his. He's probably just incompetent and didn't do it  right. Yeah, but no, no phone just dumps to voicemail after two rings. Two rings. Two rings  in a weird. Oh, man. That's international. That's some international shit going down.  Yep.

[00:37:00]  Zopi and Anthony's best of the week. Right now, silence should play.  Pat Monaghan from Train, of course, our good friend. I saw him in the hallway last week. I said,  hey, man, when are you going to do our show? And then he said, I'll be back in New York and I'll  come in and do your show. See you up to. What's up, Pat? How you doing, Pat? Take a seat over there.  I love the Jaws hat. Everyone. Where'd you get the Jaws hat from? I got it in Maui. Nice. I've never 
[00:37:30]  seen a Jaws hat. Yeah, yeah. This is, uh, I don't know why I liked it so much. Right. My wife kind of  found it and I was like, I'll wear it. Yeah. How are you guys? It was good to see. We're pretty  hyper. It was good to see you guys last week and then I didn't get the chance to come in. So I  know. Again, for re-inviting me. Oh, no worries. I saw you coming out of the bathroom like, hey,  what are you doing here? No problem. Come on in and say hi. Oh, yeah. We were talking about  everything. Yeah. Are you into the World Cup? I'm really into it, but I have kids and they're 
[00:38:00]  little. So I chase them around while World Cup starts going on. Oh, is that it? Yeah.  Yeah, you can't. They're not very interested. Well, no. How old are your kids? Well, I have  a five-year-old and a two-year-old. Oh, you're right around the same as me. Yeah. So basically  you can't watch TV. No, no, no. I can't imagine that. You cannot watch TV. It would drive  me crazy if I couldn't watch television. I mean, you could watch TV, but it's going to take  at least twice the time. So, yeah. I was watching the finale of Game of Thrones the other 
[00:38:30]  day. How long is it on HBO? How long is it? An hour? It was about 75 minutes. 75 minutes  would be, I'm not even joking. That would probably be three hours with somebody with  young kids. My phone was on the armrest of the couch. Right. And during the show, it  went, bing, that a text came in. Right. And I'm like, what the fuck? Right. Like, I couldn't  imagine a kid running around interrupting. Well, first you got the little one, the littler 
[00:39:00]  one, you got to get her to bed. Oh, this is what you have to do to watch TV. You get  the little one to bed. She's good. You know she's out for the night. Okay. And I got to  set up the other one, mine's four, in another room with his TV show. And he's good. And you  get him a little, you even get him snacks and everything. But he'll come out about 20  times to say, one question. I got one question. It comes out, you got to pause everything.  He prefaces it with, I have one question? Because he's sort of aware that we're trying to watch 
[00:39:30]  something. But he'll do the, I got one question about, maybe not 20 times, but he'll do it.  Excuse me, sir. You should be like the president. I'm not taking any more questions. Thank you.  And then he runs back into his room and he's good for maybe 10 minutes. Then he comes back  because he has another one question. That's so amazing that he's aware of it. Because my  daughter is five and she'll come in and she's just like, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing.  Oh, really? Yeah. It's time for me to ask some stuff.  You will. I am the important thing here. Oh, it's my time. Plus I need to dance and sing 
[00:40:00]  four songs before I go back in. And then I just go like, forget it. We'll watch the movie when  she's 20. Right. You're just the oddest things. I don't, I couldn't imagine. It's quite a joy,  but it's also kind of frustrating. It's quite a joy. It's kind of frustrating at times.  Everybody that I know, though, is huge into Game of Thrones. Like, that's all I care about.  That's a big show. Seven million people watch the finale, the season finale. And then you add on the  replays and it was something like nine million viewers watching it. Yeah. And that's an HBO. 
[00:40:30]  It set a record for the most watched HBO show. I've always seen history. And they had the  Sopranos? Really? Yeah, I know. It's just, it just shows like what good fucking shows are  out there now. And, and, you know, it's like a movie. They've had a few shows between the  Sopranos and Game of Thrones as well. Very well too. They've never gone away this HBO. I'm into  also Boardwalk Empire. That whole thing is taking over movies. Isn't it? It's kind  of like you get a nine hour movie instead of a movie. Yeah. It's, I kind of like that 
[00:41:00]  too. You really get to develop characters and, uh, you know, you, you can kill off important  people without ruining the movie because it's, you know, it gives you time to build up another  character. I kind of like it. What's a movie? Exactly. And that's another thing. Are you  kidding me? Movies? If I go to a movie now, it's only IMAX 3D, like shit I cannot do at home  at some point. There really is a market to bring, you know, the real movies into your home. Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  First run. First run. There is such a market for, you know, for, for parents. I don't really care if  I see them right away though anymore because you're seeing them relatively soon after it was done.  I remember years ago, I've told this too, when I, I was, I saw a planet of the apes as a kid  in the movie theater. It was at the RKO in a Comac. Wow. And, um, and when, when mommy came to pick  me up, I was just thinking, how long is it going to be before I get to see that again? There was 
[00:42:00]  over a year. It was well over a year. It was like, it was like five years before television got some  kind of rights to big major motion pictures. I remember in general, it was over a year because  for the most part you were seeing a, like TV was playing old fifties horror movies, Godzilla,  Wolfman movies, things like that. And, uh, for a first run movie to, to premiere on television,  you was crazy. You had to go to the movie. You had to see the movie or you weren't, you know,  you weren't cool. Yes, you were a dick. So I want to get back to jaws and Maui. Do you surf? 
[00:42:30]  No, I, I mean, I can surf. I, when I lived in LA, I got up on the, you know, but my wife,  I choose not to. She's like, I hang out with people that are just so much better than I am at it.  That it just gets frustrating. Yeah. Oh, so your wife could surf. She, yeah, she can do everything  twice as fast, twice as good. No kidding. Yeah. It's a bummer, but I mean, you know,  but I love it about her. But you can sing pretty good. Yeah. That's, that's true. Yeah. I beat her 
[00:43:00]  in that category. But, uh, but I love going to Maui. It's kind of my, I'd love to just move there.  And everybody that I like run into, I ran into Todd Rundgren at the hotel in here in New York.  Todd Rundgren. He lives in Maui. Like most of those guys live in Maui now. Wow. Really?  Yeah. Like Crosby, Stills and Nash. They are all there. Seems like a good place to go and  kind of chill out. Get away from everything. Yeah, it really is. I've never been just  because the flight. You've never been to Maui. Never been to Hawaii or anywhere. See, but 
[00:43:30]  you guys, the flight's too long. From New York, you go to the Bahamas, right? Really? Yeah.  That's pretty much the way to go. I figured I saw the Brady Bunch episode, so I don't even  need to go. Yeah, no, that's a good, that's a good point. See, I know. Yeah. Cause then you'd  probably get a weird necklace. Yeah. I saw the whole thing. The tiki kind of scared me. What makes  it so cool? Are the people nice? Yeah, man. Obviously, the scenery. We've all seen the  pictures. Yeah, everything is really great about it. But I think all the islands, I love 
[00:44:00]  Kona. Hawaii is like my little place away from everything. It's the only place I can  actually relax. Right. Because when I'm home, I feel like I'm either doing kid stuff or stressing  about work. Right, yeah. But when I go to Maui or any island, it feels like, okay, you're  allowed this amount of time before you have to stress again. Right. Even if I'm taking  care of kid stuff, it's fun because we're in the water. That water's scary, though, because  it's so, like, there's so much nature in there. There's something to be said for growing up 
[00:44:30]  on Long Island beaches where you know, what are you going to do, step on a clamshell or,  you know, something giant and exotic isn't going to bite you. Right. Well, I mean, just about  everything is scared of you. I'm saying all that. Put all that to the people with bites.  My brother-in-law showed me a YouTube video yesterday about the guy in Australia. Have  you seen it? Yeah. Where he jumps in with the GoPro on his head? Yeah, I think that's  fake. Oh, you do? I do think that's fake. People's reaction. I don't think he'd be focusing 
[00:45:00]  so well on the shark and be that petrified. I think he'd be trying to get out of the water  as quickly as possible and not turning around, going back on the water with his head. Right.  And looking at the shark. You too, you think it's fake? I think it's fake. Oh, wow. There's  so many good CGI things and layering that's done now. I don't know. I'm so gullible, man.  You want to believe, and you got a Jaws head. I would have believed that if the shark had a GoPro 
[00:45:30]  on it. You put a fucking GoPro on a shark, man. This shit's real. Yeah. I heard it. That was  funny. And you got a Jaws head on. And you got a Jaws head on for the love of your head.  Man, I got this Jaws head after I saw the video and you're telling me it's fake.  Throw the hat now. A lot of people think it's real. I think it's fake, too. I don't know.  Yeah, it's just the way it looks good. I think in the beginning of the video, his friend looks  the wrong way, and that threw me off. Hey, over there. And then he's looking the other way. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like... And here's another thing. When you see real videos of things that happen that  are out of the ordinary, frightening, dangerous, they never look like that. They never come  off like that. They never catch it from beginning to end. It's always you wish they would have  focused better or moved the camera. It looks too good. Right. Yeah. That's a good point.  Like everything else is... It looks kind of like a GoPro commercial. Right. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Very good. It might be. Just get a GoPro hat. That'd be interesting. Dude. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah. Yeah. That's so smart, if it is. Yeah. You banked some money off a commercial. That  train song was everywhere for like a year straight. Oh, man. Especially in this area.  Drive by and with the Yankees games and everything. Yeah. Or the Ford commercials during the Yankee  games. Yeah. You guys were smothered in that song. Sorry about that. Does that pay well?  You don't have to give us numbers, but... You know, sometimes it pays the record company  really well. Oh, yeah. It's a good time for them to get their money back and everything. 
[00:47:00]  Right. But when you recoup the money that you're using from a record company, yeah, it ends up  meaning a lot. Yeah. That's good. If they could make their money back that way, and then you  guys can start actually making money off of a deal instead of paying back the man. I do  a podcast, and I've had a lot of musicians and pro athletes, etc. You know, I'm not good like  you guys are, but I faked through it, and one of the most interesting podcasts I did 
[00:47:30]  was two radio guys from Columbia Records. Right. Because I got to talk to them about what  it's going to be like for these kids coming in, and is there any future in record sales  or record companies? I don't think so. And, you know, they're very optimistic about it,  because they have great jobs. They work radio, and radio, they feel, is going to continue to  have to matter for a lot more years. But you guys make your money differently than,  you know, guys before you. We make our money in a lot of different ways, but touring is 
[00:48:00]  basically where you end up. And a lot of record companies did 360 deals with their artists  from, you know, signing probably 10 years ago to now that they make you give them part of  your t-shirts and tickets. Holy fuck! God, they're not getting enough? Well, no, they're  not, because they're... No, because the record companies are suffering, too, so they're trying  to figure out how to make their money. They're so hurting. Record companies are not what it  used to be. Well, Spotify's not helping you guys. A lot of people just... You know, but 
[00:48:30]  I don't know. It's kind of like iTunes. When iTunes came out, everybody wanted to kill  iTunes. Or, you know, when Napster came out, everybody wanted to kill that first. And now  it's like why we can get everything we want. You know, and I'm just as much a part of participant  in Spotify and loving it. And if that means that I get less money because I can listen to  every Paul Simon song and every new Irish band that I want in the world, I'm cool with that. 
[00:49:00]  When you're sitting around, though, and you think of a band and an album that you want  and you can instantly buy that album off of iTunes, I would think that helps at least the  record company, doesn't it? I mean, they're making... Yeah, but a lot of kids aren't buying  them anymore. That's the problem. They're subscribing, so they're not really spending that much money  on their music. Yeah, and there's a lot more ways to pull funds for a record company now.  So Spotify and all of those, you know, Pandora, they have to pay. 
[00:49:30]  Right. They have to pay.  They have to pay. There's got to be somebody who gets paid.  But the artist seems to be the one that really is at the bottom of the totem pole getting fucked.  Yeah, we always have been. And I'm not going to complain because I've, you know, I've done  fine by just working hard through all of it. But like, if I would have, if we would have  had one successful record and then I would have quit the music business, I would certainly  need a job. A little job on the side. A real job. 
[00:50:00]  No. You guys got a good run going, man. Jeez.  So far, man. You know, I don't know how long this lasts, you know? I just...  How many years have you guys been doing it now?  20 years. It is, right? Wow.  Yeah. That's what we're up to. Yeah, yeah.  20-year mark, man. 20 years.  Yeah. It's nuts. You look at each other and you go like, what happened to you? You look like  shit, right? And they're thinking the same thing.  Man, 20 years did not treat you well at all. Some fucking business. 
[00:50:30]  You've been around long enough to see some drastic changes in our business. You've been  long enough to see drastic changes in yours, certainly. Yeah.  Yeah, the way things are delivered, digital delivery now, even in our job, too. The amount  of anybody doing a podcast as opposed to, you know, just the few radio stations with shots  that talk. Well, we take it for granted now, but when we started, you wanted to be really  big in the city you were in. Right. And then, if you were lucky, they might syndicate you 
[00:51:00]  to, what, like, one more city maybe. One more city, yeah. Fast forward, we're taking this  for granted. Like, people right now are hearing us in L.A. and everywhere in between.  Right. And then online, they're listening, you know, we get calls. I'm in L.A.  Yeah, we got small pockets of fans around the world, too. To me, here's what the best part  about today is, as opposed to when we all started. I can leave here and go to Twitter and read  all of the, hey, asshole from Train, I heard you on Opie and Anthony. I think you suck. 
[00:51:30]  And that's great for me, because I can just see that instantly, instead of have to wait.  Right. Right. And get a letter. Right. You know. A letter. Instant. I hope my letter finds you well.  Instant abuse. Yay. We're all so lucky. I cannot say I enjoyed your appearance. Like written in oldie  Civil War speak. I can't believe people used to have to pen that out. Yeah. Man, I love 
[00:52:00]  that. I love it, too. That's a great, like, new Twitter vibe. Yeah, yeah. Like, you should  be that guy on Twitter. Just be the old Civil War letter guy. I hope this letter finds you  well. But Delia has succumbed to consumption. As I was listening to my... Oh, these assholes  will go, you know, the first three hours are good. Yeah. Then there was about 15 minutes 
[00:52:30]  there that I didn't like at all. Here's my favorite. Here's my favorite. You fucking dudes  totally lost touch with your fans. You don't even know what we want anymore. Oh, you get  that, too? And then, and then, P.S., I'll see you guys tomorrow. Right. Oh, fuck. That's  my favorite thing to read. Like, when I read other people's hate on other things, like, it's  always like you lost touch. It's amazing. If you guys ever get the, hey, man, you sold  out. Oh, of course. Sold out. But I just read one the other day that was like, it's 
[00:53:00]  official. The band that wrote, uh, Meet Virginia and Drops to Jupiter is dead.  You, and I'm like, oh, that's sweet. All right. Thanks. So I did this thing. I do this thing  on Twitter now where if somebody writes something, you know, like, for instance, this is what happened  last week, literally. Some guy wrote, Train's new album coming out is called, I don't know  how he got this many letters on Twitter, uh, it's called, uh, Bulletproof Picasso. I like 
[00:53:30]  the original name. Train is a shit in a Barnes and Noble toilet. So because it was a funny  enough tweet, I was like, hey, I know what I'll do. All right. I'll retweet, but I'll change  a couple of the words where I turned it into train. Uh, I liked the original title. Train  is awesome. Right. And then I just wrote, thanks buddy. So that all of our fans are seeing  this. And then he writes, oh my God, train just made me look like a total asshole to my 
[00:54:00]  friends. So it's like my new thing I'm going to do. It's just a lot of fun. I sit in bed  and just laugh. He can't possibly reach as many people anyway. No. And he was like, you won  this round. I'm pretty sure I'm never going to get you next time. I think you're done  with him. You're not going to be searching him out every time. That's funny. Wow. What  a Spinal Tap type review that was. Shark sandwich. A simple two word review. Shit sandwich.  Right. Right. Yeah. That's right. Oh fuck. What are you doing in New York? Uh, I'm here 
[00:54:30]  to, uh, we're going to have this really great girl from the UK sing on a track today so we  can be done with the album and then we're going to master the album on Friday. Oh, so  it's coming out soon. Well, the album will come out on, uh, the 16th of September. Right.  That's, you know, that's soon enough. But the single, uh, just, it's a week old. And where'd  you, where'd you find the, uh, the Goyle? You know, through my managers. Yeah. She's really, 
[00:55:00]  uh, I think she's, her name is Marsha. Uh, I can't remember how to spell her last name. So  I'm just going to keep it to Marsha. Marsha. She's, she's really a great singer. Cool. Well, yeah,  we'll play the, uh, the single. Hell yeah. In a little bit. Oh, hell yeah. Hey. What  are you guys doing in New York? A little of this. Rotting. A little of this. All our  friends get to travel the world and they come back and see us. We just sit here and rot  every day. That is true. Once a year they allow us to go broadcast somewhere else. No, no 
[00:55:30]  Jim today, huh? No, Jimmy Norton. Jimmy's still on his TV show for Vice. Oh, nice. He's doing  a show for Vice, so. Oh, that's great. He'll be back either. He hustles, man. He's a hustler.  A lot of those dudes hustle. Oh, yeah. You gotta hustle. Crazy. He's constantly working. We  don't hustle. You think it would have been easy for you guys to just do, like, stand-up  or, uh. No, man. I mean, it's all brutal, right? No. No, yeah. We, that's frightening  stuff. We could get in front of an audience and do a few little things here and there, but 
[00:56:00]  no, I respect those guys for what they do. They, the way they talk about bombing is astounding  to me. It's like, how can you make fun of it and be like, oh, yeah, so then I went there.  Oh, God, I bombed. The crowd was, like, how are you not, like, hiding a year later and still  just saying I'm not ever going to do that again? Yeah, no, it's a crazy, I just, I was at  a radio station in New Jersey the other day and I was like, man, you know, you remind me 
[00:56:30]  of Doug Stanhope. He's my favorite comic because he's so dark. And this guy's like, man, I  know Doug. I used to do stand-up with him. And so we started rapping about this thing  that, like, these salty, you know, comics, they do, and I'm sure Jim plays this game  too. It's called The Walking Game. You know about it? No, I don't. Where they just go,  like, all right, we're in Tulsa. There's 30 people. We're four comics. Let's see who can  make more people leave. Oh, shit. Nice. Walking Game. Walk the room. Right, right, 
[00:57:00]  right. Walk the room. Yeah, those guys do that. Yeah. That's brutal. They certainly  have versions of that. Yeah, you just start saying shit that nobody wants here, not even  you. It's odd because there's got to be a confidence in your material to go up there  every day and know that even if you bomb, the material's still good. Go up and do it  again. Yet they're the most unconfident people when they're just hanging out, comics. They're 
[00:57:30]  fucking weirdos for the most part. They're extremely strange. Yeah. I tell the story  about Jimmy. When we were off the air, I wandered around with him a little bit, and he was doing  sets in the city. And he did a set somewhere, I forget exactly, and he killed it. I mean,  almost like a standing ovation, but they, you know, didn't feel like standing, whatever.  And then he went to do another spot. This is what these guys do. They'll do six in a night,  no problem. So he goes to Dangerfields on the east side, does the exact same, I mean,  exact, because he's working on material for a CD at the time. He didn't get one laugh. 
[00:58:00]  I'm like, that's fucked up. Isn't that weird? Maybe not one laugh, but I mean, it was a  completely different reaction for the same exact material. I mean, that just sounds like  a terrible existence. There's no rhyme or reason to that. I don't know. How do you then  gain confidence for what you just did? When it's like, what is it? Is it soccer? Is it  great? What the fuck?  Yeah.  It was so strange.  I mean, you know, most musicians, we're all touched by something crazy weird, too. I don't 
[00:58:30]  know. Like, I think we all, well, at least I spend most of my time, like, trying to douse  the self-loathing flame, you know, just like to get enough courage to do it again for the  day, you know. Right. One of the hardest things for a musician is recording, because you hear  that song so many times, and something that you loved at the beginning becomes like, I 
[00:59:00]  don't even know if this is good or shit or what the fuck it is.  Yeah, are you a musician?  Yeah, I try.  Because, I mean, that makes all the sense in the world.  Yeah, you sit there over and over and over again, and you're like, I don't know. I loved  this song when it was first. And then it's on the radio, and then you go like, oh, man,  this thing's never going to go. I mean, I heard it on the radio that there's no way people  are going to like this song.  We suck. That guy on Twitter was right.  I've got to call him. 
[00:59:30]  At that point, you've got to promote the new song, but you just don't feel it the same  way anymore. There's no way you could feel it the same way.  Right. Yeah, it's got to be that way, too, for actors, because they're promoting movies  that they finished a year ago, sometimes more than a year ago, and now you're promoting  going, I don't know, was it good?  Right, they're on to their next project, but they have to go backwards and go, wait, oh,  that's right, I've got to push this thing now.  It's such an odd existence.  But see, most actors, they don't act. Like, most actors are schlepping dishes and like, 
[01:00:00]  well, that's true, yeah, yeah.  That's the worst job of all time.  Right.  Because even when you get a break, it's only a break for a second, and then you've got  another break you need real bad, because rent's due.  That's a tough gig.  Dancers, man, think about it. Dancers make like 300 bucks a year.  It's a terrible gig, but they're so gifted.  Entertaining. You're lucky to get anywhere in any of it. 
[01:00:30]  You know, when you could just sit there and build a birdhouse, maybe, see what you just  built, put a price tag on it and sell it. At least you know you could build another birdhouse.  It is such a, it's a business that it's all about, like, me, me, me.  Yeah.  Look at me!  It is, it really is.  It's really kind of sad and pathetic when you think about it.  It's sad and pathetic. I quit. 
[01:01:00]  I quit. I'm done.  Building a birdhouse.  What would you do if you weren't doing music?  I don't know.  Open a haberdashery?  That's exactly...  That's my next type of guy.  I think that's the answer to have, by the way.  To what?  To not know.  Yeah.  Because I think it makes you really, like...  Yeah, I don't know, man.  If you have nothing to fall back on, I don't know, I think that kind of helps...  No safety net?  What about you guys?  It helps push you forward.  I did it the other way around. I had a good, like, well, not a good job. It was a shitty job.  It was a real job for so long that it was, you know... 
[01:01:30]  What was it?  The sheet metal work, tin knocking, installation of duct work and giant air conditioning units.  You make it sound like it's really cool.  It sucked.  It was so bad.  Because, you know, you work in winter and summer, and you're the one putting in the stuff that keeps you either cool or hot.  Right.  So you're either freezing or burning up as you're working.  That sucked.  You're constantly cutting yourself on giant razor blades, for the most part, is what you're working on. 
[01:02:00]  And it's loud.  And it didn't pay well.  Yeah, that sounds...  I'm surprised you left that.  That sounds...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a real decision I had to make when Opie came through with the first gig.  Did you have anything that you could have fallen back on?  I could be a caddy still, probably.  A caddy?  That's the only other job I've ever had.  Do you play golf?  Yeah, I used to be all right.  Yeah?  Now if I break 100, I'm happy.  Really?  Which I'll do pretty much every time out.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't need to, you know, to hit the number anymore. 
[01:02:30]  I want to play more golf.  Do you?  Yeah, man.  Golf's great.  I just like a good game.  I golf.  Golf is awesome.  I love it.  I just don't get out there anymore.  I break 100 each time, too.  But I want to beat somebody.  With a claw?  With a claw.  First, I want to beat them in the score.  And then I want to beat them.  Put the shit on with a 3-1.  If I break 90, I'm really happy these days.  Yeah, if you're playing a real course and you break 90, you play good golf. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I'm happy with that.  Because, I mean, 90 is bogey golf, right?  So you're getting a few pars in there.  Actually, nowadays, if I go out, if I just get a few birdie putts and a few pars, I'm happy.  That's it.  I'm happy.  I'm just happy.  It's cool.  Whatever.  It's cool.  You can find joy in that.  Yeah, I like being...  Well, I'll still throw a club or two.  If I'm out there and the beer cart comes around more than a few times, I'm happy.  You're happy.  That's all I care about.  I'm happy.  Attractive girl in the beer cart. 
[01:03:30]  I'm happy.  I loved caddying, though.  I did that for like 10 years.  Now winning that caddy tournament.  10 years of caddying.  Yeah.  I started at like 12, 13 years old, though.  But did you caddy for anybody who is a real player?  Yeah.  I caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club, which is a club out on Long Island.  And yeah, we had some scratch golfers out there.  And so after 10 years, you were really caddying them.  You were telling them what club to use.  I knew every inch of the course.  I was handing them clubs.  Guys that were way better than me, but I'm like, here. 
[01:04:00]  I just...  Without even thinking.  Wow, that's cool.  I could look at putts and tell them exactly...  Where was this hotel?  Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Exactly how the putt was going to break.  Love it, man.  I knew all the yardage without trees and any of that shit.  You get to walk outside every day.  Sometimes it's a bummer, but most days it's probably great.  Well, they had people come in.  What the hell were they called?  Outings.  On Mondays.  And you had to do the outings on Mondays or you would drop in the ranks.  Caddying is all about you have to be there all the time. 
[01:04:30]  So you rise up in the ranks and then you get a lot more loops.  You know, there are jobs like that that I think are so respectable.  Right.  They're like service jobs where people really get good at them.  But we kind of ignore them in society.  Yeah, just kind of take it for granted.  Whatever game.  But you really have to pay attention.  Yeah, I was like top five.  I was always one of the first five out every day.  And other guys had to wait.  Sometimes they would wait six hours just to finally get on the course. 
[01:05:00]  Just to get one little walkthrough.  But these outings on Mondays, you had to do them.  And it was like a garbage company would come in for the day, take over the course.  And instead of a four, four and a half hour round, these rounds would take like eight hours.  It was...  A Long Island garbage cart company would come in.  It was brutal.  Must have been an interesting conversation out on the course.  I have no idea anymore.  Give me my nine iron or I'm going to shoot you in the face.  Exactly.  Pat, I'll tell you, you know, I don't know what they're doing nowadays.  But there was a lot of mafia guys when I was caddying there. 
[01:05:30]  And they couldn't have treated us nicer.  They always probably treated you great, huh?  They were way cooler than, you know, the legit guys.  Right.  Those were the assholes.  That's exactly right.  Because they probably, they expected, they probably came up having the dough.  Right.  And you were just...  If you worked hard for those guys, they always overpaid.  Yeah.  Crazy, crazy overpaid.  I'm sure most of you guys didn't start out with anything.  No, no.  You know what I mean?  And that's why you end up there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'm willing to do some shit that nobody else wants to do. 
[01:06:00]  Right, right.  Get my hands dirty.  Every once in a while, you would caddy for some of these guys.  And they would have guests right from Italy that did not speak English.  And in your head, you'd be like, why are they on Long Island?  See, like, that's so such American history that you get to live through.  Yeah.  I don't know if your kids are ever going to care, but you have that story to tell them.  Yeah, I think that's a cool thing.  And some of these guys would have... 
[01:06:30]  Their faces would be broken.  I mean, like, stereotypical.  I saw it all.  But the guys from Italy that didn't speak English, they were beyond nice, too.  But I always wondered, why are they here?  Frankie, Five Angels' brother.  Right.  From God's father.  He's got the dumb hat on.  Michael Corleone!  And then every once in a while, you would get a huge celebrity that would walk the course,  and that would be exciting.  Teli Sabalas.  Hey, Teli Sabalas!  Joe Namath one day, where, like, all the ladies followed him around the entire time. 
[01:07:00]  And a lot of the New York Islanders, because they're all from the area.  Was Joe drinking?  I don't remember anymore.  Then there would be other guys.  I hope so.  Usually hammered.  There would be other...  Oh, Whitey Ford.  Some of the old baseball guys would play over there.  So...  Damn!  I loved it.  I absolutely loved Caddy.  You'd get up before the sun, get to the course, smell the fucking grass, and have a cup of  coffee and a buttered roll, and next thing you know, they call you and you're out.  You're out.  Sounds like Caddyshack. 
[01:07:30]  With the birds.  It was just like that.  With a sprinkler going on.  I love that sound to this day.  Of course.  They nailed that movie.  Yeah, they did.  They nailed it.  That's the sound you heard every morning.  There was something so peaceful about that.  I don't know.  You're not being first out, man.  First out rules.  That's the way you want to do it.  Right.  When I play golf, I try to be first out.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll call and be like, if I can't be first out, I ain't coming in.  That's tough.  Well, you're a celebrity.  They're going to take care of you.  You just want to not wait. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Because if you think about the life you live now, as opposed to when you were 20, when  it was like, who gives a shit about five hours?  I'm going to sleep or do this.  That's now a percentage of your life that you can measure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's like, that's like half my life.  I don't know what I got left.  Right.  But five hours on a golf course sounds like I'm never going to golf again.  Three hours on the golf course sounds like I can do this again tomorrow. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  I could do that.  A friend of mine thinks like the perfect amount of golf is 12 holes.  That's about right.  Wow.  That's about right.  Yeah.  Because right at 12, you're like, oh, man, this is bullshit.  We got these guys.  Right.  You know.  By 15, you're done.  Going into the back nine, you're like, all right, let me see if I can, you know, keep  this going or beat my front nine score.  And then like, yeah.  Three or four in.  You're like, three in when you didn't.  Fuck it.  You're like, I'm good.  Fuck, I'm good.  Yeah.  Right.  We worked for the golf pro, too. 
[01:09:00]  You know, so we did some extra work for him as well.  And one of the perks was on weekends when everyone was off the course and we were done  with our job, we could play the course for free.  Yeah.  So we had those little carry bags.  Did you get good at it?  I got really, my brother was really good.  I was in the 80s, low 80s when I was really playing a lot.  Wow.  So I never pro-cated, to be honest with you.  But we would take like four or five clubs, you know, just the necessities.  And then we would play 18 holes in probably two hours, maybe less. 
[01:09:30]  You must have been hitting every shot where we needed to be.  Hit and run.  But I mean, we were young.  Those were the days you could run all day and you didn't even feel it.  Oh, you're hitting and running.  You got a boner the whole time.  Just because you can.  We would run around that course because the sun would be going down because we wouldn't  be able to get out there until, I don't know, six, seven o'clock at night probably.  In the summer, though, you know, the sun's out until almost nine.  Seriously, though, did you have a boner the whole time? 
[01:10:00]  The whole time.  I had boners while I was caddying for old ladies.  Because it was the time.  I mean, I started when I was 12.  I'm trying to remember exactly.  I think I was about just turning 13 when I started caddying.  And you know, that time as a boy, those boners would pop off.  It had nothing to do with anything going on around you.  It was so embarrassing.  It really had a mind of its own, isn't it?  Would you have to just hold a club in front of you?  I would just, you know, point it up and tie it down.  You just tie it down a little bit. 
[01:10:30]  What did you do before music?  I was a house painter.  House painter, okay.  Yeah, you ended up getting pretty good at it.  So I started my own company.  Really?  Wow.  Because there was no way I was going to make it in music the way things were going.  Yeah.  I think all that was in the San Francisco area.  So I used to, like, climb up on scaffolding and paint painted ladies.  And it was scary and fun. 
[01:11:00]  Damn.  Yeah.  It's inside, outside.  So that's not what I would want to do again.  Inside jobs are nothing.  Yeah.  It's painting the outside of a house that's a bummer.  It seems to me.  Like, having to burn paint off of a house and shit like that.  And setting up scaffolding in San Francisco has got to be a bitch.  We never did that.  That was a company that would do that.  How the fuck do you level it?  It's all, like, connected to the building by, like, twisty ties from garbage bags and shit.  Maybe a little stronger than that.  Maybe a little.  I don't know.  I hope so.  Wow.  Really.  I painted one summer in Geneseo. 
[01:11:30]  I stayed up there one summer.  I went to college up there.  I was, it was, it's a miserable job.  Yeah.  And scraping off the old paint, it would bring you to tears.  These houses up there were really old, so I don't know.  Yeah.  It was, I don't know how many layers of paint it was.  Lots.  And they wanted it scraped off before we could paint, and then I'm getting yelled at by my  boss, because I'm not doing it fast enough.  My fucking boss.  And he knew, he knew this was an impossible job.  Yeah.  Because this, the paint was so thick on this house.  I worked for a guy named Gary Magali, and he came to me once and he said, I was born to 
[01:12:00]  paint.  Don't fuck this up.  That's a great line.  You know what I'm saying, man?  Wow.  That guy's awesome.  That's a great line.  You've got to really love painting to think that you were born to do that.  I never understood that.  And he was, too, man.  He was good.  Yeah.  He was the best.  I worked for several guys, but nobody was as good as that guy.  I almost had a nervous breakdown painting, what is it, Lattice, is it called? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Lattice?  Criss-crossy stuff.  Yeah, the criss-crossy stuff.  Yeah, I call it criss-crossy stuff.  That almost brought, that almost really brought me to tears.  There's no way to paint that properly, because it starts dripping, and you've got to,  even that out, and you've got to get...  Oh, right, because you're almost wiping the brush off on the edges of the woods, so it's  just not running.  I don't know how...  Are there jobs that I can imagine are worse, like being a mover?  Yeah, yeah.  That'd be a bummer, man.  But everyone's had to do it in their life, you know? 
[01:13:00]  Move.  Move their own shit.  Right.  I had to move my guitar player the first day I met him.  What?  Wow.  Because he was moving from L.A. to San Francisco, and his back went out.  All right.  So they were like, hey, this is Jimmy, and I was like, hey, man, he's like, maybe you  help me move this shit up in my...  Fuck you.  Nope.  That was a really funny start, but we've been good buddies ever since.  Wow, man.  Never liked that shit.  I got one question about the painting. 
[01:13:30]  So have you run into anyone since being famous that you painted their house?  Yeah, there's one guy that's a drummer, and he asks occasionally if he can sit in and stuff.  But we're just not able to do that.  Yeah, hey, I got a band, thanks.  I had this one kid in my neighborhood.  And his mom was like, you know, you should go over and see his studio and stuff.  So he did.  And then he came over, and he's like, sweet, man, thanks for letting me come in. 
[01:14:00]  If you ever want to jam, let me know.  Was he serious?  Because that's kind of funny.  Oh, he was real serious, man.  Because he was like, yeah, okay, probably call you on Tuesday when my mom leaves so we can jam at her house.  I don't know what to do with that.  It was cute.  Too funny.  There are people that love their job, even if most people think it would suck.  I worked with people in air conditioning that just loved getting up in the morning and going in and doing that job. 
[01:14:30]  And I would just sit there thinking of anything I could do that wasn't this.  What else could I do besides suicide?  Yeah, yes, yes.  Besides suicide, what can I do?  That's like the least bit, like a little bit creative or fun or something.  How did you get into this?  Something.  I mean, that's a big step away from...  I know, right?  It was a magical melange of news events and timing.  We have been doing this radio show for 20 years because O.J. killed two people. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  Really?  That's a fact.  O.J. Simpson.  Because that's what made me aware of Anthony.  Anthony had a band at the time, and I was on the radio doing song parodies about the case.  And his band sent in a song that was so much better than anyone else's that sent stuff in.  And then he came in to perform it.  And that's all I was thinking at the time.  Like, oh, wow.  Well, you know, I played their song a lot, and people were like, oh, that's really good.  Do you remember the parody, both again? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  It was actually Gunna Electric Shock O.J., and it was to Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.  It just seemed to work.  And then we, you know, after the song, we started talking a little bit on the air, and there  was some kind of chemistry there, and I just started inviting Anne in.  And then 20 years later, still doing this fucking thing.  Wow, that's cool.  What was your show called before it was on the day?  Oh, The Nighttime Attitude, Pat.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  I had The Nighttime Attitude.  I was doing a night. 
[01:16:00]  He goes, yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Eating some danger dogs.  That's right.  That's great.  But isn't that weird, though?  I mean, O.J. literally had to kill two people for us to meet.  I know, yeah.  Well, that's really sweet of him.  At this show.  Who knows?  I mean, how does that shit work?  Would we have met anyway?  You know, that's the...  Because you were in the area, and maybe there would have been something else that...  The big question.  Who knows?  Well, maybe you would have keyed in on our Long Island Lolita song. 
[01:16:30]  Right, right, exactly.  Our Amy Fisher tune.  Right.  Everybody's got an Amy Fisher song.  Oh, yeah.  Well, back in the day.  It was, um...  Yeah, yeah.  Was she the one who snipped the...  She shot the Mary Jo.  Mary Jo, yeah, yeah.  Right.  But a Fuco.  The other one was...  Who's the girl that snipped the dong on your head?  Oh, that was Bobbitt.  Bobbitt.  John Wayne Bobbitt.  John Wayne Bobbitt.  What was her name, though?  Porno, like, five years after.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Lorena Bobbitt.  Lorena Bobbitt, that's right.  There was so many odd stories back then from Long Island.  It's a really...  You got a dark spot that you can't get any light to that.  And drove away with it and threw it out the window.  And they found it.  How they found it?  Can you imagine your dick is somewhere else and they actually say, good news, we found  it?  We found your dick.  Oh, yeah, my, yeah, my, yeah.  Can you imagine?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you're the guy that lost the dick, right?  Yeah.  We found a dick. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  I mean, it might not even be a dick.  Don't get excited.  I mean, we found a dick.  A dick.  Yeah.  I think we can assume it's yours at this point, but...  They attached it and it worked fine.  Yeah.  And then I think you got the surgery where you could pull a little out.  Oh, no.  You know about the surgery where you could pull a little out?  Cut the tendon.  Cut the tendon or the ligament over there and you could pull it out a little bit like a  like a cord in a vacuum cleaner.  That sounds great until you're like fucking 60, 70 years old and gravity's been tugging 
[01:18:00]  on that ligament-less dick.  Yeah, I think you need a little, a little of that inside you.  Boy, I look good.  Well, not in that way, but, right.  I mean, not that.  The other parts.  It's probably just hanging like a...  I think at that point you've got to work on your technique.  Why?  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Learn how to use what you've got instead of like...  People have lived through some terrible things in the public eye, haven't they?  And have to...  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, that's a tough thing to live through.  Had their name on it.  Yeah, that's like, you know, John Wayne Bobbitt.  You're the guy.  You're the guy that got your dick cut off.  Like, forever.  But it seems like he didn't have much going on before that.  No.  And it became his thing.  He became pretty famous because of that.  Yeah.  Right.  He really did.  He embraced it.  You had to go through that.  I don't know, man.  And I can't imagine not wanting to trade that in for keep me out of the whole thing.  Yeah.  Keep me anonymous and out of the whole thing.  Good point.  I'm good right here in this little apartment with nothing in it. 
[01:19:00]  Well, good.  If I have to trade that for losing my dick, it's no trade.  I won't do it.  Well, we've got to take a break.  That's for sure.  Yes, sir.  Are you...  What are you doing?  What are you doing now?  I'm going to go do some recording with this girl in a minute.  Nice.  Rick could.  Thanks so much for having me into your show, man.  Oh, no problem.  No, I was happy to see you in the halls the other day because you guys were always cool  to us.  Yeah, no, you guys are always cool to us.  There's not much I can do for you. 
[01:19:30]  Hell no, man.  You helping us out is way more than I can see you.  You know what you can do for us?  Come in and play again.  Yeah, that was great.  People loved that.  Yeah, when the guys are back around, for sure, I love that.  Yeah, let's set that up.  So let's promote the new single, Angel in Blue Jeans, right?  Yeah, man.  Off the Upcoming Train album, Bulletproof Picasso, which is out in September.  It's Patrick Monaghan.  We'll play the song and we'll see you soon.  Great.  Thanks again.  Poor man.  Thank you.

[01:24:00]  Complete protection.  Completely American-made.  May I have your attention, please, for a moment?  We interrupt your regularly scheduled OBF-3 best of the week  to bring you this O&A throwback.  And then this morning, I realized, listening to the news,  there's commercials all the time.  They throw them in.  Oh, really? I didn't know that.  Yeah, I know, right?  Ugh, enough.  Are you from the future?  I'm from the future.  I hate pianos.  What?  I despise the piano. 
[01:24:30]  Unless it's being used in a band-type thing or something.  But these fucking commercials where it's like,  this somber piano's playing because some guy's talking about his cancer fucking treatment or something.  I hate the piano when it's just playing alone and somber.  And cancer is rough.  You don't need to make it rougher with piano music.  Yeah, don't give me the fucking piano shit.  When it's being played in a band, an orchestra, something like that.  But I push the button so hard, I'm like, fucking hate pianos. 
[01:25:00]  See?  See, it all ties in.  The flow chart is correct.  The flow chart, the milk, peanut butter, and piano, it all ties to the same thing.  Something was there.  When you were a lad, somebody said,  now you have to put your tulips on my penis,  and your butter do it good and get the milk in your mouth.  I didn't even think of that.  You're right.  It's all word association.  So far, you don't like peanut butter, milk, and the piano.  And the piano, solo piano.  Solo piano.  Yeah, I love piano.  And non-whites.  Yeah, well, does that really have to be written? 
[01:25:30]  You want to hear some piano?  Chocula.  Oh, I'm going to hear some piano.  And I realize this.  This piano clip online has 7 million views.  Let me tell you something.  Yes.  I realize this today, but I've noticed for years I get, like, physically, like, my shoulders go up.  And I have to, I can't hit the state, see?  Because this is always accompanied with,  the cancer centers of New Jersey want you to know that if you're suffering from melanoma, 
[01:26:00]  it's always some, little, yeah,  little Veronica was living her normal life as a child when they found a tumor on her neck.  I hate pianos.  This is nice.  No, it's not.  It's depressing.  This is fucking depressing music.  Are you sad?  Why are you yelling?  No, it's, I, it's Monday.  I want to sleep.  How come you don't like being sad? 
[01:26:30]  No, this is sad music.  If I go to hell, I'm going to go play in the piano.  Remember, uh, Great Falls of Fire?  This, listen to this.  It's nice and relaxing.  No, it's depressing.  This makes me want to get jerked off.  My dick gets hard when I hear this music.  Look at, look at the, look at the ray, uh, light coming through the trees there.  If it's Jerry Lee Lewis's piano, that's fine.  Where he's fucking playing it like a maniac.  But, but this shit.  Who played him? 
[01:27:00]  Was that Randy Quaid?  I was feeling pretty good for the la la la.  That's what he used piano?  It almost sounds like.  I was feeling pretty good.  Good.  Good.  No, this is depressing dribble shit.  I hate this.  You don't like, uh, slowing it down ever, do you?  No, I do.  I do.  Believe me.  You do.  But not in this way.  Piano.  Why don't you pick up your tootally do?  Stop it.  You like this.  I'm not even going to tootally do to this.  Why?  I refuse to tootally do to this. 
[01:27:30]  This just bothers you?  It bothers me.  Does the other thing get sad with this piano music?  You don't like going to that sad place, do you?  No, it's not even that.  It's not sad.  It's not like a tear-inducing.  It's this depressing, like, who would want to listen to this?  This is inspirational.  No, it's not.  It's just, it's, you know, almost 8 billion views.  Who's watching that?  I want to push my ass up in the air.  Like, those hands will drop the back of my thighs. 
[01:28:00]  And hopefully you get the knuckle into the asshole.  This is massage music, folks.  I hate this.  All right.  Get it.  If there were even maybe vocals to it, or a little drum track, or just something.  Vocals ruin this type of music.  No, it does something.  It's just the single clinkety-clinkety keys.  I hate them. 
[01:28:30]  You sound like little tears.  I hate this.  All right.  You all right?  14,000 likes and 270 dislikes.  That's all from the same person who has said.  Yeah.  What are some of the comments?  Give me one of the comments.  See?  All right.  Thank you.  What?  What?  Suddenly, I feel like crying.  Life is so beautiful.  See?  To everyone who watched this video, enjoy life. 
[01:29:00]  Life is one thing.  You live at once.  So cheer up, everyone.  Cheer up.  Then go listen to this.  So cheer up, everyone.  And be happy.  Don't worry about anything.  Don't worry about anything.  Because a bright future awaits everyone.  Not everyone.  The best thing you can do is not worry about anything.  Because at last, this is all a dream.  And we got to also dream big.  See?  Made me feel like crying. 
[01:29:30]  Then what's to do that?  Ah, this song is beautiful.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Makes me feel calm and relaxed.  Gives me a big smile.  Oh, really?  Well, today, I was mad at my dad.  But now I just want to hug him.  This life is so full of joy.  Fuck you and your joyful life.  Fuck you and your joyful life.  You didn't finish it.  This life is full of joy and happiness. 
[01:30:00]  Do not let no one change life.  That's a jerk.  Be happy.  Give everything you have in this life.  And never stop smiling.  It's because it's all fucking...  It's a facade.  It's all bullshit.  These people writing this crap.  The same people that would smack their kids around.  Life is beautiful.  And then the second the piano music stops, he's belting his wife in the mouth.  What about this one?  Yeah, I'm so pumped for peace and tranquility.  Yeah.  How are you pumped for peace and tranquility? 
[01:30:30]  Good.  Oh, bravo.  Bravo.  Look, I got a Pez dispenser on my lap and I'm making it clap with my two fingers.  Oh.  That's sinful.  Wait, let's go for the next suggested video.  This one's called the most relaxing music imaginable.  Okay, so this is different.  Holy shit, almost 13 million views.  This is a little different.  You like this?  It's more new agey.  I never thought of going on YouTube and relaxing.  See, this is...  I like some of this.  See?  This I don't mind. 
[01:31:00]  This kind of up.  You can shut your eyes and relax to this and make believe you're in outer space.  This?  This is too high up for that.  Yeah, it's a little too high in.  It's a little too high in.  Well, maybe if you don't have headphones on.  It's just barely playing in the background.  This is like Avatar music.  Let's play some Enya.  Enya.  I don't know.  Yeah, this might be a little too much, but this has nothing to do with piano music. 
[01:31:30]  See, I don't mind.  You don't mind this one?  I wouldn't play it, but it doesn't anger me to the point where I have to turn the fucking radio off.  You know what?  When those dumb commercials come on.  I'm with you, though.  I'm not a big fan of the piano, either.  Relaxing music I like, but piano by itself...  Piano's just...  How about so much?  Hey, Lottie, Lottie!  Lottie, Lottie!  You hate that piano, too?  Hey, Lottie!  No, that's great shit.  That's upbeat.  I like, like, you know, fucking ragtime piano.  Like, ragtime. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  But, right.  Get us some ragtime piano by John Valby going into break.  We'll show you what the piano's supposed to do.  Yes.  Do you know what I can't find by Valby?  He did a solo called Flying.  His old...  When I was a kid...  Oh, he played it for us.  But I don't know where to find that anymore.  It's his legit music?  It's his stuff that he would do on his dirty CDs.  He would do this...  Or his dirty tapes.  He would do these, like, legit piano solos.  And was it either after Dirt or Give Me Dirt or Give Me Death, which were the name of these cassette tapes. 
[01:32:30]  It was on one of them.  And it's not on the...  He doesn't put it on the CDs for some reason.  Yeah, I don't know.  I haven't heard that in years.  But it's no lyrics.  It's just him showing what he could really...  It's really good, too, man.  If anybody has it and could email it to therealjimnorton at gmail, flying by John Valby off Give Me Dirt or Give Me Death.  And Big Beto from Texas, I want to acknowledge that I know what Hearts of Space is all about.  You ever listen to Hearts of Space?  That radio show?  Hearts of Space?  An hour of this type of music.  Is it on this ridiculous platform? 
[01:33:00]  Sometimes you would travel to the clouds.  Yeah?  Yes.  You would have a music journey to the clouds.  Oh.  You want to do a little Hearts of Space?  A little, um...  You got any of the, uh...  What are you doing?  Like astral projection?  All sorts of shit, man.  That happens?  Do you leave your body and cruise through the cosmos?  Sometimes you would climb the Himalayas for an hour.  For an hour.  For an hour?  Yeah.  Or walk through the jungle.  A rainforest.  As you just kind of lay there with your eyes shut.  Listening to certain music and it conjures up images. 
[01:33:30]  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I liked it back in the day, back in the day.  That could work.  Shit like that.  Sunday nights.  After a long weekend of partying, you just chill out.  I'll have to hear this.  And you walk through the rainforest.  I'll have to hear this.  What is this one called?  An Audio Introduction to Hearts of Space.  No, no.  Fuck that.  Give me the intro.  Give me some of the names.  I'm telling you.  They come up with names.  Give me right into it.  Slow music for fast times.  You like that?  What is that about?  I want to read a few of these.  Guitar Space. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, Guitar Space.  World Space.  Celtic Space.  Electronic Space.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, how about World Space?  World Space.  I want to feel that.  You're not going to like World Space.  Why?  Too much black shit.  What?  Just a minute.  All right.  Oh, man.  It's like a call to prayer.  This is good.  Clits should shrivel when they hear this.  Fuck, they pull the hood over their heads. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, this is beheading music.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  I actually like some of that hardcore fucking Muslim Arab music.  I like that in cabs.  Sometimes you'll hear one and you're like, fuck.  I do understand how this would inspire you to attack a contractor.  Just kill.  I'm Stephen Hill.  Oh, that was a Hearts of Space minute with a Turkish.  A Balkan drum.  No, no, Stephen.  It was 36 seconds.  Yeah.  58 more.  Stop talking, Stephen. 
[01:35:00]  Can you give us a minute?  A template of music from around the world and across the century.  Why are you whispering, Stephen?  Try Celtic Space.  On here, Celtic Space.  Yeah, I want...  Or Celtic.  I'm sure it's Celtic.  Well, I'll go with Celtic.  Here's a Hearts of Space minute.  I love you.  I want to marry you.  You can do that with every single one of these. 
[01:35:30]  I go to another one.  I could totally do this if I knew it.  Go to Piano Space.  Let's see if this piano is a little better for Ant.  Oh, Christ.  Here's a Hearts of Space minute.  Yay.  Ugh.  No.  This is just depressing, creepy piano music.  Turkish music was good.  Fuck this shit.  Think, uh...  Think the old detective movies.  Oh, what?  Sure.  Yeah.  I knew she'd come in eventually.  Paris stems on her. 
[01:36:00]  I drank a shot of whiskey when I saw a silhouette in my doorway.  Then we fucked over my desk.  I had cigarette breath and plaque on my teeth.  In the 50s.  And it was perfectly normal to drink a coffee and smoke a cigarette.  And you couldn't see her retching off camera.  My awful ciggy breath.  Ciggy breath?  You think everyone just had really bad breath?  Terrible breath.  Terrible.  I put my cigarette out on that little dimple over her back. 
[01:36:30]  My breath smelled like rotted tooth and ciggies and coffee.  You know they didn't invent tongue scrapers.  So there was no scraping of the tongue.  Sam Spade saying that.  So I used my tongue scrapers to not offend the woman.  I kept all the gunk under my desk so I could enjoy and sniff it later.  After the dame left.  Sometimes I would rub it all over my genitals.  Why do I have to pee there?  Why does it go there?  Flow chart.  Flow chart.  43 tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow. 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to get pictures, lady.  Tim, you're older than me now.  That's so weird.  How did that happen?  How did that happen?  What year did we fucking cross?  I think 39.  39?  Yeah, that's about right.  It's depressing.  This one sucks.  I'm in your 40s.  It was a hot day.  The kind of day that makes the ball bag stick to your thigh.  He always describes that.  I like the weather.  My ankle was swollen.  If you don't have orthotics, it's 1951.  So I have fat, swollen ankles all the time.  And dumpster breath. 
[01:37:30]  So I kiss that dame.  I don't shave my pubes either.  My ass crack is smelly.  But you know, she was on Kemp too.  They weren't shaving down there.  Her big bush.  Her vagina smelled like a garbage bag robbing a bank.  This is what?  Open Anthony's best of the week.  Yep.  Thank you.  Oh, we might have something?  Yeah, case closed.  What do you mean case closed?  Case closed.  The EROC mystery might be done because we decided to... 
[01:38:00]  It's not might be.  Oh, wow.  This is solved.  Travis is sitting in a seat that EROC also sits in.  Yes, which is one happier seat today.  And there's a computer there and, you know...  Going through the browsing history.  Okay.  Browsing history of EROC's computer.  Now, I know what I search for.  Okay.  I search...  Gay porn.  Yes, exactly.  And stars, of course.  And I certainly did not search for...  Italian bikini pics?  A hotel in Rome. 
[01:38:30]  And a hotel in Florence.  Case closed.  What time is it in Italy right now?  Three o'clock.  In the afternoon, huh?  Yes.  Well, I would say that those phone numbers could probably be gotten from the website.  Oh, boy.  You know what, Jim?  You're probably right.  Oh, boy.  And I think a well-wish a vacation.  I think we should call and wish him well. 
[01:39:00]  I think that's 100% accurate.  You think that's a good idea?  I think it's a terrific idea.  Just to let him know his friends are thinking about him.  A buongiorno.  A buongiorno.  Hey, Rocco.  What day is he going to be there?  Son, they win.  They turn.  They run.  Yeah, I hope Michael Corleone's fucking wife is giving him a ride.  Now, how does the staff feel about him just blatantly lying to you guys who have never  really done him, well, you haven't done him as much harm as us?  Italy.  We weren't told he was going on vacation. 
[01:39:30]  You guys were told Florida.  That's got to hurt a little more.  Yeah.  Of course, because it's a blatant lie.  It's not like he just didn't say it.  He lied to everybody's face.  And even if he said, well, I did go to Florida, but then I went to Italy from Florida.  That's not the same thing.  He lied to everybody.  Wow, he did.  So he's going to be in Rome and Florence.  It's just bad for team.  You know what I mean?  For team spirit.  Why did he feel compelled to not tell anybody?  Do you see what's going on?  We would have talked about this. 
[01:40:00]  He's a lunatic.  So, Iraq, where are you going on vacation?  Oh, yeah, I'm going to Rome and Florence.  Oh, that's cool.  You got the names of those hotels, Travis?  Yeah, I got the phone numbers.  I was just making sure I knew how to dial internationally.  Oh, wow.  Give me that.  I have nothing.  I'm going on record.  I have nothing to do with this.  We wouldn't be calling him if he hadn't decided that, oh, I have to be slick again.  Exactly.  I have absolutely nothing to do with this.  Slicky Iraq. 
[01:40:30]  We've got to call.  It is the front desk.  You left a Simpsons figure.  Please make sure the hotel name's not on our fucking show.  Oh, boy.  I'm not sure if the dump button still works here, does it?  Let's hope so.  Well, my on-off doesn't.  My cough doesn't.  Let's ask Mars.  Mars.  Come and look at it the way I do.  When's everything going to get fixed?  I need my buttons.  I don't know. 
[01:41:00]  That's a good question.  Italy.  God damn.  That's a pretty righteous trip.  Sounds cool as hell, right?  Fuck.  Man.  Him and the wife.  Let me tell you.  This is a beautiful hotel.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  What are we doing?  We're calling right now.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  I had to turn the mic off because Sam was reading the numbers out loud.  Yes, and then they'll probably answer by saying the name of the hotel.  It's a nice hotel.  Let's say, is Mr. 
[01:41:30]  I mean, it looks like a nice hotel.  Is Mr. Nagel there?  Yes.  Could you, the Nagel room, please?  Please hold.  Brr, brr, brr.  If the answer is, we just got to go, how's Florida?  Yeah.  Florida.  Huh?  Oh, oh, what?  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  Travis is like, ah.  Ah.  What's, what's?  Nothing.  Just five people trying to figure out how to dial Italy.  Oh, yeah.  Dial international. 
[01:42:00]  The international language.  You know.  Love.  Looking up hotels.  How far are Florence and Rome apart?  Does anybody know?  Oh, God.  I have no idea.  On map.  How far is Sal?  Pretty far, huh?  Sal opened his arms wide.  Yeah.  It's about a foot apart.  According to Sal.  Very far.  See, it's a flight.  I would assume so, yeah.  Don't people take the train from, like, Italy to Rome and stuff?  Oh, I don't know.  Well, Italy is, Rome isn't.  Is it?  Rome is in Italy.  I go to Disney World.  I don't know.  Is this Rome its own country? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, that's the Vatican.  Yeah.  Rome is in Italy, as is Florence.  Is he going to the Fat again?  Did you?  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know.  Look at that.  What's going on?  There's turmoil going on in that room.  I don't know.  That room, it's ringing.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's keep the mic off.  Why are we excited?  We're excited that we're dialing a fucking fat kid in Italy.  A fat kid in Italy.  Sam is speaking to someone right now. 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  Sam is speaking to somebody at the hotel, asking for the young Nagel couple.  Yes.  Amore.  Why did we bother doing this for Iraq? 
[01:43:30]  I don't know.  We just want to see how he's doing.  It's the afternoon.  He's probably not in there.  He's probably seeing the sights.  Yep.  Right?  Yeah.  Taking a little tour.  A little excursion.  Okay.  Apparently, he's not in that hotel.  Uh-huh.  Or he's using an assumed name.  Well, yeah.  What could it be?  Yeah.  Eric Snowden.  Well, what if he...  We don't know if he went to Rome or Florence first. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  That's true.  So, he might be at the other hotel.  Yeah.  Which point?  Let me check the other hotel.  Yeah.  Check that one out.  We've got to locate the Nagel.  Whoa.  His other hotel has lots of stars.  Oh.  Oh, no.  How funny it is to hear an Italian guy repeat after you and go,  Uh-uh.  A Nagel.  Uh-uh.  A Nagel.  Yes.  We have seen him.  We thought it was a Pavarotti. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  We're going to try the other one.  We had to put in a special toilet in a room like we used to with Luciano.  He'll break a one.  Big Heine.  Big Heine.  All right.  This is a nice hotel, too.  Hotel number two.  Where does he get all his money from?  Nagel is rich. 
[01:45:00]  I don't know if it's an anniversary gift.  Is it his wife's anniversary?  No.  It's from that Daily News thing that he won.  Oh.  Is he still living off of that?  Jesus.  He's living large.  His parents might have bought them a trip to Italy.  Oh, man.  Or maybe they won it.  Well, this guy knows how far Florence and Paul in Maryland.  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah.  If you want to, Rome's about the center of the country. 
[01:45:30]  So, you know, go below Rome and you're in southern Italy.  And it's about a couple hours if you rent a car.  You don't have to fly between them.  I heard an hour and a half on the bullet train.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  You can take the train or you just rent a car.  And there's highways that connect them all.  Look, you've got a couple hours of ride.  I want to take a bullet train.  I don't know.  I mean, Italian trains.  I mean, other than that, they do have a fast one.  But the average Italian train, you would think they're roasting goats in the aisles.  It's unbelievably bad.  Smells?  Goats.  I mean, it's like a third world train.  It's ridiculous.  And nothing's on time in that country. 
[01:46:00]  Nothing.  How's the Italian food here?  Try this Simpsons theme park.  It's the best in the city.  How are we going, guys?  All right, thanks.  We're calling the other hotel, right?  How's it going?  Sam's trying to call.  Sam's.  Oh, okay.  It's a miracle he got through the first call, by the way.  Yeah.  With all of us just snickering in here.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope he's there.  Oh, the Nego room.  Yes.  Please hold. 
[01:46:30]  You think they know him?  Put you right through.  Oh, the one that's always ordering at the room service.  Right.  No?  Nothing.  We're waiting.  Hang on.  Okay.  Nothing.  We can't go fast.  It's a while to connect.  Sam's waiting for it to ring.  That stupid ring.  Yeah, well, I mean, if this doesn't work, we'll just call every hotel in Italy.  There's a stupid siren.  Oh? 
[01:47:00]  They're chatting in there.  I'm sorry, what?  Oh, I was just...  Yeah, we saw all the hand gesturing.  Yeah, a lot of gesturing going on.  What are you in Italy, too?  You're talking with your hands.  All right, wow.  I saw hands being thrown up in the air.  Sam's talking with the hotel.  Maybe he's under the name The Consumer.  Oh, I'm The Consumer?  Oh, The Consumer.  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  I follow you.  What?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Travis is laughing at me.  Travis is freaking out.  Come on, please.  All right.  Travis is...  Sam's coming in with an update.  Oh, my God.  That's true.  This is an international caper.  Yes, it is a caper.  Yes.  It's officially a caper.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Sam's still talking? 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Here comes Sam.  Sam's coming.  Here comes Sam with some information.  All right.  A little intel.  Yes.  Eric is not in Florence.  Okay.  He left yesterday.  He checked out yesterday from that hotel.  Yes.  Ah.  All right.  So he's in Rome.  He's definitely in Italy.  I like that we're so pleased with ourself that we tracked an obese man to Italy. 
[01:48:30]  We told people Florida.  I wasn't supposed to know anything.  Yeah.  We didn't even know he was on vacation.  And now we know his whereabouts.  He's in Rome.  They checked out yesterday.  He's in Rome.  So maybe he's going to Rome now.  Maybe that's why the hotel didn't know that name.  Yeah.  Cancel his reservation.  Oh.  Would that be great?  He guessed it.  You're not having the reservation.  You can't.  Get the room away. 
[01:49:00]  He was sent to a hostel.  Not what's the hostel?  A hostel.  No.  Yeah.  A hostel.  His wife has a possession stolen.  Oh, that'd be great.  Wow.  That's something.  All right.  That's good.  So he just left Florence.  The Nagel.  The Nagel.  What did she say?  Or he say?  The guy.  He was like.  The first one.  He was just looking up.  He was like.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  He left yesterday.  And then the second one said.  Oh.  They leave. 
[01:49:30]  They leave.  I was like.  Oh.  But when did they leave?  Maybe.  They check out yesterday.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  They pick up the phone.  We're making international calls.  They speak a different language when they pick up the phone.  Put it.  It's on his computer.  He was searching these hotels.  Oh, Nagel.  He left clues.  And you have to ask him.  Excuse me.  Do you speak English?  Oh, yes.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  All right.  Do you have a lazy, unshaven man?  Slovenly bumbling around your hotel.  All right.  All right.  The adventure continues.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Huh?  Don Wickland just texted me.  All right.  Uh-huh.  He said, Iraq told me before he left if I needed him to email him, don't text or call  since there is bad service in that part of Florida.  He said, in that part of Florida. 
[01:50:30]  He said it's a ton.  Why did he feel he had to lie about Italy?  Well, I mean, I understand that part of it.  Why?  The whole phone number incident from last time.  Yeah, but that has nothing to do with him saying he's going to Italy.  That has nothing to do with it.  You could just say, how about this?  Don't call me.  I'm going to Italy.  Right.  That's it.  That's it.  The negative.  Yeah.  Oh, Iraq might be on a cruise. 
[01:51:00]  He flew into Florence, went around the Mediterranean, and then end up in Rome and fly home from there.  Oh, maybe he's on a...  According to Justin in Kentucky.  Well, he was in that hotel.  Right.  So.  Yeah.  And then he'd take a few days on that.  Well, that's true.  Oh.  Go back to his computer.  See if he's...  Trust me.  I'm going back so many days.  Oh, he might be on a cruise right now?  No, I didn't.  On a cruise.  I found, like, you know, airline history and...  Well, just that he was at that website. 
[01:51:30]  At those hotels, I didn't see anything about a cruise.  How much did the airfare, did I say?  No, I can't log into his computer.  Why wouldn't he wipe his history?  I can see how much the room costs.  You can see room rates on that?  Yeah.  How much room rates?  If you're going out...  You're curious about that?  Yeah, I imagine.  Six.  How much?  Six hundred bucks a week?  A night?  A night.  Holy shit.  Whoa!  Six hundred a night for the Nagel?  Wow.  Wow.  If you're going out of your way to tell her when you're going to Florida, when you're really  going to Italy, why would you scrub your computer a little bit?  Uh-huh. 
[01:52:00]  Why would you do any of it?  None of it makes any sense.  None of it makes sense.  It just makes us want to do this.  He didn't think he'd get caught until he came.  He thought he'd come back and have a victory moment.  Right.  I was in Italy.  You know, that confident Iraq matter.  And we'd all be like, who cares?  Yeah.  But we wouldn't be doing this.  If he had said, I'm going to Italy.  Right.  And then all the evidence pointed to him being in Italy.  Right.  There'd be no reason to go through his web history.  No.  Then who cares?  And he's safe because he's in Italy.  Yeah.  He is. 
[01:52:30]  He also has a voicemail that doesn't give his phone number out.  So what could possibly happen if he just told us?  Nothing.  But he told Wicklin he went to Florida.  Right.  He didn't tell us.  And we were within one day of getting through to his hotel room.  If we had done this yesterday, they would have put me through to his hotel room.  Right.  It really is like chasing an international criminal.  Yeah.  We missed him by a day.  Yeah.  Carmen Santy blowhole.  Terrible joke.  This is taken.  This is taken. 
[01:53:00]  This is.  We're just looking for bottles with the labels ripped off so we know where he's been.  Oh, well.  That guy seemed like he remembered Eric.  He was like, oh, no.  They check out.  They leave.  Like, as I was repeating the name.  Thank God.  They check out.  They leave.  We got to restock everything.  They leave.  They leave.  They leave.  They leave.  They leave.  They leave.  They leave.  We got.  Oh, ravioli boy.  Yeah.  Everyone like him.  Ravioli.  Gotta replace the tongue.  Ravioli boy.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  You know what's up, right?  You know what's up.  You crush a ravioli and drink it like a beverage.  In a martini glass.  You think he's eating well in Italy?  Oh, God.  Oh, I bet he's stuffing himself.  Do you think there are any carbohydrates to be had?  Oh, my God.  Every meal his wife is probably looking at him, plotting to have him killed.  He's going to visit the Vatican.  No, I said that before.  Oh, you did?  I said this. 
[01:54:00]  Sorry.  I thought you just said Vatican.  Why would I say it like that?  I know.  His wife also knows that if she did anything to him, nobody would be looking for evidence  in Italy.  They would all be looking for him in Florida.  Yeah.  Nobody knows he's there.  Right.  So bad.  I don't know.  But wives were told.  Of course, wives are going to pass that info.  She was probably excited, though.  She's going on a trip.  Right.  Maybe Iraq didn't let his wife know that there was a secret plan that was happening.  Yeah.  That he was telling everyone else Florida. 
[01:54:30]  Just for kicks.  Right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Missed him by one day.  We could probably get him tomorrow at the other place.  Oh, yeah.  Give him a try tomorrow.  A cruise thing, maybe.  I don't know.  He wouldn't have been at a hotel for that long.  A couple days.  Who knows how long he was there.  And who knows how that cruise is.  Maybe it's a quick...  He might have just been there for a...  But he might have just checked in the day before.  Well, then where was he since Thursday?  On a boat.  No, I think you're flying to Florence to get on ships. 
[01:55:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  Right.  So maybe he hangs out in Florence a little bit, because there's enough to see.  Now he's on a ship.  Because, all right, tomorrow...  I mean, yesterday was Sunday.  He gets on the ship Sunday.  He does about two days.  And now he's in Rome for two days and flies back.  That's not bad.  If there's no cruise information on that web history.  The browsing history goes airline, Florence Hotel, then Rome Hotel.  He's probably checking...  Right, right.  All right.  So he hasn't checked into the Rome Hotel yet. 
[01:55:30]  I bet he's checking in either today.  But where was he last night?  We should leave a message form at the front desk.  He checked out yesterday.  Could we leave a message form at the front desk?  Oh, my God.  I don't see why not.  Mr. Nagel, you have the message.  Yeah, we should leave a...  Oh, just make-believe.  Yes.  Yeah, we were told to...  Just like a little message that says,  we know, Greg Anton.  Says, you are the lying, a piece of a shit.  Yes.  Call...  A message for the piggy boy? 
[01:56:00]  Piggy boy.  No more ravioli.  Yes, no more ravioli, a piggy boy.  Let's call him up.  Let's call him up and say,  hey, you know, is Eric Nagel there?  They say no.  Like, well, he told us to call here  if we had any issues at work.  Is he checking in today, then?  Because I thought he was already there.  When is Eric Nagel checking in?  Right.  And say, piggy boy.  P-E-E-G-Y.  Yes.  So this way they'll write it out like that,  but it sounds Italian?  Yes. 
[01:56:30]  They won't know.  I still like your idea of canceling his reservation.  I like that more than I like breathing.  Roland?  A slob-o!  A slob-o!  Yes, yes.  Yes, no more ravioli, he's a piggy boy.  Let's check it out.  I call the hotel during the break and let's see.  Trick him into telling us that when he's checking in.  Okay.  I say, oh, it's work.  He said he was going to be at this hotel.  Yeah, he's supposed to be on trial for child pornography 
[01:57:00]  back here in the States.  Oh, there's the baby toucher.  Don't go anywhere.  We'll be right back with more Best of the Week  from the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Good morning.

[01:57:30]  Good socks.  Socks that stay on.  How about underwear?  Hear the Today Show while you drive.  The fun continues out on the closet.  Today Show Radio.  Sirius XM.  Channel 108.  Starts Wednesday with a special performance by Maroon 5.  Yeah, this is Jim Norton.  Oh, fuck you.  Most of the time, he doesn't give a shit about you and your stupid problems.  Puts the shotgun with the lips on.  Most of the time.  But for one hour every week, Jim Norton cares.  If I don't know how to tell her, I'm really not going to suck some other dude's dick. 
[01:58:00]  Well, don't do it if you don't want to.  He can't take it back.  And cares deeply.  Just go out and cheat on her and then make her smell your dick and say,  Look what you made me do.  If you have problems in a phone, listen to The Jim Norton Show.  Wednesday at 3 p.m. on the East, noon on the West.  On your internet.  Can you keep a secret?  Because I've got a really awesome one for you.  I'm not really supposed to tell you, but I'm going to anyway,  because you seem like the type of person who makes the most of awesome opportunities.  Here it is.  The time is now for you to invest in your own Crunch gym.  Why? 
[01:58:30]  Because Crunch's competitive and progressive business model has turned them into an entrepreneur 500 franchise,  as well as the fastest growing full-size franchise in the $26 billion fitness industry.  Oh, you knew that already?  So I guess it isn't much of a secret then,  except for the fact that Crunch also has the highest owner satisfaction in the fitness industry.  Oh, you knew that too?  Well, obviously you don't know that much because you haven't invested in a Crunch gym yet.  Once the secret gets out, everyone will want their own awesome gym,  filled with awesome equipment, classes, and trainers. 
[01:59:00]  And then everything you know will have gotten you nowhere close to owning a Crunch gym.  And that's not awesome.  But it will be awesome for all the people I just told over the radio.

This is Opie's Best of the Week.  Opie's Best of the Week.  Opie, it is.  What?  Oh.  Hey, I'm right here.  Oh, sorry.  Why do you have an angry look on your face, Bubba Ray?  What's up, man?  Who's angry?  You're out there, like, pacing and stuff.  This is my happy face. 
[02:02:00]  This is your happy face.  Dude, you got fucking big.  You fucking look great.  Jesus Christ.  Look at you.  Come shake your hands.  Shake everybody's hands.  Say hello.  What's up, brother?  Wow.  That's a man's handshake right there.  Dude, you're fucking huge.  I'm huge.  Huge in a good way, I hope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're in good shape.  Yeah.  My arm is bigger than your body.  Yeah, you really are a large man.  Holy fuck.  Ha ha.  How are you guys doing?  Thanks for having me on.  Appreciate it.  Long time no say.  It has been a while, huh?  The mic sucks.  Yeah.  Does it?  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Well, that's, you know.  Well, hold on.  Let me turn yours off.  Try it again.  There you go.  How's that?  Better?  No.  We're having horrible mic problems today.  Oh.  Best radio show in the world, and my mic sucks.  That's always the fucking case with this.  Our equipment stinks on ice.  Try it again.  You can move over there.  All right.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  Are you guys ribbing me?  You just want to see me bounce around from chair to chair?  That's the mic that was Anthony's.  That's...  We would be guilty of doing that, though.  You're right.  Right.  But not this time.  And my headphones don't work either. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, shit.  Maybe the volume just isn't up.  God damn.  We would do something like this, though.  There you go.  But no, we have a really shitty studio, and for some reason they don't care.  So, whatever.  It's all good.  Yeah.  You know Sammy Roberts, right?  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Sounds like the fucking pride of WWE now.  He's like their little mascot.  Everyone knows him.  I hate that he's like all of his childhood heroes now know his name.  Yeah.  The only one that doesn't care about him is Vince, who could hire him.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[02:03:30]  Sam, go get me a coffee.  Come on, boy.  And you want to be called Bubba Ray Dudley, obviously.  I'm going to Bubba Ray, Bully Ray.  I mean, I'm Bully Ray now in TNA, but that's cool.  Whatever you guys want.  But you'll always be Bubba Ray.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  At least we got that out.  When people come up to you on the street, what do they call you?  No, I'm getting bullied now, because I've been bullied for three years, and it's the persona  that I've adopted since I became a singles wrestler.  So, you know, it's going really well, and people dig the bully name. 
[02:04:00]  But if Vince calls and says, Bubba, we need you back, that Bully Ray goes out the fucking  window.  Out the window.  Quickly.  That's hilarious.  That's why we like you.  You're honest.  Bubba, this is Vince.  Well, Vince, they call me Bully now.  The hell they do.  I need you at the garden.  Exactly.  I think, and you don't have to comment about this, obviously, but I think it's such bullshit  that Vince takes your names after everything you did for his organization. 
[02:04:30]  Well...  And it's happened to a lot of you guys.  It just doesn't seem fair.  Here is the deal.  Like, when we left there in 2005, he had bought ECW at a bankruptcy court, and since the Dudley  name was an original intellectual property of ECW, he was claiming ownership to the name.  Right.  But we had used it for years before we got to WWE, and Vince hired the Dudley boys.  Right.  So it's one of those things that we could have dragged it through court.  It would have cost about $100,000.  And in the end, I'm glad they kept the name, because we still make a really great living 
[02:05:00]  on our residuals.  Right.  And, you know, we just reinvented ourselves as a team with TNA, and, you know...  Right.  Everyone knows it's you.  I mean, it's...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So you guys do make money off your old name.  Oh, absolutely.  Four times a year, a very nice check comes in the mail, courtesy of Vince McMahon.  I think this is the first we're hearing of that.  All right, so that's not as bad, then.  Could you have bought the intellectual property rights for your name had you known this was  going to come, or was that not available?  No.  Once you go there, you sign everything over.  You basically give them everything.  Your blood.  Your firstborn.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  You know.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't like that, when your boss is a billionaire.  It seems a little...  Listen, I really don't have a...  A bit greedy.  No, I know you have nothing bad to say.  But I really don't.  But from an outsider's point, it seems like not fair at times.  Well, you've got to also look at what they're giving you, you know, giving you the stage,  you know, to make something of yourself, make a star, a big superstar.  It was an awesome time there.  Awesome time.  Yep.  Why did you leave, or what happened?  There was just nothing left to do there.  You know, tag team wrestling, we were there for the heyday of tag team wrestling. 
[02:06:00]  Hell yeah, you were.  And, you know, there was just no more teams to wrestle, nothing left to do, and Vince  just said, you know, when the time is right, we'll have you back.  Wow.  And, you know, the time hasn't been right yet.  You know, tag team wrestling was kind of stale in WWE, and they're trying to breathe life  back into it, and, you know, maybe one day, you never say never, but...  What happened to tag team wrestling, though?  Well, why wasn't it as good anymore?  But you just didn't have the quality of the teams of, like, the Dudleys and the Hardys 
[02:06:30]  and Edge and Christian and things like that.  Right.  How you doing?  I'd like to play Connected Dots.  So, um...  She sweats a lot.  Yeah.  Are you sweating?  She's got a little sundress on.  She's the one that was sweating a lot.  She does construction on her.  She's very adorable, though.  You're adorable.  You're cute.  Oh, dare I say hot.  Whoa.  Lovely girl.  But sweats a lot.  Anyway.  You're so fine.  Break it up.  How many years ago was that that you left? 
[02:07:00]  That was 2005.  It's already been nine years.  Yeah.  Yeah, 2005.  Yep.  Yeah.  Maybe 2006.  I don't know.  Huh.  Okay.  But things have been great since then.  I've got no complaints.  Everything's, you know...  Listen.  Where's home base?  Florida now.  Florida.  Yeah.  You blew off Florida.  That's vacationing, by the way.  Right.  Why not Long Island?  Because just the weather up here sucks.  Yeah, what the fuck's the matter with you?  You're fucking leaving Long Island.  You're leaving your roots.  I split. 
[02:07:30]  Fucking A.  I was going to move back up here this year, but after the winter you guys just had, screw  that.  It's miserable.  You want beaches and shit?  What's wrong with Ron Conkuma?  The Conk, motherfucker.  The Conk.  Ron Conkuma.  Tremendous.  What part of Florida?  Lake Mary.  It's like 20 minutes north of Orlando.  Oh, that's a nice area.  It's a nice, quiet area.  Not a lot of people.  Right.  You know?  A lot of wrestlers are down there.  In Florida.  Yeah, I know.  In Florida.  None of the undesirables live there, so, you know. 
[02:08:00]  That's how you can tell he's from Long Island.  Yeah, yeah.  I love it.  I love it.  All right.  Why is Tampa so big for ex-wrestlers?  Well, the Hulk's from there.  Oh.  The Blue Meanie, I think.  Blue Meanie?  I don't know.  You just pull the Blue Meanie's name out of your ass?  I think he's from there, right, Sam?  No.  Yeah, the Blue Meanie's from there.  Who else?  Is that where the Hulk's house was that he couldn't go to when he was on his boat?  It's one of our favorites.  Yep.  Hulk does live there.  I almost made it to that house, by the way. 
[02:08:30]  I almost made it to that.  Yeah.  And then, well, you'd have been trespassing, too.  He, uh, he, uh, well, no, you know, there was a little time there where, uh, me and his  lovely daughter were, uh, recording.  An item?  Yes.  And, uh, so I almost made it to the house.  Did you get it in?  Oh, Jesus.  What?  That's how the kids say it.  That's what she said.  I just say that.  Like, I just say that like a whole, but that's how the kids sound like I want to know, too.  I want to talk like the kids.  She's really excited, man.  Wow, she's fantastic.  Brooke is beautiful. 
[02:09:00]  Beautiful.  I mean, that's a legit six-footer and her bare feet is just put together like a brick shithouse.  The problem is, she's beautiful for guys like you, because you're a big, huge, fucking  in-shape guy.  For guys like us, she looks like a monster.  I think she's hot.  For you guys, it's like a roller coaster.  I think she looks great.  I think she looks like a monster with a pretty face.  I like, I love her.  She's totally proportionate.  I want to have sex with a giant.  Well, well, it's not a problem.  Does she have nice feet?  Yeah, she does.  I've recently kind of gotten into feet, and I'm like, she's a big girl. 
[02:09:30]  She probably has nice, big, sexy, well-shaped feet.  I like those big ones that look like talons.  A lot of ligaments.  She took great care of herself.  Beautiful girl.  Had a lot of fun.  How long did you do?  Damn you.  Wow.  About two months.  Oh, okay.  That's all it takes.  I decided to go back, get back together with my ex-girlfriend.  Who's now my ex-girlfriend again.  You blew the Hogan fortune on an ex?  Yes, I did.  Jimmy, you've got ten seconds.  Let me have it.  How long did you last with your ex?  Let me have it. 
[02:10:00]  Call me every name in the book.  Well, how long did you last with your ex when you went back?  A year.  Wow.  But why did you leave the first time?  Or why did you break up the first time?  It's just one of those things where, you know, one month on, one month off, you know, couldn't  handle the lifestyle.  Ron Valeri gave me the best advice ever.  He says, if you're thinking of going back to your ex, don't.  It was as simple as that.  It can never work.  It was as simple as that.  He goes, when you start thinking, wait, maybe you can work this time around.  He goes, do not do that.  Here's a funny story you guys will like.  So, I had seen, you know, Brooke had come to a bunch of the shows and she was actually 
[02:10:30]  involved in my storyline with Hulk.  And so, Brooke would always come up to me and she'd always be talking to me and then we  exchanged numbers.  We'd text and, you know, she'd always be like, do you like me?  Do you like me?  Do you like me?  I mean, some real third grade shit.  You know, I thought she was going to hand me one of those origami things and, you know,  you know.  B-L-R-U-E.  So, we started talking and we started hanging out a little bit and Hulk says, I'd like to 
[02:11:00]  talk to you.  And my Hulk voice is kind of like my Vince voice.  He goes, I want to talk to you.  He goes, I'd like to talk to you about my daughter.  And I said, Hulk, before you go any farther, you don't have to say another word.  You don't have to worry.  I'm ultra respectful.  I would never do anything, you know, bad to your daughter or anything like that.  He goes, no, you don't understand.  I'm warning you about my daughter.  Oh, wow.  No kidding.  I swear.  It was surreal.  Here's Hulk Hogan telling me, my daughter has eyes for you.  You better be careful because what Brooke wants, Brooke gets. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, that was a pretty crazy moment.  And how and why did that end?  Yeah.  Like I said, I just, I don't know.  I went back with my ex.  I could have been the heir to the Hogan fortune.  After a couple of months, though, with a girl, even if your ex, you want to go back, it's  still pretty new.  Were things fading?  Something's up.  Like, kind of after two months, were you like, yeah, this is probably the future?  He's being polite.  No, no, I know. 
[02:12:00]  I know exactly what happened.  Tell me.  She's a bit of a bimbo.  No.  And after the hotness wore off, you're like, oh, boy.  No.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  I have nothing to talk about.  Listen, you guys are giving me some prime real estate here.  I'd be honest with you.  If she was a bimbo, if she didn't have brains, I would say.  Demanding?  No.  She was cool as hell.  But she was cool as hell.  She's bald and wears a bandana.  No.  And other than the five inches she was packing, there was nothing wrong with her.  Exactly.  Who would settle for that on a tall girl? 
[02:12:30]  That's embarrassingly smart.  I know what happened.  What?  She started bench pressing more than you.  And that bothered me.  And so you had to say, I got to go.  No.  Just one of those things.  Just one of those things.  She is super.  She was in here.  Like, her long, she has, like, long, well-shaped legs.  She's very sexy, but she's really, I mean, she's huge.  Not in a slobby bad way, but for you, it would be playing on a big toy, you know?  Yes.  I would look ridiculous.  Like a bouncy house with her.  Yeah.  That would be fucking great.  I would love to date someone like her and have her just dominate me and put her fingers 
[02:13:00]  in my mouth, whether I liked it or not.  Wow.  Yeah.  I could see that, Jimmy.  That would be awesome.  She's got a fish hook, yeah.  So then you get back together with the ex, and then it goes bad again.  Well, just because of, you know, my schedule and my lifestyle and just, you know, she led  a very nine-to-five life, you know?  And you're on the road all the time.  I mean, I've been on the road for 20 years.  I've been living out of a suitcase for 20 years.  I mean, with WWE, I was on the road 300 days a year.  300?  300 days a year for six years. 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  Crazy.  Because back then, I mean, you guys remember, that was when, I mean, we were rock stars.  Oh, yeah.  That's when, you know, the Attitude Era and things were just off the charts.  Crazy.  Now, with TNA, you know, I'm on the road about 150 days a year with them, and then probably  another 50 days a year doing outside stuff, like going back and forth to Japan and wrestling  there.  So, I'm just still totally, you know.  That's a lot of time still, 200 days a year.  Yep.  Wow.  You know, different planes, different hotel rooms, different, you know, different cars,  different chicks.  You know, it gets rough.  How do you, uh... 
[02:14:00]  200 days, that's, you know, a little less than 30 weeks a year.  You can't be squeezed in a fucking coach when you fly, right?  No, thank God, I'm not in a coach, yeah.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Yeah.  A bit gay.  You like being on the road that much?  I do.  You do?  I mean, I knew I was signing up for one.  I wanted to be a pro...  I wanted to be three things when I was a kid.  I wanted to be a pro wrestler, I wanted to be a rock star, and I wanted to be in porn.  So, so far, I've done two out of three.  And since Meatloaf cornered the market on the 300-pound front man, I'm shit out of luck with  that one.  Ah, Meatloaf. 
[02:14:30]  He's a strange bird.  He is a strange bird.  We've had him in a couple.  We like him, though.  He's a good...  Because this will get back to him again.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he said he was looking up YouTube videos or something.  He won't watch himself.  He's strange, but...  No, he's...  He's entertaining as all.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a fun guest.  Right.  Yeah.  So what are you doing now?  Are you in a relationship?  Yes, actually, I am in a relationship.  You just said no.  What are you, crazy?  No, I thought you were going to ask me a different question, but yes, I am involved with somebody. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Is that going well?  It's going awesome.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Bruno San Martino's daughter?  Yeah.  Who's daughter is it?  No, no, no.  Who's daughter?  No.  It's somebody's daughter, right?  Right.  Somebody's daughter, yeah.  They all are.  I haven't met that somebody, though, yet.  But how's that going to work if you're still on the road a lot?  Well, she's on the road also.  Ah.  Oh.  Are we going to get a scoop today?  Oh.  Are you dating a wrestler?  I am.  I am currently involved with a young lady in the wrestling business, yes. 
[02:15:30]  Do you know?  I do not.  Wow.  If Sam Roberts doesn't know, would we know?  Sam will definitely know.  You guys might know, because I know you guys are not like on the wrestling bandwagon.  Is it a diva?  On the wrestling bandwagon.  Moolah!  Moolah.  Moolah's dead, Jimmy.  That doesn't mean you can't be with her daughter.  That makes it on your own mind.  Is it a diva?  She's one of the TNA knockouts.  Oh, right.  A knockout.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, go ahead, Sam.  You get one shot at this.  I don't know who it is.  Stop looking sexy against the wall like you're James Dean with your fucking denim shoes. 
[02:16:00]  Those are vans.  They're awful.  Sam wears vans.  I wish Susan Smith was driving it.  What?  You're looking up TNA knockouts?  Who is it?  All right.  Let's see.  Sam's coming over to Bully Ray.  No, not that one.  She was an on-screen.  That was one of the girls I had on-screen.  She was my last on, you know.  On-screen.  I said on-screen three times. 
[02:16:30]  No, it's not Brooke.  It's the lovely Miss Velvet Sky.  All right.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Is that her real name?  She came bobsledding out of a mother's uterus, and she said,  Oh, look, Velvet.  Let me see what she looks like, Sam.  She's a tomato.  All right.  Let's see.  I am much hotter than Brooke.  That's an upgrade, right?  Of course it is.  Normal-sized girl.  What?  Wow.  What do you guys think? 
[02:17:00]  That's a pretty nice.  She's very nice there.  That's good, because you're both on the road together.  You've got to be his size to handle a girl like this,  because every guy is going to want to hook up with her.  Yeah, you've got to know how to beat some people up.  You have to be his size to be able to go out with her,  because there's going to be problems.  Right.  And she wants a guy who could probably keep other guys away from her.  She is more of a man than any man in this room right now.  Let's not say much.  I know that I've said that about girls that day.  I always tell her she's one chromosome away from eight inches.  She's a dude. 
[02:17:30]  She's an obese man trapped in a really hot girl's body.  Damn.  Wow.  She poses really nice.  Congrats.  That's pretty fucking nice.  The outfit's too flimsy.  She should cover up a little bit.  I totally agree.  Before you bring her home to mom.  Wow.  Yeah, that's cool.  She's great.  When you're on the road, do you go cheap, or do you take care of yourself?  No, because McFoley's been in here, and he tells his stories.  In Flint.  They're the best.  His cheap stories.  He's still renting a Scirocco. 
[02:18:00]  Scirocco.  Wow, that's a Long Island car, too.  Maybe it's a car for everyone, but that was a big one, a Long Island.  Mick's an awesome guy, but yes, he'll stay in a red roof every single day.  No, he was telling us he would sleep on couches of fans.  Absolutely.  When he was the champion.  There you go.  Him and Austin used to have contests, both when they were making a gazillion dollars a year,  who could rent the cheapest rental car?  And Mick was notorious for wearing the same pair of underwear for three, four days straight. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, wow.  Why that?  I don't know.  Damn.  I have no idea.  Some fucking skidmars in there.  Mick's soup.  Mick Foley's underwear probably don't smell good three minutes after he puts them on.  He looks like that's how he got it.  Five, three days.  Wow, man.  Wow, that's right.  And what are you doing for fun, besides velvet?  That's your down time. 
[02:19:00]  What do you like to do?  I try to catch as many rock and roll shows as possible.  What bands?  I need to.  Old school, ACDC, Kiss, Motley Crue, the whole nine yards.  So, you know, looking forward to...  Jimmy, I'm digging your show.  Oh, thanks, man.  Did you have...  On Ozzy Bullion?  Yep.  Thank you.  It's all good.  Yeah.  Keith Roth has got a good show on there, too, and a bunch of those guys.  See, this is a great cross-promotion of the platform.  I know.  Are you allowed to do that or not?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Florentine show.  We just don't want to. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, I love that.  I know Florentine, like, for over 20 years.  Like, he wrote a book back in the day, like, How to Score with Chicks.  I remember that.  He autographed it to me.  I still have my autographed copy of Florentine's book.  Holy shit, that's hilarious.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I remember Jim when he did a book on tape for that.  How to Score with Chicks.  Yeah, How to Score with Chicks.  And then, like, page five, you know, get a cheek peak.  You know, it was all this fucking funny Jim shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to read that.  That's funny.  It's definitely a funny book.  Timeless.  How's TNA treating you? 
[02:20:00]  TNA's treating me great.  Are the ratings good?  Are you getting fans out?  Like, where are we at with this?  We'd love to be moving forward a little bit quicker.  But, you know, we do the same rating every week.  We get about 1.5 to 2 million viewers.  It's a great product.  That's nice.  We just need to get the name out there a little bit more.  And on June 25th, 26th, and 27th, we're going to be here in New York City for the first time doing television at the Manhattan Center.  So it's a pretty big deal for us.  Maybe we go.  We should go.  We should go, maybe.  I would love for you guys to come. 
[02:20:30]  You guys supported me back when I was in WWE.  I know wrestling's not right up your alley these days, but...  I mean, the era from when we were at AEW, that was just crazy.  I don't know if they'll ever get back to that point.  TNA is definitely looking to move into a little bit of a mature, adult-oriented...  A little edgier?  Yes.  Definitely want to get a little edgier.  Who are some of the guys that are over at TNA with you that we would know?  Did you know Jeff Hardy?  Sure.  Kurt Angle?  Sure.  How's Kurt?  Kurt's doing good.  Is he doing good? 
[02:21:00]  He really is.  Is he doing good?  No, he's really doing well.  He's much better.  He scared us a little bit.  I don't know what's going on with him.  I have no fucking idea, but he seemed a little different from the NAW days when he used to come in.  No, he's really doing well.  Good.  And we've had a bunch of guys that you would know who've come in and out of there.  Obviously, Hulk was there, and Sting was there, and Steiner was there, and Booker T was there.  Right.  But they treat me great.  I enjoy being there, and I just like being in a smaller company right now where I can do what they've got to do, and I do what I want to do. 
[02:21:30]  How often are you in the gym?  About five days a week.  Five days a week?  Yep.  I got up this morning at about 5 o'clock, popped to Adderall, benched about 4 at 95.  I came here to talk to you wonderful gentlemen.  Do you really benched 4 at 95?  Yeah.  For reps.  For reps.  For reps.  Jesus Christ.  How many reps?  About two.  How much cardio do you do?  I get very tuckered out very quickly.  Very tuckered.  Tuckered out. 
[02:22:00]  You're really pushing 4 at 95.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Speaking of 4 at 95, Long Island.  Long Island.  The good old 4 at 95.  One of the most miserable stretches.  Other than the 4 at 5 in LA, probably one of the most miserable stretches of expression.  I think 4 at 95 is worse.  4 at 5 is a hunk of shit, man.  I believe that.  It's the worst.  It's the only reason why I live in the city.  I gave up on Long Island because of that fucking 4 at 95.  Period.  I couldn't handle it anymore.  At least on the 4 at 95, you can kind of judge. 
[02:22:30]  There's an hour here, an hour there where you may be able to travel, get through.  The 4 at 5 in LA, it's constantly just packed with people.  It's horrible.  It's annoying because there's so many lanes.  It's like you have 37 lanes.  How does this not move at all?  Oh, stop traffic.  That's a bad road, man.  Sorry, I do about five days of cardio, Jimmy.  No public training.  I mean, I was a lot.  Last time I showed you guys, I looked different.  I was heavier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just decided.  Were you heavier?  You were heavier, but not muscle heavy.  Yeah, yeah, I wasn't. 
[02:23:00]  I wasn't.  You're cut.  Yeah.  So I was probably, I don't know, about 325 then.  Now I'm 275, ripped, chiseled, and jacked.  Wow.  The bench barbell plates, eat Tebow's and steaks.  You know, the old stupid star Billy Graham shit.  Steroids?  No.  Jesus.  No.  What?  That's a good question.  He likes getting right to the fucking bottom of it.  I did it all clean.  Yeah.  Even back in the day when they all were doing it, Kevin?  I didn't look like that back in the day.  That's true.  You were soft.  That's true, yeah.  You're softer than you are now.  You just said that.  Jimmy, he called me soft. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't care for that either, but I wasn't going to mention it.  You were soft.  You said it.  Yeah, you were like, you know, you were kind of Pillsbury Dope Boy-ish.  You were like a 150-pound tube on the gun, Bob.  How many, how many, how many, how many, how many?  I got to tell you just something really funny.  Quick.  Last night, you know, I put on Twitter that I was going to be here because I really appreciate  you guys having me.  And a bunch of your fans were begging me, begging me, begging me not to tell.  Oh, I don't care.  Honestly, I don't care.  Not to tell the infamous story.  I don't want to piss off any of your listeners. 
[02:24:00]  No, we've told it over the years.  I started to think to myself, I'm like, who else was in that limo that day?  That was my, that was my girlfriend at the time who I was with for like 10 years.  And then you went back to after Hulk?  No, no, no, no, no.  After Hulk, after Hulk, Jesus.  After me and Hulk dated for two months.  No, the story is simple.  You came in to any W and I was ready to get on the train.  You're like, dude, I'll, I'll, I'll drive you.  I got the limo.  Why did you have a limo that day?  Because we were doing a media tour and your show was part of it.  And they picked me up in Long Island. 
[02:24:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  WWE, you know, back in the days, you know, limousine riding, jet flying.  Money to be spent.  Yes.  And I was loving it, but I was sitting on the side, which is the worst place to be in  a limo.  Get a little sick in the limo.  And we were having a good time.  I was really digging, talking to you and stuff.  And then I'm like, oh man, I, I, I might fucking puke.  This is going to be the worst.  It's the worst.  And then soon as we pulled over on the service road, I was fucking puking.  And there's, there's probably just fucking pointing and laughing.  Oh, you actually got out and puked and got back in? 
[02:25:00]  No, I was done.  I, I made it to my stop.  But as soon as I got out, I had someone picking me up.  Oh, you almost, you could have fucking like.  Why, why drive me all the way home?  Right, Bubba?  Yeah.  You're the one who said you could drop me off right here on the service road.  Yeah.  On the service road.  Yeah, we'll slow the car down.  Yeah, I actually made a rule.  And you weren't that big of a star then, so the service road was fine too.  I had to make calls like, meet me on the service road.  I think it was Deer Park Avenue, if I remember correctly.  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  And as soon as I got out, I'm fucking just hurling.  And he's just laughing, pointing and laughing. 
[02:25:30]  It takes off in mid-puke.  You almost made it without him seeing?  Yeah.  No, I saw every bit of it, heard every bit of it.  I was hurt.  Every chunk that came out of his guts was on the side of the L.I.  Damn.  I was hurt, man.  So.  Shit.  I've been instructed to ask you about a promo I saw on EC3.  What was the name?  I don't remember the name.  What?  I vaguely remember the promo.  What?  Do you remember?  I don't know.  Sam, mic's up.  Yeah, go ahead.  You good?  You don't sound right.  It doesn't matter.  It never sounds good. 
[02:26:00]  Do you remember when we played the TNA promo that Jim saw watching Impact?  Oh, no.  And we spent like 20 minutes on it.  Really?  I swear to you.  They watched one of EC3's promos on the air.  Oh.  And Jim took it apart.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Piece by piece.  Yeah.  It wasn't exactly cinematic excellence, Jimmy?  Oh, that was...  I remember now.  Yeah, I don't remember.  He was horrible.  Do you know EC3?  I just wrestled him the other night in a Texas death match.  Sorry.  That's okay.  I only vaguely...  Are EC3 is a guy? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, I don't remember.  I thought that was the name of the league.  Baba, his mic skills were not as good as yours.  I'll just say that much.  He's a young...  You're very good on the mic, and he...  I mean, this was a few years ago, so he probably...  Look, I'm trying to spin this.  He probably is better.  What did it sound like?  It was a few days ago.  Do we have any of it?  Play a second of it.  I vaguely remember the incident, but I don't remember...  I've got to make we.  He's a good up-and-coming wrestler.  I've got to make we.  Are you going to...  All right.  Well, we can take a break, then.  Yes, we can come back. 
[02:27:00]  Why don't we take a break, and then we'll get...  Okay.  Let's do it that way.  Perfect.  And we'll get a little bit of that...  Boba Ray Dudley, of course.  Bully Ray on TNA...  What is it?  Impact Wrestling.  Awesome.  Awesome.  How you got through that one, that was awesome.  I don't watch anymore.  Thanks for watching.  I care about the guys that we know from the past, but I don't watch.  But maybe I will now, because you came on the show.  I don't know.  Next Wednesday through Friday.  I want you guys to come to the show.  I didn't realize it was this soon.  Next Wednesday through Friday, 25th through 27th, they're here in the Manhattan Center Grand 
[02:27:30]  Ballroom.  Show starts at 7.  You can go to Ticketmaster.  They start at 20 bucks, which is really great.  I didn't realize it was that close.  Yeah, maybe I will go to that.  I would love you guys to come.  Why sit there for three days?  You're taping a whole bunch of...  We're taping a bunch of TV shows there.  So let's go.  Yeah.  And you guys got to come, because like I said, I'm guaranteeing the wrestling world...  The owner of the company, her name is Dixie Carter.  Right.  And she is absolutely despised and hated within the wrestling industry, in and out of the  ring.  Right.  And I am going to give her the Mae Young treatment, and I am going to put her through a table. 
[02:28:00]  Whoa.  Very cool.  That's...  You got to come to see this.  I don't know.  I'm going to try to get my hands on her one of the three nights.  Well, tell us what night is the cool night behind the scenes.  Okay.  I'll tell you the cool night behind the scenes.  No, I mean, where you're going to, you know, be doing a lot of cool stuff.  Screw the rest of the guys.  I don't care about them.  I'm going to do cool stuff every single night.  You guys got to come.  All right.  We will do that.  More with Bubba Ray Dudley, of course, Bully Ray, in just a bit.  It's like a challenge.  I don't know.  Oh, you know what you're playing?  Remember the game Simon?  Yeah.  That's what you're playing now, when Opie's got to turn the mics on, because it's like, 
[02:28:30]  I got to remember what buttons were pushed.  I think I got all of them.  But this Anthony's not you anymore, right?  Well, that sounds weird.  No.  Okay, so that's off.  No, that's, yeah.  I'm way at the end, I think.  They just don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  It's amazing.  Look at this.  There's a mic cord stretched from one of the guest mics to mine, because supposedly we  do well for it, too.  Aren't you guys like a high-rated show?  Supposedly.  That's what I heard.  It doesn't match up.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck. 
[02:29:00]  Actually, this is the best treatment you can get, because the other shows, they'll actually  walk by and throw piss bags at them while they're on the end.  We're on the non-colostomy treatment list, which is actually pretty good.  I've got to ask you guys one question.  Yes.  What's with all the hatred for the World Cup?  It's not hatred.  It's misunderstanding.  It's indifference.  Indifference.  That's a good word.  Explain it.  I love it.  It's my favorite sport.  Wow.  Soccer is your favorite.  I love soccer.  It's my favorite sport.  Why?  Because of the passion of the game.  There is no more passionate sport, and there's no more passionate fans than soccer fans. 
[02:29:30]  Now, soccer fans in the United States are good, but when you see soccer like in Europe,  like the English Premier League or the Italian League, you're talking about a different  level.  Stuff over there makes Yankees' Red Sox look like sandbox play.  Right.  That's how into it the people are, so I just love the passion of the game.  Well, that used to be wars back in the day.  Yeah, exactly.  Just go and conquer each other.  That's right.  That's why they have that, because they remember, hey, you killed my grandfather.  It's true. 
[02:30:00]  Like, the two teams over there, Celtic and Rangers.  Basically, it's the Protestants versus the Catholics.  Oh, wow.  And when they get together, it's a whooping good time.  Some hooligans in the crowd, too, huh?  Yes.  They mean business.  Yes.  I don't know.  We were talking about it.  Like, when you get three shots on goal the whole game, you're kind of like, ah.  Do you get a lot of guys running?  Do you actually watch entire matches?  The entire game.  It's only an hour and a half game.  No, I know that.  It's a short game.  I know it feels like an eternity sometimes with the lack of scoring, but yesterday, Brazil and Mexico, 
[02:30:30]  that's the most exciting 0-0 game you'll see.  Wow, really?  But do you feel a little empty?  No.  Although Mexico, like, that's a big deal for Mexico, obviously.  Watching a game like that is kind of like having tantric sex.  You don't necessarily have to come to Mexico.  Jimmy, cue the one-liner.  And you don't have to pretend you like Sting's music.  Tantric sex sounds good, but I've never really done it. 
[02:31:00]  But here's quite a lot, because you want to come.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Who has that patience?  To me, I'm just so greedy.  Jim, you're going to feel like Tweedle Tweedle on the nips.  Done!  Out!  What's the next thing?  We're supposed to listen to a talk?  How did you get a soccer on Long Island?  You played it as a kid?  I never played it as a kid.  I just always appreciated the game.  I enjoyed playing it, like, recreationally.  And then when soccer finally made its way over here to the United States, we could see the European leagues. 
[02:31:30]  Just loved watching it.  Always into it.  So you're watching, even if it's not the World Cup?  Religiously.  Wow.  Okay.  I follow the English Premier League and the Italian League every year, just like I would follow Major League Baseball or the NFL.  What are the commercials like there?  Because someone said that they never got a tremendous amount of play here, because it's hard to do commercials.  Well, that's why soccer will never take off in the United States, because you can't do commercials.  It's 45 minutes of, you know, unstopped play.  So you can't, you only have 15 minutes at halftime to really shill your, you know, your product.  So it's all stuff like advertising on the wall, like behind home plate. 
[02:32:00]  Okay.  Yep.  Shit.  That's just not enough to keep it going, I guess.  Well, can't they put up, like, CNN graphics or something, but sponsors?  You know what I mean?  Now they can, probably.  Right.  And plus, like, if you take a look at sports in the United States, they've watered down sports so much,  so there's more scoring, because, you know, here we need, we need that.  People love scoring, yeah.  Exactly.  Yep.  Exactly.  That's it.  Europe has a different mentality, and I just appreciate the game a lot.  Mmm.  Fair enough.  I wish I liked it.  It's such a fucking massive sport, but. 
[02:32:30]  I watched USA versus Ghana.  It was, you know, I was into it a little bit for a while, but.  And then.  I don't know.  A lot of hot chicks at the World Cup.  Tons of them.  Yeah.  Brazilian chicks.  Italian chicks.  Mexican chicks.  Yeah.  Yep.  I saw those, I said it yesterday, a lot of those girls for some of these teams, they  just all look like Jesse Orozco.  They all fucking have that Jesse Orozco face.  Oh my God.  Wow. 
[02:33:00]  You've traveled the world.  Where are the hottest chicks?  Scandinavia.  Like Finland, Sweden, around Prague.  Say that stuff there.  They're all over the block.  Big, every girl looks like big Brooke Hogan.  Yeah.  All the ugly ones, really hot, as far as American standards go.  They're all gorgeous.  Wow.  Vikings.  Great skin, beautiful blonde hair, blue eyes.  Nice.  Nice.  And very scantily clad.  Nice.  Wow.  Nice people? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Or do they have the attitudes?  No.  You know where you get the attitudes?  In France.  Wow.  Everyone says that.  France is the shits.  What's wrong with them?  They're miserable.  And even more miserable than the actual French in France are French Canadians in Montreal.  Right.  They hate everybody.  We ran into a couple of them.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Montreal.  I loved Montreal.  Montreal was fun.  It's a great city to party in, but I mean, I've been, it's one of my least favorite places  to perform. 
[02:34:00]  I just never.  Why?  I just don't.  I'm not a fan of the people.  They're very rude.  They make New Yorkers look like, you know, Quakers.  Our fans up there, when we broadcasted live last year at the comedy festival, they were  really polite.  And we're like, man, maybe this isn't working today.  But then they would, you know, laugh pretty hard when it was time, I guess.  Yeah, they were cool.  I'm pretty lazy to hate, so whatever.  What about Japan?  Japan is my absolute favorite place in the world to perform. 
[02:34:30]  I don't want to go there badly.  It's awesome.  You like the culture and all that?  Love the culture.  And pro wrestlers in Japan are treated like absolute gods.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you feel like a god, too, because you're so much bigger than everybody.  Oh, you must stand out.  You definitely do.  Walking down the street.  Me and my partner, D-Von, like, I'm not trying to sound like a big shot here or anything,  but like, we can't, it's hard to walk the streets.  Oh, shit.  They all know you there, right?  Yeah.  I mean, we've been going there for over 15 years.  We've never lost a match in Japan.  And we're pretty decorated over there as far as being champions. 
[02:35:00]  So, you know, they see us on the streets, and they just mob us.  Wow.  It's cool.  You ever go with a Japanese girl?  Yeah.  I've never done that.  It's a lot of fun.  Nice.  Here's my favorite story.  I got in my hotel room one time, and I get a knock at the door.  I look, I open the door, and I hear, uh, yes, Mr. Bubba Ray, maybe I come inside, and  we have conversation?  I said, sure, come on inside.  We can talk about whatever you'd like to talk about.  Whoa!  Ah! 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  They know their role.  Damn.  Japanese groupies know their role.  That's nice.  Wow.  Is she pretty?  Very pretty, but over there, uh, sometimes, uh, their teeth are, you know, they don't  have a lot of dentists.  Oh, well, let's be honest, they haven't had a whole lot.  Oh, wait, they have, they're bad teeth?  Yeah.  Oh, I never noticed that.  Is that from the sushi?  I don't know what it's from.  I think there's some fucking, you know, genetic thing going on.  Really?  You could say that.  Do you mean dirty teeth or just crooked?  What do you mean it's genetic?  Crooked. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe the water.  It could happen.  Maybe they don't have fluoride.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  A lot of people, uh, don't, uh, with political correctness and shit.  A lot of people don't want to talk about it, but there are definitely genetic things  as far as skull shape and things like that, that you could trace back to certain, uh, you  know, people on the globe.  Yeah.  He's not like, I mean, they can tell if you were black or white by your skeleton, I think.  Yeah.  Isn't that crazy?  Exactly.  And, you know, sometimes, well, sometimes history.  Jimmy the Greek.  Jimmy the Greek talked about that and, uh, he did very well. 
[02:36:30]  No, he didn't.  Oh, did they toss his ass right out.  Wow.  Quickly, too.  He was like the first one to lose his gig over some PC thing, I think.  But Howard Cosell also.  He didn't lose his gig.  He didn't lose his gig for that one.  Yeah.  And he never said, look at that little monkey run.  What did he say?  He said something like, uh...  He said monkey.  He's running like a monkey or something.  It wasn't, look at that little monkey run.  It was like, he took off like a monkey or something.  And nowadays, that would just get you fucking a firing squad. 
[02:37:00]  Never mind, fired.  But, uh...  How about...  But, you know, just...  Did you guys see the Don Rickles roast?  Uh, no.  No, I...  I still haven't seen it.  They got away with some stuff on that show that I was shocked.  Like, you know, it was on Spike TV.  And, you know, it was probably the edgiest I've seen them get with, like, you know, some black humor.  And so, you know, Don Rickles was known for that for years.  But it wasn't him doing the shtick.  It was everybody else doing, you know, doing it. 
[02:37:30]  Editing a Rickles roast, though, you'd look so bad.  Like, this is the guy you're going to honor, but you're going to edit all this shit, you know?  Uh-huh.  Even though they probably would do that.  The only...  I mean, they let everybody kind of say and do whatever they want.  I mean, they edited the F-bombs, but everything else they left in.  And I was shocked.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I think because it was Rickles.  Yeah, that's probably why.  And it was on Spike, which is an edgiest station.  And it was on from, like, 9 to 11.  So it was a cool show, though.  They call that Watershed.  The Watershed time. 
[02:38:00]  Get a new rulebook.  Get a new rulebook.  Guilty.  Guilty.  Guilty.  What else about Japan?  I'm obsessed with Japan.  It's just great.  People are weirdos, right, with their sexuality, though?  Sex is definitely weird.  They're into some weird stuff over there.  Like, you know, puking on each other and licking each other's eyeballs.  And, you know, you can go to a vending machine in Japan and buy, like, teenage girls underwear.  Ooh. 
[02:38:30]  Not that I ever put $5 in.  I think you've got to do it just to...  How do you know?  But I don't...  That wouldn't be great.  How do you know it's authentic?  A clean panty.  I don't want some clean under-fucking shorts.  Are they dirty or clean?  I said, supposedly, they're used.  I don't know.  I think you've got to do it just to see, I guess.  You know, you're a tourist and all, but I don't...  It's not necessarily my thing.  I need to smell fucking girls underwear.  But why do you want to go to Japan?  I don't know, because it's so different.  A hand can be used like a knife.  Right.  And it's expensive, too.  It is.  It's such a different culture. 
[02:39:00]  I've been performing there for years, and it's great.  They take great care of you.  The culture's great.  I love the food.  Did you read that sushi place, that Jiro guy?  Is that his name?  Jiro, Jiro, whatever.  Jiro.  Jiro.  Like, what was the name of the name?  Jiro Dreams of Sushi.  The documentary was boring, but I mean, he's...  Tiny little place, I think, right outside a subway or something.  No.  You like sushi, though?  Love it.  Do you get the weird stuff over there?  The blowfish that can kill you?  I've had it. 
[02:39:30]  I've had it.  Liked it.  The only thing I really don't like is the...  What's it called?  That mushy sea urchin.  The sea urchin.  I actually like that.  Do you really?  I do.  It feels like a load in the back of your throat.  I guess we answered each other's question.  I don't eat it.  I just throw it on my face and back.  No, if it smells like the ocean, though, fucking don't eat it, because I think you can really  tell if that stuff's bad.  Like, if you smell it, it smells...  Pussy.  Yeah, exactly.  Sea urchin definitely is rank. 
[02:40:00]  I love it, though.  If it's well done, it's really good.  I didn't like it until I ate it at Yasuda.  The guy finally said, you've got to try it, because I said the exact same stuff.  I'm like, that's the only thing I don't like.  And he...  I guess they get better stuff down there.  Now, wait a minute, Jimmy.  You just said if it's good, if it's well done.  So you've had it cooked.  Oh, no.  I mean well done, like well prepared.  Well prepared.  Okay.  Fresh.  But if it smells like a little bit fishy, it's like I won't touch any of that stuff.  Sushi's pretty easy to tell if it's bad, I think, if you smell it.  Go to Yasuda.  Good?  It's amazing.  It's amazing, yeah.  Anthony Bourdain turned me on to it, and I'm obsessed with that place, too.  Cool. 
[02:40:30]  We try to go like once a month, once every two months.  Yasuda?  Amazing.  I'll tell them you sent me.  Yeah.  Now you don't know.  That'll get...  They don't know.  They don't know.  Can you give me a free hot towel?  They don't know or care who I am in that place.  Maybe I'll take a nice young lady to Yasuda.  That's what I need to do.  Find a nice young lady.  Go sushi bar.  Tables, not as good.  Why?  No.  No, because they did...  I mean, it's so much fresher.  Like you're getting these pieces one at a time.  Kind of like the place in L.A.  Well, it's only by a couple of minutes.  No, it's different.  Bring a nice young lady there. 
[02:41:00]  Plus, you have to order at the table, and the guy behind the sushi bar, he's looking  at you, and he's suggesting things and stuff.  It's a nice experience.  I'll throw the guy a fiver to call me by the name of us.  Well, there you go.  Who's that young lady in that picture right there?  And...  Disgraced Miss Colorado, who's now doing porn.  Oh, fuck.  She's hot.  Yeah, there you go.  What is this?  A disgraced former Miss Colorado teen contestant reportedly making porn.  Well, we need to find out if this reportedly is true or not.  I hope it is.  I hear it is. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it's true.  They just are scared to...  There's her, and then there's the Delaware girl.  Teen girl.  She did one, but I think she's not doing it anymore.  Oh, nerds.  I follow her on the Twitter, and she seems to...  Still?  She seems to...  Yeah, you know.  What was the one broad that didn't know the, what, the capital of...  What was the...  It was on the Todd Show.  Yeah.  Oh.  The Todd Show.  He's listening to it.  My name was Pretty McGirl boobs.  Okay.  He got a viral video, because they asked her what was the capital of Nevada.  No way. 
[02:42:00]  Man, she didn't know.  She didn't know.  And she won from there.  He had a viral video recently?  Good for him.  Two days ago.  Oh, that guy's good.  Sorry, I'm eating.  All right, so listen, I'm saving you guys seats in the front row of my show.  You coming?  We're going?  You got to come.  I'm not doing front row.  What do you mean?  What?  We don't do front row.  Okay.  Tenth row.  Yeah.  We don't do front row.  Nice.  In the shadows.  I like being in the shadows.  I'm not going to put you on TV.  No, we were supposed to be in coffins. 
[02:42:30]  The coffin seats in Worcester.  For any W.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Scorch.  For WWE.  And what happened?  We didn't want to be in the coffins.  Why not?  Because he looked like a jackass.  Yeah.  But this guy Scorch, who also worked at the radio station.  I'll take him.  When we told him we didn't want to be in the coffins, he was all about it.  He was very excited.  What if we bring you in the ring and we let you hit somebody over the head with a chair?  Nah, I would look like a goofball.  Wasn't it an Undertaker match?  I think so.  Yeah, the Undertaker was doing something and they wanted us to lay in the coffins. 
[02:43:00]  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  You would do that?  Of course he would.  I would do it.  I'd lay in a coffin just to be silly.  But for the whole taping, you're in the coffin.  No, I'd have to tinkle.  We ended up way in the back.  We were standing up just watching.  And to look at Scorch in the coffin, we just kept laughing at each other.  He was so happy.  Me and I should never hate us.  So you don't have any pro wrestling fantasy that you want to live out?  God, no.  You're so past that.  No. 
[02:43:30]  You're even making the bitter beer face like, oh my God.  I'll tell you why.  Because you've got to look the part.  I obviously don't look the part.  When radio guys and stuff do that, they look like fucking goofballs.  You could be like David Arquette.  Yeah, he looked like a good boy.  Thank you.  You just proved my point.  Prime example right there.  I'm not trying to say I'm too cool for that shit.  No, it's more like you just look like an asshole.  Yeah.  There's no way to look cool unless you're a bigger guy.  Unless you're a big guy that knows how to work it.  Take a hit the right way or make it look good.  Selling the whole fucking move. 
[02:44:00]  You look like an idiot.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Say I would in a second.  We'll put you in the balcony.  You'll be good.  I'd love to see you as a chair on somebody.  Yeah, they hit you so hard your denim shoes fall off.  I don't know how denim shoes are fucking enraging.  I really think I'm going to go next week.  I hope you guys come.  I'm serious.  That would be fun, man.  Get a seat in the balcony or something so we can check out the whole scene.  It's a different wrestling experience.  You're not going all out crazy with explosions and stuff, are you? 
[02:44:30]  What do you mean like pyro and stuff?  Yeah.  No.  No.  What league is starting that up?  What?  I was just reading about it the other day where they're going ridiculously extreme, like  crazy extreme.  Is that guy's promo bad?  Oh, you want to play that?  I don't remember.  But he might have liked the guy.  I'm sure he does.  He's probably a great guy.  Who?  Ethan?  He's a piece of shit.  That's great.  I don't like him at all.  He's a piece of shit.  You could bury him all you want.  I don't care. 
[02:45:00]  Sam, you have to hit him.  I'll hit play.  Sam, is that all right?  I have faced a litany of competitions.  Oh, did we bash this guy?  I have faced superstars.  I have faced international talent.  And I have faced legends.  Come on.  This guy's awful already.  But there is one man.  There is one man who's been in the ring with the likes of Andre the Giant. 
[02:45:30]  There's a man who's been in the ring with the likes of Hulk Hogan.  Oh, boy.  Look at his dumb face.  I wish you people could see his face because he looks retarded.  Jim, you're a public speaker, I would say, right?  Yes, I am.  What happens when you take breaks in your speech that are applause breaks and it's just a stagnant noise?  That's only...  The response he got is only good if he's giving a eulogy. 
[02:46:00]  That's the response you want if you're a waxing poetic about a man's life.  Yeah.  And everyone's pausing to think.  Right.  But that did not get an applause.  There is a man who has been in the ring with the likes of Brent Horst.  They're just yelling, you suck.  You don't think it's good?  He's terrible.  I'm saying, is that a bad promo?  It's not a good promo.  Huh?  It's not a good promo.  No, I mean, it's certainly not.  I wouldn't like you.  This...  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  Let's get...  Stop the pain.  Oh, Jeff, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, I mean, no, it's not the best promo that I've ever heard.  Well, you gotta...  Listen, he's still young.  He's up and coming in the business.  Yeah.  It's true.  Company man coming out.  He's young.  He's up and coming in the business.  Company man.  He'll get better.  Yes.  Boy, you're a company man.  You're way better than that, is all we're trying to do.  I'm still...  I still got the other stuff in my ears in the background.  Can you guys hear that?  Oh, really?  Is it still playing?  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, really?  He'll shut it off.  Okay, now it's better.  It's funny that he's just using weird words.  Right.  There are men who have been bilked and duped.  What?  Give us a...  Oh, the referee, right?  Oh.  Give us one good story from your WWE time.  One good solid story.  Behind the scenes or whatever.  Not you, Jimmy.  I'm trying to think of something that you guys would like, and it's funny.  How about me and The Rock and my partner, D-Von, doing YMCA at a gay club in Montreal? 
[02:47:30]  How's that?  That's pretty good.  Drunk at 3 a.m. doing YMCA at an alternative lifestyle bar in Montreal.  Whose idea was it to go to the...  Pat Patterson's.  Oh, okay.  Who I think officially came out, right?  Okay.  Pat Patterson.  It's so funny that Pat just came out, and before I go any farther, Pat Patterson, genius  in the wrestling industry.  Love him.  Great man. 
[02:48:00]  Very good friend.  He's been openly gay forever.  But yeah, we went to one of Pat's places that he likes to sing karaoke.  And we did, and we did, you know, karaoke YMCA.  That's right.  Ironic that he's gay, and his name is Pat Patterson.  Well.  I remember rumors back in the day.  I got to tell you, man.  That time in the wrestling business was just... 
[02:48:30]  It was awesome.  It was like being a rock star.  You guys were rock stars.  It was crazy how popular it got.  That was mid-90s.  Yeah.  WWE New York, the restaurant on the block, just performing at the Garden.  I remember coming on you guys' show right before performing on the Garden one time,  and you had some chick in the studio who said she was the queen of anal.  Oh, wow.  Tristan Taramino.  Wow.  Look at your name.  I remember the day because it was so funny.  So she said that she was the queen of anal, and you guys were known, I don't know if you 
[02:49:00]  still do it, the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Oh, well.  In our private lives alone, we just got retired.  Jimmy finally got to us.  Jimmy basically pulled me aside and said, what the fuck are we doing?  And he was right.  We're going to get arrested.  You were the voice of reason.  Yeah.  More times than you think.  I'm so paranoid about getting fired because I didn't get paid like these guys did.  That's us.  It's like, yeah, whatever.  We'll get another fucking...  Yeah.  I have zero faith.  No, what happened was we were only back, I swear, maybe a month. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe.  Two months.  Yeah, max.  And we had the Jäger Meister machine, and these girls came in with this band.  The band said, hey, man, these girls will come and do crazy shit just so we could play  a song or promote our band.  And long story short, the morning ended with a girl completely naked on 57th Street crying  her eyes out.  But she was drunk before she came in.  I concluded.  And they were doing the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge to each other, but they were so wasted  that they were shoving it in way too far.  Way too deep.  And hurting each other. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  And Jimmy's like, what the fuck?  Yeah, we're like, we just got back on radio.  We're going to get arrested for killing somebody.  Some girl's going to have a...  Or, yeah, some girl's going to have an internal injury with a bat shoved in her box, so we're  going to have to try to explain that.  The one girl tried to leave our studio by walking behind Anthony and banging into a wall  thinking that was the way out.  Tremendous classic.  Not even a hint that there was a door there.  It was fun.  And then maybe other things happened in the back office with other people in the show.  I did fuck one of the girls.  One eventually became Ron in Fez's office with no condom, and I came on the floor. 
[02:50:30]  Well, the girl that was in the studio, I got to tell the rest of her, she was the queen  of anal, and I said, well, why don't you take the whiffle ball back challenge, you know?  Yeah.  Up your noose.  Yeah.  And she didn't want to do it, she didn't want to do it, and I told her, listen, I'll  plug your book in the middle of Madison Square Garden if you do it.  Oh, right.  And you guys looked at me like, are you really going to do that?  I was like, no.  No.  I remember that, yeah.  So she said, well, I have to loosen myself up first.  Right.  And she dropped her drawers, and in a moment of stupidity, I went, hey, what's that white 
[02:51:00]  string hanging out of her?  Oh, right.  Yes.  I remember this now.  The queen of anal.  And I still get people who come to shows holding up signs going, hey, Bubba, what's that white  string?  Oh, really?  Oh, absolutely.  On the old rag-a-rooney.  Yeah.  Well, this was good.  We're a pisser, man.  We've got to end slightly early, because they've got to work.  We've got to try to fix the mics.  That's great.  Work on the microphones.  Yeah.  It's all good, man.  I know it works.  So what do we got?  We've got TNA coming to Manhattan Center next week, Wednesday through Friday. 
[02:51:30]  Very cool.  At the Grind Ballroom.  Yes.  Take us through tiggymaster.com.  Cool, man.  Real Bully 5150.  I get it.  Van Halen, or?  Are you a Van Halen fan?  Yeah.  Okay.

A U.S. company just launched a natural testosterone releasing formula.  It's called T-Release.  And unlike those testosterone boosters, T-Release works by freeing up more of the testosterone men already have. 
[02:54:00]  Jane, this breakthrough could benefit millions of men experiencing low libido, stamina, and energy.  Data shows that 98% of a man's testosterone winds up bound to other molecules, making it unavailable and inactive.  Using a patent-pending lozenge delivery system, T-Release obstructs this binding process to promote more free, active, and usable testosterone.  Reports show outstanding results.  This is such a huge breakthrough that T-Release has now set up a public phone line to distribute free 30-day trials. 
[02:54:30]  Supplies of these free trials are very limited.  So, for your free T-Release trial, call 800-894-9545 now.  That number again is 800-894-9545.  800-894-9545.

Dan Soder coming into the studio to join the show.  Hello.  Where's Dan going to be?  How you doing, man?  What's up, Dan?  Where are you?  I think you're over there.  I'm right here.  I'm right here.  Do you understand soccer? 
[03:01:00]  No, but I just love how everybody gets so riled up for the World Cup that I get into it,  and I become a xenophobe.  Do you?  You just look around, you're like, I hate those people.  I'm like, man, you're probably cheering for Spain on the train, just hating everybody.  I hope he's got a good point.  He says that people all of a sudden become fans just because it's kind of cool now to  say that you're into soccer.  Well, that's part of it.  I understand there's people that are definitely starting to really like soccer in America, 
[03:01:30]  but there's also those fake people like, oh, no, man, I love the World Cup.  I love soccer.  They have a Facebook posting about it.  I've lived in Williamsburg for about two years.  I'm going to get an artisan beer and go watch the World Cup football.  I call it football.  Football.  Fuck you.  Yeah, don't confuse you with American football.  I bet you would need violence.  You'd need violence to be a lieutenant.  Fuck you. 
[03:02:00]  Fuck you for knitting on the train.  Fuck you for blogging about people's feelings.  It's all tied to the same problem.  Yes, it is.  But we're the pompous assholes, though.  Because it should be called football.  Yeah.  Soccer should be called football.  This is not...  The NFL should not be called football.  Handball was taken.  These are one of those gifts you get when you have the best missiles.  Right.  We're going to call it football, and no one's going to do dick about it.  We can really blow a lot of shit up. 
[03:02:30]  Because in American football...  Yeah.  I mean, when you do use your foot, it's very rare.  It's very rare.  It's one to three points at best.  Yeah.  The kickoffs are who gives a fuck, right?  Now they've eliminated the kickoffs in the NFL.  The NFL is just perfect for...  What do you mean they eliminated the...  Well, they put them back to, like, they're kicking off from the 35 now, so almost every  kick is a touchback now.  Yeah.  Every kick in the NFL almost goes out of the end zone.  They don't want anyone running.  But I love American football, because I think it just sums us up as a country perfectly. 
[03:03:00]  No, this is football.  Fuck you.  It's like, we're going to have 10 seconds of pure chaotic violence, and then we're going  to sell you beer, and then 10 more seconds of pure chaotic violence, and we're going  to have you on your computer.  We want you to ignore your family.  We want you to do everything, and then...  Yeah, and then you could, you know, run around in a giant field, score every fucking 30 hours.  Yeah, it ends in a tie. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But I do love the World Cup, because I like the whole nation versus nation thing.  Can you be a deserter during a soccer game?  Yeah.  I think I can hang out over here, and no one's really going to know for a while.  Defect to another country or something?  Yeah, you'd be like, my dad's half Spanish.  I think I could be a fan of Spain.  Yeah, I could do both.  They're good.  No.  I'm into it.  I kind of like it.  If America's winning, I'm into it.  Once they lose, I'm like, ah, we don't need to lose.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  They did that against the China. 
[03:04:00]  Well, who's your second team?  You know, in sports, you kind of have that second team when yours is out of it.  I don't think I can hang out.  Yeah, you can't have a second team.  Who knows?  Like, you know, because we lived in Boston, I'll take a look at the Patriots a little bit  if my Jets aren't doing that great.  But who would you do for the World Cup?  The Bills, because I lived in Western New York for a while.  That's what I'm asking.  Do you have a second team?  You've got to go in, like, England or something.  Yeah.  You know, they're close to us.  We kind of came from them.  Yeah, I would have to go, like, Ireland. 
[03:04:30]  It's like when you leave, like, if you're a fucking, you know, you're a Pittsburgh fan.  Right.  Now you live in New York.  Right.  It's like England and the United States.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, well, I used to live over there.  Yeah, that's my point.  So, yeah.  Everyone kind of has that second team.  Although your second team can't be from the same city as your first team.  That's a weird thing.  I strongly believe that.  I like New Yorkers, though, because they always have that confidence.  They're like, what?  I'm a New Yorker.  I like the Jets and the Giants.  You can't.  I hate those people.  You can't do that.  Thank you. 
[03:05:00]  And then the Jets suck by week six, so all of a sudden everyone's like, no, I'm a Giants fan.  Right.  No, I don't do that.  No, Eli is the best thing ever, bro.  I'm an Islanders fan.  You know, that's rough.  Yeah, could you ever go to the Rangers?  No, I don't.  I've never rooted for the Rangers.  Do you root against them?  Yes, every time.  I wanted the Kings.  There you go.  I wanted the Kings.  That's good fandom.  That's a good hot fandom right there.  I can't remember a time that I actually ever rooted for the Rangers.  I can't think of it.  Damn.  1994.  All right, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  1994?  If they played Al-Qaeda, I think I would go with Al-Qaeda for the Rangers.  They got a guy from Long Island on Al-Qaeda.  He's pretty good.  I can't get forward.  Al-Qaeda for another Mohamed.  Mohamed passes to Mohamed.  Mohamed shoots him across the blue line.  Mohamed gets a Mohamed setting up with Mohamed.  Just go, Mohamed!  Mohamed Al-Shabaab passes to Mohamed Al-Shabaab.  That's not like a shitty horse race. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You think it's tough to pronounce the players' names.  Just get a few Muslims in the NHL.  Forget it.  Al-Shawiri.  Al-Shadar.  Al-Shadar.  Al-Shadar.  Oh, forget it.  Yeah, that's got to be...  Al-Hua-Huaq Bar!  What a shot!  Anyway.  So, soccer's going on.  That's good for a lot of people.  Yeah, but I guess...  And with U.S. winning, you know, you look like a dick if you're not kind of into it. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, you've got to be into it?  I guess...  Who do we play next?  Portugal?  Portugal.  Say, I know that.  The best of the...  The worst kind of soccer fans are the ones that are like, I watch it when it's North World Cup.  And you're like, oh, that's what no one gives a fuck.  No one gives a fuck.  That's like all those Olympic sports.  Yeah, that's like what I'd bring...  No one gives a fuck about any of those sports unless it's the Olympics.  I'm a curling...  I was just going to say that.  Are you going to the curling world championship?  Yeah.  Championship?  If you guys want, I've got four tickets to the luge prelims. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  No, I'm there.  I'm not even talking prelims of the Olympics.  I'm talking right now...  Out of season.  Right now they are luge-ing somewhere.  And no one gives a fuck.  At all.  Not for another four years.  They got a whole circuit.  Yeah.  I'm an amateur luger.  They didn't stop.  No one's watching.  They go from everyone watching to, all right, now we have to go to Hungary for a tournament.  Just the next guy that's taking the luge down.  He's the only one watching.  He's like the carny of the Olympic world.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  What do I do?  I smoke meth instead of luges.  Right.  I guess Delta Airlines got in some trouble.  What?  Because of the soccer match, right?  What?  I don't have the story in front of me.  Delta sent a little tweet out with a picture.  And it was a picture of the Statue of Liberty on one side with the number two superimposed over it.  The score, two.  And a picture of a giraffe.  Oh, boy.  And the number one superimposed over it.  Because here it is.  Because that's the score of Ghana. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  They apologized for that picture.  But it's...  And I have no idea why.  Oh, I thought it was just like a giraffe.  It's a beautiful picture.  And it's a beautiful picture of a giraffe out on the plains, though.  If they put a picture of some guy with a ring in his nose, stirring a buona in a pot, that might be misconstrued.  They apologized for that?  Yes, yes.  Why?  I have no idea. 
[03:08:30]  Don't you see that in Africa?  I would hope you do.  I would assume you would see a giraffe.  Is that their Statue of Liberty?  Well, what are they saying?  What's the problem?  What is the problem?  First of all, who had a problem?  Yeah.  You know who had a problem.  All the blog nation.  Liberal, white, guilty douchebags.  What did we do?  Did they show a picture of a hippo?  You know, that isn't very sensitive.  Oh, here it is.  We're sorry for our choice of photo in our precious tweet. 
[03:09:00]  Precious?  Shouldn't that say previous?  Yeah.  Whoops.  Best of luck to all teams playing in the...  And then the tweet ends.  Precious.  They put a picture of precious in it.  Precious up there.  Now that might need an apology.  You're like, Delta's really going in on this one.  They're like, fuck you.  Here's a picture of precious.  What do you want to do?  Huh?  You cocksuckers?  I like Delta goes Tupac and just goes all the way in.  Just fuck you.  Bones it.  Yeah.  That would be great.  It would be.  I'm a Sky Miles member and I would only fly Delta if that happened. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  What did that guy say?  Move up a little bit.  What seems to be the problem?  Delta, you're...  No, go down.  Smug one?  Yeah, yeah.  Delta, you are a really special kind of edicy, you know.  The incurable beating chest American kind.  That's South African for disgust.  Oh, sorry, South Africans.  Sorry we can't be as good as you guys. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, well, wow.  I love that South Africa's like, yeah, America.  Look how shit...  How about without Americans' stupid phony outrage,  they'd still be apartheid there, so shut up.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I, I, I ain't gonna play Sun City, you might remember.  This is why...  This fucking...  Everyone's opinion needs to be heard.  And it's...  Why would there be a need to apologize?  I still don't get what's offensive about that picture. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  What else does it say in that story?  Anything else in there?  It's just the tweets that came in.  Yeah.  E-Cow said, congratulations on being both smug, patronizing, and ignorant.  That's three things.  At the same time.  Why?  A giraffe on the plains.  Well, um, I'm getting, uh, I'm getting a report that there might not be giraffes in  Ghana.  In Ghana?  That might be the problem.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Michigan.  Kevin. 
[03:11:00]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hello.  How are you today?  Good.  Hey, that, uh, that article that they had in the paper this morning I read, they say  there are no giraffes in Ghana.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that could be a problem.  Yeah.  Well, in that case.  Do we know for sure?  It says right here, the long-necked animals do not live in Ghana.  Yeah.  That's even funnier.  Ah, who gives a shit?  It's in Africa.  That's even funny.  It's on the continent. 
[03:11:30]  I love stupid people.  Ah, I love the thought.  We didn't know either.  I would have just assumed there were giraffes there.  I guarantee.  I still think there are.  I think there are literally giraffes and lions running in every single country on the dark  continent.  Yeah.  If you're an African nation, I just assume.  I assume it's all over.  Giraffes and lions.  Everything looks like Doctari.  It would be like rhinos.  Right.  It would be like saying, congratulations, United States, and posting a bunch of Mounties.  Oh, because it's North America, it's just the continent of America, and that's it. 
[03:12:00]  But I wouldn't be insulted.  That's the whole thing.  I wouldn't care if someone made that mistake.  I would think it was fucking hilarious.  Funny as fuck.  I'd be like, oh yeah, you're calling us Canadians?  That's good.  Funny as fuck.  I wonder if Ghanese...  If I was Delta, I would just tweet, boy, we're stupid.  I'd have to apologize.  I bet there's giraffes in Ghana.  I bet there are.  You think one's...  There's no giraffes in Ghana. 
[03:12:30]  Why?  They're connected.  It's Africa.  And there's giraffes in...  Giraffes don't know there's borders.  They could walk right into Ghana and go, see, now I'm in Ghana.  There's giraffes in New York City.  There you go.  Central Park Zoo.  That's the zoo.  This is good logic.  I like that.  A giraffe could walk right into Ghana with nary a problem.  Yeah, I think...  I don't know if the Central Park Zoo...  That doesn't matter.  Do anyone in Ghana have a problem with this?  They do at the Bronx Zoo.  I bet the Ghana...  I saw some of the fans from Ghana.  They don't have a problem with anything. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  They looked...  And I said it before.  Like, you ever see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom?  Yes.  Call him Ma...  That guy?  Come here!  That's exactly it.  Oh, man.  That's fucking great.  I bet they have him as...  Ha ha!  Dr. Jones!  That guy is crazy.  I bet you they have him as pets, even.  Yeah, they probably do.  I don't understand why you tweet out a picture of a giraffe.  We do not have them.  Delta, I want you to apologize.  No. 
[03:13:30]  You're on Twitter?  No.  I follow Delta.  A direct message there.  We just...  We don't even fly there.  We don't know what's running around your country.  That's their African hub.  Yeah.  Well, I guess it's like if you take an animal that's indigenous to maybe the...  Like an armadillo, right?  Yeah.  And you congratulate, like, New York.  Let's say the Yankees wanted something.  And you're like, yay!  And there's an armadillo. 
[03:14:00]  You'd be like, there's no armadillos.  But an armadillo could walk its way right into New York.  But would you care?  Would you want an apology?  I don't give a shit.  All right.  That's the difference.  The armadillo would take so long to walk all the way to New York.  Why?  What's the spirit of a walking armadillo?  And what if it starts hitchhiking?  Yeah.  Exactly.  What if it's on a zany adventure?  I feel like New Yorkers would demand an apology.  That's the one city where they'd be like, you don't mess this up.  Ain't no fucking armadillo in New York, you cocksucker.  Right.  Exactly. 
[03:14:30]  I know it.  Our third generation.  No armadillos.  Yeah.  I never seen one.  Been here my whole fucking life.  You wanted to do more apologies?  Yeah.  There's four more.  Do you know what we're doing on our show?  We're trying to go ten days without an apology.  We don't even go a day.  Good luck.  We don't even go a day.  Oh, without someone apologizing?  Yeah.  For something stupid.  Like, every once in a while, people will tweet you, you know, they probably should apologize  for that one.  Yeah.  There's some that have come out, I guess, maybe. 
[03:15:00]  I don't know.  But in general, these apologies are all just complete bullshit.  It's the point we're trying to make with our cute little radio bitch.  No, but it's so fucking weird that we're just a culture of, like, we say the most vicious  shit online.  Yeah, yeah.  People have more contact than the ability to just say fucked up shit to someone directly  via Twitter.  Yeah.  And yet, on the other side of that is everyone's apologizing.  Uh-huh.  Except the people that talk shit on Twitter. 
[03:15:30]  Except them.  Except you.  I don't know if it's actually our culture.  It's a small minority of people.  Do you think it's all marketing money?  Like, people just don't want to win money?  Because most of us, I'm sure, don't want an apology, don't need an apology for some of  this dumb shit that some of these companies are doing or saying.  Most of us.  It's some weird, like, small minority that has some kind of power in our country right  now.  I've never wanted an apology because of things people have said on Twitter.  Do you need to see an apology from Delta because of their giraffe picture? 
[03:16:00]  No.  I won't fly with them until they do, Opie.  As someone who studies the animal culture of Africa.  Well, JetBlue apologizes.  Remember the story about the toddler?  Uh-huh.  Forced to urinate in her seat because of a flight attendant.  Hmm.  Where are you at with flight attendants?  You travel a lot.  I think they're all twats, just so I can start the discussion.  I look at them like, um, they're like food court workers in the sky. 
[03:16:30]  So I can't, like, they used to be waitresses and now they're like, you know, they're just  like, yes, do you want a soda?  My kids don't love me.  Right.  And you're like, I'm sorry, Pam.  She's like, we got you to Atlanta.  Everyone's alive.  I can go back to hating my life.  They know it's a shitty job.  I got a 24-hour turnaround.  They thought it would be cool because they'd get to see the world, but the fact is they  see the world's airports.  Yeah, you get to see a Marriott outside of Fort Worth every fucking two weeks. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  I remember, I think it was a flight to Vegas, and it just blew my mind.  I'm like, where the flight crew is from New York.  Yeah.  We're flying from New York.  They fly to Vegas, and I'm like, now what?  I actually had a conversation.  I'm like, well, now we fly home.  Yeah, you're right.  And they're like, and I will have dinner with my family tonight in New York.  I'm like, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  The greats, when they go on a sky tour, where I'm like, where are you heading after this? 
[03:17:30]  They're like, well, we're going to hub in Denver, then we're going to go to Seattle.  And then it's my son Jacob's birthday, but I'll be in Toronto.  No, I'm talking about the ones that just go back and forth all day.  Oh, the one location.  And then they're actually driving back home to their house, even though they've been in a  couple cities that day.  Yeah, they've been in two different time zones.  It's so fucked up to me.  There's got to be something that fucks with your brain.  Yeah, your DNA.  Yeah.  Just come back all warped. 
[03:18:00]  Because most of us, if we fly, we're going to be there for a little while.  I need a nap.  Not that, man.  If I'm on an hour flight, I'm like, I've got to sleep that way.  Right.  Can I sleep?  Anyway, Joe Blue apologizes.  He apologized to a mother who said her child had to urinate in her airplane seat because  the flight attendant would not let her use the restroom while the plane sat on the tarmac  at a New York airport.  It wasn't even moving.  All right.  Here's the...  Our team reached out.  We love reading the actual apology because it's all bullshit.  Our team reached out directly to the customer today to offer an apology for her experience. 
[03:18:30]  The crew made a safety and an FAA regulation-based decision.  Oh, blame it on the FAA.  All right.  Smart.  Gotcha.  I think they should attack the toddler.  You're a dirty girl.  Well, if she wants to piss all over herself.  I don't have a problem.  Maybe you should.  We're sorry you're raising a fucking zoo animal.  Yeah.  Next time, keep old Hummingbird bladder at home. 
[03:19:00]  We're going to have these problems.  You want to take to the majestic skies?  With a thing with a bladder the size of a dime?  Well, I just...  Diaper.  Look into it.  Well, they gave the family some stuff.  Did they?  Free peanuts?  This is even more insulting than what they just did.  Yeah?  In addition to the apology, JetBlue gave the family a $50 credit toward a future plane.  Oh, sorry, little habit I picked up from watching the Queen's show. 
[03:19:30]  $50 toward a future flight.  Would your kid piss himself?  It's $50.  $50.  At least the flight won't be long enough for her to piss herself.  $50.  Where's that getting you?  It's a bus ticket.  Yeah.  And this is an offer to give $5,000 to her favorite charity.  Oh, a toddler's favorite charity?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  This money will be going to the Catch the Boogeyman Foundation. 
[03:20:00]  Very important charity in this girl's life.  Um, the Santa fund.  Yeah, she had to.  It was a big decision between that and, of course, the dreaded cooties.  We're trying to cure cooties in our lifetime.  What the fuck?  A statement from the toddler read,  The lady on the fly-fly made me make a boom-boom in my pants. 
[03:20:30]  Official word coming from the toddler camp.  Holy fuck.  What a fucking...  That's insulting.  Our third apology today.  Could be the best.  I probably should have saved this for last, but fuck it.  Because maybe people will get bored in two now,  and then they're going to miss this really good one.  Yeah.  KFC.  Oh, I like this one, too.  KFC paying medical bills for a Mississippi girl  who was asked to leave because...  Oh, the poor girl.  It's horrible. 
[03:21:00]  Because her facial injuries scared dinosaurs.  Oh, man.  She's adorable.  I think she's adorable.  She's a little cut up around her mouth.  Remember?  I hope those scars go away.  Remember...  Poor kid.  I just said only a mere few minutes ago  that we're not unreasonable.  Right.  I think maybe KFC should apologize.  For making...  I don't know.  For giving a little girl Phantom of the Opera complex?  I know.  She's got a little eye patch on,  and her mouth is a little...  I'd love to see the manager approach. 
[03:21:30]  Excuse me, sir.  Can you take that little monster out of my restaurant?  You'd have to fight.  Yeah.  You're making my daughter leave.  Something tells me it sounded more like,  that child can't stay in here.  She's scaring all the customers.  You brought the devil baby in here.  I am not going to sit here and watch that child.  The man wants your baby to leave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another one.  Yeah.  Some woman that looks like Jesse Orozco telling you to fucking take your kid out of here. 
[03:22:00]  Fuck that.  You made it.  Let's read a little bit of this.  KFC, excuse me, says it's investigating allegations that a restaurant employee...  You might be right, Ed.  An employee in Jackson, Mississippi.  Jackson, Mississippi.  Jackson, Mississippi.  Asked a three-year-old to leave because her facial injuries disturbed other patrons.  As you're eating stupid chicken?  She said the child's face was whack.  And creepy as hell.  So, KFC giving $30,000 toward the little girl's medical bills. 
[03:22:30]  To a charity of hers.  Charity of hers.  Which is the kill every doggie on earth charity.  The old glass eye fund.  Oh, no.  Does she have a glass eye?  I don't know.  That is so sad.  She's adorable.  She is so cute.  What's wrong with her?  The allegations about KFC was made Thursday on Victoria's Victories.  A Facebook page following Victoria's recovery from a pit bull attack in April. 
[03:23:00]  Oh!  Pit bull.  Oh, my God.  She was bit by a dog?  Fuck!  That's crazy.  I mean...  Poor kid.  You know what?  KFC, I think you really fucked up on this one.  You really fucked up?  You took a little angel that was attacked by a monster.  Yes.  You know, pit bulls are friendly by nature.  It's mostly evil.  And I don't appreciate that you say they're all evil.  I don't have a bad reputation as being vicious, but it's just how you're raised. 
[03:23:30]  It really lies with the owner.  They're one of the most lovable dogs ever.  Shut it!  They get a call, though.  Every time we say that.  Every attack!  They're dialing right now.  Who raised the dog?  You know, they're known to be the most lovable.  I, myself, leave my children alone with our pit bull.  You should say my pit bull with my two-year-old.  It's always...  They've had that, with my two-year-old, never had a problem.  The most vicious animals on the face of the earth.  They're the velociraptor of this millennium. 
[03:24:00]  Fucking land alligators.  Yes, land alligators.  Fucking walking around, fucking death rolling on little girls' faces.  What's their bite equivalent to?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Their bite grip's equivalent to, like, fucking...  It's like those things that drive pilings in.  That's what their fucking jaws can...  That's a fucking myth-busters fact.  Man, I got more pressure here.  Say the phones.  My pit bull loves babies! 
[03:24:30]  Yes!  The administration posted a photo showing Victoria smiling shyly in spite of facial scars and cartoon-decorated eye patch writing.  Does this look scary to you?  That's so sad.  Last week at KFC in Jackson, Mississippi, this precious face was asked to leave because her face scared the other diners.  I'd love to see the guy that complained.  Oh, right?  Um, excuse me, miss.  When I finish off my half-bucket original recipe, I notice that monster of a little girl staring at me while I'm trying to eat my potato wedges. 
[03:25:00]  And, uh, can you ask her to leave?  Because if a dog bit her face, it means Jesus doesn't love her.  God's forsaken that little girl, and I don't want to be reminded of it as I eat my bowl of mush.  Yes, I eat my deep-fried mush bowl.  Excuse me.  Hey.  He goes up to the county. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, boy.  I don't like this girl here.  He's breathing through his teeth.  He goes, excuse me.  Look, boy.  At first, I just thought it was some of that tasty gravy you put on your taters.  Then I noticed her mama wiped her face and it didn't wipe off.  You tell me, son.  If I can't trust a little girl to be around a pit bull, I can't trust to eat around her neither. 
[03:26:00]  It was obviously her fault. She was enticing the dog.  Much like them chargers they pinned on me a few years back with her sweet kissable face.  What?  Oh, it's just the wrongest thing you can do to this poor kid.  This little girl's an angel.  She really is an angel.  We got the apology.  You know, that's the one apology where you're kind of like, I don't know.  Like I said, if anything merits an apology, this is one. 
[03:26:30]  I do want to acknowledge because they've hit us up on Twitter.  This is a good one.  At times, it's probably okay to apologize.  No giraffes, you got it?  I could give a shit.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You made a little girl leave a place of eating because her face was badly beaten.  I do not understand you.  The guy is just blown away by our apologies.  We are the same thing from clitoral removal scars.  I cannot eat if I see a little girl with her clit. 
[03:27:00]  I get very upset.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, man.  It's just awful.  The balls it takes, you're at a lousy KFC.  Yeah.  You've got to make them take a little girl out there.  You need your borders, bro.  It's Dica.  Look, I like KFC every once in a while, but I kind of am aware that I'm in a shithole. 
[03:27:30]  That's why I wear fucking basketball shorts.  I fully expect to see some strange things in a KFC, okay?  I don't walk in in a fucking suit coat.  Right.  Hmm.  Excuse me, I made reservations for seven here.  It's for soda.  It's, uh, yeah, reservations.  I can't see.  For soda.  Yes, the soda party is here. 
[03:28:00]  Do you have a table by the window?  You know what?  We'll go to the counter and wait until you get our table ready.  We'll be sitting in the non-scarred children's section.  Do you have an available table there?  Excuse me, do you have anything away from that three-year-old monster?  How am I supposed to lick my fingers?  Basically, you've got people talking to themselves in KFC.  She's probably the last thing in that restaurant.  With a little girl that's going through a situation. 
[03:28:30]  I've been in multiple KFCs where fecal matter has been smeared on the walls.  There you go.  You can't use a bathroom.  Every fucking KFC bathroom looks like an asylum holding cell from the 20s.  It's just fucking blood and shit.  With that said, here's the apology.  They're always wonderful.  As soon as we were notified to young Harvey Dent.  We wish her good luck in fighting the Batman. 
[03:29:00]  I feel so bad.  She's so cute.  As soon as we were notified of this report on Friday, we immediately began an investigation.  Ah, investigation.  As this kind of hurtful and disrespectful action would not be tolerated by KFC.  Pardon me, did you have the original recipe chicken or was it the, uh...  It's just one thing.  Columbo, busting it up?  Yes, an investigation at KFC.  I'm sure it was very thorough.  Hello.  My name is Don Falco. 
[03:29:30]  I'm KFC detective.  I'd like to give you this eye.  You could maybe pop that behind your little cartoon patch.  Regardless of the outcome of our investigation, we have apologized to Victoria's family and are committed to assisting them.  The company is making a $30,000 donation to assist with her medical bills.  The entire KFC family is behind Victoria.  I don't think the entire KFC family...  The KFC family is one person. 
[03:30:00]  You gotta give that little monster money.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I couldn't get a raise out of this motherfucking...  And not give a little monster trail money.  Turns out I gotta grab my baby, get bit by a punt ball.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I'm gonna have my baby get bit by a punt ball and get kicked out of my hands, too.  That child walk in, I start yelling, world star, world star!  Her grandmother, Kelly Mullen, said Victoria had just been to a doctor's when they stopped at the restaurant. 
[03:30:30]  She ordered mashed potatoes for Victoria because she thought the hungry child could swallow the soft food without chewing.  Oh, no!  Fucking animals at KFC.  God damn it.  She says she was then approached by an employee.  They just told us, they said, we have to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers.  Oh, my God.  From eating our non-chicken chicken.  Yes.  Wow. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, it's not like she's fucking like Richard from Boardwalk Empire.  Fucking...  If I take my mask off while I eat...  Please don't look at me while I eat.  Jesus.  She doesn't look bad at all.  Not at all.  She looks adorable.  She got fucked up by the pit bull, but she looks like she's going to be doing well.  Why do you have to say by the pit bull?  Just say a dog, because we all know that pitties are the most lovable.  Pity.  Pity.  Pity.  My pity.  I have my pity.  Stop perpetuating pit bull culture. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  You're just letting this be a pit bull culture.  Yes.  You just don't understand, because the news just reports on the massive amounts of killing that these dogs do.  Efficiently.  The efficient...  Efficiently.  Right.  They're eating machines.  It's their fucking steam shovel job.  The fact that they could just pick an eye out of a child like it's a grape.  They would eat your car if you didn't leave them food. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, my God.  These iron-chomping machines.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Her picture's bumming me out, because she's such a little cute...  You know.  Anyway, let's see.  She's adorable.  Yes.  All right.  Disrupting our customers.  Victoria wept all the way home, and now is embarrassed by her appearance, something that wasn't the case before.  Oh.  Victoria was attacked by pit bulls at her grandfather's home.  Oh.  The dogs broke her nose, both jaws, cheekbone. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  This is how hard they bite.  They broke...  All right.  Ready?  The dogs broke her nose, both jaws, cheekbones, and right eye socket.  The right side of her face is paralyzed.  Oh.  And she lost that eye, according to her Facebook site.  Why didn't she just say Harvey M?  Did you tell me Charlie M, you fucking...  You made me pop your eye out of your socket for that prick?  Oh, no.  I said Harvey M. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  The poor kid.  She got casinoed.  Yes.  Oh.  More.  Oh, no.  There's more problems.  Her bottom jaw was reconstructed, but she needs a feeding tube and must grow more bone in her face before more surgery is possible.  Oh, my God.  Someone asked them to leave.  Get your good pity.  Get your good pity.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  Leave.  I don't feel comfortable with your daughter eating on mashed taters looking at my daughter. 
[03:33:30]  My daughter got teeth, and I just taught her how to use them.  Please make your little monster leave.  Oh, the poor kid.  We don't serve kindly to one-eyed freaks walking in here.  She's got a beautiful blue eye.  Poor kid.  She'll really be leaning on that eye.  Oh, man.  I hope they can fix her up.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  That dog was fucking latched onto her face like a monster.  But it's not the dog's fault.  Do you blame the gun or the person aiming it?  You blame the person aiming it.  You know.  What's her grandfather hiding?  What are we not learning about her grandfathers?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are the living conditions of these dogs?  They're very sensitive.  The dog was only responding to something that it perceived as a threat.  An adorable little girl.  A harmless little cute girl. 
[03:34:30]  And perceived it as a threat.  And by the sixth death shake, I think she knew that it wasn't a threat.  By the time it wrung out all life in her eyes.  Oh, God.  Here we get one of these guys, though.  You know, Anthony, spend an hour with my pit bull.  You change your ways.  You change your tune.  I'm going to bring one into the studio.  Yeah, you can just fucking shit out and pet it. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, really?  I'm going to close my, why don't you spend an afternoon with one?  The way you guys say it makes you sound bad.  But pit bull's a good dog.  I've never seen a pit bull just being gently walked.  The child made an aggressive move.  It must have done something like scratched its ear.  Or maybe smiled and showed those baby teeth.  Then it would soon knock right out of her head. 
[03:35:30]  Jesus.  You see pit bulls in New York, and it's always on some heavy-duty chain.  It's a six-inch long chain.  The guy is just in control, but barely.  One distraction and all hell's going to break loose.  And it just wants to go forward.  The fucking Resident Evil dogs are nicer.  Fucking, you've got to be kidding me.  Yeah, every guy holding it just looks terrifying. 
[03:36:00]  More terrifying than the dog.  What's your number one dog dog?  Everyone has their number one dog they're scared of.  For me, it's German Shepherds, because I was bit pretty bad on a paper route.  So to this day, German Shepherds scare me way more than pit bulls.  Rottweilers.  Rottweilers.  Rotties used to be the big, like, go-to death dogs.  Yeah, in the killing babies' field, pit bulls overtook them.  Yeah, pit bulls just took everybody.  Rottweilers are pretty intense.  Rottweilers are the scariest.  Yorkshire Terriers, for me.  They're just horrifying. 
[03:36:30]  Little tiffy toodles my sister had.  Used to hide in the bathtub during thunderstorms.  And just, if you looked at it, we'd go...  I fucking hate those dogs.  You should have filled up the bathtub.  Oh, I did.  I'd turn the shower, and I'd go, fuck you.  That thing would go...  It does that bite fucking thing on your hand.  I'd laugh my ass off.  It's like seven bites in one. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Rapid fire.  We gotta go to rain in Cleveland.  Ray, go ahead.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Quickly, sir.  We're on a good roll here.  I had a...  I date a girl whose mom's boyfriend rescued these two pit bulls, and these...  This fucking guy had to spend time feeding them tranquilizers to keep them in check.  Ha, ha, ha.  You gotta medicate the dog.  And one night they actually fought. 
[03:37:30]  And I've never seen such brutality in my life watching two skinny guys fight over a fucking  piece of cheese.  Wow.  It's sad.  Thank you.  Thank you for saying what needed to be said.  This goes unreported.  This is...  No, no, no.  The rescue pet needs to be loved and taken care of very early on.  I have a dog therapist that you need to take your dog to, to really get out of those problems. 
[03:38:00]  People are so...  They're just misunderstood.  Maybe babies should have...  Stop having such squishable faces.  Maybe if these kids weren't walking around with such biteable little faces.  Fucking...  Fucking...  Fucking monsters at KFC.  Maybe the child could have eaten something that the dog smelled and took as prey.  Was the dog around any food?  Was the baby around food? 
[03:38:30]  Maybe the baby...  If the baby ate something that smelled like the natural prey...  Which is anything.  Which is pretty much anything from a mouse to a buit.  To a buit.  Right, right.  Maybe it smelled metal.  And it just wanted to chew through its face.  Maybe the dog was saying hi.  Very aggressive.  It was giving kisses. 
[03:39:00]  Little toothy kisses.  Holy fuck.  Orbital bone crushing kisses.  Bone crushing.  Face paralyzing kisses.  They are monsters.  They're fucking...  That walk the earth.  Hell house.  The pit bull owner is going to hate us today.  Oh, you have to apologize to the pit bull owner.  Open after the show.  Right. 
[03:39:30]  Seriously.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Apologize.  Our ignorance of dogs drove us to a comedy bitch.  I think we got a New York City cop on the line.  All right.  Greg.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Dude, I just got a quick story.  Back in the years ago, we encountered a pit bull in the hallway, and it came at us, and my  partner shot it twice, hit it directly in the head, and I swear, guys, the dog just went 
[03:40:00]  and looked at us like, what else you got?  You know, just like humans on PCP.  Yes, of course.  Fucking shook off a gunshot.  We got natural PSP going through their fucking bluffs.  Their fucking head.  It's like trying to knock out a bowling ball.  It's fucking...  That head of theirs is prehistoric.  Strip down the flesh off of a pit bull head, and I defy you to tell the difference between 
[03:40:30]  that and a T-Rex.  So, what did you guys end up doing after that?  We actually shot it in the torso, and it went down, but it actually lived.  Jesus.  Wow.  Fuck.  It was crazy.  They don't fucking think.  Fuck around, man.  Yeah.  Now walks around the neighborhood showing its scars.  Yeah, I was shot, motherfucker.  Every pit bull's built like Rambo.  They all are fucking...  No, you don't understand.  That baby drew first blood. 
[03:41:00]  It ain't my fault.  It's their fault.  They're all dead.  All the other pit bulls are dead.  What you've just unleashed in your backyard is a killing machine.  I didn't start this.  They started it.  They're all gone, Bobo.  That's his name and other pit bulls.  You send those babies in.  You better order one thing.  I'll large supply of diapers and eye patches.  Have a great day, guys.  Thank you.  All right. 
[03:41:30]  Bullet to the head, and it bounced the fuck off.  I said, what else you got?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Can you imagine that?  That would be scary.  He was looking at your partner like, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  Fuck, that's crazy.  People want to know if it was a regular KFC or one of those KFC Taco Bell combo.  Oh, a taco hut?  That's the big difference there.  KFC wasn't going to say anything, but the Taco Bell got involved.  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  I love those combo places.  It's a little confusing, though.  I don't know.  You don't know what you should get.  You're confused.  You never get some of one and some of the other, though, do you?  As a pothead, I think it's the greatest thing ever.  I wouldn't doubt it.  A personal pan pizza and a burrito and throw in some fucking chicken tenders.  You go for the...  You know what?  It's the greatest.  You got a good turn to that.  Yeah, it is amazing.  All right.  Well, KFC sucks. 
[03:42:30]  A very...  A big one.  A legitimate apology.  Right.  That's a real...  Yeah, I can't fucking...  A whole bunch of slobs in KFC looking at her as the problem.  Sweet girl.  Can you...  Can you make that go, Dave?  Yes!  Why?  I'm uncomfortable.  Grotesque people.  Sir, excuse me.  You have gravy in between two of your fat rolls.  Oh, thank you.  I was saving that.  Make that little girl leave. 
[03:43:00]  Aw.  Poor kid.  We have two more apologies.  Oh, okay.  But we can wait for after the break.  That's a big one.  Is that...  We want that one to sit there for a while.  That's...  I should digest that one for a while.  Yeah.  There's no way...  KFC, you know...  We're not monsters on this show.  They should have apologized on that one.  Yes.  But not everything...  But see, the problem is with everyone apologizing.  When there's one that is legit, it just...  It seems like nonsense.  It gets swept under...  You forget about it.  Right.  That's why you got to stop with the silly apology. 
[03:43:30]  So when someone does apology, you can go, oh, wow, okay.  No one apologized to the dog for just being a dog.  It's just doing what it knows.  I think you guys should apologize to pit bulls, pit bull owners, and KFC, people who take  their pit bulls to KFC.  It was just projecting itself from the soft, velvety, smooth cheeks of a child.  Maybe the toddler said the trigger word of doggy. 
[03:44:00]  That's a trigger word.  A trigger word.  The trigger word.  I think as far as innocence goes, there's nothing more innocent...  Than a blonde, blue-eyed, perfect little Aryan baby.  That did nothing wrong to deserve this.  Maybe a kitten is more innocent than her.  That's about it.  There's nothing more adorable than that little girl.  That's it.  Yeah.  It starts with her.  Yeah.  Don't go anywhere.  We'll be right back with more of the Best of the Week from the Opie and Anthony Show.

[03:45:00]  A public smoking announcement from new Zoom e-cigs.  We are here to spread the word about overcrowded smoking prisons.  In airports across the land, smokers are unjustly detained in glass cages filled with eye-watering  smoke on display for all to see.  We say no more time in the smokey-pokey.  With Zoom e-cigs, there's no smoke, no smell, just flavor so bold you won't believe it's  an e-cig.  Together, we can free our flavor.  Flavor beats fire at ZoomEcigs.com. 
[03:45:30]  Truckers, you're expected to go the distance every day.  And you should expect the same from your engine oil.  That's why Shell is now offering the Shell Rotella lubrication limited warranty for heavy-duty  diesel engines.  Covering up to 10 years, 500,000 miles.  This is protection that goes the distance.

[03:46:00]  I'm Victor Khaleesi, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities.  And I'm Bill Bratton, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department.  MOPD works to assure that people with disabilities can enjoy the rich opportunities  our city has to offer.  This includes the freedom to travel throughout New York City, a right most of us take for  granted.  For people with disabilities, traveling around the city can become a challenge when drivers  fail to follow basic parking rules.  New York City's parking regulations protect the rights of people with disabilities.  When you violate parking regulations, you not only violate the law, you violate the rights 
[03:46:30]  of others.  Parking spaces designated for people with disabilities ensure equal access to goods and services.  Parking without a permit in a designated space or using a fake permit is illegal.  Any car parked illegally in a space designated for a person with disabilities will be ticketed  and subject to tow.  The fine is $180.  So do the right thing and save yourself money and hassle.  Respect the right of every New Yorker to accessible transportation.

Hold on.  Let me take my jacket off.  It's getting warm in here from inside.  No.  That was a forest fire from far away.  That sounds like paper crinkling. 
[03:50:00]  Did you want to.  You don't use the props for your Foley work.  This is fire.  No.  That's an up close fireplace.  You said fire.  That's a fireplace.  What was your fire?  My fire was if you're in the woods.  Okay.  Trapped in a fire storm.  Yes.  How far from the fire am I?  You're around like.  On mine?  You're around like a mile.  A mile.  Is it cold out?  It's cold out on mine.  Stars out?  Stars were out.  Moon was clear.  Yeah.  And the animals around?  Animals.  Oh, this horse isn't here again. 
[03:50:30]  I could have closed my eyes and thought they were real.  Now I got the picture painted in my head.  Now I'm through your fire.  Oh, boy.  It's getting hot in here.  There's a forest fire a mile away.  I'll say there is.  I'm feeling all the heat now.  This leaf is burning.  The best part, Bobby's trying to sell it.  What does it sound like when the fire truck is coming?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[03:51:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Are they fighting the fire from above, Bobby?  Shh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  A big heartbeat.  Damn, that's a helicopter.  I'm in a fucking helicopter.  That's Bobby in five minutes on the treadmill.  That's your heart test.  That's what the technician's going to hear.  Should we?  He's going to have to take his headphones off.  We should just do improv Foley work tomorrow.  All right, Bobby.  But we're going to do Foley, too.

What about milk being poured into a glass?  That's right.  A poured into a...  Sounds like a phone.  Exactly.  That was terrible.  No, it's actually... 
[03:52:00]  Oh, cool.  That's also a piggy drinking.  You're spilling water all over yourself.  You're really into this Foley work.  Can I just say something, though?  You know, somebody was listening and went,  well, that was fucking a good one.  Because there's actually liquid being poured into a glass.  All right, I need a napkin.  This is called...  Well, give me another one.  Go ahead.  Throw them at me.  I'm a fucking...  Dude, I want...  You understand...  A steak.  A steak.  You know the Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first three movies,  I did the Foley work.  Who's Arnold Schwarzenegger?  How about Arnold? 
[03:52:30]  No, it's Arnold.  How about a distant bear?  A distant bear?  Distant, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A distant bear.  That was very good. 
[03:53:00]  That was a distant bear.  I can do any...  The sounds of ice skating.  The sounds of...  Oh.  Whish.  Whish.  Whish.  You guys can't see it, but Bob's moving his feet under the console.  Yeah.  That's what Fo...  Dude, that's...  How about...  Foley people, you have to...  No, I know.  You're in the moment.  You have to use what's around you.  What about a babbling brook?  A babbling brook?  Brook.  Wow.  Waterfall.

So, uh, did you have a good time?  Yes, Naples, Florida was amazing.  Oh.  What makes Naples, oh, Naples, Florida.  Naples.  You were a little scared that we were gonna find out that you went to Italy, I guess, huh?  No, I wasn't scared.  I just wasn't telling you this time.  Why?  Well, let's see.  I'm sure there's plenty of best of segments where you've called me at various vacations or at home. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, but it's now a bit.  Yeah.  We're concerned about it.  It's now a bit.  We gotta continue the bit.  No, you don't have to continue the bit.  And it's a lot harder.  Are you sure?  Or, you know, go overseas.  We missed you by one day at one of the hotels.  Right.  I was moving around a lot.  Yeah.  I had to move around a lot.  Didn't the guy at the hotel go, oh, he left yesterday.  Yes, Mr. Naples, he left yesterday.  We're like, fuck.  We almost had you. 
[04:04:30]  Ah, shit.  What'd you see?  Where'd you go?  I went to six different cities, which was fun.  Did you really?  Yeah.  In six days?  Seven days?  Yep.  Wow.  Damn.  What were the cities?  Well, the big ones being Rome and Florence.  Right.  Went to a city called Assisi.  Assisi.  Like St. Anthony Assisi?  Probably.  Right.  That's usually where it all comes from, anyway.  Ah, one of those.  Okay. 
[04:05:00]  Um, uh, Siena.  Francis Assisi, whatever.  Siena.  Siena, which was very nice.  Right.  Uh, this one is hard to pronounce.  Uh-oh.  Diane.  San, uh, Jimmy, San Jimmy.  Sandwich?  Yeah.  Let's go with sandwich.  Uh, sandwich, San Jimmy, G-I-M-I-G-N-A-N-O.  San Giamano?  Giamano.  Oh, wow.  How many days in each city?  One day?  Um, some cities were, uh, two days.  Uh, no, it was two cities in one day.  A couple days in another city.  Were you flying or taking a train? 
[04:05:30]  Driving.  Oh, you rented a car.  Drive.  Is that the other side of the road?  Is that the other side of the road place?  Nope.  Italy is pretty much America.  Mamma mia.  Italy is pretty much America.  Yep.  Signs are the same.  Uh, gas stations right off the highway are all the same.  Yeah.  Wherever you're going, you can figure it out.  Double signs?  You don't know the language.  Double signs on the road?  Italian and American?  Nope.  Or English or whatever?  All Italian.  Unless you're in, uh, some of the major cities.  It's all Italian.  Yeah.  But you could figure out that kilometer stuff.  Yeah, I guess.  No, I couldn't.  We're not going to be speeding. 
[04:06:00]  They have the dashboard reversed for the ones that aren't digital.  The kilometers are on the top in the big numbers.  Oh, I see.  You got to kind of look, uh, oh boy.  Oh boy.  Well, that sounds fun.  Yeah, it's great.  And of course, uh, what is the food like there?  Um, obviously, pasta is amazing.  But just like, uh, any place that you go, you have to know or find out what the good restaurants  are compared to.  Because there's good ones and bad ones.  Well, they have a lot of rows that look like Little Italy, where they're all just standing  outside, holding a menu, trying to bring you into the restaurant, and you don't go to  those ones.  Oh, okay. 
[04:06:30]  You find some of the nicer ones.  What makes, uh, their spaghetti so, or their pasta so much better?  They make it all in the restaurant.  Like, you can see it.  So why can't we do that here?  New York, you can't find good Italian food.  How's the Italian food in this place?  I had Italian food the other night.  I've never been to this place.  It's hard.  I mean, you go down to Little Italy, of course.  No, this is on the Upper East Side.  Yeah, but the rest of Manhattan, it's really tough to get just a solid plate of pasta.  It's delightful.  It was good, huh?  Yeah, someone told me, I don't normally get a good Italian food.  Yeah.  I'd like to meet her, Rupert. 
[04:07:00]  Anyway.  You can have all the food laid out.  You pick your meat.  You pick your, uh, your seafood, your shellfish.  You can see them making the pasta.  Your shellfish.  Yeah.  And, uh, no consumer reviews, uh, no consumer reviews about the Italian food.  There'll be some.  Okay.  Not only the ones that Americans are interested in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to go international with the consumer?  The consumer international.  International.  So no problems? 
[04:07:30]  Everything went smooth?  No, everything was great.  That's fucking cool.  Just you and your wife, right?  And, uh, family.  Oh, you did family.  A bunch of family went, too.  Oh, okay.  The whole Nagel clan.  I would have taken today and tomorrow off, though.  Yeah.  And really extend your vacation.  Yeah.  Didn't want to do that.  See, see.  Why?  Because I didn't want to use all the days.  It'll be one more day, right?  Yeah, but then I'm still here tomorrow.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So.  That would have been a great little movie.  The Nagels go to Italy or something.  Sure.  Yeah.  The Nagels go to Italy. 
[04:08:00]  Do what airline?  United.  Were they okay?  It was, uh, on the way, way back, the staff just sucked, but the flight itself wasn't bad.  Right.  Yeah, they're not happy people.  No, especially when they're...  The United staff sucks.  Wow.  It's been my experience.  The, uh, the Russian lady...  I fucking hate United still, by the way.  Damn.  Not over it.  How about you acknowledge that I, I, I, I put in a complaint, at least.  Oh, boy.  You know how many people put in complaints?  They don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't.  Kenny?  They don't care.  Oh, here comes Kenny. 
[04:08:30]  Have they acknowledged our complaint yet?  Kenny.  Yes, I did get the response yesterday.  Oh.  Yesterday, of all days, then?  Yes.  The lost luggage is going to be a training issue.  But it's a plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Training issue.  What does that mean?  What?  They're going to have, you know, teach their staff to be more empathetic.  That's good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Most of the staff cannot pronounce empathetic that handles the luggage. 
[04:09:00]  And they put in a request to refund the airfare because he got bumped from first to coach because of the change of plane.  So they put in a request.  Oh, the request is going to come.  Well, he's never done this before.  He's going to put in a request.  You're a fucking liar.  And they reminded me that you got a $250 travel voucher, and that will be all the compensation. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, shit.  That's it, motherfucker.  That's all they give you for...  They're just a shit.  I don't even know where that is anymore.  Well, that's what I'm going to tell you.  I lost it in the luggage.  Uh-oh.  I really did.  They lose your luggage and knock you out of first and give you $250.  What a shit airline.  Righteous.  But it wasn't about...  Whatever.  It was more about splitting up the young family.  I didn't really care in the end that I was knocked out of first class.  They just wanted us all together to make it easier.  I would have cared.  I would have been annoyed.  If I booked first class and they told me I can't fly first class, I'm fucking pissed. 
[04:10:00]  It happens.  Well, obviously I care, but then at that point I just wanted us all to sit together, and  they just didn't give a fuck about that whatsoever.  And other than the change of plane, they didn't address it at all.  I usually just bang on the cockpit door and go, then let me sit in here.  Yeah.  Open up.  I want to meet the pilot.  Make sure he's competent as we're taking off.  Yes.  What do they say about the floozy that they put in first class when it was between the  floozy and a young family?  That wasn't addressed.  You didn't write floozy in our complaint? 
[04:10:30]  No, I kept it professional.  You should have.  You should have wrote, what about the floozy?  Keep it professional.  Very good.  Yeah.  No, I like to take the high road.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  You can call her.  Floozy is taking the high road if you think about it.  That's true.  Do you know what you could call her?  There's plenty of other words.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's good.  And the Nagel trip was a success.  So you flew a United Airlines flight business? 
[04:11:00]  Why were they?  There's no business section on international flight.  It's called Economy Plus.  Oh, shit.  It's supposed to be business.  It's supposed to be three classes.  Yeah.  Economy Plus, Economy, and First Class.  What kind of plane?  Uh, 767.  Damn.  Yeah.  But why was the staff shitty?  Well, on the way back, it wasn't...  A wide body and a wide body.  Iraq, I apologize for Anthony's insensitive and Connie body dysmorphia comments about you.  I got a lot of texts asking me if I was at the Vatican, Jim. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, the Vatican.  Wow.  How did we miss that one?  Did you say it?  I must have misspoken.  But it was not meant.  No.  My humble apologies.  Why was it delivered to you?  I want to know why they were shitty.  Uh, maybe the ethnicity of the people.  Ethnicity?  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  I got the word wrong.  Are you speaking Italian still?  Yes, you did.  Yeah.  The ethnicity of the stewardesses probably played into why they weren't the most friendliest. 
[04:12:00]  Interesting.  Being from Russia.  Oh, they were Russia.  Oh, Russia.  Sit down.  Shut up.  Right?  Right.  You sit down.  You have a Bloody Mary.  Would you like lapdance?  Yeah.  They're trying to get you to give them 20 bucks.  Sit down and have a Bloody Mary.  So they give you, you know, the cup with the tomato juice and they give you a bottle of vodka.  Sure.  And you obviously do not have enough tomato juice to finish the bottle of vodka.  So you want the can.  Right? 
[04:12:30]  For the Bloody Mary mix.  Uh-huh.  I understand completely.  They're walking away.  Can I have the can?  No.  Why?  And then she wouldn't give me the can.  Why?  Is it a weapon or something?  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And then she did it to this other guy in a row behind me.  He had a soda or something.  He said, can I just have the can?  And no, she wouldn't do it.  Did you ask if you could have another cup and then pour it into the other cup?  Well, how about they don't give you the can because it's metal or something, then...  But they did it on the flight there.  Yeah, there's never any real...  So what? 
[04:13:00]  They have a whole bunch of cans with, you know...  Half-filled.  Half...  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So the fucks is what it is.  That is true.  But when you get other, what do they call it, flight attendants now, not stewardesses.  Yeah.  They're stewardesses.  They're degrading.  Is it?  If you ask the other people or, you know, maybe the gentlemen who are handling those responsibilities,  like, no, they can't.  Sure, here you go.  They're giving you napkins.  Oh, yeah.  Why is it degrading to call them waitresses?  Because that's all they really are.  What else do they really do?  Because if a restaurant was plummeting toward Earth, the waitresses wouldn't know what to do. 
[04:13:30]  Oh, and the flight attendants are trained in safety procedures.  Oh, are they?  Really?  Right.  Okay.  Let's say you're hanging out at your favorite restaurant, and it all of a sudden loses cabin  pressure.  What's the waitress going to do?  What is the stewardess going to do?  Nothing.  She'll know, you know.  Oh, stop it.  All right, everyone, put on your masks.  At that point, I just hope we have a really good, trained pilot.  You got it?  Yeah.  I'm not counting on the waitress in the sky for anything. 
[04:14:00]  What do you got, Kenny?  They like to be called plane servants.  Plane servants.  I bet they hate that one.  Hey, plane servant.  Hey, plane servant.  Fetch me a pillow.  Fetch me a pillow.  Oh, boy.  That would be a treat.  You think they don't like that?  No.  Too bad.  You know what?  We don't like the fact that now there's no fucking, like, early retirement age.  They should be out of there a lot of them. 
[04:14:30]  Exactly.  28.  Yes.  Yeah, yes.  At least.  And a weight restriction.  130.  Yes.  Because in the old days, they knew it was a silly job, so they at least made them look  hot.  They were hot.  It was part of the allure of flying.  Well, they hired hot girls.  You know, part of the allure.  And some, uh...  Some feminist douchebag.  Some do-gooder had to say.  Ah.  And we want, and us women, what us women need is... 
[04:15:00]  Oh, really?  Did you even get a pillow, E-Rock, on your flight?  Yeah, they give you a pillow and a blanket that's pre-packaged.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  I do like those pre-packaged pillows.  I do, too.  Mm-hmm.  How was Rome?  Rome was amazing.  Did you see the ruins?  I did.  Did you see the Coliseum?  I did.  That's cool as fuck.  And I saw the Vatican.  Could you go into the Coliseum?  Yeah.  We went up...  In fact, we paid for this private tour.  Yeah.  They took you to the catacombs below the Coliseum, so they show you where the gladiators would 
[04:15:30]  come in from.  Yesterday, I called you gladiated.  Yes, I saw.  Your fans like to repost your comments.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw that one?  That's funny.  They bring you in through these catacombs where there's water dripping and it's cave-like.  They show you where the gladiators would come in, set up, get ready to perform.  They had a whole elevator system with pulleys that they would bring the lions and everything  up.  Yeah, the movie was great.  Well, apparently this thing wasn't open until like four years ago. 
[04:16:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I thought it was open thousands of years ago.  No, the catacombs.  Oh.  They weren't letting you down there.  Why not?  I guess safety issues.  They opened it 16 years ago, then they shut it, and then they only reopened it like four  years ago.  So not many people have seen that.  No.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So you get to go under and you look up from under the...  They rebuilt part of the stage because it was all wood, and you look up from there and  you can see all the way to the top, which is cool.  And then they bring you all the way to the top of the Coliseum, and you get to look down.  How much is the tour?  I don't know.  Is it big compared to a baseball stadium? 
[04:16:30]  How big is it?  Yeah, like a minor league style.  Minor league stadium, like Bears Stadium, Newark, kind of a thing?  Well, go with Yankee.  Yankee Stadium, like half of Yankee Stadium or something like that?  It's much smaller than Yankee Stadium.  Much smaller than Yankee Stadium, yeah.  Trying to get a grasp on it.  Like a hockey arena?  Maybe a little smaller than that.  It's in better shape than the Nassau Coliseum, though, right?  All right.  1983, I get it.  Yes.  Gladiators fared better than the Islanders.  Okay. 
[04:17:00]  Enough.  But Rome is a lot like London and New York.  It has a lot...  Like, all the buildings can't be touched.  Like, you can't do repairs and things.  And massive remodeling you can't do.  If you're going to fix some stuff, that's fine.  But you've got to keep the original authentic look.  Right, right.  But the stores that come in in the center and certain areas of Rome all have, like, a New  York and London feel.  Like Trump can't put his name across the Leaning Tower of Pisa?  No, no, no.  No, people will love it.  It's a great name.  It's a great sign.  Yeah. 
[04:17:30]  But it's very cosmopolitan.  A lot of good restaurants and hotels.  Every designer is there in the main square there.  Oh.  I gotta go.  Yeah.  That sounds like a lot of great parks.  They have a park that's almost equivalent to Central Park.  Right.  And it's just amazing to walk through.  Bikes and people taking, you know, wine and picnics and...  Wine.  A lot of bridges over the...  Each bridge is different over the river going through Rome.  So those are amazing to walk over.  And the whole place is just...  I needed more time there. 
[04:18:00]  See any war damage?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  From the big war?  Yeah.  There's certain buildings that they show you.  If the building structure was still intact where the building could just be added onto,  Yeah.  You had to keep the original building.  Oh.  So they showed you, like, where Mussolini's palace was.  And they show you the line where they try to match the original marble with...  I forgot what the other stuff is called.  But you can see it be rebuilt.  But you can see sort of the lines of where the newer material is compared to the older.  Did you see where they hung him up by his ankles? 
[04:18:30]  They showed you.  They did, huh?  It's not like an X, you know, in Dallas.  But you could go over there.  Yeah, that's where he was, you know, celebrated.  They won't let you near it, because I'm sure everyone's going to try to, you know, hang off of it.  Oh, that would be a selfie.  Let me take a selfie of me hanging by my heels.  That's pretty cool.  In the tour, they show you the only thing that Italy actually recognizes that was positive for Mussolini  was building this road from the palace into the Colosseum so that traffic could flow  and people could come and visit stuff.  But then there's no other talk of Mussolini. 
[04:19:00]  What else did he do?  Yeah, yeah, move along.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  That was his palace.  He built this road moving on to the Colosseum.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  That's it.  That's all we did.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  He'd been Hitler's weenie.  Now it doesn't work.  How long was the flight?  What are we talking?  Five, six hours?  No, longer.  The flight there was about eight, eight and a half.  And the flight back was ten.  Oh, fuck.  That's brutal.  Yeah, flew over France.  Well, on the way to Italy, we flew over parts of Canada, Greenland, London, and France.  It goes up to the Arctic Circle and down. 
[04:19:30]  You flew over London and flew over France?  Did you fly over Jimmy's underpants?  You said it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, now.  There were Chinese and Japanese.  My earphones broke.  Yes.  Huh?  No, it's the other thing Ant says.  Oh, yes.  So, yeah, the flight, eight and a half there, ten back.  It was amazing.  You definitely should go over there if you have.  Have you been to Italy, Ant?  Never.  You would like it.  I would.  I know.  I've got to get over there. 
[04:20:00]  Lots of public drinking in the streets.  You can take it from the bar and walk around.  Ooh.  It was World Cup time over there, so it was insane.  Oh, right.  So they were all crazy for Italy, of course.  Were they nice?  Everybody was extremely nice.  Yeah, nobody was really rude.  And almost everything had an English translation as far as the restaurants, the stores, because  they know where their money's coming from.  Apparently, Italy's destitute right now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, well, all those fucking European countries are kind of hurting. 
[04:20:30]  Did you feel unsafe at any time or no?  Honestly, no.  I did not.  And I walked around pretty much almost all of Florence and Rome, even the back streets  and stuff, and it never felt...  Now, who was that guy that you took a picture with?  You did have to watch out for gypsies.  They told you about...  Oh, gypsies?  Tramps and thieves.  Right.  Who was that listener?  Did he just spot you and say, hey, Iraq?  This is a weird dude, because we saw him when we got to that hotel.  My whole family saw this guy.  And he's with his family.  Right.  But they all dressed the same.  Like, him and his two brothers all dressed however the dad is dressed. 
[04:21:00]  Oh, gosh.  So each night, like, they had...  It's horrible.  Like, they had khakis and a blue blazer and some kind of plaid shirt and brown boat shoes.  And then the next night, they were wearing the same collared shirt with those thin belt  with the gold and dress pants.  So it was really weird.  And then one night, we came back.  It was after midnight in Rome time.  And he was sitting off into this little side area of the lobby,  watching the USA Ghana World Cup game.  Ghana.  Ghana World Cup game. 
[04:21:30]  Just with a big bag of potato chips going into his mouth all by himself.  Oh.  So you're like, hey, can I grab some of them?  I was like, that's a smart idea.  So, no, we had just seen him all over the place.  And he was always kind of looking, so we didn't know.  And then when he approached us, we were outside the hotel and they were getting a car for everybody.  And he just kind of walks through the crowd of my family and comes right up to me, like, right up to me.  He's like, I feel I should know who you are.  Uh-oh.  And I just kind of like, yeah.  Yeah.  And he said, you're E-Rock, right? 
[04:22:00]  And I said, yeah.  I'm an ego kid.  So he's pretending like he doesn't, oh, I haven't heard the show in a while and what's going on.  I knew what was going on and I wasn't even listening to the show that you were trying to find me.  So he's talking to me for a little bit, asking if I like Italy.  Can I take a photo?  Yes, you can take a photo.  So he took the photo and I said, what's your Twitter?  Oh, I don't have a Twitter.  Really?  You don't have a Twitter?  No.  I don't have it.  I'm like, do you have an Instagram?  He didn't have all this stuff.  Uh-huh.  So I kept looking.  A few hours later, I saw it pop up.  Yeah, he posted it.  That he had it up there. 
[04:22:30]  He lied?  He was a liar.  Why would he lie?  Why would he lie?  I have no idea.  Why would any of our fans do anything?  Right?  So I just didn't want.  A nice, valid point.  I took the photo because I didn't want him doing candids, like posting my family up and  talking like that.  Did you tell him that?  No, I didn't tell him that, but that's why I did it.  Because as soon as he said, E-Rock, my wife goes, oh, shit, and just walked away.  And then the family kind of.  She reminded her who she was married.  She's convincing herself that you were just her driver taking her there to meet some Italian gentleman. 
[04:23:00]  Right.  No, my family's back home.  Fury, y'all.  Yes, of an independent means.  But your family must have been impressed.  No, they weren't.  Why not?  They didn't recognize in Rome.  That's pretty sad.  No, they were annoyed about it.  That's a big deal.  Far one.  So they walked away, and I talked to the guy for a little bit, and then you know the rest.  You actually talked to them?  Yeah.  Maybe a minute.  Because then our cars came, and then we went to dinner.  Nice.  More spaghetti.  Sounds like a good trip.  Seafood over there is great. 
[04:23:30]  And everything that, it's amazing the translation, even though they have the same name for dishes,  is not how it's prepared over in Italy and it is in America.  Parmesan is not sauce and cheese and all that.  It's flaked Parmesan, and it's cooked in oil.  Oh.  So when you get chicken Parmesan, it was like pan-seared chicken in an olive oil with scraped  Parmesan on top.  Oh, okay.  That's pretty good stuff.  Yeah.  Everything was good.  And when you get scampi, no pasta, but the shrimp's like this big.  Oh, Jesus.  So you're sitting there, you're cracking the claws, and you're gutting it out with a fork 
[04:24:00]  and everything.  You're going to kill you?  You're going to gut your own shrimp?  Yeah.  I don't know if I could do that.  But they're huge shrimp.  They're like this long.  Big as you fucking head.  Do you vein them?  Yeah.  You got to pull the slug out of the middle.  You know, the shit in the dirt.  That's who you need.  Don't you just eat the vein?  Who cares?  Oh, it's shit.  No, it's shrimp duty.  I don't want a shrimp.  Oh, shit.  I eat the vein.  No, get that vein out.  Get it out.  Cut it up nice.  Crack the claws.  Suck it out.  Oh, it's good.  Crazy.  Sounds good.  I don't like doing my own food like that.  I always fuck up, and I can't get rid of the meat. 
[04:24:30]  I don't like any of that.  I just want to grab my fork and start shoving.  Yeah.  You don't like putting on a bib and cracking your own lobster?  I don't mind that as much, but that peel-and-eat shrimp stuff is a pain in the ass.  Yeah, they always forget a leg.  Or that covering over the tail of the shrimp.  You get it.  Shrimp condom.  You can never get all of it off.  And if you find a place that does shrimp cocktail, not a lot of them do, don't get it because it's not.  Their cocktail sauce is just a cocktail sauce and mayonnaise, and it's more mayonnaise than cocktail sauce. 
[04:25:00]  Oh, that sounds horrible.  Yeah, and they just kind of ladle it over the shrimp, so you're not even dipping it in.  That's horrible for shrimp.  Yeah, it is horrible.  They should do it our way.  We've figured out that shrimp cocktail over here.  Yeah, Americans are assholes over there.  I've seen it every place.  They all complain they can't get a large iced coffee.  I can't get cheese put on my meal.  Large farba?  Yeah.  Wait, did I make iced coffee, sir?  You have to.  It's cafe, Americano, and then you have to say a couple other things in order to get it,  but it only comes out like that big.  They don't have Starbucks or anything like a Starbucks over in Italy. 
[04:25:30]  They're not piggy boys over there.  People actually eat properly everywhere else.  If you pull over to, I guess, the equivalent of mobile on the run, right, that was on the side of the highways,  you go in there thinking, oh, I'll get a drink or something.  They have a coffee bar in there.  So everyone's just, when they pull over, they get gas, and while the car's being filled up,  they're getting espressos and cappuccinos right at the gas station.  That's weird.  And even, like, if you find a McDonald's or anything like that, right in the front is a huge cafe, 
[04:26:00]  and then you have to go around to the back in order to get to the actual food for a place like that.  Wait, that means you ate at a McDonald's?  I stopped at one.  I stopped at one.  You stopped at a McDonald's in Italy?  Why would you do that?  I wanted to see how different the menu was.  How different it was?  Yeah.  How different was it?  There was a lot of different stuff on there.  Like what?  Royale with cheese.  Something that we wouldn't expect.  What did they expect?  Their fries are all different.  Mayonnaise on the fries?  Yes.  God damn. 
[04:26:30]  They give you, instead of ketchup, they look like the chicken nugget sauce.  They put the packets of mayonnaise in the bag.  Wait, why were their fries different?  What do they taste like?  There's different kinds.  They had them cut almost like steak fries like you would get at KFC.  That's what I'm talking about.  Or you'd get what they called Las Vegas fries, which are the waffle fries.  Wait, instead of, they give you mayonnaise instead of what?  Instead of ketchup?  Yeah, mayonnaise is on everything.  Steak fries are king.  That's my favorite.  That's my favorite French fries.  Yeah, you like that?  Steak fries.  I do like a good killily fries.  Nah.  Killily fries. 
[04:27:00]  Not so much.  Killily fries.  Not so much.  Nice and spicy.  Shoestring.  That's good.  Not so much.  And I like your standard issue, McDonald's fries.  I like a nice steak fry.  And if they try to do anything barbecue, American style, it's barbecue mixed into a whole thing  of mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Everything's all made.  So how was McDonald's?  It was McDonald's.  They don't do ice in anything.  Why?  So if you get a drink, there's no ice in anything.  They just don't do ice.  And you have to specifically ask for it or they don't give it to you.  Because they're trying to give you your money's worth. 
[04:27:30]  Right.  Are there Asian Italians or black Italians?  There were Chinese restaurants throughout Rome.  We saw them.  Were they speaking Italian?  That's what I mean.  I didn't talk to them.  Did you see some Italian guys that were black, though?  I did not see a lot of black guys.  Like African Italians?  But apparently there's a...  I wish I didn't remember the name.  There's a black guy on the Italian World Cup team.  Oh, well.  That has a poster in Rome.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  It's like the guy.  He's the guy.  You know. 
[04:28:00]  I want to see a Chinese person speak Italian.  I want to see that.  In Rome, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got to be there.  That would rule.  How would that sound?  I don't know.  Anything else about your trip?  Oh, yeah.  I had to get my credit card and my bank cards all switched over.  Why?  Because you have to have this microchip in your car now.  What's that?  It's microchip.  Why?  Why do you have to have that?  Because over in Europe, they switched their whole system.  So if you don't have the chip in there, you have to provide ID or your passport or something. 
[04:28:30]  And sometimes it doesn't go through just because you don't have that chip thing.  So how do you get the new ones?  Before you go, you have to order it?  Yeah.  You call your bank and your credit card company.  They issue your same card, but it has this chip with all your information.  But what if they have that here?  Yeah.  What if you went over there and not?  Supposedly, it's coming to the United States.  We just haven't gotten it yet.  Hold on.  Yeah.  What if you went over there and you didn't know this?  Like I said, it would take a lot to use your regular credit card because a lot of places  have these systems where it doesn't always go through. 
[04:29:00]  Some do.  No, it's got to have this little gold chip on the side.  And what is that made for?  I have one.  Well, it's made for a few different things.  One, it's for, I guess, for identification.  It has all your info on there, especially when you're traveling internationally.  It's there to authorize the use of the card.  But also, on your hotel room key, you have the same chip.  What's that?  Because you can't...  Yes, that card works.  You can't use...  Fuck, now we all have to check out credit cards.  You can't use the room without it. 
[04:29:30]  Right.  You can't use the power in your room.  No.  So you use it to open the door to your hotel.  Then you put it into this little slot right near the door, and it turns on your air conditioning,  your light, and everything in there.  Because the whole place is so energy conscious that if you leave the room and take the card  off, everything turns off.  So you can't leave the air conditioning on to cool down your room.  Fuck that noise.  Oh, yeah.  I've been in hotels like that, but you can leave stuff on.  Bypass that bitch.  Right.  Lickety split.  It shuts everything off.  I got a shitty credit card.  Yeah, look at that. 
[04:30:00]  But why?  Mine's shit.  Well, that's because I'm an international guy.  Let me see yours.  Why?  I'll go over there.  Whoa.  What is that, a Bank of Mericard?  What the fuck?  Where's my chip?  What's that?  It's my black...  Where's my chip?  I don't know.  I hope he's got a Gimbal's card.  Whoa, words.  Jesus.  Gimbal's.  His charger plate.  I love when you go to a store, you're buying something, and you're like, would you like  a Mace?  No, I wouldn't.  Why would I want that?  I've got a credit card.  I fly a lot. 
[04:30:30]  Buzz off.  Why would I use that?  Shut up.  My no is very aggressive now.  I just go, no.  Because I don't want any follow-up questions.  Right.  It's like, well, but do you understand, sir?  You'll save 4% on your purchase today.  I'm wealthy.  No.  No.  Hell fucking no.  4% will be gone with the first purchase.  Whatever it is.  Or they don't give you the sales in the store unless you have it now.  Yeah.  Well, fuck them.  Tough shit.  Where is that from? 
[04:31:00]  Is that what they're doing now?  Yeah, like Dwayne Reed, Walgreens, those kind of things.  You have those little point cards, whatever.  I hate those.  They'll have sales, but you won't get the sales unless you have the cards.  I hate those little cards.  They're so small and I clog up my wallet.  You got a CVS card?  No.  Can't use them anywhere else?  Yeah.  Useless.  Take a hike.  It's just so they could then send you junk in your emails and everything else.  Figure out what you're buying and tie it to you and then sell your information to some  douche company.  But then also you're paying for your stuff with the interest as well because you can't 
[04:31:30]  pay it off right away.  Oh, no.  There's some trick there.  There's some credit card.  There's some credit card going on.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a wonderful trip there, E-Roy.  Welcome home, E-Roy.  Yes.  They also show Louie a lot over in Italy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I put a clip up on Instagram and Twitter there.  They do these blocks of Family Guy, Simpsons, and Louie.  Oh, God.  So he's all in Italy?  Yeah, and it's a scene where you're playing poker, so I put the clip up where Jim's getting  made fun of.  What?  Let me see that. 
[04:32:00]  And it's all in Italian.  And it's in Italian?  Yeah.  Let's see this.  Here it is.  E-Roy Radio on Instagram.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, you speak Italian?  Yes, I do.  Very good.  I didn't know Jimmy spoke Italian.  That's why I have the credit card, because I fly over there, and they have me dubbing  in Italian.  They fly me over.  First class. 
[04:32:30]  Private.  They fly me private.  Yes, private.  I saw Jimmy twice throughout the trip.  The one where you were backstage at Dane's concert.  Oh, right.  And that one where you're playing poker.  Yeah, I might go over there, just, you know, some Italian fans.  Ah, bonjour.  No.  And they'll be like, oh.  I'm trying to see if there's anything else.  No.  Oh.  The hotels don't have real bathroom doors.  Why?  It's a thin, frosted glass.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, how awful is that?  So you're just taking a dump in there?  It really tests the length of your relationship.  Oh, man. 
[04:33:00]  Why?  Because a lot of those doors, as soon as you're closing, though, you can't really...  Yeah, it's not that way.  Oh.  I thought it was one of those doors where you close it, and all of a sudden it turns white.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it's, you're sliding it, it's thin, frosted glass.  Oh, shit.  Like, if you had a glass with too much condensation on it, that's about the protection you got  on the door.  So you can see kind of a silhouette of you taking a dump in there.  Yeah.  No one wants to look at it and see their wife's knees.  Like, she's taking a, she's reading the paper.  So they really like, you know, looking at each other, taking, dropping hammers.  Dropping hammers. 
[04:33:30]  Some of the hotels didn't have washcloths, so you're using regular towels to...  They don't understand washcloths?  Or they don't have drawers in there.  They just have a closet where you hang everything, apparently.  So odd.  Where do you put your underwear?  In the suitcase on the floor.  Wow.  There's no point in taking anything out.  I don't unpack.  They can't make a mixture.  Do you unpack?  If it's going to be, like, a week.  The minute I get to you.  Dress, pants, and shirts.  If I'm just there for a couple of days, I don't unpack.  I live out of the suitcase.  It depends on how long.  If it's one day, then I'll save.  But if I'm going to be there for four or five days, I'm fucking unpack. 
[04:34:00]  If I'm just there for a weekend anywhere?  Before I shit, I unpack.  Oh.  I do.  That's nice.  Good to know.  It gets all wrinkly.  All right.  Well, welcome home there, Iraq.

Hey, I'm right here.  Oh, sorry.  I saw a good documentary last night. 
[04:39:00]  You did?  Yeah.  What the hell was it?  It was Six Degrees of Helter Skelter.  Whoa.  It came out in like 2008.  It's not a new documentary, but it's pretty good.  Was it out anywhere or just went to Netflix?  Went to Netflix.  Yeah.  Popped that fucker on there and really, ugh, just creepy.  Guy goes to all the houses and places that the murders lived at.  And Manson and that ranch that they lived in. 
[04:39:30]  Well, a lot of the stuff was knocked down, right?  A lot of the houses were knocked down.  Yeah.  The ranch.  It's so odd.  You see that mountain behind the ranch?  Right.  And he's standing there now.  And all the buildings are gone.  But, you know, mountains don't really change.  Right.  So you see that.  And he's like, I'm standing in the exact location.  Where the ranch was?  Yeah.  The Charlie Manson ranch?  Yeah, the little Charlie Manson old western ranch.  And he takes you to all the residents that were involved that are still there. 
[04:40:00]  He'll start this over.  It's very creepy.  Because he does it in like one of those death tour kind of ways.  Like the Graveline tour, remember, in L.A.?  Oh, God, yeah.  We took the Graveline tour.  The Graveline tour.  The locals hated that guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They were beeping and giving him the finger and trying to run him off the road a little bit.  Because he would drive around in a hearse.  Yeah.  And show you where all the people died.  All the big celebrities.  Did he still do it?  I think there's another version of it. 
[04:40:30]  Yeah.  Well, this guy started up his own version of it at some point and then decided to make a documentary.  And he kind of treats the documentary in that way.  Right.  So when he walks up to a residence, he gives you kind of the history of the residence.  Right.  And he talks to the people that live there now.  And he talks to the people that had bought it right after the murders.  So it's a whole different take on the Manson murders.  Because everybody pretty much knows what happened.  You think they got a good deal in the house?  You know what?  I don't know.  You think that was a steal?  They knocked it down. 
[04:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  The one main one they knocked down.  Built some big thing on it.  Big estate.  Sharon Tate one?  Yeah.  They probably couldn't take all the people coming by.  Yeah, yeah.  That one's gone.  They actually changed the address, too.  They changed the number of the lot.  And they also showed the LaBianca house.  And that poor bastard that got killed leaving.  I guess he was leaving the Tate house right when they were coming up. 
[04:41:30]  The killers came up.  If he left like two minutes earlier, he'd have gotten out.  And they just shot him in the car.  Poor fuck.  I didn't even know about that.  Yeah.  I didn't even realize that happened.  But I knew about all the other ones.  I'm surprised they did that because that wouldn't tip off the people in the house.  I guess not.  It was a small caliber gun.  They shot him by the gate.  And then they went in the house and did all that.  But he also goes to a coroner and gives the coroner all the autopsy reports on all the dead people.  And he gives a very detailed analysis of the records of how they were killed and what killed them and the stab wounds and everything. 
[04:42:00]  It's really creepy, compelling.  Good documentary, though.  Because it's a different take on the whole thing.  Let's see this trailer.  Yeah, there we go.  Let's keep watching trailers.  I love Trailer Day.  Let's forget that Roman Polanski was married to Tate when that happened.  Yeah.  And there was a weird thing about that, too. 
[04:42:30]  Roman Polanski was asked how long was Abigail Folger and her little pal there staying at the house?  Because the cops wanted to know how long they had been guests at the house.  And when he was asked that, he goes, well, apparently too long, which is like, it's a little eerie to say something like that.  Aren't you upset?  He never really showed any emotion on that thing, did he?  For that whole thing.  I don't know.  I haven't seen him interviewed about it.  I've heard things he said about it, which show that he was pretty devastated and he still misses her. 
[04:43:00]  It's like DiMaggio in Maryland.  Like, he just loved her until the day.  Maybe he's like that.  Maybe this is just the one for him.  What fucking lunatics, man?  Like, she was, Sharon Tate was the last one that they killed.  And she's sitting on the couch and they got her kind of tied up.  And she's just begging for the life of her kid, of her unborn baby.  Just begging.  And they're like, no, I have no sympathy for you, bitch. 
[04:43:30]  And then they just fucking start stabbing her.  Ugh!  Wow.  Crazy.  So has any of them, is Squeaky Fraum out of jail or any of them?  Squeaky got life for trying to kill Ford.  Ford.  Um, and then I think one of, yeah, one of them got out because they considered him kind  of retarded.  Uh, Clem.  The Clem guy, he, he wound up, wound up getting paroled, but none of the other ones had gotten  out.  Why should any of them ever be paroled?  At least since that movie was made.  I know one of the women have been, you know, the, the perfect, uh, convict, prisoner for 
[04:44:00]  decades.  And, uh, she came close.  They were talking about getting her out, but when you look at what they did, there's just  no making up for that.  You have to just, you know, take, the fact is you're going to spend the rest of your life  in jail and you should.  And you being a model prisoner, your reward for that should be that you're allowed to  fucking wipe your ass after you go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I know model prisoners are great, but if you stab a pregnant woman, you should, you 
[04:44:30]  should never get out for being a model.  You should just not be tortured because you've been a model prisoner.  Right.  Make it a little easier in prison, I guess, but that's about it.  Then there was a ranch hand at that stupid ranch that they stayed at that, uh, Manson,  um, and I think Tex wound up killing and they dumped his body and that body wasn't found  until 1977.  Wow.  Yeah.  They found that.  They weren't able to really get enough evidence.  And also, um, his, uh, Manson's first attorney was found dead and they suspect that Manson 
[04:45:00]  did it, but no evidence.  And then the tie-ins with the beach boys and, uh, the, the whole, uh, Hollywood scene and  the, um, the underground music scene, just a really interesting shit.  What was the motive behind him doing that?  Well, behind him to start a race war.  It was.  He wanted to start a race war.  He, he, he tried to make all the murders look like black people did it by like weird means,  like leaving watermelon rinds out, like eating, eating watermelon and leaving the rinds. 
[04:45:30]  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and leaving the, the rinds out.  And, uh, I know be walking around with watermelons and murdering people.  It's crazy.  So hack, but he was hoping to start up, uh, the race war.  All right.  But the Jews did it.  Why?  There were pennies by the body.  Wow.  That was hacky.  That is a hacky thing.  Maybe leave an earth, wind and fire album laying around, but something.  Watermelon rinds.  Yeah.  One giant condom. 
[04:46:00]  Right.  Jesus.  There's better ways to do that.  No?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, uh.  Might as well have went all in and had chicken bones.  Yeah.  Throw the chicken bones around.  How did they catch them?  What was the, uh, the evidence that first got them?  Um, they wound up finding a gun.  Um, they tossed the gun with, they thought with the woods on the side of the road and  wound up flying over the little embankment, landing in a backyard, someone's house.  And, uh, they found that, but, uh, they had arrested them for damaging equipment. 
[04:46:30]  It was something that wasn't even, uh, involving, uh, murder.  And, uh, some people just started talking.  They started getting wind that they had done it.  Yeah.  Um.  How about it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't one of them go to jail and, like, start telling his cellmate?  Yeah.  Started yapping about it.  It's always the way.  Was that Tex?  I think Tex.  Tex is a loud mouth.  His name is Charles, uh.  Tex.  Watson, right? 
[04:47:00]  Tex Watson?  Yeah.  But Manson wanted to be the only Charles in the family, so they had to call him Tex.  Tex.  We got, uh, Christine.  She's been studying the Manson murders for 20 plus years.  Oh.  Oh.  Christine.  Christine.  Hi.  What can you add?  Did you see this documentary Anthony's talking about?  Um.  I don't know.  I just turned on the radio.  Woo.  Woo.  I've actually been to the house.  I actually have a part of the, uh, Sharon Tate house.  I've, uh, been on tours.  I've, uh, went for the 40th anniversary, so I'm pretty into this.  Woo.  Can I ask you what the attraction is? 
[04:47:30]  Yeah.  I'm just curious.  That's, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Just, I guess the heinous crime, just so how far crazy it was.  And, uh, but, uh, you were talking about how they first got nabbed.  Uh, Susan Atkins was in jail for, I don't know, for some, something.  She started talking and they actually found some, uh, they were convicted in, um, I guess  Charles Manson for earth moving equipment.  Yeah, they had stolen some kind of earth moving equipment.  Yeah.  Some bogus charge. 
[04:48:00]  And, uh, you know, Susan started talking and everything else.  Um, thank God she's dead.  She died of, uh, I guess, uh, brain cancer.  Oh.  Was her name Susan?  Was that Atkins?  Susan Atkins?  Yeah, Atkins died.  Yeah.  She died in 2009, September 2009.  Bon voyage.  Yeah.  Good riddance to her.  So, and she actually wanted clemency.  She wanted to get out.  She was the one, right.  Yeah, yeah, for sympathy because she was going, fuck her.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Anyway, yeah.  But, uh, yeah, but Clem Grogan, uh, Steve Grogan, his nickname was Clem. 
[04:48:30]  He actually got out.  Yeah, he did have like a mental illness.  Um, he was a little, you know, slow, but, um, he ended up getting out because he actually,  uh, you know, he worked with the police.  He cooperated with them, um, in helping to find, uh, Donald Shorty Shaysbody.  Shorty, right.  He was the guy that was in the, uh, who, he was, he was the, uh, ranch hand, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  And what happened was he started blabbing to the police right after, uh, you know, all 
[04:49:00]  the murders started happening, you know?  And, uh, so he was considered a snitch.  So what they did was wind up killing them, you know?  Um, but there were so many murders, so many retaliation murders, even after, uh, you know,  they were all incarcerated.  There were still family members going around killing people.  They killed, uh, Donald, uh, Ronald Hughes, who was a lawyer who represented a couple of  the, uh, you know, uh, people on trial.  So.  Why'd they kill him?  Did they think he was not a good lawyer?  Uh, they just didn't like the way he was representing, uh, Charlie didn't like the way he was representing 
[04:49:30]  the girls trying to get the girls off, saying that, you know, they, they were trying to  separate the girls from Charlie and try to say that they were influenced and, and Charlie  wanted to run the whole defense.  So, uh, of course the judge wouldn't let him, uh, represent himself.  And, uh, you know, so he was trying to, you know, tell the lawyers, this is the way you  need to do it.  You need to listen to what I want you to do.  And so he, you know, didn't cooperate.  So next year, one lawyer went missing and was later found dead.  So.  Yeah.  God, you really do know.  Oh yeah. 
[04:50:00]  What was his hold over, what was Manson's hold over these people?  Like, was it, he was just charismatic or.  Well, you have to remember a lot of these girls were young and they came from families  that there was a breakdown in the family.  Uh, I mean, Susan Atkins family, her mother died of cancer when she was like 12 years old.  So, and they all got into drugs early.  So, I mean, I don't know that they, you know, when you say that they were influenced, Charlie  was pretty smart.  He really knew how to target these girls.  He knew which girls could be equally influenced. 
[04:50:30]  And a lot of the girls were already strung out on drugs anyway.  So, I mean, as far as influencing goes, it really didn't take too much to influence them.  Yeah.  Um, but the funny thing is though, you know, um, who was it?  It was, uh, oh gosh, uh, Bobby Boltele had gotten convicted or had been put in jail for,  um, the murder for, uh, Gary Hinman, who was a music teacher who was friends with the family.  And the girls were really upset about that.  Why was he killed?  Because he was called Cupid.  And the, he was one of the cuter guys, I guess, in the gang and in the family part of me. 
[04:51:00]  And, uh, you know, what happened was when he got, he got picked up for driving around in Gary Hinman's car a couple days after the murder.  And that murder took place in late, uh, late July, I think July 29th.  And the girls were really upset about it.  And they were complaining to Charlie.  So part of the reason why Helter Skelter happened was because Charlie said, well, maybe if I killed some people the way Gary killed someone.  Oh, right.  Bobby Boltele killed somebody.  And they'll think that it was a cop. 
[04:51:30]  They'll think that, uh, you know, that Bobby Boltele wasn't the real murderer.  And the real murderer is still out there.  Right, right.  Yeah, they were trying to.  Yeah, they thought they'd get their buddy out of jail.  Yeah, yeah.  By doing the same type of murder, similar type of murder.  And then, uh, the police would go, oh, well, obviously it can't be this guy because people are still getting killed like this.  So we'll let him go.  Yeah.  Great thinking.  It's amazing how much Manson, how, how, uh, influential he was. 
[04:52:00]  Yes.  But he also had a lot of connections in the community, in the Hollywood community.  In fact, one of his members, uh, and I can't, I think it was Brenda.  I can't remember her last name.  Brenda McCann, I think.  She was actually a niece of Angela Lansbury.  So, um, he was a family member for a while.  And, I mean, he had, obviously, connections with the Beach Boys, uh, connections with Terry Meltzer, Doris, Dave's son.  What was the connection to the Beach Boys?  I'm sorry?  What was the Beach Boys connection? 
[04:52:30]  Okay.  So, Patricia Krenwinkel and another girl in the family were hitchhiking along Pacific Coast Highway.  And, um, who was it?  Dennis Wilson picked him up one night.  Jesus.  And he, uh, brought him home, had sex with him.  Then he had to go to a recording session at his brother Brian's house.  And what, he left the girls at his house.  And when he came back later that night, the whole family had pretty much moved in.  They came to his house and moved in.  He comes out and he, like, worships, uh, Dennis Wilson.  He gets down on his knees, kisses his feet. 
[04:53:00]  You know, and Dennis was a little taken back.  But he's like, I'm not going to hurt you, man.  And, basically, Dennis Wilson adopted the whole family.  And they basically lived there.  And they basically, you know, stole all of his money.  Yes.  I mean, Dennis, uh, Dennis Wilson paid for, like, a hospital bill because they all had, like, gonorrhea and herpes and whatnot.  It was like a $1,000 hospital bill.  They wrecked his car.  They stole, uh, some of his gold records and, uh, sold them for, you know, drug money and shit. 
[04:53:30]  But did Charlie, but Charlie liked Dennis?  I probably loved Dennis, but that was, Charlie thought that was his connection into the music world.  Yeah, he thought he was going to be a big star.  I have his record, Manson's, uh, Songs.  Do you?  Do you hear them?  Yeah, I heard them last night.  Yeah, on the documentary, I heard a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, and, um, so that's how he got, Charlie Manson got involved with Terry Melcher, who was a record producer at the time for the Birds, for the Beach Boys.  And so, you know, Terry Melcher came out to the ranch one day to listen to them play, and he gave them $50 because he felt bad for them. 
[04:54:00]  But he knew that they weren't all that good.  Mm.  Charlie Manson put that $50 as a promise to make a record.  And so, you know, he kept hounding Terry Melcher, when are you going to, you know, record us?  When are you going to record us?  And, uh, finally, you know, everything just spiraled out of control, I guess, in the summer of 69.  Just so many things converged and came together to create what happened.  And, uh, you know, some people say, some, you know, people who have been really saying the murder say that, you know, some of the family members tried to doubt Charlie. 
[04:54:30]  And so, you know, he was losing control of his family.  And so, you know, talking about all this helter-skelter and yada, yada, yada.  And finally, you know, he had to do something to prove that it was true.  You don't yada, Charles Manson.  Yeah, you know, yada, yada, exactly.  You know, yada, yada, the man who will eventually have a swastika on his forehead.  Yeah, that was a bad choice.  So, was Terry Melcher killed or no?  No, no.  He, um, in fact, you know, he went, I don't know if you know, Charles Manson actually came to the face with Sharon Tate on, I think it was March 23rd, 1969. 
[04:55:00]  Um, she was about to leave for Europe.  And, uh, he came to the front door, Charlie, and he met with, um, Sharon Tate's photographer.  And, uh, big Iranian guy.  And, uh, Shatoki or something of that, I can't remember his name, but anyway, Terry Melcher was living at that point in the guest house.  And so, um, Sharon Tate's photographer said, oh, yeah, go in the back alley, he's back there. 
[04:55:30]  And Charlie was really insulted by that.  But, uh, standing behind the photographer was Sharon Tate, and she actually looked him in the face and later remarked to her photographer, that guy gave me the creeps.  Yeah.  And, um.  Oh, pretty perceptive.  Right.  But, uh, no, Terry Melcher didn't die.  He died, you know, many, many years later.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, yeah, it's just an amazing story.  And, uh, like I said, that documentary, uh, Six Degrees of Helter Skelter kind of, kind of gives you a whole different, different take on it. 
[04:56:00]  Well, that's the guy I went on his tour, uh, I guess, Scott Michaels?  Yep.  So, and he has a, uh, Facebook page, uh, Dealer Departed, and, uh, you know, he is, like, the total expert.  I mean, this guy knows everything.  It was really, uh, yeah, he, uh, the little subtle, uh, things that he was showing on the documentary are pretty, uh, cool things you don't really know or haven't seen in previous documentaries.  Did Squeaky Fromm get out of jail?  This is Squeaky. 
[04:56:30]  We're talking to him right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, all right.  Let me ask you, you try to assassinate a president and you get out of jail?  Yeah.  Hey, Hinckley.  If it was a Democratic president, her ass would still be in jail.  That's just my opinion.  Wait, is she out?  Yeah, she's out.  She got out in 2009.  Wow, she did, huh?  Yeah, she did.  Was she done with murderers or no?  She never murdered.  And you know what?  She was like Charles Manson's, like, top, you know, when Charles wasn't around, he put her in charge. 
[04:57:00]  But the funny thing is, like, he never sent her on the murderers that night because I think he knew in his heart, Charlie, that she could, she just couldn't murder.  Like, even with Gerald Ford, like, you know, even though she tried to assassinate Gerald Ford, there were really, supposedly, no bullets in the chamber.  Oh.  I think it was just a threat.  So, uh, you know, but, uh.  What is she doing now?  Yeah, good question.  Well, she not only knows, but, you know, the funny thing is, like.  Not only knows.  Well, we probably should, uh, keep track of her. 
[04:57:30]  Maybe.  I keep track of all of her.  We should probably tag her.  Yeah, yeah, maybe.  We should get a tag on her.  Does she have a Twitter account or a Facebook page?  Yeah.  A little Lynette squeaky.  Yeah, squeakster.  Some psychos out there love her and probably worship her.  Oh, I bet.  But the funny thing is, she and Sandra Good were part of this, um, I don't know, trees, air, water, some organization that Charlie started.  And they were supposed to, they're not allowed to be, like, associate with one another.  Mm.  Sandra and, uh.  No, I bet.  Can't get those two together.  Yeah.  But, uh, but Squeaky, she's, she's in that case. 
[04:58:00]  Yeah, she was one of the girls that used to go to the trial and, uh, support Chuck.  But it's, it's, it's creepy how much you know about this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You never really, you never really explained why that this, this is your thing.  Okay, here's the deal.  My dad was a cop and, uh, you know, I guess, you know, being a cop, he was, you know, into true crimes and stuff like that.  I remember when, and this, what I, what I consider to be the best movie on, uh, of the Helter Skelter movies was the TV movie that came out in 1976. 
[04:58:30]  I remember that one, Helter Skelter.  Yeah, with Charles, uh, with, uh, Steve Railsback.  Oh, my God.  He did a good Charles Manson.  Yeah.  Amazing.  But, uh, in a creepy way.  But, uh, the thing is, you know, my dad, he was like, hey, why don't we watch this, you know?  And I'm here, I'm like eight years old at the time.  I'm like, you know.  Yeah, and he was just into true crimes.  And from that point on, I was just like obsessed with that.  And, and.  Wow. 
[04:59:00]  I think a lot of people are obsessed with it because of his connections to Hollywood.  Because he was obsessed by Hollywood.  Yeah, it's that.  But, but, but killers like that, just the strange shit that, uh, they do.  It's, it's fascinating to people.  The John Wayne Gacy story and all those, um, you know, uh, the other serial killers around the country over the years.  It fascinates people.  They love seeing where these things happened and, and touching a little piece of memorabilia from it.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what the fascination is. 
[04:59:30]  Um, I, I'm not even saying it's an odd thing because so many people are into it.  Hey, well, look at the ID channel.  Look at all these CSI shows.  Yeah, yeah, there's so many crime shows, uh, real crime shows on TV.  Yeah.  And they're, they're great.  I, I watch a shitload of them on, uh, Discovery ID.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We gotta, hold on, hold on the line.  We got this guy, Billy.  He says his mom served with, uh, Squeaky.  Okay. </pre>
