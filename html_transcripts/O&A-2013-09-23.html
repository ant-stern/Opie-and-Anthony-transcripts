<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton hilariously dissecting a bench-clearing hockey brawl, particularly the goalie fight's comedic awkwardness.  They speculate on the financial pressures driving hockey's anti-fighting initiatives, highlighting a funny video clip of players removing helmets to circumvent fighting rules.  The conversation then shifts to their experience at a Metallica concert at the Apollo Theater.  They detail the concert's deafening volume, with Anthony mentioning his surprisingly good iPhone recording audio.  A humorous anecdote follows about a misinterpreted sarcastic tweet about lousy concert seats.  The discussion expands to the varying attitudes of musicians (like Jack White and Prince versus Metallica) towards audience phone recording, leading to a debate on whether bands still genuinely enjoy playing their classics after years of repetition. A caller shares an anecdote about the Ataris' dislike for their hit song.

The Metallica concert memories continue, including anecdotes about the crowd energy and Jim Norton's high school nickname.  They contrast the intimate Apollo experience with a truncated Yankee Stadium performance for a Mariano Rivera tribute. A listener confirms the stark difference in sound quality between the two venues.  Post-concert difficulties leaving the Apollo due to crowds and transportation are recounted, including Anthony's amusing fare negotiation with a town car driver.  Despite SiriusXM's generous provisions (buses, ponchos), a story emerges of two intoxicated concertgoers attempting to touch a traffic light from a double-decker bus.  A discussion on tipping, specifically racial dynamics at a bar near the Apollo, is also shared.

The hosts discuss their Metallica meet-and-greet, focusing on Jim Norton's determined picture acquisition attempt and his disappointment at James Hetfield's absence.  They debate their varying approaches to leaving concerts early and praise SiriusXM's event organization. The show ends with Anthony mentioning his wife's reaction to his enthusiastic air guitar performance post-concert.

A separate segment delves into Opie's embarrassing public air guitar performance with his children and his wife's resulting humiliation.  This leads to stories about his college air guitar band and a documentary on air guitar competitions.  The Metallica concert is revisited, focusing on the Apollo staff's reactions and Jimmy Florentine's frustrating attempts to get a photo with the band, detailing the logistical challenges he faced.  A caller, Darren, shares his experience as a Black man from Harlem and his over-tipping habits.  Jim Florentine joins the studio, discussing his iPhone purchasing woes and the Metallica concert's loudness (and his lack of ear protection), along with Metallica fan preferences and Mick Jagger becoming a great-grandfather.  Significant profanity is used throughout.

Another segment focuses on the hosts' and Jim Norton's attempts to get a Metallica photo, recounting past concert infiltration tactics. Norton's frustration at failing to get a photo with the full band, despite near misses and SiriusXM’s help, is highlighted, along with a past encounter with James Hetfield. They discuss strategies for a potential photo op on the Howard Stern Show.  A caller, Mickey, apologizes for a past mistaken identity photo incident.  The conversation shifts to leaving concerts early, Norton's podcast, and his stand-up appearances.  The NFL's weather-related game suspensions are discussed, with a caller offering a stadium management perspective.  The segment concludes with further Metallica photo discussion and jokes.  Metallica’s "Seek and Destroy" plays during a break.

The show continues with a discussion mocking over-the-top weather forecast reactions, specifically the use of Doppler radar on phones.  A caller, Derek, a stadium manager with a fear of lightning, provides humorous anecdotes. The conversation turns to the Washington Redskins name debate, the inconsistent application of sensitivity to offensive team names (Vikings, Bills, etc.), and the Atlanta Braves' tomahawk chop.  The NFL's strict player celebration rules are criticized.  The Emmy Awards are discussed, highlighting humorous moments like a seat-filler accepting an award and Merritt Wever’s brief acceptance speech. Bob Newhart's first Emmy and Neil Patrick Harris's performance are also mentioned.

Tony Danza, a guest in the studio, discusses his career ("Who's the Boss?", teaching), his views on education and political polarization, and shares an anecdote about an anti-Obamacare ad. He promotes his movie "Don Jon". The conversation returns to Jim Norton's Metallica photo quest, detailing his increasingly desperate attempts.  The segment ends with plugs for Jim Florentine and a Dish Network advertisement.  The after-show with Sam Roberts, focusing on "Metalligate 2013," is teased.

A final segment focuses on a staff member, Jim, whose dejected demeanor after failing to get a Metallica photo, even with the band in the studio, is discussed. His avoidance of Tony Danza and unsuccessful attempts to intercept a band member are detailed.  The behind-the-scenes chaos and the potential for a reality show based on Jim's quest are also mentioned. A commercial for Mama Mancini's Meatballs and a portion of Metallica's "Sad But True" play before the show concludes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on, live, at me? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people.  Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes!  Good morning, everyone.  It's Opie and Anthony time.  Hi, everybody.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Went right around the old circle right back to Monday, huh?  Yeah.  You know how this shit works?  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  You start there, and you're all like,  and then the week goes by,  you have a weekend,  you have a great time,  and then you're back here again.  Yeah.  It's like a game board.  That was a great hockey fight.  I just turned to Anthony after hockey fighting.  Yeah, it was a pretty good one.  You're not a big hockey guy.  No, but I do enjoy a good brawl.  Somebody tweeted overnight,  it was a nice little treat when I woke up this morning.  A beautiful hockey fight last night.  My God. 
[00:02:00]  Bench-clearing brawl.  Old school.  Everyone pairing up.  Yep.  And then the goalies went at it.  Which is the silliest thing ever.  I think that could be the silliest thing in sports.  Because they're on opposite ends of the ice.  Because they have no beef with each other.  They can't, they're not in contact with each other.  Can't even, like, shit talk each other.  They're so far away.  Thank you.  You can't even read their lips from that far away.  And they can't give you the finger,  because they got, like, fucking...  The big gloves on.  Huge gloves on. 
[00:02:30]  And all the padding makes it so they're not very nimble.  Right.  In a fight.  So all of a sudden, what?  They go, oh, you want...  Hey, you want to go?  What?  I said you want to go!  Wait.  What is that?  I can't hear you!  All right, I'm going to start heading your way,  because you can't hear me!  They slowly lumber out.  They lumber out.  They lumber.  And then next thing you know,  the goalies are squaring off.  Yeah.  And they look like two big, huge sumo wrestlers. 
[00:03:00]  They can't really move.  Yeah.  Half the fight is trying to get an arm free,  so you get a few punches in.  It's on my Twitter.  OP Radio.  Cheap plug, I understand.  But this was a great fucking fight.  What was it?  The Bruins?  No, the Sabres.  Excuse me.  The Sabres and the Leafs last night.  Holy fuck.  The linesman is calling for the training staff in a hurry.  Wow.  Yeah, whatever.  That's the longer form, I think.  That's a different clip of the fight. 
[00:03:30]  But, wow.  Pretty good.  Just a point that the goalies are fighting is just so ridiculous.  It looked silly.  They're fighting for, you know, their team colors at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Have some pride.  Have some pride in your colors.  You took off your uniform.  And what's going on with hockey?  You got to keep your helmets on this year?  That's what I heard.  Is that official?  Like, if you take your helmet off to fight,  you're going to get some kind of severe penalty. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, hockey.  Hockey, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Well, they want to take fighting out.  Is that the deal?  Don't do it.  I know what you're thinking.  We all know what you're thinking.  You're getting a little scared with this new world we live in.  It's a bad example for the children.  You know.  We want it to be a family game, like baseball.  You go to a hockey game, and the kids jump up on their seats.  They love it.  Yeah.  They absolutely love the fighting.  It's teaching aggression, which we don't need,  because that leads to school shootings. 
[00:04:30]  They should stop this immediately.  It's interfering with the game.  Right.  There's some goalies going at it.  There's goalies.  They're at arm's length,  and they're just trying to get one arm to move enough to punch each other.  Even the announcers were laughing.  Yeah.  Where the goalies are.  Oh, the goalies are on it.  Too funny, man.  But hockey, they're thinking.  They're thinking.  Yeah.  You know, we live in this PC world.  We can't have fighting anymore.  Even though it's worked perfectly for so many years.  But now, like everything else in our society, 
[00:05:00]  you've got to find what could possibly be a problem somehow.  And it all comes down to money.  There's no real problems.  It comes down to money.  Sponsorships for a family game.  Right.  It's a lot more lucrative than to, you know,  try to pay for gooning it up with these guys.  You're not going to get those, you know,  I don't think you're going to get Procter & Gamble on board.  Well, I mean, they've taken a lot of the fighting out of hockey.  Yeah.  It's down to, you know, now each team used to have guys 
[00:05:30]  that they couldn't even skate.  Their whole job was to just go out there and fight.  And now they've got maybe one position on every team for that guy.  Maybe.  But don't think it's for anything else but cash reasons, I think.  But hockey's scared.  So instead of saying no fighting, they're like,  well, I guess if they have to keep their helmets on,  maybe they'll fight less.  Yeah.  So then we officially did not take, you know, fighting out of hockey.  And then a couple of guys, I guess, got in a fight  and they took, they literally removed each other's helmets. 
[00:06:00]  Because that was legal?  Because that's legal.  They found a way around it.  They wanted to fight.  I saw that video.  It's hilarious.  So they took off each other's helmets.  Like, gentlemen.  And started fighting.  Like, I'll take your helmet off.  You take mine off.  Because you can't take your own helmet off to fight.  So they took each other's off.  No, wait.  Did they give each other the courtesy of actually taking the helmets off?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, there wasn't a punch thrown, like, until they both had their helmets off.  No, it's a great video.  It was out a week or two.  I guess a week ago.  I'd love to see that.  They were ready to square off.  And they're like, oh, that's right.  I can't take my helmet off. 
[00:06:30]  So they kind of gave a look like, I'll take yours off.  You take mine off.  Now we can fight.  Right.  And the other thing about the bench.  Yeah, here it is.  Is this it?  It's great.  That is funny shit.  We'll put some of these up on our Facebook page.  So they're ready to square off.  All right.  Let me take yours off.  That's great.  And now they just proceed to punch each other.  Oh, that's funny.  And the other thing about hockey fights really fast, and we'll move on to the Metallica show, 
[00:07:00]  which was amazing this past Saturday night.  The bench-clearing brawl happens.  They all square off.  And then something happens between the guy you're fighting, and you go, all right, you  cool?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm cool.  You cool?  Yeah, I'm cool.  All right.  Let's just hold each other for a little while.  Yeah, then they just hold on each other.  Skate in those little circles.  While the rest of our teammates continue their fights until they're cool.  Yeah.  They're not cool yet, but are we cool?  We're cool, right?  They were just punching each other.  What happened?  Right.  I can't imagine you, yeah, you get into a fight outside of a bar or whatever, and then all 
[00:07:30]  of a sudden you decide you're punched out, he's punched out, and you look at each other  like, we're cool, right?  Grab a beer.  Yeah, we're cool.  All right, all right.  Well, have a nice night.  We're just bludgeoning each other.  Sure.  Well, uh...  That just happened.  That's why we're bringing it up, so it's, um...  Yeah, I got it on my Twitter.  It's everywhere.  Fuck it.  You'll find it.  And I think we'll put it on our Facebook page.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Apollo.  Saturday night.  Terrible. 
[00:08:00]  Loud.  Oh, it was so loud.  I didn't go for that.  It was the loudest thing I've ever heard in my life, and I've been around a while now.  It was so fucking cool.  I couldn't even tell you what the second loudest thing I've ever heard in my life was.  Before the show, everyone was, you know, there was warnings all over the place.  Like, these guys are not turning down their sound.  They're pretty much bringing the shit they would, you know, play at an arena with. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, they said they're not going to tame it down just because they're in a smaller venue  as far as the volume goes.  And somebody said it could get nauseatingly loud, like, literally make you nauseous.  They expected people to actually get sick because it was so loud.  And I've never experienced anything as loud as that in my life.  Un-fucking-believable.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  This is how dumb people in Twitter are.  We had six row seats.  Yeah.  Amazing seats.  How about five?  Oh, yeah.  It was six. 
[00:09:00]  F is five.  It was six for us.  It was five, six.  Look at me.  Yeah, that was six.  Trying to correct you.  Yeah, six row.  You're right.  And I tweeted.  I literally, while they were setting up the stage, I tweeted a picture.  You could see how close you were.  I'm like, lousy seats from Metallica.  I know.  Because people just have to be dicks no matter what you tweet.  But this dummy goes, well, dude, you're lucky.  You even got to go.  Do you really not understand I'm being sarcastic?  As soon as you realize people just have to be dicks, then Twitter's a much easier experience. 
[00:09:30]  Which they're just idiots.  Hold on.  You wrote lousy seats from Metallica on your own picture.  I wrote that as a joke.  Obviously.  And then someone else went, you're lucky.  Oh, my God.  What an asshole.  But I tweeted.  Yes.  You could see there was a guy on stage cleaning up.  So you could see where I was.  Amazing.  Like a few seat heads.  Yeah, yeah, right.  How do you not know I'm being sarcastic?  I zoomed in on my pictures to make it look like I was in the third row.  That's the best thing you could do. 
[00:10:00]  So I was taking pictures, zooming in, taking a screen cap, and then sending that out.  I'm actually on the stage right now.  Look at me.  God, they were fucking amazing.  Yeah, they were great.  I took a couple of videos of songs in their entirety.  Dude, it was great.  Your one video was great.  It fucking...  Both are great.  Why is the sound that much better on the iPhone?  I finally found something that I'm pissed off about about my phone.  The sound is really fucking good.  Why?  I have no idea.  Was it a setting on the iPhone?  No.  I don't know if it's the way I was holding it. 
[00:10:30]  I think it was...  Yeah, I think my hand might have been in the way.  Dude, you got great sound off an iPhone.  Because it was really fucking...  Go to Anthony's YouTube page.  He did one and said, but true.  That's your...  That's...  That's...  That was great. 
[00:11:00]  That was so cool.  That happened.  That was so fucking loud.  That's from your phone, man.  That was so close to you.  What the fuck are you doing?  I know.  I like your videos because that's where I was sitting.  Yeah.  And then when he comes over to the other place, it looks amazing.  Yeah.  He's right the fuck there.  You're at the far right, man. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  And the video looks fucking great.  It's fucking like...  No, it's awesome.  He has McGillicuddy.  How the fuck did you do that?  You got to commit to it.  That's what sucks.  Yeah, yeah.  You do.  You got to decide, all right, I'm not going to really enjoy this song.  But I really did enjoy it.  It was amazing.  Yeah, he comes over to the other mic, and he's like right in... 
[00:12:00]  And then I walked up the aisle to get really close to it.  Oh.  Because I wanted to get, like, at least one really close shot of him.  Because he fucking looks so badass.  Yeah.  There's Anthony moving toward the stage.  It's like, dude, look how close that is.  You're fucking two feet from James Hunter.  He's singing, but Sam, it's true.  Your eye level is close.  It's so cool, man.  And then he backs up so he doesn't ruin his shot.  No.  Nice. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Years ago, you would have needed a fucking giant camcorder.  To get anything near that.  What are they talking about?  They wouldn't even let you do what you just did.  They would wrestle you to the ground.  Technology is fucking amazing.  Oh, my God.  The bands had to finally just give up on all that, obviously.  Yeah, except Prince.  What do you mean?  Oh, Prince is the worst.  He had to throw it out immediately for putting the phone up.  Yes.  Jack White, too?  These guys are fucking Jack White. 
[00:13:00]  What a guy.  You want me to gouge the fucking tat off your arm like fucking Gladiator?  Why not just enjoy this 2013 motherfucker?  It's the world we live in.  I want to enjoy it again, like later on.  That would be okay if it was like five or six years ago, but it's impossible to stop people  from filming your shit now.  Because the next app will be a black screen.  The next app is going to be something that you can film at concerts with without your  fucking screen glowing.  Wow.  Wow.  That's the next app.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  I'm sure people are already doing that.  Just get some fucking electrical tape.  Yeah, but hopefully an app will be easier.  You know, they don't want to put tape on their phone.  What do you mean Jack White does that?  He doesn't like seeing phones up.  He likes performing for an audience that's engaged.  So what does he do?  He tells people to...  Does he get pissy about it?  No, there's an announcement before the show that nobody can take any pictures or video  with their phones, and then people get kicked out.  Oh.  No.  He just lost some points for me.  Jack White should be cooler than that. 
[00:14:00]  Don't you think?  That's right.  So we're going to stop this shit.  He's notorious, though.  I mean, he did that Radio City concert where he walked out after 45 minutes.  Oh, that's right.  He's a douche.  He takes his live shows very seriously.  I can put your name...  So does Metallica.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  They were tight.  Did you like them, Sam?  Did I?  Yeah.  Oh, they were amazing.  Have you ever seen them live?  No.  Oh, okay, yeah.  It's my fifth time.  Yeah.  This is the most amazing fucking time seeing them.  I've never seen...  Yeah, without a doubt.  Dude, this is how close you were to that show.  It's great. 
[00:14:30]  It was like watching them in a fucking...  And you're watching them like in a garage almost, isn't it?  Yeah.  We saw them...  The first time I saw Metallica, I realized, was 85.  85?  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  Whatever.  Man.  I saw them opening for Ozzy.  I think it was their Ride the Lighting or Master of Puppets tour.  Maybe it was 86.  It was Ozzy's, I believe, the Ultimate Centaur.  Wow.  That was positive.  I go back to 88, 89-ish in Buffalo.  85?  Wow. 
[00:15:00]  Maybe.  I mean...  Good for you.  Motley Crue is 83 with Ozzy.  And I'm trying to think if it was these guys were on the next tour, I believe.  Wow.  I was telling Ant before the show, they can't get excited about playing these songs at this  point.  I know, right?  It's got to be kind of their job.  Yeah.  You think, and to Sandman, they're getting like, yeah, let's fucking rock this part.  Or it's like...  Like, how does that work?  Going through the motions, but they make it look like, you know, they're full of energy  and everything.  But I don't know.  When they hear that, especially a show like this, it might be being so close to the audience. 
[00:15:30]  I don't even know if they get excited seeing an audience anymore.  They've done it so many times.  Maybe at the Apollo, because it was a special place.  But in general, I don't know if a band even gets excited to see that crowd roaring anymore.  Dude, they fucking have done this.  I would love to ask these guys.  Well, that ain't happening.  They've literally played the song thousands of times.  Right.  Literally thousands of times.  So what makes it a little different, a little more special for them, you think?  Yeah.  I bet you the crowd reaction does do something for it. 
[00:16:00]  Huh?  The crowd reaction, I bet you does something for it.  Probably.  But you're probably right about arenas.  They probably have a tough time getting excited about it.  Yeah.  That was crazy.  They've been doing it for 30 years.  I would love to ask a band like Metallica, Stones, U2's up there, who else?  Pearl Jam.  I listen to the Pearl Jam channel.  I was telling Anthony, and you'll hear a live, let's say.  It's like, here's a live from 1996. 
[00:16:30]  Here's a live from 2001.  Here's a live from 2008.  You get the point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's through time.  And you think, and then you said, in between those times they played it, they played it  another...  They played it another fucking thousand times.  A couple hundred times.  Yeah.  All over the world.  So what excites them at that point?  Yeah.  I bet you it's the response from the crowd.  Yes.  Because still, you think, the adulation of my fans.  With jokes, you don't get the same response forever. 
[00:17:00]  It becomes...  Music is such a fucking visceral reaction.  They're probably sick of it at one point.  They gotta be sick of playing Let's Go With Pearl Jam Alive.  They can't get up...  So they know how to fake it to a point like, oh no, man, we're playing this for the first  fucking time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But in their heads, they gotta be faking it.  I don't know if there's that level of excitement anymore.  I just don't know.  Yeah.  Until you're in that position, I guess you wouldn't know.  So... 
[00:17:30]  I'd like to ask them, though.  Has any band ever kind of talked about that?  The burnout of playing these songs over and over again for decades?  I'm sure, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, for decades.  Seems like a pretty...  Pretty, like, pat question that you'd ask a band at some point.  But they don't...  But the difference is they don't go through the motions, though.  They're playing it like, no, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just, we love this fucking song.  But you know, he's probably going through his head like, oh, yeah, what do I gotta do tomorrow?  He's just fucking riffing like crazy.  And you're like, what am I doing?  I gotta rotate my tires. 
[00:18:00]  What do I gotta do?  Every note they've done a million times.  Yeah, yeah.  So to you, you're like, holy fuck.  Look at how he's playing.  He comes in.  Look at how he's playing.  That's great.  What a show.  The fucking...  Can't say enough.  For Whom the Bell Tolls was one of my favorite moments.  For some reason, just looking around and fucking...  Because it was such an older tune.  Yeah.  Man, did the crowd respond to that.  They responded to everything.  My nickname in high school by my girlfriend's friend, because I wore kangos, was For Humor. 
[00:18:30]  They would shoot...  They would...  I didn't know what it was.  They would be like, hey, how's For Humor?  Because I would wear those stupid cango hats that look like a bell, so they would call  me, like, For Humor.  As in For Whom the Bell Tolls.  God, really?  That's hilarious.  Oh, good.  Let's go to Cody in Kingston.  Cody, were you at the show?  Yeah, how's Jackety?  Hey, it's Tony.  T-O-N-Y.  All right.  All right.  No, I wasn't at the show, but I just want to thank you guys for posting the videos, especially  Anthony for posting the video.  It was...  I appreciate it as a Metallica fan and an ONA fan. 
[00:19:00]  I was at the Yankee game yesterday, though, and got to see them, so that was pretty cool.  Yeah, it was so weird.  I went to the Yankee game, too, and, like, there's Metallica.  They're out on the field, and obviously they can't bring an entire stage worth of equipment  with them, and it's fucking Yankee Stadium.  They need to be able to break it down quick and get the game started after they...  Because they had a Mariano Rivera, kind of a whole big tribute to him because he's retiring,  and that's his song, Enter Sandman, when they bring him out onto the field. 
[00:19:30]  And they didn't have enough equipment for Metallica to be heard at Yankee Stadium.  Because, again, they had to break it down quick.  So it's just kind of like...  Oh, really?  What the fuck is...  What?  You can't hear them.  So even through the PA, they couldn't pump that shit through the PA in a way that would  make it sound cool?  They did.  But it wasn't like that same fucking... 
[00:20:00]  That same sound.  I guess it didn't help that I was fucking six feet away from them the night before.  I'm like, yeah, this sucks.  But, no, it was absolutely cool.  Very cool to be there.  There's your reality.  There's all of our realities.  You're six feet away from Metallica.  Next day, you're...  Next day, I'm in a fucking crowd of thousands fucking trying to squint a view at them across  the fucking field.  It was very cool, though, seeing Rivera, that tribute they did for him before the Yankee 
[00:20:30]  game.  And poor fucking Andy Pettit.  It's his last time fucking pitching.  What do you mean?  He's not getting the same send-off.  At home, yeah.  All right.  And, like, he gets done.  You know, they go out.  And a huge ovation for him.  But nothing like the, you know, hour, hour and a half extravaganza they gave Rivera.  Pettit was a great pitcher, but he wasn't in the first ballot Hall of Famer or best anything  in history. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  He gave a curtain call.  He was all teared up and shit like that.  Maybe who was?  Maybe Pettit.  Pettit.  Oh.  But maybe he should hang in there for one more year.  Let them do the Rivera thing.  Right.  Hey, come on.  Fucking...  Even if he doesn't really pitch next year, but just, like, be on the roster so they  can give him a proper send-off.  That's got to suck.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you're also leaving.  Okay.  See ya.  Let me say hi to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Jeff.  All right, brother.  Hey.  I saw the Ataris at Rutgers a couple of years ago, and they had this one-hit song, Sandim 
[00:21:30]  the High School Football Rules.  And they totally, they just straight-up told the crowd, we fucking hate playing this song  anymore.  But we know you guys all want to hear it, so I guess we'll play it, sing along, have fun,  but they're just going to suck for us.  Well, that's your fucking job.  Get out there and play it.  Yeah, but a band like that, I mean, they don't have as many hits.  Radiohead, stop playing.  Yeah, those cocksuckers.  Creep.  Creep.  They don't play any of that good shit.  Karma Police, you won't hear that fucking song either. 
[00:22:00]  Cock.  Which goes to our point, I bet you this happens with all bands, but then you got the cocks  out there that have to be dicks about it.  Well, you saw Neil Young that time, and you fucking sat there and listened to it.  Oh, my God.  You need to hear the story again, because I'm ready to tell it.  A bunch of shit.  I'll tell it again.  Hey, Neil, how about one for us?  One for us.  Ah, shit.  Fucking, yeah, you want to hear those hits.  Right.  Sorry.  I was wondering, when they were doing the show, that thing, I was thinking, they would 
[00:22:30]  have to play Enter Sandman, but are they going to rush through it, or are they going  to do some weird live version?  No.  A medley?  They put everything into it.  Oh, they pushed it hard, but I mean, besides Enter Sandman, we're talking even some of  the ones with, you know, Master Puppets, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, even those songs  have got to be kind of boring for them at this point.  It has to be.  They have played them a fucking million times.  They also have a nice size catalog, though.  When you have a good catalog, you can mix it up, which is probably why Springsteen keeps 
[00:23:00]  from shooting himself, because he's always doing different set lists.  But Springsteen can get away with not playing some songs in lieu of other songs, just based  on his fan base.  Right.  And then there are the hardcore Metallica fans that don't even like Metallica anymore,  that just want to hear old stuff.  But the majority of people that are going to go see Metallica, there are certain songs  that they're going to want to hear every time.  Right.  And those are the ones that they have to play.  But then, I mean, everyone can pick a song they wish they played the other night.  Mine was Wherever I May Roam. 
[00:23:30]  But I didn't go home going, oh, what a bummer, they didn't play Wherever I May Roam.  They did all good songs.  Yeah, I mean, geez.  That was fucking great, man.  What else did they miss?  Fade to Black, I would love to have heard.  Right.  Four Horsemen, I would love to have heard.  There you go.  Motor Breath of Kill Em All is fucking amazing.  They did Battery, they did Blacken, they did...  I would have loved Don't Tread I'm a...  Yeah, Don't Tread I'm a...  It would have been great.  I would love to have heard fucking Fuel, even though that's not one of their, you know...  Oh, that would have been cool to hear, though.  I would love to have heard off of Death Magnetic. 
[00:24:00]  You'd still be there, Jimmy.  Jesus Christ, all right, we get it.  They played for over two hours.  I can't think of a song of Death Magnetic I want to hear.  Fuck.  Yeah, they...  After In a Sandman, they left the stage and then come back for Creeping Death, which I stayed  for that, for that encore, and then I'm like, let's fucking roll, because I don't want to  be out there on fucking 125th Street, just waiting for a fucking non-existent cab, because 
[00:24:30]  the thousand people, more than that, are coming out.  So I fucking hightailed it, walked out.  It was like a movie.  I walk out, taxi, hopped in, boom, I'm out of there.  Yeah, because no one left yet.  My date fucking made me stay.  Your date?  Yeah, my date.  Who was that?  Sam Roberts.  Ah, Sam Roberts.  Hope he's a date.  Yeah.  A lot of times that...  You're such a prick.  What, did I want to experience the show? 
[00:25:00]  You didn't have a ticket.  I gave you the fucking golden ticket.  Oh, yeah.  And then you made me feel guilty that I couldn't fucking leave early.  I should have yanked your sorry ass out of there.  No.  Or since it's Manhattan, you guys could have left separately.  Well, his chick was at my apartment, so then I'm feeling like, well, that sucks.  What, I'm going to go home and go, I don't know, he'll be here eventually.  Yes, I'd have done that.  Sure.  Fucking ditched him.  I wouldn't have been mad.  You guys are both big boys.  The fuck?  From the guy that ditched E-Rock at fucking Giant Stadium.  Yeah.  Oops.  He's like...  Oops.  What show was that? 
[00:25:30]  Flat out ditched him.  I forgot what show that was.  Rolling Stone.  Oh, that's right.  Rolling Stone.  That was a giant stadium where there is no...  Oops.  Like, when you're in Manhattan, it's so easy to get to any place else in Manhattan.  That really happened, E-Rock?  You think about what you did.  It was for the show.  Oh, my God.  It made for a good bit on one day.  So I missed Battery and Seek and Destroy.  Seek and Destroy was really good.  I don't doubt it. 
[00:26:00]  But we could have been out of there.  But I had just seen a great fucking Metallica show.  A lot of the fucking songs I love and shit like that.  Yes, I would have liked to have seen Seek and Destroy.  It was so good.  But there's equity in also not having to deal with that fucking crowd, not getting a transportation.  That, to me, is an equal...  Yeah, especially to me.  It's like, that's fine.  And to me.  Yeah.  Not your date.  Not me.  Not me. 
[00:26:30]  Well, then you guys should have fucking hung out together.  I do.  I'm totally for the date.  Yeah.  Especially because they broadcasted the thing.  So in my mind, I'm like, all right, I got the great visual here.  Holy fuck.  I've been 12 feet away from the guys for the last two hours.  They did enter Sandman.  I know they're going to come back and do two or three more.  I'll find those songs and listen to them.  Both times they walked off stage.  I could tell they were getting frustrated, too.  Both times they walked off stage.  Because the crowd was getting...  Come on, let's go.  And I was like, no, just a second.  Let's just see. 
[00:27:00]  Hold on.  I bet they're coming back.  And then just try to avoid eye contact.  Especially in New York.  You're selfish, though, man.  Oh, selfish.  You got a free ticket.  You should have said, all right, that's cool.  All right, let's get out of here.  You're kind of selfish about the whole fucking thing.  Maybe, but...  And then, of course, we get outside and there's no cabs.  Those buses that the company got.  Which was a very nice thing, but...  Yeah.  I imagine a few people got killed on those buses on the way home.  A whole bunch of drunks just yelling and screaming. 
[00:27:30]  Fuck that.  In the rain, by the way, because they were the double-decker buses.  And, you know, with no tops on them.  Oh, man.  So they handed out SiriusXM ponchos to everyone.  They thought of everything.  The company thought of everything.  Iraq, comment?  We were leaving.  We were following one of those buses.  And we saw, as they were going into the intersection, two guys on the top level in the back of the bus,  jumping, trying to touch the traffic light as they're going through the intersection.  See, this is what I was trying to avoid, Sam.  A lot of people celebrating that show.  A lot of celebration happening. 
[00:28:00]  Celebration.  I'll tell you one thing.  And I've learned this before at the Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen show at the Apollo Theater.  You go to that bar.  If you tip the waitress, who is normally a lovely African-American girl, because, you know,  the African-American girls work in there.  Right.  Yes.  If you tip her, first she'll tilt her head, much like a dog when they hear a high-pitched whistle.  Because she doesn't quite understand what you're doing. 
[00:28:30]  She doesn't grasp that I'm giving her money for her services rendered.  A tip.  It's an amazing concept.  How much do you give her, though?  I tossed her a 20.  See, that's huge.  And, no, no, any tip would be huge for her.  Right.  She probably never sees one.  Oh, because blacks.  I'm thinking.  Oh, because blacks.  I forgot.  When BET is putting on a show at the Apollo.  It's the blacks.  I don't think many tips are rolling across that bar.  So, I gave her one.  Boy, every time I walked up there, I didn't even have to wait on line. 
[00:29:00]  She knew.  She saw me and went, oh, come over here.  Did you tip her again?  Yeah.  At the end of the night, I gave her another 10.  Oh.  So, but it was, first of all, it was free bar.  Yeah.  So, you got your money right there.  And then, I was fucking getting, like, wines.  And then, they were getting the little plastic cups of wine.  She goes, here, take this one.  And she gave me, like, a double glass.  Big glass.  Oh, she was the shit.  I wasn't leaving my seat. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I know.  Obviously.  I was back in fucking five minutes, if that.  Not only did you, then I had to go find a car to get us home also.  Oh, you had a child.  Even though you were the problem.  You had a child that didn't.  Yes.  We got to go home.  No.  Now I know what it's going to be like to take my son places.  You know what you were like?  Thank you.  When Travis and Lisa try to take Riley home from my pool.  Dude.  It's the same thing.  No.  There was probably ten people that left that concert early. 
[00:30:00]  So?  I would have been eleven.  No problem.  And I would have defended myself.  And he was, Ope was already a little frustrated.  Because he doesn't like to rush.  And I was rushing him to leave.  Because I wanted to get there in time for the meet and greet.  And Ope was like, I don't care.  Yeah, because I don't need a fucking picture with Metallica.  We got to go.  We got to go.  You're still fucking there trying to find transportation.  I'm fucking already in a restaurant having baby back ribs.  It was fantastic.  I had to negotiate with the collards. 
[00:30:30]  What?  To get a ride home.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know if you can say.  What the hell is that?  What?  What happened?  The Negroes.  There's no subtlety.  They're called African Americans.  I thought collards was okay.  No.  Back in the 50s.  No, that was like the 50s, 60s.  But if it was okay then, why isn't it okay now?  Well, times change.  Oh.  And then the guy got me bad.  Yeah.  The black cars.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's pouring rain. 
[00:31:00]  Town cars can pick up fares now, by the way.  Oh, they can?  They're allowed to?  Oh, because of Uber.  Yeah, they are allowed to now.  Because someone didn't want to leave early.  Now it's pouring rain.  And the double-decker buses were not an option.  So you took the extortion mobile.  Especially with the drunk baba buoys that were flying around.  What fucking year is this?  And then I see I'm on the corner getting soaked.  Because, you know, Sam's all nice somewhere under.  Oh, he's under an awning.  Under an awning.  I was in a poncho.  And he was in a poncho.  And I see a cab. 
[00:31:30]  And this guy pulls up.  I'm like, nah, I don't need you.  Fuck off.  Oh, boy.  I didn't say that.  But I was a little aggressive, though.  Like, leave me alone.  Keep rolling.  Because I see a cab.  And he's like, come on, man.  Where are you going?  And I tell him where I'm going.  And he goes, 20 bucks.  I'm like, no.  Because you don't know these guys.  These guys are.  They could be evil.  They might drive unsafely.  That's right.  So I see the cab.  So I'm like being an asshole to the guy.  Like, no.  Get the fuck away.  Right?  And I got my hand up like a goofball New Yorker. 
[00:32:00]  And then out of the corner of my eye, I see the cab light go off.  I'm like, oh, no.  Fuck.  And because we didn't leave early.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's now looking for cabs.  Yeah, there's no cabs.  All right.  So now I have to fucking go with the guy.  And then I'm ready.  I'm like texting Sam like, where are you?  But I don't give a fuck.  I'm making believe that I did try.  I was fucking finally like doing my own thing.  Uh-huh.  And then he goes, I said where I was.  He goes, I'm right there.  And I look across the street. 
[00:32:30]  There's Sam and Jimmy.  And I'm like, then I go to the guy.  I'll give you fucking 30.  But you got to wait for these guys.  You were going to skedaddle if we weren't there?  Oh, in a second at that point.  I'm trying to negotiate.  Because this guy, I'm like, all right, now we got to leave.  They're definitely done.  And then I take off.  And I lost you.  You couldn't even keep up as I was leaving the joint.  They told me you were in the bathroom.  Who?  Some of the people who worked there.  I left.  No.  And then Jim walked out of the bathroom and said, oh, I wasn't in there.  So that's why.  No, I was trying to get the fuck out of there. 
[00:33:00]  I was tapping a stranger.  I still beat thousands of people out of there.  Town car drivers?  Like last night, I went to take one.  Or it might have been Saturday night.  And I get in and he goes, 20 bucks.  And I say, 15.  I was 15.  And he goes, no, no, 20, 20.  I was like, 17.  That's it.  17.  It's just negotiating back and forth.  He goes, no, 20, but you don't have to tip me. 
[00:33:30]  I'm like, all right, whatever.  I would have given him 20 and probably like another fucking three, four bucks.  You know what that's about?  It's just negotiating.  It's just for the fuck of it.  Because even in the end, I knew I was going to fucking take care of the guy.  It's just that little play back and forth.  I like feeling like I'm in a Bangladesh marketplace.  Let me go to Steve.  You might have an answer to that question earlier about these bands that have been playing the  same songs for decades.  We hated playing Pendulum or whatever. 
[00:34:00]  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  Metallica, you can't tell that they might be sick of playing those songs.  I don't know.  You know, they give it their all every single night with these songs.  But we're thinking that somewhere in their heads, they're like, oh, my God, this again.  They're one of the best live bands ever.  Amazing.  James Hetfield, he's an amazing front man.  Steve, what do you got, buddy?  Guys, I don't know if you ever saw in Showtime, they have a history of the Eagles.  It's a really great documentary.  It's like three hours long.  But towards the end, when they go into the reunion tour stuff, Glenn Frey and Don Henley 
[00:34:30]  talk all about that, about how they were just sick and tired of playing all their hits.  And you obviously know all the great songs they had.  Don Henley made a great point.  He said, you know, you never know.  At any one of these shows, it could be somebody who's been waiting years to see you play,  and that's their first time.  Right.  And that was the one thing that kept them going.  And what, that's their motivation?  That makes sense.  Yeah, that's right.  It makes sense.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Jim, do you think I made the right move staying?  I'm trying to get Opie to stay? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, you made the right move proving to me how selfish you continue to be.  I always stay.  It's certainly selfish.  If I like the band, I always stay.  I was your ride, technically.  No, the cabbie was my ride.  You don't leave a movie ten minutes before it ends?  Yeah.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  You're never going to see a show like that again.  Like, waiting for a cab for a few minutes.  I don't like it either.  A few minutes.  But whatever it is, it's pouring rain.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Yeah.  Is it that, or is it...  I got my once-in-a-lifetime experience.  If they play for two hours and I miss the last 15 minutes, who gives a fuck? 
[00:35:30]  Would you leave a movie early?  Yep.  Would you leave a 3D movie early?  Yep.  Well, I would not.  I would not either.  But it's not like a story that I need to see the end of.  You don't know what they're closing with.  Well, it doesn't matter.  It's not like it's like a 30,000-seat venue.  Yeah.  It's the Apollo.  It's 1,200 people.  But it's all relative.  It's not set up for 30,000-seat leaving.  It's the same thing.  If you go to a stadium, they have a lot of roads, a lot of transportation.  So it's all relative.  Out there, you pop out on 125th Street, there's fucking thousands of people, and you got no 
[00:36:00]  transportation.  I would have been okay if it took an hour.  Absolutely.  I wouldn't.  I'd go crazy.  I've always left early, man.  WrestleMania?  Left early.  I did, too, that night.  Me and Jimmy were pulling out of Giant Stadium.  There wasn't a car to be had with their engine on.  I can't feel bad.  And we were laughing our asses off.  I'm not even joking.  We were the only car leaving with a full-packed stadium behind us.  It's not still real to you, I guess.  Yeah, we're not these wrestling fans.  Because at that point, you stayed at the end. 
[00:36:30]  Now you're putting two hours onto your night.  But it's the same thing, though.  Especially Giant Stadium.  That's a nightmare to get out of there.  I've left sporting events early, and all those assholes would go,  Uh, pussy!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They used to do that at Jets games.  Anyone who leaves early, they would just go,  Pussy!  I'd go, yep, that's me, alright.  But it's a Saturday night.  This was a Saturday night at the Apollo.  But when you know the event, like you've got enough of the event in,  or you know the outcome of the game,  Yeah, I'm out.  I have it.  I mean, you're a huge Pearl Jam fan. 
[00:37:00]  Out!  And you left before Jay-Z got on stage with him.  Ugh, stupid Jay-Z.  Thank you.  Who cares about him?  That's still a cool thing.  Want to see Toronto Jam?  Jay-Z.  But I saw enough.  Do you understand?  Yeah, but I, I mean...  I don't even know what songs I missed at this point.  I have no idea.  Seek and Destroy was the one they closed on.  Okay, great.  Great.  They did two encores.  And Creeping Death.  Three.  Yeah, right, Creeping Death.  I saw Creeping Death.  Yeah.  And that was awesome.  Then I was out.  Like, one encore, then I'm fucking out.  I like, I like to stay at the end because I like to applaud. 
[00:37:30]  I like, you know what I mean?  I like to fucking, uh, I just like the whole...  Applaud experience.  That's right.  I'm leaving.  It's a whole experience that you go from start to finish.  But if I didn't care about the band as much, if it wasn't Metallica or a band I completely  loved, that would be different.  I mean, if it was a band I didn't give a fuck about or kind of liked, I'd be like,  all right.  I care.  I care about Metallica.  I have to see it.  I thought it was great.  Yeah, if the show wasn't great, I would have been like, whatever, let's go.  I wanted my picture with the band, and I wanted my, uh...  Yeah, were you happy? 
[00:38:00]  You got to go to the meet and greet and get the photo?  I was happy.  I'll tell you this.  I was happy with the way Sirius took care of us.  Sirius took very good care of us.  Oh, they certainly did.  Very good care of us.  We beat the shit out of SiriusXM a lot, I gotta say.  And I even wrote, I'm embarrassed to say, but I even wrote Scott.  Whoa.  And I said, thank you.  Yeah, it was amazing.  And I said, holy fuck, did you guys run a great event.  I guess I should do stuff like that.  Yeah.  But I said, holy fuck, this event was flawless.  I mean, the listeners, it was a listener, it was a listener event. 
[00:38:30]  They packed the place with Metallica fans.  Yeah, I mean, in the past, they, you know, we just had shows just for us.  You know, Paul McCartney and Springsteen were just for us, really.  But this one was for the actual listener.  Yeah.  And, uh, wow, did they pull it off.  It was great.  And they made the listeners, I feel like they made the listeners feel like rock stars.  Like, everybody felt like there was a special event for them.  You know what I want?  Free t-shirts for everybody.  Laminates.  The shirts were beautiful.  I want a laminate.  I just didn't get one of that, and I would love one just to have it, because the shirts 
[00:39:00]  were fucking wearing it today.  They are amazing.  A lot of Metallica.  It's got the Apollo Theater sign on it.  It's simple.  Lightning bolt.  Black shirt with red letters.  It does look really good.  They did a great job with everything.  And they're soft and nice.  I'll give my, uh, t-shirt away to my millionth, uh, follower on Twitter.  Cool.  And how many are you at right now?  I'm getting close.  Okay.  I'm getting really close, so I'll do that for the people out there.  So, as soon as, as soon as, uh, I, I realized that James Hetfield wasn't going to make the, 
[00:39:30]  uh, the photo, I, my only thought, I didn't care.  I just don't care.  On that level.  I was just thinking about Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I was thinking, like, the elevator opens, right?  And a bunch of staff come out first.  Right.  We're all lined up next to the, uh, Sirius XM signage.  And, which, by the way, Mark Zito put up.  I watched him.  Mark Zito did a great job.  I watched him putting up the signage.  I'm like, where were you in fucking Montreal doing this?  Before anybody even came out of that elevator, Jim had said, uh-huh, I don't know, I hope  the whole band is here. 
[00:40:00]  I said, well, I knew only three of them were going to be there.  I had heard before, beforehand, that only three members were going to be there.  And I was, like, hoping, like, it was a mistake, but I kind of knew it wasn't a mistake.  Yeah.  And, look, it's great to meet.  I'm happy to meet.  I've met all of them before individually.  But to fucking get a picture of Lars Ulrich, Robert Trujillo.  Am I saying his name right?  I never say it.  Trujillo or Trujillo?  I never say it.  Probably Trujillo.  Trujillo.  And fucking Kirk Hammond is amazing.  I was fucking thrilled.  Well, yeah.  Do you have a shot with James Heffield?  Yes.  Oh.  And it's signed.  All right.  I've met all of them. 
[00:40:30]  All right, so.  But it's like a picture with that band, who's one of my favorite bands of all time.  It's a hard thing to get, because Metallica, I've only been with them as a band once in  my life, and that was 2008, backstage at Bonnaroo.  And Adam Dubin brought me back, and they were doing a photo shoot, and a part of me was like,  because they had just finished the shoot, and they were standing there.  I wanted to go, can I get a picture?  But I'm like, Adam brought me back on his fucking name, and I'm not a maniac.  I don't want to embarrass my friend and be a dick.  You don't want to be a shithead.  No, but I didn't.  And I sit there and looked at Metallica and did not. 
[00:41:00]  So how often do you get to do that in your life, where you get a picture of one of your  favorite bands as a band?  What about Giant Stadium, where we were backstage for two hours, and we actually left with  Hetfield's family?  Oh, God, yeah.  Did you get that picture that night?  No, because.  That's when I had to tap out with Jimmy and his picture taking.  Oh, I got that.  You met me for wanting to stay for the whole show, and you had to wait two hours?  It was me, Florentine, and Norton backstage.  That's right, and Bill Burr.  And Bill Burr.  Bill Burr, and we were trying to joke, and Jimmy did not want to hear any jokes, because  he thought our jokes were going to blow at an opportunity to get a picture. 
[00:41:30]  So we had to be on our best behavior for about, I'm not joking, two hours.  I got Lars that night, and I got Kirk, I think.  We walked out with Hetfield.  You never got him?  No, not that night.  Maybe at that point you didn't want to bother him, but we stayed so long, we went up  the chute at Giant Stadium with James Hetfield and his family, because Brewer knows those  guys really well.  I followed Hetfield and Brewer out.  But you never took the picture?  No, because...  After all that?  I got...  I think I took one with Lars that night, and I took a couple. 
[00:42:00]  Lars.  But it wasn't...  Again, I won't do things...  I think Brewer walked me back and got me Kirk Hammett.  I won't...  If somebody I know is with somebody, and that performer's weird or feeling private, I won't  jump in.  I'm not a fucking lunatic.  But that'll also drive you nuts.  So what?  It's my problem.  I know.  But that's not...  But I won't fuck with the performer.  Right.  So I eventually got Hetfield after...  The next time I saw that me and Florentine wait, because Jim, no, he doesn't care.  He'll wait.  It's one of those things where I like to do it.  I... 
[00:42:30]  But everybody knows I do it, and it was disappointing, because fucking...  Ah!  Hetfield just didn't make it back in time.  Yeah.  No, I understand that.  Your disappointment level is a lot higher than most.  Out of my mind.  Yeah.  Well.  Fuck.  And they're going to be here this morning.  They're doing Howard.  So I want to try to get them...  Oh, boy.  Good luck.  They'll probably take a few pictures after with the sign.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, no.  This is going to be...  But here's what frustrates me.  Could we be on Metallica watch for the rest of the morning?  We're going to be. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  Jimmy's like, where you already are.  Here's the frustration.  I have the same personal appearance as they do.  Right.  Now, obviously, we're on probably different priorities with the phone calls coming in.  Right.  But I'm asking...  Now, Pete is not their day-to-day guy.  Pete, you know, Adam.  This guy, Adam, I know, or Dennis is.  And it's like, I'm trying to just find...  Could one of you guys just hook up, like, just talk to whoever's going to be with them  and say, this guy just wants to take a quick picture, because Hetfield wasn't...  And I'm like, I'm not hearing anything back from anybody.  Oh, no.  And it's like, oh, fuck.  It's not good news. 
[00:43:30]  So that was really...  I like getting pictures with celebrities.  It's pretty cool.  But I just don't, like, lose my mind over it.  It was funny walking out with Jim, because after seeing that concert from start to finish,  it was, like, just present in your brain, like what an unbelievable show you had just  seen.  Right.  And seconds after it was over, Jim was like, yeah, it sucks that Hetfield wasn't there for  the meet-and-greet.  Who's even thinking about the meet-and-greet anymore?  I'll tell you why.  Because it was one of those things where you were this close, like, and you thought it  was going to happen until five minutes before. 
[00:44:00]  It wasn't like we just showed up there to this amazing show, and I'm like, let me see if  I can sneak back.  It was a part of the night.  Right.  So I knew we were going to the meet-and-greet.  And then I try to fuck with Jimmy.  Oh, dude, we were laughing at that.  I go, Jimmy, man, you heard Hetfield showed up for, like, you know, the last few people  online there.  And then Jimmy just spanks me back.  I'm like, I kept peeking.  He goes, nice try, but I went up there and I peeked right to the end to make sure.  He made sure that Hetfield didn't show up at the last minute.  Yeah.  He was having a little barbecue. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I think he was out eating or something.  He was at Dinosaur.  Yeah.  Which is down near the water up there in Harlem.  Lead singers are always a little, like, they got their own thing before a show.  Like, I understand that.  They, uh...  You barely understand that.  Yeah, but I do.  I wasn't angry.  I was disappointed.  Like, I wasn't like, fuck Hetfield.  I was like, ah, damn it.  So I'm going to try to get him this morning.  Because he's just, it's hard to get.  And everybody thinks I'm crazy.  Patrice usually goes crazy.  You thought I was crazy.  And then one time we were in this room.  No, we know you are.  And he's looking at my pictures.  He goes, you know, I used to think you were crazy. 
[00:45:00]  And I'm seeing all these fucking pictures.  And I'm like, I wish I had asked.  The end justifies the means.  Sometimes, yeah.  Like, now you look back over all these years.  And I have just a bunch of pictures that no one won't care about when I die.  No, I like getting...  I definitely get my share.  But I just can't worry about every single one.  But I love the show.  I fucking...  It was amazing.  It was one of the great live shows I've ever seen.  And what really makes your obsession fun is that there are enough people out there  so that once you get a photo that you've been waiting for,  there's always somebody else that you don't have to make you miserable again. 
[00:45:30]  I got most of the big ones.  This is just...  It would be an amazing one to have.  Yeah.  Because, you know...  Yeah.  How do you...  How do you...  Come on.  It's hard to get.  Hollow.  Yeah, very hard.  Yeah.  Anyway.  That was huge.  It was an amazing night.  I...  That was huge.  Jimmy got to notice this himself, but I went home and I realized that my wife doesn't understand  the air guitar.  Oh, no.  She was mortified. 
[00:46:00]  Were you air guitar...  Well, I've seen your air guitaring.  It's akin to Elaine's dancing.  But guys like to air guitar, especially around our age.  And I went home.  She was like, how is this showing?  And I was just, like, showing her.  Were you making the faces and everything?  All of it.  She...  Yeah.  She was horrified.  There's no one else in my house at this point.  And she's turning beet red.  She didn't understand.  I bumped into them...  I'm like, what?  ...the next day in front of the gym. 
[00:46:30]  And, uh...  I took...  I was taking my kids for a little walk.  And she pointed out...  I forget how it came up, but she pointed out how awful your air guitar...  Like, how uncomfortable...  And then he did it.  Oh.  And it was like...  We're just doing the fucking...  Oh.  But then I jumped in and played with him.  Oh, yeah.  And I did a little drumming.  You see how red she got?  She was fucking humiliated.  She was horrified.  I thought about that.  I could have literally stood there and done every song in real time. 
[00:47:00]  She would have walked away.  I was so happy.  She was so uncomfortable.  She would have walked away.  I have not enjoyed anything that much in probably a year.  Yeah.  Oh, is that great?  Because her reaction...  She screamed.  Yeah.  She's like, oh, my God.  Please stop.  She couldn't take it.  At one point, she went, ah!  And I walked...  And I turned and we walked into the gym.  And the people had stopped and turned around.  The people heard a woman yell.  And they turned and looked.  It was so sad.  And you guys were rocking out?  Oh, yeah.  Then I wanted Jimmy to do Guitar Army.  Where we do it together.  Like...  Oh, yeah.  And you got to tilt your head. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  That might have been a little much.  Yeah.  Faster.  Oh.  Fucking...  And the drums.  She really hated the drums.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, just drumming.  And she was embarrassed?  Humiliated.  Not embarrassed.  Absolutely.  It's the type of moment where, like, I saw her re-evaluate her whole life.  It's crazy.  Did I ever tell you about the Opster and his love for the air guitar?  Uh-oh.  I noticed you started doing air guitar before I even left the apartment.  So you must have been doing it all night.  Yeah.  Well, then when I knew it was a problem, I had to keep going. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when I was in college, we thought we were so...  We thought we were so fucking cool.  I figure I've told this story on the air.  I don't know.  I was living in Onondaga, which is a dorm up there in Geneseo.  And we decided the way we were going to get some chicks, we were going to get an air guitar  fucking group together.  What?  And we actually booked a gig in the common area of Onondaga Dorm.  Oh, this is so douchey.  And we played, like, the Who, and... 
[00:48:30]  What would you play, like, the albums?  And the Clash, I believe.  So you'd play the album.  And I wasn't even good enough in the air guitar band to play guitar.  I had to be the keyboard guy.  Ew!  So the Who, with the Who, with the fucking...  Yeah, I had to just sit there, like...  You were the keyboardist?  A keyboardist in an air guitar band.  The Opster thought he was cool, and we dressed apart, and we actually put flyers around  the dorm, and everyone came down. 
[00:49:00]  This could not have been the time you were putting up numbers.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  The keyboard player.  And we really thought we could, you know, get this going, where we'll hit every fucking  dorm.  We're going to have our own little tour around Geneseo.  Who would want to see...  No one.  Who would want to see that because you're not really playing?  You've got to pick out some cool songs, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, we had long hair, and we were just fucking happening.  Oof.  While real men were putting bands together. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, and actually, you know, putting in the time to learn how to play an instrument.  Right.  We thought all we needed to do was do the air guitar, or the air band.  Imagine getting kicked out of an air guitar band.  Yeah, dude, we're going to go with another keyboard player.  Holy shit.  Look, man, it's a thing online, though.  It's a documentary.  They have competitions and everything now.  It's a documentary.  Championships in Finland.  We're ahead of our time. 
[00:50:00]  There are people from all over the world.  We're ahead of our time.  There were national champions from New Zealand, from all over Europe.  There were media from all over the world.  The most surprising thing was there was nobody from the United States.  There's never been a U.S. representative at this contest.  I have one motto, and that's keep it real.  We're there.  Play the guitar.  Keep it real.  That's what I'm going to do.  This looks so stupid.  I might want to watch that. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, definitely.  It kind of looks funny.  It's called Air Guitar Nation?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  They really are.  How do I get this?  How do I get this tonight?  I've got to watch this tonight.  I think it's on Netflix.  Netflix.  It's on demand.  It was a pretty big documentary a few years ago.  Rock.  I mean, who hasn't taken the seatbelt while you're driving and just pull out the seatbelt a little bit?  Why don't you air noose with it?  Yeah.  Oof. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, boy, did she hate it.  Wow.  Yeah, she was beet red and mortified.  As well she should be.  I was embarrassed doing it, but it was so worth it.  I thought about that the rest of the day, how happy I was.  He was embarrassed to me.  The guy that will fart on a plane and fess up to it.  Sure.  But you were embarrassed at that.  I was in the fucking middle of the street in New York in broad daylight.  Oof.  And then we were doing it and people on Columbus Avenue were mortified.  That made me happy.  That made me really happy at that point.  So we continued doing it. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, a broad.  Yeah, a broad doing the air.  They're not even good at it.  Why would anybody watch that?  Huh?  Why would you go see that?  She's spinning her ponytails around.  Hey, man, they came out and saw us in Onondaga dorm.  Yeah, they loved you?  That's right.  The monster was getting some love.  I'm trying to remember.  I think Army was in the title.  Was it some kind of air?  Air Army.  Air Army might have been it.  Oh, God.  Wait, what was it?  Fuck.  Lost touch with those guys a long time ago. 
[00:52:00]  It'd be cool if it was the Air Force.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good air guitar band name.  How about the Doshays?  What?  I got it.  Oh, shit.  I got it.  I got it.  That's my cutest gentleman I got.  And because people really want to know, after the Metallic show, did I go for the Lucky  Charms?  Yeah.  No, I did not.  You went for the pizza?  Nope.  No?  Pizza's long gone, thank God.  What'd you do?  Not, I didn't take one slice of that pizza. 
[00:52:30]  Damn.  Did a little hummus.  Oh, okay.  What pizza?  Toasted the bread, a little hummus before I went to bed.  That's not as bad.  I should have just went to bed, though.  Well, yeah, but got to have something.  Had to.  Had to.  Ugh.  Look at her.  Air guitar players don't even hold their hand like a real guitar.  Oh, that's a chick.  She doesn't know how to play a guitar.  I know how.  She's clit strumming.  She really is.  This guy wants to talk about the Apollo Theater. 
[00:53:00]  Let's say hi to Darren in Louisiana or L.A.  Where are we talking?  L.A., Los Angeles.  Hey, Darren, what's up, brother?  Chilling, chilling.  I was just talking about the fact that I'm a black dude from Harlem.  Love you guys.  You too, Ann.  Oh, right.  You too, Ann.  I know.  It's tough to love me.  And I was thinking about the tipping.  I definitely over-tip because of that whole stigma. 
[00:53:30]  Good man.  Yeah.  Like, 80% and up, always.  Like, I have to.  Yeah.  Do you think the Apollo, let me ask you something, you're from that area.  I was thinking of the Apollo, and had they, because it was fun to watch some of the guys  that worked there.  They're just black dudes who probably live up in the neighborhood.  And, you know, they're like the ushers and stuff.  To watch them looking at Metallica, like, they were kind of enjoying it, but you know  nothing like that has ever been in the Apollo Theater before.  Yeah, they just don't understand it. 
[00:54:00]  It is kind of.  It's like, it's like, McCartney and Springsteen were different, because performers like that  have been there, like Buddy Holly, and there's been a million white performers in the Apollo,  but nobody like fucking Metallica has ever done a show there.  I don't like Metallica, but McCartney, yeah.  I would have definitely been there for McCartney, but I'm surprised we showed up for Metallica.  That was goddamn good.  It was ridiculous how good it was.  I fucking loved it.  Uh-oh.  Metallica watch?  Kenny said, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Kenny.  I want to know what kind of instructions Kenny had.  Kenny, what kind of instructions?  There's none.  There's none.  No instructions today?  We should have some kind of alarm when Metallica is here.  Yeah, we should.  Are you, uh...  What's going on?  They're due to arrive at 7.15.  7.15.  Oh, now it's that.  You're giving out pertinent information?  There's about a dozen people downstairs already waiting.  Oh, okay.  They're showing up no matter what.  Now there's going to be a fucking hundred.  No, I mean the Metallica fans.  Yeah.  I don't care. 
[00:55:00]  But the thing is, though, I don't think I've seen it before.  Huh?  What happened?  Are you trying to get the whole band, or just James Hetfield?  I want the band.  Hmm.  Possible picture of the band.  That's a tough one.  I know it's a tough one.  Believe me, I know.  Yeah.  If they put them in the green room outside, is that a possible thing, you think?  The green room in the lobby?  I don't know.  Oh.  Well, there's no talent handlers here.  Uh-oh. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, that's good.  No, it's not.  And I've already been spoken to once that I'm not to bother Howard's guests.  Oh, boy.  Who were you spoken to about?  Yeah, who told you that?  Um, there's a guy who never picked up his trophy.  He's not in the equation anymore.  Yeah, luckily.  He's out of the loop.  Yeah, that's a whole new regime now.  He said he's out of the loop.  We start over now.  Yeah, start from scratch.  We start from scratch again. 
[00:56:00]  Nice.  Ah, Nordic Thunder!  Oh, this guy must be a big dog.  I gotta see this documentary.  This guy is a joke.  Ah, he's prancing around the stage.  Oh, man.  You know, it's all in the presentation.  I guess so, huh?  Look at the people who are just sitting there, bore shitless. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, I wonder.  Oh, I thought this was going to be way more exciting.  Nordic Thunder.  Yeah, that kind of sucks.  I quickly realized I didn't have a career in air guitar.  In air guitar?  No.  Yeah, with the air guitar thing, so.  People in the audience are sitting there going, this really is just a guy playing air guitar  on stage.  Yeah.  Why am I here?  They thought there'd be something else.  But it's a competition every year, and they wonder why Americans aren't involved.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course we're not involved.  We have other douchey things to do.  Exactly.  I saw a documentary. 
[00:57:00]  I woke up to a documentary this morning on Richard Pryor.  It was pretty fucking cool.  Oh, I saw that.  Showtime.  Yeah, yeah.  That one was pretty good.  That fucking one line when he's on Carson, talking about using the word nigger, and Johnny  goes, you know, there are people in your community that are upset that you use that.  Have you come across people that are angry?  He goes, yeah.  And Johnny goes, what did you do?  He goes, I said, get out of my face, nigger.  Fucking great response.  But man, you don't realize how bad he was burned, that whole thing. 
[00:57:30]  And then it was, you know, a suicide attempt.  Fucking, he just watched that monk.  Yeah.  Burn himself in Vietnam, that clip.  And he's like, yeah, he goes, the motherfucker didn't even flinch.  And then his buddy just sees him fucking run by on fire.  Yeah.  Crazy.  It was a great special.  I mean, a great documentary.  People are loving the air guitar story, so.  Oh.  Just want to let you know.  Oh.  Maybe next time we do it. 
[00:58:00]  Actually, I might have to turn off my Twitter.  Oh, boy.  Killing me.  Next time we do a live gig, you should do some performance.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Right?  I might have to break it out.  Yeah.  But remember, I was the keyboard guy.  Right.  How did you play the air band back together again?  Air Force.  You think you could change over to guitar?  Air Force or Air Army, what was it?  Something.  Now, what happened that you didn't play guitar in this?  Did you try and they told you?  Because it wasn't my thing.  They recruited me.  Oh, no.  To be the keyboardist.  Oh.  I was recruited.  Did you try for guitar?  It wasn't even my idea. 
[00:58:30]  No.  Those two guys came up with the concept and they needed to fill in the band.  They needed a drummer and a keyboard guy.  How else do you play Bob O'Reilly?  Oh, that's true.  But you could play anything.  It could be a band that has three guitars.  So would there be a guy lip syncing the vocals, too?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I was putting on faces.  Oh, yeah.  Like, really fucking getting into it.  Would he windmill it and everything?  Oh, I have to.  This is so long ago.  I mean, I was probably 18. 
[00:59:00]  I think it was my freshman year.  80s.  That I still, to this day...  80s.  To this day, I remember the faces of people watching us.  Yeah.  And they were...  Did it look like Butthead when he said that?  Oh, yeah, exactly.  They wanted to openly laugh.  Of course they did.  But everyone was really wasted, because that was the days when everyone just fucking drank  their faces off in college.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, the good old days. 
[00:59:30]  There was punch all over the fucking place.  Jungle juice?  Should have been in your band's faces.  A lot of pot.  A lot of pot.  A lot of pot.  Jesus.  Son.  I do remember the faces.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We didn't pull it off.  No.  People were like, what the fuck?  You weren't rocking?  I remember we found a young artist.  Like, hey, we need a flyer.  We're going to put it around the dorm.  That's like something you would do as a goof. 
[01:00:00]  And you guys are like, we're going to make something of this.  I got to tell you, yeah, there wasn't a goof factor.  There wasn't?  Oh, man.  We thought we were cool as shit, man.  I mean, to be fair to you guys, I think conceptually there's not too much you could do with it.  Like, you guys could have been awesome at lip syncing to the record.  How about this?  The two guys that started it, we had a practice.  Oh, come on.  We had a practice.  There was band practice?  We had a practice.  Practice in your car while you're driving? 
[01:00:30]  No, we rented out the same space that we did the show in.  And we actually had practices.  And no instruments?  No microphone?  Nothing.  But did the guy sing in, like, hold a fake microphone?  Yeah.  When you were done with the song and there was silence, did you say, no, they're air applauding?  I just remember people were trying to hold back, like, just laughing.  Complete mockery.  Wow.  That's bad.  Why don't we play a song from the Apollo?  Ooh, what do we got? 
[01:01:00]  What do we decide on?  It's up to you guys.  I've told them the Belltol is the one I kind of love.  Yeah, the Belltol is great.  Well, let's do that.  We could also, maybe later in the show, play Seek and Destroy since Anthony missed it.  Ah, see, now I get to hear.  I don't know if we can play Sad But True when I tell you what winds up happening today.  Oh, Jimmy.  Is that all you're thinking about right now?  I haven't heard a word anybody has said in ten minutes.  Literally, if all of you guys said, you know, Jim, for the last ten minutes we were singing the ABC song, I would believe you.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[01:01:30]  He's not in line.  No, not at all.  But I know it's not going to happen beforehand because, again, they're going in to do an interview and I'm not going to grab them before they go in.  Did you bring your camera?  I do have that handy.  Hopefully, after.  Do you have a backup camera in case that camera hits the...  Well, E-Rock has a better camera than mine.  Yeah.  And I wonder if they're going to have a photographer here.  They might.  All right.  I'm sure they're going to take a couple group pictures today.  I doubt it.  Wouldn't it be great if, like, somebody actually had the juice and they were cool and everything, and all of a sudden they just came walking in and was like, hey, come on, we hear you want a picture? 
[01:02:00]  And, like, kind of did a goofy thing like that.  Yeah.  Or if they just didn't do that.  If they just said, okay.  Right.  All right.  That's all I need.  You even want all right.  That's all I need.  It's so frustrating.  I'm sure they take turns, like, not showing up for the picture taken and the meet and greets.  Oh, God.  And, unfortunately, you know, the other night, because to them it's probably just another fucking performance, basically, as far as the behind-the-scenes stuff goes.  Uh-huh.  And then it was James Hetfield's turn to not have to be there. 
[01:02:30]  But I would have felt the same way if it was Lars or Robert or Kirk.  I want the band together.  I talked to somebody who talked to Hetfield at the barbecue place he was at.  Hey, girls.  Come the lovely young ladies of the morning mashup.  Are they throwing the ball around today?  I don't know what they're talking about.  A lot of Emmy talk, I bet.  Are the girls throwing the ball around as far as the Emmys go?  A lot of Emmy talk.  But Hetfield said that he had to get back for the meet and greet.  Yeah.  So I'm assuming he just got back late. 
[01:03:00]  He wasn't specifically going, well, I'm not showing up to that.  When I saw the elevator open, though, and saw the staff get out and everything, and then  I saw the other guys from Metallica, they all come out, and then there was just like, wait, I don't see James.  All I was thinking, same as Ovi, I'm just like, oh, Jimmy.  Well, because then we know we're going to have to hear about it.  Right.  Because I didn't give a shit.  I was just like.  It was still kind of cool.  Yeah.  It was.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I didn't care.  All right.  Well, the Emmy's good.  I got lazy last night.  I probably should have watched those. 
[01:03:30]  They were quite, they were fairly boring.  Do we have a couple highlights after the break, maybe?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I do.  I'll be watching it for the first time.  Mm-hmm.  I just didn't watch.  I saw a little bit of the, I guess it was the open with the hosts all coming out, Conan  and Fallon and Kimmel.  They just filled up the stage with him.  Oh, yeah.  It was clever, though.  It was different.  Yeah.  Kevin Spacey was good in the opening.  Yeah.  I saw that clip on the news, yeah.  I was watching, actually, watching Breaking Bad, so I wasn't going to watch them.  I was watching New Jersey Housewives. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, you don't watch most of the shows that are nominated, so.  No.  New Jersey Housewives wasn't nominated for an award.  I had to see if that Gorg Abroad could pull off the song, you know.  No, I don't.  Yeah, she was at the Hit Factory and everything down there in Orlando.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  She had to perform the song live on a radio show.  Oh.  No wonder you didn't watch the Emmys.  Melissa Gorg.  What?  No wonder you didn't watch the Emmys or the Breaking Bad.  No, I got to watch my Housewives.  Episode before the finale.  I got to watch my Housewives. 
[01:04:30]  Is it bad to admit that I watched the Housewives?  No, it's something you can throw around with the girls when they come back from getting coffee.  True.  True.  No, it makes me cool.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Slow down.  It makes me cool.  See, I don't give a shit.  Do you play air guitar while you're watching the Housewives?  No.  No more air guitar, obviously.  He's doing it.  Oh, God.  I made the face.  This is where, as an audience, you should be happy we don't have a visual element.  He did it at the show a couple times. 
[01:05:00]  He would hit me on the arm and he'd go, hey, and he'd point to the stage and start air guitar.  It's like, no, I'd rather watch the guys really playing up on stage.  You're pulling me away from that.  It was either to slap me on the shoulder and it was either to show me air guitar or to  say, all right, buddy, let's get out of here.  Yeah, yeah, let's go.  Yeah, but I could have easily left an hour and a half in.  No problem.  I stayed pretty much, well, I did stay to the end.  You did stay to the end.  I very much thank you for that, but next time I'll take a subway home.  That's just because your chick was at my house. 
[01:05:30]  Out.  It was the only reason.  Or I would have left by myself.  All right, I was going to say, I said thank you.  You could have just accepted it, but you still have to go there.  And by the way, my YouTube channel is O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  You got two really good videos of Metallica.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You got Sabatru and Juan.  And we're going to play here, For Whom the Bell Tolls, from the Apollo Theater from Saturday night. 
[01:06:00]  So we'll be back.  Jim Florentine and Tony Danza today.  Oh my God.  Tony.  Tony Danza.  Tony Danza.  Hold on to your hats, kids.  It's Tony Danza.  We should see if you ever caught wind of that.  I know.  We have to.  You know Tony likes to relax backstage a little bit, huh?  Do you see where this is going?  And if they didn't, Tony would spell it out for them.  Just a fucking wrench over the head. 
[01:06:30]  No subtlety.  Remember all the women in line?  What did you say?  Hey gals.  Hey gals.  Oh shit.  What's up guys?  You got an update on the Metallica thing?  No.  I mean, I didn't even try because they're just, I guess they're just getting here.  Oh.  And I'm not going to fucking, you know.  It's just, it's not going to happen.  I know that.  But no, but people are sick of hearing about my fucking picture.  It's just my problem.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, they're not sick of it at all. 
[01:07:00]  Fuck them.  I'm just sick of it.  That's cute.  I really don't fucking care at all.  I love how Jimmy has to deal with his obsessions.  And he's going back and forth, like he was genuine for a second when he said, and now  he's mad.  No, I'm not mad.  Why are you mad?  You're definitely mad.  I'm irritated.  At your management agent.  Not because they couldn't do anything, but because I didn't hear from them yesterday.  But like, I don't know. 
[01:07:30]  I'm just being unrealistic.  I guarantee the band is going to stand in front of some kind of serious XM banner today.  Unless they do it in Howard's special wing.  Yeah, but then they're going to come out in that lobby, and I guarantee it's going to be  quick for executives or somebody.  I'm telling you.  You see how they come.  So why can't they just throw Jimmy on the back of that very short line?  Maybe they will.  There's going to be a very short line.  See how they come in the building, and that's how they're going to leave the fucking building.  Yeah, but he needs to get them all together.  You know how difficult that is?  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  He told a story with Sabbath where he's like, okay, you wait here.  Okay, I got to get...  I didn't mean it that way.  That story was amazing to me.  I meant like, if they come in, and it's very secret and shit like that, you will not see  them in the lobby after.  No, they didn't come in secretly.  I think some of them are here already.  Oh, yeah?  And I don't have fields here already.  Oh.  And they're just coming in.  They're going to be in the lobby, and there will be a group shot.  Oh.  And there's going to be a short, short line.  I guarantee it.  So what's the big deal if Jimmy gets on the very short line and gets a quick picture? 
[01:08:30]  Maybe that will.  I mean, again, that might happen.  That's very possible.  Remember I said this, because this is exactly what's happening today.  I hope you're right.  I'm telling you.  I hope they do a couple...  But Sam might be right, too.  They might do it on...  Thank you.  They might do it on Howard.  Because it's the Mandatory Metallica channel.  Now they're here for the first time since the Mandatory Metallica channel launched.  I'm telling you, there's going to be a group picture.  They may have done those group pictures the other night at the Apollo during a rehearsal.  Yeah.  They may have taken them already.  They had banners there.  They had banners there.  They may have taken a couple of shots like that for the platform. 
[01:09:00]  There's important people, I guess, upstairs.  And I'm telling you, if they...  But weren't a lot of them at the show?  No.  Oh.  Not really.  I don't know.  I saw some important folks at that show.  There's going to be group pictures taken today.  I'm telling you.  I'm not just saying that to irritate you.  I'm saying it because I know that's what's happening.  It's obvious.  So get Jimmy on the short line.  It'll be a short line.  They're not going to open it up to every employee.  That's for sure.  Oh, no.  From the other night at the Apollo, Metallica. 
[01:09:30]  Let's do For Whom the Bell Tolls.  You got that one, E-Rock?  Yep.  All right.  Let's do it.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Let them hear you. 
[01:10:00]  Let them hear you. 
[01:10:30]  Let them hear you. 
[01:11:00]  Let them hear you. 
[01:11:30]  Why did you not know?  Living war is a surprise  And if I was still alive  There's a raging war  I'm singing for the fight  Then they surely know  Oh, who's the birth of souls?  Thomas is on Apollo 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I'm right  Take a look to the sky  Just before you die  It's the last time you will 
[01:12:30]  I can roar, I can roar  With the coming sky  I can roar, I can roar  With the roar of this cry  Strangling our own desires  To this mystery  It's not so loud  Back from dawn on the dawn  Turn the wind to beat  And they see you open  For whom the bell toll  It tolls for thee  It's not so loud 
[01:13:00]  It's not so loud  It's not so loud  Absolutely  Absolutely  So close the air 
[01:13:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  On the Sirius XM  Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony 
[01:14:00]  You know, I was at that Yankee game yesterday  Where Mariano Rivera was giving his little retirement party and whatnot  And they had these moments that they put up on the video screens  I guess they went around all over the country  And just found former players that played with him  And other sports stars from completely different sports  And put them up on the screen  And they gave a little, you know  Hey Mariano, I just want to say you're amazing

[01:16:00]  I love the Galaxy  I still got an S3  I might even go get the Note  Which comes out in a couple weeks  I'm all about the Samsung phones  I love them  But it doesn't mean  I don't have Apple products  Or Apple phones in my house  Right  So we went to try to get  You know  The new iPhone  Yeah  Yesterday  The 5C  The 5S  Whatever the fuck it is  You know  I personally don't  Want an iPhone  But whatever  So we go there  And  And it's exactly

[01:17:00]  But it might just be  iPhone cases  We don't really know  We don't even know  Until we open up the box  Is what they sent us  Bullshit  You don't know  As the Apple store  In New York City  You don't know  What's coming  To be delivered  To your fucking store  It used to be  A thing that's  Supply and demand  And if you  You know  If you kind of  Let your product sell out  It creates demand  We all understand the game  But at this point  Enough already  It has the fucking  You got a new phone out  To fucking make sure  Every customer 
[01:17:30]  That comes into that  Stupid glass box  Has a chance of getting one  I don't want to go back there  It's ridiculous  You're not that cool  Sorry  I don't want to go back there now  It's not the iPhone 1  Where they don't know  How many people are coming for it  Exactly  They know exactly  Fucking 5C or E or D  Or whatever the shit is  They know exactly  How many they need  And why not  Just stock the shelves  And so whatever that number is  They go  Well you know  What we got to do  Just a little less  Than that number  Wink wink  Make people want it more  That game doesn't have  To be played anymore  No I think it's starting 
[01:18:00]  To annoy people  It's been raging people  I think it's starting  To annoy  It used to be like  Oh fuck  Okay I'll be back  I'll wait on another  Long line  Yeah  No one wants to do  That line shit anymore  Well that's why  I was saying  They make these lateral  They're doing the same  Fucking garbage  It's like  Just get enough phones  Dummies  Because there's Samsung  There's all these  Other options now  But they're just dumb cunts  It was just annoying  It wasn't like  Oh wow  Okay I'm part of  I'm part of a cool cult  It was just annoying  Yeah  Yeah  How do you not have 
[01:18:30]  Enough fucking phones  That's so stupid  It's old Alex guy  Sorry  Yeah and then they're all  Told to not  You know  Keep it all vague  Yeah keep it very vague  Keep it vague  So don't even tell the customer  When they can come back  Yeah  That's what happened  I went Saturday night  After the Metallica show  On the way back  I was like  Oh let's stop at the Apple store  Let's see what the fuck  Right  Go down there  And the woman's just like  No  I go well  What time can I come in  Then after the shipment  Comes in tomorrow  Well we're not really sure  The morning 
[01:19:00]  Kind of  Is usually when we get a delivery  But we're not sure  Yeah  What's in the delivery  Yeah sure you're not  I was just like  Disgusted  It was just so fucking stupid  Uh huh  It was just  Fuck wads  So dumb  Whatever  Yeah  So uh  Florentine you were at  The Metallica show huh  It was probably the best show  I've ever seen  Fucking sick  Really  Yeah  Sick  Cause just the sound  In that theater  And just being  Right there  In the front  I mean you know 
[01:19:30]  Eight ten rows back  Or whatever  But every seat in that place  Was phenomenal  It was the loudest thing  I've ever heard in my life  Did you have  Did you have your plug then  No  Fuck no  I'm like Norton  With prostitutes  I don't  That's like wearing a bag  Yeah  Yeah  Right  Like I've done it twice  And I didn't feel good about it  In every show I've gone  I put him in a couple times  I had to  And then I kept taking him out  And kept saying I can't do it  It totally messes  It's not the feeling  It's not the same sound  It's not the same when you fuck it  It's not the same feeling  How were your ears yesterday 
[01:20:00]  They're fine  I've been going  I've seen Motorhead  So you don't get the ringing  Or any of that shit  A little bit  But you know  It goes away  Yeah it goes away  It goes away  I've been at probably 500 shows  Yeah  Good for you  Yeah and it's like whatever  The only one I do is Motorhead  Motorhead  I mean if you thought that was loud  Motorhead would be at least twice as loud  As that  Tomas  Yeah  Easily  I mean it's insane  Wow  Really  Yeah it's not even  Even with earplugs  You've got to hold your ears  It's that loud  Wow  And Lemmy doesn't wear anything  No he don't wear anything either  The 
[01:20:30]  I would like to ask the band  Metallica  If they were  They were  I saw them  They all do  They all do right  All bands do  You could see they had the ones  I think a little  What does it sound like in their ears  Well they got the in-ear monitor  In the one ear  But how  How turned down that  Is that  It's not that loud on stage  For a band  Because they just have a little  Coming out of the amps  And they can hear each other  Yeah the PA's out  That way  So it's really not  Super cranked  Their stage line  Was blasting years ago  Because that's  Where the fucking guitar sounds 
[01:21:00]  And everything came from  And all those motherfuckers  Went deaf  Now  They mic those up  Send it through the PA  So they don't really need  A loud stage volume anymore  Like they used to  And since they're behind  The actual system  That the house is hearing  They're not getting  The damage to the hearing  That they used to get  But you listen to like  You talk to the fucking  You know  Any of the guys in Zeppelin  Or something like that  They're just fucking  Shot  Their ears are gone  The back of my head  Was vibrating inside  It was so loud  Oh man  I can't really explain it 
[01:21:30]  If you're not used to that volume  But no  I mean I can't tell my brain  To stop vibrating  No but if you're not used to  Going to shows all the time  In the middle of the back of my head  It was like fucking moving  What the fuck was that?  I don't know  That sounds like a tumor  That sounds dangerous  Thanks Jim  Shaking a tumor  I mean you're not used to  Going to super loud shows  Like what's the last  Like few concerts  You've been to?  Pearl Jam was  I go to one show a year  At this point  And I'm fucking lame  I used to go all the time 
[01:22:00]  Yeah  I saw the Carpenters  Once in the 70s  They were very loud  There's not a lot of shows  I want to go see these days  Yeah  But Tali  Absolutely  I wasn't going to miss that one  I'm trying to think  Who else I'd want to see  Right now  I can't think of anybody  Mumford and Sons  Mumford and Sons  Would be nice  That would be nice  You're not going to have  A headache in your fucking head  After that  Nothing's going to be  Rolling around  You're saying that was  The best show you've ever seen  Probably in the top three  Yeah  I'm trying to figure out 
[01:22:30]  The other two  Yeah I mean  To see them in that venue  To do like a two hour  And ten minute set  And a great set too  To be that close  Obscure stuff too  Right  Which is great  That's one thing with Tali  They don't just always  Just play the hits  I mean they got the  Eight or ten songs  They have to play  But they always mix in  That seven or eight  In that eighteen minutes  Eighteen song set  They always mix and match  For the real fan  You know for the fans  That know every song  From their catalog  The only one for me  I wish they played  Wherever I May Roam  That was it  Yeah I don't know why  I didn't do that one  Probably not at the time 
[01:23:00]  Because they did  Sad But True  It's sort of  Those two songs  Were sort of the  Secondary hits on  The album  So I don't know  Yeah  They just probably  Had to pick and choose  I mean if they did  The show the next night  They would have done that  But they've not done  Fucking For Whom the Bell Tolls  They probably just  Yeah  Yeah I mean they did  That nine minute  Instrumental Orion  Which is basically  Cliff Burton's song  You know so that's what  They throw that in there  For the fans  Right  Which a lot of people  You know  That's you know  Classic of the Master of Puppets  But they could have easily  Done wherever I may roam 
[01:23:30]  Yeah yeah  But that's one thing with Metallica  They don't always just do  The hits all the time  They'll do Inter-Sand-Man  They'll throw that in  But you walk away going  I wonder why they didn't  Play that one  I'm like good  You know for me  Oh no I didn't  I want to hear  I got it  It was cool  I want to hear the whole  St. Anger album  Really?  Which everyone hates  I want to hear that  From beginning to end  You like that one for real?  Yes  Very underrated  You know Lulu  I can do without  But  What are some of the songs  Of that?  I don't even know  The song St. Anger  Frantic  Right  There's some good stuff on there  Okay  People never gave it a chance 
[01:24:00]  Well maybe they go back  And rediscover it  They won't  No  Metallica fans are very weird  And picky  They only like the first  Four albums  Right  The 90%  I know  They cut their hair  As soon as they cut their hair  They're like  They cut their hair  So what does that mean?  They're in their fucking 30s  Sorry that you haven't cut it yet  Fucking sold out  What does that mean?  Yeah seriously  Is that  So now all of a sudden  They're not going to be  Ever since they cut their hair  They've been terrible  Because every fucking long hair  Metallica guy  Lived in their fucking mom's basement 
[01:24:30]  And whatever  Still lived at home  And got pissed  Like why the fuck  Now I gotta cut my hair  Because they did it  Right  That's a fucking funny shit  Right there  Mick Jagger is a great grandfather now  He's a great grandfather  That just hit the news  Yeah  Wait a great grandfather  Holy shit  Wait a minute  He's 70  His grandkid has a kid  Holy fuck  Wait a second  Oh my god  Wow  His grandkid has a kid  That's crazy shit man  That's wild 
[01:25:00]  Fuck  Fucking  Oh they came back to Metallica  I got a tweet from somebody  I retweeted Anthony's video  The one they played  One  Yeah  And fucking  Someone's like  Dude  That's what we need to hear  Another version of  Whatever  Whatever song I tweeted  Fucking  Either one or Sabotre  Sabotre or one  Yeah  I think it was one  The Metallica died in 1989  Did they  Dumb dude  Any Metallica fan  If you think the black album stinks  You're a dumb cunt 
[01:25:30]  It's a fucking  It's an amazing album  It's a masterpiece  Metallica fans got jealous  Because the black album  Was the first album  To get played on the radio  Metallica never got played  On the radio  One was their first video  They ever did  And it got a little play  On MTV  But radio was still afraid  To play that song  Because it was one  That's too heavy  It was scary  When they used to come  On MTV  It's like  Oh fuck  These guys are frightening  I was in Buffalo Radio  We played it  You did  There was a handful  Of those rock stations  That were brave enough  To play early Metallica 
[01:26:00]  Right  Yeah I know  But then black came out  And then they went back  And started playing  All the old Metallica stuff  Right  Then all of a sudden  Master of Puppets  Was getting played on the radio  And ride the lightning  But that's why  Metallica fans should  You know  Should respect the black album  Because that enabled  The band to get  You're right  I'm just reiterating  What you said  To get their whole catalog  Played on the radio  It's so weird  It led to that  With music  People get mad  When a band gets big  When it starts  Getting played on the radio  But that's what the bands want  So if you're a fan of that 
[01:26:30]  Why don't you go  Okay congrats  You finally got what you wanted  It's like a job  Where someone starts  As a secretary  In the fucking building  And then in eight years  They're the boss  They start at the low  Who doesn't root for people  To do better in their job  Right  Because they think  I'll tell you why  Because fans think  They're being rebellious  When they listen to certain things  So when other people like it  It doesn't feel like  A rebellion anymore  And that  So what happens  It's about the fans  And their perception  It's not about the music  It's about them feeling like 
[01:27:00]  Oh no  If other people like this band  I'm not as original  And unique  As I thought  Yeah  It's all about them  Of course it's all about them  Because their self-image  Is tied in with the band  Yeah it's like  I love seeing the band  I saw Metallica  Like their fifth show  Ever on the east coast  In New Jersey  Like a roller skating rink  No shit  Yeah before their first record  Ever came out  And I saw them there  And I  I've driven them to the mall  When Dave Mustaine  Was still in the band  As a little kid  I don't get mad  Like man they were in my car  One day and now  They're in a private jet 
[01:27:30]  This is bullshit  I'm happy for them  I'm happy that they're not  Driving around in a freaking van  Going to show to show  Whatever makes them comfortable  At this age  You know what I mean  So people  I don't understand that  That's Hetfield  That's Hetfield  We're looking at the  The one video  The one video  Holy fuck  They're so young in this  It's hilarious to look at them  They don't even look  Like the guys  How old is one at this point  Yeah what year  What year did that come out  80  88  88  I'm picking it  Justice for All came out  Yeah  Jesus 
[01:28:00]  So 25 years  We're up to right  With the band  Yeah this video is like  Oh man this is creepy  The guy's fucking  Has the mask on  He can't see  Or nothing  Oh that's scary  How old are these guys  Are they in their 50s now  Yeah Hetfield just turned 50 last year  So I think they're all about  Right about 50  Look at the head of hair on Lars  Wow  Oh my god  So they're like 25 years old  The fact that they're still  Fucking playing  And they're still  They're 50 year old guys  Doing a fucking show  As heavy as they did on Saturday 
[01:28:30]  You know I just want  Anyone that cries  That Metallica only had  Four good albums  And they died in whatever  Go see them  Fucking live in concert  And you tell them  And then you walk out of there  And tell me that they suck  They're amazing  But they won't  They're like  What are they going to play  Something off the load  You tell me  You tell me  Fuel's not a great song  That's a fucking great  Memory remains a great song  Yeah  Did you say  The problem is  As soon as someone  Sees like a little kid  Wearing a Metallica shirt  Or a Slipknot shirt  Or whatever band is popular  I can't like them anymore  Look there's a 12 year old 
[01:29:00]  Wearing that shirt  Yeah well 12 year olds  Wear Black Sabbath shirts  I'm not going to  All of a sudden  My history of Black Sabbath  Not like them anymore  Because some guy  Got his little kid  In the Sabbath  Or Iron Maiden  So stupid  It's about the fucking fans  And their images  Their own self images  Tied in with the band  So all that does  Is make them question  Their own self  Well good  Then those fans  Should stay in the  Little fucking factory  That they started at 19  And make $12.50 an hour  And never move up  In their job ever  Because I'll be jealous 
[01:29:30]  Dude I remember you  Jim I remember you  Used to work in that factory  In North Brunswick  And now you've got a nice car  And you live in the city  I don't like you anymore  You're the same fucking scumbag  You were when I met in 1991  And that's why I still like you  They're the worst  The fans like that  Are the fucking worst  Just little cry babies  Who don't want to admit  Well they changed  And it makes me doubt myself  And it makes me feel like  That's all it's about 
[01:30:00]  Also a lot  You were in radio  Knowing as a DJ too  You can't write a song  Going this is definitely  Going to be on the radio  You can't guarantee  That the song you write  In a studio  Is going to be on the radio  They had no idea  They had no idea  The Black Album  Was going to be as huge  As it became  Metallica's always done that  With every record  Has tried a different sound  A lot of them  Of course  That's what you got to do  So that's what they did  With that record  At that time  That record was  And it was MTV  Still playing heavy metal videos  If MTV wasn't playing  Those videos  That album would have 
[01:30:30]  Sold half the copies  It sold  That's a great album  Death Magnetic  Was a fucking heavy album  Death Magnetic  Is a great record  The last one they put out  I'm a good example  Actually  I didn't really know much  About Metallica  Before the Black Album  And I was in music radio  To be completely honest with you  But like you said  I love your point  When I heard the Black Album  I mean I wore it out  I was one of those guys  I wore it out  I'm like this is unbelievable  And then I'm like  Well what else can I get  From this band  And then I fucking discovered  The other shit  Yeah  For real 
[01:31:00]  I didn't know  For whom the Bell Tolls  And Master Puppets  I didn't know those songs  Back then  Now I love those too  Yeah  I went backwards with the band  Because of the Black Album  So  Hit the Lights was amazing  They started with  Hit the Lights  What a great song  I never  I heard that song live  Yeah that was their first  Song they ever wrote  Basically you know  Track one of Kill Em All  Yeah but I've seen Metallica  Five times  I don't think I've ever heard them  Play that one  Yeah maybe not  Yeah they're just a great band  Man you know  You just saw it last night  Anyone that was there 
[01:31:30]  Anthony I don't know  How big a Metallica fan you are  But what a show right  Yeah  Was that unbelievable though  Two hours and ten minutes  I know Sam was there  Yeah  He never saw them live  What's that  You never saw them live  They easily could have just done  A 45 minute set  Of course  It's for radio  It's a free show  Alright we're gonna get in  Get out  Give them an hour  Do the best hits  Get out of there  Right right  They did two encores  They even  I think the curfew  Then went past curfew  Too  Cause I saw a sign in the back  Said 10-15  Was a hard curfew  Obviously it was probably 10-30  But they played to like 10-55 
[01:32:00]  They made it to 11  Or 11  Yeah close to 11  Well no 10-55  You're right  I mean I think 11 would be the  Fuck we gotta pay for this now  Which by the staff there  At the Apollo Theater  The rudest people in  They hated everybody there  Oh really  Yeah and I'm just like  I'm just trying to tell everyone  I go look  I wanted to just go up to everyone  I go look  I'm sorry what happened before  Alright  I wasn't around  I don't even know if anyone  From my family was involved  I'm sorry what happened  I didn't before 
[01:32:30]  Yeah exactly I did  I wasn't brought up a racist  I'm not a racist  But don't take it out on me  That shit was a long time ago  Everybody was well behaved  At the show  So what if a guy was standing there  With a beer  Talking to his friend  Get out of the way  Move move move  Don't go in here  They were just so rude  Yeah yeah  It really annoyed me  I'm like get over it already  Alright I'm sorry  Jesus  I'm sorry  Who do I apologize to  Oh my god  You're the best  Did anyone notice that 
[01:33:00]  Not really in my area  I only dealt with one person  That was the girl behind the bar  And I tipped her really well  And she had no clue  What that alien concept  Of tipping was  People taking tickets  Or any of that  You didn't see any of that  Going on  I saw some  Kind of shit  Oh I got yelled at  For using the wrong door  Exiting  Yeah that was  Yeah  That was a biggie  And the usher  Oh where's the  Then you said  Where's the white door  But I've had  I've had such piece of shit  Ushers in every single venue 
[01:33:30]  Like when we saw Sabbath  Remember we first saw Sabbath  Back in the Meadowlands  When they first toured  With Bill in like 98  Yeah  Fuck it  At the end  Sabbath released this confetti  It was amazing  And it was these little  Black strips  That said Black Sabbath  On it  With like a little cross  Little teeny  So I'm picking one up  Off the floor  There's probably  200 million pieces  Of confetti  And it was  It was a fucking  The white guy  And he comes up  He goes  No you can't take  Any of that  This fucking cunt  That worked in the metal  No that's  No you can't take that  He was serious  Are you kidding me  You didn't say  Confetti  Confetti 
[01:34:00]  I've always thought  That most of the ushers  I've dealt with  In those places  Have been pieces  Of shit  Regardless  Like I've noticed  Across the board  They've been shit  The only place  I've liked the ushers  Was two weeks ago  In Irvine  In California  Maybe it was  East coast  West coast  They were actually  Very nice to the fans  Other than that  Every venue I've ever been  In the ushers  Have been twat  Did you take  A piece of confetti  Yeah I still have it  But it was amazing  I was going to say  If you listened to that guy  I would have punched you  I didn't  But he was just  Some fucking nobody 
[01:34:30]  You notice though  In the New York area  When you go  You have like a backstage pass  Or some kind of pass  Halfway through the night  It changes  That doesn't work anymore  I'm like it's all access  It's from the band  No  That's all access  No they just changed it  I'm looking at the chart  Nope you can't  Can only go here  I'm like who made  That fucking decision  What happened  What happened in that meeting  You had at three in the afternoon  Why did it change  Yeah  It's only on the east coast  That shit happens  That pass is no good anymore  But bands got smart  It used to be the backstage pass 
[01:35:00]  And next thing  You're just like  Pretty much  In their dressing room  And then someone goes  Wait a minute  We can have zones  We'll have like that  That's good for up to here  This is good for this one  But there was a time  You're just hanging out  With Robert Plank  Because you were lucky enough  Because you got a green  Fucking thing on your leg  Right  A sticky fucking  Like hey what's up Robert  Yeah  Looking forward to the show  There was no distinction  Between the sound man  And a meet and greet winner  And then they finally went  Wait a minute here  They both could just go anywhere  Yeah  All access  Yeah  Oh there was something  I could see if  You know bands 
[01:35:30]  Back in the day  Everybody was  You know  They only wanted chicks backstage  That doesn't go on anymore  At rock shows  Yeah yeah  You don't see any slutty chicks  Ever  Very rarely  So it's a bunch of dudes  Yeah  It's just a bunch of  Yeah it's a bunch of dudes  Just hanging out  So don't stop me  If it's because of chicks  I get it  Right right  I got one complaint  About the show  Just one little complaint  The guitar picks  At the end of the show  I got two of them  Well good for you  You know what I got  A huge bruise on my thigh  From the guy that  Dived into our row  Oh man  That guy was annoying 
[01:36:00]  The whole night  And fucking hit me  With his knee or something  And he's on the floor  Crawling around  Like a fucking addict  Trying to find  A guitar pick  Yeah you know the guy  I actually got a bruise  On my fucking thigh  And he had pushed you  Before that  Yeah  We got pushed around  Like motherfuckers  When he jumped in like that  I was pissed at him  Because he kept doing that  When he jumped in  I need his head  He just dove in  In front of us  To get picks  Because at one point  They just took  Fucking handfuls  And were just  Throwing it 
[01:36:30]  And man  Were people losing  Their minds  For those guitar picks  Someone gave me one  I didn't catch one  Oh  Kirk Hammett threw one  It was a little one  Not the big white ones  They were throwing later  Earlier he threw one  It bounced off the guy  Next to me's head  And it landed right up  By my foot  And I picked it up  And he's like  Dude come on man  Give me that  And I go  I got it  He's like  Yeah but it hit off my head  I go  I'll give you the assist  That's it  You get the assist  And I fucking picked it up  That's not how that works  Yeah he's like  You're on that metal show  You should  You have enough picks  I go  I don't have any 
[01:37:00]  They don't fucking give me picks  Right  So I tape the show  He was fucking pissed  The rest of the show  Because it was only  It was about three quarters  The way in  Kirk threw one out  And it bounced off his head  Did you eventually  Give it back to him  Fuck no  Not knowing they would throw  Probably 500 out  And then I got one later  Probably 500  People were actually  Giving them back at the end  Like we have seven  Right  We have seven  Jimmy wants to get  A Metallica picture today  We're in  We're in picture  Taking mode  Jimmy is  We're trying to  It ain't gonna happen 
[01:37:30]  I believe that  We're trying to work it out  I sense these things  And I'm usually right  I just saw  I saw James  Come downstairs  In the lobby  I said hello to him  You know we talked about the show  He said  Had an amazing time there  So he's in  He's in good spirits  Oh  So maybe you get it  Remember the time  At Giant Stadium backstage  You were there  Nassau Coliseum  That was another one too  That was when we got Hetfield  I'm talking about Giant Stadium  Where we were in the hallway  Waiting  And we all had to make sure  We knew how to work  His camera properly  Well we got them 
[01:38:00]  The fucking ritual  Right  We were there so long  We walked out  Do you remember  We walked out  With Hetfield and his family  We followed him out  His entire family  We felt like assholes  At that point  It was only the band leaving  Us and Brewer  And Hetfield  I like going to shows with Jim  Because you know  You're not waiting in any traffic  After the show  On the way home now  Yeah because you're there  For at least another hour afterwards  I think this was at least  An hour and a half  I think we were pushing  Two hours after the show  Probably  Yeah  Well worth it  And we had passes 
[01:38:30]  But we didn't have the passes  To go past the curtain  Remember  So then we were trying  To find the passes  That got us past the curtain  What a fucking  It's just too nerve wracking  But then we found out  If you got the passes  Past the curtain  There was another zone  After that  The dressing room zone  Yeah so  I can't fucking stand that  So Jimmy  He's trying to get  The group shot today  Yeah I don't see it happening  That was the best part  Of the fucking comedy tour  That we were doing  We could walk anywhere  It was weird right  It was so cool  I kept waiting  For someone to stop me  Right yeah  It's like no  See our fucking names 
[01:39:00]  Are up there  We can go anywhere  Fucker  Yeah  And then any other event  I always feel like  Alright this is coming to an end  I'm getting thrown out  I always tell people  I go just walk  Like you know where you're going  Right  If you have a guilty look  On your face  You're dead  Hey where are you going  Keep walking  Yeah keep walking  Like you just  You've been there  A million times  Follow me  Every  I escort like five people  If I have an all access  I go just fucking  Get behind me  And just keep looking 
[01:39:30]  Straight ahead  I'll take care of it  You're the snow plow  Just fucking  Yeah absolutely  And then the guy's like  Wait a minute  All access  You can't  What they don't have  When I go  I work for the band  Sorry  And I do  I do when the music's really loud  So they can't argue with you  Uh huh  You know  Just the usher  That's fucking like 21  He's in college  And they got him standing  And I'm like dude  And you just keep pointing  But no  I'm going over there  And you just go like this  He's not going to out  Yell the band  And then he's just like  Alright I can't fucking deal  With this guy  In 2005  We were fucking backstage  At Tweeter Center  We were trying to get  Sabbath pictures 
[01:40:00]  And we were watching Bill  Warm up on his drum riser  And we kept being afraid  We were going to get thrown out  So every time somebody  Walked by  We would just talk  Like we knew  What we were doing  We were supposed to bring this earlier  But they didn't bring it  We just kept jumping  We were just staring at Bill Ward  Yeah our buddy Jason Bittner  Who's a drummer in Shadows Fall  Knew Bill  So he goes alright  Just wait here  And Bill warmed up  For like 45 minutes  And we're just staring at him  It's like 3 in the afternoon  That's pretty cool  I'm like alright  We're definitely getting  Thrown out of here 
[01:40:30]  Cause like who are these two creeps  We wanted Bill Ward pictures  So fucking  Bill was all unshaven  And just relaxed  And he was so nice  But every time someone came by  We didn't want to seem like fans  So like  I don't know  The guy was going to come back  But he never did  That's another good thing  Is when somebody puts you somewhere  And goes alright  Just stay here  I'll be right back  And then you're just lost there  And someone asks you  It's like  What are you doing back here  Well fucking  My buddy Bob  He's the guy that  I don't know who the fuck  You're talking about  You can't stay here  No but I was told  Come on move  And you're like  Ah this fucking sucks 
[01:41:00]  It's too stressful  But the guy tells you  It's cool  You'll be fine  Just stand here  It's never cool  Fuck that  Next thing you know  You find the one door  You didn't know existed  Yeah yeah  And you're in an alley somewhere  What happened  I'm out of the whole venue  Yeah now I can't even see the show  But it broke some rule  What we used to do is  We get like four guys  I'd have a ticket  Like in the 10th row  So I get all the way down  To the bottom  And I have like three guys  Behind me  That didn't have tickets there  They were up on the lawn  They had lawn seats  So I'd go there 
[01:41:30]  When the band was on  When it was super loud  And I'd go to the guy  Like the one usher  And I'd be showing him my ticket  And he'd point  Okay it's right over there  I go no  But what is this  He goes what are you talking  I go I'm supposed to be over here  Or not there  I just keep pointing  And causing mass confusion  And I'm pointing at the guy  I go but what if  And as soon as he turns his head  My three friends just whiz by  Like a hundred miles an hour  And he's looking at them  Like they're gone  But I'm like  But where is this  He goes it's right there  And they're already mixing  Into the crowd  Fucking fake them out  Every time  You just gave a good tip 
[01:42:00]  You're a pro  That's beautiful  I went to a San Francisco Giant game one time  I'm a big Giant fan  So all the rushers  Are like 80 years old  They hire old people  To check the tickets  Me and my brother  My nephews  Get down to the third row  Right behind the dugout  We sneak pot  It's this old woman  As soon as she's distracted  We blow by her  She can't stop us  But now it's only the third day  And we still want to get beers and food  So like how do I get back out of here  I don't have a ticket  I might get busted  So I go back up to her  I go listen  I go  My friends are a bunch of alcoholics  And I'm going to get some food 
[01:42:30]  But I'm not going to be able to show you my ticket  Because I got  I'm going to take like six beers back  And I won't be able to go in my pocket  So will you remember me when I come back  She goes  Okay yeah I'll remember me  I go  I look like Brad Pitt don't I  And she's like  Oh I wouldn't say that  I'm like come on  How about from this angle  She's like  Oh no I don't think so  Yeah maybe a little  I go okay  So you remember Brad Pitt right  She goes of course  Okay Brad  Oh man  Come back with eight beers  There you go Brad  Yeah hi Brad  Walk right by  Beautiful  Oh man that's a good one 
[01:43:00]  Yes  Oh that's brilliant  Because I tell people  If I'm going to sneak you down to the front row  You can't take a piss the rest of the day  Yeah that's it  Or just do it in the cup  Which my friend  I took him to Sabbath  You know Tony  Crazy Tony  We're in like the 10th row  I mean they probably pay like 350 bucks for the seats to be in 10th row  And he fucking  He just takes his dick out and pisses  At the PNC Art Center  He's pissing  While the band's on  He pulls his shorts to the side  And usually you use a cup  Out of respect  You piss in an empty beer cup 
[01:43:30]  Sure  Nobody's looking  You do it on a song  You don't do it on a bad song  You do it on like War Pigs  Where everybody's looking at the stage  And you whiz right in the cup  No problem  You put it down by your feet  You're good to go  And then someone tips that over  Well always yeah  And then if someone has sandals on  It's even better  It's all over their feet  It's always best to put it on the ground  And then give it the slight kick it over yourself  Yep  So you don't get  It doesn't splash when it's kicked  And maybe get on you  So you do that  But I've seen people  That just blatantly piss like that  And it's splashing like a horse piss 
[01:44:00]  All over everyone's fucking shins  And oh it's disgusting  Well that's what my friend did  These two big guys are in front of him  It's the first song  And he's pissing  And it's splashing on their back  At a friggin  Their ankles  Yeah on their ankles  Because they've got shorts on  It's friggin 100 degrees  And these guys are turning around  And he pulled it back real quick  He's a professional  And they're like  And they're trying to look  But it's dark  And they're trying to look for the piss  But they can't see it  And they're just staring at him  I go did you just piss  He's like yep  And he keeps headbanging 
[01:44:30]  Like yeah  And these guys will keep turning around  And they're ready to punch him in the face  So I'm like oh  The first three songs  They couldn't figure out  If he did it or not  They were 90% sure  So I moved them over  I go get on this side of me  So I moved them over  Like three people  Just so they wouldn't punch him in the face  And at one point  All the lights came on  And they're like  Look for the piss  And they were all looking around  But the whole floor was wet  Right right  And it dried up on their seats  That he pissed on  So they just let it go  But I go  You ruined the first four songs  Because I just  I'm going to have to fight these guys 
[01:45:00]  I was standing like  Four fucking  Four fucking seats over  Going this is going to be  A fucking major  You saw it right  Of course I did  It was bad  You would get beat up for  Him I wouldn't  Jim I'd get beat up for  But I mean  There's no  I'm like  I told him later  I go  Those guys paid like $700  Total for those two seats  And you pissed on them  You pissed on them  We got a guy  That wants to apologize  To you Florentine  Mickey on Long Island  Mickey  Jim what's up man 
[01:45:30]  What's going on  Yeah I've got to apologize  I was sitting in front of you  At the concert  I kept calling you DeRosa  What  He got a picture with you  Oh  Call me DeRosa  Yeah  Alright  I don't even remember that  But that's alright  Look I was with  I was with my wife  Who's hot  Not a tranny  So I don't know why  You would say DeRosa  I got a picture with you guys  You guys are all awesome  Alright  That's the apology  Alright  It happens  All awesome  Thank you sir  We're going to play another  Another song from the Apollo show

[01:46:30]  At Giant Stadium  While 120,000 people  Are trying to fucking get back to  New York City  I wanted time to grab some dinner  New York City  After the show  I wanted like to go to a restaurant  And to leave  It would have been an hour  To get a cab  And stuff like that  So I  Yeah I bolted after the first encore  And grabbed a cab  In two seconds  I was out of there  You know  It's worth it  He missed battery  In Seek and Destroy  That's it  I missed Seek and Destroy  Which sucks  I didn't mind missing battery so much  But yeah  What are you going to do  I get it  If Jim left a Sabbath concert 
[01:47:00]  Because he wanted to beat the traffic  There'd be no excuse for that  Right right right  You know he's like  Nah I didn't want to wait  At the Meadowlands for that  You know then  But if you're not a huge  Hardcore fan  Super  Then it's like alright  You saw  I mean it was a long show  Yeah  So you saw it two hours  I saw a fuckload of Metallica  From you know  Right here  It was awesome  I wouldn't leave a Sabbath show  Really to catch a flight  Oh Jimmy  I wouldn't leave a Sabbath show  Really for anything  No  No  No  Alright well  We're going to play Seek and Destroy  We got Florentine in today  Jim you promoting anything

[01:55:00]  Talaga loves you, New York City!  The The O.P. and Anthony Show  on Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Yeah, this is The O.P. and Anthony Show 
[01:55:30]  We're all noticing it's ramping up.  If you're just tuning in, Jim Norton really wants a picture with Metallica today.  We got one the other night, but James Hetfield was having barbecue.  I was at the barbecue place. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, you saw him there?  Yeah, he came over and said hello.  He knows you personally at this point?  He knows me from the show, but Brian Slagle, who originally signed them from Metal Blade Records,  I was hanging with him.  Are you still around with the band?  Brian's got his own label.  He was the first one to put a Metallica song out years ago.  Is he still connected with Metallica?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We sent him over to the table because he was eating.  I go, Brian, go over there and see if James will come over to our table.  And he went over and said hello.  He goes, he's eating right now, but he might.  And then he came over about 15 minutes later. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Said hello and all that stuff.  Were people just staring at him at the place?  No, because he just kind of mixed.  He fit right in with everybody.  There wasn't too many Metallica fans there.  That barbecue place is unbelievable.  That was the best barbecue I've ever had in my life.  Is it a legendary place?  Oh, yeah.  Amazing.  Yeah, they do well over there.  Yeah.  Holy shit, you've got to try to play.  Is it a long line?  No, not at all.  No, you get in and out.  He's so recognizable to even casual fans. 
[01:57:00]  It's like, oh, that's fucking James Hetfield.  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, there was a few people hanging around, but he didn't come in with a big security.  He had a couple of buddies with him, photographers and stuff.  But no one bothered him.  But he did come over to the table, which is great.  Man, that is.  Yeah, look at that.  But this is about Jimmy in the picture.  Oh.  So there's an opportunity to get a picture with the whole band, which Jimmy really wants.  Yeah.  And we've noticed that it's starting to ramp up.  Well, the reason.  The frustration.  The reason it's frustrating is because.  Ramp up.  This is what I said. 
[01:57:30]  Do you understand that I was with, when I heard Metallica was playing at the Apollo.  Right.  I was, they offered me a Tonight Show shoot.  And I told my manager at first, turn down the Tonight Show shoot.  Wow.  I can't do it.  I'm going to this show.  And then I'm like, I realized you can't do that.  You're a psychopath.  Like, you can't put a fucking show before your career.  But it's not even put a show.  It's a picture.  The picture was more important than the show as far as the Tonight Show.  Well, at that point, they didn't know.  Yeah.  I mean, at that point, I wasn't sure if there would be a meet and greet. 
[01:58:00]  But I'm like, I may be.  But then it turned out the Tonight Show canceled.  So I was like, okay.  I was lucky there.  Right.  But I was tempted to.  But then I was like, I can't do it.  That's crazy.  So we go to the meet and greet.  And again, Sirius was amazing.  They fucking got us in.  And it was just one of those things where James was out kind of exploring the city  and just didn't make the meet and greet.  And that's when me and Ant looked at each other and went, oh, oh, oh.  So you guys know it.  Of course.  We all know.  But I knew before the show that it wouldn't happen.  I knew before we went up there.  Did you really?  I was told before there's only going to be three of them there. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  But you were hoping, ah, maybe they're wrong.  Yeah.  You never know.  But I didn't know if it would be James or Robert or Lars.  So now they're going to be here.  They're doing Howard.  Who, you know, we don't really have a, we don't, it's not even a negative thing.  We just, you know, they have their thing.  We get our thing.  So there's no way to go over and ask anybody, hey, could I, because they're not going to  accommodate me.  So what do you do?  Knock on his door.  Hello.  If you wouldn't get me fired, I would do it.  I want to get you fired.  Knock on the door and go, hey, man, is there anyone I could talk to while they're playing  a song? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  No, just on the outside door.  Just knock.  Bust in when they're on the air.  Hey, they probably have a doorbell over there.  Ring the doorbell.  It's the doorbell.  It comes to the front of the Howard section of the floor.  Yeah.  And then, you know, just ask nicely.  Your best way right now is when they're coming out in the lobby, you'll be there and jump  right in.  So that's, that's your only shot.  You're not going to get in that side of the building.  It's going to be a manhouse out there, though.  I don't think so.  They're going to have security people. 
[01:59:30]  And I think they're going to take a few group shots.  They're going to take a few group shots.  Because there's somebody around here of importance that they're going to account.  Sirius is going to want them to, even though they took it in front of that, the sign at  Apollo, they're going to want to do it here, too.  But that's just it, too.  Because unless they're doing group shots, what are you going to do?  Walk up to all of them and go, guys, guys, come on, get together here.  I need a picture with all of you.  If I could speak to one of them, if I could speak to Kirk, I would say, look, James wasn't  at the meet and greet.  It's like, you guys are impossible to get as a band. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I, um, no, we, you know, we can't.  Oh, God.  Jimmy just standing there.  Asking a band member is sometimes easier.  I told you, I got sad because I asked Tony to stop Ozzy because he was walking out.  Right.  Where are we at, though?  Are you making phone calls, texting people?  What's up?  What's the update?  What's the update?  It's just, there's no update.  Like, I know it's not going to happen.  I know it's, like, I feel it.  I, I honestly do feel it.  It's like, I know the energy on these things and it's fucking, you feel the push kind of  going a certain way.  Will you be all right if it doesn't happen?  I'll be, of course. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, I'm lucky I got to see them.  I've met them.  It's not like, you know, it's the end of the world.  It's just, ah, fuck, it was that close.  Can you Photoshop James in that picture?  You had that picture, the old picture with him.  Nobody's going to know.  But I'd be so bummed if it was Robert Trujillo who wasn't there, I'd be bummed.  Or Laura, any of them.  Right.  It's just one of those things, it's a really hard thing to get.  It's a really fucking hard thing to get.  And it's like, fuck, man.  86, by the way, was that show.  Not 85.  It was 86. 
[02:01:00]  What show?  Oh, the Aussie show, yeah.  What about Brewer?  Jim's tight with James.  Yeah, that's true.  Did you work that angle?  No, we asked him, I can't call Brewer, could he ask you anything?  Could he stop in the hallway?  Yeah, no, I can't do that.  You're desperate, you know what I mean?  You've got to throw it out.  We're so bad, we're like, God.  The only reason I told him earlier, I'm just poking at you, because it's just too much  fun on the radio show.  I'm texting our agent, because he's suffering inside.  Oh my God.  Because the only way to do this is to go through the agency, through the management, because 
[02:01:30]  I can't do it through Howard's show.  And it's frustrating, because these are the guys, like my guy, Pete, doesn't really deal  with them as much as these other two guys in the office do, who've been dealing with  them for 20 years.  And it's like, what you've got to do is, hey, who's going to be with so-and-so?  Oh, we've got a client who wants to take a picture with the band when they're done.  It's like literally that simple, and it's not...  Why isn't that being done?  Would there work...  Who knows?  I mean, I don't know how these communication...  I just know, for me, on a very low level as a comic, how I do things, but it's different  than a fucking band that does, you know, stadiums. 
[02:02:00]  I understand that.  Call Pete live on our show right now.  No, because he's actually on a bus.  He wouldn't pick up the phone.  I know where he is right now.  He's on a bus.  He won't pick up if he's in his office at his desk.  He's not picking up.  No, why?  Because he's...  Why?  Oh, man.  Is there some avoidance going on right now?  No, I mean, he just knows that it's like, look, there's only so much he could do.  I think if he was here to facilitate it, he could possibly pull it off where he's standing 
[02:02:30]  out there and go, hey, you guys real quick, but he can't.  He's on a bus, and there's a whole lot of red tape to go through.  I'm telling you, your best shot is be out there.  Get a three-minute notice when they're almost done and stand out there.  They're going to take pictures and just jump in.  Hey, I'm from Ozzy's Boneyard.  You know, they love...  One thing about Metallica, they love any people that promote metal.  They'll always respect that, and they'll always go out of your way for you.  So if you throw that angle in there, they'll probably know who you are.  I love metal.  But, hey, I do a show at Ozzy's Boneyard every night. 
[02:03:00]  You know, I play you guys all the time.  I love to get a quick picture.  This is where I completely agree with Jimmy, though.  Some of these things that should be so fucking simple, there's always so...  Yeah, why?  ...complication, and it's like, why is there so much red tape and bullshit?  You know?  They're here.  There's no one else really around.  We're fabulous.  It should be like a no-brainer.  You know, look, everybody has to justify their job.  You're right.  That's working with them.  Not necessarily them.  That's it.  I'm not using them as an example.  But anybody. 
[02:03:30]  You know, the publicist, and then this one, no, this...  You know, and it never gets to the band, and then they're gone.  And here's the other side of it.  We're so pathetic.  I'm just hanging around with the apologists waiting for people to ask me for a picture.  Right.  I didn't realize you could get to a level where you could make it all complicated shit.  Yeah, it's fucking frustrating, man.  It is frustrating.  It's so stupid.  But I know the energy of these things.  I mean, I'm not...  It's not like he's out in Times Square, where if he stops and takes a picture now, ah, fuck,  these guys are going to never be taking pictures for the next two and a half hours. 
[02:04:00]  We're talking...  It would be seconds.  Seconds added on to their day.  It's literally 30 seconds.  Not even, but whatever.  Jimmy, whatever.  I'll tell you, though, my 14-year-old nephew went to the Sabbath show in Jersey, and I  was talking to Sharon before, and he was talking to her, and she was so excited that he was  a huge fan of being a 14-year-old kid.  After the show, Ozzy jumped in his SUV, and we were saying goodbye to Sharon, and Sharon's  like, Ozzy, get out of the car. 
[02:04:30]  Get out.  He's like, what?  He's like, get out.  Get out.  You have to take a picture.  And she made Ozzy get out of the car after the show and take a picture with my nephew.  That's pretty cool.  You know what I mean?  And that was like, she just said, look, just do this.  This guy, you know, whatever.  He works on our channel, doing all his stuff, and just, you know, takes two seconds out of  your life.  She went out of her way to do it.  Yeah, we got everyone for him that night.  We got...  It's pretty cool.  Fucking, uh...  So, I mean, we had to go through...  If we tried to go through the publicist of Black Sabbath, then a manager, then two Ozzy 
[02:05:00]  handlers, it would have never happened.  Right to Sharon, right there.  She pulled her husband out.  Organically, it happened.  You know what I mean?  I have a good feeling.  All right.  What...  If it does happen, you get the whole band.  Can you do something nice for somebody?  Well, we got to get past the fact that it might not be a good picture after that.  We got that stage.  Yeah, what if you get the one and it's blurry?  What if it goes straight?  I got a Charlie Hefton picture, yeah.  And if it's blurry.  I got scolded, because what was it?  The flash in your Rob Zombie picture? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, but I didn't scold you.  It was just a bounce off the thing.  I just popped it up for the show.  Jimmy was blown out, because...  Wait, have you worked it out?  Who's going to take the picture if this goes down?  No.  And what camera?  I got my camera.  I've been carrying my fucking camera in my back pocket.  Hopefully, there'll be somebody out there, but I'll have my camera, too.  And I'll just hand it to anybody and just say, snap it.  And I'll, you know, believe me, it'll be ready.  There's a lot of stages here.  I'll bring Kenny out there with me.  Then the picture has to be good after that.  It'll be okay.  I have faith that the picture's taken.  Can I do something nice for somebody?  Yeah, I mean, I'd... 
[02:06:00]  I know, I'm just joking.  I would jerk somebody off into my hand.  You know what's another good move?  I saw someone do this, is you give Kenny your iPhone and your camera,  and he takes two at the same time.  Clicks both like that.  Not too much.  Too crazy.  No, but because then one's not good.  Shake it out.  You're going to get a shit.  Yeah, but you know what?  You got two there.  This camera's better.  The one I got here is a good fucking camera.  I know, but maybe the light's not on, or maybe it's better if it's dark.  It's like two pistols, one in each hand.  Do you do it that way?  Or do you concentrate with one pistol with two hands and really aim?  No, the fucking button. 
[02:06:30]  Kenny looking for the button with his big dry hands.  Oh, God.  He'd break the phone and poke his finger through.  My phone takes good pictures.  You could use my phone.  All right, well, if I go out there, too, I'll use your phone.  Kenny gets it on your camera.  So you got a backup.  But then the eyes aren't looking in the right place.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't be picking at that point.  No, Jimmy, don't like that.  You could fix them in fucking Photoshop.  That's why I always hate when there's two cameras pointing at a group.  I know, I know.  I always yell, like, no, that one first, because no one knows where to look.  If I'm the one taking the picture, if they want the picture with me, if it's a couple of fans, 
[02:07:00]  I'll actually say, look at the girl in the pink.  Okay, everybody, my arms are actually out, and I'm method acting.  Look at the girl in the red.  I'll actually tell the fucking people I'm with where it looks, and I don't have a douchey picture.  I met John Mellencamp.  He's dating Meg Ryan.  I don't know if he still is, at the Rock Roll Hall of Fame like a year and a half ago,  and they weren't even looking at me.  I just stood next to them, and they weren't taking any pictures, and I just said,  just snap it.  He's like, do not look it.  Just snap it.  And they're looking that way, and I'm just standing there with a big grin on my face.  It's a great picture.  Because you like getting pictures, too. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I do.  Especially Mellencamp and Meg Ryan.  That's a good one.  Not like Jimmy, but you're pretty close, though.  Florentine got me on this fucking kick in 97.  I know.  I started this shit.  We got to blame you.  Fucking Florentine.  I did.  Get the picture.  Get the picture.  We were fucking Aussie, and I was only going to get an autograph back then.  Oh, my God.  And the picture came out so beautiful, it became a lifelong obsession.  Yeah, I know.  And you've been chasing that hit ever since.  That first hit is always the good hit.  The good picture.  You've been chasing that ever since.  And now my nephew, I bring him to all the shows, so now he's into it. 
[02:08:00]  I got him into it, so now it's like every band I know.  Well, now I know why bands don't want to do this.  I got to bring him on the bus.  I got to go, yeah, yeah, yeah, jeez, jeez, jeez, and then I'm like, hey, my nephew.  But one thing about bands, when they see a young kid, they'll always go out of the way for him.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's 14, so they're like, all right, they'll get a guy out of his bunk on the bus,  go, hey, you got to take a picture with this kid.  The new fans, the up-and-coming fans, they need those.  But now I use him.  If I don't have a picture, I go, you know what, I might as well get one, too.  Might as well.  Yeah, since he got one, why you already got the guy out of the bunk. 
[02:08:30]  I would tip somebody out of their wheelchair to take a picture.  Jimmy, we're getting a great tip coming in, for real.  For real.  No.  Sean in California.  Sean.  Yes, sir.  This is why the Android and Samsung are such a great phone.  So, with the Samsung device, you can actually just record the whole event, and then as you're recording, it's actually taking, like, still images.  So, when you're ready for the shot that you want, you just play back your video, you touch the screen, and you've got your perfect photo every time. 
[02:09:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, no, I've actually thought that.  It does work.  I've actually thought of that.  It does work that way.  No, I know.  Definitely.  The Samsung does a great job with that.  So, that's pretty, that's a pretty cool feature.  I've taken screenshots off my videos.  Everyone calm down.  No.  It's a special program.  No, only Samsung has this.  Screenshot.  It's been fine.  But Samsung has a special program.  Look at this moment I interrupted.  They do.  With fucking, uh, I'm showing Jim this picture.  With fucking Dio and Lemmy, we're having a nice moment at the Motorhead.  Oh, no, what did you do? 
[02:09:30]  30th anniversary.  Can you see that?  Oh.  Jimmy fucking just put his face in there.  Oh, you moment wrecker.  That's great.  I actually sent this one picture to Lemmy I got of him and, uh, wait, where is it?  Him and fucking Ronnie, uh, Huggins.  Is that a great shot?  Yeah, I didn't even ruin that one with my own face.  It was my own face.  I remember the Aussie picture I got from my nephew when Sharon got him out of the truck. 
[02:10:00]  I panicked because I took my nephew's phone and it was on record.  And I'm taking a picture and I'm like, it's not going, it's not going.  I'm like, I don't know what's going on.  I'm like, oh, it's on record.  And I have an iPhone.  I know how to work it.  And I was that fucking fan.  I was like, oh.  And I was almost dropping the phone because I was hitting wrong buttons because I'm like,  I'm now making Aussie wait.  He didn't want to be out here.  It was uncomfortable.  It seems like every second.  Yeah.  You were that guy.  Yeah, because he was doing the whole choke thing where he chokes him.  That's like Aussie's face.  It's a great picture when he chokes.  So he's holding on to my nephew's neck. 
[02:10:30]  And I'm like, oh, dude, why?  Wait, hold on.  Nephew's turning blue.  He's really squeezing.  Oh, man.  Well, good luck here, Jimmy.  We'll see how this works.  We'll see what happens.  We all know how it's going to work out.  And I'll live with it.  And I'll shut my fucking faggity mouth.  Never know at this point.  How important is this to you?  I just hope we don't get punched in the eye this time.  Like, what would you rather have?  A Cowboy Super Bowl win this year or the whole band picture right now?  I would rather have a picture.  I'd rather have a picture with you and Sam than a Cowboy Super Bowl win. 
[02:11:00]  Fuck them.  Yeah, I want a picture with the band badly.  More than anything.  I like to segue into football, though.  That's smart.  You're learning some radio shit.  Professional.  It's unbelievable because now we can talk football and it seems smooth.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  I saw what he was doing.  No, I was trying to think of how.  Because I know he was a big Cowboy fan, but you don't even like the Yankees anymore.  So you can't even do a sports reference there.  He's not really a Cowboys fan either.  I'm not even that big of a sports guy.  Except for UFC.  It's the only thing I really watch.  By the way, did you see the Jones? 
[02:11:30]  How good was it?  It's one of the best fights I've ever seen.  Really?  Wow, really?  I knew this would be a tough one because I was talking to somebody and they're like,  Ah, no, this is not a big fight for Jones.  And I'm like, you don't know this guy he's fighting.  Gustafson is a fucking brute.  He's a fast-handed brute.  Can you go the distance?  I don't even know.  If anyone didn't hear the UFC fighters here.  Oh, God.  That's impossible at this point.  The guy beat, Jones beat the guy on a decision.  It was, Jones' fucking face was swollen.  He was bleeding.  He said it's by far the toughest fight he's ever had. 
[02:12:00]  And he was losing the fight through a lot of it.  And then he wound up coming back.  I think the last two rounds, his win, he's just a champion.  This Gustafson is a motherfucker.  Chump one.  And he took Jones down for the first time in his career.  It was an amazing...  Really?  Jones has never been fucking taken down.  And Jones, it took him, out of 11 times of trying to take this guy down, he took him  down once.  And that was Saturday while we were at Metallica.  Yeah, so I watched it when I got home.  I couldn't believe how fucking... 
[02:12:30]  This guy was just fucking jabbing him to death.  And Jones was kicking him.  It was such a great fight, man.  Brutal and bloody.  I'm going to have to search it out, even though I know who won.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Like a good, brutal, bloody fight.  Oh, it was just fucking good, man.  Florentine, so what's up with the NFL stopping games?  I don't know.  Was it because of the lightning, or was it...  It couldn't have been because of rain.  Well, lightning in the area and rain.  Yeah, they've done three games so far in the first two weeks.  Who knows what's going to happen tonight? 
[02:13:00]  I don't know if the game's in.  It's ridiculous.  We've seen a lot of bad weather football games.  Has anyone ever been hit by lightning?  No, never.  Okay.  Never in an NFL game.  What the fuck is this about?  It's never hit a stadium where fucking 20,000 people died because they were sitting in aluminum  seats.  They had a fucking beer in their hand and the lightning hit it.  It never happened.  So what's different this year?  I don't know what's going on because you've got a former lawyer running the league, Roger Goodell.  So he's afraid of getting sued by everybody.  He doesn't give a shit about the fans.  The fans can sit in the fucking...  He doesn't tell the fans, go back in your car or go get a bunker under the stadium. 
[02:13:30]  You could sit there, but we've got to get the players off the field.  Oh, wow.  Great point.  Yeah.  He doesn't give a shit.  He's like, oh, well, you bought a ticket to a live event.  You're not emptying the stadium.  You're just getting your players off the field.  You're just getting the players off the field.  Because there's lightning in the area.  That must feel...  The fan must feel good just standing there.  They don't give a shit.  They can't care less about that.  We need to see if they're going to come back on the field.  How about they put a lightning rod on top of the fucking stadium?  Doesn't that work?  I think they do.  Or give everyone rubber shoes. 
[02:14:00]  No one's dying in planes.  It's different.  Yeah.  You're not grounded.  Yes, I am.  I have a good base.  But, yeah, it's...  But, you know, 45 minutes, an hour.  You know, didn't you know the weather was going to be bad?  Why don't you just delay the game from the beginning end?  Or just cancel it.  Right.  But, obviously, there's too much money.  But don't fucking let the 75,000 people sit there and go,  we've got to take the players off the field because there's lightning in the area.  I used to watch those NFL films. 
[02:14:30]  And it was, you know, these gladiators of the gridiron.  And it's snowing.  You can't even see mud, rain, fucking...  They'd play through anything.  And then you'd be laughing at, like, baseball.  Go, look at these pussies.  I know, yeah.  They've got to put the tarp out.  Yeah, yeah.  They cover the field up and run into the dugout.  And football is always like, they'll play in fucking anything.  Just now, yeah.  Three games already.  Put a dome over every stadium.  I mean, that's what they're going to have to do.  They started that shit because they didn't want to deal with the, you know, 
[02:15:00]  the cold and the fucking rain and the snow.  They wanted their Super Bowl chances.  Oh, man.  It's great to see that shit.  What's next, though?  You know, it's windy.  They're like, oh, you know, we've got to take them off the field.  Yeah.  What about...  It's too sunny.  It's too hot.  Oh, we can't have them having these, bro.  Maybe we should have...  You know, are they going to make all the NFL...  They're just afraid of getting sued.  They just got sued with the lawsuits.  They've got to pay like a billion dollars out, which they got off light.  Way light.  With the concussions.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't even a billion, was it?  For years, these guys were getting fucked up on the concussions.  It wasn't even a billion. 
[02:15:30]  It was 785 plus lawyer fees.  Okay.  It averaged out to 170,000 a person that were under this lawsuit, the guys that got messed up.  Now, what...  So they only got 170,000?  Paid out over 20 years.  Uh-huh.  Jesus.  They got fucked.  What were they supposed to do, though?  What was the NFL supposed to do to prevent it?  And what have they changed now?  I work for the NFL.  Let me talk.  Jesus.  Jesus, what happened?  All right, Mr. Derek.  You work for the NFL.  Who are you? 
[02:16:00]  All right, I used to.  I worked in the NFL for five years.  As what?  No, we're not doing that part.  I'm not going to give you guys my fucking role.  But I managed a stadium for five years in the NFL.  Okay, fair enough.  All right.  So my position there was I was day-to-day operation, everything in the building, top to bottom.  Our structure got hit by lightning numerous times throughout the year.  If we have a fucking game going on with 80,000 fans in the seats, someone's going to fucking die. 
[02:16:30]  It's not about a lawsuit.  It's about fucking protecting people's lives, too, man.  You're going to have someone die in the middle of a fucking game.  How many people have been killed by lightning strikes in ballparks?  We clear the bowls during thunderstorms.  People aren't in the seats when we have a storm going over.  We have weather monitors all over the building.  If a lightning strike hits within 20 miles, we get a signal.  When it's within 15 miles...  Over the years, wait, wait, wait.  Years ago, there wasn't all this equipment.  There were lightning storms. 
[02:17:00]  How many people have been in Major League...  They were sitting on wood.  What?  They were sitting on wood.  I'm not talking about fucking 1800s after double day.  I'm fucking talking about...  When they used to wear leather helmets, too.  I'm talking about if you were sitting at fucking Shea Stadium years ago, or Giant Stadium even, years ago,  and a lightning storm came, and people were sitting in their seats and getting drenched by torrential rainfall,  how many people have been killed by lightning?  I'm sure there's data out there.  I don't have it.  I'm not going to give it to you.  So what are you saying that people will die? 
[02:17:30]  I've never heard of one case.  I think everyone would have known in a Packer friggin' Lion game in 72,  eight people got killed by lightning sitting in the top deck.  There are...  They put precautionary poles and lightning rods and stuff up around the perimeter of all these stadiums  to keep it as safe as possible.  I've never heard, never heard of people being killed by a lightning strike when you're sitting there watching a sporting event.  But what's Derek's point?  We had a fucking...  All right, let me put it...  My point is, you guys are talking out of your ass. 
[02:18:00]  I go, well, the NFL's scared of lawsuits.  They are.  Well, why now?  Why didn't they do it in the 70s and 80s, stop games?  They never really stopped games before.  Until a couple of years ago.  Because our fucking stadiums are 80 times larger than they were back then.  So they have a better chance of getting hit by lightning because they're a little bigger?  Yes, because there's nothing around them even taller.  They're built differently.  They're designed differently.  As opposed to, you know...  That's true, though.  That is true.  That's right, because there was no metal in Giant Stadium before I tore it down. 
[02:18:30]  It was all just cement and wood.  Of course.  I hate uneducated guys that just rant and go, you know what?  You're right.  Do you tell me there was no metal in any other stadium until a new stadium?  There's not new stadiums everywhere.  I'm not saying that.  I hate when assholes...  Like, Florentine, I love you, but you're fucking ranting about fantasy football and how you...  It's hilarious.  He's a comedian.  Oh, my God.  This guy...  Oh, my God.  This guy's right, though.  You probably played fantasy football, right?  It's insulting and irritating. 
[02:19:00]  Dude, it...  No, it's not...  It's not irritating.  Jim Florentine's whole fan base is in fantasy football leagues.  He's mocking him, and...  Oh, my...  It's just a funny bit.  Yeah, but he rants, though, without knowing.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Yeah, I mean, I don't...  Thank God.  I don't know that, you know, you're not supposed to bring your laptop to the sports bar.  I don't know that.  You're right.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  You got 17 screens in front of you, but, you know...  I don't know.  Dude, you're an idiot.  But, look, there's not...  Let me get one more word in.  One more word in.  No. 
[02:19:30]  No.  You said that because there's bigger stadiums now, there's more of a chance of a lightning storm.  How much bigger is the new fucking MetLife Stadium in New Jersey than Giant Stadium?  Is it 17 million times?  The stadium's bigger?  Yeah.  Where it might get hit now?  Citi Field as opposed to Shea.  The old giant stadium.  Did it just...  Lightning kept hitting the park a lot?  Thank God this stadium isn't too big.  If it was a little bigger, it would have fucking hit, you know, the whole 304 section.  It was fucking nonsense.  It was missing it by eight feet. 
[02:20:00]  Eight feet.  Thank God.  Yeah, Derek, you fucking idiot.  Listen, listen.  What else?  It's a social thing as well.  It's a social thing as well.  Like, 30 years ago, kids were wearing helmets while riding bikes.  Bullshit like that.  People are more cautious about safety.  Just like leather helmets in the NFL.  Now we have...  No one's getting hit by lightning in ballpark.  But, Derek, you know what pushes us forward?  The safety shit.  It's one lawsuit happens.  And then...  And I know parents are different with their helmets. 
[02:20:30]  But, like, one fucking or two lawsuits happens.  And then everybody gets afraid.  Look at the sexual harassment shit.  That's all because a couple of big lawsuits happen.  Everybody gets afraid of losing.  State versus Jim Norton?  Yeah, absolutely.  And I told...  I said I was just joking when I grabbed your hips and fucking put my half-hard dick in her hiney.  I couldn't get a ride because I was nervous.  Look, that's definitely...  I'm not saying that's definitely not an influence on these rulings.  But you have to also keep into consideration if one person gets hit by lightning... 
[02:21:00]  Take into consideration, you fucking dolt.  Not keep into consideration.  You're an idiot.  My apologies.  My apologies.  That every new stadium should build bunkers underneath for when there's a lightning storm coming...  Right.  ...through your Doppler radar that 75,000 people go take cover until it's over.  If they're really worried about that.  75,000 people build a fucking bunker.  Yeah, Derek, I think Jim's point is that they're getting the players off the field...  They don't give a shit about the fans. 
[02:21:30]  ...but the fans are still sitting ducks if the lightning is actually hitting the stadiums like that.  No, that's what I'm trying to explain.  We fucking clear the seats and we get them inside.  I've never been...  You've never...  What fucking stadium in a rainstorm?  I've never been cleared out of a stadium in a rainstorm.  Yankee Stadium.  You just sit there and deal with it.  I've been cleared out of seats.  No, you haven't been.  Sir, sir.  No one...  Don't listen to Jimmy.  He's being a asshole.  No sporting event has told everybody to leave their seats.  I've never left a stadium because of rain.  They've never told us...  It doesn't happen. 
[02:22:00]  The NFL...  It's a fucking NFL rule.  All right.  When it's a lightning strike within 15 miles, you have to clear the seats.  Why am I...  When the fuck has that happened?  Yeah.  But I've never had it happen.  Give me one instance where everyone has been told to leave their seats.  It's announced, but it's not...  You can't enforce it, but it's announced.  I'm trying to think of the last time.  It was Browns versus Bengals, 97.  You...  It's not...  So they feel like if they announce it, then they're cool. 
[02:22:30]  Next time when they stop a game, right, and they go back to the announcers, another 30 minutes.  You should look at the crowd.  There's still 30,000, 40,000 people just sitting there waiting for the game to start.  They're not all in the friggin'...  Because they're fucking 80 beers drunk, just, like, jerking each other off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  And where are they supposed to go?  And then the ticket people have to fucking see them again.  Yeah, and you know why they're sitting there?  Because they go, there's never been anyone killed at a fucking stadium through lightning,  so I'm going to sit here and wait for the game to start again.  People get out of the rain because they want to get out of the fucking rain.  I've never been at a ballpark where they've told you...  I've never heard an announcement. 
[02:23:00]  Please leave.  There's lightning.  Leave.  People go to the upper decks and underneath the tier to keep dry, not because of lightning,  and then they come back to their seats later.  No one is told...  Could you imagine a stadium clearing out?  And then having to re-get everybody to their seats again with the tickets...  They don't leave the actual stadium.  They go into the concourse.  We keep them in the concourse, and then it's all clear.  They go back.  75,000 people in those concourses.  And then 75,000 people have to go find their seats again. 
[02:23:30]  You're a fucking lying sack of cunt.  Hold on.  Guys, you guys haven't told your opinions, and that's okay to have an opinion.  I hate how on the show you guys take your opinions, treat them as facts...  You're taking your call and treating it like facts, and it's utter bullshit.  Exactly.  I didn't fucking work for the leader for five years.  No, you didn't.  No, you fucking worked for nothing.  Exactly.  Whatever.  I still love you guys.  But, dude, everyone does that when they have a discussion.  You always say your opinion. 
[02:24:00]  Like, everyone knows that we don't work for the NFL.  Right.  So nobody listening who's reasonable thinks that we have fucking written the law.  They know we're just expressing what annoys us.  Right.  We're not coming under the supposition that, yes, we work for the NFL, and you should understand that.  It's full of shite.  Anthony, to answer your question, NFL games, the majority of the fan base enters within 30 minutes of kickoff.  The entryways and entrance points of every stadium is built to support over 45,000-plus people to enter the facility in 30 minutes. 
[02:24:30]  And I've never seen the seats clear.  I've never heard an announcement to clear out.  The announcements are made.  I've never heard one.  Maybe because they assume we're wearing rubber shoes.  Why have I never heard an announcement?  And I've been at stadiums when it's been raining.  I'm drunk.  You're passed out.  Orange team's the only guy that watches sports.  Orange team's the only guy that watches sports.  Jimmy Chesedos doesn't watch sports.  Opie plays Sudoku and watches his kids. 
[02:25:00]  And Anthony, you drink.  Yeah, that's my whole life.  That's my whole life.  See what you're doing?  See what you're doing?  See what you're doing?  See what you're doing?  See what you're making some strong opinions.  You're implying that I like fucking prostitutes.  I'm getting jerked off in like trance.  Yeah, what?  Yeah, and you're saying that I don't watch my kid.  I just watch sports.  Listen, if you say only 45,000 people can fit in those concourses, there's another 30,000.  Where do those other 30,000 go when the lightning comes?  Well, the lightning knows that they can't get underneath.  So they leave those people alone.  There's so, like I said earlier, with how the buildings are built to support 45,000 people 
[02:25:30]  entering and leaving, the ramps and stairways are also covered.  So that's where they go.  I mean, it's...  There's more of a chance of somebody fucking breaking their legs on the stairs than there  is of anyone getting hit by lightning.  Damn.  So as far as a...  It's not a solid proof.  We don't have fucking bunkers.  But it's better than sitting in a chair with lightning around you.  Why?  It's not better because no one's ever been hit by lightning in a fucking stadium.  We go back to the...  Let's go back to the fucking... 
[02:26:00]  If I was at the giant stadium and I said, fuck it, I'm sitting there and I got hit by lightning  sitting in my seat and everybody else is in the Concord, I deserve it.  Right.  I'm like, you know what?  If I fucking get hit and die, I deserve it.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a good chance of not getting hit.  No one has told us to leave.  No one has told us to leave.  I've never heard that announcement ever.  If the NFL's so concerned about the fans and everybody getting hit by lightning, they know  that lightning's coming between 2 and 3.30, then tell people to stay home.  Say, we're not going to start the game until 4 o'clock.  Don't come to the stadium. 
[02:26:30]  Don't fucking pour shit when everybody's in there and then...  That's a terrible idea.  Why is that a terrible idea if you're so concerned about someone getting hit by lightning?  You can't predict a lightning strike two hours per second.  You got fucking your Doppler radar on your phone.  You know when it's coming in.  Everybody's fucking looking at the red here.  It's coming through between 1.15 and 1.40.  Who gives a fuck?  Are you tired of Doppler radar?  Yes, it's ridiculous.  It's dumb.  I have it on my phone.  Yeah, I know.  And everybody's wrong.  You know, you hear about getting big thunderstorms at 6 o'clock tonight. 
[02:27:00]  So what?  I got a fucking roof over my house.  I don't live in a tree fort.  If I want to get in my car, I got fucking windshield wipers and I got decent tires.  Or I'm not going to spin out.  And I got a fucking umbrella if I need to walk to the mailbox.  It's okay.  It's fucking okay.  I think people panic when they're Doppler.  Yeah, panic.  Yeah.  There's going to be a big storm coming around 6.  So what?  Oh, shit.  Anything else, Derek?  You made some good points today. 
[02:27:30]  Did he?  Yes, you did.  Derek is an adult.  What did you actually do?  What was your position, though?  So I was stadium manager, so I oversaw all...  You were assistant to the assistant manager at a movie theater.  No, so I oversaw all events at our building.  Oh, God.  So you're calling from Philly, so it's Philly, right?  No, I moved here recently for a career change.  From where?  What are you doing now?  I'm working in their stadium here now at the Wells Fargo Center.  I'm doing the same operation, but indoors. 
[02:28:00]  It has nothing to do with engineering or...  He's now indoors because he was so scared of the lights.  He was so scared.  This guy's just petrified of lightning.  Clear the people out!  He's running around warning them.  He can't even listen to Metallica do Ride the Lightning.  You know what he is?  That's too close to home.  Keep my warning!  He used to work in Minnesota at the Viking Stadium, but now they're going to an open-air stadium next year.  So he's like, I'm going to Philly.  I can't take this.  And he won't fly because of lighting, so he drove on sunny days from Minnesota. 
[02:28:30]  Ah, Derek.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  I hope we got some free tickets coming our way if you're in charge down there.  God damn.  All right.  There goes Derek and Philly.  He was so full of shit.  I mean, you can't clear out that many people for a lightning or a thunderstorm, whatever the fuck it is.  Ah, lightning.  Yeah.  What do you think of the Redskins?  Are they going to fucking fold and change their name? 
[02:29:00]  I don't think so.  I think that the owner, Daniel Snyder, says we're never changing the name.  So it's up to him.  But when he passes, then there'll be whoever takes over, and then I bet you they're the ones that go.  He's going to be there for a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully, he'll be there for at least another 10 years owning that team.  He's like a Jerry Jones.  He's not going to let that team go.  I think the point is you can look at any team name, and it's insulting to somebody.  Well, it's the commissioner that came out and said, look, if one person's offended by an NFL team name, we need to listen to them. 
[02:29:30]  When you start opening doors like that, then...  Well, that's what they do to these assholes with radio shows and everything else.  Right.  If one person's offended, then we need to listen to those people.  But fuck all the people that don't give a shit about it.  Yeah, of course.  Why don't they have a voice?  I do want to change the team.  That's one thing I actually agree with the PC people on is I think the Redskins should change it, and it's rare that I think that way, but it's not because it's just one person.  Well, what about Buffalo Bills?  The Buffalo Bill killed a lot of buffaloes.  It was very mean and very cruel to animals. 
[02:30:00]  They nearly wiped out the American buffaloes.  That's terrible.  They should change their name.  I think the difference is there's a lot of...  Minnesota Vikings, what did they do all the time?  Oh, my God, the Vikings were pillaging and raping.  Oh, yeah.  The Vikings were awful people, but the reason I agree with it is only because they have such balls.  Like, we're not changing the thing.  But if one of their fucking players utters something racist, they can't get out there and fucking grovel an apology fast enough.  It's almost like they would never fuck with Jews or blacks or fucking homosexuals. 
[02:30:30]  Like, if a player says fag in the locker room, they can't get out there fast enough.  But they can't get out there fast enough.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, the American Indians, I heard them explain themselves once on a talk show, and I've said this before, and they convinced me.  I was always like, fuck them, and then I listened to them, and they explained why it bothered them so much, and they weren't being irrational, and they weren't going, well, it's impolite.  Like, they actually had legit reasons, and I was like, ah. 
[02:31:00]  Well, what was legit reason for Redskins?  What they said was, to them, it means, and this is many years ago, I heard this.  It was about, like, that was a slur on Indians, but it was also how bodies in a cart were referred to, and they had, like, how many Redskins you got in there.  And that was part of it, and it just bothered them because it was a reference to that.  I didn't know you spoke hi-ya-ya-ya-ya.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was hard watching it as it rained in my living room.  Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya.  I have no idea you know how to speak that.  It just made sense to me when they explained it. 
[02:31:30]  But Vikings did terrible things.  Pirates?  What about the pirates?  But that's what I'm saying.  I'm not being radical about it and going, everything has to be polite.  It's just once in a while something happens, and it's like, okay, just because there's so much political correct nonsense,  it doesn't mean that everything that bothers someone is wrong.  What about St. John's?  But I think at this point, they just go, look, we're sorry.  The name's been there since 19, I don't know, 32 or something like that.  And they explained why they called them originally.  Why we called, and that's why we did it.  And, you know, we're sorry if you're offended. 
[02:32:00]  It's sorry if the times have changed where you're offended.  That's the name.  How about fucking St. Louis with all the mates and the boys?  And we respect you boycotting outside the stadium, not buying a red-skinned jersey, or even watching the NFL.  But it's a tradition, and it stands.  What about the Redmen, St. John's?  They changed the name to the Red Storm, right?  Well, college, they were all a bunch of pussies.  But that fucking storm we had last year was a motherfucker for a lot of people.  So I assume most people now will be offended by the Red Storm.  What about the Miami Hurricanes?  Oh, man. 
[02:32:30]  There's nothing fun about a hurricane, but they call their team the Hurricanes.  Yes.  Yes.  What about the Giants and the Titans for midget people?  Oh, that's true.  For midgets.  What if you have a midget friend, and you want to come over and watch the Giants and Titans?  What if we do?  He's Voss.  Yeah, what if I call Voss up and say, you want to come over to my house and watch the Giants and Titans?  Oh, it just reminds me how small I am.  Right.  Right.  I know why you did that.  Yes.  We're just all uptight now in society.  Yeah, in most cases. 
[02:33:00]  It's like the Giants, Anthony.  You know, like if they start taking away the, what's the, AR-15?  Yeah.  If they take that one away, that's what I was, then what are they going to go after next?  So if you take the Redskins name away, well, okay, so well, they did it for the Redskins.  Well, let's go after this thing.  The Chiefs in Arrowhead Stadium, I'm sure, is offensive.  I didn't do the research on that, but I'm sure there's a problem there.  They'll always be around.  They'll always try to keep going.  No one packs up their fucking little stationery and all the little shit that they send their complaints out to because they got one victory, and they go, well, we're done here. 
[02:33:30]  They go on to the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing.  But that's where people have to stop giving in.  When it's ridiculous.  I just don't think them, because again, when you, like, they would never cartoon the culture of another group.  They just wouldn't have the fucking, if the NFL had the balls to do that, and they said, you know what, we're going to show blacks, Jews, and they do have the fighting Irish.  Like, if they were doing it with everybody, I'd have no issue with it.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  But it's because they don't have, they lack the courage to do it everywhere else, and they can't get their fucking pants around their ankles and take a dick from any special interest group. 
[02:34:00]  But this one, which is probably legitimately the most offensive, then some player mumbling something in a locker room, and immediately they're like, you know, we're not doing it.  Just be, you know, that is what irritates me.  They're fucking selective.  I just missed the tomahawk, man.  Fuck.  Why do they have to take that away from us?  Do they take away the tomahawk chop?  Do they still do that?  Do they still do that?  I don't think so.  Yeah, we're not really allowed to do it anymore, man.  You look like a dick if you do it now.  You do the tomahawk chop?  Really? 
[02:34:30]  You look like a cock.  In Atlanta, the Braves, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Can't do it.  Braves do that?  Not cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a dumb thing.  I used to hate watching them fucking do it.  I hate that, too.  America's team on TBS.  Fucking remember when Ted Turner did that whole thing?  Well.  Tried to make the Atlanta Braves like, no.  Good for him, though.  If you don't like your local team, yeah, we'll just put that all over the country.  It was the first syndicated fucking sports team.  I hated the Braves.  Said how to be America's team.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, you got to see every fucking Braves game.  You're right.  Right?  You couldn't fucking find like the Mets or Yankees anywhere years ago. 
[02:35:00]  No, it's like, but goddamn, every fucking Braves game, he gives a shit.  I think we've talked about it over the years, but the celebrations in the NFL, how ridiculous  is that, that they don't let these guys do their shit?  Who cares if they do their shit after a good play?  Yeah, or even, you know, they catch a long pass and they just throw the ball in front  or taunt the guy, it's a 15-yard penalty.  If they go, ah, see, I beat you, ah, and just like walk away like that, it's a 15-yard penalty.  The other player's so insulted that he can't handle a guy spinning a ball after he got beat? 
[02:35:30]  You know what, put a limit, go, Luke, you got five seconds to do a celebration.  Anything after that.  Beautiful.  Anything, do whatever you want.  Anything after that.  Don't pull a magic marker out.  Like, I think Chad Johnson, and signed a ball or something, or he did something.  I forget.  If it's not, but if you want to dance for five seconds, just go do it.  And then the argument of it's really fucking up the game, not if it's only five seconds,  ten seconds or something.  Yeah, five seconds.  Even though I hate that, and I hate when, you know, they show that and everyone laughs.  You don't think it's funny when they do a dance?  My father-in-law laughs every time. 
[02:36:00]  There was a guy who did a dance last night, my father-in-law.  Did he get a good chuckle?  Yeah, he was chuckling at the guy, and I just looked at him, I go, don't do that.  I'm throwing you out of the house.  That's not funny.  You think it was funny?  No, just because a guy's dancing and he's being silly, that's not funny.  I've never stood on a dance floor and just go, I want to laugh, so I'm going to go to  a dance club and just watch people dance.  It's a fucking cheap, easy laugh.  But they should be allowed to do it.  They should be allowed to do it for five seconds.  We did the whole list of the things that the NFL was looking out for this year, and it was  ridiculous.  Were they allowed to spin the ball? 
[02:36:30]  No, they're not.  They're not allowed to spin the ball?  Why?  What does that hurt?  These guys are putting basically their lives on the line every weekend.  But they can't handle someone spinning a ball in their face after a good play?  And as a fan, you'll love that shit when they fucking rub it in.  It's the best thing.  And you can't, why don't they understand you're dealing with the mentality of people that like  doing that?  They're so competitive.  That's what makes them good at what they do.  You're almost trying to curtail their nature.  I hate sportsmanship in general. 
[02:37:00]  I really fucking hate it.  And then when you can't rub it in with the team because you're up 34-7, so you're not  allowed to throw any more passes.  So you worked on your offense all year.  Coaches are sleeping in their office, missing family, fucking ballerina dances because they're  trying to figure out a good plan.  And then you're up 34-7 in the third quarter.  We've got to hand it off because that's disrespectful for the team.  Fuck you.  And then if you're brave enough to keep your offense going, then the other team has a major  fucking problem with that.  Of course.  Belichick got shit for years. 
[02:37:30]  Remember that?  He's running up the scores.  Sorry.  We want to fucking practice our plays.  I'm not a big fan of Belichick, but I respect that.  I love that he does that.  I respect that.  Even if my team's down 62-0 in the second quarter, keep throwing bombs.  They deserve to lose 90-0.  But then the other side gets fucking pissed and they'll start fights and shit.  It's so mad.  Are you worried about the other guys fucking taking a late hit and fucking breaking the quarterback's  shin?  I mean, is part of it like they're worried that the other...  Then stop the game at that point.  No.  It's just a respect thing.  Have a mercy rule that it's there.  Just like in baseball, if you're up 7-0, the other team's not allowed to steal second 
[02:38:00]  base in the seventh inning because you shouldn't be doing that down 7-0.  That's bullshit.  Maybe the guy's trying to work on his stealing.  Absolutely.  For when it does matter down the, you know, at the end of the season, whatever.  Oh, it drives me insane.  They need to be humbled.  These guys can handle it.  The players can handle it, so I don't even know where it comes from.  That's what I'm saying.  They're professionals.  It's not like they're little kids.  They can handle it.  They don't give a fuck.  They're making millions.  Right.  Because they know they're going to have their shot to rub it right back in their face eventually. 
[02:38:30]  And that's what makes...  And then that's even cooler.  Eventually, it's going to come out where some guy's going to complain after a game that  he got bullied on the field.  Bullied.  By trash talking.  Yeah, yeah.  That his mom's a whore.  And she's, you know...  And she fucked me last night and my whole team and stuff like that.  Because, you know, she has five different kids from five different guys.  And they know the background.  Some guy's going to complain in a press conference.  And they're eventually going to start cutting down on that.  Dave, I read an article.  It was about...  What the fuck was it? 
[02:39:00]  High school.  High school football.  And said that there's all kinds of things in place now for language.  You can't...  If they catch you saying...  Saying fag or making some type of...  Like, I'll kick your ass or just anything derogatory toward the other team, you're out.  On the field, yeah.  You're out.  During a game, yeah.  It's crazy.  That's so stupid.  It is stupid.  It really is ridiculous.  I don't understand what they think it fixes. 
[02:39:30]  I think bullies get more bully-ish if they can't fucking throw out some...  Yeah, if they can't throw out some fucking epithets, they go right to punching.  You know?  Yeah.  Like bullies...  Well, fuck it.  We're going to get in trouble for calling you a faggot.  Yeah.  Might as well punch in the face.  If the bully wants to either call me a faggot or punch me in the face, I'll go with the  call me a faggot on the playground.  You know, and just because I got three dicks in my mouth doesn't mean I...  A faggot doesn't mean homosexual, remember. 
[02:40:00]  Well, back in those days, it...  You know, Patrick Harris kind of proved it a little bit last night.  He said something was gay.  He goes, that's too gay.  That's too gay.  To Fallon, right?  Oh, yeah.  Fallon was dancing.  And he goes, no, I ain't doing that.  That's gay.  That's too gay.  We're too gay.  Everybody laughs.  Yeah.  And if Ricky Gervais got up and did that at the Golden Globes...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's too gay across the world.  Oh, how could he say that?  Yeah, but...  Too gay.  That's implying that gay isn't...  He wasn't saying gay isn't sucked dick.  He was saying that's too gay.  But he was all right to say it. 
[02:40:30]  Because he's gay.  Everybody laughed.  All Hollywood laughed.  Oh, good one.  NPH.  They love laughing at some good stuff.  Well, they love the...  Gay jokes and whatnot.  They love the...  So Pacino at the NPH?  Is that Pacino?  Yeah, but he didn't win for Phil Spector.  I think he should have.  Michael Douglas.  Yeah, Michael Douglas was amazing.  You know what?  Michael Douglas was amazing.  That's the Liberace.  Bobby Cannavale won for fucking Warwick.  That was a huge surprise.  I was very happy.  I thought he was so good.  And Jeff Daniels won for Newsroom.  Yes.  Oh, man.  That was a huge surprise. 
[02:41:00]  I realized, too.  Yes, because everybody thought...  Cranston.  John O'Brien Cranston.  I should have.  They should have gave it to him.  They had to be too cool or something.  I don't know.  He'll have next year, though.  What was that speech everyone's talking about?  Which one?  I don't know.  He said it's the greatest acceptance speech ever.  Oh, just listen to it.  It's the first award given out.  I didn't see this.  And this is Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.  And some chick from Nurse Jackie won.  Yeah.  And it was a huge surprise to her and, I guess, everybody.  And so this is the greatest acceptance speech ever?  They're saying this is the greatest acceptance speech ever. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, because she had no idea that there was a possibility.  She didn't have anything written and nothing in her head.  She's got a one-in-five chance of getting it.  And she showed up there, wore a nice dress, and got her fucking hair done.  It's pretty safe to say I'll never win an Oscar, but I already know in my head where I would go with it.  Even if you're up against Pacino, De Niro, Johnny Depp, Nicholson, wouldn't you just say, there's no way I'm going to win, but I'd better.  You've got an idea of what you would say.  Right now, you've got an idea of what you'd say. 
[02:42:00]  Of course.  If someone handed you a fucking Oscar.  And I haven't even been casted for that Oscar movie yet.  That's a fucking great point.  Look at these idiots and go, ah, I don't know what happened.  I don't know what to say.  Ah, wow.  I should have written something down.  Shut up.  And the Emmy goes to Merritt Weaver, Nurse Jackie.  This is the first Emmy winner and second consecutive nomination for Merritt Weaver. 
[02:42:30]  She had her acting teams at LaGuardia Arts Public High School in New York City.  Oh, God.  Thank you so much.  Thanks so much.  Um, thank you so much.  Um, I gotta go.  Bye.  That's it, huh?  And she walked off.  That was hilarious. 
[02:43:00]  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  I gotta go.  But that's good, though.  At the moment.  Whatever.  I didn't mind it.  She didn't.  That was real.  Yeah, I'll accept that.  She just fucking had a panic attack.  You see Bob Newhart get a little choked up?  Did he?  Yeah.  Because he fucking won his first Emmy ever.  And I don't think he expected it.  Like, they, they, because the guy mentioned it.  Are you kidding me?  Mentioned Newhart.  He won his first Emmy.  And they fucking, an immediate standing ovation.  That was his first Emmy?  Ever.  Newhart never won an Emmy?  No.  Mm-mm.  Come on, you're lying.  No, I'm not. 
[02:43:30]  I was, they said on the thing.  That means he's got cancer.  That's crazy.  Wow.  Getting into the old man at the end of his career.  That always sucks.  Oh, dude, Jesus.  I just read, by the way, in this Carson book I'm reading, that Bob Newhart turned down The  Tonight Show.  That could have been his gig.  Before Carson?  Yep.  Carson.  Wow.  But then he might have blown it.  Yeah.  That's the other side of that shit.  Newhart goes in there and he has a real shitty year and then there's no Tonight Show for anyone.  Uh-huh.  It's not a guarantee he would have been Carson, right? 
[02:44:00]  No, that's true.  That's very true.  And Tony Bennett was on Johnny's first.  We had Tony Bennett.  I know, that's what I'm saying.  With Groucho and what an issue that guy is.  And met Groucho.  I never met Johnny.  I met Groucho.  Passed away.  Is he dead?  Yeah.  Is there any more Emmy clips we should play?  So, you know.  Do you have the Newhart clip of the guy saying that or no?  No.  Okay.  Are the girls talking about the Emmys today?  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of ball passing around about the Emmys.  They're throwing the ball around in there?  Yeah.  Did you get the clip where the seat filler guy walked up with the fucking, what show was 
[02:44:30]  it?  One of the shows won.  And the guy that was one of the seat fillers actually walked up on stage.  Because he just was like, got up and walked up with the crowd and then just stood up  there with one of the fucking awards.  It must have been a writing award or something.  And he just stood up there.  I guess they didn't know who he was.  And then they just kind of ushered him off stage.  That's crazy.  Wait, they ushered him off stage with the crowd?  Yeah, with the rest of them.  Oh, they didn't make him?  And you could see he was kind of confused.  He looked one way and then he looked the other way and walked off stage with him. 
[02:45:00]  But how do we know this?  It was on the news.  How fucking great is it?  I know.  It was fucking hilarious.  Most of the writers are never recognizable.  So, what?  The guy tweeted that I just did this?  Yeah, yeah.  He just like, you could tell he was completely out of place while he was up there, too.  Yeah.  Me and Jameson worked on HBO Inside the NFL one season.  We won an Emmy for like a best comedy segment.  It was the whole show. 
[02:45:30]  But we went to the sports Emmys and they wouldn't let us on stage.  They're like, no, if you guys win, we're just going to put, you know, like 20 guys instead of like 30.  They didn't want us up there.  We were wearing like Savage shirts.  Everybody was in fucking, you know, suits and tuxedos.  Who wouldn't let you up there?  People from HBO, like the higher ups.  Like it mattered.  Yeah, they go just, you know, these certain people.  Like Costas was there, Marino and Collinsworth, the people.  And then some producers and stuff.  But we had to stay back in the crowd.  But we got Emmys, actually.  That's pretty cool.  But you guys are in the fucking cut.  You guys are in the news.  No, they wouldn't, I know, but they didn't want us scumbags on the stage. 
[02:46:00]  Who cares?  Why don't you wear a suit?  For what?  We're going to a concert right after that.  Oh, the guy, yeah, they identified the guy.  His name was Kramer.  Oh, fuck.  Are you serious?  Did you get me again?  He got us both again.  Did you get me again?  Oh, I didn't know.  You really got me twice?  Kramer went up and accepted a Tony.  Cosmo Kramer.  He was a seat filler and accepted a Tony Award  for a play that Raquel Welch was in. 
[02:46:30]  And they wanted him to give it back.  And he said no.  And they said, okay, you can keep it.  But you've got to fire Raquel Welch.  Because she's a real cunt and would beat the shit out of these guys.  And they were afraid to fire her.  So he had to go in and fire her.  I'm on high alert after you got me Friday with the Seinfeld thing.  Because I believe that was the first one you got me with.  So when you went with the high school sports thing, that's when I thought.  Oh, you thought it was.  I'm like, all right, wait.  This might be the high school sports thing.  When he did the high school sports and the language.  But that was true.  That setup was so weird.  I'm like, I think he's going Seinfeld.  So you threw me off.  Because then I let my Seinfeld guard down. 
[02:47:00]  Yes, you did.  And he got me with the Emmy one.  Fuck.  A seat filler.  That's great.  It was great.  Kramer, like, he stood up to let the people out.  And then he just kind of got caught up in the crowd.  And he's standing up there nodding.  And they hand him an award.  That's fucking hilarious.  You got me so good.  I know.  Any other clips from the Emmys?  Not unless you want to see Neil Patrick Harris's.  He really decided to change things up this year.  And in the middle of the award show, he did his musical performance. 
[02:47:30]  Was that with the choreographer?  Is it too visual?  Oh.  Was it gay?  They did a, yeah.  But they did one thing that was, the people nominated for Best, who knew there was a Best  Choreography Emmy?  Wow.  And all the people nominated, Glee, were either on So You Think You Can Dance or Dancing with  the Stars.  Oh.  Every nominee came from one of those two shows.  Oh, really?  But they let those, they let the people nominated put together a dance number that was like 
[02:48:00]  interpretive dance of all the shows that were nominated.  It stunk.  Although I liked it when they put a teeny bit of Game of Thrones in there, because that's  the best theme song ever.  You like that one?  Oh, fuck is it good.  What about Elton John?  Was that good?  No, he sang it to Liberace.  Yeah, he sang a new song.  Or was it a candle up my ass?  Flamer in the wind?  He did have one moment where the hiv is back.  Don't blow a load of me. 
[02:48:30]  I'm only the piano player.  I wish I knew more of his song.  I know, right?  I'm going to go through the whole library here, and I'm not getting much.  Fuck the Emmys, then.  We're good.  Yeah, I mean, you could throw it around with the girls later on.  The ladies of the morning mashup.  Yeah, I haven't taken a leak all night.  Yeah, with the Metallica thing.  No word on anything. 
[02:49:00]  I'm telling you, I know how this is going to go.  Jimmy's still trying to get a picture with him.  But true.  What?  Tony Gans is coming in today, too.  I thought he said Danzig.  I know.  I heard Danzig.  E-Rock is brought to you by Mama Mancini's.  Wasn't this last week?  Yeah, but you didn't do one on Friday.  Oh, we skipped that.  Well, do we have an E-Rock moment?  We can't just do an E-Rock plug without an E-Rock moment.  Well, I could play an E-Rock song.  Why don't we all in tribute go to take a shit and come back late?  Oh, wow.  E-Rock, do you have the moment in delight?  No. 
[02:49:30]  Mama Mancini's, the meatball lover's meatball.  I heard that there's a new E-Rock song.  There's a few.  Is there a good one?  I don't know.  There's so many of them now.  Like, there's a dozen songs we haven't heard.  Wow, Jesus.  You want to play one or no?  So, I mean, we got...  You just have to do the mention.  No?  No E-Rock songs?  No, I mean, if you really want to, we could, but I figured we'd give you E-Rock a break today.  You haven't finished the mention yet.  Yeah, I did. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  I said it all.  No, you gotta say it in a row.  Nice.  I did do a nice...  Just, like, edit the middle part out.  It'll sound great for replay.  Just...  They know we love them.  What else do they want from me?  They make meatballs and we love them.  Fuck.  Mama Mancini's.  The meatball lover's meatball.  That's good, right?  That's great.  I gave them my own personal touch.  Love it.  Just get rid of the fucks.

[02:52:30]  It's been going on all morning.  Of course, Sam.  Look at him.  What happened?  He's pointing.  He's trying to get this figured out.  Oh, Iraq is brought to you by Mama Mancini's.  Mama Mancini's, the meatball lover's meatball.  All right.  Tony Danza!  Tony Danza.  Tony Danza's outside.  Just got to come in here.  Your eye just completely turned red.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a problem in my left eye.  Tony.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, how you doing?  Good?  I'm great.  I'm great.  All right.  What's going on with you, Tony?  How are you, brother?  Terrific. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  That's Sam, young Sam Roberts.  Take a seat.  Pull up a mic.  Looking like a million bucks, Tony.  Of course.  I feel good.  Like a million fucking bucks.  You look great.  You're in a musical.  We're on.  What are you doing?  I'm in a fucking minute.  I'm doing a musical called Honeymoon in Vegas.  Really?  I remember the picture?  Yeah.  With Nick Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker and Jimmy Conn.  I'm playing the Jimmy Conn part.  And Jason Robert Brown wrote a score for this thing.  It's great. 
[02:53:30]  And we're doing it at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.  Thursday night's the first preview.  And then open October 6th.  Broadway bound is the...  That's what you're going for, right?  The hope.  How much have you done acting, stage acting?  A lot of it over the years?  Or has it been more film?  No.  You know, I played Max Bialystok on Broadway.  I played the producers.  You know, I played the heavy set Jewish guy.  I mean, who says I got no range?  Come on.  Give me a break.  No, but I did...  I spent comments.  I did The View from the Bridge.  So, you know, I've had a little bit of experience. 
[02:54:00]  But this is the first time that I'm going to, you know, originate a part, be on a cast album.  Give me a break.  All right.  Cast album now.  Yeah, you're not coming into the...  I saw you the other day.  Where did I see you?  You were great.  Oh, thank you.  You were funny.  Thank you.  Backstage in Metallica.  Did you see that?  Yeah, yeah.  How about Metallica was there last night?  By the way, if I run out the door, I apologize.  I'm obsessed with a Metallica photo and they're being interviewed down...  So, if I run through the...  That's what it's about.  He needs to get this picture done.  Yeah, how are you being interviewed? 
[02:54:30]  I can't remember what the hell the show was.  I caught you.  Oh, man.  Leto?  No, it wasn't Leto.  It wasn't a lot of Leto.  What the hell was it?  Could be a Leto.  You must know.  I don't know even.  I don't know.  That happens to me too.  Was it local?  Yeah, but who poop?  I don't know what I did recently.  He doesn't know.  Yeah, I was at the Yankee game yesterday and saw that whole thing with Mariano.  It was great, man.  Did you read the article in the Times yesterday about the send-off as opposed to a lot of the other  send-offs of the Yankee greats? 
[02:55:00]  DiMaggio and Whitey Ford.  You know, he was supposed to get his full year's salary.  They gave him two weeks severance pay.  Yeah.  I mean, it's true.  No, come on.  I'm a yogi, of course.  You know, that debacle.  And who else did they?  On Reggie.  And, you know, but this is one of the few where you get, you know, DiMaggio evidently has this, you know,  he has this last year.  It's not a great year.  And he's very unhappy.  He walks away and says he can't hit anymore, you know, and he walks away.  But, you know, this has been unbelievable. 
[02:55:30]  And he's the nicest guy, isn't he?  I mean, he's so humble.  It's amazing.  Very humble.  He's so respected in the league and also in life.  He's just done great things down in there in Panama.  You know, humility.  I was reading yesterday the Times, like Frank Bruni's comment.  We get it, Tony.  You read the Times.  I do.  I know.  I can't help it.  I read the Wall Street Journal.  I read the New York Post Times.  But he says he's talking about humility and how it's like, you know, it's not necessary 
[02:56:00]  in our society.  It's one of the things that we don't see much of when you see a little bit of it.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, it is cool.  But what about Andy Pettit?  Poor Andy Pettit.  I know.  Andy was out there.  He's like, hey, this is my last game, too.  They gave him a bow.  Yeah, they gave him a bow.  They gave him a little curtain call.  He came out.  He waved his hat.  And it's like, all right, take it easy.  Andy, do you want to tip your hat while Mariano's?  Do you want to tip your hat while Rivera's getting into the roles we got on here?  Just a little hat tip, Andy.  Well, they gave what?  Rivera an hour and a half before? 
[02:56:30]  Put the gas in that car.  It was amazing.  They gave him an hour and a half before the game.  They could have gave Pettit 10 minutes.  Yeah, 10 minutes.  Give him time.  He just announced it.  Let's just talk about the Yankees for one second.  Where we are right now.  In the shitter, as they say.  In the proverbial shitter.  What are they, six games to go, four back?  The party's over.  It's done.  They're not going to call us.  At least it's not a disappointing season, because right from the beginning, I think  we all knew that there was going to be trouble this year. 
[02:57:00]  And it's hard to judge it, you know, because of everything that happened.  I mean, you can't even.  You've got to give A-Rod.  I mean, A-Rod hasn't played bad since he's been back.  That's hilarious.  For a guy that hasn't played in a long time to come back and pick it up.  Has a Grand Slam Friday.  How about Selig would have been nuts if he was in the playoffs.  Yeah, right?  He hates himself.  He's in bed with Hank Aaron, Bud Selig, the commissioner.  So, he doesn't want anybody.  He didn't want Barry Bonds.  He doesn't want A-Rod touching Hank Aaron's records.  That's a personal issue. 
[02:57:30]  You really do?  You think that's true?  A hundred percent.  Absolutely.  I mean, you're just making up the rules by going, you're suspended 211 games or whatever  you wanted to give him.  You're just making shit up now.  You are making stuff up.  There's no precedent for that.  There's no, like, set thing.  He could just...  Sorry if he got caught and he goes, hey, give me those records before baseball gets them.  Pull it out of anywhere.  209.  209, yeah.  I thought 211 was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can handle that.  So, now, are you a song and dance man in this?  Well, yeah, actually, I got five songs. 
[02:58:00]  I was like, dance, yeah, I got a...  There's one time...  There's only one time in the show when there's only one guy on the stage singing and dancing.  Yeah.  Hey, you know who's in it?  Oh, man.  Rob McClure's in the kid that...  The actor...  I call him a kid because he is a kid, but the actor that got the Tony nomination for Chaplin.  The kid's really something.  Oh, wow.  He's really something.  He plays Jack.  Brent O'Malley from Annie and Avenue Q plays Betsy.  And, I mean, the show is just loaded with people. 
[02:58:30]  And, you know, my barometer is...  The barometer is that the ensemble, those people that are in shows and they can do eight parts and they do everything.  And it's amazing.  You know, you feel like you're hanging up by your fingernails because the choreographer goes, here's the step.  Boom.  They do it.  The music director says, here's the harmony.  Boom.  They do it.  And you're like, wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  And so these people that, you know, are like grizzled veterans, young grizzled veterans, are very excited about the material. 
[02:59:00]  A lot of great songs.  This guy wrote a great, great score.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I'm in Sinatra.  It's like Sinatra land.  It's really funny.  It's really...  It's Jimmy Codd's part as Sinatra...  People really were surprised when you come out and start singing and stuff because, you know, we know you're from Taxi originally.  And then, of course, Who's the Boss and stuff.  And not much singing and dancing going on there.  And I was...  I'll be honest with you.  Taxi really...  The end of Taxi, I took a tap dance lesson. 
[02:59:30]  That's what happened.  I got hooked on that.  And that sort of said to me, hey, you know, maybe I can do the rest of it.  Because if I start to stink, I can always tap.  You know what I mean?  So it sort of gave me a license.  And then, let me tell you, it wasn't easy.  I got to tell you, go out and sing.  Go out and put your...  I never looked...  Go out.  You ain't...  You're not a singer.  You don't have a trade.  Go try it.  See how your heart beats.  I never looked and saw that thought that, like, dancing was an easy thing.  That's got to be...  And especially, like you said, the choreographers, they did... 
[03:00:00]  I can't remember, like, two things in a row.  When you do it and it works...  And I'm telling you something.  Let me tell you.  I mean, there's a lot of things that are fun in the world.  Go do a musical.  First of all, it's the greatest team effort of all time.  You know, it's like a straight play is a team effort.  But a musical, there's so much going on.  Even the backstage choreography is crazy.  The quick changes.  The plays you got to run to here.  You got to be over there.  You got to make an entrance.  When I did The Producers, forget it.  That was the most fun.  And it's...  Everybody has to pull together. 
[03:00:30]  It's one of the great...  And you sing and dance.  How's that for a job?  Tony, you should...  What did you do yesterday?  You're singing there.  You should do the Spider-Man play, because I remember seeing you in your Spider-Man costume.  Back during your TV show.  Don't remind me.  You know what Bobby Darin said at the call when somebody yelled out,  Splee Splash!  You're going back further than I can to remember.  By the way, you're in one of the most underrated comedy films ever.  Fucking Hollywood Nights.  Oh my God, right. 
[03:01:00]  With Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Wu.  That was a funny, funny movie.  And it never got the credit it deserved as one of the fucking...  A really great comedy.  You know, I was...  I had a meeting with...  They were going to do a movie about John Gotti Jr.'s life.  So I had a meeting with John Gotti Jr., you know.  And so it's, you know, hey.  Hey.  And his bodyguard blocked out the sun.  It was amazing.  But anyway, he loves that movie.  He loves Hollywood Nights.  That was a very, very funny movie. 
[03:01:30]  My dick is in the punch.  It made me laugh.  Robert Wu was great.  That was a really funny movie.  He farts Willari.  Oh, yeah.  When he's the one-armed violinist and he drops the thing and his finger comes through like he caught it with his cock.  It fucking made me howl, that movie.  Yeah.  Lloyd Mutrix.  Lloyd Mutrix was the director.  Wow.  Who else is in that?  Bill Tennant.  Bill Tennant.  Who else is in that?  Besides you, Michelle Piper, and Robert Wall.  Bobby Wall.  Do you remember Joyce Heiser?  And she was in a few movies. 
[03:02:00]  And they were the Iron Box twins, the two girls.  Oh.  Eli Wallach's daughter.  Oh, man.  Which is one.  And, uh, yeah, I mean, it was...  Wait, was that the one when Turk...  Oh, no, no.  When Turk came on himself, that was a different one.  When he came in his pants.  Did you come, Turk?  Yeah.  I'm glad I came.  You know who that is?  Robert Wu.  No, but the girl.  Who's the girl?  Oh, wait, wait.  Turk, did you come?  The nanny.  That's, uh...  Oh, it was.  Whatever her name is.  Fran.  Fran Drescher.  Fran Drescher.  I love I'm giving you guys clues here. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, I know, right?  It's fun.  Any, uh, any, any TV in the, uh, future?  You're just pretty much live performances.  And movies.  And movies, of course.  Of course.  We had so much fun with, uh, when you were on, uh, the...  Had your Tony Danza show.  It was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had fun with it, too.  And I got abused, and it was, you know...  Oh, it was, it was just so much fun.  We would, we would watch.  It would actually come on, I guess, right before...  During our show?  No, I think.  Right before we were ready to leave or something, it would come on. 
[03:03:00]  We hung around and watched it.  And we made sure we tuned in and did kind of a commentary on the monologue.  My, my favorite thing with your segues.  Yeah, you know, you know what, uh, Joel McHale, uh, on TalkSoup called them Danzition.  Danzition.  That's right.  Well, that's flattering.  You know, murder and mayhem, too.  Hey, you know what I did this?  That was, yeah, yeah.  Because I remember a few of those, and it was like, uh, uh, yeah.  Yeah, it was an earthquake in California.  Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers. 
[03:03:30]  We gotta, you see this juggler?  We have...  And we were like, holy mother of God, did that stop short?  I know.  But, oh my God.  There's not a lot of forethought.  You know, it was just going.  You know what?  It was great.  It was very entertaining.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You weren't trying to be some, uh, some fake.  It was kind of nice to see somebody just talking normally on television.  You can't do it, though.  You can't do it.  And I'll be honest with you, you know, there was a time, I was really crushed when it was  canceled.  Really?  Yeah, I really liked it.  And plus, it's you, you know, Tony Danz's show.  Right, right.  It's got your name on it.  So, okay, uh, but, um... 
[03:04:00]  How many seasons was that on, Tony?  You know what, it wasn't due in two years.  Two years.  And it wasn't doing bad.  Uh-huh.  You know, we weren't, we were number one here in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But, um, now, so I'm out doing, when I was out for my book, I was out, and I'm going to  all these stations, I mean, these shows, and it's like, wait a minute.  It's so trivia.  It's like, oh, okay, this day in history.  Okay.  This day in history.  What is it?  In 2002, Mariah Carey had a hit with, and I'm like, what are you kidding me? 
[03:04:30]  What happened to the Hindenburg?  You know?  It's just, it's so, I don't, I wouldn't, I would be out of my mind.  There's a million of them, too.  Everyone's doing a talk show now.  And you have to just do these people.  Yeah, right, yeah.  And make it important.  Right, right.  Make it entertaining, important, fun.  What do you think you see here, Snooki?  You know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I mean, I, I, not that they are, it's just that, that's something you want to do.  It's not your thing right now.  You know?  Taxi did.  Taxi's one of the greatest shows ever.  You know, I tell you something about that.  It's one of the greatest, and you could still watch it.  Let me tell you what I have. 
[03:05:00]  So my son has a son, my grandson, right?  His name's Nick.  He's got two.  But his name's Nick.  And he's just about to turn eight when I was out there.  And when Mark was just about to turn eight, he did, my son, he did two episodes of Taxi.  He's got big shows.  He plays a kid in a wheelchair, and he plays another time for his kid that I adopt.  Oh, and then he chooses to go with the, uh, with the other guy.  Oh, yes, yes.  But the one in the wheelchair, he's, he's, uh, he, he writes a letter. 
[03:05:30]  He's a crippled kid in a hospital.  He's having operations.  He writes to a fighter.  Ando Muniz played at the Great Friday.  And he comes out of retirement.  This guy comes out of retirement to fight for this kid.  And who does he choose to fight?  Tony Panther.  And the only time Tony Panther wins a fight is when he beats this kid.  Oh, he beats the guy that was.  And, and Louie says, Louie says, you know, breaking the heart of a, ruining the comeback chances of America's greatest champion,  and breaking the heart of a little crippled kid all in one day.  I bet you're excited. 
[03:06:00]  So, the kid, my, my, one of my favorite lines with my son, and he was so great.  I'm not kidding.  He never acted.  He just did it.  And he's seven.  You know, he's like, it's unbelievable.  And they were like, actually, it was tough.  You missed a joke.  You got to get it.  You know, there's no fooling around.  He had a great line.  He said, you beat my fighter.  You know how hard it is to get a fighter to come to the hospital?  We keep getting singers.  Yeah.  So, so I showed my grandson his father. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, wow.  And I brought all of them.  And I showed him the episodes.  That's cool.  And he gets, first of all, watching your grandson, watch your son.  It was a lot.  That is really strange.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But anyway, so.  So anyway, is it happening?  He gets hooked.  Get a video.  And the same thing that happened to my son happened to him.  He gets hooked on Danny.  Oh, wow.  He's walking around going, I don't want to interrupt you.  I like what you're saying. 
[03:07:00]  You know what I'm saying with Danny.  Oh, it was amazing.  What's your thoughts on Andy Kaufman?  Did you like him?  Not at first.  We've heard over the years.  I thought he was a pain in the ass.  Yeah, we heard that.  We were all a team, and he was meditating in his car.  He didn't rehearse.  You know, he never had, he was never there all week.  We had a guy who did him.  Are you kidding me?  We rehearsed with the guy who did him.  Yeah.  How did he get away with that?  He was Andy Kaufman.  He came Tuesday.  But you guys are.  He came Tuesday for the run-through and Friday for the show.  And you know what? 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  I would piss.  Never made a mistake.  And in the gag reel, if you have a gag reel at the end of the year, he wouldn't be in  the gag reel because he never made a mistake.  How would he do?  How would he know what to, what to say?  No, he, oh, he knew he was, and then I really got to like him.  I mean, we had a lot of fun.  And then once you knew what he was up to, he just wanted you to wonder, you know, what  was going, what, you know, was that on the level, you know?  And he's so ahead of his time, if you think about it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he just, he really is like the forerunner of what a lot of people are doing now, you 
[03:08:00]  know?  It's, you know, it's really at the time when he took us all for milk and cookies after  one of his shows.  Right, yeah.  You know, or the wrestling is unbelievable.  He used to do, you know, Andy didn't look like much of an athlete, but he wasn't.  He was a little bit.  And what he would do when he did that wrestling is he'd pick the biggest girl and he'd aggravate  her to the point where she wanted to kill him.  And then he would, in the thing, make her think she could physically. 
[03:08:30]  And then when she really tried, because she thought she could get him, he'd get her.  And he'd crush her, and then he'd get up and like stomp on her, fake stomp on her, and  say, get back in and kiss her to take your shoes off, you know?  But it's brilliant because if you think about it, he makes it look like she's kicking his  ass before he turns on her.  And it makes her think she can win.  She doesn't actually win it.  And that means you go all out.  Oh, my God. 
[03:09:00]  And when you go all out and then get beat, you're humiliated.  Oh, man.  That's brutal.  It was brutal.  It was brutal.  And you know, the movie, the movie doesn't do justice to that.  I didn't like the movie.  You know, it doesn't do it.  And it doesn't do justice.  There's a lot of no humor.  But did they do justice to that day on the set when he decides, when they fire him, and  he comes with these two hookers, and he brings them in, and he says, I rewrote the script,  and in my version, these girls are going to sit on my lap during the whole show. 
[03:09:30]  And he brought these little, you know, remember those little stuffed animal dogs with the wire  and you push one button and barks, another button and it rolls over?  Well, he brought everybody those.  So these things are running around.  These things are barking on the set.  This is the surreal situation.  He's in Orange Brocade, by the way.  He's in Orange Brocade.  And what happened was, is that he had made a deal with Ed Weinberger.  Ed was one of the producers. 
[03:10:00]  He said, you can fire me.  Because Ed told him, look, it's not working.  He was trying to play a guy, playing a guy, you know, he's playing Louis' brother.  But he was being Tony Clifton, playing Louis' brother.  Right.  And it was horrible.  And they went out and hired Richie Ferranji, 150.  That's how he said 150.  I better hump 50.  But anyway, so he made a deal.  But you've got to fire me in front of people.  You've got to fire me in front of everybody.  So that when the run-through was time for the run-through, people started showing up. 
[03:10:30]  The bleachers started filling up.  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  And he comes in and he does this thing with the girls and the dogs and everything else.  And Ed goes over and says, Andy, look, Tony.  Because you couldn't call him Andy.  You know, Andy was late.  This guy was early.  Andy didn't like to rehearse.  This guy wanted to rehearse first thing in the morning.  He got his own contract.  That's funny, unless you're a part of this whole thing.  You've got to deal with it.  So here's how it goes.  I know.  Wait a minute.  We were sworn.  We had to say.  We couldn't say it.  We couldn't go. 
[03:11:00]  I cut the baloney.  We had to say, yeah, okay, Tony, or whatever.  We had to deal with him as Tony Clifton.  And all of us, Judd, everybody.  But everybody was like up to here this day.  Fed up, yeah.  So when he gets fired, he starts screaming, you can't fire me.  I got the biggest contract.  I got the biggest contract.  And he's screaming.  And Judd was sitting.  I'll never forget.  Judd was sitting on the running board of one of the cabs.  He was sitting there.  And he was just sitting there watching, you know.  Finally, you could just see it.  He blew up. 
[03:11:30]  No.  I got the biggest contract.  And they get in a wrestling match.  They're on the ground.  Ed goes over.  And it's like, you know those cartoons where there's a fight.  And it's like dust.  And you reach in.  And you get pulled in.  Boom.  He said, security comes.  They drag him off.  It was unbelievable.  It was just the craziest thing.  What a maniac.  I know.  He was a maniac.  I don't know how you work with that.  You know what, though?  It's amazing.  When you worked with him, I got to own my best scenes with him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, shut up.  When we say shut up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  No, you shut up.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I mean, I think about the show a lot.  And, you know, it's a great show for an eight-year-old to watch.  Right.  Because invariably what happens is people get in trouble.  Everybody comes to your age.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's about loyalty and about friendship.  It's such a different, you know, just a different mentality.  Yeah, yeah.  And who's the boss is on, like, everywhere still.  Yeah, it's still around.  It's amazing.  You know, when I was teaching in Philadelphia, kids, they don't know who I was. 
[03:12:30]  One kid says, I think my mother's a fan.  You know, it was like that.  Or one kid says, isn't he in Cheers?  You know, something.  Like, so the year was going on, and it came on during the year.  You know, it came back to an empty run.  And the kids started watching it, you know.  And they'd come in and say, hey, it was a dancer.  It's pretty funny.  You know, you didn't walk like you do now.  How was that?  The teaching after acting. 
[03:13:00]  It's the greatest.  You know, it changed my life.  Really?  Yeah, because I think if anybody who spends a year in an inner city school in America,  a public school, will have their opinions changed about education, about kids, about  teachers, about everything.  I mean, it's, you know, one of the things that I talk about now, because I'm an educator,  education advocate.  I see that.  Yes.  Look, New York Times best.  We see that. 
[03:13:30]  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Anyway, I wish my parents were around.  Anyway, one of the things you see is, you know, there's a move to privatize.  And, you know, I keep thinking, how do you privatize schools?  First of all, privatize education.  We've got to profit on education.  But anyway, how do you privatize schools and not have a two-tier system?  Because there are motivated kids with motivated parents and guardians who will go to the  good school.  The other kids are going to get left behind.  And that's where the budget cuts will be.  So, and we've tried two-tier.  It doesn't work.  So, I think the one thing that's missing is this commitment to educate all our kids like 
[03:14:00]  there was when we were kids.  You know, there was no talk of it.  There was no question.  Right.  You know, I mean, and nobody had to pay $40,000 a year to go to a private school.  I mean, it's, we have to really make, we have to come to grips with these, you know,  it's like, I don't want to pay for the deadbeats either.  Believe me.  But I don't think you can literally throw the babies out with the bathwater, you know,  because it's not the kid's fault.  Yeah.  It's, it's not.  The thing with the teachers, though, apparently it's very hard to fire an incompetent teacher. 
[03:14:30]  Now, now, not somebody that's doing a good job and, you know, you're trying to clean  house or cut budgets or whatnot.  The obvious ones.  I agree with you.  But the obvious ones.  I agree.  No, I agree with you.  But you know what, you know what I saw, and this is where you get a different vision.  Are there bad teachers?  You bet your life there's bad teachers.  There's bad everything.  Just like there's bad actors.  But, but what I saw is mostly discouraged teachers.  Wow.  Discouraged.  You know, let me tell you what the statistics are.  30% quit after three years and 50% after five years. 
[03:15:00]  They throw in the towel.  And let me tell you, I went to orientation.  I had to go to orientation, do all this stuff in Philadelphia.  It's called New Beginnings, Strong Beginnings.  800 first-year teachers, right?  Mostly kids.  I mean, there was some experienced people coming from other districts and stuff, but mostly  out of college, dressed like teachers, ready to take on the world.  And I'm telling you, you could have taken on the world with these kids.  They were ready to, to really change the world and, and contribute.  Five years later, 50% of them give, you know, say, I got to take it on the arches. 
[03:15:30]  Sounds like a staff.  Yeah, so it's, so that's, so okay, you're right.  There are problems.  And the unions, I think, have come a long way in addressing it.  You know, in New York, tenure used to be 94%.  It's down in the 50s now.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  So there's been, and nobody knows, but there's been a lot of, in this administration, you  can make an argument both ways, but at least they've, excuse me, they've, they've, they've  caused a real conversation about it. 
[03:16:00]  And a lot of these schools, you know, with, with teacher evaluation, I think good teachers  want to be evaluated.  I would love to have be evaluated.  If you're doing a good job, why not?  Show how well you are doing.  Yeah.  And then, and then it should be merit paid.  I mean, because when you do better everywhere else, you do better.  And why shouldn't, you know, there's certainly things that we should do, but it has to start  with a commitment, with a commitment to educate all our kids, because let me tell you, this  is so, it's so clear to me.  It says, pay me now or pay me a lot more later situation because stressed out and unprepared 
[03:16:30]  five-year-olds become, you know, unproductive adults who are unhappy and you got to pay for  them.  I don't, I don't understand where they go and they're going to be here.  So you ever see it changing?  Um, you know, it seems like it's a tough spot.  I think when you, you know, you look at what's going on, uh, I heard somebody say today, uh,  that what's going on in America, as far as the government and Congress and the president  is, uh, is a foreign policy issue.  He says, because in the world, it looks like you don't have to worry about them. 
[03:17:00]  They can't, uh, they can't build a road.  Forget about doing anything else.  And so I'm not sure.  I mean, listen, I, I, I listen to the stuff.  I, I, uh, I'm, I like, you see, I read the times, but I do read the other paper too.  Of course, I was in it last week, uh, but, uh, but, uh, which was weird, but, uh, but  I, I just, you know, it just seems pretty simple to me that, you know, we, we're all,  this is where I go.  This is my big thing. 
[03:17:30]  I tell them, I go to people, um, do you know the motto of America, the motto of America?  People go, especially young people.  They never heard about it.  I say, well, it's, it's, you know, it's, it's on the flag.  You know, people say, oh, in God, we trust.  No, that's not it.  Don't tread on me.  No, that's not it.  It's e pluribus unum.  It's on the money.  It's on our seal.  It's on the flag.  It means out of many one that we're all in this together.  You know, in the war years, everybody was, you know, and, and because of that, everybody's 
[03:18:00]  together.  Now the new motto is, Hey, I got mine.  How come you ain't got yours?  You know, and so, you know, it's like my father used to say, my father, uh, big, you  know, world war two, uh, uh, bronze star, this uses, we lost a brother or this country  meant so much to him and gave me so much.  And he used to say, Hey, e pluribus unum, I mean, we're all in this together, pal.  I go, no, that's not what it means, but, you know, but that's paraphrasing.  And we, we forgot that. 
[03:18:30]  We just forgot that.  Yeah.  There's such divide now.  And, uh, as far as getting Congress to, uh, work with each other and, uh, but I think  it's amazing how divided it is, but I think, you know, it's a simple thing.  You got to buy in either, you know, it's the thing is if, if everybody doesn't buy in,  nobody's got to buy in a little bit and like, let's take this thing with the, uh, the affordable  care act, you know, the Obamacare, you know, don't get me wrong.  Every time you institute any kind of huge legislation like this, it's always has to be adjusted. 
[03:19:00]  It has to be, there's resistance, there's, but, but if you work together, you get there.  Why, instead of this, all this, you know, we got to defund it, we got to, the guy's not  going to sign a defund it thing.  Why don't they try to make it better?  I think a lot of people would go for that.  I don't understand what this.  Well, no one wants to work together to make something that the other side came up with  better because it will just turn into a next campaign commercial.  Well, when I had my show, I had McCain on, and this is when McCain was, before he went, 
[03:19:30]  you know, nuts and back, you know, I can't get over the guy, you know, saying, let's bomb  the hell out of Syria, and then they catch him playing video poker during the hearing.  During the hearing.  And then he doesn't even get it.  He makes a joke about it.  It goes, thousands of dollars.  But when he was on my show, and this is, like I said, back when I really was fond of him,  I said, and he was there to promote his book, and I started sneaking a question. 
[03:20:00]  So I said, man, I said, okay, before we start on the book, just with all due respect, does  party Trump country, you know?  And he looked at me like, hey, man, I'm here for your book.  But he wouldn't, you know.  Great question, by the way.  But he wouldn't answer.  Of course not.  But that's what you're saying.  You're saying, you know, somebody's going to use it in a campaign ad.  Exactly.  He absolutely will.  I don't know.  And that's the problem.  Well, noblesse oblige.  Remember noblesse oblige.  Years ago, it seemed like more politicians were more apt to do what was best for the country 
[03:20:30]  as opposed to coming up with the next campaign ad for what they're doing or not doing.  It's just, yeah.  You think it has a lot to do with the money?  The money in the system?  Because you can just...  Yeah.  Did you see that Obamacare ad?  I mean, the anti-Obamacare ad with the girl on the table?  No, I haven't seen that one.  I don't believe you two guys haven't seen this one.  There's two of them.  So there's like an $800,000 buy to discourage young people, millennials, from signing up.  This girl goes to the gynecologist, and she's talking to the gynecologist, and the gynecologist 
[03:21:00]  walks in.  She gets in a stirrup.  She's on the table.  And all of a sudden, a giant monster, Uncle Sam, comes up between her legs.  He's like lurking.  You're looking around.  And then when he goes away, he's got the force.  He's got the spreader.  This is the craziest thing.  And you know what?  Effective.  Yeah.  And that's what I'm saying.  I would assume.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess that's not being played on.  They're saying Tony's got to go.  You're a busy man. 
[03:21:30]  We could talk to you all day.  Hey, my movie.  Yes.  I mean, before we go, the movie's Friday Night.  Yep.  It's a terrific joke.  Did an unbelievable job.  It has something to say, and it makes you laugh.  Don John.  And it's so brave.  What do you see with this kid did?  It's wild.  Yeah, I saw it.  He was like, he wrote it, and directed it.  He wrote it, directed it.  And let me tell you.  And stars in it.  Because it has something to say.  It's funny.  It captures a moment of the culture.  You know, I was thinking, it's up against Rush.  And everybody, I think about being a race car driver, but I never did it. 
[03:22:00]  A lot of guys have driven their computers.  All right.  Hey, let's see you later.  Tony, thanks so much.  Tony Vance, everyone.  Thanks, Tony.  Thank you so much.  Pleasure.  Come back and see us.  Absolutely.  Come back and see us, will you?  Really good.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  And families are okay.  We're all good, brother.  Everyone's good.  Don't forget your coffee.  And my book.  Yes, yes.  We'll plug that out of it.  And the show.  The musical.  And the musical.  Tony's busy.  Tony Vance is busy.  Look, it's right out the door. 
[03:22:30]  Tony Vance is busy.  Look, who's there?  Frankie.  Frank Sinatra.  Frank, good luck.  All right.  He's full of energy.  I've got to say that.  We see him at the gym.  Do you?  Oh, my God.  He just, I don't know.  Yeah.  Does he, is he like.  People can't get reps in.  He works the entire room.  Oh, oh, really?  I wanted to ask him.  He was, he went to, I wanted to ask him if it was a goof. 
[03:23:00]  He was trying to be the mayor.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Open that door.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, shit.  Hold on.  Let me see that.  Tony.  Yeah.  Weren't you running for mayor?  I was just telling Anthony.  I, I, I'm on the air.  I opened my mouth at a, at a, on a, on a red carpet.  You're on the air still, by the way.  I know.  Okay.  I opened my, I opened my mouth.  We're not trying to catch it.  Like it, like it means anything.  You can't, it doesn't matter.  I, uh, I opened my mouth on a red carpet that I would, uh, that I think I could be a force 
[03:23:30]  for the, a good, a good thing for the city.  Uh-huh.  And I'm in that stage of my life where I, I, you know, I'd like to give it a shot.  Sure.  In the end, I thought about it.  I, I don't think I could stand the scrutiny.  It's just being critical.  All right.  All right.  Tony, thanks, man.  Well, see, he's downplaying it.  In the gym, he was all about it.  Was he selling it?  Oh, boy, was he selling it.  I would do this and this and this and this.  Listen, my fellow New Yorkers.  And there's guys that just want to get a couple reps in it, but they feel like they can't do  reps when he's talking about being mayor.  Come on, let me fucking do it. 
[03:24:00]  I, I would love to know what's happening down that fucking hallway.  Jimmy, and, uh, No, I don't.  I've been, I haven't been nowhere in here.  Go run, because we gotta, we gotta leave.  There's, uh, All right, hang on.  I don't care.  We can handle this.  Just run real fast and give us a really quick update.  Jesus.  The people want to know.  Or, You're giving him an impossible task.  Run real fast.  He just flipped the bird to me.  I thought he was out of that studio.  If he goes fast, he'll be back by 1030.  I know.  Yeah, Florentine, uh, Jim Norton got up, then Florentine got up, and then Sam took off, 
[03:24:30]  I guess, to record the, the tragedy.  I hope, I hope, no, I hope he gets it, but I, there's part of me that hopes he didn't  get it.  We all are hoping he didn't get it.  Yeah, okay, I'll be honest.  That's, that's a solid hour of radio tomorrow.  He didn't get it, and I'm hoping it's for a reason.  Yeah.  That, uh-oh.  Oh, Sam won!  Sam walked in wincing.  Wincing.  Nothing's happened yet.  They're still in there.  Right.  It's looking not 100% right now. 
[03:25:00]  Why, why, why?  Tell us what's going on.  Various people.  You guys all blew off Tony Danza.  I think he's insulting.  Poor Tony Danza.  We were talking about that in the hall.  Half the room left.  Oh my God.  What happened?  He's talking to various people in management.  Right.  But a lot of people have come up to him and saying, we're going to try, I just don't want  to be the bad guy if, and we got a lot of people coming out all at once.  I don't know if they're going to be together.  When are they coming out?  Any minute?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm going to go check.  Do you understand how impossible it's going to be?  Hold on, before Sam runs away. 
[03:25:30]  Is Jimmy really pissed?  Yeah, he's really tense.  We're a little bit spaced away from him, because I'm trying to get an angle in case there's  anything to preserve.  No, it's because you don't want to be around the energy that's happening right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a...  Oh my God.  Is he spiraling out of control?  I'm going to go find out.  Is it a spiral?  Oh yeah.  It's a spiral.  It's just getting worse and worse.  It's ramping up, spiraling down.  I will assume that...  Well, Sam will have an update on the after show.  I think this is going to be a good after show.  Was that Eric Bana that was here? 
[03:26:00]  I don't think so.  Oh.  It looked like him.  E-Rock?  I could have sworn I saw him.  We did the meatball thing already.  Yeah.  Bruce Banner.  Did he get an update?  Banner, Banner, Banner, whatever his name is.  Like Sam was saying, he was running back.  There's a whole crowd waiting around Howard's door there, because they've got all their equipment  and everything.  Uh-huh.  Ain't going to happen.  Dude, do you know what it would be like to get those four guys?  Oh my God.  They don't travel around in a gaggle, the whole band together, unless they're doing something.  So, want to leave, want to go to the bathroom.  Do you think they're going to be able to get all four of them together? 
[03:26:30]  Jimmy will.  In front of that thing.  Jimmy will start working with Jimmy.  It ain't going to happen.  All right, Lars, you stay here.  We'll wait for James.  Do you think they'll wait?  I've seen him try to do it.  Try to line up like a class trip.  Yeah, yeah.  This ain't going to happen.  Oh my God.  Poor Jimmy.  It's going to be great for either the after show, or our show tomorrow, or both.  Oh.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  He will lose his mind.  Poor Jimmy.  He has it in his little heart that he's getting us done.  Oh, Tony Danza.  I've got to leave. 
[03:27:00]  You didn't ask him about the bowls in the Spider-Man house?  Oh, no.  I brought it up.  We were going there.  I brought it up.  He just didn't want to.  He's like...  We were going there.  I know exactly what Dan was doing.  Uh-huh.  He was feeling the water.  He put his toe in the water.  With a little joke.  Yeah.  I brought it out with a joke, and he was like...  And then he moved on fast.  Yeah, yeah.  He did.  I was ready to say that, you know, you're sporing some good heat.  You think he's aware.  Some good heat?  Yeah.  I was ready, but then he moved on really fast. 
[03:27:30]  He did.  He put his toe in, and I'm like, all right, I'll dive in.  Fuck you.  Do you think he's aware?  Of course he is.  That picture made it everywhere.  It's all about us?  About us.  And how brutal we were?  Oh, I don't think so.  Well, I told him about, you know, how we would goof on a show a little bit, but I didn't  talk about it a lot.  I thought that was brave.  I figured what the fuck.  That was kind of brave.  You know, he seems like he's got a sense of humor, you know?  A little bit.  I liked him.  I hope he comes back. 
[03:28:00]  I know.  I like Tony Dan.  He looks great, too.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He was all gussied up.  Got a full head of hair on him.  Mm-hmm.  Doesn't look too old.  Yeah.  What were you saying about Jimmy?  Before you interrupted, and then I interrupted him.  I said, I think Jimmy's going to be very disappointed.  No, he's just not going to get all of them together.  It can't happen.  Oh.  If they were all in one place, maybe.  If they were all milling about in the lobby area, he might be able to. 
[03:28:30]  But if they're coming out one at a time to leave, do you think Jimmy's going to go, could  you wait here while the rest of the guys from the...  He'd be like, no, I'm going.  Who are you?  You left Metallica a little early.  As soon as the show was over, Jimmy absolutely enjoyed himself.  We all enjoyed ourselves, obviously.  Uh-huh.  As soon as we left the venue, he started talking about Monday and the group picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he didn't even let the, I don't know, the feelings that he got from the concert... 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, they instantly turned negative.  Yeah, he instantly turned that amazing experience off, and he was already on to, okay, so Monday.  All right, I got...  And was going through his whole fucking plan with us.  Because all weekend long, he must have been thinking about Monday.  I was out with the kids yesterday, and I happened to bump into them.  That's when we were doing the dumb air guitar and shit.  Uh-huh.  His opening line was, oh, Monday, I'm thinking...  And I'm like, okay, all right.  He is going to be so disappointed. 
[03:29:30]  It's going to be interesting tomorrow.  Tragic.  A little tease for tomorrow's show.  It's tragic.  All right.  We'll have a whole list of people to blame.  Yes, a whole list of new assholes in this place.  See, I...  I sort of explained on the show.  I guess we're doing our own after show now.  But with Jimmy, I know how serious this picture-taking thing is.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's no joke.  Crazy.  Whatsoever.  It's his thing.  Big time.  And he gets real... 
[03:30:00]  We all know, because we've all lived it.  But I know it's great to needle him for the show, but I'm also scared, because if you poke  a little too hard, he's going to fucking...  He's going to turn on you.  He is.  He'll bite.  So it's this fine little balancing act, because when you needle him a little bit just to get  him going, it's too much fun for the show.  But on a personal level, because we're friends off the air, it's fucking brutal.  Because he takes it so seriously.  E-Rock?  You guys brought up earlier how Jim can't just be happy getting what he wants, because then 
[03:30:30]  he thinks of the next thing, and then gets all upset again.  Exactly.  So if he does get this photo, he'll be happy for a moment, and then he'll be upset that  they weren't on the show.  So then he'll be upset again.  So he'll just go right back into that place.  He'll only be happy, though, if the photo is good, because that's a whole thing, too.  It's not even good enough that you've got a photo with this person or group.  Now the photo has to be good.  Then he's got to mail it out to get signed.  Thank you.  And then it's not over yet, because then his new mission is to get the whole band to sign 
[03:31:00]  the photo he took with the band.  Oh, he blew a head gasket before, because the photography place that he gets his pictures  from forgot his Danza picture, I guess, his Tony Danza picture.  And now we're in trouble, because we didn't get any of his shit signed, because we forgot.  Oh, shit.  We're on the shit list.  We're on the shit list.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no, his book.  That's why the Tony Danza book's there.  That's why Tony's like, oh, my book.  That's Jimmy's Tony Danza book, and he's assuming we did the right thing and had him sign it. 
[03:31:30]  So we're on his shit list now.  Do you want to just sign it for him?  I was going to say, we should just sign it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me the Sharpie.  All right, hold on.  Because we're on a shit list, for sure.  No, he likes it on the cover.  On the cover?  No, no, no.  Don't put it on the cover, because he does like it on the cover.  Yes.  All right, here.  Here.  It'll be...  To Jim...  Thoughts and Prayers.  Yes.  And we'll even say, we got him to write Thoughts and Prayers. 
[03:32:00]  Thoughts...  And...  Prayers.  There you go.  And now, oh, my God.  Now you gotta just fuck around.  Tony?  Yeah, fuck up the...  Don't write out...  Yeah, there you go.  Perfect.  He never wrote out the whole last name.  No, no, no.  Ever.  He'll open that, he'll smell it, then he'll read it.  But now he's gonna be pissed that it wasn't on the front page.  Oh, God. 
[03:32:30]  Oh.  Well, we couldn't put it on the...  It's like...  Even when we're fucking with it, we can't do the right thing.  Oh, my God.  Shit.  We gotta...  Oh.  Someone's gotta back us up.  Tony Danza left in the middle.  You know, we were still on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't even get pictures with him.  No.  I'll just get one at the gym.  Whew.  All right, y'alls.  That was fun.  That was fun. 
[03:33:00]  Flew by today.  That was a good, fun little show.  Jim Florentine, of course.  Does he have a plug or anything?  What does he got?  Jim Florentine's podcast, Comedy Metal Midgets.

Sort of.  After O&A Live with Sam Roberts.  It's next.  Next.  Next.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live with your official wrap-up on Metalligate 2013. 
[03:35:00]  E-Rock, you were in the studio.  You didn't even see what was going down.  No.  They refused to end the show until they found out what was going on with Jim.  Did they find out the ending?  Well, you came in right before I did with an update. 
[03:35:30]  And then I went down again.  I said, there's just too many people in the lobby.  I don't think this is going to happen.  But they didn't get an ending.  They just, no, not where Jim came in after the break.  But they just concluded that this was not going to happen.  But we don't know for sure.  All I said was Jim Norton has left the building.  He's not here anymore.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number to call this show.  Of course.  We're all talking about Metallica.  And that concert that SiriusXM put on on Saturday night, I've been to a good amount of shows. 
[03:36:00]  Not that many metal shows, but just shows in general.  I've seen a lot of very good live acts.  And Metallica at the Apollo was among the best concerts I've ever been to.  That's why I refused to leave early.  I don't know if you heard the first hour of the show, but Opie was complaining that I wouldn't let him leave  until both encores were done, until the band had exited the stage, until the house lights were up.  I was Opie's date to the Metallica concert. 
[03:36:30]  Daniel, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Sammy, professional broadcaster, you rule.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, I noticed something in the first hour of today's show.  Yeah.  Each day, Opie goes on about what he ate the night before, if he ate the Lucky Charms.  Well, it's a hot topic these days.  All the listeners want to know, was Opie able to go to bed without his bowl of Lucky Charms?  He's trying to get in shape, you know?  Well, I agree, but it's kind of a callback to last week's episode of the Sam Roberts Show Online podcast, 
[03:37:00]  where you were talking with Rosenberg about the old bit of where they checked in and what you ate every night.  I'm just wondering if it's possible that Opie is a secret member of the Sam Roberts Show Online listening audience.  I think I'll hang up and listen.  Thank you, Daniel.  You're a professional caller.  I think that's an excellent theory.  E-Rock, do you think that there could be any...  Opie explaining to us every day what did he have for his late night snack.  Is that a callback to what did Sam have for dinner six years ago or seven years ago? 
[03:37:30]  That could be possible, but then again, I only figured out that the L.A. on your podcast title there meant listening audience.  I thought you put that on since you did wrestling interviews in L.A.  No, no, I call the audience.  I think everybody needs, like, you know, the Pests, the Bubba Army.  I don't know if Stern has a name, but I feel like S-R-S-O-L-A is just something that's so catchy.  I'm a few weeks behind, so I'm catching up.  All right.  Quinn in California.  Sam, hey, how's it going?  Good.  I was just laughing my ass off at the 15-minute delay, but, oh my God, they were talking about Jimmy like he was a special needs child. 
[03:38:00]  I'm telling you, like, when Jim gets into I need this mode, especially when it comes to a celebrity photo, there is no reasoning with him.  We all know that we had to get down, like, going into the show today, after what happened, because what happened at the concert was SiriusXM, they put together this amazing show.  Like, when SiriusXM throws a party, we say what we'll say about them on a day-to-day basis, but they know how to throw a party. 
[03:38:30]  Okay?  And they set up this thing where, since I went with Opie, Opie had these nice tickets where there was a meet-and-greet set up, and Opie, Anthony, and Jim were invited to go to this meet-and-greet before the Metallica show.  So, we get up there, and Jim is already there.  He was there early, and he's saying, you know, what if one of the members doesn't show up?  And he knew that somebody wasn't going to be there, and I was just sitting there going, I don't know. 
[03:39:00]  I didn't know this was going to happen to me yesterday, so I was just psyched that anybody from Metallica was coming up to take a photograph with me.  But, as it turns out, at the meet-and-greet, James Hetfield doesn't show up.  So, the Metallica meet-and-greet was with Lars and Kirk in them.  No James.  Just the other three guys.  So, whatever.  We all took our photos.  Jim was obviously disappointed that this didn't happen.  And so, we go down to the concert, which happens right after that, and it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever heard. 
[03:39:30]  I mean, they started out with a hit-the-lights, master-of-puppets, ride-the-lightning, like medley, and they did everything.  They did Sad But True and Sanitarium, and we listened earlier on the show today.  We played, what, For Whom the Bell Tolls and Seek and Destroy.  Those are the ones we listened to, right?  Yes.  Let's close today with another song from Metallica.  Do we have, do we play Memory Remains?  No, I don't know if that one was cut. 
[03:40:00]  I'll tell you which ones we had cut still.  Yeah, please do.  Give me one second.  Okay, so, we all watch this concert.  We're in the sixth row, okay?  SiriusXM really hooked it up, and they did.  They gave us laminates, and they gave us free t-shirts, and the bar was free, and there were hors d'oeuvres being passed around.  Everything was free.  It was amazing.  It was a celebration of life.  And so, after we see, and the Apollo Theater is in the middle of Harlem, and it's this theater that, if you don't know, it's mainly for black acts and low level. 
[03:40:30]  It only seats, like, 1,300 people.  So, the fact that Metallica is playing at this venue is, like, a once-in-a-lifetime scenario.  What's the other songs, E-Rock?  The other songs that we have cut, but we haven't played, are Sad But True and Master of Puppets.  We'll do Master of Puppets.  That was really good.  All right, that's eight minutes long.  How long was Sad But True?  We're going to go Sad But True.  Yeah, we'll go Sad But True at the end of the show.  There you go.  But, like, for me, I know I always, on the show, I mainly advocate for pop music. 
[03:41:00]  And that's, one, because I definitely listen to pop music.  And two, well, two, to be a contrarian, because I like to argue.  And three, because there's nobody doing that.  Because there isn't anybody saying, well, actually, this is good, or I actually enjoy this.  Because, you know, as far as the voice of metal or rock, there's three voices in here that firmly support metal.  So I don't feel the need to do it every day.  So a lot of people were surprised that I was even excited about this show.  But when I was in, like, sixth, seventh, eighth grade, I was just a little poser metalhead. 
[03:41:30]  You know, like, I was just this little nerd with a denim jacket with heavy metal patches all over it.  That's when I got into White Zombie and Rob Zombie.  I ended up getting the logo and autograph tattooed on my arm.  But being at that show just brought me all the way back to being a little kid, being a seventh grader,  and just remembering how badass it was to just be a little metalhead.  I was headbanging my afro-ed head off my neck at that show. 
[03:42:00]  It was amazing.  So we leave the show.  And I'm sitting there, like, it's one of those experiences where you're just on cloud nine.  And you're like, I can't believe I got to see this amazing show.  And you're looking around at everybody around you, like, you know, we're all family here.  Because we all got to experience this awesome thing.  I was happy.  I just wanted to hug people.  Eric, you went to see the show.  Unfortunately, people were asking me on Twitter.  I ended up being Opie's date.  I don't know how.  But you already had tickets through your wife, correct? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, I got my own ticket.  So you were up in the balcony.  That's why we were in different spots.  Not like the upper, upper top.  I was just above where you guys were.  But like I said, the Apollo seat's like 1,300.  Yeah.  So there is no bad seat.  No, I had, there was nothing obstructing the view.  Yeah.  You could see everything on the stage.  Even with you guys on the floor, as close as you were.  Yeah.  If everyone stood up, you still had to stand up and kind of weave through people just to see everything on the stage.  I got to.  Here's looking down, you saw everything.  I felt bad because I was sitting in front of Patrick Wilson from Insidious. 
[03:43:00]  And Insidious 2 and The Conjuring.  And he had brought his son, who was like eight or something.  And his son had these giant, like, headphone ear protector things on.  Oh, I saw them, yeah.  But I was sitting in front of his son.  And, you know, Patrick Wilson did the Sam Roberts show last week here on this channel on Sunday.  Did he remember you?  Yeah, we were talking for a little while before the show.  And I felt bad because I was like, do you want me to duck down or something?  He was like, no, we're all going to be standing anyway.  I was like, okay.  But I felt like I was blocking this little eight-year-old's view, little mini Patrick Wilson, all night. 
[03:43:30]  He was also in Hard Candy, Patrick Wilson.  But, yeah, like I said, was it the loudest show you've ever been to?  Yeah.  Before that, I saw Soundgarden at The Rock in Newark.  And I don't know if the sound was just bad, but it was so loud, it was deafening.  Were you up close?  No.  For Soundgarden?  We were in one of those, you know, like the hockey suites.  And it was that loud?  Because that's like a 15,000-seat arena. 
[03:44:00]  I honestly don't think that the sound guy calibrated right for that size arena because it was just bouncing all over the place.  But until then, Metallica was hurting my head.  After the third song, I had to get earplugs.  Dude, I didn't get earplugs because I wanted to be like, no pussy shit for me.  I am going to experience this.  It's the same reason I didn't want to leave early.  It's the same reason I got there early.  I wanted to experience everything humanly possible.  And I woke up on Sunday morning with a headache. 
[03:44:30]  My neck is still sore.  My hearing is not all the way back, but it was only 50% when I woke up yesterday.  I got most of my hearing back last night.  Like, I woke up hungover, and I don't drink.  Yeah, you had a bad headache.  But it was worth it.  Yeah.  I went to get some Chipotle and Mr. Pibb, and everything was fine after that.  After the show, we got a late dinner and brought it home.  And we're watching Big Lebowski.  And I'm sitting there looking.  I can't understand any of the conversation going on in the movie.  It's just mumbling.  And had I not seen that movie so many times, I'd have no idea what was going on. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  The only thing I heard was John Goodman yelling, shut the fuck up, Donnie.  Well, that's your favorite line.  Because he yells that.  Everything else you really couldn't hear.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I mean, the hearing was shot, but it was amazing.  Was it the best show you've ever been to?  Yeah, it has to be.  So you know what I'm talking about, Dan, when you experience something like that that is  so amazing that you just want to be like, look at what we did together, everybody.  Yeah.  So I'm leaving with that kind of attitude, and Jim was right down there with us. 
[03:45:30]  And he was like, what an amazing show, huh?  And I was like, yeah, that was incredible.  And he was like, yeah, I just wish James had been there for the meet and greet.  He couldn't enjoy the moment.  I was like, we're not even out of the Apollo yet.  This show was so loud.  I'm sure that outside the Apollo on the streets of Harlem, there was music playing that has  never been played there before.  Well, when people started taking photos when Metallica first got on stage, I did a reverse  search on Twitter, like for Metallica, Apollo, to see some of the photos that people were 
[03:46:00]  putting up.  There were just tons of black guys taking photos from the street of the marquee.  Yeah.  Just saying like, I don't believe this shit.  Metallica's at the Apollo.  Yeah.  And just sounds.  Like, what's that?  What's that?  Electric guitar?  What is that?  Enter Sandman riffs, start playing, and they've never heard the song before?  That was probably the safest Harlem has been in a long time.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Those white metal fans started getting drunk towards the end of the show.  Well, like I said, when they were on those buses that the company was providing, as we 
[03:46:30]  were leaving, one of them was pulling into the intersection, and two guys were on the  top part of the bus towards the back, jumping and trying to touch the traffic light as it  was going through the intersection.  Right.  So, I mean, I don't know how safe it was.  It was safe in the sense that there wasn't any black-on-white crime, but white-on-white  crime was probably at an all-time high in Harlem.  Imagine cops getting that call, and they're not believing it.  Yeah, okay.  Like, that's not happening.  Oh, yeah.  What was...  Oh, Metallica. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, okay.  Good one, dispatch.  So, but SiriusXM was super prepared for everything.  Like, not only...  Everything together.  Like E-Rock said, not only did they have buses waiting for people outside the show, so it's  like, we can't...  I guess...  I didn't even think of this, but they're very smart in Sirius, at SiriusXM.  We don't give them enough credit, because somebody said, we cannot invite 1,500 of our listeners  to Harlem and then just tell them to find their own way home Saturday at 11 o'clock at night.  And that was...  And it's true. 
[03:47:30]  So, they got buses.  It was pouring rain.  What happens?  Nobody gets wet.  And everybody gets SiriusXM ponchos.  Yeah, I never would have thought of that.  No, me neither.  But I had a leather jacket on.  And I was sitting there going, oh, fuck.  Because you can't wear leather in the rain.  It gets ruined.  But I got a poncho.  I was like, this is incredible.  You know, stupid me.  They're handing them out.  And, you know, my wife takes one, and I take one.  And they're in these little white bags.  And I looked at it quick.  I thought they were just handing out, like, SiriusXM t-shirts.  And I said, no thanks.  And I threw it back in the box. 
[03:48:00]  And as we're walking out, I'm like, oh, crap, it's raining.  And I turn around, and she's got the blue poncho on.  She didn't get one for you, though?  No, she just left.  She's like, you threw it back.  So I walked in the rain.  It's all about tough love in the Nagel household.  It's all about learning lessons.  As we were leaving, we saw Opie trying to part through the crowd to get out.  Right.  But you were nowhere in sight.  No, Opie wanted to get out of that place.  Opie would have left me.  And, by the way, that's the other thing.  I don't know.  Opie thought that I wasn't able to get back to his place from 125th Street. 
[03:48:30]  Like Anthony said, you just find a subway, and you go.  Florentine is coming back in here.  I just said that Jim's left the building, and I was giving people the background of what happened.  So after this show, Jim is obsessed with the photo.  Like he's not as good as the show was and as good a time as he had and as much it was a big deal to him.  He's obsessed about this photo.  So they're in today to do Stern.  And this is where we're at now. 
[03:49:00]  Jim went down there during the last part of the show trying to get the photo.  You sat with him.  What's the most intense you've seen him over a photo?  It wasn't this time.  This time was pretty bad.  I'm trying to remember.  Probably like a Metallica, maybe a Giant Stadium that Opie was talking about earlier in the show.  Okay, so the same.  Because he's got pictures with every member of the band.  Just not together.  He wants that group shot because he says it's tough to get. 
[03:49:30]  But so we're sitting down and we're down there at the lobby.  We all waited in the lobby.  I was just there to watch what happened because I wanted to see if he freaked out.  I wanted to be there for it.  You were there, what, just to see it?  Or were you going to try to jump in?  Well, I was going to try to hopefully see Lars or Kirk and go, hey, Lars, hey, man, what's going on?  Because they know me.  And then go, you know, and James kind of does too.  But just go, hey.  And then all of a sudden, if they all came out together and go, hey, Lars, I got a friend here. 
[03:50:00]  Could we get a group picture real quick?  Could you get the band right here?  Right.  Just for a second.  And so I was hoping to do that.  That was my plan.  And if you ask him, and it's a familiar face, and you're saying for one shot with my friend Jim.  The camera's right here.  He's right there.  And you have to imagine at least one of them know Jim by face.  Oh, yeah.  You're a comedian, right?  Well, we're all waiting there.  Jim was getting, and he was, Opie used the word spiraling.  He was spiraling down there.  It was getting worse and worse as the minutes ticked on.  Because he was going, people were coming up, and he was asking everybody he could, can you help me with this? 
[03:50:30]  And he's texting his management while he's in the lobby.  And when I came into O&A to give him the update, it was when one of the guys had come back saying, look, I'm trying.  I don't want to be a bad guy, but we're going to try.  And I don't want to be a bad guy if it doesn't happen.  And that's the moment where you're like, oh, no.  That's not a good thing to hear.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was very tense out there.  Yeah.  A lot of negativity before we knew the final conclusion. 
[03:51:00]  I did.  I was talking to him, and he goes, I go, what's your feeling on this?  And he goes, I already know.  I already know what's going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  It's not happening.  I have to play it out.  I have to play it out, but it's not going to happen.  I was trying to pump up.  I'm like, I got a good feeling about this.  Did you have a good feeling about it?  I did.  I did.  I thought they would all come out together for some reason.  I thought that there would be.  Well, it's close quarters.  I thought there would be one little quick photo op in front of that serious banner where  some big executive goes, hey, can we get a quick picture of you guys in front of our 
[03:51:30]  banner, even though they got it at the Harlem Theater last week or Saturday.  The problem started when we realized that all the band was in Howard's wing hanging out.  Yeah.  And there were people in management here were going into his wing.  Like they were going into Howard's area.  And Jim saw that.  Wow.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Because then.  Yeah.  Because then you don't have to wait for him out in the lobby.  They're free to go once they hit the lobby. 
[03:52:00]  Now, I didn't notice, but the more people that were like lingering in the lobby, and they  weren't even all there for Metallica.  Like there was some rapper there for Shade 45.  But as more people started lingering in the lobby, did that make Jim more uneasy?  No, he didn't mention that.  But I noticed it.  I'm like, now it's getting a little crowded in here.  Jim was just singularly focused.  It was funny because there was Metallica's like security.  There was two guys by Howard's door where Metallica was behind.  And they were just looking at, they were the club soda Kenny's.  Right. 
[03:52:30]  Because Kenny was with Jim.  And I'm like, Kenny, you see those two guys over there?  I go, they're looking at me and Jim like we could be a problem.  Like you look at people when O&A are walking out, go, all right, those two creeps over there  could be a problem.  I need to watch their moves when the van comes out.  Like I'm going to block them out.  Yeah.  And he's like, he goes, I know, I see them.  Because they kept looking over.  I go, let's just see what these guys are going to do.  Do you think Kenny could do something?  Like go up to those guys since they're of the same ilk and be like, hey, these are my  guys.  I know you're here with your guys.  You know, Jim made that decision to don't go to the security and say, can we get a picture? 
[03:53:00]  Because they usually will say no.  Right.  You don't want to get cockblocked.  You'd rather do it in the moment.  Right.  Don't give any advance notice.  Well, I guess we'll get to the conclusion.  Because all the audience knows so far is that Jim Norton is not in the building.  Because what happened was, we were down in the lobby.  You were ready.  Kenny was ready.  I was watching.  I was just there to observe.  And we saw some commotion.  And people started coming out of Howard's wing.  And there was Kirk.  He came out first.  And Kirk came out. 
[03:53:30]  And he turned the corner.  And he walked into the elevator bank.  And he went downstairs.  He said hi to Annabella.  Well, yeah.  But he didn't say.  But then it's over.  And that was it.  Yeah, because I think Roland was saying.  Did you see.  Was Jim mad that Kirk said hello to Annabella?  And I'm like.  He didn't even notice that.  Because as soon as he saw Kirk come out himself.  He knew it was over.  He was deflated.  It didn't matter.  It didn't matter if he talked to some homeless guy for five minutes. 
[03:54:00]  He knew it was over.  And just like that.  And the real problem for Jim, too.  Is that he.  Like there's nobody.  Well, I guess he could blame people for not helping him earlier.  Like his management or whatever.  But it's easier.  I would think it'd be easier for him.  When there's somebody he can be mad at who said no to him.  But the fact is that Kirk just walked out and went downstairs.  Because he was like.  I'm done here.  Just the cars you dealt.  You never knew.  Right.  Yeah.  Nobody.  Nobody blew him off from the band.  But Jim's not looking to meet them individually.  I know.  He needs them all together.  Yeah.  He's got.  I got the whole band in separate pictures. 
[03:54:30]  I'm okay with that.  Because you could put them in like a picture frame with like the four photos in one frame.  Or just separate.  Put them separate next to each other.  Like all across.  You know.  I got all the Sabbaths separate too.  I know Jim's got the original Sabbath together.  He's got that picture.  But you know what?  It's not.  I don't know.  You know.  That's when you're getting.  You're at another level.  You're like.  Well now I need the whole band together.  Right.  It's like.  It's very rare that's going to happen.  One time on our show.  That metal show.  Rob Halford was taping the early show.  And then there's another show we tape right after. 
[03:55:00]  We do two in one day.  And Lemmy was doing the next show.  Uh huh.  And Lemmy and Halford were talking together.  I'm like.  That'd be a fucking amazing picture.  Yeah.  And I wound up getting it.  I go.  Hurry up.  And I said.  Can I get up quick.  So that's a cool picture.  Like.  You know.  Lemmy from Motorhead.  And Rob Halford from Judas Priest together.  And I also got Sammy Hagar.  With.  Lars.  Oh.  Because Lars did our show one time.  And Sammy was on the early show.  And they were talking.  I jumped in that one too.  And those are those things you're never going to get.  You're never going to.  Those guys are never together.  No.  And even.  And it has to be.  Like a press scenario. 
[03:55:30]  Like this.  Like they're here to do a radio show.  Or a TV show.  Because even if you get backstage.  Like they're all in different dressing rooms.  You know what I mean.  Like they're not all hanging out together.  Waiting to.  Take photos together.  And hitting up the snack bar together.  No.  You know what I mean.  Like they go on stage together.  And that's it.  I've been together for 30 years.  Yeah.  It's tough.  You've got to pick your spots.  I remember when I.  On Crank Angers.  I work with Eminem.  I went to Detroit to do phone calls in a studio.  And I was.  You did it like with him there?  With him there.  Yeah.  Side by side.  That's pretty amazing. 
[03:56:00]  I figured that they would have just had you.  No.  In some place in Jersey.  And then matched it up with his tape.  No.  We all.  We went out there.  Do you think that was his request?  It was his request.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  So you know.  Jimmy Kimmel at the time.  Adam Carolla.  Me.  Daniel Kellison.  Who was the executive producer of the show.  And a couple writers.  And me.  Went out there.  Because he requested.  He wanted to do phone calls.  With the characters that I did.  Bobby Fletcher and Special Ed.  Oh.  That's great.  He's a diehard fan too.  Huh?  He's a diehard fan of you guys.  For the Crank Angers.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I remember Jimmy Kimmel saying that.  Oh yeah.  Did you get a photo with him in the studio?  Well that's what I told the guys. 
[03:56:30]  The writers.  I go look.  Here's my camera.  Yeah.  Fucking.  I want a picture with it.  And I go look.  We're not even going to go there.  About taking a picture with Eminem.  I go.  Well at least you need to snap pictures.  While we're sitting together.  Doing phone calls.  That's the trick.  Because we always.  You know.  So I said.  At least do that.  So I got that.  And I.  Whenever I saw the camera up.  I'd always mug for it.  Like.  And you see.  I got pictures of Eminem.  Not even looking.  But I'm like.  I got this big grin on my face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  Like.  Whenever I'm.  I'm doing like interviews with wrestlers.  Or whatever.  I don't always want to stop them.  To get a picture afterwards. 
[03:57:00]  But I just say.  I try to bring like an extra person.  Or I give somebody a camera too.  And go.  Just take a photo.  While the interview is happening.  Yeah.  Or.  Like Eric will come with me.  And like.  After the interview.  I'll be like.  Oh.  Thanks for doing that.  Thanks for doing that.  And I'll get Eric.  Or if my wife is going with me.  I'll make my wife say it.  Go.  Oh.  Can we get one for the website of you too?  And I'll go.  All right.  Yeah.  Sure.  You know.  Yeah.  You know.  So you don't look like a douche bag.  Absolutely.  But I guess when you're.  Like.  When you're hosting that metal show.  They don't mind taking photos of you. 
[03:57:30]  I just do it right before the show.  Yeah.  I try to get them before.  In the green room.  I go in.  I go.  Hey.  I'm Jim.  One of the hosts.  You know.  It's going to be great.  We're glad to have you.  I go.  Can I get a quick picture real quick.  And just get it out of the way.  Yeah.  You know.  But you don't have to say.  We're going to put it on social media.  Or something like that.  No.  No.  I just go.  Can I get one.  So.  I don't care.  They're cool about that.  Where they.  They don't mind if I bother the guests before the show.  But. 
[03:58:00]  That's good.  Yeah.  So.  But that was my backup.  I go.  All right.  If he's not going to take one.  At least if I'm sitting next to him.  Yeah.  That's good enough.  Yeah.  I went in there going that way.  I'm not going to be bummed out.  I didn't bother Kimmel and Carolla.  Go.  Dude.  I got to get a picture.  Like I knew.  All right.  I'm just going to hope this works out.  But.  Right.  Yeah.  You'd like to think that if you're sitting there recording next to the dude.  As long as you get that photo of you two recording together.  Good enough.  Yeah.  And it's honestly.  A picture of you recording something with Eminem.  He's probably better than standing photo op or whatever. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  Jim was not happy when he came in here.  He was depressed.  Is it for bad for him?  Like he wasn't.  That's why I didn't even ask him to stick around for the show.  He just wanted to go.  He's got still an outside shot.  I heard that they're in town for a couple more days.  There's a private screening tomorrow for their movie.  Just family and friends that agents and managers are trying to get him in.  That doesn't mean they're all four going to together take a picture.  Right.  But for family and for.  So.  There's still an out.  He'll just be sitting through that movie.  Just thinking about the photo. 
[03:59:00]  You should have seen him with Tony Danza in here.  Poor Tony Danza.  I was here.  I didn't want to walk out at the same time.  Yeah.  Because Tony goes, oh, Metallica's here.  And Jim stormed out.  So when Tony took a look at Anthony, then I went around him to see, all right, now this  guy's leaving too.  The whole interview, he was sitting there like he'd be looking at Tony, but then he'd  just be looking out in the hall.  Like he'd just be looking through the window the whole time.  He was.  It was.  And Norton's usually very engaged in the interviews.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  That's his thing.  But he was totally out of it for this one.  And then when it was time to go wait in the lobby for Metallica, Norton left. 
[03:59:30]  And then I left to go see what he was doing.  And then you left to join him.  So literally like half the studio cleared out.  I was here to try to hope to get that picture for Jim any way I could stop one of those  guys.  That was my goal.  Yeah.  So I had to walk out.  I didn't want to ruin it for him where Lars didn't know who he was and they were all walking  out together.  If I could stop one of them and get them together.  But it didn't happen.  It did not happen.  I was hoping that the ONA weren't going to get mad at me for leaving the studio. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, dude.  ONA are so aware of how good this is going to be.  Like they want as many eyes on what's going on with Norton as possible.  I hate reality shows, but how fucking that would have been the greatest reality show  of people filming Jim and all that going down the tension and then also filming Metallica's  crew.  Like who are those fucking guys over there to keep looking?  They're going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Like what's going on over there?  Because it definitely was.  They kept looking around the corner.  When you came up here, the door was wide open and you see flashbulbs going off inside 
[04:00:30]  the power compound.  It would just be such a funny.  You're right.  It would be a great reality show because half of it would be Norton getting flown out to L.A.  to do the Tonight Show and fans stopping and try to get a picture with him and all this  stuff.  And then you'd see the complete other half where he isn't even aware of any kind of fame  and he's just another groveling like, I'm just trying to get a picture.  You know what I mean?  I know.  Like he's not.  Yeah.  There's no ego because he just, the only thing that's important in that moment, I'm just 
[04:01:00]  trying to get a picture.  Yeah.  It'd be great.  It'd be great.  It would be.  It's, you know.  Do we have to, is it time, Eric?  You're past the time.  All right.  So play, play it until, uh...  You still got to read to do.  Oh, shit.  Hey.  I got to run because I got to get back home.  Yeah, man.  Get out of here.  I'm just going to read this and then we're going to play...  I want to do your podcast, though.  Let's hopefully do it within the next week or so.  Yeah, definitely.  Just text me whenever, whenever you want to.  Yeah.  And we'll do it.  It'll be fun.  I just can't do it today because I could do, got to run. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  I would definitely, I'm not blowing you off.  Cool, man.  No, no, no.  I trust you.  Get out of here.  All right.  Would you eat a fake apple made from fillers and preservatives?  I don't think so.  What about a meatball made that way?  Well, like most people, you want to be able to pronounce every ingredient that goes into  your food.  If you cook at home, you use real, fresh ingredients.  If you don't have time to cook from scratch, Mama Mancini's Meatballs is the answer for you.  Mama Mancini's starts with 100% USDA-graded domestic beef for their meatballs and all natural 
[04:02:00]  ingredients, like genuine Pecorino Romano cheese, onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, eggs, and a little  salt and pepper.  Real ingredients.  That's it.  Mama Mancini's famous slow-cooked Italian sauce is made just as simply as their meatballs.  They start with whole Italian plum tomatoes.  They crush them and then add natural seasonings.  Mama Mancini's adds their meatballs to the simmering slow-cooked sauce for the perfect  combination of flavors.  Since 1921, Mama Mancini's has never veered from Grandma Mancini's original recipe. 
[04:02:30]  Real ingredients just taste better.  Mama Mancini's slow-cooked Italian sauce and meatballs now available at your local supermarket.  And I'm going to tell you this.  If these are the meatballs of choice for Roland Campos, then they'll be good enough for you  too.  Is that right, Roland?  You betcha.  How much time do we have?  Is it worth playing a little bit of the song or no?  We can do about four minutes of the five.  Really?  Yeah.  All right. 
[04:03:00]  Let's do that.  And it's Sad But True, correct?  Yes.  All right.  This, as we leave you, poor Jim was not able to accomplish his mission of getting the Metallica  group shot because Kirk came out first and then got in the elevator and went home.  That's that.  I'm sure more on this tomorrow when Jim will be back on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Until then, enjoy Sad But True from the Sirius XM Metallica concert at the Apollo.  Goodbye.
