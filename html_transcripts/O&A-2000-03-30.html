<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a whirlwind of chaotic events, profanity, and sexually explicit content.  It began with the hosts in a jovial mood, quickly turning to boasts and threats of violence against rival radio personalities, potentially escalating to a physical confrontation near the Brooklyn Diner.  A caller, Ernie, reported hearing their “Britney Spears bit” imitated on another station. Internal office conflict arose over mailbox consolidation, adding to the day's frustrations.  The hosts then detailed their significant stock market losses, a recurring theme throughout the broadcast, amplified by a conversation with a despondent stockbroker, “Trader Jake,” who described the market as a "disaster."

A listener contest for the "most offensive song" ran concurrently, fueled by calls from Stacy and Vinny.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls regarding hair removal in the genital area (“taint”), with graphic and explicit descriptions of various methods and personal experiences.  Caller Paris shared a bizarre story about witnessing her attorney’s sexually suggestive massage at a spa.  Opie recounted his day in court, which included witnessing a man suffer a heart attack and admiring his wife's attractive lawyer.  He concluded by threatening to "smash" his computer.

The show continued with the hosts destroying keyboards to relieve stress, immediately followed by Anthony receiving a call about a $19,000 debt (implied to be from the IRS), leading to further keyboard destruction and panicked reactions.  Lewis Black's pre-recorded ad aired during this chaos.  Listeners called in with absurd solutions to their financial problems.  A discussion ensued about an article linking finger length to homosexuality, prompting a humorous "gay test" on studio guests, declaring Earl to have “gay hands.”  This led to further discussion of Earl's perceived homosexuality.

A segment focused on perceived homosexual subtext in *The Road to El Dorado*, with crude commentary from the hosts and Earl. This was followed by complaints about a significant fecal matter incident in the bathroom, culminating in the unexpected appearance of Gray Wolf, a homeless man they had previously assisted. Gray Wolf played a flute and discussed his diet, including "beef tripe with white rice."  The show included giveaways of Mets tickets, played a panned unreleased Metallica song ("I Disappear"), and featured crude jokes about Celine Dion’s anatomy.  Stockbroker Dave called in with financial advice and humorous banter.  The broadcast ended with a shocking revelation: an uninvited man, Kevin, a listener, had walked into the studio through an unlocked door, prompting serious concerns about building security.

The next segment opened with the fallout from the security breach, featuring Kevin's explanation of his actions and the hosts' apology for their initial overreaction.  A cease-and-desist letter from Hollywood Records demanding they stop playing the unreleased Metallica song dominated the discussion.  This was followed by listener calls, internal conflicts including yelling at a staff member, Ben, and reiteration of the hosts’ individual $19,000 debts.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, featuring humorous and sarcastic reflections on the day's chaotic events, continuing the themes of homosexuality, genitalia, and listener-shared mishaps.  The overall tone remained one of escalating absurdity and frantic energy throughout the broadcast.

[00:04:00]  Be good  Alright, man  Bye  Bye  Excuse me  God, and then I'm having an argument with Pete  What's the problem?  Oh, yeah, they want to take our mailboxes away  Something equally as ridiculous as that  Pete is spending the day rearranging the mailboxes here at NEDA  Rearranging the mailboxes  Rearranging the mailboxes  And for some reason, there's not enough mailboxes  So they want to double us up and triple us up  Like, the Opie and Anthony show will get one mail slot 
[00:04:30]  Yeah  I'm getting 10,000 magazines I never ordered on a daily basis  With the junk mail Anthony's getting, I don't want to share a mailbox with my bud  Is that a good thing?  No  So we're like, um, no  Let's speak our peace here  And then Pete's like, well, every other show has just one mailbox  Huh? What?  What the, who, who the, what the  Well, when every other show has the ratings we have for NEW  Then they could have separate mailboxes for each member of the show 
[00:05:00]  Exactly  Give us something around here  Give us just a little something  Now they're taking our mailboxes away from us  We don't ask for much around here  No  We will not be sharing mailboxes  Oh, my God  Simple solution, make a few more mailboxes  If you're running out of room  Yeah  Well, yeah  It's not too hard  Oh, my God  What a, what a day  What a day 
[00:05:30]  Not only is the stock not named Yippie  Just dumping  I know  I saw that  I had some kind of announcement  And said that there was a problem  Like they're being looked into for some kind of consumer issues  So, boom  Ten points right off of that  There you go  So there goes my $600  So the $600  That I gave you  That you gave me to invest  Is now worth about, ah, $250  $250?  Yeah, maybe three  I just, just swiped in half 
[00:06:00]  At the drop of a hat  Uh, Trader Jake, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, man, how are you?

A fourth day of NASDAQ being in the crapper?

[00:24:00]  What is it  Some kind of a sugary substance  It kind of looks like  It's almost the same  Kind of liquid  That they would use  In shaving  I mean in waxing  Except it's  All natural substance  And they just  It looks like  Like molasses  And  Yes  Just like molasses  And they just put it on  And they rub it a little bit  And rip it right off  Lift your leg up like this  Yeah  Yeah, you're kind of a contortionist  And then rip it off  And they just pull it right off  Can you still go get that done somewhere?

Your grandmother's probably a lovely woman  And she was named Margaret  Back when Margaret was like a hottie name for a woman  Like Mildred  You know what?

[00:33:00]  With like bath salts and stuff  My skin gets like really moist  And then they have  Shading gel for girls and stuff  So I use that  And then I put like lotion on  Like that smells really good  Like pears or raspberries or something  My friend Brandon really likes that  And how do you get rid of it, though?  I use like a disposable razor  Like right after  With the shaving gel  Yeah  And that works really well 
[00:33:30]  If you soak  Like if you get your skin really moist  That really works really well  Get your skin real moist  Very good, okay  Wow  That's pretty nice  And you do the shaving in the bathtub  With your legs up in the air or what?  Yeah, basically  Yeah  That's right  And it looks all nice down there  Besides just the hair  It doesn't look like an explosion  At a kosher deli  No?  I have a friend named Brandon  And he seems to really like it  Yeah?  All right, Juliana  Thanks for just calling  And acting all sexy and stuff 
[00:34:00]  Bye  That's good  Let's go to Valerie  Hi, Valerie  Hi  How are you?  Fine  Good, what's up?  You use  You know those buzzers  That you guys use to do your sideburns?  Yeah  Like when you go to a bottle shop  You don't  When you use the razor  It itches when it goes back  Yeah  And when you use this  It's a clean cut  No problems  No itches  Yeah, you gotta shave  One of those little  Little sideburn razors or something  Yeah  And it's perfect 
[00:34:30]  It's smooth  You can shape it if you want  No itches when it goes back  Nothing  Yeah, but  Does that go bare?  What?  That doesn't really get it bare though  Yeah, you can get really close with those  No, you can get completely  Yeah  It's not even close  You can get completely bare  Maybe I need it  I do  It's funny to watch you ladies in the shower  Shaving yourself  It's very entertaining  Do you watch?  Yeah, man  Do you remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah  The window's behind us  The window's behind us  We watch the girls shower all the time  We haven't done it lately 
[00:35:00]  Because the show's been busy  But yeah, right around 5.30  All these showers behind me  Outside the window here  Are filled with women  That are shaving themselves  And taking showers  Well, if you guys did more  Well, what are they shaving themselves with?  Yeah  It's funny  The one girl lifts her leg  All the way up in the air  Like she's a ballerina  And then she takes the razor to town  Yeah, but you see  When you use the buzzer  You don't even got to do that  You can just stand up in the shower  You don't need cream  Soap nothing  That's great  I saw her slip once  When she had a leg up there  Near the window  And she stuck to the window 
[00:35:30]  Like one of those Garfield cats  In the car  It's pretty cool  Pretty fun to watch  All right  Well, thank you, Valerie  Okay  Bye  Let's go to Michelle  Michelle, you're next  On WNW  How are you?  Hi, this is what I do  If you're really close  To your boyfriend, Veronica  I have him get the shaver  And shave me  After I get out of the shower  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  Like we'll sit there  After we get the shower  So the hair's nice and moist 
[00:36:00]  Well, he'll just get the electric shaver  And shave me  And it gets really close  And he shaves your taint  And everything  Everything  Everything?  Everything  Wood floor  Just  Everything  Just  Everything  I remember when  Mary used to shave  Okay, Michelle  Thank you  Thank you  Bye  Shave it bolder than  Mary's head  Right, Mary? 
[00:36:30]  Look, Lou's got wood  Hey, Lou  Jolene  Hey  Hey  How are you, Jolene?  Great  Good  I have been doing this  For a long time  When I first started  I used to use a buzzer  And you can get your skin  Caught in between the little teeth  And really cut yourself bad  It's not comfortable  Oh, cut yourself  Yes  The best thing I have found to do  Is that Summer's Eve makes like a feminine wash  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  How about that? 
[00:37:00]  You want your little dinky with that  Nice  When you're in the shower  You turn the head away  You soak up  Get really lathered up  Summer's Eve  I use the Sensor Excel for women  Yeah  Brand new  It has to be super sharp  So you don't, like, get a dull neck  Right  You just do a little squat  In the shower  You feel yourself where the hair is  And you shave gently  It gets all the hair  I've never cut myself  It's the best way  A vag is like a Lamborghini  It's always got to be in the shop for something 
[00:37:30]  You know?  It's like very high maintenance  Very high maintenance  A guy's junk is like a Dodge Dart  You know?  It just keeps going  It just keeps running  It doesn't matter  It's dirty  You can beat the hell out of it  It'll still get the job done  It doesn't matter  Right  Keep dancing it  Who cares?  A special badge doctor and everything  You know?  You're so lucky you're not us  A different color side panel  It don't matter  Yeah, we don't care  Yeah, a different color side panel 
[00:38:00]  A vinyl roof is ripped  Who cares?  Who's still driving?  I mean, it does the job  It gets you from point A to point B  It may not look good  But it gets the job done  It works  That's all you got to worry about  All right, Julian  Thank you  Thanks, bye  All right, bye  Thank you  Thank you very much  Princess Summer's Eve  Pre-mixed, pre-measured, disposable douche  Who's going to keep them?  Oh, of course they're disposable  Paris  Hi  Hi  I just wanted to tell you that 
[00:38:30]  I just started listening to you guys  About two months ago  Yes  And I'm like hooked  Oh, cool  Really?  Okay  Hey, what were you listening to before us?  Can I tell you?  I never listened to talk radio before in my life  No?  This isn't really talk radio, though  I just, well, you know, it's thick radio  Yeah  I was, um, what's your, um, what's your, um, what's your ethnic background?  I'm black  Ah, see, oh, I could pick it out  Really?  Are you serious?  Yeah  My boyfriend always says I talk like a white girl  He's like, yeah, but they won't be able to get it  You do, but no, no, right there, I heard another word of that 
[00:39:00]  You can tell  Really?  Are you a cafe latte?  Really?  What you would call butter pecan, yes  Butter pecan, that's my favorite  Wait till you hear, wait till you hear what I have to tell you guys  All right  This whole shaving thing happened  Okay, one night, I'm in the music business  And I'm hanging out with my attorney  I've known him for, like, five years  He has Jerry Curl down there?  Ew  You know, it's himself  Check this out  He's like, okay, next door there's a place where you can go and get massages, pedicures, manicures 
[00:39:30]  And they stay open really late  It's really cold  Okay  Do you want to go hang out there?  And at first I felt weird doing something like that with my attorney  Because it just was weird  But anyway, to make a long story short  I get over there  And first the lady offers me to sit in the, what do you call it, the steam bath  So we're sitting in there hanging out, cracking jokes, laughing  Okay, so we go to get the massages  I don't want to get naked  Because, you know, this is my attorney  Right  So I have my, you know, undergarments on  I'm laying there getting massaged  And I just have my eyes closed  I looked over to the left of me 
[00:40:00]  And this guy is, like, ass naked  Okay  Really?  Okay, so he's naked, right?  But this is the clincher  I'm like, okay, I can deal with this  My friend's always saying, you're such a prude  So I'm like, okay, I'll sit here and I'll just take it  I'll never come back  But I'll just sit here and act cool  So I'm closing my eyes  I kind of drifted off  I wake up, no lie  I look over  These two Asian women are above him, on the table  Giving him  Yankee Cranky  It's the Yankee Cranky place  I didn't know that 
[00:40:30]  And he didn't even tell me  And I was mortified  I didn't even know what to do  Because I'm laying in the same room with this guy  Virgin  Virgin  Yeah  How stupid was I?  That's the Yankee Cranky  He was getting the Yankee Cranky  And you were sitting there watching, huh?  But I'm his client  I didn't watch  You're right  Well, first of all, I laid there  And I kind of, like  I was like, oh my God  What do I do now?  I was not turned on in the least  If that was his ultimate goal  It made me want to throw up right on his shoes  Oh, really?  Yeah, I freaking ran out  I grabbed my towel  He's like, are you okay? 
[00:41:00]  Mind you, he had a big belly  And he had some nappy hairs going on in the pubes  I was not feeling that  Nappy  Nappy  Nappy trappy  See, if a white guy uses the word nappy  We get in trouble  Hey, let me tell you  They were making some egg drop soup  It was nasty  So you guys left the place  And what did you talk about?  I left and he was like, how  Well, are you all right?  And I was like, what the hell?  That's nice taking you there  And I tell you, I had no idea what to say 
[00:41:30]  And to this day, we've never really discussed it  I just was like, it caught me off guard  I didn't want to seem like I was like a  I don't know  Out of a good person  Yeah, there you go  Right  But it was really gross  Maybe if he was hotter  It wouldn't have been  All right, Paris  Okay  We would love to check you out  We love checking out our black listeners  Well, maybe one day I can pop light  I'm not bad looking at all  Soul sister  Yeah  We like soul sisters  Well, we can arrange that one day  Yeah?

[00:43:30]  I'm sorry  I know I use so much of your time  But you know how you play, you know, old sketches in the first hour?  I don't know what you're talking about  We're here too  We're here live too  I know, I know  Like I said, we're here  Well, when you're on vacation  Yeah  Could you guys try to play the one  I don't remember if it was Opie or Anthony's brother was in  You're talking about the bath  Oh, my brother Brett  He's mortified with that story  Oh my God  And he tried to give himself oral favors when he was like seven or eight  And he was able to do it 
[00:44:00]  And then his mom walked in on him  And he had to try to convince his mom that he wasn't gay  Yeah  He was doing that  And he wanted to receive it, not give it  But since you're doing it yourself, you're doing both  Well, and it's crucial to the story that my mom knocked on the door  And my brother Brett didn't answer  So she figured like he drowned in the bathtub  So she broke down the door basically  And Brett was receiving or giving  Both  Both pretty much  With his head under the water  Under the water  That's why he didn't hear my mom knocking on the door  He was trying to breathe through his own snorkel 
[00:44:30]  His water was like up above his ear  Oh, yeah  So then like my mom goes running down the hall  Screaming  Freddie, Brett's gay  And my brother Brett's running after her completely naked  No, I wanted to receive it  I didn't want to give it  Right  Trying to convince my mom that he's not gay  What a fun house over there  I hope his house must have been  I'll tell you one thing  My brother Brett is the funniest guy in my family  Carnival  He's got stories that will make you cry  You'll laugh so hard  All right  Some good radio

[00:46:00]  Another great band in South East Bay  Hey, do we still have those filter tickets to give away?  Cool, we have more filter tickets to give away  Doing that all week long for you  Doing that all week long for you  Filter playing with Veruca Stahl  April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom  We have your tickets  Hey, there was one high point in my day  Over at the courthouse there  Oh, you went to...  Wait, you went to court today?  Oh, yeah  Why do you think I was late?  Oh  Yeah  Then I didn't notice that 
[00:46:30]  You were late and then he came in  Oh, you didn't notice?  No, not at all  You didn't notice me coming in with three cigarettes  Poking in my head, drinking a beer  No, I did not notice at all  Yeah, sure  Oh  Yeah, one highlight in the courtroom  A guy was having a heart attack  What?  Yeah  A real heart attack?  I think so  We're all sitting there  In the courtroom  And this guy just starts going  Like puking and drooling 
[00:47:00]  And they give him his heart medication  And then the EMS guys came in  And hauled him out of there  He didn't like his settlement either  I guess not  I was next  I was doing the same thing  But it wasn't my heart  Yeah  Yeah, they had to take him right out  No kidding  Do you know why he was in court?  I don't know  I think we were all in there  For the same fun reason  Really?  I think it was all the same thing, you know 
[00:47:30]  Well, I know  You reminded me of like  When I was like 12 years old  I come from a really big family  And when Daddy came home from work  In a really bad mood  And Mom  You want to stay away from him  And Mom had to go around to all the kids  And go  You guys behaved  Daddy had a bad day  Daddy's in a bad mood  Daddy's in a bad mood  So  And now I came in the office  I'd like throw the jacket down  I'm psychomarked  Get out of my chair  So I'm whispering  I'm all nasty  I'm whispering to everyone  Anthony is usually in a good mood  Ladies and gentlemen 
[00:48:00]  But I think he's a little pissed off today  So let's not aggravate Anthony  Good thing no one came in  To one of those dopey  Like meet and greets  Like they're always dragging people  Into our office  Yeah  I'm convinced  The only reason they haven't  Dragged anybody by to meet us  Is because they don't know  Where the goddamn  Our office is anymore  Mm-hmm  Oh  Yeah, so that was fun  Guy having a little heart episode  Um, and  In the courtroom  Yeah  I just feel like you need  To get some aggression out  Why?  Why?  I'm fine  Why?

[01:40:30]  with his very short  index finger  I think in one of the papers  it said it was only  for the lesbians  actually  it really didn't have  anything to do with the guys  yeah it was for  salad sisters  oh yeah  well that happened  well that was  a waste of time  we all took the test  and your stepfather  is on the line  Sal  hey Sal  you're not yelling  at me are you  no  no yelling  this is going to be  an easy one  okay

[01:53:30]  Virgin.  Virgin.  Virgin.  It wouldn't be the Opiates Anthony show without a mix from Ant Boy Slim.  Oh, my God.  Earl, that finger's a little rough there.  It's a gay. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Someone's saying you guys should make black Urkel.  Urkel.  Urkel.  Yeah, Urkel.  Urkel.  Urkel.  Urkel, Earl.  Whatever.  Oh, just like Urkel?  Yeah.  Just like...  Oh, boy, look at my gay man.  Urkel.  Well, there you go, Earl.  You're gay.  Paper says it.  It must be true.  Yeah, it's in the Post.  You know that?  You've got to believe everything you read in the Post. 
[01:54:30]  You're gay.  Okay, terrific.  Tom from Teaneck, New Jersey writes,  Who is gayer, Earl or his husband?  Earl swings both ways, boys and men.  Did you expect the finger difference to be that drastic?  Not that drastic.  That's pretty drastic. 
[01:55:00]  That is funny.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's up today?  What's going on, fellas?  How are you?  I was just talking to my friend Johnny Cochran,  and you know what he told me?  Huh?  If the glove fits.  Yeah?  That fit?  What?  What's the end of the quote?  You don't have a joke, do you?  No.  All right.  At least you're honest.  We like that.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  Bye, pal.  Bye.  So, there you go.  We accomplished something on the show already today,  and we've proven that Earl is indeed gay. 
[01:55:30]  Okay, terrific.  This just in, Ant, Doug from Jersey.  Earl is the new president of NAMBLA.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  That little finger.  We're going to have to change the name of the Stephen Lynch tune to If I Were Earl.  Earl likes man-ass. 
[01:56:00]  Coming in.  Earl's a kid toucher.  Call Earl the Earl of buttocks.  Let's see what Antoine wants.  Antoine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Earl's gay.  Terrific.  Oh, gay.  Terrific.  Earl's gay.  Terrific.  I like that.  That's all I got to say about that.  That's beautiful.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Peace.  Peace.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve has a theory here, I believe.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas? 
[01:56:30]  How you doing?  Great.  Yeah, Earl's not gay, man.  No?  No, these black people.  They have what they call a chimpanzee chromosome.  Oh, stop it.  Holy cow.  He's inappropriate, Gong.  I apologize to my, uh, to our African listeners there.  There's a lot of hatred out there.  I apologize to our colored listeners.  Oh, my God.  A lot of, a lot of hatred. 
[01:57:00]  Uh, Jack from the City writes, uh, Jay Moore has a strong pimp hand.  Black Earl has a strong gay hand.  Oh, someone warning me.  Uh, Anthony, don't touch that bell.  Earl molested it with his homo hand.  Earl, Jack.  Do you have anything to say, Earl?  The evidence is coming in pretty strong.  Hmm. 
[01:57:30]  No, I don't.  You sure?  I choose the remains.  Could we just see the hand again?  Yeah.  One last look at the hand.  No, the other hand.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What?  Wait a minute.  Now, Andy, you've played.  You know how many times I've busted this hand?  Playing sports.  Playing baseball.  Playing basketball.  Sports.  Is that what you call it?  Oh, stop it.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  Thanks, Earl.  You want me to finish?  What?  What?  What?  I'm going to defend the test against the post?  The index finger has to be a little shorter.  Right, Earl?  That way it touches the most sensitive part of another man's...  Oh!  I hope he's gagging.  That's funny.  I needed a good laugh today.  Right, Scott? 
[01:58:30]  What's Earl, Scott?  Virgin.  Yeah.  Earl, are you a butt virgin?  Oh, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  All right.  Well, we'll get into the controversy over this movie next, I guess.  Oh, right.  I forgot that's where we were going originally.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  El Dorado.  I can't wait till...  There's gay overtones in El Dorado.  Oh, that's where we were, right?  Yeah.  El Dorado.  You ever see that, Earl?  No.  New cartoon that came out.  All their fingers are a little shorter.  Their index finger.  Well, we could do it real fast.  They even drew them like that.  We could do it fast.  It's real fast.  A lot of people thinking that the new movie by DreamWorks, Disney flick, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Uh, that it's, uh, that the two main characters are gay in it.  The film, which follows the adventures of Tulio and Miguel... 
[01:59:30]  Tulio?  Tulio.  Right there.  The verdict's in.  Tulio and Miguel, two conmen buddies searching for the lost city of gold, features an erotically  charged massage...  Wait, they massage each other?  Yeah.  And a suggested sex scene between Tulio and his love interest, uh, Chell.  Wait, Chell, a guy?  Yeah.  And the two male leads, voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, uh, skinny-dipping  a hot spring together before scampering naked through the rainforest. 
[02:00:00]  Scampering.  Scampering.  If you're scampering naked, uh, yeah, another man.  Uh, with Miguel flashing what has to be the first naked male behind to be featured in  a mainstream animated movie.  Cartoon man-ass, Earl.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that cartoon man-ass.  That's what I like.  Yeah.  Cartoon man-ass.  Wow.  I gotta tell you, Bing.  Hey, you know, that's tight, that cartoon man-ass. 
[02:00:30]  Earl, you said that, uh, you broke your hand playing a lot of sports.  No, I didn't break my hand.  And that's the excuse for the index measure being drastically shorter.  I don't know.  Which means, according to the post, you're gay.  Well, Dave, on line eight, uh, wants to ask you, uh, did Earl break his hand pitching  or catching?  Yeah, what was it, Earl?  Pitching or catching?  Be honest. 
[02:01:00]  This is so wrong.  All right.  Could have been when he was switch hitting.  The only spot Earl played is hide the soul on me.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, horrific.  All right.  And that's it about El Dorado.  A couple wacky scenes there.  El Dorado.  Well, I saw the, uh, the trailer for that.  Yeah.  I saw the movies and I really didn't pick up on the whole, uh, gay angle.  No.  Just looked like they were kind of having fun because they're cartoons. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  But, uh, yeah.  Cartoon man ass thing.  Yeah.  Gay.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  And we'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie.  Boring.  Anthony.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spat.  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  All right.  A lot of people want to see, uh, Earl's hand on the unofficial website. 
[02:02:00]  So, uh, they're doing that in the back of the studio.  They're getting a picture of, uh, Earl's gay hand.  And they're also going to put a picture of the post article.  Send it off to Steve so you guys can judge for yourself.  Uh-huh.  Why are you taking pictures of us in the studio?  Yeah, Earl, what are you doing, man?  What is that, for your private collection at home?  Ah.  You need new spanking material?  What's that about?  No, we just don't have any good studio shots.  I need, uh, pictures of man-ass. 
[02:02:30]  So, all right.  You guys don't have good studio shots of, uh, Opie and Anthony, right?  No, the ones we have is, like, you with your swamp lip or, you know.  So why'd you pick the day where Ant and I are probably in the worst moods  of our lives?  Do you know what time I got up this morning?  6.30.  When was the last time I saw 6.30 in the morning?  I'll tell you.  When I was up from the night before and hadn't been to sleep yet.  Earl, do you realize I got a bill for $19,000 today?  Maybe today is not the day to take, uh, cute little studio shots of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Here, we'll give you one.  I'm not feeling too fun today.  Okay.  Okay.  Maybe tomorrow would be a better day for something like that.  Perhaps.  You're, you're $19,000?  Yeah.  At least I'm not gay.  No.  Yeah, it could be worse.  You could have that short gay hand.  Oh, yeah.  So maybe today is not the day to, you know, click pictures. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Who broke the no quenching rule?  I don't know.  I went in there.  Stinky, did you break the no quenching rule?  I went in there and smelt crunch.  I just smelt crunch.  And in all fairness, you know, Stinky, who's the clone of Spaz?  Yeah.  The government has already cloned humans and his name is Stinky?  Yeah.  Stinky doesn't smell anymore.  He just happened to have a bad day the first day he started on the job at the Open Anthony Show.  That sucks.  And now he's stuck with his bad nickname. 
[02:04:00]  Stinky.  Stinky.  But I got to, in all fairness for the kid, he doesn't stink anymore.  You know, we don't have much time in between breaks to take leaks.  So when we go in there, it's a two-second leak, and all of a sudden you just smell crunch.  We told everybody, no crunching in that bathroom.  No crunching.  I think it was the homeless guy.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Really.  You guys might remember Gray Wolf from the homeless shopping spree. 
[02:04:30]  Well, Keith, why didn't you bring Gray Wolf down here today?  Now the homeless guy just crunched in the bathroom.  That's what you smelled, Anthony.  We were on the way to Tavern on the Green to get something to eat, and we figured we'd stop in and say hi.  Get Gray Wolf in here.  Let's ask him if he crunched in our bathroom.  You took Gray Wolf to Tavern on the Green?  We were on the way.  Here comes Gray Wolf. 
[02:05:00]  Hey, Gray Wolf, talk into the mic.  Oh, yeah, man.  Hey, what's up, yo?  Gray Wolf, everyone.  How you doing?  Hi, everybody.  Hi, Gray.  New York City.  Yeah.  I really appreciate you for being there for me.  Especially for some special people, which I want to mention some names, if it's okay with the radio station. 
[02:05:30]  Why?  What are these other fellow street peoples?  No.  No?  My wife, which she appreciates, that very beautiful gift you guys made possible for my Christmas.  Yes.  Thank you to every one of you, and thank you, Barbara, for appreciating the carousel.  That's a little rocky, but she received a Furby and those few special gifts.  That was on the homeless shopping spree.  And the radio station of 102.7. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Made my Christmas really a special one.  Thank you, everyone.  All right.  Now, Gray Wolf.  Yeah.  How much fire water do you have today?  Yeah.  None.  None?  Not a drop.  Let me tell you something.  I'm smelling some booze.  No, you must be smelling somebody else.  Now, Gray Wolf.  You must be smelling somebody else.  Gray Wolf, how do you pay us back?  Huh?  You pay us back by...  By a very beautiful song.  No, you pay us back by taking the nastiest crunch in that...  In the bathroom.  Did you crunch in that bathroom?  Yes, I did.  All right.  Now we know where it came from. 
[02:06:30]  Homeless crunch.  You went in there and died to come there.  You must be ready.  Homeless crunch.  Homeless crunch.  Oh, God.  I'm getting...  I'm getting a little cramp on the back.  Gray Wolf, what have you been eating?  Rats?  No.  Cockroaches?  Eat them buffaloes.  Leavers.  She can't be yours.  She can't be my dear.  McDonald's from the garbage can?  Yeah.  What have you been eating?  What have you been eating?  What have you been eating?  What have you been eating?  What have you been eating?  What have you been eating?  What have you had in the past?  Beef tripe with white rice.  Beef tripe. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  That's a cow's stomach.  Cow's stomach and white rice.  But it was delicious, though.  Yeah, well, we could smell it.  Oh.  I hope you just sprayed...  Sprayed Lysol.  Beef, I'll say you're probably up to that.  That was great.  You were wonderful.  And I'm glad that we're not mentioning...  What?  What are you...  What is he showing us?  That girl that showed her...  To him, especially. 
[02:07:30]  We brought her all the way back from the Jersey...  The one from the bus, right?  Yeah.  On the bus.  You know that she's trying to communicate with me.  We got together again.  Communicate...  Smoke signals?  A cup of tea.  A cup of tea.  I'm in love with my wife and my daughter.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Right now, Barbara wants me to do a microphone.  Why are you moving your head around like Stevie Wonder?  Yeah.  Stay on the mic.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:08:00]  Why don't you play a little...  You got the flute?  You got the flute?  I have one song that I wanted to play for my little girl.  All right.  It's okay.  I want to do it on the air phone.  Sure.  It's something that was done for Michael Jordan in the movie Space Jam that we saw together.  Yeah.  I believe I can fly.  I believe I can fly as played.  Hold on to your steering wheels, kids.  It's on the hand-carved wooden flute thing that Grey Wolf is playing. 
[02:08:30]  I want to do it on the flute.  Okay.  I can believe I can fly.  Hold on a minute because my wife knows I always cry when I talk about personal stuff.  Can't pull it all back.  Love you, Barbara.  Me too.  And happy birthday, Ralph Caparelli.  I love you.  There you go.  You're my father-in-law.  Here it is.  Okay, terrific.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  That was, I believe, I can fly?  That was, yeah.  You guys are a great team.  I've been listening to your show for a while outside.  Oh, you guys, oh, God.  Nice.  Yeah, why don't you guys do a duet?  A little duet.  Come on.  A little duet.  Come on, Grey Wolf.  A little duet with it.  You know, Chariots of Fire?  Let's do it together.  You ready? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Now it's my turn.  I need the drum.  Hold on.  Okay, you got the drum?  Yeah, we're going to.  We need a guitar.  Here we go.  I would have loved to play something beautiful.  We can get the next show.  Guitar.  On the studio.  They rock these songs.  We check this night and record it.  Cherokee people. 
[02:10:00]  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Cherokee child.  Look at the clouds forming outside.  I know.  We're going to get some rain.  Yeah.  And that, we ain't even dancing.  They're only a Tom-Tom drunk.  They passed the peace pipe, will you?  Yo.  Yo.  Yeah.  Wow, he's going into his pocket.  You got some.  Yeah.  What you got, man?  What you got?  What is that?  The first gold wine.  Wampum. 
[02:10:30]  Made for the American Indian, the Cheyenne people.  Mom.  With the mommy and the baby.  And the eagle with its wings spread it open.  One dollar bill.  Ooh.  In pure gold.  For the year 2000.  I think it was...  Pure gold.  Man, I was wondering where Scotzo went.  No, but...  That's the Scotzo wasn't.  You told it.  Yeah.  You know they will not put a real...  It's a real coat.  Okay.  All right.  Virgin.  Let's get some juice.  Barbara, that's for you.  Okay.  That was great.  That was, you know. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  Nice jamming with you.  All right.  Hey, it's very good.  Have you sampled any of the fire water outside?  We have plenty of it.  No.  I see it.  I saw it on the table.  We have fire water and OJ, fire water and cranberry.  You are very great.  I mean...  Yes.  So excellent.  Okay.  I want to appreciate it.  Do you have any good stuff?  We high-flying spirit of radio.  Like, uh...  All right.  Let's hear it for Gray Wolf.  That was a good...  That was a good break.  Good segment.  Gray Wolf, you know what tribe is my favorite?  Welcome to New York City. 
[02:11:30]  The Hakawis.  I am.  Remember the Hakawis from F Trope?  Yeah.  That was F Trope.  Yeah.  They didn't know the heck where they were.  Right.  Right.  And they were always scheming with the guys in F Trope to make some money.  You know what his name was when the chief came out.  He says, what shall we call ourselves?  And they were like, where the heck are we?  Where the heck are we?  Oh, that's our name.  Right.  The Hakawis.  The Hakawis Indians.  Hakawis. 
[02:12:00]  Sergeant Iran.  I love that show.  Yeah.  Thank you so much for the papers you've done for me.  Right.  My family.  All right.  Okay.  This is beautiful.  Great.  Every now and then.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's good stuff.  Keith, thank you.  Okay.  You're welcome pal.  All right.  You're welcome my brother.  Okay.  Thank you all for listening.  Kathy Serrano. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  Which you are.  Joe Serrano.  Grey Wolf.  We'll just turn this mic down and continue with the show.  And Greg from Yonkers writes, hey Opie, don't bust a Grey Wolf.  You might be his neighbor soon.  Oh.  I'm not going that far.  What?  That's the Bronx.  I keep it real if my hand was close.  Right.  The iron.  Grey Wolf, do you have the gay hand?  Yeah.  Let's see if you have the gay hand.  I've been around that.  Hold your hand up like this.  No.  No. 
[02:13:00]  That's not a gay hand.  Oh, my gay hand.  You see my pinky kind of like separates me from all the other ones.  Yes.  And I will not choose my other hand.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes, of course.  You're all been listening.  You're wicked, man.  You're a wicked man.  Why is there all on the floor?  Oh, my God.  He does a great show.  I'm going to try to take your show over, so you do the talking.  We do a great show.  No, I'm not. 
[02:13:30]  No, I'm not.  Hey, I got an idea.  Have fun.  We do a great show.  Have an idea.  Let's go again.  Grey Wolf out of the studio.  All right, Grey Wolf.  All right.  I love you.  Let's go.  Grey Wolf, thank you for your song, and may peace fly above you like mighty hawk.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I'll rip it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was good stuff.  Me from the Bronx tribe. 
[02:14:00]  Thanks, Keith.  That's good stuff.  Always a pleasure.  Climbing the charts.  I believe I can fly.  Blade on whatever the hell that was.  He broke the note crunch and roll, and boy, did he break it.  Oh.  Was he?  Oh, my gosh.  That was homeless tripe from the garbage dump.  That was in his chair.  Tripe.  Yeah, tripe.  Where does a homeless guy find tripe? 
[02:14:30]  In the East River?  Maybe soup kitchen.  Soup kitchen?  Maybe.  All right.  That was almost as bad as yesterday.  I went into the private bathroom there?  Yeah.  Where you need a key for it and stuff?  Yeah.  Oh.  Remember how pissed I was?  This is the worst.  I don't understand what kind of slob does this.  You go into a stall, right?  Yeah.  You go into a stall and you're like, minding your own business.  What do you do the first thing you do when you go into a stall?  You have to look into the bowl, right?  I look into the bowl. 
[02:15:00]  Just a mess.  Just a mess.  Like a crime scene.  Yeah.  And the guy didn't flush.  What the hell was that about?  I hate that.  What, Ben?  You came in so pissed off.  I couldn't stop laughing at you.  You were so pissed.  And then I'm like, I was so pissed.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm not flushing it either.  I want other people to be as pissed as I was.  No, not my own whatever, but that stall.  I'm like, I ain't flushing that stall either.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  That is pretty bad.  You walk in there like, oh, God.  It's just an image that's stuck in your head.  That's horrible.  All right.  We got to take a break.  All the phone calls suck.  So everyone hang up and we'll try to get something else going on.  Hey, do we have some tickets to give away?  Yeah.  Mets and filters.  Oh, we have the Mets tickets still?  We have tickets to opening day, yeah.  How many can we give away?  Three, four packs.  All right.  We'll give away three, four packs right now.

[02:17:00]  Hey, do you want to get in more trouble?  We have to.  Why, why?  I got the new Metallica song.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  Every radio station in America trying to get a copy of this damn thing.  I got it.  I'd be into hearing it.  Yeah? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Ben, what's the deal on this song?  It's from the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack coming out.  No one has this amp.  No one.  Really?  The station that should have this.  They don't have the balls to play it.  Yeah.  I don't doubt it.  They're still getting trouble.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We really don't care, so.  All right, let's jam the new Metallica.  Thanks for that.  That was needed. 
[02:18:00]  What's it called?  It's called I Disappear from Mission Impossible 2, Ant.  Oh.  Pretty much no one has this in the entire country.  I'd like to hear some new Metallica.  I'm hearing it first on the Opie and Anthony show on WNAW.  The rock and roll talk show that it is.  Okay?  Yes.  Crank it up.  Let's check it out together.  I Disappear, Metallica.  Metallica.  1027 WNAW.  1027 WNAW.  And there you have it. 
[02:18:30]  1027 WNAW with the latest from Metallica.  I Disappear from the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack.  A song that no one is playing in the country.  No one, no one, no one.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, everyone's saying the song sucks.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of people say that.  You can't listen to a song once.  You've got to let it grow on you, especially Metallica.  Let's go to Alana.  Alana!  Hey, what's up?  You didn't like the Metallica song?  It sounds like all the other songs, man. 
[02:19:00]  Well...  It sounds like the Sandman song they have.  The Sandman song.  Well...  Sounds like a real Metallica aficionado.  It's a little different than that, but...  All right.  Well, we thought we'd share with you.  All right.  Smash or trash?  What is it?  What's up?  All right.  Thank you, Alana.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  You didn't like it, huh?  I think it's best as much as Mission Impossible 1.  Yeah.  I don't even know why they're making a Mission Impossible 2.  Well, people see it, I think. 
[02:19:30]  That...  Sequels never work below.  Except for, like, Austin Powers.  I don't buy Tom Cruise as, like, a good actor.  Everybody, like...  They go crazy over the guy.  They say, like, he's a good actor and stuff.  I don't know.  I think the girls go to see him, because he's Tom Cruise.  But as far as, like, action thing, like Mission Impossible?  Mm.  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  I didn't see Mission Impossible.  You didn't?  No, I had no desire.  It was okay.  I mean, I'm not gonna say it sucked. 
[02:20:00]  Was it so good that they needed to make a follow-up?  Eh, you know, might be cool to see.  Yeah.  I think.  Okay.  All right.  Ugh.  I'm trying to fix my mic.  Don't mind me.  No one liked the Metallica song.  Rob, what's up?  Uh, that song really sucks.  Really bad.  That's too bad.  Usually movie soundtracks blow, anyway.  If you guys hadn't told me it was a new song, I wouldn't even ever know, because it sounds  like all their other recycled junk.  Wow.  Well, it might be an outtake from one of their last albums or something, you know? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  That song makes worse than my nuts do.  It makes a good point, too.  A lot of these soundtracks, a lot of the rock soundtracks, they're never good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, can I come down and hang out and drink some beers or something like that?  Uh, no.  Today would not be a good day.  Why?  What's the big deal?  What's going on now?  Put it this way.  You'll probably walk in the door, trip on the doorway, fall down, split your mouth open,  and sue us both.  I turned on late.  What's the big deal?  What's going on?  Why are you guys in such trouble?  We're not in trouble.  No. 
[02:21:00]  You said it before.  You said you're in trouble.  Uh, I owe a lot of money that I didn't think I owed, and Ann had a court appearance today.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Hey, listen.  No means no, all right?  So stay out of court.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, shut up.  Wow.  That hurt my ears.  No one liked the Metallica song, Anthony.  All right.  The song is gay Metallica.  The Metallica song blows.  We tried.  The Metallica song is crap.  All right.  We tried. 
[02:21:30]  Hmm.  Anthony, guess whose birthday it is today?  Um.  Who?  Our favorite person.  Favorite person.  Let me think.  Bob Hope.  Bob Hope?  No.  Um.  Rosie?  No.  No?  No.  Whose birthday?  How old is this person?  I really don't even know.  I'm assuming 31 maybe.  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  Maybe the big three of.  Yeah.  Need a hint?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ooh. dah, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!  Virgin.  Okey.  No.  Okay.  No.  She's not a virgin.  She's married to someone as old as you, as a matter of fact. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  I know.  Yeah, she gets to hear that lip smacking.  Yeah.  From both places.  Yeah.  That was Celine Dion's birthday today, Anthony.  Really?  Yes.  And she's, I don't know, 30, 31-ish.  They didn't even print their age?  No.  Does anyone know how old Celine Dion is?  Look at freaking Graywolf.  I thought we got rid of him.  What's she getting for her birth? 
[02:23:00]  Graywolf, get in here.  No, don't get him in here.  Huh?  I went,  What?  Where?  What's she getting?  He was going to Celine Dion, and I was trying to do it with the clue.  Oh, can you do it?  Yeah, let's hear your Titanic.  Play along.  I sound like Ziggy. 
[02:23:30]  I can't do this.  All right, that was good.  I'm out of here.  Okay.  That would be a good idea.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, pathetic.  Thank you.  No, really.  Okay, have a good day.  Okay, there you go.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks.  That was worth interrupting our bit for. 
[02:24:00]  That's great.  Graywolf.  No engines died on the Titanic.  Don't worry.  Anyway, Anthony, Celine Dion's 30, 31st birthday today.  Celine is 32.  So I'm going to sing it online.  I am 32 years old, 32, and I am still trying to get pregnant with my husband, who is 85.  He is Scotso.  In my 32-year-old womb, my eggs sit, sit stranded in my womb, much like the Titanic, sitting there 
[02:24:30]  waiting for my husband's dead sperm to slam into the egg like the iceberg into the mighty  Titanic.  Celine, blow out the candles with her, uh, with her gaping camel toe. 
[02:25:00]  Anyway, yeah, Anthony, there's a, there's an interesting quote from Celine Dion in the  post today as well.  Check this out.  Okay.  Please try to control your laughter.  Celine Dion says, and I, and I quote, yeah, I have my mom's lips and she has no lips, but 
[02:25:30]  I'm a great kisser anyway.  See, wait a minute.  That's a quote from her?  Yeah.  I have my mom's lips and she has no lips.  Celine, believe me, you have lips.  We see him through that jumpsuit.  You may not have lips on top, but you look like a, like you have black man lips in your  pants.  You might not have them on top, but you sure have them down below. 
[02:26:00]  I must take off my panties.  She has a mother's lips, her sisters, everybody else.  They're all down there.  In my huge camel toe.  Happy birthday to me.  My huge camel toe. 
[02:26:30]  I don't have lips on my face because I have more than ample lips down on my cane.  One month small, my lips are so sore.  Happy birthday.  They made me a big cake in the shape of a camel toe and I slice into it. 
[02:27:00]  I'm cranking now.  I'm getting pretty good that song.  So, there you have it. 
[02:27:30]  Is that the best quote, though?  Happy birthday.  Once again, Celine Dion.  I have my mom's lips and she has no lips.  They are huge.  They are like Amadou Diallo in my pants.  You ever see Amadou Diallo's lips?  No, Abner Louima.  I'm sorry.  I always get them confused. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Hey, an old friend is on line six, Anthony.  Who?  Stockbroker Dave.  Oh, maybe he could give us some insight.  Jesus Christ.  Tom from Connecticut.  I'm getting some feedback.  Celine looks like Mick Jagger down below.  Mick Jagger's sleeping.  Stockbroker Dave.  Yo, yo, yo.  God damn.  It's been a long time. 
[02:28:30]  What's up, boy?  What?  They just mop up the floor.  I'm dumping out of any more remarks like that, Dave.  I'm in intense litigation and you're going to get me killed.  Why?  I have the perfect plan.  Don't.  No, no, no.  Dave, please.  It's too serious.  Don't even joke.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  How about you, O?  What's the matter with you?  I owe a certain agency $19,000 and I don't have it.  Oh, man.  Can I have a loan, Dave?  Of course. 
[02:29:00]  I knew you'd say yes.  Of course.  You know that, my brother.  Dave, I know you're on the floor with the New York Stock Exchange and stuff, but what's  up with NASDAQ?  NASDAQ, if it gets here tomorrow, buy it with your eyes closed.  You got another 3%, 4%.  That's it.  What?  You got another 3% correction.  Correction, yeah.  Well, that's right.  You know something.  What do you think?  It was going to go up forever?  No, but every time it went down in the past four effing days, I'm buying.  Yeah.  It's got to go up tomorrow.  I'll buy more today.  It's got to go up tomorrow.  I'll buy more today.  I've got to go. 
[02:29:30]  It should hit 4,200, and that's the bottom.  God, that thing hits five grand, and then tanks.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Things that go up, come down.  Yeah.  How about on our floor?  You doing anything there?  Real stocks?  Oh, the real stocks?  The real stocks?  Okay.  No.  I don't think I have one thing in the New York Stock Exchange.  You and my Mexican landscape.  That's what I do.  Hey, Mr. B, NASDAQ.  I love NASDAQ.  What am I going to do?  Watch one of those stocks from 50 years ago move a 16th every day? 
[02:30:00]  My investments were maturing by the day.  Look at me.  I'm in my brood's hipster.  Look, I was up a 16th this week.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, that's too boring for him.  I want to punch that thing up and go, oh, no, it's down 50 points today.  And then, oh, good, it's up 75 to that.  And like seeing spikes like icicles.  Yeah.  I want that thing looking like alien's teeth.  I want the chart looking like the alien's teeth. 
[02:30:30]  So when are you going to come down to the floor and visit us?  I don't have time.  I'm trading while you're on the floor.  I'd go crazy.  I'd be looking at the board going, ah!  Yeah.  You got a computer, Dave?  Yeah.  Can you hook them up at a booth or something?  Of course.  Of course.  I need something where I can trade wireless over like a Palm Pilot or something.  Yeah, a Palm Pilot.  Can you do that?  Of course.  Yeah, see, I need that.  Everybody does it.  I got to trade while I'm driving. 
[02:31:00]  You could be trading right now, eh?  Yeah, I know, after hours.  Believe me, I'm hooked up.  Dave, the funny thing is he does.  I'm hooked up.  I don't like after hours, though.  No, but he's trading during the show every day now.  Good opportunities after hours.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we got to see what happens tomorrow.  It's Friday.  I'm looking for a good NASDAQ rally tomorrow.  I hope so, eh?  Come on.  What, are we going to have, a straight week?  I think so.  Of crap?  You should get hit, but get ready to buy tomorrow.  So what else is doing, boys?  We're hanging in there. 
[02:31:30]  We're miserable today.  Why?  No, both of you sound like...  Well, we both got, I don't know, bad news today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What can we do to make you happy?  I was in the court of law today.  Yeah.  Watching lawyers talk to each other about my life.  It's real fun.  You know what's the matter with the Cadillac going over a cliff with four lawyers in it?  The Cadillac?  Five.  Bag.  I think you said F in scumbag.  I thought it too, but I realized I was on the air.  Oh, yeah.  What, did you leave the K out? 
[02:32:00]  Same word, pal.  I'm sick of lawyers.  I left the C out.  I am sick of lawyers.  Yeah, well, I got a nice, at least a...  Gee, I don't even know how long I got them in my life now.  You got them till the day you die, by the way.  At least the wife's as good to look at.  Jesus Christ.  She came walking in that courtroom.  I'm like, oh, what the hell is this chick?  That's strategy.  I don't know. 
[02:32:30]  You think?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just thinking it might backfire.  It was an old judge, right?  No, but it's a woman judge.  So I think you look at a woman judge would look at an attractive girl and be all pissed off at her.  Yeah.  Either that or she wants to shove it so far up your ass it comes out your tongue.  Yeah, believe me.  I'm feeling a little throat pain today.  You should have saw how I walked in here today.  Oh, my God.  I had a whisper to everyone.  Guys, Anthony had a really bad day.  I needed the roid pillow that you sit on your chair with because I was reamed out so hard today. 
[02:33:00]  I turned on some Yanni in the office just to keep the soothing music in the background.  We didn't want any problems with the head.  He was ready to snap.  Oh, my word.  Hope, you're such a good bud.  Yeah.  I don't know what Dominic's doing over there.  Hey, you ever been to a courtroom?  You're attractive.  You're hired.  It was funny because I'm, like, you know, helping out Ant today trying to, you know, be there for him. 
[02:33:30]  And then during the show I get a call from home that there was a big envelope there with a huge bill.  Taxis.  Oh, he doesn't want to be too specific, yeah.  Nineteen grand.  Wow.  Huh.  I'm here, my friend, if you need it.  Yeah.  You know that.  How are all the boys, man?  How's Bo and everyone?  Everybody's asking about you.  Wanted to come see you.  When are we going to get some of those fine steaks again?  When are we going to go to the devil playoff game? 
[02:34:00]  Luger's.  We want to go to Luger's.  Okay, cool.  You think we may get Mo to pay for it again?  Nah, we owe him one.  That wouldn't be cool.  Not today.  Opie, please, can you please not be talking like we're going to pay for anything?  Not happening today.  I can't pay.  I'll take you through the drive-thru at McDonald's, Dave, as long as you get a Happy Meal.  If we get really good steak sauce, you won't know the difference.  How's Rick doing? 
[02:34:30]  He's on vacation.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's on vacation every month, it seems like.  Well, he F'd us, too, which is another problem we're having, but Opie's a little angry with Rick at the time being.  It's just been a cluster F of a couple of days.  Oh, man, I feel so bad.  I feel like, what's the matter?  Are you sweating?  I am sweating.  All this time you're sweating.  I had a tough day.  I need a stitch in my thumb.  I'm almost convinced of that.  We were smashing stuff, and I ripped open my thumb.  The one on the palm's not bad anymore, but... 
[02:35:00]  Oh, man.  You missed some fun activity before 4 o'clock, Dave.  I know, I heard.  That's where all the action was.  I heard.  Did you have lesbians in a bathtub or something?  Yeah.  Oh, we did that a while ago, yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to do that again, maybe as soon as next week.  Could I come?  Of course you can.  You are more than...  Well, you know you have an open invite to this show.  I got to come.  Everyone wants to come see your show, also.  All the boys on the floor with the big bucks.  Hey, the old boss is gone.  Now you're allowed to come back.  Dick.  Yeah.  He's still a dick. 
[02:35:30]  Just don't say his name.  No, because he's another guy that wants a piece of our action.  That's all we need.  Who's going to be the lucky millionth person to be in litigation with either of us?  Dave, let me tell you something.  There are so many...  Oh, never mind.  You forgot about that one.  We got a few problems.  Let's just put it that way.  It's insane.  I don't understand this anymore.  That's why I said I'm going back to Apollo Air Condition.  We have a turn.  I swear to God, I'm going to swing a hammer.  Counting Anthony's problem, we got...  Three?  That's a good one.  At least three pending. 
[02:36:00]  More on the way.  We were much happier when we were making nothing, right, guys?  Someone's sending me magazine subscriptions.  Lots of bongas, lots of beers, nobody bothered us.  They're mad.  It barely had to work.  Nobody cared.  Dave, I said it earlier.  My best job ever was when I was a caddy.  No worries in the world.  Right.  Lots of tax-free money.  Right.  Lots of booze at night.  It was great.  Damn.  So...  All right, boys.  All right, Dave.  Good to hear from you again.  Say hi to the family.  Always a pleasure. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, can I say hi to my kids?  They're probably listening.  Really?  You let them listen to this?  Of course.  What are you, crazy?  Jamie and Jake, I love them with all my heart.  All right.  We're going to come down to the floor when we could ring the opening bell.  I hope so.  I'm going to have Opie and Anthony wow hats and throw them out all happy.  You know what the funniest thing is?  When they ring the opening bell...  Yeah.  ...and the futures are, like, down, and you know the market's going to open, like, in a real crappy situation...  ...get your crash helmets on...  ...and they're all, like, smiling and having fun, ringing the bell. 
[02:37:00]  Like, everything's going to tank.  What are you so happy for?  What are you going to look at?  Fair value is way down.  Give me a break here.  What are you so happy about, throwing your little hats to the crowd?  Bastards.  We want to ring the bell.  Come on down.  Make it work.  Come on down.  We'll take care of you.  Cool, Dave.  All right, boys.  Be well.  All right, Dave.  Later, man.  Keep in touch.  Cool.  Bye-bye.  Our old buddy stockbroker, Dave.  Yeah.  Huh? 
[02:37:30]  The poor and destitute show.  Easy.  We'll make a comeback, just like the market.  We'll make a comeback.  Is that it?  Maybe we're coinciding with the NASDAQ, Opie.  We'll make a comeback.  We're tanking.  This isn't the big crash.  No, it's a correction.  This is an Opie and Anthony correction.  It's an Opie and Anthony correction.  It's not the big crash, no.  We need the people on CNBC to talk about it.  It's just a correction Opie and Anthony are having.  If you notice, they've been on a pretty good upswing lately. 
[02:38:00]  And, well, it's got to come down eventually.  A lot of people saying they're overvalued.  Yeah.  A lot of people have said that.  There's been a sell-off.  A lot of people have said that one.  People are going into the more traditional stocks.  Yeah.  Blue chips are taking off.  Opie and Anthony are correcting.  I think they'll rebound.  Or at least have one of those dead cat bounces.  All the other shows in this market, like the blue chips.  Yeah.  Real conservative. 
[02:38:30]  They don't move up and down too much.  What are we like, Anthony?  We're spiky.  We're like eBay.  We're like eBay.  We're eBay.  CD now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  CD now.  Oh, no.  They're in some really poor shape.  Oh, boy.  You look at the chart on CD now.  That would be a fun water slide.  That's about it.  Everybody in the team.  That would be exciting.  Yeah.  It's like the last dip on that Lost World ride. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Okay, we're all right.  Yes, we are.  I think we'll be back.  You guys, sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I'm on the end.  All right, hold on, hold on.  And talk.  Hey, what's up?  So, what did he say?  It's the Amos and Andy show. 
[02:39:30]  Broken Destitute.  Hope's on the phone.  He's talking with Sandy about his situation.  All right, wait.  Screw Anthony.  What did he say about me?  Wait, wait, no, no.  I want to hear about me, too.  What does Don't Worry About Me mean?  Ah, don't worry about it.  He was with another client.  This is a little more important than the other client, don't you think?  Yes, absolutely.  I agree with you.  Screw Anthony.  It's not about Anthony this time.  What about me?  About me.  What about me? 
[02:40:00]  Hey, oh.  He's in how much trouble, Ant?  Oh, shut up.  It's the buttocks.  I'm listening to you.  Go ahead.  Dude, please.  He's trying to goof on me like I'm in more trouble.  I'm like the guy who has life that kills the guard.  It's like, who cares at this point?  Give me a break.  Sam, what does he mean by don't worry?  Don't worry.  Is it don't worry or don't worry?  Or is it don't worry?  I hate when people say don't worry when they, it's, it's your life. 
[02:40:30]  No, I hate when people say don't worry before they even look at the problem.  Oh, oh.  That's not good.  Mm-hmm.  Call him up.  Mm-hmm.  Call him right now.  Mm-hmm.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking worry.  This has been a cloud, a black cloud hanging over the show.  He's not panicking because, you know, it's not his money.  It's not him.  He's not panicking.  He doesn't have the right to check. 
[02:41:00]  Right?  Mm.  He'll handle it.  Did he look at it at all?  No.  He didn't look at it and he said don't worry?  Yeah.  I hate when people do that.  Oh, my God.  Can you talk to Anthony?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You want to talk to Ann?  Why?  I'll give her the phone.  Jesus Christ.  She's got a message for you now.  Oh, my God.  I'll be on the radio and you can talk on the phone.  All right.  So, it's the OP and Anthony show.  Hi.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:41:30]  What a mess of a day this has been.  Yeah?  Ann is now talking to...  Oh, really?  ...san.  I'll get...  At some point, I'll probably get the same letter.  And...  Make that a quadruple.  But it'll go to my old address. 
[02:42:00]  Well, that'll end up in the shredder.  Along with your clothes.  Yeah.  Right.  It'll end up in the same place your clothes ended up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There'll be a letter, a very important letter in the Goodwill bin.  That's good.  That's great.  With your $1,500 mountain bike.  What did he say?  Don't worry about it?  I hate when people say, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  You should have saw how big this package was, according to Sandy.  Great, great.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  That's good.  That's good.  Huh?  Hey, does the ex-spouse have to pick up the debt also?  Like, do they split half the debt?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Hey, wait a minute.  That was a joint account.  Oops.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, that was a joint return.  Oh, guess who's liable for half of that?  Jeez.  How about that?  Hey, great.  Might have scored a good one.  I hope it's twice as much.  How does this turn out to be good news for Anthony? 
[02:43:00]  It's horrible news for me.  It's good news for Anthony if he's going to get the same thing I got today.  Half.  I'm only liable for half of that, my friend.  All right.  Let me see.  You know something, though?  Some way, it ain't going to work out that way.  I know it.  I'm not delusional.  All right, Sandy.  Here's Opie back on the phone.  Please hold.  Thank you.  No.  I don't think anyone's listening to our radio show anymore today, anyway.  No.  Everybody probably dumped out very early.  In the day, when we were very angry and breaking things.  You have to tell me one more thing? 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  What?  I don't know.  Our show is way too funny.  Oh, gee, thanks.  Good.  What do you find funny about this show today?  Everything.  Is it the wacky bit that we're doing that we're financially destitute?  Yeah.  That's good.  Laf Raya, scream a minute.  She thinks we're real funny today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  How was the job search today?  Oh, my God.  Oh, nothing, sweet. 
[02:44:00]  Nothing.  I'm just happy that you're enjoying our pain today.  Okay.  Okay.  Terrific.  It's very funny.  Okay.  Oh, you like the Celine Dion.  Okay.  Your mom was laughing.  That's okay.  Let's make the 50-year-old ladies laugh today.  That's good.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, my brother's there?  Okay.  Tell him I said hi.  Okay.  Tell him I need some money. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  What?  Stop laughing.  She's laughing.  That's great.  All right.  I'll try to do that.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Don't spend any money.  All right.  Bye.  Hope, I think...  We're a laugh riot today.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm in the same boat, huh?  That's what...  Yeah, she was saying.  Without giving out too many details.  Yeah.  So your day just got worse. 
[02:45:00]  A little more expensive.  How could your day get worse?  But it just didn't.  Can you believe it?  This is probably...  This is like...  It's Black Thursday for us.  I'm ready to jump out the window.  What?  Oh, my God.  This is like when the stock market crashed in the 30s.  Or the 29 or whatever the hell that was.  I'll go as far back as October 88.  Yeah.  This is awful.  I'm probably going to get the same letter.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, that's what you just said.  Very good.  That's nice.  But the problem is you're never going to see the letter.  I have a change of address then.  Right.  I have a change of address then.  Yeah.  Well, it would screw her too, so she's got to realize that.  Oh, now we've got people that don't even know who...  All right.  Get him out of here.  He's a psycho.  All right.  Who upstairs...  You know something?  Holy cow.  This is amazing that people are walking into this goddamn studio. 
[02:46:00]  Anthony, go grab him.  I'll grab him.  Who?  Be nice to him, though.  What would he do?  Just politely throw him out the door.  How the hell did he get down here?  How did he get in here?  He said he snuck a little back way.  He snuck a little back way.  Our doors are supposedly opened.  They're just wide open.  What doors?  The door's upstairs.  This isn't a radio station.  Just say, everybody, come on in.  All the doors are open.  You got in through the...  All right.  You know...  What do you mean all the doors are open?  Up front?  You mean you can walk right into... 
[02:46:30]  You can walk right in.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, come on in, everybody.  Just walk up into WINS and steal whatever you want.  Go ahead.  Come in here and punch us in the face.  You'll do us a favor today.  It's no one's fault except security, I guess.  You walked right in.  There is no security at this place.  I was sitting right here in the studio.  Mark comes out and says, what are you doing?  The guy goes, oh, I walked right in.  I want to check out the show.  That guy...  That guy looked like he was freaking possessed.  You ever go to K-Rock?  It's like going on to an LL flight.  Why are you guys laughing?  This is serious crap. 
[02:47:00]  You can't get in that place.  There's metal detectors.  I have said this is...  Compared to K-Rock,  we have terrible security for a long time.  K-Rock is like Sing Sing.  K-Rock is like Fort Knox.  We're like nothing.  We're like crap.  They're hoping someone bumps us off.  At this point, so we're...  We're like...  That guy's a total wacko.  He's like, I just want me to open and empty.  I walk like this.  Great, great.  I saw him.  I was wondering who the hell he was.  I thought it was one of PR's friends.  That guy looked like a serious man.  Dude, that guy is a psycho.  That's what?  Like a...  My heart stopped. 
[02:47:30]  Dude, what a psychopath mother ever.  Can we talk to somebody about this?  I mean, seriously.  You've got to stop.  Seriously.  It's been a joke and stuff,  and like we're goofing about it and stuff in the past.  What the...  He goes...  You want to hear what he says?  He goes,  I just passed...  I just did the fire department test,  and I just wanted to come by and congratulate Opie.  I hope you have them congratulate me for doing it.  Right, and he just walks in.  Walk through the tech floor.  Can we get some type of friggin' system here  that they keep their doors locked at least? 
[02:48:00]  Dude, this is...  That's bad news, man.  Unbelievable.  You guys have been to K-Rock  and seen their setup over there, right?  Oh, my God.  You can't even walk in that place.  We were there when we were interviewing.  Sure.  Fort Knox.  You can't even get in the front door.  You can't get front door.  You walk out of the elevator.  That's it.  You're done.  You're done.  Mark's face.  Mark's like,  what the hell are you doing?  In here, they walk right into the studio.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  How many locked doors are between here and the studio? 
[02:48:30]  Three.  Three.  Supposed to be three.  They're all open.  Both.  Wonderful.  Great.  That means he got through this door over here.  He got through Coden.  How did he get through that?  Yeah, how did he get through that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, you know,  I haven't figured out.  But the other door to go towards our offices has been broken.  So maybe he went through there and then cut through John's area.  No.  Someone opened the door.  Who the hell is opening the door?  People just opened the doors for people.  And no one questioned them.  That's all.  You know something?  Look at you.  This is out of freaking control. 
[02:49:00]  Because I said to Spaz,  I go, who the hell is that guy out there?  And it's on PR.  I thought it was one of your friends.  Out of control.  Yeah.  Out of control.  PR, did you let him in by accident?  No.  All right.  I think he came and got me.  Dude, it happens all the time.  People upstairs don't know who's who down on this floor.  It happens all the time.  How many times have we talked about this?  Well, now I'm really pissed about this.  We still have out of the F's upstairs.  I want him fired.  We still have a bunch of people that are incompetent that work for this radio station.  That's all I'm going to say.  Incompetent.  There's not many left, but there are a couple of holdouts. 
[02:49:30]  They still think it's 1972 and there's a bunch of old, boring jocks on the radio.  Virgin coming.  Where's Virgin coming?  God.  Ridiculous.  Unbelievable.  Ridiculous.  Harold's out there with the nightstick.  We'll probably let him in.  This is the goof station of Infinity Broadcasting.  Welcome to NEW, the goof station.  It's for a goof.  We'll throw some people on the air and goof.  I was upstairs.  Oh, who's this?  Who's this? 
[02:50:00]  Uh-oh.  Someone's getting in trouble.  Ben's going with some guy in a suit.  What does he say?  Who's the suit?  And what's he yelling at Ben for?  He said, I was upstairs.  I'm going to clarify this right now with you.  He's pissed.  He's pissed?  We just had a serial killer 10 feet from us.  I was saying something about he was the guy.  He's upstairs.  Well, why did he let somebody down here?  He's about to clarify it with Ben.  There's no clarifying it.  That can't happen.  He's pissed.  Who is this guy?  I put my application for security here.  All right.  Well, what does he do? 
[02:50:30]  Hold on.  Someone go get our...  Someone go get our...  What does he control?  All right.  Listen.  No, seriously.  Not locked doors.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Listen.  Listen.  Someone immediately go down and get our new boss to go upstairs for that meeting.  Yeah.  Because he needs to be in on that if he's still here and if he has the...  There's no ifs, ands, buts, or excuses for sending somebody down here that doesn't have  the proper credentials or authority to be down here.  The right size chest.  It doesn't matter.  What he said while he was at the desk, upstairs at reception. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Listen.  We have 35 minutes left in the show, and the odds are pretty good someone is going to get  punched in the face.  So, if I was you, I would not leave.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  It's going to be...  Unbelievable.  I don't know what the hell is going on on the show today, but if I...  You're crazy.  Turn the tile, because the tension is mounting.  God damn.  Bites next.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  I was just downstairs with you guys, outside your studio door, and I guess I shouldn't 
[02:51:30]  have been there so easily, but I was in the city today.  I'm sitting outside your building now in the stoop here.  I took the physical event for the Fire Department of New York, and I was pretty psyched, because  I got 100 on it.  Good God.  So, I wanted to come down and see if I could get a little word out on the other firefighters  in the city who are friends of mine and help me, give me the encouragement to take  the test and stuff, so...  Well, you don't understand.  You know something?  You might be the nicest guy in the world.  Right.  There is no way they should have let you in this studio.  Oh, no.  No one let me in.  The door's open. 
[02:52:00]  I just kind of walked in.  Well, there's no way the door should be open.  What door did you all walk into?  How did you get in here?  I walked in.  There was a door near...  What's...  There was a desk there.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What floor did you get off of?  I got off on the 10th floor.  10th floor up at Wins.  Okay.  There's a big glass door, right?  Yeah, that was...  How did you get through that?  That was open.  I just...  Open.  Was anybody at the desk?  No.  No.  All right.  Door unlocked.  No one at the desk.  So that's the first door that's unlocked.  There's three locked doors between the outside and our radio station. 
[02:52:30]  So you walked down the stairs.  Yeah, I walked down the stairs.  And now there's another...  There's two locked doors.  One to the right, one to the left.  Then what'd you do?  Somebody walked in, and I followed him through the door to the left.  Followed him through the door to the...  Who?  Who?  It wasn't me.  Who?  What did he look like?  What did he look like?  Um, I think he had short hair, and I didn't get a look at his face.  I don't know how it worked, so I just kind of carried something good. 
[02:53:00]  Was it you, Stinky?  Yeah, I saw him.  Are you kidding me?  He might have had a baseball cap.  Stinky.  Wait, wait, baseball cap.  Oh, my God, Stinky.  This is not good for you.  This is very not good for you.  It's not yet.  No, it's Stinky.  No, I...  Stinky's fessing to it, which is good.  It's very honorable, and it's a good thing that you come forward.  I saw something in your guy's office.  I came back, and he was standing in with...  He followed you through one of the doors?  With the lunch table?  Yeah, and then there was a room with, like, couches and stuff, and a couple of guys hanging  out there.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yep. 
[02:53:30]  Is Stinky's mic on?  Oh.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay, and what did you do, Stinky?  You opened the door.  I went through the door.  He turned his back.  I went to close the door, and then I ran up here, and he must have, just before it closed,  because I made...  I tried to make sure...  To your defense, he shouldn't have even been there in the first place to get through the  upstairs door.  But, did you look at him and recognize him or anything?  No, that's why, right when I saw him standing here, I went over to Mark, and I asked him who  he was.  Very good.  Okay, then you did it.  Now, obviously, there was a little slip-up with you letting somebody through the door 
[02:54:00]  like that, but, like I said, to your defense, the guy shouldn't have even been down here.  Someone's got to do something.  Why isn't that door locked?  Why isn't that door upstairs locked?  I don't know.  Because they're retarded.  Yeah, I didn't mean to cause everyone to panic down there.  I mean, everyone kind of got up in alarm to get me out of there as fast as they could,  but I apologize for that.  No, that's what we needed.  And, Kevin, if you're a faithfulist to the show, we apologize for treating you like that.  No, that's okay.  Well, we didn't really know who you were, and you looked a little kooky, to be honest 
[02:54:30]  with you.  Oh, did I?  Just a little.  That's cool, I guess.  Did you carry all those hoses up the six flights of stairs and stuff?  Yeah, well, not today.  That's another task, hopefully.  But, yeah, so I was hoping I could come down and just hang out and watch how you guys do  your show from, like, that couch room where everyone kind of eats and stuff.  If that's cool.  You saw everything.  I have a blueprint of the plan.  Right.  Yeah, right?  I mean, if that's cool.  I mean, right now I'm sitting outside your stoop.  I'm near, I don't even know where I am, but...  I can see through my scope, your elevator door. 
[02:55:00]  Better move.  Better move.  All right, Kevin, we overreacted.  We apologize.  It had nothing to do with you, but there's a problem in our system here.  Hey, well...  Definitely a slip-up.  A breach in security.  Yes.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  I don't know.  What are we going to do with Kevin now?  Now I feel bad.  Snake and nape my paws.  Well, we do have a cop here.  Can you frisk him?  No, I got nothing but a wire on keys.  That's all on the phone.  All right, we got a cop here.  Kevin, come back up to the 10th floor. 
[02:55:30]  Do not walk in any doors.  Okay.  We'll come get you.  We're going to frisk you, and sure, you can come down and hang.  All right, cool, man.  Thank you.  But please don't do that again.  Okay.  We don't really...  We don't encourage anyone just to walk in on our show.  That gave us a heart attack.  Unbelievable.  Unless, of course, they have huge cans.  All right?  All right.  I'll be up in the middle.  Yeah, really.  Like if it was a chicken, you'd be like, hey, good thing she made it in.  I know.  Hey, this is great.  Come on in.  We got huge cans.  We won't even frisk him.  We'll frisk him.  No, no. 
[02:56:00]  Go on, girl.  Well, frisk him.  Don't bring weapons, but torpedoes are fine.  All right, Ed.  Unbelievable.  And now where's Ben?  He's getting yelled at.  You know something?  If he's getting yelled at, I'm pissed.  Because Ben should not be getting yelled at at all.  Someone go check on Ben.  Let's see what's going on with there.  Upstairs at Windsor.  I'll tell you something.  We're a brother and sister station, but those mother, they, at the drop of a hat, at the  drop of a hat, they will bitch us out for having some of our guests in their waiting  room. 
[02:56:30]  You know, oh, my goodness, there's a girl here with tattoos.  And she's been in the waiting room for an hour.  We're a legitimate news organization.  Yet they let every frigging kook in that doesn't have any reason being here.  I'm sick of it.  Like their listeners are just, you know, knocking down the door to go, you know, check out the  1010 Winds guys.  We're trying to get traffic on the ones, and there's a girl out there with tattoos.  Give me a break.  Oh.  Anthony, just when you thought today couldn't get any worse, I swear to you, this is just 
[02:57:00]  amazing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is just amazing.  Okay, go ahead, because I'm just waiting here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  From the law offices, blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah.  We just got a fax.  Oh, it's Isa.  Let me see.  I swear to you. 
[02:57:30]  Let me see.  No, I'll just show you the letterhead.  Turn it around.  Letterhead.  Okay.  All right.  Show that to me better.  It's legit, too.  Okay.  You'll know in a sec.  Okay.  Okay.  There's the letterhead.  Wow.  Seems like a pussy radio station that will remain nameless.  Yeah.  Tattled on us about playing the Metallica song from the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack  that our listeners thought sucked.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, God.  Remember I said, like, no one in the country is allowed to play it?  Right.  So I'm sure those guys over at the other station quickly got on their phones to tattle on us.  Yes.  They just suck.  Dear Sir or Madam, the firm represents Hollywood Records, the copyright owner of the forthcoming  Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack album.  The album contains a master recording by Metallica of the musical composition I Disappear  and a master recording by Limp Bizkit entitled Mission Impossible 2 Theme. 
[02:58:30]  Neither of the masters have been released for broadcast.  Okay.  It has come to Hollywood's attention that you have been broadcasting either or both of the  masters without our client's authorization.  Hey!  It has come to our attention.  That means someone tattled on your pals, O.P. and Anthony.  Whoa!  Because Hollywood has not granted permission for such performance by you and the masters  have not been released, such performance violates the relevant provisions of Title 17 of the 
[02:59:00]  United States Code and may subject you to other actionable rules.  Oh, legal talk!  Under relevant federal and state law.  Oh, my God.  I just felt money fly out of my pocket when you were saying that.  It's amazing.  You don't have no money.  Hollywood hereby demands that you immediately cease and desist from any further broadcasts  of the masters.  Our client intends to hold you fully liable to the full extent of the law for any unauthorized  broadcasts of the masters.  But we're just a goofy radio show. 
[02:59:30]  How is this happening?  At this point, we have no money left.  Trust me.  Don't even bother.  What happened to the fun?  Does anyone remember laughter?  What happened to the fun, Opie?  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Very truly yours, douche.  Douche, douche, douche, douche, douche.  We have been ordered to stop playing the Metallica song.  Oh, well.  It wasn't that good anyway.  Let's see if all the listeners didn't like it, so. 
[03:00:00]  Oops.  Hey, right on the team.  Hey, what was in the CD player?  Okay, terrific.  Oops.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize that was in the CD player.  Jeez, man.  Well, we should be allowed to play it shortly, right?  Yeah.  When it comes out?  Oh, yeah.  So I guess we should probably put it in a safe place where it will be readily available  when we are legally allowed to play this CD. 
[03:00:30]  Because, you know, you've got to abide by the rules.  If they say we shouldn't play the CD, we shouldn't.  Right.  But when that date comes out and every station around the country can play it,  we ought to have it readily available in a safe place so we can pull it out and play it.  Opie, if you could please file away.  I know sometimes a file cabinet throws off some flack when you open it.  That's why you're wearing your safety console. 
[03:01:00]  Of course.  What?  We have the...  You look like I'm scuba diving.  New Metallica that we've been banned from playing until it's legally.  Yes.  Legally.  So with that, Anthony, let me just...  Okay, file that away with your safety goggles on.  Over here, right?  Yeah, right in the usual place.  Right next to all the most offensive songs?  That we cherish for the most offensive song content? 
[03:01:30]  Right next to the CD from the guy that sings Like Elvis, the other dead artist.  Like Elvis.  Remember him?  Sure, Anthony.  Right next to We Deliver Keggers.  Okay.  You got it?  He's ready.  Put the mic by the file cabinet.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The Enola Gay.  There it is, rolling off the runway.  The Enola Gay.  Carl Gibbett and his men.  Ascending to the sky with the implement of destruction in her belly. 
[03:02:00]  I need another Band-Aid.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Oops.  A glorious B-29.  Oh, my God.  What a mess.  You know how much crap we have broken today?  A lot of stuff today.  Well, we have a lot of tension to get out of our systems. 
[03:02:30]  I think it's healthy.  Excuse me.  Unbelievable.  We got people just coming in the studio out of nowhere.  We're getting letters from lawyers that we can't play records.  Like that's, you know, at this point, that's a joke.  Don't play that.  Ooh, I'm scared.  Wow.  This is the biggest legal matter I've had to deal with.  I can't play a song.  Trust me.  We weren't going to play it again. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  It wasn't that good.  Blank it.  Being a huge Metallica fan.  Ben's getting yelled at still?  Why?  Why?  Is our boss here?  Where's our boss?  Back him up.  The assistant PD's here.  All right.  Well, what's the guy upstairs bitching about?  And why are they yelling at Ben?  Somebody effed up upstairs.  It's the door upstairs.  The guy's giving a demonstration to Ben of how somebody can get in.  Ben, through one door on the 10th floor, there's a demonstration. 
[03:03:30]  You know how we could demonstrate?  That the door wasn't locked and someone got in.  We should put it on the website so everyone can come through.  Yeah, sure.  Come on down.  Come to line.  Yeah, thanks.  Demonstrating.  He had you perfectly.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Okay.  And let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  If we didn't give you guys material today, then F you.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:04:00]  A bunch of ladies going.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where  I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  1027.  WNAW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're smashing pumpkins, man.  Yeah.  I was jamming the new CD on the subway today. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  Someone has my Black Crow's Jimmy Page CD.  Jay Moore.  Why are we sending Jay Moore free CDs?  Why are we sending him my free CDs?  Smashing pumpkins playing April 25th.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  Kiss coming back to town, Anthony, with Ted Nugent.  Jones Beach.  Very cool.  Okay. 
[03:05:00]  No kiss.  Yes.  Is this their third farewell tour?  Pretty much.  They didn't milk enough money out of us yet?  What do they got?  That commercial with that little girl from the Pepsi thing?  You see that one?  She's all in Kiss makeup.  Did I see that?  That's an example of someone's 15 minutes being way up.  The little girl.  The first commercial was like, okay, kind of cool. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Cute idea.  We're talking about the Pepsi commercials with that annoying girl.  Yeah, little girl with the dimples.  Now the latest one, she's in Kiss makeup with Kiss.  I'm just like, we saw last time they were here, and they were here live in the studio.  We spoke with them.  Man, they know how to milk a buck.  Unbelievable.  That Gene Simmons.  Maybe they could teach us.  We need to start milking some heavy bugs.  Something tells me that's the only reason they got back together, though.  It was because they were probably in similar situations. 
[03:06:00]  As us?  Yeah.  I don't think they really liked each other very much.  Let's start selling Opie and Anthony crap.  Opie and Anthony master cards.  Have we been around?  Maybe we haven't been around long enough to, uh...  Can we break up and then have a reunion thing?  That's not a bad idea.  Let's just do it for like a day.  Let's break up for a week.  For a week, and then we'll have a big, huge reunion show.  Right.  Are we going to do it with makeup or without?  Because I know we show up at the station every day with makeup on.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:06:30]  It's very important.  Yeah, that's us.  That we wear makeup.  What a mess.  All right.  Well, let's play, uh...  Let's play, uh...  What did we learn today?  Yeah.  That's what I was trying to say.  There's a lot today.  Uh, wow.  A real deal.  Man junk from the city checking in, Anthony.  Man junk.  I learned that your security is as tight as a hooker's...  Yeah.  You know the word.  Thank you.  That was very good.  Charles Manson also checking in from prison.  Hey, Chuck.  I learned that when I get out, I'm going to just walk right in and hang out on the Lesbo 
[03:07:00]  Couch.  Come on in.  The Manson and Kaczynski morning show.  Uh, Lizard from Wanton.  Today I learned that Earl is as queer as a tennis helmet and schools in the Bronx have better  security than 1027.  They do.  Oh, that's very good.  Today I learned that not even a bed from Rockaway Bedding can ease the pain of losing half  your stuff.  Wow.  Yeah, you got that right.  That was, uh, Royal from Jersey.  All right, you got that right. 
[03:07:30]  Uh, let's see.  Hank from Jersey.  Today I learned that when it rains, it pours and pours and pours.  Have a drink of me, boys.  And let's go to the phones and see what other people have learned, Anthony.  Uh, Jason, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I learned today that after looking at his hands, uh, Earl's gay.  Terrific.  Virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah, we took the, we all took the gay test today. 
[03:08:00]  Uh, it's in the post.  And are, are we sending that to unofficial Steve there?  Yeah.  Foundrymusic.com.  We're sending the Earl hand with the, uh, the post article.  Yeah, I guess you can tell from your hand if you're gay or not.  And we all took the test and Earl failed miserably.  His index finger is a lot shorter than his ring finger.  It's almost as short as his pinky, matter of fact.  Which means, uh, you're gay, according to the post.  And, uh, and Psycho Mark failed the test as well.  Yeah, I hope he's still interested in, uh, scalping your WrestleMania trip. 
[03:08:30]  Uh, yeah.  I've been told that would be a problem, too, so.  All right.  No more trouble.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Whew.  Whew.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that from now on, today ought to be taking the Keith for Thursday.  No doubt.  You know, you guys need, like, a tube of KY just to make tomorrow's broadcast a little easier, man.  Thank God it's a Friday.  Yeah, tell me about it.  I never, uh, imagined that the show was going to get worse when we started. 
[03:09:00]  You're bringing everybody down.  No, I think.  I just want to curl.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I just want to curl up in a fetal position and go to my happy place.  Yeah.  Like, lend clothes from the Big Chill and cry?  Go to my happy place.  Pretty much.  That's what I'm going to do tonight in the shower.  Well, take it easy, guys.  All naked and stuff.  Fetal position with the warm water flowing down on my naked body.  Did you ever imagine the show would get worse? 
[03:09:30]  Like, we were in the office, Ant and I talking, and we're buds, obviously.  And I'm like, come on in, we'll make something out of the show today.  Yeah.  You had a tough day.  Had a rough one.  And I never thought I'd get the phone call that I owe 19 grand.  And then on top of that, we find out that Ant's getting the same letter.  So on top of the crap he went through earlier, he's got to deal with what I'm dealing with.  Nice.  Because we're like twins when it comes to this crap.  I know. 
[03:10:00]  And then we get, like, a lawyer, you know, faxing us, saying they're going to, like, I don't know,  take legal actions because we played a horrible Metallica song.  I could see that happen.  What are you in for, man?  Oh, we played a Metallica song.  We weren't supposed to.  You can do me in the rear now.  Scott, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that Opie's going to be in the next homeless shopping spree.  Oh, very good.  How old are you, Scott?  You guys still don't remember me?  I called about the sex ed question.  Oh, yeah.  You're, uh, wait, seventh grade? 
[03:10:30]  Six.  Well, that's close enough.  Opie, you should remember his age.  Sorry, I was going to guess 20, Scott.  See, if it was 19, it would be easy.  That's how many thousands of Opie's.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  And, of course, it'd have to be geriatric for me to remember.  Hey, guys, F syndication, lesbian fantasies now.  All right.  Thank you.  See you.  Wow.  Hal from New York might have hit it on the head today.  What?  This just came in on Instant Feedback, Anthony.  Check it out.  I learned not to play baby raper with an infant in the studio because God will punish you 
[03:11:00]  on the air the next day.  See?  Oh, man.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Words to live by.  That's a little weird if you think about it because yesterday it was really ugly at the  end of the show.  Yeah.  What did I do?  I was calling you an insensitive.  Yeah.  You were an accomplice because only God knows that you had time to come over here and shut 
[03:11:30]  that song off.  All right.  You can say what you want, but you know it's true.  I kind of thought it was funny, too.  All right.  Gary, what's going on?  Hollywood records suck.  Oh.  Hey, don't say that.  They'll sue you.  They'll sue you.  All right.  Thanks, Gary.  Hello.  You were playing our Metallica song, and I'm very angry.  I'm suing everybody.  You're not supposed to play it until the movie comes out and the album comes out so people 
[03:12:00]  can buy it before they realize it blows monkey ass.  Hey, Len.  Play it again.  I'll take your shoes and your glasses and 19 grand and half your stuff.  Okay.  Thank you.  Len, what did you learn on the show today?  Today I learned that the new Metallica is as gay as Earl's hands.  That's pretty good.  Do you have any Yankee tickets? 
[03:12:30]  No, we don't.  Oh, that sucks.  Anyway, guys, sorry about today.  No.  You know something?  I had fun.  It brought Ant and I closer together.  Not in a homo way, but it just got us back on the same page.  You know, what were we going to do if something happens like that and you sit and what are  you going to sit at home and you sulk?  We kind of, you know, blew it out, got it out there over the air, kind of vented.  Oh, we have problems.  I'm just trying to figure out what both of you could do to owe $19,000 each.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You have been listening to this show for two years, haven't you? 
[03:13:00]  The plane that was supposed to bring the Coke crashed.  It crashed right over the Florida Keys and we never covered the stash.  So now the Colombians are so pissed that we have to pay them $19,000 each or we're going  to get Colombian neckties.  Oh, crap.  I did say it was a big package at home.  Remember, I said that earlier.  Because there was a horse head in the package.  So if I see that pilot, he's dead.  Thank you, Larry.  All right.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're next on WNEW. 
[03:13:30]  How are you, man?  All right.  Thank you.  Lawyers suck hairy open man ass.  Yeah.  All right.  That's number one.  I'll.  Number two.  I like that.  And number two, I'd just like to say, thank God I was the only one that had a bad Thursday.  Yeah.  I was just going around, man, like syphilis.  I can't imagine anyone had a worse day than us.  Dude, we have some teeth eating a bagel this morning.  I go for six grand in bridge work.  Oh, shit.  Six grand.  Did I get a letter from the IRS?  Get a bag of shells.  No.  It would be a bag of shells. 
[03:14:00]  Big screen and dental work.  Wow.  That's the record to be it.  You guys should have been dentists.  At least you have teeth.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  You know, you've got something for your cash.  Teeth.  That's true.  One of the things we're doing on the show tomorrow, I challenge you guys, I guarantee  there's not one person that listens to this show that had a worse day than us.  Yeah.  Today.  That's pretty good.  If you've got a story, save it for tomorrow, okay?  Tomorrow we'll do that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, you're next on WNAW. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Hey, I learned today that your security is about as tight as Celine Dion's lips.  Hey, you guys...  Jay, you rock.  Hey, you guys might want to think about putting some money into that Vince McMahon football  deal.  Yes.  Vince.  That's a guarantee, right?  You know, hey...  Who picked that up?  NBC?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that, huh?  Hey, if you're in with them, who knows?  How'd their stock do today? 
[03:15:00]  They must have went up with that, right?  Did it?  Thank you, Jay.  You got it, guys.  You rock.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on NW.  How are you?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, I learned that K-R's got a small index finger.  I know you're stuck, too.  You guys rock.  Thank you, Chris.  Be good.  All right.  Haywood from Yonkers.  I learned Gray Wolf was the most...  I know.  I learned Gray Wolf was the most financially secure guy in the studio today.  Yeah.  At least he knows where his assets are.  His flute and his little mojo pouch he wears. 
[03:15:30]  You guys come up with the best stuff, I'm telling you, man.  You keep us going with your witty humor.  Wife and want half of flute.  Gonna sound very high.  Must saw in half.  Make piccolo.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  What's that?  I learned today that Anthony got the most expensive boob shot today.  Yeah.  That's right.  I could have flown to Vegas, gotten hummus from 20 hookers, and flown around the world  the other way to come home. 
[03:16:00]  And it was still been cheaper than the quick boob shot I saw off my wife's lawyer today.  Hey, boy.  You got stuck.  She was leaning over to tell my lawyer how she was going to suck me dry out of my cash.  And she leans over, and I caught a quick up the shirt shot.  This is the highlight of my day, besides the guy having a heart attack two seats down.  I forgot about the heart attack, guys.  I had a heart attack right on the bench. 
[03:16:30]  I was sitting on one of the benches.  He has a heart attack.  You know what's so funny, though?  As I'm watching any money that I have anywhere disappear, and the woman that's like my wife's  lawyer, responsible for taking care of this, even though everything is going down the crapper,  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, boob shot.  Oh, this sucks.  Oh, I can't say.  Hey, boob shot. 
[03:17:00]  She's pretty hot.  I got to give her that much.  All right, well.  I wasn't expecting that to walk in.  I only hire the hot lawyers.  Revenge.  Revenge for my 1995 appearance on the Stern Show.  Coming back at me ten effing falls, man.  Hey, Bob.  You thought it was funny making fun of me.  You thought it was funny on the E! Show.  I couldn't fit in the elevator, huh?  Here it comes. 
[03:17:30]  Wham!  Wham!  That's some great obscure stuff.  Oh, my God.  That's classic.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob.  Yo, Anthony.  I learned today that it's cheaper to keep her.  That's the principle of it.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right, man.  How's it going?  We've got to get out of here.  Yeah, how do you do that?  You know, so then after you've gone through certain aspects of a divorce thing, the beginning phases where it's really starting to get ugly, and then you're like, okay, I'll keep her. 
[03:18:00]  And then you're like, hi, I'm living with the extortionist.  Yeah, well, that's the reason I'm with her, because it's cheaper to keep her.  That's why.  Give me a break.  Like I said, I'll swing an effing hammer and knock tin for $250 a week.  Chris from Staten Island, Dan.  I learned that divorce is worse than taking a Tel Aviv cab. 
[03:18:30]  It's even longer.  All right, we've got to go.  It lasts longer than waiting for them.  We've got to go.  Dynamite is next.  Tomorrow's after you, Friday.  Oh, what a warm-up day we had today.  All right, we'll see what happens tomorrow.  Thank you for listening to us.  Well, you're all we got.  We love you.  We love you.  Please don't leave us.  You guys leave us, too.  Don't leave us.  They won't take you away in the settlement. 
[03:19:00]  I promise.  What do you mean you need room?  What do you mean I'm too clingy?  We need you.  Yeah, Anthony, we've taken your listeners.  No, we need the visitation rights.  Please.  Please.  Thanks for the love of God.  Night, people.  Don't leave your pals in their time of need.  All right, we've got to go.  See you tomorrow, too.  Tomorrow. 
[03:19:30]  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
