<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton self-deprecatingly acknowledging their controversial reputation.  They transitioned to listener backlash from a previous, inflammatory Leap Day segment featuring a sex toy and a doctor.  This segued into a discussion of the presidential election, with Norton revealing his Republican leanings despite reservations about the candidates.  A substantial portion was dedicated to mocking a Reverend Al Sharpton MSNBC segment featuring a comedically inept bit with a non-ringing phone.  Technical difficulties with the clip caused on-air panic from staff member Sam, followed by a discussion of the clip's editing for rebroadcast.

The hosts then engaged in raunchy jokes about Rick Santorum's campaign, targeting his daughter's appearance.  The conversation jumped to the New York Islanders' hockey loss, March Madness brackets (including a humorous misunderstanding of the number of teams), and a segment about the violent hockey fight scenes in *Goon*,  which they previewed.  They also reminisced about a past interview with Dick Vitale.  The show also covered studio lighting issues and upcoming plans for a live broadcast in Cleveland, including a planned "Cleveland steamer" bit.  Norton's Weight Watchers membership was mentioned, and he interacted with a female caller who offered to be his Weight Watchers buddy.

A significant portion focused on Weight Watchers, featuring detailed discussions with caller Jimmy about point systems, rollover points, and activity points, along with banter about the program's absurdity. Other callers, including Megan, participated, discussing food choices (including Weight Watchers ice cream) and the diet's challenges.  The conversation veered into unrelated tangents.  A call from Flo-reen dominated the latter part.  Flo-reen's employment application led to a sexually charged and offensive conversation about her appearance, sexual preferences, lifestyle, and family situation, including her late sister's drug overdose.  The hosts agreed to see a picture, which was later shared and discussed.  Other briefly mentioned topics included the challenges of maintaining weight loss, a listener's Weight Watchers meeting experience, a weatherman's on-air blunder, Mike Vitti's apology for an accidental broadcast of gay pornography, and the controversy surrounding the "Round Eye Noodle Bar" in Philadelphia.

The show heavily criticized the renaming of the "Round Eye Noodle Bar," arguing it was a self-deprecating joke, not a slur, and using offensive racial slurs and derogatory language in the process.  The hosts also discussed John Liu's political career and controversies.  Caller Danielle expressed frustration with perceived unfair treatment of Americans and high taxes, countered by Scott from Cleveland's perspective on handling offensive content around his child.  The conversation broadened to political correctness, free speech, and parental responsibility, featuring calls from other listeners and "Sax God," who debated a previous offensive incident on a jazz radio program.  Several PSAs addressing the use of various slurs were played and discussed.

A segment was sparked by a Jane Lynch PSA against using the R-word, devolving into a highly offensive conversation using racial, homophobic, and ableist slurs.  The hosts and caller Danielle debated the acceptability of these words, touching upon Louis C.K. and Rick Crom's use of offensive language.  Other tangents included Danielle's profession (legally pimping pharmaceuticals), a sexually explicit description of "City Jerks," a critique of Donald Trump's Oscars reaction to Sacha Baron Cohen, Jonah Hill's promotional choices, and personal celebrity anecdotes.  Opie and Anthony discussed their Shorty Award nominations.  Voice clips of Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, Nick Swartzen, and Dimitri Martin were played.

The show continued with a discussion of sneaker culture and the practice of buying expensive sneakers for resale. Caller Brian explained the urban context of this practice, followed by speculation about Opie's purported rejection of *Dancing with the Stars*.  The hosts debated participation in various reality shows (*Big Brother*, *The Amazing Race*, *Survivor*, *Tough Enough*, *Wipeout*).  The segment concluded with a discussion of diets and weight loss, featuring profanity from Sam Roberts and Roland and anecdotes about maintaining healthy lifestyles while managing stress.

Finally, a segment focused on relentlessly teasing Eric Nagel about his weight, linking it to his wife's attractiveness and perceived sexual inadequacies.  The hosts used crude language to describe sexual acts and Eric's potential failings,  hypothetically discussing Troy sleeping with Eric's wife if he didn't lose 20 pounds.  Sexually suggestive comments about themselves were made, including a discussion of an "E-Rock boner alarm". The segment ended with the hosts emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, suggesting Eric's wife was considering infidelity due to his weight and lack of effort.  The exchange included mentions of Ericâ€™s wife texting him about buying him a bicycle and a humorous reference to a "Simpsons cave".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m., an out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fucking have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  People are angry right now.  Dude, I was getting Twitter some people that said, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  I woke up with this in my head the second my eyes opened. 
[00:01:30]  Wait, we're forgetting something.  Yes.  So, is it this great?  So.  I woke up with this in my head the second my eyes opened.  And literally just started laughing.  I was laughing and had to, out loud, I had to go,  and it made me laugh more.  And then driving in, I was singing in my car the Alice theme.  It just, I don't know what it is about these two things that make me laugh so much. 
[00:02:00]  It's just so terrible.  They're horrid.  And people seem to have really enjoyed it yesterday.  They're embracing it.  The tweets are hilarious.  People are so angry.  Womp, womp, womp.  I think I wrote ten womps and then F you.  It just pissed people off.  Oh, fuck.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Top of the morning, D.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard. 
[00:02:30]  Welcome aboard.  Fucking leap day.  And I wasn't thinking about it at all,  but Kevin from Connecticut reminds us that leap day last year,  Patrice got Dr. Z to wear a strap on and lied about letting her fuck him.  That was more than a year ago, right?  And he sighed Dave.  Last leap year.  Last leap year.  Oh, oh.  And he sighed Dave shoved a black dildo up his own ass.  Wow.  He gave himself ass to mouth.  Well, I'm sure today it'll be just as outrageous here in the studio.  We should just march down the hall and ask if we could do that exact same bit today. 
[00:03:00]  Nine.  And see what they say.  Well, it's leap day.  We got to do some shit.  That was four years ago.  This only comes around every four years.  Fuck, man.  I was out that day.  I remember it.  And I remember being really turned on when I found out that Dr. Z, I saw the pictures of her.  Yeah.  Because she was so dirty.  I didn't know she was so dirty.  Oh, yeah.  She was going to stick a fucking dildo up someone's ass.  That's fucking crazy that that was that long ago.  Four years ago.  Fuck, man.  So we'll take your leap day ideas.  What happens?  Huh?  What happens with time? 
[00:03:30]  Time happens.  But it goes fast now.  It does.  It was going at a relatively deal-withable rate.  Unnoticed.  You didn't notice it.  Yeah.  It's kind of like that.  I was going to say unnoticed.  Yeah, that's a couple of years, whatever.  Now it's just like, ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man.  So you're your boy Romney.  I like saying you're boy Romney.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Hey, you've made it very well known.  You like the Republicans.  I am not Romney or Santorum or anybody. 
[00:04:00]  It's whoever the Republicans choose.  If they choose, some weird thing happens and Ron Paul becomes the candidate, I'll be a Ron  Paul guy.  It's whoever the Republicans choose.  That's who I'm voting for.  I just enjoy saying you're boy Romney.  I know.  Because he's just not a strong candidate.  He just isn't.  Well, he seems to be a competitor.  It doesn't mean he's going to lose the election.  I mean, a lot of polls say it's going to be a very close election if it's Romney and Obama.  But I just enjoy saying you're boy Romney because I know you're a little sad inside. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  I'm just like, ah.  I know you're a little sad inside.  I just know it.  I would love to be able to vote for an independent whose ideology and their whole platform I agree  with and actually believe in.  Right.  But there's nobody that's like that that I actually could vote for and think he could win.  Now, do I want to have this moral victory by saying, well, at least I voted for somebody I believe. 
[00:05:00]  That's like in the perfect world you should be able to do that and he should have a chance to win.  Right.  But that isn't the world we live in.  Right.  So you have your two parties and you have to vote for the one that you either want to win or vote for the one that's against the one you don't want to win.  And that's the position I'm in.  I can't vote for Obama.  So I got to vote for the other guy.  I liked your Twitter last night because people were giving you suggestions. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you just kept saying, I would vote for him.  I'd vote for him.  I'm trying to remember some of them.  It was the Palin.  They thought Palin and then what's her name?  Well, they started with Romney.  I would vote for him.  Say it to him.  I would vote for him.  Ron Paul.  I would vote for him.  And then people are like, well, what if it's Palin Bachman?  Palin Bachman.  I would vote for him.  Palin Bachman.  I was like, I vote for fucking Margot Kidder and Anne Hesch.  Right.  That ticket of fucking nut jobs that we found in people's yards wandering around before I'll vote for Obama. 
[00:06:00]  It's just the way it is.  I just love that the people were trying to break you down at every time.  I would vote for him.  I would vote for him.  I would vote for him.  That's me.  I would vote for a clam and an orange.  I would vote for him.  Put it on the fucking ballot.  Right.  I would vote for him.  I'm voting.  You can just see how mad people get.  Oh, they were getting mad.  Because they're trying to break you down to admit, no, you wouldn't vote for him.  Yeah.  But how did he do, Romney?  Was he good?  Romney, it was close, but, you know.  Not as close as they thought it was going to be. 
[00:06:30]  Well, fucking, they teased everyone yesterday.  I was watching the results come in.  And at one point, Santorum was leading by a thousand votes, and that margin was hanging  in there.  Yeah.  But they already knew that it was a little, you know, it was all Romney.  Yeah, they knew that the next area that was going to come in was all Romney.  Yeah, I think they were picking certain areas to report first just to keep your interest.  And then it was so obvious that Romney was going to win this damn thing. 
[00:07:00]  So, it was a close victory, but like Romney said, a victory is a victory.  Yep.  He needed those to put him back in the forefront of the race like this.  I don't know.  Like I said, once they have a candidate, after all this shit where they beat each other up  and the polls go back and forth, it'll be a lot easier.  No.  You know, because now it's just, and the mainstream media is really beating up these 
[00:07:30]  guys.  They're kind of laughing.  Like, we have this dumbass fuck NBC, MSNBC on every morning, and all they do is come  on at six, play some clips from Romney and Santorum and Gingrich, and then sit there when  they come back from the clips, and they're all laughing, and they're like, oh boy, those  Republicans, oh Jesus.  And I just, I really would like to see them win just to see the people's faces.  They would get really depressed.  They'd look like me four years ago.  They're convinced that Obama's got this thing. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, they're convinced.  They just feel that Romney's a weak candidate.  Now, we do have some, you know, problems there with our candidates.  I do understand this.  But Obama is in a really bad position, because the country's kind of fucked.  You know, the only thing that's doing well right now seems to be the stock market, and  that's pretty much the private sector.  Oh, I got one.  Yeah.  What if Obama was a Republican? 
[00:08:30]  A clone of Obama going against Obama.  A Republican?  Oh, no, that would be easy.  You would have to just...  What's his...  Yeah, I would go...  I would go Republican Obama.  But you would have to vote for a black guy.  I'd go Bizarro Obama.  But then you would have to vote for a black guy.  Well, I'd have no problem voting for a black guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'd have voted for Colin Powell if he, you know, would have come on board years ago.  Wouldn't say no problem.  Well, all right, slight problem.  There would be a problem.  Pulling that handle. 
[00:09:00]  Sweating.  Exactly.  I'd sweat on my brow as I go to pull that handle.  Thank God.  And go, sorry, Daddy.  Why?  You're like pulling the blue wire out of a bomb.  You're not sure?  You'd be fucking praying to Daddy.  Oh, please, Daddy.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  This is terrible.  I'm sorry I'm doing this, but I had no choice.  Ah, fucking...  We gotta play the Reverend Al clip.  Oh, my God.  Reverend Al has decided that he's gonna do bits now on his dumb show on MSNBC. 
[00:09:30]  I'm doing shtick!  He's doing bits.  Yeah.  And we got the bit.  And it's him with a telephone in front of him.  And I guess the telephone was supposed to ring.  Is he Bob Newhart now?  One of the phone bits.  And, uh...  Yeah, you're supposed to hear...  When you hear him go, what, what, what?  Like he's confused in the middle of his little...  Yeah, but I said...  Right there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's...  You're supposed to hear a phone ringing.  Right.  Because he looks down at this oldie time telephone.  Like he's being interrupted by a phone ring. 
[00:10:00]  Like he's being interrupted.  But the phone ain't even ringing.  Right.  They can't even get that part of the bit right.  Right.  So they can't even figure that out.  And then once you realize and fill in the blanks that he's supposed to be getting a phone call,  then the bit starts and it is horrendous.  I love that the world gets to see that he really is just a fucking clown in the end.  Yeah.  He's just a fucking clown.  This proves it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he's clueless.  He thinks this bit is working.  Such a bad actor in a little comedy bit.  All right.  Get ready for some douche chills.  Reverend Al from last night.  At the end of his show, he decided he needed to do this bit. 
[00:10:30]  Finally tonight, I want to talk to you about something that's very important to me and the folks here at Politics Nation.  You know, I don't know who that was.  Sorry for the interruption.  What was I saying?  Pause.  We got to just pause.  He's looking down at the phone like the phone distracted him, but it's just sitting there not ringing.  I don't know who that was.  Nothing happened.  Yeah, nothing happened, you idiot.  It was all the white people that like you.  Right. 
[00:11:00]  Go backwards to that.  So he interrupts himself, looks down at the phone.  That's not ringing.  He goes, I don't know who that was.  The interruption.  What was I saying?  The issue is something we've covered an awful lot here.  Excuse me for one second.  Hello?  I guess it rang again.  Yeah.  This is an audio problem.  What?  On the TV show, there was other, you can't even hear the other voice now. 
[00:11:30]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  What?  Oh my God.  What's he doing, Ophie?  I don't know.  What's Sam doing?  Sam, you all right?  Sam, are you okay?  I...  What are you...  You're panicking.  What do you mean?  I see it in your face.  What do you thought?  Sal, he just got all red.  I just see it in his face.  You realize you just talked...  Words just came out.  You didn't just think that.  What happened?  What do you think?  What do you think?  What happened?  I'm in a paranoid state right now.  I'm not used to things happening on this computer that aren't my fault. 
[00:12:00]  What are you talking about?  What happened?  You just...  You said something that was...  Wait, explain what you're...  What happened?  The audio problem is going on with this clip.  What audio problem?  There's no ringing on the phone.  The audio problems...  The only thing audio problems are in that microphone on my right.  Is he going crazy?  Dude, is he okay?  I don't know.  It's me yesterday and today.  What's going on?  Sam, are you okay?  Maybe not.  I don't know.  Are you all right?  I'm okay. 
[00:12:30]  Somebody's unraveling because he's getting married.  He's unraveling.  I don't care about getting married.  He's unraveling.  Sam, did you hear us talking about the clip?  Yeah.  And the fact that there was no ring.  No, that's why this thing is so awful.  There's no phone ringing.  We already explained the fact that he's doing the thing.  I saw this clip live last night.  There's no phone ringing.  But in a clip I saw there was a phone ringing, I'm saying.  What?  What clip did you see?  But where did you get your clip?  From MSNBC, the TV feed. 
[00:13:00]  Did they put the clip in later?  Maybe they fixed it later.  I don't know.  They probably fixed it later.  Because it went out live like this.  Yeah, this is how it went out live.  I saw it this morning.  I didn't see it live.  So they could have fixed it later.  Holy fuck.  I have a version with the ring, I'm saying.  All right.  All right.  I'm just glad that you're okay.  He might have crawled out of that barrel with that.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Thank God you're okay.  So he's watching a clip that doesn't have the sound of the clip that you have.  Okay.  This felt so bad that before the replay of the show, they obviously fixed it up. 
[00:13:30]  They fixed it.  No, this is how I saw it.  Okay.  The phone doesn't fucking ring, which fucks up the bit horribly.  Then I'm sure I just saw the replay.  I'm just happy you're all right, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  That was scary.  Your face was creepy.  It was like a bertation.  I thought it was bertation.  Right.  I thought you were having a mini stroke in front of your eyes.  I prefer thinking Sam was having a mini stroke in front of your eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's something very wrong.  I liked your thing.  He was unraveling because he's getting married.  That's what I prefer.  Yeah.  Yeah, he don't give a fuck.  No, I don't care.  He doesn't care if he's married or not. 
[00:14:00]  No.  That's what it comes down to.  All right.  Go back now that you know.  Wow.  So the phone, yeah, I guess it was supposed to ring.  So they fixed it for the replay.  Right.  Because they realized how uncomfortable this was for everybody to watch.  All right.  The interruption.  What was I saying?  The issue is something we've covered an awful lot here.  Excuse me for one second.  Hello?  Join Democrats who are going to send a loud message to Massachusetts Mitt Romney.  I'm sorry to keep pausing. 
[00:14:30]  Pause.  And then we'll let it ride after this.  They didn't even have it queued up.  No, no.  It wasn't queued up right.  Now, did they fix that delay?  Delay?  No.  Delay wasn't fixed.  Why wouldn't they?  That would be an easy fix.  Yeah, you'd think they would really, like, fucking fix this clip up and make this bit  flow and work.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  What they should have done was just edit this whole bit out of the fucking rebroadcast.  Because to put this, to shorten that might fuck up the rest of the sound from the clip.  Right.  All you had to do was, like, go to a shot of the phone, do an edit, go back there. 
[00:15:00]  Right, right.  It would have been fine.  It would have been an easy fix, to be honest with you.  Yeah, something to take that time.  All right, now we'll let it ride.  I apologize.  So then he picks up the phone, and obviously that recorded message is supposed to start  right away, but it doesn't.  It's like another two-second delay.  So this bid is off to a horrendous start.  Democrats who are going to send a loud message to Massachusetts' Mitt Romney by voting for  Rick Santorum for president.  This call is paid for by Rick Santorum for president. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah, I've been hearing about this robocall all day.  Rick Santorum thinks he can woo Democrats to vote for him.  That's crazy.  But you know, this could be a lot of fun if the roles were reversed.  Let me give this a try.  Hello, Rick.  It's Revan Al.  I think you should spend a lot less time making phone calls and more time reading the Constitution.  This message has been paid for by the Blueberry Pie Super Pat. 
[00:16:00]  That was fun.  I know exactly who wants to hear from me today.  Suicide hotline.  Hey, Will, it's Revan Al.  Do yourself a favor and stop talking about Cadillacs.  This message has been paid for by the Blueberry Pie Super Pat.  Can you pause it real quick?  I have a question.  What is the Cadillac?  Why would...  Yeah, they've been playing the clip ad nauseum that Romney had to say that his wife drives two Cadillacs. 
[00:16:30]  A couple of Cadillacs, yeah.  Okay.  Kind of showing that he might be a little out of touch as far as voters go.  Was he trying to prove that he buys American?  Yeah, but he just, you know, just say, yeah, yeah.  He listed all the cars he drives and then ended it with, and my wife drives two Cadillacs.  All right.  So they're kind of harping on that a little bit.  Back it up slightly there, Sambo.  It's a good bit, right?  It's hilarious.  I think I'm getting the hang of this thing now. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no.  The hang of this now.  Are you?  I think I'm getting the hang of this thing now.  Not down to business.  This one is a long-distance one.  One is a long-distance one.  Hey, Jeb.  It's Reverend Al.  I heard the weather's beautiful in Florida this time of year.  Is that the ocean I hear in the background?  I'm calling to let you know that you should just stay on the beach and do absolutely nothing. 
[00:17:30]  This message has been paid for by the Blueberry Pie Super Pack.  Well, that was fun.  But it's time for me to call it quits.  But Rick Santorum is still on the show.  Oh, God.  He's terrible.  And then those idiots have to kind of laugh in the background. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, you know, they have to.  That was good, Al.  Good bit.  Why didn't they just edit the whole bit on the replay?  It didn't work.  And the edit on the replay was horrible because when he says, I wonder who that was.  The first time the phone rings, it's still ringing.  Oh, really?  It's still ringing when he says, I wonder who that was.  What a terrible audio department they have.  Oh, it's awful. 
[00:18:30]  MSNBC, all the fucking dregs.  He's a fucking cloud.  He's just a cloud, man.  And he's trying to do bits like that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I watched to get really fucking mad.  Hello, Steven Pagonis.  This is Reverend Al.  I still don't have your money.  For when you sued me for a slander and libel over the Tawana Brawley thing.  Ha, ha, ha.  Blueberry pie.  Blueberry pie.  Blueberry pie. 
[00:19:00]  Hello, Greek homos.  It's Reverend Al.  You all is homos.  Why don't you show blueberry pies up your assholes?  Blueberry pie.  Let me, you got another one there?  Yeah, I'm trying to think of all the dumb stuff Reverend Al said.  I'm sure we'll have a few money of it.  Marcos in Yonkers.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, bro.  Morning, Marcos.  Last night I was watching a Santorum speech, and I couldn't help but notice how his daughter 
[00:19:30]  looks like him, but with a wig on.  I said it weeks ago, man.  His daughter looks like a tranny.  Ha, ha, ha.  Really?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Yeah.  Marcos is right.  It looks exactly like Santorum with a wig on.  She's not handsome.  Aside from the lovely Bush daughters, I don't think we've had very attractive first daughters.  Well, Chelsea made a huge comeback.  Well...  A massive comeback. 
[00:20:00]  When Clinton was in office, she was hideous.  She's pretty hideous now.  Almost as bad as Amy Carter.  She's pretty fucking hideous now.  That Amy Carter?  No, that's Santorum's daughter.  Santorum's daughter?  Yeah.  There's another one where she's standing in the back as Santorum's talking last night.  Just look for yourself.  I mean, she is not...  She has some manly features to her.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's like a big head with little facial features in the middle.  She's tiny teeth.  He's piranha teeth.  Fucking eating fish food and praying to God. 
[00:20:30]  Nice fucking piranha face.  That picture isn't as bad.  She's all dollied up in that one.  She looks like Rikki Lake a little bit.  Like a little annoying fat girl with a giant...  Like her little...  She's not fat, though.  That's weird.  Well, she's got that big fucking head, but the facial features are really small in it.  Tiny face.  Looks weird, yeah.  Little teeny tiny...  Eensy, beansy, teeny tiny face.  Gotta be stretched out.  Santorum has tiny features.  Yeah.  You see how tiny his eyebrows are?  Bugs me.  Little tiny features. 
[00:21:00]  He's got a big nose and tiny eyes and tiny teeth.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah, look at it.  He does have a little tiny eyebrow.  That's his mouth wide open.  Yeah.  Looks like piranha.  So, we got to regroup from the Reverend Al bit.  Reverend Al.  He loves that blueberry pie thing.  That's like his catchphrase.  Blueberry pie.  He doesn't even understand how everyone's making fun of that.  Yeah.  He doesn't get it.  He loves it.  He doesn't get it at all.  He just loves attention.  He doesn't give a shit.  What's it called?  The blueberry pie super packed? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Super pack.  Pack.  Super pack.  P-A-C.  Yeah.  So, I was telling Ant that I'm not a big hockey fan these days, but I decided in between watching  the results, I would watch the third period of the Islanders game.  I just say this so people can laugh at me.  So, I go, ah, Islanders.  All right.  They're sort of trying to make a run at the playoffs.  They're kind of having an outside shot. 
[00:22:00]  They're leading the Capitals to zip with six minutes left in the game.  That's a win.  I'm like, I'm going to watch the rest of this fucking game, right?  The Capitals score.  It's 2-1.  Steven, as from Bayshore, was out of his mind as well.  And then, they pull the goalie, and the Capitals tie it with 20 seconds left in the fucking game.  The Islanders had a 2-0 lead with six minutes left.  Why do you pull a goalie?  What's the motive of that?  To get an extra skater on the ice so you have a better chance of scoring.  So, it's like a desperation move, usually. 
[00:22:30]  But in a lot of cases, it does work out for the team.  And then, they go to overtime, and the fucking Capitals win.  They win 3-2.  Whoops.  The Islanders were winning two zip with six minutes left.  Whoopsie.  How do you do that?  Huh?  How do you do that?  I don't know.  The Islanders do it all the fucking time.  It's just a terrible organization.  Yeah.  Anybody paying attention to hockey these days? 
[00:23:00]  Well, I mean, my team sucks, so it makes it harder.  I like watching hockey games, so.  I watched Sean William Scott's movie, Goon.  Yeah.  I liked it.  You good?  Yeah.  I just know what's coming up, and I'm just like, ugh.  What?  Brackets, brackets, brackets.  March Madness, brackets, brackets, brackets.  How's your brackets?  You pick your brackets, brackets?  Let's pick brackets.  I hate brackets.  Let's do it.  Fucking raging.  I fucking hate March Madness. 
[00:23:30]  It takes forever.  Everyone's talking about their brackets.  Yeah, but everyone's doing it out there.  Let's get some money on the table.  Let's do brackets.  God, I couldn't know.  Sam, can you set up some brackets?  I don't know anything about no goddamn brackets.  And let's hand out the sheets, and let's do this this year.  Brackets.  Who wants in?  Let's do brackets.  What's the bracket?  Let me see your brackets.  Who do you got in your brackets?  Brackets?  I can't even say brackets now.  It's not a word anymore.  I said it too much.  It sounds funny. 
[00:24:00]  Bracket, bracket, bracket.  But I got to make it clear.  This goon movie, I don't think it's going to have mainstream success.  I have to say.  It's a stark club soda, Kenny.  And if you change it, it's some of the people he used to beat up.  True.  I have to protect myself a little bit.  I like the movie because I like hockey, and it's very bloody.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of fights, and, I mean, they don't hold back, man.  There is blood just squirting out everywhere, smearing on the glass. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that's good.  Dripping on the ice, teeth falling out.  I mean, the hockey fights are fucking terrific.  I think hockey fans will love the movie, but I'm not really sure if it will find a mainstream audience.  Maybe it was just meant to be one of those indies.  It has an indie.  It absolutely has an indie feel to it.  Yeah.  You could tell, like, some of the hockey scenes that they probably only had 100 people for the day, and they kind of, like, filmed it in such a way where it looked like it was a full arena.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  They got to try to do that.  If you watch the original Rocky, behind the, you can see a half-empty, it's an empty arena.  Yeah.  You can look in the back on a couple of shots and see that there's all just black.  They're trying to darken it.  Yeah.  They try to make it really dark.  They were just in the dark.  There was nobody there, because, yeah, who the fuck was sliced alone back then?  Right.  So, I mean, good luck to Sean William Scott.  It's not a bad movie, that's for sure.  It's definitely not a bad movie.  Brackets.  Brackets. 
[00:25:30]  Brackets.  Brackets.  How are your brackets?  Show me your brackets.  Who do you got in the brackets?  Is that college sports or hockey?  March Madness.  It's college basketball.  I have no interest in it.  None.  I know nothing about it.  Well, I got UConn.  Do you?  Do you have UConn?  Oh, that's my father-in-law's team, and he's listening right now.  I had no idea.  Take it back.  He likes the UConn.  I had no idea that was University of Connecticut for years.  I thought it was literally the UConn in Canada.  Come on.  I thought the UConn. 
[00:26:00]  I'm not even kidding.  This is how little I know.  I thought the UConn had a basketball team.  We finally found something you don't know much about.  I know nothing.  You usually know a little bit about everything.  I would assume you knew what UConn was.  I had a watch years ago and, like, before, what was the name, Valvano, before he died?  Yeah.  So I was in during that period of time just because I was homeless and staying with a family that used to watch that all the time. 
[00:26:30]  So I kind of got like, oh, okay, what's that?  But that was it.  So maybe that's the problem.  When I see it, it reminds me of leaner times.  Well, we got a guy that wants to talk about bracketology.  Bracketology?  Yeah, it's a real thing, right, Jeff?  God.  Hey, Jeff in D.C., fuck your Capitals, by the way.  Hey, man, they're not even in the playoffs right now.  They're ninth.  They're not even in it.  Well, the Capitals are, yeah, they're ninth, and they need to get to eighth, obviously.  And someone's laughing at me because they said the Islanders have a chance at the playoffs. 
[00:27:00]  They said an outside chance.  Yeah, an outside chance.  Well, the Capitals always end up first and then fucked up in the first round.  So it could be worse.  It could be the Capitals.  And then it has to be Ovechkin, right, really, to fucking score in overtime?  Fuck you.  Fuck your Capitals.  Fuck your city.  What do you got for the show?  Hey, I just wanted to say if y'all want to, you know, include or get going on Anthony Bracket,  you can go to Chip again and we need the Bracketology, which is their horrible bid on studying Bracket. 
[00:27:30]  They run every March.  You always ask the president.  Oh, your Brackets.  What about who's, what are your Brackets?  All the Brackets.  That's where you put, like, who you think is going to play who and the winner will go, oh, who gives a fuck.  Well, it's great for betting, man.  Writers don't get paid, though.  I don't know why.  You hand out the Brackets and you fucking, you know, you hand in your sheet and see who does well.  Ron and Fez are big time into Brackets.  Are they college sports guys?  They'll do the Brackets, that's for sure. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  Yeah, the NCAA tournament's huge, man.  It is, but people fucking enjoy trying to figure this shit out.  If you said, like, people in those Brackets had a bus accident and killed everyone in those Brackets, it would mean nothing to me.  Nothing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm thinking I'm going to go with probably Mississippi State.  Yeah.  I'm going Ole Miss.  That's why we should do this now.  And then, uh...  These are the official Brackets.  Let me tell you, though, something. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, uh, Texas-Arlington?  Yeah.  That is a team this year.  Oh, boy.  Those are the...  See, this is what I just...  Oh, boy.  They got a problem, though, with the...  What's the problem?  The small forward, uh, this whole thing with the dribbling shin problems.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to go to, uh, Murray Street.  Uh-huh.  Uh, they're probably going to play, uh, Vanderbilt.  I'm thinking Drexel is, uh, going to do very well.  It's Murray State.  What?  Uh, yeah.  It's not Murray Street College.  Murray Street.  That's SPS State. 
[00:29:00]  Murray State.  I didn't do that on purpose either.  I just thought it was a very Jewish road.  Murray Street.  Murray Street.  Let's do Brackets now.  Murray Street.  Let's see how well you guys do.  Well, uh, you got to go, uh, Notre Dame.  Uh, you should first have to predict which 68 teams will make the bracket.  Oh, and then the fucking...  64.  What is it then?  68 on the other page.  Is it 68?  The thrilling 32?  The thrilling 34? 
[00:29:30]  And then what does it become?  The fucking...  The sweet 16?  What?  What do you mean it's 68?  And I hate the Elite Eight.  It should be the great eight.  How do you know it's the Elite Eight?  Ah, because I hear Brackets every year.  Bracket, bracket, bracket.  You're right about the Sweet 16.  It's Sweet 16.  The Elite Eight.  And then the final four.  But I think Sam got it...  And then the two.  But I think Sam got it wrong.  It's not 68.  And then Thunderdome.  Mathematically, it should be 64.  It's been 64 forever.  Some website just says 68.  I think you're right, but I don't know.  Maybe they've given some teams some buys. 
[00:30:00]  Buys?  Maybe they changed the rules.  I always remembered as 64.  You got to give New Mexico an outside chance on this whole thing.  I'm thinking, yeah, Kentucky, though.  Kentucky looking really good.  One of my favorite interviews of all time on this show was when we talked to that loudmouth...  I forgot his name.  Oh, loudmouth.  The fucking college basketball expert.  Iraq.  Oh, right, right, right.  The loudmouth.  Help me out.  Come on, Iraq.  Stop holding back. 
[00:30:30]  The guy that does the broadcasts.  We didn't know shit about it.  And we fucking skated through the interview.  Dick Vitale.  Thank you.  Dick Vitale.  Thank you, Vitale.  Revolving.  Remember we had him on and we had no fucking clue?  None.  And he kept going, oh, well, that's a very good observation.  Oh, yeah, because we just kept...  We just bullshitted our way through the entire fucking thing.  I'm digging the...  No clue.  All the way.  But though, all the way, I'm going with the Tar Heels.  Ooh, strong.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  I like the Tar Heels.  Yes.  That's a strong one.  You got to go with the Tar Heels.  This guy's going to explain why 68.  It used to be 64, Walt.  What's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Oh, by the way, fuck your devils.  I'm a flyer, Stan.  Oh.  Oh, you know what?  I'm taking a peek at the flyers.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Well, then fuck your lack of loyalty, sir.  I'm taking a peek just in case my Islanders move out.  If they move out, I might have to become flyers over the Rangers.  But no one gives a fuck about that.  Huh?  You don't have to take a peek.  You don't have to take a peek.  Just go with the flyers. 
[00:31:30]  Well, when the Islanders are officially eliminated, then I get to pick my second team.  And I think I will go with the fucking flyers this year.  Go ahead, Walt.  What do you got?  All right.  Well, as you know, the seeds are, you know, 1 through 16.  So they have 68 teams.  But the last eight teams play for the last four spots in the tournament.  Was it?  Oh, I get it.  So that makes it 64.  No, I don't get it.  They started it last year.  There's four play-in games.  They did.  Yeah.  So there's eight teams that turn into the last four. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  We can't talk about brackets.  We're losing everybody.  That's fine.  So last year they went from 64 to 68.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, it ends up being 64.  64.  Gotcha.  Yeah, because mathematically it doesn't work with 68 if you start with 68.  No.  They choose, I think, like, you know, 60 teams get in and then there's eight teams that play these play-in games.  And they become the last four teams.  Why do they need to do that?  64 fucking teams.  It's for lower schools.  It's for the gambling fuckers.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:32:30]  That too.  Why would you need to bring more fucking schools into this thing?  64 spots is a lot of spots.  More schools, more TV, more ratings.  I guess.  Oh.  All right, Walt.  Thank you, sir.  Appreciate it.  Appreciate it a lot.  You know, Spartans are looking really good this year, too.  You like the Spartans, huh?  I don't know.  The Spartans, Tar Heels, I'm, you know.  Spartans have been plagued with injury problems.  The center's got a thing.  Yeah, he's got a bone spur. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  What about Long Beach Street?  Street?  Street.  Yeah, you got to get those glasses.  I love that.  Hey, you want to bet on Ibarro or Iona?  Oh, no, it's Iona.  Not I-own-uh.  It's all Iona this year.  No.  You're going all Iona?  It's a Cinderella story.  No, they don't have a shot.  By that, it means they wear slippers, you see.  They're 24-6.  I think they're 24-6.  They don't have a shot.  They've already lost six games.  I think. 
[00:33:30]  Is that where it is?  That's how, yeah.  Yeah, those teams never win it.  Hey, Iraq, do you have the Dick Vitale interview?  Because someone is bringing up the point where he was all monotone because he didn't think he was on the air.  And then when we finally said, no, you're on the air, he ramped it up.  I just want to play that part for people if you can find it.  Yeah, let me skim through it.  It's from March of 2005.  What?  Oh, my God.  That's seven years ago.  I've had it with time.  I've had it with time. 
[00:34:00]  How is that possible?  I feel like we did that two years ago.  Maybe not last year, but two years ago.  That's five months into satellite radio.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have guessed that.  I'd have guessed, yeah.  What was that?  A couple of years?  That means those guys that he was talking about are now 30 years old.  Little college kids playing for the championship.  Oh, my God.  They're all pushing 30, I would say.  Look.  What the fuck?  Well, everything that happened in the old studio is at least how long ago?  We're pushing three years here. 
[00:34:30]  Three years in April.  Three years in this building?  So you've got to tack three years on to everything.  Three years in this building with absolutely nothing changing.  Nothing's happened in three years.  Not one thing.  That stupid fucking bald-headed prick.  Bob Kelly?  He goes to me after the show.  You want to talk about lights?  I go, no, I don't want to talk about lights.  And I'm sorry.  I go, talk to Anthony about lights.  I'm done talking about lights.  I said that was probably one of the most underrated Journey songs.  I like it, though, and I will leave it on the radio when it comes on. 
[00:35:00]  I'm done talking.  Yeah.  You want to talk to Anthony about it?  Not on the radio, but I'm done talking.  He goes, you want to talk about lights?  I'm like, what year is this?  We've been asking for new lights for six months.  You want to talk about lights?  You want action.  Just make the lights better.  I don't know about lights.  I don't either.  I have some in my studio at home, and that made me an expert in their eyes for some reason.  So they want to consult with me.  I don't see a green screen in here, so I don't know what the fuck about lights. 
[00:35:30]  These lights are fine.  Yeah.  I'm fine with it.  They go, you want to talk about lights?  I'm like, no.  We've done enough talking.  Now just make the lights better.  We were watching you leave in a hurry yesterday, and Roland was eavesdropping and came back in here to report that you had said, no, I'm not talking.  Talk to Ant.  Yeah.  I had to go somewhere yesterday.  I had to be somewhere.  Hey, you got some gas?  I don't want to go through this.  What?  This is what should have happened six months ago.  We need better lights in the studio. 
[00:36:00]  You go find a fucking expert.  This is what I suggest, and then you get the lights done.  Then you get it.  Don't talk to us about it.  I don't know shit about lights.  I just know these lights suck.  We say we need them.  Then you talk to people that know the best about it.  They ask me and Tom Green.  Yeah, yeah.  You're an expert on lights now.  I was the original expert on lights.  I do remember they chewed Tom Green's ear off about lights as well.  Lights.  Enough about the lights.  They're like the brackets.  But he was repeating himself like he does when he's joking.  Like he just repeats the words.  Who? 
[00:36:30]  Tom Green.  Yeah.  So nobody knew if he was kidding about the lights.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He does that.  He does that.  He repeats the words.  Tom Green's got the same voice.  He goes, I think you should get the, you know.  Everglow.  Everglow lights.  Everglow lights.  Everglow.  Everglow.  Everglow.  I use Everglow.  Do you use Everglow?  Buy the Everglow.  He's fucking around again.  Yeah, he's fucking with us.  And then I hear that they said I didn't want to talk about the Cleveland broadcast, which  was complete bullshit.  We had a five-minute conversation about that yesterday morning when me and Ed were supposed  to be prepping for the radio show. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  I told him exactly what I want.  I said, we don't want people just sitting around on table.  You know, with tables.  We want them to be able to drink.  And we want a big room.  I laid out the whole plan for these guys.  And then I hear from somebody that will remain nameless.  Oh, he said you didn't want to talk about it.  We had a whole conversation about it yesterday morning.  Uh-oh.  We don't want a hard rock situation where everyone's just sitting at tables and they're  not allowed to drink.  We don't want a controlled situation. 
[00:37:30]  No.  We want as many people that want to come to the live broadcast when we go to Cleveland  for Jim Norton's.  Period.  And we don't want a small room.  We want a nice big room.  Cleveland steamer bit.  Huh?  Especially if we're going to do the Cleveland steamer bit.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure we will.  There's a couple of rooms in the...  Yeah, there's a big room.  We want the biggest room.  With the balcony.  I know exactly what we want.  You know, I've worked that room.  It's actually not bad at all.  And I told them all this.  But then I have to hear from someone, oh, they said you didn't even want to talk about  it. 
[00:38:00]  That's bullshit.  Yeah.  Why don't you want to talk about it?  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Let's talk about it.  I'm going to fucking strangle somebody.  Can we play the goon clip that I saw you put up earlier?  Yes.  I want to help sell Sean William Scott's movie.  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  And hockey fans seem to really like this movie.  Yeah, hockey fans love any hockey movie.  Huh?  Hockey fans love any hockey movie.  Yeah.  Because there's so few of them.  Yes, there's few of them. 
[00:38:30]  You know, the fans are movies.  They always bring up Slapshot.  You know, they always bring that one.  It's the best hockey movie.  Yeah, it is.  Is this the trailer?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  The one scene that I loved will not be in the trailer.  No?  When they all wanted a sign showing William Scott's dick.  Pause.  Yes, there he is.  Because I got to help sell this movie.  Because I guarantee they're not going to put it in the trailer.  So they want to initiate him onto the team.  So they all want to sign his dick.  And so William Scott's like, I'm not fucking showing you my dick. 
[00:39:00]  And they all go, what are you, gay?  We should do that here.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, Travis.  Run that past the...  You'll be fine if we all put our dicks on a table.  And they kind of crossed over each other.  They're like hands in a circle.  And you're going to go like, go, go, team.  All right, let's play the trailer.  For the goon.  Or goon.  You have your show.  And my dad and my brother, they have their doctor's on.  Everybody's got something in there.  Come, sir.  Let's just go watch the assassins.  I'll fill you up with corn dogs. 
[00:39:30]  What is he?  Wrecking gun!  Oh, he's going up in the stands.  Hit us over here.  Oh, out of one.  Goon!  Goon!  Goon!  Goon!  Goon!  Goon!  Goon!  Doug, you pressed the hell out of me last night.  Come down to the ring for a tryout.  No, you're not joining the Oscar page, right, buddy?  You're not trying enough to lose.  You've been touched by the fist of God.  What number you want to wear? 
[00:40:00]  69!  Take the number 69!  It's hilarious!  Got y'all from the stand-up.  You're not here to play hockey.  You're here to fight.  It's hilarious.  This is one step under the beat.  No glory holes here tonight!  Hi, I'm Doug Glass.  Two rules, man.  Stay away from my percocets, and do you have any percocets, all right?  What in the hell can you take to these guys?  You are dumb.  I'm on your team!  I'm here to do whatever they need me to do.  They need me to please, but I'll lose for my team. 
[00:40:30]  You can do anything.  Except punch people.  What do I know?  You're like the Hebrew Dolph Wonder.  Doug, I dig hockey players.  The violence, the beer.  No, I'm horny a lot.  Boss, the boss, but Ray.  He is the master.  You have my respect.  If ever there comes a time when it gets down to you and me, I will lay you out, kid.  This has all the elements of a sports masterpiece. 
[00:41:00]  Ray?  Yes.  Thank you for asking.  This is about to get ugly.  Come on, Dougie!  That looks pretty good.  You want to go?  Yeah.  Okay.  Good luck, man.  Good luck to you too, bud.  Knock him out.  They're really, uh, they're absolutely not trying to get anything done with this movie.  No fucking message. 
[00:41:30]  It's just a lot of fucking hockey fights.  If they don't show the blood in the trailer, the blood was really impressive.  The end is exactly how it happens.  They just sit there before face-off.  Hey, you want to go?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you mean?  That's what they say?  You want to fight?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  You want to go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  I didn't know that was it.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What if one guy goes, no?  Enforcers usually know who, you know, who's going to go.  Who's going to go.  They kind of respect each other.  Yeah.  There's a whole...  It's part of the game.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Just to get everyone fucking pumped up. 
[00:42:00]  You want to go?  Like, so are they really punching each other and trying to knock each other's teeth out?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they're just animals.  They don't care.  They almost want their teeth knocked out.  Yeah, but the rules have been so, like, you know, diluted over the years that, I mean,  the second somebody almost slips on the ice...  Yeah, now they break it up.  Yeah, now they break it up.  Right.  But they're trying to get fighting out of the minor...  Which league?  It hit yesterday.  Pussy league.  No, it hit yesterday.  Yeah, they're trying to get to ban fighting. 
[00:42:30]  Fuck, I need my hockey fans.  You want to go?  Wow.  Which is a big deal.  You never...  Yeah.  Well, they say you want to go for no reason or, like, if something's been happening.  Both.  Sometimes they just want to fucking get the game going, you know, on the right foot.  They're not afraid to get punched in the face, these guys.  No, not at all.  Dude, you see these guys up close, they're fucked up.  They got scars all over the place.  Because most times, just like Sean and Scott's character, they're on the team for that purpose.  Just to goon it up.  Yeah.  But there's less of those guys, unfortunately.  Yeah, there's far less than there.  Every team had at least one goon on roster. 
[00:43:00]  Where, like...  Oh, that's what goon is.  Okay.  When he went on the ice, it was because he was going to basically fight.  Like, and they showed in the movie, Sean William Scott could barely skate.  But a lot of the guys in the NHL, their skating skills are horrendous.  They're there just to be enforcers and beat the shit out of someone.  So when the guy hits the ice as a fan, you're like, all right, cool.  Something's going down immediately.  So when they do it, like, it's like, say, we're on a team.  And say, let's say Sam fucking slides into somebody and the guy elbows him in the face. 
[00:43:30]  And I'm the enforcer.  Now, they know Sam's a twink who can't defend himself.  So they send in the enforcer to deal with the guy who elbowed him.  Yeah.  A lot of that goes on.  That guy knows when the enforcer comes in, he's coming for me.  Yes.  And they also know that, you know, Sam's not going to fight.  You know, he's not going to take the bait.  Right.  And they can also...  But the other team has their enforcer, too.  So if I go after...  Or the guy goes after the guy who elbowed girly pussy, twat boy Sam. 
[00:44:00]  Hypothetically.  Unfortunately, the enforcer is slowly going away.  You would agree with that, right?  Oh, absolutely.  It used to be, you know, when I was younger and watching hockey, it was all about the fucking enforcer.  Who's the toughest enforcer ever?  Wow.  Well, one of them.  Well, I mean, back when I was really into hockey, Clark Gillies was a fucking animal.  He showed me a wrestling enforcer. 
[00:44:30]  The enforcer Arn Anderson was the toughest enforcer.  The enforcer Arn Anderson was the toughest enforcer.  His name in wrestling was the enforcer?  Yeah.  He was the enforcer of the Four Horsemen, Arn Anderson.  Let me say hi to Scott.  Look at this guy.  Scott!  I've never heard those words before.  Scott!  Yellow.  Good evening.  Are you there, sir?  Yellow.  And Turbang has a thing about hockey enforcers, if you want to go there.  I was trying to give Ronnie a plug today, but this guy is a dildo? 
[00:45:00]  A dildo, sure.  The iBang on Twitter.  All right.  I never knew there was an enforcer in hockey.  Oh, yeah.  I never knew.  And I'm just busy adding my Weight Watchers meal.  What?  I joined Weight Watchers.  Oh.  Oh.  What's wrong with you?  I'm going to hand something to my Weight Watchers.  What?  Why would you do that? 
[00:45:30]  Do you have an app?  I do, but I do it at home on my computer.  Oh.  But I do have an app.  Those Jennifer Hudson commercials finally get you?  No.  I'm just shooting at the end of April, so I want to lose.  Yourself?  Yes, with cum.  I'm losing, I want to lose, I don't think I'll lose 20 pounds, but I want to lose like  about 15.  Yeah.  So I said 20 is my goal weight, and I joined yesterday, and I did all my little tracking. 
[00:46:00]  This, my calories, and this, and this.  Oh.  I can have this little ice cream bar at four points, so isn't that delish?  It's the point system you're on there?  Yeah, points are pretty easy.  You got, you asked a question, so it's coming like crazy.  Marty McSorley was an amazing enforcer.  Nick Fatio, of course, from the Rangers.  Ty Domi was one of my favorites of all fucking time.  When he played the Islanders, I just loved that he was fighting my team.  I didn't give a fuck.  That guy was an animal. 
[00:46:30]  A short animal, too.  So there you go.  There's a few of them from the past.  I didn't even know it existed.  There's the Jennifer Hudson commercial.  Yeah.  You believe.  Someone told me the point system.  Oh, Jonathan, my manager, he does it.  He goes, you can actually lose weight with the points, and you don't feel deprived because  you are eating.  It's just portion control, and you're eating.  You're getting points.  You know.  Is this a new bit or a sponsor?  Yeah.  What is this?  Is this a sponsor?  Yeah, no.  You're sliding it into the show.  It's pretty good.  That's really good. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I want to, I just want to drop a few pounds.  I go to the gym a lot, but just the eating.  You know, guys, it's all diet.  And I've been eating very late, so I knew what I ate yesterday, and I was a few points  short because I went to the gym, so I have a few points saved up.  Oh, the gymnasium.  The points carry over?  No.  You get extra points for the week, apparently.  Like, I have something, not to go on for too long, but I have something, which I'm going 
[00:47:30]  to call my breakfast.  I saved it in my favorites as a meal because, uh...  Well, it sounds like no fun now.  No, it is, actually.  Oh, God.  It's horrible.  No, it's, dude, you don't understand.  I'm having fun right now.  Yeah?  My app is open.  You can't be having fun.  I'm having more fun than you can imagine right now, but I don't know how to work the app.  Do you need a Weight Watcher buddy?  Because a lot of people are calling in, including Megan, who has a very sexy voice from D.C. 
[00:48:00]  Hi, Megan.  You want to talk to her real fast?  Yeah.  Hey, baby.  Hey, Megan.  How you doing?  Megan.  Jimmy, I want to be your Weight Watcher buddy.  Oh.  Just what I want.  Weight Watcher buddy.  We could email each other, like, low-point recipes, and we could send each other inspirational  messages.  Well, it all depends now.  Let's see.  How many points a day do you get?  Um.  400.  How many points a day do you get? 
[00:48:30]  22.  22?  That's not much.  Yeah, I know.  Girls don't get much.  How much do you weigh, and what are you trying to get down to?  I'm just trying to lose 10 pounds.  From what to what?  145 to 135.  Oh, boy.  How tall are you?  Yeah, how tall are you?  5'6".  All right.  You're on my chart.  You're good.  She's all right.  You're good.  See, I only do point systems, though, if the girl is pretty.  Are you pretty, Megan?  What do you look like? 
[00:49:00]  What celeb would you say you most resemble?  Um, I could send Jimmy a picture.  All right.  The real Jim Norton at gmail.com.  There you go.  Okay.  And I'll see, I'll know before I open it if I see that the fucking gigabyte storage in my email has changed.  There's his daughter.  See what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I have to hang up to send it.  Okay, sweetheart.  I don't know what this buddy thing is.  Dial up.  But, uh, I'm trying to find my tracker from here. 
[00:49:30]  I have a little breakfast I put in.  And I can't find it.  Oh, it's just lots of fun.  You're just going to love it.  You get all these little candles.  Weight Watchers sucks.  I heard it works.  Yeah, but then you lose the weight and you haven't learned anything.  And then you go back to fucking being fat.  That's the problem with diets.  Yeah, that's true.  But if you exercise, which I do, but you don't learn anything.  You do.  You're following a formula like, oh, I've lost the weight.  I guess I'm good now.  And you don't want to continue with the Weight Watcher bullshit.  So you go back to eating regularly.  And this is what happens.  People gain the weight back almost 90% of the time. 
[00:50:00]  But you get a feel for what the healthy portions are and how much each thing is if you're doing it right.  It's a known fact, though.  Most people go back to gaining weight right after their diet is done.  I don't need a lot of encouragement going into a diet.  But I would have to say that that's not at all an encouragement answer.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I've got to say you're going to fail.  No, I'm not discouraged.  Because I think a lot of people think, okay, they're losing the weight forever. 
[00:50:30]  Like, okay, I got that gene out of my body or whatever the fuck it is.  And that's how Weight Watchers stays in business because then they go back.  Right.  Although I â€“ never mind.  I can't be poor.  Oh, boy.  Weight Watchers discussion.  What?  What happened?  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  It's wrong.  What?  Come on.  You eat those snacks?  Their snacks are good.  Four points?  I had two of those motherfuckers.  I eat their â€“  Two of them.  I eat their â€“  Yo, ask me how many of those fucking giant cookie fucking Oreo cookie ice cream treats.  How many?  I had two of them motherfuckers. 
[00:51:00]  Eight points, bitch.  I'm embarrassed to say that I have enjoyed the Weight Watchers ice cream.  Yeah.  I discovered it one day.  I'm not doing Weight Watchers, but one day it was in the house.  It was the raspberry chocolate.  Yeah, those fucking things.  Oh, boy.  Not those.  Those look fruity.  Well, they are.  Maybe I didn't mean Sam and Travis.  We're right down there.  Oh, Sam, you almost had it, and you clicked on the wrong one. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, Sam.  Down below.  Down.  Right there.  I eat those things.  What are they called?  Could you fuck yourself?  Oh.  They're called Weight Watchers â€“  Dark chocolate raspberry.  Oh, they're fucking â€“  I bet you they're four points each, right?  I eat two.  Yeah.  How many fucking points am I eating?  Just two.  Total of eight.  Hey, I have two points each.  Oh.  So it's four points?  Just four points.  How many calories?  I work with calories, not points.  Just two points.  Well, what kind of calories and points tie in?  I mean, that's how they â€“  Dude, you could â€“ there's a list of every â€“ 
[00:52:00]  Are you still there, Megan?  Because I have a question.  When you're looking for something, you have a list.  You can go like Ritz crackers, how many.  Like, it's pretty specific, so you are dealing with calories.  But let me ask you.  I had 33 points a day I get, and I used 29 yesterday.  I have four remaining.  Enough pints.  Wait.  Wait.  You're doing rollover points?  No.  Oh, you're scaring me.  No, I'm saying what I used yesterday.  You said 29 points yesterday, so today's a new day.  Yeah, start over.  Are you done with the 29 points?  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm just â€“  Oh, my God.  That's so many points. 
[00:52:30]  I'm so jealous.  You scared me that you were going to roll over your four points to today.  Don't do it, Jimmy.  Don't do it.  I'm not.  But I have my four points.  I have weekly remaining 49.  Activity earned three.  Activity remaining three.  What is â€“  Don't do those activity points.  Don't do those.  What is an activity points?  What are they?  I would gather if you exercise, you're allowed more points.  Yes.  Yeah, but you just should ignore that, and then you'll lose weight better.  How do you know if you're using your activity points?  It will say you're using your activity points.  What does that mean?  Exercising? 
[00:53:00]  You just have â€“ it's like part of your little â€“ do you have your slider, Jimmy?  You have your little paper slider thing?  What's a paper slider?  Noah, what is this?  How are you going to be able to go on a date?  Oh, God.  What do you mean?  You're going to have to break out your apps and your sliders.  Oh, God.  I'll know exactly what we're getting.  Oh, my God.  You can't do this.  Yes, I can.  I'll be like â€“  I don't think guys are supposed to do this.  I need a Weight Watchers buddy.  I'll call you up.  I'll be like, man, I'm thinking of having ice cream.  You got to come lock my tongue. 
[00:53:30]  You got to come train the cup.  I know I'm old.  I'm going to have ice cream.  I was like, wait, God.  But you're single and you're dating.  You can't do this to yourself.  That's why I want to look better.  I mean, I'm a sweater boy cutie motherfucker, and I want to look really svelte in my sweaters.  You look pretty good now.  I know.  I know.  Look at those dark chocolate raspberry fucked.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm cuckold eating those.  Thank you.  It sounds awful.  It's low-fat ice cream dipped in a dark chocolate flavored coating. 
[00:54:00]  Those are good.  I'm telling you.  I didn't notice the difference.  Excellent.  Those are good.  How many fucking calories?  I didn't notice the difference.  80 calories.  Per?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Ice cream.  So did you send me, yo, when you send me that picture, yo, I'll get back.  I'll hit you up for some Weight Watcher buddy talk, if you know what I mean.  Where do you live, Megan?  D.C.  Oh, okay.  Woody in Philly goes, holy shit, I'm a fat pig.  Weight Watchers gives me 65 points a day. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that a lot?  That's twice Jimmy.  You're going to be like over 300 pounds.  Yeah.  You're going to get 65 points.  Oh, oh.  I didn't feel like I ate too much yesterday at all.  Did you go into a Weight Watchers place?  No, I just went online.  I'm not going to a meeting.  I don't need that.  I just...  And then what?  How do you figure out how many points you're allowed?  Oh, Jimmy, you have to go to the meetings.  You need, you know, the support.  No, I don't.  Oh.  I have enough support in this room, obviously.  No, that doesn't work.  You can't do it. 
[00:55:00]  No, that's fine.  I'm...  I didn't weigh myself yesterday.  I'm going with 170.  I think I'm 170, which is way too heavy for me.  I want to get down to 150.  Amanda's yelling at me, Opie, chill with the negativity.  Be supportive for little Jimmy.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking ahead where maybe Jimmy wants to go out on a date, maybe get a little action,  and he's got to pull out his Weight Watchers.  No, no, you get extra points, though.  You get, like, for the week, you can have a little bit of...  But can you figure all that out before you go to the restaurant so you don't have to pull  it out in front of the girl?  Oh, no, it's cool right now.  I'll be like, hold on one second. 
[00:55:30]  Fah, fah.  You want me to lick your vagina?  That's one point.  Now, where's the slider?  Is that the little thing on your phone that you...  No, if you had gone to a meeting, they would have given you a slider, and then on the  back of it, you would see your activity points, and you would know how many  points...  What year is this?  It's got to be an app.  Sweetheart, I'm looking at it on my phone.  Today, hold on, today's Wednesday?  Hold on.  I got daily use zero, daily remaining 33, weekly remaining 49, activity are three. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah, that's true.  You can do it on the computer now.  Exactly.  Take your slider and stick it up your ass.  Really?  No disrespect.  Not taken.  Ezra from New York writes, are you faggots going to talk about menopause next?  Hey, there's nothing wrong with a man wanting to get rid of his side fat so I can go out  and...  You guys, I can't even tell you how much better this is than brackets.  I'm so excited.  Brackets, brackets, brackets, brackets, brackets.  But my manager lost some weight, and it's like, I know it does work if you do it right. 
[00:56:30]  How many points will they allow for duty?  I don't...  It depends on what the other person ate.  You have to look at their slider.  Their points.  Well, you know, that's actually part of it, because the more fiber you eat, the fewer  points the food is, because you're pooping more.  Really?  Yeah.  So we all need...  Factor that in.  We all need fiber in our diets.  So I get 49...  That's very important.  Megan, I get 49 extra points for the week?  Wow, okay.  It says weekly remaining.  What does that mean? 
[00:57:00]  Cheat points?  You can add them on any day.  So you could have, like, an extra seven a day, or you could just go crazy one night  and eat all 49 points.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to do that, though.  What about when you want to treat yourself after a good Leno appearance?  That's what I want to...  I'll let you know when I have one.  You're going to be in trouble.  You're going to be in trouble.  No, you get points for that.  You get points.  You can go out and say, like, I had some sushi.  Sushi.  Maybe I ate some curt cake and sushi.  You could eat 24 and a half ice cream bars. 
[00:57:30]  Really?  So if you want to do it like that, you can, but you don't feel deprived.  I can already tell I'm not going to feel deprived because...  I feel depraved.  Deprived.  Well, so you're full?  I'm not eating that much different than I ate, but just better portions, and I'm being  aware of it.  Like, I have my egg whites, my three egg whites.  All right.  How much points is that?  You know, my whole breakfast was, like, five points total, and that includes cottage cheese  and a banana.  Oh, look at you. 
[00:58:00]  That's nothing.  And a banana, Sam.  Cottage cheese and a banana.  Good substitute, Tilly.  It's the real thing.  Wait a minute.  I'm not quite sure.  My egg whites were one point, and my cottage cheese, low-fat 1% was four points.  And surprisingly, my banana was no points.  Watch.  No points for a banana?  And for midday, my rolled gold classic-style pretzel fins were three points. 
[00:58:30]  My Coca-Cola caffeine-free diet soda was zero points.  My Weight Watchers giant chocolate treat bar, like we talked about, was four points.  The six large olives I enjoyed were one point.  The snow peas I enjoyed were zero points.  Every little fucking thing.  Oh, this is a lot of fun.  Six olives.  You've got to assign points to six fucking olives.  Well, no, I put in olives, and I just looked on the list, and it said six giants, so I took  that out of the list of hundreds of olive choices.  And now the barbecue chicken with pineapple. 
[00:59:00]  Fuck this.  How was that?  I didn't have barbecue chicken with pineapple.  I only had barbecue chicken, but it's five points.  And then for the evening, I had some olives, and I had some more snow peas.  So far, one point in the evening.  Snow peas and olives.  It's very good.  And you're saying you're not depriving yourself?  And a barbecue chicken with pineapple.  You're not going to keep up with this.  I enjoyed all my food yesterday.  It's too much, though.  It's too much to keep track of all of it.  And my activities were health club exercises in general, 40 minutes of health club exercising.  You should just get a trainer.  They'll beat the shit out of you. 
[00:59:30]  You burn way more calories than working out by yourself.  And then you can pretty much eat whatever you want.  No.  God.  Yes.  What about coffee?  You drink a lot of coffee.  That's not calories.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  I looked on there, but I said, you know what the heck with it?  I have like a coffee with skimmer of fat-free milk.  By the way, for the people asking, yes, we went from hockey to Weight Watchers.  That's right.  Why not?  You think those guys don't want to be skinny zipping around town?  Vroom.  Yes, we did.  Around town.  And this woman is giving Jimmy wrong info.  So, Megan, you're going to have to have it out with Casey. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Yo.  Oh, shit.  It's always a problem.  Yo, Casey.  What's up?  Hi.  I just saw a Weight Watchers two weeks ago, and the paper slider she's talking about is  like two years old.  All right.  I don't do that paper slider anymore.  Megan, what's wrong with you?  I don't have a paper slider.  I think you're doing the wrong program.  No.  You don't give a...  No, I mean, I still do Weight Watchers, but it's a different program.  It's 2012.  Meow.  Cat fight.  Ooh, Weight Watchers.  This is shit.  I just want to talk to Jimmy about Weight Watchers. 
[01:00:30]  God.  Meow.  I know.  Stop.  Meow.  Yo, Megan and I are trying to connect and stuff.  No, that was just a shit on Weight Watchers, and if she's giving him long information...  Well, she's not, but I have the app, and I have it now in my favorites.  It's in my bookmark bar in my own computer.  You've got to go to a meeting and hang out with these hens.  I don't want to.  What am I going to do?  You have to.  Applaud because someone lost 31 ounces?  What the fuck do I care?  Just think of the stories for the show. 
[01:01:00]  Go to one of these meetings.  No, I can't get...  Fuck it.  I'll join just to go to one of these meetings.  I can openly laugh at these assholes.  I got a full rod right now, and I don't know why.  Oh.  Jesus.  I swear to God, because Sam's computer is open.  Jimmy, you don't want to be her buddy.  You want to be my buddy.  I want to be what?  Well, Megan, we've got to look at a picture of you first.  We decide Jim Norton's buddy.  Yes.  We decide it.  I think you're going to like the picture, Jimmy.  Well, send it to the real Jim Norton at Gmail.  Now, this is...  I have a full rod, and Sam's computer is open to the Weight Watchers ice cream treats. 
[01:01:30]  Ah, that doesn't look good.  Because it looks like two big black cocks.  No, that's not why she...  Oh, see, that's what I thought.  Yes.  And then Dr. Gay started looking way closer.  Dr. Gay!  Eat ice cream off my special spoon.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Chris.  Yeah.  Chris.  I fucking joined last night.  I'm a big fucking boy, and I...  It is the biggest hole collection you could ever fucking imagine.  27 bitches whining about getting in the summer wedding dresses. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  How long was the meeting?  You actually went to a meeting?  I went to a meeting.  You went to the meetings.  Dude, my problem is I can't get myself to other 12-step meetings that I need to go to.  Just fucking dropping 10 pounds is not my priority, and I've been very negligent in my meetings.  But was there any pretty girls there?  Absolutely not.  No.  I mean...  You start getting the room saying, all right, which one would I fuck? 
[01:02:30]  I mean, you're picking through fours and fives, hoping to find a seven.  But you're...  But, you know, in New York, where do you live?  I live in Jersey.  All right.  I, um...  A four or five is like a, you know, an eight or a nine in, like, you know, Alabama.  I'd like to go in there and be really obnoxious and say, you know, I know so many of you are surprised that a celebrity has come to lose weight with all of you, but I think that we can help each other.  Just despite my celebrity status. 
[01:03:00]  Megan is gone.  I don't know why.  Maybe her phone.  I didn't hang up on her.  And Chuck is going to...  Chuck is going to warn me and Anthony of something.  She ate her phone with only one point.  Phones are one point without the case.  Chucky.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I wanted to tell Jimmy and y'all, too, I used to live with this girl, and she went on that Whitewatcher, and she got the worst gassers.  I really broke up with her because I couldn't stand any gassers. 
[01:03:30]  Jimmy's gas is horrendous already, and now we have to deal with Weightwatcher's gas?  No, it's not going to be any different.  Fuck.  It's been awful.  All them vegetables and all that stuff is awful, man.  No, what she was eating was just weird.  It's not what we watch.  Kevin from Connecticut says, hey, Jimmy, how about you actually walk up 12 steps?  Oh, man.  That's clever, but not very nice.  I did 40 minutes on the elliptical, but not the one with the arm.  Back and forth elliptical, which I use a lot.  I do this one, which is stationary arms. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  And I bring lightweights onto it with me, and I'll do a little bit over the head.  One, and two, and three, and four, and one, and two, and three, and four, and two, and one, and four.  And then I'll do that, and I do the little arm curls, and then I'll get off, and I'll put them down, and I get back on for a few minutes, and I'll go backwards, and I'll do sideward ab crunches with two 15-pound weights.  So I'll do 30-pound weights, and a little ab crunches.  That's nice.  And two, and three, and four, and one, and go, and go, and two, and one, and four. 
[01:04:30]  I just say numbers at random.  And seven, and 19, 27, and two, go.  Can you just eat 30 pieces of cake?  Yeah, you can do that.  You can.  You'll feel like shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's the Sam Roberts diet right there.  You've got to get some protein in there.  If you're doing that, you're not going to be healthy.  You've got to be smart about it.  Don't be a dick.  I mean, you've beaten the system, but Sam, you're only beating yourself.  You're right, Jim.  That's right.  You're right.  I had two yesterday. 
[01:05:00]  Probably more than I should have.  Oh, you.  I treated myself.  I guess Patton Oswalt has a bit on Weight Watchers.  That's terrific.  Maybe we play that to break.  No, does it?  I don't know.  But has he gone on or no under?  Probably.  Probably.  What's wrong with the man carrying a little extra weight?  Oh, shit.  Snow rain's on the phone.  What?  Snow motherfucking rain.  Snow rain with an F, baby.  What?  Snow rain?  What?  Snow rain, like a flower.  Oh, snow rain. 
[01:05:30]  Snow rain.  Snow rain.  If you've taken snow rain and have gotten headaches, bleeding.  There's a couple things going on.  Our screener sucks because it says snow rain.  But it's flo-  Flo-reen.  Flo-reen.  Flo-reen.  That's right, Paul.  If your drain is clogged, use Flo-reen.  What's up?  Flo-reen.  All right, Flo-reen.  What's up, babe?  I'm looking for employment opportunities.  Yeah.  Yeah, see if y'all want me up in this show.  Like, Howard hired a woman of color. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  You know, now that y'all's missing Patrice, I figured I'd get my ass up in there.  Up in there.  I like this stuff.  Yeah.  I would almost like to hire you just to spite Patrice.  Yes.  To know that he has to hopefully hear that this is the woman we've chosen to replace.  Yes, to replace him.  That's right.  That's right.  What do you do, Flo-reen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sell yourself to us.  What are you about?  What do you look like?  What do you do?  Where do you live?  Oh, baby, please, you can't judge me by the color of my skin. 
[01:06:30]  Ah, the content of your booty.  Hey, we don't do the hire, and we could absolutely do that.  Yeah, yo's.  I cook for you.  Yeah.  I come up in there with-  Pancakes with a bandana on your head.  What?  Whatever you need.  Yeah.  I clean Anthony's house.  I vacuum the carpet.  Whatever.  Oh, man.  Where are you from, Flo-reen?  I'm up in here in Connecticut.  Yeah?  What part of Connecticut?  Hartford.  No, not Hartford.  Up Bridgeport. 
[01:07:00]  I'm down by the water, baby.  I'm down by the water.  Bridgeport.  Stanford.  Stanford.  Stanford.  Stanford.  Stanford.  Yeah.  No, I mean, y'all probably want a nigga from Bridgeport, but that's-  Well, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  I like this, Flo-reen.  What's-  That's right.  Y'all need a little chocolate on the shelf.  What was your last job?  Huh?  What was your last job?  Oh, baby, I did everything. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  I am talented.  Let me tell you about my talent.  All right.  I do everything.  Y'all need a computer fix?  I fix it.  Y'all need them fried chicken?  I fry it.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Hey, guys.  What happened?  Y'all need y'all have a bottle of Ripple?  I drink it.  Ah.  That's right.  You whack.  Y'all, you know what?  If y'all have them nasty-ass, stanky crackers up there crapping on the table, I clean their booty. 
[01:08:00]  I love her.  You're hired.  Yeah, that's nice.  Flo-reen, how are you a fan of our show?  This doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  She wants to wipe shit out of someone's ass.  It makes perfect sense.  Y'all, I was over this cracker's house, Richard.  And he done had this show on.  I said, listen to them stupid crackers.  The stupid crackers show.  We would sit around.  We were drinking some, you know, cold 45-mile liquor.  Of course, yo. 
[01:08:30]  And I said, listen to this.  And then y'all had Patrice up in there.  And I said, mm, can't be that bad.  They got a brother on the show.  Yeah, look what that got him.  I would swear this is a character, but I think she's the real deal.  Yeah, she's the real deal.  Flo-reen's the real deal.  Oh, I'm the real deal.  That's right.  Flo-reen.  Oh, yeah.  Seth in Illinois wants to congratulate you on your supporting actress win there.  You got an Oscar, I hear.  That's right.  And I'm a talented actress, too. 
[01:09:00]  Y'all put me up in front of the camera.  What do you look like?  I am gorgeous.  Yeah?  Describe yourself.  Now, you got to see me.  Oh, come on.  No, how...  I can't be...  No, listen, listen.  Listen.  How dark are you?  You cannot paint a picture using words.  I don't care.  Yeah?  How clever or cunningly with you is.  Well, how much you weigh?  How tall are you?  How big are your boobs?  How dark are you? 
[01:09:30]  You just got to experience this.  Oh, yeah?  You know you want it.  You know you want it.  Do you have a Facebook page?  No, I don't do that.  But if you want me to build you one, I'll do it.  But I'm...  She can do anything.  That's great.  I can do anything.  Oh, man.  Man.  If you're willing to go through a lot of metal detectors, we'd have you up here.  Oh, I'm going to have to take off my jewelry?  Your jewelry.  What kind of jewelry you got? 
[01:10:00]  My jewelry.  My jewelry.  I like saying jury.  My rings.  Give me the jury.  Break yourself.  Take off my bling, baby.  My bling.  You know what I'm talking about.  You best take off that jury.  You like Obama?  You don't buy your girlfriend because you're so cheap.  Aw, shit.  We're not cheap.  You like Obama, Florine?  Who's Obama?  Is he hiring?  That's the president.  Come on.  Did you vote for Obama?  No, I didn't vote. 
[01:10:30]  No?  I figured they all assholes, so I'm not going to vote for Obama.  I'm with Florine.  There you go.  That's where I'm at, Florine.  She's talking the truth.  You know, I'm going to put some asshole up in the office and then complain about it because  it's my fault.  That's nice language.  I didn't vote.  I don't stay home.  I stay home with my friend Jermaine.  What does Jermaine do?  He sells the crack.  He smokes.  He smokes some weed?  Yeah, just a little bit.  Just a little bit. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I can't go crazy with that stuff.  I can't go crazy.  Nah-huh.  Well, I think we should get Florine on the show.  Where do you live, Florine?  I think you should.  I think you need a woman of color up in there.  You can't judge me by my skin, though.  Where do you live?  Why?  I told you I live in Stanford.  Oh, sorry.  Stanford.  Oh, that's right.  You said brickwork.  Stanford.  Stanford.  Say it.  Stanford.  Stanford, son.  Yeah.  What are you, Red Fox and stuff that all over town like a bunch of foxes? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  He is my man.  I love Red Fox.  Love that nigga.  Yeah.  You're a funny motherfucker.  You haven't really sold yourself.  We don't know shit about you.  Yeah.  Come on.  How old a gal are you?  Oh.  How old do you think I am?  Forty-six.  Forty-five.  Yeah.  That's a good guess because you write things.  Oh, yeah?  How many kids you got and how many different fathers? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  On both counts.  How many kids and how many different fathers?  I don't.  Well, I have two that I know about.  Well, you would know.  Two kids from one father?  No.  Two fathers, two kids?  No, they ain't my kids.  They ain't my kids.  They ain't your kids?  You didn't have your own kids?  They ain't my kids.  No, my sister don't pass away.  She left the kids with me.  Why did she pass away? 
[01:12:30]  What happened?  What happened?  Well, what you think happened?  Drug overdose.  Yeah.  Did she get the ninja?  What's that?  Oh, HIV or was it just like an overdose?  No, no.  She done the overdose.  Oh, okay.  On what?  What was her poison?  Horan?  Oh, the heroin.  Heroin.  Heroin.  So you had it taken...  No, not the heron.  That's a...  Isn't that a fish?  That's a fish.  A heron is a bird.  A herring is a fish.  So why didn't you have your own kids? 
[01:13:00]  Okay, I guess I didn't want any.  Yeah.  Are you, uh, you know, are you one of those gals?  What are you talking about now?  Now you got what...  Are you barren?  Does your wound work?  No, I was thinking more like a lesbian.  Yeah.  No, it worked, baby.  I ain't dead.  But Florine's a lesbian.  Florine.  Florine.  Are you a lesbian?  No, I ain't no lesbian. 
[01:13:30]  When was the last time you got a little dick?  Um, you mean a big one.  Or a big one, right.  A big one, yeah.  When was the last time?  Huh?  I don't know.  I can't count right now.  It's been a while.  Why is it important for you to know?  Right now.  We're just trying to get to know you.  We're learning nothing about you.  I want to know how sexually active you are.  I want to know what you look like.  I want to know your weight.  I want to know what you do for a living.  You're not answering us.  Then you ask me out on a date.  I'm not going to ask you on a date. 
[01:14:00]  Because we don't know what you look like.  Wait, why?  Why that kind of...  I would guess you're a big woman.  A big woman.  You sound big.  You sound a little big.  Why?  You don't like...  What's wrong with a big woman?  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  We're just stating the facts here.  It sounds like you're a big woman.  Yeah, ain't no wrong with that.  Nope, not at all.  That's right.  It's perfectly all right.  How big are you?  I'm the right size.  I'm just the right size. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, boy.  She doesn't give up nothing.  That means over 200 pounds.  You better start answering these questions or we got to go.  She must do great in the interrogation room.  She just doesn't answer anything.  Right.  Look, we're just trying to help you.  What was there?  Maybe an accident?  Somebody, you know, said something.  It happens.  We understand.  But we're trying to help you here.  Yeah, she's on a show called Size 48.  Florine.  Yo, Florine.  You want...  I'll send you a picture.  I'll send you a picture. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah?  How?  You got to mail it?  I guess so.  Don't worry.  I'll just go to the precinct and punch one up.  I don't have to do anything.  I would say send me one, but I've gotten 30 Meg pictures already.  Of course you have.  The first one I opened, it was like, I'm the one in the pink.  And she was the one who was 500 instead of 800 pounds.  I'm the fuck.  Very good.  They killed me.  The one was not Megan, and it was like a guy with a beard and a dress.  Oh, man.  I'm going to send you a picture.  Y'all freak out.  Well, how are you going to send it? 
[01:15:30]  You give me your email.  Oh, shit.  The real Jim Norton at gmail.com.  One word.  You know what kind of pictures you're going to get now.  I think we'll put you on hold to get like a secret email so we get to see what Florine  looks like.  You look like Ms. Butterworth?  No, baby.  I don't look like Ms. Butterworth.  I don't look like Aunt Jemima.  No?  Uncle Ben?  I'll tell you what I look like.  I look like your mama.  Oh, God.  That's Aunt's worst nightmare.  Well, that means we know that you like black penis. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Hey, do black guys have big dongers?  Actually, I don't.  I've never been with a black man.  Why?  I just don't like them.  Everything tastes better on a cracker.  Wow.  You have sex with white guys.  Yeah, that's right.  That's it.  That means you're probably not that dark.  I'm telling you, I'm going to surprise the shit out of y'all.  What kind of chocolate are you?  What, your work?  Are you a dark chocolate?  Are you?  I am the best piece of chocolate you said we're going to have. 
[01:16:30]  You got that Hershey color?  Yeah.  What are you?  Are you going to find out?  Are you mocha?  I'm going to have me up in there.  All right.  Why don't we get a, why don't we put her on hold and get her to send us a picture?  If we'd like the picture, we're going to call you back.  All right.  You're going to take my number?  Yes.  Off the air.  Off the air.  Off the air.  And you all give me a job, right?  Off the air.  You look like Florida Evans?  Yeah.  I come up in there and I clean.  I clean behind your nasty asses. 
[01:17:00]  When you clean her assholes.  I should be scrubbing the ass.  I don't know, baby.  Oh, your ass is dirty.  It's probably airy and shit and all kinds of who know what up in there.  Who know what up in there.  Yeah.  All right.  Get your ass clean, Florine.  Florine, hold on.  If?  Hold on, all right?  All right.  All right.  Someone pick up, Florine.  Don't go anywhere.  I want to see what Florine looks like.  If this picture is accurate. 
[01:17:30]  No way.  Pretty cute.  Let me see.  Megan, she sounds cute.  Let me see.  She's confident, too.  I bet you she is, too.  Oh, yeah.  He got you so bad.  Shoot me.  What was it a picture of?  What do you think?  Dick.  Yeah.  Dick.  Standing for this rod.  Hold on.  I will show you the real picture.  Travis saw it.  Oh, God.  She's very cute, but I'm hoping this is her. 
[01:18:00]  How do we know?  I know.  Do you have another picture you could send, Megan?  I'm not testing you.  You're just really cute.  I just wanted to hold on.  Now everybody's just going to send you a second picture.  No, but I have her email address.  Oh, yeah.  That's her.  Get out of here.  She's cute.  Yeah, that's her.  Literally, I start plowing.  I promise you.  Can I see two of you, please?  But she's white.  No, Megan.  Not this girl.  Oh.  No, this is the Megan thing.  The Weight Watchers girl.  Oh, the Weight Watchers girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's taking it.  She's doing that little view from above.  Nah, but she's not.  That's Megan?  Yeah, she's cute, man.  That's pretty good.  No. 
[01:18:30]  She's not.  That's pretty nice.  She's not.  You sure this is her?  Yeah.  Damn.  Wow.  You got a Weight Watchers, buddy.  Yeah, I do.  If that's her.  Could you send another picture, Megan?  I'm not being a creep.  It's kind of a glamour shot she's got going on there.  Yeah, hey.  A little glamour going on.  That's pretty good.  She's holding her titties and stuff.  Yeah, that's not.  But she's not.  It's from a.  Sorry.  It's from a bottom.  She's trying to keep her titties in control.  Yeah, yeah.  But you can see.  I like that.  Her body's kind of sexy.  Just trying to keep them all in. 
[01:19:00]  Graham.  What do they call that?  A hand bra?  Yeah, a hand bra.  She's got her arms crossed under her breast.  But watch that not be her.  Watch when she moves and she has little legs like the Indian boy.  Hair out of her chest.  Flo looks like the maid in Billy Madison.  Aw, she.  That's right.  Yeah, she just sounds like a big sassy.  Does she want a real job, you think?  She can call the show every once in a while.  I think we should get her in.  We gave her an email address, so hopefully we'll have a picture.  I sure hope so.  Maybe after the break.  Yep, we got her info and we gave her one. 
[01:19:30]  Sexy, is that Patton Oswalt thing playing the Weight Watchers thing?  I don't have access to the comedy stuff.  Oh, oh.  Let's say that again.  Oh, he's stepping it.  Oh, shit.  Can I say thank you to Roland, by the way?  For what?  Well, to all of us.  Did anyone want to go see David Lee Roth and Van Halen last night?  No.  We all had tickets.  David Lee Roth sent over tickets for us because he couldn't do these.  He's not doing any press.  And I was tired and I was like, I had to get up and I didn't go because I saw them recently. 
[01:20:00]  So I went on Twitter and a fan came.  I met him on my block and he took his dad and he said it was supposedly great.  They were good seats, too.  Wow.  I just couldn't waste comp tickets.  I didn't even hear that I had tickets.  I'm starting to think this Van Halen thing is good.  I'm starting to think they might have figured it out.  I kind of wanted to go, but I was just tired and I'm like, I hate to waste comp tickets.  It's like, it was just nice to miss.  Oh.  What's that?  Sorry.  I might have the Patton Oswalt thing. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  Hey, do you hear that fucking...  Go to PhillyFans715, E-Rock.  See if it's worth playing.  That weatherman.  On Twitter.  Thought he was being taped.  Yeah, it was live.  Danny pulled it out.  Oh, yeah.  That's fucking hilarious.  We'll play that after the break for everybody.  And Donald Trump is mad at Sacha Baron Cohen for upsetting Ryan Seacrest.  What?  Is Donald Trump for real?  No.  You don't think so?  It's always a good...  These pictures are not good.  They're not good?  The ones coming in?  They're not being helpful.  That's why we usually do this off-air. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  Yeah, that's not a good one.  A bunch of fat girl people.  I should know when I'm opening an email from...  And it says Raymond.  It's the name.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to try the Patton Oswalt to break?  What the fuck?  It was from a Conan appearance.  It's not loading up on this computer.  What's it?  That guy's Twitter account?  PhillyFans715.  I clicked a video before.  I got it on my dumb iPad. 
[01:21:30]  Phil's?  Or Phil's?  A lot of fluorines coming in.  A lot of fluorines?  As in P-H-I-L-L-Y.  Oh, you said Phil.  Philly.  Yeah, that.  Why don't we just play it?  Fuck it.  If it sucks, we'll just...  Is this like nine minutes?  We'll tap out.  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  Yeah, I was here before.  Huh?  It's not loading.  I found it before.  It's not loading on this computer.  Oh, that computer. 
[01:22:00]  You want me to play it off my iPad?  Yeah, that'll sound great.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why would that be a problem?  Because you might need it to cover your eyes sometimes.  Oh, that's crazy.  He's just going crazy.  Oh, here he goes.  Oh, he's armed you.  All right, then.  We just got to go to break.  I'm sure.  E-Rock, what do you got for break?  Anything good?  You just got to have something great.  Well, I had the Dick Vitale thing, but I closed out looking for Patton.  So give me one second if you want to know.  The who?  The who?  What is it?  Dick Vitale?  Oh, yeah.  You said Vitale, but... 
[01:22:30]  Oh, Vitale Vitale.  I think we wanted to play that in show.  All right.  Well, then, nothing.  We'll just go to Dick.  I knew those pictures would start showing up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's probably accurate.  The real one.  Oh, it's not good.  That's not good.  That's not her, sir.  I don't think that's her, but...  All right. 
[01:23:00]  We'll do this, and we'll return with something.  So, oh, my gosh.  Stay there.  Good morning, everyone.  The Opie and Tricel.  I'm getting sick and tired of everyone making fun of red-haired people.  One Serious XM.  He's a ginger.  You don't fuck a bitch who thinks she can be number one.  I cheat on my girl, it's with fat bitches that know what my girl look like and go...  Number two is good.  Even number three.  Three, three, three, three, three.  I've been saying, look, I'm a decent motherfucker.  It's because I want some side pussy.  It's because I want other pussy as opposed to yours. 
[01:23:30]  Doesn't make me evil.  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose timing ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  I said a pussy smell like mini burgers.  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  I got no self-esteem.  Your side pussy.  Mm, my God.  Damn, you got some nice teeth.  Ooh, so put it smelly.  I'm cool with number three.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy. 
[01:24:00]  Go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look.  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed.  And women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them.  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life.  Um, that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twats everywhere.  One side pussy. 
[01:24:30]  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women.  That's safe.  Miss Reese, I want to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole.  Side pussy.  Side pussy.  Side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Ooh, take it from me.  My ass is a guarantee.  Your side pussy.  You hear how delicious that sounded?  Ooh, I'll be your fucky. 
[01:25:00]  I'm not too hard to believe.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s.  They give you the uncut dope.  And then as soon as you go, they go, got you, punk motherfuckers.  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dudes want side pussy.  Ooh, we'll tell anyone that we get a fuck or twice a week. 
[01:25:30]  Your side pussy.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  But I'm more nasty.  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  Ooh, I want to fuck you bad patrice.  How you gonna say no to me?  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:26:00]  Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.  You gotta have something if you wanna be with me.  Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.  You gotta have something if you wanna be with me.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Thanks. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, boy.  We have to figure this out.  What the hell is this?  Let's see.  Good luck.  Oh, the challenge is on.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  Oh, no.  He's getting cocky with this bit.  Let's start with who sings this song.  You know?  Billy Preston.  That is correct.  Billy Preston.  Yeah.  Something from nothing.  The fifth Beatle.  This is when he was with the Otis Marshall band. 
[01:27:00]  Horrendous.  Something from nothing.  Something from nothing leaves nothing.  Whatever.  Let's see.  It's Black History Month.  The last day.  An extra day.  And you're commemorating it.  We could go with that.  That's probably not it, then.  Well, give us a hint.  The song is giving you the hint.  Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.  Let's see. 
[01:27:30]  This radio show.  The radio show.  Oh, Mel Carr was in selling half his stock in April?  No.  Good to know.  What, Sam?  I don't know why you bring that up.  Well, it's a big deal.  A lot of people are nervous and trying to figure out what that means.  Are you getting more pictures, Jimmy?  More pictures of fluorine?  It says here, let me cook you some damn banana pancakes, baby. 
[01:28:00]  And that's the picture.  That's from the original.  Don't worry.  Those chains of high-tensile steel.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, Lerock.  Could you just give away the answer so we can move on with the radio show?  There wasn't anything today.  Nothing from nothing leaves nothing. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, aren't you clever?  What do you mean there's nothing?  How much this day in history is there for a leap day?  That's a none-of-the-above thing.  That's a, you know, I hate the none-of-the-above answer.  There's all kinds of stuff.  Wait, but he does make a good point.  There is no history today.  Well, there is.  It doesn't really exist.  Leap years.  No, because whoever made the sheet, it says Lord of the Rings.  Won 11 Oscars eight years ago.  But that's not possible.  Eight years ago? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, wait.  Was eight years ago a leap day?  Every fourth year.  Yeah, two.  Oh, okay.  So that's...  And it's Ja Rule's birthday.  Ja Rule.  Ja Rule.  Ja Rule.  How old is Ja Rule?  Four?  He's 33.  He's in jail.  Why?  He's been in jail for a long time.  Divided by four, so he's, what, eight?  Oh, yeah.  He's eight.  Ja Rule's eight today.  And he could have just played, like, a leap, like, jump or something.  Yeah, man.  Because it would have been Leap.  Leap day.  Yeah.  Go ahead and jump.  Man.  Ah! 
[01:29:30]  Who said that?  Plus, you just talked about Van Halen before.  I heard it was a good show last night.  E-Rock, did you ever do the Weight Watchers?  I have the app, yes.  You have the app?  Yes.  Points like a basketball score.  How do you feel about diets in general?  Well, I should be proof that they really don't work.  Oh.  Well, yeah, but you break them.  Why don't they work in the end?  Well, exactly what you said.  When you do them, you lose the weight, but then it comes right back.  No. 
[01:30:00]  Because you haven't learned shit.  Like, last night, I was going to eat, right?  And I didn't want to, I was ordering, I had food home.  And I didn't want to have my second piece of chicken.  But I knew I had so many points left.  I'm like, eh, let me just eat it.  Like, because you know you got to enter it into the phone, and I didn't want to go over it.  So it actually does, it's a little extra thing in your mind.  But that, you're only one day into it.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about after you lose the weight, then we'll, we'll see.  And I hope, I hope it works for you.  And if it makes you happy.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  It'll, I'll lose the weight.  News Blue Parade, it's a weather guy fucking up. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This guy, he didn't know.  He didn't know he was, he was live.  He thought he was being taped for a segment to air later.  And, yeah, then the anchor woman comes back and, of course, doesn't acknowledge anything.  Who the hell's walking down the hall?  Oh.  Let me see.  Is that Flo Reed?  Is that Joe?  Mom.  That's Joe, one of our guys, one of our old guys, Joe. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah, with his woman.  Is that his woman?  That's his woman.  Joe, is that your woman?  That's his woman.  Are you sure?  No, just kidding.  Uh-huh.  That's his woman.  No, that's Nortia.  Who's that?  She's not behaving, I guess.  That's my, she's a security guard.  She's my friend.  She doesn't like you, Sam.  Yes, she does.  I flirt with her every day.  She's kind of cute.  For one of those people. 
[01:31:30]  What's that mean?  Oh, security.  What, is she working on weekends?  No, she's here every day.  Yo, Joe, what's up?  I just want to say hi.  I was wondering if that was your woman, but then Sam tells me she's a security guard here.  What, she works weekends?  She's here every day.  I just told you that.  I've never seen her before.  She's here every day.  She's number one.  Huh?  Security supervisor.  She's the boss.  Oh, she's like one of the fucking bigwigs?  She's awesome.  Is she Bruce's boss?  No.  He's her boss.  He's the head of all security.  Sam, I swear I've never seen her before. 
[01:32:00]  Well, you don't stay here past 10 o'clock.  Well, why would I?  It's a good question, too.  You're right.  Good morning, let's talk sports.  It's been nearly a year since Stan Swank's Ed Murdoch women's basketball team tasted defeat  in a game that counted.  That was back on March 11th of 2011 at the Atlantic Legion.  Tonight, son of a bitch.  One more time.  Start it over.  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready? 
[01:32:30]  Checking with sports in just a little bit.  Still ahead of reasons.  Oh, my God.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  This is why the news people should be executed.  Your job is to report the news and what's going on, and you can't be honest enough to  report an embarrassing flub that just happened on your show.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is news.  Like, what?  What?  Phonies. 
[01:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  God almighty.  They really are.  The guy's like, son of a bitch, why can't they go, uh, hey, by the way, that was live.  Yeah.  Jimmy, how many?  Good one.  How many points for a Starbucks oatmeal?  I'm not doing sugar, though.  Starbucks oatmeal.  Hold on.  With fruit, what you having on that motherfucker?  I did the nuts and the, uh, the, like, the cranberry, raisin.  The cranberry combo, whatever the fuck that is.  I have to search for foods now.  Mm-hmm.  So what's it called, Starbucks?  Hold on.  Oatmeal.  Oh.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  Tick, tick, tick, tick.  Ah.  Now, what's on it?  Nuts.  Hot breakfast.  Okay, I have to.  Nuts, toppings, and cranberries.  Looks like.  Cranberries and raisins.  Uh.  Here's a perfect, uh, a topping is a nut medley.  No.  I can't, I can't look at these in all because I have to go nut and cranberry, nut medley. 
[01:34:00]  No.  They have every option here.  Okay.  This is.  Oatmeal topping, dried fruit.  Three points.  Probably three or four points.  Is that a lot?  No.  They're all three points.  Unless you have the, uh, outrageous oatmeal cookie, that's ten points.  Oh.  That's quite a treat.  Yeah, but I mean, you know, if you want to split that down in the middle, you have five  twice.  That's your business.  Ten points for a cookie?  Yeah.  They don't play games.  They know how many points a cookie is.  Sure do.  You point a cookie, I'll have a cookie point.  Hey, we never did the Mike Vitti apology, and people were really mad after the show yesterday. 
[01:34:30]  Mike Vitti is the guy that does a jazz show in London, and, uh, unfortunately for him,  some gay porno was being played over his program.  Fortunately for us.  Ah, yes.  And, um, Mike Vitti, it was a pre-recorded show, so he had nothing to do with it, but,  like, listeners don't know that.  They just assume Mike Vitti really enjoys his gay porn, so he finally went on the air  after the controversy to explain himself out of the situation, and here is his apology. 
[01:35:00]  Jazz FM, and this is Funky Sensation.  Before we get on with the program tonight, I think there's a couple of things that we  need to say.  It's been an interesting week, to say the least, following the regrettable incident that  happened last Saturday night at around 7.15.  You know, radio's an interesting medium, and it's a bit like TV, and from time to time,  programs are recorded.  We're not recorded tonight, incidentally.  I'm here.  It's just gone two minutes past six.  But last week's show was on tape, and unfortunately, while the broadcast was happening, we had an  unauthorized access into the live feed at Jazz FM and the studios, which resulted in this 
[01:35:30]  highly regrettable incident happening.  Jazz FM really hopes that you can accept our profound and sincere apology for any offense  that may have been caused.  We'd also like you to know that we've put safeguards in place to protect you from hearing  this kind of content.  I hope it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this program.  We do spend a considerable amount of time crafting this show for you, and tonight is no exception.  We have a terrific program on the way.  In the next hour, we're going to go non-stop.  It is the last Saturday of the month, so tonight we're featuring an 18th and 19th... 
[01:36:00]  And that's why radio fucking stinks, and I'll never miss it.  Because twice he had to say a regrettable incident, like the sanitized...  Like, you've got to say we didn't mean to do it, we're sorry.  Yeah.  But he didn't even say what it was.  No.  Well, he'd rather people forget.  I know.  The sooner the better.  That gay porn was playing over his sacred radio program.  We've had unauthorized accents, which happened the regrettable incident.  It's just this plastic, detached, sanitized talking. 
[01:36:30]  It's like they're all phony.  The news is the same way.  It's terrible.  I would usually agree with you, but when it comes to gay porn being played over your program,  he probably wants to leave out some of the details at this point.  He should have said someone had unauthorized accents.  They played...  The pornography was playing over them.  I mean, I would never...  It's just these fucking faggot station managers who are afraid.  Well, it's also a jazz station, which is very different, too.  They're very fucking chill.  Why not tell the truth about it?  You don't have to make fun of it, or you can just go, eh, you know... 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Add in something that...  Like, that apology could have covered anything.  That's true, too.  Yeah.  It's a sanitized, neutral way of talking, and I'm tired of it.  It comes with removing words.  It's almost like they're just taking away everything peripheral, language-wise, and  they're just narrowing it down.  It was a regrettable incident.  Like, what robotic, non-human talk that is.  Yeah.  Who says that?  There's nothing personal about it, nothing that addressed what happened. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  It's legal talk.  Written by the...  Legal department.  The legal department.  The same in England as it is here, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, obviously.  Look at that.  We got our latest Asian story.  Is this the one that's...  The Round Eye Noodle Bar?  Yeah.  In Philly?  I was tweeting about this last night.  Yeah, yeah.  Got me so fucking aggravated.  Why are you aggravated?  Well, the short of the story, a couple of guys in Philly open up a noodle place. 
[01:38:00]  They call it Round Eye Noodle Bar because they're two white guys.  Aren't we called Round Eye?  Yes.  We are, right?  Yeah, that's...  So what's the problem?  Wouldn't that be an insult to the Round Eyes?  Yeah, it's like a derogatory term used by, I guess, Asians for Americans.  I don't know.  So what would be the problem there?  Exactly.  Who's pissed off?  The Asians?  Here's what I got.  Yeah, the Asians are pissed.  But they use Round Eye.  Yeah.  It's...  If you read the story, some woman says that if you go from Round Eye, it evokes a racial slur, 
[01:38:30]  slanty eye.  So it's a slur by association.  Oh.  It's now when a word brings up a slur.  Now that word can't even be used.  We're using it one detached from the slur.  Sure, one removed.  Now you can't even say that without people getting pissed.  It's beyond crazy.  So whose fault is that?  Now, is that the Asian fucking dummy who's complaining? 
[01:39:00]  Or is it these two guys that wanted some attention for their restaurant, got it, take the fucking  heat?  Yeah, then they just changed the name.  Yeah.  Oh, we're just going to change it.  Well, here it is.  After the name Round Eye Noodle Bar generated criticism from Asian Americans.  Criticism from Asian Americans?  Why?  You're the ones that use that term.  You're the motherfuckers that use it.  What are you talking about?  Round Eye.  Yeah.  Co-owner Sean Derog said the downtown Philly pop-up restaurant will get a new moniker.  He said he never meant to offend anyone, including the group Asian Americans United, which initially 
[01:39:30]  objected.  It obviously wasn't meant to be offensive.  It was kind of like a joke on ourselves.  Yeah, exactly.  But it brings up Slant Eye.  Right.  So basically because...  But I like that they say it was a joke on ourselves going back to Jim's point that  they should just go with it.  Fuck it.  Fuck these people.  Really?  Fuck that Asian group.  Let them not go to your Round Eye Noodle Bar.  Come on.  Oh, this made Fox News and everything, huh?  Our food is Asian cuisine, but we're kind of using French and American techniques, so 
[01:40:00]  we looked to come up with a name that had an Asian feel, but it was also American.  That's perfect.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have fucking folded.  It's not a slur.  It's kind of goofy.  How happy are you, by the way, that John Liu's on the paper all the time having problems  now?  Oh, John Liu.  That fucking cocksucker.  You fucking shyster.  Should have been cleaning up his own backyard.  Yeah, instead of accessing radio.  Instead of worrying about what fucking Elvis and JV are doing.  Right.  Right.  What about your campaign manager, scumbag?  This guy, JV, and this guy got JV and Elvis fired for doing an Asian accent. 
[01:40:30]  Fried lice.  Fried lice.  An Asian stereotypical accent on the radio.  Fried lice.  And it looks like he's got all sorts of shit going on in his life that he should worry  about before radio guys doing Asian shit.  Another campaign worker, fundraiser person being arrested.  It's all coming back to him.  Okay.  All right.  Samkawa.  Samkawa. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  Caught the attention of Ellen Samkawa.  I guess she's the spokesperson for this Asian American United group there.  Samkawa declined to discuss the matter when reached by foxnews.com, but she told philly.com  that the name round eye led to connotations of a very hurtful racist slur.  Oh, no.  It led to connotations.  Led to connotations.  Oh, no.  That's where we're at now, huh?  Don't say slant eye, but don't say anything that might lead to connotations.  Right.  You brought it on yourselves, you dumb motherfuckers. 
[01:41:30]  And I'm talking to Americans.  You brought it on yourselves, and you deserve it.  I'm disappointed in the Philly guys there.  They should have kept the name of their restaurant.  Yep.  Well, they were completely safe with their choice.  No one will defend them.  No one.  No.  They're out there alone.  Every time we watch this happen, we're all standing with our dicks swinging in the wind,  and now they're saying it's bringing up a connotation of a racist slur.  It's not even a slur.  Not even a slur, but if it's a connotation of a slur, it's white guys making fun of something 
[01:42:00]  making fun of themselves that Asians have said about white people.  Right.  But because by making fun of yourself through a racist Asian statement, you may bring up the Asians.  That's where we are.  Does this restaurant name give the power to the Asians?  Asians, if you think about it, they got the power of the upper hand on this one.  That's so stupid.  If you grew up Asian in America, there's no more common put down than ridicule of the  shape of our eyes, she told the website.  Be proud of your stupid eyes.  That's what I say. 
[01:42:30]  And it's not ridiculing.  What's wrong with having slanty eyes?  It's not ridiculing the shape of their eyes.  Be proud of your eyes.  Yeah.  What gives a fuck?  There's no way to hear the name round eye without at the same time hearing what is being  contrasted to a very hurtful racial slur slant.  Oh, so you don't say the opposite.  That's it.  Don't say the opposite.  You know what?  If I open a place, I can't call it white boys.  Right.  Because you know what?  Black people.  Black people may think that that has a connotation connected to nigger. 
[01:43:00]  And that would be a, you know what?  I can't do that.  Oh, boy.  So now the opposite words of slurs are now slurs.  Yes, because it brings up the connotation that will lead to a slur.  Are we really there?  I guess I can't open up a restaurant or a place that says consensual because, well, that  obviously makes you think of rape.  Coming to rapes.  What a dumb country.  What is the mainstream media doing with this story?  Are they all screaming?  They're doing nothing, right?  Are we the only ones once again? 
[01:43:30]  Showing the outrage here?  Because they don't get in trouble.  So they just keep pushing this because it doesn't affect the sanitized, shitty way they  do business.  Hell and Jim, a board member of the group, echoed some cowas' take on this.  In the owner's words, they are two white boys from the suburbs creating a hip noodle spot,  Jim wrote, according to philly.com.  But if these self-named white boys are the round-eye noodle makers, what does that make  the Asian noodle places their model in their place after? 
[01:44:00]  Who knows?  Oh, slant-eye.  Who cares?  Because if they're round-eye, it makes all the other Asian places slant-eye.  I see.  Oh, now I...  This is a major fucking reach.  Yeah, of course it is.  It really is.  Perfect story for leap day.  As a city notoriously home to Chink's Steaks, is that a real fucking name down there?  Yeah, it was the guy's nickname.  Guy had a nickname and opened up like a cheesesteak place.  Called Chink's? 
[01:44:30]  Called Chink's.  Because his name has been, hey, Chink, how you doing?  Whatever.  I don't know how he got the nickname.  Is he part-agent or something?  I don't know who the guy is.  Did he close it?  Well, it is, but he won't change the name.  Good.  He says, fuck you.  He's got to be a hardcore Philly guy.  Yeah.  Is that Chink?  Mm-hmm.  Look at the...  As a city notoriously home to Chink's Steaks, it's really a shame that a well-regarded spot  like...  Madeyson's?  I don't know.  Would lower their reputation to a legacy of petty derogatory names in an effort to be hip. 
[01:45:00]  Derogatory names.  Well, no, no, but you don't want it to make you think.  So now, once again, the thought policing has taken one step further.  If you do something that makes you think of something else, that's bad.  That's why they use N-word on the news, but it's getting to the point where if you use  N-word in a derogatory way, now that's even bad.  And that was supposed to be, well, now at least we can tell people in a way that isn't 
[01:45:30]  offensive what it means, but now it's become, you can't go like, hey, you fucking N.  Right.  You know, because then you'll know exactly what it means and you'll get in trouble for  it.  Can I tell you that I do love this show and I love doing stand-up the way I do it because  it's so freeing to be able to make fun of this stuff and talk about this stuff.  It's fucking...  Of course.  I open my set talking about race and not using certain descriptions and police suspect  description.  And it's so nice to not worry about like, I know that that's the thing that we're pushing 
[01:46:00]  back against right now in the country.  I know that that's the fucking...  It would drive me nuts if I didn't have the voice here and how to just walk through life  seeing this shit going on.  In an office where it affects you, where you're sexually harassing a woman if you have a calendar  on your fucking desk.  Right.  We're encouraged to hear about a possible name change and look forward to supporting  them in the future, this Helen Jim read, her email read, excuse me.  Hey, how about this, Helen? 
[01:46:30]  If they change the name, you guarantee them X amount of your business.  How about that?  Yeah.  How about if you're, if, if, if, since their name evokes a negative stereotype, you want  to make that reach, how about they make this reach?  You're implying that if they change the name, you'll support the business.  So how, let's go to the other reach.  They change the name and you support the business by X amount of dollars.  Right.  You fucking phony.  How about you be proud of your slanty eyes?  Just be proud of it.  I could see if they called it slant eyes, then they'd be all right, but he's not. 
[01:47:00]  Well, yeah, but we're not even close to that.  One of the owners said he understood the group's concerns.  I feel bad for these guys.  I'm sure they were feeling the pressure and the heat.  We would have liked them to just hang in there, but I don't know.  We're not down there.  So we don't fully understand what they were going through.  The group's concerned with the name, adding that he planned to write an apology.  Of course.  Oh, the apology.  God damn it.  All we want to do is hear people say they're sorry.  Oh, the apology.  What a faggity country this is.  We totally are. 
[01:47:30]  We're both business people, and we obviously wouldn't put something out there that is offensive.  That's why we're so quick to change the name, he said.  Once their point of view is explained, I understood it.  If you approach it the way they're approaching it, I understand it, but there's different angles to everything.  That's too bad.  I understand he's a business guy, too.  I mean, like, I do get that.  You want to make the money.  It's like that's why they put a black guy and a white guy and an Asian guy in every commercial, because you want to market your product to every group.  Right.  And you want, you know, that makes sense.  Yeah.  I'm sure they're hoping for some Asians. 
[01:48:00]  Some Asian market.  They're hoping for some Asians.  But it's kind of a goofy thing.  Round-eye noodles.  To come into the place.  They walk in, there's just fucking round-eye guys.  Do you think educated Asians give a fuck that this place is called Round-Eye?  Would they go there?  I don't know.  I'm asking.  I don't know.  You know what?  Maybe if I had that business, I would change the name, because maybe they're like, it's not worth losing the money over.  Like, if the Asian groups are bothered, they can't shut us down.  But, you know what?  If they have a choice of 10 noodle places, why would they come to this one? 
[01:48:30]  They might just go to another one.  Well, financially, you can change the name just to, you know, keep your business going.  But as a moral thing or something like that, fuck you.  I think it's refreshing that they're making fun of themselves by calling themselves Round-Eye.  White people can't even make fun of themselves anymore.  No.  It's amazing.  I don't give a fuck if an Asian calls me Round-Eye.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Crackers, you know, called crackers.  I'm opening a restaurant called Ofez, where I serve all white cuisine.  You know, American food Ofez. 
[01:49:00]  You don't know Ofez.  No.  That was what black people referred to white people as, Ofez.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yes.  That's supposed to bother us?  I guess at one point it did.  Why doesn't this white shit bother us?  Because we're in a position of running the country.  Yeah.  Whenever, whenever, Jim, you know, I tell you one thing.  When I did this show on Raw Dog after Tracy Morgan's thing, I had Rick Crome and Jim David on. 
[01:49:30]  They're both comics who are out, gay comics, and funny guys.  And I was saying, why is it obsessive that gay people make fun of themselves?  And why is it what Tracy did so bad?  And they weren't crucifying Tracy.  But Jim David said something that was like, eh.  He goes, well, it's not a level playing field.  Like, we're already playing on a field that's not level.  So, we, I was asking, why is there a satisfaction in going after somebody?  And he was saying, because you're not playing on a level surface.  If you were, it might not be that way.  And I was like, that's a good point. 
[01:50:00]  That's a point.  Like, all right.  Like, if, you know, I guess I don't need to explain further.  You know, a non-level playing field.  But I think it's level.  I think it's level now.  They can't even get married.  Just fucking, well.  For gays.  For the gays, yeah.  That's a problem with the religious bullshit.  I don't think it's level.  I think it's gotten a lot better.  I don't know if it's level.  I think you're right.  I think it's gotten a lot better, though.  Let's learn more about Chink's.  Stephen Philly, what's up?  What's up with Chink's cheesesteak place? 
[01:50:30]  Well, the thing that gets me about the other story is if they were already changing the  name, why do they have to apologize, too?  Well, the apology is standard operating procedure.  No, everything starts with the apology.  And then after that, usually they want your job.  Or in this case, maybe they want this guy's business.  Whatever.  I won't go there now just because they changed the name.  The word will get out.  And they'll tell people, don't go to this establishment.  Yeah, but now they'll, now.  No matter what these guys do, by the way.  I bet if they change the name, the Asians will be, they'll go to it because they'll feel 
[01:51:00]  like they had some power and they got something done.  Yeah.  They might actually support it.  So, I don't know.  Know what we need to happen?  We need this Jeremy Lin to go away.  Because it's bringing up way too much Asian.  It's the Asian thing.  Way too much Asian shit is being brought up because of one lousy guy that's doing very  well for the Knicks.  Well, the thing about Chink's here is that...  Chink's Steakhouse.  Chink's Steakhouse.  A couple of years ago, there was a big movement to try to get him to change the name and he wouldn't  do it.  Excuse me.  And his argument was that he's always been known as Chink. 
[01:51:30]  And they said, well, how'd you get that name?  And they said, when he was a kid, his eyes were very squinty and people said he looked  like a chink.  Oh, so it is a racist name.  It's a racist name, but it's a name he's had for, I guess, 70 years.  But if his nickname...  You know what?  I'm glad he kept it.  He's got the balls to keep it.  Right.  But if, say, he had big lips and they called him Nigger Face.  I mean, look, but seriously, if that was his nickname, would that be an acceptable name?  What a great nickname for somebody. 
[01:52:00]  Do you know what I'm saying, though?  What a great name for...  Put that up on the marquee outside.  What a great name for Steakhouse.  Oh, my God.  The argument, like, his explanation...  Again, it's his business.  He's welcome to do what he wants.  And I think he has balls to keep it.  Yeah.  But I kind of get the annoyance with that, because it wasn't like Chinks, because he  broke something when he was a kid.  He chinked...  He would always...  They were actually calling him because he looked Asian.  Yeah, but that...  Yeah.  I get what you're saying, Jimmy, but that's a pretty brave move to call his place Chinks,  though.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a very brave move.  Very. 
[01:52:30]  Not only is he thriving, but they now run commercials for his place on the radio.  Oh, that's great.  Look at that.  Man, what are you going to do?  The Asians are taking over the whole fucking world right now.  That's crazy.  They're trying to get into our minds.  All right, fellas.  We'll never think like them.  I just don't like...  We're never going to be robots like them.  If it was Chinks or other derogatory terms, that's one thing.  But round eye, again, it's one of those things that's just crazy.  Guilt by association for a slur. 
[01:53:00]  It's not even the slur.  It's what the word makes you think of, and that's the slur.  What?  How do you fucking...  It's crazy.  How do you speak when people are having to apologize for the likes of that?  It's just nuts, dude.  What about Cracker Barrel?  Yeah.  See?  Should that name be changed?  What about a black store that sells barrels?  What does that imply that the black store would be called?  See?  I don't know.  See?  It would be a barrel. 
[01:53:30]  Barrel would be first.  Yes.  Ah, shit.  All right, we got to rant.  This guy wants to rant.  Uh-oh.  You're the guy with the girl's name, right?  Hello?  Yes.  Oh, no, it's a girl.  Hello.  Yeah, it's Danielle.  We have a Danielle that's a guy, and then he gets mad when we say, nice girl name.  But that's not you, so sorry. 
[01:54:00]  Go ahead, Danielle.  No, it's fucked up.  You guys are all fucked up.  Americans are getting fucked royally, and let me tell you why.  This country bends over backwards, bends over fucking backwards for everybody who isn't an American.  And everybody gets a hand out, and everybody's hands are in my pocket.  I don't work to feed my family.  I'm getting fucked because I'm feeding my family, and then two or three people, I don't even know.  Is this Farooza Balk from American History X?  Doesn't it sound like fucking Edward Norton's girlfriend in American History X's voice sounds like it? 
[01:54:30]  Continue.  I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're getting my money, and I'm fucking tired of it.  And if you want to call me a round-eye, then it's my prerogative to go in there and eat your goddamn noodles and give you my money when I want. 
[01:55:00]  Don't tell me I can't say fucking change, round-eye, blonde-haired bitch, hoe, nappy-hair, anything.  Well, you're allowed to say all that, but the problem is when you're on the radio or on TV or you own a business, it's way different, man.  Because the money is going to be affected.  Yeah, the pressure that these people are feeling by these special interest groups, and then the stupid companies don't even back their employees when they realize the companies know that sometimes it's just an innocent fucking mistake, but that's not good enough anymore. 
[01:55:30]  And these guys don't make their living talking like we do, so for them it's not as important.  It would almost be like they feel the same way we would feel about it if there was some kind of a pasta, if there was a starch found in a pasta so they weren't going to make it anymore.  These guys might be up in arms and go, oh, that's the starch that makes the pasta delicious.  Without that, the pasta fall apart.  But we would go, who gives a fuck?  Fuck the pasta.  Don't serve the starch.  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:56:00]  Next.  So maybe it all depends on what affects you.  I like her thought on having to take care of people you don't even know.  I mean, I have a solution.  We're forced to pay a lot of fucking taxes, and they're going to try to get more taxes from us.  I would love to be able to control where my taxes go, where they go, look, you have to pay this much in taxes.  Who do you want to give it to?  No, you have a guy that represents you.  How great would that be?  Someone represents you.  But I want to bring up people around me, but I can't because I'm paying way too many taxes for other people that I don't even know. 
[01:56:30]  So I like her point.  I think me and this girl could have a great conversation.  Imagine us just sitting in a room drinking a few beers and just talking about how horrible some people are.  Oh, God.  Some people are fucking ball.  I might even be on a rollercoaster last night, and I'm still real amped up.  But guess what?  I'm fucking right.  If I want to give a charitable donation, let it be on my time, my dime, my clothes, whether or when I say I want to give them stuff.  But don't just take it from me. 
[01:57:00]  Don't stymize my wallet.  Listen, if I want to be fucked up the ass, fine.  Do it.  I hear you.  I don't think you're crazy thinking, let me control where some of this money goes.  That you're taking away from me.  I like that.  Or at least maybe say, okay, out of all the taxes you're paying, you know, give me a percentage of the taxes where I can control where that fucking money goes.  Please.  It's my money.  I made it.  Absolutely.  And it's American.  It's totally an American thought.  This country was founded on, hey, man, we want to break free of certain things. 
[01:57:30]  And breaking free, there are no racial boundaries.  People who fight and stand up for other races and things like that, you know what?  How about we stand up?  You're in America.  And that means you can be who you are and be what you want.  Man, she goes off.  I love it.  You know, I got a really big family and I help them out when I can, but I can't help them as much as I would like.  And how great would it be if you're forced to fucking, you know, pay all this money, but you at least could, like, control where some of it goes even. 
[01:58:00]  Why can't I bring up the people that I want to?  Around me.  How about I start with bringing up the people around me and then I'll worry about others.  Right.  I like that.  Yeah, whatever.  That's never going to happen, so why the fuck would we even bring it up?  Yeah.  That's just stupid talk, right?  That's crazy talk.  That's just insane.  Now you're talking crazy-like.  But do you know the way people look at it, and there really are people that see it.  There's a guy that Twitters me, and I just posted a response to him some way for my Twitter update.  We were talking about the, what was it we talked about before this? 
[01:58:30]  Before the...  Round Eye.  Round Eye.  No, the jazz thing.  Oh, right, right.  Complaining about the noodles.  And he was saying something about, he Twitters me, he goes, you want, Jimmy, what did you  want the guy to do, say he's pissed that a moron had gay porn on in the background of  commercials?  And I Twitter back, nope.  And then the man later goes, it's a jazz program, meant for all ages. 
[01:59:00]  A parent doesn't want a program to bring up something that we have to explain.  In that statement...  Oh, boy, yeah.  ...is exactly what the problem is.  There was a way to do that, that it wasn't as sanitized.  I don't give a shit if you have to explain stuff to your kids.  Yeah.  They're your kids.  That's part of your job.  Enough with this lazy parenting.  Yeah.  How about you have the conversation?  Well, you know what?  What that was?  Was somebody was watching movies they shouldn't have been watching, and they were careless, 
[01:59:30]  and the sound went out, and it's very offensive.  Yeah.  Is that too hard as a parent?  That's impossible.  Could you talk to the guy in the room that has a kid?  I look forward to explaining a shitload of stuff to my kid.  I look forward to it.  I'm not going to take the lazy way out and go, oh, fuck, that shouldn't be on TV, or  that shouldn't be on the radio.  I'm going to explain everything.  I'm going to sit him down all the time.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  That's called parody.  That guy's pissed off because certain things that happen in this country and in the world 
[02:00:00]  put him in a position where he's got to explain it to his kid, and that's bad?  I don't want sanitized entertainment because I'm a father.  I absolutely don't want that.  It'll make my job a little tougher, and I'm going to have to explain shit, but I'll say  it again.  I look forward to that.  The world and the country here, not based on making sure the kids don't hear things.  That's a sucky place to fucking live.  I want entertainment that is adult-oriented. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  I want things that are edgy and funny in a twisted kind of way.  Why do we have to always tame things down because the children might hear it, or we'd have  to explain it to kids?  Fuck them.  I want to fucking live as an adult.  Do your job as parents and explain.  If the explanation was, look, some very inappropriate content played on this show.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  The guy didn't have to say it was gay porn.  He could have just said some. 
[02:01:00]  It was the way he said, which led to the regrettable incident.  He could have just said, look, some inappropriate content.  We know what happened.  You know the movies grandpa watches.  Just say that to the kid.  You know some of the movies grandpa watches?  Yes, when you're on his lap.  I agree, but I don't think he's that type of personality on the radio to begin with.  I think he's very just straightforward.  But that's just explaining what happened.  That's just an honest explanation.  I agree with you, but I don't think he's that type of guy.  Well, it's the whole.  There's always been that type of radio, no matter what kind of FCC regulations or what 
[02:01:30]  companies do.  There's always been that kind of shitty radio.  Oh, yeah.  But wouldn't he just say that some content played that wasn't like the thing is he certainly  could have ramped it up because you're listening to it and if you didn't hear it, you wouldn't  know what the fuck he was even talking about.  And that's what they wanted.  Sanitize.  Wipe it away.  Right.  That's what we like to do.  And a lot of racism in this country.  Take away the nigger.  The word nigger.  Everything's OK.  There we go.  It's fine now.  That doesn't exist.  Never happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me once said about America and then everybody goes, America likes to sweep shit under the carpet. 
[02:02:00]  And it is what we do.  We sweep shit under the carpet and we pretend that we didn't have it and we stand on it  and we scold you for doing what we just did.  It's the fucking phoniest culture we're turning into.  What happened?  Maybe we were always phony.  Maybe we always were.  We were always phony.  We just ramped it up.  Like in the 50s when we were talking about fighting for other people's freedom and then  blacks couldn't play bait.  You know, yeah, I guess we were always phony.  Always.  Who are you kidding?  I love the country, but it really annoys me. 
[02:02:30]  And 24-hour news cycles and the Twitter and the Facebook, it just seems to be ramped  up.  That's all.  Hey, Detroit Rob Rose, this has to be said in.  I apologize.  I'm going to take a shot at your lady there that just called in.  Oh, it seems like you might have been in love a little bit.  Well, no, I was a little smitten with that.  A little bit, right?  Detroit Rob writes, if this dumb bitch is hung over on Wednesday and not at a desk at  830 in the morning, how much is she giving in taxes?  She's an ignorant bigot.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:03:00]  She had a day off, maybe.  Whatever.  Ignorant bigot.  Why?  Because she's just talking about fucking paying taxes and paying for people she don't know.  Everyone.  Oh, people love throwing around bigot and racist and stuff.  Stop.  I got an explanation, by the way.  Oh.  A rational explanation of Twitter back from the guy she was talking about.  Yeah.  He said, yeah, but I want to explain at my time, not while I'm driving in the car.  That sucks.  I want to explain it when they aren't distracted.  I want to explain it at home, not in the car. 
[02:03:30]  So then you say, look, we'll discuss this when we get home.  Of course.  You can't control when this stuff is coming at your kid.  If they ask what happened, if they ask what happened, then I sit them at home.  Kids are distracted.  The car, we see the same thing.  But, like, you want us to sanitize everything beyond where it's already sanitized?  Because if you're a little tripper.  Because you're driving?  Yeah.  But the self-centeredness of that.  That's just stupid.  You don't know when your kid's going to be bombarded with this shit.  God almighty, do your job.  Like, I don't expect people to change their content because I'm in my car at all. 
[02:04:00]  I just don't expect you to do it.  Parenting has become extremely lazy.  And they expect everyone to do it for them.  Because everybody takes a village.  Maybe it's because of my hours, but I'm out there in the city with my kid all the time.  I do not see any other parent out there with their kid.  No?  No.  About nannies?  It's all Jamaican nannies in New York.  Jamaicans.  They're Jamaican, Dominican, a lot of black nannies in general. 
[02:04:30]  I do not see other parents with their kids.  And I do, I'm out there after 5 o'clock when obviously parents are home by then.  And I just don't see it.  They're like, ah, I'll just fucking hire a nanny and they'll do all the heavy lifting.  I just got to, you know, pick them up and go coochie coo.  Right.  And then, oh, something happened.  Give them back to the nanny.  That might be a New York thing because everyone that lives in New York, they're just completely  obsessed with making money.  That's all they give a fuck about.  You have to live here.  Yeah.  They don't give a fuck about anything else. 
[02:05:00]  Quality of life.  They don't give a fuck.  They just want a fat bank account.  So maybe that's just a New York thing.  But that's what I know.  So I might bring it up, I guess.  You see it on Long Island?  Yeah.  No, you see parents with their kids or is it a nanny thing out there?  You know what?  Long Island's weird these days.  You don't see kids, period.  No, I know.  Is that weird?  You just don't see them at all anymore.  They're not out riding bikes.  They're not out walking around.  They're not out playing.  I guess they're in their houses, safe and secure, behind their locked alarms doors.  Video games. 
[02:05:30]  Playing video games, yeah.  No, Ant, I was on Long Island Sunday.  I visit F.H. Riley's.  I visit my mom.  I visit my brother.  And I took the back roads.  You know where Old Fields is?  Yeah.  I'll go real local.  And then I'm taking the back roads to my brother's house.  So a lot of neighborhoods.  Yeah.  On a Sunday at noon or one in the afternoon.  Noon.  And I didn't see one fucking kid.  No.  I didn't see one fucking adult.  And it was a sunny day on Long Island Sunday.  And the temperature was nice. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Where the fuck are?  Where is everybody?  I don't know where they all went.  They're just gone.  When we were growing up, you hung out in your front yard, your backyard, your side road.  You hung out in the street.  You were a gang of kids on your bikes.  You would be biking from one house to another.  I was creeped out.  I'm so glad you just brought this up.  I was like, it's like a ghost town on Long Island.  No kids.  The parents don't trust the out of doors.  And they also don't want to go out, though.  They actually like hanging out and playing Call of Duty.  Yeah.  They just troll the internet, whatever.  Honestly, it's weird, though, man. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, these houses on Long Island, I'm talking, where they're pretty much on top of each other.  They have a little small yard each, but there's house after house after house.  I didn't see none.  No one.  Wow.  It creeped me out.  I think I'm finally a city guy because of, like, the slowness of driving around Long Island was kind of, I don't know.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was creepy.  I needed to see people.  I needed to see some action.  Let's go to Scott in Cleveland, where Jim Norton's going to be.  And hopefully our show, if the guys down the hall don't fuck up.  Oh, we'll see.  Don't fuck up the whole thing. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Scott in Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, Opie, I just want to let you know, when something comes on the radio and my kid's sitting and listening, if it's something where it's a blowjob or something, I just change the channel.  My kid's not even paying attention to that shit.  Exactly.  And for the most part, my 12-year-old with her smartphone, with her friends, is seeing so much more shit than she's being exposed at.  Yeah, tell her to delete the ones I've sent over.  They're terrible.  I don't need that. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, but you make a good point.  I think the adult realizes probably before the kid, because they're so distracted, if something crazy is happening on the radio.  So you do have the opportunity to change the channel if you want before the kid really absorbs what's happening.  Exactly.  But listen, I've got to go before I have to buy those tickets to Jimmy's show up here in Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  Shows are sold out.  They've both been sold out.  So now you're going to have to just go to our live broadcast.  I hope the word gets out.  I want a big crowd in Cleveland.  Me too, man.  I want a real big crowd for the radio show.  Hey, looking forward to it, Jimmy. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Scott.  See you in April.  Late April, I think, right?  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Oh, I fucking hate this fucking thing that Mark's about to talk.  About twice.  Whatever.  Go ahead, Mark.  How do you guys feel about the little PSA they run on NBC?  And they run it during shows that are marketed towards children talking about the fag word.  Now, that's aimed at kids. 
[02:08:30]  And why do I have to explain to a four-year-old what a fag is?  Because NBC sees it to show it during those times.  Saturday morning cartoon.  But why does it bother you?  You're going to have to explain that to your kid.  Once again, I can't wait to sit my kid down when he understands more stuff and explain this.  Where the word came from and why.  You don't want your children to have sex.  A fag is a queer.  Wait.  Are you saying why?  Maybe.  It's the NBA commercials, right?  The NBA is all over it.  Because they're making a moral. 
[02:09:00]  Maybe because they're making a moral.  Like, they're just introducing this moral discussion for no reason when it's not their business.  Right.  It's thought policing in a way.  I'm talking about where, like, they show the two kids sitting at the booth.  And the one guy goes, man, that sweater, you look like a fag.  And then the person, whatever stupid-ass actor or actress they have, goes on to explain that it's wrong to say that first.  Yeah.  I'm talking about a four-year-old.  You want them to be able to keep at least a little bit of their innocence as a child, unless you're Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  Boy, let me ask you a question, too, though.  We had those commercials in our lives growing up, too.  Remember the kid and his grandfather?  Who's Jimmy?  He's my Jewish friend.  Like, there were those anti-racism commercials when I was a kid.  So they've always been around.  Sure.  I didn't.  You know what?  I didn't even remember those.  No.  Yeah.  When the kids in his grandfather's experience, well, he's not your Jewish friend.  He's your.  Do you remember?  Can you Google that?  I'm sure we'll take an hour and a half to Google that.  But can we look it up?  Racism commercial, rowboat.  But I know what you're saying, but those commercials have always kind of been around. 
[02:10:00]  Isn't this great?  In those days.  Isn't this great?  Well, the fag one is.  It's very popular right now.  Yeah.  I'll hear you.  Is this it?  Go back.  Yeah.  Good job, Sam.  Sam.  Hold on.  It's me and my little friend.  And we want to play the current commercial, too, that this guy's talking about when you  find that.  Yeah.  This is the 770s.  Let's listen.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sam.  Prejudice.  Do you know what prejudice is? 
[02:10:30]  No.  Well, prejudice is when you react to someone because of their religion or their colors.  But I don't do that.  Who is Jimmy?  Jimmy's one of my Jewish friends.  And you are prejudice because you think of Jimmy as your Jewish friend and not your friend.  Oh, God.  You should call him your kike friend.  Exactly.  He's Jimmy the bank controller.  Your Jewish friend is too nice.  You have to say that he's your Christ-killing friend. 
[02:11:00]  You're never going to change how people think like that.  That's hilarious.  You might be able to educate a little bit, but you're not going to change.  You talk about people that are different than you.  Yeah.  That's the human experience.  Like it or not.  And you're not really going to change that ever.  No.  Who's Jimmy?  You're just going to come up with new words and new ways to do it.  Who's Jimmy?  He's the hebe that's been coming over.  Oh, I see.  Good boy.  He's the short hebe.  No, no.  He's not your short hebe friend. 
[02:11:30]  He's just your hebe friend.  Don't judge him because of his height.  Judge him because he killed our Lord and Savior.  Judge him because they chose Barabbas instead of our Lord and Savior.  Those heathens.  I mean, you know, try if you want, but it's not going to really fucking change much.  The fag one is the big one these days.  And we got a gay couple we're friends with.  What?  And one of them explained that he fucking... 
[02:12:00]  The show after us?  You're putting Ronnie in the hell.  Well, Ronnie's...  Deal with Ronnie, man.  Ronnie gets it.  And he explained why he fucking hates the word faggot, man.  He just fucking...  It just goes visceral with the guy.  And he has...  He had like a nephew or a niece that used the word not at him.  And it just drives him nuts.  Yeah.  That's...  It's a rough one for gay people.  Because I think that was always associated with violence.  Faggot.  Again.  Right.  It's like...  That's right before you get smashed in the face if you're a gay guy. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  But I try to...  You're usually going to hear that one.  I try to explain to him that when I was growing up, we used the word not even knowing what gay  was.  It was just something you used.  If your friends didn't want to go out, they were being faggots.  Or fags.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll be a fag.  But that's the meaning that a lot of people use.  And that's taken away too because...  But then gay guys will use the word with each other.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That always confuses me too.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  And black people just throwing the word nigger around.  Right.  And we...  You know.  Right.  But they're really offended when a white guy says it.  Oh, yeah.  But they're not offended when they say it to each other.  And it's a bullshit thing.  It's really confusing to me.  It has nothing to do with, well, when you say it, it was all this hate and everything.  It's a complete power play thing.  It's a power play.  They love having something that we can't have.  I just think it would be way more...  Even if it's a dumb word.  ...effective if they chose among themselves not to use the word then, if it's that... 
[02:13:30]  That ain't gonna fucking ever happen.  No, I know.  But I would understand that at least.  Like, okay, this word is so offensive to us that we've decided we're not using it with  each other.  It's not offensive to them.  It's not.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  But they just don't want us to use it because it's a power thing.  But there's gays that will say faggot, faggot, faggot left and right with each other as well.  And again, same situation.  So if the word is so offensive, I would feel like that group of people would get together  and go, look, if we're gonna get our word out, we gotta stop using it too.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that logically make sense at least? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it would.  But that's not...  It's not where we live.  Oh, this one's called That's So Gay?  Well, these are the ones we've played in the past, and one has Hilary Duff, one has Wanda.  Oh.  Do you have the one for fag?  I think there's one that says fag.  I don't see it.  That's So Gay.  Yeah, we used to say That's So Gay.  Yeah.  Oh, That's So Gay.  I didn't know what gay was.  What is it?  Oh, that's gay.  Your car is gay.  That bike is gay.  That was it.  It was just, it's gay.  Let's listen to this.  Yeah, Frank. 
[02:14:30]  Right?  That's so gay.  That's really gay.  Look at those pants.  Please don't say that.  What?  Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something is dumb or stupid.  It's insulting.  Say it's retarded.  Yeah.  It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid, and I said, man, this pepper shaker is  so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache.  Just saying.  Funny.  When you say That's So Gay, do you realize what you say?  Knock it off.  But the guy was supposed to be offended by that? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  How do you feel Wanda Sykes, who's a comedian, doing commercials like that, Jimmy?  I know she's in that world.  She's a funny comic.  Wanda's a good actor.  She's hilarious.  I love Wanda Sykes' comedy.  I don't mind somebody doing a PSA.  Again, it's a public service.  You're gay.  So you're doing stuff that way.  You're a PSA.  My problem isn't when people don't want you to say something.  Or it's when they want to penalize you for it.  If you're offended by the word chink or the word cut, fine.  And if you're like, look, I don't think you should say that word. 
[02:15:30]  It's when they want the penalty that bothers me.  It's not her doing that PSA because she's gay.  I get why that would annoy a gay person.  Hey, that's so gay.  All right.  You get sick of hearing that shit.  Like, hey, I'm gay.  I'm not fucked.  Right.  Okay, but if it's when they get into the penalty phase and they begin carting you out for the forced apology and they don't respect your freedom to say what they don't like and disagree with their opinion, that's what bothers me.  Not people wanting you to talk to them nicer.  I get that.  I mean, I'm not an idiot.  Well, she was eavesdropping in that commercial because the guys were just among themselves. 
[02:16:00]  Well, that was just the way the commercial was written for the point.  I mean, like there was no way to get into that seemingly casually and that they were trying to paint a real life situation and what gay people go through hearing a conversation like that.  Well, I'm confused.  When we were growing up, we never really â€“ we didn't say it in front of gay people.  It was just among ourselves.  We weren't trying to be hurtful of someone that was in earshot.  Well, they were there and you didn't know it.  That's probably what â€“ that's what she's â€“  That's probably â€“ that's what she's saying, right? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but if it's just your â€“ you know, Brewer says faggot all the time and I get it when he says it.  And growing up on Long Island, you just said that with your friends.  That's all he said, yeah.  But you were never thinking that you were saying it in a hurtful way to a human being.  Oh.  You were just fucking around with your friends.  Yeah, and I'll say faggot sometimes.  I don't say â€“ when I'm talking about gay people, I don't think like, hey, look at those faggot at all.  Oh, no.  And I don't refer to them like that.  No, I don't either.  Unless I'm really mad.  But no, of course. 
[02:17:00]  That's why I'm really confused by the whole thing.  Yeah.  It's when they want you to get in trouble that they lose me.  And I'm compassionate and I understand their point and I don't even disagree with a lot of times their point.  And I'm willing to fight for their point.  Yeah.  But when they want you to get in trouble, they just completely lose me.  And by the way, can I say this guy?  Either call the show or I'm going to block you on Twitter.  He just â€“ it's not all about you, Ray.  Like, I'm sorry you think I'm a lazy parent. 
[02:17:30]  I don't want to explain gay porn.  That's not what I'm â€“  No.  It's not all about you, Ray.  I use what you wrote to get to a bigger point about parents expecting the rest of us to do it.  And no one's telling them to explain gay porn to your kid.  I don't care what you explain to your kid.  You Twittered something I said.  You responded, what am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Explain it.  Sorry you don't want to explain why gay porn played on a thing.  Sorry.  But it's one of those little things in life that happens.  So as a parent, you have to jump in and cut these things off at the past and explain them to your kid. 
[02:18:00]  Doesn't he understand how that's going to affect him?  But doesn't he understand in the end that he's going to be hurt by that if he wants all that to go away?  Entertainment sucks in general.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my God.  It's just â€“ oh, my God.  Okay, okay.  Save it for the field.  It's time to rock.  Oh, okay.  Save it for the field.  We're about to rock again.  Thank God.  The field is time to rock.  Phones are lit. 
[02:18:30]  Let me see.  Had to explain sex to his kid because of a pop-up on computers.  All right.  And by the way â€“  What's the problem with that?  That or something some kid said, hey, Timmy said blowjob.  What is that?  That's what mommy never gives me.  That bitch.  This is good.  You know what?  Let's roll with this.  Let's start with Eric in Tampa.  Eric.  Hold on, Eric.  I'm still laughing.  That's a brilliant joke.  Eric.  Yeah.  Go. 
[02:19:00]  Hey.  Okay.  So, yeah, my kid, he got a pop-up on the screen and, you know, had a, you know, a little sexual thing.  And, you know, we talked about it because I saw it when I went in there to check on it.  And he asked me, he said, how come, Daddy, how come, you know, men like to put their penis on the lady's penis?  And I said, well, first of all, he was 10.  I said, first of all, son, it's called a vagina.  And second of all, because it feels really, really good.  When you get a little older, we're going to have a discussion about that.  But right now, I don't think you should be, you know, looking at that stuff.  So, we're going to, you know, fix your computer and get it for our way. 
[02:19:30]  And I answered if he had any other questions.  And he said no.  And then we went on about our business.  I had a really good discussion with my son about sex.  I tell him everything.  You know, the whole thing.  The clit, the everything, eating it, all that, I let you know.  Well, you know what?  Uncomfortable.  I use my words right.  I don't just tell him, but yeah.  You got to call it a cuda.  A cuda.  Or a do-nana.  Because my father didn't tell me anything.  Call it a sloppy place.  Or call it the, call it, you call it the candy hole. 
[02:20:00]  I haven't gotten into check news yet.  I just got into the, you know, you asked me a question about some stuff the kids are talking about.  I mean, in the class, you have a grade, so they think they're talking about sex, you know.  All right.  I don't know.  I know when I was growing up, my parents were scared shitless to talk about sex.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I didn't hear anything.  Was that a generational thing, you think?  Yeah, I didn't hear any sexual shit from my parents, thank God.  But we're in a new world that I think it's kind of important, right?  Learned it all from the streets. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I learned it from you.  Yeah.  If I heard something wacky like that, I wouldn't fucking, you know.  I remember, I've told this maybe years ago, who the fuck knows, but I was making like I was singing,  and I was standing on the living room table singing celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music,  but I was singing masturbate, masturbate, and I didn't know what it meant.  I just heard it somewhere.  And my father, very, very thoughtful and compassionate and informative, told me to knock it off and shut the fuck up and don't use that word. 
[02:21:00]  Really?  And it made me think, I ain't even going to fucking ask why or what the word means or anything.  It's not like, Dad, what does that word mean?  Because he should have walked in and been like, Anthony, that word you're using is inappropriate to just yell out in public like that.  Make sure, you know, in the house it's okay, but make sure you don't use it like that because it has another meaning that you probably don't know about. 
[02:21:30]  It's when somebody makes themselves feel good by touching themselves in a place, your private place.  They're cooking bulls.  Instead it was, shut the fuck up!  Don't say that shit!  All right, all right, I got you, Pop.  Fair enough.  And then I went to my friends and said, what the fuck does masturbate mean?  And they go, it's when you grab your dick and you yank on it. 
[02:22:00]  They go, oh, okay.  Shouldn't we learn that a lot sooner than we did?  Yeah.  We should be shown.  It would calm us all the fuck down.  Be shown by a close friend or uncle.  Yeah, by a relative.  Yeah, show him how to lick their palm.  Oh, it's Sax God that you're going back and forth with?  Yeah, it's amazing.  He's on the line.  Yeah, okay.  We've never had him on the show.  Oh.  He's very intense on his Twitter.  Endless.  Sax God is very, you're very intense with your Twitter, sir. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sorry.  Hey, I just wanted to apologize to Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't, I was just, yeah, I, you know, I wasn't trying to, you know.  Well, you did.  You upset him.  He's crying.  No, dude, I'm not saying he should apologize.  But I think you're way off on this one, sir.  Because, you know, you don't want them controlling our entertainment.  You just don't want that.  You're right, no, you're right, you're right.  I, my two boys, I, they have iPads, I let them watch Netflix, and I explain to them like, you know, or South Park, for example, or Family Guy, or American Dad. 
[02:23:00]  I, you know, explain to them, well, seriously, I explain to them that, you know, that's not for, you don't say that stuff.  You know, you just watch it, enjoy how it, they like the comedy of it.  And I don't, I don't tell them that they can't say that stuff, but the way the guy said it, it's a jazz program meant for all ages, and, you know, you don't expect, and one, didn't you guys say that that was only for one market?  I'm not sure, but what, no, it probably, I might have just went out on, but the problem is, it's the sanitized way we speak. 
[02:23:30]  It doesn't have to be over the top, hey, you know, we had played ass sex or hardcore gay porn.  But it's, it's, it's so far in the direction of being sanitized and neutral and having no value, like, what he's saying has no value to me at all, because he's not painting it like a human being.  If he said, look, some inappropriate content was played, that's what you have to say.  It's honest, people know what it was, because the news, again, 24-hour news cycle, we know what's happening.  But they're just sanitized with everything they do, so that's why, no, I mean that particular jazz fucking station. 
[02:24:00]  So I'm not as bothered as when, like, a guy that's given freedom on the radio, and then he has to be completely sanitized and not express himself, you know?  Well, didn't he sound, didn't he sound angry to you guys?  He sounded angry to me.  Yeah, the guy, his whole job is to pick out what jazz song goes with, with what jazz song.  So right there, you know that it's a pretty lame-ass fucking program anyway.  Well, I'll tell you why he's angry, because everyone that's looked at him has thought he's gay in the last, they don't know it's pre-recorded and there's a board up. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, of course.  You know how many times he's gone to the supermarket, and he's going to buy something, and someone's like, I love your program.  And he's like, oh, all right.  Yeah, I've listened every week, and he wants to go, you weren't listening last Saturday, were you?  It was a pre-tape.  That wasn't me listening to that filth.  I don't watch that stuff at all.  I don't even like those people.  I think God should smite them.  You'd never catch me watching that.  I bet you he was going out of his way to mention that it was a pre-tape.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Would there be anything else, sir?  No, no, I've got to go to work. 
[02:25:00]  You know, because I pre-tape last week, I wasn't even there.  I was away.  I was in Russia.  With a woman.  I was with a woman.  I was making love.  Everyone he talks to.  Everyone he talks to.  You have to.  He's squeezing in that he was away and that he wasn't doing that.  Yes.  Yeah, you look like, hey, look, this thing's ripped.  Yeah, you need some tape.  Speaking of tape, I was pre-taping last week.  I was very busy.  I was very busy in Australia, apparently, because that's where I sound like I'm from.  No, it works. 
[02:25:30]  It works.  When that episode happened.  Hey, that whole regrettable incident.  I didn't even hear about that.  I was very busy.  I was busy with a woman.  I was putting my fingers in a real far and deep and smelling them.  That smelled really good.  You know, I like the smell of puss.  It's going way out of his way to explain.  Poor guy just wants to move on.  All right, Sax God.  Thank you very much.  Sax God on Twitter.  Take care, man.  Bye, Rick.  What do you got there, Sam? 
[02:26:00]  I mean, this isn't the exact one that you described, but it's just a PSA they did for you.  That's another one.  The R word.  The R word.  Oh, no.  This has all of them.  Renegotiate?  This one has all of them?  Yeah, they say all the very naughty.  Let me say naughty, naughty, naughty.  Oh, God.  It's not acceptable to call me a nigger.  Pause now.  Now, with context.  Yeah, let's.  Let me see.  We need to know a little bit.  What were you doing?  Yeah, we need to know a little bit about you.  If you drifted into my lane and almost knocked me off the fucking road and I looked over. 
[02:26:30]  Exactly.  It's completely appropriate, sir.  You walk in and you're fucking my girlfriend and it just slips out.  Will you accept my apology in advance?  Now, that makes perfect sense, too.  Maybe you're tricking us by wearing that tie.  We don't know.  Right.  Tell us more about yourself, sir.  Yes.  All right.  It's not acceptable to call me a nigger.  It's not acceptable to call me a speck.  To call me a chink.  To call me a fag.  It's not acceptable to call me a kike. 
[02:27:00]  It is not acceptable to call me a retard.  I'll pause you up here.  I'll pause you up here.  So?  Is it misstress?  It's not acceptable.  How is this not funny for most people?  What's wrong with people out there?  Wow.  Holy fuck.  If this was on a comedy CD when we were growing up, we would have fucking howled.  What she's saying, though, and the point of this commercial is that apparently a nigger,  a chink, a spick, and a kike called this poor girl a retard. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, see, I didn't put that connection together.  Yeah, you're right.  And she was saying that it was inappropriate to them to call her the arm.  Low man on a totem pole.  It's going to suck.  Shit.  Go back.  Why does Jane Lynch have to be part of this?  Well, she's sitting there very somber.  That girl's on glee.  That girl's like, oh.  She is?  Oh, boy.  She's a glee-tard.  Go back a little bit more than that. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, the kike guy.  It is not acceptable to call me a retard or call yourself or your friends retarded when  they do something foolish.  The R word is the same as every minority slur.  Treat it that way and don't use it.  And use it all the time.  Spread the word to end the word.  See, to end the word, man, you have to stop that.  You're going to end the word.  You can educate people, certainly.  But you're not going to end it.  Why did Jenna Marbles come up for that?  I don't know.  Because she's fucking retarded. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  I kind of love her.  How many takes did Jane Lynch have to sit through?  Oh, man.  She thought it was a good idea at first.  Take 1778.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like any other ethnic slur.  Because she fucked up that take a little bit.  But you know they said, you know what?  This is the best it's going to get.  It's not acceptable to call me a waffle.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Whose retarded idea was this?  It's not acceptable to call me on the phone.  Cut.  That is acceptable, you girl.  All right.  You want to do lunch?  Let's go have lunch.  What do you want?  Bowl of paint chips?  You can see in that that Jane Lynch looks really tight.  Yeah.  She's been there for two days.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't like these Jane Lynches and the one of Sykes doing these things. 
[02:29:30]  Because they're supposed to be kind of like the edgy people.  They're supposed to be, you know.  Artists.  Yeah.  A little thing.  Anything goes.  Taking more chances than the rest of them.  Jimmy, you did a famous scene on Louie.  Let's not forget about the word faggot.  That's right.  With Rick Crone.  It was fucking brilliant.  Yes.  And by the end of it, after you all got educated about the word, what did you do?  You fucking laughed.  You laughed and made fun of it.  I have another Louie scene, possibly.  Oh. 
[02:30:00]  Isn't this great?  Isn't this great?  So?  Danielle's back.  Remember the one that ran it?  And then someone from Detroit called her a bigot.  So I knew she was going to call back.  Fudge, yeah.  I'm so happy you called back, Danielle.  That's a freaking Louie.  That guy?  Fuck him.  And I'll tell you why.  He's exactly doing something that we're talking about.  He's passing judgment.  He's passing judgment on a white person.  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm being chewed out by some jerk on the radio. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  The reason why I'm not at my desk is because I make fucking good money.  And I want to protect my over 140K salary.  How about that?  You McDonald's icon pushing faggot.  That's what you're looking at.  Icons on a cash register.  I'm so fucking hard.  Let's talk about entertainment.  For you guys.  Don't be a comedian and rant out on certain people and then, ooh, try and do a PSA and  take it back.  What's that about?  Yeah.  Be proud of what you, you know, go on the air and be funny about. 
[02:31:00]  Don't take it back.  And if I want to call my friends a faggot, I totally agree with you guys.  If you had any.  I'm faggot.  She's angry, angry woman.  Yeah, you don't seem like the nicest girl I've ever heard.  You sure don't seem like the nicest girl I've ever heard.  I've heard a lot of gals talk, but you sure don't seem like the friendliest man.  You know what it is?  People are afraid to have real opinions in this country anymore.  Exactly.  Except for me and you. 
[02:31:30]  That's right.  A whole bunch of other people.  What?  Opinions are like assholes.  They smell.  That's right.  It's fun to put dicks in them.  What kind of business are you in, Danielle?  Actually, pimp drugs legally for a living.  You what?  I pimp drugs legally for a living.  Oh.  Pharmaceuticals.  Bingo.  Nice.  Are you the one that drives around with the drugs in your trunk and brings them to the doctor's office? 
[02:32:00]  Opinions are like assholes.  They smell like onions.  Opinions smell onion-y.  People forget how to have a sense of humor.  I participate in your Cleveland steamer contest.  Oh, man.  Do you drop big logs?  It doesn't matter.  What happened to people's sense of humor?  That's what I'm talking about.  Well, I want an answer.  Oh, really?  To know it's two big doodos.  What do you look like there, sweetie?  I'm sorry?  What do you look like? 
[02:32:30]  Um, five, seven and a half.  I've got blonde hair.  I've been told I look like everything from a young, goldy haunch to Uma Thurman.  Oh.  Oh, look at you.  Let's see.  Oh.  Isn't she great?  Oh, look at you.  All right, Danielle.  We're going to let you go.  Good job.  I'll swing by your studios.  You can give me a look over.  Yeah.  I'll give you a look over.  Come on by.  Come on by.  We'll be here tomorrow.  Yeah, come on by and get a couple of fingers in the old cooteroonie.  All right.  We'll stick in the pooper. 
[02:33:00]  Gee, I'm happy with you guys.  Oh, you won't be tomorrow.  That's right.  You won't be at all when our fingers all have blood under them.  Opinions are like assholes.  They bleed.  Fingers are like assholes.  We have opinions.  Oh.  Gee.  Ouch.  That hurt.  Give a girl a courtesy of a rich round while you're doing that, though.  You know?  Got to be real.  Absolutely.  You can bet I'll go around here and start tweedling your damn clip.  Keep it real.  Keeping it real. 
[02:33:30]  A couple things.  Someone here, Richie Fast, says Sykes shits on other people all the time.  Fuck her.  And someone has given us the info that Jane Lynch has a retarded sister.  That's why she's on the PSA.  That makes sense.  All right.  I don't know that world, so that's fair enough.  That's fair enough.  Yeah.  I mean.  And let me go to Anthony on Long Island.  Anthony, go ahead, sir.  Hey, Op.  I got a question for you.  Sure.  All right.  You grew up.  I grew up five miles away from you in Colmack.  Ah!  What do you say? 
[02:34:00]  What do you say?  What do you know?  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  All right.  You knew what fag was.  You knew that when that little wormy Jewish kid who couldn't throw the ball for shit, and  you called him a fag, you knew what you were doing.  You knew what you were saying, and you're acting like, oh, we didn't know what fag meant.  You knew exactly what fag meant.  Well, when I said it, I don't think I was implying that he liked penis in his hiney.  Oh.  Maybe you're right, Anthony.  Maybe I did actually know that.  On a some level, I mean, not a nine-year-old. 
[02:34:30]  No, I know, but maybe you're right is what I'm saying.  Maybe you're, I would have to, all right.  Maybe I did know the definition of fag and faggot, but I guess what I'm trying to say  is when we used it, we weren't thinking that that person was actually gay.  Does that make sense?  It became this non-sexual orientation insult.  Like, the reason faggot's derogatory is because it's implying that you're a man who likes other  men.  Don't be such a man who likes other men, is what that's really saying.  Right.  But as kids, you don't think of that when you're saying, don't be a faggot.  All of a sudden, a faggot is just the guy that doesn't want to go out late because 
[02:35:00]  it's raining.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So, Anthony, you're probably right.  I'd probably have to explain that better.  You know what, I'm going to say, yeah, all right.  I must have known what the definition was when I was 9, 10, 11, 12 years old.  I'm not trying to split hairs here, but what I'm trying to get at is we all knew, even  at a very early age, that kid is different, and he's different because he's a puss.  And that's what we were trying to relate to our friends, that that fucking kid can't  throw a ball to shit.  So he's a faggot. 
[02:35:30]  And we didn't know any better.  But like I said, you know, you do get educated as you grow up and, uh, you know, and then  you use it in its true form.  But we didn't know any better.  No.  So I don't mind that people get educated about a lot of this shit.  No, absolutely.  I just don't want to be told what I can and can't say.  You look at where we came from.  We're not all fucking nutty people and shit like that.  We, you know, we're not all crazy people.  Our parents didn't do half of the crap that parents have to do now with their children 
[02:36:00]  that, oh, if I have to explain to my kids, you know, I was just like Anthony.  I grew up, my father would look at me and I'd be like, oh God, this guy's going to fucking  break my jaw.  You didn't ask fucking questions.  No, you know, you, you knew there was places you just didn't go even at five years old.  Be seen and not heard.  You know what?  Exactly.  Get the fuck out of the room.  Be felt and not heard.  Yes, I want to watch Archie Bunker here.  Now get the fuck out of the room.  My, my, uh, my kids, uh, two and just about two and parenting is exhausting and I'm learning 
[02:36:30]  more and more from like my sister and my brothers and stuff.  And like, they have to set up play dates all day long.  Like Ann said, it used to be just go outside and play with your friends, but that's not  good enough.  Now it has to, everything has to be fucking organized.  The door was slamming.  You're like, I'll be back later.  And you, you have to go on play dates now it's called and you have to go and now you have  to socialize with the parents, all that shit while your kids play because you don't trust  your kids outside anymore.  And then a lot of these parents I'm learning, they have to do the homework for the kid. 
[02:37:00]  So what, what, what you told it wasn't, I'm going out.  It was eight o'clock in the morning.  My mother would turn around to me and go, get out.  Yeah.  Get outside.  Turn the TV off.  It's like, fuck.  My parents never, black man are coming over.  My parents never, my parents never helped me with my fucking homework.  My, my sister goes, I got to go home because I gotta, I gotta do homework.  My father sat me down and explained school.  He said the three R's reading, writing, and that girl, the PSA. 
[02:37:30]  All right, Anthony.  Good call, brother.  Have a good one.  I think, I think you're right.  That's fair enough.  I guess I did know the definition, but.  No, I wasn't trying to like throw a punch in, but you know what I'm saying.  No, I mean, fair is fair.  Thank you, sir.  Let's take a break and take tinkles.  All right, we're going to go tinkle.  Actually, I'm going to drop a deuce.  All right, well, you've been doing it for two hours.  I meant to say three.  That was great the first hour. 
[02:38:00]  Yay!  Still on the air.  Oh, around the air?  Yep.  Play the poker scene if you want, or just go straight to break.  The poker scene's really long, isn't it?  That's usually a good thing.  I don't watch it.  Huh?  I won't watch it.  You won't watch it?  No.  It's long.  Is it worth it, though?  You're asking me?  It's a funny scene.  Yeah, I think it's worth it, considering what we're talking about today.  So, I mean... 
[02:38:30]  Six minutes.  You couldn't use the extra six minutes for yourself?  Fuck yeah, man.  Take this cock out and take a piss.  The brilliance of Louis C.K. is evident in this fucking scene.  Unbelievable.  All right, let's do this as we go to break.  Yes, it's high-low.  This is seven of hearts.  Five for you.  What you can do with this seven?  Shove it straight up your mother's shitmaker.  I don't think I'll fit up there.  Her ass is so crammed with all those dicks she finds behind the bus station.  That doesn't even make any sense.  Well, see, what Nick is saying is that your mother goes to the bus station and she gets 
[02:39:00]  like old thrown away penises there, like out back where they keep those, like in a bin.  She does it so much.  Her ass is just crammed.  Your mom really does that?  I don't know.  I don't talk to her every day.  Let me finish.  She just crams it in there and uses one of those coffee tampers, you know, for espresso  and cheese.  I got it earlier.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm not finished.  And she just shoves them in there.  It's just compressed.  It's like she's almost crushing dicks into like a dick diamond, like a pink diamond. 
[02:39:30]  And so, you know, try to get a carton there.  Okay, that does make sense.  What's that feel like anyways?  What?  A dick in the ass.  You're asking me because I'm gay?  No, I'm asking you because you're very learned.  Yeah, I'm asking you because you're the only gay person here.  Are you interested for any particular reason?  You need a breath mint, my friend.  Hey, Rick, is it true there's a club in the city called Jerks, where gay guys just stand  around all day and play with each other's dicks?  Yeah, city jerks.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you people? 
[02:40:00]  Wait, is there really a club like that?  That's not a club, per se.  It's like a floating party.  You meet in different locations every week.  And what goes on there?  Jesus, do we need to hear this?  Why don't you just shut up and learn something?  Hey, why don't you shut up?  Nice one.  Don't want to.  Well, city jerks is a gathering, sometimes in a hotel room, sometimes at a club.  And, you know, different places.  And it started basically when AIDS did.  They wanted to have a club where guys could have like a group sexual outlet, but still  play safe, you know.  So at this, you know, at these meetings, they get together. 
[02:40:30]  Some guys go one-on-ones.  Some guys go in a huddle.  Like do what?  What goes on?  You masturbate each other.  Jesus.  I thought masturbation meant only one person.  So you just stand around in a room and you jerk each other off?  Yeah, that's why they call it city jerks.  Well, you can just watch.  A lot of guys like to watch while another guy pleasures himself.  Stop!  Stop telling this!  I'm going to puke.  Is there a lesser charge for watching, like standing room?  No, no, no. 
[02:41:00]  Like auditing a class?  No, because you never honor a class.  What's a huddle?  You said huddle.  What's that?  It's a huddle where you huddle together in a group and everybody reaches in and you kind  of help yourself.  To cocks and balls.  Sure.  Oh, my God.  What?  What are they in a candy dish?  Jesus Christ.  What are you people thinking?  Like a quarterback of the hot ways like you, Sir Kel.  Brick.  Brick.  On two.  On two. 
[02:41:30]  What do you do if you're there and somebody recognizes you?  Say hi.  Well, you'll be pleased to know.  Everybody's naked except for shoes and socks.  Really?  Why the shoes and socks?  Well, after a while, the floor is full of...  All right.  I get it.  Christ.  That much?  Well, you got to put on some shoes?  Like Timberlands?  You need some shoes?  No.  Just regular shoes with a rubber sole.  Sure.  Something stylish, though, still?  You could.  Florsheim has some stuff, you know.  Or snowshoes or something.  Flip, flip. 
[02:42:00]  Flip.  Flip.  Flip.  Flip, flip.  Mud clean.  Mud clean.  That's another club.  That's another Jim's club.  Mud clean.  Mud clean.  You know, I know it's a free country, Rick, and I don't care what you guys do.  Thanks, Nick.  Next time I'm about to go down on a big, juicy cock, I'll remember, it's all right with you.  Well, like I said...  You should have that stamped on the head of the cock.  Nick's face.  Like I said, I don't care, and God bless you.  But I got to be honest, what you guys do, it really makes me sick. 
[02:42:30]  And not on a political Bible level, either.  I mean, just picturing you touching another guy's dick, that's gross.  Is that how you feel about what we do?  What?  Sex with women?  Yeah, you get grossed out thinking about pussy.  I don't think about pussy.  I don't care what you guys do.  You're the ones who ask me.  And you guys ask me this shit every time I'm here.  Really, I talk about gay sex more with you guys than I do with any of my gay friends.  You guys are obsessed.  Well, I'm curious. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know that I'm obsessed.  Really?  You, who says faggot on stage more than you say hello?  Hello?  Who says hello more than once on stage?  Who says hello on stage at all?  Yeah, hello.  I mean in life.  In life he says more than he says it in life.  Rick, does it offend you when I say that word?  What word?  Hello?  No, faggot.  Yeah, does it bother you when he says the word faggot?  No, it bothers me when you say it.  Because you mean it.  Yeah, but really, it's like as a comedian and a gay guy.  You're the only gay comic I know.  Do you think I shouldn't be using that word on stage? 
[02:43:30]  I think you should use whatever word you want.  And when you use it on stage, I can see it's funny and I don't care.  But are you interested to know what it might mean to gay men?  Yeah, I am interested.  Well, the word faggot really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire.  Now, in the Middle Ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches,  they used to burn homosexuals too.  And they used to burn the witches at a stake,  but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burned on. 
[02:44:00]  So they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots.  So that's how you get flaming faggot.  So what you're saying is gay people are a good alternative fuel source.  So they get the term diesel dyke.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  You might want to know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them  when they're being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. 
[02:44:30]  So when you say it, it kind of brings it all back up.  But, you know, by all means use it, get your laughs, but, you know, now you know what it means.  Okay, thanks, faggot.  We'll keep that in mind.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the individuals 
[02:45:00]  whose contributions have shaped the African-American community  and changed all of us for the better.  Today we honor Mayor Goldie Wilson.  As an esteemed mayor of Hill Valley, Goldie showed the black youth of America  that they, too, could become mayor simply because they like the way the name sounds.  And while Hill Valley went to shit under his watch,  Goldie Wilson was still the mayor and was black. 
[02:45:30]  What do you let those boys push you around like that for?  Well, they're bigger than me.  Stand tall, boy.  Have some respect for yourself.  Don't you know if you let people walk over you now,  they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life.  Look at me.  You think I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this slop house?  Watch it, Goldie.  No, sir.  I'm going to make something of myself.  I'm going to night school.  And one day I'm going to be somebody.  That's right.  He's going to be mayor.  Mayor.  Now, that's a good idea.  I could run for mayor.  A colored mayor.  That'll be the day. 
[02:46:00]  You wait and see, Mr. Carruthers.  I will be mayor.  I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley.  And I'm going to clean up this town.  Good.  You can start by sweeping the floor.  Mayor Goldie Wilson.  I like the sound of that.  Goldie Wilson.  Proof that white or black,  you don't have to be skilled or productive to be the mayor.  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History Month here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[02:46:30]  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  FU.  FU.  FU.  Hey, this FU goes out to the governor of New Jersey.  Flagged at half-mast for that fucking druggie Whitney Houston.  Half-mast is reserved for the servicemen and people who serve this country.  FU.  You fat fuck.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big FU to the security guard.  I'm just walking around all day going,  Good morning. 
[02:47:00]  Good morning.  I can't stop.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this FU goes out to the same primetime robbery.  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a fuck you to this girl that I was...  I met her in college and she rubbed up against me and she was giving me attention and it turns out she has a boyfriend.  Uh, now she wants nothing to do with me, but I keep messaging her and she still wants nothing to do with me.  Uh, fuck you. 
[02:47:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to myself.  My wife's away on business for four days and I'm not too much going to push you to fucking get a girl from Craiglist to come over.  Fuck you, me.  Fuck you.  This fuck you is a role and then a stupid Bruce obsession.  Next time you're whacking off to Bruce, I hope the load hits you in the eye and you can't see for a week.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give an FU to the Opie and Anthony show for bullying E-Rock and calling him fat.  Honestly, that's hurtful and bad. 
[02:48:00]  Don't call him fat.  Fuck you.  I like to send a big fuck you to whoever does the...  Uh, fuck.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Nick Swartzen.  Hey, this is Dimitri Martin.  Hello.  It's Ricky Gervais now.  Yes, hello.  This is not Kevin Pollack.  Hi.  This is Stephen Merchant.  Thank you for listening to the Anthony Opie... 
[02:48:30]  Who is it?  Opie and Anthony.  Is there a discussion on who goes first?  Is it always Opie?  Anyway, Opie and Anthony, you know him by now.  If you're fans, you love us while you're listening.  There's a stronger hammer.  Call me.  Alright, we're rolling along here.  Anybody had problems with their goddamn emails being, like, hacked?  Yes, all AOLs are hacked.  They've been hacked.  Not AOLs, like, fucking everything.  Yahoo.  Gmail.  Gmail.  Fucking, fucking, uh, Mac. 
[02:49:00]  Mac?  Yeah, yeah, MacMail and shit.  Uh, yesterday...  Everything I had was hacked.  Everything.  All my email accounts.  My Facebook.  Like, like, everything.  I had to just change the passwords and everything and fucking do all that happy horse shit.  Did they make duty jokes on your Facebook page?  No, no one did anything.  But all of my passwords were changed.  It's probably a computer that did it then, like...  Yeah, that's what I'm assuming.  It's a computer that probably did it to send out spam and stuff. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, but I got...  I caught it immediately, and, uh...  But it's just...  It keeps happening.  It's like, attempts are being made all the time.  I get emails that say, an attempt was made to change your password.  It's like, motherfucker, man, can they do something about this?  Do you have the same...  Or did you have the same password for everything?  No.  All different passwords.  And believe me, they have passwords now that are so fucking random.  They're getting...  You know that they're getting in through some other thing you might have tied into it?  Do you have some...  Do you have, like, um...  No!  Like, my password is... 
[02:50:00]  That's a good password.  What do you spell with a semicolon after?  What a semicolon are.  No, you gotta be...  You gotta always change your stuff, man.  It's, uh...  I know, you really do always have to change it.  But, like, yesterday, both of my email accounts were compromised.  Oh, boy.  And then I had to use one to get the password for the other one, but I couldn't because they were both fucked up.  So I had to go to the secret questions and all that shit.  And it's just one of these things that are just, like...  See, your password's too complicated. 
[02:50:30]  I go with really easy passwords.  No, I've gone with easy ones.  No one's ever gonna go...  Butter!  There's no way!  It's dog!  I've gone with easy ones.  You have.  Now it's a combination of letters and numbers that are just so random and fucking silly.  And they still cracked it?  And they fucking have been nailing it.  And, uh...  I don't understand, like...  That's because you're talking bad about the government.  Maybe that's it.  It's anonymous.  Well, here's...  No, anonymous would appreciate that, right?  There's another thing that kind of happened.  I'm getting these phone calls from Missouri, and it's just beep, beep, like it's something 
[02:51:00]  searching for a fax machine.  So I dial it back, and it's a fax machine.  And that just kept rolling in, rolling in.  And then the people that were hacking my passwords, I checked where they were logged in from.  Missouri.  So that's like...  Something's going on in Missouri.  Something's going on in Missouri.  I don't know.  How'd you check where they're logged in from?  Does your phone actually...  What?  What's that?  How'd you check where they're logged in from?  Oh, with Yahoo, you can see your login history. 
[02:51:30]  See if it's you or, you know, Romania is logging in or something.  But you would think if they can log that, that you can have a setting that says something  like, if I'm logged in from a different location that's further than, you know, 500 miles away  within 24 hours, you have to check, you know, a few things.  You have to go through a security procedure.  You got some spyware.  Just something.  You got spyware on your computer.  You know what?  That might be spyware. 
[02:52:00]  It might be from...  You're going to have to clean up your computer a little bit.  You might have a keystroke tracker on your computer.  You're going to have to scrub it.  You know what?  You're going to have to scrub.  Do a little scrubbing.  I haven't logged in from my computer in a while.  I use my phone a lot.  So it's...  But you must have done...  You might have done it once if it's a keystroke tracker.  It's the only way.  There's no way they're going to crack a fucking complicated password.  They're trapping it like...  You know how long that would take?  Right.  They're saying it's Yakov Shmiernoff in Branson.  That's right.  In Missouri.  You didn't appreciate what you had to say about it.  He's angry. 
[02:52:30]  Anybody know how that can be done?  Like, what's going on?  It's spyware.  Yeah, they can hack the phone.  I think it is spyware.  Spyware.  You're right.  Spyware.  Hey, does your phone actually ring at this point?  No.  It vibrates.  No, I got my people trained to the point where if my phone actually rings, I know it's a telemarketer now.  Really?  Nine out of ten times.  Nine out of ten times.  Yeah, no one calls me.  When my phone rings, it's a telemarketer.  Backdoor Trojan Malware Virus?  Oh, fuck.  You don't want that.  Backdoor Trojan Malware Virus? 
[02:53:00]  Is that a girl's name?  How did you get that?  Like, what is it?  Can someone call up and tell us what that is?  I'm fascinated with this stuff.  I know.  It's definitely a keystroke hatch.  It is, right?  Yes.  What's a Backdoor Trojan Malware Virus?  Spyware.  Backdoor Trojan Malware Virus.  Malware Virus.  Backdoor Trojan Malware Virus.  On my fucking MacBook?  Backware Trojan.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You got a MacBook.  It's fucking, come on.  Backware Trojan Malware Virus.  I know.  Backware Trojan Malware Virus.  Malware Virus.  That's why I don't trust Apple. 
[02:53:30]  They're in cahoots with somebody.  Not on a Mac.  You got to get rid of that Apple shit.  It's my Mac.  I only use Mac.  It's a Wham-O.  I only use Macs.  All right, listen.  We got a couple things.  I think it's spyware.  If we get info, we'll pass it along to you.  Donald Trump is yapping.  We like when Donald Trump yaps.  I don't even know if he means what he says.  But remember the whole Ryan Seacrest thing with Sacha Baron Cohen?  Oh, yes.  A lot of people are very suspicious that Ryan Seacrest was in on this.  Was in on it.  Well, they'll always be suspicious of that. 
[02:54:00]  Well, he had an extra jacket, too.  Who brings an extra jacket to the Oscars if you're doing the red carpet?  They might, yeah.  For what reason?  Just in case?  Yeah, but that type of thing is just not going to happen.  Well, maybe something else.  Once in a lifetime.  No, not even once in a lifetime.  What if he meets Brad Pitt and comes in his pants and gets his jacket?  But he brought an extra jacket, so that got a lot of people suspicious.  What could possibly go wrong on the red carpet in general where you might need one?  Could rain, sweaty.  Yeah, that's true.  Piss.  But people are suspicious that he was in on it. 
[02:54:30]  Ryan Seacrest.  Don't throw a shit at you.  Ryan's saying he wasn't.  But Donald Trump had a pipe in.  Oh, no.  Donald Trump likes to pipe in with the big stories.  He does, right?  To get a little press.  This third-rate character named Sasha Baron Cohen thought he was being...  He's not a third...  Yeah.  He did a hundred million dollar comedy, and what he did was funny.  Yeah.  It was genuine.  Donald Trump thinks he has a good sense of humor.  Right.  But he has a powerful guy sense of humor, which is it's very regimented and very much where 
[02:55:00]  he is never the butt of the...  It's like, Donald, you're not a particularly funny guy.  You're wrong.  He likes to think he's funny.  Sasha Baron Cohen is brilliant, and he really is.  Yes.  And he's ballsy.  Funny guy.  That made me laugh out loud when I saw that.  Fucking spilling Kim Jong-il's ashes on the host.  On the fucking red carpet hose.  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious.  Mixed it up a little bit.  That's what comedy should be.  It was nothing horrible.  He didn't throw paint on him. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  It was fixable.  Third-rate.  Ali G was a massive success.  But this Sasha Baron is known around the world.  It was brilliant what he did, those interviews.  He never broke character.  Right.  Bora, he has balls.  Third-rate.  It was amazing.  Totally an original.  An amazing comedy.  Yeah, exactly original.  Bruno, I almost watched.  Is Bruno good?  I haven't seen it.  Yeah.  It's funny.  I try to rent it.  It's not as funny as Borat, but it's funny.  Try to rent it.  I was in this hotel in Long Island.  For some reason, they blocked their fucking... 
[02:56:00]  Tries to seduce...  On demand.  Tries to seduce Ron Paul in a hotel room.  Oh, really?  With hidden cameras, yeah.  Ron Paul was really pissed about it.  I did see that one.  Yeah, okay.  Just wasn't as good as Borat?  I don't think it was...  Fell short.  I don't think it was as good as Borat, but it's tough to come back from something like Borat.  All right, here's Donald Trump.  This third-rate character named Sasha Baron Cohen thought he was...  He thought he was being cute and funny when he threw ashes at Ryan Seacrest.  I know Ryan Seacrest.  He's a great guy.  And you could see he was visibly upset. 
[02:56:30]  It was disgraceful.  And the security guard that was standing to the right, he ought to be fired immediately.  That guy had nothing.  He is not capable.  He allowed this guy to get away with so much.  Believe me, if that ever happened to somebody with real security, Sasha Baron Cohen would not be in good shape right now.  He'd be in a hospital.  He would have been punched in the face so many times.  He wouldn't have known what happened.  I only wish that Ryan took a swing at him, and I only wish that the security guard that allowed it all to happen, number one, gets fired, and number two, go to school, learn about being security. 
[02:57:00]  You don't know, man.  God, Donald, chill the fuck out.  And what you should do, Donald, is maybe learn that since you're an entertainer, quote-unquote, why wouldn't you look at another entertainer, quote-unquote, and understand that everyone knew he was going to do something?  So the security guard should have knocked him down. 
[02:57:30]  Yes.  When they actually asked him to be a presenter one year, and he wouldn't because he wanted to come out as Borat.  He's a funny dude.  It was the most interesting thing that happened on that shitty red carpet.  Trump doesn't like it when anybody else is the center of attention.  Yeah, he hates it.  He doesn't like when anybody else is the center.  Now, you know the difference.  He's jumping on it.  But he knows the difference between that and him just throwing something on somebody.  You know the difference.  Of course.  Do you know how bad security would have looked if they punched Sacha Baron Cohen in the face for spilling ashes? 
[02:58:00]  Just kept punching him repeatedly in the face?  He's just a guy who really is humorless.  And he thinks he's funny, and he thinks he has a sense of humor.  But it's like, come on, dude.  How could you get mad at him for that?  Well, his new thing is just to comment on these big pop culture stories.  Was that in front of his desk there?  Yeah.  Yeah, he sets up a little camera and does a quick little video.  Oh, is that it?  He just wants to be this cultural icon.  He's trying a little too hard with this one.  Relax. 
[02:58:30]  No one got hurt in the end.  And fucking Ryan Seacrest loved it.  The video is everywhere.  He's stone-faced.  You want to talk about a viral video?  Holy shit.  And he stone-faced Seth Meyers, who was hilarious at the White House Correspondent Center.  As brutal as Trump is to people, and he's rough, you're going to curl up and act offended or wounded or upset because a guy hit you?  At the White House Correspondent Center?  It was fucking hilarious.  Seth Meyers, the writing was brilliant.  It was in poor taste. 
[02:59:00]  What are you doing, Donald?  You're a guy that lives to take the gloves off.  And you say that you love a good fight, and you're this ballsy, in-your-face guy.  And then you sit there and stone-face the guy because you're bothered, but he's making fun of you?  He's not bothered.  He's just trying to be part of the story.  And this bothers you?  Yeah.  He's not bothered, though.  It's kind of fake.  Jesus Christ.  It's phony, Jimmy.  Donald Trump's not bothered by that.  I want to like Donald Trump.  I really do.  It's like...  Like his son. 
[02:59:30]  I like his son a lot.  I like his son a lot.  Absolutely.  Seth Rogen.  We go from one comic to the next.  Not Donald Trump, but to Sasha.  Travis said this is hilarious.  I guess Seth Rogen was doing the Independent Spirit Awards.  What are those, even?  They put them on Saturday before the Oscars.  They're like, you know, the Independent Movie Awards.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  That's right.  Yes, man.  Kind of anti-establishment.  Yeah.  One man against the system. 
[03:00:00]  I hear that.  That type of deal.  Name one independent film that came out last year.  They counted The Artist as an independent film.  Why?  Because it was outside the studio system, I guess.  Harvey Weinstein?  I don't know.  Are you kidding me?  They have loose definitions of independent film these days.  Anyone see The Artist since they won all the Oscars?  You didn't see The Artist yet?  Nah.  You're not going to do it, are you?  You're going to wait.  For what?  Wait until I can see it in my house.  I got it.  What?  I got a desk. 
[03:00:30]  Where?  Well, the funny thing is, we all got The Artist, but we had to give it back.  They were very paranoid that copies were out there, right?  So then I get my copy back, and I was walking on 72nd Street in the rain a couple Saturdays  ago to go to my juice place.  I'm getting very detailed here.  Yes.  And on the sidewalk, I swear to you, I see a copy of The Artist and Moneyball just sitting  there in the same packaging that we got.  So obviously someone else got a screener copy of my neighborhood, and it fell out of their 
[03:01:00]  back pocket.  Oh, damn.  You took them?  And they're perfect copies.  You took them?  Wow.  Well, what else am I going to do?  No one else is around.  You could throw them online, too, and you won't get in trouble.  I know, because it's not coded.  It's not you.  Yeah, it's not coded with my name.  I could really fuck over somebody.  Yeah.  You should.  That's always fun.  I was supposed to leave them there?  I'd buy them off.  It was early in the morning.  No one else is walking the sidewalk.  I don't know how long they were there.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  So yeah, I do have it if you want it.  Oh, I'd like to see it, yes. 
[03:01:30]  And I got a copy of Moneyball, but you don't want to see that.  I've seen that.  Moneyball was good.  It was all right.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't Oscar-worthy.  I think it was a horrible year for movies.  They thought Moneyball was Oscar-worthy.  Not taking away from Jonah Hill or the rest of them.  Yeah.  Good performances.  I didn't think Oscar performances.  I felt like I was looking at Jonah Hill during the movie.  Yeah.  When you feel like you're looking at the actor, is it really a stretch?  Yeah.  I wouldn't know what it's like to look like Jonah Hill since it's been so long since we've 
[03:02:00]  been in the studio.  He wants to come back for 21 Jump Street.  No, of course.  Cool.  Not the Oscar movie, right?  Exactly.  So what do we do?  We say no to Jonah Hill?  Take a hike.  Yeah.  We tell him to take a hike?  We don't have to be nasty to him because I actually like the guy and I think he was  a nice dude.  He apologized on Twitter to everyone.  Yeah, but it's almost like-  I called him out on Twitter and he got back to me and basically said he didn't know.  He didn't know though because he wasn't-  He had to have known.  He wasn't getting back to the fans who were saying, do the show, do the show.  They were Twittering him like crazy. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, right.  And I understand it was just he wanted to do Howard and I got no issue with that.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  Do Stern.  It's like-  We don't even care if you do Stern first.  That's his thing.  He's obsessed with being first.  Go ahead.  I don't give a fuck.  Come in after.  I literally could give a shit.  But when you won't come in, when you just leave and your publicist only brings you in  for the one show and you were here first, that kind of bugs me because if it was done  in reverse, can you imagine someone who came up through Howard or he was the first one to 
[03:03:00]  put them on just coming here and doing our show and they, come on, it wouldn't happen.  Yeah.  So that annoys me a lot.  A lot of these guys step on our heads to get to Howard.  I think you're right.  It's so sad.  And when that happens-  You feel like you've built up some kind of friendship or a little bit of loyalty and  you realize, nah, you're just a head in the water so his feet don't get wet.  Russell Brand won't come back?  Fuck Russell Brand.  Yeah, let him.  I say never take them again though.  Just fuck that asshole.  You just gotta say no.  What a fucking prick. 
[03:03:30]  You know, it's just not-  Jack Black, remember?  Ugh, who cares about him?  Well, there was a time, you know, he did a lot of interviews with us and then he would  only come in for that dumb band of his.  Tenacious D.  Tenacious D.  Stop with tenacious D.  But also-  Terrible.  Tenacious D stinks.  And the only reason he would come in with tenacious D is because he needed help from wherever  he could get it.  Yes.  But when it came to interviewing him about the movies when he was really hot, when he  was in a whole bunch of movies in a row, and he fucking blew us off every fucking time. 
[03:04:00]  That's why we should never take them again.  The guys like that, you know, we all get blown off sometimes if there's a mistake, but when  it's continual.  Yeah.  And that word just punished the publicist.  Why can't I come back?  Howard's off this week.  I need to, well, tell your publicist.  Yeah.  Tough shit.  I don't have an issue with Jonah Hill, but I understand.  I understand what's going on here.  Yeah.  I like him.  I actually think he's a talented guy and I enjoyed him when he was in.  Yeah.  I just don't enjoy being blown off on purpose. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  I don't enjoy being better dealed.  Better dealt is the word.  I'm confused, Jimmy, because I used to bring this up and you used to say, well, a lot of  these guys just don't know.  You're right.  In this case, I think he knew because I think-  I used to say that about other guys and you said, no, it just never got to them.  Because I think a lot of times they're not being Twittered incessantly or talked about  incessantly on the show like we are.  So now Twitter has helped that along probably?  Well, I think it's a much more direct connection to people.  And in that case, I remember we were very vocal about it and very much actively pursuing 
[03:05:00]  it.  Right.  As opposed to a guy like Russell Brand one time, the first time, who didn't come by.  The publicist probably just said, you're doing Stern and you're doing this.  Okay.  But it wasn't like we were saying on the air, Russell, why aren't you coming by?  Why aren't you coming by?  And then people Twittering him.  There's almost like too much of an interaction in this last one, which makes it harder for  me to buy.  But I always give the performers the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah, you used to.  Because I guess the world has changed.  It has.  And sometimes you just get a feeling like I've been Twittering Don Sheetal. 
[03:05:30]  I Twittered him once.  I'm not angry.  He's not going to come on.  I'm just disappointed and bummed.  I genuinely fucking love the guy.  Yeah, he's good.  He's good.  But he probably has seen it and just doesn't want to.  And it's like, I can't say he hasn't seen it.  He's just whatever.  What am I going to do?  I'm not on his radar.  It's frustrating.  The Artist might have been an independent and Weinstein just bought distribution rights,  this guy is guessing.  Not from Scranton on Twitter says.  Yeah, it's a possibility.  I just bought a solid fucking film like that. 
[03:06:00]  Well, you go to Sundance or whatever film festival is and you buy movies.  The movie certainly is not going to make money, though.  That's a ball you want to buy.  Unless you make it on DVD, maybe?  Or foreign?  Maybe foreign?  Yeah, maybe.  On demand, maybe.  So here's Seth Rogen at the Independent Spirit Awards and he talks about Brett Ratner and  Chris Brown.  Oh, by the way, Seth comes in when he's around.  Every time.  He's great.  I don't think he's ever blown us off.  I'm trying to think.  Yeah, I don't know.  Not every time.  Without award season, we wouldn't know what good friends Clooney and Brad Pitt are. 
[03:06:30]  It's nice to see them.  Social environments.  And most of all, without award season, we wouldn't know what a horrible bigot Brett Ratner  is.  Which is...  It's good.  It's good to know.  I honestly bet, though, that Brett Ratner really wishes that he was organizing the Grammys  because they seem much more forgiving than the Oscars altogether.  Seriously.  You say a few hateful things, they don't let you within a hundred yards of the Oscars. 
[03:07:00]  You could literally beat the s*** out of a nominee.  They ask you to perform twice at the Grammys.  Ah, Chris Brown.  That's a good one.  Nah, it's funny.  That's a good one.  Well, I wouldn't say Ratner was hateful.  Come on.  Yeah, what did Ratner say again?  Fags or something?  He said rehearsing's for fags.  Again, that just means, you know, he didn't mean gay people.  It's like rehearsing's for fags.  I had a nice...  We bumped into him at that sushi place we go to and had a nice chat.  The one in L.A.? 
[03:07:30]  Not...  I'll tell you off air the other one, which is where all the celebrities go.  I've seen him.  I saw DiCaprio there one time.  Ooh, do tell.  Spill the beans.  I didn't get a picture.  Dish it.  Dish it.  I didn't get a picture.  Why wouldn't you?  No picture.  Because it would have been too...  Fuck DiCaprio.  I'd go right up and say, look, I've never seen you again, so we're taking a picture.  I thought of that, but I'm really...  I've gotten...  The more I've done Leno, the less likely I am to be invasive because I'm around...  I get lucky and I'm around a lot of people a lot of times.  And it's like, sooner or later, you'll wind up there with him or... 
[03:08:00]  And it'll be all uncomfortable.  Or I'll interview him.  I just went through all my Grammys footage, interviewing all the...  I got some good pictures.  Yeah?  I just screen capped him off the hard...  The real footage.  Good for you.  Oh, that's good.  Steve Martin photos.  I got 12 Steve Martin photos.  I had none.  Oh, damn.  Jesus.  Any angry ones?  I was looking at you like a shit.  No, but he did mention me, mentioned a bad thing.  He was very graceful about it.  And then afterwards, I still made him laugh, which made me happy.  Yeah.  Let's do the second clip from Seth Rogen at the Spirit Awards.  The Independent Spirit Awards.  Talks about Mel Gibson. 
[03:08:30]  You should all give it up to the people who made Drive.  It was really incredible.  I like that all the villains were Jewish.  I thought that was really cool.  Seriously, that movie made Jews look so scary, I thought Mel Gibson directed it.  Is he here?  He's not f***ing here.  Damn, he's killing.  Look at him go.  Been loving Seth Rogen.  And speaking of award shows.  Oh.  I got my little email from the Shorty Awards. 
[03:09:00]  Yes, so did I.  I don't want to brag, but let me read my email from the motherf***ing Shorty Awards.  Shorty Awards.  I thought you didn't want to be nominated.  I didn't.  Oh, it's always nice to be nominated.  I came in and the email said, and as follows.  Hold on.  Sorry, gang.  Congratulations.  I'm being a finalist for the fourth annual Shorty Awards.  We would love to have you at the ceremony on Monday, 326 at the Time Center in New York City. 
[03:09:30]  And wanted to let you know that tickets are now available at shortyforeventbrite.com and at an early bird discount for until Friday, the 2nd of March.  Yes.  Please let me know.  So, not only do I do the Tonight Show and I'm on a radio show and I still came in third behind Smosh. 
[03:10:00]  I can buy tickets for the Shorty Awards.  You can buy tickets to go.  At a discount.  Right.  Go.  Fuck yourself.  So I wrote back.  Go fuck yourself.  No, no, no, no.  Are you implying I would be paying for a ticket to attend the Shorty Awards?  I have yet to hear back.  Oh, they haven't answered you back.  That shit.  Fuck them.  You motherfuckers. 
[03:10:30]  First of all, it should just be the voters that give the award, not your stupid body.  But they use the top six to get six extra people in every category to buy tickets.  Right.  And then you guys make the decision.  And then they decide.  Even if I win it, I don't want it.  Because the fucking bottom line is I didn't win it on votes.  Are you buying tickets at?  Well, I did win it on votes.  So, yeah.  You're going to buy tickets to the Shorty Awards.  Why wouldn't I go?  I mean, I don't care.  I'll go because I think it'll be kind of goofy. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  I just want to see what the whole thing is.  But you might not win.  I know.  That would be embarrassing.  I'm not going to go.  I wouldn't mind.  If it was all comics, if it was like Gaffigan and fucking Brewer and Jim Jeffries, I would  go.  I would compete with the other comedians.  It was like, whatever, if a comic beats me, at least it's a real comedian.  They're just, you know.  But you only want to compete with comedians named Jim, I noticed.  You went Gaffigan.  Do you know I didn't even think of that?  Wow.  Brewer.  Wow.  I didn't fucking think of that.  What was the third one?  There was three Jeffries.  No, Jeffries. 
[03:11:30]  Jeffries.  That's so weird.  You know what?  That's twisted, man.  You only want to compete with comedians that have a first name of Jim.  But I'm wondering, like, you just maybe taught me something about myself, like, do I, when  I think, very quickly alphabetize?  Oh.  Like, do I, Jim's, it's almost like when you're reaching for something funny.  We were talking in the break about Magnus Carlson, the chess player, and how he sees  things spatially.  Well, when you see things as being funny, you're like, for me, it works, like, you know, 
[03:12:00]  like, if you say, like, you know, what do I look like to you?  Immediately, like, you just, in front of you.  Right.  You see all these, you don't see them.  I know what you mean.  But that's, it's like you're grabbing for, you're not acting.  Something as quickly as possible, you want to throw something in there.  What do I look like?  You know, like, and all these pieces come together in front of your face.  Horrible, gross, insulting.  A bag of shit!  And it happens, like, that quickly.  But it has to all be, in a weird way, you can't clarify what any of it is, but it's  all laid out in front of you. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I can't really describe it, but that's how it works.  And I'm wondering now, like, is part of that alphabetizing, why would I have said fucking  three Jim's in a row and I'm Jim?  That was, dude, that was, and I was reaching for names.  I was like, ah, I even thought black, like, black can be, I just, I was in that moment  reaching for names, and I pulled out three Jim's.  Yeah.  Creepy.  I didn't realize, I didn't mean to do that.  I know I'm being very boring right now.  No, no, it probably is some type of fucking metal thing you got.  Or a spatial.  Yeah.  I bet you were molested. 
[03:13:00]  I hope I was.  That's gotta be.  A guy named Jim, in a gym.  And they had, they couldn't open my car door, so they had to, you know, they had to meet  it.  And they drove a Jeep.  I was molested in a Jeep, a Jeep Jimmy, and in a gymnasium by a guy named Jim, who jimmied  the car open.  They just came in my mouth.  Jesus.  Some Jim, Jim's them. 
[03:13:30]  No.  Say that.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  Why would I think all the Jim's?  I'm saying Jimmy Kimmel may host the Oscars next year.  He'd probably be good.  I think so.  That could be good.  He might be a little too edgy.  Nah, they'd have to go in a different direction than Billy Crystal, for sure.  Nah, I think Kimmel could keep it between the lines.  Little edge, but he understands what the gig's all about.  And they all do his shows.  They all like him.  Yeah.  I heard he had a great Oscar bit.  It was all over the place.  What was it?  It's long.  It's long, but. 
[03:14:00]  What was it?  High praise.  Just goofing on the movies and stuff.  Oh.  It's long.  You might want to do it in your own time.  Movie the movie?  Yeah, movie the movie, right.  You might be too visual.  See your true colors.  That's him singing.  No, it's nasty.  It's good.  That wasn't Jimmy Kimmel singing?  See your true colors.  I'm going to take a little nap.  Why don't you guys take it?  Let's fly low.  New York's new Powerball.  The possibilities are endless.  Maybe Lauper still dresses like that.  I don't know. 
[03:14:30]  I can't see the TV because Sam's watching over the by himself.  A werewolf comes along with a guy, a girl, a werewolf, and an ancient scroll at a wedding between the world's most dangerous secret agent and the president of the United States.  You complete me.  We complete each other.  And we complete America.  You may paves this fine. 
[03:15:00]  With a no-nonsense rookie cup.  It's visual.  Yeah, part of it is seeing all the people.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They got a lot of cameos.  There's a fuckload of people in this.  Yeah, it's called Movie the Movie.  It's worth watching.  Plus, it's like high praise.  Eight and a half minutes long.  Eight and a half minutes.  Oh, fuck.  What's wrong with that?  Jeez, man.  We got to teach you a few more things.  You're not ready to go out on your own.  You haven't learned everything from us.  No, no.  There's still a few last lessons.  Yeah, man.  You don't have to fucking give it your all.  We already did an eight-minute bit today, though. 
[03:15:30]  No, he's right.  Stop getting in your radio licks.  I don't either.  People love their shoes.  What?  They love their shoes.  Oh, is this another problem?  I don't know.  I know in my neighborhood, people line up before the shoe stores open to get shoes.  I don't get this.  I don't get this culture at all.  They're obviously wearing something when they stand there, so.  I used to like getting a brand-new pair of sneakers every once in a while, but not to the point where I'm going to wait outside.  Why are they waiting outside, Sam? 
[03:16:00]  Because they're sneaker heads.  What is a sneaker head?  And they end up not even wearing the sneakers ever.  No, it's a shoe collector.  And then what happens to the shoes?  There's some.  Sometimes they're worn for special occasions.  But let's say you don't wear the shoes.  You just keep them in a box in a closet?  Yeah, they might be.  So then why buy them?  They might be displayed.  They might be.  Some are going to be resold.  I understand displaying them.  Yeah.  I mean, if you don't have a display.  Sometimes you just keep them for a rainy day, thinking one day there'll be an occasion special enough for me to wear them. 
[03:16:30]  Patrice used to talk about sneakers.  And it used to blow my mind that he would buy sneakers and wear them once.  Not once.  I don't understand that.  Pat once.  Because once there's a scuff on it.  So why can't you wear them twice or a few times before the scuff happens?  Because once people have seen you with them, you wear them at a place where a lot of people are going to see you.  And then you can't let those people see you wearing them.  So then why don't you wear them to just kick around your neighborhood?  No, no.  Because then they might get scuffed. 
[03:17:00]  You can't just wear them around your neighborhood.  I don't get that.  I don't understand this.  It's a collecting thing.  No, I understand collecting them and displaying them.  I don't understand the people that actually do buy sneakers, wear them once and throw them away.  I don't know if they throw them away.  Because they're not the special ones that you would end up collecting.  Because you can't have, in a lot of, they don't feel comfortable wearing old sneakers.  Right.  They're not old if you're wearing them once.  Well, once they get marks on them, they're done.  They're toasted.  They're finished.  I'm so glad I don't give a fuck about my sneakers. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I know.  My sneakers look like fucking, like, I think I'd run about a tracker.  I understand an old pair of sneakers, sure.  But that doesn't happen, I don't know, three, four months in.  Easy.  I fell into it for a little bit, but I had to give up and just wear my Conference All-Stars every day.  So what do you mean?  You would wear sneakers once?  No, I have many pairs of sneakers that I've never worn.  Why?  Because they're like, make me understand.  Are you displaying them?  He's an asshole.  I don't have, the idea is that I would be able to display them. 
[03:18:00]  I don't have room to display them yet, but they're just in their boxes right now.  You're so black.  Because it's a black thing.  No.  You have a lot of black culture in you for someone that's not black.  Maybe so, but there's a lot of white people who collect sneakers, too, I think.  Not the lines I'm seeing, and I'm in a pretty white neighborhood.  So that means they're traveling from elsewhere to go to this certain shoe store to get the new sneakers.  Yeah.  You're full of turkey.  I'm not full of anything.  Oh, Jimmy.  Careful with the language.  I'm not.  I don't get it.  I get it if you're a collector and you want to display them. 
[03:18:30]  I get that.  People like collecting shit.  Well, sometimes, because sometimes, number one, you don't have room to display all your shoes.  And number two, you save them because you think there may be one occasion where you want to have these.  Like, oh, shit, I need to have some fresh kicks for this one.  What if you...  Let me break these out.  All right.  What if you save your sneakers for this big event, right?  Right.  And then you go and you realize, holy fuck, no one noticed that I wore these sneakers.  Then what?  Well, part of it...  Can you wear them to another event?  No, no, no, no, no.  Why?  They're done anyway. 
[03:19:00]  Why are they done anyway?  A large part of it...  Help me out here.  I don't get it.  A large part of it is you're wearing it for yourself and how they make you feel.  They're part of...  You know, they give you that swagger because you know you have these shoes on.  I would feel pretty good if I had to buy sneakers every week.  I would not be happy.  It is exhausting.  It's like wearing a custom-made suit.  Not everybody realizes it's custom-made, but you feel better in it.  You know what I mean?  No.  You don't understand that. 
[03:19:30]  I don't get it.  You don't get that.  Don't care.  I don't care.  Well, there are a bunch of dumb...  Well, I'm here.  It's a...  What's the audio?  This guy...  Yeah, but this guy wants to explain sneaker culture in the Bronx.  Brian, go ahead.  You're going to love the audio, by the way.  What's going on, guys?  How are you doing?  Hello.  Good, good.  All right.  First off, I am a movie guy, all right?  And, you know, especially in the urban areas, sneaker collecting is a really, really big thing. 
[03:20:00]  And I don't know what the whole, you know, huge phase is.  They kind of hype it up to make it more than this.  And they kind of con you.  They basically release such a small amount of shoes that they kind of make you feel like you want to buy them.  And what happens nowadays is a lot of people will go out and buy them just so they could resell the shoes at a later date so they can make a nice amount of profit on it.  And that's basically what causes all of this pandemonium.  You have a small amount of people who want the actual shoes, and then you have a larger amount of people who want to get the shoes and just resell them. 
[03:20:30]  On eBay.  Yeah, I mean, they're extremely limited.  All right, so it leads to this clip.  Chaos broke out outside a Florida shopping mall when a crowd waiting for the release of new Nike shoes got out of control.  Hundreds of people had gathered outside the mall in Orlando waiting for the midnight release of the new Nike Galaxy Foam Posit.  The UFL reports the hundreds of people gathered outside the mall suddenly grew unruly.  Police unfortunately in Wyatt Gear dispersed them. 
[03:21:00]  Foot Locker canceled the event in many similar releases.  Orlando Sheriff's deputies say nobody was hurt in the melee, but two people were arrested for trespassing.  It's unfortunate that it would have to happen over a shoe event, but it's something that, you know, we've been proactive in our responses.  Huge crowds also gathered outside a mall in Prince George's County, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C.  WJLA in Washington reports the crowd stayed well into the morning, even when the release was postponed. 
[03:21:30]  The shoes retail for $220, but reports indicate people are offering as much as $2,400 online.  That's the ticket.  Well, I understand reselling them and making a profit.  I get that part of it.  I don't talk about the people that buy them and then they don't even wear them or even display them.  Well, they're an investment.  You can't â€“ if you're going to pay that much for a sneaker or you're going to make work that hard to get them, you can't wear them because then you're finished.  Right.  Were they thieving any of them?  Anyone going for the 20-finger discount? 
[03:22:00]  No, they're not.  Jesus Christ.  It's really crazy.  Especially these shoes.  They're really, really limited.  It gets insane.  You know how it goes.  All right, Brian.  Oh, boy.  Well, that sounded raucous.  You've got to stay fresh, you know? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Just end the show.  Jesus.  Is that it?  No.  I've got to say this.  Rochester, three out of five are sold out.  Rochester.  Did a little availability Thursday and maybe the late show Friday.  All the other three are completely sold out, I believe.  And March 15 through 17, the Orlando, I'll be in the place of the sneaker riot.  Oh. 
[03:23:00]  And March 23, 24 is Uncle Vinny's.  And then, of course, March 29 through April 1 here in New York, Caroline's on Broadway.  All right.  Very good.  That's that.  See you tomorrow.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live. 
[03:23:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Happy Leap Day, everybody.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam Roberts and everybody else still running around.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim got out of here with the quickness today.  With the quickness.  They were out the door.  By the way, I was looking at Opie's Twitter last night.  Opie Radio on Twitter, of course.  Apparently, he was asked to do Dancing with the Stars. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know anything about this.  But he was telling all his Twitter followers yesterday that he was asked to do Dancing with the Stars.  I believe if Opie had been asked to do Dancing with the Stars, he would be on the show.  I don't see how he could turn that down.  But he says he was asked and he told them to fuck off.  Probably because of the LA New York thing.  He has to be in the LA for like a few weeks.  Missed the show.  You don't think he would take some days off of this show to be on Dancing with the Stars?  No, they came up here to â€“ they approached him and he said no.  You can't. 
[03:24:30]  You're not good at lying to me, Roland.  Don't.  Shut the fuck up.  Don't.  You shut the fuck up.  Piece of shit.  This is what Roland and me do all day in the offices.  Just curse at each other.  Roland just strings together profanities like he's the Bob Dylan of profanities.  He's a poet with naughty language.  He just sits there stringing together cuss words.  Yes.  It's something that you're proud of.  I am.  And people think like where â€“ they go, you hate Sam?  I'm like, no. 
[03:25:00]  He's a good guy.  But you just call him a piece of shit and hope he dies.  And while you â€“ shut the fuck up.  Piece of cocksucker motherfucker.  Piece of cocksucker.  That's where Roland's at right now with the language.  So, Roland, I'm glad that you're in here actually.  But first of all, Eric.  Yeah.  Do you think O.B. was asked to do Dancing with the Stars?  Did he say that he was asked yesterday?  No.  Yesterday he wrote on Twitter, I was asked to do Dancing with the Stars.  And turned it down.  I wasn't supposed to talk about it, but fuck it.  Oh, so it wasn't â€“ he didn't specifically say yesterday they asked him? 
[03:25:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay, because I was going to say they announced it at the beginning of the week.  Of course.  And he was not on that list.  No, well, they announced it yesterday.  That was what brought this on.  Oh, I thought it was Monday.  No, no, no.  They announced it yesterday, but we talked about it on the air.  You should have been here.  Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to Dancing with the Stars.  No, I thought just you'd pay attention to the show.  Do you think that O.B. got asked and said no?  Because no part of me â€“ no part of me as a human being thinks that if O.B. was asked to do Dancing with the Stars, he would say no. 
[03:26:00]  Would you say no, Eric?  Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.  Don't be a fucking smart aleck around you.  No, I don't dance.  What am I going to do?  You wouldn't be on Dancing with the Stars?  I would say yes, but I don't â€“  That's what I'm saying.  I'd be horrible.  Yeah, because let's get kicked off.  You're on Kimmel.  Yeah.  So that's an automatic â€“  If they said we're big O&A fans, we want some of the behind-the-scenes guys, we have Urkel, we don't have a lot of stars.  I'd say if you need a fat Mexican, boom, I'm there for you.  You're there.  I would do it in a heartbeat.  Yeah, I would.  You do the rounds of all ABC, GMA, see your publicity. 
[03:26:30]  It's a huge show.  Yeah.  Do you think, Eric, that Opie really turned this show down?  I don't see â€“ he hasn't given us any reason to lie about it.  Yeah, but why would he turn it down?  First of all, yes.  You know what the reason to lie about it is?  He lies all the time.  He just does it to get a rise out of people.  He does?  Yes.  Oh.  Mainly you.  He's just â€“ obviously, you're the culprit, but he lies all the time.  I don't know.  I just â€“ I stopped looking when it was always about yelling at Khloe Kardashian. 
[03:27:00]  Well, yesterday he was cursing out Gavin DeGraw and saying he was better than him.  And then one of the â€“ you could just read Opie's Twitter thing all the way because Ant took over the night duty last night on Twitter arguing politics with people.  Opie was during the afternoon arguing with people about the fact that he was indeed asked to do Dancing with the Stars and that he was better than Gavin DeGraw at life.  He said Opie Radio greater than a one-hit wonder like Gavin DeGraw, which â€“ and then one of the fans tweeted him saying, is this part of your bridge building that you were talking about that you were doing, shitting on Gavin DeGraw for no reason? 
[03:27:30]  But, yeah, I mean, he's got â€“ he's lying.  There's no way that he turned down Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  He would have been out of here so fast.  Right.  I mean, he would â€“ I don't know a reality. 
[03:28:00]  There's no â€“  He wore an Opie Radio t-shirt while he danced.  Yeah.  You think he would wear his own t-shirt?  Yes.  He's trying to â€“ he's got to promote his shit, man.  I wouldn't say serious.  I would just say Opie Radio on YouTube.  You know what shirt I would be wearing if I were on Dancing with the Stars?  Not Sam.  My Not Sam t-shirt.  The one that's so popular around this office.  And back your t-shirt, your podcast?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he's spinning around.  He had two ads for Russia.  Yeah.  How do you like that?  And they'd be like, Sam, we really usually have the dancers wearing nice suits.  We usually do formal wear.  I'm like, nope. 
[03:28:30]  That's not what I'm doing.  I'm here to promote.  I can't dance.  I'm here to promote.  And that's how â€“ why I think that Opie would absolutely do the show, Dancing with the Stars.  He's there to promote.  I mean, he'll do whatever, you know, to promote his shit.  Do you think he'd get kicked off from trying to take his own videos?  I think he would do something â€“ I don't know.  Like he'd be Twittering his rehearsals?  He would do something â€“ no, I think he would do something stupid on the show and get kicked off.  I think he would say something â€“ I think he would insult a judge or he would attack someone on Twitter that's on the show or he would piss off a publicist. 
[03:29:00]  He'd be the first person on Dancing with the Stars that yelled, I didn't do shit.  Or he would curse on ABC.  They'd be like, Opie, we give you a six out of ten.  I didn't do shit.  Okay.  We can't have you on the show if this is what you're going to do.  You think he'd just go out there and stand there and not move while his partner is doing all the dancing?  He would do something weird that we would all get a kick out of, but he just does weird things sometimes. 
[03:29:30]  And we would all love it and he would get kicked off the show for it.  I'm sure of it.  But I'm sure he wasn't asked to do the show.  He would have done it 100%.  Besides Dancing with the Stars, is there any other kind of reality show or game show, if you want to call it, that you would do?  Reality competition?  Big Brother.  Amazing Race.  I would do...  Yeah, Roland has always talked about wanting to do the Amazing Race.  Amazing Race?  You're one of the most slow-moving people I've ever met in my life.  That's what I keep telling you.  I'm like, you can't even walk down the stairs. 
[03:30:00]  It doesn't matter.  You know people in different countries, you get shit done.  The only way...  And Roland actually has a good point here.  Roland may win Amazing Race, and that is for one reason.  Sabotage.  You would sabotage every other player.  You would make sure...  You would...  While every player on the other teams were trying to make sure that they got the race done as quickly as possible,  and made sure that they were better, you would be making...  You would not be concentrating on yourself.  No sabotage.  You would be making sure that you were sabotaging them at every move, and then you'd just walk to the finish line. 
[03:30:30]  That's right.  I had to see Cooper have The Mole.  I love that show.  I like Celebrity Mole.  I love The Mole.  The Mole was a great reality show.  I always wanted to be The Mole, just fuck with everybody.  What other shows would I...  I would do pretty much any...  Yeah.  Big Brother?  I think so.  I can see you laughing there.  I think so.  I don't really watch Big Brother, but I think I would become very familiar with it, and I  would...  And then become the master.  I don't know if I would do Survivor.  I have very picky eating habits, and I don't know if the producers would allow me... 
[03:31:00]  No.  ...to bring sandwiches, peanut butter sandwiches, and chicken breasts.  I don't know if that would be allowed on the island.  No.  You'd have to eat, like, grubs and...  Grubs.  Figure out which...  Like, those little...  When they can't have their regular food, they've got to pull those little things out of, like,  decaying trees and stuff.  They're almost, like, maggot-like.  No, I wouldn't eat that.  You have to eat those and some other...  And leaves and determine which plants aren't poisonous.  Plus, Survivor already has the greatest heel of all reality show TV, Johnny Fairplay. 
[03:31:30]  So it's not like I could outshine him.  So that terrain's been walked.  That terrain has been whatever.  What about...  Would you do Tough Enough?  Hell yeah, I would do Tough Enough.  I would look Stone Cold Steve Austin right in his face and say, I'm the next big shot around  here, Austin.  What do you got to say about it?  And hopefully he would stun me.  Whatever it was, I don't think I would last long.  He just screams at you for 10 minutes.  Trying to get him to give me the boot to the midsection followed by the stunner.  That would be the goal on that show.  I wouldn't last long. 
[03:32:00]  But hopefully I would make enough of an impact.  You know what I mean?  I would do any reality show.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, I don't know.  I would do one of the ones that aren't competition, where it's just me, like, hey, follow me around.  Look at my crazy life.  I work at Sirius, and then I go home.  Would your fiancÃ© like that, though?  No, I don't think so.  If you had camera crews following you around on your daily life.  You should do the Bering Sea Gold.  That's an awesome show.  What?  I don't know what...  Bering Sea Gold?  Were there in Alaska?  You'd have to scuba dive to find gold? 
[03:32:30]  Bering Sea Gold?  I think he said Bering.  The Bering Sea?  Bering Sea Gold, yeah.  Oh, Bering Sea, S-E-A-G-O-L.  I thought he said Bering Sea Gold before, and I'm like, what?  Yeah, I thought he was talking about the woman who wrote Berenstain Bears who died.  I didn't understand exactly what you were saying.  Bering Sea Gold.  Cha-ching!  Yeah, I got it.  It takes a couple minutes sometimes.  Roland, for...  Oh, wait.  What is this guy talking about?  Uh, Jason, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Guys, if your fans were able to keep Springer on as long as they were, anybody would vote 
[03:33:00]  Opie off, that guy would be on there until the very end.  That's true.  We kept Jerry Springer on an uncomfortably long time.  He begged.  We kept Jerry Springer on so long that he came on our show and said, guys, I wanted to get  off that show weeks before I was off it.  I'm an old man.  I don't want to dance like this.  His legs were hurting.  And you're right.  He blew his hips out off that show because the people wouldn't vote him off.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we kept having our fans call up and vote Jerry Springer because he was obviously 
[03:33:30]  having such a miserable time.  You're right.  You're right, Jason.  We would keep Opie on that show.  All right, guys.  Peace out.  All right, buddy.  Troy, South Carolina.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hello, gentlemen.  All right, Sam.  The wrestling show, not so much.  Would you do Wipeout?  Yeah, I would do Wipeout.  That looks like a fun show.  That's adult double dare.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would pay to see that.  I would pay to see Sam on Wipeout.  I think a lot of people would really want to see me on Wipeout. 
[03:34:00]  I think the whole show should do Wipeout.  Just to see me get destroyed.  I think that's what people would really want to see.  Right off the bat, you do.  Yeah, just like going at like when they do that obstacle course and they go through that  wall, the boxing gloves are just punching out of.  And no matter if you duck, the other one pops out and he trips you.  How happy would the fans of this show be if I went on Wipeout and they got to see me  slow motion get punched right in my face?  Or the bouncy balls.  That's a little CBR.  This is CBR forever.  All right.  Thank you, Troy.  I mean, I think it'd be a big hit for the show. 
[03:34:30]  But yeah, and jumping off the Wipeout's a great show.  Roland, I wanted to talk to you, though.  As the talent booker extraordinaire for this show.  What did you think?  We were talking about Jonah Hill today.  And Jim was saying that he took exception.  He feels like Jonah knew.  Like Jonah specific knew he wasn't doing our show.  Do you think that's the case with these celebrities?  No.  I think they're so busy, though.  Like for all celebrities, the day of, week of, or two days before, or the morning of, 
[03:35:00]  they go, here's what you're doing.  And they just got back filming the movie, coming from a different country, doing press.  Yeah.  They have a list.  Like they'll say Howard Morning News.  He'll go, OK, great.  And just follows it.  So basically, it's not doing interviews isn't their job.  The acting is.  So like when it comes time to interview time, it's literally, all right, I'm the publicist.  I'm the press agent, whoever I am.  I'm going to meet you at the airport.  It's like Sandler. 
[03:35:30]  You're just following me around.  Like Sandler landed from Moscow, landed in New York.  His publicist handed him the piece of paper.  You're doing Letterman, Regis and Kelly, The View, and flying out by 8 p.m.  And it was just like, OK, great.  OK, whatever.  I'll just follow you.  When do I eat?  I mean, when I've interviewed people up here for the Sunday show and I pre-tape or whatever,  usually they don't know where they're going next.  They're just following Spencer or whatever, one of the other talent people around from  show to show.  But what about the Twitter? 
[03:36:00]  What about the fact that everybody was reaching out to him on Twitter?  Do you think is that?  But half the time he does interviews, the phone's off.  Right.  And so he might have seen that midday and been like.  Or after he left, turn it on.  And that's why he contacted Opie saying, look, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  He did apologize.  So that's the I mean, those guys, they had to do so much in the travel.  What do you think as a talent book?  You don't have to smash anybody.  But what do you think of a like the Jonah Hill thing?  You know that I get I think I get what you're saying with that because it was it happened 
[03:36:30]  once.  Yeah.  And it's like, whatever.  What do you think when you have a situation like Jack Black or Russell Brand, who literally  like their last several, especially Jack Black, his last infinity press tours, but Russell  Brand to his last several press tours, they stopped coming around to our show.  Russell was, I think, two or three other publicists.  So it's kind of like you build a relationship with one person and then that person knows,  OK, they love the show.  Then when they leave that person, you start at square one again. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, they don't know.  But you don't think Russell Brand at any point would say, what about my boys?  They ONA.  But the picture, they go, yeah, you have your favorite show like the E-Rock show.  And then I mean, let's let's think more realistic or the Sam Roberts show.  Oh, OK, I get you.  Then you go out filming for a month to a year and then you're doing other stuff.  So you get married and then you come back and you go, hey, here's a press tour.  You go, oh, OK.  And then you probably don't think about it.  You forget.  You forget.  It happens. 
[03:37:30]  You go through a lot of interviews.  Yeah.  Jack Black knows he's not doing our show.  Jack Black has not done our show enough times to know he's not doing our show.  But every time I see him, he's so nice.  It's like hard to.  He's playing the game.  I love him.  He's playing that Hollywood game.  You still love Jack Black.  I love Jack Black.  You can't say you can't say a bad word about him.  I have not one bad word about him, though.  He's like super nice.  He goes, hey, say hi to the guys and that.  So he's nice.  It probably is.  One of the assets of having you around is that you're so recognizable and memorable in the things that you say and how you say them. 
[03:38:00]  The people, they go, oh, I remember that guy.  And then they can associate doing the show and stuff.  So the other thing that Jim was talking about today was Weight Watchers.  He's on points now.  Can you borrow points?  You want to borrow some of Jim's?  No.  Let's say like you have like 10 points.  I was like Sam.  Here's 20.  Give me your 20 points.  So you're thinking like if you and E-Rock went on Weight Watchers together.  Yeah.  If Eric goes, man, I had a great day.  I have 50 points left. 
[03:38:30]  I go, I'm having a bad day.  Can't buy your 50 points.  Yeah.  We bump iPhones and then the points transfer over.  The points transfer over.  That would be awesome.  It would be a bump.  You would be.  That's why you couldn't do something like Weight Watchers.  It's too expensive.  I'm not rich.  Well, plus you'd be looking for the little loophole.  You'd be looking for anybody else on it and like using your points.  Yeah.  Somebody should create a cheat app for Weight Watchers so your friends could look at it and  go, look, I'm doing it.  I'm following by my points.  Yeah.  Like a little cheat.  Well, how much is the app?  Eric, do you know?  The app's free.  But you have to subscribe to the Weight Watchers service. 
[03:39:00]  Why do you have to subscribe to the service?  That's how they make the money.  Because, yeah, well, that's the thing.  What do they give you?  Advice.  Norton updates, you know, product information as far as food and stuff.  I think recipes, nutrition.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, so you're saying the data.  It's all connected to their network.  The database that Norton goes through to find out what foods are what points, you have  to pay for the database.  It's a small monthly, you're paying for the service of the Weight Watchers service.  And it's constantly updating as far as, you know, anytime a new soda would come out or 
[03:39:30]  a new cookie or bread or anything.  So it's constantly updating with new products.  I have the poor man app that says, you less.  Like, okay.  Yeah.  And then you go, eh, no, I'm not listening to you today.  I bought the other app.  It's been a rough one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me open something else.  Yeah, like the Cinnabun app.  That's my favorite.  It smells delicious.  The Cinnabun app smells...  I just close my eyes and still smell it.  Is Cinnabun your favorite?  I love it.  You love Cinnabun.  I can sit in my underwear and eat a whole box.  You love it.  I'll be happy.  That's pig as shit.  That's a pig as shit. 
[03:40:00]  Have you dieted a lot in your past?  Or not really?  That's not your thing.  I just cut back, like right now, for Lent, to make my mom happy.  I gave up deep fried foods.  How deep is deep fried?  Because you said deep fried.  That doesn't mean fried.  No, you think that's fried.  Deep fried and fried.  Really?  And sodas.  You're giving a...  You drank a diet of Coke yesterday.  You're going to win so many battles.  Okay, so you've already broken Lent.  Have you broken the fried food thing?  No, not yet. 
[03:40:30]  So Lent to you is not give up, but cut back a little bit.  It's like Jesus.  You give him four options and say, at the end of Lent, I hope to have one accomplished.  Right.  So you go into Lent and say, I'm giving up, like, dessert, soda, fried food...  I gave up dessert.  ...and chips.  I gave up dessert.  And then by the time Lent is over, you're just good because you say, well, I haven't had any chips.  No, yesterday, my doorman said I want a slice of cake.  I can't assault the guy.  So you had a slice of cake.  I had a delicious slice of cake.  Because, like you said...  And then we played football, catch outside. 
[03:41:00]  You gave up dessert for Lent, but you didn't give up being polite.  Yes.  You got to have the slice of cake.  Exactly.  But you don't do the diet thing.  I tried it.  It doesn't work for you?  It doesn't work for a lot of people.  You cheat, though.  I mean, it's like, day one and two is fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  And then day three comes, you're like, yeah, fuck it.  E-Rock, you have done a lot of diets.  Not a lot, but a couple.  What are the diets that you've done?  Have you done Atkins?  No, I never did Atkins.  You've never tried Atkins?  No.  Okay, you tried South Beach. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Fat Smash.  Yeah.  Weight Watchers, you said.  Oh, Dr. Ian's.  That's Fat Smash.  Oh, is it?  Weight Watchers.  Weight Watchers.  Just recently, yeah.  You're doing it now?  Well, I haven't checked into that app in over a month.  Oh, did you do Slim Fast?  Did you do Slim Fast?  Slim Slow?  I kid, because I'm fat.  Anyway, I had one for...  I used to have them for breakfast.  Yeah, except you used to just have it to drink.  You'd have a full breakfast, and then instead of orange juice, you'd have Slim Fast. 
[03:42:00]  I used to do that.  I had a Slim Fast and eggs and ham.  You did that?  Yeah.  I'm like, this shit's not working, and they say, one or the other.  It's a shake for breakfast, not with breakfast.  That's fantastic.  I don't eat breakfast a lot.  A couple times, I'll order something, but usually I never do.  We have lunch.  You make up for it, though.  No, I don't.  No, I used to have one of those just for breakfast.  But then I switched to those naked fruit drinks. 
[03:42:30]  You're doing Slim Fast?  You have tried Slim Fast, Weight Watchers, Atkins, South Beach.  Fat Smash.  Fat Smash.  I never did.  Oh, that's right.  It was Fat Smash instead of Atkins.  And I didn't really do the Slim Fast either.  It was just for breakfast, because you're supposed to follow the whole program.  So what else have you done?  That was it.  You've never tried Nutrisystems?  No.  It's not paying for all the food and everything.  Yeah, but you, I mean, how expensive is it, actually?  I don't know. 
[03:43:00]  It could be pricey.  Yeah.  It could be so.  They're making all your food for all your meals per week.  I think it's like thousands of dollars for a couple months.  No.  Yeah.  Well, think about it.  I don't know if it's that expensive.  Yeah, but if you buy, if you go by the, I mean, if you buy every meal, everything.  Well, think about it this way.  How much a week are you spending on food?  Regularly?  I don't know.  Ask TD Bank.  I don't know.  You spend a lot of money on food.  You probably spend $100 a week on food.  Probably, yeah.  Well, delicious food.  Delicious food, right. 
[03:43:30]  Today's soup day, by the way.  That's $400 a month.  Yeah.  At least.  Minimum.  I would say, let's call it $500 a month for you for food.  Let's just say $600.  $600.  Okay.  Let's make it safe, right?  Booze and food.  Booze and food.  Well, you know, because you're not replacing booze.  So, $600 a month.  Now, are the diets much more than $600 a month?  Yes.  Or are you just saying that?  I don't know.  Eric, in your experience.  Wow.  I just looked at Nutrisystem here.  Is it significantly more than $600 a month?  For four weeks. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Where they deliver all your food and everything and your plant and everything.  For four weeks on sale right now.  Yeah.  Is $309.  That's cheaper than usual.  But their whole thing is $505 a month.  That's cheaper than your food normally would be.  Yeah.  That's for all your food.  But then you spend that one chunk and then you lose weight because you can't afford to go out.  Well, you're not supposed to.  You're supposed to eat the food they send you.  That's why you...  Bullshit.  That's why you spent the $500.  So it's not that.  But you're spending $500 if you eat out all your meals all the time. 
[03:44:30]  That's what you're supposed to do.  That's the diet.  No, no, no.  You're spending $500...  I mean, without the diet.  Like, if you're spending $500 a month on food, that means you're going out for lunch and dinner.  How much money do you think you spend on food?  A month.  Jeez.  I don't think $500.  You probably spend...  I mean, lunch used to be...  I had to cut down on lunch, too, because it was getting too expensive buying lunch in the city all the time.  Not for you.  You probably spend...  But you probably spend at least $350.  I mean, you spend significantly more than $50 a week on food. 
[03:45:00]  You'd spend $50 a week on food if you never went out.  If you never went out, you'd spend $50 a week on food.  Well, I also...  We also do food shopping and make stuff at home, too.  Right.  So I'm not buying meals all the time.  Listen, though.  If you never went out, you would spend $50 a week on food.  And that's for preparing food at home, $50 a week.  Plus...  So that right there is $200.  Plus going out...  You're spending $350 a month on food.  At least.  Okay.  All right.  So it's cheaper.  So Nutrisystem is not that crazy. 
[03:45:30]  These diets are not that crazy when you just add up the fact that they're giving you all your food for the month.  But you're being reasonable.  So, Roland, you just enjoy your food too much.  It's not a matter of expense.  I don't see Nutrisystem playing...  I don't see a clean chicken parm that you got a fucking egg on this here.  I can take a shit in sleep like a mother.  Eric, what was your...  Look at what Tony's saying.  Tony, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I got Nutrisystem D for Diabetics. 
[03:46:00]  And I pay like $235 a month.  And that's like 80% of your food.  You still have to put...  You still have to drink like milk and apples and stuff.  That's still probably not...  It's not more expensive than you usually would be spending.  No, it's actually cheaper.  Yeah.  Because I drive a truck and I eat out at, you know, different places.  And this is working...  You can lose about two pounds a week.  And it's pretty good.  Yeah.  I recommend it.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You know, I mean, it's not overly expensive. 
[03:46:30]  It's just, I guess, you see the number right in front of your face.  But it's for the whole month.  Eric, what was the shortest diet?  Was it SlimFast technically since you barely even did it?  SlimFast was just in the morning.  That's all it was.  Just because there's a lot of times I couldn't eat regular breakfast anymore.  Why?  You could eat the wall.  Yeah.  I couldn't eat...  Like, I wasn't eating cereal.  I wasn't eating...  But why not?  Because I just got sick.  Like, I would sit there and I'd feel nauseous.  We exhausted all our options. 
[03:47:00]  How do you do...  I don't understand.  But every morning, though, it's the same thing.  Eggs.  Eggs with this.  You get sick of it.  So you weren't...  Oh, go ahead.  So SlimFast was more appetizing?  It was just something.  Something different.  That's all it was.  It was something.  And then I wouldn't eat again until, you know, lunch around 12, 1, whatever.  We went down and got something.  Sick, man.  So what's the worst...  What's the quickest diet?  Was South Beach the quickest?  South Beach was the quickest because I went through the book and I just went, fuck this. 
[03:47:30]  Well, no, because you tried it for like two days.  No, I know.  But you have to go...  You don't read the whole book in one shot.  You're trying to, you know, prepare how the diet goes as far as what you're allowed to eat and, you know, finding recipes.  So that was like two days.  I was just like, fuck it.  Well, because...  And your excuse for that was, fuck it.  See, I was on the juice diet and then Greg Charles called me.  He said, let's go out, eat and drink.  I go, I'm on the juice diet.  He called me some names.  Was one of them pussy? 
[03:48:00]  Yes, that was one of them.  That's funny that Troy spent all that time to get Roland really into it and then it took Greg Charles two days just to get Roland out of it.  Well, it was also because Roland was trying to shove full pepperoni pies into the juicer.  It doesn't work that way.  That's hurtful.  But yes.  So you tried the juice diet?  It was going good.  I had like two or three days into it and then Greg goes, pussy, this, that, the other.  And you gave in.  You tapped out to that peer pressure.  Yeah, and then Greg goes, come on, drinks. 
[03:48:30]  Come on in.  All right.  So Eric, what went wrong with the fat smash then?  Nothing.  I went through the whole program.  Eric, something went wrong with fat smash.  Trust me.  I'm looking at you.  Does Dr.  Ian get the money back?  No.  While I did it, it worked fine.  Why did you stop doing it?  Because the bet was over.  I wasn't going to sit there and eat, you know, white bean soup and rice.  I'm not going to sit there and eat healthy if there's no money on the line.  No, that wasn't healthy.  That was fucking rabbit food is what you were living off all the time. 
[03:49:00]  Well, you look â€“ because it was designed for you to just lose weight right away.  Don't you think you were more healthy then, though?  But you're sad, though.  I was thinner then.  That's not more healthy than the way you are right now.  Because you're thin doesn't mean you're healthy.  True that.  Well, you could â€“ okay.  Well, you know what?  Being fat means you're definitely not healthy.  I'm not arguing that part.  Okay, good.  Okay, there's more skinny people who are healthy than there are fat people who are healthy.  Yeah.  That's fair.  And then what happened with Weight Watchers? 
[03:49:30]  What went wrong?  Nothing really other than â€“  Something went wrong, Eric.  Holy shit.  Let me explain.  Nothing really was going wrong with that.  I was logging everything into the app and it was doing all right.  And then I went to move and then I just got to the point where I was like I'm not fucking paying attention to logging every fucking thing I do.  And I stopped doing it.  So generally speaking, your diets, you give up on them because fuck it.  Generally.  I mean because the Weight Watchers thing was a fuck it.  The South Beach thing was a fuck it. 
[03:50:00]  The South Beach was ridiculous.  And the Fat Smash was kind of a fuck it.  Weight Watchers actually isn't that bad.  It's just constantly logging everything.  It's more work than it, you know.  Danny, you're exhausted by it.  You are a guy who's lost a bunch of weight and kept it off.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, I have.  Yeah.  So what was it?  How much did I lose?  No, no, no.  Are we talking fat smash, Nutrisystem?  And that's why I wanted to come in here because like the reason that diets fail is because you're â€“ all you're doing is going on a diet. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  So the minute you stop that diet, of course all the weight is going to come right back.  It's not a lifestyle change.  Exactly.  And it's just â€“ it's basic math really.  And what you need to do is forget about all these gimmicky diets.  Like a diet in itself is a gimmick.  Right.  Because once you're off that diet, you're back to square one again.  So you need to actually â€“ if you really are serious about losing weight, fuck diets, fuck a Slim Fast, fuck Fat Smash.  No offense, Dr. Ian.  But all you really need to do â€“  I know.  If you ask Eric all offense to Dr. Ian, he's still pissed at him. 
[03:51:00]  Like it's not this â€“ it's not this scientific method that we need to follow to lose weight.  It's really simple.  What is it?  Stop eating like a pig.  Okay.  Move your body.  That's all you have to do.  And it doesn't take that much.  Eric, have you tried those things?  Yeah, the eating bed isn't that big a problem.  It's so easy to not eat bed.  It's the other part.  Moving your body?  Yes.  Look.  I'll get home and I'll go, I should go exercise.  Just put on some Chris Brown records and dance.  You know what?  Shake that booty.  And hit some people.  I've been lazy with it too because it is hard to keep up with. 
[03:51:30]  I mean even when you're doing it, you don't want to do it.  Right.  And even though you're seeing results, real results.  You still didn't want to do it.  You still don't want to fucking do it, but you just fucking have to.  I'm not making excuses or anything for you.  He asked.  I'm just â€“ I was giving him reasons as to why.  I know, but I'm saying like don't even bother with diets.  Like I know Roland wants to eat his fucking shitty juice all day and grind up some grass  and dandelions and shit.  But at the end of the day, if he's not running around the block for 20 minutes, nothing's  happening.  He gave that up because Greg Charles from Caroline's called him a pussy.  So he gave up on the â€“ is that right, Roland? 
[03:52:00]  A big pussy.  A big pussy.  Have you ever â€“ well, Roland, but you walk a lot, don't you?  Yeah.  But you make up for that with the meals.  No, I don't have dinner really.  I just have like a lunch and â€“  Yeah, but you have to understand with Roland like you know, you're looking at input-output.  That's all this is at the end of the day.  Input-output.  Yeah, if you don't output more than you take in, there's leftover, okay?  And so whatever Roland is doing, no matter how much he's walking or being active, he's  still managing to at least have enough of a caloric intake to maintain his current weight, 
[03:52:30]  which is a fuckload.  Right.  Do you want to lose weight or you don't care?  No.  But not that badly.  Yeah, but I mean â€“  Roland doesn't â€“  That's true.  And this is where you have to acknowledge the humanity of it because Roland leads a stressful  lifestyle so it's like if he gets home â€“ like yesterday he's here until like the sun went  down and he's not going to go home and exercise.  He's going to be like, fuck.  And you're going to have a sandwich. 
[03:53:00]  Like, you know what I mean?  I fell asleep on the couch.  I didn't eat.  Right.  You know, you got to â€“ and part of it is that Roland's got a stressful life.  I just got to find a balance.  Yeah, that's right.  Just finding the balance.  Do you have anything at home, Roland, that you could use to work out?  Like do you have any workout equipment?  I have a full gym downstairs.  So basically â€“ you know what?  You're just a bigger piece of shit than I even thought of.  So wait a second.  Do you have a full gym in your apartment complex that you don't use? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you just go down there?  Just go on the treadmill for 20 minutes.  Do you have to pay to use the gym or is it taken right out of your rent check?  It's taken out of your rent check.  You're pretty much paying for a gym you're not using.  So Roland â€“  It's an amenity.  Yeah, right.  One of the amenities.  So what â€“ why not just go down â€“ like that â€“ it couldn't be easier for you to do  this.  On the weekends, I do like once â€“ I do one hour on the treadmill on a Sunday.  Yeah, but that's not going to do anything for you.  That's just not enough.  You do that, that's a start. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  It is a start.  But maybe try â€“ so why don't we add another day to the week and then we can take it from  there.  What would be better do you think?  I â€“ because I â€“ do you think an hour â€“ doing an hour on Sunday or doing 20 minutes  a day for five days?  He should do 20 minutes a day.  He should do every other day because that way it's not like, oh, every day, every day.  Just do every other day.  Just do 20 minutes.  Until â€“  Until that 20 minutes is no fucking big deal.  And it's in your building.  So like you can look at your clock and say it's five o'clock. 
[03:54:30]  You can know, all right, I got to do this, but â€“  I'll be back by 5.30.  I'll be done by 5.30.  I'll be done and â€“  That's if I get home at five, yeah.  Or you know what you do too is you just make like a five-song playlist or a four or five-song  playlist and that's your workout playlist.  Like what are some of the artists you put on your playlist?  Sub Bruce.  Yeah, but saying like â€“ but when you're on that treadmill and you're like, oh, Born to  Run is on.  That means I only have four more minutes of this shit, you know?  Like it's a motivator and it does work and it helps.  I just don't understand why â€“ like it looks to me anyway that Roland and Eric are guys 
[03:55:00]  who kind of want to try to lose weight but, you know, they just don't want to put the  effort in.  But if they did, if they just fucking focused on it for 10 minutes, they would do it.  What about you, Eric?  Do you want to lose weight?  Yeah, I do.  I know your wife wants you to.  That's not what I was asking.  Yeah, I do and it's just, you know, it's just laziness.  That's all it is.  Yeah, but you know what?  Laziness just breeds more laziness.  So what's going to â€“  And by the way, wait, wait, wait.  I just had a thought too.  Okay, listen.  Eric said that he couldn't stick to a diet because he didn't want to log his food. 
[03:55:30]  Meanwhile, Danny, do you know what Get Glue is?  Get Glue is a social network.  Oh, okay.  Fair point.  Where people go and the whole thing is you just log in to the app.  And you log what TV shows you're watching.  The sex bagel is the most active Get Glue user of anyone I know.  Because he logs in every TV show he watches.  That's â€“  You get free stickers.  So if I say, Eric, I'll give you a healthy sticker if you lose 30 pounds. 
[03:56:00]  Okay.  Sticker, yeah.  So what?  So the sticker is the reward.  But losing like 70 pounds and getting in shape, that's not a reward?  Danny, anything that you're saying here is not being contested.  One day I'm going to get through you, buddy.  I totally agree with him.  He's not saying anything that's out of line here.  I think Eric â€“  And I'm not fighting it either.  I think Eric would like to be in shape.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Because Eric is saying that he doesn't want â€“ like he doesn't care. 
[03:56:30]  But at the same time, I'm a listener, right?  So I listen to â€“  I didn't care.  It's just I didn't do anything.  No, go ahead and say you're a fan.  I'm a fanboy.  But, you know, it's obvious that Eric over the years, I mean, he has tried multiple different diets.  And not only that, but he's tried to get â€“ he's gone to the gym, gotten a trainer.  So there â€“  Oh, what happened with the trainer?  There's motivation there.  It's in him.  He does want this.  This is something he wants.  I just said, do you still have a gym membership?  No.  You gave up the gym membership?  Last year, yeah. 
[03:57:00]  Because you were just like â€“  It was expensive.  And you were like, I don't go.  Yeah, exactly.  How long did you have the gym membership for?  When did we â€“ it was â€“ it was actually right before we started the Dr. Ian thing.  Oh, wow.  So that's like probably 2007.  Yeah.  And you had it seven, eight, nine, ten.  You had it for like four or five years.  Yeah.  How many times did you go to the gym?  Out of a year, I would say maybe â€“  No, out of all five. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, out of all five, maybe eight months.  You went regularly for eight months?  Well, I did â€“ I went a lot during the diet thing.  And then even after that, I was still going.  And you know what was so funny?  That's when Eric was getting in shape.  That's when he was â€“  But he was getting in shape.  For the bet.  Except he missed the bet by one pound, if you remember correctly.  Dr. Ian Smith came in here.  He used to be on that show at Celebrity Fit Club.  Yeah.  And he challenged â€“ he was promoting his Fat Smash diet.  And I think â€“ what was it?  30 pounds in three months?  Does that sound about right, Eric? 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Somewhere around there.  It might have been less because I remember it was a very attainable feat.  It was doable.  Yeah, it wasn't that â€“ I was only like 20 pounds over, I think.  And Eric did well.  And he followed the diet.  And he went to the gym.  And he came in.  And of all things, stripped down to those tighty-whities, showed that big ball bag he's got.  I love tighty-whities.  Well, they were boxer briefs.  I saw that ball bag hanging around.  And what happened?  One pound.  One pound.  He was 29 pounds is what he had lost instead of 30. 
[03:58:30]  They call that Nagel's Law.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what â€“ the show couldn't have ended in a better way.  I know.  You did it again.  You're always giving to the show.  Now, I guess, Eric, there's a psychology of part of the work being the reward.  Not the whole reward, but the idea that the work you're doing, even though it's difficult, is on some level rewarding.  You don't have that.  I know it.  I'm aware of it.  I just don't do it. 
[03:59:00]  No, but it's a feeling.  Like when you're working â€“  When I do it, I get â€“ I have that feeling.  I understand what you're saying.  You do.  But when I'm not, and it's been more times not, it's just like, oh, fuck it.  I throw my bag on the floor, and I do stuff around the house and take a nap or whatever.  Because you're also like, look, a 12-pack of Cherry Cokes and a Doctor Who marathon is quite a reward too.  That's just entertaining.  That's just fun.  Eric is a motivator.  Like there's not â€“ he has nothing to drive for.  Like he's married.  He's a married guy, so he doesn't need to worry about the chicks. 
[03:59:30]  You know, he does okay.  You know, so he doesn't â€“ there's nothing to drive.  Like why â€“ if you're Eric, honestly, why would you need to lose the weight?  And he's got to find that thing that's going to make him do it.  Where's Troy?  Troy, if you're listening wherever you are, I need you in here.  No, no.  We need to talk to Troy.  Troy's not reasonable.  I need to talk to Troy.  He needs like a â€“ Eric needs like a â€“ his wife should say like, if you lose 15 pounds, I'll get you some Simpsons stickers.  Because it didn't work when his wife just said, I want you to lose weight.  Troy, have you been listening?  A little bit, yeah.  We were talking about, you know, diets and getting people in shape. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  You know, Roland, a lot of â€“ Roland, I think, does not have a problem with weight, believe it or not.  I think Roland's problem is with stress management.  And I think that's a whole other issue.  Well, he finds his comfort in food.  But Eric, his problem is with weight.  And I feel like the life coach thing for Roland, it was a little different because it was a stress management training thing that Roland needs, I think.  And that's a whole different thing. 
[04:00:30]  The life coach thing, you didn't work out.  I didn't work out.  Intern Sal didn't work out because he needs something different.  Right.  Eric understands the idea of work being the reward.  He understands how good it feels to lose the weight because he's ballooned from time to time.  Massively.  Inflate, deflate, inflate, deflate.  He's in a big inflation stage right now.  So what I'm asking you â€“ no, this has nothing to do with it.  What I'm asking you â€“  It has everything to do with it.  It's right. 
[04:01:00]  Will you be Eric Nagel's life coach?  Absolutely not.  Wait, wait, wait.  Absolutely not.  What do you mean absolutely not?  Because he doesn't really care.  He doesn't want to do the work.  No, Danny said it.  He needs a motivator.  When you said he needs a motivator, the motivator needs to be, why do I need to lose this weight?  Whether it be health, whether it be pussy, whether it be â€“ whatever it is, you have  to go, I need to drop this weight.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm not going to shove this food in my face.  Eric's fine with his health.  He doesn't like pussy.  And so what are we left with? 
[04:01:30]  Eric, was that out of line?  Yeah, that was very out of line.  Well, I'm sorry about that.  I'm sorry.  There was plenty of times on that fucking treadmill, like I would try to do like five miles.  Sure.  And, you know, you get to that third mile.  You're like, you're already â€“ you're done.  And you're like, I still have two fucking miles.  Like, how the fuck am I going to do this?  Troy.  And you just push yourself.  You push yourself.  And you go â€“ and you're on that fucking treadmill.  And you're just like, well, you want to get laid?  Because no one wants to fuck a guy with tits.  Right.  And then you just finish the fucking two miles.  And if you go to a gym â€“ I mean, you're at a gym with girls with hot bodies and you're  looking at them and you're like, fuck, like, I want that. 
[04:02:00]  You know what you do at the gym?  And maybe this might be gay, but this is what I like to do at the gym.  And I'll look at the guys at the gym and I'll see the girls at the gym and I say, that  girl is going to hook up with that guy because he's a fucking gym body, motherfucker.  Yeah, let's go.  I'm with you.  I'm more just basic competitive.  And we talked about this when I wanted to get on jury duty just because some people were  getting picked.  Like, I look at whoever's next to me on the treadmills and I make sure that they are not  going as fast.  I'm going faster than them and I'm going longer than them and I'm going farther than them. 
[04:02:30]  I like to be the last guy.  Like, if there's 10 treadmills in my little zone, I'm not leaving until all new faces  have arrived because I will be the last one.  Like, I won't beat them.  And you're laughing like, ah, that guy's already leaving, huh?  Like, we're in some fucking non-existent race and I just won the whole marathon.  Eric.  And sometimes going to the gym is not fun.  You know, you can also find things to do that are fun.  If you like riding bikes, you know, if you're near a park, go for a bike ride.  Yeah, but he likes sitting on a couch watching Doctor Who.  That's just straight up lazy.  Eric, you know your wife's a piece of ass, right? 
[04:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Now, don't you think it would feel good to be like, I'm a fucking, now I'm a good looking  guy, I'm in shape and I, now I get to, you know, well, I'll say fuck her like a champ.  If that's, I don't know, I don't want to be disrespectful.  Don't you think you would feel better about yourself if you were like, you know.  You'd have more stamina, you'd get more blood flow down there.  I'm sure.  And she would.  You're not noodling her, are you?  She would be attracted to you. 
[04:03:30]  Wouldn't you want your hot wife to look at you and be like, dude, my man is fucking hot.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Not like, look at my man sitting there on the couch eating Doritos watching The Simpsons.  Wouldn't it be nice that he's saying is if your wife was physically attracted to you,  isn't that the motivator?  Okay.  Well, what?  What?  I don't know.  It's hurtful.  I didn't mean it to be so.  But don't you see at some point down the line, she's going to be like, all right, this kid  isn't doing anything.  I need to fuck some hard bodies.  Oh, wow.  And then there's going to be some, I mean, there might be some, some young dudes, young 
[04:04:00]  strapping dude with a massive cock that's just ready to fucking plow that, plow it over.  That's one of the problems with having a hot wife.  And you got a hot wife, Eric.  You got to keep her satisfied.  You got to keep her happy.  What do you think of that as a motivator?  Does that motivate you?  Does that come into play?  Yeah, that does come into play.  Improving that Nagel sex life?  My wife just texted me, I'm buying you a bicycle.  She's sick of this bullshit.  Dude, why wouldn't you see, I mean, are you that just, are you that disconnected with what  your wife really wants that you don't even give a fuck that you're just like, whatever, 
[04:04:30]  I don't mind being fat.  I don't care that you want me to look good.  I don't give a fuck.  And I'm going to tell you this too.  Make sure you get the bell.  You're at a basket.  Your wife knows that she's hot.  And if she didn't know that she was hot, she's obviously listening.  So now she's aware that the guys here think that she's hot.  Okay?  At some point, she's going to be like, looking at you, like, what the fuck is your problem?  You can't get yourself into a little bit of shape for a hot woman like me.  They go to the man cave and go, shh. 
[04:05:00]  The Simpsons cave.  That's awesome.  What happens if your wife said to you, look, I need to go fuck a hot guy.  If you don't lose weight, I'm going to go find a hot guy to fuck.  That's what he needs.  That's exactly what he needs.  And you know what?  Honestly, I don't even think he would care if that, he'd be like, well, then go do what  you have to do.  I'll be here.  I'm calling this right now.  Eric has to lose 20 pounds in the month of March or Troy fucks his wife.  Troy?  I mean.  You know, last time, last time Troy told somebody.  I don't know what to say to that. 
[04:05:30]  Last time Troy told somebody associated with the show that he was going to fuck their  girlfriend.  I'm sorry, Angela.  And he did.  He fucked their girlfriend.  Well, you did.  Well, he wasn't associated with the show at that time.  Fair is fair, though.  She was fucked by you.  I don't think Troy's going to fuck your wife, Eric.  I'm not going to fuck her.  But he needs some serious consequences like that.  Don't you think that she would like to?  What about a handjob, then?  Fucking nice.  From you?  Yeah.  Or do you think she'd like to have sex with somebody who's in really good shape? 
[04:06:00]  Athletic Eric Nagel?  Eric just isn't fair.  I'm not arguing any of these points.  It's completely on the money.  But it doesn't motivate you, though.  Look, on my part, it's laziness and selfishness.  I'm well aware of that.  But can't you get past that?  I have to.  I probably could if I put some effort into it.  And the older you get, it's just going to keep getting harder and harder.  Yeah.  That I'm aware of as well.  That dick won't.  That dick won't.  No.  That dick won't.  When's the last time you got an erection?  That's a great question.  Mine?  No, I was talking about...  Okay, because today for me. 
[04:06:30]  Yeah.  This morning.  And I think we should further clarify, and not like I'm sitting in front of the computer  watching porn erection, just like, oh my god, why is my dick raging hard for no reason?  Yeah, exactly.  That happens every morning.  Nice.  Next time...  All right, we need an erection bell for Eric then, because we need some kind of alarm.  We have the shit alarm.  We have the E-Rock came to work alarm.  We need some kind of E-Rock boner alarm.  You need to alert us immediately next time you're erect.  Troy, is there room in the production schedule for an E-Rock boner alarm?  Of course.  It usually does not happen during the show, but... 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  When does it happen?  It would be used.  It happens during the after?  It wouldn't happen here.  During the after show?  No.  But that's the thing.  It should, because a healthy man should have just random erections at random times.  I mean, it happens to me all the time.  I want the listeners to know that I sit in this studio every day, sometimes you hear...  Many times, when you hear me talking on the air...  You have a boner?  I'm fully erect.  I'm sitting down so nobody realizes it.  But there have been...  I mean, multiple times a week, while I'm talking to you, the audience, I'm fully erect. 
[04:07:30]  Does your penis foreskin balloon up with pre?  No, it doesn't.  I don't have a foreskin anymore, Danny, and you know that.  Oh, that's right.  We did that talk show together.  No.  That was forgery.  Eric, I hope the best for you.  Thank you.  And I hope to God that Troy doesn't get his hands on your wife, because that is going  to be ugly.  Just with that text, she's pleading with you, like, please, please lose weight.  Well, it depends what kind of bike it is.  Right, fans are coming up next, along with three wheels.  In closing, when your wife says that it's time to buy a bicycle, it's probably not jokes. 
[04:08:00]  That's all.  And now, because she's listening, she's kind of thinking about just, it's in her head,  the idea of fucking Troy is in her head, and that's all I will say.  And I've talked to his wife, and it's not a joke.  No, I mean, with him losing weight.  No, no, no, I know what you meant.  I know what you meant.  He means fucking your wife is not a joke.  Thank you for listening.  And Ron and Fez coming up next.  He would, Angela.  Don't worry about it.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
