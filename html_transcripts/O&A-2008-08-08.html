<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with chaotic banter stemming from an off-air incident involving Steve's absence.  Drew Boogie was a guest in the studio throughout the show, providing musical interludes.  The hosts initially discussed the Beijing Olympics, commenting on the time difference and poor air quality, and sarcastically critiquing the quality of Chinese-made goods. This segued into a discussion about the attractiveness of female gymnasts, with sexually suggestive remarks about specific athletes and a comparison of the perceived sex appeal of summer and winter Olympics.

Opie then detailed his experience at a Police concert at Madison Square Garden, mentioning The B-52s as the opening act, commenting on Fred Schneider's perceived sexuality and the female band members' appearance.  The hosts discussed the Police's setlist and Opie's opinion of The B-52s and the overall crowd. The conversation shifted to the Boston band's upcoming tour following the suicide of their lead singer, Brad Delp, by carbon monoxide poisoning.  The hosts criticized the band's decision to continue touring with a new, YouTube-discovered lead singer who previously worked at Home Depot, initially misidentifying him as from the band Striper before correctly naming him Tommy DiCarlo and discussing his appearance.  They also speculated on Brett Favre's move to the New York Jets. Listener calls followed, focusing on the new Boston singer and other bands continuing after the departure or death of key members (Styx, Foreigner, Journey, Alice in Chains).

A significant portion of the show focused on various bands and their lead singers. The hosts and callers debated the quality of Journey's new Filipino lead singer, who, according to a caller, didn't speak English but sounded like Steve Perry.  A caller claimed Journey re-recorded all their hits with him and released them on a double album.  A comedically bad song montage by E-Rock, combining nearly identical songs from the band Foundry, was played.  The hosts discussed Jimmy Norton's upcoming nasal surgery, with callers offering humorous predictions.  Audio clips comparing old and new Journey songs were played. A caller recounted seeing the new Journey singer perform live.  Comedian Jim Breuer called in, discussing his comedy career and an incident involving smoking pot in a Toronto hotel.

Bob Saget called, discussing the annual Opie and Anthony Roast, mentioning only one "casualty" in the audience and clarifying rumors about his feelings towards the Olsen twins' roasting.  He also discussed his new CW show, *Surviving Suburbia*, and plans to go out with Opie.  Norm Macdonald was a guest in the studio, recounting jokes from the roast, including those about his father's funeral.  The absence of Artie Lange due to rehab was mentioned.

Shane McMahon joined the show, announcing the birth of his niece.  The hosts reminisced about past interactions with the McMahon family, including anecdotes about Triple H, Vince McMahon's injuries, and various incidents within the wrestling business.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the WWE, McMahonâ€™s on-screen persona, and the ongoing feud between Vince McMahon and the hosts.  A contest to win a trip to SummerSlam was held, featuring several aspiring wrestlers giving promotional speeches ("promos"). These included Striker (spelling debate with hosts), Mouthwash Jones (aggressive exchange with E-Rock), Type A (roasting a radio producer), Ultimate Warrior (incorporating a Rich Voss impression), Jabby Just Got Up (falling asleep), and Matt Massacre (Flea Man, offensive rap battle with E-Rock).  Jim Norton was absent due to his nose surgery. A.J. Poopy Shits, Sam Roberts's alter ego, delivered a Hollywood news update.  Type A won the SummerSlam trip; Striker received E-Rock's ticket.  The discussion included speculation about Sam Roberts' racial background, Randy Savage's absence from WWE events, and Bruno Sammartino's reported feud with Vince McMahon.

Sam Roberts, a show producer, recounted his experience announcing a wrestling match at his high school, culminating in an unexpected in-ring appearance.  The hosts and Shane joked about Sam possibly receiving a chair shot to the head.  They discussed the Ultimate Warrior's appearance, using audio clips from his website.  "Line of the Day" selections included jokes about female Olympic gymnasts' breasts and Sirius firings, followed by a discussion of Brooke Hogan's appearance and a closing announcement for SummerSlam.  The show concluded with a repeated "Sunday" outro and a final announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I say he snorts up the baby cockroaches.  Yeah, snorting cockroaches would be good.  Here we go.  The sounds of Steve.  All I can say is this is why Steve is not here today.  Built to a crescendo.  Sure.  What is that?  What was that?  What are you talking about?  Did you see that?  What?  There's a bunny rabbit.  Wait, is there a bunny rabbit?  Where are you going? 
[00:00:30]  I've got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby.  But enough of this clever.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey!  Hey!  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  That's Drew Boogie live in studio today.  Nice.  Love the Drew Boogie remixes.  Hey!  Hey!  Ha, ha, ha.  Phone number.  I like that scratching thing the kids are doing these days. 
[00:01:30]  Ah!  Can't get my seat down.  Oh, no.  Jimmy's going to have a fine view of my you-know-what today.  Can't get to the seat.  There we go.  All right.  You're, uh...  I've got to hide that goodness from Jimmy.  What, are you wearing a skirt?  I'll look right up there.  Hey, uh, are the Olympics over officially, or are they starting?  Um, yeah, no idea.  Huh?  Oh, two hours, they're, uh, they're starting.  Okay.  Yeah, but it's way over there, so... 
[00:02:00]  Are the Olympics done, and then we'll slowly but surely get the info coming our way in the  coming days and weeks?  Isn't there a ridiculous time difference or day difference or something where...  Like, the opening ceremonies start in two hours?  What time is it over there?  It's got to be...  What?  If it's 8 o'clock here, it's got to be 9, 10 o'clock over there.  I would say that's about right.  Are they going to make us wait till tonight, or can you watch it live?  I think live. 
[00:02:30]  That old gag.  The Olympics, you know, back in the day when there was two, three, uh, TV stations, and,  uh, the Olympics were, were happening in a faraway land, and then all of a sudden they  would make you wait to nighttime because they want the big audience.  Uh-huh.  I understand that, but now with the internet and everything, with technology, it's ridiculous  that they make you wait until tonight to see the opening ceremonies.  Where can you see them live?  I don't think there's a live option on everything.  NBC is mixing it up back and forth. 
[00:03:00]  They'll probably put clips in the Today Show of some of the, uh, opening ceremonies, but  they've got a big production.  They're 12 hours ahead of us based on-  12 hours ahead.  The web clock.  So it's Sunday?  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6,  So it's 8 o'clock at night?  Show your work.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's 6 o'clock, yeah.  I mean, but, but it's going to be 8 o'clock at night when they start the opening ceremonies.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then that would be 8 in the morning, their time.  Our time. 
[00:03:30]  No, our time.  No, but by the time they show them over here, China's already in the next morning.  But if it's our time, stupid China, fix their, they got to fix their air.  Yeah.  What were they saying about their air?  This is, uh, pretty bad.  And they're trying to say, no, there's no problem, everything's cool.  But all the athletes that are going over there, and, um, they spoke with a few American guests that are over there to look at the Olympics, uh, to watch, that the air is horrific over there. 
[00:04:00]  You can look up, and you don't ever see a blue sky when you're in Beijing.  You don't ever see it.  It's just this whitish haze that's, uh, all, it's there all the time.  And, um, you're breathing in.  It looks like it's going to rain at any moment.  Yeah.  All the time.  Yeah.  It looks like it's going to drizzle.  Yeah.  And you're just breathing in this horrible carbon monoxide and, uh, just awful air.  We get crap constantly in this country for being the filthy, dirty Americans that we are ruining the environment. 
[00:04:30]  Meanwhile, they're just a disaster over there.  Yeah.  They're pumping out stuff for us to enjoy, though.  Yeah.  Oh, good stuff.  Yeah.  They make all the stuff that, uh, all the lead toys love.  Yeah.  Lead toys for the kids.  Rubber doggy duty.  I love their rubber dog duty.  No one makes it better than China, by the way.  No.  I've seen some from other countries.  Doesn't compare.  It falls apart, and it just doesn't hold up.  Yeah.  Spilt, the fake spilt beer. 
[00:05:00]  It looks so authentic from China.  They're really making some great products over there.  Great exports.  I'm a big fan of the puke splat.  Yeah.  See?  And you'll only get the best from China.  Yeah.  The proper chunks.  But, Anthony, they-  Meat content.  They say their, uh, air is within standards.  What, what standards?  Within standards.  Within their standards?  Just within standards.  So, they're, they could tell the whole world, no, we got our air quality within standards. 
[00:05:30]  The, the people making the standards are the same people that, uh, took four protesters  that were protesting, um, the treatment of Tibet by China, and, uh, took them away.  And, uh, that was the last I heard of them.  I'm sure they're having their own Olympics right now.  The pain competition.  How much pain can you take?  Ooh, we have a gold medal winner.  Oh, here we go.  Yes.  Ah. 
[00:06:00]  Dun, dun.  Yes.  Every four years.  Well, actually, two, I guess we get to hear this.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  And then I get confused sometimes, depending on where it is.  Is it the summer or the winter Olympics?  I don't know.  You're kidding, right?  Of course it's the summer.  All right.  But sometimes, like, what if they have the, um, summer Olympics in Australia, and it's  winter down there?  Well, they would never do that.  Never, you say?  I don't know.  Wait, didn't Sydney do the, uh, Olympics?  Yeah, which one did they do? 
[00:06:30]  Yes, Sydney hosted.  What did they do?  Anthony brings up a good point.  Was it the summer or winter Olympics?  They were the summer.  But it's winter down there.  So we had the summer Olympics in the winter?  That time around?  Australia's a big country.  It's like doing something in Miami here in, in, uh, you know, the winter.  Oh, in the winter.  Yeah.  Oh.  I believe.  Hmm.  Okay.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough, stunt brain.  I think winter, uh, the, the winter Olympics, way more exciting than the, than the summer  Olympics. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, but, but, uh, summer Olympics, more sexy.  Oh, yeah.  More sexy.  Oh, yeah.  I like watching, uh, gymnastics.  Call me a pervert.  Do you really?  Go ahead, please.  They're a little, they're a little, like, fire hydrants.  No, no, no.  That stupid, uh, what's her face there?  Uh, Mary Lou Rotten.  She was a fire hydrant.  She looks awful.  Most of them are.  But there's the little cutie ones that kind of do the little routine, and then they're  like, eee.  Their legs are way too big. 
[00:07:30]  They're squatty.  Some of them are, uh, alright.  There's not one of them that's over four foot ten.  They look taller on TV.  Yeah, they do.  I'm not gonna see them in real life.  You gotta go with the volleyball, my friend.  Beach volleyball.  Beach volleyball's good.  No, I'll give you that.  You gotta go beach volleyball over, uh, gymnastics.  You don't like watching them do the uneven bars?  A lot of camel toe.  They're too squatty.  No, not all of them.  And whatever they feed these, uh, these broads, they don't have boobs. 
[00:08:00]  Well, no, they gotta, uh, definitely cut down on the boobage because it ruins their act.  They gotta be very, uh, slender.  I would love to know how many athletes, uh, had their careers ruined because their boobies  got too big.  Yeah.  There have been, though.  They've come out.  You ever see some of those girls?  They were really good at, like, 14 years old, and then they try to get it, like, next Olympics,  and they're 18.  Yeah.  And they're just women.  And now they got a giant breast.  Now they gotta drag their D-cups around. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Just getting in the way of everything.  They're just using no hands on the uneven bars, just the bottom of their breasts, holding  on.  They do have, uh, nice, uh, um, little heinies, though.  Well, look at that one.  They're all very, very, uh, muscular.  There's gonna be no complaint there.  The girl is touching her toes.  Yeah, that's a nice position right there.  It's just, they're cool to watch.  A girl on her tippy toes and on her fingertips at the same time.  Yeah.  And the old Olympic uniform is kind of hiking up a bit. 
[00:09:00]  See?  All right.  I'll watch that.  I agree with you, though.  A majority of them are just messes.  Squats.  But occasionally you get a, you know, a good one out there.  Know who I thought was really hot back in the day?  Oh.  Olga Corbett.  Olga Corbett.  Didn't we always used to love our Soviet, uh, our Soviet gymnasts?  Olga Corbett.  And then the other one.  Uh, Nadia.  Nadia Komenich. 
[00:09:30]  Nadia Komenich.  Nadia Komenich.  Yeah.  And now they're just these big, fat Russian mamas with moles all over them.  Give me a picture of Olga Corbett.  Where's old and new?  She looked old when she was young.  I hope people understand that I was just joking.  Because Olga Corbett could be the ugliest athlete ever.  Even, duh, America loved her.  Look at that thing.  That's now, right?  That's Olga Corbett.  What year was she, uh, competing?  Oh, she was back in the early 70s. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, 1972, I would have to say.  72?  I'm going to go with the big, uh, 1972.  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It was?  Yes.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  There's our Olympic coverage.  Olympic coverage.  Yeah.  Live from China.  Live from China.  Starting at 8 o'clock.  Well, we're live from China today.  Yes.  Broadcasting live from the Olympics.  Yep.  Jimmy's got his air mask on because he doesn't want to get any, uh, any dust in his lungs.  What was it?  The bicycling team?  What?  That, uh, had to apologize? 
[00:10:30]  Why did they have to apologize?  Well, they arrived into China.  Yeah.  Wearing those, uh, masks.  Yes.  They didn't want to breathe in the awful, horrible air.  And, uh, they said it, it looked, uh, bad and, uh, wasn't very nice.  Uh, and they had to apologize.  Chinese people on planes here always wear those things.  They're constantly wearing those stupid SARS masks and stuff.  Wait.  But, uh, the locals wear the masks.  I know.  But we're not allowed to.  No.  Why?  I don't know.  It was insulting, they said. 
[00:11:00]  And then, uh, speaking of insulting, George Bush, uh, gave a little speech.  Uh-huh.  And insulted, uh, China and they're very, uh, mad.  How did he insult them?  Well, he said that, uh, you know, he starts bringing in, I love when these guys, Jimmy  Carter used to do this all the time, too.  They start preaching human rights.  Their whole country, their whole government and, and everything is based on the fact that  their people do not have rights.  Their, their, their system would crumble if their people were given rights. 
[00:11:30]  And, uh, George Bush, uh, said that if, uh, the people of China would have their basic  human rights, China would be able to excel to their full potential.  Ah.  And China told George Bush to shut the F up.  Pretty much.  That's a country.  I told you a long time ago, the Chinese are, are coming.  Slowly but surely.  They're one of the few countries left that can really keep a steel fist right down on  their people. 
[00:12:00]  You know, they, uh, they keep them from getting information.  They edit, uh, the internet, which is very difficult to do.  Uh, they, they, protesters, you're gone, gone, beaten with truncheons.  I've been reading about that.  How do you edit the internet for a whole country?  I don't know how they do.  They're brilliant.  Because you got stuff coming in from, uh, other countries.  Yeah.  That's how you get some of that gambling done online and things like that.  You think you're going to real sites, but you're going to like Google. 
[00:12:30]  It's just, uh.  You gotta go to guys' houses.  I heard they have government agents that will go to your house.  Yeah, Jimmy.  And then watch you.  And then whenever you're clicked on the wrong page, they would delete that.  Delete that.  Yes.  That's all they do.  No.  No.  No, not that page.  They have a person at everyone's computer.  And they have to say, okay, or else you're beaten.  Or why?  They do have enough people where they could have one person following you around.  One person for every person.  Yes.  That's what they have.  They just split their country in half.  Okay.  You're going to be the followers. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Of these people over here.  You have to listen to these guys.  And that'll keep everyone in line.  No logging on to that.  They have, just think, a country that knows not the joy of two girls, one cup.  I'm sure they got their own version.  All right.  So we're your exclusive Olympic radio station.  Yeah.  We're broadcasting live from China.  Yes.  We're in Beijing.  And we'll be talking about the Olympics all day today.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Really fast.  Last night, I went to see the, quote, final police show at Madison Square Garden here in New York City. 
[00:13:30]  Madison Square Garden.  A little-known fact about me, I was a huge police fan growing up.  Yeah.  Were you into the police growing up band?  No.  I liked one or two songs, but for the most part, especially the police's early stuff, all right, we get it.  You don't have to say the line 8,000 times.  Yo, yo, yo. 
[00:14:00]  I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing.  I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing.  I can't, I can't, I can't stand.  All right.  You can't stand losing her.  I kind of like the older stuff.  Do you?  Than the Ghost in the Machine type stuff.  Yeah.  I kind of like more of the reggae beat the police used to do back in the day.  Repetitive, I think.  Well, yeah, I mean, it was meant for like, you know, just smoke a little, you know.  Was it?  I thought it was kind of like a new wave. 
[00:14:30]  Ah, they got caught up in being new wave slash punk slash reggae.  Yeah.  They didn't really know what they were.  Yeah.  And then they became a pop band.  Why am I trashing them?  I grew up listening to these guys.  Oh, I know.  I actually loved them.  You're a big fan.  And then they break up in 84, 85, and I was telling my girl last night at the garden, I was saying, this is really weird because when I was growing up, it was U2 and the police for me after I discovered Zeppelin and, you know, whatever.  And I'm telling her, I'm like, U2 still doing it. 
[00:15:00]  The police haven't had a new album out in 20 some odd years, 24 years, something like that.  And U2's working on another new album, and they will be touring the world with that new album, and their arenas will be filled with young, young people.  And the police just stopped creating back in 84, and these two bands were relatively equal when they both came out.  And they were competing against each other for the most part.  They were big audiences. 
[00:15:30]  They opened up with, Jimmy, Sunshine of Your Love by Cream.  Odd song to open with.  Well, it was their last show ever, supposedly.  I don't believe that.  I think they'll take a year or two off, and they might do another one, kind of do the kiss thing, just come out of retirement every few years.  And, yeah, they came out and just jammed Sunshine of Your Love.  They were having a really good time.  And then they had the police, what are they called, the drum what, Ant?  The drum line?  NYPD Drum Corps. 
[00:16:00]  Drum and something?  Yeah, the marching band from the NYPD was there, weren't they?  Yeah, they lined up on stage, and they helped the police with Message in a Bottle, which was awesome.  But I was sitting in the garden with a bunch of nerds.  Nerds?  Yeah, because their last show was for public TV.  And there was a fine couple right behind me, sleeping through the entire B-52 set,  and were the only two people not standing for the entire police show last night at Madison Square Garden. 
[00:16:30]  And I'm sitting there thinking, these people were just calling a phone number on public TV to get tickets.  Yeah.  Donation, you get a ticket to this big show last night.  So there are a lot of nerds.  A lot of people with IQs way higher than mine.  Nerds.  Way higher.  How about the B-52s?  Well, I was telling Anthony, how clueless was I growing up that I had no idea that this Fred Schneider,  the lead singer of the B-52s, was gay?  How naive was I growing up on Long Island that I had no effing clue that this guy was gay? 
[00:17:00]  The most naive person ever, ever?  Because, wow.  Yeah.  That could be the gayest individual ever.  They were great, by the way.  But the B-52s, every time he talked, I was just amazed at how gay his voice was.  Can you see that?  Gee.  I had no idea what he was saying, because I'm like, how could you?  I don't think you could sound gayer.  What the rock, rock, shot.  Ah. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Rock, rock, shot.  The monsterness.  Monster Mash.  You know this song, right, Jimmy?  All right.  And his two female companions there, one was in a corset trying to hold all her fatness in.  And the B-52s, they like to kind of dance and do their thing.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Kate Pearson.  Kate Pearson was in a corset holding her fatness in, and she couldn't really, like, bend. 
[00:18:00]  Which one was she, the blonde or the redhead?  The redhead with the big beehive thing, but she doesn't do the big beehive thing anymore.  Oh, she doesn't do the beehive anymore?  She gives you a little beehive in the back, just a little bit to say, yeah, I know, I  used to do the beehive thing.  A little tribute to the beehive.  And then the blonde, who looked like she was wearing a wig and looked like she was on  some pretty serious stuff last night.  Cindy?  Cindy what?  Cindy Wilson.  Cindy Wilson.  She decided it was a good idea not to have a bra.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  It was an amazing show last night.  What are some other songs they do?  I don't even know that one.  B-52s?  Yeah.  You got the Love Shack.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  This was a huge hit.  Aw.  You don't like these, Jimmy?  Promise you want to do.  No?  It's not terrible.  It's feel-good music, Jimmy.  Right.  It's just playing, and you're just like, la.  It's la-la music.  You know Love Shack, right?  Yeah.  Love Shack, baby. 
[00:19:00]  Stinks.  I can't hear you.  At the side of the road that says 15 miles to the-  Is this that big closing number?  Huh?  Did everybody really clap along?  Oh, yeah.  The nerds were dancing last night.  We were making fun of all the nerds.  Nerds?  Just dancing.  Bunch of moms just trying to relive their youth last night at the garden.  Their youth.  Their youth.  It's an awful song this is.  The police couldn't have brought a better band than this? 
[00:19:30]  Well, it goes with the era, man.  Kind of popular with the people.  I bet it fit, right?  It was fine.  Yeah.  I saw the police back in the day with Black Uhuru.  This reggae band that hates Whitey.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Did they hate Whitey back in the day.  Isn't that just a reggae band?  Oh, yeah.  A major reggae band.  You could have just said a reggae band.  Yeah, I know.  It was at the Syracuse Dome or whatever, and there had to be 40 or 50 members on stage 
[00:20:00]  of this band before the police.  Sure.  Just doing their reggae thing.  I want to know what other songs they played last night, because I was responsible, and  I got out of there kind of early.  The set list isn't up yet.  All right.  Well, you did.  You didn't stay for their encore?  I would love to.  I'm sure the encore was something very popular.  I would have loved to.  It was the last show ever.  Roxanne?  It was the last show ever, but I felt like I needed to get a little sleep.  It's our last show.  For the radio show.  Yeah.  I bet Roxanne was their...  Roxanne? 
[00:20:30]  I think they did Purple Haze, I heard.  Hey, how about some police songs?  I think you had a few hits.  They did.  They did all their hits.  Did they?  And then they left the stage with...  It was kind of hacky.  I wasn't there, obviously, but Looney Tunes, a little That's All, Folks.  Because, you know, that's all for the police.  What was the last song you heard?  I don't even remember now.  Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic wrapped around your finger.  I was there for that.  Da-do-do-do-da-da-da-da.  I did the do-do-do with the band, yes. 
[00:21:00]  Invisible Son.  Invisible Son, which is a great police song.  Can't Stand Losing You.  I was there for the whole can't, can't, can't, like Anthony said.  Roxanne, King of Pain.  Oh, I missed King of...  I missed King of Pain?  The first encore from the PNC set was Roxanne, King of Pain, So Lonely, and Every Breath,  and then they did Next to You.  Nice.  So that was the PNC, but we'll see if it's different.  All right.  We're just getting started.  We got Drew Boogie in the house today.  You want to do a little scratching in to break there, Drew? 
[00:21:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Listen to Drew Boogie for a minute here.  Really?  Yeah, look at this thing.  Really?  It's...  It's ridiculous.  It's ridi...  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:22:00]  You've got a whore face. 
[00:22:30]  That's a whore face.  That's a whore face.  That's a whore face.  Whore face.  That's a whore face.  Right on.  Drew Boogie helping us out today.  It's The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I just saw something really disgusting on TV. 
[00:23:00]  What's that?  It bugs me.  But it's something we've talked about, and I guess it is happening in front of our eyes.  They just had a commercial for Boston playing August 12th, I think, at Jones Beach here in the New York City area.  Really? The band Boston?  I'm like, how are they getting that done without Brad Delp?  The great Brad Delp.  Yeah, he would be unavailable to sing with Boston, being that he's dead. 
[00:23:30]  And he was the lead singer of Boston.  With quite a unique voice.  I know Mr. Schultz was the genius behind the band, but Brad Delp was the vocalist.  Yeah, and he had a very high voice. He had a very good range. Very hard to replace.  How the F do you go on tour without Brad Delp and call yourself Boston?  He's actually playing here. He had to fulfill the contractual obligation.  Like, listen how high that voice is. 
[00:24:00]  Very hard to do that.  You don't see many people doing Boston on karaoke.  No.  It's a tough note to hit, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Brad Delp, it's been a while now, but he kind of rolled a barbecue into his bedroom.  Yep.  Lit it up.  He was such a nice guy. He had signs all over the house warning people not to go into 
[00:24:30]  the bedroom because he didn't want others to die along with him.  Sure.  Oh, boy, did he, Jimmy.  Lit a barbecue grill in his room, shut the doors and windows and stuff, and just lay there  until, you know, the carbon monoxide got to him.  I didn't like to kill himself. Why?  I didn't think you could kill yourself with a barbecue.  Well, there you can.  I thought you could do that just to get a nice, summery smell into your house.  Into your house. 
[00:25:00]  A lot of people do that during the winter when they bring their little hibachis in and  don't realize, oops, first of all, it gives off carbon monoxide.  Secondly, you're burning up the oxygen in the room.  Yeah.  Wait, what, why did he kill himself? Does anybody know?  He was depressed.  Was it over the band?  I don't really remember anymore.  I know he was depressed.  He was such a nice guy.  We were lucky enough to meet him back in the day when we were doing radio in Boston.  Really, really, really nice, down-to-earth guy.  What? 
[00:25:30]  How long does that take to work if you put a hibachi on?  What would it do?  Well, it probably would take a few.  Take a while, but, yeah, hell, if you're asleep.  Yeah, if you're tired, you know.  Depends on the size of the room, I would gather.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, sir.  If you're tired, I mean, it's got to be very difficult to fall asleep knowing if you do.  That's it.  It's amazing.  That could have been a sleeper.  Yeah, that's a good sleeper, all right.  Well, at least he died doing what he loved, barbecuing.  So, yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Big barbecuer, was he? 
[00:26:00]  I love when they say that.  Well, at least he died doing what he loved.  Someone is saying the singer from Striper is now the lead singer of Boston.  Oh, yeah?  Why doesn't he do the Striper thing in Boston?  Just go do something else.  That's awful.  They want money, Boston.  But people will go and see them.  Boston?  Yeah.  With who, though?  They had to get a singer.  I guess they got him.  I just told you.  The lead singer, Striper, is now the lead singer of Boston. 
[00:26:30]  Wasn't that that religious band?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I think the guy from Boston was depressed.  They put out one album every 18 years.  Yeah, because of Schultz.  That was always a big pain in the ass.  When's the next Boston album coming out?  He was legendary for being just a perfectionist to the point where people didn't like him.  Who was that?  Schultz.  Who was Schultz?  He was the mastermind behind Boston.  I thought he was the bumbling sergeant at Stalick 13.  He was like a mad scientist. 
[00:27:00]  He created the whole Boston sound in his basement, basically.  So was he the songwriter?  And Brad Delp had to just kind of sit around waiting and waiting and waiting.  And finally, he goes, here you go, Brad.  This is what we need from you.  Those were the times he honed his barbecuing skills.  Yeah.  I do believe.  But that's just disgusting.  But we've said it.  I think these bands are going to just become companies, entities.  And they're just going to continue on after every single original member is dead.  And no one's going to know the difference. 
[00:27:30]  And Gene Simmons was sort of talking about that very thing last time he was on our show.  That he wants to franchise the band and have a bunch of different KISS bands that just tour the world.  And he sits back and just collects the money.  It's going to happen with these guys.  So how many albums did Boston have?  I'm obsessed now.  Two.  There wasn't only two?  Actually, three.  And then they probably had like a greatest hits and a live album and all that crap.  Actually, I think they had four. 
[00:28:00]  I think they did attempt a fourth studio album that no one paid attention to.  Hence, the death of Brad Delp, I think.  What was their big deal?  I mean, they had more than a feeling, those songs.  Did they have anything about the second or third album that anybody knows?  Oh, yeah.  The first album was beyond amazing.  The second album was almost amazing.  The third album was mediocre.  The fourth album, no one bought.  That's the summary of the band Boston right there.  The end.  Light the charcoals.  Boston was one of those rare bands that every song on their debut album was just awesome. 
[00:28:30]  You didn't skip one song off that first album.  What else was it?  It was more than a feeling?  Don't Look Back.  Don't Look Back.  Four Play Long Time.  Hits a Ride.  I don't know any of those songs.  Oh, my God.  Pick up the first Boston album, Jimmy.  I think you would like it.  I had it when I was a boy.  I used to think I was an artist, and kids would pay me a quarter to draw things.  And I drew the Boston album cover for my friend Kenny.  You did?  Seriously?  Yeah.  I thought I was a very good artist.  Can you do it now?  No, because it looked like a retarded spaceship. 
[00:29:00]  It was kind of like...  The fire was coming out slightly wrong.  It wasn't very good.  Hey, Brett Favre.  Why wasn't he playing yesterday?  Come on.  Suit up.  What happened?  Preseason football is upon us, and Brett Favre is on the sidelines in a Jets shirt.  Why isn't he in the game?  He's now a Jet.  Let's go.  Get in there.  Put on the pads.  Let's go.  Can you imagine that's what the Jets organization did?  All right.  You're a Jet now.  Get out there. 
[00:29:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But I don't know any of the plays.  I could get injured.  I haven't thrown a ball in a few months.  I'm a little chubby.  I have to hit the gym and do some cardio first.  Brett Favre.  I'm not really buying into the hype because it doesn't sound like Brett Favre is buying into the hype.  It doesn't sound like he's too thrilled to be a New York Jet.  It really doesn't.  I think everyone else is thrilled.  I mean, his jersey is already sold out.  There's a lot of excitement. 
[00:30:00]  But I think Brett Favre was hoping to either, A, be a Green Bay Packer and finish his career there.  Or, B, go to another team.  Yeah.  I don't think he really wanted to be a Jet.  Here's the excitement of Brett Favre.  Did I ever think this scenario would present itself?  No.  Am I excited about the opportunity?  Yes, I am.  You know, I've had a great career in Green Bay.  It goes without saying, the things that have happened there this past...  I hate to interrupt the Brett Favre press conference, but we got some wrong info. 
[00:30:30]  The new lead singer of Boston is not the old singer from Striper.  No?  And a lot of people are very mad at the misinformation we got.  And you're not going to believe where they got their new lead singer from.  Hey, Check, what's up?  Hey, guys.  The new lead singer of Boston came from the Home Depot.  I guess the guitarist had seen this guy's YouTube video of him singing a Boston song  and thought that it was the lead singer. 
[00:31:00]  That's how good he sounded.  So they flew him up to Boston, and he tried him out, and he hired him on the spot.  But it's just some douche that worked at a Home Depot.  How funny is that?  YouTube.  Next thing you know, you're at the Garden.  Well, what's his name?  We got to get some audio.  I want to hear an example of what he sounds like.  Yeah, absolutely.  There is a guy from Striper who is playing guitar and doing some vocal work, Michael Sweet.  So I don't know if he's the lead singer, but they did pick up a Striper guy.  Well, they like to harmonize a little bit.  I mean, Brad Delp, I think his voice was like, I don't know, they dubbed it like, I don't 
[00:31:30]  know, a million times in those Boston songs.  Yeah, yeah, they did overdubbing.  Overdubbing, sure.  How did he sound live?  Huh?  Did he sound good live?  I never saw Boston live.  Was he terrible?  When we saw him, when he was doing a Beatles cover band thing, he was amazing.  I'm like the boy with a million questions today.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to Brett Favre at the press conference.  It goes without saying, the things that have happened there this offseason, the last few  days, in my opinion, are over and done with. 
[00:32:00]  I wish him well.  I'm a little bit out of shape compared to all the other guys, but I'm so excited about  this opportunity.  Goodness gracious!  Yeah, there's no goodness.  There's Brett Favre!  At 39 years old, you shouldn't ever be a little out of shape if you're thinking about coming  back to the NFL.  Yeah, you're not going to snap back like you're in your 20s.  No.  And in Green Bay, a lot of the hardcore football fans, they put their Packers flags at half 
[00:32:30]  mass.  Oh, really?  When it was official that Brett Favre was no longer a Packer.  Yeah.  Is that the gentleman that is now singing for Boston?  Tommy DiCarlo is the lead singer.  His MySpace page got him the gig.  Wow.  He looks like an O&A listener.  Yeah.  I think an O&A listener is the new lead singer of Boston.  Where did you come from?  That was not a compliment.  I'm sorry. 
[00:33:00]  I really am sorry, but I think we saw about 5,000 Tommy DiCarlo's this past Saturday at  the PNC Bank Art Center.  He's got stage presence.  Look at him.  He's just a fat guy pointing out at the crowd.  He looks like the guy that comes out and tests the microphone before the real guy comes  out.  He's doing an announcement and pointing to somebody to stop the horseplay.  Tommy DiCarlo.  All right.  We've got to see if he sounds anything like Brad Delp. 
[00:33:30]  He sure doesn't look like Brad Delp.  He looks like he might have ate the corpse of Brad Delp.  Was Brad Delp slender?  I don't even remember what he looked like.  He wasn't in the old days.  Probably eating all that healthy barbecue.  Yes.  So he grills everything.  Here's more Brett Favre.  I'm not a traitor.  Never will be.  It's a football game.  You dealt with business.  You were traded.  I gave everything I possibly could give while I was there.  And I hope that the Jets fans see the same thing. 
[00:34:00]  How about this?  You're a guy who throws a ball for a living.  No one thinks you're a traitor to other guys who catch it.  It's just that he was there for so long that it's this big thing that he's not there  anymore.  And he's trying to keep the loyalty of the people of Green Bay, which, you know, just  whatever it is.  We know how this is going to end.  It's simple.  He's going to have an average to mediocre season for the Jets, then another average to  mediocre season with the Jets, and then he's going to officially retire. 
[00:34:30]  I think he might get two seasons in.  And then he's going to make believe he never played for the Jets.  He's going to go back to Green Bay as a hero, and they're going to retire his jersey,  and he's going to be in the Hall of Fame as a Green Bay Packer.  How funny would it be if he went in as a Jet, and he played six games?  Right.  After going, what, like eight and 24 in the next two seasons?  And then only talks about the Jets at the time and at the Hall of Fame, and what the  Jets meant to him.  Right. 
[00:35:00]  That would be very funny.  Let's say hi to Phil in Florida.  Phil, how are you, buddy?  Oh, pretty good.  How are you?  Good.  I was wondering if any of the Drew Boogie material is available.  I'd like to do that retarded song as like a ringtone or something.  I heard rumors that Drew Boogie might finally try to get something out there.  You did?  Yeah, I've heard some things.  Oh, okay.  Will you get this stuff out there for the people?  I am working on it. 
[00:35:30]  You've been working, we've known you for eight years.  You've been working on it.  I just started working on it two months ago.  You're not shiftless, but you are lazy.  Yeah, a little bit.  How come you don't, uh, you could be making money off this.  How come you don't get it together, Drew?  Because I work nine hours a day.  It's a little hard to do it in the off hours.  So I can only do it on the weekends, but I am working on it.  And some things are holding me back, but I am going to get it out there.  Like what?  Uh, me, you, and Anthony?  Yeah.  Besides the garbage material you're given to work with. 
[00:36:00]  He kind of wants us to maybe record a few things.  Oh, yeah, I got to make a phone call for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Sure.  Yeah.  But it's going to get out there.  Everybody at me on the great Drew Boogie on MySpace, and you'll get the bulletin when everything's all ready to go.  See, and he didn't care.  No, he just hung up in the middle of, uh, the answer.  Click.  The answer of the question he asked, he decided he couldn't stick around for the answer.  Story of my life.  Drew Boogie, it's, uh, D-R-U.  Right.  B-O-O-G-I-E. 
[00:36:30]  All right, phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Are we getting some, uh, Tommy DiCarlo?  Yeah, they're pulling it.  I have a, I did find a clip of Tommy DiCarlo and Mr. Sweet that we'll put on onaradio.com,  but they're pulling some clean audio in the back.  Hmm.  Ah, it's just sacrilege, though, when a band does that.  I had to hear it.  Yeah, he was like, you know, I mean, who else was there in Boston?  Do you remember?  Brad Delp, and then, um, ah, the other guys with the afros.  No, it was Schultz. 
[00:37:00]  He was the genius behind the band.  No, I mean, I mean, in the band, though.  Oh, then you had Sid, uh, we met him, too.  He was, he loved his, uh, his, his party.  Oh, wait, Schultz wasn't even in the band?  Yeah, he was.  Wasn't he?  Well, what'd he do?  He did, he basically did everything.  Oh.  Brad Delp was, uh, you know, just sang, sang, uh, the tunes.  But I don't think, I don't think Brad Delp wrote anything for the most part.  Really?  I don't think so.  That's how I have it.  I have no idea.  I just know that, uh, Brad Delp, uh, had a good voice. 
[00:37:30]  They overdubbed the hell out of him.  He, like, did all the harmonies.  So, live, who knows?  But, um, well, I can't wait to see this, uh, Home Depot kid.  He doesn't look like a kid, though.  No.  All right.  Looks like a fat Long Island slob with a mullet.  Wait, that, which one's him?  I don't know.  There he is to the right.  The long hair or the short hair, Iraq?  Short hair, yeah.  He's...  He's like Doug Benson, the comedian.  Yeah, a little bit.  That's, that's a good call, Jimmy. 
[00:38:00]  All right, uh, we, we got a good show today, man.  We got Bob Saget calling in to promote the roast that Jimmy flew out to do.  Yes, sir.  We got, uh, Shane O'Mac from the WWE stopping by today.  Well, now, isn't that to judge, uh, Sam's, uh, contest?  Yes.  Sam's.  I certainly hope more people, uh, sent in entries to Sam's little contest, or it's going  to be very embarrassing.  He's got at least ten or so.  Oh, does he now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, people stepped up.  That's good. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, and, uh, also, the great Jim Brewer.  Will be on our radio show for the first time in six years today.  My infant return.  Yeah, he's playing comics this weekend here in New York City.  Donna in New York.  What's up?  Hey, I saw Boston last weekend.  And?  Yeah, and I'm a musician, and, um, I was, uh, I was pretty impressed.  You know, I didn't expect, kept yelling out, I miss Brad, where's Brad?  I kept yelling it out, but it's pretty decent.  I can't...  Wait, why would you...  Could you tell me what, what part of Long Island you're from? 
[00:39:00]  No, I'm from Rockland County.  Wait, you were yelling, where's Brad?  Yeah.  What are you, stupid?  He's dead.  Why would you yell, where's Brad?  He's dead.  I know he's dead.  I'm just, I was being, you know...  Funny.  You know, they're, they should start making rules for rock and roll.  I think if your lead singer dies, and he was so, so notably the voice of the band, and  he passes on, and you decide to get, like, a lead singer from Home Depot, you should charge 
[00:39:30]  karaoke prices.  Karaoke prices if you want a tour.  Seriously.  Because it's a karaoke band now.  It's a cover band.  Yeah.  Or cover band.  It's a cover band.  Right.  Cover band prices.  What does a, what does a Boston cover band get these days?  Maybe $5 at the door?  $7 at the door?  I videotaped some stuff.  I'll send it over to you guys.  All right.  All right, Donna.  Thank you.  She's yelling, where's Brad?  Jesus.  You're the fan that everybody hates.  Where's Brad? 
[00:40:00]  People turn around and go, he's dead, you dummy.  Yeah.  It's in a box.  He chose to, he chose to make chicken cutlets next to his bed, and he fell asleep, and that's  it.  Brad went out like a London broil.  Hey.  He died doing what he loved dying.  He loved dying.  Good old RPI came up with something.  Remember we were talking to Buzz Aldrin about a week ago?  Yep.  That great astronaut that walked on the moon?  He was second to walk on the moon? 
[00:40:30]  We noticed that he was clearing his throat a lot.  Yeah.  And so did RPI, and he came up with this.  Now, all the way live from New York City.  Buzz Aldrin, everyone.  Well, I got a chance here.  Let me clear my door.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[00:41:00]  He didn't clear his stupid throat a lot, did he?  Oh, it was ridiculous.  It's some moon dust still in there, I guess.  Pardon?  We want to yell, all right, all righty, get some water. 
[00:41:30]  Two Boogie in studio.  Take us out for a little bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.  Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
[00:42:00]  Joy, joy.  Joy, joy.  Joy. 
[00:42:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, put it together for Spud's.  I hate you, too. 
[00:43:00]  A Spud's Buckley remix.  Yeah.  I hate that Spud's Buckley.  No, he's trying to make it buck.  No, he stinks.  Bring Spud's back.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Spud's rules.  Wow.  That was good, Drew.  Kind of like Boston, though, we did want to recast the Spud's Buckley character on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what happened?  Because the original Spud's Buckley died tragically in 19, I think it was like 98, somewhere around there. 
[00:43:30]  Barbecue in the bedroom.  Yeah, and he was a big part of the Opie and Anthony show, and we need to recast the Spud's Buckley character.  Do we?  I think some of the guys were going to give it a try around here, and then we dropped the bith.  Yeah.  And we should have dropped the bith.  877-212-0NA.  By the way, I got a Travis who wrote the sheet.  His name is not Tank Kankerous, you dumbbell.  It's Tank Hankerous.  Tank Hankerous.  With an H.  Tank Hankerous.  Tank Hankerous is a Greek.  What do you got?  We have a new shirt for Tank. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, Tank.  Why don't you put your shirt on for everybody?  What are you doing, Tank?  You don't have a tank top on.  Yeah, exactly.  What does the shirt say, Tank?  I can't read it.  That's E-Rock.  I want to talk to Tank.  The shirt says, here comes the S-Show.  That's great.  So fitting.  Yeah, as he puts on his tank top.  Instant feedback.  Sonny Farrelly from Boston writes, he's really good.  Don't knock this guy to you. 
[00:44:30]  Listen to him, and then you can make your decision.  Of course, the new lead singer of Boston, now that Brad Delp has passed on, is Tommy DiCarlo,  who used to work at a Home Depot.  And then they got another guy in there, though.  So how do you get two people to replace Brad Delp?  Well, you've got to harmonize.  Yeah, true.  I think when Boston went on tour, Brad Delp actually sang over his own voice.  Yeah, I think they tracked it.  Because they did a little of that overdubbing.  And then you've got John Fox from Brooklyn.  He writes, there are four karaoke bands out on tour right now this summer. 
[00:45:00]  You've got Boston without Brad Delp.  You've got Styx without Dennis DeYoung.  You've got Foreigner without Lou Graham.  And you've got Journey without Steve Perry.  Yeah.  And people are going to these shows.  Like it's the real band.  These shows are doing really well without the lead singers.  That made them famous.  People love nostalgia.  Styx, at least Tommy Shaw sang.  Is he still in the band?  Yeah, of course he is.  Because he sang some of the stuff, too.  He was a great guitarist.  He's there until the damn Yankees get together.  And then he goes, screw sticks. 
[00:45:30]  Here's a little taste of Tommy DiCarlo as the new lead singer of Boston.  He's in the knees and arms. 
[00:46:00]  He's still in the band like me.  Hey, you know what?  Sounds pretty good.  Hey, the guy sounds pretty good.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You think he's on the new shirts?  Like they just have a Boston logo with a guy on a forklift backing up.  Getting lumber for somebody.  Holding a propane tank on the shirt.  Where are the ceiling fans, Fatty?  What's that?  That is one of his professional photos.  Oh, it looks good.  Oh, God. 
[00:46:30]  Yuck.  There's a photo of him.  And he's got like a little keyboard.  It looks like it's floating next to him.  And his right hand is in tink-a-link-a-link position.  Tink-a-link-a-link.  Yeah, it looks like a glamour shot.  That is awful.  Well, you know, got to give it to him.  I'm getting some more info from Stump Brain.  Journey's lead singer is a Filipino guy.  Really?  Yeah, named Arnell Panetta?  Something like that?  I heard he sounds just like Steve Perry.  I want to hear some of him.  But you know what?  I want to see Steve Perry. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Why isn't Steve Perry going out with them?  Or why isn't Dennis DeYoung with, they just hate their old bandmates?  After a while, you just can't stand the people you work with.  Yep.  But what else are you doing, though?  Let's say hi to Mike.  What else is he doing?  Mike?  I don't know.  Where's Dennis DeYoung?  Dennis DeYoung?  I think Dennis DeYoung was allergic to light or something.  I saw one of those dumb freaking VH1 shows.  Oh, was he really?  And he had a problem with light.  And he was doing Broadway shows.  He was doing like the music of Broadway as a one-man show in little cabaret theaters. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, okay.  But look it up.  Gay?  Look it up, though.  I think he has some kind of allergic reaction to light, and it prevented him from traveling.  I don't know.  Well, didn't he want to do...  He's a freak.  He's a weirdo.  He wanted to do the stage act where you had to...  He wanted to do the stage play of Mr. Roboto.  Well, that's genius.  He acted all out, and you guys were like, this stinks.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Mike, who works at WBCN in Boston.  He wants in on this conversation.  What's up, Mike? 
[00:48:00]  Not much.  How's it going?  Good, bro.  Yeah, Tom Schultz, he was pretty much the mastermind behind Boston.  Yep.  He was the one that came up with that whole falsetto chorus stuff.  Okay.  Oh, yeah?  He felt it, yeah.  And so I guess during the years, though, after his creative differences and stuff, and  they eventually fell apart, and after Adele died, his wife actually blamed Schultz for  some of his depression for causing all that crap.  Why?  I have no idea.  I guess they just had a big falling out, and Tom was giving them crap and just led to 
[00:48:30]  one thing to another.  Yeah, they didn't talk to each other at the end of Brad Delp's life.  Nope.  That was pretty much it.  Yeah.  And now you've got Home Depot guy, and he's sounding pretty good.  Yeah, I haven't heard him yet, so I have no idea.  Yeah, we just gave him a little listen.  Kind of sounds like him.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks for the info.  Let's say hi to Will the Trucker.  Will.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I was just wanting to find out who replaced Tony DiCarlo at the Home Depot.  Now that's the big question. 
[00:49:00]  Who replaced him?  There's just some dude at Home Depot.  You know what?  I replaced Tommy DiCarlo.  That's right.  Who's Tommy DiCarlo?  Well, he's the lead singer of Boston.  And I filled his position here at the Home Depot.  And I'm stacking sheetrock.  Yeah.  How big are the gigs they're doing?  They're 5,000 seats?  I was mistaken.  I said, Jones Beach, they're playing PNC.  You know, we just played PNC, and I'm sure they'll get, you know, 10, 12, 14,000 people there. 
[00:49:30]  Easy.  Sure.  They'll package them together.  They'll do 15,000.  Do a couple of bands together?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I appreciate it, brother.  All right.  And I'm getting more info on Lou Graham.  Lou Graham played a lobster festival up there in Maine.  Ooh.  So his old bandmates are touring as Foreigner, and Lou Graham is playing Lobster Fest.  Oh, God.  What the hell happened to our youth?  Why is he just go out with a band?  What, do they rape each other on the road?  How bad could it be?  They do have some hatred, some of these guys, where they could never, ever play with each 
[00:50:00]  other again.  The guy falls asleep in his bewakes and his bandmates on his chest.  He's got it out.  How bad could it be on the road?  I don't know.  You're doing a lobster fest in Maine.  Let's say hi to Eric in Indiana.  Eric.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I heard Allison Change is doing that cover band thing, and you can't replace Lane  Staley.  I hear they sound really good, too, but Lane Staley was just a special performer.  Isn't the singer a black guy, too?  He's a black guy that sounds a lot like Lane, but that's another band that could pull it off 
[00:50:30]  because you could harmonize.  So you don't really need the guy to sound exactly like Lane, because you could cover  up a lot of stuff with some harmonization.  That's hard, though.  Lane had a very distinct voice.  We were talking to someone recently, and they said the new Allison Change stuff is really,  really good.  There's a song on there that's going to blow everyone away.  I forgot who was telling us that, but...  I want to know who replaced Stephen Carr in Foundry.  Who'd they get there?  Here we go.  Yeah, the tour.  Yeah.  Get out of my way. 
[00:51:00]  My way.  The other way.  I think Corky, after he left Life Goes On.  Corky.  Sang a little bit.  What big queen replaced him?  Charles Nelson, Paul Wynn.  Get out of my way.  Ha ha ha ha!  Let's say hi to somebody in Jersey. 
[00:51:30]  Somebody in Jersey, how are you today?  All right, good, guys.  How are you doing?  They didn't have your name on the screen.  I don't know who you are.  I saw Allison Change last year at the Borgata, and the guy, not only is he a black guy, he's  this tall, skinny black guy with a huge apple, looks like Shaft.  Doesn't look the part at all, but he was great.  But he was great, huh?  I just have a problem seeing these bands after the lead singer either dies or moves on.  Except for ACDC with this Brian Johnson.  He filled the shoes quite well and had a lot of huge hits after when he became the singer. 
[00:52:00]  Well, Bon Scott died, but he didn't just do a bunch of Bon Scott coverage.  He did new material.  He replaced a lead singer, and it's a whole new era of the band that's different.  These guys are just going out like...  Plus, ACDC was a lot younger then.  It was almost like the...  Well, they were more successful with Brian Johnson.  Yeah, they were able to play some right new songs, so it was, you know...  And have huge hits.  But when you're just going out like after the band has seen 20 years, and then the guy is singing...  They have established songs, and that's the only thing people want to hear. 
[00:52:30]  To do an impression of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's say...  It is an impression.  They're not throwing their own twist on it.  They're trying to sound exactly like the singer did.  Because that's what the audience wants.  Chappie, Boston, listening on BCN.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey there, Chappie.  Hey, T and I were talking about the Filipino singer from Journey.  And apparently the guy doesn't speak English.  Like, she just gets out there and sings.  Somebody else has done the announcements.  Hey, this is the song I'm going to sing.  And the guy just starts belting the shit out and stuff out.  Sorry about that.  That's okay. 
[00:53:00]  Ah, that is...  That's pretty funny.  No English, huh?  Is that true?  I don't think it's not true.  It's not true?  No.  It's not true.  He does.  I like to think it's true.  It's not true.  And the new lead singer of Journey is Filipino, and he doesn't speak English, but he knows  how to sing in English.  He's got a really thick Filipino accent, but when he sings, he sounds identical to Steve  Perry.  They're called an audio.  Steve, who replaced you in Foundry?  Steve who?  Other morbidly obese homosexual who shops for clothing at Lane Bryant.  Thank you very much.  Lane Bryant.  You did shop at Lane Bryant. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get a Bryant in Jersey.  Wait, were you the original singer, or did you replace someone?  No, it was me.  I was the original one.  You know what?  I replaced Harvey Fierstein.  Get out of my way.  Duff McKagan told us that the new Alice in Chains song is really, really good.  Thank you for that blowing fouls from Cleveland.  E-Rock is working on a Foundry remix. 
[00:54:00]  It's not done yet, but he wants to play a little sample for us to prove that every song  from Foundry sounded exactly the same.  Oh, did it?  I think they're all the same tempo, yeah.  All right, here we go.  E-Rock's got a little montage.  A little montage?  A Foundry song.  Okay.  All that's left to be scattered.  Drive to hide.  The pain I feel is tired.  And now I feel.  It's real.  And cannot be fulfilled.  So you will hear.  A tear.  And I just know what you will hear.  Then you might just see what killed me. 
[00:54:30]  My fucking tear.  It's a new song.  Yeah.  It's the hit.  This is a new song, too.  Oh, God, that's not.  That's the same song, dude.  Is it?  Hold on.  E-Rock's arguing.  E-Rock?  That's the guitar solo from Pendulum.  And there's another guitar solo.  I forgot to write down the third song, but it's mixed together.  Oh, wow.  It's exactly the same.  Oh, is that all you have so far? 
[00:55:00]  Both guitar solos?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Wait, this needs a setup because it's so damn good.  How are we going to cue the people?  Hit the bell when it's a new song.  Okay.  This whole thing sounds like one song, but E-Rock put three songs together.  Three songs together.  Profoundry.  Start over.  Okay, here's the first song.  When you hear the bell, that'll be the second song kicking in.  Scattered, dry, too high.  The pain I feel is not at all.  Now I feel, it's real.  And cannot be concealed, so you will hear.  A tear is not as good as you will hear. 
[00:55:30]  Then you might just see what kills me.  My fucking fear, man.  That's what I'm getting going.  The change we use for something that I just can't control.  You see the girl who's going to get out of my way.  The band's a lover swinging back the other way.  I love Pendulum.  I love that song, Pendulum.  That's a super mix.  Almost every song starts and ends the same with a... 
[00:56:00]  And then a long guitar right at the end.  Fantastic.  If we didn't tell the people, you would think that's one song.  That was three songs.  One long act of auditory rape.  Dude, let E-Rock mix your songs.  You might have a hit if you put the whole album together.  You got one good song.  Get the band back together.  Here's the...  Go to a Lowe's maybe and get a singer that can replace you.  Okay.  Here's a true value hardware. 
[00:56:30]  Yes, I'm going to Ace to look for a replacement.  Ace is the place to get a lead singer.  Yes, and we're doing a song called Tough Actin' Ten Actin'.  Hey, Athlete Sports, get out of my way.  I like Pendulum.  It's a good song.  We're going to go backwards now.  You want to hear the Filipino sound like Steve Perry?  Oh, please. 
[00:57:00]  All right, here we go.  This is not Steve Perry.  It's just a small town girl  Living in a lonely world  It's a midnight train of anywhere  Holy jeez  It's just a city boy  For the reasons I'm to try  It's a midnight train of anywhere 
[00:57:30]  That's ridiculous  Good out of my way  No?  They also re-recorded all of their greatest hits  and put it out as a double CD  So the first CD is the greatest hits album  with the Filipino band  With the new singer  Wow  That's some good marketing  Whoa, that's ballsy  And then a second disc of all originals  with him singing as well  I don't know how that works  if there's an advantage to that  He re-did certain songs? 
[00:58:00]  Re-did all the greatest hits  All the hits  It's a great  Steve Perry doesn't get anything  Steve Perry, I guess, doesn't get performance royalties  on the new CD  Oh, wow  I'm assuming that's what  Unless he gets writer's royalties  Oh, my God  Steve Perry was another one they had on that VH1 stuff  and he looked like he was way full of himself  Yeah, they don't get along at all  Did you find out about Dennis DeYoung and this light thing?  I haven't found it yet  Steve, it sounds like you're getting back together  Yes  I would love it  Because I think we'd make  That's the question  No money  You know how much people would want to hear you sing Pendulum? 
[00:58:30]  Not at all  Oh, my God  Now?  The song's now a hit  There's a resurgence  Did he do Pendulum Unplugged?  Just doing a guitar  Put a big cowboy hat on you  You could?  Would it sound awful?  Would it sound awful?  Yeah  Wait, wait  When you're unplugged  How about acapella?  No  No  As in, why not?  I mean, we're here  We got microphones  Sunframe, yes  You are correct, sir  He did get a viral infection  That made him sensitive to light 
[00:59:00]  And he has been cured of it now  But it was a serious viral infection  I like to think that he's been living in the dark for the last ten years  That is a horrible thing  There's two pets that are both  Oh  Oh  Hey, marble mouth  What?  I'm hungry  He's hungry  For surgery, they should insert a funny bone  Tee hee  So why can't we get an acapella version of Foundry? 
[00:59:30]  I mean, of Pendulum  I think the guys would love it  I know I would  Yeah, you work on that while we're on vacation  Okay, I will  I mean, today  Today  I don't honestly remember all the lyrics  All right  You got until we get  I could do the chorus  And that's about it  You got  The day we get back from vacation  You're doing that on the show  So you got a week to practice  You got it  Let's say hi to Kristen in Union  Kristen  Hey guys, how you doing?  Good  I love you guys  Listen, my husband and I went and saw Journey about three years ago  Actually, I went to go to the opening band when Fuel was really big 
[01:00:00]  Even though they sucked  But my husband went to Journey  And they were amazing  They put on an incredible show  I couldn't tell if it was Steve Perry or the other guys  They were really, really good  Yeah, I don't know, man  I think that guy just turned me around a little bit  I don't really like seeing these bands without the lead singer  The good guy  But wow, he could hit it  I thought Anthony's old pal Hugo could do the Journey thing  Hugo, yeah  But that guy, wow  Hugo looks just like him, too  Yeah  Thank you, Kristen  You guys are great  I love you 
[01:00:30]  Oh, thanks  Dan, North Carolina  Hey, Dan  Hello  Hey, you're on the air  Yeah, stand up  Yeah, I saw him in Charlotte on Saturday night, man  That guy is dead on  They're not missing Steve Perry  Yeah  Steve Perry must be at home  Just freaking kicking walls all day long  Does he look like him at all?  Yeah, he's got the long hair  Long, dark hair like Steve Perry had 
[01:01:00]  Okay  I mean, he's a short little dude  But man, he can put it out  There's a surprise  A Filipino that's short  Steve Perry was last seen at the store  Buying charcoal and lighter fluid  Let's go to Bruce, Louisiana  Brucey  Yeah, hey, yeah  Doesn't Brother Joe do a thing with Aerosmith songs  Where he runs them all together  And you can't tell where they change?  Um  Yeah, I'm not sure 
[01:01:30]  I don't remember that  I don't know  I thought they talked about  I'm not my brother's keeper  I wanted more improv out of Steve  Yes  Yes  So great  Fantastic  Totally devoid  Of any improvisational skills  Who's replacing you in the family?  Another morbidly obese  Replacing me, Matt  Apparently Wikipedia has Steve Perry's bio picture  A picture of him cooking over a barbecue 
[01:02:00]  Interesting  Foreshadowing?  Ask Sam  All right, we're going to take a break  Drew Boogie  Drew  Drew Boogie will place into break  Oh, he's in the hissy  That's right  Go  Booyah  Booyah  Booyah  Booyah 
[01:02:30]  Booyah  He was banging cocktail waitresses  Two at a time  Players couldn't get a drink at the table  Don't come to last thing

Hey, Jimmy  First of all, I wanted to say good luck with your operation today  Thank you  Yep  And, well, most importantly  You know, when you're done  I hope you come out looking like Andy Robinson did  In the area after he paid that guy to beat that crap out of him 
[01:04:00]  You know  All black and blue  Yeah, I'll show my eyes  I'll have little black eyes  You know, you could walk around saying it was  Salon  Yeah  You know  He didn't get a laugh  And then he goes  You know  Hey, you know  A good luck frunkus to you, Jimmy  Thank you  Yeah, when is the surgery today, Jimmy?  I think it's 1230  Which is like the earliest one of the afternoon  I'm hungry  Wait, 1230 as in  Right after noon?  Yeah  So right after the show  An hour later, you'll be 
[01:04:30]  I might even have to leave early  I have to call him  Well, that's obvious  I have to be there at 1030, I think  Wow  So, how long does this procedure take?  Did they tell you?  They said about an hour  An hour?  Oh, that's okay  He told me what they do  It's not  They fix my septum a little bit  And my turbinates are the ones  These things in your nose that regulate  Turbinates  Yes, we have, I think, three on each side, I think  Turbinates  They swell up  Oh  When you lay down  Your head, when you're stuffy  It gets worse sometimes 
[01:05:00]  That's your turbinate swelling up  And they regulate temperature and airflow in your nose  But mine are swollen  So what are they going to do?  Scrape them down or something?  No, it bleeds too much  What this guy does is when you're asleep  He puts a needle in it  And he electrically heats it  And it shrinks it  Holy mother of God  That's great  I mean, that's what I want  And then I want my septum fixed  It's messed up  What's wrong with your septum?  Deviated  You have a deviated septum  Are you getting a nose job?  No  That's what's happening  Jimmy's getting a nose job  Jimmy's going to have, like, different eyes and everything  A facelift 
[01:05:30]  A chin implant  You're just going to have, like  Hi, I'm Jimmy  With his face all pulled back  I hope my voice isn't different, though  I hope it is  Mike, make me different  Imagine if I come in with a big attitude  And I talk like this  Oh, the biggest ironic twist would be  If you couldn't control  That you have a radio voice  Hey, how you doing?  You just have the phony radio voice  And you can't help it  Hey, I got my nose fixed  Yeah  Oh  I'm feeling okay 
[01:06:00]  I'm not really nervous  I mean, I'm sure I will be when I get there  Well, my brother healed  And he had some of the same things done to him  He had a lot more done than that  Yeah, and his voice is back to normal  For a while there, it was high and creepy  When you got him on the phone  Yeah  Because they shaved down his uvula  Sounded like you at AAF  Yeah  Higher or creepier  There was nothing  There was nothing to his voice  Really?  It was very thin  Oh, that was scary  And we were all secretly worried  That he was going to talk like that  For the rest of his life  Especially since, you know 
[01:06:30]  Jimmy's whole career  Yeah  Is based on his voice  Yeah  You'll be fine  I think so  I mean, I don't feel really worried about it  We got someone that's in love with you, Jimmy  Debbie in New York  Wants to talk to you  Debbie  Hey, Debbie  This doesn't sound like a Debbie  It does, actually  Debbie I picked up the other night  Yeah, I guess  That's all you get  That's what Debbie interrupted our chat for 
[01:07:00]  The wah-wah penis  Which I sang into a cup when I was a boy  And my cousin John kicked me in the groin  I don't know why he did that  I had a plastic cup  And I was just going, wah-wah penis  And he just  And he kicked you  He just kicked me  Good  Good for you  They were obsessed with this journey thing  With the new Filipino singer  And Steve  He was just telling us  Yes  They recorded all their hits  With the new lead singer  Uh-huh  And they put that out, I guess  This is the new version of Separate Ways 
[01:07:30]  With the new lead singer  We all know this one  Actually, you know what?  Why don't we just go right to Don't Stop Believing  Everyone knows that song  So this is Don't Stop Believing  2008  With the brand new lead singer of Journey  That was good  Oh, wow  Of course  Same guys  Just a small town girl 
[01:08:00]  Living in a lonely world  Jesus  Why hasn't Steve Perry killed himself yet?  Are you kidding me?  Is this live?  No  It sounds different than the original 
[01:08:30]  You can tell the difference  Slight  Yeah  Very slight  By the echo and stuff  You know what's weird?  The guy seems to have more power  Yeah  Than Steve Perry has  Like Steve Perry's got power  But he's got  Like that range  When he hits those high notes  Yeah  This guy's all power  Jesus  Here's the original  Just a small town girl  Just a small town girl  Living in a lonely world  Oh, shit  He took me not to drink  And leave it 
[01:09:00]  Steve Perry  Totally expendable  Yeah  That's the original  That's Steve Perry  Just a small town girl  Except he had something wrong with his teeth  To begin with that song  That's rich  Voss  Singing for a journey  Besides that  Amazing  Just a small town girl  Living in a lonely world  She took me not to drink

[01:10:00]  Just a city boy  Born and raised in South Detroit  He took the midnight trailer  Anywhere  How funny would it be if  It turned out like Journey was  You know  On vacation in the Philippines  And they got caught for doing some things  And they went  No we're here to 
[01:10:30]  Finally sing  For our band  Now they're stuck with  Guy  Don't stop  Believing  We're really good at  Finding that dumb  One little thing  And just going  Over the top  Listen how the song starts  Rich Voss  Wait that wasn't one of you guys  Making that noise  In the microphone  No that was him  Please can we hear that again 
[01:11:00]  That's got to be a bad recording  No  Oh that's him  What is that?  Well it looks like he'd cry  If you threw garbage at his feet  Wow  He definitely looks  A little American Indian  Few people want to get through  They're saying that  Blind Melon has a new lead singer  Oh yeah  They had one hit  Why  Yeah why bother  What are you doing  Just make a new band  What are you doing  And then you got Sticks  Without Dennis  Wait wait wait  Can we hear what the start  Of the next verse is

[01:12:30]  She's a little off there now  I know it's a little  You do this  No keep yours going  A singer in a smoky room  Smell of wine and cheap perfume 
[01:13:00]  For a smile they can share the night  It's on and on and on  And the strangers  Waiting  Walking down the pool  Of all their shadows  In searching of the night  That's pretty amazing  That's going back and forth 
[01:13:30]  Between the two  That guy hits that note  Now  Which one are we playing right now  Seriously  The old or the new  Only because of the recording  Yeah  I think this is the new  But I actually got lost  That one  Yeah  Is it the new or the old  Right here  This is new  Walking up  Getting my feel

[01:26:00]  you guys look a little beat up  I wish people had a visual  the morning thing  kicking  Jimmy just looks like  I've never seen you  your face  you just look like  you want to nap  I haven't eaten  it's all about napping  Jimmy's getting surgery  it's all about wanting to nap  and he hasn't eaten  in about 12 hours  so he's starving  what's going down  just my sinuses  I'm having my nasal  to clean out your snot box  yeah  and you didn't go see 
[01:26:30]  the other night  what happened  you weren't here yesterday  Jimbo  yeah I was here  oh you were here  yeah yeah  I was in  okay  never mind  never mind  well you're mad at him  because he didn't go see  Judas Priest  I was waiting  at Motorhead right  that's right  I didn't have your number  that's right  we'll figure it out  if you  you gotta go see Priest  they're playing Jones Beach  all I'm gonna say  if you're a Priest fan  no offense to Motorhead  and Heaven and Hell  and a little D.O.  where off to  don't worry about him  priest 
[01:27:00]  animal  yeah  60 years old  I was 70  60  wait  Halford's 60  57  doesn't matter  no it doesn't matter  that's close enough  close enough  in gay years  it's like 68  yeah  in gay years  he's 300  he is quite the queen  isn't he  I like that  gay years  where's the deal  in that one from you  in gay years  he's 78 years old  well Jimmy  Jimmy was there  at the Hard Rock  when they did  a little private show  and it was the first time 
[01:27:30]  I guess Halford  feels comfortable  about being out there  and did you watch him  every once in a while  he would flail  his little wrist  you know  he's like  he's singing  Devil's Child  and he's almost  like doing a little  with his hands  like a hula move  what is that  yeah  inside think  I believe  you're the devil  but it's coming out  like  I believe  you're the devil  yeah  but he's  got a little  swish  this little swishy thing 
[01:28:00]  and little limpy wrists  I'm amazed  that the Hard Rock  dudes  didn't give up  on Judas Priest  after they got the news  I'm just amazed  they stuck with  Judas Priest  it's a credit  to Judas Priest  that's what I'm thinking  the talent that is  Judas Priest  what do you mean  what do you mean  a lot of the fans  of that type of music  may be a little homophobic  I would assume  they wouldn't be tolerant  they'd be like  I'm not listening  to this guy  and they would  burn all their stuff  and throw it out  the windows  sure  really  I would think  but they didn't  they had to 
[01:28:30]  the guy's  one of the best musicians ever  would you do that  to Queen  well bad example  he did it to himself  right  you want to talk about  gay years  right  but it's not like  Rob runs around  going  tonight  you know  here's you got  another thing coming  here's everyone  that's gonna gobble  later  yeah  he's not out there  promoting  but  I understand 
[01:29:00]  sure  he's still doing it  yeah  I know  Brew is a huge Priest fan  that must have sucked  when he was outed though  like cause he really  kept it together  there for a while  and then he must have  been like  I gotta deal with this now  right  how'd he get outed  I don't know  I think the rumor  is just fine  people are like  listen  you have to come out  it's obvious  yeah you know  how many of the road crew  probably saw him  going to the tour bus  with some twink  right  and just like  or a lot of them  yeah  the rest of the bands  you know  picking up girls  and everything  and the rest of the bands 
[01:29:30]  like  another autograph seeker  oh here it is  sure  did you see who Rob  went into the bus with  oh boy  that's gonna be a bad one  I think it's probably  a member of the band  trying to defend him  no man  he just wanted an autograph  he said it's a fan  he takes a lot  every stop we make  he takes a fan in  that kid  that kid came out  misguided  I'm glad I didn't meet  him at 17 years old  I remember I was  gonna stalk him  they were doing a concert 
[01:30:00]  and I was gonna go  try to meet them  at a bar  and I knew they were  gonna play at a bar  and thank god  thank god  I didn't go  17 years old  who knows  what would've happened  oh wow  you could've been on that  bus  you might've had a memory  or suppressed one  this is a surprise  I didn't see this coming  wow  hey could you sign  my home  home  I gotta tell Brewer  come here lad  I gotta tell Brewer  he played Saturday  at the PNC Bank Art Center  and he did this show  a huge huge favor 
[01:30:30]  we really needed you  this year  oh yeah  we really needed you  and you came through  and you just  you just rocked it man  what a great crowd  the crowd was phenomenal  they loved you  I didn't expect that  you know one person  who begs to differ  one angry little individual  yes  perhaps he doesn't think  the crowd was that good  well you know what  no offense  but um  a guy like him  Mike Birbigler  yes I've seen Mike before  and I  I was just saying  when I went to the  place 
[01:31:00]  and by the way  I was a little taken back  when I  when I first showed up  yeah  I went  my god  I feel like I'm at  an 82 Metallica concert  yeah  cause I  strolled in around  six and people  there were packs  of people  in a parking lot  blast  it looked like  82  metal concert  barbecues  beers  and it wasn't just kids  this was like  60 year olds  and 40 year olds 
[01:31:30]  the guy ain't working  for another week  I'm at the virus  I ain't working  on the next Wednesday  we're at the virus  Carol  oh come on  show the young guy  your breasts  I haven't felt like this  in years  and so  that's it  I definitely was worried  Jimmy swaggered in  like a rock star  he had his sunglasses on  I'm gonna tear it up again  as my night's torn  and then  I saw  Birbiglia  and I just  I kinda looked at him 
[01:32:00]  like you really  don't know  what's gonna go down  tonight  oh no  and I looked at him  with  really  I looked at him  with confusion  and I said  hey Mike  how you doing  I said  yeah  you'll have fun  tonight  and I saw  where he was  playing in the lineup  and I was like  who  did you guys  arrange  who arranged that  we've been arguing  that point for a while  I thought he was  a little too late  in the show myself  he should have been  like third or fourth  come out  did he do the guitar  and all that  no no  he just tried 
[01:32:30]  to straight stand up  yeah  he was the limping zebra  at the watering hole  he was the one  he was the newborn  this is when  the wildebeest  try to get across  the river  the crocodile  moves in  the healthy wildebeest  make it across  whoop whoop  whoop whoop  whoop whoop  there he goes  into his death roll  whoop whoop whoop  whoop whoop whoop  as Morph Zebra  is tired to help him  it's just a disastrous  ending once again 
[01:33:00]  the circle of life  continues here on  the sarangheti  whoop whoop whoop  or home dale  wherever we are  whoop whoop whoop  yeah  and yet another comic  falls into the deep  river  of the ONA virus  oh look  there's Billy Bear  swirling around him  also  someone read your  handout  that happens  hey I could have  easily been that  victim I'm happy now  because I made it to  the other side of the  bank  you're killed  yeah I was talking  to you before the 
[01:33:30]  show and you're like  you know what I'm  just gonna go out  there say hi  and I'm gonna do  10 minutes  just gonna kind of  feel it out  40 minutes later  no  we almost had to  go out there  and yank you off  the stage  you were having  so much fun  no  I didn't do  40 minutes  totally cool  I'm just saying  did you do  40 minutes though  close to it  it was funny though  that you were like  you know I'm just  gonna do just a few  yeah I'll get 3 minutes  gonna go out  say hello  yeah  and you know  hopefully they'll  cheer and I'll say  we'll see each other  in the future  about 5 minutes  into it  you were just  loving it man 
[01:34:00]  this is a good  crowd was yours  that was great  when I  when I started  doing the  Chappelle stuff  that's  that's  because I said  I just want to  let you know  I quit smoking pot  I thought they  were gonna light  the place on fire  you  you  you  you anarchist  how dare you  say such a thing  in an evening  we look forward  to see you  and then  that's when it  kicked in  the Chappelle  all I said  was hey man  well he does  Dave Chappelle  that's pretty funny  yeah 
[01:34:30]  okay we'll stick  with you for a while  see where this goes  yeah  but it turned out  great so thanks  for that  you really quit  smoking pot  yeah  how long ago  officially every day  a little less  than a year  wow  was that hard  you smoked a lot  of weed my friend  I was an everyday guy  I definitely was  an everyday guy  and when I  would come on here  forget about it  yeah no it's natural  I come in  I'd be in the hallway 
[01:35:00]  come in here  and like wow  meep meep  hey whoopee  look at me  what I miss the most  about your pot days  yeah  were the pot phone  calls from you  I mean I would just  be living my life  and all of a sudden  the phone would ring  and I'm like  hello  he's like  dude  yeah  who's this  it's bro  I'm like  I'm like  and it would go  the same way  Jim where are you  I'm in the woods  like what are you  doing in the woods  I'm smoking dope 
[01:35:30]  in the woods  and I'm watching  my wife do the dishes  do you remember  these phone calls  wow  I would go  in my woods  I guess  I've never been  to your house  but I guess  the woods  you could go in  so you feel like  you're way in nature  but you could still  kind of see the house  and the kitchen window  wow  she's doing the dishes  yeah  and I'm so high  I'm about to go  on a trampoline  in the dark  you want to listen 
[01:36:00]  ka-junk  ka-junk  that's me  we would  we would talk about  aliens and ghosts  and all sorts of crap  man  wow  you got it going  when you were  smoking the weed  I had so many  it just became  where  I was definitely  addicted  anyone says  that pot's not  addicting  it always cracks you up  people say  pot's not addicting  physically  yeah  I'm going to say  maybe it's not addicting  but mentally  it's so addicting  and I love when people  go pot's not addicting  because 
[01:36:30]  okay  scientists prove  that it's a known fact  if you're already  doing that  yeah  you're addicted  doesn't it come  show up with facts  of why you can do it  you gotta justify it  with these scientific facts  yeah  so I just found myself  constantly looking  for when I can do it  I'm like okay  so the wife works out  between 11 and 12  and then the kids  in school  it's perfect  noon to 3  whacked  out of here  so that was pretty much  your day was 
[01:37:00]  how you were going to  plan smoking weed  how I was going to plan  smoking pot  and then  and I'm not going to  you know I had  you had a moment  oh I had  no no no  I never really had a moment  well I did have a moment  with my kid  a couple of years  probably about  two and a half  three years ago  I'd play really hard  with my kids  we'd tear it up  Batman  running up and down  I'd get dressed up  we have a ball  and then my  my oldest one  said uh  dad  why are your eyes 
[01:37:30]  so red  oh  yeah  uh  they're itchy  they're itchy  I got allergies  right  but I knew  I knew  you know  a kid knows  truth  like they know  something's up  but they can't  figure it out  and she was  really looking at me  and when I  I was like  no my eyes are itchy  but when she was  staring at me  I knew  that she knew  that I was lying  wow  she just knew 
[01:38:00]  like well  I'm going to figure  this out  in my 10 years  and  we'll see how  the rebellion  goes dad  and go  daddy was a liar  he lied to me  dad used to get stoned  and play with me  that's why he was  so much fun  but  but it was definitely  but hey  I had a good time  was that the reason  you quit though  when the kids  started  no  no  I just really  um  I just realized  I really couldn't  uh  like 
[01:38:30]  I would go  okay  I'm fine  and then I would go  two weeks  I'd go away  for like two weeks  we're like sober  sober friends  I don't do nothing  and I'm like  okay  and then in two weeks  it would be okay  I would jones a little bit  I'm like well  in two weeks  and then in two weeks  it would turn into a month  like oh yeah  no  okay  and then the only times  where I think about it  it's like a concert  like the first time  in a concert  oh my god  I'd write  right before a priest  comes out  I'd go in the toilet  hit my little one hit  and I'd go out  and I'll be 
[01:39:00]  I'll be one  with the priest  and then  and then I just started  everything started  getting a lot more  clearer  and honestly  it was a stand up thing  where uh  a lot of comics  will smoke pot  because they think  they're so much  more creative  which I think  maybe you are sometimes  but also  you'll get funnier  and yeah  you're funnier  for like 20 minutes  and then you wake up  the next day  and you don't write  and you just get fat  and the next thing  you know  you just watch it pour  and you  here I am again 
[01:39:30]  here I am again  and um  I found  you know  I'd go on the road  Jimmy would tell you  the road is  it's not what  it's cut out to be  and it would  always turn into  oh it was breakfast  smoke some pot  and I'll write  and it was like  smoke some pot  walk around  figure out those aliens  uh  the conspiracies  of the world  against us  and then you know  play at my yo-yo  well now  now I'm  I'm into stand up again 
[01:40:00]  uh  I wasn't into stand up  for a long time  I got sick of it  that's why I got the band  let's get a band  you guys play  and I'll do a joke  and then I'll sing  or something  I kind of like that stage  though  I did too  I like that stage  I did too  I did too  uh  but it  I got bored  and then uh  it was the stand up thing  it was uh  I started going  you know what  I need to start going  out there  get back in the ring 
[01:40:30]  and start flexing  and beat the snot  out of some people  in the arena  and that has to come  with the clarity  so at first  I had to start  getting thinner  because I was fat  man  I was busting out  220  220  yeah  it was like a picture  of me in my  in my uh  in Chester, New Jersey  where I'm like  big fat  I'm like  three pounds  under Patrice  just a big gorilla  silver back  hanging out  munching on  some bamboo  and when I got 
[01:41:00]  to get in shape  and then um  I got in shape  and I started  clearing out  and I do think  I should write  some pot stories  though  because I do  have some  I remember  I remember  one time  Wanda Sykes  is up in Toronto  and I would hang out  Wanda's one of the  funniest people  I would ever hang out  with  just hanging out  we would goof  around here  so  I'm playing up 
[01:41:30]  with Toronto  I have a baby  and my wife's up there  and uh  the whole time  I'm like  how am I gonna get pot  how am I gonna  I'm gonna get  Canada  I don't wanna stick  on this  I'm gonna get pot  so I'm finally up there  and Wanda's like  hey I'm gonna be up there  you give me a call  I give her the number  where I'm at  and I'm like  D leaves  on Saturday  and we're gonna go  to a game  me and Wanda  are gonna go to a game  she's like  Chris Rock  send me out  with tickets  and we're gonna see  a basketball game 
[01:42:00]  I said great  we'll hook up  now I haven't heard  from her since  I've been up there  so now I'm with the baby  and my wife  and uh  I score  about uh  the day before  my wife and baby  are leaving  someone's like  hey man  I got that thing  you want  nice  real nice  so um  I take it  you know  he's like  meet me in the lobby  so as I'm going  to the airport  I take it  I put it in my pants  I'm showing  down my thing  I'm driving 
[01:42:30]  to the airport  now  soon as I get  into the airport area  there's the first  thing I see  is a guy  with a big dog  oh  right  and the dog's  walking  I'm like  hon  I gotta go  to the toilet  right back  I make a beeline  for the toilet  I'm not gonna  throw it out  I just got this  so I come back  Karen we needed that  Karen  what do you mean  you threw it out  Karen  what are we gonna do  I'm sorry  I'm sorry 
[01:43:00]  it's all we had  Karen  they weren't gonna  find it  oh Karen  I needed that money  are you kidding me  I'm sorry  I love that  the best sorry ever  so now  I come back out  and the best thing  that happened was  my wife checks in  and you can't walk  into the gated area  you just 
[01:43:30]  if you're in  Toronto  as soon as you check in  you're done  you gotta  you gotta go  yeah  there's nowhere  to hang out  so I'm like  oh bummer  okay bye hon  beeline to my room  now there's no  the windows don't open  so all right  and I got two  connecting rooms  so I tear it up  I  overdid it  because I haven't  had it in like  a week  and I  I literally 
[01:44:00]  now when I do  I like playing music  so you know  Metallica  new bones  and I'm  singing to myself  for an hour  and then I realized  wow it's really  smoky in here  and I start hearing  like keys  jingle  every  every couple seconds  outside my door  and I'm starting to hear  like bing  like a little bell  going bing  so I'm like  oh my god  they're  these guys  they're checking up  on me  and then I realized 
[01:44:30]  the smoke was all  in the room  so I start  I start flipping out  and I looked  swear to god  I looked through  the peep hole  and I swear  that there's someone  on the other side  and they know  I'm looking through  the peep hole  and I keep  and I keep  now we're playing  a cat and mouse game  so I'm gonna try  to trick them  and I quickly  look through the peep hole  to try to catch them  and then  I swear he keeps ducking  cause every time  I'd walk away  from the peep hole  I'd hear  the keys going again 
[01:45:00]  and then I'd hear  like a door  and then I'd hear  a little walkie talkie  and then I kept  hearing the ding  every two seconds  ding  like oh boy  this is  so in the  I start flipping  I do the towels  wet the towels  put them under the doors  I start flapping the towels  and flipping  I get dressed  cause I was in my underwear  and I was getting  when I would get high  and I would  I would get myself  I would change  I would like  put it into my  my concert clothes 
[01:45:30]  a little lunatic  I love it  33 years old  I gotta put on  my metal shirt  my pants  just the way  I do my concert  and all of a sudden  in the midst of this  I keep hearing the ding  we keep playing  the cat and mouse  he's not there  I listen to the peep  the phone starts ringing  now I know  my wife's gone  and nobody knows  I'm staying here  so in my head  I start going  oh my god  the phone's ringing  to try 
[01:46:00]  they know  they know  now I'm in another country  so  and all this goes  through my head  within seconds  in my head  I go  if I pick up the phone  they're gonna go  um  Mr. Brewer  we know you're high  you've smoked up  the entire 14th floor  that's illegal here  people complaining  you need to come outside  and speak to the authorities  and securities  outside your door  as you know  which you keep playing  the peephole game  and by the fourth ring 
[01:46:30]  then I went  no I'm just gonna  I'm not gonna answer it  some will leave a message  and that's that  and I started panicking  going  if I don't leave a message  then they might think  I OD'd  or something's going on  and this gives them  the reason to barge  into the room  and then when they're  in the room  I'm gonna be stoned  I'm in another country  I'm gonna be arrested  and this is a nightmare  so at the last second  it's like on the fifth ring  and all this is going  in my head  I went 
[01:47:00]  you know what  I'm just gonna  give myself up  I'm gonna  I'll spend a night in jail  give yourself up  I'm gonna give myself up  and  and I went  I'm just gonna  say yes  it's me  and I  I pick up the phone  I went  I'll be down in a second  I'm really sorry  and it was Wanda  she goes  what's up crackhead  what you high right now  I'm bugging out  and I went  you don't even know  you just brought me down  for a landing  thank you  I mean 
[01:47:30]  there was so many episodes  where I really  you know in that story  you  you failed to mention  how you got the pot  past the dog guy  you went into the bathroom  I went in the toilet  and I waited  until the dog guy  left  where he started  going down  the other way  that's all  alright  I wasn't sure  if you like  you know  no I saw him  and I made a beeline  for the opposite direction  so you were just  waiting for him  to leave the area  oh yeah  so you obviously  got pretty paranoid  when you'd smoke  oh boy  and I couldn't go in public  I couldn't go in public 
[01:48:00]  it was over  that's rough  just over  we have to take a break  our old pal  Jim Brewer  in studio  playing comics  this weekend  c-o-m-i-x-n-y dot com  if you want to get info  or give them a call  these shows are going  to be sold out  they've been packing  I didn't expect  last night to be that way  well now  it's going to be over  Johnny  so call them immediately  212-524-2500  for Jim Brewer tickets  hot room  yeah it's a cool  little join right  I didn't know  it was that cool  it was very cool  yeah they got a nice  presentation over there

You gotta  stand. Come on, final hour.  We can do this. When we did afternoons, I stood  all the time, but this morning radio, it's like...  I see the morning. 
[01:50:30]  You're just talking about it. I know  a totally different animal in the afternoons.  The morning is no joke. Oh, my God.  We would go back to afternoons in a second.  In a second. Oh, my God.  Hey, we gotta get Bob Saget on the phone  here. Bob Saget, Jim Norton,  right after the Virus show, flew out to L.A.  to do the Bob Saget Rose. So did  Greg Giraldo and a bunch of other people.  You were saying that Chloris Leachman,  she was the one to  watch, right?  You're quite the looker.  Bob Saget is on our 
[01:51:00]  phone. We missed you this year at the  Virus show, Bob.  Say again, man? We missed you at the show this year.  I know. I know. I feel bad about that.  How was it? Was it good?  Did somebody do my stuff? Did some guy just come  out and do it all?  Well, one guy should have.  He didn't do too well.  Yeah, we had one casualty.  Everybody did very well, and then we  had one casualty of the crowd.  Maybe we should get that word out to  the comedians and the  community. Look, we only had one  casualty this year. Don't be scared of us 
[01:51:30]  and our crowd.  Statistically, I mean, it's safe.  It's safer than flying. This is what I'm trying  to tell the people out there. Bob Saget  in L.A. goes, yeah, I heard about it.  They all keep in touch in the comedy  world. I heard you had one casualty.  It would happen in Baviglia?  Yeah.  He bought it.  There's no one that I kind of keep...  Someone goes and passes when I work now.  So someone told you that there was a  casualty on the show?  Yeah.  It's like the bombers in World War II. 
[01:52:00]  Six planes go out.  You know one might not come back.  You count them when they come back  and go, ah, one of them went down.  It happens.  If you make it through, you got a story  to tell and you're a hero.  Certainly.  The roast, everybody kind of survived.  Cloris' vagina didn't survive.  I gave her a beat.  Jim had a lot to do with that.  Hey, Bob, we're sort of confused  because word's getting out that you  weren't happy that the Olsen twins got  attacked during the roast. Is that coming  from you? Is that coming from other people? 
[01:52:30]  Are you half-joking? Where are we at with that?  That's from my interpreter from Spain.  I was actually, I had a little bit of  tequila, that's what they were giving,  right, Jim?  Yeah.  And then I go backstage and the guy,  a very nice gentleman from the post,  comes over and says, well, what do you think?  You think they hit him too hard?  And you guys know when you do press right away.  Then I went, yeah, yeah, I guess a couple of them  took some hard shots at them, but, you know,  I love them and I love the comedians.  And so, and then it says I'm angry 
[01:53:00]  and all that crap.  So that was about it.  It was that simple a thing.  Oh, so it's not that big of a deal  is what you're saying.  No, it was three hours of four kinds of jokes,  which was, look how fat that guy is,  look how ugly that person is,  what an idiot sag it is.  That was mostly my stuff.  And then the girls, they did their,  you know, it was an attack,  it was a land attack.  But it was...  Must have gotten nasty with them, though.  I mean, come on.  It was a crazy fun night, though. 
[01:53:30]  Wouldn't you say, Jim,  it was a good, fun experience all in all?  It was great, dude.  And it was funny,  with Brewers here,  we were talking about getting high,  and I flew in that day,  and I've never...  I was so tired.  I literally...  I've never felt like  I couldn't collect my bearings  when I performed before.  But I was like,  I feel like I'm high.  Like, before I went out,  I literally was afraid  to not read something off the paper.  I wouldn't be able to remember it.  I've never been that tired  before performing.  Wow.  And I'm like,  that's what it's like  to be on stage high.  I don't know how guys do it.  But no, it was still great, 
[01:54:00]  and the crowd was great.  There was no casualty at all.  I mean, everybody did well  on the show.  Nobody...  Yeah, no bombings.  Boy, did Suzy Espin  catch a beating.  Oh, really?  Why?  Just about our looks.  And one of the funniest lines  Cloris Leishman has,  she goes,  which one of you fellas  is Suzy Espin?  Suzy Espin said,  I wish somebody  would hit me in the face  so I could see some stars.  Oh, yeah.  And then she looked at me  and said,  I met Bob's girlfriend.  One thing we know about her,  she's not a star effer. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, she was great.  Cloris Leishman was fantastic.  She was the star  of the night, I thought.  Nobody bombed.  Nobody.  I mean, Garland was good.  Espin was good.  Jeff Ross, of course.  I can't wait to see that.  It was really good, man.  Norm chose to go odd  and clean,  and he was pretty hilarious.  He decided to do  old school comedy.  You know,  you got a dog face.  That means you look  like a dog.  Then he would stare you down  in that creepy way  and make you feel  uncomfortable with an audience  and then you'd laugh.  We are huge fans  of Norm MacDonald. 
[01:55:00]  We can't get him on the show,  but we are massive fans  of that guy.  I'll talk to him about it.  We had a hard time  because we were all concerned  about Artie and stuff  and then that didn't happen.  Yeah, Artie was supposed  to do you a roast  and he went into rehab instead.  Yeah, well,  people make choices.  Roast, rehab, whatever.  Are you saying  it's going to cost him?  He made the wrong decision there?  I can't wait  to take him out  for a couple drinks  to celebrate.  Well, of course.  You know what Norm said?  It was almost like  Norm's whole thing  was to make Saget laugh. 
[01:55:30]  It was like  he just wanted  to make you laugh  and when he said,  Bob, he's the same  old stinker he's always been,  that made me laugh  harder than probably  anything anybody said.  Stinker.  He called you a stinker.  Yeah, he's a stinker.  Hey, Bob,  we got Norm MacDonald  in studio today.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob,  how are you?  Hey, how are you, Norm?  Yeah.  Yeah, good times, eh?  I didn't offend you,  did I, Norm? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, no, no, not at all.  I had a great time, you know.  I'm kind of on FM radio,  so it's kind of  out of my element.  Hey, how about them peaches?  When you get to the pit,  there's always a pit.  Hey.  Hey.  That's so,  that's so Norm.  Yeah, good times, eh?  Someone said,  I think it was Susie  that said he's got to  get that suit back 
[01:56:30]  to his father's coffin.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, damn.  You know,  Norm even does  seven minutes  about his dad.  He's got that thing,  he's got an amazing piece  where he goes,  I'm standing at the funeral  and looking at a dead guy  and this woman comes over  and this guy comes over  and says,  hey, you want a sandwich?  He goes,  I don't know,  I'm looking at a dead guy  and I don't know  if I should have a sandwich.  So I'm eating a sandwich  and I'm looking at this dead guy 
[01:57:00]  talking about his father.  Oh, man.  It was a good time.  I missed you there, Jim.  I wanted you to be there.  Oh, yeah, Brewer.  Yeah.  You're my hero  for another mother.  Yeah.  Well, missed you too.  So we got the roast  is Sunday there, Bob,  August 17th, 10 p.m.  on Comedy Central.  I can't wait to watch this one.  I think it's fun.  It's 90 minutes 
[01:57:30]  and then I guess  it's about 48 minutes  of commercials.  Is it really an hour and a half?  Aren't they usually an hour?  It's an hour and a half show, yeah.  I mean,  it's literally 63 minutes.  Does Comedy Central start?  I was in Atlanta  and I started watching  one of the roasts.  It was like Jeff Foxworthy roasts.  Right.  And it was,  I guess it was on 1030  and it was full-blown HBO style.  Yeah.  I mean, F-bombs and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  On Comedy Central?  Yeah, and I went,  whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa.  And it turns to the channel  and I'm like,  this is Comedy Central. 
[01:58:00]  So what?  Yeah, after a certain hour.  They're just full-blown.  I mean, it's like HBO.  Full-blown, unedited, everything.  Yeah.  This will be cut.  This will be bleeped at Night Day, Eric,  just because they're scared.  They got,  but they'll put through some jokes.  I think you can say full-blown now.  That was one of the terms  that they could actually,  but they don't let you do the F-bomb  and you can't,  there's a lot more C at this one  than they used to be.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah, but they run the network. 
[01:58:30]  When this comes out on DVD,  do they give you the unedited version?  Yeah, they do all kinds of stuff.  They'll show Jeff Garland taking a crap,  things like that.  Why weren't the Olsen twins there?  They didn't,  I think they didn't want to be,  sit there and get arrows thrown at them  the whole time.  I just,  Yeah.  Oh, you don't think everybody  would have been nice to them  sitting there?  Yeah, right.  They're going to be nicer  if they show up.  It was so nice for you to make an appearance.  We're not going to do any references 
[01:59:00]  to you now.  Yeah.  Was Dave Coulier mad  if people hit him?  No.  He actually was happy  because he got into,  once he got into that mindset,  it's the same mindset.  I mean,  you can't,  I mean,  for three weeks,  I've been walking around  looking at people  and going,  boy,  their teeth are rotted,  ugly,  fat teeth,  you know?  He had to turn that thing on,  but he kind of turned on  the defense mode,  so he was kind of laughing.  If it was a well-constructed joke,  he was just finding it really funny.  I felt,  I feel guilty after Rose  all the time.  Like,  I'm like,  I had to apologize to Chloris. 
[01:59:30]  I'm like,  I hope she's not mad  because I really hit her  with some large,  you know,  what a woman doesn't want large,  I implied hers was a lot.  Oh,  it was very large,  really?  Yeah.  There was so much  that was going on  in there in her life.  Wow.  I never heard so much.  You had a mall,  I mean,  there's all kinds of things.  Yeah,  it was filthy.  And I used to put a Best Buy  in there for what you were doing to her.  I felt bad.  And it's like,  you apologize.  People are like,  no,  I didn't care.  I wasn't offended.  But I actually do,  at times at a roast,  feel like,  ugh.  Don't they expect it?  Yeah.  Being at the roast?  You still feel a little guilty sometimes.  Like,  now that I go too far.  And you don't feel guilty  after this radio show? 
[02:00:00]  Never.  Oh my God,  the stuff we do on this thing.  Never.  And,  you know,  I think with Ashley and Mary Kate,  I think it did go overboard.  But there,  that was a three-hour taping,  you know.  Down to 63 minutes,  you pick ones that hopefully are jokes  that just kind of,  most of the jokes make fun of me.  They infer that I did things to people.  Hey, Bob,  we've been hanging with you for a while now,  and you really take the Olsen twins  very seriously.  What's that all about?  I mean, 
[02:00:30]  you really,  you really have a feeling of...  That compassion you have.  Well,  you want to,  you want to,  no,  because you are,  you're an animal.  Yeah.  Everyone is starting to find out  that you're an animal,  and your stand-up is extremely dirty.  You go after a lot of things,  and you don't hold back.  But with the Olsen twins,  there's some kind of a protection thing you do.  I think it's like being a dad.  I mean,  there are even a couple jokes  about my own kids.  They just,  they don't even land that great  by the other comedians.  And I don't,  I guess I put them in that category. 
[02:01:00]  Like they're my daughters.  He's known them  since they were little tater tots,  so.  Yeah.  I guess the point of Megan,  that's the only thing  that's almost off limits with you.  He has fake compassion  for his fake daughters.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  I try to become my daughters  at some point,  then I leave people alone.  It has nothing to do  with the fact that  they're billionaires,  and you might need  their help someday.  No.  That's what I'm hoping.  I hope they're like,  they're like my Phil Rizzuto.  Yeah.  They might one day  have a store full of money  and save me.  Bob's got to be worth,  I'm going to guess 50 million. 
[02:01:30]  I could be wrong,  but I'm going to say way more.  Oh, way more.  Okay.  Yeah, Bob's.  Me or them?  You.  I've got a new show  I can promote.  Oh.  What's that?  It's actually one you might like  because it was stupid  that One Versus 100  didn't continue  because, Opie,  you were like beyond  kind to that show.  Wait, that's finally over?  Yeah, they killed it  without telling anybody  because they were ashamed  and they killed it.  You know what?  This One Versus 100,  they never gave it a,  whatever.  See, I'm obsessed with the show.  They just gave you  a horrible time slot.  You were more loyal to it  than the producers. 
[02:02:00]  I really did like it,  but it was on  when everyone was out partying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It had that time slot.  It would have been good  with a little more  holes barred on it.  Friday Night's a terrible slot.  The CW is not a bad place  because it's got  all this new stuff,  but I've got a series,  we're doing 13 of them  called Surviving Suburbia.  It's about a guy  that doesn't really  like being married,  doesn't really love  his kids that much,  and he lives in a neighborhood  he doesn't like the neighbors.  It's kind of a disgruntled  version of everything.  I love when people go, 
[02:02:30]  CWs,  they've been saying that  since that was created.  Yeah.  It really just comes down,  hey,  they pay network money too.  They'll pay hundreds  of thousands of dollars  per episode.  Hey,  you know,  I know it's mostly black.  Back then it was like,  hey,  I know the Wayans own,  but hey,  I'm the only white guy.  It's really on the way up.  It was the WB at the time.  They wanted us to do  Full House on it.  We were like,  no,  because it's not a real network.  And then WB went away  and now it's the CW. 
[02:03:00]  It sounds like it's got  dirty letters to something,  doesn't it?  CW.  C and CW.  Hey,  Bob,  when are we going to go out again  and have some of that human skin  that you turned me on to?  Well,  when are you,  I'm coming,  I'm coming into town.  You're on vacation next week,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  Are you out of town?  Are you going to?  I might be hanging around.  I might be doing a local vacation.  A staycation,  they're calling it now,  Alpi.  A staycation.  I'd go out with you  and eat some skin.  Bob,  just kind of stay at home.  We went to this restaurant last year 
[02:03:30]  and it looked like human skin.  Some kind of like Italian bologna.  Yeah.  That looks like human skin.  It kind of has that texture.  It was called Franco's House  of Eating My Own Family.  It's really good.  I'd eat a person with you.  Yeah,  all right.  A little cannibalism.  So,  Bob.  When do you come to town?  What day are you coming in?  Wednesday,  Thursday?  I'm coming in Tuesday  and Jimmy,  I'm coming to you Wednesday,  I think.  Why?  Oh,  what? 
[02:04:00]  Where?  Brewer?  Oh,  what,  me?  I think it meant me.  You're not coming this week.  I'm off.  You're off too?  Yeah,  I'm off for the next two weeks,  slugger.  You want a slugger?  I'm off all next week,  too.  That's terrible.  Unless Correale.  No,  we're definitely off.  You're not doing any radio next week.  Oh,  my God.  What am I coming in for?  Getting on a plane to eat the skin.  How's your daughter doing?  Really good.  Yeah,  we met her backstage at Westbury. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah,  she survived all that crap,  but she's fine.  She's very nice.  Yeah,  thank you.  How are you,  how are you intending that?  No,  she's,  she's,  ah,  how are you intending that?  She's,  uh,  she's quite lovely there,  Bob.  Marge,  girl,  she's an artist.  She paints.  Yeah,  she does.  Paints well.  Hey,  uh,  you didn't,  did anybody,  no one said anything  that really offended you,  did they?  No,  not really.  Do you think anybody got pissed off at anything?  For a,  you know what,  I think every,  only thing people got pissed off at is,  are they going to cut this out?  Because it's my favorite, 
[02:05:00]  most offensive joke.  I don't really,  I don't really understand why you're worried.  I'm not even,  just I'm saying in general.  Is that,  is the roast getting kind of politically correct now?  No,  no,  no,  no.  I'm curious as to reaction,  that's all.  It went too far,  as far as filth,  but,  um,  I just,  I really thought it was a good time,  because I literally like everybody.  I mean,  I didn't really know,  uh,  I don't know,  Cloris Leachman,  although she's coming over here tomorrow night.  All right.  I don't really know.  Hubba,  hubba.  And Brian, 
[02:05:30]  Brian Sussain's going to join us in that one,  but,  and I don't know Brian really well,  but everybody else,  I mean,  I got relationships.  And everybody,  we've hung out and we,  we,  we like each other a lot.  So it was,  it was actually,  I couldn't wait to hear the terrible things they were saying.  So if something's wrong with me,  that I would like that body punching,  you know,  Brian's just a big,  creepy looking animal.  I had a joke about him.  You'll have to believe what I'm saying.  I did one joke.  I didn't get to say was,  uh,  but Geraldo said something about it.  The villagers chasing him. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Pitchforks and torches.  Oh,  I asked him if any other lesbians survived.  The fire.  What was that about?  Brian?  What,  what,  what lesbians did you mean?  Uh,  uh,  just to his parents.  Oh no,  his parents and his whole,  all of his family had been killed.  It was all lesbians.  Uh,  then there was a fire and he got out of it.  And that's all,  that's what's left of you.  If you're in a horrible fire with lesbians,  he really is a big creep.  Yeah.  I said that he had a, 
[02:06:30]  um,  that his face looked like a clitoris with ears,  but they,  they thought that was a little harsh.  So I didn't get to do that.  It's a little.  Yeah,  absolutely.  Hey Bob,  we're running out of time over here.  I love you guys.  And,  um,  I'm really happy none of you are working next week,  so I can't see you.  Yeah,  that sucks.  But,  but I'll give you a call,  Opie.  All right,  we'll see you on TV though.  August 17th,  10 p.m.,  Comedy Central,  the Bob Saget Roast.  I'll be in town,  Bob,  and I'll be lonely.  Yeah.  And I'll go to the cellar with you then.  No,  Jimmy's going to be recovering from his, 
[02:07:00]  uh,  surgery.  Yeah,  you're getting the nose thing.  Do they do it from the outside or the inside?  They go up and then it's fine.  Boom.  It's less than an hour.  I'll be,  I'll bet Tuesday I'll be,  I'll be still laid up,  but I'll be out of Jell-O.  Well,  you won't have to wear that stuff anymore on,  that holds it down,  right?  No,  the nose thing,  no,  I should be fine.  Good.  And Jimmy Brewer?  Yes.  Are you in town?  Uh,  no,  I'm going to be in Pittsburgh.  Okay.  Sorry,  Hammer.  So why don't you just stay in L.A.,  Bob?  Some people call your show to like,  uh,  you know,  just promote their stuff.  I just,  I'm looking for play dates. 
[02:07:30]  No,  go out with people.  All right,  Bob,  we'll see you soon.  It was good seeing you,  man.  August 17th.  What time is it,  Rose?  10 p.m.?  August 17th,  10 p.m.  Starring Jim Norton.  Cool.  Wow.  He's hilarious in it.  All right.  Thanks,  buddy.  Thank you,  Bob.  Okay.  Love you guys.  See you,  man.  Bye.  Yeah,  we got to get out of here.  Brewer's playing comics this weekend here in New York City.  I will definitely be at the second show tonight.  I'll see you tonight.  I got to see you.  I haven't seen your stand up in a while.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  And what's the number for comics? 
[02:08:00]  These tickers are going fast.  I'm telling you.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2500.  This will be a sellout.  Partying down there tonight,  so get your tickets immediately.  All right?  And Stephen S. from Bayshore,  he wants to promote my brother's restaurant.  It's not me.  I'm telling you it's not me.  Really?  I guess there's like a fan thing happening tomorrow night.  Yes.  At Bayf Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village,  400 New York Avenue.  A little soiree.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you going? 
[02:08:30]  Probably.  Why?  What's going on?  I'm out of the loop.  It's just like a bunch of people get together,  a few beers, hang out.  All right.  A goose and duck soiree.  Goose and duck soiree.  Married man, Mr. Grady?  Anthony, you didn't take care of your guy.  What happened?  Keith the Cop.  He wants us to promote his thing.  I forget everything.  I forget my brother's gigs.  Keith the Cop wants us to let the fine folks know  that the Massapequa Fire Department 
[02:09:00]  is hosting the 14th Annual Canoe for Kids,  a day of canoe races,  a raffle for a Harley Davidson,  and $15,000 in cash  and lots of family activities, right?  Oh, yes.  They're trying to help the family of Corey Mendoza  and Michael DiNunzio.  Right.  He's fighting leukemia,  so they're trying to do the right thing  and get some money for these kids and other kids.  For info, go to canoe4kids.com.  I think that's the easiest way.  Canoe, the number four, kids.com. 
[02:09:30]  Very good.  Don't spell out four.  Canoe4kids.com.  We'll have that plug up on onaradio.com.  Brewer.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Good seeing you.  What a pleasure, man.  It's been way too long.  Good seeing you.  And after vacation, I'm doing your show.  Sounds good.  I'm doing some satellite with Brewer.  Bring you up there to Sirius.  Yeah, we were there.  We were there in the early days.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I know that building very well.  And then we were showing the door,  and I haven't been there in four years. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  But I'll be back there.  We'll be up there.  I'm a big happy family now.  Absolutely.  I want to thank Drew Boogie.  He ran over to XM to kind of, like, set up.  So we're going to continue over at XM, or SiriusXM,  whatever the hell the company's called these days.  And we'll see you guys soon.  We're taking a little vacay.  We'll see you in about a week.  Bye.  Have a great weekend.  Bye-bye.  Brewer, comics tonight.  Let's go.  Let's party.  Let's do it. 
[02:10:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:00]  Nice.  True boogie, everyone.  Opie and Anthony, XM, Satellite Radio.  Screw that new name.  It's still XM to me.  At least for now, right?  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Brewer did not make the walkover with us today.  Aw.  He's got some personal stuff going on.  After the show, he was giving me inside stories about Metallica and ACDC that were hilarious. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, really?  And he goes, please, why am I even bringing it up?  Because I can't even tell you what he was telling me.  Problems?  It was very entertaining.  He said eventually he'll talk about it, but whatever.  I shouldn't have brought that up.  I'm sorry.  We got a huge crowd outside the studio.  Yeah, my God.  Some familiar faces, some new faces, more people downstairs that couldn't get in.  But they're going to get up here as well.  We'll find room for them.  Yeah, it's a huge crowd.  Yeah, absolutely.  And Shane O'Mac is in studio with us today.  Yes, finally. 
[02:12:00]  What is this?  Fucking 2000 what?  When did we get fired?  Yeah, it was a while ago.  What is this?  2001 all over again?  First Brewer and then Shane.  Shane hasn't done our show in like four years.  It's been a while.  Six years, actually, because we had to take a couple of years off there, Shane.  It's all good.  Nice to be back.  Thanks for having me.  Well, absolutely.  I hear you got a big announcement, so why don't we get that out of the way?  A major announcement about your career.  About my career?  Yeah.  You're talking about specifically maybe because I'm a new uncle.  My sister and Triple H just had a new baby. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  So she's a little girl.  Her name's Murphy.  So I guess that's my big announcement.  Isn't this taking that work a little far?  You know, I mean, they really are committed to this angle.  They're committed, right?  They're committed to it.  You know, when they first started going out, it was like, wow, this is a cool little angle.  Yeah, life-humitated art.  Yeah, you've been playing this up now for years and babies are involved.  Right.  And I guess it's real.  You know, you've got to start thinking it's a real thing.  Hunter and I have been talking about this new smoking hot chick we want to bring in. 
[02:13:00]  And then maybe he can have like this extracurricular thing on TV.  But, you know, Steph's not going for it.  Oh, was it his idea?  Of course it was.  It's for the show.  It's for the show.  Anything for the show.  I can't believe she's a mom now when it seems like just yesterday she was shackled to the steam room in the crawl space.  And that was hysterical.  You have to scream it.  I remember that.  It's one of my favorite moments.  Yeah, you never let her die.  It's great.  Yeah, she was just so despondent being down there. 
[02:13:30]  And the raw emotion she had, the tears, everything was just fantastic.  Can we find that?  I would love to play that today.  It really is great.  I don't think it's in the lead.  No way.  Maybe on YouTube or something we can find it.  But the acting was terrific.  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  It was just amazing.  And then she was dressed like, for a while, she just dressed like, I don't know, like Laura Ingalls from Little House on the Prairie.  And then all of a sudden she comes out like, you know, gangbusters, all dressed real nice and sexy and hot and everything. 
[02:14:00]  And it was a new woman who hit the ring.  Yeah.  So, well, congratulations to them.  That's fantastic.  How many kids do they have now?  They have two.  Two girls.  Two girls.  Right on.  I remember back in the day when we were doing the XFL with the McMahons.  The what?  And I remember we, Anthony and I showed up at Giant Stadium and Shane was there.  And he takes one look at us and he goes, you guys aren't going to wear that on TV today, are you? 
[02:14:30]  Next thing you know, he's buying us all sorts of stuff.  I'm sure you don't even remember.  Yeah, I do.  We're outside of the chain link fence.  You do remember.  Yeah, we needed jackets and stuff.  I was like, all right, I'll be right back.  And he bought us a whole wardrobe like, put this on.  It's better than what you guys came with.  I just noticed that we have belts.  I have my name on it, but I didn't even notice that.  I thought it was Sam's belt.  No.  These are great.  It's a special gift.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, man.  I'm sitting here looking at this and I'm like, why is Sam's thing in front of me?  I like that mine isn't very big. 
[02:15:00]  It is.  You're an Italian.  That's like what you'd wear anyway.  A ring.  A pinky ring.  Tremendous.  Tremendous.  This is great.  What are we the champs of, though, Shane?  I like this.  What kind of titles do we have?  Well, I'm apparently the world heavyweight wrestling champion.  Right, so I guess you'd be the equivalent of CM Punk.  Heavyweight, though.  I'm a little, don't quite fit heavyweight.  And then you got the WWE title, you know, which is held by my brother-in-law, Triple H, right now. 
[02:15:30]  So there you go.  Yeah.  Is that this one?  Big one.  You as well.  Fantastic.  When did you realize you had to give him a little more respect?  Who, Hunter?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  I mean, you know, there was a time he was just considered one of those wrestling guys.  One of the guys.  The next thing you know, he's at Thanksgiving dinner with you guys.  That had to be a little weird.  I think probably then, you know, it started to be a little real.  Like, what the fuck, man?  That is odd.  Next thing, he's on the private jet and all that.  Yeah, it makes it interesting.  He used to be in a freaking van with the rest of the guys, right? 
[02:16:00]  It's tremendous.  It's great.  Yeah, we bust his chops.  Mike's a good dude, though.  No, we love him.  He does our show all the time.  Oh, and he comes on here.  It's fantastic.  We've had nothing but a great time every time he's on.  He's like, I'm not a lot of spank chicks anymore.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God.  I remember her name and everything.  Peaches went home with a sore hiney, Shane.  She actually had burst blood vessels in her butt from his big meat hand.  I'm like, Triple H is an angry man.  Yeah.  What is he doing? 
[02:16:30]  It's like, what the fuck, dude?  It was supposed to be fun.  Yeah.  She's bleeding from the ass.  It was for him.  Yeah, it was.  And Vince, oh, my God.  Your dad, he's taken it to the next level again of insanity.  With the injuries he's sustained now with the sign or the lights.  What was it?  It was a sign, wasn't it?  Well, it was a whole lot of factors.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of things that fell apparently right on top of him.  Wow. 
[02:17:00]  You saw it.  Well, I saw it, and as far as Sam says, because Sam saw it, too.  It fell right on Mr. McMahon.  And we saw that he got into the safe area, Shane.  I think you need to hire us so it would look a little better than it did.  But he was very injured.  It was like that old video.  What was it?  Charlie Chaplin with the house falling, but he's in the doorway, but the whole house falls  around him.  It's kind of like what you guys set up for your dad.  But why wouldn't they say what the injuries are?  Well, you've got to stay tuned. 
[02:17:30]  That's the whole thing.  Well, I mean, it should be, you know.  You've got to stay tuned.  But you've got to go back.  You know, you call it the safe area or whatever.  Imagine the balls it takes to stand out there, really not knowing what's going to happen.  Yeah, true.  When you have unbelievable, you've got metal falling, you've got everything, you really  don't know what's going to happen.  And all of a sudden it starts collapsing.  Imagine if your chair, all of a sudden there was a trap door and then stuff started falling  out.  You don't know what the fuck's going on.  It is true.  That's a little nerve wracking.  You've got to give some props there to the chief.  Well, of course, he's always been willing to throw himself right into it. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, he's insane.  Yeah, he is crazy.  And is the lawsuit over now between you and my dad on the intellectual property infringement  of your fire?  Oh, you're fired.  Yeah, because now he's impersonating you.  I know.  I was just curious.  See, we were laughing our asses off.  We said that.  I know.  Vince is now doing Anthony's impression of Vince.  Exactly.  We were laughing our asses off listening to him do that one day.  We were just like...  Bet you're growing up with that.  You know, he was like, geez. 
[02:18:30]  Why don't you come in here and bring your report car?  Hey, Shane, was there something else you wanted to do with your life before your dad said you're  going into the family business?  Actually, he gave me the choice.  This is something I always wanted to do.  It's a great business, but I always wonder about guys like yourself.  It's like, maybe he wanted to do something else.  Yeah, I thought a lot about it.  I was going to go more in investment banking.  A lot of my buddies do that down on Wall Street and a whole lot of other things that way.  So I've always had that knack of doing more business stuff that way. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  But then, you know, drawn towards this business, I mean, I've had the most unbelievable education  because we're so vertically integrated.  We're a licensing company.  We're a merchandising company.  We're a live event company.  We're pay-per-view.  We're television, PR, production.  So, I mean, I've had the unbelievable opportunity of just being, you know, involved in everything.  Soup to not setting up the ring, refereeing, being a talent on occasion.  I'm sure you've done.  Yeah.  Well, we've seen it take some bumps for sure, especially years back. 
[02:19:30]  You used to, I was amazed because you would get in that ring and take as much shit as any  of the wrestlers.  Yeah.  And are you doing that anymore?  I try not to.  You try not to?  Occasionally, they dust me off.  Yeah.  I get back in there.  It hurts.  Because, I mean, there was a time they were beating the shit out of you on a weekly basis.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They were enjoying that.  You ever go, but, Dad, I'm your son.  Yeah, well, exactly.  Why are you doing this to me?  Exactly.  Get out there.  Kiss my ass! 
[02:20:00]  I'm glad that segment didn't come up.  Oh, exactly.  I'd be like, what?  I do this every day.  The little ass buffer that came out.  Yeah, buff my ass up real nice.  Oh, with the ass cream?  Yeah, the ass cream.  Oh, my God.  How the fuck does anyone sit there during a writing meeting and go, no, we've got to  do this.  Ass cream to buff Vince's ass.  Well, so much of that is spontaneous.  Yeah.  I mean, that's so much fun, especially when you're doing live television.  It just comes out.  It's no different in the show.  Something just pops in your brain and you run with it. 
[02:20:30]  And, you know, that's the extemporaneous style that, you know, when it's live, anything  can happen.  Right.  And it surely does.  It's hysterical.  Now, we have something going on here today.  Yeah, we got a...  I see a guy, you know, a couple of guys, they seem to be in wrestling makeup.  Is that what you call it?  Some old school...  Well, there's definitely an old school masked gentleman there.  Right.  Yeah, we got a trip to SummerSlam, which is on pay-per-view August 17th at 8 p.m.  I went from this Sunday.  That's it.  I know you guys are getting back from vacation that day and you'll be tuning in. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Of course.  How about you fly us down to it?  Listen to this.  No, actually, yeah, you're flying Sam and who else?  E-Rock?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Wait, why would that be on?  What mic is that?  Oh, you got to turn it on from in there?  Does this work?  Yeah, that's Sam.  That's primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  I know Sam.  Trust me.  Sam is...  They all know Sam.  He's into wrestling in his own right.  He wants to work for the WWE.  What could he possibly do for you guys, you think? 
[02:21:30]  He obviously can't wrestle.  I can wrestle.  He can stuff...  Wouldn't that be funny?  Just put him in there and just see him get cream.  Oh, my God.  Hysterical.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  We can work on that.  I'd say he does stuff turnbuckles with his hair.  Wow.  We could do just a couple simple things.  I can get up and just clothesline you out of your shoes.  Right out of your shoes.  Shane, please do that right now.  We don't have no ceiling height in here.  Please.  You have to see his feet fly up in the air.  Oh, my God.  He's like Rudy.  A hundred and nothing. 
[02:22:00]  Let's do it.  I'll take one for the team.  You're going to take one for the team?  Let's do it.  No, I don't want to hurt you.  Yeah.  He would hurt you, too.  He would really bad.  Really bad.  That pencil neck would be gone.  He's cool.  Sam's always...  He always hooks us up.  He is...  And, boy, you just cannot argue a point.  Like, let's say when Mr. McMahon, the tragedy of his limo blowing up.  There was no way he was not...  We had our doubts.  We had our doubts. 
[02:22:30]  Did we?  And Sam would not...  He was able to back up every fact on how it was actually, Vince, in that limo.  And...  Well, I had the facts, and they were there, plain and simple.  But how come the first article said the FBI was investigating until the FBI said, look,  we have nothing to do with this.  And then it was...  What was it called?  The FIC?  Then the FIC was involved.  Some law enforcement agency I've never heard of.  The FIC, they were a little too big for their uniforms.  Yeah.  I like when the FIC guys came in, and you could tell they were guys that want to be wrestlers, 
[02:23:00]  so they have big arms.  It's like when the paramedics come in sometimes.  And a ponytail.  Yeah, and a ponytail.  It's like the wrestler starter kit right there.  So the guys who think that's cool or whatever.  Oh, is that hysterical.  We had a great time with that one.  But that was pulled off beautifully.  I mean...  Ah, the foot was a little faker.  It certainly was.  What?  The foot hanging out of the car?  The swinging foot.  Oh.  You don't like the...  You don't like the swinging foot coming back in there?  It was tremendous. 
[02:23:30]  Whenever it was played back, Sam, you just heard him hear him go,  Oh my God!  Like he couldn't contain himself.  He was so upset.  Well, you don't expect to see something like that every day.  You're just watching wrestling, and all of a sudden, Vince McMahon could be dead because  his limo blew up.  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly.  Yes.  Exactly.  You don't expect it.  Yeah, you don't blink and move on to the next thing.  It's like, oh my God.  I was actually in Japan, and I got a call from a bunch of my buddies.  They said, dude, you know, I know you're away, everything, all right?  I'm like, as far as I know, what's going on? 
[02:24:00]  They said, um...  And they were really talking to me.  Oh my God!  Yeah, I'm serious.  You know, because, you know, obviously, you know, phone works everywhere.  Yeah.  You know, it's super early in the morning.  I'm like, leave me alone.  They called me, I was just like...  And then I played it real serious with them.  I said, are you serious?  I said, get the hell out of here.  I gotta go.  And I just kept doing that to everyone that was calling me.  That's great.  That's great.  I had a little fun with that.  Sam, what do you think of the new thing that happened to Vince? 
[02:24:30]  It's horrible.  Yeah?  I don't even know exactly what's wrong with him.  Yeah.  But obviously, Vince McMahon, in his private life, is a private person.  He's not this persona that he displays on television all the time.  Yeah.  And, I mean, there could be something very seriously wrong with him.  We don't know.  Have they released any information on his health?  No.  The family is keeping this private.  Oh.  So, Shane, what?  Vince decided he needed a month or two off?  Where is he?  Hawaii?  Where is he?  He's chilling.  He's chilling.  He's chilling.  Shane doesn't even go with it.  Yeah, you're right. 
[02:25:00]  He's chilling.  He's surfing.  Here's what we were saying.  Let's hear what you're saying.  If he comes back, and we were cracking up over this.  If he comes back in a wheelchair, but it's one of those real old-style wooden rickety  wheelchairs with an Afghan over him and a cane, and he could just be crotchety and mean  to everybody, I would laugh my balls off.  I hope it ends with a wheelchair match.  Yes.  You should do a wheelchair match. 
[02:25:30]  There's some kind of jousting going on.  Yeah, a wheel jousting.  I'm telling you, we can write for the show, Shane.  We should talk.  A wheelchair match with Vince McMahon.  Yeah, just bitter and crotchety.  Hey, before we do this thing for the trip to SummerSlam, my 10-year-old nephew, JD, has  discovered wrestling.  Cool.  Massive fan.  Cool.  And my other nephew, Carson, my brother's kid.  The problem is, JD is body-slamming my niece, Jamie. 
[02:26:00]  That's terrible.  And I've done my best to try to tell him that you really shouldn't do that.  I'm being serious for a second here.  Oh, you got it.  And my sisters tried.  They listen to the show every day.  Could you just give a little message to JD, and maybe some other kids out there?  Because I really don't want to see my beautiful niece in a wheelchair for the rest of  I'm going to go ahead and eat that.  Well, one thing, you know, if they, since he's such an avid fan, he obviously watches  the shows, and, you know, we try to be responsible and say, don't try this at home. 
[02:26:30]  And that's one thing that everyone should adhere, no matter what the age, whether it be  younger or whether it be older, because, you know, it is, I mean, you really can't get  hurt.  Obviously, a 10-year-old, you know, it's innate in all of us, especially as males, you  get testosterone flowing through your body.  But how old's your niece?  Eight.  Oh, brutal.  So, JD, you know, you got to relax a little bit, you know, leave it up to us.  If you want to do something, you know, do it to your uncle.  I'll take you on.  But he went to his first match at the last pay-per-view at NASA Coliseum. 
[02:27:00]  Right, right, right.  Cool.  He said it was the best day of his life.  Awesome.  He fucking had a great time, man.  That's what it's all about.  You know, at the end of the day, as long as everybody has fun and is entertained, and that's  what we do, we try to put smiles on people's faces worldwide.  That will get replaced someday by getting laid.  What?  I put smiles on people's faces worldwide also.  And while we're going down this road, just to make it fun again, but this is true, can  you now talk to my brother-in-law, Mike, and tell Mike, please don't watch porno in front  of his kid, Jamie, and his kid, Jamie? 
[02:27:30]  Geez.  I don't think Shane has anything to do with that.  But, you know, he's good at talking to the kids and the parents.  So now my brother-in-law, Mike, give him a message about not watching the porn in front  of J.D. and Jamie.  Yeah, Mike, what are you doing?  I got you, boys.  You know, like, come on.  Come on, man.  Even if it's soft porn, you're not be teaching that.  You know, how do you explain that?  He just laughs.  He thinks it's hilarious.  Ten years old, you start, you know, you've got some chemical things happening right around  ten.  Oh, and his mama wants to give him the clothesline every time. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, I can understand.  Mike, what the F are you doing?  Yeah, well, that's understandable.  All right, we got all that out of the way.  Okay, good.  That family should be much better now.  What do you got there, Sam?  You know, Shane and I have a common acquaintance.  Oh?  We can't talk about her.  No, not her.  At the New York State Wrestling Federation show in New York, I worked with Shane's friend  Pete Gass.  Yeah, I remember Pete.  Oh, Pete Gass, the posse.  He was in the WWF for, I think, a weekend.  No. 
[02:28:30]  He's a hardcore champion multiple times over.  Pete Gass.  I remember Pete from the...  What was that called?  The Mean Street Posse.  The Mean Streets of Greenwich or whatever?  Of course.  Oh, right.  The Mean Streets of Greenwich.  Yeah, man.  That was so obnoxious back then.  That was awesome.  I never appreciated the hardcore belt.  Well, you guys have never seen...  You've never seen that, you know, that part of Greenwich.  Everyone always sees, you know, the affluence and everything else.  Right, right.  When you really hit the streets and you go, you know, into the slums and things like that.  Where the homes only go for a million dollars.  That section?  Oh, those probably are really horrible, to tell you the truth. 
[02:29:00]  I'm sure they are.  All right, we're going to give this trip to SummerSlam away.  Yeah, let's do it.  We got, I think, my last count was seven aspiring professional wrestlers who all have their  own fantastic and unique characters to show us.  And what is the criteria here?  What are we looking for in these wrestlers?  Because they're going to have to do some mic work.  Yeah, well, you know, we're going to want some charisma.  That certain electric it factor that we need.  Somebody who you could see on a poster in a kid's room, you know? 
[02:29:30]  Uh-huh.  Somebody like that.  Somebody who could be the next.  Cheryl Teagues?  Cheryl Teagues.  Wow.  Someone who could be the next heavyweight champion.  Going way back.  Jesus.  I like the Farrah Fawcett poster myself.  Susan Anton.  Myrna Loy.  You remember when John Cena was in here?  No. 
[02:30:00]  Well, he was recently.  Oh, of course.  I mean, yes.  Yeah, someone like that.  Yeah, that guy's got charisma.  Right, like a John Cena or a Triple H.  And I think we might be able to find him.  All right, good.  Hey, can we take a quick break and then start the contest so we can take leaks and stuff?  Shane, you need anything?  Coffee?  You're all good?  I'm good.  You know, Sam, you can teach me about that charisma since you just kind of blew up.  Don't we have so much of it?  Yeah, let's take a break and then hook me up here a little bit.  No, Sam, about that whole thing, that was Sam really trying to impress you.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  I thought he did all right.  He could give a shit about radio if you guys come a-calling.  No.  He would leave this show tomorrow for the WWE.  Hey, we got Drew Boogie in studio.  We're going to do a quick break.  Drew's going to play us out for a minute or two here.  We'll be right back. 
[02:31:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:31:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:32:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Drew Boogie, everyone.  Let's hear it for Drew.  Yeah.  We got a full house.  We got Lazlo in studio hanging.  The day before vacation is always a big party there, Shane.  And, of course, Shane from the WWE.  Shane McMahon, who will be in charge of the WWE down the road. 
[02:32:30]  It's obvious.  Why does Jimmy's belt spin?  Jimmy's belt spins, but Anthony's doesn't.  I got a spinner, too.  You got a spinner, too?  Yeah, man.  Oh, look at that.  I don't know.  Mine's more legit.  I don't need gimmick tree.  Gimmick.  Uh-huh.  Gimmick tree?  Gimmick tree.  I mean, I'm very...  That's a tree where gimmicks are grown.  Cool.  Jeez.  I love Jimmy. 
[02:33:00]  I don't know what to do with this.  I'm very appreciative, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this thing now.  Wear it.  You put it in your back window.  You hold it over your head.  Put it in the back window or something?  Yeah, put it in the back window of your car.  Hold it over your head when you walk down the street.  You clothesline people and put it on the ceiling above your bed.  You know, check it out.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Make your nephew jealous.  I'm going to wear it nude and just flex in front of the mirror.  Jesus Christ.  I should wear it to a nude beach. 
[02:33:30]  How about us three, wear our belts, completely nude, covering up the naughty parts, and we'll  put it up on the website.  All right.  Just all full of ourselves with the WWE belts up.  All oiled up.  That's great.  That's a visual.  That's a visual.  You go first.  Hey, Sam, so let's get this thing going.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, thank you.  All right, sir.  Should we have our first contestant?  Yes.  Somebody's going to win a trip to SummerSlam today, everybody.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  Now, they've got to look the part.  Yeah.  They've got to sound good.  Look good.  They had to come up with a wrestling name.  Yeah.  A gimmick.  And they're making believe they're wrestling you or E-Rock.  Yeah.  I think a couple people didn't get that.  And so I think one person wants to wrestle you, Opie.  Yeah.  But...  Well, I got the belt.  Yeah.  Of course they got the belt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But yes, and everybody's got a nice character name.  This is going to go really well.  I can feel it.  So let's bring out our first superstar, the Executive Decision. 
[02:34:30]  Wow.  There it is.  Oh, look at this.  I get it.  He's dressed in a business suit.  Looks very executive-like.  So he's the Executive Decision.  All right.  Stepping up to the mic.  How you doing?  Just in case you guys are tired of seeing thin people.  What?  Let's always get up with a joke.  Is his mic loud enough so he can really hear this bombing?  He's got to show a PowerPoint presentation. 
[02:35:00]  Well, I want to thank you guys for having me here today and understanding my time is valuable.  As you know, we have SummerSlam coming up August 17th, Canseco Fieldhouse.  But the reason why I'm here today is that now it's a change that's been taking place.  I don't know if you guys got the memo.  He's handing out the memo.  It's perfect.  It's okay.  I like Executive Decision here.  Thank you.  Bottom line, the reason why I'm here, like I said, is E-Rock and Sam have proven to be ineffective. 
[02:35:30]  So I'm announcing a change that's taking place.  Yeah.  I am the Executive Decision.  That's how you executive produce.  The Executive Decision has been made, and I am the Executive Decision.  I've been contracted to clean out the dead weight and improve the bottom line.  Were you sent over by Sirius? 
[02:36:00]  How many car crashes went off?  Like I said, the memo says there will be some changes taking place.  Although the bottom line is to increase their performance and get rid of their salary.  I've created a chart.  All right.  He's handing out charts now.  He's got charts.  Oh, this is great. 
[02:36:30]  And ladies and gentlemen, just so you know, I'm not completely black-hearted.  I brought a little something for E-Rock and Sam.  They're pink slips.  Oh, wow.  That's it.  He's handing out the pink slips.  An Executive Decision has been made.  Yes.  Wow.  That sounds like office stuff.  And I brought enough for everyone as well.  Oh, wow.  He's got a lot of pink slips.  Hey, Shane, what does an F mean as you're judging there?  Boom! 
[02:37:00]  Can I see the pink slips on?  I can't like the pink slips.  The ideas are interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the enthusiasm is amazing.  Can't take it down a notch.  Jim, you'll see a comment section in case you have any disagreements with the pink slip.  All right.  Ooh.  I like how he had some memos.  He had some props, some memos, and charts.  He's in the suit.  It's definitely a character.  I mean, he's Executive Decision.  He's got a name.  But the problem is, as you sit there and think, imagine how many people are turning off their radios right now. 
[02:37:30]  Multiply that by 5,000 because it's television.  Yeah, it's true.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  Executive Decision.  Thank you.  Why don't you yell at us?  We'll keep you in line.  Why don't you yell at us?  Let's pop a score of energy.  I understand.  Oh, Jimmy's giving us some, you know, wanting to yell a little.  Well, yeah, because the wrestlers are usually kind of like a high energy thing.  Exactly.  And like I said, this is my first day on the job. 
[02:38:00]  I'm going to clean out the company.  And the Executive Decision has been made.  Oh!  Nice job.  Check it out.  That's what he needed.  An outline like that.  And now get out of his way.  That was good.  You know something?  I kind of like Executive Decision.  Well, let's go to Shane.  Shane?  What are some interesting concepts there?  You know, number one, it is tough.  I, for one, am extremely nervous in front of crowds.  But for someone getting up there, you know, their first time, you've got to give some props here.  This is not an easy environment coming in. 
[02:38:30]  So there's some good ideas.  We'll have to see what the Executive Decision will be at the end of the contest.  He did stand and words did come out.  I've got to ask Shane.  Now, you guys obviously see a lot of tapes of guys that want to be wrestlers, right?  Oh, yeah.  Do you have one that you can talk about that went around the office as the big joke?  Oh, there's a few.  Where you're like, come on, come on.  You've got to see this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just like, you know, some of the writers and all the other stuff they get because they get so many things.  They're like, dude, you've got to see this. 
[02:39:00]  You know, and then just leave it up on a loop, you know, like during lunch and every time you walk in there.  But it's motivational.  The great thing about it is at the end of the day, everyone's just so, you know, we're wonderful.  You know, it's so wonderful to have because they're so passionate about everything.  And it's just like, that's cool.  So you get, you know, you get that vibe off it.  But some are just downright hysterical.  So bad.  Yeah.  That's great.  Awesome.  Sam, who's next?  Well, unfortunately, Mr. OB City, who is going to be E-Rock's opponent, no-showed.  So we're going to go straight to Striker. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  William?  Striker.  Striker.  Is it going to be sitting worth playing on the disc?  Here comes Striker, a little lightning bolt on his shirt.  Got kind of a flat top haircut.  Wow.  Striker, he's dressed like Tom Likus.  Shazam.  Remember him?  Yeah, a little out.  He's wearing some sunglasses.  Striker.  Striker.  Yeah.  And for everybody who watched the news this morning, I'm sure you've all been warned. 
[02:40:00]  Because Jill Nicolini was on the air and she was doing the weather and pointed right to New York City and said,  lightning's going to strike.  And that's exactly what's happening today because I am here in the studio.  She does traffic.  She doesn't do the weather.  She does fucking traffic.  She does everything on that show, but it doesn't matter because she sent the message to all of you to let you know that Striker was going to be here.  Jill's a personal friend of mine.  And she warned everybody who watched that show that Striker will be here. 
[02:40:30]  And I'm going to give all of you a reason to believe that I'm the next best thing in the WWE.  See, for those who don't know, a reason to believe is what I like to call my finisher move.  Oh.  All of you are going to get a reason to believe that Striker is going to be on top of this business.  When you eat the cracker, finish up his face, in that circle.  Well, you know, I didn't come empty-handed because I got a ticket for all of you to the gun show, but it's a one-way.  It's a one-way ticket because these... 
[02:41:00]  It's a one-way ticket because these guns are so deadly, there ain't no coming back on the ride home.  I didn't know Mike Birbiglia was trying out.  So that's all right, because SummerSlam, I am the best-kept secret, and at SummerSlam, August 17th, the secret's out.  The secret's out.  Another little catchphrase. 
[02:41:30]  Let's give it up for Striker!  Striker.  You did pretty good.  What do you think, Shane?  Well, did you guys...  Hold on, Striker, you've got to come back in here for...  Where's Striker?  Striker, you've got to come back in.  Hold on, man.  Striker doesn't take direction very well.  Did you guys notice the lightning bolt down...  Is that a lightning bolt also?  Yeah, that's a lightning bolt.  On your calf tattoo?  Yeah, that symbolizes Striker.  That thing's sweet.  Wow, all right.  Nice to meet you.  How are you doing, man?  Nice to meet you, Shane.  So you're trying to say he was Striker before this...  Oh, he's great. 
[02:42:00]  This is the real deal.  I mean, this guy's taking all...  You just didn't get that tattoo, right?  This has been a character building inside you for quite some time.  Since I was eight years old.  There it is.  Striker.  The electricity is flowing.  Every day.  Every day.  See, now you're getting good.  Now you're getting into it.  The juice is flowing now.  The juice is flowing.  The electricity is flowing through these veins.  Lightning will strike.  Hopefully it won't strike twice.  Well, he's been flowing through it.  Well, yeah.  Well, he was loud. 
[02:42:30]  You had, like, a lot of energy to you.  Yeah, but I have a problem.  Sam, isn't there a Striker in the WWE already?  Yeah, Matt Striker.  Yeah, see, you know, I got a little problem with that, actually, too.  Because I've been following Matt Striker when he was in ROH.  And in ROH, he spelled it S-T-R-Y-K-E-R.  Now in the WWE, it's with an I.  Why?  I spelled it with a Y.  It's been my name my whole life.  So if I ever get the opportunity to go one-on-one with Matt Striker, him and I are going to have a ladder match with a contract to that name.  Because there's only room for one Striker in the WWE. 
[02:43:00]  Say this is he's getting better.  Now he's going.  You just got to be passionate about him, feeling him.  Yeah.  But if you're using the same name and spelling it differently, if you were onto the Giant with a J, it's not like you're the same guy.  You have to have your own name.  That's what I'm saying.  There's something fishy about the name Striker.  He's changing the spelling twice.  In ROH, it was spelled differently.  His has probably got a TM after it, unlike yours. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Let's hear it for Joel.  Thank you.  All right.  There goes Striker.  There goes Striker.  She just dropped the asshole.  And then he says she does everything over there.  Close personal friend.  He doesn't know she's never done the weather ever.  Never.  Well.  Okay.  Unfortunately, Flaming Douchefag also was a no-show today.  At least he picked a name. 
[02:44:00]  He doesn't have to worry about already being there in the WWE.  Flaming Douchefag.  So instead, we're going to go straight to our next superstar, Mouthwash Jones.  Wow.  All right.  Mouthwash Jones.  This is an interesting little twist.  How are you guys doing?  Mouthwash Jones is dressed very casually, just like, I don't know, a college student  or something.  Well, he has something.  What's that?  What's that behind your ear?  Oh, a toothbrush.  Sure.  It's a toothbrush behind his ear, and he's got a bottle of Scope or something, some mouthwash. 
[02:44:30]  I wish a Dwayne Reed for some mouthwash.  Okay.  Does the brand of mouthwash really matter?  You're looking for an endorsement deal already?  The guy wanted to save 40 cents on his character.  Yeah, right?  Couldn't even get the name brand mouthwash.  What can I say?  But I'm here for E-Rock, though.  Oh, now it's making sense.  Get E-Rock in here.  I'm here for E-Rock.  E-Rock, I want you to come up here.  I'm here for you, all right?  Please brush his teeth for everyone.  You know what?  Your halitosis breath is no match for me, okay? 
[02:45:00]  I will destroy you, okay?  And, you know...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wait, take one.  Get your thoughts together.  You're doing those yourself.  Okay.  Are you trying to say that you're starstruck by E-Rock?  Uh, no.  All right, good.  So...  I'm trying to say that he came in with a prop and no other material.  Well, let's see.  Let's get a do-over.  Let's get a do-over.  Yeah, do-over.  Compose yourself.  Get ready.  Get fired up.  My name is Mouthwash Jones, and I'm here for E-Rock. 
[02:45:30]  E-Rock, you're in trouble now because I am going to destroy you with my mouthwash.  That's all I have.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Well, let's see what E-Rock has.  E-Rock?  E-Rock?  I actually just came up here just to trash on E-Rock.  That's about it.  At least tell him to get on his knees and gargle.  E-Rock, what do you got for him?  Oh!  Wow.  E-Rock gargled with some of the Mouthwash and then spit it right in Mouthwash Jones' face. 
[02:46:00]  He just gave you some hairspray, Michael.  Wow.  What do you have to say about that?  Now you've got to think on your feet here.  That's right.  I guess so.  Well, you know what?  How about I stick this up your ass?  You might actually like it.  Whoa!  Back to E-Rock!  No, you didn't.  This is a violent show.  Let's see what E-Rock's got.  Why is it always gay?  Because that's what you like.  Whoa!  Go ahead, E.  You're saying wrestling's gay? 
[02:46:30]  No, I'm saying you're gay.  Oh!  He's got you.  Oh, this is good.  Stick it up my ass, huh?  Yeah.  I dare you.  Bend over.  I'm going to do it now.  Turn around.  Go ahead.  I will break you.  Go ahead.  Come on.  I must break you.  Take the first shot.  I dare you.  Go ahead.  See, now you're going to kiss me.  You just backed up.  You just backed away.  Yeah, because you can't kiss me.  Don't poke your lips.  I'm not sure I'd kiss you.  I'm not sure you would love me to kiss you.  Everyone saw it.  You puckered your lips.  You were quivering a little bit.  Don't you?  There'll be some fists flying soon.  Take a shot.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  See, you're doing it again. 
[02:47:00]  You're licking your lips and you're quivering.  I'm not quivering.  Come on.  You're speaking a really tough game.  I'm sorry.  What was that?  You're speaking a really tough game, but you're not backing it up.  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Turn around.  Wow.  Do it.  Don't make me.  I want to do it right now.  Why are you quivering?  Stop quivering.  You look like you're going to cry.  This is great.  People saying it's like a junior high fight.  Come on.  You're so tough.  Let's see you do it.  Take me down and try to shove that up my ass.  He's dead serious. 
[02:47:30]  This is awesome.  Oh, yeah.  He probably wants it.  It's getting serious.  You want to do it?  What, you want to go?  Or you want to save it for SummerSlam?  I want to save it for SummerSlam.  Good out, guys.  Yeah, that was a good out.  Boo.  Boo.  People commenting saying,  Iraq has a huge weight advantage over a brontosaurus.  That was magic.  Yeah, that was.  But honestly, yeah, I just wanted to come here to try to bash Iraq,  and I failed miserably.  You did get it, bro. 
[02:48:00]  What's your name again?  It's Mouthwash Jones.  Mouthwash Jones.  What do you got there on our mouthwash there, Shane?  Well, first to say hi.  How you doing?  Nice to meet you.  He really got into it, you know, once you get face-to-face with Iraq, you know,  but I got to say, you know, Iraq pulled your punk card.  You know, he just left it out there, and, you know, he didn't do anything about it.  What can I say?  I guess I got a little nervous.  Yeah.  Sorry.  All right there.  Mouthwash.  Take your toothbrush and your mouthwash and... 
[02:48:30]  Beat it.  Yes.  Get the bricks.  There you go.  All right.  We got a trip to SummerSlam.  Who's next there, Sam?  Well, that trip to SummerSlam just might go to...  Type A.  Type A.  Type A.  Awesome.  Type A.  Okay.  That's cool.  SummerSlam live on pay-per-view Sunday, August 17th, 8 p.m.  Yes.  He just slammed in the doors wearing a suit.  Another man in a suit.  First of all, I want to say F the executive decision for stealing my gimmick.  Nice.  I like that. 
[02:49:00]  Mr. Nagel.  You know, Mr. Nagel, I don't think you're ready for the pain that you're going to experience  when you step into the ring with Type A.  You see, you may think you know what suffering is because you had a near-death experience trying  to swallow some cinnamon, but I can assure you, Mr. Nagel, that was nothing compared to what  I'm going to do to you.  You see, Mr. Nagel, I am what we call in the corporate world a winner, a self-starter. 
[02:49:30]  I'm the first one in the office, and I'm the last one to leave.  Type A gets the job done.  But you, Mr. Nagel, you're a slacker.  You're the worst excuse for a radio producer that I've ever heard.  Each and every day, the ball slips through your mayo-greased fingers and hits the floor  of the Opie and Anthony Studios.  You're a joke, Mr. Nagel.  Even those who work under you laugh at you. 
[02:50:00]  You're a disgrace to everyone in your profession.  He's done his homework.  You make radio a dirty word, Mr. Nagel.  And now, I'm going to make you pay.  It's time to dance with the A-man.  Mr. Nagel, you're about to experience Type A.  May God have mercy on your soul.  Booyah!  Holy Jesus! 
[02:50:30]  Wow, Type A.  Wow, wow.  What do you have to say about that, E-Rock?  Wow.  I'd say this is the winner.  Wow.  Geez.  There's still a couple of poor saps out there that have to do this.  They're not topping this.  Wow.  This is good.  That Type A is a good character.  Tremendous.  I like it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've been watching this stuff since I was like a kid.  I've been obsessed with wrestling.  You know, it's awesome.  Having to come in on the heels of somebody else, having the suit, it was a little rough. 
[02:51:00]  But wow, did you really come to the table there, Type A. I like the old Type A thing.  The men's warehouse couldn't believe we sold two size sticky jackets.  I was going to be Type A Diabetes originally, but then I realized I'm a fat guy, so it would  be a little silly coming in and making fat jokes about E-Rock.  Of course not.  Type A personality is very good.  He's been obsessed with wrestling his whole life, except for the workout regime.  Oh, yeah.  Type A, right on, man. 
[02:51:30]  Well, Type A.  Remember that, man.  The crowd seems to like him.  I'll say hi again.  Hey, there you go.  Thanks, Shane.  Nice to see you again.  The crowd seems to like Type A.  Thanks, Shane.  I actually ran into Type A downstairs.  Oh, you did, huh?  Yeah, on my way up.  That's great.  Great.  Congrats.  He was fantastic, obviously.  Yeah, very good.  You know, he had very relevant material.  I won't go into it until we see everybody else, and some of the things I could say can,  you know, affect the next couple performers coming up here.  You know, they're little trade secrets, but Type A, if you follow that model, that was 
[02:52:00]  right on.  Yeah, that was.  Very good.  Before you, I got to go, so good luck.  No way!  Where the hell are you going?  I just got to go down to the thing.  I'll see you guys.  You got to get your nose fixed, right?  Jimmy, good luck, Jimmy.  I'll be good.  I'll see you guys.  All right.  Don't be scared.  Don't be scared.  I'm fine.  I'll bring you a little Mylar, get well soon balloon.  There goes Jim Norton.  I hope a nurse smothers him.  I hope a male nurse just puts a pillow over his face. 
[02:52:30]  He's getting a little nose surgery today there.  Yeah.  A little nose job.  He's got a deviated septum?  Ah, nose job.  Nose job?  Because he's going Hollywood on us.  He needs to get the nose.  Yeah.  Sam, what do you got?  Get ready for electricity, people.  Yeah.  Because here comes the ultimate warrior.  Okay.  A little play on words, I guess, from the ultimate warrior.  He does have things around his arms.  All right.  Relax, Scoopin.  First of all, I'm the ultimate warrior. 
[02:53:00]  I hail from parts unknown in New Jersey.  I've been listening to the radio for the last few weeks, and all I've been hearing is primetime  Sam Roberts.  He happened his gums.  Primetime.  Have you even reached puberty yet?  Your name should be Dateline.  Hey, Dateline.  I'll be more of a man than you'll ever be.  I eat steak, rice, and the coochie.  I know the struggle, brother.  He's doing his Rich Voss impression.  It's like an ultimate warrior meets Rich Voss thing. 
[02:53:30]  That's the visual.  You may be asking yourself, what am I going to do if I step into the ring with this maniac?  Well, here's the thing, okay?  You're going to step onto the ring apron, and then you're going to slip because of the puddle  of saliva that I left there.  And then I'm going to grab you by your afro and twirl you around and spin you like a  dreidel.  And then, for my finishing move, I'm going to put my finger behind my ear and give you  the stink finger, and you'll be out for the one, two, three. 
[02:54:00]  The awe is never good.  I pop my balloon mortgage, and I'm cashing in my money in the bank, and I'm such a nice  guy, I'm letting you pick a day where you can challenge me.  You can find me either August 22nd or 23rd at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  A little plug like Rich.  Very good.  I've got the power of all my warriors behind me, and I feel their energy coursing through  my veins.  Veins which haven't had drinks or drugs in them for 22 years, 10 months, 6 weeks, and 2 days. 
[02:54:30]  Thanks, thank you, I appreciate it, folks.  Okay?  So, get ready, prime time.  I mean, dateline, I stink.  For the ultimate warrior.  Alright, not bad.  Not bad at all, actually.  Shane?  It's good effort.  He was doing a little boss there, though.  There was some inside stuff there that was pretty good.  That's some good effort, good effort. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Very good, bro.  Cool.  Nice seeing you guys.  Take care, man.  Not bad.  I said I had him earlier.  Our next superstar about to enter the ring is Jabby Just Got Up.  The full mask.  The full mask.  Who's got the full mask?  Oh, yeah.  This is, uh...  It's really loud out there.  Wow, he's wearing, like, um...  Sweet. 
[02:55:30]  Pac-Man?  Pac-Man, uh...  Hey, guys.  ...pajama pants, a Homer Simpson slippers, a black shirt, a blue cape, and a blue and gold  mask with an M on it.  Ooh.  This is my blanket.  Oh.  He's Jabby Just Got Up.  What time is it?  Jabby Just Got Up.  Okay.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Hey, Sam.  Listen, it's...  Oh.  I slept so late last night. 
[02:56:00]  Uh...  I'll...  I'll...  I'll...  I'll talk to you later.  I gotta get back to sleep.  Can I go take a nap?  He's, um...  Woo!  Pretty interesting character that, um...  By interesting, I mean...  I don't...  See, he just got up.  Yeah, I know.  I get it.  I get the name.  Right.  Jabby Just Got Up.  Is that it?  Is that it?  That's it. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know.  He went back to sleep because he was tired because he just got up.  No, I get the concept.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right, Jabby.  I had high hopes for this one, actually.  I was just like, wow.  He came out, you know, full regalia, and especially the Homer Simpson slippers.  And now he's asleep on the couch.  That's it.  He had nothing.  He's still in character, though, if you'll notice.  Everybody else, when their promo was over, they dropped character.  Jabby Just Got Up is still pretending to be asleep on the couch.  What do you have, like...  You have, like, $5 on the side with this guy? 
[02:57:00]  I just like the character.  Could he really be asleep?  He could be, along with our listeners.  Yeah, before he puts the rest of the audience to sleep, let's get to the last contestant.  Yes.  Our final contestant is Matt Massacre.  Matt Massacre.  Oh, no.  I think I know who this could be.  Hurry up.  Matt Massacre.  Oh, boy.  Let me finish getting in character.  Getting in character. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Looks like kind of a gangbanger.  Yeah, looks like a gangbanger.  Matt Massacre.  Fucking right.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, it's Flea Man.  Because it's Flea Man.  Yo, E-Rock.  Name's Matt Massacre.  That's who I am.  E-Rock, he needs you to look at him.  Hey, man.  What the hell are you doing?  This is a promo.  You gotta look at me face to face.  You're performing for the audience, not for E-Rock. 
[02:58:00]  That's for the audience.  Yo, E-Rock.  Listen, I'm Matt Massacre.  That's who I am.  I'm throwing out a challenge to get you to SummerSlam.  Eric Nagel's the guy.  Hawk thinks he can fly.  30-inch thighs.  Getting to work late and he lies.  Eating all the mayo.  Looks like Pillsbury dough.  Yo, he didn't know.  I shoot him off like a bow.  Fuck it.  Oh, boo.  Boo.  That's fine.  Shoot him off like a bow.  Try to pick a 20th century weapon. 
[02:58:30]  That's low.  Keep it going.  Oh, you want me to?  Yeah.  Finish it at least.  For the laugh factor, yeah.  Yo, I'm not a cheap M&M.  I'm an expensive vanilla ice.  Did E-Rock's mom today?  Not once but twice.  And when I left the house, I had crabs and lice.  She tried to satisfy my mom, but he's small like mice.  Too bad he's so small.  At least my tongue is nice.  Maybe he should get a sex change and call himself Eric Spice.  Okay.  Wow. 
[02:59:00]  How do you think?  Taken down.  Taken down.  And it's E-Rock.  From behind, E-Rock.  Takes him down.  On the ground.  Wow.  And taps him out.  E-Rock's off the ground today.  Holy shit.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, good stuff right there, man.  Thanks.  E-Rock took him right down.  Yeah, hard, too.  Oof.  Hey, can you tell Jabby just got up that, you know, it's over and we want our studio back? 
[02:59:30]  He's still sleeping over there.  Jabby, get the fuck out.  Hey, Matt, Matt, I have a question.  Going back to your rhyme a little bit, you know, did you, even though you were trying to  insult E-Rock, you know, having, you know, small genitalia, you were still inferring that  he was banging your mom, isn't that correct?  Did you have that in there?  So that's okay with you?  No, I think you said he used to.  I said he tried to.  Oh, he tried to.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you said he couldn't satisfy her, meaning that he inserted. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, instead.  He put it in.  All right, so that's cool.  So he still banged your mom.  Yeah.  So that's like he, that's brutal.  Boy, quite a insult.  I mean, so E-Rock wins just right off that bat, right there.  Yeah.  He banged your mom.  How are you going to trump that?  I already said that I did.  You banged your mom?  I did it not once.  I did it.  No, I banged his not once, but twice.  Yeah, but he banged your mom and just banged her, and you said in your rap that you banged  his mom and ended up with crabs.  And lice.  Right, so he still wins. 
[03:00:30]  Because he doesn't have any venereal diseases.  Sweet.  And he took you down and made you tap out.  Yep.  Wow, that was heinous.  I assume you guys may know each other.  Yeah.  Flea Man is known to many as a, well, just a dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why is he still standing there?  Have any pieces of peace out?  Let's hear it for Flea Man.  Good job, Flea Man.  Give something.  Good deal, man.  Wow, a tough decision, huh? 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  Got a real tough decision here.  Is that it?  That's it.  That's the contest, everyone.  Wow, wow.  Awesome.  I thought Eastside Dave would give us a little surprise thing today.  Where is he?  Does he have his wrestling stuff today?  Yeah, usually Eastside Dave is very good at it, at least as an exhibition, I would think.  Well, why don't we do this?  Shane, what time do we have you, Tal?  Whatever.  I'm good.  All right, good.  Can we take a quick break, and then we'll announce the winner?  Sure.  And then we'll tabulate the scores.  That's it.  For the trip to SummerSlam, live on Pay-Per-View, a week from Sunday at 8 p.m., you got the 
[03:01:30]  Hell in the Cell match with Edge and The Undertaker.  The world title, CM Punk versus JBL.  We love JBL, by the way.  It's tremendous.  We had to give him a talking to the last time he was in here with that boner juice he was  trying.  Mama Joanna?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have you guys tried it?  No.  No.  We didn't, right?  God bless him for trying, but we're like, what are you doing?  You don't need a boner juice.  WWE title, you got Triple H and the great Khali.  Khali, I'm sorry.

It's, who else is leaving early?  Jim left for surgery  Remember him, Jim Norton?  Jimmy, Jimmy was looking a little weak  He hasn't eaten in like 18 hours  And it was starting  Yeah  It was starting to be noticeable the last hour or two  Tomorrow's my grandma's 85th birthday  So I have to go to Detroit today  Really?  Yeah 
[03:04:30]  The black side of Detroit?  I don't know yet  Do you think he's blockchain?  I don't know  Come on  Yeah, we were trying to figure it out  Hey, wouldn't this be like a good wrestling character?  Trying to figure this out?  He, uh, you know he's related to Thomas Jefferson, right?  Swear to God  Really?  That's cool  For real  Yep  And Jefferson has been known, you know  It's come out in recent history  Right  That consort  Right  Yeah  And he kind of has some of those features happening  But he's not willing to admit it yet 
[03:05:00]  Well, there's no, uh, evidence in the family tree of any black family members  What does your grandma look like?  Like an old white lady  Mm-hmm  A couple of my uncles have the, uh, curly hair  No, on her side  My mom's side  See, that's not curly hair you have  Yeah  It's a type of hair that, uh, almost got Imus, uh, fired  Right  Yeah, they're talking about  Right  You got that type of hair  But you're very pale  Yeah  Oh, true  Drew, what do you think? 
[03:05:30]  He's definitely black  Definitely  Got some, uh, brother in him  I mean, a little bit, but it's in there, right?  It's in there  Yeah, you got a little black there  Drew's light too, though  Not, yeah  Yeah, but my, my hair is obviously nappy  See, he can say it  See, that's how it works  He can say it  But, you know, Sam's hair is close to my brother's hair  And my brother's black  Yeah  So Sam's definitely got to be in there somewhere  Yeah  I'm telling you, you're adopted  No, I'm not adopted  I mean, I got a birth certificate and baby pictures 
[03:06:00]  By the way, your brother  And pork chops for earlobes  Your brother looks  What do I mean?  Your brother looks blacker than you  Really?  Mm-hmm  He's got looser hair than me, though  He's got the, you know  It's curly  Yeah  It is curly  All right, why don't we get a winner?  My prime time  This is your baby  Uh, E-Rock reminded me  Because these guys love busting on each other  It's unbelievable  But E-Rock reminded me that Sam has his wrestling chair  That needs to be signed  Yeah, well, I mean, that's some, you know  Has Shane ever signed your wrestling chair? 
[03:06:30]  No, Shane hasn't  I mean, usually that's, you know, off the air or something  Cool  No, it's not, Shane  Do I get to hit you with it when I'm finished?  Sure  It'd be an honor  Makes a distinctive sound  It certainly does  Every time a wrestler comes in  Shane, um, Shane, uh, Sam gets this chair signed  All right  You guys, yeah  Where are you going to sign?  Next to who?  I don't know  Where's Triple H?  I'm going to sign over him  Triple H is right up here  Look at how happy Sam is 
[03:07:00]  This is great  Shane McMahon on the chair is a huge plus  Is it?  You can't just go to an autograph signing and get Shane McMahon  What the hell are you going to do with this chair?  Put it on my wall or something  Thank you very much, Shane  My pleasure  I hope, I hope as soon as you walk out of the studio today  It starts raining  I wrap it up in plastic bags  Yeah, I'm sure you do  You didn't have to, you know, explain that it's not going to get wet  Just go with laughter  That's like the official  Would you just go to Home Depot? 
[03:07:30]  That's what we normally do  We just go to Home Depot, buy chairs in bulk  And really  Sometimes you sit in them  And other times you whack each other in the head with it  Yeah, I just went to Staples and got a chair  And started asking people to sign it  There it is, cool  And look at it now  It's so industrious  Yeah  I've been getting into  They got Madison Square Garden Classic or whatever the hell  MSG Classic  And they're running the old matches  Yeah, the old school  That took for fucking ever  But a lot of fun to watch  It was so simple  Yeah, it's so simple  Well, it brings you back to your youth  I mean, that's one of the things  You're traveling around the world 
[03:08:00]  And we've been in business for so long now  That it's just great  Because everybody has, you know  Quote, a wrestling story  You know, they remember their grandmother sitting down  Or their grandfather  Or their dad  Or when I was a kid  Or, you know, so many conversations happen that way  But I love, you know, the old school  Because it does bring you back to when you were a kid  Like Putzki and San Martino  I do Putzki  Yeah, yeah  That's it  Chief J Strongbow  Bobo Brazil  You know, you go  Go away  Superstar Billy Graham  You know, that's their  I love that  You know  Yeah, those matches  They just go on and on 
[03:08:30]  One of your old guys there went kind of nuts though  Which one?  Jesse Ventura  We had him on the show  He's cuckoo  Yeah  He's cuckoo  I gotta say it  He's living in like Baja  He like splits his time a little bit  He's told me he's got a place down in Baja  Everything's like solar energy  He doesn't have to worry about electricity or anything  I was like, that's cool  Yeah  He's starting to believe in all kinds of weird conspiracy things  And we talked to him about that  It got a little intense  Did it?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah  He thinks  He told us we have to sleep sometime 
[03:09:00]  Yeah  He was not happy with us  I was a Navy SEAL  Oh, you know  And you're gonna have to sleep sometime  Because I'm gonna  And we're like, well  Are you threatening  Are you gonna kill us?  Are you threatening us?  Is Jesse Ventura gonna like slit my throat  With a Rambo knife or some shit?  Yeah  And the other thing I wanted to mention really fast was  Morgan Spurlock did a documentary  Where the Hell is Obama?  Or Osama?  Wow  What are you Fox News now? 
[03:09:30]  Wow  And the one thing that came across during this documentary  Was that you got a lot of fans in the Middle East  Oh, yeah  It's unbelievable  He was walking into homes in Afghanistan  And all these like really scary  You would never go there places  And they're watching wrestling  Right  And they're walking around with the wrestling merchandise and everything  Yeah  Hence world wrestling entertainment  Right  Hence world  So no way  I mean we have a huge benefit  We're really all over the place  In over 150 different countries 
[03:10:00]  The product is seen  You know, just everywhere  Yeah  And one of the keys to success is  It's easy to follow  The rules are not difficult  You know, it's one, two, three  It's always the protagonist versus the antagonist  And then, you know, usually  You know, you're fighting from underneath  So if you hit mute  You know, you don't need to sound anywhere else  If you hit mute  You can normally tell  Like who's fighting from underneath  You know, the classic Shakespearean style  So, yeah, it's a blast, man  Awesome  We just broke into China  It's sick  Really?  Yeah, it's great  Have you been to China?  Yes, several times  What do you think of it? 
[03:10:30]  It's, essentially  The food's interesting  You know, it depends on where you go  It's weird when, you know  Wait, wait  Why is the food interesting?  Well, I was going to get there  You know, you're sitting in a meeting  And, you know, usually they're at lunch meetings  Everybody's smoking  I mean, the room is so full of smoke  It's just, it's like brutal  And then, everything's on the Lazy Susan  So, it always comes around  And then every, like, half the food is looking at you  You know, and you're just like  You see all these, like, boiled birds  You know, with the blue eyes  And you're just like 
[03:11:00]  Oh, I'm out of pass  You know, give me some type of meat-looking product  You know, but you don't know what that is  So, in the very authentic areas  Which you need to go to business  The hotels are great  You know, that's all normal food  Right, right  Food's brutal  How are the people?  Are they happy over there, in general?  Yeah  People walking around the streets  Not the ones you're meeting with, of course  Seem to be  Well, that'll open up China  To a whole new thing  Yeah, they're loving it  Yeah, they're loving it  I bet  That's cool  You know, we'll see  You know, after the Olympics are over 
[03:11:30]  We're going to tour there  And we'll let those guys kind of figure out  All the loopholes right now  Mm-hmm  Very cool  Let's say hi to  Who's this from Bronxville?  This is Todd  Hey, Todd, go ahead  Hey, Shane  I was just wondering  What WWE's problem is  With the macho man Randy Savage  Problem?  What do you mean?  He's a legend  I mean, Vince apparently  Has denied production of a Savage DVD  And he hasn't gone on the Hall of Fame 
[03:12:00]  And I've heard rumors  That there's some bad blood  I was just wondering  You know  What do you know about that?  Not a whole lot  I guess I'll take it up with the chairman  But I'll look into it for you  Yeah, because we want Savage  In the Hall of Fame  Ooh, yeah  Okay  Macho madness continues  It certainly does  You've got to give us something today  So we make all the wrestling sites  You guys are good at  Helping us get our names out there  You guys always admit something  On our show  And then it's like  Blam, it's on every wrestling site  Give us a little something  I don't know  I'm going to think of all that 
[03:12:30]  Give us some controversy  Sam  What could you help us out with today?  Well, maybe like  How come  Freddie Prinze Jr. got hired  As a writer?  Well, A, he's a producer  And it really started  You know  Which would be similar to you  If you joined  An enormous fan  Freddie Prinze Jr. has been a fan forever  Is thoroughly, you know  Engaged in the product  Really enjoys it  And has a lot of energy  So we'll see  You know, hopefully it'll all work out  So he's 
[03:13:00]  He's only been there a couple weeks  Didn't know that  You should see how much energy I have  A lot  Well  One day you might show it  And Shane, that's why I was laughing  Because he's convinced  He should have had  You know, gotten that gig  Well, I mean  I'm in the media  Freddie Prinze Jr. is in the media  Whoa, whoa, whoa  Right?  Well, he hasn't done a movie  In a long time  You're barely in the media  But I'm kind of  Kind of  You're kind of in the media  Yeah  And, you know  We're both big fans  We're both creative people  Right  You do a segment called 
[03:13:30]  What's the Haps  It's hugely  It's hugely popular though, right?  It is  It's very popular  What's the Haps  Don't you have an A.J. Poopy shits  Around here, too?  Oh, boy  You might not want to  Debut that character  Didn't realize that was  Going to go on right now  All right  Come on, man  You're trying to impress Shane  This is a character, Shane  That's  Sam Roberts does  That's tremendous  Oh, yeah  This is going to be wonderful  Unexpected  He does  He does  Look at him sweating  Oh, wow  He does Hollywood Updates  And his character is 
[03:14:00]  A.J. Poopy shits  Listen to how good  He does his character  Almost like he knows  A little bit  Too much  What's up, y'all?  A.J. Poopy shits  Back here with the  O&A Hollywood Update  For dudes  Let's take a look  At what's going on  With all the hot chicks  In La La Land  Well  The latest news  To come out of  Lohanville  Is that Lindsay  And her gal pal DJ  Samantha Ronson  Are officially  An all-girl couple  At first  It makes you be like  Damn 
[03:14:30]  I guess that means  Lindsay Lohan  Is not banging  Any more dudes  Like me  But then you go  Hey  Remember what they say  There's plenty  There's plenty of fish  In the sea  And by fish  I mean tips  In Amazonian woman news  Big Brooke Hogan  Is being courted  By Playboy  To do a naked pictorial  A lot of people  Think she's too much  Of a brutish thing  To do Playboy  But as far as  I'm concerned  There is nothing wrong  With a big girl  And I've got two words  Why  Junk in the trunk  I mean 
[03:15:00]  Who doesn't like  A great set of broad shoulders  And besides all that  Even if she is  Six foot ten  If you keep looking up  Eventually you'll find  A set of tips  On any great chick  Apparently  Britney Spears  Has a new dude  In her life  She's been caught  By the pop-o photogs  With some former  Israeli soldier  Named Lee  I just hope  He treats her right  Because that girl  Has got to get  Back on track  Britney is well  On her way  To being the charismatic  Tour de force  Singing machine  That we all know 
[03:15:30]  And miss  And I mean for real  What's better  On a hot chick  Than a sparkling personality  Other than a pair  Of tits that is  Pamela Anderson  Has a new reality show  And it just goes to prove  Some chicks  Really do get better  With age  After all these years  She totally  Hasn't missed a step  Seeing her now  Brings me right back  To when I used to wonder  What it must have been like  To be with Tommy Lee  I mean  Anyone dope enough  To score chicks  Like Pam Anderson  Must be totally bossed 
[03:16:00]  To knock back  A couple of brews  With  Have you seen  The tits on her  I mean come on  And finally  Miley Cyrus  Has been back  In the news  As more photos  Of her have been  Popping up  Wearing next to nothing  Now  Before we go  Any further  You should know  No matter how  Hot a chick is  AJ Poopy shits  Don't get down  With no kids  Word is bond  But I'll tell you this  Give her a couple years  And I'll bet  She'll have a  Smoking bond  Hopefully she'll end up 
[03:16:30]  With someone  Who's as hot as she is  Like Zac Efron  If there's one guy  Who likes chicks  With tits  Like AJ  Likes chicks  With tits  It's Zac Efron  That's it for me players  Thanks for listening to the  ONA Hollywood Update  For dudes  With AJ Poopy shits  And remember  When it comes to  Hollywood news  AJ's got your back  And front  If you're a chick  That is  Peace out  That was great  I'm just curious 
[03:17:00]  On the name  No  I mean  AJ Poopy shits  Kind of  What's up with the name  Well shits  Is spelled  S-C-H-I-T-Z  Yeah  Get your mind  In the gutter  It's like lip shits  Right  Poopy shits  Poopy shits  Yeah  And AJ  And he loves chicks  And their tits  Well he certainly does  Because he just mentions  It all the time  Yeah  I mean very entertaining  You know I would recommend  You change the name  The character could take off  Yeah  Whoa 
[03:17:30]  Look at that  I agree  I was thinking about  Changing the name  Just now too  To what  Sam Roberts  No  Again  Think about  You can use the celebrity  Of everything that you're doing here  And then you can have  Actual real life  You know  With Pam Anderson  And all that other stuff  It becomes a character  And then you guess what  You get to be looking  You know  At their tits  And all the other things  You be like  Look this is all about boobs  Right  You know  Then think of the  You know  The line of women  You can have all there  Because they want to be with you  And this is a good thing  This is a good gimmick 
[03:18:00]  Shane  Sam is thinking right now  Sam right now  Is thinking  If I could speak for Sam  Mind your own business  No that's not what I was thinking  Shane  Anthony said  Sam was  That's kind of what you said  Before Shane got here  Nope  Nope  You know  Opie and Anthony  They're shock jocks  And they say shocking things sometimes  But that's not what I was thinking  I can do Shane's job like that  No  That's not what I was saying  I'm going to clam up now  And just be quiet  Please don't  That was uncomfortable  Yeah I'm hurt  I wish you wouldn't be  Alright  We got another question for Shane 
[03:18:30]  As we try to like  Make all the wrestling websites today  We're being honest  We need something  That's going to take off today  Well you could be at www.com  You could be on there  That's probably the biggest one around  We want that gossip thing  And then it takes off  Oh my god  Did you hear  Shane on Opie and Anthony today  I guess you could ask questions  So yeah  Alright let's see  Chris in Dallas  Hey Shane  I just got a couple questions  How you doing?  Can I have you?  Number one  Do you know what's going on  With Randy Orton  And his collarbone injury 
[03:19:00]  Because I've heard conflicting reports  On what you do back  Yes I do  Actually Randy right now  Is in the United Kingdom  His collarbone injury  Is healing very well  He's doing a promotional tour  Over there for us right now  Okay  And then the second one was  I've heard reports  That Bruno Sammartino  Really hates Vince McMahon  So anything about that?  That's probably accurate  Oh wow  That's probably accurate  That goes back a long long long way  I don't know 
[03:19:30]  I haven't talked to Bruno  Since I was like six  So you know  It's been a while  Well Bruno was the man  When we were growing up  Watching wrestling  So what kind of problem  Where does  What kind of problem  Does he have with Vince?  I don't know  I think it's  I'll put you down  Alright thanks  I think it's a  I just think he's a little bitter  I've heard something like  He doesn't like the new style  Of wrestling or something like that  Right  He's more of an old school guy  Oh he's definitely  Matches took two and a half  Fucking hours  That's it  I mean  With various holds  That would last  For two minutes at a time 
[03:20:00]  Yep  But you can't  I mean you can't take anything away  From Bruno  From the standpoint  He was a legend  He was a champion  You know  What's more impressive  Being you know  A champion you know  Multiple times  Or being a champion  You know  For multiple years  You know one time  And Bruno just held it  You know  Especially here  And he just  He owned the Italian community  Here in New York specifically  And then I went up to Boston  To Philly  So you know  He was my grandfather's guy  You know  Just as you know  Hogan then became the next guy  And then Stone Cold and Rock  And now Triple H 
[03:20:30]  And Taker  And continue to go on  But yeah  So there's some rivalry  It goes back also  I think Bruno's a little upset  And this is going from memory  That his son David  Wasn't able to follow  In his footsteps  Things like  I believe it's David  So  Wow you don't even remember his name  That's all I got  That's all I got better  I guess it really didn't work out for him  If you don't remember his name  Jesus  I saw David at the New Rochelle High School  A couple years ago  Wrestling  He's pretty good  At the New Rochelle High School 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  In the gym  Yeah that's just like  Wrestling at Madison Square Garden  You want to rub it in  A little more  To the San Martino  Oh  That wasn't intended  San Martino family  All right  Questions are good  Yes yes  Let's go  I know  Keep them coming  Keep them coming  Let's see  Dave in Jersey  What's up  Hey guys  How's it going today  Good  Great  Shane I got a question for you  Okay  Because I've been in the business myself  Both sides of the curtain  Promoting and wrestling  And I know how hard it is 
[03:21:30]  To get guys over  With the fans  And I see the revolving door  Happening with the WWE  I have to call it F  I can't call it E  Okay  It's E  Get over it  I know  Are you guys having a hard time  Getting these newer guys  Over with the fans  Because it seems  The same guys  Keep coming back to the top  Whereas you get these guys in  It's like okay  Like Chris Harris  Out the door in two weeks  Are you finding it hard  To develop these new guys  To get over with the fans 
[03:22:00]  Seems like they got  Too many guys to work  Well we have tons  And we have lots of opportunities  Back in the day  I mean here's one of the  The huge differences  And since you're in the business  You can appreciate it  Back in the day  Everyone had much more  Of a skill set  So when you came  And that's when we had  All the different territories around  So if you worked  New York territory  Then you'd work  You know  Texas territory  Then you'd do California  And by that  Normally you'd always end in New York  By the time you hit New York  You were seasoned  You were ready to go 
[03:22:30]  And you were polishing  Your character down  It's like an actor  First starting off  Exactly  You know  As they get better  And better and better  Now that the territories  Are you know  Pretty much dissolved  It's much harder  To have that experience  And we are now  Recreating  We just opened  Our you know  Our center  Down in Florida  Down in Tampa  And that's hopefully  What we'll start doing  Getting back to  More of that local flavor  And all the other  Hard working independents  Out there  You know 
[03:23:00]  If there's a breakout star  And they really start  To build  And again  Have that it factor  Of what we were doing  Here earlier  Of the charisma  And everything else  That's how  Let me ask you  Sure just cut me off  Go ahead  You don't hear my answer  Go right ahead  Go right ahead  Go right ahead  It's Dave's show  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  We're just spectators  In your world  It's alright  Go ahead  Because one of the groups  That I ran  You know  On the indies  You can't believe  Everything you hear  I'm sure you know that  That somebody said 
[03:23:30]  Oh you guys  Are being looked at  You know  Shane was  You know  Considering coming down  He's sending somebody  From the offices  And I'm like  That's gotta be bullshit  We always look  So I don't know  This was a couple years ago  I was with a group  Called Cyberspace Wrestling  Okay  So I guess it was bullshit  Yeah because we used  A lot of guys from TNA  Like Jared  Abyss  Michael Shane  A couple of the girls  And you know  When somebody says something  You don't believe  Everything you hear  Right  So that was just 
[03:24:00]  My curiosity  Is like well  Was it something  That you  Were we a group  That you guys  Heard of  Or looked into  Even though it's been  A couple years ago  And nobody cares anymore  I don't think anybody  Cares now  I don't think anybody  Cares now  The name's not  Popping in my head  But we're always  Looking for talent  So all the independent  Shows and things like that  That's where we look  Alright  But it's not up to us  Just to finish it out  It is truly up to the  Fan base to  Make somebody popular  And we'll throw  Certain things out there  And the fans judge  You know 
[03:24:30]  We just react normally  To what the audience does  If they like somebody  If we're trying to push them  You know  Much more as a good guy  And they completely  You know  Go the opposite way  And that's what  Originally happened  With The Rock  You know  They regurgitated him  You know  Because he was so hokey  And good guy  And goody two shoes  And they puked on him  And he became  You know  We're just like  Alright let's take that  And turn it into an advantage  And just spin him  And then he was fantastic  And then he was off  To the races  I miss The Rock  He was just amazing  Just amazing  Doing his thing  Why don't we give  Give out the  Oh 
[03:25:00]  Pick  The winner  Well it was very difficult  We have like a top three  So at least some people  Could feel good about themselves  Today Shane  Or not really  Oof  Well I think  I think number one  Number one  The winner obviously  I think we'd all agree  Is Taipei  Yeah  Yeah  Why even  Taipei  Do you screw those  Why even screw around  He's got a trip to SummerSlam  Which is going to be on  Pay-per-view  A week from Sunday  Here's Taipei everyone  Taipei  Tremendous  Taipei 
[03:25:30]  Great job  That's actually a great point  You know not everyone  Gets to go to the  Sold out  Conseco Fieldhouse  In Indianapolis  But you can  You can watch it  On pay-per-view  That is a very good point  There Opie  Yeah  I remember the days  When he did pay-per-views  Once every three months  Now it's once every  What three days  Yeah  Three days  Three and a half  Three and a half  We're trying to spread it out  And it's like $50 now  Oh  Hey  Hey  Slow down Taipei  Alright let's get the  Runner up guy  To take your place  Pay-per-views 
[03:26:00]  Dramatically did go up  In the past ten years  It used to be about $20  Now it's $50  Where the thinking  Behind that was that  A lot of people  Get together and watch the event  It's the price of gas  That's it  I don't know  That's true  Okay  I'm not  I'm not  Well okay  You sound like  Bitching about it  No I wasn't  Bitching about it Shane  Of course not  I have a question  By the way for Shane  Hold on before we get there  Let's take  Is there  Can there be any more value  Of getting together  With your buddies  Watching a WWE  Pay-per-view  Amortizing the cost 
[03:26:30]  Since you are  Type A in the business aspect  Having a few beers  Relaxing  What is the price  Of entertainment  In today's world  Priceless  There it is  Tremendous  Absolutely  Alright what's your question  Okay  Most  You probably can't talk  A lot about  Like the current talent  But  Why  Most difficult  Maybe you can  I don't know  I want to know  What's the most  Difficult wrestler  To work with  Past or present  Ooh  Now we finally got  Difficult  Let's see  Difficult how  You mean  Just  A dick  Backstage 
[03:27:00]  Or was like  Selfish  You know  Prima donna  Yeah  You mean family members  Excluded  Or  You know  No one's usually  No one's usually  A dick  Or difficult  That way  Sometimes  You know  You work with someone  You know  Prior to them going out  Especially from a promo  Standpoint  And you're even  You know  You know  From a match standpoint  And you expect  One thing  And then  They don't deliver  And then you  Repeatedly try to do that  And then you  Obviously have to make  Changes 
[03:27:30]  But there's not  No like big egos  Backstage  There's enormous egos  I mean  You know  Placating those egos  And working around it  All the time  But that's  That's what makes  A talent great  If you don't have an ego  If you don't  If you're not sure  Of yourself  You're not going to  Translate in front of the camera  You're not going to  Translate in the fan base  Whose ego  Has gotten in the way  Of doing what you want  Them to do  You know  To do  I think  Well  You know  You can go back  In the day  And like I said  Everyone has to have  A healthy ego 
[03:28:00]  And sometimes  People start believing  You know  That they are  That character  People such as  Such as  You know  You know  You have a couple  In mind maybe  I don't know  Well you know  The  I  Well  Bret Hart of course  Is the one  Everyone  You know  Because of the whole  You know  Thing in Montreal  But  I don't know  I've heard stories  About that a lot  I heard like  Hogan was  You know  There was issues  With Hogan  And I don't know  Sam knows  Those people  Oh wow  Wait a minute  I don't believe 
[03:28:30]  All these rumors  I read on the internet  I get my facts  About Dine W  From Dine W  Dot com  Monday Night Raw  And Friday Night Smackdown  Cool  That's where I get  My information from  Even Shane wants to puke  At this point  All right  Type A  You got the trip  To SummerSlam  Great guys  Thanks a lot  And getting back to it  You know  Why do you win  Yeah  Type A won  Because you know  You had very relevant points  You came at  You were prepared  And it was meaningful 
[03:29:00]  You were articulate  And the main thing  Is you had a big finish  And that is one thing  Anytime you're cutting  What we call a promo  You always have to have  You know  What's your big finish  What is the ending message  That leaves everybody  Like wow  That was fantastic  Before they walk off camera  Or throw the mic down  You always have to have  You always have to have  The big finish  The big finish  So nice job  It was very very well done  Thanks man  Looking forward to SummerSlam  It's going to be awesome  Cool  When SummerSlam?  When is SummerSlam  It's August 17th 
[03:29:30]  Who doesn't know that  A week from this Sunday  Yeah  Oh cool  And you get to fly  With Sam and E-Rock  I believe  Yeah  How does that work  I mean  That's like  What a scam  That's going on  E-Rock and Sam  I think it's a scam  It's definitely a scam  What do you mean?  Last time we flew them out  To a wrestling event  They came home  Like a week later  I'm like  Are you guys ever  Coming back to work?  Yeah  Notice how they didn't  Win the trip last month  To Long Island  Oh  Oh let's go to  The Great American Bash  Well where is it?  Oh that's a long island  It was Wrestlemania 
[03:30:00]  And you had a little problem  With the pyrotechnics  Right  Everything worked out  In the end  So we had eyewitnesses there  And they're like  We have no idea  What you're talking about  Right  And it was on  Every news channel  Like that's the reason  Why you went to Wrestlemania  To give us some scoop  They were too busy  Eating the steak martinis  Or whatever the hell it was  I was reporting on E-Rock's diet  Yeah  That was the storyline  With the pyro  We just did that  To a few people  Of course  It was the great white moment  It was perfect  I know  I knew it was a work  Who could tell  At this point  It's so obvious 
[03:30:30]  Would you mind  Burning your retina  As you come in  Just to get a little  Extra publicity  Alright we want to thank  Shane McMahon  For stopping by  Thank you guys  It was a lot of fun  Absolutely  We are wrapping up the show  Got a new prospect  For the WWE  Type A  I'm sure we'll be seeing him  Very cool  Type A  Yeah  I would love to see him  Get in the ring  And just get smashed  Are you even going to mention  Who was in second?  There wasn't a second  After Type A  Who was he going to really have?  Wait Laszlo is actually judging?  Yeah I got numbers next to him 
[03:31:00]  Stryker may have to be number two  Yeah you like Stryker?  But we don't have a prize for number two  Why are we sending two guys from this show  Shane you got anything in your pocket?  Should it be the other way around?  Two fans and Sam?  You're right  Yeah Sam you're not going anymore  What?  We got to do the trip to Stryker  Stryker sucked  Laszlo makes a good point  The guy working really hard like that  And what?  He goes away empty handed  So do the right thing  And give up your trip to Stryker  I'll tell you what  Stryker  You can have E-Rock's ticket 
[03:31:30]  There you go  Wow you are generous  I'm just kidding  I'm just joking  He doesn't want to get into any legal problems  Yeah there's no  Well he said I had it  There's no ticket for Stryker  It's never good  It's never good to say just kidding  After you got no laughs by the way  Yeah  Well  Just kidding  Stryker  Stryker couldn't tell traffic from weather  That got me to where I wasn't going to give him any points  Yeah to me there was no second  Zero points  I mean you know 
[03:32:00]  Type A did such a great job  Yeah  I mean just head and shoulders  Luckily Stryker can watch on pay-per-view a week from Sunday  Yeah yeah we know we know we know  We know we know  We're going to make that point  We know we know we know  Actually I got to set my TiVo  Because I'll be there  And I like to do both  I like to buy it and go  Me too  Oh wow  That's cool yeah  I'll be buying it and going  And probably buying the replay too  Just in case I miss anything  That's not a bad idea  Yeah like a pyrotechnics disaster  Maybe we can put you in a Hell in a Cell match 
[03:32:30]  You accidentally like get locked in  It wouldn't be  Yeah  Oh that'd be great  That'd be awesome  Watch primetime Sam Roberts get killed  Just get pounded  Literally killed  Did you see his wrestling match?  No  Up there in that high school gym  Or where were you again?  I was at the New Hampshire High School  You never saw his match?  No  Oh it's just  Oh wow  That's amazing  Wow  I don't even know where to begin with this one  You actually got in it?  Well me and Pete Gass were guest judges for a boxer versus wrestler match  Right  And boy did we pull a swerve on those guys  Yeah 
[03:33:00]  Oh really?  Yeah they did not see it coming  But that boxer caught one mean low blow  From you or Pete Gass?  From me and then a sidewalk slam from Pete Gass  The YouTube is N-Y-S-W-F  You know they give the low blow move to the chicks in wrestling  Yeah yeah that whole underneath  Why are you doing the low blow move?  Well it's a good move  I mean it does the trick  Yeah why are you coming near me?  No I don't  Right  No?  Just to hear that  Look at primetime Sam Roberts up there  You know I don't deal well with aggression 
[03:33:30]  For those of you who don't know who I am  I'm primetime Sam Roberts from XM202  A producer of the Opie and Anthony show  A host of the Stan and Sam show  And a graduate of New Rochelle High School  And I am honored to have been asked to come this April 5th  To the New Rochelle High School  To the New York State Wrestling Federation  And call the boxer versus wrestler match  Larry Sweet and Sour Sweeney versus Larry Barnes  Fans I'm going to call this just the way you want to see it  Because I know entertainment  Your fro doesn't even make it into the picture 
[03:34:00]  Who's this?  Sweet and Sour  Sweet and Sour  Larry Sweeney pleased to meet you  How are you doing?  Good  So tell me something  You're going to be the judge  The judge is wrestler versus boxer match  Sure yeah yeah  Yeah alright great  Well listen man  I'm not for shame  This is like us watching college radio  What?  I mean really long time  Long time  I mean ever since you've been around  I've been a really  You know I've been following your career 
[03:34:30]  And it's an honor for me  To meet you  And you know there are a couple things  That I'd like to talk about  In private  Here I've got a card  Why don't I give you a card  And have your people call my people  Alright?  I'll do that  Alright that's great  Good to meet you  What's the laugh?  So is  That's how you cut a promo striker  Where's the match?  Yeah where's the match?  You didn't just ask for the match did you?  Gotta see the match  Shane what are you doing us? 
[03:35:00]  So I'm back and we can watch us offline  Oh  This is good  Hold on  So the match is going on  We gotta describe this for the radio audience here  Obviously a high school  Gymnasium  Yes  New Rochelle high school  And Sam decides he has to go into the ring  Oh Sam's head training ring  Here it is  What is he doing?  Boom  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Sam  So he does his move  He attempts to throw him into the ropes  Now watch where he just sticks his chest out 
[03:35:30]  And now Sam really doesn't know what to do  As he's in the ring now  Yeah Sam is just kind of loitering  Yeah he doesn't really know if he should get involved with the action  And he finally gets out of the ring  That was his big moment  Yeah  With his hoodie on  Cool  Yeah what do you think Shane?  Hmm  I think it's like a good strong manager role  You know you don't have a lot of managers anymore  And that's something that I think D.A.W. has been lacking 
[03:36:00]  Whoa  Okay  A little criticism  But I know how we could remedy that problem  Well  It's called saving money  What?  First we're gonna  First we're gonna see if you can take like a chair shot  I'll do it  Or a clothesline or  Yeah  Alright let's do it  You know  Actually if I didn't think you'd sue me  I would blash to it  That chair  You know  You have any idea what that feels like  Having a 240 pound man  Swing a chair as hard as he can at your head  No but  You know  Seriously 
[03:36:30]  It would fracture your skull  It could potentially break your neck  I'm open to new experiences  You know  Like paralysis  Get the lawyers on this man  Are they working today?  I would love to do that  I want to see Sam sign his life away  So Shane would give him a chair shot  Wouldn't it be fun?  I would love to do that right now  Oh would that be hysterical  Give me another cup of coffee  I would get all amped up  Hear that chair whistling  Swam  Crack him right on the head  Let's do it  Let's do it  Maybe that'll be the next one 
[03:37:00]  Maybe we can build to this  You get in training  Yep  Yeah  You know  You grow the fraud a little bit more  You get a little extra padding  Yep  You know  Like a wrestling angle  Alright  Yeah  How you feeling?  One more thing Shane  What happened to the Ultimate Warrior?  He seems a little cuckoo  We play his audio clips on our show  From time to time  From where?  Warrior series  From the Ultimate Warrior's personal website  Yeah  Oh really?  Warrior series  I don't know  I haven't talked to the Warrior  Many many many years  So I have no idea what he's doing 
[03:37:30]  I haven't heard much either  He wrestled a match in Spain  He's got like short hair  And he's much slower than he used to be  Well yeah  Well yeah  I would assume he's  Let's see  He's probably 46, 47 now  That happens as he gets older  Yeah  Yeah  You know  So how was the match?  Not that great  Better than the one we just watched?
