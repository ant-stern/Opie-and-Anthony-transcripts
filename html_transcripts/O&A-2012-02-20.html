<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's Mardi Gras 2005 broadcast from the Crazy Horse Cabaret (now the Penthouse Club) on Bourbon Street was a raucous, alcohol-fueled spectacle.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with producer Steve ("Martini Steve"), and their former New Orleans affiliate GM, Tom, were heavily intoxicated throughout the broadcast, which heavily featured the debauchery of Mardi Gras.  The show began with descriptions of the previous days' drunken escapades: Steve passing out in a strip club, Opie leaving a $200 bar tab, Anthony's girlfriend's encounter with a stripper in a bathroom, and Opie's significant chocolate stain (initially mistaken for feces) on his bed.  They recounted an awkward breakfast at Petunia's, a restaurant with male drag waitstaff, and complained about their inadequate XM radio accommodations – a small room with only a king-size bed and a cot.  The excessive vomiting and filth on the streets were also discussed, along with an anticipated "bead war" with a neighboring balcony, and Anthony’s girlfriend's encounter with a stripper needing a tampon.  Tom's aggressive bead-throwing to procure female exposure was highlighted, along with racially charged comments regarding its distribution.  The difficulties of navigating Bourbon Street's crowds and road closures were mentioned, with Club Soda Kenny's assistance in getting their limo through. The broadcast ended with Tom grabbing a stripper's genitals.


The broadcast continued with interactions with exotic dancer Jolie, who was a studio guest.  Tom's inappropriate physical contact with her was a recurring theme, along with his poor dental hygiene.  The hosts repeatedly threw cups and beads at people below, often resulting in comical mishaps. Jim Norton's increasing frustration with Tom's behavior was prominent, along with further accounts of Tom's intoxicated antics, including harassment of the hosts and guests. Club Soda Kenny attempted street interviews, hampered by technical difficulties and the general chaos.  Stories about Master Poe, a former security guard known for bizarre self-defense techniques and inappropriate behavior, and Stanley and his brother's dangerous pranks were also recounted.  A caller described a flight attendant's bizarre website plug for Jim Norton. The segment ended with a general consensus that broadcasting from New Orleans was a mistake.


The show continued with further accounts of their activities at the Crazy Horse Cabaret.  This included a detailed description of Master Poe's Bourbon Street performance, where he handed out WoW stickers and line-danced with women, becoming a target for Opie's bead-throwing.  Opie, Anthony, and associates spent considerable time throwing beads from the balcony, targeting drinks and people, describing various targets and reactions.  They detailed using different bead weights and sizes, including "Bunker Busters," and the ensuing bead war.  Tom's disruptive behavior was further explored, including alleged molestation of dancers, attempts to stiff the shot girl, excessive appetizer ordering, and dropping his phone in his soup.  A disastrous dinner with Tom and a superfan was recounted, highlighting Tom's poor behavior (eating Steve's appetizer) and Opie's intentional destruction of Tom's phone.  The hosts also mentioned getting lap dances and Anthony admitting to masturbating in a strip club.  An attempt to show a lap dance live on air was mentioned.  Lou Ferrigno was scheduled for a later phone interview.


The chaotic atmosphere continued with two adult film actresses, Chloe Love and Reagan Anthony, in studio giving lap dances to Jim Norton. They discussed their careers, specific films, specialties, and the G-String Awards. The bead-throwing escalated into a full-scale bead war, with people throwing beads and drinks back at the hosts and Brett, Opie's brother.  Interactions with various street people, along with comments about their appearance and behavior, were included.  Lady Di, a caller, was briefly on air but dismissed.  Attempts to connect with Lou Ferrigno were unsuccessful, and the segment concluded amidst the ongoing bead war.


The show continued with more bead-throwing from the balcony, targeting drinks and causing spills. The hosts made frequent vulgar and sexually explicit comments about the appearance and behavior of individuals in the crowd, particularly women. A woman became upset after having her drink knocked over, crying and throwing beads back; the hosts continued to target her. Bob Kelly, dressed in a suit, visited the studio, presenting VHS tapes of his early work. The hosts discussed playing clips, teasing the content and making jokes about the awkwardness and poor quality.  Specific jokes and bits, including his "boo-boo-boo" sound, were mentioned.  A discussion about a new Twisted Sister song ("30") ensued, with caller opinions.


The show concluded with a segment on sex addiction.  A caller, Wendy, a self-described sex-addicted trucker, detailed her sexual activities, including hundreds of partners and simultaneous encounters.  The hosts engaged in graphic questioning about her sexual practices and preferences, discussing her Myspace page.  Jimmy, a studio guest, discussed his own compulsive masturbation habits.  Bobby Kelly contributed, comparing quick gratification to avoiding deeper emotional engagement.  Another caller, Bob the Trucker, briefly expressed interest in Wendy. Wendy revealed her father molested her sister, and she was raised in a carnival environment. The conversation remained sexually explicit and graphic until Wendy was thanked for calling.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You want the worst? You got the worst? You want the worst?  Of Opie and Anthony. You want the worst? You got the worst? You want the worst of Opie and Anthony. The worst of Opie and Anthony. The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, not the countdown. It's actually a worst of. Opie and Anthony aren't here, so that means that I'm here. I think Sam is supposed to be here, but he showed, so I got to do this by myself.  If you've been listening recently, especially around Super Bowl time, the guys have complained that the company doesn't really pay much attention to us.  They don't send us places to do broadcasts anymore. We used to go to places all around the country. Vegas, Los Angeles, Boston, Philly, D.C., Cleveland, just to name a few. 
[00:01:00]  They don't send us anywhere anymore, and the guys want to know why.  So I dug back into the archives and found a show where they did send us somewhere, and guess what? They weren't happy that they were sent somewhere to do a broadcast.  This goes back to February 7th and February 8th of 2005, when the Opie and Anthony show had been back on Satellite for a few months.  They go to Mardi Gras down in New Orleans.  They're at what was called the Crazy Horse Cabaret at the time, but on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter in New Orleans. 
[00:01:30]  Now it's the Penthouse Club, I believe.  But O&A are down there live, and this first segment kicks it off.  We're down there. It's Opie, Anthony, Jim.  Our former producer Steve is down there. Steve the Bear. Steve.  Well, at this time, he's Martini Steve, because Steve used to have a drinking problem.  And we also met up with our former GM from our old New Orleans affiliate, Tom.  Tom from New Orleans.  Some of you old-school O&A listeners out there.  Tom's there with us. He's drunk, of course. 
[00:02:00]  And the guys are just talking about all the nonsense that goes on during Mardi Gras,  but all the women they've seen so far are just middle-aged messes.  Where are the hot chicks? Who knows?  It's Opie and Anthony, live in Mardi Gras 2005. Here we go.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We were pretty well hammered and gone by the time we even hit the airwaves.  I haven't had a drink yet.  No, it was the hurricanes that did us in last time.  And the listeners have been talking about our last New Orleans broadcast for years,  like how awful it was. 
[00:02:30]  So we figured maybe we'll at least try to do a broadcast today.  I got Tom behind me. He's knocking my head with beads.  He's really a pro, Tom, at getting the girls to perform for the beads.  He won't just throw them down. He's yelling at girls,  Come on, show me your titties. Just show me one. I'll throw you the beads here.  He's an animal with these beads.  But the problem is he has no discretion. He wants the fatties to show as well.  Oh, my God. The girl he got to show just before we went on the air,  she had to be about 350 pounds. 
[00:03:00]  With no boobs.  A slob with no boobs. She was what we call a flatso.  Flatso, yeah, yeah.  All belly, no boob.  And he got her to flash.  Not that we wanted to see it, but he's a professional.  He's here every year. He knows the drill.  It's like fishing. He has all sorts of beads.  He's got the really cheap ones for, like, the 10-year-old girls  where you can't, like, have them show anything, obviously.  Yeah, and then he throws the cheap ones down.  I've noticed there are a lot of girls throwing, like, panties down to a girl  that was about 12 years old.  Stop. What are you doing with her? 
[00:03:30]  And then Tom has the really nice beads,  and he has the Mac Daddy of beads around his neck that he's waiting for.  He almost got a girl to show, you know, the clam for the beads that he had around his neck.  Yeah, he gets girls to show their boobs, and then he goes for the snatch.  All right, who's the racist up here on the balcony?  That's all I want to ask.  Why, why?  I'm just noticing a pattern here.  Yeah.  When the black chicks come walking by, the beads are getting thrown down to them a little extra harder.  Oh, I swear to God. 
[00:04:00]  Do you think people are on purpose throwing?  Look, dude, I don't know.  I mean, half the balcony is our crew, and then there's another half that I don't know who those people are,  but I just saw some beads get rifled at some black chicks.  You know, I don't care about the color of their skin, but, you know, some of these girls,  the black chicks that have walked up, we saw one, looked just like Samuel L. Jackson.  And I don't want to be throwing beads and seeing the boobies of a girl that looks like Samuel L. Jackson.  Throw me the beads!  All right, speaking of Tom from New Orleans, let's get Tom on the air.  My bra is the one that says, man, motherfucker. 
[00:04:30]  How you guys doing?  Oh, Tom, there he is.  What's going on, Tom?  He can't hear.  Come on, baby, I need to see some Kenny.  He's tanked.  He's already tanked.  Look at him, he won't give the mic away.  I can't hear.  I can't hear.  Are we going to let Norton dead again?  No, stand back over there.  Come on, Norton.  You know you love me.  I do love you.  I smell him from here.  He's awful.  He is so hammered.  Dude, he just licked his tongue, and he just wiped your head, Norton.  Oh, God damn it.  No, that's going to drive Norton nuts.  We'll have Kenny come away.  That's going to drive Norton absolutely nuts. 
[00:05:00]  He is gone.  He is gone.  You know what the equivalent of having him lick your head is?  Have somebody take you and rub your head in that liquidy gutter down there between the  ground and the sidewalk.  That's exactly what it's like.  The walk from the hotel over here to the crazy horse balcony.  Hold on.  Can we slow down a second, though?  Because you just said something that was kind of funny.  The walk from the hotel to over here?  Yeah.  That was the first time you left the hotel.  I have not been out of the hotel since our plane landed, and we went to the hotel and  checked in.  We checked in what?  Three, four days ago?  I don't even know at this point. 
[00:05:30]  It seems like that, but it's New Orleans time.  A day is like three days back home.  I believe it was Saturday afternoon we got in, right?  I guess.  And now it's Monday afternoon.  I just left the room.  Yeah.  I want to start by the brainiacs that decided that we could just easily get to our hotel  on a Saturday night on Bourbon Street.  Oh, my God.  They had roads just blocked off, what, a mile in every direction, easily?  Yeah.  There's no vehicular traffic on these roads.  It's all pedestrians packed. 
[00:06:00]  I mean, from building to building, across the street, on the sidewalk, in the streets,  you cannot even walk, never mind get a car through there.  Yeah.  So we're in this limo, the whole crew, you know, and all of a sudden there's the road  block, and we're like, you've got to be kidding.  We're like 10 blocks away, and we've got luggage and everything.  Minimum.  Minimum of a half a mile.  Yeah.  And they're like, sorry, you're going to have to unload here and bring your bags to the hotel.  We're like, what?  Club Soda Kenny jumps out of the limo, shows his badge, says a few things.  Next thing I know, it's like the parting of the Red Sea. 
[00:06:30]  Kenny is walking next to the limo like a secret service for the president.  Yeah.  And everyone, he's just going, get out of the way, watch your bags.  And yeah, the crowd was parting.  Our car got to drive through, right up by the back door of the hotel, pretty much.  Yeah, it was perfect.  It was like that scene from In the Line of Fire.  Yeah.  I felt very proud to have Kenny with us.  So then what happened was we check into the hotel.  I go, all right, Ant, see you later.  Yeah.  And this is the first time I'm seeing you.  Like two days later, I finally see Ant. 
[00:07:00]  So anyway, you left the hotel for the first time and the walk over here.  I don't leave the room because I remember last time we were here.  Right.  And last time, it was a clusterfuck.  We all remember that.  Didn't we make a pact?  We were here, what, two, three years ago and we said we would never return?  We absolutely said we are never, ever coming back here again.  But kind of looking back on it, I think it had a lot to do with the broadcast.  It was so bad.  And it was, I mean, it's memorable now as being one of our worst broadcasts ever.  Ever, right.  But people now look at it fondly as that. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  So I think that put us off to it a little more, too.  The walk back to the hotel last time, we've yet to do that, by the way.  I think you guys have, though.  You've walked these streets at night.  We've been all over the place.  We were in some crazy Irish bar last night for the Super Bowl.  We'll get into all that.  That had a lot to do with it, too, because it is disgusting.  Right.  Your brother has a photo that he showed me.  That is the definitive Mardi Gras picture.  I don't mean the beads, the girls with the tits, the balconies, the people.  Not that.  It was one picture he showed me.  It was a close-up of a vomit splattered on the street with some beads in it. 
[00:08:00]  You know what the best part of that picture is?  It's like Technicolor.  You see how vibrant the colors were?  The greens were piercing.  And when we first got here on Saturday, my brother and I, the cool part is Bourbon Street  is just a complete sea of people.  It's like a river of people.  You could deal with it for about 10 minutes before you just want to punch someone, unless  you're up on one of these balconies, right?  But the cool thing about New Orleans and Mardi Gras is to go down these side streets. 
[00:08:30]  That's where it's manageable.  And that's where everyone pukes, because they're on Bourbon Street.  They've had too much to drink, too many hurricanes, and all of a sudden, they're like, all right,  I've got to go somewhere and puke, so they go down the side roads.  So the side roads are just littered with these amazing freaking piles of puke, and we've  been taking a ton of pictures.  We're going to make a collage of it.  Vomit hopscotch you play when you're going down the side streets.  Right.  So, yeah, you were talking about the walk over here.  Yeah.  The sidewalks, even though we got up early to go to breakfast this morning, and what happens 
[00:09:00]  is they get the crews out with their powerful hoses, and they hose everything down.  Yep.  You've got to see this freaking street at, like, I think we were up pretty early, 8.39 in  the morning.  I remember from last time we were here.  Disgusting.  It is putrid.  And then after they hose it down, you know, they're not getting on their knees and scrubbing  it.  Oh, my God.  We're about to see some amazing boobs.  Oh, there she is.  Tom's working this one.  This girl is beautiful.  Go ahead.  They don't scrub the street, so it just kind of collects in the gutters now. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  And the smell coming out of these gutters when we were walking over, I swear I almost  puked.  Yeah.  It hit me at one intersection.  It was vomit and, like, bad hot dogs.  And just bad, like, bar beer.  Yeah, bar beer.  That stale beer smell.  That morning after bar smell.  And the sidewalks are all slimy.  It's like taking a whole bunch of lard and just, like, you know, just, you know, rubbing  it into the sidewalk.  You can skate to the hotel.  And I think that's what kind of turned us off to it last time. 
[00:10:00]  It's got something like my last memory of it is that.  And then going back to the room.  And then we flew out the next day.  Right.  So I was kind of.  Oh, wow.  That was a nice one.  I was kind of leery about leaving the hotel since we've been here.  Yeah.  So me and my chick just hung out, you know.  You're kind of in a hotel.  And you're with your girls.  So it's kind of cool, you know.  Now, there are things you find to do in the hotel in between getting room service and  watching the Super Bowl.  Nothing wrong with that.  It wasn't, you know, it was nice.  But tonight, we're going out. 
[00:10:30]  And I think we might even stay here at the Crazy Horse because we've seen chicks coming  in and stuff.  The stage looks nice.  It looks like a nice, comfy place.  So I think we're going to hang out here and watch some chicks dance.  There's nothing wrong with that at all.  Jimmy, what's going on, buddy?  Just watching all the girls flash.  There's really nothing above a five here.  So far, it's been, well, this is like the daytime flashers, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like the daytime strip clubs and stuff like that.  But you know what I noticed, too?  Jimmy's right.  The girls and the guys that are with them, a lot of them in the daylight look like those 
[00:11:00]  couples you see on those HBO sex specials where they go to those sex clinics to learn how  to give a head and use a dildo and have an orgasm.  And they're the most heinous people you ever want to see.  They're about 50 years old, flabby.  That's the type of people you get at this hour.  I think later at night, it does kind of get better because those people are probably still  sleeping.  We were talking to some of the locals and they said that Mardi Gras this year is a little  weird.  It's a little earlier than usual, so you don't get as many college kids here, you know, where 
[00:11:30]  you get the nice young meat.  There's a lot of middle-aged women just flashing like crazy.  Look at this girl, completely topless with the body paint on.  Oh, she's painted, got beads on, she's got piercings.  Her boobs are painted in like a daisy flower.  Very nice.  We saw a couple of women that were about 60 years old.  They were wearing nothing but fishnet for shirts.  Right.  And it was heinous.  Like they left looking at themselves going, yeah, this is going to work today. 
[00:12:00]  People were giving them beads just so eventually it would cover their awful boobs.  I look good.  Really horrid.  So this is the most distracting thing because we're trying to do a talk show and out of the  corner of your eye, all of a sudden you'll see another girl flash.  Yeah.  You just keep talking, enjoy the breasts and then move on.  And then I have to think, what was Anthony just talking about?  Because, you know, some of you don't care about, others you're like, oh, hey, look at that.  It's funny, all the beer trucks are making their way in down Bourbon Street because it's  time to, you know, to reload and all these bar supply trucks, everything. 
[00:12:30]  And I've noticed that the Budweiser trucks and the Coors Light trucks and the rest of  them are so much more important than the lives of these human beings.  They get top priority.  You see how these things are backing up pretty much right over people.  They don't care.  It's like they got a job to do, man.  They got to get the, you know, all the bars reloaded.  Yeah, I saw one person waving off.  There's one of the trucks beeping.  I saw him waving off a linen truck, like I guess for napkins and tablecloths.  They were waving him away so they could back the Bud truck in place. 
[00:13:00]  So you know what the priorities are here.  Just ask Tom.  He knows too.  Drinking.  I think Tom's passed out somewhere.  Drinking, god damn.  We've been doing the Tom line, you know, the whole time we've been down here, wherever  we are, we're like, you can drink right here in Starbucks.  Yeah, it doesn't matter because his big line last time we came here was, they let you drink  right here in the airport.  Right.  And when we landed, I was amazed, you know, there's guys with big beer cups, they got that  hand grenade cup that looks like a hand grenade, drinking the hand grenade out of it, the hurricanes.  And you walk around the airport just drinking and everyone's hammered at the luggage carousel. 
[00:13:30]  You know, Tom gets on the bags because he thinks it's a ride and he starts going around  because he's drunk off his ass constantly.  So then every place we go, yeah.  They let you drink right here in the Starbucks.  Yeah, let me tell you, they let you drink right here in the emergency room.  I don't know about the dentist's office.  They might let you drink there, but I couldn't tell you.  Dude, we got such an Opie and Anthony crowd out here. 
[00:14:00]  It's not even funny.  We got Opie and Anthony t-shirts and signs.  It's getting nuts.  We're just getting started.  Why don't we take a break?  When we come back, we got to talk to Martini Steve and Club Soda Kenny.  Martini Steve's got the, it can only be described as the flaming pimp hat.  I heard about Martini Steve on evening number one.  All right.  We have so much to do.  We're just getting started.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from the crazy horse on Furman Street.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM. 
[00:14:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock filling in for the vacationing Opie and Anthony.  And, you know, recently we talked about how Sirius XM doesn't send us anywhere or anywhere  good, as they put it, to do broadcast, to do live remotes, to meet our fans in other  parts of the country.  Hell, even Canada.  We've never even gone there.  So I dug up some of the archives and found a show where they did get sent somewhere by  then XM radio at the time.  And guess what?  They weren't happy that they were sent somewhere to do a live broadcast.  We're going back to 2005, February 7th. 
[00:15:00]  Mardi Gras, New Orleans at the Crazy Horse Cabaret on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter  of New Orleans.  In this segment here, Tom from New Orleans is our former GM from our New Orleans terrestrial  affiliate.  He's down there.  What else is going on in this segment here?  Our former producer, Steve Martini Steve at the time, also becoming Steve the Bear, had  a story about passing out drunk at a strip club on the first night that they got to  New Orleans.  Ooh, Anthony thought he shit his hotel bed. 
[00:15:30]  He'll tell that story.  Opie leaves his brother and the staff with a $200 bar bill.  And Anthony's girlfriend had a run-in with a stripper in the bathroom.  Girlfriend at the time, I should say.  So let's go back to Opie and Anthony live at Mardi Gras 2005 here on The Worst of Opie  and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  We're broadcasting live from Bourbon Street in New Orleans at the Crazy Horse.  The Crazy Horse rocks.  This place is very, very cool.  We're going to have to check out the festivities after the broadcast. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  I don't know about going to a strip club with Tom, though, and getting a Hummer in some cheesy  office while you're being videotaped.  I really don't think I need that.  You'd probably say, and not a surprise, I'm the one giving them.  I love you guys.  I don't even know where that strip club is he's talking about.  He said it's off the beaten path.  Oh, it's probably around the place that I heard, because, of course, I was in my room,  Opie, much of this trip.  I just got out today.  It's kind of nice that you're out getting fresh air fired.  Yeah, kind of taking a look around, a lovely area. 
[00:16:30]  But I was watching some of the local news here in New Orleans, and six murders, six murders  in one day, by the way.  One day.  You don't even get that in all five boroughs of New York City nowadays.  But I was stunned.  There's Tom now, in the middle of Bourbon Street, holding up a drink.  It's a green drink.  Is that the grenade or the green hurricane?  Isn't that a hand grenade?  I don't think it was green until it actually hit his teeth and he backwashed it. 
[00:17:00]  Some messed up chemical reaction turned that green.  So he's throwing beads at him.  He's coming back up.  The guy, he's yelling, it's a grenade.  Tom's throwing a grenade.  Oh, it's a grenade, a hand grenade?  I wanted a goddamn hurricane.  Leave it.  You know something?  It serves me right for sending Tom out for a drink water for me.  I got you something.  Yeah, I know what you wanted, but I know what I want to give you.  And that's a hand grenade.  By the way, I want to give him a hand grenade, a real one in his mouth.  Exactly.  To improve his teeth. 
[00:17:30]  Who are these freaks on the other side of the balcony, by the way?  I don't know.  I think they're Tom's friends.  Those are Tom's friends.  Obviously, they're just babbling idiots.  They're trying to have a conversation with us, and we're doing a radio broadcast.  You're talking in a headphone.  It's like, dude, it's a hurricane.  All right, stupid.  I don't care.  It's a question.  Yeah, we're broadcasting to the entire nation, but we have to listen to you.  I'm trying to get more headphone volume because it's getting louder and louder up here.  Tom is losing his mind.  Oh, thank you.  That's much better.  Now I can hear myself.  Thank you.  All right, good.  Thank you, Tom. 
[00:18:00]  There we go.  Now we're all reaching back to the thing and turning our headphones back down a little bit.  Oh, let's just tell you that's cool.  Okay, that's much better.  By the way, Martini Steve is filming us up here on the balcony at the Crazy Horse, and  he's got his flaming pimp hat on, Anthony, that we bought this morning after breakfast.  This looks like it was made for Steve.  Like, this hat was put together just for Steve to wear.  The flame pattern on it is exactly like the flame pattern on his shirt and his shoes. 
[00:18:30]  You know, of course you can pick up flame wear anywhere, but to match the flames exactly  from his shirt and his shoes, it was meant to be.  And it's one of those wacky Mardi Gras hats.  Yeah.  It's all black fur, and then it's got, like, silver Christmas tinsel in it, and then the  top has flames, and underneath the brim has flames, and it is the gayest thing I've ever  seen.  Steve, you can't hear us, right?  I was.  Did you see the sign in the store?  It said if you buy two of these hats, you get a free load on the chin.  Atrocious. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  He was very excited when he found this hat.  Wow.  Why is Steve freaking out?  What are you doing?  I'm not freaking out.  Oh, he can't get the headphones around my hat.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't get you headphones or the hat.  Well, this is what sucks.  Once again, we're doing this broadcast, we're literally a foot away from each other, but  it's so loud.  Jaime did a great job with the microphones and everything, but it's so loud.  There's a bar across the way just cranking music, louder than I've ever heard music in  my life.  So we can't even hear each other.  We're a foot away.  So Steve has no idea what we're saying.  And there's a guy across the street who looks like Patrice O'Neal wearing a big purple hat 
[00:19:30]  that just says no cover.  Yeah, he's trying to usher people in.  It's very loud here.  It's Bourbon Street, Mardi Gras.  What do you expect?  You know, we got to deal with it.  Right.  And Steve can't hear us talking, so he needs headphones.  I kind of feel guilty because when we got in Saturday night, we all went out, did a little  dinner, and then we went to the House of Blues, and then we went to kind of just a dive  bar, you know?  And I was ready to leave, and I think it was Club Soda Canyon and a bunch of us were  heading back to the hotel.  Steve looked at me.  He had a few in him, right? 
[00:20:00]  Of course he did.  But he was trying to be responsible, and he looked at me, and he goes, I think I'm going  to go back with you guys.  And I, I'm an enabler, I think, because I go, Steve, nah, stay out.  Have some fun.  You're down in New Orleans.  Like, he was at that point where he was trying to show control, and he was ready to leave.  And all he needed was someone like me to go, yeah, all right, come on back with us.  Yeah, come on back, man.  But instead, I'm like, nah, Steve, you know, why don't you stay and have fun?  Put that little walnut stomach to use. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, thank you.  So that's the last I heard of Steve until we all started getting the phone calls in the  middle of the night, 2, 2.30.  I think Jaime has one on his phone.  Yeah.  That Steve passed out at a strip club, and they don't know how they're going to get him  back to the hotel.  Yeah, I was, I completely fell asleep in an easy chair in a strip club with girls all over  me kissing me, apparently, and I have no recollection.  Apparently, I was tired and disinterested and belligerent.  Yeah, that's a good word for it.  You forgot belligerent.  I wasn't belligerent.  I heard belligerent. 
[00:21:00]  I wasn't belligerent.  Is that what you call it?  Tired when you're passed out with a drink in your hand?  I wasn't belligerent.  It was a little tucked out.  Oh, sleepy.  I have no recollection of being belligerent.  He kept saying, I'm not going to rape you.  I'm not going to rape you.  I'm not going to rape you.  That is not true.  I heard that's true.  I mean, that's just a rumor.  That is not true.  That's a rumor from another city.  We're talking about New Orleans now.  Yeah, that didn't happen in New Orleans.  But I just felt bad because he really wanted to be responsible and come back to the hotel,  and I was the one, I think, that pushed him over the edge.  Like, nah, stay out. 
[00:21:30]  Stay out where all the drunks are and all the alcohol is, Steve.  You'll be fine.  Good one, O.  Well, I think what Ben was doing was sending the girls over to try to make out with Steve and  stuff, even though he was a little sleepy.  Yeah, I was a little tired.  But I was trying so hard to maintain some little modicum of control, and you, you know.  Someone was telling me, too, that they finally got you up out of the chair.  You woke up for a little while.  And we all have these wristbands on.  It's the only way you can get in and out of the hotel.  And Steve forgot where he was. 
[00:22:00]  I swear this is true.  Someone said it.  All Steve said was, bring me here, and points to his wristband.  Oh, my God.  Like, he had no idea where the hotel was, and he didn't even know the name of the hotel.  But he remembered somewhere in his drunken stupor that the name of the hotel was on his  body.  So all he said was, bring me here.  And it was pointing at his wristband.  You like tats.  You have tattoos.  You want to get your address tattooed on your wrist.  I really should.  So you could just go bring me here whenever that happens.  Because I've gotten ripped drunk at Mardi Gras. 
[00:22:30]  I can check that one off the checklist.  Now I don't have to do it again.  I heard that you passed out.  You were asleep in that chair.  Yeah.  And someone tried to give you a hot foot, but no one even noticed.  It was put a little match in there, lit it, and nothing happened.  He wasn't passed out.  He was hibernating.  Yeah.  Jesus.  In his lair.  A little cozy lair.  It was very comfortable.  So then Steve was very responsible last night as we were watching the Super Bowl.  I was amazed that he wasn't drinking last night.  But here's a straw for your drink, Anthony.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:23:00]  And it's wrapped like Howard Hughes likes it.  Thank you.  I saw that.  It was wrapped in a napkin so other people touching it wouldn't upset me.  By the way, can we bring Club Soda Kenny in here?  Wow, the music's getting even louder across the way.  People are screaming.  We need a mic for Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny's just looking at it like a deer trapped in headlights.  He has no idea what's going on.  Because no one can hear us.  Girls are flashing below us.  We got Opie and Anthony freaking beer mugs that we're throwing down to the people.  We're throwing down and hurting some people. 
[00:23:30]  I like the people that actually, we got these, yeah, they're beer cups.  We throw them down to the people.  And sometimes they roll into the gutter, into the sleaze water in the gutter,  and people pick them up.  Yeah.  And wipe them off.  Well.  Talk about a little hepatitis cocktail next time you drink something out of that.  I guess it's a very valuable item.  And there you go, fatty.  Wow.  And we're throwing down these great, XM has like 5,000 of these Opie and Anthony cups.  It's the Opie and Anthony.  They have the little caricatures with the down syndrome heads. 
[00:24:00]  And then on the back it says XM satellite radio.  So the ground is like littered with them.  Because once somebody misses it, they won't pick it up.  Some people do.  Some people don't.  So, yeah, they're kind of littering the roadway.  Don't you guys hear me popping on the mic every time I say P?  Well, you've got to be a professional and know how to say your P's without actually popping them.  All right.  I was doing the same thing.  I'm not a professional broadcaster either.  Don't worry about it.  I hope I get some lussie down here.  How's that?  Excuse me.  Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny has made his way to this side of the balcony.  Hey, Kenny.  I just want to ask for a raise because I have to deal with Tom from New Orleans. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I want a raise for this trip.  I heard about that.  Back off the mic.  You don't have to swallow the mic there.  Yeah.  Is he really causing you anguish?  He's getting to that point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is very annoying.  Yeah.  Can you just make sure he doesn't lick Norton's head?  I'm going to make sure he doesn't do anything out of line.  All right.  Thank you.  Keep him in line.  I just wanted to ask you one thing.  Yeah.  Did you send a girl to my room last night? 
[00:25:00]  No.  Because there was a girl came to my room last night.  She offered me super sex.  Yeah.  So I took the soup.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  I do have to.  Did you enjoy breakfast this morning?  Don't give the gag away, but did you enjoy it?  What, with the homo joint?  You took me, too.  I didn't take you there.  Not a...  Homo joint.  Now, listen to this.  The hotel recommended this.  Kenny goes...  You know, Kenny does everything for us.  It's on the road, right?  So he goes to the concierge.  Concierge. 
[00:25:30]  Concierge.  Consigliere.  And asks for a nice place to have breakfast, right?  Tom, I need a nice place for breakfast.  Tom, you're the concierge.  You talk to him.  Mike is the manager of this hotel.  So this guy suggests this place called Petunia's.  Yeah.  Petunia's.  Sorry, Tom.  I can't take it at Petunia's.  You're out.  We should have known that it was going to be a strange place because it was called Petunia's.  So we all go.  We walk into the joint. 
[00:26:00]  It was me and Kenny, my brother.  Steve.  And Steve the Bear.  Who fit right in.  He definitely fit right in.  The first thing we see as we walk in, it's all men as the waiters.  Ooh.  Dressed in drag with fluorescent wigs and fluorescent eyelashes.  That doesn't tell you something right there.  They all had big boobies.  They had Catholic schoolgirl skirts on with the thigh highs and the F me type boots. 
[00:26:30]  And why were you there long enough to even notice all this?  Why weren't you turned around and out?  Because we were hungry.  Yeah.  And I must say, the breakfast was very nice.  Very nice.  Why, as soon as we walked in, I'm like, here's 15 to 20 minutes of effing radio.  And here's 15 to 20 sigpicks.  True.  They look like female, like Oompa Loompas.  Yeah.  Because of the fluorescent waves and stuff.  The food was excellent.  But we're looking at these guys like, what is going on here? 
[00:27:00]  I was trying to pick out the hot one.  Yeah, we're all going, so who do you think is the hot one here?  What did you have, Eggs Ben's dick?  So then we couldn't figure it out.  And obviously we had these looks on our faces like, what are you guys doing, right?  And then they finally explained that, I guess, once a year they have to dress up like chicks.  Because tomorrow's what, Fat Tuesday, right?  Yep.  So I guess they're closed tomorrow, so it's a big deal.  And this is what they do every year. 
[00:27:30]  They're known for this.  They have their waitstaff, you know, dressed in drag.  So normally they're not in drag?  No, no, not at all.  It was a gay joint, though?  No, it wasn't a gay joint.  No, no, it turned out to be very nice, actually.  Very hetero?  Yeah, the food was good.  Our waiter was like 350 pounds, dressed up like this.  And he's trying to have a normal conversation with us.  And I'm like, could you just get me a refill of coffee, please?  Yeah.  It was just really, really awkward.  Yeah, he wanted to make small talk.  Yeah.  So, sounds great.  I'm sorry I missed it. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I said, cut the chit-chat, sailor.  Hey, Steve, did you like the breakfast joint this morning?  See, no one can hear us.  Every time we want to talk to someone, we've got to hand the headphones over.  The only thing, I heard the only thing Steve really didn't like about it was they bring  the breakfast sausage in their asses.  Yeah, thank you.  Did you like the breakfast joint today?  I did.  Well, I like the food.  The guys were a little creepy.  A little creepy?  Oh, very creepy.  Yeah, they were very, very strange.  Yeah, with their flame hats.  Yes, thank you.  Well, actually, one of them looked almost feminine except for the Adam's apple. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, you found one guy a little attractive.  No, no, I didn't find him attractive.  Steve's like, that one's a girl.  I'm like, she's not a girl.  Look at the Adam's apple, you idiot.  You just said, she's not a girl.  Oh, jeez.  See how easy it is to fall into that trap?  Yeah, well.  Before you know it, you've got your hand on the back of her big shoulders.  It was good, though.  So, then I go back to my room, and I saw a disaster in my bed.  It was a disaster.  And I panicked, because last night after the Super Bowl, we were out pretty late. 
[00:29:00]  We ended up on one of these balconies, the Southern Comfort Balcony.  Yeah.  Look at this guy with the O.P. and Anthony T-shirt.  What's up, bro?  He's ringing an inappropriate bell as he's walking down the street.  And he has no idea what we're saying, because they're not pumping the show out to the street.  So, I go back to my room to crash for a little while, right?  Yeah.  And I notice, like, what can only be described as shit stains. 
[00:29:30]  Ooh.  Where?  I got it on my bed.  In your bed?  All over one of my pillows, and all over, like, you know, the fitted sheet.  Ugh.  Dude, not just a little, like a lot.  And the only thing I could think of, think about, was, like, last night when I got home really late  from the Southern Comfort Balcony and all that, you know, they had those little mints.  Right.  The mint on your pillow.  So, you know, I'm getting ready to crash.  I'm watching some more of the Super Bowl coverage on ESPN.  The chocolate. 
[00:30:00]  Really, it's the five-hour post-game show that they did on ESPN or whatever.  Right.  And I'm like, oh, I'm craving chocolate, so I eat this chocolate thing, and I'm thinking  I ate the whole thing.  I must have not ate the whole thing, and somehow it got in my bed.  Oh, well, maybe when you took a bite, a little piece cracked off, ended up in the bed.  But that's what I don't understand.  A little piece is going to make that much of a mess?  A little chocolate can go a long way.  A little goes a long way.  I noticed once, I had a similar story.  I was eating one of these meal bars, and it was a chocolate chip one, and I'm eating it 
[00:30:30]  in bed.  And I'm kind of sitting up in bed, and one chocolate chip, now it's pretty tiny, falls  down, and it must have fallen and gone kind of between my legs, where, you know, my ass  would be in my bed.  I didn't notice it.  So I go to sleep, and as I hunkered down to sleep, I must have smeared it on the sheet.  And I wake up in the morning, I get out of bed and look, and right where my ass was is  this skid mark of chocolate on my white sheet. 
[00:31:00]  Now, I knew what it was.  I knew I didn't crap the bed.  But I wanted to make sure my girlfriend knew what it was, because how embarrassing would  it be to leave?  She goes to get out of bed, flips the sheets over, and sees a shit stain down the sheets  on the side her loved one sleeps.  So I had to, you know, I'm trying to be quiet because it's very early in the morning, but  I had to wake her up.  I had to wake her up and go, baby, that's not shit.  Just got to wake up and hear my excuse for why there's a brown skid mark in my bed. 
[00:31:30]  You should have scraped your finger through it and tasted it and said, look, it's chocolate.  And then you realize you were wrong.  It was shit.  I feel like a silly goose.  Yeah, after I lick it, I pull the sheets down further and see the chocolate chip laying  there, mocking me.  I was convinced that this was left behind from whoever was using the room before me.  They wash the sheets every time.  Yeah, I know.  But I'm like, how did all this get all over the place, right?  So then I, of course, have to scratch with my, you know, finger.  And I got to do the smell test, because I'm in a major panic. 
[00:32:00]  Why didn't you wrap it in toilet paper and scratch?  Because, you know, crap, it doesn't come off that finger.  I thought it would be there for months.  I think I was confident of thinking that most likely it's going to be the chocolate, but  I wasn't sure.  So I was like, all right, I got to scratch to make sure.  And it was.  It was chocolate.  Wow, look at that.  So, hey, that was very nice.  Bravo.  Redhead with the black roots just showed her big, big old can.  I didn't see him.  You missed, Jimmy.  She did very well, because she's getting just slammed with beads.  Literally.  Who cut through that?  Who cut through that? 
[00:32:30]  Is that you, Ben?  No, it's my brother, Brett.  Your brother, Brett, is a pisser.  Wait, just to finish the story.  So I leave the room, and the cleaning lady was right outside my door, and I took the covers  all the way off.  So now you see, I'm not kidding yet, like a foot, you know, a foot long, at least, like  a foot chocolate stain, and then it was on the pillow.  And I didn't want to, you know, let her off the hook, so I go, oh, there was an accident  there.  I just want to warn you.  Oh, you told her it was an accident? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I didn't tell her what it was.  I had an accident there.  I thought she said it to you for a second, which really would have been scary.  So that was kind of exciting this morning when I got back from the Petunias breakfast  joint.  Petunias.  Well, now, I go downstairs this morning, and I go out to the, Kenny leads me to the atrium  outside the hotel.  Very lovely area outside.  It's like the courtyard.  Beautiful weather down here.  It's overcast, and it's supposed to rain, but the temperature, you know, when you think  of New York, the way it's been the past couple of weeks, to be in 70 degree temperature is 
[00:33:30]  fantastic.  I love it.  So we're sitting outside, and so we're hanging out, and they're talking about their night  last night.  And one thing they bring up, they're kind of going back and forth about how Ben and  your brother got stuck with the $200 bar bill last night.  And I guess your brother Brett had a kick in $100, and Ben kicked in $100.  And all of you guys were drinking, and all I had to say was, Opie, what the heck?  You make your brother pay for his goddamn drinks? 
[00:34:00]  Hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not true, though.  You pull out the Amex.  You pay the tab.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  That's not true.  First of all, I wasn't drinking.  But that doesn't matter.  I'm not talking about how much you drank.  Second of all, I wasn't drinking.  You were most of the bar tab.  It doesn't matter, is what I'm saying.  If your men are drinking, it is your responsibility to pull out that Amex and write it off.  It's a business trip.  Dude.  You had to let your brother pay $100 for a night of drinking.  $100.  $100.  It's completely out of line. 
[00:34:30]  You have nerves.  You don't even hang with us.  You're hanging in a hotel the whole time.  The first night we were here, I picked up dinner for everybody.  Got no thank yous from anyone, but whatever.  They're too busy calling the papers.  And then I looked at my brother last night, and I asked him if he needed cash, because  I didn't know what was going on, because I wasn't drinking last night.  Dude, I looked at you and asked you if you needed cash.  Oh, my brother's going to throw me under a bus.  I know it.  It's amazing, because I looked at him, and I go, dude, do you need cash? 
[00:35:00]  I gave him the cash sign, because I didn't know what was going on.  I did actually.  I got to be fair.  Yeah.  And believe me, I'm happy to see you getting booed under the bus.  But he did actually say, do you need cash?  It wasn't very loud, but he did actually go, do you need some cash?  And I kind of leaned on him like, what?  He goes, no, no, no.  I didn't hear it.  Nothing, nothing.  He actually did ask.  Thank you.  You did ask.  Because I had a couple beers with my buddy Bull, and I was hanging in the back with Norton.  We had our own little thing going.  We had no idea what was going on with these guys.  I was just under the impression, if your brother is there, if your brother is there, there's  no way he should have to pull out $100 to pay for a bar tab. 
[00:35:30]  That's all I'm saying, Opie.  I heard them complaining about it this morning.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  All right.  Here's what I'm going to say.  Wait, wait, wait.  Dinner on Anthony tonight.  Dinner on Anthony.  I will absolutely take everyone out tonight.  If you're even going to hang with us tonight.  I'm hanging tonight.  Howard Hughes.  You know what, though?  We got Howard Hughes going to his room because he's worried about something.  I do have to test fly a plane, but I'll be there.  He's worried about the puke and the scum on the sidewalk, so I don't even know if he's  going to leave his hotel tonight.  But if we're lucky to have Anthony hanging with us tonight, Anthony will pick up the bill. 
[00:36:00]  These are the Hughes brothers.  Anthony Hughes doesn't want to get germs on his hands from going outside, and Greg Hughes  doesn't want to get germs on his hands from pulling money out.  I am doing it right now.  I am inviting everyone to dinner tonight.  Pick out a restaurant.  I will absolutely go and put the bill.  Boy, are you going to actually hang with us tonight, Anthony?  I said I was going to hang tonight and tomorrow.  He's trashing me, but we haven't even seen him for two days.  I've been hibernating like Steve. 
[00:36:30]  And I flew my brother down here.  Okay.  That's true.  And see, I'm going to get thrown under the bus for this one, too, and I did feel guilty.  See, last minute, I told my brother, you want to come to New Orleans.  He's always wanted to go to Mardi Gras, right?  So we fly first class, which I've talked about on the air before.  Oh, not we.  It's a little awkward for me personally from where I come from, but, you know, it's a nice  little perk that we have now, right?  Sure.  So by the time it was time to book my brother's flight because it was a last-minute thing. 
[00:37:00]  Voss.  There was no, where?  Jokes for donation sign, the guy who's walking down the street.  That should be Voss' sign.  It should be Voss.  By the way, what's awkward about flying first class?  It's just, we've talked about it on the air.  It's just, it's a weird thing with me.  I don't feel like I, it's just weird.  I don't feel like I deserve it and all that from where I come from.  The only thing awkward about first class is that Ben and Steve actually try to make eye  contact when they're walking back through the coach.  Yeah.  It's like, look straight down into your magazine.  Keep going.  I'm not used to the, you know, the first class treatment.  That's all.  I mean, I'm going to try to get used to it because it's very cool. 
[00:37:30]  But, so by the time I booked my brother's flight to come down here, there was literally  one seat left on the plane.  It was the worst seat.  Oh my God.  That's right.  He sat in the worst seat on the plane.  Dude.  The worst seat.  Fred, explain where you were sitting.  I think I was sitting in the bathroom, to be very honest with you.  It was in the bathroom.  He was sitting on the toilet.  I'm the only seat that could not recline, but everyone in front of me was more than  happy to recline right in my face.  It's that seat that's right at the back of the plane where the wall is, so you can't 
[00:38:00]  recline.  Yeah.  He was the seat right next to the bathroom.  Both bathrooms.  Both bathrooms.  New bathrooms.  On the back wall where his seat couldn't recline.  The Gremlin had a better seat in the nightmare at 30,000 feet episode of the Twilight Zone.  Wow.  And then explain to Anthony who you were sitting next to.  I was sitting next to one of God's special friends that decided that God's.  Special friends.  Oh, yeah.  He likes to drool, and he likes to share a drool with everyone else that likes to sit  next to him.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  You had a tar next to you?  You did have the worst seat on the plane.  And his mother sat about a row away from us, and she decided to scream across me to yell  at him as he's drooling on me.  Wait, you had to sit next to amphetamines in the gene pool when she was pregnant?  One of those disasters?  Didn't she have to tie a shoe or something?  She had to tie a shoe.  She had to tie it over me.  Her breasts were pressed against my face, which wasn't too bad.  And although she was 77 years old.  That's even better.  And they bought him drinks on the plane, too.  He had Bloody Marys out the air.  Keep them calm. 
[00:39:00]  You've got to keep them calm, right?  So little God's special creature was drunk, too, screaming at people.  And every two seconds, you hear the phantom, and then, poof, the smell, and I look down  the little aisle, and there's a little Opie and Anthony and all those guys with the nice  little food.  I didn't even look back once.  And the pillows.  I had a little guilt going on.  I'm like, my brother's back there somewhere rowing.  I call them the rowers now.  Yeah.  They're called the rowers, and I couldn't look back to see where you're sitting in the 
[00:39:30]  bilge.  Good.  Honestly.  You want to talk about travel problems?  I understand your seat wasn't good.  But, dude, on the way in, there were no oyster egg crackers for my hot cream of asparagus  soup.  Oh, my God.  That soup was really good.  No oyster egg crackers.  I understand the last seat on the plane is uncomfortable, but try eating hot soup without  oyster egg crackers.  I don't know why they get so, like, mad at some of those seats, too, because I made sure  I looked back, and I had my wine glass full of wine for my meal, and I kind of, like, 
[00:40:00]  lifted it up to them in the back and said, hey, guys, how you doing?  So, I even acknowledged them, and they still were like, oh, we've got bad seats.  I don't like the fact that there's a curtain between first class and coach.  It used to be a dark curtain, but since 9-11, for security reasons, they now have, like,  a kind of a transparent, opaque blue curtain.  I don't like it, though, because I almost don't want them to look up and see what it's  like up there.  The pleasure in there.  You know, that's nice of you that you wouldn't want them to see that.  Don't rub it in.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcast live from Bourbon Street at, what is this place called? 
[00:40:30]  Crazy Horse, right?  Crazy Horse.  Very cool place.  Hot chicks.  Oh, my God.  The chicks are showing up for work.  They're just phenomenal.  Just walking around in their little, little outfits, getting ready for the night's festivities.  Yeah, my chick had a fun little story when she went into the bathroom.  Okay, real fast.  She walks into the bathroom, and the dancers are all getting ready to go on.  So, my girlfriend's by the sink, putting her makeup on, and this dancer comes running  in, her underwear to her knees, with a tampon in her hand, like, as she's running, trying 
[00:41:00]  to apply it, put it in, and then she sees my girlfriend and just goes, oh!  Oh, she was having, like, she kind of felt it coming on real quick?  Yeah, I guess she had to run, like, oh!  And her panties were by her knees as she's running with a tampon.  It's like someone just blew a cannonball through the dam, and you know it's about  to burst, and I'm going to plug it real quick.  Plug it up.  I'd hate to be a chick.  Oh, but I have to look at that.  And then, you know, we'll go down later and watch the girls dance, and I'm sure she'll 
[00:41:30]  point out which girl it was, and we'll all laugh.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  We're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  I am filling in for the vacationing Opie and Anthony, and we're looking back at a show  that XM Satellite Radio, at the time, in 2005, sent Opie and Anthony to Mardi Gras in New  Orleans.  Let's see what's going on in this segment here.  The guys are on the balcony, and they're hucking handfuls of beads at people to try to knock 
[00:42:00]  over the drinks, hit them in the head, hit them in the face, and then we find the stripper  who had her period, and we comment on her as well.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from Bourbon Street in New Orleans.  We're at Crazy Horse, the Crazy Horse.  Oh my God, that's a mess right there.  That's a big black guy dressed like a gladiator.  I gotta tell you, we're on this balcony at the Crazy Horse's balcony over there.  We're just, I think we're about a half hour away from having a major bead war with that 
[00:42:30]  balcony.  Full-blown bead war.  We're starting to flirt with each other a little bit, like the girls over there showing  their boots, we're throwing some beads nice right now, and they're throwing beads  nice back, I guarantee you, half hour from now it's going to be an all-out war with that  balcony.  You watch, okay?  I've been firing like fistfuls of beads down at people on the street trying to knock drinks  out of their hands.  This is what I noticed last night from the Southern Comfort balcony.  Yeah.  We were up there relatively early after the Super Bowl where it wasn't too crazy yet,  and people just take their time with their beads, they point out a girl down below and 
[00:43:00]  it's all nice, and they kind of gently toss it after she shows her boobs and everyone's  happy and they're applauding, right?  Right.  You fast forward about an hour, hour and a half, and it's just an all-out pegging that's  going on.  I'm going to nail this woman.  People.  Oh!  Nice!  Did you hit her?  Yeah, right in the arm.  Pulled the fat peg hanging out the corner with her?  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  I nailed her like Kennedy.  You almost took out the side window.  But what I was saying, and then as the night goes on, you know, it's just an all-out pegging 
[00:43:30]  that goes on.  Yep.  People are just trying to, you know.  Hurt people.  Pretty much hurt each other, you know?  One of them, we just took out this car.  I just nailed that woman.  They're in an SUV and their windows are open and we just completely destroy them.  And she's all happy, like, waving at us.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's unacceptable.  Kennedy has to completely take over from now on.  Yeah.  And I won't accept anything different.  She is the guy that knows what we need.  And what XM has to do, whatever differences or problems they have with Club Sona Kennedy, 
[00:44:00]  it's time to get the fuck over it.  Because I'll tell you what happened.  I checked into my room, right?  Everyone knew I was bringing my brother down here.  Yeah.  There's one king-size bed.  One king-size bed.  And the room is so small, which is fine.  I don't really care.  I'm not a diva.  Trust me.  But we had to bring up a cot for my brother to sleep.  A cot?  And there's nowhere to place the cot.  Nowhere.  And everyone knew ahead of time, but this is because details aren't being taken care of 
[00:44:30]  like they should be.  Kenny will take care of every detail.  Kenny was on the road with Dice for 13 years.  He knows this.  And it's really starting to get really frustrating that XM just doesn't get it.  I got you.  You know?  I hear you.  And then we called down.  There's no other rooms available.  It's effing Mardi Gras.  No.  So we got the king-size bed and a cot.  I can't even move around my room at all.  I can't.  Oh, brother.  And then, you know, then to get the phone call from Norton's two-level suite that could  sleep like, I don't know, ten people comfortably, it hurt a little. 
[00:45:00]  I felt so guilty that I just kind of walked around downstairs in the living room area in  my suite going, I'm just sitting on the couch for 30 seconds.  All right.  I'm done with this area.  Let me walk up this staircase.  Go upstairs.  It's nice and dark in there.  I love it.  But I'm telling you, one bar of soap in a suite of that size is just not acceptable.  The nerve.  That has to be fixed.  So anyway.  We're in the nicest hotel in New Orleans, though.  There really is no better hotel than what we're in.  It is really nice.  It's gorgeous, but, you know. 
[00:45:30]  But, yeah, it would have been nice to have maybe twin beds in there.  And they're sick of us complaining about this stuff, but we keep telling them we know  the solution.  Just let us.  And he's the guy.  Oh, wait.  What do we got here?  Wow, look at this girl.  Wow.  I can't see.  Hold on, Tom.  I can't see.  Tom is like, oh, Jesus.  Tom just grabbed the girl's snatch.  Can I grope the...  Yeah, go ahead.  You can say whatever you want.  It's satellite radio.  He just tried to stick two fingers in there.  You saw that, right?  He cannot grope the strippers.  That's illegal.  No.  I don't blame him for wanting to grope you, but that, I mean, that's just trying to make 
[00:46:00]  two fingers disappear.  Oh!  And then he just dances away all innocent, like, what did I do?  What's your name?  My name's Jolie.  Jolie?  I'm the exotic schoolgirl.  That's the crazy one.  Yes, you are.  Look, she's got a little schoolgirl-type shirt on.  It's recess.  It's time to play.  Yeah, when do you guys start dancing?  We're trying to figure that out.  We're dancing.  I just got off stage.  Oh, really?  I'm all hot and sweaty.  Wow.  You're lovely.  You've got to love that accent down here.  No, she's a lovely girl.  Very nice.  Tom, what were you trying to do? 
[00:46:30]  Uh-huh.  What were you trying to do?  My girlfriend.  Uh-huh.  You were like...  Girlfriend.  She's horrified.  You don't make me vacuum.  Huh?  You don't make me vacuum.  Yeah, we got the other mic on, Jaime.  She doesn't make me vacuum.  She's horrified of Tom.  Horrified.  We just hooked up, right?  Yeah, just hooked up.  She doesn't make me vacuum.  Ah, is that it?  She's ripping hot.  You're trying to make two fingers disappear, though.  It's illegal to touch the strippers in that fashion. 
[00:47:00]  Ow!  Look, that is a pretty pussy, guys.  Ah!  Oh, jeez.  Ow!  Tom, don't do that.  Don't do a pancreas exam on her.  Jesus.  I got to tell XM, these cups are genius.  These really are fantastic, man.  Nobody's catching them.  Every time y'all throw the cups, nobody can catch them.  Well, if somebody misses a cup and it rolls into the gunky water, they just kind of leave it.  Excuse me, ma'am.  It's time for the old pap smear.  Let me use my dirty, alcohol-laced fingers.  I'll tell you if you have cancer. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, there you go, Tom.  Hey, we got someone on the line that was on the plane with Jim Norton to New Orleans.  Is that true?  Really?  Let's see if Todd is still there.  Todd, what's going on, buddy?  Hello.  Hey, Todd.  Are you on the plane with Jim Norton?  Yeah, I was on the same plane as Jim.  And I was sitting back in close-toes.  Of course, he was sitting up in first class.  And I kept on looking down the aisle.  And the flight attendant looked just like Noah.  And he came up to me, spoke with a lisp. 
[00:48:00]  And he said, can I help you, sir?  And I said, well, I think I might know the guy sitting up there in first class.  And he had the nerve to tell me.  He said, hey, if you want to see Jim Norton, log on to Jim's website at www.edapullet.com.  Who saw that coming?  Oh, my God.  That was the best plug ever.  The flight attendant said all that.  That guy is great.  He had me.  I was in the plane with him.  Like, I felt like I was there.  And then all of a sudden, I'm blindsided by a cheap plug.  Oh, Stress Factory this weekend in Eatontown, the new Stress Factory. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you, sir, for that plug.  That was fantastic.  What a great plug that guy gave.  Sneaky bastard.  Do you have to get back on stage?  Eventually.  Eventually?  Look how low her little skirt is.  That is so cool.  You can almost see.  Can I see your hiney?  It's so close to ground zero there.  Wow.  Very nice.  Saturday night, somebody shot me in the ass with a BB gun.  So I was having people check and see if I had a bruise.  Are you kidding?  Why would someone shoot you in the ass with a BB gun?  They didn't mean to.  They shot the ground and it ricocheted. 
[00:49:00]  And I was just like, well, holy fuck.  I was drunk.  I didn't feel it.  It's terrific.  Oh, what's up?  It's amazing.  What's up?  You left that torture boy.  Of course we like it, Tom.  Boys, one thing you said about me, which is most true until today.  You were drunk.  I never disappoint.  Do I disappoint?  Come on, boys.  No.  Do I disappoint?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I never disappoint.  Jimmy.  Yes, Tom?  Wait a little later tonight for it.  I'm waiting for it.  Wow.  That's great. 
[00:49:30]  I got you covered, brother.  Thank you, Tom.  My famous head licker.  Why don't we take the Oreo tester?  Did you notice his teeth?  How awful they are?  You can say it.  She's making these horrendous faces.  We talk about his teeth right to his face.  I'm missing my teeth.  When you look at his teeth, do you think of Eli Wallach running while the ecstasy of the  gold plays?  I'm going to put it out of his teeth.  Hey, I want to see my tongue strike watch.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, she can fold her tongue. 
[00:50:00]  It looks like a three-leaf clover.  Wow.  We like that.  That's great.  That's great.  She's just so talented, Anthony.  I'd like to.  I love her.  I don't know if this is too risque or something.  I'll try to clean it up for the air, but that would probably feel great on a cock.  Oh, maybe I should have put it in a different way.  I've been folded.  You have.  Really?  That's a surprise.  That statement's as surprising as Tom doesn't go to the dentist. 
[00:50:30]  If he did go to the dentist, he'd attack his teeth in a hose like Civil Rights footage  in 1965 from the other room.  They use the same hoses they're using to clean the sidewalk on Tom's teeth.  All right.  Well, thanks for stopping by.  She's got to get back on stage.  She's beautiful.  We'll check you out later.  Yes, she is hot, man.  I didn't want to ask.  You think she's the one that had the.  Yeah, I was informed she is the one.  That's the one that is having her time of the month on her period.  Oh, wow.  Good.  Oh, wow.  She's I think.  Wow.  I thought she was really tall, but her spite. 
[00:51:00]  Her.  Wow.  Her stripper shoes are about a foot high.  That's why when Tom pulled his hands away, it looked like he had reached his hand into  a cherry Jubilee.  Well, I didn't know what it was.  I'm like, hey, Tom, pass me the pistachios.  Tom is just the worst.  He just doesn't care.  Tom doesn't care.  He walked right up to that girl and just grabbed her crotch.  Yeah.  He's a animal.  Yeah.  He's got some redeeming value, doesn't he?  They let your fingers train.  It's right here in the air, Paul.  I think we've got to say hi to Tommy Harris from Engine 23, 58 Street and 7th Avenue there 
[00:51:30]  in New Orleans enjoying Mardi Gras.  They wanted a shout out, Anthony.  That's nice.  And some kid brought by a framed Cobain picture for me?  Yeah.  That's a nice photo.  Ooh.  Very nice.  I've got to do a quick hello, too, before I forget.  When I got on the plane yesterday, I was met by three sheriffs, which was really frightening  because I walk off and I see three cops standing there.  And the one goes, Jim Norton?  And I'm like, yeah.  You know, I'm thinking, oh, Christ, you can look at the pictures on the laptop, you know?  I swear, I didn't know she was three.  My favorite shirt ever. 
[00:52:00]  So I walk up.  I get to say hello to the guys.  They walk me down.  I don't have the car with me.  I know there was Lieutenant Brian, and there was Captain Chad, and then there was Patrolman  Dan.  So thank you guys.  How did they know that you were getting off the plane?  Because Club Soda Kenny said on the air that I'll only fly Continental.  Wow.  And they knew and figured they would meet you there.  Just to say hello and get a picture.  They were all in uniform?  Yeah, all three of them were.  That must have been really scary.  Dude, I felt like either a criminal or a movie star walking down with three cops as bodyguards.  It was great.  You got hashish taped to your body, run to the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  You end up in a Turkish prison for some reason.  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony, continuing on from Mardi Gras 2005.  In this segment here, Tara Patrick is on the phone trying to promote a gig, but it's  too loud, so do we get to talk to her?  I don't know.  I didn't listen that far into this material.  I'm just reading off some notes that somebody handed me.  What else happened here?  She, da, da, da, da.  Who cares about her?  Oh, we used to have a former security, well, he's a former security guard now, but we used  to have a security guard named Master Poe, and for some of you old school listeners, 
[00:53:00]  this will be a most memorable segment, because this was where Master Poe started going on  the street and dancing with people.  He was an asshole.  And we hear about Jimmy's old bodybuilder friend, Stanley.  I know a lot of you probably remember the Stanley story.  Almost all of you probably don't.  It's new for you, and here it is.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we're back.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from Mardi Gras.  It is an absolute zoo down below us, man. 
[00:53:30]  We're on the balcony of the Crazy Horse, right?  Yes.  The zoo up here, too.  Jesus Christ.  And Jim Norton, as we were in break, just lost his effing mind.  I've never seen Norton more pissed off in my life.  What happened, Jimmy?  We got cups.  We got to throw down at people.  And we got beads.  Beads are meant to be whizzed at people.  I mean, I think that's fantastic.  But this fucking idiot is throwing cups at people.  And it's like, hey, stupid.  We're the only ones with yellow Opie and Anthony cups.  Who else has these?  They couldn't come from anywhere else. 
[00:54:00]  You can't whizz them at people.  Not only that, he pegged some, I think it was a lady in a wheelchair.  That was the only thing that kind of made me not angry,  is that he did hurt a person in a wheelchair.  I was like, all right, well, that's kind of funny.  But Tom is so just out of it.  He's completely hammered.  And he's just taking these cups and throwing them as hard as you can throw a plastic cup.  He has not trained.  It's really funny because Norton is losing his mind.  I mean, it's a known fact that Norton just hates Tom.  We all know that.  And now Tom is just babbling on a microphone that's not even working. 
[00:54:30]  Did you see that?  Well, actually, it's turned on, but it's actually rebelling against his breath.  It shut himself off.  It's like howling.  I hear you.  That's right.  Good timing.  Can you hear me?  What's up, Tom?  Can you hear me?  Yes.  I don't think Club Soda Kenny likes me too much.  He hates you.  He wants me out of here.  Yeah, he's going to bounce you in a few minutes.  And Norton asked him like, he's like.  No, you just can't throw cups really hard.  Ken, he's all right.  I hear you.  It's my saying.  Don't say it again.  Oh.  Okay.  This is going to be a fight.  And Norton was like, well, you know, Tom is kind of cool or not kind of cool, but I 
[00:55:00]  thought about Tom and, I mean, I don't know.  What do you think?  When did I say that?  What the hell did you say?  And I don't know what's going on.  No, you just can't whiz cups at people because they're going to know it's us.  Are they?  Yeah.  Okay.  How many times have you been in the Mardi Gras, Norton?  This is my second time.  Second time?  Yes.  Okay.  You're a rookie.  Oh, he's telling you, Jimmy.  Oh, he told you, Jimmy.  You are a rookie, Norton.  He knows you're able to do that.  I hate Mardi Gras.  You are a rookie, Norton.  Why was that?  Oh, my God.  I licked your head again.  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:30]  But I love you, Norton.  I'm a boy, Norton.  Norton, I love you.  He actually licked out of my headphones.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  You can't touch me.  I hate being touched.  I love you, Norton.  But I love you.  All right, club's up, Norton.  Kenny is going.  Jimmy, you want this piece of shit out of here?  Look, Guy Bannister was not as drunk in JFK when he beat up Jack Lemmon.  Visions tonight, Norton.  Tom is just harassing the hell out of Norton.  He has not changed. 
[00:56:00]  In a couple of years, we haven't seen him.  He is the same guy.  He is drunk.  I love you guys.  I love you guys.  We love you, too, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  I hate you guys.  Tom, take a breather.  What?  Take a little breather.  Yeah, in a garage with a car running.  Take a nice breather.  Take a walk for yourself.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  All right, Tom.  He's trying to give us the fisters, so I don't know what he's doing.  Kenny will throw him.  Don't harass another stripper, will you?  We're busy doing a broadcast.  Kenny will throw him off of this balcony. 
[00:56:30]  We've had one chick on the balcony so far, and he's been up here the whole time.  Can I stop popping on the microphone every time I say paced?  Don't worry about it.  I apologize to the listeners.  That's the least of our problems today.  I know.  That's annoying.  That's the least of our problems.  Is Tara Patrick on the line?  We've got Tara Patrick on the line, Anthony.  We were supposed to talk to her, what, Friday, I guess.  And we just ran out of show, so we wanted to get her on the air real fast.  All right.  So she could say hi to us.  Tara, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hi, Tara.  We have to apologize for Friday.  We just ran out of show. 
[00:57:00]  You guys got stuck in traffic on Long Island, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Of course.  And I think Evan was very, very mad at us, but we had no choice in the matter.  They cut off the show right at 10 o'clock, so there was nothing we could do.  Yeah, so don't have him beat us up or nothing.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  She can't hear you.  Can you pass it through better?  We're trying to.  We're at Mardi Gras, so it's kind of loud.  Oh, that's probably why there's so much background noise bleeding through. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  I'll have it try again.  All right.  Yeah, that's Evan.  Oh, wow.  Tara.  All right.  You know what?  Eric, just...  Eric, you got to get them on hold because we can't hear anything.  It's just a clusterf as it is here on Bourbon Street.  All right.  Tara Patrick will be at the Hustler Club doing a Mardi Gras party in New York City.  I'm so annoyed that I'm going to be down here instead of up there.  That's what we could have had up there.  Fucking one of the hottest porn stars ever. 
[00:58:00]  And instead, I'm down here with this drunk with awful teeth licking my head.  This climate stinks.  He's licked your head twice so far.  If he would have licked my head the second time, he hit the headphones.  Yeah, he had the headphones.  Well, the first time, he took his hand and just went like that.  Got a nice slobber on his hands.  I hate being a touch.  Tandesic waist.  And then just wiped it on the back of Norton's skull.  Disgusting.  At least you know you're not going to get poked by something like a toothbrush bristle that might have been in his mouth.  You know, if I can't find a good escort down here, maybe I'll lay on the bathroom floor and have Tom just lick my chest. 
[00:58:30]  It'll be the same thing I've done in New York, kind of.  And he doesn't understand that we really just don't like the guy.  But he loves us to death.  He'll do anything for us.  He's one of those kind of guys that really has no real friends.  But he has people that he thinks are friends.  And we're amongst those people.  He actually thinks we like him and we're just goofing on him.  But the fact of the matter is he's a repulsive human being that we want no part of.  And for some reason, he has nothing to do with XM, right?  No.  He's got nothing to do with us. 
[00:59:00]  But he has something to do with us broadcasting down here.  I have no clue how that happened.  Yeah, how did this come about?  Why is he involved with us again?  I understand why we had to deal with him last time because he was part of the station we were broadcasting from down here.  But wasn't there someone else we could have gone through to get us a spot here?  For some reason, that drunken ass has gotten us a really good spot.  And I hate the fact that that happened.  Could we have gotten somebody who drinks less like William Holden?  Kenny is just watching him like a hawk right now. 
[00:59:30]  Kenny is not happy.  And I like Tom.  I like the guy.  But it's like, stop touching me, dude.  I'm not joking.  I hate being touched.  See, he's the kind of guy that thinks it's a joke.  Yeah, he thinks it's funny.  Look, so I'll do it again.  I understand how radio works.  Well, the problem is he's known as the guy that licks people's head.  And we said that on the air.  So, of course, he wants to do his thing.  He's got to play it up now.  He's got to do his thing, you know?  Disgusting.  We were going to try to send Club Soda Kenny down to Bourbon Street to talk to the people. 
[01:00:00]  But I don't even know if we could possibly do that.  It is getting louder and louder here.  Yeah, I want Kenny here anyway to watch out and make sure he doesn't come over and touch me.  I like you, Norton.  All right, thank you, stupid.  Norton.  We should send him down there, though.  We should send somebody.  I don't know if we'll hear it or anything, but we should talk to some of these whores that are, you know, what's the most you would do for bees?  Things like that.  Kenny.  Kenny.  All right, Kenny's going down to the street right now with the wireless mic.  Get Master Paul up here to watch his area. 
[01:00:30]  Get Poe.  He'll take Tom's throat out.  That was so funny.  I guess Poe is giving lessons on how to make weapons.  Oh, yeah.  We forgot to talk about that.  At Newark Airport, we had about an hour and a half to kill, so we went to the diner.  And Poe's whole thing is, whoever he meets, he has to pretty much tell everyone how tough he is, okay?  Yeah.  I noticed this about Poe.  And then he has to give everyone that comes to the XM studio in New York lessons on how to defend themselves.  And one of his things is that you could kill somebody or hurt someone with just a piece of paper. 
[01:01:00]  Improvised weapons are his big thing.  So he was at the restaurant saying how he could make a deadly weapon out of a placemat.  Right.  You know, the paper placemats you get at a restaurant.  Right.  And I guess he showed everybody?  No, but that's the problem.  He just says, you know, you could pretty much hurt or kill somebody with just a piece of paper.  You have to wrap a gun in it.  And I was thinking, well, if you're in a confrontation with somebody and you don't have much time to think,  I don't think the move would be to take a piece of paper and start folding it into a weapon. 
[01:01:30]  Folding it?  Was that what it is?  You could fold it into a spike or something?  I guess we're going to have to maybe have him explain when we're back into a normal broadcast environment when we get back to New York.  But he swears that you can hurt someone really bad with just a piece of paper.  You know how you hurt somebody with a piece of paper?  You make it a contract and you put Tom's name on it.  And the weird thing about New York Airport, we're at the diner and, you know, you go through security and they're checking for weapons and stuff and they're x-raying everything, right? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  And then we sit down for a nice meal and we're using, you know, metal forks.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, that doesn't seem too smart.  It defeats the purpose.  Well, they're worried about your nail clippers and all that stupid stuff when you're going through security.  And you get through security and then there's plenty of weapons abound.  Yeah, and then Poe picks up the plastic knife and he goes, you can even use this as a weapon.  And we're like, how?  He goes, you slit their eye.  You slit their eye with the plastic knife.  Slit their eye?  And Kenny's like, but that's a really small target, you know? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, you kind of want to go for big targets.  Exactly.  All right, Club Soda Kenny is down on the street.  He's 6'5".  He's big and stupid.  He's turning on his mic.  I don't even know if this is going to work.  Talk to some people.  I think the wireless is having a problem.  Cut the wireless.  It ain't going to happen.  Oh, wait.  We got to turn.  We got to.  I don't know if this is going to work.  We got to put the hand on.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, we got it.  We got it.  Now, Kenny's.  All right.  All right, now.  Let's.  Another thing that's not going to work today. 
[01:03:00]  Don't tell him it's not working, though.  Just keep looking at him and smiling and he'll let him talk to a few people.  Yeah, do that.  Do that.  Just let him go.  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  He's wandering around.  No one can hear you, stupid.  Look, he's talking to people.  Let's throw beads at him.  Oh, you just hit that guy in the head.  Oh, very close.  All right.  Kenny.  Kenny's wandering around.  Kenny, good job.  Keep thumbs upping him.  I just gave him a thumbs up.  He's walking over to a beautiful girl now and she's talking and we have no idea what she's  saying because the wireless doesn't go far enough.  I'm going to try to hit him with these beads when he comes back. 
[01:03:30]  I got a big fistful of colorful, festive beads.  Girl's on a bicycle.  Oh, watch.  Let me hit Kenny.  Oh, I got him in the arm.  All right.  Well, that's another thing that's not going to work today.  It doesn't go on.  You know something?  It wouldn't be a broadcast from Mardi Gras if it wasn't a clusterfuck.  Wow.  Look at that girl.  She's completely topless with her boobies painted.  She's got pink hair.  Very nice.  Very big breasts.  Are we getting video of this stuff?  Oh, there's one.  It crushes teeth.  Where's Martini Steve? 
[01:04:00]  Is he filming this stuff?  No.  He is filming this?  I think there's a gang rape going on down there.  Yeah, it's kind of crazy when a girl like that, you know, walks by completely topless.  I mean, guys swarm around and it gets a little crazy down there.  Yeah.  Looks a little risky for the girls, but that's what it's all about.  It's a good look.  It's a good look.  Wow.  Those are big cans she got painted.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can knock her drink over.  There you go, whore.  All right.  Nice people just enjoying the festivities. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, did I ever tell you about my friend when I used to hang out with this bodybuilder named Stanley?  I was 13 and his brother Mike.  Is he real or was he like Helen?  He was a made-up one.  He would come in a cape and rescue me.  No, me, Stanley.  Stanley was like 25 and Mike was like 13 my age.  We would all play video games together.  It was like a molesting waitin' to happen, but Stan was just a nice guy.  But Michael was a sociopath, so we would ride around and throw things at people.  And one time we used to get cool whip cans, cool whip buckets.  Oh, right.  And put hot motor oil in them.  And I remember we were driving by some guy without his shirt.  And Michael was, hey, Stanley, let's leak some motor oil in it and throw it on his chest. 
[01:05:00]  And we drove by this chick one time and they had some Chinese food mustard.  And Michael was, hey, whore, have some mustard.  And he threw it at her and he smashed it right in the face with Chinese mustard.  One time we were in a pickup truck and they had a couch in the back.  So he lit the couch on fire and pushed it out onto the highway, hoping somebody would crash into it and be killed.  What an ass.  Hey, whore, have some mustard.  My favorite thing ever.  What an absolute ass. 
[01:05:30]  That's kind of what this is like, winging things down.  You think I can hit her cup out of her hand or that guy's cup?  Damn, I'm short.  That's stung.  You're out of practice.  I love the looks you get from these people as you hit them with the beads.  Oh, look at that.  Those girls look like they washed up on a Phuket beach.  A lot of those going on.  The festivity is really, really getting underway now.  When do they shut down the traffic?  Because there's still a lot of cars driving through here.  We keep throwing things in their windows, hoping to knock out the driver so he hits the gas and runs over a crowd of people right in front of us. 
[01:06:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, continuing from Mardi Gras 2005.  And in this segment, Club Soda Kenny is still on the street.  He's trying to meet people.  We're going to pretty much wrap up day one of all the festivities here.  Ant's going to take the whole staff out to dinner, so we'll hear some stories in the next segment about what happened.  Tom from New Orleans, our old GM, is still hanging around and annoying the piss out of everybody. 
[01:06:30]  And I hope you enjoy it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program live from Mardi Gras.  And we're broadcasting here.  Why?  At this point.  Because it's a party, Opie.  Because it's a huge party.  We're at the Crazy Horse.  We're on a balcony.  It's just getting crazy.  And now it's starting to rain.  Yeah, the rain has come.  Some of the people are scattering from the sides of the road.  It almost feels like an act of God just to clear the shithole out. 
[01:07:00]  Wash away the stink.  Well, we got Big and Stupid on Bourbon Street right now.  He's on the wireless mic.  Is it going to work now?  Hey.  Club Soda Kenny is on the street.  And he's going to talk to some people.  Let's see if this works.  Jaime said it's going to work.  Am I good?  It's good.  I'm on the street.  I'm going to talk.  Hey, talk on the radio.  Hello.  Say something about Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras rules.  Where are you from?  Iowa.  Iowa farmer.  See ya.  You want to talk on the radio?  Say hello.  Hi. 
[01:07:30]  I just nailed her in the face.  Holy shit.  Hey.  Dumb as shit.  Hi.  I have no voice.  So you're a hot chick.  I'm a fucking hungover chick.  Hi.  He's just mugging people.  All right.  I'm finding a lot of people.  Everybody's throwing stuff at me.  Yeah.  That's not cool.  He is just mugging people.  Yeah.  Good.  It'll be an improvement.  He was talking to a girl.  Let me talk to some more chicks.  I hit her right in the face. 
[01:08:00]  Here.  Say hello on the radio.  Hi.  The trick is to hit the girls he's talking to.  Yeah.  He does hit me right on the head.  Come on.  Say hello on the radio.  Oh, God.  That just hit the phone.  And they just nailed the microphone.  Kissimmee, Florida.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Hello.  Come on.  Talk to someone.  Hello.  Hello.  Oh, damn.  Hey, you want to say something for Mark?  See you instead of like? 
[01:08:30]  What?  Oh, you're an asshole.  What is he doing?  He's still fucking throwing them.  You want to say hello on the radio?  Get low up here.  Come on.  Say something for Mark.  All right.  That's.  You got to hit the people in the face that he's talking to.  All right.  I'm going to find some more people.  All right.  Wait.  Here's another fact check.  We're going to start getting live from Bird Street.  Hi.  Hi.  Am I ready?  Hit her in the face.  What's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  You guys when you're in New York.  You're listening now on the XM?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Where are you from?  New Orleans.  Go for yo. 
[01:09:00]  That's right.  Here you go.  Have some mustard, whore.  Texas.  Yes.  Texas.  Texas.  Yeah.  Did you show anybody your tits yet?  Yeah.  No.  No.  She didn't.  She didn't.  No.  All right.  Coach O'Neill is getting completely attacked by the beads.  Show them your tits.  I need some good beads.  Don't throw your beads.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Get us out of this, Jaime.  Thank you.  We have crappy beads to give out.  That is really funny.  All the sound you're hearing were the beads hitting the girls in the face. 
[01:09:30]  As Club Soda Kenny is trying to interview them.  It's starting to rain pretty bad out there.  It's turning into like a wet t-shirt contest now.  That's not a good thing.  No.  And it's getting louder and louder.  Yeah.  Oh, what is this?  Oh, good.  This is the police department.  Wow.  Tolling down in the middle of Bourbon Street.  Wow.  These guys don't even slow down for people.  Look at this.  Why is Grady from Sanford and Son hanging out the back of that truck?  I've seen more Grady's from Sanford and Son in this city. 
[01:10:00]  Wow.  Look at this thing.  Guy or girl.  Can't even tell from here.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  All right.  We're live at Mardi Gras, Crazy Horse, Bourbon Street.  It's raining.  People are getting drunker.  It's raining.  It's a mess.  Yeah, it is.  But I like the smell that's now wafting up from the steaming street from the rain.  Mmm.  That's nice.  That was actually Tom talking.  This guy's got, like, they got doctor scrubs on, and he's got a big dildo sticking out of 
[01:10:30]  his pants, and he's beating girls with it as they walk down the sidewalk.  He just beat the ass of that hot blonde right there.  That is wonderful.  Pretty much anything goes in Mardi Gras.  We've seen that.  I think we should start a bead war with that other balcony over there.  You want to start whaling something?  We better get some artillery, because they really have a lot of big, heavy beads.  We got, like, little BB beads.  The girls don't even want them.  I think we've ran out of beads.  Yeah.  Hey, that girl's got a red hurricane.  Where?  I got some green thing.  I want a red hurricane.  God damn it.  Wasn't the green thing a hand grenade or whatever they're called? 
[01:11:00]  A hand grenade.  It's a hand grenade.  What about the hurricane?  Yeah, the hurricanes are the red ones.  We need a few hurricanes.  We need some hurricanes.  By the way, Norton is late coming back to the broadcast, because I saw him in the hall,  like, negotiating with one of the strippers.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Are you kidding already?  Norton, I noticed you were negotiating with one of the fine young ladies that works here  with the crazy horse.  Well, I asked somebody how much a lap dance was, and they said for up here, it's $40.  Are you kidding? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  So I said lap dance is not happening.  They got some very interesting rooms up here.  They're kind of like cubicles with just couches in them.  You notice that?  Now, you don't know what's happening, though, Jimmy.  What's that?  That might be a bargain.  I know what's happening.  He knows what's happening.  Yeah.  Are you going to taste the local fare while you're down here?  Yeah, I'm going to walk around and see what's going on.  Yeah, I want a lap dance badly.  By the way, where are we eating dinner tonight on Anthony's Tab?  I'm paying.  You pick this place.  I don't care where we go.  I just don't want to walk through, like, you know, masses like that. 
[01:12:00]  No, we figured this out.  Find a good spot.  You get off Bourbon Street, it gets much cooler.  We had a great time at House of Blues the first night we were here, and then we found  out Greg Allman's playing tomorrow night.  I think we're going to go check that out after the broadcast.  At House of Blues?  Yeah.  Very cool.  Let's go.  That's going to be awesome.  And then we found this dive bar that was pretty cool with the jukebox.  There was nothing going on in there, but the music was great.  All right.  I don't know.  I guess we're kind of wrapping up the festivities here from Mardi Gras.  Festivus, Jerry.  I can't even hear myself. 
[01:12:30]  So what are we doing tonight?  We're going to check out the dancers here for a while?  I think what we'll do is kind of hang around a little bit after the show, go inside, check  out some of the dancers.  I want to see how that dancer that's on the rag moves.  I want to see her moves.  How she figures that whole thing out, right?  To keep from any leakage.  After she gets off the stage, it looks like a Japanese flag.  What's up with the sirens below us?  Anybody?  They're looking for Tom.  They're looking for Tom, probably. 
[01:13:00]  I guess we've got to get Tom back on the air.  I know Jimmy doesn't want this.  He was yelling before.  Let's get Tom.  When everybody went for a break and I was sitting here, he came over.  You've got to get me back on the air for real with the headphones.  None of that bullshit on the air.  And he's bringing him in by another stripper I see, too.  Oh, is he molesting her, too?  We've got to call them dancers, actually.  For some reason, something happened with the strippers thing.  They don't want to be called strippers anymore.  They want to be called exotic dancers.  Wow.  I'm seeing a girl walk down and I am going to put these beads right in that cleavage.  You're going to give it a shot, Anthony? 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to give it a shot.  She's got to have at least double Ds.  Here we go.  It's wobbling.  Oh!  That was really close.  Who did that one?  That's the girl I was going to get, you bastards.  All right.  You're at the shot of the day, by the way.  Anthony, you threw beads so hard before that they ended up around the girl's necks.  Yeah.  And that neck just spun around once and landed it perfectly.  I've got to ring her.  Oh, my God.  What is this mess?  What does she want?  Here you go.  I'm going to throw him a cup.  There you go.  Take the cup.  She can drink her Geritol out of it.  Yeah.  Her husband's 80.  Here, sir.  Here's an XM prostate for you. 
[01:14:00]  Let's say hi to Tom from New Orleans.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Tom.  You're not supposed to be touching the strippers or the dancers, I should say.  The dancers.  Hey, what's her name?  Huh?  What's your name, baby?  My name's Carly.  Carly.  Wow.  She's absolutely beautiful.  She is beautiful.  Tom.  What are you doing, baby?  Don't worry.  Tom.  She just got really pissed off.  Yeah.  She got really, really pissed.  He just casually had his arm around her, and then he just felt her up.  I know.  He started grabbing her breast. 
[01:14:30]  Tom, you got to treat the girls with some respect.  I do.  I do.  She's dancing now up here.  She could shave her armpits a little bit.  Wow.  That's heroin chic, isn't it?  Yeah.  Tom, does she have a nice hiney?  Yeah, a great hiney.  How does her hiney look?  She won't show it.  It should turn around.  Look at that.  Oh, Tom's going to stick a thumb in it.  A lot of plumb.  I've got Steve C.  What an awful man he is.  He's checking out all the girls.  You're like, yo, guys, this one ain't bleeding.  What about going on?  What about going on, Tiny?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Why does he have to touch?  Why is he always touching you, Jimmy?  Jimmy, stop it.  Jimmy, I love you.  Jimmy, make my week and punch him in his face.  I almost did when he licked the headphones before.  Oh, yeah.  But I knew if I did, Kenny would jump in and kill him.  Make my week.  Kenny would kill him.  You actually were protecting him by not hitting him like that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I want to have fun with you tonight, buddy.  He's patting you now.  He's patting you.  I love the fun.  Tom, what's the rest of your night going to be like?  I think we're going to go out and have a couple of drinks with Jimmy and Ben.  What's this weed shit?  Not you.  Not you with your girlfriend now. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  I got to vacuum and get divorced and then got my girlfriend.  Tom, that was going on the last time he was here.  I know.  Where have you been?  Well, you're coming tonight.  I'm not hanging out with you.  You're coming tonight.  I'm not hanging out with you.  Opie.  When was the last time you were sober?  Seriously, because this whole Marty Thread thing happens all year long.  This morning at like 5 a.m. when I woke up.  That was it.  You drink every day, right?  Yeah.  Pretty much every day?  Yeah.  And Bourbon Street's like this almost every day, right? 
[01:16:00]  No.  No, it's just wild every day.  No.  On the weekends, though?  No?  Yeah.  It's wild on the weekends.  What's the drug of choice for tonight?  Hallucinogenics.  Going to do a little shroom action?  Well, hey, Tom.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  There goes, Tom.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I lack him on my pizza.  I'm sorry.  I was talking to the back of the garbage truck.  Hey, I'm Don Cog with Tom Brady.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Why don't we take the headphones?  All right.  I love you, guys.  Tom, thank you.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  Keep it away from Tom.  You guys are great.  Thank you for the great spot here at Mardi Gras.  You guys rock.  You guys rock.  And I hope we party tonight.  All right.  We'll make sure we do not party with you tonight.  But thanks for the offer.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  His headphones are off.  Yeah.  We're not going out.  Absolutely not.  He is.  My chick came up to me and said, Tom is so wasted.  He came up to her and said, hey, I am taking mushrooms and I am so hallucinating.  Right now he is?  Yeah.  So he's not even waiting until later. 
[01:17:00]  He's already taking something.  Oh, he's giving you the finger.  You can't hear anything.  Club Soda Kenny, remove this guy.  He's becoming a problem.  Remove him right now.  Look at Kenny.  If he thinks he's getting me a Hummer, that's not happening.  I'd rather have Ope get me a Hummer by giving me Ant.  All right.  Deal.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, that guy's cup right there.  Watch.  Oh, that was really close.  And then they all look up at me and they want to kill me. 
[01:17:30]  I had nothing to do with that.  I'm pointing.  You don't know how to look away, dude.  You got to look away when that happens.  Take the quick glance.  Get your joy out of it.  It hit the cup directly, but.  Oh.  Let's go with the lady in the wheelchair.  Lady in the wheelchair smoking a cigarette.  She looked like she needed a Ope and Anthony beer mug.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  She's in a wheelchair chain smoking.  Chain smoking.  That's really smart.  That's fine.  Why don't you throw her down a couple of good feet?  Yeah, this is the end of the program, guys. 
[01:18:00]  This is what you get today.  This is it.  And tomorrow.  And tomorrow.  It's going to be worse tomorrow.  It's going to be louder.  You know what this shows us?  That we were right last time we were here.  That we should never broadcast from morning girl.  Oh, we're never coming back again.  Remember three years ago, we left here.  We had a good time.  And we went, all right, we'll never do that again.  We'll never come back.  The broadcast stinks.  It just doesn't make sense.  I think it was fun today.  We actually had a pretty good time.  It's a lot of fun. 
[01:18:30]  And it's only three hours.  I mean, Jesus.  It's just funny, though.  Like, after 10 minutes, everyone forgets that we're trying to do a radio show.  And they're on the balcony trying to talk to us.  They talk to you.  Trying to hand us drugs and drinks.  Guys from the streets.  Look at this guy.  He's yelling at us.  And they talk to you.  Right.  And we can't hear what they say.  And then they throw us the finger because we can't hear them.  Yeah, like they're trying to carry on a conversation.  We're doing a show here.  Right.  We're doing a show and, well, what we think is a show.  Hey, what's up?  God, we have a lot of fans here. 
[01:19:00]  Why are people so into cups?  I never knew that was a thing here at Mardi Gras.  People want free things.  Is it just free stuff?  Dude, if you were throwing colon cancer off the balcony, they'd be running with their  arms up to grab it.  It's amazing.  Colostomy bags.  Here comes the Asian girl with a tree right through her.  Throwing used colostomy bags.  Hopefully it would hit Tom in the mouth to make it smell better.  Use it as mouthwash.  He's the only guy that would go to the dentist.  The dentist would go, all right, rinse.  No, just swallow it.  You should take some of these huge beads and floss with it. 
[01:19:30]  You know, Club Soda Kenny has a dentist joke, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  I've been reminded that Club Soda Kenny might have a dentist joke.  Kenny.  All right.  Kenny's getting his headphones on.  We all love Kenny's jokes.  Kenny's taking his job very serious today.  I like that.  Doing it very well.  I like that a lot.  We haven't seen any flashing lately, Anthony.  No.  Girls are getting free stuff here is what it is.  Kenny, do you have a dentist joke in honor of Tom from New Orleans?  I hate him.  You don't like him at all, right?  Kenny is really not liking him. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, Kenny, think of it this way.  You know how you feel about Tom?  That's how XM feels about you.  Isn't that awful?  That is bad.  Now you can kind of see what type of hatred is going on there.  Listen, I heard you talk about Michael Jackson the other day.  May I make an observation?  Certainly.  Do you know what the difference between Michael Jackson and acne is?  What?  Acne comes on your face after you're 13.  Wow.  What?  Very good. 
[01:20:30]  What about the dentist joke in honor of Tom?  Oh.  You know what time a Chinaman goes to the dentist?  What time?  2.30.  2.30.  Yeah.  I get it.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right in the drink.  Dude, it was a direct hit that went right into the guy's drink.  One hit him in the face.  The rest went right in the drink, and he is pissed.  That was a good one.  What a direct hit. 
[01:21:00]  Now he's throwing him back at the wrong side of the balcony.  Good.  That's fine.  Wow.  Broadcasting.  I'm holding cups.  Did that hit perfect.  I'm glad I got a direct hit.  Dude, that actually went right through to Governor Connolly's back.  See, why didn't he just throw the beads at him while he was coming up instead of waiting  for him to turn on Elm?  That was a tough shot.  Hey, that balcony's getting a lot more action than we are as far as the girls flashing.  Yeah, because we're not asking for it.  We're just kind of giving the girls stuff. 
[01:21:30]  Let's get Martini Steve on the air before we get out of here for the night.  Martini Steve.  Oh, an open cup walking by, and I missed it.  Martini Steve, you ready to drink tonight or what?  We'll see.  We'll see.  I have to.  I've been very responsible for the last 48 hours.  I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.  Well, it wasn't 48 hours, but I'm 36.  Oh, Super Bowls.  Hold on.  I got to bounce this thing.  Bounce it hard, LP.  Don't hit anybody with it.  Bounce it.  Come on, bounce.  Oh, hit the roof. 
[01:22:00]  And there it goes.  Point, point, point, into the sleeves.  You know that's coming back up to the balcony.  Steve, you going to have a couple of martinis tonight with us?  We'll see.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Ant's paying if he doesn't go back to the room.  Oh, really?  I'm out.  It's on me.  I'm going out.  Oh, really?  I'm out tonight.  Fantastic.  Fantastic, then.  Oh, now they're looking at me.  I was going to wing it into her drink.  Why don't we wrap this mess up that we call the Rokin Anthony program?  Is that a kid or like a fidget? 
[01:22:30]  A fidget standing next to the big guy?  Yeah.  And then I pointed, and then that guy who I believe is the father of that looked up and  gave me the look of death.  No, it's a father and son.  It is a son.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a little Webster.  It looks like, yeah, like a little Webster, actually.  It's like a mini version of the father.  Oh, he's leaving the kid alone.  Oh, no, no.  See, that's the mother there.  All right.  Why don't we wrap this up, like we said, about five times?  It's opening a cowboy hat.  Cowboy hat. 
[01:23:00]  We'll do this all over again tomorrow.  Live from Bourbon Street in New Orleans.  New Orleans.  It's Mardi Gras.  And thanks for listening.  We'll see you tomorrow.  No, I'm not waiting this time, Jimmy.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Serious.  XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is Erock.  We're playing back Mardi Gras 2005 for the Opie and Anthony show.  This is day two of the two-day broadcast from down there for Mardi Gras on Fat Tuesday.  Our former producer, Steve C., Steve the Bear, Martini Steve, who used to have a really big 
[01:23:30]  drinking problem and sobered up and who knows what he's doing nowadays.  But at this point, he had food poisoning from going out to dinner last night.  Master Poe is still out on Bourbon Street trying to teach girls how to dance.  He's touching them.  He's putting stickers in places that he shouldn't be putting them.  We hear about all the horror stories about going out to dinner.  And once again, our former GM from our New Orleans affiliate, Tom, is there grossing out  everybody and everyone hates him.  This is the worst.  This is the worst. 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to be in the virus.  Serious.  XM.  It's funny.  We move the show inside for now and then we're going to go out on this balcony.  And I was looking at Anthony before the show and Anthony goes, I will never be back here  again.  Yeah.  We've said that in the past.  We said it last time we were here.  For some reason, we came back.  Technically, I think it's working better.  But the same stuff.  I mean, the same stuff that kept us from wanting to come back again is firmly in place.  Yep.  The stench, the belligerent drunks, and I'm just talking about our own crew that we brought 
[01:24:30]  with us.  And I looked at Steve.  I didn't mean that, Steve.  Yeah, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Steve is under the weather and it's not because of alcohol poisoning today.  Nothing to do with booze.  He ate something, I guess.  I guess he has some kind of food poisoning happening.  And I'm scared because I had the same thing he did last night at dinner, which we'll get  into in a minute here.  And he's really sick.  He's got the Pepto-Bismos and Bismo.  Bismo-Bismos.  Pepto-Bismos. 
[01:25:00]  And he's way under the weather, definitely.  I am green.  It has nothing to do with the drinking.  No, it has nothing.  No, no, no, no.  Maybe that olive was bad in the martini.  Yeah, that one olive in that one martini.  No, there was nothing.  And it may have something to do with my little reduced anatomy.  That's true.  That is making this.  Your penis?  What?  Yes, thank you.  My small penis is making this food poisoning.  It may have to be exponentially worse.  Yeah, for the new listeners, Martini Steve has a very, very tiny stomach.  He used to weigh about 400 pounds.  What are you down to, 260? 
[01:25:30]  260, 265 now.  So, and he can't handle his food.  He had it banded or something, right?  Yeah.  In essence, they put a cock ring around your stomach.  Exactly.  And this cock ring around my stomach is preventing me from vomiting up whatever nastiness I have  inside me.  So, it gets, I can't puke it up.  So, it just gets, I try to, and it gets stuck coming back.  It's just got to work its way back out the other end, right?  Exactly.  You know, like a horse.  He can't throw up.  He just stands there and eats oats until he dies.  Creep.  You know, I got to acknowledge one thing. 
[01:26:00]  Does XM realize that this is a complete waste of time?  No.  I mean, we've been in such a great flow back in New York.  The radio show has been rocking.  We're really throwing some great radio programs at the listeners and stuff.  And then they sent us down here.  Into a combat zone.  To just kind of party and just talk about it.  Hang out.  Like, we have a ton of stuff we could talk about, but we're not going to get any real  radio done today.  No.  If we were back in the studio, yeah, we would be talking about the news, things like that.  We don't even have a newspaper.  I have not seen a newspaper since we've been here.  I have not even scanned over a newspaper since we've been here. 
[01:26:30]  Who is that?  Steve's stomach?  Yeah, Steve.  What are you doing?  Want a newspaper.  All right.  Yeah.  Get the USA Today or something.  There are actually newspapers around here.  Well, who the hell can read here in New Orleans?  So, but I just want to acknowledge that because it was so frustrating because yesterday we're  trying to do a radio show.  And then Anthony and I realized, what are we doing?  It's all about just drinking, looking at girls' tits, and trying to knock drinks out of  people's hands with the beads.  Which is fine if you're not doing a radio show.  Right.  Because before the show started, we were doing just that. 
[01:27:00]  And me and Jimmy, at least, didn't want to even start the show.  We wanted to stay out there and throw beads.  We are the, Jimmy said it, we are the assholes here.  We are the assholes here.  Out of everyone here at Mardi Gras, we are the assholes.  Everyone else is throwing the beads out to people.  We're holding them in our fists, clumped in a ball, staring at people, trying not to  let them see us.  And then when someone puts their head down with an open drink down the street, we fire at  them.  And if you can knock that drink out of your hand, we laugh like retards. 
[01:27:30]  And it is the best feeling when you leave someone covered in Bloody Mary, wondering, you  know, I had a drink a second ago.  Yeah.  And now it's just completely gone.  It is the best thing.  And we were laughing our asses off.  And the best part, you guys have been like nailing people with headshots and things like  that.  And then they look up and they see the beads on the ground and they pick them up and go,  thank you.  Yeah.  And then they kind of think.  Like they have no idea that they're just a moving target.  You know, me, Jimmy, your brother, we're going for the drinks.  Very small target.  Very strategic. 
[01:28:00]  I kind of called it out.  I was pointing and I was saying fat pig in the green shirt.  That was code for throw beads at her.  And I was trying to knock her drink out.  And then stupid sociopath just starts throwing them at her fat back.  It was kind of funny.  It made a whipping sound when it hit her.  So it's going to happen.  We're going to try to do a little radio.  Then we're going to go out on the balcony.  And this whole show is just going to be commentary as we try to nail people with beads.  Yeah.  That's what it degenerates to.  Let's lower the expectations.  If you're out there in radio land expecting a great Mardi Gras broadcast from Opie and Anthony, 
[01:28:30]  it ain't going to happen.  Maybe we'll have an interview with some of the float people, the people that go on the floats in the parade.  Or we'll talk to maybe the mayor of New Orleans.  He'll come up and tell us about Mardi Gras and how it's changed over the years.  Well, it is Fat Tuesday.  Does anyone even know what that means?  Nope.  It's Tuesday at Lady Di's house.  No, I have no clue.  That's Fat Drunk Tuesday.  It's just an excuse to let people dress up in the most whacked out costumes you'll ever see.  It gives carte blanche. 
[01:29:00]  It's Halloween out there.  Yeah.  Guys are dressing like fairies, but it's okay because it's Fat Tuesday.  This is one of those days like Halloween in the village in New York City that just is an open invitation to gay guys  to completely come out of the closet and dress like gay people, like slutty fags.  Right.  I saw a guy walking down the street.  What the hell was he wearing?  He had an open-ass chaps on.  Oh, no.  He had like a cook apron. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One guy was wearing a cook apron with nothing on the back.  And a chicken mask.  And a chicken head mask.  And he was choking a chicken.  He had like a rubber chicken, and then his hairy ass was there for everybody.  Waiting for him to see him giving a BJ at the Overlook Hotel to open up the door.  Great party.  The best part about that, there was an old lady following the guy, just taking snapshots of his ass as he's walking to bring home with her.  Laws go out the window.  People just drunk.  I mean, the drunks that come to this thing. 
[01:30:00]  Because you wouldn't come here unless you're a drunk.  No.  Well, Club Starter Kenny said, walking back from breakfast, he said, this is the land of the raging alcoholic.  Yeah.  It absolutely is.  People just drink at all hours.  The bar in the hotel opens at, when are they open?  Like 6?  6 in the morning.  The bar at the hotel.  You don't even have to go to the actual bar.  They have a wet bar set up right in the lobby.  The bar in the lobby of the hotel.  In case you can't get to the bar in the hotel.  If you need a drink before you can even get to the bar, which is probably 20 feet away. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  If you're in the lobby going, I need a drink now.  Yeah, they put a bar in the lobby for you.  I think people come down here just to justify their alcoholism.  Yeah.  Because they walk around at 7 in the morning with these just hurricanes and the craziest blood.  A lot of bloodies.  The spiciest Bloody Marys you'll ever drink in your life.  Look at me.  Yeah.  And they look at each other like, oh, see, I am normal after all.  Yeah.  Everyone else is like me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a big group hug for drunks.  Here's all you need to know about Louisiana.  The state bird is a bloated liver.  By the way, we finally found something that Master Poe is good at. 
[01:31:00]  We finally found something you're good at.  We're calling Master Poe, the master emcee.  He's out on Bourbon Street as we're up here doing a radio show, handing out WoW stickers.  Like, I've never seen anyone hand out WoW stickers.  And he's starting, like, a whole line dancing thing in the middle of the street with girls  Danny Terrio with a gi.  Right.  He's not handing them out.  He's taking the WoW sticker out, and he's getting girls to bend over, and he's, like,  gently taking his time putting it on their ass and sending them off with a WoW sticker  on their ass.  But you see what he does before he even sticks it on their ass? 
[01:31:30]  Like, the girls bend over.  And normally, you would just bend at your knees or maybe bend at your waist to get low  enough to put the sticker on.  He bends down into this pose like when someone in the Matrix comes down from high height and  they land on the ground in that cool little unique squat pose.  That's how Poe poses.  And then slowly wipes the sticker on.  He's got a whole ritual that he does.  And then he actually had a dance line going in the middle of Bourbon Street.  He got girls together, all WoWs all over him, about five girls behind him. 
[01:32:00]  And he starts dancing, and the girls are, you know, copying his little dance to a spontaneous  dance number.  And then he grabbed the wireless mic from the bar across the way, and he's just making just  announcements to all at Bourbon Street that we're broadcasting live.  And you would think we would appreciate this and sit there and go, wow, Poe is really tearing  it up, doing a good job.  No.  Opie starts getting fistfuls of beads and pelting Poe with damn good shots, I must say.  We're completely across Bourbon Street, and Poe is on the other side of Bourbon Street. 
[01:32:30]  And Opie nailed him first shot square in the top of his head.  Well, I'm a frustrated pitcher.  I wanted a pitch when I was growing up.  It was fantastic.  And then Poe went to point another time, and Opie had just thrown it.  And the beads went around his finger.  It was a great shot.  It was an amazing shot.  I've got to give myself credit on that one.  And that's what we've been doing, throwing beads at people.  Yeah.  So it's a lot of fun.  We're at the Crazy Horse.  Last night after the show, we went downstairs, checked out some of the local talent.  I hung last night.  I was out of the room.  I hung for the duration.  I got an announcement. 
[01:33:00]  Howard Hughes left his hotel room and hung out with us last night.  I had my Purell.  And you were spending money like Howard Hughes, too.  I had my boy in the plastic bubble suit that I walked around in.  Oh, I was spending money like Howard Hughes.  Dude, you're, I mean, it's getting ridiculous.  Because we walked out of the front door of the hotel.  Well, no, we had to go out the side door or whatever.  And the smell was too bad for Anthony.  So he wanted to walk all the way around the block, even though we had to go, like, what,  30 yards to the left?  It was so disgusting when we walked out of that hotel, the stench of vomit and garbage. 
[01:33:30]  And I would love to be able to really convey that to the audience, but you can't.  This is a smell that you cannot even convey.  A picture, maybe, if you just were up vomiting all night into the back of a garbage truck and  Tom from New Orleans breathed on you.  And then dumped stale beer on the puke.  Yeah, yeah, stale beer on the puke.  Have you used your hotel sponge yet?  No, I haven't.  They give you sponges for your shoes to wash your shoes off.  Yeah, in every room you get a little shoe sponge that you could use to wipe off your 
[01:34:00]  shoes.  All I know is I had to wash my hat off last night, which is saying something.  I had gunk on my hat.  And when gunk is spewing up that high, God knows where it was coming from.  I think that was last night when we, what did we do last night when we got back to the  hotel?  Oh, that's right.  We stood out on the balcony and threw beads at people.  We somehow got into the Southern Comfort Party and then just, like, elbowed our way up to  the balcony and started just throwing beads at people.  Kenny absconded an entire box of beads.  They smelled like cat urine.  They smelled like cat urine, the beads. 
[01:34:30]  Smelt like cat pits.  So we had big fistfuls of these.  And again, we were just throwing them, heaving them at people's drinks and cackling like  idiots.  Norton is having a great time with this.  Because you usually don't like to hang either.  But you found something you're really into.  I'm loving it, too.  You're obsessing about just knocking the drinks out of people's hands with the beads.  All I'm thinking about is what time the first break is so I can begin pelting people with  the heavier beads that we have.  We have good, heavy beads.  Oh, I called one that I had before.  I was with Brett, OB's brother.  And I was like, dude, I got the Bunker Busters.  And just wadded it up. 
[01:35:00]  It was the size of like a cantaloupe in my hand.  And some guy walked by.  And it's really hard to miss when you got beads like that.  Because they just spread out when you throw them.  And I nailed this guy.  And I swear to God, he looked like it just zapped and disappeared from his hand.  He had no clue where it went, what happened.  And again, the laughter ensued up on the balcony as we hide like faggots.  We just cowardly duck back.  We duck back so they can't see us.  My brother's a good shot, no?  Oh, he's been scoring some great hits.  Yeah.  Great hits.  It's a fun game.  Well, so after the show, we went downstairs and got some lap dances, hung out with some 
[01:35:30]  of the strippers and stuff.  And then, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I was trying to, I actually felt like I was staying away from you guys.  And I didn't mean to do that.  But I was trying to stay away from Tom from New Orleans.  Now, Tom set this up for us here on this balcony.  He got us a great spot.  So for that, thank you, Tom.  For anything else, you're a mess, a disaster, and a pain in the ass to hang out with.  So right after we're done with the show, and during yesterday's show, mind you, he was 
[01:36:00]  constantly annoying us.  Yeah.  Constantly annoying us.  The times you heard him annoying us on the air, that was only on the air.  Off the air, he was constantly annoying us to where Club Soda Kenny was ready to just  treat him like beads and lob him into the crowd.  Just a pain in the ass.  So when the show gets done, we all go downstairs to watch some dancers.  I sit down with my girlfriend and Jimmy.  You guys are still upstairs for a little while.  And I came down so quickly because I didn't want to stay up here with Tom.  So we sit down there. 
[01:36:30]  You guys gather in the corner.  And Tom goes over by you guys.  So now I didn't want to come over there and hang with Tom because he's a pain in the ass.  So I'm just looking over occasionally, watching him molest the dancers.  Just grabbing him like a bowling ball.  His fingers are wandering into their ass cracks.  They're all upset.  They're going to jump off of him.  I got to tell you, though, he's got the move because he makes it look like it's by accident.  But you know, he knows exactly what he's doing.  He was feeling up girls.  He was like, you know, rubbing their intimate areas.  He's grabbing crunch. 
[01:37:00]  And then the girl will get pissed off.  He's like, oh, I'm sorry.  Like he acts all naive and stuff.  But he had to move down.  I saw a girl push his hand away from her crotch.  As that hand was being pushed away, his other hand wrapped around and grabbed her tits.  It's like this guy's got the nerve.  You've got to respect that.  She's fighting him off.  He's like a rapist in slow motion.  And he's just getting hammered.  I think he was on shrooms yesterday.  He was talking about mushrooms.  And then he wants to drive 12 of us to another strip club where you get, what, free BJs or something? 
[01:37:30]  I know a place where you can get blowjob, boys.  It's going to be great.  Just hop in my vehicle.  I'll drive.  I would sooner get in a car in the 70s with Billy Martin than with this guy.  Who was driving with him?  You could not be drunk enough.  Maybe Steve.  You could not be drunk enough.  Unless you're a technician at XM, maybe.  Did you get in the car with him?  Jaime got in the car with him at the dinner? 
[01:38:00]  You must have been hammered.  Either that or you didn't see enough of Tom to understand he was.  I was called in, told I got a surprise for you by a certain person who's downstairs dancing like a fucking monkey right now.  I won't mention his name.  Paul, I got a great surprise for you.  You got to meet me.  Go to the place where you guys were having dinner.  Yeah.  Pops out of his whatever.  He was laying on the fucking floor.  I told him, hey, let's go party, guys.  I'm like, oh, shit.  That was my surprise for the night.  And then you had to get in a vehicle with him?  Needless to say, it was really shitty. 
[01:38:30]  Wait, you drove with him?  No, he wasn't driving.  Somebody else said, that guy was driving.  Oh, that guy.  It was even worse.  I'm sure he was a great day.  I'm going to love him today.  Oh, is that the guy wearing the same shirt he had on last night?  Exactly.  My whole goal at dinner was, because he's a super fan, was to piss him off to the point that he'll never listen to us again.  Oh, this guy.  You really pissed him off.  We are at this place, and all they're talking about is the show.  And I'm like, look, beautiful girls.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Well, we're terrible.  I'm going to sit next to him at dinner.  Yeah, we'll explain. 
[01:39:00]  And he didn't shut up about the show.  So then Anthony is a man of his word.  We went to dinner on his tab last night.  Yeah, well, you didn't finish the story downstairs.  Oh, there was more to it?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Oh, Tom then gets, and this was the beginning of what I saw also at dinner.  Tom decides, well, we're all going to drink, obviously.  The shot girl starts coming over.  And he's like, come on, shots for everybody.  Shots.  We're all doing shots.  So I figured those things are pretty small, and the sour apples are really good.  My girlfriend was having a couple, Steve maybe. 
[01:39:30]  And so we do all the shots up.  Give it to the shot girl.  And we start, you know, looking at the dancers and talking again.  Well, then the shot girl comes over and goes, I'm really sorry, but that's $15 for the shots.  And I look over and go, I thought Tom had these.  And not like I thought Tom had these, get the money from them, but I just wanted to know what happened.  I thought Tom had these.  And, no, he said, no, he's not paying for them. 
[01:40:00]  So I'm like, all right, no problem.  I give the girl, you know, a 20 or whatever.  She says, thank you.  For the rest of the night, she's apologizing to me that this scumbag was, you know, Welshing.  And he was the one that said, you know, shots for everybody.  Lap dance is fair.  He gets people lap dancing and doesn't pay for them.  He is a menace.  And that was just the beginning.  Yeah.  Because then at dinner, he was trying to order what?  We get to dinner.  And that's just, he is, we walk into the dining room and it just horrifies everybody else there. 
[01:40:30]  I understand it's Mardi Gras.  It's going to be loud and everything.  But Tom is one of those loud, embarrassing to be with, belligerent drunks.  And he's just ruining everyone else's night that's trying to just maybe get a couple of minutes away from the crowds on Bourbon Street to steal away with his girlfriend or something.  And there's Tom.  Let me tell you, I fuck her in the ass.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Tom, what?  Yeah.  This couple was sitting real close to us.  It was a whiz at the host of this place to sit them right next to our table. 
[01:41:00]  Ruined their evening.  The guy with the eye patch?  Yeah.  The guy with the eye patch comes in with his chick.  They sat him right next to us.  Dining room had plenty of open tables.  For some reason, they're right next to us.  They got to listen to Tom.  So we sit down.  We get the menus.  And Tom goes, the waiter comes over, Tom goes, all right, let's get one of every appetizer on the menu for the table.  Like the big man's going to order everything and we'll all pick at each other's and stuff, which I fucking hate.  I hate dealing like that.  You get your menu.  You order your appetizer, your main course, your dessert, whatever the frig you want. 
[01:41:30]  You order it yourself.  You eat it yourself.  If you want to share it with someone, fine.  And let's make it clear.  Tom knew and everyone else at the table knew that you were picking up the tab.  Because we talked about it on the air and stuff yesterday.  That was his first move.  I didn't let it go for two seconds.  The second he said it, I go, Tom, wait, wait, wait.  You paying for this?  He goes, no.  I go, good.  Then order your appetizer, your dinner, and everyone order theirs and deal with it that way.  Because you know what happens?  You get the big shot.  He's acting like a big shot that orders an appetizer, one of every appetizer for the table. 
[01:42:00]  It ends up a big pile of food that completely goes to waste.  Or there's something you want that Tom all of a sudden takes his filthy fork and shoves it in it.  And now I can't eat it because it went into his mouth, which is a whole other story unto itself.  Filthy moth, that horrible hole.  And I told him no.  So everyone, you know, orders individually.  That's the way it's done.  So the waiter, I guess, brought over Steve's appetizer and inadvertently put it in front of Tom. 
[01:42:30]  Tom takes that fork and digs it into the appetizer and starts eating it.  Steve goes, where's mine?  And Tom goes, oh, I think I got yours.  And goes to hand it back to Steve.  We all lose it.  Because who the hell is going to start eating out of that?  It's like eating a kibble out of the dog's bowl.  You know?  You're just not going to do it.  Yeah.  Awful, awful man.  He's digging it in, trying to pass it back.  And then Ben actually ate out of that.  Yeah, Ben was drunk enough to start eating out of Tom's plate, which all of a sudden made my girlfriend almost puke. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, she actually put her hand over her mouth and said, I can't look at him eating out of that.  That everybody was, you know, that you were eating out of his plate.  I'd rather eat ravioli after it was dumped in a septic tank.  How did you just dig in and munch?  First of all, he hardly touched it.  They weren't in the world.  Hardly.  They'd sample a lot of food.  The food is fine, but after it's put in his mouth?  It wasn't his mouth.  If a fork goes into half the side of the plate, it's not in.  Fork goes into his mouth.  Fork back in.  Scrapes teeth contaminated.  I'm with these guys.  I mean, his teeth are so awful, you just can't go there. 
[01:43:30]  These mushroom-laden gums and green teeth.  I got to ask, I mean, I have to ask, Jim, what did I do to you that you would give?  Well, wait, before even that, he dropped his phone into his soup.  Right, right, right, right.  He was fumbling with his phone the whole night, Tom.  Had it out.  I think he was calling Opie.  No, the phone rang.  Oh, that's right.  It was the Crazy Train ring, Ozzy's Crazy Train.  Yeah.  So he kept holding it up, going, look, Norton, I love you, Norton.  Look, Norton, and you hear Crazy Train playing because that's his ring.  And he's so drunk, he starts fumbling his phone, and it was slow motion. 
[01:44:00]  I saw him trying to catch it and gather it up, and it's just, it's bobbling off of each  of his fat little drunken fingers.  And it just plops face first the phone right into his creamy soup.  It was crawfish biscuits.  Crawfish biscuits.  His phone just goes splat, and he's like, oh, damn.  So then Norton decides to do one of his gags, and he gives Tom my cell phone number.  Well, Tom was asking for my number.  He's like, I want to call you, Norton.  So I'm like, all right. 
[01:44:30]  I want to test if my phone works, so let me get one of your numbers.  And I said, sure, of course, and I gave him Opie's cell number.  So he just continues to call Opie.  It was great.  Over and over again, he's leaving messages, even though he's like five feet away from  me.  Hey, Opie, how you doing?  How's your appetizer?  Could you imagine sitting with this idiot at dinner, people?  It was a nightmare.  You shouldn't have picked up your phone, by the way.  Someone gave him my cell phone number.  I'm like, go ahead, call.  That's my own cell phone.  My old cell phone.  It's not mine.  So he starts dialing it, and I feel it vibrating in my pocket. 
[01:45:00]  And he's looking at me, and I won't even acknowledge that I feel it.  I'm like, go ahead, call.  My phone was on the table, just bouncing around, because it was unvibrating.  It was pretty obvious that he nailed it.  So I'm like, you know what?  This is funny and all, but I've got to teach him a lesson, because I know what was going  to happen.  I know it's all good here at Mardi Gras, but we're going to get back to New York, and  I'm going to get drunken phone calls from Tom over and over again.  So I don't know how I got him to get me.  He handed the phone to me to mess around with it, and then I handed it to your brother, who 
[01:45:30]  then handed it to you.  Try to get the soup out of it.  Right.  And now we knew.  It was like, now, when I saw Opie with his phone, I'm just, I know Opie.  I've seen it before.  I'm like, oh, this is not good.  This does not bode well for Tom's phone.  So then I go to dial numbers, and I erase my number, right?  Right.  And then I just proceed to dangle it over my huge glass of water.  It was one of these big, huge mugs of water, like a tumbler.  And I went, oops.  Opie, don't you do it. 
[01:46:00]  And I went, oops.  Dropped it.  Right into the water.  Goes to the bottom of my tumbler of water.  And the whole table is like, oh.  That phone sank like a five-year-old at Tommy Lee's house.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  And did, uh, it was great because you could see it was lit up, and then as it hit the  bottom of the water glass, you just saw it go, like the lights on the Titanic before  it went under.  Yeah.  It just kind of blinked a couple of times.  It went dark. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, Opie, what?  Opie, give me my phone.  And then he's trying to get it to work the rest of the night, which it didn't, much to  Opie's glee.  Hell yeah.  I almost got him to give it back to me a second time because I was trying to, I was telling  him I used to work for a cell phone company and I know what to do to dry out your phone.  He was so close to giving it to me again.  And you guys thought I was going to just throw it back in the water.  At that point, I was just going to smash it right in front of him on the floor.  Smash it on the floor.  Oh, the guy just hung up, but someone from New Orleans was trying to get on the show. 
[01:47:00]  He said that Master Poe got a wow sticker on, you know, TV down here.  He did.  He got on the three, it was being taped for the three o'clock news.  We didn't know if he would get on, but he did run right in front of the camera.  Well, someone in New Orleans here saw it on local TV.  Poe was an animal down there.  He's an animal.  How many people were murdered overnight, Ant?  Did you watch the local news?  I didn't catch the murder report.  I got home and passed right out, man.  Yeah.  I was exausterated.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:47:30]  My name is Irock, and we're playing Mardi Gras 2005 in this segment here.  We're at the Crazy Horse Cabaret in New Orleans.  We're continuing to throw beads at people's drinks and at their faces when they're not looking  because we're bored and there's nothing really else to do.  So, Master Poe is down on Bourbon Street just dancing and annoying people, but this time  we turn on the wireless mic while he's down there making a jackass out of himself.  And for some of you old schoolers, this is the birth of O&A Party Rock.  It's one of those linger longer moments. 
[01:48:00]  And you're going to hear it right now.  Origin, if you will.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program, live from Mardi Gras.  We're out on the balcony at the Crazy Horse.  It is just a sea of people down there.  Ow!  Oh, jeez.  And it has begun.  It has begun.  Yes.  The pandemonium.  It's a lot more crowded today than it was yesterday. 
[01:48:30]  The sun is kind of poking through the clouds, so it's pretty humid and wet.  And you know what that means.  It's like soup down there in the streets.  It's people soup.  You've got the steam and the puke rising up from the street.  Yeah.  It's kind of, yeah, very humid up above.  Look at that hairy animal.  An animal.  A lot more people, though.  And I'm noticing, too, now don't call me out on this,  but a few more hotter chicks today than there was yesterday. 
[01:49:00]  A lot more hotter chicks.  Which makes them worthy of throwing some beads down.  That chick is wearing like a Steve C. flaming Mardi Gras hat, only it's purple.  Wonderful.  And she obviously knew someone was trying to knock the drink out of her hand.  Now I have some very heavy, clear-colored beads in my hand.  And I see an open drink below me.  It's a guy drinking out of a boot-shaped plastic glass.  Oh, you knocked that out of his hand.  I wish I had a rock.  There it goes.  That's a good one. 
[01:49:30]  Goodbye, fucker.  Did I hit him?  Dude.  He's looking up at me, and he wants to kill me, and I had nothing.  He bounced off his hand and swung and hit him right in the face.  And some beer came flying out of his cup and went all over his shirt.  Did I hit his stupid beer cup?  You weren't such a coward and ducked after you threw it.  Maybe you would know for yourself.  No, the trick is you can't stand there looking like the guilty party.  Why don't you just point and laugh?  What did Oswald do?  He got out of the book depository.  I'm not just going to stand here.  No, I understand that.  Didn't you see Jimmy having a Coca-Cola? 
[01:50:00]  He turned around and looked up and gave me the finger.  Wow, that was a good one.  That was a great shot, Jimmy.  I got another heavy one.  Here comes a chick with awful jersey hair sipping out of a...  She's walking away.  Yeah, she's getting out of range.  It's a weird thing here.  They've got to be in perfect position.  They kind of fly into your trap.  You know what I mean?  And if they kind of zig to the other side of the street, you get a little disappointed.  Because some of these people have these huge cups and they're a great target.  Anthony, you should try and knock out that cell phone right there. 
[01:50:30]  You know something?  We've left this little crowd in the middle alone.  They're guys that just decided in the middle of Bourbon Street,  they're plopping down with a cooler and ice and beers and they have open cups and everything  and they're just drinking in the middle of Bourbon Street.  You know why?  I just realized why.  They're fans of the show.  Yeah, and we've completely left them alone.  So they're watching us pelting other people.  They're kind of in the safe zone.  Before the first break started, there was three black guys walking by.  They worked for a catering and there was one catering.  They all had food wrapped up and I threw a big bomb trying to knock some catered food out of their hands. 
[01:51:00]  But it bounced off, unfortunately.  It really is the game to play if you're up on a balcony.  Dude, we are the dicks.  We are everything that's wrong with Mardi Gras.  They're all drinking and having fun and we're being just scumbags.  Look at the other balcony.  They are all hanging over and what they do is they hold a bunch of beads in one hand so people can see them.  They take them off one at a time and nice, gently throw them down at people.  We're hiding and throwing like a fastball down.  Okay, look at this one right here with the red glasses.  See her?  No, no, the chick, yeah, with the red glasses and the big cup. 
[01:51:30]  Okay, here we go.  Go ahead.  Goodbye, drink.  Fuck.  I missed her.  Oh.  And they're all.  There was like five shots we threw at it.  That girl's going to have a lump on the back of her head.  Her boyfriend got a little pissed off at that.  Too bad.  We are truly scumbags.  All right, you guys, really fast.  We got to go to Master Poe.  He's on the street.  Oh, Poe is on the street, of course.  Lost in two girls.  Let's see.  Let's see.  And does his mic work?  Nope, he's just yelling and no one can hear him.  He's yelling into nothingness. 
[01:52:00]  Of course he is.  All right, we can't hear him.  We can't hear him.  We'll try again in a minute or two.  We can't hear him.  Look at him.  He's still going.  He has no idea.  See the guy with the band hat on?  Where?  Hi, hi.  They're waving now.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, they're starting to throw the beads back.  I was going to throw a bunker buster.  Watch this.  Oh, right in the beer.  Perfect shot.  It landed.  Someone's wearing almost like a Mummer's Day Parade outfit, and someone threw it right  in her drink.  That is fantastic.  She was able to hold on to the drink, though. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, but she's wiping beer off her fat neck.  That's right.  Beat it, stupid.  Oh, I'm going to try to get rid of it.  See that guy right there?  Oh, perfect shot.  Some guy had a drink.  Ant just dropped a purple heavy bunker buster beads over the guy's wrist, and he got beer  all over himself.  And another guy that was able to hold on to his drink.  Wow, are we just the worst?  The women are more likely to drop their drink.  They seem to be able to hold on a little bit less.  Yeah, their fragile little wrists just give out under the pressure.  But the black guys never drop their drink.  No.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  And, of course, yesterday, Ope is aiming at people in wheelchairs.  Yeah, that was a little much.  Yeah.  I have another huge fistful of gold beads here.  See that fat woman right there?  Where?  She's double fisting right there.  Watch this.  I'll wait until the baby carriage goes by because I'm nice.  Yeah.  Oh, I hit the pump, and she held on to it.  She probably thought it was a chicken like the fat bitch.  Okay, here comes a guy with an open beer holding a chick's hand.  He's got beads on.  All right, who's going for it?  Oh, you hit him in the face.  Right.  I'm just looking at my brother.  I actually just look away like I didn't do nothing. 
[01:53:30]  Pilot to Bombardier.  Yeah, throw them cups.  Don't give away our beads.  There you go.  Look at this staggering drunk.  There's a staggering drunk eating a hot dog right there.  Where, where, where?  He's got a full beer right there.  I don't see him.  See him, Jimmy?  Right there, right there, Jimmy.  Oh!  Oh, yeah, I see him.  Your brother just threw it and missed.  All right, here's a guy right below us.  He has looking at Elvis glasses.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And a really bad, like, really thought.  He's looking up now.  All right, now he's not looking up.  I got to itch.  I just act like I was itching my head.  Nice shot right at the wrist.  Wrapped around his wrist, but didn't quite have enough energy to it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, there's nothing better than this.  People who are listening, you don't understand the beauty of just throwing things at people.  Are you going to throw these?  There are these, um, we call them Dago beads.  They're like, uh, they're red, white, and green, and they are so pointy and sharp, they  could actually do damage to somebody.  Yeah, but you can't curl them into a ball.  Oh, you can't?  You got to throw it like Oddjob throws his hat and hope it takes someone's head off like  a buzzsaw.  The weird thing is, none of these people have any idea that we're just beaming them with 
[01:54:30]  the beads.  No.  They all look up all happy, like, hey, yeah, give me some beads.  Yeah, I'll take some.  Thank you.  I have probably the biggest beads I've thrown yet.  Oh, my God.  This thing, these are really heavy.  I can't fit them all in one hand, and I am going to wait for the ideal situation.  It looks like Hands Across America if you did it with Down Syndrome children.  That's how large those beads are.  Okay, I have a big fistful of these beads.  I need somebody for target acquisition.  How about, that guy's holding an open-air cup, so we don't want to get him. 
[01:55:00]  There are some people that are very smart, and they have covered cups.  We don't go for that.  We don't go for the cans.  Right there.  Open beer.  He's pouring a giant Coors Light in a red shirt.  Oh, I see him.  He's a little far, though.  Yeah, look at him.  And now he's looking up.  Damn it.  Wave at him.  All right.  Wave stupidly.  Okay, see this guy right there?  Oh, someone just threw at him.  Yeah, he just missed him.  Yeah, I think Brett threw at him.  I'm waiting, and...  You've got to wait for the perfect opportunity.  He just put his head down.  This guy right here in front of us with the white T-shirt?  Yeah, should I do it?  Right there.  It is so crowded down here.  Oh, someone else threw again. 
[01:55:30]  All right, now they're looking up.  Now they're looking up annoyed.  No stupid work.  You want to come up, you dumb?  Oh, girls want to come up?  The two chicks want to come up.  So let them up.  You know what?  I've been telling people not to let people up.  The two chicks?  The guys I've been telling not to.  Maybe chicks, but...  Yeah, come on up.  No, Ben's saying no.  Ben's saying no for some reason.  Because guys come up here.  I've got to tell the fans also.  If you're down here at Mardi Gras, and you want to come up, it ain't going to happen  because other people ruin it for you.  They come up, and it would be cool if they just came and hung, but they don't shut up  about talking about the friggin' show two hours after the show's over. 
[01:56:00]  It's still blah, blah, blah.  We just go, shut up.  There's a guy with a king's hat.  He's wearing a king's crown.  What about this guy with the red cup?  I'm going for him.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, yeah, that's perfect.  I'm going for him, dude.  All right, you got the huge...  Oh, Bunker Buster.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where's the red cup?  I don't want the chicks to grab it, though.  No, no, those chicks...  Oh, baby carriage.  Watch out for the baby, Ben.  Oh, my God, Ben.  Ben is throwing it at infants.  I didn't need to throw.  I was trying to hit the guy's cup.  Why don't you throw a cone hanger down?  Here we go.  He just missed the baby and the baby died. 
[01:56:30]  Now he's looking up.  Oh, he looks like Tom, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Not really.  He's on two feet.  All right, Anthony.  There's a chick over there I'm going for.  Big tits.  Goodbye, drink.  Shit.  Oh, you hit a guy in the face.  Nice shot.  You got horrible aim, Jim.  No, I don't.  I very good at it.  You were doing much better before the show.  Jimmy makes it up in quantity.  He's like a Gatling gun.  He just keeps firing.  Of course, something's going to hit eventually.  I don't see any opportunity.  Okay.  What about, what about.  Oh, we already threw it, Fatty.  There's a chick over there with nice big cans wearing an awful black cowboy hat. 
[01:57:00]  And she has two pieces of like a boa coming off each end of that.  Is that girl topless right there?  Yes, she is, Anthony.  All right.  I'm going to knock the drink right out of that Fatso's hand.  There's a guy with his hand up.  He'll try to grab the beach.  I can't do it.  All right.  All right, go ahead.  Try to get Fatty with the feathers on her head.  No, I can't because she's looking up.  And there's too many people looking up now.  Yeah, they'll grab the beach.  Sometimes you get a perfect shot and someone grabs it right out of midair.  Ruins the whole thing. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, bullseye.  Oh, Jimmy.  Bullseye.  Jimmy just got a one-quart cup of Budweiser out of some guy's hands.  Oh, that poor son of a bitch.  And it was full.  Oh, you scumbag.  And all the Opie and Anthony fans down there are all cheering like crazy.  We have a group of about, I don't know, 30 or 40 fans just kind of hanging out, checking  out the show from below.  And as soon as Norton took out that beer, they went nuts.  Excellent shot, Jimmy.  They went nuts down there.  That guy's on to it.  Some guy was taunting. 
[01:58:00]  Someone hit his drink with beads and he was taunting like, I still have my drink.  Norton had the shot of the day.  So that was a great shot.  It really was amazing.  And you guys, we got to go to Master Poe again if he's paying attention.  Let's see if we can get to Poe.  Well, hit him in the head so he knows we're going to go to him.  That's your job.  Oh, you got him in the shoulder, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm good.  Master Poe, we're going to give you another shot.  Yeah, you're on, Master Poe.  Master Poe is down on the street of Bourbon Street.  He's the master MC.  And here he goes.  Let's see if this is going to work this time around.  He's trying to turn the microphone on. 
[01:58:30]  He's giving the mic a shot.  All right, everyone.  We're going to party today.  Hey.  We're broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse, Opie and Anthony Show.  Woo!  Give me one more.  Woo!  One more.  Woo!  All right, ready for some step?  Hell yeah.  Let's do some step.  And let's go.  All right.  Master Poe is just a dance step.  Yes, my darling.  You want a WOW sticker?  What is your name?  Essie.  Say O-N-A. 
[01:59:00]  Say O-N-A.  O-N-A.  What a crowd moment that it is.  Wow.  O-N-A show.  Oh, that's cool.  That's right.  That's Anthony.  That's Opie.  That's June.  Can you WOW them?  Wow.  That's a slide.  Let's go.  All right.  I've seen Charles Whitman work up at a crowd from a tower.  Come on.  Let's go.  All right.  All right.  I suppose just doing dance steps.  Turn off his stupid microphone.  Poe's dancing for radio.  Isn't that great?  The electric slide in the middle of New Orleans. 
[01:59:30]  And it's easy to slide on vomit.  He's just brilliant.  I wish he'd do the face planted to vomit.  Is that a dance move?  This is what Master Poe deserves.  Move out of my way.  Are you going to try to hit him again?  Go ahead.  Bean him.  He's closer now.  He's in the middle of the street.  He still thinks he's on the air.  He has no idea.  Oh, God.  What a heinous set of cans that woman just showed for beads. 
[02:00:00]  There are some atrocious women.  There really are.  All right.  All right.  See this fat slob in the pink?  Where?  Watch with my bunker buster.  I will attempt.  Oh, she just got hit in the head.  Oh, you hit her arm.  Anthony hit her arm.  And some drink flew out into a fat thing.  And, of course, fat slob wouldn't drop her beverage, so she held on to it.  But she got some on her piggy little wrist.  Oh, she's flipping up the birds.  She got so pissed off.  I've never seen anyone as pissed off as that lady just got.  You know what happened?  Three of us up here, I aimed for her.  She was like Steve defending a cub. 
[02:00:30]  By the way, they're on to us.  They're starting to throw the beads back pretty hard.  I know.  We're going to have to watch now.  There may be an all-out bead war soon.  Broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street on the balcony.  Hot chicks here at the strip club, by the way.  The costume's a big thing for Fat Tuesday, Opie.  So you're seeing a lot of people with bullheads.  There's a guy over there with a bullhead mask.  And a lot of guys dressed up like women.  Look at this guy.  He's wearing a skirt and leopard leg warmers. 
[02:01:00]  I noticed it's okay to be a fairy down here is what it is.  It's quite all right if you're a gay man and want to dress the part and just walk down the street.  Because that seems to be what a lot of people are doing.  And I've seen a lot of black gentlemen dressed as gladiators for some reason.  I don't know what's going on with that.  We've seen a few of those.  By the way, Master Pose still thinks he's on the air.  He has no idea.  I love it.  He's still talking into the microphone and dancing.  Yeah.  It's Master Pose Dance Fever.  I'm just putting my thumb up towards him.  I'm thumbsing him up.  So he keeps doing it. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, just trying to keep talking.  What a buffoon.  All right.  And we had to stop Tom from whizzing cups at people yesterday.  It's like, hey, how many guys have yellow Opie and Anthony hard plastic cups?  Yeah, just us.  I think they'll be on to us.  All right.  Oh, that's a nice target.  In the corners where the gutters are in the street, it is just littered with filth.  It looks like somebody just took a garbage truck and emptied it along the street.  It is literally that dirty.  We noticed this morning they didn't even bother cleaning up the streets at all. 
[02:02:00]  They just said, eh.  One more night.  You know what I'm amazed at here is the amount of backing of the WOW stickers.  Now, you can't see all the stickers because people take them, put them on themselves, on other things.  But you can see all the white paper from the back of the stickers, and it's littering the street.  And plastic cups.  If people drop their plastic cups and it goes into the gunky gutter water, they just kind of leave it there because you can't touch it after it's been in that filthy water.  How stupid is Master Pose?  He still thinks he's on the air.  He's working the crowd.  Has no idea that we gave up on him ten minutes ago. 
[02:02:30]  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  O and A party rock.  O and A party rock.  Party rock?  What?  I don't know.  Keep his mic on for a second.  Nice phonics.  Yeah.  Okay.  Red drink.  Striped shirt.  Someone just went for it.  Damn it.  Missed her.  Wow.  Oh, she's pissed.  Who cares?  Damn it.  I was going.  You know, I'm at the end of the line here.  I don't get to throw at anybody walking this way.  What's up, baby?  I'm rock.  Oh, oh, pilot's a bombardier.  The guy's got a...  Yeah, tell him.  Oh, there they are.  Wow.  You guys rock. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, thank you.  Like the holy grail.  I suppose Mike is working again.  Oh, great.  That's cool.  All right, let's turn him off again.  Let's turn him off again.  He's talking like...  Oh, someone just got a great shot on a guy's beer right there.  I think it was your brother again.  Your brother's a crack shot there.  Yeah, I've noticed he's doing quite well with the beat thing.  Who are these freaks on the balcony?  That's not Tom, is it?  Oh, all right.  I thought Tom was back.  No, it's the same guy walking around yesterday with the inappropriate bell.  Why is he up here?  I don't know.  How did he get up here?  I don't know. 
[02:03:30]  Ben's like, no, you can't let the hot chicks up here.  But we got the guy ringing the goddamn inappropriate bell.  I didn't let him up here.  I was told due to fire laws.  That's what he'd love.  Due to fire laws, yeah.  Yeah, look at every other balcony.  I know, but that's what I was told.  If you let someone up here, you'll fire.  Pretty much the fire law.  What I noticed this morning, they were reinforcing all these balconies.  With what?  Just like two-by-fours.  Oh, really?  Scaffolding.  Oh, they prop it up with like lolly columns or something.  Wow, that would be fun to watch one of these fall, huh?  Yes. 
[02:04:00]  I'm sure it has happened in the past.  Still to come on the show, Anthony, I don't even know.  It's going to get worse.  We're going to talk to Lou Ferrigno.  How is that possible?  I thought Lou was deaf.  I thought he was deaf.  Plus the fact that it's louder than I've ever heard in my life.  What is Lou Ferrigno plugging?  Anything?  I don't know.  He's on what, Ben?  He's like the King of Queens.  Oh, he's on the King of Queens.  We're going to talk to Lou Ferrigno at 4 o'clock.  Oh, he's coming in?  No, he's just going to be on the phone?  On the phone.  That's going to just be awful.  How are we doing a phoner with Lou Ferrigno? 
[02:04:30]  Wow, we looked that up.  That was a good move.  Yeah, that's brilliant.  That's got to be our brilliant booker.  Let's be in the loudest place we could possibly be in, talking to a deaf guy.  Yeah, on the phone.  That's fantastic.  And also, a little later, we're going to be having lap dances live on the show, right?  What?  Yeah, Norton's going to get a lap dance live on the show from one of the girls here.  It's crazy.  My mule right now is probably a quarter inch because I finished myself off in one of the strip clubs  last night for $2.50, and then I scrapped to myself when I got back to the room. 
[02:05:00]  I was disgusting.  You are the horniest human being on the face of the earth.  I was a disgrace yesterday.  There were some hot dancers here last night.  Did you hear what he said, though?  What?  He finished himself off at a strip club.  What do you mean?  What happened?  I went to a strip club.  I don't even remember the name.  I just wandered in because it was a chick out front, and I happened to look at one of  the girls dancing, and I noticed that she had a nice...  Two beers, one hand.  Oh, go, go, go.  Two beers, one hand.  Damn it.  I hit it, but it didn't fall out, and I noticed that she had a very lovely camel toe, so I paid 
[02:05:30]  for a lap dance, and she said she would show me it for an extra $40, and then for the next  dance...  Wait, wait.  For $40 more, you're going to get to see it.  It's actually bare nude.  All right.  And then one more dance I gave her money for, and she said for $150, I can whack my...  I said, I'm going to whack myself off, and she goes, well, that's $100, and I'll do you  for $150, and I'm like, well, how much if I just go down on you?  Wait, so then you decide you're going to go down on her and take care of yourself.  Yeah.  Wait, she would have done you...  With her hand.  With her hand for a price.  So for $150, plus the dance, she stands over me on the couch in a private area, and she's 
[02:06:00]  just rubbing on my mouth, and I'm going...  And I just finished myself, all of my fat stomach and appendix scar.  It was disgraceful.  Oh, God, is that disgusting.  It was disgraceful.  And the whole thing costed $250?  Yeah, but it removed the obsession, because I would have wound up going out with Dunk  Toms and another strip club.  Why wouldn't you...  I think I would have opted more for the one...  How much was it for her to do it?  $150 or $150?  Yeah, why wouldn't you go $150 and have her do it?  You ever have a girl try to do that?  They're horrendous at it.  They yank out pubes.  It's awful.  I would have wound up getting annoyed. 
[02:06:30]  The song would have ended, and she would have been like, well, I have to start over.  That's more money for the next song.  It's not like you're getting it from a virgin high school girl.  She's a pro.  I had to take care of it myself, because I wanted to see what she had.  I wanted to, you know, I wanted to...  All right, yeah, you're like, let's make a deal up there.  Yeah, absolutely.  I figured you'd go for the box.  Yeah.  And that would all make sense, because you ended up hanging with us last night, because  you got rid of the obsession.  Yes.  You seemed very relaxed when we were hanging on the SoCo balcony last night.  I could have had curtain number one, or I could have had chlamydia behind panties number  two.  I chose chlamydia.  I think you made the right choice. 
[02:07:00]  Why not?  We need some more beads down at this end of the...  More beads, please, for the two stars.  We need more beads down here.  I have a nice bomber right here.  Oh, wow.  Here's the deal, you guys.  All right, all right.  I got to find somebody.  All right, as you're looking for a person to take out with your beads, we're going to take  a break.  All right.  Of course, Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street.  We got some ladies that want to meet Jim, so we'll go back inside so we can have Jim  get a lap dance.  How's that sound, all right?  Very nice.  Nice.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening. 
[02:07:30]  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's Sirius XM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  We're playing back the live shows from Mardi Gras 2005, combining two days into one gigantic  mess.  And in this segment here, we're live from the Crazy Horse in New Orleans.  Crazy Horse doesn't exist anymore.  I think it's called the Penthouse Club now, so if you're going down there, you can't find  the place.  Go to the Penthouse Club.  I'm sure it's nice.  In this segment here, we got some strippers doing a lap dance for Jim. 
[02:08:00]  Here's another linger longer moment for you.  One of the old hangers on, if you will.  Lady Di calls into the show.  One of the whores does a fake orgasm, and with nothing else to do, we continue to throw  beads at people on the street.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  They're starting to throw them back, Anthony.  Yeah, now I'm just throwing them in people's heads.  Here we go.  Whoa.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street. 
[02:08:30]  Actually, we're in the balcony of the Crazy Horse.  Of course, we went into today's program realizing that it's just going to be another cluster  F, so we're just going to have fun with this.  And they're setting up, I guess, the inside portion of the balcony for the lap dance that  Jimmy's going to get in a few minutes here from the sister club of the Crazy Horse.  But in the meantime, it's starting to get a little uglier out here.  The sun is popping back out, by the way.  The rain shower is done.  We're throwing cups gingerly, and we're beaming people with the beads as well. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  But they're starting to throw the beads back.  They are throwing back.  And they're not doing a good job, by the way.  No, no.  Here comes the galley.  Watch out.  Come on.  Come on.  Nice job, buddy.  Yeah, they're starting to throw the beads back at us, which is exactly what we were hoping  would happen, so.  Come on.  Now it's an all-out bead war.  It's going to get really dangerous.  It really is going to get ugly.  All right.  There you go. 
[02:09:30]  Anyway.  Watch out for flying debris.  Is that guy dressed as Evil Knievel?  I believe so, yes.  Without the evil part.  Yeah.  Faggot Knievel.  Faggot.  Yeah.  You notice that?  A lot of these people have these macho costumes, but there's nothing macho about faggots.  Right.  I got two words.  Faggot.  I see two.  Three.  Three Elvis down there.  Uh-oh.  That guy could cause a problem.  That guy is not happy.  He just took a header with a bunch of beads. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy?  What?  Hi.  How are you, buddy?  Good.  I can't hear anything you're saying because I don't have my...  Basically what's happening out here.  Yeah.  Jimmy was inside because we were getting ready for the lap dance.  They're starting to throw the beads back at us.  I just smashed some guy in the head with a nice pair of five-pounders.  That was you who took out that guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not happy.  He's not happy at all.  Okay.  I can hear now.  How are the girls inside?  Are they hot?  Really hot.  I only looked at them for a second because I ran a tinkle, but they look very, very attractive. 
[02:10:30]  You want to be all prepared for your lap dance.  You don't want any bladder pressure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  Unfortunately, I'm packing a half, but I really wish I'd have known this was happening.  I would have restrained myself twice last night.  Well, like that matters to Jimmy.  But for me, it would have, you know, just a nice firm wrap three times.  And once again, the music is starting to get louder across the way.  Yeah.  I see a giant pepper walking down the street for some ridiculous reason.  And it looks like the giant pepper has fallen a few times.  You see that?  Yeah.  It's full of mud and gutter sleeves. 
[02:11:00]  That just missed you, Jimmy.  I know.  He was trying for Jimmy.  He was definitely gunning for Norton.  And these guys are definitely getting more aggressive.  Oh, come on.  Let's see what you got.  He's winding up.  He's winding up.  And nice toss, actually.  Wow.  Oh, this could do some damage.  I just noticed.  I don't want to let them on to this.  But if one person throws as a distraction, another person can throw and wail us really good.  Because we're distracted looking at the one set of beads.  Yeah.  So we've got to really be careful.  We've got to watch each other's backs. 
[02:11:30]  Yep.  Overlapping field of fire.  All right.  Let's save these.  This is going to be a nice weapon later.  This is like the sniper scene from Full Metal Jacket.  The naked lady beads.  We'll place them right there for later.  Those are good.  Yeah.  That'll really hurt.  Yeah.  Look for a baby carriage.  Throwing it at infants.  Wonderful.  All right.  Why don't we go back inside and get the lap dance done for Jimmy?  All right.  Oh, wait.  Look.  Titties.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Never mind.  They weren't that good?  Oh, they were awful.  Gravy stains.  It looked like they could have been pretty good. 
[02:12:00]  Watch out, Jimmy.  Oh, that's why I said, look, because she looked like she wouldn't have been that bad, but they  were really awful.  All right.  We're going back inside.  Jimmy's making his way inside.  We've got two girls that are going to give Jimmy a very nice lap dance live on the program.  Steve, are you tape?  Steve's going to tape the lap dance for FoundryMusic.com and OpieAndAnthony.com.  I noticed this occasion is really for a lot of older women that, like, once a year can  come out and show their boobs because no one asks them to all year long.  Right.  So this is like they're coming out.  And the other thing, you know, most of the boobs, I'd have to say 95% of the boobs from 
[02:12:30]  a balcony look really good.  Oh, really?  Well, because you're looking down on them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You can't see that gravity's taking its toll and stuff from above.  For some reason.  That's true.  Except that you have noticed the two to three foot cleavage from time to time.  Big, long, nasty cleavage.  Look at this.  From behind, these girls in the Catholic schoolgirl outfits look like they could be really hot,  right?  Yep.  They turn around.  They're like middle-aged women.  Look at this lady.  She's got to be 55 years old. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, here you go.  And then look at the guy that she's with.  He's dressed as a teacher.  He's got a ruler in his pocket and a pocket protector.  That was really creepy.  All right.  I hear Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're all set in there?  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm sitting here right by the couch and just really waiting for my lap dance very eagerly.  Okay.  We're going to make our way back in.  Jimmy, just start babbling.  We'll be in there in a second.  Well, the chicks are here.  I haven't met them, but I've kind of seen them, and they are really attractive.  Yeah, I'm going to have to snag a look at them. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, really hot.  They're wearing civilian clothes, though, so I'm hoping they put on something like maybe  panties or something a bit more revealing.  Well, their regular clothes have to come off, I believe.  Yeah, I would hope so.  I'm going to come running in there.  All right, Ant.  We'll hold the force.  All right.  I'm all set.  I'm in perfect position to check out this lap dance.  Mardi Gras really is a chance for fat, ugly pigs to feel like attractive girls.  They now know what it feels like to be bogled and to be wanted, and it's really like a  place for awful people.  Yeah, they have no problem showing their boobs, their pussy at times. 
[02:14:00]  They're all for it, the middle-aged women.  You notice that, Anthony?  Oh, they love it.  That's what I was saying.  It's like this is their one time a year to come out.  Why is this wet?  Ew.  Why is the couch wet?  Is it wet?  Ah, water was...  Feel it.  Is it wet or no?  Just sit down.  No, it's not wet.  Oh, okay.  What is the matter with you?  I don't know.  I thought it was wet.  You're absolutely insane.  I really am a weirdo.  This is the driest couch ever.  Oh, I am.  Maybe it was, you know, used or something.  Three men just sitting on a couch talking.  Ah.  All right.  Ben's picking up a microphone. 
[02:14:30]  So, Ben, what's going on here?  We have some ladies that are going to be at the Gold Club.  It starts tomorrow night.  It's the G-String Awards.  Of course it is.  It's a four-day event, right?  At the Gold Club Cabaret.  Yeah.  The Gold Club's great.  We went there the other night.  This place Steve fell asleep.  Great club.  The sister club of this place.  It's a rousing endorsement.  No, no, no.  Steve was there.  He fell asleep.  But we all understand Steve.  After about 500 drinks.  But no.  So, Steve and I, we've got a couple girls here.  They want to dance for Jim.  Welcome, Jim, to New Orleans.  Oh, that's very nice.  Do we have any music for the girls? 
[02:15:00]  Because most of these girls need the music to do their lap dances, too.  Yeah.  Something we didn't think of.  Yeah.  Well, I can play some music and put some headphones on them.  That's going to be awkward.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  No.  Maybe very low.  We can play music from back there.  The girls can just dance.  There's music outside.  They can hear.  The music's bleeding in.  You know what?  They're pros.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  They'll figure it out.  If they can hide their revulsion from my fat stomach, they can certainly pretend there's music playing.  Let's bring the girls in.  They're not going to be able to hear us because it's so loud. 
[02:15:30]  We've got to say that again, Anthony.  We all have headphones on.  That's the only way we're able to communicate with each other.  Put my sunglasses over there, sweet angel, if you don't mind.  All right.  Bring in the girls.  Here they come into our little cubicle area.  Disgusting.  Oh, hi.  Hello.  Too beautiful.  You lovely girls.  She's looking at Michael.  She's never seen one before.  I know.  This is going to be interesting.  Jesus.  You talk into it.  Words transfer to someplace else.  Oh, boy.  Oh, hi.  Hi, I'm Chloe Love. 
[02:16:00]  Chloe?  You're Chloe?  Wait, hold on.  That's Jimmy.  I'm Jim.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  She's very lovely.  This is Reagan Anthony.  Hi, I'm Reagan.  Hi, Reagan.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you?  We brought you presents.  You brought us presents?  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Oh, no.  That's great.  Are these?  Of course, since we're getting one of your guys' stickers, you have to get ours.  You get the Chloe Loves Me.  Your guys' is.  And you also get exotic dancing is not a crime. 
[02:16:30]  That's true.  But choking her for teasing you after it is.  They can't hear.  They can't hear.  Thank you, sweetheart.  That's the best.  Are either of you in any of these features?  I am, yeah.  You are.  Which one?  Both?  Both.  That's me on the cover.  This is hardcore?  This is you.  This is hardcore?  It's hardcore, but lots of teasing.  I'll get your dick hard.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll see what you can do live.  If you guys are sticking around, I'll bring you my porn.  It's very hardcore.  Yeah, she's got a hardcore porn.  Oh, hardcore.  Oh, what kind of porn did you do?  I mean, what kind? 
[02:17:00]  What kind of porn?  Yeah.  I do girls and guys.  I'm a hardcore porn person.  Oh, do you have any with you?  I've done about 10 so far.  Who have you shot with?  What companies?  BCA.  Okay.  Actually, Mike South.  He works for Hollywood Video and one with Wicked.  And what are you known for in your pornos?  Anything?  Anything special?  What's your specialty?  Yes, my oral skills.  Your oral skills.  Oh.  What makes your oral skills better than most?  You know what?  I don't know, but everybody says I have a little tongue trick that I do.  Yeah?  Oh.  How about that?  Very nice.  I'm in conjunction with Playboy. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, cool.  I work with Playboy.  So yours are not really hardcore, but hers is vivid and wicked.  They won't let me do hardcore right now because of all the Playboy stuff I've been doing.  Understandable.  Wow.  Are you guys coming to the G-Strings?  The G-String, what is it called again?  The G-String Awards.  Awards?  What is the G-String Awards?  That's me.  You're looking at me.  You're beautiful.  That's me.  I won it last year.  I mean, you're beautiful in person, too.  What is it, though?  What's the competition?  Just dancing?  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  What is the G-String Awards all about? 
[02:18:00]  Is it...  It's...  It's...  Now it's become, you know, one of the best competitions in the industry.  It's the best of the best of the best are only invited.  It's four categories.  It's porn, showgirl, magazine, and...  Is it three or four categories?  It's three.  It's porn, showgirl, and magazine.  Oh, mackerel.  I'll say.  Yeah.  So, um, it, um, it, like the elite of the elite come to our contest and... 
[02:18:30]  And show off their wares.  And show off their wares.  This is not the first year, is it?  No, no.  This is the fifth year.  Because my buddy went to it one time, and I'm like, dude, how hot are the chicks?  And he said, you wouldn't believe.  Yeah, we're pretty hot.  Hold on.  Move your arms so I can see her breasts.  Oh.  Wow, wait.  Wow, lovely.  Wow, very nice.  Are you guys coming?  Yeah, now I'm coming.  Absolutely.  About 30 seconds.  That's wonderful.  Can I watch?  You girls want to dance for Jimmy?  Well, we had planned on it. 
[02:19:00]  That would be very lovely.  We have some music ready if you want it.  All right.  Let me step...  I'll step over here.  Where are you going, sweetie?  Well, I want to give Jimmy room.  Yeah, we...  All right.  We're true friends, Jimmy.  I'm going to take this off now, because we're going to take our towels off.  We're going to give you the whole couch here.  Hold on a minute.  We're getting off the couch.  You girls just go nuts, all right?  Anthony and I will try to describe what's going on.  Can you guys do this without music, though?  Well, there's music on it.  All right.  You can hear the music?  Yeah, they can.  Should I leave my headphones on?  All right.  Anthony, two really hot blondes.  They've got the wife beater t-shirts on and jeans and little sneakers.  They're coming off.  I know they're coming off. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah, they go.  And the wife beaters are coming off, Anthony.  The one girl is topless.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  She's got a lovely breasted foot.  Oh, there we go.  Really lovely girl.  All right.  They're both topless at this point.  What's that, ma'am?  Spread the legs.  Get comfortable.  Do you know the drill?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Can we?  I don't want to unplug this.  I'll be an on-the-field reporter here.  Holy Toledo.  All right.  Can I take these stupid headphones off?  Here, Adam.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I'll mic you.  I got the wireless mic, Jimmy, if we need you.  There we go. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Slouch.  We've got to be able to get to your toys.  Oh, see?  He's slouching in the couch, so he's a...  All right.  You ready?  He's very relaxed.  Oh, wow.  Now, one of the girls now pushing her breast into Jimmy's face.  Jimmy's whole head is disappearing in between cleavage.  You know what I noticed?  Jimmy's not really breathing, though.  He's just kind of like holding his breath as the boobs are just being rubbed up and around  his nose and his eyes.  He's going for a kiss.  He's sneaking, stealing a kiss on the girl's shoulder. 
[02:20:30]  Now, the other girl's straddling Jimmy.  Yeah, dry hump in Jimmy's crotch area with her ass.  Huh?  He's got a chubby.  He does have a chubby?  Because he was complaining that it was...  Don't talk about his gut.  He's trying to enjoy himself.  He was complaining that he didn't think...  I don't think it's his gut.  You feel it, right?  Yeah, it's a chubby.  Yeah, because he whacked off three times last night.  He didn't think he could get a chubby for you, girls.  Can you go three times with a girl?  Probably, yeah.  I mean, but last night I was just so lonely and annoyed at myself.  I had to just scrap on my computer three times.  You're coming home with me, then. 
[02:21:00]  Nice.  You can hardly feel it.  It's nothing there, really.  How come you're both wearing jeans?  Don't worry about it.  That'll change in a minute.  Switch positions.  Does he have a chubby?  He does, actually.  I can feel it in there.  Is it a good chubby, or what?  Yeah, it's good enough for anal.  Hey, there's something you don't hear every day.  How about that?  It's good enough for anal.  Jimmy, let me try to get a mic in there.  Well, she gave it a good description.  It's good enough for anal.  That's actually a bumper sticker I'll be selling at my shows. 
[02:21:30]  Are you ready for a butt view?  Yeah, I have a butt view.  It would be fantastic.  Oh, I'd love that.  They're taking a slight break so they can get their jeans off.  Jimmy, what do you think so far?  They're two of the hottest chicks I've ever seen.  They're fantastic.  Two really hot blondes.  They're showing the brown eye right now.  Can I see it?  I promise you.  I'm sure it's nice.  Why do you hate it?  I don't like it.  Why?  Because it's not round enough.  What do you say?  It's not hardcore porn.  You've been naked before.  Guys, I'm not going to be rude.  Yeah, Jimmy's negotiating, but the one girl doesn't want to take her jeans off, Anthony.  I have a feeling it might be... 
[02:22:00]  Oh, do you think it's time to lie?  Yeah, I think she's just coming up with an excuse.  Anytime there's a girl or two in there, one of them has to go.  Hey, what are you doing to that other girl there?  What are you doing to that other girl there?  What do you have to describe for the radio?  I'm being naughty.  She's being naughty, Anthony.  She's rubbing her jeans.  Well, she just went south.  Jimmy, you have a very good viewpoint there.  What's going on?  Well, the one girl is doing exactly what I'd like to be doing to the other girl.  Yeah.  She's really sexy.  I really enjoy this.  Do you enjoy that?  I do. 
[02:22:30]  I love having oil done.  Oh, that seemed to be a little ticklish, Anthony.  A little tickle.  Okay, are the jeans coming off now, or is that more of a tease thing today?  Oh, very sexy.  All right.  Yeah, I won't take them off.  All right, there you go.  Jimmy, what do you think?  There's the butt.  She has...  Oh, does she have a great...  Oh, she's sexy.  Just say it.  Her lips are so sexy, yeah.  You just saw the lips from behind?  Is it not?  Yours aren't pierced?  Thank you.  Pierced?  Look, I'll show you a piercing. 
[02:23:00]  Jimmy, she wants to show you her piercing.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look at...  Can you pull them down?  I won't touch.  I just want to see.  I haven't shaved.  I don't care.  I don't care if you've washed, showered.  Oh, my God.  They haven't shaved today, Anthony.  Wow.  How hot is that?  What do you think?  One is shaved, one is not.  That's amazing.  So, so attractive.  This is really, really frustrating.  That's wonderful.  Very sexy girls.  Lady, see if his chubby's doing a little better.  Is his chubby still...  Yeah, his chubby's still there. 
[02:23:30]  Is he getting better, or...  Huh?  Is his chubby getting better?  We could do more with him, but we'd have to take him home.  What?  They want to take you home.  I would like that a lot.  Don't tease, because he'll leave the broadcast.  I will walk off this dumb radio show in 30 seconds.  He will leave right now.  I'll take my own flight back.  I'll fly US Air, and I'll sit on the wing.  You know, we got our car here.  You just go back with us.  You have your car?  Yeah, I'm driving.  I would actually let Tom...  I would sit on Tom's lap on a motorcycle right now to go home with these two, and I'd put 
[02:24:00]  my nose in his mouth so we could breathe through it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Very nice.  All right.  Jimmy, grab that microphone.  Very nice.  That was a nice lap dance, huh?  Yes.  Chloe and Reagan.  Chloe and Reagan from...  What films can people see you in?  What films can people see you in?  Angels of the South, Melted Pink, and Blowjob Girls 2.  Blowjob Girls 2.  I love the title.  Melted Pink, Anthony.  That's great. 
[02:24:30]  What's the plot of Melted Pink?  Don't know.  No?  She doesn't know.  Don't know.  Just come in, do your part.  Yeah, exactly.  Let them cut it.  All right.  Very nice.  Okay.  Really nice girl.  Let's hear it for the girls.  Really hot.  Very sexy.  Absolutely beautiful.  You wanted to go back outside and throw some beads, Anthony?  Sure.  Yeah, we'll do a little more of that, I guess.  Oh, I'm going to love, dude.  Hold on.  We got a very important caller on the phone here that wants to say hi.  Let's go to this here and say hi to who? 
[02:25:00]  You know I'm a buzzkill.  You know that, right?  Oh, I know.  Just, you know how hot...  Who's a buzzkill?  Oh, God damn it.  We just had a hot girl on our palate, and you're washing it off with this dog crap.  I am.  I'm just asking, you know, how you join the Mardi Gras, that's all.  How do you join the Mardi Gras?  Yeah, how?  Lady Di, you would fit in perfect down here.  Yep.  It's the land of the raging alcoholics.  You would lead the parade down here.  Oh, she could be the float.  If I ever went to New Orleans, I would definitely go over there. 
[02:25:30]  And you wouldn't come back alive.  Well, I don't know about that.  Every day is a Mardi Gras for you.  You're drunk.  No.  So, do you get a job?  You got a job yet?  Actually, I'm going right now.  I'm going to classes to get a job.  Classes to get a job.  Here's the new thing.  What classes are you taking to get a job?  Well, you know, what happens is I have to go over to a place, and I have to be there at 9 o'clock, and we have to be there until about at least 11, 30, 12 o'clock.  And they're giving us classes on, you know, how to get a job and everything like that, you know, whatever, whatever. 
[02:26:00]  What type of job are they giving you classes to get?  Well, whatever's available for me.  So, instead of filling out applications and interviewing at places, you're going to a class?  No, no, no, no, they give you the places to put in an application.  And where is this school?  It's New Jersey.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  All right, yeah, you know, the listeners are calling like crazy, and they're saying, please get rid of the cooler.  Oh, what?  They're saying that we're having a really good show and to just get rid of the cooler, so let's get rid of Lady Di. 
[02:26:30]  Thanks, Lady Di, for adding nothing to the show once again.  What a complete disaster she is.  All right, we've got to get back out on the balcony so we can throw some more beats.  We've got Lou Ferrigno.  He's checking into the program in about 15 or 20 minutes.  Ooh.  Can one of you girls do, like, a fake orgasm as we get our microphones back out outside on the balcony?  Would you mind doing that, Chloe?  All right, give Chloe the wireless mic, and as we situate ourselves back out on the balcony,  she's going to do a really good fake orgasm, right? 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Now, you know what we want.  We kind of want the slow build into a dough, and then, you know, finish up.  I can do that.  Great.  Let's see the acting ability, and we need it to be long enough so we can get out on the balcony.  Okay.  All right, let her rock.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  There we go.  Do it, Jimmy.  Ew.  That's the spot.  I don't want to hear Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't think it's that good.  Oh, yeah.  She's a lot more than what she sounds.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh.  All right.  We're back on the balcony of the crazy horse.  Yeah.  Who's the Paris Hilton-looking girl that just... 
[02:28:30]  Where's that?  ...that just came up here on the balcony.  Looks just like Paris Hilton, no?  They're saying, yes, yes, yes.  Your brother's hysterical, Opie.  Huh?  Brett hit a girl's beer.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and knocked it completely out of her hand, got beer all over her.  And she looked so sad, and I think she was a fan of the show, that Brett then threw her  down five bucks to buy her new beer.  No kidding, really?  Yeah, he's a softie.  My brother is the softie in my family, by the way.  He's a softie.  Thank you, baby.  All right.  Yeah, we're getting reloaded. 
[02:29:00]  Our beads are getting reloaded here.  We got more of these Opie and Anthony beer mugs we're tossing down there.  They're a hit.  They're a hit to the people down on Bourbon Street, Anthony.  Yes, they are.  Okay.  Speaking of hitting people on Bourbon Street, I have a new supply of beads and a whole new  crew walking by with their exposed drinks.  I need a...  Why haven't I gotten another Bloody Mary?  Well, I don't know.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Club Soda Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny's too busy watching another girl dance. 
[02:29:30]  Kenny!  There's like three or four other girls out here on the balcony just kind of doing like  dances now.  Club Soda Kenny.  Give that to Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny.  No, give him the headphones.  Give Kenny the headphones.  Kenny.  Kenny, perhaps instead of watching Paris Hilton over there, whatever her name is, perhaps you  could look and be a little more attentive to the boys' needs?  No, she's trying to weasel her way over here.  Oh, she is?  Yeah.  Oh, is that what she was doing?  Yeah.  Who is she?  Yeah.  So you're keeping attractive girls away from us? 
[02:30:00]  By looking at their asses?  Believe me, she's nothing to look at.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't have a good view from here.  Well, well...  I've had a better look.  She kind of looks like Paris Hilton on Crack.  Crack.  On Crack?  Yeah, with the scabs.  Is that a good thing?  You know, that's why they keep the lights down low in these strip clubs.  I understand.  Now, thank you, Kenny, for protecting us.  Yeah, the lights are turned down to cover up a world of hurt, so...  Kenny, is there anyone that could get me a Bloody Mary? 
[02:30:30]  Whatever you would like, it would be my pleasure.  Thank you, sir.  Bloody Mary, Mr. O, anything?  We haven't had a joke from Kenny either all day.  Yeah, you got today's joke?  You got a joke?  I'll tell you, I'm absolutely frazzled.  You don't know how many fans are trying to crash this party.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is working hard.  A lot of people trying to come up, and he's keeping them away.  Yeah, they're just trying to crash the party, and I got my hands full with that.  I noticed something.  Kenny's working really hard to protect us, right?  And Master Poe is working very hard to pick up our listeners, so... 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, Master Poe's probably the one inviting people up that Kenny then has to throw out.  Who, Master Denny Terrio?  Denny Terrio.  He's doing...  The Hispanic Denny Terrio.  He's doing dance fever on the street.  He's doing splits in the middle of Bourbon Street, right into the slime and puke.  He's got slimy crotch from doing his splits.  By the way, I think we really did lose Jim Norton for the day.  Oh, he doesn't care about the show anymore.  He's now wrapped around two girls.  Just to come over here, I almost slipped in his puddle of clear stuff. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, that's jimmies.  Yeah.  You could skate on it like Hans Christian Anderson.  It's amazing.  All right, here.  I'm going to get your Bloody Mary now.  Think up a joke on your way back up.  I hear you.  No, no.  You got a joke.  Give us a joke.  You got one right now?  I was taking the pressure off him and saying, you know, he could think it over on his way.  I got to think.  When I come back, I promise you.  I come back with Anthony's drink and have a joke.  All right.  Meanwhile, Jimmy is completely taken with a scabby Paris Hilton. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  Jimmy has just given up on the show.  He's like, screw this.  He came back.  He almost put the headphones on.  He saw another girl and ran away.  And he just left us.  Here he comes.  Hey, Jimmy.  He's coming back.  Watch.  He's going to say that she's really hot, and we already decide that she's not hot.  Watch now.  Watch this.  Watch this.  What's up, Jim?  What's up, Jim?  I really want one from that girl.  She's sexy.  Which one?  This one right here with the blonde hair.  The one that looks like Paris Hilton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We thought we were going to see her.  I want a lap dance from that one.  Anthony and I were saying we thought she's the hottest girl here. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, Kenny.  I really want a lap dance right there.  I'll do it.  I'll pay her for it in the air.  Of course you will.  I think that's what she does.  What do you like about her?  She's got a great body.  Very skinny.  And, yeah, and she has, like, her panties look like really, like, they hug her very nicely.  Oh, you like that?  Yeah.  Like, her midsection is very, like, there's zero body fat.  Yeah, we definitely want her.  She's got the body of a crack whore.  You don't mind the scabs and stuff on her arms?  No, please.  If she doesn't have them now, she will when she's done with me.  Yeah, we definitely. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  She's so stupid.  I definitely want that one right there, though.  She's, uh...  That's not like Paris Hilton.  She's more like Newark Hilton.  She's showing her rump to the people down on Bourbon Street.  Does she have panties on?  I don't know.  Lift that up for a second.  Lift it up.  We can't see.  Does she have panties on?  Lift up the little tiny skirt.  Lift up the back of your skirt.  And...  Oh!  Wow, there's a lot of hurt there, Anthony.  I want to dance from her.  There's a lot of pimples.  Wow, it looks like she's scared.  I shot with a BB gun a few times in the ass. 
[02:33:30]  I don't care.  I definitely like her.  I think she ran out of veins to shoot up in.  She's shooting directly into her butt cheeks.  Something's going on there.  Well, I mean, it is just getting completely out of hand on Bourbon Street now, man.  Completely out of hand.  Yeah, very wet.  Very disgusting.  Look at the gutters now.  They're ten times filthier than when we got...  Ah!  Guy just got hit in the head with beer.  Yeah, but that's one of our listeners.  He's already on to us, so...  He's having fun.  You notice another observation here, Anthony? 
[02:34:00]  There's balconies across the way, pretty much all over the place, obviously, up and down Bourbon Street.  We're the only part of Bourbon Street that has not many people in front of us.  They're all on to us.  They're on to the beat thing.  They know we will knock your drink out of your hands.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock, and we're playing clips from Mardi Gras 2005.  The February 7th and February 8th shows combined into one gigantic mess for your listening pleasure. 
[02:34:30]  We're down in New Orleans.  There's not a whole lot going on because the music's too loud.  The people are too drunk.  It's hard to do a real show there.  Someone's throwing beer all over the place.  We just decide to throw beads at people, piss everyone off, and Jimmy just gets up and leaves the show to go negotiate something with a dancer.  What that is, I don't know.  Let's check it out.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program, live from Mardi Gras. 
[02:35:00]  The crazy horse.  We're on the balcony.  Here comes another girl, completely topless, with her boobs painted.  I hope I took out a full, huge, one of those big, giant-sized Budweiser right before we went on the air.  And it was with broken beads, which is even worse.  The guy doesn't even get beads out of it.  Wow.  He was very, very pissed.  And no, I didn't give him five bucks like your brother did.  Yeah, my brother was telling me the story in the bathroom.  He's like, yeah, man.  Like you said, you know, he takes out this girl's beer, and she started crying.  Yeah, she felt really mad. 
[02:35:30]  I thought you were exaggerating.  He goes, no, dude.  He goes, no, man, she was crying so bad that I took $5 out of my pocket.  I threw it in one of the Opie and Anthony mugs and threw it down to her so she could get another drink.  Yeah.  He's a softie.  I don't know if the T-shirt made the air because we were just coming back from break, but that guy got us good.  What did the show say again?  It said, you guys rock.  And I gave him the thumbs up.  And after I gave him the thumbs up, he turned it around and said, not you.  Look, he's going to get Jimmy.  Very nice. 
[02:36:00]  He just got him.  Oh.  That guy's really pissed off.  He's starting to throw all the beads back up at us.  Which guy?  This guy right over there.  Which guy?  This guy right here.  He's not happy.  Oh, that guy.  No, he's not.  He's wet, so I think somebody spilled his beer.  Everyone on our balcony, we got about, I don't know, 20 people up here.  They're all firing beads to hit people.  So now people are starting to shoot back.  And you really got to be careful where you're looking or not looking or you're going to get, someone's going to get hit with beads.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  I think we're going to talk to Lou Ferrigno in a few minutes.  Whoa.  This is a hell of a way to try to do a radio show.  How the hell are we going to do that?  I must say the phones are working a little better today.  We're able to talk to the listeners that are calling in without the delay.  Hopefully that will work for the Lou Ferrigno call.  Well, he's deaf, though.  I don't get that one.  I don't know how he, I don't know.  I thought he read lips or something.  I'm trying to get my brother on the air, but he needs a headset because he can't hear us. 
[02:37:00]  Where's Poe?  Is he still dancing on the street?  Poe, watch out.  I haven't seen him.  Oh, they knocked your equipment over.  He knocked my.  That almost took you out, Jimmy.  That's all right.  That was a close one.  He spilled my coffee.  That's all right.  I'll pick the beads up and throw them right back.  Knock that guy's wizard hat off.  No, he might have spent a lot of time earning it.  I'm going to do that to the poor fella.  So I'm going to grab Brett.  We're getting a lot of people coming in front of our balcony now because the Paris Hilton girl is starting to show ass. 
[02:37:30]  I know.  And titty.  And now we've got a bunch of homeboys stopping in front.  They seem to really like her.  And I'm trying to get a lap dance back there, and the fat guy in the purple is just hugging her and dancing.  And I'm like, ugh.  Yeah, on the way to the bathroom, Jimmy's like, I think I almost got the negotiations done.  You're going to get a lap dance from which one?  This one?  Yeah.  The Paris Hilton looking one?  Just for one song.  I was going to do it before we come back from break.  All right.  We got my brother back on the air here.  Oh, he's got the mic on backwards.  What are you doing, Brett?  It's on backwards. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, no, no, no.  It's got to be.  Yeah, there you go.  Just.  Now turn the.  No, put the thing on.  Right, right, right, right.  Now go back behind.  No, the other.  No, no, it's got to be the.  If you take.  You guys are messing with him so bad.  He's so confused now.  But turn the thing.  Right, right, right.  All right, there you go.  Now push it back.  Push it back.  But first do the.  Brett, they were just messing with you the whole time.  You know that.  Yeah.  You're taking it away from the beat, Austin.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Oh, they're pelting us now.  You know, I think they're organizing an attack down there. 
[02:38:30]  Now they're starting to go one, two, three.  All right.  Just me.  Yeah, they're.  All right, they're wailing him now.  It's all out-worn now.  Beat fight.  A beat fight.  Oh, shit, we are in trouble.  A beat fight.  No, we're out-gunned.  A beat fight has just broken out.  We are out-gunned up here now.  Who cares?  I'll throw a challenge.  Come on.  Let's see what you got.  Let's see what you got.  Watch out.  Let's see what you got.  Come on.  They have nothing, Anthony.  They have nothing.  Dude, they're on the ground.  We're on a balcony.  Wait till they.  Watch out.  They can also pick up the sleazy ones that are in the gutter. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, thanks.  Look at the beats he gives us to fight back with.  Oh, God.  Little BBs.  They look like ringworm.  No one's going to throw these.  Ringworm.  These aren't going to hurt.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Now they're fighting.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  Hey, that's a nice Bacardi necklace.  Thank you.  Oh, watch it.  They're selling it now.  Oh, we are going to get.  Whoa, whoa.  Jesus.  All right.  It's an all-out war.  They're laughing their asses off down there.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Goddamn bastards.  Fuck out.  All right.  They have figured it out.  We are screwed now. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, they're all starting to throw them back now.  High to the dip.  Oh, man.  Oh, what?  You can't get it up?  Can't get it up?  Come out of there, guy.  They're organizing an attack.  They're kind of going into little huddles, and they're doing like one, two, three now.  Yeah, they're all shooting at the same time.  He tried to distract them.  Look at this guy.  He's trying to figure out which beats he can lose to throw back at us.  Yeah, he's looking.  He's looking at all the beats around his neck going, hmm.  Oh, he's taking those big blue ones.  All right.  He's going with the pants. 
[02:40:00]  Come on.  Let's see what you got.  That red-headed boy.  He's rolling them up.  Whoa.  There he goes.  Look out.  Watch out for the distraction shot.  That's all right.  He's letting us know they're coming.  What a joke.  I know.  What a dullard.  Oh.  Nice.  That almost took out the window behind me.  You might have heard that on the air.  Watch out for the guy in the black.  Which guy in the black?  Another.  Oh.  Now there's anger.  Now there's anger involved.  He's acting all tough.  He's really pissed.  He just threw like a girl, and everyone started laughing at him around him. 
[02:40:30]  Find me a drink and knock it into someone's hand.  That's all I want to do.  Oh, he's trying to hit him now.  He's walking away.  All right.  Anyway, this is the Opie and Anthony program.  This is exactly what was going to happen.  If you send us down to Mardi Gras to broadcast live.  That's it.  I don't know what's going on with Luke Ferrigno.  I have a feeling it's just another guest that has blown us off, Anthony.  I don't think we have any guests on our show anymore.  They just.  You might.  Well, why don't they tell us then that Robert De Niro is going to be phoning in?  Dude, is that a doody?  What is that?  Ew.  Ew.  No, it's a string bean from the Bloody Mary. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  It does look like a doody.  A long, thin one.  The type Steve's awful stomach would put together.  Two weeks worth of food coming out in that one.  By the way, the reason I got my brother back on the show, he was talking about, there's  a lot of Jesus people down here.  Yeah.  Because they see a lot of sinners on the streets.  A lot of sinners that they want to save.  Of New Orleans.  Oh, you did another one.  What?  You took out somebody, Brett.  Now you're giving her money this time.  Brett.  So what do you see?  You saw people dragging a cross down Bourbon Street and they were dead serious, right? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  It was Jesus people, Anthony.  They're reenacting the crucifixion.  Yeah.  And they're slowly but surely dragging this cross right down the middle of Bourbon Street  and then they got their little helpers handing out, you know, Jesus saves type literature.  Yeah.  I've seen a lot of repent sinner.  And what was going on with that, Brett?  People have helped him with wow stickers.  Place them on their ass and they didn't even know it.  Yeah.  So they had wow stickers on the cross and the guy and they had no idea.  Oh, the guy caught it.  I was in it.  Dude.  And I just threw a set of beads down and the guy covered his beer the second it hit. 
[02:42:00]  I was robbed.  Where's Ben?  We're going to get Lou Ferrigno on or no?  Lou Ferrigno.  Yeah.  We're not being, we're told to call Lou and Lou's not answering his phone.  So.  Well, of course he's not answering his phone.  He doesn't know it's ringing.  He doesn't hear it's ringing.  Could you picture Lou just sitting there?  His phone's ringing away.  Lou's in his living room just looking at the phone, just whistling like.  And it's ringing in the background.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  By the way, you're, you got him inside, but you guys, when the beads are coming up and  nailing this window, the sound coming across the air is just, it's just like yesterday.  The show started kind of under control, but I mean, everyone is completely hammered down  on Bourbon Street now.  Nice.  And it's gone from tossing the beads nicely to these people to an all out war, an all out  war.  Yeah.  I'm just now trying to hit people right in the face.  Yeah.  I don't even care about their drinks.  Now I'm just throwing for their faces.  Oh, watch it. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, that's close.  I got it.  No problem.  Not even close.  Check your fire.  Check your fire.  It's only a flare.  It's only beads.  It's only beads.  Lance, you all right?  These are death beads.  Let's Charlie know who did this.  You know, I'm trying to come up with something here while we do the bead war here.  This guy on the cell phone right here.  Goodbye, beverage.  Oh, my God.  You hit him right in the face. 
[02:43:30]  He's on the phone.  Half his beer went flying out all over his face.  He wants to know who did it.  I would love to hear what that sounded like.  Yeah.  And well, our flight is scheduled to.  I'm hit.  Where is he?  Where is he?  No, he's very angry.  He is very angry.  I don't even see him.  They usually leave.  We were all going for the same guy that time. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, Brett's a good shot, man.  Yeah.  Oh, right there.  Right there.  That red ring.  Nice yellow shirt.  Right there.  Which one?  Right there.  Right there.  Oh, God.  You're mine, bitch.  What a disaster.  He nailed the beer, but the guy was able to hold on to it.  Yeah, I kind of blew his cover.  Yeah.  And once again, now we have no one in front of us because.  Just a bunch of guys who are ready to throw things up hard.  Oh, here goes a drink right below us.  Oh, he's holding his drink.  He knows about that guy right there.  Goodbye, beverage.  Oh, I hit his arm.  I missed a drink.  Oh, I hit his arm, too. 
[02:44:30]  All three of us hit his arm.  He was walking a little too fast.  We should tell people we're at least 20 to 25 feet off the ground, too.  You let him too much is what it is.  All right, well.  You throw beads at women and children?  Oh!  Got to wait in his drink.  That guy was actually very happy.  And the listeners down below.  Nice shot.  Nice shot.  Yeah, we have a cheering section who, in between cheering, throws stuff at us.  Yeah.  It's wonderful. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, watch out for that cup.  All right, here's a chick drinking a beverage in an awful 1970s blackploitation hat.  She's looking up, though, now.  Yeah, wait until she looks away.  There you go.  Look away, whore.  Look away, whore.  Goodbye.  Oh, you got distracted.  Oh, here we go.  Guy in a top hat.  Full beer.  Full beer.  That's brand new.  Let her rip.  Oh, Jesus.  It hit the hat or he would have taken out that beer.  He's pissed. 
[02:45:30]  He's not too happy about that.  No, look.  The Fox News guy.  The Fox News guy is filming us right now.  The local Fox News guy.  Where?  Knock the cigar out of his mouth.  Hit him in the head.  Here's one.  Nail the Fox News guy.  Oh, this woman.  Why are they buying us these faggity beads?  These beads are worthless.  They got no weight to them.  Hey, can you get me some feathers?  I want to throw them down.  These beads suck.  You got to double them up.  You need like anvils.  Excuse me, Opie.  I'm not bending down here to pleasure you. 
[02:46:00]  That's nice.  I'm trying to grab more beads.  Where'd that dancer go?  Those beads are so small, you should just throw the whole pack.  I'd throw the bag without even opening it.  All right, right below us, there's some beverages here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, right there, right there.  Oh, that guy's on to us.  Hey, give me a big one.  Is there any big ones over there?  Whoa.  Watch it, watch it.  Wow.  Hey, Kenny, is there any?  That was a good shot.  Somebody almost nailed us.  Those purple ones?  Thanks.  I want to hit the Fox News guy's cigar out of his mouth. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you hit the...  That was very close.  I hit the guy's hat.  All right.  Oh, right on the side of the head.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch it.  Here comes a...  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It's beads tied up in a shirt.  Now they're wrapping up beads in a T-shirt.  That'll knock you out if it hit you on the head.  I like that.  Oh, wait.  I think they're...  I think they're actually...  Oh, cleavage right there.  All right.  With the drink with the lime in it.  Where?  Go ahead. 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Nice drive.  Here goes the guy right here drinking.  Which one?  How about that fat...  That fat whore?  That's a guy.  It's a girl.  I don't know what it is.  I...  That's what it was.  The you guys rock, not you T-shirt we were just talking about.  I think they want us to sign it because there's a Sharpie in the T-shirt.  Oh, very good.  All right.  Very nice.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  You know this sounds like absolute crap on the radio at this point, right?  That's what we're here for.  To sound like crap? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  This is what Mardi Gras is.  Just three douchebags standing on there pelting people with feet.  Oh, wait.  This girl wants to show her boobs.  Come on.  Of course, the fat one does.  Look at her.  Yeah, let's...  Come on.  Let's see those slobby breasts of yours.  Come on.  Let's see them.  We don't want to see them.  Come on.  We'll...  Here we go.  Here we go.  Show them.  Show those slob.  Big slob.  Yeah.  All right.  She's walking away.  We got two.  Come on.  I can see sweat stains under her arms.  Damn it.  She's got back tits.  Again. 
[02:48:00]  Here's a couple of nice ones right there.  Three guys pelted them.  Oh.  This guy's pissed, and he's looking right up at me.  I didn't do it.  Which guy?  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  It's Jimmy.  You can't tattle.  I didn't do it.  I wasn't tattling.  He thinks it's me.  He's all pissed off.  Hit him.  Oh, I hit him right in the face.  I hit him right in the face.  Oh, my God.  He is so.  He is livid pissed off.  Let him walk away.  Goodbye, stupid.  Where is he?  I'll hit him again.  I missed him.  Where is he now? 
[02:48:30]  In the red shirt?  Yeah.  Is that him?  You got him again.  You got him three times.  I dare you to hit the little girl's drink out of it.  Nah, I don't want to throw it at the kid.  I know.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  Oh.  Wow.  Now, that was a fun shot.  Right in the face.  There's a guy sipping out of a gigantic, tall, plastic grenade-looking thing, and Anthony  just hit him right in the face where the straw was meeting his little Mardi Gras lips.  Oh, that was funny.  And he doesn't move.  He's just standing there drinking.  Because he's looking at the wrong balcony. 
[02:49:00]  He has no idea.  It's right above his stupid head.  I'm going to get him again.  And you hit him right in the head.  All right.  You just almost took his glasses right off his head.  George Lopez right in the face.  Twice.  And is he moving?  No, he's still not moving.  I will hit him a third time.  He's like a cow in a fire.  He's just going to stand there until his energy blows out.  He's still not moving.  He's still standing, trying to figure out where the beads are coming from.  Yep.  And there goes a third time.  We hit them both at the same time.  Yeah, Brett and Anthony just hit him once in the head and once in the shoulder.  Oh, he's firing back.  He's firing back.  Oh, no. 
[02:49:30]  He just hit me with wet.  And he hits Jimmy with sleaze beads from the street.  Ah, I got wet beads.  Oh, Jimmy.  Norton's out.  Jimmy's an innocent bystander in the whole thing.  Nah, I'm not innocent.  And now he's walking away.  I just got wet beads all over me.  That was disgusting.  Jimmy had to take the brunt of it.  Smell my arm.  No.  Smell where the beads hit.  Smell my arm.  Smell my arm.  It smells like sewer.  It smells like Voss's ear.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:50:00]  My name is E-Rock.  And we're bringing to a conclusion the fun festivities that was Mardi Gras of 2005.  I've hoped you enjoyed it so far.  I know I have.  But in this last segment here for you, what are we going to do?  We're wrapping up two days of partying and drinking and eating and having fun in New Orleans from Mardi Gras.  Live on Bourbon Street.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So, I guess just play it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:50:30]  We understand this is a cluster F.  We're broadcasting live from Mardi Gras.  And I got the phones out here, Anthony.  We're going to try to answer some phones.  Oh, you got the phones out here?  You're going to take phone calls from the balcony?  We're insane.  How the hell are you doing that?  By the way, where are we going tonight?  Are we going to go see Greg Alden tonight?  I don't know.  I might go to the Gold Club.  You're going to go to the Gold Club.  I want to see Greg Orman at the House of Blues tonight.  Wow.  I got to give someone props.  They got filthy beads in my Bloody Mary.  Nice. 
[02:51:00]  Now I can't drink it.  All right, Anthony, my score is 15 people's drinks.  Here we go.  People won.  Right below us.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I got it in his drink.  But it splashed.  But it didn't knock it out of his hand.  It splashed back up.  Oh, Jesus.  Look out.  There's this old guy down here right there that's really pissed off.  Is he?  Yeah, throw it at his head.  Watch.  Oh, Jerry Garcia?  Yeah, this guy.  I'm just helping him.  This guy will not give up.  He just keeps picking up beads and he keeps throwing them.  Watch this guy.  He keeps throwing them back up at us. 
[02:51:30]  Whoa.  Okay.  Now they're throwing full beer up at us.  For years.  Wow.  I just got showered by that beer.  That guy and his fat girlfriend threw up a full beer.  Which guy?  The beer might have taken out the phone system.  Okay.  Thank you for that.  There are some angry, angry...  We made some real friends here today.  Now they're pelting us with beer.  He threw a full beer can up.  I wish I would have went through the window. 
[02:52:00]  I got to give up on the phones because it just got showered with beer.  Oh, now it won't work?  Sorry about that, Jaime.  Yeah, I can't answer phones anymore.  They're really starting to throw the beads like crazy here.  You know what I'm saying?  There's an old codger, this old curmudgeon, that's throwing beads back up at everybody  here on the balcony.  And your brother just grabbed a handful of beads and as hard as he could, threw them  right at his head.  Like, he's not taking any guff.  Let me try the phones again, Jaime.  It's amazing.  Jimmy's feeling the itch.  You know that. 
[02:52:30]  Wait, wait.  He's gone with the program.  You want a Jimmy update?  Yeah, Jimmy update.  Yeah, what's going on?  Club Soda County, yes.  I think he's spending some cash as we speak.  As we speak.  During the show, he decided he's going to get some.  You know he's got no willpower.  Now, here's the deal with Jimmy.  I mean, he is a sex addict, and when he gets the urge, he will put everything online.  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  He'll walk off the radio show, and he'll take care of the itch, and then he'll be back,  and then he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the radio program, and then he'll be able 
[02:53:00]  to enjoy the rest of the night.  We understand.  When he gets the addiction in his blood, he can't help himself, and he's off taking care  of business.  Yeah.  Can you go with the Paris Hilton girl?  The ugly Paris Hilton, yeah.  The Paris Hilton on crack girl?  Yeah.  Paris Econowodge.  Yeah.  I understand him, though.  If we would tell him to stay here instead of do that, he'd be totally worthless to the  show, because his mind is just completely taken with getting sex.  Yeah, there's no way we could talk about him.  Yeah.  No way whatsoever. 
[02:53:30]  He's a sex addict, is what he is.  Everyone knows he's got that addictive personality.  He can't do any type of drugs or booze anymore, because he's just too addictive, and sex is  the one thing he hasn't sworn off.  Yeah.  And now, like anyone else that's addicted to something, it doesn't matter, work, something  like that, he's just off now trying to get sex.  Because I was amazed that he went out to dinner with us last night, but he said, you know,  he took care of business in one of these strip clubs, and he said he was able to relax and  just hang, and I saw that.  That's what it is.  It's just a matter of releasing for him, and the girl doesn't even have to be, she has 
[02:54:00]  to barely be there.  Yeah.  As long as he's got his hand, he's a happy man.  What are the odds that XM will allow us to go back on the road after this broadcast?  Not to Mardi Gras, that's for sure.  We did, what else did we do remotes from?  Where else have we been?  Vegas.  Vegas was fine, see?  Vegas was good, and we're going to be in Los Angeles two weeks from today.  Right, but it's just, Mardi Gras is just drunks hanging around throwing beads. 
[02:54:30]  And they're everywhere, too, because we set up this little area where we can broadcast  live, but all the people inside, they're completely hammered.  They're crawling on our couch.  I think people are having sex on the couch who are just broadcasting from only a half  hour ago.  That's why when I was sitting on there, I was a little, you know, skeeted out.  Yeah, you were worried about a booger.  Yeah, I know, and I'm sitting on Jiz's couch.  I have no idea what has been going on on that couch, but you can only imagine.  Club Soda Canning, what's going on with you?  I'm just trying to keep the fans in line, but I just wanted to thank you guys for a 
[02:55:00]  wonderful trip to Mardi Gras, and I want just the fans to know how terrific you fellas  are.  Well, I don't think we're that terrific today, but that's okay.  We were stressing about yesterday's show, and then we realized, you know, there's nothing  we can do to make this better.  It's just a cluster up.  It's one big booze fest.  Oh, these are drunks that have a midlife crisis.  Yeah, this is the land of the raging alcoholics.  We saw more guys dressed as fairies today after breakfast. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Kenny and I are like thinking, anywhere else you dress like a fairy, you're going to get  laughed at.  But down here, you're like, wow, man, that's cool.  You go.  Yeah, it's completely acceptable.  Someone just got a Bloody Mary knocked out of their hand and was very angry down there.  And he was very angry to get an empty Opie and Anthony XM cup in return.  Yeah.  I mean, are they guarding the door down there, by the way?  Because there's a few people that really want to shot.  They want to punch us in the head.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy's back.  Yes.  What happened? 
[02:56:00]  I got a lap dance.  It was very nice.  From what?  The Paris Hilton girl?  Yeah.  I'm leaking stuff.  I'm leaking stuff.  I don't want to see that.  Lumping his pants.  Why are they yelling and screaming up here now?  Well, look at that guy dressed in.  He's dressed in a skirt and he's got pigtails and a goatee.  Oh.  Yeah, but, you know, it's acceptable down here.  All right.  Well, look at the streets.  I mean, it is.  I haven't seen so much garbage in my life. 
[02:56:30]  Well, now I don't.  And there's also a lot of beads on the ground.  Oh, that's terrific.  Cut it out.  You know what the scary thing is?  How long is it going to take them to realize they could just.  And how drunk they can get before they realize they could just pick up these sleaze beads  and lob them up here and pelt us with disgusting street sleaze beads.  I hope they don't realize that.  Now, they haven't been able to really organize down there.  No.  They really haven't.  What's our schedule, by the way? 
[02:57:00]  We're flying tomorrow.  Then we do real radio again Thursday and Friday?  Thursday.  I think tomorrow is our travel day.  Okay.  And then Thursday and Friday back live 6 to 10 in the morning.  Oh, brother.  Oh, Jaime's like, Jaime, what happened?  You're just getting pissed off?  Jaime's pissed off because I think we wrecked his laptop.  Yeah.  So he just handed us, like, the Mac Daddy of beads, like, bags and bags of beads.  We didn't wreck his laptop.  Some troublemaker did.  We're just trying to have some Mardi Gras fun.  Oh.  All right.  Everyone is digging into the beads.  Going for the heavy ones, too.  Now we got heavy ones.  All right.  Let's see what these guys got. 
[02:57:30]  There will not be a safe drink.  All right.  All right.  Watch this little orange soda go.  Is she too young?  How old is that girl there?  Is she young?  I won't hit her if she's young.  Okay.  Well, if she's drinking a soda, that could be an indication she might be too young.  All right.  That's a lot.  That old guy is still down there, and he's winging beads up.  Look out.  Here comes another one.  Where is he?  Look at this.  This brother is a perfect target, but no one will take the shot.  Where's the old guy?  The old guy is just, I don't know.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, a two.  Holy crap.  Best shot of the day. 
[02:58:00]  Best shot of the day.  Best shot of the day.  Best shot of the two days, dude.  Dude, I just got a couple walking down the street with two drinks and one in each hand  and knocked the couple of drinks out of their hands.  Two drinks, shot of the day.  It was a boyfriend-girlfriend combination.  Both enjoying themselves, holding hands, and they both had a hurricane, and you knocked  out both hurricanes.  Both of them in one shot.  Now I got to try this lady right down here.  No one's going to beat that shot.  Oh, God, you just hit her in the chest. 
[02:58:30]  You just hit her in the chest.  It was him.  It was him.  You can't be a dick, boy.  It was him.  What's wrong with you?  It was him right here.  It was him.  Don't rat him out.  I'm getting him back for a...  That's not good.  You can't break that.  That's a cardinal rule.  You can't do that.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Can't do that.  No blaming anyone.  All right.  See this guy here with the drink in the backpack?  He just turned around.  Damn it.  A cup of coffee in that guy's hand?  What do you think?  Where, where, where?  The Vikings.  Oh, coffee is hot.  Here we go.  Oh, you hit him. 
[02:59:00]  I spilled a little of it.  Right in the head.  If he didn't have that stupid, faggoty, choking Vikings hat on,  he would be wearing hot coffee on his wrist and forearm.  He took a head shot.  These beads are the perfect size, man.  All right.  The sounds of Mardi Gras.  Look out.  Look out.  They're firing back.  See, so the brothers with the big ganja leaf necklaces are on their neck.  Yeah.  Smoking the reefer.  And that was before they got here. 
[02:59:30]  People shuffling by.  For some reason, they're really looking up at this balcony when they walk by.  Yeah, I think they're on to us.  Yeah, they're firing back.  They're organizing.  They're organizing.  They're organizing.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let them.  Nothing.  They got nothing.  They got nothing.  They just can't get it together.  All right.  Hey, another couple.  This guy looks mean, though.  Shaved head.  Look at his chick.  Big red drink. 
[03:00:00]  I'm going for him.  Wow.  There's so many bouts.  He's a big guy.  Oh, my God.  Is he a big dude?  He's going to kick my ass.  No, it didn't even phase him.  Oh, good.  You hit him on the skull, and he could care less.  He didn't even notice.  He didn't even notice.  He thought it was a fly landed on his head.  I can hit him again, but I'll choose not to.  He's got a big scar across his head like that.  Yeah, I wouldn't chance that.  Come on, Nick.  Catch it.  Oh, that was a good catch. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Looking next target.  Yeah, that guy's looking up here, though.  Which guy?  The shaved head guy with the...  Oh, someone just got nailed.  Someone down on the other side of the balcony just got nailed hard.  Those big bowling ball-sized beads are completely ridiculous.  Yeah, they're oversized beads that some of the guys  are walking around in.  Yeah.  How did he even move through a crowd wearing those?  You know how much those cost in the gift shops? 
[03:01:00]  I heard they're 80 bucks.  80 bucks for that.  And $5 if you go three blocks away.  The beads are almost as big as bowling balls,  just to give you an idea.  And you look cool down here,  but then you go home to your little hometown,  and people like you spent $80 on what?  Look at two guys dressed like Kiss.  That's pretty good makeup there.  Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.  I should go down there and get blown off for a picture.  Oh, very close.  I saw a guy dressed like Gene before.  He didn't have the makeup, but he had a nozzle hanging off him. 
[03:01:30]  Too bad there's no car crash sound.  Right there.  Certainly deserved it.  Oh, so close.  The guy's thanking you, Anthony.  He had no idea you were trying to take out his drink.  If I don't take the drink out, they thank us.  They look up and go, thanks for the beads.  Wow, the crowd growing in numbers here in front of our balcony.  Yep.  For some reason, I think we're missing enough  that they're thinking we're giving away beads  instead of trying to hurt them with them. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, what about that chick?  She's showing.  Look.  Not bad, right?  That one right there is very nice.  She's smelling her drink.  Like, oh, you drunk whore.  Yeah.  I don't get that with the girls.  A lot of girls, they can't just show the boobs.  They have to stick out their tongue and make the stupid.  I'm showing you.  Look at the stupid face.  I'm showing you my boobs face.  I'm getting all the sexiness right out of it.  Hit the guy on the little rascal.  I'm so tempted.  Come on.  He looks like the guy that they paralyzed in Clockwork Orange.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, we just hit him in the head, you heartless bastard.  I can't believe you just hit an old man on a little rascal. 
[03:02:30]  You are a heartless bastard.  And he's looking up.  Bastard.  He's angry.  Hey, they enjoyed it.  He clocked the guy with a little rascal.  He was a little double-gover.  He's a real tough target at .3 miles an hour, Opie.  All five of those listeners that were just looking up are just rolling, and they had to walk away.  They can't take it, because Opie's a heartless prick.  All the anger I felt today.  Oh, wait.  This beautiful girl is going to show us.  Oh.  Wait.  She's taking her pants down.  What's she doing?  She's taking her belt off.  She's a 10.  Got a girl taking her belt off.  She's taking her belt off. 
[03:03:00]  I want to be Barbie, her shirt says.  All right.  Hold on.  She's.  All right.  This girl has the tightest jeans on, and she just took her belt off.  She's pulling her.  Wow.  She's pulling her pants down.  Her pants down.  Nice.  Now she's turning to us, and she's going to show us her ass.  I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't for those grandma panties.  Yeah, what are those?  Wow.  No, that's not bad ass.  Those are the hot pants.  Throw beads in her ass.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Yeah.  There you go.  That was very sweet.  Now knock it.  Now knock it.  Knock the drink out of her hands. 
[03:03:30]  Where is your drink?  She's well protected.  How about, no, he doesn't have enough in there.  She's well protected.  I like getting full drinks when they splat on the ground.  It's so satisfying.  This guy's got a mug, but it's not up to his face.  It's also a lot more pleasurable when they're drinking it, and it splashes right into their mug.  We're looking.  We're looking.  There's no targets right now, huh?  No.  I can't believe I took out two of that one shot.  There's more boobs over there.  Very nice. 
[03:04:00]  No more guys on there.  Little rascals, huh?  It's getting later.  A lot of people getting more drunken, and you're seeing more boobies.  All right.  It's no pot, I think.  Oh, that girl just fell in the dirtiest water.  Look at her.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, she is pissed.  Oh, she fell in that filthy, awful water.  She just slid on her ass.  That's going to be all in her private area.  Yeah.  She will not be happy.  Come on, girl. 
[03:04:30]  Come on.  One more good target.  What are you telling us, Steve?  You need it.  I'm addicted to screwing these people's drinks up.  All right, guy in the gray shirt right here.  Pink drink, gray shirt.  Where, where, where?  All three of us.  No, wait, wait.  Green armband.  Oh, I forgot that guy right there.  One.  Go.  Two.  Three.  Oh, we missed.  Oh, damn it.  Did we get him?  No.  Oh, no.  She lost her drink.  Oh, she dropped hers.  She's all pissed.  Oh, look at her.  Look at her.  She's looking around.  She can't believe it. 
[03:05:00]  She's yelling.  She's yelling.  She's screaming.  Uh-huh.  That's what you get, whore.  She has no idea.  She has nothing.  Look, they're looking around, like, trying to figure it out.  Here.  You want these?  Yeah.  Oh, she's, she's.  Oh, she's yelling.  What happened?  What happened?  She's screaming at us.  Who cares?  Oh, is she crying?  Good.  What happened?  Beat it, stupid.  What happened?  You're 15.  You shouldn't be drinking.  She's crying.  She's very, very upset.  That's the sign of a true alcoholic.  Oh, she's mad. 
[03:05:30]  Well, we're just about done with our Mardi Gras broadcast from the crazy horse.  Is that what we were doing?  Yeah, pretty much.  I thought for some reason we were just hanging out with these stupid headsets on.  Okay.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, she's so upset.  What a sourpuss.  Yeah, she's still bummed out over there, huh?  I want to now get her friend's drink out of her hand.  The one that's being videotaped?  How about the guy's Coke right there?  Dude.  Oh, she's mad.  It's going to go right into her face.  Oh.  It actually landed right on his drink. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Now she's pissed.  Now she's taking the beads off her neck and slamming them down to the pavement.  You know why?  Because it hit his Coke and splashed soda into her face.  It splashed all over her face.  I don't know what happened.  She's yelling at us again.  She is pissed.  Why doesn't she just move on?  She doesn't get it.  She's crying.  She is so angry.  She's crying.  Oh, my God.  Is she crying?  And they're standing there, so I'm going to throw another one at that guy's same drink.  Wait, just make sure that no one looks up.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, she's covering it.  I won't even look at her, though.  I'm looking like I have no idea. 
[03:06:30]  Look, she's telling her boyfriend there to cover the drink.  Cover the drink.  Cover, cover.  Here we go.  Okay, see it?  It's exposed.  She's yelling at us.  She's so angry.  Look, they're distracted.  Now watch.  Oh, that was probably good.  Oh, damn it.  That came up short.  It was perfect.  That's a horrible shot.  I don't know why they will not move on.  It's stubbornness.  It's just not.  Okay, here we go.  They're defiant for some reason.  They're trying to show that they can.  Oh, it went around her neck. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, my God.  You got it right around her neck.  You got the beads on her.  No, she's wearing the beads.  I'm trying to give this couple of hey-go, ladies.  I don't know.  She's all pissed off.  Are they mad now?  They're getting mad at us.  Who cares?  Watch this.  I don't care.  I'm going to take out her video camera.  No.  Oh, my God.  Screw it.  Oh, Jesus.  Soapy.  That's a whole bag of beads you're throwing.  No, I'll throw the whole bag.  Don't do that.  Don't throw the whole bag.  No, don't do that.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  I'm taking that girl's drink out.  I'm taking her drink out right now. 
[03:07:30]  Take it out.  Oh, you just missed.  Damn it.  You just missed it.  So close.  All right.  Pick it up.  It's right there.  She's taunting me.  Here you go.  Here.  Take those.  There you go.  Oh, Christ.  There was liquid in this one.  Oh, right there.  Beer.  It's raining.  All right, Anthony.  We're going to wrap up the festivities here from the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street.  Hit it.  All right, go.  We're out of here.  Bye.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that smell?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM. 
[03:08:00]  Hey, Bob Kelly.  How are...  What the hell is this?  Are you auditioning for the Blues Brothers movie or...  Are you fucking going to court?  What are you doing?  Let's hope he winds up like Belushi.  What do you got?  I, uh...  See, he's got some VHS tapes.  And you're looking skinny, by the way.  Oh, Bobby.  Hey, how you guys doing?  You're handsome.  Hey.  Go ahead.  I, uh...  I just wanted to, uh...  Drop these off.  Um...  And the reason why I'm dressed like this is probably because after I give you these, I'm  probably going to have to get a day job. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, no.  So I figured I would...  I would actually start getting used to wearing a suit and tie.  Oh, this is gold.  And shaving and showering in the morning.  I'm sure this is gold.  I have three tapes.  The first one, not so bad.  This is me as a VJ, like an MTV VJ, on the Burlington Man Network, which was a college  network, only pumped into colleges, my first month in New York City.  Very good-looking, young Bob Kelly.  All right.  Very bad. 
[03:09:00]  I'll take that one home.  People are getting into this old-school bit, man.  I love it.  I have number two.  Yeah.  These are the two first movies I ever did.  Last Night at Eddie's and The Koala Bear Kid.  Ew.  The Koala Bear Kid?  It's actually, if you see the movie, you'll understand the name.  Okay.  What, does Koala Bear mean douchebag?  The Koala Bear Kid actually has a cameo performance by a good friend of the show, Billy Burr, who 
[03:09:30]  looks like a red-headed Mexican in this.  And the second one is actually, I am the romantic lead.  Oh.  My name is Dylan.  In The Koala Bear Kid, Bob?  And, no, in the Last Night at Eddie's, I am the romantic lead.  I have very long hair.  Very young Bob Kelly.  Ah.  Very gorgeous.  Very sexy.  And one of my lines at the end is, I love you, Allison.  I always have.  Oh.  Very bad.  And this third one, it took me all night. 
[03:10:00]  Uh-oh.  To actually decide to give this to you guys.  Deal it!  Deal it!  I actually, I swear to God, I prayed on this one.  Yeah.  Because I didn't know if I should give you guys, because this is the one you've been waiting  for.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  This is, this by far, my wife, who loves me, who loves me to death, who is biased, you  know, couldn't watch this last night.  Couldn't watch this.  Wow.  What was it, you said from the cellar Saturday?  I was waiting for any one of you guys to hit something on the park. 
[03:10:30]  This one is, uh, this is a tape from me in Boston, uh, back in the day.  Mm-hmm.  Very good looking Bob Kelly.  My gosh.  Very good looking Bob Kelly.  Very cute.  But a very untalented Bob Kelly.  And, uh, this is probably the worst, I couldn't even watch this.  This, this sent, uh, douche shivers up my spine.  What is it, exactly? 
[03:11:00]  This is me doing stand-up.  With Dane Cook.  Please say.  Not Alan the Monkees?  I, well, I have Alan the Monkees.  Uh-huh.  I do have Alan the Monkees.  This is worse?  This is worse than Alan the Monkees, because of the, the crowd work that I do in this, the,  the, the, so wanting to be liked, and my Boston accent in this is so atrocious.  There's certain things I do in this that, to get a laugh and actually get a laugh, that 
[03:11:30]  are, I, I just can't believe I did it.  Tell me one.  I, instead of, I don't know what this, why I did this, but instead of, uh, saying something  funny, sometimes I'd just scream to get my point across, and then I'd go, why would  you do that?  Don't do that even here now.  No, you wouldn't.  I would go, she's nuts.  I can relate.  I had a boo-boo-boo thing that I used to do.  Oof.  Oof. 
[03:12:00]  Oof.  So this one is very, this is very bad.  This is going to come back to haunt me.  How about this?  First of all.  Yes.  You're not doing this Friday, because I'm gone.  Yeah, you, you have to come in tomorrow now.  Yeah, you definitely, you just got your invite for tomorrow's show.  You're not.  You can't do this with Jimmy Sawyer.  You're not sneaking this shit on the air while I'm in fucking Atlanta.  Listen, I think Friday is a great day to do it.  No, it's not.  Listen, hang on just a second.  No, it's not.  No, I think Friday is a great day because, listen, Friday, it's going to be me, you, and 
[03:12:30]  Ant, and I think that'd be a lot of fun.  Oh, no.  I think it'd be a lot of fun.  No, no.  These things, these things, with these tapes, the more, the merrier.  You, you, you fucking, you know, trying to sell tickets.  She's crazy.  Were you hoping that was going to be your thing?  When you walked out on stage, the whole audience would be like,  That was going to be my Sufi.  It comes to the Iraqi woman. 
[03:13:00]  I'd walk out on stage at Madison Square Garden in front of 18,000 people.  Just hear them all going, I'd walk out and go, what's up, motherfuckers?  And I'd hear, you know, Bobby, I was just thinking of something.  I know you're going to be at Helium Comedy Club down there in Philly starting tonight,  right?  Actually, we have Wednesday.  Oh, it's starting tomorrow night?  No, tonight, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I would imagine when you're there for the next few days, I don't think there'll be a lot  of people actually doing a, as you walk out onto the stage. 
[03:13:30]  Do we have anything that can hook a VCR up to our, we can't just watch this now for like  a minute.  We can't get a minute of this now.  Danny, we got anything?  Can we transfer this?  We need a, we could transfer it, definitely.  But I mean, if you guys want to watch it right now, I don't know.  No, no, no.  Well, if you just get a minute, can we just get like a minute of it?  Just be careful with this, this gem, Danny.  Yeah.  Just get it, just get it on disc for us.  Just like a side, you can't come in tomorrow?  No, I actually switched all my radio to Thursday, tomorrow. 
[03:14:00]  All right, so what we'll do is, there's no way we're doing this Friday.  Let's just do it Friday.  No.  Listen, just hear me out.  How about you come in Monday to tell us how great the shows were in Philly?  I have to.  I think we should, I think we should know, because that will give you time to get like other  people in here.  We got a real busy show for Friday.  You know, I'm with Jimmy.  I'm saying.  We're going to have to wait on this one.  But Friday, listen, what we can do is.  No, the guy's going to need time to go through the tapes, you know.  I'm thinking Monday.  I'm thinking Monday or Tuesday.  The only reason why, the only reason why is because I had many, I had many laughs on 
[03:14:30]  your stupid hot air balloon show.  Right, right.  It was very funny, and I had many laughs on him rubbing his dumb head and on his stupid  stand-up, but this by far trumps anything stupid you guys have done.  You really do understand.  And this, this is terrible.  That you're not doing this Friday.  Of course it's terrible.  This is terrible.  This is.  So please, because Bobby doesn't want to be distracted.  Do you understand that you're actually making this actually my sofa?  Hey, no.  Don't do that.  Yeah, we're going to do it now. 
[03:15:00]  Don't do that at helium.  It'd be distracting.  When he walks out.  He'll feel like an asshole.  He certainly will.  When he walks out.  Yeah.  If he walks out, like he's an older man now, and you all just go.  No, no, you're mixing it up with yours.  What was it?  Yours is.  Mine is.  Oh, it's a little different.  It's this.  There it is.  Why scallop?  I don't know.  That's what I used to do.  Why?  Why?  How would the hand go? 
[03:15:30]  Show the hand.  Show the hand.  Oh, that is stupid.  Really?  I wouldn't do that.  We're trying to trump each other with awfulness.  So if we get that on the air.  Yes.  I will finally bring in a boo-boo-boo for everybody.  Wow.  That's brave.  I ended every phone call back in the day with a boo-boo-boo.  A boo-boo.  Something like that.  That should be dead.  Something like that.  And then it followed me everywhere. 
[03:16:00]  I would do bar gigs and people would go to my page and do the new one.  How did you do that?  How did that start?  I don't know.  How does anything become that?  I don't know.

[03:27:00]  i don't know how  you did this  no there's gold  in them  our hills  hey hey  go and join  this is the worst  of all pn3  serious xm  i mean it's no  twisted sister  no apparently  twisted uh  wow right back  into the fray  into the rock  and roll fray  opie  well  with a song  called 30  and we like d  d's done our  show a few times  yeah  and uh you know  we don't mind  the guy but  and he's a very  talented guy but  but wow  yeah uh 
[03:27:30]  it's a new song  from twisted sister  called 30  lyrics are reminiscent  of jimmy's  they're back  they're back  it is  pure  hokeyness  this uh  from what i've  heard  pure  hokeyness  this song is  horrendous  where where i think  the theme of this  whole thing is  you know  they they  when they when  they turned 30  they thought you  know that was it  over the hill  and stuff  now that they're 
[03:28:00]  way past 30  they're realizing  you know  you could still  rock dude  but  but that's an  old concept  no shit  you know when  that was relevant  when mick jagger  turned 30  like holy  shit  wow  you're still  rocking  now that you  got the stones  still on tour  and they're in  their 60s  this is  this is  not relevant  to anything  no  and the way  they went about  pretty much  every rocker  is over 30  at this point 
[03:28:30]  a majority  of them are  yeah  but the way  they they go  about it  it's like  metallica  awful  those guys  are what  mid 40s  at this point  danny  gotta be  all right  so they're  in their  mid 40s  so d schneider  and twisted  sister  they're gonna  come out  with a song  called 30  and it's  supposed to  be relevant  30  metallica  is rocking  hard  and they're  on their  way to  50  i think  what they're  saying is  that they're  not 30  they're  so far  over 30  and they  thought 30  was like  you know  gonna be  the wall 
[03:29:00]  plus shouldn't  he have  written this  song about  15 years  ago  how old  is d schneider  he's gotta  be pushing  50  yeah exactly  so why is  he why does  he have a song  out called  30  shouldn't it be  called 50  and then maybe  it all makes  sense  i don't really  know  does anyone know  you gotta  listen to the  lyrics  he's 54  so he's 54  and he's singing  about being  30  you gotta listen  to the lyrics  man  alright  well it's  released as a  bonus track 
[03:29:30]  on the 25th  anniversary edition  of stay hungry  why do you need  a 25th  anniversary edition  of stay hungry  the one you got  isn't it still  good enough  wrong with the  one you got  what could possibly  make it more  important  doesn't have 30  on it  i don't get  that when it  comes to movies  as well  25th you know  anniversary edition  of star wars  or whatever  they usually throw  something in there  a little something  like sling blade  you wanna hear a  little piece of 
[03:30:00]  is that released  today  what  it's already  shipped  it's on it  blu-ray  sling blade  sling blade on  blu-ray is out  today everybody  why do you need  it on blu-ray  to see carl  in hd glory  and there's  gonna be  there's little  extras  but you don't  really need to  see that movie  in blu-ray  oh yeah  well it's not  i mean you know  it's not like  action packed  with effects and  everything but  you know  i mean if i have  a blu-ray player  and i'm gonna  purchase a dvd i  might as well  get you know  the current format  yeah  all right  uh i do have  to acknowledge  the cry cry cry  song might have  fell flat  all right 
[03:30:30]  oh are you  catching a lot  of shit  it might have  felt a little  flat  i could give a  shit about  freeing the  children  and cry cry  crying  it just uh  it just sounded  like a song from  another era  that's all  yeah  an era gone  by  what is that  uh spill the  wine like that  type of you  know  just kind of  that it's just  a chill  groovy  you're just  grooving  smoking your  dope  yeah man  yeah maybe  if we were  all stoned  uh wait  you're surprised  that the band  who has giant  hair wears  makeup and made  a record called  stay hungry 
[03:31:00]  wrote a corny  song  yeah  it's just that  it is reminiscent  of jimmy's  it the whole  concept is pretty  much we're back  and better than  ever we're back  together forever  scott m from  hoppog  like on lars's  forehead  scott m from  hoppog writes  uh even when  they had long  hair though  you had that  forehead  yeah yeah  the album was  stay hungry  maybe the song  title is actually  thirsty  want to hear a  little of this  uh do i ever 
[03:31:30]  tell me when it  gets bad  uh it got bad  right there  now that's like  dated guitar right  yeah  can we get the  lyrics to this  we never had the  time to plan our  lives past 30 
[03:32:00]  so now here's  what it is  it's not 30  it's they're past  30  way past  they never  thought about  planning anything  past 30  because once they  hit 30  you always assume  once you hit 30  it's over  but they realize  dude  they're still  rocking  even though  they're way  past 30  like 30  was that wall  but are they  really rocking  no  not at all  this is  they're schlocking  this is horrible  30 
[03:32:30]  heard it  wow  30  heard it  you sure this  isn't a morning  zoo  song parody  i know  there's some  shoehorning  they're shoehorning  they're trying to  rhyme 30  30 with heard it  with heardy  30 heard  i thought he was  gonna say heardy  i swear i thought  he was gonna say  heardy  he just said  heardy  but we love 
[03:33:00]  d  i can't drive  55  never gave a damn  about the other  side of the hill  because when you  hit 30  they say  you're over  the hill  right  so all right  never gave a damn  about the other  side of the hill  but 30's the new  20 or whatever  the fuck they say  so this is an  old concept  this is a very  old concept  no it's not  about 30  man  let's play a game 
[03:33:30]  i love games  raise your hand  when uh  when you  when you hear  another song  within this song  okay  because we got  the sammy  hagar  i can't drive  55  yeah yeah  and you can  play along  at home  probably on  one of the  uh  the  you know  the  little chat  things  would be the  easiest way  i guess  all right  so far  we got  i can't drive  55  from sammy  hagar  oh my god 
[03:34:00]  how about  another take  oh  he forgot  the lyrics  how about  another take  nothing ever  will man  did you hear that  he ran out of  steam singing  that line  this is horrible  i hear a little  poison in there  i wish there was a  little poison in  there  i want some  specific songs  though  we rocked the 80s 
[03:34:30]  like we thought  it would never  end  oh this is  we're back  and better  than ever  this is  this is  we're back  and better  than ever  we're back  give me a little 
[03:35:00]  taste of  we're back  why isn't  jimmy here  today  i know  it's the same  song  we're back  yeah  we've been  away for a  long long  long long  time  we've been  through changes  we've played  some games  the more  things change  the more  things stay  the same 
[03:35:30]  we're back  we're better than ever  we're back  together forever  that's a little jimmy's 
[03:36:00]  we're back  and the similarity  is amazing  we can still  we can still  bring the house  our lives  we did  way back  way  no you can't  maybe a smaller  room  a much smaller  room  yeah  we're back  we're back  we can  curse  we can  fight  we can  go all  night  still  tearing up  deep and  low  but it came 
[03:36:30]  and went  a long  long long  long  long  time  wow  it's like  d took  jimmy's song  and kind of  twisted it around  a little bit  well he is  twisted his  sister  so come on  they're also  saying motley  crew  girls girls  girls  skip the trucker  yeah  there's a little  girls girls  girls in there  and someone  is saying  they ripped  off the  guitar riff  from helmet  song  unsung  really  that's an  af song  and huh  oh wow  helmet  unsung  helmet 
[03:37:00]  no what  i don't even  understand what  you're just  saying  it's just  a rock  there was  some mumbling  in there  they're 25  they're playing  they're rocking  dude  not paying  attention  at 30  he's getting  closer  who cares  it's over  the hill  man we're  not even  thinking about  that  we're just  living 
[03:37:30]  25  yeah  then what  happens  it was a  rocked out  knocked out  sold out  joe  at the time  know that  know that  we were  too much  dreamin'  every night  we'd make  her sick  yeah  running through  the night  headed for  the promised  land  you know  where that is  where  well  vagina  is he talking  about vaginas  i don't know  we were rocking  it heading for  the promised  land which i think  is a girl's  vagina

[03:38:30]  bad  the music's  atrocious  sister of pain  from vince neil's  solo album  who is the fat  fuck  trying to  squeeze it  like d's  got the hair  and the makeup  on  like he's still  trying to  pull that off  d trying to  keep himself  in shape  and then  the other guy  looks like bob  buckman in  drag  yeah  who's the guy  all the way  to the left  though that is  just not  fitting in  his spandex  like he  used to  wow  surprise  not surprisingly  steve knows 
[03:39:00]  who he is  it's the  bass player  mark mendoza  it's mark  mendoza  it's mark  bulldozer  and that dude  looks like  paul stanley  that like  that guy  he looks like  paul stanley  over there  wow  jesus  see d was  so recognizable  that he could  go back  into that  makeup  and people  are like  alright  yeah  he's doing  the twisted  sister  thing  the rest  of the guys  look just  horrendous  they look  like trannies  there's a little  more  well d looks  a lot like  a tranny  there  yeah but  you know  the look

Rich.  Rich in Baltimore.  Rich.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, when Jimmy went long for him on the song, when he started doing, like, we used to go 
[03:42:30]  to Panama, we used to jump, and then we danced in the streets, and he was like, oh, wait,  that didn't rhyme.  It sounds exactly like when he says, you know where that is.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like, he threw that shit in.  It's the same song.  Jimmy is a genius.  It's scary.  Yeah.  He just...  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rich.  Someone says they'd rather hear Doyle Hargraves' band.  Happy birthday to Billy Bob Thornton, 54 years young today.  Wow.  Come on, Randy.

[03:51:30]  a lot of shit in the middle i like twisted sister all right what were some of the other bands at this  uh at this outdoor pavilion it was fucking l.a gun um it was slaughter extreme it was awful it was one  of those deals where you had to go because your chick wanted to go and you're just like please please  can i just can we go now please you realize how bad they are yes and oh and here's the other thing  about twisted sister d's the only one who came on in costume and kept in shape the other three are 
[03:52:00]  just fat messes of shit well because d had a career after the band he was taking you know keeping  himself in shape yeah those other guys just working around long island yeah just kind of  yeah all right thank you okay so i'm gonna say he's just making fun of himself  in that song stop it it's not being he's not being ironic no he's writing a song where everyone  could go wow yeah i remember when i was just like rocking out there i wasn't thinking about 
[03:52:30]  30 and then 30 came and i'm still rocking came and went yeah he wanted a long long long long long  long long time he definitely wants a hit there yeah uh sorry ain't gonna happen  this is the worst of the open anthony show mysterious xm i want to talk about sex let's talk about that  sex thing which sex thing jimmy's little problem yeah because that's a fucked up thing i mean we got 
[03:53:00]  people in the world that are married and then we have some people that are getting married and then  we have somebody who's probably never going to be married who gets to fuck his life away if he  chooses to no you're not jimmy that's got to be the worst addiction though man a sex addiction  because you gotta have because you gotta have the sex that is how do you fucking cure that you just  gotta you have to stop doing certain unhealthy things like fucking but then how do you get to 
[03:53:30]  the point that you're you're having healthy sex it's also a disconnection you're disconnected from  something is there a cure for sex addiction i really don't know do people get through it well  it's like food addictions i mean you do it but you just do it healthy that's all and you just know  when something's healthy when you're having healthy sex it's okay you just know it and the difference is  i'm jerking off online my dick's not even hard and i'm coming for the third time of the day you're at  the wrong website it must be the comfortable chairs in here i know us feels a lot more comfortable 
[03:54:00]  over here but you know what's weird is that there's there's guys that meet girls they like  them and they and you talk to them how's your sex life oh yeah we fuck like once a day or at least  four times a week and i'm like you fuck the same it's like wow and you got you like her it turns you  on like i told my girl i'm sorry but you don't it's like honey she gets mad because she wants to come  out in lingerie and and be sexy and she wants my dick to get hard it's like you have to make you have to 
[03:54:30]  if you want my dick hard and you want to fuck you have to come over grab my dick and fuck with it  it doesn't just stand up on fucking end like a fucking new 18 year old in fucking cleveland you  know what i mean it's it's you need to come over and it's like an old dog you rub its belly and  fucking jerk it off a little bit and i'll get hard and we'll be able to fuck but i and these guys who  fuck their i know friends of mine who have girlfriends and fuck them and it's like wow but all the time like 
[03:55:00]  but they're really into fucking their chick yeah and it's like there's something about sex that is  fucked up to me why aren't you into fucking your chick it's not that i'm not into fucking my chick  it's that i'm disconnected sex is a bad thing sex was i was taught sex in a fucked up way so it's it  represents bad to me so if i'm with somebody that i give a shit about it i don't want to do bad shit to  that person exactly i don't want to do shit bad shit to her i want to do i don't mind doing bad shit to 
[03:55:30]  some chick i meet in new brunswick that you know fuck her i don't give a shit like some some chick  that just wants to suck my cock fantastic my dick just goes wah i can't even fucking not have a hard  on around her but somebody you give a shit about it's like it's like fuck this is bad this is fucking  bad how the fuck do you get over that i don't know you gotta retrain yourself you got you have to go  back and find out those things that happened that made it exactly that made it bad but you also stop  acting out like uh like if you stop acting out like my dick has been all over the place lately 
[03:56:00]  because i'm not i mean occasionally i am jerking off but not nearly like what i was i would literally  go home after the show i would try to nap and i couldn't nap because i would jerk off and i  wouldn't stop jerking off until it was fucking like i would force myself to go to the gym and  then fucking and then uh work out and go to my spot and then you know jerk off again at night it  was awful dude during your awful i jerk in hotels on the road i have to jerk off every day but it  doesn't take you know it's different if you're jerking off healthy like if you just scrap a load 
[03:56:30]  you throw some lube on your dick and you're fucking pumping out all of yourself and take a nap  that's fine but if you're on craigslist for three hours humping down shemales  not that i do that no me neither but i mean you know if you're fucking shemales and you got  pre-com coming out for the whole three hours it's called edging yeah and then you and as soon as you  find one and you just just shoot it it comes out you feel nothing why don't you make yourself  why don't you just jerk off really fast and and maybe you can move on with other activities for  that day believe me right now that was jim norton in the mirror a thousand times i would love to know 
[03:57:00]  why i don't but what is that about it's escape it's it's numbing feelings my therapist told me  to numb your feelings you know when you jerk off in the mirror that's a sign of split personality  shut the fuck it is a sign of split personality if you jerk off in in the fucking mirror that's  creepy maybe you just like looking at yourself jerking off it's a listen to me i'm not a fucking  doctor but i know you're not dr gloss really wow it is it is i'm not even a fucking high school  student you're barely human it is something about you you don't feel and it's it sounds gay but you 
[03:57:30]  have to learn how to feel something no it's actually because you don't want to because you grow up with  so much fucking pain yeah with that you love whatever's happening that you learn how to uh do  things that make you not feel pain like i've jacked out of fucking uh uh websites and shit like that and  you know you spent a long time doing it you know you wait you wait you get right to the brink and 
[03:58:00]  stop yeah but you pay because it fucking feels good there's no deep dark fucking secret there  for some people it is that's what these guys are saying like a guy like you is a fucking amazing to  me because you're connected in a fucking different way you can you can jack off and then go fucking  pay your bills and fucking do shit but also and then you can go drink and buy guns so you have the  same thing but you have you fan it out okay i don't drink anymore i don't do drugs anymore i did 
[03:58:30]  quit smoking my eating is not bad so it all fucking comes out to my hand my nipples and my dick  all of it all of that self-hatred all that big thing just dumps out that way dumps out your cock  yeah all that need to escape that's your dick hole if i could fucking if i was eating cake till  fucking three in the morning or or drinking again like i would it wouldn't be as bad bobby kelly  well you know what no honest to god though i mean your food is it's just like sex because  you're on the fucking road and you don't want to you don't want to get a whore you don't want to 
[03:59:00]  fucking uh go to massage parlor you don't want to let some chick with fucking warts come into your  fucking room and and dry fucking boner so you're like fuck it you get a pizza and it actually same  for you it's it's gratification it's that quick fix it's the same with comedy it's not feeling  you don't want to feel it's not that you don't want to feel you want it is you want to feel you  want to feel quickly and you want to rush no it's that you don't want to feel anything  i was laughing at the boss finger pretzels  don't bite your finger get it they're real small 
[03:59:30]  he just has mustard on his fingernail yeah  i uh jimmy what are you doing we're having a serious discussion about your  he's gonna make a hand he's gonna make boss's hand out of the pretzels here's the thing  fucking visual about jokes on the radio here's the thing  well you got five little pretzels in your hand  he just did a chin joke  boss's hand yes of course very funny jimmy 
[04:00:00]  so jimmy you'd like uh where's this gonna go  i don't know i hope that i uh can stay away from it  let me swallow my pretzel because  it's fucking making my life miserable is it awful it looks like it's making it miserable though not doing it  no  can't you change your  your practices well yeah like like hope said you know just jack off  and shoot and then go about your business but yeah but i wasn't even jerking off when i was horny  i was just jerking off because yeah but it was something because that's the thing if you're horny and you're like fuck that i want to scrap a load 
[04:00:30]  that's healthy yeah you scrap a load no one cares i'm not saying i wouldn't do that  but i don't know how to do that like what i do is i wind up on craigslist just look at it ads  or i wind up on one of eight websites and it's fucking hours and it's fucking endless  well like off said just fucking jack off  yeah but it sounds like it doesn't doesn't it sounds like there's like an ocd thing  happen there too that's it i know what you mean but no i mean maybe because it's like you're it's like 
[04:01:00]  there's a tick it is about a stick and bobby's right so it is about feeling nothing and numbing yourself  and there's it is a quick fix in the sense that you're getting a rush it's that endorphin release  it's like a drug it's like let's be honest when a guy comes it says a major disappointment right after  you come it's like you go from a really really cool high to  poof let me tell you something you're just crashing hard and you gotta help them with our homework  jerking off jerking off is like a big hug it's like a hug from the dad you never had  it's just god i'm fucking lonely hug of well it was the same as when you like women jump up and 
[04:01:30]  start doing chores and they're like just happy after and stuff and guys there there's a massive  crash that happens but we're brought up on sex in a fucked up we're brought up with porn and and  magazines and fuck fuck fuck this bitch i fucked that bitch women have brought up the whole the the  opposite spectrum it's like find somebody you love and fucking romance and blah blah blah and  you don't want to fuck we're brought up fuck that bitch you fucked that bitch i fucked that  i mean so we're we're we're brought up in a fucked up way it's just it's just it and it sucks for us 
[04:02:00]  my wife because you never could do that's because you never had to be a balance made or else nothing  would get done in this world we'd all just be fucking or if it was the other way around uh human human  beings wouldn't exist yeah but then there's a there's a point there's a point in life though  when you meet a chick you like and all of a sudden you're supposed to be you're supposed to be like  them you're supposed to hey let's make love i you know what what what let's say hi to wendy the
