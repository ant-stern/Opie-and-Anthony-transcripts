<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a raucous recap of the previous day's broadcast, which famously featured professional wrestler Iron Sheik urinating in his pants on air.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, provided graphic details of the incident, including descriptions of the Sheik's genitalia and the resulting stain on his pants.  They discussed the online reaction, noting mentions in UK newspapers and numerous Google alerts, and debated whether the Sheik was aware of the urination, speculating about the role of excessive beer provided by his handlers.  They contrasted the Sheik's earlier subdued appearances with his recent, sexually explicit and vulgar behavior, repeatedly referring to the incident and associated photos as hilarious.  A caller added to the amusement, and the Sheik’s DVD was heavily promoted.

The show then transitioned to movie reviews with guest movie critic Kent.  Kent reviewed "The Wolverine," deeming it decent but not exceptional.  This led to a discussion of other films, including praise for "Star Trek" and panning of Matthew McConaughey's "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," a critique echoed by caller Brian, who also commented on discrepancies between early screeners and the final cut of "The Wolverine".  The hosts then discussed Kelly McGillis's coming out, sharing images and veering into explicit conversations about pornography, including a discussion about a Mexican porn star's body hair.  They reviewed other films, including a Bill Murray film they found boring. An "Iron Sheik/Christian Bale" audio remix was teased.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Iron Sheik incident, images of Mel Gibson's girlfriend, comments on Allie Lohan's appearance, and brief mentions of Joe Biden and the swine flu.  A segment analyzing the supposed gay subtext of *Top Gun* was also included.

A subsequent segment focused on two main themes: further reactions to the Iron Sheik interview, characterized by sexually explicit language, vulgar comments about Hulk Hogan, and a claim of showing his penis on camera; and the swine flu outbreak.  The hosts played clips from the wildly inappropriate interview, including a post-show interview further highlighting the Sheik's bizarre behavior. A listener requested and received a Christian Bale/Iron Sheik audio remix.  The swine flu discussion contrasted initial alarmist media coverage with the less severe US impact, referencing a conversation with Dr. Steve (a phone guest). A listener called in with an update on NYC swine flu cases, and another recounted a Dane Cook and Bob Kelly comedy show.  The segment concluded with a lengthy, humorous demo recording from Kenny, a co-host, for a disco DJ gig on Sirius XM's The Strobe channel, including inappropriate lyrics and commentary, interspersed with listener reactions.  Judah Friedlander and Shawn Stevenson were mentioned as upcoming guests.

The show continued with a discussion about Kenny's show intro music and the potential inclusion of hip hop, followed by a conversation about the upcoming end of David's internship, hindered by company liability and legal restrictions on unpaid internships.  The hosts lamented the changing radio culture and explored options for keeping David on as a daily guest.  They touched upon their inactive website, opiananthony.com, and their reliance on social media, while highlighting technical difficulties and friction between Kenny (in his dual role as security guard and show contributor) and management.  Judah Friedlander and motivational speaker Sean Stevenson ("a mess in a wheelchair") were announced as upcoming guests.  A segment featuring the Iron Sheik’s explicit and crude commentary on the Fabulous Moolah was previewed.

A significant portion was dedicated to playing and discussing clips of Mike Tyson's interviews discussing the Chris Brown-Rihanna incident, analyzing Tyson's comments, noting his apparent wisdom alongside accounts of his past violence against women.  The hosts discussed various Mike Tyson fights using numerous expletives.  Listener calls about the Mike Tyson movie were taken.  The segment concluded with "Kosher Sports" with intern David, featuring jokes about A-Rod, Hasidic hockey players, and the Kentucky Derby.  David's departure was discussed, including listener preference for former intern Pat Duffy. David stated his minimum wage theater job and desired $35,000 salary.  The segment ended with the hosts paying David with pennies and a brief, heated exchange with intern Evan.  Sean Stevenson was briefly introduced at the end.

A later segment featured Sean Stevenson, author of "Get Off Your Butt," a guest with osteogenesis imperfecta.  He discussed his condition, philosophy on overcoming adversity, and methods for personal growth.  He shared anecdotes, including throwing a first pitch lying down in the rain, and his goal of getting a television show.  The conversation covered etiquette with wheelchair users.  Calls from listeners "Jimmy" (about self-sabotaging behavior) and Vinny (about a breakup) led to Stevenson's advice on insecurity, scarcity mindset, coping mechanisms, and reframing negative experiences.  Other calls covered weight loss, faith, possessive girlfriends, and coping with the death of a child.  Opie and Anthony interjected with humor, noting Stevenson's abdominal muscles.  The segment concluded with advice and listener calls.

The final segment featured Sean Stevenson and his father.  A caller discussing the loss of his son prompted Stevenson to share experiences raising a son with brittle bone disease, including frequent injuries, hospital visits, and adaptation strategies.  The conversation broadened to life's challenges and the illusion of fairness, using a poker analogy.  Stevenson's father recounted harrowing incidents involving his son's injuries.  The conversation touched on adaptation, resilience, and mindset.  Fez (from the Ron and Fez Show) called in, discussing his therapy.  The hosts and Stevenson discussed internal vs. external factors influencing happiness, referencing studies.  Listener calls (including one incoherent call) were included. The segment concluded with promotion of Stevenson's book and website, and a humorous movie trailer parodying the Iron Sheik's on-air incontinence, which remained a recurring comedic element throughout the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning.  Hi!  Always starts with a good morning.  Very good, because it's the Big Friday, I like to say.  The Big Friday show.  The Big Friday show.  Yeah, there's just something about, you know, knowing that that weekend is here.  What's great about this radio show? 
[00:00:30]  We know we're going to start with good morning, and that's it.  We don't know what else is going to happen today.  That's how the show works.  Yesterday we started with a good morning, and it ended with a Hall of Fame wrestler peeing his pants.  I mean...  Peep pants!  We didn't have that penciled in for the show yesterday.  That's what I do! Peep pants!  Oh, God.  I, uh...  Boy, that kept me up.  That kept me up last night.  And just thinking of him pissing himself like that, that little spot got bigger and bigger 
[00:01:00]  and bigger in his little pants.  We, uh...  And this is after he pulled his junk out and shook it around, and it was just all ball bag  and a little peanut of a penis on top.  That's after he was bragging about his 10-inch cock.  And I would fuck him in the ass with my 10-inch cock.  And, uh...  No, not so much.  Not so much.  Maybe he'll make wee-wees on him.  I, uh...  I haven't laughed that hard in so long. 
[00:01:30]  It was just nonsense the last half hour.  And then there was pictures being taken, and one picture wasn't good enough, and then we  had to march back in and take more pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I think he knew he was peeing his pants, and he just doesn't give a shit.  You think so?  You think he was just completely clueless to the fact that he was wedding himself?  And incontinent.  Oh, incontinent.  Yes, that's what it's called, being incontinent.  Well, I, uh...  I looked at some of the, uh... 
[00:02:00]  Google alerts.  Wow, a lot of Google alerts.  That came in.  It's about time we're back on the Google alert.  Google.  But it's, uh...  It's for a weird one.  A little Googling.  Iron Sheik pees his pants on the Opie and Anthony show.  Iron Sheik.  Google alert.  Google alert.  World Wrestle Federation PP champion.  Champ win.  I'm the greatest PP champion from Terran, where we all make PP. 
[00:02:30]  Well, he's been saying my name wrong for years.  Now I know why.  He says Opie.  Opie.  But he's not saying Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Yeah, it made the wrestling news and gossip in the, uh, UK on...  In the Sun, which is their big, you know...  We're in the UK today.  In the paper, yes.  A little UK coverage?  A little UK coverage.  What is the UK coverage saying?  In England, I think they got... 
[00:03:00]  Let's see if this has legs as far as, um...  Trying to blame us for things.  Okay.  Uh, I'm finding it.  Funny.  Scanning.  Scanning my, uh...  On my iPhone, by the way.  Yeah, my iPhone goes to England.  Uh, here it is.  The Iron Sheik 66 on the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, we will have a report in the next newsletter.  But on, uh, the show, they...  It says they fed Sheik several beers. 
[00:03:30]  And he pissed his pants live on the air.  Really sad situation.  Really sad situation.  Sad for who?  We didn't feed him beers, though.  He...  It was his peeps.  Uh...  Dude.  His handlers?  I know.  They kept handing him beers.  Oh, yeah.  Well, uh, we found a six-pack of Becks.  Yeah, what are you gonna do?  I mean, his handlers were...  I love the Becks.  Feeding the Sheik.  He's a grown man, you know?  He can do what he wants.  You think you can keep up with the Sheik as far as drinking goes? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, without pissing myself, either.  I'll shit myself, but I won't pee.  I think he did eight beers in an hour, Ant.  For real.  All right.  Yeah, that's not bad.  That's pretty impressive.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good?  And he's 66 years old.  That's an animal.  67, he kept saying.  67.  They put him at 66.  I don't think a year makes much of a difference when you're pissing yourself.  That's true.  He's an animal.  But, yeah, getting some nice headlines today.  Oh, yeah.  You know something? 
[00:04:30]  Last time he was on, it was all just wrestling, and he was a little more politically correct  as far as I'm talking about some of his adversaries.  Well, he didn't really talk about anything the last time he was on our show.  What are you talking about?  No, I know.  He just kept reciting the same thing about being a chaplain.  Chaplain.  Pleasure for me.  Pleasure for me.  Madison Square Garden and opening the knee and Anthony, Anthony, and opening the money.  WrestleMania, I was greatest wrestle, greatest in the world. 
[00:05:00]  And now it's like, fuck him in the ass!  With his gravelly fucking voice and his pee-pee pants.  We're getting some highlights from the Irish Seeks performance.  Highlights?  That's the whole friggin' clip.  Every second he was in here was a highlight.  I want to hear him talking about Pussy again.  I want to hear him talking about The Ultimate Warrior.  I want to hear him talking about Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  And Brooke Hogan. 
[00:05:30]  So the boys are working on some highlights just in case you missed it.  Hopefully we replay the entire hour with the Iron Sheik over the weekend because it was just amazing.  Oh, please.  It was just amazing.  And the picture of me, you, and Jimmy with me pointing at the pee spot and you're just having a good time.  You're trying to actually be in the picture without touching them but making it look like we're all chums, if that makes sense.  I leaned backwards as far as I could because I didn't want the smell of his urine wafting up on me. 
[00:06:00]  So I'm standing there and my feet were pretty much like even with where his feet was, but my head was about two feet back.  I was defying gravity with the way I was leaning backwards.  Jimmy looks ridiculous with the belt.  He's having fun with the belt.  The pee-pee belt.  My head's on the...  I wrote yesterday that it could be the greatest picture ever taken of us three in studio.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  And so many people got a hold of me yesterday and they're like, you've got to give us a better, a larger print of that.  So they all want to make it their...  Better resolution.  They want to make it their background on their computers badly.  How do we get that done?  What did you take it with?  It was just with the, you know, regular digital camera.  I didn't take that picture.  That's good enough.  Oh, it was a good camera, though?  It was a regular one?  Yeah, I actually got to give E-Rock credit.  He was the one who took the two pictures that I've been showing off on my Twitter.  Oh, upload that.  Upload that bitch-slack photo bucket or some shit. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, let's do that today because I can't believe how many people just writing saying, I need a better quality version of that picture.  Full resolution where you're just making your giant screen on your...  Making your desktop.  Because there's so much going on in that picture.  Oh, yeah.  There's just so...  It's not just about the P-spot.  No.  It's us laughing and trying to get away from the P-spot.  You acknowledging it.  Me repulsed by it.  And Jimmy just being a little silly goose. 
[00:07:30]  Dude, that is a picture I honestly would like to blow up and have on my wall.  It should be in the studio.  We have to have that blown up.  Put it on a disc and give it to Eric.  And he'll figure out how to put it up and let people download it at high resolution.  That's a great photo.  It's fantastic.  I can't even think of a picture that comes close to that one.  And we've had some stars in this studio, but that one, it's already on the glass.  Oh, no.  They put the other one on our glass wall outside our office.  The one where he's just sitting there in the P-spot. 
[00:08:00]  Because someone's like, you think he just spilled a beer on himself?  I'm like, no.  Jimmy was basically watching the P-spot grow.  It was growing bigger and bigger.  And I didn't even want to believe that he was pissing himself.  Oh, I got 10 photos of his cop.  Sorry.  So I didn't want to believe it.  So I'm thinking, all right, maybe the beer bottle was, you know, condensing in his lap.  Maybe.  And then I had asked to have the lights turned on because you couldn't even see him over there in the corner.  And then I thought it was the shadow of the big microphone bulb, the big windscreen that was like right down there. 
[00:08:30]  But then I realized, no, it's a little too dark for a shadow.  Look at him sitting here.  This is a little Gaussian blur.  Yeah.  I was at the crotch.  Dude, he's got an ultra close-up.  That's nice.  Yeah.  The camera's nice.  It's good.  I drove out to Huntington yesterday.  I'm by myself driving, just laughing like a complete lunatic every time I thought about behind chic.  Oh, yeah.  And then someone pointed out that Tyra's in our picture and she looks disgusted. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, all the background stuff that's going on.  There is a lot going on in that picture.  Yeah, so who are we giving this job to?  E-Rock?  E-Rock, because once you put it on a disc in a high resolution, then you can give it out.  Because I want a copy for myself.  Yeah, I want it framed in the studio.  I want it on my computers at home.  I want to put it on my little wall of fame I got at my house.  And I have to say, I'm wearing my hat in that picture.  People were commenting going, oh my god, Anthony, the hair looks terrible. 
[00:09:30]  What did you do?  I'm leaning back so far that the brim of my hat is completely level with the top of the hat.  So it looks like I have this bowl, retard, moe, mongoloid fucking Pete Rose hairdo.  People were like, wow, his hair plugs are coming in really bad.  Plugs.  They're follicles.  I want to see the pictures.  There's a way to bring it up.  Oh, I know. 
[00:10:00]  There's got to be a way to bring it up so we can enjoy it for a moment.  This picture is everywhere today.  Yeah.  I mean, in the wrestling world, this is the big story today.  Yeah, there were a couple of-  Our interview with the Iron Sheik and him being his face.  Yep.  There were a couple of Google alerts from wrestling websites and stuff just unbelievably sad, they said.  It's not sad.  The guy is loving his life.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't give a shit. 
[00:10:30]  He's a man.  It's like the way we victimized a young boy.  He's an adult.  It's fantastic.  He's got two piss spots, by the way.  I know.  One by the tip of his wee-wee and one by his big ball sack.  His ball sack probably soaked in the urine and then made a urine press on his face.  What a fruit I look like.  Everyone's face is hysterical.  I couldn't be further away or further back from the Sheik. 
[00:11:00]  I didn't want to touch him.  So I got the one hand up in the, yeah!  And he was going, number one!  And I was like, yes, you are number one.  You are going number one.  Yes, you are going number one.  Oh my God.  I love when he comes on our show.  I could not pull my pants.  Someone said I was floating in the background like David Blaine because I did not want to  be next to him and smell that piss wafting up.  Dude, the man pissed his pants.  He pissed his pants. 
[00:11:30]  He didn't give a shit.  He was heavyweight champion of the wrestling world.  And he tickled himself.  He was the champion.  Let me say hi to George and PA.  The phone's just lit.  George.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys, I'm a fairly new listener and I'm hooked on you  guys, man.  You guys are the best.  But I've never laughed so hard in my life.  That's what you guys keep saying.  You watch the pee spot grow, man.  I lose it, man.  You guys are great, man.  It all of a sudden became like you were in the cafeteria in elementary school and someone 
[00:12:00]  was pissing themselves.  And you're just like, they pissed themselves.  It was the same thing.  And that might not have been the highlight of the whole, I guess it has to be the highlight  of his appearance.  Oh, that was the capper.  But the shit he was saying.  The shit he was saying.  Actually, his balls.  He just waved his balls around.  He's all balls.  And his dick was along for the ride.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know where we could post that one.  Well, by the way, the Iron Sheep was promoting his DVD.  Oh, that's right.  And he said, we promised that he'd show his dick. 
[00:12:30]  We'd promote his DVD.  Well, he did.  And we are.  Yeah.  The DVD roast.  You can go to us.  I forgot a week ago.  It's a weird website.  Yeah, what's it called?  Find it out.  We've got to give him a solid plug.  His dick got all nervous and threw up, though, from being out.  Yeah, his penis is not used to the exposure.  His penis is very shy.  He got nervous.  His ball bag is pretty impressive.  He's got a giant bag.  He's got a giant bag.  But two huge balls.  He doesn't even have an old man sack.  Camel balls he has.  And a little nub on top, resting on top. 
[00:13:00]  Allegedly a penis.  My photo is him sitting here.  I have a photo with him.  And you can see the piece part is small.  It gets bigger.  It's great.  Oh, good.  You should do a little time-lapse thing.  A morph.  Jimmy, like, he was talking about his 10-inch cock so much, I knew.  I looked at Jimmy like, you want to see it, too.  Dude, I was staring at the groin the whole time.  You want to see it just as bad as I do.  And then, man, you want to talk about disappointment.  When you're talking about a 10-inch cock, you're expecting to see something good.  Oh, you better have some meat going. 
[00:13:30]  It was a little nub of a pinky on top of giant balls.  What do you think his handlers were thinking?  Because they knew we were laughing.  They love all that shit.  Because he pissed himself.  They know exactly what they're doing.  They love that shit.  Is it ringroast.com?  Okay, you can get the Iron Sheik's roast.  I would suggest grabbing it.  Oh, please.  Please.  If you had a good time yesterday listening to the show and you got a few extra bucks laying  around, just pick up his DVD.  Support the guy.  He's broke.  He is broke. 
[00:14:00]  And he uses his pants as a toilet.  And he's a nice man.  I watched a video of him slapping his handler in the face.  I'd never seen that.  It's great.  Oh, he's a fucking, he's an angry dude.  Yeah, gave it to him.  He gave him one.  Like I said, pleasure for me to come back again to Manhattan from Tehran, Iran, to the Madison  Steregarden, New York, number one radio station in the world.  Anthony and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and I want to say thanks to the Jesus or Muhammad or Allah to have come to the most famous city in the world. 
[00:14:30]  Like Ferdinand said, the city never rests.  The city is up all the time. 
[00:15:00]  Manhattan, Madison Steregarden, New York, and especially Opie and Anthony, radio station.  I love all my wrestling fans and I love all radio station people wrestling.  Anthony and Opie, Opie and Opie show.  Number one in the world, from A to the Z. If you cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere.  Like Frank Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  You cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere. 
[00:15:30]  God bless Frank Sinatra.  My Italian person, he used to come watch my match in the garden and he was the real, real singer and hot class and part mafia.  God bless you and part the mafia.  I got something better, actually.  But he fucked up.  He said the total opposite.  I know.  You're supposed to say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere because it's the toughest place to make it.  He said if you can't make it in New York, you can't make it anywhere.  He gave the polar opposite meaning of what that expression means. 
[00:16:00]  He completely said the opposite thing.  Ten inch, my cock.  Ten inch, my cock.  Ten inch, my cock, and then he pulled it out and, oh, my goodness.  He was off by ten inches.  Oh, Big Jack.  Oh.  We literally have 40 Iron Sheik drops.  We don't know what to do with them yet.  They're great.  I'm in.  Tell him. 
[00:16:30]  We have five Iron Sheik videos on YouTube.  Oh, my gosh.  The ball shake one, of course, couldn't make it up.  No.  No.  That's got to be a joke.  But you own it, right?  Well, yeah, but I already got an email from his manager requesting that the video of the  Iron Sheik shaking his balls around not be posted because I got to I talked to him afterwards  and that was that was officially the first time he's taken it out.  Oh, well, interview.  We got a privilege.  First time. 
[00:17:00]  Well, you know what?  If that was posted, everybody that he said he was going to fuck up the ass with his ten inch  dick could come back and just go like, well, no.  I mean, you said it, but it wouldn't even be gay if you took that thing in your ass.  No.  It's not gay if it doesn't break the cheeks.  If it doesn't touch the sides.  Zombie cheap juice, son of a bitch.  That's funny.  You got a nice long clip.  Of what?  Of the Sheik.  Not really.  Why?  What are you doing?  I just want to hear the Sheik. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah, I do, actually.  I see what you're doing.  Let's play a little Sheik.  Okay.  Wait.  Hold on a minute.  Wait a minute.  I could just play the one we just.  Yeah, why don't you play that one?  Let me see what I got.  Hold on.  30 seconds.  Good.  Yeah.  That's good.  And like I say again, I want to say hello to all my intelligent Opie and Anthony show.  And I want to say everywhere I go in America, people tell me, Sheik, you are on the killer  comedian, the best. 
[00:18:00]  I think it's a great feeling for me.  To anywhere I go, people talk about it.  God bless all my wrestling fans.  And also Anthony and Opie.  Opie and Anthony, Roger Station.  God bless you guys.  I'm not going to talk no more.  And have a good day.  You're such idiots.  How old are we?  No.  It's amazing how. 
[00:18:30]  How old are we?  It's just a man tangled on himself.  I know.  And it's the highlight of our time here so far.  Why is that?  Because we're idiots.  We're off to a good start in this new building.  We also know how his pants feel.  Yes.  I'm working here.  I don't want to see his ass.  I don't want to see his fucking cock.  That's great.  That's a good clip.  I'd like to eat the pussy.  Otherwise, I'll fuck her ass.  I forgot that one. 
[00:19:00]  What a fucking ringer telling that ring phone that is.  Oh, shit.  Exactly.  Oh, you can make some friggin' phone calls with these, huh?  No kidding.  Who can we call it?  Great soundboard this would make.  We got to call someone and do this today.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  One more for now.  We got...  Who is this?  The Iron Sheik.  You could really cut those up and make great fucking phone calls with them.  We got 41.  I'll play one more for now, and then throughout the rest of the morning, we'll do the rest 
[00:19:30]  of them.  Fuck or fucking bitch pussy!  Yes, Danny?  Oh, I'm sorry.  We should just go through the phone book and find somebody with the last name of Hogan.  Oh, shit!  Hogan, you'll get fucking the ass!  Hogan, you'll get fucking the ass!  Fantastic.  That's a great picture. 
[00:20:00]  Anthony's clip was too low in the mix, barely audible.  Oh, well.  What?  I made some pee-pee.  Yeah, we'll do it again.  I was making pee-pee in a bowl.  I thought it was loud and clear.  Yeah.  I heard it.  A lot of people wanted to...  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Steve in Philly.  Steve, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hey.  Hey, we need to take those and turn them into the ringtones, because I need to get  into my cock on my phone.  Yeah, we're going to do...  We'll get some of those clips up somewhere.  We'll let you know.  And we're also going to get the pee picture up, so everyone could have fun with that as 
[00:20:30]  well.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Oh, no.  God damn it.  Oh, he totally nailed you on that one.  Yes, he did.  Steven, PA.  Steve.  Hey, I was listening to the show earlier.  One of the recaps from yesterday.  The website you're looking for is ringroast.com.  Did we say that?  Yeah, I did say that.  Yeah, he found it.  All right.  It's good we say it again, though.  Ringroast.com to get the Iron Sheik Roast DVD.  We played a few clips from that before he came in here, and it looked like it's a good  little thing. 
[00:21:00]  It's a double DVD set, which is always cool, yeah.  We're going to change gears slightly.  We've got Kent, the movie guy, on the phone to give us his review of The Wolverine, which  is opening today.  What?  Opening Friday-wide?  It's opening Friday-wide.  Opens Friday-wide?  Okay.  Yeah.  I just got back from the midnight screening, and fans were disappointed, to say the least.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  What's interesting is I've been reading a lot of critics' takes on the film, and they're 
[00:21:30]  all saying it's better than the last X-Men movie, but they're all still giving it one  or two stars.  I like the last X-Men movie.  That wasn't that bad.  So if you like the last X-Men movie, this one is, it's not great.  It's not like Iron Man good, or it's not the Dark Knight good, but it's a pretty good  summer action film.  It's a pretty decent way to start off your summer lineup.  One star in the post.  Kent, you're confusing the hell out of a lot of people, because the New York paper's  giving it one star.  Most of the movie critics across the country, you know, trash it. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, they're giving it bad reviews, but a lot of them are still saying it's better  than the last film.  But they gave the last film is a fresh tomato on Rotten Tomatoes.  It's around 60%.  So I think overall, I think we're kind of spoiled as a country when it comes to comic book movies.  We expect a lot more, especially after the past few films we've gotten.  Last year was just killer.  I mean, the Incredible Hulk was great.  Iron Man was great.  And the Dark Knight, of course, second highest grossing film of all time.  And now you get this Wolverine movie. 
[00:22:30]  It's not terrible, but it's totally watchable.  I didn't like, in the trailer, the fact that his little claws there don't look as good as  they did in the other movies.  You know what?  That, in the trailer, that's, from what I saw, was a pre-render.  Last night, they look better than they do in the trailer.  Yeah, they don't move around on his knuckles.  They put a lot of money into it.  Was he running around chopping things up and dicing things with his new clothes? 
[00:23:00]  What was he doing?  Yes, he absolutely was.  And I've got to say, the last 20 minutes of that film is pretty kick-ass.  What musical number is he singing?  What fruity friggin' Broadway show tune is he?  Is he doing his no-business, like, show business with his fucking claws above his head?  What is that?  Okay, porno.  I don't know.  Oh, all right.  But, I mean, it's a good matinee film.  I wouldn't spend full price, by any means. 
[00:23:30]  But it's a pretty good afternoon matinee.  I'd say catch it on, like, Tuesday or Wednesday in the afternoon.  But it's not something you want to rush out to see right away.  Next week, though, Star Trek is coming out.  I have seen that.  And that is a better-than-sex movie, fantastic film.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that looks great.  That movie is amazing.  It doesn't matter how into Star Trek you are.  That is a perfect science fiction film.  Saw that little clip they played on during Lost, 
[00:24:00]  which was pretty cool of young Kirk running away from some type of monster.  And it looked a lot better than any of the monsters from the original series, I must say.  Absolutely.  It is a fantastic film.  So, if you're on a budget and you're trying to figure out which films to see this summer,  I'd say wait for Star Trek.  That's the pinnacle of a summer movie.  It is great.  That's going to be the movie?  That's going to be the movie.  A lot of people are shocked by how fantastic it is. 
[00:24:30]  I was looking at all the movies coming out today.  They're all clunkers.  They're all getting one, two stars today.  What else is out today?  I didn't hear anything.  Well, I mean, for the chicks, the Matthew McConaughey.  Ghosts of Girlfriends.  Oh, that movie is like that Matthew McConaughey.  He fucking is terrible.  How the fuck do you get to continue doing movies in Hollywood  if you have a bomb after a bomb after a bomb after a bomb?  Those movies do extremely well on DVD.  Chicks eat those movies up.  But that's, oh, girls, let's all get together 
[00:25:00]  and rent the new Matthew McConaughey film.  You just don't expect those to do well.  What's the name of his latest unwatchable hunk of shit?  It's Girlfriends of, or something Girlfriends of Past.  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.  That sounds like it could be great.  It means they all died.  You're a jerk off to that one.  Brian is going to join the conversation here, Kent.  Brian in Jersey, what do you got to add to this?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Yo, guys, I think a lot of it's bullshit about the X-Men movie.  I think it's going to be a great fucking movie. 
[00:25:30]  About a month ago, they released a screener's copy,  and it somehow got out,  and everybody started watching this unedited,  effects not even done version of the movie  and started passing a sheet of reviews on it.  Actually reviewing, yeah, a screener copy that wasn't done.  Wasn't completely done.  Yeah, CNN actually interviewed me about that.  I came into your guys' studio the day after.  Right.  That's when I came and gave you guys those Blu-rays.  Yeah, that version, it's okay, you know. 
[00:26:00]  If you're reviewing a screener copy,  it's not a final version.  There's about 14 minutes in this film that isn't in that version,  and it's okay, but it's not great.  It's not as good as the other X-Men movies, really,  and it's not, you know, as good as, like, the Spider-Man films  or Iron Man or The Dark Knight.  You know what?  And I never saw the X-Men movies.  They're pretty good.  I like them.  I like them a lot, but it's one of those deals where, like,  you know, you focus on one, you know, Wolverine or something, 
[00:26:30]  for the most part.  I don't know.  They kind of did that in two a little bit.  Yeah, this film, I will say the story in this movie  makes the story in two better.  But this film, you kind of just want a fan that cut it up  and put this film as flashbacks into two.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not really, it doesn't stand on its own.  Yeah, why put him in his own movie?  Just make another X-Men movie and kind of, you know,  concentrate a little bit on him.  The biggest problem with it is it's a prequel.  You know exactly who lives and who dies.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, you introduce a young Cyclops. 
[00:27:00]  Well, we know what's going to happen.  That's kind of cool.  So is Star Trek, though.  Think about that.  You know, Spock isn't going to die in that one, or Kirk.  No matter what happens, Kirk's running around.  There's this giant fucking monster chasing him.  And you're like, he's not going to die.  Well, that's the interesting thing about this new Star Trek offshoot is  they're taking the, there's time travel involved.  And they're going with the Back to the Future alternate 1985 route.  Oh, good.  So Spock comes back into the past with Romulans. 
[00:27:30]  And because of that.  Don't ruin it.  Yeah, really.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  I didn't know that.  So shut up.  What did you know?  I told you guys that when I was there.  I don't care.  I forgot.  Don't tell me anything.  All right.  I'm just saying it allows you to go and say the original continuity is there.  But now we have this whole new thing.  We can do a whole bunch of new stuff, which is pretty cool.  Where does Biff Tanner come in?  About 35 minutes in.  Right.  All right.  Ken, thank you so much. 
[00:28:00]  Thank you, guys.  So I don't know if we're supposed to see Wolverine or not by one star in the Daily News.  Not that that means anything.  Matinee.  I said, see it as a matinee.  Matinee.  This is great.  Thank you, Ken.  Who gave Kent the title movie guy?  And then someone goes, um, Kent did.  All right.  Hey, someone is suggesting.  Where is it?  People are saying.  People are saying.  Where the fuck is it?  Oh, okay. 
[00:28:30]  From somebody's Blackberry.  So I don't know who wrote this.  But it says, you guys need to do an Iron Sheik Christian Bale remix.  Now, the Christian Bale thing kind of fading out a little bit.  Of course.  But maybe before we say goodbye to that for good, maybe we do an Iron Sheik Christian Bale remix.  Bring it to life with them yelling at each other.  That could be good.  Because there's a lot of insults in these drops.  Oh, my God.  So maybe the guys down the hall can maybe throw something.  I would make a good argument, those two.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Give it a try.  Give it a try.  Speaking of movies, really quick, we can get this out of the way and then maybe take our first break. 
[00:29:00]  No surprise here, but Kelly McGillis from Top Gun.  Might remember her.  She was almost sexy.  Yeah.  She was, like I said, a little too blocky.  She had very broad shoulders.  Kind of a fishy face.  I don't know.  Yeah, they really gussied her up.  They gave her some 80s hair.  Yep.  Well, she has finally admitted that she is now a lesbian. 
[00:29:30]  She likes the muff.  I'm done with the man thing.  I did that.  I need to move on in life.  Yeah.  That's another part of being true to yourself.  I think it's been a challenge for me, personally.  Really?  She couldn't look more like a dyke if she tried, by the way.  Oh, she butched herself up.  If you Google, do a little Google image search on her.  You're not going to believe.  And see what she looks like now.  You won't believe it's her.  You won't believe it's the same person.  Yeah.  She has complete gray hair, which, whatever.  She's older. 
[00:30:00]  But all short.  All short and dykey.  And this is Kelly McGillis.  Well, that's a good picture.  It's actually a good picture.  Go to, I think, was it, whatwithtylerderdendo.com had the latest one?  I forgot where I was yesterday.  But that's a gussied up picture.  You've got to see her just all natural.  All natural.  She looks like an old.  An old dyke.  Old high school gym teacher.  She is.  Yeah.  She looks like an old dyke.  Wow.  Which one's her?  Wait a minute.  Whoa, what is that?  It's her being gay in a movie. 
[00:30:30]  Holy shit.  Which one is she?  She's the one with her head in the lap.  Yeah.  Oh, she's got the nice boobies.  Nice boobies.  It's called a monkey's mask.  Oh, it is.  God bless.  Is that because she looks like she's wearing a monkey's mask with a big bush in her face?  God bless Mr. Skin.  She's been naked a lot.  Yeah, she is, huh?  Wow.  She had some nice breast implants.  You guys see the one that they posted yesterday.  Whatever.  Uh, all right.  This fucking movie poster for this Matthew McConaughey film is making my stomach hurt. 
[00:31:00]  Let me see it, Jimmy.  I heard you whispered under your breath.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong with it?  What's wrong with it?  It's the typical...  Oh, it's awful.  Yeah, give it a little description.  Yeah.  He's standing there.  Him and Jennifer Garner are back to back.  Yes, that's used, by the way, in so many movies.  And he has a scarf on, and it's wrapped, like, over his shoulder, but it goes over her breast,  back to back.  Yeah.  And she's tugging on it, and just kind of holding it, and they're both kind of looking 
[00:31:30]  at the camera, smiling.  Fucking assholes.  Ugh.  It's awful.  We, uh, uh, we watched...  Oh, Jesus.  We watched the trailer.  Me and Danny watched the trailer, and I felt gay after I watched it.  Why?  It was so incredibly bad.  The trailer was, like, the typical, you know, when you find love.  With the voice and everything.  And the music, you know.  Was it climbing up on Salisbury Hill in the background?  Yeah, yeah, one of those. 
[00:32:00]  It really was.  Just awful.  Can we get the trailer of this movie?  We'll get it.  All right, good.  Is Kelly McGillis really in the armed services?  Well, yeah, we finally found the picture, and it was whatwouldtylerderndu.com, www.tdd.com.  Way better than Perez Hilton, because he doesn't make it about himself.  Go there for your celebrity gossip.  Uh, yeah, look at that picture of Kelly McGillis.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  She's reporting.  She's reporting for lesbian duty.  For duty, yeah.  Nice.  She looks like John Kerry in that fucking long horse face. 
[00:32:30]  Horrible.  She looks like the general from The Fifth Element.  It's amazing.  It's the same broad.  I know.  I know there's an age thing that happened, but you barely, you would, you would lose money.  You would have banged her there in the left.  Absolutely.  The picture on the left.  Can't even question it.  The picture on the right.  There's no question.  You wouldn't even fucking give her a second look.  Stop it.  I want to see if the breast implants held up.  Oh, please.  Danny, would you?  Uh, I think I'd have to see the rest of it. 
[00:33:00]  There is no way.  Look at it.  She's frigging.  Man, some of these broads that have the old looking face, you take the clothes off and  they, they still have youth on their side.  Yeah, man.  And look, every internet website loves putting up the worst picture possible.  Right.  So you got to take it with a good point.  God bless you, Danny, that you still might be in there.  Ugh.  Maybe, right?  She wouldn't.  Like I said, I got to see the rest of what's going on.  It's, it's tough to make a call when she's wearing a beret and a fucking army uniform. 
[00:33:30]  General's uniform or something.  What?  I'm the only one that has been surprised after you take the clothes off of grandma and say,  wow, look at the body.  It doesn't match the face.  I don't understand what the military picture is that she's in.  Maybe we can try to figure that out.  Like, is it, is it her name on there?  Is it, she's doing a part in a movie?  Is she, I don't know.  I have no idea.  The medal, the medal's for eating bush above and beyond the Call of Duty.  I got a, I got a question for Jimmy, actually. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  I love when I get to drive my car because then I get to check out all the channels on SiriusXM.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I landed on the Playboy channel.  Okay.  Which I, I, I'll be honest, I thought it was a, it was a garbage channel.  When I first heard that Playboy was, you know, doing a channel for satellite radio, I'm like,  what could they possibly do after, after they moan?  Right, right.  But it kept my interest big time.  And they were discussing, I think it was night calls, and they were discussing a porn star 
[00:34:30]  who's, uh, making her name in the business because she allows her bush to grow in really  hairy, not just a little bit.  Interesting.  Like, this is her whole gimmick in the porn industry that she allows her bush to be ridiculously  hairy.  Does she have herpes on her?  Covering up a world of herpes.  I know someone that said that porn girls would let their pussy grow in when they're having  an outbreak, a lot of them would let it grow in.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think it's what's happening in the porn industry.  There's so many hot girls doing porn that to make your name, you've got to come up with  some kind of gimmick, and her gimmick, I think she's from Mexico, too, which helps the situation. 
[00:35:00]  And she's not trimming the sides or anything.  She is letting this thing just go.  Letting her freak flag fly.  And I didn't catch the name because I wanted to Google image her today for our show.  You should just Google it.  Do you know?  No, you should Google what you just wrote, Mexican porn star hairy pussy, because it  might come up.  I don't know.  Right.  But again, it's like she's probably one of those girls that has a naturally hairy bush who  like under any, like most girls that are growing, it might just be a regular  hairy vagina.  Yeah, yeah.  But hers, she probably gets it down the legs. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, they don't want to go around to the asshole.  But they're talking like she's not shy to let it completely grow in, and she's making  a name because she's doing this.  It's so awful.  And it made me go, fuck, I've got to see pictures of this girl.  The Playboy, I did an interview with them when I was in LA, and their morning show was  actually, they're actually cool guys, and you know, the show was good that I was on.  Another movie, by the way, that's no good, The Limits of Control, another fucking boring  Bill Murray, heap of shit.  What is he doing now?  Enough.  Can you read the synopsis of the Bill Murray movie?  Because I saw, I saw the photo of Bill Murray, and I'm like, he's got a new movie out, cool. 
[00:36:00]  Because I try to search out Bill Murray movies.  It probably bores me to tears.  I would never, never.  Any movie I've seen of his recently stinks.  It stinks.  I don't like it.  The Limits of Control, a hitman conducts a methodical business in Spain.  If ever a title was on the money, it's this one.  It is, of course, part of a tightly constructed meta joke by director Jim Jarmusch, who has  been great before and is always capable of highly distinctive deadpan beauty.  Yet, where once that quality was a virtue in this movie, it's a vice, a nameless hitman 
[00:36:30]  travels through Spain meeting odd characters who sit with him, ask similar questions, and move  a bit closer to resolving an inconsequential mystery.  Tilda Swinton shows up as a playful lady in white.  Gail Garcia Bernal, a hippie cow dude.  Paz de la Horta, a constantly naked temptress, and Bill Murray, a crucial puzzle piece.  Limits feel like it's slow motion, fulfilling Jarmusch's test of how immobile a film can get  before it stops existing. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  Another boring clunker by that part.  Damn it.  Can I be honest?  Sure.  I just started hearing white noise about 20 seconds ago.  That's all I heard, Jim.  I'm not even joking.  I was with you, and then I just watched myself just fade out.  That just sounds awful.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Is there a Michelle Obama comic book?  Is that what I'm seeing on CNN?  We'll find out.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be looked into.  And that picture, by the way, of the...  What is that?  That's General Monroe from The Fifth Element.  From The Fifth Element, and Kelly McGill is his hysteria. 
[00:37:30]  He also played Kehoe in 48 Hours, by the way.  That's the guy.  I forgot who it was.  Uh, well, the picture of Kelly McGill is from The L Word, I guess.  I guess she was starred in The L Word.  Oh, did she?  What was it?  Showtime?  Yeah.  So that's where that picture came from.  And when can we get the, um...  When can we get the Ghost of Girlfriends past...  I want to hear that trailer when we come back.  Oh, you've got to hear the trailer.  Horrendous.  You've got to hear the trailer audio.  It's horrible.  Yeah, we will.  It's fucking got to be awful.  We absolutely will do that. 
[00:38:00]  It's so unfunny.  So uninteresting.  Ugh.  All right.  It's like a Matthew McConaughey trying to be charming.  He tags in everything.  We're going to do the Christian Bale, Iron Sheik remix.  Pleasure.  Pleasure for me.  We'll do the trailer of that movie.  We've got to get into the swine flu stuff again today.  Joe Biden.  What did I tell you about this guy?  He's a retard.  He is a retard.  They trudge him out every few months and he says something stupid.  And then they go, all right. 
[00:38:30]  Back, back.  All right.  Back in your office.  Back in the basement.  Shut up.  He is really incompetent, that guy.  Son of a boob.  Ugh.  Yeah, we'll talk about that next.  It's food time.  Opie and Anthony.  More montages.  Top Gun, yes.  One of the greatest montages ever, probably.  That is the gayest movie ever fucking made.  Under the guise of not being gay.  Of being manly.  Right.  It was fighter jet pilots.  Why would you play this and not?  Danger zone.  On a carrier. 
[00:39:00]  On a carrier.  Oh, Folly Wall Street.  Wow.  And all that stuff was supposed to hide the gay undertones.  The complete gayness.  Somebody recut.  They took all of the most gay portions of this movie and just put it together into like four minutes.  It's the whole movie.  It's everything but the planes.  Everything but the credits and the gaffers.  There really is a lot of parts to this movie where you're just like, what the hell?  Top Gun homosexuality.  Hey, uh.  What is that, Quentin?  Yeah, he starts off, the video that I was talking about starts off with him explaining 
[00:39:30]  why Top Gun is the gayest movie of all time.  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  What's the film about?  What's it really about?  What genre does it take?  What, what, like a, like a, like the spine?  The spine.  Like one sentence?  No, I don't fucking Boy Meets Girl.  I don't give a shit about that.  Fuck Boy Meets Girl.  Fuck Motorcycle Movie.  No.  What is really being said?  What's really being said?  That's what you were talking about.  Because the whole idea, man, is subversion.  You want subversion on a massive level.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood 
[00:40:00]  is?  What?  Top Gun.  Oh, come on.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  Do you think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah, it's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks, sir.  It is a story about a man who struggled with his own homosexuality.  That's it.  That is what Top Gun is about.  You've got Maverick.  All right?  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line.  All right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  They represent the gay man.  Right.  All right?  And they're saying, go. 
[00:40:30]  Go the gay way.  Go the gay way.  He's still both ways.  What about Kelly McGillis, right?  Kelly McGillis.  She's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  And they're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way.  All right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie.  It's like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything.  They don't have sex.  He gets in the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here?  Next scene.  Next scene you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy. 
[00:41:00]  She's got the cap on.  She's got the aviator clashes.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears.  She goes, okay, this is how I'm going to get this guy.  This guy's going to get the gay way.  I've got to bring him back.  I've got to bring him back from the gay way.  So I'm going to do that through subterfuge.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right, that is how she approaches it.  Right.  Okay.  All right, but the real ending of the movie is when they fight the Minx at the end.  All right, because he has passed over into the gay way.  They are this gay fighting fucking force.  All right, and they're beating the Russians.  The gays are beating the Russians.  All right, and it's over, and they fucking land, and Iceman is trying to get Maverick the entire time. 
[00:41:30]  Finally, he's got him.  All right, and what is the last fucking line that they have together at all, hugging and kissing and happy with each other?  And Ice comes at the Maverick, and he says, man, you can ride my tail in time.  And what does Maverick say?  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  Sword fight.  That's fucking it, man.  Fucking love Quentin Tarantino. 
[00:42:00]  Brilliant.  Quentin Tarantino, man.  The gay way.  Opie and Anthony Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Where's our Friday guy?  I want to plug my Letterman's on tonight, too.  No, you can't do that.  David Letterman.  Myself and Keeper Sutherland.  Yes.  Oh.  Jimmy, I was there.  It already happened.  No, we did it Monday.  No, but I saw you on stage.  I saw Letterman walk over, shake your hand, said you did a great job. 
[00:42:30]  It's over, Jimmy.  I saw it.  You actually saw it on a TV, too.  I saw it on a TV, so how could it possibly be on tonight?  You were in the future.  That really is like going to the future.  I like being in the future.  The future.  I'm looking at, yeah, we've just been perusing celebrities, scantily clad.  I'm looking at Dakota Fanning.  Not too bad.  How old is she now?  14. 
[00:43:00]  Come on.  No, cute.  I see there's potential there.  She's not going to be a good-looking...  What?  Nah.  You're out of your mind.  Look.  You add a year onto that.  No, I'm not even going.  I'm just saying.  No, I think...  She's going to be ugly.  Are you kidding?  She's going to be ugly.  She's got youth on her side.  No way.  I say...  She's got that pre-teen cuteness.  No, what are they called? 
[00:43:30]  Tweens?  What the fuck is it?  Tweens.  Oh, wait.  Here.  What's a tween, by the way?  Danny over here.  Look at this.  It's kind of like your taint.  You tell me she's not going to be hot?  Let me see.  Yeah.  That's got hot written all...  Dude, you're talking to a fucking expert.  I don't know.  You're talking to an expert in this field.  I am the Dr. Michu Kaku of underage girls.  All right.  Why don't you keep it to yourself?  Jesus.  I don't have any fucking pornography.  I'm just saying.  I know when I look at a girl if they're going to end up hot or not.  Things are going well lately. 
[00:44:00]  Why don't you keep that to yourself?  I defy anybody to check my hard drive ahead.  It's nothing but stuff Gary Glitter would enjoy.  I did not make...  That is not Jim Norton saying that.  Jim Norton does not want his hard drive looked at.  Oh, okay.  You know, let's go to Allie Lohan.  Yes.  Yes, 15.  She's got some bikini pictures up.  Yes.  On what would Tyler Durden do?  WWTDD.com.  A great site for celebrity gossip. 
[00:44:30]  And let me tell you something with this.  Dumpy looking.  He made a very good point.  Allie Lohan.  Dumpy looking.  Look at her jumper right there.  Her face is like...  Oh, fuck the face.  She sucks and the freckles get in the way.  I was telling Anthony, freckles could get in the way.  She doesn't have as many as a Lindsay.  But it's Lindsay's younger sister and the mom is pimping out these daughters.  And what does Tyler Durden say about this?  He had a very good quote about what the mom's doing to this 15-year-old. 
[00:45:00]  She's 15 and dressing her up like...  Like a little whore bag?  Like a little whore bag.  She's in a bikini there.  And the Lindsay...  I mean, the Lohan girls are a little lanky.  They kind of look like close encounter aliens.  They all have very nice cans, though.  Yes, yes.  Nice cans.  Nice cans.  Yeah, yeah.  Danny, just go back to that.  He had a nice quote about...  Can you read that for us?  For us?  I can't read it from here.  It says, these pictures of Ali Lohan must have been processed with magic.  Because for the first time ever, she looks sort of effable. 
[00:45:30]  I know she's 15 and you're not supposed to have sex with 15-year-olds.  But it was her mom's idea to whore her up like she was 35 and not mine.  There you go.  So, yeah, she's got ample breasts.  She's laying on her stomach on a surfboard.  A nice shitter.  Showing off the ass.  That's the only reason she's laying down on a surfboard.  And then walking in the surf, kind of with her head turned.  Nice stride going there.  Looking good.  Looking completely fuckable. 
[00:46:00]  That big, stupid face of hers?  If I was a teenager, I wouldn't even like her.  No?  She has a big...  She has like a dumb Pittsburgh girl face.  Just the big, stupid, mopey teeth sticking out.  Does Pittsburgh have big-faced girls?  Just again, a lot of Pittsburgh girls are like...  You know when someone's just sitting there gazing off and their teeth are out of their mouth on their lip?  Ali Lohan, Lindsay Lohan's...  Oh, she is stupid-looking.  Sister.  That's what people are kind of asking.  Who are you talking about?  You can see it on W...  It's WWTSD. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, okay.  See what I'm looking at?  Oh.  No.  WOT.  Oh, gee.  WW.  Oh, I know what it is.  What do I win when I get it?  I know exactly what it is.  What?  This is a celebrity gossip site.  What would Ted Checkler be?  You should start that site.  Ted Checkler.  Yeah, so we were perusing during the commercials. 
[00:47:00]  Mel Gibson's chick.  What are they speculating?  Perhaps pregnant.  No.  Wow.  If he wrecks that body that quickly...  What a dope...  Why would he do that?  That chick is fucking...  He's got eight kids.  Because I'll tell you why.  He is a Catholic, like a ridiculous Catholic, and he probably doesn't wear a bag.  No bag.  And he doesn't pull out, and he doesn't do anything.  He probably pumps fucking creamy loads into everything he sleeps with.  He's been with that wife is forever.  He probably sticks the head in and comes when he's looking at what he's fucking. 
[00:47:30]  He pumps his jizz like he works for Krispy Kreme.  Shit.  Fuck.  Be more funny.  I couldn't wait to get that out.  Punch up a picture of that girl.  Fuck.  Krispy Kreme.  I hear she's pretty good.  Krispy Kreme.  Fuck me.  What's wrong with a Krispy Kreme donut?  Damn it.  I had it.  Do you like Krispy Brinkley?  That's her after a fire.  And you heard the excitement, too.  I couldn't wait.  Yeah.  Iron Sheik interview.  We got a few highlights.  I didn't shit. 
[00:48:00]  We got the Ghost of Girlfriends Past trailer.  We have to hear that.  And we got Joe Biden and the swine flu.  Joe Biden, widespread panic, just going crazy.  Don't do that to us.  Saying something stupid.  Oh, my God.  Don't do that to us.  That is what Mel Gibson is fucking.  We did this.  People are going, is this a best of?  No.  We're just looking at her again.  Is there anything better when a girl makes a U with her body?  Yeah.  She's on her elbows and her knees. 
[00:48:30]  And the arch in her back is exquisite.  Her tits are kind of like hanging perfectly down behind her arms a little.  And that ass is perched up just saying, put it right in there.  Put it in!  And that's why I do yoga every once in a while.  Well, if you need to ask, look at this picture.  I have no idea where the similarity comes in with you doing yoga and me looking at her picture.  Well, I want to see a photo of you like that.  If you've ever been in a yoga class, you'll see a lot of twisting and turning and girls not being shy about putting their bodies into some fun positions. 
[00:49:00]  What's that?  For you to look at.  What's that?  That's supposed to be her.  From what Travis is saying is that the bikini girl that they were reporting is not her.  Are you shitting me?  Who's that bitch?  But this is the one that every tabloid was reporting was the one that he was banging.  You know, her panties are tied up her ass there.  You think she's getting a shit stain on her neck panties?  I hope so. 
[00:49:30]  Wouldn't you take that and just...  Yes.  People would think it was a Sarge mask the way I walked around with her.  Everyone's saying wrong girl.  All right, whatever.  So Biden, Iron Sheik, Ghost of Girlfriend's Past.  Where do you want to go, Ant?  I would go Ghost of Girlfriend's Past.  Oh.  Why?  We have to hear this.  That was my third...  Third?  That was my third favorite.  It's a horrible movie.  No, it's fine.  Yeah?  Matthew McConaughey's latest movie.  I just figured we already hit on the Iron Sheik a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, you're probably right.  And then what's the other choice?  Biden is probably a quickie.  Biden's an asshole.  Oh, it'll be part of our whole swine flu update.  Yes, that's true.  You know, last we left you, the world was infected and millions were going to die.  So we'll see where we're at today.  Yeah.  Here's Ghost of Girlfriend's Past, the Matthew McConaughey movie that comes out today.  Another bomb for Mr. McConaughey.  McConaughey.  Good morning, Connor.  Versace is on one.  Okay.  One, two, three. 
[00:50:30]  You're ravishing.  Kiki, Nadja, Charlize, it's not going to work out for us.  Tell me you're not breaking up with me on a conference call.  Don't listen to these ladies.  They are crazy.  Connor, we can still hear you.  He's a maniac.  What are they trying to...  He actually went, because he's, dude, he's such a fucking ladies man, is what it is.  And he actually, get this, he called up a bunch of his girls that he's been fucking on a conference call. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, shit.  And broke up with them all at the same time.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no, he didn't.  On a conference call.  Oh, shit.  That's crazy.  Ugh.  This guy is in the shittiest movies ever made.  He is fucking unwatchably bad.  What was that one that I got stuck watching with the traffic girl?  Not Fool's Gold.  Fool's Gold.  Fool's Gold.  Fool's Gold.  Was she laughing? 
[00:51:30]  On Demand.  I think she fell asleep.  I was stuck watching it.  He was good in, what's the movie Jodie Foster did?  Contact.  He was good in that.  He was in Contact?  Yes, he was the religious guy and kind of a love interest.  How old is that movie now?  A few years, six, seven years, eight years?  What, Contact?  Ten years?  Contact came out in like 96, I'll say.  There's no reason to humiliate me.  Holy.  There's no reason.  I had no idea he was in that movie until right now.  There's no reason to talk to him.  He was such a complete disdain for my block by five years.  Hey, shithead.  What is it, eight years?  No, piece of shit. 
[00:52:00]  No, valuelism.  Five foot six.  97.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  He was good in We Are Marshall or whatever that movie was.  If you gave a shit about that dumb college football team that all died in a plane crash.  No, I didn't at all.  You realize that the story was like pretty much a whatever story in the end?  What about We Are Marshall's pilot?  What about him?  No movie for him.  No movie for him.  I envy the team.  No joke for me.  Well, if I didn't keep stepping on everybody with my weak attempt at him, we get it, Jim.  They didn't have to see the movie. 
[00:52:30]  Lucky them.  Who cares?  My dumb joke.  Has he ever been in a good movie?  Just contact.  I'm sure.  What else did he do?  What about A Time to Kill?  A Time to Kill I thought was very overrated.  Really?  Yes, extremely.  Which was that one?  The book was good.  Where it was a lawyer?  Ken Jackson.  Yeah, and Sondra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland.  Yeah.  Who wrote that book?  I did that on purpose, Jimmy.  It actually became, it was John Grisham's first novel, and after the worst music ever  in a movie, the Tom Cruise one, what was the one where he played the big one? 
[00:53:00]  Just, no.  The big John Grisham movie.  Who?  The Firm.  Oh, yeah.  Then people went back and bought A Time to Kill, and that became a...  Yeah.  I thought the movie was fucking awful, though.  I was sucked into the John Grisham novels.  Me too.  A young lawyer must, and then fill in the blank.  I was sucked in, and then by the third book, I'm like, I've read this book twice already.  For real.  Just a slight twist and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  I want to read the one about a young lawyer must suck his own cock as he's in a tire that  Winnie Mandela set on fire.  He's being rolled down a hill.  Tires with the gasoline in it.  Must blow his own load to put the fire out.  I saw a fucking video from Venezuela on one of those websites.  It's a fucking mob slowly burning a naked man to death.  That's fantastic.  What side do you go on?  I read that he was a pedophile.  I don't know if that's true or not.  But for this, you don't feel bad for the guy if he did that, but you empathize as a person 
[00:54:00]  how awful it must be.  As a human being?  Dude, he's on the fucking sidewalk, just like writhing, and then they keep kind of putting  him out.  He'll go out.  Oh, they were putting him out a little and then burning him slow?  Yeah, letting him burn out, and then they would do something to make him go on fire again.  They'd run by, kick him.  Dude, it was fucking...  How do you sleep at night after watching this shit?  Yeah, you watch some real twisted shit.  Hey, I don't fuck little girls, so I don't have to worry about it.  I'm not a pedophile.  No, but...  They'll protest it too much. 
[00:54:30]  Get the matches.  Even though the guy deserves it, that's just horrific to watch.  Dude, it's awful.  I've said that's where my line is.  I can't see that shit.  I watched that, and two videos of people who had been dissected, like, run over by trucks.  Why would you watch this?  And they're still alive.  Oh, God.  And they're still alive, and the fucking truck tire's still on them.  I've seen the, like, still pics of that.  You've never seen the video?  No!  Of a guy blinking his eyes and trying to get up.  Oh, stop it.  I've never watched that.  It's a guy, like, kind of laying there, just looking around.  Going, oh, I'm in Dutch.  And there's a fucking, like, there's always a giant truck tire on him. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Do you watch this just before you go to sleep?  No, but I have.  The other night I did, I woke up early.  My girlfriend can't watch it.  No girl on the other day can watch it.  No.  Most guys can't watch that.  For real.  It's horrific.  There's a small percentage of you guys out there that watch that crap.  It's upsetting.  Was that titled, Where Did Your Vagina Go?  I just spit everywhere.  Oh, my God!  Oh, fuck, her guts are all over the place. 
[00:55:30]  Wow, that is real bad.  Oh, is she alive?  She's still alive a little bit.  Wait a minute.  I don't know if she's alive.  Is the guy grabbing her tits?  Her legs are off her bones.  Yeah, that's obviously, um...  What, a tiger attack?  Is the guy grabbing her tits?  Is he feeling her up or trying to make...  He might be, you know, administering some kind of CPR.  Who knows?  He's just trying to get a good picture for his Facebook page.  Topping a feel.  Can we go back to the ghost of girlfriend's past? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Please.  That is a fucking mess.  I can't even look at that anymore.  Wow, yeah.  She was obviously in some sort of an accident.  It's not good.  She's not doing well.  People come apart.  So, what have we learned about Matthew McConaughey?  He's a...  Oh, he's a wild, womanizing kind of guy.  He's a photographer, of course.  He's a chick magnet.  Yeah, chick magnet.  The chicks are all after him.  But he'll learn his lesson, I bet, in this movie.  You think he's going to learn his lesson?  I think he's going to learn his lesson. 
[00:56:30]  You think there's going to be a turn?  I think there'll be a turnaround where he finally realizes, hey, you know something?  This isn't what life is all about.  But I'm speculating.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to learn some way, though.  Well, I don't want to see this.  What are we looking at now?  I want to see the trailer.  Listen to the trailer.  Okay, good.  They are crazy.  Connor, we can still hear you when you cover the camera, you know.  I didn't think you were going to make the rehearsal.  Yeah.  Connor Meade.  Ginny Parade.  If you do anything to detract from her wedding, I will sneak into your room in the middle of 
[00:57:00]  the night and cut off your favorite appendage.  And the first part sounds nice.  Wait, can you...  The first part sounds nice.  That's a fucking awful, fucking flirty voice.  First part.  First part.  And it has one of the worst things that I know Jimmy hates in movie trailers.  When the music's going and then the music stops, try to put in the funny line, and then  continue the music.  Hey, I don't like that.  Joke. 
[00:57:30]  Ding, ding, ding.  Oh, stug.  And the first part sounds nice.  This is going to be tougher than I thought.  Is that promoting this movie?  Tonight, you're going to be visited by three ghosts.  Look away.  You're dead.  No!  Whatever happens to your night is for your own good.  But now we're talking.  Hi, Connor!  Who are you?  See, now...  What happens?  Now he's going to be visited by the ghosts of Girlfriend's Past. 
[00:58:00]  This is Scrooge.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  This is Scrooge with chicks.  An updated version of Scrooge.  It's a chick movie Scrooge.  But you don't get to see Brass because it's a chick flick.  Well, of course.  Well, it's kind of like the Night of Christmas where it's Matthew McAllister has a bunch of  girls come back in season.  Matthew McAllister.  I like Matthew McAllister.  He's very good.  I like the funny part about the appending and the... 
[00:58:30]  He likes the first part.  That made me laugh a lot.  And Michael Douglas just looking like his father.  Oh, yeah.  He looks just like Kirk Douglas.  He gave up on the hair dye.  The hair dye, right?  On the Grecian formula.  Yeah, let's hope he doesn't behave like Eric did.  Hi, Connor.  Whoa.  Who are you?  Oh, I'm like the ghost of girlfriend's past.  Take a look.  I'm going to take you back through all your past girlfriends.  We dated for two days.  For an hour.  For 48 seconds. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  It's Jenny.  Hey.  Watch this move.  Watch this move.  We'll go out.  We'll have a little dinner.  What do you say?  We got to button you up.  You look like a gay pirate.  This is the moment you truly fell in love with Jenny.  You're a button pirate.  You're a completely veteran.  So you did what you do best.  You left.  From New Line Cinema.  I'm sorry.  This guy's voice.  You're actually apologizing, aren't you?  What if you could relive your past?  I'm going to keep it forever. 
[00:59:30]  I don't think I said that.  I'm going to keep it forever.  Okay, I get it.  What if you could listen in on the present?  When I see him again, I am just right back to where I was before.  What if you could change the future?  You can, asshole.  It's called living.  You do change the future.  Fuck you.  This is...  What if you could...  That fucking voice he's got.  Terrible.  That horrible...  What if...  What if you didn't have to see this movie? 
[01:00:00]  The broads are going to love this thing.  They're going to be all over it.  It's just this fucking...  It's just this fucking big far-headed asshole walking through with his stupid fucking Jimmy  Dean hairdo looking at a bunch of pretty girls he banged in this self-congratulating  fucking stupid movie.  Look at me.  Who wants to see this shit?  Awful.  That fucking haircut is enraging.  Awful.  Future.  Pictures of you.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She was supposed to be with me.  She was always supposed to be with me. 
[01:00:30]  What we used to be.  No!  No!  Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, and Michael Douglas.  I can't believe it.  You kept it.  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.  Ghosts of Girlfriends  No!  Does that just sound awful? 
[01:01:00]  Fucking horrendous.  I guess because girls love a scamp.  They love a rascally scamp.  I'm a piece of shit because I paid for it, but he fucks all these broads and he's a rascally  scamp.  Oh, look at him go.  That's me you're looking at.  If I was fucking, if I didn't have to pay for it, I've run through more broads than  that.  I just fucking boot him after.  So you think that's charming that I do that?  Ghosts of Prostitutes Past.  Starring Jim Norton. 
[01:01:30]  They played with his nipples.  And then they left.  You fucked me with the wet noodle dick.  Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  He just put the head in and moved his hips back and forth while I teased his nipples and  pretended I was anywhere else.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  Down, down, down.  Yeah.  And it's not me saying it.  It's the tranny.  I have a wacky look on my face.  What if you didn't get syphilis?  Horrid. 
[01:02:00]  Fucking awful.  Can we find the Family Guy clip?  Dominic on Long Island.  Dominic.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Ah, good evening.  On Family Guy, they have an episode where Stewie went after Matthew McConaughey.  They were sitting at a diner.  And Stewie was like, you suck.  You suck.  It might be worth the watch if you guys are interested.  Yeah, we'll take a look and see if it's worth throwing on the show today.  Worth the beak.  Thank you, Dominic.  Oh, okay.  You will.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  Apparently, Emma Stone is one of the girlfriends, and she was in an episode of Lucky Louie.  I remember her.  She was actually sexy.  She played like the snotty daughter of Mike and Tina.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She was a sexy girl.  Yeah.  I do remember that episode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Joe Biden.  Let's do our swine flu thing.  A little swine flu.  Everyone okay?  Anyone got the sniffles?  Jimmy has a weird...  I'm sick.  I've been sick all week.  Jimmy's got a weird throat thing happening.  You don't have a fever, though. 
[01:03:00]  No, no fever.  I just got a sore throat.  I was coughing, and I'm very congested.  It's cold.  It's nothing big.  I don't care.  Oh, my God.  Get to the hospital.  I don't fucking...  I'm never sick, so when I am, I fucking just take it like a man.  Fucking...  You know that half the cases are in New York City?  Half the cases of the swine flu?  I wouldn't care if I did have it.  Because of our diverse fucking city that we have.  We're so diverse.  Well, you got people flying everywhere.  It's a land of a city, right, you know.  So where are we at, Ant?  I didn't watch the news last night.  I was too busy doing this and that.  Well, a few of these schools that have been... 
[01:03:30]  That's pretty much been the big thing for New York have been the schools.  Closing the schools.  That's where they've gotten...  Well, that's where a lot of these cases have come up.  Because, you know, they're in close contact.  They went to Mexico.  There's always this Mexico tie-in.  And they said that the people that were ill at the schools have, without hospitalization,  without medicine, you know, except over-the-counter, make-me-feel-better shit, are getting better.  And there you go. 
[01:04:00]  It's running its course is what this is.  It's not this fucking killer plague that's going around.  And these cocksuckers, because I'm looking at eight TVs in here today.  Yesterday, every single TV we had on eight different channels were all about the swine flu, the graphics, this, live reports from here, shots of Mexico.  And I swear to you, the coverage today is almost nonexistent.  Barely there because it's starting to die down.  Already?  Already. 
[01:04:30]  But Tuesday, Wednesday, they had it as a pandemic, and it was going to affect the whole world, and this was going to be a big problem.  What do they say about human?  Definitely having death.  This is a human.  What was the?  Threat to humanity.  Threat to humanity, right.  Threat to humanity.  Well, do you know, I heard a guy define pandemic, which is what technically a pandemic really means, and it's when one person passes to another person in Mexico and then in the U.S., and if that happens one more time in Europe, that's technically a pandemic. 
[01:05:00]  Even though three people can be sick.  Or six people.  Yeah, it's that fucking minor.  They might have to redefine the word.  Yeah, maybe.  Because the pandemic to me is like, holy crap.  People freak out.  I am legend type shit.  Yeah.  People freak out.  And then yesterday, the big story also was somebody that went to Mexico with the Obama delegation when he was down there, came down with it.  And this was back in the middle of April.  Came down with it.  Did not fly with the president. 
[01:05:30]  Never got within eight feet of the president.  It was a big story.  Was the president close to this man?  But this guy went home, spread it to his wife, his kids, people at work, who then they said, who all, again, without hospital,  hospitalization, got better.  It's a flu.  It's the flu.  Could we get Dr. Steve on the phone today?  I'd love to.  Dr. Steve?  He'll set everyone straight with his swine flute thing.  Dr. Steve gave me a great birthday present. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, what was it?  Triumph of Will.  What is that?  It's the big Nazi propaganda movie that was made back in the 30s.  Is it cool to watch?  Oh, yeah.  It's history.  Shows Nuremberg.  All those fun parties they used to have, I guess.  A lot of people.  Can we get that queer on the phone?  Yeah, let's get Dr. Steve on the phone.  Joe Biden, though.  Yeah, this guy hasn't shown up.  I mean, the economy being the way it's been, sometimes Obama putting his fucking foot in  his mouth, all these stories coming up with Guantanamo and all that, and torture, nothing. 
[01:06:30]  No Joe Biden.  And now he finally pokes his periscope up for a second, and he fucking says something stupid.  You and I were discussing this before the show.  Triumph das Willens!  Triumph das Willens!  It's on YouTube.  Yeah, of course.  You and I were discussing this before the show, and we haven't seen Biden since Obama  had to do, and we don't remember exactly why, but there was some kind of press conference 
[01:07:00]  and Biden was just yapping, and Obama had to step in and go, no, all right, Joe, all  right, Joe, okay.  Now, Joe, I think it was something about, hey, by the way, Hillary wasn't the first choice  for Secretary of State.  Or something.  Oh, Joe!  Joe, all right, shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  And they hit him.  And we've said on this program that Joe Biden eventually is going to be a major problem,  and you're going to see them switch out vice presidents.  He's a huge liability.  If Obama, who knows, if he gets re-elected, no way does Biden do a second term with Obama. 
[01:07:30]  There's no fucking way.  He's just honest, I think, O'Biden.  Like, he just says what's on his mind.  O'Biden?  Yes, O'Biden.  He's the Irish counterpart.  He comes in.  O'Biden.  Yes.  I like his honesty, absolutely, but in Washington, they don't like that type of shit, no matter  who's in there.  You know what it is?  It gives the Republicans and conservatives easy pickings when he pops up and says something  stupid.  Well, this is what he said.  I think we have the news story or exactly what he said here. 
[01:08:00]  Let me ask you something, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, but if a  member of your family came to you, no, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family  came to you and said, look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back within  the next week, would you think it's a good idea?  I would tell members of my family, and I have.  I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now.  It's not that it's going to Mexico.  It's you're in a confined aircraft.  When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft. 
[01:08:30]  That's me.  I would not be at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting  they ride the subway.  So from my perspective, what it relates to is mitigation.  If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing.  If you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different  thing.  What did he say wrong?  He said he's pretty much the vice president of the United States, and he's really ruining  the airline industry by saying don't travel. 
[01:09:00]  And mass transit in general at a time when the economy really can't take another hit.  He's panicking.  Millions of people fly on a daily basis, and like a hundred and some odd people have this.  Yeah, right.  That's true.  So it's like it's overkill.  The guy is a leader.  He's supposed to be a leader that you listen to.  You say you take advice from in these situations, and he's fucking Pete Panic.  Yep.  I mean, relax.  Just kind of describing how not to get sick with the flu. 
[01:09:30]  You know, if you can avoid being in confined spaces, you know.  Yeah.  Well, stay at home.  Don't go out.  That's what I would do.  Spray Lysol.  Snort Lysol.  He, yeah, and the news on it is just really kind of, Biden's, I'm telling you what he meant.  Oh, is that what they do?  Boy, I'll tell you one thing that the Obama administration does better than any other administration. 
[01:10:00]  George Bush, everything.  They do better than anyone.  Telling us what people meant after they say something really fucking stupid.  Because his administration is, they're saying a lot of stupid shit.  That Homeland Security bitch they got in there is a dummy.  She's a dummy with zero qualifications to be the head of Homeland Security.  She's uttering these moronic fucking phrases on a daily basis. 
[01:10:30]  And then there's got to be other people going, no, what she meant was this.  Well, the media's not attacking the same way they did.  Hell no.  With conservatives.  Any more than they're fucking mentioning the racial bias case of Governor Patterson.  Oh, my God.  Firing a white photographer to hire the black one.  And then settling out of court for $300,000.  Yeah.  Once again, the fucking pathetic biased media isn't talking about that in the same way.  What does he care what a picture looks like anyway? 
[01:11:00]  Exactly.  The guy can't even see him.  The guy could have just been standing there going, ch-ch-ch with his mouth.  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  The white guy could have taken great pictures.  What did he think?  There was going to be some, you know, the white photographer wasn't going to show him in a good light?  So get a black guy and he could fucking be chummy with him?  I don't know.  Stop it.  Disgusting.  Well, thank God he only had to pay out that much money.  And not be chastised in front of the entire nation as a racist.  $300,000. 
[01:11:30]  Is that taxpayer money?  Of course it is.  Why the fuck should we have to pay for the governor's making what is a racist decision?  Why the fuck should that come out of his pocket?  Yeah, it should.  God, is that annoying.  Sell a lot of pencils to make that kind of money.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Standing with a cup of shit dick.  Fucking waving.  But get mad at fucking Fred Armisen for doing a blind thing about you.  Comment on that.  Let's hear you talk about your fucking, let's hear you talk about your settlement.  Out of court.  Talk about that the way you talk about SNL making fun of blind people. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  We're going to go back to the Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik.  Time for a few highlights from yesterday's appearance.  You want the Hulk Hogan stuff?  Oh, that was a classic.  The wrestling site's picking up on all the stuff he said about Hulk Hogan on our show  yesterday.  Here we go.  The Iron Sheik.  And Kennedy McMahon said, Sheik, put him over.  I know he's not your class.  He's a bodybuilder.  The guy used the juice.  Testosterone.  The juice?  He's not my class. 
[01:12:30]  And then I lost my belt for $1 million to that Hollywood brown jabroni faggot, Hulk Hogan.  Oh, boy.  You don't like Hulk Hogan there, Iron?  Take it.  All right.  How can I laugh today?  The man, he put the baby oil on top of her daughter's boss.  Oh, right.  Or he have sex with his daughter and girlfriend.  What kind of fucking man he is.  So I laugh this son of a bitch.  Hulk Hogan, go fuck yourself.  You can't even suck my ten-edged cock. 
[01:13:00]  Well.  Ten-edged cock thing again.  And then he continued.  So how about his wife?  His wife is a...  His wife, she's a gold digger.  But before that, she was good lady.  Yeah.  Very nice lady.  No.  Now she fucked the pool boy.  Oh, man.  But wait.  Let's get back to you.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Let me go.  I wish I could fuck that bitch because she needed ten-eleven cock to fuck her fucking bitch pussy. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, and he wasn't done.  He's kind of Hollywood and soft.  Don't you think, Hogan?  He's not like a real wrestler.  He's a Hollywood kind of soft guy.  He's a fucking shithead.  He's a drug addict.  He put a testosterone deco in his butt. 
[01:14:00]  That body is artificial.  I'm 60, seven years old.  Wow.  Yeah.  I can kick his butt right now.  Even I'm handicapped.  We got Dr. Steve on the line here.  We're talking about the swine flu.  Dr. Steve, how are you, sir?  Hey, guys.  Hi, Steve.  You want to follow the Iron Sheik?  Yes.  I'm sorry about that.  Bad timing on our part.  A little incontinence going on there with the Iron Sheik. 
[01:14:30]  So let's get the facts out there.  The swine flu.  Yeah.  The ABCs.  What are we worried about here?  Well, okay.  This is one of those viruses that pigs have all the time.  It's actually what's called endemic in the pig population.  E-rock flu.  The pig farmers have a vaccine for it, but we don't.  And so this is a virus that has jumped from them, you know, from the swine population to the human population. 
[01:15:00]  We've never been exposed to it before.  However, the flu vaccine that was out this year won't cover for this.  So, you know, even if you've had the flu vaccine, you would be susceptible to it.  Now, the reason everybody got scared about it is because in Mexico they had 1,600 cases and 103 people died.  But the thing is that we have to remember, and that's about a 6%, you know, lethal rate.  The thing that we have to remember is that's Mexico, and they may have had way more cases than actually got reported. 
[01:15:30]  You know, a lot of people could have had mild disease.  And if it was, you know, if it was really 16,000 people that had the virus and only 1,600 got reported, then the lethal rate is a lot less.  Right.  Does that make sense?  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  And plus it's Mexico.  They could have died of other things.  Could have been a guy on the way of the doctor.  It's just weird that it's not been as severe up here. 
[01:16:00]  And that one kid that passed away in Texas actually was visiting from Mexico.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It wasn't even one of your regular old Americans there.  Well, I mean, you know, but it's still a mystery why it seemed to be so much more severe there.  But, of course, we've only had 109 cases in the United States as of yesterday at 1030.  So we'll see today.  Now, what we're looking for is a geometric progression. 
[01:16:30]  You know, if you saw The Hot Zone or whatever that movie was, you know, you're looking for it to go from, you know, 30 to 60 to 120 to 240 to 480.  And, you know, that would show kind of a geometric progression.  Now, the day before yesterday, we only had 90 or we had 90 cases.  Yesterday, there was 109.  And that so far doesn't show that kind of progression, you know.  But it's still a very few number of cases that have been reported. 
[01:17:00]  So it remains to be seen.  And I'm hearing now that, you know, a lot of people are just kind of sitting it out, taking some over-the-counter medication for symptoms and then just getting better.  Yeah.  Well, most people will do okay with influenza.  The ones that are at risk are, you know, young kids and pregnant women and old folks with chronic diseases and stuff like that.  Although, you know, if your immune system is just adjusted just wrong, it can really hit you hard even if you're young and healthy. 
[01:17:30]  But that's unusual.  Like Robert Reed would have had a hard time with this.  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's exactly right.  The, um, shit, now what was I going to say?  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  No, it's okay.  The good thing about this virus is it is totally susceptible to the two big antiviral drugs that we have, which is Relenza and Tamiflu. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  And Tamiflu is the pill.  Relenza is the inhaler where you inhale two little capsules twice a day.  And, uh, but you got to get it, um, early.  And the symptoms, let's talk a little bit about that.  The symptoms are, you know, a fever greater than 100.5, uh, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and pains.  Might have nausea and vomiting, but usually doesn't, but could.  Oh, a fever of 105 or more? 
[01:18:30]  No, 100.5.  Oh.  105.  I don't have.  You're hallucinating.  I'm, uh, I have a sore throat and sniffles and a cough.  But I've had it, like.  Without the fever, it's unlikely that you have influenza.  I'm not even worried about swine flu.  I just want to know if I can get some.  What should I take for this, do you think?  Because I'm feeling a bit under the weather.  And I have a fucking, I'm doing it.  I'm singing at Carnegie Hall this weekend.  You'll be fine.  What should I take, Dr. Steve? 
[01:19:00]  Um, you could, you know, uh, you can take, uh, any of the over-the-counter stuff that, um.  Boo.  What?  Never mind.  Don't take anything.  No, I want a really good recommendation, a good secret recommendation.  Yeah, something, something fun.  But, but, so it's pretty much the flu, right, Dr. Steve?  That's the headline?  It's pretty much it's the flu that we just, our immune systems haven't seen before.  And most of us that get the flu, we don't really even take anything for it. 
[01:19:30]  We just kind of like.  You take something for the symptoms.  Yeah, we just kind of wait it out and deal with it.  Yeah, taking ibuprofen or Tylenol for the fever and taking, uh, uh, you know, Mucinex for the cough  and, uh, uh, Claritin or Benadryl for the stuffy nose will usually get you through.  The big thing is prevention.  Just wash your hands.  I mean, the way you get this is, um, someone sneezes into their hand and then they touch, 
[01:20:00]  uh, a, uh, uh, doorknob and they're-  Ugh, animals.  Filthy animal, exactly.  Ugh.  Uh, mucus and virus-filled hands and then it can live on there for a couple of hours  and then you touch it and then you stick your disgusting finger in your nose or your eye  and then that's how you get the virus.  Oh.  Is it, I went to a place, like a flu ward, there's a place where there's a bunch of people  with swine flu and I jerked three of them off into my palm. 
[01:20:30]  Rubbed it on my face.  Yeah.  Snort it on your nose.  You'll be all right.  Bukkake video with them.  Into my palm.  Yeah, I put a little piggy nose in my hand and it all came on it.  We want to film a video where we just walk around Manhattan sneezing in people's faces.  And watch people panic in elevators and stuff.  Yeah.  All right, Dr. Steve, thank you so much.  And thank you for your very generous, uh, birthday gift, that, uh, Triumph of Will.  Wow.  Wow.  That is really some, uh, a powerful documentary, uh, propaganda documentary, whatever you want 
[01:21:00]  to call it.  Your favorite historical figure.  Of course.  You know, the woman that made that movie, like, what, she died like 10 years ago or  something?  Yeah.  She was alive for quite a while and just getting, just getting razzed for having made that movie.  Yeah, it didn't help her career in the long run.  No, it didn't.  Oopsie.  Well, thank you, uh, Dr. Steve.  Mucho appreciado, as they say, and, uh, swine flu, uh, HQ.  You're welcome, my friend.  Uh, we are going to do about 20 minutes on this on Weird Medicine tomorrow night at 5 p.m. 
[01:21:30]  So, at what time?  Very good.  Uh, 5 p.m.  5 p.m.  Dr. Steve in a Weird Medicine on 202 and 197 on Sirius.  You got it.  All right.  Bye, Steve.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Doc.  We go back to the Iron Sheik because we got two brand new Iron Sheik things to play today.  Oh.  I guess we all want to re-hear him talking about his 10-inch cock, right?  He has non-existent penis.  Here it is.  The Iron Sheik and his 10-inch cock from yesterday's great interview.  All right.  Show Iraq the 10-inch cock, Iron Sheik. 
[01:22:00]  He's a Hulk Hogan fan, too.  For real.  Is it ready?  Want a show here?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  You don't mind?  Yes or no?  I don't care.  Ah, guys.  Ah, what the hell?  We're just a bunch of guys.  Hey, Thursday.  Ready?  You want a show?  But maybe next time.  If he's okay.  Maybe next time.  No.  No.  Maybe next time.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We got to move to the imagination.  We got to move to the imagination.  Iraq, get over there.  Take a look at the tennis cock.  I don't think the Sheik is lying.  Wait a second.  Wait, your other guy, Iron Sheik, wants you to show Iraq the tennis cock. 
[01:22:30]  There a light over there?  I can't even see it.  If you said, okay, I'll show you.  Oh, the show.  Show the cock.  Show the cock.  Show the cock.  Show the cock.  What's this about?  Look at that Tony Montana shirt he's got out.  Oh, he's going to show Iraq the tennis cock.  He's on seven of the men.  You're on seven of the men.  You're on seven of the men.  Holy shit.  Where is it?  Iraq, he's shaking the ball bag.  That day was...  What a set of balls on the sheet. 
[01:23:00]  That was all balls.  Jimmy, what was that?  I didn't...  It was all balls.  It was all balls.  It was like an acorn.  What happened to the tennis cock?  What happened to his tennis cock?  It was non-existent.  Yeah.  A little thumbie nub resting on a giant ball bag.  Wow.  And then he talked about pussy.  What about pussy?  Oh, I get the pussy everywhere I go.  That's it.  I get some of the finest pussy in the world.  You know what I mean? 
[01:23:30]  Could you do a pussy promo for us?  That's how he...  That's how he...  Do a wrestling promo, but talk about pussy.  Pussy, I'll be honest with you.  If it's a good blue eyes, good blonde, I'd love to eat the pussy of the blue eyes and blonde.  Otherwise, I'd fuck her ass.  So she did...  If she has brown hair, you'd fuck her ass.  That might have been the greatest quote ever.  I just said...  It might have been.  I had a woman all over the world.  Unbelievable. 
[01:24:00]  Well, the new stuff.  Right after the appearance, Sam got him in the hall.  A little backstage with ONA here.  Oh, he did.  With the Iron Sheik.  A little post-show.  Oh, unheard.  Yeah, this is a brand new post-show interview from yesterday.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and we're going backstage with ONA.  Obi and Anthony recently got a chance to talk to the Iron Sheik.  We found the Sheik after the interview, who had just publicly shown his penis for the very first time.  What do you think of E-Rock?  E-Rock was the guy who wanted to see your 10-inch cock. 
[01:24:30]  Well, I never showed it before.  First time, he wasn't trusted to see the Iron Sheik 10-inch cock.  That's the guy I showed you.  You think E-Rock was probably a gay guy?  I looked like it to me.  E-Rock may be gay, but according to the Sheik, at least he's not dirty.  Did he look like he was clean enough that you would put it in his ass?  Absolutely.  I should have put him in the camera crash.  Maybe he can't feel that 10-inch cock.  And not everybody believe he's gay.  Otherwise, why do you want to see the Iron Sheik 10-inch cock? 
[01:25:00]  Thanks, Sheik, and may God bless you.  God bless you guys.  Like I said, the city never sleeps.  Have a great time.  I hope I see you guys again soon.  And also, I want to say hello today to all my intelligent radio stations.  God bless you guys, and have a good day.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts.  Stay tuned, and Opie and Anthony will be right back.  Actually, we're still here, yeah.  Wow.  That was good.  Not bad.  That is something. 
[01:25:30]  Fucking Sheik, man.  What the hell was he thinking?  As we go to break, a listener suggested we do the Christian Bale Iron Sheik remix.  Yes.  Please.  I know the Christian Bale thing is kind of fading away, but maybe one last one.  I think if anything should bring it back, it is this.  All right.  Derek, spend some time working on this.  What the fuck are you doing?  Suck my 10-inch cock.  Think for one fucking second.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:26:00]  Suck my 10-inch cock.  No.  No.  Don't be cheap, you son of a bitch.  10-inch my cock.  What don't you fucking understand?  Good question.  You got any fucking idea about, hey, it's fucking distracting?  Good question.  Give me a fucking answer.  I love you.  Suck my 10-inch cock.  I want to fucking kick your fucking ass.  You don't shut up for a second, all right?  Oh, big sir.  You do it one more fucking time, and I ain't walking on the set if you're still hired. 
[01:26:30]  Go fuck yourself.  I'm fucking too good.  For fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  Wow.  That was great.  That's good, man.  Like you're going to fuck him, but no.  No, you're not going to be fucking him.  No.  You're going to fuck him.  Well done, Derek.  Yeah, definitely.  Great job, Derek.  Let's say hi to Wide Open, the trucker.  Wide Open.  How are you, sir? 
[01:27:00]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's going on, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  I'll tell you one thing.  I was going down through South Carolina yesterday, and when y'all come on and said,  the Iron Sheik has pissed his pants.  I almost pissed mine.  That was a great interview.  That was great yesterday.  I'll tell you.  Thank you.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  Thank you, Wide Open.  All right.  Y'all have a good day.  Jimmy, I hope you feel better, buddy.  Thank you, man.  I hope so, too.  I'll be okay.  Don't forget, Jimmy, a healthy Jimmy will be on Letterman tonight, which is weird because  he's sick, so I don't really understand how that happened.  I'm on the David Letterman program. 
[01:27:30]  But how are you going to do it if you're sick, Jimmy?  Well, it was done in the past, and I said to Dave, let's just show this one Friday.  I'm not going to be feeling well.  And Dave said, are you sure?  Has Christian Jimmy, have y'all seen him lately?  No, we don't know where Christian Jimmy's been.  Maybe after the break.  Yeah, he wasn't finding too many things to say, so Christian Jimmy just kind of went  away.  Yeah.  He might be down in Cancun trying to get everything straight.  He certainly is.  He's helped working with the poor.  All right, boys.  Y'all be good.  I'm heading back up toward the tall hill state. 
[01:28:00]  We'll talk to you later.  All right.  Peace.  Wide open, everyone.  Quick break.  He's wide open.  Hey, we got Judah Friedlander coming in to say hi from 30 Rock.  He's becoming a regular on the show.  Judah had a funny line.  I saw him at the comedy club the other night, and he has a full beard.  And he's such a mess on stage.  He's like, I just shaved 40 minutes ago.  The fastest beard hair comes back.  Judah's a funny dude, man.  He really is.  And we got Shawn Stevenson?  Yes.  Is that how you say his name?  Yes. 
[01:28:30]  He's pretty much a mess.  He's in a wheelchair.  He's a mess.  He's a midget.  But he's a motivational speaker.  Yep.  I am.  And this is what Bill Clinton, for real, had to say about Shawn Stevenson, who's coming  in today.  Get him the fuck away from me.  I first met Shawn when he was a delegate to Boys Nation, and I was so impressed with him,  we invited him to come back and work in the White House.  He worked there, and he did a great job.  He's an amazing person with an important message. 
[01:29:00]  And I think all the young people in this country ought to listen to him.  Damn.  That's a nice endorsement, right?  Wow.  He said that about me.  He said, Paul Hargis.  Hargis.  All young people should listen to Paul.  He's 57 years young.  Uncle Paul.  You ghoul, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Don't be such a towel, tell.  Just kind of wipe your memory clean, start fresh. 
[01:29:30]  Sick fuck.  It's so fucking wrong.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Heading toward the weekend.  Where's Kenny?  I know you.  I thought I told him.  Oh, here he comes.  Look at him running.  Look at everyone just running.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's like the T-Rex chasing the Jeep in Jurassic Park. 
[01:30:00]  Kenny's fucking short hairdo is horrendous.  Oh, you don't like his little short hairdo?  It's horrendous.  I don't know what is going on with his hair.  Jimmy doesn't like your short hairdo.  When I cut it, I get my money's worth.  $10 haircuts?  Yeah.  You know, you go to the neighborhood, Italian guy.  Italian guy?  You went to the neighborhood barber?  Yeah.  With the barber pole?  He sure has it.  Yeah? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Did he like the Iron Cheek yesterday?  He wanted me to be a wrestler.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Why don't you wrestle?  Can you piss your pants?  Kenny, we learned this week that you're a big fan of the classic disco, the classic dance.  You thought we forgot about you, right?  We'd just been too busy.  Kenny made a demo.  He certainly did.  And he really wants to be on The Strobe as maybe a guest DJ. 
[01:31:00]  And I think we can make this happen.  The Strobe is the channel.  It's the one that plays all, like, classic disco music.  Is that right, Kenny?  It's like classic disco?  I'm made to entertain.  Yes, it's classic disco.  I'll try to answer for him.  Thank you, Ed.  You're still out of breath, right?  Yeah, I'm not used to running the 100-yard dash.  Kenny, you've got to, like, grow your hair out a little bit.  Yeah, in a couple weeks.  Because it really makes it look like you have a small brain. 
[01:31:30]  That's a given.  Jimmy, look at his head.  It's a fucking Tyrannosaurus head.  It is like a pinhead kind of a thing.  You're almost a pinhead.  An angelfish.  I'll tell you, though, I can't wait for tomorrow.  What's tomorrow?  Why's that?  You don't know what tomorrow is?  The day after Jimmy Norton is on David Letterman?  I'll tell you, because tomorrow I get better looking every day.  Oh. 
[01:32:00]  All right, so anyway, Kenny made a demo for The Strobe.  I just Twittered Kenny's hairdos.  Oh, you did?  Fucking awful.  Good Twitter.  Damn.  Why don't you just shave your head?  No, that would be silly.  With a fucking shotgun.  That's a hair don't, Kenny.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow, there it is.  Yeah, wow.  It is a horrendous.  Why can't, by the way, Opie, how come when you tweet, you have words, what you write will 
[01:32:30]  appear over your picture, but on mine it doesn't?  What fucking application do I have?  I'm not telling you.  Why?  I can tell you.  Yeah, I want to use it.  Mine sucks.  Why can't you read that?  You've got to sign up for The Other Thing.  The Other Thing.  You've got to go to The Other Thing.  There's another Other Thing.  Other Thing.  Well, we'll show you.  It's easy.  Will I lose all my tweets?  Yes.  I don't want to.  Everything will go away.  Here's Kenny's demo for The Strobe.  What channel is The Strobe, Kenny?  Give me a little plug.  83 on XM.  83 on XM? 
[01:33:00]  Starring Joe Causey.  Joe Causey.  You really know the players on the channel?  Causey plays good music.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  This is what you would hear if Kenny was on The Strobe.  For real.  We're trying to get this done.  A little demo.  Don't you love that?  Hey, you're listening to The Strobe on Sirius 81 and XM 83.  I'm lean, mean, club soda, Kenny, the dancing machine. 
[01:33:30]  Vote for me, mayor of this place, Funky Town by Lip Sync.  Wow.  Yeah.  Vote for you.  You want to be the mayor of Funky Town.  Who doesn't?  By Lip Sync.  Yeah.  I always thought it was Lip Sync.  Oh, it's Lip Sync.  Lip Sync.  Yeah, I think there was a little play on words there.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the birthday boy.  Well, his birthday was yesterday.  He has a song about the swine flu. 
[01:34:00]  It's Bobo.  Bobo.  The swine flu.  It's in my hometown of Queens pretty hard.  But Wendy, look out.  I think it's spread out to Jersey.  Wah, wah, wah.  All right.  I think that bit could officially.  More of Club Soda Kenny's disco demo for The Strobe.  Wow.  Michael Jackson, what a goof. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, it's me, Lean Mean Club Soda Kenny, The Dancing Machine, on The Strobe, XM83, Sirius 81.  And coming up next are my Harry Bush favorites, The Weather Girls.  It's Rain and Men, y'all.  And have we got no...  And then it was Rain and Men. 
[01:35:00]  Hallelujah.  Can I tell you?  Yeah.  I would be the hugest fan of The Strobe if you were on there.  Who would not tune this in?  I would listen every fucking day.  Hold on, man.  We got Mike in Albany now.  Mike?  Mike Tower.  Hey, good morning, boys.  We didn't know you were from Albany, Mike.  Hey, I need a favor from you guys.  I saw the Dane Cook show last night.  Yes.  And Bob Kelly was there.  Yes.  He fucking killed. 
[01:35:30]  Where were you?  Yeah, can we...  Hold on, I want to...  Albany.  Dane Cook and Bob Kelly on tour.  And we beat the shit out of Robert Kelly on this show.  But I hope people understand.  This guy is fucking hilarious.  Yeah, we don't beat...  He's hilarious on the show as well.  Yeah.  But I mean, you know, his comedy is unbelievable.  Bob's a very funny guy.  He's just a dummy.  I heard...  It's not that he's not funny.  He's a lover.  There are a ton of people who thought Bob was better than Dane Cook.  Yeah.  And I'll say this.  And I'll say this in defense of Dane or anybody else who's headlining. 
[01:36:00]  There's always virtually no pressure on the guy that goes up first because people expect  nothing out of you.  And I would never fucking...  And Bob is a...  You know, Bob can headline.  Bob's a funny fuck.  I would never put Bob in front of me on the road.  I give Dane respect for doing that.  He's out of his mind.  He's like, why would you go on after 25 minutes of Bob fucking murdering?  Hey, you guys do need to help him, though, because Bob Kelly can't dress to save his  life.  He looked like such a fucking douchebag.  What are you, a fucking fashion consultant? 
[01:36:30]  Well, what do they have on?  I'll tell you.  No, but when he goes up on stage and he's wearing a purple t-shirt and like a pleather jacket.  Yeah, he's an asshole.  Bob is trying to be sexy Bob.  He's out of...  I'm disgusting Bob.  Now he's trying to be fucking handsome Bob.  But he's dressing like a fucking gay guy in the late 80s club scene.  He's got to stop.  You know what, dude?  I'm taking care of myself.  I'm looking good.  I'm feeling good.  You know what, dude?  It's all about...  So how'd you lose the weight?  Hey, what's the big... 
[01:37:00]  I've run out of gas, Bob.  Yeah, what's the big story today?  What's the big story in the news that we could ask Bob?  Oh, please.  Bob Kelly.  There's so many.  Swine flu.  Yeah, the swine flu.  I don't remember.  I think we've covered them all.  All right, we'll think about it.  Yeah, he kills, man.  He fucking kills on stage.  Let's get back to Club Soda Kenny.  His disco demo for the strobe.  I hated that song, but this is a great song on the strobe XM 83, Sirius 81. 
[01:37:30]  I'm lean, mean, Club Soda Kenny, the dancing machine, and we're going back to the good old  days, before AIDS was invented, back when you could bang any $4 coke for you wanted, no  matter what he looked like.  It's We Are Family by Sister Sledge.  I got a few more seconds to kill.  So listen how terrific I am, because here's the song now. 
[01:38:00]  He hit the post.  Yeah, going in now.  Oh, my God.  The instant feedback has exploded.  Everyone's saying they would listen to Kenny.  Everybody.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it would get old after a week or two, but.  Oh, people are smart.  You'd have a strong week of radio.  I don't know.  People might enjoy that, because they're listening to the same fucking songs they've heard 10,000  times.  They might enjoy just his take on it.  But in between, you'd get that Kenny thing, oh, it would be fantastic. 
[01:38:30]  A good DJ.  Now, is that an XL channel with language?  It will be.  They just can't curse, that's all.  Every channel should be able to curse.  I've got to do my thing.  Well, I agree, but I mean, a lot of them want to be played in fucking stores and stuff.  You're not going to compromise your values and integrity for that?  You do the show you do.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just saying.  I know.  It's a point well taken, James.  You want success?  You want success?  Or do you want to just languish?  All right.  I'm trying to help you. 
[01:39:00]  I'm trying to help you get to the top.  You're right.  In a good suit.  It's not good enough just being cheeky and flippant.  Cheeky and flippant.  I love them.  Here's another clip from Clips of the Kenny's disco demo for The Strobe.  This always brings a tear to my eye.  This song that you just heard.  But I'm lean, mean, club soda, Kenny, the dancing machine, taking you back to a time, play the music, when there were more disco balls than the ones in my pants. 
[01:39:30]  It's Gloria Gaynor.  I will survive on the Strobe.  I will survive on the Strobe.  I will survive on the Strobe.  Poor disco ball.  Yeah, what time was that when there were more than two disco balls?  That's crazy.  Wow.  What a wild time.  Jesus, Kenny.  Disco in my pants. 
[01:40:00]  It's The Strobe.  XM 83, Series 81.  I'm lean, mean, club soda, Kenny, the dancing machine.  We're getting ready to hit the town in our favorite pair of crotch huggers.  And if you run out of moose, just drop a load in your hand and slick back your hair with that.  It's Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees.  I love how he's just stomping over the vocals. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  That didn't matter.  He had his great line.  Yeah, he has to get his shit out there.  About the jizz moose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody could hit the post.  Exactly.  You've got to be entertaining.  Yeah, I'm an innovator.  I'm not a follower.  See, people are saying this is perfect for a GTA radio station.  Actually, NDA in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  This is perfect for GTA.  If they were still doing it that way.  Speaking of Boston, my friend Jay Moore will be in Boston tomorrow night.  What happened?  Oh, at the Wilbur.  The Wilbur Theater.  Bill Blumereich is the place. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he's in Long Island tonight, West Hampton Performing Arts Center.  My brother is going.  There will be a Hughes there.  Yeah, so Jay, take care of my bro.  He's done.  He wanted to see you badly.  Two more from Kenny's disco demo for The Stroke.  I love Diana Ross.  I really love her.  I'm Lee Mean, Club Soda Kenny, the Dancing Machine, here on The Stroke.  Cheers to anyone.  Next time, 83.  For all you Wilbur-rackers out there, here's the military people with Macho Man. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  Really spit that out.  Well, there was only four seconds to the thing.  Yeah.  To the thing.  They show you how much time you got to the thing.  Yeah, but I usually didn't pay attention to that.  Yeah.  You know, any dummy can look at the line and know when to stop talking.  Obviously.  One last one for today.  Yeah, because you got to leave them wanting more.  Yeah.  Will you do another one of these for us next week?  I think this has legs for a few more.  G.H., you know I do what I'm told.  All right. 
[01:42:00]  I could care less about the song you just heard, but this song is terrific.  I'm Lee Mean, Club Soda Kenny, the Dancing Machine.  Are you?  And here's the theme song for all you ugly chicks who think you're beautiful.  It reminds me when I was hanging in the club with my main man, Joe Causey, and I met this  chick and she told me she was an attorney.  So I said, Ben Dover, let me cross-examine you. 
[01:42:30]  Here on the stroke.  You really didn't even try on that one, did you?  A lot of fun.  Didn't even try.  All right.  Write some new material over the weekend and do another one of these.  And I want a new name.  I think we got a wholeness.  He should have a few different names.  I want a new name, everyone.  Instead of Lee Mean, Club Soda Kenny, I want a new name.  I kind of like the Dancing Machine all the time.  It could be, yeah, I just want new names. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  You should reinvent yourself every time.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, let's go to the phones and get some feedback for you, Kenny.  Seymour from Florida.  Yeah, it's Kenny, the Lean Mean Dancing Machine.  All right.  We got it.  Punching out.  All right.  Andrew.  Andrew, what did you think of Kenny?  What's up, guys?  I think we found the new Broadway Bill Lee and Joe Corsi right there in the studio.  Who's Broadway Bill?  Do you know Kenny?  Yeah, he's another one of them.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  Another one of them.  Yeah.  Thank you, mister.  No problem, Ken.  Have a nice day.  And then Bird in Philly writes, beware, G.H. is going to charge a handling fee for the  boogie.  You can take requests and talk to people.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know how personable I am.  You do all right.  I'm socially napped.  You do all right.  All right.  I think he's right.  We're going to do another one of these next week. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  Is the strobe?  What kind of channel is the strobe?  Classic disco.  Classic disco, man.  That's what you want to hear.  Yeah.  A lot of Donna Summer.  Yeah.  Bee Gees.  Probably a lot of Bee Gees, right?  It's off the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.  Yeah.  And then when I get my own show, I'll throw in a little hip hop just in front of it.  Oh, man.  That might fuck them up, though.  Yeah.  For the goof.  I don't want that. 
[01:44:30]  For the goof.  For the goof.  All right.  For the goof.  All right.  I think we're getting ready for kosher sports today.  Where's Judah?  Oh, yeah?  Judah should be here soon.  What the fuck?  David, whose internship's ending very soon, and I don't think we can keep him around.  How can we not keep David around?  If we can't find a way to keep David around, we are dummies.  I don't know how we keep him around.  I tried to get him the mail clerk, the mailroom job.  Yeah, Kenny looks after David.  If we lose another guy on this show, how can we lose David? 
[01:45:00]  I don't understand.  When I was growing up in this business, I hung out at radio stations, and you were allowed  to do that because you really wanted to just hang out.  And, like, the new way they do things just doesn't make sense.  You got guys who would hang out for free.  But the liability, there's a liability in...  To learn the business, they're just not allowed to do it anymore.  Wait, isn't he?  I used to sleep at radio stations. 
[01:45:30]  For real.  Isn't he allowed to hang out if he doesn't do certain things?  He is allowed to hang out.  It's more lawyer bullshit.  It really is.  They don't get it.  You got guys that are motivated.  They have to, like, make their mark in four months as an intern.  And then what?  Then what happens to these guys?  Yeah.  You know?  When they would hang out for, like, easily a year because they enjoy doing it.  It's like...  Ugh.  It's not always about money and liability.  It's about doing the right thing.  Someone like David would hang out.  And we would try to find a place for him, obviously. 
[01:46:00]  We wouldn't take advantage of him working for free.  But he would want to continue for free.  Yeah.  And you should be allowed to do that.  Should be.  And it should be a simple form that the dopey lawyers could come up with and go,  All right, well, you know, you're going to continue as a non-paid employer.  Yeah, some kind of volunteer schedule or something.  He could come as a daily guest.  We could add him to our guest list every day, and he could come in every day.  Can he do that?  Why wouldn't we be able to have our own guests in on a daily basis?  Good point. 
[01:46:30]  The lawyers just don't get it.  Half the guys in radio did exactly, you know, that.  They would hang around radio stations for free to, you know...  Yeah, to try to get their foot in the door.  Yeah, and to make their mark and to, you know, do some social networking and all that shit  until some kind of break happened.  Yep.  You know, these internships, honestly, the way they do it is a waste of time.  It's a waste of time for the interns.  Yeah.  Because they've got to make their mark in four months, and then we're like,  Well, look, we're not hiring. 
[01:47:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  And we show them the door, and then what?  What happens to these guys?  Yeah.  And they want to hang out and stay.  Oh, look, he's looking in the window at us.  Jesus Christ, like a fucking puppy.  Yeah.  XM website is gone.  What does that mean?  It means that the whole keeping the XM thing was a fucking being polite.  Yeah, that's true.  Let's say hi to Tim.  Tim?  It's right there.  How's it going, guys?  God, you guys suck out there.  I think that Kenny should give us a bit of yowza, yowza, yowza. 
[01:47:30]  Ah.  There is one website that's inactive, but it's not the XM one.  No.  Our website.  Yeah, everyone's asking about it.  We've got to figure out what the next move is with that thing.  Yeah, eat a bullet as well.  Hey.  No, I'm sorry.  I haven't had a website in six months.  For real?  For real.  Why?  Because I was having, because the fucking company who I was dealing with, I really began to hate  because I couldn't send out mass emails.  It was always crashing the system, and I just was like, fuck it. 
[01:48:00]  I've got to get a good website.  People submitted a bunch of things.  I just didn't follow it up, and the managers and agents talked about it, and they're not  that good at following it.  We need a webmaster that completely gets it, and we will get there.  We'll get opiananthony.com rocking again.  In the meantime, we're all doing stuff on our Twitters that sort of keep the vibe going.  I'm not saying that it's got to be better than that.  I'm not trying to say that replaces the website.  Absolutely not, because there's so much more you can do with a website than a Twitter account, 
[01:48:30]  but at least you guys can follow us on Twitter and get some of the shit that's going on in  the studio.  I think websites are less...  And eventually we'll get a nice website up and run it again.  I think they're less crucial now than they were a few years ago, because you do have  YouTube, and you do have MySpace and Facebook.  There's like a million places people can find you, find out what you're doing.  We still need one central opiananthony.com, and then it has our Twitter accounts and our  YouTube accounts and the Mogulist thing.  Everything is in one place for the people to go to and then figure out what they want to 
[01:49:00]  do from there.  So we'll figure it out sooner than later, Till.  It is true.  Kenny, thank you.  Thank you.  Kenny's doing double duty.  You're also writing Kosher Sports today.  Thank you for acknowledging me today, this May day.  Do I get grapes?  Yes.  Yeah, we've got to wait for the street vendors to come out.  Fucking cut of roaches.  Yeah.  God.  Go fetch something.  I will.  Thank you.  Hey, Kenny, you know what?  Yes, sir?  You haven't skipped down that hall yet. 
[01:49:30]  It's made for you.  You're right.  Yeah, I haven't.  Get your flip camera out.  Yeah, we'll do it during the break.  Okay.  All right.  He's like, okay.  Okay.  Anything else I can do for you guys?  Coughing.  Huh?  Excuse me for coughing.  I don't know what coughed on.  You know what Kenny was just thinking right there, by the way, in his little pea brain?  He's thinking, there are cameras all over that hallway, and I'm trying to show them I'm 
[01:50:00]  credible as a security guy.  Yeah.  So they keep me, let me have a job.  Dude, that's another thing.  Now, there's over-pitching, and then there's stuff that needs to be said.  Like, Kenny is an amazing security guard.  The best.  The best of the best.  He's like a superhero.  Right.  He's a stupor hero.  But he's also really good in his own way on the radio show. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  For some reason...  You're not allowed to mix that.  They don't really want him doing both.  And that doesn't make sense either.  Which is a problem.  Everything is a problem.  Stop overthinking everything.  He's an amazing security guard.  He knows when to be serious.  Trust me, he knows when to be serious.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of our fans have seen the serious side of Kenny, and it's not fun.  It's frightening when he's serious.  It's not fun.  And then he's able to step out of that, come in here, and be a goofball. 
[01:51:00]  It's perfect for us.  A goof.  It's perfect.  Everyone relax and let us do our thing.  And trust me, you will have a very popular show to sell.  Really?  An extremely popular show.  Don't overthink things.  The lawyer's got to leave us alone.  Yep.  Let us just do what we know what to do.  Because we know.  Go to attorneys.  Because we're us.  No.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we go to a break here? 
[01:51:30]  I'm going to play the fabulous Moolah story from yesterday.  Moolah.  The Iron Sheik.  Remember the fabulous Moolah?  Of course.  He had some nice things to say about it.  That was sweet of him.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  After the break, we do kosher sports with intern David.  We might be losing in the very near future.  We've got Judah Friedlander.  I believe he's here.  And we have the motivational speaker, Sean Stevenson, coming in studio today.  He's a mess in a wheelchair, but it just doesn't matter because he's a very inspirational guy. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Is that what he does?  Yeah.  Go for him.  After you hear him, you're not going to be like boo-hoo, boo-hoo.  No?  About yourself.  No.  Okay.  Look what the guy's been able to do with what God gave him.  We'll see.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Are we going to be tough critics?  Yes, we are.  Don't expect special treatment because you're one foot two inches tall and you come in rolling  around here.  Let's get to it.  How many pages is this book? 
[01:52:30]  He wrote a book called Get Off Your Butt, but he spelled it B-U-T.  So it's called How to End Self-Sabotage and Stand Up for Yourself.  Oh, I get it.  Get off your butt.  Like, yeah.  Oh, you want to do that?  Yeah, but.  Yeah, but.  Oh, I get it.  Because he really kind of can't.  Yeah.  But I still want to read it.  I mean, I don't want to read it, but I'll peruse it.  I don't get the motivational speaker thing.  Why?  Like, can't you just come up with the shit in your own head?  Yeah, I mean.  Like, you go like, um, I think everybody knows, like, yeah, I should do this. 
[01:53:00]  I should do that.  What, you need someone to kind of push you?  I think so.  Yeah?  It makes you at least think about it.  If you like something, you'll do it.  True.  Well, you can ask him that very question when he comes in.  I will.  Don't worry.  We'll keep it fun.  Sounds like some kind of convention we're about to go into.  Eh, fuck it.  We'll make it fun.  Boy, the Red Sox got a shellacking yesterday.  Culture sports next.  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  But first, the Iron Sheik talking about Moolah, the fabulous Moolah.  Hey, Iron Sheik, would you rather fuck Eric in the ass or the fabulous Moolah?  Oh, jeez.  Both of them doesn't work the shits, no.  God bless him.  I don't talk behind the Moolah.  She didn't like my smoke in the car.  I smoke him.  Greg the Hammer, myself, we give the Moolah right in California.  She come in the car, and I smoke the marijuana.  Greg the smoke the marijuana. 
[01:54:00]  I'm fabulous Moolah.  I said, Sheik, I don't like that shit in the car.  I said, oh, yeah?  You don't like my marijuana?  Greg, stop the car.  Get the fuck out of the car.  So, after that, I tell her, keep your fucking Moolah shot or take a hitchhawk to the show.  So, and then, she's an old lady.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Busy, busy show. 
[01:54:30]  Where's Judah Freelander, by the way?  Judah.  Judah and her.  He could be way down that hall.  I don't know.  You don't even know.  I know.  I can barely see anything.  How obnoxious, Jimmy, is the bathroom being so far away?  Because, Anthony, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think you might be a cyborg or something.  The fucking guy sits in that chair for four straight hours, doesn't get up once.  I'm like the Iron Sheik.  You don't stretch your legs.  I just piss my pants.  You don't stretch your legs.  Nothing.  You just sit.  No, no.  You don't see me do this all the time?  What do you do?  I go.  Oh, you do a little back bend thing? 
[01:55:00]  And then my legs are straight out right now.  And then I point my toes back and forth.  Yeah.  And then I, like, squish, you know?  I do some flexing moves there.  And then rotate the ankles.  But you do the same exercise as our motivational speaker does.  You never get out of your chair.  You don't, like, walk a little bit, check out the view.  This is a nice view about 20 feet away from our studio of...  I'm not a view guy.  Midtown, Tide Square, the Hudson River. 
[01:55:30]  As soon as we go to break, Jimmy and I can't wait to get out that door and start the long  fucking trek to the bathroom.  I know.  Well, you guys shit like fucking horses and cattle.  Shit and pee.  Yeah.  You guys just shit all over the place.  I made them.  Like monkeys.  I made them small dogs.  Yeah.  I made a big mistake today.  What happened?  Like, eh, a little irregular today.  Uh-oh.  Which way?  Which way?  Usually by showtime, I got three and me already done.  Today, not so much. 
[01:56:00]  And then I was able to squeeze a little something, something out, right?  And that just created logs just falling, falling, falling.  And now everything wants out of me.  Oh, shit.  That's bad.  That's a bad one.  You don't like this talk, do you?  No, I don't mind it.  It's kind of like the logs for all you Pacific Northwesters.  You know, you see the logs in the river, but then all of a sudden there's a little jam.  A log jam.  And you just see the logs just piling up and not going anywhere. 
[01:56:30]  But then you get rid of that jam, and next thing you know, everything starts flowing  and wants to go downriver fast.  I've learned to just not rush things.  Like, if I feel, because there have been times I'm like, I think I got to take in time.  I think so.  Let me go in there and give it a try.  It's nothing but trouble.  You got to wait until you're like, I got to take a shit.  When you know.  Yeah.  Then everything comes out nice.  There's no pushing and grunting.  Can we see a picture of your logs?  No. 
[01:57:00]  Never?  No, I'm not a photograph my log kind of guy.  I show, Jimmy shows, Danny shows.  He doesn't want to see the cum at the tips of them.  Why even fucking push and strain, man?  What I do is I actually just wait until I have to go.  I just shit my pants and it goes right into the washer.  It's so much easier.  I just shit like stew in your washing machine.  I look like fucking Davey about to fling the giant sling full of duty.  Fucking just shit my pants and wash it. 
[01:57:30]  The boys came up with a good pickup today.  Unless it was either you or Jimmy that came up with it.  But we're going old school.  Doing a little English office to prepare ourselves for the motivational speaker that's coming in at 9 o'clock.  Oh, is that fantastic?  I love that episode.  We were just watching it last weekend.  That is my favorite episode of the English drama.  Get out.  Get out.  They're just sitting there.  Like, look, man.  Yeah?  Leave us alone.  Yeah?  He's got the awful fucking tucked in t-shirt.  Tucked in t-shirt. 
[01:58:00]  The backwards hat.  And he throws the hat right into our face.  What a fool.  It's fantastic.  Get out.  Get out.  And there goes Danny.  It was such a bad emotional...  It was supposed to have an impact.  Like, whoa.  It was such a dud.  People just look at him like,  What?  Like, he thought they were going to be scared.  Like, all right.  Maybe I should get out.  What does he mean?  What does he mean by this?  He's being so weird and...  Yeah?  Yeah?  Get out.  Reaping the rewards.  Well, sorry. 
[01:58:30]  Reaping the rewards.  There's David Brent.  He's successful, yeah?  He's reaping the rewards.  Yeah?  You know, and you...  You know, maybe...  You know, you're 30...  In your 30s.  Yeah, you're 30.  In your 30s.  Just so fucking...  So good.  He's got...  He's such a non-impact.  We're going to have a...  Yeah, it's non-impact.  We're going to have a few clips from that episode in a few minutes, and then we can really  get into it.  Danny's been pushing this for the show all week, and I think we should play it. 
[01:59:00]  The Mike Tyson thing?  It might be a little old now, but...  Yeah, a little bit, yeah.  Mike Tyson...  Mike Tyson clears up the Chris Brown-Rihanna situation.  Yeah, he just goes on and rambles on about the whole Chris...  And then, you know, he likens it to his own situations, which he's had in the past.  But rape?  And punching a bitch.  Ah, right?  Let's hear Mike Tyson's take on this whole thing.  I have to ask, what's through your head when you see someone like Chris Brown, this whole  recent thing, Chris Brown?  You know what I say about that? 
[01:59:30]  It's none of my business, but you know what I say about that?  I understand the situation.  I understand passionate, you know what I mean?  Passion with young kids.  I understand, you know what I think, my personal opinion, about this...  He's just a baby.  He's just a little baby that don't know how to handle his emotions when it comes to a woman.  And he probably hears this and says, I know how to handle my emotions.  We all think we do.  But the fact that, you know what I mean, we look at this person and we might be crazy and 
[02:00:00]  loved by him.  We don't know how to handle those feelings.  Most people who are 40 don't know how to handle that feeling.  They kill their wives because they're thinking they're sick, but I don't want no way else to  have her.  I don't want no way to have that feeling that I possess of her.  I don't want to get that...  And it's just something that, either this way, you know?  Before in life, you were taught, this is my wife.  Society teaches us, we die and kill for our wives and our kids.  And nowadays we live, now you're a fly guy, you're a cool guy when you got that mentality 
[02:00:30]  like they played with something like this, pit mentality.  I don't care about her, you know what I mean?  Now that makes you cool, you know what I mean?  If you can control your feelings, not to care, not to let a woman invade your mind, then  you're a cool man.  You have to be hard like that and say, I don't care about no women.  Women don't mean nothing to me.  I got a bunch of women.  Women come diamond with them.  That makes you cool now in this society.  But still in all, you can't abuse them.  You know what I mean?  It's just really sick of what we do.  He's 100% right.  He really is. 
[02:01:00]  He made complete and perfect sense.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, I was expecting something way different.  From that.  But, yeah, he actually knows exactly what the fuck was going on in that situation.  I think the older, more mature Mike Tyson has a little wisdom from his youth.  He's picked up on some of that shit.  He understands because he was the guy punching his fucking wife in the face. 
[02:01:30]  He gets to that.  Oh, really?  Oh.  So if we stop here, Mike Tyson looks really good and smart.  He looks intelligent.  Kind of, yeah.  But now if we play the second clip, it all falls apart?  Yeah, there's just one more clip, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you want to beat your girlfriend up?  No.  Do you get mad angry at your girlfriend?  Yes.  Why do you get angry at her?  But she has a space in your heart and she invaded your mind in which you believe you care  about her more than anybody in the world.  And you believe I can do things to her but nobody else can do things to her. 
[02:02:00]  And it's really complex than human beings.  I mean, I think a lot of people, though, would say that that is, I mean, almost excusing the  behavior to say too young to say that she, you know, gets into his heart too much.  I mean, at the end of the day, it's right or wrong to hit somebody, obviously.  And see, it was that way 20 years ago, but it wasn't as extreme 20 years ago as it is  now.  It's just about who's making the rules and who's stamping that paper.  And that's what it, do I think it's right to beat up on a woman? 
[02:02:30]  No.  Hell no.  Have I violated and hit a woman before?  Hell yeah.  Was it wrong?  Hell yeah.  You know what I mean?  But that's the, I'm a product of that environment.  Hell yeah.  Well, what did he say about his wife?  He punched her and he said it was one of the best punches he ever threw.  And that was, you've seen some of the punches he's thrown in the ring.  He considered it one of the best punches he ever threw and it was in her face. 
[02:03:00]  What was her name?  Robin Givens.  Robin Givens.  Punched her right in the mug.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, B.A.  What the hell's wrong with Tyson?  He almost sounds like a man in this clip.  Yeah, his voice isn't as high, right?  Really, Tyson?  Yeah.  Wait a minute, guys.  All right.  Yeah, his voice isn't as high.  Yeah, he used to talk a lot higher. 
[02:03:30]  Now we fall down here.  Now he sounds like Blair's cousin Jerry.  I guess he's off the Zoloft.  Yeah.  I'd keep from killing y'all.  Tell me later, Mike.  Watching Tyson.  Yeah.  Tyson clips on YouTube.  Fantastic.  Old Tyson clips.  I don't like watching the ones where he's...  Who is that?  McNeely?  Was that Peter McNeely?  I don't know.  What a shit fight.  Big white dope.  Nice.  Getting a little ring with fucking Tyson. 
[02:04:00]  He fought a lot of big white dopes.  Yeah.  Just for a goof, I think.  All right.  Mr. Pryor was talking about Jerry Quarry one time.  It just made me laugh so hard.  He said something about Jerry Quarry's fight.  And he goes, Jerry Quarry loves getting beat up by niggers.  It just made me laugh so fucking hard.  It was such a funny thing to say.  And Quarry loved it.  Oh, Jesus.  If you haven't seen Mike Tyson clips in a while, go to YouTube.  Do yourself a favor. 
[02:04:30]  I just don't see...  Oh, man.  I just don't see bonkers like this anymore.  Oh, is he just pounding this guy?  The ref's trying to get in, and Tyson just keeps hitting him.  He just went to a place when he was fighting.  Look at this.  Oh, damn.  He knocked the ref down.  Was he just qualified for that?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know.  I got to research that.  I have no idea.  Yeah, that's like young Tyson there or something.  Right?  Now the guy's hitting Tyson.  Tyson's having a conversation with the ref. 
[02:05:00]  Like the guy is hitting Tyson.  Tyson's just having a conversation with the ref.  It did nothing to him.  A body shot knocked people out.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Tyson's holding him up now.  He's holding him up with his punches.  That guy's not going down, though, man.  No.  The ref's trying to get in there and stop the fight.  The guy is easily 6'5".  Tyson's hitting way up to try to get him.  Just around the ref.  God.  Damn.  Yeah, he tried to get around the ref to punch the guy in the head. 
[02:05:30]  And now the guy's just talking to the ref.  The other guy decides he might start punching Tyson.  Tyson's having a conversation.  Hey, what's up with the Tyson movie?  I don't know.  I want to get him in for that.  I think it's a good movie.  Yeah?  That's all I got on it.  It looks funny?  I'd like to know more is what I'm saying.  Is it a documentary on Tyson or?  I don't know. 
[02:06:00]  If someone knows a little something on the Tyson movie, give us a call, please.  I think it is.  All right.  The Office.  The English Office.  No, Tyson plays a guy who's revealing all of his girlfriends.  It's like a Matthew McConaughey film.  Except he raped something.  Put those two movies together and now you're talking.  The Matthew McConaughey and the...  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  You stayed hit when Mike hit you.  Oh, my God.  The guy got knocked down three times from one knockdown.  You think his friends laughed at him for that?  What's funny, the guy got up and then fell back down and was so pissed that he was so fucked up. 
[02:06:30]  You see where he got angry at himself?  Yeah, because he could not stand back up.  He got knocked down.  He goes to get up.  Go back a little, Dan.  I want to see the punch that actually put the guy down.  He goes to get up and...  Oh!  That short fucking punch he had.  Watch how pissed he gets at himself because he can't get up.  Watch.  He goes to get up.  He falls through the ropes.  Right here.  Gets up again.  And then gets mad at himself.  And falls sideways.  Yeah.  It's like someone spun him around 20 times and let him go to try to walk. 
[02:07:00]  Is this Michael Spinks?  That looks like Ken Norton.  We're watching him.  Oh, yeah.  Ken Norton might be up.  Did he find Ken Norton?  I think so.  Holy shit.  If he did.  Wait, did he?  I don't know.  That guy kind of looks like Ken Norton.  It might be Michael Spinks.  Oh, my.  No, it's around six.  It could be Michael Spinks.  Tyson was fucking devastating, man.  Just devastating.  I have watched boxing the same way since Tyson.  No.  No one has.  He was the last of the last fucking fighters that you went, I got to see this guy.  But he wasn't fighting any guys. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not taking it away from Tyson.  But I think, like they said, guys that hit like Ernie Shavers.  You know what it is, though?  He wasn't in a phase in his career, unfortunately, where there were a lot of really good boxers at his weight class.  Like Foreman, I think.  A younger Foreman would have hurt Tyson.  I think.  Holy shit.  That fucking left hand is amazing.  Tyson was good.  He was a very quick boxer.  He would dunk and then had that devastating uppercut with his legs.  That's Larry Holmes. 
[02:08:00]  I strongly suggest you just go to Tyson Knockouts somewhere on the whip.  Yeah, he was really a rough fucking puncher.  Just killing people.  Let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Good evening.  You're representing at least 20 phone calls right now because everybody's calling about the same thing.  So do it justice.  What do you know on the Tyson film?  Well, basically, I saw it online yesterday.  And it's way more psychological than just his physical fights. 
[02:08:30]  It goes into who he is as a person, what he did.  It goes into his relationships, his kids.  It was just really eye-opening.  Was it good?  Oh, it was unbelievable.  I couldn't stop walking it.  Oh, fuck.  His peak right here.  Yeah, when Tyson was young.  Fucking five.  Look at it.  You didn't even see that punch.  That motherfucker's on the ground.  Yeah, Tyson had a fucking...  He was a squat.  But people say he was a much better boxer than he got credit for.  Like, he's a faster puncher.  Dude, he's picking his shots on that guy. 
[02:09:00]  Like, here, you stand there.  I'm just going to punch you in the face.  You know what?  He wasn't that much past his prime when he lost to Buster.  He wasn't that much past his prime.  That's why you think, like...  That was more of a psychological thing, I think.  Yeah.  Holyfield.  When he lost to Buster Douglas.  There's certain guys Tyson's couldn't be.  He probably never beat Holyfield because of Holyfield's boxing style.  Yeah.  I think Tyson was great, but historically, a lot of guys would have beat the shit out of him.  You really think so?  Ali beat Sonny Liston. 
[02:09:30]  He absolutely would have beat him.  You think Ali could take a punch that Tyson's doing?  Oh, my God.  That motherfucker...  I know Ali was able to take a punch.  Dude, he fought Ken Norton with a broken jaw.  And he fought Foreman, who had an evil fucking...  Yeah, he took fucking, like, five or six rounds of Foreman pounding him.  You're right.  You're right.  And Frazier.  People would try to hold on.  People would actually try to clinch onto Tyson, and he'd just punch them in the face.  Yeah.  He's like, fuck that.  You ain't holding on to me, motherfucker.  Ali would have frustrated him.  He would have held him.  Ali just would have kept grabbing him and then jabbing him on the way out.  Ali was an infuriating fighter. 
[02:10:00]  Something tells me this guy is standing up for much longer.  No, he couldn't be.  There he goes.  Wow.  Whenever you're on a Tyson YouTube clip, you have about ten seconds left on camera.  Yeah, that's it.  There's never going to be a long period of time.  There's just ten seconds of notoriety, asshole.  Find a Michael Spinks win.  That's the best thing.  It was a championship fight when Tyson was wanting to become the champion.  And it was 90 seconds.  Why isn't Tyson doing interviews for this movie?  Maybe he's only doing TV.  I don't know.  God damn it.  I would love to have Tyson in here.  I think he was offered to us once. 
[02:10:30]  No way.  We never would have said no.  Who would say no to Mike Tyson?  Or they asked us, would you like Tyson?  Oh, well, probably in the same breath as, you know.  I remember that some kind of Tyson conversation went down.  And we might have passed on the director.  I don't know.  He just tried to pick up my wife, you know.  But he didn't know she was your...  Before I was married.  It's a major womanizer.  Scumbag, actually.  Fucking hate the dude.  Oh, yeah.  Here's the Tyson Spinks.  Jesus. 
[02:11:00]  What a fucking...  He came right in just killing him.  Yeah, he really went right after Michael Spinks.  Michael wanted no part of fighting him either.  No.  Uh-uh.  Right now, we're watching this fight in real time.  This is what we were talking about.  It just started.  And Mike's already giving him a beating.  How he stood up this that long.  Somebody is pissing right now in this arena who had good tickets.  And they're going to make it back.  And fucking Tyson has a belt on.  Yeah.  Someone's getting a hot dog.  When you said someone's pissing, I thought you meant Michael Spinks.  No.  You see it on his face like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  He just wants to have the dignity of going into round two. 
[02:11:30]  I thought you saw the Iron Sheik in the crowd.  The Iron Sheik is in there.  Just, I have to take a piss.  The pay-per-views were ridiculous after a while.  Because you'd get him and watch the undercards, maybe.  They'd have this big, long bio on both guys.  And then this fight was over.  Tyson is just fucking pounding.  He wants his belt badly.  Do you think they got to Tyson, too, and said, look, you've got to kind of hang in there a few rounds.  That's right.  Wow, he put him down with a body blow right there.  Yeah.  And Michael Spinks is like, all right.  Punch to the stomach, knocked him down. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, Spinks is like, all right, I'm still good.  All right.  He's like, oh, what the fuck am I doing here?  I'm good.  He goes, what am I doing here?  Boom.  Flat on his back.  One punch later, he's on his back.  He looks like fucking Steve Harvey, actually.  With that big mouthpiece, looks like those big Steve Harvey teeth.  Yeah, Michael's attempting to get up, and he's watching his belt just go away.  That's it.  And he tries to get up, and he falls through the ropes.  And that was that.  That was Kevin Rooney hugging him.  What a day in history that was. 
[02:12:30]  Custom Auto was already dead, I think.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah, but after Kevin Rooney left, I think that's when Tyson's crew.  Rooney?  When he went completely with Don King.  I think that was when he just completely lost his good training and began to go down the toilet.  Let's say hi to Tom on Long Island.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hi, Tom.  How are you, Tom?  Hi, thank you.  Yeah, I heard a comparison in the 90s.  It said getting hit by Tyson was like putting a phone book against your head.  Like Babe Ruth, take a heck out of it.  Ooh, that would hurt.  Yeah.  That's all I got, guys. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he's a fucking amazing puncher, dude.  I don't think there are many people that Tyson couldn't have knocked out if he hit him right.  But a lot of those guys in the 70s, and I'm not just glorifying the older days,  but they could take a punch, man.  You know, they could take a punch, but they were a little more lumbering back then than Tyson.  Tyson was a fast fucking guy for his weight.  Yeah, but Joe Frazier, Joe Frazier fought like that.  He was fucking a squat, powerful fucking ducking hard to hit guy.  Yeah.  But these guys just didn't go down in the first and second round. 
[02:13:30]  I mean, the majority of times, Frazier Ali went the distance.  Went the distance, yeah.  Fucking went the distance with Ken Norton, went eight rounds with Foreman.  They'd come out at the end of that fight for the announcement of the winner.  Just beat to shit, both of them.  It's amazing.  Back in the good old days of boxing, now it's, you know, UFC.  It's all about UFC.  I can't even watch these guys, and I'm thinking of Fedor just grabbing their legs and tapping  them in eight seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like...  Fucking, there's the Buster Douglas.  Amazing.  Oh, that was Buster knocking him out? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Tenth round, right?  That was hard to watch.  Yeah, it really was.  Wow.  Because it was like, my God, how is fucking Mike Tyson getting knocked down?  And he put his fucking...  Sorry, he put his mouthpiece in backwards.  Yeah.  Yeah, the place went nuts.  Let's say hi to Seth.  I'm going out.  Seth.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, buddy?  No, Mark, I actually caught the filmmaker on Morning Joe a couple days ago, and they  showed how women who would normally sing Tyson of a big, big white beater, after seeing 
[02:14:30]  the documentary, walked out with a newfound respect for him, actually.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, amazing to me, you know, because he has a babbling fucking moron.  He did go to prison for rape.  Yeah.  All right, well, obviously, we got a newfound respect for the rapist.  All right, thank you, sir.  Yeah, we can talk about Tyson for another 20 minutes, but we got a lot going on on the  show today.  Sean Stevenson is here.  Judah's late, but Sean is here.  Yeah, we're going to get him in a sec.  Let's get kosher sports done.  Yeah, bring in our Jewish friend. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, as Sean Stevenson makes his way into the studio.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's...  Boy.  Intern David.  My son, David.  We haven't done kosher sports in a while.  We might be losing, David.  David.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, David.  What's the matter, David?  Nothing's wrong at all.  No.  We heard you...  Whoa!  We heard there's a problem.  Well, yeah.  What problem is that?  What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Yeah, what problem did you hear?  He hates being touched.  Well, I don't touch him.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  He made that snarling with his mouth.  Like a dog does.  Danny surprisingly touched him on the back.  Yeah, and I find out if he knows it's coming, it's not so bad, but...  Yeah.  You gotta get him when he doesn't know it's coming.  And then he goes...  A dog does that, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, why do you snarl if someone touches you, not even confrontationally?  Like if someone just taps you, like...  I don't know.  I really don't know.  It's just a reaction.  Okay.  I don't like being touched.  You don't feel threatened, though?  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  No, no, no, no.  Now, I hear you might be leaving.  I mean...  Leaving?  Whoa! 
[02:16:00]  Oh, he's doing his catchphrase, everybody.  His catchphrase.  Yes, you're hearing the rumors, yes.  No, there's not many rumors, really.  No, there's not much of a buzz.  It's called, are you leaving?  Yeah.  And it's not just me.  It's all the interns.  Whoa, no way.  Yeah, all the interns, including the 39-year-old intern.  Wow.  And the swiveling...  Well, not the swiveling.  The 39-year-old intern would have to leave, too.  Like some of the interns that only did one semester... 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  They can't come back for a second semester because they went to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting  and that school's gone, so they can't get any credits to come back for another semester.  So why don't they find another broadcasting school or school and then they don't have an internship?  Well, they've got to pay more money to go to another school.  Oh.  I think bitch hips is the one you're talking about.  Yeah.  No, but bitch hips, the one with the hips doesn't...  I don't think he has to worry because he, with an okay school, let's say, didn't business.  So, bishops...  Yeah, he can come back.  You have to come back, David.  But I can't come back because I did two semesters, right? 
[02:17:00]  And seriously, no more.  You'd be a guest.  Said no more.  Would you want to stay here for free?  I don't know.  For free?  Oh, Jesus.  I was...  Spoken like a true J.  Look at his...  Yeah, really.  Then hit the bricks, fucking sister.  You've got to know where he came from, O.  Oh, well...  Yeah, for free.  We don't have money for you yet.  Oh.  Yeah, I would want to come back, yeah.  With all due respect, David, take a hike and then there's another word.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's...  I've been looking...  Guess who that's from? 
[02:17:30]  Steve from Bayshore.  I've been looking at the instant feedback.  I've been reading it.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are going to miss you, right?  Is that what it's saying?  It's mixed.  There's mixed reviews.  For everyone...  I like you, David.  There's 2,000.  Get away.  If everyone hatred, there's one disinterest and apathy.  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the people on instant feedback are asking for a certain former intern to come back.  Who?  Have you guys been reading the... 
[02:18:00]  No!  They're asking for Mr. Pat Duffy to come back.  We love Pat.  Really?  They're saying, I don't want David to come back.  I want Pat Duffy to come back.  Pat Duffy's still...  That was Danny Arn in Manhattan.  Pat Duffy's still number one intern of all time on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Still number one of all time.  That was back in the day when you could intern for as long as you wanted.  That's right.  Now you can't.  Way back.  Way back in the day.  Now only two semesters and then you gotta go.  You're out.  Yeah.  Why is that?  I'm really not sure. 
[02:18:30]  It's something that Sirius came up with when the merger happened.  Yeah.  Why didn't you ask?  Like, why is that, sir?  Why only two semesters?  If we're working out well...  Maybe they want to give other potential interns a chance to intern.  Boo.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Hoping I'm going to get yelled at for saying that.  Maybe they want to get rid of the interns before they get lackadaisical and they want  a new bunch in here that are going to, you know, snap to it and...  Maybe.  ...step and fetch it kind of a thing. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah.  What are you saying?  They don't want lackluster performances?  Yes.  Lackluster.  Don't give a lackluster performance, David.  Well, David, if the show was going to hire you, how much money would you ask for?  Uh, what are they...  What can they...  How much can they provide?  I don't know.  That's not the way you negotiate it.  No.  How much do you want to continue with the show?  If they were going to pay me, I'd want a good, like, yearly salary.  Like, a good, like, 30,000, 35,000 to start off. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yes.  35 grand?  Yeah, to start off.  Yeah, sure.  Mm-hmm.  That'd be enough for me to get going, yeah.  Well, good luck to you.  What do you make now?  I don't make any...  I don't have money right now.  So you want to go from making zero money...  Yeah.  ...in any capacity.  You don't make any money at, like, a side job?  Yeah, I have a part-time minimum wage job.  Oh, okay.  So what are you clearing, and what do you do?  Oh, we've talked about this before.  I work at a...  Did we? I forgot.  I work at a box office at a theater.  I just, like, sell tickets, and I answer phones and customer service work. 
[02:20:00]  I don't remember talking to him about that.  Oh, yeah.  I've mentioned it a couple of times.  And people joke around that I sell tickets.  How much do you make?  Minimum wage.  Minimum wage?  Yeah.  What's minimum wage these days?  That's, like, eight...  I make, like, eight dollars.  Damn.  And how much are we...  Why can't we hire Dave for eight bucks an hour?  $2.50 an hour.  That's good minimum wage.  Let's do kosher sports with David, because we've got the motivational speaker standing by.  He's waiting, yeah.  He's not standing by.  How does he look there?  Yeah, he's not standing by.  No, he's not.  I haven't even seen him. 
[02:20:30]  I haven't even seen the guy.  Whoa.  All right, kosher sports with intern David.  Let's do it, David.  All right.  Yep.  There we go.  Hi.  Hey.  All right, ready?  Yes.  All right.  A big boker tove to all my sports fans.  I'm Big Dick Day with the return of the kosher sports report.  Have you been following the NBA playoffs?  In the Bulls-Celtics series, there have been a total of seven overtimes so far. 
[02:21:00]  Oiga Volt, the wear and tear on my TV.  Get it?  Seven overtimes?  Yes.  That's why we laugh.  That's why we laugh.  Blaine's it.  Yes.  That's why we laugh.  Yes.  All right.  You get a laugh.  That means people get it.  Yep.  Why would they be wear and tear, though?  Because there was a long playoff series.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Good.  Good one.  Yep.  All right.  There is a new book coming out about A-Rod. 
[02:21:30]  Allegedly, from his steroid use, he has bitch tits, which are giving me a rod.  He makes me proud to be a Jew, because it is also alleged that he is a chief tipper at Hooters.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's what you're saying about A-Rod, yeah.  Yeah.  Shouldn't you have said, which is giving me a rod?  Yes.  A rod.  Instead of a rod.  A rod.  Yes.  A rod.  See, because the joke is A-Rod.  Yes.  A rod. 
[02:22:00]  But you said a rod.  I screwed up.  A rod.  I screwed up.  A rod.  Yes.  All right.  All right, kid.  Ah, you know.  Yep.  That darn A-Rod.  Language.  Yeah.  Oh, it sounded like good.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  All right.  In other sports news, the hockey playoffs are going on.  Wouldn't it be funny to have a Hasidic hockey team?  Ha, ha, ha, gosh.  The way they dress is good padding and good for the cold. 
[02:22:30]  And I would love to see a few Paises pulled out during a fight.  Oh, could you imagine that?  Wouldn't it be funny?  It was probably not the operative term.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pais hitting the ice instead of the gloves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that?  How about that?  Yep.  That's hockey for you.  That sure is.  Yep.  Wow, this is going well.  All right.  In other sports news, there is a big boxing match tomorrow night in Las Vegas.  Is there?  Yes, there is. 
[02:23:00]  Ricky Hatton, who is an English man, is going to be fighting Manny Pacquiao, who is a Filipino.  A lot of Jews don't box, but they sure know how to take advantage of and exploit other nationalities.  Get it?  Jews are annoying.  Is this supposed to be a bit that makes us not feel so bad about losing David?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, really?  Yes.  How many more stories you got there?  One more.  Attaboy, David.  All right.  Those were all... 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  And finally, this weekend is the Kentucky Derby.  There are some interesting horses running this Sabbath.  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  I'd like to see Mr. Hot Stuff win.  He sure is sexy.  You know what bothers me about horse racing?  When a horse loses, how come the horse never gets the blame?  Why don't they blame the little fella on the horse's back?  Ah, right?  Why do they blame?  Yeah, you said why don't they blame. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, why do they blame?  No.  No, why don't they blame them?  You said the horse doesn't get the blame.  They do blame.  You said the horse doesn't get the blame.  No, no, listen.  I'll read it again.  No, no, no.  We got it.  We got it.  And finally, the Kentucky Derby is this weekend.  We said no.  No, I haven't got it.  We got it.  There are some interesting horses running this Sabbath.  We said no.  We got it.  It's Shawn Stevenson.  I'm glad that...  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, when a horse loses...  No, we already said we got it.  You don't have to repeat it.  He's a motivational speaker.  I'm trying to explain to Anthony because he's confused.  He's not confused.  You're confused.  Okay, how am I confused? 
[02:24:30]  Because you said the horse...  Why don't they blame...  The horse.  The horse.  Yes, that's what I meant to say.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then you said...  Why don't they blame the horse?  They should blame...  Why don't they blame the person on the back of the horse?  See, you just did it again.  You go, why don't they blame the horse?  No, why didn't they blame the horse?  Why don't they blame the person on the back of the horse?  Why don't they blame the person on the back of the horse?  Are you saying why don't they twice?

[02:28:00]  Jim Norton  who's going to be on Letterman tonight  let's not forget about that  remember you're the best  and in the studio  Sean Stevenson  how's it going guys  hey buddy  good man  he's a motivational speaker  he's a  I know you hate the term  motivational speaker  it makes me a little bit nauseous  yeah  it should  it is atrocious  but  wait what makes you nauseous about that  well when we think of motivation  we think of positive thinking  and we think of pie in the sky  tell yourself you're good enough  you're strong enough  like Stuart Somali from Senate Live 
[02:28:30]  it really doesn't have the impact  and that's not what I do  I'm a very realistic human being  that calls it out  if you're doing something to your life  that's causing it to fail  I can point that out  and help you turn it around  but until you're willing to  get real with something  you're just going to keep repeating your past  and okay  so yeah  not a motivational speaker  what would you consider yourself  just a realistic  a motivator by example  well I'm a psychotherapist  so about eight years ago  I've been speaking for 13 years professionally  and then about eight years ago  people started coming out of my audience 
[02:29:00]  with major challenges  and pulling me aside  you know  kids would say  I'm cutting myself  or people would say  you know  I think my dad's suicidal  and it'd be really heavy stuff  and they'd say  you know  what do I do  well as a professional speaker  I wasn't trained  to clinically respond to that  I couldn't give them  a little metaphor  to help them with that  you know  so I realized  I had to go back to school  and become a professional listener  and then for about the past eight years  I've also been a therapist  but my therapy is interesting  because it's called full immersion  where I see a client  for 12 hours in a row 
[02:29:30]  and then never again  no  yeah  that cannot be true  it's an amazing experience  why never again  well it's not that  I won't speak to them ever again  it's just the issue  and stay out  he gets all the dirty secrets  and then says  get out you filth bag  not really  but we'll let it play  but who can hang out  for 12 straight hours  well it's intense  because what happens is  I believe you shouldn't  mortgage your pain  over time  and any therapy  that works for somebody  I'm going on the record  and saying great  however the field  that I chose  was full immersion 
[02:30:00]  because I like the idea  of you and I  getting into a room  going into the depth  of what's beyond  that story  that you tell everybody  is your problem  and let's really  find that problem  and turn it around  and whatever skill  we have to give you  and I teach people  how their mind works  so they don't become  codependent upon me  where do you meet them  in your office  yeah we meet in my office  and we do certain things  like we call them  field trips  based on whatever  their challenges may be  and take them out  into the real world  oh so you do break it up  with like milk and cookies 
[02:30:30]  or beers or something  at least  you know we get outside  we get outside in the world  it's not like I locked  them into a room  with you know  no windows  and no lights  12 hours of pontificating  right  no it's realistic  we have a great time  but I have to unplug  them from their life  because the challenge  with most therapy  is you go in  you're there for an hour  and about 45 minutes  of that you're just  warming up to even  open your mouth  and tell somebody the truth  and then you got 15 minutes 
[02:31:00]  of the truth  and you're done  and then you gotta go  back to your life  and get all messed up again  based on what your scenario  is at home  or in your work life  whereas when I got you  for 12 hours in a row  you really have the time  to go past all that story  you get that 45 minute  warm up  and then the rest of the day  you get real with yourself  you're uh  what made you want to speak  and uh  and kind of  I mean I  I mean you're in a wheelchair  and people can't see you  on radio  would you consider yourself  people get so offended  at the word handicap  they change it  do you consider yourself 
[02:31:30]  handicapped  or how do you see yourself  you know  I have a physical condition  uh  but it's not what I identify with  you know  I've been called  handicapped  I've been called disabled  but let's like  let's look at the root word  of disabled  it means not able  well I've traveled  to 47 states  6 countries  filmed a fitness video  with Miss Fitness Universe  I like that one guys  and you know  written books  traveled the world  helping people  that doesn't sound not able  it's easy when you get  the good parking spaces  that's right  that's right  don't hate  participate  and um 
[02:32:00]  alright  so you became  a speaker  and what is  the challenges  you faced  like obviously  uh  people  do people  what is the most  annoying thing  about when people  see you  what is the biggest  misconception  about the way  people treat you  or talk to you  um  like what is the thing  that you just want to go  would you cut the shit  I'm just a guy  well  I believe we teach  people how to treat us  so I turn around  any condescending  or any negative behavior  that comes into my airspace  so I'm responsible  for you being comfortable 
[02:32:30]  with me  right  so when I show up  I'm very comfortable  in my own skin  so that you go  oh maybe I should  just treat him  like a regular guy  I'm not militant at all  because I find that  that doesn't work  if I'm like  hey treat me  like everybody else  well now you're  freaked out  you're freaked out  and you don't want  anything to do with me  and so what I do  is I just let people  know that  probably the biggest  misconception  before somebody  gets to meet me  is that they're  going to help me  that I'm helpless  and what they don't  realize is  I'm completing my PhD  I have a successful  business  and I got a great  dating life 
[02:33:00]  and my life is fine  so how can I help you  but how did you get  comfortable in your own skin  it took years  it took years  because you have  an unbelievable confidence  just sitting here  you're a very confident  human being  thank you  and you know  most people  you know what I'm trying  like I don't know  where did this come from  yeah how did you get  to this point  because most people  if they're a little short  or got some dumb  little thing  you're with them  they fall apart  sure  and you had some  big obstacles  well I got in front  of the right people  so I surrounded myself 
[02:33:30]  with amazing mentors  first of all  I was blessed to have  two great parents  something that  most of us  cannot say sadly  my parents were  a big part of that  they let me know  that my condition  did not define  who I am  what is your  it's called  osteogenesis imperfecta  also known as  brittle bones disorder  have you guys seen  the movie  Unbreakable  with Samuel L. Jackson  oh yeah  yeah  he was portraying  the character of somebody  who has my condition  he's supposed to have  a milder version  of my condition  so with my condition  by the time  it stunts the growth  of the bones  and it also makes 
[02:34:00]  my bones fragile  so as a child  something as simple  as sneezing  would break a collarbone  and by the age  by the age 18  I'd fractured  over 200 times  so I've had  tremendous amount  of pain  in my life  so throwing up  so you learned  to talk  so you didn't  have to fight  I don't play  that's why  you're a great talker  because you're like  I just don't  fucking throw a punch  I got it  smart man  that's right  you gotta make  friends with the  bigger guys  are you still  fracturing bones  as an adult  no my goodness  I started 
[02:34:30]  on a diet  and an exercise  program  that in the past  nine years  I haven't fractured  entirely  so we're very  fortunate from  that standpoint  but again  I teach in my book  and I teach in my lectures  that you have to be  responsible for your life  that means your body  how you keep care of it  you have to be  responsible for your  finances  for your relationships  you can't blame  other people  and growing up  I realized that  if I sat in this  wheelchair  and I blamed  everybody around me  for getting a better  life than I did  I was going to become 
[02:35:00]  more and more  withered  and not have an  impact on this planet  so I had to  take ownership  in this life  and I realized  that there's a lot  of things that I can't do  but there's a lot more  that I can do  now for the people  out there  how tall are you  and how much do you weigh  just so we got the visual  I'm three feet of pleasure  and 45 pounds  45 pounds  yeah because  there are people  of you know  average stature  that  just are complete  screw ups  so  I mean you've  accomplished 
[02:35:30]  a hell of a lot  and you know  I didn't graduate  high school  so  the definition  of misery  in my opinion  is  focusing on  what you don't have  don't like  and don't want  and that's not  where I ever  spend my time  I focus on  what I do have  do like  and do want  and I'm very much  a visionary  I see the pictures  that I want  in my life  to happen  and I then  create a life  around it  that makes it happen  I recently  was in Chicago  I threw out  the first pitch  in a major league  baseball game  and I did it  laying down  on the grass 
[02:36:00]  it was pouring  down rain  before they delayed  the game  and I threw out  a perfect strike  30 feet  I practiced it  for two months  scratched it  off my list  another thing  we put in the book  that I want to do  in my life  is get a television show  so we have one of those  coming out this fall  and go on a date  with Natalie Portman  so Natalie  you know how to reach me  and just out there  making the point  especially with the  first pitch  that you can either  live life in the stands  or you can live it  down on the field  and I live down  on the field in life 
[02:36:30]  and when you're down  on the field  everybody's watching  and they have  really high expectations  and you have a big  amount of responsibility  but it's a lot more fun  you get to do  a lot cooler things  down on the field  let me ask you a question  this is a protocol question  a courtesy question  we don't know  Gary Coleman was in  last week  we interviewed him  and we take pictures together  that's what we do  because we're starstruck idiots  and I want to ask  what is the proper way  because people  people in wheelchairs  get pissed off at you  if you don't do it right  and Gary's a short guy  are you supposed  I just stood there  with him and took the picture  well it all depends  on how comfortable  that person is 
[02:37:00]  in their own skin  you know  you could kneel down  to me  you could stand up  you could stand on a block  it wouldn't matter to me  because I knew who I am  unfortunately  there's a lot of people  who aren't as far along  in their comfortability  with their body  and so therefore  they are that militant  don't step down  and help me  you know sometimes  you'll see people  in wheelchairs  and they'll be like  I can do everything  on my own  and they're very angry  and that's where they are  in their progression in life  and the best thing  I always say is  just be honest with them  and say  hey what would make you  most comfortable  if I got down on your level 
[02:37:30]  if I stood up normally  what would make you comfortable  and whenever they say  you do the opposite  because you show them  that life is tough  that's right  that's right  give them the old  Richard Whitmark  what do you find  are people's  in today  like what do you find  people  something tells me  you would kick them  in the shin  or something  no I'm actually  the nicest guy  in this entire room  you wouldn't believe it  okay  yeah  they look like  nice guys  they're awful  what do you see  people  what do you see  people in this day and age  really kind of  that need help with 
[02:38:00]  that come to you  and say  hey this is  you know  the problem I'm having  what do you see most  the biggest thing I see  is people that  won't let go of their past  really  see you know something  I've always said  like people do seem  to just latch on to that  let it eat away at them  well here's why  human beings are addicted  to being right  and so when they  tell them  oh really  really  I think you're  wrong sir  now we are addicted  to being right 
[02:38:30]  now the question is  what are you proving  right in your life  I'm proving right  that I am  an attractive  powerful man  that's going to  change this planet  other people  in my condition  may prove  that they're  disabled  helpless  and they need  everyone to  feel sorry for them  it's a choice  and when people  come to me  they have a story  that they're  repeating  often times  in their head  of why they  don't have  what they want  in the last  chapter of the book  we talk about  you have a choice  you can either  live at cause  and you own  your life  or you're going  to live at a fact  and you blame  everybody  and when you  blame everybody 
[02:39:00]  you get off the  hook really quickly  but you're also  left alone  you're also  left miserable  most human beings  the reason why  people do all  the crazy things  from getting  addicted to  substances  to being  miserable  and depressed  deep down  inside  they don't  feel they have  what it takes  to succeed  in life  or that  something is  wrong with them  but isn't that  everybody's kind  of insecurity  everybody to a  point has that  oh god  I'm not  good enough  for that  or  you know  it's very hard  to have the confidence 
[02:39:30]  to know that you're  going to go in  somewhere and be a  success  you're always going  to have these  doubts  I would challenge you  and say it's a lot  harder to be miserable  because I have a  great life  oh yeah  believe me  I'm having a pisser  sure  but the thing is  you do have these  doubts when you go  into something  that you're not  good enough  I don't think  that's something  that needs  to be discussed  with a professional  but I think  that's just  basic human nature  unless it does  take that point  where you really  get carried away  with it and go  oh my god 
[02:40:00]  I'm a piece of  shit  you know  well it can't  get out of hand  no doubt  I mean depression  usually starts off  with sadness  right  and then it just  grows from there  what I intervene  is I let the  clients know  that they have  to recognize  what they're doing  in their behavior  because as long  as you are  oblivious to your  behavior  it'll just keep  repeating  and so you can't  change something  that you won't  acknowledge  when I come into  someone's life  I'm very clear  about what's  going on with  your life  what are you  currently doing  what do you not  have that you want 
[02:40:30]  and then we work  backwards from  what are you  believing about  yourself  it always comes  down to the  deeper structure  of the mind  that we can't  figure out  on our own  necessarily  it's odd  because you  bring up  things about  people's past  are usually  what affects  who they are  now  in this 12  hours  how hard  or easy  is it to get  to that point  and come up  with a solution  it's very difficult  if it's ingrained  in somebody  since they were  a kid  we have to  say you take  a CD  it's playing 
[02:41:00]  a song  in order to  get that CD  to never play  that song  again  you have to  take it out  of the machine  you have to  keep scratching  it until you  put it back  in and it won't  play again  the right way  if you scratch  it once  it'll skip  but it'll keep  playing  scratch it twice  it'll skip  a couple times  if you keep  scratching it  to the point  that it no  longer runs  that program  is done  in your mind  when clients  come to see me  we go in  and we fry  the circuits  of their  negative beliefs  of their  limitations  in their mind  so that it  never plays  again  so like  we had a  client come in  a young lady  gorgeous young lady 
[02:41:30]  who believed  that she was ugly  and we had to  go into her  mind and help  her realize  that those  beliefs that  she had  that was  making her  feel ugly  we had to  just use  a right amount  of therapeutic  logic  to fry it  so that it  never played  again  she just sent  me an email  this morning  saying I  just can't  believe how  good it feels  to be beautiful  again  I bet you  what he did  was he just  banged her  and he went  say you're  hot  something tells  me that the  licensing board  would not  approve  unethical  there Jim  Dr. Jim  unorthodox  I say  not unethical  and by the way 
[02:42:00]  your therapy  wouldn't be  12 hours  would be  5 minutes  32 seconds  I've been  therapy for  many years  and also  12 step  recovery  these two  slave to  the past  right here  I'm telling you  on my left  Anthony  adult child  of alcoholic  maybe we can  get into that  a little bit  while you're  here doc  the tapes  play  Anthony's a  brilliant guy  but you know  that's why  I was saying  everybody I  believe  has a  as they say  cross to bear 
[02:42:30]  it's how  you bear it  you can  you can  use your  past I  think to  your advantage  which I  have  I've used  and I  haven't had  this miserable  you know  past of  abuse or  anything like  that where  I've been  physically  abused  but there  has been  some issues  with you  know  a very  irresponsible  father  always  drinking  things like  that  well I  tell  people  your  parents  either  teach  you  what  to  do  in  life  or  they  teach  you  what  not  to  do  right  because  you hear  people say  oh my god  I'm never  going to raise  my kids 
[02:43:00]  like my parents  raised me  or some people  just fall right  into the same  cycle and do  the same thing  so you could  make a plus  out of your  negative past  by you know  this radio show  I've done that  on this show  using what  I've been  through  when I was  living out in  California  my dad  like I said  very irresponsible  this just  nightmare  horrors  that were  they were  horrific  when I was  a kid  but now  as you look  back  they're just  really great  stories to tell  to have people  go like  holy 
[02:43:30]  what  someone got  shot in the  middle of the  Mojave Desert  and you saw  this and  you know  there were just  these episodes  that were like  amazingly  one of my  one of my  buddies says  everything in  life is either  a great  a great moment  or a great  story  see that's  true  and that's  basically what  you just said  yeah  so you know  but obviously  there are people  that can't  deal with it  how do you  differentiate  between somebody  that can  and is  dealing well  with a negative  past  or isn't 
[02:44:00]  because  well here's  the difference  and I  we talk about  in the book  is that  you know  that the  person's  dealing  well  with it  if they're  getting the  results that  they want  out of their  life  the only reason  why a client  would ever  come see me  is if they're  not getting  the results  that they want  but I don't  think anybody  is completely  satisfied with  their lives  and I do believe  that there are a lot  of people out there  that are fulfilled  I being hopefully  one of these people  you know  doesn't mean  I don't want  more  of course  I want  more  right  right  it's human  nature  to want  to grow  and have  more  and do  more 
[02:44:30]  and try  more  things  however  it's not  human nature  it's human  suffering  that throughout  the process  you don't feel  good enough  throughout the  process  you don't feel  like you have  what it takes  and what  most human  beings do  to try to  feel good  is they  gratify  themselves  drugs  sex  alcohol  food  they choose  things that  give pleasure  in a split  second  now  what happens  is that  leaves you  hungry  leaves you  wanting to  do it  again  and you can  never get  that satiated  whereas if you  do things  that are 
[02:45:00]  fulfilling  then a human  being feels  that they have  a purpose  and fulfillment  only comes  through either  growing  so working  on yourself  personally  or in a  gym  or whatever  physically  or contribution  giving back  to others  you know  I've never  met somebody  that says  Sean I'm  sitting in  your office  and I spend  three days a  week  donating my  time to  a soup  kitchen  and then  four more  days at  a women's  abuse  shelter  and I'm  miserable  I never  find that  when human  beings  contribute their  time and  their energy  and their  resources  to the 
[02:45:30]  planet  or to  humanity  they find  a sense  of peace  inside of  them  that's  irreplaceable  and when  human beings  are miserable  they're usually  making their  whole life  all about  them  when we  focus on  ourselves  and we  just keep  thinking  why don't  I have  this  or why  am I  not that  and why  am I  not there  in life  yeah that  will lead  to suffering  because it's  all about  you  when you  realize  you're just  one little  thing in  a big  picture  then you  can have  connection  with the  planet  makes some  sense over  there  we got 
[02:46:00]  Shawn Stevenson  in studio  reset here  get off your  butt is the  name of the  book  how to end  self-sabotage  and stand up  for yourself  we got  questions  coming in  one about  Jimmy  is that  right  Jimmy  yeah of  course  fatty  pubis  fatty  pubis  high  fatty  pubis  yes  f-a-t-t-i-e  after our  buckle  I believe  I wanted to  open Pandora's  box here  and ask  the good  gentleman  there 
[02:46:30]  ask him  about  relationships  and why  he sabotages  every single  relationship  he has  so why  do you  sabotage  and go  I don't  know  I just  tend to  do it  I think  part of  it is  I like  the challenge  I don't  think I want  the girl  sometimes as  much as I  think I do  once you have  somebody  it's almost  like I look  for things  outside myself  to feel good  about or  things to  fantasize about  and then once  I get the  girl  it's like  well then  there's my 
[02:47:00]  reality  I have her  so now  where do I  look forward  to  what do I  fantasize  about  that's  because  you're  putting your  goals  outside of  you  as opposed  to  inside  you're  making  a human  being  who you're  not in  control of  you can  only control  yourself  and that's  what drives  me nuts  is when  people are  like  Sean do  you change  people  no  I don't  change  people  I'm  realistic  I influence  change  but at the  end of the  day they're  going to  either take  hold of  it or  they're  not  and that's  what I  think  separates  me  from a  lot of  the  motivational  thinking  because I  tell somebody  look at  the end of  this day  when you leave  this office  or when you  leave my 
[02:47:30]  airspace  you're  going to  have  choices  to make  and so  with your  relationships  first of all  I don't  know much  of your  background  so I'm  not going  to act  like I  do  in fact  we just  met  so I'd  be more  curious to  ask you  the question  of are  you happy  with the  way you're  running your  relationships  yes and  no  the one  I'm in  now I  like  we get  along  very well  part of  it is  look  you know  you quit  drinking  you quit  drugs  so you  know  sex  has always  been  that's  been  number  one  so I  cheat  so what  happens  is when  you cheat  you screw  the relationships  up  but I don't  really sabotage  it consciously 
[02:48:00]  I just get  caught  it's part of  it's my greed  I'm greedy  sure  well right  there if you  notice his  identity  which you  just outed  right there  is the  mentality  that you're  greedy  I would  disagree  I bet  you're not  greedy  I believe  there's probably  some part  of you  that feels  like maybe  you'll never  have enough  yes  yeah  which is a  scarcity  mindset  that many  of us get  caught in that  trap  and so we  try to  fill it up  and get  distracted  so we  don't have  to really  deal with  that part  of us  because we're  ashamed of  it or we're  angry with  it and so 
[02:48:30]  when I deal  with a human  being I  very much  don't care  about the  external  behavior  because that's  just a  symptom  you know  cheating  or drinking  or anything  that a human  being does  on the outside  it's just a  symptom of  what they're  trying to  cover up  on the  inside  what they're  not  comfortable  with  and when  human  beings  come to  work  with me  I get  them on  the same  page  with  themselves  you can  think about  it for a  moment  we talked  about this  I think  in the  third  chapter  that you  have two  things going  for you  in life  willpower  and imagination  and most 
[02:49:00]  people think  that they  just need  more willpower  and that's  not true  that's why  people go  on yo-yo  diets  that's why  people get  into great  relationships  and sabotage  them  that's why  people make  a bunch  of money  and then lose  it all  because they  think they  just need  more willpower  but willpower  is not  enough  that's just  what your  conscious mind  can handle  whereas you  got to get  to the  imagination  and that's  the other  element we  have  the imagination  is that part  that can  lock onto  your identity  I'm greedy  right  I'll never  have enough  so then when  you finally  get to a  life  where you  have enough  as a human 
[02:49:30]  being that  likes to be  right  you race  back to  the picture  of  but no  no  I'm a  greedy  guy  and I  can't  have  enough  so that's  when you  sabotage  it is  unconscious  it is  outside of  your control  in terms  of what  you're aware  of  however  when you  really study  your mind  you realize  oh my goodness  you know  human beings  when they  come to  work with  me  the reason  why  I am so  confident  is because  I'm on  the same  page  with myself  I talk  to myself  like a  best friend  would  now that's  awkward  most of us  feel really  uncomfortable  treating ourselves  like a friend 
[02:50:00]  because well  insecurity  sells  and it's  cooler to  make friends  with somebody  by beating  yourself up  self-deprecating  humor will get  you friends  fast  because most  people are  self-deprecating  if you start  treating yourself  with love and  respect people  are uncomfortable  around you  and yet  you'll continue  to get a  better quality  of life  and they'll  keep pointing  fingers at you  and saying  all these nasty  things sometimes  and you can't  let that bother  you  I also find  it's a fear  too of  normalcy  like a fear  of  mediocrity  or settling 
[02:50:30]  like becoming  an adult  like once you're  in a relationship  and you're happy  in a relationship  that kind of  constitutes marriage  or the end game  as opposed to  like well I still  have a destination  you feel like  you don't have a  destination  or I feel like  I don't have a  destination  when I'm in a  happy relationship  it's almost like  okay this is it  I'm now an adult  it's real  as opposed to  like someday  I'll do that  someday I'll  kind of like  looking forward  but there's a part  of you that  sounds like  that is  that likes  the excitement  and the drama  and the change  the uncertainty  the adrenaline rush  that comes from 
[02:51:00]  oh I just screwed up  what's going to happen next  but Jimmy  why is that bad  it's bad  when I sabotage  a good thing  like when I throw  out a good thing  but I mean  if it led to marriage  and then like  can't that be cool  can't that like  you continue to grow  as a person  sure the addicted part  it's the addicted part  the sex addicted part  I mean I'm aware  of what it is  I mean it's just  it's really you  wanting to feel good again  that's what addiction is  I gotta get back  to that neutral space  where I feel good  in the moment  now it's fleeting 
[02:51:30]  when you go outside  of you  with women  with food  with drugs  with alcohol  it's fleeting  but when you do it  with contribution  and personally growing  that can't be taken  from you  that can't be replaced  I am a very comfortable  human being  because I'm constantly  giving to this planet  and I've been called  all kinds of names  I've been made fun of  for my appearance  for my attitude  for my way of living  and yet at the end of the day  I know that all those comments  aren't about me  it's about them  and I won't say that militarily 
[02:52:00]  I just know  that when a human being  is secure with me  they feel comfortable  around me  when a human being is not  that's what many feel  the need to attack  and you have no problem  getting women right  so I would say  I have an easy time  you have an easy time  that's like an amazing statement  for the average Joe  sure, sure  I mean you've studied women  for what?  about 30 years  from birth  no  I would say  I've been  professionally  you've been studying women  for 5 or 6 years  yeah exactly  and I find that women  are not attracted  to a tall dark 
[02:52:30]  and handsome man  that's a misnomer  they're attracted  to the feelings  that they get  when they're around  a tall dark  and handsome man  if you can evoke  those feelings  in a 3 foot tall  body that's 45 pounds  and in a wheelchair  they all of a sudden  start falling in love  with you  and I know  because it's happened  and I've had  relationships with women  that most men  would just love  to even get to go  on a date with  and I say this  as humbly as I can  it's that  a woman is attracted  to a man  who owns his reality  who is very confident 
[02:53:00]  in the space  that he enters  and who's very playful  and can make her laugh  so if you bring confidence  and a sense of humor  to the table  you've got a woman's attention  no matter how hot  or how high  of the status chain she is  I have half of that  like I'm funny  and I'll make them laugh  but then the confidence goes  and I'm fledgling  with a half an erection  and making excuses  and they're playing  with my nipples  and it's not working  again and again and again  I really did not  need that visual  my yogurt's coming up  from breakfast now  thank you  no it's true 
[02:53:30]  when you're just  the funny guy  then you're the clown  and if you're just  the confident guy  then you're the serious dude  who can't ever just relax  and it takes  you know  when women ask me  they're like  okay so what does it take  to attract a man  right  because you guys  probably have like  four or five women listeners  on the planet  and I would say to them  you know your moms  right  I would tell them  that a man is attracted  to a woman  who is adventurous  and compassionate  think about it guys  when a woman is adventurous  that gives you the idea  that she's going to be  playful in bed  she's going to make  a great partner  traveling the world 
[02:54:00]  with you  doing big things  and compassionate  tells you  even if you don't  want to have kids  that she could be  a good mother  if she's compassionate  you know that  on a bad day  when you're exhausted  and you're drained  she'll be there for you  and so men want a woman  who is adventurous  and compassionate  women want a man  who's confident  and funny  and you bring those  things together  and you have  sexual attraction  damn  that does make sense  it does  are you married  nope  in a relationship  no  well there's a girl  that I'm pursuing  and she 
[02:54:30]  I just told her  recently  I said  you just really  need to wake up  to the fact  that you're in love  with me  and she's like  I might have  some feelings  so I like a good chase  and we've known  each other for  a couple years  who knows  if that will ever  pan out  I mean I'm extremely  busy with  the book that just  came out  the television show  that will come out  soon  traveling speaking  doing the therapy  so I'm in this  state of mind  where I realize  that I don't need  women to be happy  anymore  which is what I  thought I needed  to have that  beautiful woman  on my arm  when I would come  to a party 
[02:55:00]  I'd feel good  about myself  and then I realized  that that's fleeting  that's going outside  of myself  to feel good  and now once I'm  so passionate  about getting  this message out  through the books  and the television show  I'm very fulfilled  so when the right girl  comes along  it'll just happen naturally  so this girl  that you like  how do you know  is it a professional way  or does somebody  just know from  living around her  she's a friend  of a friend  okay  we got Blind Dave  on the line  he wants to say  hi to Sean  Blind Dave  how you doing  hi buddy  as far as the 
[02:55:30]  quick fix therapy  I feel this guy  is using his handicap  to mask his dishonesty  and with the quick fix  I revert to the  Simpsons episode  of Be Like the Boy  and when people  ask me about my situation  and I say  it could always be worse  this is a perfect example  thank you  why do you think  he's masking dishonesty  I think he just wanted  to make his statement  I don't think he stayed on  no he hung up actually  he's lost Blind Dave  yeah Blind Dave  yeah but I don't know  why he thinks  that you're masking dishonesty  I think Sean's actually 
[02:56:00]  a pretty fucking  straight shooter  I don't think he's dishonest  Blind Dave's a little  negative Nelly  yeah I also remember guys  my biggest  people that are against me  often times  are the disabled  because  I don't believe  that I am  and that makes them uncomfortable  you think he was jealous  just because he was talking  into the earpiece  and listening in the mouth  I don't know  if he was jealous  in fact  I hope that he has  peace in his life  and I hope he finds it  you know  and if bashing me  helps him feel  a little bit better today  then God bless him 
[02:56:30]  it's not going to  stop my  I'm sure he'd send you  an email  but well we know  he's a little rough  to a type  Sean going with that though  what do you wish  you could do  that he can't  you know  when I was younger  I had a lot more  I wish I could do this  I wish I could do that  now I realize  that I have everything  either that I want  right now in my life  where I'm headed  in that direction  you know what I mean  most people can't  play professional ball  right  most people can't  be in the Olympics  there's a lot of things  that most people can't do  that they would maybe  like to do 
[02:57:00]  there are days where  you know  like my arms  won't reach the top  of my head  so when I have  something as simple  as an itch  on the top of my head  I'm not going to be  able to reach it  and that might sound  funny to most  but it's true  it's a big reminder  when you're all alone  and you have nothing  to scratch your head with  that you have a condition  you know  so there's little things  just bash your wheelchair  into a wall  with your head down  that would annoy  the crap out of me  no I have a little  back scratcher  that I whip out  usually and scratch 
[02:57:30]  the head with  real casually  like it's no big deal  so it's the mundane  things you wouldn't  guess  it's not the  oh I wish I could  climb up the stairs  I have people that  carry me  that's alright  are you able to drive  not yet  eventually  that will be a part  of the show  it will show me  figuring out  how to get a vehicle  accessible  and trying to lean  on Porsche  to make a Cayenne  accessible  that's hilarious  that's great  it goes right  to the fucking  throat  why do I want  like a soccer mom  vehicle  I don't want to  get that minivan 
[02:58:00]  pull up  with the door  opening slowly  did you ever go  through that  why me phase  even as a kid  I talk about  in the book  that there was  a moment  in fourth grade  it was Halloween  morning  and I was  outside of my  wheelchair  on the floor  and I loved  Halloween  because in one  day of the year  everybody got  dressed up  and I got  to blend in  you know  and so I was  rolling around  I caught my  left leg  on the corner  of the door  I bent it back  and I snapped  into the femur  and I was so angry  because I knew  I was going to  miss the party  I knew I was  going to miss  the fun 
[02:58:30]  the trick-or-treating  the one day  of blending in  and I screamed out  why me  what did I ever  do to deserve this  and my mom  called me down  my parents  couldn't race me  to the hospital  when I would  fracture  there was nothing  the doctors  could do  so they had  to keep me  immobilized  for four to six  weeks  wherever I would  break  and my mom  asked me a profound  question  we talk about  in the book  in detail  and I say  my mom said  to me  Sean is this  going to be  a gift  or a burden  in your life  and in that moment  something like  cosmic happened  I realized that  you know  I really did 
[02:59:00]  and do  love my life  amidst the pain  maybe the purpose  to why I had  to go through  all this  is to teach others  how to do the same  because let's face it  we all fracture  maybe not with our bones  but in our life  with our marriage  with our health  with our finances  and so maybe the purpose  to my life  is to help you  heal your fractures  when you fracture a bone  obviously it hurts  but because it's brittle  does it hurt as much  as anyone else's bone  absolutely  in fact when people say  did you ever get used to it  I said  my response is always the same 
[02:59:30]  well let me hit your thumb  with a hammer  ten times  and then on the eleventh time  you let me know  if it eases up  it's a good example  yeah it sure is  now the TV show  is it going to be  a reality show  it sounds like  it'll be a docu-series  a docu-series  okay  let's say hi to Vinny  in Rockland  Vinny  Sean Stevenson  in the studio  yes  what's up Vinny  my girlfriend  walked out on me  after four years  yesterday  or actually a week ago  she packed her shit  and she left  she had something  that was described as 
[03:00:00]  I'm sure I'm butchering  the word  Disney depression  where  Disney sick  or something  I never saw it coming  and she just left  and I've been  absolutely miserable  and I just feel like  I can't be alone  and I don't know  what that is  I don't know  what kind of fear  that is  like we talked  earlier today  and she's like  well I'm going out  tonight  I'm going to the city  and I said  yeah well I'm going  to go out too  but you know  I know the whole night  I'll just be worrying  about her  and what she's going  to be getting into  put in a pool  a bar  and a movie theater  in your house  yes 
[03:00:30]  well I already have  the guns  so I guess  I'm halfway to Anthony  alright so  here's the thing  would you like  some ideas  or you just  wanted to share  I need help  because sometimes  I feel like  I can't get  through the next  five minutes  absolutely  right away  I would tell you  to do two things  first thing is  go hit the gym  if you are starting  to exercise  you're going to  release all the  natural chemicals  into your brain  that are going to  pep you up a little bit  and you can do that  naturally and safely  so I would tell you  to hit the gym  that's the first thing  the second thing  I also haven't been eating 
[03:01:00]  I haven't had anything  to eat in like 37 hours  and I've been smoking  like a chimney  well let me ask you this  is that behavior  going to bring you  closer to her  or push you away from her  I understand the logic  behind it  but I just don't know  how to pacify myself  yeah yeah  well stop pacifying yourself  and listen closely  so here's what you need  to do  you need to hit the gym  and the second thing  you need to do  is do you have anybody  in your life  that you really look up to  that's you know  really positive  and a strong force  in your life  I've got an army  of good friends around me  sure sure  you need to spend time 
[03:01:30]  you need to get out  of that house  when you are alone  what happens is  you keep looping  that story  and you probably  and tell me if I'm right  you probably go  between two emotions  right now  which is anger  and sadness  is that correct  it's either I'm angry  and I want to call her  and tell her to go to hell  or I'm a crying  bubbling mess  sure  and so you're in a crazy  eight right now  you get so angry  that then you get exhausted  so you start getting sad  and then you get so sad  that you get angry  that you're sad  and you get angry again  is that accurate  yeah  because I feel like  I do the right thing  when I get angry 
[03:02:00]  and everybody tells me  to act from strength  act from strength  be strong  and then I get strong  and then I think  well maybe I was too strong  sure  so I'm going to give you  some advice  it may not sound too manly  but just trust me on it  anyway  you need to start journaling  you need to go  get yourself a journal  get out a pen  and write down  everything that's upsetting  you right now  get it out on paper  because if you keep  looping it in your head  it's going to own you  get it out on paper  that's going to help  a little bit  the second thing  is you've got to  hit that gym  the third thing  is you've got to  get around those  positive people  get out of the house  and the fourth thing  that will really help you out  is you need perspective 
[03:02:30]  right now  you need to go to  a hospital  and maybe  donate your time  to a burn victim unit  you need to  go to a soup kitchen  you need to put your life  in perspective  and realize that  yes  this hurts  I'm not telling you  it doesn't  I'm not in your shoes  I have no clue  what you're physically  going through right now  I have an idea  but I'm not you  so you need to get  some perspective  in your life  by seeing that  right now  you are an asset  to this planet  that you could be  doing things  to make this world  a better place  and in that process  you'll magically  begin to start to heal 
[03:03:00]  and truth be told  you may or may not  get back together  with this girl  you may not  and I want you  to start to see  that you  are becoming the man  that's going to attract  the kind of woman  that's not going  to walk out on you  and you're also  going to attract  the kind of behavior  that's going to make  a woman not want  to walk out on you  thank you  I'll buy your book  why did she leave  did she say  did you just screw up  get caught cheating  you didn't hit her  what happened  no I didn't hit her  what happened was  we've had a trust issue  because there was  some sort of infidelity  a year ago 
[03:03:30]  and there was never  any proof behind it  she always denied it  so what I would  find myself doing  and I dated her  three years before this  I never had any trust issues  I found myself  going through her phone  ok  and you know  and harmless stuff  like texts from her boss  and stuff like that  had me thinking  well what the hell  is she doing  right  and I was never able  to regain that trust  and it caused  you know  and I drank a lot too  so I came home one day  I drank a lot  and I threw things  around the house  but then she came back  a week later  but the whole week  that she came back  and forgave me for it  it seemed like 
[03:04:00]  she was completely  disconnected from me  sure  sure  well in the future  so that you don't  have this happen again  with other women  I would recommend  that you realize  that you have a lot  to bring to the relationship  and if a girl  doesn't want to be with you  then you need to  kindly let her go  as opposed to  try to hold tight  when people try to  hold tight to things  it always slips  between their fingers  but then she calls me  at night time  and she says  oh I miss you  I miss you  sure because what  she's doing  is she's going  through her own  crazy eight right now  she's mad at you  and then she gets  to the point  where she misses you  so she's going 
[03:04:30]  through her own  issues right now  too  amazing  and you're probably  an alcoholic  and her father  is probably  an alcoholic  so she can't  let you go  I'm just kidding  alright Vinny  great call man  take a couple of  Xanax and have  some beers  good luck man  get off your butt  Sean Stevenson's  new book  just giving the  horrible advice  you give the good  advice  I'll give him  the awful advice  he was probably  right she probably  cheated you don't  start thinking that  like you know  she probably  cheated  she was gargling  bleach  he smelled  the only reason  why women cheat  or men cheat  is because they're  not getting 
[03:05:00]  what they need  at home usually  and I find  that when  nice ass  sometimes it's that  simple  usually it's appreciation  but we'll go with  your idea for now  you like the nice  ass right doc  come on  all I gotta say  is I appreciate a  woman who hits the  gym as much as I do  you're not a doctor  yet right but you  will be  I'm completing my  PhD right now  you keep mentioning  the gym  you work out  I work out  I'll show you guys  for a second  and I built up  a physique here  where I actually  have a full  six pack  in my 
[03:05:30]  in my  right here  hold on for a second  I'm taking his  jacket off  so check this out  look he's in shape  Jesus  Jesus Christ  he's  he's got  a six pack  he has a  six pack abs  what the hell is going on  Jesus  it was taking you  so long  I know  what are you doing  the abs  I got all nervous  he's flexing  you don't want him  cracking a rib  Jesus  wow six pack abs  and I  and I share that with you  to make the point  that if  somebody in my condition 
[03:06:00]  can stay in great shape  come on guys  what do you do for the abs  lots of sit-ups  lots of sit-ups  about a hundred a day  I was hoping there was  something simpler  yeah  you know it's funny  I eat a certain food  and then if I shit  at a certain time  my abs are here  sit-ups have got to be  easier with you  just for leverage  leverage  actually they're harder  because I don't have  a leg to hold me down  oh see  so it's kind of relative  I guess  it is  let's go to Joe  in Manhattan  the phones  everybody wants in now  Joe  we're talking to  Sean Stevenson  what's up Joe 
[03:06:30]  how are you buddy  big question in my own life  go back and forth  with this one  do you believe in God  and if you do  what kind of God  do you believe in  I'm going to punch out  shit  do I believe in God  I do believe that there's  something that created me  I do believe that there's  something that made all  this work together  and you know I'd rather  be in that mindset  and be wrong  than live the other way  around  and so I'm not  by any means  a religious pusher  I believe that  whatever works for you  personally  as long as it's not 
[03:07:00]  stepping on other human  beings  it's a great experience  for me personally  I do pray  I do meditate  and I believe that  that there's something  that we can all connect to  that makes us feel at peace  I don't know  if that's an energy source  I don't know  if that's a man  with a long beard  I don't know  I just know for me  that I am at peace  knowing that there is  a higher power  very good  let's say hi to Fred  in Miami  Fred  hey guys  hi Fred  what's up Fred  hey Jim  how you doing  good bye  hey  I just had a question  let me paint the picture 
[03:07:30]  for you  I found out that my  fiance after about  five years  was banging  some other dude  and I booted her out  about four weeks later  I connected  I wasn't going through  all this shit  I connected with  a girl that I used to  date in high school  and started casually  seeing her  she was  pushing and pushing  and pushing  for a relationship  with me  and truth be told  kind of pushed her way  into my life  to the point where  now I've been seeing her  for about five months  we're living together  and she's incredibly 
[03:08:00]  incredibly insecure  and jealous  over me  to the fact where  she's checking my phone  she's hacking into  my email account  if I get on the computer  that I'm talking  with other girls  and I'm going to  just try to trade up  to the next best thing  and she's making my life  like crazy  but I care about her  because I dated her  in high school  and we've always  kept in touch  throughout both of our  other relationships  but there's just  it seems like  there's no trust  she's starting to go  to therapy now  and I'm just like 
[03:08:30]  I'm having a rough time  convincing myself  to stick with it  do you think  that she can grow  to the point  and get over  these trust issues  I believe human beings  are capable  of a lot of things  I don't know about her  I don't know her background  I don't know  what she's going through  but I can tell you this  you can be supportive  and you can be understanding  but also you have to  have a threshold  of which you will tolerate  and she's got to know  what that is  you said 
[03:09:00]  just right  on this phone  that she pushed  her way  into your life  correct?  yeah correct  so basically  anything that happens  now  just be open  to the fact  that you brought  it into your world  and so now  it's time  to deal with it  and I say that  as lovingly as I can  but the truth is  when somebody's  usually pushy  they're usually  also needy  and they kind of  go hand in hand  so you have to  either give her space  and know that  it's going to be  possibly a rough ride  and hold on  and keep yourself 
[03:09:30]  entertained with  good things  and keep being supportive  or you have to  set a threshold  and set a standard  of how you want  to be treated  and if she can't  live up to that  you need to  let her know  that you need  to move on  and human beings  hate to do that  we feel guilty  for leaving somebody  who's codependent  however they pull us  down to the bottom  of the pool  and I don't believe  that's what you need  to be doing either  yeah  so it's really  it's really  you know  you're going to have  to have some  serious conversations  with your woman  and tell her  that you love her  if you do 
[03:10:00]  and let her know  that you care about her  but also let her know  what's acceptable  and what's not  and then also  be an example  in the relationship  and you need to come  from the point  where you're not  afraid either  cool man  thanks  I'll get the book  I appreciate it  alright brother  take care  it's funny  I've dealt with  the same stuff  in the past  and yet every time  I was always cheating  so it was like  it was basically  just a game of  cat and mouse  well when people  hurt us  we want to hurt them  back often times  yeah  yeah  I'll get even  with you  whether it's  our parents  or our lover  or our boss 
[03:10:30]  and it only  continues the  negative cycle  Chuck  is this Chuck  in Tennessee  yeah  good evening  hi Chuck  hey Chuck  I wanted to ask  about weight loss  and keeping weight off  I always had a problem  with going up  and down  in weight  a lot  and I was  wondering what  he thought about  as far as therapy  goes  and helping your  weight loss  and keeping your  weight off  if you've had a  problem going up  and down  your whole life  and I don't mean  15-20 pounds  I mean I can go up 
[03:11:00]  100  and lose 100  and really work  hard at it  and then just  all of a sudden  I'm eating again  and it's just  really hard  so why do you  like to eat  what does it do  for you  that's why  I don't know  that's why  I thought therapy  might help me  I mean  I didn't have  a bad child  or nothing  my parents  were divorced  but I didn't  get beat on  or nothing  sure  well  up and down  weight loss  is usually  because deep  down inside  you're conflicted  you want that 
[03:11:30]  gratification  but you also  feel guilty  so there's this  horrible  cat and mouse  game you play  in your head  and also  you think it's  more willpower  I just need  to be better  at staying  away from the  food  but food  is not  the problem  the issue  is deep  inside your  mind  you probably  have a picture  of who you  think you  are  and that  may be  somebody  who's  overweight  and so  when you  start losing  the weight  you don't  feel like  yourself  and so  then you  start eating  again  and human  beings  love to be  right  even if  it's  something  negative  that they're  right about  and that's 
[03:12:00]  why we  continue  negative  cycles  we have to  get you  on the same  page  do I think  that therapy  could help  yeah I do  connect with  and that  really  understands  the big  picture  and it's  not gonna  just go  after it  from a  diet  standpoint  because if  you just  take it  from the  external world  you're gonna  lose the  weight  you're gonna  walk out  you're gonna  be like  thanks  and then  something's  gonna happen  in your life  you're gonna  go you know  what I don't  feel like  myself  and you're  gonna go  back to  getting that  weight  so you gotta  get that  identity  that you  are a person  that's in  shape  and that's  healthy  and you gotta  use other 
[03:12:30]  means like  exercise  and meditation  or prayer  it's just  an outlet  you're using  and you may  have a body  that gains  weight faster  than some  and that's  the  as you said  earlier  the cross  that you  have to bear  and I would  recommend  that you  find the right  person that  really gets  the big picture  as a therapist  and get a copy  of the book  see if it can  help you  let me know  drop me an email  there's an email  in the back  of the book  and what's  the name  of the book  the book is 
[03:13:00]  called  get off your  butt  B-U-T  so I would  be in shape  but I would  be better  in my marriage  but  and I just  find that  once a human  being gets  off their butt  their life  gets amazing  there's a forward  in here too  by Anthony Robbins  who's  thank you  thank you buddy  he's  you know  look  the guy  we've goofed  on Anthony Robbins  but you know  what  he does  speaking engagements  in front of  like 8,000 people  I mean  everywhere he goes  he sells out  everywhere  that bastard  goes  there's a mobbed  arena to see him 
[03:13:30]  he's doing something  right  and your friends  are Neil Strauss  right  we had him  in recently  he's a pretty  cool author  absolutely  author  yeah I was  trying to get  when I was in LA  my manager knows  Neil well  and I was trying  to bang this girl  who worked for  she was a penthouse  like softcore girl  and I was like  I read the game  and I was like  I want to neg her  and I was just  I was so close  to getting her  but I just gave way  that I was in love  with her too fast  I wanted to talk  to Neil so bad  because I know  he could have  got me in her pants  that's kind of  a side track  Sean you hit a nerve 
[03:14:00]  with our listeners  the phones  I don't know  I don't even know  where to go  maybe you can  help me out here  has a compulsion  with prostitutes  that's Jim N  in the studio  with you  a guy that doesn't  want to fall into  old traps  my wife is possessive  any of these  you want to  I think the wife  is possessive  for 300  all right  Ray in Nevada  what's up Ray  I've been with  my wife for 
[03:14:30]  about a year  and I managed  to get her  pregnant right off  managed was that  your goal  or  no it was not  okay  and you know  26 years old  she's 26 years old  and she had  the top of her  head kicked off  by a horse  when she was  about three  but that's  not the point  I'm trying to get to  the point is  she's absolutely  bat shit crazy  about everything  in our relationship  constantly nagging  she's possessive 
[03:15:00]  checks my wallet  all the time  you know  she thinks  there's another woman  you know  do I keep pursuing  the relationship  with her  and raise my  daughter that I  had with her  or do I ditch her  you know  I just  I don't know  what to do  yeah  it's  well keep her  away from horses  that's for sure  second thing  I would tell you  is you really  need to  think about  the relationship  is it something  you enjoy being  when it works  when you're  have you had  moments in the 
[03:15:30]  relationship  where it's working  oh yeah  I mean we go  for like  you know  we're working  on year two  I go for six months  everything's okay  and then it's six months  of fighting every day  I mean to the point  where she's throwing  stuff through the walls  the windows  and I'm just  so what  what do you love  about her  does she hate  does she hate  no no  don't listen to them  they're not going  to help you  what do you love  about her  especially Jimmy  over there  of course  he's a very sick  sick man  and the station's  actually paying me 
[03:16:00]  to work with him  afterwards  really  you need a little  more than 12 hours  just like Jimmy  when I grow up  yeah  try not to do that  what I would recommend  is really sit down  and figure out  what do you love  about her  and you need to  really get this woman  to be comfortable  with the fact  that you're  not going to go  anywhere  if you're really  not going to go  anywhere  the challenge  is women test us  as men  they want to see  if we will walk out  they want to see us  if they can get us 
[03:16:30]  to cave  and the more  we can look at them  and say sweetie  you can say  or do whatever you want  but I'm going to love you  and you don't have a choice  and when you come  from that level  of security  you can't get  as dramatic  as she gets  you can't get  as upset  and you can't  run off yourself  and throw a little tantrum  you need to  just keep a calm  persona  as she rages  because eventually  she'll realize  that she's not going  to make you cave  now I don't know  the complexities  of this 
[03:17:00]  and I don't know  the seriousness  of the situation  but I would tell you  that would be  my first step  alright  alright  well thanks  I appreciate your time  and ONA  I've been listening  to you guys  since you guys  came on the air  first time caller  great time  thank you  this one might be brutal  but let's go  with this one  we have Sean Stevenson  in studio  Jared in New York  Jared  Jared  are you the Jared  that calls us  all the time  hello 
[03:17:30]  Jared  you're on the air  sir  Jared  yes  it's Jared  oh  okay I'm sorry  we got Sean Stevenson  in studio  what do you got for him  well  my son got killed  in a car accident  last July  on his birthday  and  I can't  I can't get over it  I don't want to get over it  I just can't get around it  sure  sure  well listen 
[03:18:00]  I  I'm not in your shoes  and I'm not going to pretend to be  my  my  question to you is  what do you want  in your life  at this point  I don't know  yeah you  you need to decide  what that is  and  you need to live out  your  it was your son  yeah  you need to live out  your son's legacy  because  you don't want to  waste the rest of your life  because that's 
[03:18:30]  I guarantee you  not what he would want for you  and  loss is a very difficult thing  and  I'm not going to sugar coat it  and I'm going to tell you  that  it will hurt  there will never come a day  where you'll think about  your  the loss of your son  and be happy about that  that's  that's not what we're talking about  what I want to do  is I want to help you  live a productive life  where  you can find happiness  in other areas  and  also live out the  positive memories  of your son  in fact a lot of people  have a hard time  getting over the loss of a child 
[03:19:00]  because  you know  we're not supposed to bury our children  it's not  the birth order  it's not  what we want for our lives  and  and I understand that  that's why sometimes  life  isn't fair  and  I would tell you  that the best thing  that you could do  is know that  you don't have to keep  holding on to the sadness  and the anger  in order to keep  loving your son  you could love your son  by living out your life  completely and fully  by doing great things  you know  you could start a  foundation in his name  or  a project  or just go out  and pursue your dreams  that you've been 
[03:19:30]  playing small on  in your life  because that  will be a much  greater legacy  to live out  than to just keep  holding on to the  sadness  or the anger  does that make sense  kind of  and I've been  trying to chew that  off  sure  sure  well  how often  do you  journal about it  have you ever written it out  and gotten out of your head  not  not really  not really  I would recommend  I would recommend that  you know  I  sadly  the sheer numbers of people  that I've met in my life 
[03:20:00]  I've met many fathers  who have lost their sons  in tragic ways  and  as men  we don't really do  well with  intense emotions  as women do  and therefore  I would tell you to journal  it's not the end all  I'm not saying the journal  will bring your son back  but it will bring back  the parts of your son  that you  love  and that you can get  close to again  because  I promise you  someday  somehow  your energy  will align  with your son again  and this is  just a blink of an eye 
[03:20:30]  in all of the universe  and it will all  be back together again  everything in my opinion  and I could be wrong  but everything in my opinion  is  everything will return  into a state of bliss  and in the meantime  you need to  focus on what you loved  about your son  focus on  all the great times  you had with your son  and  make sure that you're  doing something  with your life right now  if you keep looping  that thought of  how unfair it is  that you lost your son  you will be miserable sir  and I  I wish I had  another statement  but it's the truth 
[03:21:00]  you need to  put your life  on a purpose  when you find  your purpose  to your pain  your pain  will decrease  I promise  all right  thank you  you're welcome sir  Jesus  so that  that's a little  intense  with the opening  Anthony show  so I guess  yeah you know  it's real  whatever you know  I got a teary eyeball  what's that  I got a teary eyeball  there you go  holy shit  it's reality  what are you  you know  life sucks sometimes  you just got a real  moment out of me  mother fucker  I say to people 
[03:21:30]  that fairness  is an illusion  when somebody says  to me  well isn't it  not fair  that you got  that body  and I got  this one  and I say  absolutely not  you know  you're dealt  cards in life  and it's not  the cards  that you're dealt  it's how you  play the hand  you guys know  you guys play  Texas Hold'em ever  oh yeah  you can actually  win with a pair  of twos  if everybody else  folds right  you could win  you could go  all in on a pair  of twos  and win  and somebody else  would be like  oh I can't believe  I got a pair  of twos  and they'd be  so angry  it's not the  cards you're dealt  it's how you  play them  and in my life  I don't believe  that I got  dealt a bad 
[03:22:00]  hand with this  body  I got dealt  a different  hand  see I can do  things with  this condition  that you can't  do with yours  I can roll  into a room  I don't have  to spike my  hair  get tattoos  look like I  fell into a  tackle box  to be remembered  I just show up  and that is  a positive aspect  and if I focus  on that  then I can actually  do something  with it  if I keep  focusing on what  I can't do  then I'm miserable  and that's just  not going to be  any good to myself  or the planet  Jesus  you know  you could buy  a house  with a crawl space  and finish the basement 
[03:22:30]  you know  everything is first  class to me  there's a bunch  of things  that  coach doesn't  bother me  coach  economy car sizes  don't bother me  and I'm never  cramped  ever  I've got plenty  of leg room  I can still sit  in my mom's lap  I can sit  in anyone's lap  and you know  I have advantages  did you have  average sized parents  or you're still alive  right  my dad  that's your dad  yeah absolutely  get the fuck  out of here  I don't say that  to me because 
[03:23:00]  I want you guys  to treat me real  as opposed to  being  I thought you were  like his handler  publicist  that's your dad  right there  yep  he's my lackey  I love it  I've seen him  smiling the whole time  like just  proud man  when did you know  you had a special  son  and I mean  special  you know  gifted  freaking  genius  basically  when did you know  go for it  pass  well  actually right  from the beginning  because  what we focused  on from the day  he was born 
[03:23:30]  which we  immediately started  to say  okay  we're faced  with a different  situation here  and we can either  look at  how different  our life  is going to be  or we can look  at how special  our life's going  to be  and we can start  to look at  all the things  he can do  instead of  focusing on  all the things  he can't do  yeah tell him  about the  basketball game  and you know  he used to love  to play basketball  and he  because he's got  a small hoop  in his room  and he throws  a smaller ball  in the hoop  and he would  get a little  down that he  couldn't play  basketball  and I said  Sean 
[03:24:00]  let's look at it  in a different  way  you're a very  smart guy  so what maybe  you can do  is you can  grow up  become very  wealthy  and you can  buy your own  NBA team  instead of  worrying about  not being able  to play basketball  let's take  everything from  the aspect  of how  you can  do it  instead of  what you  can't do  wow  and I  have a great  mom  and they  have a great  marriage  and you know  some people  use that as  their butt  against me  they'll say  but you got  great parents  and I say  look I got  the great  parents  you got  the working  legs  let's keep 
[03:24:30]  going  so much  bubble wrap  did you buy  a lot of  egg crate  foam  cheap skin  and egg crate  foam  that's what  he had to  be laid on  I got used  to the  bare skin  rug  how many  times in the  ER  growing up  actually we  didn't race  me to the  hospital  we was  Shriners  hospital  and because  he broke  so often  a lot of  times he'd  be broken  and we'd  have to  depend on  him to  tell us  because it  wouldn't  even show  on an  x-ray  it might 
[03:25:00]  be a  hairline  fracture  that was  extremely  painful  that wouldn't  show up  so people  at Shriners  hospital  in Chicago  knew us  and they  basically  trained us  how to  immobilize  him  and they'd  give us  casting  material  so we  didn't have  to put him  through the  pain of  taking him  to hospital  the whole  first chapter  is about  my family  and raising  me  and where  I've come  through  and what  I've had  to go  through  and it's  been a wild  journey  and I  wouldn't trade  my parents  for anything  on this planet  I'm just  imagining the  co-pays 
[03:25:30]  it's like  an ATM machine  just pumping  out co-pays  what was the  scariest  experience you  had  well there  had to be  one that  was really  really  South Carolina  there were  a number  of scary  ones  one we  were in  South Carolina  on vacation  and  don't say  the name of  the hotel  then  no we  asked for a  handicap room  how old  were you  13  he was 13  we rolled  into the room  and a hawk  and we were  located on a  harbor overlooking  ships and  fishing boats 
[03:26:00]  and things  and I said  what a great  view  and as I  opened the  curtains in  the sliding  door so  that we  could see  out onto  the deck  Sean as  I had my  back turned  wheeled out  on the deck  except the  deck was  about a foot  lower than  the room  and he  went head  over wheels  on top of  himself onto  the deck  and it broke  his nose  broke both  his arms  wow  both legs  and he was  bleeding profusely  because he had  broken his nose  we didn't  know what 
[03:26:30]  was wrong  we didn't  know if  he had  got a  concussion  or what  and we  had to  immediately  get him  back up  and get  emergency  services  but when  emergency  services  came we  tried to  explain to  them what  disorder he  had and  that they  wouldn't be  able to  touch him  unless we  were allowed  to help  and they  said listen  sir either  we do this  or we don't  do anything  I said then  you're not  doing anything  get your head  orthopedic  surgeon on the  phone at the  hospital  and we  finally talked  to the  orthopedic  surgeon at  the hospital  local hospital  we explained 
[03:27:00]  to him I  was on the  board of  directors of  the OI  foundation  and that  this was  his condition  and he  worked with  us  so let me  ask you  you didn't  want them  actually  setting  well you  couldn't  set  because they  were hairlines  a lot of  times  and break  something up  right  absolutely  if you  would have  set the  bones it  would cause  them to  crumble  more  but it  was frightening  because we  were way  far away  from home  we knew  we somehow  had to get  back to  Chicago  from where  we were  and fortunately  had friends  in that area  that allows 
[03:27:30]  to stay  there for  six weeks  until he  healed  six weeks  back on  an airplane  so what  did you  so you're  sitting there  just with  two broken  legs  two broken  arms  a broken  nose  and what  is it you  can do  what you  put casting  material on  at all  nothing  is out  of alignment  you just  have to  immobilize  him  wow  so I  had a lot  of time  and people  ask me  they're like  with ace  bandages  popsicle sticks  yeah  to immobilize  it  I've had a lot  of time  to think  in my life  because while  other kids  were running  around playing 
[03:28:00]  at school  I was at  home a lot  of times  just healing  and pain  and so I  grew up  fast  I read  I had books  read to me  I spent time  with adults  that would come  over and visit  me  so I really  figured out  what the meaning  of life is  at a young  age  and I  haven't  looked back  flexibility  real quick  absolutely  you couldn't  ever be  attached to  the outcome  of something  if we were  planning a  vacation  and went  to walk  out the  door  and he  broke  his leg  the vacation  was called  off right  then  did that  happen  many many  times  yeah  but I 
[03:28:30]  mean we  all have  to learn  to adapt  in fact  when I  go into  school  systems  and they  say  oh are  you  disabled  and I  the first  thing out  of my  mouth  is  disabled  means  not able  like I  said  earlier  and the  only  disability  is one's  refusal  to adapt  see I  adapt  constantly  and you  know  Darwin  when they  talk about  evolution  it's not  the strong  survive  it's the  one that  evolves  and adapts  the fastest  that survives  so will I  have a gorgeous  wife and  produce great  offspring  you better  believe it  because I'm  adapting  I'm learning  that the  mind 
[03:29:00]  is what  controls  reality  not the  other way  around  amazing  how was  the view  did you  get to  see it  at all  for like  five seconds  as it  rose to  the height  of my  forehead  yeah  it was  amazing  as I  remember  I  hope  it was  good  that  would  suck  if you  were like  dad  this  is  very  overrated  it's like  a brick wall  or something  some cruddy  deal  back to the  phones  Matt in  Jersey  Matt  hey  Jimmy  what's that  I want to 
[03:29:30]  say  you weren't  the only  one  getting  misty  eyed  out  here  as far  as  Ann  me  thinking  I'm  going to  run  right out  and buy  the  book  so  awesome  man  thank you  oh go ahead  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to  step on you  I was just going to say  with that  I'm punching out  guys  okay  I think you're  going to sell  a lot of books  today  thank you  I really do  sure  you know what  I've been thinking  this whole time  this whole time 
[03:30:00]  Fezzy  oh wow  we got a guy  who works for  Ron and Fez  well he's Fez  from Ron and Fez  you could help him  out tremendously  yeah  that's a good point  only if he  wanted it  true  see that's the thing  some people are  professional victims  in fact I've worked  with a lot of  on air talent  and celebrities  and things of that  nature  and I find that  some people make  their shtick  being angry  or being a victim  and they're afraid  if they get happy  they're going to 
[03:30:30]  lose their shtick  and so it's a battle  between am I happy  or am I wealthy  and that's a horrible  battle to do  you just described me  and only recently  decided to change that  sure  I don't think  I've announced it  on the air  but I started therapy  about two months ago  awesome  I finally got sick of it  it's like you know  there's other sides of me  that need to come out  yeah  I'm sick of the same  fucking path  well you can  you can have all  the money in the world  you can have  beautiful women  on your arm  you can have  great cars  great houses  you can have  the external world  that looks like 
[03:31:00]  you live in the good light  and you could be miserable  are we in agreement on that  yes  yes  yes  and yet you could also  be you know  you know  just sitting on a park bench  and be at peace  so it's not about  the external world  it's about the internal world  and that's what I get  go into  is that  you know  when somebody comes to me  and they say  you know  I would be happier  if I got this plastic surgery  like a young lady comes in  I say you know what  maybe  for a few weeks 
[03:31:30]  or months  but at some point  you're going to find  something else  that you don't like  and that's why plastic surgery  can become addictive  I mean we see that  so whenever you think  that by changing the outside world  you'll improve the inside world  you're delusional  that's ridiculous  right  you gotta work on the inside  what I always say  is mentality creates reality  not the other way around  I watch  The Biggest Loser  and these guys  lose a tremendous amount of weight  and then most of them  go back to their regular lives  and I don't think  they work on the inside that much  I think they do a little bit  on the show 
[03:32:00]  but it's mostly about  working on the outside  and losing the weight  and getting in shape  blah blah blah  and time and time again  but they don't really  want to talk about this  these guys are going  right back to the  the way they were  before The Biggest Loser  because they never worked on  the reason why  they were overeating  here's a study  that they talk about  they took people  who became quadriplegics  because of car accidents  and they took a group  of people who were  lottery winners  and they found  a correlation  and the correlation is  while they sound like  the opposite ends  of the spectrum  quadriplegic  never feeling 
[03:32:30]  from the neck down  winning the lottery  no longer  having to worry about money  and yet the correlation is  over time  both groups  went back  to their normal behavior  the people who were  miserable before money  were miserable with money  the people who were  happy and feeling blessed  before the accident  were happy and blessed  after the accident  but they both had  a little period of time  where their behavior  changed temporarily  and then it went back  so it's obvious  that the external world  is not what dictates  the internal world  it's the other way around  although if I had to choose 
[03:33:00]  I'd probably take lottery  give them the choice  you always go with lottery  you want to take one more call  and then we'll get you out of here  let's do it  you got the compulsion  with prostitutes  you got lost my family  in a tornado  Jesus  I guess you got to go  with that one  enough of the lost the family  I know  Ant doesn't like  when we get a little serious  you know  there's a little uncomfortable  I see  it's alright  it'll be fun  he's a very sad fellow  alright let's have one  I'm a sad fellow? 
[03:33:30]  yes  really?  no  because you make me think I am  do you guys need to cuddle right now?  no I don't  I'll do that later  you guys know you spoon  come on  yeah  spooning with Jimmy  he's so soft and hairless  I know  but he always makes me go in the front  because if I go in the back  you know  wow  alright let's go to the tornado  let's say hi to Chris in Missouri  Chris  hey guys  hey Chris  what's up buddy  hey Chris  hello 
[03:34:00]  yes you're on the air sir  Chris  I'm here  here's the problem  yes he's  are you kidding or are you serious?  I don't even know what he's saying  but I know it's not serious  Chris  he's just screwing everything up  are you serious or you're joking?  I don't know  alright  I think we did it  that's awesome  let's end on that note  that awesome note  it's like this awkward feeling  we're like  thanks for being here Sean  no  what are you kidding?  we decided to really take the high road  and really do something different today 
[03:34:30]  so it's a good place to end  before the wheels start falling off  and I'm surprised  the listeners actually  weren't being jackasses more  to tell you the truth  yeah  I knew there'd be one  that got on there  that I'm sure  they're usually what we call  silly geese  hey  nice  one thing we forgot to ask you about  you worked for Clinton  yeah  what kind of guy is he?  you know he's amazing  I talked about it in the book  that he's not just  the greatest communicator  they said that about Reagan  he's the greatest connector  so like when you're around him  and he's talking to you 
[03:35:00]  you feel like he's not thinking  about the rest of his day  he's just talking to you  you know there's this moment  after he got out of office  he was in Chicago  and we met for a little bit  and he came into the room  and he said  Sean  boy am I glad to see you  and you know  maybe he says that to everybody  but the way he said it  was just so genuine  he remembered my name  he had no one there to prompt him  he didn't know I was there  and just  Sean  yeah  you're easy to remember  this is true  this is true  but you gotta remember  you know a president  you know two terms of office 
[03:35:30]  meets lots of people  with all different kinds of conditions  so yes I agree  it's kind of hard to forget me  it gets burned into the back of your mind forever  but yeah  he's just a very  a very caring human being  and whether you like him  or you loathe him  he's good at getting you to laugh  he's good at getting you to  open up about your own hobbies  and he's just  you know I mean  yes there's a plethora of jokes  that come at you know  at me  when I tell people  that I used to work for him  and I've handled them all  but the truth is 
[03:36:00]  I really enjoyed my time with him  and working with him  was a delay  there's a  there's a story about him  De Niro  was supposed to do a sketch together  for some show  and De Niro  he's such a great actor  but comedic sketches  he's just  very awful  and he was panicking  he didn't know what to do  and they said when Clinton came in  he was like  no Bob  we'll just do it like this  and he just told De Niro  how to act the scene out  and they made it funny  like De Niro was just  he's very secure  in his own reality  you know  I learned about compartmentalizing  when I worked for him  because  you know  he had a lot going on 
[03:36:30]  I mean he had these  allegations against him  he had  the year that I was there  the capital guards were shot  remember at the capital  in 1998  we had the bombing  in Afghanistan  at the African  yeah the African embassy  we had the fires in Florida  all these things were taking place  he's having to sign bills  and yet  every meeting he went into  it was like  he just had one thing to do that day  and that's massive compartmentalizing  and I have mad respect for that  yeah  I guess when you're on that level  of responsibility 
[03:37:00]  you learn how to  sure  how to just do one thing at a time  gonna do it all today  yeah  Portionally he was coming unraveled  every five minutes  like he was still thinking about  from like 75  that he could have done better  in Texas  stupid George  well let's thank  Sean Stevenson  for stopping by  this was an amazing hour  it really was  maybe he calls into  the Ron and Fez show today  are you real busy today?  I'd check with my publicist  and show that  I understand  or maybe down the road  yeah I'd love to come on  I come back to New York  quite often  you should be in the studio 
[03:37:30]  for them  I'm telling you  Ron and Fez  that'd be a very interesting  interview too  yeah cause Fez  he definitely is struggling  with a lot of stuff  and it frustrates  the hell out of Ronnie  and Ronnie does what he can  well when we don't feel good  we don't perform well  whether that's in business  or in life  with our health  and so my number one goal  when I'm working with somebody  is let's get you to the point  where you feel good again  and then you'll do well  in your career  okay  the book  Get Off Your Butt  B-U-T  how to end self-sabotage  and stand up for yourself  I'm not just saying this  I'm going to read this one  excellent  you know  a lot of authors come in 
[03:38:00]  and it's like whatever  it's a very big print  you'll be fine  yeah I see that  I see that  I think I can get through  this pretty quickly  which I like too  well thanks for having me on guys  and you can get this anywhere  you can get it on  bookstores  online amazon  borders.com  largeandnoble.com  anywhere  yeah you can get this  it's a very easy book  and his website  timetostand.com  t-i-m-e-t-o-s-t-a-n-d.com  yeah  this is great man  and we don't have to tell  his father  but you got an amazing son there  I'm sure you've heard that 
[03:38:30]  too many times  but not sick of hearing it right  and you also look very young  to be the father  we just thought you were  the publicist  yeah no kidding  yeah he likes to say that  whenever we're at the grocery store  and let's say somebody's  talking to him  I'm like  hey dad  what about that prune juice you needed  and you know  always letting him know  that you are not my brother  all right  just changing gears  as we thank Sean  we got to give props  to whatwouldtylerderdendo.com  www.tdd.com  go there 
[03:39:00]  instead of Perez Hilton  for your celebrity gossip  he's the real deal  he doesn't talk about himself  but he put us right on the front page  oh  it's the headline  that studio must smell terrific  and it's the picture of the Iron Sheik  pardon me Sean  but we had a guy in here yesterday  that peed his pants  and we took a picture  sometimes that happens  and we kind of mocked it  and now it's on a massive website  which we're now promoting  I love how you guys build self-esteem  thank you  you keep me in business  I appreciate it  well you know the Iron Sheik  the wrestler  all you have to say  you're not a wrestling guy 
[03:39:30]  you know I'm  not big into male soap opera stuff  what does the website say  it says  oh well that would help  it says  I hope no one thinks  the Opie and Anthony show  little Jimmy Norton  just went away  when their home station  in New York changed formats  and then watched the ratings drop  to 1-4  well done WXRK  but still the move  to uninterrupted music  should pay off  because uninterrupted music  is very hard to come by  unless you have an iPod  or a dial on your radio 
[03:40:00]  oh they're beating the shit out of me  good  our old boss is nice  but ONA are still on XM and Sirius  and yesterday  they had on  the easily relaxed Iron Sheik  who pissed his pants  without knowing it  during the show  thankfully on a non-fabric couch  it was funny as a listener  but maybe not as an opponent  I don't think it's too much  to ask that the guy  you're wrestling  not  I don't think it's too much  to ask that the guy  you're wrestling  not be on you  the one Sean's dad  is sitting on actually  right there  I also just  I emailed over  the picture I took  of the Sheik's balls 
[03:40:30]  so hopefully that'll be up  later on WWTDD.com  very nice  alright  take a break  we're done  ok  we're done  and we got a little  something that the boys  put together  as far as the Iron Sheik goes  a little movie trailer  thanks to Sean Stevenson  and don't forget  watch me on Letterman  tonight with Kiefer Sutherland  it's on 1130  or just T-Vote  if you're going  I have to get laid  do what you want  see he's on Letterman  tonight there Sean  huh  we gotta help me  get me on there too  you got some pull  not really  no I did in 2006  and then again  this week  actually maybe it's a good thing 
[03:41:00]  if you don't mention my name  probably  yeah I'm sure I'm not gonna help  believe me  unless we'll be on in 5 years  I have a feeling  that you're gonna have  massive success  in the next few years  as far as like  people getting to know  who you are  thank you  no doubt  your time is here my friend  see you guys Monday  yeah the boys put this together  we'll see you Monday  have a great week  bye  somewhere in the Middle East  a murderous crime ring  is about to trigger  an international crisis
