<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with self-deprecating humor about the show's controversial history and listener feedback, ranging from supportive to intensely hateful.  They then launched into a critique of Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton's music, comparing it unfavorably to Chris Isaak's "Wicked Game," interspersed with snippets of the aforementioned celebrity songs. A significant portion was dedicated to a newly created Charlie Sheen rap song, deemed "awful" and a "dud," and the creation of a breathy pop song for Jim Norton by Troy Kwan, the show's music producer.  A recurring bit involving a homemade fart-smelling mask was a central feature, with graphic descriptions of the hosts' and others' experiences wearing it.  The ongoing conflict between listener Bobo and the show's producers was discussed, along with Al Roker's reaction to previous segments about him and the "R-word" pledge, sparking a debate about the sincerity of such pledges.  Jim Norton's appearance on Sean Hannity's show and Hannity's past support for Opie and Anthony were also briefly mentioned.  Troy Kwan was the only guest besides the hosts.

The show continued with a discussion of *Jackass 3D*, focusing on a Steve-O scene involving a fart mask allegedly defecated in by a "fat dude,"  and other stunts including a flying dildo and a vomiting cameraman.  Jim Norton joined the studio. The conversation shifted to Charlie Sheen's recent Twitter explosion and loss of custody, prompting a comparison to Michael Jackson and a discussion about the disparity in consequences for celebrity actions. Norton contributed humorous anecdotes.  More celebrity commentary followed, this time focusing on Courtney Cox and Demi Moore's appearances, using crude and sexually suggestive language.  The "fart mask" experiment continued, with several individuals, including a studio guest ("Jimmy") and a producer ("Sam"), subjected to inhaling farts through the mask, accompanied by detailed descriptions of the smell and experience.  The technical aspects of the mask and the varying smells produced by different types of flatulence were explored.  The iPad 2's release, various mobile phones, and a news story about a 55-year-old farmer who lived without an anus and underwent reconstructive surgery were also discussed, with Dr. Steve providing medical insight.

The show then tackled a medical procedure involving the creation of a rectum, with graphic speculation about its materials and function, further detailed by Dr. Steve.  A caller's question about the alternative use of an ostomy bag led to graphic anecdotes about a friend's ostomy bag malfunctioning in a car.  Michael Moore's comments on wealth inequality and the banking system were discussed, with Opie and Anthony expressing agreement and disagreement with various aspects of his viewpoints.  A lengthy discussion about mortgages, interest rates, and tax write-offs ensued, including personal anecdotes and a CPA caller's professional perspective. The upcoming Mike Tyson pigeon show on Animal Planet was mentioned, alongside an anecdote about Tyson experiencing a panic attack.  Off-color jokes and banter involving E-Rock and Mickey Rooney were included.  Upcoming show segments ("Car Crash Comedy," "Deadliest Snatch") were promoted, alongside a humorous bit about the Mythbusters and a particularly graphic anecdote about a homeless guest, "Tippi Tom," involving petrified feces.

The show moved on to a discussion about Charlie Sheen's excessive media coverage, transitioning to Mickey Rooney's testimony before Congress regarding elder abuse.  The hosts played a soundbite of Rooney's testimony, interjecting with crude jokes and commentary about the alleged "sexual" abuse. The absurdity of the testimony and its genuineness were debated.  The fart mask was again employed, this time on Troy due to a pungent fart from Jimmy.  Malin Akerman joined as a guest, discussing her roles in *The Comeback* and *Happy Thank You More Please*, including anecdotes about filming *The Comeback* and shaving her eyebrows for a role. She also discussed her portrayal of Linda Lovelace.  Two "Beez-It" promotional models, Emily and Leila, made a brief appearance.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Akerman's career.

The final segment featured more discussion with Malin Akerman (referred to as Maylin in this summary). She recounted experiences with incompetent doctors at a children's hospital and shared anecdotes about Henry Winkler.  The hosts joked about the difficulties of interviewing attractive women, and Akerman posed for awkward/sexy photos for Twitter with the help of producer Jimmy.  She promoted her films *Happy, Thank You, More Please* and *Electrolux*,  before departing.  The show concluded with a song and a snippet of Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The show already started, sorry.  Maybe we should start the show at 6 so they can enjoy the first 10 minutes of the show.  Yeah, you know, that would be a...  That's weird.  Nah.  Because we're actually here doing material for each other. 
[00:01:30]  No, it's 610.  That clock is fast.  Oh.  Well, if we're here talking amongst ourselves, having a good time, perhaps management should  be in on it.  With, you know, some pens and watches and...  Right.  I was listening to the replay yesterday of the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  And, uh...  You sound like a madman.  I know.  I was screaming and yelling.  Which is wonderful.  But I just have to say something.  Sam is a prick.  What?  Well, take it...  When you take yourself out of it and just look in from the outside and listen, much like 
[00:02:00]  a listener, you are a prick.  Yeah, for some reason people were...  I got more angry tweets than I've ever gotten yesterday.  A lot of hate tweets.  A lot of violent.  A lot of violence towards me.  It was E-Rock's birthday.  Hateful violence.  Yeah.  Violent, uh...  Hateful violence.  Yeah.  I think they wanted E-Rock to have a nice birthday.  You only turned 40 once.  Yeah.  The 40 thing was hilarious.  I forgot how many times it came up until I was listening to the... 
[00:02:30]  There's a tweet that came in...  Not a tweet.  Instant feedback in the middle of the night.  It just says, please fire Sam today.  Do people love me?  And then the next guy says, you guys suck a dick.  So...  All right.  Why are we feedback?  Hey.  Oh, literal listener.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Whatever you're doing.  There you go.  All right.  Yes.  We've got a very busy show.  We do.  Jimmy's talking about hookers on Sean Hannity. 
[00:03:00]  We've got to get to that.  Yes, I was.  We've got a new iPad that we've got to talk about for a little while.  The iPad 2.  I love Apple.  Let me buy it again.  Yeah.  Industries.  We've got a Charlie Sheen rap song.  It was inevitable.  Oh, no.  Of course it was inevitable.  And speaking of music, we also have Kim Kardashian's horrendous song.  But why did you say speaking of music?  That's a good point.  That has nothing to do with music.  She drives me crazy because...  She drives me crazy. 
[00:03:30]  Because she's just a hot piece of ass with no talent.  And she makes fucking millions and millions of dollars.  That was her...  And now she's trying to move into, like, music, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good luck.  They all do, though.  They all try that.  Like, all the hot, kind of, do-nothing-but-just-be-hot girls.  They go like, I can sing.  And then they auto-tune the shit out of them, throw them in the studio, and it's horrid. 
[00:04:00]  Well, Paris Hilton did that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, that really took off, didn't it?  Remember she was a pop star for a month or two?  Yeah.  What was her song?  She was good.  Stars Are Blind.  That was nice.  You liked it, Jimmy?  You liked it?  Yes.  Do we have Stars Are Blind?  It was melodic.  Melodic.  That was horrible.  Well, no.  It was really good.  It was so good that she never did another song after that.  It's better just to leave it.  It's hard to follow that.  That's so good.  Good point.  It's like following Stairway to Heaven.  E-Rock, just pull it off your iPod.  All right.  Thank you.  Do we have Stars Are Blind?  Here it is.  We just got on the air. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  He had a bet.  Let him be.  Fuck.  Nice.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I actually enjoy this song.  One love.  Let's get together and feel all right.  Hey, I love this song.  What?  Oh.  That's nice.  Whatever it is.  If she's even singing.  I know.  I don't even know if she's singing.  She should be doing live gigs. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And Lulu should put shit on her foot and kick Paris in the vagina.  Lulu.  It's whatever it is.  But you don't even know if it's her singing.  It's very.  They make this shit in the studio.  Yeah.  But the thing is, I got to say, at least it's not auto-tuned, but it's ultra-breathy.  Which is something else these whores do when they put music out. 
[00:05:30]  Very breathy.  It hides a lot.  And the video looks like that old fucking video with that guy and that model on the beach.  Oh.  Chris Isaac.  Yeah.  Yes.  Chris Isaac.  Wicked Games.  E-Rock's back.  E-Rock's back.  He's back.  E-Rock's back.  He's back.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  God damn.  Nice.  Way to interrupt the song, Eric.  What was it?  Wicked Games. 
[00:06:00]  You said it right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was Chris Isaac.  Yeah.  Chris Isaac and that bitch.  That bitch.  She was fucking hot on that beach.  She was hot for like 10 minutes.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think age got her because that song is about 20 years old now.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I think.  It was yesterday for me.  Oh, boy.  Helena Christians.  I guess we got to play the new Kim Kardashian if we played the Paris Hilton.  We might as well.  We might as well.  I can see the criticisms of the Paris Hilton song, but the Kim Kardashian is actually... 
[00:06:30]  Is it good?  It's legit.  All right.  It's decent.  What's the name of it?  My best part is my asshole.  Do-wah.  That's a do-wah song.  What year is this?  A-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Wouldn't that be great if the video is her asshole just opening up to Bowser's voice?  A-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  She opens it like Bowser's mouth and it has teeth in there.  All wide.  It has teeth in there.  I think Jimmy's on to something, though.  Can we make our own breathy song?  Troy Kwan loves music.  He loves songs.  He should do a breathy song. 
[00:07:00]  Could he write a little something that we maybe have Jimmy do a breathy song that we can get  out there?  Because Jimmy's a celebrity, too, and I think he needs to get into that pop world.  I need to have a song.  I think it's time.  You've done everything else.  Movies, TV.  Yeah.  Comedy.  Radio.  Yeah.  Jack of all trades.  Master of none.  I've said that a lot of times.  The big laughs.  Where's Troy Kwan?  Troy Kwan!  Troy Kwan.  I can see his hair sticking above the computer box.  I want to see if he's willing to take on this project. 
[00:07:30]  I bet he is.  He loves a challenge.  Not that this will be a challenge.  He certainly loves music.  He loves doing songs.  That song he put together.  He's combing his hair with a hot glue gun.  Oh, the conspiracy music still.  Wow.  You can't leave that one down, will you?  No.  Troy Kwan, we got something for you.  So all these bimbos, they do their pop song?  Yeah.  And we've got to make believe they actually have talent.  And we noticed they do it very breathy.  So we want Jim Norton to do a breathy song.  And we want to get it out there to the people. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  It's good.  The breathy sound.  Can you write something for Jimmy?  You want it to be an original?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we'll write it together, I think.  Okay.  Collaborate.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Maybe you start out and hand it over to Jim.  He'll tweak it a little bit.  And then we go into the studio and get a breathy version out there.  It's got to be like a love song, like a ballad.  Yeah.  But I want it to have a little pep, too.  I want people to not do it.  Do we dance?  Do we cry?  Maybe the hook can be a little up, and then the chorus is very melodic, very breathy.  And then we'll break it back down.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, shit.  Absolutely.  That sounds great.  You know the songs.  Just like the Charlie Sheen song.  Exactly.  That's right.  I love the Charlie Sheen song.  He did a great job with that.  Of course.  We all love it.  I love it so much.  Don't we?  It's not in front of me anymore.  Fuck.  I want to play it.  Damn it.  Where is it?  God damn.  Where is it?  E-Rock cleared it out?  I know.  I know.  I'm playing out with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children.  I like the music.  It is good.  He didn't do the music.  I can't. 
[00:09:00]  I'm going to play my tootally horn.  I would play along.  Oh, and you never will stop trying.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  The show?  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Enjoy the show.  Newsflash.  I am special, and I will never be one of you.  This is me not on drugs, bro.  I will destroy you in the air, and I will deploy my ordinance onto the ground.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning.  You know?  The first one's free.  The next one goes in your mouth. 
[00:09:30]  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  Oh, wait.  Can't process it.  Losers are winning.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Goodbye.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  It's funny every time.  That was fun to play tootally with.  God, I love that song.  It's a great song.  It was a good one.  It's terrific.  It's got everything.  It's got the music, the laughs. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, that's off to you, Troy.  I don't know why it's not taking off.  I don't know.  It should be viral right now.  Yeah, I agree.  Did you put it on YouTube?  No, I didn't.  Sometimes you can't tell.  Why would you put it on YouTube?  What's wrong?  I know, I should.  It's gotten more plays than anything else I've done here, so I might as well.  You know what?  It's a great song.  Get it on YouTube.  We'll get it out there.  Before this Charlie Sheen thing goes away by Monday.  Troy did mention that, that he put weeks of work into some of the Patrice songs.  He goes, this Charlie Sheen thing I did over the weekend has gotten more airplay than anything. 
[00:10:30]  It literally took me ten minutes to do.  What?  What?  Whoa!  It doesn't sound it.  This guy has a talent.  I think that was number six.  Oh, my God.  Six times that song's gotten played on here.  Wow.  Wow.  Doesn't that remind you of when somebody like Mick Jagger comes out and goes, Satisfaction  was like five minutes.  Yeah.  Like he wrote it on a napkin and just boom.  You're like, fuck.  Keith Richards rolled over one night and went and did the riff.  And did the riff.  I know.  I know the story behind that.  Is that how he got Satisfaction?  Yeah.  It's like, bam.  And he happened to have a tape recorder near his bed. 
[00:11:00]  I guess that's what he used to do.  And he said, oh, wow.  I just fucking heard this riff in my dream and went and did it.  And that was it.  And that's what's the new story.  And that's what's the new story.  Yeah.  That's the Satisfaction.  Troy, it's a terrific song.  Let's get it on YouTube.  Let's go to the next level.  Oh, let's go.  Let's go.  And that way we can open it up to comments and stuff.  Yeah, let me know when it's up there so we can pass it on to the listeners.  Yeah, we'll do.  They know how to make something viral, so let's get it going.  Sam doesn't want those tweets going away anytime soon, does he?  And you're going to be working on the Jim Norton song, right? 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  Yes, we'll get started on that right away.  I have to say my voice.  Jimmy, can you give us a little something?  I just think I want me something.  You sound like Gollum.  I don't know.  Precious, you've treated me so bad.  That's good, see?  Are you getting a feel for it, Troy?  Yeah.  Just trying to figure out the direction we're going to go.  Yeah.  I want to pep it up to, I miss you. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, God.  I miss you.  I miss what?  I want to put like a little British pep in there, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lots of reverb, lots of delay.  Yeah.  And I'll make it just sound very, very.  I don't want an auto-tune.  I don't want to sound like a jizz bag.  No, no.  Dude, you'll sound like a million bucks.  You're going to sound a little English in there.  I want to.  Bury the vocals in music.  Hey, I got something that Jimmy once did at K-Rock, if you want to hear it.  Is it a song?  Oh, this is a great song.  You might not remember this.  I do not.  One, two, three, four. 
[00:12:30]  Tell me that you love me more.  It's a sleepless long night.  That was what my youth was for.  Oh, teenage hopes arrive at your door.  Left you with nothing, but they want some more.  Oh, oh, oh, you're changing your heart.  Oh, oh, oh, you know who you are.  You have to turn that off, Gregory.  I always get emotional when I hear feist. 
[00:13:00]  I can't listen to feist without getting all teary-eyed.  Why is Troy still in here?  I don't know.  Oh, oh, oh, that's awkward.  That's awkward.  There he goes.  Wow.  He was starting to feel a little too comfortable.  Yeah, well, you fixed that.  He's like, wow, I'm just hanging with the guys.  One of the guys.  What are we going to talk about next? 
[00:13:30]  Kim Kardashian.  Yes.  For what it's worth, Perez Hilton gave this song a glowing review.  Really?  And that's true.  Well, because he's gay.  He's decided to, instead of putting cum bubbles on all the celebrities' faces,  now he's going to be their best friend.  Very strange.  Oh, I like that.  It's about positivity.  Yeah, he's drastically changed, and he's really not happy that there's a lot of neck.  A lot of negativity out there, and a lot of haters, when he was the king of the haters.  Yeah, of course.  So now he's like everyone's friend. 
[00:14:00]  And then the celebrities are just accepting it, which is very, very strange.  They don't want to be made fun of.  They forgot that this guy used to draw dicks and cum bubbles on their faces.  But then that kid killed himself, and Perez was kind of in a quandary.  Right.  Because just like when he denied saying faggot to, I think, Will.i.am and the Black Eyed Peas,  now he had this problem of being a hypocrite.  Yeah, bullying.  Yeah.  It's all about bullying.  And then you've got this Ryan Seacrest, who seems to be very popular these days.  Oh, you bet he is.  And he's sucking up to the Kardashians.  I understand.  Well, he's more than sucking up to the Kardashians. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, he's the executive producer on all their reality shows.  I can handle this.  What's with the Ryan Seacrest?  Yeah, that's the reason.  I mean, yeah, he produces all those fucking shows.  But come on, man.  Just be honest once.  This song sucks.  But he's pumping it up like it's a great thing.  Oh, is he?  He's going to make money on it, probably.  Probably is.  Well, here's the Kim Kardashian song.  It's a jam.  Turn it up.  As premiered on Ryan Seacrest's radio show.  Oh, premiered. 
[00:15:00]  Is that her already?  I don't know.  I hear something in the background.  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, God.  A producer and a gunshot?  Is that...  Turn me up.  Turn me up.  Turn me, turn me, turn me up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Turn me up.  Turn me up.  Turn me, turn me.  Turn me up, yeah.  She can't even give it her all.  She's like talking.  She wants to be turned up.  Let me tell you something.  It's really annoying.  It's like...  It's not like you listen to it and go...  And go, ah, she sucks.  She's not...  Like the beat and everything.  It's annoying me.  Right.  Well, she is hot as all hell.  No one can like that.  But she is a fucking bore.  And even with this song, you can tell she's just like... 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  That's like playing out of big speakers at Gitmo.  That's what they should be doing.  Blasting this thing out.  Grating.  Oh.  It's horrible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going out tonight.  It's going down, headed straight to the front of the line.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fly on the floor.  I can't stand still.  I'm not putting anything into it.  I'm going to work like I'm paying my bills.  Did you hear that?  What?  Going to work like I'm paying my bills. 
[00:16:30]  That's right.  Because she has no idea what that's like, right?  She doesn't know.  She can't realize.  I'm going to work like I'm paying my bills or something.  She's never had a pay bill in her life.  Oh, what is she talking about?  Jesus Christ.  Look at my father's face when O.J. walks out the door. 
[00:17:00]  Exactly.  He should have stabbed that bitch some more.  He knew he was guilty to the core.  This song is a snore.  It's awful.  My asshole is all I'm good for.  Kim is getting real.  Yeah, she sure is.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam. 
[00:17:30]  Two more times.  They play in my jam.  Is it skipped?  Is it skipping like a record player?  It's not.  You've got to put a dime on the needle.  I think the stylus is skipping.  At least she went deep with the lyrics and really kind of got into her soul.  Yeah, you could hear it.  Oh, it's horrendous.  She sounds like she's sitting there and singing in between chewing gum.  Like she's like...  Looking at her watch.  Well, they play in her jam.  Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, DJ. 
[00:18:00]  Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.  So I can rock the night away.  Rock the night away.  Away.  No one sings like that.  I'd love to hear the raw tracks of this.  Oh, God.  Holy kidding, man.  Holy fuckaroni.  Someone who hates her has got to release those.  Yeah, please.  We beg you.  Send them our way.  Once that fucking cash cow is done. 
[00:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  On air with Ryan Seacrest.  Oh, they play that in the middle of the song?  Yeah, they play it like two or three times.  Yeah, because, wow, you know, we might have to play this.  We should do that in the middle of a dick joke.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, so her pussy was fucking dripping this white shit.  You know how it gets around the base of your dick and drips down your balls?  The Opie and Anthony show.  And it really smells bad.  Just in case other DJs want to play our stuff.  Right, right.  Just like Ryan Seacrest.  Just like Ryan Seacrest.  Incidentally, if you said this shit's dripping, 
[00:19:00]  but out of her pussy, you wouldn't need to say the Opie and Anthony show.  That's kind of self-branding.  Yes, it really is.  We cornered the market on that.  Yeah, no one else.  World premiere.  Come by live via satellite  And all I see is angels in my eyes  And the buzz got me way up in the sky  My mind is made back in the front  She has no fucking energy.  There's nothing to that.  There's auto-tuned.  Over-the-top auto-tuning. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, the auto-tuning is awful.  I'm trying to find something like that.  Wow.  Perez Hilton's review of it was actually,  There's not too much auto-tune.  What?  Seriously.  What a liar.  Is he talking at the end of this?  Right.  No.  DJ, here I am.  DJ, here I am.  Feeling good, feeling great, just got...  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam. 
[00:20:00]  They play in my jam.  They play in my jam.  Wow.  They play in my jam.  It's infuriating.  Wow, they are playing her jam.  Yeah, that's all they are.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  DJ, here I am.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  So lock it up.  They said turn it up.  She sure did.  I'll turn it up.  Hey, girls in the building.  Fellas in the club.  Fellas in the club.  She's singing about the club. 
[00:20:30]  Have you guys ever been to a club on your payday while they're playing your jam?  Oh, yeah.  That was fantastic.  It's old hat.  Old hat.  It's old hat.  I like going out onto the floor in the club and going, give me some elbow room, kids.  Any comments, anybody?  No.  Y'all play in my jam.  Are we done with it?  No.  What?  I love that song.  Burn me a copy, please.  You actually want more?  I can put it back in.  Oh, God, please.  No. 
[00:21:00]  It is.  I mean, it's decent.  I don't even know what it's decent.  I don't even know where we were.  That's horrible.  You really want to hear more of this?  No.  Okay, good.  In the club.  But you know what?  It'll make another million dollars for her.  Ah, I'm sure.  More money rolling in for her and Ryan Seacrest.  Just a world we don't understand.  That is.  And then Ryan has to play it up.  I mean, if you're on the radio and you get a copy of this, you've got to beat it up.  Yeah, what is it?  But, yeah, he does back the whole thing.  You can beat that beat up, maybe.  But beyond that, you know what? 
[00:21:30]  You know what?  I like that one.  Pauly D's song?  I like the Pauly D.  Beat the beat up?  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up.  Can we hear that?  Beat that beat up.  That's yours.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  This isn't the Kim Kardashian song?  No, this is Pauly D's song.  All right, you made it out.  That's the whole thing? 
[00:22:00]  Pretty much.  Okay, it's time to beat that beat up.  Just nonsense.  I also like this one.  I saw the sign.  Oh, classic.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  I forgot how great that is. 
[00:22:30]  I did forget.  I did not forget, man.  I would rather hear that than Kim Kardashian's song.  Oh, yes.  God damn, that's a classic.  We got to get that contest back.  What was that?  MacBook Karaoke.  MacBook Karaoke?  We got to bring that back.  Please.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign. 
[00:23:00]  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  I'll see you.  That's that breathiness.  She gets all breathy with a really cheap microphone.  Yeah, if Troy's listening, that's the kind of breathiness we need on Jimmy's song.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you just hear it without the windscreen on it, so it's just a deep wind.  Sounds like the Weather Channel when they report from a hurricane.  It's horrid.  We got to get an update on her. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, what happened to her?  Was that her name?  Pamela.  Pamela.  Pamela.  I don't remember her last name.  She was in college at the time, right?  No, I saw the sign.  She probably has kids now.  I wonder if she has a pop career somewhere.  Ah.  I would imagine.  A budding pop career.  I'm sorry, but my favorite of all time is We Deliver Keggers.  We Deliver Keggers.  I saw the sign.  It's probably a close second, but Nicky's We Deliver Keggers is one for the ages, man.  I love that, though.  Saw the Swoines. 
[00:24:00]  I just wish Auto Tune had been popular when we knew her.  We didn't know.  We could have done a million things with her.  We didn't know.  You might want to give that to Troy Kwan.  See if you can pump it up.  Pump up, I Saw the Swoines.  The Music Man on the Only Anthony Show.  And it opens up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demand.  She was articulating.  I saw the sign.  Yes.  One more time.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes. 
[00:24:30]  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you back to get into the light where you belong.  I'm used to you, you belong.  See, she has passion.  She does.  Kim Kardashian just called it in.  She worked that.  Well, now I got to do a pop song?  All right.  I could give you a half hour.  She worked that song.  She certainly did.  She wants to be there.  It was breathy.  There was a little emotion behind it.  She was doing a little dance when she was doing it.  Some energy.  It was fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  Where is she now?  And she can perform live.  I want to Where Are They Now? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, we got to do a few Where Are They Now's.  Maybe we have a week of Where Are They Now's.  Everyone except Bobo.  Yeah.  Well, we want, like...  Because hopefully it'll be under a bus wheel.  Do people miss him?  Bobo?  No, nobody misses him.  I don't think so.  In fact, everybody's going to get pissed off that we brought his name up today.  You see when he tweets and it's like, oh, we just want to get back on the show.  And people just like, shut the fuck up and die.  That's the one time I stopped getting angry tweets when everybody just tweets me and tells 
[00:25:30]  me to kill Bobo instead.  Do you get a lot of angry tweets?  Yes, a lot of angry tweets.  People hate you?  Hate.  Especially yesterday.  I mean, yesterday, I got all day, I was getting threats of violence and death and just requests  to have my job removed from the company.  They didn't like the way I treated E-Rock.  Well, I thought it was terrific.  I didn't think I did anything out of line.  Did you see Bobo's tweet yesterday?  All the misspellings?  Oh, yeah.  I know we don't want to bring up Bobo.  It's beyond me. 
[00:26:00]  There was like five or six words that weren't even close to story.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you know why that is, actually?  Because he's fucking dumb.  That's right.  The answer was because he's retarded.  It was A, the R word.  The R word.  We took the pledge.  Take the pledge about the R word, okay?  I pledge to call Bobo retarded every day until he dies.  I didn't think that was the pledge.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're going to make out.  I pledge allegiance to the retarded.  No, that's not the word.  You're going to make Al Roker very mad.  Bobo is... 
[00:26:30]  Al Roker actually yesterday, because someone brought it to his attention that we were beating  him up again yesterday.  Oh, really?  And Al Roker goes, tell those guys, I said hi, are they still on the air somewhere?  Good one.  Oh, really?  That's what Al Roker had to say.  That's good.  Are they still on the air?  Yes, we're doing stomach staple radio, you dumb fucking fatso.  No fucking willpower douchebag.  Stop trying to have a fucking, stop trying to mean something.  Here's your whole job.  Ah, it's raining!  Thank you, fat boy.  Oh, thank you, chubby weatherman. 
[00:27:00]  Thank you, I want to be fat boy.  He's struggling to not be fat again.  He really is.  To not be fat again.  How hard is that every day, huh?  You look at food, want to shove it in your fat fucking head?  Are they still on the air somewhere?  Sorry we don't have a weatherman gig on the Today Show, you fucking albatross.  Yeah.  Trying so hard to fucking mean something on his blog.  Stop it.  Because they don't want to hear you in studio.  What's the matter?  They give him a cooking segment now, so that's terrific.  Of course they do.  Oh, that's great.  After 40 years on TV, they finally gave him a little cooking segment, too, with stuff he 
[00:27:30]  can't eat.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Because you know Al can't control himself.  Al.  You would eat the whole fucking plate, wouldn't you, Al?  Oh, my God.  Al.  Yeah, we're still on the air, fatso.  Joe Jonas made a pledge to stop using the R word.  Who?  Joe Jonas.  From the Jonas Brothers?  I have pledged to stop using the R word.  Have you?  Take the pledge at r-word.org.  Can we go there?  R-word.org.  Stop using the R word.  I took the pledge to stop using the R word. 
[00:28:00]  Stop using the words with the letters.  Could we just stop doing that and be adults?  Right.  Roly-poly.  That's the word Al's going to stop using.  The R word.  Wouldn't the campaign be more successful if they said, I'm not going to say retard anymore?  Yeah.  Instead of the R word?  Dash word.  I guess.  What?  I get scared.  You know, badly, I want to make one of those R word pledge videos just to read the comments  I would get.  Org.  It's org, Danny.  My God.  It's org.  Exactly.  That's the sound they make.  There's the joke right there. 
[00:28:30]  It's not going to get better than that.  Oh, I knew it.  There it is.  Take the pledge.  Spread the word.  Spread the word to end the word.  Yeah.  Should I click on the pledge?  Pledge.  Let's see the pledge.  What is it?  I pledge...  Well, I don't want to say it.  Say it!  No, because then I won't be allowed to say retards.  It's not like the Necromonicon, fucker.  If you were to take this, you would pledge and support the elimination of the derogatory use  of the R word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with 
[00:29:00]  intellectual disabilities.  Is that what it's called?  Intellectual disabilities.  Intellectual disabilities.  Okay.  But they don't want that pointed out.  That's going to be the intellect.  Yeah.  That's going to be the next problem, that you're pointing that out.  ID words.  So how many words have we lost?  But you are retarded.  It's okay to be retarded.  It doesn't mean you're a bad person.  You're dialed back a little.  You're a little not quite there.  Are they going to include them in all their things?  Are the people taking the pledge going to hire them in the bank as tellers? 
[00:29:30]  Are you going to have them run your offices?  Are you going to give them jobs as police officers?  You just played Joe Jonas, right?  Yes.  Is that what you said?  Yeah.  So why doesn't Joe Jonas hire one of these tards to go on tour and do a little something?  You're using a t-word.  Yeah.  Just because you made the r-word pledge doesn't mean you can use the t-word.  You made the t-word.  Thank you.  Well, I'm smart.  Holy shit.  That is really...  I'm not going to use that word anymore, certainly.  Tard.  Tard.  So why doesn't Joe Jonas hire a tard?  It's going to be a whole line of pledges. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  I promise I no longer say the r-word.  From now on, I'll just call them dumb bellows.  How about dunderheads?  Dunderhead.  Can we make our own video?  Well, today, we got to make the pledge and go, look, we want to suggest some other words  because the retard word is not working anymore.  I want to go with tard, dunderhead.  What was yours?  Dumbbellow.  Dumbbellow.  Yes!  Stupid!  Oh, sorry.  Tard.  But in all this, Jimmy makes a really good point. 
[00:30:30]  It means nothing if you just say, I'm not going to use the r-word anymore.  Why don't you fucking hire somebody with a disability?  You certainly wouldn't do that.  You certainly wouldn't bring one of these people in your inner circle.  Or date one of them.  That's why it's so fucking fake and it's all bullshit.  A Jonas brother dating a retard?  But I'm saying, no, no, no.  But I mean, if you're that sincere...  Bumbo can't get laid for shit.  How about you date somebody with intellectual disability?  Oh, that's great.  Oh, wait, I guess so.  That's not attractive.  That's not sexy.  Again, stop being this fucking phony statements. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, Al Roker should say it because it applies to him.  Oh, God.  The r-word, really unimportant.  Are they still on the air somewhere?  The r-word, rain, fat boy.  Tell us about it.  Tell us about it.  Should I bring my galoshes?  Stand out there with an umbrella, piggy.  Stand out there on the beach as the wind is blowing through your fucking non-hair,  your fucking thermometer-sized skull.  But there you go.  I mean, that's the point, if they really care. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see Joe Jonas.  I'm sure a lot of these kids with disabilities can't find a gig anywhere.  And Joe Jonas is a very powerful person, so why don't you hire a few?  Could you see him going, yeah, there's my girl in the front row!  And they just pan the camera over, and you just see some drooling fucking idiot sitting there.  We should get Bobo to make a video asking Joe Jonas for a job as a backup singer.  I could do that.  I saw your pledge.  I saw your pledge. 
[00:32:00]  Or have Bobo just an overall video for all the people that are pledging to not use the r-word.  Thank you.  Could you take a step further and hire me?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's do it.  I don't know if we could get Bobo.  He's hard to get.  I live in Queens, and I need a job.  Tell Bobo if he could get on a fucking subway today.  Well, he's really pissed at Travis, Bobo is.  Why?  Who isn't?  Because Travis, he, he, Travis.  Did Travis kick him in the bulls? 
[00:32:30]  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I don't even know what that means.  You're going to get a talking to him on your way to the elevator, like I did.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  You're not supposed to mention that.  No, because he called Travis.  But from who?  I don't remember.  From them, or?  No, them.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, let's make believe shit doesn't happen.  It was great.  I know.  It's the biggest thing to do.  That's the weirdest thing.  Let's just make believe it didn't happen.  Take it out of the replay.  And I yell at these guys. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, it already happened.  It happened.  What do you mean take it out of the replay?  It happened.  What are you going to go?  Whatever.  Well, the reason he's upset is because Travis was doing his job as a producer on this show  and saying, you know, Car Crash Comedy is coming up.  Bobo called him, like, yesterday or two days ago, demanding to be a part of Car Crash Comedy.  And Travis said, it's over.  It's like, we've already filled the slots.  You can't be in this contest.  Yeah, this has been going on for some time now because Bobo has become very used to coming 
[00:33:30]  on this program.  Whenever any event happens.  Right.  So, I mean, when we told him that he could be a part of it, he needs to submit like everyone  else.  Yeah, we told him weeks ago, make a tape, email it in, and you can be submitted like  anybody else and we'll judge it and whatever.  But I'm special.  Exactly.  Well, he never did.  So then we told him that he wasn't, you know, he could not participate.  And then he just started demanding to be part of the audience.  And we said, well, all those spots are filled. 
[00:34:00]  And he couldn't understand why we weren't giving him special treatment.  Not only could he not understand why we weren't giving him special treatment, but he was upset  that we didn't let him know that we were going to be soliciting for audience numbers.  You can't comprehend the life like blind.  Like I have to tell you every time we're going to do something instead of every other  listener who emailed me and got themselves a spot in the audience.  So you were getting upset that Bobo was being an idiot?  I was being upset because Bobo's got a little ego on him. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, and a big, yeah, a big ego.  And he thinks that, you know, he just deserves a little penis, big ego.  Now that he's entitled to all this stuff, it looks like his penis looks like a dog toy  that needs to be replaced.  And it gets to that point where it's like, oh, this needs to be thrown away.  All right.  So no Bobo today.  Fuck it.  Today we can have Bobo today.  No, not on the air, but a video to like begging for a job from all these assholes pledging  not to use the R word anymore. 
[00:35:00]  Him just shaking his arms back.  I think full body shot, not just his head.  Do like a couple of transitions.  He misses you.  Yeah, where he pulls his finger out of his hand.  Points.  By the way, he figures if he just gets a chance to talk to Opie and Anthony, he'll be able  to come in for Car Crash Comedy.  Oh, you guys have been blowing, you've been throwing up a roadblock.  He thinks that where the cock block is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So do you guys, let's get this straight for Bobo.  Opie and Anthony, do you want Bobo to come in on the air on the show?  So after the break, we're going to play Jimmy on Sean Hannity. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  Talking about prostitutes.  Very good.  Why that motherfucker like hookers so much?  Yeah, we should take a break.  What the hell?  Jimmy had a great appearance on Sean Hannity's show last night.  Retalk gotta eat.  And one of the guys with you certainly wasn't happy about your comments on Charlie Sheen.  Yes, see, the Reverend was not happy, nor was the lady next to me.  They were very nice, but they were not pleased with yours truly. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, we'll get a little insight on that after the break.  And also a brand new Charlie Sheen rap song.  Oh, great.  Love the Charlie Sheen songs.  They're fantastic.  Before we play the rap song, when we get back, we should play the Troy song.  I fucking love that song.  That's a great song.  I'm not playing it to break, because I want to enjoy it.  Right.  Because during the break, I've got to go make duties.  I want to hear this fucking Troy song again, man.  Yeah, it is good.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:36:30]  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Let's get into it.  Yeah.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  What?  Get R-worded.  Ha!  Let's get retarded.  In here.  Let's get retarded.  What's happened?  What's happened?  What's happened?  I don't know.  I don't want to ever see you again.  Don't laugh at me.  You're stupid. 
[00:37:00]  Why did you do that?  Why did you spend everyone loving me?  It's music day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  What the hell?  We got a lot of them.  I want to hear some Kenny songs today.  Let's make it music day.  Is that all right with everyone?  Why not?  So, E-Rock, if you got some Kenny, Club Soda Kenny is terrific with his stuff.  Big A?  We haven't done a Big A one yet.  A Big E.  A Big E. 
[00:37:30]  Who, fuck, man.  He's losing weight.  I'm stepping out of character right now.  That's good.  This motherfucker has lost 80 pounds.  Yeah.  And he's telling everyone he's feeling much better.  And he was in a tough spot.  A very serious spot.  Yeah.  So, I'm not fucking making any jokes right now.  I just want Big A to know, keep it up, brother.  Keep it up.  He, yeah, he tweeted that.  Yeah, because he needs the support.  Because I guarantee you, he just wants to be eating how he used to.  And he's sticking to it.  His house needs support.  It's support. 
[00:38:00]  What the hell?  His band needs support.  I guess we do need it.  Let's try the mask out real quick.  Oh, no.  Really?  All right.  Quick, and then we'll explain.  All right.  We're trying to.  Oh, wait.  I don't know if it's going to work yet.  All right.  I don't think it's ready.  How much do you want to do?  Fuck, I'm going to video check for them.  No, we didn't just cut to some other show.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We will explain this.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Just hold it for a second.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It's got to be, it's got to be videoed.  Here we go.  Ready?  Should we just fart? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, this came off.  Wait, the fucking thing came off.  Help me.  Put, put it back.  No, it won't stink.  It won't stink?  No, it won't be enough.  I felt it slip out the top of my crack.  No, I'm not getting it.  No, see?  No, you're not getting it.  I felt his air blow back out of my skin.  Oh, wait.  He just got it.  He just got some.  Oh, did you get some?  It works.  Oh, yay.  Yay.  Pudding.  Oh, no.  Wait, what happened, Danny?  You're welcome.  It's our new...  I was expecting to just continue... 
[00:39:00]  Oh, that's the mic's not on.  No.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  I was expecting to continue just sniffing the plastic because it has like a very plasticky  smell.  And then all of a sudden, like the last big breath that I was like, I'll try it one more  time and I'm giving up.  I was like, oh, there it is.  All right.  Dr. Steve was kind enough to make a mask that was supposed to be for a deadliest snatch so  we could take sniffs off of the snatches.  It is a mask that you would put on if you were under anesthesia.  Like an anesthesia mask covers the mouth. 
[00:39:30]  It's got a hose that comes out of it.  And on the other end is another little mask that Jimmy had on his asshole.  And Danny put, strapped this first mask on and it's connected with a tube.  A little surgical fucking, a little vacuum cleaner looking tube.  And it's to smell farts now.  It was supposed to be for deadliest snatch, but Jimmy put it on his asshole and Danny put  it on his face and he got a great whiff of Jimmy's fart. 
[00:40:00]  And you know what's weird is when Danny laughed at one point, I felt his air blow back against  my asshole.  It was so awful.  And then here's the problem with that, though.  The way I had it over my asshole, this is behind the, kind of behind the scenes footage.  I felt half the fart escape up my spine.  Oh.  A little rascal made a run for it.  A little rascally fart.  Made a run for it.  Yeah, it sure did.  Yeah, it's, uh. 
[00:40:30]  Well, for the first try, not bad.  It definitely works.  We can improve on it.  We definitely have proof of concept.  Really?  You did smell it?  Absolutely.  There's definitely proof of concept here.  With a real nasty one and a lot of volume to it, that would be sick.  That would have been a lot better, because I was kind of frustrated with the strap that  kind of attaches it to the back of your head.  So I was just kind of holding it to my face, so it was very easy for me to escape that.  Right.  But if this was, like, on my head, like, that would have been not fun. 
[00:41:00]  We have to do it.  Like, if somebody fucks up, they have to put on the mask.  And take a Jimmy fart.  And by the way, the mask will entail putting it on with the strap and maybe being handcuffed  behind your back so you can't take it off.  So you can't even take it off.  That would be horrible.  Jimmy, are you going to have another one in you?  Medieval torture.  I tell you, I mean, I'm trying to eat better, but for the show, I would eat a little ice cream.  For the show.  For the show.  But I will say, if I eat a little ice cream, I'll be clearing my throat a lot. 
[00:41:30]  But...  And you'll be clearing your asshole a lot.  Let me just say this.  My asshole will become a beehive of activity.  Can we get this done today?  I'm sure we can.  You need ice cream?  Yes, I do.  What's your flavor of choice?  I don't know, but I like to say ice cream, you scream, we all scream when being raped.  I just made that up.  Yay!  Where's Kenny?  We need ice cream.  I don't know.  But hopefully wherever he is, he's suffering with a shin injury.  I hope Kenny went to get on the elevator and his shin got caught in the door and he ripped  up his fucking...  Oh, there he is. 
[00:42:00]  He's just fine, unfortunately.  Here he is.  Kenny, we need ice cream, because we've got to test out our fart mask.  It works swimmingly well.  Yes, it did.  I'm going to have a little ice cream.  Even though we all know I've been hitting the gym lately, let's all acknowledge my face  looks thinner.  Okay.  Oh, I got something for that.  Ooh.  Hopefully it's a big kiss.  Oh, there it is.  Didn't work.  Danny just put the mask on.  Particular flavor?  I don't know.  What do you think might make me fart?  I think just chocolate.  No, because chocolate bothers my reflux. 
[00:42:30]  Vanilli?  How about maple walnut?  Strawberry?  How about Rocky Road?  Rocky Road?  A little bit of Rocky.  Marshmallow swirl?  Chocolate chip cookie dough.  Chocolate chip cookie dough?  Yeah, you need an ice cream with a lot going on in it.  Yeah, but a small one.  Even for the show, I can't be eating all of this.  Oh my God, I can't wait for the farts to start.  Will the sound go through the tube?  Me either.  Put the thing on the other end of the mic and go away from the mic and talk.  Let me see.  Can you hear me better?  This is like engine room, engine room.  You know what, Kenny? 
[00:43:00]  Here's what we're going to do for the show.  This is how I feel about the show.  Out with the old coffee.  Yeah, bye.  Oh, shit.  And I would like to have a little more coffee, but with half and half.  Oh, shit.  Oh, half and half.  That does it.  And the sugar.  Oh, shit.  And a little thing of Rocky Road.  Chocolate chip cookie dough.  And what about some grapes?  No, grapes will do it for me.  Oh, grapes.  Anybody have any cum?  Not for that reason.  It won't help.  It just means a reward.  I'm not going to be volunteering to take on all this gas.  I think Sam should take one, because Sam is such a little bitch. 
[00:43:30]  Danny's the Mythbuster type.  You're the Mythbuster guy.  Yeah, you really are.  This is made for you, Danny.  Danny's going to try out this mask.  What myth is being busted that a fart can travel through a tube?  Is he gay?  Are you doing ass to mouth with a tube?  Actually, to be fair, I mean, I'll take all the farts that Jimmy has to offer.  Wow.  But I'm so incredibly used to them, because I sit in here, I smell them.  You weren't used to it.  You fell over on the chair back then.  It was so concentrated.  It was my mouth. 
[00:44:00]  It knocked you over.  I got horrible videos, so hopefully Jimmy will get another fart going,  so we could make a proper video.  Please isolate that.  You'll never hear that again.  Yeah, something tells me he will.  Huh?  Oh, good.  Something tells me he'll get it.  I'm under pressure.  Do you have a lot of confidence?  I really do, because I can feel the little bacteria in my colon already.  I can actually hear the little work whistle blow.  Vinny is very correct from Northwest Indiana.  First fucking instant feedback from Northwest Indiana.  Fiber One bars.  I had to give up on those fuckers. 
[00:44:30]  That is some serious gas shit.  I don't want to eat too much stuff.  I just know ice cream makes me...  You'd have to do it for the show.  I'll tell you what would get me, although they're not available now.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  A White Castle burger or something like that, but I won't eat them.  The show.  What's going to make you start farting?  I think ice cream might, because I very, very rarely, if ever, have that kind of milk.  Are you lactose intolerant?  I must be.  I must be.  Oh, no.  I really must be.  Because literally when I shit after eating ice cream, I have to stand so the Carville-like 
[00:45:00]  fucking swirl doesn't tap me back on the asshole.  That's like matter meeting anti-matter.  They should never touch.  Yeah, that's good.  I've done an hour and eight minutes and shit.  And it's only been on for an hour and nine minutes.  A boo.  The fart gas.  That thing is hilarious, though, man.  Who got that?  Dr. Steve?  We should make it shorter.  Yeah, Dr. Steve made that.  Can we make that shorter?  That should be a lot shorter.  No, I kind of like that you could smell someone's fart from across the room.  But I'm telling you, he smelled it. 
[00:45:30]  It definitely works just fine.  If you had it, you said that your positioning was off.  If you had that directly positioned comfortably, it would be perfect.  Well, there was a panic that happened, because Jimmy knew he didn't have much time, and he  had to set up the apparatus around his asshole, and Danny had to put the other end around  his face.  Yeah, well, it's like the strapping that holds it to your head.  It's a little cumbersome, let's say.  It's a little difficult to throw on.  It doesn't matter, Travis, does this have to be approved? 
[00:46:00]  Yes, are the lawyers calling in, because they want to come down and enjoy it?  No, I just want to make sure.  I'm going to run down to Dwayne Reed and get you some ice cream.  But they also have, at most Dwayne Reeds, they have those frozen White Castle burgers.  Are you sure you don't want them?  No, I'm not yet.  That's too much.  I don't eat that.  A, I don't trust that.  And B, a little ice cream is one thing, but a fucking white...  Another package.  They're fine.  Don't trust it.  You don't need a B.  A McDonald's hamburger.  Literally, if I ate a McDonald's hamburger before the last pickle went down, it would be  a ffff fest.  You know what? 
[00:46:30]  They serve burgers for breakfast at Burger King now.  Oh.  No, they don't do it to be McDonald's.  Something McDonald's.  Yeah.  It's probably the kangaroo feet.  But the problem there is it's diarrhea, not farts.  Oh, no, it's farts.  Oh, fuck.  I love eating those.  Me and Kenny come back on late night runs, like driving back from Boston, there's nothing  open.  Yeah.  But McDonald's?  McDonald's.  You want a Tofutti?  Mickey D's.  No, they don't do it because they don't know.  Cootie Cuties, remember those?  They're good, but there's no milk in them.  How about a milkshake from McDonald's?  No, it's too fatty.  Oh, my God.  Too much.  A little ice cream is one.  A chocolate shake from McDonald's. 
[00:47:00]  What about a smoothie?  Is that to it?  No, let's just get the ice cream.  I remember when I used to get smoothies every day, and I would start percolating about  10 minutes after the smoothie and be like, why did I just eat that?  I would drink it.  Well, you just got to fart into it, not rocket a shit down it.  That would be great, though.  A bunch of shit, the mask is on, and just comes through the tube at your face.  I would love that.  You know that's what it would end up being with us.  Yeah, we're making a fucking centipede. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, we're going to get bored with the fucking fart thing.  All right, go get the ice cream, Travis.  Let's get this going.  Yes.  In the meantime...  And bring me back a cowlick.  In the meantime, Jimmy was on Sean Hannity.  Yes.  And Sean just loves the program, loves Jimmy Norton.  He's very supportive of the show.  He's very, very supportive of the show.  The show.  Yeah, he's great.  He called me after Homeless Charlie and basically told me to tell everybody to cut the shit. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  He was very angry with the radio show when we almost got fired for the Homeless Charlie bit.  And called me personally.  He's like, I'm very concerned about you and the rest of the guys.  You guys got to cut the shit.  And Sean Hannity doesn't really curse.  Yeah.  But I'm telling you right now, he was cursing because he was that mad.  That was...  He didn't want us to go away again for some reason.  That was a while ago.  Thank God.  And I thought, what a stand-up guy that he was so concerned. 
[00:48:30]  He searched us out and made sure we got the message.  Yeah.  Wait.  It's similar.  Oh, my God.  It's similar.  It's the same thing.  No, it's pretty much the same thing.  Oh, wow.  I've never seen that.  It's Steve-O.  Oh, is that Jackie?  I've never seen that.  Oh.  Steve-O wearing a fart mask.  He's got a fart helmet on.  It's like a...  Cut the video.  It's like an old...  Yeah.  Cut the video on the video rangers.  Helmet.  I didn't know Jackie did.  Space helmet on.  Oh, no.  Cut the video. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, but I think the fat dude took a dump in it.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He took a dump.  Yeah, I think they show a log in it.  And Steve-O.  Yeah.  Steve-O's breathing it in.  He shit in it.  Oh, my God.  He shit in it.  What a fucking animal.  I was watching Jackass 3, 3D, last night.  In the theater with old school glasses.  Nice.  It was the old school 3D, the red and the blue lens.  That's how they were putting out this Jackass 3D.  That we got yesterday.  When it comes out.  Yeah, it's coming out in a couple of days. 
[00:49:30]  And I wore the glasses and watched it.  And every time we were taking the glasses on and off, we'd pause, you know, take a piss  or something, take the glasses off, we'd be like, ow, oh, oh, paper cut, oh, fuck.  Like, it could chew the top of your ears apart.  Those things are like razor blades.  But I was sitting there like idiots with the 3D glasses on.  And old school 3D, it wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It was very nostalgic to watch some of that old school 3D.  But when that big dildo comes flying at you.  How funny is that? 
[00:50:00]  It was coming right at your face.  When you're in a full theater, that scene fucking kills people just laughing their balls  off, right?  Oh, dying.  Yeah.  Fucking dying.  Yeah, that was cool.  And then you try to move out of the way because your stupid brain gets involved.  It's like, yeah, it's coming out of the way.  And you really can't move out of the way.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's fucking funny, though, man.  There are some great stunts in there.  Great gross-out shit.  The cameraman that kept puking was hysterical.  He couldn't take it.  He threw up on his camera. 
[00:50:30]  There's the pic.  Ah, there it is.  I found that angle to be a little, like, rolly eyes, kind of like a right.  Oh, really?  What?  I had to show the seats?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  The camera guy puking all the time.  Yeah, that was one of those things that hit me as, okay, they needed an angle here, so  let's keep, let's get this.  Oh, the camera guy's all nauseous.  He's going to throw up again.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't know.  There was a few.  I mean, throughout the Jackass series, I suppose, there's been a lot of those.  There's been a few where you're like, eh, a little suspect. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, three, I mean, two, there was a lot of that as well.  Yeah, yeah.  I did get that a bunch of times with the 3D.  The thing with me, anytime people are puking, I'm fucking laughing.  I don't know what it is.  It's always funny.  That gagging, like when Steve-O's throwing up, he makes that gag face and it just lets  loose.  Puking.  Makes me laugh.  There you go.  Jim talks about Charlie Sheen on Sean Hannity last night, and congratulations to Sheen.  One million fucking Twitter followers in less than a day. 
[00:51:30]  Unbelievable.  He did it in less than a day.  But he lost his kids.  Yeah, but he lost his kids.  No, he's got Twitter followers.  He's got over a million new friends and two less kids right now.  Ah, yeah.  That's the latest on Charlie Sheen.  But here's Jimmy on Sean Hannity last night.  He's a comedian whose new CD, Despicable, is out in March, March 8th.  He also is a regular on the OPN Anthony show on XM Sirius Radio.  Jim Norton is back.  Guys, good to see you.  Thank you, Sean.  Good to be back.  I can't wait to get your comments on Charlie Sheen.  So we'll get to that in a second. 
[00:52:00]  And why do I think you probably agree with him?  Because I've done worse things than he has.  No.  Well, all right.  We'll talk about it.  See, he gets really nervous when you're on there.  Oh, he loves you.  He's done stuttering.  Sean always has a little mini panic attack.  Yes.  He loves you, but then he's like, oh, God, I hope I don't get fired for this.  Oh, God, that's Jimmy.  We talked for a few minutes, because some of the stuff is pre-taped, like before our segment.  So we were sitting in the dressing room just rapping and chit-chatting.  But he gets very panicky.  He likes me on Leno and HBO, but he's like, you know, I just know that he's trying to let 
[00:52:30]  me know, like, you can't curse here.  It's like, yeah, his core audience would just be, oh, my God, what is he doing?  What do you think?  How do they take Charlie Sheen's kids when the people in the Westboro church are allowed  to keep theirs?  What's the worst thing he did?  That's actually not a bad point.  He tried to dance after he smoked Coke all night.  That was his biggest crime.  But hang on a second.  You can't do Coke or smoke cocaine when you've got kids.  Sure you can.  I mean, I'm not saying...  You can, but you can't.  I mean...  He's committing the crime of being honest. 
[00:53:00]  And look, if you smoke and Coke, it's stupid.  The prostitutes, let's be honest, we all understand the prostitutes.  I mean, who hasn't spent half their income on prostitutes?  Me.  I have not.  Well, I'm one.  All right, maybe a third, because you make a lot more money than most of us.  Oh, great.  That has nothing to do with the money, but...  Oh, we don't need to have a serious conversation.  What a good line.  Shut the fuck up.  That's a great line.  His crew laughed at him, too.  That was great.  But then you hear her jumping, and we...  Yeah.  We don't need a serious conversation.  How about you keep it fun for a little while, and then we can get to your serious conversation. 
[00:53:30]  Self-destruct.  You wanted to add one point.  Michael Jackson was allowed to keep his kids.  I mean, there was no court proceeding.  It's just something happened.  They came in the middle of the night and took his kids, and it's like...  I don't know.  I'm just tired of everybody acting like Charlie Sheen is so unique.  He's just a guy who's having sex with porn girls, which any of us would do if given the opportunity.  No, no, not any of us.  No.  I would die flattened under a pile of props.  I'd look like a cat in a hoarder's house.  Believe me, that's exactly what I would do. 
[00:54:00]  I love that.  Cat in a hoarder's house.  Smoldy, but I get it.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Did the woman understand at all that you were being funny?  Yeah.  Did they understand funny?  It was a tough point to make because, you know, when you're on those shows, sometimes  you're making a point, and it's like, it sounds like I'm defending a guy doing coke with his  kids there, but I'm not, because I didn't think he did them with the kids there.  And the thing is, they just came and took his kids, and he's not doing it at the moment.  So he's just being honest, talking about, like, this is what I was doing.  And it's like, they didn't take...  I mentioned rappers and stuff, because they didn't take Snoop's kids. 
[00:54:30]  They didn't take...  Like, you know, there's so many people whose kids they didn't take, so stop acting like  this is this big, shocking thing.  I think the whole thing, though, was the mother of the kids was the one that put in the order  that got the kids taken away.  Well, I think they were just at Charlie's house more than they should have been.  I think that's the only reason they went and got them, because they were supposed to  be brought back and they weren't.  Yeah.  It wasn't like this big custody thing where they just removed them from the home forever.  Right.  I think.  But I don't think it was based on his activity that the authorities came in and took the kids. 
[00:55:00]  I think it's like, based on his activity, the mother of the children thought that it's  not good to have the kids there, and then had the authorities.  Why wouldn't they take them after the arrest, or why wouldn't they take them when he was  smoking coke?  You don't take them after the guy just tested negative for drugs.  Well, they were waiting for the million Twitter follower mark.  Wow.  Really?  That's when you take the kids.  And today we present the Charlie Sheen rap song.  Rap song.  Oh, boy.  You knew this was coming, huh?  Of course.  Better than Troy Kwan's?  Well, I'm going to defend Troy Kwan's song. 
[00:55:30]  I think it's terrific.  You are?  Yes.  Oh, you are?  Yes, of course.  Oh, yes.  I hope this doesn't muscle into Troy Kwan's territory.  Turf.  Call it turf.  His turf.  Yeah.  Good already.  We're all equipped.  Hey, kids.  Want to try a little Charlie Sheen?  It's the best drug known to man.  Check it out.  I'm Charlie Sheen.  Got cocaine jaw.  Fuck Brie Olsen.  Did the whole thing wrong. 
[00:56:00]  I get two million every episode.  It's modest for my pay.  I got fire-breathing fists and Adonis DNA.  Fuck AA.  Fuck anybody with cancer.  Fuck porn stars.  Fuck dancers.  You call me an addict and I'll just smile, dream on.  Punk bitch.  I'm the real Ricky Wild thing.  On my line's polar.  It's the ninth inning.  You're bipolar.  I'm bi-winning.  Bangin' seven grand rocks tear my chest apart and you will see that I have three extra hearts.  Doin' 75 pounds of yayo every night that's love.  I win here and I win there.  Doin' 75 pounds of yayo every night that's love.  I got tiger blood.  Charlie Sheen.  Charlie Sheen. 
[00:56:30]  Five foot nine with the heart on clean.  Blinked his eyes and he cured AIDS.  His women and cocaine are pure grade.  Okay, Charlie Sheen.  Charlie Sheen.  Ten foot twenty money large and green.  Lookin' in the mirror like I'm a stud.  Don't fuck with me.  I got tiger blood.  Come on.  I got tiger blood.  We gotta speed things up now.  I got tiger blood.  What is that? 
[00:57:00]  What I hear when a woman talks.  Awesome rapping, yeah.  It's white, oops, it's my life and I'm tired of preaching and igniting my special.  I'm making, I'm clapping, I'm still in effecting.  We're taking a nap on my battle to step back in that double.  I need to love you until we're ice age swimming.  I got tiger blood.  Ice day winning, bitch.  Charlie Sheen.  Charlie Sheen.  Right.  Half man, half horse, half machine.  Idiot.  Camera phone, shooting amateur porn.  Wrote apocalypse now before I was born. 
[00:57:30]  Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen.  Bones made of compressed methamphetamine.  I'm not an actor, bitch.  I'm a drug.  I got five children and tiger blood.  What was that?  That was awful.  I want to apologize.  That was more infuriating.  You guys thought the disc title, Charlie Sheen rap song was going to be really, really good?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  We were hoping.  We were hoping.  There's only one thing we could do at this point.  Is that Courtney Cox now?  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Dude.  What the fuck?  I'm telling you, these broads are looking pretty hot, man.  Jennifer Aniston looks just as hot as she does.  That don't look bad, though.  They're in their 40s.  That's a 40-something.  How old is she now?  40, I would say, 42.  She don't look bad, man.  A little green bikini she wears.  Not bad.  She looks ridiculous.  She's in some shape.  Yes, she is.  I was going to play the Troy Kwan song just to get that bad taste.  Oh, God.  Just to get the bad taste out of her.  Yeah, well.  We don't have to, though.  All right.  She's showing her age on the ass a little bit. 
[00:58:30]  It starts to look like an elephant's ass.  Yeah, it's like mooping and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll happen.  That bitch got an ass like someone's face.  There's certain places on a woman they can't hide.  It's their elbows.  Belbos.  Their knees.  Knees.  And their eyes.  And the A's.  And the A's.  It's right where the ass meets the fucking thigh.  Everything else they could hide, man.  If they got the droopy boobs, they could get the implants.  They could get a little Botox for the face. 
[00:59:00]  They could even stretch the face slightly.  As long as you don't do too many of those facelifts.  But, man, the elbows don't lie.  Demi Moore had a really hot beach picture recently.  And her elbows just gave it all away.  Really?  Yeah.  That's like that Shakira song.  And my elbows don't lie.  Now I need to show you the elbows.  Elbows don't lie.  Let's see.  The elbows gave it away.  Demi.  Whatever.  Is that her?  I didn't think we were going to talk about this today.  I would have found the picture for you. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, that's all right.  Whatever.  She's got bony.  Bony elbows, too.  She's pretty fucking hot.  What's going on there?  Jesus.  Demi?  I don't know.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Come on in.  I know you like little girls, but come on.  Jesus.  I mean, come on.  Would you?  Demi Moore.  Well, you've got to say yes for Demi.  Just for the...  Oh, that might be it.  Is that the elbow picture?  Let's see.  Oh, shit.  Let me see.  It starts to look like a little mouth.  A little mouth. 
[01:00:00]  She has a great rump, though.  It's starting to look like a Homer Simpson mouth on the elbows.  She does have a...  She is quite shapely.  No, she's ridiculous.  From the rear.  Obviously, we're being a little picky.  I mean, look at that.  Yeah, and her elbows are not nice.  She's got a flat ass, though, right?  Let me see.  The ass is small.  Open that up.  I want to see her bent over.  I want to see if I can see any camel toe.  T to the O.  It's no Mila Kunis ass, right, Danny?  With that flat thing.  Mila's is like concave.  What's the one that goes in?  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Concave.  Concave sounds good.  You want a convex ass.  Yeah, it's much convexness.  It needs to happen.  Where's Jimmy's ice cream?  It's coming.  It's on the way.  Oh, let's go.  Yeah.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yum.  The show.  The show.  The show.  All right, so the rap song was a big dud.  That was a bust.  That was a dud-a-roo.  That was a dud-a-roo.  Yeah, that really was a fucking...  That was a flop squared.  What's up with the Charlie Sheen?  A million followers on Twitter.  Over a million.  What is it now?  He's probably 1.1 at this point.  I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  He's probably slowed down a lot.  Danny, where are we at with Charlie Sheen?  One second.  Is he pushing 1.1, I'm thinking?  And he's tweeted a picture of his television.  Yeah, well, I didn't get that one.  With direct TV on it.  But Pong.  1.2.  And he was making peace signs at it.  1.2.  It said Pong.  Wow, 1.2.  Jesus.  Yeah, he's still going.  Wow.  Ready for my next fastball world?  Is that what he's saying?  Yeah.  Plan better applies to everyone.  Plan better applies to everything where an excuse now sits. 
[01:01:30]  Try it.  You won't be wrong.  Face it, folks.  You just feel better when you say it.  Winning.  It's true.  And this is what 1.2 million people feel compelled.  And I'm one of them.  Compelled?  It's more than that.  Power of Sheen compels you.  But he's picking trending topics now.  Plan better is, I'm sure, trending now.  That'll trend.  How many times did you say winning in your life yesterday?  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  I can't stop. 
[01:02:00]  It's crazy.  I can't fucking stop.  Winning.  How many times did you type hashtag winning?  A few times.  On everything.  A few times.  Unlike business fucking shit.  I got takeout yesterday, and I just said to the guy who obviously doesn't have Twitter  or have any clue who Charlie Sheen is, and I just went, winning.  Winning.  And he looked at me like, what?  Winning.  The second you do something and it's cool, you're like, winning.  Winning.  Winning.  He coined a whole new fucking phrase.  Oh, I'm having a little bit of this.  And then there's the picture of him with the seats.  You got two pints of ice cream?  I'm not getting eaten that much.  Well, you never know which one he's going to be. 
[01:02:30]  Well, that's true.  Well, that's pretty smart there.  I'm a fickle.  What is that?  A chili dog?  Uh, Charlie dog.  A Charlie dog?  I believe they're Charlie dog.  On a seat?  What's that?  His cock between porn tits?  Man, not just a seat.  That's a seat from Wrigley Field.  Wrigley Field, authentic seat.  You know, and you could buy one of the seats when they do some reconstruction or knock these things down.  You know, I very well could have competed with that picture.  Because I have been throwing up some pictures competing with Charlie Sheen. 
[01:03:00]  I very well could have used my WWF WrestleMania, authentic WrestleMania 2000 seat.  Uh, and, and, you know, can't put something there.  Doesn't that seat have a dent in it?  From where?  From when, you know, where, well, you were married at the time when.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  When you got that seat.  Hey, what the fuck?  Hey, they're ripping you off.  Everyone's doing it.  Everyone's doing their, uh. 
[01:03:30]  It's Jameson and Nestle cookie dough.  And that's, wait a minute.  Is it, oh, Seth Green.  Yeah, that's our friend.  Seth Green is standing at, I guess, his kitchen island in front of his stove.  You did one of these, too, with your girl.  I did it within minutes.  Well, now everyone's doing it.  Now everybody's doing it.  It's the thing to do.  It was a race against the clock, I think, with you guys.  It really was, yeah.  What was his tweet again?  Charlie's original tweet?  Pick, choose your vice or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, yeah.  Choose your vice. 
[01:04:00]  So now everyone's choosing their vices and showing the people.  And then I had my TV from downstairs, the karaoke TV, with my big logo on it.  The Anthony Cumia Guinness logo.  Oh, okay.  And then I was so insane.  Get the mask.  So insane.  Oh, get the mask.  Get the mask.  Let's do this properly.  Wow, you just put two spoonfuls in your mouth.  I don't want people to think of Riverbuff Jackass.  I really didn't know this.  No, it's not.  Believe me, that was less.  Oh, jeez, Danny is right there.  All right, hold it.  Just hold it right there. 
[01:04:30]  Breathe deep.  We're waiting, we're waiting.  Breathe deep, Danny.  Oh, no.  Did he get it?  He got it.  He got it.  What's it like?  He's screaming.  He's screaming in the mask.  Do you have a rod?  Oh, shit.  I have a pretty okay Jimmy tolerance, but it kind of smelled like a Korean supermarket.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It smells like old fish, like cheap sushi or something. 
[01:05:00]  Wow, like it's called bad?  Yeah, that's all.  Like rotting produce.  Get some rolls to go, bring it to your house, eat half of it, and then leave your house for  the weekend and come back.  And that's what it smells like.  Wow.  Yay ice cream.  He's a little boy eating his ice cream.  It's so much more, like it doesn't have a chance to mix with the air and stuff.  It's just fucking straight.  That's a hell of a shot.  Someone else has to try that.  I took two of them already. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Someone else.  Is it brutal?  Dude, it kind of sucks.  That was an okay one because there wasn't a lot of, I guess there wasn't a lot of, I  don't know how you measure gas.  What do you measure gas?  Like milliliters or something?  There wasn't a lot of it there.  Inches to the erection.  PPM.  But if there was a lot of gas there, that would have been tremendously worse.  What we need, though, is an emergency plan.  Like when Jimmy says it, we need someone on Ready 5 now.  Someone's got to be available to back up.  Well, who's next?  We've got to leave Iraq.  We've got to leave Iraq alone for a little while. 
[01:06:00]  Sam absolutely takes one today.  Iraq's laughing that he's untouchable today.  He sort of is.  I hate to admit it.  He's one of the untouchables today.  I'll tell you, one of the worst parts, it's almost not the fart itself, it's the waiting  for it to get to you.  Oh, the anticipation that it's creeping through the hose like that Pepe Le Pew fucking cloud.  You almost can't just let it sit there.  You have to almost siphon it to you.  Breathe it in.  Like you're getting gas out of a car.  Breathe deep, the gathering gloom.  Because the first few inhales, there's nothing there, and you're like, oh man, this is going 
[01:06:30]  to be where it is.  Yeah, which breath is it?  Oh, God damn.  It's like the gas chamber.  You should get Sam.  Oh, get Sam.  Get Sam immediately.  Get him now.  Get him now.  Jimmy, what the hell?  All right, here he comes.  He's running.  Jimmy is eating ice cream, and now it's just going through him like crazy.  All right, run, Sam, run.  No, I'm okay.  It might be a false alarm.  It might be a false alarm?  Yeah.  Sam, do you know what this is all about?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Listen, you kind of have to start with your mouth there. 
[01:07:00]  It's easier to put it on.  You could throw it on real quick.  Like over your head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it going to work?  You got it?  Okay, hold on.  Jimmy's going.  All right.  Okay, hold it there.  You heard the fart.  Hold it there now.  Breathe deep.  It's not working.  No, breathe deep.  Keep going.  Through your nose.  Through your nose.  Sam's not doing this exactly.  I know.  I feel this breath on my asshole.  Yeah, because he's sniffing and then he's exhaling. 
[01:07:30]  Yes, he's pushing the fart back.  So, yeah, what you kind of have to do is kind of sniff and then kind of just get it out so  that you can breathe.  And also, I mean.  You ruined that one.  Yeah.  After I'm done doing mine, I don't want to throw anybody under the bus, but Troy's shy.  He really wants to try it.  Troy.  Does he?  Really?  He wants to.  He's shy about it, though.  Yeah.  Well, we got to make sure he gets one of those.  Okay, good.  Troy definitely needs to put on the mask.  Yeah, you did it wrong.  Can I go back to the office or do I need to stay and ready? 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy's eating ice cream.  Give him a few minutes.  Okay.  I'll stay here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This, like, I don't know what you'd call this, but, uh.  Hot.  A little.  Whatever.  Whatever, like, mouth.  Whatever kind of, like, gassy, masky apparatus that this is.  It's definitely an anesthesia mask.  Yeah, it's only got, like, a one-way.  Like, there's no.  Or maybe there is a little vent.  There should be a check valve thing.  Yeah, you know what there is, but it's not very good.  Yeah, there it is.  What's a check valve, Ant?  Well, where you could breathe in and the air would flow into the mask, but when you breathe 
[01:08:30]  out, it comes out of the mask itself and not back through the hose.  So it, it's, it, like, uh, has a relief valve on it.  You want to take one?  Oh, yeah.  Missing California girl.  Wanted to send to Afghanistan or something, or Pakistan.  And a stepfather allegedly set up a marriage in Pakistan and sending a white little girl  over there.  Holy shit.  What an asshole.  Jesus.  Maybe her room was dirty.  You want to straighten her out?  Oh, right. 
[01:09:00]  I can't eat much more of this.  It's too fatty.  Really?  Is it good?  You got enough in you.  It's really good, right?  The farts are going to come now.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  The ice cream.  Everything good is so fucking bad for me.  They hate when we talk about stuff like this.  Like chick stuff.  Yeah, they don't like when we talk like chicks.  It really bothers the people.  It sucks.  It's not as much as I would have thought.  Half a cup is, uh, there's 3.5 servings.  Counting calories.  Counting calories.  That's what we do here on the Opie and Anthony show.  A little over 1,000 calories for the whole thing.  1,000 calories for the whole thing.  Yeah.  But you wouldn't eat the whole thing. 
[01:09:30]  No, no, no.  Malin Ackerman is coming in later today.  Can we have her sniff one?  Oh, boy.  If she wants her movie plugged, yeah.  Oh, no.  It's all right now, man.  Oh, no.  Pull up a picture of her so you can see what she looks like.  Who is this?  Malin Ackerman.  M-A-L-I-N.  Yeah, she's coming in to promote something, right?  Some movie?  Yes.  Thank you.  Let's see who this is.  Yeah, we know her.  Of course.  She's very famous.  What has she been in?  I don't know who she is.  She's been in lots of movies.  She was in Heartbreak Kid.  She was in Harold and Kumar. 
[01:10:00]  She was once voted Sweden's sexiest woman.  How about a movie we liked?  Harold and Kumar was good.  Oh, wait a minute.  Heartbreak Kid was great in her scenes.  Was it?  She was in The Proposal with Sandra Bullock.  You like that one, Opie.  Right?  She wasn't in The Comeback, was she?  Yes, I believe she was.  Jesus.  Wow, she's hot.  There's a lot of...  Oh, she wrote Watchmen was her big movie.  I didn't see Watchmen.  Is that a good movie?  I can't figure it out.  Her scenes are the best thing in the whole movie.  People either love that movie or hate it. 
[01:10:30]  What movie's that?  Who else is in it?  Watchmen?  Yeah.  It's the superhero movie with...  That's the one with Dr. Manhattan's penis?  Yeah.  Dr. Manhattan's dick.  He's in it.  Dr. Manhattan's dick.  Wiener's in it.  Tell her that she's going to put on the fart mask.  The fart mask?  Yeah.  The fart mask apparatus, we'll call it.  She is...  Oh, fuck.  I love her.  Yeah.  Why?  Because she was doing it in the fucking comeback.  Yeah, I told you she was in the comeback.  You saw the comeback, right?  Yeah.  The fucking...  I love her.  Did I?  Maybe you haven't. 
[01:11:00]  No, I don't know.  She's great.  What's the comeback about?  It was a...  I'm having a birtation today.  I wish I would have known it was her.  I would have...  See, I clear my throat.  Oh, shit.  Birtation.  She's, uh...  She was one of the leads in the...  What was it?  Lisa Kudrow's show on HBO.  She's great.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, the Lisa Kudrow's show.  She's the hot one.  She's the hot one.  Oh, fuck.  And she's going to play Linda Loveless in the new...  Did I say that name wrong?  No.  Linda's...  Go ahead.  Say it again.  Linda Loveless.  Okay.  In the new what?  In what?  In her new biopic. 
[01:11:30]  Linda Loveless.  About what?  About Linda Loveless.  Loving Loveless.  You know who she is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's in Deep Throat.  What movies should she do?  Deep Throat.  Yeah.  Right.  I know who she is.  Depth Throat.  You sure do.  Roland?  You...  I'll take the fart for her.  Ignoramus.  What?  I'll take the fart for her.  Roland said he's willing to take the fart for her.  I was going to take the fart for her.  Roland's very nervous.  Roland's very scared.  Just making jokes, Roland.  Just making jokes.  I loved Heartbreak Kid.  I thought it was one of the best fucking comedies to ever come out.  Are we just going to let Loveless slide?  Lovelace? 
[01:12:00]  No, it's Loveless.  It is Loveless.  That's what I said, Loveless.  Loveless.  You really have no clue, do you?  Lovelace.  It's not a hard A.  Right.  You lived in England too long.  It fucked you all up.  It perfected my grammar.  No, it fucked you up.  My grammar.  Schedule.  What does your grammar have to do with this?  Costume.  Costume.  My pronunciation.  And now Loveless.  What time is she coming here?  9.30.  And we love her, right, Roland?  Thumbs up.  We love this one. 
[01:12:30]  She's very funny.  I've seen many interviews of her.  Wow, Roland's not fooling around today, huh?  We love her, right?  Working class hero.  She actually does really well on talk shows, this Mel and Ackerman.  Oh, yeah?  That's fine.  We'll talk to her at 9.30.  That's good.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to make wee-wees.  Yeah, we've got to get into the Michael Moore thing.  Ugh.  Ugh.  But I think people are making a little more of this than need be, but we'll get into that.  Well, then he should have explained himself better.  He should have.  He should have, because everybody's up in arms about this fat idiot. 
[01:13:00]  More gas?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ready?  Get the mask.  Now, remember, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth and lift the bottom  up so you don't push it back through the tube.  You know what we mean?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Nerds.  It's like a drum.  Put it on.  Put it on.  Put it on. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, God.  Damn.  I hate ice cream.  See, but that's why you have to put it over your head, because it's too easy to pull it  away from your face.  Oh, God.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  Was it concentrated?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so...  It's just like you said.  It's like...  It's like, you know how Kool-Aid powder, just eating the powder is much too strong?  Right.  It's not tasty at all, because you need to dilute it?  Yeah, yeah.  This is just the powder of farts. 
[01:14:00]  Jimmy doesn't fuck around, man.  He knows how to get his system going.  It's concentrated anus.  Jimmy's still eating ice cream, so we got a few more.  So when Troy comes in, we'll have to get the mask strapped on.  Yeah, but you know what?  Troy's next.  Hold on.  Yes.  Not yet.  Jimmy.  You want Troy on standby?  I want Sam to take another one, because he threw in a mask I didn't care for.  I'm going to do it for Iraq.  Do it for Iraq.  I have to take Iraq's? 
[01:14:30]  You ready?  No, I don't have to do it yet.  I'll eat my ice cream through the break.  Oh, no.  I'll go when he starts clearing his throat.  That's great when Malin's going to be here.  Look, I really...  Defend it in a fucking rape trial.  Again.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Is he shaking?  He's doing his little shaky thing.  Yeah, let's go.  All right.  Here he goes.  Now hold that mask there. 
[01:15:00]  I don't think it matters now.  Yeah, there you go.  Ready?  Here we go.  Shh.  I have to get over my hole.  Shh.  I'm putting it over the hole.  Oh, drats.  I'm over the outside.  Shh.  Oh.  He keeps taking the mask off.  It just...  Oh!  It comes from the mask. 
[01:15:30]  It's like a gas chamber.  It's like the gas chamber.  It is.  It's great.  More fucking powdered Kool-Aid farts.  It's in the back of my throat.  It hates down.  Is it?  It's horrible.  It's in your sinuses.  It's permeating the cavities of your head.  Have I made up now?  Do I not have to get death threats on Twitter anymore?  Well, no.  People still will hate you.  They hate me.  They hate you.  They always will.  But you've got to keep the mask on next time.  You keep pulling it away.  I put it right back on.  You're going to have to have the straps around your head. 
[01:16:00]  You keep pulling it away.  I can't fit.  I've got a big puff of hair.  All right.  A big puff of hair.  It would look pretty silly.  What's the rest of this ice cream?  I can't take it out.  Ice cream.  Very bad.  All right.  One of a break.  We're doing nothing right now.  The Mike and Boar thing next and other stuff.  Stay.  Get in touch.  Get in touch with the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Love you guys, man.  Keep kicking ass.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Love your show.  Love you.  Sit down backwards. 
[01:16:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  It's music day on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's why you're hearing a lot of weird fucking songs today.  That was Big A, right?  Yeah, a little Big A auto-tune.  Action.  What else is going on?  iPad 2?  Yeah, a lot of things going on.  Apple.  Apple.  I just got my iPad, and I'm certainly going to be passing this on.  This is going to be a hand-me-down. 
[01:17:00]  I think that's what's going to happen.  I'm hand-me-downing this to my brother.  I think you're going to see a lot of people picking up the new one and either selling the  old one.  You're going to see a lot of them ending up on eBay or something like that, or handing  them down.  What's different about the new one?  Well.  I'll do the basics.  It's a little lighter and certainly a little thinner.  It's kind of a lot thinner, isn't it?  A lot thinner?  Yeah.  They did a little comparison.  Someone said that, and that's a good thing because when they're reading books in bed, 
[01:17:30]  it was kind of too heavy.  A little awkward.  It made it flop over.  How hard is it to hold this and read off it?  Double the, at least double the processor speed.  Nice.  Better graphics.  Nice.  Even though the graphics, I think, are great on it.  Oh, my God.  Two cameras.  One on the front, one on the back.  Are people going to be holding these up and taking pictures?  Well, I don't think it's so much for that as it is for FaceTime.  You do a little FaceTiming.  But you can hold this up as a camera, right? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You could take video off of it.  It'll have, what's that cheap editing program that comes with Apple?  iMovie.  Yeah, iMovie.  It'll have iMovie on it.  I like the iMovie.  No, iMovie's good if you just take and need quick cuts and transitions and stuff like that.  But it just, and it's new.  It's new, and it's Apple.  So you have to get it.  You have to.  When does it come out?  The 11th, I think?  Next week.  Next week.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  They usually make these announcements like three months out. 
[01:18:30]  But, dah.  Yeah, it's still an Apple, and it still sucks.  Really?  Is that true?  I'm not going to sit there and be an Apple fanboy, as they call it.  You already are, because you like it.  Yeah, you like Apple, so you're a fanboy.  Yeah, you know why I like Apple?  Because any time I'm doing any video editing and things like that, it works.  It works.  It accepts the format.  When I try to use Adobe Premiere on a Windows thing, blow me. 
[01:19:00]  And how does it suck?  Like, everyone is copying this.  How does it suck?  Everyone's copying the fucking iPhone, the iPad.  They're going to be, every company's coming out with their version of the tablet.  You saw that Motorola Zoom?  Zoom.  Dude, iPad killer.  Yeah.  iPad killer.  That's a killer right there.  Also, BlackBerry's got one.  Oh, yeah.  I love how awful BlackBerry is.  They're just fucking awful.  Oh, horrible.  That's going to take over the world.  What's the name of that thing?  Yeah.  Dude, my what?  The what?  Exactly.  Yeah.  The what?  I'm having a tough time holding on to this BlackBerry. 
[01:19:30]  I'm not going to lie to you.  Oh, God.  Look at the screen on it.  What are you doing?  I'm not going to lie to you.  I go to my cell guy weekly at this point.  I'm like, you're going to lose me, because he's not really an Apple guy.  He could get me one.  He could get me an iPhone if I ask.  You have AT&T.  That's why I don't understand why I have a BlackBerry.  I'm shaking.  I'm trying to hold on.  Why?  It sucks.  Well, I thought they would have a better phone by now.  Eh.  Never.  I don't know.  I was in the game for a while, but it's so obvious this thing is archaic.  It is.  It's terrible.  That thing is ancient.  And supposedly, we're supposed to have a new phone out by Christmas. 
[01:20:00]  The guy told me now we're up to March, and it's still not out, which means there  were problems.  BlackBerry, dude, they had a shot at doing it with the Storm.  They're losing.  They fucked up.  Their new technology absolutely stinks.  Yeah.  It absolutely stinks.  I tried to stick with them, dude.  I tried with the Storm.  I know.  I'm just about done.  I'm just about done.  What other phone could I get if I have AT&T?  There's a bunch.  You can get it.  I want to try a Droid.  Yeah, you could if you want that.  And there's some really good Droid phones that are out right now. 
[01:20:30]  You could have a right.  If you don't want to stay with AT&T, they're the worst.  I like my AT&T.  Oh, come on, dude.  You can't get a house phone.  Except for the fact that I need a house phone.  They're terrible.  I'm just a weirdo.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Why don't you just get an iPhone?  I could get Verizon and get a fucking iPhone.  I would be in much better shape.  Yeah.  But anyway, I love my iPad, and I love my Mac Pro.  The iPad's great.  The Mac Pro.  I bought the goddamn MacBook Pro like a month and a half ago.  All the bells and whistles I had. 
[01:21:00]  And I just went, shove as much fucking RAM into this as possible.  Eight gigs of RAM and shit.  And then they come out with the fucking, the new one.  There's a new MacBook Pro?  Yeah, new MacBook Pro.  And it's got like a real high-speed interface on it.  The Thunderbolt.  A Thunderbolt interface.  And it's so much faster than fucking...  I got that.  Oh, you got that already?  Yeah.  Chip's got it.  My old computer's got it.  So now I'm going to have to get it.  And then I'm going to have to, like, get rid of my fucking month-old computer, load all 
[01:21:30]  my software on, just for an interface, because I have to.  And the iPad isn't just thinner and has two cameras.  And the shit you can do with it...  Like, you know, interfacing with your television, through the Apple TV, and shit, it's just so  fucking cool.  These iPads are taking over the world.  Let me ask you something about your laptop or your MacBook Pro.  So when you went, did you ask them if something else is coming out?  I always do that.  I never do.  Because that used to drive me nuts when you buy the latest thing, what you think is the 
[01:22:00]  latest thing, and they have one that's being shipped two weeks from you.  Dude, they won't tell you at Apple anyway, though.  They won't tell you at Apple.  They never talk about the new technology before it comes out.  I got a guy.  He'll tell you.  Oh, yeah.  If you know someone.  I got a guy.  He'll tell you.  My friend Steve J.  I don't want to say his whole name.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where, you know...  Jobs.  Because it drives you crazy, right?  But, you know, it's also like, all right, when is it coming out?  Yep.  And shit.  Is it going to be six months?  Is it going to be fucking one week?  I want to upgrade my HD flip in the new one. 
[01:22:30]  There's rumors it's going to be Wi-Fi.  Oh, see, that's the shit.  With a little editing.  A little editing, and then you just upload shit right from the...  I just made a dumb video of the fart mask.  Yeah.  I could already be editing and uploading it.  I can't wait for that technology.  And supposedly a lot of companies are coming out with little cameras that are hooked right  to Wi-Fi.  Take out the middleman.  But I don't know when that's coming out.  It's going to probably be a while.  Oh, my God.  And Steve Jobs was presenting.  How did he look? 
[01:23:00]  With a new iPhone.  I've seen the pictures, and the picture that Danny tweeted yesterday, which was fucking  hilarious.  It's Steve Jobs standing in front of that giant screen where he does his presentation in San  Francisco, and it just said, 33% thinner.  Yeah.  Yeah, 33% thinner.  And it's him standing there.  It's an awful picture.  People are probably going to mix it up, meaning he's thinner, though.  It's still good.  Oh, Jimmy.  Big Duties tweeted it.  Me and Ed tweeted it. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, Big Duties.  Big Duties.  That's I-E-S.  Who spells duty?  D-O-O-D-Y-S.  That's crazy.  No one.  Silly.  Dude, I'm in a quandary.  I got Pop-Tarts, but they're not fucking brown sugar cinnamon.  What do I do?  What are they?  Eat them anyway.  They're Pop-Tarts.  No, I'm going to guess something.  I thought they smelled generic.  They do.  Kenny, no brown sugar!  It wasn't that wonderful-  I'm sorry.  It wasn't that wonderfulness of the brown sugar cinnamon coming in.  Oh, here comes Kenny.  Pop-Tart update in three, two, one.  Here's the problem. 
[01:24:00]  I thought I'd switch it up with blueberry just to trick you because I don't have the unfrosted  brown sugar cinnamon because I believe they might have been discontinued by Pop-Tarts  because I can only find now low-fat brown sugar with frosting.  I tuned out two minutes ago.  Could you say all of that again? 
[01:24:30]  I'll try the blueberries.  Okay.  Yeah, you can't have the frosted ones.  I'm not a fan of the frosted ones.  You know what I'm saying?  Uh-oh, Ken.  Jimmy?  Toaster pastries.  Toaster pastries?  Are they better than Pop-Tarts?  No, they're cakey.  They're a little more cakey.  Pop-Tarts tend to be flaky.  So we got the iPad 2 coming out next Friday.  I might have to get that.  I'll sell mine because mine's in perfect condition.  That's why you're going to see a lot of these flooding the market.  I'm going to give mine and my brother will be happy. 
[01:25:00]  Do you think people will buy these used?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  How do I sell something used?  I don't know how to do it.  Is that it broke?  I don't know.  I don't know how to sell something.  Put it on eBay?  Just put it on eBay.  I only want $1,500 for it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  How much can I get for a used perfect condition iPad with maybe a little jizz on it?  Which version is it?  The latest one.  Like the super good one with the 3G on Wi-Fi?  Of course.  Yeah, I hate just Wi-Fi.  Well, that's in the store, like $8, what, $799?  Yeah.  All right, so I'll get a fucking $11.99. 
[01:25:30]  How much pay for it?  If you use, I mean, in good shape.  In really good shape.  I'm sure you can get it.  You want to pawn it or sell it?  At least.  You can probably get at least $5.  I'll check prices right now.  But where do I sell it?  I don't know what to do.  On eBay.  Just give it to me and I'll sell it.  I'm frightened.  Oh, you're frightened?  I don't want to sell it.  I get confused.  I'll just be outside going, buy this.  And somebody will hit me with something and take it.  The immigrants will buy it.  Oh, yeah.  Some of them will buy it.  Do you have to declare if you sell it or it's no one's beeswax?  Because your name is still attached to it.  No one's beeswax. 
[01:26:00]  What?  How do you get rid of it if your name is still attached to it?  Oh, yeah.  You wipe it out.  You wipe it.  You can wipe.  You wipe it clean.  Wipe that.  Factory default.  But your serial number is still attached to your name, right?  Yeah, so if they do some bad shit with your iPad, that's...  Because whenever you go overseas, you have to register an iPad when you buy it.  This way you couldn't go to other countries and just sell a bunch of them.  So I'm worried that the serial number would be tied in with my name and my real info.  Yeah, but you're allowed to sell your product.  It's not like Apple expects you to keep it for the rest of your life.  No, no, no, no.  But how do you disconnect it from your name? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, how does Apple know...  I get it.  How does Apple know Jimmy sold his iPad?  And doesn't own it anymore.  So all of a sudden it turns up doing some other shit, whatever the motherfucker iPad does.  Why do they have to know?  It's like selling a car with a fucking phone number.  I agree, dude.  I sold my old iPhone.  I just...  I wiped it clean.  There was nothing on there.  And I sold it.  All right.  That's it.  You tell yourself that and we'll see.  What if Jimmy sells his iPad?  Yeah, guy buys it.  Next thing you know, he's a creep.  Kitty porn galore.  They arrest him and there's the iPad. 
[01:27:00]  He shows his eBay sale from six months ago.  He says, I sold this thing six months ago.  No, what is the porn?  The kitty porn was on it when I sold it to him.  It's a point we're all making.  Well, I didn't want to play it the right way.  And by that time, he'd already have been fucked in the ass in jail.  Just trying to make it nice, fun for you.  Wow, that was way too far.  That was way too far for you.  It really was.  Thanks a lot.  Sorry.  Can I get an AT&T droid?  I don't feel like...  Of course you can.  I don't feel like switching fucking... 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  You got to.  You got to just...  It's weird.  Take the plunge.  It's not weird.  I think I don't do it just to bother you, Jimmy.  But no, no.  It's for your own sanity.  Life is so much easier when you got the fucking...  It is true.  The two places I need to make phone calls the most, right around this fucking building  and my home, I can't do it.  So, yeah, maybe it's time.  But I get attached to stuff, too.  But, dude, I can't...  Cables get...  I'm lazy.  I don't want to have to fucking figure out how to change.  You get overwhelmed by stuff, but you don't have to.  It's real simple.  They're coming tomorrow, right?  I have problems switching things, too, because I get overwhelmed by... 
[01:28:00]  But I shouldn't.  And they're putting in files tomorrow, and I can't...  Fucking...  Really?  You're going to love it, Jimmy.  The minute it became available...  You are going to be thrilled.  I want fucking Time Warner out.  Yep.  You're going to be thrilled.  Jimmy, you got it.  Once you get it, you got to sign up, get on the list for the new boxes, the new DVRs,  because they're huge, and you could actually put additional storage onto them.  What are they getting out yet?  They just started rolling them out.  I'm getting mine in a few days.  I would like to get it tomorrow.  You could ask your installer. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, man.  Maybe I'll call today and ask for the new box tomorrow.  You're going to love it.  The guide is so smooth, and it's so intuitive.  You don't like the cable guide is no good?  What packages do you have?  The NFL?  Baseball?  Can you buy a bunch of...  I have everything!  How do I do that?  I don't know!  Am I yelling?  Yeah.  You got to get the whole fucking package.  The whole deal.  I am.  The whole deal, Wade.  Oh, the whole deal.  Hey, we got a guy that now has an anus. 
[01:29:00]  What did he have before?  I don't know.  Nothing.  A lot of shit inside of him.  He had to have something.  See, because he couldn't.  How did they get the shitties out?  Yeah.  How did his duties come out?  What's in there?  His big duties.  I don't think they were that big.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I know how they came out, by the way.  He was 55.  He was a farmer.  And they would...  He would squeeze it through a...  He had a tube coming out of his abdomen.  He would squeeze the shit out by hand through the tube. 
[01:29:30]  Like a fucking cookie dough.  No way.  Stop it.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Come on.  You're kidding.  How do you think it came out?  Through his ears?  How did he get it in the tube?  I guess it was from his abdomen.  He had a hole or something.  Like a colostomy?  Yeah.  Probably a primitive type colostomy.  He wasn't exactly...  He wasn't a big, you know...  He wasn't a big player.  I think the guy lived in China or some shit.  Let me read this.  A happy ending to Farmer's Anus Woes.  A farmer from...  Yeah, yeah, county. 
[01:30:00]  Of...  Yeah, yeah, province.  Has lived 55 years without an anus.  After being born with congenital anal atresia?  Oh, God.  Get Dr. Steve on the phone.  That's...  When they're...  The anus, there's nowhere for fecal matter to be passed.  So, ah...  We build a tube.  And you squeeze it.  Ah, not on, like, toothpaste.  Although you don't brush your teeth with it because it's fecal matter. 
[01:30:30]  And it clings to your intestines and you'll...  Toothbrush.  Squeeze it out.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I built a few of those in college.  Oh.  Doing bong hits.  Oh, you should...  And you have to be careful, though, because if you do somersaults, you're going to get  seepage all over your white shirt, and that's, you know, you don't really want to avoid that.  Yes.  I used to...  I had a friend that had that, and I had him squeeze that over a bottle, and I'd urinate 
[01:31:00]  into it and shake it up and put a label on it.  It's shitty wine.  Yes.  Oh, let me have some Asian stomach bile wine.  Thanks, Dr. S.  Got it right here.  Yeah, of course you do.  In the Wuhan Union Hospital, doctors have reshaped a new fundament.  What?  Fundament?  They call it a fundament for him in January.  Is that, instead of ketchup or mustard, a little joke on your table? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I'm sad.  I think I need a fundament.  And you open a little joke, and you put it on your sandwich, and you gobble it up.  Let's get this asshole.  Let's get this asshole on the show.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  I'm helping my kid off at school.  Oh, is that what you call it these days?  Oh.  Thanks for the mask.  That thing is great. 
[01:32:00]  Well, I had originally made that for most dangerous snatch.  Yeah, you know how we just can't wait to use things.  So it's become a great fart mask.  Excellent.  Jimmy's been farting into it, and people have been smelling it.  It's been fantastic.  Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.  Right.  I want to read more of this story, because Jimmy's correct.  Wu previously endured a 0.5-centimeter diameter surgical hole, or stomas, near his urethra, 
[01:32:30]  for excrement, through which he could squeeze stools out with his hands.  Wait, wait.  Near his urethra?  Wu had to pay attention to the foodie aid, avoid constipation, and was a frequent user  of laxatives.  He had to squeeze the shit out of a hole in him?  Yes.  And someone married this monster.  Exactly.  He was married and had children.  Oh.  As his economic situation improved, you...  Oh, she didn't suck his dick a lot.  Her nose was right by the shit tube.  You imagine that?  You're sucking the guy's dick, and the fucking shit tube drips over, and you're all drunk, 
[01:33:00]  and you start sucking that.  Like a gerbil.  Yeah.  Getting water.  And you're like, hey, your cum tastes like shit.  And he goes, oh, you're sucking a wrong tube.  Oh, my God.  So the guy had a wife and children.  Yeah.  As he made more money, Wu went to the Wuhan hospital at the end of last year, where Dr.  Lee examined him and framed operation plans.  Wu accepted an artificial anus, and three days later could excrete like normal people. 
[01:33:30]  They just sewed in a piece of kalima.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, what do you do?  What do you do?  Just put his finger through it, like the thing on the top of an aspirin bottle, and it broke  through his skin.  It's like, your asshole's been there the whole time, silly.  Dummy.  Yeah, you had to pull a cotton ball out of his fucking rectum.  Dr. Steve, have you ever heard of this condition?  Did you hear this story?  Congenital anal atresia, yes. 
[01:34:00]  It's just where you're born without an asshole, basically.  Aw.  Aw.  And, uh...  Without surgery, it's generally a, you know, rapidly fatal condition.  Oh.  Yeah, you would back up pretty quickly.  Yes, absolutely.  Now, how is the incision made near the urethra?  That doesn't make sense. 
[01:34:30]  No, it doesn't make sense.  I don't know what they're talking about.  Sometimes you can have the stoma above the pelvic bone, so it's probably above the bladder  is what they meant to say, rather than the urethra.  Oh, no.  Who's above bladder here?  Scott.  Oh, right.  Okay.  What?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  It's a management joke.  Uh, wait...  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, yeah, you're always thinking in medical terms, aren't you? 
[01:35:00]  Hey, doctor, doctor.  Uh, so, uh...  Bladder joke.  If somebody...  Now, how would they make a rectum for somebody?  What would they make that out of, and how would it function?  Rectum almost killed us.  Boo!  Boo!  Be more funny.  This is going great.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next? 
[01:35:30]  Our anus.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  I, nigh.  Okay.  Made it funny.  Oh, God.  No, that was pretty goddamn funny there, doctor's name.  Uh, rectum.  Oh, for sure.  Uh, so, so what would it be made out of?  Like, I'm sure you'd probably cut another piece of you off, but...  Yeah.  Well, um, that's a...  It's most likely that they just went in and, and, uh, crafted a surgical, uh, hole or stoma 
[01:36:00]  um, between his buttocks and, uh, and attached the end of the, the, uh, closed-off intestine.  They actually, no, they actually used the same material they make outdoor water fountains  out of, so whenever he takes a shit, it sounds like a pebble being dropped in a metal tin.  Fling.  Yeah, that's...  Fling.  I'm just thinking of anything that's kind of like an anus.  I picture, uh, maybe a scrunchie.  They just put a scrunchie back there to hold the shit in. 
[01:36:30]  That wouldn't work.  No?  No.  That might work.  You're so in a scrunchie.  Yeah.  I don't know that they had to use anything artificial.  I, honestly, uh, uh, there, there may be some...  You're killing my heart on Steve.  Just...  So they just needed to make a hole.  Exactly.  It's like a radio show.  The part of it is that you need to be confident, too, so they would have to make the hole look  sort of a Z.  Sort of a... 
[01:37:00]  ...shaped in it so that he wouldn't just be shitting all the time.  Yeah, that, that seems to me like you need some kind of a sphincter.  Yes.  You need a sphincter.  And why didn't they, why didn't they just attach you to his buttocks?  You're an asshole.  Oh!  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba!  He's our guy.  He's our go-to medical guy.  God, I love Dr. Steve.  On, on the air, he's, uh, very informed.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Well, I'm not on this subject.  I'm not.  Sorry.  Well, you sounded.  You said, uh, stoma. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, stoma.  Oh, you, oh.  Uh, well, I guess, uh, that's all the information we're going to get out of this one, huh?  I know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, hold on.  Young Daniel has a question.  I have a question about this man with no anus.  How come they just couldn't give him, like, uh, I'm sure an ostomy bag on his hip would  have been a lot cheaper.  I don't see any reason why they couldn't have, and that's what I would have assumed that they  would have done.  So, this is, uh, they're trying something experimental so he can shit sitting down instead of, you know, 
[01:38:00]  getting out of bags.  Interesting.  He's probably, but he was in China, right?  India, I think.  India?  Yeah.  There's a fundamental human right to sit down to take a shit.  Oh, that is nice.  I think they thought of a way that they could do it.  Yeah, but, I mean, if you had an ostomy bag, you could do so much fun stuff with all  that liquidy shit in a bag.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  You know how fun it is to square dance and say, swing your partner, do-si-do, and liquid  shit goes all over the dance floor? 
[01:38:30]  Well, I can tell you a story.  A friend of mine had that, uh, procedure, and he walked around with a bag on his hip for  probably over a year.  But it went away eventually?  Eventually, yeah.  Yeah, but, uh, I mean, he was my age, so, you know, he had to live his life, you know.  During the healing, while something was healing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got fucked up pretty bad.  So, you know, he was a guy in his 20s, and, you know, he had to empty out a bag on his  hip full of shit.  And that kind of gets in the way sometimes, like, you know, when you're trying to fuck  a girl in the passenger seat of a car.  Oh, no.  It fell out? 
[01:39:00]  It opened?  Yeah, and your bag opens.  Oh, God.  All over your friend's nice car.  Oh!  And you gotta, you gotta spend the rest of your day not getting laid and cleaning up  your own liquidy shit out of a Range Rover?  Jesus.  Who is the girl fucking the guy with the shit bag in a truck?  Jesus.  How low are her standards?  Well, you know, wearing a shirt, you know, because it's on your hip, you really don't  see it.  Oh.  So you'd have to, you'd really kind of have to show somebody, hey, look what I have.  She's just carrying around Jell-O pudding for the rest.  Sheets, blankets, whatever you got.  No whites.  They won't work. 
[01:39:30]  You're gonna have to sop up all this shit.  Get it all up.  That was a fun, uh, that was a fun little toy to play with.  Uh, because you could watch food come out, like, almost full and whole.  Because it's, it's by...  You would watch it?  Yeah, like, if...  Did you ever eat a piece of feta cheese out of it?  Well, we, we had a bet going.  No one could come up with enough money.  But, uh, there was like a full, a full, never, pristine, untouched, like, inch by inch piece  of bacon that was in there.  Would you have eaten that?  Oh, God.  I can't even think about it. 
[01:40:00]  We wanted him to take it out of the bag and re-eat it.  But we just couldn't come up with enough money.  He had a dollar eighty-five.  Pretty much.  But he, he definitely would have, like, I regret not having more cash on me that day.  Yeah, he would have done it.  Because he would have done it completely.  Fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  Why did I chew it?  Yeah, yeah.  He was just swallowing it.  He was just eating it.  It was great, too, because, uh, uh, you could just watch how fast your system really goes  through stuff.  Because he would eat, uh, drink, like, a green Gatorade. 
[01:40:30]  And literally, forty seconds later, his bag is filling up with green Gatorade.  Well, his system, yeah.  Because he wasn't going through all fucking miles of tubing.  He's heading it off at the pass.  Exactly.  He was getting no nutrients.  No nourishment whatsoever.  He would always call me over to the toilet, because he had to, like, empty his bag out into  the toilet, right?  So, uh, he was really excited one day.  He's like, dude, you gotta come see this!  You gotta come see this!  I'm like, what?  He goes, it looks just...  He's like, you know when a lava lamp is just ready?  It's just ready, almost.  And I'm like, yeah, he goes, it looks just like that.  And I went in, and I looked, and he was right. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, God, that's fucking disgusting.  Like, it loosens up, but then it goes up the oil, so it's cooler up top, so it cools off  again.  Ew.  So gross.  Jesus.  Yeah, he's got tons of stories for you guys.  Oh, great.  That's fucking disgusting.  Well, that's what happens when you have a fucking shitbag on the side of your face.  You don't have a shitbag.  Shit happens.  Is he okay now?  Um, kinda.  Is his shit situation better?  No, I don't think he's had a solid shit since his accident. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, what kind of accident?  Oh, he got crushed by a garbage truck.  Oh, alright.  Severed his colon.  There was shit flowing through his body like blood for a couple of days before the hospital  realized.  What is that called, Dr. Steve?  Horrendous.  When that happens?  Septic.  Yeah, septic something or other.  Yeah, like a septic, uh, septic shock.  Which is what happens when a garbage truck severs your colon.  I think Dr. Steve hung up on it. 
[01:42:00]  Good.  No, no, I'm here.  I'm sorry.  No, that's okay.  I'm driving.  I'm driving.  Alright.  I'm driving.  Alright, we'll let him go then.  Alright, Dr. Steve.  Thank you, sir.  We have a call from an Apple tech who I know who wants to come on the air and talk about  the iPad.  He said he was on hold, but if he calls back in, Keith, call back in.  He said he'll answer iPad questions if anybody has them.  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  Dr. Steve, thank you.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Bye, DRS.  It's just a terrific story, though.  The guy's got his anus, so he can live his life now.  Yeah, it's heartwarming.  Our anus.  Our anus, right.  Keith in Pennsylvania, talking about iPads today. 
[01:42:30]  Because, you know, a bunch of us are going to get the iPad, too, and want to sell our  old ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, Jimmy, it's actually pretty easy once you do the restore on the original iPad  because it needs to be activated again.  Oh, okay.  Once it's activated again, the serial number gets applied, too, because it needs to be  plugged in, ran through iTunes.  iTunes has to do the activation, and then they have to register that.  You wouldn't have to because your version of iTunes already has your registration information  in it. 
[01:43:00]  Ah.  So I just, I factory set it, and I put it up.  It'll activate, I'm sorry, Jimmy, it'll activate automatically because your registration information  is in iTunes.  Now, if they plug it into another version of iTunes, that's that individual's information,  so then it needs to be reactivated.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Oh, okay.  After that information, okay?  That makes sense.  I was actually going to do it in Dr. Steve's voice, but what the fuck is up with every one  of his fucking words ending with an A for the dramatic effect?  Congenital, anal, whatever the fuck he said. 
[01:43:30]  I don't get it.  Did you hear him?  Neither did we.  I don't get it.  We didn't hear what you said, Keith.  Yeah, nice child.  I have to be nice to him.  He has my home number.  Hey, how's, how's, how's, how's that, uh, that, uh, Thunderbolt?  He left.  He's gone, yeah.  Hey, uh, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  I'd like to ask about the Thunderbolt.  He's an Apple tech.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yeah.  Michael Moore, Anthony.  Michael Moores.  I heard this and I said, wow, I know somebody that's going to be very upset about this.  I do think it was a little bit taken out of context because there's one thing you said  that I agree completely with.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, we're going to find out right now.  I think it was kind of taken out of context.  Yes.  Yeah, a little bit.  But I can't stand him, though.  We met him, though.  Yeah, we did.  Usually when we meet people, we end up like him.  Yeah, we met him and, uh, he came off, uh, as a hypocrite to me, as a matter of fact. 
[01:44:30]  Why?  Well, he didn't, he didn't seem as fucking, you know, for the common good and the common  man as he does when he's preaching.  I see.  He came off like a guy that, uh, just wants to pump, pump out some movies and make some  fucking money.  Make some money?  Yeah, yeah.  Walk around Flint, Michigan.  He's like a Rush Limbaugh guy.  Rush Limbaugh doesn't believe it.  Absolutely wants Obama to be the president.  Yeah.  It's good for business.  Of course it is. 
[01:45:00]  It's good for business when this happens to these guys.  Michael Moore is dying for a Republican president.  Yep.  Because it's good for business.  So they can start bitching again.  I really wonder if those guys, you know, pulled the lever for, uh, the guy.  I know.  I really wonder if Rush goes, you know what, I need Obama for my business.  Although, I mean, that's, that's a bad example because he does well either way, but he does  much better when you got like an Obama or a Clinton in there.  Clinton made his, made his career.  Uh, this is what Michael Moore said very recently. 
[01:45:30]  This country is not broke.  State of Wisconsin is not broke.  There's a ton of cash in this country.  Trillions of dollars of it.  But it's a finite amount.  There is only so much cash.  All right.  What's happened is, is that we've allowed a vast majority of that cash to be concentrated  in the hands of just a few people.  And they're not circulating that cash.  If you don't believe that, go try and get a loan right now.  They're sitting on the money.  They're using it for their own stuff. 
[01:46:00]  They're putting it someplace else.  They have no interest in helping you with your life, with that money.  We've allowed them to take that.  That's not theirs.  That's a national resource.  That's ours.  That we've all have this.  We all benefit from this.  And we're, or we all suffer as a result of not having it.  And, and I think that, that we need to, uh, go back to taxing these people at proper rates.  Shut up.  Um, uh, they need, uh, to, we need to see these jobs as something that we own, that we collectively 
[01:46:30]  own as Americans.  And you just can't steal our jobs and take them someplace else.  I don't 100% disagree with him at all.  I mean, but he's going off on a few different subjects in one fucking swath.  He's absolutely right about the piece of shit banks.  They took our money to stay afloat and these motherfuckers give nothing back.  0% interest on your money and they charge you what percent?  Yeah.  They're fucking garbage.  They're fucking garbage. 
[01:47:00]  The banks in this country, they're terrible.  Uh, yeah.  Terrible.  But, and then again, a lot of fucking people were defaulting on loans and.  They were, but you know what?  And, and, but.  They're shit, dude.  I don't default on my loans.  I pay and they still give me no interest.  They were getting greedy.  They're fucking sickening.  And giving loans to people that couldn't afford to fucking pay the loan back.  And that's what got them into all this fucking trouble in the first place.  Because of the greed.  Yeah.  Because it's all, it's greed, but it's also stupidity on the part of the people.  Like, there's so many, there were so many people that were taking loans out that they 
[01:47:30]  knew they couldn't fucking pay back.  Like, and no one talks about what pieces of shit they are.  Like, oh, they're victims of this corporate machine.  These people.  No.  They're victims of their own stupidity and living way beyond their fucking means.  And that's what fucked the banks, too.  Like, it wasn't just the, uh, the executives that, that, uh, ran the banks into the ground.  Don't you think the banks were aware, though?  They were giving loans to people that couldn't pay them back?  Yeah, exactly.  Because they were being greedy.  Right. 
[01:48:00]  Because they knew they'd wind up defaulting.  They'd wind up having made whatever money they did.  Plus, they'd get the property back.  Right, right.  And, uh, you know, sell it.  But then the price of everything went to shit.  Right.  But, uh, the truth of the matter is, everybody was guilty on that one.  You can't look like these people were, uh, victims.  Victims?  Then don't buy the fucking house.  Don't buy the fucking car.  Don't try to get a loan.  And when the bank tells you no, don't scream that the bank won't give you a fucking loan.  I have, but I have more understanding of a person who wants a home and who wants to get out of an apartment. 
[01:48:30]  I have the home.  I live in a fucking hobo.  I have more respect for somebody that wants to own a home and wants to make a go at that than some fucking cunt bank.  And I'm not saying I blame banks for everybody's woes.  But there's a calculated thing that the banks were doing.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a knowledge that they have and an understanding of finance that average people, I'm sorry, we just don't fucking have.  I'm lucky I make money.  I can pay my loan off early. 
[01:49:00]  Exactly.  I fucked them out of 24 years of interest.  Wow.  I fucked them out of years.  And they had me on a fucking...  You're fucking this show out of interest.  Yeah, well, you should pay your principal.  What's the school got to do with this?  Oh, you're fucking this show.  Sorry, I love my Jimmy. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, that was a fucking damn good one.  I deserved.  Really.  But don't you fuck yourself on the other end with taxes and stuff?  That's what people say if you pay back your loan too fast.  No, because...  Like, there's another side to this.  What's the other side?  I don't get it.  Accountants, and again, this is why most fucking people in finance should just be beheaded in the public square.  I want to pay my mortgage down.  Pay it off.  They're saying, no, that doesn't make sense.  I know.  I hate when the accountants...  You've heard it, too, right?  It's garbage.  It's shit.  What's the real answer?  I don't know the exact breakdown, but let's just say you owe $100,000. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  Let's say, they say it's a write-off, which means I pay the bank $100,000, and I don't have to pay tax on that money.  Right.  But I still pay the bank $100,000, a lot of it, I think, on the interest, right?  Yeah.  Whatever the interest is, is a tax-deductible thing.  Tax deduction.  So if I don't have the write-off, I have to pay taxes on $100,000.  Yeah.  But it still means I have $100,000, and I'm paying taxes on it. 
[01:50:30]  It's like...  But here's the school of thought on this one.  The reinvest and make more points on the money?  Yeah, we saw how that fucking worked on the market.  It went down the fucking toilet.  Because you're supposed to be able to take that money that you would just pay off and make more money than you're paying an interest by putting it into the market or something.  If I were to listen to that, when the market shit the bed, I lost some money, but I fucking dumped money into principle for the last six years fucking like an animal. 
[01:51:00]  And when the market shit the bed, you know what?  All that money I put into my apartment, they couldn't fucking...  They could do nothing with it.  It was already in.  So I was investing in that.  Don't let them fucking...  If you can afford to do it, if you're lucky, I'm very lucky.  I'm a family.  I was fucking doing gigs.  If you can put money into principle, don't listen to that write-off shit.  We gotta trust you.  You like duty on your chest.  Isn't that right in my face, too?  Jesus Christ, speaking of...  And equity in his house.  Yes.  Yeah, but I don't know what to believe.  And 100% equity.  Are you gonna go with Jimmy's explanation, Ant? 
[01:51:30]  I like it.  I want to pay this fucking mortgage down.  You want to give these vultures interest?  I don't know.  I want to own outright.  I want to be able to just go...  I own outright, dude.  I'm one payment away from owning outright.  I'm a few grand away.  I'm not much away.  Damn, that's great.  But the thing is, again, let's just say if you spend 100 bucks, that's interest.  The bank charges you interest.  You're not touching the principle.  They're like, give us 100 in interest.  So you give them 100 in interest, and then the government says, well, you don't have to pay taxes  on that money because it was paid in interest. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't have to pay taxes on the 100 that I handed the bank in interest.  You gave it.  I would have had the 100.  Let's say I paid off, and I don't owe the scumbag bank anything.  Yeah.  I have 100 in my hand, and I have to pay, say, $30 in taxes.  I still have 70 in my hand instead of having given the fucking bank 100 in interest.  Was there penalties because you were paying too quickly?  No.  There are on some, but on mine there was not.  I think there might be on mine.  But, dude, it's still worth it.  There's no way the penalties are going to outweigh the fucking interest over 30.  They had me 10 years, 10 years interest only. 
[01:52:30]  I didn't have it.  Look, they did give me the loan, so I had a fucking, I had a 10% equity loan, which was  very high interest, 10% I put down, and then 80% regular loan.  Still relatively decent interest.  I paid the 10% off in the first year because I didn't want to give these fucking creeps  any more interest than I had to.  Yeah.  All right.  We got a CPA guy.  And I'm sure he's going to scream.  I'm sure I'm making some mistakes. 
[01:53:00]  CPA guy.  Yo, Jimmy, let me tell you something.  You're exactly right, my man.  Thanks.  So if you can pay down your mortgage, you should.  That's exactly right.  I don't know what CPAs out there are saying that you should hold on to it.  Motherfuckers.  The mortgage interest is a write-off on your tax return.  It can reduce your taxable income.  It's still money out of your pocket.  Sure.  So if you can avoid paying that, why wouldn't you?  And that money, it's like, there's other ways you can get other write-offs.  Like, you know, instead of paying it in interest to the fucking shit bank, can't you put it 
[01:53:30]  into your apartment and have stuff done on your apartment?  Isn't certain, like, work you put into your apartment considered a write-off as opposed  to paying it in interest?  And I know the banks have a right to charge interest.  They should.  They're giving me money.  But the amount of interest these fucking pieces of shit charge, the amount of money they ask  from fucking Americans in general, and then what they give us is fucking, they're fucking  hateable.  On a 30-year mortgage, like you said, the first 10 years are just paying interest.  And then you finally get to the principal.  I'm going to talk to my accountant and see, by paying off how much, because I would dump 
[01:54:00]  in so much money into principal every fucking month, whenever I could.  Some months I couldn't do it.  But if you can do it.  And you know who taught me that?  Vinnie Brand.  Vinnie Brand is a smart financial guy.  Not a lot.  About comedy zero, about booking a club zero, but about mortgages.  He can't even make chicken wings right.  He has a horse's ass.  Pardon?  Pardon?  But no, Vinnie was right.  Vinnie fucking, Vinnie is the one that would talk, it's called amortization. 
[01:54:30]  Amortization.  I don't know how to put it.  What if my mortgage is different?  It couldn't be that much different.  You're paying interest.  What do I ask?  A mortgage guy.  Who's my mortgage guy?  On a 30-year mortgage.  You're paying a lot of interest, brother.  Pay it off.  The first, the month that you start paying more into principal than you do interest, if  I was to start a loan this month for a 30-year mortgage, I wouldn't reach that point  until 2027.  Nice.  Well, you start paying into principal instead of just interest, or you pay more into principal.  More principal than interest. 
[01:55:00]  What if I'm not keeping my place?  Does that factor into it?  Well, again, that's the same thing.  I've been in three years, but a couple more years, I'm moving on to something else.  That's a situation for an interest only, probably.  Maybe, but again, the money goes in.  You don't pay any principal because you're not looking for equity in your home, so you're  just looking to stay there.  You don't care if you pay off your house.  So you get an interest only.  Just pay the interest.  Don't pay the principal because what's the point?  So now I don't pay it down.  You've paid in a bunch of fucking... 
[01:55:30]  What?  You've just paid rent.  Before this place, I was a loan officer.  Obviously, you know your shit.  You've paid a lot of interest.  You have to pay your bank back anyway.  So let's say you pay interest only for two years, and you pay whatever it is you pay a  month.  Let's just say you pay $1,000 a month in interest.  That's like you're paying rent.  Yeah, it's like rent.  I put a little aside every month that goes right to the principal.  That's how smart I am.  I put way more than a little.  A little bit.  Because you know what, dude?  A little bit.  I have no fucking pressure anymore. 
[01:56:00]  I'm paid.  I'm very lucky that I'm almost paid.  I need to make a living.  But I love this gig.  But I'm not afraid of the fucking gig blowing up because I'm fucking...  I got a place to live.  It's like they can't fuck me out of that now.  That's why I was crazy.  I don't trust anything anymore.  No, I don't either.  Dude, you should pay it off.  And then if you sell it...  Danny says I shouldn't.  You have to pay the bank back anyway, bro.  You have to give that money to the bank anyway.  Why?  So it's like if you're putting money into principal...  I could just skate.  They don't let you skate.  I'm just going to skate somewhere.  No, you get that when you sell it. 
[01:56:30]  What?  Then you pay the bank back when you sell it.  But you paid all that interest.  What if I just leave?  You could knock your interest payments down.  But it's like rent with the tax deduction.  Oh, the tax deduction.  Okay, okay.  All right.  What if I just move and leave it there?  There you go.  Just abandon it, right?  Just abandon it.  Like a car under the fucking Bronx Expressway.  Oh, God.  Mickey Rooney just drooled.  I just saw him drooling.  We got to get this audio.  It's really...  I'm not a big fan of Mickey Rooney.  I think he's kind of an asshole.  Who beat him up?  The people that are supposed to take care of him.  Oh, better kick me in the guts. 
[01:57:00]  His nurse...  I forget.  I forget the whole story.  But he's being treated very poorly as an old man.  Jeez.  That's a shame.  And I told this comedian not to work dirty.  And he punched me in the spleen.  That's right.  Didn't he tell you that?  Don't work dirty.  I'm going to talk to someone.  Because Danny's saying some good things.  You're saying some good things.  But the thing is...  There's no way I'm staying in my place.  Oh, then maybe that's different.  I know if I want to sell mine, I'll sell it. 
[01:57:30]  Because I believe what buyer pays the tax on it.  You don't pay any tax when you sell it.  Because you pay it when you buy it.  So I just wanted to fucking own it, dude.  I wanted that pressure off me.  I hate being in debt.  And a lot of people can't do that because they have other responsibilities.  But I just wanted that done.  I like the idea of owning outright.  Not worrying about a mortgage or anything.  And you just got to pay your taxes.  Your property taxes and shit.  I'll have to pay more in, I think, property tax or whatever if I own it. 
[01:58:00]  But again, I have no fucking fear of losing my place to live.  But you hear what you guys are saying?  No matter what, they just keep grabbing from you.  I know.  If you are able to pay off your house, then you got to worry about the taxes anyway.  You're still paying the property taxes.  And in our case, because we're in condos, my condo fees and just to park my stupid car so I could go for a ride every once in a while is ridiculous.  And then the city taxes.  It's like they just keep taking and taking and taking.  I know.  Yeah, you could own it outright and still lose it.  Like you could pay for your whole thing. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  And then still lose it because you didn't pay the taxes on it.  It's like, wait a minute, but I own this.  No, you really don't.  No.  See, that's the freedom.  They figured out a way to make sure you pay no matter what.  To keep paying.  They don't want to give you the opportunity where you could just own something and just cut yourself off and live your life with what you accumulated throughout your life.  And then live your life without still having to fork shit over.  Yeah, man! 
[01:59:00]  I know.  What a fucking pompous ass.  You know, we need to unite, man.  Well, who thought it was a good idea when people were building log cabins?  You decided, all right, that's my land.  I'm putting a fence around and I'm putting a house there.  Stake your claim.  And that was it.  Yeah.  That was it.  Yeah.  So how did it get to the point we're at today?  Very slowly.  But how if you were responsible for your own house and your own property?  I don't know.  They just decided the government had to take from you. 
[01:59:30]  But how did they make that move?  When you were living back then, it was all about, here's my house, here's my property.  That's my little place.  Like, what changed?  Does anyone know?  It had to start somewhere.  You know what I'm trying to say?  The country needed money.  So they knocked out all these log cabins and said, well, I know you own your property and  your house, but now we need a little taste.  Eminent domain, perhaps.  I don't know.  Where they decided, ah, we need this.  But, yeah, things certainly changed and were much different back then. 
[02:00:00]  Here's a loan officer with a simple explanation.  Like the Louisiana Purchase?  Does anyone really know the answer to that?  Because there was a time a lot of people just owned their house, their land, and that  was it.  Funding wars.  Is that what they're saying?  The major problem is now, and Jimmy, the advice you got was very good, but in terms of  whether you want to put money to that or other investments, the problem is that values, home  values, have just been going to shit lately. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  And the simple way to look at it in terms of whether you should put money down and where  it's going to go is, if you have a 30-year loan and you make one additional payment a  year, a 30-year loan turns into a 26-year loan.  So that's the basic philosophy of, you know, how am I going to re-amortize my loan?  But, you know, you're making that payment, and you can always be investing it rather than  having your home value continue to plummet.  So it's a double-edged sword.  I know.  I mean, luckily, living in Manhattan, there's an advantage to home rates because your apartment, 
[02:01:00]  Manhattan real estate, I think, recovers faster than most.  Like, that's one good thing about being in New York is, like, we're very lucky with  that.  Excuse me, I did a little research.  Our properties never went down, Jimmy.  I don't even know what mine's worth.  For some reason, I think it's lower than what I paid for.  I think I overpaid for mine, but whatever.  We lucked out.  I think $300 million for a one-bedroom is too much.  A lot of people said, do you know how many $35 million gigs are headed there?  62 in a row in a one-week period.  Just to break even?  Yeah.  That's hilarious. 
[02:01:30]  You guys in New York are the exception.  Most people are...  Yeah, they got killed.  Yeah, it's tough, but...  Hey, uh...  No, no, no, no.  Don't punch you out, Chris.  If I'm not going to stay in my place, should I pay down my principal?  Well, if you said it didn't lose any value, then yeah, absolutely.  If you got the money, and I think you do, oh, yeah, absolutely.  Just pay it down.  If values didn't decrease, and if anything, they went up, then yeah, when you have that  money, when you get your tax returns back, put that up, make one lump sum payment, you're 
[02:02:00]  going to re-amortize the loan and shorten the overall length.  Yeah, but what he's saying is he's not sure if he wants to stay there in the loan.  No, I know I can stay, because it's...  So why put principal into the property if you're not going to stay there?  Right.  Someone just Twittered me something, so let me ask you, if you pay interest only and the  market drops, you're in the hole.  Oh, yeah.  Interest only, it should always be like a last resort.  Interest only is the only way to go.  You're really, you know, you're basically drowning, and you need to save money. 
[02:02:30]  You know what it was?  I got this in 2005.  We were just back on the air.  I could show a decent income, but as a stand-up, it's hard to show a certain income, because  it changes from week to week, and then there's times when you don't work for three weeks.  It's hard to show, like, a steady income.  Plus all the illegal activity you're involved with.  Absolutely, because I do a lot of gigs in Mexico.  The cartels are all big fans.  They're like, you know, they do that impression, and they shoot at my feet, and I dance around.  The sombrero.  I thought there was also a gig coming up in Montclair, New Jersey, isn't it, this weekend?  Oh, wow.  Yes, the Montclair gig will be declared to the government. 
[02:03:00]  Why?  Because I'm honest.  Exactly.  I hate paying my taxes, but you know what?  You've got to pay them.  I know guys that don't pay taxes.  I'm like, you know what?  You're an idiot.  What do you think?  They're going to forget?  Yeah.  They always get you.  You actually know, guys?  I've known them over the years, and I don't comprehend.  We'll stop right there.  I don't comprehend that thinking.  But legally.  The cash business?  What do they say?  Legal?  Legally, you don't have to pay taxes?  I love when the people jump out with that.  But the government.  You know?  There's no law that says.  There's no law that says. 
[02:03:30]  There's no law that says.  Apparently there is.  Yeah, I think there is.  Let me plug my company and let me run into work.  RHMCloan.com.  Wow.  You just got some loans today, brother.  All right.  Punch it out, boy.  All right, man.  There he goes.  Loan guy.  Yeah, Vinnie Brandt helped me.  I like to pay it off.  I don't like being in debt, dude.  It really frightens me, and you are beholden to things you might not want to be.  I don't have to do gigs I don't want to do.  It's nice.  Yeah.  James in Buffalo's got the answer to the log cabin dilemma. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, okay.  James in Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, guys.  So, basically, if you just stake your claim out with your log cabin, the guy with the  log cabin next to you just comes over and just kills you because he wants your land, too.  So, then, you know, they set up laws so that people have their own property and there's  rules about it.  And then, you know, you set up and you say, all right, we want clean water here.  We don't just want to dig into a shitty well.  So, we start paying taxes.  We start getting roads and all that shit. 
[02:04:30]  And that's basically how that all starts.  And now, you know, we're fucking beholden to the government for everything.  I just said beholden that you said it, sir.  Please.  Beholden.  Please.  It's the one word that was mine today.  All right, James.  Jimmy, I just love you so much.  Oh, James, you're a sweet fella.  The government used to do that homesteading shit where they'd have people go out and they  would say, okay, you got to, in a certain amount of time, build a house.  And then, in a certain amount of time, you need to install some kind of fucking well.  And then, in a certain amount, you need to have a business or a farm set up and stuff. 
[02:05:00]  And then, you would own it for, like, nothing.  But who voted for that?  I think that was, like, the government saying, like, this is government land, but we want you  to do this to build the country up.  So, like, that's, like, the beginning of a game, you know?  It's like, all right, we need to build shit.  And then the government would be like, all right, now we're coming through.  You built yourself a nice little town, so we're going to come through with some other  amenities, and you've got to pay us money.  What if you were in a state that wasn't part of the United States yet? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, and then the United States got it?  Yes.  Like the Louisiana Purchase?  Yes.  You already had your shit down.  Then you got fucked.  How?  It's like, get off.  We own this now.  We bought.  It's like when a fucking radio station gets sold, and then the new bosses come in,  and they go, everyone out.  But it wasn't theirs to buy.  Yeah, it was, kind of.  Because no one owned it?  Yeah, the French.  Who are they?  They owned it.  From where?  They're over there.  They colonized it.  And then they're like, ah, we'll give you that. 
[02:06:00]  You can just kind of fucking, you know, help us out.  I'm going to have to take a history class.  I'm really confused.  All right, you want to take a break?  Was that it with the Michael Moore?  Yeah, yeah.  Michael Moore's an asshole.  Start with your own fucking money, then.  That's all.  He's a rich guy.  He wants to fucking, you know, tax a bunch of rich guys.  Then, you know, you chip in.  What's he saying when he said tax these people?  I got the impression he was talking about the banks.  Well, who knows?  He's talking about businesses.  He's talking about big business, I guess. 
[02:06:30]  I thought he meant the banks.  He said the wealthy at one point, and he certainly fits that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't fit his pants.  I don't necessarily agree.  He likes more on the show.  I actually like him.  He was nice.  He was a nice guy.  And Anthony agreed with everything.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you weren't too confrontational that day.  Well, I know.  Round two, you'll be better.  I was probably in a good mood that day.  I don't know.  You guys hear about the Tyson show?  Getting really good reviews. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, really?  And we should have fucking got him.  No, no.  He didn't do any radio.  The only show he did, I think, was Gayle King, because A, it's Oprah, and B, it was  on the same network tie-in somehow.  He didn't do radio.  No, it's on the...  What channel is it on?  But it's the same...  Animal Planet.  Animal Planet.  Owned by the same...  Oh, it is.  I'm thinking, yeah.  Did he rock Gayle Animal Planet?  No, but are you kidding me?  What happened?  The show is on Animal Planet?  It's a show about pigeons, yeah.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Well, and it's getting really good reviews, because six episodes, and he's been raising 
[02:07:30]  pigeons since he was 14 years old.  Yeah, yeah.  That was...  Oh, he's into those...  What are they?  Homing?  Homing pigeons.  Homing pigeons he's into...  Different than homo pigeons.  Yeah.  They fly right into your ass.  I don't know why.  It's great you really...  You really fucked that one out.  Right as I'm saying, I'm like, what am I doing?  It's great.  All 14.  He farted and cums on the pigeons.  E-Rock, am I allowed to tell him what you told me?  Uh-oh.  Sure. 
[02:08:00]  I know this started a whole thing yesterday.  What, did you read something on Mike Tyson's pad?  Jesus.  Jesus.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm just...  Oh, it was...  We're so close.  They love him.  We're trying to give him one day.  One day.  Just to show a little respect.  He rocks a good boy.  I didn't know how many fucking jokes I did not say today.  Do you realize...  I mean, listen to the replay, and kind of think about what I do here on a daily basis, which 
[02:08:30]  is nothing, and think of how many jokes I wanted to say about E-Rock today.  I didn't...  I haven't uttered a one.  How many did you have?  Roughly.  Probably a dozen.  No, I would say, honestly, yeah, probably 10 to 12.  Were there any about his life?  I would have...  I'm not even going to answer that, because I'm leaving him alone.  I'm not even going to answer it. 
[02:09:00]  It is E-Rock's day.  It's the day after his birthday.  Yes.  And the day after that...  Happy...  He had his horrible birthday here yesterday, and this is his birthday day.  What happened at the Tyson thing?  Because I was going to go to that, but I was...  He almost met Tyson, right?  I got to meet him, but he didn't do photos or anything, because he had a panic attack,  and then had to be rushed out.  Yeah, I heard he was...  Why?  Everyone was crowding him, and...  I hear he really hates crowds, and he loses his mind, and he was started... 
[02:09:30]  What did you tell me before the show?  He started yelling at his publicist, get me out of here, get me out of here?  He was taking a couple of photos, and then they started bringing everybody into this private  room, and he started shaking and looking around in every direction, and he was mumbling  to the lady that was with him.  He's like, get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here.  That's all he was saying.  He finished a couple of photos for Animal Planet people, and then security just parted  everybody, grabbed him, and ran out.  How long was he in that place for?  He did his little speech for the show.  It was about 10 minutes.  Okay, so you said hello to him? 
[02:10:00]  When they brought him to the second room, I got to say hi to him.  That was it.  Did he respond, or he didn't even pay attention?  He just kind of nodded and acknowledged that I was standing in front of him.  How did he look?  He didn't look bad.  He just did not want to be there.  Doesn't he have, because I've met him twice, once outside the cellar and once at the Porn  Awards on the expo floor.  Wow, that's awesome.  I have footage talking to him, video footage.  Did I show you that?  No.  Yeah.  That's really cool.  He's got his arm around me.  He's like, call me a pimp.  Tell him I'm a pimp.  He wants me to tell the people at the Porn Awards he's a pimp.  Whatever you want, sir. 
[02:10:30]  That's the type of stuff we should be playing on the show.  I thought you guys heard it.  I'll bring it in.  It sounds familiar.  I'm not sure if we ever played it.  There's other footage I have, which, video.  You and Ron Jeremy?  No.  Me and Mike made out with the same girl.  Oh.  Who went first, though?  Oh, right.  And it turned out.  Uh-huh.  I knew.  He didn't.  Oh, jeez.  So don't wait.  What?  It was a...  No.  Could have been.  And you knew ahead of time?  No.  Afterwards, I found out.  I was like, really? 
[02:11:00]  It was in public, though.  It was in a public place.  I didn't care.  She was fucking hot.  He has, though.  Mike Tyson.  What is going on?  I love it.  Dude, Mike Tyson has a fucking aura.  When he walks into a place, it's an odd thing how people behave...  Like, adults behave like kids.  And we've met Foreman.  A lot of boxers, I'm sure, have that.  But Mike Tyson has a very amazing fucking presence, man.  There is a fucking energy and a force that comes with this guy when he walks. 
[02:11:30]  Jesus.  When he got off the elevator and walked into the room, all the noise of people talking  just kind of silenced.  They just watched him walk across the room.  He is a fucking larger...  He's probably the most impressive guy you'll ever meet in your life as far as just being  around.  Maybe aside from a president, but charisma.  Muhammad Ali.  Even in his current state.  Absolutely.  Ali is...  Yeah.  You would lose your mind.  Ali is...  I'd probably cry if I met Ali because he's...  Ali is a much more important figure, but Tyson is just a fucking force. 
[02:12:00]  And I've met a lot of boxers at events and stuff like that.  Holmes, fucking Cooney, all these guys.  Oh, come on now.  That's crazy.  Plus, we had Frazier in.  We had Frazier in.  Frazier was amazingly...  Frazier.  Frazier was Joe Frazier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when Mike walks in, man, there is a fucking...  Frazier was pretty impressive, though.  Beyond impressive.  But I'm telling you, Tyson is a fucking force. 
[02:12:30]  He's a very impressive guy.  Well, this show looks great.  Getting good reviews.  I'm happy for him.  Six episodes on Animal Planet.  But you get to see the guy, they're saying.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not...  The man behind the men.  The man.  Yes.  You know...  The man and his pigeons.  In the past discussion that we've been having, I didn't do four jokes that I could have  done.  Yeah, but...  I just wanted to know.  That's not...  That's not like being nice.  I know.  Exactly.  Like, you should just keep it to yourself. 
[02:13:00]  No, but I can't.  Yeah.  I almost...  I came this close to blurting it out.  What?  How could I not make a joke about how excited he was to meet Tyson?  What were you going to blurt out?  That he thought it was the chicken guy.  Let's see.  Let's see.  No, you just did it.  Okay, but that was good.  I just...  But you just did it.  I'm sorry.  But you just did it.  I know.  You just did it by...  I couldn't help it.  You just did it by saying the joke you were going to say.  I had a bunch of them until I was going to start shooting up. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, Chip.  But you're being nice today.  Yeah.  I was going to say, what do you put on boxing gloves and punch ice cream into your fucking  fat stomach and tits?  Jesus.  Holy shit.  That isn't even a joke.  That's just vicious.  Holy shit.  I was holding back.  Jeez, Chip.  Holding back a whole lot. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  I didn't want to tease him, though.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Good.  Yeah.  Because when you were saying Mike Tyson was there, I was going to say, was there a whole  lot of black guys that like when they used to fuck your mother?  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Chip is a prick.  Chip doesn't know how to be good-natured.  No, that's not good-natured.  Good-natured ribbing isn't something Chip knows about. 
[02:14:30]  This is supposed to be a nice E-Rock day.  I know.  I know.  We all run into it.  I am being nice to him.  I didn't say that stuff.  I didn't say nothing about him.  Just a joke.  Yeah.  He brought a glove.  Didn't you ask him to sign your glove?  No.  I didn't have a glove.  I had something else.  What'd you have?  I had a copy of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out.  Of course he didn't.  Of course he didn't.  Oh.  And he just wouldn't sign it?  Before I even got near him, all the publicists said that he's not signing any autographs. 
[02:15:00]  Did he want a copy of Eric Nagel's Lunch-Out?  You know why?  Why?  You're just not a nice guy.  Yeah.  You're just an evil motherfucker.  You're just the worst.  Maybe you should have had him sign.  Wait, what was that game they did the documentary about?  Even Chip won't do that one.  Oh, shit.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  That's it.  All right.  We're going to break.  No more jokes.  No more jokes.  No more.  That's it.  He said Adam signed Gilbert because you're fat.  Oh, look.  They're advertising the show.  Oh, it's a commercial.  Yeah, that's different.  He doesn't have a scarf on.  Oh, my God.  That's so...  Holy mackerel.  Listen.  No teasing Iraq today. 
[02:16:00]  No, no, no.  After the break before we get...  She's not here.  Mal and Ackerman?  Mal and Ackerman's here.  Where is she?  I don't know.  She'll be here at 9.30.  Can we do your most embarrassing tape today?  I don't have it with me.  Oh, they have it.  Danny has it.  You know what?  Danny has it.  Danny has it.  Can we do that?  I'd love to hear some of that.  After the break, we might do, Jimmy, doing some TV from 1996.  Oh, nice.  But first, I got over here this. 
[02:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get.  Reality TV Heartthrobs.  The Mythbusters.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with the Mythbusters.  Mythbusters, do you take lemon in your water? 
[02:17:00]  Lime, actually.  Sure, why not?  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I hope you know, I hope you know, that this has nothing to do with you.  It's personal, myself and I.  We've got some straightening out to do.  And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket. 
[02:17:30]  But I gotta get a move on with my life.  It's time to be a big girl now.  And big girls don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  I'm going home.  Back to the place where I belong. 
[02:18:00]  And where your love has always been enough for me.  I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong.  I don't know, regret this life I choose for me.  But these places and these faces are getting old.  So I'm going home. 
[02:18:30]  Well, I'm going home.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't lie, man.  It's tough to hear his voice.  Miss that smelly motherfucker.  For the new listeners, that's Tippi Tom, our homeless friend.  Way before Golden Voice, there was Golden Buns, who died about two years ago at this point. 
[02:19:00]  Ah, fuck, that just bothers me.  How funny was that motherfucker?  Just funny and full of life.  And a raging alcoholic.  That lived on the streets.  All full of piss and vinegar without the vinegar.  My favorite Tippi Tom moment, when we wanted to do homeless, we did baby diaper mustache,  and then we decided to do homeless, how do we, I forgot the name of the thing. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, Gregorio.  Homeless duty mustache, I guess, whatever.  Oh, God.  So we had to cut his underpants off.  Oh, yeah.  Because his legs were too big and his pants and his shoes.  So we decided, well, if he could just pull his pants down, we could cut the fucking underpants  off, which we proceeded to do.  And then we plopped the underpants on this table, and it sounded like a brick, because  in his pants was a petrified duty.  It was like petrified wood.  It really was.  It was petrified. 
[02:20:00]  No joke.  Yeah, like a rock.  And we couldn't even, like, and then if you ever, if you've ever played with Indian rocks,  where you have to kind of get them moist so you can get a little color off them.  The Indian paint rock.  Yeah.  That's what we had to do with this petrified duty so we could possibly make a mustache  on the great Pat Duffy.  I just got chills, because it's, like, so disgusting.  Dude, guess what happens at 10 o'clock?  We play it.  See, that's what we're starting to do with this show.  If we reference a little bit, then we get to play the bit, and everyone goes, oh, my 
[02:20:30]  God, this bit is so fun.  Now I remember.  So fun and funny.  Right.  But that was one of my moments that just stand out in my head when I think about Tibby Tom.  When that underwear hit the table, and you just, you'll hear it on the replay.  It was so disgusting.  At 10 o'clock today.  One of my favorite Tibby Tom moments was when they were playing $20,000 Pyramid.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  When Tibby Tom just kept blurting the answer out. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, we got to bring that back, too.  Oh, God.  We're starting to do bits again.  Tomorrow's what?  Car Crash Comedy?  Car Crash Comedy tomorrow.  Car Crash Gamma.  We got that tomorrow, and then next Friday, we might be doing a show that we can't really  talk about, but we kind of could talk about.  Yeah.  Called Deadliest Snatch.  Meh.  Deadliest Snatch.  With some nice prize money.  Or should we just bail on it so we can do it properly?  We'll have to, let's decide that after the show today.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  We might be able to talk about it on Monday.  Now, if we're allowed to actually talk about the show on Monday, then maybe we could do  it on Friday, next Friday.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah, that's good.  Because if we're going to do it, we've got to do this properly.  We've got to definitely have girls that, I don't even know how to say that.  Well, we like the idea that girls' pussy stink.  I'm not doing that again.  Hopefully, we can talk about it properly on Monday, and it'll all come together.  Because I think it has potential.  I really know.  Yay.  Anthony, Mickey Rooney.  The great Mickey Rooney.  Mickey Rooney. 
[02:22:00]  My God, what a career this man has had.  Spanning decods and decods.  Did you ever like a Mickey Rooney movie?  Bill.  Bill, of course.  Bill, one of my favorites, where he played the old retarded gentleman.  It wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but we find it to be a very funny movie.  And we even got to talk to Bill.  Dennis Quaid's in it.  I was ready to say Bill Paxton.  I get those two confused.  Oh, Dennis Quaid is in that one, yeah.  Yeah, we got to talk to Dennis Quaid about that.  Yeah.  Another fine moment on this show.  We had the great Dennis Quaid on, and we refused to ask him about anything else but the movie Bill. 
[02:22:30]  He was laughing.  That no one saw.  Yeah, he was laughing quite a bit, because I think he really, I think he's done plenty of interviews.  But I don't think he came up against an interviewer that knew so much about the movie Bill as I did,  and would not ask him anything but Bill questions, and kept doing impressions of Bill.  The obsession we have for that movie Bill.  Hey, yes.  If you haven't checked it out for yourself, you might want to.  Bill.  You should rent that and about Schmidt.  Two movies that I think weren't supposed to be funny that are just hilarious. 
[02:23:00]  And not Bill on his own.  No.  Don't get that one.  That's like saying, just get Caddyshack 2 instead of Caddyshack.  Right.  It's not that.  It's Bill.  Why is this guy?  Hey, Bill.  Like, perverse pleasure in other people's downfall and troubles.  You guys put out too much of his life.  It's not your guys' business.  So, I know if it was me, I would be like, why are you guys in my life?  So.  Too much media.  Yeah.  Basically.  Too much.  Way too much.  I think he's out of control. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, I think he needs to take a look at himself.  You know, the other thing I was thinking about is this is a guy who's really been exposed  to this since he was a small child.  Remember, his father is Martin Sheehan, a major movie and television star.  So, he almost seems way too comfortable having his life unravel.  And then, as we've seen, now putting his kids right into the spotlight.  That's the latest from here, guys.  Back to you.  No, you guys are putting them in the spotlight.  Exactly. 
[02:24:00]  Whatever.  People are loving Charlie Sheehan on Twitter.  But these news people are just.  I like her, actually.  They're just outraged by the whole thing.  Yeah, now they're outraged.  And I love how the media is talking about the outrage, yet they just keep putting more  out there.  Right.  Yeah, I don't know what to make of it.  I don't know.  Whatever.  So, Mickey Rooney, yes.  Yeah.  Bill, one of my faves.  Yeah.  And, wow, Dennis Quaid looks young and Mickey Rooney already looks really old.  Yeah.  And this is early 80s.  And Mickey Rooney's still alive.  God damn.  How old is Mickey Rooney? 
[02:24:30]  173.  Damn.  That's a hell of an age.  170.  Let's never give real answers ever again on this show.  Have we ever?  Let's make it packed right now.  No real answers ever.  No more real answers.  Fuck that.  Doesn't get you anywhere.  Yeah.  So, Mickey Rooney, what?  He got abused?  I guess he got abused.  Somebody better get the mask.  Oh, shit. 
[02:25:00]  Somebody better get the mask.  It was Troy's turn.  Who's up?  Troy.  Get Troy quick.  If you guys weren't listening earlier, we got a fart mask apparatus.  Dr. Steve sent it.  We got to admit it was a jackass thing that we didn't know about.  I did not know it was a jackass.  I would never have stolen it.  All right.  So, now we do.  So, Jimmy's been eating ice cream all morning.  Troy, make sure the mask doesn't come off.  Okay.  Troy has put the mask on.  There it is.  There it is.  Hold it on there.  There you go.  Breathe in through the nose.  Wow, that was a loud fart.  Out slowly through the mouth. 
[02:25:30]  That was a loud fart.  In through the nose.  Keep it on.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  Troy, get on mic.  And?  That's rough, dude.  It's rough.  Yeah, Jim's farts are the fucking worst.  I was in a mask.  It made your hair stand up straight.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow, look at that.  His hair was like that, dude.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, that was bad, dude.  Travis is up.  I'd be honored to take it. 
[02:26:00]  Honored.  Travis, you really want one?  Well, I mean, I have no problem taking one.  I've been smelling Jim's farts for six years, so.  That is true.  Everybody's kind of immune to him at this point.  Can we get all the farting out of the way before this big star comes in?  I love her.  Big star.  I don't know why he's getting shocked.  All right, so Mickey Rooney abused.  Yes.  Who knew this was happening in his later years?  I guess he's been under some kind of care.  I guess.  And then the nurse and stuff is abusing him, so he had to go.  Beating him. 
[02:26:30]  He had to go in front of Congress to talk about it.  Yeah.  Why did he have to go in front of Congress?  I don't know.  There's a picture of.  Because that's what you do.  When something happens to you, you go down and announce it to Congress, I think.  Yeah?  And then maybe they pass some kind of bill.  Oh, a bill?  I think.  A bill.  Look at Mickey Rooney scolding.  Passed a bill, bill.  Look at Mickey Rooney.  You should retweet that picture, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Mickey Rooney scolding you.  It's topical.  He's got a finger in your face telling you not to be a dirty comic.  Oh, yeah.  Right before I beat him.  Good. 
[02:27:00]  I got it.  The whole joke.  Here's Mickey Rooney in front of Congress.  I have worked almost my entire lifetime in the business I love to entertain and please other people.  I am here today because it's so important that I share my story with others.  Because I was unable to avoid becoming a victim of elder abuse.  Elder abuse. 
[02:27:30]  It's just called life, motherfucker.  Elder abuse comes in many, many different forms.  Physical abuse, emotional abuse.  Sexual.  Oh, come on, sexual.  Sexual, please say it.  Sexual, sexual, sexual.  And financial abuse.  Oh, damn it.  Even with success.  Sexual.  Sexual.  My monetary thing called money. 
[02:28:00]  Money.  Was stolen from me.  Yet stolen.  By someone close.  That's terrific.  Many times.  That's terrific.  As with my situation, the elder abuse involves sexual, sexual, sexual.  It involves a family member.  Sexual, sexual, sexual.  You feel scared, disappointed.  Sexual, big cock.  Yes, and angry.  Finger not.  Just suck it. 
[02:28:30]  And you can't believe that it's happening to you.  You feel, you feel overwhelmed.  Yeah.  It's acting.  The strength you need to fight it.  To take a big one.  You can be in control of your life one minute, ladies and gentlemen.  And in the next minute, like that, you have absolutely, believe it or not, no control.  That's very, sometimes, doesn't happen quickly, but other times, very, very, very gradual. 
[02:29:00]  Over the course of time, my daily life became, my daily life became unbearable.  Why?  Why?  What sex?  Sex, sexual.  Because all of this seemed to come out of nowhere.  At first, it was something small.  Like what?  Yeah, details.  Stop with your vagaries.  A pinky.  Oh, a pinky, you think?  And then it turned into a big fucking, the anal destroyer. 
[02:29:30]  The rubber molded fist.  Yes.  It starts small, like I told the same guys in Doll Story 30 times.  And he struck me in my cheek with his fist, wrapped in a towel like Joe Pesci in Raging Bull.  And I could control it, but then it became something sinister.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It was completely out of my control. 
[02:30:00]  Why?  I felt trapped, scared, used.  He's acting.  I felt trapped, scared, used.  I felt trapped, scared, used.  This is boring.  What's he babbling about?  I don't know.  I actually think elder abuse should be mandatory.  It's the only way they learn.  I'm frustrated.  I came here for you to think of the literally millions of seniors. 
[02:30:30]  Is it tadpoles?  In my hair and back.  You are abused.  You're not alone.  And you have nothing, nothing, ladies and gentlemen, to be ashamed of.  Of course you do.  Oh, my God.  This is sexual.  Yeah.  Isn't it the rap for sex abuse?  It's not your fault.  You are never to blame.  Remember that?  Yes.  You are always to blame.  Yes, of course. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  I wonder who did this to me.  I know.  In person.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Damn, that's a fuck.  Wow.  Wow.  Nothing, ladies and gentlemen, to be ashamed of.  You deserve.  Yes, you deserve better.  No, you don't.  You all have the right to control your own life.  No, you don't. 
[02:31:30]  Everyone does.  You have the right to control your life and be happy.  Hold on.  Pause.  Maybe the guy beating you is enjoying his life.  Exactly.  Maybe that's what he's doing.  Maybe that's his enjoyment.  Maybe he's fucking listening to your stories long enough.  And he's had you dominate the conversation of Thanksgiving dinner long enough.  Could you add, with all due respect?  Yeah, with all due respect, sir.  Mr. Rooney.  Yes, perhaps him fucking planting his fist in your cheek was him fulfilling a year's long dream.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  Sorry.  Please.  For yourself, end the cycle of abuse and do not allow yourself to be silenced anymore.  God, I bet everybody just wants to punch him in the face.  Tell your story to anyone, someone.  They'll hit you.  And let them know.  The elder abuse happened to me. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  We got it.  That's why I'm here to tell you a little about it.  You haven't told us anything about it.  He's just details on something.  And if it can happen to me, oh, God willing and unwilling, it can happen to anyone.  You're five feet tall.  Who's this guy thinking he is?  Jack Johnson?  You fucking twerp.  If it could happen to him because he's the tough guy.  If it could happen to you, if it could happen to me, it could happen to any fetus. 
[02:33:00]  You said Jack Johnson.  That rules.  What the fuck does he think he is?  He's five foot and 95 years old.  Of course it could happen to you.  He was beatable back in 1940.  When weren't you beatable?  You're in the front of the line of people that are easy to pick on.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Yeah, Judy Garland used to beat him.  Oh, God.  That was abuse.  Him having to go down on a big, hairy, drunk budge.  Yeah.  Eliza's nose popped out and sang at him.  And she burped. 
[02:33:30]  And she fucking burped into the lines from Arthur.  Her fucking plastic coat on.  Dumb plastic coat.  Yeah.  She popped out and said, hi, I'm Linda Marola.  And he went.  Licked her face like a dog.  It can happen to anyone.  Right.  We got it.  I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse.  Should have said that to the guy sucking in the jaw. 
[02:34:00]  Stop it.  She's yelling.  And end it and say it's a crime.  It is.  And we will not allow it.  It is a crime.  Exactly.  In the United States.  Shouldn't be.  Of America.  Be more funny.  Be more funny.  Just thought we needed to pump that up.  Sorry.  You will be molested.  Oh, fuck him. 
[02:34:30]  Stop talking and start sucking.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I love that one.  Stop talking and start sucking.  You look like a fucking bitch, aren't he?  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault. 
[02:35:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Mel.  What is Mel saying to Mickey Rooney?  That's terrible.  That's really bad, man.  Oh, Mickey.  That's not nice.  That's terrible.  No wonder he's crying.  Oh, good God.  That's great.  That's not nice.  Is there any more Mickey Rooney, please?  Well, um.  Hmm.  I roll over and shut up. 
[02:35:30]  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll rip your ass so hard you won't sit down for it.  Wait.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I love that guy.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  I love that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, poor Mickey.  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, please squeeze my tits.  They're on fire.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  That's it for Mickey Rooney.  That's it for Mickey.  He ended it with, the United States of America.  He was acting during that whole fucking thing.  Somebody should have thrown a flag over his head and blackened his eye. 
[02:36:30]  And with bars of soap wrapped in a flag.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Do we know what happened to him?  No.  He didn't explain nothing.  He didn't say shit.  I'm fucking mad now.  I got sick of, I had to sit down and there was tapioca pudding in my underpants.  You put it there, dummy.  He thinks somebody filled his pants up.  No, the orderly did.  Shitting in his pants.  No, tapioca's white.  His caregiver was fucking his backside. 
[02:37:00]  Giving him some good care.  You can only hope that's what it was.  Something really heinous.  He should have explained it better because, like, now we can just assume it's, uh...  Do you think the guy would put his hands on Mickey's back?  Oh, God.  Just push.  And straddle his awful heinie.  Ah!  What did he do?  And what did Mickey do while he was being just...  His little feet kicked.  His feet kicked.  Like he was dancing guys and dolls again.  Get off of me!  What did he do?  I know.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, we all want details. 
[02:37:30]  What happened?  Because now you're just allowing people to assume there was some heinie sex or something.  Yeah.  No one's assuming that but us.  Oh, you think?  You think everyone else is handling this properly?  Yes.  You think we're rooting for heinie sex?  You think we're the only ones?  I know we're rooting for it.  No one else is rooting for it.  You don't think Anderson Cooper's going to take this angle?  No, he roots for that for himself.  I made that way too easy for you.  I've got to make it a little harder for you.  Why don't we take a quick break so we can clear the field for... 
[02:38:00]  How do you say her name?  Malin Ackerman.  Malin Ackerman.  Really good actress.  And I didn't recognize the name we saw on the prep sheet.  It's like I'm so happy.  I love her.  Right.  And Bobo's here to film his...  Oh, God.  His...  What are we calling it?  Suicide.  His suicide.  Actually, it's an off-radio thing.  Don't worry, guys.  If you want to check out the video later, you can.  If not, that's fine too.  But we've got her coming in next.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:38:30]  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Really quickly, I got the answer on Twitter for the people that do care.  Mickey Rooney.  They said his stepson kept him in like a...  Kept him like a prisoner in his home and stole $500,000 from him.  Cash?  That's it?  I guess, yeah.  The stepson.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  You are so hot.  Hi.  Molly, nice to meet you.  My brother-in-law is in love with you.  He just texted me.  Good.  Good. 
[02:39:00]  Is that your water?  It is.  Okay, good.  I wasn't sure if I drank out of it.  No.  If you want.  No, that would be bad for you.  Good for me, bad for you.  I want to give you a clean one.  Well, you don't know where I've been last night, so...  Ah, see?  Maitland Ackerman.  Holy crap.  I'm so happy you're here.  I didn't recognize the name when we saw it on the prep sheet, and then I realized,  oh, my God, one of my favorite shows ever, The Comeback.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, that was a great show.  Really underrated show.  A lot of fun.  Did you guys...  I mean, the whole show arced in the one season.  Were you hoping for season two, or did you know that that was kind of a 12? 
[02:39:30]  You did.  I really was hoping for season two.  What a terrible move.  Never happened.  Why didn't they do season two?  Terrible move not to.  I'm only a couple episodes in.  I just got hooked recently, and I love it myself.  Oh, good.  It's great.  But what?  It didn't do ratings or something?  No, it didn't do well for some...  I think it was a little painful to watch.  It was so uncomfortable to watch.  And I remember I forced all of my friends to come over and watch the first couple episodes,  and I remember everyone was so quiet after the first episode.  People were just going like, oh...  Why is nobody saying, like, oh, that's great, or, you know... 
[02:40:00]  And I kind of got it.  People were...  They were just uncomfortable with it, which was, you know...  But that's some of the best stuff.  It was amazing.  Maybe not for the mainstream.  I never thought anybody could be close to Gervais as far as uncomfortable and making an ass  out of themselves.  Kudrow in that was...  It was masterful.  But you...  The thing was...  The thing with you that was so great was the beautiful girl wasn't the villain.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, usually that's the easy target.  But you were actually really nice.  And, like, you should have been a bitch in the show, but you turned out to be nice,  which was a huge surprise.  And she's a bitch in real life.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:40:30]  It's like, that's how they typically would have done it.  They would have made the hot girl a bitch.  And she looked great in a bikini.  Let's be honest with each other.  I didn't even look...  Lisa Kudrow?  You didn't look?  Lisa Kudrow was just, like, so painful to watch in that.  She was so delusional with everything, and...  She played it really well.  Yeah.  And a self-centered ass.  What was the name of the show?  Oh, I'm It.  I'm It.  I'm It.  You really are it.  Ballerine Cherish.  My favorite, my favorite...  It was so bad.  So bad.  Do you remember when her teenage daughter, Francesca, I think her name was, was like, 
[02:41:00]  hey, could you drive me to school?  And she's like, wow, ch-ch-ch-changes.  Oh, my God, you really are it.  I had to hide into the Afghan.  It was humiliating.  It was just...  Creech-inducing.  It was such an underrated show.  It drives me nuts that that show didn't even get...  I'm so glad.  Well, it came back on IFC, so now people can watch it.  So Lisa's, you know, rerunning.  Maybe it was too real.  And maybe they just didn't want to see Lisa Kudrow that way, knowing that she was so famous  with friends. 
[02:41:30]  A lot of people came up to me, and they're like, oh, it's so sad what happened to Lisa  Kudrow.  I was like, what do you mean, what happened?  And they're like, no, but just like her life and how it went down.  I was like, that's a character, guys.  Yeah, that's...  This is Valerie Cherish, not Lisa Kudrow.  It wasn't a documentary, you dummy.  But I think a lot of people thought it was.  Yeah.  And so that also added to the uncomfortable factor.  The depression of watching.  But I just knew when I talked to my mom, I was like, so what did you think?  And she's like, well, you know, you looked cute.  I was like, oh, God.  You were in a big show.  She speaks for the mainstream, you know. 
[02:42:00]  I was like, all right.  So people really aren't getting it.  But you were really great.  And when she came out and did the robot, it was, oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, don't do the robot.  That stinks.  The robot stinks.  Yeah.  It captured uncomfortable absolutely perfectly.  And the writers were hateable.  I mean, the one guy was likable, and then Pauly was absolutely hateable.  I'm going to have to run through that series again.  And they're the nicest guys ever.  I know.  So cool.  But it was brilliantly written and brilliantly acted.  To me, your character on it was Juno, was the biggest surprise, because you were the 
[02:42:30]  one that typically would have made the villain, and they didn't.  Yeah.  It was smart writing.  I want our own Sam to ask about a role that you recently landed, playing who, Sam?  You can talk at all.  Who is that?  Which one?  That's Sam.  Sam, yes.  That's Sam.  Nice to meet you.  We're not sure if he's black, just so you know.  Oh, okay.  I'll try to help you out.  He looks pretty white to me, but.  Yeah, he does.  Do you see the black features, though?  There's nothing wrong with it.  And the hair.  Nothing wrong with it, but no, no. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, the hair.  I mean, it's got great hair.  Great hair.  Thank you very much.  Very big eyebrows, though.  Great hair.  No one's ever said that about him before, you know.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, what do you got there?  Well, they just want to, I don't know why you wanted me to say that Linda, you're playing  Linda Loveless in.  Yeah, Linda Lovelace.  You could say Linda Loveless.  I mean.  Yeah, there was not a lot of love in there.  Yeah.  Linda Loveless, but it's Loveless.  No, he insists that's how it's pronounced.  He really, yeah.  I don't know where the hard A would come from.  What do you put on your feet?  Shoelesses?  You idiot.  Yes, Lovelace or Loveless, the way you, whatever you want to call it. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, that's what I do.  It's Lace.  It's Lace.  I mean, there's no real question here.  They just wanted me to humiliate myself in front of you.  Of course.  Congratulations.  I mean, you did a great job.  Thank you for saying that.  Yeah, you're very welcome.  And they're saying this movie's going to make her a huge star.  A huge star.  You're already a star.  That would be amazing.  That's the buzz out there.  Oh, good.  This is the one that's going to make her just a massive, huge star.  I would love to meet those people who are saying that. 
[02:44:00]  Are you going to have to do some saucy scenes in this movie?  What, you mean like make some sauce like in a Italian movie?  Exactly.  She had to eat at some point.  She probably had sauce.  She probably had sauce on her pasta.  Yes.  I'm sure she ate what Harry Reams wouldn't sit here.  You know, it's actually a really kind of dark story.  It's, you know, it's not porn, guys.  Right, right.  You can watch the movie, Deep Throat.  You'll see a lot of it.  But this is actually my... 
[02:44:30]  Who's playing Harry Reams, do you know?  Don't know yet.  Don't know yet.  I'm really curious.  You want to audition, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You want to come in and audition for us?  I've never wanted to look like Harry Reams so bad in my life.  I hear he's like a complete, you know, 180s living in Utah now and is...  Oh, that's real estate or something.  Yeah.  Selling real estate.  Wow.  You know your shit.  Jimmy knows a lot.  He really do.  He knows a little bit about porn.  Especially about the industry.  Yeah, shows I like and pornography.  I'm your man.  Ask me a math question and I'm finished.  He can rattle off porn names, man. 
[02:45:00]  It's very impressive.  Yeah, no, it's going to be amazing.  I mean, it's actually a really fantastic script.  And it's...  She was a tortured woman.  Yeah, that's like...  Her husband was...  It's been very controversial, though, whether she was a willing participant or whether she  was forced to make the movie because you watch the movie and go, I don't know.  Yeah.  It's still...  We still leave it as a question mark in this film, which I like because the writer really  took a...  Kind of took his own opinion and made it into this film. 
[02:45:30]  And obviously, she was tortured and she was beaten and, you know, brutally kind of forced  into prostitution by her own husband at gunpoint.  And like, so there's some really dark moments.  Yeah.  That's why she was an anti-porn crusader after.  I never knew that about her.  Wow.  Okay.  But the crazy thing is...  I called it being a stick in the mud.  Yeah.  God.  Those women.  But then she went back, right after being an anti-porn crusader, she went back and posed  for Playboy.  Oh, you know that.  Which is really...  So she's a really interesting woman. 
[02:46:00]  She's torn.  She's torn.  Yeah.  She's a little bit confused.  She was.  I mean, she died, unfortunately, in a car crash.  Yeah.  I think we talked to someone from the family.  Yeah, the sister.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Yeah.  We had a very...  Oh, wow.  I have a signed deep throat.  We had a very serious conversation with her.  You have a what?  Signed deep throat.  You do?  You have a signed deep throat.  Open your mouth.  Deep throat.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  You see?  Let's take a look.  What are the bee girls doing here today?  I'm a little distracted.  You can't see this.  What girls? 
[02:46:30]  There's girls just like bees.  They are.  Are they part of what you're promoting?  I'm really confused now.  No, no.  But I'd love to meet the bee girls.  Maybe they have something exciting to promote.  One of the gossip girls was here yesterday, and I wasn't going to get a picture with her,  but I was taping a music show, and I was looking out the window, and I could see up her  skirt, and I'm like, I'm almost obligated to take a photo.  Fantastic.  I wasn't even trying to look.  But you couldn't not.  I just saw butt cheeks hanging out.  Yeah.  Like, what am I, a criminal?  I have to.  No, I agree.  I mean, it's like when boobs are hanging out, you're like, you have to look.  You know what I mean?  You have to peek.  I peek.  I have to.  She's a good egg.  She's great. 
[02:47:00]  I like this.  I like this one.  I like this one.  But you're still liking the B-Girls out there.  Well, no.  It's just a distraction.  It was close.  I just wish I could see it better.  I wish I could see it.  Well, they're over there.  They're going to come by this way out of the mouth.  They're going to buzz by?  Yes.  They'll buzz by.  They're promoting average-sized breasts.  Their average size are great.  And of course, of course.  We've got to mention Watchmen.  I did not see the movie, but when people talk about you, they're like, wow, she was so hot  in that movie.  It's so good in that movie. 
[02:47:30]  That was a lot of fun.  My brother-in-law is losing it.  He's texting me like crazy from Philly.  No way.  He just loved you in that movie.  But I have nothing to say about it because I haven't seen it yet.  Well, you should.  You should definitely see it.  It's a good movie all in all.  All in all?  All in all?  All in all.  Yeah, that works.  It's a fantastic film.  We shot that for six months in Vancouver and did like two months of training pre-movie.  It was a lot of ass-kicking in that film, which was a lot of fun.  And I'd never done any kind of fight training or anything before that. 
[02:48:00]  Sorry, but the B-Girls are now, they're showing their asses.  Hi.  They're showing their asses.  Open the door.  Who is that?  Open the door.  I swear they were just pressing their asses up against the...  Applied from Beez-It.  What are you...  Oh, wow.  Hi.  What are you girls from?  Come on in real fast.  Where are you from?  What?  It's a website.  Beez-It, honey.  Beez-It.  We love Beez-It.  We gave the prize today.  The number one auction site.  Yeah, of course.  And we wanted to give the prize to the pretty girls today.  Really? 
[02:48:30]  Ooh.  I like that.  It was amazing.  Was it really?  What's your name?  I'm Emily.  Where are you from?  I'm from Montreal.  Montreal?  Yeah, I've seen you before.  Yeah?  I've seen you before.  Yeah, she's an actress.  Where have you seen her?  Oh, really?  Well, see?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Montreal is a better city than Toronto, by the way.  No.  What?  Sorry.  Did you just say that?  Do you shop on Beez-It?  Yes, Beez-It.  That's amazing.  You haven't been to Toronto with me. 
[02:49:00]  That's why.  You can get all kinds of name brand items.  99% off of retail.  That's pretty amazing.  It's really good for good kids.  No, it's more amazing.  You're asking.  Can we see them?  Are you from Montreal as well?  Yeah, I'm Leila.  I'm from Montreal, too.  Oh, awesome.  Wow.  What's with all the Canucks in here?  Well, yeah.  See?  Hot ladies come from Canada.  Because we didn't get a chance to get friends with the porn stars, so now we're...  Oh, man.  Are you looking at her as a porn star?  She's not a porn star here.  She's not a porn star.  Oh, the other.  Can we see your...  My boobs are too small to be a porn star. 
[02:49:30]  No, they're not, actually.  They're very perky.  Very perky.  Creepers, that response.  They're perky.  That's all you mean, right?  That's all I mean.  Just a handful.  Are you buzzing around the building and just popping in for Beez-It?  Well, we wanted to know what you thought about last year's Beez-It girls.  They were lovely.  I don't even remember that.  They were lovely people.  Not as good as this year.  Not as good as this year.  Thank you.  That's nice.  Beautiful girl.  Wow.  So, if we make a nice impression, we'll see you again next week.  Yes.  Well, who was pressing their ass up against the glass?  Can we see the ass? 
[02:50:00]  I didn't see that.  Well, I'm sorry.  Oh!  I wanted to cash your attention.  There you go.  Very nice.  Very nice.  But I'm not that kind of girl.  You know, I'm classy.  It's just when you want attention, you have to...  Absolutely.  You really put on a B outfit and show your ass.  You're not that type of girl, though.  We understand you're Canadian.  She's basically saying you're not going to get any.  So, relax.  I thought Catherine Hepburn was classy, but then I saw you with your ass hanging out in  an insect outfit.  And I said...  It's very...  No, you're very pretty.  Very pretty.  I'm not kidding you.  Oh, come on.  Hi, guys.  What did you do?  There they go. 
[02:50:30]  The Beezid girl.  Go to Beezid.com.  The one is carrying her pocketbook around.  She's not even committing to the character.  She's not committing to...  No, man.  She's carrying her fucking pocketbook.  She's not method.  She's not method.  One of them is.  One of them is.  Yes.  The ass-showing one is great.  Don't show her the fart.  The classy ass.  The other one was cute, but she had kind of a weird face.  She had kind of like a man's face.  She looked like you superimposed it.  Oh, the...  But I didn't want them in here.  I thought it was really nice.  Normally, I would have been a lot nicer to them, but she kind of bugged me when she's 
[02:51:00]  showing her ass.  We're trying to chit-chat about the comeback.  She bugged you again.  I don't want to hear her.  Oh, oh, oh.  You don't mess with him.  I know.  He is real fighty.  And she was talking about...  Don't mess around with Jim.  She was talking about her perky boobs.  I know.  We got enough right here.  Yeah, exactly.  We're all good.  We don't need a girl in a bee costume.  We've got a handful, so to speak.  So to speak.  No.  The listeners are falling in love with you by just listening to your voice.  I'm here every day.  No, Jimmy.  Not you.  Oh, her.  Yeah.  But I'm sure they love you, too, Jimmy.  They really do.  They do.  They do.  Oh, James.  Yeah.  So we covered The Watchmen.  We covered Come Back.  I know you were a heartbreak kid.  You were good in that. 
[02:51:30]  Thank you so much.  That was crazy.  That was...  I actually didn't think that I was going to ever get married after anybody watching  that because I was so crazy.  Right.  I actually watched that with my husband, who was not my husband at the time, and I was  like, oh, my God.  Please let him marry me.  Please.  Oh, my God.  Because it was one of those where I was like, really, I'm not going to turn out this way.  What did your husband do?  He's a drummer.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's a session player in Los Angeles.  Any songs for you right now?  For hire, guys. 
[02:52:00]  Any songs for you right now?  Probably not.  He just recorded a couple songs for Carolina Liar.  I don't know if you know those guys.  I've heard the name.  They've been touring around a bit now.  But he mostly does just new up-and-coming artists.  Oh, he did this.  That was him, right?  That was him.  Oh, my God.  You heard it.  I just wanted to make sure.  Yeah.  That was like a hit song in Japan.  Great.  Yeah.  Really, really, really good.  Really good.  Are you still in the Pedal Stones?  Is that accurate?  No.  That was how I met my husband. 
[02:52:30]  You know that.  He was the drummer in Pedal Stones, which was a band that we had back in 2004.  Oh, look at you.  Really?  2003, 2004, when I decided that I sucked as an actress and decided to start a band.  I don't want to see that.  Oh, my God.  I love you.  Whoa.  But decided to sing, which I also sucked at at that time.  Really?  But basically, just did that for a year and a half and got a husband out of it instead.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  That's great.  Well, at least you got a husband out of it, and then you go back to acting, and you're  successful.  Did you read the sheet?  That works.  Screw everything.  What?  She was voted sexiest woman in Sweden.  Yes, I did read that.  Holy.  You know how hot the women are in Sweden?  I was actually on the voting committee.  Well, yeah.  Oh, are you, Jimmy?  I certainly was.  You were the one that put her over?  I was the first one to say aye.  Such a big comeback fan.  Put her over.  Yeah, but guys, that's like...  That is more impressive than anything, because the women over there are beautiful.  Yeah, exactly.  But I bet you they vote, like, every minute.  So they need a new woman every minute, because there's too many hot women over there. 
[02:53:30]  I was like, guys, you're mistaken.  There's so many beautiful women.  It's incredible.  What language is Swedish?  Obviously, I'm glad I caught myself before I asked asshole of the century question.  We speak Spanish in Sweden.  So do you...  How could you say something in...  Could you say something in Swedish?  Yeah, what would you like me to say?  Yes.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Det är jättekul att vara med dig.  Jag älskar att du älskar min sjå.  Nice.  That's really sexy.  I know it doesn't mean what I want it to mean.  Nope.  Which is like, I've left him, and I'll be over in a few minutes. 
[02:54:00]  It probably means something else.  Like, if you had a stronger chin, maybe.  I will never tell you.  You just keep fantasizing about it.  He's been farting all morning.  Oh, God.  He doesn't want you to know that, because you're so beautiful.  But it was for something else we were doing.  Okay.  Okay.  We're, you know...  You gotta cut it out.  You don't want to explode.  Absolutely.  We wear many hats on this show.  Yes.  Can you talk about how horrendous...  They all have propellers on them.  Can you...  In Sweden, Swedish...  Sweden.  You want me to go to Sweden?  In Sweden-ish. 
[02:54:30]  Talk about how horrendous his farts are.  But make it sound sexy.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  I think we just bonded.  I think so, too.  Yeah, I think we did.  Oh, that's the way you want to bond with somebody.  You're beautiful.  Nice smell bad.  Over farts in Swedish.  So, now, what did you say?  I said, your farts are so gross, I can't even believe it.  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  It sounds so much nicer in Swedish.  Yeah.  It doesn't sound lovely in Swedish.  It was wonderful, man.  Thank you.  The movie you're promoting now is called Happy Thank You More, Please, and it's in theaters  tomorrow.  It's a very limited release, which means that there is always the possibility of a greater,  a larger release.  Yeah.  And always DVD.  Yeah, look, a lot of them do go to DVD, but it's cheaper than promoting them, I think,  for a theater release.  What is the movie about, and who do you play?  It's actually a really cute movie, guys. 
[02:55:30]  I would highly recommend it.  But it's three different couples who are trying to sort of figure out their lives in their 30s,  and I play a woman who has alopecia universalis, which is where you lose all of your hair.  So I'm actually bald and shaved off my eyebrows for this.  What the hell are they uglying you up for?  Well, you know.  You should never ugly yourself.  It was actually pretty, it was actually pretty, like.  You got a good head?  Cool looking and beautiful. 
[02:56:00]  It was kind of gorgeous, and my husband kept calling me an angel.  You got a good head?  I got a good head.  You got a good head.  I got a good head, guys.  Was it kind of fun, though?  I actually didn't shave my head, though.  Was it fun?  You didn't?  No.  We did a bald cap.  I wasn't that brave.  I wasn't that brave.  Why?  That is like, wow.  Yeah.  It was a little too much, but we did all those head wraps all the time, so there wasn't  really...  Oh, okay.  Right.  Yeah.  There was no necessity to shave them, but the eyebrows came off, for sure.  The eyebrows came off.  How long does it take to grow back?  Like, maybe two months, but the best part was right after I shaved them off, there was 
[02:56:30]  a girl who was like, she was one of the actresses, and she comes in, she's like, oh my god, did  you just shave off your eyebrows?  I was like, yeah, yeah, I did.  She's like, wow, my mom did that in the 70s, and they never grew back.  Oh, damn.  Thanks.  That's great.  Thanks for telling me now, after the fact.  To Miss Yvonne did.  She plucks the ball out, then she draws the bitch, and she goes, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Did you pencil them in after the movie was done shooting?  Yeah, every now and then.  I left them at some points, and it's funny to watch people just kind of look at your face 
[02:57:00]  and go, what is that?  What is that?  Something's wrong, yeah.  Something's gone.  Yeah.  Something's not there.  Yes.  That's pretty brave, man.  It was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  It's a really cool movie, and obviously because she's a bald woman, you kind of have to figure  that she has a lot of obstacles in her life when it comes to finding love.  True.  Oh, so she's bald forever?  Alopecia doesn't go away?  No, it doesn't.  What do you do if you have alopecia?  You invest in a lot of hats?  You live.  Yeah, you invest in scarves and hats, or you go bald, and you go bald. 
[02:57:30]  Is it a form of cancer or no?  No, it's not related whatsoever, but a lot of people think it's cancer patients because  it looks very similar.  But you can't grow hair at all, or you grow it and it falls out?  You grow it and it falls out, usually.  And a lot of times there are different kinds of alopecia, but this one specifically, the  alopecia universalis, it never really grows back.  Oh, wow.  But some alopecia, you can get like...  Mars had alopecia.  Splotches.  Back at XM when we first started over there.  Yeah, he had it.  Oh, damn, we thought he had it. 
[02:58:00]  The whole one where he's bald?  Yeah, you remember when Mars looked like noodles?  The noodles from the offspring.  That's hilarious.  We thought he was contagious.  Oh, yes.  You guys never talked to him?  Poor guy.  No, we really did kind of shun him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His head looked like an aerial view of Dubai.  It was just creepy.  Yeah, I remember that.  I didn't know that.  What happened to him?  He got over it?  Yeah, it was like stress-related or something.  I can't remember, but he was taking...  Yeah, it came to be stress-related.  What was he taking?  The hair pill.  What is it now?  Propecia?  Propecia, yeah.  Propecia got it all back for him.  Are you serious?  Wow, that's amazing. 
[02:58:30]  I didn't realize he came back.  My bro-law is texting.  Yeah?  What's he saying?  There's two.  Okay.  The first one's safe.  She was on Two and a Half Men.  I was?  Yeah, no?  No.  I was on How I Met Your Mother.  How I Met Your Mother.  Maybe they're mistaken.  Did you have a threesome on Entourage?  I did.  Okay.  Well, that's the better one anyway.  Yeah.  She also had the hot-ass threesome with Sloan and E on Entourage.  Yeah.  Tell her me and her made love many times.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:59:00]  Is this your brother-in-law?  What a creep.  Yeah.  Who are the two characters in Entourage?  Thank you, I think.  Who plays them?  Emmanuel Shrieky and Kevin Connolly.  Okay, I know who Kevin is.  I don't know who Emmanuel is.  Emmanuel Shrieky.  You don't know who Emmanuel is.  I don't watch Entourage.  You should look her up on your computer.  She is one of the hottest.  Oh, does she?  I thought it was a he.  No, it's a woman.  That's why I was thinking like some guy to say that it's a hottest threesome and it  was two guys and a girl.  It was basically me and Emmanuel.  And when you see Emmanuel, you will understand why. 
[02:59:30]  She is the hottest thing ever.  Is the scene on the internet?  Maybe we should check it out.  Okay, but that's not a great picture of her.  Come on.  You got to get a good one.  Did you have to kiss her?  I did.  And it was so funny because on the day, Kevin came in and he was so nervous and he brought  a bottle of wine and we're like, dude, this is, I mean, you're not even kissing.  It's me and Emmanuel.  He was trying to wine and dine us.  Yeah.  We're like, you're not getting any action, honey, but you can watch.  Oh, okay.  That's Emmanuel.  Well, that's a very nice photograph.  That's nice, but she leaves her car door open. 
[03:00:00]  See?  Very rude of her, right?  Of course.  Someone's going to drive by and take that door right off.  Insurance won't cover that.  That's a guy who misses the point.  A guy who misses the point.  Exactly.  Look at you.  Totally.  Totally.  You're totally missing the point.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Let's be very honest, she looks fantastic, but that green, can you please put that awful  institution green wall?  Again, just missing the point.  She's lovely.  She's an amazing woman, too, and now one of my best friends.  She clashes with her shoes.  She was sitting on her side and her legs were in a very sexy pose where you can see kind 
[03:00:30]  of like the bottom of somebody's ass, but you can't say anything.  Classily.  Yeah, just like the butt sheet where the butt meets the leg, that little plump part is really  sexy.  Do you like that part?  Yeah.  And the way I described it is really creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  The way you described it.  It wasn't very sexy, the plump part.  No, the plump part that just comes.  That's the way you describe it to somebody who's tied up.  Like a pudding.  I thought you liked elbows, you've told us over the years.  You do?  I do.  Look at this one.  Look at that.  He likes them in the ribs. 
[03:01:00]  I'm so used to being driven into my chin when I'm talking to a woman.  Have you noticed Jimmy has no hair on his arm?  Look at how...  I don't know why.  It's like...  I got her good.  Oh wow, you got her really good with that one.  That's one of his old gags.  Oh my god.  Pulls that one all the time.  I know.  I'm a very wispily haired man.  It's wispily.  It's very soft.  He has the best calves in the business though.  Really?  He'll brag all day about his calves.  What business?  How do you keep your calves in shape?  In the business of show.  In the business of show.  Yeah, in show business.  In the serious business. 
[03:01:30]  I actually have the 73rd best calves in radio.  Really?  I don't want to break...  Yeah, you know.  73rd?  Wow.  I'm not in Rush.  He's 72nd.  Rush.  He's really fat.  He's carrying a lot more weight than I do.  Is there a line that you have in a role that you would take where you might say no?  Like, you know, nudity, something like that?  Yes, there is definitely a line.  It's always one of those things where if it's gratuitous, I probably won't do it.  Or I won't do it.  But if it's for the movie, then absolutely. 
[03:02:00]  Like in Heartbreak Kid, it was crazy and so much fun.  And guys, honestly, who has sex with their clothes on?  You know what I mean?  It's got to be real.  Well, it depends on how big a hurry you're in.  Well, that's true.  That's true.  Actually, there is the frisky sex.  All the better to wipe the mace out of your eyes with.  I don't like somebody.  See, Anthony likes total nudity.  I prefer somebody to have something on.  I like that.  Burka. 
[03:02:30]  Just something.  I prefer something.  Like, I like clothes on that's kind of dirtier that way.  Something a little bit taboo about it.  Yeah.  Okay.  And where do you like to have it with the burka on?  No, no.  I don't like the burka.  I just like a skirt that's hiked up.  It's sexier to me than total nudity because it's something a little bit taboo about it.  I don't mind that at the beginning.  Just learn something more.  But at some point, there has to be no clothing involved.  From tip of the head to toes, nothing.  What about just pulling something aside? 
[03:03:00]  That's hot.  That's hot, right?  That's hot.  Yes.  Until it slips out of your hand.  Hang on.  Let me just grab a pen.  I'm taking it.  You want to write this down?  Yeah, I do.  I don't like to be naked, though.  Like, I always like to wear black socks and a 1920s football helmet.  But you've got to show your calves.  Your calves.  You've got to show them off.  Get down to business.  That's what gets you your actions.  Well, yeah, but they're always around my ankles because they highlight.  People look at the black side.  They look up and they see the calves.  Actually, those garters that you wear to hold the socks up look good.  I break them like the Hulk.  I can't wear sock garters. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, my God.  They break.  It's so sexy.  With a guy with socks on.  Oh, my God.  Just hiked up to the knee.  Yeah, pulled all the way up.  Absolutely.  Moonwalk across the linoleum.  Just don't put dessert for that shit.  They love it.  I'm ready.  Hey, what cities is this being released in, by the way?  Because it said limited release.  Do you know?  I'm not sure, but I know New York and Los Angeles for sure.  Those are the good ones.  Those are the good ones.  There's a lot of other great ones.  It's not all that matters.  That's what I say.  Well, when you're in those cities, yes.  Sorry, Chicago.  But I hope it's all over the place. 
[03:04:00]  But I'm not quite sure.  Who else is in this?  Josh Radner from How I Met Your Mother.  Who cares who else is in it?  There might be women who want to go see it who won't be in love with her.  Kate Mara.  Oh, yeah.  She was just in 127 Hours.  Okay.  I didn't see that.  Who else is in it?  Zoe Kazan.  Pablo Schreiber.  Oh, he's in Lights Out.  He was in The Wire.  He was in Season 2 of The Wire.  Pablo Schreiber is great.  Which one did he play in The Wire?  He played the smart cousin who was a doc worker, but his father or his uncle worked as the lead doc. 
[03:04:30]  I forget his name in the show, but he was the smart sensible.  He was Ziggy's cousin.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, he's great.  Sure.  He's fantastic.  He's really great.  Really good acting in this.  Really great.  Let me check it out.  And Josh Radner actually wrote, directed, and starred in it, which was quite amazing.  I got a copy last night.  I should have watched it before she did it.  I had one, too.  That would have made sense, I think.  What were you doing in the same?  I was taping Sean Hannity's show.  No.  I was doing TV.  For me, it was legit.  But they just did other things.  If you want to know, my son has decided that he needs to shit in such a way where it's all the way up to the back of his neck. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  So I was cleaning that up.  So they had to take him out of headstand class.  How old is your son?  Ten months.  Ten months.  Okay.  Okay.  That's acceptable.  But something's going on because now it goes all the way up his back to the back of his neck.  That is very interesting.  I mean, what are you thinking?  It was a lot of fun.  I guess too much.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, right?  And then he's 19, which is just...  It's beyond reasonable. 
[03:05:30]  That's what I was doing instead of watching from Happy Thank You More Please.  Is that the...  Or Happy Thank You More Please.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  That's all right.  You're like the lead in this, though.  It's an ensemble cast.  One of them.  One of the...  You're the lead.  Just tell them when you're the lead.  Sure.  You should be the lead.  If you want to hear that, I'm the lead.  You're a very good actress.  Thank you so much.  I just hope they don't show that thing about us talking about cocaine.  Remember that?  What?  In the comeback, they kept...  Oh, yeah.  He kept saying it, and they kept showing it.  He's like, we talked about cocaine. 
[03:06:00]  He kept saying the same thing.  It's amazing.  It's such a good episode.  It's all I want to talk about.  I've got to watch the rest of them.  Yeah.  It's kind of weird.  I haven't seen it in a while.  You have to, like, plow through it.  Dude, I've poured over every...  There's a...  The show, to me, it's like the thing that there's a half hour, and every minute was full.  There was no waste of time in that show.  It was so...  Uncomfortable.  ...fucking great.  That was a terrible decision.  Fantastic writers, yeah.  And Matt LeBlanc, we had in here, and he was promoting his show on Showtime, and we  talked about that, of course, because anybody connected to it, I'll talk to. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Lisa Kudrow, I've never met, but believe me.  Did he watch it?  Yes, but he said it was hard for him because he knows Lisa, and he loves her.  And to watch her be treated that way was difficult.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow, fascinating.  I think a lot of people felt that way.  But she was a self-centered ass in that, too.  Like, she really was the maker of her own trouble.  She made it all about herself, and she was saying, like, you know, the girls like us  with the tabloids, and nobody wanted her picture.  She was...  Yeah.  It was such a sad, sad character in an amazing way.  I thought it was incredible.  She actually created that, I think, way back in the day when she was at Groundlings. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  Before Friends, she had this character, and then decided to do it much later.  Wow, and the Friends thing made it...  That's probably why people thought it was a documentary, because it's like, oh, God.  Yeah, exactly.  It fits perfectly on a popular show, and then...  If you remember, people, I was the one that brought that show to everybody's attention.  What show?  The Comeback?  Yes.  The Comeback.  Oh, really?  Yes, I was.  Colin Quinn brought it to my attention.  Yeah.  I remember Colin telling me about it.  I saw it the first day it was on, and I came the next day on the air and said, I saw 
[03:07:30]  a really good show last night, and you guys were like, oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  See?  Maybe.  Why are you such a buzzkill?  I might have been out of the studio that day, though.  We're having a good time with this girl.  Or I might have been on the toilet again.  Because now we're going to argue.  He just wants to point fingers.  Because now we're going to argue about this.  I have no idea.  Colin Quinn said to me, I remember Colin telling me, he goes, there's a show.  He goes, it's so uncomfortable.  You got it.  That's how he introduced the Comeback to me.  He said it was so uncomfortable. 
[03:08:00]  And after the British office, I'm like, nothing will come close, because it's all forced  awkwardness.  Yeah.  That was amazing.  A lot of people came up to me, and they're like, I'm trying to watch your show.  And I'm like, what do you mean you're trying?  Like, it's just too uncomfortable.  But isn't that great?  Like, people, why don't people love that?  How great was Mickey, the fucking, he would give shitty personal information about his  dumb life at the worst moments.  Like, in the last episode, she's watching the Tonight Show.  She's supposed to go on the Tonight Show.  And who was it?  Cameron Diaz is going over.  Somebody was going over.  So she's going to get bumped. 
[03:08:30]  And she's like, she's going over.  She's not getting off.  And he goes, I'm bringing my lover to your party.  And she's like, who gives a shit?  It was amazing.  It was the most enraging timing of his fucking boring personal information.  And you know, Mickey was actually, he was, he was not an actor before that.  Oh, really?  No.  He, I think he was a school teacher.  Wow.  I looked at his IMDb.  I didn't, I looked at all the IMDb.  I was like, why does this guy not have a longer?  Yeah.  He was, it was kind of one of his first, and Michael Patrick King knew Mickey and sort 
[03:09:00]  of wrote this role for him, which was fascinating.  And he did such a good job.  That's a great, great show.  Maybe they could bring it back.  I mean, look, there's always room for season two.  She comes back a few years later.  I love that.  But I'm back.  Everyone is bringing up Children's Hospital.  Oh.  What is that?  It's a great little TV show that I've been doing where we just finished shooting season  three.  It's on the Cartoon Network.  It's Adult Swim.  Adult Swim.  Okay.  But they're like, she's so good in this.  Oh my God.  Thanks, guys.  Is it drama, comedy? 
[03:09:30]  It's comedy.  It's Rob Corddry created it.  Do you guys know Rob Corddry?  Oh, yeah.  Rob Corddry and David Wayne.  And it's a really great cast.  Lake Bell is in it.  Megan Mullally.  Okay.  Henry Winkler is on it.  We have a really great cast.  And we're basically really incompetent doctors who don't know how to be doctors in a children's  hospital.  I have seen an episode or two of this.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  They love it.  Yes, I have.  It's so crazy.  The listeners love this show.  Now it looks very familiar.  How annoyed does Henry Winkler get when people just keep walking up going, hey. 
[03:10:00]  He's the loveliest person.  Yeah.  He'll say, hey, right back at you.  You know what I mean?  I went to a book signing and creeped him out.  He was doing a reading, so I wanted to get a picture of him.  Of children's books?  Yeah.  He writes children's books from Henry Winkler.  He has like 12 children's books.  It's very successful.  Yeah.  Eat your vegetables.  Whoa.  Yeah.  It's like that.  But he relates everything to Happy Days.  One time when Cunningham.  But he's a great speaker on stage, too.  He's a very charismatic guy, and he reads, and he's very comfortable, like, live performing. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, and he's hilarious.  He reads and writes, guys.  Oh, that's great.  No, he's amazing.  It's kind of incredible to be working with fans.  You're making us watch a lot of stuff now.  We've got to watch the rest of the comeback.  The comeback, you have to just buy.  I'm enriching your life.  You can thank me later.  Will you come back when you become even bigger?  Yeah, absolutely.  You had fun today?  I had a great time, guys.  If you talk to Lisa Kudrow, would you kind of just mention that we would be very nice  to her, whatever she wants to promote?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  I've been dying to interview her.  I think she has a new web show.  Doesn't she?  I don't know.  Yeah, she does. 
[03:11:00]  You might want to watch it.  Don't promote her stuff.  I think she plays...  Promote yourself.  Yeah.  Promote yourself.  But no, that's what friends do.  That's what friends do.  Lisa gave her a big break, right?  She gave me my break, basically.  That was my break into the business.  That's pretty cool.  No, you helped her out.  Yeah, you were the voted sexiest woman in Sweden.  You helped her out.  In what?  In like 2005 or something?  Was it?  Right?  Yeah.  Because that's when the comeback was.  Exactly.  It worked out.  It's not like it was a big difference.  You segued right from there and that's an in.  I think we just can't talk to pretty women. 
[03:11:30]  We're just...  You guys are great.  We're having lovely conversations.  We're the worst, though.  We are bad at that.  No, you're not.  You're amazing.  She has to go.  What did we do wrong?  Oh, boy.  Usually that means we did something wrong.  No, she probably has TV.  Oh, we didn't do anything wrong this time?  Oh, good.  I don't think you did anything wrong.  No.  Sometimes they say she has to go, meaning we did something wrong.  No, you even gave me a few tips on sexual adventures.  Exactly.  Socks, son.  Socks.  Sock garters, hats.  Old leather football helmets.  Yeah.  Can I get an awkward, sexy picture for Twitter?  An awkward, sexy picture? 
[03:12:00]  Well, because it's weird that I'm asking you.  Okay.  All right.  But I want it to come out nice for you.  Okay.  That would be great.  All right.  What do I do?  How do I pose as an awkward, sexy picture?  No, I want it to be sexy.  Yeah, tweet it.  Tweet it.  That's what I'm asking.  One of the goddesses.  One of the goddesses.  No, no.  I don't want Jimmy in there.  You have a little little girl.  Oh, Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy.  That looks good.  Jimmy's making his cool guy face.  You were looking down.  What a tool.  She was looking down.  All right.  All right.  Let's do another one.  Let's do another one.  I'm learning a lot today, guys. 
[03:12:30]  So how should I place my head?  I like the look, though.  It was beautiful.  Okay.  They're going to love it.  Jimmy, you have to be in this.  He's my pimp.  All right.  In three, two, one.  Jimmy, your eyes were closed.  That's all right.  I was enjoying the moment.  That's perfect.  All right.  That's perfect.  He was fantasizing about it.  Look how beautiful.  Look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Early in the morning with the boys.  Hanging with the guys.  Yeah.  And look at Jimmy.  I mean, you look great.  He's like a little stalker in the background. 
[03:13:00]  Do you have a Twitter that we're supposed to promote or anything?  I don't have a Twitter.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Gene, a million fucking followers in one day.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well, you know, I don't have a story like his, so.  You could do good.  All right, listen.  We're all going to check out Happy, Thank You, More Please in theaters tomorrow.  Limited release, but it might expand from there.  Yeah, please do.  And you were really, really cool.  Thanks.  It was great being here.  Children's Hospital, we should check it out.  And Electrolux is another film that's coming out.  Okay.  Electrolux.  With Carla Gugino and Emmanuel Tricky.  Could you come back and promote that?  Yeah, sure.  We'd love to have you back.  It's coming out this Friday, though. 
[03:13:30]  So, there you go.  I just promoted it.  Yeah.  This Friday?  Tomorrow?  Yeah, tomorrow.  Oh, you got two movies coming out tomorrow.  Damn.  So, you guys will have to keep busy.  Well, that's cool.  Go do a double feature.  I have a gig in Jersey Saturday in Montclair.  Yes.  Kind of like two movies.  Totally.  Same thing.  All right, Maylin Ackerman, this was a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  Thank you guys so much for having me.  And we'll see you next time.  And I think we're done.  Jimmy, you want to promote?  Just, I have that one gig Saturday night, and then I'm coming to San Francisco to Cobbs  next week.

[03:16:00]  I hurt myself today.  Did you?  To see if I still feel.  Well, do you?  I focus on the pain.  Did you?  The only thing that's real.  Is it?  The needle tears a hole.  Does it?  The old familiar sting. 
[03:16:30]  Is it?  I try to kill it all away.  Do you?  But I remember everything.  Do you?  What have I become?  My sweetest friend.  Everyone I know.  Goes away.
