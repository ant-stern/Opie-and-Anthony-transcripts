<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language.  The show began with a discussion about the hosts' dissatisfaction with their SiriusXM management under Scott Greenstein, contrasting him unfavorably with their previous manager, Eric Logan.  This led to jokes about Anthony's appearance, particularly his eyebrows, comparisons to Christian Bale's "Machinist" look, and speculation about cosmetic procedures.  They also criticized Sam Roberts' video editing work,  complained about workload and deadlines, and discussed their upcoming Comic Con trip with Jim Norton.  The hosts also expressed disbelief and amusement regarding Brother Wheeze's new beer-themed radio show format, and dedicated significant time to jokes about Scott Shannon’s age and appearance, including analyzing an old video clip of him.  Anecdotes about E-Rock’s past fondness for the Scott and Todd show were shared, along with a clip of Jim Norton recounting a humorous airplane encounter with Al Sharpton. The segment concluded with a discussion about the film *Poltergeist* and the tragic deaths of some of its cast members.

The next segment opened with a discussion of the Rebecca Schaeffer murder and her killer, transitioning into a discussion of other notorious killers like BTK and the subsequent stabbing of Schaeffer's killer in prison.  The conversation shifted to personal anecdotes about dealing with stalkers,  followed by offensive remarks about Cooper Lawrence and Patricia McCann. A listener called in with a method for calculating breast weight using water displacement, prompting a joke about a similar method for penis size.  A pre-recorded interview with Donald Sutherland was played.  The show then covered the Napster trial,  problems with their SiriusXM video content, and the inefficiency of their web team. A significant portion focused on a conflict between Opie and E-Rock over E-Rock’s unauthorized copying of Opie's phone photos, including pictures with Oprah Winfrey and Opie's mother-in-law.  This included accusations and disagreements, followed by a call from an Australian listener that led to comedic impressions of Australian accents.  The segment concluded with further discussion of technical issues, a request for a montage of the show's opening sounds, and a personal anecdote about a host experiencing data loss.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered around E-Rock and his habit of archiving photos and files belonging to the hosts and guests. Opie initially expressed annoyance at E-Rock's possession of numerous photos he thought he'd lost, including one with Oprah.  This discussion expanded to accusations of "digital hoarding," comparisons to the character from "One Hour Photo," and speculation about E-Rock's motives, ranging from helpful backup to potential blackmail.  Studio guest Troy Kwan shared his own experience, with other guests, including Sal, adding anecdotes about E-Rock's behavior, including accusations of secrecy, minimized applications, and even spyware.  The discussion included much joking, playful insults, and sexually suggestive language, culminating in a comedic back-and-forth and a somewhat conciliatory ending, with Opie expressing gratitude for E-Rock saving his photos.  An upcoming party and Comic-Con were also mentioned.


Further discussion of E-Rock continued, focusing on his "sneaky" acquisition of a Jägermeister machine and other memorabilia from K-Rock.  His character was debated, described as both kind and sneaky.  The discussion included tangents on obtaining an Elijah Wood autograph, Spam and its promotional girl (including a caller impersonating a Spam character),  Daniel Tosh's rape joke controversy (and a strong defense of Tosh's right to edgy comedy and condemnation of heckling), and a story about leaving E-Rock to find his own way home after a Rolling Stones concert. A therapist, Steve, called in to offer his perspective on E-Rock's behavior, characterizing him as a passive-aggressive enabler. The segment featured numerous interruptions, vulgar language, off-color jokes, and pre-recorded audio clips.

The broadcast also included an extensive discussion on Daniel Tosh’s rape jokes, with Opie arguing the subjective nature of offensive humor and advocating for audience members to simply leave if offended.  This led to a profane debate about comedy, freedom of speech, and audience expectations, including a discussion of a George Carlin bit about rape.  The conversation shifted to a past incident involving the alleged mistreatment of a DJ, Carol Miller, and Opie's tendency to dismiss past offenses.  E-Rock was again the subject of much criticism,  with a recurring joke about him being a "battered wife."  Several callers weighed in, and the show touched upon its international fanbase, particularly in Australia, leading to discussions about Australian culture and humor, including a segment on a viral video and a comical misidentification during a phone call. The segment ended with a discussion about the show's interns, Connor and Rob, their on-air blunders,  a false accusation, and a subsequent discussion on disciplining them.

The final segment discussed Roland's recent absence from work, his claim of illness, and the fallout with the talent department, potentially related to Bryan Cranston's booking.  Roland revealed he was in the building but hidden, and discussed ongoing tension and potential disciplinary action. The conversation included jokes about Roland "going panda crazy," and shifted to Comic-Con, Roland's experiences with press, and a segment involving EROC. A playful, yet tense, back-and-forth with Eric ensued, discussing Eric’s perceived tendency to find faults, referencing his Fourth of July Ho-Ho and Mission Impossible marathon.  Troy was mentioned, with references to a past slight and a delayed wedding gift. The conversation concluded with a discussion of the hosts' relationships and the forgivability of certain actions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice kiddo.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on SiriusXM's satellite radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, let's do this fucking thing.  Once again.  Holy shit.  Let's just plow through this shit one more time.  Something has to change.  Yeah.  We were having a little discussion before the show.  Something has to change.  Something you've got to give.  It doesn't even have to be a big change.  Nah.  Just anything.  It doesn't have to be earth-shattering.  Just something.  We're in a position where it can be something so insignificant, yet it will be huge to us 
[00:02:00]  because it's something different.  Oh, please.  We're in a gilded cage.  Oh, wait.  Do we have bosses at this point?  I haven't seen any of them.  What's going on with Liberty Media?  Are they buying this place?  Are they spinning it off?  What are they doing?  I don't know.  What's going on?  I haven't seen anything happen with this stack.  I see they're creeping up with their ownership.  Have you walked down the hallway and seen those guys in the suits?  And when you pass them, they're like...  And then what we need to do is...  Hurrah.  Hurrah. 
[00:02:30]  Hurrah.  And you just hear it like, come and go.  Oh, really?  And as I'm saying, there's something about the guys coming to myself.  And you're like, oh, how does that affect my job?  I got a real question.  I'm not being a dick.  Yeah.  Does Scott Greenstein work here?  Does he still work here?  I don't even know.  I haven't seen him in a while.  I've seen him once since November.  I would assume.  I would assume.  I guess he's like the new Eric Logan for us.  I guess.  Like, he's in that same position.  Yeah.  Eric Logan we would see and talk to every day.  I've seen Scott Greenstein. 
[00:03:00]  Not that I want to, by the way.  I've seen him once since November.  What month are we up to?  July?  Maybe he heard you and is giving you what you want.  Not talking to you.  Oh, no.  He doesn't hear shit.  We all know that.  I got it.  I got it.  He doesn't hear shit.  No?  Jeez.  Seeing him one time in eight months.  That's good.  That's wonderful.  Are you complaining?  I don't know.  I know what you're trying to say.  I know.  Yeah, I hear you.  It's like a catch-22. 
[00:03:30]  It really is.  It really is.  We don't want to deal with any bosses.  But Eric Logan kind of allowed us to deal with a boss.  You don't want to deal with them, but you don't want them to not have anything going on.  You want to go like, oh, okay, something's...  Somewhere in the middle, I guess.  Once they start chatting with our agent, we are persona non grata around this place.  Let's be honest.  Eric Logan was a bit needy and had his own sound machine and shit.  Oh, my God.  Wasn't he?  He used to call up.  He'd love when the listeners identified him and talked to him. 
[00:04:00]  And then Greenstein, not so much.  I don't know.  Does he even recognize himself when he looks in the mirror?  You know what?  When you're in that close with the Miramax people...  Is he?  Yeah, well, you know what?  We heard.  Is he?  We heard.  Is he?  I've seen the shitty movie posters in his office.  It's not that impressive.  Let's all relax.  Let's all relax.  He's been bragging about that for 10 years.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:04:30]  I think he penciled his name on the bottom of one.  I was involved in that.  Oh, my God.  I produced that.  I'm so glad it's finally coming out.  When we had the secret meeting in the hotel suite...  Yeah, I remember that.  ...way before we...  I don't know.  X7 Sirius were...  So they were begging to have us right before Howard said,  all right, I'll take the job.  Then they got Howard and then Scott Greenstein,  because he's a terrific guy,  then completely blew us off.  And we couldn't get a phone call.  Couldn't even get a phone call.  Didn't even know what was going on,  because he's a wonderful guy. 
[00:05:00]  And then we even saw him at lunch,  and he panicked that he saw us in the same restaurant  and made believe he didn't know who we were.  I never forgot that.  But anyway, he bragged from day one about his movie posters.  I call them movie posters.  I've done.  I've done.  I've done.  I've done movie posters in my basement.  What's wrong, Sam?  Huh?  What's wrong?  What do you mean?  Sam's like, don't fuck up my 18 shows.  All right.  I do 23 shows on this fucking platform.  Don't fuck them up.  We're just entertaining the people.  That's all.  Not all the people.  By the way, your eyebrows look horrendous in every picture. 
[00:05:30]  What are you talking about?  How many pictures of me?  Why are you obsessed with his eyebrows?  Well, I'm not.  But listeners, the pictures you took during the UFC,  people are like, what is going on?  There's one picture where your brow line just came in on the corner of a shot.  I think it was of Jimmy and Bob.  Oh, yeah.  And you just looked.  It was horrific.  It was like caveman.  Well, I'm sorry if I'm not attractive enough for the male listeners.  That's my gig.  I say that. 
[00:06:00]  Anthony, were you ugly fuck?  All right.  It's a guy.  Look, I like when the listeners say I'm attractive.  Although Bill Burr nailed me pretty good the other day.  What did he do?  I took a picture.  I was in the pool.  Yeah.  And I took a picture of myself because somebody was ragging on me.  And I was like, hey.  And then people go, why are you?  It's a nice day, Anthony.  Why are you bashing people on Twitter?  You should be hanging out.  I'm like, hey, here's where I'm tweeting from.  And it was me in the pool.  Right.  I don't care.  Self-shot.  Yeah.  Self-shot. 
[00:06:30]  And Bill Burr tweeted something that said,  how come Anthony's head looks 20 years older than his shoulders?  Because I was all tan.  And I had like, I had like that muscle line going from my neck to my shoulders.  And it was, it was nice.  And then my head just looked like a fucking troll.  Why don't we put a younger head on your body?  I should.  I said, I need a trainer for my head.  We could do a Ted Williams thing.  I can't fucking work that out.  We could freeze his head.  I think I need a lift.  Should I get a lifetime lift or something? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, God, no.  I'm never doing it.  That doesn't make no sense.  That doesn't make no sense.  Don't, don't.  No, I'm not doing that.  I swear.  I don't care.  Out of us three, you would absolutely do the lift.  Would I?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think I would do that just because I got my follicles?  Yeah, I'm not saying that.  You think because I did my follicles, I'd get a lift?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, look at this.  Watch, watch, watch.  We've all done that.  Wait, look.  No, I know.  You just go like this.  I've done it too.  No, not eyes.  No eyes.  I don't want eyes done.  Watch this.  Look.  See, you've thought about this.  Ew.  What is that?  I hope he just goes, ew.  I just lifted my cheeks up. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, it works, but ew.  Jesus.  I know.  It is stupid.  I agree.  Is there anybody else that can edit video besides Sam?  I mean, what happened?  What happened?  What's going on, Jimmy?  We're talking about the UFC pictures.  Can't anybody else do the video?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Who fucked up?  No one.  Sam Roberts.  No, I didn't fuck up.  Sam Roberts is a fucking dick.  Sam, you fucked up?  There's only so many hours in the day.  You fucked up.  Gentlemen.  Well, you have to blow off a few of your radio shows.  You know what?  I have to go to San Diego.  Just blow off 10 shows.  10 radio shows. 
[00:08:00]  You got 23 shows still to do.  And then you could get done things that, you know, maybe the moneymaker show, this one.  I'm going to San Diego.  I was in Las Vegas.  Oh, for what?  The after show?  No, for you.  Oh, thanks.  What are you doing there for us?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Jim and I are going to Comic Con.  Oh, wow.  Comic Con is some.  Nice.  And I have, you know, I have the bandolier in the office.  We're ready to go.  Oh, good.  But what does this have to do with your eyebrows?  I don't know.  The listeners don't think I'm pretty enough, but I'll tell you who does like my eyebrows. 
[00:08:30]  The lady.  No, I don't know.  The Muppet eyebrows, and everyone knows it.  Eyebrows grow back.  Could you at least trim them?  No.  To see what they look like?  Or have them threaded?  I'm not going to do that, but they were slightly trimmed at the wedding.  No, they weren't.  By who?  Jess?  No, not Jess.  Trimmed up with a shotgun.  By your mom?  The girl who did, the woman, lady who did Jess's and her bridesmaid's hair.  Oh, so you were cheating.  Yes, by trimming my eyebrows, I mean, we fornicated. 
[00:09:00]  That's the first step.  That's the first step of cheating.  It is?  Yes.  It's for a party.  So, what does this have to do with movie posters?  Oh, God.  With the movie posters?  What happened?  I was going sober with that.  And no, it's okay now.  Yeah.  It is okay.  Because we were talking.  You call them movie posters?  Huh?  You just call them movie posters?  Do you shave and then it grows back in ten minutes?  Or do you ever...  What happens?  What?  My face?  You're grubby.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I haven't shaved in like a week.  It looks terrible. 
[00:09:30]  It really does.  You look like a bum.  No, I don't.  I look fine.  You're a bum, Jules.  You want to be a bum.  Maybe it's just depression setting in.  I don't know.  Is that it?  No.  Marriage is fucked up like that quickly.  Marriage is good.  But what happens is I come in here for some reason, get my balls busted for never...  Are you implying that we're doing that now?  Yes.  No, we're not doing that.  Right?  We wouldn't do that too.  Just like, oh, look at his eyebrows.  What?  Go home and look at pictures of me? 
[00:10:00]  The eyebrows are enraging.  Oh.  We see you live.  We don't have to look at pictures.  My eyebrows...  I could be disgusted at you right now.  Did you know I was in the elevator in Las Vegas and some intoxicated girl said I looked  like Christian Bale?  He's very handsome.  She was really...  She meant in the machinist.  Oh.  She was really fucked up.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think she was that strong.  Yeah.  She was fucked up.  Maybe a little.  You don't see it? 
[00:10:30]  No.  Not?  That's like the time.  And I'm prepared for a lot of laughs.  Trust me.  Let me see.  Was when the lady on Crystal Meth said I looked like Brad Pitt in Florida.  Wait, wait, wait.  Watch.  I think I am seeing a little Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  It's something in the mouth.  Yeah.  His mouth is the same as Christian Bale's.  Fuck.  That's a handsome guy, too.  He's very handsome.  Jesus.  One of the most handsome actors there is.  Yeah.  You want to blow him?  And you can see it, huh?  Well, why don't you do this? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, you can.  Yes!  Do a split screen.  Sam Roberts and Christian Bale?  Yeah.  God.  It is something in the mouth.  Piss me off.  No, I did have a lady say I look like Brad Pitt.  Really?  I know I don't look like Brad Pitt.  I'm not looking for a compliment.  At all.  You won't get one.  All right.  What do you think?  I was going to go, yes, you look like Brad Pitt.  I was in Florida, and this girl, this woman with no teeth, and she was checking into the  same hotel I was.  Did she hit your thigh with a cane?  And she was checking into the same hotel I was because she got the shit beat out of 
[00:11:30]  her by her husband after a night of drinking and drugging.  Nice.  And in the lobby, as loud as she could get, she said, oh my God, you look like Brad Pitt.  And of course I don't.  And I'm like, wow.  How fucked up are you?  Dude, that's almost embarrassing.  Of course it is.  Because it's so far off.  Of course.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I'm not fishing for a compliment. 
[00:12:00]  Trust me.  I know.  It's like, why would she do that?  I bring it up because of how ridiculous it is.  She's got to tame it down a little and make you feel...  All right.  Holy shit.  Perfect love.  Fucking Sam Roberts looks like Christian Bale.  You got to trim the eyebrows.  Dude, trim the eyebrows.  You're crazy.  And then you got a Christian Bale thing going on.  Trim the eyebrows, cut the hair, put some of that lye in it.  Yeah.  And straighten it out, and you would be fucking handsome.  Dude, it's all about the eyebrows.  If you trim that shit down, you absolutely look like him.  You got Bert. 
[00:12:30]  You got Ernie and Bert.  How do you look like Christian Bale?  That's fucked up.  And how did we not know this before?  I don't like that.  His nose...  I'm a handsome guy.  You got one of those chiseled noses.  Yeah.  That like, I think, what's his name?  The first Superman in the movie?  George Reeves.  Yeah.  No, actually, Christopher Reeve.  Let's hope the results are the same.  Yeah.  So we can only hope it's George.  No, no, I wanted to throw a curveball.  Yeah, let's trim the eyebrows down today, so we can see if you look like Christian Bale.  Dude, why wouldn't you fucking do that?  You could be...  You're going to get old and be like, I could have been a fucking contender when I was a kid. 
[00:13:00]  I was almost good looking.  Almost good looking.  Well, now it's obvious.  The eyebrows are fucking up your entire face.  They really are.  You think so?  Yeah.  You got to trim them down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What if I trim them down and they look ridiculous, though?  You could do a whole...  They won't!  Stop it!  Normal eyebrows are going to look silly.  They'll grow back.  They'll grow back.  Hopefully twice as thick.  And you could do a whole podcast.  That'd be great.  You could do a whole podcast on it.  I could bring the mic and everything.  You could bring that.  You could get the person in.  You're going to be the old guy with those giant fucking gray eyebrows that go all the 
[00:13:30]  way out.  Scorsese.  When are you going to...  Yes.  Yeah.  Get a run into...  Scorsese with none of the talent.  I was just about to say that.  He gets by on the talent.  Of course not.  Yeah.  I don't have that.  Anyway.  Come on, Sam.  Anyway, back to the movie posters.  Oh, right.  Movie posters.  And it is a segue to something else.  Because this business is really fucked up, is the point I'm making.  Yeah.  That's all I'm making with this.  Yeah.  You know, you got a boss that you don't even see, which is good and bad, obviously.  I think because he's talking to the agent, though. 
[00:14:00]  What?  They don't want to...  I don't think that shit's going on.  Oh, but think about all the years of negotiations.  Yeah.  They never spoke to us during that time.  Yeah.  None of them.  Yeah, because they want to make us all paranoid.  Yeah.  So they just sit.  They talk to our guy.  That's wonderful.  And we sit there like a bunch of jerk-offs.  Treat one of your top shows like shit.  So you can sign him for less money.  Top show of who?  I said one of them.  Cousin Brucie?  I said one of them.  I put us in the category.  Okay.  But you said top show.  Wait a minute. 
[00:14:30]  The mash-up.  Mash-up?  Yeah.  Right.  Top show.  Horrible.  You know, I go...  Oh, God.  They stink.  Why do you say that?  As individuals, they're nice.  They're nice, Pete.  Any divorces happening over there yet?  Not yet, but it's bound to happen.  It's going to happen.  It's not a good...  She loves the cock.  She loves it so much.  Strange cock.  She misses it every day.  Strange cock.  Strange, yeah.  She said she does.  So, I was talking to Brother Wheeze.  This is where the movie poster thing is going.  Oh.  And I was busting his balls when I was up there in Sotis Bay because I found out Wheeze is probably 
[00:15:00]  like the most popular show on regular radio at this point.  I would have to say.  And they're even fucking with him.  And they changed his station to a new format.  And I cannot believe this is happening.  And I beat the shit out of Wheeze.  And he enjoyed it.  He was laughing, yeah.  Of course.  His station has changed to...  And I can't even look at Jimmy.  Oh, no.  His station changed format.  Oh, no.  And it's now called The Brew. 
[00:15:30]  The Brew?  Ew!  Is it supposed to be like, yeah, The Brew?  There, pop me a brew, bro!  Their logo is a bottle cap.  Oh, no, it is!  It's 95.1 The Brew.  Wheeze has been doing morning radio for, I would have to guess, 30 years.  And he has to deal with a format change where it's called The Brew.  Hey, The Brew, people!  Psh!  Psh!  He goes, I'm in hell, bro!  The Brew! 
[00:16:00]  It gets worse.  He has to.  He has to.  Play sound effects of beers opening.  Stop it.  Remember the Lopwizers?  Stop it.  Remember the Lopwizers?  The station thinks they're going to get ratings by naming themselves after beer?  The Brew.  It stinks.  Holy fuck.  Like that.  Yeah, right.  E-Rock.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Pop one open for me, too.  Pop it open.  I'd like one, but a non-alcoholic brew.  Oh, well, there you go.  Let's all have some brews, gang. 
[00:16:30]  There it is.  Now, at BAB, who did the Friday...  Oh, fucking Mortier.  That was in the 80s, and he was doing the fucking beer.  That was way different, though.  But that was like cutting edge back then.  One of my favorite things on radio ever was Jerry Mortier's happy hour, whatever it was  called.  Friday afternoon happy hour.  He did it so well, people were convinced.  People thought he was in a bar.  He was in a bar every Friday.  It was amazing how well he did it.  But now you can't do the brew and think it's... 
[00:17:00]  The brew.  And you got Wheeze, who's an amazing personality.  Love him or hate him.  He really knows how to fucking run a radio show, and he has the gift of gab.  It's Wheeze's contest.  I'm not seeing grilling and chilling with the brew.  None of this is Wheeze's shit.  He's being forced to do this shit.  Grilling and chilling with the brew.  Chilling.  They're making...  Grilling and chilling.  They're making Wheeze go to somebody's house to grill and chill.  No way.  I think every Friday or something for the summer.  What?  Every Friday?  I don't know. 
[00:17:30]  Or every other Friday?  You gotta go to someone's house every Friday?  And grill and chill?  And chill.  I would grill or chill.  I'm not doing both now.  Will there be brews to be had while people are grilling and chilling?  I would bet a lot of money there's no brews.  Right.  They're afraid of lawsuits.  I'd be doing that snap bottle cap thing into people's eyes.  Like, just fucking pop.  I'm grilling and chilling.  What's that sound effect?  I guess it's going in and out of spots and stuff.  No?  And...  Gotta be on top of the brew.  And usually when you have, like, a strong personality, you leave them the fuck alone and you don't... 
[00:18:00]  We've been there.  Where you leave them out of the nonsense, but radio's changed to the point where they're  like, nope, we need you part of the nonsense, Wheeze.  So he has to play...  Fucking terrible.  Now he has to play a song an hour.  Fucking terrible.  Instead of talking.  And he has to play beer sound effects.  They're making him play more music now?  He doesn't play any music, but now he has to play one song.  Because the format's kind of...  I think it's kind of like 80s.  80s, uh... 
[00:18:30]  80s classic rock.  How long has he been doing radio?  30 years.  Terrible.  Well, I don't know.  At least 30 years.  That sounds terrible.  Adding...  Radio.  They're forcing him...  Radio is the worst thing.  Radio is the worst thing.  Fucking...  They're forcing him to play a song an hour.  And I saw his GM and he thinks we're buddies.  He's at the party and I'm just looking at him.  I'm like, ugh, go away.  I think I made it very clear.  My wife said I made it very clear.  Why would anybody be happy with adding music to a show that's been on the air for 30 years? 
[00:19:00]  Like, that's an institution.  And he's doing well.  He's doing well.  Because there's something called PPMs, which is fucking up everybody.  Those people meters.  They gotta give the man the PPMs.  What else does the station do?  Let's find out.  Do they have any production elements?  I want to...  Chilling and grilling's pretty cool, though.  Uh, Chip likes it.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll have some bros.  We grill, we chill with something.  Yeah, grill, grill, ice kill, you're chilling.  Oh, that's funny, right?  I know it is.  I probably should have told you guys this ahead of time so we could maybe find some of the 
[00:19:30]  good shit.  Well, chilling and grilling sounds fun.  It must be new.  It's real new.  He's like...  He's got to play a song an hour and he's got to play beer sound effects.  Oh!  And he's a legend up there in western New York.  Wait, how...  When does he have to play the beer sound effects?  Fucking abomination.  Huh?  When does he have to play the beer sound effects?  Like when?  Definitely in and out of spots.  Probably while he's talking, too.  He's got to probably sneak one in. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  What cocksucking dummy came up with that?  Sam Roberts?  What?  Oh, sorry.  I thought it was a good idea.  I hear cocksucker.  I just think it's Sam Roberts.  It's part of the iHeart...  Oh, Sam.  iHeart Radio.  Fucking blows.  It's part of the iHeart Radio network.  Why wouldn't you?  I think it's a format that they've decided is...  Yeah, like Jack was.  It's a bunch of jerk-offs...  Oh, remember Jack?  ...who are just...  You're watching a bunch of drowning industry.  And it's funny to watch all these fucking people who are drowning. 
[00:20:30]  These are just like...  These are their arms flailing above the water.  Terrible.  Who enjoys beer sound effects?  Nobody.  Nobody.  Even alcoholics think that's an annoying sound.  Yes.  We don't have any production pieces?  Can you find some Iraq?  You're good at this shit.  Is he?  He knows every fucking radio show.  Oh, it's...  Hey, look!  Jimmy!  Jimmy, what is that?  I don't know.  Why are you on there?  It's Bernie Briefing...  Playing a clip.  ...on Imus, and I see Jim Norton, comedian, and your picture...  You're very handsome in that picture.  Thank you. 
[00:21:00]  When was that taken?  2007.  It's an HBO picture.  Jimmy, that's a...  You're adorable right there.  Thank you.  A lot of handsome guys associated with this show.  Oh, it's obviously a...  All right, look.  Eyebrows.  Clip them and you'll be handsome.  Yeah, we really are a couple of lookers over here.  Before that...  Man, we really set the bar low with this motherfucker.  Clip your eyebrows and you're kind of good looking.  You got a clip or what?  We are going to run the station streaming, and then Sal's going to come in with some of  the production...  Oh, make sure Sal runs that shit.  Man, it's Sal. 
[00:21:30]  Wee's has to do what he's got to do, but...  You know.  Why do they...  Toe the line.  Why do they add him in the nonsense?  Do your nonsense after his show is over.  Yeah, yeah.  And then turn into the brew and have a big party every day.  They love when the morning show's involved with the rest of the day, though.  Right?  Ugh.  Remember that?  Ugh.  Sure.  Ugh.  Just to go to people's houses?  That's fucking horrendous.  We ought to do that.  I remember going to the house with a big screen TV for Super Bowl.  Remember that?  Oh.  Huh?  Wasn't that fun?  Yeah, yeah.  To the idiot that doesn't listen, I said Wee's is the most... 
[00:22:00]  Sam.  One of the most...  Is probably the most popular guy on regular radio.  Yes.  I stand by that statement, you asshole.  He goes, do you smoke crack?  Yeah, but what?  Every radio show has gone away.  He's one of the last ones on regular radio.  Except for...  If you want to talk about political talk, then whatever.  Yeah.  But besides that, doing a regular radio show, yes.  Yes, Wee's is probably the most popular.  Yes.  Who else is?  Who else is left? 
[00:22:30]  Who else is?  Mike D.  Really?  Dope.  Think about it.  There's no one in New York.  There's not...  There's not...  I can't even name a regular radio show in New York at this point.  Name one.  Is Elvis Duran still around?  Elvis Duran is still around.  Is he still around?  Yeah.  All right.  E-Rock would know.  He's a student of that.  And he's syndicated, yes.  Oh, you know that?  Yeah.  Scott and Todd.  Hey.  Scott and Todd.  Come on.  Are they only in New York?  Shut up.  You were a big Scott and Todd fan.  I was.  Look at E-Rock.  E-Rock.  What turned you on to Scott and Todd?  Working for Scott and Todd. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He was a big fan.  You probably liked him before that, though.  He did.  Come on.  You did.  You used to listen.  He liked the song parodies.  I sure hope I could one day meet him.  There's no way anyone actually liked that show.  He liked the prank phone calls.  Loved the prank phone calls.  What do you like about it?  Got him.  Let's ask E-Rock.  Todd nailed him again.  Ha ha.  E-Rock's awesome.  Oh, that Todd.  Oh.  Trying to tell his friends.  Did you hear Scott and Todd today?  They're like, shut up.  They beat him up.  Faggot.  Yeah.  They just punch him in the stomach.  He says it and they just wail him in the stomach.  What do you like about. 
[00:23:30]  For a prank phone call.  What do you like?  Come on.  Let's go.  Yeah.  What happened?  It just was.  I went from Z100's morning show to when he went to PR.  Why did you like that?  What did you like?  Why did you like?  Stop being vague about it.  We understand that you went and started listening to Scott.  You're passionate about it.  What did you like?  What did you like?  We stood up.  It's hard to defend this.  It really is.  What part of the show were you like, yes. 
[00:24:00]  Eric.  Yeah.  Cool.  Love these guys.  We're talking about the old you.  You don't have to defend shit.  Yeah.  At the time, why did you like Scott and Todd?  30, 40 pounds ago.  Because I thought that's how radio was.  Well, it was.  You're right.  Well, give us a specific languishing invagery.  Yeah.  Again.  Watch the news.  Did you feel like they were your friends?  What did you enjoy about it?  My listeners are my friends.  What did you like about it?  Oh, that's a very daigle kid.  It's pretty good.  He's just talented. 
[00:24:30]  He's an airy.  He's got an eager Coke float.  He has little jokes.  Do you think Scott was confused as to why they called him the sex bagel?  Oh, yeah.  Is he a bagel or is he sexy?  I don't know.  Do you know, Todd?  I don't know.  I live vicariously through him.  Can we run tape on Scott and Todd?  Oh, please.  After we do Weez, we'll do Scott and Todd.  E-Rock is not saying one thing you like about the show.  E-Rock, what did you like about him?  Come on.  I'll bite you.  One thing that you went, wow, yeah, that's it. 
[00:25:00]  Come on.  All right.  On Fridays, they used to do the big transition.  It's the weekend kind of deal.  Oh, you liked that.  You liked when they used to...  And then they would flush the format where they would play stuff that PLJ didn't used  to play.  Isn't that what they do now?  And they'd play that song.  They'd go...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  And Eric was just going like, it's insanity.  I love it.  I love it.  This is crazy.  I love this.  They're flushing the format.  The weekend's coming up.  Chaos has taken over the studio.  Fantastic.  No rules.  The rule book out the window.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to say happy weekend to E-Roc, who's listening right now.  E-Roc.  They'd play this after his phone scams.  What is this?  Phone scams.  It was from some Ocean Spray commercial. 
[00:26:00]  And they just thought that this was one of the greatest beds ever.  So they would play this after every phone scam.  It's terrible.  That's a good stinger.  How annoying.  That's a great pussy-eating sound.  Is that what it is?  I'm going to hear it.  Howl.  Howl.  That's fat niggle kiss.  All right.  I like this niggle kiss.  He just laughs a long job.  I got to hear Scott's hot dog.  Pretty cool, huh? 
[00:26:30]  He's got a boat out there.  He's got a boat he took to high school, I hear, from what I hear.  Born and bred in Florida.  He's got a match for this kid.  He works hard.  He's got a match.  He won a lottery.  Fat rich Florida boy.  Yeah, sir.  He apparently tweets people they shouldn't, but...  It'll never go away, niggle.  Every time he thinks.  Every time he thinks it's over.  It's never over. 
[00:27:00]  Sends out spam links on Twitter.  Send out the spam links to Greg Ophiugh.  We ought to give him a Twitter prank show.  All kinds of great Twitter jokes.  Why does he talk like that?  Is he trying to keep his teeth in his mouth?  Yeah.  Why does he talk like that?  He's preparing for the stroke.  Huh?  He's just like waiting for it.  He had dental work and maybe some facelifts.  Oh, shit.  And it made everything a little too tight?  Uh, yeah.  Did he have a neck lift and that fucked up his vocal cords? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  See, you can't do this shit.  He used to be a really heavy...  Oh, I will never do it.  I won't.  I'll go with the follicles, never with the fucking face.  And then when he stopped, he got all that work done.  Yeah.  All right.  I want to look young.  It's a young show.  Young Iraq.  Fat kid.  Those are jokes.  And that's really funny.  Yeah.  He comes in last.  Why would he do that?  It's all my little size. 
[00:28:00]  Why would he pull his fucking face back like that?  He's an idiot.  Like, why would you do that?  He's a fathead.  Because nobody knows his real age.  How old do you think he is?  He's blocked everything that would prevent...  Is he 60?  What?  He blocks?  He's almost...  Oh, God!  He's got to be 70 at this point.  Look at his chin!  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck!  For me?  Oh, Jimmy.  No, you don't have a chin.  That's fucked up.  Wow, that is fucked up.  Why is that old dimple?  He looks like one of those 80s puppets of him. 
[00:28:30]  You know, remember the one with Reagan and Thatcher in the video for Genesis?  That's a puppet version of him.  Wow.  Why is his fucking chin so big?  What happened?  Wow.  He didn't have a chin like that.  Team America version of Scott.  Yeah, yes!  Did he have a chin implant?  I don't know.  They goof on Leno about his chin.  That's so much worse than Leno.  Can we see more pictures of him?  How?  He's all I want to look at right now.  He's terrible.  I'll find some old photos of him.  Yeah.  Oh, before he was like that? 
[00:29:00]  Wow, that's bad.  Wow.  Why would you do that?  Oh.  Oh, what the fuck?  Wow.  Oh, now it's starting to fall.  It's falling.  He has face erosion.  It's falling.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  At least he looks older there, though.  That's a giant head.  He's got a giant head.  It's a huge head.  And it's square.  He's a block head.  And also, the neck is, like, older.  Yeah, he's got that fucking chicken turkey thing.  How old is he, Iraq?  How old is he? 
[00:29:30]  He's got to be 70.  No way!  Yeah.  Look on Wikipedia.  Come on.  He's not 70.  It's not accurate.  He's blocked so many things.  I would want him to be 70, but I don't think he's 70.  I think if he's not 70, he's got to be 60.  No, no, no.  He's over that.  Maybe 65.  I think he's over 60?  Maybe 65.  What's it say?  It says he was born in 47.  I don't think that's...  53.  That's 65.  Two years after Hitler.  That's 65.  That might be accurate.  That could be.  I would say 65. 
[00:30:00]  Look, he doesn't look 70.  Come on.  Let's be real.  Did you think of 47?  Who was he with there?  That was Adam Curry from MTV.  Oh.  He's now a billionaire, basically.  Well, what a head of hair on Scott, though, right?  But didn't Adam Curry do the internet thing nice and early?  He invented podcasting.  No, he didn't.  Did he really?  Back in the 90s.  How do you invent radio?  You don't invent podcasting.  Radio was already invented.  You plug something in and it's done.  Oh, yeah.  He's credited as the inventor of the podcast.  Stop it.  But that's radio.  Yeah, but it's not on the iPod. 
[00:30:30]  What?  You guys were like, oh, let's be on the radio.  That's what I was.  He also owned MTV.com before MTV got on the internet and sold it back to them.  Wow.  That's brilliant.  What a brilliant man.  But that's why he's never invited to any anniversary thing or any specials.  Fuck them inviting.  That's great.  When that first came out, he bought everything that had MTV's name on it before you could  legally trademark it and everything for the internet.  And they were probably like, who cares?  This is a fad.  And then they went, well, we need MTV.com.  And he goes, I'll sell it to you.  And then there was a big lawsuit. 
[00:31:00]  Was he still with him or no?  What do you mean there was a lawsuit?  They tried suing him for it.  How much did he get out of it?  I don't know, but he made a ton of money.  He had to have made a shitload.  MTV.com had to be worth a million dollars.  MTV.com?  Right?  Sounds like he pulled the old Steve C on him.  Whoa!  Yes!  Opie and Anthony, what?  Hello.  Mine.  Fuck yourself, kids.  I've watermarked it.  I've watermarked everything.  Watermarked it.  Oh, boy. 
[00:31:30]  He's there with Mickey Dolenz.  Mickey Dolenz looks younger than Scott Shannon.  Which one is Scott?  That's an emaciated Scott.  Yeah, well, he's trying to look.  Went to a lot of phases.  And he's looking like a model there, huh?  Yeah, he's trying to do that stuff.  That's him.  He looks really skinny.  Is that older or a newer picture?  He's putting his hand up like Gervais did when he was taking the picture on the table.  We need a photograph.  How old is that picture, Sam? 
[00:32:00]  I'm not sure there's no data.  That's he's 72.  No.  He's 65.  I would go with 65.  Oh, here we go.  What happened?  Play the video first.  Wow, Tom Snyder.  Wow!  Mr. Scott Shannon, who appears each morning on the Z100 WHTZ radio over here in New York.  Z100, a hot new station that went on the air with these call letters last summer.  And since then has gone from one of the lowest-rated radio stations in town to the number one position.  There you go, Scott.  That's a massive shot. 
[00:32:30]  Scott, welcome to the program.  Give me a little bit of history here.  This used to be WVMJ.  Scott looks like E-Rock there.  Looks like E-Rock with a go-team.  Basically a New Jersey-based jazz station with a very small list of ship.  He does look like E-Rock.  Come on.  He does.  But it served those people very, very well.  And we bought the station.  Malwright Communications out of Cleveland got the station.  So you're a part owner of the station, huh?  No, no.  This guy's outrageous.  He's crazy.  I had a lot of fun.  Okay.  Was he doing heroin back then?  What was the secret in your mind of the series of events that took this relatively small radio station 
[00:33:00]  and propelled to the number one radio station in town?  Tom, there are a lot of different factors involved.  Is he dead?  Number one, the staff that we brought in was on the people.  What a terrible set that is.  It's just plants and a brown wall.  It's awful.  Tom Snyder had the worst set.  It's fucking paneling.  I think Tom Snyder's dead, right?  Yeah, Tom is dead.  Tom's gone.  Well, thank you, sir.  You used to do an all right interview, right?  Tom Snyder was the go-to guy late night.  Yeah.  It was after Carson, I think. 
[00:33:30]  After Johnny Carson, Tom Snyder came on.  There's a very famous Kiss interview, which is when Ace Freely melts.  It's just like he's obviously fucking loaded.  Yeah.  Figures.  And he's just fucking laughing, and Paul and Gene are so fucking irritated with him.  They're so mad.  He's tainting the product.  We've got to see that now.  Because why would you have a rock star that's loaded and having fun when a business douchebag 
[00:34:00]  like fucking Gene?  Wait till you see Ace start laughing and fucking, oh, he gets so irritated.  But what?  That's a rock star.  Of course he's loaded and having fun.  Actually, sometimes it was, we worked on a chain drive, the first levitating drum set  that we had.  The bicycle chain.  And sometimes it would skip.  Gotcha.  Have you ever had a 10-speed bicycle?  Surely.  It would go up like the other.  And then you'd run a drum and go up like the other.  And then you'd run a drum and go up like the other.  And then you'd run a drum and go up like the other.  And my heart would drop with it.  And we, you know, we all felt...  Look at Gene!  We played along with it, though, you know? 
[00:34:30]  In fact, the first time...  That's part of the show.  You can never let on.  I'm glad you guys did.  When we first started playing...  Oh, it's Gene pissed.  ...wearing these kind of shoes.  And Ace, Ace is notorious for his bad balance.  Get blood poisoning from your makeup, you cunt.  Jesus.  Hey, Gene.  A couple of months that we were on tour, invariably, once a night, you would hear a thud on stage  and you would look, and Ace would be sprawled up.  And being troopers, we would run over and play over.  These guys were incredible.  If I were four on stage, these guys would run over to me and make believe like it was part 
[00:35:00]  of the show.  They'd stand over me and we'd do like this.  How great is Ace?  We're looking down, we put the guitars together.  Just regular guy.  There goes the lead guitars.  Hey, that last part of the show.  And look at Gene.  You're fucking curmudgeon.  What goes through your mind?  You gotta zip through it a little bit.  You have time to think about audience reaction while you're profaned.  I feel like I'm in a movie.  I always get to feel...  Look how mad he is.  I'm a trap player.  See, you guys don't know the lines. 
[00:35:30]  Wake up.  Wake up.  Okay.  What's wrong?  Hello, Australia.  This is Gene Simmons of Kiss and I'd like to introduce you to...  Paul Stanley of Kiss who wants to introduce you to Ace Bailey of Kiss.  What's the name of the new drummer?  All right.  I think his name is...  Oh, wait a minute.  I remember.  I remember.  Gene's pissed.  His name is Erica and he's incredible.  Okay.  Like, get out of here.  I just cry. 
[00:36:00]  You know why I spent all that money?  Oh, man.  I think pissed at him.  He's loaded.  Because he's stealing the interview.  Yes.  Look at Gene.  He goes up to the air.  Gene's pissed.  Damn it, Fudge.  Fuck Gene Simmons.  He's loaded.  He's zooted.  He was so fucked up he should have been on planet zooted or something. 
[00:36:30]  That would be the funniest moments of Ace Freely on YouTube.  Definitely worth checking out.  Ace coming in?  I heard he might come in today.  I'm hoping so.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ooh.  For our show or later on when...  Today.  Yeah.  Like for here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  I thought maybe like after 10 where...  I hope so.  Where, you know, you'd go over...  Hi, Ace.  Or Sam's show.  I just want to say that.  Hi, Ace.  You're picturing him in that chair?  Yeah.  You wouldn't want him to sit next to you?  I'd prefer... 
[00:37:00]  Hey, we got an Adam Curry update.  Oh, good.  We've all heard for a long time that he's a very rich man.  According to Dirk in the Netherlands, Adam Curry lost a lot, if not all of his money, a few years ago.  Got divorced.  Moved back to the U.S.  He used to live in a castle in Belgium.  That's how rich this guy was.  How did he lose it?  Maybe the divorce?  How much are Belgian castles?  Yeah.  Really?  They might have to lose shit.  Maybe $2,000, $3,000.  Those fucking castles don't hold their value.  Yeah, not at all. 
[00:37:30]  Fuck.  Norton on Imus.  That just happened.  What was that?  Well, we got it here.  I don't know.  Let's see.  And quickly, boss, Jim Norton.  He was on a plane.  He recently did a stand-up special on cable.  Anyway, he talked about this experience he had on a plane.  Take a listen.  I was in L.A. recently.  I had the weirdest.  It was actually on the way home from that Aussie shoot.  The weirdest celebrity sighting on the plane.  Sitting in front of me, Al Sharpton.  Was on the plane directly in front.  And it was so weird to root for my own flight to crash. 
[00:38:00]  Come on.  Talk about mixed emotions as the plane is going down.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yay!  Fatso!  That's so funny, dude.  All right.  Jim Norton from Opie and Anthony.  33 after the hour.  That's a funny idea, isn't it?  Yeah.  That's very funny.  I only wish he would do that when he came on the show. 
[00:38:30]  Ever seen one program?  Well, you know what?  August of the morning.  Hold on.  That was great.  Hold on, man.  We got to say something here.  That was good.  That's pretty brave of Ibis.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't really take shots at Sharpton.  Whether he's doing the shots or letting someone else take the shots.  I would love to have done that on a show.  I just didn't know if I could do that when I was on his show.  Right, right, right.  I just didn't know what his...  You know, it's like when someone comes back, I don't know how he handles stuff like that  anymore.  Yeah.  That's pretty brave.  Yeah.  I think that's the first time I've heard him, you know...  You know what I'm thinking?  Take a shot at Sharpton through someone else. 
[00:39:00]  That might be a...  I heard what Jim Norton had said on the show, you know, getting a little pissed off at me  for, you know, saying that maybe we should play something that's really funny from Jim  Norton.  I think he's...  That was almost an apology.  Maybe.  I don't know.  He thought it was Bernie.  I don't know.  Maybe Bernie figured...  Yeah.  I mean, look...  Bernie's the man.  I'm good with Ibis.  Bernie's good.  I'm on Red Eye tonight, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Yes!  I couldn't do it.  No, I'm just kidding. 
[00:39:30]  No, I was not supposed to.  Were you supposed to be on...  Last night?  No, they asked me for...  I think later in the week, like Thursday or Friday.  They asked me last night!  I couldn't make it.  Really?  Yeah.  Last night was supposed to be kind of a weaker show, though.  I think Voss was on last night, because I read on Twitter...  Was it?  Okay.  It wasn't a weaker show.  No, they said Voss was, like, dropping knowledge on Red Eye.  They said, stop looking at your notes, too.  Put my eggs there!  Was he?  Thank you, yeah.  Oh, was he looking at notes?  I don't know.  He's coming in tomorrow.  I'm on tonight, though.  I'll ask him.  Watch your Red Eye.  According to public records, Scott Shannon is either 64 or 67. 
[00:40:00]  That's a pretty big fucking gap.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  I still kind of want to know what was the bit that E-Rock was...  He liked when they flushed the format.  Was that it?  What did flush the format mean?  They went from pop music to what?  Pretty much the same songs that Scott thinks from, you know, 70s and 80s that were still popular.  So they just played old schools?  Like what? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, they played...  Well, he thought, like, edgy stuff was, like, the Ramones, I Want to Be Sedated.  But then he would go into songs like that Jump in the Line from Beetlejuice.  Jump in the line...  Oh, God, what a faggot you are.  And Eric was just like, no rules!  It's Friday!  Where's the beer sound effect?  Oh, oh...  Can't play that well, but you can't play it.  Flush the format. 
[00:41:00]  Shake, shake, shake, see you all right?  And this made you, like, feel good?  You liked this, didn't you?  I did, at the time.  I did.  And then it would go into songs like this.  Oh, goodness sake.  Oh.  I got the hippie, hippie shake.  Oh, you're awful.  You like this fucking getting ready for the weekend jazz?  Yeah, it's a weekend!  Because Eric's a man of leisure.  And even back then, he liked to know leisure time was coming.  I just picture Iran at the controls of the boat, pushing that throttle forward. 
[00:41:30]  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah, Florida boy!  Going to high school.  Yeah, I think Eric went home and concentrated on his studies.  No, he's a boy who loved leisure and treats on the weekends.  Did they do work for the weekend?  No, I don't think they did that.  No, that was hack?  No, because that was the 5 o'clock whistle on G100.  Ugh.  The 5 o'clock whistle?  I'm disgusted.  Why did I ever get into this boozle? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, what is the 5 o'clock whistle?  I was bamboozled.  Horrible!  I was bamboozled under the guise that it was all fun and games.  And then I realized what assholes run this shit.  Now you're just boozled.  Do they let the lobster loose, too?  Yeah!  Remember that?  He rocked?  No, that was another G100.  That clip?  That was the G100 thing?  Yeah.  No, that was Snortin' Larry Norton.  Oh, and he played that.  That was Steve Martin? 
[00:42:30]  97 Rock.  Right.  But every morning's youth show format would do that on Fridays.  They'd play that clip.  But they would tease it for three hours, and then it was just a long sound clip.  Horrid.  What about, also, what about the awful brew?  We've been streaming in the back.  They haven't played any of the sound effects yet.  Yeah, because Wheeze is on.  He's going to talk through most of that horse shit.  They're in 12 minutes of commercials right now, so.  What do they play going into commercials? 
[00:43:00]  The radio sucks.  They just played a station ID or something and went right in.  It wasn't anything worth bringing in yet.  Did they do the brew thing?  No.  It just said the brew, but they didn't play any.  The brew.  Who's the hole, Sam?  I don't remember.  They got a hole.  E-Rock.  Who's the hole?  I don't know.  They've been through three different holes now.  Oh, really?  Heather O'Rourke?  The one before this was Patty Steele.  Heather O'Rourke, that's the girl from Poltergeist.  Is it really?  Heather O'Rourke.  But she's dead.  What happened?  Poor kid.  She died of some intestinal thing. 
[00:43:30]  Did she really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a cursed movie.  And then the other girl died from some fucking stalker.  Shot her in the face or some shit, right?  Wow.  The older sister?  There was the older sister that at the beginning of Poltergeist, she just went, ah, and like  ran off to her boyfriend or something, and she wound up like a stalker.  Was she in most of the movie or no?  Killed her.  She was the daughter of the guy from fucking, ah, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig,  gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, gig. 
[00:44:00]  The author.  The author.  He just recently died.  Come on.  Come on, pal.  Don't kill me.  A fucking writer.  Help me out.  Famous writer.  Help me out.  Come on.  Who's going to do it?  Sam?  Oh, you people are worthless.  The famous writer.  Who is she?  You're all worthless and weak.  I got famous writer, at least.  No, it's not Stephen King.  It's a famous writer.  No, it's not.  I'm wondering, is she the one, I'll know the name if I hear it, of the guy who, there's  a famous one, the guy, he knocked on her door and then shot her?  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's the other one.  Dominic Dunn!  Dominic Dunn.  It's Dominic Dunn, and it was Dominique Dunn, was the daughter, and a stalker fucking killed 
[00:44:30]  her.  Killed her!  Was this before he did what he did?  What do you mean?  He's like a crime investigator, isn't he?  Yeah, but he's dead now.  But what, was he doing that back then?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was an author, but then he got really into the whole murder thing.  Early life, murder, oh my God, I hate stalkers.  Don't you fucking hate them?  Hate with a vengeance.  It was a bad one, too.  He was a fucking nasty one.  In 82, after completing work on Poltergeist, she met and moved in with this guy, a chef 
[00:45:00]  named John Sweeney.  A saucier!  Oh.  No.  Oh, he's...  It was an abusive relationship, and then she ended it.  It's a few weeks later, when she refused to reconcile with him.  They argued in the driveway.  She was rehearsing for the miniseries V with actor David Packer.  He dragged her into the backyard of the house next door and strangled her until she was unconscious.  She was braindead after being in a coma for five days.  Jesus.  Wow. 
[00:45:30]  She was in Hill Street Blues.  But they found him guilty of a lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter instead of...  Why?  Six and a half years.  He served less than four years before this piece of shit murders his ex-girls.  How is that possible?  Because they're probably looking at it like it was an act of passion and not a premeditated  man.  It wasn't...  Yeah, they said it wasn't premeditated.  He came to the house.  He talked...  He was talking to her outside in one of the alleyways.  Right.  And then started, like, fucking beating her. 
[00:46:00]  Guys get more for weed.  I know.  It's crazy.  What the fuck is wrong with us?  His name is John Mora.  He changed his name.  He's...  One thing, though, he's a...  Where's he now?  He's an outcast in Hollywood.  Like, anywhere he goes, people fucking...  But it's not enough.  Oh, duh.  I mean, yeah, yeah.  But he should be in prison.  He should be in Hollywood and you can take care of that.  What was he?  He was an actor?  Yeah, but nothing.  Oh, he was a chef.  He was like nothing.  Yeah, he was a chef.  He was trying to make it, right?  Then there's that other chick.  What was that one from the Mork and Mindy show there? 
[00:46:30]  Pam Dauber was the lead.  My sister Sam.  No, my sister Sam.  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  I'm good.  And it was the chick from that wound up getting fucking shot.  Some guy just walked up to the door.  What's her name?  Knocked on the door and shot her.  Rebecca Schaefer.  Yes.  God, I hate stalkers.  Just walked up and he talked about it.  It was the most chilling fucking interview.  He talked about it and said...  And he was all fucked up.  He's like, and I walked up to the door and she opened it and I shot her. 
[00:47:00]  And then he goes and she went...  Like, he made the sound she made.  And it was fucking horrific.  You wanted to fucking choke him.  Where is this?  Where is this interview?  I don't know.  I remember seeing it though.  I remember seeing that too.  I was horrified watching it.  I saw BTK interviewed recently.  The BTK killer.  That's the E-Rox killer.  Oh, that's the BK.  Oh, I forgot.  It was the BK.  We talked about it.  Dennis Rader from Kansas.  And just watching him talk about it.  It's like we literally should squash this cunt like an insect.  He talks about it like he's proud of it. 
[00:47:30]  He should just literally be fucking buried alive.  Yeah.  What a fucking piece of shit.  Oh.  Hey, good morning to you, everybody.  Good morning.  We're talking about murders.  Good morning.  Talking about murders, everyone.  Good morning.  Ugh.  Bastards.  He's dead?  Who?  That guy?  Oh, no.  No, her.  She had such a big career in front of her.  But where is that guy?  With her big 80s hair.  They know where that guy is.  That guy?  And what is he doing?  Is he in jail?  He's got to still be in jail, right?  The Rebecca Schaefer one? 
[00:48:00]  Come on.  What up?  July 27, 2007.  What happened?  He was stabbed 11 times on his way to breakfast.  Oh, good.  In jail.  Great.  Did he die?  No, he didn't die.  He's kind of an asshole stabs him.  What, did he stab him?  The shoulder?  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, no, he's just still in jail.  What happened?  Two inmates, what?  Oh, two weapons?  Yeah, they've got no...  Man.  I mean, they figured out who did it.  So they killed him.  They stabbed 11 times.  Good.  Still alive.  That's your life, scumbag.  He's 42. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, well, he looks good.  Good fuckwad.  He's a good head of hair, too, for Christ's sake.  Yeah, he really does.  What a waste in prison.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucking tragic.  Stalkers are the worst.  I fucking...  Right!  Such a hatred of them.  Yes.  And those protection orders do no good.  No, they don't.  It's like this guy that stalked poor Trump's daughter.  Like, it's just enraging what I read about that a woman has to deal with this.  As a guy, I've dealt with a couple of these fucking psychotic cunts.  Anthony, you're never going to find anybody better than me. 
[00:49:00]  I really think, you know, if you feel that you want somebody that's going to be good  for you, he'll call me.  She might be right, though.  Shut up!  She might be right.  Cunt!  She might be right.  Cunt!  You're fucking cunt!  Oh, God.  I have such a fucking...  Not for her.  Because they're neat.  But I've had a couple of them.  Yeah.  And they just won't stop.  No.  It's like, will you go fuck yourself? 
[00:49:30]  Not for ready.  You weirdo, you creep.  Thank you.  Fucking clingy cancer cell.  Beat it.  Clingy cancer cell.  You fucking sarcoma.  Go away!  Go away!  Ugh!  Me!  Me!  Acknowledge me!  Wow, they put a young kumi on your now body.  Oh, look at my little face.  I was such a cute little kid.  Sure you were.  But I had no confidence back then.  I could have gotten the chicks.  Wow, look at that, though. 
[00:50:00]  It matches up pretty good.  It really does.  That's my young face on my young body.  Your body's not aging?  No, I got those...  Look at that.  I got the little, like, neck muscle things.  I see that.  That's my trainer, but I can't train my face.  I can't train my face.  No.  It would be nice if I could go,  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Supposedly you can.  I can't exercise my face.  Supposedly you can.  Eh.  I don't believe in myself.  I'm a muscular motherfucker, though.  I'll say.  I can't do the face thing.  I don't know.  I do face exercises.  Do you go? 
[00:50:30]  No.  One and two and three and four.  I just opened my mouth wide.  Who's that?  Who is that bitch?  That's Cooper Lawrence.  The hole from...  How old is she?  She's cute.  I don't like her side picture, but she's...  Cooper Lawrence is not her real name.  You don't think so?  That's a radio name.  Whoa.  Cooper Lawrence with you.  When are we going to get Scott and Todd audio?  Patricia McCann.  Patricia McCann.  I haven't heard her in a while.  I heard that recently. 
[00:51:00]  It was terrible.  Anytime you need to have something that will warm you in the evening, why not have a cup  of tea?  Patricia McCann.  Why just throw your name in the mouth?  I hate Patricia McCann.  What does she do?  Nothing.  Commercials are on 1010 Winds all the time.  I crack up now every time I hear her.  I haven't heard them in a while.  What does she do before that?  Is she a personality or...  Patricia McCann?  She's probably a voiceover broad.  Goodyear Tires.  And figured out somewhere, if I add my name, maybe I could get a few more...  That people know her. 
[00:51:30]  A few extra bucks for her.  Goodyear Tires.  They hold up under every single Patricia McCann.  Almost like you're putting your seal on it, so it must be good.  Yeah.  Oh, she's fucking terrible.  Oh, man, does she look like a fucking alien?  She's hair like Grover from Sesame Street.  She looks like a burn victim, actually.  Wow.  This is her job, though.  New hair.  She is the personality commercial spokesperson for 1010 Winds.  She has endorsed product on the station since 1992.  1992.  Wow.  Patricia McCann. 
[00:52:00]  Her name, her website should be Neck McGillicuddy.  She really does have a huge neck.  Holy shit.  It's as wide as her head.  Yeah.  Enough of her.  She fucking powerless with her skull on weekends.  She enters strong, strong thing competitions because she has an abnormally large clitoris  for a spoke person.  Patricia McCann.  Patricia McCann.  It looks like a PES dispenser, actually.  She is.  What a terrible head.  Horrible.  All right.  We go to break with this weighing of the tit thing that Danny did.  Oh. 
[00:52:30]  I heard about this.  Can Danny do a video like Sam?  Can he sync up that stuff?  What happened?  Of course.  What's going on with the video?  What video?  What are we trying to do?  Sam doesn't have time to do it because we're leaving.  What?  A video from the UFC trip?  Yeah.  We are leaving.  Not the chip stuff because I videoed everything.  Right.  It's not the chip stuff.  So you got interviews with guys.  Yeah.  Just to put up.  The special was awesome.  Right.  But we videoed Bob and Jim interviewing everyone.  Mm.  So there's no fork with this.  All right.  What?  Let's go fork yourself. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, man.  Long time.  How's everything?  Pretty sweet, actually.  How's Jim?  Ah, we're done.  It's over.  I got a new chick now.  Want to see a pic?  Sure.  Fat titties, right?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  Nice.  Fucking three and a half pounds apiece.  Bam!  You know the exact weight of your girlfriend's breasts?  You don't?  Come on.  I'll show you.  Han?  Hey, babe.  Sweetie, get a bowl and fill it to the top with water.  But I don't think they've gotten any big...  Just get it! 
[00:53:30]  What's going on?  Here you go.  Hey, man.  Do me a favor.  Go weigh this baking tray and write down the weight.  Okay.  Uh, half a pound?  Okay.  Babe, put a bowl of water in the baking tray and drown them titties like Rodney King.  Great job, honey.  Now you see how the water is overflowing out of the bowl and being collected in the tray?  Now we'll need to measure the displaced water that's in the tray.  Because tissue is less dense than water,  we'll need to multiply that number by 0.9 to compensate.  And don't forget to subtract the weight of the tray. 
[00:54:00]  So let's see here.  Times 0.9 and...  Bingo!  Three and a half pounds.  And that's legit?  Legit!  So, I assume you know how to weigh a giant cock.  Boy, do I!  Let me show you.  Who the hell saw that coming?  I did!  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel, channel, channel, channel, channel.  On Sirius XM.  News of the world.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony show.  And had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all.  He was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him.  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald!  Donald!  Before you leave us, tell us, please. 
[00:55:00]  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver screen studs and starlets.  On Opie and Anthony.  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[00:55:30]  No!  It's fucking distracting.  Fuck!  I want you off the fucking set, you prick!  What don't you fucking understand?  Let's go again!  Oh, good for you! 
[00:56:00]  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  So be it!  Threaten no more!  To secure pieces!  To prepare for war!  So be it!  Sounds good!  Ah, good morning everyone!  Love this song!  Oh yeah! 
[00:56:30]  Yeah!  Don't tread our ma!  Why, uh, the don't tread our ma!  Yeah!  You rock!  Hello!  Good morning!  Oh, oh, what?  His bit just fucking went to nothing.  I know.  His bit fucking melted.  I didn't feel like playing the sweeper.  Why this song?  Uh, back on this day in 2000, Lars took the stand to testify against Napster.  Wow.  Remember that?  Really?  Remember that?  The Scott and Todd bit.  Ah, they might have been onto something back then, though. 
[00:57:00]  Now we're all getting music for free.  No?  It's a bit.  What?  That's a...  It's a bit.  What?  It's E-Roc's bit.  E-Roc's bit.  It's...  Sam put up a literal horse's bit that you put in his mouth to fucking steer him.  Ha ha!  Sam!  You're a prick.  I'm just kidding.  I don't think you're a horse.  Of course you're kidding.  Every time you're kidding.  Every day.  Every hour of the show.  All of it.  You goof on, E-Roc. 
[00:57:30]  You're just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Hey.  I'm just playing.  Meh.  How'd that Napster thing work out, E-Roc?  What happened with the Napster?  What happened?  Not good.  It's huge.  Not good, huh?  No, not good.  No one uses Napster.  It was the hugest thing ever.  Once all this started, you couldn't even sell it anymore.  Done.  Someone just bought the name, re-bid it as a licensed music download, and iTunes was already  out, so who gave it to it?  What do you use as far as music goes? 
[00:58:00]  I just steal it.  Do you steal it?  Yeah.  Who buys music?  No, no.  I don't mean buying music.  How'd you find a picture of a fat horse?  That's a big fat fucking horse.  Wow.  I've never seen a picture of a fat horse before.  That's got to be Photoshopped.  It has to be.  I think it is.  That horse is too fat.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, thank God.  Just streaming music, though.  Like, what do you use?  Like, as far as radio goes, or Sonos, or something like that? 
[00:58:30]  I don't have a SiriusXM unit at this point.  Oh.  I go with Pandora.  I use Pandora at my house.  Oh, boy.  That's the competition.  Why don't you use SiriusXM?  I do sometimes.  I go to, like, either it's only lithium or 80s.  I've been to your house for a compound party.  XMU is what I heard.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Although it may have been ladies' selection.  Yeah, probably.  Crazy Canadians, right?  No, it was a certain model.  Oh!  It was that era. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, Frau Steading.  It was the XMU era?  Yes, yes.  I hate that fucking station.  Hate it.  I don't have SiriusXM in my house, and I'll tell you why.  Because they shut off my units probably every other week.  Why didn't you just call?  And I finally gave up and said, you know what?  If you can't figure out that I work here and you can just leave my units on, then I can't be bothered.  Hello, Mr. Hughes.  My name is Don.  I want to be helping noise.  No.  They shut off my units. 
[00:59:30]  What is it?  Once a year?  Once every six months?  Once every three months?  And I finally gave up.  I finally gave up.  I'm like, I don't feel like giving my numbers to the company every few months so they could keep my units on.  Terrible.  So I don't have it.  I listen to the TV.  Hey, the TV has music channels.  They really do have good music channels.  Well, big selection.  Very terrific.  And on Fios, they do.  And it's right there on your TV.  It goes right through your sound system.  It's nice.  And I don't have our show on in our car. 
[01:00:00]  No?  Those I have.  I have it in the car.  It's actually pretty easy to do.  I need that, too.  I don't have our show.  Driving home, I cannot drive without the after show.  I can't monitor our own show.  I didn't get the best of XM because I got a Sirius unit.  Talk about me.  Just call it.  I'll put it on the thing for you.  That's the key.  Yeah.  You don't want to hear it.  No.  The only reason I would get it is for us.  But I don't listen to the show when I'm out here.  I take a break.  You don't listen to the after show?  The Sam Roberts after show?  When Kenny has it on in the car, it's actually quite enjoyable.  Thank you.  Really?  I'm not going to be that guy. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  It's quite enjoyable.  Yuck.  It's easy to just trash it, but it's quite enjoyable.  It is easy to trash it.  It's very hard to find anything redeeming about it.  That is the trick.  Find something good about Sam's show.  It's a contest we're having.  Quite enjoyable, Sam.  I think so, too.  Thank you very much.  It was very odd to hear Joe Rogan praising you.  You heard that, right?  I did hear that at dinner.  Right.  It's like, you do the after show.  Man, I like that.  I listen.  Joe knows.  And I was like, fuck, man.  You know, Joe Rogan has, I said it on the after show, Joe Rogan has praised the after 
[01:01:00]  show more than anybody who works here.  Look, we all know he's a stoned goof.  Exactly.  Joe's just hiding.  Whatever.  He's just fucked up all the time.  He knows good content.  And has a tough time praising anything.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Kind of do.  Do you like anything?  Besides guns and racism.  Hate.  I'll give you those two.  But besides that.  I laugh.  Wait, because it's true.  Alice in Chains, you like?  I like Alice in Chains.  And younger girls, you like?  Yes, yes.  Well, you know, still legal, mind you. 
[01:01:30]  I said younger girls.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you say guns and racism?  Guns and racism.  Good television shows?  I love good television.  Not easy to get a compliment from Mr. Kumia.  What?  Never.  Really?  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Hey, it has to be earned.  What?  Jesus.  I know.  Sam hasn't done it yet.  I'm working on it.  You get anything done down the hall there, Jimmy?  What happened down there?  Well.  Oh, banana mouth.  I have a mouthful of banana and cottage cheese. 
[01:02:00]  Cottage cheese.  I'm enjoying my breakfast.  You really are.  It does make that sound.  I went and talked to Steve Blatter.  Oh, yes.  And he said that he's going to look into it with the team here.  I'm like, it's got to be up soon.  Again, none of these are earth shattering, but they're just things that MMA sites would pick up and maybe do it.  It's just more.  It's like if we've done them, it's better for the show if they're out there than if they're not out there. 
[01:02:30]  We got guys that oversee this channel that just suck.  You know, I make fun about it, but we really need someone that could be on top of shit.  Yeah.  You know, they just suck.  And it's the same problems over and over again that never get solved.  The latest problem is really simple.  You know, we have video that we need to edit and we want to put up on sites.  We can't edit videos here at SiriusXM for some reason.  Why can't we do that?  And we've been telling these guys for, I honestly don't know. 
[01:03:00]  It has to be years at this point.  Dude, there's free programs that could do it.  It has to be years at this point.  Fuck.  And these dopes that oversee the channel, that's why I beat the shit out of them,  because they're useless to us.  They're completely useless.  Why does Jimmy have to go down the hall and bring up the exact same problem that we did a year ago  and two years ago and three years ago?  Is it true that we can't just take video that you got from the UFC?  This is the latest one, right?  Yeah.  You and Jimmy fucking got a lot of video from the UFC.  And it's not a quick edit, because I have to sync audio from our voice recorder. 
[01:03:30]  But these guys aren't even aware that you might have video.  They don't even ask you about it.  And they don't even say, well, what are we going to do with the video?  How do we capitalize on that?  I don't know whether or not they even heard the special.  I've heard Rob complimented the special, and beyond that, nobody's mentioned anything about the UFC.  But he's an intern.  What about the other guys that work here?  He's not an intern technically, but yeah, no.  Nobody is.  So Jimmy marched down the hall to discuss the exact same issue that we have discussed.  That's why I just, when Jimmy looks at me, I just laugh, because I'm like, well, I don't know what else to do. 
[01:04:00]  We've told these guys the problems.  We're flying today, so Sam can't do it.  And Danny's computer at home, I guess, can't handle the input of the video.  Maybe he might have a, I guess you need a certain amount of whatever.  But the fact is, if these guys are in touch with anything, you know, the UFC is really hot.  You guys got some video interviews with some huge stars of the UFC.  So that would be very good for our channel.  Because other sites would pick up video interviews in a second.  They don't like picking up audio interviews for the most part. 
[01:04:30]  How easy it is to edit it.  It's not like you're putting together a movie.  But why are we even discussing it?  Because nothing will change.  They will discuss it with the team.  Know how many times I've heard, we'll discuss it with the team?  That's why I don't do meetings with these guys.  It's a complete waste of time.  Nothing changes.  How do we don't have a capability to edit shit?  It's incomprehensible that we don't.  What's that about, Sam?  Because then the, well, I've heard two things.  I told them that I only edit on Macs because that's all I know how to do. 
[01:05:00]  And the computers that we have in the office cannot, you can't put just a video editing program  on the computers we have in the office and expect it.  Oh, why?  Well, because it's probably something that you can't put programs on.  I mean, because if they put a video editing program, the computer just couldn't, the computer  can barely handle a web browser as it is.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, like, nothing would ever get done.  You'd need a good computer.  But why, if we're an important show, because they tell us that, why wouldn't they upgrade  our shit?  I told them. 
[01:05:30]  The rest of these dopes don't need their shit upgraded, but we do.  I priced out a MacBook.  But I'm being honest.  I know it's harsh.  I know it's harsh.  But I'm being honest, like, they tell us we're one of the important shows here, so  upgrade our shit.  I know half these guys don't need their shit upgraded.  That's all I'm saying.  Maybe I can say it nicer.  I have no respect for anyone in this place.  Fuck it.  Yeah, I priced out a MacBook a few months ago, but I don't know.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I sent the information.  Maybe in two years you'll get it.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't care.  But Jimmy marched down the hall to Brandy Dufresne for his books.  That's all you gotta do is just keep writing letters.  But Jimmy marched down the hall to bring up the exact same issue we've brought up so  many times I can't even count.  Can't even count that high.  But the web team is made up of, like, three people in their team.  200 shots.  What's our latest video up there?  Anything good?  Let me check.  I think it's something from NEW.  They're understaffed, the web team. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Warren Sapp.  Warren Sapp.  All right.  That was within the last month, at least.  Andy Samberg, Anthony Bourdain.  What about the Breaking Bad guy?  They didn't...  That's the other thing.  They didn't come in here to film him, so I filmed him.  Okay.  So now they're in a panic trying to figure out how I can either edit it or I can get  that footage to the web team, too.  But does Robert Gary...  Hold on.  Does Robert Gary ever come to you and go, oh my god, Breaking Bad is one of the biggest  shows.  Huge.  It's...  The fifth season starts this weekend. 
[01:07:00]  Holy shit, you had one of the main guys.  If not, he's the main guy, right?  He's the guy.  And you got video.  Did they even come to you and go, wow, we need that video immediately because we got  to get it up on the SiriusXM website?  To be fair, Rob came...  Rob himself came to me yesterday and said, tomorrow we'll figure out how to get the footage  to the web team.  For his personal use?  Yeah.  Just because he wanted to watch it.  Just because he wanted to watch it.  Wanted to check it out.  Couldn't be for the fucking station.  Breaking Bad fans were hovering around all our Twitter accounts and the radio show yesterday  because... 
[01:07:30]  They loved it!  Because this is a massive show and we had the guy on yesterday.  Yes.  That's huge.  Yeah.  He was good, too.  Good talker.  He was really good.  I loved Brian Cranston, right?  Yeah.  There's something online, too, where he does the transformation into Walter White, where he's  sitting, he's doing a talk show, sitting on the chair.  He's got his full head of hair and they shave his head and stick that dumb mustache and  stuff on him during the show.  What do you call that mustache again? 
[01:08:00]  An impotent mustache, which is perfect.  He really was just a dolt, nothing.  An impotent mustache.  Yeah.  An impotent mustache.  He described it perfectly.  But what a smart way...  I'm always interested, these actors...  Yeah.  ...the things they do that I can't do, like the thinking that they have.  That goes behind that.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the clothes, the very bland everything and the mustache and the hair.  Yeah.  Blending in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very interesting. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  So...  He's a great actor, that guy.  He really is, man.  You just think he's the...  Oh, the dad from Malcolm in the Middle.  Right.  Fucking guy's great.  So we'll discuss with the team, Jimmy.  So you're...  The team.  You're in good hands.  So at least give it to the...  You should give it to the...  They're in great hands.  In good hands.  Nothing against our team, by the way.  Oh, no.  Their fucking hands are...  The web team is just overburdened.  Yeah.  We had three really good interviews yesterday, and absolutely, there should be a clip from  all three.  We kind of need a full-time video guy. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, we should.  Of course we do.  For the show.  I thought that was you.  I got...  You got 20 shows and the video, right?  Can Sal do it?  I don't know if Sal can do it or not.  I mean...  Yeah.  Sal's our production guy.  I mean...  But if all these guys oversee the channel, why doesn't one of those guys just step up  and do it?  Who cares?  Yeah, Sam.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Then I would at least know what they do.  Holy shit.  Gary's in here helping us out with an interview.  He's videotaping.  Great.  I'm not going to think less of the guy. 
[01:09:30]  You couldn't think less of the guy.  Of course.  Of course.  Ouch.  My honesty gets me in trouble.  I'm sorry, people.  Hey, watch what you say.  I'll put it on his after show.  Whoa!  Fuck yeah!  I won't.  I'm going to talk about you.  I'm going to talk about that shit.  People love when I call in.  It's the highlight of the whole show and stuff.  They certainly don't.  No.  Kenny phone calls.  Yeah.  Brinko doesn't know how to say goodbye. 
[01:10:00]  No.  Wait, one more question.  Hey, Troy!  I'll tell you when I love when Kenny calls.  Right when I go into the tunnel.  Because I know when I pop out the other end, he's done.  I get to continue.  You have to deal with that.  You're strange.  Why?  Because you hate this show, but you listen more than anyone in the studio.  Yeah.  Anthony.  You know way more about it than myself, and I compliment the kid.  I listen to every minute of it just out of sheer hatred for it. 
[01:10:30]  I can't get enough of hating his show.  Anthony is the most stealthily supportive person you'll ever meet.  Well, what I really like doing, though, by the way, is hoping that I leave late enough where  I get to hear Ron and Fez, and that I could call in and contribute to their program.  Oh, my God.  Because I do like calling the Ron and Fez show and contributing something to their program, as I did the other day.  You know how we make fun of callers? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  We literally did it that day on Friday, I think it was, last Friday on the after show.  Oh, boy.  Because callers were calling in while we were playing best of bits.  And, you know, you make fun of callers for not knowing it's a best of bit.  Yeah.  I walked in here.  No.  Into this studio.  Sam, put me through.  I want to get on the Ron and Fez show.  I walked in here to interview somebody, like a pre-taped interview, because the studio was empty.  No.  And I was like, the hotline's ringing.  What's that?  And so I picked up the phone.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  And I was like, hello?  Like, what took so long to pick up?  I hear, hey, it's Anthony from O&A.  Can you put me through?  I go, Ant, Ant, it's Sam.  Oh, hi, Sam.  Put me through to the Ron and Fez show.  Why the fuck was there one answering the hotline?  I'm just kidding.  Put me through to Ron and Fez.  I want to talk to these guys.  They're making me laugh my balls off.  Oh, God.  Ant, it's a best of show.  I didn't know.  I was the idiot.  I was the over-eager, anxious guy.  You should have put them on hold.  They're in best of.  Oh, man. 
[01:12:00]  You should have fucked with them.  I'd have been so mad.  Why am I on hold so long?  What were they discussing that you needed in?  Well, they were talking about a strange, bizarre, horrible accent.  Ah.  See, I wanted to get through and talk about it.  Yeah, but they talked about that, like, months ago.  Well, I didn't know.  What was the worst accent?  Did they figure that out?  Well, it was a southern thing, I think.  Southern?  It was like a southern American, southern accent.  And I wanted to get through and talk about how awful Australian accents are and how awful the Outback commercial Australian guy is. 
[01:12:30]  Ah.  Who is not Australian.  No.  And I think Australians are probably very angry with this guy.  Get a steak at the Outback.  It's so bad.  I love that guy.  No, he's terrible.  And I kind of wanted to, um...  Can we see that?  Ah.  You could get potatoes and a steak at the air, Bick. 
[01:13:00]  You really hate that accent?  It's terrible.  I don't mind it, actually.  I like an Australian accent.  A thousand miles from the everyday.  This guy's bad.  Every day.  It's a bit more adventurous.  More adventure.  You don't need to catch a plane to get there.  You've just got to think Australian.  Come on into Outback Steakhouse, where our brand new menu is unlike anything you've ever explored.  Explore.  Businesses that have traveled down under two.  Fifteen meals under $15.  Starting at $9.95.  It's not real.  It'll make you happier than a koala up a gum treat. 
[01:13:30]  Live adventurous.  It's terrible.  That stinks.  It stinks.  Ah, that's a commercial.  Here's an Australian accent.  Terrible commercial.  It's a double commercial.  So we went in the boat.  Tried to catch a shark.  Put the line in the water.  Shark came up.  Tried to eat our boat.  We hit him with an ooh.  That's it.  It's got to go up at the end.  Here's a good one.  Or it doesn't fucking work.  Put some shrimp on the vavis.  No.  That's good.  Popped in our car.  Went out. 
[01:14:00]  Tried to hit a wallaby.  Got to find a kangaroo.  Yeah.  A eucalyptus tree.  Fucking humongous.  Tried to steal our fuel.  Had a problem with our car.  Every sentence they do it.  Every single one.  Kangaroos are hopping all over town and stuff.  Radiant is cracked at the core.  Two days ago I saw rig that a lot of tanker.  Right?  Yeah.  Bunch of panda bears. 
[01:14:30]  Lord of the wasteland, you muggers.  I'll talk to this humongous.  He seems like a reasonable fella.  Right?  No?  What's this kangaroos all over town and stuff?  That's a good one.  We got a guy that's very pissed off at your accent.  Oh, come on.  Because to me it sounds...  I don't hate Australian accents.  I hate fake ones.  To me it sounds like you're from Australia.  I don't know.  Wayne, Texas.  What do you got?  I'm from Santa Bobby.  How could you hate his Australian accent?  I love Australian accents. 
[01:15:00]  The guy that does the Outback one is fake, though.  It doesn't sound real.  He's not Australian.  That's why.  And you are?  I'm Australian, yes.  Why don't you go up at the end when you talk like this?  Talk about, hey, my house caught fire.  We had to grab some water.  Your accent is...  What?  Your accent is terrible as in Australia.  No, it isn't.  Mine's perfect.  You talk...  Go ahead.  Talk like an American.  Go. 
[01:15:30]  Hi there.  How are ya?  That's very funny.  Hi there.  How are ya?  All right.  I'll give you that.  The first word I learned in America was fucking A.  Fucking A.  Isn't that the greatest thing ever, though, to say?  It is.  Come on.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  It really is.  Fucking A is a good one.  Fucking A rules.  Yeah.  Beats a Vegemite sandwich.  And Australians love you, Opie and Anthony.  They love you.  We got ten listeners from here.  Wait, no.  You know what?  Oh, that's not true.  I hear ten.  I hear ten.  Keith Robinson was in Australia. 
[01:16:00]  Man, I must have been over well.  He goes...  Yeah.  Well, they'd never seen one.  And he goes, you guys should go over there.  He goes, every radio guy knows you in Australia.  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  What's that about?  I don't know.  That's weird.  I have no idea how we get hurt over there.  I love Australians.  Come on.  I've been over here 25 years, and I still have my accent.  Yeah, because it gets the girls, right?  No, I'm married, and...  Right, you faggot.  Jesus.  No, American girls love Aussie accents.  They do love the accent, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Do you wear, like, a Crocodile Dundee hat?  No, I don't.  See?  I do wear flip-flops for 365 a year, though.  365?  365.  How is that?  It's every day, stupid.  Oh, sorry, Chip.  Can you do the American accent again, please?  Yeah.  Hi there.  How are you there?  Doing good, yeah.  See, you're just doing it.  That's why I love this.  You're doing the same thing I do when I do the Aussie accent.  We all just exaggerate it, of course.  Like, the Texan thing is, when I call home, I say, oh, I'm fixing to do this, and my brother 
[01:17:00]  will go, you're fixing what?  Oh, so, because you're from Texas now, but you've still got the Aussie thing, so you go,  yeah, I'm fixing to do this.  Yeah, I'm fixing a guy out to the ad back.  Get some potatoes, and a bloomin' onion.  Because he wasn't interested in what you were doing there.  No, he wasn't.  Jimmy, when are you going to Dallas, I think, is what he said.  Oh.  I have only Chicago lined up August 11th, Irvine, September 13th through 15th. 
[01:17:30]  What'd you say, Jimmy?  I don't have Dallas lined up, buddy.  I heard you.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  All right, Wayne.  Thank you, brother.  Thank you, buddy.  Good old Texas checking in.  Where's our Scott and Todd audio?  Iraq?  Great question.  It's coming.  Iraq's hoarding it.  It's coming means you have no idea.  There's nothing good right now.  That's the point.  That's the beauty of it.  There's nothing good coming.  That's the beauty of it.  If you wait for some good Scott and Todd, we'll never get it. 
[01:18:00]  What's the matter with you?  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  No?  Iraq comment?  No?  Nothing?  Iraq.  We'll get something.  Oh, good.  Glad to hear it.  Hmm.  Whew.  You all right?  He's not talking.  He's not being paid attention.  What are you doing, Iraq?  He's got Ant strictly on the pain.  Why did you make believe he had something to do?  I'm a piece of shit over here.  He just made believe he had something to do. 
[01:18:30]  No, I didn't.  I just wrote something down.  He just had a good idea for a storyline for WWE.  What'd you write down?  On my notes here, bad accents.  Is that like a subject you have to?  Yeah, it's kind of funny.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  It kind of worked.  Yeah, it does better.  All right.  We're going to do something after work.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  So, uh, stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM. 
[01:19:00]  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  We should do a montage of the first things when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises. 
[01:19:30]  Make sure all the tones are there.  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Make sure all the tones are there.  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Get some lows.  Get some highs.  Get some lows.  Get some highs.  Get some lows, get some highs, get some lows, get some highs. 
[01:20:00]  Noises!  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep 
[01:20:30]  Thank you. 
[01:21:00]  Sirius XM, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jimmy's got a computer update. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jimmy.  This old gag, by the way, I understand, people.  I understand.  I had a one terabyte, which is a thousand gig hard drive, half full.  It's an external drive, and it's a secure drive, meaning fingerprint gets you in or passcode.  I have a lot of archived stuff on there.  Oh, this isn't a UFC update?  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, no, this is my computer.  I was talking today about my computer. 
[01:22:00]  All of a sudden, I couldn't get into it.  I had lost 500 gigs of information.  That's a lot of information.  Yes.  And 504 gigs, actually.  How much information is that?  Less than a thousand, but more than 500.  A couple hours of information?  Oh, a lot more than that.  A lot of information.  I'd say.  A lot of information lost.  A lot of information.  I couldn't get into the hard drive.  It would unlock.  Like, I plug it in, and it shows like it's a little blinking red light, which tells you  that your hard drive is plugged in, but you cannot access the information. 
[01:22:30]  So, when you swipe your fingerprint, all of a sudden, blink, blink, green.  And when it goes green, icon pops up on your desktop.  The icon was not showing up on my desktop.  So, I couldn't see the information.  Bad file path or something.  Something got corrupted.  Oh, something you don't know what it even means.  A 404?  A 404.  This made the 404.  Forbidden 404?  Yeah.  I wish it was a 403.  Yeah.  This is a 407. 
[01:23:00]  So, I fucking couldn't get in.  I bought a program for 99 bucks, which can actually get in from the back.  Like, as long as you swipe the security code.  Get in from the back.  I like that.  But it said to do a scan.  It said do a basic scan.  It immediately comes back.  No files found.  Do a deep scan.  So, a deep scan.  Fucking do that deep scan.  Doesn't fuck it.  I got in there.  A deep scan right to the bulls.  504 gigs all recovered.  Oh.  None of them named.  Oh, no.  I have 504 gigabytes of unnamed raw material. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  So, whether it's a video, photo.  It shows you what it's video or photo.  But you don't know what it is.  Nothing.  How many individual files would you guess with no names on them?  60,000?  500 gigs is a huge amount.  And then videos.  I saw a couple of videos that are not supposed to be split or split in half.  Oh.  I guess that's what happens when it's a raw thing. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  But I'm going to save the hard drive.  That's how it is on the hard drive.  You got what it is on the hard drive.  So, a lot of times, the pieces aren't put together.  Right.  So, you got the raw fucking...  I mean, I'm glad I...  The good news is that it's there.  Like, thank God it wasn't wiped out, like, physically.  But a bad file...  Eventually, there might be software that can fix that.  Maybe I'll try to do a fixed disk or some shit, but I couldn't.  Just ask Gary Glitter.  He'll help you.  I actually said that on the phone with Lassie.  I was on the phone with Lassie Drive people. 
[01:24:30]  I'm like, well, how do I get my information?  Well, it might just be...  I'm like, what do you mean?  The FBI gets it from criminals all the time.  Exactly.  Wow, you're right.  They don't tell me it's lost.  It's never lost.  No, it's not.  As long as you don't have a physical problem, like, you know, soak it in water or something.  Turn yourself in and have them check your fucking hard drive.  No, there's a few things on there that would be embarrassing.  There's nothing illegal, but there's a few things that would be embarrassing if they got it out.  A lot of cock pictures, which I'd actually be proud of.  Whose?  It reminds me of what E-Rock did for me once. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, what did he do?  Something happened with my phone.  And I lost an Oprah Winfrey picture with my wife and her mom.  Oh, wow.  And I kind of wanted that picture.  That's a once in a lifetime.  And E-Rock found it.  Because he was secretly fucking...  Copying.  Copying all my shit off my phone.  But then he makes believe it was a ghost program.  How did he do that?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  This is years ago.  We're past this.  But still, he should have never done that.  Can you explain that?  I was so happy because the Oprah Winfrey picture was gone. 
[01:25:30]  Done.  Wow.  And I was so depressed because I'm like, yeah, you know, I don't think I'm going to see Oprah  anytime soon.  And, you know, my wife and her mom really wanted this picture of the three of them.  And then E-Rock goes, hey, and gives me a disc one day.  And I was so fucking happy.  I was over the moon, as they say.  Oh.  And then I'm like, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He was nabbing your shit?  I think so.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock's like, no. 
[01:26:00]  Look, he's getting mad.  No.  No.  No shit again.  Because I went through this with you before.  Oh.  Why were you nabbing his shit?  Why were you copying my shit?  I was talking about with something.  Yeah.  And then he lost all his shit.  And he had this program, like a Ghost Rider thing, where you could go on the show.  And then you could go on there and everything you did in your last transactions that you  deleted or whatever.  But I never had transactions.  Yeah.  I never had transactions.  I never had an Oprah Winfrey transaction.  No, but you were pulling something at the time off your camera or whatever it was.  I never had transactions, Ant.  How did you get?  I never had an Oprah Winfrey transaction. 
[01:26:30]  This was like, I don't remember all the details.  I said we're over this.  This was like five years ago.  Sam, you remember when, you remember when E-Rock was copying all my fucking pictures on my phone?  The Oprah Winfrey is.  Oh, yeah.  What is he so mad about?  He gets mad.  It's the truth, though.  Why were you saving his stuff, E-Rock?  Yeah, why were you copying my stuff?  I wasn't copying your shit.  I was helping you out with something at the time.  And because we were able to save your damn fucking camera or whatever. 
[01:27:00]  How did you get my Oprah Winfrey?  That is true.  How did you get my Oprah Winfrey picture?  Wow, he's mad.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he's like, oh, don't worry.  I have a copy.  He handed me the disc.  I was so happy.  And you're like, oh, great.  Believe me, I was so happy.  But then you also think to yourself.  I was like, wait a minute.  Why does he have all my stuff?  Why does he have all my pictures?  Man.  Look at this man.  Oh, he's saving his stuff, E-Rock.  What was he saving his shit?  All right, explain this.  Explain this.  How did you get the Oprah Winfrey picture back out of nowhere?  If I remember it right, you gave me the memory card. 
[01:27:30]  We were pulling something off of it.  It was the early days before Twitter and all.  And we were posting pictures, I think.  So we went into one of the computers in the back.  We popped it in there.  It shows up.  And I don't remember what we did at that time.  You copied all my pictures.  Put it in a secret file.  I was just fucking copying your damn photos.  That's weird.  It does sound like you were.  So E-Rock's copying the photos, all right.  That's weird.  So he had all your photos on his computer.  Why would you have his photos?  What was the file called? 
[01:28:00]  Apparently you did.  Did you have a password on it?  And what was it?  Abs.  Yeah.  What was the folder called?  I hate your guts.  Oh, man.  Why do I put up with this shit?  Yeah, what was the folder called?  Sex fodder.  All right, walk us through this.  Because I'm still very confused.  But I'm not, you know.  It is suspicious is the only thing.  It is.  It really is.  Because it's like a nice gesture.  I'm not tech savvy.  So walk us through this.  And Sam, you tell me if this is logical.  Okay.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:28:30]  E-Rock, coming?  You needed a picture.  I could outstare you any day.  Good.  Oh, man.  You won that one, by the way.  E-Rock was watching it.  I know.  I saw that.  Walk us through this.  There was some picture that I wanted to put on the website, probably, at the time.  I'm guessing, at the time, there was something that you needed.  That would be probably accurate.  Yeah.  Okay.  There was something that you needed.  All right.  And usually, Steve would do this stuff. 
[01:29:00]  Archive all of his photos.  Yes.  All right.  So we're in agreement.  Yeah.  There was something on my phone, a picture, let's say, that maybe was important to the  radio show that day, that we wanted to show people.  Something.  Because it was before the Twitter and the Facebook.  Right.  Okay.  So we went and got the photo off your drive.  Mm-hmm.  And...  I guess the...  Oh, I'm sure. 
[01:29:30]  You sound guilty.  You sound guilty.  I don't remember exactly.  You sound guilty.  That's why I was getting so mad, by the way.  Yeah.  To cover up the guilt.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah.  One time, I fixed your wife's hard drive, and I had to make a backup of it.  Right.  But, like, if she now came to me and was like, oh, I lost all my stuff, and I was like,  oh, don't worry.  I saved a copy of it.  You wouldn't be able to do that.  She'd be like, what?  So you're suspicious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm suspicious of this whole thing.  This was like one day.  Why would you have his shit?  Because I deleted...  You deleted it after you. 
[01:30:00]  Why'd you save his backup?  Why'd you save his backup?  It's strange.  I didn't save his backup.  You did.  No, I did.  You had it.  He had it.  He had it.  That's true.  We got a program that went in and pulled shit off that you delete off a computer.  You could still go and find it on the computer and pull it back.  Well, why'd you have it, then, on your computer?  Yeah, it was in a folder called OP.  How'd you get it on the computer, Ant?  That's not the trap.  How does that work?  Do you have all your hero's stuff on...  Yeah, apparently I do.  Oh, jeez, he's so mad.  I'm not even in the top 100 at this point. 
[01:30:30]  No, I don't think so.  You're well below Hulk Hogan now.  I get uncomfortable with that shit.  It really is.  I've got to knock that shit off.  Oh, boy.  So, did you copy my entire phone?  No, I didn't copy your shit.  I believe he did.  I think he did, too.  But then how'd you get the Oprah picture?  I don't remember.  We did something, and we got it back.  What happened with the Oprah picture?  How'd you get it?  Yeah, why did you save the Oprah picture?  Why'd you save the Oprah picture?  A screen saver?  Why would I save the Oprah photo?  Exactly.  He didn't just save the Oprah photo.  He saved all the photos.  Oprah was in there.  Every photo.  Yeah, I get it. 
[01:31:00]  Why'd you save that?  Yeah.  What happened?  I don't know.  Because he's sitting there going, oh, my God, I used to listen to this guy every day,  and now I have all the photos.  This is the coolest thing ever.  I get it.  But why is his answer, I don't know.  I don't like that.  You're tech savvy.  How did it go down?  I already told you this.  No.  Keep asking the same question.  But it's not clear.  You're going to keep getting the same answer.  But you're not clear.  What happened?  I don't know.  It was like six years ago.  But how did you end up with this shit on your computer?  Stuff that I didn't ask you to copy or put up on websites. 
[01:31:30]  It was actually a private photo.  Stuff other than the Oprah stuff.  Yeah, no one's ever seen that photo.  What happened?  Iraq coming.  Iraq coming.  Eric has.  He's in his house.  Not only has he seen it, he fucking had a copy of it and he was probably showing people.  Yeah.  So bad.  Look at the boss's private photos.  Why is it mad?  And I did say we're over this.  I'm just.  He'd be gone.  Yeah, he's over it.  We're over it.  Because in the end, I was extremely happy.  Everyone's over it.  Exactly.  A picture I thought was long gone all of a sudden was handed to me on a disc.  It was amazing.  Because it was on a computer the whole time.  And now we have prints of the picture. 
[01:32:00]  It's beautiful.  It's nice.  You have a backup of your computer on a hard drive and then a backup on Iraq's computer.  Absolutely.  Which is nice.  And why is this guy explaining better than you?  JD, New York City.  Opie, when you load pics from a cam to a computer in Windows Media.  Did we have Windows Media?  Oh, boy.  It's whatever we had on the computers at the time.  It automatically stores it in a backup file on the computer.  You can always find it later on the computer if it dumps from the camera.  Oh!  Oh, this guy got you up.  Sam?  I mean, if you make a backup file and you don't need it, you'd throw it out. 
[01:32:30]  That's right.  The only reason to make people...  Well, why would you ever make a backup file if all I'm saying is, hey, could you get this  one picture up on the website?  Right.  Exactly.  Like, if somebody was like, hey, can you import my photos for me?  I wouldn't then back them up.  I'd be like, that's my hard drive.  I said, here's this one picture, whatever it was that day, tits, maybe, or...  You're actually going to still have Opie's stuff on your computer.  I don't have anything of his.  I bet you do.  What do you have on this computer that says, photo-wise?  Are you enjoying all the baby pictures? 
[01:33:00]  And why was the Oprah photo imported to begin with?  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  It hadn't...  It's weird.  No one even knew that that was on the camera.  It is weird.  Eric did.  Yeah.  That was the other thing.  It's creepy.  I told everyone how bummed I was I lost my Oprah picture.  Next thing I know, he's handing me an Oprah picture.  That's weird.  He's got it for you.  You're writing.  Comment.  Yeah, so even if Windows Media did make a ghost backup...  Right.  He said it was a ghost program that found this picture.  Ghost program.  But regardless, it means he imported the photo at some point. 
[01:33:30]  That's what I'm saying.  He never should have.  So why would you do that?  Because he wants a copy of your stuff.  I didn't purposely take your shit.  No.  Oh, shit.  Why do you want the boss's pictures?  Oh, now the truth comes out.  He'd probably look at them and pretend that he was on vacation too.  Yeah, I was taking the photo for this one.  No, he didn't steal it.  He made a copy of it.  He made a copy for himself.  Why are you turning red?  I said we're over this.  I'm just bringing it back because I'm just a little confused.  You're embarrassed.  I'm okay that you steal my shit.  It's fine if you love the boss.  I won't love the boss. 
[01:34:00]  Nothing.  Except that.  It's all good.  So he had to make a backup, Sam?  Yeah, he imported all your photos.  Why would you import all of them if I only needed the one?  I don't fucking know.  He's tech savvy enough to just import one if he only needed one.  I don't even know how to do that.  He just wanted copies for himself?  He wanted to make a little Opie backup for himself.  Just in case.  Just in case.  Do you have that?  Do you print them out?  It's called the hero file. 
[01:34:30]  And then the hero file.  I haven't saved it there.  Do you look at pictures of Opie being like, need it, got it, need it, got it?  Oh, yeah.  Like baseball cards.  And swap them out.  He got very jealous.  There's a picture of me and Opie on my computer.  And he was like, I don't need that one.  You're looking to pawn these or sell them?  What are you yelling?  Opie pics.  It's all right.  At least you know your stuff's backed up.  Yeah, yeah.  You never have to worry about any of your pics.  E-Rock's got them all.  Throw your computer out the window.  Yeah.  You don't need them.  You don't need it.  He's like a clude.  He's the E-Rock clude. 
[01:35:00]  I'm not leaving my phone laying around anymore.  It's in my front pocket.  Yeah.  Come get it now.  He will.  So you don't know is your answer?  Yeah.  I see.  He's steaming, man.  He is steaming.  But there's just a lot of mystery.  But I live for this.  E-Rock, I live for this moment.  E-Rock.  So your answer is I don't know.  That's fair.  But there is a lot of mystery.  It's the whole thing.  Yeah.  Sam, you would have just imported one photo, put it up on the website,  and not given a care, as Colin would say, about my pictures. 
[01:35:30]  How many photos did you want on the website?  One.  Maybe it was a couple that day.  I don't know.  Maybe it was a series.  Do you want the Oprah one on the website?  No.  Yeah, I wouldn't have imported that one.  Because why would I have?  I don't care about your Oprah picture.  Congratulations.  You met Oprah.  E-Rock, I was very grateful.  There were a lot of very...  And you'd probably be grateful in the future when you lose something else.  He can just go into his computer and pull up any of your Snapchat keys.  He's got a spare set.  He's probably got a spare set of your house keys. 
[01:36:00]  Did you enjoy all my pictures from Soda's Point?  Oh, man.  All backed up.  Well, now he can just drag and drop from Twitter.  He does.  Do you save all of his pics from Twitter?  No.  In a file?  He does.  Yeah, nine million sunset photos.  Oh!  Motherfucker, you face!  Bad say that!  Bad say that!  Oh, shit!  God damn!  He didn't just say that.  God damn!  Oh, God damn!  Damn!  You're nasty.  Nailed you.  I don't have a comeback for that.  That hurt.  I enjoy a good sunset. 
[01:36:30]  Who doesn't, right?  Roland enjoys a good sunset.  God, enough of his fucking Skyline pictures.  I think he's calmed down with those.  Not really.  No?  No.  I might have blocked him.  I don't know.  My problem with Roland is it's the same view every...  I try to change it up and throw a glory hole.  I try to change up my sunsets.  Oh, enough of his fucking...  It's a little variety there.  New York City Skyline.  Did E-Rock take the picture of you and Oprah?  Oh.  Oh, that would make sense.  It's probably on your camera.  No one knew the Oprah picture existed. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  And then, because I am...  That's a lot weirder, then.  Yeah, I'm friends with E-Rock outside the show.  I did say one day I was really bummed.  And next thing you know, he's handing me a disc with the picture on it.  Hang on.  That's weird to me.  Can I bring something up?  What happened?  When E-Rock takes the photos in here, right?  Of us with celebrities, right?  He takes the pictures.  He emails them to us.  And then he does give us those things.  He's very good with that.  He's awesome with that.  At the end...  But then, like, at the end of the year, he goes, here's all your pics.  And I love that, too.  But why is he holding on to them? 
[01:37:30]  Well, it's work pictures.  I don't mind that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, these are work photos.  I'm okay with it.  Don't question that, because I really like what he does.  I need those, yeah.  Because I lose all mine.  I'm reaching at straws here to try to bash him.  I understand.  No, I like it.  It's okay if he...  I don't hate everything about E-Rock.  So they were off his camera.  Delete, delete, delete.  Oh, shit!  Now he's threatening.  The only weird thing is...  It'd be like, if you said, hey, Eric, can you make this photo of me off my phone a little  larger? 
[01:38:00]  And then all of a sudden, he's got all your dick pics and stuff on his computer.  All my dick pics that he's just drooling over.  I don't take dick pics.  I'm good.  Oh, no.  Come on, now.  Everyone takes dick pics.  Oh, this is not good news.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Someone's going to tell you it's impossible, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  They're not importing all the photos.  Oh, no.  Somebody wants to share a personal story that would relate to this exact thing.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Let him come in and explain that.  Troy.  Of course he does.  Troy Kwan. 
[01:38:30]  Troy Kwan has an E-Rock tale to regale upon us.  I'm learning that E-Rock wants to just kind of nurture and take care of everybody around  him.  He does.  I want to hang E-Rock out to dry.  Where's his music, E-Rock?  Ah, there it is.  All right.  Sally to the rescue.  Troy, have you been listening to this?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Are you tech savvy?  Not really.  A little bit.  You are.  Well, Mike's working.  He's too busy lifting weights and pounding pussy.  What mic is that? 
[01:39:00]  Mike's seven.  Seven?  Oh.  Where's seven?  It's on.  Seven's a good name.  Yeah, but everything else is on.  Try that.  Great name for a kid.  All right.  You're tech savvy, right?  A little bit.  Do you find it weird that I thought I lost a photo and next thing you know, he's giving  me a disc with the photo on it?  Yeah.  It doesn't surprise me in the least.  Why are you surprised?  What's the explanation?  I'm confused.  Because I have given Eric, I've played him stuff.  I've played him bits that weren't finished.  I've played him songs that I was working on from, you know, my personal, you know, whatever. 
[01:39:30]  And I've, I watched him import the file to save it.  Oh.  I was like, dude, what are you doing?  E-Rock.  What do you say?  Why do you do this?  Why would I save your songs?  Why would you save his songs?  I don't know.  I was asking why you were doing it.  He's an e-hoarder.  E-Rock.  Why are you doing this?  Are you a digital hoarder?  Oh, man.  I love files.  I don't have his music.  Where do you save them to, by the way?  Where do you save them to?  Do you have a folder called pals? 
[01:40:00]  How does he abscond them from your computer?  Yeah, why are you doing that, E-Rock?  I had it on a jump drive.  Oh, you had it on a drive.  Okay.  And then I would hand it to him, like, hey, pull this file off, or here, let me play  you something.  And he just grabs every fucking file off of it.  Do you have droid tracks?  He probably wants nudie pictures, maybe.  He thinks maybe you fucked up.  You threw some fucking nudes on there.  He's open.  And he's like, I'll get these.  He's open it.  I'll sell.  You're trying to get dirt on all of us for a book?  E-Rock, is that what you're doing?  A tell-all?  A tell-all book.  Maybe some pics.  What is it? 
[01:40:30]  E-Rock?  Oh, boy.  Is he fucking pissed.  I love this, though.  I don't know how old you are.  I don't know how old you are.  I'm a collector.  I'm a collector.  I'm stimulated.  I'm alive.  It's like, it's a little unsettling.  Good thing that dummy couldn't think of disconcerting.  I know.  Did you watch him fucking back out of that word?  Dis, dis, time.  Dis, bad.  Troy, if I gave you my phone and I said I need one picture on the website, would you, like,  copy my entire phone to do that?  That's just being invasive. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, isn't it?  So you're saying E-Rock's being invasive, which he has been.  But see, does it really surprise you, though?  But see, I'm confused because he really saved my ass.  So I can't be too mad at him.  But then it's like, wow, that's weird.  But he saved it through his own fucking shit.  Right.  You know, trying to get everybody's shit.  Right.  Like, if you had been like, oh, man, I had some great pictures of me and my girl at the  beach.  I can't believe I lost them all.  And then Eric was like, no, you didn't.  Here they are.  Here they are.  Wow.  That's cool.  You got everyone's back. 
[01:41:30]  I know I've left a few times to maybe take a piss or something, and I've left my phones  here.  You got mine backed up there, E-Rock?  Apparently I do.  Oh, right.  Oh, wow.  Just in case.  Contacts or anything.  Very good.  Any contacts that I'm missing?  Why aren't you mad at him?  He's got your back.  How does he get it, though?  What is he putting it on from a thumb drive?  What is it?  Bagel's got your back.  He just opened up Audition real quick.  I watched him do it.  Oh.  And he just imports it, and then he minimized it real quick. 
[01:42:00]  So I wouldn't see that.  Oh, man.  Like a sneaky fuck.  Oh, no.  You minimized it?  What fucking music of yours that I've taken?  Whoa.  You should.  If you're taking it, you'll know he's.  Sneaky Pete.  Yeah.  Why did you minimize it so fast?  That sounds sneaky.  Troy, why did you minimize it?  Why?  You fucking...  I don't remember taking his music.  It was actually the stuff I was worth.  You're not bullshitting?  We've never used your shit.  Whoa.  I'm not going to tell you what it was.  So he minimized it, Troy?  Yeah.  Troy saw it.  But he rocks just trying to take care of you, Troy.  Just in case you lose. 
[01:42:30]  I'm more apt to believe Troy Kwan on this one.  I'm going to tell you what it was.  Seeing how he's stolen Opie's pics.  He had Opie's Oprah picture.  Constantly taking Opie's pictures.  Yeah.  He's got all of Opie's personal pictures on his computer.  His hands in his...  His face is in his hands like I'm fucking...  What's the matter, E-Rock?  Come on.  Just fess up.  It's very, very, very warm right now.  Yeah.  Why are you warm?  You embarrassed?  You missed your pictures.  I'll say.  But...  Yeah.  Are you looking at all the pictures that you could be downloading right now? 
[01:43:00]  Just imagine, though, the most important picture.  It was up there at the time.  And you think it's...  What a coincidence.  And all of a sudden he hands you a disc like two days later ago.  Here it is.  Anything else you need, Opie?  Anything else?  And I was so happy.  Any pics.  I got it.  Don't sweat it.  What other pictures you saved that day?  I have no fucking clue.  Because that was the headliner.  But I think there was a whole bunch of other ones that I...  Well, what else did you have on your phone?  Yeah.  That's the answer.  Must be a lot.  It was five, six years ago.  Word.  He's got them all. 
[01:43:30]  You're like fucking the guy from One Hour Photo.  Yeah.  You just put all of Opie's pictures up on the wall.  Uncle Si.  Yeah, Uncle Si.  Uncle Si.  Uncle Si.  Si the photo guy.  You think he X's me out of all the photos?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're just scraped out with a key.  He puts his head on my body.  He's got his secret room.  He's got his fucking dumps in your house.  With those creepy...  He's streaming of dumps in your house.  With those fucking creepy construction lights shining on the wall of everybody's photos.  Everyone's shocked when they walk in and see it.  You did that to Opie's photos? 
[01:44:00]  Did you do that?  No, he probably has like the digital photos so he can have like, you know, like the fucking  the digital photo frame.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  And just scroll through a bunch of different ones.  Yeah, and he probably has one that will just have all of Opie's pictures on.  He just sits in a stark room, one chair, staring at it as it just changes.  When Opie comes over, he pops it out real quick and puts in another one of like cool  wrestling pictures.  Iraq, did you back up my shit just in case?  Back that shit up.  I think so. 
[01:44:30]  No.  I believe so.  No.  Just give it out.  Do you feel better?  I'm just going to say yes.  I think, I mean, I have my own theories.  What are your theories?  What's your theories?  Troy Kwan.  I think he had good intentions, but the fact is he was backing up my shit.  You don't think he had good intentions?  No.  He was backing up the shit.  I think he just hangs on to stuff just in case he like, he needs it in a pinch.  You know what I mean?  Troy, can I, sorry guys, can I save the day?  Whoa, Sal!  Hey, Sal!  Oh, E-Rock.  And by the way, can I mention something about Sal real quick?  Please do.  Usually he has no balls because yesterday we were all talking about E-Rock on the after show 
[01:45:00]  and it wasn't bad.  We weren't even making jokes about him.  Oh, man.  But we said something about him being physical and Sal said, I can't believe that none of  you guys, after E-Rock left the room, he said, I can't believe none of you guys made  fat jokes about E-Rock being physical.  Then he said, I can't believe that none of you guys made jokes about E-Rock eating spam  when you were talking about Twitter spam.  Right, right.  So he's got all the E-Rock jokes in his head, but he's very afraid to... 
[01:45:30]  I thought about the spam thing when he was sending Opie spam and we were talking about  it.  I thought about the spam joke, but it just seemed hack, really.  I mean, it's so obvious.  But Sal will throw out a good E-Rock fat joke behind Eric's back.  No, no, no.  Sal, what...  Behind his back.  I won't do that.  What do you have to contribute to this whole E-Rock stealing everyone's pictures?  First off...  That's everyone.  I never made a fat joke about Eric unless it was to his face.  But the thing I wanted to talk about, about Eric hoarding electronic files, he once asked 
[01:46:00]  me to import into Delight one of Troy's latest mixtapes.  Why is that?  Oh, wow.  You're on comics, but Snooki likes it, so now you like it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, what do you think, you're Snooki or something?  Why would you do that?  Well, because if we ever did the club O&A thing again, Troy's last... I don't know if  it was the last one, the one before that had some good mixes.  I was like, I'd bring that up there.  There's a reasonable doubt.  That would hold up in court.  I'd bring it on the air, but apparently no need to do so.  Maybe on your iPod, too? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Maybe.  That's the way to go, Sal.  Whoa!  Oh, man!  He was like, fuck you, new guy.  Yeah.  You're not his boss anymore.  You tried to jab Iraq, and he fucking got you right back.  Sal's not an intern anymore.  He can't boss him around.  I'm just trying to slowly get back when he told everybody that I went to Gary about the  thing in the past.  Oh, man.  The Kenny thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, but then we straightened that out, because I thought you did.  Yeah, but it was an extended period of time.  It wasn't, like, fucking you over. 
[01:47:00]  It was, we honestly thought you did.  Oh, man.  No, I was pissed.  I came to you right away about it, though.  Who fucked who in this deal?  Oh, I definitely got my ass blinded.  You fucked everybody?  No, I got fucked.  But I think Iraq, in all fairness, explained himself, is what Iraq said, and you guys moved  past that.  And it wasn't my issue to begin with.  This was your problem that you were dealing with.  I know, but it went for a couple months there, where Kenny thought I was the one who went  there.  Troy, you want to make a tub of shit joke?  Troy's so happy.  Anything?  No?  No.  Right?  Just trying to help. 
[01:47:30]  I'm very grateful that Iraq backs up all my shit, just in case I lose stuff.  I am.  Yeah, yeah.  Everything.  Yeah, but you don't know.  It's just weird, because what is he using it for?  But what's he using it for?  Just in case, I think.  What about those contract emails that Bob sends?  You got those, Iraq?  Got any of the contract stuff that Eman sends or anything?  No.  This is what I truly believe.  Okay.  He backed up all my shit.  Backed that shit up.  Because he knows that maybe I'm irresponsible enough where I might fuck up and lose some  shit, and he'll have it for me. 
[01:48:00]  That's nice.  So that's what I really believe.  He can be the hero who helps you.  But he thumbs through it occasionally, too.  Yeah.  But he might take a look every once in a while.  He just keeps it.  I once borrowed your computer and backed up all your videos for you.  What do you got?  On a hard drive for you.  You got some shit, don't you?  If you lose your videos, they're gone.  I don't have any of them.  That's the difference.  I don't have any of your stuff.  But you don't have a ghost program to just find them out of thin air?  I never put them on my computer to start with.  Iraq?  Ghost program?  What's that?  What's that all about?  Ghost program?  I remember at the time you said it was a ghost program. 
[01:48:30]  Was it a ghost program?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Because I questioned you.  Ghost protocol?  I questioned him, and he knew that I was kind of dumb in that arena.  And he just threw the ghost program thing at me.  I went, oh, ghost program.  Nice.  It's a ghost program.  That does sound like something you could just use as an excuse.  Right.  Yeah, have all your shit.  Ghost program.  Ghost program.  Oh, well, it's a ghost program.  I don't know what that is.  You can't argue it's a ghost program.  I think that's a load of shit.  And I think we should give him a lie detector test.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Would you do that?  Yeah, let's do Scott and Todd shit. 
[01:49:00]  Whoa!  Now he's calling us hack radio.  Spam joke.  Did you back up my shit?  No, I didn't back up your shit.  Just in case I might need it someday?  Nope.  That was nice, yeah?  That was very nice, yeah.  In the end, if Opie needed any picture right now, could you come up with one?  I haven't given him my phone in one.  Honestly.  If it was in this studio?  Oh.  Yeah.  Because the ones you took.  The ones I took.  That's fine.  What about something that was on his phone?  Oh, no.  Whatever was on his phone five, six years ago.  Don't say no, you weren't able to fucking pull him off. 
[01:49:30]  Are you Wi-Fi in my shit right now?  Are you?  Yeah.  Right now.  Sucked it all away.  I love him.  He's hilarious.  He loves sucking it all away.  Oh, no.  I like that E-Rock does the photos in here.  He does a good job.  It really is.  He could come in faster, though.  I was yelling at him, by the way.  It doesn't matter how quickly he comes in.  I'm like, E-Rock, what took you?  Like you were waiting there awkwardly with the talent. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, with masturbated breath.  Remember when E-Rock used to come in, though, and say, you want a picture in front of the person?  Yeah.  Which means, get up and take a picture, because he can't say no.  I had to explain it, E-Rock.  Don't come in and say, Anthony, do you want a picture with this person?  Because sometimes I don't want one.  Like yesterday.  That was years ago, too.  But now it's, oh, I never do this.  Can I get a photo?  Look, I realize it was pounds years ago.  But, but.  Hey, E-Rock, I'm sorry.  I got an example of that.  Yesterday, I did not take a picture with Elijah Wood. 
[01:50:30]  The old E-Rock would have said, would you like a picture?  And that would have been awkward.  Like, all right, now I got to take a picture with the guy.  I know.  The only reason I didn't take a picture with the guy is because I got pictures last time.  Yeah.  That's all.  Somebody raised, somebody said, I was talking about this situation.  They wrote, single white bovine.  That's funny.  That's pretty funny.  That's terrible.  Oh, my God.  The only thing is, he did make copies.  There are white rhinos in the wild, aren't there? 
[01:51:00]  I think so.  Yeah.  He did make copies of all your pictures for himself, which is weird.  You think so, Sam?  Because you would just import what you need for that day.  Yeah.  And then you'd get rid of it.  You know?  Yeah.  It'd be gone.  Yeah.  He fucking copied all my shit that day.  Yeah, he did.  He imported all the photos.  Oh, yeah.  You got all my text messages?  Yeah, I guess.  I'll have to go look.  You know what?  If you do, man.  He does.  He's very helpful.  It's happening here.  He does.  Very helpful if you got my text messages. 
[01:51:30]  I'm serious.  That's a little bit of a test.  Do you have them?  No.  Come on.  Be helpful.  Look for them.  I don't have any of your shit.  That's not true.  You used to, though.  No.  Now he's calling you for the shit.  You used to before you completely hated me.  It's terrible.  Well, technically, yesterday, you said you were pissed off that E-Rock is in your life.  Well, man.  So, it's not like...  I didn't really mean that.  I meant part of that.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:52:00]  Somehow that's worse.  Poor E-Rock.  Am I still invited to your house this weekend?  Oh, this weekend's the big fucking party.  You know what I heard?  What?  Anthony might go to E-Rock's party.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going.  Whoa.  Fuck yeah, man.  Whoa.  I'm totally going.  Why would he do it when we're not there on purpose?  He did.  Yeah, he really did fuck you guys off.  Comic-Con is the pop culture event of the year.  Fucked you guys.  Everybody knows the dates.  This is only the third year in a row that Jim and I have gone.  Why didn't you check that out first?  Make sure. 
[01:52:30]  How about you reschedule?  Everyone's going to be around.  So, Jim reschedule.  How about you don't come?  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Oh.  Is Obi coming?  I guess I'm not.  I don't know.  I didn't hear an acceptance from him, so I didn't know.  This is my RSVP, by the way.  I will be attending.  Then I shall send you the address.  Oh.  Wait.  We had an RSVP?  No.  Yes.  An invite was sent out.  Don't our broads do all that?  Was it email?  Our broads will do that.  Oh.  I didn't get back to that.  Yeah, I didn't know.  I don't read your email.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Figured.  I read your emails.  Sometimes he just forwards me Opie's pictures.  I don't know.  I'm like, what is he doing?  Why is he doing this?  Do you read the invitation, Jim, to the party?  No.  Oh.  I lost that one.  Can I watch wrestling at the party?  I'll just sit there on my phone and look at wrestling.  You could.  There's an extensive library there.  Oh.  Of course there is.  Jess is going to the party.  Don't try any funny stuff.  Look.  Is she?  A joke's a joke, but I would never infringe on the sanctity of your marriage.  She might need a ride like that. 
[01:53:30]  She's got a ride.  She's got a ride.  What about you?  With who?  You're giving her a ride.  What about you?  What about you?  That's right.  I'm going to be in Comic Con.  E-Rock purposely scheduled it on a day I couldn't come.  Holy shit.  Hey, hey.  No, no.  I'm just saying, holy shit, you should fucking be there.  And I'm having a sleepover with Sam's wife.  What?  Oh!  Okay, now it's just weird, because your wife is fucking weird.  She's sleeping over it, though.  Isn't she?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man.  And I sleepwalk.  Do you?  Just saying.  Yeah, I do. 
[01:54:00]  Lulu!  Why?  Why?  You know what?  A little time out on Long Island, perhaps.  I got plenty of room.  She doesn't have a bathing suit.  That never matters.  Oh, okay, good.  In my pool, bathing suits are extremely optional.  Oh, okay, good, good.  So it doesn't really matter.  E-Rock's seen those pictures, right?  Apparently I have.  He's got a couple copies.  E-Rock, comment, you've had all of those pictures, yeah?  No.  Oh, man.  I'm just excited that you're coming now.  Why are you sending your wife a loan like that? 
[01:54:30]  I'm not sending her.  She's a person with free will.  Oh, wow.  No, you're married.  You're supposed to fucking put the hammer down.  Oh, shit, really?  Exactly.  You know what you gotta do?  Belt her in the fucking eye before you leave.  Show her some Taliban videos.  Fucking show me some respect!  No, because then I belt her in the eye, and you go,  Jess, you shouldn't let him treat you like that.  A pelvis to cry on.  Yeah.  Yeah, a pelvis.  I'm teasing, of course.  Of course.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for your marriage and your love, 
[01:55:00]  and her vows were too fucking great to even try to infringe upon.  Right.  How wonderful.  You too, Nagel.  Keep your paws off.  Oh, man.  Keep your flippers off.  Has he been tweeting her?  Get it, E-Rock?  Why aren't you mad at him?  Why aren't you mad at him?  We're just having fun.  We're just busting bulls.  Why don't you give him the evil look for that?  We're just busting bulls.  Look, let's wrap up by saying, E-Rock, I want to thank you for illegally copying all  my shit five years ago. 
[01:55:30]  Holding on to it.  Guaranteed they're still on the computer, by the way.  Guaranteed there's a computer with all your pics on it.  Or at least a hard drive.  Yeah, a hard drive something.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got text messages?  No.  Damn it.  But he does have the photos.  And any video you took.  He sits there like Rupert Pupkin.  He's just like, Opie, I have your pictures.  If you need them, I got them.  Yeah, he fantasized that Opie will go, why don't you come by the house?  Yeah, come by the house with the pictures.  We'll go over them.  They're calling you the angel of death. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Where you smother people just, you know, but you're not like killing them so you can  be the hero and bring them back to life.  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  Okay.  If he had a kid, like the kid would have whatever, that Munchausen syndrome.  Oh, boy.  You would purposely get your kid sick.  You don't.  E-Rock's future kids, don't drink that soup.  You ever seen Sixth Sense?  Oh, my God.  Don't drink that soup.  Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  Right.  Something like that.  Don't drink that soup. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  I want to thank you for the Oprah picture.  I really do.  In the end, I was very happy.  See?  It worked out for the best.  I just want him to be honest about it.  That's all.  But his whole fucking, yeah, the whole thing is, you know.  It's a wash.  It worked out for the best, but.  I'd be so pissed at him if I didn't have the Oprah picture, but I have the Oprah picture,  so I can't be mad in the end.  So it is a wash, so you should just admit it at this point.  E-Rock, admit it.  Just admit it.  You backed up all my shit just in case. 
[01:57:00]  Just because you love him.  Just to have it.  It'd be like me having Ozzy stuff on my computer.  Right.  Exactly.  I'd look at it.  Hey, there's Ozzy and Sharon in Schenectady.  You feel about Opie the way Jimmy feels about Ozzy, right?  Yeah.  No?  There was a time.  I would save Ozzy stuff.  Look at his Ozzy.  He's fucking.  He's hitting Scott Shannon territory.  Oh!  Oh, no.  Oh!  Who, me?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Looks wise or just like.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Dick wise.  Poor Opie.  Wow.  Oh, E-Rock.  Nailed him. 
[01:57:30]  Damn it.  Nagel's getting a little fucking ballsy these days.  That's all I want from the kid.  It really is.  That's all I want from the kid.  And your Oprah picture.  Remember when he didn't say shit?  And my Oprah picture.  E-Rock used to take shit like crazy.  Now he's fucking spidering.  You haven't solved your little issue with Troy.  I'm good with you.  I'm just a little confused.  What's up with you and Troy?  You got a big problem with Troy Kwan.  Apparently I do.  This is Opie at his finest.  Opie goes, I'm good with you.  I am.  That wasn't the issue.  That was the same thing.  I wrote it down and I never brought it up. 
[01:58:00]  What did I write down?  Oh.  What did I write down?  I was writing shit down.  This is what he said about Kixson.  Carol Miller on Monday.  Oh.  Carol Miller, when he found out that she wrote in his book that you guys mistreated her.  In her book.  In her book.  Yeah, sorry.  Opie goes.  She does look like a he sometimes.  Opie couldn't understand it.  And his quote was, I let that go years ago.  You didn't have anything done to you.  No.  It's not up to you to let it go.  That is true.  Like when you bring in Eric and then just drag him through shit and then be like, Eric, 
[01:58:30]  I'm good with you.  Maybe Eric's not good with you at that point.  But I don't care about that part of it.  He doesn't make a good point.  I need to work this shit out in my own head.  I'm going to fuck what you think.  Yeah, you can sleep at night, right?  Of course I can.  You're good to go.  I was just confused, so I brought it up again.  That's all.  Troy Kwan?  You figured it out.  Yeah.  Problem?  Problem?  What are you thinking, Troy?  Apparently I'm stealing his music.  No.  Are you saying it's not worth stealing?  Oh!  That's what I hear there. 
[01:59:00]  You really just bad-mouthed him.  He's getting all wires on you.  Is his music worth stealing, at least?  It was an unfinished song at the time.  Oh, man.  It was a track that I was working on with Jerry when Jerry worked here.  Why'd you minimize it like you were being sneaky?  What'd you do?  You did minimize.  Why'd you minimize?  Why didn't you just leave it open when he came in?  I don't know why you're not minimizing.  Oh!  See, see, there you go.  I couldn't help it, though.  I just couldn't help it.  We're still doing a radio show.  But I hope he doesn't have a problem anymore.  But he let it go.  He's all good.  He let it go.  I'm good.  It's fine. 
[01:59:30]  I hope he's good.  I'm good.  I hope he's good.  It's weird that you have the word minimize in your vocabulary.  I just made a fat joke to your face.  Why do you have a problem with that?  I'm good, though.  I love him.  We're good.  We're good.  He's good with you.  We're good.  Don't worry about him.  We're good.  It's not about me.  It's about Troy Kwan, remember?  Yeah.  That's true.  You are a chubby bubbly.  Oh, Jimmy.  Man, oh, man.  Why do you tickle him and you're violent to me?  I was touching one of his chins.  But you're nice and...  Oh!  Nailed him.  Fucking Iraq.  I love this.  He's really coming to the table. 
[02:00:00]  Eric's getting crazy.  Go ahead, Troy.  What's your problem with him?  Because now I'm good, so let's figure out your problem now.  I don't have a problem.  No, I just wanted to contribute to the idea that he...  I think he's a file hoarder.  He just collects whatever he can and just keeps it for whatever reason.  I don't know if...  A book.  Maybe a book or blackmail down the road.  Blackmail, right.  I don't think it's blackmail.  I can't...  No, I can't play it that way.  Could be.  I think Iraq is a nurturer.  I think Iraq...  They're playing your clip again there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  On Imas.  And I think that he has it in him to try to take care of everybody around him 
[02:00:30]  that is either married to him or a friend or family.  I don't think Eric...  He's that guy.  He's got that personality.  I don't think Eric has malice either.  I don't think he's hoarding stuff for blackmail.  No, I don't think so at all.  No, I don't think he...  I don't think he has...  I think he just likes to have everything and be...  And he likes...  Everything!  He likes the power of being able to, Opie, as you said, save the day.  Yeah, save the day.  I have the Oprah photo.  He nurtures.  He likes to nurture. 
[02:01:00]  Any problem with Iraq, Roland?  I'm good.  No, you're good?  Wow.  Oh, that means...  He doesn't want to get into any more trouble after yesterday.  Roland has a huge...  Oh, shit.  Roland always has problems with everybody, though.  I guess people are pissed we had Bryan Cranston on our show.  That's right.  Yeah.  Who's pissed we had Bryan...  What do you mean?  I'm talking about this one, yeah?  On the after show.  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  A little bit.  Roland was a little worried because some people...  Because of Ballsy on that after show.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Cutting edge.  Did you fucking put Spy Bubble on my phone?  Did you put Spy Bubble on Opius' phone? 
[02:01:30]  Spy Bubble.  Oh.  John in Cleveland saying you fucking...  How do I check for Spy Bubble?  It's a ghost program.  You got Spy Bubble on my phone?  Yeah.  I went ahead six years and hacked your phone.  No!  Whoa!  Hey, I leave my phone laying around.  You could have fucking installed the Spy Bubble.  Yep.  What is Spy Bubble?  Oh, it sounds cool, though.  It's a bubble.  Actually, me and Jimmy...  I can't even say it.  Spy, isn't it?  Dad.  Double agent.  You know, me and Jimmy do have a story.  Yeah?  Yeah, we do.  Iraq story?  No, but it's very similar to Spy Bubble. 
[02:02:00]  What'd you do?  Well, it's gotta be told carefully.  Fucking hot bitch.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Who's that girl?  I would make love to her.  Wow.  What is that?  I don't know.  I'm digging her.  She's on the Imus in the Morning program.  She's on the big screen.  Imus must be at the ranch.  Jimmy.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  We met a...  I was talking to a comedian one time.  This goes back a while.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Who had that on his...  Listen to this. 
[02:02:30]  He had that on his...  Wow.  Is that Carly?  Fucking digging the shit out of this one.  You know, I could get fucking TV girls.  I've done it before.  Well, go for that one.  Fuck them over, but...  I can't.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  No one likes me.  Oh, Jimmy.  Thank you.  This goes way back, and we gotta be very vague.  Yeah?  But we met a person that had a spy bubble program on his, we could say that much, his girlfriend's  phone, and kept complete tabs on her. 
[02:03:00]  Holy shit!  She knew every text she said.  Is it someone I know?  No.  No.  All right.  Then I don't care.  No one knows.  This goes back.  Wow.  Oh, we rock.  So when...  I don't know.  Completely illegal, by the way.  It's time to say it.  So when the girl was texting...  He knew.  You hearing this, Ann?  Wow!  Yeah!  So when the girl was texting, it went right to his phone.  Because he had suspicions.  Very...  Did it pay off?  Did he find out something... 
[02:03:30]  He would find out vague stuff, and then he would work that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  To keep her on the straight and narrow.  Straight and narrow?  But the thing is, unless it was blatant, what are you gonna do?  There were some things.  Was it blatant?  There were just some things.  Was she flirting?  I gotta keep your thing.  Was she being flirtatious?  Some things.  I don't remember.  I didn't know what the program was.  But every time...  Give me an example of a thing.  What's a thing that would be like, fuck, I...  Yeah, suspicions.  It paid off.  Did it pay off?  Did he find out something?  I think he said she had been talking to some people she shouldn't have, like an ex or something. 
[02:04:00]  I don't remember.  This is going...  I didn't know what the program was.  Fucking exes.  Yeah.  They always hone in.  But every time he...  Fucking guys.  This person or her texted, it went right to this other guy's phone.  Oh.  That's fucking nice.  Yeah.  What program is that?  That's not nice.  I think it's getyourgirlfriendstextonyourphone.com or...  No, it's not...  It might be the spy bubble.  It might be spy bubble.  Spy bubble?  Troy snuck out.  I guess he doesn't want...  He left.  Solve his issue with E-Rock like I did.  You win, E-Rock.  He's afraid of the heat. 
[02:04:30]  He fucking walked out.  Can't stay in the heat.  He got his ass out the kitchen.  Certainly did.  I think E-Rock just has it in him to take care of everybody around him.  Thank you, E-Rock.  You know what I see...  Some people would call that an enabler.  You know what I see just happened?  Yeah.  We dragged E-Rock in here to really crucify him about something, and there was really nothing  to bash him about.  What do you mean nothing?  He didn't really...  He didn't steal your phone.  Yeah, well...  And pictures.  I didn't really see anything.  And life.  Okay, now he's looking at me like I did something so wrong. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, what did Sam do?  What did Sam do?  Sam was being Sam.  Yeah.  I was asked my opinion.  I love that shirt.  No, you more like interjected into a conversation you weren't part of.  Big word.  Opie invited me into the conversation and asked me to give my opinion and analytical...  The mic wouldn't be on, E-Rock, if he wasn't supposed to be talking.  Right?  That's right.  He just forgot to turn it off.  Oh, shit! 
[02:05:30]  Why did Troy just walk out, and now he just walked by the window?  He likes to...  He's going over to his studio.  He's a...  You gotta keep in mind, he's a moron.  He's doing this thing.  Oh, there...  Troy's a moron?  Sam just called you a moron.  He just called you a moron.  Yeah.  You know what?  Because you gotta remember, he's a moron.  And he was talking about you walking past the window.  He did say that.  Well, because they moved on.  And then I can...  They yell at me for being in here when they're finished with me.  Who yells at you?  But me and...  You guys do.  No one...  I never yelled at Troy Kwan.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  Me and E-Rock solved our issue, and we want you guys to solve your issue.  Well, I'm going to be analytical here and interject.  What Troy Kwan is dumb, fucking hipster Instagrams?  I mean, I love him.  Is Troy good on Instagram?  It stinks.  I'm the Instagram king.  Are you good with Opie, E-Rock?  Posters on the street?  We're good, right, E-Rock?  I like Troy's street art.  Yeah, you like that?  Bob Kelly does good Instagram stuff.  I don't know how to do that.  Bob Kelly's an idiot.  A blithering.  He's a bag of shit.  Just filter the shit out of a picture.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what he does.  Then you got a Bob Kelly pic. 
[02:06:30]  I've gotten to the point where I could filter a picture in seconds now.  I know exactly what to do and make it look all bright and vivid.  But how many filters do you put it through?  I put it through like fucking five.  Wow, really?  It's like big, big, big, but I fucking do it fast, and it's like, ooh, it's so vivid and  nice and colorful.  Can you do it in one shot, or do you have to keep...  No, I gotta go through a few things.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  You know, brightness, and then the ambiance, and fucking saturate.  Just, you know what?  Saturate the shit out of your picture.  It looks great.  Looks great!  Or stand-urate. 
[02:07:00]  Sat or stand.  I get it.  You realize old school photographers?  Yeah.  We're fucking hacks.  They're done now.  If anyone could do it.  Done.  Holy fuck.  They just had those filters available to them a long time ago.  Yeah.  As we're sitting there with our dopey cameras.  Uh, Troy Kwan, your mixtape is called The Bonkers on Bathsalt.  Bonkers on Bathsalt, yep.  This one says The Bonkers.  Yeah, it's just the...  How do they get your mixtape?  Uh, on soundcloud.com slash Troy Kwan.  Nice. 
[02:07:30]  You can get it all there.  And you go with E-Rock stealing your shit?  Yeah, no, I...  Look, I have no problem with E-Rock.  I was just contributing because...  Do you agree, though, he likes to kind of, like, take care of everyone around him?  Well, Troy thinks it's blackmail.  That he feels close to?  Enabler.  I think...  You really think it's blackmail?  No.  I don't really believe that.  He just likes the information.  I don't think it's malicious.  I just think...  I mean, I don't think anybody could deny that E-Rock's a little sneaky.  Ooh.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Like, I don't think anybody...  I mean, am I...  Am I out of line by saying that?  Yes, you are, Troy.  A little.  Yes, you are.  A little.  E-Rock, sneaky, comment?  This has gone too far, E-Rock. 
[02:08:00]  E-Rock, do you have a comment that you'd like to say on the side of your mouth?  Sneaky, comment.  Defend yourself, please.  Poor you.  No, it's nothing new.  Troy, since he got hired here, has had nothing but problems with me.  No, no.  I had nothing but problems.  Bullshit.  Every time you walk in here and talk about me, it's you're shitting on me, trying to  throw me under the bus, or attack me for something.  It's never contributing to anything.  Not that it needs to be in a positive light, but that's the only reason you ever come in  is to go, hey, I'm going to shit talk him again.  And I've always told you, Eric, that whenever I say anything, fire back. 
[02:08:30]  Have I not said that to you?  Yeah, but I don't want...  I don't...  I'm not looking for attention from you.  What?  Well, I mean, if I'm taking shots at you, just fire back, dude.  Yeah, I do fire back, too.  I know, and it's great.  And now you've been firing back more.  Okay, you have another bit on the show there, Troy.  There you go.  What's my other bits?  Troy wants bits on the show.  What's my bit on the show?  Troy, bit on the show?  Comment?  You like bits on the show, Troy?  Yeah, I mean, whatever.  It's more like bits on the after show, but we're bringing it to us. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, shit.  What's wrong with having bits on the show?  On the main stage today.  Yep.  We all like the attention.  In the big boy room.  I've never been out of line with what I've said.  I mean, I've always told the truth of the situation.  See, that's not necessary.  A bit.  Bit.  Sam.  Sam puts a horse's bit up every time someone mentions a bit.  So, E-Rock, you're saying that Troy was nice to you before he got hired.  I'm still nice to you.  It's not necessarily like, I don't know, everything was really cool between me and him before he 
[02:09:30]  got hired, but since he got here and he feels more comfortable, he's like, oh, I'm just going  to dig into him.  Oh, man.  Because it seems like, oh, everyone else digs into him, so why can't I dig into him?  It's like the bit du jour.  Yes.  I've also dug into everybody.  I mean, everybody on the show.  Okay, fair enough.  Yeah.  Dug into.  I mean, Frank until or something.  Ope does change his wardrobe based on, you know, Troy's comments.  Whoa!  Why the fuck did I get you?  I didn't get admitted to that. 
[02:10:00]  I didn't get admitted to that, though.  What happened?  You were cool with him.  I'm pissed at Troy that I don't wear fucking sweatpants anymore because of Troy Kwan.  I did you a favor, man.  You did?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  I think it was more steep ladder telling me to pull my pants off.  That's not good.  Those ripped up sweats you had on.  I'm so mad.  Steve Blatt is just like, what are you doing?  I think he could see pubic hair.  Why did...  It was low.  Why did Troy say...  It's not on purpose.  I didn't realize.  Why did Troy basically say that it's inarguable that E-Rock is sneaky? 
[02:10:30]  That's why I don't understand.  Yeah.  I mean, I think you could ask anybody that works on the show.  Is Eric sneaky?  Does he do sneaky things?  Sal?  Comment.  Sal, comment.  Sneaky.  E-Rock, comment.  I'm in the same office with him.  Yes.  Oh!  Sneaky motherfucker!  What?  Wow!  Sneaky.  Give me a few seconds.  I'll think of something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just a sneaky vibe.  And Sam, I got a new problem with E-Rock.  What's that?  People are explaining what this whole ghost thing is.  Ghosting is where you fucking copy your entire hard drive. 
[02:11:00]  Did you ghost this whole hard drive?  Or in my case, my phone.  You ghosted it.  Comment.  Everyone's saying ghosting is exactly that.  And at the time, you did say it was a ghost program.  It was.  That retrieved my Oprah picture.  He did say that.  Shit.  It would be too tempting for him to not look at your pictures.  If you gave him the phone to pull something off of, it's too tempting for him to look  through it.  I don't think that's too crazy.  I think most of us have that in us to be a little kind of snoopy.  Here's my question.  What's the big hullabaloo?  Snoopy's one thing, but to save all that shit. 
[02:11:30]  And another thing is the sneaky thing.  Like, what has E-Rock done?  Is he a sneaky Pete?  You don't think that he's sneaky?  He does a little sneaky stuff?  E-Rock, you're known as sneaky.  I don't have any specific examples I can think of.  What do you think he's done that's sneaky?  You're sneaky.  He just does like little, like...  Like what?  Shoesie.  Oh, no.  Well, he just likes to be like, you know, mischievous, you know?  You like mischief, Eric?  Apparently, I do.  E-Rock, are you a busybody? 
[02:12:00]  No.  Are you a nosybody?  Are you a sneaky Pete?  Do you like to get into other people's business and know what's going on with everybody around  here?  I think he just wants to take care of people.  He's minding everybody's beeswax.  Yeah.  You don't mind your own beeswax, do you?  No, you're minding everybody else's beeswax.  You're minding everyone else's beeswax.  Your beeswax is all melted and everybody else's beeswax is all minded.  You're minding his own beeswax.  E-Rock's a very caring soul.  I think it's very innocent.  But Troy doesn't think so.  No, he thinks it's sneaky. 
[02:12:30]  You don't think so?  You think it's like for some shit down the road?  No, I don't know.  I think he just likes to have shit on deck.  What's crazy is that Sal thinks that E-Rock is sneaky.  Yeah.  I think you do too.  You're not admitting it this time.  I don't have any specific examples, but Troy's right.  Like Eric will.  And I think it's all in defense for himself.  It just has little tidbits of information that.  Information's power.  If needed at the right moment.  Yeah, yeah.  If it can be used.  Needed at the right moment.  I don't see it that way.  I really don't.  No, and it's all good. 
[02:13:00]  But where have I used this?  I'm good with E-Rock.  You haven't used it.  I'm trying to think of something, but.  Way to go.  Sam, is E-Rock sneaky?  Honestly.  Answer it honestly.  Is E-Rock sneaky?  Why are you smirking?  Why are you smirking like that?  Well, E-Rock, I don't know if sneaky is the right word.  Don't hold back.  You're not going to the party.  Well, I know.  He specifically had it a day he knew I wasn't going to be in town.  Yes.  I'm having a sleepover.  I do think that as much as, sometimes he doesn't think about what he's doing in the spirit of self-interest. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You know, like especially when it comes to the autograph and picture thing is where E-Rock gets a little sneaky sometimes.  Oh, okay.  We've seen that.  Oh, he'll slide in an extra thing or he'll say he's not getting anything and all of a sudden.  We've seen this before.  Sal's got one, Sal.  Sal?  Eric has a very selective way of asking Roland if he got anything in that day. 
[02:14:00]  Like, oh, did you get any DVDs?  Did you get any posters?  Because he has them right in front of him.  Did you get?  Oh!  Trying to get some of Roland's freebies.  Free shit.  And he'll go like, well, how many did you get?  And Roland will go, oh, four.  And he'll go, so where are they going?  Oh, one's going ant, one's going over, one's going down.  What?  Why would you ask him all that?  So are you here for the free shit?  Because if there was an extra, I would like to get one.  Oh, you're here for the free swag.  Why don't you just let?  R2?  Huh?  R2?  No, not really.  I really don't take a lot of the swag.  Let Roland offer it to you.  Fair enough.  It's the way in which he asks. 
[02:14:30]  It's not.  That backfired.  Because Sam really doesn't give a fuck.  No, I just leave shit here, books, fucking thing.  He's going to have no memory that he did radio.  Exactly.  He barely has any pictures or anything.  It's just going to be a fucking blur.  Right.  I got to ask you, do you have an Elijah Wood autograph?  Oh.  Yes.  And I'm willing to sign a contract that I will leave you alone for a month if I can have it.  Oh.  Is it personalized?  Eric, you're welcome to have it.  Fuck!  You were right here when it happened.  I know, I forgot, man.  My nephew is a huge Lord of the Rings fan, and if he could put a little poster in his room 
[02:15:00]  that is signed by Elijah Wood, I'd look like a fucking super uncle.  Yeah, but next time, he'll be back.  Special edition Lord of the Rings, where he's looking up.  What did you get last time?  That's the one I have.  What did you get him to sign last time?  It's great.  Is it signed?  Yeah.  It's hanging in my fucking, nice framed in my basement.  What did you get him to sign last time?  Yeah.  The, oh, because I didn't have a poster.  I had just the DVD.  You can't get him to sign stuff every time.  I don't even do that.  Eric, could you use your special ghost program to get me an Elijah Wood signed poster for my 
[02:15:30]  nephew?  Well, if you read the upcoming talent sheet and think ahead, you can get a poster.  Think ahead.  He's implying you're not on the talent sheet because he's calling you untalented.  Oh, man.  The talent sheet is where the guests are.  Oh, man.  I don't read that.  I don't know.  What do I know?  Come on.  I need an Elijah Wood.  I used to bring stuff in for people.  Oh.  And then sometimes it would be like, nobody won.  For the big auction that never happened.  Or the charity auction didn't happen.  The charity auction didn't happen.  What do you say, Jimmy?  What do you say? 
[02:16:00]  I don't remember that.  What do you say?  Oh, E-Rock.  Your agent has the records on that.  Huh?  Oh, what?  The charity auction didn't happen.  It did.  Not the second one that you were collecting stuff for.  No, because nobody would take the tax responsibility.  That's when you're collecting stuff for.  So when we were moving, we decided that day we would give everything away to the audience  that was there.  And that's what we did.  I don't know.  We emptied all those bills.  That sounds sneaky.  There's a lot of autographs that fell through the crack.  That sounds sneaky.  Someone sneaky peeting around.  Someone sneaky right there.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The E-Rock mansion.  Yeah.  Lots of signed stuff in that house.  You've seen it, Sid?  Oh, shit.  Because I know he's taking it down for the party.  Lots of signed stuff in that house.  I will be taking a photographic record of every autographed thing, and I will post them  all and see how sneaky you are.  God, you would have loved Eddie W, man.  Oh, my God.  It was so easy.  There was a lot of stuff to steal over there.  Plenty of swag.  Sam came across something from our past.  That was in my garage.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:17:00]  Hold on.  There's a poster coming in the studio.  Elijah Wood.  Oh.  Sign?  No, it's a Bryan Cranston's poster.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Bryan Cranston.  There it is.  Roland, how do I get an Elijah Wood poster?  Because I fucked up.  Do you need one?  I already know.  Your acting stinks.  What?  Oh, really?  Yeah, if you want to.  How?  My peeps.  I'll email you.  He's got ins.  Could you get the E-Rock poster signed?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we just got to order one.  A Lord of the Rings.  Elijah Wood.  Just order one, then I'll send it to the assistant. 
[02:17:30]  And he can personalize it, because we ain't selling it.  Yeah, no, I just, if you order one, I'll just send you his assistant.  E-Rock's Lord of the Ringdings.  See?  See what I did there?  All right.  Family.  You've had better.  So I know.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right, E-Rock.  I got him with you.  He's Lord of the Rings.  Lord of the Rings.  That's pretty good.  That's better.  Because he did it as Chip.  That's good.  That doesn't make no sense.  Oh.  I'll play it for it.  All right, well. 
[02:18:00]  I'm good with E-Rock.  I just want everyone to know.  Are you?  Okay.  No, I am.  I was confused, though.  That's all.  Yeah, lots of signed pictures and toys.  Tell them what you found.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  That's what I was getting.  Oh.  This is a little, you might find this to be a little sneaky.  Oh, okay.  If that's the right word.  I like that.  There's a piece of memorabilia in E-Rock's garage.  From K-Rock?  The Jägermeister machine.  Oh, I heard this on the after show. 
[02:18:30]  Is in E-Rock's garage.  Yes.  Why?  Wow.  I have a couple of Opie and Anthony posters I'll give you.  Like, old ones I don't want.  You will take them.  I know you will.  They'll give them away on Twitter.  Wow.  You wound up getting the Jäger machine.  Oh, we were told at that point that they had to leave the facility.  Why is it in your garage?  Because I threw it in my car and took it home.  No, I mean, why don't you plug it in and hook it up?  Oh, we'll be ready for the party.  Ah.  It's being cleaned right now.  Very nice.  Why the fuck did we ever get rid of that machine?  I don't know.  I would like to say, for the record, ask Ralphie Mae.  Oh, God. 
[02:19:00]  Sometimes E-Rock's sneaky.  Like, E-Rock is nice to us with his sneakiness.  I don't think he's that.  Because, like, when K-Rock was flipping formats and moving and taking everything off the wall.  Uh-huh.  Like, E-Rock and me, definitely, you know.  Oh, you delved into some of the memorabilia.  Well, it just would have ended up in someone else's house.  When they take the doors off the offices and all the furniture is gone except stuff laying on the floor,  you kind of think it's up for grabs.  Well, sure.  E-Rock and me had a two-man operation going on.  It's sneaky. 
[02:19:30]  There's a reason why I have a Rob Zombie gold record now.  Oh, shit.  So you're good with him, too.  Yeah.  I'm good with E-Rock.  Guess what I mean about E-Rock?  He's always taking care of people.  E-Rock is very thoughtful.  But sneaky, too.  It's hard to hate him.  Yeah, yeah.  But sneaky.  No, it's not.  You don't find it?  Hard to hate him, no.  He's kind like a retard.  You know, retards are kind and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not freaking at him.  It's not an insult.  Abitards are kind.  They're very kind.  They're smiling. 
[02:20:00]  But so stupid.  Having fun.  E-Rock wants everyone to be okay.  Yeah.  He really does.  Yeah.  Do you?  Just be okay.  Must be a weird feeling.  All he wants to do is tend the rabbits.  Wow.  E-Rock, mice and men.  It's like an hour you've been fucking just in the barrel.  Yeah, slow news day.  It's all right, yeah.  Slow news day, no guess.  Slow news day.  Oh, shit.  That's not fair.  Oh, shit.  That's really not fair.  Why?  You knew going into break we were fucked and I was going to pull something out of my ass.  This is what I pulled out of my ass.  I'll be honest.  Oh, E-Rock.  It is a slow news day, you motherfucker. 
[02:20:30]  You do have Scott and Todd audio there for you.  Oh, that's good.  You motherfucker.  That works.  He's absolutely right.  See, on slow news days, I would hide if I was you.  Yeah, you should really know.  You're the go-to guy when it's a slow news day.  It is true.  Somewhere Gary is like, thank God for E-Rock.  Fuck Gary.  Why would you knock him on?  There's no reason.  We used Lord of the Onion Rings before.  Oh, we did.  Yeah, we did.  Conway Tweety.  With a K, by the way.  It's kind of funny, though.  I like the Conway Tweety. 
[02:21:00]  Conway Tweety.  He's a good man.  Spam's birthday today.  Are you psyched?  Who's?  Spam.  Oh, man.  There's a Spam girl.  She's pretty cute, the Spam girl.  I like that.  You like Spam, E-Rock?  No.  No?  Spam stinks.  Spam's terrible.  It's just all jelly.  Fry it up and put it on a Sambo.  I wouldn't even know it's all jelly.  Spam tastes horrible.  Yeah?  I've had it.  It's awful.  Would you have a Spam donut?  You slice it and then fry it.  It just tastes like awful.  What was it made for?  Poor people?  It's made for poor people. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, it was like an equivalent of a government handout.  But even when we were poor, we didn't fucking go spam.  It's spiced ham.  That's where spam comes from.  We would cook up the spiced ham.  We would cook up the snappers I would catch in Centiport.  Yeah?  Is that it?  Bunker fucking that you'd pick out of the pond?  Bunker's brutal.  Poodle pond.  Snapper, though.  We'd cook that shit up.  Why don't they show the Spam girl?  She was kind of cute.  I want to see the Spam girl.  She's on Fox News.  And she looked a little chunky, though. 
[02:22:00]  They shouldn't have a fat Spam girl.  It's not really selling the product well.  Cheddar cheese eggs.  Look at her.  Dipping it in some shit.  What are those, Spam fucking egg rolls?  Yeah, Spam can make anything.  Who's this?  Who are you?  She's talking.  Oh, I thought you were somebody else.  He is, but he doesn't give it up right away.  No, he really doesn't.  He just keeps talking, and we don't know what character it is.  He'll give it up, though.  Yeah.  When he's ready.  All right, enough showing the Spam. 
[02:22:30]  Show the blonde, you fuckwad.  You can make anything out of Spam.  Salsa, we've got Chi-Chi, jalapenos, House of Sang, teriyaki.  Who are you?  That's the lady.  She makes things out of Spam.  Who are you?  Just talking.  What are you doing here?  Why would you tell her?  I think the character is still in development.  Oh, is that what it is?  In development?  Shit.  I don't know what that is.  Yeah.  I'm Spam boy.  I don't know what I hear.  Spam boy.  He's dripping Spam juice on his suit.  You adult. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, you want to hear from a therapist?  About what?  E-Rock?  Oh, yes.  Oh, that is a good idea.  You want to hear from the rapist?  The rapist.  I get it.  Benny Hill did that joke first.  Therapist?  The rapist.  It was like a sign that said, the rapist on the door.  And he came out and fixed it.  It was therapist.  We got to talk about Daniel Tosh.  Yes.  All right.  He talked about rape and a joke and some bitch.  Of course.  Someone in the audience.  Of course.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they?  Fucking content.  Did you read the blog, though? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, but who cares?  Get the blog, because I want to read the blog.  And Louis C.K. came to his defense there.  Right.  Said he was very funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for Louis.  We feel the exact same way.  Tosh did nothing wrong.  I'm just tired of defending comedians, because none of them would ever defend me.  Exactly.  But I do like Tosh.  You're right.  Yeah, but it's like the radio guys.  I defend all of them.  Yeah.  Even though they're scum bags.  I fucking hate them all, but in the end, I fucking have defended every single one of them.  It doesn't matter.  People on radio that are sneaky.  Whatever.  You defend them.  Right.  I'm good with all of them.  Oh, you rock. 
[02:24:00]  Sam, I'm good with all radio guys.  He's good.  All radio guys.  All radio guys.  Here's the problem.  Most of them are not good with you.  I don't care.  Like the guy you went to college with.  I had to work it out in my own mind.  Man Cow?  Oh, that he bashed?  Yeah, that we jacked over.  I'm not good with Man Cow.  I'm good with Man Cow.  I fucking called his show.  He loved that show.  He was a great fucking caller.  I'm not good with Man Cow.  I was one of the best callers.  He stinks.  Ever.  Yeah.  Steve, the therapist from Connecticut.  You've been on our show before.  Good morning, boys.  Yeah.  The answer is cock.  It's how do you relax yourself?  You pacify yourself with it. 
[02:24:30]  Hi, sir.  Given all the shit that you make E-Rock eat, I mean, you were the guy who left him at  a concert to walk home.  I don't remember that.  What happened, Sam?  It wasn't 100% your doing.  But if I remember, you guys.  You should have known better.  What?  You went to the Rolling Stones?  Was that the show?  Rolling Stones, yeah.  Yeah.  And what happened?  Why did we bring this up?  It was where?  Giant Stadium?  Is that right?  Giant Stadium?  At the time, it was hilarious. 
[02:25:00]  And Opie and their date got into the car.  What?  And instead of waiting for Eric.  Did I drive that day?  Yes, you did.  Is Darth Vader on the fucking phone?  Decided to drive away.  Someone influenced me that day.  Let E-Rock figure out his own way home.  And I, at the time, thought it was hilarious.  How long did it take you to get home?  At the time, it was.  Well, considering I didn't know New Jersey at that point. 
[02:25:30]  But you could see the city from the stadium.  Yeah, but you don't have a car.  How are you going to get there?  Walk.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, there's a ripper in the way.  So then you have to wait on a bus line that goes almost around the entire venue.  You get on the bus, get to Port Authority, and I had to go back to my apartment in Brooklyn.  So you'd have never known this.  Waiting for a subway that only comes once an hour.  All right.  So get back to Brooklyn, get my stuff, get back, and then come into work. 
[02:26:00]  All right, so my joke was good.  That meant it was an hour.  An hour?  You were inconvenienced for an hour.  I got home about 3 a.m.  When did you realize that, like, when you first got there, when did you realize they weren't coming back?  Because, like, that joke, that's like a joke where...  Why do we bring up old shit?  But that's like a joke where you drive around the block and then you come back.  Well, he got even because he sent Opie a spam email.  So even Steven right there. 
[02:26:30]  Sam, by the way, as far as this incident, I'm good with Iraq.  You're good with that.  Yeah, I'm good with it.  Iraq, he's good with you.  I'm good.  It's all good now.  So there you go, Eric.  Don't worry about it.  I got over it.  Dilemma over.  Steve, what do you got?  Well, if you look in a personnel form at Iraq's job title, it must be Bayonet Dummy.  And as such, given the way he's been treated over time, I couldn't help but think that there's some sort of evil and diabolical intent on his computer backing up behavior of everybody else's files. 
[02:27:00]  Diabolical?  Diabolical.  I know.  I was doing Bugs Bunny.  Is there evil intent?  Do you hate everybody here?  No.  Steve is saying you're devious.  He hears that you're devious through this whole thing.  Steve, why do you think he's being devious and, like, sneaky?  And you're a therapist.  Well, he's beholden to you guys to have a job, so he's got to take his assigned role as scapegoat. 
[02:27:30]  What are you beholden?  Yeah, who is he?  William Beholden?  Tag teaming, motherfucker.  Jesus, with the language.  Steve, do you agree that he's kind of an enabler?  Very tough for me to say.  And that he's trying to take care of everyone around him that he cares about.  Well, yes, I do.  Enablers often fall into the role of having to be passive-aggressive because they can't appropriately assert themselves and get their needs met.  He's like the, what is that called, catcher in the ham and Swiss on rye? 
[02:28:00]  That was a stretch, bro.  I was getting old.  You've done that one, too.  Oh, I have?  Yeah.  Fucking E-Rock remembers them all.  He remembers everything about sandwiches.  All right.  Yes, he does.  That's true.  You're right.  I did remember kind of doing that.  If he starts wearing a black trench coat into work, guys, I would do that.  Oh, sure.  Would you ever join the trench coat mafia?  No.  Yes.  Did we do Fifty Shades of Grey Poupon?  Eric Kleebold.  We do that one, E-Rock? 
[02:28:30]  I don't remember.  No.  No?  That one I don't remember.  If not, it was worth doing.  It was all right?  Oh, yeah.  Steve?  Catcher in the pizza pie?  Yes, sir.  What's the 511 tactical bag that you like so much?  You're always talking about it.  Oh, my God.  Just go to 511.com and look in their luggage section.  It's a carry-on bag.  It's wonderful.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Is it a duffel or a suitcase?  No, it's like a carry-on suitcase.  Oh, okay.  It's a little suitcase, a roller suitcase that fits in the overhead. 
[02:29:00]  I use it all the time.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Well, Troy has given up on the show again.  Oh, Troy.  Are you there?  Troy.  Are you good with E-Rock?  Everyone's good with E-Rock.  Everyone's great with E-Rock.  I'm fine with E-Rock.  We're all fine with E-Rock.  See, we're all good with E-Rock.  Good.  Until the next slow news day.  People like to bust his balls a little bit, but...  What do you mean, people?  You.  I don't bust his balls, but I tell him to bust my balls back.  You know, Troy's New Year's resolution was to leave E-Rock alone.  No, and I've been good.  He failed.  No, I've been good.  I've been a lot better than I was.  And I'll sign a contract a month where I don't touch you, man. 
[02:29:30]  You know, I wouldn't abuse you.  You want to make a resolution to not fuck with him?  Well, because it's so easy.  It really is.  It's like if you're a smoker, you know, giving up that stuff that is tough to give up.  There's so much to goof on.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  That right there is an insult.  I mean, there is.  I mean...  Give me five.  Five.  Well, so much.  Five should be...  Give me five.  I don't know if I should mention half of them on the air.  Oh, really?  Well...  What's the five, though?  If you had to.  Okay.  There was a gun to your head. 
[02:30:00]  Let me think about that.  I hope he's the fucking boss, Troy.  Oh, shit.  You have to listen to him.  So what...  Should I not do the obvious?  Oh.  Because the obvious is wait.  No, don't do that.  Don't do that.  Do another five.  That's just hurtful.  But he's not even that big.  And it's hack at this point.  No, man.  It is hack.  You're right.  Not from you guys.  Just other people jumping in.  Oh.  But it is hack.  You're right.  There's the enabling thing that Steve brought up.  Yeah.  Passive aggressive.  Yep.  Yep.  He wanted to slam his neck.  He's getting very passive aggressive now, lately.  My try button reeks. 
[02:30:30]  What?  Nothing.  My belly button.  Oh, you're smelling your belly button?  Yeah.  Did you come in it?  Yeah.  It goes down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what are the five things, Troy?  I think we'll move on from that.  Don't be a fucking stickman.  But he's not even that heavy.  How much do you weigh, Iroh?  300 what?  232.  What?  That means you're 242.  242.  No.  All right.  242.  And how tall are you?  5'11".  See, it's not that bad.  Yeah, but how much did you weigh when you first started working here? 
[02:31:00]  187.  Wow.  Okay.  So there's a difference.  Jesus.  Crazy.  I could go down this road, but I'm not going to.  What road?  Classy.  What road?  Well, because I'm trying to...  My New Year's resolution is to not goof on him as much.  No.  Because it's such an easy road to go down.  Oh, we just asked you to name five things.  Can we all say how much we've gained since starting here?  Yeah.  I've gained 20.  Since starting where?  I've gained 20.  Since starting where?  Like XM?  Satellite.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Satellite?  I went from like 162 to 182.  I don't know what I am, but I'm not as heavy as I was on Tough Crowd.  So I'm lighter, but I was lighter in 2007.  I think I'm the same.  I have some old photos I can give you if you want.  Oh!  Passive aggressive.  Where did he get those?  See?  Let me tell you.  Ant's in better shape, though, now.  Maybe you were heavier than Ant.  I might have been.  I was too thin, though.  I can lose a few.  I got more muscle than a fat these days.  I went down the way.  All the way.  I went anorexic. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, man.  When we got fired?  Holy fuck.  I was down to one.  Yeah, not good.  Anyway.  All right, boys.  I'm punching out.  Have a good day.  All right, Steve.  Way to fuck up this whole bit.  Fucking breathing like an ant.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  The guy hit a truck.  Dude.  Oh, Joe!  Holy shit.  He's watching a guy go off the road.  Whoa, it's down an embankment.  Look at the shadow under the car.  That's fucking starskying.  That rocks. 
[02:32:30]  Wow.  Why did that happen?  Did he hit that house?  I don't know, but he definitely fucking went off an embankment.  Yeah.  That's fucking cool.  You know the tanker gas station video?  Yeah.  Did you see that he went between two cars, too?  Oh, when he was a runaway tanker.  Yeah.  But he split the two cars.  He got right in the middle, so he didn't take those out, and then he landed, like, as  we all know now, feet away from the gas pumps?  Just short of the gas pumps.  I didn't see the two, like, minivans he went in between, too. 
[02:33:00]  Fucking crazy.  All right, E-Rock.  We're good.  E-Rock, we're all good?  Everything's cool now?  You got 45 minutes.  Anything else you want to dig up?  No, we got material now.  Yeah.  So you're good today.  Now we got some shit.  But slow news days, I would fucking just hide.  That was our E-Rock break.  He did call me out on that, and he's accurate about that.  We had to find something.  But, E-Rock, it did start with something legit, that you, you know, take his pictures.  You stole them.  You're sneaky. 
[02:33:30]  Underhanded.  Troy's New Year's resolution.  Yeah.  Give me a...  I need the Elijah Wood badly.  Elijah Wood?  I need an autograph rolling.  Yeah.  Could you get the poster and everything for me?  I'm too lazy to get that, even.  Give me the money.  All right.  I like Mello E-Rock, though.  He used to be so, like, on his toes and be like,  No, I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  No, I didn't.  Now he just sits there and goes,  Yeah, whatever.  Just go fuck yourself.  In the beginning of this conversation, he was getting pretty heated.  Yeah, he was pretty mad.  Yeah, he said he was hot when he said, 
[02:34:00]  How you doing?  He said, warm.  He's warming up.  But know why?  He knows there's no future here.  So it doesn't matter anymore.  In his life?  No, he's got...  Oh.  That's not necessary.  It really wasn't.  You're right.  That was all encompassing.  I was just talking about his career.  I apologize.  Yeah, I used to think it was very funny when I was young.  Instead of necessary, I would say necessary celery.  That is funny.  That's not funny.  I was young.  Explain to Iraq what celery is.  That's not necessary either.  It's the opposite of biary.  It's got peanut butter in it.  I can't wait to go to the house, though. 
[02:34:30]  I want to see the nagle stage.  I will say this.  My wife will be very happy to hear that.  I want to go.  I want to see the fucking...  She's a nice place.  I want to go, but we can't.  Iraq is a good host.  And he's not a great host because he invites everybody over, specifically when Jim and  me are out of town on purpose.  Well, maybe you guys are fucking assholes.  Is that right?  I'm a very good party guest.  Yeah, you are.  And I'm the life of the party.  Jimmy is a good guest.  And I've learned from Jimmy going to other places what to have there because he wasn't 
[02:35:00]  happy with the treats that you had at your house.  What?  I'm always happy with Anthony's treats.  Oh my God.  No, I've had to step up my treat.  Anthony's house is fucking treat central.  At the beginning, the first time he went out, I learned real quick.  He was not happy with stale pretzels and sticky beer floor.  And fucking lukewarm fucking hot tub.  Gazpacho hot tub.  Gazpacho tub.  No, now the jacuzzi can cook lobsters in it.  And I put out so much shit.  Hard not to eat it.  And then he came over and he kept eating everything. 
[02:35:30]  Who?  Bob Kelly.  Bobby.  And I had to go to the fridge.  Sofa.  I had to go to the fridge and start pulling out shit and heating it up in the microwave.  I want Bobby not to kill the messenger, but I did get a tweet overnight.  And someone said that Bob Kelly's starting to look like George the Animal Steel.  Don't kill me.  Oh boy.  And then someone sent the pictures.  Oh my God.  We got to get Bobby back.  We got to get him back.  I agree.  We got to get him back.  I found some old UFC pictures from 2008.  The last time Bobby and I went to Vegas. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  And he definitely put some money.  But he's in the gym a lot.  Him and Keith Robinson are doing that boxing.  All right.  Keith looks really good and Bobby's been going.  He's losing some too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to lose more weight.  Yeah.  It's faster too.  Come on now.  Step it up.  All right.  Well, between everybody tweeting and texting.  I guess we'll, Iraq, why don't you take us to break?  Uh.  He's in here.  No, don't just. 
[02:36:30]  Sal's got it to us.  Point at Sal.  Why don't you run in there and just take us a break?  We'll wait.  How about.  That'll go well.  Who does.  We'll give you the last word.  Oh.  Oh.  It's Bill O'Reilly after he beats the shit out of you.  Yeah.  So we'll give you the last word.  Look, I'll even turn everyone's mic off.  Oh, that's good.  I'm gone.  Ant's gone.  Jim's gone.  Sam's gone.  I'm gone.  And even Troy.  I'm off.  You get the last word.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  I wish one of your guys had children if I could kick them in their fucking head or stomp on their testicles. 
[02:37:00]  On Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I wanted to give a big fuck you to Troy Kwan.  Busted a nut and then someone was on my hand and I licked it and now I know what my juice tastes like.  So fuck you, Troy Kwan.  Fuck you.  Hey, I want to give a big fat fuck you to Suffolk County, New York.  These motherfuckers are adding a hundred more red light cameras out here, but they're not putting any in the handker. 
[02:37:30]  What's the matter?  Rich people don't pass red light?  Fuck you, dumb baby.  Fuck you.  This FU goes out of Kevin.  I went home last night, watched a little workaholics on Comedy Central.  Lo and behold, they were celebrating half Christmas.  You fucking poser.  Fuck you.  Fuck these motherfucking cocksucked motherfuckers who's been coming all over the fucking top of the toilet paper rolls in the fucking bathrooms. 
[02:38:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  Fuck you.  I want to give this big FU to Opie Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, which is, isn't this great?  That's all my wife does now when she comes home from work.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give an average size FU to my wife and kids.  First year out of 15 that I didn't get fireworks, put off a giant sleigh. 
[02:38:30]  Big FU to them.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Drew Boogie.  Your song's stuck in my head.  Fuck Drew Boogie.  Best song ever.  Fuck Drew Boogie.  Fuck you, Drew Boogie.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  You're worthless and weak.  I carried an M16 and you, you carry that, that, that guitar. 
[02:39:00]  Who are you?  Where do you come from?  Who do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me?  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  What do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me? 
[02:39:30]  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  You are a disgusting slob.  Stand up straight.  Touching the turds.  You are a disgusting slob.  Just let the buckle title shoot.  What kind of a man are you?  You do nothing.  You are nothing.  What kind of a man are you? 
[02:40:00]  You do nothing.  You are nothing.  What do you want to do with your life?  Are you listening to me?  Tell me.  What do you want to do with your life?  Do you understand?  What do you want to do with your life?  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:40:30]  Ah.  So we got Scott and Todd audio.  What is this about?  E-Rock could have saved an hour and a half if he got this stuff for us earlier.  I know.  A little quicker.  And we got the Voss and Bonnie clip.  Rich Voss coming in tomorrow.  And Daniel Tosh.  And Daniel Tosh.  I just tweeted basically saying completely support the guy for being a comic in a comedy club. 
[02:41:00]  Period.  Even if it's rape jokes.  Sorry.  Did he apologize?  Yeah, he did.  Why?  He has a lot to lose.  Why?  Why did we apologize?  Yeah, he has a lot to lose.  We didn't want to apologize.  But he's the guy that does that stuff.  He's not a pussy, though.  Tosh is a pretty edgy show.  Yeah.  But he really just fucking...  When you got millions on the line and you just got to say you're sorry to some cunt.  And I think apologizing is okay these days because everyone knows it's fake bullshit.  It means nothing.  It means absolutely nothing.  So now I feel like it's fine if you have to save your stupid gig. 
[02:41:30]  If Comedy Central comes and goes, look, they replay his show all the time.  The one joke in a comedy club is...  Because it's not some big artistic statement he made.  It was just a dumb, off-the-cuff thing.  And like every comedian, he's being edgy and he's fucking saying that he's making fun of rape.  Because it's...  If you sat Tosh down and said, do you think rape is a funny thing?  He'd go, no, of course.  It's a terrible thing.  Right.  That's the challenge for a comedy.  When you're on stage, a different story.  You take...  And I will apologize for child molesting jokes when Kevin Bacon apologizes for playing a child molester. 
[02:42:00]  Ah.  This is why the public are such fucking twats.  Because never are actors asked to apologize for roles they play.  They can address anything they want artistically.  But as a comedian, if you address it artistically, these fuckheads think it's okay to blog about it and that you should be punished for it.  They've never...  What it is...  Why is that?  The public are cunts.  Sorry I'm yelling.  But that's what it is. 
[02:42:30]  And that's where comics and radio guys are very similar.  Yeah.  Because the stuff we say, we're trying to entertain our people as a show.  Imus was trying to entertain that day.  I know we always go back to Imus, but that changed a lot of shit.  That day, Imus was just trying to be funny and entertain his audience.  Period.  And if you sat Imus down, he would explain that.  Yeah.  And Pacino, by the way, one of his best roles, Scarface, has he ever had to come out and apologize for that?  Right.  And I guess making fun of something, they're going to say, portrays it in a different light. 
[02:43:00]  Fuck you.  I care, yeah.  Pacino...  And again, I love Scarface, but that...  Every drug dealer...  I mean, the Mexican cartel guys have fucking Scarface pictures.  They love them.  In their house.  Right.  This guy, he portrayed drug dealers to a way that makes drug dealers feel amazing.  And not once has Pacino ever been asked to apologize for that.  But man, if you're a comedian and you make light of rape or fucking a child, you're a terrible person. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  Yeah.  The fucking public is just shitty.  And I mean, a small segment of them...  But that small segment has a massive voice.  But it's an act, and why should an act that's comedy be any different than an act that's drama?  You're right.  It makes no sense.  And I read this broad...  It made no sense.  It made no sense.  I read her blog, and basically she was out there in L.A. with a friend, and they're like,  yeah, what do you want to do tonight?  Ah, let's go see some comedy.  They go to the Laugh Factory, they see Dane Cook, and basically go, well, he wasn't really  a cup of tea, but we dealt with it. 
[02:44:00]  And then Daniel Tosh came on, and he had a rape joke, so this stupid lady had to fucking pipe up.  But this is what happened.  And what did she say exactly?  She said, like, rape isn't funny, or he was making fun of rape saying it's always funny.  He was being over-the-top and sarcastic.  Right.  He was taking what a comedian will do sometimes, such a ridiculous point of view that no rational  person could think that he means it.  Right.  Right.  That's when it becomes funny.  That's the part of that that's funny.  It's so over-the-top, it's funny.  And not to tear down a wall, but we do that very thing here on our show. 
[02:44:30]  Of course we do.  And a bunch of radio guys that have gotten in a lot of fucking trouble and lost their  gigs did the exact same thing, too.  Over-the-top shit to make you go, whoa!  Yes.  That's something you don't hear every day.  I hate to break it down for people, but the three stooges really didn't hit each other  with wrenches.  What?  It started with that, you think?  Ruining it.  Spoiler alert.  The point is, that's a...  Yeah, really, man.  That's a violent act.  To cave somebody's head in with a wrench is a violent act. 
[02:45:00]  But we all laughed at it.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious because it's slapstick.  Because no one could survive that in real life.  Well, rape is a horrible thing.  The idea of slapstick, in a way, is different now.  But to me, that is a verbal form of slapstick.  It is being so over-the-top.  Yeah.  And again, I'm not shitting on Tosh for apologizing.  Because again, if I was in his position, he does a very edgy show.  Yeah.  He's a real comic.  Look, man, the pressure got to be a lot.  And it's not worth throwing everything away to make a statement about a dumb, off-the-cuff 
[02:45:30]  joke you do in a comedy club.  Right.  So I don't blame him.  And if I was in his shoes like Tracy...  Make an apology.  Yeah.  But fuck her.  Fuck her for being sensitive.  If you don't think Tosh's jokes are funny, that's acceptable.  Yeah.  Don't laugh.  Right.  But to have to stand up and go, rape jokes aren't funny.  Really?  To you.  But when you went to see Star Wars in the theater, did you really stand up and go,  oh, it's not appropriate to cut somebody in half with a lightsaber?  Why is that okay?  Because it's different than comedy. 
[02:46:00]  I don't get it.  Comedy has to be based in, like, the truth.  I don't know what it is either.  It doesn't make any sense.  Why do people think their opinions...  Well, it doesn't have to be based...  They think it has to be.  They think it does.  I know.  That's what's scary is when they're...  Now they're going into comedy clubs and getting comics in trouble.  That is so fucking scary and people just, ah, with a...  No, it's not a...  This is bad.  Pick your fucking wide, flat ass up and leave the comedy club, you bitch.  He was in your cup of tea, as they say. 
[02:46:30]  So get your fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get out of there.  I had a thing in the cellar one night where I fucking brutalized some woman who was being  a cunt and she was talking during my act.  And there was a female reporter from The Post who, in fairness to her, the article she wrote  about it, she did quote me accurately and she printed my explanation.  I remember we read it.  So I did appreciate that.  She didn't lie.  But I could tell by the tone of the overall article, she did not love what I said. 
[02:47:00]  And I did answer her email.  And if I didn't answer her email, I'm glad I would have just had her tone in there.  But she did, in fairness, but this was somebody who heard the set and saw it totally different.  And meanwhile, I remember the moment.  The woman was being a cunt.  I shut her up.  I tried to even be playful with her.  I wasn't mad at her.  Right.  Yeah.  And then her fucking jerk-off boyfriend, her fucking pussy-whipped husband, had to pipe  up.  And so I smashed him.  Nice.  People don't understand because you're such entitled fucks and you're so used to nobody 
[02:47:30]  telling you about yourselves.  When you heckle in a comedy club, the gloves come off.  Right.  And you have begged somebody to attack you.  Right.  Verbally.  Not physically.  We understand.  There's nothing worse than when you heckle and then get wounded when somebody brutalizes  you, you fucking dummies.  What do you think you're going up against?  But just the idea that you think it's okay for you to be rude and talk.  With impunity.  With impunity.  Yeah.  God, people are such, that's because when they complain at work, their complaints are 
[02:48:00]  heard.  I don't like that American flag out there.  We'll look into that.  You take it down.  I don't like that American flag.  The Homeowners Association.  Now what's happened is people are so used to their complaints being taken seriously that  when they heckle or talk in a comedy club, they think that they have the right to-  Not funny.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Here's something funny.  You're a cunt.  Do you know how many sets I've thrown away being barbaric?  I love it. 
[02:48:30]  I'll never forget some guy in the audience.  I was on stage at the cellar and I was working out a clean set.  It was for, it might have been a Letterman set or Kimmel or whatever it was.  I wasn't cursing and this fucking dummy with his dumb wife and dumb daughters was sitting  there and he goes, there are ladies present.  There are, first of all, there are in porn too.  Fucking asshole.  But that means nothing to me, but I smashed him.  Oh, good.  As I pointed out, I'm working on a TV set I haven't cursed once. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  You know what Jimmy Wells said, man.  I just hate them.  Oh my God.  What did he fucking say?  I don't remember what he did, but I know that I smashed him.  And in fairness, if you paint the comeback properly, if you structure it, and I was talking  in an interview once about how I don't like to leave people exits, meaning people like  to be offended, people like to be hurt, so if you're going to address harsh shit, I like  to set it up in advance.  A lot of people have heard me do stuff, like, well, when you're on stage, you go like something 
[02:49:30]  like, yeah, I talk about people who are offended.  I used to do a bit on how much I hate people who are offended at work, and they're fucking  seeking attention, and people in the audience go, ah, they hate it too.  Right, right, right.  So you start off with that.  You kind of build this cocoon we're all in.  We all hate people who get offended.  Cocoon.  Because I know what's, I know what's coming.  There's pedophilia stuff around the corner, but what I've done is I've kind of brought  everybody into the room and said, don't we hate people who are offended?  Yeah.  So now, it's hard for them to object because they've already signed off. 
[02:50:00]  So, you know, you kind of have to sometimes do that.  But Tosh is a seasoned enough comic where he knows what he's doing on stage.  Right, yeah.  And that woman was out of line.  She fucking piped up.  And he did what he should have done, which he shouldn't have been gentle with her.  No.  He smashed her.  He smashed this bitch.  Yep.  Smashed her.  But he's a smart guy.  She should have just quietly left if it wasn't her.  Exactly.  She should have just left.  Period.  Sorry.  And just said, that's not for me.  You know, Jimmy's Sandusky stuff is fucking hilarious and brilliant. 
[02:50:30]  Thank you.  I don't condone kid fucking.  Sure.  But I laughed my ass off.  Absolutely.  I think it's horrendous what happens to children out there.  And by the way, why is it?  But I could separate the two.  I don't understand why people can't do that.  And even those that can't, why do they feel like they need to be heard?  You're not a performer.  So why do you need to be heard?  And what is worse, making fun of pedophilia or Kevin Bacon, who did a great job in The Woodsman,  but he did a real portrayal of a kid fucker. 
[02:51:00]  Like, he shows you, he in a way, humanized a kid fucker.  He's a genius for that.  But he was great at it.  But we, we look at that like, wow, that was a really good role.  Yeah, why is it different?  Why is that acceptable in the eyes of the public?  Why are actors never fucking attacked?  And I don't want to hear, well, comedy's based in truth, or comedy is your thoughts.  Because let's just say you wrote the movie.  Or let's just say somebody wrote you the joke and you did it.  So I don't want to hear that shit.  And by the way, on Twitter, all you fucking assholes that get offended on Twitter at a joke I make, like a rape joke. 
[02:51:30]  How about this?  If I do a rape joke, people who follow me know the type of comedian I am and know who they're following.  So they should unfollow me if they object to something I say.  Easy as that.  But if you read what I say off a retweet, hey, scumbag, yell at the person who retweeted it.  You're following them.  So you should know who you're following.  Don't yell at me, motherfucker. 
[02:52:00]  What a great fucking point.  I didn't bring it to your house.  Like if somebody says to you and tells you a really racist joke, two Puerto Ricans and Jews and do this.  Are you going to hunt down the person that wrote that joke?  No.  You're mad at the person who fucking told it to you.  Don't be mad at me because somebody retweeted me.  Someone that, yeah, because they never would have seen, they never would have seen your tweet.  But then they see the guy that they, and that's what's happening here.  Everyone is outraged at Daniel Tosh and they weren't even in the comedy club.  Be mad at the person who told you the joke. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Daniel Tosh said that joke to a small group of people.  I Twitter to a group of people who have chosen to follow me.  Yeah.  If they retweet me, well then you should be mad that you've chosen.  At the retweet guy.  Because they are retweeting the joke.  So be mad at them and unfollow them.  Right.  Don't tell me.  I don't give a fuck.  The beauty of having a mediocre career is there's nothing they can take from me.  Right.  What are they going to do, fire me from radio because of my Twitter?  Tough shit.  Right. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, so she piped up.  Great point.  And then Daniel Tosh said, wouldn't it be hilarious if, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, she got raped on a fucking, yeah.  Right here and now or something.  Yeah.  And then she left and tried to get her money back.  I'm surprised they didn't give her money back.  Well, they apologized.  No, they did.  I think they offered her tickets to another show.  Yeah.  And the bottom line is they apologized.  They shouldn't have done that at the Laugh Factory.  They should have said, look, we're sorry you didn't have a good time.  Right.  But this is what happens.  But this is what we do.  This is what happens in a comedy club. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  It's funny how nobody's ever complained after a band is on stage and somebody starts screaming  at, like, you know, you'll catch someone in the audience doing something fucked up.  And they'll stop shows.  Paul Stanley from Kiss did it because some asshole.  Axl Rose has done it.  And these guys that will scream at some dickhead in the audience.  Yeah.  And the artist is right to do it.  People don't leave and go, I want my money back.  They weren't singing at that moment.  Yeah.  They're like, what a cool moment that was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, ugh, I just, I hate the way people think that they should have input into stand-up. 
[02:54:00]  You shouldn't.  Sit, enjoy the show, or don't enjoy it.  And if you don't, fucking leave.  Okay, this, I don't even know what this dumb woman's name is, by the way.  Of course, she's just some fucking fat blogger, I'm sure.  But this is, uh, go to the top, Sam.  Oh, it's just about, she's at the comedy club, whatever, and she talks about dick.  So she says, she says Tosh starts making, uh, some very generalizing declarative statements  about rape jokes always being funny.  How can a rape joke not be funny?  Rape is hilarious, et cetera. 
[02:54:30]  And she says, I don't know why he was so repetitive about it, but I felt provoked because I, for one,  don't find them funny and never have.  So I didn't appreciate Daniel Tosh, and then she writes, or anyone, telling me I should find them funny.  So I yelled out, actually, rape jokes are never funny.  See, here's what this fucking bitch does.  Yeah.  She sets it up so her rude interruption of an artist's performance is acceptable. 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  Here's what happened, dummy.  You went to a show, you didn't like what was said, so instead of quietly leaving,  I felt provoked.  Who gives a fuck?  Right.  Provoked.  You rudely, here's what she should have said.  I was watching a show, I didn't like what I heard, so I rudely interrupted.  Interrupted the guy doing a fucking show.  Right.  That is exactly.  Fucking up everyone's experience, by the way.  An artist was on stage.  Right.  Performing. 
[02:55:30]  I didn't like what he said, so instead of being a big girl and going home,  I had to seek attention for myself and make it about myself by yelling out.  So I yelled out, actually, rape jokes are never funny.  Which is, first of all, a lie.  Carlin did a brilliant joke on this years ago, a point about what jokes are, where he  put the emphasis.  So I hate this woman's guts immediately. 
[02:56:00]  And then she says, I did it because even though being, and then she puts in quotes,  disruptive, is against my nature, I felt that sitting there and saying nothing or leaving  quietly would have been against my values as a person and as a woman.  So basically, what you're saying is, allowing an artist to perform without interruption  is against your values as a person and as a woman. 
[02:56:30]  So what you're saying is, you have to agree with an artist to not interrupt what he's  doing.  To not interrupt them.  Right.  So if that guy was painting something that religiously she disagreed with, say he was  painting something she found objectionable as a woman.  If you're a woman and you back Islam, radical Islam, you're a fucking, a pretty interesting  woman to me.  So I guess if that guy was, say, painting something Islamic or praising Islam, I guess you should  go over and throw paint on it because an artist is giving something that you object to. 
[02:57:00]  She felt provoked.  Yeah, she felt provoked.  So she had to.  What if she was watching a Broadway show and the subject matter was something she didn't  agree with?  Would she stand up and interrupt the actors in the middle of a fucking live performance,  just like a comic is doing, a live performance?  Would she do that and feel that she was justified?  She might.  But if she did it in a movie, everybody in the movie would go, shut the fuck up, bitch.  Well, think of Book of Mormon.  Yeah, yeah.  That's some edgy shit.  Maybe she wouldn't like that. 
[02:57:30]  I don't see people standing up and going, whoa, I don't like what you're doing right  there.  Bitch.  So she says, I don't sit there while someone tells me how I should feel about something  as profound and damaging as rape.  He's not telling you, you dummy.  And by the way-  He's not talking to you personally, you dummy.  Yes, you do sit there because you've paid to go to a comedy club and hear what the artist  is saying.  You don't have to agree with it.  And if you don't like the show and you walk up to the manager and go, I'd like a refund,  okay, that to me is a fair course of action. 
[02:58:00]  I got a question, Jimmy.  Is it ever acceptable to heckle a comedian?  Never.  There you go.  For what?  There you go.  Your opinion as an audience member doesn't need to be heard by anybody else.  Yep.  It is very acceptable to walk out of a show.  Yeah.  It's very acceptable to ask for your money back.  Is it acceptable if you don't like what you heard from a comic to go home and blog about  it?  Yes.  There you go.  That's your opinion.  There you go.  You are allowed to voice your opinion.  Yeah, I don't begrudge this woman. 
[02:58:30]  I can't comprehend wanting to blog about it.  Right.  Again, it's just this little fucking, this, please do something.  But, um, sure, that's acceptable.  It was an experience you had that you didn't enjoy.  But she didn't just do that.  She fucking blurted out shit during a live performance.  Well, then she played the victim.  Yeah.  That's what people do.  They play the fucking victim.  Yeah.  And then she says, after I called out to him, Tosh paused for a moment and he goes,  hey, wouldn't it be funny if that girl got raped by like five guys right now?  Like right now.  Hilarious.  What if a bunch of guys just raped her?  And then she said, oh, I completely stunned and finding it hard to process what was happening, 
[02:59:00]  but knowing I needed to get out of there, immediately nudged my friend, who was completely stunned as well.  Oh, yeah.  And we hightailed it out of there.  It was humiliating, of course.  Hightailed easy to fuck.  Especially since the audience guffawed in response to Tosh, their eyes following us as we made our way out of there.  Uh, I didn't hear what the rest of what he said about me.  So here's what happened.  This fucking dummy rudely interrupts. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Tosh smashes her.  Because no reasonable person, baby, thinks that Tosh is saying she should be raped in a comedy club.  No rational person believes, in the context of a comedy stage, when the audience is laughing, that he is saying, I really want her to be raped.  No kidding aside.  Yeah, yeah.  If you think that, you're a fucking dummy, and if it wasn't the rape joke, it'd be something else.  Yeah.  Um, and in the lobby, she spoke with the girl, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:00:00]  And, uh, at the end, she writes, I should probably add that having to basically flee while Tosh was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if I was gang raped in that small, claustrophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying and threatening all the same.  Not really a small room in there.  Even if the actual scenario was unlikely to take place.  Right there.  Oh.  She admits, she admits she knows that that's not a real scenario.  Right.  But what she does, the same way how this fucking cunt set up her rude interruption to justify it, she now sets up why, even though I know this is ridiculous, here's why everything I'm doing and saying right now is acceptable. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And it's a fleeing.  This, you know, she has to justify, she knows that she's a fucking shit.  Yeah.  And she is just justifying what she wants to say.  Where'd that go?  Where are you?  At the end, she goes, uh, unlikely to take place.  The suggestion of it is violent enough and was meant to put me in my place.  No.  The suggestion, the response was responding to your heckle. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  You fucking dummy.  She would have a legit argument if Tosh was doing his act and then singled her out for no reason.  And just started railing her about rape.  And going, wouldn't it be funny if that girl in the white shirt got raped?  Like, because that's taking a private person and publicly saying something really harsh for no reason.  Like, and even then, as a comedy club, I would side with him.  Yeah.  But I would understand her being annoyed with that. 
[03:01:30]  But that would be rougher.  I would be a rougher one to explain.  Not that this is rough, by the way.  And at the end, she goes, please reblog and spread the word.  Oh, really?  Why do you need the word spread?  If it's so offensive.  Right.  Why do you want that spread out there?  Oh, that's right.  Now you're a part of the story.  Me.  And you're the victim.  And you want to be noticed.  Your blogs weren't doing it, so now you want this to do it.  And she wants him shut down.  Oh, God.  I hate this fucking chick.  And anyone that likes her is a dummy. 
[03:02:00]  Yes.  So I don't even watch Tosh's show.  I've heard it's great.  I mean, literally, Louie said good things about it.  Kyle said it's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  And I don't know Tosh.  I've met him once or twice.  He interviewed me once for a comedy center.  He's a very nice dude.  You don't need to know the person to defend what's right.  But you know what kind of a comic he is.  He's an edgier comic.  This drives me fucking crazy.  But I'm not shitting on him for apologizing because I really do get it.  Like, when you're making it, he has millions at stake, dude. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, Daniel Tosh is fucking making money.  It's just not worth it when his show is already edgy.  Comedy Central gives this guy a lot of leeway.  It's not worth it.  I bet she sits there going, I made him apology.  Look what I did.  I made him.  Ugh.  And I've really, I've thought about the apology in general that we hear almost on a daily  basis a lot lately.  And the reason why I don't have a problem with it anymore is because these guys are just  put out there by themselves without their company or anybody supporting and helping  them. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So now I understand it completely that these guys and we've been there, we've been there,  you know, XM at the time hired us to do an edgy show and then we went too edgy, I guess  one day, even though any day someone could take a, a, a, a sound clip and try to make  something of it.  Yeah.  And then you expect your bosses and your company to back you because they understand exactly  what you're about.  And they, they should understand that all we're trying to do is entertain or, or make  the audience laugh.  And there you realize, holy fuck, we're out there with a fucking, uh, we're on a raft with 
[03:03:30]  no fucking paddle in the middle of an ocean alone.  And you got to do what you got to do, unfortunately.  And that's why you see these apologies, these fake fucking apologies.  Cause no one backs you.  No one backs you.  No one's there for you when, when, when it, it, it matters and counts.  You know who they back?  No.  South Park.  Because South Park refuses to, like the way South Park handles shit.  Right.  Go fuck yourself.  And they go move on and do something harsher.  And you know, we don't have to bring up a million old examples. 
[03:04:00]  Let's go with the one that we discussed yesterday.  The trailer park ESPN guy.  His bosses should have just basically said, uh, we got this.  You don't have to apologize.  Relax.  We'll handle this.  We know you're trying to be funny.  We know that it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, a, a, a, a man's network.  We got this, but that's never the case.  It's never the case.  All of a sudden as an, as an employee or an entertainer, you feel completely vulnerable  with no one helping you out.  Yeah.  No one.  No one helps you. 
[03:04:30]  We should have been fired in the past, of course, but we also should have had, you know,  no backing for some of the shit we've done.  Yeah.  Complete backing.  But the, but the, in the end, uh, nah, they don't have your back.  So that's why you got to like, do what you got to do to save your own ass, which is the  fake apology.  Yeah.  And hence why Daniel Tosh is apologizing.  He doesn't believe in that.  I hope not.  And I probably not.  Of course not.  I hate this girl so much because I hate, I, she's such a manipulative little cunt and  I hate the way she's setting up her own fucking bullshit. 
[03:05:00]  You're, I, you don't think I see what you're doing.  You're building in your fucking explanation.  It's almost like she's setting up why, what she does.  You heckled.  Right.  That's it.  Mm-hmm.  Get up and get the fuck out if you don't like something.  Stop thinking for everybody else.  I, I, I don't.  Well, that's how radio shows get canceled.  It's so frustrating.  I could talk radio.  You could talk, uh, stand up obviously.  Radio shows have been canceled because of people that don't even listen to the fucking 
[03:05:30]  show.  It is fucking infuriating.  It's happened a million times.  So a whole audience that really enjoys a particular radio show has to, has to suffer because,  because of, uh, you know, uh, very small portion of, uh, the radio.  I don't get the difference.  Huh?  I don't get the difference.  It's the same shit.  Between, you know, somebody at a comedy club and somebody at a Broadway show.  Or an actor.  She would never, she would never stand up at a live performance of any other type but 
[03:06:00]  a comic.  Because for some reason, people feel like laughter is an admission of agreement.  People feel like when you laugh, like it's like, I, in movies, they don't feel that way.  Like everybody laughed when Cameron Diaz had come in her hair.  Right.  In, um, in, uh, something about Mary.  It's very funny.  Right.  But when you think of it, any woman who had come in her hair would be humiliated.  Right.  But for some reason, the ludicrousness of that was acceptable.  The over-the-top, retarded guy. 
[03:06:30]  Because they're acting.  They're acting.  I laughed when Migs threw it at her.  I fucking, I acknowledged it.  I reenacted it.  Why don't people understand that radio personalities, this is an exaggerated version of my personality  every fucking thing on this show.  Yes.  And I don't even like admitting that because I don't, I don't want to give that shit away.  I do calm my racism down on the show.  Yeah, there you go.  But, uh.  And, but it goes back to Jimmy.  So, uh, is it, uh, is it an exaggerated, um, uh, you on stage? 
[03:07:00]  Sure.  Everything is, you're sarcastic.  Yes.  But why don't people understand that when they're sitting there?  Um, because they're.  I knew the answer, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I just wanted you to say it.  So, you're an exaggerated version of yourself when you're doing stand-up.  Yeah, like when you think of, think of, like, I'm saying about Mary, it's a hundred million  dollar comedy.  So, you think of Ben Stiller.  He had a dog bite his dick in the movie.  It's hilarious.  Right.  It's a very funny scene.  Of course.  But what you're really seeing is, you're seeing a dog biting the dick of an individual. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  That's a really painful, awful thing, and yet it's funny.  So, it's like, and I know the difference between rape and a slapstick moment, but this  differentiating between what's acceptable and what isn't is what drives me fucking, I  don't begrudge anybody their personal line of acceptability, but don't, don't want other  people to have that line with you.  Just be a big boy or girl and say, that's not for me and ignore it.  That wasn't his personal view on rape.  No.  Daniel Tosh.  Why, why can't you figure that out? 
[03:08:00]  It's not Charlie Rose he's doing.  He's fucking on stage at the Laugh Factory, you dumb hole.  And if you don't, you don't like it, you walk out.  And guess what?  If enough people walk out because they don't like Daniel Tosh's rape humor, then he might  have to adjust his comedy or he might go away.  I don't know.  But it's not up to you.  It's not up to you.  It's ridiculous.  That rant got me tired.  We should go home.  Yeah, I didn't mean to yap so long.  Oh my God, it's great.  I got to pee anyway. 
[03:08:30]  Four minute Carlin bit, someone just said in my ear.  Who is that someone?  It's about rape, probably, to great.  Yeah?  He goes, bullshit, I think it's hysterical.  And he did a joke about rape.  Daniel Tosh is ripped off George Carlin, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  We have the Scott and Todd.  We could do that tomorrow, certainly.  Oh, yeah.  And they're also promoting the Cookie Monster singing Call Me Maybe.  They think that's hilarious.  Oh, boy.  Twitter thought that was hilarious yesterday, too.  They thought it was hysterical. 
[03:09:00]  Have you heard of that?  No.  I haven't either.  Maybe it is hilarious.  Maybe it is.  Who knows?  I just assumed.  There's no way Cookie Monster doing Call Me Maybe is hilarious.  Oh, wait a sec.  Maybe I should have more of an open mind.  What are the odds it's hilarious?  Do you have it, E-Rock?  No, I don't.  Is it online somewhere?  I'm sure it is, if you have it.  Well, Sam gave up on the show an hour ago, so.  Oh, shit.  Have that happen.  We can't go to that computer and do anything.  He's resting for his show. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  Do you want to leave with the George Carlin bit, then?  Yeah, we should.  That sounds good.  All right, guys.  All right, everyone.  All right, then.  You have good'en.  You have a good one.  And Jimmy's going to be going out to Comical Con.  Oh, this is it for Jimmy for this week?  Yeah.  Me and Sam are gone.  Thank God Sam's gone.  Sam.  And Ant's on Fox tonight, right?  On Red Eye, yes.  Catch me on the Red Eye, the Seedman.  And I'll be taking sunset pictures.  Ooh.  Right, E-Rock? 
[03:10:00]  E-Rock loves them.  I took a monster picture yesterday.  I mixed it up a little bit.  Comment?  From homeless or crazy people, yeah.  Serves me well.  No, you don't get the last word.  Sure I do.  Goodbye.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Some people don't like you to talk like that.  Oh, some people don't like to shut you up for saying those things.  You know that.  Lots of people, lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk.  Tell you what you can't talk about. 
[03:10:30]  Well, sometimes they'll say, well, you can talk about something, but you can't joke about it.  Say you can't joke about something because it's not funny.  Comedians run into that shit all the time.  Like rape.  They'll say, you can't joke about rape.  Rape's not funny.  I say, fuck you.  I think it's hilarious.  How do you like that?  I can prove to you that rape is funny.  Picture Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd.  See?  Hey, why do you think they call him Porky, huh?  I know what you're going to say.  Elmer was asking for it.  Elmer was coming on to Porky. 
[03:11:00]  Porky couldn't help himself.  He got a heart on.  He got horny.  He lost control.  He went out of his mind.  A lot of men talk like that.  A lot of men think that way.  They think it's the woman's fault.  They like to blame the rape on the woman.  Say, hey, she had it coming.  She was wearing a short skirt.  These guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers.  Don't seem fair to me.  Don't seem right.  But you can joke about it.  I believe you can joke about anything.  It all depends on how you construct the joke.  What the exaggeration is.  What the exaggeration is. 
[03:11:30]  Because every joke needs one exaggeration.  Every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion.  Give you an example.  You ever see a news story like this in the paper?  Every now and then you run into a story.  It says, some guy broke into a house, stole a lot of things,  and while he was in there, he raped an 81-year-old woman.  And I'm thinking to myself, why?  What the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have? 
[03:12:00]  I want to say, why did you do that?  Well, she was coming on to me.  We were dancing and I got horny.  Hey, she was asking for it.  She had on a tight bathrobe.  I say, Jesus Christ, be a little fucking selective next time, will you?  Now, speaking of rape, you know what I wonder?  I wonder, is there more rape at the equator or the North Pole?  These are the kind of things I think about when I'm sitting home alone and the power goes out. 
[03:12:30]  I wonder, is there more rape at the equator or the North Pole?  I mean, per capita.  I know the populations are different.  Most people think it's the equator.  I think it's the North Pole.  People think it's the equator because it's hot down there.  They don't wear a lot of clothing.  Guys can see women's tits.  They get horny and there's a lot of fucking going on.  That's exactly why there's less rape at the equator.  Because there's a lot of fucking going on.  You can tell there's a lot of fucking at the equator.  Take a look at the population figures.  Billions of people live near the equator.  How many Eskimos we got? 
[03:13:00]  30?  35?  No one's getting laid at the North Pole.  It's too fucking cold.  Guys say to their wives, hey, tonight, honey, huh?  Tonight, huh?  Are you crazy?  The windchill factor is 300 below.  These guys are deprived.  They're horny.  They're pent up.  Every now and then, they bust out.  They got to rape somebody.  Now, the biggest problem an Eskimo rapist has,  trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman who's kicking. 
[03:13:30]  Did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone  who doesn't want to take them off?  You would lose your heart on in the process.  Up at the North Pole, your dick would shrivel up  like a stack of dimes.  That's another thing I wonder.  I wonder, does a rapist have a heart on  when he leaves the house in the morning?  Or does he develop it during the day  while he's walking around looking for somebody?  These are the kind of thoughts 
[03:14:00]  that kept me out of the really good schools.  Serious XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a show, what a show!  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  My name is Sam Roberts,  and it's time to play What Did You Learn?  Call us up right now, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969. 
[03:14:30]  And tell me,  listening to the entire show,  what was it that you took from it?  How has your life improved?  What new information do you have?  What I want to know  is what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Today, I learned that,  lie as he may,  Scott Shannon is at least 70 years old.  Is that right, Iraq? 
[03:15:00]  Clever, yes.  He's got to be, hasn't he?  What did you learn today?  I don't know.  It's all a blur right now.  It was a rough one for you.  I also learned...  Well, yeah, it wasn't...  At the beginning, it was rough.  You were a little angry at first.  Yeah, fair.  Fair to say, yeah.  Were you able to blow it off as we went?  Well, apparently, you know,  he let it go,  so everything's all good.  That's why I was saying...  I wrote it down.  I was bummed.  I was so glad he brought this up, 
[03:15:30]  Opie we're talking about,  because he always does it.  And I was bummed  that I didn't get to bring it up  on Monday's after show,  but I was able to bring it up today.  I wrote this down.  And that's what else I learned,  that when Opie gets into an argument,  as long as he's good,  everything's good.  Opie and Anthony tortured  a DJ named Carol Miller  when they were on WNEW  to the point where  they made Carol Miller  wait in the mail room  until they were completely  out of the hallway  before she could enter the studio 
[03:16:00]  to start her show.  You know what I mean?  She would have to wait  in the mail room,  and Opie and Anthony  had to not only be out of the studio,  but in their offices  before she could enter her studio  to do her show,  which was the same studio.  And they just destroyed her on the air.  We've played the tapes before.  I think, I'm sure they're on YouTube  if you look up Carol Miller tapes,  Opie and Anthony.  But they completely,  they destroyed her,  they made a mockery  of her entire profession,  her entire career.  Then, she's coming out  with this book in August. 
[03:16:30]  Anthony finds out  that she talks about  her altercation,  her history  with Opie and Anthony  in the book.  And Opie,  without irony,  in this instance,  without irony,  he goes,  she writes about it?  I let that go years ago!  And you go,  Opie,  it's not up to you  to let it go.  You are the offender  in this scenario.  And he did it again today  with you, E-Rock,  where he calls you in  and he starts,  he brings up something  from five or six years ago. 
[03:17:00]  I was out of the room.  How did that come up  to begin with?  Because I walk back  in the room  and he's just talking  about you having his picture  five years ago,  six years ago.  You know what?  I was screening  the Scott and Todd bit in here  and I didn't know  they were talking about me.  As soon as I flipped  my headphones over,  I hear they're going,  E-Rock!  And I said,  what?  And then it just,  it just started.  It came up,  so I don't know  exactly what started it.  Oh my God.  Well, yeah,  he did it again though  and he goes,  well, E-Rock,  I'm good.  After he bashed you  for an hour, 
[03:17:30]  I'm good.  It took six years,  but yeah,  I guess he's good.  Mark in Illinois.  Mark,  you are on  After Open Anthony Live.  What did you learn  on today's show?  I learned you're  automatically a cunt  if you object  to rape jokes.  Well,  I don't think  that's what they were saying.  Do you disagree  with Jim's assessment  of this woman?  No,  it's fucking right  on the money, man.  Yeah,  I think she's...  If you don't fucking like it,  get up and leave.  Yeah,  I think she's allowed  not to like it.  It's more of a cunty thing  to interrupt the show, 
[03:18:00]  to, you know,  to stop.  Because the thing  that people don't  kind of remember  is that  artistic expression  is artistic expression  and there's nothing  that says you have  to agree with it  and there's nothing  that says you have  to like it.  But part of  allowing people  to have their own  personal freedoms  is that they're allowed  to say whatever they want.  Like,  you shouldn't be  interrupting shows  and stopping people  from saying it  because people  paid money  to see Daniel Tosh. 
[03:18:30]  Tosh.  Tosh.  People paid money  to see Daniel Tosh  and it's like  if you don't like  what he's saying  then you're allowed  not to  but it doesn't mean  you stop the show  for everybody else  who is paying  and who likes,  you know,  what they're seeing.  Luke in Massachusetts,  what did you learn?  Well,  at the beginning  of the show  they were talking  about stalkers  and how they  deal with them  and, you know,  a few weeks ago  I learned something  about E-Rock.  I called up  and I learned  that he was a dummy  but today  I learned that 
[03:19:00]  alas,  he is the biggest  ONA stalker ever.  Do you consider yourself,  what do you say  to that, E-Rock?  No,  I'm not a stalker.  You don't think  you're a stalker?  You're a super fan  though, right?  And now you're there  and now you're  stealing all these stuff.  Troy Kwan's stuff,  I mean,  I don't know, man.  Good one.  No,  I'm not a stalker.  I'm not stealing  their shit.  When,  is there a part of you  that's still  that super fan?  If,  you know what,  I think that super fan  stuff was beat out 
[03:19:30]  of me a long time ago.  Yeah.  Well, hey,  he doesn't actually  listen to the show  anymore.  Jesus.  Luke,  you are really  not an E-Rock fan.  Well,  you know,  he blocked me  on Twitter,  so whatever,  you know.  Well,  I'm sure it was  warranted,  right?  That's probably,  yeah.  I wonder why.  If he can't see me  bash him on Twitter,  then he'll just  listen to it here.  I'll just keep  calling up.  Oh,  really?  774?  Okay.  Thank you,  Luke.  You can't give out  somebody's phone number.  I didn't give out  his phone number.  So,  you're not a super fan  fan anymore. 
[03:20:00]  I think that was long  gone.  I think after the,  after about the first  year,  that kind of,  when you,  for,  I remember,  because you can't  be that way here.  Can you find  your first  on air thing?  Like,  can you go into  the first show?  Because I remember  listening to it.  Do you have the first  show there in Dillette?  Can you quickly find,  like,  when you were...  I think it's in the  back,  but let me see.  Yeah.  See if you can find  real quick,  just the first quick  mention of Erock on the  air.  Because it is a big  difference.  We were talking  about it today  from you sort of 
[03:20:30]  being this guy  who would take  a lot of shit,  who was super happy  to be there.  You were the biggest  super O&A fan  in the world.  To now,  you have been  complete...  You've been beaten  to a pulp.  You're a battered wife.  And you just kind of  realize that this is  life.  This is what you're  married into.  Marriage to you  is a commitment,  so you're not  going to leave.  But,  you're not going  to like it either.  I think the 
[03:21:00]  battered wife  assessment is a bit  much.  You don't think  you're a battered  wife?  No.  A little bit.  No, I just think  I do what I have  to for the sake  of the show.  That's what I'm  saying.  For the sake  of the marriage,  you stay in there.  For the kids,  Eric,  you are a battered  wife with children.  And this show  is your children.  For the kids?  You stay together  for the kids.  You don't want the  kids to know  there's anything wrong.  But what you don't  realize is,  you're doing more  damage to those  kids by staying  here.  Really? 
[03:21:30]  That's not the  feedback I've been  getting.  What's the feedback  you've been getting?  A lot of people  liked what they  heard today.  They're not so  happy with you,  but they liked  what I did.  What did you do?  Me on the air  today.  They liked the  segment?  They liked the  segment.  Anybody who  wasn't happy with  what I did on the  air today?  There's a lot.  Fucking idiot.  I'd read your  Twitter.  I got like three  comments on Twitter  about it.  There's not a lot  at all.  Anybody who  doesn't understand  what's going on,  who doesn't like  what happened, 
[03:22:00]  why don't you  realize this?  There's no  Superman without  Lex Luthor,  you nitwit.  I didn't know you  were a nemesis.  That's right.  I am a  supervillain.  Don't you  understand what  I'm doing?  I am a supervillain  looking for the  kryptonite to  take down  super sex man.  That's what I'm  doing.  And you keep  losing?  E-Rock is  Superman.  I can't beat  him, but you're  God damn it.  Do I have to  break it down for  the people every  time, Eric?  Look at you  getting geeky. 
[03:22:30]  Well, I know a  little bit about  Superman.  For God's sake,  but you can't  be a hero without  a force to fight  against, right?  Now, Opie, I  think, I don't  think he is a  supervillain.  I think he is,  you were right in  your assessment, a  bit of a curmudgeon  at times.  Let me see, what  else is going on?  Billy Ann in New  Jersey, what did  you learn?  I learned today  that rape is in  fact funny.  See, Billy Ann? 
[03:23:00]  At times.  Some people don't  know what a  fucking joke is,  and it's just  ridiculous.  What people need  to realize is you  cannot make a  blanket statement  about anything.  There is nothing  that is never funny.  Everything is funny  at least sometimes.  There is nothing  that hasn't been  funny at least once.  Apparently, that  lady has no idea.  She must have a  tampon caught sideways  because she doesn't  know how to take a  joke.  Exactly.  And she doesn't  know how to put  in a tampon.  No. 
[03:23:30]  No, I don't  tell.  Thank you,  Billy Ann.  Thank you.  Rape is not funny  in every circumstance.  Believe you me,  there are many  circumstances where  rape is not funny  at all.  Almost every  circumstance it's  not.  Exactly.  But, what happens  if a clown  rapes?  I don't know.  There's always  something to  everything.  You know what I  mean?  9-11 is funny  in some instances.  Very, very few,  but some, yes.  Like Hulk Hogan?  Exactly, Eric.  Like Hulk Hogan. 
[03:24:00]  Hulk Hogan taking  down the World  Trade Centers is  funny as shit.  And this is what  this is, and this  is probably the  same people who  were like, oh  E-Rock, you  should punch Sam.  These are the  same people.  I actually got  Twitter comments.  This is why no  individual on  Twitter, you can't  take any one  individual on  Twitter seriously.  There were actually  Twitter comments.  After we did that  Jocktober bit, I  can't believe it was  that long ago.  That was October.  After we did the  bit where we were 
[03:24:30]  looking at Hulk Hogan  and pictures of  him tearing down  the World Trade  Centers, and I  was laughing my  ass off, and we  all laughed our  asses off, and it  was hilarious, there  were actually people  commenting in, oh  really, laughing about  9-11?  Real cool, guys.  Yeah, yeah, real  funny.  It's Hulk Hogan  doing it.  The absurdity of it  is what's funny.  Loosen up.  That's what Carlin  said.  It's how you  exaggerate the joke.  Right.  What you're laughing 
[03:25:00]  at is not the action,  it's just the pure,  absurdity of what's  in front of you.  You know?  Rod in North Dakota.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, E-Rock.  I learned today that  Anthony hates fake  Australian accents.  He does.  He says they're the  worst.  He wanted to tell  that to Ron and  Fez, but what he  didn't realize, Anthony  called up here, I  swear, I came in here  and I was doing some  interview that I was  pre-taping, and I was  doing it in this  studio, and the hotline  is ringing when we  get in here, and I  don't know what it is, 
[03:25:30]  and then it stops  ringing, and then it  starts ringing again.  And the way we know  when a phone's ringing  is a little light pops  up on the screen.  So I picked up the  phone, I go, hello?  And the hotline is, we  have three lines.  We have 866-WOW-1-WOW  is, we have a ton of  lines that light up when  that number is called.  There's three lines that  are lit up when another  number is called, and  that number is given to  Anthony or whoever.  And guests.  And guests, yeah.  So that way, and it's  just so they don't hit a  busy signal when they  call up.  So we did it, I was in 
[03:26:00]  the studio, and the  hotline's ringing, I  pick it up, and Anthony's  on the other line, and he  wanted to get through to  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez were in  best of.  It's the exact thing that  we've made fun of callers  day in and day out for  doing.  He called up, but he  called up Ron and Fez to  talk about, you know, how  awful fake Australian  accents were.  I guess that's his pet  peeve.  A lot of people learned  about this today.  Don in Texas.  Hey, Sam, how's it  going, man? 
[03:26:30]  Hey, I learned today on  the show that basically  if you're from Texas with  an Australian accent and  you say fiction, you  sound like a fucking  retard.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  What about you, Steve, in  London?  Steve in London?  Hi, I learned that  Anthony can do a  perfect Australian accent.  It's flawless.  Are you calling from  London right now, for  real?  Yeah, I am.  It's costing me lots of  money.  What are you listening to  online?  Yeah. 
[03:27:00]  And Pal Talk, actually,  except then I called up.  Oh, wow.  How many, uh, is there a  big Opie and Anthony  following in London?  Um, a little bit.  Yeah?  Do you have a, you talk,  are there people who you  actually talk to the show  about there?  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  A few people.  It's the Louie episode  that got us hooked on to  this show.  Which Louie episode?  The Louie C.K.  shows that got us.  Oh, like you found it on  YouTube?  Yeah.  Wow, that's amazing.  And so, and then, does  everybody listen on Pal Talk  or do you listen on 
[03:27:30]  SiriusXM.com?  I did, and then I didn't  because it didn't work  anymore.  Hmm, that's weird.  Um, well listen, very  cool.  Do you, what does  England think of Sam  Roberts?  He think, um, we think  he is, he's just brilliant.  He's amazing.  Fantastic.  You know, I used to live  in England, Stephen.  I did, no.  I love how much England,  you see that, Eric?  Twitter can go eat a dick  because London loves  Sam Roberts.  They're calling you  stupid git.  Stupid, nobody's calling  me a stupid, Stephen,  are they calling me a 
[03:28:00]  stupid git in London?  Uh, no.  Thank God.  Thank you for you, Stephen.  Thank you, Sam Roberts,  for your brilliant show.  I'll talk to you later.  See ya.  Later.  Yeah, um, so, the  Australia thing got me,  it's amazing the  international following  that this show has  somehow acquired because  apparently we have fans  in London.  We just talked to  Stephen.  We have all these fans  in London.  Keith Robinson, Jim  said, who's another  comedian, was telling us 
[03:28:30]  that we have a big fan  base in Australia.  Somebody's saying we're  huge in Dublin, Ireland  on feedback right now.  It's a, it's, it's a  very cool thing, but  we were trying to  figure out why  Australia is, uh, a  big, has such a big  Opie Anthony following.  We should do our next  live show from there.  From Australia?  Yeah.  Have you ever been?  No, but I wanted to.  It's unbelievable.  I was there in sixth  grade.  But that's, what are you  laughing at?  I don't know, it's so  long ago. 
[03:29:00]  Who was on the phone,  Sarah?  That's Rob.  Handsome Rob, he knows  a good joke when he  hears one.  Yeah, no, I was there  when I was in sixth  grade, and it was  incredible.  I would love to go  back, but like Rob  said, it was quite a  bit of time ago.  That only speaks to  how great a time I  had, though.  I was in Sydney and  Melbourne and all  these, all this  Adelaide.  I was all over the  place there.  It was great.  I was there for like  three weeks.  I want to go back.  You're right.  Is there any bars in  Australia that we could  do a little live gig out  of?  I'm sure there's plenty  of bars that we could  find something.  Why don't we just  move the show to 
[03:29:30]  Australia permanently?  We should just do a  week in Australia.  Why don't we just do  all of it in Australia?  Why don't we just  start broadcasting from  Australia?  There's no...  I don't think we  could live there.  Why?  You want to live in  Australia?  Yeah, let's do it,  dude.  What's wrong with that?  I kind of like it up  here.  I just bought a house.  Oh, that's true.  I don't want to sell  it and move down there.  Maybe we could ISDN  Iraq from America.  Iraq's stuck in America  and the rest of us are  in Australia.  I'm telling you,  Australia's the bomb.  We should definitely  go and do a week there. 
[03:30:00]  You remember, though,  well, we got to do  more than a week.  That flight's like  20 hours.  We could do  nighttime shows  and they'll be on  here in the morning.  That's right.  And we can do  wintertime shows  and they'll be on  here in the summer.  Okay.  Their seasons are  reversed in Australia.  So is the toilet water.  Where'd you learn  that from?  No, that's not.  It's the Simpsons.  Yes, you learned it  from the Simpsons.  Exactly.  Let me see.  John in Ohio? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  What did you learn  on the show?  Oh.  Yeah.  Hey, you're on the show.  Yeah, Sam?  Yeah.  John.  Yeah, hey.  Hey.  Hey, uh,  I love listening to you guys.  I learned today  that Sam Roberts  finds it amazing  that you can find  videos on YouTube  from another country.  First of all,  don't call me stupid  when you couldn't even  respond to me  when I said hello to you.  You can't work a phone.  And second of all,  I didn't say it was amazing 
[03:31:00]  that people listen  on YouTube.  I said it was amazing  that people listen regularly  and call the show  and whatnot.  John.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you said it.  And let me tell you  something else, John.  I've been to Ohio before.  It's not nearly  as cool as Australia.  No, it's not.  Hey, congratulations  on your wedding.  I have a question  about that.  Go ahead.  How much time  and thought  was put into  setting the date 
[03:31:30]  of your wedding  so it coincides  with Opie and Anthony's  contract not expiring  so you'd still get  their goody-goody gift  while they were employed?  Well, I mean,  no.  I waited a year  and a half.  I was engaged  for a year and a half.  I wasn't going to wait  until October  to get married.  There was no thought  of whether or not  they'd be under contract  because let me tell you  something.  Opie and Anthony  have a little something  called fuck you money  which means I would be 
[03:32:00]  expecting that fat check  whether they were  signed to a contract  or not.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So there you have it,  John.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Pirate Trucker?  Sam, I learned today  because I overslept  that you are completely  uninformed about Australia.  What are you talking about?  I didn't even say  anything about Australia.  All the women are ugly.  What do you know  they're not?  It's hot,  it's dirty,  and limeys are unfunny. 
[03:32:30]  Number one,  limeys are from England.  You idiot.  Number two,  women in Australia  are beautiful.  Number three,  Jim Jeffries,  one of the funniest guys  on this show,  is,  is he British  to Australia  or Australian?  He's Australia to England.  Okay,  he's Australian.  Number four,  sometimes it's hot  but it's beautiful  out there.  So you pirate trucker,  keep on being  a pirate trucker 
[03:33:00]  asshole  and I'll keep doing this  and being the man  who's informing  the people  of everything  they need to know  about the country  that is Australia.  Your Australia  super headquarters  is after  Opie and Anthony Live  from here on out  regardless of  what that guy says.  Hey Sam.  Yes Eric.  Do you know in Australia  they call bullfrogs  Chazwazers.  Chazwazers?  Yes.  Well,  Walt Sing Matilda.  I got that from  The Simpsons.  God damn it.  It's probably not even true. 
[03:33:30]  No,  that's just what  they think  they should be called.  They also,  I've heard that  in Australia  they also punish people  through their court system  with just a little  kick in the bum.  Yes,  with a giant boot.  Listen,  this isn't  The Simpsons reference show.  This is the Australia  after Opie and Anthony  Live special.  Sorry,  work some wrestling  references in there.  You should.  How about Outback Jack?  How about that?  I was trying  to figure out  the Australia connection.  What attracts 
[03:34:00]  the Australian people  to the Opie and Anthony show.  Racism?  They are racist  in Australia,  aren't they?  Towards their aborigines.  Yeah,  and aborigines are dark  so that's like black  and Anthony doesn't like  black people  so that works out.  Do you listen to  Jim Jeffries' podcast  by any chance?  No.  I would.  I mean,  I've heard good things.  He does a good podcast  with Eddie If.  And when Jim  Do we run it yet?  No.  Okay.  I'm sure soon.  Yeah,  he hasn't been around.  But I didn't know 
[03:34:30]  that there's a term  that he,  I think he named his dog  that it turns out  it's the equivalent  of the N-word  in the United States.  What is it?  But you can't,  you can't call aborigines,  I believe it's abos.  Abos?  Yeah.  Abbo is like the N-word?  Yeah.  You stupid abbo?  Yeah.  You're abbo rich?  See,  now I'm gonna have to dump  in Australia.  Here's fine,  but Australia's gonna have to dump.  Oh yeah,  hit the Australia dump button.  But I think,  my first recollection  of a big Australian influence 
[03:35:00]  on the show,  because we did,  we did that bit where,  you know,  the Australian radio show,  what was that?  Was that a rape thing?  Remember the Australian radio show  where she goes,  Mom,  I was raped or something?  The kid?  Yeah,  you're right.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  let me see if I have that.  So there was that,  but I think before that,  um,  was,  my favorite Australia bit,  and that was because  Steve C. 
[03:35:30]  went directly  under the bus for this.  Uh,  there was a video,  and it went completely viral.  It was,  um,  I think it was  The Current Affair.  Yeah.  It was the video clip,  and the kid's name  was Corey Delaney.  Okay,  so Corey Delaney,  he's,  uh,  he's just this total surfer dude.  He's pretty much Jeff Spicoli,  but he's Australian,  and he's being himself,  and he just makes a complete joke.  Yeah,  let's play,  uh,  let's,  let's play,  I have in here the YouTube clip  of the Corey Delaney video. 
[03:36:00]  Just push play,  and then I'll pot it up  as soon as he comes on.  Um,  so Corey Delaney,  he's like,  he's got his sunglasses on  and his neon hat on,  and this video was all over.  Where's the place?  Where is this kid?  Uh,  fast forward.  I have the audio clips,  but if you got the video.  Yeah,  okay,  so here he is.  So,  yeah.  What you ask is,  what were you thinking?  Um,  I wasn't really.  Did your parents say  you could have a party? 
[03:36:30]  Um,  no.  So,  why did you?  Um,  I don't know,  it was just a get-together  with a couple mates at first,  and then we thought  we might as well  just have a bit of a party,  and then it sort of  just got out of hand,  and,  yeah.  Well,  500 people turned up,  the air wing of the police force,  the dog squad,  your neighbour's cars  were being destroyed.  What have your parents  had to say,  Corey?  Um,  I haven't really talked to them  because every time they call,  I don't answer.  Because,  yeah, 
[03:37:00]  they probably try to kill me.  So,  that's a short-term strategy.  You're going to have to talk to them eventually.  What are you going to say?  Um,  sorry.  Are you sorry?  Uh,  yeah,  yeah,  I am.  You don't sound very sorry.  Well,  I can't be exactly blamed  for everything that happened  because it wasn't in the house,  it was out in the street,  and I didn't do it.  Like,  the police said,  you stay inside  so you don't get in trouble,  so I did what he said,  so.  Why don't you take this opportunity now 
[03:37:30]  to apologise  to your parents  and to your neighbours  who have said today  that they were frightened?  Well,  I've already,  I've already offered,  like,  to say sorry to them and stuff  when I see them,  so,  I will say sorry now  for everything that happened.  Why don't you take your glasses off  so we can see you  and then apologise  to your neighbours  for frightening them?  Nah,  nah,  I'll leave these on.  Nah,  I like them.  They,  they might be fined  $20,000.  He just goes on  and on  just not giving a fuck 
[03:38:00]  and we were obsessed  with this kid  for a little while  so Steve C,  our executive producer  at the time,  he comes in  and he goes,  Opie,  Anthony,  I did it.  I got  Corey Delaney  on the phone  and they go,  no way.  The Australian kid?  He goes,  yep,  you bet I did  and he gets this kid  on the phone  and Opie and Anthony  have what they believe  is a conversation  with Corey Delaney, 
[03:38:30]  the Australian kid  from this video  and then he walks back  into the office.  Steve C,  our executive producer  at the time,  he walks into the office  and he said  the most regrettable sentence  he will ever  in his life say  in front of me.  He said these words  which haunted him  for the rest  of his tenure  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Do you have those words  by themselves, Eric?  Is that what you're  queuing up?  No, I'm looking for the  Corey call.  Okay, no problem.  Don't worry about it.  He said to me 
[03:39:00]  after they hung up  with this quote unquote  Corey,  he goes,  and that's how you  executive produce.  Steve C then quickly  found out  that the kid  that we had  on the phone  was just some  random kid  from Australia.  It wasn't Corey at all.  He got just some guy  with an Australian accent.  He did no follow-up work 
[03:39:30]  and he thought  it was Corey.  What ensued,  do you have the  production piece?  I do.  All right,  let's just play  the production piece.  This is what came out  of the Australian  Corey situation.  Hello,  is this Australian?  Is Corey there?  I'm trying to call  a continent.  Who would you like me?  His name is Corey.  Do you have a last name?  No, but he's the guy  from the news clip.  Huh?  Corey,  the man on the computer.  He has delicious,  delicious nipple rings  and a smooth chest. 
[03:40:00]  Like me.  Could you please  connect me with him?  Oh, hello.  This is Corey.  It's him.  It sounds,  he's got an accent.  Hi,  do you have an X, Sam?  Huh?  Okay,  could you talk  to Opie and Anthony?  And that's how  you executive produce.  There it is.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It was just the most  dunder-headed move  you could possibly make  and I couldn't have been happier  with the way it turned out  for him.  Just so great.  Was that not,  Sal,  you,  I guess,  you were just listening 
[03:40:30]  to the show at the time.  You remember that?  No,  I don't remember it  to be quite honest.  What a great,  do you wish  that you were here  for those days?  That's such a douchey  line to say.  Oh,  especially when he's just,  everybody was so,  when he's tense  but not in a bad way,  they were just like,  what,  when he said it  or when,  when he said it  and we,  well actually,  when we found out  the call wasn't real  and then when he had said that,  everyone was just kind of like,  I can't believe this.  Yeah,  it was just so uncomfortable. 
[03:41:00]  Speaking of uncomfortable,  we also,  so Handsome Rob is on the phones today,  our intern?  Yeah.  How's young Connor doing?  Connor's just sitting here  observing the show.  He's been banned from the phones?  Well,  I don't know if he's banned  from the phones  for your show,  but I just took the liberty  of just keeping Rob on  since he did the O&A show phones.  Connor had a rough day  again yesterday.  We'll talk to Connor real quick.  Let's bring him in here  for a second.  Connor's our intern. 
[03:41:30]  We'll bring Connor in  just for a quick sec.  I miss Kevin.  You miss Kevin?  Whenever he's not here,  I miss him.  Yeah.  Uncle Kevvy's not in today.  Uncle Kevvy.  He'll be in tomorrow.  Connor,  we didn't get to it yesterday,  but you had a rough show yesterday.  Why does he go for it?  Yeah,  why does he always go to Ant's seat?  Take the guest seat over there.  Oh,  geez.  Oh,  he's got his hands up.  Like,  what the fuck,  Eric?  What difference does it make  what mic I hit?  Ant doesn't like people  on his microphone.  When you stop busting my balls 
[03:42:00]  is what he's saying.  So,  Connor,  you had a rough show yesterday?  Yeah,  it happens,  yeah.  Yeah,  well,  I know it happens to you.  It's happened to you quite a bit.  Connor,  if you remember,  is the same intern  who was found guilty  in the Velveeta-Valvinus  debacle,  and now he made,  is that your second mistake  screening calls  on the Opie and Anthony show  that was brought to the air?  I think,  I think that was my second mistake,  but I still call bullshit on it.  You call bullshit on that,  on yesterday's mistake? 
[03:42:30]  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  the Velveeta-Valvinus one.  You do?  Yeah.  That wasn't me.  That wasn't you.  You were found guilty  by a jury of your peers.  Yeah,  but people are found guilty  and aren't actually guilty.  There was no DNA test.  And there's no appeal.  Eric,  what do you say  to an intern like Connor  when he screws up again  on the phone?  First of all,  you know that makes you look bad,  so when Opie starts yelling  about who's on the phones,  do you get like,  oh,  fuck.  Yeah,  pretty much.  Because,  like,  you know,  Opie's question,  and it's,  and in this case, 
[03:43:00]  Opie questioning you  about the Oprah picture,  the legitimacy of that  could be argued.  Opie questioning you  about why is,  uh,  Connor on the phones again  is,  is more legitimate,  and I think that's  a real question.  Do you realize that  when he asks it?  That,  that this is a legitimate complaint?  Oh,  yeah,  it's definitely  a legitimate complaint.  I mean,  the first one,  when he's changing the text  as Opie's answering the line  and trying to read it,  and everything Opie just said 
[03:43:30]  disappeared.  Yeah.  Obviously,  there's no way  anyone could defend  Connor on that,  because he's doing it  as Opie's taking the call.  Then the Velveeta situation.  Well,  that was brought up  as a lesser point,  but valid.  You know,  like,  it wasn't interrupting  the show.  But then,  there,  yeah,  I know,  yeah,  yeah,  I agree.  And then,  and then there was  this yesterday.  What do you say  to him,  though?  Like,  how do you deal  with that  as the intern boss?  Well,  it's like,  what can you do?  I mean,  once they,  they know how the system works, 
[03:44:00]  they know what they're  supposed to ask,  and how to,  um,  format it on the screen there  so,  you know,  so the host can read it,  and when he doesn't do that,  like,  what are you supposed to do?  What do you think?  It's just basic stuff.  Where do you think  the,  uh,  disconnection is,  Connor?  Well,  no,  Eric taught me how to do it.  I just fucked up.  Yeah,  but,  you know,  where do,  what do we do to stop you  from fucking up?  Uh,  I really don't think  there is anything.  I think,  you know,  it's just a mistake.  He will fuck up again  is what he's telling you.  Oh,  no,  I probably will.  No,  that's not what I want to hear,  Connor. 
[03:44:30]  You know when the next time  I'm going to fuck up is?  Never.  Quarter to never.  Never.  Maybe I will,  but that's the attitude.  You never fuck up.  Don't say I probably will fuck up.  Never.  I mean,  if you have to,  you have to,  and you have to reassess.  You have to say,  what did I do wrong?  I can't do that again.  You got to reassess.  You got to start thinking.  You,  however,  think you were wrongly convicted.  Oh,  yeah.  Rob,  do you still stand by  you did not write  Val Vita instead of Val Venus?  Truth?  Oh,  yeah,  I wrote it.  What?  Yeah, 
[03:45:00]  Rob told me yesterday.  What?  Yeah,  I totally wrote it.  Whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  Eric.  I had no idea.  You have to deal with your  shitty little intern.  Well,  here was the thing,  because I thought Connor  had did it at first,  but when we had the discussion,  the court case,  if you will,  I changed my answer.  I said,  it's Rob.  You did.  You said it was Rob.  I said it was Rob,  and then everyone voted  and got their say in,  and it was determined  that Connor had done it.  Sal,  you said it was Connor.  Yeah,  I did,  because he had previous experiences  of fucking up on the phones. 
[03:45:30]  Now,  Connor had to sit through  the entire audience  berating him  one after another.  You remember that,  right,  Connor?  Of course I did.  So how does it feel  to find out  that Rob was lying  and setting you up?  Um,  it doesn't feel good.  No.  Rob,  why would you do that  to Connor?  I don't know.  It was funny.  It was a good time.  You just,  so Rob,  Roland's making that  shh,  what shh,  you mean,  listen,  hand motion at 
[03:46:00]  Connor.  Let me,  let me explain to you  something about Roland.  Yeah.  You ignore him  because saying  Roland is doing  that hand motion  he does  lets the listeners  at home say,  oh yeah,  because I know  what the fuck  Roland does off the air.  You know what I mean?  Roland does things  that don't relate  at all to the listeners.  He brings up people  that the listeners  don't know.  Exactly.  He's horrible.  Roland is terrible  at radio.  He just brings up  inside references.  He just tries to make 
[03:46:30]  the people in the room laugh  and has no sort of  knowledge whatsoever  that there may be  people listening  who aren't in the room.  That is correct.  You know what I mean?  I try to have a conversation  not only with you  but with the listeners.  Let's all get in  on this together.  I'm not trying to  leave anybody out.  Roland,  on the other hand,  is an idiot.  You know what I mean?  And that's no offense  to you, Roland.  No, take it.  So,  you understand  you'll have to be punished.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  What do we do with you?  Can I just kind of  change the subject  a little bit?  What?  I know where this is going.  Where's it going?  Let me tell the story.  It's fine.  Okay, Rob.  No, no, no.  Is this the story?  Yeah.  You definitely want to hear this.  No, it's a good story.  Eric, you got a cocky  little intern on your hands.  Rob, what's the story?  Well, yesterday  I was downstairs  waiting for Aaron Paul  to come up  just in case he came  or whatever  so I could get him  to the front of the line  and everything  and get him checked in.  and I didn't know  I was waiting 
[03:47:30]  I didn't know  maybe he like  slipped past me  or something like that  and I see Connor  come downstairs  and I just like  I was like Connor  like just trying  to get his attention  all I hear  it's like 9.30  the lobby is packed  all I hear is  sup bro  no, no, no  this is just for us  do the whole physical motion  what's up man  threw his hands up  like  he was  it was just like  I was like  oh my god  and apparently  they said  the whole lobby  turned around  to look at him 
[03:48:00]  everyone just looked at him  why did you do that Connor?  it was his reaction  Connor you don't know  how to assess  the situation  you're in very well  Connor walks into a corporate environment  like he was a big shot  at a party  Troy would just be like  somebody call me  listen  you got one guy  who thinks  the whole world  is bros  and doesn't understand  that he's in a corporate environment  and you got another guy  who just lies  for fun  what are you teaching  these kids Eric?  it's not so much 
[03:48:30]  me teaching them  it's when I talk to them  and all of a sudden  I see little sidebar discussions  with one Sam Roberts  look  if you can't control them  first of all  I'm not training Rob  to be a liar  I'm not a liar  no the liar thing  was brand new  exactly  but the cockiness  and all that stuff  he's getting it off of you  listen  Rob  yeah  I get to be cocky  because I've earned it  you've done shit  I'm not trying to be cocky  it's just how I act  oh my god  this kid 
[03:49:00]  and Connor  and then he's going to grab your junk  yeah  no you're not  no you're not  going to grab my junk  and Connor  you  I feel like you have  the best of intentions  I feel like you want to do well  oh yeah  but for some reason  stuff just turns to shit  in your hands  and you can never understand why  like I feel like  that's your whole thing  like you've got all this gold  and then all of a sudden  you look down  and it's melting into shit  and you're like  what's happening around me  what did I do  I didn't do anything 
[03:49:30]  why is this happening  is that the way you feel sometimes  that's a fair assessment  yeah  yeah  well I mean  number one  I would say  don't shout out bro  at your fellow interns  in the lobby  full of Morgan Stanley employees  and you know  I would say just focus  I think you have the potential  to work through your screw ups  Rob  you're just  a penis tugging  lying  son of a bitch  yeah  you know  is that about right  yeah totally  what am I going to do with you 
[03:50:00]  I was assessing the interns  with Sal  and Sal just reminded me  I said this  and I go  I don't know what to do  I have one intern  who tries too hard  I have another intern  who doesn't try at all  who tries too hard  and then Rob's just there  in the middle  Rob is just there  Rob is Bane  in Batman  Rob is just there  to watch the world burn  we ran out of  you know  main characters  so they're bringing up Bane  and Rob's right there  yeah  what  so you think  Connor tries too hard  that's his problem  oh yeah  it's not a bad thing 
[03:50:30]  it's not a bad thing  no but it can get in your way  like if you're just trying too hard  you lose sight of what you're doing  yeah sometimes  that's fair yeah  have you been criticized  that way before Connor  um not  no  no  what do people criticize you for  what do you say  is something that you'd like  to work on about yourself  what is something  that people have come to you  and say  Connor you're a little  too much of this  or whatever  actually it's more  Connor you don't have  enough confidence  yeah  yeah  and what do you do  to work on that  I have no idea  what to do 
[03:51:00]  to work on that  do you not have confidence  I think it's getting better  but not really  that wasn't a confidence statement  at all  exactly  you are completely  you have a lack of confidence  in your confidence  that you're building  I would  look  here's what you gotta do  just be sure of yourself  regardless  even if you're doing  a shitty job  like look  Rob is not  a fucking prize  no not at all  he's got webbed toes  he lies  he grabs junk  he called  Val Venus  Velveeta 
[03:51:30]  it's a type of cheese  why would they name  a wrestler  Velveeta  I wasn't really thinking  there were a lot of people  calling it  exactly  you weren't thinking  you're absolutely right  you should always be thinking  ABT  always be thinking  Connor thinks too much  he's in his own head  too much  Eric what can I do  to punish Rob  I don't know  this is  I might have to think of it  we gotta think of something  cause nobody knew  that he  that he lied about this  I'm leaving for 
[03:52:00]  somebody's asking  for punishing Rob  with an in-studio screening  I mean that probably  will happen  but I'm not gonna do that today  that's something  I wanna save  plus you have to have  worse than that  you have to have worse  than Connor  so you will get  an in-studio phone screening  but  there's gonna be  something else too  you know  yeah that's fine  you realize  you know  you did something wrong  I messed up  you didn't mess up  you did it on purpose  no  you lied on purpose  oh yeah  I'm not punishing you  for the Velveeta thing  oh I lied on purpose 
[03:52:30]  the Velveeta thing  you're gonna get  phone screened publicly  yeah  the lying thing  is definitely worse  yeah  what did Eric say  I was just  talking with Sal  what if  for his punishment  we have Rob  sitting in here  with his  his webbed toes  propped up  and we just bring in  different females  from around the office  to come in  and comment  and criticize  all the girls  that he's talking to  I know them all  so it's fine  you might do that  see if you can get  some girls lined up  today  if you wanna go do it  today  do it today  I think we should  we don't have enough time 
[03:53:00]  I think we'll wait  till when Sam comes back  you can do at least two  of those first two  down there  nah save it for Monday  save it for Monday  cause we'll be  I'm going to San Diego  with Jim for Comic Con  later this afternoon  so I won't be here  tomorrow or Friday  where will they be able  to hear your stuff  is it gonna be  on Comic Con Radio  or is it gonna be  I don't know  I don't know  what's going on  down there  to tell you the truth  alright  I'll be twittering  at twitter slash  not Sam  and I'll tell you  that way  but I don't know  if our stuff's  gonna be on  Comic Con Radio  or not  either way  we'll have  some kind of  special  next weekend 
[03:53:30]  to air  not this weekend  um  go with  one of your  screen calls  shouldn't  shouldn't Connor  get something  out of this  too though  I mean like  you should get  some kind of reward  yeah  no I got  no no  not a reward  just like maybe  vindication  no  after being forced  to sit here  and screen calls  for being falsely  found guilty  I found that funny  like what  no  see this is trying  too hard  confidence  yeah no  you should  it's okay to not  like it  when people insult you  I don't like it  when people insult me  and you know what  when people insult me  I believe  they're full of shit 
[03:54:00]  you're an asshole  you're full of shit  I know  we'll try to think  of something  you're right  that benefits  like maybe we'll  have girls come in  and we'll ask them  to each give  Connor a  compliment  and Rob  an insult  make fun of Rob  right  please say something  negative about Rob  and positive about Connor  that's what we'll do  that'd be fun  Roland  yeah  any follow up  from yesterday  you came in here  telling people  that you were going  home sick  apparently some people  in the talent department  were not happy  about our 
[03:54:30]  Bryan Cranston booking  I was here all day  yeah you stayed  you were here all day  I left at like  2.30  and you were still here  different places  if you could find me  you found me  if you could  was that by design  oh yeah  yeah cause I noticed  for a large chunk  of the afternoon  I couldn't find you  I know nobody could  but I was in the building  uh yeah  you were just shitting  the whole time  no no no  I wasn't even in the bathroom  I was visible  you had a secret spot though  yes  you won't tell people  cause you might have  to use it again  yeah someone helped me 
[03:55:00]  cause hi  it's a  not hi  but I was in a different  area  so  have you gotten punished  have you gotten yelled at  yeah I mean  alright  has it blown over yet  still  still in the wind  still rocky waters  cause I guess  Bryan Cranston  just did our show  and that made  the talent department upset  that was news to me  yes  yeah  I was shocked  you were  you were surprised  I was  I don't think that's true  but um  well you'll let us know  if you get in trouble  yeah  well of course  oh yeah 
[03:55:30]  is it rough water still  you seem a little hesitant  yeah  still getting dicks in the ass  every now and then  every here and there  it's just one particular person  you don't want to mention his name  you kind of  you want to mention his name  but you know you shouldn't  I won't  unless if he yells at me  then  I'm gonna go  panda crazy  I like when  Rowling gets  yelled at  between 10 and 10.30  because then he comes in here  and he's all like upset  and he says everything  that's on his mind  I go panda crazy  so hopefully  hopefully you'll get yelled at 
[03:56:00]  maybe like Monday  around 10.15  yeah  and then you'll just stumble in here  and start going panda crazy  yeah I will  definitely  and I'll start throwing names  and different examples  about this person  you shouldn't  no but  but I will  you panda crazy  did you  have you been stressed over Comic Con  have you booked us a lot of stuff  yeah of course  Comic Con  this year's less  of everything  less spots  still a clusterfuck though  isn't it  well the thing is  you have  three  you have Comic Con  you guys going  yeah 
[03:56:30]  Comic Con radio  right  and Rotten Tomatoes  Rotten Tomatoes radio  just here  because checking the website  wasn't good enough  yeah so then  but the thing is  you have three people here  I mean three  different shows here  and then  on top of  thousands of bloggers  media outlets  yeah and that's the thing  I noticed that last year  last year was when I really  started to pick up on the fact  that there  I believe there were more people there  with press passes  yeah  than with day passes  that they bought  like there are more  quote unquote  members of the press  than there are fans 
[03:57:00]  because anybody who starts a website  is now a member of the press  yeah so you figure  Expendables 2  they have six  open slots  and then they have  thousands of requests  right  and they don't know  who's legit  and who's not  yeah and then  but then you get the spot  and then  some don't want to do press  some do press  but then you have to wait  in the press line  right  and Jim doesn't want to do that  yeah  and the one on ones  you're going to wait  at least 20 minutes  while everybody's getting interviewed  that's your turn 
[03:57:30]  did you at least enjoy  the EROC segment today  I did not  he loved it  he mouthed the words  I loved it to me  I did not enjoy it  but  he doesn't know I can see him  yeah  glass is clear  EROC  he did get  I talked to him  afterwards  he said  it was a good segment  yeah it was a good segment  you don't have evil intent though  I didn't jump in this one  so I was like  you don't have evil intent  do you Eric  have I ever shown evil intent  I don't think so 
[03:58:00]  but  did you  do you  harbor resentment  towards people on the show  because of the way  you get made fun of  at times  but not  you don't hold it with you  no because  I'm not one of those people  that  that constantly needs  or thrives on the fact that  I have to find something  to fuck over another person  or just to  kind of  knock them down  not even critical  just  when you be  that's almost obsessive  when you're constantly  looking for stuff like that  who do you think is like that 
[03:58:30]  I'm not  that's a loaded question  I'm not going into that  he said Troy in my ear  he said Troy in my ear  I said Troy in your ear  while I was speaking  yeah yeah  that was really bad timing  way to go Roland  who do you think is like that  I'm not  I'm not going into that  we're done with that  see look who's coming  is that who you're talking about  I didn't even  tell me this Eric  I didn't even  I said nothing about him  or even brought him up  do you think I'm like that  he just said in my ear Troy  do you think I'm like that  you're constantly looking for stuff  but am I looking 
[03:59:00]  but is it  you think I'm obsessed with you  no I don't think  it's obsessed with me  it's your obsessive nature though  to do that  I just don't let it go  but you know I do it for fun right  for your fun yes  yeah like I don't actually  sit at home bothered  by anything that you do  Sam's not vicious  at all  I just  that's what I  that's like a game  you bust balls  yeah that's my game  and like just trying to find things  to pick on you for  but I do it like  I don't do it maliciously  or behind your back 
[03:59:30]  like I just do it with you  like we're all just having a good time  I don't understand why  everybody's not laughing  Troy  I mean I don't do it maliciously  you do seem to have  a little more  I don't know if it's  disgust maybe  disgust possibly  I mean I don't  I don't hate Eric  I think Eric's a cool dude  I've been friends with Eric  for a long time  but I think you're more bothered  by some of his lifestyle choices  like what did you think  to yourself  when you found out  that Eric spent the entire  4th of July weekend  eating ho-hos 
[04:00:00]  and watching Mission Impossible  but that's not what I did  I thought it was  see that's another thing  you tend to exaggerate  for the sake of  drawing out a bit  okay  playing Legos  and eating ho-hos  but that doesn't surprise me  no  that was one night  it doesn't  no  but does it  get under your skin  I could care less  I really could  I really could  okay  it's just  it is fun to bust his balls  you know that  it's easy to bust his balls  I have a good time  I have a good time 
[04:00:30]  busting everybody's balls  I mean  for no reason at all  I called you a moron today  yeah  and I've gone  and I mean  I may go after Eric more  but I've gone after  everybody  everybody on the show  I would say so  so  it's not that  and I just had told Eric  you know  look dude  you know like  bust my balls back  go ahead and fire back  I gotta be honest with you Eric  the one thing  that I have to  that you and I part ways on  well there are many things  but this one definitely  is  there is no 
[04:01:00]  way  if Opie left me  at Giant Stadium  yeah  just in the lurch  just whatever  like Opie just is gone  and he isn't coming back  there's no way  I'd be cool with him again  I don't know  I wasn't cool with him  the next day  and it took a while  I don't know how  you're cool with him  Eric forgives pretty easy though  he does  I don't know how you can  forgive him  there's people done  mean shit  you're talking about Roland  you pointed at Roland  when you said that  there's people that have done  some really mean shit  and he 
[04:01:30]  Eric looks past it  in a little bit  if you went to a concert  with Opie  don't play fingers  at the Meadowlands  and he was your ride  yeah  and he just left  like  and that was the goof  like and he didn't come back  and he didn't call you  he just left  would you  would you be able  to forgive that  I mean eventually  I'd probably  I mean me personally  I would probably do something  evil in return  yeah  I mean that's just how  what would you do  ask Roland how I  I fire back  what would you do  to Opie if he did that  I don't know  I have no idea  I'd have to think about it  I would sit there  I'd plot it out 
[04:02:00]  yeah  you would really do  something that hurt  I think Troy  will wait a year  yeah  and then one day  he'll wake up  and go today's the day  yes  according to Troy  he has one year  to get back at you  he's talking about  the wedding gift  yeah  you got a gift  it took more than a year though  well hey  times are tough  yeah  no I actually  and I want to thank you  by the way  for those wondering  yeah but you gave me  over a year  a heads up  Troy did give me  a wedding gift  on my wedding day  so I appreciate  I appreciate  you gave me  you gave me  enough heads up  yeah  that's fine  Eric got his gift  um  you still  but you don't 
[04:02:30]  like when you think  about that day now  you don't get pissed  off at him  it's  that was  seven years ago  dude  I don't  it's just  what are you supposed  to do  I can't live  the rest of my life  like that  first of all  I'd never go  anywhere with him  again  I haven't gone  anywhere with him  so </pre>
