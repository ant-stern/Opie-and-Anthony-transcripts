<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Sam Roberts hosting the after-show in Opie's absence. Opie was busy attempting to film a video with Anthony Cumia (Big A), initially considering a James Bond parody with Big A as 007, then settling on a reenactment of "Hurricane Hippo" from a cartoon. Opie's birthday and the underwhelming apple crumb pie he received instead of cake were discussed.  A fight between station employees Sal and Troy was also mentioned, along with potential company sale rumors.  The "Hurricane Hippo" video shoot involved E-Rock, who vomited after Big A's intense performance. Brooke Hogan made a brief appearance outside the studio. The Three Stooges movie received negative criticism.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Drew Boogie's music, which samples audio from the Opie and Anthony show, particularly Anthony's rants, using auto-tune.  "Bowling for Behave" and "Mimi Beardsley" were highlighted as examples.  Troy Kwan's music production was compared to Drew Boogie's. An animation of "Bowling for Behave" by Coke Logic was shown and praised. A phone call with Bobo followed, expressing anger at Big A for appearing on the show instead of him, resulting in harsh and vulgar responses from the hosts.

A guest, Otto, appeared to discuss his podcast, "Puppies in Sunshine." He detailed guests (including George Carlin and Kevin Spacey), topics, and his extensive show business career.  The podcast's format and success were also discussed.  The segment concluded with information on guests' upcoming performances and websites, and a final mention of "Mimi."

Throughout the show,  there were repeated and crude sexually explicit jokes centered around the name "Mimi Beardsley," used as a punchline.  The hosts also promoted their podcast and social media, announced upcoming shows featuring Ron and Fez, and provided instructions on how to find the show on Facebook.  Much of this segment consisted of nonsensical, repetitive variations on the same sexually suggestive theme focusing on "Mimi Beardsley."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yep.  Yep.  Maybe that'll be my new thing.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Everybody.  It's a great show today, by the way.  Everybody.  It's high-end mini-vacation mode. 
[00:00:30]  Staycation mode.  Except Opie.  I guess he's going to Boston.  But we're going to be gone Friday and Monday.  Not a real vacation.  It's just like one of those...  I think everybody's taking the four-day weekend.  Everybody's very excited about it.  Literally.  The morning, for most of us, employees here at SiriusXM was spent looking at that clock.  As will the second part of the day until we can just go home.  Um, however, I'm glad that I get to spend this hour with you.  Uh, 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969, in case you learned anything. 
[00:01:00]  Um, Opie, what do you need?  You look like you're lost.  I want to do a video with Big A, but I don't know what to do today.  What are you thinking?  Get out of my seat.  What do you mean get out of your seat?  Get out of my fucking seat.  It's not your seat.  It's my seat.  Big A, I want to make a video.  What do we do?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  You're putting a lot of pressure on Big A right now, Opie.  Otto, you got an idea for Big A?  We should do a video.  What length?  Short. 
[00:01:30]  It's all about short videos on the internet.  Three minutes?  No, less.  Two minutes.  Fifty seconds.  Whoa!  Less than one minute!  What can you do in fifty seconds?  Sorry, you and Anthony?  I mean, Anthony?  No, Big A's the big fucking star.  Oh, okay.  Opie's taking a behind-the-scenes role on this one.  I just hate when Big A comes by and then, uh...  You and James Bond, uh, have him play 007.  Can he play...  Walking into the circle and doing that turn.  Can he play 007?  Yeah.  Big A, I like Big A.  There's no, like...  Put a gun on him and give him one of Anthony's guns. 
[00:02:00]  He knows an opportunity when he sees it.  He goes, can you play 007?  Big A's like, hell yeah, I can.  Yes.  Yes, I can play 007.  I want him to reenact, uh...  Big A is doing a gun thing with his hands right now, practicing.  I know he's practicing.  I want him to do Hurricane Hippo during the, uh...  What's Hurricane Hippo?  You know Hurricane Hippo.  No.  Hurricane?  Oh.  Oh, yeah, it's a cartoon.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we got...  I wonder if you can reenact that.  We did get some video...  In Iraq's face.  We did get some video of Big A in Iraq today. 
[00:02:30]  Like, of the, uh...  Of the uncomfortably closed news reading.  True.  All right.  Fuck it, then.  I'm going home, then.  Fuck it.  Did you have a nice birthday?  Yeah, it was a good birthday.  Yeah?  Did you have cake?  Yeah, a lot of cake.  What kind of cake?  I went with the apple crumb pie.  Apple crumb pie?  I know, isn't it?  No, I want to know...  What kind of cake did you have?  Why didn't you have real cake?  I had a piece of apple crumb pie.  Was it good?  That's pie.  Why would you have pie on your...  Because I like pie better than cake. 
[00:03:00]  Nobody made you a cake, though?  No, not this year.  I wish you had told me.  I would have done it for you.  And my son thought it was his birthday, so that's great.  Of course.  Big baker, right?  Yeah, my mom would have made it.  Well, how about you do that?  It's too late now.  I thought your birthday lasts a week in the Hughes household.  Sure.  All right.  Bring some treats in Tuesday for my birthday.  My mom actually will.  You know that.  I know.  That's how needy she is for compliments.  Good.  Tell her I want some kind of apple-y thing.  Apple pie or something.  You already have the apple thing.  I'm not doing the apple thing.  I'm all about the apple pie.  It's going to be some kind of chocolate cake.  Big fucking crumbs on top.  No, it's going to be a cake. 
[00:03:30]  It's your birthday.  It's your birthday?  What kind of cake?  Probably chocolate cake.  Because I like that.  Carrot cake.  Do you like carrot cake?  Sometimes.  She does make a good carrot cake.  Now we're just talking about fucking what cake we like.  Yeah, people are interested.  No, no.  Who cares?  That's incorrect.  Who cares that Otto likes carrot cake?  People are fascinated by guys like you and Otto.  Huh?  People are fascinated by you guys.  But it's not that he likes carrot cake.  They are.  They want to know the details.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:04:00]  This is fucked radio, man.  No shit.  I thought we were just bullshitting in here.  That's the thing.  That's the beauty of your show?  I try to tell...  I used that excuse for many years.  I try to tell Bobby and Joe yesterday that people's expectations of the after show are  so low that you don't have to do anything.  People expect it to be horrible, so when it's at all good, it's a surprise.  It doesn't have to be good.  Ever.  For the best, expect the worst.  Exactly.  Some drink champagne, some die of thirst.  You tell the new bosses that. 
[00:04:30]  I'm sure they'll listen to you.  You keep talking about this thing.  When do you think the company's going to get sold?  I'm surprised it didn't happen already.  Something's going on.  You did.  When did you say it's going to happen within a week?  There was rumors it was going to happen before the board meeting, which happened a couple  days ago.  I don't think anybody else here is talking about that on the air.  Well, because they're too scared to talk.  You've been talking about it a lot.  I'm going home.  I guess we're not doing a video.  Fuck.  Well, you've got to think of something.  Can't we do Hurricane Hippo?  You want to do it right now for him? 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Let's do it right now.  Let's get Iraq in and we'll do it right now.  All right.  Iraq, you want to be a big video star today?  No, I'm good.  Wait, we can do it with Mars.  Nothing.  Mars.  Why does everyone say no to the Hurricane Hippo?  Are you familiar with this Hurricane Hippo?  You just got to give him the text then and he can do it.  Yeah, give me the text for Hurricane Hippo.  All right.  So who's going to do it, though?  It's a whole opening to an old cartoon.  Who's going to be the guy with him, though?  It's got to be Iraq.  Iraq.  Sal's been freaking out about Big A all day.  Iraq's saying no?  Sal has been freaking out about Big A all day. 
[00:05:30]  And Sal and Troy got into a huge fight in the office yesterday.  Sal and Troy?  Oh, yeah.  They got into a huge fight.  Like, it was a fight.  So, like, Troy was yelling at him.  Me and Travis were in there making sure everything was okay.  But Troy was yelling at him so loud that everybody in the hallway was listening.  Don't touch it.  Oh, you're quitting on your video?  What?  You're quitting on your video?  I just heard words, words, words, and I knew that was my cue to get out of here. 
[00:06:00]  Well, you got to listen.  You're not a good...  Words, words, words, words.  You're not a good listener.  Words, words, words, words.  This is why I get stuff on this show.  What?  You're not a good listener.  I have no idea what you were just saying.  Because you weren't listening.  I'm freaking hippo to words, words, words, words, words.  And then you're going to wonder why Sal and Troy didn't fight on your show.  Because I was just telling you about it.  But you weren't listening.  Words, words, words, words.  See, Big A.  And then you're going to go home, and you're going to listen on Tuesday, and he's going to say, 
[00:06:30]  Why don't you give us any of the good shit?  And I'm going to tell him, because he doesn't listen.  Always a pleasure to see you.  Thanks, Ope.  Do something with Otto on the after show.  He's good.  We're doing something right now.  We're talking.  Yeah.  If you get a good video, Otto, fucking, you know, tweet it.  I'll fucking retweet that shit.  Okay.  Absolutely.  I'll retweet that shit.  Retweet me, O.B.  Hey, the problem is, fucking E-Rock should be doing the Hurricane Hippo.  No one else.  E-Rock, will you do it?  Come on in.  E-Rock's going to do it.  My ribs are hurting.  E-Rock's going to do it. 
[00:07:00]  Here he comes.  He's coming in right now.  There he goes.  The headphones are off.  What are we doing?  Hurricane Hippo?  Yeah.  You see, Big A, that's how it works.  If you just keep telling somebody that they're coming in, eventually they come in.  You know what I mean?  Hurricane Hippo is good.  It's like, it'll be a 20, 30 second bit.  Yeah.  And it might fucking go viral.  I need a viral video, desperately, obviously.  Why is that?  Because I've failed miserably at getting viral videos.  I was watching a McGillagorilla marathon recently, because I lost my clicker. 
[00:07:30]  And Mr. Peebles was a different actor.  Like, every cartoon.  How long were you watching for?  I watched like six or seven episodes, just to see the shitty animation.  And over the course of that time, you were never like, I'm going to just stand up and  turn a chance.  No, I thought it was great.  I was laughing.  I actually remembered some of the episodes.  But Mr. Peebles, what's his name?  Mr. Peebles, the owner of the pet store, was Howard Morris from the Andy Griffith show.  Really?  And then like the next one, it would be some other guy. 
[00:08:00]  E-Rock, are you like an old school cartoon guy too?  Or are you just like the new stuff?  Yeah.  E-Rock Barbera, yeah.  He's got them all, but you lose your remote, and then you end up watching a marathon?  No, no, no.  I was joking about that.  I was actually watching it.  I taped it.  E-Rock's got everything on DVD.  He does?  Yeah.  He got all these cartoons on DVD.  What is that?  He just wants attention.  I don't know.  It's the Hurricane Hippo Holler.  Where's that from?  Did he say his name, though, before he does the holler part? 
[00:08:30]  I don't know what he's talking about.  Where's that from?  She's making shit up now.  Shut up.  By the way, Brooke Hogan was outside, she said to say hi.  I forgot.  To me?  I walked out of there, and she pointed, and she said, tell him I said hi.  Specifically to me.  Who?  I'm guessing you, since it's your show right now.  Right.  Right.  I'll be talking to her later for a pre-taped interview.  Brooke Hogan.  She's here?  She was just right outside.  I got her.  She doesn't look bad.  Did anybody see the Three Stooges movie?  No, it looked horrible, though.  Yeah, I refused to go see it.  You're like a Three Stooges fan. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I think it's disgraceful.  Yeah, exactly.  And Big A's got the shirt.  None of their surviving relatives will get any of the money if it does become a series.  Yeah.  And it's like, so what?  They do an impression of Curly.  Right.  They're doing impressions of the guys.  To me, it's the equivalent of going to see a Frank Sinatra Jr. impersonator in a lounge  in Atlantic City, as opposed to seeing...  I mean, I got the Three Stooges on DVD.  Why would I just not watch that?  I wouldn't want to be seen coming out of that movie theater.  They're not reinventing anything. 
[00:09:30]  They're just doing impressions of guys who already did it.  Exactly.  And they were great in the 22-minute form.  You know, their feature films with the actual guys sucked.  Right.  You don't need to see them for anything.  22 minutes, they made their point in and out, you know?  A 90-minute story arc?  Yeah.  You know?  You know?  Exactly.  It's sad.  They should just leave some of that old shit alone.  Yep.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Hey, you want to do this or what?  So he's got to go, this is the Hurricane...  This is all you have to say.  This is the Hurricane Hippo holler. 
[00:10:00]  Where's this from?  And then you have to, like...  Where's this from?  And then you've got to, like, do a...  Right in E-Rock's face.  Where's Hurricane Hippo holler from?  It's a fucking...  That was his, like, superpower.  Yeah.  He would go, oh, oh, and knock people over.  Yeah, the whole room would roll back.  Hurricane Hippo, like a cartoon character.  I don't even know who he is.  I played it for you, but you weren't paying attention.  It was through your phone into a microphone.  We're trying to do a show.  And he's got such energy that he blows people over.  Okay.  There you go. 
[00:10:30]  That's so weird.  Was that in your mind before, just now, when you thought of it?  Yeah.  Were you thinking about that during the show?  Yeah, it was called the Hippo Hurricane holler.  You want me to write it down?  Yeah, please.  I remember that outfit now.  Yeah, give me a pen.  Yeah, his little pith helmet.  His African explorer...  That's great.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  Peterpotamus.  Was he Peterpotamus?  That's where the Hippo Hurricane hollers from.  Now, which studio produced this cartoon?  Was that Hanna-Barbera? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, because it's a doggy-doggy and doggy daddy there, right?  Why don't you do a show about cartoons, Eric?  Peterpotamus.  Because...  And you could have Otto on?  I would do that, maybe.  There are people who are interested in it.  Yeah.  It's one of those things...  I wouldn't want to meet any of them.  Right.  It's one of those...  It's just very niche.  They love niche around here, though.  Niche.  All right, get over there.  Who?  Get right here.  Me?  No, these guys.  Why is he still here?  You're taking shots at Opie today.  So you're going to film...  You need a fan blowing his hair back to one of those big fans on him. 
[00:11:30]  Do you got a holler?  Sorry, it looks beautiful.  Try your holler on, Mike.  Yeah.  Try it out first before we do it.  You see this?  Do you have a large fan?  Because we could just throw some papers in front of it.  And it would look...  This is the hurricane holler.  Oh!  But you really have to exhale when you're doing like...  Yeah, you got to push...  You know what I mean?  There's got to be some...  Maybe some spittle and wind coming out of your mouth. 
[00:12:00]  This is the hippo hurricane holler.  Yeah.  This is the hippo hurricane holler.  Oh!  And then maybe end with this.  Ha!  All the breath has to leave your mouth.  Yeah.  And a little spittle, too.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Don't even worry about it.  It's all good.  Where's our set?  Well, I think that's a good set.  You get some branding in it, right?  Let's get some branding.  Company loves good branding, Otto. 
[00:12:30]  Otto.  All right.  And then, E-Rock, you go over there.  Where are your people?  What am I doing?  What people?  You're just going to take a face full of hurricane holler.  He's going to hurricane holler.  Yeah.  This is enjoyable.  You don't want to stay with me out of here?  What's wrong with you?  It'll be good for you.  Do you guys just have a lot of interns?  Yeah.  Someone has to mic your show.  I'm not micing my...  All right.  So point that mic.  Is Anthony banging those two Canadians?  Yes.  He is? 
[00:13:00]  All right.  One would assume.  All right.  Good for him, man.  One would assume.  One would assume.  That's a great reaction, though.  All right.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Obi.  Obi's gone into destruct mode.  He's the boss.  He can do it.  You're right.  Yeah.  You know what you're doing?  Smash everything.  What the hell is going on?  Thank you, whoever did that in the other room.  What happened?  There was a dial tone on the air because you smashed the phone.  Shit.  Here.  Are you ready to do this or what? 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Obi is going to film.  Who's holding up the script?  Get close, E-Rock.  Put it...  I want the Sirius logo.  Fuck those people.  I want the Opie and Anthony one.  Why not put a little Sirius?  I'll still use this video after I leave this shithole.  Why would you leave?  They...  Everything is so nice.  And they give you money.  All right.  Ready?  Bring it down to your chest.  There you go.  Go ahead.  Look right at E-Rock.  And yell it, big A.  Emotion. 
[00:14:00]  This is the hippo hurricane holler.  You see the bile come up?  Look at him.  Wow.  Look at him.  Oh, E-Rock just fell.  E-Rock is on the floor.  He's vomiting.  Oh, he is vomiting.  A big A.  Way to go, buddy.  Way to go.  E-Rock, how you feeling, buddy?  Get on that mic.  Oh, his face is still red.  How you feeling, little guy? 
[00:14:30]  How you doing, buddy?  I lost use of my legs.  Yeah.  I just went numb and dropped.  Why?  What happened?  I have the antidote.  Smell this skunk vomit.  Jesus.  The ah is one thing where it's coming at you and it builds, builds, builds, and then it stops.  And then the...  Which just punches you in the face.  See, I told you how valuable that would be, big A.  I told you.  Big A.  What is the aroma like?  Aroma?  What's that smell? 
[00:15:00]  Tony Aroma?  What's that smell like?  You know when they don't take everything from your garbage can and there's still stuff left down there?  Oh, the garbage juice?  The hot garbage juice?  Yeah.  Were you drinking garbage juice, big A?  No.  No, he wasn't drinking garbage juice.  He was gargling with raw assholes.  Opie is proudly looking at his video.  Oh, that's great.  I've never even seen you look at your son with that much proudness. 
[00:15:30]  I love my son.  Don't fuck with that shit.  I know you do.  That's funny.  Two years old.  I know he is.  All right.  Thank you, everyone.  I just...  Don't break your head.  Use your shoulder.  Go ahead.  All right.  There he goes.  Down goes Opie.  Oh, gee.  He has...  Remember, what was your birthday yesterday?  Yes.  What was your 30th birthday?  Yes.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Two radio with Otto.  He's really good.  I know Otto.  He's really good.  I'm not just meeting him.  He'll challenge you with some old fucking TV references. 
[00:16:00]  You're way out of his league.  Well, I know that.  Otto and me are from different generations.  You can have fun with that.  I'm a wino.  See you at F.A.S. Riley.  Say hi on the weekend.  See you later, Opie.  Opie's leaving.  Okay.  Happy belated birthday.  Opie's...  Two radio with Otto.  He's really good.  Like, this is my first time meeting you.  Yeah.  Oh.  He's super.  That was funny.  Opie's back.  Yeah.  Now what?  That's my shit.  Oh.  You forgot your iPad.  So you're going to put that video up right now?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  That's very funny.  Did you get the...  You smelled him? 
[00:16:30]  Did you get the CD that Roland gave you?  The Alabama...  Yeah, I'm going to try that.  Shakes?  No, I didn't get that.  You should get it.  Why?  You'll like it.  Well, where is it?  Roland probably has it because you wouldn't take it from him.  I don't know.  You're giving him an attitude.  I'll take it.  Sam, I got my friend Shane out there.  He's a musician.  And my friend Joe Conte, he was a comic.  Do you want to interview either of them?  They can come in.  Yeah?  Yeah, the more the merrier here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Now, Big A, not everybody was happy about your... 
[00:17:00]  First of all, I can't see E-Rock because Opie smashed the monitor.  Take one and one.  How are you doing in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, come on in, guys.  How are you doing in there?  Shane O'Connor, right?  O'Connor.  Shane O'Connor.  Shane O'Connor.  And Joe Conte, who does my podcast.  How are you doing, Joe?  E-Rock, how are you feeling in there?  Oh, that was weird.  I know I said it, but that last...  It punched you in the face, and I went down.  That was worse than the news?  That was worse than the news?  Oh, yeah.  It was building because he hadn't talked in a while. 
[00:17:30]  What do you think is getting that reaction, Big A?  How come...  They're making fun of your stinky vomit breath.  How come the breath is bad?  I mean, you're a clean guy.  Yeah.  You know, you've lost weight.  Yep.  You know, I know...  Big A's...  Don't get this wrong.  Big A has good personal hygiene.  Yeah.  Like, he always comes in here clean.  Yeah.  He brushes his teeth.  He had, what, two cavities.  It was a big deal.  What do you think is producing, though?  Is it just a chemical thing?  I don't know, because I've washed my teeth and, you know, clean it. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Maybe something in his ass is in his stomach.  Is it something in your ass is in your stomach?  Just come up?  Some of that nasty sort of...  There's invisible plaque that the gum...  A dentist told me that's why flossing's important.  Do you floss, Big A?  Yes.  Do you floss...  Big A, don't lie to me.  Andrew, have you been flossing?  Of course.  Do you have gingivitis?  Yeah.  During your hurricane hippo, two trains took a dirt road. 
[00:18:30]  He uses a railroad tie, though.  Yeah, it's not good.  Well, not everybody was happy that you were on the show today, Big A.  He was showing me tweets.  You know Bobo.  Yeah.  Big A was showing me tweets that Bobo is sending Big A threatening tweets saying that  Big A stole his radio time.  He didn't even spell radio right.  He didn't.  R-A-T-E-O.  Of course he didn't.  Why don't you reply to him?  He's got nothing to do.  He's probably listening.  Yeah.  He doesn't understand that, like... 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  ...we bring people in when they have something to promote or when we have something to talk  to them about or whatever.  He was booked days...  I mean, weeks ago, he's been texting me.  I'm looking forward to seeing you.  Yeah.  There was no conversation.  There was no, like...  Let's see.  It's Friday.  We either need to get Bobo or Big A in.  It was just like, hey...  Yeah.  ...we'll get Big A in.  And if he's busy, we won't have Big A in.  There wasn't any...  There's no substitute.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What's Bobo going to do to Big A?  I'd love to know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What could he possibly do to him?  Is he going to attempt to climb him? 
[00:19:30]  Like, what are you going to do?  I got you back there.  I don't know.  He wants me to come to his house to meet his dogs.  Does that feel...  To meet his dogs?  I swear to God.  You've got a full dance card.  You don't have time for that bullshit.  Yeah, exactly.  Send me a picture, you stupid dog.  I'm busy banging whores on a pile of cash.  Did Big A become like a regular part of your online TV show, Otto?  The pig roast?  Big A was an integral part.  He was my couch guy.  You know, the Ed McMahon guy.  Really? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, and we used him.  We inserted him in a lot of sketches.  And Shane was one of my first musical guests.  Yeah.  His band, Bagora, which was...  What was it?  Album of the...  It was Album of the Week on episode 10 of That Metal Show.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, our good friend Jim Florentine.  Yeah.  So you've been on That Metal Show and on The Pig Roast.  Yes.  How did Big A, though, become like an integral part?  Like, at first you probably just wanted to use him for a bit or something.  Yeah, at first he was just coming to the tapings.  And then Bobby Capelli, the show creator, just go, who is that guy? 
[00:20:30]  And they go, he's a celebrity from the Opie and Anthony show.  Everybody knows him in New York.  You consider yourself a celebrity, Big A?  Absolutely.  Not really.  If you listen to this show...  Yeah, people know who he is.  There was just a bunch of cops in the hallway clamoring for his picture.  Taking a picture.  Like a Beyonce or something.  Almost.  Yeah.  So, and then you just, right?  I mean...  Yeah.  Yeah, and then you just glommed on to me. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Never laughed.  That's what it is.  I guess he knows the address now.  He's just going to keep showing up.  Yeah, exactly.  Drew Boogie.  Yes, sir.  You had a great show today.  Yes.  This is your first show in how long, though?  Three years.  How come it's been that long?  Has it been us or you?  It's been me.  Oh, okay.  I just didn't have anything new to do.  I just realized that that would be an awkward question if it had been us saying, we don't  want you.  But I thought that we had always invited you back.  Oh, yeah.  Always.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, I just jumped on the auto-tune bandwagon, so that was new stuff to bring  to the show.  I didn't want to keep doing the same old shit, you know what I'm saying? 
[00:21:30]  I got you.  Oh, that was your stuff?  Yeah.  That stuff's cool, man.  Oh, thank you.  So, are you kind of done for now doing the O&A mixes?  Done for now?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I mean, and now moving on to auto-tune stuff.  No, no.  I could still do the mixes live on the air.  Yeah.  I could mix the stuff that I already auto-tuned.  I did that today.  Yeah.  It sounded awesome.  Oh, thank you.  You know, I do that, and the songs don't have any scratching or anything like that on  this album.  Yeah.  So, it's just going to be stuff that people will get stuck in their heads singing in the 
[00:22:00]  shower and shit like that.  Well, it's funny, because it takes everything to a different level, because people get stuff  from this show stuck in their heads all the time.  That's the idea.  And then you take those little elements and actually make a song out of it.  And so now they have, like, they're singing these awful, terrible phrases.  And, I mean, is Mimi Beardsley the number one catchy song on the CD, do you think?  Well, from today, yeah.  I mean, you know, it started with...  Oh, so these are all Opie and Anthony-related songs?  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  He takes either rants that Ant goes on, usually it's Ant, or Jim sometimes.  Yeah, exactly.  He takes little rants or soundbites that we use a lot of, and he'll auto-tune, and he'll  mix, and he'll make, like, hip-hop songs out of them.  That's great.  It's pretty cool.  That bowling to behave is one of the greatest things I've ever heard.  Yes.  I have to try to top that one.  I hate you, because I used to DJ back in the day, and all I could do was mix two stupid  records together, and you, like, create something.  It's amazing.  Oh, it's so much fun to do, because Ant is a raving lunatic, so, you know, and he always 
[00:23:00]  talks in rhythm, so I just have to take it and auto-tune it a little bit, put some music  behind it, and it comes out perfect.  Because, like, we don't even think that way.  Do you hear rhythm when he's talking?  Like, do you hear this is where the music is?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I hear it.  That's interesting.  You know, as soon as I hear Bowling for Behave, or Mimi Beardsley, or the Mimi Me song,  you know, I automatically hear the melody behind it.  The Mimi Me song?  Yes.  That's yours, too. 
[00:23:30]  That's mine, too.  You also did Good Boy Phone.  Yes, the Good Boy Phone.  Oh, that's right, guys.  The first one that was done, you know, besides the remixes after that.  Right.  When you do something as good as Bowling for Behave, though, do you want to be like, well,  how am I going to, I'm not going to top this for, you know what I mean?  Oh, no, I don't even think that way.  No, no pressure.  Because I know I can top it.  It's just a matter of finding the right stuff to top it.  It's making sure everything comes together.  Yeah.  At all the right times.  What do you think of, Troy has done some songs, too.  I heard the Troy stuff. 
[00:24:00]  What do you think of Troy Kwan's production?  I like Troy.  It's nice and clean.  I like, it's, it's, I hear, you guys play the, the, the Fonz stuff on the air all the  time.  The, um, the penis song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He did the penis song.  He did a couple of Patrice songs.  Yes, definitely the Patrice stuff.  I love that stuff.  Control the boner.  Control the boner.  Because I saw you guys in here.  Yeah.  Control the boner.  And I was wondering if there was any, uh, uh, professional rivalry going on or if it's  just two DJs hanging.  Oh, no.  It's just two DJs, uh, showing respect for each other. 
[00:24:30]  I like that.  He's a good guy.  I like that.  No, Troy, I was just talking to him about wondering, cause you know, Drew Boogie's in  here and here.  Until one of them gets shot after a boxing match.  So far it's peaceful.  Yeah.  It's peaceful right now between you and Drew.  It's just two guys respecting each other's work.  Yeah, he does great shit, man.  It's amazing, right?  Yeah.  Well, it's like one of those things where you see somebody that does good work, you're  like, you know, you can respect that.  Do you feel pressure to hear when you hear something like Bowling for Behave, which is genius  work?  Thank you.  And then to be like, oh shit, the bar just got raised.  Well, that's good.  I mean, you need something pushing you. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And to anybody who wants to do animations, the bar just got raised because of that song  today.  Yes.  Poke Logic, I don't know if you're listening or not.  You'll listen at some point, cause he's a spaz who listens to absolutely everything.  Otter, did you see his Bowling for Behave animation today?  I haven't seen that yet.  Is it great?  Yeah.  Can somebody pull that up?  I want to play that for Otter.  Let me go.  Anyone who wants to jump on it.  Didn't he do the thing for your pig roast?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did the opening animation.  He's great.  He's on our Facebook. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay, go to Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Very creative dude.  And we'll play the song along.  We were playing it earlier today, but I want you guys, all you guys, Otto and your pals,  to see this because...  I hadn't seen it before today because Coke Logic just finished it this morning, you know, really early in the morning.  He stayed up all night doing this?  He stayed up all night to finish it to get it out today, and it was brilliant.  There's nothing like dancing guns.  Yeah, that's what...  There it is.  Could you tilt the monitor up?  Opie kicked it. 
[00:26:00]  Perfect.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Tell this to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Rolling for me, hey.  Tell this to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Somehow, white people are all over the world.  Those are all guns.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it ain't white, hey.  And right by my home, I'm looking at home evasion.  It ain't white, hey. 
[00:26:30]  You sack fuck.  Michael Moore.  Look at this dancing gun.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Rolling for me, hey.  Too late to be, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Put the light up letters in the background.  Black on black, prime.  Black on white, prime.  Remove your hat, lady.  LA gang, LA gang, just wipe each other out.  Black on black, prime.  Black on white, prime. 
[00:27:00]  Fucking behave.  How about you do that?  Make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Tell this to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Rolling for me, hey.  Tell this to me, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Rolling for me, hey.  Tell this to me, hey.  Hero wedding guns.  Yeah.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Rolling for me, hey. 
[00:27:30]  Tell this to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  How great is that?  Coke Logic should interrupt Beyonce getting a Video of the Year award.  Yeah.  For that fucking thing.  That is great.  And I'm telling you, Drew, when you and Coke Logic get together, it's dangerous.  It is dangerous, isn't it?  Yeah, it really is.  Who's on, Eric, should I, who's on line one?  I don't see the name.  Is that anybody I should know or is that just a random person?  That should be a fucking hit.  That was smash.  I don't know when it is.  That was really good. 
[00:28:00]  If somebody has a problem with Big A, he's still on hold.  Oh, okay.  Was that, did Anthony, like, sing that?  No, he was just talking.  Those are just rants from, that's amazing.  It was just him ranting.  On my site, I actually have the videos of the audio that I get all the auto-tune stuff from.  And it was just Anthony going off on Michael Moore.  Yeah.  What's your site?  DrewBoogieRocks.com.  And all the videos up there, free ringtones.  And, you know, you can hear the audio of Anthony going off.  And also, the Mimi Beardsley one, Jimmy doing his JFK impression is on there also, so you 
[00:28:30]  can hear how it is.  But he was just talking and yelling.  He was.  He was just going on one of his rants about black-on-black crime.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, it becomes this melody.  What was the length of time before CultLogic had that, you know, your combined efforts?  I think CultLogic just started that, like, three days ago.  Really?  Yeah, he did it really quickly.  Wow.  And he just stayed up all night finishing it.  Did he finish it specifically because he knew you were coming in?  Yeah.  I told him about it. 
[00:29:00]  Gave him the audio so that he can get it done, you know, for today.  Which screwed him up because, you know, up until that point, he thought that it was going  to be Friday.  And then Travis was like, ugh, we're closing on Thursday.  So he was like, wow.  He's got a rush.  Yeah.  Wednesday night.  So he was up all night.  Yeah.  Well, he did a great job.  Yeah, he did.  And you know what?  He may have stayed up all night, but the result is timeless, isn't it?  Absolutely.  You know what I mean?  Uh, Bobo's on the phone.  Real quick, Bobo.  This is not going to... 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I just want to say, I want to say hi to you guys.  Bobo, why are you mad at Big A for coming on the show?  Like, we just, like, that would be like, that would be like Troy saying, why the fuck  is Drew Boogie getting all this credit?  I'm a DJ too.  Like, Troy is not going to do that because he's like, it's not, Drew is doing a good  job.  I'm doing a good job.  It is what it is.  Like...  I was just upset at that by not being asked to come on the show, but...  You're both just friends of the show.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm over it. 
[00:30:00]  I'm not mad at Big A.  Oh, and Big A is just mocking you.  Big A is making phony tear gestures on his face.  Look, Bobo.  I know you've been calling people...  Bobo.  Bobo's been calling, like, a lot of people around here.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Big A is making fun of him.  Bobo's been calling people, like, behind the scenes, like, office people around here  and talent bookers.  Yeah.  Talent bookers who work for, trying to get on the show.  Bobo, when there's something for you to do on the show, I promise you we will call you. 
[00:30:30]  Okay?  But you can't just, you can't just come on the show because it's been a while and you  want to, because then you just stand there and you go, hi, guys.  And you don't have anything to say.  You know?  It's a show.  We have to entertain people.  I know.  It's just sometimes I have stuff to say, but then it is, all of a sudden, I, all of a sudden  it becomes too late for me to say this stuff.  Why don't you, Bobo, why don't you develop a podcast then? 
[00:31:00]  And then you could say whatever you want all the time.  Well, whatever, right?  I'm going to, I'm going to just wait patiently to what you guys want.  You're not waiting.  When will you start waiting patiently?  It's impatiently is the word you're looking for.  Impatiently.  Yeah, well, it's just, I'm sorry about that.  It's just, I thought that I waited weeks and then all of a sudden.  Yeah, you're going to wait weeks, Bobo.  We're not going to have you on every week.  It's not the Bobo show.  Bobo, here's money, buy bullets, kill Lauren Michaels, report back to us, Bobo, kill anybody 
[00:31:30]  leaving SNL, audience or cast.  Hey, Bobo.  Don't actually do that.  Hey, Bobo.  Nobody wants to see your dumb dick anyway.  Whoa!  Wow!  The bar has been raised.  Bobo, that's got to sing.  Big A, what the heck is wrong with you, all right?  They've been nice to you, all right?  No, he stung you back, Big A.  He got you real good with that one.  Listen, Bobo.  You know, Bobo, you could, like, not brush your teeth for a month and then come in and 
[00:32:00]  breathe in Sam's face.  That might work.  Yeah.  Sam won't like it, but he doesn't understand that, no.  He's sitting there and going, oh, okay, yeah, okay, I won't brush my teeth.  Okay, yeah, I'm going to do that.  He already threw his toothbrush away.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo, so why don't you, this is my advice to you, start your very own podcast  and get it online, and that way, all these people who are just clamoring to hear more  of you.  Why is he fixated on Big A, like, is that, like, his, um, does he compare himself to 
[00:32:30]  him as a guest or something?  Is that what it is, Bobo?  Everybody's unique to themselves.  Right.  Well, it's just, I thought I would...  You've never been in a Spike Lee movie.  Why aren't you upset about that?  What the fuck does Big A have to do with him?  It's a retarded version of Unbreakable, that's what it is.  Hey, Bobo, how about you go back to blowing Mr. Malumikens?  Oh, that's your dog!  Troy, you heard what he said, right?  That was rough.  I'm yet more angry.  Yeah.  He used the word yet. 
[00:33:00]  I don't blow dogs.  Okay.  All right, Bobo got a good retort.  He does not blow dogs.  So, Big A, factually, there were some errors in your statement.  He got that out without stuttering, didn't you?  Listen.  Yeah.  Listen.  I'm a holly in it, whatever the fuck that was.  Bobo, you're going to, for real.  Start your own podcast, okay?  Well, I'll wait patiently for you.  You know, you don't even listen.  Oh, thank you.  There we go.  We're all done.  Kill yourself.  We're all done.  Kill yourself, Bobo.  We're all done.  He's highly suggestive.  You know, this is the one person you can't... 
[00:33:30]  Okay, I'll kill myself.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Yeah, don't do anything that was suggested to you, Bobo.  Just talk him through your phone and pretend it's recording.  I don't know what to tell you.  There you go.  I don't know what to tell you.  So, how's your podcast doing, Otto?  Speaking of podcasts, you entered the podcast world.  Joe, you're on it with him.  Well, the thing is, I'm not one of those guys that can fill up a three-hour show.  I'm good as, like, you know, I have an occasional good comment.  But Joe Conti and Kenny Michaels have been doing their own show for, like, seven, eight years now. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, okay.  So, they said...  And we're all good friends, so, you know, we brought Otto in to be, like, you know, the person.  Because people are fascinated by him.  Absolutely.  And the only place he ever really gets to be himself is on this show.  Well, people don't even realize, like, you've been in show business forever.  610 years now.  It's frightening.  The photos on your...  I have no money.  The photos of you from when you were a kid and you're on the street.  You've been doing your gig for 610 years. 
[00:34:30]  Like, it's...  There's a lot.  I started at 14.  I'm 51 now.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that's a lot of time.  Yeah, there's not a mathematician in the room, apparently.  Everybody's staring at Otto going, hurry up, come up with a number.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you're doing this podcast.  Well, how long is the podcast?  Well, we set it at an hour, but we go over a little bit.  It's a lot of fun.  And, like, we planned some shit, but then we just, like, last show, we talked about Curly 
[00:35:00]  for an hour and a half, right, pretty much.  And then Burt Reynolds and then George Carlin.  Yeah, we had a good thing on Burt Reynolds, and then we segued into a Carlin tribute, right?  Yeah.  I was speaking to George Carlin's daughter on the phone recently.  I'm name-dropping now.  But she called me, and she was just telling me, you know, her father was a huge fan of  mine and used to play stuff for, because I met him once, but I thought, you know, I  left his thoughts after, you know, we parted ways.  But apparently he dug, he, like, kept playing my stuff to her, which I thought was kind of 
[00:35:30]  abuse.  I don't know how old were you when he was playing this, you know?  It's like, it seems a little wrong.  Yeah, but his meeting him was Carlin driving two hours out of his way to go see Otto at  a show, and Otto didn't even know he was there, or else, well, he said, you know.  And if I knew Carlin was in the back of the room, I would have completely choked and fumpered  through my act, because he's such a brilliant mind.  I go, oh, he's going to analyze that joke, and he's not going to like the way I went, you  know, the segue and all that, you know? 
[00:36:00]  I was much better off not knowing he was in the back of the room.  That would be like having, you know, Bruce Lee watching you punch a bag and try to  impress him or something, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's the other fascinating thing about you, is that, like, you have a lot of fans that  you wouldn't expect to be Otto and George fans.  Yeah, Kevin Spacey.  Really?  Yeah, I want to murder him, because Kevin Spacey's a fan of his.  Yeah, David Copperfield, who I've become kind of friend, not, I wouldn't say friends, but  friendly, I said, how did you first know about me? 
[00:36:30]  He said, Kevin Spacey used to quote you all the time.  I go, how does a fucking Oscar winner know who the fuck I am?  I'm doing a ground round in New Jersey next Friday.  It's just weird.  I guess the internet makes everything more.  I want to know what quotes Kevin Spacey is doing.  I don't know.  Filthy, disgusting, vile.  It's probably the lowest of my act.  I would love to hear Kevin Spacey call your mudderscunt.com.  Yeah.  That would be the greatest thing.  Kevin Spacey yelling, suck a cock everywhere he goes. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Or somebody yelling that at him.  And Penn Jillette's a big fan of yours, right?  Yeah.  He's used me in several of his projects.  He had a show on FX called Sin City Spectacular.  I was on that.  I was in The Aristocrats, which he was one of the creators.  And I was in an episode of Bullshit.  I think it was season five or six.  It was on Exorcism.  Exorcism, debunking Exorcist.  So I was on that thing.  So he's thrown me a lot of gigs. 
[00:37:30]  Was it a lot of Vegas people that appreciate what you do?  Did people just like the kind of showmanship of it?  It seems like...  I don't know.  I'm just...  I'm off the...  I'm off...  I'm not comparable to anybody else, I guess.  Yeah, I would definitely say so.  Yeah.  They used to always come...  When I played in Vegas, I met...  You know...  Who did I meet there?  Like, just anybody in town that could make it over to the Riviera by the time I...  Because I would start late, like 1 a.m.  That my show would begin.  So guys would be able... 
[00:38:00]  Who were working in town could finish their gig and then race over there.  Yeah.  Penn Jillette used to bring, like, 40 people in two nights in a row.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  And you met John Lennon when you were performing, didn't you?  Yeah, Lennon loved me.  He only saw me once.  I used to see him in the park all the time.  But that one time he stopped was great.  Yeah.  And I think I handled it well.  Even though later on I was...  I was just talking to a Beatle.  I went, holy fuck.  Did you appreciate him at the time as much as...  Oh, absolutely.  I knew he was a worldwide iconic figure. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  But I was a pretty cocky kid.  And I knew I had just done a good show.  So we had a little...  I used to wear a derby in those days.  He asked me where I got the derby.  And he gave me two bucks.  Everybody goes, did you save it?  I was like, I didn't know the guy was going to die.  He...  No, I stank it.  I fucking bought a gyro later.  Fucking...  He's in the park all the time.  He figured you'd get a couple bucks later.  Yeah, like I knew he was going to get blown away fucking few years later. 
[00:39:00]  It sucked.  I didn't...  I was...  I'm sorry I didn't get a picture with him, no.  You know?  Yeah.  But they didn't have...  This was in the late 70s when I was a teenager.  And they didn't have disposable cameras then.  And I was in the middle of Central Park.  Right.  There'd be no way to get it.  Right.  Um, so that was cool.  That was great.  He, um...  I met him during a bad part of his life when he was, like, coming off heroin.  He wasn't recording.  And it was before he had, um, Sean, his son.  So I felt...  When I read his biography, I felt good that I at least cheered him up for the moment during a bad period in his life. 
[00:39:30]  Were you dirty then?  No, it wasn't...  I didn't say fuck or cock or anything.  Yeah.  Um, George was insulting, but no, I didn't swear a lot.  It'd probably be difficult as a street performer.  Yeah, yeah.  Very hard, yeah.  And do the JFK routine.  Yeah.  Um...  So what...  So, uh, how often does a podcast go up and when can people get it?  Where?  They could, um, hear any of the shows we've done so far if they just go to Puppies in Sunshine. 
[00:40:00]  It's puppiesinsunshine.com or you can just go on iTunes.  It's on the comedy scene, uh, under that, uh, RSS feed or whatever they call it.  But...  Do you like the freedom of being on a podcast?  Like, I feel like it's a great thing for a lot of comedians.  It's a, it's a really good...  I've done a lot of podcasts where I feel like I'm speaking into a dead mic or I don't, I don't  know if there's a single soul listening to it.  You know, I go, what am I doing in this guy's fucking basement?  But at least with our show, there's a guy in Florida checking in, like, we had like five, 
[00:40:30]  six thousand people.  Even though it's a, even though it's a podcast, if we broadcast live on a network called more  like radio.com.  Oh, so you do have a live audience.  If, if, yeah, if, if they have a spot open, because it's whenever his auto's available.  So if auto's available, we go there.  If they have a spot open, they'll broadcast us live.  Yeah.  And then, um, and then we, of course, podcast it and, you know, his name, people are like  really clamoring, if I may, to, to really hear him, uh, be himself.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Jim Florentine said he was going to do our show, uh, the next show we do.  So we're going to have some famous people on.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, that's the thing about the dead mic thing is right on because I started,  I started podcasting and it's just me in my living room.  Yeah.  And it's like, you have to just, I, I resigned myself to the fact that I, nobody's listening to this.  So I'll just do it for myself.  Did, did, did you really, I mean, um, I guess you got to start somewhere, but, um, I mean,  you're known from the show, so I'm sure absolutely you must've had thousands of listeners the first 
[00:41:30]  time.  There's some people listening, I guess, but you know, I, I, I'm not sure and, and I don't  get a huge amount of feedback on it.  So it's just like, I'm just doing it just to see what happens.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the beauty of, you could do it anywhere.  It doesn't matter where you're doing it from.  There's no visual component to it.  Right.  But, um, like, why is Mark Maron so hugely popular in his, his podcast?  Why is he the, I think cause he was the first to do it.  Oh, okay.  It's like those people, like if you were on Twitter early on, you got a lot more followers 
[00:42:00]  than you do if you were later on.  Like, cause he was the first comedian to do it, to do the comedian interviewing comedian  podcast.  Like now that's kind of, that was brilliant of him.  So he, what do they say above a head of the curve?  I guess so.  Yeah.  And, and now, cause now he's getting like, he gets like Hollywood people on.  Yeah.  I did his show in Brooklyn.  He taped in some club.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  And then he, people were paying to go and see the live tape.  And so I, I squeezed him for some money.  I did.  I said, I need some cash for this. 
[00:42:30]  You fuck.  I'm not famous and rich yet.  Did he pay you?  Yeah.  He gave me like 200 bucks.  Well, if people are paying to see him.  I went and ate at Randazzo's in Cheap's Head Bay, which is about the price of eight shrimp  there.  But it's very expensive, delicious food.  If people are paying to see him interview you, they're paying to see you, right?  Uh, I don't know.  No, I don't think they knew I was coming.  I just, I just shook him down.  You just wanted the two bills.  Well, listen, um, check that out at puppiesandsunshine.com.  Thank you.  Pigroach.tv is still where you can get all the season one episodes. 
[00:43:00]  Thanks, Sam.  My pleasure.  Thank you for sticking around.  Thanks.  And me and Shane will be drunk in a Midtown bar in moments from leaving this mic.  This Sunday at 4 p.m. is the Sam Roberts show on this channel.  It's live.  Uh, Otto, I appreciate you tweeting in a couple of shows ago.
