<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics.  The show began with a discussion centered on Roland's erratic behavior in the office, including his helium inhalation from balloons, destruction of office supplies, and the throwing of pens and other objects at coworkers.  This led to a broader conversation about Roland's personality and his unique relationships with celebrities.  The hosts discussed their own experiences networking and "schmoozing" with famous individuals, contrasting their approaches with Roland’s unconventional methods.  Anecdotes were shared, including one about Eric's relationship with Sean Hannity.  A caller challenged Anthony about prioritizing Roland's calls over listeners', sparking a discussion about the show's internal dynamics and Anthony's perceived status.  Roland's unique background and access to the entertainment industry were further examined, and the hosts compared various celebrity friendships they had cultivated.  The segment also briefly touched upon a past appearance by the band Jet.

The show then featured a live studio performance by Jet, playing "Skin and Bones."  The hosts humorously claimed the performance almost caused the band's breakup, likening it to the difficulty of canceling a cell phone contract.  They recalled a prior embarrassing experience with Finger Eleven due to a sound equipment malfunction.  The conversation shifted to a fervent desire to have Jack White perform on the show, with one host expressing extreme enthusiasm, even suggesting he’d skip his wedding or get a Jack White signature tattoo while in his wedding suit.  The segment concluded with a crude discussion about Opie's bathroom habits, specifically his alleged habit of leaving urine on the toilet seat, and a preview of the next day's show featuring Pauly D from the Jersey Shore.  Earlier in the show, the hosts also mentioned studio visits from Shaq and Aziz Ansari.  Shaq's interaction with the staff and his interview were highlighted, while the hosts criticized the inadequate "one-sheets" prepared for the guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Here is sex out.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Roland is in trouble.  Opie's pissed.  You just said you were pissed at him.  I gotta go.  You just said you were pissed at him.  I gotta go.  It was Eric, though.  He told me...  Well, Opie said he was upset with you.  I...  I...  I'll explain why I'm really pissed off at Roland. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  I will give you my views on Shaq and how cool he was.  And I will talk about Aziz, who did our show for the first time.  All on my Twitter, Opie Radio.  You know you have a radio show.  Huh?  You know you have a radio show.  You have a whole channel here.  Aw, nice.  You could share some of those ideas right here.  Nice.  Sam, in my defense, you know I do stupid things when I have too much sugar.  That's true.  At random times.  That's...  That's very true.  That is my innocence. 
[00:01:00]  Opie's taken off.  It's like you recorded me when we find a Paul.  I didn't know you were still recording me.  You did kind of know.  No, I didn't know you recorded me.  You kind of...  Because the phone was right on the table.  Why else would it be there?  Because you clicked on the button and thought I'd stop.  No.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah, um...  I miss it.  Apparently, uh...  Oh, could you pass me that pad?  How many hits does it have?  Like a thousand?  Well, I don't even know.  I haven't even seen it myself yet.  Apparently, E-Rock did a video with Roland where Roland was sucking helium. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Is that what the video is?  Yeah.  I didn't watch it.  And even in Eric's defense, I was sucking helium.  I didn't know he was recording it.  You were playing up to the camera.  And why would that be in Eric's defense anyway?  And you shit.  None of that...  He was doing it before I even started taping him.  I was walking down the hallway and other people were waving me in to come and check this out.  And Roland's just sitting there drinking helium balloons.  Yeah.  Where were the helium balloons from?  From the...  From the Mini Cooper...  Somebody brought us something last Friday. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, okay.  I wasn't here that day, I don't think.  Yeah, somebody brought us something and it came with balloons and Roland took them back  to his office.  Besides from stomping on them and throwing things at them, the ones that were left, he  started to bite into and drink.  No, I'm around.  I popped them.  I didn't pop them.  You popped some of them?  No, I popped zero of them.  How come?  Because I went to suck all the helium out of them, all of them.  So you just started taking the balloons and biting them and sucking all the helium out?  Correct.  Just to hear your voice sound funny.  Well, Liam goes, hey, try it out.  Let me hear your voice.  Log on. 
[00:02:30]  Can you hear his voice on the video?  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to see.  Yeah, turn the computer on and turn the back monitor on, too.  The one that's facing me because we had to turn the monitors off when the great Aziz  Ansari and Shaquille O'Neal were in here.  Yeah, that one.  It's the great Matt Fastow listening.  The intern broke my clipboard if you order me more, please.  I guess he's who handles office supplies.  The great Matt Fastow.  Roland was in here during the commercial break because he thought it would be funny.  He was actually just smashing his plastic clipboard against the console because he said they'll 
[00:03:00]  order me three more.  That is incorrect.  Is it?  Yes.  I just made that up.  Fucking liar.  I just made that up.  Don't throw it.  You just broke your pen.  I got another one.  You go through office supplies here.  Because am I angrier?  That office of Roland, it just smashes things and destroys things that the company gives him  for fun.  I find pens hidden behind the blinds because he threw them across the room and they would  land in there.  So as soon as you go to pull up the blind, all these pens fall out. 
[00:03:30]  That's Roland's whole goof is he just sits there in the office while E-Rock's doing work  and he throws pens at, well, while E-Rock's sitting in the office and he throws pens at  E-Rock, but right above him.  So they hit the blinds as hard as he can.  That's not true.  I'm making that up too.  Yeah, you're making that up.  You're just being a fucking liar today.  It all seems like a lot to make up.  He throws stuff into the hallway too.  Yeah?  Well, yeah, can I get stupid emails from stupid people?  Who's stupid?  Or there'll be people out there having conversations and he'll go, shut the fuck up and throw something 
[00:04:00]  out into the hallway.  I know he had a stupid conversation.  He goes, hey, what'd you get?  Let me go, Sally.  What'd you get?  Shut up.  Are the stupid people who send you stupid emails the same ones who wear tight pants that  you weren't mentioning before?  No.  Different people.  Different people.  All right.  This is what YouTube channel.  Is this on mine or Opie's or yours?  Just go to the Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Or E-Rock Radio on YouTube.  I don't know why that's funny.  Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for the plug.  Facebook page.  Yeah.  Is that on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  And this is rolling.  Hey, what's going on again?  Hey, where are you?  Hello?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  It's creepy.  I wish I'd be, I wish I'd be.  Hiya, Pete.  That's the creepiest thing in the world.  There's now a crowd outside the door watching this.  Hey, Ray Charles.  Listen to him giggle.  It's creepy, man.  Hi, Ray Charles.  What's up?  Casey's in the house. 
[00:05:00]  Oh my god, that's weird.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hear the end here.  Okay.  Bye.  Oh my god.  Woo.  Head rush.  You get yourself all fucked up on helium?  Yeah.  Look, he's sweating and panting.  Of course he is.  I had like six balloons or seven balloons.  And what time was this on Friday? 
[00:05:30]  Noon.  You know how I get it.  Yeah, everybody's going in for their lunch hour and boom.  Boom, I'm ready to suck balloons.  You're ready to suck balloons, your smash office supplies, or whatever it is.  I don't smash office supplies.  Well, yeah, I just saw you smash the clipboard.  E-Rock, didn't he smash the clipboard a minute ago?  He didn't?  He did.  I don't know what he did with it, but yeah, he was smashing it right on the corner of the console.  Right.  Okay, good.  I'm not crazy then.  You're crazy.  Both of you are crazy.  Loco.  Loco.  Do you realize how creepy your laugh is when you're on helium?  Like, your voice doesn't sound, honestly, I don't think your voice sounds that different 
[00:06:00]  on helium.  It goes an octave higher.  It goes about an octave higher, yeah.  Like, it's a dramatic change for most of us, but you kind of have a little helium effect  on your voice naturally.  I know.  So the voice doesn't change, but your laugh is so bone-chillingly creepy on helium that  I don't ever want to hear it again.  Aw.  It's scary.  It's scary.  Did you realize that?  No.  It's frightening. 
[00:06:30]  Aw.  Don't say aww to me.  I mean, just don't do it again.  Do you suck balloons a lot?  No.  There's like 15 balloons.  I'm like, ah, let me see what this is.  What else am I going to do with them, right?  No, Liam goes, try it.  See what you sound like.  I go, I haven't done it in years.  So I start doing it.  He goes, do it again.  It's like an old pastime.  Yeah.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  You might as well do it.  It's Friday, right?  Yeah, we have the guests all booked up for this week, so.  And you and Troy still haven't gone for your massage with a hand job yet, huh?  No, he's getting his rhinoplasty right now. 
[00:07:00]  Troy is out all week getting a nose job done.  Something that he's breathing or. . .  No, I think it's a cosmetic surgery.  It is a cosmetic surgery.  You know that, right?  Oh, we all know that.  Yeah, we all know that.  He makes all the excuses he wants to.  But Troy is a vain guy, and yes, he is out all week getting a nose job.  And then tomorrow he goes to, like, that spa to relax, to recoup back into the workplace.  I understand.  I understand.  Very Hollywood of him.  Yeah.  Today was a big guest day for you, Roland.  Yeah.  Shaquille O'Neal was in studio. 
[00:07:30]  Check attack.  And he was great.  I think. . .  And I think he dug the show, too.  I think he was feeling the vibe.  I think he had a good time.  Came in tired.  And, hey, but like Shaq said, Shaq started the interview by saying he has the greatest sense of humor of anyone.  He's got the best one.  And, I mean, it seemed like he was down to laugh.  Yeah.  You know, and he got the show's sense of humor after not too long.  And, yeah, it was a great interview.  Downstairs, people are like, hey, what's up, Shaq?  And he just kind of looked at them and looked away. 
[00:08:00]  He's like, hey, Shaq.  Did you see him when. . .  Shaq is what they called him?  Shaq.  Shaq.  Shaq.  Shaq.  Shaq.  Shaq attack.  Shaq.  Are you on Helium?  No.  You were downstairs with him?  Yeah.  So is it crazy?  Yeah, all the. . .  Of course, everybody's like, hey, what's up?  Want to give him the high five?  Yeah.  He's like, what's up?  But he seemed friendly.  Yeah, I mean, when you're trying to wake up and drinking your coffee and some. . .  Oh, this was before the interview?  Jackoff from like a. . .  Jackoff? 
[00:08:30]  Jackoff from like Merrill Lynch.  Like, hey, buddy, I do golf.  Hi, high five.  And he just takes the elevator up like a normal person.  Oh, yeah, with those douchebags.  And the one guy like looked, like trying to act normal.  He goes, what's up?  That's the thing.  And I just went, ew.  Oh, so he tried to like relate to him like him and Shaq were both normal people.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I just went, ew.  And he just smirked.  You said that?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  That guy's an asshole.  That's how you pointed it out.  You're an asshole.  You're an asshole, sir.  Yeah.  That's got to be a crazy thing, though, because it's one thing to be a highly recognizable celebrity 
[00:09:00]  walking around New York City.  It's another thing to be a highly recognizable celebrity that's 7'1", 300 pounds.  Yeah, he was super tall.  Like, there is no, and he said it in the interview today, since he was 15, there is nowhere he  can go where he doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.  Yeah.  I mean, somehow he's developed a sense of humor that's probably enabled him to get through  a lot of situations that most people would find unpleasant.  But, I mean, he took it all in stride, didn't he?  Yeah, there's a lot of people out there waiting for him.  And Aziz was on, too. 
[00:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  He was great.  Yeah.  It's been a while trying to get him on.  How come he hasn't been on before?  Parks and Rec.  He was in L.A. now, back in New York.  He's a busy guy.  Yeah.  Um, they were making fun of the one-sheets that we give.  First of all, the sheets...  Don't you do that?  Yeah.  Oh.  And those are...  Is it proper or no?  Huh?  Did you put enough in full?  They're not biographies.  Yeah.  None of...  They're just hit points.  Right.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim, they don't read them until right before the interview or while the 
[00:10:00]  interview is going on anyway.  In your defense, we used to do biographies, then they said, enough.  Enough.  Just do a one-sheet.  Yeah, this is too much information.  Just do the bullet points and we'll figure it out.  Just the basics, right?  Yeah.  Just something you can glance down at, glance down at, talking point, boom.  And that suffices to me.  Now...  You used to do three pages and then a one-sheet.  And you used to, like, print out all this stuff and, you know, details and they basically...  We're not going to read all this, is what they said. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  So we stopped doing the long...  And we stopped doing the long guest, you know, information sheet.  This is going to pop up in today's meeting.  I hope it does.  You know?  I hope it does.  We should do some more.  Yeah.  Because...  Okay.  Because, yeah, we used to do these long information sheets.  They didn't read them and they were annoyed looking at all the words.  So they told us to just do the basics.  Just bullet points.  So you start doing bullet points and now the only time they read them is when they want 
[00:11:00]  to make fun of it.  Like, they don't actually read it for the information, usually.  And when they do...  It's like a surprise.  Oh, shoot.  You were in that movie.  Yeah.  Right.  But when they do read it and actually get information and use it for the interview,  they don't make a big production of it.  And so, you know, in the meetings, they don't go, oh, good job with the one-sheet.  Blah, blah, blah.  No.  No.  They just assume...  You get pooped on.  They just assume that because it's only vocal when there's a criticism for it...  And by the way, you could read... 
[00:11:30]  If you read the information on today's Aziz Ansari sheet without a sarcastic tone, you'd  be like, okay, sounds adequate.  And that's all I was going for.  Adequate.  They don't want exceptional.  Yeah, because he's friends with Jimmy and that.  So you kind of...  Exactly.  If you want to go in-depth...  I don't have access to pre-interview these people.  This is not David Letterman.  Yeah.  I don't have access to call them at home and say, tell me a little bit about yourself.  And get the...  I have the internet.  Well, because pre-interviews for TV that people don't realize, it happens like probably two, 
[00:12:00]  three, sometimes four weeks in advance.  Right.  So like a research department will do a whole packet.  The segment producer will go over the whole packet.  And then they'll hand it back to the research department.  We'll break it down.  And then when they call them on the phone, they'll talk and put the bullet points together.  And...  But this is like three, four weeks in advance.  And with the one-sheets, the reason we don't hear about them until the interview is happening  is because they haven't been looked at before the interview.  I could correct mistakes with some kind of notice.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  You know what I mean?  What mistake did you do?  Well, there wasn't any mistakes.  They just said, this is not good.  These are horrible.  And everyone's like, what?  Did you say, did you see Parks and Rec?  What's up?  Exactly.  And then at the end of the interview, Opie goes, yeah, and Parks and Rec is coming back  on April 19th.  Boom.  Pulled right from the sheet.  That information was right on the sheet.  It was a great show, too.  And I think the fact that he's friends with Jay-Z and Kanye West is a major talking point.  Massive.  If I was interviewing him, I would talk to him a lot about that.  And maybe he wouldn't like that. 
[00:13:00]  I know Tom Hoppa...  They travel together.  Tom Hoppa was wondering why I wanted to talk to him more about the fact that Rob Zombie was  directing his comedy special than the fact that he was doing a comedy special.  That's fine.  But if I'm here, I get to pick the questions.  I would think, though, that's compelling to me.  You wouldn't think...  You see Aziz on, like, you know, Parks and all this stuff.  You wouldn't think he's friends with Jay-Z and Kanye West.  But all of a sudden, he's in the Otis video just chilling.  Like, if I was friends with Jay-Z and Kanye West, it's all I would talk about. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  People would get sick of it.  They'd be like, we know.  And I'd be like, well, let me tell you again.  I'm friends with Jay-Z and Kanye West.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Because he's traveled with them and everything.  That's cool.  Do you think...  You've met a lot of famous people.  Yeah.  Have you ever...  Have there been famous people that you would consider, like, friends?  Some...  Yeah.  I mean, like, if you haven't seen them...  Like, it's like comics.  If you haven't seen them in a while, if you've seen them at award shows, like, hey... 
[00:14:00]  Text buddies?  Yeah, you get caught up and everything.  Who's one of your famous people that you would consider, like, one of your boys?  And I know it's not like...  Because they're famous people.  The reason they're famous is because they're busy.  If they weren't busy, they wouldn't be famous anymore.  Yeah.  So it's not like Roland can just call and hang out.  I'm not going to test you on it.  But just like somebody...  Like, the Carson Daly's, the Joe McHale's, and Gerard Butler's, and, like, the kids of  the world.  Gerard Butler is somebody that you're cool with.  Yeah.  So you'll text back and forth with him.  Yeah.  On, you know, not every day, but... 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  ...in situations.  Does that make it so that your regular friends are not as important?  No.  It just makes it seem like you're like, all right, this...  If it wasn't for your job, per se, and what you have to do, they probably wouldn't give  you a time of day.  You realize that.  Yeah.  It's like bubble world.  If you realize this is what you do, and they're very nice people, they want to be your friends,  that's great.  But you have to realize outside of that is what really counts. 
[00:15:00]  Because, like, for me, I'll get a phone call from Johnny Fairplay from Survivor, and after  that, somebody can call me who's never been on TV, and I'm like, who the fuck do you think  you're calling?  I'm friends with Johnny Fairplay.  Oh, Anthony's on the phone.  Ant, why don't you have the hotline?  I don't have the hotline number.  What do you think I am?  Well, so what the show has turned into...  Yeah.  ...is you lambasting me and Opie, while we're not saying... 
[00:15:30]  ...there...  That's right.  ...and making excuse after excuse as to why your one sheet stinks...  Well, listen, first of all...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The one thing I heard that was accurate in that whole diatribe you laid out there to  Roland, you're flunky, is adequate.  You are adequate.  Adequate.  I don't describe you to a piece, Sam.  No.  You're adequate.  No.  You're doing just enough. 
[00:16:00]  I was talking about the sheet, not me.  It's your sheet.  The one sheet was adequate.  But, Anthony, you have requested...  You want me to get to the point where I'm just writing name, time, and plug for you.  You don't want any information whatsoever.  That's exactly what...  I have never complained about the one sheet.  I don't complain about the one sheet.  No.  I don't give a flying fuck on it.  I don't even know who would get this coming in half the time.  They walk in the door, I'm like, oh, this is cool. 
[00:16:30]  This is a surprise to me.  Because that's the way...  That's the way I think the show works.  That, like, I just say, here's the name of the guy, and whatever information you want  to find out, you'll be like, tell me about this.  Yeah, I figure I'm taking the listener's point of view on this thing.  Like, they don't know who it is, I don't know who it is, so I kind of ask questions that  the listener would, like, hey, what do you do?  Yeah, what do you...  What brings you into the studio today?  Right.  What makes you famous?  Like, Monde in a Family? 
[00:17:00]  What's your show about?  Tell me about your show.  What's that show about?  What is this, drama, comedy?  I just thought you were spending an awful lot of time explaining yourself, Sam Roberts.  Well, I think it's important that the listener get to...  Again, I take the viewpoint of the listener, and they want to say, hey, what's that guy's  perspective on things?  That doesn't fit at all what you're talking about.  You're making nothing but excuses for your adequate work.  Well, listen, and tomorrow he'll make another one, she. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, have you started prepping for the big Pauly D interview tomorrow?  Oh, Pauly D's in tomorrow?  I have no clue.  Where was my email?  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, probably in your email box.  I think every so often.  And, by the way, while we're working on this, let me address Roland for a second.  Roland, I saw your email about one of the guests, and the way you word an email, you think you're  being clever when you say certain things and you're really pumping the person up. 
[00:18:00]  Like, we'll read it and go, I don't think I'll...  Well, look what Roland said.  Well, of course we'll take this person.  The thing you're going to do is put the name down and what they do.  You don't have to sell them.  This is a very popular show.  And if you take this person, or, you know, there's another person on the show that's asking for a little place.  So, if we get this, we'll probably get...  Just tell us who it is, Roland. 
[00:18:30]  Roland, I think they're starting to see through the, well, if you take this person, you're more likely to get that person when it doesn't...  No, that one doesn't work anymore at all.  But he's trying to, he's trying to alter that.  It's the same thing.  He's trying to word it in a way that's a little more clever.  And, oh my God, such transparent.  Right, Roland, Roland.  I saw your clever ruse in last night's email.  You're going to have to think of some new tricks, Roland.  I know.  Because you're starting to see through these things. 
[00:19:00]  Name and what they're from.  That's all we need.  Maybe a picture, so I can know who the fuck some of these people are.  I see a name, I'm like, I gotta look them up on IMDB.  And then I'm like, oh, okay, that guy.  No.  Or like you could say, like Roland could say, hot, blonde, white, blue eyes.  Yeah, like a description in a crime or something like that.  Right.  That's all I want.  That's it.  Unless they're black, then you gotta actually put in that they're black.  That's what they do when they describe a crime. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, it always comes back to racism with me.  I'm such a racist.  Well, I'm going to put that, I'm going to start making you separate one sheets.  It'll say, like, Shaquille O'Neal, 8.30 a.m., in studio, Dove Soap, black.  Right.  Yeah, that would be perfect.  Okay, good.  Oh, my God.  I'm four lanes over that I've got to get through to go to the Midtown Tunnel.  Out of my way.  How's it going to work?  And now I've got to cut all the way over through traffic.  You're not going to just wait patiently and let people pass you?  No.  It's a game. 
[00:20:00]  It's a game, and I must win.  And winning in the game of driving in the city means not letting anyone through.  You'll lose points.  Yeah.  Would you like some more soap products?  They're going to send some.  Well, hold on.  Oh, there we go.  All right.  Now, this is good, because I'm at the light.  So now I can just blow past everybody once it turns green like a top-fueled dragster.  You do like to win.  I think that's what your problem with the Shorty Awards was last night.  Well, I do like to win, and I didn't win that. 
[00:20:30]  And it was a little disappointing, but in retrospect, it was stupid.  I was a rube trying to actually win this.  I can't believe that radio wasn't a real category.  Some of the bullshit categories that they had in radio wasn't a legit category somehow.  Can you believe that?  Social fitness was a category.  What's social fitness?  Social fitness?  Yeah.  I don't even know what that is.  No.  Social media manager, hashtag life-saving hero. 
[00:21:00]  These are categories?  It was all bullshit.  It was all bullshit.  All bullshit.  Oh, there are cops all over the place, and I'm on this goddamn phone.  You don't have, like, the speakerphone or the...  No, I hold it up to my ear.  I don't take calls.  The only call I make is to your dumbass fucking show.  I like that.  I guess you were listening by mistake again?  Yeah, my radio got stuck on the station, and yeah, you're honest.  All right, I gotta go. 
[00:21:30]  I gotta go past this cop.  All right, good luck.  Bye.  Godspeed.  Anthony.  I don't know why...  And this is...  He told you.  Not really.  I mean, I think all he told me was less information is what's needed on these one sheets.  Does that make it...  But he sees through your...  I was being rude.  I said, hey.  Well, you said, take this person on this show, and then you said...  No, I think he's coming in regardless, so that's why it wasn't...  I think it's... 
[00:22:00]  And they...  But if you look back at the names who've been coming in...  We have had good guests on the show.  A-listers.  Farrell.  Hello?  Will Farrell was on the show.  Shaquille O'Neal was on the show.  Sutherland.  Hello?  Donald Sutherland was on the show.  Eugene Levy's coming on, so...  All right, all right.  Let's...  I'm just saying that...  Let's not get crazy and call Eugene Levy an A-lister.  Don Cheadle.  Don Cheadle was on the show.  That would work more to your point than Eugene Levy.  Eh, still, tomato.  No, no.  I would say tomato, broccoli. 
[00:22:30]  That's where you're at right now.  But Eugene Levy is hilarious in the American Pie movies.  That's what he's coming in to promote?  Yeah.  Is the rest of the cast going to come in?  Uh, that's what they're deciding...  They send half to L.A., half to New York.  So we're trying to see which half is coming to New York.  What are the odds that, uh, Tara Reid's going to come in here?  It may happen.  Oh, my God.  That would be the greatest thing ever.  Because it may happen for your after show because of the timing.  Really?  Yeah.  This after show will become Tara Dice? 
[00:23:00]  Tara Dice, my friend.  Tara Dice.  Uh, Scott in New Jersey.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  What's up?  How's it going, Scott?  Hey, I just wanted to know, why do you take Anthony's phone call when, uh, he never takes  any of ours?  Well, the thing is, the thing about Anthony is, the reason that he gets to sit in the  studio and has been doing this for so long is because he has a proven track record of  being, uh, very entertaining.  Now, Scott, I don't want you to take this personally, but there's just most of you that 
[00:23:30]  call in do not have the same track record.  I guess I can agree with that one.  You know what I mean?  Like, Ant's got years of being entertaining on a consistent basis on a, on a, on a huge  show.  Whereas most of the listeners, let's be honest, not you, Scott, necessarily, but most of the  listeners just do rehashed Ant and Jim jokes.  Yeah, I got, I got to give you that.  So, you know what I'm saying?  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Scott. 
[00:24:00]  I still think Anthony should take more phone calls, though, if he's going to call your show.  You think, pay it forward, you're saying?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Well, also, his name's on the wall, and without Anthony, there is no after Opie and Anthony,  so he's kind of got a little bit of carte blanche around here.  Yeah.  All right.  Give me that, too.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Yeah.  That's why Anthony doesn't take calls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scott was excited.  Not everybody gets to do something fun like this on the radio.  Scott just proved everybody's point.  So, you got Gerard Butler. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  In the Celebrity Friends Club.  Yeah.  I got Johnny Fairplay and Justin Stengel from David Letterman.  And Joey Abs from WWE.  Not as strong a list.  I mean, I would put Justin Stengel up there against Gerard Butler.  I don't know if everybody else would, though.  Eric, you're a networker.  You love schmoozing.  You love to schmooze.  Don't you?  I try.  You do.  Do you actually enjoy the art of schmoozing? 
[00:25:00]  It depends on the situation.  What situation?  Because I hate schmoozing.  I'm terrible at it.  And schmoozing when you have to cover and try to repair something that maybe happened  on the show or that something was said.  No, I mean, like.  That kind of stuff.  I mean, like, when you.  Then there's the good kind, too.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I should have let you finish.  So, I'm saying, like, when you go to an event and you know it's a networking opportunity  and you're meeting people from the industry or there's celebrities there or whatever,  you like that schmoozing? 
[00:25:30]  It's.  Yes and no.  You have to do it.  But do you like it?  Do you like it as an activity?  Because some people.  Some.  To an extent, I do.  Yeah.  Because there are people.  And that's like.  There are a lot of people.  It's tiresome sometimes.  There are a lot of people who really enjoy it.  Like, Roland.  It's an exercise.  There's a lot of schmoozing that goes on for you.  Yeah.  It's an exercise.  I mean, people think it's easy, but throw them in a room with celebrities and let them  talk.  It'll be like, uh.  Yeah, because people don't have to be entertaining.  Most people come off as douchebags in front of celebrities.  Yeah.  Or they just freeze. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  And a celebrity has a schmooze meter.  So, they know when they're being schmoozed.  You only have a small window, less than 30 seconds.  Do you like the art of schmoozing?  Yeah.  They teach it to you.  And you take pride in it?  My mentor taught it to me.  Yeah.  Who is your mentor?  I don't mention his name.  I like that.  I like that.  Um, but he taught me everything.  Most, most everything, but he taught me how to do that.  It's something that you take pride in?  I used to be quiet, and he threw me to parties.  He goes, come back and talk to these people.  He goes, that's your job.  That's going to be your job. 
[00:26:30]  Roland's has a different, way different schmoozing technique.  Because Roland knows his advantages that, uh, he's got a very, I'll call it a distinct  look and a crazy ass voice.  And so, what you do is, you just say terribly inappropriate things.  That's correct.  But then you do the high-pitched giggle afterwards, and everybody says, oh, it's okay, it's just  Roland.  Yeah.  And that's your technique.  And then people remember you and like you.  Like, one woman was trying, and trying to find celebrities.  Yeah.  And I said, hey guys, I'm going to take a big shit once she's done yapping. 
[00:27:00]  I'll be back to tell you a joke.  And they're like, ah!  Everybody likes it.  And it just killed her.  She's like, but, huh?  And they go, hey, your time's up.  Time to move on.  Cheeky.  And she can't be mad at you, because everybody around her is going, that's Roland!  That's just Roland!  And she got so pissed, because nobody paid attention to her the whole time.  That's a true story?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  You have to slam, you have to, you have to look at a group and go, that guy is my target.  And you can tell when they're nervous. 
[00:27:30]  And you just do what the guys do.  You just like, shoot them down.  Prison rules.  Prison rules.  You look for the weakest prag, and you go for them.  You go for the jugular.  Right off the bat.  Right off the bat.  Eric, you schmooze.  Yeah.  Is this, do you have fun schmoozing?  I do, to an extent, yes.  Because, like, I am a terrible conversationalist.  I am terrible at remembering not to give one-word answers.  I'm terrible, I'm an awful schmoozer, and I hate the whole thing of it. 
[00:28:00]  I hate every bit of it.  It's not my strong suit.  If you continue doing what you do currently, or even go to the next stage, you desperately  need to learn how to deal with that.  It's mostly the people that aren't in front of the camera or on a microphone.  It's all the behind-the-scenes people that you have to befriend.  Well, listen, I'm going to need to carry you with me, then.  All right.  Because you're going to be my schmoozing guy, and you're going to be like, oh, I got this  guy.  Here's Sam.  He does this and that.  And they'll go, oh, hey, guys.  Were you talking about me?  And then that's what I need. 
[00:28:30]  There's one person I call the king of faux pas.  Who's that?  Yes.  Steve C. was not good?  No.  I mean, I love him to death.  Let's just say cyber-stalking is not schmoozing.  Our old executive producer, Steve C.  Or when he does something, he'll say something.  Sometimes you tell celebrities or their people, make a joke like, hey, that movie sucked balls.  But in your head, you have to know the roster from top to bottom, left to right.  You got to know all the players. 
[00:29:00]  He didn't sometimes.  He didn't always know who was on the field.  He's like, yeah, do you have this actor?  They're like, yeah.  And they actually, because that's their client.  That was the worst movie I've ever seen.  And they're like, well, why?  In my head, I'm like, oh, no.  Don't.  But then I just step back.  Well, why?  You let it happen.  Oh, yeah.  And then they go, yeah, that's my client.  And then you're like, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Because you value the game.  And so when somebody's not playing the game well, you're not there to help them out.  You're not a coach.  You're a player.  I'm there when they seem to put my foot all the way down their head. 
[00:29:30]  That's part of the game, isn't it?  Until they start choking, and I lean a little bit forward heavily, and then they go away.  Roland loved this.  He would just sit there and just watch this crash and burn.  Because we've heard when JWoww was in here last time from the Jersey Shore,  she said she had to change her number.  She said it a couple times.  Because Steve C kept calling her.  Kept texting her.  Yeah.  Well, there was one other Jersey Shore person, too.  Who?  Situation.  Before he was, you know, when the show first started, he was the first number that we got. 
[00:30:00]  Somebody called in and was friends with him, gave us his number.  And from him, we got the other phone numbers for the rest of the cast members.  JWoww did change her number because Steve kept calling her.  But then we found out the situation did as well because Steve couldn't get in touch with him anymore either.  And, by the way, CokeLogic just chimed in on the feedback thing.  I have Sam Roberts' phone number.  What level of celebrity is that?  That's pretty massive, dude. 
[00:30:30]  I know.  Feedback still works.  That's pretty big.  Yeah, it's not supposed to, but it still does.  Nice.  Eric?  Yeah?  Who is your biggest celebrity friend?  Celebrity friend?  Big Kev.  Is it Big Kev?  No.  I don't know if I have any.  You don't have not one.  You don't have one person who anyone would consider a celebrity that you'd text with.  I say that.  In order to be a celebrity friend, you have to be texting with them.  Yeah, I don't text.  He texts on handy. 
[00:31:00]  No, no, Roland.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to correct you on that.  Because...  No, you're both right on this situation.  Okay, okay.  I'm going to say this.  And I don't need Eric...  We've said this before.  But let me get to the end.  Okay.  Eric...  And Travis can back me up on this one because Travis was always there for these stories.  I was there too.  You were there.  Whenever we had Sean Hannity on the show, it was Eric sending emails. 
[00:31:30]  And Eric told us behind the scenes, I'll take care of the Sean Hannity thing.  Don't worry.  I used to intern with him.  We're boys.  I didn't intern with him.  That's what you said.  I never interned with him.  Well, you said that before.  You said, we're cool.  I'll take care of it.  Roland, can we get Sean Hannity on?  Eric would chime in.  Don't worry.  He knows me.  So I'll take care of it.  And he was going on.  Okay.  But he always came on, right?  So we all thought that E-Rock and Sean Hannity had this great relationship. 
[00:32:00]  Or at least a professional relationship, right?  We went to Imus' hard rock event.  And Opie and Anthony were being interviewed by Imus, as was Sean Hannity, right?  So me and Eric were there.  And when I told Travis this story, Eric, he got such a kick out of it.  Of course he did.  I was there behind you.  You were there.  Yeah, behind you.  Okay.  I sit down and we meet Sean Hannity.  And, you know, we shake his hand.  Hey, we're from O&A, blah, blah, blah.  And then Sean Hannity goes, and which one of you is the guys who e-mails me all the time? 
[00:32:30]  I go, oh, no.  And Eric goes, that would be me.  And he goes.  He said my name, but he just didn't know which one of you was.  Is it Eric?  No, see, that's a lie.  Yes, he did.  He didn't know.  That's a lie.  That part didn't happen.  Is it Eric?  No, he said which one of you is Eric.  No, he said which.  Which is when you started giggling like an asshole.  He said which one of you is the guys who always e-mails me, is what he said first.  That's when I started giggling like an asshole.  Because that's way funnier. 
[00:33:00]  That he just knew you as the guy who always e-mails him from O&A.  What happened with that?  I don't, look, the guy's an important dude.  I've met him a few times, but he just didn't remember.  He didn't?  No.  Do you think that you made it seem like you had a bigger relationship with him than you did?  No, I said I could contact him.  Because when anybody else would contact him, they'd never hear from him.  Well, the rest of us had this weird idea that you really, like, you called him and stuff.  I'm not his best friend or anything.  No.  You don't, so you don't have any celebrities that you text with or anything? 
[00:33:30]  On any celebrity level?  It's all behind the scenes people.  Who's the biggest behind the scenes person?  I shouted out Justin Stengel.  He's a behind the scenes person, but I count him as a celebrity because he's huge on Twitter.  He hits me up on Twitter once in a while, but not to the extent that you guys talk to and he calls into your show and whatnot.  You gotta be texting buddies.  Yeah, I'm not texting buddies with him.  Louis C.K.  I have Bob Kelly and Voss.  Oh, that's awful.  That's unfortunate. 
[00:34:00]  I'm sorry, but...  Well, I thought you were a great schmoozer, but I know behind the scenes people.  I don't deal with the main...  Andrew Bates, too.  He texts, so...  You gotta know some on-air people, right, Roland?  Maybe, like, some radio guys.  You gotta know some of the on-air people.  Like Scott and Todd.  Open gym don't count.  No, I guess not.  Do you know Scott and Todd?  Or Elvis Duran.  Or...  Oh, Elvis Duran?  He knows me, but I don't know if I went over there, he would remember looking at me and  saying, oh, that's Eric.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy Fallon.  His staff does, but I don't think he would. 
[00:34:30]  That's yours, not Eric's.  Jimmy Fallon?  Yeah.  Eric, you gotta work on your celebrity rollerbacks.  I don't know if I really need to be in touch with celebrities like that.  Why?  It'd be fun.  It'd be fun, but I don't know if that would be important to any kind of future career outside  of this.  Sure it would.  But celebrities have the most power in the world.  And you could be like...  Oh, Dan Cookie texts me too.  You could look at your wife and be like, hey, look who's texting me.  And she'd be like, oh, I'm so wet right now.  You know?  She doesn't give a shit about any of this. 
[00:35:00]  She doesn't care.  No.  Well, if celebrity relationships weren't important, Roland wouldn't have them.  If true blood...  But Roland should have them.  That's the thing.  That's what he...  He's been around it since he was a little kid.  You know, it's very rare what Roland has and the access that he has to people.  I guess.  L.A.  It was...  You're saying it was L.A. when you made it?  Of course.  I mean, camp and all the things you go to.  He was going out on...  What's camp?  Like, you do, like, entertainment camp and all that in L.A.  Who sends you to entertainment camp? 
[00:35:30]  I don't understand.  Is it like Patrick Ewing's or who...  Oh, no, you go see TV tapings and you hang out on the movie sets and that.  Yeah.  Which Nick used to do basketball camp around here?  What are some of the Knicks?  It wasn't Patrick Ewing.  I have no idea.  I don't follow that.  John Stockton?  Yeah.  John Stockton used to do basketball camp.  Like, that type of thing?  Yeah.  But it's like celebrity camp.  Like, Robert Williams would come out and talk to you and then...  What's the camp?  Dustin Hoffman.  What's the end goal of it?  All...  Everybody you grew up with are now managers, agents, lawyers in the industry. 
[00:36:00]  But when you're kids, you just go to...  They hang out.  It's for your friends.  You're watching TV tapings, movie shows.  Let's go to celebrity camp.  Yeah, I want to go to celebrity camp.  Screw Cleveland.  Let's go to celebrity camp.  It's fun.  Then I went to space camp.  You went to space camp?  Yeah.  Your parents treated you like gold.  Well, actually, my...  Oh, John...  My aunt got me in.  John Starks.  John Starks camp.  That's who it was.  Yeah.  Like, four of us...  You have to have, like, really great grades to get to space camp.  But my parents knew somebody. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  You and your connections.  So me and three other people, we all went because their parents knew somebody.  Yeah.  And when we got there, they all...  All the kids knew that we were the ones that got in by favors.  Mm-hmm.  Because, yes, you have math problems, and we're, like, turning the space shuttle.  Yeah.  And you're supposed to be, like, a math problem.  But you had no idea.  We were like, we...  Did you go on...  Like, it's just a video game.  Wait.  Did you go on that machine...  What is it?  The centrifuge that spins you around?  Yeah, in Kennedy.  Yeah, in Texas.  Oh, wow.  That's where our space camp for, like, three months. 
[00:37:00]  Did you...  Your parents got you in.  Have you ever lived in a world not run by connections and who you know?  No.  So you don't know what it's like to just be one of us?  It's, like, in Disneyland, we went in front of the line.  How?  My buddy's dad was, like, with one of the head of Universal.  Isn't your dad just, like, a chef?  How do you know all these people?  Because he...  You meet him at all the restaurants.  I mean, you own a restaurant in L.A.  All the industry people.  He was an L.A. chef.  And so the industry people went to his restaurant.  Loved his food.  And he starts meeting friends. 
[00:37:30]  And so, like, went to space shuttle landings and all that stuff.  So it's, like...  So, like, Roland's on par with, like, kids of celebrities.  Like, you just show up, you're born, and everything you know is just in that industry,  and you know everybody.  Like, you would know somebody just by going to high school.  Did that make you jealous, Eric?  Because you're, like...  You didn't have connections coming into this.  Did you?  Very little.  I mean...  Like, what kind of connections?  It was all radio stuff.  What kind of connections did you get through your parents?  Through my parents?  Anything?  Yeah, I got into NBC through my parents. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, NBC.  But outside of that, the rest was all whatever I did.  Yeah, because it's totally different...  It's just so funny that you don't know, like...  No, basically, Disneyland, I didn't...  I never knew what waiting in line was until I...  In college, I went with a group of friends, and then we had to wait in line.  I'm like, what's this?  Why would you wait in line for this?  So I texted another buddy, and we got the special passes.  Of course you did, because you always had your buddies.  Yeah, so you're like, hey...  Doesn't it get exhausting to have to maintain these relationships? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, it's just...  It's become second nature.  Once you grow up with it, that's what you know.  Because favors just seem so exhausting to me.  Like, I'll do this for you, but now you owe me a favor.  I got to make sure I don't say the wrong thing to you, because it'll cost me a favor.  It's not exhausting?  No.  It's become...  You're used to it.  It's so long.  Second nature.  But those favors are on the same level as, hey, could you come over and help me move  this couch, or just, you know, something a little small and petty like that.  Favors are like, hey, could you put me in touch with this publicist, or get me this? 
[00:39:00]  It's on that same level in his world.  Like, it's no big deal.  It's like, when I was a kid, I had to do a golf tournament, and I was paired with Jack  Nicholson.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Because it's like a celebrity tournament.  How long did you hang with him for?  Two days.  You hung out with Jack Nicholson for two days?  Do you have a photo?  My mom had this.  I was like 12, because every kid gets paired up with a celebrity.  At what point did you know who he was?  Yeah.  Where did you know him from at 12? 
[00:39:30]  My dad showed me One Floor Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  At 12?  Yeah.  My dad goes, watch this movie.  You had a good film education.  Oh, you did.  That's what you learned.  And you knew him from Batman, probably, too.  More of that one, and another movie I forgot that he was in.  You get paired up with celebrities.  And did he talk to you?  At first, he didn't want me, because he wanted somebody else.  He goes, I don't want this kid.  So then they threw me out and paired me up with, I think it was either Dustin Hoffman or 
[00:40:00]  another person.  I don't remember.  Jesus.  Only Dustin Hoffman.  What celebrity thing was this?  This wasn't exactly Happy Gilmore and Bob Barker.  These are real celebrities.  No, this was a Malibu golf tournament.  Yeah.  And the kids all got paired up.  And you just get them coffee, whatever they need.  Was he cool?  Yeah.  Apparently, the person he got sucked.  And he goes, I want that kid back.  And he kind of ran around like a maniac.  Which is no huge surprise.  And I left him alone.  I never got pictures, autographs. 
[00:40:30]  He offered me.  I'm like, I don't care.  Well, then how did you get a photo with him, then?  Um, my mom was there, and I was walking by him, and she took it.  Can she send it to you?  Oh, yeah.  I'll ask her.  It's in the boxes.  Yeah.  I have pictures of that.  You got, you know, that's just like.  But it's just life.  Yeah.  Like, so, but doesn't it make it so that, like, this stuff isn't even special anymore?  Well, that's what they make it.  So when you come in the industry, you're just like, well, whatever.  Oh, I got you, because you've had all the experiences already.  Nothing surprises you.  But I, I just, I can't fathom worrying about favors and things like that. 
[00:41:00]  Because like Eric said about, like, your friend moving your couch, like, that's not something  that you have to, that's going to be held over your head.  Like, that's not something that's going to impact your job or whatever.  No.  But the favors, your favors do.  Yeah, it depends.  You just have to get used to life that way.  Yeah.  Whew.  And Eric.  Yeah.  This is, you, you kind of want to be where Roland's at, right?  Um.  You like that.  I would like to get into that industry of, of doing, uh, publicity and booking and things 
[00:41:30]  like that.  Well, Jason in California has a good question for Roland.  What's up, Jason?  What's up, Sam and guys?  Hey, I'm just wondering that, uh, is Roland a Make-A-Wish child or, uh.  That's a great question.  He's the only kid I see cut line.  Were you, were you a Make-A-Wish kid and you wished, you, I guess it seems like a little overabundance,  but did you wish for, I want to go to Disneyland and cut all the lines and then space camp and  then Hollywood camp and then play golf with Jack Nicholson?  Um.  No, you were not a Make-A-Wish kid. 
[00:42:00]  No.  You swear?  Yeah.  Promise.  Promise.  Cross your heart.  Yeah.  Okay, I believe you.  It was just a typical summer for a kid.  Um.  Yeah.  It doesn't seem typical at all.  Yeah, because, um, when, uh, for, like, my mom came for her birthday, she told me, like,  the backlog, uh, Back to the Future after it was filmed, because I loved the movie so much.  How did she get access to that?  Her friend.  It's your whole life.  It's just generations of favors and friends.  Like, she walked, she walked, so I got a picture of me in Pine Valley and me all over.  Did you ever get molested by a celebrity? 
[00:42:30]  Mmm, no.  I wish.  So, Eric, you want to get into the publicity world?  It's, uh, it's difficult, but yeah.  And talent booking?  Booking, booking's a whole nother, yeah, it's a different piece.  You want to be a publicist?  They do kind of go hand in hand, but they're also two very different things.  That's what you want to be, though, a publicist?  I don't know.  I, I took, uh, a lot of PR stuff while I was in college, and.  But doesn't it seem exhausting to make sure that you're saying the right things to the  right people all the time? 
[00:43:00]  Like, that's your whole job?  That's what, that's what it is.  It's just constantly spinning plates and, uh.  That's what I'm saying.  I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to do that at all.  That's why I'm trying to get away from behind the scenes as much as possible.  It's so much harder.  I know it's so much harder, but it's also, you know, it depends on what your interests  are and, you know, what you could be passionate about.  You love schmoozing.  Not a bad thing.  Or, if you're good at it, why, you know, go with your strengths?  Yeah.  Or when people think it's easier, like, let the bomb go off and wait and let people yell 
[00:43:30]  at you, then fix it.  And then.  And then leave happy.  And then talk to me about it.  Yeah.  It's, it's, some people think it's easy, but it's not, it's not easy at times.  It's crazy.  Like, yeah, like, like, hanging out with you, publicity and booking, that's the last industry  I would want to be a part of.  Like, I know you get to meet cool people or whatever, and you get to do cool things.  It's not fun.  It doesn't seem like your life is fun.  To me.  No, I know there's some times where you go to, you're invited to an awesome event, and  then you'll get texts, oh, by the way, just you. 
[00:44:00]  You're like, oh, can I bring somebody?  No.  And you gotta ditch whoever you're with.  Yeah, it's like, one time I got invited to, like, Edward Norton's house, like, hey,  come over, we're gonna hang out, alright, I'm bringing my friend, she's cool.  No.  Just go to Edward Norton's house.  So you're trying to bang a chick, and you're thinking, I'll hang out with her, she'll see  what I'm doing, I got the invite to Edward Norton's house, and then you find out it's  just you.  Now, is that because Edward Norton was wanting you to be by yourself to molest you?  No.  No.  It's just because they know you tell no secrets.  So whoever, like, even Carson, you hang out with him and you're by yourself because it's 
[00:44:30]  like, they could be themselves.  They trust you.  It's like us, we all bust balls, we say things.  Why on earth would they trust you?  Because I don't tell secrets.  You don't?  No.  Unless you need to.  I haven't told any industry secrets, no, I would never.  You don't tell secrets, but like around here, you use secrets as collateral.  I'm over here, though, it's like these secrets are like, eh, whatever.  Yeah.  It's not like Kerr Indian ones or Herc secrets where you're like, hey, did you hear what 
[00:45:00]  happened on the film set?  No, blah, blah, blah.  What?  And that's the end.  Yeah, I know the TMZ secrets.  Speaking of Hollywood and stuff, we found out today that Jet broke up.  You know the band Jet?  Yeah.  They were actually, we had them in studio.  Yeah.  I was thinking we'd play one of their songs while we still have a couple minutes.  Or play Bruce.  Bruce.  Why would I play Bruce?  Because it's awesome.  They were, Jet was in studio in the K-Rock days.  Um, and, I mean, they were fun to hang out with.  They played like three songs or something. 
[00:45:30]  Rack and tours.  I didn't get to go to that.  I was in college.  Plus, they weren't in our studio.  We went to them.  Yeah.  At Sony Studios.  At Jack White.  That was a good show.  I'm sure it was.  And how many?  20 of us?  It's crazy.  15?  20?  Were you with us at that point?  Yeah.  No, not you.  Sam.  I was in college.  Oh, okay.  I had interns.  Because I remember everyone was there, so it would seem odd that you were.  I was back in Syracuse.  I love Jack White.  Like, more than my mom.  But.  Wow. 
[00:46:00]  I couldn't get there.  Did you get tickets for Rosalind?  I've got to talk to you about a favor.  I'll get you in.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But, then I'll owe you a favor.  We'll talk.  We'll talk.  Okay.  Which song are we going to play, Eric?  Wow, I didn't realize they did this many times.  They did like three songs, right?  Yeah.  Let's see.  We have a bunch, actually.  Shine On, Are You Gonna Be My Girl.  Are You Gonna Be My Girl is our big hit.  Skin and Bones.  I like Skin and Bones, though.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  Hold on.  Let me find.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's play Skin and Bones.  This is Jet when they were in studio with the O.B. and Anthony show.  They broke up because of this performance.  You haven't?  Yeah, I know.  I'm kidding.  They didn't break up because of this performance.  This was several years ago.  This is when they were in our K-Rock studio.  They took a long time to break up.  Yeah, I know.  There was a lot of discussions and paperwork and stuff like that.  It's like getting out of a cell phone contract.  It's never easy.  I remember somebody who screwed up the Apple wires when they were performing.  No, I think that was Finger Eleven. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Finger Eleven.  Somebody should have gotten fired for it.  It was so bad.  Remember?  We had Finger Eleven in studio.  No, that was the K-Rock engineer.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And we were sitting in studio for a half an hour just staring at the band and talking  to them about the fact that we couldn't hear the instruments they were playing.  Yeah.  That was embarrassing.  Luckily, Jet did not turn out this way.  This is Jet before they broke up on the O.B. and Anthony show.  Nah, what are you guys going to do now?  This is called Skin and Bones.  Skin and Bones.  Skin and Bones. 
[00:47:30]  Skin and Bones. 
[00:48:00]  Skin and Bones. 
[00:48:30]  Just kept praising on what you've done with your time 
[00:49:00]  Don't feel so bad, I'm used to that  Don't feel so bad, get used to that  Don't push it, baby, please don't go too far  Swear I love you just the way you are  Skin and bones, baby, yes, you are my star 
[00:49:30]  Swear I love you just the way you are  Don't push it, baby 
[00:50:00]  Don't push it, baby  Don't push it, baby  Please don't go too far  Swear I love you just the way you are  Skin and bones, baby, you are my star 
[00:50:30]  Swear I love you just the way you are  Don't push it, baby  Once again, Jet!  Very good.  It's an awesome song.  We should get more bands.  Yeah.  I mean, there aren't that many good rock bands anymore, but if we could get bands like Jet to perform in here and Jack White to come in here.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, that's the only people I like.  Jet's gone now. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, we'll never get Jack White in here, though, will we?  Possibly.  I'll fucking freak out.  Like, that's Rob Zombie level for me.  Would you get his signature on your arm for another tattoo?  Yeah, today.  All right.  Because he did the show before, so that's all that matters right now.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, yeah, if he were here today, I wouldn't even do it for the air.  I would try to get him to sign my arm and tattoo it on, yes.  A hundred percent.  Without.  Would you get, like, Danny, like, guitar and have him?  No, I don't need to sign guitar. 
[00:51:30]  I don't play guitar.  Oh.  But I would try.  No, I would get it on my arm and tattoo.  Like, there's nothing else you need to get signed after that.  It's permanently on your arm forever.  Like, I would do it on my forearm.  I would do it on my, I would do it wherever, you know?  I would do it on my neck.  Well, if the day of your wedding, would you miss your wedding to meet Jack White?  Yeah, I would try.  I would, well, I would try to.  I would really try to do both.  Just text in and I'll get you in trouble.  I would meet Jack White while I was wearing my suit.  And then I would try to show up at the altar just in the nick of time.  I'm here, baby.  I'm here.  I'm here for both.  First, you can tattoo on. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I can handle both.  Don't smear it.  We gotta go.  Or get the tattoo artist to come along.  Well, listen, I wanted to talk about how disgusting Opie's habits are, but we didn't  have time today.  Wiping piss off the seat.  Just lift the seat and you won't have to.  I heard that.  Disgusting, right?  You spray like Lysol.  Something.  Just wipe it off a toilet paper.  I don't know.  It's gross, but.  That means piss is all over the floor.  I was perplexed by Roland's life.  Maybe we'll talk about that a little bit tomorrow.  Depending on what goes on on the show, it's very unpredictable.  Stay tuned.  Pauly D. from the Jersey Shore will be on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow. 
[00:52:30]  We'll be back with more of this then.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez coming up next.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
