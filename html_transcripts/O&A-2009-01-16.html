<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion surrounding the Miracle on the Hudson, the emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549. Opie and Anthony debated whether the event was a "miracle" or a "crash," with Anthony leaning towards the latter, emphasizing the calm conditions and Sully Sullenberger's skill, while Opie highlighted the successful, fatality-free landing.  The conversation included numerous listener calls, air traffic control audio, in-plane audio, and satirical commentary on Governor David Paterson's speech and Larry King's interview style.  The segment was filled with off-color jokes about the pilot, the geese, and the passengers, and speculation about Sully's personal life and laptop contents.  Andrew Dice Clay was referenced, compared to Charles Nelson Riley. A Family Guy clip satirizing media coverage was played, along with an attempted humorous song about the event created by a staff member, Tim.  The hosts also played a short soundbite of Governor David Paterson's reaction, contrasted with a hypothetical Robert De Niro response.

The show continued with a comedic segment centered on listener-submitted definitions of a "crash," ranging from absurd scenarios to the pilot becoming an American hero.  Various humorous caller contributions were featured, including a baseball analogy and the headline, "What's bad for the geese is good for the lander."  This led into a planned bit involving recurring segment personality, Patty, and a large amount of listener-submitted change. The hosts, along with Jimmy Norton, brainstormed increasingly outlandish and humiliating ideas for this bit, involving honey, peanut butter, maple syrup, a horse mask, roaches, and even having Patty collect the change from a homeless person or the audience. Patty expressed apprehension. The segment also included mention of upcoming events and a planned music marathon related to the plane landing.

The next segment marked a return to the show's usual "foul language and toilet humor."  Following advertisements for Gamefly and Affliction M1 Global (with guest Jimmy discussing the Fedor Emelianenko fight), the hosts revisited the Patty bit, initially proposing an absurdly dangerous and inappropriate plan involving a firecracker. This was scrapped, and the focus shifted to Patty, who was in studio wearing a horse mask.  The hosts aggressively and insultingly questioned her financial situation and living conditions relating to her Section 8 housing.  They mocked her struggles to collect scattered change, her lack of employment despite a college degree, and her personal hygiene and health. Guest Danny joined the conversation, discussing unrelated topics.  The show also featured a clip from *Quincy, M.E.*, which was criticized, followed by a caller prank on a public access Jesus show. The segment ended with more ribbing of Patty and a final DirecTV advertisement, along with sexually explicit remarks from Patty.

A subsequent segment began with anti-Semitic tropes and jokes before transitioning to a critique of a *Quincy* episode, featuring profanity and sexually explicit descriptions of how they'd improve the scene.  This shifted to a discussion of the hosts' and callers' childhood summer camp experiences, often involving abusive counselors, bullying, and racial tensions.  Personal anecdotes about anxieties and insecurities surrounding girls were shared.  One caller, Scott, recounted a brutal experience involving being tied to a tree and beaten. The segment concluded with a listener call and an extended, graphic audio clip from a pornographic film, analyzed with offensive commentary by the hosts and guest Finger 11 (who experienced microphone issues).

The final segment involved the hosts graphically describing a sexually explicit encounter using highly vulgar language and mimicking a demanding, aggressive female voice ("Angry Vince").  The segment ended abruptly with the hosts announcing the end of their show and promoting Ron and Fez.

[00:03:30]  he's a hero today  sully  sully  sully rules  can i come in i'm ready to discuss it with an a little bit before you come on the air he's like  let me tell you  i was what were you saying  i want you to repeat what you were saying  well i gotta set it up a little bit because uh  i watched all the coverage  yeah  i mean i watched coverage  up the yin yang as they say  and um 
[00:04:00]  uh  everybody was just like wow  this is a miracle amazing  that this pilot  was able to do this  and  and uh  it's a miracle  uh  and i'm not gonna  i'm not downplaying what the pilot did  because he did  he brought that thing in  it was amazing  he had to go with that left turn  drastic left turn and go  we're going river  and  we're landing in the river  he had  no  zero wind  nice 
[00:04:30]  no wind  all right  completely calm river  there wasn't a white cap  or a ripple  to be found on the river  yesterday  it's completely flat  and he had the widest  longest runway  in the world  the hudson river  yeah  you gotta think quick  which he did  very experienced pilot  you really are  the guy did a great job  but  you're a buzz kill  if there was any wind  yesterday  or any uh  waves or white caps 
[00:05:00]  on that river  that friggin thing  would have  cartwheeled  you know what  sully would have  figured it out  sully is amazing  i'm saying look  sully is amazing  but  with a water landing  especially with  with uh  an end  your engines like that  the  the engines hit first  yeah  that's why they always  whenever you see a water landing  you see that 767  that was hijacked  that hit the water  but it was an ocean  that it went down  and so a lot of waves  uh  he came in  and he had a wing 
[00:05:30]  dip down  because of uh  uh  the wind  and  and a wave  hit the one engine  and it spins the plane around  and breaks up  into a thousand pieces  you're hitting it like  170 miles an hour  he was able to bring it in  and  pretty much put both  the engines in the water  at the same time  he had to stay calm  to do that my friend  no he didn't  hell yeah  he landed like  he was landing on a runway  the guy had a glide slope  that could have gone down  to the verrazano bridge  the guy  he had  he touched down 
[00:06:00]  to like 48th street  he could have gone down  to the battery  I love Sully  Sully landed a plane  I will fight both of you today  Sully landed a plane  in the water  what makes you feel  warm and fuzzy inside  if this doesn't  this is a nice story  for everybody  I'm not downplaying that  I'm not  all I'm saying is  they said this is the  this hasn't happened  in 45 years  where there's been  a water landing  and everybody surviving  amazing  especially when you have  18,000 ferries 
[00:06:30]  converging on it  in a second  maybe Sully figured  that out too  he's like you know what  Sully didn't figure that out  Sully looked and said  I gotta land here  Sully made a great decision  that's what Sully did  he made a great decision  don't try to hit  Teterboro  which would have been  hysterical to see that  plane just barrel into  Pat from Munaki's trailer  at the end of the runway  because that thing  wasn't going to land  at Teterboro  without overshooting it  and figuring  he wasn't going to make  Newark either  so he makes the turn  a drastic left turn 
[00:07:00]  he's got about  3,500 feet  when the engines  quit on him  yeah  he makes the turn  and does what  a pilot does  lands the goddamn plane  he did a great job  I'm saying he did  a fantastic job  I'm not  I'm not downplaying it  well they gotta say  it's a water landing  first of all  it was a water landing  the media is calling  this kind of a crash  but it really was  a water landing  it's a crash  if you take off  and both your engines  blow  and you're in the  Hudson River  two minutes later 
[00:07:30]  you're crashed  it's an unscheduled  what is it  it's an unscheduled  landing  no  it crashed  please  I thought you'd  come in  kind of like  wow that was so cool  look at that  look at that  ladies and gentlemen  we're going to sit here  in the Hudson for a while  there seems to be a ship  in our pier  once that pulls out  we'll be able to taxi  into the pier  yeah  yeah wow  and I gotta say  look  I understand that  I know that you're 
[00:08:00]  probably a little tired  of hearing about Sully  to have both engines blow  yeah  and to be  as close as this guy was  to Newark  and to LaGuardia  and for his plane  to be in such bad shape  he couldn't hit either  to navigate  between Manhattan  and not make a bad  that was amazing  it was amazing  he was over  the river  well  he had to get over  the river  that's some split second  decision making  he couldn't make Newark airport  that is literally  yeah  you could throw a rocket 
[00:08:30]  at Newark airport  he couldn't make Newark  it was a great decision  because he would have  had to go over  some real estate  and you know how crazy  that is to go  wow  I'm going to like  take a little drastic left  and I'm going to land  this in the river  the guy was  it's not a good day  to land in the river  it's nippy  he's got to be assuming  that a lot of my  passengers are going to  die from something  it was what  less than 20 degrees  yesterday  the water  some people say in 40  but I heard it was like  just over 32  33 degrees  he was able to  to 
[00:09:00]  to  he had a lot of room  he wasn't  dropping  he didn't have  a short runway  he was able to bring it in  very shallow  that's why the thing  didn't break up at all  also had a plane  full of fuel  was able to dump fuel  that's heavy  he was way too heavy  to land  and he's hitting the water  it's like concrete  the wheel  and they said  they hit the water  going about 125 miles an hour  everybody hit their head  the fuel helped  the  actually helped  the plane  stay buoyant 
[00:09:30]  why are you such a buzzkill?  it did  come on  the fuel helped  the plane  join the happy side today  but the fact that  it didn't break up  this is a very good story  exactly  but I'm just saying  come on  his name's  Chesley Beast  Sully Sullenberger  the third  when I saw his face  I went  thank god  that's the pilot  I want to see  when I get into a plane  I kind of understand  what you're saying  but he  didn't panic  he wasn't a panicky Pete  yeah yeah yeah 
[00:10:00]  and thank god  thank god  he wasn't a panicky Pete  because a lot of  the faithful listeners  were trying to figure this out  and you were  absolutely correct  this freaking  water landing  crash into the Hudson River  literally  happened outside  my apartment  and Jimmy's apartment  we live  right next to each other  I hate to bust your bubble  Opie  a million people  saw that thing  land in the river  well that's great  I was right there  it's  what are you jealous 
[00:10:30]  because I saw  stupid  jealous  it's the west side  of Manhattan  you and ate that  it's like saying  I saw the world trade center  you're not even impressed  you're not even impressed  with that  you got a window  that overlooks the river  what do you think  your little house  on the prairie  great  I was one of the lucky ones  that I didn't get to see  myself  but my girl  so it's hearsay  no my girl saw it  and a bunch of people  from Philly  saw it  from Philly  that's impossible  what kind of telescopes  were they using  and they were panicky Pete  and they could have got  this on video 
[00:11:00]  but they couldn't figure out  how to work  my stupid video camera  and then after  the whole thing  was over  they're like  one of the guys  from Philly  goes  oh my god  my phone takes video  and it was right  in my pocket  choked  that's what people  think though  you don't panic  when you're seeing  a plane come in  what would you do  pull out your flip phone  in a second  or pull out the flip cam  boom on  why are you so angry today  this is a great story  I'm not angry  I'm just laughing at you  why I think  dude 
[00:11:30]  from my apartment  look  look at the west side  of Manhattan  how many windows  are there  alright  well how many people  live in Manhattan  look at the  Henry Hudson Parkway  I bet you  there was less than  a thousand people  that actually saw  this thing  are you kidding me  saw this thing land  in the water  I bet a million people  because most people  weren't looking that way  I bet a million people  saw it  hell no  the Jersey side  hell no  not everyone's  at their window  at that time  a lot of people  are working  and elsewhere  trust me  I bet a million  people saw that  alright then why  don't we have video  of it crashing yet  because everyone's stupid 
[00:12:00]  alright  if a million people  saw it  not one person  has a video camera  a video of this  I saw a video  from the Henry Hudson  somebody actually got  it didn't get it  going in the water  but it got it  very low  coming in  right  really  over the GWB  yeah  why didn't they  get it in the water  why didn't they  turn it off  this isn't interesting  trees in the way  he was going the  other way  up to Henry Hudson  and somebody was  taping it  I bet in time  there will be  video of it  we'll see  maybe they're  negotiating right now  yeah  somebody's negotiating 
[00:12:30]  when this  when this went down  the plane was  20 feet over the water  by the way  the first person  I thought of  was Opie  when I found out  where this was  because I know  where his apartment is  we have the buildings  next to us  but you know  sometimes  one of the people  on the show  lives a lot higher  than the other one does  and sees the river  and I thought  my apartment  faces the river  this thing  20 blocks away  not even  it was like 15 blocks away  in the end  and my girl  was actually  on the phone  with 911  going  this thing's crashing  she was actually 
[00:13:00]  on 911  before it hit the water  and then she's  she's screaming girl  and I'm like  she's going to be  on TV  she's going to be  the 911 call  they all play  and she doesn't want  any of that  type of attention  whatsoever  but she would  literally was on  when the plane hit  going oh my god  screaming  you know  being that person  so  then we had  detectives call  because she called  911  then we had  the media call  in our house  because I guess  they work together  you want to go  on CNN  it was the whole  thing going on  no she ain't  going to do  any of that  that's anonymous  I would have 
[00:13:30]  she doesn't want  to do any  of that stuff  CNN  no they were  too busy  with that  one chubby guy  80,000 times  the same story  yeah well I was  just trying  to nod off  when all of a sudden  alright shut up  chubby guy  heard his story  8,000 times  watching the news  that's alright there  yeah  no  but then just  then I ran home  and just  watching that plane  in the water  like that  I was like  what the  half  all standing  on the wings  like  my feeties 
[00:14:00]  are getting  chilly  yeah  and then  Sully  just  confident  he just  walks through  the plane  twice  before he  leaves  last guy  to leave  the plane  how come  I'm looking  on eBay  and I see  this guy  named Sully  selling 500  laptops  I know  a bunch  of wet  sea cushions  with logs  on them  Sully's got  jewelry for sale  all kinds  of goodies  DVD players  rumor has it  one lady  refused to leave  the plane  until she got  her luggage  these type  of stories 
[00:14:30]  are coming  out now  oh yeah  yeah right  what'd she have  a laptop  I don't know  probably her  carry on  she's like  I ain't leaving  until you get my  carry on  this guy said  he had to  basically shove  her down the  aisle  because she  was grabbing  her luggage  and she was  screaming  go get my  purse  he actually  went back  and got her  in the mouth  we've talked  about this  when the last  plane incident  happened  and those  are the people  that are going  to end up  killing you  the ones  that refuse  to do the  right thing  and want to  wait for  somebody else  that happens  to be on  the plane  with them  you just  gotta go 
[00:15:00]  and hope  for the  best  for everybody  isn't that  two in a row  no fatalities  yeah  wow  oh that third  one's going  to be a charm  what's going  to happen  five planes  are going  to collide  at 35,000  feet  and blow up  and land  on a school  gathering  oh or we do  oh Jiminy Cricket  my old  my old college  roommate's in town  so we went to  dinner last night  and he has to  fly out today  and he's freaking  out and then  there was someone  else in my apartment  and they had to 
[00:15:30]  fly today as well  and they're freaking  out I'm like  are you kidding  me today is  the best day  to fly  ever  the day after  one of these  incidents  trust me  it's perfect  nothing's going  to happen  the odds of  two of these  happening  in two days  you can't even  you can't even  do that math  miracle followed  by tragedy  today  what  now that I  said that  right  what  do you know  I realized  I didn't know  there was a  I had no idea  this happened  because at the  time  let's just say 
[00:16:00]  I was engaging  in something  I was engaging  in something  that men do  in prison  except I was  doing it  with a girl  and it was  fun  I actually  read that  on one of  the message  boards  what  because people  were wondering  if you were  okay  they know  you fly a lot  and all that  and you  you actually  sent out a  little message  that I'm fine  I was  why would I  they went up  in the water  flying into the  river  exactly  the police  there's too many  there's too many  connecting flights  who wants to go  from LaGuardia  to 48th street  that's just  silly  which incidentally  that was actually  faster if you  know New York 
[00:16:30]  than driving down  the west side  highway at that  hour  it's more  efficient  I did send out  a say now  but I totally  forgot about that  the phones are  lit  do you all  know about this  a little bit  a little bit  we're gonna  take a quick  break  go right  to the phones  we got  we got  Governor Patterson  just screwing up  his line  his big line  maybe we could  get  he should have  practiced it  a little  Mr. Faber-Sham  what was the line  oh you gotta hear it  it's fantastic  yeah well  I mean just to  help Jim 
[00:17:00]  it was like  apparently the  mouth bones  connected to the  eye bone  on the old  governor  we should just  set this up  to just mess  with his head  governor there  was no plane  incident you  silly goose  and I think  Bloomberg was  charging the  passengers a  rescue tax  and then actually  charged them for  the ferry ride  back  probably  and Patterson  is standing  there on the  east river  saying where  is all the  where are the  people  where's the  hoopla  where is it  no but he 
[00:17:30]  said something  like well we  once had a  miracle on  34th street  now we have  a miracle  Hudson  he just blew  the line  oh it's one  big history  line and oh  he just blew  it  that's one thing  we want to do  today  there's more  there's more  examples of  people blowing  their big line  there was one  recently where  there was a  perfect oh the  OJ Simpson  the big OJ  Simpson  guilty thing 
[00:18:00]  a big historic  thing whenever  they play the  tape you got to  hear her  stammering  stammering  through  Orenthal  I think there's  a few others  out there too  maybe we can  play some of  those because  man the  gov he  blew it  actually all  12 of those  juries blew  their big line  when they  said not  and Larry  King  I watched  Larry King  Anthony brings  the hypothermia  discussion with  Larry King to  the table today  so in stunned  delight I watched  this dolt 
[00:18:30]  ask the most  inane questions  of his group  of professionals  this is our  exclusive coverage  of Miracle on  the Hudson  with the Opie  and Anthony  show  that's right  no one else  is doing this  today we're the  only show  so stay right  here Opie and  Anthony  good for you  you picked the  place to listen  today man  this is exclusive  coverage  of Miracle on  the Hudson  no one else  is actually  even covering  this at all  hell no  this is what 
[00:19:00]  you do with  something like  this  what  yes  Steven S  from Bayshore  if Sully  was a real  hero the  geese would  have survived  as well  what about  the geese  what happened  to the geese  you know  nobody's  bringing up  the fact  that a lot  of geese  died  I bet  Peter's  like protesting  Sully  I want to  know how  many geese  he took  out  thanks Canada  again  stupid  Canadians  sending their  god damn  big stupid  dumb birds  down 
[00:19:30]  yeah at this  point Canada  just stay out  of our way  please  keep your  geese  up there  you're messing  with everything  they're a little  chilly  they fly down  here into our  engines  enough with your  stupid geese  they were probably  stoned  Canadians  you pot smoking  how many geese  do you think  Sully took out  to take out  two engines  because you were  telling me  to test the  engines  they do  the frozen  turkey  thing  they fire  frozen  turkeys  into engines  to test  out  to make 
[00:20:00]  sure  that they  actually  work  in a bird  strike  to see  if they  can survive  a bird  strike  they fire  they have  a thing  that fires  frozen  turkeys  into jet  engines  who  builds  that machine  for a living  Ted's  frozen  turkey  shooting  gun  emporium  we shoot  frozen  turkeys  at whatever  objects  you need  them  fire that  Bob  they shoot  them  at the  windshields  too  to make  sure  to see  if the  windshields  can take  a hit  from  big bird  so why  can't we 
[00:20:30]  have those  windshields  why does  a lousy  pedal mess  us up  so people  can fly  through them  dramatically  good point  hey Kevin  from Connecticut  you're going to  get a few  of these lines  today  Sully was  quoted as  saying  see Corey  Lytle  that's how  it's done  let's go to  the phones  they've been  chomping at the  bit  we'll start  with Paul  in Jersey  Paul how  are you  hey there  Paul  good morning  guys  Jimmy  what's up  my man  hey buddy  how are you  good good  listen  what makes  this guy  so amazing 
[00:21:00]  is that  he only had  one chance  it's not like  he was able  to bring it  back up  if he couldn't  get it right  he got one  chance down  everybody was  fine  no injuries  nothing  and the second  thing is  what's more  amazing than  him bringing  it down  out to the  river  is that  everybody  was claiming  to be the  first responded  on 911  no matter  what station  you turned  to everybody  claimed to be  the first  responder  it was amazing  well my  girls in the  running  I'm telling  you  they actually  people started  when they  call 911  they couldn't 
[00:21:30]  take any more  calls  right  they had so  many people  calling  even before  the plane  hit  people just  knew  and started  dialing away  911  I'll bet you  that when  Sully called  the air traffic  people  I bet you  they were  on the  horn  before  the plane  where they  said  we've taken  two gooses  to the  engine  two silly  geese  have caused  a bit of a  to-do  I and my  creepy mustache  we're here at the 
[00:22:00]  site of the  to-do  we're gonna head  into  oh the media  was so repulsive  yesterday  one of the  things  there's no death  for them to  report  this is honestly  what one of the  reporters said  he's on the  phone and he  goes  well were there  any elderly  passengers  that may have  some kind of  a delayed  reaction  heart attack  in the next  couple of  days  you're not  kidding  they were  so upset  that it  wasn't a  complete  disaster  I mean  they liked  the whole  miracle  story is  great  they finally 
[00:22:30]  went with  that  but in  between  the time  that they  the crash  and then  the time  that they  realized  no one  was hurt  they were  just  in a  tizzy  trying to  find out  how many  dismembered  bodies  were going  to come  washing up  onto  Manhattan  and then  they realized  yeah  everybody's  fine  and then  they went  with that  story  but I  heard the  same  thing  injury  I heard  there was  an infant  on board  was the  infant  thrown into  the engine  to kind  of flush  the geese  out  is it 
[00:23:00]  true  they used  the soft  spot  on the  baby's  head  to bash  the geese  away  horrible  people  to bash  horrid  people  let's go  to Dan  in Houston  he wants  to argue  with you  a little  bit  Anthony  go ahead  Dan  he's a  pilot  no need  to argue  with me  I wasn't  saying this  wasn't amazing  but go ahead  there Dan  no I  would say  I mean  it's not  an easy  thing  like  I'm a  pilot  I was  actually  on this  show  the last  show of the  year  last year  yeah 
[00:23:30]  yeah  yeah  I  remember  you  no I  don't  go ahead  what's  up  landing  an airplane  in the  water  without it  breaking up  is not  an easy  thing to  do  because  you  sort of  gotta  come  down  and  stay  above  the  water  and  bleed  enough  air  speed  off  before  you  actually  get  into  the  water  don't  you  understand  though  as  a  pilot  that  this  was  the  ideal  set  of  circumstances  for a  water  landing  in that  situation  with  the  weather  the 
[00:24:00]  conditions  on the  river  the  width  of  the  river  and  the  fact  that  you  had  a  veteran  pilot  he  really  wasn't  doing  much  different  than  landing  the  plane  on a  runway  except  on the  water  and  he  had  a  very  short  period  of  time  to  make  a  decision  but  it  was  an  ideal  circumstance  for  what  it  had  to  happen  if  there  was  wind  or  white  caps  because  I've  seen  that  river  look  like  the  ocean 
[00:24:30]  on  windy  days  where  one  engine  would  have  hit  before  the  other  one  did  and  spun  that  thing  around  that's  when  it  breaks  up  this  guy  did  a  great  job  I'm  not  downplaying  it  I'm  just  saying  he  did  his  job  without  a  hitch  just  like  a  pilot  lands  his  plane  on  a  runway  every  day  and  they  do  a  great  job  doing  that  he  did  a  great  job  so  you're  not  calling  it  a  miracle  on 
[00:25:00]  the  Hudson  like  the  governor  is  the  miracle  part  of  it  is  the  fact  that  no  one  was  hurt  because  there  is  an  impact  it's  not  as  smooth  as  a  runway  that's  for  sure  you're  stopping  really  quickly  you're  not  rolling  out  that's  for  sure  there's  a  bit  of  hypothermia  yeah  the water's  cold  but  again  New York  City  there's  ferries  all over  the place  the boats  were all  over that  plane  before the  cops  reached  it  well  the  thing  with  that  river  if he  would  have  put  it  down  more 
[00:25:30]  north  those  people  would  have  been  in  deep  trouble  he  hit  the  place  where  the  furries  are  just  rocking  back  and  forth  all  day  long  but  when  you  get  further  north  toward  the  George  Washington  Bridge  there's  none  of that  going  on  they  would  have  been  in  that  water  a lot  longer  a lot  longer  yeah  that's  true  it was  an ideal  situation  if you  get  he  if you're  going to land  in the river  he hit  the perfect  spot to land  in the river  with the  furries  the furries  right there  right next  to the  intrepid 
[00:26:00]  if people  have  checked  that out  when they  come to  New York  City  and that's  another  thing  the guy  did have  a long  glide  slope  and that's  why he  was able  to  not have  this thing  bust apart  on him  if he  came down  hard  that thing  was coming  apart  the thing  came down  very  very  gently  like you  say  bleeding  off  speed  what do  you  the  guy  need  distance  for that  yeah  he had  from  the GWB 
[00:26:30]  to the  Verrazano  that's  a long  runway  I think  Edwards  Air Force  Base  runway  is shorter  than  he had  to avoid  the GWB  he was  about  less than  a thousand  feet  over that  yeah  and dropping  fast  thank you  Dan  this is the  governor  the governor  blew his  line  oh this  is fantastic  his history  making line  sure  this is  something  you want  to say  that gets  replayed  for decades  and it's a  historic thing 
[00:27:00]  when this story  comes up  and he  blew it  all he had to do  was practice  his line  all the way  down  to like  the crash  site  or whatever  the landing  site  and this  is how  it came  out  yesterday  there is  an heroic  pilot  who saved  himself  and approximately  154 other  passengers  this afternoon  we've had a  miracle on  34th street  I believe now  we've had a  miracle in  Hudson  this was  potentially a  very tragic  incident  this pilot  somehow without 
[00:27:30]  any engines  was able to  land this  plane  and  perhaps  without  any serious  injuries  to any  of the  passengers  he screwed  up  and he  goes  40  43rd  miracle  on  where are  we  it's a  miracle  on the  long  island  expressway  yeah  what  miracle  on 42nd  street  I picked  up a  hooker  it actually  was a  woman  let's  say hi  to  Zimmer  in  Jersey 
[00:28:00]  Zimmer  yeah  I was  driving  home  yesterday  listening to  headline  news  and the  guy dropped  the s-bomb  twice  yeah  and then  they have  to apologize  and what's  the media is  so out of  touch  because then  they have  dude  he survived  the plane  crash  they're so  out of touch  exactly what  Ant said  because now  they're apologizing  because a  survivor of  a quote  plane crash  cursed on  the air  I think  we'll all  let it  slide  who's  apologizing  the news  yes  because they're  so out of  touch  what did  the potty mouth  pig say  that's a  that's a  real 
[00:28:30]  moment  you just  you know  what  you just  move on  no one's  going to  complain  because  it's real  language  it's the way  people talk  when they're  crawling from  a plane  in frozen  water  right  and you're  sitting there  apologizing  because the guy  used some salty  language  well he said  the s-word  yeah  I think we can  forgive the guy  I think his feet  are like still  thawing  this is how it  went down though  you were on a  plane  yeah  can you please  repeat what happened  yeah man  we were fine  out  from LaGuardia 
[00:29:00]  to Charlotte  and about  three or four  minutes into the  flight  the left engine  just blew  fire flames  coming out of it  and I was looking  right at it  because I was  sitting right there  and it started  smelling a lot  like gasoline  and a couple  minutes after that  the pilot said  you guys got to  pray for a hard  impact  and that's when  everyone started  to be honest  saying prayers  and looked over  the water  and we thought  we had a chance  because there  was some water  and got to 
[00:29:30]  give it to the  pilot man  he made a hell  of a landing  what was the  landing like  scary  scary as  and then he  dropped the  s-pump  of course  that's funny  but it  describes it  perfectly  how else do you  describe that  right  and then of  course  okay  obviously  it was live  television  and also  a raw  soundbite  so you did  hear some  emotional  words  from a  passenger  who survived  what happened  this afternoon  Jeff from 
[00:30:00]  Norwalk  Connecticut  there you go  well whatever  man  let the guy  curse  Sif thank you  so much  good hustle  to get that  sound in  and yeah  we did have  a little bit  of raw  language  but under  the circumstances  all right  got it  no one's  finding you  we had just  gone through  less than  or just  about  an hour  ago  understandable  passion  shut the  f up  you dope  18 levels  of apologies  and rationalizing  what the guy  just said  we understand  who the hell  is complaining  whoever complains 
[00:30:30]  should be thrown  into a jet engine  yes  uncooked  little butterball  do you think  that a turkey  in his life  when he's  wandering around  like you know  gobbling  whatever those  retard birds  do  because they  are worthless  even if you  don't eat one  for Thanksgiving  you should  kick it  what do you  think the odds  are that he  thinks that  that giant  bird he sees  flying over  he'll someday  be just thrown  into the engine  yeah  what are the odds  that's a little  test  and we're gonna  use you  yeah  you're gonna  be in the 
[00:31:00]  aviation industry  he's all excited  thinking he's gonna  be the first turkey  pilot  he's been spared  yeah  I've been spared  I'm not gonna  be eaten  this is wonderful  wonder if they're  gonna send me  into outer space  and here you  go  oh look  I'm in my  spaceship  they've shoved  me in my  rocket ship  for launch  yeah  right into  the fan blades  I was gonna  say right into  a heavy duty  fan  but you know  at this point  they just  interviewed on  TV the 
[00:31:30]  pilot's neighbor  oh really  why  why are they  interviewing the  pilot's neighbor  what an ass  this guy is  he doesn't cut  his lawn  yeah  he's had our  weed whacker  for two years  Sully's a bum  Sully rules  yeah if you see him  tell him give me  back my rake  but he's not  drinking or having  young Vietnamese  friends over  he's alright I  suppose  let's see what the  neighbor has to say  about Sully  Sully  Sully definitely  rules today  I don't know  yeah he might have  done a good job 
[00:32:00]  but he's a drunk  yeah  real drunk  and a tranny  chaser  of course he  went into the  river  probably saw a guy  in a dress he  liked  got distracted  right  if I was the  mayor of the  city I would be  giving Sully  some you know  I would be  bringing some  women to his  hotel room  wherever the  hell he is  I did by the  way see the  plane  you went last  night  yeah I did  go  because now  it's just  hanging out  in the water  yeah they  kind of  fastened it  to a  down near  Chambers  Chambers  Street  well I  had to  find the  police block  a lot of  the area 
[00:32:30]  off of course  so I had  to park  and we  had to  walk  and it  was like  minus 30  yeah  very cold  and we  got to see  this little  I'm like  where is  it  and the  guy's like  right there  it was like  a piece of  the wing  tip  sticking out  and I'm like  that's the  plane  and the cops  are like  I want to  cross the  street  and that  was the  whole thing  with the  plane  that was it  what are you  going to do  if you get  too close  to the  plane  in the  water  Kenny had  a good  one actually  he was saying  Jimmy was mad  because he  couldn't get  a picture  with the  plane  put his  little arm  around the  wing  I didn't 
[00:33:00]  want to  take a  picture  with me  screw  him  let's  say hi  to Terry  the trucker  Terry  hey guys  how's it  going  pretty good  Terry  I was thinking  about what's  the odds  I'm not  from New York  but how lucky  did he get  there was room  that that thing  wasn't full of  ferries and  boats  to land that  thing in the  middle of the  river  it is the  ferry route  I'm telling you  for all the  people that  commute to  Manhattan  from Jersey  these ferries  just go back  and forth  all day long  they kind of  cross each other 
[00:33:30]  in the middle  of the river  every like  five or ten  minutes  so yeah  I think that  part of it  is a miracle  too that he  didn't hit  any of those  ferries  that's right  this was just  a great landing  it was a miracle  it would have  been a miracle  if he landed  on 7th Avenue  yeah that's a  miracle  yes  wow  alright man  thank you  one of the  one of the  best pictures  was taken  from a telescope  from some  woman  on 57th and  7th  57th and 7th  yeah  that's like 
[00:34:00]  our old  that's our  old joy  so she's on  the 40  something  floor  that must be  40th floor  and she had  a camera hooked  up to a telescope  and got that  picture of them  all standing  out on the wing  but yeah  it's pretty far  in  it's like  midtown  what a park  she is  a camera  on a telescope  I know  that's what  I was  all I was  thinking is  why do they  have a camera  hooked up  to a telescope  all ready  to go  on the 40  something floor  how bad  do you need  a picture  of Saturn  why don't you  tell us  what you're  really doing  with that 
[00:34:30]  telescope  you naughty  naughty lady  dirty girl  aren't you  right next to it  she has a bunch  of rolling pins  and things  of that shape  a lot of people  want to call it  a landing  come on  let's stay  positive today  we saw something  pretty special  yesterday  it was amazing  when you're darting  with a ham sandwich  to get on board  and 15 minutes  later  you're knee deep  in frozen water  you crashed  you crashed 
[00:35:00]  two birds  flew through  the engines  and what are  the odds  birds will fly  into a plane  but both engines  going  and they were  all over the  windshield  and inside  the cabin  I don't know  how the birds  got in there  they said it  was a flock  well it was  probably that  lousy band  flock  a flock  of geese  seagulls  I think  I think God  realized that  you know  we're starting  to lose faith  in them  and he said  alright look  what I could  do for you  gave us a little  peek at his  magic  and now he's  going to go 
[00:35:30]  back to sleeping  you're not giving  sully credit  sully rules  I love sully  you know what I  wish  I wish it was  two pterodactyls  and they had  like been  amazingly rare  birds  and these big  dummies  flew into a  plane engine  and are now  gone forever  I want to know  what happened  to the geese  look at this  guy's name  God  Captain  Chesley  Sully  Sullenberger  the third  Sully  probably had  Sully on his  helmet when he  was at  F4 Phantom  pilot  of course  yeah  Sully  call sign 
[00:36:00]  Sully  let's say  hi to  Brooklyn  Ace  Brooklyn  hey what's up  boys  how are you  hey listen  I was almost  on that flight  I took  USA last  month  and I was  going to  Charlotte  yesterday  you know  they're coming  boys  you know  they're coming  yeah  a little  known fact  when I went  on my honeymoon  I did take  a US airway  flight to  Charlotte  wow  see  that's crazy  right  I saw  a US 
[00:36:30]  airways  plane  I saw  one once  we're trying  to get  the like  more of the  unique spin  on this  whole thing  and of  course  you're going  to get  all the  9  9-11  and you  know  references  over and  over again  what  could have  been  touched upon  a point  that Tim  and I  had discussed  that if  you were  here in the  metropolitan area  on September  11th  you'll probably  never look  at a plane  flying low  again  and that  certainly  crosses the  minds  of everyone  who saw  that 
[00:37:00]  no it  didn't  no I  didn't  think  that  yeah  witnesses  struck  by how  smooth  it was  and yet  taken aback  at how  low  this plane  was flying  and of course  the memories  of September  11th  too vivid  for too  many people  who live  here in  the tri-state  area  that's a  different channel  we are going  to destroy  the river  right  third channel  witnesses  watched as  the plane  began a  gradual descent  reviving  memories  for some  of September  11th  it's coming  down  down  down  right in  the water  yep 
[00:37:30]  fourth news  network  so obviously  you see a jet  flying low  in the area  and you think  okay something  is seriously  wrong here  absolutely  in fact my  first reaction  was terrorism  because I  was here  for 9-11  that's a guy  though that's  not the  news people  first reaction  fifth different  news network  I can imagine  what's going  through your  mind seeing  a low flying  plane on the  Hudson River  and you think  it's September  11th  a lot of people  who saw that  that day  how about we 
[00:38:00]  think of it  as a separate  incident  why do you  have to tie  everything in  just because  it makes for  a better story  I understand  right  normally the  airlines are  quite high up  and this was  really a few  hundred feet  off the river  and immediately  I said this  is a problem  you know  first you think  September 11th  I guess in all  fairness though  they said that  what they went  right down the  Hudson River  before they hit  the Twin Towers  yeah and that  nice to know  there was no  scramble jets  or anything  I mean it's  just one of those  things where it's like  the guy could have  just made a quick 
[00:38:30]  left turn and  smashed into a  building  into anything  if it was you  know hijacked  or something  and again  there didn't seem  it was quick  but there didn't  seem to be any  thing we could  do about it  Sully circled  the Chrysler  building twice  then flew back  into the river  no signs of  terrorism  but with that  in mind  you're on the  29th floor  of a Manhattan  building  and seeing a  low flying  airliner  I know what  I would have  been thinking  right there  were you  thinking this  was something  more than  an accident  seeing that 
[00:39:00]  plane flying  at a low  level over  the Hudson  River  between  Manhattan  and New  Jersey  saying to  themselves  remembering  what happened  on September  11th  2001  saying to  themselves  oh my god  what is  happening  now  thank you  Wolf Blitzer  finally you  had a situation  for the  situation room  didn't you  as it's  descending  at about  170 miles  an hour  instead of  up a lot  higher  doing about  500 miles  an hour  I think  there's a  difference 
[00:39:30]  there  I like the  fact that  Wolf Blitzer  specified it  was September  11th  2001  because when  you say  September  11th  people a lot  of times  will have  a tendency  to think  of the  one in  94  yeah  there was  that great  Mets game  idiot Wolf  right  just say  9-11  we get it  right  yeah  September  11th  1999  wasn't as  important as  the one  in 2001  everyone here  remembers what  happened on  9-11  you see a low  flying passenger  jet  and you  have to  think  you have to  think  worry a bit  about is 
[00:40:00]  this terror  you just  gotta like  realize that  the news  no matter  what station  you tune  into  they're  the same  exact  person  same  same  exact  taking  the same  exact  angle  on every  effing  story  yap yap yap  yip yip yip yip  fucking head  let me say  hi to Mike  in Jersey  Mikey  hold on  ugliest man  on the planet  on channel 5  oh my good god  is he homely  gorgeous evening  if you're near  a TV right now  turn on Fox  homeliest man  ever alert  wow  it's Alfred Hitchcock 
[00:40:30]  with Hitler's mustache  oh my god  is he terrible  what an awful head  he looks like  one of the  butterballs  they threw  through the  engine  I don't know  who this guy  is or what  he's talking  about  he has a  big fat  jowly  Hitchcock  neck  and his  head  narrows  at the  top  and his  mouth is  crooked  he could  be the  ugliest  guy ever  he's of  course  talking about  the  plane  was he  a passenger  no  he investigates  he used to be  an NTSB  investigator  I trust them  by the way  more than the  FAA  FAA is like 
[00:41:00]  an agent  of the  airline  let's go to  Mike in Jersey  Mike  the phones  we can't keep up  with you guys  today but we'll  try  yes Mike  hey boys  how you doing  good evening  it looks like  God didn't need  Sully today  yeah that's true  man  God didn't need  a pilot  yeah God didn't  need a Sully  that's for sure  I'd love to see  these people  sitting  alright well  let's go with  this guy  because we're  arguing  was it a crash  or was it  a water landing  Jimmy has made  a very good point  that it was  certainly  a plane crash  yeah of course 
[00:41:30]  it was  because let me tell you  something  a water landing  if the wing  had snapped off  nobody would go  the wing snapped off  during a water landing  it's a crash  well that's just it  since the wing  didn't snap off  it's a water landing  you can't judge  what you call it  based on the results  if everyone can crawl out  and stand on the wings  it's a water landing  how about this  if you're flying  and you hit a mountain  and it just bounced off  or landed on a tree  and everybody stood on the wings  did they say  that was a bumpy  mountain landing  no 
[00:42:00]  they say it was a crash  I think Jimmy's  winning the argument  Anthony  it was a crash  right  let's say hi to Jeff  go ahead Jeff  hey what do you say guys  hey man  hey  listen  right now  there's people on simulators  that are trying to figure out  how this guy did this  you've got to deal with  a total loss of power  a loss of hydraulics  not knowing what the heck's going on  you've got to put the fires out  you've got to dump the fuel  you've got to hit the ditch switch  you've got to control the plane  you've got to call the towers 
[00:42:30]  and let them know  and you've got to talk calmly  to the people at the same time  are you kidding  this guy really is a hero  he just said we're ditching  yeah  we're ditching  and also the fuel  he didn't have time to dump  he didn't dump the fuel  hell no he didn't  but I'll say one thing  but Anthony  you don't lose hydraulics  Anthony gave us some knowledge though  he said that's one reason  why the plane stayed afloat  because of the fuel in the wings  he said buoyancy  very buoyant  buoyant  buoyant  I hate that word  buoyant  let me go to Pat  and then we've got to take a break  Brooklyn checking in  what's up Pat 
[00:43:00]  morning boys  hi  hey  I'm just wondering if  Geraldo is on the scene reporting  it's a person  it's a person  it's a person  stranded  nice  very good  it was Geraldo  thank god  they kept him away  from the crash site  crawl through the plane  to look to see if anybody  is still inside  watching the movie  the thing that makes this guy  amazing though  is that he didn't have much time  to react  because he was only at 3,500 feet  planes that have a lot of time  at 30,000 feet  they have plenty of time  to figure out what they can do 
[00:43:30]  this guy had to make  a very quick decision  good point  Anthony  are you secretly hoping  one of the survivors dies  so it takes all the good feelings  we got  away from us  no I find it amazing  I think what that guy did  was amazing  I'm just saying  it was ideal circumstances  for this situation  why haven't you said  Sully rules yet  Sully rules  everyone's saying it man  Sully rules  I said Sully rules  the guy did an amazing job  but it's not like he was  you know  see you had to say but  he's not 
[00:44:00]  do you see how wide  the Hudson is  compared to that plane  he landed it lengthwise  he landed it from New York  to Jersey that way  and then he spun it around  that would be a good trick  alright  Larry King  I mean he's just terrific  thank god we have him  to help us through  these tragedies  or these miracles  whatever you want to call it  this guy's so out of touch  he stinks  so when the lines  were dropped  from the Hindenburg  what happened next 
[00:44:30]  no Larry  it was a plane  that came down  so did you plan  on landing in the water  so lucky  Lindy was flying  I'm being told  what an ass  oh he was asking  the dumbest questions  he had Sanjay Gupta  that doctor  from CNN  worst name ever  he was on to talk  about things like  hypothermia  and Larry had a great  question about that  and then they had 
[00:45:00]  a pilot  Dr. Phil  they had  who was there  to talk about  the psychological  problems  that these survivors  might have  and he's a pilot  so he had that  to talk about  apparently  I didn't know  that Dr. Phil  was a pilot  I had a bunch  of people in my house  and when Dr. Phil  was on screen  everybody in the room  started moaning  like oh  why Dr. Phil  why Dr. Phil  enough with this clown  they should have  John Travolta on 
[00:45:30]  to talk about that  although only  the people's feet  had water on them  not their heads  they're showing it again  it's Ophian Anthony  they got the worst  animation on  the Today Show  as far as this  plane crash goes  here in New York City  the worst  they're trying to  depict what happened  it looks a lot like  Microsoft Flight Simulator  yeah  but 
[00:46:00]  boy it sure  isn't to scale  no  I forgot what channel  did it yesterday  but  they just showed  this  massive plane  landing in the  Hudson River  now they're showing  a movie clip  yeah great  to kind of  show people  what it would be like  anyway  did you guys see  the Google Earth one  though  from yesterday  yeah  that was some  sweet  sweet animation  they had  kind of show 
[00:46:30]  the altitude  and everything  yeah  Mike raised  an interesting  point  about  Sully has a  consulting firm  on safety  yes  yes he does  that's what  Sully does  so we think  that might have  been Sully  doing it on purpose  to get business  for the firm  up  yeah  and he's also  a notorious  goose hater  a lot of his  neighbors are saying  yes  he hates  geese  and they suspect  that he was aiming  for the geese  because Sully did  say there was  actually a really  weird cell phone 
[00:47:00]  call  when they were  taking off  he was talking  to a friend  of his  who lives  on the west  side of  Manhattan  and he said  look I'll be  there in an  hour  I forgot my  keys  yes  well  they just run  into these  geese  we got some  audio coming  out of  the tower  that's what's  great about  stuff like this  as the hours  pass you get  more and more  stuff  we're still  waiting for the  live video  someone has it  out there  they're negotiating  a good fee 
[00:47:30]  I'm thinking  because we were  really close to  getting it  if I had  stupid batteries  or a card  in my camera  I would have  had it  I would have  had it  I was that  close  is there any  footage of  Obama walking  out there  and getting  people and  bringing them  back to shore  no but he was  actually guiding  the plane down  he was on a  ferry  and he had  two things  he guided  Sully in  you know  you gotta start  believing  this was the  first miracle  of the  Obama presidency  the messiah  well he is  the messiah  we're gonna  expect a lot  more of these 
[00:48:00]  in the coming  years  nice to see  him out of  the news  for a day  Jesus Christ  but we do  have audio  coming in  from the tower  this is just  coming in  so why don't  we be one of  the first to  play for  everybody  they knew  what they  were getting  into  I say  let them  crash  well  look at this  passenger 
[00:48:30]  certain to  die  airline  negligent  there's a  sale at  pennies  someone had  a video  camera on  the plane  and they  got some  audio of  the stewardess  and what  they were  saying  in a moment  we'll ask  you to assume  crash positions  your life  jackets are  located under  your seat  place the  jacket over  your head  and when I  give the word  pull the cord  on the right  side flat  your seat  cushions are  also equipped  with a  flotation 
[00:49:00]  device  there you go  that was very  visual  striker you're  coming in  too fast  striker  good old  striker  below 700  now it's  still going  down  675  650  625  he's holding  he's holding  no no he's  down  he's down  yeah we got  exclusive audio  for the actual  plane this is  crazy  sound your  alarm bell  now  there's  sully  good old  sully  sully  alright now  everybody  get in  crash  position  this is such 
[00:49:30]  visual bits  I know  I know  we're trying  what can I  tell you  this is not  audio from the  crash  this is from  a movie  no  literal  Jim  we actually  got more  audio from  the tower  it's all over  the place  900 feet  up to 1300  feet  I think  sully did a  fine job  sully  alright  where are we  going  Larry King  yeah let's  do a little 
[00:50:00]  Larry King  because  he is a  dope  he has  just gotten  so out of  touch  you would  think  you know  these guys  are going  on the fly  here with  these late  breaking stories  like this  and really  have to  kind of  improv  but  man does  this guy  just not  have any  chops left  when it  comes to  the story  just happened  here's some  people  Larry interview  him  yeah  well he 
[00:50:30]  was talking  about  hypothermia  and he  just  showed  once again  how clueless  he is  he thought  it was  thermia  that couldn't  be controlled  can you  defeat  hypothermia  with  garlic  what if  you drink  cold  welch's  grape juice  too much  of it  Dr.  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  what  what is  hypothermia  can you  give us  what does  it take  to get  this guy  excited  by the  way  this is  the story  everyone's  talking  about  and he's  like  he doesn't 
[00:51:00]  I don't  want to  be here  even if  it's  a plane  crash  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  Dr.  Sanjay  Gupta  what  what is  hypothermia  can you  give us  a demonstration  what is  it  can it  kill  you  it  can  what do  you think  Larry  can it  kill  you  everyone  that's  ever  died  on  Everest  right  has  died  of  that  right  how about  we start  there  has  ever been  in cold  water  has  died  of  that  if  it  wasn't  drowning  well Larry  it works  like  Viagra  but on  your  whole  body  idiot 
[00:51:30]  you  understand  Viagra  don't  you  can it  kill  you  how important  are the  geese  boob  Larry  is  it  can  and it  can  set in  very  quickly  especially  when the  water is  that cold  the process  of hypothermia  begins right  away  and in fact  you're 37  minutes into  your show  right now  Larry  if someone  had been  in submerging  water  for as long  as you've  been on  the air  so far  they probably  would have  had some  of the most  profound  effects  of hypothermia  which can  lead to  unconsciousness  even death  why  would they 
[00:52:00]  watch my  show  in cold  water  I don't  understand  what you're  saying  and Larry  if someone  had been  in cold  water  since the  last time  you've been  relevant  they'd be  mummified  one of  those  frozen  mastodons  we would  be chipping  you out  of the  ice  he really  is  family  of the  geese  next  mother  goose  comment  even death 
[00:52:30]  take a look  at this  animation  here  Larry  quickly  the body  sort of  goes into  triage  when faced  with this  sort of  temperature  the heart  and the  brain  are sort  of the  most  important  areas  but  blood  gets  shunted  away  from all  these  other  areas  the body  starts to  get very  cold  see it  turn blue  there  and eventually  you start  to have  significant  problems  you start  to feel  a little  stuporous  lethargy  when you're  in the  water  Larry  you can  lose  heat  so much  quicker  than  air  so 32  degree  water  temperature  is  much  worse  than  the same  temperature  on  land 
[00:53:00]  you can  only get  hypothermia  in the  water  just  explain it  perfectly  you idiot  tell that  to somebody  that's  trapped  in the  woods  on a  snowy  day  how is  he so  somebody  trapped  in an  avalanche  or something  can you  get it  on earth 
[00:53:30]  is it  possible  to get  it  on this  planet  temperature  on land  Larry  you can  only get  hypothermia  in the  water  no  you can  get  hypothermia  on land  as well  it's just  much easier  to get  it in  the water  because  you're  losing  heat  so much  more  quickly  what does  the temperature  have to be  for it  to occur  75  not  understanding  that  varying  temperatures  will dictate  how long  it takes  for you  to get  hypothermia  you can  get  hypothermia  starting  at 
[00:54:00]  30  in  75  degree  water  it's  going  to take  a while  but  you're  going  to get  it  right  if  you're  in  you know  a 35  degree  water  it's  going to  happen  a lot  faster  but  Larry  King  Steven S  from Bayshore  is Larry  why didn't he  simply land  in warm  water  and avoid  the freezing  issue  I like  I like  let me ask  what the hell  is a  goop  anyway  oh Larry  just go 
[00:54:30]  away  already  losing  heat  so much  more  quickly  what does  the temperature  have to be  for it  to occur  well it  depends  it depends  a little bit  on the  individual  it depends  a little bit  on what  they're wearing  as well  but even  water  around  69  70  degrees  if you're  in it  long  enough  unprotected  you can develop  hypothermia  there as well  because you're  just constantly  losing heat  from the body  into the water  around you  and you could  die of what  organ failure  yeah  you die  well you can  die of organ  failure  or you could  just  if you lose  consciousness  and you're  in the water  it might 
[00:55:00]  start to  aspirate  and you  could  essentially  drown  Dr. Phil  what is the  emotional aspect  going to be  on Alberto  what do you  think  on Alberto  what do you  think  Alberto  was the guy  that was just  on every  god damn  news program  they couldn't  shuffle this  guy around  last night  enough  and I  heard his  story  too many  times  you didn't  want to  hear it  anymore  I didn't  want to  hear  I was  almost  you know  he was  just  trying to  doze  just  leaned  his head  on the  window  and was  going to  sleep  when all  of a sudden 
[00:55:30]  he heard  a bang  in the  left  engine  and all  right  heard it  enough  he's  going to  be on  a flight  this  morning  he's  got  things  to  do  yeah  he's  got  to  go  back  to  his  family  I guess  and when  Dr.  Phil  and they  said  what will  the impact  be  he'll go  well  like myself  the more  cameras in  front of him  the bigger  and irrelevant  whore he'll  become  and he'll  eventually be  hated by  everybody  Dr.  Phil's a  creep  he sucks  honk  honk  honk  honk  let me  first  give you  my condolences 
[00:56:00]  to your  family  did  have you  ever had  family  fly into  a jet  engine  honk  honk  honk  honk  that's  fascinating  when it  comes to  flying  how important  are your  feathers  honk  honk  you know  why do  they call  that a  bill  I pay  a bill  but you  have a  bill  on your  face  comment  you find  it hard  to chew 
[00:56:30]  gum  with that  thing  doesn't  it just  fall  out  the  sides  honk  honk  can't  you see  it  it's  a  big  plane  more  exclusive  interview  with the  goose  family  what an  ass  Larry  King  is  honk  honk  honk  we're  talking 
[00:57:00]  with  Gossage  the  Gossage  family  how tragic  what was  he doing  up there  were any  baseballs  lodged  in the  engine  what  did it  happen  when  Maverick  ejected  out  did  goose  fly  into  the  engine  of the  plane  what  happened  you 
[00:57:30]  know  I  used  to  goose  my  secretaries  who  would  do  it  to  a  jet  engine  that's  crazy  let me  say hi to  Don in  Baltimore  Don how  are you  hey how you  doing  pretty good  buddy  hey  Goofa said  that  hypothermia  make you  stupid  and lethargic  so somebody  better put a  blanket  on  E-Rock  E-Rock  that one  was for  you  he turns 
[00:58:00]  it around  and goes  for E-Rock  nice little  spin there  we'll go to  Miller Place  never checks  in  what's up  Christian  how you  doing boys  good morning  good morning  I was wondering  maybe Larry  had  what's the  plural of  goose  goose  thanks anyway  there were no  survivors in that  joke  too bad  Sully wasn't  piloting that  joke  he'd have  brought it in  awful flavor 
[00:58:30]  savor under  his nose  the only  problem we  have with  Sully is the  pedo mustache  right  Sully's  favorite game  is smell  my stash  we'll look  past the  pedo mustache  because he's  a hero  today  he certainly  is  his stash  is enraging  you would  cross the  street if  you saw  him coming  your way  you have  no idea  how fast  creep  the most  impressive  thing I saw  on TV  as far as  this thing  goes  did you  hear about  the survivor  that actually 
[00:59:00]  called his  family while  he's still  in the middle  of the Hudson  River  to say he's  okay  yeah you  would have  to kind  of do  that  like hey  if you  watch  the TV  don't  worry  I'm  fine  I'll  wave  and they're  like you're  behind home  plate at  the Yankee  game  hey  and some  dumb  report is  like your  cell phone  survived  and he's  like yeah  I only got  wet from  like the  knees down  I figured  I'm sitting  here in the  Hudson River  I might as  well call  my family  yeah  that's a  hell of a  call  hi  yeah  put on TV  yeah put on  the news  I was just  in a plane  crash  where are you 
[00:59:30]  I'm still  in the river  what did you  did you see  it happen  I'm on the  wing  there's a man  man on the  wing  there's a lot  of men on  the wing  a lot of  yeah the  one guy's  stupid wife  is probably  like so  you're gonna  be late  yeah  you know  this always  happens  you say  you're gonna  be there  I'm waiting  at the  airport  to pick  you up  jump into  the water  and freeze  you know  someone out  there's  annoyed  because  of course 
[01:00:00]  they didn't  make their  destination  what did  you just  hand me  there  it's  another  voicemail  from a  survivor  of the  survivor  of the  tragedy  where did  they make  this call  from the  river  or something  like that  I guess  right after  they got  off the  plane  I just  wanted to  let everybody  know  that I'm  okay  I know  that everybody  has been  wondering  about me  because of  the U.S.  U.S.  Airways crash  here in  New York  and you're  wondering  if I'm  okay  I'm fine  I wasn't  on the  plane  I don't  fly U.S.  Airways  I also 
[01:00:30]  don't fly  to LaGuardia  but I  live on  the west  side  right by  the water  20 blocks  from where  the plane  went down  and I  wasn't  outside  what  happened  I was  in my  apartment  and approximately  the time  it happened  I was  deep  in a  girl's  just  thinking  if that  plane  had tried  to get  back to  LaGuardia  and made  a left  and banged  it could  have hit  my building  and killed  me  and that's  how I would  have died  I'm okay  right now  and I just  want everybody  to know  that I'm  okay  and I'm  gonna be  fine  boo 
[01:01:00]  I booed  myself  from my  petering out  at the end  boo  that was you  Jimmy  yeah I  called the  number  I was just  Jimmy told me  what he was  doing during  this crash  Jimmy was  playing  goose  and the  girl was  playing  engine  that's  right  with the  same results  or if she  had him  face down  in water  how that  ties in  but  all right 
[01:01:30]  listen more  of your phone  calls after  the break  877-212  on a big  day for the  show  big day  we're right  on top  of this  this huge  story here  in New York  City  it's the  Opie and  Anthony  show  you're  listening to  Opie and  Anthony  there's  something  very  annoying  fucking  thing  sucks  www  tdd.com  has a  picture of  our old  friend who's  going to be  one of the  guys on  Celebrity  Apprentice  also

[01:05:00]  everybody  our exclusive  wait we  actually have a  sweeper now  oh  live from the  opium anthony  show studios  more exclusive  coverage of  miracle on the  Hudson  that's right  this is the  place to be  today right  no one else  is talking about  this crap  team coverage  team coverage  that's right  on the opium  anthony show  of miracle on the  Hudson  miracle on the  Hudson  of course  yesterday 
[01:05:30]  wow what a  dramatic day  well obviously  listen to the  dramatic music  yes  as an airbus  jet  dramatically  had a  dramatic  crash  landing  dramatically  in the  dramatic  Hudson River  reminding us  all of 9-11  yes  the goose count  is still rising  is it  at this point  yes  we're up to  15 dead  geese  why don't 
[01:06:00]  the Canadian  geese need  a passport  what were they  doing over  our airports  just more  garbage from  Canada  we just did  a fine break  for I don't  know seven  people in the  studio  some of those  lines have to  be on the  radio  oh well  where did it  start there  Jimmy with  the flying  thing and  Kenny and  we're secretly  hoping that  Sully has  kitty porn  on his  computer 
[01:06:30]  we just  want Sully  to have  some sort  of a  checkered  past  nothing  would make  me happier  than just  for them  for some  reason  to need  Sully's  laptop  for something  in the  investigation  to do  with the  aircraft  and just  find the  most horrific  child pornography  on it  and then we  all have to  awkwardly ignore  the fact that  they found  this stuff  or ignore the  fact that he  was a hero  you just kind of  like exile him  like all right  well remember him  yeah  well way to go  Sully  way to go 
[01:07:00]  and then Kenny  said Kenny  said to me can you  imagine if your  laptop was on there  with a book on it  and you had to  leave your laptop  on it  like if I was  writing a book  whatever  he was what an  argument that would  be  I said well I  would just put it  under my shirt  and take it  there's no way  I'd leave my  laptop behind  it wouldn't  happen  yeah  never I would  be that guy  believe me  if I had  material on there  that I needed  forget it  unless it was a  fire then I  could rewrite it  and then Kenny  went through the  whole thing of  how he flies  and why he  keeps his shoes 
[01:07:30]  on and you  know doesn't  doesn't get so  comfortable where  he wouldn't be  ready in the  case of an  emergency  to evac  he says that's  why I keep my  shoes on  and what did  you say Jimmy  I pointed out  that that was  really good  planning because  he'd been flying  for 25 years  uncomfortably in  the event of  standing in the  Hudson River for  10 minutes  good thinking  and then what  did you say you  do  I would hold  my thumbs so  they can identify  me  see so he puts 
[01:08:00]  his thumbs in  his four fingers  like you're making  a fist but with  your thumbs inside  sure and holds it  so they can  identify you  so you don't  lose your  thumbs  yeah they  could fingerprint  them  like they  wouldn't notice  who you were  by that big  dumb head poking  through the roof  of the plane  it would look like  a child's toy  like a Lego  plane with a big  stupid head  sticking out of it  I hold my  thumbs  yeah  to match the  DNA with a  baboon and they  would know Kenny  was on the flight 
[01:08:30]  or Stephen S from  Bayshore working  overtime today  Stephen S writes  this just in  Sully worked for  12 years as Gary  Glitter's personal  pilot flying him to  Thailand  yeah that could be a  problem  oh my god  let's say hi to  Andy in Colorado  he's an aircraft  mechanic  Andy  everybody wants  in today  what do you got  Andy  good morning boys  and happy birthday  little Jimmy  thank you very much  this plane thing  has overshadowed  my big day  it sure has Jimmy  I love you guys 
[01:09:00]  this show  hey anyways  no I was just  calling because of  the question of  how they would  control the  aircraft after  both engines  have been lost  and that close  to takeoff  they would probably  have the auxiliary  power unit  or the APU  up and running  providing electrical  power to the  hydraulic systems  of the aircraft  but in the event  that they didn't  there's another  apparatus  that's pretty  complex but  simple  it's like a  pinwheel  yes  it's a little 
[01:09:30]  pinwheel that  drops out of the  bottom of the  plane  I don't think  they would have  time for that  and the APU  didn't go out  Bird didn't hit  the APU  right  but in the event  that it wasn't on  in the event  that it wasn't on  the APU  if it wasn't on  then the  Rat Merrick  turbine went  instantaneously  pop out of the  aircraft  and the  air flow  across that  would provide  the  you know  I think  this discussion  APUs  no  that's that  little  you ever see 
[01:10:00]  when you get  on a plane  that little  bit of  jet fuel  the exhaust  that you see  coming out  of like the  little  just under  the tail  that's a  little turbine  that runs  everything when  the main  engines aren't on  that's what  your electricity  yeah  even when the  engines quit  you still got  hydraulics  alright let's go  to Aaron in  Cincinnati  Aaron  hey how you guys  doing  hi  you guys still  pulling for Pete  Rose to be in the  Hall of Fame or what  or did he give up  on that  it'll never happen 
[01:10:30]  alright  what do you got  I got a problem  with Anthony's theory  on fuel buoyancy  oh yeah  okay  yeah  because  you know  our boat's full  of air  what  when  for something  to float  it doesn't want  to be full  of a liquid  does it  well if the  liquid's more  buoyant than  the actual  water  your idea  was that  it's going  to float  your idea 
[01:11:00]  was that  it helped  with buoyancy  oh  if it was  empty  then it's  air  of course  then  you're going  to get  more buoyancy  I know  yeah  exactly  your theory  stunk  it was  supposed to  be filled  with anvils  when they  took off  it was  all I was  saying  I'm just  saying that  the fuel  is lighter  than water  so it didn't  hinder  the plane  by weighing  it down  I don't believe  that's what  Anthony said  I think  I said  that maybe  hey look  they had 
[01:11:30]  a bunch  of fuel  on the plane  and Anthony  said well  that helped  with buoyancy  oh okay  well  thank you sir  for straightening  out  just  be right  my  then  happily  we're taking  more of your  phone calls  877-212-0NA  and we're  kind of arguing  and sort of  is hinting  that this was  more a water  landing  Jimmy says  it was  absolutely a  crash  no matter  how you  look at  it  yeah  it's a  crash  it's a plane  crash  yeah  well  what  I'm just  saying well  it looked  like a water  landing 
[01:12:00]  so how  was your  landing  great  we got  in the  boat  you have  to say  that  you crashed  it's a really  weird flight  really how  was it  how why  was the  terminal  really weird  no we  we boarded  a ferry  off the  wing  how was  there was  a water  landing  all right  you make  a good  point  there  Jim  they also  asked for 
[01:12:30]  anyone who  saw luggage  floating in  the river  so that  seems to  make you  think it  might have  been a  crash  too  oh  it didn't  look like  anything  except a  few seats  were floating  I don't know  and you brought  up the question  of pets  yeah were there  any little  puppies or  kittens  you know  there had  to be  and they  don't want  to acknowledge  that  because it's  such a  feel good  story  yeah  I believe  the media  will grab  it  oh they're  just dying  for death  right now  they want  death  so bad  blazed over  a labrador  retriever  in a  sunken cage 
[01:13:00]  right  just sitting  there floating  little guppies  nipping at  him  floating down  the Hudson  River  someone's  pet  ruining  everything  for  Sully  the hero  how was  your flight  great I  now have  river sewage  in my  socks  so that  would make  it a  crash  Jimmy  that is  unequivocally  a crash  when you  step on a  fish  leaving an  aircraft  you crash  when you  got to  wring out  your socks  and drape  them over  a radiator 
[01:13:30]  in some  horrible hotel  in New York  City  you were in a  crash  yeah  that's a cool  shot of them  all on that  wing though man  that is a  solid shot  hey Danny  Danny pulled  a family  guy clip  because  we know  oh there  he is  that's the  dude that  was on TV  all day  yesterday  kind of  looks like  a young  Lars  from Metallica  stupid haircut  they got him  on the  today show  thank god  thank god  Matt Lauer  is in  who is that  little awful  man  who is that  puppet  what a bunch 
[01:14:00]  of creeps  on this  flight  god almighty  where was  this plane  going to  it was  chartered by  Ringling  Brothers  starting to look  like no  one would  have missed  these people  the more  you see  them on TV  their families  all chipped  in  they said  Sully  ditch it  god almighty  they were  going to  some island  to be  put down  by the  government  their families  there with  cages  all releasing  geese  as the  plane  takes off  that's right  god put  together a 
[01:14:30]  plane of  zeros  and then  maybe one  guy got on  at the last  minute to ruin  everything  we need that  guy for later  on  and in the  goose  community  they're  hailing  the two  heroes  that brought  the plane  down  of ugly  people  honk  they sacrificed  their lives  honk  honk  honk  they've been  trying to take  Sully out  for years  this is a  problem between  the geese  and Sully  like in  Orca 2  personal  when it came  back  yes  this time  it's personal  how did Sully  not hear them 
[01:15:00]  they're always  honking their  horns  phew  I even  got a crash  on my  crash  how are  they going  to make  a movie  if this  was a  three minute  flight  but you  know  the movie  is coming  how are  they going  to spin  this into  a movie  I know  it's like  ten minutes  well they  got to do  the whole  thing  if you  ever watch  any of  the airport  movies  the first  three quarters  of the movie  is getting  to know  the passengers  so you have  some kind  of vested  interest  and then  the last 
[01:15:30]  quarter  of the movie  is the  actual  disaster  so they'll  do the  whole  you know  terminal  and the  people going  I'll go  have a cup  of coffee  you want  something  honey  and all  that happy  horse crap  just leave  it alone  don't make  this into  a movie  but we  know the  media really  wanted death  destruction  fire  blood  all that  they didn't  get it  and it  reminded Danny  of a family  guy clip  yeah  quagmire  is supposed  to be on  a plane  to land  it and he  doesn't make  it so  then I  think Peter  has to land  the plane  nobody dies 
[01:16:00]  everything is  fine  but you know  how they  go to the  news on  family guy  all the time  so first  they did  the simulated  this is what  it might  have looked  like  which all  the news  is doing  exactly  just that  computer imagery  of the geese  flying  into the plane  just really  reminded me  of this clip  alright  let's take a  listen  our top  story  there was  drama in the  skies of  quahog  today  as a  transnational  767  was forced  to make  a crash  landing  that's  right  I am  as if  the world  weren't  already scary  enough  it seems 
[01:16:30]  you can't  even get  on a plane  safely  these days  channel 5  has the  spectacular  footage  fortunately  no one  was injured  however  using state-of-the-art  channel 5  computer technology  will show you  how disastrous  it could have  been  here's  here's  Todd  here's how it 
[01:17:00]  would have  Now here's how it would have looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies,  but one passenger had survived, gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.  I'm alive!  But boy, am I angry!  Someone's gonna have to pay for this!  Why? Why? 
[01:17:30]  Is this because I overcooked the roast?  Powerful stuff.  You'd have to be made of stone not to feel saddened by that.  They nailed that, right?  Nice.  Let's say hi to Jimmy.  Jimmy, how are you?  Good, man.  Hey.  Not you!  But I am Jimmy.  What do you got, Jimmy?  I am Poster.  Good morning, boys.  How's it going?  Good.  I was watching the news last night.  They are so horrible.  Chris Matthews actually referred to this as a bird attack, 
[01:18:00]  and that's when I shut the TV off.  A bird attack?  Bird attack.  No one's got the good headline yet.  It's all just miracle on the Hudson over and over again.  Yeah.  Or hero on the Hudson.  It's just ridiculous.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It's not ridiculous.  Okay, guys.  It's pretty effing cool.  I wish I was one of the passengers just so I could constantly say Boyd.  That's what I would say to the news people is that they told us a Boyd hit the engine.  There was a bunch of Boyds. 
[01:18:30]  A what, sir?  A what?  A bunch of Boyds they took off, and they said Boyds was attacking the plane.  Oh, look at Al Roker.  Oh, he's gone already.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus.  Let me say his head through a jet engine.  Shoot him through an engine.  Fat butterball head.  Glasses.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Oh, my God.  It's the most dramatic thing I've ever seen.  Passenger standing on the wing.  Sully, he's smiling.  He knew the whole time. 
[01:19:00]  Sully knew.  Liggy lunggy.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, the passengers are standing on the wing.  Awful speech by Sully.  Saved your lives.  I guess I'll be seeing you soon.  And then he proceeds to just crash every plane he flies.  How funny would it be if on Sully's next takeoff, the plane just blew up?  Maybe not funny, but ironic.  Ironic is probably a better.  Ironic. 
[01:19:30]  Ironic.  Let's put a ransom out there.  A thousand dollars for the first person that brings us Sully.  All tied up.  Then we'll just kick him in the groin all morning.  Let's tell everyone we really don't mean that.  We don't want anyone to really bring us Sully.  Bring us Sully.  Where is Sully?  Does anyone know where Sully is?  He's got to be.  Somebody has to know.  He's probably being.  We're well connected with this city.  So maybe someone could give us a little communique and tell us where Sully is.  He's probably just talking to the U.S. air people.  He's probably out of New York already.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dan the fireman. 
[01:20:00]  Dan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to tell you that what the guys saw in the water, it wasn't luggage.  It was actually float stuck in these those big inner circle boats that were throwing them  down to the victims in case they fell in the water.  Okay.  Yeah.  I didn't see any luggage.  No luggage.  I think it's all still, you know.  In there.  In there.  Getting all wet.  Is that airtight, though?  It's probably not wet.  Well, who knows now.  Might be a little dented. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  I don't think it's pressurized anymore.  Yeah.  Oh.  Might be a little damp in there.  God, if you had something that you really needed.  Exactly.  So we're looking for a better headline, and we're also doing the, you know, it has to  be a crash.  Yeah.  Sure does.  If blah, blah, it's a crash.  So we'll take a few more of those, too.  I'm from the school of thought that he landed it in the water, unscathed. 
[01:21:00]  The plane didn't look very damaged.  It didn't break apart.  Everybody lived.  So I was calling it a water landing.  Yes.  And Jimmy, on the other hand, is calling it a crash.  Yes.  Because it is.  As we look at it, it's submerged.  Yes.  Perhaps.  Yeah, that looks like a landing.  Perhaps.  Well, I didn't say that after the landing, there wasn't some complications.  That's just like taxiing, you know.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Hey, we should maybe play a little Celine Dion today, man. 
[01:21:30]  Perfect, right?  Bing, bing.  Welcome to the Hudson River.  We hope you fly with us again.  The time is.  Yes.  Yeah, the local time is what it was six minutes ago.  If you look out your window to your left, you can see traffic on the West Side Highway.  And if you look out the window to your right, you can see a Dodge Dart parked.  You'll see an airport, which would have been very convenient if we would have been able to make it there.  Yes.  And if you look straight ahead at Newark, you'll see planes from a good airline taking off successfully and not just hitting geese all willy-nilly. 
[01:22:00]  Like mustachioed creep all of a fly in this bucket of bolts.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  They're so cold and so wet.  Just give them a kayak.  That wasn't that bad story.  It was all right. 
[01:22:30]  All right, we're going to do some FUs, I think.  Yeah, that's what we're going to do.  Go to the FU line, see what people are bitching about today.  You shouldn't be bitching about anything.  Exactly.  We had a wonderful day yesterday.  My God.  Excitement.  Were you on the plane or something?  Yeah, you just.  Wonderful for the people that were on the plane.  You just get caught up in the whole thing, though, Ann.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  God, you're becoming such a fag.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  Good feeling about something good that happened.  It was a nice day, yes. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  If it doesn't involve me, I could give a flying.  No kidding, that's your problem.  I was actually.  A major problem, actually.  I drove down the west side and was throwing rocks at the passengers.  Get out of the water, you bums.  You showboats.  I was throwing rocks at them.  They hate those passengers.  Bunch of show-offs.  Bunch of attention-seeking.  Whores.  Get back in the plane.  Out on the wing, waving.  Exactly.  Get in there.  Take your seat.  Yeah, me, me, me, me, me. 
[01:23:30]  Why don't you just stand on top of where the pilot, like on the actual roof of the plane,  and do the Watutsi?  Big show-off.  We got Eddie in Rockland before the FU line.  Eddie.  Yeah.  What's up, Eddie?  Eddie.  Hey, guys, if so it can't take back off, it's a crash landing.  All right.  Hey, there you go.  There you go.  Yes.  If you can't take back off.  Hey, he didn't try.  Yes.  That's a good point.  You know, you never know. 
[01:24:00]  If the plane is now out of the air, and you have to evacuate before you drown, you did  not land the plane.  All right.  He was just a damn good pilot who crashed a plane successfully.  Good point.  He said, I'm going to ditch.  He didn't say, I'm going to land.  He said, I'm going to ditch.  Let's go to John the Trucker.  John.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard, John.  How are you, John?  You know, Sully had to look over his shoulder at a couple of the women, give him a wink, and 
[01:24:30]  say, you know you owe me.  I think he's got to steward his wife already.  Yeah, he's got to.  And he didn't say, he didn't say, ditch.  He said, bitch.  Punch it out.  Yeah.  Punch it out.  You can't punch out.  You're already in the water.  Please.  Yeah.  If you were Sully, you would have aimed for the GW Bridge.  All right.  Let's check out the F.U. line as we go to break here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:25:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest patch of F.U.s.  You have nine new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, let me give a big fuck you to my asshole.  Because I'm tired of laying in bed and having my stomach rumbling and bumbling.  Then I go sit on the bowl and push for 20 minutes and nothing comes out.  Fuck you, asshole.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to Bernie Madoff.  I hope you rot in prison, you lousy fuck.  And I hope to God that you get anally raped and shot, too. 
[01:25:30]  Next message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. and thank you to my ex-boyfriend,  who left me for a stripper and helped me to avoid an inevitable F.T.D.  Next message.  Hey, this is Elliot from Asheville, and I'd like to send a big F.U. to whoever broke into my car,  broke my window, and didn't even take anything.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, but I'm up in Canada, and I want to give a big F.U. to my former boss,  who fired me two weeks before my child was due. 
[01:26:00]  F.U., asshole.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Scott from Jersey.  I just want to give a big fuck you to the company I worked for.  Bunch of fucking bastards.  Fuck you.  You fucking filthy insignificant.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send out a big F.U. to the incoming president-elect.  You communist bastard.  I can't believe this fucking country put you in office.  Big F.U. to you.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I want to say, fuck you, Ashley. 
[01:26:30]  You left me and the kids to fuck for dope.  I hope you fucking die.  Next message.  I'm going to send a big fuck you out to my bride.  I'm 14 years.  I walked in on her yesterday with an eight and a half inch cock in her.  I couldn't do that for her, apparently, so she had to get it for my best friend.  Fuck you.  Hope you liked it.  Deadbeat.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye. 
[01:27:00]  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, salute to Sully, an American hero.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, 877-212-ON-A.  Phone's just lit.  Let's go right back to them.  Sean in North Carolina.  What's up, Sean?  It's got to be a crash.  I think in general aviation terms, any time a plane lands in the water and Mr. O'Rourke  and Tattoo aren't there to greet you, it's a crash. 
[01:27:30]  Unfortunately, how cool would it have been if he hadn't died this week, if they rammed him  up in some little midget and had him on the edge on the shore waving everybody.  That would have been sweet.  Oh, boy.  You did so well.  Yeah, you went a little too far there, buddy.  So well with part one.  Yeah.  Come on.  We've got to get the phones, Travis.  Wow.  That really reeks.  I can smell it from here.  I had kale last night.  Kale?  Yeah, I ate a health food place.  What is kale?  Kale is like, it stinks.  Something dead?  I have kale farts.  Kale is awful. 
[01:28:00]  So he goes into Travis's little gas chamber that he screens the phones from and lets loose.  Yeah.  Poor Travis doesn't know what to do.  He can't breathe.  Can't help it.  It sucks to be you, I guess.  Healthy.  Tony in Jersey, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  President Landon.  What did you say?  What?  Pheasant landing.  Like a pheasant's a bird.  What's that mean, though? 
[01:28:30]  Pheasant landing.  Landing.  I understand you're trying for the big headline, but that...  Yeah, but what does it mean?  Pheasant landing.  The bird.  And they cross a plane.  No, no, no, no.  But how come it's a landing, though?  Yeah, what does the pheasant part have to do with it?  Because it hit...  Well, I'm going with Anthony.  I say that it was a landing.  Why'd you say pheasant?  If no one...  Because geese were involved and...  Yeah, but I don't get...  Might as well go with what the flock. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  I don't get pleasant, though, sir.  Okay, fine.  Fine.  You win, Jimmy.  Not just me.  Yes.  Anthony, too.  Everyone wins.  You lose.  I don't get pleasant.  Look, he was proud of his line, and, you know, now he feels a little silly.  Well, he shouldn't be proud of it.  A little silly.  Nick in Cleveland, help us out, Nick.  Hey, okay, let's call it an emergency water landing, because nobody died.  So if no one dies, then it's a landing?  Well, you crash a car. 
[01:29:30]  Emergency water landing.  Well, if, uh...  Yeah, that's a good point.  By the way, yeah, if you're driving, right?  If you're driving your car, and you hit a guardrail, and you wind up in the lake, nobody  says, wow, that was a really wet parking.  What happened?  I crashed my car.  It was a water parking, yes.  I think we're pretty much determining this was indeed a crash.  Of course it was a crash.  I think our goal is to have everyone arguing this point all day long at the office. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Just drive your coworkers nuts with this one.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  I mean, when Christopher Reeve, after the whole horse thing, when he was laying there  on the grass, would they say, uh, hey, this was a, oh, boy, my tail's spinning ice.  Oh, go, go.  Punch it out.  Pitted.  So pitted.  I punched out.  You did.  Yep.  Uh, Kevin, what do you got?  Good evening.  Hey.  Hi, Kevin.  If a plane doesn't make it to point B, it crashed. 
[01:30:30]  I'm going to watch it.  There you go.  Punch it out.  All right.  What else is going on today?  Does anyone care?  This is it, right?  I know.  Now, of course, blast of cold air, but no one cares about that.  It's 12 degrees or something this morning.  And I think the president said goodbye to the nation yesterday.  Man, does he have the worst timing in the history of this country?  No one cared.  No one cared. 
[01:31:00]  It didn't make the paper even.  It was a non-story.  Say goodbye.  El Cadegeese.  Worst approval ratings since Nixon as he leaves office.  Since Nixon.  Nixon got the boot.  Yeah.  The worst since.  Really?  Yep.  Boy, his approval rating didn't go up his entire second term.  No.  It just plummeted. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, we got another headline coming in.  Greg in New York.  How are you?  Hey, I got a good headline for you.  Yes.  Goose gets softened, but passengers end up with dip.  And get dipped.  Oh, my God.  Were you on the plane?  Oh, my God.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm cold.  That's all. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy.  What was that, Lewin?  All right.  Let's go to Eric in Boston.  Eric.  Yeah, hey.  I say it's a landing because if the plane doesn't explode on impact, I'd definitely call that a landing.  No, it's not a landing.  Jimmy?  He makes a good point.  He does not make a good point.  He makes a very good point, Jimmy.  No, he doesn't.  I'm starting to think it might have been a water landing now.  Water landing?  No, it wasn't a water landing.  Why not, Jimmy?  It was a non-explodent crash. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, well, here's a great headline coming in from Gary in Minnesota.  Gary.  Yeah, headline reads, U.S. Airlines go down.  Do they expect foul play?  Ah, foul because it's a water foul.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good, buddy.  The pilot managed to make a successful crash landing.  Uh-oh.  Now we've got a problem.  Successful crash landing.  Hey, now you have two things happening here. 
[01:33:00]  It was a successful crash landing.  They do say any landing you can walk away from is a successful landing.  Yeah, but it's crash.  That's correct.  So he had a successful crash landing yesterday.  I think that saying was from World War I, I think.  Steve, you just ruined our bit.  How do we get around a successful crash landing?  You don't need to.  Well, we're trying to discuss if it was a crash or a landing.  Successful is just an adjective.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Crash is the actual verb.  Crash.  You know, it was a flowery crash landing.  He successfully crashed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he's saying.  Good job.  If Sully had one ounce of piloting skills, he'd have made it to Newark Airport.  What a stupid do.  He tumbles into the river.  Panicking fag.  Sully makes me sick.  Sully sucks.  You wanted to be a cowboy.  Yeah, exactly.  Why land in Newark when you could, like, show off some skills?  And the plane took off 18 minutes late.  The plane had taken off on time.  What do you think those geese hung out and waited for that flight? 
[01:34:00]  No.  Sully was probably taking, like, a hangover dump.  Sully was on the ball reading the Wall Street Journal upside down, vomiting.  Maybe that's why he hasn't been seen yet.  Of course it is.  I'm trying to sober him up.  His face is all red.  He hasn't been sober in two decades.  He has whiskey in his mustache.  Look, we want to put you on TV, but you got to do something here.  Can we put some makeup on that red nose?  This is an American hero we're talking about. 
[01:34:30]  It's all Sully's fault.  He hates New Jersey.  That's why he aimed for the river.  He didn't want to land there.  Yeah.  Everyone, within hours, he went from obscure pilot to American hero.  Look how fast that happened.  He will get an invitation from the president.  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  Obama.  This was Obama's first miracle, my friends.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  You've got to start believing.  As our Lord, as our new Lord and Savior, Obama.  They say he's the Messiah, and look what happens a few days before he officially is the president.  Come on.  Come on.  You've got to start believing.  John and Monroe, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  If you need a barge and a flatbed to get the plane back to the hang-up, it's a crash.  It's a crash.  Absolutely.  Valid point.  Valid point.  If you board a plane, and then before you take your luggage to the hotel, you have to put a hairdryer on it, you crashed. 
[01:35:30]  Let's go to Paul.  How are you?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Go, Paul.  Hey, I'm from Long Island.  I'm both from Long Island.  I was going to say that it's not a landing if you have to.  When the pilot says you have to brace for impact, then you, oh, man, I'm stuttering. 
[01:36:00]  I'm sorry.  Yes, you are.  You're a sorry son of a bitch.  You lost both engines, my friend.  Hold on.  You're going in.  Come on, Sully.  Bring it in.  There's a lot of nervous people on the phone today.  Hold on.  Start over now.  I just got to work.  I'm trying to fiddle with my keys.  I'm going to lock the door.  He's trying to unlock it.  Does Sully land in a plane with no engines, and you can't unlock a door and talk?  And you act like you're bombing in front of two countries because you have a key.  Come on.  All right.  Give it a try now. 
[01:36:30]  Get your thoughts together and go.  It's not a landing when you consider it.  When the pilot has to say you have to embrace your impact and do it so much like filling up the water.  And it's not a joke if it's more than 45 minutes.  You suck.  You suck so bad.  A bit wordy.  A bit wordy, Paul.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  It's not a landing.  It's just...  We've taken the question. 
[01:37:00]  I'm shivering.  All right.  Sorry.  Go to work.  Go make some money.  All right, Paul.  There you go.  People on the wing of the plane had more calm, cool, collectedness than you're displaying with your key.  He's got his key out.  What are you working?  He couldn't talk.  Nuclear reactor, you nervous idiot.  He's panicking.  Yeah.  He's in a missile silo turning his key.  You dummy.  I say if you're stampeding over kids and women, it's a crash to get out of the plane.  They said women and children first.  I know I'd be selfish and I'd yell, like, F the babies and I'd run out in front of them and then I'd have to explain myself. 
[01:37:30]  I didn't mean that.  Wow.  Steve from Bayshore.  Anthelini ended more smoothly than that joke.  Anthelini ended less smoothly than that flight.  Yes.  I almost said more smoothly than that flight.  Oh, that would have been silly.  It's like calling E-Rock smaller than a killer whale.  I know, which is also inaccurate.  We've got a rhyming headline coming in from Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill.  Hey, what's up, gents? 
[01:38:00]  Hey.  While the geese were cut to a sliver, we had to land in the river.  Wow.  And then he turned the volume up to see if the silence he heard.  And down he goes at the five-yard line.  What's the call here?  Now they're going to say no.  He's out of bounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're playing with a toy plane on Channel 5 on a desk.  Yeah.  They're like, the plane has to avoid a newspaper and a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  And a giant's hand. 
[01:38:30]  We think King Kong grabbed the plane and threw it into the water.  Oh, my God.  There's a guy with an awful white tie.  Yeah.  What does he look like with that stupid black shirt and white tie?  It's like a zoot suit.  He's awful.  Nothing but ugly people on TV.  Oh, see, here's them throwing debris into a jet engine in slow motion to see what it does to the turbine blades.  And, of course, they cut it away before the exciting part of it actually hitting.  The news stinks. 
[01:39:00]  And, again, Jimmy, I was just thinking of how infuriating it is.  They had the logo up for – I was watching Channel 7.  Yeah.  They had the logo up for ABC News, everything, the ticker going.  And they were showing the plane, but then you couldn't see the plane anymore because it was behind the news logo.  All you saw was Jersey and the river, and the plane was gone behind the logo. 
[01:39:30]  And they wonder why people are turning away from television.  It's because you guys suck at your jobs.  You suck at your jobs.  How stupid can you be that you're showing the action and you're just interfering with the picture by putting these giant logos and graphics up?  Nobody reads the news ticker.  Nobody reads it.  No.  Why wouldn't you have a director going, all right, we got it.  Now we're showing something at the bottom of the screen.  Get the logo off immediately.  Get the logo off.  And then we can put it back on when the stupid anchors are on. 
[01:40:00]  When the stupid anchors are talking, put it on.  Put it right across their faces.  They need credit.  They need credit.  We have to get credit.  And they're doing the same thing.  You're not any more special than the other guy.  Brandon in Jersey, was it a crash or a landing, my friend?  It's called a landing for a reason.  And if there's no land involved, it's a crash.  Landing.  Okay.  All right.  You might have ended the bit right there. 
[01:40:30]  It sucks.  Let's go to Spiro.  Spiro.  He's a regular to the show.  What's up, Spiro?  Spiro.  Spiro.  Did you guys hear the sweepers just a few hours after the crash?  How could this crash affect your future flight plans coming up?  Oh, yeah.  I think it would make a bunch of people a little nervous.  A little nervous.  Could a plane crash in your local river?  Douches they are.  Well, let's go to Rob in New York. 
[01:41:00]  He might have a good one.  Rob.  Cool.  Yeah.  I think it's a crash landing when your baggage claim is the Fulton Fish Market.  Yeah.  Good point.  Right.  Yes.  That's a good thing.  Ask the fishmonger for your Samsonite.  Yes.  When you have to get your luggage out of a warehouse somewhere on the Chelsea Pier, it was a crashola.  That's a crashola. 
[01:41:30]  Let's go to Lee in Jersey.  Lee?  Hey, you guys should use the Buffalo Springfield song, Stop Hey What's That Sound, and start  including the crash landing.  Use lyrics from that.  Start mixing it up.  It's pretty funny.  My God.  That's an excellent idea.  Do we have that song?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do we have that song?  All right.  For what it's worth, Buffalo Springfield.  Nice and slow.  Hold on.  You have to walk Danny through this because I'm not exactly sure.  What do you want us to do?  Don't go.  You want us to...  You know, I don't have my own lyrics.  I'm just...  I was just like...  The song popped into my head. 
[01:42:00]  Like, there's something that's happening here.  What is it?  Anything black...  Exactly clear.  Stop Hey Point.  That's a hook.  You stay on the phone.  Stop.  All right.  Yeah.  Maybe Tim can work this out down the hall for us.  Yeah.  Do we have that there?  Are we looking for...  He's looking for it right now.  Yeah, we should have it.  But I hear comedy gold.  All right.  Good.  Oof.  All right.  Hold on a line there.  You're slowing down everybody.  All right.  Here's the song.  Hold on.  There it is.  Now what do we do, sir?  Yeah.  Let's get him back on the line here.  Make up your own lyrics. 
[01:42:30]  Just start, you know, doing what you guys do.  Okay.  Start us out.  Start us out.  Something happened in here.  Start us out.  Start us out, sir.  What it is ain't exactly clear.  There's a man with a gun over there.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Make up our own lyrics.  All right.  Yeah.  Do it.  Hold on.  Wait till the court.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on.  Stop.  I think it's time we stop.  Children.  What's that sound?  A caller who should be killed.  Caller who should be drowned. 
[01:43:00]  There you go.  All right, guys.  All right.  I think it's time we stop taking phone calls.  Steven S. wants to write a song about that guy for what it's worthless.  Someone's bombing right here.  Trying to produce the radio show on the fly.  We have plenty of people here who aren't doing it.  Let's see.  Oof.  What a dumb idea. 
[01:43:30]  Like that need to be said.  Needed to be said.  All right.  Now we got another argument starting.  Will, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hello.  I got a friend of mine.  He works for Southwest.  He's a mechanic.  He told me the technical term was an aquatic landing.  An emergency aquatic landing.  Get out.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  That was another useless one. 
[01:44:00]  Katie Couric had a fine little spin on the whole crash last night on her news program.  To illustrate in a way no words can, watch what the weather did in...  I know.  A little better setup.  So they do the big headline, you know, the landing in the Hudson River, blah, blah, blah.  And instead of going right into their team coverage or whatever, they do this immediately.  To illustrate in a way no words can, watch what the weather did in Mankato, Minnesota.  Meet the frozen banana hammer.  Broke your hammer. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  This was seconds into the broadcast.  They decided...  They still decided to go with the frozen banana hammer bit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Brutal.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve, how are you?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, I don't know if you noticed, every time news guys come out with, like, one of these  big crises, they all have the big, fat logo jackets on, all triple insulated. 
[01:45:00]  They interviewed these shivering survivors.  Not one of them offered their jackets.  You're right.  Like, no coffee, no gloves, no nothing.  Like, tell us about your freezing balls.  That's a good observation.  They kept asking them questions.  Right.  As they're shivering in front of them.  As the guy maybe should have been in somewhere warm.  One guy had a short-sleeved shirt on, and, yeah, they're warm in their jackets.  Very good, man.  Let's go to Drew in Texas.  Drew. 
[01:45:30]  Good morning, boys.  Hello?  If 155 people are standing in the middle of the Hudson River and a boat of some sort is  not involved, that's a crash.  So is that.  Front way, rebound, scored!  No.  No!  Oh, my, I've told you something.  How did that not go in?  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the track.  He leaps at the wall, and it is gone.  Yeah.  It just cleared.  No. 
[01:46:00]  What are they saying now?  They're saying, too, they're saying it's a double.  It went just under the wall.  Oh.  Oh, see, just under.  That's different.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible.  That's just awful.  Aye, aye.  Yeah, this is a very good point from Jay in Rhode Island.  Jay.  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  If you take off and quote-unquote land in the same city, it's a crash.  You know what?  That's a damn good point. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  If you take off and landing are in the same zip code, you crash.  Yeah.  All right.  Is Tim working on a song to wrap up our coverage?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, Tim, lucky us.  Tim's working on a song.  We're going to end the show with a very special song about Miracle on the Hudson. 
[01:47:00]  You're really going to want to stick around for that one.  Your entire flight could have been a 10-minute cab ride.  Tom and Inwood.  Tom.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, it's not a landing if scuba divers are checking the overhead bins for items that were left behind.  That's the truth.  Stay tuned for more of Opie and Anthony's exclusive coverage of Miracle on the Hudson. 
[01:47:30]  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, more exclusive coverage of Miracle on the Hudson.  The listeners are starting to hit some home runs.  Jeff White from Toronto.  If the stowaway in the landing gear door drowns instead of freezes to death, it's a crash.  Chris Hoyt from Cleveland.  If you exit the plane by a slip and slide instead of a jetway, it's a crash. 
[01:48:00]  Ah, yeah, the slip and slide.  Sniper from Wackbag.  If your flight turns into a cruise, it's a crash.  We got Joel in New Jersey.  Joel, what's up?  Gentlemen.  Hey.  James.  Hey, buddy.  Okay.  If at the end of the flight, half the passengers end up in New York and the other in New Jersey,  then you're talking a crash.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Let's go to Paul in New York.  Paul. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  How you doing?  Hey, fellas.  Good.  To crash, if you're a frequent flyer miles, say seven miles for the segment.  Seven miles.  How do they work that out?  They got to give you the miles.  Oh, they got to give you for the whole flight.  I did that joke on stage last night.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I might have said six miles, though.  Yeah.  Well, how'd it do?  Destroyed.  Yeah.  Of course.  Opening line.  Please.  You rule.  Hi.  I'm kind of happy to be here.  I was not supposed to be here.  I was supposed to be in North Carolina.  That will only work once. 
[01:49:00]  Let's go to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin.  Hey, Open Anthony.  Hey, buddy.  Just wanted to say, it's not a landing.  If you make the pilot of your flight an American hero for not killing anyone, I'm bringing the  plane down.  Well, that's true.  The planes land every day, and you don't know who the pilot is.  Has Sully surfaced yet?  I mean, we're too busy doing this show. 
[01:49:30]  I hope so.  Where is he, though?  Oh, you mean I'm like, figuratively speaking.  I thought you meant literally.  Where is he?  Who is he talking to?  He's probably just home with his stewardess wife.  You think he flew right out?  He's like, my job is done here.  He's being debriefed.  He'd be debriefing.  Does he fly again?  Oh, hell yeah.  Or does the airline go, you know what?  You might have a little psychological problem.  I don't care how much experience you got.  We can't have you flying anymore, Sully.  I'm sorry.  Flew an F-4 Phantom. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Guy's a maniac.  That's a good one.  Not in combat.  Kansas City checking in.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey.  Hey.  If you're on National News and you're wearing one of those just ridiculous yellow neck life  vest, it's got to be a crash.  Right.  Yeah.  You know something?  They should have taken those off when they got on land.  They looked really silly last night on the news.  They weren't worried about their appearance at that point.  It just pushes all your neck up into your face. 
[01:50:30]  Those things look very uncomfortable.  We're just going to keep going on the phones because we can't answer them fast enough.  Allen in Missouri, what do you got?  Yeah.  The only real amazing thing about this flight, it was the only thing that was able to crash  land quicker than Voss's act.  Oh.  Bunching out.  Too late.  You're in the river.  Warning track right near the wall.  Leaping.  And he made the catch.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Carlos Beltran right up.  No, he didn't.  My apologies.  I thought he had it.  I thought he had it, too.  He acted as though he had it.  He did not have it.  Yeah, he did not have it.  We got a headline coming in from Chicago.  Crystal.  Yeah, what's bad for the geese is good for the lander.  Boo.  Wow.  That wasn't bad.  Well, you know what?  You should have had a little more confidence.  You were right there.  I hope that phone died because a shotgun blast hit it and her ear. 
[01:51:30]  You suck!  Down goes Razor!  Down goes Razor!  Down goes Razor!  Best sports qualifier, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Do you believe in miracles is a good one?  Was that the Russian hockey team?  Maybe the Russians?  Well, it was for the American hockey team, but yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The Olympics.  You know, the gold medal.  1980.  Miracle on ice, right?  We had a miracle here in New York yesterday.  Yes, on icy water.  Oh. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Uh, what?  Let's say how to problem.  De Niro would have delivered a better joke than stupid David Patterson did.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, you want to hear the Patterson thing again before the De Niro?  Our governor was very happy and excited and wanted to bring the whole city together with  this little, this little thought that he had.  You know, many of you.  Hold on, let me play this for a reference point.  Get ready there, De Niro.  There is an heroic pilot who saved himself and approximately 154 other passengers this afternoon. 
[01:52:30]  We've had a miracle on 34th Street.  I believe now we've had a miracle in the Hudson.  This was potentially a very tragic incident.  This pilot somehow, without any engines, was able to land this plane and perhaps without  any serious injuries to any of the passengers.  All right there, eagle eye.  Yeah.  De Niro, you got something to say to all these New Yorkers listening in? 
[01:53:00]  To the pilot, congratulations, because that was a righteous landing.  Oh, wow.  Working a movie title there.  Working your movie in there, Mr. De Niro.  Get my glasses.  Good thing I didn't have to fight Ray Robinson.  I didn't have to fight Ray Robinson with these.  Yuck.  I think we can all agree the pilot is a good fella. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Are we getting that song?  Yes, sir.  To finish up this side of the show, Tim's been working on a song about the whole miracle  in Hudson.  It's going to be terrific.  Well, I cannot wait.  You're going to want to stick around for that.  Brian in Chicago.  Yeah, it's not a landing if the plane you just exited turns into an aquatic habitat. 
[01:54:00]  And it's not a joke if there's an absence of humor.  Oh, well.  I tried.  All right.  Oh, well.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Oh, boy.  If this is delivered, we got a good one.  Please be delivered right.  Matt, Virginia. 
[01:54:30]  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  If you have to breaststroke to your connecting flight, it is a crash.  Yeah.  Winner.  We got a winner.  Bravo.  He didn't panic under pressure, either.  That was a Sully call right there.  There.  That's funny.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  When a plane needs a sump pump, it's a crash.  Sump pump. 
[01:55:00]  Let's go to John in Smithtown.  John.  Hey, Chad.  If your luggage, if your luggage is still on a plane that's in icy water tethered to Battery Park, it's a crash.  Literal, John.  Yeah, really.  Just describe the scene.  No humor needed.  If the plane is tied up to a pier.  Yeah.  Well.  Yes, it is.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey. 
[01:55:30]  I know we're beating this into the ground, but what the hell.  Paul.  Yeah.  Hey, it's not a landing when your runway makes a splash.  Back then.  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  Has Obama commented on this at all?  Mm-mm.  No?  Why wouldn't he?  That sounds like something.  He wants to stay out of the spotlight.  Let Sully and everybody else have their moment in the, you know, in the icy water.  Sounds like something he would comment on as president-elect. 
[01:56:00]  President-elect.  Big party coming up on Tuesday, huh?  Sure is.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  Now watch that.  Buses are being loaded up, by the way, for huge amounts of people.  Yeah.  That are showing up.  The big trip down to Washington, D.C. 
[01:56:30]  And I hear the news saying stuff like, you know, get on the bus.  They're using the old Spike Lee term.  Oh.  The Million Man March.  They're kind of trying to equate it to that.  So I'm just, I'm waiting.  I wonder how much of it I'll get through on TV before I have to throw something through my television.  How much of what you'll get through?  What?  Inauguration?  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be cool.  Will it?  I think so, yeah.  Yes.  It's probably emotional for people, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Emotional?  For a lot of black people.  Yeah, man.  It's Italian.  See, you just said it, for a lot of black people.  But also white people.  And a lot of white people.  Come on.  What about my president?  He's your president.  Well, well, really?  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  I see a lot of shirts out there that say, not my president.  Well, I don't see him out there.  Because black people would beat you up if you wore that.  Yeah, people are calling it, Pat from Naki, the Deaf Inauguration Jam. 
[01:57:30]  That's what it's going to be.  How am I going to enjoy that?  Would you sit there and watch the BET Awards, the Source Awards?  Then go watch a movie or something.  There's other things to watch.  Yeah, but I have a radio show.  I've got to kind of watch it so I can comment on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Let's go to Stephen Queen.  Steve.  Yeah, it's not a landing.  It's involving you in a hospital bed meeting Mike Bloomberg.  All right, he might have a point. 
[01:58:00]  Someone had a great, you know, Steve line, but I guess they couldn't wait around.  Let's get out of my way.  Get out of my way.  He had a little more to it, but we couldn't get to him to get the full phone call.  Craig, Long Island.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  If your plane comes to rest, say, more than a mile away from the actual runway, you've crashed. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Punch it out.  There's such a fine line between just realism and humor.  Yeah, it's amazing.  That's all really realism is.  It's just kind of you saying what you're stating, and you just take any humor out of it.  Mm-hmm.  See what I just did.  Right.  It's no joke.  It's a statement of fact.  Oh, look, George W.  Yeah.  He gave his speech yesterday, and now they're covering it three hours into the news. 
[01:59:00]  Or Bush.  All right.  Where's our song?  Is it coming?  He's still working on it.  How much time does he need?  Ten.  Ten.  We've got to get out of here in ten minutes.  I know.  Ten?  This was the big ending to our exclusive coverage.  Tell him to give it to us.  I'm finished.  A miracle on the Hudson.  Yeah.  You want it unfinished?  What does he have?  The string section coming in?  Where's he?  Apple Studios?  We told Tim to work on a little song about the whole thing that happened yesterday. 
[01:59:30]  What song is he using?  Do you want to be surprised?  No, let's be surprised.  Really?  You should be surprised.  Yeah, I want to be surprised.  All right.  We'll take a break, and hopefully when we get back, we'll have some form of the song.  Okay?  Yeah, I told him to trim it.  To trim it?  Yeah, trim it.  What song is it?  Rice.  No.  All right.  No, don't tell us.  We'll find out next.  The big song about what happened yesterday.  All right.  Next on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Miracle on the Hudson.  Exclusive coverage by Opie and Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  That's right, Opie and Anthony.  We're going to end this with Tim's song.  We told Tim to work on a song all morning about the miracle on the Hudson.  Yes.  And we're doing what we do best today, run things into the ground.  Yeah.  It's like the old days.  Sure.  People say they like the old shows.  Boy, did we used to do this a lot.  Rob in Atlanta, if they give you goggles and a swim cap instead of headphones and a bag of chips,  it's a crash.  They hand those out. 
[02:00:30]  Let's go to JP on Long Island.  JP.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Tell Roger I said hi.  What do you got?  I just wanted to definitely say that if you have to worry about getting air sick and seasick,  it's definitely a crash.  Good point.  How about this?  When you're coming in and the pilot says, brace for impact.  You crashed.  I never heard that.  It's a nice smooth landing on a runway.  You're right.  Yeah, flight attendants, be seated for arrival, and then the other side is brace for impact. 
[02:01:00]  It's very obvious as to which is a landing and which is nose diving into the frigid water.  I want to point out someone that has the worst timing ever, the amazing Kreskin,  who likes to predict a lot of things.  Yes, he's a mentalist.  He's a hack.  We've had him on the show.  He's a complete hack.  We love messing with him.  He's on Channel 11 News here in New York.  The day after a plane went down in the Hudson River.  Yeah.  Hey, Kreskin. 
[02:01:30]  You're all about predicting things.  You're on the news, and everyone knows you didn't predict one of the biggest events in recent years for New York City.  Yeah.  Well, that's because he's a phony.  Well, the song has come in.  Oh, it's here?  Yeah.  Thank God.  Really fast.  Rob in Connecticut.  Rob.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  It's definitely a crash.  If you don't even have time to open up your little bag of peanuts.  My peanuts. 
[02:02:00]  The bag of peanuts.  Very good.  Well, very exciting morning for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The show wrote itself.  No one wants to talk about anything else today.  And we got a song.  Yes.  Oh, cool.  Asked him to put a little song together to kind of bring our coverage all together.  He ran out of here.  He dropped it off and ran.  He certainly did.  You guys ready for the song, Jimmy?  I am very ready for the song.  I look forward to it.  As John Gielgud said in Arthur, I look forward to it with great eagerness. 
[02:02:30]  If you were here in the metropolitan area on September 11th, you'll probably never look  at a plane flying low again.  And that certainly crosses the minds of everyone who saw that.  We were flying out from LaGuardia to Charlotte.  And about three or four minutes into the flight, the left engine just blew.  I can't stand to fly.  Fire flames coming out of it.  I'm not that naive. 
[02:03:00]  The pilot said, brace for a hard impact.  I'm just out to find.  What was the landing light?  The better part of me.  Scary.  I'm more than a bird.  I'm more than a plane.  I'm more than some pretty face beside a train.  And it's not easy to be me.  Of course, the memories of September 11th, too vivid for too many people who live here  in the tri-state area. 
[02:03:30]  Reviving memories for some of September 11th.  Something is seriously wrong here.  I was here for 9-11.  I was here for a home I'll never see.  It may sound absurd.  But don't be naive.  Even heroes...  Stop it!  The rights of lead are maybe disturbed.  Oh, won't you concede?  Even heroes have the right to dream. 
[02:04:00]  And it's not easy.  Boo!  Blows.  We've had a miracle on 34th Street.  I believe now we've had a miracle on...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  You dick!  Do you think I'm cute, Private Pile? 
[02:04:30]  Do you think I'm funny?  No.  Oh, hi, Tim. 
[02:05:00]  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  That was a quick one.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Iraq, you like Tim's song?  Yeah, especially since it's about how hard it is to be Superman.  This was the perfect song for a plane crash.  Wow.  You told him.  I couldn't think of a song.  And that had plane in it, so I used it. 
[02:05:30]  Is that a comedy song or like a serious one?  I do everything serious.  Damn!  You've just been pwned!  That was good.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Thanks.  I feel like $100 now.  You do know we set you up to fail, right?  Yes.  Okay, good. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  We didn't want no song.  There's no way anyone could come up with a song that's going to be funny, entertaining,  based on this, to any song.  It's just going to sound stupid.  And that's what we wanted you to sound.  Yeah.  Stupid.  We complete your success.  Thank you.  We set you up.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We might want to jump in the river now.  That was a great success.  That was a great success.  The guys want a song about the tragedy.  It's more believable if they say, hey, U.S. Airways would like a goose for the flight. 
[02:06:30]  Let's go to Oakdale.  Oakdale.  Oakdale.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on?  I just want to say, if the Opie and Anthony show spend three hours talking about your flight,  you crash.  That's a good way to end this one today.  Jimmy, heading down to Atlantic City, huh?  I am.  Driving?  Yeah.  Me too.  I might have a flight to Los Angeles, and hopefully they'll just divert. 
[02:07:00]  Take the old goose and engine soiree.  You have some Hudson River water on your jacket, sir.  Pilot, are you, Mr. Grady?  You killed two geese and then crash landed between two states.  I hate to differ with you, sir. 
[02:07:30]  When I realized I couldn't make it back to LaGuardia, my flight pan had to be corrected.  As I know, I said flight pan.  That's all right.  Maybe you were frying something as well.  I was, yeah, tonight, the show's tonight, tomorrow was sold out, but Sunday still has, I think still has tickets.  And they might be, check for tonight, tomorrow if you want, because I have comps that I don't use.  Can I get a seat?  Probably.  Yes.  They will.  If I like to Charlotte, I'd love to book you on it. 
[02:08:00]  They release tickets, so there might be some really good tickets available for tonight and tomorrow.  Yeah, can I use one of my comps and all.  Yeah, right on.  They're short for complimentary tickets.  And the next Wednesday, I'm actually in Miami doing the Miami Comedy Festival.  We have a great, I'm so psyched that Monday coming in, we have Fedor.  Fedor.  We have the Russian heavyweight.  He's an animal.  Best heavyweight in the world.  All right, we're going to leave, they're going to start their music marathon here in New York.  It's a whole 92 minutes of songs. 
[02:08:30]  About planes?  Planes and crashing and stuff.  Learning to fly.  Yeah, they put together a fine music marathon for everybody.  Leaving on a jet plane?  All that stuff in honor of the miracle on the Hudson.  They really worked overtime to make this music marathon make sense.  Buddy Holly and Big Bopper songs?  Sure.  Might be a couple hero songs in there just to kind of make it a little special.  All right.  Yeah, they worked really hard on this one.  Many, many hours.  So I want you to stick around and show your appreciation for the hard work being done here at this rock station in New York. 
[02:09:00]  Music marathon time with plane and hero songs.  What's the first song, by the way?  You want the truth or?  Yeah, the truth.  Foo Fighters' Monkey Wrench.  There you go.  See?  There you go.  See?  Very clever.  Yes, because.  You don't want every song to be, you know, right in your face.  It's obvious.  Monkey Wrench, you know.  Think about it.  What's the second song? 
[02:09:30]  Plane on the Hudson.  It's a good one.  Then we have Time from Pink Floyd.  Time, see?  See?  Perfect.  Time, Monkey Wrench.  Just think about it.  Think about it.  This Mark Chernoff is a, he's a program, he's a genius when it comes to programming rock radio.  What's the third song in the music marathon that has everything to do with flying and being a hero?  Guns N' Roses, I Used to Love Her.  See?  That's right.  Unbelievable.  But I had to drown her.  And then he booked her on that flight. 
[02:10:00]  That's what that means.  Sometimes you gotta, like, you know, read between the lines.  That's the brilliance of Mark Chernoff and his music marathons here in New York.  Are they playing Crazy Train?  That's the alternative.  Yeah.  To get to Charlotte.  What's the next song there, Danny?  Then we'll have a little no rain from Blind Melon.  It was perfect flying weather yesterday.  This Mark Chernoff, my God, they don't pay him enough.  And the plane landed in that puddle that rotten little kid was jumping in.  Right.  See?  In the video, if you remember.  Of course. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, Blind Melon.  I thought it was something Governor.  Blind Governor.  Nice.  And one more.  Stupid Patterson.  They have a YMCA looking at the pool.  And, you know, here, you see people diving and doing cannonballs.  A passenger's apparently jumping off the wing.  Yippee!  Lifeguards.  This stupid idiot he is. 
[02:11:00]  I didn't realize there was a locker room here.  She's Governor Bat.  How does he know it was a miracle?  Come on.  Of course.  He sleeps upside down.  That's a miracle.  One more.  Then after that, it's going to be Dave Matthews' band Crash Into Me.  No, I'm kidding.  That's a joke.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  What is it?  It's the themes.  I'll let the bodies hit the floor.  No, I'm joking.  Oh.  You think the governor gets upset when he's at those political meetings and they say,  okay, the eyes have it. 
[02:11:30]  No, they don't.  Have what?  Have a deformity?  Then he goes, you bet they do.  Let's land into the water safely and get the F out of here.  Yes.  I know.  It's amazing how we were doing so good.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden, we're Swiss air over Canada.  Good plane tie-in, Jim.  If you're not joining us for the rest of the show, you guys have a good weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, I see a big crowd outside the studio. 
[02:12:00]  It must be Friday.  Friday's the day to see the Opie and Anthony Show.  There it is.  Yeah, that's our big day.  Yeah.  For the studio audience.  Tuesday sucks.  It's usually one or two people out there.  Yeah.  Very depressing.  But Fridays, you get a nice crowd.  And I didn't forget, I brought my change in for Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  It's heavy, too.  Oh, wow.  I forgot.  And, uh...  I didn't care.  So I didn't bring any. 
[02:12:30]  That's funny.  How about like Olivier in the Marathon Man?  She can only take home what she can swallow.  Well, we can't just hand the change over to Patty.  No.  So we're trying to figure out what to do with the change and Patty.  I already got an answer.  What do you got?  We open our asshole and dump in what she can take.  Nice.  Oh.  That would be insertion, you know.  That would be great.  No.  Just drop them in.  From altitude.  How about you close the lid and tape it shut, and then we throw it at her face, and she 
[02:13:00]  has to catch it in her teeth.  That's just my ideas.  Her chiclets.  I wanted to just like toss all of this on the very cold sidewalk and make her like crawl  around and pick it up.  In our underwear.  That's the best I got so far.  Well, we don't want the hypothermia thing.  What's hypothermia?  Huh?  I said you can't get it unless you're in water.  Yeah.  Anyone have an idea?  Can you get hypothermia if you don't live in an icebox?  Anyone have an idea for the change bit?  Anybody? 
[02:13:30]  Danny, you got an idea yet?  You're a good idea, man.  Some listeners brought their own change, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How's that guy from the Renaissance period?  Jesus.  Brought in a little fucking pouch.  How about put the spray on the money?  What, Danny?  I put the spray on the money.  Yeah, the liquid ass?  No.  So tired of that liquid ass.  Yeah, I have to agree.  Oh, it stinks.  We thought about the liquid ass thing.  Wow.  Really?  Wow.  I think it's all quarters, though.  Oh, it is?  I'll keep that.  Someone has a flip camera, I guess.  What? 
[02:14:00]  It looks like a flip camera pouch.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the battery's born in the 1400s.  He's trying the same joke again.  Oof.  Bomb.  Anyone have an idea for the change bit?  Pat, do you have an idea?  Just give it to me.  I mean, Brooksy.  Brooksy.  They used to call you Brooksy in school.  Childhood name.  Childhood name.  Ronnie was doing a...  That was stupid.  No, Ronnie was doing a bit.  It's like, you know, what name did they call you in school, which was, you know, 
[02:14:30]  mortifying, right?  And Patty goes, well, they used to call me Brooksy.  That's not a bad school nickname.  Well, that's...  You didn't get the bit.  The only thing...  I don't know.  Last year, we had a roll in honey.  We had to put honey on ourselves and roll in money or something.  That's the...  Yeah, it was called money, honey.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  Figure it out.  I don't know, but that's what I...  That's the only...  But that's what I've done.  Come on.  We got some very clever listeners. 
[02:15:00]  We got a clever staff, or some of the staff is clever.  Can we stand at the exhaust end of a jet engine and throw the change in the front?  Who gave this change?  That's one of our new interns.  He brought in his...  Oh, fuck.  I'm keeping this one, too.  ...his bag change as well.  And I'm going to make money off this bit.  All right, we got a lot of change.  It's change day on the Opie and Anthony show, and we don't have an idea yet.  How about bobbing for change?  Oh.  Oh, bobbing for change.  Yeah.  Get some icy water, and she has to get her head all the way to the bottom. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, and just dig him out.  I don't keep change.  So I'm saying cover her ass in double-sided tape and make her kind of squat and pick  up as much as she can.  She really needs the money, too.  That is good.  Oh, boy, does she work.  How about this?  I'll put a 20 on my fist and then just punch her with it.  Watch that. 
[02:16:00]  Phil, well, Mike in Baton Rouge.  Mike writes, fill a bucket with shit and have Patty pick through.  I threw it for her change.  Yeah, it's a good one.  That'll get past the lawyers.  Are we allowed to, like, cover her ass in peanut butter and then have her sit down on  the change?  Have a German shepherd give her the change?  I would gather without any insertion.  Yeah, that'd be fine.  Do we have peanut butter? 
[02:16:30]  We can get some.  That's easy.  All right.  No more plain jokes, by the way.  We were calling it in for those other fuckers.  We'll do some real stuff over here.  Yeah.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, I got a little idea.  How about you douse Patty in maple syrup, put all the change on the tarp on the floor.  She has to roll around and all the change and all the change at six to her, she gets  the key.  I have a better idea.  How about, how cold is it out right now?  It's about 12 degrees probably.  How about this?  We put her in her underpants, we throw water on her and make her stand outside, and then 
[02:17:00]  we drop the change in the thing from the fifth floor and make her catch it, and it lands  on her foot.  Ow.  Yeah.  That might hurt.  Exactly.  As bad as that joke did, tell him it.  Yeah, let's go to Bill in Charleston.  Bill!  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I got an idea.  We could put it all in a sock and beat her with it.  Let's go to David in Kansas City.  What's going on?  I'm learning there's not a lot of Patty fans out there. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, I don't remember what Western it was, but one of them, they used to put all the  dimes in his shotgun.  Oh, that was the good, the bad, and the retarded.  What, sir?  I said that in that one Western with Christian Bale in it, I can't remember which one it  was, they'd load all the dimes in his shotgun barrel and shoot him at people.  Oh, was that Batman?  No, not Batman.  No, no, no.  Give her some dimes, Joker.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Load up a shotgun with dimes and shoot her with it. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah, that'll work.  Would the lawyers allow that?  Oh, of course, yeah, yeah.  After five minutes with it, they would.  Do we have the unedited version of your phone call from last night?  I think it was just one curse.  I mean, it wasn't that big.  Because this is XM.  Well, they're asking for the phone call one more time.  One more time.  Because a lot of people were concerned that Jimmy might have been on a flight yesterday.  Well, people thought that I might have been hurt because they know that I live there.  And the first thing everybody thinks of when something like that happens is, like, is  Jim okay?  Right. 
[02:18:30]  I understand.  Of course.  Very important to people, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm a bit of a megalomaniac.  Someone's suggesting, how about you guys just give her the change and don't do anything  on air with her?  She's never funny, and you guys just can't seem to realize that.  Who's that?  That was instant feedback from God.  I thought her discussion yesterday was quite enjoyable, learning that she's collected seven  hours of vacation time.  Seven hours of vacation.  After working for Starbucks for two years.  And then she grabbed my cock the way hungry, hungry hippo grabs a marble. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  Yeah, not very sensitive.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  On her own, she's not funny or entertaining, but we kind of make something out of it.  What if we play some kind of variation of cherry darts?  Like, where we could get, like, tape and we could get, like, double-sided tape, cover  her ass in it, and maybe there's point values, and we could throw the change at her.  And, you know, if it sticks, she gets to keep it, but then there's, like, zones.  And if you get, like, you know, a bullseye, it's worth, like, four times as much or 
[02:19:30]  whatever.  Or ten times, whatever.  We'd need double-sided tape.  That's easy, though.  Or peanut butter.  I'm really good at fleas.  I almost took out Jimmy's eye.  Jimmy Norton.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You hit me with this penny.  He's got a show to do.  Yes, he does.  Three.  Doing them all tonight.  Let's go to Tom in Virginia.  Get him out of the way.  Tom?  Hello, Tom.  You're out, Tom.  Good, what's up?  Yeah, maybe I could help.  Hey, why don't you get her on all fours? 
[02:20:00]  Get her naked, and you'd stack all the coins while you do the show, and whatever doesn't  fall off, she gets to keep.  Let's stack the coins on her.  Oh.  Um.  Hmm.  No, because it would just, somebody, just one thing she would do, and she'd go, and she'd  drop them.  It'd be awful.  Whatever noise she'd make.  There's got to be something she could do for the change.  Anybody have an idea out there?  Like a real one?  Oh, please.  I guess we could stick roaches in the bag with the money. 
[02:20:30]  This fucking kid has actually a couple of good ideas.  It's just, we don't prepare.  That's actually a great idea.  If we had any preparation, that would be a great idea to do.  Yeah.  Because the roaches, and the roaches would be thinking that we're giving them the money,  and they have to survive her dopey hands.  Do they clean up the roach problem around here?  You really just open the fridge.  Can we get some, uh, some kind of live thing?  Kind of, not in this weather.  Can't even go outside and turn over a rock. 
[02:21:00]  Find a cootie bug.  All right, here's Jim's voicemail, because a lot of people were very concerned about  a little Jimmy yesterday.  And watch how it peters out at the end.  This is why I should be shot in the fucking mouth with a cock.  I just wanted to let everybody know, it's Jim.  I'm okay.  I know that everybody's been wondering about me.  There's a few ways.  There's a airways crash here in New York.  I know you're wondering if I'm okay.  I'm fine. 
[02:21:30]  I wasn't on the plane.  I don't fly U.S. Airways.  I also don't fly to LaGuardia.  But I live on the west side, right by the water, 20 blocks from where the plane went down.  And I wasn't outside what would have happened.  I was in my apartment.  And approximately the time it happened, I was balls deep in a girl's hiney.  So I was having anal sex.  And just thinking, if that plane had tried to get back to LaGuardia and made a left and banged,  it could have hit my building and killed me.  And that's how I would have died.  Oh, it's my penis in a girl's hiney.  But I'm okay right now. 
[02:22:00]  And I just want everybody to know that I'm okay.  And I'm going to be fine.  Boo.  That's Peter right out.  That was the best example.  In the dictionary under the word fizzle, they have a link to that fucking call.  I liked it.  I liked it, too, until I realized I had nowhere to go with it.  And I'm going to be...  I just said, fine.  Fucking stink.  Way to not plan anything out.  Fucking fart tits.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys? 
[02:22:30]  Hey, we can keep with the Obama thing and have Patty read an Obama speech.  Every time she says the word change, we just start hauling change at her.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Now, see, the bit's starting to...  I'll start throwing it at her.  ...starting to develop a little bit.  You get the Obama change speech.  Every time Patty says the word change, we get to throw a handful of change at her.  Of course, she would have to be completely nude, so she's completely humiliated.  Of course.  I didn't have to say that.  It's obvious.  Or is there a good change song?  Money. 
[02:23:00]  Ch-ch-ch-changes.  Oh, yeah.  Changes.  Changes by Black Sabbath.  When it's time to change, the Brady Bunch.  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.  Come on.  I know we could develop this in front of everyone's eyes.  That's what we're doing today.  Obama change speech.  Watch, boys.  I'm out of here.  All right.  We're on to something.  Change.  Yeah.  Dad punches another hole into his belt.  Let's go to Tony in Canada. 
[02:23:30]  Tony.  Yes.  Thanks for your geese, fucko.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we had to do something, eh?  Yeah.  That's better than Bush.  When he got in, they dropped two towers.  Obama's getting in.  He's just getting the plane.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's from Canada.  What do you expect?  Okay.  That makes perfect sense.  What if maybe we have a participant from the audience go shirtless? 
[02:24:00]  We put the change on our shirtless audience member and then double-sided tape on Patty's  buttocks or maybe some other regions, and she has to pick the change up off of said member.  Off of somebody.  Mm-hmm.  Or not.  We don't have to do that.  No.  How about Patty's a virgin?  How about she has to fuck at least two of the security guys if we give her the change?  Oh, my God.  I know we can figure this out.  We're kind of like, we're getting there.  See, we're getting there. 
[02:24:30]  The creative process at work.  Well, maybe we can see if Patty has any ideas.  She's usually an idea person.  Oh, her improv and ideas are fantastic.  Should we at least bring her in for a second to ask you, Pat?  I think we should.  She went to the bathroom.  Did she really?  Okay.  Yeah, why would she stay on the bleachers when we're talking about her?  When we're talking about her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She could have pissed before or during a break or something, but no.  Well, a lot of ideas coming in, but we're waiting for the phones to be answered. 
[02:25:00]  With that pissy sound going into the toilet.  No, she's probably taking those awful diarrhea fart shits.  She pushes and it goes.  You have good bowel movements, Patty?  Yeah, but I had to pay.  I was just wondering if you had good bowel movements.  I do.  Patty, look at all the change.  I could pay some bills.  That's a lot of money.  What do you want to do for the change, Patty?  What's your idea? 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  The worst thing I could think of was that honey bit two years ago.  The honey bit.  I'll never forget that.  If I had to take a shower last week, I had to take three with that.  What?  Yeah, because everything stuck to me.  We have a silly mask.  A silly mask?  Because we can just make this more of a visual.  We go outside.  Have her take the one she's wearing on.  Exactly.  Do we have a mask?  What do we got? 
[02:26:00]  I'm sure we have stuff here, and if not, I know that we have stuff at the other joint.  Patty, take the Skeletor mask off.  I say...  Nothing on that?  All right.  I like that.  Oh, the audience boos.  I'll accept their judgment.  They boo with delight.  They certainly do.  Patty, we might put the horse mask on you.  The horse head.  Yes.  And then we might just toss this change on the sidewalk.  It's very busy out there right now, and you have to pick it all up.  And then we'll do our stupid radio show.  The horse mask. 
[02:26:30]  With the horse mask on you.  Where's the horse mask?  I think that's over with you.  Can we go get that?  That's funny.  I think we have other options here.  Yeah?  We may.  I'll go take a look.  I'm pretty sure we do.  What?  Better...  No, well, I mean...  Someone get the horse mask immediately.  We got like 10 interns.  Get that.  And let's see what Danny comes up with in the back room.  The horse mask.  The only thing is, I got to dress warmly because I have medical issues, and hypothermia could  put me in the hospital. 
[02:27:00]  Did she just...  Could it?  Did she say typothermia?  Hypothermia.  Oh, you have a really weird medical issue where hypothermia is bad for you?  I have asthma.  Oh, my God.  How did you catch that?  What an oddity.  I have a heart condition.  And she laughs.  Exactly.  And kicks her foot up.  What?  With whimsy.  Oh, the bunny mask.  The bunny mask.  I like the bunny mask.  Yeah, I do like the bunny mask.  The horse mask is ridiculous.  Yeah, the horse mask is humiliating.  It's really bad.  Where's the piggy mask, though?  Hold on, Patty.  Could you put this mask on? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  The pig mask.  Yeah, I want to blow someone in the pig mask with this.  I don't know that.  All right.  Put the bunny mask on.  All right.  There you go.  Now, could you go on 57th Street and hop in front of a bus?  That almost looks too cute.  I like the horse mask better.  The horse mask looks so ridiculous.  What's the pig mask?  It's on its way?  Okay.  Do we have the pig mask?  I don't remember having a pig mask.  Yeah, for fatty pig fatty. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't seen that in a very long time.  Do we have a goose mask and an A300?  What's an A300?  It's a plain dummy.  Exactly.  How do you not know anything about aeronautics?  I don't.  It's only been on the news the whole day.  Yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, what do you think about the big miracle on the Hudson there, Patty?  I'm glad everybody got out.  They didn't all get out.  You know them? 
[02:28:30]  No.  I don't know anybody.  Then why are you glad?  I'm glad they got out.  Nope.  There were no fatalities.  Other than our radio audience during this bit.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  Put humor.  Rest in peace.  Yeah.  Humor, we hardly knew you.  Oh, Patty.  How do you think we should...  Patty, what do you think we should do to give you the money?  We can't just hand it to you. 
[02:29:00]  When you're talking about making a speech or something, Obama tends to say a few words  over and over again, like...  Change.  Change.  So do I when I'm talking about them.  What?  Jesus, Patty.  You are about useless.  I have no idea what to do with change in Patty.  That doesn't entail hurting her. 
[02:29:30]  No.  I'm not saying we do it.  I'm just saying I can't come up with an idea.  I think the horse mask, the sidewalk, we throw it on the sidewalk.  Now she has to pick up all this change in this cold weather in front of people.  Let that happen.  We do a radio show and we move on.  It is cold out, though.  So?  Do you have gloves today?  I have everything.  Pick up change on the sidewalk with gloves.  It'll take a while.  No kidding.  Is it possible she can put on the horse mask and walk up to people and every time she has 
[02:30:00]  to walk up and go, hi, I'm Patty and I'm a stupid horse?  How about hi, I'm a horse?  Ah, all right.  Holy shit.  And then what?  And then we put you on a real horse and give you a Christopher Reeve mask and hope for the  best.  Hi, I'm a horse.  It's hi, I'm a hog, Patty.  We treat you like that horse that, oh, fuck, now I can't remember the horse's name.  Which horse?  Ardoon? 
[02:30:30]  No, the one that, okay, Ardoon would be a good one.  I was thinking the one that they put the tent up around on the track.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, oh, no, no.  Yeah, Barbarossa.  No, Barbaro actually lasted for a while on its hoof, the paw, the hoof, the paw, what  is that?  It's a sin, man.  How about one of us puts on a horse mask and treats her like a guy in Seattle?  All right, we'll take a quick break.  Why don't these survivors go home? 
[02:31:00]  What?  Why don't these survivor guys go home?  I've had enough of this one guy who's like the face of the plane crash victims.  Yeah.  I'm tired of him and his thin lips and his fucking stupid hairdo.  Giovanni Ribisi of the air.  He's bugged me.  He got brand new clothes for his big interview on MSNBC, huh?  Exactly, with his big shitty ears.  That's probably what happened.  The wind resistance was cut down by his fucking big shitty flap ears.  He's pointing himself out on the wing like a class picture.  Yeah, I'm right there.  Yeah, this is me doing nothing but being rescued like the helpless fucking fawn that I was. 
[02:31:30]  All of a sudden, he's Mr. Big Shot.  Where were you when the fuck on the wing?  You stood there like every one of the other slobs.  Those brand new jeans.  Who's the fucking hole?  I think that's probably his wife or something, huh?  Oh.  He's bringing her over.  Oh.  Oh, she looks good.  Is she pregnant?  I'm sure another survivor.  That's a survivor.  Is it?  Yeah.  I think so.  Are you going to bring her over?  A little bunt?  Yeah.  Yeah, she does have a little bunt on her there.  So what did you do when the plane went down? 
[02:32:00]  I ate 40 cushions.  All right.  Now this guy's mad that she's there yapping.  He's trying to get his side in again.  Yeah, taking up his spotlight.  He's like, look, I thought we were going to die.  I jammed three fingers in it.  What do I know?  What do I know?  That's what I always said I would do.  Yeah, that's what everybody says.  I'd just grab the nearest chick and start fucking her.  I'm lucky my dick stays hard under ideal conditions in a hotel.  Yeah, on a crashing plane. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, as everyone's bracing for impact, my penis would wilt.  All right.  The graph with the giant plane flying over where the wings touch both sides of Jersey and New York.  It's a new bridge.  Exactly.  Halfway through, you're in the cabin.  That's a fucking, that's a huge plane they show in the graphics.  The graphic is horrible.  All 27,000 passengers survived.  I apologize.  It's not built to scale.  Miracle on the aircraft bird strikes. 
[02:33:00]  In 2007, there was 7,600.  Wow.  They're becoming a problem.  They're counting cars and bikes and skateboards and everything.  Everything.  Yeah.  Now what is the news saying?  We're not going to cut Patty's hair.  That's a bad change.  We've done that.  And Patty would call the authorities at this point, right, Patty?  Oh, I'd probably die.  Shut up.  What's interesting about you is you used to be into things like that. 
[02:33:30]  Like the cutting the hair, the weird things.  And you wouldn't do anything sexual.  Now you're like a sexual monster.  Yeah.  You're touching cock.  You're fucking, you know, getting naked.  You're letting people diddle you.  You're putting fucking vibrators up your pussy.  You're doing all kinds of stuff.  You had a finger in your bum.  You had a finger in your bum.  My finger.  Remember that?  Jimmy's finger.  We were allowed to do that, remember?  It was in your bum.  One in your bum and one in your slit.  Bum.  And then you grab my penis.  Yeah.  The way a trap closes around the leg of a fucking, of a mink. 
[02:34:00]  Probably made up for lost time.  Jimmy had to chew his dick off to get your hand away from him.  All right.  The horse mask has arrived.  Let's at least look at the horse mask.  Oh, that's great.  Let's put the horse mask on, Patty.  Patty.  There you go.  Why are you doing that, me?  I'm starting to think that Danny doesn't like Patty.  No, it's just funny.  She puts it on and goes from the back to the front.  See, I was insinuating she was a horse's ass. 
[02:34:30]  And now she's, oh, fuck.  Can you see, Patty?  What?  I'm like, it's all dented.  Can you see?  Yeah.  Exactly.  It looks like a horse with AIDS.  Yeah.  It's a horrible horse.  Yeah.  Who sat on the horse head?  The horse is dented.  Its nose is dented.  To be fair, I think it's been sitting around the office for about two and a half years.  Oh, really?  That might be why.  There it is.  Pull out that horse's cheek.  There you go, Patty.  Dude, I just say this really loud. 
[02:35:00]  Hi, I'm Patty, and I'm a stupid horse.  Hi, I'm Patty, and I'm a stupid horse.  Now say that while running full speed at the window.  No.  She looks like the baby in Eraserhead.  Without the mask.  Yeah.  That was before she put the mask on.  That mask looks so silly.  It is a silly, silly mask.  Is it getting hot in there, Patty?  You'll steam it up?  No, it just feels weird. 
[02:35:30]  I've never worn a horse's head before.  Well, who has, Patty?  Really?  I don't think you have to really say that.  I like the tough to fuck.  I like, look like the horse is wearing Pacino's wig.  Yeah.  Gotta get lifts from the hooves.  Yeah.  Thick horseshoes.  Horseshoes.  What's the matter there, Patty?  You don't, uh...  Oh, my God.  Got no idea?  She's wearing a horse mask?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  It's very strange, uh, acting like a horse.  You're not acting like a horse.  You're not acting like a horse.  You have a stupid horse mask on.  Gallop around the room for a minute.  Gallop?  Gallop.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Why is she doing that?  Palsy horse.  Shit.  Don't I just kidding.  She needs to be put down.  Should we just throw it on the sidewalk and then move on with the show?  Literally.  Five floors out the window. 
[02:36:30]  Speaking of that, goddamn, that fucking, uh, what's his name?  Patrick McGowan?  He died the same day, uh...  What's his name?  He just died.  Montalban.  Yeah, I think he was.  Yeah, Ricardo Montalban.  But my favorite was in Braveheart when his gay son had his gay lover, and he was like  his advisor to the military, and he walked into the, uh, room and, uh, asked his son's  gay lover what he thought about the situation as he put his arm around him and guided him 
[02:37:00]  toward the window, and then just heaved him out of the fucking window.  Best scene ever in a movie.  I don't remember that part.  Oh, it's fantastic.  How high up were they?  Oh, real high up.  The guy just fucking splattered on the ground.  I, um, if he's the same guy I'm thinking of, is he the one from Escape from Alcatraz as  the warden?  I think it's the warden.  I love, no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.  He's got his fucking the greatest clip speech.  He's now dead.  He's dead.  Poor Doc.  He just wanted to paint. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Took his painting supplies away.  Yeah.  Because he didn't like the picture of him.  I love that picture of him.  His eyes roll wide.  His eyes roll wide.  I'm the warden.  I'm watching.  Ah, right.  All right, Patty.  I think we might just throw this on the sidewalk and move on with the show, and I'll maybe get  a little video or something.  Because I don't know what else to do with it.  I don't know.  I have no idea what to do with you and change.  You're going to cut your legs off.  Something.  What, Patty?  I guess the sidewalk. 
[02:38:00]  With the horse mask on?  I guess so.  Or we could see how much change you could, like, you know, put in your panties.  What kind of panties do you got on there?  In the back.  It looked like a big load of shit.  I love the Anthony panties.  Oh, one of your three pair, right?  Let me see your panties.  Come on, horsey.  Let's see your panties.  Maybe we pour the change into your panties, and you try to keep as much as you can in  your panties.  How about this?  I know that the stink stuff we've used a lot of, but I wish there was something that 
[02:38:30]  we could dump that stink stuff into, and then put the change in there, and make her  rifle through that, so she has to get the stink stuff all over her hands and all over  the change.  We wouldn't want to smell it, but they wouldn't.  No, I know.  Yeah, the audience is begging for it.  They're begging for it.  They would like it a lot.  At this point, then she'd have to have that stuff all over her hands and the change in  her pocket.  Ew.  Yeah, but, no.  Ew.  I think the honey was worse, though, because I had to take three showers with that. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, we heard.  Yeah.  How many showers did you have to the honey?  About two or three to get it all out.  It's amazing how she just changed the number.  It was so sticky, and it wasn't just honey.  It was maple syrup, too.  Well, you didn't even shower after that, did you?  Well, I had to go home.  Why didn't you shower?  How many showers did you take?  Yeah, you should.  And I actually had to take the train that way with everything sticking to me, and I was  like, oh my God, oh my God.  You should have showered. 
[02:39:30]  Why didn't you shower when you got home?  I did.  Once?  Two or three times.  I think I thought of something.  We could still do the street thing.  Yeah.  You know how there's usually, and I hope he's there, but usually there's a filthy, disgusting  bum.  Yes.  Well, what if the change happened to spill out, and then her and the bum have to find out  that change?  And she, of course, has the disadvantage, but she's wearing the horse mask.  Yeah.  And I'm sure she'll be quite intimidated by scary, smelly, homeless guys. 
[02:40:00]  By a homeless, bummy guy.  I'm afraid of those people.  Some of them are nuts.  Well, we'll see how much you want your bills paid, because that's what we're going to do,  I think.  That is a good one.  Can we get the cross-dressing bum, too?  Is he out there?  Oh, that's just a mean motherfucker.  That thing.  Oh, boy.  Where is he?  Fucking Harry Dean Stanton in a sexy wig.  What a creep that guy is.  Harry Dean Stanton.  Maybe we could give you, like, a maple syrup, like, hair washing, and then you use your 
[02:40:30]  hair to pick up the change.  There's a lot of it.  Oh, sticky.  But we just handed the change.  Yeah, at this point.  Fuck.  Roll it up and duct tape and throw it at her.  Are you hitting her with it?  I hit her right square in the head.  Patty, you have head protection on. 
[02:41:00]  What are you covering?  You have a horse mask.  What are you afraid of?  Patty, what are you scared of?  Oh, I hope he's quite the marksman with that, uh...  Oh, come on.  Look on the change.  I'm fearful of a bum shot.  He's flipping...  Flicking the change at her.  I got it. 
[02:41:30]  And she's trying to dodge it.  It's hard because I can't see too well.  That's because you're wearing a protective horsey mask that won't hurt if you get hit  with a penny with it.  Why are you covering with your hands?  He's not flicking balling balls.  What are you covering?  I don't know, but it's weird.  You're weird.  Cool.  Leonard Lawrence has entered the studio.  I can't get out of the way in time.  It's just a penny being flicked at you.  Why don't we just hand it to her? 
[02:42:00]  Tell her to put it in her pockets.  Yeah, move on.  All right.  We'll take a break and move on with the show.  It's change day.  Patty gets mine and a few other people's change today.  Dude, I probably have $200 worth of change in my house.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't save change.  Whenever I get it, I leave it in whatever store I'm in. 
[02:42:30]  And you know why?  The iPhone.  Because I've got to put my iPhone in a pocket, and if I put change in the same pocket, it  scratches it up.  You realize that's how much it's worth?  Yeah.  Piece of shit that is.  It scratches it up.  Oh, cool.  So I just take my change, and I'll leave it somewhere where some little kid will grab  it and go, ooh, I could buy some candy.  I'm wearing your pants.  I'm going to fuck them.  What you ought to do.  Just leave the change in your pocket, and then when you have to make a call, put the 
[02:43:00]  iPhone on one ear and the change on the other, and notice the exact same thing happening.  All right.  We'll figure it out after the break.  Right.  All right.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is not what I'm used to.  Here it is, live.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson, uh-uh.  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy. 
[02:43:30]  Malarkey.  Piney.  Cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh!  Ah!  But boy, they sure did.

Oh, following the success of their initial MMA event, Affliction Entertainment returns with Affliction M1 Global, Day of Reckoning, live on pay-per-view, Saturday, January 24th at 9 p.m., 6 p.m. Pacific. 
[02:45:30]  The explosive six-fight MMA pay-per-view event will be headlined by Russian sensation Fedor Emelianenko.  As he attempts to defend his world alliance of mixed martial arts, heavyweight belt against world top-ranked heavyweight.  Andre the Pitbull Arlowski.  The blockbuster pay-per-view also features MMA all-star. 
[02:46:00]  James Parnass.  As he takes on the experience.  Gilbert Ivelle.  Other fighters featured on the card include Matt Tala Lin-Lin, Renata Babalus-Abrail, Chris Hederecki, and Dan Lazan.  The event is presented by Global Boy Promotions, starring Donald J. Trump.  Tato!  Yeah, yeah.  Emilianenko!  That's what we have coming in Monday, by the way.  Yes, we do.  I'm very psyched.  You're coming back just for that, right, Jimmy?  I am coming back just for that.  Again, that fight between him and Arlovski should be a great fight. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I think he's the best heavyweight in the world.  We're looking forward to this.  Big time.  Affliction, M1 Global, Day of Reckoning, live on Pay-Per-View, Saturday, January 24th at 9 p.m., 6 p.m. Pacific.  Contact your Pay-Per-View provider to order.  All right.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're in a quandary with this change stalker patty bit.  I got it.  We're pretty much going to give up on it, obviously, but...  I got it, Opie. 
[02:47:00]  What do you got?  We hand her the change, and she has to hold it, and they put a firecracker on her clit.  I like it.  See, that's the shit I like with patty.  A little less clay pool.  There's a plane in the water.  What happened?  Is this Primus or one of his side projects?  No, no, this is Primus.  This is all pork soda.  It's called DMV.  Oh.  Do you like Primus? 
[02:47:30]  I love Primus.  Do you?  Really?  Yeah, I never got a chance to see him either, so I'm really pissed.  Aren't they still playing or no?  No, it's like Les is doing his own thing.  Like, sometimes he'll be with some of the guys, sometimes he'll be with some other guys.  It's okay, because it all sounds like this when it's Les.  It does, but...  I had a chance to see him, and I could have went to Metallica one night and then Primus the  next night, and instead I chose to see Metallica twice in a row.  You should have.  It's all right.  It's not like you fucking went to the Carpenters.  Yeah.  Like you saw Little Anthony and the Imperials go fucking Ritz somewhere.  Hey, um... 
[02:48:00]  Great show.  What a performer.  Yeah.  That was wonderful.  Tears on his pillow.  Your lips to God's ears.  John Velvie had a funny cover that I was like, tears on my pillow, stains on my sheets,  la, la, la.  La, la, la.  What was the goof line, though?  Stains on my sheets.  Oh, the stains.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there was more to it.  American Life's a good song, I promise.  It is, actually.  I've used that one before for things.  All right.  Burn, burn, burn, burn.  Secret show.  Right.  What? 
[02:48:30]  Secret show when?  No, nothing.  I just used that song as part of the introduction.  During the secret show.  I see.  All right, Patty, would you want to just grab your change?  I'm very disappointed in the fact that we couldn't come up with at least something.  Well, it was sort of impulsive yesterday.  And, you know, then with the plane crash, it wasn't really one of those big, although  the water landing, as I like to call it, it wasn't really a top priority to come up 
[02:49:00]  with it.  No, no.  Here's the difference.  What?  Yes.  If we have change, and we hand it to Patty, that bit crashed.  Yeah, well, where is the fucking idiot?  Patty, still sitting there with the horse mask on, on the bleachers.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty. 
[02:49:30]  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Here goes Patty again.  Oh, my God.  She can't even walk with it on.  She's walking like our governor.  I guess.  That, too.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  We go back to you in the horse mask.  Nah, you're broke.  We all know this.  You owe money to your fucking cable bill, right? 
[02:50:00]  Your phone, your rent, everything else.  How much rent do you pay a month?  Well, now I reduced it to $419,000 because I went and got recertified.  Recertified as what?  For Section 8.  You have to approve your income $2,000 a year.  What are you, Clinger?  It's too crazy to fucking be in a regular house.  How do you learn about this stuff?  Yeah, you did your research on fucking glomming off of fucking society, didn't you?  No, I was out of the room.  Yes, I did. 
[02:50:30]  I went to leech.com.  It took you four years to get it.  It took you four years to get it.  Yeah, because you're on a waiting list, so you have to wait.  Right.  That's what a waiting list is.  Yeah, you have to wait.  Yeah.  That's good.  Danny's teaching hip-hop Ron how you mic someone that's wearing a horse.  You are.  I was holding the head.  Yeah, he was.  No, he was holding it in front of the horse's mouth on a horse mask.  But see, it was like a 12-inch snout off of the mask.  The person wearing the horse mask, you would actually mic the throat of the horse mask. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, okay.  Which would be close to the mouth of the person wearing the horse head.  But if a real horse ever comes in here to talk, you're the man to talk.  Yes, we're calling you.  Thank you.  For our exclusive interview with a horse, we've got the man for the job.  Yes, Jimmy.  So you got your Section 8, and you got it reduced?  How did you find out you could even do that?  Because my income went down a little bit.  So it's based on your income?  Wait, your income went from what to what? 
[02:51:30]  Well, it went from, I don't know, $16,500 to like just below $16,000.  Like $1,595 or something like that.  A year.  Oh, shame.  Yeah, so it goes up and down accordingly, and it slides.  And, you know, it's a grant.  A grant?  And the city picks up the rest, you know.  But I waited three years for it.  No, the city doesn't pick up the rest.  The taxpayers pick up the rest.  Well, I also get taxed heavily, too, you know, with my insurance and taxes. 
[02:52:00]  Are you out of your fucking mind?  You don't pay income tax.  Yes, I do.  They take maximum for my income.  You get it all back.  Yeah, I get 15% taken out plus my health insurance.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, 15% tax.  In April.  Yeah.  When you do your taxes.  I always get a refund.  You get a refund.  That is 100% of what you put in.  Yeah, but the last few years I didn't collect all of it because I owed taxes that were back taxes. 
[02:52:30]  I finally paid them all off both that way and, you know, just sending the money.  So now I don't owe anything.  So you don't pay taxes.  Yeah, I get everything back.  So you don't pay taxes.  Well, they take them out of my check.  But you get it back.  Stupid horse.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, you get it back.  Yeah.  So you make 16 G's and then your rent is, what did you say, for what? 
[02:53:00]  For 19.  A month?  Yeah.  Wow, that's kind of steep for a month.  Now it is before I was paying five, you know.  Oh, boy.  They must love that when they reduce it.  Oh, what is it?  I've seen you on Pal Talk.  You got like one single light bulb.  You're like in that jail cell from.  It's only one room.  Hopefully it's caretakers.  Caretaker.  It is like caretaker's fucking jail cell.  I want to fill your bulb up with gasoline. 
[02:53:30]  You know, I'm content with what I have.  Yeah, Brooksy.  What?  All right, Patty.  I guess we just give you your change and get the fuck out of here.  I got to go.  Trying to make a stimulating conversation with her, but it just doesn't work.  You dropped some change.  I think you dropped a little change.  It scared me.  What?  No. 
[02:54:00]  That hit my foot.  Yeah, no shit.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Let's see where this hits.  Oh, there it is.  I have a feeling of a change.  Patty, step closer.  I want to hand you the change.  Yeah, throw it at me.  What?  Step forward a little bit.  I can't.  Just step forward.  I wouldn't throw it at you.  No, move her over there.  Patty, here's my change.  Now clean it up. 
[02:54:30]  Enjoy.  Be a change picker-upper, just like your father.  Why is she rubbing her legs?  I didn't hit you.  Yeah, you're wearing those giant fucking boots.  It scared me because I can't see it.  Patty, it's fine.  Get a hold of yourself.  You're panicking and ruining the show.  Now, Patty, get...  You're a horse.  You're supposed to say it spooked you.  Patty, get naked because it's very hot in here.  And then start crawling around and pick up your change for everybody, all right?  Well, at least we made something sexy out of the bitch. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  You want me to crawl?  No, no.  No.  I'm watching.  Oh, God damn.  Patty, send her to the glue factory.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy.  I'll see you later.  All right.  Say goodbye to Jimmy going down to...  Going down to AC.  Got some tickets available maybe for Sunday's show.  Yeah, I'm going to let you in the area.  It'll be a long drive.  Bye, boys.  I'll see you next week.  All right, Jimmy.  I'll see you tonight.  All right, James.  Patty, continue. 
[02:55:30]  What is she...  Why are you covering your head?  I wish I could see.  Patty, what are you doing?  We're not even paying attention to you.  Just the head moves to the part where it's the cheek and you can't see.  Do you realize you'll be there for hours like that?  Yeah, it's like you're seeing double almost.  Huh?  Oh, really?  We should just have her keep the horse mask on and right through Ron and Fez, just keep 
[02:56:00]  collecting the change.  Until she dies of asphyxiation.  Yeah, we'll put this mask on.  It'll take forever.  Yeah, it certainly will.  Forever!  She almost kind of like taking on a horse kind of...  Unbelievable.  All right, Chris in Arizona.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  I got a quick question.  Yeah.  We all fuck up in life and we get into situations we can't control, but this is a woman who claims  to be very smart.  She's got a degree, a college degree.  How the hell does she, after all these years, never gotten a real job, eight hours a day, 
[02:56:30]  making a decent salary?  I mean, what the hell is the deal with that?  She's got mental issues, obviously, that we exploit on a regular basis.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  Great radio.  Love it.  All right.  Later, boys.  All right.  Yeah, because she is a very good worker, but she's doing something wrong.  Yeah, because she should have a 40-hour-a-week job.  Right.  She should be in her own place without government subsidy.  I'm amazed that with all these, you know, faithful listeners, not one of them have figured 
[02:57:00]  out a nice little spot for her.  A little job?  A little job, yeah.  It's not going to break anyone's bank if they own a business.  They'll get a really good worker.  It's too bad she lives in the city, you know?  We could use help like her at the old restaurant.  That's another thing.  She decides to fucking live in Manhattan.  Right.  Of all places.  It's the only place I could get.  Nothing else was available.  Patty, are you out of your mind?  You know how much cheaper it is to go into some fucking shithole in Jersey?  Newark would be perfect for you.  Yeah, Newark would be great. 
[02:57:30]  You could live in a penthouse in Newark.  On $4.19 a month or whatever it was.  The train terminal and Berry Street.  Yeah, no trains go to Jersey.  Yeah.  Yeah, path.  Patty, you're going to have to take...  And she goes, yeah, path.  Patty, you're going to have to take breaks because if you take the horse mask off at  any time during this, then we take all the money back.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Footer.  Footer!  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[02:58:00]  What's going on?  Hey, man.  We hope you're going to appreciate this one.  Back when Danny had said earlier about going to see Metallica twice instead of seeing Primus  or whatever.  Yeah.  Anyway, back in, like, 19...  Probably almost like 1990.  Hold on, man.  All the change Patty picked up, she dropped on the floor.  She can't even do this job right.  I think she was trying to put it in the bag.  What happened, Hip Hop?  She went to put the money in the Ziploc bag and she just missed it completely.  So now she's got to start over?  And that's all the...  Ah!  After five minutes, that's all she collected was a handful? 
[02:58:30]  Oh, my God.  I apologize to Ron and Fez in advance, but this is how it's got to go down.  She doesn't get to just quickly pick up the change.  She's got to start over again.  She missed the bag in one hand with the change in the other hand.  All right, go ahead, Footer.  Motor skills on Michael J. Fox.  Yeah, Footer?  Anyway, sorry.  Yeah.  So my buddy calls me up and he's like, hey, he's like, I'm going to the limelight tonight.  He goes, I'm going to see a few bands.  I don't know who's playing, but I'm going down there.  So I go down there. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, so I end up not going down there and he ends up telling me it was Smashing Pumpkins,  Pearl Jam.  And Red Hot Chili Peppers was like the main group.  I totally just blew it off for like no reason.  You probably could have been like 10 feet from the stage, you know.  I saw that gig.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, no, Billy Corrigan.  I met him behind, you know, any one of those fucking things.  I blew it for no reason.  That sucks.  I went to that gig and Smashing Pumpkins opened the whole thing up.  And I was the guy that said, who the fuck are these assholes?  They'll never make it. 
[02:59:30]  You just made it.  Exactly.  That's exactly fucking God.  Great.  All right, boys.  Have a great day.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, Pop, how much change has she picked up?  She got her original handful back.  Handful?  Yeah, a handful.  There's hundreds of handfuls on the floor.  Yeah.  She keeps moving from pile to pile, not realizing it's all one area.  Yeah, why don't you just clean up one?  You're grazing like a horse.  Right.  You're going around.  Oh, my God.  She's one by one by one.  Oh, there it goes.  Into her pockets.  Into the pockets, Patty. 
[03:00:00]  In her sweatshirt.  Looks like you have a bunch.  I know.  Now it's all sagging down.  Looking good, Patty.  Yeah, by the way, you can't.  Someone is suggesting that we don't give you a bag.  You got to just carry it home any way you can.  Yeah.  It's with a fucking baggie.  You're breaking the rules.  What hip-hop?  No, there's a hole in it.  She realized there's a hole in it.  She's picking up pennies.  Oh, I don't see them.  Why don't you pick up the higher denominations first, so that when we fuck you over, you'll 
[03:00:30]  at least have that.  What is she doing?  She's like, how could you not see?  There's 80 holes in that fucking horse head mask.  Are you getting hot in the horse head mask?  Yeah, a little.  But it's hard to see now, because it's sagging them.  We know.  Is it hard to see in it?  All right.  She just won't shut up.  We got the prank call from the Access show.  Yeah.  This is worth playing, right?  What is that?  A little audio.  Man pranks public access show. 
[03:01:00]  Well, yeah, it's kind of like a double-header thing.  I mean, on one hand, he's trying to prank this public access show, but then on the other  hand, the guy who's doing the show live is having a problem with getting rid of him.  Oh, really?  So not only does he have to deal with a prank caller, but now he has to deal with a prank  caller he can't get rid of.  Ah, nice.  Let's take a listen to this.  Let's see who this is going to read out here.  Hello, caller.  You're on the air.  Hello. 
[03:01:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, you said you learn from your viewers, and they can learn from you.  I have a question.  Sure.  Be nice now.  Was Jesus gay?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe.  I think that would probably be a question for you to ask me, sir.  I would, I would, I would really like to rant you right in the back hatch.  Uh, why would you say you're, you worked on a ranch before? 
[03:02:00]  I was.  I, I, I, you, I think I worked, uh, on a ranch too, one time.  You're a red shirt ad.  You're a red shirt ad.  Look at you struggling.  Yeah, I know.  That's all right.  Oh, man.  We're the fool.  Look at you, you piece of s***.  Okay.  Oh, man.  What's the deal?  No.  What's the deal?  So, anyway. 
[03:02:30]  So, you have to understand, it's live, right?  And so, as he's pranking him, he's watching him on the television.  Right.  So, yeah.  So, now the guy's fumbling on his little phone bank, and that's when you hear the guy on the phone go,  ah, look at you struggling.  You're a red shirt.  What do you call him, a red shirted ass?  You're just a red shirted ass.  A red shirted ass.  He couldn't hang up on him.  You're struggling, struggling, a little bit.  What are you following, my f***?  All right.  Rickety-cricket, chirp-chirp, DJ.  Yeah, Rickety-cricket.  Let's put Daddy Mago. 
[03:03:00]  Daddy Mago.  Come on, let's turn it off.  Turn it off.  Find the button.  Come on.  How's that for you?  Now you can hear me now, huh?  You can still get the f***.  So, nobody can hear you.  So, let's go to, um, the three's on the beat.  You're doing small.  Okay.  So, basically, in that clip, though, the guy's panicking so bad that he, because obviously he can't disconnect the call, 
[03:03:30]  so he thinks, in a panic situation, the best thing that he can come up with for his show  is to just try to drown the guy out with music.  With an Aldo Nova song?  So, he obviously hears me.  He goes, yeah, well, now no one can hear you.  And it's just like, well, I got news for you, show host.  No one can hear you either.  Now you're just playing music.  Like, what's worse, having the guy just, you know, hand you your own ass or just play a song on the television?  How could he not tell the guy off?  I don't know.  He was, somebody I'm sure could have helped. 
[03:04:00]  Like, look at you struggling.  But, oh, man, were they not helping at all.  And he's just pressing buttons and nothing's working for him.  Good.  It was just so great to see him in a panic.  It's hard to hear, unfortunately.  Yeah, I don't remember it being so muddy like that, yeah.  Yeah, I'm going off the reaction of the people on the bleachers.  Oh, well, you can ditch it.  That's fine.  I thought it was funny, you know, eight weeks ago.  It's just hard to hear.  Yeah.  It's like tinny.  Muddy.  I thought it was funny, though. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  I'll fix it.  Like when anyone's fucked.  All right, Patty, how you doing?  It's the horse.  No, don't do that, please.  No.  The horse head is slipping and I can hardly see where anything is.  No, she can hardly say the change.  Well, you really need the change, though, Patty.  She's having such a hard time.  Patty, I might just invite all the listeners to come in and collect change.  You might have to fight the rest of the audience for it. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, the pennies also look like dimes if you look at them faster.  Yeah, if you're colorblind and have no sense of touch.  How about you go for the quarters?  They don't look like anything but quarters.  Yeah, she's moving it around.  That makes it harder to see.  She is a fucking mess.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  We're just taking a look at it.  What are you doing?  Oh, Patty.  I just pulled it off.  Who pulled the mask off? 
[03:05:30]  That's a penalty.  Patty, they're calling a penalty.  That's really bad.  Wow, she's really hanging on.  She really hung on to that.  Danny tried to...  Oh, there goes the change again on the floor.  My knees are hurting.  Are they, you whore?  I have arthritis syndrome.  She's got arthritis as she tries to pick up change to pay her bills. 
[03:06:00]  This is hilarious.  Why don't you use the bunny mask as knee pads?  No, I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to ruin the mask.  You don't want to hurt what?  The bunny mask.  You're, like, really stupid.  Because she's picking up the same change for the third time now.  You fucking wreck.  Huh? 
[03:06:30]  I'm just thinking, Anthony brings up a good point.  I mean, she really is retarded, because I could think of probably seven better ways to pick up that change.  Yeah.  Than doing what she's doing, which is just using her thumb and forefinger and trying to pick up each coin individually.  Yeah.  You're not going to give me a probe.  No, but I think using, I think that there's certain, you know, you have, like, no survival skills.  Like, how would you ever survive?  Like, you have to use things around you to your benefit, and I just don't see how you're not grasping that concept. 
[03:07:00]  A simple tool.  You can definitely sweep it into a pile and then get a little more than one at a time.  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  And that's why I'm not going to help you, because I think you deserve to sit there and pick up each coin individually.  Because if you don't have the brains to actually figure out how to do this efficiently, then you deserve to be there on your knees like that.  You're going to roll those up, Patty, or just take them to the bank, like, in your sweatshirt? 
[03:07:30]  Patty?  What?  Holy shit.  What?  You're going to roll those up, or are you going to just take it to the bank like that in your sweatshirt?  You can just go to TD Bank and just drop it in the machine.  Yeah, they got free coin counting or whatever the hell they call it.  Oh, that's what I saw Reed just doing.  Yeah, wow.  All right, the good news is we only have 37 minutes left in the show, so we'll take a break and figure out something next.  Opie and Anthony.  New from ONA Films, the story of a mentally ill vagabond dog without a home. 
[03:08:00]  Patty!  I want to be your friends.  I don't want to lose contact with anybody.  We're not your friends.  I didn't...  I'm going to have to cut you loose, Patty.  Forced to sleep in hallways and closets, her life was one major disappointment after another.  I mean, how many times could we shave your head?  But I don't want to lose anybody.  You don't have anybody.  Desperate for attention, she wouldn't go away.  Patty was living here, didn't ask anyone's permission. 
[03:08:30]  No matter how harsh the abuse.  Take the wig!  Please, please.  Take the wig!  Don't do it, please.  I don't want anyone to see me.  I can't go to work like this.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll want to strangle this annoying derelict.  Patty!  We have no use for you anymore.  Bye-bye.  The virus.  XM-202.  Series 197.

[03:11:00]  Oh, make your peace, I'm out of the way.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We just checked in with Patty.  She's breathing really heavy.  She thinks she needs her asthma medication.  She's a fucking mess.  You all right, Patty?  Patty.  What?  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  You're breathing heavy.  I'll survive.  Huh?  I'll survive.  Do you need your asthma medication?  I'll survive. 
[03:11:30]  She stinks.  Patty.  What?  Do you need your asthma medication?  I'm okay.  I'm fine.  You were breathing all heavy, though, and you're fucking, like, talking about your asthma and  your arthritis.  It's okay.  You're a fucking wreck.  I don't need it.  And also, did you work today?  I'm breathing.  I'm fine.  Shut up.  Did you work today?  Not today.  Yesterday.  Did you shower?  Ah, yeah.  When was the last time you showered?  Be fucking honest.  Don't lie.  Last night.  And don't lie, because I'll know. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Last night.  Last night.  Because we're getting reports.  I shower every night.  We're getting reports that you stink.  I don't.  That you have B.O.  What do you think about that?  What about your clothes?  Did you wash that sweatshirt?  Uh, actually.  Actually what?  No.  No?  Actually, no.  I'm going to go back on again.  All right.  Oh, see, that's why you're reeking, then.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm not. 
[03:12:30]  How much change did you have collected?  No, you are.  You collect a lot of change already, Patty?  I guess.  I can't.  You're going to be here all day.  I guess I did.  Yeah.  Hey, where's my buddy Danny?  Is he out there?  Smells like a horse.  I'm right here.  Yeah, come on in here, bro.  Are you broke?  I'm not broke.  You're not broke?  Nope.  All right.  That's open for debate.  I'll take the money.  You'll take the money away from Patty? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I'll take it.  No, if you're not broke, whatever.  It's fine.  What's going on?  Oh, you don't care.  He's taking it anyway.  Oh, Danny.  He got right down there.  Danny, hello.  What are you doing?  He got right down there, and he's taking it.  Yeah, get on mic here.  What's going on in your world, sir?  Not much.  I just helped out with the moving job.  A moving job?  That's big for you.  Let's see.  Yeah, I was helping out with the moving job.  Is that what you do?  Yeah, I help out with moving jobs.  My sister's father.  Oh, okay. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  That's a lot of heavy lifting and stuff, right?  Yeah, it's heavy lifting.  It's heavy lifting.  The boxes get heavy.  You're not like a big guy, though.  It seems like it might be a tough job for you.  Usually when I see movers, they're big, like, burly men.  That's why they sometimes have two people sometimes.  Yeah?  Really heavy stuff, you've got to have two people.  Most of the time, but because of the economy, it's mostly storage, and it is moving.  Oh, people storing their stuff?  Yeah, my sister's father has these storage containers somewhere in Fairfield. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  How many bodies are in there now since you know the combination?  I have no idea what the heck they put in those boxes.  I just know.  I just load them on the truck and just pull them out of the truck.  That's all.  Fascinating.  Hey, what do you think of the plane crash there?  Well, coincidence enough, I was watching season four of Lost. 
[03:14:30]  Right.  So it's just coincidence that this happened to happen, and I said, damn, what's the odds  of that?  I'm watching Lost that this happens.  Well, you know.  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  You watch a TV show about a plane crash.  Coincidence, though, enough speaking of plane crashes, I had a crazy dream a week ago about  I'm on a plane.  I happened to be on a plane that happened to be an Oceanic.  Yeah.  And Black Earl was the pilot. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, really?  That's trouble right there, right?  Yeah, that's trouble.  You certainly didn't make it to your destination then, sir.  Yeah, that's trouble.  Did he pass out while he was trying to land?  And my sister, for some reason, is playing around with the liquid ass.  Oh, fuck.  What's going on there?  That's kinky.  I don't know what the heck she's doing, but she's just spraying it all over the plane,  and I'm telling her, say, no, Shannon, keep that away from Black Earl. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  That's a weird dream.  It's a show dream.  You have a lot of show-related dreams with people from the radio shows?  No, sometimes, usually sometimes if I'm watching a movie or something, maybe I've had dreams about  that, I remember once I had this, I don't know, I'm watching this show on the cable,  Aquitine Hunger Force.  Of course.  And there's this talking meatball-like character, the meatwad.  Yes.  And I had a crazy dream where, for some reason, there's a gigantic meatwad in the house. 
[03:16:00]  I had cartoon dreams when I was six.  I remember once Casper made a duty.  And that was usually when those stopped, but so you have cartoon dreams, huh?  No, not really cartoons.  It's usually sometimes it's, if I'm watching something, if I'm up late and I'm watching something.  Then it becomes something in your dreams.  Why don't you watch porno so you can, like, you know, maybe get a little in your dream?  Yeah, that actually happened once where I fell asleep at a porn, watching one once. 
[03:16:30]  Wait a minute, at a porn theater?  No.  Are you going to say?  No, I'm at my house.  Oh, at your house.  You're watching a porno.  You fell asleep and what, you started dreaming that you were in the porno?  Yeah.  Did you make cumzies on yourself?  Yeah, you're saying like that, embarrassing enough, though.  I, a phone call wakes me up.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  That's embarrassing. 
[03:17:00]  Jiminy Cricket.  Woo!  Who could that have been on the phone?  I don't know.  It was my cousin, for some reason, who for a while is having all these concerns ever since  Obama's won the election.  Yeah.  He has all these crazy, he has all these weird concerns.  Maybe you could give your cousin my number.  We could hash it out.  What's his concerns?  He's just having concerns about all, losing money, having a, being overtaxed.  Yeah?  Am I your cousin? 
[03:17:30]  Very concerned.  No, but, but easy enough, you, you could easily fit, you'd fit in very well with a lot  of my relatives.  Really?  Why, do they hate you, too?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's for some, for some reason, they're always very entertaining,  though.  Oh, well, thank you.  It might.  That's good.  Do they, does this cousin have a problem with Obama for any other reason?  Maybe racially or anything?  No, he's, no, he's just concerned about this country turning into a communism. 
[03:18:00]  Turning into a communism?  Yeah, I mean, turning into a communist country.  Right, right.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, well, it's very socialist programs that he wants to put in there, you know?  I know, for a while, I think almost, it was like, like, almost like a month after the  election, I'm getting calls and I'm saying, is this another Obama call that he's,  and he's pointing, and he's pointing out something on, on Hannity and, Hannity and  Combs, and I'm, do you like Obama?  I, I got very mixed opinions about this guy. 
[03:18:30]  What, what do you like about him?  And then what don't you like about him?  Well, the thing is, he's, he's like a big question mark.  Yeah.  So it's like, I have no, so I can't complain about him there, but at the other part, though,  This is just like, kids say the darndest things.  Isn't it?  Wait, so, so the positive, the what is a question mark?  That's the bad thing?  Yeah, the question, the question mark is, either there's something good going to come out of 
[03:19:00]  this or something bad about it, because he, he doesn't say anything.  Positive, maybe.  Well, every time I see this guy spoke during election, all I keep saying is, like, we need  change in just about every sentence.  Yeah, well, that was his catchphrase, sure.  Every sentence, we need change, yes we can.  And you're on an impression?  Wow, you sound like the real people.  That's all he seemed like he keeps saying, all right?  Yeah, all right, what are you talking about, change?  What kind of change are you talking about? 
[03:19:30]  They say, if you want change, then I'll, I'll mail you some change, I'll send it to  16 countries, Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania Avenue.  So that's what you don't like about him, what do you, what do you like about him?  You said you had mixed, you know, feelings, so that means you probably.  Well, the good thing is, I have a feeling that maybe he'll, he'll put more troops in  Afghanistan and finally get that fucker by the name of bin Laden, hopefully.  Wow, you're way off of that.  Well.  That ain't happening.  I don't think so.  He might pull back a little bit, my friend. 
[03:20:00]  He might be going that direction.  Hey, someone said that you said that you helped your sister's father, right, with the moving  thing?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be your father?  She's got a different father than me.  Okay.  All right.  Oh.  That answers that.  Same mom, though?  Yeah, same mom.  All right.  But she's not the only, she's not the only sibling of mine that has a, that shares only  one parent.  Really?  No, I got two brothers that share the same father.  Two brothers, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:20:30]  Do you have two brothers that have the same father and your mother?  No, no, no.  I got two, two brothers that share only the same father.  My father.  Your father.  And then you have another, a sister that shares the mother.  Yeah.  What the fuck is going on at your place?  No, no, it's simple.  My father had a previous marriage prior to my mom.  Yeah.  Yeah, we figured that much out.  All right.  And then my, my sister, my sister, of course, has, has a different father. 
[03:21:00]  Right.  Danny, now, last time you were in here, you were talking about your neighborhood.  Is it getting better?  You were, you were bitching about what?  The Mexicans, was it?  I was just saying there was too, too many illegals.  Too many illegals, right.  E-legals.  And they're like, uh, leaving trash on the lawns and stuff when they're waiting for jobs?  Yeah.  Actually, not only that.  Oh.  It's a freaking reason why you're, why people are, why we're all overtaxed to this country. 
[03:21:30]  Why?  Too many of them.  Because of the illegals?  Yep.  Illegals.  What do they do that makes us pay so many taxes?  Symbols.  I'm having to, them being here in this country, sneaking in, and actually getting, getting,  getting past the borders and probably living here illegally.  And that's hurting our taxes?  Yeah, it is.  Well, that's fascinating. 
[03:22:00]  Wow, you should be president.  Yeah.  What else is going on?  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing this weekend?  Uh, I'm not, not, not, not much.  Just.  Don't look at me, like, for an invite.  I'm just asking.  Yeah, come by the house.  I'm not.  Huh?  Nothing?  I'm not doing that much.  Not much.  What do you do for fun?  We don't, we barely know ye.  What are you doing for fun?  What do you do for fun?  Simple.  I just go, I go, I go, I go visit, I go visit some of my friends. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Are they real?  Yeah, yeah, they are.  Oh, okay.  What do you do with your friends?  I don't know.  I watch movies, play video games.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I, I invite them when I'm going someplace.  Okay.  You're very vague, Danny.  You really are vague.  Like, you can't say, ah, well, you know, we go to a certain bar or hang out and. 
[03:23:00]  Like, when you go places, like where?  The mall?  The movies?  No, sometimes, uh, something's a restaurant down, out in the, out where I live.  Yeah.  All right.  And I see you're wearing a Pink Floyd hoodie.  Yeah, it's, it's a shirt I got for Christmas.  Yeah, it's nice.  You like the Pink Floyd, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a nice shirt.  What's your favorite Pink Floyd song?  I, I don't really have a, have a specific song, specific favorite in particularly.  No.  Any, uh, ladies in your life, uh, lately? 
[03:23:30]  No.  No dating?  No, not lately.  It's a lot, last, last time was, last time was 2019, but that late, that broad moved away.  That broad moved away.  What did you get off the 19-year-old?  Did, unfortunately, she moved away before I got anything off of her.  Ah, damn her.  Really?  Yeah, damn her.  What were you going for?  No, I, no, I thought I was going to get something off of her, but then she, she freaking, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, thought, thought it was so cold, that she, she just said, I don't know, I think the reason she said she was moving away, she just says so cold, you just couldn't take it. 
[03:24:00]  You're sure she didn't say, it'll be a cold day in hell?  No, no, she thought it was so cold here.  How cold was it?  Well, I don't know, but I know cold enough she moved someplace warmer.  Oh my God.  He made her move.  Oh my God.  And I, I, I, I, I didn't tell, I didn't tell her to move, but I said, said, I said, if you can't take, if you can't take it so cold, then what the heck are you, you, you living here in the winter time? 
[03:24:30]  Oh, so you kind of gave her the idea to leave.  Yeah, I can't.  Good move.  Wow.  I just keep looking and just, we're just not getting to 11 o'clock.  Yeah, kind of, kind of regretted that one.  It's called, it's called trying to get traction.  Oh my God, the fucking clock is going backwards at this point in my brain.  What happened?  Oh, that would just, no.  Yeah, that, that, that, that happened to me a lot. 
[03:25:00]  If I'm, I'm going some, if I'm going on some warm trip, I think, I think it's some, I think I'm closer than I think, and then all of a sudden I'm, I'm further.  Yeah, objects in mirror are closer than they appear, and that's why.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  I'm looking out the window, and I think it's a, I think it's a area.  I swear that.  I swear.  All right, just, uh.  I felt the hanger.  Disappointed audience I've ever seen. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  All right, Danny, thank you so much for coming in and trying to save the show, but I think we failed there.  They're calling you radio mold instead of radio gold.  What's wrong, buddy?  Would you sit the fuck down?  God damn, you dunce.  What are you, why are you breathing so heavy?  What's up?  Are you done collecting the change?  It's my mesothelioma from working in the shipyards. 
[03:26:00]  But now I.  Oh, wow.  She's really stinking?  Dude, really?  Yeah.  Patty, it's just a dumb.  No, I'm okay, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  No, dude, sit down and shut up.  Get a rock.  I want a smell test on Patty.  You can smell it from up there.  Yeah.  You can smell Patty's armpits.  Could you please?  I perspire.  What can I tell you?  Perspire what? 
[03:26:30]  Shit.  No, get right in her armpit.  Yeah, her hair smells too.  Really?  Sorry.  All right, what are we smelling?  Our armpit?  No, let's take this off.  Wow, E-Rock, you want to see her naked?  Yeah, E-Rock.  All right, you sick fuck.  That's E-Rock's fucking.  E-Rock's fetish.  Yeah.  Alien bodies.  Take it off.  Oh, E-Rock, is it bad?  Yeah, she's just flapping her shirt around.  All right, smell right under that armpit.  Get in there, get a good sniff.  Oh, whoa. 
[03:27:00]  Patty.  Patty, what are you doing?  You don't wear, you don't do a little, you know.  You wear deodorant?  Yes, I do, but when I exert myself, I have, that's why I always have to take a shower when  I get home from home.  I can't stop.  If you had headphones on, you would know that mic's not working.  Yeah.  I just want to.  I'm just hearing strange space noises.  I just want to go.  It's so stupid.  Thank you, Patty.  You could pick up the rest of the change without the horse mask on, all right? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, and do it slow.  I just have to take another shower.  That's, well, I don't know.  How about you, look at her.  She's fucking got more mics around.  Oh, stop it.  You might get her an asthma attack.  It's not that bad.  It's pretty bad, Patty.  Yeah.  Well, stop it.  I'm not to talk.  Don't breathe that in, Patty.  You're going to have an asthma attack.  Patty, let us know, like, Monday, how much change that was.  I'm curious.  Oh, you sure will. 
[03:28:00]  I'll call in and let you.  Oh, thank goodness.  Now, hip-hop, why would the mic work now if it wasn't working before?  This is a different mic.  Now, that one's working, but it wasn't when you put it under the face.  All right.  Oh, stop it.  Now I really have to take the shower.  Ah, he sprayed it right down her ass crack.  That's probably a real treat down there.  Yeah.  Ass crack, you know, that doesn't usually smell when you're all sweaty.  All right, Patty. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, stay seated.  You're a fucking wreck.  Every time you're on the show now, we've got to worry about you dropping fucking dead.  Yeah, we can't do bits with you anymore.  You're heaving, huffing, and puffing.  You're fucking arthritis.  You're asthma.  You're fucking heart.  You're lungs.  Yeah, but I'm very strong, though.  No, you're not.  You can't even pick up.  You're a fucking sickly individual.  You can't even pick up change without it making it look like you just ran a marathon.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, we're closing out for the day.  Thank you, Patty.  Thanks, Patty.  All right, take your change and pay a bill or something.

[03:32:00]  She's a freak.  You know the name of this show.  It's called Deuce the Audience.  I should tell the fine folks out there a little bit about Opie and Anthony.  Agree, agree.  Agree, laugh, laugh, laugh.  Agree, laugh, agree.  Agree, laugh, laugh.  This is awful.  Please like me.  Please like me.  Please like me.  We have just an audio diarrhea.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh.  Laugh, laugh.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh.  Time to agree. 
[03:32:30]  Agree, agree.  Please like me.  Please like me.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh.  This is just horrible to listen to.  I better laugh so people think what was just said is funny.  That'll be.  Oh, Jesus.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We have no business being here.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh, laugh.  Oh, just laugh.  And I laugh because you're uncomfortable.  I don't know why I find that hysterical every time.  It's a hoot 100% of the time.  It's a hoot.  Go me and Anthony. 
[03:33:00]  Hey, we got something that's been making its way around one of the fan sites.  I don't know which one.  I would give you credit.  But the Quincy clip.  Oh.  See, Jimmy does Jim C, obviously.  Jim C.  Which is based on Quincy, obviously.  Loosely based on the Quincy character is Jim C, which is exactly like Quincy.  There have been similarities.  People have pointed out.  Yeah.  No fingerprint expert.  He has certain weird clipped words.  Expert.  Clips. 
[03:33:30]  And now.  Clip.  I guess the next stage of this bit, people are finding Quincy clips that they think are  ridiculous or funny or whatever.  And it's not supposed to be funny because it was a drama.  It was a drama.  No one really realizes that this show had credibility.  It was a serious show.  And it was on the heels of the odd couple.  It was after he had left the odd couple as Oscar Madison.  So it was kind of odd to see him in a drama.  There was some comedic moments and comedy elements throughout the thing.  But basically, it was supposed to be like a serious show. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  And at the time, I don't know how, but it was.  Now, you listen back and it's like, this is horrible.  It stinks.  And when Quincy would talk, he would take his thumb and he would take the other four fingers.  This picture going, Mamma Mia.  Right, right.  The way you do your fingers for Mamma Mia.  That's how he would talk.  Even when he was just talking casually.  He's a harder guy to do when he's not angry.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's always wearing a dick sweater or some fucking Iranian president members only jacket. 
[03:34:30]  And is this the punk rock clip?  Yeah.  He wants to talk to a bunch of punk rockers.  This stinks.  It's almost a parody of a show that stinks.  It's so bad.  It's so completely bad.  He's in a punk rock bar.  You want to play the first clip even though it's slightly long?  I mean, the punk rock clips are the big get here.  But the first clip's funny because the over-the-top caring is like, why would you care about the answers? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, right.  It's the one we listened to earlier.  Yeah, yeah.  I got you.  Well, let's start with this clip from Quincy way back in the day.  And then we'll get to the punk club.  The punk clips.  I could blow him up even bigger if you want, Quincy.  Oh, thanks.  You can blow him up the size of an elephant.  We still wouldn't get a clear print out of it.  Clear print.  Clear print.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having?  Those overlapping prints we found on the earth.  That was some of Steve's acting right there.  Not your day.  That was his fucking awful boss.  John Astin, his real name was, I think? 
[03:35:30]  I don't know.  Was it?  That fucking dumb mustache.  What was his name?  How'd your parents die?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We haven't done an autopsy.  You could blow him up as big as an elephant.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  I'm not going to get a clear print.  Print.  Clear print.  Here, listen to the Steve actor by the other guy.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having?  Those overlapping prints we found on the ice cream.  These?  Yeah.  Well, what about them?  Well, we blow them up.  Hoping to squeeze some more information out of them, but no such luck. 
[03:36:00]  Now, Quincy, maybe there is a way to unscramble these prints.  It's like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  There isn't a fingerprint man alive who'll get a positive ID based on what's here.  Not a man, but a machine, maybe.  Machine?  Hey, visions of buying one until I looked at the price.  Remember that computer show I went to in May?  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Who cares where it was?  At the convention center?  No, no, the arena.  You sure?  Because I remember the one at the convention center.  Right.  Who cares where it was?  A computer show at the convention center where they have one computer? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, one computer.  See, because they were real large back then.  That's my large computer joke.  It was so bad, the information they were giving.  It was too pricey back in May.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Just a machine?  Machine?  A computer?  A machine?  I was going to get one, but it was a little too pricey.  Oh, you a Jew.  So, because it was too pricey, there's, like, dozens of murders they're not going to solve.  Yeah.  Too pricey.  Too pricey. 
[03:37:00]  I'll try to do it the old-fashioned way and save a few bucks.  We would have fingerprints, Sam, but the boss is a jerk.  This guy never saw a penny that he didn't like.  We can't get a clear print.  A clear print.  I bet we could get clear prints off a penny from your pocket.  Puck, you're a Jew.  Quincy's an anti-Semite.  There's six million of them, Sam, and they're hiding somewhere. 
[03:37:30]  Bobby Fisher was right.  The whole thing was a lie.  They were never murdered.  Tom, wait a minute.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking crime lab.  You're in my...  Quincy.  My.  Uh...  My.  My.  My.  This plot was murdered.  Here, let's go back to this clip.  Went to a May.  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Quincy, they had a graphics computer that could take two combined pictures and separate the images. 
[03:38:00]  No.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  But I was too cheap to buy it.  Too cheap.  Oy vey, Quincy.  Right.  Right.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  Come tell.  Maybe I'll just give them a call.  Pick up some modern computer equipment there, huh?  Help Quincy out.  Right.  It could actually separate two sets of fingerprints and play pong at the same time. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  That's awful.  So then Quincy, in this particular episode, he goes to a punk rock club.  Yeah.  And he convinces the punk rock club manager to let him go on stage and talk to the youth.  He wanted to talk to the kids.  But do you have...  It is the part where he's trying to convince them.  And like, I just convinced them.  And the fuck, he's wearing this shit-thick sweater, and the manager stinks.  Go ahead. 
[03:39:00]  It's so bad.  If you want to, good luck with that.  And the punk rock kids are...  Not kids, first of all.  Right out of central casting, as they like to say.  Just awful.  The dialogue.  Hey, man.  Right.  They're just really not convincing.  They look like they have Halloween costumes on.  Yeah, it looks like now how you would Halloween dress as a punk.  Right, of course.  Well, they can't have real punk rockers on TV.  That would scare the shit out of everybody. 
[03:39:30]  It was wholesome TV back then.  So this is the edgiest they could get if they have a punk rock character.  But look at how fucking fast the music shuts down.  They're all quiet.  Listen, there's nothing not awful about this.  It's amazing how they took awfulness, and they just stretched it over a bunch of moments.  And wasn't punk rock all about, fuck the establishment.  Yeah.  Establishment.  And as soon as Quincy walks on, obviously, like, he's the establishment.  Oh, the music shuts down.  Everyone is quiet immediately.  They'd be like, what the fuck?  Wouldn't you just start throwing chairs at the man? 
[03:40:00]  I wish it was a Gigi Allen show.  Right.  He could shit in Quincy's face.  Fucking shit out of banana.  He just shoved up his ass into Quincy's mouth.  Him and his brother Merle would have homosexual relations, Sam.  He's pissing on the crowd.  Gigi.  A Gigi Allen show.  Fucking Gigi.  I want to talk to the murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  Murder junkies.  Here's something about Gigi. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Could we stop the music?  They hate me and I hate you.  He's throwing feces at me, Sam.  I said I do.  So what?  No.  You never liked me, so I said fuck you.  Yeah.  You know, you know.  Quincy tapping his foot, singing along.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Quincy's shoving a banana up his ass and throwing it at the audience.  With those stupid Mamma Mia fingers.  Mamma Mia fingers. 
[03:41:00]  Looks like the Italian guy on a pizza box.  Yeah, exactly what it is.  If I could just talk to him.  Everything's an intense moment.  How about this?  You give us an autopsy report and then go fuck cardboard ass.  Cardboard ass.  Because that's all you're supposed to do.  Exactly.  The coroner isn't going out investigating at some punk rock club.  Of course he's not.  He's a coroner.  He's a cop.  He's a lover.  He's an alcoholic.  He rubs his fucking dirty balls on his boss's awful mustache.  And he fingers Lieutenant Monahan's ass when he's fucking tired.  Busy man, that Quincy. 
[03:41:30]  They play Let's Check the Prostate.  We both know what it's about.  Sticks his whole hand in there with his Mamma Mia hand.  Just five fingers go up there.  I'm going to fist you.  Here we go.  This is Quincy talking to the punk rock club manager before he goes on stage.  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids.  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl.  You look for everybody, innocent girl. 
[03:42:00]  Is it too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life?  Hey, be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to help you out, you've got another guest coming.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  That's punk rock, by the way.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  It sounds like...  I am Rock Quarry.  And listen to the music that's supposed to represent punk rock.  Yeah, that was the punk rock band playing in the background.  See, they can't even commit because it's stupid TV.  It sounds like... 
[03:42:30]  Easy listening rock.  Kind of like Dwayne Allman or something.  It's not punk.  No, that was punk, man.  I want to help an innocent girl.  Girl.  And the guy is like, well, baby.  You've got another guest coming if you think those kids...  It's like they took everyone who auditioned and started from the bottom up like the worst  actor got the game.  No, then you heard, well, what are you going to say when you go up there?  Well, if that's the guy that got it, how bad were the ones that didn't?  What did they say?  Nah, nah.  No, that's no good.  You didn't speak English. 
[03:43:00]  It was close.  All right, we'll give him a call back.  All right, here's Quincy trying to talk to the kids from the stage, man.  Please tell me the awful music stops.  I think so, yeah.  Please, can I be attached to, please?  It's very important.  There you go.  Wow.  Dead silent.  Wow, just like that.  Not shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Put the music back on, asshole.  Yeah, what happened to fuck the man?  Please, can I be attached to, please? 
[03:43:30]  It's very important.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, many of you know Abigail Garvin.  Garvin.  And all of you know that the police are looking for in connection with a murder that happened right here in front of this stage.  Now, all the charges against her have been dropped.  She's innocent.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me. 
[03:44:00]  This is so fucking bad.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sticks and stones can break my bones.  That's right.  But names will never hurt that girl.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  You can call me a coroner.  You can call me a sloppy sports reporter.  Just over-the-top acting.  Call me a flat-ass fucker.  Right.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her. 
[03:44:30]  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm only interested in helping Abby.  This is right out of a John Wayne movie.  That guy's got a laugh.  Is there four people in the club?  That guy's killing.  Yeah, there's like 20 people.  Big crazy club.  Yeah.  He's just a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Names you call me. 
[03:45:00]  An asshole.  It isn't just the word.  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sam has tiny genitals.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard.  And Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killer.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Besides, man.  The scapegoat? 
[03:45:30]  Who the hell cares?  And Clint leaves the stage.  Dejected.  Moping.  Unsuccessful.  Oh, well.  Mamma Mia hands in pocket.  And he gives all the details.  Molly Howard is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  Yeah.  What?  They would just be sitting there going, what?  An extra aspirin?  I mean, wow.  Codeine overdose?  What?  A little outrageous, huh?  Whoa, hey.  Molly Howard is trying to get her to take Tylenol PM. 
[03:46:00]  She's giving her melatonin.  Instead of regular Tylenol, it's Tylenol PM.  It's just horrid dialogue.  She's taking Abby's Breathe Right strips and rubbing them in her own ass crack first.  Considering they won't be invented for years.  Stupid Quincy.  Quincy stinks.  Quincy's a cunt.  He stinks.  But listen again.  It's the typical punk rock speech, man.  Yeah, man.  You're the problem, man. 
[03:46:30]  Society.  Society's the problem.  Does the dopey kid say a scapegoat?  He says a scapegoat.  You're a whole sick society with his dumb accent.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard.  And Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Besides, man. 
[03:47:00]  Escape goat.  Who the hell cares?  Yeah.  That really got him right there.  When the kid said, who the hell cares?  Yeah.  It's like, well, no one cares.  How do I battle that?  Smokezilla writes, Cody and Overdose, are they doing cough syrup shooters?  And someone else, Jimmy Jakes writes, I love that they just all take turns yelling at  Quince.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't all jump on at once and try to shut the fuck up.  Your line.  My line.  Her line.  His line. 
[03:47:30]  Back to me line.  You're sick society.  Society.  And he said, escape goat.  Escape goat.  It's like, he was wrong.  The word is escape.  And he shouldn't have used it there.  No way.  Anyway.  There you go.  Some Quincy audio.  Yeah.  That was an actual, a legitimate program back then.  Yeah.  Were people just dumber back then?  Was TV all so bad and unrealistic? 
[03:48:00]  We just didn't know any better, man.  It was that sick society.  It just seems like something like, we should have looked and gone, I don't think.  A coroner does this.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  This letter comes in from Kathy in Oklahoma.  She writes, dear Casey, I like getting fucked in my anus and in my cunt.  Could you play anal cunt for my boyfriend?  I also go ass to mouth.  Well, we'll get that right on for you.  Here's anal cunt on American Top Word. 
[03:48:30]  Obi and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  Brought me back to being a kid and you go to camp or something and you hang out with these people for like a week, two weeks and you think like...  You went through the nom together.  Yeah, and it's just a week of playing, you know, dumb sports and canoeing and crap.  And making pottery on days it rains.  And then your parents come and then you say goodbye and even as a little kid you realize, oh no, I'll never see these people again. 
[03:49:00]  I'm real sad.  I'm real sad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm extremely sad.  This is...  I don't know what this means.  But if you really step back and think about it, you know, especially if you went to camp as a kid, it was only a stupid week in your life.  Who cares if you don't see these people ever again?  I went to summer camp, so it was longer than that.  It was like...  You got to go all summer?  Yeah, it was pretty much the whole summer at what was called the Paul Bunyan Day Camp when I was living in Central Islip. 
[03:49:30]  The whole Bunyan Day Camp, babe, the blue ox.  Wait, was it on Long Island?  Yeah, yeah.  So you didn't even get to go away?  No, we had to take a bus there, but it was just like...  It wasn't that far.  It was in the middle of the woods somewhere and the counselors were all a bunch of, like, pot-smoking dope fiends.  So you took a bus or a couple exits down the highway to camp?  Yeah, yeah.  That's not going to summer camp.  You have to, like, you have to go over a bridge and start going up the mountains and stuff. 
[03:50:00]  No, we came home every day.  Ew.  It was day camp.  You didn't even get to sleep over with all your...  No.  With all your hormones going crazy in your body?  No, no.  I think I was a little young for the hormone things going crazy, but...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was day camp.  So we'd take a bus there and then they'd bus us back.  That's summer camp for poor people. 
[03:50:30]  For poor people.  We tend to live in clusters.  Right.  Yeah, it was real boring, too.  Like, after the first week, they ran out of stuff for us to do.  And we didn't have a cool...  It wasn't a cool camp with, like, canoeing and archery and things you see at, like, cool camps.  It was pretty much...  You either played softball or, like, soccer or kickball outside.  Or when it rained, they took you inside where you made, like, ashtrays out of clay. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  And that was it.  Nothing fun about it.  That's retard camp.  It really was.  My mother just sent us there because she wanted to, like, have fun a summer.  And she didn't want the kids around bugging her.  What do you mean by have fun?  Probably have sex with multiple partners.  I have no idea.  I don't know what she was into back then.  She was being groovy in her culottes.  I don't know.  It was...  Yeah. 
[03:51:30]  So she just, you know, sent us all off to day camp.  And it was that.  It sucked.  I did a little of that day camping, too.  Yeah.  Camp Alvernia, I think it was called.  I don't know.  The one on the lake?  Down by the lake?  Well, on the harbor there.  In Centiport.  I think it was Moose Lake.  It's closer, so I made that assumption.  Yeah.  The one that's right by the lake there with the...  Because that's one that they...  Like, it's a camp for nannies, I think. 
[03:52:00]  All pairs.  I don't know.  This is going right back.  In Centiport, I used to take my jet ski by there, and they would all lay out topless  because that's what they did in Europe, and they were all from, like, Sweden and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  So they'd lay out there, and you saw nothing but, like, these puttering jet skis doing circles.  Brip, brip, brip, brip, brip, brip, brip.  And I was one of them.  Brip, brip, brip, brip, brip, brip.  Thing could do, like, 60 miles an hour on the water, and I'm just doing...  Brip, brip, brip, brip, brip, brip.  A mile and a half.  In front of this place.  Of course you got to.  Of course you have to. 
[03:52:30]  This place is legendary.  I went to camp when I was a boy.  My mother said I went to camp when I was 13.  I didn't want to go.  And I remember we were such dorks that one of the guys thought it would be cool if we  all pretended we were dead when the counselor came in.  So we all laid out like we were dead.  What was wrong with you?  I don't know.  It wasn't my idea.  I just played along.  You just did not have a normal childhood, Jimmy.  You guys were playing dead because you heard the rumors of this guy touching kids, probably.  And that was the only way you could think of.  Play dead?  Yeah, play dead so he didn't violate you. 
[03:53:00]  No, he was young.  He was like 16 or 17.  He was a young dude.  He was like one of those guys up in the summer truck.  And how old were you?  13.  Not perfect.  Summer creep.  Perfect for the hormones that are raging through your body.  But you, what, did he come in and wake you up every morning?  No, but I forget what he walked in and we all just pretended we were dead.  Like, what?  Did it work?  No.  Of course it didn't.  We should have been.  No.  Watch out.  These guys are nuts.  Did you put ketchup around your neck or something? 
[03:53:30]  I think someone did do that.  Not on my neck.  Oh, no.  We were posing hacks.  What did he do?  Just dip his lunch into the kid's neck?  No, the worst.  For a little extra ketchup?  The worst out was when he walked in and you heard the, eh, of the screen door and he looked  around and then just, eh, and he walked out.  There was nothing.  And you thought it was going to be so cool and he went, oh my God, they're dead.  There was just nothing.  By nothingness.  No, the dorks had to just get up and go, all right, well, I had no impact.  Let's say hi to Scott on Long Island.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, guys. 
[03:54:00]  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  I went to that Paul Bunyan death camp myself.  Oh, you did?  I did.  And it was no picnic.  And Anthony, don't you BS?  You know it was no picnic.  Well, I know.  What do you have to add to this?  Oh, they, they, the, uh, the instructors, they throw you in a pool, whether you knew  how to swim or not, if you didn't, you know, if you didn't get to the front and back, you  know, you wouldn't get no lunch. 
[03:54:30]  They throw you in the woods and they take off and leave you in there for hours.  Hey, yeah, that happened to me.  Oh, yeah.  It happened to everybody.  It really was terrible.  I got tied to a tree.  Um, and then this big fat counselor took his big meaty paw and, and smacked my stomach  till he, he gave me pink belly where you just go bam, bam, bam.  And then left me tied to the tree.  That's, that's what you remember from that incident.  Yeah.  You blocked out everything else. 
[03:55:00]  I hope so.  You blocked it out.  I hope it stays repressed forever.  Wait, why did you add?  Because they were all a bunch of, I'd use the, you know, use the scum word.  Uh, and that's what they were.  They were just, uh, a bunch of low lives that were put in charge of these kids at the day  camp.  Well, who else is going to do that job in the summer?  I know.  Like, like cool kids were like lifeguarding and caddying and doing all that other stuff  that was kind of cool.  It was a crap, uh, day camp that had, uh, the worst counselors ever. 
[03:55:30]  I remember that guy.  He, he was like, I think it was Russian or something.  And he had this big, like meaty wrestler hand, big fat mitt.  And he would, he just like smashed me in the stomach as I was tied to a tree.  He tied me to a tree.  You tell your mother?  Yeah.  What'd she do?  She didn't care.  She had a date.  She was wild back then.  Wild.  I tell you.  Probably with him.  She probably paid him to do that to you. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  All right.  Sorry to bring up some memories.  Oh yeah.  Thanks.  It's all good.  Paul Bunyan death camp.  They called it the Paul Bunyan death camp.  Yeah.  Let's say.  We arrived in boxcars.  Let's say, uh, good afternoon to Cleveland.  Uh, what's up, Ray?  So I used to go to a day camp out, out here, um, in a suburb of Cleveland.  And it was the worst camp I've ever been to in my entire life.  The counselors had no control of the kids. 
[03:56:30]  They thought they did, but they never did.  You had counselors picking on kids, putting them down, all that stuff.  So I really relate to what Anthony's saying about like camps and stuff.  I think we all pretty much went to a camp growing up.  Oh yeah.  And why do you, you didn't need to control the kids.  Let them be, let them be wild.  It's camp.  Camp, huh?  I used to fight all the time with kids.  It was amazing.  Yeah, there were a lot of fights.  There were, you know, there was a bunch of kids being bussed from Central Islet to this 
[03:57:00]  Paul Bunyan day camp.  So, uh, there was a lot of trouble, a lot of racial, uh, uh, trouble back then.  Even when you were like 12?  Dude, it was Central Islet.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And we'd be on the bus and, and it was just like the, the black kids controlled the bus.  At 12 years old?  Yeah.  Little skinny white kids.  We're just sitting there like, oh boy, don't mouth off.  Don't mouth off.  Oh, oh, why did I get smacked in the face?  I didn't say a word.  I didn't even eyeball them.  You would get smacked? 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Occasionally.  You'd just, just as one guy was walking by, you'd get smacked in the face and they'd all  laugh and go, as they walked, as they walked to the back of the bus, oddly enough, you  know, uh, they, they, they had the freedom to sit wherever they want, but wanted to sit  in the back so they could pull shenanigans on the poor little white children of Central  I said, yeah, yeah.  That's a lot of slapping stories from your childhood.  I just walked by.  I was constantly being slapped and crying.  That was my whole childhood. 
[03:58:00]  Poor Anthony.  Poor me.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He was basically a punching bag.  I was so just abused.  It does explain a lot, though.  The mental abuse.  And then, like, we're finally seeing where the seed was planted now, Jimmy.  And I have so many, like, regrets that I remember in my head, like, moments that probably could  have been happy moments that I just didn't do the right thing or something.  There was, I was in Central Islip and, uh, it was a lot, just a lot of racial trouble. 
[03:58:30]  I, it was, I guess it was, you know, during the, uh, early seventies and, um, you know, the  races weren't getting along very well back then.  And, um, uh, blacks were coming, uh, out onto the, you know, this new sense of, uh, empowerment.  And it was time to get back at Whitey.  Uh, so, you know, us white kids kind of had to stick together and everything, but we never  did.  We never could.  And then I remember one time there was a little white girl named, um, uh, her name  was Dawn. 
[03:59:00]  It was kind of grossed me out a little because that's my sister's name.  It's nothing worse than, like, being in love or lust with a girl that's the same name  as your sister.  I've said just the opposite.  And, and Jimmy's case, it allows him to just relive, uh, the fond memories.  And I would just, I was telling, I was telling people how I really liked this girl and, and,  um, I guess the word got back to her and, and I was sitting at my desk and we had this  thing where we all had to make these little, little, um, kind of like a scenery, a little 
[03:59:30]  scenery thing of, uh, Thanksgiving or something.  So I made little pilgrims and everything and set them up and glued them to some construction  paper and, and did a whole nice thing.  And, and then they brought in other classes to, to kind of look around at our thing.  So I'm sitting at my desk all proud of my thing.  And this girl Dawn comes by and, um, and she looks at me and she must've gotten word that  I liked her cause she looked at my, my stupid little construction paper thing and then looked 
[04:00:00]  up at me and, and gave me this smile.  And I swear I had to be probably nine years old at the time, but the smile she gave me,  I still remember.  It was one of the, it sent like, like chills down my spine and I was like, Oh my God.  Oh Jesus.  And she kind of like looked at me a little more when she walked away to the next person's  stupid display.  That was probably a frigging bodega or a crack dealer. 
[04:00:30]  So I was sitting there thinking this is great.  And, uh, I'm going to talk to her, dude.  I never mustered up the balls to say a word to her.  And then it was just, you know, she goes along her merry way.  I had that one moment of a smile and I was like, Hey, it's, it's 80,000 years later.  And I'm still regretting not talking to this girl at nine years old.  Where's she at now?  I'm probably dating one of the black guys. 
[04:01:00]  Absolutely.  Probably dating a pilgrim.  That had such an impact on her.  I turned her off to white kids.  No, go get them gumption idiot that I was.  But that might've changed your life.  See, the good thing was if you would've talked to her, you might've dated her and then had  self-worth and you never would've been funny.  You wouldn't have needed to be funny.  That might've changed the course of your life.  You might be right.  That little, that little dumb kid might've wrecked you.  You would've had five kids by now too.  It could've been.  They could've changed.  You know, that is odd that there's that, that little, that might've been one of those 
[04:01:30]  forks in the road in your life.  And another situation happened in California.  And I talked about this one a while back when I was in school and this girl, very cute  girl was at her locker and she's bent down getting her stuff.  And some douche just kicked the locker door and hit her square in the head.  And, and she started crying and I was like three lockers away.  And all I wanted to do was go over there and comfort this crying girl that got her head 
[04:02:00]  smashed by the locker.  And again, just what a pussy.  I couldn't muster up the, the confidence that a girl that just got her head smashed, that  if I gave her a little comfort, she wouldn't just reject me.  So I'm sitting there and I, uh, should, should I go?  Should I do?  But moment over moment over, idiot.  Just shut your locker, go to class and regret it for 50,000 years. 
[04:02:30]  Are you, um, having a nervous breakdown?  No, no.  This is the stuff that keeps you from having a nervous breakdown.  You just vent it all out.  It's just memories of your childhood, uh, that like don't go away.  And for some reason it's odd that they stay with you, uh, so vividly for so long.  But those are the things that made, if you hear the thing, it makes you who you are, makes  you who you are because then now the way to get the girl is make her laugh.  Is do this.  So that stuff kind of goes into making, that stupid, that big headed chick at the locker  who probably deserved it and the one who would have hated you after two dates anyway. 
[04:03:00]  Not talking to them did change the question.  That made you who you are.  You never would have been as funny as you are if you had that kind of self-esteem.  There would have been no need for you to be funny.  Guess so.  The girls liked you because you had cute hair?  You would have just relied on your stupid hairdo.  Just let him, let him vent though, man.  Of course not let him vent, but I mean, I relate to him.  It's finally, uh, he's finally venting, getting this, getting this out.  Yeah.  Getting all this crap out.  It's just, there's, I had an awful childhood.  Let's be honest.  There's so many stories like that, but I just, but I wanted to have a really good, fun childhood. 
[04:03:30]  So I did like with myself and a few friends and stuff.  Like I, I, I think of a lot of times that I enjoyed, I had a lot of fun growing up as  a kid.  Did you ever enjoy your dad?  But they were punctuated by, yeah, I enjoyed my dad a lot.  But with this reservation, with this impending doom feeling, uh, because it was just like  being around him was a lot of fun, but there was always this element of danger.  Like I always felt like, uh, I could be killed at any moment, either killed in a horrific 
[04:04:00]  drunken wreck or shot accidentally or starved to death or, uh, thrown from a horse.  There was always just this element of danger that he felt, um, in order to make me the,  the guy he wanted me to be, he had to put me through this training course that, uh, put  me on the brink of death many times.  So it was kind of odd, but I definitely enjoyed it.  Uh, 12 through 16 around those years. 
[04:04:30]  I was thinking of your dad when you were talking about that Thanksgiving display.  Mm-hmm.  How, how long did that last when, uh, when you brought it home?  Oh, who knows?  He was probably having sex with his gomar up in Connecticut.  What a matter.  Jesus.  What, what's the matter, Joey?  Uh, uh, because he, he used to fill, uh, vending machines.  That was his job.  Sure.  It's like, uh, uh, uh, where were you?  Oh, Connecticut.  I don't remember your roots being up in Connecticut.  I had to pick some stuff up. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, did you?  Why did it take two days?  Uh, Joey.  Don't think, don't think I'm stupid, Joey.  I know what's going on.  Shut up, bro.  Oh, I got a stomach ache.  Could you stop and tend to my tummy?  No, we can't.  Dad's having sex in Connecticut and mom's pissed.  You'd fake injuries to get love and stop the phone.  Oh, it was always a stomach ache.  I never had a new one.  I never had a new good one.  It was always, I got a stomach ache.  That's the worst.  No, you don't. 
[04:05:30]  That's the worst thing to tell a father, by the way, that you have a stomach ache.  I have a stomach ache.  You can tell your mom you got a stomach ache, but your father doesn't want to hear you got  that lame stomach ache thing.  It's a stomach ache.  Because men don't get stomach aches.  It was a tummy ache.  And he would turn around and go, you don't have a stomach ache.  And you wish you could just like project yourself as an adult into that kid to go, yeah, you're  right.  I don't.  I said I have a stomach ache because you two are ruining me. 
[04:06:00]  You're just yelling.  It doesn't end.  It doesn't stop.  Could you just leave each other so we can grow up in an environment not filled with hate?  There.  My stomach's fine.  Put the Pepto away, mom.  The stomach's fine.  You two are jackasses and you're destroying your children.  That was 30 some odd years ago.  You really should get over it.  Was it?  You really should just get over it. 
[04:06:30]  Well, I have a question.  Wow.  I want to ask.  It seemed like yesterday when I was saying it.  No kidding.  Now, you saw this girl after she smiled at you.  Did you see her in the hallway all the time and just be afraid to walk up to her?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't even make eye contact after that.  Well, that's normal crap, though.  Dude, it might be normal crap, but everybody's an individual.  So to me, it was like.  It's not normal.  And then there was.  What was her name?  Oh, my God.  Diane, I think, or Denise or something.  And she was in the apartment complex that I lived in in Central Islip. 
[04:07:00]  And we went down in the basement and kissed in the basement.  Yeah.  And I was like, wow, that's pretty cool, you know?  First time I ever did that with a girl, with a little girl.  And then she takes off.  And then I see her with this kid named Keith doing the same thing.  That's just normal crap.  You little slut, but it adds up.  Yeah, but it's normal crap to be scared to talk to a girl when you're growing up.  I used to follow this girl home from when I was in junior high. 
[04:07:30]  I had a massive crush on this girl.  I don't want to say her name.  I would follow her home.  I would keep my distance.  And it wasn't like I was stalking her because a lot of people walked home.  I want to know her name.  No way.  Why?  It's her first name only, of course.  But what's her name?  No, it's all right.  It's not Frank, is it?  No, it's not Frank.  And I was never brave enough to walk completely up to her.  I would keep my distance.  And the whole time, I'm like, come on, you could do it. 
[04:08:00]  I would have these conversations with myself.  You could do it.  And I would start walking a little faster.  I'd get a little closer.  Still pretty far away.  Still a couple hundred feet away.  And then I'd back off and have almost like a panic attack.  And I never told this girl how much I liked her.  Yeah.  Never did it.  But I followed her home for a long time.  See, you remember those things.  Oh, yeah.  And like Jimmy said, they all add up to make you the person you are.  But all that's normal crap.  We could do an hour on this.  Yeah, but I was constantly doing it.  It was a part of my personality that I couldn't make the move. 
[04:08:30]  I had no confidence as a kid to interact with girls in that way.  You didn't want to confront anything because of your parents.  Well, maybe, but I just didn't have any confidence.  And I think that was from growing up in that household environment.  It was probably not the most conducive to building a child's confidence.  Oof.  All right.  We have to take our first break. 
[04:09:00]  No, we can't.  I'm in the middle of a crisis.  I want to hear more of this when we get back.  Oh, absolutely.  Jimmy, yeah.  Very interesting stuff.  Anthony is finally venting, and we'll continue with this.  I've vented about my stupid childhood for years.  No, it's a little different.  Oh, God.  You're like a 13-year-old kid today.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're having a nervous breakdown.  If I was like a 13-year-old kid, I'd be in the bathroom doing what 13-year-old kids do.  By the way, if you're going to have a nervous breakdown, make sure it's around.  Make sure it's around 730, because that's when we have our biggest audience. 
[04:09:30]  All right.  All right.  You will let us know if that lamb takes a look at your little display, won't you?  We got Kelly from Michigan.  She wants in on this discussion.  Is it a she?  I don't know.  Kelly.  But Kelly Leak wasn't.  Kelly.  Good morning, guys.  Yes, it's a she.  She's a broad.  Hi, Kelly.  Hi.  What's up?  Hey, you know what?  I thought this was the Dr. Phil show.  The Dr. Phil show?  Yeah.  Did I tune into the wrong station?  Well, it's venting a little bit.  Possibly getting close to a nervous breakdown, I'm thinking. 
[04:10:00]  I don't think so.  I'm just kind of, you know, remembering and venting.  And not even, like, memories coming out of nowhere.  This is stuff I've remembered my whole life.  I look back fondly on a lot of it.  It's nostalgic.  It's very Wonder Years-ish.  But, you know.  I'm thinking how it still affects you.  So, like, you still get that feeling.  Like, you'll think about that girl looking at the thing.  And that smile still means something.  Oh, it was so sweet and nice. 
[04:10:30]  I was thinking about, you know, the girl I would follow home during the break.  And as soon as we went to commercial, I told Jimmy the name.  And then I realized, why didn't I just say the name on the radio?  Yeah.  Her name's, well.  I'm still scared to say it.  Well, no.  Her first name's Ann.  But, because I think it brings you right back.  Like, oh, my gosh, she might be listening.  Oh, jeez.  I could give a crap.  I got a call.  I could give a crap about this girl I used to follow home.  But it brought me right back, because Anthony had reminded me of something. 
[04:11:00]  And I was scared to say her name, because I'm thinking she might be listening to the show.  And I don't want to know what she really thinks of me.  Oh.  It was 20-some-odd years ago, or whatever it was.  Just want to keep that in that time capsule, whatever it was.  Right.  Only when you follow it home.  Uh, like junior high.  Oh, you're older than, like, seven, right?  Okay.  You're like, 13.  Oh, no.  I was, like, 13.  She followed her home last week.  Yeah, last week.  Right.  I follow her kids home now.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[04:11:30]  All right, Kelly.  Thank you.  You can have...  Yeah, it is time to get over it.  Oh, I'm...  You know something?  The truth of the matter is, I'm really over a lot of stuff.  It's just, um...  There are kids that went through a hell of a lot worse than I did.  These are just...  These are just childhood moments.  Like Ope said, a lot of kids go through the same things.  But it affects you, and kind of...  Not so much now.  You're not sitting there now, still freaking out over anything. 
[04:12:00]  But it kind of made you who you were.  You kind of bounced off of these events when you were growing up, and all through your life,  you bounce off these events, and it kind of guides you down whatever path you end up  at the end of.  And, you know, those little moments are one thing.  And it was directly because I didn't have any confidence to go out and really, you know,  assert myself and say, hey, I'm sorry that idiot hit your head on the locker, you know. 
[04:12:30]  Let me rub the bump on your head.  You could rub the bump in my...  If it's any consolation, hold on to it.  The guys that would have walked up to her and comforted her or smiled back and went,  oh, I'm glad you like my little project.  And there are plenty of kids like that.  None of them are funny.  Yeah.  Almost none of them could make anybody laugh.  It's a total lack of confidence.  That you just have to start making stupid jokes.  It is a desperate reach for love.  It's a plea for attention. 
[04:13:00]  Of course it is.  It's like, this is what I have to give you here, here.  But you know what?  35 years later or whatever, it's better to have that than a stupid high school football  jacket, which you would have gotten.  Who cares?  Talking over the glory days, I ran for 65 against Central.  Bunch of douches.  So good for you not to say hi to her and tell you who you are.  Central!  Jimmy puts things in such great perspective.  Remember the big win over Central! 
[04:13:30]  Look, man, it's weird.  It's like, when I think of the girl that I liked when I was a kid, I still have a feeling  for her, but I don't picture her as an adult.  I picture her as a third, fourth, and fifth grader.  Like, I had that little pic image of her, like, in the school picture, and that's how  you think.  So yeah, it's still very affecting.  Yeah.  There was a girl that I really had a huge crush on growing up, and I did try, and she  wouldn't give me the time of day.  And then you fast forward many, many years, and I'm at a high school reunion, and this 
[04:14:00]  girl is completely following me around the entire time, loving my ass.  Loving my ass because of who I am now.  I was like, you know what?  She wants the Hugh's fortune.  I'm like, you know what?  Go F yourself.  And I...  Yeah, reunion.  Go F yourself.  How old were you when you liked her?  Honestly, from kindergarten all the way from most of high school. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, okay.  I would keep going back to this one girl, like, wow, man.  And we, you know, when we were in kindergarten and in grammar school, we would talk.  We'd go to each other's house.  You know, nothing big.  No kisses.  None of that.  Never got to that.  But always had something for her.  And man, when I went to this high school reunion a few years back, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I'm like, get lost.  You don't think I see this coming? 
[04:15:00]  Do you know that it's how it affects you this?  I was kind of in love with this girl when I was in fourth and fifth grade, whatever.  And now I look back on it, and I realize that she didn't like me as much as I liked her.  And I remember going to her house one time, and we were going to hang out.  And then her and my friend kept going down to the basement, and they're like, just wait up here.  So I was like, okay.  And I waited up there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Years later in high school, he told me, like, yeah, that day she and I were downstairs making out.  And I got... 
[04:15:30]  This is, you know, it was years later.  I got so angry.  I didn't tell him I got angry.  I knew that made me a kook.  But I was, like, so angry.  And it's like, I don't trust women.  And it's probably why.  You were just...  The one girl I really liked, all of a sudden...  I never want to be the guy that doesn't know.  Right.  Like, the guy that's like, oh, my God.  I thought...  I never want to be the guy that has the revelation and realizes he's been made a fool of.  Right, right.  And I look back, and that day...  God, you were innocent, Jimmy, and she's downstairs basically losing her virginity, or what would  be your virginity at that age.  Oof.  A stupid non-kissable chapped lips. 
[04:16:00]  So that's not crazy stuff.  No, it really isn't.  There's one more of these hard little stories of no confidence or anything and not being  able to see my hand in front of my face.  Before I left to go to California, I'd been living in Huntington, right behind Fred's  Diner over there.  Oof, knows where that is.  And there was this girl, Leanne.  Me and Leanne were buddies from the time I moved in there as a kid, growing up into like, 
[04:16:30]  you know, pre-teen-dom, kind of junior high-ish age around there.  And before I went to California, I was like, all right, take it easy and stuff.  We'd always hung out, and I was really just in love with this girl.  And then I went to California, and I get a letter from her, and it's just her writing, I can't  believe you left.  I'm so in love with you.  And she was circling where her tears were hitting the page as she was writing. 
[04:17:00]  And I'm like, I'm an idiot.  I'm 3,000 miles away now.  So I'd have, like, you know, I'd have stayed in New York, probably, if it was, if I knew  how this girl felt.  And we hung out, like, every day.  Well, did you like her like that?  Yes!  But we hung out all the time, but I was just an inept, complete lack of confidence douche  who couldn't see, like, what was going on. 
[04:17:30]  I thought we were friends, and I never wanted to make that next step because I didn't want  the rejection, or I just didn't have the courage to do it.  It's just, you know, an ass.  How old were you and showed you that letter?  Uh, 30?  No, no.  It's always funny to say you're older.  I know.  It makes you seem silly.  I love exaggerated humor.  Probably 12 or something like that.  When's the next time you saw her after that? 
[04:18:00]  Oh, man, when I came back from California, and then forget it, you know, everybody's just  having their own good time and off on their own ways, and it was, you know, completely  over something.  But my mother told me, she goes, Leanne came to, because when I was on the phone with my  mother from California, and she goes, Leanne came to the door and asked where you were,  and I told her you were in California, because I told her I was going, but I guess I didn't  say the day or anything like that.  And then I left.  And she goes, and she just started crying.  I was like, oh, that's odd. 
[04:18:30]  And then I got the letter.  My baby, she wrote me a letter.  Wait, did you ever see Leanne?  I have to know what happened to Leanne.  Yeah, I saw Leanne after that, because I came back from California, moved into the same  neighborhood, but I was at the same house.  Tell you the truth.  She still lived, like, across the street.  I moved into the same house after I came back from California, went to the same school,  and I come walking in, and there's a big difference between 12 and 16.  So I came walking in, and people were kind of like, I think I know this guy, but I'm 
[04:19:00]  looking around going, I know you.  I know everything about this person.  I know this.  So I'm kind of walking around, because I disappeared from the face of the earth for a few years,  according to these people.  But they were different people, too.  You know, they were all older.  And yeah, I kind of picked up with old friendships, but for the most part, just made new friends.  Leanne, I kind of talked to her and stuff, but she was in her own crowd.  She ended up being, like, very hot, so she hung out with the hot girls, and perished  the thought.  I approached them. 
[04:19:30]  I'd rather stand in the back hall in my army jacket, smoking pot with guys, wondering why  there are no girls around us.  Where's Leanne now?  I don't know.  You don't want to know?  I don't know.  Can I be honest with you?  Where's Leanne?  You don't want to know where these girls are now.  No, probably not.  I think it helps sometimes, though, to kind of not feel bad about it anymore.  You look at them now, and you go, oh, yeah.  They're middle-aged women heading toward menopause.  Let's be honest with each other.  We have these memories of what they used to look like and what they used to do for you. 
[04:20:00]  I don't want to know where these broads are.  No, I'm saying that's good with regret, though.  If you have regret, if you look at them now, it's like, ah, how can I regret that?  Look at you.  You're a pig.  Look, we got everyone fooled.  They think we're in our late 20s, early 30s.  Oh, really?  Some of the girls we dated are heading toward menopause at this point.  It's right over the hill.  It's right around the bend.  I got it. 
[04:20:30]  There was this girl.  I mentioned it recently on the show when we were talking about long-distance relationships,  and I just am convinced they just don't work whatsoever because I had one when I was going to Geneseo  with this girl.  She lived in Utica, and we wrote letters all summer long back and forth with each other.  I got a stack.  I just remember this.  A stack of letters from her still tied up in a bow or something at my mom's house.  I'm going to bring them in, and I'm going to read a letter or two.  Oh, yeah.  Because now, knowing what I know, as she's writing these letters, she went back out with 
[04:21:00]  her ex, who was the star football player for Central!  Central!  She was banging him all summer long while she's writing me these awesome, like, romantic letters.  So now I got to bring these in and read them on the air.  Wait, did she circle other things on the paper?  Right.  It's where he hit my back, and it fell on the paper.  Oh, she played it perfectly.  She wrote nice things. 
[04:21:30]  She quoted lyrics from hot songs of the day and perfume on the letters, all that stuff.  And then I find out, like, you know, later on that the whole time she was banging her  ex, who was the quarterback of Central.  Central!  He was behind her, and her face was pressed into the paper so hard, it looked like the  Shroud of Turin.  Right, right.  She must really love me.  Speaking of not trusting women, because now I just assume, like, they're naked together,  and I was the joke the whole time, where the guy's like, oh, here, write this, write this. 
[04:22:00]  Like, they're writing the letters together, because I was so effing gullible, I guess.  I will bring them in and read them on the air.  That'll be fun.  Definitely.  That would be fun, knowing, you know, what I know and what the listeners know.  That'll make some chills.  I wish I would have saved, like, letters and things, but too embarrassing.  There was a girl that broke up with me that I wrote a letter to, and you don't realize  until later how just, how completely impossible it would have been to get that girl back. 
[04:22:30]  Like, it was just over, you know?  She had moved on, and you are just a distant memory.  But you think there's this chance if you write this nice, like, letter or something, and  it was just, ugh.  Just talking about how, you know.  Hoping she'll forget that you had sex with her best friend.  No, it was even like, yeah.  No, it wasn't anything like that.  What was the over moment?  It was just like, you know, it was that, it's that time when they just decide, you know, 
[04:23:00]  or you decide, eh, you're just going to leave.  Yeah.  It's done.  You know, you're early teens.  You're in school.  It's those school relationship things.  And then they just find someone else, you know?  One day they'll walk down the hallway and go, ah, okay, I'll go out with him.  And then you're just left there.  So you write your little letters.  But we're so made for each other.  Made for each other?  What?  At 14?  I'm not even completely made yet.  Yeah, I'm not even cooked. 
[04:23:30]  I'm made for each other.  Made.  I'm not made.  This thing still needs a few parts.  Still has some ingredients.  Right.  But you know what?  When you look at this low self-esteem and not talking to a girl,  then you look back at the times you talked to them and shouldn't have.  Like, my self-esteem being low was justified.  When I was in high school, I liked this girl, Michelle.  I loved her.  And I couldn't ask her out.  But I finally had the courage.  I looked her up in the phone book.  Oh.  And I called her.  And I was like, hey, it's Jimmy.  And she's like, hi.  And I'm like, you don't want to go out with me, do you? 
[04:24:00]  Oh, there's some confidence.  She actually was kind of nice.  She's like, no, I don't think so.  But she wasn't hateful about it.  Yeah.  Well, you put her in a great position.  And I think I told you this.  I tried to be careful.  I was like, well, that's the way the ball crumbles.  Like, I tried to be funny.  Oh, by mixing them up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thinking she'd go, oh, wait, on the other hand, you're funny.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Plenty of just embarrassing, douchey moments. 
[04:24:30]  My low self-esteem was telling me the truth.  All right.  Now that we got therapy out of the way, we're going to start the Opie and Anthony show after  the break.  That's true.  We're all in our periods.  Yeah.  We're going to.  Like, waiting to exhale in a half a circle.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't know what the f*** we're doing.  All right.  We got finger 11 in the studio.  We can hear you.  Is that mic?  Did you try the mic?  Are we set up or?  It's supposed to be working.  Can you hear me at all? 
[04:25:00]  A little bit.  Can you hear me only a little bit?  Yeah.  You're picking up on the other mics, I think.  Yeah.  How about now?  That doesn't sound good at all.  Is there a way he can get him a different mic?  That doesn't sound right.  Anything work?  Does anything work?  Play a guitar or something.  Just hit the.  That's sort of hearing that a little bit.  That's coming.  That one.  Shut your mics off for one second and see if you hear these mics at all.  All right.  Just a radio show.  All right.  Go.  One, two, three, four.  I knew this would happen.  We didn't expect this to work. 
[04:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  And this is not embarrassing at all to have, like, a really big band in looking at us.  No, it's not.  Like, we're just douches.  But it was working.  What the hell?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, your fucking hands are really busy.  Keep it up.  Suck on me.  Suck me.  Come on.  Come on.  Suck the shimmy.  Oh, honey, please do.  Hey, baby, this is heaven. 
[04:26:00]  They go ahead and force it in.  Oh, you sure as hell are a born coxman.  Oh, I love it this way.  Oh, it's great when the water swishes in my gut.  Oh, that's right.  Squeeze my tits and twist them.  Oh, shove your tongue down my goddamn throat.  Oh, Christ, what a fuck.  Oh, I'm getting ready to come, honey.  Oh, so am I, lover.  You beautiful bastard.  So am I.  Put your hands under the cheeks of my ass and grab my tit in your teeth. 
[04:26:30]  Now stand up.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Now slip and crack your head on the edge of the fucking bathtub.  A little too many instructions there.  Yeah, she's really giving a lot of orders.  Holy shit.  Now right hand green.  I read your book, you magnificent bastard.  Stop eating rib bones while you're fucking me.  Because that's the sound.  It's like it's awful.  It's fucking.  She's playing with click clacks.  Jesus.  Let's play jacks while you're fucking me, my asshole. 
[04:27:00]  Hey, jacks.  Awful sound effects.  Hand me my geritol, you dumb bastard.  All right.  Go back to that.  Yeah.  Get in your teeth.  Now stand up.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I feel that pick of yours all the way up.  Oh, baby.  I think it's coming up, my asshole.  Pump water.  I think I'm coming.  Oh, God.  There's no way he came already. 
[04:27:30]  I'll tell you why.  Yeah.  Porno, the guy's nut.  The scene's over.  Yeah.  There's not.  He comes, eats the shit out of her, and then goes, I need a bath.  And they go at it again, monster style.  Yeah.  Even though I know it's on audio, but there's just no way you do that in porn.  I don't think you did either.  Porn elevates as you go on.  And there's no fucking way he ate, come out of her pussy, came, and then they go at it 
[04:28:00]  again with this old, cummy bitch.  Yeah.  Like, he should go home and go, what did I just do?  With these complicated instructions of hers.  Jesus.  Old, cummy bitch.  That's what she is.  Oh, why should Mike come out of her twat while I'm licking it?  This woman sounds like Angry Vince.  That's it.  Eat my asshole.  Now eat it.  You're going to grab my ass cheeks.  That's it.  Now stick a thumb up my ass.  Yeah.  All right.  Now I'm going to suck that prick, and I'm going to suck it good. 
[04:28:30]  You're going to, oh, you like that, don't you?  You're going to come?  All right.  Stand up.  Now bite my tits.  You bite those tits.  Now take your thumb and shove it in my ass.  Shove it in.  That's right.  Shove it in my ass.  What do you mean you're tired?  You better not get tired.  You got fucking to do.  Now start fucking.  Angry Vince.  That bitch is pissed. 
[04:29:00]  You better not get tired.  I want you to clean the cum out of my cunt.  That's it.  Clean the cum out.  Ooh, yeah.  That's right, baby.  Grab my ass cheeks.  Grab them.  Spread them.  Look directly in my ass and start licking.  That's right.  Lick my ass. 
[04:29:30]  No.  Hey, it's Opie from Opie and Anthony, and that does it for us.  We're done.  Go find someone else to entertain.  Yeah, we're done.  Ron and Fez.  Yeah, they're up next.  All right.  Hooray.  On the virus.  XM202.  Sirius 197. </pre>
