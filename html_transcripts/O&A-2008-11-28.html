<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment dissecting clips from *Lost in Space*, focusing on their belief that Dr. Smith was a pedophile, using homophobic and sexually suggestive language to describe his behavior and appearance.  They also discussed a rumor that Will Robinson, the child actor, later appeared in pornography, leading to a broader discussion about child actors entering the adult film industry and a mention of the song "Fishheads." This transitioned into a discussion of the logistical nightmare surrounding the annual "Homeless Shopping Spree," severely hampered by a Reverend Al Sharpton-led protest march causing significant traffic delays.  The hosts used racial slurs and offensive language expressing their frustration.

The show then shifted to live coverage of the "Homeless Shopping Spree 2006" at the Short Hills Mall.  Listeners at the mall reported massive crowds and chaotic scenes. The hosts interviewed several homeless participants on the bus, including Papa Rock (who received a guitar), Gray Wolf (who performed a song and sold a record), and Fez from the Ron and Fez Show (participating ironically).  Other participants included Blue, Red, and Tippy Tom, whose frequent offensive language was noted.  Rich Voss performed stand-up comedy for the participants on the bus. The crowd's behavior, including inappropriate yelling, was also discussed. The hosts also promoted their XM radio commercial and upcoming television spots.

Further updates from the mall came from various callers, including Rich Voss, Keith ("the cop"), and others describing the overwhelming crowd's reactions.  Homeless participants were introduced as they exited the bus, with reports of listeners donating extra money and some participants buying expensive items.  Poor audio quality was frequent due to the large and excited crowd.  Minor incidents, such as a dropped phone and a lowered gate at Foot Locker, were mentioned. This segment highlighted the chaotic energy and unusual shopping choices of the participants, with this spree being labeled the largest to date.

The broadcast continued to follow the spree, focusing on specific purchases like a $250 leather jacket and $175 sneakers, with "Half a Hulk Face" becoming a recurring focus. Numerous callers, identified by nicknames or names (Danny, Ron, Voss, Steve C., Sam, Nurse Heather, Black Earl, Roland, Mike, etc.), provided updates on the ongoing chaos and reactions of mall shoppers and staff.  The mall closed an entrance to manage the crowd.  The successful photo of "Half a Hulk Face" with Santa was discussed.  The segment concluded with the group leaving the mall, a comedic song ("Homeless for the Holidays") featuring the homeless participants was played, and listeners expressed their gratitude.

The post-spree segment featured discussions on the bus ride back to New York, with Steve C., Kenny, Elmo, Fez, and Danny among those contributing.  The overwhelming positive fan turnout was noted, alongside negative interactions with Gap employees. Several contributors described some participants as lazy and more interested in drinking.  An anecdote detailed a black participant spending $80 on an inflatable neck pillow.  Significantly, Gray Wolf's emotional reunion with his son after 27 years was highlighted. The segment ended with a rambling and erratic phone call from Andrew Dice Clay, claiming to be at Ground Zero, making nonsensical statements about historical events and having a seeming nervous breakdown on air.  A brief attempt was made to connect him with Barry Williams.

A subsequent segment focused on a lengthy, rambling, and nonsensical phone call from Andrew Dice Clay, described as a "nervous breakdown," interweaving jokes about historical events and tragedies.  Christopher Titus, an in-studio guest, reacted to the call's absurdity. This transitioned into a highly inappropriate and graphic prank involving Bob Kelly’s phone and Pat from Munaki.  The conversation shifted to a discussion about Rich Voss’s pornography preferences, leading to sexually graphic descriptions and offensive language regarding the hosts' and callers' preferences.

The show concluded with a sexually explicit song, "Sexy Vag to Steve the Bear," followed by a vulgar conversation between the hosts and Charlie about the relative attractiveness of vaginas, including graphic descriptions and jokes about sex and body odor.  A brief mention of Dennis Leary listening to the show and a promotional announcement ended the broadcast.

[00:02:30]  You're listening to the worst 
[00:03:00]  You're listening to the worst  Not the best  All of it is so bad  It's hard to tell  Which is the worst  The absolute worst  And you're listening to the worst  And you're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  The worst of Opie and Anthony  It's absolutely awful  All right, what do you guys want to do next? 
[00:03:30]  Got a bunch of stuff to get to  We got the Lost in Space clips  We've been obsessed with this for many years  As a matter of fact  Young boys  We actually had  What was his name?  Jonathan Harris?  Yeah  Jonathan Harris  We had him on our show 
[00:04:00]  Back at N.E.W.  Remember that?  I sure do  And he's another one that over the two years  That we were off  Dropped dead  Dr. Zachary Smith  From Lost in Space  For years  God, from the time we hooked up  To do radio  We've been goofing on the fact that  He really comes off like a pedophile  On Lost in Space  With young William  There you had Penny  Who was the sister 
[00:04:30]  And then Judy  Who was like the big blonde  On the show  Big torpedo tits  She had on her  A hot piece of ass  Major West though  Was I think having sex with her  But  Dr. Smith never gave them a look  Young Penny  And Judy  Nothing  Barely talked with the adults  The adults would have nothing to do with him  Because he was just a screw up  He would always try to sabotage things  And he was always wrecking things  No one ever had a conversation with Dr. Smith 
[00:05:00]  It was just him talking with the young boy  Young William  Constantly going out on little outings  You know, everybody else  They'd land on some planet  And the rest of the crew  You know, the father there  And Don West  Would go out and do whatever they had to do  Yeah  They would work  Collect food for the family  Work on the spaceship a little bit  Yeah, the ladies would set up the hydroponic garden  And start getting some food together for them 
[00:05:30]  The guys would repair the ship  Or go out and see if they could find  Some kind of supplies that they need  And Dr. Smith  What was he doing?  Just roaming around  Climbing rocks with Will  Looking around  William, come with me  Looking for monsters  Looking for monsters, oh dear  And hoping that the rain would come  Little game of monster rain  Under the Jupiter 2  Yes  Incidentally, that is where Jimmy Robinson's last name came from  Right 
[00:06:00]  From Will Robinson  From Will Robinson  You named him Jimmy Robinson  Because you thought Will Robinson was pretty cool  Cool, yeah  Because he hung out with an old man  I don't remember  Wow, this is  This whole thing is getting deeper  I didn't know that  Young Jimmy Norton, come with me  Oh dear  Oh dear  Oh dear  Come with me, Jimmy Norton  And for some reason  The family had no problem with this  Sending Will off with Dr. Smith  Who pretty much almost got the entire family killed 
[00:06:30]  On a weekly basis  But I guess all was forgiven by the end of the episode  You play the music  Come on, Smith  Back in the ship, Smith  Instead of leaving him out there, you know  Hog-tied  And invite him back in  So they could land on another planet  And he could romp around with their young son  Again  So we're slowly but surely going through all the clips of the show 
[00:07:00]  Yeah  How many years was it on?  Those shows back in the 60s  Were only on just a couple seasons  Yeah  It just seems like they were on forever  Not that long  But they pumped out a lot of episodes back then too  So we got like 10 really quick clips here  The first one is just overacting  Yeah, it's just the way he ran around like a faggot  And it's weird  If you watch the first couple of episodes of Lost in Space  The mood is a lot darker  And it's not as camp and zany 
[00:07:30]  You know, and Dr. Smith isn't this over-the-top Kansas City faggot  That he turns into by the later part of the show  He's very evil  Very dark and sinister  And he was there to sabotage the Jupiter 2  And then by the middle of this  Not even the middle of the run  It was still like kind of the beginning of the run  They thought for some reason  To just make him this over-the-top fag  Flamboyant  A queen  And he just runs around yelling and screaming  Like this 
[00:08:00]  Help me, dear  I'm Wade Steen up here  Hurry up, Penny  I'm stuck  Penny  Hurry up, dear  Help!  What is he stuck in?  Help!

[00:20:30]  Crush, kill, destroy  And he picked up big rocks  And would squish them  And the episode where  Dr. Smith got all strong  And he was able to crush rocks  I think my favorite one  Was the one where they  Was it the robot got real big  Or the family got real small  I don't remember  And they had to crawl inside the robot  And take a big journey through them  And at the end they were gonna get real big  Again so they had to get out of the robot  Before they grew  Or else they'd get squished inside there or something  That was a good one 
[00:21:00]  Alright, another example of Dr. Smith being gay  Yes  Hi Doctor  William  What a delightful surprise  Where have you been keeping yourself?

Please get me a Turkish towel  The worst, worst, worst, worst of Opian Anthony  Ugh  I wouldn't order this shit either  You suck  Opian Anthony  The virus is spreading  If this doesn't make you want to throw up 
[00:26:30]  The failure  The most annoying thing on two legs  What a war fest  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee  Opie  Oh, do you wanna play?  Anthony  I will beat children about the head  Jim Norton  I'm dancing  I'm dancing  I'm just...  I'm a naked whore  It's indescribable  I'm trying  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for  Ha! Ha!  Why are you crying? 
[00:27:00]  The virus finally hit him  But with Jimmy you never know  It could be AIDS  No!  Yes, yes  It's the Opian Anthony show  The virus that spreads from town to town across the USA  This is the day  And...  I hate you  I hate you  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:27:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Welcome to the homeless shopping spree 2006.  Anthony already pissed off.  Jimmy, just arriving as I turn on all our mics.  It's, what's the word here in New York City?  Chaos.  A bit crowded. 
[00:28:00]  A bit crowded.  A bit dark.  It's a bit dark in Midtown.  I am livid.  Livid.  I heard nothing of this.  This Reverend Al protest march.  Down Fifth Avenue.  I had to drive in from Long Island.  The drive was very pleasant.  Right up until I got across the 59th Street Bridge onto 57th Street in Manhattan. 
[00:28:30]  Where I was then turned off of 57th.  Now, I don't know how much everybody else can understand.  Here in New York, you can if you work or live in the city.  When you're on 57th and they close it down and you get turned off.  57th is a main thoroughfare across town.  The rest of the streets are these double-parked, single-lane crappy roads that get packed crowded with traffic. 
[00:29:00]  And the reason that 57th was closed?  Because Reverend Al had to have a march.  Today.  Today, down Fifth Avenue, where all the white people shop for Christmas.  And completely tie up this effing city.  Why can't they tell him no?  That's what I said.  In between the use of the N-word, every third word out of my mouth.  I set a personal record today.  Which I'm very proud of. 
[00:29:30]  Yelling it out the window.  In the car, just with the windows rolled up to myself.  Well, I know the old record is 851 in one day.  Blew it away.  Blew it away.  And in record time.  Yeah.  I was just livid.  So, I get turned off of 57th.  And when you're, you know, driving down and you plan and you're timed out what time you're going to get here.  And I have to be here by a certain time.  It's my job.  You know people.  You know jobs. 
[00:30:00]  That's places you have to be to make money on a daily basis.  Dad, I'm just filling in some people that probably don't have them.  When you're on 57th and get turned off of it, you know it's going to tack another at least 45 minutes to an hour on wherever the hell you're going.  Well, this city is a fine organism.  And if you block off one street.  Yep.  I mean, if one car stalls, the whole city's effed.  The city gets screwed.  They have it to a point.  Driving around in Manhattan. 
[00:30:30]  Yep.  One car stalls or they block off one road.  Everybody's screwed.  It doesn't matter how far you're away from this roadblock or this stalled car.  The ripple effect happens.  The ripple effect is ridiculous in Manhattan.  And just to explain, because people are a little clueless here.  Yeah, Reverend Al decided today to get, I don't know, thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people.  Thousands of black people.  Together to protest what happened there in Queens a few weeks back.  The shots, the groom getting shot.  I understand.  That was a tragic event.  Let the judicial system take care of it. 
[00:31:00]  Let a grand jury take care of it.  Let people investigate it and see what happens.  And if then you don't get the answer you want, then do what you usually do.  F-ing riot.  Okay?  Let's keep things the way they usually work in this world.  But while they're still doing the investigation, could you let Whitey shop?  Let Whitey shop!  Let Whitey shop!  Let Whitey shop! 
[00:31:30]  You're tying up Fifth Avenue.  Was there a lot of traffic when you were veered off it?  It's like you couldn't believe.  It's a nightmare out there.  And how does that pertain to today besides the fact that Anthony is out of his freaking mind?  We're trying to get together this homeless shopping spree, 2006, and the bus is stuck in a roadblock.  The homeless, we can't dig up all the homeless we wanted to because we can't get around the city to pick them up.  Yeah, the homeless are not where they usually are because those streets are blocked off for the march. 
[00:32:00]  Like, here's something.  We can't find Andrew from the kick-stopping incident.  Goddamn Led Zeppelin, he is.  He's the who of this event.  He is the star of this year's homeless shopping spree, 2006.  Of course, the guy where he offered us a cake.  I jumped on his cake.  Everyone knows the bit by now.  Well, he's usually outside a church on Fifth Avenue.  Fifth Avenue is the street that is completely closed down for this protest.  Because Reverend Al's got to march.  So then we got a hot tip that Andrew is wandering around Central Park. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that's an easy park to try to find someone in?  On a Saturday when it's unseasonably warm out in New York City.  Central Park is, I don't know, if I had to do a quick guess, 20 square miles.  Ah, we'll find him.  Yeah, we'll find him.  We'll find Andrew.  He's in there somewhere.  And then Tippy Tom, we can't find him.  Can't find Tippy.  All because Reverend Al had a march.  Today.  Leave your stupid marches.  You know what your marches do?  Nothing.  Let me make this clear.  Everyone's outraged at what happened. 
[00:33:00]  Let the judicial system run its course.  Your marches do nothing but make people hate you.  They make people hate you.  And by people, I mean white people.  It makes prejudice even more.  It makes people more prejudice.  Michael Richards, I made a turn.  He heard what I was yelling.  He was offended.  He told me to stop.  I was offending people.  Yeah, they're not getting any sympathy today, man. 
[00:33:30]  And everyone got it from me today.  And all the news stations are on it now.  All live shots of this march.  Because they have continued marching past where our location is, 57th Street.  And they're going all the way downtown.  And then what?  Then they're going to start coming all the way back?  Well, they got to get back.  They don't live down there.  That's for sure.  You know where they came from?  Up north.  You know, we should get them back and just shut down the subways.  Oh, my God.  No, please. 
[00:34:00]  Let them take the subways and get back home.  All right.  Giuliani was great.  He gave Al Sharpton nothing.  Nothing.  He gave Sharpton.  Why did Bloomberg give these people permits to march?  Guilty.  Why on a Saturday afternoon do you give them a Fifth Avenue permit to march?  A Fifth Avenue permit.  This is about when people do their Christmas shopping.  Fine.  You know something?  The guy is so gung-ho about revenue in this city.  He's completely effing up the revenue.  Because if he didn't, he'd catch all kinds of hell, I guess. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, this time of year, it's a zoo in Manhattan to begin with.  And then on top of it, this march going on.  Forget it.  Stop it already with your stupid marches.  They don't do anything.  But let's stay focused.  They're not garnering sympathy.  They're making people hate you.  Let's stay focused, though.  We're here to do the homeless shopping spree 2006.  And I guess what we're trying to tell you guys, it's a complete nightmare so far.  Where's the bus?  The bus?  I don't know.  We're going to start getting some updates.  Keith, the cop, I just saw him running around.  He looks completely exhausted already.  He called me like, dude, I don't even know what to do. 
[00:35:00]  Like, he was stuck behind roadblocks, and he works for the NYPD.  Keith's on a cell phone.  He's walking over to a microphone.  Keith, what do you got?  A mess.  I mean, this was a mess.  I've been out there three hours running around looking for these guys.  And to not have the two stars of the show.  I mean, we have Tippy Tom's understudy, Big Red.  He was in rare form today.  He is in rare form?  He's grabbing other guys in the van. 
[00:35:30]  Blue is in the van, and Blue's drunk, and they're back and forth with each other.  Not drunk, I'm sorry.  Yeah, we're not allowed to get the homeless drunk.  That's a story for another day.  Look, I don't know what the hell these guys did before.  It's frigging, you know, it's in the afternoon.  What do you think?  These guys go, hey, it's not noon yet.  Who said he can't buy him liquor?  We all got the email.  Just wait for the email.  Just wait for the emails that were sent out the last couple of days.  This issue will come up Monday.  Yeah, we will be strangling a lawyer in Washington. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We will be getting Joel Hollander involved on this one.  Holy crap.  Wait till we, you know, get into that.  Just completely trying to destroy the homeless shopping spree less than a day before we do it.  It's what they do.  It's what they do.  They're not creative.  They are just ruining the business that they are supposed to be helping.  The lawyers are there to just screw things up.  You're ruining the business you're supposed to be protecting.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, so where are we at, Keith?  All right.  Well, we got half of the guys that we know and love, and then we have... 
[00:36:30]  Actually, we still have a good lineup because we're going to go to the mall in a second because  the mall is already crazy.  We'll get an update from the Short Hills Mall.  That's where this bus with the homeless people are heading to in about, I don't know,  about a half hour from right now, but the list I got in front of me, we got Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf we have, yeah.  The guitar player?  You have him?  We got...  I'm running down the list here.  We got Gray Wolf.  We got David, who's the homeless guy from WYSP in Philly.  They brought a homeless guy up from Philly.  He's here.  We got Big Red, who Keith has said is Tippy Tom's understudy. 
[00:37:00]  Understudy.  We got the Big Red.  We got Blue.  He's very famous in past homeless shopping sprees.  We got Papa Rock, or a homeless guitar dude, who was fiddling and fiddling and fiddling.  Does he have his guitar with him?  Yes, he does.  It's quite haggard.  Is it already all beat up?  I can't wait to see it.  We broke his old guitar.  We gave him a brand new one.  This thing was sweet.  Like how long ago did we give him this guitar?  It was Thanksgiving.  Three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago, and it's already just wrecked.  It's already beat up pretty bad.  We have half a Hulk face. 
[00:37:30]  Thank God.  And we have Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  Fez?  Yes.  Fez.  A couple people that we picked up along the way.  O-Head.  O-Head?  O-Head.  He's one of the crowd favorites over at the Port Authority.  Oh, no.  We picked up Big Pop.  Big Pop?  Who we're going to introduce today.  He's also another Port Authority fella.  Okay.  And for the first time, we have a female participant.  Oh. 
[00:38:00]  No, I think we had one last year.  No, we had her come up, but we never found her again.  Oh, okay.  She never, yeah.  Okay.  We have Annette.  Annette.  The Australian homeless girl.  Wow.  That's a long way from home.  So she's on halfway around the world to become homeless.  To become homeless.  But she's attractive?  At one point, she might have been.  Ah.  But I would like to do the thing, and we've done this a lot in the police department, where  you see somebody who maybe started getting into heroin, and you'll see over like a year's  time, maybe they get arrested 10 times or whatever. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, you'll look up their mug shots.  Right.  The deterioration in the mug shot from a really attractive girl to just a total crack.  Yeah.  I've seen some of those online.  Very interesting.  And we still have people trying to search out Andrew.  Yeah.  Andrew.  Oh, come on.  We need Andrew.  Oh, please, Andrew.  I mean, you know, Tippi Tom, we had the right off.  I spent a lot of time looking for him, and I hit the church on Fifth Avenue.  You hit all the places he hangs.  I hit every place for Andrew and Tippi Tom, and, you know, they could be downtown in the  tombs, for all we know. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, they might be arrested or in the hospital, or who knows.  All right.  Let's go to No Filter Paul.  He's at Short Hills Mall.  No Filter Paul.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Good afternoon.  I'm standing outside this Cordova Mexican restaurant.  On the south entrance to the Short Hills Mall.  Yeah.  And I'm standing with about 150 maniacs who are going to, in the south side, there's  about 100 people inside.  Let's go.  All right, then.  No Filter Paul's trying to organize the first chant, and it's not doing too well. 
[00:39:30]  No, he's not inspirational.  As you can hear.  No, he doesn't inspire anything.  Yeah, it sounds just like Reverend Allen, the marches doing.  Thank you, No Filter Paul.  Let's say hi to Navy Dan.  Navy Dan, what's up?  Yeah, actually, I'm in Udoba looking outside right now, and I see security guys all forming  up.  There was police that were driving by telling people to get out of the streets.  I got here a few hours ago.  I had, like, five pints with some of the pests.  People have no idea what's going on, just watching with their kids, seeing huge crowds 
[00:40:00]  form up.  This is very early on, too.  Wait until when they arrive.  It's just going to be a madhouse.  I got reports up to 300 to 400 people so far at Short Hills Mall waiting for the bus  to arrive.  And we got some pal talkers.  They're going to be at the mall with their cameras.  Yeah, apparently they're going to bring the cameras, so we're going to be able to watch  the arrival as it happens on that pal talk.  Also here, and there's a two-mile backup for the exit for the mall.  Of course.  Those are going to be, well, those are all the pests trying to get to the mall for the  homeless shopping spree.  So if you're on your way to the mall, give us a call. 
[00:40:30]  Let us know what's going on out there.  But I guess it's shaping up.  It's shaping up.  But it was just crazy about a half hour ago.  We didn't know if Anthony was going to make it to the studio.  We didn't think the bus was going to make it to the studio.  We didn't even think Keith was going to find half the guys he ended up finding.  That whole march through a monkey wrench into the whole thing.  Yeah.  If we could just get Andrew, then we're in very, very good shape.  I had to get out of a camp on Broadway and walk.  I've never had to do that.  I left it like 25 minutes up.  I'm like, eh, may hit a little extra traffic. 
[00:41:00]  I was stopped so bad where I opened.  I had to get out and walk.  When they turned me off of 57th and then turned me off onto another road, the traffic  ick, the traffic ick that directs traffic, the ones that want to be police officers,  but for some reason couldn't pass the test or something like that, so they put a little  vest on them and make them direct traffic, turned me off of the road, and I had to make  a left.  And as I'm making a left, there's a car not paying attention to the traffic person coming 
[00:41:30]  right at me.  So he jams on the brakes and gives me this, hey, what the hell are you making a left for?  So now the windows are down because I'm livid, and I yell out at him, that cop just told  me to turn A, you know, I gave him the A-H, and then I noticed pedestrians, I'm in the  crosswalk now because I'm chastising this driver.  Yes.  So a guy in the crosswalk goes, hey, move it. 
[00:42:00]  So now I'm looking right at him, and I go, hey, I go, that idiot over there told me to  make this turn.  And then I used the J-O, you J-O guy.  Yeah.  And he then said to, for me to F myself, and then as I gave him the same thing back, and  then as I drove past, he smacked my car with the palm of his hand, and I stopped and went  and gave him an Opie, I went, oh, you got me. 
[00:42:30]  And all it wound up doing probably was making his hands filthy, because I haven't washed  that truck in about six months, so it's filthy.  And then another guy, because, yeah, oh, oh, I was livid.  So this other guy in one of the livery cars that I get joy over when one of them are found  slumped over in their seat with a bullet to their head because they were robbed, not the  regular cab drivers, but the black cars, the livery cars.  Yeah, yeah.  He won't turn.  I want to make a left. 
[00:43:00]  Everything's open.  He's in front of me.  He's not turning, because they have to do paperwork as they drive.  So, bam, I give him the horn.  So there's this, I don't know what he was, Iranian, some type of culture that spawns terrorists,  was standing there with a stroller and a baby in the stroller.  And because I tooted the horn, he goes, why do you have to do that?  And my girlfriend flips him the bird from the passenger seat, and then he just shakes his  head. 
[00:43:30]  And I go, I have to do this because that savage isn't moving his vehicle.  And the only reason I'm here is because the, and then I blurted out the N word, are marching  and I have to drive down here.  And two feet away from him was this black guy who's now looking at me like, did I, did he  just, what the, did I just hear what he, dude, on all time record.  Way to garner sympathy, people.  Yeah, that's, you're not going to get the sympathy today.  I would love to see you in such a bad mood being scolded. 
[00:44:00]  That's the best part to me.  I was shocked.  And then someone has to yell at you in the crosswalk to hurry up.  Yeah, to hurry up.  Odin, I just want to gas it and run him over.  Hey, let's say hi to Sonny Ferelli.  Sonny Ferelli.  Hey, boys, what's happening?  What's up?  I'll tell you something.  And what is seen here is at the mall, there's about four, three, 400 people here.  And we've already been spoken to from the, from the cops, like about three times already 
[00:44:30]  from just a couple of people just taking it just a little bit too far.  Well, they're very excited.  I mean, if you're going to Short Hills Mall for the homeless shopping spree today, all  we ask is that you behave.  Our listeners have always done that.  Have a great time, but just behave in the end, please.  Have fun.  It's going to be a very enjoyable day.  It's a beautiful day out there.  And when the homeless arrive, the shopping, the excitement, it's going to be great.  People love it.  The arrival is the best part.  When that bus shows up and the crowd goes nuts, I can't wait for that. 
[00:45:00]  And for the most part right now, the cops are pretty much letting us stay, do our own  thing as long as, you know, we keep in order, you know.  So it's working out pretty good so far.  All right.  Thank you, Sonny Ferelli.  Now he's staying 400 people at the mall.  I mean, who knows?  Probably close to 400.  Jeff in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  I'm heading west on Route 24 and trying to get off 7C here.  And there's cars already in the shoulder heading towards the mall entrance.  This is crazy.  We're like a mile away.  Yeah, we need to do traffic reports, too, because people are trying to get to the mall for the 
[00:45:30]  arrival of the bus.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Take it easy.  People are bringing up things that happened in the past that we really need done.  The pictures with Santa.  Every mall has a mall Santa.  If we could get, just picture half a Hulk face on Santa's lap getting a picture taken.  How wonderful.  What a Christmas card.  I want to send that out as my Christmas card.  Last year, we had the homeless riding a carousel.  Remember?  We picked that mall that had a huge carousel inside. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, a big Christmassy carousel.  And they're all, the homeless are riding it.  And the children are fearful, running away, saying, Mommy, what's that smell?  Well, we're just about ready.  We're kind of stalling, hoping we can find Andrew at the last minute.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree without him this year.  We got my brother, Elmo, here.  Rich Voss is here.  Than is here.  Steve.  They're all heading to the mall to be spotters as the homeless shop.  Then again, we did tell that stupid cake bum to be somewhere.  And if he had the ability to be somewhere, he wouldn't be in the predicament he was in.  I know. 
[00:46:30]  We called him every day, Saturday.  Every day.  Okay.  We even tested him every day.  Okay.  Where are you supposed to be Saturday?  Now, you're going to be here Saturday.  All right?  Here.  I'll treat myself.  You dummy.  He missed out on some free hair.  Like, he's got satellite radio or a radio or anything.  In the office, I said, could someone call his cell phone?  Yeah.  Someone called his cell phone.  And only two people got the joke.  Everyone else was like, well, I don't know his number.  Do you?  His number?  I'm like, you idiots.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll take an early break here. 
[00:47:00]  Then we're going to talk to the homeless people.  Get them on the bus and get them on their way to Short Hills Mall.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  All right.  It's the homeless shopping spree 2006 on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  And now it's time for Getting to Know the Homeless with your host, Steve C.  Uh, you're going to a mall today.  We're going to give you some money.  You're going to go Christmas shopping.  What are you going to buy today at the mall?  Sneakers.  Sneakers.  Pants.  Pants. 
[00:47:30]  Underwear I don't have.  You're not wearing underwear right now?  No.  Stay tuned for another installment of Getting to Know the Homeless, here on the Opie and  Anthony Show.  Go get lost.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I was not happy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  This is homeless shopping spree 2006. 
[00:48:00]  Everyone's munching down on the sandwiches.  Me and Jimmy are eating the bum's food.  They brought in some sandwiches.  Yeah.  For the homeless.  And, uh, I hadn't eaten.  So I grabbed one of the turkey and cheese sandwiches.  And then Jimmy's like, oh, what are you eating?  I go turkey and cheese.  He goes, oh, let me grab one.  So, you know, better we eat than they do.  Isn't that fooling?  They're eating too.  They can eat out of anywhere.  They're eating.  We need good food.  Kenny, what's up?  They can't afford bread. 
[00:48:30]  Let them have garbage.  Big Blue was very excited to see opening.  He's very excited to see opening?  Opening.  All right.  Hey, Rich Voss is over here.  He's going to be one of the spotters at the mall.  Rich, what's up?  I just was in the room with him, and one guy went to shake my hand, and I pushed it up,  so he just grabbed the top right here.  Your forearm?  Yeah, my forearm.  You know, because I, yeah, yeah.  I'm just not sure.  Why was he disgusted at your little hands?  I don't.  He said, look at those midget fingers.  I'm not touching that.  Voss had the observation of the century. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, that's why we have you on the air.  That's what I'm telling you.  You're coming up with new material.  Who gives a crap?  I turned your mic on because you had something really good that you said to Jimmy when the mics weren't on.  Well, I was going to get into that.  I find it quite.  Holy crap.  All right, all right.  I got to set it up.  You don't break out with your best bit right from the beginning.  I just find it arrogant that you guys, you know, upset about the traffic, you know,  that they're protesting a guy that got shot a night before his wedding day to do your dumb little radio bit, okay?  Are you that self-centered that, oh, our radio bit is so important, stop everything? 
[00:49:30]  You know, well, let's have the protest on Monday or something?  I would go on record and say this bit, this radio bit is so much more important than that dumb protest.  Let Whitey shop.  Let Whitey shop.  Let Whitey shop.  Let Whitey shop.  All right, we got this douche that wants in.  John in Boston, what's up?  John.  Yeah, John.  Come on, John, you're on the radio.  John's already proven he's a moron because he doesn't understand he's on the air.  John, Boston, on the air. 
[00:50:00]  John is filing complaints with sponsors for this awful show that we're doing today.  John, come on.  You can say whatever you want on our show.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, then why aren't you talking?  You're on the air, you jackass.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I really don't talk to people who swear at me.  Goodbye.  Oh.  Oh, faggot.  You faggot.  Go listen to the Hillman.  You're obviously part of Mantown, you faggot.  Stop it.  I don't talk to people that curse. 
[00:50:30]  Curse.  Unless they're holding your ears and standing over you.  Exactly.  At least let us curse at you.  Yeah, we didn't even curse at them.  What's up, Keith?  All right, so everyone's having their quick lunch.  But for those scoring at home, we have a last-minute substitution.  Australian Annette got out of the van and took off running down the street like a lunatic.  And we have now replaced her with James, who was a last-minute substitution.  No, betting.  Who the hell is James?  We all got our scorecards.  All right, so we've got to cross out Annette.  Got to change it.  Annette's gone. 
[00:51:00]  She was the Australian woman.  All right.  She ran out of the van.  She would have been the first woman on the homeless shopping spree.  She got out of the van and just ran down the street in a panic.  She probably looked around in the van and realized, my God, I'm a bum.  And Keith said, like a lunatic.  We have James.  All right, James is the substitute.  So we got Gray Wolf.  We got David from Philly.  WYSP found David for us.  We got Big Red.  We got Blue.  We got Papa Rock, who's a homeless guitar dude.  We got Half a Hulk Face.  We got Fez from the Ron and Fez Show. 
[00:51:30]  O-Head.  Some new guys.  O-Head, Big Pop, and now James.  Notice how fast I'm eating?  I want this so done and digested before one of them make it into the studio.  Well, they're going to be in here in a second or two.  Oh, my God.  Hurry up.  Let's say hi to Patty in Jersey.  Patty, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  All right, Patty.  I'm at the mall right now.  Okay.  Well, where's the bus?  We're waiting for the bus.  Everybody's yelling around here.  I don't know the driver's coming by here. 
[00:52:00]  Is the crowd pretty good?  Yeah, it's good.  All right.  I'm yelling at everybody.  Well, we're just going to talk to the homeless real fast in the studio, and then they're  going to be on their way.  All right.  They are just out of their minds at the mall already.  What's up, Kenny?  I just got a call from Master Poe, who's on the scene at the mall.  Oh.  Yeah, go ahead.  Real fast, Kenny.  He's going to keep things in line at the mall.  All right.  As Kenny was trying to talk, the homeless have made their way into the studio. 
[00:52:30]  What's up, Blue?  How's your sandwich?  Finished.  All right.  Listen.  What?  Big Red, what's up?  All right.  Their mics aren't on.  Yeah.  Why would they be?  Why would their mics be on now that we...  I think their breath has melted the fine equipment.  Big Red, talk into that mic for me.  Testing, testing.  All right.  How you doing, Big Red?  Good, good.  You're right. 
[00:53:00]  How you doing, brah?  You don't know me, right?  I know you.  You're blue.  What?  You're blue.  I know blue.  I remember you from last year.  Testing, testing.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I knew this would happen.  Al Dukes is going to have his work cut out for him today.  This looks like an N.A. meeting.  Let me...  Thank God that mic isn't on because he will not stop.  All right.  Let's try to control this for a minute here. 
[00:53:30]  He will not stop with the cursing.  It's going to be almost impossible.  We're going to have a great old town, right, Eric?  What's up?  We're going to have a good old town now.  Oh, yeah.  And talk about Christmas.  You guys are going to be getting some Christmas presents.  I miss my tippy.  Where's my tippy?  I know.  We all miss tippy, bro.  I do.  We all miss tippy.  We couldn't find him.  Tom tippy died.  Tom tippy died.  We couldn't...  I'm going to ask you something.  Are you tippy?  Am I queer?  Not that I know of.  If you're queer, Anthony. 
[00:54:00]  Not that I know of, but I'm willing to learn.  What are you going to know about it, Ant?  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Let's try to control it.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  We got blue.  Well, half the mics aren't effing working.  Thank God.  I want to ask you something.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah?  I want to ask you something.  There we go.  Yes.  Can I marry you?  Big Red wants to marry you, Anthony.  Big Red, your eyesight must be a little off.  Opie's the cute one. 
[00:54:30]  You got to think he has no teeth, though.  It'll be fun.  Oh, he's saying you talk like a girl, Anthony.  Well, you know, let me tell you.  Tippy Tom, from you, that is a compliment.  That's a compliment.  No, yes, it is.  That is Tippy Tom.  I've seen Tippy Tom, and I know that's Tippy Tom.  All homeless look alike.  I know it.  And, Tippy, you don't look as good today as you usually do.  You look like a wreck today.  You usually look a lot better, Tippy. 
[00:55:00]  Can we get some more volume up on their mics, please?  Well, boy, is he, uh, I'm pinned on the board.  We need more volume.  I hope we have an 800-second delay today.  You know, you can do an asshole.  Ding, that's gone.  All right, listen.  I'll ring the bell every time.  There, that was gone.  All right, listen, why don't we take the mic away from Big Red, because we're running out of dump.  All right, stop cursing, Big Red.  All right.  And look at stupid me trying to control this mess.  I know.  It's just a good luck. 
[00:55:30]  Keith's got the mic.  Keith, help me out here.  A bunch of pirates.  That's what they are.  Who do we have in the room?  Why don't you just do a quick, around the room, let him say something really fast on your one microphone that we know works well, and then we'll get him out of here.  Let's go.  All right.  And then on the bus.  This is O-Head.  O-Head's from the Port Authority bus terminal.  O-Head, what's up?  What's up, O-Head?  He's like one of the best Port Authority guys you can ever run into if you're traveling.  Yeah.  He'll get you where you need to go.  I also go to jail for doing it, but we'll all do our best, you know.  What can I tell you?  All right, you're going to have a good time.  What do you need?  O-H guy. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  O-Head, O-Head, what's the one thing you need this winter that you want to get when you go shopping today?  A house.  Plus how it's done in the fucking mouth.  Thank you, O-Head.  All right.  All right.  I bet you Al got that down the hall.  Hey, did you get that one, Al?  Okay, Pookie.  Dump out of the curse words.  All right.  There's a big-time curse there.  All right, Keith, who else do we got?  Next up is Big Pop.  Big Pop.  What's up?

[00:57:00]  so I don't know.  If you can work it, you got any game?  Yeah, what do you mean by a young body?  Are you going to give some pussy up?  Goddamn, Red.  All right, keep Big Red away from the microphone.  Wow.  He's cursing his ass off.  Red is a potty mouth, literally.  I want to know.  Smelt that breath.  I want to know what Big Pop means by a young body.  Big Pop.  Hey, Keith Robinson.  Big Pop.  Big Pop.  Keith Robinson.  What's up?  What do you mean by a young body?  No, you're a female.  Oh, you want a young female? 
[00:57:30]  Ah, okay.  Well, maybe one of our listeners.  Maybe one of our listeners that are there.  There's going to be a lot of people there to greet you guys.  Maybe you could find one in the crowd if you got some game, you know?  I got good game.  All right, bro.  I got good game.  You got some old shirts that you have?  The shirts?  Anything.  Oh, the shirts?  We're handing out shirts, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Keith, go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  This is James.  James is our last-minute entry after Annette took off.  What's up, James?  What's up, James?  Sometimes they call me slow motion. 
[00:58:00]  Sometimes, you know, they call me a different name, you know, but...  I hear you.  As long as they don't forget to call me for lunch, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, don't call me late for lunch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hear you.  And what are you looking for this Christmas?  What do you need?  Well, this Christmas, I'm looking to get out of town, you know, find me a nice hooker and...  All right.  And spread some joy.  Spread some joy.  Get some joy in the land, yeah.  This guy, finally, somebody with a true spirit of Christmas. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, straight, straight like that, yeah.  Yeah, I hear you.  I think he's...  I'm going to get out and reach out and touch somebody like AT&T, you know?  All right, I hear you.  I think he's going to stay in Jersey.  You're not coming back to New York, you know?  I hear you.  Okay.  Well, enjoy yourself and Merry Christmas and you're going to be going shopping with the  rest of the boys and having some fun.  Okay.  Where are we going now?  Short Hills Mall.  Okay, hey. 
[00:59:00]  What's that, the Toys R Us or what?  All right.  All right, that's enough from James.  Last minute substitution, James.  Yeah, next up, this is Dave.  This is the guy who came from...  All right, wait, wait, wait.  Big restaurants are going toward the mic again.  Who's this, Keith?  I'm feeling about this one, LP.  This is a WYSP contestant from Philly.  Are you saving up to be Jewish?  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you doing, bro?  I'm doing all right.  Yeah.  It kind of sucks I couldn't bring my dog with me, though. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah, no dogs on a bus.  We'll have food, man.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It'll be okay.  Wait, who's watching your dog?  A friend of mine.  Yeah?  What's his name again, Keith?  Everyone's talking.  Scraps?  Yeah, this is David.  David, all right.  I'm David.  My dog, Scraps.  Your dog, Scraps.  Oh, okay.  You got a little mohawk there, huh?  Yep.  You always wear the mohawk, or was that a...  Yeah, since I was 13.  Ever since you were 13, wear the mohawk.  All right.  Any reason?  Nah.  Nah.  Freak people out.  I just enjoy it. 
[01:00:00]  What are you going to get at the mall today?  I don't know yet.  Jacket, shoes, I'm not sure.  All right, cool.  All right, run on.  Okay, use some shoes.  Thanks for joining us all the way from Philly there, David.  All right.  Who else we got, Keith?  And here we go.  Papa Rock.  Papa Rock.  Where's Papa Rock?  The guitar.  Papa Rock, how you doing, man?  Rock and roll.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm only on my first beer.  How can I rock and roll?  Yeah?  Compliments.  Well, now, how's your guitar been holding up? 
[01:00:30]  This guitar is compliments of Opie and Anthony and the producers of the show.  And how's it holding up out there in the street?  Well, your signature's running off.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Look how beat up the guitar looks.  Your signature's running off, but Opie's is still bright and clear.  Where's your little amp?  You've got about 20 bags here.  Yeah, where's your amp today?  Oh, so you can't play us a tune?  No, not right now.  All right, what are you going to get at the ball there? 
[01:01:00]  Almost guitar, dude.  Maybe another little amp?  One that works?  Yeah.  One with lots of knobs he could fiddle with?  Yeah, just something to fiddle with.  Just fiddling with?  Extra knobs glued on to fiddle and turn with.  He likes to fiddle.  Who else we got?  All right, Scott?  Have a whole face?  Right, of course.  Have a whole face.  How y'all doing today?  Very good.  Have a whole face.  I think you're going to be a very big hit when you walk off that bus. 
[01:01:30]  We'll see.  I think the crowd's really going to enjoy you.  I personally would like a picture with you and Santa at the store, because they have  the Santa thing.  Oh, Rob, go on.  I haven't done that in years.  I want to send that out as my Christmas card this year.  I think it'll be fun.  No problem.  Santa says, what do you want for Christmas?  I'm going to just look at him and go, guess.  Guess.  Could you just figure it out, Santa?  I'll give you one guess.  One lousy guess.  Of course, we picked up Gray Wolf.  What's up, Gray Wolf?  How you doing?  What's happening?  Obi, Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  All right, Gray Wolf.  Very good, very good.  Your song, of course, huge hit.  I know.  And I hear now we have an extended version.  Yeah.  Can't wait to hear that.  What is it?  I also have a record that I was like last year I was performing with a group on 45th Street  playing the flute for the guys for A-ha.  That's the one that's the song that says, Take On Me.  Yeah.  Well, we're very familiar with that one.  And I think this was the best about West Clara, which I brought a copy.  And there's a picture of the guys with me over there.  And I talked to my boss. 
[01:02:30]  He says, give this to the people here.  All right.  This is a gift from Wawa's Cladas.  And that's it.  And I'm still homeless, guys.  Are you?  No matter what, I'm bouncing from one friend's house to another to stay a little cleaner.  I've been off the booze.  I go every now and then and get drunk.  But it's this simple thing.  The thing is that if this record will be able to, through America, if you buy it, I talked  to Keefe about, I want to put a $5 donation for some kind of coalition that will Keefe 
[01:03:00]  will be in charge of the money so we can get homeless people housed in.  And the rest, I want to have a nice house for myself and a golf course.  A golf course.  He wants a golf course.  He wants to give the homeless.  So he wants a big house and a golf course and he wants to give the homeless $5 is what  I got out of that.  All right.  Isn't that what we do?  Who haven't we talked to yet?  We got this one guy and I think he just wandered in with the rest of the group because I have  absolutely no clue who he is. 
[01:03:30]  What's your name there, gentlemen?  No, my name's Marcus.  No, I talked to Kenny, I think a couple weeks ago.  He's probably buying you guys sandwiches or something like that.  I thought he's blown me off.  Oh, but you're homeless.  So I'm really happy to be here today.  You're homeless?  Yeah, I am homeless.  I've been homeless for years, man.  Wow.  And it's really nice what you guys are doing today.  Well, we figured, you know, it's the spirit of giving.  It's the holiday season.  So you guys ought to...  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  You tell it. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Cool.  We got Marcus.  But it is.  We had...  We got...  Me and my friend, we got...  We took too much drugs last night and then we...  Yeah.  I was thinking about this thing.  It was in the future where you guys will be looked upon as like forebears of some sort  of...  There was a...  It was a vent and...  Yeah, we'll be...  There's probably CGI effects in the movie stuff that happened later.  I love this guy.  Wow.  The homeless matrix.  The homeless matrix.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  I'm going to work on that.  All right.  I heard there was free liquor as well.  I like it.  Thanks.  The guy that almost fought Mr. Poe.  All right.  No, he's not here.  Oh, yeah.  Where's G.I.?  We couldn't fight G.I.?  Yeah, he was a no-  G.I.'s M.I.A., huh?  Yeah.  And our final homeless person is to my right here.  He was hard to find, but this is...  What's your name, sir?  The whole two dollars.  My name is Fez from the Ron and Fez Show, and I'm really not supposed to be here.  I have a home. 
[01:05:00]  I kind of feel like the fat kid in Shawshank Redemption.  I'm not supposed to be here.  Oh, mama.  Fez, you just got to trust us on this one.  You are homeless, and we're trying to take care of you.  We're hearing different stories.  I heard the story about you at the Apple store, looking all disheveled, and people were taking  pictures with their camera phones and then sending them in, and apparently you're living  some kind of lie.  Like, you're homeless.  Yeah, I was mistaken for being homeless on the street a couple weekends ago, and now I'm 
[01:05:30]  part of this homeless nativity scene that you've put together here.  So I'm really confused on how all this has happened.  I don't know how Ronnie does so well.  Yeah.  You've got to renegotiate your contract if this is the case, because Ronnie does well.  He has a place to live and everything.  Nice clothes.  Yeah, nice clothes.  Cigars.  And you end up a homeless bum on the streets.  On the homeless shopping spree.  I heard there was a meal, really. 
[01:06:00]  That's why I'm here.  What are you looking forward to buying at the mall?  I'm supposed to get church pants.  Tight, itchy church pants.  Church pants and cigars, I hear.  Oh, yeah.  That's also on my list.  Cigars.  I can't come home without cigars.  Now, that's odd.  You don't smoke cigars.  Yes.  Yes.  If anyone asks, I do.  I'm supposed to say I smoke cigars.  I'm blinking a code to you.  Get me out of this.  No, you belong here. 
[01:06:30]  This looks like the casting call for the part of Grady on Sanford.  It's like, what am I doing here?  You're in some kind of denial is what it is.  And we're just trying to get you to that next step.  You know, because you're in denial.  You've got to face your life and the way it is.  You're homeless.  So what's next?  I stay here with you guys and everyone else leaves on the bus?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's blue.  He's taking over a mic over there.  Well, that's not blue. 
[01:07:00]  It's just really dark black.  Wow.  Well, Fez, welcome to the Homeless Shopping Spring 2006.  My only advice I could give you is get a window seat and open it immediately.  Opie.  Yeah.  Opie, my brother, my sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, greatest radio station I ever heard.  All right.  Thank you.  See, that's it.  That's a promo right there.  All right.  Let's go to Big Kev.  He's at the mall.  Big Kev, what's going on?  He has an observation here.  Big Kev, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Your savages are on both sides of the street at the entryway where the bus will be arriving. 
[01:07:30]  And they're screaming at the cars that come by.  If there's any little kids in the car, they're screaming.  There's no Santa Claus.  Oh, my God.  You know, our listeners are creeps.  They just ruin everything.  They do.  Well, this will be the final homeless shopping spree.  And they're screaming, whip them out to every woman that passes by. 
[01:08:00]  And there's some people who are, it's right by a parking deck.  Yeah.  So people who are going to their cars are getting absolutely whip them out and everything.  It's amazing.  But there's no Santa Claus.  They're screaming it relentlessly at cars that can't move with children in them.  All we ask, we better get the bus there quickly.  All we ask, if you go in the Short Hills Mall for the homeless shopping spree, just try to behave.  Behave, please.  We want to do this bit again.  All right.  I think we're ready to go, huh?  Anything else, Keith? 
[01:08:30]  No, that's it.  No, well, that's it.  We're all good.  All right.  Oh, yes, sir?  I'm going to ask you something.  If you was in the woods and you had a gun.  Right.  And there was a man eating lion 50 yards away.  But you looked up and there was a snake coming down the tree.  Uh-huh.  You had the gun.  Which one would you shoot?  You.  Blue said you.  I assume the snake. 
[01:09:00]  Huh?  The snake.  You would shoot the snake?  Yeah, why?  No, I'd shoot the lion.  You would shoot the lion?  You know which one I would shoot?  Which one?  The gun.  Ah!  There you go.  Now I know what I want instead of church pants.  Yeah, what?  A book of homeless brain teasers.  Yeah, that was a tough one.  All right.  Let's get the homeless out of here.  Oh!  I can't be.  I got a cold.  Oh, shake his hand.  Dude, I got a cold.  Shake his hand.  Shake Blue's hand.  I got a cold.  Shake his hand.  Anthony, shake Blue's hand. 
[01:09:30]  Shake his hand.  Shake his hand.  What's wrong with you?  Shake his hand.  Shut up, you jackasses.  Hey, Blue, come here.  Shake his hand.  Yeah, Blue, Blue.  We did.  I got a cold.  I got a cold.  Shake Anthony's hand.  You don't want to be sick out on the streets.  Blue, it's okay.  It's all right now, Blue.  No, no.  You guys, they got to get to the bus.  All right.  The listeners are waiting.  You jackasses selling me out like that.  I could have hepatitis.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  Have fun, bro.  He's going.  Fuck you. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, he's all around.  Oh, he is pissed.  Hey, they just dumped out.  But yeah, Jimmy's yelling, hey, Tippy Tom, the big red.  And he turns around and just goes, F you.  He just curses.  Oh, is he?  He does not like to be called Tippy.  He's salty.  I just hope that our listeners don't refer to him as Tippy Tom when they get to the other  mall.  No, that would not be good.  Don't call him Tippy Tom.  It'll just upset him.  Don't do that.  And he'll misbehave.  You don't want him cursing at nice mall people.  You didn't open this while I wasn't looking and rub something on it like you did to a peanut 
[01:10:30]  butter jar the other day, didn't you?  No.  I think Blue just licked the top.  No, he didn't.  It'll be all right.  Hey, let's say hi to Stan.  He's in Jersey.  I'm sure he's at the mall, Short Hills Mall.  What's up, Stan?  What up?  Yo, get them guys, them dirty bansies on the bus because that street is insane.  It's insane.  All right.  Well, they're heading out right now.  We'll see where they are after the break, I guess.  Is it possible for them?  Thanks, Stan. 
[01:11:00]  Huh?  No, no.  I thought something was unimportant.  I'll just ask Kenny out there.  All right.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's up?  Boys, you better get here soon.  The natives are getting restless.  We're being well-behaved.  We're ruining children's Christmas.  Jason, and we're hiling cabs, if you will, as they pass by.  Our listeners are asses.  Thank you.  There's a good 500 people down here.  Debbie, happy type and go.  Recording it all from South Dog.  ONA!  ONA!  ONA!  ONA!  Wow. 
[01:11:30]  Sounds like Nuremberg.  1944.  Oh, wow.  All right.  And it looks like it.  It certainly does.  All right.  Here's the deal.  As we go to break, we got people calling in like crazy.  They're sitting in traffic trying to get to the mall, the Short Hills Mall.  The homeless are getting on the bus as we speak here.  They're on their way.  It's like that scene out of The Honey Motors.  I never knew Nazis were so fat.  We'll be listening in as the homeless are on the bus.  They'll be singing Christmas carols and all that.  Of course they will. 
[01:12:00]  I hear Lady Di is at the mall.  We'll talk to her.  She should be on the bus.  What a great day.  It's the homeless shopping spree 2006.  Spirit of giving.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Christmas.  A time for family.  Presents.  Holiday cheer.  And a strung out bum puking into a mall planter.  It's the Opie and Anthony homeless shopping spree.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:12:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the homeless shopping spree 2006.  The bums are on the bus.  The bums are on the bus.  By the way, a quick plug.

Yep.  Beating out porno.  Only we can beat out porno!  Of course.  It's such an important thing we're doing today.  All right.  We got Than.  He's on the bus.  Than, what's going on?  Poor bastard.  Hi.  We've gone two blocks. 
[01:15:00]  That's about it, huh?  Yeah.  You hitting traffic?  Actually, it looks good going so far, going across town.  All right.  Should we give out the route?  Yeah.  So, that if people want to maybe tag along and, you know, join the convoy?  Yeah, definitely.  They could do that.  Which way are you guys taking?  Let me double check with Kenny.  Kenny, do we have a route picked out yet?  So, people might be able to honk as we go by?  Yeah, we're going 11th, 57th to 11th to the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, they're taking the Lincoln Tunnel.  Okay.  And then when you get out of the tunnel, what, the Turnpike?  And then when we get out of the tunnel, we're taking 24 west to the mall.  24 west to the mall.  All right.  Good luck on that road today.  You know, I told you, it's going to be a lot of traffic.  14 and then 24 west.  All right.  So, we go to exit 14 and then 24 west.  All right.  All right.  What happened after we said goodbye to you guys here in the studio?  Was it an easy load up? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, more or less.  Some of the guys wanted to sit a little farther front than we cared for them to.  Well, are you guys leaving through the Lincoln or Holland Tunnel?  Lincoln.  All right.  Smart move.  Yeah.  Take the 11th Avenue exit, by the way.  Ignore, I would say, ignore 9th Avenue.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  Yeah, that's what they're doing.  Are they going to 11th Avenue?  Yeah, yeah.  They just gave all their directions.  That's exactly what they're doing.  How am I not listening, Jimmy?  I don't know.  That's exactly what they just said.  They're taking 11th Avenue down to the Lincoln Tunnel.  Talk about, wow, what a bad example.  I'm like, I'm looking at you like, did you just have an aneurysm in front of us? 
[01:16:30]  I want to hear that on the replay.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, what?  Sometimes you listen back on the replay and cringe at what you said.  Are you a senator?  All right.  Than.  Yeah, do you guys want to, we've distributed the lyric sheets.  Do you want a sing-along yet?  Yeah, we should start with a little sing-along.  That would be nice.  All right.  We'll see how this goes.  It's usually pretty smooth.  Just a second.  We're making an announcement. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, guys.  You guys want to do a little sing-along?  Yeah, what the hell.  They sound very festive.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the enthusiasm is palpable.  Wait, who's cursing?  One of our security gentlemen is very passionate about getting these guys riled up.  All right, listen.  Tell the security guys to not curse.  It's hard enough to make sure the homeless don't curse.  We're trying to get as much of this on the radio as possible today. 
[01:17:30]  We have no lyric sheets for our gentleman friend here.  All right, we'll start with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  You guys ready?  Rudolph.  One, two, three.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Have a good night.  Have a good night.  Come on, Luke.  Come on, Luke.  Jesus.  These guys barely have energy, and they're yelling at him to sing louder. 
[01:18:00]  They're yelling at him like it's a chain gang.  Oh, wow.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  Wow, that was great.  All right, I am really getting in the Christmas spirit.  Yeah, anything else to report, then?  No, right now we're just warming up, I think.  All right, you're settling in for the ride to the wall.  Very good.  Thank you, Sam.  And is there a camera on board?  I mean, do we have a video camera?  Yeah, we're rolling the whole time.  Oh, very good, very good.  Is Sam on the bus with his camera?  Sam is here with his camera.  I got my camera.  All right, we'll have a lot of videos up on opandanthony.com and all the other websites. 
[01:19:00]  Cool.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome, buddy.  All right.  Let's say hi to John.  He's at the mall.  We're going to the Short Hills Mall with the homeless people here.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, my God, this is amazing.  The other thing is, the new chant is every time someone pulls up with a minivan, they're  screaming, soccer mom.  Yeah.  Yeah, the listeners are very bored, so they're starting their chants over there.  The soccer mom chant, not quite that funny. 
[01:19:30]  This is how richy this place is.  There's 180, you know how you go to a mall and they have the cars on display?  Yeah.  There's a $181,000 Bentley in the middle of the floor.  Wow.  Are people allowed to sit in it?  I don't know.  I hope so.  That'd be nice, yeah.  I'll shut up.  Got some of our homeless in there.  Yeah, just have them.  Four bums and a Bentley.  Yeah, just have them run their hand up and down the side of the Bentley.  Kiss the windshield. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  John.  Nothing illegal about kissing a windshield.  No, sir.  Oh.  John, how many people are at the mall, do you think?  Oh, right in front of me?  I had to walk away, but there's literally like 400 in front of me and there's no like 200  inside.  Just a lot of people.  There's a lot of people.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kevin in New York.  Kevin, what's up?  I know.  Good call.  Kevin.  Yo.  What's going on?  You're live on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, man?  Yeah, we're sitting in traffic over here.  It's pain in the ass to get down here. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  People were, I think people went out last night.  Yeah.  I'm getting my first view, by the way, on Pal Talk of the crowd.  Unbelievable.  They're somebody holding up an Opie and Dopey fired newspaper.  That was good.  Oh, great.  And, yeah, it's just Happy Typing Girl is going along the line.  I guess they're keeping them in kind of a line that's about 15 people deep or 20 people 
[01:21:00]  deep and then goes the length of the mall in the parking garage.  They're in different areas.  So there goes a police car.  I see the police car going by.  They're on both levels of the parking garage that I can see.  And it just keeps going and going and going.  She's turning the camera.  Every way she goes, there are people, crowds of people.  There's an officer keeping some order.  Oh, my God.  By the time these homeless people get there, I don't think they know what they're in store for.  They are rock stars. 
[01:21:30]  When they get off of this bus, they're going to be greeted by thousands of people cheering and screaming for them.  And I think now that, unfortunately, we weren't able to get Andrew on the bus.  That was my – I think half a Hulk face, I predict, to be the favorite, the star.  He should be the last one off the bus.  There is – they're setting up police barricades.  This is unbelievable.  Yeah, this is huge.  Stupid Andrew.  I know.  Bum.  It's like the one day you have no place to live. 
[01:22:00]  You can't be somewhere on a Saturday.  One place he ought to be in his whole life.  I forgot.  Oh, I had an appointment.  And we all knew it, too.  Every day we're like, you know where you're supposed to be Saturday.  Yes, right here.  I'll be here.  Right here.  He doesn't know where here is.  And then finally the day comes, and he's nowhere to be seen.  He was going to go get glasses.  He needed glasses.  He was going to get glasses.  He would have gotten glasses, too.  Dope, but with the dumbest frames ever.  That's what I wanted to do.  Take him to, like, Vision Center or something. 
[01:22:30]  Have him set up with some prescription glasses with ridiculous woman frames.  Yeah.  He needed frames, and he was going to get them.  Yeah.  Well, I would love to hear from the bus again.  I mean, we need constant contact from the bus, I mean, because that's where the action is right now.  They are lining the entrance to this mall.  I'm seeing two levels just packed with people.  I've got to tell you, we've done the homeless shopping spree.  This is the fourth annual, and this is going to be the biggest crowd by far.  I mean, by far.  One year we had a couple thousand easily. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  I think this is way over that, way over that this year.  Once the people are there, yeah.  Once we get the homeless in and they're shopping.  Yeah, these are just the people that showed up early.  Well, because what happens, too, there's people in their cars in the parking lot and doing a little, you know, pregame.  They're just hanging out.  Tailgating.  Yeah, as soon as they know that the bus is close, then all of a sudden all those people will join the crowd.  I see Lady Di.  I see No Filter Paul.  Pal Talk rocks.  Yeah, when the bus pulls in, it is an event.  I mean, the cheering starts, the fans line the side of the road, and the bus pulls in like it is a rock band tour bus coming in. 
[01:23:30]  And then when they get off of that bus, the cheers that they get.  Hey, someone on Pal Talk can go F themselves.  I hate when Opie exaggerates.  What am I exaggerating about?  What am I exaggerating about?  Hey, you know what's not going to be exaggerated?  When reports come in that it's well over 2,000, you're going to look like the ass.  I guarantee there's going to be well over 2,000. 
[01:24:00]  Douchebag.  Douchebag.  Da-de-da-de-de.  Don't worry, Opie.  You will not hear from him again.  Other radio shows exaggerate.  We try to keep it pretty honest here.  And the best homeless shopping spree we did, there was at least 2,000 people there, and this one's going to be way over that.  Guaranteed.  I guarantee it.  Yeah, we're doing it on a Saturday afternoon in a big mall in Jersey.  Enough with the haters.  If you don't effing like the show, then get out of the effing Pal Talk room and don't listen to the show. 
[01:24:30]  Leave.  Who do we got on the bus?  It's me again.  Hey, what's up, then?  Oh, yeah.  He said this is where the action is, but we're basically commuting at this point, so.  Well, just get, I mean, you're our eyes, so tell us what's going on on the bus.  I mean, are some of them sleeping?  What are they doing?  Sleeping.  Are they farting?  Are they eating?  Are they behaving?  Are they reading?  Papa Rock is a...  Are they reading?  Are they checking their email on their BlackBerrys? 
[01:25:00]  What's going on?  Papa Rock is in a state of semi-consciousness.  All right.  Everybody else is pretty behaved, just kind of looking alert.  I don't know.  You get to bring in their A-games today.  All right.  I'm going to go right to Rich Voss.  Thanks, Dan.  Voss, also on the bus.  What's up, Voss?  Well, let me tell you, it's not the best smell on the planet.  As one was walking into the bus, it was falling backwards, and I caught him because I was sitting up front. 
[01:25:30]  When do we tell them that they have to give everything back?  That would be great if they were all arrested for stealing on the way out.  You got to say, they are actually pretty normal.  I don't think that half of them have been on a bus in, you know, 20 years.  I think we should just pull into a police station or something.  Ha-ha.  Merry Christmas.  Happy holidays, bum.  I dare you to yell out, you guys thought you were going to the mall, but you're all going to be arrested.  All right.  Hey, you know what?  The joke is we're not going to the mall. 
[01:26:00]  We're going to the police station.  All right?  So if any of you guys have warrants, you better get out now.  We're not falling around.  We're serious.  Oh, no.  We're going to the police station, so if you have warrants, now's your time to get out.  They're going to jump the driver, you idiot.  I don't care.  That didn't sound official at all.  We're going to the police station.  I know.  Yeah.  Why don't you just, we're going to see a policeman.  Right.  Would have sounded better.  We're going to the pokey. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, Voss, you should do some stand-up on the bus.  You should entertain the homeless.  Oh, you want me to do a few minutes?  Yeah, just do like a minute.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, have Kenny introduce you.  Hey, Kenny.  All right.  Kenny, you got to introduce me.  I'm going to do a few.  Yeah, we got some entertainment for the homeless.  It's Rich Voss, everybody.  Kenny's getting off the bus for a second.  He just got off the bus.  He's stopping traffic.  Why is he getting off the bus?  To stop traffic so we can get through the tunnel because it's, like, backed up.  Oh, wow.  Very cool.  All right.  Oh, so we're just about at the tunnel? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, but it's, like, bumper to bumper.  You got to see the outside of this bus.  You know when you watch Charlie Brown Peanuts?  You know, take Penn, that, like, the mist around him?  Yeah.  That's what the outside of this bus looks like right now.  Hey, Rich, what street are you on now?  You're on 11th and what?  Right now on 11th, turning as we're, you know, as you're going into the tunnel area.  They're doing good.  Oh, you're making a left already to go into the tunnel?  Yeah, we're on the curb.  Kenny's stopping traffic.  Kenny and I don't know if the other guy, Jack, when I was leaving the studio, I got in the elevator. 
[01:27:30]  I wanted to get in by myself and go down, so the door's closing, and Jack puts his hand in it,  and every homeless guy gets into one elevator with me.  Jack, whoever you are.  Good.  A bunch of homeless people and one who will be soon.  I know.  The only good thing about this is there's 10 people on this bus that I know I'm doing better than.  One thing I know.  All right, Voss, hold on line for one second, and, you know, set it up for Kenny to introduce you to do some entertainment on the bus. 
[01:28:00]  I want to go to Fez, who's also on the bus for the homeless shopping spree.  Fez, what's going on?  Hello, NYPD?  No, no, Fez.  No, Opie and Anthony.  I'm trapped on a bus with homeless people.  We're about to enter the Lincoln Tunnel headed towards Jersey.  Ah, Fez.  Fez.  They say if the bus goes any slower than 15 miles an hour, the homeless will lose bladder control.  It's moving speed. 
[01:28:30]  No, no, Fez, you didn't call the NYPD.  It's us, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, hi, guys.  Everything's going great.  Yeah, you enjoying yourself?  Yeah, so far.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.  We're about to go in the Lincoln Tunnel.  I'm looking forward to it, just what this bus needs to get a little darker.  Yeah.  I like it.  Fez fits our show well.  Oh, yeah.  He jumps right in.  Any observations there, Fez?  Well, I know.  You know, it's the opposite of Rosa Parks.  All the homeless wanted to get immediately to the back of the bus, so I don't know what's going on back there exactly. 
[01:29:00]  Are you like the poor kid that always got beat up?  You'd have to sit right behind the driver?  Exactly.  I'm trying to get as far to the front as I can.  Now, Fez, you're a little scared when it comes to tunnels and bridges.  Yeah, and we're heading into the tunnel.  I may lose you here.  Oh, really?  They have cell service in the tunnels now these days, Fez.  Yeah, they're in the tunnel right now.  Ever since, you know, that 9-11 thing. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, but did you ever think what happens if something happens in the tunnel?  Wouldn't it be ironic that all the time you've worried about it, this would be the one time that maybe if something happened, you would be trapped with homeless people?  Yeah, these are the people I want to say my final goodbyes to.  The people that have meant the most to me during my life.  Yeah.  Well, you enjoy yourself, but you have Ronnie to really thank for this.  He kind of said this would do you good. 
[01:30:00]  You need to get out there and toughen up a little.  He brought it to our attention that, you know, you're homeless there, Fez.  I can't reiterate enough.  I am not homeless.  I have an address.  I have a mailing address.  Address?  We know about that.  We're talking about a home.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll get a new address today.  All right, Fez.  We got to go back to Voss.  He's going to do some entertainment for everybody.  Call us on the other side of the tunnel, okay?  Okay.  But for people keeping track at home, the bus is, it looks like it's in the tunnel, the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  So they're probably maybe, I don't know, depending on traffic, anywhere is from a half hour to 45 minutes away from the mall.  That's nice that Kenny can, you know, use some liberties.  Excuse me, I have a bus that needs to be somewhere.  Let me tell you, Kenny and Jack were great.  They just stopped traffic like there was a terrorist attack.  You know, that is bad, and everybody was, I'm telling you, the guys, did we just get cut off in the tunnel?  No, no, we can hear you.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:31:00]  Voss.  Yeah, you want to do a little stand-up?  Yeah, have Kenny introduce you to the homeless.  All right, let's go back.  I'm going to cut off my phone.  Haven't they suffered enough, the homeless?  I know.  Hold on.  Hey, Kenny, they want to do a little stand-up.  I'm kidding.  We're going to have them sit down.  All right.  Let's do that.  Bye.  Oh, no.  We just lost them.  All right, we'll get them on the other side.  Let's see.  People are asking why we didn't go as well, because we have to control it from a safe location. 
[01:31:30]  I have made a vow.  I do nothing outside the studio.  Yeah.  After a night in jail, no matter what.  I actually would have gone on this one.  You earned your keep.  You paid your dues.  No, this is what I would have went on.  I just knew this was going to be a big one and fun, and we got cops with us, so there's  not going to be any problems.  It's a bunch of dopey idiot shopping, and I couldn't.  I really wanted to go to this one, too.  And the listeners that are going to be there would have been really ... The energy there  would have been so cool to step off a bus and see all those people.  But yeah, every mission needs a mission control.  We've never been on a homeless shopping spree. 
[01:32:00]  We always do it from the studio.  It's just a lot easier to do the broadcast this way.  It's hard on the phone.  It's hard to control.  We did a bus thing one time.  We were going around doing ... What was that thing we did?  We were just riding around on a bus.  It was a nightmare.  Just handing out our brand new WOW stickers that we were trying to broadcast live on a  bus.  It was a complete nightmare.  A couple of people commenting off topic here on Pal Talk about Jimmy's kiss jacket.  The zipper zips right where the K and the I, I guess, separates the SS.  So it just looks like a Nazi SS logo on the lightning bolts. 
[01:32:30]  No, we haven't redecorated the studio.  All right, let's go back to Than because Voss is about to do his set.  Than, what's going on?  Voss is standing by, as is Kenny.  Would you like Kenny to give his intro?  Yes.  All right.  Kenny, here you go.  Okay.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  And welcome to the homeless shopping spree.  Woo-hoo!  Tonight, the greatest, the greatest show, radio show people ever, I hope you and Anthony finally 
[01:33:00]  present the comedy stylings of Mr. Rich Voss.  Hey, how we doing, folks?  All right, calm down.  You don't get anything.  The good thing is, I'm doing a show for a homeless.  I used to go out with a homeless girl, which was great, because after sex, I could drop 
[01:33:30]  her off anywhere.  You know what I'm saying?  You guys saw me on TV.  Have you walked past the store when I was on?  We had the guy, the real guy, the real Indian here.  And I remember in school, when the teachers used to say, sit Indian style, I'd get a bottle  of whiskey and lay on the curb.  Now, we got the Indian guy that has major resentment with the white guy with the mohawk  over here. 
[01:34:00]  Are you upset that this guy has a mohawk?  The one behind me?  Yeah.  I mean, you're a real Indian.  He has a reservation.  He has a reservation?  Yeah.  Really?  Red, Red, how you doing?  Yeah.  You're good.  No way.  Nice talking.  I've never talked about hepatitis before.  Yes, I did.  Oh, no.  This is a good crowd.  Where's Blue from The Temptations?  Oh, my God.  Blue used to sing with a temp, didn't you, baby?  Huh?  All right, here's the deal. 
[01:34:30]  Before we go to the mall, we're going to stop off at the dentist, okay?  You guys should have your teeth.  Everybody can get your teeth cleaned, so that'll take five minutes.  And now we're going to go to the mall, all right?  All right.  It's going to be...  Hey, you've got to wake this guy up, man.  Look at this.  Hey, hey.  Is the heroin that good?  He makes the guy that look like...  Who looked into the art look healthy, you know what I'm saying?  I just spit on a couple of them, but they don't know it. 
[01:35:00]  It doesn't matter.  Age beating age.  Just cancel itself out.  You can come see me if you like.  He's plugging.  I'll be at Caroline's New Year's Eve.  Caroline, if you guys could get in, in New York, yes.  Not the one in Parsippany, jackass.  In New York.  This guy loves me.  He's my favorite.  What's your name again?  Blue.  Blue.  You're blue?  Yeah, I'm blue.  Oh, I thought you were ashy.  Anyhow.  Look how dry you are.  I'm getting thirsty just talking to you. 
[01:35:30]  I know the struggle, brother.  All right, guys.  Peace out.  Enjoy the day.  If we're in the mall, and there's hot girls coming up to me, pretend you don't know me.  You know what I'm saying?  Peace out.  All right, Rich Voss, everyone.  Yeah.  Voss just performed on a bus with homeless people and did well.  He killed.  It's funny, man.  He absolutely killed.  Voss, good job.  Hey, you want to talk to Voss?  Yeah, yeah, real fast.  Hello?  Hey, Voss, great job. 
[01:36:00]  Thank you.  That was a good crowd.  I think I hit bonus.  Yeah, yeah, you felt good about that set.  What's that?  You felt good about that set.  I kind of liked it.  Do some good crowd work.  The one guy, Blue, was really into it.  Yeah.  Right?  Although he was looking at me like he probably saw like a Satan head or something on my neck.  But they were a good crowd.  Red was falling asleep and one guy's heroin is kicking in.  He's completely out.  Hey, Voss, if you do another set, do Michael Richards' set. 
[01:36:30]  No, I don't want to get to Apollo, man.  Anyhow, I'm going to give you back.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Rich, great job.  All right.  Hello?  Hey, Dan.  So where are we now?  We're out of the tunnel, getting near the turnpike.  It's about to get out of the turnpike.  Hey, we're doing all right.  The bus is on its way to the Short Hills Mall.  Cool.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a few minutes.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Let's see. 
[01:37:00]  Let's go to Ray in Cleveland.  Ray, what's up?  What's up, Owen?  Hey, this is probably one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life, man.  I really also respect the fact you guys are doing this for the homeless people.  And also, Voss, he got more of an impression than he did in freaking Cleveland.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, Voss killed on the bus, so there you go.  All right.  Thank you, Ray.  No problem.  Big hug to everybody in Cleveland.  Let's, oh, this is pretty interesting, too.  Paul in Jersey.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Dude, I'm from Jersey.  I just did a walk through the mall, like, surveying it. 
[01:37:30]  This is so pompous, this mall.  They don't know what they're going to get.  I came out the front, and I saw all those people, but everybody's in their cars.  And it's causing mass confusion because people are trying to park, and they see all these heads  in everybody's car.  So there's people just lined up thinking you're leaving, but you're not.  You're just sitting in your car.  So there's confusion within the parking lot on that aspect, too.  Oh, people listen to the radios.  Yeah, I got to get out.  You got to think there's a few hundred people just in cars listening to the show until we  get close.  Yeah, because they want to hear the show until the homeless get there.  Yeah.  And then people walk to their cars, and of course, in a crowded mall parking lot, you 
[01:38:00]  think that means they're leaving, and you can then get the parking space?  Yeah.  Oh, so now people are getting all mad.  Why is that guy with a mullet opening a Pabst Blue Ribbon in his car and laughing?  Pabst.  How long are you going on Free FM?  You're going to go over on Free FM?  Until it's over.  I don't know.  And for the people listening right now, you're not going to miss anything because they're  going to rebroadcast this whole show on Monday morning.  Yep.  Because I'm going to go get an FM radio now.  All right.  My XM doesn't work in there, so.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  All right. 
[01:38:30]  No problem.  That's odd.  All right.  In the mall, he is.  All right.  Traffic.  Oh, in the mall.  Traffic insane.  Brother-in-law working security at Short Hills today.  It's his first day.  Oh.  I love what you're doing for the homeless.  It just goes on and on.  Okay.  Why don't we step aside?  You know, we can play this when we get back.  Gray Wolf attempted to do another version of Shelter Me.  Was this the one we had already heard?  Like, he did a longer one that we heard at the mall last year?  Supposedly, he, someone got to him this week, and he just tried it again. 
[01:39:00]  Here's the original as we go to break.  One of our homeless friends, he's on the bus.  His name's Gray Wolf.  He came up with this little ditty on the spot for Tippy Tom.  It's a song called Shelter Me.  He just made it up on the spot.  And then Drew Boogie took what Gray Wolf did and put it to music, and it's just horrific.  Yes.  And we'll continue with the homeless shopping spree 2006 on the Opie and Anthony show right after this song.  And I'll quick break.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I threw up. 
[01:39:30]  I threw up.  I threw up.  Ah, this is nice.  Oh, yeah.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All we go.  All we go.  All we go.  It's late at night. 
[01:40:00]  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and all to go.  All my friends.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, that ain't you. 
[01:40:30]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life. 
[01:41:00]  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece.  You're listening to the 2006 Homeless Shopping Spring.  And now it's time for another Getting to Know the Homeless with your host, Steve C.  When's the last time you had a bath?  The last time I was so...  I got to be honest.  The smell in here is almost unbearable. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And it's coming off of you.  Stay tuned for another installment of Getting to Know the Homeless  here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Go get lost.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:42:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's Gary Hoey, by the way.  Gary Hoey.  Ho, ho, hoey.  Ho, ho, hoey.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Today it's the Homeless Shopping Spree 2006.  So far, so good, Anthony.  The bus is on its way to the Short Hills Mall or the mall at Short Hills. 
[01:42:30]  We're going to say hi to Danny on the bus in a second.  But first, let's go to Melanie.  Melanie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  You're at the mall?  I'm at the mall right now.  I'm from the town over, and I know the Short Hills Mall really well.  And I just want to say that it's crazy here.  They blocked off, like, two of the main entrances.  Yeah.  So it's kind of hard getting in.  But where everyone's at, I mean, people are hanging off the parking decks.  Like, it's just packed.  Oh, man. 
[01:43:00]  It's awesome.  I can't wait to see the video and the pictures because I can't imagine.  We're getting glimpses every once in a while from the PowTalk cameras.  They're on site, but their batteries are running out, or they're trying to save power.  Yeah, they're saving power.  It's kind of like a NASA mission.  Every once in a while, you get a little glimpse, and then, you know, they've got to shut down power to save batteries.  Until the big moment, you know.  Until the big moments.  Right, right.  No, it's crazy here.  I mean, everyone is just so excited for the homeless people to come and enjoy themselves. 
[01:43:30]  Right on.  Thank you, Melanie, for the update.  No problem, guys.  Have a good holiday.  All right.  Let's go to the bus, see where they're at.  We got Steve.  Steve, I'm sure, is just thrilled to be on the bus with the homeless.  Thanks to clean listeners.  Yeah.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, boys.  How are you?  What's going on on the bus there, Steve?  Well, the stench is really starting to move from the back of the bus to the front of the bus.  I couldn't be happier about that.  I'm actually trying to break wind to offset it, but it's not working. 
[01:44:00]  We're moving nicely.  It looks like we have a state official.  Or no, we don't.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  You guys are on your own, aren't you?  Yeah, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Yeah.  But it looks like we're going to be hearing another Christmas carol, Danny.  Yeah.  This one is called Pendulum.  It's from the band Foundry.  I handed out some of the Foundry CDs I had left over. 
[01:44:30]  Did you?  I had about 900 of them left over.  The homeless don't want them.  Hey, Steve.  900.  No, that's the voice call.  Hey, Steve.  Any problems on the bus?  Okay.  What's that?  Any problems on the bus?  Hold on.  I can't hear you.  There's a bum making noise.  Any problems on the bus?  No, not at all, actually.  No?  I think Blue got a little bit upset before when you played the Gray Wolf song.  Yeah?  Yeah, he got a little bit jealous.  He heard the tribute to Tippi Tom, and he got a little bit jealous and started making some noise. 
[01:45:00]  But that was very temporary.  But everybody's actually been pretty subdued so far.  Okay.  Boy, he can't stand Tippi Tom.  No, we can't.  Red doesn't like Tippi Tom.  No.  Oh, Blue hates Tippi Tom?  Blue doesn't like him?  Why was Blue getting upset?  I don't know.  He just heard the song, and he got all upset.  He was all ornery.  Why didn't there know song about me?  Why don't we go talk to Blue real fast?  I hate to do this to you, Steve, but I know.  It stinks.  I hate this.  He really does. 
[01:45:30]  Jesus.  Now this one's in my way.  Hey, Blue.  They want to talk to you.  Oh.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's what we need to do.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah.  What, what, what?  Hey, Blue.  Blue.  Okay, what?  Blue, why did you get so upset when, when, is he just going to yap over me?  Probably.  It's so hard to talk to the homeless.  Blue.  Well, why do you want to talk to the homeless?  Why do you want to talk to the Blue?  Wait.  We're talking to you, Blue.  Blue, why were you upset when you heard the Gray Wolf song? 
[01:46:00]  Hello.  See, it's, this is why they're homeless.  He's talking to the earpiece and he has the mouthpiece by his ear.  What is this thing?  All right, let's try again.  Anthony, why don't you try?  Blue.  Blue.  Blue.  Why were you getting upset and ornery when the Gray Wolf song?  Anthony, you can show.  Oh, yeah, I love y'all guys.  There's no.  So, you might as well just throw a cell phone into a monkey cage and expect to get some kind 
[01:46:30]  of an answer from him.  Oh, my phone has bum cheese on it.  Ah, bum cheese.  That's good.  Ah, wow.  I gotta disinfect my phone now.  Wow, that does not sound like a happy situation to be in.  No.  I am, I'm glad I'm not on that bus.  If we had gone, of course, we would have pulled up first in a nice limousine or something as  a prelude, but these poor bastards that have to ride on this.  Danny's on the bus, too? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, let's say hi to Danny.  Ah, Danny.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's going on?  Just for you guys, another reason that Blue couldn't hear you is because he had the earpiece  of Steve's phone pressed up against his cheek.  Dopes.  There's another reason why he couldn't hear you guys.  They are just dopey bums.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  How is it?  What's the atmosphere like in the bus?  And by atmosphere, I don't mean like the feel.  I mean the real atmosphere, air-wise.  What is it like?  It's very thick.  There's no other way I could describe it besides thick. 
[01:47:30]  Isn't that true?  When the homeless come in here, like before, when the whole crowd was in here, it's a thickness  that the air takes on.  It's a heaviness.  It's pungent.  Pungent.  Is the word.  Pungent.  Because their odor is so deep.  It's such a deep, it's a dull odor.  Dank.  Dank.  Dank.  It's a rotting odor.  They're odoriferous, fungal masses.  Many parts of their bodies rotting away.  Yeah, rot.  Just rotting.  There's a rot, moldy, dank, dark, deep heaviness. 
[01:48:00]  They smell like the opposite of money.  Danny.  Any other observations from the bus?  It's been a pretty tame ride so far.  They're being very, very behaved.  It's funny because Gray Wolf, the entire time, I don't think has once gotten off of his cell phone.  Oh, really?  It's nice to see a homeless guy with a cell phone, by the way.  And, you know, during one of the breaks, Blue was singing Silent Night, so I thought it would  be a good idea if he sang it on the air.  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's get Blue to sing Silent Night by himself. 
[01:48:30]  In honor of Ziggy, who passed with a homeless friend that used to go on the homeless shopping  spree.  He's got the words in front of him.  All right, you ready?  You're going to sing Silent Night, all right?  Go for it.  Silent Night.  Holy Night.  Always bright.  All my life.  You got the words in front of him. 
[01:49:00]  Come on.  Yeah, I think that's about all we're going to get.  Blue is a dope.  He stinks.  By the way, I brought the Polaroid camera in case anybody wants a picture with half a Hulk  size letter.  Oh, nice.  For five bucks.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing photo ops with half Hulk face as well for the people that show up at the mall.  Danny, how much are the photos going to be?  Photos, I think they're going to go for $5. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, Danny, I want to talk to some more of the homeless people.  Who do you think will be good right now?  Well, I would give you to Tippi Tom.  But he keeps cursing way too much.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a loose cannon.  Hey, Danny, just say, hey, Tippi, do you want to talk to the guys?  Yeah.  Hey, Tippi Tom, you want to talk to the guys?  Yeah, something like this.  Uh, Danny goes to Big Red. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, Tippi Tom, you want to talk to the guys?  And he goes, suck, bye.  Yeah, he was very upset.  Oh, does he, he gets so pissed.  He gets, man, can you imagine there's going to be about a thousand guys cheering Tippi Tom  when Big Red gets off the bus?  They're all going to be Tippi Tom, Tippi Tom.  Danny, anyone else we could talk to right now?  Yeah, I got this one guy here.  I think his name is Les or something.  Fez, hang on.  Oh, Fez. 
[01:50:30]  Ah.  Yes, from the Ron and Fez show.  He's in denial still.  Yeah.  He still thinks he's not homeless.  Poor guy.  Brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown.  The show on the bus is booze and crap, booze and crap, booze and crap.  I don't think that's the way that song goes.  Are you having a good time, Fez?  Yeah, you know, we just did have a nice moment.  We passed Raleigh Prison in New Jersey.  Yeah.  The homeless got to wave to their friends. 
[01:51:00]  You know, this isn't just about helping the homeless out.  You're near homeless, but it's also about kind of, you know, getting you out and mingling with people.  Yeah.  You know, for some reason, all the homeless have decided to use the bathroom on this trip.  It's a short trip to the lab.  I don't know.  And they all had to go use the bathroom.  The bad part is, there's no toilet on this bus.  I was going to say.  And they all used the bathroom. 
[01:51:30]  I was going to say, I don't remember there being a toilet, but now it makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  I hope it's Steve's stupid laptop bag.  And I do have one complaint.  Yeah.  You know, I was nervous going through the Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah.  You know, we finally got out the other side, hit the light of day.  My brooch was missing.  Where's my brooch?  My brooch was missing.  When the lights came back on, my brooch was gone.  My brooch was missing.  You've got to watch them, Fez.  They're not the most honest people. 
[01:52:00]  No, not at all.  They're used to it.  That's something you're going to have to figure out how to do when you're completely homeless,  is, you know, take advantage of people when they're sleeping or in the dark or something like that.  Exactly.  You know, what's nice is the bus company.  This has got to be the last time they're able to use this bus.  Before they retire it.  It's going to have to be burned.  This bus is going to the yard after this one.  The only use for this bus now is that they're making one of those man-made reefs,  and they dump it in the house. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, a reef.  Like they do with old subway cars.  Yeah.  Yeah, right on.  It'll help the fish.  All right, Fez.  Hang in there.  Hey, can we talk to Kenny?  I want to get a – oh, here he is.  Let's say hi to Kenny and then get an ETA.  Kenny.  Hello.  Hello, fellas.  Hi, Kenny.  Are you hanging in there, buddy?  What's that?  You hanging in there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, we're going smooth.  If there's no traffic, we'll be there 10, 15 minutes.  Oh, wow.  That'd be great.  Oh, my God. 
[01:53:00]  Everything's going good.  We're segregated on the bus.  Segregated?  How do you mean?  Smelly and non-smelly?  Normal people in the back and normal people in the front.  And then Voss.  And then Voss.  They don't know where to place him.  People God loves in the front.  People God doesn't love in the back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So everything's going real good.  All right.  Any other observations, Kenny?  No, I've been concentrating on just, you know, getting us there. 
[01:53:30]  So –  All right.  You know, I leave the funny to you guys.  All right, thank you.  When you jumped off the bus with Jack, what did you say to those traffic people who are  not real cops in New York?  No, I know where I'm going.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Danny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Back to Danny.  He's also on the bus.  Yeah, no kidding.  Danny, what's up?  Well, apparently the similarities between Tippy Tom and Red continue.  Security had to intervene and kind of hold him back because he was trying to get to  me because I have a, quote, nice, round ass.  He won't stop making eye contact with me. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Danny, why don't you show him?  I'm sorry?  Yeah, Danny, moon the homeless, will you?  You want me to show him?  Yeah.  Look, I've seen it in that little Borat bathing suit.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  That is nice.  All right, Danny, go ahead.  Moon the homeless.  Hey, he's trying to grab me.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Hey, wait.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Danny's not drunk enough for that.  No.  No.  What is it going on in the homeless?  What is it going on in the homeless? 
[01:54:30]  Follow that red light suit.  Yeah, Tippy Tom loves it.  You like that, Tippy?  All right, very good.  I like that, Tippy Tom.  Smacked the phone out of my hand.  He smacked the phone out of Danny's hand after he called him Tippy Tom.  All right, Danny, thank you.  All right, guys.  All right, we'll check in.  Well, that's great.  In on the bus in a few minutes here.  There's no traffic, Kenny was saying, about 10 minutes.  I know that there's, we had reports of some traffic going into the mall, so they might 
[01:55:00]  have to deal with that, but the mall, from what we're hearing reports, packed, the parking  lot full of fans waiting for this bus to roll in, and the homeless to come off like rock  stars.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  What an event.  I would love to be there.  By the way, I want to thank the Hard Rock Cafe for feeding the homeless today.  Yes.  In Times Square, 42nd Street, and Broadway.  Also, the red carpet, courtesy of Flemington Department Store.  Isn't that great?  They eat from the Hard Rock, and it comes out the same way, I bet. 
[01:55:30]  And they sleep on the same thing.  Route 31 in Flemington, New Jersey.  And Innovation Luggage at Short Hills Mall donated a bunch of backpacks and lunch bags  for all the homeless.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Very nice of them.  InnovationLuggage.net, I guess, is their website.  Let's go to the mall.  I want to hear from some of the listeners at the mall, if they're listening in right  now.  Let us know what the scene's all about over there.  Oh, my God.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:56:00]  It's Bill from Towns River, a.k.a. Bill and Beth from Paltalk.  As you guys can imagine, it's kind of hard to hear.  The crowd is getting really loud, anticipating the arrival of the bus.  I'm standing here, as a shock to me, I just happen to be next to No Filter Paul and the  retarded Learning, Laverne, and Shirley.  Yeah.  Listen, I didn't ask to be here, but this is where I'm at.  He didn't ask to be here.  I'm going to get a little O and A chant. 
[01:56:30]  All right?  O and A.  That's right.  All right, guys.  Wow.  Anxiously waiting for the arrival of Bill from Towns River.  You figure, what, 10, 15 minutes?  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  So, you know what?  Thank you, Bill.  All right, guys.  We'll wait now.  Just later. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  Won't be long now.  Won't be long now.  Maybe it would be really smart to take a break.  So, when we get back, we'll be back live for the arrival of the bus.  Big moment.  At the mall at Short Hills for the homeless shopping spree.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a sale at Penny's.  Yeah, man.  And a drunk bum running up the escalator.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show homeless shopping spree.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:57:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back to the homeless shopping spree, 2006.  And we're almost there, kids.  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, by the way.  They are at the mall.  They are at the mall.  Where exactly are they, though?  I don't know.  We're going to go to the phones and find out.  Who do you want to talk to?  Rich, Keith, Club Soda Kenny.  Let's start with Keith the Cop.  This is kind of his baby.  Yep. 
[01:58:00]  Keith.  Gentlemen, we all have to Short Hills Falls.  We are currently setting up the walkthrough in the crowd.  We're lining our boys up, and we should be bringing them off the bus in about two minutes.  Now, you got a crowd of people there?  Oh, my God.  I guess so.  I think the listeners found the bus, huh?  As a matter of fact, we do.  All right.  Hold on.  Because we want to do this right on the radio, okay?  Hold on.  Let me talk to Rich Voss really fast. 
[01:58:30]  Rich, what's going on?  It's unbelievable.  This is like a rock concert.  You got to hear this.  It's unbelievable.  I can't even hear you guys.  Listen.  It's all over the place.  And half these fans look homeless themselves.  Rich is killing today.  I can't hear a word.  They can't even hear us.  This could be a problem.  Do we have cameras?  Can you hear?  Yeah.  What's up there, Rich? 
[01:59:00]  I think we're going to do intros.  We're making a path so they can walk right off the bus into them all here.  Yeah.  The security, it's unbelievable.  And they're lining up on the parking garage up on the upper deck there.  Now, we need this to be, when they come off that bus, not too close to the front doors.  We want everybody to be able to see these people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, they can see them.  That's the path.  You know, there's some street, a little street here, sidewalk.  All right.  An old security man. 
[01:59:30]  And how many people are there right now?  Well, you know, they're all into the mall.  Look into the mall.  It goes all.  It's like, I swear to God, walking through here, you're going to feel like Moses.  There's people all the way down the mall, all the way outside the mall here.  You can't even really judge.  Unbelievable.  And these are only the people that can get to this spot.  So you know they're even farther into the mall here.  All right.  We need the pal talkers to turn their cameras on for us because we need to take a look here.  Do we have a mall cam?  The pal talkers have been helping us out today, big time, giving us some pictures. 
[02:00:00]  They're trying to save their batteries.  But if someone pal talker, turn the camera on if you're there.  This is the time to turn it on.  Yeah.  This is, you want the intro.  Yeah.  Deb is saving battery.  For what?  This is the part.  All right.  Hold on, Rich.  I'm going to go back to Keith, the cop.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  All right.  So what's the deal?  We got the, we're just lining them up right now.  And like Kenny and Voss said, I mean, you can't even see the end of the people down the  hallway in the mall.  It's, it's, it's unbelievable. 
[02:00:30]  And they're watching from the parking garages, uh, the levels of the parking garages, the  parking lot.  Uh, it's going to be like rock stars coming off of this bus.  Now, Keith, is this the biggest homeless shopping spree yet?  This could be all the homeless shopping sprees we've done combined.  This is, it's unbelievable.  Wow.  Wow.  Awesome.  Awesome.  We're going to start getting the crew off and then we're going to hit the introductions  in about two minutes.  All right.  There's got to be a hundred people there, though.  It could be a couple more than that, Jim.  Hey, who's going to do the intros today?  Let's get them up to the front.  Who's going to do the intros, Keith? 
[02:01:00]  Uh, I think we're going to pass it around a minute.  I'm going to do a little off and a little.  Wow.  The door must have just opened.  Yep.  The crew's heading off now and we're going to get to the, uh.  Wait, just don't do it yet, Keith.  We got to get the cameras on.  Yeah.  All right.  You're probably not going to be able to hear us during the intros, so we're just going  to plow through it.  We'll, uh, we'll take a break in between each one, but.  Yeah, Keith, just do the best you can.  We're just going to listen in, so don't worry about us.  You know, introduce, uh, each guy, let them get their applause and then move on. 
[02:01:30]  You know what to do.  Don't worry about us.  Just keep going.  Pandemonium.  All right, we're coming.  Hold on, Keith.  We just got to get a camera on if possible.  We're trying to get one of the pal talkers to, uh, pal talkers to turn their camera on.  All right.  All right.  I think we're, uh, we're getting ready to go.  Boss is going to do the first couple introductions. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, they can't hear.  They can't hear.  It's all right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I wish he had a full horn.  Hold on.  Which one's out?  Hey, Keith.  Keith.  Wow.  Uh, I think we need a phone closer to the person that's announcing. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, Rich.  That would help.  Maybe try Rich.  All right.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  All right.  All right.  How's this guy?  His name is big.  Uh-oh.  That's when he goes by, but it's really a zero. 
[02:03:00]  I think he has to say no.  Come on.  Say no.  Wow.  We've got to fill in the blanks.  Obviously, they're introducing the homeless, but there's just way too many people.  They just introduced Big Pop. 
[02:03:30]  Big Pop.  Hold the phone up so we can hear him, too.  Absolutely.  Next off the bus, we have a contestant from W1F in Philly.  All the way from Philly, David.  All right.  We can hear a little better.  Our next contestant, his name is James. 
[02:04:00]  They also fall slow-mo.  Can you remember him from the watermelon, man?  He is James.  James?  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, God.  We tried to get this next contestant.  We tried to get Dave Navarro, but we got stuck with him.  Here he is.  Pop a rock.  Pop a rock.  Pop a rock.  Hold his guitar, Dave.  The fiddler. 
[02:04:30]  Our next contestant, you know, from 14th Street and 8th Avenue, took a crap in his hand for  somebody.  Jake Blue is in the house.  Just introduced Blue, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And next time, do not litter in front of him, because a tear will come from his eye. 
[02:05:00]  Let's have a big hand for, from the top of my head, nickel, Grey Wolf.  Ooh, Grey Wolf's a star.  Grey Wolf.  They love Grey Wolf.  Half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face.  Oh, wait.  Uh-oh.  Half a Hulk face.  He left.  Got it.  Got it.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Half a Hulk face.  I'm doing a damn problem.  Half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face.  I want to have a next contestant. 
[02:05:30]  He says he's not an animal.  Please don't poke him with a snake.  Half a Hulk face.  Half a Hulk face.  What are they saying?  Half a Hulk.  I'll have a Hulk.  They love it.  The phone's obviously having a hard time picking up all this, but...  All right, wait.  He says he's not homeless, but you can see him muttering around the streets of Manhattan. 
[02:06:00]  Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  Yes.  Why am I following half a Hulk face?  Why am I following half a Hulk face?  Yes.  Last but not least, you know him as the original Golden Buns.  He beat Donald.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:06:30]  What, did he smack the phone?  Yeah, I think something went on.  Big Red, everybody.  All right, now they're giving him his real name.  Big Red.  Big Red.  All right.  You can hear us.  That's the end of the intro.  We're going to head into the mall and stop breaking up the group.  We'll check back with you guys in a couple minutes.  All right.  Good job, man.  All right.  Keep the cop, everybody.  Hi, Steve.  How are you?  What's going on with your camera?  Oh, retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[02:07:00]  I hear them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So here's the update.  Let me go to Danny.  Danny's at the mall.  Hey, Danny.  Danny.  We lost Danny?  Yeah.  All right.  So obviously the phone's having a very hard time picking up the sheer amount of sound  that was coming out of the crowd over there while they were introducing the homeless,  getting off the bus, gearing up for the homeless shopping spree inside the mall.  Um, uh, I'm thinking perhaps because, you know, we're doing this live and, uh, on Saturday, 
[02:07:30]  but we will replay this Monday.  Hopefully, uh, Sam has this all taped with his camera and perhaps we could pull the sound  of the intros and them coming off the bus and put that in the place of the, the phone.  Yeah.  Uh, audio so that way it'll sound a lot better, um, on Monday.  Or at the worst, it'll be up on opiananthony.com.  Well, yeah, but I'd like it to sound really nice, uh, on the air on, uh, Monday when we  replay it.  So if, if that's at all possible, of course, that would sound a lot better than just the  phone connection. 
[02:08:00]  But yeah, all this will be the video.  You'll, you'll see the, uh, audio and the photos that, that our, our, uh, uh, people  are taking and the, uh, the fans are taking are going to be all over the place.  So you'll get a really good view and, uh, uh, the sound of what's going on without the  smell, which is good.  We should have sent our own guy.  We, we didn't think we should have sent the Paltalk camera down.  That was something we should have had with Paltalk cameras.  Well, the problem is there's so many people trying to check out the Paltalk, uh, cameras.  A lot of traffic.  Too much traffic.  We can't, we can't get it working, uh, right.  Yes.  Because we want to get a peek at what's going on over there. 
[02:08:30]  Deb's camera seems to be the one that, uh, is the, the one that won't come up.  Right.  And that's the one we really need.  Yeah.  That's the one we kind of need.  She's probably very frustrated too.  I bet she is, but just to give you the visuals, obviously the bus, you know, pulled up to  the mall.  There was just, who knows how many people just sounded like thousands.  I don't know.  We'll, we'll get the numbers later on.  And, uh, you know, as, uh, Keith was introducing these guys one by one, they would step off the  bus and the crowd was just giving them nothing but love.  Let's say hi to Danny.  He's at the mall.  Danny.  Hi guys. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  What's going on, Danny?  Dude, this is unbelievable.  I can't even, I can't even estimate how many people are here for this thing.  There's that many people.  It's like a sea of people.  It just never ends.  Yeah.  Like fill in some of the pictures for us when the, the, the, uh, bus pulled up.  Uh, what, what was, uh, what was going on?  Everybody was just losing their minds.  And you should have seen some of the actual customers of this mall just be absolutely disgusted.  Well, uh, when you guys pulled in, well, was the crowd chasing the bus with a, um, uh, 
[02:09:30]  opening up like the Red Sea?  Well, basically they were, they were like on the side of the entrance and I mean, it  was as far as, you know, as far as you could see, there was people and you know, it looked  like a lot of people and it was, and then we looked inside the entrance and it was just,  it was just flooded with people.  Like it was three times as many people as we thought it was in the first place.  Wow.  So the entire mall.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable here.  How, how many people would you estimate?  Dude, at least 2,500 people.  It was ridiculous.  Oh my God. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  This is easily the biggest one we've ever done.  Yep.  Hey Danny, do these people look like the normal shoppers at the Short Hills Mall?  Oh yeah.  Well, we pulled up, everybody started screaming at the top of their lungs and this couple of,  uh, really old ladies, they almost fell down.  You just don't get it.  Unbelievable.  So.  I've never seen anything like this.  Ooh.  And then as the homeless, like, uh, got off the bus, what was, what was the, the feel?  Uh, it was actually, everybody was really cool.  They were very excited for everybody to come off the bus. 
[02:10:30]  And, uh, these guys, these guys are going to walk away with so much stuff.  I mean, just the amount of people here that are going to buy stuff for these guys.  They're going home with way more than those $200 gift cards we gave them.  Do you know the ovation that stupid Andrew would have gotten if he came off that bus,  that dope?  Yeah.  And the actual tippy-tom.  Yeah.  We're done with Andrew.  Well, dude, he's a homeless guy.  We don't know where it happened to him.  He might've fell asleep.  So he's a, he can't even maintain a house.  Who cares?  We're done with him.  We're so done with him.  That's funny. 
[02:11:00]  He's irresponsible.  Right.  Hey, Danny, have you guys all split up now?  We're done with him.  No, not yet.  We're about to do that.  And what I didn't even realize was as many people as there are on this main floor, I  just looked up and the railing of the second floor is just lined with fans looking down.  Yeah, looking down.  So there's like multiple levels of, of fans that are here.  Boy, these homeless are really going to make out today.  All right, Danny, hold on the line.  I'm going to go to Rich Voss really fast.  It's going to get fast and furious now.  Rich, what's going on?  You got to see the looks on the shoppers' faces. 
[02:11:30]  They're covering like their baby's eyes and stuff.  It's like, they're like, they're like fighting the death.  It's like, it seems like a nuclear war to them.  They're pushing through.  Right now, they're pushing their girls through, like don't talk or touch.  You got to see the regular people.  Hey, Rich, is the mall crowded?  It's unbelievable.  I can't believe that you have picked a short hill's wall.  The only mall where your fans can't afford to buy socks. 
[02:12:00]  It's unbelievable.  They're all going up the escalators.  They're staring.  It's a rock concert in the mall.  And of course, then I got to deal with this guy, Big Red.  Me and Billy.  Me and Mike.  Sorry.  Where's Bill Burr?  Huh?  Yeah, where's Bill Burr?  He was supposed to join us.  That's right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But me and Mike got Big Red here, and people are staring at us.  One call.  The talk girl just walked by and looked at us like, oh my God, here at this mall. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, did we remember the money to give them?  That'd be funny if we stiffed them.  Oops, sorry.  For the rest of the country, we pick a very snooty mall every year.  Yeah.  And this year, it's the mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.  I also have an update coming from the streets of New York here.  Yeah.  This is from a very reliable source of mine.  The race riots have started.  There's a garbage truck or something on fire at 48th between 6th and 7th. 
[02:13:00]  So they've started burning things, people.  Enjoy.  Enjoy the city.  Wow.  Hey, I'm looking at Happy Typing Girls Pal Talk camera.  Anthony, you can finally see the camera.  It is unbelievable how many people I'm looking at at this mall right now.  Unbelievable.  I can't even describe how many people.  Just a wall of people.  It looks like you can't even walk in the actual mall.  Who's that homeless fat Eddie Uts Roland?  We're going to get Big Red.  What? 
[02:13:30]  All right.  All right, Rich, I'm going to put you on hold for a second.  I'm going to go to Than.  Than, what's going on today?  We're still just sort of in the staging area.  I've taken refuge in a diesel store.  You can't even move at this point.  It's ridiculous.  I'm looking at cops, security mall cops.  I wish I could see. 
[02:14:00]  And they're just all on their cell phones.  They're trying to figure out what to do.  I am now looking at a picture of Happy Typing Girls Cam.  It is ridiculous.  No one could walk.  That's how crowded it is right now at the Short Hills Mall.  And then they have a stairway to the second level,  and you can't even walk up the stairs to get to the second level  so you can look down at what's going on today.  Unbelievable.  Dan, is that pretty accurate or what?  I'm sorry?  Never mind.  So you're in the diesel store? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I'm going to try to rat on my guys and get moving  so we're not all just standing around.  All right, very good.  Yeah, we're going to try to split up.  That's what happens every year.  They all go different directions,  so maybe they could get some shopping done.  Oh, these poor people with a baby are trying to get by.  That'll work.  Holy Jesus.  Are you looking at that?  Nice wall.  Isn't that amazing?  Up the stairs, the whole balcony.  Oh, my God.  That is a lot of people. 
[02:15:00]  I'll check back once I get something going, all right?  All right.  Thank you, fan.  Let's say hi to Sam.  He's at the mall with his camera.  Sam, what's going on?  Steve?  It is.  It's a madhouse here.  I took refuge in a store, too,  and all the workers in the stores are just looking,  trying to figure out what's going on  because there's nobody in any of the stores.  But the halls are so crowded, you cannot walk.  These are like disaster phone calls that you get  like when Katrina's happening.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm taking refuge.  There's pandemonium.  Refuge.  Yeah, they told me I couldn't bring my big camera in 
[02:15:30]  that I always use.  Oh, no.  Well, you know what?  There's going to be...  We have several small cameras scattered around the mall,  so we'll have video.  I thought we could use a camera.  What did you say?  I thought we could use a camera.  They won't.  I mean, it's too big to hide,  and it's pretty hardy.  They got smaller cameras.  And I'm not worried.  I mean, we got a lot of pests in there with cameras.  We'll get plenty of video of the event.  Sam, what I want to know is, though,  did you tape the exit from the bus?  Yes, the entrance was taped.  I got off the bus and keep them getting off the bus. 
[02:16:00]  Very good.  How amazing was that?  What was that?  How amazing was that?  It was unbelievable.  I mean, you can't...  There was barely a path to walk.  Moral security had to escort all the homeless off the bus,  as well as our security.  How pissed off are they that they had to escort the homeless into the mall?  Oh, I know.  So, Sam, you got audio of the entrances, right?  Yes.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  Very cool.  All right.  And we'll have lots of video and audio and all that up on the website.  We're getting quick glimpses of what's going on, and it is unbelievable. 
[02:16:30]  I really like...  I don't know who said it before, but all the homeless shopping sprees that we've done in  the past put together is pretty much what this one is.  Yeah.  I've never seen so many people in one place like this, in a mall.  All right.  Let's say hi to Fez.  He's at the mall.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, ONA.  What's up?  This thing is gigantic.  I can't believe this.  This many people show up for the homeless.  If this many people showed up for the homeless every day, we wouldn't have homeless. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They kind of forget about them, and then we put on a little event, and thousands show  up to see a few of these people.  And treat them like rock stars for an afternoon.  Yeah.  Now they're just beloved.  Don't worry.  Come Monday, they'll be getting kicked and spit on again.  They'll go back to normal.  All the stuff that the people bought them will be stolen from them.  So I got teamed up with Slow Motion, which I really appreciate. 
[02:17:30]  Give me the slowest shopper possible to keep this going on.  Is it like shopping with mother?  It just takes forever?  Yes, exactly.  And I know we're going to be trying on stuff.  What's nice is that such a huge crowd, Slow Motion actually just went into the first store  he saw.  Oh, really?  What store was that?  Victoria's Secret?  He's in Foot Locker.  In Foot Locker.  Oh, they got to be thrilled to have a homeless guy trying on shoes today. 
[02:18:00]  They all need shoes.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, exactly.  Have a few hundred pairs of socks ready before he comes in.  Oh, yeah.  Disposable for sure.  Fez.  Hey, Fez, can you move around?  It's really hard to move around.  I mean, the Foot Locker, they followed us in here and it's just packed.  And I'll tell you what.  Everyone say hey to all of that.  That's just one store, by the way.  One cell.  That's one little cell, right. 
[02:18:30]  All right, Fezzy, hold on.  We're going to check in with, you got, huh?  We lose them?  All right, let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Well, I'm here with Papa Rock in a very nice sunglass store.  And Papa Rock is making his very first purchase of the day.  Okay.  He's buying $90 Ray-Bans.  See?  We only gave him $200.  I told him, I said, are you sure you want those?  And he said yes.  And he took out his gift card and he's making the purchase as we speak. 
[02:19:00]  $90 Ray-Bans.  What an idiot.  Good.  His eyebrows will be warm during the winter months.  Well, I'm sure a fist will take care of those.  He'll play some of that awful music and wake somebody.  And a nice fist will remove his Ray-Bans.  Someone's just going to punch him in his Ray-Bans.  $90 Ray-Bans on a homeless guy.  This is how stupid these people are.  God bless.  That's why they're homeless.  How about just getting a $3 hat and $20 gloves.  And some gloves and boots and a Cartwright jacket. 
[02:19:30]  To keep it nice and warm.  And then maybe $20 sunglasses.  Yeah, then you get some cheap sunglasses if the sun is bothering you.  He's going for a look.  Yeah.  He's homeless, but he wants to look good.  Can we say hi to Papa Rock?  Uh, let me try to get to the other side.  So he's like, no.  I can't even move.  Excuse me, guys.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  Hey, Papa Rock.  The guys want to talk to you, okay?  Yeah.  Hey, Papa Rock.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  You bought Ray-Bans.  Huh?  You bought some Ray-Bans.  Ray-Bans?  Ray-Bans.  You bought sunglasses with your...  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  You bought sunglasses.  Don't you think there's some better things you can buy than sunglasses?  That's okay, right?  Yeah, whatever you want.  Like stuff to keep warm with during the winter?  All right.  We've got to let them go. 
[02:20:30]  Just eat them.  Yeah, just eat the glasses.  Listen, they all are completely incapable of communicating on a telephone.  They are incapable.  They've talked to nobody but sheriffs and bill collectors on the phone.  Right.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss again.  Rich.  Hey, we're at Timberland and we're getting big red.  We're getting big red, too.  And people doing $140.  Wow.  Listen, this is how generous the O&A fans are. 
[02:21:00]  They said we want to get big red, Timberlands, and they started throwing $20.  Wow.  See, they're just drowning out Rich Voss, but basically they're throwing money at big red  so he can get his Timberlands.  This is what happens.  We give each of the homeless a certain amount of money.  I didn't even know what it is.  Yeah.  But we give them a certain amount of money and they can spend it on whatever they want.  But the real cash comes from the listeners.  They just throw money at these guys when they go to these stores. 
[02:21:30]  And like he was just saying, he wanted a pair of Timberlands.  That's good for a homeless guy.  A nice pair of Timberlands.  And the listeners paid for it.  At least red is buying boots.  Yeah, I know.  Dope.  I just paid with a credit card.  So now I got $140.  No.  Freaking rich.  Rich is going home with some money today.  Give him the cash, Voss.  Buy it.  Hey, Voss.  Oh, watch.  What do you want?  Pants right now?  Pants and a sweater.  No, listen.  Oh, God.  Yes, no.  Red. 
[02:22:00]  Red needs pants.  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  It's metal.  Unbelievable.  That's horrible.  We want to thank the people at Timberlands.  Thank you, man.  Why won't them all out, pal talk?  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  You don't have to file on me because I got the money in my hand.  All right.  Hold on, Rich.  We'll get back to you in a second.  Let's go to Than.  Than, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, Blue went instantly practical by buying a boombox at Sharper Image. 
[02:22:30]  A boombox.  Wow.  That's going to be a boombox when it careens into the side of his head one night when he's sleeping.  Yeah, it's great because you can hook your iPod right into it.  Good.  Well, good.  Good for him.  I love these guys.  They are unbelievable.  They're not practical.  Oh, I love it.  They're not all practical.  I absolutely love it.  Why does he buy a bathing suit while he's having it?  Why are we surprised?  We're not surprised.  They're dopey.  And then they go back on the mean streets in New York with their brand new shiny freaking 
[02:23:00]  boombox.  Boombox.  And it just gets stolen.  My God.  Anything else, Dan?  Yeah, it says right on the price tag to ask about their three-year replacement service  guarantee.  What happens if you come back and there's a boot hole in it and a Michelin bottle has been  smashed against it?  Does the warranty cover that?  What happens if it gets broken over my head while I'm sleeping?  Pull a few of his last remaining teeth out of the speakers. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  I'm moving on.  Let's go to Club Soda, Kenny.  Kenny, what's going on, buddy?  You can't imagine the crowd that's at this mall.  Thanks, Kenny.  Wow, Kenny.  How come they won't allow them to use PalTalk?  What's the problem?  They got to do what they got to do.  I don't know.  What do they got to do?  What is that?  Who knows?  They're shutting down the PalTalkers.  I got a guy, Benny, at mall with PalTalk trying to broadcast, but I got bounced, so I don't  know.  We'll figure it out.  I don't understand what the problem is with PalTalk. 
[02:24:00]  Didn't they say we could use cameras there?  I thought so.  Get Kenny back on.  They also didn't expect who knows how many thousands of people to show up.  Yeah, but we want to get captured on tape.  Yeah.  Well, people are going to be using their video phones and everything.  Hey, Elmo.  My brother's on the phone.  What's up, bro?  Well, I'm following you on a couple more walks, and I'll win the Foot Locker, which, of course,  is the first stop to open these bums.  And we have a lot of the black bag.  He is going to match the funds of our bum-bombing dude. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  Oh, he's at the Foot Locker, because he said a lot of the homeless start out there getting  some shoes.  And one of the people, one of the fans are matching the funds.  Oh, matching the funds?  Yeah.  Fans are matching funds at the Foot Locker.  Very cool.  Let's go back to, yeah, Club Soda County.  Kenny.  Yeah.  So how many people?  I mean, you're good at estimating crowds.  I tell you, it's standing room only.  This mall is packed.  Everybody with a baby stall has banned in the mall because there's no place to even walk. 
[02:25:00]  It's incredible the kind of crowds you got here.  And it's on both levels, too, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It would be a teary-eyed if you were here to see this.  A teary-eyed.  The smell.  Right, yeah.  He's talking about the smell.  All right.  Anything else to report, Kenny?  No, no.  I'm with...  All right.  We lost Kenny.  This is going to happen all afternoon.  A place for the phones.  Yeah, let's go to Roland.  Roland, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, Roland. 
[02:25:30]  Describe the scene, Roland.  It's pretty much in a foot walker and I've loaded people everywhere.  And a homeless guy leaning on all the nice, clean t-shirts, stinking them up.  A homeless guy's leaning on all the nice sneakers.  Oh, stinking them up in t-shirts.  Yeah.  Buying shoes.  Buying shoes.  A lot of people.  A lot of people, yes.  People, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Kenny yelling at them.  And then he's playing shoes. 
[02:26:00]  All right.  A lot of people.  It's amazing that he can't even get excited in a mall with no.  But Roland delivers information like he's just picking up little keywords in sentences.  Yeah.  Someone's scrolling it by him.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss again.  Voss.  Hey, listen.  He wanted to go get pants, but we brought him into Louis Vuitton.  Right now he's looking at a tie, a nice Louis Vuitton.  He's a salesperson.  He doesn't want anything to do with him.  And all the people.  You've got to see their faces.  All the Asian people scattered out of here.  It looked like there was a monster attacking. 
[02:26:30]  My friend here would like to try out a tie.  He's got a big engagement to go to at the Port Authority this weekend.  How much is this tie right here?  $180.  If he buys a $180 tie.  I would say, even though you're homeless and you have nothing in life, $180 tie will make  you big on the search.  Okay? 
[02:27:00]  Hey, should we get him a tie for $180?  No!  I say, you know what?  Leave it.  Okay, we're going to leave it.  We'll leave it, Todd.  He doesn't want to have a tie.  All right.  He decided against the tie.  All right.  Thank you, boss.  Let's go back to Thane.  We're just going all over the mall now.  Thane, what's up?  Find him hanging from it.  I'm here at Shrop Image with Blue's new boom box. 
[02:27:30]  A listener was kind enough to chip in and pay for it for him.  How much?  $100.  $100.  So he's got his boom box.  Blue's got his boom box.  And he's still got his cash, which is good because I'm sure their gift cards, they're going  to want to use it for liquor later on.  Yeah.  They seem to enjoy that.  And if they could maybe go out for a little late lunch, early dinner at one of the restaurants  in the mall.  Well, if you remember from past homeless shopping sprees, Ant, a few of the guys go, you know  what?  I don't feel like shopping. 
[02:28:00]  They go right to the bar.  I wonder if a couple have made it to the bar at the mall.  It does happen.  Well, a lot of them want to save it for the next day and do a brunch.  They're going to have a little brunch.  Let's say hi to Steve.  First time Steve's checking in at the mall.  Steve, what's up?  Just got done footlocker.  James, aka Slow Motion, just got a brand new pair of shoes.  Surprisingly enough, they don't hold on to their old shoes after they get their new  ones.  Yeah, where are the old shoes?  In the trash.  Biohazard.  Those would be a collector's item on the Opie and Anthony's circuit. 
[02:28:30]  Salmon Ekbe.  What, Steve?  Oh, my God.  Like at one point, at one point, the other guy, I think his name is, oh, he popped up  his shoe, like, and Jeff made him pick up his socks, and his ranted, busted up foot came  out, and it just fucked up the whole place.  Oh, that is awesome.  Oh, and now it looks like we're moving on from this place.  All right, Steve.  We'll check in.  Yeah, I think Slow Motion wants some jeans.  Want some jeans?  Oh, man. 
[02:29:00]  And they locked us in the footlocker.  What do you mean they locked you in?  The gate went down.  The gate went down, and we're locked in.  Why are you locked in?  That's odd.  Well, I mean, I think they wanted to keep everybody else out.  Oh.  So now I guess we have to make our way.  We're caged animals.  Oh, wow.  They had to pull the gate down to keep people out of footlocker.  They thought a bear got loose.  No, I'm a person.  I know it's Jersey, and there's bears.  Very cool, man.  All right.  Very cool.  All right, Steve.  Hold on a line.  We're going to make sure you get out of footlocker. 
[02:29:30]  Make sure they get that gate back up.  Let's say hi to Fezzy again.  Fezzy.  Hi, ONA.  Hi, Fez.  I'm very far from my home.  I don't live here.  I'm not supposed to be here.  Don't get nervous.  Get yourself some church pants.  Some warm things.  And now I'm locked in a footlocker.  I don't know if Steve told you or not.  They take that locker part pretty seriously, I guess.  They lock you in.  They really do.  This was nice. 
[02:30:00]  We got slow motion pair of shoes, a new pair of kicks.  As the homeless kids say.  Yeah.  And he had to ask for a size 10 and a size 13.  Oh, God.  Because his feet are different sizes?  Yes.  Yes.  For one pair of shoes.  They're chanting, let us out.  Let us out.  It sounds like Rikers.  They're chanting, let us out.  Attica.  Attica.  Let us out.  It's a prison movie.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, it's just like Cuckoo's Nest.  So, we're at last.  We're out of the footlock.  All right.  That's why I uncaged them.  Yeah, I don't think they're going to do that again.  All right.  Thank you.  I could see if half a Hulk face was in there and they want to put the gate down and charge  admission to raise the curtain.  My treasurer.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, Rob.  I can't wait for the bill from Short Hills Mall to CBS Radio, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Rob, what's up?  No, I got to tell you guys something.  Two and a half hours. 
[02:31:00]  I just had to leave, right?  Yeah.  Because there's so much action there that you can't even get close to it at this point.  Yeah.  But the best part about this whole thing, and I don't know if you guys are getting pictures  of this, but it's the old men and old women standing on the steps and on the second  they're asking, like, what's going on and explaining it to them.  And when they figure out what's happening, the look of disgust on their face.  And they just can't believe that something so terrible happens in a town that's so happy.  No, dude, here's what you tell them.  If old people ask you what it is, say it's a gathering of HIV-positive people who want 
[02:31:30]  to be allowed to shop there.  Absolutely brilliant.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, thank you.  The fans are checking in like crazy from all over the ball.  Let's say hi to Luke in Jersey.  Actually, I think Luke's trying to get to the mall.  Luke?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Luke?  Oh, man.  I'm on 78.  The line is incredible.  You're where?  I'm on 78 trying to get into the mall.  The line is incredible.  You can't even get into the mall at this point?  You can't even get anywhere close.  Wow.  It's ridiculous.  I think we've pretty much shut down the mall at Short Hills today. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, thank you, sir.  We're going to go back to Roland.  Roland, what's up?  Hey, I'm here with Brother Elmo.  What?  He's here with Brother Elmo.  Oh, all right.  What's up?  I speak Roland.  We're still stuck in the footlocker.  This one guy, Marcus, he looks like Robin Williams in every dramatic role he's ever played.  That's who he looked like.  I said that.  I said that.  Oh, you did say that?  Yeah, yeah.  See, I wasn't listening either, Jimmy.  We're going to hear a lot of different things when we...  He keeps sending the shoes back.  What?  What?  He keeps sending the shoes back.  Different sizes, different styles. 
[02:32:30]  Very uppity.  Oh, good for him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's trying them on and sending them back?  His dirty feet.  He's making a very, very cute footlocker go look for her money, man.  Holy cow.  She's going to need three showers.  Oh, that poor girl.  So the guy, wait.  He's trying on two different size shoes and he doesn't like them and he's giving them back.  He's sending them back and he wants new ones to come out.  You know when you're uppity and you just sit there and want to be weighted on and you don't like the style of shoe and bring me a new shoe.  This one's too tight.  So he's being picky. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  And Henry Lister just went up and started pushing his toe just like mommy used to do in the store.  Does it fit?  He's looking fit.  All right.  You press where his big toe is supposed to be and you just feel something crunched down like a dried up cracker.  Just break his toe.  Leprosy, yeah.  I mean break his toenail right off his foot.  That big thing looks like a wise rippled potato chip.  It looks like a cornflake with like a little bit of glue under it. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  We're going to have to take a break.  Thank you, Brother Elmo.  Before we take a break, let's say hi to Sam who's with Blue.  Sam, what's up?  Yeah, we're in Timberland right now with Blue.  Yeah.  Trying to get some boots.  They brought in an 11 1⁄2 in the style he wanted and he said he wasn't going to be able to fit.  So he's trying to pick out another style.  Oh, he's trying another style.  Okay.  He's got a ton of fans out here.  They're following Blue around.  They're cheering him.  Trying to get their pictures with Blue.  Yeah, the homeless love taking pictures with the homeless.  Has anyone, who's with half a Hulk face?  I think Danny has half a Hulk face.  Danny? 
[02:34:00]  We'd love to hear from Danny and how the fans are treating half a Hulk face and what he's buying.  Yeah, we'll do that next.  Thank you, Sam.  We should take a break.  We're in the middle of the homeless shopping spree 2006.  What a success so far.  So far, so good.  Want to hear from more of the fans that are at the mall.  We'll check in with Danny and the rest of the gang in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  We could have a problem.  Uh-oh, he might be dead. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, I hope he didn't kill the homeless guy.  It's the Opie and Anthony homeless shopping spree.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Here's my mic.  My pants down.  Thanks for hitting my mic.  Yeah, we're in the middle of the homeless shopping spree 2006 on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Derek just made fun of my pants.  Oh, they just saw me with my pants down on Pal Talk.  You came running out of the bathroom with your, uh, pulling your pants up, zipping, and buckling your belt.  And then Derek was making fun of my pants because I have zippers on the back pockets.  Do you really?  Yeah, I didn't even know. 
[02:35:30]  What a fruit.  I don't buy my pants.  I mean him for noticing.  You didn't know you had zippers on your pants?  On the back pockets.  I have, apparently I have zippers on them.  You had no idea.  I feel, no, I don't buy my clothes.  What are you putting?  Yeah, but you, you, you, you put on your own clothes and you're walking around.  Yeah, but I just kind of look at the front and then by the time I put them on, what do you think?  I look in the mirror like girls do and over my shoulder on a full length mirror and look  at my ass?  Oh yeah.  What's the design on the back pocket?  You get a design on the back pocket.  Like a little, it looks like a half a club, like a, like on, on, on a, on a playing card. 
[02:36:00]  Uh, these pants are officially gay.  I'm, I'm destructing my girlfriend to never buy these again.  Yeah.  Next time buy them assless chaps.  They're more masculine.  What do you say?  Ew.  Ew.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  We might have to send, we might have to, uh, put out an all points bulletin to get you  some jeans at, uh, the mall at Short Hills.  My pants are officially gay.  You're going to stop shopping in Chelsea for your clothes.  Go into Soho, go to Diesel or something.  All right, listen, let's go to no filter Paul. 
[02:36:30]  We got to get right back into this.  The phones are nuts.  It's the home of shopping spree, 2006 at the mall at Short Hills.  It's, uh, no filter Paul checking in.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, guys, I'm in Macy's and we're homeless.  Fez and Dave and, uh, your brother Elmo.  And they're all looking for jeans and, and coats.  And it's 75 people trying to help them find the right size to shut.  So it's pretty out of hand in here.  At Macy's.  At Macy's, huh?  At Macy's, we're getting people just giving us scares of like, what in the hell are you  people doing here? 
[02:37:00]  It's like a swarm of bees going through here.  That's pretty cool.  That's good at buying clothes.  That's what you should buy.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Well, see, this, this shows you the cross section of the homeless.  Some of them actually have sense enough to buy some clothes and others get, uh, Ray-Bans  and, uh, boom boxes.  Yeah.  So far, what have they, uh, purchased?  Yeah.  Some Timberlands, uh, Ray-Bans and a boom box.  Uh, let's say hi to Danny.  He's with half a Hulk face at the mall.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Good. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I actually went outside because my phone was having some trouble getting a signal in there.  But, uh, after, uh, after we activated the gift cards, because obviously they weren't,  uh, we, uh, half a Hulk face made a beeline for the Apple store.  Why, does he want to put one on the other side of his face to even it out?  I know.  He just, he just got himself, uh, $25 worth of iTunes.  Wait a minute.  What's he going to play them on? 
[02:38:00]  I guess, I, I said, do you have an iPod?  And he's like, yeah.  Are people following him around?  Yeah.  So, he's got a crowd of people around him.  Like I said, unfortunately, I had to run outside because my, my cell was, was crap.  Hey, Danny, see if we can get somebody else in there.  Is there anybody else with you that we could get on the cell phone, like, from that location  with him?  I'll try.  I'm going to have to run back inside.  All right.  See if we can get him on the phone with, through someone else's cell phone.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Thanks, Danny.  Yep.  All right.  Yeah.  If you're following half a Hulk face around, uh, give us a call.  Let's say hi to Than.  Than, what's up?  Uh, we're on Foot Locker.  Uh, buying sensible shoes for Graywolf. 
[02:38:30]  Sensible shoes.  What are the, they don't sell moccasins there, do they?  No.  Moccasin locker.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, what, what is he getting?  Boots or, uh, something, something good for the winter?  Just some sort of high top sneaker.  Oh.  All right.  Are you guys all split up at this point?  Yeah.  They're actually, I guess the policy here is to close the metal gate after the homeless get  in here.  So, there's a whole bunch of, uh, fans just waiting to get in outside.  The homeless are shopping like Paris Hilton, uh, shops. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  And like big celebrity shop.  They go in the stores and the stores close down.  Exclusive service just for that person.  You know, security got together and had all sorts of meetings.  Oh, you know it.  And this is what they decided.  Okay, when one of the homeless goes into one of the stores.  You'll close the gate.  Pull down the gate.  This will keep the crowds from, uh, coming in and perhaps having an inventory loss.  Then when the homeless want to leave, lift the gate again and release them.  I got to tell you, the gang at the mall at Short Hills, uh, showing they got to get, you  know, a good sense of humor so far. 
[02:39:30]  And they got their, uh, security together.  Yeah.  They're doing the catch and release program with the, uh, with the homeless.  Let's go to Nick in Jersey.  Nick, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  I was just in the, in the mall and the look of disgust on some of these people's faces  when they ask what's going on and you tell them.  Yeah.  They think there's famous people there.  And one of the homeless guys screamed in his little kid's face when he was coming in  the door.  What'd he say?  Yeah.  What did he say?  He just yelled in his face.  Just, ah!  Good.  Absolutely frightened.  Kid'll have nightmares forever. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I'm sure it smelled wonderful.  All right.  Very good.  Let's go to Steve from, uh, Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What am I doing?  You're in my effin' mall.  Frunkus!  Frunkus.  I haven't heard many frunkuses today.  I, I, I, I, I want to know if there's a frunkus eye.  A frunkus eye.  That's the proper plural.  Frunk eyes.  I, uh, I want to know if there's a Santa Claus in there.  Oh, yeah, man.  If there's a, uh, a mall Santa.  And I want pictures to be taken.  Yeah, definitely. 
[02:40:30]  Uh, Drew, what's up?  Drew.  Hey.  What do you got, Drew?  Hey, you're on the air, idiot.  All right.  He lost his chance.  Let's say hi to Keith the cop.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I'm with, uh, the Big Red and, uh, Big O with Rich Voss.  Uh, Big, uh, Big O just got himself a nice leather jacket.  It costs about $250, courtesy of, uh, the fan that, uh, Rich Voss wants to let us know.  He put 50 of it in.  Wow. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, that's pretty cool.  A nice leather, huh?  Yeah, he's going to be submitting, uh, uh, an expense report, he's all.  Of course he will.  It's tax-deductible.  It's tax-deductible.  Hey, Keith, is there a mall Santa?  Uh, yeah, we're going to try and make our way over there.  Oh, good.  And I think these people really believe that Big Red is tippy-com.  He's not making out with girls.  He's not making out with girls.  I'm telling you, he's kissing girls in the wall, bro.  And they're giving him $20 to do it.  Dude.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:41:30]  Why?  Would you kiss a Petri dish for $20?  These must be some slobs.  But, yeah, I think there's like three groups in Macy's right now.  We're trying to move out.  We're going to head towards the Santa, and I'll give you guys a call back.  Oh, we got to get half a Hulk face on Santa's lap.  Yeah, I want half a Hulk face on Santa's lap.  Yeah, that is the photo op right there.  That is the Christmas moment.  Absolutely.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys, I think this is better.  I'm on Billy's phone.  Yeah, perfect.  Good.  Actually, I'm with half a Hulk face.  We're in a boot store, and he's trying on shoes. 
[02:42:00]  There's a theme here.  A lot of homeless guys getting the new boots.  Getting the boots.  He's getting one for his chin.  He really wanted Doc Martens, but we didn't see any yet,  so I think he's going to have to settle for something else.  Well, he should call Doc Kevorkian to get that face fixed.  All right, it looks like the homeless are settling in and getting their shopping done.  Doing some shopping.  We've had some irresponsible purchases.  Danny.  Yeah.  Did you hear, what's his name?  Who's the rocker? 
[02:42:30]  Papa Rock.  With Papa Rock.  Did you hear what Papa Rock bought?  Well, didn't he get sunglasses?  Yeah, yeah.  The $80 Ray-Bans.  Hey, how far are you from the mall Santa?  I don't know.  I haven't seen him yet, actually.  So I'm going to try and find him right after Hulk Face makes his next purchase.  Yeah, because we really want Hulk Face to take a picture with these Santa Claus.  Did you see a Hulk Face in half a Santa hat on Santa's lap?  Yeah, get him a Santa hat.  Get him a Santa hat.  I will try and find one.  That's going to be my next point. 
[02:43:00]  Because sometimes they have those little kiosks in the mall where you can get a Santa hat and have like,  you know how they put the glue and glitter, a name on there?  Try to get him to put half a Hulk Face on the front.  Or half Hulk?  Half Hulk, whatever.  Half Hulk Face.  Yeah.  Half dash A dash Hulk.  Half a Hulk.  And sit on Santa's lap with that hat.  If you can make that happen, Danny, God damn, you're the best.  I'm going to try my damn disappointment.  Thank you, Danny.  Let's say hi to Ron.  He's at the mall, one of the listeners. 
[02:43:30]  Ron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  What are you seeing over there?  All right.  Well, I'm above where the footlocker is where they have a homeless person in at the moment.  But they need to go on the second level above to an MAC.  They do makeovers.  We have to bring half a Hulk Face into here.  This will be hilarious.  For a makeover?  Oh, my God.  What, like makeup?  And what do they do?  How would they give a guy a makeover?  Oh, I'm really not sure.  But if they have these people in here, the workers, they just look like transvestites to begin with. 
[02:44:00]  I just want to see the horrified look on their face when they don't know what the hell to do.  Shamesaw.  They come out with ball-peen hammers and chisels.  Hey, Ron, thanks for the idea.  We're going to get one of the guys up there.  Half a Hulk Face for your makeover.  Yeah, definitely.  What's better than that?  Let's go to Voss.  Voss, what's up?  Your guy just bought a leather blazer?  Yeah, we just got him a leather blazer and a nice T-Can-Y sweater.  He's the best-dressed homeless person I've ever seen.  They said you chipped in $15.  What's that?  They said you chipped in $15. 
[02:44:30]  $50.  I put in $50 out of my pocket.  And also, I got a coupon for some Jewish kid.  And we went past this little girl who was crying when we walked by.  I think she recognized me.  It's tuckering out right now.  It's like he's almost out of it.  He wants you to be out of the house.  He can't even barely walk.  Here, talk to Mike real quick.  All right.  Hello, boys.  What's up?  My man, Randy, is scared.  What?  He's on his last leg.  Oh, he's on his last leg?  Oh, man, we walked him to death. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, he hasn't walked this far in a long time.  Oh, boy.  He needs to be a forthwith.  Yeah, by the way, by the time they get back on the bus, these guys are out cold.  They're exhausted.  It's a long day for them.  They're like little children all falling asleep in the back seat, coming home from a holiday out.  All right.  We'll check in with you guys a little bit.  Let's go to Steve C.  He's with Slow Motion.  Steve C., what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  We just got out of Macy's, and we were getting these guys some pants. 
[02:45:30]  I had no idea until we got to the register how little money that Slow Motion still had on his card left,  because the woman at the register looked at me and said, you don't have enough money.  You don't have enough money.  All this guy had bought was a pair of shoes.  I looked at the receipt in my pocket.  His sneakers cost $175.  He bought $175 sneakers?  You idiot.  This guy's going to get so mugged so quickly.  I'm going to mug him.  I'd love to have those.  Why?  No idea.  What am I asking why for? 
[02:46:00]  Same reason the other guy bought a boombox.  Exactly.  I had no idea.  So we got him a cheap pair of jeans and a pair of shoes on a fan.  It's a really expensive pair of shoes, and now he's all cleaned out.  And now he's out of money.  He's got a $175 sneaker.  Steve, are you going to buy him anything?  And when we walked into Macy's, everybody thought it would be real cute to go to the perfume counter and cover us all in women's perfume.  So we all smell like some weird combination of obsession, dracar, and God knows what. 
[02:46:30]  And homeless ass.  Yeah, and homeless armpits.  And I can't help, and I really can't thank Anthony and Jim enough for starting this one.  I can't walk two feet in any direction without hearing a grr or a, or a, or a, or that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That was a good one.  Anyway.  Are they grring at you, Steve?  Yeah.  They're grring him?  Grr.  Grr.  There he goes.  All right, Steve. 
[02:47:00]  We're going to go with Sam.  He's with Blue trying to get a picture with Santa.  Sam.  Yeah.  What's going on?  We're trying to get a picture.  Blue really wants a picture with Santa Claus.  Who wouldn't?  Santa's on break.  Oh, Santa's on break.  Of course it is.  Conveniently, Santa went on break?  What is that about?  I've knocked him some boots so far.  Don't make the listeners start a chant where Santa's sitting.  Where is Santa?  How long is his break?  Big Blue, let's holler.  Blue is shouting at me. 
[02:47:30]  I can't hear you.  Is there a sign that says Santa will return January 5th?  I know.  The crowd is, again, the crowd is huge.  Poor Sam.  Blue has made $50 so far panhandling to the people here.  He's got cash in his pocket.  They're buying him, they bought him a boombox already.  Yeah.  Panhandling.  Blue is more than any other hobo.  Oh, that's great.  Hobo.  Jesus, Sam.  When they get back in the bus, it'll be fun to really find out what these guys bought.  Yeah, what they got. 
[02:48:00]  It's hard right now, but when they get back in the bus, it'll be very clear what they ended  up buying.  All right, Sam, we'll check in with you in a little bit.  We're going to go to, let's see, let's go to Nurse Heather.  Nurse Heather.  Hey, no, it's not Nurse Heather.  A different one.  But I'm at the mall.  We're outside the sunglass store.  Um, I can't see who's in there, but everyone's out here.  One store shut the doors on them.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that seems to be policy today.  They just don't, they'll probably worry about getting ripped off. 
[02:48:30]  They can't watch everybody.  Yeah.  You know, all these mistrances.  Yeah, I think that's, that's probably what the biggest problem is.  They don't want, uh, they don't want to be shock lifted from it.  But they are, they seem to be handling it okay.  Anything else, Nurse Heather?  No, they're just buying sunglasses now, and they hit up Foot Locker already.  Okay.  Thank you.  We're going to check in with Black Earl.  Earl, what's up?  Earl.  Hi, Earl.  What's up, Earl?  Yeah, we're, we're buying sunglasses for everyone right now.  I mean, the place is absolutely jammed. 
[02:49:00]  We tried to buy some pants, but we couldn't have, find his size.  Couldn't find his size?  Yes.  You got to go to a, uh, tall and portly, uh, store?  He's a 40-30.  Yeah, we did.  We could have to find his size.  The best part of this is, like, when you walk through, there's our listeners who are  completely packed out the place, and the looks of horror from the regulars, it's priceless.  This one girl, she just had this, it looked like a very permanent look on her face, it's 
[02:49:30]  just like, eh.  And she just, and she couldn't break it.  It's like, everyone's laughing, everyone's having a good time.  Yeah, no one can really understand how upper crust this, uh, mall is.  They would rather have zombies in that mall, like, uh, Dawn of the Dead, or one of those  zombie movies at the mall, than they would the homeless.  All right, Earl, thank you.  We got to go right to Roland, because Roland is, uh, saying that his bum is very picky.  Roland!  Hey, yeah, I'm with Marcus, uh, most picky. 
[02:50:00]  He tried on five jackets before he bought it.  Five jackets were destroyed before he picked one.  And then he tried on, like, five different hats, and he goes, I don't want a hat.  Oh, he tried on hats?  Ew!  Are they just crawling on the floor now?  Yeah, the hats are crawling away.  The hats are moving.  They're shoplifting themselves.  He was calling me, but shopping made him thirsty, so here at Starbucks.  What was that, Roland?  Just shopping made him thirsty.  Shopping made him thirsty? 
[02:50:30]  Thirsty.  Well, maybe they could go to one of the, uh, restaurants that are there, uh, in the mall  and sit down and maybe grab something to eat real quick and something to drink and, uh...  Get a soda pop.  And, uh, yeah, and, uh, get back to shopping.  Yeah, but he wants a Starbucks.  Uh, oh, he wants a Starbucks?  All right.  Thank you, Roland.  We're going to go back to Danny.  Uh, half a Hulk face, uh, looks like a listener is buying him, uh, boots for $200.  Yeah, he decided on, uh, $200 boots, and, uh, one of our fine listeners decided he was  going to pick up the tab, and then some.  I think he's getting him, uh, some nice big socks to go along with those boots. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  Wow, that is really cool.  Yeah, so...  My listeners are really nice, and I almost hate that.  And that ass, Matt, what was his name?  Noyes, who said that we were just going to be exploiting them?  And here all these people are buying them clothes and having fun with them and not abusing them  and treating them nice.  Thousands of people treating them like rock stars.  Taking pictures with them, giving them money.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're rock stars for a day.  And so what?  They make fun of how they smell a little bit and, you know, how goofy and stupid they  are buying stupid items like boom boxes.  Big deal.  I love this one guy who's picky, though.  Yeah.  The one guy's picky. 
[02:51:30]  He's picky.  He's a fuss budget.  A fuss budget.  All right, Danny.  Yeah, these guys are making out really well, and everybody's behaving.  That's going to be working out better.  Danny, how about have a Hulk face?  Two things.  Small Santa and makeover.  Yeah, actually.  Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.  We're going to try and find the mall Santa, so hopefully we can get that done.  Yeah, we hear he's on a break.  You make sure this isn't no bull crap break, and he's really on a break.  Yeah, we might have to start a chant until Santa reappears there.  And find out where the makeover thing is. 
[02:52:00]  You have to get a makeover.  Have a Hulk face.  We heard it's upstairs.  All right, you know what?  Maybe we'll try and hit the makeup counter at Bloomy's.  All right, cool.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Let's go to Alan.  Alan, what's up?  Hey, we actually just left the mall.  The entrance from 24 is closed off by the cops.  Wow.  They have shut the mall.  They have two cop cars blocking up the entrance.  Wow, the mall's closed.  We just closed down the mall until we leave. 
[02:52:30]  We saw all the guys come in.  Next time, can you put name tags on these guys so we know who to cheer for?  Yeah, absolutely.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, we forgot the bullhorn, unfortunately, so I'm sorry about that.  Well, thanks a lot, guys.  All right, let's go to Jay.  He was at the mall.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  I just left the mall.  And the dumbfounded, rich, snooty crowd is like, oh, there must be some football player  here because it's all just a bunch of guys.  Some football player.  The mall is so snooty, they don't even have a food court. 
[02:53:00]  If you want to eat in this mall, you need a reservation.  Even the old people there recognize it's a sausage fest.  Great job.  Punch it out.  All right, let's go back to – oh, Kenny's checking in, too.  Cool.  Let's go to Than first.  Than, what's up?  Oh, this is the portion of the trip where they'll almost go to the john.  To the john.  Oh, it's the bathroom trip.  Okay.  Dude, the clean mall bathrooms, they love them.  Yeah.  Blue is just – he's just a crowd favorite.  He works the crowd. 
[02:53:30]  He gets them to sing.  You want to try to get them to do a sing-along?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go, Blue.  Come on, y'all.  Blue, all the birds, this is a challenge of the pretty.  What song is he singing?  Dino Bell, Blue.  The blue doesn't let not knowing the words stop him at all.  He didn't know the words to Silent Night either, that dope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, we're going to head into the can, and then we'll try to get some more fun going. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Thank you, Fan.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey, Rob.  Yo.  Go ahead real fast, Rob.  Yeah, Fan has been on break since 2 o'clock, man.  Ever since he heard you guys were coming.  Yeah, he better get back out there.  It's a little sign that says he's feeding his reindeer.  What's he got, like a thousand of them?  What's going on?  All right, cool.  I bet you that they heard that we wanted to get Santa pictures, and they, uh...  Yeah.  Well, I think a chant going is going to have to happen to get Santa back.  I mean, there's no reason that Santa should not be there. 
[02:54:30]  These homeless people need Santa more than anybody.  Santa should absolutely be there.  It's a mall on a Saturday.  How is he on break at 5?  Come on.  Get Danny on the phone.  We got another idea for, uh...  Have Hulk face.  Uh, Club Soda Canning, what's up?  I'm in Starbucks with Marcus the Skateboard, dude.  Santa Claus ain't coming out.  He's hiding until we left.  He's hiding until you guys leave?  Yeah, yeah.  Marcus the Skateboard, dude, made out of light.  He's got new sneakers and a new coat, and the fans chipped in about $40 extra for him, 
[02:55:00]  and he's buying his little Starbucks right now.  All right, he's getting a little Starbucks for himself.  Very good.  And then we'll go to Innovation Luggage to get free stuff next.  Hey, Kenny, uh, breaking news.  They shut down the mall.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, the cops are blocking the exit to the mall, uh, the entrance to the mall.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, you guys definitely left your mark on this mall today.  Well, yeah.  Be cleaning for months.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Kenny.  We're going back to Danny. 
[02:55:30]  Uh, Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Uh, we're on our way to Macy's.  We're going to get half a Hulk face.  A nice makeover there at the makeup counter.  Good boy.  Oh, great.  Can we get that ear pierced?  Oh, God.  Hey, half a Hulk face.  Can we get your ear pierced?  Uh, no.  Uh, no.  He doesn't want to look silly.  Yeah, that would look silly.  That would look ridiculous.  All right, Danny, thank you.  Yeah, and, uh, Papa Rock will not stop complaining, uh, how bad he wants a beer.  So, I think after that, we're going to go try and get him a beer to shut his mouth. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Papa Rock is a drinking problem.  Uh, you think?  He could.  I don't want to speculate, but.  Milf?  Sometimes, if they go to a restaurant, sometimes it's nice to have a, you know, they have a  Mexican restaurant over there.  You have a little, uh, taco and then, uh, Corona.  That's nice.  Let's go to, uh, Milf for you from Whack Bag.  What's up, Milf?  Hey, everybody's cheering, waiting for Santa Claus.  And we're outside the gap.  I think Tippi Tom is in the gap now, shopping.  They're calling him Tippi Tom. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, good.  Isn't that great?  Excellent.  Good.  Oh, hello?  It's like when they change Darren's on, uh, Bewitched.  No one cares.  No one really, it doesn't bother them.  They're just, he's the new Tippi.  It's the new beau.  Right.  That's who it is.  So he's in the gap now, looking for a new outfit.  All right.  Very cool.  Yeah, I think we might have to start a chant where Santa's supposed to be sitting, because  that's not cool.  They're all outside here yelling.  Yeah, Santa's, yeah.  All right.  Maybe we could get one of the guys on the phone that's near Santa.  I want to hear the chant they're doing, all right? 
[02:57:00]  Hang on.  Let me find someone for you.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to Wayne.  Wayne in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Wayne?  Yeah, I was just standing outside Sharper Image about 10 minutes ago.  Yeah.  And this snooty woman kind of pushed her way up to the front of the crowd, and she walked  back to her husband and just said, like, really disgustedly, there's nobody famous in there.  Oh, is that great? 
[02:57:30]  They think it's a celebrity.  Snobs.  They are celebrities.  They are celebrities for a day.  Trust and fear, and people heading for the exit.  Oh, that's great.  Good.  Get out.  Good job, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  You're harmless.  Milf.  Hang on.  I'm trying.  No one's yelling.  They're all in the gap watching Tippi Tom's shop.  All right.  Can you see what he's getting?  I'm looking at a spy camera right now, by the way.  Are you?  Very interesting.  Damn.  Very interesting. 
[02:58:00]  Security's not letting anyone else in the gap.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  They're doing a good job, the security over there.  Yes.  All right.  Call back if you got any info on the chant there.  Okay.  Okay.  Maybe we should take a break.  Yeah.  I think that Santa should be out there taking photos with the homeless people.  We might have to see if Santa is available.  Yeah.  The homeless shopping spree has to end with something with Santa.  We want Santa. 
[02:58:30]  We want Santa.  We want Santa.  We want Santa.  We want Santa.  We want Santa Claus.  We want Mr. Claus.  Come on.  Yeah, let's, uh, oh, here's Fez.  Can't deny.  Fez.  Hi, boys.  Hey.  Fez at the homeless shopping spree.  We are on our way to see the man himself, Santa Claus.  Uh, now we hear that he's on this break that he's been on since two.  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that one.  We hear that he's on a break, and he's been on a break since two o'clock this afternoon, 
[02:59:00]  and he won't come out.  Really?  Yeah, we might have to, uh, get some listeners to maybe entice him to come out a little bit,  if you know what I mean.  Sure.  Well, we'll do what we have to do.  Um, I've tried to find pants for myself.  Yeah.  We've been to Lane Bryant.  Lane Bryant.  Uh, Pee in a Pod, Maternity Store.  And really nothing that's fitting right so far.  Really?  It's a little tight around the, uh, hips? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I, uh, if there was a store called Mom's Jeans, I'd be all set.  Yeah.  Well, good luck to you, Fez, uh, in your search.  I hope you can find good church pants.  Yeah.  And don't forget, uh, Ronnie's, uh, I mean, your cigars.  You know, I mean, I'm, I've teamed up here with Slow Motion and Big Pop.  Big Pop tried on a hat at one place and was forced to buy it after trying it on.  Forced to. 
[03:00:00]  He couldn't take it off.  Those little crab claws were holding tight.  All right.  Thank you, Fezzy.  There's a sign there.  If you, if you infest it, you bought it.  Let's say hi to Keith the Cop.  Keith, what's up?  Gentlemen, I've just ended my negotiations with the union that represents Santa Claus,  and we will have a 515 shooting, uh, with all our homeless people and Santa Claus in  the center of the mall outside Macy's.  All right.  Spread the word.  Ah, there you go.  Keith, spread the word, because when we get back from break, we want to gather at that 
[03:00:30]  point, okay?  So rally up by Santa.  Rally the troops by Santa.  All right, let me go.  I'm going to hit, uh, all these guys on the radio.  I'll talk to you in a minute.  All right.  Oh, yeah, they got radios and everything there.  All right, we got to take it.  We're in the middle of the homeless shopping spree, 2006.  Woo!  What a day.  What a day.  If we could tell somebody, uh, a spy, uh, you know, that, uh, let, let that person know  to get by Santa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  And here are the headlines right now.  They have shut down the mall.  Uh, they're blocking the entrance to the, uh, the, uh, mall at Short Hills. 
[03:01:00]  Couple of, uh, police cars.  They're not allowing nose to nose.  Any more cars into the mall area until we leave.  Shut it down like there's been some kind of a nuclear leak.  That's right.  We have completed hostage negotiations.  Right.  And Santa will be making an appearance even though he's been on break since two o'clock.  They actually had to have police negotiate like he's a jumper.  Hostage negotiations went on today.  You don't want to do this to yourself.  Right.  Right.  Santa, please, please come out. 
[03:01:30]  You don't want to do this.  You've got to come out and, and meet the homeless and take pictures with them.  Santa, your mother is here.  Please come out.  Please, Santa, don't, they'll do horrible things if you don't come out.  Spy cam, spy cam, heading to Santa.  To Santa.  Uh, and what, what, what are some of the other headlines?  Uh, half a Hulk face getting a makeover probably after the break.  Uh, we have to, or at least after his Santa picture.  I think he's got to do Santa and then the makeover. 
[03:02:00]  Cause we, it seems like we had the Santa in about 10 minutes.  We got to do the Santa first.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to my brother, uh, Elmo here.  Elmo.  Elmo.  As the fans feed our egos, we will continue with the homeless shopping spree 2006. 
[03:02:30]  on the, uh, Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks, brother Elmo.  All right.  You're listening to the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  And now it's time for another getting to know the homeless with your host, Steve C.  We're, we're bringing you to a big, beautiful mall.  What are you going to go for first?  Well, I would like a Mercedes Benz. 
[03:03:00]  Um.  Okay.  It is realistic.  Can I, can you work on that one?  No.  No?  Okay.  That one we can't do.  Stay tuned for another installment of getting to know the homeless here on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Go get lost.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to, uh, the homeless shopping spree 2006.  Shaping up, uh, to be a huge success.  Um, I'm looking, uh, well, let's just say I'm looking.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  And the crowd's, uh, just growing.  They're all behaving.  They're just growing and, uh, really proud of the fans. 
[03:04:00]  You know, no joking aside here, they're, they're behaving themselves.  We're a crazy show, but in the end, we really do try to behave and just have a really, really  good time.  So, uh, it's the ONA virus spreading across America really fast.  We got to give some love to break.com.  It's also up on YouTube, but we did another TV commercial for XM, uh, this time around  and break.com.  They've been great to the show lately.  They threw the commercial up on their front page, which is unbelievable because they only 
[03:04:30]  had like two or three videos a day on their front page and they decided to help us out  and they threw the commercial right up there on the front page of break, break.com.  So if you're a faithful listener of the show, could you please do me a favor?  Go there, check out the, uh, the commercial that way.  Yeah.  And then show break.com some love and, you know, check out some other videos.  We're starting to really, really love break.com.  Uh, we're working together here and it's, it's, it's, it's nice.  Thank you.  Thank you to break.com.  Yeah.  And look for it on TV.  On TV starting Monday. 
[03:05:00]  That's what it's there for.  On the television.  The television.  It's actually pictures, uh, sent over, uh, uh, cable or sometimes the air I hear.  And, uh, yeah, you're able to see him on something called the television.  It's nice.  It's like radio with pictures.  Let's say hi to Keith the cop.  He's organizing the homeless.  Keith, what's going on?  All right.  We're currently gathering our last couple of purchases and Santa will be meeting us in  approximately five minutes for our group picture and sing along.  How'd you get it?  How'd you sing along? 
[03:05:30]  How'd you get it?  How'd you get him out?  What's that?  I'm sorry?  How'd you get him out?  Uh, well, we convinced them that we wouldn't leave until seven o'clock if they didn't bring  him out.  I'm telling you, there was hostage negotiations going on with the mall Santa.  There's a helicopter waiting outside to take him to the airport where a 747 is waiting.  He's going to have to leave the way the strippers left in Apocalypse Now.  Yeah.  Throwing down flares with people hanging off.  It was pretty much a back and forth negotiation with the time we would leave if we brought Santa 
[03:06:00]  out.  All right, cool, Keith.  We'll check in in a couple minutes here, all right?  Yeah, as soon as I get them all together, we'll check in.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Katie.  She doesn't get it.  Katie from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I don't get the whole concept.  Well, we got a bunch of homeless people who we come on the show and we get to know them  and then we give them money and the fans give them money and they shop in a nice mall  and they buy stuff that they need.  Something they would never be...  Why do you turn the Short Hills Mall into a breeding ground for white trash?  Because you guys are really snooty in that mall.  No, but you ruin shopping experiences for me. 
[03:06:30]  People like myself who are trying to do Christmas shopping.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm snooty.  What people?  Overprivileged white people?  Too bad.  Deal with it.  No, but you're doing it to help them.  You're not doing it to help them.  If you're doing it to help them, then you would have bought them stuff and not make a  mockery of them.  We do buy them stuff.  Shop somewhere else, you spoiled whore.  We do buy them stuff.  It's for you.  Ah, shut up.  Shut up.  You spoiled whore.  Shut up, Katie.  Shut up.  Why don't you die, get knocked up by a non-white, and shop somewhere else, you overprivileged 
[03:07:00]  whore.  That's exactly right there is why we go to the snooty mall every year.  Deal with it, bitch.  Every year.  Ruining her shopping experience of breeding ground.  Yeah, for white trash.  There you go.  They are listeners, and they are white trash, and I can't argue that.  Of course.  She had one valid point, so what?  There you go.  That's why we do it, though, right there.  Ruining the shopping experience for me.  What do you got, Daddy's Amex?  You're going to buy yourself a little something?  Ha ha.  I love the fact that we're annoying people today. 
[03:07:30]  Absolutely.  Sorry, honey.  That's right.  Let's go to Than.  Than?  Hey, what's up?  We're trying to make our way over to Santa.  All right, yeah.  It seems to be the thing, the words getting around, that it's time to meet where Santa is.  Yeah.  Have you spoken to Sam yet?  No.  Why?  Just he's with me, and I want to make sure I'm not covering the same ground.  Hey, is Santa out yet, then?  Let me run over there.  So far, Gray Wolf has destroyed the bathroom. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, they have a tendency to do that, the homeless.  They really take their toll on the bathrooms.  It's like a carpet bombing.  I mean, they're trying to make up for lost, good bathroom experiences.  They start squeezing their wrists and working their way up the arm like tubes of toothpaste.  Pours out of them like space food.  Hey, I see Santa.  Oh, wait a minute.  I think I see Santa.  One of the spy chams is following Santa.  Santa just raised his arm in the air because everyone else just noticed Santa. 
[03:08:30]  Let's go to the phone.  Do they cheer you?  Yeah, let's hear.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Danny.  Danny.  What's going on?  I'm in here.  I'm in here.  I'm with you.  I'm with the show.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We'll get to him in a second.  I think this will help us out.  Mil, for you, what's up?  Hey, Santa just came by.  They're all waiting for him to, I guess they're all taking pictures of him now in front of a fountain.  So they all just yelled, and the gap threw on everybody out.  So they chanted the gap suck.  Oh, the gap threw everybody out? 
[03:09:00]  Gap threw everybody out.  Santa has arrived.  And Steve is with Santa helping escort him to wherever he's supposed to be.  No, he's not even going to his chair.  He's just in the middle of this chaos taking pictures.  You tell, you make sure, someone's got to make sure Santa gets to his chair because it's got to be a legitimate shot.  No, it's not working.  Keith is backing everybody up, and Santa's just taking pictures in the middle of this chaos taking a picture.  There's no way he's making it to the chair.  All right. 
[03:09:30]  Thank you, Milf.  We're going to go back to Danny.  Danny, what's up?  Guys, we have Santa.  All right.  Everybody is crowded around Santa.  We're going to get a nice group shot.  It's not about him.  Where's the guy at Tipping Tom?  Red just almost took out 10 people.  He's falling over everything.  I see security.  I see Santa.  I see a lot of people on both decks of the mall.  Wow.  A little bit of a longer shot.  That is nice.  Lots of people.  Santa, the homeless. 
[03:10:00]  We got Spite Cam.  We want Cam on Santa.  This is so cool.  Got to love the pal talkers that made it inside the mall with their equipment.  We want individual shots of Santa, too.  We don't want a whole group shot.  Yeah, not a group shot in the middle of the crowd.  I want him sitting in his chair, and I want each homeless to be able to go up and take a picture with Santa.  And tell him what they want for Christmas.  That's right.  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  Let's go to Cameron in Connecticut.  Cameron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, I think this is an awesome idea that you guys are doing. 
[03:10:30]  And the first time I actually got through on the show.  Oh, welcome.  All right.  And that lady that said you guys are turning into a breeding ground for white trash.  Yes.  She's just ignorant and stupid.  And that's why we go to a mall like the mall at Short Hills.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kenny.  He's with Santa.  Kenny.  Yeah, we're taking our picture with Santa Claus.  Oh, I see it.  The spy cam.  Yeah, when they're singing Christmas carols, this place is popped out.  Outstanding room only on both floors, the balcony overlooking. 
[03:11:00]  Everybody yells at Santa when he made his grand entrance.  We're taking the phone now.  I think Big Red's got a problem with Santa.  What happened?  I don't know.  But it's up.  He's homeless.  That's why he's got a problem with him.  Wow, I'm looking at the pal talk camera.  A lot of this stuff will be up on opianthony.com later on this weekend.  Wow.  We've got to thank Innovation Luggage for giving us the free stuff, bro. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, they gave backpacks to all of our homeless.  I'm looking up on the balcony now just seeing people looking over the edge.  This is huge.  Standing room only this year.  The amount of people that showed up for this and the outpouring of generosity.  Yes.  The money that the listeners have given to the homeless.  Wow.  Completely out of character for them.  All right, we've got a guy that works at Short Hills.  Let's say hi to Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up? 
[03:12:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mark.  It's just pretty funny.  All the managers are walking around with walkie-talkies waiting for you guys to come in the stores,  getting prepared just in case something happens.  You know, it's also good.  This thing, they have a plan.  They have things going the way they want it to go.  But I think the longer it goes, the more kind of like, all right, enough of this they're getting.  Like, they don't want it to go this long.  Hey, did you guys have warning before we came?  What's up? 
[03:12:30]  Did you guys know before we came that we were coming?  Yeah.  Actually, one of my managers listens to a radio show all the time.  Okay.  And the store managers are making, like, a lot of people stay in the store, like the managers.  Yeah.  Just in case you guys come in.  I think it's fun.  Keeping the brass in there.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  We're going to go to Sam.  Thank you for that, Mark.  Sam's with his camera.  Sam, what's up?  Hey, man.  Big Blue has this thing under lock.  He had a couple holding his bags for him the entire time. 
[03:13:00]  He had people holding his bags?  Like when the rich and famous go shopping.  He got his picture with Santa.  He got new pants.  He got boots.  He got a belt.  He got a boombox.  He did all right.  I think Blue did really well.  He did.  Yeah.  All right.  Did everyone get their pictures with Santa?  What did you say?  Did everyone get their pictures with Santa?  Yeah.  It was a group shot, but everybody got a shot with him.  A group shot?  Why are they doing the visuals?  I think it was too much pandemonium there.  Oh, yeah.  What I was seeing.  I don't know.  It looked like, from what I could see, they couldn't even get Santa to his chair. 
[03:13:30]  It was just too packed, unfortunately.  He is the slow poke.  We're trying to get under the bus now.  All right.  I think the homeless are heading toward the bus.  Let's say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg, what's up?  It'll take him a while.  Hey, guys.  With their bad, scabby legs.  Hey.  Just want to let you know, I think I have line of the day, actually, too.  There's two black ladies out.  The side of Nordstrom's going, what's this all about?  The other one goes, well, I think it's for the Opium and Antia show. 
[03:14:00]  Opium.  Wonderful.  That's my friend Mandy.  We were waiting for everybody to come in by the main entrance.  She goes, you know, I feel like this is the 4th of July.  I'm waiting for Macy's fireworks to go off.  What about a picture of Have a Hulk Face?  What about Have a Hulk Face's makeover?  I don't know.  Yeah.  We don't have any of the guys on the phone.  Travis is working on the phone.  Yeah, where's Have a Hulk Face?  Let's go to Bob in the meantime.  Bob in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Just want to let you guys know, the Livingston Mall, which is like 3 or 4 miles north, has 
[03:14:30]  got to like an orange alert in case you guys make your way up there, too.  Oh, well, now I see Santa sitting down in his chair.  And little children are being brought over.  Yeah, I see that, too.  To him now.  All right, I want half a Hulk Face over there.  Half a Hulk Face to the Santa chair.  Yeah, let's go.  Half a Hulk Face, Santa chair.  Danny?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, we had some, they escorted Santa away immediately after the group shot.  Yeah, but I'm seeing Santa right now in the Santa chair with children on his lap.  Oh, he came back?  We want half a Hulk Face in that lap. 
[03:15:00]  We need half a Hulk Face to take a picture with Santa in the chair.  In the chair.  I will see what I can do.  It was to my knowledge that Santa was going bye-bye, and we had a...  Get Keith or Kenny with you for that one.  Put it this way.  I'm looking right now, and he is sitting in his chair.  Get Keith or Kenny with you on that one.  What's that?  Get Keith or Kenny with you on that one to get that picture.  Half a Hulk Face in Santa's lap.  Yeah, he gets his picture.  All right, I'm going to see what I can do.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Craig.  Hey, Craig.  Trying to pull a fast one on us. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I guess Craig was at the mall.  Craig?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I was standing upstairs, and we're looking down on a homeless fellow with the guitar.  His name escapes me right now.  And the lady's walking around with the kids.  She said, yeah, I saw this guy in concert back in the 70s.  He's a big rock star.  Trying to get her kids down there to meet him.  I explained to her what was going on, and she was like, no, no, no.  He's a rock star.  He's got to be.  Oh, because she sees people following him around and stuff.  Wearing Ray-Bans.  Crosby stills in garbage. 
[03:16:00]  What a day for the homeless.  What a day for shopping.  Everyone's getting into the spirit of Christmas.  Yes.  Thad, what's up?  We're sort of looking like we're kind of mulling towards the exit.  Blue is charging people by the word for his bad carol singing.  For what?  Apparently, $1 gets you jingle.  And it's a sort of sliding scale after that. 
[03:16:30]  Sliding scale.  He's charging people money to sing carols.  I think he's exploiting people.  I see Santa with two adorable kids on his lap.  Two little kids are on his lap right now.  Yeah.  I want one ugly one.  Yes.  All right, then.  Anything else you got?  No, it looks like we're coming to us right now.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  I don't know.  They said you want to talk to me.  We want to get half of the Santa is in his chair taking photos with kids.  We want a half a Hulk face on Santa's lap or at least they are in that chair photo. 
[03:17:00]  So we want either you or Keith to go back with Danny because you guys are better negotiators than he will be.  He's sitting in his chair right now.  All right.  We were about to get on the bus.  Well, how far?  You want to go back with half a Hulk face?  Yes.  Just half a Hulk face.  Back to the Santa chair because we're watching him right now.  He is sitting there and children are sitting on his lap and he's there.  He didn't go away.  Yeah.  This spy cam is kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Deb is good. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  Let me take care of that right now.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  Let's go to Jake.  He was just at the mall.  I think he just left.  Jake.  What's up?  What's up, Jake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just came from the mall and oh my God.  I heard girls.  They're like saying, oh, I can't believe they're here.  I don't want to be here.  Let's leave right now.  Three little pussy girls and everything.  Good.  Yeah.  I think we annoyed some of the pussy girls today.  I just started laughing in their face.  Good.  That's what they get.  Yeah.  There are some. 
[03:18:00]  Rats beat it.  Real snobs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right on.  Good.  This will show them.  Hey, Iraq, you got.  Now that is that is the best.  Wow.  Look at him run.  Ovi turns around and goes, hey, Iraq, and looks at his post and it's just empty.  Have you ever seen Kirk turn around and go, Spock, where the hell did Spock go?  Iraq, give me a choice of homeless bits we could play. 
[03:18:30]  I don't want to take a break.  I just want to take a couple minutes to kind of regroup here.  Eli in Brooklyn.  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy, you're a comic genius, but you blew the joke.  Oh, no.  Cosby Stills and Trash.  Ah, there it is.  Damn it.  Ah, very funny, Eli.  Cosby Stills and Trash.  Thanks, Eli.  Good one.  Hey, can we play Homeless for the Holidays?  Is that a good one?  All right.  Let's play this.  And we'll return.  We're not taking a break.  Just listen to this.  You've heard them go shopping on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now hear them sing.  K-Smell Records and the Salvation Army present Homeless for the Holidays. 
[03:19:00]  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride on a goddamn step lady.  Spend Christmas with your favorite homeless lunatics.  You'll hear all the classics.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Had a very shiny nose.  Just like yours.  Deck the Hall.  And who could forget Ziggy's haunting rendition of Silent Night? 
[03:19:30]  Silent Night.  Holy Night.  And if you call within the next ten seconds, we'll throw in as an added bonus,  the making of Homeless for the Holidays featuring never-before-heard homeless outtakes.  I'll take your gun and shoot you and I and shoot all these motherfuckers.  Let me off.  Let me off. 
[03:20:00]  Let me off.  I'm tired as s***.  I said I'm tired as s***.  Off-key, out of time, and smells horrible, it's Homeless for the Holidays.  Get yours today.  Call 1-800-HEP-A-TITUS.  I love that.  God, I forgot about that.  One guy, like, is panicking and wanted off the bus.  Yeah.  Let me off.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, by the way.  Let's say hi to Danny.  Danny?  Hey, guys.  We're trying to make a deal with the mall to let him back in.  It's kind of difficult because we're all outside now waiting for the bus, but they won't even let us back in. 
[03:20:30]  So we're trying to hammer something out with the mall, who's been great to us, by the way.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can get back in.  All we need is half a Hulk face with Santa, for the love of God, not a group shot.  They can't tell you not to come in.  So you guys are...  You know what it was?  Where that group shot was with Santa, that wasn't the actual Santa picture-taking spot.  No.  No, we know that.  We got the spy cam on.  We're looking at Santa sitting there with children being brought to his lap.  I mean, Keith's working on it.  Kenny's working on it.  Everybody's trying to get him back inside to get this done. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  But you guys are pretty much outside now?  Yeah, everybody's outside.  The crowd.  The fans are outside.  All of our homeless are outside.  You got a nice crowd to whatever?  I'm tired.  They can't wait to see the homeless off.  Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.  Thank you.  Do you have any good time?  Crowd now sounds tired, too.  All right.  Hold on a second, Danny.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Sam.  He's outside with Blue.  Sam. 
[03:21:30]  Wow.  Sam?  Sam.  Yeah.  What's up, Sam?  We're outside.  Blue, get out of here.  We're waiting in the parking lot for the bus.  We're trying to hold Blue in one spot.  Blue's got a pile of stuff that he's had people walking around with him for.  The look of disgust on half the...  There's about 100 people at this mall who didn't realize this was happening.  Yeah.  And the look that they were giving Blue when he was walking down the hall is just disgust  and confusion. 
[03:22:00]  It's great.  People show their true colors, man.  I love it.  Disgust and confusion.  I love when people show their true colors.  We're at a wonderful time.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Brother Elmo.  Elmo.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey.  It is still pandemonium.  I'm waiting in the bus.  And there's so many goddamn people here.  And you guys are getting ready to get back on the bus?  Yeah, we're getting back on the bus.  The funny thing is a lot of...  So many people were generous, giving money and all that. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Some lady, some upper crust lady, handed me coupons to Subway restaurant for 99 cents of a six-inch  value sub.  I thought that was a little interesting.  Coupons for Subway.  For Subway.  Everyone else is calling, like, $20, $10, signals from the rafters.  Yeah, snob.  All right.  Hold on one second.  I got breaking news.  I think Big Red just fell over.  Fan.  Yeah, that's pretty much what happened.  What happened? 
[03:23:00]  He...  I'm not sure what he's been up to, but he's...  I don't know.  Maybe somebody spun him around a lot.  Oh, he's a little woozy?  It's probably just the excitement, the merriment, all the people.  It kind of goes to some people's head.  They get a little swoony.  A little overwhelmed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He kind of collapsed into two of our health and security fellows, and his hat came off.  And his hat came off.  Did he have a good time?  Oh, this is great. 
[03:23:30]  Everybody's got lots of impractical stuff, man.  Yeah.  Very impractical.  Yeah.  Geniuses.  All of them.  Tad from Myrtle Beach saying it all.  You guys have to have the greatest effing staff in the history of radio.  Yeah.  These guys did an amazing job at the mall.  Stepped up.  Fan, thank you, sir.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Back to Elmo.  Elmo.  All right.  Did Kenny go back in with half a Hulk face? 
[03:24:00]  Did he?  Did Kenny go back inside with half a Hulk face?  Okay.  He can't hear me?  I can barely hear you.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me say hi to Fez.  He's still inside.  Fez, what's up?  Hey, we're just waiting for the bus to come take me home.  Oh, did you have fun, Fez?  There's a bus that's coming, right?  Yeah, don't you worry.  It'll come and take you back home.  I was always the kid that was last at a birthday party. 
[03:24:30]  My mom always was like two hours late picking me up, and I'm feeling the exact same thing  right now.  You won't miss the bus.  It was very scary as a kid to miss the bus from school or stuff, but don't worry.  You won't miss the bus.  Do you have your little name tag on?  Half a Hulk face is getting his picture with Santa.  Oh, hold on.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  Half a Hulk face is getting his picture with Santa as we speak.  Have that guy move out of the way of the camera.  There we go.  It just happened.  There it is.  We've got a spy cam on Santa.  Half a Hulk face got his picture with Santa Claus. 
[03:25:00]  Bravo.  I think that's the grand finale of the homeless shopping spree right there.  That is the picture we wanted.  We accomplished everything we set out to today.  Yes.  Awesome, Danny.  They obliged, huh?  Yeah, they finally agreed to it.  They saw it our way.  Good.  We'll release all of them.  We won't even take them back.  Just threaten them with that.  Say they're homeless.  We don't have to take them anywhere.  Yep.  Just leave them there at the mall.  And now the spy cam is following half a Hulk face out of the mall. 
[03:25:30]  I see club starter Kenny with a huge smile on his face.  Yes.  Mission accomplished.  We'll get Kenny on the line in a second here.  Thank you, Danny.  You got it.  All right.  Let's go to Wack Baguette.  Wack Baguette.  Good morning, guys.  Good afternoon, boys.  I had a great time today.  Your staff was excellent.  The homeless guys were great.  Everybody was tipping in money for them, and it was excellent to see the Yentes absolutely go crazy.  And you know what?  That stupid C from New Jersey who had a problem with those people, she should go back to her  stupid big mansion in Short Hills and eat her Godiva chocolates and die. 
[03:26:00]  Yep.  Ooh.  Angry.  I didn't hear all of it, but it sounded pretty bad.  She should go back to her big mansion and eat Godiva chocolates and die.  Snob.  Very nice.  Yes.  Take care, boys.  Bye.  All right.  Yeah.  It looks like everyone had a great time.  They're making their way to the bus now.  There's Danny.  Abe in Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Abe.  Hey, man.  Great time.  I got there about two hours early waiting for you guys.  The crowd was amazing, huge.  Yeah.  And just to let you know, I had a few conversations with some of the managers of the Short Hills 
[03:26:30]  Mall there.  Yeah.  A lot of them were actually on the opposite end of their opinion.  They were, what I say, they were happy you guys were there.  They said the snobby little shoppers, they deserved it.  Yeah.  A lot of the people that work there have to deal with it.  Thank you, Abe.  They've got to deal with those snobs all day.  In the end, our listeners spent a lot of money at the mall.  Let's go to Club Soda County.  Kenny?  Yeah.  You just had a half a Hulk face sitting on Santa's lap.  We saw it.  Yeah.  We saw it on the spy cam.  Unbelievable job.  Yeah. 
[03:27:00]  And then by popular request, they wanted me to sit on Santa's lap, too.  And he was insulted because I put my leg over his.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't like that.  You are a creep.  You guys heading toward the bus now?  Yeah.  We're heading toward the bus.  This was a huge success and another unbelievable R&A event.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Good job, man.  We definitely want to hear the big send-off.  All right.  No problem.  We'll be ready for that in about two minutes. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Actually, we're going to take a quick break.  So, stall just slightly for us.  All right, Kenny?  All right.  Cool.  No problem.  All right.  The big send-off when we return.  It's the Homeless Shopping Spree 2006 on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  Stand back.  No, you have to get the kids out.  Get the kids out.  Oh!  Here comes security.  It's the Homeless Shopping Spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:28:00]  A little different today.  It's the Homeless Shopping Spree 2006.  Where are we at?  They did their shopping.  They are getting on the bus as we speak.  Yeah, I think the Santa picture.  Yeah, we got the Santa picture with Have a Hulk face, which I just want framed so I can hang it in my house for every Christmas from now on.  What a great ornament. 
[03:28:30]  It actually looks photoshopped right out of the camera.  Looks like you some type of facey stretch program.  Yeah, let's say hi to Keith the Cop.  Keith, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  Keith, by the way, you had the worst phone today.  I totally apologize.  I apologize.  Anyway, we're just waiting for Mansofo to finish up his demonstration that he's doing yesterday.  And we're getting on the bus. 
[03:29:00]  Thank you, Homeless.  Everybody.  Thank you, Homeless.  Thank you, Homeless.  They're thanking the homeless.  Thank you, Homeless.  The fans are great.  The ball is great.  They treated us absolutely outstanding.  And the most successful homeless shopping spree we've had.  How cool is that to hear our listeners going, thank you, Homeless.  Well, for the rest of the year, it's not thank you.  No, it's...  There's a you in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there is, sure.  But once a year, they're treated like rock stars. 
[03:29:30]  That makes you feel better, you know, stepping all over them for the rest of the year.  Keith, what are your thoughts?  I think the most successful one we've had, the fans, spent a ton of money in this ball  today.  Everybody got treated to a lot of extra stuff on top of the money that we gave them.  Right.  And everyone couldn't be happier, including, you know, the staff, the ball staff, the security.  It went off great.  Great.  Thank you, Keith.  Thanks, man.  We're upset, of course, with a horrified ODS that are in the ball. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Let me go around the horn here.  Than, what's up?  All right.  Well, we've got everybody back on the bus.  And I don't know what we're waiting for, but we're just getting everybody squared away.  Yeah.  Everybody's got their goodies.  Are they talking to each other about what they got?  They're very solitary.  I don't know.  They seem to shell shock.  Somebody gave Blue some really, really delicious Gatorade. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, okay.  That's nice.  That replaces electrolytes.  Looks like he's hitting the spot.  Yeah.  That is so annoying.  Good for him.  I love it.  All right.  Let me go to Kenny.  Kenny!  Kenny!  We're pulling up right now.  We're saying the bottom of about 1,000 people.  It was really an incredible event.  You guys should be very proud of yourselves.  Well, you guys, too.  You did a great job out there in the field.  We've got to personally thank the mall security guys and the mall management because they really 
[03:31:00]  did us right.  Good, man.  Excellent.  Thanks, Short Hills Mall.  Yeah.  All right.  We're pulling out right now.  Say goodbye to everybody.  Say goodbye to about 1,000 of our fans that are there for the send-off.  As they see the bus off back to New York, where these people will summarily be dumped  back onto the street, now with valuables on them.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Hi, boys.  Hey, Steve.  Hello, Steve.  How are you?  I'd like a Valium and a quart of vodka. 
[03:31:30]  Did people really gurr at you all day today?  What's that?  Did people gurr at you all day?  Oh, my God.  I couldn't walk in any direction without people just going gurr.  Gurr.  Gurr.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  Fist in their upper middle class faces.  Hey, Steve.  Were they talking to you like the impression of you?  Yes, they were.  How great is that?  Good.  Thank you, Jim.  I really appreciate that.  I love it that he has to walk by and have people going, hello, Steve.  Hi, Steve. 
[03:32:00]  It was everywhere.  I couldn't walk in any direction in any store without someone going up to me and going,  hello, Steve.  How are you?  Why not?  Why not?  Thank you.  It was, you know, this, and I think I need a bath.  Great job today, man.  Yeah, what are some of your other thoughts there, Steve?  My opinion of homeless people has remained the same.  They stink.  I really don't like being any closer to them right now than I did.  Who would?  It was, we actually, at Brookstone, Big Pop bought, actually spent the last of his gift 
[03:32:30]  card buying a young lady an inflatable neck pillow.  He spent 80 bucks buying her an inflatable neck pillow.  Well, dope.  That's nice and sweet and all, but why?  Who, the rock guy?  No, the big, like the, one of the, the keystone, I guess, at the last minute, Big Pop, one  of the big black guys.  Ah.  He just, he, he was being smooth.  He was putting the moves on her.  He was sitting in a massage chair and decided he wanted to buy her a present and spent the 
[03:33:00]  last 80 bucks on his card buying her an inflatable neck pillow.  You know how much alcohol that idiot could have bought?  I know, at 80 bucks.  20 minutes worth.  Why didn't he just buy it for himself?  He sleeps in the street.  Why not?  I have no idea.  How did your neck pillow pop?  Hey, Steve, have you guys pulled away?  How did your liver die?  We're, uh, we're back on the road now.  We're heading back.  All right.  Very good.  Um, I'm seeing a little slide show that's up on one of the, uh, cams of, uh, pictures 
[03:33:30]  that were taken.  Yeah.  This is great.  I'm just watching on Pal Talk.  Um, one of the, uh, cameras has a slide show of pictures that have been taken and just  crowds of people.  Unbelievable amounts of people packed wall to wall.  They go the entire length of the mall and, um, I'm looking at another, uh, live camera  of people still milling around outside after the bus is already gone, sharing experiences,  I'm sure, with each other.  Yeah.  Uh, memories that will last, uh, an hour or two. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, wow.  Something else just happened.  Uh, Dan.  Shooting, I hope.  Dan?  Yes.  Uh, this is, I guess, truly a holiday story.  Gray Wolf, apparently when he gets off the bus in New York, is going to be meeting his son  for the first time in 27 years.  Wow.  Yeah.  Now, how did that get, uh, hooked up?  Uh, do you want to talk to him for a second?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  He won't be able to understand us.  Hey, Gray Wolf.  What's up?  What's up?  I got, I got my son on my phone, right? 
[03:34:30]  And, uh, when he was three years old, I did a bid.  And, uh, I never got to see him for 24 years.  Went to jail.  He's 27 years old now.  And he called me, uh, last Friday.  Today, he wants to meet me right on the show.  He's on his way from Connecticut to come down with his wife and his kids.  I'm a grandfather.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  How do you feel?  I'm emotional.  Yeah.  My son is listening to us right now.  He's on my line.  He's getting a little choked up. 
[03:35:00]  Uh, Gray Wolf, what, I got a question for you.  Yes.  What is the, uh, first thing you're going to do when you see your son for the first time?  I don't know.  Oh, you suck.  You suck.  That ain't even close to being right.  And here I am, an idiot.  I'm sitting here waiting to hear, like, maybe what he'll do. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, just an emotionless cyborg.  Wait, Matt.  Oh.  We have to get ready.  Well, I'm gonna click.  Who cares?  Oh, horrid.  Can we, uh, can we get video of that meeting? 
[03:36:00]  I'm sure.  I would love that.  I'm sure, yeah.  If we make sure, I, I, Sam, make sure Sam has his camera rolling so we have that.  I do, I do want to, uh, ask Gray Wolf, so, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Rich Voss.  Rich.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Oh, he's literally in front of Gray Wolf because he's got a tear coming from his eye, right?  Yeah, he's, he's a bit emotional about his son.  He actually, uh, he sent out a smoke signal and it just got to him. 
[03:36:30]  That's what happened.  His son wanted to see him years ago.  He has his ear to the floor on the bus.  One wagon, four horses.  I know.  Well, here's the thing.  Uh, I just realized how hard it is to be homeless.  These guys, they're all over the place, but everybody was so nice to us, but the gap, the gap is the worst.  There was a bunch of pretentious salesmen.  It was like we got thrown out of the gap by Nathan Lane.  It was horrible. 
[03:37:00]  And the girl, the little sales girl going, this is a mockery of homeless, okay?  You know what?  You're a salesperson at the gap.  Shut your face and work to register.  A mockery?  I wonder if that was the same girl that called us.  I'll bet you that was the same snooty little brat that called us.  How is it a mockery of the homeless to take them, have them get the adulation of thousands of people,  and then have a bunch of people spend money on them, and let them get warm clothes and ridiculous other items for Christmas? 
[03:37:30]  How is that exploiting them?  Yeah, we have fun with them, just like we do when anyone else comes in the studio.  We goof on everybody, each other.  And to goof on a homeless guy, what are you going to talk about?  The way they smell?  It's horrible.  Wait, Rich, the gap threw you out.  How can you exploit them when you're not going to talk to them for another year now?  You know what I mean?  Wait, the gap tossed all you guys out.  That, to me, is a nice way to treat the homeless.  They're not good enough to shop in the gap. 
[03:38:00]  Their money isn't good enough to spend in the gap.  Around the holidays.  Yeah, but all of a sudden they want to start, you know, they're donating all their money for disease cures.  That's all their billboards.  Until the disease walks into their store.  Literally.  What a bunch of snots.  What an elitist, snotty store.  All right, thank you, Rich.  You did a great job, man, for us.  I really appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Let me say hi to Danny.  He's on the bus.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's everything?  All right.  You guys got out of there live, I see.  Yeah, it was unbelievable. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, I can't even believe the amount of people that were buying these guys' stuff.  They really came to the table.  Yeah.  Are you observing some of the gifts?  What did everyone get?  That would be pretty interesting as we wrap up the homeless shopping spree here.  They said what now?  What did they end up buying that we don't know about?  Oh, well, actually, to be honest with you, they spent so much time just dawdling that  they didn't really get so many stores.  Shaq-ass, lazy, homeless idiots.  All they wanted to do was go drinking.  I mean, it really showcases the reason why these guys are homeless. 
[03:39:00]  They can do that every other day of the week.  Why, on one day, when they're able to actually take advantage of other people and get some  things they can use for the winter, do they have to spend it being lazy and drinking booze?  Can't they just take one day off from taking their life off?  This is the only time this winter they'll be able to drink indoors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's why they wanted to have a drink, sit down and enjoy a beer without being punched  and bricked. 
[03:39:30]  Stupid.  Well, at the very least, they have the balance of their cars they could spend elsewhere.  All right, Danny, get a sing-along together.  I'll go back to you.  That's how we're going to end, all right?  Tell them the gift cards work great for jimmying doors open, too, if they want to rob people.  Let's say hi to Brother Elmo.  He did a great job, too.  Elmo, what's up?  Hey, man.  Yeah, we're all on a bus here just kind of talking about what went on, the goods and the  bad.  A lot of bad, but a lot of good.  Yeah, like what?  What's some of the bad?  Some of the bad, you know, some of the people working behind the counters were pretty awful, 
[03:40:00]  but the guys, me and Roland had, everybody was really cool helping us out.  Well, Elmo, why were they awful?  They were rude?  Yeah, you know, it's a mockery of, you know, these homeless people, that kind of stuff.  You know, we heard that a bunch, and we just ignored them and just went to other people  who were more than willing to help out.  Good.  Very good.  Creeps.  It was good.  One guy, Marcus, you look at him, and you could tell why he's a homeless guy.  He's just a psychopath. 
[03:40:30]  But instead of buying stuff, he wanted to go to Starbucks, sit back in a nice cozy chair,  and enjoy a nice latte, and chat with the customers.  So we were like trying to go back there.  Like a real person.  Yeah.  And he was losing his mind trying to get him out.  It's like, dude, you know, you could buy some stuff.  What are you doing?  He wanted to be, again, if we can bring up Shawshank, he wanted to be like the guys on the roof,  drinking the beer that one day.  Yeah.  Just drinking beers like regular guys on the roof.  And then you're back in prison again. 
[03:41:00]  He was like the elephant man when he got his shaving kit.  And he delicately dabbed a little calogne on his stupid neck.  Calogne.  And he tried brushing that rotten head with his little human comb.  Those little wispy cancer hairs over that giant mountain of the head.  He just wanted to go into a Starbucks for one day, a little, a few minutes, and actually  not get kicked out, be able to buy something, and sit there like a real human being.  Like a gentleman.  Right.  A gentleman. 
[03:41:30]  I think he's just a psychopath and has nothing to do with that.  He kept trying on different ones.  One of his feet apparently is larger than the other ones.  So it was just a nightmare.  Like a run over by a bus.  Like gout.  Tire marks on it.  All right, Elmo.  Great job.  Thank you so much.  Good job.  Bye, guys.  All right.  It's a dope.  I'm surprised he didn't go get like scuba gear.  Yeah.  Idiots.  Why would that guy spend $80 on a neck pillow for some chick?  Why?  Buy it for yourself.  It's funny that you guys are trying to figure it out. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Do you know how many meals you could buy with that?  I know.  You're homeless, dope.  You could go to Burger King for a month on that.  Yep.  Let's say hi to Fez.  Fez.  Hi, boys.  Hey.  Gap, may I help you?  Hello.  How did it go, Fezzy?  Do you want to maybe go out and party with these guys for a little longer?  Are you about ready to come home?  Yeah, I think I'm about ready to call it a night.  I did it.  This was a really interesting experience. 
[03:42:30]  I found out that Grey Wolf is my real father.  Yes, he's a father and a grandfather, we have found out.  That's wonderful.  Hey, Fez, is there a party in New York tonight?  Yeah, it's going to be a Calico Jacks.  It's a RonFez.net party, and it's going to be a Calico Jacks in Manhattan, 42nd Street  at 2nd Avenue, starting around 9 o'clock.  Can I go?  Yes, you can.  What time is it going until Fez?  I'll probably go to the place closed down.  Okay.  All right, we'll go check that out tonight.  Thank you, sir.  I have to go take a really long, long hot hour before I'm ready to party. 
[03:43:00]  Fez, did you find any friends, maybe, that you make any friends that you might want to  invite over to Retard Island and, I don't know, maybe hang out, watch movies, something  like that?  You know, I met a lot of nice people today.  I thought it turned ugly.  I thought they were chanting, Rich Maul suck.  And then it turned out it was just Rich Maul suck.  Ah, okay.  All right.  It didn't turn ugly at all.  All right, very good.  All right, we're wrapping up here.  Thank you, Fezzy.  Thank you, buddy. 
[03:43:30]  All right, we'll see you tonight at that party.  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, it's great.  Just got out of the Short Hills Mall.  Great event today.  Oh, thanks.  You guys are great humanitarians.  Awesome.  The tree says nothing on you.  Very cool.  Yeah, another Rich Snooty story.  They were Fezzy and Blue were in Foot Locker.  There was this Snooty guy talking to one of the fine officers who was helping you guys.  Yeah.  He was just like, I'm all for the homeless, but not when I'm shopping. 
[03:44:00]  There you go.  All for them, but not while I'm shopping.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pete in New York.  Pete, what's up?  Great time today, boys.  The wife and I went on the motorcycle from the studios.  We followed the bus all the way to the mall.  We had a great time.  Yeah, it was great weather for this.  It was perfect.  It was absolutely perfect.  It's like the Lord himself was sponsoring this event today.  Let's go to No Filter Paul.  No Filter Paul.  What's going on?  Hey. 
[03:44:30]  The mall's pretty much empty down now.  Very successful home shopping spree.  Very good job.  Yeah, thanks for all the help, man.  Yeah, what was the highlight for you, Paul?  Everybody getting thrown out of the Gap and all the people behind the counter getting all snooty with everyone.  Everyone has said that was the worst store was the Gap by far.  What elitists.  Absolutely.  The more high-class stores were much nicer to everybody.  The Gap, all these young black girls, they just snootied and went, eh, I'm not dealing with these people.  All right, well, I guess they're all too good to deal with homeless people around Christmas.  Over and over again, we're hearing that.  Yeah, the Gap was atrocious to everybody. 
[03:45:00]  Nice, very nice company.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  See you later, guys.  Yeah, we want to say thanks to Sam.  Sam, great job today.  Thank you.  Steve wasn't the only one attacked by impressionists all day.  Apparently, a lot of people wanted me to see their cameras, too.  Oh, my camera.  What were they saying, Sam?  They were saying, look, Sam, here's my camera.  One lady was asking me to do movie reviews, and I figured out she was just trying to get  me to say something with a short A in it. 
[03:45:30]  I love it.  A short A?  Yeah.  Camera.  Camera.  Whatever, yeah.  Camera.  God, we have the greatest fans ever.  Yeah, they don't let anything go.  Ever.  Thank you, Sam.  My pleasure.  Make sure if you're on the bus there, when Gray Wolf's son meets him, you videotape  it with your, what is that thing?  We lost him.  I'm sorry.  Camera.  Can we get to Gray Wolf again, though?  I do want to get to him before we go, at one point.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey. 
[03:46:00]  Man, I'll tell you, I think Big Red made out the best.  You believe he had chicks paying him $20 to kiss him?  I don't believe that.  Yeah, someone else said that was going on today.  How did that start?  I don't know how it started, but there was a line of chicks paying him $20 a kiss.  Unbelievable.  That is weird.  Doesn't make any sense.  I don't get it.  Yeah, we don't get that at all.  Yeah, but everybody, another fabulous time.  I got to thank you guys very much. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, you guys did an unbelievable job, man.  Really.  It was the best one yet.  If it wasn't for you guys, this never would have happened.  Well.  And little Jimmy, too.  Oh, you're such a doll.  Hey, Kenny, what was the highlight for you?  The highlight for me?  Highlight.  I don't know.  Just coming back to see you will be a highlight for me.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Keith the Cop, another great job this year. 
[03:47:00]  Thank you, Keith.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate the accolades.  Yeah, what was the highlight for you?  I think the picture with Santa was definitely a highlight.  I saw some tears from some of the homeless guys and the horror on Santa's face.  But they're probably going to have to de-louse the suit again this year.  What's the mood on the bus right now?  Well, a couple of them are taking their nap.  Like children.  When we get back, we're all going to go out to dinner and dump them back on the street where they belong. 
[03:47:30]  They can look in the window as we eat lobster and steak.  Very good, Keith.  The phones are now lit with everyone back in their cars with their impressions of what they saw today.  Keith, just unbelievable.  Thank you so much.  Always a pleasure.  You never disappoint.  It was just a great homeless shopping spree this year.  Another success, yeah.  Bigger than ever.  And that will work on next year.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  We'll see you guys when you get back. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  Jordan in Jersey.  Jordan?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  No one had a clue what was going on.  Yeah.  Like people would ask, oh, what's going on?  And everyone would just tell them random shit.  We were in front of the Gap, and this guy, this woman asked this guy what was going on.  The guy was like, oh, they're having a real big sale.  And the lady just walked away like, oh.  Yeah, they had no idea.  Thinking there's a couple of thousand people there for a sale.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Let me go to Mark.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up? 
[03:48:30]  Hey.  One of the guys bought my girlfriend a pillow in Brookstone, and it was so sweet.  She's so happy.  It was so insane there.  Oh, the homeless guy had bought the pillow for your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Make sure you're a railer while it's under her head and thinking of him.  All right, sir.  It was great.  You guys rock.  Thank you, sir.  Another person that was at the Gap.  Max in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, I was at the Gap when it all went down.  What happened?  There was a girl behind the counter. 
[03:49:00]  She was talking about how their money was no good here and refused to serve them.  So that's when everything started, you know, getting worse and worse.  That's the only complaint we've gotten.  What a snotty bitch.  Just what an awful, awful store.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Terrible.  All right.  Yeah, we got to wrap up now.  Let's say hi to Danny.  Danny, we got a Christmas carol out of these guys or what?  I don't know.  They're kind of tired, but I'll see what they can do.  All right.  All right, guys, you want to sing one more? 
[03:49:30]  How about Santa Claus is coming to town?  You guys know it?  It's a damn thing.  All right.  You ready?  One, two, three.  You better watch out.  You better not cry.  You better not tell us what you want.  Santa Claus is coming to town.  Oakley Avenue.  I love you, kiddo.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  I hope you had a good time.  You can't say that. 
[03:50:00]  That's red again.  What a pig.  Red is a pig.  I think that's it for these guys.  All right, man.  I guess that does it for the homeless shopping.  Yes, what a success.  The staff did an amazing job.  Great job.  Thanks to everybody.  Yeah, absolutely.  The pictures and the videos will be up on opianthony.com in the coming, I don't know,  hours at this point.  All right.  And check out the fan sites, Whack Bag, for video and pictures of this year's homeless shopping.  A big success. 
[03:50:30]  A big success.  All right.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  In studio, Christopher Titus. 
[03:51:00]  Hello.  If you're a circus freak, call in.  We'll help you through it.  Yeah.  For our counseling sessions that we're having now.  Hey, the 97-year-old guy didn't sing Angelica.  When he was doing that, didn't he?  We gave her the rape hotline and the geriatric rape hotline.  Yeah, right?  I blame Viagra.  Right.  You popped three at one time, my friend.  You're going after anybody.  You get a 97-year-old guy that does Viagra, all of a sudden his junk starts working.  What do you think?  What do you think?  He's going to look at a 97-year-old woman and go, let's get it on. 
[03:51:30]  Exactly.  First of all, there ain't no woman Viagra, so that thing is just like a desert.  Right.  So he figured that this 12, 13-year-old girl will be the one.  Well, he shouldn't have gone all the way to the other end of the spectrum, you know.  Get a nice spring chicken of 55 or something.  A lot of people don't know what they do when they wake up after the Viagra.  They're not sure.  Right.  Maybe all the blood rushed out of his head and he just went wild.  Now, I'll tell you a story.  Before they had Viagra, I'm hanging out with my dad at the Oakland Roadshow and walking around.  He's married to this new woman.  And we're walking around and he's going, he had to shoot a needle into his ****. 
[03:52:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm telling you.  No, hold on, hold on.  We're just cleaning up because they dumped out of that.  I don't know why.  Believe me.  What?  It makes no sense.  We understand.  It makes no sense.  You should be able to say that because it's a medical thing and that's what he had to do.  Put the needle into his.  He did.  My father had to get.  You can't say the P word for the guy's thing.  You could say mule.  We say yam bag.  We say junk.  You got it.  So here's the thing.  My dad's junk is not working as well as it should because he had a couple of heart attacks.  Four.  Actually, they actually.  Your dad had four. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, they actually revoked his organ donor card.  Four.  Yeah.  So he's talking to me.  What's he talking?  He's father-son talking, which is freaked me out.  I'm walking around the Oakland Roadshow and he goes, he's going, yeah, so before the  Viagra thing, I had this needle and he had to shoot it.  And he goes, one day, he goes, I figured, they give me, they say 10 CCs you shoot in.  And I figured, so my dad goes.  Shoot in right into the junk.  Yeah, into the junk.  And he goes, I think 10 CCs is supposed to what I'm doing.  The doctor says, don't use any more 10 CCs.  Well, I'm thinking, you know, I want to perform for the new lady.  Can I slow you down a little bit?  Yeah.  Because I don't get it.  So what?  So before Viagra. 
[03:53:00]  But what do you, oh, before Viagra there was something you could.  Yes, my dad got married to this woman, right?  Right.  And he wanted to make sure she was.  But what does this stuff do?  It does what Viagra does.  Yeah, yeah.  No, actually, I think it took the, it probably takes the place of the blood that would normally  go there to put it in the state.  No, it was a chemical.  It was something because it, whatever, it constricted everything so it would.  Oh, my God.  Really?  So his junk would expand.  Hey, is that good?  I did the junk.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  All right, go ahead.  I'm just getting a needle.  So walking around the road to the show, my dad's talking to me.  He goes, yeah, just like tossing it off. 
[03:53:30]  He goes, so I'm going to use it, right?  And he goes, I figure 10 cc's.  They said, you know, 10 cc's is my normal.  I'll do 30 cc's.  So my dad's junk turned, he goes, my junk turned black.  And he goes, and it took 11 hours.  11 hours to go down.  And I'm literally like just bowed over laughing.  That's funny.  I couldn't imagine having to put a needle.  No.  No, you got to be horny. 
[03:54:00]  I'm getting that feeling.  Don't you get that feeling down there when somebody even talks about it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't imagine any woman looking across from him going, you know, you are so sexy.  Give me my syringe.  Yeah, yeah.  See how important it is?  Let's do it.  What?  See how important sex is to guys?  If you're willing to take a needle and jam it into your junk, it's a pretty important thing.  Exactly.  Let's put a perspective for all the ladies out there.  Hey, what happened to Happy Face?  He was calling back after the commercials and no Happy Face.  Dice down at Ground Zero?  We're a little distracted, Christopher Titus, because Dice called all emotional. 
[03:54:30]  He wasn't ready to, he wasn't in the right state of mind to be on our show and we wanted  to go to Ground Zero.  Then we found out he was going down to Ground Zero.  We want to see how that went for him.  I'm just imagining the guys that are down there now working are probably like, all right,  you know, De Niro was here a few months ago and we just really want to pave this road  and get this done.  Exactly.  You know, enough with the visits.  We want to go back home to our family.  Yeah, we're doing our job and, you know, enough with the visits.  Yeah, well, it just becomes a little more about the personality that's going down there 
[03:55:00]  than it does about Ground Zero.  Yeah, huh?  I got my superhero jacket on with the studs.  If you want to go down and not tell the press you're going, I kind of buy that you want  to see it, but if you're going, hey, tell everybody no, you're going down to Ground Zero,  it's not as...  I think he's paying his respects, but it's a little weird.  You think you got a tear up when he's looking around?  Of course you did.  I'm getting a little choked up over here.  I have no problem admitting it.  I went down there.  I bawled.  It's just amazing. 
[03:55:30]  Well, we went to LA.  Here's what pissed me off about it is that people in LA were like, I'm not going to work.  Really?  You're in LA and you're not going to work?  Yeah.  Look at the people there that, where it happened, are busting their ass.  Yeah.  You know, don't let these people...  Why isn't LA going to work?  Huh?  Why wouldn't LA, someone in LA go to work?  It happened.  Like, I called the crew.  I talked to my partners and they said, what do you want to do?  I said, well, I think these guys are putting out fires and saving lives.  We should probably keep going.  Don't let these terrorists win and all.  You know, and what the hell's going on with terrorists?  You know, any country that doesn't listen to their women is going down.  Because you know, Dan, where there was some chick that was serving them food while they 
[03:56:00]  were planning that thing, and she goes, pardon me, what did you say?  You're going to what?  No, don't yell at me, okay?  When your ass got lost in the desert last year, who got you to the Jalalabad?  That was me, my friend.  Okay, I'll say that before you hit me with a stick, but I want you to know I only made  you cold sandwiches because you won't let me learn to read a freaking recipe book.  See, that's another problem they got.  There's a whole sex angle, right?  They cover their women up, they put them in their robes, and they don't get to look 
[03:56:30]  at attractive women.  No, they don't get to look at attractive women.  I think that loosens you up a little bit.  I think so.  You know what?  If you're getting your junk waxed, is that okay?  Very good.  Then you're pretty much doing what I can't do.  You guys are the toughest, edgiest radio station in the country.  You just junk waxed.  I know.  That's silly.  I know.  Hey, Dice is on the phone.  We used to say it.  Dice is on the phone.  This isn't Dice.  Oh, Dice?  Dice?  Well, actually, it's happy face in there.  Hang on, hang on.  See, happy face has to call for Dice.  Happy face calls for Dice.  Okay, now he's getting the legend. 
[03:57:00]  What a crappy phone.  This gets so freaking old after a while.  Who's happy face?  Dice.  Happy face is the guy that makes the call for the legend, and then he gets us on the  phone, and then he hands the phone over to the legend.  It's like a secretary, huh?  I was on Dice's show, by the way.  Dice's show.  Remember the show he did where he was a radio executive?  I mean, a record company executive?  Oh.  I'm ready to present you with the legend.  All right, I'm ready.  Present.  Present.  Okay, here he is.  Are you ready?  Okay, here we go.  Hello?  Hold on.  He was so close to hanging up. 
[03:57:30]  Yes, Andrew.  Yeah?  What are you doing?  Do you understand I'm here with the Salvation Army?  Yeah?  Who's been here since day one at Ground Zero taking care of things.  Right.  And you're bothering me with this nonsense?  Yeah, Dice, we realize that.  We've been here since September 11th.  I understand there's nowhere in New York you could go without getting a ticket now.  What's that?  I'm with the police sergeant, and he told me so.  Oh, sure.  What day is this?  October 1st?  I got the complete police department looking for you. 
[03:58:00]  It's September 30th or something.  All of a sudden, Dice is down there.  Dice.  Yeah.  You could have visited a lot sooner than this.  The entire police department is looking for you guys.  Right.  Right as we speak.  What is he talking about?  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  You're losing us.  Whatever you park.  What are you doing?  You're ticketing.  Whatever you walk, you get ticketed.  What are you doing down there?  Do you understand how it works?  I'm going to put on special police operations lieutenant wind flow. 
[03:58:30]  See how he goes.  He just keeps going.  You hear what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Dice.  Dice.  You hear me?  Everyone knows we're pretty tight with the NYPD.  Yeah, I don't think Andrew Dice Clay is going to change our relationship with the NYPD.  I think it's already been changed, my friend.  I got it under control.  I got a hat.  Dice.  Give me a hat.  Do you understand?  Dice.  Yeah.  What are you doing down there?  I want to put the lieutenant on. 
[03:59:00]  Why don't you let the guys work?  Yeah, I want him to talk to you.  No, don't put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you just let the guys do their job?  What are you doing down there?  Because he says you're getting a ticket now.  What are you doing down at Ground Zero?  What am I doing down there?  Why don't you let the guys do their job?  I'm a lieutenant.  That's who I'm with.  I got the hat now.  I got the hat.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't have the hat.  Let the guys do their job.  They've seen enough disaster down there.  I'm with the Salvation Army.  Right.  I'm with the lieutenant.  And I got the hat. 
[03:59:30]  Okay.  I think you're the last celebrity to get an NYPD hat, by the way.  Holy S.  You have to see another celebrity with an NYPD hat.  You have the FDNY hat, too?  Dice.  You have the FDNY hat?  I have to see another Asian guy that's obviously not on the job with an NYPD hat.  I'm going to kill myself.  Did they give you a patch with the towers and never forget?  I got to talk to somebody right now.  I'm going to put happy on for a second.  No, don't put happy.  It's on for me.  Dice.  It's on for me. 
[04:00:00]  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  What happened?  He's having a nervous breakdown, I think.  Happy face.  Yeah, this is happy face.  Where is the legend?  The legend is taking care of meeting and greeting people.  Meeting and greeting people.  Do you understand that he's a legend and everybody wants to shake his hand?  Absolutely.  There must be at least nine people there.  Absolutely.  There are literally hundreds of people here right now taking pictures of his chiseled chin,  admiring his dimples, and just wanting to touch his body. 
[04:00:30]  Because he is a legend.  Do you understand that?  Do I need to go look at Christopher's face?  And he has sold out Madison Square Garden.  Titus is looking like Jesus Christ.  Did he sell it?  Right.  He played every major area in the country.  Did he sell Madison Square Garden this year?  He's the Olive Garden.  He has paper new special.  Who is this year?  It's the Garden.  Did he sell it at Madison Square Garden?  This is why he's a legend.  On top of all that.  Christopher, stay human, okay?  See, this is your future if you start to happy face.  Start believing your own fate.  Oh, happy face hung up.  He got a little upset.  All right, Rick, call back happy face. 
[04:01:00]  We need Dice to talk because now Barry Williams is on the other line.  Barry Williams?  Yeah.  Yes.  Danny Bonaduce.  No, no, it's Greg Brady.  I know.  He's the guy who's Danny Bonaduce.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got to talk to that.  Wasn't that great?  That was great.  Hey, Greg Brady.  Barry.  The legend there?  No.  No, the legend is meeting people now.  He's meeting and greeting.  He's meeting and greeting in the middle of Ground Zero.  We're very close to getting both of you on the phone at the same time.  I have a spectacular offer for him.  Yeah, so you could ask Dice if he wants to be part of the next celebrity boxing thing. 
[04:01:30]  He's got to get in the ring.  Barry wants Dice to fight a chick.  Well, not just a chick.  Who, who, who, who?  China.  China.  Oh.  From the WWF.  All right, hold on.  We might have Dice back on the line here.  She goes for the junk, though.  Oh, yeah.  She does that punch.  Dice.  Dice.  No, this is Happy Face.  It's not Dice.  Happy, put on Dice, please.  I can't.  He's a legend.  He's taking care of things.  You understand that people want to meet him?  No.  No, see, obviously, you guys, you see, you see, this is the problem. 
[04:02:00]  I got, you know, I just can't.  I can't.  I got to go.  Happy Face.  Happy Face.  He's hanging up now.  He's hanging up now.  Nope.  Dice is hanging up.  All I can say, I mean, I can't be sure, but he's got to know I'm on the line.  He's got to know if this offer's coming.  Rick, one more.  Maybe he's ducking it.  Yeah, one more time, Rick.  That's it.  That's what he's using.  Tell Happy Face that Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady, wants to make Dice an offer.  We're trying to help Dice out.  Come on.  Yeah, like they helped Vanilla Ice out, the last celebrity box.  Right.  Like they helped.  The last celebrity. 
[04:02:30]  Who knew that Vanilla Ice couldn't fight?  What are you talking about, Willis?  Do you see him bouncing around like a jubber?  He thought he was in the prison shower again.  What was that?  He was fighting for his manhood.  Barry, did you watch it?  I mean, I tuned in late.  I didn't get to see you and Danny, but Danny...  Barry was too busy at the hospital trying to wake up.  But that ain't fair, though, because Bonaduce is just training like every day.  I did like the other half like two weeks before the...  But Barry's a friend of ours.  Yeah, he's a martial artist, too.  We can have some fun with him.  He's a martial artist.  I mean, I'm...  I wouldn't go in the ring with...  Bonaduce?  No way!  All that anger from his career, and then on top of knowing martial arts... 
[04:03:00]  You know what else he did?  He stopped taking his mood-elevating drugs about three weeks before.  Oh, he did.  He was totally zoned.  He pulled a Tyson.  Because we were talking to a buddy of mine as a martial arts instructor and trained me,  and man, I got to tell you, man, I don't know if I'd have stepped in the ring with him.  Yeah.  You had a lot of guts, man.  A lot of guts.  Who knew Greg Brady?  Johnny Bravo could do it.  Johnny Bravo.  Do you hate being called Greg Brady, man?  Does it just bug you?  No, I prefer Keith Partridge.  We have Christopher Titus in the studio, Barry.  Yeah, I know.  I have a fan.  Yeah, I wasn't sure. 
[04:03:30]  Me too, man.  Thank God.  I mean, you know, I grew up on you.  Barry has fully accepted the fact that he will...  I've embodied it.  Yeah.  And he's actually done a great job having fun with it.  He put out an album with Johnny Bravo.  Yep.  A Johnny Bravo album, which we played...  It's part of what I'm touring with right now.  Yeah.  Excellent.  Now, Barry, do you put the jacket on, the little vest?  I do when I do Johnny's back and the shades.  Johnny's back.  Ready to rock your town tonight.  Yeah.  I can't get the picture of Dice out of my mind. 
[04:04:00]  With the big NYPD hat on.  The last guy.  Actually, he's the second to last because I believe Caratop is going to make his way down to ground zero  to complete the entire celebrity gamut.  All right.  At least Emo Phillips went early.  Dice.  Who do you want?  What happened?  We want Andrew Dice Clay, please.  You want the American legend.  We need him to speak with Barry Williams, who is on the phone with us right now.  Happy Pace, we'd like to speak to the funniest comic of all time, the American legend, Andrew Dice Clay. 
[04:04:30]  All right.  You see, other people know he's a legend.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We're not denying it, man.  Let's all calm down.  We're trying to do a radio show here, and we've got to move on.  The legend of Pips.  Let's get...  Okay.  Well, hang on.  The legend just may be ready now.  Hang on.  All right.  Okay.  Here he is.  Oh, thank God.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Opie.  Dice.  Opie.  Do you understand?  I'm on with Tom Kennedy.  We're talking about hats.  We're saying I'm over here.  This is how friendly we are.  He's over somewhere, and I'm over here. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, my God.  And we talk like that to each other.  Can just please...  And he's going, I don't see...  Please, can I pray, please, can one more piece of debris just fall?  Something that was precariously perched on the top of one of the buildings that...  Please, one more piece of debris.  One brick.  That's all we need.  Very well-  I don't see ONA walking around with the hat.  Hey, Dice.  Dice.  I went down to ground zero three weeks after the event by myself in the middle.  All the night.  No one knew I was there.  Says to me, we give you the hat. 
[04:05:30]  Not ONA.  See how he's going with the hat.  All right, Dice.  We have great...  Tom Kennedy gave me the hat with the lieutenant.  I understand.  Dice, we have the real Greg Brady on the line.  Right.  Barry Williams from...  You remember Barry?  Yeah, I love Barry.  He's very nice.  With a proposition for you and your fine career.  But the thing is, he don't got the hat either.  Right.  I love the hat!  What?!  You know, the hat bitch is a little old.  I'm the one down there with Tom Kennedy and the lieutenant. 
[04:06:00]  All right.  We understand.  Dice.  Dice.  Here's Barry Williams, Dice.  Let me talk to you for just a second.  That's not the closer.  I'm talking about something.  Listen, it's a very patriotic thing that you're doing down there.  Now, when you think about what went on, it gets you mad, doesn't it?  Who am I talking to?  Barry Williams, you dick!  Well, television set.  I'm not in show business right now.  Right now, I am down.  Stop listening.  At Ground Zero with the lieutenant. 
[04:06:30]  In the hat.  I know.  In the hat.  In the hat.  In the hat.  Please.  The whole Kennedy clan is it.  Carlos Scherzke.  Well, whatever.  Look.  Look, I know a lot of people that work down at the site at Ground Zero.  I know a lot of them listen to the show.  Could you please, one of the crane operators, could you just lower something heavy on Dice?  Please, please, right now.  He's standing right there.  Lower one of those big toolbox things.  Or one of those big wrecking balls.  Just drop it on Dice.  Please drop it on Dice.  Or pick him up and dump him in the river. 
[04:07:00]  Could you just dump him?  Move the boom on over.  Dump him in the Hudson.  Could you please just dump him in the river?  Just lift him up in the air a few hundred feet.  Please.  Make it look like an accident.  Barry.  Barry.  Barry.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Barry Williams.  Please speak with Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice, I just want to say that I think it's great what you're doing down there, but it  has to get you mad when you think about what happened.  It doesn't get you mad when you think about what happened.  And I call you with an offer. 
[04:07:30]  Gets us mad that the Port Authority Police Department doesn't get enough answers.  Oh, who is this now?  Much work we've been doing down here.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Where is Dice?  Get Dice.  Dice is standing by with us, shoulder to shoulder with the Port Authority Police Department, sir.  Why do you have to be on the phone to try to get more credit?  We all know the Port Authority, you know, lost.  Oh, I hate this crap.  Get Dice on the phone.  All right.  All right.  Calm down, man.  Dude, let it go for a second.  If you get this putz off and put somebody on who's reputable, okay, then I'll put Dice 
[04:08:00]  on.  Get Dice on the phone.  Put Dice on the phone.  I'll explain it in a minute.  I'm so sick of people that are pissed off because they're not getting enough credit.  Well, that's...  With this whole Ground Zero thing and the terrorist attacks.  I know.  That's not credit, sir.  It's simply a matter of getting the information out.  I'm going to put Dice on and then I'm sending 20 cops down to lock your ass up.  Put Dice on.  I don't understand why you have to call to try to get credit for a job that you're doing. 
[04:08:30]  Obviously, I should be the one that's the mayor at this point.  I agree.  Make a visit down here.  I'm coming down with...  Make him the mayor and then please, can we have the first mayor of New York assassinated?  Please.  I'm coming down with 25...  This is making me yearning for my family.  Dice.  And you're going to get frisked and sentenced.  Dice.  What do you think?  I'm a moron.  Barry, Barry.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of trying to get him in the spirit of it, I think you're going to have to go directly  to the offer.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice. 
[04:09:00]  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  I am there with the Kennedys and the...  Oh, my God.  Dice, I have a...  Barry Williams has an offer for television for you.  Money.  I am there with Lieutenant M. Winslow.  Do you understand?  To help your fame, there will be money.  Lieutenant M. Winslow.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  He's my superior.  He is my answer to it.  Dice.  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Christopher Titus here.  Dice.  Who's there?  Christopher Titus.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  You ain't no cop.  I am a police general officer. 
[04:09:30]  I get it, man.  Look, Barry Williams has an offer.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  He is definitely having a nervous breakdown.  We are listening to Dice in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  Let's all just sit back and listen.  Perhaps seeing Ground Zero was the last straw.  Snap them like a twig.  I have work to do in the city.  I drive around in a Lincoln old school.  Dice, you're having a nervous breakdown.  Seek help.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  I will arrest you and put you in jail, and I will have Lieutenant Winslow send you with 
[04:10:00]  the Judge Kennedy.  You understand what I can have done now?  Dice, you're a madman.  The name is Bloomberg.  We is bad back Bloomberg.  I want to talk to the mayor.  You know what I mean?  I'm seeing sodas down here.  I'm seeing open bottles of water.  I want to see good stuff.  I highly recommend you see Dice at the Beacon Theater tonight, because I truly believe  it will be the last time he'll be on a stage.  We're not entertaining the boys anymore.  Dice, Dice, I think hawking for the workers down there is pretty much done with. 
[04:10:30]  You know, they're getting everything they need.  Maybe if you were there in October, maybe if you were in New York during the event, and  in the months following it, you would understand what was going on, instead of being the self-centered  guy that you are.  Dice, I am running this city now.  I will bring this city back to the greatness that we once were. 
[04:11:00]  Hey, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  Why didn't you just wait until the buildings were built back up?  Why didn't you wait until they just built the buildings again?  And then show up.  I am so glad.  Lieutenant Bloomberg and Captain Lieutenant Winslow.  Hey, Dice, why don't you go to Pearl Harbor?  I hear something horrible happened there a while ago.  Help those people.  You live in your own little world.  Jesus, Dice, go to Cape Canaveral.  I hear one of the shuttles exploded.  Go down there. 
[04:11:30]  Pay your respects.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ.  What is he talking about?  I'm here.  As long as you abide by the rules of my people who work on the main, the police people.  Dice, Dice, go to the harbor.  The Titanic was supposed to come in, but it sank.  Pay your respects.  Hey, these people need warm clothes.  The survivors of the Titanic, they need warm clothes.  Help them out here. 
[04:12:00]  I'm here with the people from White Star Lines.  The White Star Lines people had a hard time.  The ship sank.  And these people to survive is a cold.  They need blankets.  Send them down there.  I'm going to Jersey.  I'm going to Lakehurst, New Jersey.  I hear a blimp exploding.  The people are hurt.  They need help and support.  The Hindenburg.  Oh, the humanity.  I can't look.  Holy Jesus.  My God.  It's unbelievable. 
[04:12:30]  That was...  Barry?  Yeah.  We were close that time.  We should mention...  We were close.  We were pretty close.  This might not be the most opportune moment.  I'm not sure.  He has lost his mind.  He's having...  Oh, there he's cow burnt down Chicago.  Please, people need homes.  These people need homes.  By the way, I...  Ty Ford Mary's killing everyone.  By the way, I don't want anyone to confuse what I was saying.  But it really pisses off Ant and I when people feel like they have to call the media,  you know, radio stations, TV, to try to get more credit. 
[04:13:00]  We understand the tragedy.  Believe me.  But to...  Believe me.  And this isn't the first or second time this has happened.  You know?  Yeah.  So, if you were for the Port Authority, it wasn't a stab at you.  But I can't believe the guy's, you know, calling and trying to get more credit for the  Port Authority.  The Midwest is in a dust bowl.  They're in a dust bowl.  They need our help.  It's a big drought.  Hey, Dice, I hear there's a hurricane coming off of Florida.  Yeah, it's Hurricane Andrew.  Please hurry.  Help.  Gah! 
[04:13:30]  I don't think anybody doubts your respect for the Port Authority.  Crack a tower.  It's erupting.  The people of Pompeii.  They're all stuck in Iraq over here.  Oh, my God.  They need your help.  At least you made it funny.  I got the hat.  I got the Mount St. Helens hat.  Run for your lives, people.  Run for your lives.  Mount St. Helens erupted.  Run for your little look.  I got the Washington State Police hat. 
[04:14:00]  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  Mount St. Helens.  Run, people.  Look at the ash.  I'm the biggest ash here.  I'm an ash hole.  Well, you know, he's a fellow comic, people, so I'm just going to sit here quiet.  Of course.  No, as a fellow comic, everyone could go find dice.  But he's on it.  I've never heard him that out of his mind.  He is completely, he's lost his mind somewhere.  Yeah.  Christopher.  Has it been going on for a while?  Yeah, yeah.  Ever since we've been doing this program. 
[04:14:30]  Wow.  He's lost his mind somewhere.  Remember he come up on stage, you know, hickory-dickory-dog.  You know, he do his things and his cigarette smoke.  That's right.  I'm on the line with this chick at the bank.  And she's got a tongue.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now, he does what you just heard.  He babbles, incoherent.  That's his show?  You don't even know what he's talking about.  Yes!  Oh, you guys aren't actually helping the ticket sales at the Beacon Theater.  No, no, absolutely.  The place will be packed tonight because it could be his last show ever.  Because you will see a man having a nervous breakdown tonight. 
[04:15:00]  You will see a man having a nervous breakdown at the Beacon tonight.  I know MTV wants to take advantage of that whole Ozzy Osbourne show.  Kennedy's been shot!  Kennedy's been shot!  MTV should follow dice around with cameras.  There's your next hit, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See the real dice when he's not on the stage.  It's kind of sad.  Greg Brady.  I think the first episode should be down to Ground Zero with him.  Oh, man.  That seems to be a touchstone for him.  Barry. 
[04:15:30]  I think that's his next album.  Ground Zero with dice.  I think that's the next album.  All I could do is apologize, Barry.  I actually thought, silly me, please hit me with a goddamn ball-peen hammer in the head.  I thought he would shut up for enough time where you could actually get a word in edgewise.  At least to spill out the offer.  Yeah.  And we all, we definitely don't want to ever forget what happened.  Right.  But I felt like it was like October 1st.  A little self-serving.  For the last half hour.  Yeah.  I've been sitting over here thinking maybe Christopher would like to put on the gloves.  Man, you know what? 
[04:16:00]  I still have a show.  It's not a has-been, Barry.  I still have a show on television, right?  Maybe after.  Low blow, man.  Ten years.  No, no, no.  Ten years from now.  Let's talk.  My career is on fire again now.  It is, man.  You handled it well, dude.  He was, he's like a fighter.  Yeah, Barry.  You did a good job, man.  That's not a low blow.  More people call me Barry now than ever in my life.  That's true, right?  That's a few, Ant.  That's not a low blow.  I wish I had half the career you had, my friend.  Yeah.  And half the gash.  That's right.  My God, he got some Marsha Brady. 
[04:16:30]  All right, Tom.  Yeah.  Barry, do we hang up on you?  And if we get Dice back, do we try to call you?  Poor Barry, like he doesn't have something to do.  I'll be listening with faded breath.  All right.  All right.  Go get a hat.  The offer's still there.  Christopher, we should talk.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right, man.  Thank you, Barry.  See you, guys.  All right.  It's like the hat got one laugh, and then he just couldn't go.  And then he, that's what he does.  Oh, my God.  The hat got a laugh, and it's like to stay up.  He wants to annoy you.  You should see him.  You should see him.  If you go to the beacon tonight, he will go up to some guy and go, look what color pants you're 
[04:17:00]  wearing, beige, and then he'll go off for 20 minutes on the guy's beige pants.  Because beige is.  You want to run up onto the stage and punch him in the face.  Wow.  Punch me.  By the way, this is the guy who's like on your team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that sad?  I'm glad I'm not.  I'll be calling you like three years crazy from L.A.  Insane.  Just ranting.  Insane.  Dice having a nervous breakdown.  And this just in, Dice is jumping on a plane.  He's going to go to Oklahoma City. 
[04:17:30]  I hear they got a problem with a building.  It blew up.  There was people.  Oh, save the children.  Save the children.  I'm asking everyone, send diapers for the children.  And then he's heading over to Columbine.  Oh, my God.  There's a problem there.  We got to save the kids.  I got a hat.  Hat makes everything okay, I think.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  Charles Lindbergh needs help finding a baby. 
[04:18:00]  There's a ladder out his window.  Someone stole his baby.  He's an American hero.  I got a Lindbergh hat.  I got a Lindbergh.  Oh, man.  Well, love.  The red coats are coming.  The red coats are coming.  Oh, two if I land, one if I sea, three if I head.  God damn, Dice, man.  Nothing funny than him losing his frigging mind.  Engines are coming. 
[04:18:30]  Custer, look out.  Watch your scalp, Custer.  You daffy bastard.  You put your hat on.  Put your hat on so they can't scalp you.  Hey, it's Dice here.  No, it's not.  Don't worry.  It's no Trojan horse or nothing.  Yeah.  Dice here, open the door.  Open the door.  I got a hat.  It's the Trojan hat.  Well, I hear Rock Hudson is sick, huh? 
[04:19:00]  What is it, a flu?  He's got the flu bug.  Oh, wow.  I love watching him have a nervous breakdown.  It's perfect.  Hey, Kennedy, talk.  Kennedy, look out.  Yeah.  I think, wow.  Hey, Adam, don't.  That was really fun.  It's a lot of fun.  You got it when you're hearing somebody actually having a nervous breakdown.  And to wrap it up, go right to the beginning. 
[04:19:30]  Hey, Adam, don't eat that apple.  Adam, what are you doing?  Eve's going to bite it and we'll have eternal damnation or something.  There's a snake.  He's the snake.  Don't listen to the snake.  Snake, cut the snake.  I'll make the skin into a hat.  Eve, what a hooah.  Yes.  She's a hooah.  She's going to ruin it for everybody.  Hey, Noah, build the ark.  It's raining.  It's going to be drowning here, people.  Put on a rain hat.  All right, man.  That was probably one of the best improv radio bits I've seen. 
[04:20:00]  Thank you.  I've done a lot of radio, man, and that was really funny.  And it's sad that I wasn't involved in it.  Moving on.  Whatever.  Well, what happened?  Is he on medication?  He should be.  What happened?  The guy should be.  Guys, I'm not kidding.  I'm like, he's a fellow comic, so I'm like, dude, what happened?  I'm so glad you know this.  I need some Paxil.  Maybe some Thorazine.  I think he's convinced it's funny or something.  We don't know.  We don't know what he does.  We don't understand what he's going for. 
[04:20:30]  And, Christopher, we've talked about this.  Repeating the same joke over and over is not funny.  It's vaudeville.  Right.  Vaudiaville.  We've talked about this.  It's vaudeville in the past.  I'm not kidding.  I'm in New York.  I don't mean to rip dice, but, I mean, it's like.  Right.  We've talked about this, though.  Me and Obi sit there and go, why does he call up and just go on and on and not stop  no matter what you say?  You go, okay, guys, we got it.  But let's talk about this.  He keeps going.  You want to reach into the phone and pull his head out and punch him.  And someone has a big bang joke.  I couldn't like to do it. 
[04:21:00]  That's great.  What are you doing?  Big bang.  Big bang.  And they made the universe.  It's in constant motion.  It ain't ending.  You know, because you could say, if it's never ending, what's at the end of it?  Let's say there's a hat.  What's beyond the hat?  Another hat.  Oh!  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[04:21:30]  Oh, man.  He's like freaking the Nostradamus of comedians.  He's doing comedy in Quatrain.  Isn't he amazing?  But it's the same Quatrain over and over.  All right.  We're hanging with Christopher Titus.  Man.  Very funny, guys.  This has been the oddest.  I've never.  It's just been an odd show.  You guys should probably have.  There's a girl that's been molested by this 97-year-old guy.  And then Dice flips out on the phone.  Dice having a nervous break.  You know.  But yeah, trust me.  The show's funny.  Maybe you didn't hear it today.  But I promise.  You know what?  Ask.  He saw it.  He saw it.  Very funny. 
[04:22:00]  We might have to replay what we did to Linda Lovelace's older sister.  Oh, jeez.  Please.  We forgot that happened today.  Right.  Christopher Titus coming in.  More tragedy.  More tragedy and painful yelling.  Come on.  Every time.  No, not at all.  You're having fun, right?  Oh, yes.  All right.  That's all that matters.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  And in studio, Christopher Titus.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  But Christopher, I've got to go back to the phone because Andrew Dice, Clay calling back.  Oh, God. 
[04:22:30]  Not again.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, Dice?  I'm very busy.  Baby Jessica's caught in the well.  And I've got to help her get out.  People, we need to spread the word.  Those workers need sodas and water and hats.  Baby Jessica.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's that?  Dice.  Baby Jessica is now 32 years old.  Well, then she better get out of there because it's probably getting very tight for her.  You're a little late on that one.  Oh, wait. 
[04:23:00]  Just like going down to ground zero.  Oh, my God.  Tragedy.  Yeah.  I've got to head over to the Dakota.  Dakota because I hear one of the Beatles got shot.  Oh, it's a tragic day for everybody.  I've got to get over there.  Oh, but now I'm going from over here to over here now.  Dice, you'll be.  I'm over here in Bethlehem.  You'll be the only one outside the Dakota.  That happened a long time ago.  Yeah.  I mean, there'll be tourists out there because they're there every effing day taking pictures  of the place.  But I got to go to Bethlehem.  You're going to Bethlehem. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at this poor guy up on a cross.  And they're nailing him up there.  Someone help the man.  Give him some water or something.  And then look at, oh, no.  They're putting thorns on his head.  Just give him a hat.  You don't put thorns on their head.  You give him a police hat.  An NYPD hat.  NYPD.  Yeah.  Oh.  And ladies and gentlemen, that was another episode of Quantum Dice.  Hey, it's Quantum Dice.  Hey, Quantum Dice. 
[04:24:00]  I'm Dr. Dice Beckett.  I go back in history.  I leap.  They call it leaping.  And I got to fix mistakes in history.  So everything's okay now.  See, that's what I do.  I got a happy face, a hologram that helps me out.  And sometimes I communicate with Club Soda Ziggy.  You know, a happy face hits the little light thing and says, I got to help out here. 
[04:24:30]  Some days I wake up.  I look in the mirror after I leap.  I'm a Negro.  And I'm like a ball player.  But sometimes I'm a chick with meat curtains.  And I go, oh, I got meat curtains.  And so once, I remember once I leapt.  And I'm a goddamn retard.  I was a retard, but I was still diced.  But I look in the mirror, and I got a retard face.  I go, I go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Club Soda Ziggy. 
[04:25:00]  I got a retard face.  But then, you know, the next day, I might be a midget.  And I hate the goddamn midgets.  Oh.  So I leap this one time, and I'm in the body of a chick, right?  And then the hell, happy face, the hologram, starts banging me.  Bop.  Bop.  His yambig slapping against my ass.  Oh.  Quantum dice. 
[04:25:30]  Quantum dice.  Next week, dice is in the Nixon administration while Nixon's recording.  Hey, I hate the Jews, too, there, Tricky Dick.  I understand.  They're what you call shifty.  I understand.  We got to bomb the gooks in the nam.  And for sweeps, for sweeps, dice in Saigon.  Hey, I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  How does this happen?  I got to take a boat up the Nung River?  I got to kill some guy. 
[04:26:00]  Look, they napalmed the road.  This poor girl's running down it naked.  Someone help the poor girl.  I hear she's in Texas with a 97-year-old.  Oh, give her a hug.  All right.  Thank you, dice.  Oh, man.  I'm watching Quantum Dice.  Very nice.  That would be a great show.  Quantum Dice.  Quantum Dice.  Anthony on fire today.  Anthony, man.  Hey, Mike, what's going on, bro?  Not to break from what I put on the screen, but I heard Dice was helping with the recovery  effort of the dinosaurs. 
[04:26:30]  A huge tragedy.  A comedy.  All right, Mike.  So how long has this been going on, man?  I mean, he's got...  Yeah, about four years.  We've been watching him slowly, but surely losing.  I'm a comic, so I don't want to rip on a guy, but it seems like he's lost his mind.  It seems.  Well, no, but if comedy goes, most comics get on stage and they say,  I remember this, and then I was on my way to the show.  I mean, what just happened was real, and I don't know about anybody else, but I had  this grin on my face like I just got stoned for the first time, and I could not stop.  Because Anthony was doing exactly what we all wanted to be doing, just shut up.  I know. 
[04:27:00]  He was fired up.  You should see he was bright red.  His head was bright red.  I know.  I'm spitting into the mic.  He's screaming into the mic, and I thought, man, and then all of a sudden, boom, the brilliant  comedy comes out of you.  So you've got to get him fired up until he has a vein sticking out in his head, and then  all of a sudden, boom, fun.  So there you go.  That's the key to get him fired up.  Man.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  Plenty of fun.  Quantum dice.  That's fun.  That's fun.  Come on.  We're having fun today now.  It was really fun.  Well, now we can do an Alamo joke.  I know.  We're...  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:27:30]  We know the dice history, right?  Every time he calls now, you just do quantum dice.  Now we've got to do quantum dice.  You've got a bit forever.  We can always go back to the Alamo.  Oh, there's plenty of history we can work on.  Dude, you went through a textbook already.  You were like...  We went through the history of the world.  I know.  You did like the last 200 years with dice.  Hand me a pen.  I'll sign the Magna Carta.  Doesn't anyone have a pen?  They've got to sign this thing.  That's funny.  You've got to take off?  I've got to go, man.  I've got to go get a sound check. 
[04:28:00]  Oh, he's giving us the signs.  Anthony's giving us the signs.  Sound check.  Well, I'm sorry.  You guys spent so much time talking about my act and how funny I was.  We've beaten Anthony.  Look, I will tell you.  No, I saw you last time.  I saw Christopher last time.  It was very funny.  And it's not just you run in the mill, you know, going there and see a comic.  It's very funny stuff.  Intense stuff.  And it's an amazing chain of events you go through that I brought to you where you are now.  And it's really funny.  We got a standing ovation that you were there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Very good.  They were leaving.  Whatever it was.  Yeah, but they were standing. 
[04:28:30]  I saw they were standing.  They didn't just stand up and go.  They stood up and clapped for a minute.  And then they laughed.  Then they laughed.  That's how good it was.  Guys, appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  I will see you later.  Good luck with the Fox thing, too.  All right, man.  I feel much better when I'm correct.  Hearing Dice, I feel a lot better about my career.  Well, you should.  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you.  All right.  Take it easy, Christopher.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby. 
[04:29:00]  Dice, Dice, baby.  Nicey, nice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the Dice.  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh. 
[04:29:30]  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with balls.  He's a jackal, it's plain to see.  He's a scumbaggy.  Nice be nice. 
[04:30:00]  I'm over here.  Nice be nice.  I'm good like that, my friend.  Get full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  Hey, this is Wayne Newton, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Say, Jim, nice meal.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  And where's Pat from Menachie?  We need the big showstopper today. 
[04:30:30]  Don't blow us off, Pat.  Let's read this fucking faggoty blog.  All right, talking in movie theaters is the headline, current mood, annoyed.  I'm seeing some punctuations that might mean that somebody else might have to read this.  Well, the punctuations are way down over theirs.  All right.  Oh, why?  Because I don't read well?  Oh.  Why do you get a shit on Elp, dude?  Why do you get a day before vacation?  I was, it was. 
[04:31:00]  You could just come out and say it instead of.  I saw big capital letters with exclamation points, and I thought.  Well, you could just say it instead of like.  Perhaps midjmi.  That's stupid.  I know what it means when you said that.  You don't want me to read this.  Why would you do that, Anthony?  I'm going to read it upside down.  Sometimes I do that.  To look happy.  Say Frank DeFronter.  We want that character to last.  Okay.  Don't mean to tear down the fifth wall or nothing.  What are you saying?  That character's getting old?  I had a good one, too, for Frank DeFronter. 
[04:31:30]  Absolutely.  I had a good one.  Somebody just wants to go home.  You just held it.  I got about four minutes left.  Let's go, because I'm in overtime right now.  This is a talking in movie theater, so that would be an annoyed.  Okay.  Opie, you want to read this?  I obviously can't read.  Now there's a problem.  People just tell me.  Jesus Christ.  Opie.  I can read the signs.  The one thing I am is smart. 
[04:32:00]  Look, there's three paragraphs here.  And I'm really good at reading people.  Here it is.  I can't read things, but I'm good at reading people.  There's like three solid segments to this.  You read the first one.  Let Midge me read the second one.  Let Bob read the first one.  How about Bob reads the whole thing?  Let Bob read the first one.  I'm not reading that.  All right.  Are you ready?  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Opie.  Because I'm dumber than anybody in this room.  All right.  You're not going to get an argument from anyone.  Read away.  Jeez, I'm sticking up for you.  I know.  I just saw X-Men 3. 
[04:32:30]  Wasn't a big fan of the movie.  Not as good as the others.  But this...  Shit.  Posting isn't about that.  On the show, there was an old bit where Anthony went to see Mission Impossible Deuce,  and people wouldn't shut up in the movie theater.  I happened to be in the same area.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is that?  Get him. 
[04:33:00]  I got him.  Get him.  I got him.  Get him.  I got him.  Pat from Munaki had his asshole open while Bob was reading.  JP.  Totally distracted him.  That's why I said Bob reads.  I heard Pat was here.  So, Bob's reading.  Pat from Munaki comes up right next to him, pulls his pants down, and spreads his ass cheeks. 
[04:33:30]  And then...  And Big Kev, good call for coming in the wrist print.  Very nice.  And then who said, like, Bobby, look.  I did.  I did.  Yeah, he goes, Bob, look.  Listen, listen.  Bob turned his head.  Oh, God.  He turned his head and was point-blank right into Pat's... 
[04:34:00]  Wait, dude, please.  Pat's asshole.  You creep with the microphone.  Dude, I really want you to take Bob's phone.  Oh, God.  And not do anything off with it, but just put it against the back of your balls and take  a picture of it and show it to him while he's on the phone.  Oh, God.  Someone call him.  Yeah, dude.  Yes.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Hurry, hurry.  Hurry, quick.  Make sure he doesn't demand.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Quick.  Turn around, stupid.  We'll erase the picture if you don't want it published. 
[04:34:30]  Get the microphone.  Put it right on it.  Put it on your ball.  Touch it.  Yeah.  No, the mouth part on your asshole.  Put it against it.  Put it against it.  Oh, God.  Okay.  All right.  Now put it back.  Now put it back where it was.  Put your pants up, my fucking homo.  Put it exactly where it was.  Danny, put it in the sleeve or I'll stab you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  And then somebody call him during the show here.  I know.  What's his number?  All right.  Hold on.  Bob.  He's coming back. 
[04:35:00]  Holy shit.  That is so fucking wrong.  What?  Hope this works out.  What, dude?  Just come back in.  Everything's all right.  That's horrible.  Let me see.  Oh, God, dude.  Let me see, Iraq.  That's fucking gross.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, God damn.  This asshole is brown.  Yeah.  Brown and yellow.  You should have got the phone.  You all right?  You should have got the phone against it.  We do. 
[04:35:30]  It was yellow and brown and purple.  Yeah.  Believe me.  All right.  Listen.  Mike's got it.  Mike's got it.  Let's sit.  All right, listen.  We're doing a bit.  Oh, by the way, save this for when we get back.  Seriously.  Tell him to test his cell phone and call you or something like that.  Tell him to do it.  Like we're doing something else.  We always have competitions about phones.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe I could say.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Someone just calls his number from outside the studio.  No, you might have answered.  Let's make it like we're talking about our phones.  Who cares if he answers?  Because mine, it's small. 
[04:36:00]  Bobby.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  He's got his pants on.  And I don't care what he's got his pants on.  Dude, you're assholes.  No, that is disgusting.  Commitable.  And I don't care.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Come in, stupid.  Bring it, Bobby.  I'm not a fan.  I don't hate my phone.  No, listen.  Listen, speaking of phones.  No fucking way.  Bob.  What?  Tell these guys what was happening.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Nothing.  Shut up.  I don't fucking trust you guys.  Actually.  What's happening? 
[04:36:30]  I'll tell you.  Listen.  We all got phones in your hands.  No, tell the guys what happens with your phone.  It hangs up on itself because of your fat cheeks.  Did he hit the phone in his ass?  No.  Oh.  Is that a ring?  Why didn't we think of it?  No, actually.  My what?  This is actually a legitimate question.  While you were puking and cleaning up.  We thought it was funny because you were talking about it.  When you answer phone calls, you hang up on yourself because you're a fat cheek.  Mine absolutely will not.  Can I tell you guys something?  You don't go from fucking zero to 60.  Hold on.  You were puking.  We were trying to talk to you. 
[04:37:00]  You didn't have fucking headphones.  So the bit was kind of done.  I can't get his asshole out of my head.  So we got into the fact that he told about when you hung up with your fat cheek.  And I said, that's why I have fucking flip phones.  I said this thing wrong.  This is absolutely.  That's you.  I said this wrong.  It will say that it's calling.  But I won't hear anything.  Because I have a setting.  Listen.  And I'll only have a flip phone.  It's connected.  Look.  Because assholes.  Answer and talk to me.  But do not.  Assholes.  Tell me if you can hear me.  And fucking call you from the car.  And they don't even know that they're fucking talking to you. 
[04:37:30]  He's checking out the phone.  It's fine.  Just do it.  You idiot.  It's not ringing.  Huh?  I'm not an idiot.  I'm a human being.  Pick it up.  And you will hear it.  I'm not an idiot.  I'm a human being.  We didn't do anything to your phone.  Look.  It's not ringing.  I'm looking at the fucking phone.  Why is this not?  It says.  Oh, wait.  Last call.  Hold on.  You probably hop on it.  I don't have your number.  No.  Mine says connected.  Huh?  I need your number.  Three, four, seven.  I don't even have it.  Don't give out his fucking number on me.  You got it?  See, now it says connected.  Seven, eight.  Your phone stinks.  That's why.  No, it's just. 
[04:38:00]  I have a setting wrong.  What's going on?  Try it.  Do you want me to call you?  Try it.  Try what?  Call me.  I guarantee you.  I want to see if it will ring.  We never exchange numbers.  Like, I don't.  You don't like Bob.  I just got like.  Bob, I now like you.  Like, Dan's number is pretty much the only person I have that I really shouldn't have.  Is it ringing?  Yeah, but watch.  Now, it's ringing.  Yeah.  Hello?  No.  Yeah, hello.  Do you hear anything from me? 
[04:38:30]  No.  No.  I just.  I'm connected.  It does ring.  But now watch.  This is why I have this fucking headphone.  They'll bust my balls about this to the headphones.  Goddamn fucking air traffic controller.  Yeah, I know.  But look at this.  Now it's plugged in.  The headphones plug in.  I hear you great.  See?  Now, this is through my headphone here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I can somehow.  Or that one.  Yeah.  I can hit you.  The fuck is that, dude?  That's.  I mean, it's fucking. 
[04:39:00]  It's like.  What's wrong, Bob?  This is a fucking vagina.  What's wrong, Bob?  No, it's not.  I don't think you got a good enough look at it.  Please get that.  Wait, Bob.  There's something a little different about that picture.  Bob, you might want to look at that.  Mike.  Uh, uh, Bob.  You might want to look at that picture a little closely.  I don't want to look at that.  No, just.  Did he put the fucking phone?  Zoom up.  Well, just take a little look at it.  Just take a look.  Oh! 
[04:39:30]  You put my phone in your ass, you fucking savage.  No.  Just get into the back of the phone.  Just the back of the phone.  Dude, wash my fucking phone.  That's over the line.  That's over the line.  A fucking bagel on the ground is one thing.  Show me.  You put my fucking 700-dollar trio in his asshole.  Who fucking does that?  That's over the line.  They made me.  You didn't fucking have to stick in your ass, you circus freak.  You fucking cocksucker.  Now you owe me 700. 
[04:40:00]  I'm not fucking with that phone anymore.  You stuck it in your fucking fat pussy.  I paid for a new one with my winnings, too.  Did he stick it in his ass?  I didn't even look at the photo.  No!  Look at the photo.  You have to.  Look at the photo.  You might be happy.  Don't worry.  Don't do Irish hammer.  Don't worry so much.  Your mic went out, Jimmy.  Look at the picture.  The mic went out.  He's looking at the picture now.  Here.  Oh, he's fuking.  You all right, Bob? 
[04:40:30]  Oh, God.  Bob, you all right?  What's wrong with this asshole?  Has a phone in it.  I'm with you on that.  I really don't know, but there is something wrong with this.  Dude, you're an asshole.  Did you fucking...  Did you see the phone in the picture?  A plane cracker go off?  It really is red and open.  22 Nathan's hot dogs went through that asshole.  Dude, it looks like an open wound.  Yeah.  It looks like a fucking...  See your phone?  E-Rock, you're off the hook.  Your face was right at the right now.  We'll read the blog when we get back.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta wash my phone now, because his fucking cunt was in it.  That's fine.  What was it? 
[04:41:00]  The mouth part, stupid.  The part you put up to your face.  The ear part.  Oh, God.  How can anybody not like that?  Bob, by the way, I'm sorry I called you a liar.  I'm sorry.  Bob, look at me for a second. 
[04:41:30]  Bob.  Bob, turn around, please.  Jimmy's ass is right in his face.  Poor Bob has such a...  Bob, Bob!  He has such a very...  He has a sour stuff.  Sour stuff.  No, he doesn't have any...  What is that called?  Stomach bile left. 
[04:42:00]  Some people can take that shit.  That is good.  Others, like...  He's got no constitution for that kind of thing.  All right.  The phone...  When he saw the picture of the phone touching the back of your ball sack.  That echoes.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  He pukes on Torgasm a bunch, too, man.  He's the real deal. 
[04:42:30]  Bob!  God damn fucking...  Bob!  Can he hear us in there?  No.  Yeah, I got you.  Bob!  How'd the phone smell?  Oh, his fucking ass was in my phone.  You're a...  You're a good sport.  You're a good sport to the Opie and Anthony show.  You all right?  You feeling any better?  Why would you put my fucking phone in something like that?  In something like that.  Pat's gonna cry. 
[04:43:00]  It's not that bad.  You should talk on that phone again.  You should get that fucking tumor removed.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that.  I don't even want to know.  Jim, is that Jim?  What?  Jim, don't.  I don't want to see your ass, Jim.  Yeah, Jimmy told me to stall.  Jim, are you pissing on the ground?  Dude, you're pissing on the ground.  What kind of fucking freak show is this?  Jimmy will just walk in the bathroom and start pissing on the floor. 
[04:43:30]  He's a fucking animal.  Oh, God.  Just put down wood chips for him.  Like wood shavings.  He's like a fucking hamster.  How do you wash his cell phone?  You don't.  By the way, Danny the trucker is saying,  and this is revenge for Bob's anti-trucker promo he did.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's exactly it.  All right, are you boys done in there?  Oh, God.  Bob?  Yeah, I'm coming.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  I think I'm puking up blood. 
[04:44:00]  No.  Yeah, blood just came out.  No way.  Yep.  All right.  What happened, Mars?  He wants the wipes.  Give me the wipe.  Why are you...  Oh, he's got to wipe your phone.  Oh, he's going to sterilize your phone with the lights on it.  Dude, I can hear you, you cocksucker.  You little dirt monger.  Well, what do you think he said?  He said something.  What's he doing?  I'm not coming.  What do you think, stupid?  What do you think he's doing?  I don't know.  Oh, don't... 
[04:44:30]  What's wrong?  Oh, he's running.  Oh, he's running.  Oh, he's running.  Oh, he's running.  He just kicked back in the knee.  Don't kick him.  He's kicking back.  Hey, Bob!  He's kicking back.  Bob is fucking leaving.  Bob is pissed.  He just threw a Danish...  At the side of the side. 
[04:45:00]  At the side of the side.  He doesn't give a crap.  We're out of here.  We're out of here.  Bob Kelly, thank you!  Thank you, Bob.  This is Bob Kelly, and...  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to The Worst Of on ONA.  That sounded good.  You're supposed to...  What?  Opie and Anthony?  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  Thanks for telling me what I was supposed to say.  Hey, just wing it. 
[04:45:30]  And I wung it, and then you fucking winged it right back in my face.  Good for you, Steve.  You fucking jack off.  Hey, why do you...  Hey, Bob.  Just wondering why you stink on all your things.  I don't know, because Steve just sits there, push a button, puts headphones on, and then  fucking shows me his ball sack and helps me nothing.  Okay?  How's that sound?  The fuck, dude?  I'm only good when there's a crowd of more than five people, and we're in a basement.  I'm kidding.  Come here.  Say something.  This is Bob Kelly, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony.  On XM Satellite Radio. 
[04:46:00]  Hey, this is Rob Kelly, and...  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Do you always speak like you're reading something off a wall?  Listen.  Here, we'll do it again.  This is Bob...  Hey, this is Bob Kelly, and...  This is Francine.  And you're listening to The Worst of on Opie and Anthony.  Jesus.  What?  Just say it.  I suck cock.  You do, and you have abortions.  Oh, lots of...  I only had one abortion.  Well, it was a fake abortion.  It wasn't a fake. 
[04:46:30]  A little head came out of you.  I don't give a shit.  Ugh.  I don't give a shit.  All right, this is...  Thanks, Bob.  Jesus Christ, you just hit me like fucking Joe Frazier.  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to The Worst of on Opie and Anthony.  This is Bob...  I fucked it up because it's...  Give me read it.  Here we go.  Ready?  We're just going to do a one shot.  Ready?  And this is what we should do in the beginning.  Here we go.  From now on, Steve.  Ready?  I walk in here.  Hey, what do you...  Hey, can you do a Worst of?  And you go, yeah.  What do you want me to do?  Read...  Just read this, Bob, and add your name underneath the line where it's blank. 
[04:47:00]  Okay?  So this is what I'll do.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, you fucked that up, too.  How'd I fuck that up?  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, dude, I'm not a radio fucking pro like you.  The worst.  The worst.  You got big muscles, but you got small hips.  Listen.  All right.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Oh. 
[04:47:30]  Hey.  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to the Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Was that good?  I got it good?  Are you shitting me?  Play that back.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you were saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs.  What?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando?  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God.  I tried to forget it.  Well, what happened?  You walked in on them?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:48:00]  Early Saturday morning.  You opened?  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was mom taking it from behind, or what?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over the shoulders.  Whoa.  Wow.  That's the hi, how you doing?  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh.  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But, like, were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh? 
[04:48:30]  I think my mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Opie, man, you got...  Who, are you, Rick, today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning, and I'm terrible.  Think I'm spaz? 
[04:49:00]  Hey, this kid's quick.  Even 12-year-olds can go on spaz.  So did you enjoy it?  I mean, was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Yeah, I guess.  That's pretty embarrassing, huh?  Yeah, I guess so.  So your mom's like a big gal?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  He does it.  And your dad's pretty big.  I look like two pigs fighting over a milk thug. 
[04:49:30]  Keith, you rule, man.  That is funny.  Keith, we got to go drink beers with you, man.  Oh, man.  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question.  What hole does he go into?  I bet you know...  My father said, whatever one's open.  Oh, my God. 
[04:50:00]  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I guess you'll do okay.  All right.  Anything else?  Rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck. 
[04:50:30]  All right.  So does your mom, Keith.  I can't believe Steve at that porn convention said that he was desensitized to...  Because Monday he was talking about how he was desensitized to the...  My vagina.  Desensitized to the vagina.  This chick that we were talking to, you know some people will rest their hands on their belt loops.  She had like skin-tight pants and was pulling them out like two or three inches.  So you could see...  You could see everything. 
[04:51:00]  Full beef.  And that's nice.  Get Steve.  That's nice.  I think he was upset because his bear dar was going off around the convention.  Bear.  Grr.  Grr.  You hear this yet?  Listen to it.  Bear.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  And we got an unenthusiastic bear.  Steve.  Yeah.  Laszlo has a problem with you.  Yeah.  Kind of calling you out a little bit.  How you're bored with the vag.  You're boredom with the female genitalia. 
[04:51:30]  He did make sure to point out the big Harley-looking guy that had a vagina.  Did you see that guy?  Yeah.  Well, because there was a big poster next to him.  You didn't see that guy?  I think his name is Buck Angel, actually.  He has a huge, huge display.  Are you talking while I'm talking?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Are you going to take that?  Steve is going to choke Jimmy.  Oh.  Oh.  Steve, your phone's ringing.  I'm going to answer my phone.  Oh.  Stop.  All right. 
[04:52:00]  What's the deal?  Can Danny be Dr. Dan?  Ooh.  I like that.  Just, you know, hey, we got Dr. Dan in the studio.  Or maybe Danny Hatz.  Because he always wears hats.  Oh, good.  That's good.  Dr. Dan's better, though.  It sounds better.  Yeah.  It sounds more zoo-ish.  Yeah.  So Laszlo's calling you out on the whole being bored with the vag.  I didn't notice.  Thank you.  I didn't notice Delilah's beef when she was talking.  Where does the complete, like, lack of interest in female genitalia come from there?  It's not lack of interest.  I tried hard to dissent.  There's a little boredom with women.  Not.  And now this attraction to men in leather and studs. 
[04:52:30]  Who said that?  You're summing.  He's summing it up.  That's not summing it up.  That's fabricating completely.  You hear the word pussy, you go, pah.  We like to summarize on this show.  That's not even summary.  Yes, it is.  I don't know how.  We have a bibliography and everything.  You know why?  Because I was talking to her.  I didn't want to talk to her tits or her crotch while I was talking to her.  So why?  Yeah, she had a point star.  That would be offensive.  Yeah, God forbid.  Why would you want to look at her tits?  Yeah, especially when she's talking about it.  She's been sucking cock since she was 12. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah.  The last thing you want to do is look down at her vag.  She might get offended.  Trying to be nice.  Better to focus on the chest of that other gentleman.  What?  I agree with him.  How good looking are pussies to look at?  They're fucking horrible.  Thank you, Rich.  No, they're horrible.  They're a wonderful gift from God.  Are you saying Bonnie has a bad pussy?  I'm not saying names.  That would be his gay comment for the show.  What's that?  No, bullshit.  What's wrong with you?  If you look at it broad, a naked broad, the first thing you look at is how good looking  she is.  You're going to look at her face.  Okay?  Who cares?  Do you understand? 
[04:53:30]  I don't care if she fucking looks like Rocky Dennis.  I don't notice until we're eating afterwards.  It doesn't excite me.  You're wrong.  I would look at a pretty girl-  You don't like looking at a vag?  Usually the vag looks like Rocky Dennis.  No, it's not that exciting.  I like a fucking-  I don't like big tits.  I like firm, hard, nice, firm, hard.  You don't like tits of a vagina.  You're a homo, Rich.  I know.  What else don't you like?  A little bit of hair on the chest.  Maybe a six-pack.  Okay.  No, listen.  You guys don't get it.  You think, oh, wow.  Look at that pussy.  Thank God we don't get it.  We just don't get it.  Yeah, we don't get it.  Look at that pussy. 
[04:54:00]  All right, we're playing the wrong answer game.  What do you like, Rich?  Pussy.  If you look at any of these hot girls on the wall here, you look at their face and go,  she's hot.  You don't look at her-  Because the tits and snap are going, she's hot.  Because they're not showing their pussy.  Okay.  They're just showing their face.  Do you really think that excites anybody?  Yes.  Are you serious?  What are you talking about, your guy?  That actually does.  That's a lovely picture of a vagina.  It does, that gets you excited?  Yes.  That is a roast beef sandwich worth jumping into. 
[04:54:30]  It's not, it doesn't do it.  If there was, look at that, pimples on the ass.  Yeah, no wonder you're having trouble with Bonnie.  I'm not having any trouble.  Get that awful vagina away from me.  No, you're wrong.  Isolate that.  I can't believe you said that guys aren't excited by that.  That, what's connected to it?  It just, it looks like-  Who cares?  It looks like roast beef.  Stick a dick in it.  Well, that's for guys that can't get laid.  What vaginas for guys that can't get laid?  You heard it here, folks.  You know, Rich Voss.  Is he un-Cola-Cola? 
[04:55:00]  Rich Voss playing Caroline.  He's brilliant.  China is for guys that can't get laid.  That's right.  Pussy for total faggots.  He's the gay Dennis Miller, everyone.  Enjoy.  And the vag was looking at me.  That's a lovely one.  Wait, what was that quote?  I don't want to forget that quote ever.  Vaginas for guys that can't get laid.  Only rich.  Only rich.  You're wrong.  I like a fat-  If I see, like, a big meat pussy, it does excite me. 
[04:55:30]  More than the face or anything.  Are you serious?  Without the whole body connecting, the whole face and everything, just a pussy on a screen  excites you.  Yes.  Yes.  I like the body, too.  I'm not a fucking-  I don't want to just cut her torso in half.  Don't isolate it like that.  Not at first, at least.  After sex, you do.  Without blood in it, you know, of course I like the whole body, but I like-  If I see a picture of a pussy, it looks- and it's a big, fat, awful one, it just- it drives  me nuts.  Yes.  And this was the difference at the porn convention, because there were chicks, like, making out 
[04:56:00]  up on these pedestals and gyrating and finger-blasting themselves, and Steve's looking like,  yeah, whatever.  And Jimmy is pushing people out of the way to get a better look.  Jimmy will always want to see what that badge looks like.  Always.  Yeah.  All right, wait.  People are just losing it on the phones.  Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Voss.  Hey, Captain Brian.  Holy fuck are you talking about?  You don't-  God.  I'm sorry, but you know what?  The first thing I don't look at the face, I look for some toilet clogging kits is the  first thing that I'm looking for on a chick.  Then the pussy's second, but Jesus Christ. 
[04:56:30]  But I got to defend Voss, dude.  I got to defend-  What Voss is saying, and I understand what he's saying, don't misinterpret.  He's a faggot who loves cock.  Okay.  I don't want that to get lost.  Voss needs one of those calendars with like a quote a day.  Every day you get a Voss quote.  It'd be nice.  Yeah, but I'm serious, man.  The first thing I'm looking at, the tits.  I don't even know their face.  Okay, you're looking at the tits.  Like on that picture, I would look at her face and tits first, because the pussy's far  away.  Gaping like that, I don't like.  I don't need a pussy gaping.  I like just a pussy like when she's standing there. 
[04:57:00]  You don't want a pussy to look disinterested in you.  Exactly.  All right, he's going to fuck you.  I don't want a pussy to look like the scream poster.  Poster.  You know what I mean?  Poster.  Old Buffalo Bill pussy.  And you like these long pussies that hang like rubber gloves.  All right, yeah, show them that one.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  That's a work of art.  That's a nice, first of all, it's a nice pussy.  There's nothing that connects. 
[04:57:30]  It's just like a hole on the screen.  What do you mean there's nothing that connects?  You're just showing the pussy.  It looks like an aerial view of Mars.  It fucking stinks.  Well, the color, it's artistic.  I don't like it.  All those bumps in it.  It looks like a reptile.  That right there looks like some kind of fucking crocodile or something.  Those bumps, that's young skin.  It looks like a Chinese eye.  That's awful.  Okay, here's the deal.  If you were home, say you were horny and you were ready to spank it or whatever, and that  was all you had to look at, would that get you excited? 
[04:58:00]  As opposed to what?  As opposed to what?  Maybe the whole girl, maybe the girl playing with herself, maybe the girl making out with  another girl.  I could absolutely jack off to that.  To just that right there.  Sure.  What you would need is the mental image of slowly putting your dick in it.  Now, that wouldn't do it for me, because I don't like that pussy.  Something you don't like to do.  I don't like that one.  What are you kidding me?  Bud, vagina's only for guys that, you know.  What was the quote?  Just say it, Rich.  I can't get laid.  Just say it.  That's not as fun without a cock in the picture.  It's not a big deal. 
[04:58:30]  No, that's exciting, too, watching girls, you know, girls blow guys.  That's exciting.  You keep digging deeper, bro.  Watching girls with cocks and balls and no tips.  Okay, get a picture.  Get that.  Get this picture right here, right?  Or take a picture of a girl blowing some guy.  Yeah, that is sexy.  That's way more exciting.  I don't care what anybody says.  It's not gay.  It's more exciting watching you go like that.  You want to look at a good cock, right?  Well, you don't want it.  You want it cut.  You don't want it uncut to begin with.  This is fucking Voss's internal conflict. 
[04:59:00]  You're listening to a man going off the deep end.  This is his inner voice all day he drives.  You want to see a cock in there, but not for gay reasons, just because you can relate to it.  What was your air steering?  A truck?  What does he drive?  A semi?  Yes, he does.  You air drive a car that's steering wheel is at a 90-degree angle to your body.  He doesn't drive a semi.  He holds one in his face.  I'll tell you, do the pictures.  Cut the screen and do the picture, and I guarantee it looks more. 
[04:59:30]  Whatever.  When you're watching porn, when you're watching porn.  Hold on.  Kevin from Ohio is going to help you out, Rich.  Kevin.  All right.  Hey, Rich.  Are mouths for guys who don't like getting their dick sucked like yourself?  Wow.  Rich, answer?  Bird in West Virginia.  Bird?  Yeah, Voss is a faggot.  Here's the deal.  They could say, these are guys that don't get laid.  Rich, I get laid on the time.  No, not you.  You know what I'm saying.  Not for free, but I get it. 
[05:00:00]  You know what I'm saying.  Let's go to Tom in Tennessee.  Tom.  Hey, what the fuck did Bonnie do?  Nooter you, Voss?  Yeah, that's what happened.  He got married.  No, no.  You got married, and now you can't get on the air.  He's saying, don't just look at a girl for pussy.  What about her personality?  Right.  If you wouldn't get punched right now, you'd say, what about her personality?  You would get punched.  You got married, and it took your balls away.  No, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  Are you kidding me?  I don't watch pornos.  I try to steal pornos from here every time I come in here to bring home.  And you're allowed to watch them.  Of course.  You try to steal pornos.  Not pornos.  I always ask for the pornos in the background. 
[05:00:30]  And you both watch them.  Yes, yes.  Well, of course.  You sit there and watch them.  But if on the screen you just saw a pussy, how exciting is that?  But if you see the girl performing something, that's exciting.  And you know what?  Do you discuss what you each like in these pornos?  She can't discuss it with duct tape on her mouth.  I do all the talking.  Okay?  That was not a bad line.  That was okay.  It was okay.  But you know what?  See, it's easy to go, oh, he's a faggot.  But no, you don't get the point.  It's just boring. 
[05:01:00]  Just pussy sitting there by pussy by itself is boring.  Yeah, pussy's awful.  Oh, no worries.  Jennifer from Atlanta.  Jennifer?  It's easy to say he's a faggot.  Yes, remarkably.  Jennifer?  Hello?  Yes, Jennifer.  Am I on the air?  Yes, Jennifer.  Yes, Jennifer, you are.  What do you want to talk to Opie and Anthony about?  I just wanted to say a dick isn't so good to look at either.  I would go to a strip club, like a female strip club, but I wouldn't go to a male strip club. 
[05:01:30]  And Voss is gay.  I'm gay?  Yeah.  All right, I think John from Indiana sums it up here.  John?  Yeah, man, I wonder what the hell you're talking about, Voss.  You'd rather see a girl sucking a guy's dick?  No, per se.  I would rather see just one pussy than a picture of 15 pussies with a dick in the left-hand corner.  No, because you know what?  Here's the thing.  See, everybody's so homophobic.  It's not that.  When you watch porno, do you ever watch a guy fucking another girl in porno? 
[05:02:00]  I like to see a cock in the picture, too.  I know what you mean.  I like to see a blowjob more than just a pussy.  I'll go through On Demand, and I'll watch all 10 lesbian porns before I even look at a rick.  You know what?  Because, you know what?  I disagree with him on that one.  What's that?  I disagree with the guy.  He's wrong.  It's not.  You're not gay.  You're just watching, you know.  Yeah, well, you are.  You're not a crazy frame you are.  But, I mean, like, most of us like porn because we like to.  I like to see a cock in there, too.  I mean, you might be kidding if you go.  If she's blowing a guy, and you go, she's lucky, then, you know. 
[05:02:30]  A nice cock.  A nice cock.  Something like that.  Blinky the Fish from Springfield.  The first thing Jimmy looks for in a woman is evidence of traumatic childhood.  I really do.  I kind of approach her quickly, and if she, like, blinks and backs off, I'm in.  Fuck that up.  Josh Tampa, what's up?  I just want to reiterate that Voss is a gob-noblin pillow-vite and fuck-face.  He doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.  You know what?  You could say what you could go.  It's easy.  He's gay, this and that.  How much pussy do you get, sir?  Are you married? 
[05:03:00]  I'm engaged.  Are you engaged?  Is she hot?  Is she hot?  She's gorgeous.  All right.  So, what do you call it?  I didn't say.  When you're watching porno, do you watch porno with her?  No, we don't.  You don't?  Then it's boring.  What do you do?  Do you use dildos?  Do you use vibrators or anything?  I don't need to, man.  Why is it boring if you don't watch porno with your chick?  Well, not porno.  Not sometimes or toys or whatever.  What, you just regular fucking...  Yeah, you're reaching now.  God forbid you do some of that regular fucking... 
[05:03:30]  Or you have an amazing imagination and you're just turned on by the person next to you.  God forbid that happens to you.  But Patrice comes in with two suitcases full of dildos and it's okay.  I'm talking about...  No, we railed him on that too as being a pervert.  Yeah, he's also a fucking piece of shit who's not capable of intimacy or human contact.  What do you...  No one thinks that Patrice is a decent human being.  He's garbage.  Yes, James from Florida.  James.  Hey, the Academy would like to recognize Rich Voss for Brokeback Mountain.  Mike in Long Island. 
[05:04:00]  Mike.  Pussy's boring, but being in a sleeping bag, that's fine.  Yeah, right.  Mike?  What's going on?  What's up?  Hang on, I'm on with O&A.  Yo, what's up, boys?  I just wanted to tell you, first off, I kind of see where voices come from because I kind  of, I don't know, even if I...  Yeah, so do we, Chelsea.  I got to have a strap on or something.  I got to see some kind of penis because I got to see what's going on, you know?  But I was actually calling because I just wanted to praise little Jimmy.  I love the other guys.  Don't get me wrong. 
[05:04:30]  Patrice and whatever, the redhead guy, you know.  How soon they forget.  Look how quickly.  But I love them.  But Jimmy is just a whole nother level.  Jimmy's the greatest.  Cool, sweetie.  And I can't stop laughing when I hear him talk.  He's the best.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Let's go to Bobby in Jersey.  Bobby.  That's a new show on Fox.  How's everybody doing?  Hey.  I got to tell you, Vaughn, you are a faggot.  What about Playboy and Benhouse?  Didn't you take magazines when you were a kid?  Yes, you're right, but it was the whole picture, right?  It wasn't just a pussy. 
[05:05:00]  It was the whole picture of the broad, wasn't it?  The centerfold wasn't just a pussy there.  It was a hot girl.  Not in the 50s when you were looking at it.  Okay.  So I rest my case.  The centerfold wasn't just a pussy.  You know what else you should rest?  What?  Your hands and your knees on the floor and allow another gentleman to stand behind you.  Wow.  That's what you should rest.  That was a long way to go for us.  Do you think it's more gay to kiss a guy or blow a guy?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Holy.  Wow.  The internal conflict continues.  What's more gay than both of those things is asking the question. 
[05:05:30]  Why don't you go ask JV and Elvis?  Exactly.  Have fun with that one.  Maybe later on, you pre-interview, you ask him that question.  I'd have to say blowing him as more gay.  It has to be.  I mean...  No, it's great.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Jason from Ohio.  Jason.  Hey, first I want to know what he thinks about lesbians.  Second off, who put Voss Comes Out on my MyFight?  Is that on the pad?  Oh, we're changing the pad.  That's funny.  I had fun with it.  Voss Comes Out.  Yeah.  All right.  But it was about Steve.  Steve was the one that was bored with the vaginal. 
[05:06:00]  Well, Steve is the original faggot, and then Voss kind of jumped in and defended him.  It's not a gay thing.  It's, you know, looking at two girls that are fully clothed, you know, pole dancing,  ten feet up in the air, isn't exciting, especially when there's a hundred other douchebags  around you slack-jawed looking up at them.  That's, you know, it was boring.  All right.  We got a song for Steve.  Mike the Unhuman.  Oh, fuck.  Sexy Vag to Steve the Bear.  Sexy Vag to Steve the Bear. 
[05:06:30]  Take a gander at what's waiting way down here.  Sexy Vag to Steve the Bear.  Hot and sexy, got no hair.  Please stop groping homos and check out the vag is here. 
[05:07:00]  This is Sexy Vag to Steve the Bear.  You're acting kind of gay.  Grr, grr.  And the pest, they want to know whose team you're on.  Grr, grr.  Maybe it's time to leave the closet.  Am I wrong?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[05:07:30]  This is Steve the Bear, the sexy Vag.  You've made a big mistake.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And I'm not just any pussy, can't you see?  You say pussy, don't you say that name to me  Alright, not bad.  Tuna can, Charlie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Alright.  I have to agree with Voss. 
[05:08:00]  I gotta have a nice looking face to go along with the whole...  One is sexier.  I agree, just a photo of a pussy, I'd prefer to have more than that.  But the way he's looking at it, if I see a photo and it's just a fat, bulging, I do  prefer to have the rest of the woman so I can almost see how big the pussy is compared  to the rest of her.  I like that.  Well, of course you want the whole package.  That's silly thinking you wouldn't, but the thing, I think the point here is the fact  that Rich is saying that the pussy isn't just part of the package, but alone, it is ridiculous 
[05:08:30]  and not sexy at all.  No, it's only there for guys that can't get laid.  Like, obviously, you want to see the full girl.  Well, that's what I was saying in the beginning.  Pussies, a pussy there doesn't do it for me.  But if the whole girl does, that doesn't mean I'm gay.  It certainly does.  No, you're wrong.  That's being married.  Listen, if he could get away with it, let me see, if he could get away with it right  now, he would go, you have to know what her political beliefs are.  You have to know how she feels.  No, but if the girl...  Is she funny?  Well, if she could make you laugh, that's a whole other thing. 
[05:09:00]  That's great, too.  When is it great?  After you fuck?  That's great.  But I've never once, when I have a fucking meat pussy, when it looks like poorly packed  luggage, and it's just dangling over my face, and it smells like tinkle, I don't care what  her sense of humor is.
