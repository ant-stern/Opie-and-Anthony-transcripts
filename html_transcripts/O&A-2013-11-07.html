<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in a vulgar and offensive banter filled with crude jokes and comments.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a review of Beats by Dre headphones, with the hosts debating their sound quality, especially the bass, and their suitability for different applications.  This segued into a lengthy discussion about copyright infringement in music, focusing on Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'" and "Run This Town," with direct comparisons of the sampled music played on-air. The hosts expanded the discussion to include Led Zeppelin, Coldplay, Vanilla Ice, Elvis Presley, and Kiss, playing snippets of songs to illustrate alleged plagiarism. A caller even brought up a perceived similarity between a Kiss and a Pearl Jam guitar solo.  Throughout this segment, the hosts continued their pattern of using highly offensive and sexually explicit language.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a blues song, mocking its repetitive lyrics and an English version deemed the "gayest song ever." This led to praise for Rammstein's German music and further musical commentary, including discussions of ZZ Top's stage performances and Jamiroquai's "Virtual Insanity" video.  A brief call with a listener, Matt, was interrupted by a discussion of Nicole's pregnancy and speculation about a coworker, Dennis Falcone, possibly being on the autism spectrum.

Next, the hosts discussed Bill Burr's rising success as highlighted by a Rolling Stone article comparing him to Louis C.K., and a documentary about Jack White's instrument making, "It Might Get Loud."  They commented on Jack White's perceived arrogance and a negative personal experience with him.  Bob Kelly's podcast, featuring an on-stage sex act involving dildos, was also briefly mentioned.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a news story about a New Mexico man subjected to extensive and arguably unconstitutional anal examinations after a minor traffic stop.  The hosts expressed outrage, prompting numerous calls from listeners, including law enforcement officers, debating the legality and ethics of the incident. Ray Kelly's departure from the NYPD was briefly discussed. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the New Mexico incident, Bill Burr's opinion, Richie Incognito's name, NFL hazing, and Tony Dorsett's struggles with head injuries and the NFL settlement, culminating in a somber discussion about Dorsett's health problems and potential link to concussions.

Comedian Bill Burr then joined the show as a guest.  The conversation initially revolved around the relative toughness of American football and rugby, using profane language to discuss head injuries and their long-term effects on athletes like Tony Dorsett and Muhammad Ali. Burr recounted humorous anecdotes from the set of "The Heat," including Melissa McCarthy's improvisational style and a dramatic exit from a scene. False tabloid rumors linking Burr and Bullock were addressed.  The conversation turned to fan interactions, celebrity photo requests, and a humorous anecdote from Rich Voss about Don Cheadle.  The Rolling Stone article comparing Burr to Louis C.K. was discussed, along with the financial struggles of some athletes after retirement, using examples such as Dr. J and Bobby Orr. Vanilla Ice's career was briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with a graphic description of a brawl at a Red Sox parade, a discussion on how different ethnic groups handle post-fight interactions, cynicism towards the NFL's pink breast cancer awareness campaign, Burr promoting his podcast and network, "All Things Comedy," a brief mention of an interview with Tim Conway, and a discussion of a bizarre commercial for "Moment Shunts."

A further segment featured Bill Burr, along with actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  The show began with an anecdote about Opie, Jimmy Norton, and Burr waiting to meet Bill Cosby, with a staff member, Kenny, expediting their access.  The conversation shifted to Bill Cosby's career, including opinions on his later films. Burr recounted a humorous anecdote about meeting Cosby. Akinnuoye-Agbaje joined, discussing his roles in *Thor: The Dark World*, *Oz*, and future projects. He talked about filming in Iceland, his career path from law to acting, his parents' initial concerns, acting in graphic scenes in *Oz*, and the challenges of filming intense material.  The conversation branched out to the challenges of sex scenes in movies, Nigerian email scams, the rarity of actors appearing in multiple syndicated shows, and a comparison of British and American judicial systems, focusing on the use of wigs.  The segment concluded with Burr and Akinnuoye-Agbaje promoting their upcoming projects.

The final segment focused on childhood memories of promotional items from children's television shows.  E-Rock shared his bitterness over never receiving a promised talking pen from Bill Cosby's "Picture Pages," leading to discussions of other promotional items like "Sweet Pickles."  Jim Norton briefly joined the studio.  Listeners called in with their own stories of disappointing promotional items.  A caller, "Lady Di," recounted her disruptive behavior at Jim Norton's comedy show, leading to extended banter between her and the hosts about her actions, Twitter use, and job applications.  Craig Schenkel joined for a game of "Craig's Conundrums," with Lady Di participating, before the show concluded.  The segment also included frequent vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flesh it.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes!  Good morning, everybody.  Hey.  That's interesting.  Wow.  Very bassy. 
[00:02:00]  What?  The headphones?  Oh my god.  Yeah, they're totally different sounding.  I got, um...  I'm nice.  I'm too scared to try them.  They sound good.  You will not like the new bassy sound that you get out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my god.  I sound like a...  A man.  I sound like a baritone through these.  Nice.  What up?  Mars doesn't like him.  Mars doesn't like him?  Is that because you don't like Dr. Dre?  To bassy?  I want to hear what music sounds like.  You can count on that.  Oh my god. 
[00:02:30]  Count bassy?  Get it?  No.  I just put mine in.  Right?  You hear that?  Oh yeah, we can't use these.  They might be great for music, but...  I wish they could hear how these sound to us.  I know.  It's, uh...  You don't like them, Mars?  No.  Not at all.  And they're really heavy, too.  Yeah.  They're too heavy for broadcasting...  What?  Snowpink.  You mean like heavy?  Heavy man?  Yo, heavy?  Yo.  What's that?  They're really good for music. 
[00:03:00]  I feel like a man when I hear my voice in these.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  You're not.  Slow down.  Exactly.  Entertainment Weekly still says you sound like a piece of shit.  We gotta pass these out to our listeners.  Yeah.  We'll just have every listener can wear these so we sound like fucking amazing broadcasters.  Is Entertainment Weekly off the air yet?  It should be, but they're not.  There's pretty much no buzz on that channel.  No, of course not.  They watch...  Not a single buzz.  In our call screen room, they can see the studio.  Right.  Yeah.  And so they look through the window and watch their phones not ring all morning. 
[00:03:30]  All morning.  Oh my God.  That's terrible.  There you go.  They're in our spot.  What?  I'm listening to some music on them.  Yeah.  It's good.  Really good.  The music's really good.  Really good.  They're made from music.  Really good.  Natural spoken word for some reason.  I don't know.  It sounds different.  But I'm listening to Motorhead on these things.  Oh boy.  They're fucking awesome.  Yeah.  People love beats.  They walk around with them in the city.  Like the brothers will walk around without them even plugged into anything.  Oh yeah.  It's a fashion accessory. 
[00:04:00]  Like a fashion statement.  Well I'm going to do that.  And they'll just walk around like that until you know somebody else wants them and then  they'll fucking jack them for it.  And then they'll walk around with them around their neck.  It's a comfortable fashion statement.  I got to hip things up.  I'm going to start doing that.  You're just going to walk around with them around your neck?  How many days will I last out there?  Isn't that weird?  You won't let you out of the building.  Someone from Shade will take it.  You walk around like a stethoscope.  Like doctors walk around with stethoscopes around their neck?  Yeah I've seen them.  And Dr. Dre, you walk around with these around your neck. 
[00:04:30]  Nice.  See the whole tie in there?  Then what?  Then you're just a little hipper right?  You're hip.  People will look at you when you walk down the street and go, that guy's cool.  Alright and then I just take care of my mushroom haircut and I'll be good.  Yeah.  You will get robbed though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You will get jacked for him.  You're an easy mark.  On the train you think I'll get robbed for these?  Oh yeah.  Oh you are an easy mark.  You just look like a victim.  Yeah because you kind of look crazy but.  No I don't.  I'm a sweet boy.  They all want to pinch my cheeks.  But you don't have something blatantly out that they want. 
[00:05:00]  That's true.  Maybe the phone sometimes.  But if you get beats around your neck, they'll beat you for them.  That's why they call them beats.  They'll just beat you for them.  Mars, what are you trying to say over there buddy?  Listen to hip hop in these.  Amazing.  Oh yeah?  Listen to classical in these.  You'll see the fucking difference.  Why?  What do you mean?  All the frequencies are not there.  You don't hear them all.  You'll see.  Classical you don't like through these?  Yeah.  Listen to it.  But hip hop will be good right?  It'll be amazing.  But put Vivaldi on and shit.  Vivaldi?  When do you listen to Vivaldi? 
[00:05:30]  When I'm having dinner with the wife.  Do you listen to it?  You listen to fucking classical music?  Why do you wear headphones when you eat dinner with your wife?  No one said I was wearing headphones, stupid.  So I don't have to listen to it.  Vivaldi.  Oh shit, I lost this part.  Now I can't go back to my old headphones.  Thank you.  What?  Take a tip from Poppy.  Buy Poppy Bonds.  The high end don't sound so well.  Dude, I lost my...  Investment is something you need to do research on. 
[00:06:00]  So take a tip from Poppy.  Yeah, I lost your fucking tip.  What happened?  He lost his tip.  Oh, you lost your tip?  Wait, wait, what?  Oh shit.  Oh no.  You need a light Opie?  Yeah!  I don't know.  This just sounds fine to me.  Yeah, it sounds fine.  I don't know.  It sounds fine to me?  I don't know.  It's missing frequencies though?  Yeah, on the high ends.  The missing high end frequencies?  It wasn't on Motorhead.  Yeah.  They sounded really, really good, the music. 
[00:06:30]  Okay.  Now I have to...  Now I get some of this.  Alright.  Yeah, yeah.  Alright.  I'm digging this.  Yeah.  Hold on.  If somebody finds out you're listening to this on your beats, you'll really get robbed. 
[00:07:00]  Oh yeah, they'll be like, why are you wasting them beats on this shit, bro?  Imagine getting beat with the beats.  They're heavy.  Like they'll take them off your neck and then beat you with your own beats.  And then literally beat you for them by stealing them.  My neck hurts already from holding them up. 
[00:07:30]  Who wants my beats?  You get it off?  Yeah, I'm back to the old headphones.  I feel like I'm an African gentleman balancing something on my head.  It's very heavy.  I like them though.  I mean, they sound great.  Yeah.  But as far as for broadcasting, I don't know.  It's not working.  Maybe just for hanging out.  Hey, can we put these back in the original box?  I'm going to give these to somebody for Christmas.  We don't have a box.  Oh my God.  What?  What happened?  This would be a nice gift. 
[00:08:00]  For Christmas.  Slightly used.  They were used for five minutes.  I'm done with them.  The music sounds really good on them though.  It does.  Yeah.  I kind of like the...  I only wear half my headphones anyway.  I leave one on and one off like dumb Voss does.  Do you?  I can't be...  The way Voss wears, these are infuriating.  I can't be surrounded by my...  I don't know how you guys wear complete headphones when you're talking because I can't have...  I have to hear the outside noise.  Well, we're professional broadcasters. 
[00:08:30]  That's right.  We're trained.  I don't hear a lot of professional broadcasting a lot of times.  No.  I don't hear a lot of things that are professional.  Ah, that's better.  I hear a lot of...  Way better.  Fuck the Beats.  There's our review.  You have to give it up.  Next product.  Beats.  We'll start reviewing products.  Next product, please.  It's the fucking three to five minute review.  That's all we do.  We use it for fucking minimal amount of time and make our decision.  Well, it's very obvious.  You can't use this to listen to podcasts. 
[00:09:00]  It's a music thing.  It's not spoken word.  No.  Yeah.  Hell no.  Shave 4-5 uses them.  Do they?  Well, that makes sense.  There's just a lot of hip hop going on over there.  Yeah.  What do they do when they're talking?  They use them.  That's stupid.  Damn.  It's great.  Jay-Z finally got caught.  I told you.  I was onto this guy for a long fucking time.  What happened?  He's getting sued for his fucking sampling.  You know, these artists like to just take music and not pay for it. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  And make big hits out of someone else's music.  And he finally got hit with a lawsuit.  What happened?  Jay-Z faces lawsuit over Big Pimpin' Sample.  Yeah.  For Big Pimpin'.  Big Pimpin'.  And that's the one that got them?  Yep.  That one was made 13 years ago.  Fuck yeah.  What happened?  Well, they finally caught up to him and said, you can't do this.  But that's what they do.  I think it was a little known song he sampled, right?  But that's what they're saying.  And then the record company, which probably folded a long time ago, finally got wind of 
[00:10:00]  and said, wait a minute.  We can make some money off the Jay-Z ripping us off.  Damn.  Oh, that sounds good to me.  You guys are not hearing this like I am.  Oh, yeah?  I got blown by those.  What part did he sample in this song?  Probably that...  Oh, really?  That?  Probably.  But it's probably got one of those vanilla ice things on it.  Well, what's the original song? 
[00:10:30]  Let's match it up.  And he's great.  Why?  Oh, here you go.  Turn on my computer.  Yeah.  Stop!  It's the motherfucking Brave Mix! 
[00:11:00]  I hear it.  Oh, yeah.  That's the original?  Yeah.  It's going...  Yeah.  Well, the record company's not happy.  How old is Big Pimple?  13 years ago.  13 years, yeah.  He's getting sued for a 13-year-old song?  Yep.  Is he care of a statue of limitations?  Oh, I mean, he should have paid for the sample.  Yeah.  I mean, I would assume the guy that came up with the...  You know, that sample there. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  The original.  He'd have probably been cool with it.  I don't think so.  He probably is poor as shit.  And he sees Jay-Z.  I mean, if Jay-Z would have went to him,  he probably would have been cool with it.  Well, yeah.  He would have liked the little taste.  Right, right.  He wouldn't have held them up.  But now that Jay-Z took it without asking,  that's a problem.  Cost him some of that Jay-Z money.  Right.  Some of that...  Out of the fucking Beyoncé money.  I don't understand, you know,  why he's brilliant because he's using someone else's sample. 
[00:12:00]  I don't get it.  Way to make the beat.  This sounds fucking Arab.  It's Egyptian.  Yeah, that's what I said.  But this isn't the Jay-Z song.  This is the original, obviously.  Now go back to Jay-Z  and show the people how he used it.  Oh.  See?  He blackens it up.  And now he's got a big hit on his hands.  The beat is good, though.  Yeah, but it's not his.  When did the original come out?  A long time ago.  No, I mean the beat mixed with the original. 
[00:12:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why is that a talent?  You're taking someone else's fucking creation.  But nobody's saying...  And as we joke about on our show,  you know, you pump it up a little bit  and then you throw it out there like it's your own  because no one knows the original.  Are you asking about the beat or the song?  The whole thing.  The whole process seems...  Because he didn't make the beat,  so nobody's saying you made a great beat.  Right.  To Jay-Z.  Yeah, it's weird.  It's like covering a song in a weird way.  You know you have to do the same to cover a song.  Right.  It's still... 
[00:13:00]  It's a long-nosed line.  Like, look at Zeppelin.  I mean, how much of their stuff was covered...  Not many.  ...without telling anybody?  Not much.  Ooh.  Some big ones.  No, they're original artists.  Elvis?  Damn.  Elvis.  But Elvis just did other people's songs.  That's true.  They didn't try to, like, sneak it in there and...  Right.  ...you know, a piece of a song.  Yeah, but he did songs white people didn't know  are other people's songs.  It doesn't matter.  That's fine.  It's even worse.  Jay-Z's basically a billionaire.  It's worse.  Here's the problem.  Jay-Z's a billionaire,  and the guy he took the sample from 
[00:13:30]  is probably really poor,  if not dead.  It's the same thing Elvis did.  No.  No, not at all.  Elvis is like...  Elvis was the king.  I'll sing this song,  and it's a black man's song,  but I'm gonna sing it.  Exactly.  I'm a touching myself.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Except Elvis did it with people  who were in the country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Elvis did it with people  who, like, lived here.  Yeah.  In America.  Didn't the colonel toss the black guys  a few bucks for Elvis stealing them? 
[00:14:00]  No?  I wouldn't think so.  I thought the colonel was like...  It was accepted back then.  Thank you for your song, boy.  Here's a couple of dollars.  It was accepted back then.  My point is not accepted anymore.  Yeah.  I'm sure he picked for...  Jay-Z knew what he was doing.  He knew he was getting away  with a little something.  Yeah.  Because he picked some obscure song  and just assumed no one...  Thought he'd get away with it.  A, his fan base would have no idea  where the sample came from.  Mm-hmm.  I bet you if you asked a lot of them,  they would say,  yeah, Jay-Z came up with that, 
[00:14:30]  you know, Arabic-type sample.  Yeah.  When he did it.  I mean, people don't know  where...  Who's the original artist?  Let's look him up  and see how sad his life is.  To prove my point.  Oh, boy.  Has Jay-Z taken all his shit  out of Barney's yet?  No, he's still checking out  what the situation is over there.  Oh, yeah.  Not jumping to conclusions.  But it goes to our point.  Jay-Z didn't fold  Al Sharpton's bullshit.  Mm-hmm.  And we're not really talking  about Barney's as much already. 
[00:15:00]  No, it's gone.  That controversy is gone.  It goes away.  If you just hang in there,  it does go away.  Yep.  What corporations should  understand that?  So what's this guy's name?  Well, it just says it's  Bally Hamdi's uncle.  He looks like Robbie.  That's the artist  that it came from?  Yeah, it looks like  he died in 93.  Oh.  Destitute, right?  I don't know if he was destitute.  I bet you without  a fucking dollar to his name.  Mm. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he died in 93.  Jay-Z's like,  eh, he's not gonna  come back to get me.  Exactly, but the record label  was paying attention.  Oh.  He composed a lot of music.  He didn't seem destitute.  Yeah, he was destitute.  Who's buying that type of music?  Come on, Sam.  You're not that dumb.  He was in his native land.  Is it Indian music  or is it Egyptian?  Egyptian.  Egyptian music.  I don't think it sounds kind of Indian.  Yeah, besides like  Walk Like an Egyptian,  you know,  that whole Egyptian music scene  didn't really work.  Yeah, he created hit songs 
[00:16:00]  for many prominent Arabic singers  during the 60s and 70s.  Name one prominent Arabic singer.  Muhammad Atta.  It's a late 60s song.  Yeah, I know.  We weren't really up  on the Arabic music scene.  I haven't heard that.  More to my point.  Oh, love.  Walk Like a book.  Oh, love.  It does a good impression.  I can't do that.  Oh, I love screaming that.  Sometimes I just scream it  around my house  and laugh at myself.  I can't say it.  Hello, Walk Like a book.  Hello, Walk Like a book. 
[00:16:30]  Hello, hello.  They freak out when things happen.  I love watching those videos.  Tom is just crazy.  Hopefully you'll be in one.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo.  Yo.  So, like Jimmy said,  I think Led Zeppelin  stole a lot of their music too  early on.  Yeah, that's just not true.  Check it out.  No.  No.  I'm worried about it.  It's really not true.  He never stole anything.  I thought it was.  All right.  Nope.  It's Timberland's beat. 
[00:17:00]  It's not true.  What?  It's not Jay-Z's.  It's not Timberland's beat either.  He got the main part of the beat  from somebody else.  Boots.  Right, but it'd be him  that you'd say stole it.  He stole the other guy's music.  If anybody stole it,  it was Timbo.  Yeah, but Jay-Z overlooked  the whole thing  and probably should have said,  where'd you get that cool beat from?  And then the Timberland dude says,  well, I got from this dope  that's now dead,  so he's not going to come  and sue us.  And then Jay-Z probably  should have did the right thing  and said, well,  maybe we could pay his family at least. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Right?  I guess,  but there's a lot of musicians  that should have done that  a long time before Jay-Z.  Scott in New Jersey.  What's up, Bo?  What's up, buddy?  What about Jay-Z destroying  Nirvana Smells Like Teen Spirit  in that new stupid-ass song  you do with Justin Timberlake?  Oh, yeah?  Can we hear that?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I kind of like Nirvana.  Not as much as I used to, by the way,  if anyone cares.  No?  But I still like it. 
[00:18:00]  It's nostalgic now.  Yeah.  It's not so much rocking  as it is like,  oh, I remember the 90s.  I like Pearl Jam more than Nirvana,  and I like Alice in Chains  more than Nirvana.  Yeah, Pearl Jam's still keeping it,  you know, together,  current kind of thing.  STP, I still like more than...  I know.  STP!  Yeah!  Hello!  Hello!  Hello! 
[00:18:30]  That's gotta be my favorite one.  Hello!  Hello!  Oh, you laugh now,  but when I put that on  a fucking t-shirt,  watch out.  Oh, man.  Hello!  Why did you say hello like that?  Because it was...  because, you know,  there was something outrageous going on.  Oh, outrageous.  Oh, it wasn't...  You were talking to Curse Man.  Right.  Yeah, Curse Man was being outrageous,  so that was my way of going,  whoa!  Hey, look at...  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  Like, hey,  who invited you here?  Hello!  Oh, no, Curse Man. 
[00:19:00]  Let me go to Jim in Philly.  Curse Man, oh boy.  Jim, you can work out here.  Jim.  Led Zeppelin stole a lot of their music  from a band called Spirit.  Look at that.  What?  Yeah, that's just not true.  Never happened.  Nope.  No, look at that.  Prove it to me.  Never happened.  Nope.  What is that,  Rumor's in here say?  It's a lie.  It's Rumor in Indianville.  People are just trying to start shit today.  Check it out.  All right, thanks, Jim.  I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  I'll never believe it.  Zeppelin was always one of my top five bands. 
[00:19:30]  And we refuse to check it out here.  Oh, yeah.  Do you want to hear the Nirvana thing?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Soundtrack to shootings.  There's 20 different songs going on. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, I mean, he's brilliant for putting five songs into one.  He's trying to get that whole fucking New York thing going.  Right there.  He's trying.  Like, this is a successful song.  You're a little out of touch on this one.  Terrible.  Who's the broad that has the beautiful voice?  That's Justin Timberlake. 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  Wow.  You don't want to talk about Mysterious.  Oh, that's funny.  You want to talk about Mysterious.  Who's the girl with the beautiful voice?  Oh, that's fucking great.  Play it again.  JT.  I'm the only one that hears girl there.  I totally do.  Thank you.  But you're not the only one that's made the mistake.  Here's to you. 
[00:21:00]  That's lovely.  That's broad.  It is Angelic.  Is that Enya?  That's beautiful.  Maybe Alicia Keys?  Is that Alicia?  That's Justin.  Oh.  So then it should be his song.  He's on the hook.  Like, this is not...  The one with the really nice voice should get the credit for the song.  Not the...  Yeah, yeah.  That's stupid. 
[00:21:30]  And then all of a sudden, the voice of an angel comes in and they get no fucking credit.  He gets credit.  Terrible.  It says Jay-Z with Justin Timberlake.  He gets full credit.  It should be Justin Timberlake with someone really just fucking making it nonsense.  Like, and singing all off-key to some fucking song from the 90s.  Too cool to even try.  Just...  Here we go, man.  And the time's up. 
[00:22:00]  And he mentioned...  Don't pick that.  And then this, like, fucking angel kicks in.  It's Justin Timberlake.  That's a bit mysterious.  Angelic voice.  Right.  Justine Timberlake.  That New York song would be way better without all that fucking...  They did it without him.  They did it without him.  Oh, yeah.  They did it without him.  Brooklyn, Staten Island, downtown, uptown, all the way around the town.  She did it by herself.  It wasn't as big.  And the girl that sings in that song should do it by herself, too.  Not as many people liked it.  Exactly.  She did.  What?  Alicia Keys did the song with this chick. 
[00:22:30]  No, I don't believe it.  That's Justin Timberlake.  It's a boy for me to think.  You know what?  Have all your fun with what I said, but I stand by it.  That chick.  That chick.  All right?  That chick's got it.  We still don't have the Jay-Z story in front of any of the other paper.  It's the articles in the paper.  Oh, it is.  Oh, God.  And he said Kurt Cobain's name right before he did the lyric.  He's not...  It doesn't matter if you say that...  He's not saying that he made up the lyric.  I understand, but he destroys it. 
[00:23:00]  No, why?  There's no destroy.  It still exists.  No, it sounds like shit the way he's singing that.  No, why?  Because he knows Courtney Love is paying close attention.  And he doesn't want to deal with that shit.  Oh, yeah.  So he figures, well, at least if I acknowledge Kurt, maybe she'll leave me the fuck alone.  I can't fucking...  And I guarantee he paid.  That one he paid.  Most of them I'm sure he's paid for.  He should pay for all of them.  If this is a thing going on, which I know, I'm not that dumb,  in hip-hop, these guys should be paying. 
[00:23:30]  They shouldn't be sneaking those obscure ones out there  and hoping no one notices from the family or the artists themselves.  They've been doing it forever.  Vanilla Ice tried to do it from a Queen song.  No, that was different.  If I may give him a little time here,  the song originally went...  Right.  And his went...  So, you know...  I stand corrected.  Right.  Sure.  Jay-Z may run this town, 
[00:24:00]  but a Manhattan record label wants to drag him into court.  Tough T-U-F America, Inc.  Sock the Brooklyn rapper and his record companies  with a copyright infringement lawsuit.  Wednesday claiming he illegally sampled a funky late 1960s jam  without permission to jazz up the hit Run This Town.  And the miffed label argues Jay-Z should face the music  because it owns the exclusive rights to The Hook and Sling,  a 1969 number by Eddie Bowe. 
[00:24:30]  Run This Town, which also features Rihanna and Kanye West...  Oh, of course.  ...samples The Hook and Sling dozens of times,  the federal suit alleges.  So there you go.  Let me look it up.  That's a different song.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear different stories.  What?  Whoa.  Let's hear Run This Town.  He's a multiple offender.  You play Run This Town.  There he's got his beat sign in there.  The Ruck's wearing beats. 
[00:25:00]  That's...  That's...  That's Rihanna.  She's on the mug.  She's got...  She gets full credit.  Wait, pause.  Wait, that whole thing we just did  had nothing to do with the lawsuit in the paper today?  I said that was a different lawsuit.  What's that lawsuit for?  That's a lawsuit over Big Pimp,  and it's the same principle.  So he's...  Good.  I'm glad these guys are going after Jay-Z.  How many times are he being sued?  I guess this would be two that we're aware of.  All right.  So this is...  Coldplay got sued for stealing music,  and you guys are all about...  Did they? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Coldplay.  What'd they steal?  What's his name?  Satriani or something?  Joe Satriani.  They stole the whole song.  Really?  No, they didn't.  I don't agree.  Not at all.  They stole Viva La Vida from him.  Oh, come on.  Oh, man.  Coldplay has come up with one song in their entire careers,  and they just rework it every single time.  They stole that shit from themselves.  Exactly.  It's one long fucking song their entire career.  I used to like Coldplay a little bit  when I wanted to get a little emotional. 
[00:26:00]  I'm glad you're opening up today.  When I was missing someone,  I would put on Coldplay to make it hurt a little more.  You would?  You'd get into the words?  Yeah.  Yellow?  He's red.  Yellow was one of them.  How'd that go?  I don't know.  Oh, gosh.  That is one to play when you're missing somebody.  Oh, is it?  Oh, yeah.  The stars were shining.  Yeah.  The car, they shine for you.  It was the girl you were missing, wasn't it?  Absolutely.  She had to go home for a little while, 
[00:26:30]  and I would put this on to make it hurt.  He's scruddling.  Yellow.  Yellow.  I don't know this one.  This is good.  This is an amazing song.  I love it.  He doesn't sing it in concert anymore  because it's for an old broad.  Is that right?  I think he finally started singing it again.  What does Yellow have to do with anything?  Well, let's...  Oh, he was into water sports.  Yellow. 
[00:27:00]  Or the girl.  Oh.  Or he was a coward.  All right, now listen to the great Coldplay.  Why don't we explain the Yellow thing first for the people?  He wrote it for an old girlfriend,  and then he gets with the Gwyneth,  so she's basically like,  hey, fucker, stop singing that Yellow song.  That's for somebody else.  What?  This is my interpretation of what happened.  What's behind closed doors?  Hey, fucker, quit singing Yellow.  Right.  And so then, you know,  all the fans who love Yellow,  and they don't give a fuck who the song was written for,  they're all bummed out in concert  because he doesn't do the song. 
[00:27:30]  To them, it was written for them.  But I don't know what the update is.  I think he is singing that song again in concert.  That's some Radiohead bullshit.  Why do you not play your big hit?  Yep.  Cludge, yeah.  Because the chick got in the way.  Gwyneth is like, fuck no.  Paltrow?  Yeah.  Well, did he tell her to fucking not, like,  play any of her old movies?  To have them stop any love scene that she has?  In a movie?  You fucking bitch.  All right, let's hear the Coldplay versus Joe Satchelan,  which is complete and utter bullshit. 
[00:28:00]  Or as Sam put it, some Satriani guy.  Right.  Someone called you a douchebag.  For not knowing Joe Satriani?  Yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  For being under 40.  Yes, they did, Sam.  Yes, they did.  He used to say under 30.  It pains me.  It pains me to agree with Sam, but I'm with him on this one.  I don't give a shit about Satriani.  It was, oh man, I'm going to get killed for this one.  It was so fucking overrated.  Great.  Great.  You can play your instrument.  Who gives a fuck?  I don't like him.  You didn't like him either, right? 
[00:28:30]  Because when we, Steve did a bit with one of our old N.E.W. bits that had my,  a Jim Norton bit.  So I wanted to put it on one of my CDs.  We needed permission from Satriani.  It was like a who gives a shit thing, and he wouldn't grant permission,  so we had to change the bit.  So I've always, I've hated him for 15 years for that.  Oh, fuck him.  And maybe he was right to make that decision, but.  I interviewed him back in the day.  He's actually a nice guy, but.  Eh, so fuck him.  I just never got into Satriani thing.  I don't know him at all.  I say fuck him. 
[00:29:00]  All those guys, the Yngwie.  Yngwie Mounds.  All those guys that really just rip it up and down the fucking.  Fucking your mom.  Guitar.  I just wasn't into that.  Enough of that shit.  What was the Cliffs of Dover song?  That was kind of good, though.  Who did that one?  That was all right.  Eric.  Eric, yeah.  It was Eric somebody, right?  Eric Nagel.  Eric Johnson.  Eric Johnson.  That one I didn't mind as much, I guess, but.  In general, I'm not into that shit.  Yeah, that was kind of a nice fucking up-tempo number.  All right, let's go. 
[00:29:30]  Coldplay versus Joe Satriani.  All right.  I'm going to have an open mind here.  Me too.  All right.  This is Coldplay.  I know, Coldplay.  Okay, man.  I've heard this one.  Okay.  Keep going.  Okay, next.  Oh.  Same fucking song. 
[00:30:00]  I don't really hear it.  What the fuck are you talking about?  It's totally different.  I don't really hear it.  It's the same song.  That's completely different.  And you know why this is different?  Why?  Why?  Because in hip-hop, sampling is a real thing.  Right.  This is just guys playing their instruments like other guys playing their instruments.  Oh, man.  You probably say me try too hard.  I don't really hear it at all.  I'm not trying hard at all.  All right, go to the Coldplay.  You can go to the Coldplay.  Dead, too.  I don't hear the sound of it. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  There's nothing there.  But I hear it.  Yeah.  But I don't like Satriani.  Okay.  Yep.  All right.  You hear that?  I absolutely hear this.  I've heard this song a million times.  You hear that?  Yep.  It's nice.  Mm-hmm.  Now Joe Satriani.  Okay.  No. 
[00:31:00]  Satriani just wanted to get his name.  Did he win his lawsuit or no?  Of course not.  Satriani lost.  It's the same song.  He lost.  He should have lost that.  Yeah.  I don't think that's the same song.  Here's another one from Coldplay.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Yeah.  This is from a German band.  Craftwork.  I know a little craftwork.  No, you know Coldplay.  This is Coldplay.  I know.  God, I'm going to have to break out some Coldplay songs.  That's creepy.  I went through a Coldplay phase. 
[00:31:30]  And thanks to Oedipus.  Front Row in Boston for the show back in the day when we were off the air.  Sounds very Coldplay-ish.  It is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  All right.  Now what happens?  Now let's get into some craftwork.  No.  What?  They're using like a Casio and stuff.  It's very different.  Da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  Oh, man.  Is that the exact same riff?  No.  No?  Nope. 
[00:32:00]  There's nothing there.  Okay.  Ah, ja.  And there's a ja in there?  No.  Ja.  No, of course not.  Das chicken fucking ist gut.  Ja.  Well, I guess if it was that nonsense music that the kids are listening to, it'd be more  of a problem.  Well, let's go back to Jay-Z.  So now, you thought we...  See, you know he's a rip-off artist.  I know he samples.  There's no secret.  When we brought this shit up, you brought up one that we weren't even talking about today.  Nobody's ever said he doesn't sample.  It's a newer song.  What's the Jay-Z song now?  Run This Town.  That is 2009.  All right.  Run This Town is in the paper today, and he's sampling this poor dude from 1969. 
[00:32:30]  I guarantee that's either dead or really poor.  It's such a rip-off.  We're going to run this town.  Run it inside out.  I've heard it.  We're going to run...  What?  It's not the same.  No.  It's that one?  No.  Yeah, it's a rip-off.  Sorry about this.  Tom in Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, you guys...  When you guys were on K-Rock and XM, you guys talked about Coldplay stealing Tatryon and  stuff.  No, I don't think so.  What?  I don't remember that.  No.  I'm pretty sure he's right. 
[00:33:00]  Nope.  He's just trying to chime in on the chat.  Yeah, yeah.  Trying to be a part of this big conversation, this best-of conversation.  We don't remember that.  Yeah, we just went through it.  It's obvious that there's no rip-off thing happening.  Maybe you guys need to put the beats back on or something.  What?  So, uh...  I was saying we're sampling our own show.  I do know of a bigger song, a GNR song.  Oh, a bigger song.  Yes.  Wow, I thought you meant Jay-Z again.  No, no.  A bigger song.  Wow.  That was taken by, uh, Guns N' Roses.  A little bit of a beat was pulled from a Black Sabbath beat. 
[00:33:30]  Whoa!  A little paradise.  How would you know?  Well, I like Black Sabbath.  Oh.  Well, let's get the...  Never stated that.  No, only Jay-Z does this illegally.  This is crazy.  Well, he's not paying the people.  And he's getting big hits out of these samples.  He's not responsible for looking at the paperwork behind the beats that are given to you.  No one's responsible in this day and age.  No one's responsible in this day and age.  He runs his own shit.  Somewhere in the conversation, he goes, well, that's a cool little fucking sample there.  Where'd you get that from?  Yo, where'd you get that shit, yo?  Are the people dead? 
[00:34:00]  Because I don't feel like paying them.  Right.  Is that what happens?  Yes.  So let's hear Run This Town by Jay-Z.  Is it a newer song?  It's from 2009.  Okay, so it's a few years old.  And it's with Rihanna, Kanye West, and this poor dude.  No one ever works alone anymore.  Eddie Bowe.  Gotta get the featuring bullshit.  Bullshit.  Why are you mad about featuring now?  Oh, because it's everyone's featuring someone.  Just do it yourself.  Right.  If he was that good, he wouldn't need features.  He does such by himself all the time.  No, he doesn't.  You never saw ABBA featuring the Go-Go's. 
[00:34:30]  No, you didn't.  No.  And the is a big one.  And the.  The Diana Ross and the Supremes.  So a lot of times featuring.  But they were their band.  That was like your back.  Tony Orlando and Dawn.  That was like your backup people.  That's backup shit.  And it was every time.  We got Johnny Cash with June Carter Cash.  Well, they were fucking married.  They were fucking married.  He had no choice.  He had to hear that shit in the bedroom.  And he finally said,  All right.  We'll do a couple songs together.  I'll put you on the record.  Right.  So let's play Run This Town by Jay-Z as a reference point. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I know this.  She's good, man.  I always thought this was a Rihanna song.  Of course you did.  It should be.  It should be.  Is this JT again?  No.  It's Rihanna.  Oh, I got it.  It's Angelic.  All black, everything.  Black cars, black cars, all black, everything.  Oh, enough with the black.  When does the song get good again? 
[00:35:30]  I think I liked you guys better when you pretended to be young.  And then she comes in with that beautiful voice.  He was really feeling good about himself this day.  Because this rap is really long.  Justin's got a great voice.  That's Rihanna.  What?  Yeah, that one's Rihanna.  Oh, man.  How disgusting would hip-hop be if she started dating me?  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:00]  That would be great.  Wouldn't that be great?  Hip-hop's just like, what the fuck?  And that picture of me in my underwear getting surfaced.  She's just Instagramming sexy shots of her,  and you're in the bed in the background.  Just looking.  We're putting pictures of her and her new man,  and I always look like I always do.  Like, my neck's a little fat.  I'm like Uncle Fester.  She's doing a big, toothy smile.  Oh, the community would be so angry.  More importantly, this song is a Rihanna song.  And then the lyrics in the song say, 
[00:36:30]  it says, life's a game, but it's not fair.  I break the rules, so I don't care.  Well, look out.  And he did break the rules making this song.  Uh-oh.  Where's the hook, by the way, that he sampled?  I don't even know.  It's probably in the beat, I'm assuming.  I haven't heard the song.  All right, so now he got the sample from this guy, Eddie Bowe,  from a 1969 number.  So let's hear the original now.  This is hook and sling.  Yeah!  Go!  One, two.  One, two, three, four.  I've heard that in other songs. 
[00:37:00]  That one, two, one, two, three, four is a ripoff.  The name of this thing is hook and sling.  I totally hear it.  What are you talking about?  I totally hear it.  This sounds like express yourself.  Right.  Yeah, but it doesn't sound like the song we just heard a minute ago.  It's like identical.  You think so?  Wow, that's a fucking loop.  Express yourself, right?  You hear it, right? 
[00:37:30]  Totally ripping them off.  Totally ripping them off.  I've run this town.  Yes.  This is some fucking urban shit right here.  This is some Afro shit.  This is shit like Ronnie B probably loves this.  You think this would open the Ronnie B show?  They would open the show with this.  And they'd be like, ah, that was great, Def.  I like it.  Whatever happened to Eddie Bowe while Jay-Z is like taking baths with hundreds? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, man.  I mean, maybe they took the drums out of it or something.  No, it's exact.  You can't even tell the difference.  I mean, you can't even tell that there is a difference.  Right.  How did Eddie Bowe die?  He died in some horrific, poor way.  Broke.  He died in 2009 at the age of 78.  2009.  See?  Right.  Because the Jay-Z song came out and he couldn't take it anymore.  He just fucking...  Or Jay-Z was just waiting.  He was sitting on the song.  He does.  Jay-Z keeps tabs on these people. 
[00:38:30]  When they die, he just comes in like a vulture.  How did he live at the end of his life?  I think he was under a fucking train boxcar.  I'm sure.  Cooking beans in the can.  I mean, he was still putting out music, so...  What?  He was still putting out music in 2008, so...  That's crazy.  He's probably doing just fine.  No, he wasn't doing just fine.  He didn't have enough money to retire, so this poor fuck had to keep trying.  Maybe he liked music.  And then Jay-Z, you know, does an exact fucking rip-off of the song and makes millions off it. 
[00:39:00]  But, okay, when Katrina hit, it destroyed Bowe's home and recording studio.  Oh, man.  While he was on tour in Paris.  Fucking Bush hates black people.  He was on tour in Paris while Katrina was here.  He's the president.  That's Bush.  Oh.  He didn't die.  Did Jay-Z rebuild his little tiny house?  Ah.  No.  Is it a hovel?  Yeah.  It's a hovel.  What parish did he live in?  But he was doing fine.  He was on tour in Paris.  In the 2000s. 
[00:39:30]  Okay, Paris.  That's right.  Wow.  Let me say hi to Ellis in Philly.  Ellis, I know you.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Oh, of course.  Another...  Speck and Z-Tack?  Of course.  Every time.  Another blatant rip-off is Godsmack Keep Away.  And they ripped off a filter.  Hey, man.  Nice shot.  Oh, that's impossible.  Who did this?  Godsmack?  Godsmack.  Just don't just keep away.  Right.  Stop lying. 
[00:40:00]  And they ripped off a filter.  Hey, man.  Nice shot.  Hans.  Maybe Poopy.  Poopy stole it.  Yeah.  Poopy.  Ellis.  Well, we'll have to check that out some other day.  Thanks, Ellis.  Wow.  I mean, this record company, they want Run This Way to be just wiped from the records.  This song's called Run This Town.  What did I say?  Run This Way?  Run This Town.  They want it wiped from the records.  Walk This Way? 
[00:40:30]  They are fucking pissed.  It was happening in 2009.  What are they pissed now for?  They finally figured it out.  It was a huge song.  Well, you know.  It takes time.  These brothers are ripping off everything.  Yep.  Jesus.  That's how I hear it.  I just played a whole bunch of white people stealing music.  White people invented stealing music.  It's not true.  Nope.  It's not.  No, I didn't hear it in the Coldplay century or anything.  It was 100% there.  It was not even close.  I don't tell you white people don't steal music, but I didn't hear it there.  It was there.  No, it wasn't.  It was the same song. 
[00:41:00]  Nope.  And then they stole the other song from the German band.  I gave you an example of white people stealing music and you didn't play it.  Coldplay didn't go...  You're mad about the Sabbath thing, still.  I'm not mad about it.  It is what it is.  And Coldplay didn't do...  So what are you talking about?  Yah, yah, yah.  Yah, yah, yah.  Something like that?  Can we play some Rammstein?  I think it's one of my favorites.  Rammstein.  Give me some Rammstein.  That was some good fucking shit.  When the lyrics kick in, I have no fucking idea what he's singing about, but I have a  feeling it's not good. 
[00:41:30]  I just picked your fucking goose-stepping troops through Nuremberg.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  This just sends Jews scattering.  They just run away from this music.  I want to rock through Crown Heights with this shit.  It's just crazy.  In a fucking convertible.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  This just sends Jews scattering.  They just run away from this music.  Yah.  I want to rock through Crown Heights with this shit.  It's just crazy.  In a fucking convertible.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah. 
[00:42:00]  This song makes you anti-semitic.  It really does.  It really does.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Maybe they are in charge of a little too much.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah. 
[00:42:30]  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  Yah.  tattoo this fucking rocks you see this you know what this means not welcome this is hateful music  get me a goddamn razor i'm shaving my head right now yeah here we go 
[00:43:00]  not on my watch i'll cut off your fucking shylock nose  yeah you know what he's saying nine two nine nine nine yeah this is good crystal knock  nine man nine yeah oh let me get this nice little little casio thing yeah that's the 
[00:43:30]  fucking that's the cheery nazi uh soldier playing it as the others are clearing out the ghetto oh  yeah he's trying to keep things upbeat he's a one-man band yeah  what does it mean do i think it's you hate me 
[00:44:00]  oh boy okay that you know what that means you know they're singing to the rest of the world  oh yeah it doesn't help uh with this riff you hate me and then  to be aggressive about it you can just picture goose stepping right troops right  fucking stuka bombers just diving on poland yeah  you know that song uh bittersweet symphony by the verve yeah you know they lost all their money 
[00:44:30]  from that song sal just told me what happened let me just told them they were they got  fucked well tell me what do you mean they got fucked hey some people say they ripped  off the entire fucking song tell me if this sounds familiar at all this is a rolling stone song right  it's a rolling stone song okay that's a little 
[00:45:00]  where'd the stones take this from some black guy i'm sure  they took it from the verve it was probably like a little known band called the verve  and then they turn it into you know beautiful music 
[00:45:30]  sounds a little better than playing with rubber bands on a cigar box  in some fucking creek down in alabama  the stones did a service to music exactly by stealing the black who wants to listen to any  of that shit on an old busted up guitar oh my god sitting out in a rocking chair next to a swamp  fuck let's listen to some muddy waters man that's very nice let's do some muddy waters today you're  not mad you're not mad at the verve i don't believe it you just heard that so that's a rolling  stone song it's the same song they lost all their money yeah they had to give it to the rolling 
[00:46:00]  stones yes oh they did i didn't know that it's like why the rolling stones couldn't look the other  way they ain't got enough cash really why would they look the other way they're all billionaires  but it's you can't look the other way it's the same song no not really the verve really stole  that one like really really oh yeah why didn't they oh they might as well just played the record  why didn't they just still paint it black you're falling for this right what this is the verve they 
[00:46:30]  just put the rolling stones fucking uh picture up on the youtube oh man they did rip it off i gotta  be honest no no this is the verb yeah the verb  do you think it's one guy in the band that said hey i came up with a good  fucking hug and then everyone else in the band goes you motherfucker you fucked us  or you think they all know that they ripped off  what's the stones again play the stones song again 
[00:47:00]  what a great  like at this point the verb might as well just tour his djs  wow that's a great it is i never knew that they oh uh dr gay has a little  fucking the big verb defender yeah how does pearl jam fit into this they're just better than the  verb ah yeah uh yeah in the lawsuit they ended up having to give all songwriting credit and all 
[00:47:30]  royalties to mick jagger and keith richards wow man they kind of got like ray uh what was the guy  from ghostbusters parker jr and huey lewis yeah same deal that's good though you can't just go taking  people's shit well it it's a weird story um that's why jay-z's gonna get fucked he'll settle yeah  and he's done a a a hundred songs yeah sampling the verb had one hit i think it's harder when  a smaller guy sues a big guy when the smaller guy the big guy offers to settle the smaller guy is 
[00:48:00]  much more likely to take the settlement whereas huey lewis and the stones don't have to take the  settlement and run this town was not a direct ripoff of that song we heard a minute i don't know  it's not exact to me well they asked for permission boy the verb is stupid here's what happened what  happened the the uh the song that they that they sampled or or that they they asked the verb yeah  was was the andrew oldham orchestra's recording of the rolling stones song the last time that's  crazy oh that's the worst time the andrew oldham orchestra was a side project of andrew oldham who 
[00:48:30]  was the original manager and producer for the rolling stones okay it was just orchestra music of the  rolling stones he had all the rights to their music so the verb obtained a license to use the  sample and they agreed on a 50 50 split okay but the rolling stones successfully argued that the verb  had used too much of the sample oh and they asked because it's not a sample it's all exactly it's not  the sample it's the whole song so they asked for 100 of the songwriting credit and royalties 
[00:49:00]  and the verb so did the verb do you think used more than they implied they were going to use it's  the whole song yeah it's not a sample it's it's throughout the entire they made it a huge hit  yeah rolling stones if you make it if you make it a huge hit then that's different even for jay-z no  not i'm not allowing it as far as jay-z goes yeah sorry i figured even though they wrote all the lyrics  now even the lyric even the lyric credits credits have to go to mcjacken that's just like a  punishment that is like punitive damages let me hear last time by the stones with not the orchestra 
[00:49:30]  version yeah because i don't i don't hear last time in the orchestra version of last time do you  it might just be an intro might just be some fucking intro  how does that become  how does that become bittersweet symphony  anyone else hear it i don't well they sound like the stones 
[00:50:00]  the melody sounds the same if you listen to the way he's singing the lyrics  yeah right right but they didn't ask they didn't ask to sample this song they asked to sample the  orchestra version and then they took the melody too yeah i'm sure basically they sampled way too  much of the song i'm sure that song even started out like that sounds awesome that's 
[00:50:30]  fucking that sounds awesome some guy playing a fucking old coke bottle and a fucking cat gut but  i would listen to that in a rocky chair with a fucking washboard oh yeah yeah yeah you don't  like that no i hate when the purists go back to the first version of the song let's go to uh  chris in new jersey chris hey what's up chris hey buddy uh i think i'm going to set off an argument 
[00:51:00]  between uh opie and jenny the why the solo in carl james alive is a direct ripoff from kiss  is she well i have to let me hear it first wait which song what song kisses she and what alive  well let me hear kiss uh she it's a good song this one i never heard of before what's the kiss song  she oh it's going yeah let's hear if it's pearl jams alive 
[00:51:30]  mm-hmm 1975 yep that's it yeah what do you say in the guitar solo  okay so there's so how far  sounds like sammy hagar's song right there right  where's the solo after the first uh chorus i guess fast times it reached my high 
[00:52:00]  burning burning burning have been a ball that's what it sounds like i saw ace freely play black  diamond with it's fray lay hey pronounce it right right ace fra hala hey we didn't get to the the  right the guitar shut up the solo and alive no the soul what solo and she the solo and she you said  right chris yeah yeah so we gotta move forward a little bit let them sing a bit and then they're  i'm gonna go into that solo crap 
[00:52:30]  i've heard this song in years yeah  i've got the strange fascination  the power for some chick down the hall that's what it is 
[00:53:00]  everything's a rip-off  this stinks on ice oh i like this oh  yeah and i'm not even a big kiss fan it's good though  mm-hmm is the solo coming up chris  this was a bubblegum band no 
[00:53:30]  a little bubblegum no i never chewed gum  now let's think to them  turn down  what happens  where's ace for how well you're really  awesome  all right all right is this it oh no you have to go away oh is this it chris  god he's dragged out  fucking bullshit songs come on now 
[00:54:00]  it's a four-minute song  i will not hear this  sparrows for the kiss  please kiss  dumb little makeup gimmick hey hey hey  i don't like your analysis  oh here we go  i have to get a pro jam  you hear it chris i don't know 
[00:54:30]  i hear it a little yeah  you hear it a little yeah  it's an homage  all right now  now is that it chris  yeah that was it yeah okay thank you man  i don't know finally  let me hear a pearl jam  or go to pearl jam  you know you know this song  we might have let this listen to the song  oh  right  no  can we hear sirens today yeah sirens  who can tell exactly this is crazy i'll be able to i'm very good at this 
[00:55:00]  i was voted most likely to pick out a ripoff  here we go  i mean i hear similarity but yeah it's a guitar  it makes me parallel thinking that guy was an  asshole i mean when it comes to guitar solos  there's only so much you can do with a guitar  only six strings on the goddamn thing  i love the dope  i don't really hear it  i don't either this just sounds like another lead 
[00:55:30]  sounds like a great song another obligatory guitar lead  i don't really hear it either honestly i'd love to hear it too  but jay-z man  fuck  yeah he's a ripoff i think your argument's been debunked quite frankly  um man  can we hear muddy waters  bunked it  just to piss off at  give me some muddy waters  it's a bunch of bunk from the beginning  let's do like a song about a bus or something from muddy waters  oh great  let's do bus 
[00:56:00]  not you don't put song about a bus in there  there's one called bus driver from hard again  it's about uh  jackson this will drive anthony nuts  here we go  i love hard again the album  oh that's great  this is everything you hate right here  oh that's good  playing it with an old chair leg and some hound dog fur  they fashioned into a guitar 
[00:56:30]  oh shut up  it's muddy waters  it's terrible  yeah but  they they came up with that  and every band does the blues riff  repeat the first line  there you go  and now now change it up of one one  there you go and then say something else  and then the lord says something 
[00:57:00]  well my baby she's a fucking asshole  of course  now is he going to repeat it again  he might repeat it he might  repeat that line let me hear  of course  wow how original  oh 
[00:57:30]  all right  is the imus going to break  the blues  what  yeah that's imus break music  oh let me say hi to don in alaska  we got a lot of fans in alaska  how heavy is alaska to wear  oof  hey that uh  song that you guys uh were playing earlier  yeah  on that same cd they at the very end of the cd they play it in english  and it i swear to god it sounds like the gayest song ever 
[00:58:00]  oh my god i don't think i've ever heard this english version  maybe we have  in english it sounds retarded  you've heard this yeah  by gay he means happy  this is a rip off of rammstein  yeah it sounds just like it  so they decided to try to get some english fans  but they don't need to  they sound way better in german  yeah  darn darn darn darn  fuck  god i love that 
[00:58:30]  it really is one of the best  why are they kissing in this video  they love it  it's not really a romantic song  oh  you hate  you hate me  what  oh i don't like it already  you  you hate  you hate me  why don't you complain about it  yeah really  you  you hate  you hate me  oh my god this is not the same  no 
[00:59:00]  this sucks  that german  fucking language is very uh  you hate me  very abrasive  of course we do listen to this song  i imagine every song has this riff by this band  they don't stray too far from this riff  no  right  that's a good one  all right  you get it you hate me  i don't think i've ever heard this in all these years 
[00:59:30]  you hate me to say  you hate me to say  you hate me to say  and i did not obey  will you until this  must ever  be a right to her forever  never  never  never  never  no  never  mind  it's not bad though  i mean  it's hard to literally translate a song  i know there's a drop off 
[01:00:00]  yeah that original is amazing  i don't even give a fuck  i don't know what they're saying  i have another song with uh  yeah do you  What's that?  All their songs have these heavy riffs.  Yeah, give me another...  Oh, I know this song.  Yeah.  It's called Buy a Hat at Market.  Oh.  I like that one.  Buy a hat.  Buy a hat at. 
[01:00:30]  Buy a hat at the market.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  There you go.  We got a lot done here today.  We did.  Jay-Z's a big time...  We found out Jay-Z's a thief.  Big time thief.  Have you ever watched their performance of this?  What?  Like, just at a show?  No.  They put on great shows.  Why is the keyboard player on a fucking treadmill?  He's the fucking man. 
[01:01:00]  He's just walking.  That shit rocks.  That's so he can march.  For a long time, they didn't play in the U.S.  simply because their stage setup was so complex to bring over here that it wasn't financially...  German engineering.  So why didn't they just stand there?  Wonderful.  So they can make the money.  Because I don't think you need the treadmill.  Yeah, I agree.  Call me crazy.  I don't think you need the treadmill.  Treadmill's good.  It looks awesome.  It looks awesome, but do you really need it?  The guy just decided, look, I want to get a workout in every night.  Remember when ZZ Top had the treadmills on their fucking... 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I do.  They had, like, conveyor belts that were the entire width of the stage.  Dude, that...  I went to that show.  It was a pisser.  It rocked.  They'd be playing, and they're, like, fucking coming toward each other.  Yeah.  Like, they would, like, moonwalk, but they're fucking, like, on a big conveyor belt.  I'm doing my next stand-up special like that on a treadmill.  You should.  You should.  To the left and right.  Yes.  It's going to be called Left, Right, and All About.  Oh, that's a good title.  You're just All About.  You're just brought back a memory.  Yeah.  I went to that show. 
[01:02:00]  I went to that one, too.  It's got All About It until right now.  Nicole ZZ Top.  And it was all choreographed.  You're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  It was kind of like two treadmills, I guess, like, that met in the middle.  Right.  Eric Clapton.  What's he doing there?  Just fucking everything up.  Eric Clapton.  You're trying to fuck someone's wife?  Yeah.  I'm off already with Eric Clapton.  I'm so over Eric Clapton.  Talk about ripping off some of those black artists.  Layla.  Boo.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Not a fan of the Layla.  No.  Enough.  You think there's an original version of that somewhere?  Of course there is.  It's an original version of everything.  Some poor old black guy.  A lot of guys.  Sitting there in his fucking log cabin near a swamp.  A lot of guys in high school loved Eric Clapton.  He's one of the greatest guitar players ever.  Is he else?  I mean, yes, absolutely.  You will not talk to anybody. 
[01:03:00]  He bores me.  Dude, I swear to God, he bores me.  I'm not a fan of his, but I do recognize how amazing a guitar player he is.  I liked Cream.  Yeah, but I think he was almost a Beatle, too.  Fuck him.  He was hanging out with those.  Yeah.  Of course, he was hanging out with their chicks, too, apparently.  He was almost a Beatle.  Fuck Clapton.  Yes.  He was in that circle.  You don't like Cream?  They're good, yes.  They're very good.  I like Cream.  I like Cream.  He was a great guitarist, Clapton.  I like Cream.  I always better.  I like that fucking White Room.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's had some amazing tunes, but I'm sure he didn't write them. 
[01:03:30]  I like Glad.  Yeah.  I think there's a song called Glad by them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm so glad, right?  Jamiroquai has the conveyor belt.  Jamiroquai was the fucking shit with the song.  Because he had it in the fucking video.  Yeah.  In that weird room of his.  Which was cool, because the whole floor was like a conveyor belt.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jamiroquai with his dumb hat.  Virtual Insanity.  Oh, God.  They're one hit.  No, but I think he's one of those artists that became huge elsewhere, but not in America. 
[01:04:00]  The one that Napoleon Dynamite danced to.  Yeah.  That was really a hit, though.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  He was kind of good in that movie.  That was Jamiroquai?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'm telling you, he was one of these guys that went overseas and was huge.  Jamiroquai?  He had the one hit in America, but he had a great career elsewhere.  America was done with him.  And Canada, too.  My wife told me he was big in Canada.  Canada?  Yeah.  Does that really count, though, when you have to go overseas?  Aha is one of those bands.  Aha had the one hit in America, but were huge in the rest of the world for a long time. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When Jamiroquai came out on stage with treadmills like this, it was like, we are in the 90s.  Oh, fuck yeah.  The future is now.  It's the 90s.  Word up.  Walk in, but not walk in.  Uh-huh.  Right.  All right.  You know.  Conveyor belt.  Can we talk to Matt for a second?  Matt?  What's up, Matt?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys, you did an entire break when you were back at XFEM.  Right.  About Zeppelin completely ripping off this other band. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know what you guys are doing today.  No.  Are you?  You're a liar.  Yeah.  I don't hear it at all.  Are you sure the colors are wrong?  Look at that pregnant belly on her now.  Yeah.  She is so pregnant.  She was hiding it.  Her rump looks really good, though.  Nicole's hiding looks good, yeah.  She still looks sexy.  And Nicole looks aight.  She knows we're looking at her ass.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I probably shouldn't have mentioned that she's pregnant on the air, though, just in case. 
[01:05:30]  Fucking Dennis Falcone.  Holy shit.  Dennis Falcone found out yesterday what the spectrum is.  He didn't even know what the spectrum was?  He asked me in the office what the spectrum is.  No.  What's the spectrum?  What's he talking about when he says spectrum?  I was like, I don't know.  He's highly functioning.  Yeah.  I think he's on the outskirts of the spectrum.  He's absolutely in the spectrum.  I told him the spectrum has broadened quite a bit.  Do you think he's like a tick or two above Bobo?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's very functional.  Bobo's deep in the spectrum.  He's like a trainable.  Yeah, but he can still take the bus in here. 
[01:06:00]  A trainable.  Hey, Matt, thanks, but we're not buying into the whole segment.  We're ripping off other artists' thing.  Sorry.  You guys might be wrong.  I feel like...  He's trying to say we did a whole break on it?  That's stupid.  Okay.  Waste an entire break.  We should take a break.  Please.  Bill Barr's coming in today.  We're really excited.  Hey, hey, mama said the way you grow, don't make you grow.  Don't make you grow.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, mama said the way you grow, don't make you grow.  Don't make you grow.  What homemade instruments did they use?  It was actually a frying pan and a piece of the curtains.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's amazing.  It's amazing, the black artists that they could play with.  Our old pal, Bill Burr, is coming in today.  Did anyone else see this in front of him?  What happened?  It's from rollingstone.com, a little magazine called Rolling Stone, and the headline is  Bill Burr is the new Louis C.K. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, man.  A red-headed psycho from Boston?  Right, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking huge.  Our pal, Bill Burr, is blowing up in front of our eyes.  I mean, blowing the fuck up.  I don't like the fact that I have to now look at Bill Burr like a celebrity.  I don't like that.  He, uh, yeah, we've been friends with him for, God, I don't know, ten years now, right?  Yeah.  He's playing the Beacon Theater this weekend, and he'll be in the studio in about a half hour.  What is he doing? 
[01:07:30]  Jack White's playing a guitar that he made out of a Coke bottle.  I loved this documentary.  It's so fucking good.  What is it called again?  People should see this.  It might get loud.  Can you go back?  This is exactly what Ed's talking about.  This is the opening scene.  And Jack White, you know, takes pride in the fact that, you know, people came before him.  With disrespect, Jack White and Jay-Z in the same break.  Oh, Jack.  Look, he's got a Coke bottle, a hammer, some nails, and he's going to figure out an instrument.  Look, he's making a homemade guitar.  He's building stuff.  Look at his hat.  He looks awesome. 
[01:08:00]  He looks like he should be in front of a tent at a circus.  He's wearing a bow tie.  Getting people in there to see the bearded lady.  He's wearing a bow tie at the farm.  Of course he is.  I like Jack White.  We interviewed him once.  He could give a fuck about us or being interviewed.  He's a very tall gentleman.  Yeah, he is.  But I like his music.  How tall is he?  He's like 18 feet tall.  Oh, I would have thought shorter.  Yeah, no, he's very tall.  He was very nice when I met him.  Was he?  Yeah.  I would hope so.  There you go.  Look.  That's what you're talking about, Anthony.  Oh, there you go.  An old board.  A Coke bottle under the bridge.  Some wire. 
[01:08:30]  And then, yeah, a Coke bottle.  Now he puts another little thing as kind of a fretboard.  He's got the hat on.  What's he doing?  Why does he just go to fucking Sam Ash and buy a guitar?  You love him, Travis?  I really liked him until he ruined my evening.  Oh, I forgot about the Jack White experience you had.  How did you ruin your night?  He was an asshole that night.  Yeah, because he was an asshole.  He played for 45 minutes and then he walked off the fucking stage.  What was his problem again?  I forgot.  And, Jim, you can't make fun of the way musicians dress.  Putting a pickup on it now.  You're like, kids.  Yeah, that's true. 
[01:09:00]  But he's in a documentary about himself.  They wear shoes with dragons on them.  That's why I like them.  Exactly.  Making my point.  Is that him playing that?  Yes.  No, it's not.  Oh, I thought they went to a regular guitar.  What do you mean, no, it's not.  I saw the making of this documentary.  Holy fuck.  That's pretty cool.  Jack White is like the coolest motherfucker to ever walk the planet.  Yeah.  Yes.  No.  It's not.  I love Jack White.  Thank you.  I really love him.  If you love him so much, why don't you get a tattoo of his name? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  And then watch Clockwork Orange and see him ripping his look off from Alex.  He should be driving a car really fast down a fucking dirt road with the obvious screen  behind him.  Yes.  The 95 Durango?  Yes.  Put it away.  Real horror show.  Yeah.  What am I doing?  Hmm.  He just sounds like Robert Plant.  Hmm.  No, he's an original.  Yeah, he's completely right.  I think Jack White's an original.  But his voice sounds like Robert Plant.  He just sounds like him. 
[01:10:00]  In that particular song or sample, whatever.  He's a varied artist.  I like him.  When we come back, I want to discuss Bob Kelly's amazing podcast.  Really?  It's everything we should be doing.  Podcasting.  Oh my God.  It was fucking hilarious.  Was it fun?  Yeah.  Yes.  Live in front of an audience.  No bullshit.  A few guys with cameras.  All of us sitting up there.  Yeah.  How many people?  Well, whatever the Village Underground holds.  No, how many people on the stage?  Bobby.  I'm going from Bobby. 
[01:10:30]  I was to his left.  To my left was Bailey J.  To her left was this guy, Luis Gomez.  And then I forget the other guy's name on the end.  He's a newer guy, but he was funny.  To Bobby's right was Dan Soder, who was hilarious.  And to Dan's right was Kelly, the Australian girl.  So there's like seven of us on.  Wow, that's a lot of mics that are on at the same time.  Yeah, but so it was still funny, though.  It's still there was a lot of fucking.  Oh my God, did it work?  And Luis Gomez.  They were going to have a contest.  Who could suck a better dick? 
[01:11:00]  Him or Bailey J.  Wow.  And he went on and he brought his own dildo with him.  It was a little brownish colored dildo.  And it was fucking.  Jesus.  It was so funny.  And Bob Kelly stands up with his foot up on a fucking chair.  And that dumb dildo sticking out of his pants.  And Luis fucking sucks his.  It looked like he was sucking Bob's cock and he's got his hand under.  He's holding his ass.  Really?  The place went fucking nuts.  It was just a very, very funny podcast. 
[01:11:30]  They ripped us off.  Yeah, we did that shit years ago.  Oh, I remember that.  Sam fucking did that shit.  Not in front of an audience.  We didn't have photos.  Sam did that shit.  We got photos.  Yeah, I did.  Not in front of a crowd you did.  You wouldn't do it in front of a crowd.  And then I hit E.  That's putting yourself out there, though, to do that.  Holy crap.  And I happen to be in every dumb photo behind it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's going to ruin my career someday.  Very cool.  I want to kind of play a song and a break.  Sirens.  They're not going to like Sirens.  No, brother.  Play some of that Jack White shit.  But if you're going to the bathroom, then it doesn't matter. 
[01:12:00]  You can't worry about what they're going to like.  I like Sirens.  It doesn't matter.  It proves that Pearl Jam is still doing it with their new music.  Because a lot of people just don't acknowledge that Pearl Jam is still doing it with their new music.  Sure they do.  They're debuted at number one.  No, I know.  That's what I mean.  They're still doing it.  And Sirens, I think, is the best song off the new album.  I would probably agree.  Can we play Sirens?  Yeah, I got it.  Bill Burr is going to be in at 8 o'clock.  Nice.  And then this guy.  This other guy.  Who, who, who, who? 
[01:12:30]  Adawali Akanui Akanabaji.  What?  Adabisi from Oz.  Oh, that's all I need to know.  Mr. Echo.  He's got a, I mean, if he wants to be.  He's been in before.  Yeah, but if he wants to be in Hollywood, he's got to change his name.  It's not working.  He is in Hollywood.  No, I mean, I mean really in Hollywood.  What's he, what's he promoting?  Thor.  He's in Thor.  Oh.  He's having a tough time.  He's in the soon to be number one movie.  Yeah.  I got you.  But if he really wants to take off, he's got to change his name. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, that's just ridiculous.  He's also on Broadway, I think.  That's what happens to me after I work out.  What?  I get Thor.  That's what happens to you.  You're an asshole after sex.  From Lightning Bolt, Pearl Jam, Sirens.  Bill Burr on the way.  Hear the sirens, hear the circus so close. 
[01:13:30]  Hear the sirens, hear the sirens, hear the circus so close.  I hear the sirens, hear the sirens.  I hear the sirens.  I hear the sirens.  More and more in this here town. 
[01:14:00]  Let me catch my friend.  Let me catch my friend to breathe.  Let me reach across the bend.  Just to know we're safe.  I am a grateful man.  This light is a good boy.  This light has been alive and I can see you clear.  Have to take your hand and feel your breath. 
[01:14:30]  Be careful.  Fear this Sunday will get over.  I pull you close, so I still know.  Knowing that nothing lasts forever  I didn't care  Before you were here  I'd never get back  Or will it be ever after 
[01:15:00]  But all things changed  Let this remain  Hear the sirens  Covering beers and send the night 
[01:15:30]  The sound they're going closer  Will they call for me next time  Oh, every choice, mistake I've made  It's not my plan  To send you in the arms of another man 
[01:16:00]  And if you choose to stay  I'll wait, I'll understand  It's a fragile thing  This life we lead  If I spend too much  I can't get over  Welmed by the graves  But I wish we'd live our lives  With death over our shoulders 
[01:16:30]  Want you to know  That shut our door  I always love you  As you have thought to  I'll study your face  But fear goes away  I'll see you next time  I'll see you next time 
[01:17:00]  I'll see you next time  I'll see you next time  I'll see you next time  I'll see you next time  It's a fragile thing 
[01:17:30]  It's a fragile thing  It's a fragile thing  It's a fragile thing  If I spend too much  I can't get over  Welmed by the graves  I wish we'd live our lives  With death over our shoulders  Won't you to know 
[01:18:00]  That shut our door  I always loved you  Hold you high or two  I'll stay your face  And the fear goes away  The fear goes away  The fear goes away  The fear goes away 
[01:18:30]  The fear goes away  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:19:00]  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to The O.P. and Anthony Show.  This was an alright song when it came out, right?  I think everybody liked the video, too, because it was wacky. 
[01:19:30]  He's in that room, just fucking sliding around.  The furniture isn't moving, but he is.  With that big, huge Mad Hatter hat.  Yes, he had the dumb hat on.  And you're like, how is he doing this?  It was well done.  Pretty amazing.  He looked like Marky Mark in this video a little bit.  Yeah.  What?  Who is this?  That's a Donnie look.  Do you think he'd look more Donnie?  I think he looks like Donnie Wahlberg.  Yeah, he does look a little Donnie Dunn.  Who is it? 
[01:20:00]  Jamiroquai.  Jamiroquai.  You don't remember this video, Jimmy?  I do, but I remember this song.  This was a huge hit.  Bill Burr coming in at 8 o'clock.  Playing the Beacon Theater for the comedy festival, right?  Yes, I think Friday night.  There's two shows.  I think we're going to the second show.  I've got to see Bill Burr.  I think it's 10.30, the second show.  Probably.  I might have to go see Kathy Griffin.  What?  Exactly. 
[01:20:30]  For what?  Well, we have some friends that are...  Yeah.  Is it her show, Jerry Seinfeld is the Devil?  We have some friends that go that way.  Oh, boy.  And that's what they want to do.  Oh, boy.  So I might be dragged.  You'll enjoy it, I think.  She's a good stand-up.  I don't like her at all.  Have you seen her stand-up?  Call her schmutzy.  I've seen Clicks.  I just don't like her. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I think she's a funny...  She's a good storyteller.  Like, you know, she's...  I am?  Yeah, I kind of like that.  She's in Pulp Fiction.  We might do the dinner thing and then go, oh, wow, we can't get a...  We couldn't get a babysitter.  And then we're going to sneak over and see Bill Burr.  There you go.  That's how you think...  I think that's our move.  That's a good move.  Although I think they listen to the show, so fuck.  Why don't you just tell them you'd rather see Bill?  Yeah, so maybe we'll do the dinner and then, fine, they'll go.  Or just go see Kathy Griffin.  I was thinking that to go, just to go, I guess.  I bet it would open your mind and you'd come back in and be like, you know what? 
[01:21:30]  She was actually funny.  I don't know what it is.  I don't like her.  She tries too hard or something.  She tries to get outrageous, but it's like so forced at times.  Her and Anderson Cooper.  You've seen the New Year's Eve shit with her.  Oh, she's always getting everyone in trouble.  It's a huge hit, though.  With her blowjob jokes.  So I'm completely wrong, because they're a huge hit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, a lot of people love when those two get together.  People tune in. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, I know it's a story from yesterday, but I need to know what happened to this guy  that got pulled over and then, like, I don't know, things got shoved up his ass or something?  Oh, my God.  Doug Stanhope tweeted this link.  Right.  And I went to it and checked out the story, and oh, my God, what an blatant abuse of power this was.  So we could just play the video, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's a news story?  Uh-huh.  We're talking about the man repeatedly violated up the ass after just a traffic stop. 
[01:22:30]  Well, why did they stop him?  He rolled through a stop sign.  That's it?  Yeah.  Hello!  I think that's fair punishment.  He rolled through a stop sign.  And then how does it escalate to things going up your ass?  Well, listen to the story.  All right.  We have it right here.  Okay.  From four on your side investigating.  Oh, thank God they're on my side.  Someone needs to be on my side.  Yuck.  It started out as a minor traffic stop, but the next 14 hours would turn into a humiliating 
[01:23:00]  violation of a New Mexico man's body by police and doctors.  Four on your side investigating.  And doctors?  Yes.  Wait, do you hear this?  Is law enforcement in one community going way too far?  I have to ask?  The contents of this story are not suitable.  Oh, shut up.  Oh.  It's terrifying.  I mean, it's absolutely a nightmare.  Shannon Kennedy is a civil rights attorney. 
[01:23:30]  And when you hear this story, you'll understand why a New Mexico man called her for help.  I mean, it's absolutely unimaginable that this could happen in America.  Here's the story.  Lordsburg resident David Eckerd was shopping at this Walmart in Deming.  When he left the parking lot, he didn't make a complete stop at the stop sign as he merged  into traffic.  Hmm.  Police stopped him.  What happens next is documented in medical reports, police reports, and now a federal  lawsuit.  They say that he, when he stepped out of his car, he was standing in a manner that looked 
[01:24:00]  as if he was clenching his buttocks.  That's right.  Suddenly, this was no longer a minor traffic stop.  It was an investigation into Eckerd's buttocks.  Police note that a drug dog alerted to a possible odor of drugs on Eckerd's car seat.  And so, police concluded Eckerd might be hiding drugs in his anal cavity.  The court showed Deming police held Eckerd in custody while they secured a warrant signed 
[01:24:30]  by a judge allowing a search of his anal cavity.  Can you believe this?  Lawsuit states, police took him to the Deming emergency room at Membris Hospital, but a  doctor there told police he wouldn't perform the search because it was ethically wrong.  Surgery.  Next stop, the Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City, where doctors there agreed  to help.  And here's where things go badly for Eckerd, very badly.  According to court records and medical charts, first, doctors x-rayed Eckerd, then penetrated 
[01:25:00]  his rectum with their fingers, then performed another exam with their fingers.  Wow.  Doctors then gave Eckerd three enemas and forced him to defecate in front of them while they  searched to stool.  Can you believe this?  These things done without consent, all of them finding nothing.  But it didn't stop there.  Doctors performed a second x-ray.  Then they sedated Eckerd, prepared him for surgery, and performed a colonoscopy. 
[01:25:30]  What?  This animation shows how far the scope goes as it travels, through the anus, rectum,  colon, and into the intestines.  Eckerd protested each medical procedure.  The thought that they could do this to a man in our country is terrifying.  This is...  I mean, our community should be outraged.  These fucking cocksuckers should have their...  They should have their fucking...  They should literally never be allowed to practice medicine again.  No!  The cops should go to jail, and so should the fucking doctors. 
[01:26:00]  This is such an abuse of power and public trust and medical ethics, and there's so much  comes into play here.  How do you justify doing all this to a guy that you suspect might be squirreling some dope  up his ass, and meanwhile he wasn't, but even if he was, does that fucking give justification  for that? 
[01:26:30]  It's insane.  How does the story end?  Oh, the doctor...  Eckerd coming on his own leg.  Did they at least give him a lollipop after all that?  It's something, right?  Where's the rest of the little story?  Traveling through that part of our state to be careful and to be on guard.  There's a line right here, and it's important because this line separates Luna County from  Grant County.  Ew, I hated that little jump.  Why did he do that?  He's jumping.  He's in Grant County.  He's on the county line between Luna County and Grant County, and he does a little jump back 
[01:27:00]  and forth to show that he can jump between the counties.  Ew.  That's where the county line is, because he's trying to make a point.  Because this search warrant was only good in Luna County, but all those medical procedures  happened over here in Grant County.  Oh, boy.  We took all of this to the chief of Deming Police.  In terms of just being able to sit down and just chat for a few minutes, what do you have 
[01:27:30]  a couple minutes right now to do that?  No, sir.  Anything pertaining to that specific case, we're going to refer you all to Tony Ortiz,  our attorney in Santa Fe.  Perfect.  Okay.  Yeah, we can contact him.  Okay.  You know, just one question.  As the police chief of Deming, what reassurances could you give people that when they come through  your town, that they're not going to be abused or violated by your police officers?  We follow the law in every aspect and follow procedures and protocols that we have in place.  And do you think he's shitting himself? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  The chief of police here.  Do you think that he wants to fuck this guy in the ass so bad?  Sir, I'm going to refer that one.  Don't answer.  Of course.  In an email, Tony Ortiz wrote, he won't comment, but added that the city of Deming will prevail  in this matter.  How?  You might expect administrators here at Gila Regional Medical Center to defend their doctors,  maybe even defend patient care here.  Turns out they're not. 
[01:28:30]  Instead, they're issuing me a no comment, saying that this is a pending litigation matter, and  they're not going to comment on it.  Yeah, why would they do that?  And this is like something out of a science fiction film.  What doctors?  They should name the doctors.  Yeah.  By government, officials, and public employees.  Let's talk about your client today.  We were supposed to meet with your client.  He couldn't sit.  At the last minute, he backed out of...  Backed out?  How come?  He's terrified.  He's absolutely terrified.  What a lawsuit this guy has.  Wow.  Where police are able to harass people traveling through this community and people who live 
[01:29:00]  there, basically unchecked.  It started with the...  You know what I bet?  I bet you she told him, I'll speak for you.  Right.  Because you don't want to say anything...  Exactly.  ...that trips up this lawsuit.  Because they have such a home run.  Of course, boy.  She doesn't want him fucking it up for this dumb story.  Don't fuck that up.  Yeah.  You know, actually, I liked it a little bit.  Yeah.  It was all right.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta...  Keep your mouth shut out of what you're saying.  I don't want to say.  Right.  One guy burnt his lap with a cup of coffee and settled for just getting free coffee from 
[01:29:30]  a coffee place instead of...  Seinfeld.  Yeah, of course.  Ouch.  This whole thing is probably a Seinfeld episode.  It's the whole insertion.  It ended with eight anal medical procedures.  Coffee latte.  But there's one more thing.  Wow.  The Gila Regional Medical Center billed Eckert for those procedures and is even threatening 
[01:30:00]  to take him to collections if he doesn't pay.  They're billing him for sticking shit up his ass.  That's the bureaucracy in this country.  Yes.  Of course.  That's the bureaucracy in this country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Case by case basis shit.  That realize, oh my god, we really shouldn't have done all this stuff, so let him slide  on the bill at least.  That is...  They're charging him.  Charging him.  That's amazing.  It's not amazing.  Of course it's not amazing.  It's completely expected.  Yeah, that's just a fucking amazing abuse of power authority. 
[01:30:30]  Well, we got law enforcement on the line.  All right.  Did he get the stop...  Did he run the stop sign?  That's the question.  That's right.  Bob in Arizona.  Bob, what do you got on this?  Well, I'm just thinking from a Leo perspective here, they very well could have had advanced  information that this guy was crossing with stuff, and it could have been a counter technique,  and that's why he's not talking.  The bottom line is they were 100% wrong, and they didn't show any type of just cause or any 
[01:31:00]  of that stuff.  It was bullshit.  They fucked up.  They fucked up.  You know what?  I agree with you 100%.  I think once the x-ray showed nothing, that's where it should have stopped.  Right.  And they should know better with the county and stuff, but...  Or wait it out.  Yeah.  Wait it out.  Yeah.  And where's his lawyer?  Where's this guy's lawyer?  Oh, I don't trust those ACLU lawyers for anything.  No, no.  You have the right to ask for a lawyer.  I'm sorry?  You can't just get pulled into a hospital and have your asshole searched under anesthesia 
[01:31:30]  without a fucking lawyer.  That's what I mean.  There could be so much...  They're not just going to sign off on a warrant without nothing.  You know what I mean?  They did.  And one doctor wouldn't do it.  What we just saw here, they fucked up royally.  They fucked up.  The only probable cause they had was that this guy seemed to be clenching his butt cheeks.  Right.  I mean, that...  Well, like you said, I mean, there could be more coming out later.  Well, then how is that not in the warrant?  And the dog smells rugs.  I mean, you can't just sign off on a warrant. 
[01:32:00]  You have to put the information that you have for the search in the warrant.  And I don't think suspected of clenching your butt cheeks warrants searching a man's asshole.  Well, like I said, I mean, there could be more.  It could be an ongoing investigation.  Stuff could be sealed.  We don't know at this point.  So it'll be interesting to see how it is.  It sounds completely outrageous.  I cannot think...  It does sound like once the first step showed nothing, that that probably should have stopped the whole process. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Yeah, and a guy's standing suspiciously, and you can't just haul him into a hospital and have his asshole searched.  I could tell you how you do it, hope.  It's quite the intrusion.  Yeah, very much.  Literally and figuratively speaking.  Yeah, that's...  Figuratively.  Yes.  And then, like, he must have just been like...  He must have just been like, all right, keep going.  Cha-ching. 
[01:33:00]  Cha-ching.  Cha-ching, you want to search with your fingers, I already got you.  And now, everything you do past that, it's more cash.  And that fucking piece of shit fucking hospital, these dummies bill him, so now it's all right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They fucking bill him.  What scumbags?  Yeah, that's the place we live.  The news made that story incredibly boring.  Did they?  Yes.  Tell that to my hard-on. 
[01:33:30]  All right, bro.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  You rock.  Yeah.  I mean, how much of...  How much of this shit's going on?  You know?  Right.  I'm...  I mean, I'm pretty pro-law enforcement, but...  Are you?  You've got to call it out when you do see some abuses.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  That's crazy.  Well, speaking of law enforcement, I guess, what, Ray Kelly, our top cop here in New York 
[01:34:00]  City, is leaving?  Coincidentally enough, right after the election?  He wants nothing to do with the new mayor.  He wants nothing to do with de Blasio.  Oh, boy.  And de Blasio wouldn't keep him on anyway, so he wants to leave before he's fired.  Right.  So he's going to get a nice public sector job in security and make a boatload of money.  But, yeah, he wants to know...  I'm sure de Blasio is going to appoint a very diverse leadership as far as the police 
[01:34:30]  department goes, someone that will change some of the policies of the NYPD, thus, you  know, getting New York back to where it was in the 70s and 80s.  Yeah.  What a bunch of dummies New Yorkers are to elect this guy.  Enjoy the ride.  Yeah, yeah.  Very interesting.  Because a lot of times you say the mayor can't, you know, he's the mayor, what could  he possibly do?  The mayor of New York City has a lot of power.  Just by appointing people, and the chief of police is a great example, you appoint a 
[01:35:00]  chief of police that has the same mindset as you do on policy and whatnot, they could  change the entire way law enforcement is run in New York.  And we didn't need to be in a new direction.  I think New York's going in a pretty fucking good direction.  Good direction.  Of course.  I will miss Bloomberg.  I can't believe I'm saying that.  But people bought into it.  The direction we've been on is a bad one for some reason.  Yeah.  There's a couple more law enforcement guys that really want in on this story. 
[01:35:30]  Jay in New Jersey.  Jay.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Jay.  He doesn't have to call him that.  What's up, Jay?  How you doing?  I'm good.  A couple issues with that is, these days, they're all sticking to drugs.  We're getting guys that have uncapped needles stuck up their ass.  And so now we all know that this could be a situation where they know the guy.  I'm not saying that this guy did that, but a lot of times they're frequent flyers. 
[01:36:00]  We deal with these guys every day.  And so we know that this guy usually has drugs shoved up his ass.  So he gets out of the car.  He looks like he's clenching his ass cheeks.  We think he probably does have it up his ass.  Then you go for the warrant.  With that said, I work for a pretty well-paid police department in New Jersey.  And they don't pay me enough to go through somebody's shit.  But how is clenching your butt cheeks probable cause for a warrant?  It's not probable cause, but it's the totality of the circumstances.  So if they've dealt with him before, I don't know if this particular person is like that. 
[01:36:30]  But I'm saying, as a case-by-case basis, it's possible that they've dealt with the guy before.  And they know that, you know, all our scumbags that are breaking the house, they're all heroin addicts.  They're all heightened dogs.  All these house-breaking, they're stealing all the copper out of the house.  You know, people come home.  All right.  Jay, Jay, I get all that.  You made a good point.  But why did it continue after the x-ray?  It seems like the x-ray should have taken care of everything. 
[01:37:00]  Listen, I don't know what happened with that department.  I mean, you basically have to walk by me and fall down, and the drugs have to fall on the floor before I'm going to go.  Pop out your ass, right.  They're some motivated people down there.  They love asses.  They couldn't wait to get in his asshole.  Love a little ass play.  Yeah, I guess they got the warrant, and that's what they do.  Now, the cops follow their protocol, most likely.  They got the warrant.  After that, the doctors do everything. 
[01:37:30]  It's not like they're searching through the guy's asshole.  Right.  It's the doctors that are doing it, and then they do what they've got to do.  Once they take him to the hospital, it's like, all right, we have this warrant.  Go ahead.  We have a similar thing in New Jersey.  I understand all that, but, I mean, the x-ray, it was extremely excessive.  Yeah, once you do the x-ray, you pretty much can see if there's anything shoved up his ass.  And then maybe go watch him for a little while.  Figure out some kind of charge where you can put him in a cell for what.  I don't know.  We're going to get most of it out in 24 hours tops. 
[01:38:00]  After the x-ray, there was probably no need to continue, but I guess they were like, the doctors, we're going to continue with it.  All right.  We get your point.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to Eric in Tampa.  Eric.  Eric.  Yeah, I used to work at Customs, and we had quite a few internals coming in from South America, Jamaica, things of that nature.  And when you have border search authority, you have to articulate your facts as to why someone may be doing something.  And a lot of it's information that they're in history in the past. 
[01:38:30]  But to cut to the chase of the hospital, you take them to the hospital and have an x-rayed, and a lot of times you can see clearly what the anomaly is, what the foreign object is that's in their intestines or stomach or whatever.  But sometimes you'll have something that just shit looks like a cloud.  Sometimes there's lung that doesn't look right.  It's a palm, right?  T.S. Eliot?  Think shit looks like a cloud?  I love that one. 
[01:39:00]  You'll see a little lump in there.  Now, sometimes it all depends on it's not the doctor so much as the x-ray technician who's reading that x-ray.  And if they think there could be something in there, it looks like a foreign object, an anomaly in the intestines, you know, they're saying, well, there could be something in there.  So, at that point, it is kind of out of the cop's hands.  You do rely on the medical staff there.  And I've had doctors that say, you know, I'm not going to go any further because I don't think there is.  And they will sometimes go to another doctor for a second opinion if the cops are kind of, not to say, adamant about, but if they have, you know, reasonable suspicion that there's something else. 
[01:39:30]  There's more information that's probably unsealed that they weren't that judge and said, hey, it's not just a puckered up ass that we need to look at this guy.  There's probably a history on him.  Wow.  I don't know.  I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, there is, yeah, I've seen people get sued, you know, and go to a federal judge and, you know, they look at the facts and look at the situation, the quality of it. 
[01:40:00]  And, you know, it's pretty intrusive.  Well.  There's more to the story.  And something, something flew by there and none of us comment on.  The uncapped needle up his ass.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you do that?  I don't know about that.  How the fuck do you handle that?  Yeah.  And that other story says an uncapped needle up his ass.  That doesn't sound like it's even possible.  It's either going to be a problem on the way in or on the way out, depending on how you squirrel it up there. 
[01:40:30]  That's unbelievable.  Squirrel it up there.  Bill Burr in the studio.  Thank you, Eric.  All right, Bill.  Nothing has changed here.  We're talking about assholes.  I came in.  I didn't know that you guys were on a phone call.  On the phone.  Yeah, we were all quiet.  And I came in like, hey, how's it going?  And none of you guys were talking.  I was just like, wow, there was some sort of rift.  There must be some small contract negotiations going on here.  Oh, there's always some problem.  There was a story in New Mexico.  Some guy got pulled over for a roll and threw a stop sign.  And then the police and doctors were involved and checked his asshole. 
[01:41:00]  Like, violated this guy for hours on end.  Trying to see if he had something up his ass.  Because when he...  He was walking funny?  Yes.  Yeah, he was clenched.  He clenched a little bit.  That was their cause.  They got a drug dog involved, too, right?  And they smelled the seat.  They smelled the seat and smelled drugs.  So they're assuming that he had to have drugs up his ass.  So they brought him to two different hospitals.  The first hospital wouldn't do anything.  Second hospital went all in.  If you shove your fingers up his ass, you're going to have to appear in court in the morning  and show calls.  So they went x-ray, they went two exams with fingers, and then they did a colonoscopy. 
[01:41:30]  All to try to find the drugs on this guy.  It was 14 hours.  Please tell me they found something.  No.  Yeah, a bunch of logs in a lawsuit.  Oh, and then they gave him enemas, too, so he would shit.  And then they went through his shit in front of him.  They were all in for 14 hours.  They fucked with this guy, this asshole.  14 hours, he's fucking cock-sucking.  And they found nothing.  All because he rolled through a stop sign.  Jesus Christ.  That's a violation.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:42:00]  Like, what sort of walk did this guy have?  He was clenching his butt.  You know, you have your underwear around your ankles, and you go over to the bathroom after  rubbing one out?  Yeah, yeah.  Was he doing that walk?  That little penguin walk.  Yeah.  Sir, do you have something in your buttocks?  Or, you know, usually if you've got to take maybe a dump, you'll clench.  John, that's going to be, I mean, I feel bad for the guy, but that's going to be a hilarious  transcript where the defense prosecuting attorney is asking, what was your probable cause? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's clenching his buttocks, sir.  Like, is something up there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, that'll be a great court transcript.  The stenographer just fucking...  By the way, Richie Incognito.  I tweeted this yesterday.  That is the greatest WWF name never used.  Dude, right?  That is like a perfect manager.  Yes.  Before we bring out the moondogs, Richie Incognito.  And as he's walking into the camera, he's putting on his sunglasses. 
[01:43:00]  His sunglasses.  Let me tell you something, McMahon.  Come this Saturday night.  I thought it was like a made-up name.  Like, it was like his football name.  His nickname or something?  Nickname.  Right.  But it turns out that's his real last name?  Yeah.  Like, he was born with that name?  That is the greatest...  He's a motherfucker.  Crazy name.  What's a cool last name to have?  But incognito.  In the paper today, there's a writer saying that the NFL has to get rid of all the hazing  now that the sports teams do.  This team is defending him.  His teammates are defending him.  Because they understand the culture, that this shit goes down. 
[01:43:30]  These guys were friends.  This guy was playing the voicemail for people.  This guy's full of shit.  There's also another thing that says the coach was telling incognito to kind of get on this  guy, toughen him up or something.  I never read of Mice and Men, but it seems like they got the big guy to do the job.  And he's like, okay, boss.  That's all you.  F an N-word.  Put your N-word in.  And they sit in the background and go, hey, Richie, easy, easy.  We meant, you know, toughen him up, not fucking.  Don't try to convince him that hard. 
[01:44:00]  I thought that's what you wanted.  He doesn't seem that smart in general, but.  The Adventures of Richie Incognito.  I fucking love that name.  But bullying in the NFL, that's just insane.  That headline alone is crazy.  It really is.  It seems like the hazing is just, you go out to dinner with them and all of a sudden  you're left with the check.  Oh, you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's not like, hazing is what happened to that guy who got his ass searched.  That's it.  There you go.  That's a nice hazing. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Back in the day, that was called pledging a frat.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well.  The old football.  Remember that football camp story with the pine cones?  Oh, yeah.  We've told him on the air.  Oh, yeah.  I had to carry marshmallows.  Marshmallows in his ass.  And drop it on.  Drop them in a cup.  No, drop them on the rival fraternity's fake fraternity house.  Was it like a little dollhouse you had to drop it on?  We had a bomb.  Pilot to Bombardier.  I'm scared to even mention the fraternity.  Did you spread the Bombay doors? 
[01:45:00]  There's still guys out there, even though we're a lot older, that take this shit very seriously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when I get with them, they look at me like, what the fuck, giving out our secrets?  Why don't you just show the handshake?  Right.  Right.  I never understood.  That's why I never joined a frat.  I never understood that.  I was young and dumb.  It's like, you're going to do all that stuff to me, and then I'm going to hang out with  you?  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to be friends.  It's like, I want to kill you.  It's a rape.  Why don't you respect the guy that just did all that?  Now I want to hang with you after you carry those things in your asshole across the floor. 
[01:45:30]  Maybe you do some fucking really kind of pseudo-gay thing.  You're blindfolded a lot.  That's how it works.  That's good.  So you have no idea which guys in the fraternity really hate you.  It's kind of like Twitter, with the fake names and shit.  I'd have more respect if I didn't have a blindfold on, so I could see these guys and their hate.  Yeah, grab the banana duty, and we'll all spank you in a line, and then we want to hang  with you.  It's just creepy and fucking weird.  What's worse?  Well, the best one that made me laugh really hard, we were pledging, and all hell broke 
[01:46:00]  loose.  And the problem in the fraternity house was that one of the Eggo pigs, one of the sorority  girls, they were known for being the big girls on campus, took a shit in one of our bathrooms  and, oh boy, we can't have that.  So we had to go in there and fucking break down the shit.  But it wasn't really shit, was it?  Well, I mean, it all depends.  Sort of a shit batter.  If they liked you as a banana, if they liked you as a banana, if they didn't like you, 
[01:46:30]  you know, one of the guys could get something done.  Did you guys ever read, in Rolling Stone, had that article, I think it was about Dartmouth?  Oh, I don't know.  They have something up there that's called the vomlet.  The vomlet?  Oh, no.  I don't know if I can tell this story without gagging, but you know what an omlet is.  Of course.  Okay, can you know what that ingredient rhymes with?  Yeah.  Vomlet, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So they make a vomit omelet?  Oh, gross.  God damn it.  I knew a guy that used to eat people's puke.  He would eat people's puke out of the fucking grass. 
[01:47:00]  Do you guys still do the eggnog contest?  We haven't done that in quite some time.  No.  The lawyers frowned upon bodily fluids.  I'm telling you, dude, I'm coming up on 22 years in the business, and that is the most  insane thing I've ever seen.  It was fucking crazy.  That was crazy.  I wish I knew that I realized that I was on the top of the mountain that day.  That's it.  The pinnacle.  That was the pinnacle.  It kind of slowly went away after that.  Rogan was the one who took it to the next level.  The baby bird thing.  We thanked Joe Rogan for that one. 
[01:47:30]  Yep.  Hey, the football thing there with Incognito.  What's worse, though?  Somebody's spouting off some fucking slurs.  Or the fact that Tony Dorsett can't even recognize himself anymore.  Did you hear about that?  What?  Oh, no.  He's fucking like...  When did this come out?  I was listening to the news this morning.  They had him talking, and it's like, he can't speak.  He can't even fucking...  He looks in the mirror and doesn't know himself, and fucking...  He's just like...  Oh, no.  This is why the NFL...  And it's all the head injuries. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, but don't celebrate after a touchdown.  Yeah, that's the important thing.  Thank God they have their priorities in order.  How old is...  Dorsett can't be more than 60, 65?  He's 59.  Wow.  But at every point they try to make things a little safer, the fans get mad.  Like, if they say something like, no head-on-heads, everyone's like, what are you, bunch of faggots?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No head-on-heads!  But it's them out there.  They're not robots.  They're real people.  They know all those.  Hits are causing some major issues.  Yeah.  You know who amazed me?  These guys when they get older. 
[01:48:30]  Was Jim McMahon.  Because Jim McMahon can't drive anymore because he can't find his own house.  And I don't ever remember seeing him, you know, taking a lot of...  Taking hits like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe he's just dumb.  Well, what do they say about...  That headband was too tight.  Cut off the circulation.  No, he used to headbutt the lineman after touchdowns.  Wow.  Dorsett, where's the video?  I heard it on 1010 Winds this morning, and they had some audio of him talking about  how he can't fucking...  Could you find that?  Yeah.  Remember shit.  We all remember Tony Dorsett. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  I love them.  They're my idols.  He was a rock star.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe head injuries?  Yeah, this should be it.  This is it.  In his Hall of Fame career, Tony Dorsett experienced moments of glory.  He also took blows to the head.  The worst one, he says, was a violent hit in a Cowboys-Eagles game in 1984.  It reminded me of a Mack truck.  Oh, shit. 
[01:49:30]  He looks horrible.  A Volkswagen.  I mean, he just blew me up.  Did they call it a concussion?  No, they called that a knockout.  Dorsett says he doesn't know how many concussions he suffered during his 12 years in the NFL.  But he says they were numerous, and he still deals with the consequences.  My memory, it's getting worse and worse as the days go by.  My short-temperedness, I'm really short-tempered. 
[01:50:00]  It gets worse.  This one here, I'm going to show you.  Dorsett, who turns 60 next April, says he is prone to outbursts at his wife and daughters.  It's painful, man.  For my daughters to say they're scared of me.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Geez.  Oh, man.  Poor Tony Dorsett.  This is depressing. 
[01:50:30]  I don't want to see this.  This is depressing.  We did it to Bill Burr again.  I don't know.  He's doing anything else.  Does he drink at all, or is it just from this?  Have you found yourself dealing at all with depression?  I've been diagnosed as being depressed, yes.  And I'm in denial.  I said, I'm not depressed.  What are you talking about?  Clinically, I'm depressed.  At his lowest moments, Dorsett says he has thought about suicide. 
[01:51:00]  You know, I've thought about crazy stuff.  Sort of like.  He looks nuts.  Yes, he does.  Boy, that family must walk on eggshells around him.  Yeah.  I mean.  Okay, Tony.  Don't ever say Emmett.  I'm too smart of a person.  I like to think to take my life.  But it's crossed my mind.  Jeez.  You can see my front loaves.  Dorsett says he wanted answers that could explain his symptoms.  Oh, my God.  Dude, shut it up.  Bill.  Fucking Bill.  Do you know the NFL? 
[01:51:30]  The NFL settled.  Settle for.  Do you want to pause that, Sam?  For nothing, really.  Yeah, and part of their settlement is all the information that they had throughout the years  is now.  Goes away.  Goes away.  Yep.  Scumbags.  Yep.  Fucking scumbags.  They got away with murder.  What, they had to pay out $700 million?  Was that the number?  Yeah, it came out to like.  Nothing for them.  Yeah, like something, you know, $10,000 a guy.  Something like that.  Some ridiculous pathetic number.  And then all the research and all the info they had.  Yep.  They don't have to show anyone. 
[01:52:00]  They know what this is doing to these players.  All these English people who give me shit saying rugby's tougher.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is, I want to see, I don't want to see this in their sport because they actually lead  with the show.  And I'm not saying rugby guys aren't tough, but they, they always say, oh, you're a bunch  of, you're a bunch of pussies with your fucking helmets.  Like, this is, when you wear like helmets and stuff, you feel invincible.  But it doesn't matter.  It's not.  You hit harder because you have a helmet on.  Yeah.  But your brain, there's no way to stop that brain from slamming around. 
[01:52:30]  Your brain is slamming around in your skull.  It doesn't matter that you're not making contact on the top of your head or that.  It protects your skull.  It protects your skull and your scalp and whatever.  But the brain is still fucking, you know.  There's some room in there, no matter what.  Yeah, yeah.  If you shake an egg carton, the shit inside the eggs is still going fucking all over the  place.  That's what the brain is.  You know, I love it.  Those four dummies.  It took us that long just to get to an analogy that works.  Right.  I was so happy when you picked up my slop where I was like, helmet is, it's like. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That's why my nickname, I'm the master of egg examples.  Every example.  On my new headshots.  Every analogy is just an egg example for you.  How sad is Tony Dorsett laying out his CAT scans on his table, explaining his frontal lobe.  He looks frightening.  I wouldn't want to be in the same room with that guy.  Dude, it's just like boxing.  It's towards the end of the career, you take those blows.  Right.  There was one on Ali right before he fought Larry Holmes. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, he is like, he sounds like he's drunk.  He's like slurring his words.  Oh, gosh.  Already.  Already.  And then he took that, I mean, took that beating.  That sound thrashing.  Yeah, I would have died.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bad mustache he had in that fight.  It was a weird, weird fight.  And 10 rounds.  I think, I think Liger Holmes cry after that because he beat, he didn't want to hurt Ali.  Oh, yeah.  He kept looking at the ref like.  Jesus.  Just stop this damn thing.  Yeah.  Stop the fight.  And that's why Ali is how he is today.  No doubt in my mind.  Yeah.  That's a big part of it, man. 
[01:54:00]  He took some.  Major parts.  He hit some fucking big, big punchers.  Ali took some big punches.  Yeah.  15 rounds with fucking Norton.  Bill Burr's in town and play the Beacon Theater.  You don't need to sell tickets, obviously.  Friday night.  Yeah.  Bill's got two shows Friday night.  Two shows Friday night at the Beacon Theater.  I'm going to the late show.  I gotta see Bill Burr.  Yeah.  And then we saw the heat the other day.  Oh, yeah.  I wrote you.  It made me want to see you more in the movie.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  You killed it in every scene you were in.  That when she first walks in and you're just going off about how she should arrest each 
[01:54:30]  of the people for what they did.  I was fucking dying.  Oh, yeah.  I hate that you're fucking, you come in here now and I gotta be like, oh, it's Bill, this  fucking movie guy now.  It's not just some dick bag that used to just fucking knock around the clubs.  But even the subtle stuff at the end of the movie when you're like, hold it up!  Hold it up!  Oh, hold up the gun.  Well, Paul Feig, the guy who directs, he just lets you go.  Like, he does like five minutes.  When we were sitting at the table, there's so much stuff that he couldn't put in that 
[01:55:00]  I think will be on like the DVD extras or whatever.  Because believe me, dude.  Like, I am just a stand-up comic and those all were actors, you know, improv actors.  I was just trying to keep up.  Honestly.  Like, some of the stuff.  Well, in the final edit, they made me look good.  But I'm telling you, there was stuff I was just like, gee, I can't keep up with you guys.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It didn't come across like that at all.  How's Melissa McCarthy?  Oh, dude, she's the best. 
[01:55:30]  She's such a sweetheart.  And she's like, honestly, like stand-up comic funny.  Right.  Like, just in between takes, just when she would tell stories.  She would basically be trading stories about bombing.  She told some story about, I don't know, some sketch she was doing.  And it was going so bad.  It was her and somebody else.  And she just looked at the other guy right in the middle of the sketch.  She was just like, I'm out of here.  And she did this backwards somersault through the curtain and just left the guy there. 
[01:56:00]  And the way she said, I'm out of here.  She said it like, I'm sorry to do this to you.  But she also knew the funny.  And I was thinking, that's something Norton would do to me.  Oh, that's great.  So Patrice would do something like that.  And just left him out there and was behind the curtain just laughing her ass off.  That's fucking funny, man.  I mean, that's something, if somebody ever did that to me when I was 80, I would still  bring that up to him.  Just dying laughing.  So that was...  That's goddamn funny. 
[01:56:30]  That's really funny.  Backwards somersault.  And then Sandra Bullock.  Obviously, that's when you were in the tabloids with her.  That nonsense.  That was the movie you guys were filming.  She laughed about that.  She laughed about that.  They were trying to link Bill Burr and Sandra Bullock.  Yes.  That was not one ounce of truth.  No, I know.  No, we went over this with you.  Yeah.  It was funny.  Oh, I know.  We were in the movie together.  But yeah.  Yeah.  She was great, too.  Because when we did the scene at the table, like we were doing these five-minute takes. 
[01:57:00]  And we were basically just going off on her.  And you felt bad after a while, because it was just a one-way kind of thing.  Right.  Or she's just like, no, I am a woman.  And everyone was just sitting there going up.  And she was so cool.  And she was laughing about it.  And like, you know, it wasn't...  Yeah.  You're a boy or a girl.  Special like retarded.  Yeah.  Like retarded.  We don't use that word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fooled him again.  Yeah.  Somehow gotten that one. 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  Fooled him again.  We have to break.  But Bill Burr is here.  How long have we got you for, Bill?  Till about 10.  I'm going to the end of the show.  Nice.  Perfect.  Beautiful.  All right.  That's going to stop soon.  Bill doesn't change.  No, I don't think so.  That'll stop soon.  That would suck it, Bill.  It'd be out in 20 minutes.  I got to go.  Oh, they're telling us you got to go, Bill.  You got other stuff to promote and do.  Yep.  Oh, the dad come in here with a written a book.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, I got my, uh, the trials and tribulations of being Burr. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know how you do that.  If I had to write a book about my life, it would be like eight pages long.  I just, there's no way I could, like, try to flesh it out.  Like, it was an autumn morning.  It's just like, hey, I was born in Massachusetts.  I sucked in school and I became a comic.  Here I am.  The cover would be Bill with his hands out.  And his book is called, Bill Burr, How I Did It.  Oh, my God.  Burr is so far.  That's terrible.  I take the terrible, awful things in my life. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to catch up.  I've learned to forgive myself.  Oh, God.  We're going to catch up with Bill after these messages.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  SiriusXM. 
[01:59:00]  Jimmy's a picture guy.  You're a picture guy.  I am a picture guy.  I'm listening to Bill tell the Rich Voss Don Cheadle story.  That's a great story.  You've got to have Voss tell it.  Let's get him on the phone, man.  When you meet somebody and ask for a picture, do you lose status with them?  And sometimes you do, but I have enough people who have been on this radio show, sat where  Bill is sitting, and then I see them a month later, and they have no idea we've ever met.  So I'm like, even a real interaction, and I give them a great interview, and it means  nothing.  So my interaction with them don't mean anything anyway.  But look, I think if you come in and do a radio show, they usually have the banner in 
[01:59:30]  the background.  It's part of the whole promoting whatever the project you're doing.  That's different.  But I'm just saying, you know.  It's an event.  He's playing golf with the guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Voss probably has like a dummy, too.  Okay.  Yeah.  You've got to say it like, hey, man, let's take a picture together.  Right, right.  You've got to make it look like two pals instead of, you know.  Okay.  Turned him into a zoo animal.  Bill Burr.  There was a couple things.  Oh, the Rolling Stone.  Oh, there's so much stuff we already did.  But we didn't do it for the people. 
[02:00:00]  Well, Rolling Stone Magazine, first of all, someone's got to say, did you, this, when  does this come out?  What's that?  The Rolling Stone article.  He's like, yeah, what's that?  I don't know.  This month.  The headline is Bill Burr's the new Louis C.K.  Damn.  Brutal.  That's great, dude.  That's just, that was embarrassing.  I feel bad for Louis.  That was really insulting to him.  I just did, you know, I did Kamau's show last night, the Totally Biased, and they brought  that up.  And I kind of broke it down how, like, I put out a special every other year. 
[02:00:30]  Louis does one basically every year and writes, acts, and directs an arguably the funniest  show on TV.  I couldn't be any further.  I was so insulting to him.  From the new Louis C.K.  Yeah, and they're writing about it like, you know, like he's not at the top of the  heat like he was 10 years ago.  The whole, I'm sure that they meant it in a complimentary way.  Maybe I'm just looking at it in a negative way, but it was just like, yeah, can I just  be Bill Burr?  I would have been happy with dancing clown Bill Burr. 
[02:01:00]  Still cool as hell, man.  It is cool.  Yes, it is.  It's easier to take a negative comparison and get mad about it than take a positive one  and feel honored.  Like, you know, if they would have said Bill Burr, he's the new, uh, he's the new, uh,  fucking Albert DeSalvo.  What the fuck?  I didn't make chills anybody.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  But it's like, Louis is a great compliment then.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't want to lose him.  We got Voss on the line.  Okay.  And then we'll go back to Bill Burr and Rolling Stone and some other, and we're going to  talk about, uh, the color pink and, uh, cars.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bill gives us a lot of fucking material.  I don't know where to go next. 
[02:01:30]  Rich.  Hey, how's it going?  Hi, Rich.  Bill Burr was just telling the, uh, the Don Cheadle story.  Uh, sort of.  I want you to tell it.  What happened was I was at a, uh, golf course.  Uh, I wish you, I wish you met him while you were buying donuts in the same place he was.  Fully nice.  Yes.  Oh.  Uh, and, so, it was, I guess, you know, during, like, Last Comic or whatever, and, uh, and  the director of Last Comic, Shani, was good friends with Don Cheadle. 
[02:02:00]  I mean, like, you know, they play golf all the time.  So, uh, Don Cheadle's finishing up his round.  I'm giving a short mind.  And he comes up to me.  He goes, he goes, hey, man, you're really funny.  I like you.  You're really good on this show.  And I said, oh, okay, thanks.  And I go, I, you know, I like what, the couple things you did.  And, and, uh, then, like, a minute, he's getting ready to leave.  I go, can I take a picture with you?  And he went from, like, entertainment pier. 
[02:02:30]  I went from entertainment pier to, like, fat female groupie.  Oh, man.  His face just dropped, like, oh, okay.  Uh, and, uh.  Oh, he thought he had a, he thought he was having, like, a, a moment.  With just another guy playing golf.  And then he realizes the entire time you guys were playing golf, you were just waiting for  the moment to ask him for a picture, like, of a little fanboy.  Yeah.  And, and, and, and, and, and the thing is, then I saw him at the Oscars, uh, and he, he asked 
[02:03:00]  for a video.  Can you, can you introduce my podcast?  I asked him if I could sit next to him when I go to his nomination for, uh, Hotel Rwanda.  But, no, he kind of, like, ugh, there goes that fucking groupie again.  Like, and I don't know.  Like, Norton does it with anybody that, anybody that's done from, like, red eye and up.  Norton will.  Are you mad that I haven't asked you yet? 
[02:03:30]  And, you know, can I have finger prints, whatever.  And he has no problem with it.  You know, and, uh, I just, the one time I do, I did it, like, twice in my life.  I, uh, oh, no, three times.  I went to, uh, Kareem Adu-Jabbar to get Norton in order.  Kareem Adu.  We don't know who Kareem Adu-Jabbar is, Rich.  I do.  That must have been brutal, because I, I've heard that he's not the most cordial guy.  No, he's absolutely not.  Yeah.  Well, I walked up to Walt Frazier at a Knick game.  He was, yeah.  And I go, can you sign this hat? 
[02:04:00]  And I handed him the marker the wrong way, and I got it all over his hand.  Oh, lucky it was him.  He didn't notice it.  He was so pissed off, right?  You know.  That's great.  What an ass.  It's like, after shows, people go, can I take a picture with you?  And they come up to you, and they don't know how to fucking work their iPhones.  It drives me nuts. 
[02:04:30]  You know, look, look, can you fucking take the picture?  I'm trying to sell CDs, okay?  Obviously, I didn't hit bonus, so I need to make some kind of fucking money.  You and your fat fucking chick take the picture and move on, right?  How hard is it to work with a camera, okay?  If it was a car wreck, you'd have no problem videoing it and fucking putting it on Instagram.  I'm just picturing Rich coming up to Walt Frazier's waist.  Yeah.  And just handing him the marker.  Sharpie like a shank.  Oh, God. 
[02:05:00]  And ink all over his fingers.  He was so mad, and what I really wanted him to say is, look, just sign the fucking hat,  because, all right, nobody cares about you anymore, and to me, you aren't half as good  as Earl Monroe anyhow.  Why are you mad at him?  Because you put ink on him, and he didn't like it, and you're mad at him all the time.  I loved Earl Monroe, too, but fucking Frazier blew him away.  Are you kidding me?  You thought Frazier was better than Earl Monroe?  Absolutely.  Earl Monroe was a great schoolyard player, of course.  But I think Frazier was better, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  No.  I think Frazier was a good, you know, setup guard, but Earl Monroe was more fun to watch.  He was the point guard, of course.  I think we're getting off course here.  Yeah, I know.  My goodness.  Okay.  We had Dr. J in yesterday, Rich Voss.  What do you think of him?  Hey, Rich, who'd you like better, Otto Graham or Red Grange?  How fucking old are you?  I mean, that's why I watch basketball, you know. 
[02:06:00]  How old am I?  I'm quite old, Billy, and you shouldn't talk to your elders that way, okay?  Dude, I'm right behind you, man.  You got a couple good years, okay?  It's going to fucking end.  Believe me, it's going to end.  It's like your first fucking run where you had that dumb sitcom with Molly Ringwald.  You're walking around New York like you're the biggest one.  Jesus, Rich.  Wow.  Stop vomiting like your secret resentment.  I'm just trying to show this boy a little reality. 
[02:06:30]  It all fucking ends, okay?  So just have your shit in place, and remember, we were your fucking friends.  Dude, you sound like somebody in a townie bar.  Hey, don't forget where you came from.  Don't go changing on us.  Listen, Rich, I'm going to have my assistant send you my new cell phone number.  Please get one just to do that.  All right, Rich. 
[02:07:00]  All right, Rich.  Thank you, Rich.  You know, I just realized how unsanitary an apple is.  I tried to be healthy, and I said, yeah, can I have an apple?  I didn't even see the assistant.  I just see somebody's hand coming, trying to be, like, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, health conscious, like, daintedly holds it with two fingers and then sets it down on this table that God knows how many whores have sat on.  It's just like, is it worth?  You're eating the wrapper.  Yeah.  It's like an apple comes in the wrapper.  You're eating the fucking wrapper.  Do you wash it first?  Always wash your apple.  You've got to go wash it now.  Where am I going to wash it? 
[02:07:30]  Take a bathroom.  Always wash your apple.  It's disgusting right there.  Take a bottle of water and just dump some water over the apple.  Okay.  How about survival course?  Why not?  Jesus.  How about I just get one at the grocery store that's already been sneezed on?  Yeah, exactly.  You're a big sports guy.  We did have Dr. J in.  You know that he was...  I miss everything.  1987 is when he leaves the NBA.  Kenny's going to take care of it.  He just alleviated it.  He washes that skin between his balls and asshole.  He polishes it right there.  Paints it right up.  Do you know he only had $9 million when he left basketball? 
[02:08:00]  That's great.  Did he make a year?  So in 89?  He just missed the huge contracts.  I think his best year, he was making a couple.  Two mil or something like that.  Two to three mil tops.  He just missed out on those massive contracts.  Dude, he's a really gracious guy when it comes to photos and all that.  I think just about everybody I know has met him.  Great guy.  He gave me a picture.  Blah, blah, blah.  And I've never met that guy.  Yeah.  And he gave away a lot of money, apparently.  His friends and stuff. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  People would ask him for cash.  Business deals.  Well, he was also, I mean, he was basically, he was, he was Jordan before Jordan.  Like, he took, he brought the game above the rim and all, and like, but it was right  before the, I guess, bird magic.  Right?  Yeah.  They were both rookies when, yeah, he talked about them being rookies and cuttings.  He was just at the end when those guys were really taking off.  And then Jordan, of course.  And another guy that had no money was Bobby Orr.  You should know the Bobby Orr story, right?  He, he, when he left hockey. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no, yeah, no, his, his manager robbed him.  Totally fucked the guy.  Bobby Orr.  Horror story.  Some would argue the greatest.  He's a good basketball player.  Obviously, obviously, right up there, greatest hockey player of all time.  Wayne Gretzky says he's the best.  Yeah, absolutely.  He says that.  He had no money.  He got completely ripped off.  Yeah, no, it's brutal.  I, I hate what, that's why, when I used to watch those, those, uh, behind the musics,  I used to study those.  And you got the through line of how you get, you get, you get fucked over.  Uh, and one of the, one of the things I learned, never sign over power of attorney. 
[02:09:30]  Of course.  I never, I cringed.  How many, how many comics do you know that have, I got a business manager.  I haven't paid a, I haven't paid a bill in years.  And it's just like, well, I hope you got a good one.  Or you only give them access to one account and you know how much is in that account.  Or you just have them send you the checks and you sign them.  I sign all checks.  Sign all your own checks.  Fuck that.  That's why my, because you never know when they go bad, they could have started out as  a good guy.  Yeah.  And then some weird thing happens in their lives and then they get desperate. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  What's his face?  Uh, Vanilla Ice has one of the best behind the musics because he kept his money.  So his is easy to watch where he talks about the rise and the fall and everything as he's  sitting there with his pool behind him.  Because he's still got cash.  Yeah.  And he's also like a businessman.  He's got the construction business.  Oh yeah.  His was my favorite because I, you know, I don't want to see the guy, you know, putting  up billboards and whitewashing a fence or something.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I want to see you still have your money. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Who's the guy recently we talked about that runs a UPS store?  Oh, he's one of the singers from, um.  It killed us.  Yeah.  He's a singer from, someone will get it on PalTalk here in no time.  I mean, our fans go into the UPS store, not because they're fans of that guy, but because  they need their packets to be sent out.  No.  And it's this guy that used to be pretty damn famous.  Oh no.  It wasn't in.  It was even worse than that.  Now, working at a U, there's probably people listening who work at a UPS store. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  We're like, oh God, how does he do it?  I guess it's because you were, you were in this other place, but like, I don't know.  I guess I'm trying to spend it in a positive way.  Now they know they're in a shitty, no one at a UPS store thinks they're fucking a  chase manager.  They all know what they're doing.  No one's got it online?  Yeah, you're the reference points.  I'm very surprised.  It was a, it was like a fucking, um, it was some 80s band.  Didn't some band, someone went, a singer went and saw him. 
[02:11:30]  He was, fuck dude, not Duran Duran.  Man, he was, the guy came to his door and, and it was like, Hey, you're the guy from  band.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I don't know.  Bobby Orr.  Yeah.  Had no, how did he make his money then?  Cause he's doing okay.  Hey, I would say personal appearances and like, I mean, that guy, he's, uh, he's one of those  guys that's just like timeless.  Like everybody's going to always want to see, always want to see him.  Like the greats in that game too.  By the way, hockey is just the greatest sport ever.  I was watching a game six of the world series. 
[02:12:00]  I was such a bandwagon Red Sox fan.  Like the first two games I watched this year was, uh, game one and game two.  Well, I mean, I, I got with all the roids, the pink hats, it just wasn't the team that  I came up with.  It was just, just baseball was, look, I always use A-Rod as, as the thing when I would watch  roids on, uh, ESPN.  It was like, A-Rod went from, you know, you know, this, this rookie sensation to, uh, was,  he's one of the great shortstops potentially of all time. 
[02:12:30]  And then he became, he's a cheater, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, he's a piece of garbage.  And then he comes back and then they're like, the countdown to 600 home runs.  And it's just like, I, it's like, what side of the fence are you on with this guy?  And then he became a cheater again.  I was just like, you know, so I kind of got away.  So anyways, I'm watching game six and we're up like four to one and I still switched over  and I watched the, the Penguins Bruins, which was one of the best regular season games  I've seen in a long time. 
[02:13:00]  And just like, right as I put it on, there was a fight off of the face off.  And one of the guys in the Penguins, one of those guys who gets into fights and he's  looking away and he's like smiling, you know, like total psycho.  I think Pasquale Dupree like pulled a tooth out of his mouth.  You saw that?  Yes, I did.  Didn't miss a shift.  Right.  And it was just, it was way more exciting.  The tooth was in the way.  So he just pulled it out.  And October regular season game was way more exciting than game six of the World Series.  I wish I got, I want to love hockey.  Have you ever gone to a hockey game? 
[02:13:30]  No.  See that, that'll turn you.  I went last night.  It was, it was.  You went to the right.  How's the new Madison Square Garden?  It's pretty cool.  It's cool.  But like, I'm a sentimental jackass.  I want to be, no, have it still look like when Zeppelin was here.  Right, right.  But, you know, up top, they still have the iconic roof.  But I kind of like what they did.  It reminds me of the Superdome in New Orleans.  Like, they redid that one.  I went to that one like two times before they redid it.  And it was, it was cool in an old sort of dumpy way. 
[02:14:00]  But now that's one, like the Superdome now is like one of the best arenas in the league.  Wow, I didn't know that.  No, it's awesome.  Once they pull a body off the fucking 20-yard line, they have to really soup to join up.  At that point, you kind of got to redo the whole building.  You got to spray wash the whole building.  You got to get that smell out of there.  But, yeah, I like it.  But they have those glass seats or whatever that are above the ice or the court at Madison Square Garden.  I still don't understand how that works.  Did you see it?  I had really good seats.  I was at that level where you're in the middle of the ice and you're just above the board. 
[02:14:30]  So you could potentially get killed by a party.  So I was really paying attention.  So you weren't looking around.  Because I was not going to be that guy texting or looking.  I did look up and I noticed that the levels were different.  But, I mean, I grew up in Boston.  So I've been to Madison Square Garden.  But not as much as a New Yorker who would remember.  Right, okay.  I knew it was different.  But I liked it.  Getting nailed by a puck would be fucking terrible.  That's got to be horrible.  That's got to be worse than a baseball.  Getting hit by a puck with equipment on, that's no picnic. 
[02:15:00]  Right, right.  Really.  And then you're just sitting in the stands, not looking.  If you're putting a puck in the skate, it's like, if a guy like Chara, they said it's  like getting shot by a .38 caliber.  Like your bones can shatter in your foot.  So there's actually this guy who makes these things called skate fenders.  Yeah.  That you need to put on.  Really, yeah.  Put on, so any hockey players out there, if the dream has died and you're still playing  pickup hockey and you don't want to limp into your cubicle, I wear them when I play. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, what is it, like Kevlar, fucking?  They're just a piece of plastic.  Like that area and then the back of your calves.  Like once a game, somebody gets slashed, it seems, to the back of the calf.  And then the announcer always says, I'll tell you, there's not a lot of protection back  there.  Everyone is just like, well, why don't you make some?  Yeah, how about we make some?  Yeah, why don't we patent like a 360 degree protection?  Because there's also times, you know, you're following your guy down the ice and somebody's  like, you know, trying to shoot it into the zone and you'll get hit in the back of the 
[02:16:00]  leg.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And when you bruise in your 40s, that thing lasts for like three months.  It doesn't go away as fast.  It turns fucking black and yellow and purple.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I fell on a rock hiking in Boulder, Colorado, dude.  And somebody said, it looks like you got hit by a fastball.  And it bruised so bad, the middle of it never, like, it was black.  It was black in the middle, never went fully purple.  It was just this disgusting, like, yellow. 
[02:16:30]  I can't, it looked like I got shot or something.  Holy fuck.  We got to go all in with stem cells.  Because now that I have kids, I mean, a kid will get a, will heal in one day.  It is creepy to watch a kid heal.  Oh, yeah.  No.  We got to go all in.  Like vampire healing.  They're like X-Men.  Absolutely.  Like Wolverine healing.  Yeah.  They could get a fucking bump on their head and by dinner it's gone and they're completely.  All I know is if I have any sort of problem, the new place that seems to go, where all  the athletes are going, is you go to Germany. 
[02:17:00]  The blood thing in Germany.  Yeah.  Rogan was telling me about that.  Yeah.  Rogan White told us about it and Kobe Bryant has gone there.  They spin your blood.  Rogan's doing something.  He said he got a bunch of blood pulled.  What was his injury?  Because he's having it spin, spun.  He didn't have an injury.  He was just like.  No, no, no.  He did.  Did he?  He had a, I don't want to talk out of school.  Ask him.  He had some sort of, I can't figure out what it was.  But did he?  Or is it one thing like how you get medical marijuana?  You're just like, yeah, I'm injured.  They probably want to see how a person can survive with that much fucking pot in the system. 
[02:17:30]  Which is not normal.  A person can function and do a podcast and have a career with this much dolphin.  To be that cerebral.  He really like knocks down all stereotypes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of the brawny guy, yeah.  Yeah, the brawny, well-read guy that can converse.  Renaissance man.  Yes, a renaissance man.  And he can just pick up a boulder as he's doing it.  Yeah.  With a pot, like lollipop in his mouth.  But then you see him in his private life.  He's just shitting his plants.  And he's banging blocks up and down. 
[02:18:00]  He's got to come out somehow, right?  He's making that noise.  Soiling himself.  He's shitting his plants.  No, he was telling me about, like, Peyton Manning.  I think Peyton Manning went out there.  Like, I'm really kind of talking out of school.  Yeah, no, a lot of the athletes are going there.  Like, in Germany, he's spitting their blood.  Colts just got rid of him, like, the way the Raiders got rid of Bo Jackson.  Where, like, it's like, are you sure you know what they're doing?  And then, like, Bo Jackson was done.  It's like, wow, he must have just had it.  Colts did the same thing with Peyton Manning.  And Peyton Manning, you come back and you're just like, you're like brand new.  That's fucked up.  I mean, I'm sure he still, like, you know, hurts like hell after the end of the games. 
[02:18:30]  But, like, I don't know.  He does not look like he had some sort of potentially career-ending injury.  Huh.  I don't want to jinx the guy either.  That's fucked up, man.  How are your Patriots getting the job done this year, though?  Tom Brady is having one of the best years of his career.  And, like, he has that thing where he makes people around him better.  Better, right.  The thing that I would say a guy like Kobe doesn't do.  No, of course not.  As great as Kobe is.  Well, we got one of those guys on our team, Carmelo Anthony. 
[02:19:00]  Doesn't make anyone better around him.  We're never going to win a championship with him.  Oh, you think so?  They're having a horrendous season, too.  Fuck them.  Fuck the Knicks.  You know what kills me, though?  Because Celtics finally won last night.  They're 1-4.  So when they were 0-4, I'm already looking at next year's draft.  I'm like, all right, I'm trying to get a positive.  Okay, so maybe there's some beast coming out.  And I looked up Sports Illustrated's top ten.  NBA draft picks for next year.  And eight out of ten are freshmen.  And then the other two are sophomores because everybody comes out now.  So basically the senior and junior classes have been so, like, just pilfered that there's nobody left in those. 
[02:19:30]  And I remember back in the day, a guy would come out four years under Coach K.  And you had such a foundation that they, or Dean Smith and all those great coaches back in the day.  Now they're just coming out like, you're basically going to draft a 19-year-old.  Yeah.  Who, 24 months earlier, was playing in high school.  And this is the guy who's supposed to go out there and go up against Tim Duncan.  Right.  Who's not going to school him, you know, 26 ways to Sunday, however that fucking expression goes. 
[02:20:00]  One more thing about sports and then we can move on to other things.  By the way, Bill Burr playing the Beacon Theater this Friday.  Can I talk about that Flyers goalie incident?  I didn't see.  They're making all that big deal about it.  The goalies fought.  One didn't want to fight.  Weren't we talking about that when the goalies went at it?  Oh, it was.  We have the whole thing on this.  It's hilarious when goalies fight.  It's like, how can you be mad at a guy that is all the way on the other side? 
[02:20:30]  They're further away from each other.  They've had no incident.  No, but everybody's talking.  Like, whenever an incident like that happens, all the people who don't watch hockey come  out of the woodwork to talk about what's wrong with the sport and what they should do to  improve the sport so that they can then continue to not watch hockey.  It drives me up the wall.  Yeah, then they go away.  The thing is, though, if you watch that brawl at full speed, it doesn't look that bad.  You slow it down, it looks like Passion of the Christ.  I'm out of this one.  I didn't see this.  It's just a classic line brawl. 
[02:21:00]  There's Simmons holding his own against a bruiser.  Oh, yeah, but kids are going to see this.  Hopi's like the European guy, like, I don't want to do this, man.  What problem do these two guys have?  No, they talked a lot of shit before the game.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Wow.  He's getting whipped. 
[02:21:30]  All right, now look at him at the end of the fight.  Well, this has been going on.  There's been a lot of time.  Oh, shit.  They're down.  All right.  This is awesome.  This is trading with Alexi.  And now Shen going at it as well with Erbam.  And it's a line brawl for sure here at Wells Fargo Center.  I love the lefts.  I love the lefts when they grab them in the jersey and get those little ones in.  Those pokes.  Do these guys not like each other? 
[02:22:00]  God.  That's great.  How can you not like this?  Basically, the Flyers were losing seven to nothing.  Right.  Shen goes down as Erbam lines up.  So what's the problem?  They're saying that Emery, he went down, he should be in jail for what he did.  Oh, God, please.  Right.  Is he going to be suspended?  What they do is they show him punching the guy in the back of the head.  Basically donkey punching him.  But they kept showing it in slow motion.  And even I, as a hockey fan, was like, oh, my God, that's horrible. 
[02:22:30]  And I watched it in fast motion.  I was just like, oh, that's just kind of awesome.  Right.  Oh, that's awesome.  God, I love hockey.  Yeah, man.  I like that part.  Wow, that was a good knockdown.  The hits in hockey are just amazing.  Is that how it started right there?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Wait, now Wayne Simmons is more like a finesse player.  Right.  He doesn't fight usually.  This is how you psych your team up.  Who's the tougher?  The guy in the orange right there?  No, the other guy.  Why, because he's black?  Was he black? 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  Oh, Simmons is black.  Huh.  They were already fighting way down.  I mean, each team has, what, one guy now?  Maybe two guys?  They've incorporated, like, that no-touch icing now.  The game is...  Don't fuck with it.  Yeah, one of the best it could ever be.  Just don't fuck with it.  Leave it alone.  Yeah, I'm sick of these people who, like, keep lying that if they did this, this, and this,  I would watch.  It's like, you wouldn't.  No.  Those are some execution-looking blows that he was doing to the back of his head.  He's, like, got him on his knees, and he's like, finish him. 
[02:23:30]  That's, like, one of those fucking moves.  Did you guys see the brawl at the Red Sox parade?  No.  No, I heard about that, though.  Oh, my God.  That's one of those YouTube videos where you have to sign in and just say, are you 18?  Oh, wait.  Is that the one where the guy gets fucking, like, stomped on the head?  Oh, it's brutal.  And shit.  What was the problem there?  Oh, it's just, you know...  Just that the Red Sox won?  Is it some way...  No, it has nothing to do with it.  That's why I love it.  Yeah, yeah.  People go, oh, real classy, boss, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Way to keep it classy.  It's like, yeah, okay, New York, Philly.  Right.  Like, you wouldn't do the same shit. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, like, yeah, where...  I always feel safe when I walk around, you know, in those cities.  Come on.  It's basically, you know...  It's that awful thing where two people are fighting, and it's basically why you never  get into a street fight, because there's no rules, there's no third man in, there's  no time limit, there's no refs, there's no illegal moves, it's just like...  Everything goes.  It's like you're winning a fight, and all of a sudden, somebody just from behind punches 
[02:24:30]  you in the head.  You don't even know what happened.  You're knocked out, there's no ref to wave it off.  So somebody can step on your head, and...  You don't ever do this.  Oh, this is how injuries happen.  Is this the one where the black guy gets punched?  Is it the one where the black guy gets knocked out?  I hope not.  I saw...  Yeah.  Yeah, he gets knocked out, and then a white guy gets knocked out.  Dude, there's this one guy in a green shirt who knows his role, who realizes he's not  the one-on-one guy, so he keeps doing these giant circle-like loops, and I think he wore 
[02:25:00]  his sneakers out.  Is he with any of them, or just being a scumbag?  Oh, shit.  I have no idea, but all these guys are going to get caught.  Is this it?  Yeah.  This is several KOs and curb stomping.  It's crazy.  And then they're going to attribute it to Red Sox fans, which is funny, because I don't  know what we are at this point.  Do we wear pink hats?  What is it?  I can't see, Sam.  Make it bigger.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  It's like I got a frying pan.  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:25:30]  It's the guy in the green.  Okay, that guy...  There's a chick trying to keep one of the guys down.  Chicks are brave, man.  Chicks are stupid.  They're really dumbies.  Here we go.  All right, and two guys fighting.  We're all going on.  Don't jump in.  Don't jump in.  Don't jump in.  And now you got three on one.  They're pulling the other guy out. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that dude.  They're doing the Paul Pierce.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  He's out.  He's out.  Now he's like...  The guy's knocked out.  They're all falling all over him.  What is that with punching a guy that's already fucking knocked out?  I don't even have one.  Two other guys are fighting now.  Oh, this guy is knocked out.  Some guys are helping him.  Yeah, that guy is done.  Ah, he's just fucking shoot him right in the face. 
[02:26:30]  He kicked the guy in the face.  There he goes again.  That was him again.  Another stomp.  What up the Paul Pierce?  This kid, I swear to God, is like...  What a dick.  Yeah, it's very Ken Lindsman.  Now they're carrying the black guy away that's still fucking knocked out on his feet.  That guy's...  That guy's really fucked up.  Now here comes the curvy.  Where's the guy in the fucking green?  There he is.  There he is.  Knocked out.  Knocked out.  Oh, no. 
[02:27:00]  No.  Yeah, now he got...  He's dragging.  Move.  Now watch this.  Yeah, this guy's winning.  Winning.  Yeah, look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  He's winning.  And then, look, they just knock...  Holy shit.  Foot to the back of the head.  The Paul Pierce dude was finally...  Had a one-on-one.  The chick is protecting him now.  Oh, boy. 
[02:27:30]  How degrading.  He's got a curb stomped, dude.  He's got a curb stomped, dude.  He's got a curb stomped, dude.  Dude, he fucking got a curb stomped.  Dude, this kid's dead.  Yes, kid.  Is everyone all right?  No.  No.  No, that's not all right.  Dude, you don't...  You don't...  No.  That kid is like...  In bad shape.  Dude, you're talking like, you know, you could have...  Yeah, permanent brain damage.  That's going to be like, there's going to be probably an attempted murder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't do stuff like that. 
[02:28:00]  He's got his head smashed in the concrete, right?  Right.  That fucking stomp thing, that's also the rage now.  Now, if they were all on skates and they were refs, I wouldn't have a problem with that.  Right.  There you go.  I'm such a hypocrite.  One thing that I do notice, though, when crazy white kids are beating the shit out of each  other, when the guy's down, there's no rifling through their pockets for the cell phones.  Anytime you watch a World Star hip-hop video and you get a bunch of black guys fighting,  the second someone goes down, rifle through the pockets... 
[02:28:30]  They're very thorough.  Yes.  They want to make sure it's thorough.  It's physical and financial.  Yes.  They want to make sure...  They want to make sure he hasn't broken anything.  They're probably trying to be helpful.  Yes.  You hope this guy's phone's okay.  Crazy shit.  Wow, that's fucking brutal, man.  That's tough to say.  That is.  That stomp thing is really hard to watch.  What's the brain thing they call this?  Is the abbreviation a fucking TMI?  Headache?  No.  Guy who offers bed health.  This is supposed to be us on the $20,000 pyramid.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Just bombing her brain thing.  Brain thing.  Yeah, so things that happened in Dallas in 1963.  Wait, no.  It was a traumatic...  Pneumonia.  A traumatic...  Nausea.  T-something-I.  TBI.  Traumatic brain injury.  No, I thought it was traumatic.  It might be a TBI.  Pass.  Pass.  Pass.  Yeah, this SUV guy.  How many cars did he end up hitting?  This thing's going viral today.  This guy, he stole the SUV. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  And then he hit a cab.  Right.  And when he was trying to do a hit and run...  What is this, GTA?  But then they blocked him in.  Great graphics.  So on his way out, he hit, like, six more cars trying to escape.  That'll happen.  Yeah, you can't box a guy in like that.  Let me see.  What do you think he's going to do?  Just give up?  Let me see what it'll look like.  All right, he's, uh...  Some guy's blocking him.  That's the cab driver blocking him.  Oh, boy.  Because he hit his cab.  Oh, and now he's like, no, you're...  Then he goes...  He starts trying to smash the window.  So the guy panics.  Peels out.  Oh, he hit a car.  Hits another tank. 
[02:30:00]  Back up, back up.  Hits up.  Back up.  Uh-oh.  And he backs...  Why is he backing up that far?  He's an asshole.  What a idiot.  He's a panicky Pete.  Now he's going forward again.  He really is panicky.  He's going forward.  Oh, what are you doing, dude?  You suck.  Wow.  I wonder if he's drunk or fucked.  There's got to be a reason he's trying so hard to get away from.  Oh, he's a kid.  Stolen car.  Right.  Oh, is it?  Okay.  Yeah, the SUV he's driving is stolen.  Is that it?  Yeah, then he gets out of here.  He's got to go to the fucking...  Where's that?  That's in Chicago.  Chicago.  He's not a good driver at all.  He's got to go to that paint place now in GTA where you go in the garage, get your car 
[02:30:30]  redone, and then you come out and no more stars.  Right.  It's all good.  And the car is perfect.  Yep.  Did they get the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, they got him.  I just realized we just did like 10 minutes of radio watching.  It happens.  It's less than normal.  Yeah.  It happens.  We've watched the entire episode.  We've gone through moment shunts.  Oh, this is a good old man reference.  Moment shunts.  Oh, no, there were mimes.  It used to be a show that was on...  You know something, Sam?  Punch up moment shunts commercial. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know what's amazing?  Back in the...  I remember in the 70s, there was this famous mime that would always get on...  Marcel Marceau?  You get on like the Mike Douglas show.  Yeah, a mime.  And I would watch it with my mom and we used to be just...  It was amazing.  He was trapped in the box.  He was going down the escalator.  He was pulling the rope.  Yeah.  How did they do that?  It was because it was pretty like Michael Jackson.  So those mimes were amazing.  This was mime and shunts on the Muppet show.  They're performance artists.  Uh-huh.  They were like Blue Man Group before Blue Man Group. 
[02:31:30]  But they didn't do anything cool.  No.  See, they...  See, they have like little...  I was laughing.  We're now just watching little things.  They're lifting the things.  They make it look like they're wanking at each other.  It's really terrible.  I just remember the commercial was creepy as a kid.  Right.  It would be on like Channel 11.  Can you find the commercial, Sam?  I don't like the sound behind it.  Why do they have dirty fucking feet?  Yeah, blind and bare feet.  Yeah, why did they...  Because they're 1976.  Yeah, dirty Portland hippies.  And they're filthy hippies.  Exactly.  Momen Chant's commercial.  Monsanto.  Momen Chant's.  Yeah.  A unique creation. 
[02:32:00]  A fun-filled fantasia, says the New York Times.  Exceptional ingenuity and exciting possibilities in an all-new show.  Momen Chant's marvelous...  What is the exciting possibility?  Maybe it won't suck.  Yeah.  ...for original adventure and theater and dance.  They're like clay people.  Yeah.  They're magic clay people.  It is illuminating.  I remember the toilet paper eyeballs.  Charge at 944-9300.  The Helen Hayes Theater.  Yes.  Whatever happened to that?  Call it.  It seems like that could work still today. 
[02:32:30]  They were probably beaten by people demanding a refund.  Right.  You'd have to be on drugs to enjoy that.  Yeah.  That was like some kind of a fucking...  That was way out there back then.  It's so good.  If you had that show in like the 1800s and you went to some saloon, how quickly before  you'd get shot?  Oh, you'd just be fucking laid open.  Kill for witchcraft?  Yeah.  Bill's also got a take on the pink in the NFL.  I don't have a take.  It's just some stuff I read on the internet that...  Well, that's a...  Not a lot of money was...  Not a lot of money is going to the actual cause, right? 
[02:33:00]  A lot of overhead, as they say.  Of course, you know, all the players wearing pink to support breast cancer.  Yeah.  And I guess how it works out is it's...  They give a percentage of the wholesale cost of whatever the item costs to make.  Yeah.  So you pay $100 for a jersey, whatever the jersey costs them.  You know, when they say the jersey costs them $10 to make.  And then they give 2% of that.  So you're talking like...  So not a lot of money is going to the cause.  They give it, say, a dollar from it. 
[02:33:30]  And then it goes into the pink lady's place.  And then she's got to get paid.  And everybody else has to get paid.  It's the same.  Yeah, yeah.  They make really good salaries.  Yeah.  They get a nice taste when you run a charity.  Yeah, but you know something?  This is the deal.  How did you not know it was that?  Yeah, yeah.  I just assumed.  I just assumed the second they did it, this was the NFL trying to get more female fans.  Whenever you throw cancer into it, you think people are being legit.  Because who would fuck somebody out of a cancer benefit?  And then they justify it by saying, hey, we're giving something.  What are you doing?  Well, in the end, the number will probably be kind of impressive. 
[02:34:00]  I just would love to just be sitting in some giant house like, how did you get this?  It's breast cancer.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  People really like to give to this horrible disease to cure it.  The misery of other people.  Yeah.  Right.  And I gave myself a raise for running the foundation.  The hopes and dreams of the terminally ill bought me this house.  Absolutely.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, pictures of Bubba Smith, Peter, Chris, Olivia Newton-John, everybody who suffered.  That's your tribute.  Fucking shitheads. 
[02:34:30]  Not them.  This person.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  The big pink movement.  Why don't we...  I got to piss.  Yeah, we should take a break.  Bill Burr's here.  Bill Burr on Twitter.  The podcast is amazing.  The Monday Morning Podcast is still going strong.  We got our...  Me and Al Madrigal and some other folks started a podcast network.  I read that.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  The All Things Comedy Network.  Good for you.  Yeah, it's more of a co-op.  You're in.  I just, as always, you know, artists come up with stuff or whatever.  New technology comes along and artists use it and then they create a new scene and then 
[02:35:00]  the businessman comes in.  The fucking man.  The man comes in.  And then they...  They take it all.  Yeah, and they go, all right, we're going to own your show.  But you're going to get this great exposure.  So we were like, why don't we just get all the podcasts we like, get together, and for  once, the artists keep the money.  Fucking nice.  It's like United Artists.  So it started out that way.  With Charlie Chaplin.  Right.  We started that shit.  We're trying to beat the man so we can become the man.  That's right.  And then we're going to have pink podcast microphones.  Yeah.  And we're all going to get into big houses.  But we got... 
[02:35:30]  There we go.  That's cool, man.  Ari Shaffir.  We got The Naughty Show.  We got Minivan Men.  We got a bunch of stuff.  Monday Morning Podcasts.  Come to Papa.  Oh.  Come to Papa's on your network.  Come to Papa.  Wow.  Very good.  Our network.  Tell Tom I'm tired of that dumb looking off to the right picture.  I fucking had enough of him looking like there's something happening over there.  It was a gunshot he was hearing.  These podcast networks are like the mob. 
[02:36:00]  They're like the new mafia families.  You got a podcast family together.  Carlin's Highway.  Oh, yeah.  You got Baron Vaughn's on there.  Deep shit with Baron Vaughn.  We got...  You got a lot of shows.  We got something for everybody.  We got a podcast too now, Bill.  Thanks.  An hour a week we throw out there for the people.  If you would like to come on.  For the people.  We did a Bill Burr podcast.  Some of the stuff you did on our show.  That one did really well, by the way.  So thank you.  No worries.  This week's podcast...  I'll be looking for that check. 
[02:36:30]  This week's podcast came out yesterday, right?  That was a joke.  Yeah.  Bill Burr fucking looking to get paid.  Fuck him.  You'll still hear it.  You changed, man.  You fucking changed.  Boo hoo Bill Hollywood.  The asshole.  This week's podcast.  Tim Conway?  Yeah.  We had Tim Conway in here.  What an asshole.  Oh, my God.  You did?  In a good way.  Oh, he was great.  But what an asshole.  He was great.  Intimidating as all hell.  He was fun, though.  He was a complete old school ball breaker.  Yeah.  Like, Colin sent me a picture of his book with fucking, like, because it's called What's 
[02:37:00]  So Funny with him looking up in the other direction.  And Colin just sent a photo of his book with Ugg.  It's a call.  So, we got the great Tim Conway interview.  That was amazing.  And what else is on this week's podcast?  John Valby down at the piano store.  Oh, right.  The John Valby would want to add to that.  Oh, yeah.  At the Steinway.  Yeah.  And then...  Hey, so, Tim Conway was just, like, breaking your balls the whole time?  Yeah.  Well, you just wanted to hide.  Yeah.  He dismissed Brian Regan.  Brian Regan was in here, asked a question. 
[02:37:30]  He dismissed him.  And Brian didn't want to speak anymore.  He told him to go back to listening.  Oh, it was unbelievable.  And he was just like...  But he was joking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He came in, making believe, like, he's slow or something.  He didn't know where he was.  And he stood right there.  I'm pointing for the people at home behind Anthony.  The worst place you could stand in the studio when you're supposed to be interviewed.  And just stood there awkwardly waiting for us to say something.  And then we finally went, because we think he's an old man.  We're like, oh, you know, there, sit over there.  And he was saying something about Jackie Gleason.  And then Jimmy went, like, oh, Jackie Gleason. 
[02:38:00]  And he goes, who?  Who?  And Jimmy's ready to go, oh, Jackie Gleason.  And then we're like, no, he's fucking with you.  He's not senile at all.  It was amazing.  It was really good.  It was amazing.  He was such a fucking old school prick.  It was great.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  Oh.  We got a break?  We should, yeah.  All right.  Let's break, then.  All right.  We're going to break.  So go get our podcast.  It's out there.  It's on our Facebook page, the link and all that.  All right?  It's another good one this week.  More with Bill Burr.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:38:30]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continuous.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continuous.  Oh, yeah.  Back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, Anthony and Sam show for the time being.  So, I guess, starstruck Opie, Jimmy Norton, and even Bill Burr, who is a star in his own 
[02:39:00]  right these days, they're down the hall because Bill Cosby is here.  The cause.  And they want a picture with him.  But apparently there's a giant line of people that have to get a picture with Bill Cosby.  And they got on that line?  There was at one point a big line.  Yeah.  And they were at the end of it.  But I'm guessing they're getting escorted through or not.  There's a photo opportunity.  I'm surprised you didn't go down for the big photo. 
[02:39:30]  I could give a shit about the cause.  Burr.  Hey, Rudy.  Burr.  Oh, here comes Kenny.  Kenny's got an update.  What's up, Kenny?  What's going on down the hall?  Well, they were standing in line like second-class citizens.  Yeah.  So, I got somebody to approve for them to cut the line.  So, they have an audience now with Mr. Cosby.  How did that work out with the rest of the people online?  They must not have been happy. 
[02:40:00]  Well, my first request was denied.  And then I went to somebody else and they realized...  Who are the people that are online?  Yeah.  Subscribers have to be taken care of.  They pay our salary.  Right.  God.  Why not take care of them by having a website that works?  Having a fucking radio that doesn't just stop playing whatever you're listening to.  Yeah, maybe you could enjoy Art Bell then.  Yeah.  Well, Art Bell would have been here.  You don't like Bill Cosby?  No.  Why not?  Ugh.  Back in the fucking, like, 70s. 
[02:40:30]  I guess he was relevant.  I could give a shit about Bill Cosby.  You don't think the Cosby show was relevant?  Oh, wow.  What kind of fantasy is that?  Was that show considered science fiction?  Please.  You know what I'm talking about.  Doctors and lawyers don't end up getting married?  Yeah, exactly.  Doctors and lawyers.  And kids that are perfect without any fucking problems.  Why would they have problems?  Well, you know.  Please.  That was pretty cool.  That was a little Bill Cosby action. 
[02:41:00]  That was pretty cool.  What's Jimmy still fucking down there lapping Cosby ass?  Was it?  Oh, wait, Bill.  What happened?  He saw how, like, nervous Jim, he goes, he's like, where are you working?  And Jim's like, where are you working tonight?  And then he goes, the comedy seller.  And he goes, you see how quick that came to you?  And Jimmy just goes, yeah, I know.  I was just nervous.  I was just nervous.  He goes, that's why I asked you again.  Oh, no.  No, he knows that people get, like, Jimmy all fucking nervous now. 
[02:41:30]  Dude, it's Bill Cosby.  Yeah.  That's a biggie.  Come on, man.  That's the, uh.  That's a biggie.  I said last night when I met him, I said, this is like meeting the Pope.  He goes, yeah, except way more entertaining.  Ah, yeah.  Okay.  Guess who Ant's not a big fan of?  Cosby?  The Cos.  No.  You're not a fan of Bill Cosby?  No, no.  I'm a fan.  I just don't need a picture.  When I was just a young nothing, I'd listen to Bill Cosby records.  My brother Leonard album. 
[02:42:00]  Russell.  Russell.  I wasn't a fan of the Cosby show or any of that shit.  You're thinking Leonard Part 6.  Right.  That was a great movie.  That was a good movie.  And Ghost Dad.  All right.  Good Lord.  He's still a legend.  Jesus.  I was just thinking, like, can we just somehow have a positive fucking moment on the goddamn  show?  Please.  Please.  It always has to be knocked down a shit.  All the stuff that that guy did, it's just, it's like, you know what I hope?  I hope at the end of your career, they play those clips of you when you first started 
[02:42:30]  working.  Oh, the horrible fucking...  The ones that make you pull your winter coat over your face.  Yes.  Yes.  They bring that up.  What moment of fairness did I just miss?  I came in...  Wait a minute.  Any time.  Any time.  Remember that?  Yes, I do.  What did I just miss?  Because I came in...  It's trash and Cosby is what you missed.  To have Kenny telling me, who wouldn't let us cut the law, you know?  We were trying to say what a great experience that was, and within two seconds, he brings  up...  I was shitting on it.  He brings up Leonard Part Six.  Leonard Part Six and Ghost Dad. 
[02:43:00]  Well, yeah, all right.  So he wasn't always an Oscar winner, but he's still, uh...  What about the Uptown Saturday Night and all the fucking things he did?  Cosby's amazing, man.  I like the Eye Spy.  But...  The Eye Spy was a good show.  While you were out of the room, and...  Robert Culp.  Right.  And said Cosby hadn't been relevant since the 70s.  Well...  Oh, my God.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  You would change your tune if you just met him.  He couldn't have been nicer.  That's not true, either, because he's actually quoted a lot in...  He's the one saying, you can't be a doctor talking like this, and he was criticizing that  fucking element of the black community. 
[02:43:30]  I heard you were a nervous little Nelly in front of him.  Yeah, but I made him laugh.  That's all that matters.  Yeah?  Of course.  Yeah, he laughed.  That was great.  Yeah.  He absolutely laughed.  He's a great, positive moment.  He addressed me, and I didn't say anything.  How dare you?  He asked me where I worked.  How dare you, sir?  Or ruin our little fanboy moment.  I'm not going to ruin it.  That's wonderful.  He asked me where I worked, and I just panicked and didn't say anything.  Because he was looking, and he goes, Norton.  And I'm like, oh, I told him I panicked.  Oh, you did.  Fucking idiot.  Come on.  But he likes you to sit really close to him.  Yeah.  I thought I was sitting close enough, and he made me scoot in even more. 
[02:44:00]  You scooted in on him?  I felt his warm butt cheek.  Oh, nice.  We were butt cheek to butt cheek.  I had to push to open again.  He was going to take the...  You don't take the three shot.  You always get the four.  I don't care.  I like being in the three shot with you guys.  Two, my friends, but I mean, four officially with Mr. Cosby.  Did you get the solo shot?  Yeah, but you got it.  Because, again, it's Bill Cosby.  His eye is a little...  Yeah.  You know, he's had some issues, but...  He always has something going on with that eye.  He's got some sarcoma or something, right?  That eye was always a little joke.  Are we doing it again, Bill?  I'm sorry.  I swear to God, you guys could literally be sitting, staring at a bag of a million dollars 
[02:44:30]  and be like, hey, that's a burlap?  Really?  How come it's on a nylon sack?  It's just fucking...  Bill really hits us with reality when he comes in.  You guys are like so habitually fucking negative.  It's unbelievable.  It's insane.  Holy fuck.  I can't argue with you.  You're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.  I mean, dude, I'm not exactly Mr. Sunshine here.  And it's just like, I am astounded.  When I come in here, I don't give a fuck what just happened. 
[02:45:00]  He's right.  I know.  I can't argue that.  But I don't know why we do that.  I'm not going to say his name, but everybody's going to know.  But that dude came in.  He gave you a killer hour of radio.  And he had some sort of bladder control problem.  And then in the end, you took the pictures and you pointed at the wet stain in his crotch.  It was just like this guy just destroyed.  That's one of the greatest shots ever.  Not only did they take a photo with him, when they do signings, that's their promo photo. 
[02:45:30]  But Iron Sheik signed it and he actually, he signed my picture and he put in, Iron Sheik  drew an arrow down to the piss stain.  He doesn't mind that.  Yeah, but that's your promo shot now that you hand out to everybody to say this is the show.  I just look at him and say, that's the Iron Sheik, man.  Show us some respect.  Let's try to go belt buckle high.  You guys just zooming into it, pointing at it.  It's all said and done.  I met Bill Cosby today and I'll be pretty excited about that, Bill.  He's a nice man, isn't he?  He's a nice man. 
[02:46:00]  He's sitting behind you.  He doesn't just rush you through.  He could have told everybody to fuck off.  He takes his time.  What do we got here?  Out of BC.  Out of BC.  Out of BC.  Who's that?  You might remember him from Lost.  He was Mr. Echo on the show Lost.  You might remember him from Oz.  He was out of BC.  Right.  From Oz.  Jesus.  That's one of the rare things to try to do is get into two shows where you win the championship.  You go to syndication.  Right? 
[02:46:30]  That's huge.  Very few have ever done three.  Three?  When you get three, you're talking to a guy like Lee Majors.  Wow.  Yeah.  Lee Majors was on Big Valley.  Yes.  Six million dollar man.  Yep.  And then the one where he was a stunt guy.  Yeah.  I just.  The fall guy.  The fall guy.  Shatner did it too.  Heather Locklear might be on four.  She's Shatner too.  Shatner.  She's a three.  Star Trek.  Heather Locklear is like the Bill Russell or Yogi Berra. 
[02:47:00]  She's got more championships than fingers.  90210.  Right.  Or the other one.  She was on TJ Hooker.  TJ Hooker.  Wow.  Yeah.  Before he comes in.  Because he's going to come in a couple minutes.  How is the Kevin Costner thing?  And when does that movie come out?  Oh, yeah.  It's called Black and White.  It starred Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer.  Jesus.  Directed by Mike Binder.  And we shot it down in New Orleans.  And I had a great time.  Other than the most unbelievable humidity I've ever been in my life.  A little sticky. 
[02:47:30]  A little damp.  It was.  But I had an awesome time.  And everybody was.  Yeah.  It's a dumb question.  How cool is Costner?  We went bow fishing the last night.  No kidding.  Out in the bayou.  Come on.  She taught me how to do it.  And I shot this thing called an alligator gar.  Oh, yeah.  The gars.  Something like that.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  Those things are scary looking.  It was.  Yeah.  It was pretty.  Jesus Christ.  I hear you're in a lot of the movie.  Well, look, dude.  It's not out yet.  Look at Bill.  It's not out yet.  So there's a lot. 
[02:48:00]  Because things can happen.  Oh, yeah.  Some editing and shit.  Things get cut and stuff.  Like, I know a guy.  He had, like, two huge scenes with Al Pacino.  And he told everybody.  Oh, no.  And then, you know, they're cutting it down, cutting it down, cutting it down.  And then they just cut his whole storyline.  Yeesh.  And that happens all the freaking time.  So, man.  It's not something they don't tell you.  Like, they should at least let you know.  What director said they were going to start letting people know?  Like, hey, man, you didn't make it in.  This way you don't go there with your friends or whatever.  Hey, look.  I'm in this movie.  And then, oh, fuck.  Someone told us that.  That would be a good thing to do.  Didn't that happen to Costner in The Big Chill? 
[02:48:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I think so, right?  Yeah, because he.  Because then he was just a corpse or something.  Yeah, he played the body.  He was just the body in The Big Chill.  Oh, man.  I wonder if he had to audition for that.  If they just were looking at head shots.  Yeah.  It's just like, he has a nice.  Right.  But I heard.  Dead guy look.  He filmed a bunch of.  I know, right?  He filmed a bunch of other scenes.  But in the end, that was his part in The Big Chill.  Right.  So, it comes out next year?  Yep.  That one comes out next year.  Damn.  You got any other ones coming up?  I got one with Elizabeth Banks called Walker. 
[02:49:00]  Holy fuck.  Bill's fucking getting some real roles, man.  Oh, fuck.  Is that done, too?  Keep fooling him.  I like how Bill reacts.  He grabs his hat.  He pulls it down.  He's like, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what this thing is.  That's filmed?  That's done, too?  Yeah.  I'm still a stand-up comic.  I know how this game works.  I've watched enough old Oscar footage to you literally see presenters and you don't  even know who they are.  Like, oh, shit.  Who the hell is that?  Like, they actually presented on the Oscars 10 years ago and then there's a couple like, 
[02:49:30]  ah, remember that guy?  So, I know how this works.  Do you want to at least be the remember that guy?  Presenter guy?  No, no.  I just want to do what I'm doing.  Be a comedian.  Sell tickets.  That's all I ever wanted to do.  And I act when they let me.  That's basically it.  And I go in.  I show up on time.  And I try to do a good job.  And that's it.  And now presenting for Best Animated Feature, Bill Burr and Jared Little.  A little fucking going back and forth, reading the fucking teleprompter. 
[02:50:00]  I wouldn't do that.  That would be great.  That seems like a hell good guy.  How you doing, man?  You were on the air.  We're on.  Take a seat right there.  We are on.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  Hang on.  You were here a while back.  Oh, yes, I was.  It was a while back.  Yes.  It was a while ago.  I forgot what it was even for.  We have to pronounce your name properly.  Uh-oh.  Adewale.  That's it.  Leave it there.  Yeah, Adewale.  That's it.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got that. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, last time you were here, we were talking about, of course, your role as Outer BC and  Oz and how you wore the little hat on your head and had to, like, glue it to the side  of your head or something.  No glue.  No, it actually stayed.  It was on a little bit of stubble, I think you said.  That's right, yeah.  So it stuck like Velcro.  It's all about the bristles, man.  The bristles.  Who do you play in Thor?  I play two characters.  Algrim, the strong, who transforms into Curse, this formidable beast who goes to... 
[02:51:00]  Curse man?  No.  He's cursed.  Curse man.  He's cursed to die.  But before he does, he takes on this formidable power, ten times that of Thor.  So it's kind of like Holyfield and Tyson, the big bout in the cosmos.  It's the big, big throwdown.  So you, you're the, I guess, the bad guy in the movie?  I guess you would be.  Yeah.  That's great.  They don't hire me for my good looks, man.  That's the bad guy. 
[02:51:30]  Nah, nah.  So how long did it take to, I'm going to ask the hacky question, how long did it take  to film, like, the fight scene where, do you get the hammer out of his hand?  Are you allowed to tell?  I got it in my hotel, actually.  So I think you won, right?  You got a hammer.  That's it.  I'm still standing.  No, the fight sequences were choreographed for over a number of weeks, three, four weeks.  And we did them in Iceland in minus 30 degrees.  So no matter how much you train inside the gym or a warehouse, you go out there. 
[02:52:00]  It's a very different ballgame.  Yeah.  But the prosthetic suit that I had on kept me warm.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It was lots of sweat and glue in there.  What a life you in Iceland wearing a prosthetic suit fighting Thor.  You got to be thinking, like, how the hell did I get here?  I was thinking, I'm getting paid for this.  This is great.  Actually, we did have a moment like that.  We were there like four in the morning.  He's in his red cape and his hammer.  And I'm standing there with horns on my head.  And we just had a giggle, man. 
[02:52:30]  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, you just look at each other like, what the fuck?  This is a job.  How is Iceland?  Cold.  It's cold?  Yeah, it's really cold.  But you know what?  It's one of the most spectacular places I've ever been to.  It was the first time I realized that we actually lived on a planet.  Right.  You know, because there's fissures coming out of the ground.  There's northern lights dancing in the sky, shooting stars falling all over the place.  It's just like, whoa.  Just so different from everything you've been used to in your whole life.  It was spectacular, though. 
[02:53:00]  Really, really big treat.  That does sound like a cold place to go.  I'm going there on December.  Are you up for what?  I've got a gig.  You've got gigs?  Is that English?  You've got one out there?  I have a stand-up.  I've got a stand-up gig over there.  I have no idea how it's going to go over.  It's going to be hilarious if I fly all the way over there to bomb.  Well, you know what?  Nobody's going to know.  So that's one thing.  That is true.  But the thing is, they've got this town called Reykjavik.  Yep.  And it's hot.  They drink a lot.  And when I say a lot, they drink a lot. 
[02:53:30]  I like this place.  Women are very forthcoming.  Oh, wow.  So even if you bomb, you're going to be okay.  Do they like the accent, the American accent?  Do you know what?  How does he know?  You might have an American friend.  I just think they know what they like.  And they come up to you and they'll tell you.  I want you.  You're coming with me.  Do they speak English over there?  Is that the...  Yeah.  They've got their own, you know, Icelandic language. 
[02:54:00]  Another wonderful country that actually, the majority of the people speak more than one language.  And they also stood up to the banks.  They were like, fuck you.  That's your debt.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you pay for it.  And the bank's kind of like, oh, all right.  Well, you know what you're going to do with that one.  You're going to balance it out?  We could have done that?  We should have done that.  Is that easy?  That's where Bobby Fischer beat Spassky for the chess championship in South Africa to Reykjavik, Iceland.  And when he was...  At the end of his life, they gave him a home when he couldn't come back to the U.S. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, right.  Just wanted to throw a sad fact into a fun interview.  So now you're the bad guy.  You're more powerful than Thor.  I am.  So he needs, like, Loki, I guess, to help him out.  And they're not on the best of terms from, like, the last movie.  You got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly.  And, you know, you see...  So it takes two of them.  Right, right.  That's what I'm assuming.  It takes two of them.  That's why he needs his little brother there or whatever.  Yeah.  This...  The Dark Elves is what we are known as. 
[02:55:00]  It's a race of aliens whose population has been wiped out by the Asgardians, by Thor and his people.  And so there's a point within the constellations when we can come back and reinstate ourselves and get some payback.  So that's really the...  How do people come up with the...  How are you that creative that you come up with this constellation and elves and stuff?  Like, did I try to write scripts?  And black elves, right?  Oh, it just comes out like a...  People opportunity elves. 
[02:55:30]  We're pointing...  They're all elves.  I got blue eyes in this one, boys.  You know, blonde hair.  You know, it's a real get-up.  You got blonde hair?  Yeah, blonde hair, blue eyes, pointed ears.  It's all there.  The only one that rocks, though.  You've got to be standing as you're putting that stuff on and thinking, like, this movie better work.  Yeah, because I'm going to...  This better work, man.  A little silly.  Well, you know what?  It's another one of those.  If it doesn't, nobody's going to recognize me anyway.  Oh, there you go.  No, but, you know, Marvel, they do those things the best, man. 
[02:56:00]  It really is.  They do these movies the best.  And the way they're doing special effects these days, it just...  It's so conducive to these action movies, the Marvel movies, and it looks great.  I mean, they...  Have you seen this one?  Not this one, no.  You saw the first one, right?  I saw the first one, yeah.  And, of course, the Avengers saw that.  It just...  They look amazing.  Wait until you see this one.  I mean, it's not because I'm in it.  It's like, even when I went to see it, I wasn't even concerned about my part. 
[02:56:30]  It's just a spectacle.  Yeah.  And I feel like they've really pushed the bar with the special effects here.  You're going to have a great time watching this.  You find when you watch these movies, you're looking all over the screen.  It's not just like...  You used to just kind of look somewhere on the screen and watch a movie.  Now you're, like, looking at different places on the screen because there's so much shit happening.  What you've got to do, though, you've got to see this on IMAX 3D.  IMAX 3D is the only one, though.  The real one.  The real one.  Yeah.  Not that Coors Light IMAX one that you get. 
[02:57:00]  No, no.  That screwed me over.  No, no phonies.  We went to go see Gravity.  Uh-huh.  And I kept saying to Nia, I kept going, well, it's IMAX, right?  It's IMAX.  And she, yeah, and I showed up.  It was bigger than the regular screen.  But IMAX is you can't see the dude's head in front of you.  No.  And you feel like you're going to fall off the earth.  That's it.  That's it.  Wraps right around your head.  Right, yes.  Beats you up with the sound.  I mean, it's like an orgy of experiences.  Yeah, I saw the last Star Trek in IMAX 3D.  It was amazing.  Like, you're in space.  You're fucking floating around in space. 
[02:57:30]  It's a great experience.  I just said, you know, I just saw, what did I just see?  Ender's Game in IMAX.  And I was just like, I got to get one of these in my house.  Oh, man.  This is the way to go, man.  I can't watch the TV now after seeing it.  We saw Gravity in IMAX.  And the most amazing part of it is when Sandra Bullock is fixing something outside the spaceship.  And she's just floating.  And it's this really weird sense of just kind of floating next to her.  It wasn't even a special effects action sequence.  It was just her floating right in front of your face was very surreal. 
[02:58:00]  Especially when she had Next to Nothing on.  I heard that was really spectacular.  I didn't care for that part at all.  I thought this was the wrong message.  The wrong message.  Yeah, I like a man with morals.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't go for that stuff.  A tawdry type of material.  Tawdry.  How many languages do you speak?  Just like two or three.  Two or three?  Yeah.  A little bit of English or what else?  A little bit of French, a little bit of Italian.  Okay.  It said our prep sheets are frequently very wrong. 
[02:58:30]  It says you are fluent in several languages.  It says Italian, Yoruba, and Swahili.  Yeah, Yoruba is my native tongue from Nigeria.  Okay.  So I can get along with that, too.  But often what they put down there is if you say a line or two in a movie, they say you're fluent.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was fluent for the movie.  I was fluent for the paycheck.  Yeah.  I got a little tie to Nigeria.  I just got an email from there.  There's like 20 million bucks waiting for me. 
[02:59:00]  I just got a...  Oh, you got that one, too?  Yeah, I just got to send them some fucking banking information and stuff, and it's all mine.  I'm really psyched.  Bill's just shaking his head.  No, I've got that one to say.  Let me know what you do.  I'm more shaking my head that people fall for that.  Still fall for it, right?  Well, that's their own fault, though, right?  Exactly.  I mean, like, how do you be so stupid and greedy?  At this point, it really is.  Yeah, and at this point, it's like everybody knows, don't they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At this point, it's like opening your front door and seeing a paper bag on fire. 
[02:59:30]  You don't step on it, because you know there's dog shit in there.  Especially with your email.  You've got to get the broom.  Yeah, get the broom.  If you're going to get...  It's like, dear sir, I need your help, and your email address is fartshitter at AOL.  So why are they contacting you with a financial...  This lawyer has a weird email.  No, it's like, somebody likes me.  Yeah.  I like the ones on the Facebook where there's just some unbelievably gorgeous woman will just  say, hey, I saw your picture, and like... 
[03:00:00]  Your male ego, you just want to believe it.  And you open it up, and it always says, this account has been deleted.  You're like, oh, I thought I was looking all right.  You know?  Oh, but I finally...  Not again.  Yeah.  I want you to be my friend.  Dude, I'm like Charlie Brown with that shit.  I will forever try to kick the football.  I always...  I always just want to believe every single time.  It's a hard-knock life, huh?  You've got to be sitting in front of a computer on Facebook looking for chicks.  It's like the ones that pick what town you live in, and it's like, you know, oh, Becky... 
[03:00:30]  Becky is in Comac, New York, right now.  No, I always get the right words.  Clearly, there's second language.  And it's like, I think you great you.  Like, whatever it is, it's going to be like, she couldn't misspelt it.  It's not even a she, it's a guy.  He just took the photo with some giant, hairy Russian guy sending the stuff to you.  Nobody is that lucky, man. 
[03:01:00]  Nobody is that lucky.  You've got to know.  You're crushing my drink.  You always open it, though, and be like, what is...  Yeah, you've got to have some hope.  You've got to.  Even if it's coming from Bulgaria.  We were talking about, before you came in, like, you're one of the rare people that have been on two TV shows that made it to syndication.  Yeah.  Yeah, so if you get to the third one, then you get into, like, we're talking, like, Lee Majors has done three.  Three.  Shatner. 
[03:01:30]  Shatner's done three.  And I think Heather Locklear's the king with, I think she's done four.  Man, that's a lot.  Four made it to syndication, so you're right there.  Yeah, you got one.  You're like the New York football giants with, like, four Super Bowls.  You get that fifth one, you're...  Dynasty.  Yeah.  You're getting some checks.  But this is good to know.  He's getting checks.  Uh-huh.  Damn.  Did you practice law at all or just graduate?  No.  I graduated and then I ran as fast as I could from it, you know.  But, yeah, seven years was enough. 
[03:02:00]  Did you ever take the bar or no?  No.  No.  Just did a bachelor's and a master's degree in law.  And that's in London.  That's it.  And then just dominated.  All casual about that.  That was in London, yeah.  All I needed.  And just became a movie star.  Yeah, and I...  What do you have your sights fixed on next?  Flying the next space shuttle?  Let's do that movie.  Yeah, a bit of directing, a bit of this, you know.  You can't go to Mars.  They're doing a Thor movie again, so.  Shooting the next thing in the North Pole.  Figured we'd go up there and go do that.  No, no, it was, it's been a great foundation, though, because it's what's helped me stay 
[03:02:30]  focused and disciplined, because you come in this industry all hippified, you know, always  artsy, but, you know, the law, you know, you train your brain and you approach it the  same way as you would a case, you know.  You analyze, you focus, you know, stats, everything.  So, it really helped me.  Yeah, it must be convenient to not have people be able to, you know, mumbo-jumbo you with  a contract bullshit.  Oh, man, you have no idea.  You know, I have, I have a lot of active friends that are always asking, especially when I 
[03:03:00]  first got in, they were calling me up for a lot of advice, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  To, to, to, to go over the advice that their own attorney.  It would be embarrassing if I had to ask you for advice, because I'm like, I'm so not  well-read with that stuff that I can't even intelligently, like, convey what the problem is.  Convey what the problem is.  I mean, I'm getting here, like, two paragraphs in, what is this shit about, uh?  Yeah.  It's all mumbo-jumbo.  You can break through it.  But you know what's funny is, like, obviously, you studied lore and then you, you know, you 
[03:03:30]  blow up by playing the most, you know, notorious comic in a prison, you know, in New York.  But that's, those aren't the best roles.  It is.  You don't want to be the, the good guy.  Come on, knock it off.  You were so evil in Oz, man.  It was just, whenever you, whenever you were on screen.  Yeah, it was.  Because whenever you were on screen, you're just like, oh, shit.  It almost felt like you were in the joint.  Like, you wouldn't want to avoid Arabisi in, in prison.  Arabisi. 
[03:04:00]  Arabisi.  At any, at any cost.  And then, like, you'd be watching at home and he'd come on screen and you'd be like, oh, shit.  Don't look.  Don't look at him.  Don't make eye contact.  Yeah, I mean, they should have a poster of him in the schools.  Yeah.  It's like, you know.  You have to be a deterrent.  Yeah, you know.  Do your homework.  That show was done so well, I, forget about avoiding his character, I avoided the series.  I wanted to go to a screen.  I was just like, dude, this is just.  Yeah.  Too real?  It's too much.  I mean, I almost would rather watch the, the documentaries of prison weren't as bad because 
[03:04:30]  they alluded to what happened.  Yeah, they edited it.  They showed it.  It was just.  People shitting on each other, the branding that would go on.  Yeah.  Didn't get that far into it.  Oh, it was, it was a nightmare.  I saw one rape and I was like, all right, that's how I thought it would go down.  You know, it was funny just yesterday.  I'm all good.  Just yesterday, this guy, he works just outside the building where I live and every time I  go by, he's always trying to, you know, pull me in, but I'm always going to work. 
[03:05:00]  And Jesse got me, he said, I just want to tell you, I'm such a big fan.  And, you know, and, and my, my favorite scene, he started to go into what his favorite scene  was when, when I had Kenny Wanger on, on the bed and I'm just looking, it's like eight  o'clock in the morning.  This guy's like, that's too much information.  I'm like, I'm glad that you like, he's going into all the, that's when you got to do the  cell phone trick.  Hey, I got to, I got to, you just keep walking.  When you rape somebody in a scene, do you get to cut him at craft services that day? 
[03:05:30]  You know, it's, it's, those are, those are tough, man.  Oh man.  I mean, personally, I could never be on the other end.  Right, right, yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  I just couldn't.  And it was a very, very traumatic scene for the actor.  It was, right?  It really was.  Well, I, you know, I shook him up.  Damn.  You know, there were tears because, because it's a violation.  Whether you're doing it or simulating it, it's like, ain't nobody want to do that and 
[03:06:00]  then not be seen to be doing that for a million.  So, you know, I applaud him because he's a great actor, but it's, it's hard, man.  I heard, I heard there was, there was a rumor that said, if you pissed off the writers on  that show, that they wrote a rape scene for you.  No, no, that was Mary Callen Moore.  That's, that's what I heard.  I'm not, I'm not saying that, I'm just saying, like, I don't know how this stuff starts.  No, it's true.  It is true?  Yeah, like, you know, you, you get axed. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  You get axed, raped, killed.  Shanked, whatever.  Damn.  And that was good.  That was the good times because you show up for work and you do your job.  Otherwise you were dead or raped or whatever.  Fuck.  I didn't realize it affected the actors after it was all done, though.  Say again?  I didn't realize it affected the actors, though, after they moved on from that.  Yeah.  I mean, it does.  I mean, it depends what you're doing.  But, you know, I mean, look, there were guys who were not homosexual, but they would come 
[03:07:00]  in and, you know, they're putting tongues down each other's throat.  I mean, you know.  Jesus.  Then you're going to go home and kiss the wife and the kids.  I mean, of course, you know.  Right.  It's going to shake you up, man.  Especially when you realize you're still thinking about work.  Well, you've got to go back to work and do it the next day.  You know.  Why does it now have to be tongues down the throat?  Well, I mean, that was that particular scenario.  They used to just fake that a little bit.  They would turn their heads to us or whatever.  Love scenes, even love scenes.  Right.  The whole thing is completely unnecessary. 
[03:07:30]  If you watch, like, old school movies, if they were going to show two people they were  intimate, they would go in the bedroom and they'd close the door.  Yeah, yeah.  You knew what happened.  You know, watch them like that.  Right, right.  They're just banging each other.  For some reason, they...  It needs to be broken down.  Yeah, they need to show it now.  I don't...  Well, they have to show how passionate it is and, oh my God, it's...  Look how...  Look how good they...  They fuck.  Don't you hate them?  For one of the better words.  What a connection.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate those clothes tearing off scenes. 
[03:08:00]  I fucking hate sex scenes.  It's angry.  Nobody fucks like that.  Oh, really?  That's it.  Where's this guy from, man?  Oh, God, just tweak my nipples.  I'm losing my erection.  Don't do it.  Don't talk.  I'm losing it.  No, I would say that.  I'd say that.  And actors eating in movies drives me up the wall.  Because they overact eating.  They'll point with the bread and shit.  Like at lunch, you would just be like, do... 
[03:08:30]  Like messing with the food on the plate with the fork too much, too.  Because they know they can't have food in their mouths.  Scraping it up and, you know...  You have to understand, like, when you're doing those scenes, you do it like a dozen times.  So you gotta eat a dozen burgers.  Oh, man.  So that's probably why they're, you know...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just...  You know, mouthing it off.  Jimmy doesn't like the love scenes because he thinks they're phony.  They don't exchange money at the end of the scene.  Absolutely.  If it's not an apology or cash, it's a lie.  That's why I look at a good sex scene. 
[03:09:00]  But I don't relate to that.  Normal people don't have sex that way.  I mean, you get a passionate sex.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I mean, I have sex that way all the time.  The clothes getting ripped off and...  Come on.  How about just...  Hang that.  All right.  Come on.  Well, wait a minute.  Well, how do you have sex?  He said it.  He wasn't lying.  He likes his nipples tweets.  You'll have sex.  And there's some other things that he's into.  I'm not sure if you want to say it.  I'm interested because I love that kind of sex.  I just...  I want to know, like, what kind of sex you have. 
[03:09:30]  Passionate sex is when you watch the way a movie because they can't...  You can't feel when you're watching...  It's like porno sex.  When you watch it, they do what looks good, not necessarily what feels good.  Like, I dated a girl in porn, and she would blow me, and it wouldn't...  It would be like...  Oh, she's just going through the motions, man.  That's motion.  And you're like, there's no cameras in here right now.  And I'm like, you're getting my whole dick in your mouth, and it's humiliating.  No, that was your foot.  Same measurement.  Yeah, no, that's what bugs me about it. 
[03:10:00]  And there might be some...  There might be some tinkle play in Jimmy's world.  Maybe.  I don't mind...  There might be a little tinkle play.  Yeah, a little tinkle play, sure.  Yeah, you don't like them going for the motions.  I'm with you on that.  And I like passion, but to me, they show passion to visual...  It's not that close, sharing.  I'm just picturing Jimmy, like, alone with this girl, and she's making all that noise.  He's not making any noise.  Like, her...  I'm just echoing in his fucking...  That's just weird.  I can just picture her sitting there tweeting while she's tweeting. 
[03:10:30]  Okay, now, okay, on this take, we can just bring the energy down?  Right, right, right.  I understand.  We're going to pull you back a little bit.  It's sort of like a performance.  But I guess if you're a porn star, you're feeling the pressure.  Right, right.  Like, because you're thinking, oh, man, this is a porn star.  And she's thinking, oh, fuck, he thinks he knows I'm a porn star, so she's all in.  This is a girl I saw quite a few times.  So you knew she was just overworking it.  That's how she did it.  She was also, I think, she was escorting, too, so that was just how she did it.  But, you know, I like it kind of mellow. 
[03:11:00]  The thing is, though, now, movie, it'll be all over the top.  You don't go with a porn star if you like it kind of mellow.  No, that's true.  Because they bring the job home.  They can't help it.  You're saying that's his first mistake?  That's his first mistake?  Yeah, I think that would...  I just, uh...  You've never had, like, that kind of passionate-looking sex on the movie?  Sure, I've had it, but not like they do in the movies.  Like, whether you watch the clothes getting dropped on the way to the bed and the hunger in their eyes.  It's like, oh, gosh, there's not a director in there with you.  You're like, go zoom in on the clothes. 
[03:11:30]  No, I just don't like it.  But, yeah.  It doesn't happen that way.  No, it actually does.  There are...  There are times it happens that way.  I think there are more times that it happens, especially, like, a crazy one-night-stand thing, or a...  Jim, I know what you're saying.  Drunken sex.  In fact, drunken sex always happens like that.  Drunken sex is like that.  It's very...  It's not like that every...  Coming off, tripping over.  Sloppy, sloppy.  Yeah, you jab it into her thigh.  Well, that happens a lot.  It's like a fucking dog. 
[03:12:00]  No one loses a rod in rated-R movies.  No one ever goes like, come on, shh, shh, shh, let me focus, let me focus, I'm losing it.  Never.  But that's true.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, let me go sit in my pants.  Easy, easy.  Exactly.  Fucking, uh, that's what I like.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Man knows what he likes.  What kind of lawyer did you want?  I wanted to be a defense attorney when I saw Justice for All.  That made me want to be a lawyer.  Criminal lawyer.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  A prosecution or a defense?  Uh, defense.  Was it for the, because for me it was like Pacino's big scene. 
[03:12:30]  You're out of, like, I like the idea of performing in front of a jury, and I think that's what  drives a lot of people who become performers into law, is the idea that you're going to  have this jury captivated.  You're going to speak to them and change them.  I think so.  I mean, um, it's very much an acting theater in, in, in the court, you know, you got to  convince people, you, you got to perform, basically.  Did you want to wear that wig though?  Hell no.  That's some silly, that's some silly wigs over there that they wear.  My, my, my, my father had, had one and he had it for like 20 years and it looked like 
[03:13:00]  a little dead rat.  He would brush it.  Oh, God.  And, and, and, you know, spray it and it, cause you know, it ferments and everything and  then, you know, you, you, you put it on top of your head and he was like really dark like  me and you know, this little dead rat on his head and you got, you got, you got to take  that seriously when somebody's defending you.  What is going to be a store where you can get a new one?  I, you know, it's a tradition.  Oh yeah, very much.  I mean, it's very, it's a tradition, you know, it's, it's, it's the wig. 
[03:13:30]  Do you have to do it?  Well, you, you don't have to, but you will be frowned upon.  It would be like wearing a rock t-shirt.  It would be like going into court naked.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That's something.  It's just so, as a barrister, we call them barrister.  Barrister.  Barrister wears the wig, man.  And is the, are the witnesses the same?  Is there a difference between the witness stand there and the witness stand in our judicial  system?  I don't know why I thought it was a stand or something or maybe it's the exact same thing.  I'm thinking of the other country.  Okay.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Yeah, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't have wigs.  We kind of ripped them off a lot. 
[03:14:00]  No, not at all.  Sometimes the men wear wigs and we get fooled.  You have toupees.  I didn't mean those.  I meant, you know, long flowing wigs.  What a lovely girl, I imagine.  Adam's apple.  Yeah.  Hey, what made you not do it?  What made you go forget it?  You know what?  It was more of a family tradition as opposed to a personal ambition.  You know, I'm the only boy of four girls, so I was expected to take over my father's  profession, but, you know, I did as far as I could go, keep them happy. 
[03:14:30]  Did he want you to do it and say, I want you to follow my footsteps?  Very much so.  How long before he accepted the acting thing, or has he had this point?  Well, once I became famous.  He actually got more business because, you know, like, people would, like, I would go  to his office.  He'd, like, call me up, come visit me.  And I'd show up at the office and, like, 30 people there waiting for all of his clients.  Hey, come see.  Yeah, come see your dad.  Because of, you know, you know, parents is on the TV. 
[03:15:00]  But it took a while because initially he had thought, you know, I'd betray, I was the  white sheep of the family.  You know, you know, you know, you see what I'm saying, you know, so, but, but they're  all good now.  I think what it was, my parents' generation, they were immigrants from Nigeria who came  to England, so their impression of entertainment was debauchery, drugs, prostitution, that's 
[03:15:30]  what they thought I was going to be.  They were right, but, no, no, but, but, you know, and I think when they saw it, you know,  that I was still the same guy.  Did they enjoy your, the shows you were on or, or just kind of be like, well, it's,  it's successful, but we don't necessarily like it.  Um, they, they do.  My, my mom doesn't like me dying.  She can't tell me.  Oh, yeah, well, that would be like any.  Once she dies, she gets up and leaves the movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She won't, she won't watch it anymore. 
[03:16:00]  She says, he's dead.  Why am I watching it?  Yeah, I've heard from other actors that their moms really get upset about that whole thing.  She gets really, she takes it personally.  That figures.  But, uh, I never thought of that before.  You gotta watch it.  Yeah, that your mom would be real bummed out about that.  Yeah.  My mother actually wrote it for it to happen to me.  It's all movies.  They'd be killing you.  They'd be killing it already.  Fucking Jimmy.  Hey, you're in, uh, you're in Annie. 
[03:16:30]  Are you, are you playing Daddy Warbucks?  No, um, Jamie Foxx is playing Daddy Warbucks.  Oh, okay.  I'm playing Jamie's right-hand man and confident.  And, um, you know, I'm his driver, bodyguard.  I'm his homie.  And, uh, I'm a friend to Annie.  I help her try to find her parents.  Yeah.  Good movie, man.  Really, really good, good movie.  Lots of loves on it.  Jamie's hilarious.  And we're shooting all over New York.  We got Cameron Diaz in it.  Will Smith is producing it.  Oh, wow.  Jay-Z's doing the music. 
[03:17:00]  So, it's going to be a nice one, man.  It's going to be a real nice Christmas.  And we got this lovely, lovely, talented little girl,  Quivange and A. Wallace.  She was Oscar-nominated for Beasts of the Southern Wild.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ten years old.  Oh, sure, right.  Blows you away, man.  Little Black Shirley Temple.  Incredible.  And you do stuff in, uh, your father and your mother would see you and stuff.  Did you do stuff in, uh, in England first, before here on TV, before Oz?  Was that your first vision?  No.  I mean, my career started in the States. 
[03:17:30]  I left, um, law in England and I came to America.  And that's where my career as an actor started.  So, um, and, you know, I actually did movies before even Oz.  I did, um, Congo, you know, the Legionnaire.  And, and, but Oz was the thing that really blew me up here.  Oh, you're great, man.  You're a great, great actor.  And, uh, you're in, uh, Thor, which comes out, uh, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Obviously.  And it's, uh, AdewaleTheArtist.com and, uh, Adewale, A-D-E. 
[03:18:00]  Am I saying that properly?  Yeah, that's beautiful, man.  A-D-E-W-A-L-E.  And, um, we got another nice one for you, um, um, Pompeii,  which is a Gladiator movie in February, too.  Oh, man.  You know, you're going to see AdewaleTheArtist.com and the Axe doing him up.  So, so, what's, what's out for that one?  Nice.  You don't have to rape anyone, right?  Always nice to come and see you guys, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, a lot of fun, man.  Thanks for coming.  Definitely. 
[03:18:30]  And Bill, um.  Yeah, yeah, I got a meeting.  The great Bill Burr.  I got a meeting to go to.  I'm psyched.  Can I plug Bill?  Oh, of course.  I don't know if there's tickets available, but try for the Beacon.  Friday night, Bill's got two shows.  Uh, give it a shot.  Sometimes they release tickets late.  You might get something, uh, and, of course, uh, Monday Morning Podcast and BillBurr.com.  Various movies.  He's a million gigs to go to his website.  Have they contacted you about the, uh, Breaking Bad sequel?  Oh, the, uh.  The Lawyer?  No.  No?  They haven't.  So, uh.  Come on.  I was never able to guess which way that show was going. 
[03:19:00]  Every time I thought it was going left, it was going right.  So, what I, if I had to guess what they're going to do, I think they're going to go back  to what got Saul to Albuquerque.  Right.  Okay.  So, I would guess if I was ever going to do it, it would be maybe towards the end.  You could pop in somewhere.  Which would be interesting, you know, with my hair fitting out, how they're going to do  that.  How they're going to, yeah.  It is a prequel.  I don't know, but all I know is I'm going to watch every episode, and all the work that 
[03:19:30]  I've been getting is because of Breaking Bad.  Vince Gilligan, I owe, the little acting career I have, I owe to him.  You, uh, yeah, like, just, you're one of the few that kind of make it through Breaking  Bad.  I kind of.  You're somewhere, but you.  I'm like Mr. Pink.  You survived.  I think Mr. Pink gets shot in the end if you listen.  I think he gets arrested.  He might get shot and arrested.  It doesn't seem fatal enough.  I'm just freeze, freeze.  Once you start shooting at cops, they're not going to, like, try to take you in at that 
[03:20:00]  point.  Well, that's true.  I finally get to do it.  I finally get to do it.  That was Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah, yeah.  But Bill kind of, you know, you know he's somewhere.  He's alive.  And then your buddy is left in that room where they told him, don't, don't leave.  They freak him out.  Which is hilarious.  They freak him out.  So he's just kind of sitting there.  He probably stays there for a couple of days.  You think he's there for a couple of days and peeked out.  Kind of tiptoed away.  Coast is clear.  He can fucking leave.  Who knows?  That was great.  Yeah, the final episode was fucking really cool. 
[03:20:30]  Why do I do it?  They did it.  It's bittersweet that it's over.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to buy the box set and I'm going to check out the Thor.  Yes, Thor.  What's the name of the movie?  Thor.  The Dark World.  The Dark World.  An IMAX.  The real one.  Yeah.  Go see it in the real IMAX.  You can see somebody's head in front of you.  You got ripped off.  And if you can't see it in IMAX, there's a special screening of it.  Where?  At the Comedy Works, November 15th and 16th, where I'll be doing my fucking shit act in  Albany, which I fucking never draw people. 
[03:21:00]  Never do I.  If I brought this entire room with me, that would be more people than I'm going to sell tickets  in Albany.  I'll come see you, man.  I'll come see you.  I'll bring some people.  Please, just fucking lay out in the first ten rows.  There's nothing happening in that club.  Stretch out.  How do I not sell tickets in Albany?  It's fucking awful.  Maybe this time you will.  A bag of anthrax would have more people show up to fucking see it and handle it.  All right.  Yeah, man.  We're out.  Bill, for a pleasure seeing you, buddy.  Always.  Thank you.  All right, man.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks, guys. 
[03:21:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  The day that Bill Burr comes in here and doesn't have a ton of fun shit to talk about,  that's the day the industry has changed him. 
[03:22:00]  That day was not today.  He may be, in terms of guests who just come in here with fun shit, he's got to be number one.  I mean, you just don't have to plan anything when you see Bill Burr on the prep sheet.  He's always got something to talk about.  I would love to see.  I don't know how deep he gets into these YouTube loops he goes on.  I don't know where he comes up with these articles, but it seems like all the time he's prepping for this show.  I've got to say thank you to him for providing us with such a great experience. 
[03:22:30]  Yes, it's after O.P. and Anthony Live.  Bill Burr was back on the ONA show today.  We haven't seen him in a while.  I was glad that everybody saw The Heat.  It was like everybody did prep for Bill Burr coming in, which never happens.  I told O.P. and Anthony about The Heat, which is a movie that Bill Burr was in.  And everybody unanimously decided that Bill Burr was great in the movie.  It's a little tougher selling O.P. and Anthony on the movie than I thought it should have been. 
[03:23:00]  To me, The Heat, I don't know how any of you guys saw that.  I thought The Heat was hilarious.  E-Rock, did you see The Heat?  No, I haven't.  I haven't watched it yet.  Okay.  Well, it's got my recommendation still on it.  And I don't care what O.P. and Anthony say about it.  They're usually very good about these things.  But in this case, I have to disagree.  And they're so influential, these O.P. and Anthony guys.  Because I'm getting tweets from people that are mad at me because I recommended The Heat. 
[03:23:30]  And they're mad at me before they watch the movie.  So they go in mad at me, and then they watch the movie, and then they're not mad at me anymore.  Because it's a funny movie.  It's fucking hilarious.  But Bill Burr was great in that.  He was great in Breaking Bad, you know.  I mean, he's just on such a roll.  I think Bill Burr also turned the room around as far as Melissa McCarthy.  No, it's not a...  You know what Bill Burr did today?  He did not turn the room around as far as Melissa McCarthy. 
[03:24:00]  He did what would have happened if Melissa McCarthy was in this room.  You know what he did?  What Bill Burr's best contribution was today?  What?  The reason everybody was against Melissa McCarthy was because nobody knew her in the room.  There wasn't anybody in the room who either was Melissa McCarthy or was friends with Melissa McCarthy.  So, of course, everybody's against her.  Bill Burr's best contribution today was after everybody went out to meet Bill Cosby.  And they came back still somehow finding the negative in it. 
[03:24:30]  That was his greatest contribution.  That was...  Pointing out that on this show, we cannot experience one moment of joy.  Never happy.  No.  Even when a good thing happens, we can't just say, look at this.  Look at how blessed we are today.  Look how lucky we are today.  There's got to be, yeah, but that other shoe's going to drop.  What was wrong?  You know what I mean?  Like, they went out and took photos with Bill Cosby today. 
[03:25:00]  Opie, Jim, and Bill Burr did.  And, of course, by within ten minutes of getting back, they're talking about his glaucoma.  You can't just say...  Remember picture pages?  That show was the shit?  It was.  He had that talking pen and everything?  Ripped me off, but it was great.  What do you mean it ripped you off?  Because I sent away for the picture pages with the Mortimer Ichabod marker, and I never got it.  The picture pages was the Bill Cosby kid show that he did in, like, the early and mid-80s.  So he had this talking pen on it, and it was shaped like a little dude. 
[03:25:30]  What was his name?  Mortimer Ichabod marker.  How do you know that?  Because I'm still bitter that I never got it.  Do you watch old episodes of picture pages?  I haven't in a long time, but they're all on YouTube.  What's a long time?  Like, years.  How many years, though?  Because if you say ten years, that's still...  Like, I haven't watched...  No, it's probably like four or five.  What?  I haven't watched an episode of picture pages in 25 years.  Well, that's your fault. 
[03:26:00]  So when you say I haven't watched an episode in years, you mean you were still in your late 20s, if not early 30s, when you watched an episode.  Because I was reminded of it again, and then I'm like, you know what, I'm going to look online and see if some of the stuff was up there.  Does it hold up?  Is there content in there that will entertain somebody who's an adult?  No.  It's not as good, is it?  No, and I like kid stuff, but it's perfect for a little kid.  It's just there's no value for it when you're older.  That's probably who it was intended for. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  For the little kids.  And stealing their money.  I always thought...  So they never sent you the pen at all?  No, because it was some address in Philadelphia.  Right.  And I remember bugging my mom, and she mailed it out.  Let me ask you, was it...  Were the 8th and Walnut, was it around there at some point in Philly?  The other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Okay, yeah, yeah, you could expect it.  They would not send you that pen.  And, yeah, it just never came.  That's terrible.  My sister got her dumb sweet pickles thing.  What's sweet pickles? 
[03:27:00]  It was some other thing that Nickelodeon had.  It was just...  Sweet pickles?  It was like a little green case that had, like, cards of animals and activities.  Was there a show called Sweet Pickles?  No, it was one of those advertisement things that would run in between the shows on Nickelodeon.  It was just an ad for Sweet Pickles?  Yeah.  And then...  I'll see if I can find the YouTube video.  But there's, like, a green van would show up at a kid's house, and all these people would  come out of the...  Okay, that doesn't seem like it's a good thing.  Yeah, it's weird.  But she wanted that, and she got that.  She wanted Sweet Pickles.  I never got my damn picture pages.  I always thought, like... 
[03:27:30]  I remember seeing one of the pens in person.  And that's when my whole world came down.  Because I guess I was a little idiot.  I didn't really put two and two together that the pen wasn't going to talk to you when  you got it in the mail.  I figured that you'd have a little animated, like, dude with a giant red head on the top  of your marker.  I didn't realize that it was just going to be a pen with a cardboard cutout on the end  of it.  I just wanted the marker.  You wanted the marker itself.  Because it made...  On TV, it made noise.  Well, yeah.  I figured that it would make me a better drawer, because that was never something I did well. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  But, I mean, it wouldn't have done that.  It was a cheap marker with a thing on it.  That monitor's not on on the other side.  Let me go to...  Oh, okay.  You go to 817.  In the meantime, have you found that thing?  I'm going to look for it right now.  You just really want to show me Sweet Pickles, huh?  It's so horrible.  But that's what Bill Burr's great contribution was today, that Opie and Anthony are just  negative about everything there is to be negative about.  Okay. 
[03:28:30]  E-Rock is now pulling up a...  Here comes the Sweet Pickles bus.  Smart moms know how kids' minds grow upon Sweet Pickles.  I had that shit.  I never knew it was called Sweet Pickles.  Starts with his free Sweet Pickles preschool bus.  I had that.  Stickers, games, and stickers.  Roland, I had that.  The Sweet Pickles.  Okay.  It's like a green lunchbox-looking thing.  And it's got flashcards in it.  And games and crayons and stickers.  But the lunchbox, the green plastic lunchbox, has stickers on the side of it, so it looks 
[03:29:00]  like a green van.  Yeah.  I had Sweet Pickles.  When I was a kid, I loved Sweet Pickles.  There was two commercials...  Holy shit!  ...in the early days of Nickelodeon, there was two commercials that ran all the time.  One was Sweet Pickles, and the other one was this kid in, like, an Explorer hat.  Yeah?  And he was, like, hiding behind a fake palm tree in his couch.  Are you talking about that little...  And he had those animal cards?  Are you talking about that little douchebag that was trying to get me to buy Encyclopedia 
[03:29:30]  Britannica's?  No, that's...  That was...  I think that was Opie at one point.  No.  But, uh...  No, there was a...  Let me see if I can find the other one.  I don't remember the animal cards.  How?  It...  You know what's crazy?  It always makes me think.  I was so into this Sweet Pickles thing when I was a kid, right?  And it was also a subscription thing, too.  Whatever it was.  Like, every month it would send you updated stuff.  Look, my mom took care of all that.  I don't know anything about subscription things.  I'm a little kid.  Yeah.  This is like 1987, probably.  I was three or four years old. 
[03:30:00]  But I love Sweet Pickles.  It's crazy to me that you can love something that much and then forget it ever existed.  Like, I totally forgot this Sweet Pickles thing was a thing.  Look it up.  Google image it.  And it kind of freaks you out, right?  Yeah.  It's a green snapping box with stickers on the side of it.  And I guess inside there's flashcards.  I don't even remember what was inside of it.  But I can't believe the amount of affection that I had for this thing. 
[03:30:30]  And now, I'm remembering that it even existed at all.  And the commercial, if I didn't know what it was, it looks like about a piece of shit.  It's what it looks like.  It's a big waste of money.  But I loved it.  Apparently, it's not a waste of money.  But at least you got your Sweet Pickles.  Oh, yeah.  I was all about the Sweet Pickles.  I did not get my picture pages.  You were sitting there looking at the mail slot, wondering when the mailman, who was also  a Filipino soccer player, because you had the same mailman as Pee Wee Herman, when he  was going to bring you your Mortimer picture pages pen. 
[03:31:00]  You know, Bill Cosby's still down the hall.  Maybe I should ask him where I want my Mortimer Ike Bob Marker.  Get that shit from him.  He's got to have him.  I said, you failed me as an educator.  And say, no, no money back.  Give me the pen.  Adam in Texas.  Yeah.  Did you ever think that your mom was trying to save you from not being like a total loser  for the rest of your life?  Not sending that off?  Maybe that's what your mom was doing. 
[03:31:30]  She was trying to save you because she knew that little baby E-Rock would have gone to school  with his picture pages pen.  And would have, I mean, you would have gotten the shit kicked out of you.  She was trying to prevent you from wasting your life and buying toys and shit as an adult.  I think that's what she was getting at.  How successful was she, Adam?  I would say not very well.  Not very successful.  Thank you.  Failure.  Maybe she already saw your life of consumerism starting to form before her eyes.  I had to have gotten it from somebody. 
[03:32:00]  And she wanted to put the kibosh on it?  No.  She was, I remember, because I was complaining.  How old were you?  Five, six.  When you were older than that?  No.  You were probably about 13.  When I wanted picture pages?  I think so.  I'm 35 and I want picture pages.  Okay, that's weird.  That's like, that's on, that's on some weird pedophilia stuff.  Drew in Louisiana.  Hey, Sam, you know, picture pages was for retards and dyslexics.  Picture pages was?  Yeah.  I don't think picture, I don't think. 
[03:32:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, oh, what's wrong?  Oh, you know what's for dyslexic and retards?  Messed up jokes.  Messed up jokes.  No, I'm all.  Drew, don't save yourself.  Don't save it.  You can't do it, buddy.  You fucked up, didn't you?  Did you fuck up?  Yeah, I did.  I fucked up.  All right.  Will you apologize to the listeners?  No, I will not.  Apologize, Drew.  Drew?  Apologize.  Okay, goodbye.  What's up, Jim?  Nothing.  I just wanted to, I have to go to the gym, so I just wanted to be here for a minute.  Okay, how are you?  I'm okay.  We were just talking about E-Rock. 
[03:33:00]  He was very pissed.  He was wondering if he could go to Bill Cosby.  You ever know the kid show that Bill Cosby did?  By the way, Jim Norton has stepped in the studio.  Do you ever know the kid show that Bill Cosby did, Picture Pages?  I never saw that one.  Jesus, I'm not going to talk to him.  I hate the breathing.  I'm not going to talk to him.  You know what?  I hate the saliva chomping that you can hear in his mouth.  That's what it is.  It's the...  And I find myself doing that throughout the day just because I have fucking Craig's voice 
[03:33:30]  in my head.  I never saw that Brett program.  I'm going to tell you that Craig doesn't enter my head at all.  Like, he's not a part of my life.  Derek in Philly.  Two things.  One, Craig's a cunt.  True.  Yeah, you keep saying that.  Let's just see what happens to you.  Nothing.  Go ahead, Derek.  Number two.  Do you guys remember those trolls with the crazy hair?  When we were younger, you could buy those trolls.  Of course.  Well, I remember there was a commercial where they put...  The new release had a gem in their belly button. 
[03:34:00]  Treasure trolls.  Yeah.  Yeah, treasure trolls.  And when you touched the...  You never had any treasure trolls?  I hate that you remember that immediately.  I did.  When you touched the belly button, though, they giggle on the commercial.  So all that I wanted was a troll that giggled.  It came in the mail.  I opened it up.  No noise.  I cried for two days.  Were you a homosexual as a child?  Yeah.  No.  My mom didn't baby me like you, but I mean...  Ooh.  I don't even know what that means.  Your mom got you a treasure troll and you thought it was going to giggle at you.  Those suck.  They're awful. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, they do suck.  Those are girls' toys.  They're terrible.  Those are for ladies.  Yeah.  Tom in Tennessee.  Hi, what's going on, fam?  Hey, as soon as you guys said sweet pickles, I got fucking goosebumps.  Life revolves around...  Were those goosebumps or douche chills?  Goose chills.  Douche chills.  Fucking the whole thing.  But there's one thing that stuck out.  Like, my mom was reading...  I was reading one of the book part, and in the book it said, I love you, and it had  a question mark and an exclamation point, and it fucked me up forever. 
[03:35:00]  Because it made you question.  Question mark and an exclamation point.  If she couldn't explain it to me, it fucked me up for years.  I get that, Tom.  And that's what it does.  I was just telling him, because E-Rog was bringing up toys again, of course, but he  played something for me called Sweet Pickles, which was this case of flashcards that I didn't  even know it was Sweet Pickles.  I was like, what the fuck are you talking about, Sweet Pickles?  And I saw this commercial, and it reminded me that I was all about Sweet Pickles when  I was a kid.  Like, I had the thing, and I loved the thing, and it blew my mind that I could spend, like, 
[03:35:30]  years of my childhood being obsessed with something, and then totally forget it ever existed.  Do you still like Sweet Pickles, Eric?  No, I never liked the Sweet Pickles.  Well, you remember the Picture Pages thing I was telling you about?  The Bill Cosby Kids show?  Yeah.  I go, Eric said that he watched it when he was a kid.  And I was like, when was the last time you watched an episode?  He said, years ago.  I said, yeah, but, like, Eric, the last time I watched an episode of Picture Pages was  25 years ago, when it was on television and I was a child. 
[03:36:00]  And he goes, no, no, no, like four or five years ago.  Why would you watch that?  I was looking at Bill Cosby stuff, and then I thought of Picture Pages, and then I was  like, oh, but when you're an adult, and you look at Bill Cosby stuff, you look at his  comedy, you can even watch, even if you're watching episodes of the sitcom, that's fine.  The Cosby show.  Yeah, or the Fat Albert, even.  Fat Albert.  Fat Albert would be okay.  But not Picture Pages.  Picture Pages.  Remember this?  Never saw this punk as shit.  That's the wrong theme, though. 
[03:36:30]  Colors are really nice, though.  Even you're a Bill Cosby fanatic.  Like, I mean, and you're not a Picture Pages fan.  Yeah.  Craig, Craig, I was trying to talk to Jim.  Did you consider that voice?  It's always tough.  That's your...  Oh, I think it would be a Ruka Hort sound.  What a horrible ringtone.  So annoying.  The whole thing is just annoying.  Pick up the phone.  Hey, what's up, Roll?  Nobody calls him Roll. 
[03:37:00]  Alex in New Jersey.  Hey, so the...  That was called Zoo Books.  The animal pages.  And, like, yeah, you...  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You got, like, packs to them.  I'm hearing a whole bunch of different things now.  Animal pages and Zoo Books?  Yeah, yeah, that was called Zoo Books.  Remember it was a subscription?  That's one of those commercials with the Explore hat that Slavo was talking about over there?  Slavo.  You didn't even know anything about Zoo Books?  Yes, asshole.  Zoo Books.  I love you, Yara.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later.  Let me see.  What's a zoo book?  I thought they were cards, but maybe it was a book. 
[03:37:30]  No, this is different.  Oh, that's when they tried to get little kids to subscribe to magazines about lions and zebras  and stuff.  There was a lot of bullshit subscription stuff going on for your parents to pay for.  Does that still exist, like, online?  You can't cheat Columbia House anymore.  Right, because you used to cheat...  Well, that was when you got older.  You could cheat Columbia House.  I had 50 different names.  You did?  Yeah.  But is there, like, the way before, when we were growing up, there were all these, you  know, stupid flashcard services and Zoo Book magazines and stuff like that, subscription 
[03:38:00]  services to try to get the parents...  Even Encyclopedia Britannica was a subscription service.  Is there anything like that for kids now?  Is it in-app purchases and all that?  I'm sure there are on the kids' channels.  What did you say, Craig?  He panicked when I went to him.  He goes, sure.  Or, I go, what did you say, Craig?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's shaking his head.  Tyler in Sacramento.  What's up, Tyler?  How you doing, Sam?  That last guy to call was an asshole. 
[03:38:30]  What Slavo was thinking of was the Illustrated Wildlife Treasury.  Was that it, Slavo?  I don't know, asshole.  What's the name?  Illustrated.  He's still looking it up.  Wild.  Chad in Wisconsin.  Chad!  Oh, Chad!  Come on!  Yes, this is it.  Jay, I used to work for an airport here in western Wisconsin.  And Bill Cosby flew in a few times.  My job was to park jets, private jets, and fuel them when they came in.  Yeah, I fucking flew a few jets at one point in my life, too. 
[03:39:00]  It's crazy, right?  I'm sure you did, Chippa.  But anyways, he's got a $2 million special carpet that he ordered for his side of the airplane.  Bill Cosby.  And the guy I was working with just gently brushed his shoe next to Bill Cosby's carpet,  and he lost his fucking shit, man.  He's got a $2 million carpet that he puts down in airplanes?  He's got two sets of it.  He's got one set to keep in his airplane while he's flying it,  and the other set is clean and ready to go. 
[03:39:30]  So when he gets his other set clean, he's constantly got $4 million worth of fucking carpet in his guy.  That's crazy.  I've got to get some Cosby money.  I paid for that.  So if I can say from Eau Claire, Wisconsin to Bill Cosby, a big fuck you, sir.  I mean, look.  How would you feel if you had a $2 million rug and some yutz was putting his oily fucking boots on his feet?  Yeah, like some idiot who walks around an airport all day with sticky shit?  Yes.  He's going to walk on your $2 million carpet?  Yeah, the guy who does the fucking orange things that waves a plane into the hangers. 
[03:40:00]  Right, yeah.  Yeah, put his dumb oily boots.  He's got tarmac juice on his heel, and he's stepping on a $2 million rug.  Exactly.  I'm totally Team Cosby in this one.  There's somebody that wants to talk to you, Jim.  Okay.  Lady Di.  Hi, how's everything?  Oh, it's great.  I'm on the air.  Yeah, you're on the air, buddy.  I already know that.  I already know that.  Oh, good.  Lady Di, a lot of people don't know this.  You want to bring everybody inside.  Lady Di was on hold today for two and a half hours. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, two and a half hours?  Two and a half hours.  Oh, okay.  What's up, Lady Di?  What's going on?  One and a half hours, but that's okay.  No, it was two and a half, but go on.  All right, yeah.  Is Jim Norton still there?  Yeah, I'm right here.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  I loved your show.  Thank you.  Jim, I don't know if you know this or not, but yesterday, I started following. 
[03:41:00]  Do you follow Lady Di on Twitter?  Of course I do.  Okay, well, I don't know why she direct messaged me then.  She direct messaged me a lot.  She does?  I love it.  Anthony wants you to direct message him.  Yeah, have you not direct messaged Anthony?  No, no, no.  No, no, he does not want me to do that anymore.  I directed him one message.  Di, he's joking.  He's joking.  He's kidding.  Opie was actually bothered that you don't PM him because he's like, why is she talking  to Anthony and not me?  Like, I've been friends with her for just as long.  It gets really jealous and weird.  Wait a minute.  Hold on. 
[03:41:30]  Hold on.  Anthony told me not to do it with him.  Yeah, that was a joke.  No, the reason he said that is because you're not doing it to Opie and Opie's giving him  shit like, how come Diane is talking to you and not me?  Oh, okay.  Do you want me to DM him too?  Yeah, because what happens is when you start sending messages to Anthony and then Opie finds  out he's not getting direct messages from you, it makes him feel like you don't like  him as much and he's sensitive to that shit.  Oh.  You know how Opie is.  He's just weird about this stuff.  I am so sorry about that.  Okay, I'll DM him too. 
[03:42:00]  DM him.  And then I'll be fine with it, but it's just, you know, you can't do one and not the other.  They start to, one of the start, you know, it's like they want to both know that they're  respected and liked and, you know, equally.  I got an interesting DM from Lady Di yesterday.  She was asking for your phone number, Jim.  She asked me if I could send her your phone number.  Yeah, I had some.  No, no, no, no, not Jim Norton's phone number.  No, no, no, not his phone number.  You said Jim from the show.  I'm going to send him to the show for your show because I was on hold yesterday too. 
[03:42:30]  Right.  Well, you have the phone number.  She sent me 10 DMs already since October 31st.  Oh.  You know what?  I'm still new to the Twitter thing.  Oh, no, it's fine.  They're all delightful.  Keep them coming.  I apologize about all the Twitter stuff.  Lady Di, you were at Jim's comedy show over the weekend, correct?  Andrew Dice Clay, yeah, last weekend.  I thought it was funny because Jim had a story.  He spotted you in the audience.  You and Marion. 
[03:43:00]  Excuse me?  You and Marion were in the audience, and I went out to watch Dice, and you both started  going, hi, how are you?  And I had to go back into the dressing room.  Was that in the middle of Dice's set?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We did do that.  We did do that.  Yes, you did.  No.  Was there any thought, Lady Di, about how Dice, performing on stage, would react to two  mongoloids in the crowd saying, how are you?  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Sure.  Is this Anthony?  Yes, this is Anthony.  You know, Di...  No, no, no. 
[03:43:30]  You sound like Anthony.  I don't know.  Here's what you've got to do.  He's going to be very insulted by that.  If you want to give Ant your number, the way to do it is...  But you have to be careful.  You've got to do it right.  You don't want to Twitter it, because then everybody will see it.  But you want to send it out to Anthony on Twitter, but put two periods after it.  Because if you put two periods after it, only he'll get it.  Two periods after it.  Okay.  I don't know.  How about this?  I don't know about these things.  Send out... 
[03:44:00]  Tweet your number, but put two periods after it.  Two periods after.  Okay.  Yeah, but you have to put the two periods.  Right.  Okay.  Why would you do that?  Because you have to.  Because what happens is if you put two periods after it, it will just go out, I think,  as a private message, it won't be...  But, you know...  I thought direct message was a private message.  Yeah, but direct message, a lot of times, people can get into.  I don't trust direct message.  So what method do you trust?  If I have something private to say to somebody, I tweet it with two periods after. 
[03:44:30]  But there has to be...  After the message.  Two periods after kind of, like, makes it a private thing.  It doesn't go all the way out.  Okay.  See, you know, I...  And you're saying Anthony needs her phone number.  Yeah, Ant will call you, but he's not going to yell at you, but he would just straighten  it out.  I mean, but just send him the tweet and see what he says.  You want me to send him my phone number and send him the tweet?  Yeah.  So you're saying direct message is not the way to go? 
[03:45:00]  Nah, I don't like direct message.  Oh.  You've got to be kidding, right?  No.  Now, Lady Di, did you take any consideration to the fact that Andrew Dice Clay was on stage  performing while you and Marion were a couple of overweight hyenas in the crowd going,  How are you, Jim?  Jim, over here!  Hold on, hold on.  We didn't do that through the whole entire show.  Oh, just for part of it?  For one.  Yeah, just for the part... 
[03:45:30]  No, we did not do that through the whole entire show.  But just for some of it.  In the beginning, when Jim Norton went up there...  Oh, oh, okay.  So it wasn't like a...  It was like a minor interruption.  One more thing.  Also, we tried to film the show.  I tried to film the show.  Oh, from the audience?  Yeah, from the audience.  Oh, great.  You were allowed to do that because you were with us.  So you should have done that.  Kenny asked me if I'm filming the show. 
[03:46:00]  I said, nope, and I shut it off.  No, that's wrong.  Kenny should shut up.  Here's what you've got to do.  Send at your information now.  Send at my information now?  Yeah, send your information now because he's in a meeting.  He'll be out in a couple of minutes.  What do you mean?  Send him your number so he can call you and straighten it out while he's in the truck.  He's not going to call me.  Yeah, he will, actually.  No, he won't.  All right, you would know.  I'm telling you what he said.  I'm telling you what he said.  You have a real defeatist attitude going into this thing. 
[03:46:30]  And it's the same reason why you're having trouble getting work.  It's the same reason why things...  When you have a defeatist attitude...  Yeah, what did Handist?  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  What I'm going to do is...  I already applied at a place two days ago.  You have a job?  No, I don't have a job yet.  Oh.  You've got to interview me.  Where'd you apply to?  The Burger King down the street.  Okay.  I mean...  I'm serious. 
[03:47:00]  No, I thought it was just a joke.  You're kidding?  Are you kidding, or...?  No, no, I'm serious.  I really applied over there.  Oh.  Now, why did it take you six months to apply to a job at Burger King?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Okay.  Why did it take me six months to apply at a job at Burger King?  I don't know.  I just asked you.  Yeah.  What are you, the Burger Queen or something?  Go ahead, Di.  Is this Sam?  Who am I talking to?  You're talking to Sam, Jim, and Chip Chipperson.  Oh, okay. 
[03:47:30]  Okay.  What's up, Di?  Di, it's Chippa.  Wait, wait.  Just listen to me.  Hey, Di, it's Chippa.  I love your stuff.  Hey, Di, Rick in Connecticut has something to add.  He was sitting behind you at the Jim and Dice show that you were at over the weekend.  What?  That was him, okay.  I am a professional broadcaster and Chippa.  Hello, Chippa.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  I'm doing all right.  How you doing?  Keep rocking until your cock starts knocking.  What are you talking about?  Rick, I need you to ignore Chip.  He's a hindrance here and is only looking to muck up the works, so to speak. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, a fucking mongoose.  I don't know.  Keep quiet for a second.  Whatever.  Rick, talk to me about going to the Jim and Dice show.  You were sitting behind Lady Di.  What happened?  First of all, the Jim and Dice show was awesome, legendary.  Chippa, you did a great job.  Fuck yeah.  Go ahead, Di.  You tell him.  Oh, Christ.  Lady Di.  Di?  Yes?  Every time Jimmy looked towards our way out of the weekend. 
[03:48:30]  One at a time, Diane.  Diane, tell him.  And we wait.  Diane, one at a time.  Rick.  No, Diane.  One at a time.  I'm going to go to Rick right now.  What'd you say, Di?  Hey, Lady Di, shut up.  I wait.  You talk the whole time.  Yeah, be quiet, Diane.  I can't hear you, Diane.  What'd you say?  Go ahead, Rick.  Hey, now.  You got to send your number to Anthony.  Lady Di talked the whole entire time.  Bobo was sitting in front of her. 
[03:49:00]  She was waving like a frigging retard to Jimmy every time he looked over to us.  She was trying to...  What was she talking about the entire show?  She was talking about...  I was with my cousin, Phil.  She was like, oh, he's too young for me.  I can't take him home.  Oh, I remember now.  Diane, I remember.  Were you talking for the entire comedy show?  No, I was just talking to the people behind me.  Why would you talk?  It's a comedy show.  And then every time we got up, we saw her large white underwear. 
[03:49:30]  And it was fucking terrible.  Go ahead, Di.  Di, you got to send Ant your information.  It's Jim again.  Di, answer me this.  Were you wearing large white underwear?  Well, I'm a large person, yeah.  And it was white.  So he did, in fact, see your underwear throughout the evening.  Oh, my God.  And then...  She drank probably a six-pack.  And the people standing up in the aisle next to us... 
[03:50:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where did she drink the six-pack?  She drank the six-pack in the theater.  No, wait a minute.  How about it?  Yeah, yeah, you know.  I got the beer from the...  Oh, fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah, Chippa.  She drank a six-pack, and she was handing the garbage to the people in the aisle to throw away from her.  Oh, yeah, that I did.  That I did.  She was fucking a first-class student.  All right, thanks, Rick.  It's a crazy day.  I did that.  I did that.  Diane, why didn't you throw out your own trash? 
[03:50:30]  I don't know.  I didn't feel like getting up and...  Oh, you're such a...  Just a...  Lumpy.  You're a nudge.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I tried to film the show.  But Kenny kept on...  He was stopping me from filming the show.  Oh, yeah, no, you should be able to film the show.  It's your privilege.  But you were talking throughout the show.  You wanted to film it.  Do you understand that when you buy tickets to a comedy show...  Di, when you buy tickets to a comedy show, you don't now have rights over the entire auditorium. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, but you know me.  You're buying admission to experience a show with a community of people.  You have to take note of them.  Yeah.  So when you're yapping the whole time, when you're drinking a six-pack, when you're giving  your garbage to the ushers, when you're trying to film the show and Kenny has to come over  to you, don't you realize that you're being a disruptant? 
[03:51:30]  I guess I was.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I mean, I tried.  I tried to...  I just...  Hold on.  I just got a text from Anthony, who's in the back of the meeting listening, saying,  why won't she send it?  What is Ant looking for her to send?  Why won't she send what?  I told you to send your...  I told her about that?  ...number it to him.  There's no...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  There's this whole thing, because you DM'd Anthony and you didn't DM Opie, so Opie's giving 
[03:52:00]  Anthony shit about it, so then Ant's telling you don't DM him.  So I'm telling you, he's like, well, have her...  Because he's not going to give you his number until you send yours.  So you send...  You don't even DM Opie?  Yes, but you got to send Ant your number first.  Just what you do is you put it out like it's a message to Anthony on Twitter, but make  sure you put two periods after it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Say that one more time.  Are you on...  Are you on...  Are you on Twitter right now?  Are you on your Twitter right now?  No, I'm not on Twitter right now.  I'm on the phone.  Well, go on Twitter right now while we're talking to you.  I can't. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  I'm on the phone.  Go to...  Here's what you do.  Go to Twitter.  And you know how you send Anthony a message publicly?  Right.  Right.  Put your number there, but put two periods after.  You have to put two...  Period, period.  By my home phone number.  Right.  Right?  And put two periods after that?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You know what?  If I do this, it's going to be a private message.  It's going to be a direct message. 
[03:53:00]  To Anthony.  It's going to be direct.  Yeah.  It's going to be direct.  Yeah.  Do your cell phone.  Not your home phone.  Your cell phone.  How long ago did you apply to the job at Burger King, Diane?  About maybe three or four days ago right now.  Okay.  And are you looking for a full-time position or a part-time?  Or what exactly are you looking for over there?  They're not going to give me a full-time position.  I already know that.  All right.  I got to go to the gym.  Goodbye, Lady Di.  I have to go.  All right.  Jim is leaving.  Say goodbye to him, Di.  Bye, Jimmy.  Since you're going to insult Anthony... 
[03:53:30]  No, no, no.  I'm not going to insult Anthony.  No, I'm just giving you a little bit of a hard time.  I don't have any answers.  Oh, Craig.  You want to do a Craig's Conundrum before you go?  No.  Hey, wait a second.  Oh, I wish I had a commercial break to throw to, but I don't.  Who's buried at Grant's tomb?  Shit, go about it.  Grant is.  That's why it's Grant's tomb.  And then after...  Hold on a second.  I was doing a Craig's Conundrum.  Diane, would you like to participate?  Craig Schenkel has just entered the studio.  Craig Schenkel.  Hello, Craig Schenkel? 
[03:54:00]  I'm Craig Schenkel.  But Craig is a TV personality.  I do conundrums.  And he's got a game that he wants to play.  Diane, would you like to play?  What game?  It's called Craig's Conundrums, right?  Give out brain teasers and such, and you have to kind of come up with...  What?  It's a brain teaser game.  So we're going to go ahead and play Craig's Conundrums here on the after show.  Here comes Craig Schenkel and our contestant, Lady Di.  Go ahead, Craig.  Who's buried at Grant's tomb? 
[03:54:30]  Shit, go about it.  You're listening to that squad.  Did she get it right, Craig?  She must have heard that already.  All right, we'll do another one.  Diane, that was a practice round.  We're going to do one more.  Here we go.  Craig's Conundrums.  Okay.  Okay, go ahead.  If two people leave the Baltimore train station at the same time, but they go different routes,  which one gets to New York City first?  Excuse me, you're going to have to repeat that.  Okay.  Repeat the question. 
[03:55:00]  If two people leave Baltimore on the train at the same time, but they're going to New York,  which one will get there first if there's different routes taken?  Shit, go about it.  Which one, Diane, will get there first?  A shinkle about it.  Diane, we are going to need an answer.  Repeat that one more time, please.  Repeat that one more time.  Craig, last time.  Repeat the question, and then we're going to need an answer, Diane.  If two people leave a train station at the same time, but they're headed to New York City, 
[03:55:30]  which one of them will get to New York first?  Train A or Train B?  But they're going different routes.  Shit, go about it.  Which one is it, Diane?  Train A or Train B?  Train B.  She go about it.  Yeah, we asked you to do that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I still don't understand the question.  Well, go ahead.  Train A or Train B?  She go about it.  She go about it first.  Train A, train A, train A. 
[03:56:00]  That's absolutely correct.  You failed Craig's conundrums.  Oh, I'm sorry, Diane.  You failed Craig's conundrums.  Now, Diane, let me ask.  What's the name of the man you live with again?  His name is Bill.  You and Bill are sexual together, yes?  No.  Not now or not ever?  Not ever, really.  Well, what's really?  Not ever.  No, you said not ever really.  So, are we talking about, like, I'm talking, have you ever made out with Bill?  Have you ever kissed him on the mouth? 
[03:56:30]  Ah, yeah, in the beginning.  You have.  What about, have you ever had your mouth on or near his genitals?  No.  Diane.  What?  We know the truth.  You ever suck his big pecker?  Tell the truth.  No.  Yeah, you did.  You did, didn't you?  And it's fine if you did, by the way.  So, just vaginal intercourse, then?  No, nothing like that.  Nothing.  Really, I'm serious.  Just mouth kissing?  Yeah, that's it. 
[03:57:00]  You ever give him a handjob?  No.  How big is his penis?  I don't know.  Tell me the truth.  I don't know.  Do you want to apologize to the audience that you were, for what, for your behavior at  Jim's comedy show?  Ah, yeah, I apologize to everybody, but what am I apologizing about?  Your inappropriate behavior.  You're talking, you're drinking, you're...  I tried to film the show. 
[03:57:30]  You're filming?  And I tried, and Kenny stopped me.  Have you been drinking this morning a little bit?  Huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why?  A little bit.  What are we drinking?  Natty Ice?  I mean, what do you think?  Pop one open!  Ha ha, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.  Hold on, Bill, get me a Natty Ice.  Get a Natty Ice from Bill.  Let's pop one open for the after show.  Okay.  All right, let's pop one open.  There. 
[03:58:00]  Okay, hold on a second.  Okay, here it comes.  You guys aren't drinking, I know that already.  We're drinking.  Glug, glug, glug.  Oh, that's good stuff.  No, you're not.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Diane.  Pop it open.  Well, if Bill gets it for me, I'll pop it open.  Hurry up, Bill.  Get that cock over here with one of those Natty Ices.  Tell him.  Say, Bill, get that cock over here with one of those beers.  Yeah, then hurry up.  Tell him to get the cock over here.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm just kidding.  You guys are crazy. 
[03:58:30]  I know you're just kidding.  We're just, we're all just, it's all in good fun.  30 more to go.  30 more to go, yeah.  30 more to go.  We're going to finish him today.  Let's pop it open.  All right, yeah.  He said, let's pop it open.  We're going to finish him today.  That's right.  We're partying, baby.  Are we going to do it or what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, the thing about Twitter.  Yeah.  You pop it open?  I'm just getting sick when you think it's fucking funny.  All right, wait, wait, hold on. 
[03:59:00]  What's wrong with Bill?  No, no.  He's just being, uh...  Calm that big cock of his down.  What?  Tell him to calm that big cock of his down.  Yeah.  See, I said, calm down.  No, no, no.  That's not what I said.  Don't misquote me.  All right, go ahead.  Well, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be nasty about it.  Uh, Anthony on Twitter, 908, well, my phone number, you know.  Yeah, I was about to say, I don't want that on the air, Diane.  No, no, no.  That's all right.  That's all right.  I'm not going to say it.  Don't be a fucking idiot, after all. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, well.  You know.  And two periods at the end of the phone number, and then you'll get my phone number?  Look, I got to tell you something.  You listen to the show, right, Diane?  Yeah, I do.  You always hear me talking about, I hate Steven Singer?  What?  I hate Steven Singer, and people wonder, why do you hate him so much?  Is that right?  Who's Steven Singer?  The reason that you're going to hate Steven Singer, they come in many colors this holiday  season.  Have you heard about this, Diane? 
[04:00:00]  No.  Many colors of diamonds.  That's right.  Steven Singer has a brand new collection of colored diamonds, starting at just $249.  Lady Di, what do you think of that?  Oh, that's wonderful.  You can choose from sky blue diamonds, green diamonds, yellow diamonds, black diamonds,  and more.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  You have to understand something.  Right.  I don't have XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  Well.  I'm probably the only one out of all your fans that doesn't have the XM Satellite. 
[04:00:30]  Sure.  I mean, that makes it tough to be a fan.  No matter which color or size you pick, you're going to come out a hero.  Diane, you have to get the woman in your life a great gift, and you want it to be great.  I don't have no woman in my life.  Well, I mean, I don't know.  I guess I made a judgment call there.  The more you procrastinate in buying her a gift, Diane, the guiltier you're going to  feel.  The guiltier you feel, the bigger the present you're going to have to buy.  So take my advice.  Are you going to take my advice, Diane?  I'll take your advice. 
[04:01:00]  Check out Steven's new selection of colored diamonds.  What color are you thinking about, Diane?  Diamond.  Right.  These are different.  That's my birthstone.  These are really different.  Gifts like the sky blue diamond circle necklace or the sunshine yellow diamond circle necklace.  They start at only $249.  Wouldn't you like it if old Wild Bill picked you up a diamond sky blue necklace?  He won't do that.  He won't.  That's unfortunate.  You can go see the entire collection, Diane, of colored diamonds. 
[04:01:30]  You don't have the internet, so you can go to the library and go online to IHateStevenSinger.com.  Good news for you.  It's on my phone.  It's always fast and free shipping.  Even to you, Lady Di.  Isn't that great?  Yes.  Take my advice.  Get the woman in your life a great gift.  All right.  Steven Singer Jewelers.

[04:02:00]  You going to get something like that?  You going to ask for Bill to get you a little something like that?  I will.  Bill, can you get me a diamond ring?  He said, get the fuck out of here.  Look, on that note, Diane, we're going to take off.  I appreciate you being here.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  No problem, she says.  Goodbye, everybody.
