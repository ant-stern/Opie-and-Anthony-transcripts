<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts discussing Anthony's graphic illness, comparing it to Don Corleone's coughing.  They also mentioned guest Sam Roberts and a missed Twitter DM. The conversation quickly transitioned to soccer, specifically a World Cup game and the controversial anti-gay chants ("puto") from Mexican fans.  Audio of the chant was played, sparking a debate about its meaning and the appropriate response to fan behavior.  A discussion about a seemingly racist KLM airline tweet followed.  Throughout this segment, significant technical difficulties with the phone lines caused considerable stress for the sound engineer, Mars, leading to jokes about his "walkabouts" and hygiene. A motorcycle road rage video was also referenced.

The show then covered Mike Tyson's birthday and BET Awards appearance, along with reports of violence at the after-party and a misspelling of Lionel Richie's name on screen.  Robin Thicke's emotional apologies to his estranged wife were also discussed, with a song clip played.  Numerous listener calls ensued, covering a range of topics including theories about Anthony's illness, car spoilers and speeding, soccer chants (including those about David Beckham and celery), a petition to help a soldier, chants from various sporting events, the New Jersey Devils' goal song change, Jenny McCarthy leaving "The View," and inappropriate chants from Yankee Stadium (including a JFK Jr. version of "O Canada" and a hockey chant).

The next segment tackled the power of offensive language, referencing Russell Brand's comparison of ISIS to Fox News and Whoopi Goldberg's views on "cancel culture."  The hosts debated various offensive terms, including racial and ethnic slurs. A caller discussed absurd White House petitions, particularly one for a Death Star.  The conversation shifted to "fake outrage" and political correctness, referencing mascot and helicopter name changes. A humorous phone call from Chip to Mike Francesa, mocking Francesa's sports knowledge, was played.  A clip of Nancy Grace reporting on a missing child's discovery was shown, leading to discussion of Grace's conduct and speculation about the father's potential involvement.  A lawsuit against Benjamin Moore paint for allegedly offensive paint names was also discussed, along with NBA free agency. The segment concluded with a discussion of the show's "consumer" segment and his product reviews, including a peanut butter porter beer and various Wheat Thins.  Throughout, the hosts continued to make crude jokes and offensive remarks.

The show then featured the "Endless Summer" beer-tasting contest segment.  Caller E-Rock recounted his experiences judging hundreds of beers, detailing negative experiences with homebrew entries and disappointing beers with attractive labels. He described a "Sweet Baby Jesus" beer as terrible, despite some positive reviews.  The discussion covered watermelon beer, craft vs. mass-produced beers, IPAs, and the pretentiousness of some beer aficionados. The previous year's winning beer was described in an ironically over-the-top manner.  The conversation drifted to Crackle bars and ice pops, leading to discussions about Hershey's, its production, Hershey Park, and a Hershey's employee caller confirming larger Crackle bars.  A photo of a rugby player urinating in his own mouth was then mentioned, followed by a commercial break.

Post-break, the conversation returned to Hershey's, focusing on factory closures and outsourcing.  The hosts shared stories about family vacations and their dislike of bed and breakfasts. A caller shared memories of the Fresh Air Fund.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming shows, a "line of the day" discussion, and further commentary on the beer contest, the WWE's "Money in the Bank" pay-per-view, and E-Rock's misuse of the word "copious."

[00:19:00]  world cup this has become a so what do you think it is faggot manikon maybe manikon i think it means  faggot in manikon spanish i think yeah i think they yell it at me a lot i thought it was like a friendly  thing oh no hi guys might have gone hey how you doing in spanish and here at the world cup this has  become a bit of an international issue fifa has looked into it mexican officials have acknowledged  the impossibility of fifa has looked into it what are they gonna do tell them not to do it they can't you

[00:25:30]  that many many are calling racist oh i didn't i was happy that this one came down yeah were you i  certainly was boy after the netherlands uh team secured a controversial last minute victory over  mexico in the world cup the company tweeted adios amigos ned max was the uh hashtag and then they had  a picture of the departures sign with right one of the airports with a photo that features a caricature 
[00:26:00]  icon of a mustachioed mexican uh man in a sombrero where is that it's like a right there that guy oh  i got you yeah who cares oh my god are many really calling that racist everything's racist the tweet was  deleted without apology or explanation after outrage fans began retweeting it in anger in all it was  retweeted over 10 000 times before being removed among the offended was mexican actor gail garcia  bernal who used some harsh language to criticize the airline and vowed never to fly on it again 
[00:26:30]  his tweet klm klm i'm never flying your shitty airline again fuck you big time oh was it that they were  mad about the language or the fact that they lost the game exactly they lost the game so that they're all  of a sudden overly sensitive right like they're yelling faggot in the game yeah exactly they're  yelling faggot at the other guy right oh man i didn't even put all that together yes yeah you got

[00:39:30]  good chant it was like a legitimate chant i used to try to start yeah and uh nobody would and he i remember  everybody was just afraid that it was gonna be so good it would overpower everything oh maybe that's it  you want to do the chant now well it was it was not gonna be the same it was in yankee stadium i would  do it uh-huh when like if the bases were loaded yeah i would try to go and get everybody started i'd go  you gotta strike while the iron's on that wheezing laugh  it's terrible it's bad it's a bad chant it's not bad everything about it wouldn't work 
[00:40:00]  uh dan continue um you said you said something about like the the league you can't punish the  players for crap that the their fans do in japan the hand can be used like a knife  penis can be used as a luck pick  of course you're uh talking about the mexican fans yelling uh i guess faggot yeah in spanish or 
[00:40:30]  something a derogatory term that we did earlier on the show and we say you can't punish the fans  because then you could make believe you're a fan of that team to fuck them over right  well i i don't know that much i just know in japan the fans are hanging up signs in certain sections  that said like japanese only they don't want the round eyes in those sections right i guess and the 
[00:41:00]  the team or the owners of the league i don't even know made the team play it the next game or whatever  in a completely empty stadium nobody was allowed in is there a video of that uh let me uh i'm looking  at a time article i can like tweet it yeah no we'll we'll try to figure it out from here yeah check it  out google they actually played a whole game in an empty stadium and it just proves everybody's racist  by the way they don't want to hang out with round eye of course not why would we in turn 
[00:41:30]  thank you sir we in turn turn uh let's go to eric and there's the empty stadium hold on eric oh come  on hold on a minute eric oh wow looks like the fourth fucking west palm improv oh oh jimmy oh boy  they really did this huh we're watching a game this isn't practice right 
[00:42:00]  in a stadium that looks like it holds at least a hundred thousand people completely empty  oh wow wow yeah that's uh  that was a goal and no one saw it including our radio audience yes colors though it says red and  then white blue it doesn't say no this is part of an article this this is definitely a game that was uh  played in a completely empty stadium because of uh the fans uh not behaving properly well that's 
[00:42:30]  pretty crazy let's say hi to eric in jersey again eric hey what's going on guys hey uh in the new  york red bull stadium when the goal the opposing keeper kicks the ball out the whole crowd screams you  suck at all yeah uh o'leary's scow fc it looks like on twitter just sent me the video watch this all  all right or listen to this

[00:43:30]  no it stinks that's just so much fun for everybody and you know they're going to get rid of all that  shit it's a fun little thing to yell just look at all the crap they took out of the nfl because  because people were having too much fun god for fun god forbid you have fun at a sporting event i don't  think that we need these type of chance i think there's much better ones that we could be doing oh  really yes you got one well well the guy was going to kick the ball yeah yell the a h word oh no no how 
[00:44:00]  about um we hope your kick is steeped in folly  why did anyone yell this is fun that's so stupid bad chance thank you eric hey you got it guys have  a good day anything that feels like it's too much fun they will get rid of yeah absolutely they will  get rid of uh let's say hi to eric in baltimore i think the goalkeeper could handle you suck 
[00:44:30]  asshole but you watch they'll they'll ban that some of us can handle it when it's yelled at us in bed  uh eric yeah um in the netherlands when they play german games they'll chant the thing called  where's my bike where's my bike and it goes back to world war ii when the germans were running home  they stole all the dutch guys bikes to get the hell out of country and they still can't that  they'll take up the game screaming where's my bike to piss off the german guys could you find that 
[00:45:00]  one sam possibly where's my bike i don't think that's the worst thing the nazis did there's another  word that rhymed like that was a little rougher that's the relatives yelling oh right you should  see when he's playing tel aviv it's like where's my artwork where's my artwork were you thinking of  one that might insult the gals no the word that rhymes you got where's my bike or no no oh man

[00:47:00]  i vow to work steeped in every conversation good luck with that one it's steeped in folly  uh let's see we can't find any of these chants no you think if this was happening the youtube would  have a nice uh video of it right yeah the youtube the youtube it's got everything sure uh let's go to 
[00:47:30]  neil in florida neil hey what's up guys hey how you doing this morning um look i'm following actually  that guy that mentioned about uh beckham that's true um they would chant that uh that posh takes it  up the ass yeah um yeah oh yeah i mean that's really that racism actually racism in soccer football  around especially like in the ukraine um and some eastern european countries is absolutely connected with 
[00:48:00]  fascism nazism um all kinds of science i know uh and you're gonna be horrified but they and they  still throw bananas at players bananas yeah they still throw bananas bananas like a daiquiri that's nice  always give me on my accent i've been listening forever you've always but how long have you been in  america all right you know what i tell you what i came here from the uk and served with the military 
[00:48:30]  but what what hold on what year i came over here in 1989 and you still say bananas you know i can  say bananas bananas these guys are in the right to say banana yeah without a doubt bananas i've never  heard that before anyway go ahead sorry sorry listen listen honestly um i actually have a real  so i don't want to bring the show down so i'm gonna try and make it light and fluffy um all right so 
[00:49:00]  you remember lone survivor there was a book written sure yeah all right it was written by a guy named  patrick robinson okay it wasn't written by latrell per se he was in ramadi um so they took this story  and they said you know they worked some things into it and made a book then they made a film  and uh the marky mark yeah yeah yeah marky mark yeah i mean i tell you look there was some things  and i thought and he is his boston accent in that film oh my god people know where we've turned i don't 
[00:49:30]  know yeah we've taken anyway taken a left yeah i'm sorry reason for the call like we've been on  us we've hooked like a banana we're hooked yeah i tell you i feel like a banana because you know i'll  bring it down and i don't want to do that all right then then how you do it yeah you just get into  it let's go go ahead okay whatever the film is what it is in fact i use one word hollywood it is hollywood 
[00:50:00]  all right right period okay look mohammed gulab the guy at the end he he does what it's cool it's  passion wally okay it's traditional over there that they also i don't know where this is going  bro yeah yeah how does this tie i see you need our help but you got her and the banana you got to get  to it it looks like i'll help you out you got a petition that that's going to the white house uh  white house to help a soldier so what's this about that is in danger close of losing his life  there's a bounty on his head there's been two attempts in the last two weeks or so sniper and an idd 
[00:50:30]  to kill him um he's moving from house to house there's other allegations we're not so sure if  those are true or not i've been in correspondence but there's a petition that's going to the white  house right now where are we we've taken this um where is this guy he's in i'm not sure where he's  obviously left the kuna all right all right obviously it's the guy that helped an american soldier 
[00:51:00]  right and he's still over there kind of like they just left him there and his life is very very  uh threatened right by people that want to have him killed so so what is this petition going to do  all right well the petition is going to get him and his family a visa and get him the  out of that okay i got you so credit card for it so what do we actually he's got a month we've got  a month to get a hundred thousand or a hundred thousand signatures i think right and it should be it  should be done now it should be all right all right get one of our own marines out of  fucking mexico and nothing like this administration won't do well what uh what can the fans do quickly 
[00:51:30]  well you guys um look it up google it and and and stay on it send bananas in aluminium  all right it's not a place they could even go what's that  oh my god like a website or something yeah we're trying to help you but you oh yeah you  we need to we need to push everybody to a to a site or something i'll tell you what okay if you 
[00:52:00]  go on you go to um oh jesus i'll tell you what he was talking about anything else we were hung up  on him but you just tweet it and then we'll retweet it i'll tweet you right now all right all right  all right we got we got to go thank you cheers lads thanks neil bye bye bye bye wow that was tedious at  best but tedious at best but if you sign a petition does it actually work no they if if they get i 
[00:52:30]  think it's a hundred thousand well you missed the bathing suit where there's no straps they just showed  it on cnn my god the white house has something if you have a petition with i think it's a hundred  thousand signatures might be two hundred thousand now i don't know right but if uh if you do get that  many signatures then the white house has to acknowledge your petition and you know say and  look into we've looked into it gotcha here's our response um and with the internet these days it's  a lot easier to get that many signatures sure uh to the white house they actually got to increase 
[00:53:00]  the number of people needed for the white house to respond because they were getting the white house  to respond to ridiculous things very easily right um so these petitions don't really do much of  anything uh you're not going to affect public policy just doesn't happen right so uh good luck to you  though that guy all right let's uh let's go to joe uh let's go to the jersey actually joe what's up  jersey jersey joe hey hey yeah i want to talk about the you suck asshole can they already tried to stop that 
[00:53:30]  they try to stop it so yeah why i think i think the goalkeeper can handle hearing that sure yeah the  the front office offered all the supporters groups money to their clubs if they did not do the cheer  we can't handle you suck asshole at a supporting event what if the children that's a great compliment  that's the problem if they love the children so so they can't stop it right now 
[00:54:00]  no people still do it right i think it just makes it more fun if you're at a sporting event who cares  you get a little chuckle of course you do yeah thank you sir i don't think it's necessary though  i think there's just so much more fun ways to tell someone what do you mean you got one like what maybe  they could replace it with one of yours yeah why not like like what we'll outscore you till the cows come  home i like that one that one i'll use it's good it's good he says it's not uh jersey is really 
[00:54:30]  representing on the show today because you know they are stronger than you know stronger than the  storm that's for sure uh let's say hi to mikey mikey hey guys what's going on hey hey  this is sorry about that what's up mike the devils used to have a gold song now whenever they scored  their own chant you suck and when the new owner came in they thought that wasn't uh very nice 
[00:55:00]  so they wanted a more friendly environment so they changed the song oh  all because of you suck all because of you suck they made them change the song  i had to say it i knew everyone was thinking it not you mike no mike's gonna think you did it to mike 
[00:55:30]  no no there's just no there's other no there's other things that we do during a radio show other  things are afoot i don't even know it yes yes i said that i'm pointing at my penis  does that guy even explain it uh uh eric  well eric what's up everyone's in vacation mode oh big time yeah they're all up huh  got the rest of the story on the devil's chant the guy kind of stole my story but it was that song 
[00:56:00]  gary like larry glitter called uh larry glitter roll number two yeah uh hey yeah okay and then at  the end of that they would go you suck but now they changed it to like the white stripes of some  shit wait that's why they changed the song wait so that's why they changed i believe it so the fans  that figured out hey we could do you suck at the end of this because they would play this every time  that they scored and then and then the team goes oh we can't have you people yelling 
[00:56:30]  you suck at a sporting event is that it where it goes in there and it goes you suck probably on the  on the hay where you got fit two words in on where the one hay goes but it's easy yeah i think they  should have just changed it because the guy's a pedophile this makes you want to this makes you want to  pull velcro off little stuff certainly it does you suck yeah yeah no you say hey and then you say 
[00:57:00]  you suck you go hey you suck wait let's try it again hey you suck okay i don't like that at all  that's not i don't know i don't know whether you suck goes yeah yes and then i think they should  just incorporate gyps chants into all the sporting events what i think they should just include gyps  chants in all the sporting events gyps 
[00:57:30]  who's jimmy's chants from before you said you said gyps the guy from bulwark empire season three  he's great did you say gyps yeah all right have a good day oh wow go go bask in your embarrassment  was he yeah really bobby's great he has good cheeks too does he yeah oh yeah yeah yeah that's 
[00:58:00]  right when he was being choked oh god what a great character  why would you change that if everyone's having a good time with it yeah what's wrong with saying  you suck at a sporting event oh no let's say hi to jared in you guessed it jerry jersey  jared interesting hey guys hey so uh uh yeah chelsea football club in europe they uh they have  a chance about sticking celery up a chick's ass to uh to get her off all right that that seems like 
[00:58:30]  it would be a chance that seems like it would be a tough chance sounds like a chance yeah yeah  who starts that and goes i got a champ we we got to work it around the stadium yeah salt a piece  of celery put it where the comes out team team god actually forced the uh stadium to start banning  celery at their games yeah because they bring it and throw it onto the field oh yeah yeah more fun  that they just want to take away who cares if they throw celery on the field every once 
[00:59:00]  in a while gives a shit yeah so the chant goes if she don't come then tickle her up the bum  with a bunch of celery you're awful chance clever sam you have to find that one that one's an easy  one to find yeah it should be just put celery soccer chant i doubt it yeah no this one's going to come  up yeah yeah yeah yeah they actually uh they actually played a friendly game in yankee stadium 
[00:59:30]  the first soccer game to be played there and uh we're in a supporter section and everyone brought  celery here we go here we go here we go you didn't like that story  you don't really like finishing words no sorry wow there you go 
[01:00:00]  no that one's real hooligans right uh we got a bleacher creature on the line watch out  bald vinnie calling from yankee stadium what's up bald vinnie yo good morning good morning  at yankee stadium i don't live there contrary to popular belief  are you uh are you a popular uh bleacher creature i wouldn't know  hang in there yeah whatever i don't know we're all the same thing we're just loud obnoxious assholes  oh look out nice so back in the day you know in the old stadium everything used to go you used to 
[01:00:30]  be able to do uh or say pretty much anything you wanted uh we would do songs and chants that would  make you know pretty much everybody embarrassed wait wait wait give us an example of one you did  at the old stadium just so we know where we're at where where we're at today the basic the basic one  was a song called horse's ass uh very very simple very easy rhythmic uh for example city rock into  that my piazza is a horse's ass he's the meanest he sucks the biggest penis my piazza is a horse's ass 
[01:01:00]  easy quick simple to the point worked really well now you can't even say the word sucks we got i uh  literally got called to the front office at yankee stadium the director of operations and was told that  that we are not allowed to say box seats suck we used to make fun of the guys who sat in the box  seats because they would pay like four times the ticket price that we paid to sit in the bleachers  right it was cool you know back in the day like you paid 28 we played paid six we are cool you are 
[01:01:30]  dicks like dumb stuff like that uh and we would round it out with box seats suck and we were told  everybody is there to enjoy the game uh and you shouldn't make fun of other fans because of  where they choose to sit we haven't we have another rhyme the piazza moment is cool  what's that we have another rhyme like another team song you like the piazza one yeah i mean it was  like at least you could say that stuff i mean it's really uh there were no whole team specific stuff 
[01:02:00]  lost up against the men who's one for the red sox there has to be a good one for the red sox oh yeah  that's a good actually my my absolute favorite one uh which is completely the most inappropriate  thing ever uh was our rewrite of oak canada um which was done the weekend that jfk jr was killed  in a plane crash we call it oak kennedy uh and it's all about how jfk jr couldn't fly well sing it i did  but how did you get get how did it go oh kennedy your plane went down at sea too 
[01:02:30]  fucking bad you're up there with your dad in a flaming wreck you hit the deck and you died instantly  your wife was hot now she's just a spot at the bottom of the deep blue sea you couldn't fly  that's why you died that's why you died oh kennedy your plane went down at sea oh kennedy your plane 
[01:03:00]  went down at sea and the dead air on that explains a lot  he does these impersonations i swear you would think it was the real people  uh yeah 
[01:03:30]  whatever man you at least try to be a little creative and have some fun out there but  they don't like we couldn't get away with any of that in the new stadium uh they don't let you  do that stuff piazzone was good i like bald vitty thanks bald vitty  i don't understand why they don't let you say suck though at stadiums and arenas anymore  uh we got i i why they're just trying to have fun that ruined my day 
[01:04:00]  why he just saw a picture of stealing heidi clomb  yes that'd do it too  wow that's uh we're going back to jersey you enjoy that oh oh is that embarrassing we got jesse i think 
[01:04:30]  jesse and jersey uh-huh uh go ahead hey buddy so the devils they got rid of that old song and i  went through this big old selection process voted in a new song what's the new song is it uh seven  nation army or something yeah yeah okay which a lot of a lot of teams are using sure because they  didn't want you to say uh hey you suck anymore at the devils games i got where where you're going go  ahead yeah well well the punchline is they uh it took about two games for the fans to figure out how 
[01:05:00]  to put you stuck on the end of that too oh oh beautiful good for the fans you sucks easy to  fuck the devil right in there you know got to give you a little credit there yeah if you're watching  the game no one's gonna hold us back man wasn't it more that they didn't want the pedophiles  fucking song being blasted you think that's what the real reason was yeah yeah yeah yeah because  they did yank that song from all sport uh sport yeah you don't hear that anymore anywhere that's

[01:09:00]  kids in this section it was absolutely ridiculous because the same chance were coming from ranger  that's major fans uh-huh i'm a parent now thank god i have a perspective on this i don't care if my  my son here is fuck well i don't care it's other things to worry about what of our society society  society thank you more important things no problem go islanders like the view yeah go islanders 
[01:09:30]  them all getting fired yeah where's my view co-host right show ate them the big show ate them  yeah that's right very good you know what's great about them being fired uh uh who's the the blonde  bimbo jenny mccarthy jenny mccarthy is she gone yeah she had to make believe that she uh was quitting  over the firing of uh the beach ball the human beach ball oh the the the they were firing both of them  but she tweeted something like well you know we gotta stick together so i guess i'm out too i don't know 
[01:10:00]  you're just i don't know her exact tweet but uh she was trying to make believe that it was her  decision sure it was what happened the ratings weren't good sam i guess not so who's left whoopee  whoopee just whoopee whoopee's last man standing whoopee the fuck and i meant that who else did they  fire uh well bob baba barbara left barbara left season and they only had uh three others they're  rotating uh guest co-host right they're not hiring any of them so who's uh rumored to be joining the 
[01:10:30]  why do we care can we move on the view i can tell you the rumors yeah yes oh i saw your tweet  jimmy might be jn they might want me on the view i heard there were three seats available so you know  who's gonna fill them oh big show the big show ah i gotcha whoopee had a little racist remark the  other day you hear that one she said oh there's a typical white male response from some guy that 
[01:11:00]  was debating her about a racial issue what was the racial issue the redskin thing and and words in  general uh the guy was making a valid point and of course you know the race car card must be played must  be this is the clip if you want to hear it last woman standing against fox news host judge janine  piero calling her more dangerous than terrorist group isis he was specifically referring to piero's 
[01:11:30]  comments that the way to deal with isis is to quote bomb them keep bombing them and then bomb them again  russell brand says that he feels this actually creates more terrorists than it kills okay russell  break why do y'all use that picture of russell russell's an idiot though he looks like one  this is so inappropriate russell in this commentary compares isis this group running around the middle  east lopping heads off left and right to fox news who oh they might persuade somebody and i think it's 
[01:12:00]  part of this whole trend we have now we elevate words to the most harmful thing in society how dare you  say something that could offend somebody that's right how dare you say something that could hurt my  feelings why have we gotten to this place let me let me let me tell you let me let me tell you why  well because america has you all right yeah you know because we have a history of utilizing words 
[01:12:30]  words to harm people and hurt people and the people who have been on the other side of it oh black  people at the point where they're saying you know what this is not okay anymore and you gotta you  gotta roll with it because at some point we all have to go look at her duty here her hair looks like  duty there was a time when it was sticks and stones could break my bones but your words cannot hurt you  that's not true that's saying i don't believe in that saying one bit sticks and stones may hurt uh  may break you but words won't ever hurt you words do hurt you words labels can hurt you that's what 
[01:13:00]  you know when you're aware of those words why not just be kind to one another that's the whole point  you've got to be bigger than you know what you can't you cannot say that issue well you what you can  do is say you know what don't use that red skin thing anymore i'm not comfortable with it don't say  this word because i don't like it i'm irish i don't want to hear this every one of these groups has the  absolute uh right right to say the this has been harmful this has hurt my parents this has hurt my 
[01:13:30]  grandparents and don't use it anymore or you're going to hear about or use it and don't be  surprised if people are pissed we'll all stop talking everybody's offended all the time from the  fighting irish to the redskins everybody's offended there you go throw a race in there because if you  are you and then everyone chuckles i would say well what you're saying is you're just being like a  true black woman there there gotcha forget politics yeah i guess there's some sound backstage 
[01:14:00]  where you're i don't know what your background is so i don't even know how to refer to it okay uh 
[01:14:30]  uh where you said you know when i first came here this is what they did to me and this is how  they treated me this is what they did to me this is what they call the argument isn't no no but have  you had that experience no i have not had that she's like okay now shut up you can't argue there's  no such thing as offensive words it's how you react to them you don't shut people up because you  disagree or found something they said somewhat offensive you roll on with your life no you know whoopi  doesn't think her act the shit she says in her act offends people everybody calm down the whole 
[01:15:00]  reason they've been that's how fucking because people just got with the ted dancing blackface yeah  yeah they put out the word nigger people are sensitive don't use it period or use it as an  opening for a discussion like that is hilarious that guy's voice he sounds like a woman  that is the most womanly voice it's ross yeah ross matthews no this is dan 
[01:15:30]  wow the gist though the the fact that whoopi is arguing about words you could probably take any  part of her act and and offend somebody with course and and if you told her look we're offended by this  maybe you shouldn't use that language right she should have every right and and be completely in  the right to say go fuck yourself of course she should know better why do liberals think what  they're saying and doing is the right thing and everyone else is wrong they do what they do and if 
[01:16:00]  you criticize them you're either racist homophobic or all the other list but then they're the ones that  could do and say whatever they please because they're just a little smarter and they know better and how  to use it and they don't have any ill will or malintent in their words that god it's such  bullshit whoopi should be the last one talking about any type of words hurt uh with with being a 
[01:16:30]  comedian and uh you know having an act that could be deemed offensive to certain people well i always  know how to handle that discussion i just jump right up and i say apparently what's good for the  goose is not good for the gander nice brings all together those gander gander americans very angry  at that thing it's it's it's it's it's just amazing you've just reached a horrid point in that and her  saying you know spoken like a true white man it's like you can't just say that you can't discount 
[01:17:00]  everything he's saying because he's a white man and and the fact that his ancestors don't have a  story about how they were brought here and persecuted and treated like shit again doesn't mean he doesn't  have a valid argument that should be heard and weighed with um you know with with an equal scale  to what whoopi is saying it's called a discussion but every time i see people debate like this 
[01:17:30]  the the the liberal side of the argument always falls to something like that well you're not even  qualified to speak about this and if you try we will give you one of those fucking labels racist or  homophobe or misogynistic it's outlandish who's fucking settling for this anymore god this country  let's uh let's go to joe in dc you know those petitions we were talking about earlier 
[01:18:00]  oh yeah this is a little uh a little take on that go ahead joe good morning guys so and explain  hold on and explain that if you get a petition together and you get what a hundred thousand  signatures then the white house the administration has to acknowledge it and at least say they're  looking into it right mm-hmm yeah yeah oh peace boy obama like everything  you son of a bitch oh peace boy go ahead they they had the petitions come up and originally there  were 50 000 and then people started doing you know like uh mcburger king put the right amount of 
[01:18:30]  cheese on the burger people ruined it yeah they ruined it those didn't get any traction but somebody  petitioned for the united states to build a death star which got the requisite amount of signatures  and the administration had to respond and said it was financially impractical to build the death  yeah yeah they had to respond i love no matter what you try to do people figure out how to 
[01:19:00]  fuck with this pre-internet must have been a bitch yeah and then 200 000 that's great yeah that's why  they'll they'll figure out how to pretty much shut down the internet yeah they could be able to handle  the masses all right guys i gotta go i'll punch it out not shut it down but you know what i mean just  completely control us that must have been an amazing time though before the internet when you had to  get one or 50 000 signatures for the white house to acknowledge something you had to get out there  you really had to pound the old pavement that they said boy did you 
[01:19:30]  oh that's just the rob ford rub for he's back huh look at him dancing on the like  oh they're playing shake your booty and playing i guess rob ford's back dancing that's cool good for him  oh no wow yeah we're just i don't know when does when does this end as far as i thought you were  gonna say 10 30 as as far as the the fake outrage and offended and this and the apologies and all 
[01:20:00]  like when does it just end and it turns around to where where people go look this is just it's the way  we talk this is the honest way people talk um you know and if it's offensive to you or it hurts you  words hurt you know as far as your emotions and feelings go sure words hurt they always have you 
[01:20:30]  feel a little like oh man that sucks i was hoping not to be called that or something but that's just  part of language and life in general you're not gonna put a stop to people's basic um instincts and  desires to hurt people with their words that's completely ridiculous it's mike uh mike the marine  from long island mikey hey boys hey hey rob uh some broke over the weekend i don't know if you guys read 
[01:21:00]  this talking about the pc uh washington times there was an op-ed that came out saying that the names of  the u.s army helicopters which are named after native americans apache and tomahawk  what happened though everyone was fine with all this stuff for a really long time and never even  never even thought about it yeah it just was what it was it's the dumbest ever did you hear about the

[01:22:00]  change the names or what uh i don't know uh they're calling it a huge propaganda saying that the names  are racist against native americans and i i don't know i think once again though they pick these names  because of strength yeah yeah an apache helicopter is one of the most it's one of the greatest helicopters  ever made right and it's racist how about we turn those uh fucking apaches loose on some of those  reservations that'll keep them quiet there you go jesus teach them a lesson right all right what do

[01:28:00]  what is it kind of floating around the internet man i don't know you had a missing kid i guess and  oh with the dad yeah and then the dad's on with nancy grace and she's just holding back this info and  just can't wait to tell the dad live on her show she didn't just tell him she had to wait till it was on  the show yes yes that's good she's like good one but her eyes light up like she's like a oh yeah a 
[01:28:30]  vulture she is she's turning into a great video would be her just turning into a cartoon vulture  yeah morph into a cartoon vulture and then he can morph into like some kind of road kill on the side of  the she just starts picking at him right at his carcass that's pretty much what you see happen here  she gets so excited that she's got this news you got look at her eyes jimmy she's a horrible person  i love nancy grace she's a delight she really is a delight 
[01:29:00]  father of the missing 12 year old boy charlie uh with me is his father charlie bothell charlie  we're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement  sir  mr bothell are you are you yeah we are getting reports that your son has been found alive 
[01:29:30]  in your basement what yes that's what if you can hand me that wire she's a horrible person yeah we're  getting that right now she's pretty much this is she's coming right now it's rules she is coming  what's the backstory here the kid was missing for how long 11 days something like that yeah 11 days yes  he's in the basement they didn't check the basement with a lot of like this guy lived  the the the fucking taj mahal a lot of heavy boxes and stuff i know he doesn't live at the alamo 
[01:30:00]  around this area and they're saying that he couldn't have moved these boxes himself into place  so they kind of had him in a little makeshift dungeon i guess um wait wait wait but but how  old's the kid who like 12 i heard yes so a 12 year old can't move some boxes around in the basement  complex yes oh so it's not a house right oh see i was thinking like a white man no and i'm thinking 
[01:30:30]  a basement of a house no those people it's an apartment complex yes ma'am why couldn't he move  the boxes he did apparently he snuck upstairs for food when they weren't home his stepmother put him  down there right and said don't leave no matter what you hear like cinderella right why i don't know  because they're terrible people this guy like allegedly like beat him with a pvc pipe so like  ah so he was probably like oh boy protecting him then or no glad he's gone they're trying to take him 
[01:31:00]  what i would assume so the he's back with his mom right so the mom doesn't get him back so what but  what was this what was this guy doing he was being bad to the kid yeah and they said that i mean there  were all kinds of weird rumors that after this started happening came out about how he was treating him  like that he also was making him do crazy amounts of calisthenics and stuff like that why to stay in  good shape was he eating better maybe that's what it was do you think do you think the dad knew and  then just pretended to be shocked that he was found that's what the general consensus is oh trying to 
[01:31:30]  get him into shape acting i heard his pizza was missing yeah you know where it was where well the big show  ate him come on that's right really it's crazy that was actually the prevailing theory before they  found the kid in the basement didn't know that the big show might have ate the kid where's my kid  the big show ate him all right you think the big show likes pepperoni on his pizza oh i think so  maybe a little uh he gets a little crazy with the pineapple sometimes no no no no sure no pineapple 
[01:32:00]  he might throw some ham on there little ham oh yeah sausage all the meat products oh yeah meat very  meaty pot does he mix up his meats on his pizza you think oh yeah he'll do that sure sure a big show  what about a good uh like uh green pepper or something a little vegetable a little mushroom  or something vegetable shmestable really stuff that comes from the ground extra cheese maybe  for big shows pizza a little extra cheese a little extra cheese a little extra cheese okay  so so so so so this guy is on here talking to nancy grace about his missing kid right 
[01:32:30]  right and then nancy knows that the kid was found in the basement alive right now this dad's freaking  out because his reaction is a little weird well that's everybody thinks it's uh make pretend  make pretend yeah yeah i know we're all this way right we're all this way yuck oh all right  that's a kid you know so who so so now we don't get this oh we're talking about what was she just  getting the news though or no well she probably got the news at some point during the show yeah 
[01:33:00]  but they were coming out of a commercial oh she's holding back hot peppers on uh big show's pizza  as long as they're greasy like the yellow ones the what are they called banana peppers yeah he likes  them with some grease though they're called banana peppers you sure the big show can handle some  spice on his pizza though oh he don't mind a little spice what about a little uh a little  that crushed red pepper he didn't have time for all that when he gets the pizza he eats the pizza  i hate throwing that garlic garlic powder i like a little uh stuff on the pizza no i figure it this 
[01:33:30]  way the pizza guy knows how to make a pizza who am i to say it needs more of this or more of that  always needs more sauce pizza always needs more is that signful no no it's not i'm just why they  always uh can you say chintzy still a little chintzy with the sauce you can't say chintzy what is that  depends me oh what are you with chintz american no it's just chin oh chintzy yeah chintzy as in 
[01:34:00]  clancy i got a clest in me sam  oh my god oh wrestling highlights on fox news maybe they're going to talk about the big show's pizza  sick that would be a great great challenge and for the record the big show doesn't like to order his  own pizza he eats yours he just eats yours broken skull challenge what's the broken skull challenge what is  what is steve austin doing he's got a reality show oh god all right all right we don't great it looks  like survivor and everything else all right we'll have him on though he's a cool guy i gotta know why 
[01:34:30]  this guy reacted this way he doesn't seem happy what the guy who's pizza big show ate no the black guy  on the nancy grace oh we're back on the nancy grace yes but the guy with the kid just heard in his  earpiece somebody told him hey man the big show just ate your pizza back oh man right yes he's pissed off  about that let's see what the boat captain for apocalypse now has to say her facial expressions  are just wonderful nice eyebrows could we uh tweak this out to the people there yeah i gotta i gotta 
[01:35:00]  see the rest of this because he he kind of freaking out i think he might have been like oh this would be  good if the kid's gone because then he can't rat me out for hitting him with a pipe or something right  now real quick before wait a minute steve austin's across the street but were you off with steve austin  no but why because apparently his media tour was a clusterfuck oh well we're never gonna say yes  don't say it like that cluster f yes i was just thinking if uh the hawk who's a big stone the hawk

[01:44:30]  that was 12 monkeys wow good one yeah i remember that good movie  in his father's basement now this is what i don't understand why you guys would have reported he's  missing and all our viewers have been on the lookout for him we've been we've been on the lookout for him  we searched that entire house repeatedly the fbi search detroit police the fbi oh god they brought

[01:46:00]  you wouldn't have to leave it in the car right right so just in case some police call with news of  your missing 12 year old uh perhaps you'd get the call yeah oh boy something's amiss here the last  king of scotland is very surprised  earth wind and fire and 12 year old son  i searched my basement my wife searched my basement the fbi searched my basement the detroit

[01:47:30]  that we are trying to get reports of right now we understand that that we're saying that's his  sister right now yeah i don't know that the police chief is going to make yet another announcement  that should be coming up a little bit later on but yes the boy has been found alive in his father's  basement truck gosh damn well you're going to see some come out of that story i bet yeah i think we  don't know the full story yes oh yeah i like a good happy ending with a missing lad you do oh yeah  it's true how do you mean that i like a good missing lad missing lad yeah because it's rare you know 
[01:48:00]  right there's some shenanigans up on this why wouldn't you leave the set immediately though  and then nancy grace of course doesn't uh you know give the guy a phone knowing that his phone is being  charged in a car somewhere someone handed him the phone at the end yeah oh they did yeah but they had to  wait till they got all their done going for that you know sensationalized of course story and then  all right finally we'll let you uh you know have a phone so you can make some calls got a lawsuit out 
[01:48:30]  of new jersey new jersey man sues benjamin moore over racially offensive paint names paint names uh-oh jimmy  well he's saying that they were named after him personally how what but they weren't right i don't think  so but that's what he's saying so he's a kook i know he worked for them a new jersey man named clinton  tucker key to the story clinton tucker ah same as a transsexual i know tucker 
[01:49:00]  was this close to saying really uh god i held back on that one tucker uh suing former employer  benjamin moore claiming discrimination regarding the paint company's colors clinton brown and tucker chocolate  oh shit wow boom my whole uh bedroom is painted in coon  jesus what the hell's wrong with you that would be a very racist name for a paint 
[01:49:30]  let me have the uh the spit green and the kike yellow over there and give me a little wap blue  i'd like some all i should have been mick green yes of course the mick green and yellow you know  yeah yeah oh yeah yes yes be careful saying that those are well those are truly racist right yes  horrible these i don't think uh they're well let's learn a little bit here tucker who identifies himself  as an african-american man in the lawsuit filed at essic county court in newark said he was hired in june 
[01:50:00]  2011 in the digital marketing department but quickly found himself being discriminated against  tucker is seeking damages for discrimination retaliation and a hostile work environment  he claimed that when working on the online arm of benjamin moore's campaign for their williamsburg  color collection he learned of the new color tucker chocolate which the suit called extremely racially  offensive the williamsburg collection also has colors named tucker orange and tucker gray so that 
[01:50:30]  doesn't mean tucker orange what does that mean was tucker in existence before he got there  tucker then learned of the existing color i don't know yet uh clinton brown which a co-worker  pointed out to him as a joke clinton white on monica's dress that old gag  yeah clinton's green would envy right that that too chipper oh i see what happened here his workers  realized he was a bit of a piss pot uh-huh so go hey they also have a color called clinton brown 
[01:51:00]  oh shit because you know he's uh tucker clinton or yeah clinton tucker whatever his name is  despite tucker's repeated complaints and uh protests to be in management about these appallingly racial  color names no action was ever taken by benjamin moore uh to change the name of these colors according  to the suit tucker also claimed that he was demoted while white co-workers were given promotions  oh man and that his request request to take off work on martin luther king jr day was ignored 
[01:51:30]  oh shit benjamin moore eventually fired tucker in march but retained his two white  blonde-haired and blue eyes subordinates according to the lawsuit goddamn white people so that color  existed before this guy came along there sammy i would say so right this guy sounds like he's trying  to you know milk the old system get a little cashola right so and whitey just merrily skips along 
[01:52:00]  not caring about uh paint color yeah i don't give a fuck who gives a god damn do your job shut up  painting i say painting sucks painting sucks i don't know oh i haven't painted in years but you're  saying painting sucks someone had a great joke about a girl covered in cum said she looked she looked like  a painter's radio yeah yeah that's a good one oh brian in chicago good point here oh hey brian 
[01:52:30]  you think carmelo anthony's going to the bulls oh i'm hoping lebron james goes to the bulls because  i'd like to have a player that doesn't get hurt or doesn't make it all about himself right are you 
[01:53:00]  a broadcasting i hear a broadcasting voice oh thank you yeah hold on the nba is all  fucked up you got lebron james free agent carmelo anthony free agents you got the bosch  a free agent team what the la clippers a free agent team they don't have an owner and dwayne  wade all free agents so like the the party's over miami at least one of those guys is gone  because they're all uh free agents now that's it super team and uh i don't think the knicks have a 
[01:53:30]  shot at lebron james because of the salary the money they got to spend on the lebron  and then you get uh carmelo anthony uh sniffing around seeing where he wants to play maybe for  the bulls maybe back at the knicks maybe with the uh with the uh the lakers i think right  carmelo is actually here in chicago today i know that's why i brought it up oh  you're calling from chicago in there i was trying to do a little local for you right now what's he  doing there there's a little uh meeting he's sniffing around a little meetings sniffing around see if he 
[01:54:00]  wants to be a bull the bulls but these guys all just go for the the team that you know has the best  shot at winning the championship immediately no building that's kind of hard you know believe  it or not lebron james slight chance maybe even more than a slight chance that he goes back to  the cavaliers in cleveland that would be crazy to that city you think they'll put a big picture  of him back up on the building they probably would yeah yeah they probably would and i think sam if  lebron james goes back to cleveland big show's gonna leave his pizza alone really the 
[01:54:30]  fuck yeah you gotta leave his pizza alone at that point lebron orders a lot of pizza and big show  loves how do you know what lebron should order lebron showed her hair plugs yeah right oh my goodness  it's going fast on him oh that uh yeah that hairline's moving aback i mean i don't care but  it's just funny that he's so bummed out by you so with a headband well he went with the double head  double headband which was hilarious because he was trying to start a new trend but it really was because  you know he was trying to cover up some hurt double headband anyway brian what do you got today 
[01:55:00]  on the nancy grace thing if you listen to the beginning of the clip she says they found your  son in the basement she didn't think he was alive until about 30 45 seconds that's true yeah because  that's her she's a she's yes she's horrible you're right that was absolutely she was she was hoping for  that moment she was hoping that he was gonna like is he alive she wanted to build some suspense  right she's fully aware you know if you've got a parent with a missing kid you know they want 
[01:55:30]  to hear found alive immediately yes not it not a pause before the alive part hold on hold on i want  to um hear this and then we'll go back to you go ahead the father of the missing 12 year old boy  charlie uh with me is his father charlie bothell charlie we're getting reports that your son has been  found in your basement 
[01:56:00]  sir  mr bothell are you are you yeah we are getting reports that your son has been found alive see she's the  worst what is he a bitch all right it's it's on this thing by the way because now the father  wouldn't he say immediately alive is he alive is he alive is he okay he just sits there he's like  when your natural assumption to be your kid was found in the basement that he's dead that's what 
[01:56:30]  she's telling you well she's playing her part she doesn't you know she knows it's great tv not to  say alive right at first right but the father should be jumping on and saying alive is he alive yeah but he  sits there just in that shocked look of his because he knows the son's alive and knows the son's in the  basement probably possibly i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt to be honest with you  just just because the way that he went from like better benefits than just doubt want some medical 
[01:57:00]  care dental absolutely yeah the fringe benefits right friends with benefits friends with benefits  yeah the dot benefits don't well we have some benefits for you here's some doubt you know who  like the doubt about this my friend thomas oh god hi brian i love the indian conversation it's just  utter dreck and there's rumors that both parents abused the kid right yeah the kid said he was running 
[01:57:30]  off to a pop lock competition he'd be back in two weeks they'd lock him in the basement poor poor  bastard yeah let's go to chuck in north carolina chuck yeah boys i was going to tell you the reason  all those guys opted out on their their contract so they can pull their money up decide how much  they're going to split it three ways so they can get some better players they couldn't do that  until they opted out and one more thing wait wait wait hold on so you really think those guys are all 
[01:58:00]  going back to the heat next year sure they are they have to do that they have to be able to get that  i think it's 55 mil that they're going to try to give you up between them and then try to get  them a shooting guard or a point guard sign sign sign sign with the heat you got the main three uh  players for the heat all doing free agency yeah and this guy's saying they'll all go back to the 
[01:58:30]  heat sounds very informed on basketball that's such a really weird political stance to take anyway  free agency  wow yeah that's a good one no it was not no it really wasn't uh it's word play that guy didn't sound  like a basketball fan no he didn't maybe college he sounded a bit uh southern southern yeah southern on that  one mm-hmm yeah yeah my chair is very creaky is it i gotta take a leaky if that's any indication on um 
[01:59:00]  you know what we uh need to do i wouldn't mind fucking hauling my giant dick out and leaving us  yeah i want to just unleash that anaconda and uh yeah you know start to chiseling away at some urinal  cakes my friend dean used to say i have to shake the dew off my lily dean is an ass i know he's funny  though yeah he's the one that we went into that black pizzeria lily he's the one that said that get  your cotton picking hands off that salt oh man yeah we're like 16 we just shoveled snow trying to get 
[01:59:30]  money to buy some like blackberry bread and hands oh blackberry brandy yeah that was a man that was a  huge thing to get when you were a kid yeah it was it's blackberry brandy yeah oh nothing better than  that coming back up at you man did that taste like coming through your nose and you're puking  not good no not at all it's not good yeah i gotta take a whiz yeah we should do that why don't we do  that all right all right i love that one that's funny rolling that made me want to eat at that guy's 
[02:00:00]  restaurant though just hearing that he's got he's got some amazing restaurants yummy we wouldn't really  know because we didn't get to eat any of his no no no he made good the next day and it was really  really really really terrific stuff so i'm sure the listeners remember that one steven starr is his name  right yeah and uh good we were uh we were coming into the city yesterday and that gay pride parade was 
[02:00:30]  happening oh right there was a gay it wasn't your car it wasn't was it the gay pride or this lg what  is it it was pride it's pride day heritage day it was like heritage because for some reason i didn't  know the gay pride parade is like different pride colors shine on city do you know how i knew that 
[02:01:00]  because the empire state building had the rainbow colors on the oh did it yes and i asked somebody  what that was oh and um they say that it was gay pride gay yes the gay well they were marching yeah  he lifted his head up and looked out the window okay he was driving she's following me but it's hard  it's hard to take the whole thing seriously when they're wearing like ball bag slings yeah yeah they  look like old school wrestlers with their package fully just engaged people love showing their junk 
[02:01:30]  but if you want to i don't know if you want to get a little more respect and maybe a little more  pride going maybe well you know it's maybe dress down a little bit it's like anything else you know  on saint paddy's day you got a lot of guys uh playing the bagpipes right sure you know they're not  playing the bagpipes any other day of the year they look a little weird they look a little you know like  uh they're from ireland so on the gay parades they kind of gussy themselves up um a little more 
[02:02:00]  flamboyantly so they're saying if you're gay you got to wear the slang well you don't have to but it's  probably recommended you probably should wear the slang maybe wear the slang right you know maybe uh  dress in the rainbow colors very scantily clad maybe be a guy but you want to wear a little halter top  you're allowed it's that day it's your day your gay day the halter top on the guy is just frightening  is that a new one yeah a new fashion ah parades oh boy they love them but um de blasio is out in

[02:18:00]  a jet ski yeah i didn't get the jet ski until i was in my 30s oh and i had a job and i was paying  those bills i i shouldn't have gotten it was it an irresponsible purchase it was an irresponsible  purchase no it wasn't but i did pay off uh those pills that's that's merica for you that is merica  that is america that's america i believe it was actually a sea dew watercraft it was a personal  watercraft not just a jet ski nice it was beautiful and i had a lot of fun on it let's say hi to don in 
[02:18:30]  jersey don don on the phone yes i am what's up john e-rock you are where are those coffins i was supposed  to see we've been holding a uh beer contest for the last 11 years you're holding you hold a beer  contest okay yes every summer at the end of the summer we have our endless summer beer contest  the endless summer hold on let us laugh yeah exactly endless summer beer content sounds great okay what 
[02:19:00]  happens at the endless summer beer contest we're in search of the perfect beer and uh we get why are you  doing it at the end of summer you finally find the perfect beer and then summer's over you should  do it at the beginning of the summer uh we got a party at the beginning of summer we needed something  for the end of the summer all right should switch those around i think you should too party at the  beginning with the beer just the summer you do something a little more uh light uh a little more 
[02:19:30]  light beers maybe right maybe a little lime in there a little orange summer's ending you're thinking  about what kind of fall uh right you want to go heavier exactly you sounds to me like your party  ideas are steeped in folly you might want to introduce a little uh a little pumpkin into your  beer oh when the fall hits it's just before the october fest beers come out so you still got the summer  beers you still got you know it's the endless summer beer contest summer all right so you do that you've 
[02:20:00]  been doing it for 11 years probably 500 beers have been judged and what happens when you finally  announce the beer did does everyone just go nuts you know a lot of people are you know they're upset  that they didn't win they thought theirs was great but the one thing you know what do you win what do  you mean there so everyone brews their own we have a we have a homebrew category nothing worse than a 
[02:20:30]  homebrew beer when someone brings that over and you're just you're just staring at your nice factory  made beer all cold in the fridge you want that and then you gotta drink some guy's swill and he brings  it over in jars or something this is great i i added some peach to the final job shut it good no it's  always bad always bad we're pissing off a lot of beer people that like to craft their own beer  craft crafting my own beer because they got a beer kiss after three and a half weeks if you add in 
[02:21:00]  some brown rice and that really brings out shut up  yeah what do you win sir what's the prize yeah i got it well there's surprises some giveaways and  things like that what do they give you like some some wet naps to fucking take care of your bumper  when you get a little to get a little youngster's hair out of it 
[02:21:30]  anyway terrible so people praise beers and occasionally they don't try them before they  break them and they bring them they know this is great listen look at the name this has got a great  label uh i'll bring this to the party without trying it someone cracks one open it's the worst beer  you've had in an entire year do tell well last year sounds crazy sweet baby jesus and it was just  horrendous uh iraq this calls for you he's saying the sweet baby jesus is horrendous i've got a lot 
[02:22:00]  of responses from people that say that they do love this and have been drinking it for years oh yeah so  everybody's 50 50 on everything oh man but you're saying it's more than 50 50 you said a lot of people  are writing you saying they love it yeah i got a lot i'd be more than 50 50 i never heard of this  beer i picked it up and i tried it and a lot of the feedback that i got was saying that how  people have been drinking this for years and and how great it was here it is because the only people  that would buy this beer are the snobby douchebags that would like say they like it other people if you 
[02:22:30]  just gave this to people that never bought it they'd hate it why you could be a snobby douchebag and not  like it either i don't know i think they're heavier oh it's not okay they're really heavy  where'd you see it you just feel disgusting after you drink one of these beers thick just feel like  creamy was that fairway oh federally it's a good store iraq have you tried the watermelon beer yes i've  been i did a review and i've been recommending it for a long time i had one over the weekend  watermelon from the 21st amendment in san francisco exact that's the exact uh can i had over the weekend 
[02:23:00]  i fucking hated it do you like the watermelon watermelon i don't either i'm a big fan of the  watermelon i like a couple of taste oh that's good oh delicious i'm done with this crap yeah yeah i go  very hot and cold with i'm not a fan of watermelon i'm doing a whole podcast on it  although watermelon with a little feta cheese ain't what try it cheese and watermelon now you're  talking crazy that's not too bad putting those two things together iraq 21st amendment's got so 
[02:23:30]  many other beers why did you pick the watermelon beer because it was fucking available you douchebag  this is a guy that look and i'm sure he drinks beer for many years and knows what he's talking  about but if it's not exactly what he likes right everything sucks right i put it out there saying i'd  enjoy it you should try it for yourself and see wow not that this is the best beer ever and everything  else sucks there's so many better ones i hate that when people are just like trying for yourself i 
[02:24:00]  don't personally like it or i do like it i'm with don on the watermelon beer i hated it i really did  at least he tried it that's a good is this a good beer before or after a bag of treats oh  fuck you're on spit in your face you snob oh  drinking your growler with your pinky in your air you asshole oh  oh pinky in your air how is your pinky in your air here what you need to look you need to look  a toe to cleanse your palate after you drink that beer it was so nasty it's swiss it around in your 
[02:24:30]  mouth feel every hop you don't like uh the beer snobs iraq no they are the worst you get beer snobs  who are people who just like as they call it you know your corporate beers budweiser and whatnot and then  you get your beer snobs on the other end who are so far into the craft beer world that if it's not  specifically tailored to like hops from this region or brewed this way that everything in between 
[02:25:00]  fucking sucks so you got to find a balance in the middle where you'll drink a cores and then you'll  drink something i'm not from one of these independent brewers i'm not a fan of like the basic beers like  uh your your miller your your budweiser some of them other doors mo you know i'm not a fan of any  of that shit who loves miller danny he buys that new uh black label uh but just drinks the closet  alone i do have a butt yeah but i tried that uh jesus oh yeah jesus you just can't be left hanging 
[02:25:30]  out there like that that's for sure that's why you're trying to like oh very quickly on this show  wow you can't pause for nothing uh but discovered the goddamn bud lime oh are you liking the bud lime  do you do the bud lime no i'm just a bud or bud like the bud goes and i like the better than the 
[02:26:00]  corona with the lime in really i really like that one a lot what says you the consumer  no that's consumer you don't like bud lime no why stuff with lime already in it is usually not that  because they give you a little more lime than you could do with with on your own with the oh yeah  the lime slices i think a lot of people like the um are you doing the limerita that thing from bud  wise no no that's like a raspberry thing too uh yeah the limeritas i had those before it's like  a like yeah a little margarita action it's not good either no that i didn't like that margarita 
[02:26:30]  needs tequila what's a better beer that this guy says like that you should have liked from that  oh no here's the problem it doesn't matter because what if you talk to anybody who doesn't  oh uh well i like that watermelon beer for the first amendment yeah it's actually really good for  the summer for this pretentious name of a beer that he's going to yeah go ahead don what's better  than the watermelon beer from that company uh they got black ipa and then there's a uh let's see they've got  the uh live theory or dies got the uh like an ipa that's good so i mean it was just of all the beers 
[02:27:00]  all right i gotta go to when you go to a bar and they go oh we got a good ipa on draft do you get  excited i hate it and then they force you to get it you get it it's like ew this doesn't taste like  what i'm used to i just want a cold bud just give me a cold bud at the bar i'm fine just want to let  you know we have some good i'm not yeah i'm not there to have a drink uh a taste experience 
[02:27:30]  i had a dinner i'm there to just drink cold beer until i fall down you know our ipas are outstanding  we have a good ipa today like their beer changes every day like that matters sometimes they do god  beer snobs can't stand what's an ipa indian pale ale it's a way of it's a way of brewing beer indian  different style i'm like there's some good beginner ones out there like the sam abbott's  beginner beginner what's a big i need a beginner ipa it's bottled with training wheels right i gotta 
[02:28:00]  i gotta train my taste buds yeah yeah to the real ipa i'm not good enough to judge if this is good or not  only take one training wheel off my bicycle don't drink too much and then let's talk about it for 20  minutes yeah he said a beginner ipa what's wrong with you don why would you need a beginner ipa  sometimes the ones that are double hop and triple hop it's just too much flavor for people i enjoy a 
[02:28:30]  good triple hop what about you for people what about you oh a good triple hop do you have any triple hops  yes yeah on tap please  i do like to try a little beer here and there but not this deep no this is like what's the difference  between a double hop and a triple hop one hop  tell us there i think that's a skip there chipper tell us 
[02:29:00]  tell us what's the difference between a double hop and a triple hop  well the way he smiles at you he's laughing you throw in while you're while you're brewing it  it's just boiling and then oh god so jacking off talking about this shit so who won the uh endless uh  endless summer beer contest last year what beer was it it was uh from uh main brewing company and it was 
[02:29:30]  called zoe c-o-e it was uh pretentious what did it taste like uh i don't know i think i sampled about  50 beers at that point kind of a zoe were you a judge yes and you don't even know what the winning  beer tasted like last year yeah it was it was good it was better than second and third place  there you go you want the description of uh zoe of zoe yeah let's hear this thanks don we're 
[02:30:00]  gonna let you go it says our take on an american amber ale complex malt bill delivers notes of dark  raisin chocolate and biscuit come on shut up copious amounts of american hops yield notes of pine and some  citrus but i'll tell you this much yield notes my taste buds suck when they do this with wine there's  a hint of chocolate and a hint of peach yes i don't taste any of that in wine or beer you could 
[02:30:30]  taste the no you can't right it's just kind of good or bad hint of coffee yeah coffee beans what yes you  want to make it stand out here's a nice ale with a hint of crushed glass see if you can notice that  you should always try something you don't have to like it but just at least try it i do try but i i'm  talking about the people that go way too deep right i probably would try the sweet baby jesus just  because of your review on your instagram i'll be trying you're pretty much one and done with that 
[02:31:00]  you drink one and it's like you can't drink more than one why have it around that's a treat oh treat  well that's why the alcohol content is way up there yeah yeah you sip one on a on a hot summer afternoon  i couldn't imagine fucking baking outside and you grab a nice bottle of of syrup it just pours  like tar yeah iraq before we wrap this up yes i have found over the years the the nicer the label 
[02:31:30]  the shittier the beer hmm oh yeah i don't know yet i'm still kind of when you see those really cool  labels it usually means the beer stinks yes and no so what do you need like them like there's a  really out on long island called uh in blue point called blue point brewery that has really nice  labels but all their stuff is really good yeah i like blue point they got a nice blueberry ale that  you would like no i don't want a blueberry ale but you don't eat blueberries he was talking about me

[02:35:00]  summer guys who have a party no that's why i like eroc's bit because he's like you know he's  is a regular consumer he's not getting too serious with this no exactly thank you buddy honest  assessment sure was that all you uh review i don't need to hear about japanese stuff today  that was eat that was it the wheat thins and the uh sweet baby jesus no and there were some japanese  candies that i just said i don't need to hear about the japanese candies but no we need to talk about the  japanese candies why good the japanese are psychotic they sell a candy made with toddler clits 
[02:35:30]  yeah it tasted like a toenail what i thought they were just tic tacs they sell a candy where the  translation is russian roulette gum oh and it's three pieces of uh whatever flavor they're selling  and two of the pieces are normal gum that have a little bit of that gel in the middle yeah  gum gum but one piece of the gum is is the mystery one that's so extremely sour and bad just to 
[02:36:00]  fuck with you spearmint so fruit a kid will take these little pieces and eat all of it at once  and then all of a sudden you like you're spitting it out because it's horrible vomit taste so what's  the point of this uh trick a chicka missif that leads to the uh what's the sour candy that they do  those youtube videos about where they it's hard to actually eat them or it's too sour yeah yeah warheads  is it the warheads i think it's called the warhead challenge or something like that no way yeah the 
[02:36:30]  videos are kind of kind of funny well how big is a warhead yeah you know like one of those giant  fucking jawbreakers i remember fireballs they used to hurt fireballs i think they calmed down the fireball  they did over the years they did right put that in if you put it like in your cheek it felt like it was  burning a hole through your fucking cheek it was terrible you got nowhere to put it your tongue's  burning same thing with big red the big red gum big red go remember the song called big red right 
[02:37:00]  with the bold clean bite they had to change it though because it just got weird commit hate crimes a  little longer so let's beat your kids a little longer longer with big red that big red freshness  let's right through it your fresh breath goes on and on while you chew it say goodbye a little  longer make it last a little longer burn that cross a little longer with big red damn yeah weird what 
[02:37:30]  went there no great stuff uh what that's it with the candy the japanese candy well the russian roulette one  and then um the other one is that's not too crazy i can see where kids would be into that sure i don't  know how you would be into it they don't tell you which one is the that's the fun part tell you  that's the russian roulette you ruin everything but you're a kid it's kind of exciting you want  the weird one it would be marked and where's the surprise in that you give it to your friends and  you hope the spaz gets the bad right right and you all laugh at him look at what happened

[02:46:00]  the amount of freight from another country you couldn't sell it at a reasonable price in this  country there are four factories in pa there's the kiss factory there's the original factory we just  opened a new one there the reese plant is there then in lancaster is the twizzler plant so i want to  know where you're here is the plant years ago well far god that's a lot of twizzlers coming out of  there i'd like to see that on how it's made what about the kiss plant i know just for the kiss 
[02:46:30]  just for the kisses how much do you hate uh chocolate at this point jason  be honest all right a lot i like it you know the hershey organization is a fine company to work  for i love her on five four company line company line company line right i guess you don't want a  box of samples is what you're saying oh okay well are you guys getting are you guys getting fancy  with your with your product like everybody else yeah really there's there's no it's we're pretty 
[02:47:00]  no real changes affordable affordable stuff nothing crazy that we tried the crazy stuff but it didn't  do very well like what well years ago we had the starbucks chocolate didn't do so hot uh we had a  couple like this stuff you know or it's pure cacao you know that the bean and that didn't do well  you know four or five bucks a bar sir is there a hershey highway uh somewhere i would imagine maybe  pennsylvania i would think it would be cool to you know have your nav go get on the hershey highway 
[02:47:30]  take the hershey highway 3.4 miles yeah have you been to hershey pennsylvania we went once  growing up i've never been the sidewalks are like the color chocolate right sir oh  no we tell them the white poster kisses in main street yeah uh-huh but it's a fun place  and that's like the whole town not just like where the amusement park you think i hear their 
[02:48:00]  their park has gotten way better i've heard the park is cool i was there i get there about once a  year i used i grew up in new york i used to go every summer too like no but i get there what  route would you take to get there hi jim hi opie you're 100 wrong i live in hershey pennsylvania  right across the street from the chocolate and peanut butter plant when the wind blows out of the north  it smells like chocolate when it comes out of the west it smells like peanut butter you know what  happens you're hungry 24 hours a day sounds to me like your address should be 1010 heaven street 
[02:48:30]  i guess this would be a good time to tell you that i just decided yeah  yeah that's good just to piss off the hershey guy you'd think they'd put an asphalt plant right to  the north so that the wind blows and just ruins everything yeah i know i would there yeah put  there in a manure plant or something oh no oh no bills can fill the fish and pour it and just move in 
[02:49:00]  right next to the shoot just ruin everybody's good time oh no the herrings are coming in  uh-oh guy who works for hershey is full of shit here it comes mike from hershey pennsylvania yes  good morning guys yeah i live in the area and uh the original plant that he's talking about is sold  and 90 torn down they're turning the rest of that into offices yeah the the new plant they've built  they've already decreased the production in that plant by 50 and they've shipped about 
[02:49:30]  25 percent of their equipment out through remanufacturing companies to remand the equipment  before sending it to mexico this would be a see this would be a good point to tell you that uh  i was i was just joking it was joking that i was making up this the story i actually did hear they  are outsourcing something that they're outsourcing their oh man chocolate i actually just read an  article i found an article i found out what happened to all the crackle bars yes uh the big show 
[02:50:00]  ate them god damn it the big show i didn't see that comment he enjoys a good crackle bar at  before after or during his pizza uh yes is the answer to that question really yep oh is it true  that there is a um a little league team uh they're called the hershey squirts they're little kids  they're little kids well well depend on the restaurant you know where you are there it is thank you captain  obviously everything down there including yeah right but i'm i'm getting worried that they are 
[02:50:30]  tearing down the the the factories oh man here in allentown hershey yeah oh i'm enjoy  chromium steel yeah how do you make a song out of that springsteen mayor taking all the chocolate  out of cheese some working man blue collar song about uh how hershey isn't as uh knee deep in nougat

[02:51:30]  disney uh we never got there as kids not well as kids yeah i went there once our vacation uncle tony our  vacations are just very long rides really yeah so you you drive down there was no destination i don't  think i think they made up the destination like we drove all the way up to maine once did you end  up in a motel though somewhere yeah like a bed and breakfast or something and we're like hey we're  here like okay now what there was nothing to do there kids in a bed and breakfast terrible yeah with  kids and long ride intrusive on anyone else that wants to stay there they're stupid anyway for wanting 
[02:52:00]  to stay at a bed and breakfast seven kids too but imagine you're there with your girl it's gonna be  great no it's a very homey atmosphere and seven of the hughes are running around like animals all  all a year apart right down the line all wound up on margin and sugar sandwiches  that was our trips growing up though oh they had no destination i finally figured that out as an  adult and then we would stop to do like uh what i like to call drive by nature oh there's a waterfall 
[02:52:30]  and they pull over and we walk in like a quarter mile see a waterfall take pictures and get back in the  the car that was our trips that's a vacation pretty much yikes like bed and breakfast oof terrible i  can't imagine the way i leave a hotel room it's like i'm i'm fleeing i i don't mind i could like  i'm on the lamb oh no i don't mind i don't be in someone's house i don't want to have to yeah think  about anything in a hotel you know what's great about a hotel you're in the shower right and you're 
[02:53:00]  washing your undercarriage the last thing you do in the shower you get that washcloth and you just  rock rock rock sure at home you got to make sure now that you clean the wash pillow ring it out rinse  it i take that thing and flock flock with ass hairs still in the washcloth flock against the wall because  i know you're so angry all the time what's wrong with you no because i smile it's a happy moment why 
[02:53:30]  do you have to throw it violently against the wall because that's sound and the fact that i know i  don't have to clean deal with it and clean it up and then towels fuck it one on the floor one on my  head one of my shoulders one around my waist look like a shake you don't like a good bed and breakfast  where they announce that breakfast will be at nine and they make breakfast breakfast will be at nine  i'll still be puking up my hangover really uh until one or they could you have breakfast at one  130p or they put out tea around three in the afternoon hey you don't like that i can't stand 
[02:54:00]  with little finger sandwiches oh my god this is a nightmare it fucking stinks i hate a bed and  breakfast you don't like that no little finger sandwich and a cup of tea and then you're sleeping  with your chick in someone's house basically their bed yeah what about some fucking what about when that  fucking starts you're in a hotel you don't care you're in someone's house it's like yeah you know 
[02:54:30]  and they're probably jacking on the other side of the wall but everyone else is squeaking right along  from their room you think maybe not yeah they pencil in sex time sex time bed and breakfast i don't know  man 30 10 30 you start it's just creepy to stay in someone's house like that i didn't mind it yeah  every once in a while you broke it up we've definitely stayed at bed and breakfasts and you go every  every room you can hear people having sex in at some point during i don't doubt it yeah did you go  to a bed and breakfast where you got to share the bathroom come on no no way oh yeah did you go that's 
[02:55:00]  just going to somebody's house it's not even a real bed and just sit down on a warm toilet seat like  ew someone was here ah yeah you got to share a bath because a lot of times they were just in old houses  and stuff you really get you got to piss real bad and then some old guy is getting out with a rolled  up newspaper how you doing you know you just spent the whole morning in there oh yeah moving  his bowels oh i could never no why let's say hi to arty on uh long island or in long island i like 
[02:55:30]  to say on long island yeah i say under under long island makes no sense all right hey yeah how you  doing hey opie did you by chance the church you used to go to be in smithtown or st thomas or  canterbury i don't know we had to go to church all over the place for a while all right no i'm from  uh centerport originally yeah no we used to go to this one church and it was a family just like yours 
[02:56:00]  uh there but we i come from the same thing well we you know so i can bus right now we used to do camp  alvernia and you know camp alvernia and the famous where we all brought our blacks over to the pool  for pool day that was for the um fresh air fund yeah like our community our our very uh catholic uh  community thought it was it was a good thing to you know inner city kids rent a black for a weekend  and then you felt like you're really helping her and her family even though it was a quick little 
[02:56:30]  getaway for the kid and that was it you never heard or saw them ever again but they all would  would would be kind of it was almost like you were showing how big your dick was you would bring the  black kid to the camp alvernia pool day look at mine right i remember it i was a little kid  inner city kids would come out to the country which was long island and uh they would live with a  family for a little while i don't think ours i don't think it was officially well it was the same  type of deal same type of deal fresh air fund remember the commercials online oh yeah could you find 
[02:57:00]  an old fresh air fund commercial sometimes i may believe i play buffet yeah i remember that commercial  for the fresh air fund they would uh very old yeah they really wanted you to rent a black they uh liked  the uh thought of the the inner city kids coming out to the country right and uh man it's an old commercial  here we go oh boy swimming fishing frolicking he's walking through a interspersed of them walking 
[02:57:30]  through a horrible part of the city for two weeks every summer the fresh air fund sends city kids to the  country were they terrorized country kids just hilarious they would use to just yeah black kids  go to share and that wasn't even an old one i remember the old old old ones from like the early 70s  perhaps see if you can find an old one in the late 60s but it was we didn't have ours for two weeks no 
[02:58:00]  we got was it daily we got shit so they get gypped that was 91 91 yeah come on we're looking way back  19 uh 22. all right already gotta let you go yeah your phone is making some wacky noises like vinyl or  something yeah that was a vinyl call all right we got a vinyl call you got an older uh fresh air fund  commercial the fresh air fund 91 is as old all right then we're getting the out of here then new york 
[02:58:30]  if you can't find one inner city youth this is new too oh this is very oh this is new fangled  kids went with a butterfly on the projects yeah good luck get the shipping out of them  you know i'm gonna go old school i'm gonna get a fresh air fun kid yeah this is tiki barber for  the fresh air hi children who have never experienced the country can when you call to host a fresh air  front child i should do that we should all do that wouldn't that be nice two weeks though have 
[02:59:00]  a kid over at the compound for a couple weeks could we blindfold them so they don't know where  we live when well i don't think that's necessary you could go out to the beach house you could take  them out to the beach house teach them how to uh blindfold them no i think it's okay that's pretty far  yeah yeah yeah and then you know have one at the compound yeah i think it would be a nice thing to  do how do they how do they like know that people aren't like pedophiles or creeps right imagine i 
[02:59:30]  would imagine a background check i would imagine there's some horror stories uh associated i'm not  saying with the fresh air fund but yeah maybe uh organizations sort of like that i don't know it  would be a little scary it's like just fucking it's like a it's a good dating service you know  they just send over an escort for you yeah can i get a spanish one between the ages of two and three  you're right what's the screening process what is i want to get back what do i do is there a site 
[03:00:00]  go to the site go to the fresh air fund site you know and see uh what the criteria is to rent a kid  for a summer or something a couple weeks the fresh air uh fresh air dot org oh in a second you would  hey what wait a minute i see white kids what's that about they want you to they want you to  to dial in yeah the white kids are the ones that are hosting yeah oh see i didn't they got to play

[03:01:00]  oh yeah yeah i remember that on a front my brother's telling me this is the uh the fresh air  fund commercial where the kid goes uh it's like this voice over this this uh guy with a very  broadcasty voice and he's talking to this black kid and he goes uh have you ever seen a cow and he  goes uh yeah because you've seen a cow he goes yeah where on a farm on a farm on tv on tv oh yeah
