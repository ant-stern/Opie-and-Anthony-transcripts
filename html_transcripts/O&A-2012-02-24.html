<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie detailing the challenges of finding a co-host due to past conflicts, recounting a story about a lavish Atlanta dinner following a prank on a Boston mayor.  This led to a discussion about SiriusXM's recent signing of Fran Tarkington and the resulting resentment amongst existing, allegedly underpaid talent.  The hosts contrasted their experiences with the preferential treatment afforded to big-name guests at SiriusXM, sharing anecdotes about encounters with Oprah, George Lucas, the Jonas Brothers, and awkward restroom run-ins with Quincy Jones and Ben Stiller.  They then discussed Eastside Dave's appearance on TruTV's "World's Smartest Invention," specifically a "Subtlebutt" commercial also featuring Todd Bridges and Tonya Harding. Linsanity and the Knicks' recent loss, along with LeBron James' move to Miami, were also briefly touched upon.  A significant portion focused on an immature, heavy-drinking female coworker's upcoming marriage, with the hosts expressing skepticism about its longevity. Ronnie B was a studio guest throughout this segment.  The show concluded this initial segment with reactions to user-submitted videos: one of a man arguing over $2 in a fast-food restaurant, and another of a man wielding a long chain in NYC, sparking a conversation about New Yorkers' obliviousness to unusual events.


The next segment began with a discussion of a video depicting a racial slur-laced altercation between a customer and a store employee, followed by a caller's account of a calm and quick-thinking response to an armed individual.  The caller then detailed past scams and illegal activities from his time working at a hotel.  This transitioned into a live read for ESTmen.com, an Ashley Madison-esque website, with the hosts expressing uncertainty and debate about its deceptive nature.  Paul Mercurio's absence was explained as a scheduling mishap between Opie and Sam.  Further discussion included Opie's attempts to rebuild bridges with Jeremy and Ken; criticisms (using offensive language) of colleagues' work ethic at SiriusXM; a video showcasing Al Dukes' failed attempt to appease Opie with a pinball machine (which Opie subsequently destroyed); Sam's pinball aspirations; Jim Jefferies' late arrival due to travel issues; Jim Jefferies' experience performing at a Little People of America convention, prompting a discussion on appropriate terminology for dwarfism;  and a comparison of suburban versus city life (with several derogatory remarks about various groups).  Ronnie B remained in studio, joined later by Jim Jefferies.


The following segment started with a humorous anecdote about helping a blind person cross the street, moving into a critique of US currency and a supposed anecdote about Ray Charles' payment in only dollar bills.  The conversation then flowed to the difficulties of using coins for tipping, a prank involving a sock full of change, and a host’s upcoming Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, leading to discussions on bungee jumping (including a gruesome accident anecdote), "Idiot Abroad," and a tribal bungee jumping ritual.  Kevin Pollack joined the show, complaining about the scarcity of Entenmann's crumb cake, prompting a debate about chocolate chips and a rant about gluten-free products.  Further anecdotes included one host dating Michael Phelps' ex-girlfriend.  The conversation continued to meander through various topics, including the challenges of celebrity, news anchor preferences, a vomiting game show contestant, and a proposed website featuring "hot chicks doing weird shit."  Pollack discussed his upcoming Oscar party broadcast, and the "walk of shame" at award ceremonies followed by reminiscing about "The Usual Suspects" cast at Cannes.


A significant portion then focused on the Asian American Journalists Association's guidelines for discussing Jeremy Lin, sparking a debate on the guidelines' absurdity and effectiveness, and expanding into broader discussions on race and offensive language. This transitioned into a discussion of words banned from their radio show, mirroring a previous "Words Hurt" pamphlet from their lawyers, comparing American and Australian political discourse.


The next segment heavily featured a discussion of banned words and phrases, with Kevin Pollack and Ron Bennington joining the conversation.  They recited a list of banned words and phrases, highlighting the absurdity and double standards.  Pollack discussed his extensive film career (mentioning 66 films), sharing anecdotes about working with Walter Matthau and Sophia Loren (including an inappropriate anecdote).  They dissected examples of allegedly racist advertising, specifically Australian commercials for Coon cheese and Nigga Boy soap.  Much of the latter half revolved around a mysterious upcoming announcement withheld by Ron Bennington.  Other topics included parenting difficulties, remaking classic comedies, Sean Connery's *Hunt for Red October* accent, *Heil Honey, I'm Home*, and a large sandwich delivery.


The final segment focused on Al Pacino's acting career, debating a perceived shift in his vocal style and acting choices, referencing specific films.  The conversation included tangents about Beverly D’Angelo's appearance, a dinner party at Frank Zappa's ex-wife's house, and comparisons between Al Pacino's and Jim Carrey's career choices.  Ron Bennington and Kevin Pollak were guests, with Pollak sharing anecdotes about his own career, the pressures of Hollywood, and the challenges of transitioning between comedic and dramatic roles. The show concluded with promotional plugs for Bennington's Oscar show and Pollak and Jim Jefferies' stand-up performances, mentioning a future chat show appearance and a "TweetRoast.com" event.  Numerous sandwich trays from "DeFontes" were delivered and interacted with throughout this segment. Crude and vulgar language was prevalent throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's do this! 
[00:00:30]  I begged and I got Ronnie B. to come back in today.  You really did beg. Not just you, but you had your people.  We were all scrambling yesterday.  And here I am.  I mean, scrambling. This show, you know, there's a lot of working parts.  And, you know, I'll take a day or two and Ant will do the show with somebody.  Jimmy's out. And we just kind of scramble and figure it out.  Yesterday was the first time that I went down the list and had absolutely no one to do the radio show with today.  Have you burned that many bridges now? Is that where we are? 
[00:01:00]  That people are saying, I will not take Opie's call. I trusted him.  I came in there as a friend.  We haven't talked a lot off air. I have rebuilt some bridges, sir.  Is that right?  I have rebuilt some bridges. Not all of them.  But I could get to some islands again.  Is that important to you? Because you will or will you re-burn those same bridges?  I'll probably re-burn them. It's fun. It's fun to burn bridges. 
[00:01:30]  So the thing about Opie is he burns bridges before he crosses them.  Yes.  Like not after.  Like I've come to the bridge. I'm going to burn it down.  And then let's figure out how we get across this raging river.  There are a lot of times I'm burning bridges realizing, oh, shit, I still need that bridge.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  They say that self-destruction is very good for you, though.  They do.  It keeps you scrambling. It keeps you thinking.  Did you ever hear the story when me and Ant went to Atlanta after we blew it up in Boston with the mayor's prank? 
[00:02:00]  We go down to Atlanta because they want to hire us down there.  I forgot the rock station.  And the consultant for AF is down there.  And he's like, hey, man, you're down here.  I want to take you guys out.  I'm like, great.  So he takes us out to a really nice steak dinner.  We see Fran Tarkington with two babes in the steak place.  We're having a great night.  By the way, Fran's going to be doing a show here, I read.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Mars just nodded. 
[00:02:30]  No, I'm sorry.  Chris Webber's doing a show.  You did nod.  For a second.  You nodded like, yeah, I know this info.  And I'm looking at Ronnie going, obviously, this is a joke.  It's possible because Chris Webber's doing a show.  No, I know Ronnie was going for a joke.  No, I wasn't.  Fran Tarkington's doing a show here.  No, you shut up.  Go and check, Sam.  Wait, this isn't a joke.  No.  But you...  I don't know about Fran Tarkington.  I know about Fran Tarkington.  Frank?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Fran Tarkington.  The great Fran Tarkington. 
[00:03:00]  Wait, now I'm all confused because I'm assuming it's a joke by Ronnie, but then I see Mars  in the background nodding, but now Mars is nodding because he thought you said Chris Webber,  which is very similar to Frank Tarkington.  Holy shit, you're right.  No, Fran Tarkington is going to be on SiriusXM Stars 2.  Why?  It's called Let's Scramble with 1960s great Fran Tarkington.  Now, I don't know what the name of the show is, but he was like on Monday Night Football 
[00:03:30]  in the 70s.  Sure.  I mean, it's been a long time.  A really long time.  Since anybody said, what's Fran Tarkington up to?  What kind of show is he going to do?  I thought Ronnie was lying.  Does the company realize we got some contracts coming up?  I mean, you and Fez, I believe, are up or very close.  We're getting there, and they're wasting our money on shit.  Sorry.  You don't have to join this.  You don't have to join this bitch. 
[00:04:00]  Then I remember in 1968 when we played the Eagles.  What could he possibly be doing?  This is a show that my dad will be glad to watch.  My dad's like, oh my God.  Right.  Got Tarkington.  Fran Tarkington joined SiriusXM Stars 2 lineup.  Or as Mars calls him, Frank Tarkington.  Frank.  Good old Frank.  Imagine how Matt Mars would get if we fucked up a bullfighter's name.  What is his background?  Does anybody know?  We think he's Puerto Rican. 
[00:04:30]  He's Dominican, I bet.  No, don't say that, man.  They get mad.  Puerto Ricans get mad if you call them Dominicans.  Like, I have to tell you that.  What is he going to do, this friend Tarkington?  He's going to talk about football.  I don't think so.  He's a long-time advocate of entrepreneurship and creative thinking.  And a huge fan of talk radio. 
[00:05:00]  Boo!  So this opportunity is a big thrill for him.  Oh my God.  Are you...  When it comes time for contracts, yeah, we don't really have more money for you.  Fortunately, there's just...  We signed Frank Tarkington.  There's no new talent out there, so they need to hire...  Guys that are in their 80s.  Yeah.  If I was him, I'd call it Tark Radio.  Right.  I'd try to go...  I like any wordplay in the name.  Yeah.  How about you stop signing these fringe fucking guys that have never done radio and take care  of the people that are already here? 
[00:05:30]  No.  A lot of people need raises.  They certainly could take Frank Tarkington's money and spread it around.  Like, fucking Sam is going to watch him count money while Sam walks down the hall later  on doing his eight shows.  Yeah.  And there's Tarkington.  Right.  Radio's easy, huh?  So, I come in here for an hour a week, I make gigantic money!  Advocating entrepreneurship on the air.  And how long is Frank Tarkington's show going to be?  Oh, it's a two-hour or three-hour...  Really?  Weekly. 
[00:06:00]  Weekly.  Mondays.  Three hours a week.  Six to nine p.m. on Mondays.  But I asked for a little break from these guys, like, oh, what, you're losing your passion  for radio?  That's what I heard last contract.  What, are you losing your passion for radio?  Because I wanted to, like, start a little later.  I didn't even want to, like, cut down the amount of hours I do.  Oh, Mel thinks that you're losing your passion for radio.  That's what I had to hear from that idiot down the hall.  And then they sign guys that do three hours of radio a week.  A week.  All right, what kind of business are you starting? 
[00:06:30]  Those are always the best show.  Oh, my.  Is that really what he's going to do?  All right, here's what you need to do.  Turn your family into a corporation and rent your son's room back to them.  Remember those shows that used to be on AM?  They would come up with a million ways.  Here's how you get by.  He's also an advocate of creative thinking, so there may be some of that, too.  So are we.  Oh.  We're great creative thinkers.  I'll tell you this.  He should do a fucking show on how to get a three-hour radio show on satellite.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe we should have him not negotiate our deal.  Actually, just sit around and talk about old football.  Wouldn't you rather hear him talk about the old Vikings than this?  That's the dumb part about half these guys.  They hire them, but then they don't talk about what they're good at.  This is the weirdest thing, too, is like, you know, Bill Bradley comes in here, and he's  the old Nick, and then he's a senator, and he always does a show down there in the fish  bowl, and he looks like he types out the show, and he sits there and reads it. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  The other day, I'm walking by.  He's got a guest with him.  Right.  It's George Lucas.  Jesus.  George Lucas is in our lobby.  Jesus.  And I'm like, what?  What happens?  What happens?  Wow.  Huh?  Can I get 10 minutes with George Lucas?  Anything.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  And it was like, you know, as soon as you went down there, like, the booking department  was like, everyone stay away from George Lucas.  Anybody who actually does, like, a show, who just does a radio show, is like, get out of  here.  You don't belong here. 
[00:08:00]  I love when we are felt to not belong here.  Yeah.  When those really big guests come in, like, it happens with Oprah, where they shut this  place down, where the actual fellow employees of Oprah at SiriusXM are not allowed to look  at her.  We're not even allowed to look at her.  One day, and it might have been Oprah, or another big star like that, but they tried to  stop me getting off the elevator, and had to, and they said, you gotta go to 37 and walk  around.  I go, if I get back on that elevator, I'm going fucking home, dude. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So it's up to you.  Yeah.  Either get the fuck out of the way, or explain to my boss why I'm not doing a shift today.  And why was that?  Because the president was here?  Yeah, there's always somebody like that, but you know when they don't want to see us,  like, they will start glaring at Sam and E-Rock and Roland if they have food.  If they lay out food there.  We're in trouble.  You know, because fucking Chris Stanley will be down there, just fucking popping open a  beer.  And you can't go up to anybody and be like, oh, what's going on today?  Don't worry about it. 
[00:09:00]  You guys aren't going to be here, are you?  Keep moving.  It's the lobby of the building I work in.  I'm here all the time.  I know.  They treat these people that come by maybe once every two years like fucking queens and  kings.  And then we're here every day.  We can't get a fucking sandwich.  Do you remember when Gayle King interviewed Lady Gaga?  Yeah.  And it was, there was nobody was allowed in the lobby.  Yeah.  Because it, well, what are you doing here?  I just wanted to look at Lady Gaga.  Security was escorting you to the bathroom.  They would escort you to the bathroom? 
[00:09:30]  Well, they would block off the hallway with these little velvet ropes and have a security  guard there.  I'm with Ron, man.  That shit ain't happening with me.  I would just walk out of the building, say, fuck that.  I'm taking the day off.  When they did the Nirvana thing with Jon Stewart on Saturday night, they were like, Sam, Dave,  what are you guys doing here?  And we were like, we've been doing a show for two years on Saturday nights.  Did nobody realize?  Two years we've been doing this.  Get away from Jon Stewart.  Yeah.  I got yelled at because they didn't know I was in the bathroom when they let the Jonas 
[00:10:00]  brothers go in there to go to the bathroom.  What are you doing in there, Aaron?  I walked out of the bathroom.  This dude just screams at me.  What are you doing in there?  I was like, let's go to the bathroom.  What happened to having perks of the job?  No.  Those are perks where you should be able to be in the bathroom with the Jonas brothers.  You know, we could probably do a show on who's the most famous person you pissed next to.  I feel very strongly I had a Quincy Jones piss.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And I was just like, I don't know if it could get any bigger than this.  I pissed next to Ben Stiller.  All right.  That's a good one.  I mean, after we interviewed him, which makes it even worse, because a lot of times you're  pissing right next to an A-lister, but they don't know you yet.  Right.  They don't know me.  I do radio.  But when you do the interview, and then you walk, and there he is in the bathroom next  to you, it's really awkward.  Thanks, man.  It really went well.  Right.  We're both holding our dicks.  Anyway.  Doing that traffic thunder thing, huh? 
[00:11:00]  That should be great.  Yeah.  But we got Ronnie B.  The whole world was scrambling yesterday, trying to find Ronnie B.  Well, I'm also going to take full credit for this, telling you that Linsanity would be  fucking crushed.  And they got blown out last night.  Yeah.  They got manhandled.  I tweeted before the game, I said it's going to be a tough game.  They're not ready.  The Knicks are not ready.  They're not ready for that.  But when the playoffs hit, they're going to be all right.  And they will make the playoffs. 
[00:11:30]  You think they'll make the playoffs?  What, are you going to be in eighth place or something in that?  Yeah, I mean, they're five, well, I guess they're one game under 500 right now, the Knicks.  But, yeah, they're getting all their guys healthy, and they've got to figure this shit  out.  LeBron and Wade, they're too strong.  And then that Chris Bosh, who looks like everyone is set at a dyna fucking sore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you watch?  Yeah, I caught it, but then I had to switch it off because Eastside Dave was on TV last  night on a show. 
[00:12:00]  I don't understand it.  I don't know whether you know the name of it.  Wait, does he actually have a show?  No.  Oh.  He went on a show.  It's a show where they make up commercials.  Right.  And then they have comedians and stars make fun of the commercials as if it were a VH1 show.  What?  I don't get it.  So his was like some farting character, and then they all were like, I don't know what  is this, but I'm like, it's not even a real product.  It would be all right if it was a real commercial they were goofing on, no? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It would be, then it would be VH1.  Right.  But I thought of almost like when you see Stars Born and Barbara Streisand is singing that  cat commercial that this is the beginning for Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  Because visually is where he should be doing things.  Of course.  His videos are hilarious.  Yeah, they're a fucking scream.  Is this a visual?  Is it worth playing on the air?  Sam.  I haven't seen it yet.  You haven't seen it?  It's painful, but his part is fine, but he doesn't talk at all.  But the Dave part is fine, but then all the stuff that happens around it. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, I see.  But he keeps farting.  And I wrote to him last night, and he said that he's the Robert De Niro farting, which  I don't know if that's even true.  I don't know.  I don't know how you could tell who's the Robert De Niro farting.  Should we play it?  Yeah, that's all right.  Let's try it out here.  From True TV, World's Smartest Invention 6.  Chronic flatulence.  You never know when it will hit.  There you're standing in the elevator or a green screen. 
[00:13:30]  You don't like it, and neither does anyone around you.  Well, now there's a way to fight back.  Introducing Subtlebutt, the disposable gas neutralizer.  It's probably safe to say this product stinks.  Simply apply the carbon filter patch directly to your underwear.  What a weird concept.  I've just been using a brittle as a butt plug. 
[00:14:00]  They use all these weird people.  The patented technology neutralizes foul nerves.  They're like, what kind of product is this?  But it's a made-up product.  Saving your neighbor's noses.  And your reputation.  Instead of neutralizing it, why not convert it into a nice smell?  Did someone bake cinnamon buns?  I'm interested, but is there an audio component to this?  A silencer, if you will?  Get back to living your life without the sinister threat of foul odors. 
[00:14:30]  I'm hitting every taco truck in town.  Thanks, Subtlebutt.  Do I want to know what happens to these little patches when people are done with them?  No.  No, I really don't.  Take control of your backside.  Mmm.  Okay, can we get one of these sent right over to Tanya Harding's dressing room?  You know what I'm talking about, Harding!  I'll admit, my **** does stink, okay?  And so does everybody else's. 
[00:15:00]  Get Subtlebutt today.  And we have a new winner for most awkward thing to buy at the grocery store.  No, you don't, because it's not even a real product.  Wow.  It's, it's, I, I almost like the concept, because they're obviously making fun of the clip shows.  Right.  But I don't know if you know that.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Because it's a fake commercial.  But why, yeah, and it's on True TV.  Right.  Which.  I mean, Dave played his part well.  Dave farted, farted up his storm. 
[00:15:30]  A lot of scenes of Dave in public farting and doing that, and then obviously people commenting on the dumb product.  But they did have Todd Bridges and Tanya Harding.  It's hard to imagine that Tanya Harding actually ever was on skates at this point.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Well, maybe it's like a defensive man or something.  I don't know.  Holy shit.  Those girls are always, like, petite and nice and all put together well, you know?  But I guess the second she stopped skating 19 hours a day.  It all went to her hips. 
[00:16:00]  Hips don't lie.  But the rest of them have stayed in shape.  You see Dorothy Hamill.  I think they still skate, though.  Yeah.  They never stop skating.  Yeah, they go out and skate, and for whatever reason, those things still.  And Harding just said a lot of money.  Harding said, fuck that.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know whether she could, like, be in Disney on ice or whatever those fucking shows.  Nobody would ever see her again.  No.  No, she didn't get hired for any of those.  So you panicked yesterday, Ronnie, with your text message. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah, I did.  Because I guess getting back to the thing, like, everyone's gone.  I mean, everyone.  Yeah.  And we had Ronnie on yesterday.  I feel like I'm pushing it, having you two days in a row.  Well, I was supposed to do it today.  Yeah.  And then they said do it Thursday.  Because I thought I had someone for today.  Yeah.  So I was kind of fooling around with the schedule.  So I had coverage.  And then it turned out everyone, like, is gone today.  So I was writing you like crazy, basically begging you. 
[00:17:00]  And then it turns out that Roland was writing you.  Roland was writing.  And that had, like, my guy's freaking out there, like, Roland's freaking out.  Yeah.  And I was just sleeping.  And, like, that crazy, I don't do morning radio anymore sleep.  Right.  Like, almost like someone shot me with a trank dart.  Really?  That's how hard I slept.  Yeah.  Nice and deep.  Yeah.  It's a weird concept to get up this early.  It's fucking awful.  And then start talking and trying to be entertaining less than an hour after you woke up. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  So.  It's always, like, funny.  It's like if there's a rock and roll guy on the Today Show.  Right.  That they just sit around and start bitching.  Yeah.  About how early it is.  Yeah.  And Matt has to say, dude, I'm up this early every day.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Yeah.  I'm kind of used to it by now.  But you haven't done mornings in so long you forgot.  You forgot.  I honestly believe in sleeping until you wake up on your own.  Right.  Like, that is the way a person should live their life.  No alarm clock.  You never should have an alarm clock.  There should never be anyone.  And even, like, any kind of a nice, like, honey, wake up. 
[00:18:00]  That's still annoying as shit to me.  Sure.  Sure.  It just feels like the worst interruption.  It makes sense.  I write, you want it tomorrow.  We'd love to have you.  And I didn't hear from you.  And then a text comes in at 830.  I just want to get in your head for a second.  You just write, sorry, dude, just woke up.  Looks like I missed you.  Like you were panicking or something.  No, I didn't know where the fuck I was.  You didn't know where you were? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Did you assume you missed Friday's show at that point?  Well, I had done that, and I think I had written back to Roland and didn't hear from him.  Right.  I was just in that fucking strange place of, like, what the fuck?  Well, Roland just doesn't read his text messages or something.  Because then I'm trying to tell him that I got you.  And he's like, I emailed Ron and Mark Zito, emailed me back, waiting to hear back from Ron. 
[00:19:00]  Jim Lenz at JFK 545.  And I just interrupt him.  I'm like, read your text.  I said I got Ron coming in at 6.  So now we move forward from there.  But then you wrote, you're going to be the Calvary today.  I was going to be the comedy Calvary.  Yeah, I'll be there like funny Calvary.  Oh, yeah.  So thank you.  But I also got a text from Caroline's asking me to be part of Talkin' Walkin', which I cannot do. 
[00:19:30]  Well, me and Ronnie were talking.  It has nothing to do with Kevin Pollak.  We just don't know how we could do Talkin' Walkin', which is Kevin Pollak's new concept.  Where he sits there and does an amazing Christopher Walkin' impression, talks about some of the goofy stories of the day, and then we're supposed to work off that.  But how the impression goes, you don't, I was telling Ron, you don't know when to fucking jump in.  Right.  When you're talking to either the real Christopher Walkin', or like Jay Moore doing Christopher Walkin', or Kevin Pollak doing Christopher Walkin', or the British Asian Christopher Walkin'. 
[00:20:00]  How do you get in there?  You can't do it.  So then you look like the idiot.  Yeah, you are.  Well, I think you're set up to be the idiot.  Oh, really?  I think that's the point.  He's going to talk crazy, and then you're going to try to be a normal person, and everyone laughs.  Like, look how awkward.  It's like if you just fucking ran into a candid camera on purpose.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  So we're avoiding Talkin' Walkin'.  Yeah, I can't do it, because I'm out of town this weekend.  Well, because I said I just can't do it.  You got to do it, dude.  So then they focused on you. 
[00:20:30]  They're like, well, you're not doing anything.  Yeah.  I got an Oscars thing.  I'm tweeting Oscars shit for a website.  What website?  I don't know.  I got all the info.  I got to tweet it later.  But it's a bunch of us.  Me, Aunt Jimmy, Bob Kelly, a few others.  So you're not doing your own tweet?  I am.  But I guess I got to hashtag their website or something.  Oh, okay.  I see now.  It'll be on a website.  It'll be just scrolling on their website.  It's a pretty good concept.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Instead of just tweeting it on my own, it just goes out to wherever the fuck. 
[00:21:00]  At least this is focused a little bit.  And then people get mad at you for tweeting too much?  Like, enough tweets!  Well, I warn them, though.  I save my tweets leading up to the big live tweeting events.  Oh, I see.  I save them.  And I tell everyone, look, I'm not tweeting a lot right now because I'm going to kill you  on Sunday.  Sam, are you a tweeter doing big events like that?  Yeah, I love tweeting big events.  Sam does pretty good.  Yeah.  Sam's a pretty good live tweeter.  Any award show, anything that a lot of people are watching. 
[00:21:30]  I try not to do wrestling shows because people just get pissed off.  Right.  Those big mainstream pop culture events like that.  Big mainstream pop culture, especially like an MTV award show or something young like  that.  Uh-huh.  Big into it.  I'm not on Twitter, but I will go over there and like punch in SNL during the musical act  to see everyone get pissed off every fucking week.  Yeah.  A million people hate the fucking musical act.  And you've got to be thinking to yourself, like, somebody's thinking like, oh shit, we're 
[00:22:00]  getting SNL.  This is great.  This could be it for us.  Right.  Yeah.  And they just lay and fucking hate.  That's the problem with the internet is it's filled with awful people.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's why Twitter needs you, Ronnie.  Twitter needs you.  I just, you know, I eye bang it.  That's it.  That's the future, I think.  I think just like Twitter replaced.  And terror bang?  Yeah.  Hey!  I practiced last night.  Very good.  Terror bang.  Very good.  The eye bang on Twitter, though, which I think is very important. 
[00:22:30]  You can get to the eye bang, too, just by doing that.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, Pollock actually knew the name before you did.  Well, he's a big fan of the show.  I had no idea.  Did you?  Did you know he was fucking like a kid?  I think he actually is a real fan of the shows.  Some people just say that, and then you're like, oh, yeah?  Well, what do you like about the show?  They never come up with it.  Oh, yeah.  I have.  They're right to their face.  Oh, yeah.  I was live tweeting the Knicks game last night, matter of fact.  Were you really?  Yeah.  Lynn was a bust, but I think he's fucking tired, too, man.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  It's a crazy schedule this year.  He's had the craziest two weeks of anyone.  But just look at...  Because, I mean, besides playing, like, the NBA schedule this year is crazy because they  had the lockout, so they're playing a lot more games.  You know what I mean?  They're not resting as much.  And then on top of that, he's doing a shitload of interviews.  He's trying to find a place to live.  He's signing shoe deals.  All this crap is going on in the last two weeks, and I think he finally just had it  last night and is tired. 
[00:23:30]  He had a really bad game.  But he's playing an incredibly good...  I mean, these fucking teams will have a fast break with one guy.  Right.  One guy with a fast break by himself.  Right.  It's the craziest...  The speed on that team is phenomenal in the Heat this year.  Yeah.  No, the Heat are...  I don't see anybody stopping them.  They're unstoppable, to be honest with you.  We'll see.  I just don't want LeBron to get that championship.  Why?  You got a hate for LeBron?  Yeah.  Just how he left Cleveland.  He had every right to leave Cleveland.  It was just the way he fucking did it. 
[00:24:00]  Poor Cleveland.  Kind of clueless how...  It was kind of...  He was kind of clueless, I think, how much, like, you know, Cleveland cared about him.  Right.  That's what bothered me.  It's like, you grew up in this area.  You know how important you were to the whole city.  And just how he left, I feel like he didn't understand that at all.  Well, I think that, you know, when you get that much money when you're 18...  Right.  ...you don't know how the rest of the world works.  Right.  You know, and you just start to say to, like, the lady at the 7-Eleven, why don't you take 
[00:24:30]  your private jet to the fucking games?  Like, you don't realize there's nothing that has exposed him.  His first job...  Yeah.  ...was the NBA.  Right.  ...as a multi-millionaire.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  He's just like a fucking...  Like, the people around him should have slowed his shit down.  That's what I'm thinking.  I mean, when you get to that level, you gotta assume you got some really good people around  you.  You know?  I...  I...  I mean, he...  I just feel like he was just...  Had no fucking clue. 
[00:25:00]  And it made him look really bad.  Of course he...  He had the right to leave Cleveland and sign somewhere else.  Of course.  I wish he was a Knick.  And if he left Cleveland that way, I would be a huge fan of LeBron James if he was a  Knick.  Yeah.  I know.  And everyone thought he was coming.  Robert Randolph, the guitar player, was in here right before and he was like, trust  me, man.  It's happening.  He goes, I can't tell you this on the air, but I'm friends with the owner of the Knicks.  I fucking go to all the games and he's gonna be there and it's gonna be fucking great.  Right.  And he's gonna own this down. 
[00:25:30]  And I'm like, all right, it's happening.  Fucking three hours later, he's in Miami.  And they're like, I feel like the people of Cleveland.  Right.  You know, because I just wanted to see giant signs of him wherever I went around town.  Yeah.  He fucked up, though, because he really would have owned New York because it's a basketball  town, really.  Of course it is.  More than Miami.  I mean, they're making Miami a basketball town, yes.  You know, because I don't feel like dealing with people today, but you're right.  The Knicks, Madison Square Garden, this is a basketball city, man. 
[00:26:00]  It is.  Big fucking time.  And, you know, people, like, in the city itself, I don't even think they cared about  the giant Super Bowl.  Like, the suburban people do.  Right.  But people in the city, it's Yankees and the Knicks have been so dormant that they, you  know, forgot about it.  Right.  But now everyone's all in again.  And the Rangers, of course.  But see, like, last night, proving that Miami's still not really a basketball town, you got  you got Linsanity going down to fucking Miami, right?  The game starts.  Did you watch from the beginning a little bit? 
[00:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  There were so many empty seats.  Everybody in Miami shows up late.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's the type of fucking sports town that is.  They're saying at Madison Square Garden, usually people stroll in a little late, right?  But because of Linsanity, people are like, fuck that, they're getting to their seats like  a half hour early just to watch them warm up.  And you would assume they would have wanted to do that down in Miami, but they're like,  nah, man, I could get an extra half hour of sun or whatever.  Yeah, everybody's doing rails in the parking lot.  I was down there in 97 when the Marlins won, and they would put, like, 1,800 people in that 
[00:27:00]  entire fucking thing while these guys are on a pennant run.  Right.  And you could hear, like, you could be sitting behind first base, and you hear someone talking,  and you look out, and they were sitting in the right field stands.  Wow.  You just hear this echo of people going, I don't know, maybe we'll go get some food after  the game.  Wow.  It was the weirdest experience ever.  That's sad.  And even the Dolphins didn't draw this year.  No.  Dolphins need a really good team for people to actually, you know, go to those games. 
[00:27:30]  If they have a mediocre team, they're not showing up.  Yeah, that's true.  So, nah, we'll see what happens.  All-Star break, and the Knicks will get it together.  That's another thing.  Why is the All-Star game going up against the Oscars?  I don't know.  Isn't that weird?  Isn't that fucking insane?  That's stupid.  Or is it during the day?  No, it's going to be a night game.  I'm pretty sure.  I think it's 7, 8 o'clock at night.  They couldn't figure that out?  And make it Saturday night?  Well, Saturday night is their skills competition.  Well, then they could have made that Friday night. 
[00:28:00]  Everybody goes crazy for that, to see someone.  And they were supposed to do a thing where they dunked over a couch, and Lynn was going  to be fucking laying on the couch.  Is that?  Yeah.  That was his role?  Yeah, and then this guy fucking hurt his knee or whatever.  Right.  Everyone's really pissed about it, because they went to see him lay on a couch and have  someone dunked over him.  Those are the fun...  That's the funniest shit ever.  Right.  Because what happens is, there will always be these rap stars that are fucking sitting  around, and when someone really dunks, they'll get up and start running like they can't fucking 
[00:28:30]  believe.  Like, oh shit!  Oh shit!  While they're fucking shooting it on video.  Right.  Shooting it on video horribly.  Yeah, sure.  Exactly.  Whenever you see those guys, it used to be the flips, and now they're just popping up  their iPhones after the Super Bowl or whatever.  If you really focus in on what they're shooting, they're just shooting nothing.  They're just holding the camera up, and it's moving from side to side.  But they will...  Here's the fucking funny thing about these urban kids now, is they will videotape their 
[00:29:00]  own assaults, robberies.  They don't give a shit.  We have a thing up on the iBank today where a guy goes nuts because he didn't get $2 back  at the burger place.  Oh really?  He loses his shit.  Yeah.  Can we see that?  He's almost like the...  I like to call it Interrobang myself.  Okay, it's theinterrobang.com or the iBang on Twitter.  Yeah.  Or you can just go to the iBang.  Yeah.  But some young brother, he's hanging out, it's just called I Want My $2, based upon, 
[00:29:30]  of course, Better Off Dead.  That's where that comes from.  But he doesn't get his $2, and he just starts losing his shit.  Why isn't he getting his $2 back?  Uh, I don't know, he's supposed to get like a couple of bucks off with a coupon or whatever.  Oh shit.  And he just fucking, he gets so fucking angry.  What is she doing?  Is she drunk again?  Yeah.  Come in.  Yeah.  She likes talking about how she takes loads on the face and stuff.  She was here at 5.30 in the morning. 
[00:30:00]  Are you drunk again?  No, we don't need to talk about it.  I'm just letting you know.  I'm a little drunk.  We don't have to talk, you just put up a note in the middle of our discussion.  It was a distraction.  What's going on?  I'm sorry, I just wanted to let you know, you know, hungover again.  Oh, you are hungover?  Dying.  She doesn't want to get married, Ron.  I think that's what it is.  I've been drinking so heavily lately that, I mean...  What time did you drink till?  Um, about two.  Mm.  Yeah.  I never took you as a drinker. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, I like to drink.  It's the pressure of the marriage.  I don't like to drink to the exes that I have been.  You're starting to realize you're making a horrible decision.  I'm not making a mistake.  You sure?  I hope not.  Dude, her show doesn't start till 7 o'clock.  Yeah, why are you here?  She plays hits.  Are you in trouble?  She gets here at 7.  She was here at 5.25.  Because I had...  I have wedding things to do, so I need to get as much done as I can.  What are you doing for the wedding?  What do you mean, what am I doing?  You said wedding.  It's a big wedding.  Yeah, it's a big wedding.  It's gotten out of control.  How many people? 
[00:31:00]  200.  That's big.  And you don't even want to do it.  No.  I hate my mom.  I hate my dad.  I hate everybody coming.  I hate money.  I should have just eloped.  I mean...  Why you hate all those people?  Because it's like...  Why?  I don't even know you.  I don't know you...  You don't know your mom and dad?  No, I'm just saying, I don't know cousins Cindy.  You said you hate your mom and dad.  Well, they're just frustrating.  Planning a wedding, it's just exhausting.  You've got to deal with everyone's issues.  Did you have a big wedding?  Yeah.  Sorry to invite you.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  I didn't really know you then.  All right.  Carry on.  I don't think she could be with one person either.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  She's more of a party person.  Yeah, we all see it.  You understand.  Yeah, we all see it.  She's like, come in here.  Oh, I had a sex dream about you last night.  By the way, I'm getting married.  Why are you missing your shoes?  Because they're stopping wet.  Booze.  Because they're stopping wet.  Because I wore ballet flats because I didn't know it was raining.  So I'm letting them dry.  How do you not know it's raining today?  I was drinking.  But you were out drinking when the rain started. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I didn't check the weather.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It's becoming a problem for her, though.  It worked.  Yeah, she doesn't.  I mean, this doesn't happen to people that aren't alcoholics.  There isn't.  People that aren't alcoholics don't act like I don't know what my shoes are.  Right.  She was in here drunk before her show last week.  That was last week.  She has nothing going on between those ears, huh?  Nothing.  She's fucking filling it up with tequila.  Yeah, she's got nothing happening.  That is the thing.  She's really good looking, but...  She's a bimbo in every sense of the word. 
[00:32:30]  She is a bimbo, right?  Yes.  I was trying to be careful with this.  She's a fucking runaway train, too.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, this poor guy that's marrying her.  If she's like this now, you know what I mean?  Like, she hates everything now.  Yeah.  Because the woman is at least supposed to be the one that likes getting married.  Because I don't think a guy dreams of a big wedding.  I don't think growing up we dream of...  You're right.  That's a girl's fantasy.  Right.  You know, I like being married.  I'm not going to lie.  Right.  And I really do.  But the wedding itself.  No, that's the... 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I think girls are trained from a very early age, you know, about their big wedding  day.  I'm having almost nothing to do with the planning of my wedding.  And that's the way it should be.  Right.  Because anytime Jess asks me anything, I'm just getting angry.  But see, the thing is...  You're supposed to just show up.  Yeah.  By doing that, it means that you're a good person.  Like, getting involved is what would make you the bad husband.  Right.  Just like, I want to do whatever you want to do.  Go for it.  Make your dreams come true.  But Ronnie's right.  It's always been a girl's thing.  Yeah, definitely. 
[00:33:30]  You hear it.  I mean, I got a niece in there already.  She's 12.  Yeah.  And it comes up here and there.  Oh, someday you'll be...  It's almost like, for a guy, it's like death.  Like, you know it'll happen to you, but you won't let yourself think about it.  Right.  You're like, yeah, I guess.  One day I'll be married.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to lie to you.  I think it's going to happen.  But I'm not going to think about that.  It's not out there.  I can't do it.  There's nothing I could do about it.  All I can do is move on.  Why does she leave?  I want to talk to her some more.  She's got to play the hits.  She doesn't come on. 
[00:34:00]  She's got 10 more minutes until she comes on.  That's the first hour of pre-taped.  She's got 10 minutes before a show where she doesn't have to do anything.  Want me to go grab her?  What else can we ask her?  I don't know.  We might have got everything we can out of her.  She's not going to remain faithful to that husband or hers either.  You honestly don't think she's a play around girl?  She loves to have a good time.  She loves to have, you know, she loves attention.  She walked by with a sign saying she was hungover.  She loves male attention. 
[00:34:30]  Now, like, if you found out your chick at work was like, walk around with no shoes on.  Oh, God.  I'm really drunk.  Oh, my God.  You'd be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  This guy is going to lose all his hair and have a nervous breakdown.  And she's not going to Cosmo Radio and talking to girls about this stuff.  It's male attention that she wants.  Yes, because she's like, I'm not a girl's girl.  I'm not comfortable around them.  I like football and doing shots and blowing people.  She loves telling me that she has sex dreams about me. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  She's told you that two different times.  That's not good for either one of you.  Huh?  That's not good for either one of you because that starts to fucking drip.  It's like the Grand Canyon.  It just drips and drips and drips until something happens.  Well, Jimmy Schitzel writes from Pennsylvania.  Come on, Ope.  She's dog shit ugly.  She's not fucking ugly.  She's not ugly at all, man.  She's a bimbo, but she's not ugly.  The bimbowness makes her ugly in my world.  You think so?  I need a little fucking smart.  Something to...  A little bit. 
[00:35:30]  You got to talk at some point.  A little bit.  Even if it was just like a quick thing?  No, then I don't give a fuck.  Then you don't care, right?  But I mean, if you're going to have a relationship with someone, I need, you know, less bimbo.  All due respect to...  Always needed less bimbo.  All due respect to her husband-to-be, but she's not really the girl that you marry, is she?  No.  No, she's not.  You don't fucking marry someone who's wearing a Jaeger shirt.  Exactly.  You're just, you know, asking for fucking trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's running around with no shoes. 
[00:36:00]  Five o'clock in the morning.  She can't even figure out that it's going to be a rainy day.  That bothers me.  That's like basic knowledge.  She was out drinking last night.  Because every day is Mardi Gras in her fucking world.  Right, right.  She'll fucking show her tits for beads.  Doesn't it?  Oh, no, that's not him.  I thought that was the guy she does the show with.  Oh.  They all look alike, though, man.  They do.  Yeah, they do.  There's a look.  Fixing their hair before they go on the radio.  Fucking mod squad.  But, I mean, I don't follow the weather.  It's just, you just know. 
[00:36:30]  Especially if you're out drinking while it's raining.  It's just kind of a sense you have.  I don't need to look up weather ever.  I knew it was going to be a rainy day.  We have windows.  Yeah, it's just dumb shit like that.  And if you're wearing ballet shoes and you're not doing ballet that day,  you're wearing the wrong fucking shoes.  In February.  Right.  Yeah.  Dude, that's the other weird thing.  This hasn't even been a winter, has it?  No.  This is fucking almost freaky.  Are you, uh...  Thinking 2012 and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  It's over.  It's over.  I don't know if it's going to hit 2012, but...  I feel bad.  We're on the downside of it.  Oh, yeah.  I feel bad for the kids.  That's who I feel bad for.  I've had enough experiences.  I feel bad for the little ones.  Yeah.  They have no idea.  No, they're going to be living like it's the road.  Is it global warming, you think?  I don't know what it is.  It's that.  It's a fucking alien invasion.  There's something happening.  An alien invasion would be great.  That would bring, you know, the whole world together, finally.  Yeah, but we'd get our ass kicked.  You think?  By anybody who could get there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, good point. 
[00:37:30]  We would stand a fucking chance against them.  Good point.  If you could get to Earth, oh boy.  Our technology tells us that there's nothing out there that exists.  And they're laughing at that.  And they're getting here, so...  They're getting here from some place that we don't even know about.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're laughing at us like, fucking idiots.  They think there's nothing out here.  We would be worse off than the Indians were when they looked out and saw sails.  Right.  You know?  That day, they were fucked.  Yeah.  They never stood a chance.  Wow.  It would be the same thing. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Maybe they're...  And what did they do?  Oh, great.  So glad you guys are here.  Mm-hmm.  Dummies.  Yeah.  Would we welcome aliens?  Sure.  We would wrap the smallpox blankets around ourselves.  We would have to welcome aliens.  That would be our only chance.  But they did the Twilight Zone episode.  What?  Everybody welcomed the alien because he said...  But we have to.  He was there to help everybody.  And then they found out his book was a cookbook.  And he was taking people back to his planet to eat them.  Dude, I've got that fucking Netflix right now.  What?  I'm sorry.  It's a cookbook! 
[00:38:30]  To serve man.  No, it's to serve man.  Could we...  See the wordplay?  Could we get Nicole back?  I want to know the...  You've got a thing for this girl.  I want to know, like, the most intelligent thing she knows.  Okay.  Dude, I'm just...  What do you think it would be?  This is a...  I want her to blow...  You're playing with fire, dude.  How about we...  I want her to blow our minds with some knowledge she's got.  Oh, I'm so glad you said our minds.  I was so fucking nervous now.  She's a mess.  You see her all the time around here? 
[00:39:00]  She's ramped up in the last few weeks.  Yeah.  She so doesn't want to get married.  Like, one time she brought in some photos of her in college, or near college, wherever  she was doing, but she would just dress in, like, denim overalls and hippie tie-dyed  shirts, just constantly smoking pot the entire time.  Well, I think she's a nudist, too.  She told us that.  I think growing up, she walked around her house naked with her parents and stuff.  I think.  Then had a threesome with her boyfriend on the beach.  That she's now married?  She got some guy watched. 
[00:39:30]  Well, who was the third person, though?  Some other...  Some girlfriend of hers.  Is it the guy she's marrying?  No, I don't think it's the guy she's marrying.  It was a boyfriend before that.  But she came in.  I think it was on the after show.  She came in and talked about it.  She had a threesome on a beach one morning.  It was like four or five in the morning.  And then when they finished, there was some guy that was applauding because he was watching  the whole thing.  Jesus.  What beach?  Walwood?  What do you got, Sam?  She said she can't come in because in four minutes, she's got to be ready to do the 4-1-1. 
[00:40:00]  What's the 4-1-1?  She just reads TMZ.  She does the Hollywood gossip.  It's hard for you to hear the 4-1-1 this morning.  But she said...  I said they want to know the most intelligent thing you know.  And after debating it for a while, she said she knows a lot about food.  Oh, boy.  Like where to buy it.  Yeah.  Ronnie was asking me if she's around a lot.  And I said, not really.  She usually just kind of walks by.  We barely talk to her, but she's ramped it up lately. 
[00:40:30]  Coming in drunk and hungover and shit.  She was in here last week completely fucked up.  Yeah.  Right after Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day.  So a couple weeks ago.  We should fucking get it off this pool how long this thing's going to last.  Because I put it under a year.  You know, most people give it a try and shit like that, but...  You say under a year.  Yeah.  Wow.  I just had a friend like about two years ago that was saying, I don't know if I should  be getting married.  And I go, you won't stay married. 
[00:41:00]  Like I used to before just act like that's between them.  But I've been to enough weddings now and I could fucking lock in and bet on it.  Bet on it.  First of all, when you're young, you stand less of a chance.  And I hate being invited to someone's wedding who's like 24.  It's just like fucking wasted money.  What a waste of a night.  And then beyond that, if anyone has even the slightest inkling that they can't do it.  I mean, could you imagine like... 
[00:41:30]  It's a long road.  Yeah.  You got to be all in in the beginning.  It's like if you're a boxer, you're like, I'm not sure I want to do this.  You got to really want to fucking fight.  Of course.  You know, you've got...  It's all about confidence at this level.  She knows she doesn't want to get married.  Yeah, I know.  But something...  What is making her get married?  I guess because he makes money.  You know, he's been...  They've been together for like three years.  That's what happens.  Like now what are we supposed to do?  He's a little older than she is.  What kind of money is he making?  He works in finance and stuff. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  He's making nice money.  Yeah, until the fucking FBI comes and starts fucking taking her computers and shit.  You think she'll stay with him now?  No.  Fuck no.  No one does.  They all act like I'm with a crook.  That guy takes the fall alone.  Yeah.  You know, because the whole family's got to know, hey, we're spending fucking money like  we're...  Like dad is a Colombian Coke dealer.  That's the weirdest thing.  Like when you don't earn the money, you just spend the shit out of it. 
[00:42:30]  It's almost like a guilt thing.  You don't bother adding anything up.  No math.  No figuring out like, is this salary meant...  No.  Okay, it's there.  I might as well spend it.  Yeah.  But you just throw everything out.  As soon as you get handed a big thing of cash, you're just spending it right away.  Because that's no...  You're pushing it forward.  Yeah.  Let's get back to the interbang.  So this is the $2 guy.  Yeah, this is the $2 guy.  Losing his shit because he didn't get his $2 back.  I'm going to go like a minute or so into this, but he is fucking great.  Go ahead.  Fast food.  What are we looking at?  McDonald's? 
[00:43:00]  It's like a McDonald's.  And...  And he's a grown man.  Yes.  And he's just yelling at women.  Over $2.  Over $2.  They're not ripping them off.  There's just a misunderstanding.  It seems to be somewhat of a buyer beware situation. 
[00:43:30]  But again, somebody's just standing behind him and they're like, you can see it's a fucking  iPhone thing.  Like, I've got to fucking shoot this.  I don't want to talk.  I'll give you my motherfuckers.  With another video.  Once you start yelling like that at people, it's never going to get back together again.  It's over. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Now, what would you be doing, like, if you were in the place?  You've got to take a look at that.  Oh, of course.  You've got to save yourself.  Some shit's going to go down.  Would you just give them the $2 at that point if you're working the counter, though?  Yes.  I always would.  It would suck losing your life over two stupid dollars.  Right.  He actually just yelled, I had a premonition. 
[00:44:30]  No, he didn't.  Now it's swinging.  There goes the camera.  What?  We've got to explain. 
[00:45:00]  He took the whole cash register and pulled it off its body.  Slammed it.  And body slammed it over $2?  But she was.  And now she's pissed because that's her register.  Right.  But the funny thing is, that's when he didn't have an opening anymore.  Like, she said, this is never happening.  You're not getting no money without no receipt.  Now, believe it or not, it actually gets better.  How does it get better than the guy fucking slamming the register down?  There's a register.  Over two bucks.  Yeah.  There's a register now slammed into the floor. 
[00:45:30]  Okay.  That is a new trend in videos.  You're right.  Rodney's absolutely right.  You have to now turn the camera to yourself to comment.  This shit is crazy.  This shit is crazy.  Because he's thinking, I'm going to go viral.  Right.  I am finally fucking going viral.  Right.  I got to add that move to my video. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, you got to.  This shit is crazy.  And this is what you do in the summer, right?  You just walk around to New York till you see shit like this.  I love it.  Well, I mean, you walk around for two hours in New York City, you're going to see some  shit.  Right.  Every fucking day.  I just haven't done it lately.  I've been busy with the kid and all.  Well, it's too cold and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But in summer, like that chain thing that you had last year was like, I probably watched  that 20 times.  Yeah.  I just sat there going, would I have been going by? 
[00:46:30]  And then I'm thinking, no, I walk by those people all the time.  There's no reason to go back and try to straighting a nut.  Ronnie's talking.  It was the day that Obama was in town, too.  And Obama was a mere two weeks, two blocks away from this guy who had just a massive,  thick chain.  How long was the chain?  Like six feet?  Oh, no, yeah.  It was a big, and it was like about three or four pounds.  And I got on the scene when he was having an altercation with another guy.  And the other guy was, you know, being all tough. 
[00:47:00]  But in the end, he backed down because this guy was insanely crazy.  But the important part of the video, and you live in New York, so Ronnie certainly will  relate to this, is the fact, like you just said, you see it in the video, people are just  walking by.  Right.  They're not even, like, when I see this shit, I stop.  I'm like, holy fuck, this is better than a movie.  And most people won't even give it a glance.  They just walk through these scenes.  And a lot of them don't even realize it's happening.  Right.  That's what's scary.  Because a lot of people have just turned themselves off to the city. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to get here.  I'm not going to fucking deal with anything.  Right.  That the city is trying to slow me down with.  Right.  And that's like a survivor's move.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Your thing that you do, you're taking, like, a documentary attitude to it.  But sooner or later, you could be the guy who catches a bullet.  You know what I mean?  Because sooner or later, one of these guys is just going to start fucking shooting.  I always try to protect myself.  I always try to, like, see where I'm at and stuff, to be honest with you.  But these people will walk by, and I'm like, do you realize there's a guy with a six-foot 
[00:48:00]  chain literally two feet from you as you're just crossing the road?  You don't even see this?  That's what I find way more amazing than the action, by the way.  And just regular people.  It's not like these are fucking gangsters walking by.  No.  Hit that.  I'm glad you like this one.  No, it's fucking hysterical and really fucking strangely scary.  And he's got to be 60.  Yeah.  Stop me down now, nigga.  Here I am.  Stop me down now, nigga.  Stop me down now, nigga.  Stop me down now, nigga. 
[00:48:30]  Sit up.  Sit the fuck up.  Look at that guy.  He doesn't even notice that this guy's screaming.  And why is he wearing the orange safety vest?  Works for the city, I think.  Unless that's his homeless life.  Why are you walking back, dude?  You don't want any part of that.  Yeah, the guy's now going to go pick up his six-foot chain.  It's more of a visual, obviously.  Maybe I'll retweet this today so you can check it out.  Look at these people just walking. 
[00:49:00]  They don't even notice.  The sound's been laden.  The sound's been laden, he's yelling.  You can take the chain, yo.  What you talking about, nigga?  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Yeah, that's more of a visual, but it gives you a nice feel of what New Yorkers don't see.  He's got an elderly Special Delivery Jones fucking feel about him.  This guy can fucking handle himself.  No doubt.  All right, Sam, go back to where the guy's...  All right, where were we at with this video?  He's just body slammed, just lost his shit and body slammed. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  And as you move along with it, he'll get angrier and angrier.  It goes on for a while, but go ahead and play a little bit of it.  Excuse me, I should never lie.  Okay.  Okay.  Bro, you ain't gonna get nothing back if you can flip them down the seat after they're playing, bro.  You ain't gonna get nothing back.  Don't you think I'm lying?  I'm gonna get a bad man.  See, the other thing with these black women...  Look, he just kicked it on the floor. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, he's gone.  Yeah.  That's it?  Watch him as he heads down the street, though.  Oh, really?  They followed?  Yeah.  Look at him hobbling.  He broke his fucking toe.  What you see is him walking by the window.  He left the store, and he's hobbling because he just kicked the rest of him so hard.  He probably broke a few toes.  You can see the whole video on Interrobang, man. 
[00:50:30]  Is there more worth watching here?  No, no.  That's the whole best part of it.  Okay.  Now, the beauty of that, too, is black women will not compromise.  They're not...  I don't know whether they should be in the service industry.  Yeah.  Because they're just saying to the guy, I don't give a fuck.  It ain't there.  You ain't getting shit.  Yeah.  There's no manager.  Hey, let's talk this over.  Unbelievable. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I'm handing over the two bucks.  Why would you argue with a guy?  Just give him his two dumb dollars.  Do you ever work in a situation like that?  Not really.  I worked in a video store.  I worked in a hotel, like, an overnight as an auditor.  Yeah.  And one night, a guy fucking came into the place and pointed his shotgun at me.  And he started screaming.  And I'm like a kid.  I'm like 19 at the time.  Yeah.  And he started screaming, like, I'm tired of people, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:51:30]  And I'm like this.  Dude, I understand exactly what you're saying.  Let's get this money into your fucking pocket.  And let's get you out on heels.  I don't want your money.  I want your respect.  I'm like, couldn't respect you anymore.  Loving what you're doing right now.  Because I feel like you're speaking for all of us.  I just started fucking wrapping my ass off.  Holy shit.  And this guy just came in.  I don't know what happened before or since.  Right.  And he fucking literally walked out the fucking door, you know, still just pointing the gun  around. 
[00:52:00]  A little while later, a fucking cop came in and said, hey, did you like a, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I saw him.  Whatever, you know, it is.  I ain't going to a lineup.  But, yeah, you're looking for somebody.  Wow.  Was he lit up?  No, man.  He was just like, I guess he was like a crazy person.  But he was simply fucking at the edge of whatever could fucking happen to you as a human.  Did you have a, did you believe you were going to die that day?  You know what?  It's, I don't know why you've been around fucking guns at all.  Hell fucking no.  But you just really fucking, it kind of takes you to a fucking warm fucking place of, 
[00:52:30]  I'm going to get out of this.  You know what I mean?  Really?  You know what I mean?  Like.  You got to use all your skills.  Yeah.  In your, you know, like I, when people talk about street smarts and shit, a lot of people  think, oh, you got to fight everybody.  I think you got to do whatever it takes, you know, to get out of things.  And I kind of fucking picked up from being a kid with a lot of that.  But I was like right away, like it's me and you, dude, against this whole fucking planet.  Right.  And I fucking so glad that you're fucking. 
[00:53:00]  Did you ask him, do you have another shotgun?  Because I'm joining you.  I would.  It's me and you.  I would have left with him.  Let's go.  Let's do this.  Mickey and Mallory the whole thing.  Yeah.  But like I saw like this guy was fucking wired.  In the middle of the night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Did they get him?  You know what?  I never even fucking followed up on it.  You know, it was like a really bad place.  It was like a fucking racetrack was there.  You know, so we would do all these fucking track ruts.  Philly?  It was outside.  It was like closer to Wilmington, Delaware.  Okay.  Um, but the weird thing about it was I was running so many fucking scams at that place. 
[00:53:30]  I was probably making more money there than I am now.  Nice.  I was selling fucking rooms that were already like fucked up to college students like for  an hour or two.  So I also, since I was the audit, I always took and rang up two rooms in between the shifts  and that was my money.  So I would leave with all this fucking cash.  There was some girls working that I would fucking aim people towards, you know, like,  yeah, I do know the girls, but let me think. 
[00:54:00]  Let me think.  And guys would fucking take me.  You know, I had so many fucking scams going there.  I'm like, I, I could, I hope I never leave here.  Right.  I hope this is my career.  You're doing well.  Yeah.  Did you ever get caught?  No, there was the whole fucking place was so sideways.  You know what I mean?  Right.  There was so like, the only reason that you would go in there is that you were a degenerate  gambler or you were having a fucking drug deal.  Right.  Going down.  So you understood.  Yeah.  I mean, I, when these people were walking through the door, they could fucking count on me to just 
[00:54:30]  say, I'm, you know, just let's all do whatever the fuck you want to do, but let's keep this.  Were you dealing a little bit too?  Yeah.  Everybody said, you know what I mean?  I was trying to help out everybody.  I wanted to make sure everybody could party.  I know why I like you.  You're, you're a lot like Brother Weez, man.  Brother Weez was doing all this shit too.  Just working it on the streets.  Brother Weez and you are very similar as far as your street smarts and very intelligent,  very intelligent people too.  It is.  Weez was working like numbers and drugs and, and, uh, women. 
[00:55:00]  It's a very exciting fucking life for a young kid.  And then he, and then he, and then he just, he, he stumbled into radio one day, which is  another scam.  It's just another fucking angle.  It really is.  As much as I bitch, I go home and go, I get paid.  What?  For this?  Yeah.  For what I did today?  At the, you know, like you're even saying today, like, like, Oh dude, thanks so much for  doing this.  Yes.  For the first time in like fucking a year, I'm going to work a full shift. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Of what a normal human being would be.  Right.  Right.  I know.  Yeah.  Two, eight hours officially.  And any other job, Oh, this would be considered the break.  Right.  What you and I are doing.  Yeah.  Well, I know in the break room, just shooting the shit.  You're right.  No hard labor here.  I own a fucking, um, uh, why is Jeffrey's pissed?  He's got a story.  Why?  I don't want to, uh, you made a good story.  Yeah.  I think it's funny.  He's, what does he get at you?  He's pissed at somebody else, not associated with the show. 
[00:56:00]  Is he mad at a cabbie?  No, but I don't want to reveal his story.  Why are you so fucking vague all the time?  To tease.  He'll tell a story when he gets, I'm not vague.  Why can't you just fucking tell OB?  Yeah, we don't need none of my guys.  We don't need to tease the audience, not the fucking host, Sam.  Yeah, we don't, we don't, we don't need a tease shit anymore.  We got them.  We got these people.  Well, they, they pay their money.  Old age, you had a t-shirt to get through a dumb 12 minute commercial block.  You don't want Jim to tell a story when he gets here?  No, I guess. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, that's a figure.  Write it down.  Just write it down.  Ronnie needs to know?  Yeah.  I'll write that right now.  And then we got to make believe.  I don't know what he's fucking up to here.  I just.  Sam, I don't know either.  I'm not up to anything.  No, I know what you're up to.  What?  You're, you want to take over this entire fucking place.  At some point.  And you're going to push all of us out.  Not today.  Would you put a fucking bullet in the back of Opie's head if it meant that your career  moved ahead a notch?  No, I wouldn't kill Opie.  Just a notch.  If you could get away with it, would you?  Just a tick. 
[00:57:00]  No.  No one would ever know.  You got a family.  No, I couldn't do that to your family.  Would have, like, you saw that he was getting into the elevator, but the elevator car wasn't  there, and he was just going to step into the fucking pit.  Would you let him go?  Would you not yell out?  And it would seem like an act of God.  Yeah.  So you're thinking about it.  That would be something I would consider, because I wouldn't have to worry about his family.  It's not my fault.  What's the Jeffrey story?  Now we're in.  All right.  You're a slow writer. 
[00:57:30]  Well, I was talking at the same time.  Well, you can't multitask.  No.  You're a young kid.  You should be multitasking.  Oh, boy.  Ronnie's like...  That's what you're hiding?  Well, he's pissed about it, so I want him to tell the story.  Oh.  Okay.  But that's a live read.  You're going to need to read that in...  Oh, really?  ...an hour or two.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it for?  That'll be a good story.  Ashley Madison Establishment. 
[00:58:00]  That website.  Oh, that's an Ashley Madison site?  It's a company.  Yeah.  So what are they doing?  I don't know.  Do you want to do the live read now?  Yeah.  All right.  Here you go.  Well, you know what?  It teaches what they're doing.  You know what?  Yeah.  Because I've done this live read a few times.  I don't know what it's for.  The company's getting ripped off.  We're just taking their money because I'm not selling their product properly because I don't  get it.  All right.  Let's go over it.  You want to go over it?  Yeah.  Okay.  The copy reads, it's no secret, chicks dig rich guys. 
[00:58:30]  True.  Right.  I think Nicole likes rich guys, right?  Lots of them.  For the morning mashup?  Let's face it.  The best way to get in a girl's pants is if she thinks you have cash.  So far, you're in.  You get that, right?  Okay.  Sure, you could try to BS your way at a bar, but that's going to get you nowhere.  Meaning, I guess you don't have money at the bar and the girls know it.  That's why you need ESTmen.com.  Unlike Sugar Daddy sites, which are filled with rich old farts, EST Men is filled with  regular guys who know how to play the game. 
[00:59:00]  What does that mean?  That I'm kind of, now I'm getting a little confused.  All right, good.  At ESTN, men, you don't need to be famous or have a six-figure salary as long as you have  the confidence of someone who does.  So it's like we're lying to women?  I don't know.  Because this is all about how you don't have money.  But if you walk into a bar, women know you don't have money.  But online, they don't know you have money?  Okay, yeah.  That's true.  You can be whoever you want to be.  You don't need to be living in a penthouse.  You just need enough cash to show the woman a hot night out. 
[00:59:30]  So that line makes me think this is a hooker site.  Right.  But they don't want us to say that.  If you have enough money or cash to show the woman a hot night out, that's all you need.  Sound too good to be true?  It's not.  With three girls for every guy, the problem is there's not enough rich guys out there.  Then they go back to the rich guy angle.  Right.  But they already established that you're not really a rich guy.  But the women don't know.  They're hooking you up with women who think they're meeting rich guys. 
[01:00:00]  Well, where the fuck are you going to go with these women?  Like one night, you're going to have to be rich, right?  But where are you going to go to get the job done?  To your car?  No, you've got to go to a hotel.  You need money.  You've got to stay in from the coast.  You need money.  So if you can play the part, there's no better place than estmen.com.  What do you have to lose?  Sign up for your free trial now.  So I don't know what this is.  And I told the salespeople.  They might want to write this better.  I have no idea. 
[01:00:30]  Unless they want it to be very vague.  What does the website look like?  You're an EST man if you're established, successful, or talented.  Damn.  And then it's like, I'm looking for, and you put in what you're into.  I think that we're here to fool the women.  I think that's what we're doing.  And I think it's working.  But how are you fooling the women when you have to bring them back to your shitty apartment eventually?  That's the confusing part.  You only want to be with them one night.  So then that would assume you're getting a girl for the night. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  Maybe get a nice hotel.  But you can't get a nice hotel because you don't have the money.  You're making believe you have the money.  I think you have to have enough money to be rich for one night.  You could take her to the Radisson.  You could.  So you're basically looking for a girl that doesn't, who just wants to be paid.  You certainly want a girl who doesn't know this live read.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  She'll see through it.  Right.  She'll see through it completely.  Are we getting the ladies of the evening here, Sam? 
[01:01:30]  Is that what's going on here?  Um, I don't, I don't think so.  But that's not something I can confirm or deny.  But see, here's the deal.  When you do a live read for somebody, it should be very obvious for everybody.  Right.  But I think they're trying to keep it on the down low.  I think they want it on the down low.  All right.  So they want to be vague.  So I should shut the fuck up.  Yeah, I think.  Let's keep it very vague.  You guys go to ESTmen.com and figure it out for yourself. 
[01:02:00]  Right?  Yeah.  You can go and bang checks.  What's EST stand for?  Established.  Oh, all right.  Why didn't they just go with established?  I thought it was Eastern Standard.  Men.  Eastern Standard Time.  Yeah.  That's right.  I live on the East Coast.  Fool her into thinking that you're an East Coast guy.  Let's go with PSTmen.com.  Let's compete with these guys.  Now, there are others that you were supposed to be with married women.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  They're past that now.  Now you're ESTs.  Now we're all ESTs.  That's right.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We've got Kevin Pollack coming back today.  Paul Mercurio will not be here today.  Are you kidding me?  I blew him off all day yesterday.  What do you mean?  Well, it finally got down to a text.  If you were listening, what happened, Sam?  I don't feel like talking.  I've got to find this text.  Paul Mercurio called Opie while the after show was on.  Opie took the call on the air and invited him.  And Paul asked if he could come on the show today. 
[01:03:00]  Opie said, yes.  Why don't you stop by at 10 o'clock?  All right.  So Paul was...  It was like a little joke.  Right.  So Paul was going to come in here at 10 o'clock thinking that Opie would be here and Opie  would be long gone and he'd be stuck with me.  Right.  And then he called all day yesterday.  Maybe I shouldn't exaggerate.  Probably three or four times.  And then he finally left a text.  But I noticed my text messages from him.  You want me to start from the first one?  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Because he's been at this a while.  July 22nd.  How long ago was that?  That's a while ago.  Opie, what's up?  Was with Anthony on Red Eye.  We talked after the show about my coming back on with you guys.  Me coming back.  I'm up for it.  He said you guys would be too.  Want to set it up?  Maybe for next week sometime?  Paul Mercurio.  That was July 22nd.  What did you say to that?  I never wrote back.  It was seven months ago.  August 2nd.  Oh.  So that's what?  Ten days later about?  Hey man, you up for having me come on? 
[01:04:00]  I'm in town this week.  Can we do something this week?  Left you a voicemail a couple weeks ago but never heard back.  Paul.  Oh.  That was August 2nd.  Then we get to October 19th.  Oh.  I don't hold a grudge.  No.  Hey, Anthony and Opie was wondering about coming on the show.  Are you up for it?  If not, just let me know.  No worries.  If so, I was hoping in the next couple of weeks if that can work.  Please.  Thanks, Paul.  That was October 19th.  Then we get to yesterday, February 23rd. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  My mom's birthday.  Oh, but I didn't hear back from anyone today.  Oh.  Because you told him Roland was going to reach out to him and give him the address.  Right.  To confirm coming on tomorrow and where I'm going and stuff.  Can you let me know if this is happening?  If I don't hear back from you, I will assume it will not be happening.  Would like to do it, though.  Let me know.  Thanks, man.  So that's where we're at.  And you decided not to reach out to him so he could know it's not happening.  Oh, he said if I don't hear back from you, it's not happening. 
[01:05:00]  What am I supposed to do there?  Right, Ron?  He said it.  This wasn't one of the bridges you were rebuilding.  Not yet.  Good.  No, I don't know.  What was the bridge that you rebuilt?  I don't know.  It's very vague.  Yeah.  You were vague.  You're calling me out on that now.  Yeah, I was just wondering if there really was.  I was on that.  From on, I'm like, yeah, he's really rebuilding bridges.  It's great.  And then slowly, like, you know, because this thing is very hard to be awake. 
[01:05:30]  And then I'm finding myself like, I'm not sure if he's even rebuilding bridges.  You just called me on.  I just fucking believed it for no reason.  How dare you, sir?  I just threw that out there.  So people think, oh, look, he's changing a little bit.  Yeah, he is.  He's doing great.  He's rebuilding bridges.  That's how you get, like, a rumor started about yourself, like a positive rumor.  Yeah.  I'm ready to rebuild some bridges, right?  Are you?  I wouldn't.  With who?  I don't know.  Where do I start?  There's so many.  I don't even know where to start.  That's my problem.  Well, what usually happens is...  I would like to know what happened with me and Jeremy. 
[01:06:00]  Ron knows Jeremy.  Yeah.  We see each other.  He works here at SiriusXM.  He was the guy when we were all at NAW fucking shooting for the stars.  And I went to lunch with the guy probably three times a week because we had a love for sushi.  And I liked the guy back then.  And for some reason, now we're barely acquaintances in the hallways here.  I'm like, you do remember, we used to be pretty close.  It's really strange. 
[01:06:30]  And I don't know of anything I did to him.  Well, A, you got him fired.  Let's just get that out of the way.  And his mentor.  I technically got you fired, but you're not blaming me.  No.  But see, I'm a little different where I feel like we're all in or we're all out.  What's the big deal?  I love that about Ronnie.  You can't...  I don't believe in pointing fingers.  I love...  You're already picked this life.  I love that about you because there have been times over the years you're like, all right, 
[01:07:00]  where are we going next?  Yeah, what are we doing?  It doesn't matter.  He just goes with the flow.  But, you know, I think Jeremy might think that you are upset about something because...  Yeah.  But then the other part of it, he's incredibly busy on that side.  Like, he doesn't have a...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  His job kind of sucks, in my opinion, how busy he is.  Right.  But my thought on the whole thing is his time working with us led to this amazing gig he's 
[01:07:30]  got here at SiriusXM.  It's like if you didn't get fired here, then he wouldn't be a VP now.  Yeah.  That's why I also don't think you get upset about things.  No.  You know, because things do work out.  Sometimes it is time to leave a place.  You know?  What are you going to do?  Sit and nitpick about what should have happened.  Look, you know, you talked about Ken, who was the GM.  Yeah.  I went down to Washington.  I was driving through to go to Florida.  I looked him up, and we went out for steak. 
[01:08:00]  Guy looked 15 years younger.  Yeah.  Was driving a sports car.  Came to the hotel and picked me up in his sports car because he wanted to show off a little  bit.  And he actually, during dinner, said, did I ever tell you I love you?  Ken.  Ken Stephens.  And I go, what?  Yeah, I was taken back.  He goes, if it wasn't for you getting everyone fired, I wouldn't have this great life now.  He goes, that job was killing me.  I saved his life.  Well, Ken had three different stations and three different markets. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  So he was in Washington, Philly, and New York, and he used to live on the train in between.  And the funny thing is, like, he came out of sales.  He was, like, the worst people person.  I never saw anyone do this.  His fucking desk, his back was to the door.  He would sit with his back to the door, an open door.  So, like, you wouldn't ever want to really go into his office and be like, Ken, Ken?  That was strategic. 
[01:09:00]  He liked the view, Ron.  He was in New York.  He liked that view from that office.  Nice glass office.  So, but, like you said, everything works out.  No, he lost probably easily 30 or 40 pounds.  He looked like a different man.  And he actually said to me, I love you because if it wasn't for you blowing it up, I don't  know why they blame me.  There were other people involved, but whatever.  Everyone sees that as you, though.  Yeah, I know.  Everyone always says, poor aunt.  I don't know why. 
[01:09:30]  And he goes, yeah, if I didn't get fired, that job probably would have killed me.  Well, here's the other weird thing about it.  Ken fucking cashed out.  They make you cash out.  Right.  It was at the, oddly enough, the last time that CBS stock was really fucking high.  And in the couple years, and you can't sell that stock when you're.  An employee?  Yeah, when you're an employee.  So, he cashed out.  And then every year after that, the stock went down and it was so much less money. 
[01:10:00]  So, everybody would be like.  Like, and then I was talking with the GM at Free FM.  He's like, that fucking Ken.  He fucking is making more money than me sitting on the beach.  And I'm watching my shit.  You know, he was all pissed off.  Yeah, yeah.  And he had a fucking brain tumor.  Yeah, Ken was living on a sailboat.  Yeah, he was.  I've lost touch now, but we were good last time I saw him.  Real good.  So, that bridge I built, I guess, technically.  Don Wickland's never been happier. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, but I rebuilt that bridge, too.  Yeah.  I've told him, you know, thanks for everything.  I like Wiki.  He just wrote me, as a matter of fact.  He wants to know what the big announcement is.  See, we're good.  We write all the time.  He goes, I can't listen to Ron and Fez today.  What is the big announcement?  Like, I know.  Like, Ronnie's going to tell me.  Just say, don't bother me at work, Don.  He goes, hey, since I won't be able to listen to Ronnie's show today, what's the big news?  See, we're good.  You know, the interesting thing about Wiki is all he ever wanted to do was please you. 
[01:11:00]  I know.  But I hate needy people.  It drives me fucking nuts.  It makes me go the other way so quickly.  Like Al Dukes and the stupid pinball machine.  Yeah.  That was such a needy moment.  I had to destroy the pinball machine.  I don't understand it.  I don't expect anyone else to understand it.  But this neediness always drives me.  Anybody who's needy drives you nuts.  It drives me insane.  I'm not even fucking making a bit.  One night, Wiki takes me and Ope and our chicks out to this really nice restaurant. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, really fucking great restaurant.  It's one of those chefs.  Yeah, it's a celebrity chef.  It's the guy who yells at people.  Ramsey.  Yeah, Chef Ramsey.  So he gets us a table in the kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook.  And all Ope did, as soon as we got there, he goes, Ope says to him, I want to sit next to Ronnie so I have someone to talk to.  And I mean, he had went in large for this night for all of us. 
[01:12:00]  And from that point on, I just saw him deflate.  And all through the meal, Ope's like, why are we in the kitchen?  It's so fucking hot back here.  Well, the concept makes sense, I guess.  But when you're in it, the kitchen's 120, 130 degrees.  They have a booth, so you feel fucking awkward because everyone's working their ass off.  And you're sitting there like a king staring at them.  Right.  That made me very uncomfortable. 
[01:12:30]  And you were good enough to let your concerns be heard.  Yeah, he did.  And I, you know, I'm going to break it down a little bit.  I really like hanging out with Ron.  He's, you know, he could talk about anything.  And we don't get to do that often.  So in this, I want to make it clear of where I wanted to sit.  I didn't want to lose my moment.  There was another moment that Wiki's chick actually says to Ope, in a serious moment,  hey, he does everything he can to make sure that you're happy. 
[01:13:00]  And Ope just blew it off like it was nothing.  Like it was nothing.  And I could see that she was like, I'm trying to get this through to you.  You're killing my husband.  That means that Wiki was going home and talking to his wife about how badly he wanted to please Ope.  And how Ope didn't appreciate it.  But in my head, like what people don't know, I handpicked Wiki in the early days.  I liked him.  When we used to go down to Washington, we needed somebody.  And I go, what about that guy?  He was just kind of doing nothing for the company at that point. 
[01:13:30]  But then you didn't treat him well after that as a problem.  No?  I don't know.  I wasn't there for a daily thing.  I know that he did want to please you.  Yeah, he did.  He made my life easier.  See?  Yeah, but that's all I'd say.  You're never there when it's happening.  What?  You're never like, you'll say that like on a serious note, you did a great job.  But while the job is being done, you're like, oh, go fuck off.  Let me tell you this.  I dream at night that he still was like babysitting this fucking channel. 
[01:14:00]  So you don't think that like.  Major fucking drop off since the WIC.  But you don't think a couple years from now, when you're working with different people,  you'll be like, you know what, Gary?  You were a good guy.  You made my life easier.  No, Gary has no business running this channel.  Oh.  We all know that.  Some people will vocalize it and others won't.  He has no business, you know, babysitting whatever you want to call it to our channel.  What's the big difference between the two?  Ricky kind of got it more, I think.  Yeah.  And worked harder. 
[01:14:30]  Knew how to work shit.  And had connections.  You know, Gary, I think he's a smart guy, but I think he should be running music channels.  I think that's his strength.  Not personality-driven, you know, radio shows.  You don't mind Cross, though.  Cross is like, I mean, I like him as far as interns go.  He's good.  What?  Why do you always say that about him?  When is his internship up?  You know goddamn well he's not an intern.  You sure?  Yeah.  I like him, though.  He's up and coming, but we've been at this for so long.  I don't feel like bringing anyone else up. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  I brought people up.  Yeah, you sure did.  I don't feel like waiting for these guys to get it and catch up.  No more catch up.  Come in knowing.  Yes.  You're there already.  Yes.  Rob's good, though.  Rob's going to be all right someday.  I have no use for him.  He's not going to teach me anything.  Gary has no business here, though.  The last person that taught me anything was Eric Logan.  Ouch.  And maybe a little bladder.  Bladder is...  Whoa!  You just made...  That's...  No, I've said it.  I like bladder. 
[01:15:30]  The problem with bladder was that, you know, he was running our channel, and then all of  a sudden the company decided, well, you need to do a lot more for us.  So he doesn't really have time.  And hence, we got stuck with Gary and the intern.  Bladder's another one who's got...  His job is just too hard.  Yeah.  It's too hard for a human being to do.  It's impossible.  Like, when you're like, hey...  He'll be like, can I talk to you?  He's like, yeah, I can give you 45 seconds.  And then they're going to start raining shit on me.  Like, but for that 45 seconds, you got him.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[01:16:00]  Like, he's like, you know, what do you need?  Let's, you know, let's get it done.  But he is a good guy.  There's good guys around here.  Bladder's smart.  He's a smart guy.  And he gets it.  He gets what we're all about.  I'm a fan of Rob Crosses because he doesn't throw any sticks in the way.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, most...  To me, a good PD is like a guy who's going, I'm not going to fuck this thing up.  Right.  You know?  Obviously, most of them can't help.  If I was 15 years younger, I'd be all in with Rob Cross.  I'd come up with him and it would be great. 
[01:16:30]  We're just at different places in our careers.  That's all.  He's going to be good.  He's going to be better than Gary someday.  Wow.  Probably sooner than later.  That's going on his resume.  And Gary's a nice guy, but...  He's going to be better than Gary, quote, Opie.  What?  You know, Gary's a nice guy.  What are you going to do?  Dude, do we have lights yet?  I mean, there are...  It's the same lights.  All right.  Gary and Rob did go to B&H Photo recently and look at lights. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, really?  I mean, it was like, yeah.  That's good.  Like three weeks ago.  That's good.  Why didn't you go down with him, Sam?  Yeah, they wanted you because they figure you're a light expert.  I don't know why they've ever asked me any questions.  Well, you have such light skin.  Huh?  I don't know why they've ever asked me any questions about lighting.  No.  Because I hold a camera in here.  I know how to edit video.  I don't know anything about lighting.  I want to stick around for the big announcement because people are asking, but...  And I owe Ronnie Big.  Why don't I just do the announcement now, today? 
[01:17:30]  Please do it right now.  Right now.  No.  And Fez needs to.  Yeah.  It's really funny hearing you tease it yesterday on the show.  Trying to make him say it.  You're like, what do you got to talk about, Fez?  Nothing.  Well, then we're doing the announcement when we get back.  Nice.  Is Fez making the announcement?  If he doesn't, I'll make it.  God.  It's not up to him anymore.  Really?  I got to get out to Long Island right away today, so...  What's going on out there?  You clamming? 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to do a little clamming.  I'm going to say happy birthday to my mom, even though it was yesterday.  Well, it's still nice.  I might do Islanders Rangers tonight.  I might do a little hockey.  Oh, so you stay out there?  You stay in the old house?  No, no, no, no, no.  Get a little hotel and just chill out.  Oh.  Yeah.  Maybe a little F.H. Riley's run.  Oh, nice.  A little Long Island visit.  Just the old neighborhood.  Mm-hmm.  I miss it.  I'm a suburb guy.  You like it out there?  Yeah, I don't like the city.  I'm fascinated by the city, and I like walking around and checking shit out. 
[01:18:30]  You've been here a long time, too, for a guy.  Ten years.  Yeah.  Ten fucking years.  But why don't you live out there?  Commute?  It was all about the commute.  I couldn't handle it anymore.  Oh.  I know Liam's been out there, and I was like, that's insane.  My chick likes the city.  Yeah.  She likes it a lot.  I want to be in a big house in the suburbs eventually.  Just out there somewhere, like fucking...  Just fucking chilling.  Fitzgerald fucking bulk.  Dude, I want to walk around in the woods.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fucking deer ticks fucking hanging off. 
[01:19:00]  No one bothers me in the woods.  I just want to walk in the woods, Sam.  Westchester.  Just in the woods.  Like, get lost.  Not even hiking trails.  I'll make up my own trails.  I think Westchester's probably the most obnoxious of all the suburban areas, isn't it?  Like Pepsi fucking VPs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Westchester is a pretty obnoxious place.  It's very...  Most of Westchester is very hoity-toity, as they say.  See, I think out of all of the surrounding areas of the city, I like Jersey, because they 
[01:19:30]  always feel they have to defend themselves.  It's not so bad.  Look at this place.  This is great.  Constantly.  Where I think Long Island has a little bit of chip on their shoulder.  And Connecticut feels like they don't even give the fact that they all work in New York  the fucking respect that it deserves.  I just see them as carting money out of the fucking New York and taking it up there to  their giant houses.  Oh, yeah.  Not giving anything back.  No, nothing back.  Nothing.  Fuck you.  And they have obnoxious kids. 
[01:20:00]  Fuck yeah.  You nailed Connecticut.  I love Westchester.  I just hate that everybody in New York refers to it as upstate.  It is upstate.  It's 20 minutes away.  That's upstate.  What's wrong with you?  I have people on my street that call Yonkers upstate.  And I'm not even fucking making that up.  They go, yeah, he's living upstate.  He's doing good.  He's in Yonkers.  But do you realize how big this state is?  Yeah.  Before you should get to upstate, you should be like Albany.  Yeah.  Where does upstate New York start?  You want to go Albany? 
[01:20:30]  You don't go before Albany?  No, I would actually think, when I think upstate, I'm going to at least Catskills up, right?  Yeah, there you go.  That's what it was when I was growing up.  Catskills was upstate.  But Catskills start pretty much right over the GWB.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  Pretty much.  Now, I was saying this thing today.  You know that, what's the bridge up that way?  Is it the Tappan Z?  Yeah.  They're putting in a new bridge.  They're talking about doing a highline deal with the old Tappan Z.  Oh, I know.  And having people just being able to walk back and forth and party on that bridge and hang 
[01:21:00]  out.  Yeah.  Walk and bike and all that.  So why not just fix the fucking bridge and save the taxpayers a lot of money if you're  going to keep the damn thing?  Here's the weird thing.  It's $150 million just to tear that fucking bridge down.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  It's $150 million.  Jesus.  So how about you take the $150 million and fucking fix the damn thing and we're all good?  How bad could the bridge be?  It's not in good shape.  No.  It's been around way too long.  And why are the cars still driving over?  Because they're going to get somewhere. 
[01:21:30]  People are going over to the bridge like, I don't know.  They're fucking shaking a lot.  Every time you go over the Tappan Z, somebody in the car has got some kind of story about  when it was built and how much weight it was meant to support and that it's way past  all that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Because you can't leave New England without going over that bridge.  Yeah.  So people since like the 1960s have just been pounding that bridge.  Yes.  It's the only bridge to get out of New England.  Fuck.  How the fuck could that be?  I don't know.  And it's been around forever.  And there was never...  There was supposed to be a new bridge a long time ago. 
[01:22:00]  But I hear the new bridge is going to be like a billion dollars.  We need a new bridge.  Something like that, right?  I think they were pushing a billion dollars to build a new one.  I'll tell you what.  That's crazy.  I think I can get rid of that bridge for half the fucking price without even looking into  it.  I'll just do it myself.  You give me the money and I'll worry about getting rid of that fucking bridge.  You can do it for $75 million.  Yeah.  Does shit can end up in the water, though?  I don't give a fuck where it goes.  I'll give out a couple of Puerto Rican guys six mil and put bank the rest of it.  I like that idea.  You know, when I was living down in Florida, it was called the Sunshine Skyway. 
[01:22:30]  And that was the bridge that got hit.  And there was like fucking people were driving over the bridge in a storm.  A fucking tanker hit it.  And people went into the water.  And it's bigger than the Tappan Z.  Right.  And what they did is they built another bridge but left the old broken span there so that  when you're driving over that bridge, you would just look over, see the broken bridge next  to you, and get a feeling of height.  Oh, my God.  You know, you would immediately think, what were the people in the bus thinking when they 
[01:23:00]  were over the fucking side?  What were the fucking people with their families thinking when they drove over the side?  Remember, wasn't it in Connecticut, one of those bridges, one of those panels fell?  I know there was one in like Minnesota, right?  There was one fucking in Connecticut.  Look it up.  And that caused like, you know, the country to start looking at bridges and try to fucking  reinforce them because they said this is going to happen a lot.  How long was that?  Probably 20 years ago at this point.  It was one of the bridges on the way to Connecticut.  You know, one of the, you know, little ones going across just some little water. 
[01:23:30]  Well, the infrastructure of all these things is at least, you know, the highway system  probably goes back 50, 60 years.  Right.  So there isn't a lot of stuff that's been done.  The weird shit is like, you only considered a bridge when you're going over a river.  But just think when you drive through most cities, you're just on this.  You're in the air.  Yeah, you're in the air most of the time.  Fuck yeah.  From Newark all the way to Manhattan, you're pretty much in the air.  And no one's acting like, oh, we're driving over a bridge now. 
[01:24:00]  No, no, you're.  All those things could crumble.  Fuck yeah.  And then there was a famous video, I think from the early 90s they have, of a bridge  completely just collapsing into either a river or a fucking lake or something.  I didn't think of this shit until today.  They all just come crumbling down?  Yeah, man.  It was a real famous video before the internet.  But it got, it made its way around.  Someone's going to have to help us out.  Wouldn't you hate it if you had something that before their things were viral?  And you were like, uh.  No kidding.  I bet fucking some brooders like, I can't fuck. 
[01:24:30]  You know how fucking hot this would have been.  Right, of course.  We got Jim Jefferies.  We're going to break though, is that alright?  Yes.  It's fine.  You just flew in?  I've just, yeah, yeah.  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a week too.  I just landed, yeah.  You've been trying to get a hold of me?  Well, through people.  I got, I texted you yesterday.  I think you're texting my wrong phone.  Oh.  That's the company phone.  I was upset that you didn't reply to be honest with you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You don't have this number?  I don't know. 
[01:25:00]  I gave you this number a million fucking times.  You can't just hold up a phone and go, you don't have this number.  That fucking asshole.  Well, I can show you that my text, there's no text from you.  I can say the number over the radio and see if it's the right number.  And Jay Moore does the same thing.  I give Jay Moore the new number a million times and he still fucking writes the old phone  and then gets mad at me that I don't get back to him.  Jim shouldn't fucking get blamed on the fact that Jay Moore is fucking needy.  That's not right.  True.  Good point.  That's not right.  Good point.  Don't drag him down to that fucking hole.  Very good point.  Alright, we're going to break. 
[01:25:30]  Jim Jefferies joining the show next.  Are you playing Hasbrook Heights?  I'm playing Bananas or whatever, but I've just been told that there's only tickets available  for the late show tonight, Saturday, and the early show tonight's sold out already.  Oh, good for you, man.  So, yeah.  Where'd you just fly in from?  LA.  And then I was meant to get a town car to drive me here that they had booked.  And then just out of Seinfeld or something, some cunt just took my car.  Really?  So they were Jim Jefferies?  I rang up the driver and you could actually hear him going, no, no, no, you're in the car 
[01:26:00]  with me.  I'm like, I'm like, I'm really not, mate.  What was that name in Seinfeld?  Murphy.  Was that it?  Was it Murphy?  Yeah, and they were Nazis in the back of the car.  So you had to take a cab?  Yeah, I took a cab.  Yeah, I can do it.  That's all right.  I'm not that much of an imbecile.  But you're just mad someone took your car, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I stood around for a while and I hadn't slept and I just came in and I didn't  get upgraded on Delta, so they're on my bad books as well at the moment. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  Oh, yeah, I'm fighting the good fight.  All right, good.  We're going to talk to Jim Jefferies next.  Ronnie B in the studio and maybe Kevin Pollack in a little while.  Stay there.  We got Ronnie B today.  And we got Jim Jefferies today who just flew in from L.A.  And we just did a whole set on pinball machines and bridges. 
[01:27:00]  So, Sam, I think we can take another break.  What?  We just did 15 minutes of radio.  It wasn't on the air, it wasn't.  So how about you start recording this shit?  I am literally amazed at this, though, that Jim was saying that he's getting a brand new  ACD.  ACDC, yeah.  Yeah, and I did not know that they made new pinball machines.  Oh, there's one company, Stern, that's still making it.  Another company called Jersey Jack, which is coming out with a Wizard of Oz pinball machine, 
[01:27:30]  which it looks like it's going to be a real cool machine, but it's a bit of a gay fucking  premise.  Well, the Wizard of Oz.  Yeah, because you'd have, like, you'd be in your house and off to the woods, and you're  just like, what am I doing?  Pinball, for me, is all about fucking hot chicks.  You know, I like those old machines where it's just got, like, just for no reason,  some bitch, like, in a bikini laying on a snake.  Right.  And you're like, this is a bikini snake.  And you gotta shoot the ball between her legs.  Yeah, yeah.  Into the hole. 
[01:28:00]  Jesus.  Are they making a comeback, pinball machines?  I don't know if they're making a comeback, but I think...  To this day, if I go to a joint and there's a pinball machine, I'm throwing money in.  Yeah, I think they're definitely getting more popular for people in their houses.  Yeah.  Because they're making, like, they'll make, like, the standard, they're making an ACDC  one now, and then they're making all these limited edition ones, like the different albums  and all that type of stuff, with slightly different features on the playing field and  all that.  How many you got?  At the moment, I've got two, but then I'm trying to buy a house at the moment, so I want 
[01:28:30]  about six or seven.  Didn't the show hook you up with one, right?  Indirectly?  There's a guy who gave me a discount at Stern, yeah, but I never got one for free, but if  they're listening right now, I'd like this one for free.  We probably shouldn't show you the Al Dukes video, then.  What's that?  The Rolling Stones rare fucking pinball machine?  No, no, there's a brand new Rolling Stones machine that came out two machines before,  but it wasn't...  I didn't like it that much, but this ACDC one seems a lot cool.  You might want to see this. 
[01:29:00]  This is a classic moment from about ten years ago.  Al Dukes, another needy guy.  Wow, look at all the dislikes of this video.  Who's Al Dukes?  Anyone who loves the fucking pinball machine.  Wow, man.  Al Dukes came in, he was trying to, like, I don't know, make me happy, brought in a Rolling  Stones pinball machine.  Oh, the really old one where Mick Jagger's, like, standing in the middle of the back glass.  I know the one.  This pinball machine, extremely rare.  They're not that rare.  Oh, then I don't feel as bad. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's rare-ish there'd be a couple of hundred left in the world, but it wouldn't  be...  Well, play the video.  To this day, I get death threats over this video.  No joke.  Yeah, Al had broken your foosball table, and then, right, when he was trying to make up,  and then you...  I'm sledgehammering his fucking gift that he gave me, the Rolling Stone rare pinball  machine.  Look how this looks like it was shot in the 70s also.  Yeah.  This whole...  Oh.  And then I fucking... 
[01:30:00]  What happened to the sound?  It's hot.  The sound on this is amazing.  It's hard to tip one of those over.  What happened to the sound?  I have no idea.  That's probably a different version of the video.  Do you got another version of it?  Just the box alone's worth a bit of cash in that one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  The people are just pissed that you would have destroyed this...  Yeah, they're like, how dare you?  Because supposedly it's rare or something that a lot of people want.  I don't know if you know this, but people who are really into pinball, a lot of them  are nerds.  Yeah.  They take this stuff very seriously.  I'm trying to enter the pinball world championships, because I'm getting quite good at playing pinball. 
[01:30:30]  Are you really?  But, you know, I just don't want to be in a room where I'm the coolest person.  You always want someone cooler.  Yeah, you always want someone cooler than me, so I'm not letting down the rest of the  room.  Like, you know, I don't want to be the Fonzie of any group.  I kind of like that theory.  You know, in my neighborhood growing up, and I don't know if this ever happened anywhere  else, but we always would have it at the hoagie shop, at the sandwich shop. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  If you walked in and your friend was playing the pinball machine and you yelled flips, he  had to move over and give you the other side.  And this was just like a rule.  Wow.  So you would just yell flips, and he had to give it to you, because we didn't have, I  guess, all that much fucking spending cash that we were playing a lot.  So you could fucking piggyback into somebody else.  So if anyone came in, you always had to yell no flips.  Really?  That was the...  You had to yell no flips.  You had to yell no flips before they yelled out flips, or else you had to fucking give them 
[01:31:30]  half.  One of my favorite pinball things ever, because I always, whenever I'm in a certain town,  I try to find where our local pinball machines go online, and I just go down and I play a  bit.  I played the Little People's Convention of America recently, just a couple of months  ago, which was a great booking.  And I'll tell you something about a dwarfs convention.  They don't mind being called dwarfs.  They don't hate being called midgets.  There was literally thousands of them.  But why is dwarf okay?  Because it's dwarfism.  It's an actual condition. 
[01:32:00]  That's all it is?  Yeah, yeah.  Dwarfism.  Why can't you say, I saw a midget?  Because they don't like midgets.  They're different than midgets.  For some reason, they don't...  Okay, with midgets...  That's their end word.  Midgets are in proportion, and dwarfs have the bigger foreheads, like they're trying  to look taller.  They're more interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  They're more...  I saw Little People, Big World.  I'm in.  I like that show.  I did this convention.  Where was it, TLC?  Yeah.  Dwarfs everywhere.  I'll tell you something.  I didn't know it when I got there, but I thought it would just be adults, but dwarf kids.  A dwarf toddler, fucking adorable. 
[01:32:30]  Makes you not want a regular kid.  You're like, so cute.  Where you're like, I want that one.  Can we find that online anywhere?  Now I want to see.  They have this room for all the dwarf kids.  So when do they not become cute anymore?  Is the question.  Like at three or something.  They're the same as regular kids.  Right.  Anyway, so they had this room for kids, for all the kids, right? 
[01:33:00]  And I'm good with kids, right?  So I went in, I was hanging out and we were playing on the video games and stuff.  They shouldn't have given the dwarf children pinball machines.  They rented a whole lot of stuff.  I was like, oh, it's pinball machines.  Because a dwarf child can't reach both flipper buttons.  They have to work in tandem with one on each flipper.  Oh, the arguments.  Yeah, right.  And they've got to get on the box, too.  Yeah, they've got to stand on a little, they've got to stand on a crate.  Someone wasn't thinking this through. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, so pinball isn't for the dwarf community.  It's very prejudiced.  Do they like your material?  Well, see, the thing is.  Because you're pretty edgy.  Yeah.  Did you have to do a shorter set?  Yeah, I, no, no, they were all right, actually.  I was the only non-dwarf comedian on the show.  The others were all dwarf comics.  There are a few on the circuit.  Tanya Lee Davis and Brad Williams and stuff like that.  And they talk about their dwarfism the whole time?  Of course they do, yeah, but it's weird. 
[01:34:00]  Do you like those type of comics?  What, disabled comics?  The one that, well, yeah, a disabled comic, that's all they talk about, though.  No, I just, yeah, look.  But I guess it's a tough spot.  What are you supposed to do?  I've got a lot of respect when they don't, but they have to address it.  So they have to do a few jokes.  I've got a friend in Britain called Chris McClawson who's, he's blind-blown, like can't  see a single thing, has to be walked onto the stage, and then he does his set.  And he does a little bit at the beginning, and in the early days of his career, it was  all, you know, I'm blind, this, that, and the other. 
[01:34:30]  And now he tries not to do that and just do regular material, and I think people are sort  of waiting for the, come on, do the joke where, do that joke where you go, is there  anyone in the room after a joke fails, you know, do all that crap.  How the fuck can you be a blind performer?  Especially a comic.  Or just a person.  Just a living person.  But I'm just saying, like a comic, like you really want to feel the room.  You guys study their faces and stuff, right?  It's tough.  It's tough.  There's another guy in Britain, I don't know, there's another guy in Britain who's deaf. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  And his problem is he never knows when to come on.  Like he tries, they have to wave him on, he's like, all right, I'm on.  Wow.  And he, less than the blind guy, doesn't know whether he's killing or not.  Right.  Because, you know, it's all off sound.  You can sort of tell faces and stuff.  You can tell, you can see people laughing.  I think it would be tougher to be blind.  Of course it would be tough to be blind.  Blind's the worst one of them all. 
[01:35:30]  I'd give up all the other four senses just to be able to see, I think.  Whatever I had like that, I would also have to include alcoholism in it.  Because I would just fucking drink every day, no matter what I had.  I would drink to oblivion.  Yeah.  And be bitter, like a bitter part.  Yes.  People were fucking asking.  It would be great because you could get out of a lot of shit.  Uh-huh.  You know, like weddings and like, how can I go?  Right, right.  I can't fucking see.  Well, I had a blind friend who had quite a hot girlfriend.  And the thing was, she was all right. 
[01:36:00]  She was quite a nice girl.  She was really hot.  But the thing is, if any guy should really go out with an average looking girl with amazing  tits, like that would be your whole thing.  Right.  She has to have really nice tits.  Then her face can be anything.  But I felt like that was the waste of a hot woman.  To be with a blind guy?  Yeah.  Like, he should be able to actually look at a person's personality.  Right.  That would be a nice thing for him.  Living in New York, once again, you see the blind people every once in a while.  I don't know how the fuck they do it.  When they're wandering around by themselves. 
[01:36:30]  And some of them don't have a dog or a person with them.  How about the stick swingers?  Some of them are like, fuck, I am swinging this.  I'm going to fucking hit something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I can't even count the amount of times, because it's the same woman in my neighborhood,  where all of a sudden you're just waiting at a light, and all of a sudden you hear to  your right, help me, anyone, anyone around?  And you look, and she's like, you know, needs help to get across the street, because she  can't figure out the lights.  Well, they've got that foot braille stuff, and the beep, beep, beep.  We're very nice, the blind people. 
[01:37:00]  Well, we're just getting all that shit.  Except this country, where the rest of the world, currency, is fucking different sizes.  I don't know how fucking mean you are to your blind that all your notes are the same fucking  size.  That's why Ray Charles had to be paid in ones.  The rest of the world, it grows as the currency gets bigger.  Right.  And there's little watermarks and little things on it that you can feel the different ones.  So if you're blind, I mean, people could be ripping your off line.  If you're blind in America, yeah, yeah.  If you're blind in America, that's probably where that saying comes from. 
[01:37:30]  I never heard the Ray Charles thing, so he was like, all ones.  He got paid all in ones.  It was in the movie where it's just like, yeah, he got paid all in ones.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought Jamie Foxx had to be paid in ones.  Yeah.  I got confused watching that.  Same guy.  Yeah, he only needed that for stripper money.  Make it rain.  He was terrific as Ray.  That's the whole thing.  That's why you guys have still got the...  Everyone else went to coins, and America goes, I will have notes still for ones, which  is the most useless thing.  Everyone else went to coins because you have a tipping culture, and people don't want to leave 
[01:38:00]  a coin at the bar.  No.  They want to leave a note like that.  You guys don't tip?  Actually, I don't take coins anywhere, do you?  No.  I'll just throw any fucking coin back.  I'll take quarters still.  I know.  Oh, I don't.  But not so much anymore because I don't park on the street.  Yeah, I take quarters occasionally, but I'm still not quite sure which one's a nickel  and which one's a dime and a beanie for years.  Yeah.  I'm still not quite sure.  They're all useless, though.  You can't do anything with them.  Nothing.  Oh, Stray, we got rid of the one and two.  We just fucked them off.  Had them for years, just got rid of them. 
[01:38:30]  Ronnie, actually, I put my change in a jar, and then when the nephews and nieces come  over, I look like a big shot.  I take out plastic baggies and I fill them up for them.  I put them in the end of a sock.  They're at that age, though.  They're like eight, nine, ten, so all of a sudden they're leaving my house with a big  fucking baggie filled with change.  I put them all in the end of a sock and smash my girlfriend in the head and just bring  lippy.  And I say something witty at the end, like, keep the change.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good.  I really like that.  Smart ass.  You're going to do that bridge thing, huh? 
[01:39:00]  You were saying?  See, now we've got to redo everything, Sam, because you didn't hit record.  I didn't realize it.  I already know the story, and I've got to make believe I didn't hear this.  Well, it's not a funny story.  I just was going to climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge because my girlfriend wants to go  over the bridge, so I said I'd do it.  Yeah, but I don't get to talk to people that do that, so that's fascinating.  I would love to do that.  You said you'd be too scared.  That was your exact word.  You said I couldn't do that.  No, no, no, no.  I said I would do it, but I would be scared.  Oh, you would be scared.  Yeah, being scared doesn't prevent me from doing things, but I acknowledge that as I'm 
[01:39:30]  doing it, holy fuck, I'll probably be a little scared.  Because there is an element of it could fuck up.  Like, you know that, like, did you get that clip of that girl bungee jumping where it snapped?  Oh, yeah, we did that on the show.  That was great, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was.  You know what I mean?  Where you actually think...  No one's fallen off the harbour.  There's a lot of people who committed suicide in the same way they do off the Golden Gate.  I don't know if I could bungee jump.  Can you bungee jump, Ron?  No, I wouldn't do it.  The other thing, though, from the other day was the guy in that suit, that kind of  flying suit that hit the fucking mountain.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the worst.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:40:00]  They reckon if you haven't bungee jumped by the time you're 30, you'll never do it.  Yeah, I think I'm done.  Well, how do you get back up once you're hanging there?  They lower you down.  They lower you down.  Oh, okay.  They'll pull you back up.  If they pull you back up, I think that would be worse than jumping.  Sure.  Oh, I thought they lowered you into like a boat or something.  I think it depends what you're...  I mean, if you're bungeeing into a fucking river, then I guess they've got to pull you  back up instead of drop you in the river.  It's one of those stupid activities where you think, who was the first cunt, though?  No shit.  Someone had to fucking try it.  Some guy had to try it.  Well, didn't somebody do it with vines like years ago? 
[01:40:30]  There was like those native guys that they had to cut their vines.  Idiot Abroad.  Do you watch the show?  No.  I like Idiot Abroad, yeah.  I love Idiot Abroad.  I can't find the travel channel.  That's the problem.  There's a lot of channels I can't find.  I'm a fan of the show, and every week I've got to try to figure out where it is.  You're absolutely right.  But they had Carl, well, in the end...  Pilkington.  Huh?  Yeah.  In the end, he only jumped from like two or three feet, but there's a tribe that they  use the vines.  And they haven't figured out where they're fucking head planting into the dirt, but just enough 
[01:41:00]  where it's not breaking their neck.  If you could find that scene from Idiot Abroad, Sam, that'd be great.  There's also no give to the vine, right?  I don't know what the point of the vine is.  Yeah, I don't know.  The vine just seems to be an accessory for idiocy.  I wasn't paying attention.  It's got to be part of their culture.  I've seen that thing.  Some kind of manhood test or something.  Yeah, but there's a lot of those African tribes where they have something they do with their  foreskin and stuff like that.  Right.  It's all just horrible. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Can you find that clip, Sam?  Idiot Abroad.  Just foreign people in general are stupid.  Would you bungee jump there, Kevin Pollack?  Would I bungee jump?  Yeah, that's what we're talking about right at the moment.  First of all, I'm not sure how that's your business.  Second of all, I went to three stores.  They didn't have original.  Fuck.  Because chocolate chip crap.  What is this?  How do we get off on the wrong foot?  Three fucking stores, I went.  I tweeted Kevin Pollack yesterday because he asked me if I wanted Danish today.  I said, no, I want Entenmann's original crumb cake.  What are you laughing at? 
[01:42:00]  I actually went to three fucking stores being wanted to try to find it.  It's hard to find.  But you asked me.  Grandmothers say things like that.  Like, bring me this specific cake.  First of all, it was meant as a fucking joke when I tweeted, can I get you anything?  And then the answer is yes, as a matter of fact.  I'm going to be very specific with what you can get me.  Sam, what's the problem with this?  I almost got us all into this fucking crumb cake.  The polite thing would have been, no, thanks.  Just, you know, your presence is the presence. 
[01:42:30]  What is this cake?  Is it just a cake that you enjoy?  Entenmann's original crumb cake?  Nothing better.  Sorry.  Impossible to find.  I'll tell you what, it's better.  It's fine because they had to jazz it up.  The same cake with fucking chocolate chips.  Everything's better with chocolate chips.  What are you talking about?  Nothing's better.  Let's cut that shit up.  We're going to find out.  We're going to find out.  Yeah.  We're going to give the ultimate thumbs up, thumbs down based on the actual.  They wouldn't have put the chocolate chips in if they didn't think it improved the situation.  Yeah, but then they have to go like extra crumb.  And it's like just the original.  Do you see that they're selling chocolate chip cookies now with no chips? 
[01:43:00]  My wife buys those.  Yeah.  Gluten free or something like that.  No chips, but she loves it.  Don't get me started on the gluten free.  Why?  Oh boy.  It's all over LA and it's driving me fucking nuts.  Really?  Oh my God.  First of all, this is a brand new discovery that gluten's a problem.  Right.  I love a bit of gluten.  I can't get enough gluten now.  Gluten glutton.  I want gluten in front of people who don't want gluten.  Yeah.  Sometimes I order gluten without the extra bits.  That's perfect.  Just a bowl of gluten.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Gluten has made its way to the East Coast there, Kevin Pollack.  Extra gluten.  And my wife got it in the house.  She loves it for some reason.  Chocolate chip cookies without chocolate chips.  That's crazy.  So the gluten is something with the wheat, right?  Yeah, but somebody told me it's also protein.  I'm confused.  I don't know.  I just find the whole concept.  I think it's that it bloats you or something like that.  But that's food, right?  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're describing food.  My girlfriend and I went to Disneyland and there's someone behind us literally in line  saying, can you tell me what items are gluten-free? 
[01:44:00]  I almost killed her.  I almost killed this person.  Are the corn dogs gluten-free?  At Disneyland.  Well, you go for the crap food.  I mean, this is the thing.  Of course.  Yeah.  We fixed the food thing.  Where's the mouse and where's the crap food?  This is what happens when you get there.  When we were growing up, food was really fucking bad for you.  We figured it out where it's not too bad now.  And it killed everyone.  We don't have to go any further.  Yeah, it did.  Did I ever tell you about it?  I was seeing Michael Phelps' ex-girlfriend for a little while and I went to Disneyland  with her and I get stopped in the street like once a day for someone asking for a photo 
[01:44:30]  or something like that.  But in Disneyland, because it's a concentrated area and people are standing next to you in  a queue for a long time, I got stopped like eight times, right?  She's just broken up with Michael Phelps.  And I thought, she'll be fucking impressed by this, right?  Right.  And she turns to me and she goes, I love your level of fame.  It's so manageable.  She goes, if I was here with my ex-boyfriend, we wouldn't even be able to walk around. 
[01:45:00]  No.  But at least we'd get on the ride straight away.  Right.  And I thought from that moment, you cunt.  But I still saw her for another month.  Michael Phelps' ex, huh?  I'll tell you something about fucking Michael Phelps' ex.  You put no effort in.  Because no matter how good you think you're fucking at, you're not fucking her as good  as the greatest athlete that ever lived.  There's no way.  The lung capacity.  This guy burns 10,000 calories a day.  Right.  And he's stoned.  Yes.  She was the girl that had the house with the bong.  She still has the bong. 
[01:45:30]  Anyway.  Is that what she calls her?  I'm just coughing cigarette phlegm up on her back.  This guy's got size 20 feet.  You know.  And he goes, he takes her from backstroke to butterfly.  He's just changing.  Every lap is different for her.  But on the upside, I don't look like I have Down syndrome.  Yes.  So there you go.  You're winning.  I once had an argument with her.  I just went, can you shut the fuck up about him?  We don't know for a fact that I'm not a better swimmer.  We don't know that for a fact.  It has not been tested. 
[01:46:00]  I've never timed myself.  Right.  But I can tell you one thing.  When I swim, I'm pretty tired at the end.  So I put a lot of effort in.  So you've got to think I'm going pretty fucking quick.  That's brave to take that on.  It really is.  It really is.  I'm going to follow the guy with 97 gold medals.  See how that goes.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think there's something wrong with you.  You want to see the bungee jump?  This is old school.  It is on the vines?  Yeah, they don't have a bungee.  So I don't even know why they call it a bungee officially. 
[01:46:30]  It seems like you pull your legs off.  Go back where you see the natives doing it, where they're doing it from like 30, 40 feet  up.  There's no take.  There's no give.  I've seen a face plant.  There's lots of footage of this in the net.  This should be.  Look at this guy.  Oh!  Would you do that?  That is leg.  I think that was the vine.  They tied it up their balls.  But the vine does have a lot of...  Isn't there a bit on the end of his cock or something?  There's something to do with cocks involved. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, really?  They got there always.  Look at this fucking Waterworld tower that they built.  It's just fucking awful.  Why does he get a regular t-shirt?  They're trying to convince Carl.  Because they give him away.  Oh, man.  That's awful.  Isn't that crazy?  These guys are jumping from...  They're trying to convince Carl to do it?  Yeah, yeah.  In the end, to give it away, he jumps from like five feet.  But these guys are jumping from 30, 40 feet from this tower like Ron described perfectly. 
[01:47:30]  And they're faceplanting into the dirt at the end.  Oh, boy.  It's a crack.  How are they not getting hurt?  The crack is all the bamboo.  I don't get it.  The crack is all the bamboo in the sticks.  And then they got little kids doing it.  The fact that Carl Pilgrim said, what is the crack?  He couldn't have figured out.  Right.  I do notice that they're picking up the jumpers from the ground.  Three or four people gather around instantly.  Right.  Picking this person up so fast as a way to say, look, if you're injured, shut the fuck up already.  Nobody wants to hear it.  What do they have tied off on their dicks?  Because they tie...  One of the vines are tied to their cocks. 
[01:48:00]  You have to measure your own vine.  There's an element of risk.  You have to...  Is there?  It's just an element.  That was the greatest understatement used of the word element.  I love Carl, man.  I want to get him on the show.  I've got to find a travel channel now.  I'm telling you, this idiot abroad thing is a great show.  It's good.  It's good.  I'm a little glued to it, yeah.  Because, I mean, he gets to go around the world and he fucking hates it.  And I also love that they fuck with him halfway there.  Yeah, of course.  By the way, you're not going to quite get to the North Pole.  Well, first, you're going to have to climb up the side of the mountain. 
[01:48:30]  And swim with sharks without a cage.  With the guitar player.  Right.  This cake is okay.  Just okay.  You went to three stores.  I've eaten a lot of fucking cakes.  Well, I went to...  You know what?  I went to the first store, right?  And they didn't have it.  And I said, you know what?  You want to be late?  Or do you want to get the cake?  And I said, I got to get the fucking cake.  It's all over Twitter.  I got to get the fucking cake.  A guy that's been in 66 movies had to wander around New York trying to find me stupid cake.  So good on you.  And by the way, how happy do you think I was when I got to the third store and I asked and 
[01:49:00]  I said, yeah, we don't have that.  You think I was pleased with the clerk?  Didn't they get that went down quietly?  Me and Ronnie were talking about you earlier.  I fucking liked you in Cop Out, by the way.  Thank you.  A movie that I did like and I will still defend to this day.  Bruce Willis one?  Yeah.  I liked it.  I auditioned for that.  Did you?  No, I didn't get it.  We know now.  We didn't see it.  I love the people that go, look, you don't have to kiss Kevin Smith's ass anymore.  You can now officially say you hated the movie. 
[01:49:30]  I'm like, no, I liked the movie.  You know.  I didn't see the movie.  It's not going to be on my greatest comedy list or anything, but I liked it.  Oh, was it a comedy?  Yeah.  You auditioned.  What part did you audition for?  The guy in the backseat of the car.  That way they rested.  Sean William Scott.  That was good stuff.  That was a good part.  Yeah.  Sorry you got fucked on that.  It was a shame.  That's bullshit.  It was terrific in it, too.  Yeah.  In fact, that might have been on a different level. 
[01:50:00]  I think it was one of those ones.  I might have gotten a call back.  It was one of those ones that they wanted me to do an American accent.  And sometimes my American accent's awesome, and then sometimes it's just fucking shit.  Yeah, it slips.  You ever hear his American accent?  It's terrific.  Can you do it for us?  I'm not going to do it on the spot.  You've done it?  It's too early.  Piss off, dude.  Come on.  Hey, you do your Australian.  I'll do my American accent.  All right, then.  Oh, that's good.  All right, then.  That was very good, actually.  I enjoyed that very much.  Oh, that's a wonderful American accent.  Thank you.  Thank you so much. 
[01:50:30]  You son of a bitch.  It's just great to be here.  Wow.  We look sweet, nigga.  I can't do it at the moment.  I tell you what, though.  Can you do Christopher Walken, you fuck?  We're very nervous about doing talking and walking.  Because it's just a conversation?  You're stressing me and Ronnie out.  Do you do a good Christopher Walken?  I can't believe this is stressful.  We're a little stressed out.  First of all, we're trying to figure out our part in the whole talking and walking thing.  It's not an interview, and we're literally going to do this.  This is all I want. 
[01:51:00]  You got to do it, though.  I thought you were doing it.  I got to do the party.  I'm not kidding.  I got to do this Oscar party.  It's really important.  I got to do the Oscar thing.  No, you're doing a Tweed thing.  What are you going to do from the stage?  Wait, are you doing your Oscar show Sunday?  Yeah, it looks that way.  Do you have to host an Oscar party on the air?  Oscar party on the air.  He does it every year.  He has dresses in a dress.  I went to an Oscar party yesterday for Global Green.  To watch each other.  And Leonardo DiCaprio was there, and Orlando Bloom, and all that type of stuff.  And I had the green carpet. 
[01:51:30]  And there's nothing worse than, like, when you have to be told, when you're walking along  the carpet, and they have to tell the photographers that you're a celebrity.  This is Jim Jefferies.  And they're like, great.  What does he do?  I'm a comedian.  I don't want to do this.  It's the walk of shame.  Unless you have the most famous face on the planet, it's the walk of shame.  Is it?  It's horrible.  When Usual Suspects opened at the fabulous and annoying and pretentious Cannes Film Festival, 
[01:52:00]  the movie hadn't come out yet, right?  I mean, I had done A Few Good Men, and Spacey had done a couple things, but really, this movie  was going to kind of jump him, obviously, with the Academy Warden.  And, of course, Stephen Baldwin.  Yeah, well, if you want proof that the movie is lightning in a bottle, you needn't look  further than the fact that Stephen Baldwin's really good in the movie.  So we're walking down that phalanx of photographers.  There's literally 2,000 on either side.  It's crazy.  And they're all yelling, Gabriel, Gabriel, because Gabriel Burns in the lineup. 
[01:52:30]  They don't give a shit about the director.  They don't give a shit about me.  Spacey.  Nobody.  They're yelling, Gabriel, Gabriel.  Gabriel, Gabriel, look this way.  Yeah.  That fucking Irish bastard.  Wow.  Yeah.  All the chicks want Gabriel Burns.  Holy fuck.  It's that dark Irish thing.  They all think they can save him from himself.  It's fucking annoying as shit.  I saw fucking Katie Couric hitting on him.  Oh, God.  On fucking TV.  She's like suddenly finding herself.  She lost her mind, right?  Yeah, she was like.  This one's Katie.  She used to have the Today Show, but she suddenly.  Oh, she used to have a husband. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That one.  I know that one.  And then she actually did a show that she's never done before.  And one of those interviews, instead of just sitting down and interviewing, they go  to eight different places.  Right.  And they're walking down the street.  Yeah.  And I'm like, she's trying to fucking pick this dude up.  How good is that?  And he was like, you can tell that he does so well.  Although he's like, whatever.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yes.  She seems like she's wild.  Yeah.  When those cameras are off.  Yeah, I think that's it.  Which newsreader, out of all the newsreaders, would you most like to fuck? 
[01:53:30]  Probably Cronkite.  Yeah.  Well, wait.  That's a guy.  People laugh when I say Diane Sawyer.  She's old, too.  I'm married to Mike Nichols.  She's old.  But in a day.  Yeah.  She's still all right.  With those camera effects.  With the camera effects.  She's really.  There's an Australian.  With the Vaseline on the camera.  Sandra Sully was my one grown-up.  Who the fuck's that?  Is that Australian shit?  Australian newsreader.  We've got newsreaders.  We're not from Australia.  You just.  Our news isn't spectacular.  Is it every day?  Do you have the news every day?  It's just once a week. 
[01:54:00]  But some days it's just like, Steve's lost his bike.  And the late night news.  Steve found his bike.  It wasn't stolen.  He just misplaced it.  Isn't Steve a dickhead?  Good night.  Do you laugh that we don't know anything about Australia?  I have no fucking idea.  I sometimes get beaten up a little bit after I do this show on the internet.  Like, people write to me that they think I don't give a good representation of Australia. 
[01:54:30]  That I sort of slag us off too much or give you guys a corny representation.  But I think I'm pretty fucking accurate on this show.  There she is.  Sandra Sully.  Oh, she's alright.  She's nice.  Yeah, she's lovely.  Lovely to Sully.  She always did the late night news.  So it was like she was tucking you into bed.  Oh, I love that.  As it were.  Did she ever show a little cleavage right now?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I think there's a video one somewhere.  Nothing better than Latin weather women.  She once had like a.  Holy fuck.  Tits McGee?  It's every city now.  Yeah.  Tits McGee weather.  You ever seen that footage of that woman that was doing like a late night quiz show where she vomits? 
[01:55:00]  Uh, you gotta refresh my memory.  It's seen.  I feel like I've seen it.  Late night quiz show already we're in trouble.  It's a great fight.  Like Argentinian girl vomiting or something like that.  There it is.  That's the bird here.  Alright.  What is this about?  She's doing these quiz shows where you ring in and you go, oh, I'll pick the letters this way, the letters that way.  Very popular in Europe, these things.  So was she pregnant and had a little motion?  She had no idea it was even coming.  You know what I mean?  Like she didn't even brace herself or look around. 
[01:55:30]  She comes back up for a bit.  Does she?  Okay.  Mine.  That's great.  I'm better.  I'm better now.  Wait, it comes again.  She came on a tonight show.  She goes, she was having heavy menstrual problems.  Right.  And for a minute there, I thought she was speaking English with a really heavy accent.  No, no, no. 
[01:56:00]  I've found log so far and I'm working on spot.  I got got.  I got mop.  It's that.  Oat?  Oh, but it's in the...  Spot.  Spot?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's an old one.  What is this?  It's new Swedish game show, Make Me Puke on YouTube if you want to check it out for yourself.  Who dislikes a video like that?  That's hilarious.  Just a hot chick vomiting.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  Anything with hot chicks, really.  Well, yeah, that's true, Jim.  That is right.  It makes it better.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Peanut butter and jelly hot chick.  Hey, we should start a website, just hot chicks doing weird shit.  Yeah, there's lots of those websites already.  We could even call it that.  Hot chicks doing weird shit dot com.  That's mine.  Or hot chicks just sitting there.  Yeah.  That would work too.  Talking and walking with hot chicks.  Right?  Talking and walking.  Today, we're going to see a great set.  A fantastic set.  This particular cleavage is world-renowned.  I'll tell you why.  You get your whole face in there.  Always a treat. 
[01:57:00]  Motorboat?  Don't motorboat.  I don't care.  It's there for your choosing.  I can't believe you guys are intimidating.  You're making up parties.  You're not going to come to hell.  No, I'm actually doing it.  I'd love to be there, though.  So, I'm bomb them.  I have to say no.  I'm so bomb.  I love it.  You want to do talking and walking?  As I said, Cliff Clavin and Homer Simpson, that's all I got.  No, you're Jim Jefferies.  Yeah.  Talking to Christopher Walken.  You're yourself, and we're just hanging out on stage talking.  Oh, I...  This is a new podcast I'm doing. 
[01:57:30]  It's very intimidating, but I can do it.  See, it feels intimidating.  See, here's why it shouldn't be.  I think I've done it.  Jay Moore does this as well.  Oh, yeah.  Brilliantly.  He loves a good walking.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's brilliant at it.  No question about it.  But in this case, it's really just talking.  It's just a couple guys talking.  One of them happens to be, you know...  One of them is going to be getting all the laughs, and the other guy just sits there like  an imbecile.  No.  You really think that's what it's going to be?  I really think it's if Mel Brooks was leading Carl Reiner. 
[01:58:00]  I think that's the way I'm thinking of this show.  Wow.  Where Carl's, like, trying to catch up.  You guys, come on.  I can't believe you're...  That's really strange to me, honestly.  I'm going to have to rethink the whole fucking thing.  No, no, no.  It works, dude.  Seriously, it's amazing.  We're just intimidated.  I just have to work, or else I'd fucking be there in a heartbeat.  But I...  You know...  What is the thing you're doing?  I'm doing an Oscar radio thing that they're...  You're hosting.  Yeah, they're hosting these fuckers down the hall, have this whole thing set up. 
[01:58:30]  Call them to...  There's been no good movies this year.  It's all shit.  We like the artist.  Did you see the artist?  War Horse made me cry.  Why didn't it make you cry?  I haven't seen War Horse.  It's about a fucking horse.  Of course you're going to cry.  Horse movies always make you cry.  There's a war, and there's a horse involved.  Running all through it.  Yeah, and then the horse goes from...  He's with the Germans for a bit, and then he's with the French for a bit, 
[01:59:00]  then he's back with the English where he belongs,  and then they think the horse is fucking dead,  but the horse isn't dead, is he?  And he comes back, and...  If you haven't seen the movie, the horse doesn't die.  So at the end, he's Peace Horse.  Finally, at the end, he's Peace Horse.  Did you see the movie?  No, I can't fucking see a movie about a horse.  I'm an adult.  There's lots of action in it, though.  But why do we cry about a horse instead of the five billion guys who died during World War I?  We don't care about them.  I'll tell you why.  Because the horse didn't choose to be there. 
[01:59:30]  It wasn't his war.  It wasn't his war, mate.  Of course, those guys were drafted.  I'm sure they didn't want to go.  No, during those wars, they were all up for it.  Is that right?  They couldn't wait to go?  Back then, Vietnam is when we got sloppy and lazy, right?  But before that, people were like, oh, you've got to go.  Do your bit.  Those old World War I posters, they had them in Australia where it was like a picture of a soldier with a woman.  And then there was the guy who didn't go to war, and he was just like dateless. 
[02:00:00]  Like, fucking hell.  You've got to do your bit.  That was the way that phrase came from.  Are you not watching Downton Abbey?  What's the matter with you fucking people?  I met this old bloke.  He would have been in his 80s, I imagine, in Britain.  And I was chatting to him, and he started talking about the wars.  This was literally like me getting drunk in a bar, chatting to an old bloke.  And in London and everything, all the tube tunnels, all the underground and everything,  they were all used as air raid shelters.  And you can't imagine how often London was bombed.  Like, every couple of days, the fucking siren went.  They all went underground.  I was talking to him, and he goes, wasn't that terrifying? 
[02:00:30]  He goes, nah, best time of your life, right?  And I said, why?  And he goes, well, most of the guys were off at war.  I faked some illness.  I faked some illness.  As soon as I heard those sirens, we all go underground.  We're in the dark in these tunnels.  He goes, it's just like women are nine to one.  They all think they're going to die.  They want to be hugged by a guy.  He goes, I was down there banging everything. 
[02:01:00]  He goes, I used to walk around looking forward to the siren.  To go on the ground.  To go on the ground.  To cop some fields.  Literally a fucking coward.  It's one thing to get out of Vietnam,  but to not go when they are bombing your neighborhood.  Jesus Christ.  Where your mom lives.  It's still like, I can't go.  I've got to do this Oscar party.  I'd love to be there.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got to do the Oscar party. 
[02:01:30]  I understand.  It's a whole thing.  It's a big, it's a giant annual.  I think you two would be great to go on.  Oh, I know.  It's really ridiculous.  Thank you.  I got a tweet.  Yeah, he's got a tweet-a-thon.  I'm tweeting.  He's got the Oscars tweet-a-thon.  I'm supposed to promote the website.  I don't know the name of it yet.  Talkandwalking.com.  Talkandwalking.com.  That's what I'm tweeting for.  Yeah.  Oh, this is an actual thing, Talkandwalking.  Yeah.  I mean, I thought this was something you just wanted to do with me now.  Yeah.  To kill some time. 
[02:02:00]  I'll do it with you some other time.  Yeah, yeah.  Caroline, Sunday night.  Other time than that.  No, I'll be flying back.  I've already got a flight.  Yeah, I understand.  I've got to get back to L.A.  But I'm in L.A.  We'll do it in L.A.  We'll do it in L.A.  We'll do it in L.A., guys.  You're going to be doing Talkandwalking?  We could just hang out together in L.A.  That's the whole thing, actually.  Yeah.  But like his friends.  I was just hoping.  Exactly.  I was just hoping to hang out.  That's really what it was all about.  That's why I created the whole podcast just so I could hang out with people.  To make friends. 
[02:02:30]  Yes.  Ronnie, this is perfect for you.  I've got to tell you.  I hope he's not going to let it go.  It's perfect for you.  But what did you figure out who you're tweeting for?  I didn't look it up.  Kids with cancer, probably.  Oh, that's great.  No, I really thought.  If you really need to know.  Yeah.  Tweeting doesn't pick up until the second or third hour.  That's when I start to tweet.  They want me at 7 o'clock.  Is this a tweeting show?  It's tweetroast.com.  Tweetroast?  Tweetroast?  Well, I think it's the idea to be snarky.  You're just lending your name to anything. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I'm getting desperate.  I'm getting desperate.  You're right, Jim.  Are you getting paid long enough to know that this isn't really happening?  Tweetroast.  Yeah, a bunch of us are doing it, though.  Tweetroast is the worst name since War Horse.  Is this just where you slag off dresses during the Oscars?  I ain't fucking doing the...  You're going to fashion police?  Oh, fuck no.  You're the fashion police.  Oh, I'm not doing the fucking...  See, look.  You're Joan Rivers.  Look at the website.  It looks nice. 
[02:03:30]  Tweetroast.  Look at that.  I'm just looking forward to Opie Radio.  How dare she wear those shoes?  What was she thinking?  You know what?  Seriously, to stand out, you've got to get racist.  I'm going to.  Just racist.  I'm going to go with Chink in the Armor.  Whenever I can.  See, that's too funny.  I don't like that.  That was bad.  I don't like that.  You know, the rules came out.  What?  How to handle the whole...  Racism thing?  Yeah.  You got that?  Rules?  The Asian Media...  Association of Asian People. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  They thought they'd draw some lines?  Yeah.  What's their letterhead?  I thought everyone was being nice to him.  Now the Asian Media Group, whatever, they have guidelines issued.  Is this coming out of Commonness China?  Dude, this is...  These guidelines?  Yeah, these...  No, isn't he?  He's from Korea.  And where is he from?  Taiwan.  Actually, he's born and raised in California, but his parents are from Taiwan.  He's Pac-Ram.  Oh, Taiwan, no.  You've got to see this, though.  Good quality product.  This is hilarious to just read.  You know, this is the... 
[02:04:30]  You read this?  Yeah.  This is the first player that ever had bound feet and then made it to the fucking NBA.  Just these tiny little feet.  So he really appreciates those sneakers from Nike.  Yeah.  He really...  He wears a 7 and a 5.  He's a great basketball player.  I don't know if we're following the guidelines there, Ronnie.  Be careful.  Yeah, and I don't want to fuck up.  I'm with him.  You got some of the guidelines?  The actual guidelines were taken offline.  You just can't say...  What do you mean taken offline?  It must be in some article somewhere. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  No, they're taken offline.  That means you're all right now.  You can say whatever you want.  Yeah, Deadspin's pretty good for this shit.  Everyone tweeted me yesterday about it, and I don't...  I should have fucking saved it.  Surely you've had a few more rock apes in the NBA.  Like, you've had that...  What's the...  You shouldn't call them rock apes.  Uh, what's the...  I'm a real...  Wow, that's a new one for us.  It's an Australian term.  Sorry.  Welcome to...  Rock apes.  Rock apes.  You know, the other derogatory term for black people. 
[02:05:30]  And then...  I've never heard that before.  It's because the Asian people are like that, but they don't move as much.  See, you can't understand racism from another...  You know?  It's like when the Tootsies and Teetsies were killing each other.  We're like, why?  You're all black.  Stop it.  I feel bad now.  Without Anthony here to back up my racism.  Oh, yeah.  He would have been loving it.  He would have been shooting a gun into the ceiling.  He would have been all in.  Here's the guy lines.  Chink.  You know, you gotta be careful with that one. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, don't use that.  What does it say there, Sam?  Pejorative.  Do not use in a context involving an Asian person on someone, or someone, I think, who is Asian American.  Extreme care is needed if using the well-trod phrase, chink in the armor.  Be mindful that the context does not involve Asia, Asians, or Asian Americans.  So what, you change that to gook in the armor?  See, that's just as bad, I think.  So wait, so then you should be able to use chink in the armor. 
[02:06:30]  You should be able to use chink in the armor, then.  No, not when it is in the context of Asian Americans.  What?  He's an Asian American, so that wouldn't...  But what else can't you say?  You can't say driving.  You can't say he's driving to the basket?  No, because then he'd lose his body.  Oh, I see.  It's such a...  You can't say a chink in the driving?  No.  No, you can't.  Everyone thought they were clever saying we finally found an Asian that could drive.  Right.  Toward the hoop.  Toward the hoop. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  They're giving you a little bit.  They say this is part of the sport of basketball, but resist the temptation to refer to an, quote,  Asian who knows how to drive.  So how did we come up with that, then?  We just pulled that out of thin air?  Just so.  Or do we all have experiences with maybe...  But why can't we have a movie called White Men Can't Jump?  You know what I mean?  We have a movie called White Men Can't Jump.  That's pretty descriptive.  They're not even dancing around a metaphor there.  They're just categorically saying that we can't jump. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  And we're going, oh, all right, then, yeah, fair enough.  I actually am very bad at jumping.  White Men literally can't jump.  But there's a double entendre about him driving, and all of a sudden, whoa!  Oh, shit.  Just say, Asians can't drive, and then we're fine.  But if you actually refer to it as...  And they probably can't drive, because all the signs are in English.  I think a lot of them can speak English.  Yeah, I think he can speak English.  I haven't seen many. 
[02:08:00]  And he can definitely read.  What's the next one?  And what group put this out, by the way?  This was the A-A-J-A.  What is that?  Now the Jews are involved?  Unbelievable.  Are you allowed to compliment him on his math skills?  Like, say something nice.  Why isn't that insulting?  You're good in math.  It's the Asian American Journalists Association.  He's got a three-point and a two-point.  I don't have to tell him what that adds up to. 
[02:08:30]  I-shape is the next thing on the list.  I-shape, this is irrelevant.  Do not make such references if discussing Lynn's vision.  Oh.  I-shape.  Uh, food.  Is there a compelling reason to draw a connection between Lynn and fortune cookies, takeout boxes,  or similar imagery?  Oh my goodness.  In the majority of news coverage, the answer will be no.  Look, it's not our fault he plays at MSG.  Is it?  Yeah, it's there for you. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  Isn't Kobe Bryant half Asian or something?  No.  No.  I thought he had been a sub-relacist.  No, I thought he was like Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods got a little of that in him.  Here's the weird thing.  Have you ever seen an Asian sports writer in your life?  No.  This is an amazing thing now.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen an Asian sport?  Only the sumo wrestling.  Apart from that, what else have they invented?  I would imagine maybe a little soccer.  No, that's actually their own.  That they came up with.  Oh, that they came up with.  Ping-pong was invented by the British and it was called whiff-waff to begin with. 
[02:09:30]  Because that's the sound that bats made.  It was called what?  Then I'm going to say, thank goodness the Asians came along and changed the fucking name  because the Brits would have destroyed that sport.  Thank God they made playing ping-pong cool by changing the name of it.  Whiff-waff anyone?  Whiff-waff.  Shall we whiff-waff?  Just care for a bit of whiff-waff.  The British are very proud of that.  I once said that to them.  They got all fucking uppity about it.  I bet they did.  Whiff-waff.  Whiff-waff.  The British call it whiff-waff.  So what sports did the Asians invent?  Well, karate.  That's self-defense.  It's martial arts.  Martial arts.  They didn't think of it as a sport then. 
[02:10:00]  It's an art.  Sumo wrestling is their only real big thing.  Or maybe high-low.  Is high-low their one?  No, that's like Spanish people or Hispanic or something.  That's kind of fake.  But spaghetti is there.  That's all rigged.  Spaghetti is there as a fireworks.  Yeah, spaghetti and fireworks.  The fireworks.  Is that a sport?  Yeah.  What the hell else do you need?  Yeah.  And being bad at driving.  Leave the driving and the math to us.  You got your fireworks and your...  It's spaghetti.  Took that from the Italians.  Also on the list is martial arts. 
[02:10:30]  You're writing about a basketball player.  Don't conflate his skills with judo, karate, taekwondo, etc.  Do not refer to Lin as grasshopper or similar names with associated martial arts stereotypes.  What about Kato?  Kato, I think, would be okay.  Okay, good.  Me love you, Lin time.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  That's clever.  Come on.  In what bizarro world is that offensive?  Are you saying I have to throw out all these t-shirts? 
[02:11:00]  It says avoid.  Really?  Avoid?  Avoid.  Avoid.  What's wrong with you?  Me love you, Lin time.  Don't.  Don't.  Yeah.  Just say don't say that.  Draw a line in the sand, you mamby-pamby son of a bitch.  I like that.  This is a lazy pun on the athlete's name and alludes...  It's not lazy, by the way.  No, no.  It's pretty clever.  It's not lazy at all.  Alludes to the broken English of a Hollywood character from the 1980s.  No, that wasn't a character from the 1980s.  That's from...  That's what they used to say in Vietnam and stuff when they went to the brothels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was full metal jacket. 
[02:11:30]  That actually happens in real life.  If you go out to Asia, they will actually say that to you in certain places.  They've embraced the me love you long time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're right.  I'm telling you, in Thailand and everywhere...  I've traveled the world.  I've slept with prostitutes.  Uh-huh.  Nah.  Who also slept with Michael Phelps.  The last thing on the list?  Yeah.  Yellow Mamba.  No.  The nickname that some have used for Lynn plays off the Black Mamba nickname used by NBA 
[02:12:00]  star Kobe Bryant.  Right.  It should be avoided.  Asian immigrants in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries were subject to discriminatory  treatment resulting from a fear of a, quote, yellow peril that was touted in the media,  which led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act.  Yeah.  But, you know, there was other things that happened.  They're taking all the fun out of Lynn Sanity.  The 1940s.  Not happy.  Roland believes Lynn Sanity is spelled with a Y.  Well, sure. 
[02:12:30]  Like a girl.  Yeah, Lynn.  Whiff-waff, huh?  Whiff-waff.  I learned something today.  I don't make this shit up.  That's kind of fruity.  I was taking a bath.  One Saturday night.  Is there anything else to that article?  That's it.  That's about it?  Yeah.  That's the guidelines to follow, huh?  That's the guidelines.  He had a shitty game last night.  He got crushed.  He got crushed.  He was intimidated.  But what's the...  I don't understand what he's doing.  I had a show to do.  He's had a couple of good games, and now he's had a couple of bad games.  Oh, not a couple.  He had more than a couple of good games. 
[02:13:00]  He went on a tear for a couple of weeks.  That was truly inspiring.  He had one game where he had a lot of turnovers, but he still played pretty good.  And last night, it was just shitty across the board for him.  I had to do a show.  I was, but I didn't see anything.  But my prediction was that LeBron was going to put on a clinic.  He was going to try to show this kid how it's done.  Is that, in fact, what happened?  Maybe they figured him out by now, eh?  Huh?  They might have figured him out.  No.  They're beating the shit out of him, though. 
[02:13:30]  They're fucking trapping him all over the place.  Scratching him.  There he is.  He's on TV right there.  He's just doing a great job.  Wait, that's a wholly different...  Oh, wow.  That's a different one.  Asian.  Oh.  Sorry.  Are you...  Wow.  That's the guy from the Karate Kid.  That's not him.  No, it's not him either.  No, it's not the guy from the Karate Kid.  Oh, no.  That's the original Arnold from Happy Days.  Oh, man.  He's great.  What are you doing?  Just terrible. 
[02:14:00]  Horrible.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Remember the Words Hurt pamphlet?  This thing reminds me of the Words Hurt.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah.  We're doing regular radio, right?  We go back to regular radio, finally.  I'm like, fuck yeah.  We're going to, you know, get right back to where we were.  And the lawyers hand us this huge...  It was, I guess, a little more than a pamphlet, and it was titled Words Hurt, and it was all  this shit.  Oh, my God.  All this shit.  Don't you love when you read something like that, and you learn a new word?  And they're like, don't read this on the air.  We're dead serious about it. 
[02:14:30]  It was the best comedy I've ever read.  Of course.  In my life, we were howling how funny this was.  And we're like, you really are trying to take this seriously?  Of course they did.  And what were the words?  It was all like...  Carpet muncher, whatever the fuck.  Yeah, all the stereotypes.  You wouldn't normally even say, they would go out of their way just to find words, that  even though we're not obscenities...  Smegma.  Don't say smegma.  We'd rather you not say smegma.  Iraq...  Is smegma cheese?  Is that smegma?  What's smegma?  Smegma is like the cheese between your balls and your leg, right? 
[02:15:00]  That's how I always know it.  No, I think it's what builds up under the foreskin there.  If, in fact, you have a foreskin...  Thank you.  If at all, then it's like...  That's offensive right there.  Yeah.  Is that an actual medical term for it?  Smegma?  Smegma is, in fact, the medical term for the shit that builds under the foreskin.  Iraq, you got the pamphlet still?  No, I don't have the pamphlet, but I was skimming through the bit.  There was a section that they had a fill-in-the-blank test that you had to take.  We had to take a test. 
[02:15:30]  Where they were setting you up to say bad things, but you had to overcome that and come  up with better things to put in those.  It's a clockwork orange.  Yeah, it is.  This is crazy.  You had to watch.  They hold your eyes open.  And then the worst thing is they played Beethoven.  Why?  You know, that was my favorite fucking performer.  Yeah, it was just like that.  Like, you're kidding.  I couldn't believe they weren't kidding.  They were dead serious.  I wish they still had that.  It really is amazing how much they can miss the mark by, you know, in terms of, how should 
[02:16:00]  we pair these guys back a little bit?  What do you think would be the best tack to take?  Like, oh, I know.  Let's give them a giant book of words that they shouldn't use and shove it down their  throats.  That'll work, right?  Yeah.  How could they possibly make a comedy bit out of that?  And not to bore everyone, but this went way past the FCC regulations.  Of course, yeah.  We understood the FCC regulations.  When you're in this business, you understand.  This was way before.  You know Carlin's bit, the seven words you shouldn't say.  Of course.  Yeah, it's sad.  Oh, no.  Our list was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.  It was unbelievable. 
[02:16:30]  You couldn't say scumbag.  We weren't allowed to say scumbag.  Well, you really shouldn't.  They say scumbag in Australian politics.  Like, they do.  Like, in Australian politics, when the two parties meet each other and have an argument,  like, in America, they don't swear at each other.  In Australia, it's broadcast on TV, and they fucking go hell for leather.  Really?  You're a fucking scumbag, you fuck.  Like, they really go at each other.  Well, Romney and Santorum went at it the other night, and I would have loved to see  like some real slap fights. 
[02:17:00]  Right.  But I would have loved to have seen it that way, where they really fucking openly talk.  It'd be awesome, actually.  Wouldn't it be great?  Yes.  I keep waiting for Ron Paul to just utterly morph into Ross Perot.  It's going to happen.  Yeah.  Right?  The wrong analogy is going to slip out.  The economy is like peanut butter, see?  If you feed it to a horse and he chews on it, it'll look like he's talking.  At least he wants to fucking let drugs go through.  Right.  I'm amazed he's been able to hang in there as long as he has.  But he educates me with his answers. 
[02:17:30]  Who's the one that hates the gays?  Who's that one?  Santorum hates the gays.  Oh, sorry.  Santorum.  Who thinks they can go to a place where they can get fixed.  He worked at the place, didn't he?  Wasn't that his thing?  He worked at the fix-it?  He was a counselor at the gays.  Can you imagine how much bumming happens in the fix-it hospital?  Like, can you imagine how many fucking gay sex happens?  Like, it's my last date.  It's like when you try to give up cigarettes.  On the last day, you smoke, like, two packets before your fucking quit date. 
[02:18:00]  Sam, grab me.  If I was giving up gay, I would just be getting a daisy chain of cocks around me.  This is my last date.  Cover me, boys.  Cover me, boys.  Go to the Santorum thing on the iBang.  There's a fucking...  Is this the Interrobank thing?  It is the Interrobank.  I'm all in now, Kevin.  You really taught him how to say it.  You shamed him yesterday for calling it Interbang.  Hence why I had to get your back with the cake thing.  I'm evil.  Is this it?  Yeah, Rick.  The Interrobank.  You knew I wouldn't be able to find the original. 
[02:18:30]  It's hard to find.  But you knew I'd fail.  But I really did want it.  I know.  That's why I went to three fucking stores.  This fucking Santorum, I don't even know what he's talking about here, but he just gets  into this rant.  You've got to just watch it.  It's only a couple seconds.  Available to the American public.  No teleprompters.  No written speeches.  The opportunity to see what's in here.  What's up here.  And what's burning down here.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  What's on to see? 
[02:19:00]  There's a pill for that.  That's his sphincter.  What could he have possibly meant, though?  Wow.  He's pointing at his crotch at what's burning down here.  He goes, what's in here to his heart, what's up here to my head, what's burning down there  at his cock?  Where else is there?  I mean, he can't say I was pointing at the floor.  Unless he means hell again.  Because he does.  He actually, I think, got mad at Obama for not coming up publicly and saying there's  a devil.  Yeah.  Just admit there's a devil. 
[02:19:30]  Isn't he the devil?  But this is the thing.  You guys have never had a politician who's been an honest atheist.  No.  Like, you've obviously had atheist presidents.  Like, let's be honest, Clinton didn't believe in God.  He's not a God guy, but he did it all.  You know, you have to say you're religious in this country to get in.  Where in other countries, it's actually applauded.  Like, if you are religious, you're saying, oh, don't vote for that guy.  He's a fucking nutjob.  He believes in a magic man on a cloud.  Yeah.  I don't want that guy running the place.  But if your politicians don't follow the magic man, it's like, oh, I don't want, he's 
[02:20:00]  untrustworthy, that science believer.  I want to live in Australia.  They're doing it right over here.  I want to see the politicians fucking curse at each other.  All right.  Well, the Australian, Gillard, the bird who's in charge at the moment, she's openly an atheist.  Really?  Yeah, that wouldn't fly in this country.  Yeah, I mean, we'll take.  Not at all.  Yeah.  We've got a female who's an atheist.  Yeah.  We'll take a Mormon, I think, before, a Muslim, but you have to say, it's not human beings. 
[02:20:30]  It has nothing to do with us.  It's a magical thing from beyond that helps me when I need it the most.  I do get magical help.  Yeah.  And he's always betting on the right team somehow, too.  Yes, he will never go against the wrong.  And, like, Tebow, the thing that was great about Tebow is that he was praying, haven't  we seen black guys do that for, like, fucking 50 years?  Yeah.  Say I want to think.  And no one thought that this was good. 
[02:21:00]  No.  You know, no one acted like, hey, he's a good role model.  And as soon as we had a white guy do it, perfect.  Exactly.  Now we're done.  What do you got?  I got what you want.  Hot off the press.  This just came rushing in.  Wait, is this the list?  Lindbergh has landed.  You got the list?  Oh, I want to be involved.  Oh, you're involved, Norton.  Wow.  Things to dump.  This was when we were on regular radio.  Sexual acts.  Then they have general rules, and then they have all the words they had to dump. 
[02:21:30]  Well, a lot of these are obvious.  They're like fuck, hunt, cock, cocksucker, like the George Carlin stuff.  I like the bit in sexual act that says you can't say raped with a stick, bat, or any other  item.  You cannot spell curse words on the air.  But shouldn't rape just be an umbrella?  Like where it's just, you can't say anything under the rape umbrella.  Right, right.  Why does it have to stipulate?  We, I mean, as far as radio goes, we sort of invented Balloon Knot to get around things.  You remember, Ron?  Maybe Balloon Knot was around before that, but we sort of brought it to radio to get around 
[02:22:00]  some shit, and they even took that away from us.  Did you switch quickly to Balloon Tie?  Yeah.  We ran out of fucking ideas at that point.  Were you guys the first ones to do initials still?  Yes.  And then they got rid of that.  Because we would go, you know, he took his hard P and shoved it in her C and seed all  over her T's.  And everyone was like, fuck, this is brilliant.  I know exactly what you're saying.  And they took that away.  It even makes it funnier. 
[02:22:30]  And I'm like, it oddly does.  I'm like, let's go in front of somebody and let's, you know, let's challenge the FCC on  this one.  Still not as funny as the word hymen.  No.  Hymen's always going to do well.  Breaking or tearing a hymen.  And farting is okay, but not on someone, in someone's face or in their mouth.  Yeah, that's when it got weird, too.  They're like, all right, you're allowed to fart on the air, but you're not allowed to  fart on someone's arm or something.  It was so stupid.  Why can't you fart on a person?  I don't know.  That's still a man's name, Hymen, by the way. 
[02:23:00]  Hymen?  Hymen?  My grandfather, my mother's father.  Wasn't there a swimmer called Misty Hymen?  Born in Leeds, by the way, which makes me half British somehow.  Hymen Klein.  Be more Jewish.  Hymen Klein.  I was going to say, how Jewish are you?  Wow.  Jewington.  Wow.  Weren't allowed to say fisting anymore, fingering, fingering.  A lot of these are obvious, though, to be honest with you.  You couldn't say sit on my face.  Popping a cherry.  Couldn't say popping a cherry.  Rim jam.  Arm wit or she's wit or moist.  Finish on me, hit me on my face.  Rusty tambour. 
[02:23:30]  I really want the Words Hurt pamphlet more than this.  I think there's a lot of this is obvious.  You can say nigger if you're an African-American.  It's actually stupid.  Right.  It actually says that?  Yeah, yeah.  Where, where?  Nigger or nigger.  You cannot say nigger or nigger unless it is said by an African-American.  So, Patti Smith, I'm sorry, your song doesn't get on.  Yeah.  But we can play Everything by Jay-Z.  I just love that they actually wrote, unless it is said by an African-American. 
[02:24:00]  I mean, they really, it would have been better if they said, unless it was said by one.  Well, look at the next one, fag or faggot, when it's clear the word is being used as a derogatory term for homosexuals.  So, they were allowing us to still say faggot like we grew up saying it.  Like, you know, we didn't think of it as in the gay way.  So, you could, I could refer to it as a cigarette.  Well, that's a whole nother fucking trip, yeah.  Yeah.  You and your cigarettes.  Now you're back at fix-it camp where you want to.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I want to be fixed.  Get as many fags in your mouth as possible.  I want to be fixed so bad. 
[02:24:30]  Here's one.  You can't throw feces on someone.  Oh, that sucks.  What?  That's bullshit.  First farting and now this?  Yeah.  A lot of this is obvious.  This isn't too bad.  Great radio, though.  I was sitting around reading.  It is.  This has got to be.  Yeah, I know.  We'll take a break.  It's time to take a break.  Kevin Pollack is at Caroline's tonight.  Last night's show was good.  Yeah.  If Thursdays are a little off in this room, I'm being told. 
[02:25:00]  Because I went on stage and did ten minutes about my amazing draw and that the place,  you know, wasn't half-filled.  Oh, I sold it out last time I was there.  Of course.  It was wonderful.  Of course.  One of the best gigs I ever had.  No competitiveness at all among comedians.  I don't know if you noticed that.  I just went up and did this thing called talking with Cliff.  You know the Thursday night crowd is pretty good.  Tonight through Sunday, Caroline's Kevin Pollack, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100. 
[02:25:30]  And Jim Jeffries competing with you there.  He's across the river, though.  Yeah.  Stay over across the river.  Hasbro Heights, Bananas?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to do it like some type of 1950s movie about where we're at camp, and I'm going  to roll across the river to his gig to pick up some hot chicks or to steal your prized  pig that's like the mascot of your team.  Now we're definitely hanging out in L.A.  That old gag.  All right.  We're going to do some talking walking next, I think. 
[02:26:00]  Fuck yes.  All right.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I must say, we've got a great room today.  The great Ron Bennington to my right from Ron and Fez.  And let's not forget the big announcement today, Ronnie.  Big announcement.  What time?  Yeah.  What time?  For the big announcement.  I think it's going to go quarter to 12.  Feels like 11.45 to you?  Yeah.  Really?  Feels like that, yeah.  I thought 255. 
[02:26:30]  No.  You're not going to do it 255.  No.  What is it?  And I've been trying to get Ronnie to fucking give me the big news, and he won't do it.  I just can't trust you.  Or do you know what it is?  And I go, after all these years, you can't trust me.  Not even slightly.  I trust you less now.  I trust you less now, and I don't hold it against you.  I don't think that you could help not blurting something out.  How quick would I blurt it out if you told me?  Immediately.  Like, if any of these guys said something personal to you about a family member, you would just 
[02:27:00]  blurt it out.  Well, that makes it tough to do radio.  Yeah.  No one trusts me.  You've only just met me.  Can you tell Kevin at least?  You can trust me.  Yeah, I trust you.  What is it?  Cagey bastards.  We were just going over music.  I was going to say, just so people know if they're just tuning in.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin Pollack from 66 fucking movies.  66 movies.  Six of which, quite good.  Who had to get me Enderman's cake.  People are reminding me that you have been in 66 movies, and you're wandering around Manhattan  getting my Enderman's original crumb cake. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  Jim Jeffries.  You failed, by the way.  Two crumb specials and didn't bring you any dessert.  Yeah.  And Jim Jeffries, of course.  What were you going to say, Ronnie?  I'm sorry.  Oh, well, I was just, because we were talking about music, but I just forgot this with Kevin,  is one of the great, I think one of the great musical fucking, one of the great movies about  music, he was in the Wonders fucking thing.  That thing you do.  Give me the rub.  Give me the rub.  Give me the rub.  Yes. 
[02:28:00]  Footloose.  Footloose.  Boss Vic Koss.  You're a Pittsburgh guy.  Yeah, that thing you do.  People thought he was a DJ.  Yeah.  He was actually a mattress king.  Oh, that thing you do.  Oh.  Boss Vic Koss was the mattress king.  That's why he came on the stage and said, how are you sleeping?  How are you sleeping, Pittsburgh?  Yeah.  You know, I feel like you've just been around my entire life.  What was your first movie?  You can't avoid me.  No, but I'm just, exactly.  Willow.  This way.  No, this way.  The little brownies.  Yeah.  Oh, you and Willow. 
[02:28:30]  I fucking love Willow.  Now you're going to pay attention to that.  Now you're going to finally pay attention to it.  Remember the two little brownies?  Do you fucking walkin' thing?  Remember the two little brownies?  You got to hang out with Warwick Davis?  Yeah.  Oh, no wonder you.  Yeah, right.  Brilliant, eh?  Wow.  Remember the two little brownies yelling, this way!  No, this way!  Yeah, I know, I know.  And that was a gigantic first start.  That was a gigantic movie.  Yeah, except that I was, you know, a cartoon character, basically.  I know, man.  We're not.  We've never been cartoon characters.  He downplays.  He downplays.  He downplays.  I dream of being a cartoon character. 
[02:29:00]  When George Lucas brings that movie back out again, you'll be CGI or taken out.  Oh, absolutely.  In a heartbeat.  I love the new thing that Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant are doing with Warwick Davis.  That's great.  I haven't seen it yet.  Life's too short.  I haven't seen it yet.  It's great.  Has it started yet?  Yeah, it started last week.  Fuck!  I meant to...  I got a DVR that.  I forgot all about it.  And you didn't see it?  This kid's getting in the way, man.  I got to tell you.  Get in the way of your TV?  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  I'm just not watching shit right now.  How old's your kid now?  Like two?  Almost two, yeah. 
[02:29:30]  In the way.  Not by attention.  He's kind of in the way.  I got to babysit the little fucker every day.  Yeah.  I love him, Ron.  You're not babysitting if it's your kid.  I thought you would understand the logic of that.  You should understand the logic, Dad.  When you have a kid, there's a lot of time you're just babysitting.  And then there's times you're fathering.  Right.  What's the difference?  When you just got to make sure he doesn't die.  Oh.  That shit.  But what's fathering, then?  They're teaching him stuff.  It's fucking a two-year-old.  What are you going to teach him how to walk?  I can do that, and I'm not his father. 
[02:30:00]  We work on his words.  Yeah.  Is he a struggle with words?  Did you bring the list?  Yeah.  I'm going to bring the list home that I got today.  This isn't like teaching how to ride a bike or giving it life lessons.  Teaching it words, you might as well just bring in a Down syndrome to do that.  He's already shooting hoops.  He's already shooting hoops.  He's shooting hoops, and I'm getting him to make sure he might have a nice fucking arm on him.  Really?  Why not?  Every kid's got to start with the dream of maybe he becomes a professional fucking athlete. 
[02:30:30]  I don't think it's going to happen.  He's two?  I've met your wife.  She looks like she's fairly athletic, but you've pissed in that gene pool enough to suggest that that child's not going to...  I've played sports my entire life.  No, it's not going to...  I've seen pictures of you when you were young.  You wouldn't have done well.  I saw you smash up that pinball machine.  It was amateurish at best.  That was pretty good.  You had a fucking hammer.  I had a fucking mallet.  Oh, well then...  Sledgehammer.  Oh, well then if you...  Only a real athlete could smash up a pinball machine with a sledgehammer. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, I should have punched it, you think?  Yeah, I should have done something more kung fu.  You're probably right about that.  Should have fucked it.  Oh, music.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Your favorite movie.  My favorite movie?  What?  That you did.  Oh, really?  Are you going to go A Few Good Men?  Well, there was...  I say yeah, really, because maybe you'll surprise us.  Oh.  Maybe it's a movie we don't even know about, but you just liked it.  It is.  Deterrence.  A little political thriller.  I played the President of the United States called Deterrence.  Nobody saw it.  But did you like it because that was your coolest role? 
[02:31:30]  You got to be...  Like, did you like it on a personal level?  Do you think that's the best film you're in?  Oh, no.  The best film I'm in is definitely The Usual Suspects.  Yeah, that's a great movie.  And then A Few Good Men is very, very close.  Behind and then Avalon, I think it's right behind.  Why?  Avalon is un-fucking-believable.  You got to put Casino.  You're in Avalon?  Yes.  I'm going to go out and come back in again with the right cake.  You know why?  Because I haven't seen the movie in a real fucking long time.  He's in Willow.  I know.  He's been in everything.  The fact that that's the point I'm making.  The guy's been in everything.  You just feel like he's been part of your life.  I only found out he was a stand-up today. 
[02:32:00]  Thanks.  Thank you, Kevin.  That's a curse of my fucking career.  There's so much going on.  It's a very big week.  And he's a really good stand-up.  But he gets confused for his dramatic roles.  He's excellent in movies, so I don't know if he could be both.  How good could he possibly be?  I'm an appalling actor.  That shows what a good stand-up I really am.  Why didn't anyone see Deterrence?  Because the Paramount Classics put it out and they released it in about four theaters.  Because they wouldn't believe they could be a Jewish president? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  No, he's right.  The movie actually goes to great lengths to explain this.  It basically follows that same line as Truman.  You know, Truman was not elected.  He was appointed in the back rooms because they knew Roosevelt was dying.  So they said, we've got to put a new vice president in there who we're going to be okay with  when Roosevelt died.  Right.  And then, so it's kind of the same thing.  So my character is appointed vice president and then the sitting president passes.  And the movie starts where I'm on the campaign to be elected for the first time or re-elected. 
[02:33:00]  Um, and it's, the whole thing takes place in a, I'm snowed in in a diner and I, I'm faced  with starting World War III.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did it get good reviews at the time?  Tremendous.  Yeah.  And no one saw it?  I know.  That's got to be frustrating.  Fucking killed me.  Tim Hutton is phenomenal in it.  And, uh, Rachel E. Ralph, uh, Sean Astin.  Some good people, right?  Yeah.  Roosevelt was a bit of a cunt though, eh?  Boy, you're in the right country for this. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  I'll give you my reasoning.  All right.  Really?  He's always...  I thought you would just float that, but no, you're going to back it up with an argument.  He was always depicted in films as being, oh, I'm in a wheelchair, I can't get up,  I'm having a hard time.  He's the one, right?  You're faking it?  You're saying he's faking it?  Lazy?  The polio kid.  Is that the one?  Was it polio?  Polio, yeah.  Rickets?  Do you have rickets?  No, just polio.  Just polio.  All right.  So, but he was also the one that put all the Japanese in internment camps, and that  seems to be swept under. 
[02:34:00]  He was the one that made the order on that.  He's always seen as this inspiring guy, and that was probably, next to slavery and what  you did to the Indians, the cuntiest moment in American history.  That made sense at the time.  It did not!  It did not!  These are people who are American citizens, and you put them in fucking internment camps,  and you don't have one museum about it, or one fucking one still left standing where  people can go along and look at them.  Wow, he backed it up.  Well, you know, the thing is, is because they were so far away, they were in California. 
[02:34:30]  If you want to give me an argument.  It didn't happen like on the East Coast.  Oh, I was like to see people on the East Coast were fine.  So the people on the East Coast that were doing this, they're like, what is happening out  there?  Yeah, because you couldn't get to California fast then.  No.  You know, there's a lot of Japanese there.  They put something like 80% of the people in California, the Japanese in California, were  put into internment camps.  Where in Hawaii, where Pearl Harbor actually happened, was only 10% of them were put into  internment camps.  Which seems odd to me.  You'd think that would be the place that would be most passionate about getting rid of the 
[02:35:00]  Japs, but they weren't.  It's gotten very serious.  There's got to be a word you shouldn't be saying, I'm guessing.  Japs, yeah.  I'll tell you something about the British.  The British call the hole in your penis...  A Jap?  A Jap's eye.  Oh, man.  To the extent that they just say it on TV, and a doctor, like you'll be going for a sexual  health check where you go, oh, I'm having a bit of a problem.  He goes, give me a look at your Jap's eye there.  And when they first get it, you're like, wow, what did you say?  But if you spend like three months in Britain, you're using it yourself, it's wonderful. 
[02:35:30]  But like, seriously, it's not an issue.  You're right, though.  The Americans were the fuck-ups by putting them in internment camps.  Jeffers, are they trying to change all that shit in Australia and Britain?  Like they are in America, trying to take words away?  Yeah, but they're still bad words, I guess.  Like, Australia's pretty PC, yeah.  But like, you know, we got the N-word thing happening here.  Australia's still number one brand of cheese is still called Coon Cheese.  Is it?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Because that's the name of the company?  The name of the company is Coon, but the adverts, they still have a guy, like, getting  cheese on toast, toasted, and then he gets it out of the oven and goes, ooh, ooh, and  then he plates it in the mouthful, takes a bite, and he goes, oh, there's nothing like  toasted Coon.  And like, this ad, you can Google it, it's like, this isn't from the 70s, this is a current  ad.  But if that's the name of the company, then it's not derogatory.  That's just the name of the company.  There's a place here in New York.  That's the name of the company pretty quick.  Coon Construction is a real thing here in New York. 
[02:36:30]  I didn't hear you.  Coon Construction is a real company in New York.  And if it's, in other words, if it's...  It's got to be in Brooklyn.  Well, no, it's the guy's last name, is what he said.  Period.  I think...  Why don't you just change your last name?  Maybe I'm wrong, but Coon Cheese comes from Coon of Barabrain.  I can't get past Chapside.  Chapside?  Start this over.  I want to see this.  I'm still offended by Rock Ape.  I haven't done that.  You haven't moved on from that, right?  I'm still Rock Ape for me.  1994.  That's the only one I'm ashamed of. 
[02:37:00]  Huh?  2011.  What?  You want a current one?  Let's go 94 first.  It's Australian Coon Cheese commercial.  This is when Pearl Jam was breaking, so this is great.  And I'll show you some of my favourite spots around Australia.  Coon Namble, Coon Nalpin, Canoe at Ridge, Stuck at Ridge, Coon Awara, Coon Doomerang,  Coon Barabrain loves that Coon taste, man.  Now let's talk to some real cheese experts.  You mean Coon Cheese experts, Peter.  See what I mean?  You're needing Coon Cheese for 60 years or more.  That's Peter Russell Clark.  He was a chef for TV.  60 years.  Come on. 
[02:37:30]  All around Australia, people love that great Coon taste.  Say cheese.  Cheese!  And not one black guy in the commercial, by the way.  Well, that's...  Not a one.  Yeah, we engineered it that way through a genocide.  And now we go to 2011, last year.  Same couple.  Good lesson, kids.  Now it's for a Coon toasty.  One at a time.  A Coon toasty.  Complex, yet naturally well balanced.  The perfect bubbling melt with a bold, up-front tanginess and a nice, smooth, lingering finish. 
[02:38:00]  I'd serve with a slightly chilled bottle of water.  Still?  No, maybe sparkling.  I swear, Chris.  Have you ever seen...  The choice of Coonesses.  Now show me the commercial.  Now show me the commercial for kike pickles.  Have you ever seen the Australian KFC commercial where they're at the cricket?  Okay, I'll let you just watch it.  It's worth it.  While we find that, that's why I asked you about your favorite movie, because then you 
[02:38:30]  get discussions happening here.  Seth in Illinois goes, how is it not grumpier old men?  They didn't even say grumpy.  They went to the sequel, grumpier.  Yeah, grumpier.  All right.  This is...  No, either one.  I'm insanely proud of those films and the opportunity to work with Matthau and Lemmon.  It's a feel of Ren and Anne-Margret and Burgess Meredith.  No, that was fucking sick.  I will tell you this.  My...  A couple of great Walter Matthau stories, if you want.  Yes, yes, definitely.  So first time I meet him, hero of mine growing up, right?  He was one of those character actors that got to be a leading man somehow with a face 
[02:39:00]  like a dog's ass.  But the smartest guy ever on the...  And so first time I'm going to meet him is on the set.  I'm about to play his son, which I played in both films, right?  And right before we shoot the very first scene together is the first time I meet him.  So I'm very intimidated and nervous, and we're seconds away from shooting a fucking scene.  It was ridiculous.  So I try to make small talk like a complete asshole and say, so, Walter, script's pretty  good, huh? 
[02:39:30]  And he looks at me and he said, the script sucks, kid.  I owe my bookie two million.  Wasn't kidding.  Yeah.  Wasn't fucking...  Yeah, he was always at the track, right?  Yeah.  Constantly.  He told me stories about the track, and then the sequel, right?  They're adding Sophia Loren to the sequel.  This is a huge, big deal.  She hadn't starred in a film in 25 years.  And there's going to be a table read, which is like a reunion where they get the cast together.  How was she to meet?  Was she still foxy at that age?  Like Italian royalty. 
[02:40:00]  Gorgeous.  Stunning.  How old was she at the time?  60s or 2, 3.  She was that hot where you still think she'd be producing eggs.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So there's going to be a table read, and everybody's...  I understand, though.  Yeah, of course.  Jim thought he'd bomb with that.  I got it.  No, no.  It did really well.  We got it.  Walter Matthau's in New York doing a play on Broadway.  So the whole cast has to fly from L.A. out to New York to do the table read of the script  before we start production on the sequel, right?  So they literally fly us on the, you know, Warner's jet or whatever the fuck. 
[02:40:30]  And on the plane, everybody is silent around Ms. Loren because everyone's so intimidated  on eggshells.  Nobody wants to say the wrong thing.  So it's almost a silent five-hour flight from L.A. to get here, right?  They were all taken to this conference room in a hotel where we're going to wait for Walter  to arrive so we can do this table read.  He's 45 minutes late.  I mean, the mountain has come to Muhammad.  And no one wants to say a word to this poor woman because they're so afraid of saying the  wrong thing.  Matthau arrives, walks straight up to Sophia, having never met in either of their lives or 
[02:41:00]  careers, and says, great to meet you, love to eat you.  Every fucking chin hits the table.  And she just looked up at him and said, oh, Walter.  And he said, I'm not kidding.  Everybody else, clear out.  Yeah.  Just fucking hilarious, this guy.  And that's a great impression.  This is, by the way, this is why you can never bitch about your career or whatever, because  your stories are insane.  Oh, no.  I'm thrilled to death.  Believe me. 
[02:41:30]  It's the fact that Jim Jeffries is just learning that I'm a comedian rips out my fucking heart.  No, I know.  But it goes with what I've been saying for the last couple of days.  I know you have a great story about meeting me.  Yeah.  I'm thinking he's working on his Jim Jeffries still.  So, Ron, I'm thinking we maybe rhyme Mathau and do a Mathau, like a talk and walking  thing.  We rhyme Mathau and you got another podcast.  You do a lemon?  Can you have them talking to each other?  Do you do those impersonations?  We expect them to do every impression that they're in.  Can you do the impersonations where they're talking to each other? 
[02:42:00]  Can you do a walk and talking to Mathau now?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, yes, of course.  This is crazy time.  Give me anything at all to talk about.  Spaghetti.  I enjoy a nice pasta.  What are you talking about?  Pastas for kids.  That's silly.  You haven't spent enough time in the kitchen, clearly.  You got to use pots and pans.  You got to stir stuff.  Stirring for girls.  That's it.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, that's strong.  That's all right.  That's strong.  If you come down to Caroline's, God forbid, you should get a ticket. 
[02:42:30]  Part of the act is definitely...  I've been selling tickets all fucking day long.  It's definitely going back and forth.  212-757-4100.  If you go there, there'll be some cake left over.  Yeah, there'll be lots of cake.  Get early for the cake.  Bring the right cake.  What is the most obscure impression of you there?  Maybe one we've never heard.  Alan Arkin?  Yeah, I like your Alan Arkin.  I've heard it.  I just got a DM from Albert Brooks who said, 
[02:43:00]  somebody told me that you don't do me anymore because nobody knows who I am.  And he said, that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  I like you.  You kind of do young Albert Brooks.  Is it me?  Am I crazy?  I'm going to go lie down.  Wow.  That's really good.  Crikey.  How was that?  Was that any good?  Crikey.  Did you see Drive?  I know who Albert Brooks is.  Yeah, he's brilliant.  Yeah.  You don't know who Albert Brooks is.  Oh, my God.  You've got to immediately get Modern Romance, right?  Yeah, Modern Romance.  We have to immediately get Modern Romance.  Lost in America?  These are great films.  I've probably seen the movies.  This guy.  Which guy? 
[02:43:30]  Where?  The new movie that Ryan Gosling did, Drive.  No, I didn't see that.  All right.  What are we looking at, Jim Jefferies?  We're all in the place.  Which I like, by the way.  That guy.  It's another great Australian bit of racism.  I love how it's labeled, racist or not, Australian KFC commercial.  He's at a cricket game.  They claim in Australia they didn't know that this was a stereotype.  It's a KFC commercial.  When they made the ad, they didn't know about the stereotype, which we don't in Australia,  but what's the end?  Hold on.  Danny's running in.  Fleshlight?  No.  We're not going fleshlight today? 
[02:44:00]  I was going to go silly for you.  Okay.  I don't know if you remember that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  It's going to trump yours.  What is it?  If we're going racism, we might as well go all in.  Well, watch this one first.  All right.  Let's do this one first.  KFC, Australia.  It's good so far.  You need a tip when you're stuck in an awkward situation?  Too easy.  KFC's crowd pleaser.  A huge variety of delicious chicken and plenty of tasty sides. 
[02:44:30]  It's more of a visual, so I'll explain that.  What you're missing is there was some black people dancing around a white person,  and he wanted them to stop dancing in front of him,  so he held up a whole lot of fried chicken,  and they all sat down to eat,  and they thought, too easy.  And they're questioning if that's racist.  They're wondering.  They're wondering.  It's certainly racial.  Well, we got one.  This is why Danny ran in.  An actual commercial for soap.  From where?  Australia.  Why is it always Australia that's always the bad ones? 
[02:45:00]  You think South Africa would have some doozies coming out of there?  Yeah, you would think, but...  Well, this one's brutal.  This will end this bit.  All right.  I don't see the problem.  How do we know this is strange? 
[02:45:30]  Thanks to lanolin soap in every pack.  What's the brand that everyone demands?  Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy.  And what's the gentlest cleaner on your hand?  Why, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy.  Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy, Nigga Boy.  I get the gist.  Wow.  Wow.  What year are we talking about?  There's no gist.  I would love to know what year.  1865?  1865?  That's just, wow. 
[02:46:00]  What are you doing with that?  I don't think that's Australian.  I don't think that's Australian.  Danny says it's Australian.  From Australia.  There it is, written in pen right there.  From the 40s?  From the DVD.  Would it be from the 40s?  Danny's running it.  He'll probably have more info.  More info on the fleshlight, too.  He does have a fleshlight.  Oh, God.  He's coming in with a fleshlight.  In his hand, he's got a fleshlight.  Oh, God.  What year is this from?  The 50s.  Oh, well, yeah, I didn't realize the same amount of stuff here.  Yeah, it's the 50s.  It was hard to find any information, but the stuff that I could find was that it was just  an old Australian product. 
[02:46:30]  Wow.  But yeah, that's totally legit.  And we didn't even have slavery.  All right, fine.  I don't know what to do with that.  Sorry, you probably didn't have handcuffs either.  It's like you guys get into us for a bit of a racy commercial.  What about the Aborigines?  You actually had them as slaves.  Now, we killed them.  Well, that's pretty bad, too, no?  Yeah.  They were in your way.  That was the British that did that.  The Australians, we were just...  The British did that.  Oh, really?  Well...  Come on, now. 
[02:47:00]  They were the British that were becoming Australians.  Like, they were the first Australians, but they were British.  We hadn't done that.  Weren't they sort of your Native American faux pas, black eye as well?  No, they weren't sort of.  They were the...  Do you acknowledge they're a full person yet?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  I'm trying to learn about Australia.  The government does, but I won't for years.  The government.  Jesus.  And now we're back to fleshlights.  Big Jew population in Australia? 
[02:47:30]  No.  Oh, no, we talked about it last week.  Really?  Not many at all.  Not many at all, no.  No, not many at all.  Six.  Yeah, and they're mostly South African Jews.  Well, at least the ones that I met are mostly South African Jews.  I never really met a lot of Jewish people until I moved over here.  I'm told that I need to tour there, that I need to perform in Australia.  Because you'll be unique and exotic.  They'll come from all over.  Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy, Jew boy.  They'll be in the papers weeks before you arrive. 
[02:48:00]  Now with 90% more hook.  They'll be greeting the plane like it was Beatlemania.  Everyone just wearing little hats with Australian flags on them.  I have to completely revet my act so that it's Jewish, first of all.  Fuck, man.  I didn't think I'd hear Walter Matthau today.  I'm fucking impressed.  I got to pull another one out for you, I guess.  Well, Bad News Bears, we talk about why would you remake that movie.  We talk about fucking remaking some of these comedies. 
[02:48:30]  It frustrates us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they took Bad News Bears and they took out all the cool shit.  Yeah.  The kid's drinking in the car, Walter Matthau's drinking and driving.  Yeah, that would never fly.  The girl I'm saying at the moment is in that movie.  So they don't make the movie is my point.  Let it just be.  Yeah.  Although it still exists, so you can always go back and watch.  Well, it's getting harder, though.  I mean, they edit a lot of that shit out.  Yeah.  And, you know, Blockbuster, you remember, they started editing their movies.  I wonder if Netflix and all these other places will go down that road eventually. 
[02:49:00]  Who knows?  Netflix is, like, just putting movies out now.  Yeah.  Like, they're just going to bypass everyone.  They're going to shoot it and just send it into your house.  Well, no.  On your phone.  I mean, that's great.  Yeah, on your phone.  Well, we had little Steven in here.  His new show, Lily Hammer, it went right to Netflix.  Yeah.  And it's doing well.  E-Rock likes the show.  It's a TV show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a TV show that he shot in Norway.  And everybody's speaking Norwegian but him.  He's speaking, like, just American Italian. 
[02:49:30]  So it's him and subtitles for everybody else?  Yeah.  Is he meant to be speaking Norwegian?  No.  He just...  He said...  He's hiding.  Most people can speak two languages there, so this is not that unusual.  But they wanted to also keep it as, like, you know, fish out of water.  So this wasn't like Sean Connery when he was in Red October, where everyone else was rocking  the Russian out.  And he basically came on set and went, nah, fuck it.  I'm not doing it.  I'm still sticking with Scottish.  I've got a golf game to make.  I've got a cheat time at four o'clock. 
[02:50:00]  I can't be polar.  It is strange, though, to just use an accent in a movie.  Yeah.  You know, like, speak English, but then use an accent.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They've done that with several films.  I thought the only time they did it well was a shit film, but Valkyrie.  That Tom Cruise film.  Oh, yeah.  I never made it through it.  Well, at the beginning, he speaks in German, and then they go, okay, we get it, but we're  not going to do German the whole time.  I'm going to do an English from that.  But what I loved it, when that movie came out, like, it's about an assassination attempt 
[02:50:30]  of Hitler, right?  I was watching fucking Tom Cruise being interviewed on British TV, and he goes, I just couldn't  believe that no one tried to kill Hitler before that.  And you're like, yeah, that's what the Second World War was about, fuck fate.  The whole world.  People trying to kill Hitler.  Like, a lot of people were up for it.  Yeah.  They just couldn't get to him.  You don't think he meant actual assassination attempt?  Oh, there was a few assassination attempts.  There was three or four failed, right?  Yeah, yeah.  A few failed ones. 
[02:51:00]  And then, you know, he just...  He skated.  He did what he did.  Apparently, there's a great mashup.  You know that mashup that comes up every now and then, where it's that scene from a movie  about Hitler?  Oh, there's thousands of those.  Downfall.  Deadfall?  Downfall.  Downfall, right.  So there's a new one where he's complaining why Albert Brooks didn't get nominated for  an Oscar for Drive.  That apparently everyone's telling me that I have to see.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  It's more of a visual, unfortunately, because it's all the subtitles, but...  But who doesn't like to hear a little Hitler in the morning?  Yeah, well... 
[02:51:30]  Most people driving along just turned up.  I'd love...  Yeah.  If he lived through...  Have you ever heard about the worst sitcom ever made in the history of sitcoms?  I've been telling you this before.  The BBC, the British Broadcasting whatever it stands for.  Worse than Hogan's Heroes?  Yeah, pitch me Hogan's Heroes, by the way.  How the fuck did that...  Pitch me that show.  More fucking bizarre than Hogan's Heroes or anything like this.  This is the concept.  First of all, I'll tell you the name of the show, and it went for three episodes before  it got canned.  And the name of the show is Heil Honey, I'm Home, right? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Check, please.  Yeah.  And it's...  It's...  The whole storyline is Hitler lives through World War II and decides to hide out in England,  so he moves over to England, but he lives next door to a Jewish family.  Oh, my God.  How will they ever get along?  It's Archie Parker.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And just to call it Heil Honey, I'm Home, and it started every episode with Hitler coming  in talking to Ava Brown or whatever his wife going, Heil Honey, I'm Home. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  And they thought, it's on Wikipedia.  It exists there.  You ever notice that?  What?  Is that Hitler?  Is that the goofy version of Hitler?  Oh, no.  That's Dad's Army.  That's Dad's Army.  Oh, no.  That might be it.  All right.  Let's see this.  Is it a trailer?  I've never seen it.  It kind of looks like Archie, uh...  Yeah, yeah, here it is.  Oh, there's a theme song.  I've never seen this.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hello!  I am home. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Hi, oh, honey.  And Larry Storch has hit me.  Because I'm home.  Gee, it's great to be Top Gun, but it's nothing like the fun that I get when I say,  Hi, oh, honey, I am home.  Hi, oh, honey.  Hi, oh, honey.  Smile, honey.  Gee, it's great to be back.  Hi, oh, honey, I'm home.  Oh, my God.  Everybody's laughing.  It's like Pramer coming.  I'm home. 
[02:53:30]  Didn't last long, huh?  For some reason.  Really didn't make more than two weeks.  They won't stick with these new shows.  It sucks.  What did I do now?  Give it a chance.  Oh, tonight you were making schnitzel.  No, this is American.  I didn't know it was American.  I thought it was a British thing.  You must be real mad at me, honey.  I'm a very, very bad Hitler.  Come here, baby.  Holy shit.  Don't touch me.  You've been late for your dinner every night this week.  Ava.  Babe, please.  I'm the Fuhrer.  So it's like Ralph Cramming doing Adolf Hitler. 
[02:54:00]  Right.  At 5 o'clock.  On Monday, you had to meet with Goebbels.  On Tuesday, by Rippenstruck.  That's a honeymoonist feel, right?  On Wednesday, I'm Scots and Gemmer.  Yeah, all these actors never worked again.  No.  People held it against them.  I'm Scots and Gemmer.  He's my tailor.  You should see the touch, honey.  I can't believe it's American.  I always say it's British.  See, everyone's more important than Ava.  I've never heard of this before.  Will they tell you something, Mr. Schicklegruber?  Maybe this is just the American remake.  You're talking like American accents.  You and you are just a house painter.  They're doing it like the honeymooners, clearly.  Come on, honey. 
[02:54:30]  Don't get sour.  The parody of this would be hilarious.  Right.  The fact that there's actually...  No, wait a minute.  If you read the bottom, it was made on British TV.  They were trying to play it as a parody of an American TV comedy.  So these are British actors doing the American voices.  So, carry on.  Oh, crap.  England coming over here to the apartment tomorrow, and you don't tell me so I can get something  out of the icebox?  All right, honey, if you're going to get on my back about everything, I'm not going to 
[02:55:00]  tell you why he's coming.  You don't need to tell me why.  The really strange stuff about Hitler is that you never saw him have an off night when he  was public speaking.  Every single night.  He hit it out of the park every night.  You never just saw him, like, flop sweating a little bit.  He never had to go, look, we should kill all the Jews.  Am I right?  Who's with me?  What, no one today?  Hello?  You never heard a criticism of him saying, you know, he felt like Hitler's kind of  phoned it in. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, it wasn't his night, you know?  He never had a Kramer moment.  Right.  Why did this guy commit to the Hitler mustache, by the way?  Yeah, he did the outfit, but he's actually got a bit more of a proper mustache.  Yeah.  Probably because he grew a real one and didn't want to walk around.  I'm just so happy that there was a song that went...  Not until Michael Jordan could bring it back in the Haynes commercial.  But we all accept it.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  Why did he do that?  I have a feeling he wanted out of the contract, showed up on set, was hoping someone would say,  like, we can't shoot this, Michael.  And he's surrounded by too many yes people, and they went, are you going to say something? 
[02:56:00]  I'm not going to say anything.  It's Michael Jordan.  You say something.  Well, he's got the landing strip just below it.  Maybe we can pull it off.  Right.  Unbelievable.  And that mustache will never make a comeback.  Meanwhile, Charlie Chaplin and, uh, right?  Ollie?  Yeah, they both...  Oliver Hardy?  And they say that, like, Hitler actually got it from Chaplin.  Like, he was like, that's a fucking great mustache.  Well, didn't they?  They met and had a bit of a joke about who, before the war, cracked off.  I didn't know that.  They had a little moment where they were, like, he was in Germany doing a publicity thing 
[02:56:30]  for some film, and he met Hitler before he was Hitler-Hitler.  Wow.  Like, he was just the Fuhrer or whatever.  And they were like, oh, no, I had it first.  And they were all playful with each other.  Unbelievable.  Roland's outside with our sandwiches.  Remember yesterday?  I don't remember.  What a goddamn thing about this.  We're wrapping up everything.  Remember, he said five trays of sandwiches.  Well, there was some kind of sandwich thing being threatened.  So many sandwiches.  Bring in the Sambos.  Must-eat sandwiches.  Roland.  Yes.  I can't eat gluten. 
[02:57:00]  That's a lot of sandwiches.  That's a long callback.  That's all sandwiches?  We're looking at a box.  That's for the real listeners.  Fucking Defani's.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  We're looking at a box that would fit a mini fridge.  Since 1922, Defani's.  Or a dwarf child.  Even a further back part.  I like that.  That's nice.  A little callback.  We're all about to call back.  I know this guy.  Why do you have such a large box of sandwiches?  Because.  You've got to feed a lot of big guys.  We.  All right.  Let's crack it open.  Let's take a look.  These are the.  This is Brooklyn's most famous sandwich. 
[02:57:30]  Defante's.  Somebody told me you spoke about our potatoes and eggs one time.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did have that.  It was fantastic.  It's just a bucket of potato salad.  But how do they make it special?  Potatoes and eggs.  Well, it's on a sandwich.  All right.  90 years.  Yeah.  He figured it out.  The right recipe.  You mean how can they make it special?  Let's say.  No, I'm just saying.  How can you make a special steak?  How can you make a special?  I even love shitty potatoes and eggs.  There'd be seasoning involved.  All right.  Fair enough.  Now I got that fucking Heil Hitler song in my head.  Heil honey.  I'm home. 
[02:58:00]  Heil honey.  I thought Logan Sears was bad.  They managed to rhyme Heil and smile.  That I enjoyed.  Yeah.  Hey, Roland, what do you think of Linsanity last night?  It was a big bust.  He doesn't watch the games.  He just loves the t-shirts.  What have we got here?  What one?  I like a bit of roast beef.  That'll be my one.  You got that.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  You got a steak pizza.  I.O. special there.  What's that butter meat there?  No, it's fried eggplant.  Which one's the special one?  It's awesome.  I've had that.  I've had that.  Steak pizza.  I.O. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  It was just.  What do you got in there?  Saucers and peppers.  Yeah.  That's steak right there.  This looks like one of the roast beefs.  You want that up?  I don't know.  I'm going to take a look at it.  Is this going to be as good as Subway?  Because I have a pretty good bench bag.  Oh, my God.  It's used to fill.  They serve it in a foot long.  I'm not about taste.  I'm about size.  You're not really competing in that aspect.  So is my girlfriend.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Come on.  Zing.  Gert.  Hey, now.  Yes.  Is there any more water, baby, had? 
[02:59:00]  Forgotten more water.  Roland, you fucking stopped the floor of the show with your sandwich.  But they sound good, don't they?  At least tell me what you thought of Insanity last night.  Yeah, fuck you.  It was intense.  I saw two minutes.  But you have four shirts.  I know.  I had a headache.  I just saw two minutes.  It was a stressful two minutes?  Yeah, and I saw the Bethany Gay Married on Bravo.  What was that about?  She's coming back to her own talk show.  I don't know who this is.  Do you know Bethany Frankel from Real Housewives?  Yeah, she's from One of the Housewives. 
[02:59:30]  I never saw a Housewives.  Was she the New York one?  Yeah.  And then there's the spinoff?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can't imagine anyone who would want to be married to her.  Let's go back to the sound of the crinkling sandwiches.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  I'm going to try to make it work.  It's my job to at least try to make it work.  So much eggplant.  You're right.  I tip my hat to the commitment.  He's so fucking right.  But why wouldn't you watch Linsanity?  You're all about it.  You can only watch two minutes.  The game wasn't over after the first two minutes.  Couldn't you watch a little bit of him and then think you're full and then 20 minutes 
[03:00:00]  later want to watch him again?  See, that's one of the things that I don't want you to do.  You can't say that?  Yeah, you can't.  I thought that wasn't in the rules.  I thought I did very good there.  Is that joke already been done?  Technically, it hasn't been done yet.  Technically, it wasn't in the rules.  So he's right.  I thought I was finding a new bridge there, too.  There was a woman who had a sign the other night that said, I want you Linsanity.  Yeah.  Now that's at least creative.  Yeah.  And then she was literally pointing at her vagina in case there was anybody who didn't 
[03:00:30]  understand what she meant.  In case there's a doubt.  Is that the person who was on the TV show?  Yeah, it's Bethany.  But obviously not too far inside of me because you know the rumor.  Oh, see, that's again.  Now it's racist.  Yeah, it's a small penis.  They have a small penis because he's an Asian.  Well, I don't even know.  You know, the internet kind of proves that it's not a rumor.  We've all seen enough Asian porn.  I think I've been remarkably racist.  This is my most racist appearance on this show.  I don't know what it is.  You bring the best out of us there.  I feel it's like because Anthony's not here, I feel like I'm filling a void. 
[03:01:00]  You feel like you have to step up, right?  But somewhere he's on a cruise ship smiling to himself, just knowing that it's going on.  That he's being well represented?  Yeah.  So Del Fonte's, 1922.  Yep.  A lot of sandwich making.  Same guy's working there.  Are you in the family, as it were?  Yeah, I'm fourth generation.  Are you really?  Fourth generation.  So you're going to get a taste of that money?  I hope so.  You don't get it now, though, right?  No, not yet.  You've got to work my time a little bit.  Can I ask you, did you ever want to be something else?  If you're a fourth generation, did you ever turn up to your dad and go, 
[03:01:30]  I really, really want to work with puppets?  Like, have that awkward no, but like, are you happy to know that you'll always be working with sandwiches?  That you were locked in?  Could have been Senator DeFonte.  I never planned on working.  Governor DeFonte.  That's not what I wanted.  I never planned on working at the store.  I worked at.  We'll get there, Pop.  We'll get there.  My father never wanted me to be working at the store.  I wanted to make sure I finished college first and all that.  Did you finish college?  No.  I got kicked out.  Yeah, why would you finish college?  There's no sense.  You get the family business. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, exactly.  When you were two, you already realized I'm making sandwiches for a living.  Yeah.  I don't like that family business stuff.  You know, I got some of these guys that come in that they're interns and shit.  They're already $200,000 in debt.  No shit.  And like, well, I don't go, what do you want to do?  And they go, break in the radio.  I go, why don't you just do what I did?  Show up here.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There's no college for this.  No, not at all.  You just show up and hang around.  $200,000 before they get fucking in the door.  We've talked about the college thing. 
[03:02:30]  It's, I don't know.  Cream Pie Jones.  What's up with Cream Pie Jones?  Some people shouldn't go to college because they're just dumb cunts.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  It's like there's a lot of people going, oh, my kids are going to go to college.  Learn to fucking train, man.  The fact that in this country there's no one manufacturing shoes or anything because you're  all too good to clean houses or garden or anything.  Your lowest level retards are building cars.  I'd like a fairly intelligent person putting a car together for me.  Not just your lowest fucking the guy who can get a job anywhere. 
[03:03:00]  Anyway.  I'm happy to be in this country.  Sometimes it takes an outsider.  It really does.  It takes an outsider to shine the ugly light of America on us.  See this country through.  We've been in the fucking moon.  We got to the moon.  God damn it.  This isn't a routine.  I'm not doing a bid.  I just want to say.  It's just an observation.  Not everyone should go to school.  I agree with that.  Well, that part's for sure.  Yeah.  The idea that Americans love to have the piss taken out of us. 
[03:03:30]  That's questionable.  But also, what I will say about this, I don't think there's anything better than a family  business.  I mean, when people talk about the American dream, when I hear fourth generation and they're  all working the same place, I think that's the best thing you could have.  Well, what if this guy wants to go rogue?  You say, I don't want to make sandwiches.  I'm sure he has brothers.  What if you don't get along with your parents?  What if your mom's a bit of a cunt who ate too much chocolate and he didn't do his job?  A problem if you wanted to do something else?  Don't make it personal.  No, my father actually tells me all the time. 
[03:04:00]  He's like, listen, if this isn't for you, if you don't want to do it.  If you want to do tacos or something else.  Sushi.  You understand, dad.  He goes, are you one of those guys that are into raps?  Did I see you with a tortilla, you faggot?  Wow.  But now you're proud, right, to be a part of it?  Yeah, no, it's great.  And like I said, we've been getting nice publicity and people, you know, since we came into Manhattan,  everybody loves it.  That's great.  Yeah, you're lower in Manhattan, right? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, we're at Gramsley Park.  Right.  And out of Brooklyn originally.  Yeah, right.  But that's the first time that you guys have franchised out of Brooklyn all this time?  Yeah, early in the 80s they had one in Staten Island, but Staten Island wasn't developed  then, so it wasn't a good time.  I don't know.  Back in the 80s, the sandwich business, there was a lot of cocaine around.  I don't know anything about Staten Island.  That is just a weird foreign place.  Staten Island, I don't know anything about it.  Yeah, a lot of people, most people don't.  They don't know to dump.  That's what everybody says. 
[03:05:00]  It's very much like Jersey, except for they get to tell people they're from New York City.  There you go.  So it's like if they're like Jersey with a fucking highfalutin attitude.  I just drive through it between bridges.  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't know anything about it.  This is going nowhere.  No, I thought it was well.  It was terrific, right?  I loved it.  I'm going to put that on more and more.  I think I'm going to put that on my demo tape.  Sure.  I think Petey would appreciate that break.  Do me a favor and take some of the pieces that I had and put them on there.  All right, sure.  No problem.  You know, let me piggyback along here. 
[03:05:30]  This is going to last forever.  I got the Oscar show Sunday night.  And then who knows what I got next.  And that big announcement.  Yeah, the big announcement is coming up.  11.45.  Yes, 11.45.  We're going with 11.45 today.  I haven't slept yet because I flew in.  I'm going to have a nap.  Can someone Twitter it to me?  Yeah, we will.  When I wake up, the announcement's next to me.  Yeah, so the second you wake up.  Yeah, I want it on my screen.  Who's making this announcement?  I think Fez is going to make the announcement.  Do you know what it is?  Yeah.  He's going into the sandwich business. 
[03:06:00]  I know a couple of different things that it could be.  Oh.  Are you extremely happy with this news?  Huh?  Are you happy?  I'm happy with any news.  Okay.  So you don't ever...  You're saying you don't actually know what the news is?  I know what one of the announcements could be.  Ah.  I know...  Thank you very much.  Are you two breaking up?  That's, you know, that he has to sit around and, you know, he's coming to some kind of a  thought today.  But, you know, I don't want to fucking...  Is it going to be a disappointment?  Everything's a disappointment, isn't it?  The actual announcement, I mean. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Yeah, it's going to be such a letdown.  With this kind of a buildup?  Have you ever done anything with a buildup where the listeners went, fuck, thank you,  man.  No, no.  It's always...  You know what?  You promise less than you deliver.  Right.  This is fantastic.  Yeah.  Never happened.  Yeah.  Sort of like earlier when somebody said, can you do one impression talking to another?  Seriously, dude.  That was so fucking good.  I thought it was funny.  No, it was quite a letdown, I thought.  No, no.  Because it wasn't something I'd ever done before.  No.  I mean, in the act, I go back and forth between things, but not the thing I just mashed together. 
[03:07:00]  That was piss poor.  No, I loved it, though.  I did.  I enjoyed it, but now it's just gotten odd because it's like complimenting a child.  I was...  They let themselves down.  It's like, yeah, you played a good game.  I was having a Pacino morning, walking around.  I didn't even know which one this is.  The hotel.  And it's...  A beautiful day!  What happened?  He's either can't, and it's whispering, self-introspective, or screaming. 
[03:07:30]  There's no in-between anymore, right?  And he never did that, right?  For years.  Sent to the woman.  Sent to the woman, yeah.  He won the Oscar for Sent to the Woman, and it was off to the races.  We thought it was more devil's advocate.  That was after.  That's where he went completely over the top.  Oh, yeah.  There's a scene in the end when he's yelling,  It's my turn, Kevin!  You must have thought the director must have said,  Oh, Al, he's three feet away.  Right.  You know, I get it.  The devil's cranky.  But maybe you don't yell.  He can tear you.  Yeah, he didn't yell before, did he?  Not before.  He was very soft-spoken.  Sent to the woman. 
[03:08:00]  He won the Oscar for Sent to the Woman.  Hoo-ah!  One of America's greatest actors wins an Academy Award.  For doing, what is it, Chicken Hawk, right?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Is he nominated for Jack and Jill?  Did he get the nod?  No, he didn't.  He was the only person in that cast.  These Oscars are fucking bullshit, man.  The only person, yeah.  Loved War Horse.  I know, you cried.  Yeah.  But if you go back to, like, Panic!  And Needle Park, you can barely even hear him.  You had to fucking turn your TV up. 
[03:08:30]  Soft-spoken, yeah.  Dog Day got a little crazy, but not in that voice.  But he kept it under control.  Yeah, you're right.  Didn't he knock up Beverly D'Angelo?  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that a weird thing?  Twins.  Twins.  Yeah.  I liked looking at her feeders.  What's that?  Her young, her fucking...  Oh, you like Beverly D'Angelo?  Her fucking feeders, yeah.  I was at a dinner party with her once.  The first vacation movie, the boobies came out.  Oh, yeah.  I was at a dinner party at Frank Zappa's ex-wife's house. 
[03:09:00]  You get around?  Yeah, I live in L.A.  I do things.  You get around.  Your references get around, too.  Frank Zappa's ex-wife.  That's a different one.  Well, no, because Frank Zappa's dead.  Yeah.  It was Frank Zappa's house.  I think we're looking at Widow, maybe?  Or was it the ex, in fact?  Could have been his Widow?  No, Gail Zappa, who was his...  Widow.  Widow, yeah, his Widow.  I think ex is the wrong term.  Right.  Yes.  Like, a Widow is a form of ex.  Yeah, I guess it is, and we're no longer married. 
[03:09:30]  Yes and no.  Yeah, like, she's still not married to the guy.  Unless you're the person, I guess it wouldn't matter.  Only Italian women stay married after their husbands die.  I always love that when you see an Italian or a Greek woman who's, like, fucking wearing  the black for the rest of their life.  Yeah, like the funeral's still happening.  You miserable old cunt.  You know what I mean?  That you're going to wear black forever?  You're constantly in mourning?  You fucking drama queen.  Fuck, cheer up.  Wear a bit of yellow.  Fucking put it back out there. 
[03:10:00]  Mix it up a little bit.  Yeah, put your body back on the shelf.  There's her feeders, by the way.  Oh, lovely.  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't look too nice now, though.  Yeah, go to her for Montrage.  The beast.  Oh, really?  That's a little rough.  You know, it's a little rough.  She's a person.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, Jesus.  Hey, she looks all right to me.  Yeah, she's got that Botox chipmunk thing happening.  I love it.  You see a lot of that in LA?  That's all I'd go for now.  Obviously, Jim Jeffries.  I've become so immune to wrinkles and stuff.  If you don't look all plastic and, like, constantly shocked, I don't even want a piece of you. 
[03:10:30]  I like it when they've just had surgery, where they're a little bit puffed up.  That's when they're most attractive to you?  Yeah, I like it.  It's like after beating them, when they've just been allowed out of the house.  All right.  You know what?  Let's go to the phones.  The color's gone now.  Let's see if the listeners agree.  You've got a story.  Oh, we're so amusing.  Roland, the sandwich guy is standing there awkwardly.  You're not a good host.  He high-fived me when I said the beating the wife joke. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's Italian.  He's like, yeah, that's what we do.  It's the one thing me and my dad agree on.  We do want to thank DeFontes for the fine sandwiches.  Thank you so much.  You guys came through.  Roland said five trays.  We're like, there's no way he's bringing five trays.  There's 16 trays.  I'm seeing a lot of fucking trays.  What are you, that's sides over here?  There's some Caesar salad.  Sides?  What kind of sides?  A little potato salad?  You're going to have to set up a party.  Nice.  A macaroni salad.  You're going to have to invite Who Kid.  Oh, shit. 
[03:11:30]  Where's the Who Kid?  He's at the All-Star game.  Really?  Yeah.  For a serious exam?  No, he just goes down.  I mean, he's got parties and shit.  He's always got something booked.  Yeah.  We might wrap up, I guess.  Fuck, it's really 10 o'clock already?  Just about.  Jesus.  Hey, time goes fast.  What the fuck did that happen?  What?  You did an hour extra yesterday.  Yeah, I did.  Did you?  An hour extra?  Yeah, it's going in your time right now.  After I left, you were here another 45 minutes?  Yeah, I got it.  You got to be yesterday.  You had your cornered in.  You couldn't get out over there.  There was somebody blocking the...  That's what happened.  I made it to 11. 
[03:12:00]  Ronnie was able to escape.  No, I left.  Who were you in there?  I'm saying you were able to escape.  Sam.  Your name is on the channel, so it's not technically a punch card situation.  Oh, no.  I'm doing one hour less Monday.  He's going to come in at 7.  That's not a bad idea, Kevin Pollack.  He's going on the other side.  I'm glad someone's thinking around here.  Yeah.  I'll come home with Kevin.  He uses his whole name.  I noticed that.  You haven't done it with me.  Kevin Pollack.  Ron Bennington.  He does do that.  Because you're on.  He always calls me by my full name as well. 
[03:12:30]  Jim Jeffries?  Yeah, yeah.  He always calls me Jim Jeffries.  Depends on the guy, I guess.  Because I want to make sure you get the fucking plugs out.  No, I'm happy about that.  People are dumb out there.  They might be other gyms out there.  They might think that I'm...  I could take 10 phone calls.  I bet you half would go, Kevin, they wouldn't know.  Boy, Twitter exploded in terms of how great they thought the show was yesterday.  It's always nice when you hear from them.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I thank you.  Because I'm new to this scene.  And I'll tell you, I was a little intimidated that your fans would say, fuck this guy.  Get him.  Who do you think he is? 
[03:13:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  You've done 67 movies.  66.  I did another one while I was here.  Big in Buffalo 66.  He's up to 67.  I know.  He's done 76 movies.  It's amazing.  You know when the movie's going to be a dud as you're shooting?  No.  I mean, honestly, every time I've said yes, it was because the script made me laugh or made  me...  Right.  You know, there was something about it that grabbed me.  So you turned down things.  By the way, yeah, of course. 
[03:13:30]  But by the way, I love how this is the one profession that you're not allowed to work  for the money.  You know what I mean?  Right.  That's the crazy thing about being an actor.  Well, clearly he did that for the paycheck.  I'm sorry.  Nobody else worked for the paycheck?  Also, why did you make this piece of shit film?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're right.  It was all me.  I made the piece of shit film.  On top of which, what do you do for a living?  I work at a bakery.  Right.  So none of the donuts came out shitty ever?  They're all flawless?  Have you ever noticed in the same way that stand-up comics aren't allowed to do adverts? 
[03:14:00]  Every other fucking performing artist is allowed to do adverts.  But as soon as a stand-up comic does an advert, then they're a sellout.  Well, we all want to be sellouts, right?  What difference is it fucking like?  But you know who never even uses the word sellout is the rap guys.  Right.  They cannot wait to add more fucking products.  They just love it.  And they're like, what are you talking about sellout?  Of course something is sellout.  Of course.  One of my favorite moments on the show is when Michael Madsen, and it goes back to Kevin  Pollack's point, we put up his IMDB, and he explained why he did every movie. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, my God.  It was amazing.  And it was the first time I ever heard someone be honest about, yeah, I took that film because  I was way behind on my mortgage.  I took this film because I have an ex-wife I had to take care of, child support for this  one.  Oh, there's alimony.  Gambling fucking debts for this one.  There's alimony movies, that's for sure.  But he went through it.  But couldn't he have been one of the biggest movie stars of all time?  Absolutely.  What happened?  Maybe, you know, but I would say there's some of the choices after...  After a while, fuck's up, right? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  After a while, yeah.  No, the truth is you have to get consistently lucky.  You know?  It's not just a couple times lucky.  The Few Good Men was me being brought up to the majors.  Casino was being knighted by Scorsese to get an offer from Scorsese.  Crazy.  It doesn't get better than that.  Usual Suspects was lightning in a bottle.  A movie made for $5 million, starring nobody at the time, that exploded.  All this is fluky shit, so you have to keep getting lucky.  You know what I mean?  It's not enough to get lucky for a little period of time.  That is the kind of fucked up thing about a film career. 
[03:15:30]  You know, I'm a journeyman.  I'm a character actor, so I can kind of ebb and flow.  Nobody's buying tickets to come see me star in a movie, which is no pressure for me.  And, you know, the old saying was, as long as the leading man needed a best friend or  an attorney, I would continue to work.  You know what I mean?  I'm your guy.  The character actor gets to move around a little bit.  But the pressure of selling tickets...  Look at fucking Jim Carrey.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  Honestly.  And all these guys, by the way, that get to the top, they're all looking over their shoulder  for the next guy coming up.  But I've yet to see one of them sit and relax for five seconds. 
[03:16:00]  Why is it a lot of comedians want to do the serious roles?  Like someone like Jim Carrey can make a million funny movies.  Right.  For the next...  Because no one will say that's real talent.  You only get the talent for the serious.  Yeah, you'll never win an Oscar for a comedy film.  But I'm here to tell you, don't do the drama.  Stay with the comedy.  He's going to fuck you in the ass if you do the drama.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Tell you from Kevin.  He's been in 92 films.  Yeah, I know.  Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack.  People say thank you for that, by the way.  They appreciate I say the full name.  Oh, see that?  And you're just Ron, though. 
[03:16:30]  Everyone knows Ron and Fez.  How many people said that, though?  One or two.  Yeah, before you decide it's over.  I got validation.  Okay.  Ronnie B?  It only takes one person.  Give him the Ronnie B?  A little Ronnie B.  Is it a challenge for some of these comedians to say, you know what?  I could do the funny movies left and right.  I want to fucking challenge myself.  Well, we were talking yesterday about George Harrison wanting out of the Beatles and all these kind  of things.  You know, when you're in it, you have no idea what time is going to do to you.  So when you're in it, and everyone's giving you whatever the fuck you want, you need something  different.  Who the fuck doesn't need something different? 
[03:17:00]  Right.  You know?  I think Mike Myers would be a good guy to do a serious film.  I think he's got a quality about him that hasn't been explored on screen yet.  He's pretty good in the Studio 54 film.  Yeah.  Even he was still comical in that as well.  Right.  He was still wig and a thing and makeup and, hey, come in.  But, like, I want it, like, a proper, like, where he's playing like a normal guy.  There you go.  Well, it's not a bad request.  I put that out to you, Mike Myers, if you're listening.  Personal challenge.  If you're mad enough to do a serious job. 
[03:17:30]  Come down Sunday night and see the fight.  Fuck your cat in the hat.  It was shit.  He's listening through giant gold speakers right now.  What are they talking about?  Why are they picking on me?  Well, we've got to get Ron out of here.  Yeah, I've got to get going.  It was fun hanging out with you guys.  Great to see you.  I'm so excited about your Oscar show.  Yeah, let's make sure.  It should be really great.  Well, he's doing an Oscar show.  I understand.  Don't question it.  It's an annual thing, too, right?  He'll do talking, walking.  Don't you worry. 
[03:18:00]  He'll be back in New York.  What I really wanted, would you guys come on the chat show?  That's what I really wanted.  Definitely.  Right?  We're going to do that.  If it wasn't for the Oscars, we'd be there.  You've got to come on the chat show.  We'd be there.  Ron has left the studio.  Great to see you, Ron.  Thank you, Ron.  Take a sandwich, man.  The funny Calvary has left.  And we're out of here, man.  Jim Jefferies, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights?  Yeah, as I said, there's still tickets available for the late show this evening, but that's  all the tickets we have left this weekend.  All right.  And Kevin Pollard. 
[03:18:30]  A shit ton of tickets left to Caroline's if you want to call.  Come on.  Leave your house.  Actually, get out of the house and come out to Caroline's tonight.  Your stand-up's going like my movie career.  Yeah.  We're never satisfied.  None of this shit ever actually balances for a fucking minute.  And what am I doing?  I'm live tweeting this.  The Oscars.  I was asked to join, what is it again?  TweetRoast.com.  Yeah.  I think Ant's doing it.  Jim's doing it.  Bob Kelly's doing it.  A few of us are doing it.  And that's why I can't do your podcast. 
[03:19:00]  I understand.  But next time.  When are you going to be back in New York?  Sooner the better, I hope.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  Then we'll do it then.  Jim, thank you.  Kevin, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks to everybody else.  It was fun.  It was a fun week.  Have a good weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. </pre>
