<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a protracted sound-guessing game. The sound, eventually revealed to be a show staffer, Ben, snoring loudly in a D.C. hotel room, proved incredibly difficult for callers to identify, prompting numerous crude and humorous guesses and riffing from the hosts and callers.  The hosts provided increasingly unhelpful and absurd hints, consuming a significant portion of the show's runtime.

Iron Sheik then called in, discussing his wrestling career, his love for Madison Square Garden, and a recent ejection from an Atlantic City casino.  His distinctive speech and enthusiastic pronouncements punctuated the interview.

The show then shifted to Opie's severe sunburn, which became the target of numerous jokes from Opie, Anthony, and studio guest Paul Mercurio. This led to a discussion about the upcoming celebrity softball game, featuring a blind listener throwing the first pitch and anticipation of antics from comedian Tracy Morgan.  Dice played a poorly executed Who song, generating further comedic banter. Throughout these segments, the language was highly vulgar and sexually suggestive.

A lengthy, anecdotal story about the hosts' experiences with Tracy Morgan followed, filled with vulgar and sexually explicit content.  This transitioned into a discussion about anxieties associated with Long Island Railroad commutes, particularly racial anxieties and interactions with people of different backgrounds.  A prank call from Kreskin, predicting a massive UFO sighting in Nevada, was discussed and subsequently debunked by a caller who identified the sighting as the International Space Station and other satellites.  The segment concluded with a painful staple-gun contest between Opie and Anthony, using newspapers as padding on their thighs.  Anthony ultimately conceded due to pain and bleeding.  A studio guest, possibly a friend involved in the celebrity softball game, was briefly mentioned, along with FoundryMusic.com.

The staple-gun challenge continued, with Anthony's increasing pain and reluctance contrasted with Opie's taunting and bets placed on the outcome.  Anthony's leg became visibly injured and bleeding.

A heated call with a woman named Irene followed.  Irene criticized the show's content, particularly its perceived biased degradation of certain ethnic groups and its focus on "soft porn."  The conversation escalated into a vulgar exchange. Irene revealed her boyfriend had recently died of a heart attack, further inflaming the argument.  The hosts eventually hung up on Irene after a prolonged and contentious exchange. Studio guest Paul Mercurio was present, and the show briefly mentioned the death of Maureen Reagan before a prank call impersonating Ronald Reagan was conducted.  The impersonator made numerous offensive and inappropriate statements about his family members, including Maureen.

[00:17:00]  And get about three or four hours of sleep  Yeah  Yeah  Definitely  Wow  Dead out  That's what it was  That's like  We were out Wednesday night  To like three in the morning  Thursday night to three in the morning  Friday night  Whenever we got back  And then I just passed out  And I'm dead  That is just a sick sound though  It doesn't sound like a snore  No  And Stinky  You're yelling and screaming  And saying  Wake the F up  Put it this way  It was so great  Like one week we had like a crazy week  I don't know what it was  Way back  We had like a couple events that week  And up at my ski house  I got my own 
[00:17:30]  Our ski house was like 30 people  And we had had a crazy week like that  And I had already done a sleep all week  I cleared out my whole wing of the ski house  Really  I had my own room in the ski house  No one else around  But yeah  If I go  If I have a week with not a lot of sleep  That's what  What does that have to do with  Being tuckered out  Have to do with sounding like a seal  Being totally raked  I have no idea  Clubs  Yeah  Listen again  This is Ben snoring in D.C.  You couldn't even wake me up 
[00:18:00]  I was out  Ben shut up  Shut up  I was like hitting my bed  I was getting up  How loud  Yell how loud  You told him to shut up  I was like  Ben  Shut the F up  I just wouldn't wake up  I got so  It was an hour and a half  And I was so pissed and tired  You know what's great about this  I'll get my own room on the next trip  Because none of you guys want to stay with me  I mean 
[00:18:30]  But Stinky  Did he wake up in the middle of the night  And start giggling to himself  No  That's the best  Because I used to crash at Ben's place  In the city  When we first moved back to New York  And we'd have the late  You know  Appearances and stuff  And I would just crash  You know  It was cool to hang out with Ben and stuff  And he would have this type of snoring going on  But then  He would throw in a few laughs and giggles  In the middle of the night as well  Oh  He was finding something funny in his sleep  And he would just openly laugh and giggle  Why would you laugh?  Ben  Were you dreaming about being tickled? 
[00:19:00]  That's pretty funny  Now the sounds of Baby Seal being beaten  That's the worst noise I've ever heard  That's pretty bad  Imagine being five feet away from that sound for a minute  It had to be really loud too, right? 
[00:19:30]  I went to the bathroom  And I was like  Maybe I could sleep in the bath tub or something  Oh my god  And we had a balcony  I went out in the balcony  I closed the glass  Sliding glass door  Still here  I thought people next door were going to complain  Oh my god  And finally I threw a pillow on his face  And he was snoring through the pillow  Put his head back up on the pillow  And finally shifted  And stopped  Ben you asked up everyone's wire taps at the water game  Yeah  I couldn't get anything done  What's this sound? 
[00:20:00]  It's the commie code  Well that's classic  Very good  Snoring brings out such a rage  When you're in the room with someone  I rebunked with Voss years ago  He does that  He's awful  Just that awful  Awful apnea  And you just want to stick a knife in them  It's like the mother effer would just  Stop  The ones that go  Voss is the worst  How about the ones that pause to the point 
[00:20:30]  You think they're dead or dead?  I'm hoping  They don't keep you awake anymore  And then they let it go  You know what's funny?  You remember the guy on the train back  On the train back  That was sitting next to us  That was snoring up a storm  On the way back  On Saturday  Was he snoring?

[00:22:00]  Let's take a break  We'll be back  omdat  Libby mo's  The O-O-B-W-E-W  The O-P-E-A-N-E-Show  They say I'm cocky  And I say  One egg bragging  If you do it  And you back it up  They say I'm cocky  ещё  COCKY  And I say  One egg bragging  You ain't bragging if you do it, then you back it up. 
[00:22:30]  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  On our hotline, Anthony, the Iron Sheet.  Ah, pleasure for me.  He had a little trouble, I guess.  We spoke to a guy that works at a casino down in Atlantic City  and said that the Iron Sheet was getting a little intoxicated and boisterous  and had to be removed from the casino.  Well, we always give equal time here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, right now, the Iron Sheet. 
[00:23:00]  Iron Sheet, how are you doing?  Fine, thank you, Sir Rick. How are you?  What a good Iron Sheet.  It's a pleasure for me to talk to you, Iron Sheet.  God bless you, first of all.  Do you think about the real champion from all this country in the world,  Peresha or Iran.  I made it to the most famous city in the world,  Madison Square Garden, New York,  and a single tag team.  And I, God bless you, call me.  And I want to also say thank you to the last time that Javroni, 
[00:23:30]  my agents, Steve Chaplin, bring me over there.  And with Eric Simpson, I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends.  God bless you, you, you, you.  Think about me and call me, Rick.  Talk to me.  Wow.  It's a pleasure for us, Iron Sheet.  Pleasure for us, Iron Sheet.  You're live on the radio with Opie and Anthony, of course.  And we heard that you had some problem in a casino last night.  Well, in the casino, people come in. 
[00:24:00]  There was autographed, and then there was too many people.  And we were in the street with Steve Chaplin,  and there were road crows,  and then a thousand, thousand people were,  and the officers said,  No, Sheik, you have to go.  You cannot.  The Manhattan street was closed.  Uh-huh.  Yes, sir.  And all my wrestling friends recognized the real Iron Sheet,  Khosrow Vaziri, from Iran, Tehran, and Shah Ahmad Rezaim. 
[00:24:30]  I want to say, Rick, God bless you.  Think about me.  I'm training 90 degrees.  I'm going to come to the Manhattan.  I hope pretty soon.  And what was that place you played here in Manhattan?  Well, I go to the Broadway and my company,  the World Wrestling Federation, WWF restaurant.  Right.  And usually all my wrestling friends come over, 
[00:25:00]  and I send a picture for them, make them happy,  because my boss, Mr. McMahon,  greatest boss, and God bless his father,  and his son, and Shane, and all his daughter,  all intelligent people.  I want to say hello to everybody.  God bless you.  Think about me.  Iron Sheik, what was the big arena that you played in New York City?  Well, the biggest arena,  the most famous arena, Madison Square Garden, New York, 
[00:25:30]  number one arena, number one Bosco in the world,  the most famous arena in the world is Madison Square Garden, New York,  24-hour city.  Yes, 24-hour city, New York.  Hey, didn't you fight the Hulk once?  Yes, sir.  I beat Mr. Bob Buckland six years.  Nobody beat him.  I included my best friend, Mr. Bruno Sammartino. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, where are you?  None of them beat him.  I beat him, and then I didn't feel good.  I lost my belt to that jabroni Hulk Hogan,  and Madison Square Garden, New York.  But didn't you eventually beat Hulk Hogan?  Yes, sir.  I can beat him even right now.  Hulk Hogan is a guitar player.  He's not an Olympic wrestler.  He's not an AAU wrestler.  He's never been any competing in the Overseer Olympics.  He's an Olympic showman and a bodybuilder, 
[00:26:30]  and he used the gimmick A to the Z himself,  and he told the kids or nobody else to do it.  Yeah, I beat the jabroni in 85,  and I still can't beat him too.  Yes, sir, Rick.  I'm ready.  Now, if you were to get a fight with Hulk Hogan here in New York,  where would be the best place to do that  so the most people could see it?  The most famous sereno in the world.  Madison Square Garden, New York.  And I think he's in the heart of Manhattan. 
[00:27:00]  And if any jabroni doesn't know about Madison Square Garden, New York,  that means something wrong with his brain.  Right. Absolutely. Absolutely.  We're really not familiar with that room, Iron Sheik.  I'm sorry, sir. Again, sir?  We're not really familiar with that room.  What room?  That garden room.  Oh, but I'll be honest with you, sir.  I born in Tehran, Iran, the most oldest city in the world. 
[00:27:30]  And all my brother was a wrestler.  Yes.  Like when I was a taxi, Habib, Zandi.  Gregor Romero.  Gregor Romero.  I don't want to keep you too long, Rickdon.  Rickdon and solve my intelligence, Baba.  I'm the real champion.  Not that you're running Hulk Hogan.  Right.  I'm his company.  And I'm going to ask up to you.  They'll tell you, Baba.  Right.  Hallelujah.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends in the most famous city in the world. 
[00:28:00]  Madison, Sierra Garden, Manhattan, New York, Long Island, all my students, especially Long Island.  I want to say hello to all of them.  God bless them.  And on the next couple of weeks, I hope my agents, Steve Chapman or the Jebroni, Eric Sims,  maybe they invite me again.  Always pleasure for me.  Always pleasure.  And God bless you guys.  Think about it.  Pleasure for us, Iron Sheet.  Hey, Iron Sheet, you ever meet Tippi Tom behind a dumpster?  I'm not good for a joke, Baba.  Nikola, my partner, he like the rib and joke. 
[00:28:30]  I'm not joking.  I'm a real Olympic gold medal for toughest sport in the world.  Freestyle and Gregor Romero.  And not Michael Jordan, or not football, Joe Naiman.  I'm the individual Olympic gold medal.  Iron Sheet, Nikolai Volkov, he fought, what's it, Sergeant Slaughter here in New York.  I can't remember where that was, though.  Oh, well, usually Sergeant, I mean, Nikola, myself, Tatti, with the greatest manager in 
[00:29:00]  the world, Mr. Harvard Fingo, no, and Mr. Fred Blassie was my manager, Nikola.  And I, we beat that all American boys, they call him born USA, Mr. Mark Rotondo and Mr.  Barry Windham.  I remember I saw that Nikolai Volkov and Sergeant Slaughter about, but I can't remember where  that was here in New York.  Well, Rick, you should be intelligent, Baba.  And a soldier, myself, the most, the most famous match was a Cambod match. 
[00:29:30]  Madison Sturgaard of New York.  And a soldier and I, they call it Cambod, Cambod match.  That was one of the most wrestling history, that match.  Yes.  I remember that.  That was famous.  The memory of a goldfish.  Yeah, Iron Sheik, pleasure for us, Iron Sheik, to speak it to you. 
[00:30:00]  Number one wrestler, Greco-Roman, from oldest country, Iran, Tehran, a wonderful pleasure.  Yeah, Fred and Greco-Roman.  And Greco-Roman.  And Greco-Roman's Palace, WWF, single, casting with Nikola and Badr Roller.  God bless Mr. McMahon, didn't forget about his real champ when I was there.  I'm happy. God bless you guys called me.  Always a pleasure to talk to you guys, Rick.  Very pleasure.  And say hello to my Pazan Anthony and also Opie. 
[00:30:30]  Right, and pleasure for us, Iron Sheik.  God bless you.  All right. Any final thoughts, Iron Sheik?  I'm sorry, sir?  Any final thoughts before we let you go?  Fight?  Now, any final thoughts, any other thing you want to say before we let you go, Iron Sheik?  If you don't mind, I want to say hello quick to all my Muslim and Iranian brother Farsi.  Hello.  Just a couple seconds if you don't mind.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay, assalamualaikum, خدمته. 
[00:31:00]  Hemheye şenomundگan ایرانی عزیز که در نیویورک و نیویجرزی زندگی می کنن.  Salam از می کنن.  محبقیت شما رو آرزی می کنن.  خسرو وزیری، احرامان ایران و احمد رضایی می دونه محبوب آدی.  Ya Allah, Ya Muhammad, Ya Ali.  And also I want to say hello to my good friends Sonny Beach and Greg and also Big Bob.  And I hope pretty soon I'm going to come to Manhattan again. 
[00:31:30]  Hello?  Very good.  Thank you so much, Iron Sheik.  Pleasure for us.  God bless you.  Thank you again.  Anytime, no problem, sir.  And maybe we'll see you here in New York in the biggest arena ever.  In the world, Madison Square Garden.  If any jabroni doesn't know about Madison Square Garden, New York, the most famous arena in the world,  something wrong with that jabroni brand.  Because if Iron Sheik can make it, you can make it too. 
[00:32:00]  But you have to want it.  You have to turn in.  You have to really think in about that gold medal.  Ya Allah, Ya Muhammad.  And my brother Muhammad Ali know, and Joe Fraser know,  and the most famous actor in the world for boxing,  my brother Muhammad Ali, the greatest,  and for wrestling the Iron Sheik.

[00:32:30]  God bless you, sir.  Thank you.  Good night.  Are we Iron Sheik?  Yes, sir.  You've got the Iron Sheik.  You had a killer line.  He has a memory like a gold medal.  So, Obie, did he get kicked out of that casino?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Like we were going to get an answer to that one.  Gearing up to be a fun one, kids.  Gearing up to be another cluster F.  Your pals, Obie and Anthony.  Gearing up to be another cluster F. 
[00:33:00]  Numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:33:30]  Hey!  Put your goddamn clothes back on tonight.  Hey, put your goddamn...  Hey, Norton, how are you, brother?  A lot of people want to know if you'll be warming up the crowd before the game tomorrow.  I will.  If there are any old women, they're going to get punched in the face  if they don't applaud when I get up to the plate.  Who's playing?  What's the matter with your face?  Why are you so red, Lobster Boy?  I got...  Lobster Boy.  I got sunburned.  What is wrong with you?  I went out.  Paul, we said it earlier.  I went to the beach, and what happened?  See, I was only half of this. 
[00:34:00]  The sun was the other half, and it burned me.  Paul, do you agree with me?  We went over this to start the show today.  Doesn't he make you uncomfortable?  It is.  It's like a white trash guy mowing the lawn all day.  You're from Long Island, the East Coast.  How do you not put on...  Why didn't you get the bullhorn and go,  excuse me, I need a little help here.  You're half of this.  I need suntan lotion.  Now, when Anthony comes out and hits the beach,  I want everybody to just slather him with suntan lotion.  Beware. 
[00:34:30]  Don't insult him.  He's not wearing a sweater.  That's his back hair.  I don't have back hair.  No, it's all been burned off by the rays of the sun.  Never had back hair.  What did you do, a lance bass and get aboard the shuttle  and go around the surface of the sun and get a pin?  I was at the beach yesterday.  By the way, was there any underwater fighting going on at the beach?  No, that's Opie.  I know.  It was very overcast.  What?  It was very foggy. 
[00:35:00]  You couldn't see...  Put your goddamn suntan lotion on.  Look at his pores.  They're just sweating.  It doesn't hurt.  It's very red.  It's not a suntan.  You have some kind of a disease emanating from your crotch, from your junk.  No, it's very red, but it doesn't hurt.  It's really shiny.  Your eyelids are burnt.  What were you doing?  You went to like a third-rate crappy suntanning place down in the alphabet city. 
[00:35:30]  You know how red you are?  You should be crying in front of a pile of garbage.  Oh, stop.  You look like you...  You look like the people...  I knew that would go nowhere.  I remember that.  That's the Indian guy.  Very good.  You look like you took a tour of Williamsburg and forgot to put the suntan lotion.  You're that person.  I couldn't realize.  Show me where the tan stops, where the socks were.  Show me where that is.  Roll up your sleeve.  I saw that earlier today.  Oh, my God.  It's going to take a while.  You are your father, man. 
[00:36:00]  Look.  Did you tell kids to get off your lawn while you were there?  Get off the lawn.  Your goddamn kids.  No, it was very overcast.  What are you talking?  Why did you take your shirt off?  Because it wasn't hot.  It was down at the water.  It was, like, breezy.  I was just hanging out.  How'd you do, by the way, finding coins in the sand?  Do you do well?  I wasn't looking.  Beep, beep, beep.  How many seagulls are you in an argument with this time? 
[00:36:30]  No.  You know, I'll admit, I effed up.  I effed up.  I underestimated the nuclear furnace that is our sun.  He goes, after, like, three hours of being in the sun, he looks at himself, and he goes,  Ooh, I'm getting a little red.  I better put something on.  Everyone has been in that position.  At that point, it's way too late.  Was it the sizzling that tipped you off?  Yeah, the grilling.  Wait, I bet you had one of those, like, those foil blankets that you buy on late-night television. 
[00:37:00]  No, I didn't have a foil blanket.  One of those oval ones, because oval ones do better in terms of even tanning.  I think I have the big question.  I have the big question.  What?  And you never go to the beach.  Why did you go yesterday?  Because it was out at Watch Hill.  I just went.  Oh, you went out to Watch Hill.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  I'm fine.  Are you went to Watch Hill in Rhode Island?  No, Long Island.  It's a nice spot.  It's kind of...  All right, anyway.  I went to the beach.  He's inexperienced with the beach.  So, Paul Mercurio in the studio. 
[00:37:30]  Did you bring a sandwich wrapped in cellophane to keep it out of the sun?  You know, he...  Did your tuna soak into the Wonder Bread?  Yeah.  That's what happened.  You're such a geek.  It was...  It was something...  You know something?  I wasn't on the air.  So, I had something to do.  Your face is so red.  You have to tell us how bad it hurts.  Yeah.  You see him on the beach with socks on?  Just what an ass ant looks like at the beach.  I know.  With the shirt, the socks, the sneakers in the water.  Let me guess.  You got a pair of old jeans, cut them off, went crazy. 
[00:38:00]  I did not go the cutoff...  How long did you work on the fray?  I did not go the cutoff...  Did you bedazzle a jacket and walk around?  I did not go that route.  Did you have shorts on?  Wow.  Huh?  You know, I was a little tired today.  I wasn't sure I was going to have anything in the old gun there, but I'm doing all right  so far.  You're doing pretty good there, Paul.  Did you have shorts on?  No, it was cold.  It wasn't hot.  So, you have a tan on your forearms and your face, and that's it?  That's it.  You wore long pants to the beach?  Were you...  Are you collecting garbage on the side on the beach?  No.  Is that it? 
[00:38:30]  I was just hanging out.  Did you give you those short-sleeved one piece?  Were you whacking your bag behind a dune looking at people?  You're a weirdo.  All right, look.  Because if you're wearing pants at the beach, you must be whacking your bag looking at people.  I'll bet you just the helmet is burnt.  Some finger marks.  Some little marks in between the fingers.  Did you put a little visor on your helmet about halfway through?  Well, I'm sure there was white stuff.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  You know, I hope you all have fun at my expense and my sunburn.  What's next?  Planning on skiing in January with a Speedo on?  It's...  It will go away very quickly.  Don't worry.  It's like you went to Central Casting and said,  Make me up to look like the whitest man who's never seen the sun before.  It's like they literally lifted your hair and they put makeup around.  Yeah.  And they worked it in.  It's like if you went to the bathroom and washed off, it would just all...  Yeah.  If only it were that easy that I could do that and be out of this barrel right now. 
[00:39:30]  I would wash and wash and wash.  It's like the devil from Willow.  Hold on.  Charlie wants to say something.  Charlie, what's up?  How you doing, Owen?  Hey.  All right.  Hey, the big yellow one's the dark.  Ah, you ass.  The big red one is Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Now I tell you, I got a sunburn.  Are you going to be able to play tomorrow with that burn? 
[00:40:00]  We're going to have to spot you a couple of balls or something?  I don't think that'll be your concern because you're not going to be on my team.  Oh.  Jeez.  It puts the lotion on its skin.  We have a blind guy because Tom from New Orleans can't make it.  Yeah.  Why?  He's going to be drunk.  Blind Dave.  Exactly.  Blind Dave's going to start in center field and he's got to make his way to the mound  with our listeners pretty much directing him. 
[00:40:30]  When he gets to the mound, then he'll throw out the first pitch for the game tomorrow.  That's brilliant.  Just don't hit Anthony in the face.  I don't want to hear him.  Right.  Ow.  Ow.  My thumb burned.  That makeup will rub off on the ball and there'll be a big red spot on the ball.  Here's Anthony rounding first into second.  Oh, I can't slide.  No, he can slide.  He wore the long pants.  Just not on my arms.  Right.  Yeah.  By the way, that's a good question.  What are you going to wear tomorrow?  A fur coat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear it's supposed to be a little chilly.  You're all red, though.  You look like one of Joel Steinberg's children. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  Wow.  A Steinberg reference.  You weren't getting enough attention today.  You had to do that, right?  I had to do that.  17 cities did not get that.  That's okay, but the one that did, I was laughing pretty hard.  Mama Sheen looked at my sunburner and goes, you look like a dog, D.  Hooray.  Thanks.  Funny as...  You asses.  Are you going to be the next model for Coppertone?  You know something.  With a little dog pulling at your swim trunks?  I want them hung up by their Buster Browns. 
[00:41:30]  Jaws, idiot.  Jesus.  Sorry, I didn't get a 1975 reference immediately.  I'm kidding.  Love you, Hope.  Love you, Rick.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Let me lick that off.  7-W-N-E-W.  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up.  And long ago somebody left with the cup. 
[00:42:00]  But he's driving and driving and hugging the turn.  I'm thinking of someone for who he still burns.  He's going to distance.  He's going to speed.  She's all alone in no time of need.  Because he's racing and racing and parting the course.  He's fighting and fighting and running on his horse.  He's going to distance. 
[00:42:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  God, whose summer North American tour will continue on despite the death yesterday of founding bassist John Entwistle?  They will?  Yeah, they're going to go.  Who are they going to get?  According to a note posted on Guitars, Pete Townsend's official website.  That's carrying.  Pete and Roger have decided that the tour will carry on.  As a tribute.  God, if I see either one of those two on TV going, 
[00:43:00]  The show must go on.  It's what John would have wanted.  Shut up.  I hate that.  You know what this is a story about?  It's John money.  It's what John would have wanted.  It's what John would have wanted money, especially since the tour was starting today.  It was supposed to start.  You know how much money has been poured into this already?  You can't just pull out.  You can't just leave.  There are commitments that are made.  Money has already been spent on a stage, on venues.  You can't then just pull out.  You've got to pay for this stuff. 
[00:43:30]  Someone's going to take a bath.  Bass player Pino Palladino has been drafted in for the shows.  Hey, Pino Palladino.  Palladino.  I played him back in 82 in a movie.  Pino Palladino.  And Dice, maybe you can play bass for the hook.  I could do that.  I know you like the drums, and I know you like your rock and roll.  It's all rhythm.  I got it.  Rhythm on the drums, the bass, banging my wife.  Oh!  Pino Palladino?  Who? 
[00:44:00]  Palladino.  Oh, where did he come from?  Someone will know who he is.  I don't.  The Las Vegas and urban shows will be rescheduled for new dates, Anthony.  Pino Palladino, studio bass player.  Played in the 80s with Don Henley.  Oof.  Records, and recently played with Richard Ashcroft from The Verve.  Okay.  There you go.  Pino Palladino.  Good date for him.  Good for you, then.  Good for you, then.  I could have played.  Ever since I was a young boy, I played something with the balls. 
[00:44:30]  Talking about my g-g-g-g-g-generation.  People try to put me down.  G-g-g-generation.  I won't get fooled again.  No.  Yeah, look, I'm playing the bass.  Hey, people try to put me down.  Talking about my generation.  Just because my pants are down. 
[00:45:00]  Oh!  Talking about my generation.  They seem awful dead or no.  Cold.  My generation.  I hope I don't die before I get old.  Too late.  Oh!  My generation.  My generation, Kenny.  My generation, baby.  All right, you're so handsome, playin' that.  Baby.  My generation.  Don't try to hit me with things that are gay.  Oh!  I'm trying to call some pigs. 
[00:45:30]  Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say 
[00:46:00]  Ballad at the beginning.  Then it starts rocking.  Bring it down a little bit.  Okay, here I go.  All right.  Nice windmill.  Nice.  And since I was the young dice, I played with the bulls.  Yeah, I must have played with them all. 
[00:46:30]  No.  That dust-dumb-and-blind kid is a stupid bastard who should be shot.  At least he ain't a midget.  He's standing like a statue.  He must be retarded.  He's feeling the bumpers.  He's playing good, but he's an idiot.  That dust-dumb-and-blind kid.  I could bend over and bang him, and he can't identify me. 
[00:47:00]  Because he's retarded.  I have my own thing to the who.  But now it's mine.  If you can go on tour with the who, you've got to learn the words to the song.  No, they learn me.  I like this one.  It's a long intro, bro.  It certainly is.  Yeah, huh?  Let's go get a sandwich.  Then we'll start the bit in three minutes.  He-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge. 
[00:47:30]  All right, I forgot.  I thought I lost this.  Oh, the magic bus.  I don't know this one too well.  The magic bus.  Meet the new boss.  Same as the old boss.  Almost like the boss from yesterday is the same boss as the boss today. 
[00:48:00]  You hear?  I hear me.  Yeah.  Tommy, can you hear me?  I hear ya.  Can you feel me near you?  Tommy, can you see me?  Oh!  Hey, hey, hey, Tommy. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, Tommy, you stupid ass.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy, can you hear me?  You hear me?  I hear ya.  Can you feel me near you?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy, can you see me?  Open your eyes, jackass.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy. 
[00:49:00]  Tommy.  Tommy.  Can you hear me?  Can you feel me near you?  Hey, Tommy.  Tommy.  Can you see me?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Can I help to hear you?  Ooh.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy. 
[00:49:30]  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  He's already in.  It's so stupid, it's funny.  You're here?  I hear me.  Oh, this is a fun song.  Mama's got a squeeze box.  She wears on her chest. 
[00:50:00]  When Daddy comes home, he don't get no rest.  Because she's f***ing it all night.  All night long.  And the f***'s all right.  And she's f***ing it.  Look.  Daddy don't sleep at night.  Because she's banging it.  Oh.  The kids don't sleep.  The dog can't eat.  There's no escape in the music.  In the whole f***ing street. 
[00:50:30]  He's f***ing it all night.  Oh.  Mama's got a big f***.  Daddy never sleeps at night.  Why?  Why don't he sleep?  Because she's f***ing that big fat.  Loud and in and out.  And he's f***ing it all night long.  And he sprays banana juice.  And it's all right. 
[00:51:00]  Mama's got a fat f***.  Daddy f***s it all night.  Ow.  Oh.  It goes in and out.  And it all night long.  With that horse.  Come on and f*** me.  Come on and f*** me in me.  Oh.  Hey.  I'll flip her over.  I don't care.  I hope so.  Mama's got a stinky f***. 
[00:51:30]  Daddy never sleeps at night.  It goes in and out.  Until I make a mess.  Play the banjo, you retard.  Play the f***ing banjo, you f***et.  Oh.  Look, I'm dancing.  I'm doing line dancing.  I'm boot scooting.  She goes in and out.  And in and out. 
[00:52:00]  My big fat f*** goes in and out of this mess.  I'm playing all night.  And the f*** ain't tied no more.  Mama's got a stinky f***.  Daddy never sleeps at night.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Fabulous.  Thank you, Dice.  What?  Oh, he's got more?  Ain't this a long intro, too?  By the way, is anyone enjoying this intro? 
[00:52:30]  This is great.  Yeah, man.  You know, it's...  You don't like this?  No.  For ten seconds, yeah.  For four minutes, no.  It's a big, nice, long, new intro.  Out here in the fields,  a man has to fight for his meals.  You hear me?  I hear me.  I get my f*** into a f***y.  I don't need to fight. 
[00:53:00]  You hear?  To prove I'm right.  Right, Kenny?  Right, handsome.  I don't need to be forgiven.  I don't care.  When men were oysters,  they fought for their meals.  Back like the days  when they fought tigers  for the meat in the jungle.  You hear?  I hear me.  It's Teenage Wasteland. 
[00:53:30]  This song is conducive to the dice, man.  It was so good.  Yo.  I like that.  Hey, maybe you can play  You Better You Than You.  Shut up.  We're not talking about music today.  You better, you better.  You better.  You better.  You better.  You better.  Bosco, you better.  You better.  Hey, now here's a surprise, honey. 
[00:54:00]  I know that you have.  Because there's f*** me in your eyes.  I can see you in your eyes.  I can see you in your eyes.  For miles.  And miles.  My c*** goes on for miles.  And miles.  And miles.  Uh, yeah.  If you think that I do.  That I don't know about the little tricks you play, 
[00:54:30]  you f***ing whore.  And never see you in your eyes.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, here's a joke, can't you?  You're going to choke on my c***.  You just smile.  Because all the while,  your c*** goes on for miles and miles,  you c*** out old bitch.  Miles and miles.  Oh!  Your c*** goes for miles and miles and miles. 
[00:55:00]  Miles and miles.  Miles is smelly c***.  Dicephania.  Dicephania.  Dicephania.  Am I a mod?  What am I?  I'm a punk, a mod.  Tim, you all right?  Yeah, I'm just enjoying.  No, you're not.  We're laughing here, 
[00:55:30]  and you're just kind of staring at us.  I'm listening to you and enjoying.  I'm putting on an album,  Dicephania live at Budokan.  Reginald.  All right.  Now the Wow Ropey and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Brewer's around here somewhere.  The MVP of my team Saturday was Jim Brewer. 
[00:56:00]  Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  Duh.  I thought you were going to announce it.  But it was Brewer.  Yeah, he went four for four, scored four runs, two RBIs, and he was flawless at first base.  Except for the Big Kev play, I think.  Yeah, that's true.  By the way, the video of Big Kev, and he's monstrous, is up on foundrymusic.com as he's trying to run out of play to first.  Unbelievable. 
[00:56:30]  When he hits the ground.  When he falls off, the slow motion shot is the best.  They show it in full speed.  And then slow motion, Big Kev, just plowing into first base.  He hits, and you just see his legs flop up as his momentum pushes him toward the baseline.  Yeah.  So go to foundrymusic.com.  We're adding pictures and video clips every day.  Oh, yeah.  Because there's so much stuff to go through. 
[00:57:00]  Our listeners are sending stuff in every day.  We're going through it and trying to put the best stuff up there.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  There he is, MVP, baby, Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  And you're dressing the part now with the sunglasses.  Look at you.  I'm cocky now.  Dude, I've been reliving that day.  In real?  That's going to be a stinger.  It was awesome.  The reality, though.  He's got up, he's out! 
[00:57:30]  The reality is, though, no one saw the game.  I know, man!  Oh, no.  I was praying there was, like, one real guy sitting there going,  Brew is a good player.  Please.  No, but he was going, look at them cans.  You know how many people called us on Monday and said,  all right, I was at the game.  You just got to tell me who won, because I don't know.  Yeah, people that were at the game.  Someone said no one stopped, no one watched it after the third inning.  I was like, dude, empty your brother's.  And there were no one watching by then.  I know. 
[00:58:00]  Take your shirt off!  You take your shirt off!  He's absolutely right.  You'd hear, like, you'd hear cheers and think that it's for the game,  something that's going on in the game,  and then, no, you realize no one's even looking.  I got a hint, drilled one.  I was all excited.  I thought they were saying, brew up, brew up, turn around.  It's like, who were, who were, who were?  Don't show the...  Don't watch that language.  Don't show the, you know, the apples. 
[00:58:30]  The apples, the...  No wonder, you know, SNL let you go with that potty mouth on live TV.  Bro, can I tell you something?  What?  You've been telling me for years, or a few years now,  Tracy Morgan is off the hook.  Isn't he crazy?  He is so...  Tracy Morgan is off the hook.  Isn't he crazy?  He is so...  He's out of his mind.  I don't know what SNL's doing.  I know he's got a couple characters...  Thank you.  ...that are doing really well.  Brian Fellow.  We used to be in the same room.  Fellow and the homeless guy that lives in the sewer.  But I'm telling you, man, they're not using him for his full potential. 
[00:59:00]  The guy is beyond funny.  Beyond funny.  Just like yourself.  Yo, Jimmy, yo, Jimmy raging against the machine, yo.  You know when they be taking your donkey, be jerking, yo.  And your toes be all up and off.  Yo, Opie, is all that.  I'm Brian Fellow.  Look at that.  Hey, you've got to be doing the...  Who's coming down to Apollo?  Did you...  Were you in the locker room when he was inviting all the white people?  All you white people who have never had nappy dugout. 
[00:59:30]  Nappy dugout.  He was inviting all the white guys to go to Harlem to get banged by young black girls.  He used to try to hook me up.  It was hilarious.  He's like, make sure your permission slips are signed by your parents.  I live in the Bronx.  I live in the Bronx.  I live in the Bronx.  I live in the Bronx.  I live in the Bronx at the door.  We're going up to Harlem for some of that skanky, nappy dugout.  I live in the Bronx because I keep it real.  Yo, man, you'll be wearing no condoms.  You'll be wearing no condoms in Harlem.  I win.  You know, we messed up. 
[01:00:00]  We should have had tape rolling in the locker room.  Oh, my God.  And we went and had to do yesterday's show.  Unbelievable.  He goes, if you're scared, get a dog.  You're scared of me.  You're scared.  You're scared.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  You're scared of me.  Who's he talking to?  Who's he talking to?  Actually, he was talking to my girlfriend's friend, a girl that was along watching the game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  You know, I want you to have my daughter. 
[01:00:30]  He goes, that's a compliment where I come from.  He goes, that's a compliment.  I won't get you pregnant.  I won't get you pregnant.  You're scared.  You look scared now.  You're scared.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  Get a dog.  That's a compliment.  Get a dog.  That's a compliment where I come from.  Get a dog.  I'm talking to you.  You got them childbearing hips.  I like that.  Come here, baby.  Let me just touch that.  Papi.  Papi.  And you ask.  Hello, mama.  Hello, mama.  Papi.  He was out of his mind.  And you ask, who was he talking to? 
[01:01:00]  Most of the time, we don't know.  No, he's just.  We don't know.  He's just walking around.  He just walks up and down the hallway.  He should do the SNL.  He'd be like, yo, Sherry be losing her mind, yo.  You think anybody care?  No.  Oh, yeah.  He talks about Sherry and Terry.  It's hysterical.  Yeah.  She had a good butt.  She didn't even know it.  She all fine.  She didn't even know it.  She was walking around with Yum-Yums, walking around with Yum-Yums on Riding Day. 
[01:01:30]  Riding Day, she'd come and have them new gray Yum-Yums be showing just above pew blinds.  Just above the equator, yo.  Just above equator.  And just to know it would startle you.  For hours.  Startle you.  Startle you.  Startle you.  No one wanted to go home after the game because he was just killing in the locker room.  For hours.  He pulls his shoe off in his sock and he goes, yeah, would a girl be giving you.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, and your toes be doing this.  And he's got his shoes and socks on.  Curled up.  And he's curling his toes up.  And he's going, oh.  Oh, and he's laying on his back. 
[01:02:00]  And then he flips over on his stomach.  And then she starts.  And he's doing it.  We used to watch.  We used to share a room, man.  We'd turn off the lights.  And he'd always have like crazy, crazy porn.  We were talking.  Me and Tracy were addicted to porn.  We'd be hanging out in the other day.  But he'd love like, yo, Jim, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, F.U.K., F.U.K., F.U.K.,  not the dirty, bud.  It doesn't matter what it's spelt like.  If you say it, they get upset for a while. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I could spell the S word with C's and H's.  Watch, F.U.K.  We learned that.  You can't even say the last name P.U.K. anymore.  Right.  That Vietnamese girl that ran down the street naked after the napalm blast,  her name is P.H.U., you know, and then the rest of it.  So you can't really go there.  I don't see the name, don't you?  I don't see the name, don't you?  I don't see the name, don't you?  Can't be caught up, man.  Toes be curled up.  Yeah, curling up.  That's what I'm talking about.  Can't kill Dable. 
[01:03:00]  Kill that nigga over jealousy.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll just come out with stuff like that.  Took your nigga out.  You know, when your toes be curled up, when you're just about.  That's what he does.  You love come out.  He killed that nigga over jealousy, yo.  That's wrong.  Yo, John be our man, yo.  Is the video up of him just walking around in his jockstrap?  Oh, yeah.  That's up on FoundryMusic.com.  God damn.  Had all the confidence in the world, man.  He has great references, too.  If you ever hung out with him, he brings up some great stuff when we were kids.  He used to talk about, remember the Gargantuans? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Remember the movie Gargantuans?  War of the Gargantuans, yeah.  He would come in and reenact that every day.  Yo, Jim, remember when the brown Gargantuan would go, mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  And the green one.  We had, mm-mm.  And he helped the green one out.  Helped him out.  Because if not, King Q nigga won the Gargantuan, yo.  He's trying to throw his one count up, yo.  He'd be Gargantuan.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  I mean, no.  So he was doing the whole time after the game.  We were just like, in the locker room.  What is he talking about? 
[01:04:00]  What the hell is Tracy talking about?  I'm laughing my ass off, but what the hell is he talking about?  We'll be bugging.  He left, yo.  He should have had it, yo.  Had it.  Your Dow Hammond's still being numb.  Still being.  Lost his head, man.  We couldn't get him back.  Couldn't get him back.  Because King killed that nigga.  So we're sitting in the dugout at one point, and Tracy comes over, and he's just going  off, and he's gawking at all the girls and the scribbles.  Yeah, look at that.  That's nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  And my girlfriend's sitting up on the back of the dugout. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm standing in front of her.  And Tracy looks over and goes, ooh, what we got here?  Yeah.  And he leans over to kiss her on the side of her thigh, and I slip my hand, and I go,  ah, ah, ah.  And he lays a kiss on my swatch, like I had just gotten my arm in there in time before  she was fouled by Tracy Morgan.  He was laughing at her ass off.  Tony, he's the funniest human being I ever hung out with. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Because you've been telling us for a while, like, eh.  He makes me belly laugh hard.  But now, I'm with you now, man.  Hard.  With you, big time.  You got to tell a story about the, um, you were in Harlem with him or something, and then  We started, you started, dude, we, when I was doing Uptown Comedy Club, I had no, you  know, I came from the island, man.  And I must say, that place, you know, don't change it, Jamaica.  Crap.  Oh, and you're from Long Island.  You're going to change it, Jamaica, man.  I mean, you get, you see more black people, like, oh, no, I'm going to get raped. 
[01:05:30]  And they're going to shoot me in the back of my head and go home and bang my mother.  You know, the Long Island Railroad, you know what I mean?  That's a message.  Black people.  Oh, my God, he's black.  The Long Island Railroad, yes, gives a message for all the white boys on Long Island.  They're talking just to us when they say, don't change it, Jamaica.  Yeah, don't change it, Jamaica.  Stay on the train.  They ain't talking to anyone else.  They're talking to the white boys from Valley Stream.  Exactly.  And Centerport and Green Lawn.  Exactly.  When you are from Long Island, or I guess this works for any suburb of a major city, 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to talk Detroit or anywhere, Chicago, when you leave Long Island to go to New York  City, you get on Long Island guy defensive mode, which is just, it's nothing.  Yeah.  And you know it.  Yep.  You go to New York City, and especially when you're growing up, once you get there, you're  just like, all right, watch my back, guys.  Everyone, like you're a pack of these tough guys that are going to do anything.  You're driving in?  You're driving in?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  I ain't driving in.  I'm not driving in.  You guys can go drive in, but I drive in.  Jerry went twice last year, and it was stolen twice.  Explain that.  And when they found it two weeks later in Newark, I don't want to make references of  what, you know what, took it, rhymes with tiggers, but there was a basketball, and the  tennis shoes were still in there, I rest my case.  I'm not making accusations.  I'm just, I ain't driving in the city.  That is when suburbia visits the city.  You go into this battle mode, where you can't totally enjoy it. 
[01:07:00]  You see them walking around.  They're the trouble.  Yeah.  Guys in Long Island, Jersey, the suburb, they're the trouble guys.  They walk around the city, they just see a black guy, like, nigga, if you try it, there's  40 of us.  It's like, excuse me, I'm going to work.  Exactly.  What do you do?  Yeah, work over who?  No, you idiot.  How about this one?  You stop at Jamaica, and they make the announcement, don't change to Jamaica, that's for the white  boys, right?  Yeah.  But then they have to wait for another train, so they open the doors at Jamaica, and you're 
[01:07:30]  like, oh God, do they have to do that?  Oh no, stop it.  No, you're just giving them a chance.  You're giving them a chance, and come on.  And look at us.  Great.  Now they can easily get away.  Great exchange, dicks.  And you just watch the open door, just waiting for it to close.  Just waiting to be robbed.  When you're from Long Island, this is the stuff that makes you paranoid.  You're like, oh God, they're already telling us, don't get out at Jamaica, and now they're  opening the doors.  Oh my God.  You start turning into that platform dude, like every two seconds, your platform dudes 
[01:08:00]  are the guys that get all the way, as close as they can, they go over the yellow line,  no fear.  Yeah.  And they're looking over, like, to see where the tracks are, but they're leaning over the  tracks, like, I do not fear falling in.  You can't do that.  I do not fear it.  Where is this train?  I see the lights.  It's coming.  It's coming, everybody.  I do not.  The first dude that knows it's coming.  You know what happened?  Yeah.  You know what happened last year to one of those dudes?  He got hit in the back of the head by a subway car.  He was looking the other way for the train.  He was looking the wrong way.  And the train came up behind him.  Big story in New York last year.  He just knocked his head off. 
[01:08:30]  What a jackass.  There's no reason to, when I go, when I go down into the subway to get on the train,  I stand back from the line.  Because first of all, you don't know what a lunatic.  First of all, you don't know a lunatic is going to push you.  It's going to push you.  He was, he was talking to me.  I heard it out his head.  What?  Yeah.  No, I was just standing waiting for the, boom, there you go.  He was the spaceship man.  Yeah.  You can't have broccoli with two doors and some chili.  Now take the clouds and look out, you dummy, or I'll take that shirt of yours and I'll 
[01:09:00]  let you know about the cars.  Now let's go.  It's America.  There's no way you stand by that line.  Oh my God, I never thought he would push them.  Yeah.  Everyone's always surprised.  It's not like the guy in the suit is pushing people under the train.  I'm the guy that goes right against the wall where you can't even put a credit card  between me and the wall.  Lean against the wall.  There's no reason.  It's 50 feet up and if I take one inch out of it, the railing, I get that feeling like 
[01:09:30]  when you're hanging out, even when the train's coming, I can be right against the wall like  you will, but I still feel there's some genetic force that's going to suck me at the last  second.  Like pull you and push you in front of the train.  And there is no one, there is no one that could give me any valid reason for leaning over  and looking for the train.  When it gets there, it gets there.  Exactly.  Because you're all a bunch of impatient F's.  Well, you know, I can't wait to get to my job to be miserable for eight hours today.  It's not an impatient.  Come home, drink and punch my wife in the forehead.  Because if you look, I look as long as I know there's no one within a hundred feet. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, her sister will try to bang her for the next week.  As long as I know there's no one within a hundred feet of me.  There's no reason to look.  Come on, dog, let's take a walk so I can get high.  Because you're going to see it, you're going to see it, what, three to four seconds before  it gets there?  I mean, there's no reason.  And like, that's going to make it go faster.  Yeah.  I think it's the...  It's not working today.  It's coming.  Here it comes, that guy.  You know, you've got to be the guy that...  I'm the leader, let me take a piece.  It's coming.  It's coming.  The train's coming.  I just saw it.  I leaned over. 
[01:10:30]  I took the risk.  I heard it.  I heard it.  Oh, crap.  It's the other side.  Don't get in that one.  That goes to Lindbrook.  I changed to Long Beach.  Don't go in that one.  Dude, how about the puke train?  Coming back from the shows?  Coming back from the garden.  Oh, those are always fun, yeah.  Guys arguing about the Rangers and the Islanders.  I feel bad for the Long Island Railroad employees after the Ranger games, after the Nick games,  and after, like, the Aussie concert or whatever at the garden. 
[01:11:00]  Tickets, please.  Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.  Get off me, dick.  It just turns out to be the puke-slash-make-out train.  Whenever it goes to stop at a stage, you just see this liquid going to the front of the  train when it stops, going to the back when they take off again.  It's a time.  Feed up.  Feed up.  It's a vomit time.  Everyone has their concert tees, and they are just snotty.  Hammered.  Dude, I'm so glad they played Girls, Girls, Girls, Man. 
[01:11:30]  I'm so glad they played that.  When they left, I didn't think they were going to do it.  Didn't think, but they came back.  And everyone goes home or goes to their car or whatever they're going to after they get  off the train with the flat, my head's been against the window, asleep hairdo.  Are you guys going to bed or are we going to get something to eat?  Let's go to the diner.  Let's go to the excited diner.  Come on.  Fries, gravy.  What are we doing?  Come on.  Let's go see Akka.  Akka.  Akka.  Yeah, whatever his name is, man.  You know the Greek dude. 
[01:12:00]  They're all Greek.  Mama Buki.  Mama Buki.  What's your dirty word?  Got to get a little breakfast after the show.  Sure.  Some diner fun.  Never hurt anyone, right?  How do you say your mama likes the Buki in the Greek?  Hurry up.  Here you come.  Hey, what's up, Stravaros?  Stravaros.  Stravaros.  It's the way I like it.  No mushrooms, dick.  You snuck them in last week, you dickhead. 
[01:12:30]  And there's nothing worse than being a goddamn diner when there are just little gangs of people  that are at the booths throwing crap at each other and just being loud and obnoxious.  I think Jerry got caught.  I don't think he got on the...  He might have been in Long Beach.  Should we look for him?  Dude, you're supposed to make sure he got on the train.  F him.  Let him wake up and want off.  He'll get up in Port Jeff.  Port Jeff, yeah.  Where'd this conversation start?  Tracy Moore. 
[01:13:00]  I was trying to figure that out, though.  Tracy, holy crap.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Let me lick that off.  First, call Fidelity at 201-261-6555 for a private appointment.  Every step of the way, you'll receive expert guidance as you choose from the area's largest  Loose Diamond Inventory.  You view your diamond under magnification and see...  Michelle, 1027.  WNEW.  You view your diamond in the city tonight. 
[01:13:30]  We're looking for you inside of the fight.  There's an evil feeling in our brains, but there's nothing to do without us to say.  Run it.  I know we had it.  You will be tired.  What's out of the neck?  Run it.  I know we had it.  You will be tired.  What's out of the neck?  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:00]  In studio, one of our, I don't know, what do you call them?  One of our best friends.  Bestest pals.  A true friend of the show.  He played in the Celebrity Softball game Saturday.  Thank you.  He was the MVP of the game.  I was not.  You're an animal on the mound.  Oh, yeah.  The ERA was...  I had a bad game, bro. 
[01:14:30]  But look at your stats.  Four for four.  You scored four.  Two ribbies.  And flawless at first base.  Dude, I was training.  I was training.  You were, I remember.  And then I realized what a dick I was when I saw Norton and how much he didn't care.  Yeah.  I turned around Norton just looking at me like...  Hold on.  You're with me then.  He shows up at Riverfront Stadium, right?  It looked like he didn't care, right?  He had dress shoes on, right?  I made the dress shoes and black socks.  And black socks.  So I, being kind of like... 
[01:15:00]  Like khaki shorts.  I'm like the player coach.  As the player coach, I'm thinking to myself, you know what?  He doesn't care.  We kind of care.  I'm sitting him.  He got out of there.  He got pissed.  He did really?  He's like, dude, why aren't you playing me?  I'm like, you got dress shoes on.  You're going to break your neck out in right field.  Dress shoes.  And then, you know what?  In all fairness, I put him out there and he did great.  He did do good.  He did.  He had a good game.  Everyone had a good game.  We're at...  I have to say, though.  Yeah.  Ant, it was so gay when you tried to butt. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  You know something.  I swear to God, I got so pissed.  I literally got pissed at you.  I wanted to punch you.  Why wouldn't I want to just do that?  Is that the most annoying...  Don't you remember just playing in the street and the one fag goes to bunt?  Yeah.  Like, what are you...  How dicky is that?  Dude, that deserves an...  That was pretty dicky.  It was so gay.  I think everyone started booing you.  Then I swung away.  Oh.  Dude.  You know, I was seeing what happened.  That was an insult to the game. 
[01:16:00]  It was...  It was...  I was trying to test Opie a little.  I want to see how he would have handled a ball off the third base line.  But I'm thinking to myself, is he really bunting?  I didn't know what he did.  I didn't know if he did as a goof.  He would have flustered you.  If you did as a goof, it would have been funny, man.  But you...  Yeah, that was a goof.  No, come on.  You were so serious.  You wanted a hit.  You wanted a hit.  But...  And I truly believe if you bunt it and ran it out, you still would have got booed.  People would be like, what a dick.  Did you ever bunt kickball, you fag? 
[01:16:30]  How do you bunt in kickball?  Did you get this fag?  With my shin, I just...  You can't bunt kickball, you idiot.  Go back to the plate.  There was someone that always bunted in kickball.  No one called it.  Get back to the plate.  They do that little...  Yeah.  Bink.  With the...  No one called you.  Get back to the plate.  The red ball.  I'd get the ping.  Ping!  Make that little ringing noise.  We had a girl at Washington Drive School that would strike out a kickball every time.  Oh, that's pathetic.  Did she drool? 
[01:17:00]  Like, come on.  What is wrong with your eyes?  Especially a guy...  I can see a girl, but a guy, that deserves a shove right into the sand under the monkey bars.  Larry, are you kidding me?  I've seen people get their feet tied up in the ball and then fall down.  No, that's awesome.  They do the kick and then their other foot crosses their leg and...  All right.  Wham!  I've got to interrupt you guys, unfortunately, because Kreskin's on the line.  Oh, my goodness.  Opie, do you know what Kreskin is up to?  He called the show about a month ago.  Yes.  And we have not forgotten, and we're going to see this all the way through, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:17:30]  This is another prediction that the amazing Kreskin is making.  And it concerns, Opie, UFOs.  UFO sightings.  Cuckoo.  If I could read this press release.  Hey, hey, hey, don't judge.  Don't judge.  Right.  I'm the spaceship man.  Stoners, start getting out Wesley Pudge.  Here it is.  His press release. 
[01:18:00]  They're here.  UFO sighting alert.  New York.  Listen to the man.  One month ago, the amazing Kreskin issued a statement regarding the largest UFO sighting ever recorded to TV, radio, and news media throughout North America.  In his statement, not only did the amazing Kreskin predict this fantastic event, he also forecasted the location of the sightings as being the Nevada desert sometime in May or June of 2002.  Although Kreskin first made this prediction while on tour in Canada in March of 2002, it was not until April 2002 that he formally issued a statement. 
[01:18:30]  So sure is he of his ability to predict the future events with incredible accuracy.  He is willing to back the prediction with an understanding of turning over to charity $50,000 should this prediction fail.  Since releasing a statement, Kreskin has received worldwide attention.  Okay, here it is.  Is he off the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, don't pick Kreskin up right now because we don't want him hearing this. 
[01:19:00]  I just feel bad for Kreskin.  Since releasing a statement, Kreskin has received worldwide attention.  Just like the time he came in and did that Osama Bin Laden thing and said, I've got to run outside because the media is waiting to interview me.  And he had his TV makeup on and there was no one outside.  Dude, this guy gets no attention from the media.  He has not...  Now I've got a whole new perspective.  Since he had makeup on, now I've got a whole new perspective.  He put makeup on.  We're like, why do you have makeup on? 
[01:19:30]  It's like Kreskin, it's radio.  Why do you have makeup on?  It's radio, right.  After this, there's going to be so much press that is going to want to interview me, Kreskin, that I have to put the makeup on to meet with the news crews.  And he did some, like, I don't know, what amounted to a card trick.  I didn't even know, like, what he thought was going to happen.  He thought he was really breaking Osama Bin Laden's neck or leg or something.  His leg or something.  And he fell down and we thought he...  We didn't know it was part of the trick or whatever.  We thought he was having a stroke.  He actually, yeah, to make it all dramatic, when a pin was placed in this voodoo doll's leg, he fell down. 
[01:20:00]  And so we're like, oh, my God, Kreskin, are you okay?  He's like, yes, I'm feeling.  Because his glasses went flying and everything.  And we're like, oh, it's part of the gag, I guess.  His hair flew off.  Get up, Faggy.  Like Arba Dwyer when he shot himself in the head.  His hair went...  There's a clip of it.  His glasses came off.  Up on foundry, I think.  It was amazing.  Ridiculous.  It was amazing.  Amazing, Kreskin.  It was amazing to watch him fall down and lose his glasses.  And my shoes fell off.  So did I have them?  I have them.  I can't see, God damn it.  Kreskin's getting impatient on the phone. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, okay, hold on, hold on.  Since releasing a statement, worldwide attention.  Inquiries regarding this event pouring in daily, it says.  Because of the staggering number of inquiries on this matter during...  Okay, let me...  During the last several weeks, Kreskin has agreed to make a public statement in Nevada on Monday, June 3, 2002, at 7 a.m.  That was a couple of days ago.  For those who want to witness this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He will then announce the exact date and approximate time of the sighting.  So, I guess he's announced this exact date. 
[01:21:00]  There's a massive UFO sighting.  Largest...  The biggest one ever recorded.  Ever.  Ever.  Let's get Kreskin on the line here and see where we're at with the largest UFO sighting.  All right.  Oh, oh, amazing.  Kreskin, are you there?  Anthony, Rick, I am here.  How are you?  Oh, what about Opie?  Rick, Jim, Opie, whatever.  You know something...  I forgot about Opie, I did that deliberately.  I want to make sure you're listening.  You don't like me.  Kreskin.  I hope I don't say that.  Kreskin.  Have I ever hit you on the shoulder? 
[01:21:30]  Kreskin.  Kreskin.  What?  Kreskin.  Just go with it.  Anthony, I've got to tell you.  Kreskin.  Kreskin, first let me make a statement, Kreskin.  I am so excited about this.  I have been a fan of yours, and I have been a UFO.  I love UFOs and all that stuff.  And when you said you were going to announce the largest UFO sighting ever recorded, I was  fascinated by this, Kreskin.  And now, you have announced the exact date of this, Kreskin? 
[01:22:00]  Well, it came to a point, yeah, Monday, I made a decision, and the date, as I said, it's  going to be this Thursday, which is really tomorrow, and it'll be between about 10 minutes  of 10 at night to midnight.  I can't give the exact time.  All right, when is it?  Wait a minute.  What was that again?  Let me write that.  Between 9.50 and midnight.  Not New York time, but West Coast time, sometime before 10 o'clock and midnight.  What happened, this has gotten a little bit out of control. 
[01:22:30]  I bet.  We've gotten thousands and thousands of calls, and people flying in from Australia.  Wow, just to see this.  Hey, hey, who?  In fact, I mean, right now, I'm sitting in a room with us.  Kreskin, who has called you?  Thousands and thousands of people.  Just give us a few.  Anyone famous?  No, I'm sitting here with a crew from the affiliate here at NBC and ABC, because we  went out to the, I'll tell you what we had to do.  Sure you are.  I, I, uh.  Did you go to the site?  Did you go to the site, Kreskin?  Yes.  Yes.  And I'll tell you why.  What is it like out there, just knowing that that, oh, it's just, first of all. 
[01:23:00]  That's not the affiliate, that's your little nephew, Jimmy, with a camcorder.  Let's take Grandpa.  He's crazy.  You have to end up walking the desert at night and suddenly find me, you don't know where  the hell you are.  Right.  I've been out there.  I did a stupid thing.  Well, I've done a lot of stupid things, but a few nights ago, I, I needed to get,  get away from everything.  So I took a cab from the Silverton, which is where I'm headlining the past month and  a half.  And you ate peyote buttons like Jim Morrison and wandered the desert.  So I went down, I went to downtown Vegas and I walked around at two in the morning. 
[01:23:30]  I said, heck, I'll walk back to the casino that I'm at.  Well, that is normally about a 12 hour trip.  I got lost and the police found me walking on a highway towards Reno and I finally made  it back to the hotel.  I walked 18 miles.  I got back at 10 minutes of five in the morning and I said, I called, I called the president  and said, this is crazy.  I'm not going to have people walking in the desert.  Right.  We picked a certain site where everyone's going to gather.  Everyone's going to gather. 
[01:24:00]  And Preskin, if you could please tell us, what will these people see?  Well, I can't tell you exactly, but it will be no more than four satellites, three or four  UFOs.  It's not going to be shooting stars.  It's nothing.  No one's going to be able to say, well, I looked at one of Carl Sagan's charts.  It's not going to be any more than three.  Are they going to be able to tell that these are indeed some type of spacecraft?  There I can't say because, you know, look at the history of UFOs and I've been sitting 
[01:24:30]  discussing with people so many times.  And by the way, someone asked me, Anthony and Oprah, you get a kick out of this.  They asked him, do I intend to send up some space balloons or some satellites?  Well, people might think that, the skeptics.  Yeah.  I said, you know something, Spielberg wasn't interested, so I couldn't really afford it.  So we're going to have to do this legitimately.  Kreskin, have you been making the Devil's Tower monument out of mashed potatoes?  Have you done that? 
[01:25:00]  But guys, I'll tell you one thing.  Yes, yes, Kreskin.  The day after Friday in the press conference, I have something to say about the ramifications  of this, and then it's much more serious and much more significant in light of what's  going on in the world right now.  So will there be a follow-up after this, maybe the importance of this sighting?  I have a lot to say.  You do.  And I am not playing games.  Hey, Kreskin, Matt brings up a good point.  How does a psychic get lost in the desert?  Oh, you wise guys.  Hey, listen, guys, I'm going to talk to you probably on Friday. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God, Kreskin.  I'm so excited about this.  It's going to be in the Nevada desert.  Yeah.  And I tell the folks, look at the news.  Look into the news.  I mean, we've got some...  And by the way...  Hey, can we put one of the affiliates on the line with us?  Guys.  What?  No, they don't want to.  They don't want...  Guys, I can't do it.  They won't do it.  Hey, come on.  Damn.  Listen, guys, I'm going to talk to you probably on Friday.  Okay?  Okay, Kreskin.  Take care.  Best of luck to you and your UFO sighting. 
[01:26:00]  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you a couple of days.  Bye.  My position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right, hold on.  Let me just...  I just want this to sit for a second.  Let me just sit.  We love Kreskin.  He'd be one of the greatest all-time stoner plays ever.  And it's just...  He should have a play in Amsterdam  where he'd have like a 300-sitter  and he'd get baked  and take some mushrooms  and then just let him come out with a spotlight. 
[01:26:30]  He'd tear it up.  He thinks...  He would tear it up.  He thinks that...  Now, see, what I got from this?  You're not going to see these machines,  these ships flying over.  You're not going to see any of that.  What you're going to see  is something in the desert sky  like a light, 
[01:27:00]  some type of thing  that, of course,  will have been sent up prior to it,  a flare on a balloon,  some type of thing.  How uncomfortable is it going to be  when nothing happens  and all those thousands of people  are going to just walk away  all uncomfortably  as Kreskin sits there and goes,  but...  Like the scene from Vacation?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A grave fight.  A riot ensues afterwards.  I see Dr. Bellows standing there.  But the UFO...  Major Nelson, there was... 
[01:27:30]  And then when I looked,  it was...  But there was a girl  and she was in my...  But then...  Oh, I need my headache powders.  just when I saw the UFO.  What?  But then when I looked,  it went...  And it's something strange  because Major Nelson,  I...  But then I...  But I turned...  I turned around and...  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  Oh, my...  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  What did you see, Lou? 
[01:28:00]  Lou, you're delirious.  What did you see, Lou?  Yeah, you saw a light  in the sky, Lou?  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm...  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  Hey, I'm bad.  Now, I've taken a look, Lou,  and there's nothing there.  I'm just telling you...  I'm just telling you...  Hey! 
[01:28:30]  Hey, just...  Stop it!  Stop!  There's no such thing  as flying saucers, Lou.  Hey!  Now, go to bed  so Dracula can come  out of the wall behind.  ridiculous uh oh a guy from uh one of the local news things in vegas dude brilliant

But it seems to mean something.  Be, to you humans.  What, what, what?  We are being probed.  Wow!  What is that word?  Wow.  1027, W and E, W.  So now, moving out from the world.  The city of the NX, man, get the test.  Please, so now.  Everybody in the world is safe.

Everybody in the world is safe.  We'll be knocked down the wax from your rectum creed.  Next day.  I'm going to blast off worldwide.  Worldwide.  Worldwide.  I'm going to blast off worldwide.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Executioners.  Going down.  We've got a bunch of people that want in on the staple gun roulette game, Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  I'll never understand this.  Let me go to Matt real fast.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  If you guys really want to put a meaty clip into somebody's thigh, use a T25.  That's what I work for the phone company.  That's what we use to staple a ground wire to the side of a house.  Well, what do you mean, sir?  We might as well just get pneumatic nail guns.  Yeah, we don't want to kill these guys.  Well, come on. 
[01:35:30]  This is for wrestling tickets, right?  For a trip.  Well, even better, a trip.  It's a good trip, too.  It's all about the anticipation.  Yes.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You got it.  We don't want to, like, really, really hurt them.  Yeah.  How many of these guys are we going to get?  Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Hey, what's up?  Real fast.  Hey, listen, as funny as it sounds, there's a femoral artery inside of your thigh, so it'd  be hilarious, but they could bleed to death all over your studio.  Dude, are you a fool?  We will have a doctor on site. 
[01:36:00]  First of all, do you know how far into your leg that is?  It's next to the bone.  Well, if you're talking about the staples that, you know, put the cables on the side of your  house, I think it'd probably reach.  I don't think so.  You want to take the chance?  Look at the doctor over here.  Yeah, we're going to have a doctor that, you know, kind of, I don't know, ropes off the  area that we could use.  Put the pictures up.  We'll be fine.  All right, Matt.  We know what we're doing.  It gets broken with bullets and when people fly through windshields and it cuts their leg 
[01:36:30]  halfway off.  Not a staple.  Jeff from D.C., what's up?  Hey, I just wondered if you guys were going to have a little Vietnamese guy in the background  yelling, D.D. Mao, and slapping him around when they did it.  Oh, that would be funny.  Wouldn't that be great while he's, like, thinking about stapling himself?  The guy's smacking him.  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Do it, Nicky.  Do it.  Nicky, do it.  Show these motherfuckers.  Do it, Nicky.  Thank you, Jeff.  You're right.  You're welcome. 
[01:37:00]  You guys rock.  There's a panic going on outside the studio.  Rick is talking to Super GM Ken Stevens about.  Rick came running in here to grab the staple gun to show Ken Stevens.  Rick is now back into the studio.  And what is going on, Rick?  Well, he just has some concerns, some questions that I was trying to answer for him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That means he's calling the lawyers.  When they call the lawyers, it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Well, I'm willing.  What has he said?  He said, would you be willing to take a staple to prove that it's not that bad? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I'll do it.  And I said, sure.  I'll do it.  If it means we can do it on the air, I'll do it.  Exactly.  No problem.  No problem.  And you know something?  I'll watch Opie do it.  Right in.  Come on.  You're with me, right?  That I got to do it?  Sometimes we got to lead.  Go down the hall and tell them I'll take a staple.  No problem.  Ask Ken.  Will he take one if we take one?  That's right.  He's the GM.  He's supposed to stand behind us. 
[01:38:00]  Would you do that?  Yeah.  I mean, it's no, like, big deal.  You're not going to need to be hospitalized.  I'll do it.  But it's the anticipation and the pain.  Anthony, if it means that we could do this on the radio, yes, I will.  And then it gets, you know what pierce wounds are like?  They hurt really bad.  Well, because it's like a bee sting.  Yeah.  And they, like, they throb and swell up the, well, the holes. 
[01:38:30]  I'm waiting to see if Rick's coming down the hall or not.  With Ken.  With Ken.  I want to know why, first of all, why do we have to do it?  That doesn't prove anything.  Oh, there he is.  I know it can be done.  He's looking.  He's got the staple gun in his hand.  He doesn't look happy.  Hi, Ken.  Ken, go over there.  Ken.  Super GM, Ken Stevens.  You've heard about the contest we want to run for the King of the Ring giveaway?  You might imagine I had a few questions.  A few questions.  Like, when I call the attorney and go like this. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Do you think he's going to go for that?  Well, there's ways around it.  Yeah.  It's like a piercing.  That's what I said.  Oh.  Rick said it'd just be little tiny staples.  Yeah.  Not too big.  He said he'd be willing to take a staple so I could talk to the attorney and say,  And say, they did it.  Yeah.  And then we'll have a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge contest if we do it first.  Let me see that.  I've got a loaded gun here.  Oh, let me see. 
[01:39:30]  Now, Ken.  Ken, if I do this right now, will you let us do the contest?  No, I can't.  Why?  I can't let you do that.  Why?  That's wrong.  That'll hurt.  Dude, you've got to go, yeah, and do it as you've got to scream right before you do it.  And then do it.  Look at Opie, man, taking one for the team.  But I want him to promise that if I do it, then we can do this on the radio.  Yeah.  I'll do it right now.  It does seem like the kind of thing where, hey, Opie did it.  It's not this big life-threatening thing.  But I can't promise that even when I say Opie did it, because, you know, he might say, yeah. 
[01:40:00]  I'll even let you do it to me.  Oh, that's even cool.  I know at this point you want to punch me in the face, so here's your opportunity.  Put the staple gun down.  Do it to me.  In some twisted way, I want to see Opie do this.  I really want to see this.  Oh, watch out.  Those things don't want to.  Oh, man.  Where did you get hit, Ken?  I mean, I heard that.  Did it wing past his ear?  I saw him like... 
[01:40:30]  He's just shooting at the boss with your staple gun, dude.  I want to make believe it just went off.  I must say...  How close was that?  How close?  It was very close.  It went by the back of his neck.  Sing.  I got to say something right now, though.  Yeah.  You holding that is one of the most dangerous things.  Look, it's stinky.  Everybody's looking like...  Because I know you.  You fiddle with stuff, and all of a sudden, phew, someone's eye goes out.  No!  They don't shoot straight.  Don't point it at me. 
[01:41:00]  Don't point it at me.  All right.  Let's do it.  The thing...  You know something?  When you nail it into newspapers, a pile of newspapers, you really get the effect that  that thing pushes hard, man.  Let me see.  All right.  I don't even know if I have the balls to do this.  Let me see.  Put it on your knee and do it.  It won't go through the papers, but it'll give you a feeling.  Right.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Dude, here's something me and you could do today.  We take the newspapers.  Right.  We go back and forth, taking one page off at a time. 
[01:41:30]  And see who gets hit first.  I'll do that.  Come on.  That's fun.  Let's do it.  All right.  We have another stapler with staples?  That one's full.  Yeah?  I loaded it.  All right.  Start with one newspaper.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  We're in the paper today.  You pick that page.  Put it through my head.  Yeah, daily news.  Cute little story about us.  Yeah.  Something about us running a foul.  We were running a foul. 
[01:42:00]  I'm going to save that for my little scrapbook.  First one of those we've had.  There you go.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We've got to take a break.  Oh, I thought you were going to do the first round.  Oh, that's easy.  All right.  All right.  Is it?  Is that thick enough?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Did it hit?  No, but I think it is.  Dude, seriously.  What do you think? 
[01:42:30]  It's already sticking out a little bit.  Oh, it's already sticking out.  All right.  All right.  My turn.  Take the page off.  Hey, no.  I do it with a full page.  No.  That's the deal.  We keep going back and forth.  There you go.  This is no fair now.  Already.  There you go.  No fair.  Take the page.  Oh, I felt that a little bit.  Wow, yes.  All right.  All right.  Take another page off of the paper.  There you go.  You're actually removing two sheets. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, two sheets because of the full page.  All right.  From the newspaper.  Oh, no.  What did it do?  It went through.  Did it?  Boy, how thick is the goddamn page?  No, dude, because you're going to feel it now?  Yeah, I know.  Let's see who bails first.  It's kind of like, name that tune.  All right.  I felt a little bit.  You did?  I'm not going to sit here and cry and sit at a heart, but you can definitely feel it.  All right? 
[01:43:30]  Ah!  There we go.  Did you feel it?  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  I did.  All right.  I swear I did.  I'm just doing that.  Oh, wow.  Look, it looked a hole.  I'm just doing, you know.  I'm doing the Robert De Niro scream before I do it.  What are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  Put your pants on.  I don't want to put a hole in my jeans.  Are you kidding me?  What?  It goes between the weave. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Give me that.  Shut up.  You're starting to feel a little more every time.  Yeah, every time.  You never realize how thick a newspaper page is.  There you go.  Until it's a staple throw.  All right.  That's a cute little weight loss picture.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now it's coming through pretty good.  Wow.  All right.  How can't our listeners have fun like this? 
[01:44:30]  This is fun.  All right.  Give me that.  Thank you.  Removed.  Isn't it really starting to like...  Yeah.  You can definitely feel it.  Here you go.  We're moving on the page.  All right.  Hand it over to me.  Wings win one from cup.  Red wing zero.  Hurricane zero.  Red wings.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:45:00]  Anything?  Anything?  Yes.  That's getting thin, man.  This is getting thin.  All right.  Who will be the first guy to bail?  You know how the sports section's in the back and all the important stuff is on the first  page of the back of the newspaper?  Yeah.  We're up to penalty kicks in South Korea.  All right.  We really don't have much of the sports section left.  Give me that.  All right.  First guy to bail.  Ooh! 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  That's like you're feeling it.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Another page off.  Uh-oh.  I see an advertisement.  Are we through the sports page?  Looking forward.  Forget three people.  Lakers want more.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I'm going to put it through Shaq's head.  His big head.  Ooh!  Are you out?  Nope.  But I think I'm bleeding. 
[01:46:00]  You're not out?  Nope.  Oh, God.  He removes another page.  Hey, we're into the real estate section.  Oh, God.  You know, you can buy a nice house in the Poconos.  Okay.  Watch that femoral artery.  What was that?  Okay.  Oh, no.  Hey, here's a cute little cartoon about Tyson. 
[01:46:30]  Not the comics.  Oh.  Wow, this is getting really thin.  Bill Gallo's cartoon.  Oh, God.  Holy crap.  All right.  Another page.  Here's the stapler.  There you go.  Shane Spencer had a grand slam.  Yes, we know.  Okay. 
[01:47:00]  Ooh!  Wow!  All right.  Oh!  It started to stick.  Yeah, yeah.  I noticed.  All right.  Here you go.  Ah.  All right.  Stapler, please.  We'll get Andre Agassi and his eight-month-old son, Jaden Gill.  We're...  Oh, my God! 
[01:47:30]  Are you out?  No, but one page.  Oh, come on, man.  One more page is gone.  Just bail.  Oh, damn.  It's a really smartness thing.  All right.  I'm seeing marks.  Come on. 
[01:48:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  It's starting to really, like, hurt.  We can both bail right now.  Give me that guy.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh!  Wow!  Jesus!  Wow!  HBO, free installation for three months.  Take another page out of the paper. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, the stocks.  Who cares?  You can start counting how many pages are left now.  It's getting to that point.  I gave up on the stock market years ago.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Oof.  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Yeah, that must have hurt.  It stuck to his leg.  Yeah.  All right.  Like you said, we can both bail. 
[01:49:00]  Well, no.  You're up next.  Oh.  You can bail.  That means I win.  Yeah, I know.  Come on.  Come on.  Here it is.  Another round.  Hand it over.  Yeah!  Hand it over.  Yeah.  That is very, very thin now.  Oh, it's very thin.  Do the other leg.  No, I'm keeping the same leg.  Oh, man!  God damn it!  Holy Jesus!  There is just no insulation anymore. 
[01:49:30]  Now it's just...  Oh, you're in the now section in the middle of the paper.  That's a pamphlet.  I'm in the...  Yeah.  Ow!  Some people are having trouble understanding what we're doing.  It's very obvious.  There's the staple gun.  Another sheet of...  We started with a newspaper and every round we're taking a sheet away. 
[01:50:00]  There is...  Look.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Ten left.  Ten pages.  Ten and flipped over again, so 20 pages.  20 pieces of newspaper.  20 layers of paper left.  First guy out.  Loses.  Give me a stapler.  Man still hasn't forgiven his girlfriend for hurting him. 
[01:50:30]  I'll put it right through Lil Orphan Annie.  Oh, dude!  Check out your thighs!  Oh, fudge!  Fudge!  Wow, look at that coming right through.  Oh, man.  Dude, check out your thighs.  I did already.  It looks like bee stings all over my life.  That one is worse, though.  Let me look.  That one's worse.  All right.  Give me the staple gun.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, my God!  He's got track marks. 
[01:51:00]  Good luck.  He looks like the heroin chick from yesterday.  We're down to 18 sheets of paper.  Wow.  All right.  Give me that.  Good luck.  Give me that.  All right.  18 sheets left between our leg and the staple gun. 
[01:51:30]  Can someone remind me why we're doing this?  Oh, my God.  Well, our contestants will go right into their thigh without a paper.  Right.  Down to 16 sheets.  Just like we are in a matter of...  Oh, look who's back in!  Hi, Ken.  How are you?  Ken Stevens.  What did I miss?  You're missing, like, a lot.  We are taking...  See?  Look.  We're doing it to ourselves.  We're taking the newspaper out of protest, I think.  We started with a full daily news, and we put it on top of our leg and went through.  And then each time we go back and forth, me and Opie, we're taking a sheet off, and 
[01:52:00]  it's getting thinner and thinner and really, really hurting now.  And the first guy that bails loses.  Ken, have you talked to any of the lawyers?  Yes, I have.  And what is the verdict?  Well, if Opie will take one in the forehead, no.  Leave the comedy to these people.  You in the offices, you never try to be funny.  Yeah.  Never try to be funny in your office, now do we?  No, that was an attorney joke, not mine.  Ken, would you like to watch?  It's down to how many sheets between the staple gun and the thigh? 
[01:52:30]  I think we're down to 16.  Are you bailing?  Ant's bailing.  Of course.  Ant's out.  Do it.  Ant's out.  Do it.  Don't do it.  Ant's out.  Do it.  Ant's out.  Oh.  Oh.  One less sheet.  Oh, my God.  Opie, now it just downright hurts.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, times two. 
[01:53:00]  Fourteen pages.  Fourteen sheets of newspapers.  Now we're losing huge percents of the thickness.  All right.  All right.  Geez.  That one hurts.  Yeah.  Now pull it out of your leg.  Pull it out of your leg.  Ow.  That one hurts.  All right.  I have to stop because I'm bleeding through my pants. 
[01:53:30]  I'm quitting.  You can't quit.  Dude, I'm bleeding through my pants.  There's no quitting in staple guns.  Gun roulette.  Bleeding through my pants.  You can't quit.  I concede defeat to you, Opie.  Let me see.  Bravo.  You're the better man.  Let me see the blood.  Oh, my God.  Right through the pants.  All right.  We happy?  All right.  Well, I guess.  What we do for you bastards. 
[01:54:00]  Save them all.  You're just going to give me the victory like that?  I have to.  And then you're going to get like three hours of people calling you a pussy now.  I don't care because the last time I did it, right before you just did it, it hurt really bad.  It hurt a lot.  And it's not going to get better.  See, it's not going to be like, wow, we're down to two sheets and this is a breeze now.  And let me just suggest something, though.  Yeah.  If you can make it through the next round, just imagine the pain I'm going to feel.  I know.  Come on.  One, two, three, four, five, six. 
[01:54:30]  Were we down to six after mine?  So there's 12 sheets.  No, because you're an idiot.  I'm going to do it and you're going to go, okay.  I quit.  I'll tell you right now, I do not want to lose this contest.  I know you don't and I'm giving it to you.  Come on.  12 sheets.  It's all about your honor.  The lister's going to call you.  It's not my honor.  It's my leg that is bleeding through my pants.  They're going to call you a pussy for the next three hours. 
[01:55:00]  Ah, pussah.  12 sheets.  12 sheets.  I think I have one more in you.  Let me see the thickness.  Feel the thickness.  That's nothing.  It's tissue paper.  Look at this.  Oh, get out of town.  Come on.  Get out of town.  Get out of town.  Shut up, Garrett.  What do you think?  Staple gun.  Do it.  It's really, really.  What do you think?  No, you know why? 
[01:55:30]  Because, look, you're going to do it regardless.  We'll see.  You're going to do it regardless.  So you win anyway.  I'm not going to.  I'm going to have to back out twice.  The only difference is maybe I'm going to have another staple in my leg.  Maybe I'm putting a poker face on right now.  Do you think?  Maybe I'm a pussy and I'm just trying to.  No, because you won.  What, Pokemon?  You won the pot.  I'm thinking, well, I'm not going to tell you what I'm thinking.  This is like double or nothing.  Come on, Ian.  They're already calling you a pussy all over the list.  I know they are.  I see it. 
[01:56:00]  It's the staple gun challenge.  There's 12 sheets left.  We start at like 100.  Am I handing over the staple gun to you?  Just let me feel it.  All right.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Come on, do it.  Oh, my God.  Dan, this is really bad.  Do it.  What do you think?  There's a sweat on it.  Oh, no.  Son of a...  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  Dan.  Oh, God.  Damn it, man.  That hurt like a mother.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  That looks like it hurts.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy crap.  You win.  Wow.  Here's the one last thing if you decide to do it.  You win.  Ah, you suck. 
[01:57:00]  You win.  Oh, my God.  All right.  What are we up to here?  I have...  No way.  Let me just say...  Holy jeez, that stings so bad.  That stings like now it feels like it did at the moment of impact.  It has not stopped hurting.  It's 10 sheets left.  Oh, am I a faggot?  Do we have disinfectant soap in the bathroom? 
[01:57:30]  Can we maybe get a real nurse down here?  Because we are bleeding.  Oh, God damn it.  I'm serious.  If there's a nurse nearby with some disinfectant, we could use it today.  Oof.  Wow.  I didn't think you had the balls to do it.  I don't.  I don't have the brains to not do it.  And I saw John over here.  He goes, I just lost a case of beer on Ant.  And I felt bad that, you know, the guy was betting on me.  All I know is, if I could do this, I will definitely win.  You will absolutely win.  And I put you through a lot of pain. 
[01:58:00]  Because I will not do this.  And Opie, let me tell you something.  I so talked you into that.  Come on.  I know.  But let me tell you something before you do this.  Right.  The one I did before wasn't near as bad as the one I just did.  We are at the point now where I guess the elasticity of the skin is not a matter anymore.  This now hurts so bad when you do it.  And you have two less pieces of paper in between the stapler and you now. 
[01:58:30]  By the way.  So expect a lot of pain.  By the way, we're doing this to make up for Dustin Diamond.  Yeah, see?  We're paying penance here with staples in our legs.  We understand that we stunk and we had to make it up to you.  Ten sheets of paper?  Dude, this is going to hurt so bad.  And I want to enjoy watching it.  Let's do it.  I don't know if I can do this.  The pain is exquisite.  I didn't think you were going to do it.  I didn't either.  I'll tell you what I was really going for.  I was trying to make you look like more of a pussy than you were. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  Like, see what happens?  There's no way you'll do it, right?  If I do this?  I might.  I might.  Look, I'm shaking.  All right.  Look at it.  It's nothing.  There's no paper left.  There's nothing.  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  Are you doing it?  Are you doing it?  Where did you do it?  Dude.  On you.  Oh, jeez.  You can't tell where I'm bleeding from.  Where?  Right here?  Yeah.  Right on top.  Put it on.  And hit it. 
[01:59:30]  And expect.  It's going to hurt so bad.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch this.  Do it.  Do it.  Watch this.  Do it.  Do it.  No.  Do it.  All right.  Hold on.  It hurts so bad.  It's like jumping from a really high place.  Do it.  Go for it.  Come on.  It hurts really bad, dude.  Come on.  Expect it to really hurt this time.  Quick. 
[02:00:00]  Quick.  He's running out of the studio.  He's limping.  Dude, I know that hurts so bad, man.  That stings so bad.  So bad.  Right?  Holy S.  Yeah, that's the limit right there. 
[02:00:30]  Well, bravo, Opie.  You are the true staple in the leg champion.  One, two, three.  Eight sheets left.  No.  No.  There's no talking me into this.  Go to break because I'm going into the bathroom and washing my friggin' leg off.  Come on.  Eight sheets.  Come on.  There is no way I'm doing this.  It stings, but it went away pretty fast.  Sorry.  Come on.  Do the other leg.  Sorry.  Sorry that you lost the case of beer, John.  I am not doing this again. 
[02:01:00]  Do the other leg.  No, because I'm not effing up both legs.  Eight sheets.  Nope.  Pussy.  There's no way I'll do six.  Thank you.  This is for the win.  Look at you.  There's no way I'll do six.  There's no way I'll do six.  No way.  This is for the win, Anthony.  No.  I cannot.  For the win.  I cannot.  For the win.  Hey, he whose leg has not a staple hole in it, shut up with your bunk, bunk, bunk.  For the win.  Chicken noise.  For the win.  No.  For the win.  You won, Opie.  I graciously. 
[02:01:30]  There's no way I can accept defeat.  Hey, look.  There's no way I can do six.  I take my hand off to you, sir, as Mike Tyson said.  I take my hand off to you.  I want a rematch, though.  What do you think?  No.  Do it.  There is no way.  Just do it.  It really is stinging.  I know.  It stings.  It stings.  It stings.  It stings.  What do you think?  There's a reason it stings.  It's not supposed to happen.  Eight sheets left, Ant.  No.  One.  Two.  Three. 
[02:02:00]  Four.  No.  He's stinking.  I see you.  The same guy that just wrote, Ant, you the man, is now writing, Ant, what a pussy.  These frigging people.  Ant, this is definitely for the victory.  Do it.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  No.  For the victory.  Ant, what a girl.  Isolate that clip.  I'm bleeding through my pants.  No, because I feel it still.  And actually, I think I feel stuff dripping.  I'm not doing this again. 
[02:02:30]  Come on.  Come on.  No, I lost.  You're going to let down our fans.  You know something?  You're going to let them down.  But the people that were rooting for you are really happy, and there's no way I'm doing it.  You're going to let them down.  Look, Ant, look.  Come on.  Just go to another place.  No.  No.  You already won the softball game.  You've got to win this.  You've got to win something.  I am winning in life.  That's how I feel.  That's how I feel.  Come on, Ant.  I'm a winner.  Come on.  I'm a winner.  It awaits you.  Look, look, look.  It's calling your name. 
[02:03:00]  I am not.  Own it.  Anthony.  I am not.  Come on.  Be the stapler.  Just own it.  Be the stapler.  Just give that grin, scream, and do it.  It's all you.  Oh, he's thinking.  No.  I know he's thinking.  I'm not.  Just take a look.  Just take a look.  Like an Olympic champion.  Do it.  Just take a look.  Do it.  You've trained all your life.  Oh, God.  God.  Damn.  Sorry.  Ow.  Oh, God damn it. 
[02:03:30]  Wow.  Come on, Paul.  It has to be done with no forethought.  But there is no way I'm doing this again.  Wow.  I might have to give you the victory.  I want to curse so bad.  I want to give you the victory.  Let me just.  There are.  Do it.  Do it.  I can't let it beat you like this.  There are one, two, three.  Let me see.  Wow. 
[02:04:00]  I'm a mess.  I'm a mess.  Let me see yours.  Well, I'd have to.  I can't.  I can't pull it up like you.  See?  Well, do something.  I'll show you during break.  Do it.  There you go.  And now you know how much this hurts.  I can't.  Now I can't even walk.  I'm a cripple.  Go to a different place.  Oh.  I don't know.  Own it.  Come on.  It is real bad.  Oh, God, no.  Come on.  Oh, God. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He was just ready to do it.  See, you've got to use that no thinking technique and just grab it, plaster it on, and squeeze.  Okay.  Come on.  Do it.  What are you waiting for?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, yes.  Squeeze.  Squeeze.  Here we go.  The pain is real bad.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it, Nicky.  Do it.  Do it, Nicky. 
[02:05:00]  Do it.  Show these mother.  Do it, Nicky.  Oh, God.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Oh, God.  His hand got pinched in the stapler.  You are a mess.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  He's drooling.  He's drooling in pain.  All right, look. 
[02:05:30]  No, no.  Let's make a deal.  Again.  What?  I win, you lose.  Oh, yeah.  That's a fine deal.  I wanted that three shots ago.  You can't let him win like that, dude.  Shut up, Rick.  One.  Go ahead.  You do it.  Two, three.  Four sheets left.  No, now we're just down to we just did the staple bit.  And we, you know.  I think it broke my finger.  What is a couple of sheets of newspaper?  It's not helping.  And I shant.  And I am saying this with the utmost sincerity. 
[02:06:00]  At this point, you might as well.  Because look, now it's just four sheets of nothing.  And it was six when I did it.  Actually, it was eight when I did it.  I did six.  Very proud of you.  I'm too better.  I'm too better.  You are two more gooder, Opie.  And let it be written.  And let it just go in history.  Because that's it.  Cleveland's saying don't let Opie win.  I don't care, Cleveland.  All right.  We'll put you on the clock.  Yeah, come on.  You got 60 seconds. 
[02:06:30]  I'm not.  You know something?  I'm not even considering it this time.  60 seconds.  Why not?  Because this laundering isn't even going to help these pants now.  50 seconds.  Don't worry about it then.  You're worried about the pants being ruined?  No, the leg under it.  Oh, okay.  Looks like Omaha Beach.  You have 40 seconds.  No.  Just do it.  No.  I am not doing it again.  Just do it.  No.  You have 30 seconds to decide.  No.  Come on.  Meow.  Meow.  Here we go.  For 30 seconds. 
[02:07:00]  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  I'm just thinking at this point you've got to do it, though.  It's only four seconds.  You already know what it's going to feel like.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Yeah.  I know what it feels like.  Because now it isn't even just the pain.  Now I'm just worried about some permanent injury.  What do you say?  Five seconds.  No.  Come on.  Four.  Opie, you wait.  Two.  Come on.  Just grab it and do it.  Opie is the winner.  Very good.  I didn't think you were going to go for that last one. 
[02:07:30]  I will take a victory staple for the team.  Stop it.  Oh.  No.  No way.  No way you're putting a staple in your leg.  No way.  No newspaper.  Nothing.  No way.  No way.  What the?  What are you, nuts?  Do it.  This is for the victory.  No way.  It's empty.  No way.  Why?  Come on.  Push it down.  Push it down.  Stop it.  There's no pressure.  No way.  There you go.  You do it, Rick.  Now you're talking.  You do it, Rick.  This is for just... 
[02:08:00]  Giggles.  It takes a lot, right?  Yeah.  You got to just, like...  All right.  Oh, you squeeze in the head.  You squeeze it.  It's almost there at that top point.  Okay.  Oh.  Almost had it there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You take that breath and just...  Bam.  Girl it in. 
[02:08:30]  Bam.  Oh, God.  Pull it out.  Bam.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Ow.  Oh, you're...  Dude, you are so red.  Oh, gosh.  Okay.  You are so red.  I almost passed out.  You put stapes in your legs till you pass out. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  Holy ass.  That...  That hurt.  That hurt, Ant.  We're going to break now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am...  I am beelining it to the bathroom.  We're going to break now.  Yeah.  Let me lick that off.  Not with third eye blind after a show.  And suddenly they announce that they're ready to...  WNEW.  You're in the end of the show.  23 skidoo.  I want a girl with a mind like a diamond. 
[02:09:30]  I want a girl who knows what's best.  I want a girl with shoes that cut and eyes that burn like cigarettes.  I want a girl with the right allocations who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack.  She's playing with her jewelry.  She's putting up her hair.  She's doing the facility and picking up slack. 
[02:10:00]  I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  In the studio, Paul Mercurio.  Hey, guys.  From the Daily Show, of course, on Comedy Central.  If you're not in New York and you want to get a hold of us, 866-2774.  Wow.  Paul, you've got to bear with me. 
[02:10:30]  I've got to give someone some really bad news right now.  No problem.  I think they're on the phone here.  You can help me out if you like.  Good night.  Did you hear about Maureen Reagan?  No.  I didn't know.  Ronald Reagan's daughter?  Yeah.  She passed away today.  Really?  And I do believe someone has no clue.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello.  President Reagan.  Hello.  President Reagan.  Where?  No, sir.  That's you.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm who? 
[02:11:00]  You're the former president of the United States of America.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Hello, my fellow Americans.  Let me tell you.  Libyan madman, Muammar Gaddafi, cannot continue his reign of terror.  Um, sir?  Yes.  He's not really a threat anymore.  Who?  Uh, Gaddafi.  Who?  Uh, Gaddafi.  Yes.  He's...  As I was saying.  He's not a threat anymore.  No, he's...  The Ayatollah Khomeini. 
[02:11:30]  You let those hostages go.  I think he's dead.  Yes, sir.  Because we'll...  Sir, he's dead.  I want...  Who?  Ronald Reagan.  No, no, you're...  He died.  He was a fine American president.  No, no, no, sir.  He will be missed by me.  No, no, sir.  That's you.  Who am I?  You're alive.  Yes.  You're the president.  The former president.  I am.  Getting me confused now.  How come I don't get to fly in the big plane anymore?  Close your eyes.  Mommy, get me an ice cream cone.  Hello?  Yeah, it's your...  Why are you calling?  It's your old friends, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:00]  You remember us, right?  We call you from time to time?  Amos and Andy.  No.  It was a fine show.  No, Opie and Anthony.  With a nice colored man.  And we have Paul McCurio in the studio.  I use McCurichrome when I cut myself.  Oh, sir.  No, Mr. McCurichrome.  The fine thing that fights in contusions.  No, no, no.  Hello?  Sir?  Yes?  Are you sitting down?  Freddie Mercury was a great singer.  Freddie Mercury?  And...  You listen to Freddie...  Is he in the studio?  No, no.  That's Paul McCurio. 
[02:12:30]  McCurio?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry to hear about your AIDS.  No.  Hello?  Paul does not have AIDS, sir.  No.  That's nice.  Paul is the walrus.  Yes.  Are you sitting down, sir?  I'm a little...  I don't know.  We have some sad news for you today.  Sad news?  Yes.  Your daughter passed away.  Oh, my God.  Maureen Reagan?  Maureen McCormick.  No, no, no.  She was an inspiration playing that young woman, Marsha Brady. 
[02:13:00]  What's your last name, sir?  And she will be missed.  She was quite a...  No, sir.  Yes.  Maureen Reagan, your daughter.  Maureen Reagan.  She passed away today of skin cancer at the age of 60.  Oh, my God.  You outlived your daughter, sir.  I remember once telling her, Maureen Reagan, tear down that wall.  No, no, no.  I think you said that to me.  It finally happened.  Well, years later, the Iron Curtain fell, and now we can all...  Yes?  Hello?  Sir, do you have photos of your family nearby? 
[02:13:30]  Photos of my family?  Yeah.  The only member of my family I see is that big-headed monster Nancy.  She's right there.  Would someone please get her away?  She frightens me.  No, she's right there, and she's taking care of you, sir.  Look, I'm a pincushion, and my brain is flowers.  Hello?  Yes.  I'm a television set, and my mind goes boom, boom.  Sir, we've got to try this again, sir.  You have to understand, your daughter...  Nancy looks like a Mardi Gras float.  No. 
[02:14:00]  She's frightening.  I...  Well, sometimes I...  That should...  I bend her head back and expect Pez to come out.  No, sir, that's...  That woman is...  She frightens me.  No, she's a...  She's an Alzheimer's carrier.  Because when you look at her, my God, you want to forget the image.  Sir, she's...  Yes.  She's a saint.  She's taking care of you.  Right now.  She looks like a Q-tip dip in Mercura...  No, it's me.  ...all Mercurochrome.  She's helping you out in the twilight of your life, sir. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, you think so.  Yes, I do.  You try living with that freak show.  She looks like one of those big Garfield balloons they use in parades.  It's just her head.  And the rest of her, my God, you...  You want to bed down with that white cauliflower ass every night.  You pray for Alzheimer's to take your memory away.  Memories of, well, starlets in the 40s and 50s.  I was banging them while you were still banging cheerleaders. 
[02:15:00]  It seems like you're remembering a lot, Mr. Reagan.  I fake the Alzheimer's.  It's a clever ruse to not have to talk to Nancy.  I'm sharp as a effing cat.  How do you feel about your daughter, Maureen?  She was a twat.  No, she's a twat.  I don't care if she's dead.  Sir, she just died.  I wish all my kids were dying.  Right down in that little faggot son I got. 
[02:15:30]  Well, he has a low T-cell count.  And he's got my name, Ron Reagan Jr.  Yes, he does.  You know what I used to call Ron Reagan Jr.?  Huh?  What I used to put inside starlets.  Old Ron Reagan Jr.  How were you more in the passing of your daughter, sir?  I could give a flying hit.  I'm just going to celebrate when Nancy leaves.  She goes to pick up more Alzheimer's medication.  It's party time. 
[02:16:00]  This is an explosive.  Oh, wait, here she comes.  Hold on.  Hold on, boys.  Hold on.  Okay.  Yes, Mommy.  Hello.  No, I want to play on the sit and spin.  Look, Mommy, I'm a whoopee cushion.  Yes, okay.  More ice cream, Mommy.  Thank you.  Tell her the can of soup is actually a telephone.  She's gone.  When can that bitch die?  I fooled her great the other day.  The phone rang, and I answered the toaster. 
[02:16:30]  You answered the toaster?  That's a hot one.  She went for that one, huh?  She starts crying.  Yeah.  Are you walking on water these days?  I'll do anything.  I don't care.  As long as she thinks I'm crazy.  Are you riding horses on the ranch?  No.  I talk to them in front of Nancy.  What a pisser.  And she leaves town, and I invite Gerald Ford over, and we talk about the good old days  when we used to bang strippers. 
[02:17:00]  Wonderful old times before that came into my life.  Does he bring wife Betty over?  Teddy brings the chicks.  If he doesn't kill them, the stupid son of a bitch.  All right.  Listen.  President Reagan, we're going to let you go, okay?  Okay.  And I knew about Maureen, and I could give a crap.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait, Nancy's coming.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look, Mommy.  I'm eating the phone. 
[02:17:30]  Take it easy, boys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, Mommy.  There he goes.  Wow.  That's an exclusive, Paul.  We talk to him a lot, and that's the first time he has admitted to us that he doesn't  really have the Alzheimer's.  And he sounds broken up about Maureen.  Yeah.  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:00]  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[02:18:30]  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  Irene.  Yeah?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me is that I want to know something.  Hi, Irene.  How come you're politically incorrect with some people, which is okay, but some other  people, you're scared, and you step on people, you act like you're on eggshells.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Please explain.  Why is that? 
[02:19:00]  Please explain.  Well, for instance, certain ethnic groups, you don't give a damn how you degrade them.  Be blunt.  Be blunt.  But the other ones.  And say what you mean.  What ethnic groups?  Okay.  Be very plain and clear here.  The black people, you seem to get very frightened of offending them.  They kill people.  I'm afraid of offending black people.  What are you talking about?  Yes, you are.  You're absolutely right.  No?  We aren't afraid of an event.  Okay, and why are you specializing in some soft porn crap?  I mean, what are you doing?  You're catering to the jerks of this country, and that's how you make your salary? 
[02:19:30]  What are you talking about?  Yes.  What is wrong with you?  What are you talking about?  People don't act like you.  Go out on the street.  Why don't you get to the point of what you're saying?  People sell drugs on the street.  Irene, how come you're specializing in this soft porn crap?  What soft porn?  How fat are you, Cher concert goer?  How fat are you?  Oh, not fat I am.  That you don't like making women.  Yes.  A 125 pounds.  Really?  Then you must have a ugly mug.  Long red hair.  Oh, good.  Irene.  It's not hot red either.  Beautiful, big, green eyes.  Irene, can I ask you this?  Who the hell cares?  Let me ask you, Irene.  The thing is that you specialize in soft porn. 
[02:20:00]  You specialize in the low elements of people.  Irene, can I ask you something?  And you love it.  Irene.  I'm 35 to 40 years old.  God, I've got to ask Irene something, but she won't listen.  Irene.  Irene, how did you get to know this show?  I listen to it sometimes.  Why?  Because sometimes.  Why?  You know why?  Why?  Sometimes you're funny.  All right.  Then you lose it.  Well, you don't.  You lose it.  You don't appreciate the girls that come in and what you call the soft porn. 
[02:20:30]  Well, that's part of us and part of our show.  And there are two women who are mentally deranged, who obviously don't have any self-esteem.  Three now.  You just degrade them to hell.  Oh, we rip them apart.  What the hell is wrong with them?  You are a sad, sad woman.  We rip them apart.  You are the saddest woman.  No, I'm not a sad woman.  I'm a smart one.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  You're obsessed with this show, and it pisses you off, and you love being pissed, so you keep  coming back.  And I think that sometimes you're funny. 
[02:21:00]  I love to laugh.  And I think that sometimes you're intelligent, but you really go out of your way to degrade  people.  Who's your thing?  And you don't.  All right.  You don't.  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality am I?  I don't think it's important.  Why not?  You're talking about nationality, you stupid, dishonest coward.  Speak to me.  Tell us the truth.  What nationality are you?  You degrade.  Shut your lying face, dummy.  What are you, a racist?  You're very nervous that you don't offend certain groups.  You're absolutely wrong.  If you're going to be politically incorrect, be politically incorrect to everybody. 
[02:21:30]  You are an insane, you're a dishonest, you're probably a real racist, and we're joking.  What ethnic group are you a member of, stupid?  F*** you, you stupid.  Oh, that's right, you white trash whore.  That's right, whatever you are, use your dirty language, you filthy-mouthed, poorly-raised  hooker.  You know, I used to work there.  Fifth Avenue, sucking you to a work for money.  Don't tell me, don't tell me anything.  I'm 50 years old.  Exactly, you aging meat bag with one breast. 
[02:22:00]  You act like 12.  50 years old.  And I don't know, you don't know?  We like acting 12.  And we like young women.  Did she say she used to work?  Young women with firm, firm breasts.  Boom.  Did she say she used to work here?  Because the teenagers are a bunch of suck-ass jerks.  That's right.  And you know.  You filthy-mouthed senior citizen.  Thank him for that.  That's a nice language for a grandmother, you old bag of meat.  Nice language for an old lady.  Irene, you used to work here? 
[02:22:30]  She hung up.  Typical of a hole like that.  Hang up.  I don't think she was white.  She didn't sound white.  Whatever she was, why don't you offend black people?  What are you talking about?  Shut up, stupid.  I hate old, deluded people.  You 50-year-old, one-breasted bag of meat.  Just hang it up and be grateful that some of your friends are still living.  If that exchange isn't worthy of a Jim Norton promo, I don't know what is.  I saw Steve going, yeah.  I hate people that don't tell the truth.  Be honest about where you're coming from.  I thought she was endearing. 
[02:23:00]  Dude, she was an old pig.  I don't like Jim Norton.  I don't think he's funny.  I don't like Opie and Anthony.  All right, you accept that because it's an honest point of view.  But when you're coming from like this, I hate the fact that my youth is gone.  And I listen sometimes, like Anthony pointed out.  I like to be mad.  Just be honest that you like to be angry, so that's why you listen.  I hate liars.  She enjoys listening to get angry.  Dude, people don't think the show is funny.  I accept that.  That's a taste judgment call fine.  But just stop being so...  And then she's going, you effing...  Exactly.  Show your true colors, you uneducated, ancient pig. 
[02:23:30]  You cryptic, filthy-mouthed old grandmother with no love left in your one-breasted life.  I'm 125 pounds.  And she doesn't have hot red hair.  It's probably orange with green eyes.  Boy, that's really sexy.  You glow-in-the-dark bag of pig meat.  Bright green eyes and red hair.  Do you have any primary colors?  That bozo hair.  That bozo color.  Big red, awful orange hair.  That's really sexy.  I want to put my mule into a sun kiss with two little emeralds staring out of it. 
[02:24:00]  Just big, beautiful green eyes.  Men never care about your eyes.  We don't care, ladies.  We just don't care about your eyes.  I like them.  I love them.  I don't care about them.  See, because you don't look at the person as a human, man.  No, I like a human.  You look at them as an object.  I think...  I swear to you, the eyes are the best picture on a woman.  No one likes eyes just sealing them shut with his seed.  Yeah, they're not the best thing on a woman.  You're sick if you don't look at eyes. 
[02:24:30]  Dude, I look at them when I have to, when I'm apologizing the next morning, but I don't  like to stare at them.  Because usually they're crying.  Maybe that's it.  Do you understand what I mean about that person?  Absolutely.  That's what makes me so angry.  So just be honest about why you don't like somebody.  Don't try to be clever and pseudo-manipulative.  Just tell the truth.  What you don't like gets to the point.  That's soft core stuff to do.  I just hate that.  Just a jealous old lady.  She really, really taps into rage.  We didn't get on the blacks enough for some reason.  That really annoys me. 
[02:25:00]  Like, what do you want us to say about black people?  We goof on everybody, but you don't want to be vicious.  You want blacklisters and whitelisters, and that's not being politically correct, stupid.  I just want to bang women of all races, so I don't want to alienate anybody.  Creepy old racist whore.  Irene's calling back.  Irene, what's wrong now?  No, I just want to tell you that I'm no old hag.  If you passed me on the street, you wouldn't recognize me.  I got a call.  Number one, tell that guy that I'm no old hag.  And what if I was?  For what?  Would that make me less of a person? 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  No, it would not.  You see, you're so mainstream.  You're trying to be so cool, but you're mainstream America.  Yeah.  So what the hell are you talking about?  You don't think there's any old, good-looking, sexy people?  You sound like the chick from Midnight Cowboy.  You were going to ask me for money?  I'm so sad with that.  You don't have no idea.  I'm a sexy chick.  Can an old lady yell like this?  She wouldn't have the energy.  It's not the fact that you might be a girl.  Yes, I used to work there.  It's not your age that I care about.  It's your thinking.  It's your mentality.  I don't care how old you are.  No, my mentality is this.  Can you let me finish a sentence? 
[02:26:00]  I let you finish.  You let me finish.  That was what bothered me.  It wasn't the fact that you might be 50.  I don't care.  I'd have sex with a 50-year-old woman like yourself.  I mean, I'd probably feed you maybe some, pull your diapers off and enjoy you.  I'm not saying that your age doesn't bother me.  Right.  No, I'll tell you what bothers me.  You degrade people at this station.  I don't like the full porn.  You want us to degrade black people.  And I want to know what kind of teenager you have to cater to to get ratings.  Why can't you be intelligent?  Irene.  The black, funny people that you are.  You let it out with the crap. 
[02:26:30]  Irene.  You want to degrade black people.  And she is black.  Irene.  Irene, if I could.  Because they loved it.  That's right.  You're right.  If you want to bring up.  Why do they love it?  Why do you have to feed into it?  If you want to bring up ratings, we do very well in the ratings with people that are a  lot older than their teens, Irene.  That's probably their parents.  Well, whatever.  The point is, is that why can't you be funny and intelligent without being disgusting and  degrading?  So you know what's funny and entertaining to everybody else. 
[02:27:00]  People are stupid.  Young people are stupid.  See, you arrogant old bitch.  You know it deep inside.  She is so jealous of you.  She's jealous of you.  Young people.  You jealous old angry leaders.  I am not old.  I used to be a young person just ten years ago.  When I was younger, I didn't do this.  You are an ass, Irene.  You are an ass.  My mother.  Hey, stop.  You're being disgusting now.  Stop trying to be clever.  What kind of dignified senior citizen are you? 
[02:27:30]  I'm not a senior citizen.  Shut up, stupid.  There she goes again.  See?  How easy you are.  With your dirty mouth.  With your potty mouth.  With your potty mouth.  With me to come to 8887th Avenue, my old digs.  With your potty mouth.  I used to work there.  What did you do?  You're so easy to make man.  What?  Did you work here at the station?  Doing what?  You old bag.  You stupid jerky.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, potty mouth.  Wow.  Stop the cursing.  Irene, did you work at this station? 
[02:28:00]  No.  I worked in the building.  Oh, what happened?  You got fired?  Mandatory retirement?  No, I quit.  I worked at a public relations firm.  Oh, Jesus.  You must have been great there.  Why did you quit?  Too many young, happy people?  No, I mean...  This was 20 years ago before the computer came out.  You're ancient.  Damn that computer.  That infernal device.  You want to see how ancient I am?  If you saw me, you would have believed it.  Yeah, blame the computer.  Yeah, big deal.  I'm putting a lot of people.  So what if I'm...  Everyone knows when a secretary hits 40, you've got to get rid of them.  Two, I've seen plenty of gorgeous 60-year-olds. 
[02:28:30]  Look at Loretta Young before she died.  You were going to ask me for money?  Do you see Loretta Young?  Do you know that Ursula Andress is 65 years old?  Exactly.  And she's hot.  Would you protect Ursula Andress?  No, I wouldn't.  You are bad.  But she's not an obnoxious, potty mouth, jealous old lady.  You are.  I am not a jealous old lady.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You've never even seen me, you jerk.  Irene, take your teeth out.  All right, Irene.  Gum me.  You don't know who I am.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene, Irene, Irene, Irene, Irene. 
[02:29:00]  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Irene, Irene, we want you down here in the studio.  Why?  We want to take a look at you.  If I'm wrong, I apologize.  No, I don't think it would be mentally healthy for me.  Why?  You've got mental problems.  Because I don't like the way you operate.  I don't like the soft porn.  Irene, what kind of medication are you on?  Be honest.  You're on antidepressants, right?  I should.  My boyfriend died on my bathroom floor between three years ago.  You see what I mean?  Do you see what I mean? 
[02:29:30]  You see what I mean?  This entire home comes down.  Oh, God.  Why are you laughing?  No, no, no, no, no, really.  Why are you laughing?  Irene, I agree.  Stop that anymore.  I want to know why you're laughing.  Irene, I agree.  Tell me why you're laughing.  No, no, no.  What happened?  I'm sorry.  That ain't cool.  That ain't cool.  I didn't say you're sorry.  What happened?  And that's all you have to say.  I'm sorry.  I didn't do it.  What happened?  What happened?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Why would you say you're sorry?  What happened?  Hold on, Irene.  Yes.  What happened?  I'm not feeling too good about myself, and I apologize.  Apology taken.  So what happened in the bathroom?  What happened, Irene, in the bathroom? 
[02:30:00]  He died of heart failure.  What?  What are you doing?  He died of what?  Right?  Is that laughter in the background?  He died of what?  No.  I wanted that laughter in the background stopped.  He was a great guy.  He was a wonderful, cool guy.  You would love him if you knew him.  But, Irene, what happened on that bathroom floor?  What did he die of?  Heart failure.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
[02:30:30]  See what I mean?  You see what I mean?  You see what I mean?  Apologize.  Apologize.  That's why I won't come down.  Apologize.  Irene, listen.  This is Opie.  I apologize for Anthony.  Anthony's a son of a bitch.  He's had a tough, tough year or two.  I don't care about me.  I apologize about my boyfriend making fun of the people who died.  That's all.  He's not going to hear the apology.  Yes, he is.  I believe in life after death.  Yeah, but he's taking a dirt nap.  Yeah, he's rotting somewhere. 
[02:31:00]  Don't worry about it.  He's not rotting.  There is an afterlife.  He's fully alive and he's listening to you.  He's not.  He is.  Why do you have a vested interest in not believing in the afterlife?  When do you think his jaw dropped?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  He went bye-bye in the box.  I could show you pictures of him that would put you to shame.  He was a gorgeous guy and he's still alive.  He's still alive.  He crossed over.  He's still alive.  Shots and he's still alive.  How long were you dating Virgil Sollozzo? 
[02:31:30]  30 years.  30 years.  30 years.  Why didn't he marry you?  Wait, I want to hear the story.  This is very strange, you idiot.  Why are you doing this?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right.  30 years.  Hold on, Irene.  So what happened?  He went into the bathroom to take a, what, a bath?  No, no.  I came home one day and he said, he was in bed, and he said, I said, what's wrong?  And it was 6 o'clock.  He said, oh, I think I have the flu.  Oh.  I said, oh, you know, like I was like, you know, I said, okay.  So I just went about my business, which is, and then. 
[02:32:00]  Are you feeling guilty that you didn't bring him to a hospital at that point?  I don't feel guilty about anything.  I mean, about that dying?  I had nothing to do with it.  No, no, about not bringing him to the hospital.  Maybe you should have taken him to the hospital and said he was sick.  Oh, yeah, there was talk of that.  And I thought it was the flu.  There was no clutching of the chest or a pain or anything.  So we thought he had the flu.  So he was even, like, getting up and going to the refrigerator now and then.  Yeah.  He did keep going to the bathroom.  So I figured, gee, he must have a virus.  Right.  2 o'clock in the morning, I'm woken up, and my, his uncle was living with us. 
[02:32:30]  You know, his uncle didn't, never married.  Right.  Why, why, this gay guy?  And I said, what noise?  He said, I heard somebody, a commotion in the bathroom.  And then I heard some guy say, help me, help me.  Oh, no.  And I said, I went there, and I still thought it was the flu.  And I go in there, and I say, what's wrong?  Yeah.  And he says, he couldn't answer me.  And so we moved him, but it was like moving dead meat.  Oh, boy.  So I called the ambulance, and I saw him sit up, look straight ahead of me as if he was looking at something. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And there was no pain.  There was no screaming.  There was no yelling.  There was no clutching of the chest.  And he said, I'll be all right.  I'm going to be all right.  I said, oh, yeah?  Oh, that's great.  So I turned my back, called the ambulance.  Ambulance came, one, two, three, didn't let us see anything, put us in the police car to drive us to the hospital.  Yeah.  And the police car wasn't moving, and then they came back and said, that's it.  He's finished. 
[02:33:30]  Do you think that's funny?  Can I have an apology?  Can I have an apology?  Can I have an apology?  Oh, yeah.  Can I have an apology?  Yeah, we make it okay by just apologizing.  Oh, Irene, I'm really sorry.  I am sorry.  Okay, okay.  We're obviously going for a cheap laugh.  Yeah.  So, sorry.  Okay, but the point is, is that I don't like your self-porn.  I don't know why you degrade. 
[02:34:00]  You know what?  You're actually right.  And you know what I don't like?  I think I know why you do it, because nobody would be listening to me.  Irene, you're right.  You're right.  You know what?  I don't like annoying, lazy girlfriends who tell their boyfriends to go back to bed when they're having heart pain.  She wasn't having heart pain.  My God.  See the signs next time.  What?  Yeah, maybe if you weren't thinking about your beauty, she'd have to rush them to the hospital.  There was no heart pain.  There was no pain at all.  You're feeling guilt, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  Why don't you talk to John Edwards? 
[02:34:30]  John Edwards?  I watched him.  He's wonderful.  Maybe he can put you in touch with your boyfriend.  No, no.  I'm not interested in that.  I like Gary Zukos.  Your boyfriend could yell at you for not taking him to the hospital.  Have you ever heard of Gary Zukos?  Gary Zukos?  No.  No, why?  Did he also kill someone he loved by laziness?  What?  Who is he?  Wasn't he the guy that hung around with John Travolta in Greece?  No, no, no.  It was Danny Zuko, right?  Find out who he is.  Oh, I forgot.  The point is, is that he's a great people.  Maybe your husband faked his own death to get away from you.  Yes. 
[02:35:00]  I wish.  I really wish.  Because that would be better than what's now.  You were going to ask me for money?  I'm a very sexy chick.  Oh, no, ma'am.  Here's $20 for a cab.  What?  I know, Sylvia Miles.  You didn't get it.  No, I didn't get it.  Was it your boyfriend or your husband?  Oh, well, it was like a common law.  All right, 30 years and you never put a ring on your finger.  Doesn't that tell you how aggravating you can be?  I told you she was black.  We had a bond where that...  Irene, I know this is going to be... 
[02:35:30]  I wasn't at all...  Irene, I know this is going to be a little uncomfortable for you, but what were his last words to you?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  So you're a Kenny Loggins fan?  What?  What?  I don't understand what you're saying.  He seemed to be looking past me as if he was seeing something.  Probably some softcore porn.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, right.  Probably a hot young chick walking past the ambulance.  No, no, no.  Yeah, right. 
[02:36:00]  That's funny.  He just said, I'm okay.  Yeah.  I feel fine.  I said, oh, that's good.  And I turned around and I'm not psychic at all.  I can't...  I don't have any premonitions of anything.  Right.  You sure don't.  Especially...  I even heard the low-flying plane at the World Trade Center.  It was right there.  Oh.  And I thought it was just a low-flying plane.  I wanted to see.  It was.  It was.  You idiot.  Because I'm fascinated with low-flying planes.  We all are.  Fascinated by low-flying planes.  I think we all are.  Yes.  I have had no premonitions and no psychic ability at all. 
[02:36:30]  Irene, I have a tape of your boyfriend's last words.  No, no, no.  Could you shut up?  Could you shut up?  No, what was...  Quiet.  What was his final words again?  I'm okay.  I'm fine.  I thought it was I'm all right.  You just messed up my...  What's the difference?  What is the difference?  You should remember the last words.  What was it?  It was I'm all right, you said.  I just told you.  I'm all right.  Nobody heard about me. 
[02:37:00]  Why you got to give me a fight?  Why don't you just let me in?  Do what you like.  Do it if you let me in.  Yeah, do what you like.  Go back to bed.  I'm having a heart attack.  Uh, listen.  Listen, morons.  Listen, uh, rating grabber. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, don't shut up.  Shut up.  Uh, uh...  Uh...  Can't wait.  Uh...  Can't wait.  I'm out of a medical alert button, you selfish bag.  I'm falling and I can't get up.  How do you feel?  Do it, do it, do it, do it.  I'm all right.  Hey, low life. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, low life.  Hey, low life.  Hey, low life.  Um...  No life.  Better than no life.  No life.  I want to know something.  Wait.  Who are you trying to please?  The teenagers?  You want to make it entertaining?  Everybody with a live spouse.  I know.  You know what?  You're boring.  You are such a fool.  You just want to be, like, funny. 
[02:38:30]  You think you're so different, but you're so mainstream.  It's not funny.  This has been done before.  Don't you understand?  We're cakes for nothing.  That was the last word.  We're cakes for nothing.  It sure beats falling on the bathroom floor.  I'm hooking up.  So stupid.  Mother f***.  Oh.  The old lady's got a dirty mouth. 
[02:39:00]  Mother effer.  What's that about?  Shut up.  Hey, everyone.  We're all going to get laid. 
[02:39:30]  Old school.  Hey, wait a minute.  You want me there?  You want me there?  I'd love to have it.  What?  I'd love to have it.  I'd love to have it.  I'd love to have it.  Get the hell out of our way.  It's obvious this guy's having a heart attack.  Oh, God. 
[02:40:00]  English?  I'd love to have it.  You're acting like a bunch of stupid assholes in your body.  Apologize.  Here's the boyfriend on the other side.  I'm a little bit in there.  Motherf***ing in there.  Wait, potty mouth.  Hey, motherf***ing in there.  Hey, I'll apologize.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I know what happened.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  They dumped out about three times. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  They're dumping out like crazy.  Yeah, we've got to let the...  Man, you've got to hear this later say...  This lady say the word mother effer.  It is scary when it comes out of her mouth.  Hey, you know what you're...  Irene, do you want me to come down?  Did you stand up in the tub in The Shining and he had a heart attack when he saw you?  Is that what happened?  You want to see?  Uh, no.  You want me to come down?  You want to come down?  You want me?  We'd have you come down.  Then why don't you apologize right now for everything you've done, whether it was necessary  to get ratings or not?  We're not the ones who ignored our loved one.  I didn't ignore anybody. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, you did.  You wanted me to go back to bed.  You're a little tired.  No, what you said doesn't affect me at all.  I just want an apology.  Huddle a huddle.  I want an apology for that little...  No, I won't.  I don't blame you.  I don't want your cigarettes or your cigarettes.  I want my dead fiancé.  Apologize.  What were his last words?  Apologize.  I got him right here.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Wait, do that again, Ed.  I'll play the part of Irene.  All right.  Oh, oh, help me. 
[02:41:30]  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Apologize now.  I don't...  You better apologize.  What's that, sleepyhead?  Hey, don't make fun of no dead people.  We're not making fun of your inability to see that he was dying, stupid.  Oh, please.  That doesn't affect me in the least.  The whole left side of my body shut down.  That doesn't affect me in the least.  I must be a head cold. 
[02:42:00]  You are a fool.  You are a fool.  I mean a flesh wound.  Hey, ugly.  Ugly.  Ugly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would not...  I knew that would...  Sweet, merciful crap.  You're right.  I am ugly.  It looks for everything to you.  I knew that would get your attention.  Well, I'd hate to look like bones in a box.  Yeah.  Apologize.  All right.  I'm sorry you had no ability to act when someone you love dated you.  Um, I just want an apology.  That was good.  That's what you just did.  Is the boyfriend.  What the hell were you seeing? 
[02:42:30]  I have no trust and no regrets about that night.  Just apologize for what you just did.  No guilt at all, huh?  Hey, Sleeping Beauty needs an apology.  Would you give it to her?  Yes, I need it.  The prince should have put nitroglycerin under your tongue to watch it.  Hey, uh, Mr. Comedian, uh, I never heard of you, but, uh, shut up.  Of course you didn't hear about me.  You're too busy sleeping and going to wigs.  Sleeping and going to wigs?  Ow!  Here he is.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Apologize!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[02:43:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I don't care what you think, you're not even a person.  Huddle-a, huddle-a.  You're not even a person.  I am so a person.  I am so a person.  Yeah, Jim, you're awful.  He is.  It was Jim that was pushing all those buttons.  Who the hell are you kidding me anyway?  I apologize.  Jim, Jim hides behind his button-pushing ability.  I'm a button-pushing punk.  Here's Irene right, uh, as she knelt over him in the bathroom.  You can act like a man! 
[02:43:30]  What's the matter with you?  Listen, I need a job.  What did the EMS worker say, excuse me, ma'am, but your bath mat is talking?  Yeah, this is getting boring.  Yeah.  Why don't you hang up?  It couldn't be more boring than that lonely apartment.  Lonely, empty bed.  All right.  Uh, Irene, we're, uh, we're, uh, we're, uh, we're out of time.  Look, I just wanted, I think that you grade people like those two women who come there.  Those two women who are non-ploralizing murderers? 
[02:44:00]  Why do you have, why do you deal with such, with folk porn?  Because I think it's disgusting.  I don't like the folk porn.  Those two women.  I don't like, I don't like you degrading people.  You know, they're kind of women.  I don't like you degrading those two women.  Irene.  They're idiots, I know.  Irene.  But why do you degrade them?  Irene, we gotta go, we gotta go.  We have to go.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  We're just hanging up on you, okay?  Uh, the ambulance worker sounded like he, uh, he had some hope here at the end.  We're gonna get through this, so I just gotta keep your chin up.  Oh, let's just stick with me, and then we'll turn this thing around. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Oh, my stomach hurts.  Jesus Christ.  I love you.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  I got nothing else.  Jesus.  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  If you're happy and you know it, clench your chest.
