<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a jarring montage depicting the hosts as "Radio Shock Jocks" and a bizarre, unexplained scene of a masked man and someone being paddled.  The show immediately dives into a critique of New York City's inaccurate weather forecasts, speculating that news stations inflate storm predictions for higher ratings.  This leads to a discussion of their own weather forecasting prowess, punctuated by calls from listeners in Connecticut and Boston, highlighting the disparity in snowfall across the region.  Comedian Patrice O’Neal is a guest in the studio, his presence partly due to concerns about Anthony’s potential travel delays from the nonexistent snowstorm.

Jimmy then dominates a significant portion of the show, detailing his Atlantic City trip to see Diana Ross, despite the predicted blizzard.  This segues into a discussion of his troubled relationship, complete with graphic details of their arguments and communication breakdowns.  This personal revelation is followed by a bizarre account of a dream involving a threesome with his girlfriend and Tom Chiasano, the station's general manager. The hosts react with graphic humor and speculation, leading to a discussion of cuckoldry and Jimmy's newfound interest in cuckolding-themed films.

Anthony then recounts his high-stakes gambling weekend at Mohegan Sun, detailing significant wins and losses, a turbulent flight, and observations of casino practices. The conversation touches on "coolers"—dealers suspected of manipulating games—high-roller tables, and betting strategies.  Anthony openly admits his gambling addiction, stating he’ll continue regardless of the financial consequences.  The segment concludes with a parody of Roger Clemens admitting to steroid use.

A subsequent segment focuses on a heated discussion about blackjack strategy and the frustration caused by inept players. Anthony recounts a casino experience where a particularly bad player followed him to multiple tables, culminating in a significant loss from his personal funds, before a lucky turnaround.  He uses copious expletives to express his frustration, detailing his emotional rollercoaster and even a physical altercation with a fellow gambler, Keith.  Callers weigh in on blackjack etiquette, the impact of poor players, and even Anthony’s volatile behavior, with one caller, a psychologist named Lydia, expressing concern about his agitation.  The discussion eventually shifts to the inaccurate snowstorm prediction, the Dallas Cowboys' loss, and Tony Romo's trip to Mexico with Jessica Simpson.  A caller boasts about his father, Dave Waddle, a gold medal-winning runner, having sex with his mother the night before a race.  T.O.'s crying audio is also played.

Another segment begins by mocking the exaggerated weather reports and transitions to Terrell Owens' crying audio after a football game loss.  This leads to insensitive jokes about a child with a rare condition preventing her from feeling pain, followed by a discussion of a news story about a father sodomizing his stepson. A caller recounts a Patrice O’Neal stand-up show incident involving a heckling couple. The hosts then mock the meager single bouquet of roses sent to the show by FTD, before discussing their show business friendships.  The segment briefly mentions two starving horses named Opie and Anthony, and a scientific breakthrough concerning a rat's heart. Patrice O’Neal remains a guest in the studio throughout this portion.

A rambling discussion follows, beginning cryptically with roses, before transitioning to a couple's relationship problems and a news story about a hidden camera in an RV park bathroom. This sparks discussions about privacy and the hosts' own anxieties about showering in public.  The show then promotes a bizarre event called "Couples Cherry Darts," involving throwing cherries at gay couples' anuses.  This is followed by a movie review segment covering various films, including "No Country for Old Men," "There Will Be Blood," and others, with sexually explicit and offensive commentary throughout.  The segment concludes with a discussion of Dave's firing from the Ron and Fez show for allegedly smashing another host's face into a pizza, interwoven with more sexually explicit humor about the Carpenters.

The final segment devolves into a vulgar and offensive discussion of Karen Carpenter's anorexia and death, filled with derogatory terms and insensitive jokes. The hosts and callers repeatedly make light of her illness and physical deterioration, playing a Sonic Youth cover of a Carpenters song as a backdrop.  The discussion includes numerous crude jokes, non-sequiturs, and mocking commentary about a coworker's appearance.  A recurring joke involves Mama Cass and Karen Carpenter sharing a sandwich, and the segment concludes with the Sonic Youth song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Ass mask on.  His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh my God. 
[00:01:00]  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this coming?  I got sick.  Freaks.  One, two, three.  Go.  B-Rock is attempting.  Give us a thumbs up if you're alright.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We got to get right to it today.  Oh.  Did everybody make it in okay? 
[00:01:30]  I'm amazed you're here, Anthony.  I thought for sure you'd be in horrible, horrible snow traffic.  Oh my God.  It was so hard to make it in from Long Island.  I left at one in the morning to make sure the snow wouldn't keep me.  And just in case you didn't make it or Jimmy didn't make it, we invited Patrice O'Neal in.  He's here.  Everyone made it in.  But boy, what a tough commute this morning to get here to broadcast for you all.  Between the plows and the snow and the ice. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, was that tough.  Wow.  Wow.  Good morning.  Man, did we get dumped on here in New York.  Emails going back and forth all night long.  Are you going to make it?  Maybe you should get a hotel in the city.  Maybe we all should prepare for this big snowstorm in New York City.  A foot.  They were like, a foot.  A foot at least.  At least a foot.  Oh, boy.  I'm getting the panicky Steve texts.  Because I was at Mohegan Sun. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  So as I'm at the casino, I'm getting, hello, Anthony, it's Steve.  Are you going to be able to make it?  Yeah.  There's nothing going on out there.  There's absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  On the ground.  Don't worry about it.  Thanks for nothing.  Well, thanks for nothing.  These panicky Pete's and their stupid freaking forecast.  I think in the year 2008, you shouldn't get that one wrong anymore. 
[00:03:00]  You just shouldn't.  There's too many Dopplers.  Oh, new words, names for these radars.  They got weather machines with all sorts of fancy names.  It shouldn't be a bus like it is.  Basically, here in New York, they said we were going to get at least a foot of snow.  It was going to be a complete nightmare.  The snow was going to start, what, late last night?  Yeah.  And make the commute a complete nightmare.  Till noon today, they said.  Right.  And there's nothing.  And the weather people look like dopes. 
[00:03:30]  They got reporters all over the tri-state area because they were preparing for this big storm.  And now they're going to these reporters and they're just sitting there like,  Well, we dodged a bullet.  Yeah.  That's the best they could say.  They're saying that we dodged a bullet.  Yeah.  They're like, thank goodness.  Yeah.  But then they're still holding on to this hope of scaring people because it's still early enough  and it's dark out and people haven't all gotten their commute started yet.  So they want people to think that it still could be bad. 
[00:04:00]  They won't give it up.  The news can't even get weather right anymore.  I mean, they shouldn't be called the news anymore, obviously.  We're trying to start that movement that they're not allowed to be called the news.  Yeah.  Because there's nothing in it for these local news stations to actually tell you,  You know what?  This storm is going to be a bust.  Yeah.  Because they want you to be watching in the morning.  They need you to watch.  Yeah, they need you to tune in.  They know that a big storm means a lot of ratings for these local news stations.  So, of course, they're not going to ever tell you that it's a bust. 
[00:04:30]  They'd rather come on the next day and go,  Well, we dodged a bullet and all this.  They probably knew sometime yesterday that this storm was going to be a bust.  But they're just not going to do that.  Yeah.  Because if you're the station going, guess what?  It's going to be a non-event.  Then you as a viewer, you're going to go tune in the other station and say,  No, no.  We still think this is going to happen.  It's all about ratings.  Yeah.  So, we get nothing.  So, if you're just waking up, don't pay attention to anybody else.  We'll give you the real story here. 
[00:05:00]  You're going to have an easy commute into your job today.  Don't worry about it.  Look, turn around.  There's another guy live on the street with nothing happening.  They put him on the street for no reason.  I saw one snowflake fly by the guy's face as he's trying to, like,  scare the crap out of all of us with this dumb storm.  Look, Stormwatch.  They even got graphics.  There's no storm.  There's snowflakes in the graphics.  That's annoying.  There's, like, snowflakes.  Yeah.  There's nothing going on.  I mean, I was tricked. 
[00:05:30]  I woke up this morning, jumped up, looked out my window.  I'm like, okay, here we go.  Nothing again.  See, here's a lady.  Look.  Look at behind this lady.  The street doesn't even have a hint of snow.  It's not even wet.  It's barely wet.  She's not a weather person.  There's a stabbing.  I think she was a weather person, but somebody got stabbed where she's at.  Okay, so they moved on to the stabbing story.  She changed her to a stabbing person as opposed to a snow person.  She just had to change her hat.  I'm going from weather girl to stabbing reporter. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I'm stabbing girl now.  I'm stabbing girl now.  The only reason I continue to watch the local news is because it's kind of a – it's just  very interesting to me.  I don't look at it as news anymore.  I just look at it as just – I can't even explain it.  It's just like a – I look at it as something that is so ridiculous in this day and age,  2008.  Yeah.  And they're putting this crap in front of our eyes.  News, BS-ing us.  Complete joke.  All right. 
[00:06:30]  Anyway, so no snow in the New York area.  So there you go.  Steve was panicking.  Yeah, I know.  Panicking.  Well, that's why Patrice is here.  Panicking.  I've never seen anyone panic about anything.  I like to say thank you for having me here by mistake.  Always like to hang out.  Steve, he was in such a panic.  He was like, what if you don't make it in?  I'm like, why don't you just call somebody?  And if I make – who can't?  We're all here.  Yeah.  It's a different mindset, though.  It's a different mindset when Norton is here and you're here than when Norton is not here  and you're here.  Right.  Because there's no – you almost got to – you feel – you're taking your place as opposed 
[00:07:00]  to – like I'm standing here this morning talking and being built up to be you today.  And then you come in and go, ah, shut up.  And I'm like, who's that?  And I'm like, I thought Norton was gone.  Yeah.  That's why I'm here.  So now you can just coast and hang out and have fun.  You can still be you.  Barely.  Shut up.  Barely.  It's a different –  We like you.  There's a 7 o'clock mentality when you're here and it's a 6 a.m.  Basically, Patrice knows his place when you're here.  Yeah, it's a position.  That's what he's saying.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  He knows his place.  Well, I don't want to say it as slave-y as that, but I mean –  Slave-y.  I'm just saying, it's just – you know, it's a different mentality.  It's a 4-45 mentality as opposed to a 6 a.m.  By the way, some guy in Connecticut saying I'm plowing snow right now.  We're not talking about you in particular.  We got Boston calls coming in.  They got lots of snow up there.  All schools closed last night here.  Still no plows out.  So Boston, it's a different story. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We're talking about our perspective here in New York,  how ridiculous these weather people are.  Because they pounded this thing like it was going to be a foot of snow,  standstill, not going to be able to get to work.  We're live in Boston.  There's a difference between Boston and New York when it comes to weather, too.  We don't get as much snow as Boston.  So when they're telling you it's going to snow, it's kind of a big deal down here.  I mean, we lived in Boston.  I mean, there's blizzards and nor'easters,  and everyone's just driving to the mall because they can. 
[00:08:30]  And they're just used to it a little bit more than us down here.  Let's go to John.  What's up, John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, I work for the sanitation department.  They went crazy last night for no reason.  It was on and off.  It was on and off.  They didn't know what was going on.  Well, I mean, you guys don't follow the local weather guy, do you?  Well, we have our own weather department, which is pretty accurate.  Right.  But last night was just crazy.  All right. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Great job.  There's nothing.  Thank you.  Jimmy, what's up?  I just got a note from Steve.  I'll happily take the panicky Pete beating instead of the Steve's a douche beating.  He's got a choice.  Steve, the panicky Pete douche.  Yeah.  Well, no, Jimmy went to see, what, Diana Ross last night?  Yes.  And that's why we thought you weren't going to make it.  It was fabulous.  All the way down there in Atlantic City with a big snowstorm hitting the East Coast.  We're like, I don't think Jimmy's going to make it in today.  She was. 
[00:09:30]  You went.  That's why you was in Atlantic City?  Yes.  I was working in Pennsylvania, and I'm like, I'm an hour and a half from this.  Of course, I like Diana Ross, so I wanted to go see her.  So we went down.  Do you really like Diana Ross, or were you hoping to get a picture?  I didn't try to get a picture.  I didn't call a promoter or anything.  You really didn't try to get a picture?  I would always want a picture, but I made no effort.  Right.  No, no, I loved Diana Ross.  I was convinced when I heard you were going to go see Diana Ross.  I'm like, he just wants a picture.  Matt, I like her, but not enough to, on a school night, go down two and a half hours  away.  Right, right.  They should start making film with Norton already in it. 
[00:10:00]  Just when you take a picture, and Norton's just in a picture already.  He just has a picture of everybody.  I didn't get it, though, with her.  I didn't try to.  No.  Why?  Because I'm not going to get backstage.  That's a tough one.  I mean, I'm not involved in her world.  I don't know anybody she knows.  And you bought a ticket, or you called in a favor?  They gave me one, because I'm there next week, so they were cool.  They gave me a room and a ticket.  Did you really like the concert?  Amazing.  She was, I can't tell, it's like a rock concert.  You?  It's an animal.  She's almost 70 years old. 
[00:10:30]  You're a gay man.  She cannot dance for any, and she's got the only gay people in the world who can't dance  are her fans.  The worst dancing people in the entire planet right there.  It's one big, what is it, a two-hour sing-along?  Because, I mean, is there one song she actually sings where people don't know the words?  Like two new ones, maybe.  But aside from that.  Stupid new songs.  You was by yourself?  No, I went with my girlfriend, and we fought all day, and we didn't speak for seven hours.  So we both were sitting there watching a legend.  It was like Flight of the Concords. 
[00:11:00]  Like, nobody looks at each other.  We were all just kind of staring straight ahead in alternative fashion.  It was really irritating.  So you guys didn't even make up before the concert?  No.  Are you still fighting?  Probably, yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  We just don't get along anymore.  It's not even...  Anymore?  Anymore.  You guys were in love last week.  I'm saying, like, I even said to her, like, as much as I'd like to blame it all on her,  it's like, I know that she's not so completely nuts that she's 100% wrong.  It's just, we just miss each other.  Right.  It's one of those things where we just pass each other. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know how it happens.  So, but the concert was lovely.  And I got a little bit of camera footage of gay people dancing.  Ooh.  They need rock concert security, because they were running right up to the stage and just taking  pictures of her, and the guys were like, I kind of go back.  Right.  You know, at rock concerts, they'd grab you and throw you out.  Oh, yeah.  Right on your ass.  Huh.  A bunch of gay people and us.  It was nice.  And a long ride back to New York without talking?  Well, yeah.  Well, not talking pleasantly.  Oh, really?  That was awful. 
[00:12:00]  Just nipping at each other?  Nip, nip, nip, nip.  Or full-fledged argument?  Hey, Norton, how come you don't exercise your better than her muscles more often?  I just...  Well, you know, you can't do it in a relationship.  I mean, your friends can tell you to do that, but in a relationship, you're like, you know  how it is, man.  You're like...  It was just...  I don't know.  I wanted to punch the windshield out.  I told her that.  I'm like, I want to punch...  You just like drama.  I can't do it anymore.  I can't do it anymore.  You just like drama.  Just stop.  I don't like drama.  I'm too old.  I'm 40.  You do like drama.  You're arguing with...  You're better than that.  You're selling out the ball garden next week, and you're having a punch-the-window argument? 
[00:12:30]  Like, what is the matter with you?  Well, I wasn't arguing with my agent.  But as I was saying, you're like, gosh darn it.  Why don't you...  Jimmy...  Explaining life to your girl is just...  Jimmy likes being in love.  He does.  He wants a girlfriend, and he takes it very seriously, so...  We all do, but...  No, you don't.  You're in your own world.  I absolutely...  You're from another planet.  He does in his own way.  But yeah, I do.  I do take it seriously.  I just...  I hate to see suffering.  Yeah.  Especially when Norton is like selling out the place with Diana Ross. 
[00:13:00]  Are you performing in the same place she was?  No, I did that room with Attell.  We did one show there.  No, no, no.  I'm doing the music box.  She did the events.  But you're still doing...  It's the difference between the Madison Square Garden with 25,000 and the other one.  It's that...  Yeah.  It's still major.  Yeah, it's a great gig.  I mean, it's still Atlantic City, the Vegas of the East Coast.  Jimmy's downplaying it.  It's a big room, man.  Yeah, dude.  And he sold out three shows down there.  Yeah, but Miss Ross had one big sellout.  Miss Ross, you're calling it.  She's wonderful, man.  How does that one woman sneak into...  I'm always curious about that. 
[00:13:30]  How does the one woman...  Sneak into the...  Like, you guys are famous and Norton's famous.  How does that one girl be the one when it's so many?  How does that one end up the one that's your woman that you're going to deal with all the nonsense?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I know my girl.  I'm like that.  Because she hung around so long.  You know, she's just there.  She's just there.  Is that how she did it?  She was just...  She wouldn't go.  You know what I mean?  But how does...  The key is to find one where there's no nonsense, Patrice. 
[00:14:00]  Or less nonsense.  I have nonsense.  It's like I can't help it.  You have nonsense.  But I don't have...  But how does she squeeze in to...  How does she squeeze in?  She's the funniest person I probably...  She honestly...  God, she makes me laugh.  She's guy funny.  I can't...  I honestly can tell you, she makes me...  Impossible.  No, she's really funny.  She really makes me laugh.  You gotta give her credit.  She's really funny.  She really?  Dude, she makes me laugh.  Just hanging out.  She's a funny girl, man.  Really hard.  Like, not polite.  My girlfriend laughs.  But like, for real, laughs.  Really?  Yeah.  And that was when we became friends for three years. 
[00:14:30]  We were friends for a long time, so...  Yeah.  Oh, you were friends for a minute.  She was one of my best friends, yeah, for a long time.  For a minute.  Oh, okay, okay.  Hey, Jimmy, I also heard that you might have had a dream last night.  Or was it two nights ago?  Oh, yeah, no, no, two nights...  Oh, yeah, I told Steve, remind me.  I had a dream that I had a threesome.  This is the absolute truth.  With her and Tom Chiasano.  What does that mean?  First of all, that's not a threesome.  You and Tom Chiasano pull the train on your girl.  Holy moly.  Quickly, for the newbies, Tom Chiasano, he's 60. 
[00:15:00]  He's the GM of the station here in New York City.  Worked a very long time with Howard Stern, and you had a threesome in your dream.  I bet he had his suit jacket, all his suit tops.  His tie and everything was on.  Just his pants was off, but he had his tie and everything else was...  I just picture this scene from Office Space with Lumberg, like, having sex with the guy's  girlfriend that he met over at the restaurant.  Yeah, holding her ankles and drinking coffee.  Yeah.  Hey, are those TPS reports in? 
[00:15:30]  And they're showing him just kind of banging her.  I wish I had a better...  It was a very brief dream.  It was...  Let's just say...  You don't need a better story.  That alone is...  You was playing Ring Around the Rose.  You were, uh...  No, we didn't...  All we did was this.  She was in the dream.  I'll be...  Let's see.  She was laying on her back.  Tom was doing something.  Let's just say he was making her feel very good.  And I was kissing her.  And that was the whole dream.  And you was being loving while old Tom was smashing her yams?  Yeah.  And he kept talking to her, like, in boring, like, regular guy talk.  Like, all right, I'm going to do this right now. 
[00:16:00]  And he was just, like, talking like we're talking right now.  And there was nothing sexy about it.  Did he make a dude commercial reads?  Did he wipe his mouth with his tie?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Why would you dream that?  What kind of fraudulent something is that?  I don't know.  Did he try to figure out how he could bring a sponsor into the whole situation?  You know, we could sponsor this.  Did he push the dump button?  Oh.  It looked like a lemon party with one chick. 
[00:16:30]  Didn't that wake you up, though?  There are dreams that happen where I wake up instantly.  Wake up like it's in the movies.  Yeah, I don't want to.  Somehow my brain knows I don't want to deal with this.  And I wake up instantly.  I don't remember what woke me up.  But that was as far as the sex went.  He was doing that.  And I was making out with her.  And then I wish I could remember more of what he was saying in the dream.  Because it was completely mechanical sexual stuff.  Yeah, it wasn't sexy at all.  That's so odd.  Yeah.  Get on with this. 
[00:17:00]  I got to golf at 12.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Stuff like that.  Get on with it.  It was quick.  Making golf innuendo jokes about your girl.  There's quite a few you can use, you know.  Grab his putter.  Oh, God.  Something about the 18th hole.  No one looks disturbed by that, too.  It looks like he's thinking about why he actually had that dream about that.  Well, he's going to yell at her now.  Huh?  I want to call her cuckold. 
[00:17:30]  You're a dream cuckold.  Do bring up that word a lot, Jimmy.  I never knew the word until I started hanging out with you.  I've been kind of liking those movies.  The dream cuckold.  You know what a cuckold is, right?  Where you kind of sit there and watch your girl get railed, basically, by somebody else.  Yeah, I know what a cuckold is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy has brought that down.  I know what it was.  Without you getting any action, right?  Wait, so you watch these type of films?  Lately, I have been, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  What, cuckold films?  Are they believable?  Because I would imagine a lot of those are just...  Some are.  A lot of times...  How do you know they're believable?  Well, just because I think that the way the girl's reacting to the guy...  Like, if it's a hardcore film by actors, it doesn't do anything for me.  Right.  But when it's an average-looking girl and just the guy who's packing, to me, I like that  because that's like a girl who's humiliating her husband.  It's like a lot of times a guy just sits there and all she's doing is talking to the guy.  She's like, what a real man.  It's like, I like the girl acting like such a slut. 
[00:18:30]  Here comes Hot Pals right here.  There he is.  Is it kind of creepy to see you?  Is it weird to look at him now after that dream?  Look where the bike started at.  Tom Chiasano.  Yeah.  Was there anything that stimulated this or was it...  I don't know what happened.  It was weird, but it was a very brief thing and it was only that.  I just woke up right after that and I told her about it.  We kind of had a laugh about it.  I bet it's nine.  Does Tom look good naked?  No, he wasn't naked.  Honest to God, he was dressed.  He was dressed like that.  Of course he was.  Yeah, with his pants.  He was just his pants back off. 
[00:19:00]  And Mike Ruff.  He was wearing his pants off, just a zipper down.  Just a zipper down.  Yeah.  And that old man eight coming out.  Oh, Jesus.  Just that Viagra eight.  I think what Jimmy was describing, though.  By the way, it's an old man nine.  I bet it is.  I think what Jimmy was describing, though, was the fact that that wasn't even being used.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Yeah.  Tom was doing stuff where perhaps his braces would have had to have been cleaned out afterwards. 
[00:19:30]  That's all.  Yeah.  It was very, very...  Yeah.  Taking care of business.  Calling you young fella.  Young fella.  And you're sitting there watching.  I was just kissing her.  I don't know what it means.  Honest to God, that's the whole dream.  Wow.  Nothing else happened.  You and I certainly didn't interact.  There was none of that, like, you really want your job stuff happening.  No, it basically means you would sacrifice your girl for a raise.  That's...  It's odd.  I bet you that is, like, psychology-wise, I bet you.  Definitely.  That's very obvious.  Something like that going on.  Yeah.  She didn't know who Tom... 
[00:20:00]  She didn't know...  She's like, Tom, do I meet him?  And she's like, was he the guy that we went out with?  I'm like, no, that was Eric Logan.  I'm sure they'll be, like, you know...  Yeah.  Murder happens.  I'm sure they'll be banging him in a dream.  You just want Tom...  You want Tom to notice you.  I'm a...  I analyze dreams.  I'm a dream reader now.  I'm not, but...  Oh, you are.  But you just want Tom to notice you, no matter what.  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yeah, a little more recognition.  Jimmy, one vision, I notice Jimmy all the time.  Thank you.  They call me the live-read kid.  Yes.  All right.  All right, Tom. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you.  Well, thank you for including me in your after-work life.  Thank you for...  Thanks for doing a good job on her.  How about those Rangers, Tom, huh?  Islanders are on a little roll, my man.  I should have taken that bet.  I should have taken that bet.  Tom's music is hilarious.  The dead people...  Oh, it's just all now taps and funeral music.  Let me bring everyone on board.  Tom thinks we need more sounds on this show, so there you go.  He gets his special sounds every time he comes in now. 
[00:21:00]  All right, we got to take a break.  These boards are not enough?  No.  No, no.  We got to take a break.  Listen, we're going to talk some football after the break.  Patrice's Pats won, of course.  Jimmy's Cowboys lost.  Eli's not playing football.  He's done for the year, so we'll do a little bit on that.  What else?  Oh, Anthony's gambling, of course.  Eli?  Yes.  What are you talking about?  Eli's out.  No, it's coming out.  I mean, Peyton's out.  I'm sorry.  It's early.  Yeah, Peyton's out.  Who would have thought that, you know, Eli would still be playing and Peyton wouldn't 
[00:21:30]  be sitting at this point?  All right, we'll talk about Anthony's gambling.  He did a big weekend at Mohegan Sun.  There's a bunch of other things.  We got to look at the show.  Oh, OJ.  Yeah, all right.  We're just getting started.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  We're supposed to have a huge storm here in New York City.  It's a bust.  It's a bust.  Everyone calm down.  Yeah, nothing.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  You got the onaradio.com. 
[00:22:00]  And for the people that linger longer on onaradio.com later this afternoon, or later this morning  probably, an old commercial featuring our old pal Joey Paisano.  It is so bad.  We're calling it old school Opie and Anthony, basically.  It is really bad.  See, for the people.  TV commercial.  I guess for the rest of the country, at our old gig, when we were doing Afternoon Drive,  one of our biggest advertisers was Paisano's and Mulberry Street. 
[00:22:30]  And Tom, relax.  He sold the restaurant, so we're not trying to promote his restaurant.  I don't even know who owns it anymore.  He moved out of Little Italy over a year ago.  But, before we started doing all that great advertising for Joey, he was pretty much in  bed with Scott and Todd here in New York City.  Yeah.  And they actually filmed a TV commercial.  Mm-hmm.  And I guess Joey must have put it up on YouTube.  He must have.  Yeah.  It's up there, and we're going to link it to onaradio.com later today. 
[00:23:00]  It's so bad.  We didn't know what to say when we saw it.  We were very uncomfortable.  Yeah, I had no words.  I don't want to be friends with Joey anymore after seeing this commercial.  Joey does not look like Joey.  No, no.  No, not at all.  And they're all doing these bad, like, Italian stereotypes.  Yeah.  It's really horrid.  By the way.  They're just horrible.  If you don't want to wait for us to link it up later on onaradio.com, it's Scott.  You throw Scott and Todd starring Joey's Paisano into YouTube, and you'll find it. 
[00:23:30]  Look at Joey.  Look at Joey.  It's a bigger Joey.  A much bigger Joey.  With the glasses?  Yeah.  That was Joey.  It's like Jerry Lewis after the steroids.  Yeah.  Yeah, where he blew up.  All right.  Hey, speaking of the big snowstorm here in New York that didn't happen, Sam did a great  job.  He put this together.  Basically, this is what they were saying last night on the local news.  Well, as we said, snow and rain are falling across the tri-state, and some schools have 
[00:24:00]  already posted delays and closings for tomorrow.  You'll see those along the bottom of your screen there.  Well, right now, Erica Tarantel is in North Bergen with more on how people spent the day  preparing for this storm.  Expect the morning ride to look very different from this late-night drive.  What's wet is forecast to be white.  There's no question about it.  Tomorrow morning is not going to be an easy commute.  It's going to be snow, slush, speed limits probably reduced on the turnpike to about 45 miles  an hour.  Yeah.  Is it? 
[00:24:30]  And really, I was doing 80 on the expressway.  And this is what they're saying this morning.  I tell you what, we were fired up.  I'm not going to kid you.  We thought we were going to get it this time.  And the storm, it disappointed all of us, especially the children.  Now, some of them, of course, have gone in a little bit late today.  But temperatures, that was an issue.  Let's walk and talk, and we'll break it down for you and tell you what our issues were.  Among them, the storm never really picked up in intensity.  And when it arrived here, well, it was just soggy out there.  The temperature's just too warm. 
[00:25:00]  Now, you know.  And I'll say it again.  You know, this is on purpose.  They probably knew late last night or sometime after the football games that this storm wasn't  going to have the punch.  They know.  But they don't want you to stop watching their news chat.  No.  That's the problem with the news.  That's why you can't really call it the news anymore.  Just call it, like, entertainment BS.  Call it newsertainment.  Yeah.  You want another example?  We got plenty of them.  Here's what they were saying last night on another station.  Road crews in New Jersey and New York City prepped early in the day for the storm moving 
[00:25:30]  in.  We're ready to go out with 1,400 plows tonight throughout the city along with our over 350  soil spreaders.  Shoppers in South Hackensack were also ready to go.  Some grabbed a movie.  Others, extra groceries in case the snow means an extra day off.  In case we get stuck inside the house and not able to work.  So we're stacking up, ready to cook.  And your best bet getting to work on time tomorrow is leaving plenty of extra time.  Also, crews want to remind all drivers to leave extra room for the salt spreaders and 
[00:26:00]  the plow trucks so they can do their work safely.  Yeah, well, of course.  They've got to get through that snow.  Have you ever gone to the grocery store or a bodega or a corn, whatever, and got extra  groceries because you thought you were going to be stuck inside?  It would be snowed in.  I actually throw food out when they say a storm's coming.  Nothing in my house.  Oh, my God.  And we're supposed to vote for the next president with these people out there that have to go  get groceries because we might get some snow? 
[00:26:30]  Morons.  And then there's what they were saying this morning.  It's great to be here.  Thanks so much.  I was worried about getting here this morning, but all is well outside.  Yes.  In most part.  For the most part.  You know, it's a little storm that couldn't for the most part as well for most of the  Tri-State area.  North and east of town, there's still a little bit of snow on the ground and some still  falling.  But for the most part, this was not the heavy hitter in the city.  And on south, nothing really.  Roads are just wet.  Yeah.  Of course.  Dopes.  Just a bunch of hype.  And they brag about their weather machines. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  The Doppler 9000 future cast 400 million.  Yeah.  What happened to the Doppler that you brag about all the time?  Doppler's like old news now.  They don't even say that anymore.  Because it's just a boring name.  Yeah.  So they've come up with even better names like forecast 6,000.  And it's just weird numbers after the machine.  Yeah.  Whatever the machine is.  And then big numbers.  Make sure that your number is bigger than the other news channels number. 
[00:27:30]  Because then you're that much better.  Well, it's one more better.  Could they call like the infinity forecaster infinity?  Infinity.  Infinity to infinity.  Infinity times infinity.  Yeah.  The Doppler pi squared.  Yeah.  What a douche.  Imagine how that would change if they fired a whole bunch of weathermen after a night  like last night.  They should.  They just fired 40 of them.  No, actually, they're probably going to get raises from the news station.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Because they got people to continue watching their program.  That's all it takes.  That's all it is.  Actually, you would get fired for being the guy going, oh, look, man, I know everyone  else is saying it, but I can't lie anymore.  I've looked at the Doppler or the infinity machine, and this is going to be a bust.  What are you doing?  They would fire him right on the spot.  People aren't going to tune in.  So, all right, enough of that.  Anthony had the big gambling weekend.  Yes, this was the big weekend that Mohegan Sun was flying us up there. 
[00:28:30]  Well, you took a lot of money from Mohegan, safe to say.  Well, yeah.  And they kind of wanted their money back, so they offered you, you know, a trip up to  Mohegan on them, basically, a free ride in a plane, limos, and all sorts of, and suites,  and all that.  Oh, yeah.  Basically, they think you're a whale.  It was like a rock star.  Yeah.  It's great.  Took Keith and his wife and mom and Sal, which is just a rip because my mom doesn't like flying 
[00:29:00]  much at all, and with the smaller plane and the weather the way it was on Friday, probably  the worst flying conditions ever.  It was JFK Jr. flying conditions where you can't see anything out there.  So, my mother was, it was like Weekend at Bernie's.  She had taken a Valium.  The plane was delayed for a little bit, so we went over to that 56 fighter group over there 
[00:29:30]  at Republic.  Yeah.  Downed a few.  Of course you did.  Downed a few.  Why wouldn't you?  So, it was pretty much, you know, getting mom on the plane.  She was a little.  Why don't you just tell us you were breathing?  A little tipsy.  Well.  I love how Anthony brings that to our attention.  Like, really?  You had a few.  Well, you know, the plane was delayed because of the weather.  Well, what else would you do if the plane was delayed?  Well, you're not going to just sit around Republic Airport. 
[00:30:00]  I gotcha.  There's really nothing going on there.  So, you had a few.  Mom had a Valium.  A little Valium.  Yeah.  And a couple of drinks.  So, yeah, she was a little, you know, a little loose.  A little like, hey, let's get on the plane kind of a thing.  And so, we all got on the plane.  And the weather was horrific.  I mean, it was rain.  They had some thunder and lightning.  Can I slow you down for a second? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Because I already know the answer, but I think a bunch of people will laugh at their radios.  When we left everybody on Friday, you were getting the, you know, the private jet to Mohegan Sun.  Right.  I know you didn't get the private jet.  Well, it had two jets in it.  It was a turboprop.  With a lot of other whales, too, right?  No, there were a few.  A few?  It wasn't like, you know, I had to sit next to people I didn't want to talk to or anything. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  And, yeah, they were all going to the same place.  They just picked up all the whales like a bus all over Long Island and brought them to Mohegan Sun.  No, it's a little better than that.  It wasn't like hopping on the Jitney.  All right.  You know, and it's about a 30-minute flight.  Yeah.  The longest.  It's probably 20 minutes.  But with the weather the way it was, oh, my God.  Oh, was that just a horrific flight. 
[00:31:30]  Nothing but turbulence.  And then when we go to land, you saw no ground.  It was nothing but fog right up until.  And I was kind of videotaping out the window just in case, you know, anything happens.  I want to have a little record of it.  Yeah.  They won't find you, but they'll find your little.  Find a little memory chip.  Maybe.  They'll find it, plug it in and go, wow, look at that.  He taped his own crash.  Death.  Well, here's the jangle of little, like, airplane liquor bottles. 
[00:32:00]  There wasn't even time for that.  It was time for one beer.  This must have been where Anthony was sitting.  How do you know that, sir?  Well, look at all the empties around.  A lot of empties.  The jingle jangle of the vodka bottles.  But the plane kind of is coming in for a landing.  You feel it.  And then you hear him hit the throttle, and we're going back up again.  And he comes on and goes, ah, I saw the runway a little too late on that one. 
[00:32:30]  Jesus.  So we're going around.  We're going around again.  You don't want to hear that.  So it was a very hard, yeah.  Had a guy with a torch.  Yeah.  It was a very long circle that he took.  I think he was waiting for the clouds to break up a little and gave it another try.  So we start descending again and didn't even get close this time.  Back up again.  Now he doesn't even go to the radio.  Is there anything more horrifying than being in a plane and having no clue as you look 
[00:33:00]  out the window?  You see nothing?  It was.  We didn't know where we were.  Does anyone else just picture mountains?  It was white.  In front of you?  Yes.  The giant Rockies of Connecticut.  Well, whatever.  I don't even care.  It could be an antenna or something.  If we're over the ocean and you see nothing when you look out the window, I'm convinced there's  going to be some huge sea monster that's popping his head up and we're going to crash in too.  I was saying that if you're at 35,000 feet and something goes bad and you're just spiraling 
[00:33:30]  in and you have time to text friends and actually get a response back and take care of some  last minute business, fill out a will as you're plummeting, that's one thing.  If you're in fog during a landing and you hit something, pretty much from the school of  thought, it's over pretty quickly.  Pretty fast.  You're just like, you're flying, you're looking out the window, g-g, bam, it's over.  Bam, the old beyond, whatever happens after this, that's it.  That's what's happening.  That's it.  Goes to Buddy Holly and the Big Bobber. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's the Big Bobber.  Hello, Anthony.  Hello, Anthony.  Flew too low, baby.  That plane came in too slow, baby.  Glass in your face.  Hello.  Hello, baby.  The clouds are too low, baby.  You know what I like.  A runway. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, man.  That's pretty much what it was.  Oh, man.  So the second approach, he bails.  He missed that one.  A little go around.  And now it's a real long approach.  I think he's lining up pretty far out because we went back out over the Long Island Sound  and came back again.  And this 25-minute flight is now an hour.  We're an hour in the air.  And I have a video clip of this.  I'm out the window.  I'm looking out the window.  And it's nothing but pea soup clouds. 
[00:35:00]  You see the prop going.  And from the time we broke through the clouds to the time we actually landed was 30 seconds.  It was 30 seconds from the time he saw nothing till he saw the runway.  Make sure you're lined up.  Gear down.  Flaps down.  Hit the runway hard and fast.  And then just...  And everyone on the plane.  Of course.  Did the applause.  Of course you got to applaud.  They applauded the pilot. 
[00:35:30]  And you're still alive.  Yeah.  What a dumb thing to do.  Oh, I'm alive.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  We live.  We live another day.  And then the whole thing with Republic is a little odd, too.  I just want to say to any terrorist listening, Republic Airport would be the place you want to go.  Because no checks whatsoever.  No security. 
[00:36:00]  Can they please do something with Republic?  I understand they're commuter planes, but some of these planes carry, like, 30 people.  Ah.  What are they going to do?  Take out a brownstone?  No.  That could do some damage.  It could absolutely do some damage.  Yeah.  And then we're flying back.  And the cockpit door is open.  The whole flight.  Yeah.  It's just open.  It was lonely.  There's people with carry-on that has not been checked. 
[00:36:30]  At all.  No one looked at it.  It went through no machine.  Nothing.  You just get on this plane.  It's a little odd to me.  They just know it wouldn't do much damage.  That's what it comes down to.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  That's exactly what it is.  I think that thing full of fuel could probably do a lot of damage.  The government doesn't think so.  They don't really care about your life.  And maybe 30 hostages?  They'll let 30 hostages be beheaded, the government.  Yeah?  Yes.  That's how it works. 
[00:37:00]  It's a little creepy.  Government would pretty much be, yeah, it sucks.  It's nice to be you guys.  I don't know what to tell you.  I'm serious.  Got to make a big splash.  Yeah.  If you're a terrorist.  Little stuff like that, government's like, yeah, whatever.  Yeah, maybe that's why they didn't, but I don't know.  So how was the gambling?  Well, let me tell you.  Day one, sat down, broke out about 10 Gs to start with, and built it up to $70,000. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  First day you're up 60 Gs?  Yeah.  Wow.  Which I promptly lost.  Same day?  Well, same session.  Same session.  Yeah.  They really turned it around on me.  Why were you?  Turned it around.  Because I was gunning for $100,000, okay?  I wasn't going to stop at $70,000. 
[00:38:00]  I know my question is really stupid.  That's why I don't think I have the gambling bug in me, because there's a point where I just,  you know what, I walk.  What point?  $20,000?  $30,000?  You just feel it.  $40,000?  You just feel like, wow, this is kind of nice.  I wasn't feeling it.  It felt good.  I was going for $100,000.  And that's what the casino bank's on.  Going for $100,000.  If you were at $70,000, when you went backwards, why wouldn't you go, all right, I just gave  them $20,000 or $25,000 back and then go from there?  No, because then you win it back plus more.  Okay. 
[00:38:30]  See, this is what they depend on.  It's what the casino depends on.  Have you made up your mind that once you lost all the money, all the gambling money that  you've been gambling with, you go, I'm done.  No.  Of course not.  I wasn't done.  I got it back.  When you lose it all, are you ready to quit?  No.  Are you going to go into your own savings after you lose gambling money?  No, no, no, no, no savings, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But I'm saying your own, your money, your money.  Oh, if it's all gone like that? 
[00:39:00]  Like this gambling money.  At some point, then I'd have to.  I'm not going to stop, you know, going to casinos, but, you know, why?  I thought your whole thing was like, I'm going to bet with this money.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was what I'm going to do.  Like, you had a pride to bet with that money.  But if that money goes, then you're not going to stop.  You're still going to bet.  Yeah, you're going to get the money from somewhere.  Oh, I took more than 10 with me.  No, I understand that.  What Patrice is saying, you kind of made it obvious to everybody that you're playing off 
[00:39:30]  money you might have won.  Right.  So when you lose all that money, because you will, you're going to continue gambling.  Yeah, then what?  I'm never supposed to go to a casino again?  But you're saying you're not going to take it out of your savings.  Oh, I have to.  Where else am I going to get it?  All right, there you go.  Yeah, no, but as long as you're so you're you're what does it end?  I don't know when I'm broke and destitute.  No, no, of course not.  So listen, you it's it's it's believe me, I don't need an intervention here.  I don't care about your stupid money. 
[00:40:00]  I'm just curious.  Look at Patrice.  Like, he gives a crap.  I know.  I didn't think he did.  It's just trying to figure out what happens.  Yeah, he's just trying to learn.  I don't know.  Let's see what happens.  See what the future brings.  Like, I definitely wasn't going to put my hand on your shoulder and go, listen, Anthony,  I think I love you, man.  I think you have a problem.  Wow, you read that wrong.  I think you have a problem.  Patrice is just wants to write about this.  I just want to know, how does it stop?  Like, what do you go?  Oh, OK, I'm done.  You keep playing. 
[00:40:30]  You know, just keep playing.  You got to be you got to be somewhat responsible.  You can't, you know, you can't just spend all your money gambling.  That's not good.  Right.  I don't.  Is there a place before destitute and desperate or whatever?  Is there a place where you go, OK, I'm fished?  Yeah.  I feel I spent too much money.  I won't go back to a casino for a while.  This is the first time I'm back in a few months.  He's got the bug.  We'll see what happens. 
[00:41:00]  He'll be interested.  Listen, I'm not taking the, you know, jitney down there every weekend.  I'm just, you know, I'm having fun.  Flying in fog bank.  Oh, I know.  That was a little odd, but who knew it was going to be death defying?  Early morning Jaws weather.  Like, you know, the weather when they go fishing in the morning with fog coming up off the water.  Don't know where Jaws is.  Yeah, like that.  It's just going to pop out of nowhere.  Like he's flying where you hear those things going, bing, bing, bing, bing. 
[00:41:30]  And you're flying to a casino.  Yeah.  Damn Buddy Holly death trap.  We got to take a break.  So the first day you took 10.  You turned it into what?  I turned it into 70.  And then lost it all.  Took another five.  And turned that into 20.  And that's the first day.  So I was ahead.  You went 70, down to five, back up to 20. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Okay, when we get back, we'll get the end of the story.  How's that sound?  Yes.  All right.  Because there was a lot of up and down stuff going on.  Also, as we go to break, got a lot of requests for this.  So we're going to play it one more time.  It's Roger Clemens admitting that he did the roids.  Yeah.  This is obviously fake for the idiots out there.  But people want to hear this one more time.  So if you listen closely, it sounds like Clemens did do the roids as we go to break on the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report. 
[00:42:30]  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject.  And now the whole world knows the answer is that I use steroids.  Over the last 15 days or so, when I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays,  Brian Mack made use steroids to inject into my body.  And I'm very thankful for those steroids.  And it's been extremely difficult to do this.  I'm almost numb to steroids and human growth hormones.  I'm angry about it, to be honest with you.  It's hurtful to have thousands of people to inject human growth hormone into my body. 
[00:43:00]  My friends inject steroids into my body.  The New York Yankees inject human growth hormone into my body.  My children use drugs, and it means a lot to me.  In my family, to inject steroids.  Again, it's amazing to me that I have to even use steroids.  And I want to say thanks to Brian McNamee of the New York Yankees.  After Christmas, I'm going to sit down with Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, 
[00:43:30]  and I'll inject drugs into my body.  Right there in front of him, and we'll do all this again.  And let me be clear, I'm very thankful for those steroids.  And Mike Wallace used drugs now that that's come out.  My children inject steroids into Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes.  But we're coming upon Christmas now, and I have been blessed in my life.  I've been blessed in my career.  And the answer is that I use steroids.  That's right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice O'Neill in studio. 
[00:44:00]  PatriceO'Neill.com for his tour dates, right?  Yes, sir, thank you.  All right.  We were talking about Anthony's big gambling weekend up there in Moheganstone.  Yeah.  We left you, what, you took 10, 10 Gs, you turned it into 70, lost it all.  I was corrected.  I took 5, turned it into 70.  Okay.  And then lost it all, took another 5, and turned it into 20. 
[00:44:30]  Your money's there in Moheganstone?  Well, see, that's what I do.  I take it up there, and then I deposit it in what's called a front money account.  What's that?  That's where you just walk up to the table.  Instead of having to have a lot of cash and throwing it at the table,  you just go, I'll have a marker, please.  And then they fill out some paperwork, you sign it, and they give you the chips  based on an account that you have.  Do they get to keep your money and invest it?  No, it's there for, you know, the weekend.  What are they going to do? 
[00:45:00]  And then you take a check back, though, right?  Yeah, you check, cash, whatever you want.  So you walk around like Scarface?  It's like the money counter.  With the clock with the missing 12.  Take it to the limit.  Limit!  Limit!  Why is there a hole in the 12 on the clock?  What's the matter?  I'm too stupid.  It's the point of no return.  I can't see that there's a camera in the 12.  It's the matter what you're mentioning. 
[00:45:30]  Manolo.  I know we're all over the place today, but our weather people, whatever you want to call them,  they have gone north.  They're now broadcasting from Hartford and Boston for New York.  They kept going north until they actually found snow.  No, we're here in the Arctic Circle.  Yeah, because the snowstorm was a bust here in New York.  They said, you know what?  Just drive north until you find something.  We're looking pretty stupid.  All right, so the second day of gambling. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, that was really, really bad.  This is Friday.  Yeah, that was Friday.  And then this is Saturday.  So you wake up Saturday late afternoon.  Yep.  And how much are you up or down?  Well, I was up like $10,000.  Okay.  But then I hit a brick wall.  I have never seen dealers pulling shenanigans like they were against me.  It was stunning. 
[00:46:30]  If I had a 17 and the dealer is showing a 4, that 4 will turn into an 18.  They would get me by 1 every time.  I'm pushing on blackjack.  I'm pushing on blackjacks.  And everything else, 20s, you know, the dealer is showing a picture card.  I'm dealt first card a picture card.  The second card is a 3 or a 4.  And then the dealer's got a picture card showing. 
[00:47:00]  And every time they flip that over, boosh, there's their other picture card.  Did it come to you that you're thinking maybe they're using a special deck because they want their money back really badly?  No, I truly don't think they can do that.  And he warned you about that.  Yeah.  And he gave you all sorts of advice.  I think there are definite dealers that just have an aura about them that are coolers.  They're coolers.  There's something about them.  They can go in there and consistently just screw you.  You believe in coolers?  Yeah, I do. 
[00:47:30]  And you think the casino believes in it, too?  Like, they put, like, if it's a hot table, they'll just put one of these coolers on the table just to make everybody lose?  I think they do.  I usually play alone at a reserve table.  Sometimes I'll play with other people.  But there was this one guy.  I'm sitting there with another guy.  We're having a great time.  We're doing all right.  He knows how to play.  I know how to play.  We're just kind of, you know, because I go into the, what they call the high roller room.  I'm, like, hanging out with the riffraff. 
[00:48:00]  And then this guy comes down with his cowboy hat.  I believe he was Middle Eastern.  Sits down.  And he's contemplating, with the dealers showing a picture card, he's contemplating not hitting a 13.  So me and the other guy that had been sitting at the table for a while look at each other like, uh-oh.  And it worked out that time.  But every other bet now, I'm just betting the minimum.  And I'm, like, I can't do anything because I'm afraid to make a big bet that this guy is going to screw me. 
[00:48:30]  He should have or he shouldn't have made that, uh-  I hate that philosophy.  No, don't hate it.  This ain't even right.  What is he supposed to do?  Hit the goddamn thing.  No, so you hit a 13.  You hit a 13 if the dealer's showing a 10.  Why can't it work out in your favor if this guy's playing dumb?  It might.  But you know something?  It might not.  All the gamblers are convinced if there's a guy at your table playing bad, that's going to affect you.  You're playing the odds.  Then don't fuck.  And why should I care?  Excuse me.  And why should I care? 
[00:49:00]  Because this conversation comes up.  Because if I got $6,000 up, and this idiot's got $100 up.  Why should I care about your six G's?  What if I go, I'm thinking only about my 13?  You know something?  You're right.  You shouldn't.  That's why I play at reserve tables.  So I don't got to play with idiots like that.  But the game goes by way too fast when you're you and a dealer.  Me?  I'll sit there after dealing a couple of hands.  If I take a couple of beatings, I'll sit back in my chair. 
[00:49:30]  I'll sit my drink.  I'll talk to a couple of people.  I'll talk to Keith.  I'll talk to the dealer.  I'll talk to the pit boss.  Oh, wait.  My pace.  How much money do you have to spend to get a table that no one else can play at?  Oh, they want you, you know, making some big bets consistently.  A little more than that, Jim.  Really?  And it's your table.  My table.  No one can sit there.  My table.  I don't understand that logic that, you know, a bad player.  Dude, dude, then you're a guy that, I'm talking, then you're a guy that if any blackjack  player that plays consistently, they don't want you at their table. 
[00:50:00]  All right, so I say you have no choice.  You got a bad player.  He's hitting when he's not supposed to hit.  Leave the table.  Because he's hitting when he's not supposed to, you're winning like crazy.  Then what?  It could happen.  All right.  But you leave the table because the guy will screw you.  He will screw you.  But he could also help you.  Most times he's going to screw you.  You got to play the odds.  I just don't get it.  Well, you got to get it.  You would be yelled at and pummeled by some guys. 
[00:50:30]  Trust me, I know this is, you guys all think the same.  You get all pissed off when a guy's playing badly at a blackjack table.  Because he doesn't know what he's doing.  So what's the idea of this guy with 13?  The idea is the dealer is showing a 10.  Right.  And one card is buried.  You don't know what it is.  Okay.  And you're showing a 13.  You see both cards.  You know you only have a 13.  The dealer, the odds are that dealer has got better than you.  So hit the goddamn thing.  If he doesn't hit, let's say he doesn't hit.  And then the dealer turns his card over and he takes the next card that this other idiot 
[00:51:00]  should have taken and he winds up pulling a 21 instead of busting.  The table will kill that stupid idiot.  But like Ope said, sometimes it might work out.  His thought might be he's going to bust.  He's going to get a 9.  Well, you know something?  Take the goddamn card and take the chance.  Because that's how it works.  But it's for your benefit.  Then get your own reserve table and play like an idiot.  Patrice, I've seen it.  These guys will kill you. 
[00:51:30]  And I never understood that.  Get your own table.  Play like an idiot.  But you want him to play.  There's no team playing.  There is kind of a team thing at a blackjack table.  There is a team.  Oh, to get the dealer to bust.  It's right, right.  Your job is to get the dealer to bust and let the table win.  And if this jackass screws things up, you want to kill him.  And this is what he was doing.  Because the odds are he's going to screw up.  And he was screwing up.  So I got up and left the table.  So I sit down at a brand new table. 
[00:52:00]  And I have to wait now for the reshuffle.  I have to wait for a marker.  Wait.  All this time goes by that I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.  And what does this guy do?  He gets up.  The second I'm ready to play it, plays my first bet.  Cowboy hat guy sits down right next to me.  Right next to me.  So I look at the dealer.  I grab all my chips.  And I go, I can't sit here and play at this table.  He goes, why?  I go, I'd rather not say.  And I looked at cowboy hat guy. 
[00:52:30]  And the dealer knew exactly what I was talking about.  What's wrong with cowboy hat guy?  He was the guy that was the idiot.  He followed me.  Oh, he followed you.  He followed me.  Because he's working for the casino.  Maybe you were the idiot.  No, he was the idiot.  He's working for the casino.  They're trying to mess you up.  So that's when I went, you know something?  I'm going back to my reserve table.  So I went back to the reserve table.  And proceeded to lose a lot of money.  Just lost a lot of money.  And they have, like, a rope around it, like, so people know they can't come down. 
[00:53:00]  It's a little plaque that says reserved.  And if anybody tries to sit there, they go, hey, hey, hey, hey, reserved.  You lost a lot of money now.  Are you dipping into your, like, regular money at this point?  Yeah, yeah.  At some point, I had to dip.  I had to dip.  So the money you brought with you was gone.  Now you're dipping.  Was gone, and I was dipping.  So the reason you want the other guy to play well, I get it now, is because he could bust the dealer.  Like, everyone's trying to bust the dealer.  So it's almost like if he busts the dealer, then you all win.  Yeah, if he would have done something with his 13 where he pulls this miraculous card and wins and everyone else loses because the dealer busted, screw him for winning. 
[00:53:30]  He screwed the table.  We all would have won, but he, like, didn't play by the community rules.  But why don't you guys acknowledge when this guy is playing stupid and everybody wins on the table where you acknowledge, like, okay, cool, this guy is a dope, but we all won because of it.  But you can't consistently bet.  It screws up your rhythm.  Like, I sit there thinking, I'm not going to bet $6,000 based on the fact that this jerk might do something stupid. 
[00:54:00]  I can't place my fate in my hand on whether this guy is going to be an idiot or not.  Was he betting big money, too?  No!  What's the amount of the table?  It was, I think I was playing $100 minimum table and $6,000 max.  All right, man, calm down.  But no, because you've got to understand, this guy, my mother said that.  She goes, my mother was watching for a while.  She goes, you turn into, like, a different person when you're doing that. 
[00:54:30]  She goes, I've never seen you like that.  Because I'll be like, son of a, god damn it!  All right, calm down.  So what happened?  And I punch Keith.  Keith is sitting next to me.  And I'll lean over and I'll punch him.  And I'll be like, oh, I'm sorry, Keith.  And he goes, no, that's okay.  That's okay.  And then he goes, I have to leave my wife here.  He goes, you know, I don't want to come back and see her with a bloody nose and, you know, split lip or anything.  So don't beat up my wife. 
[00:55:00]  All right, so you dipped and then what happened?  So I dipped.  It was pretty bad.  A big dip?  A big dip.  So I cashed in.  I didn't cash in.  I just left the tables Saturday night and it was a horror.  I just went back.  I emptied, like, maybe $100 out of my pocket.  I was like, oh, boy, this is a bad one.  Bad.  And then Sunday morning comes around, afternoon.  I go to another table.  It's looking grim again. 
[00:55:30]  And then it changed.  Completely turned around.  One dealer gets up within two shoes.  I had 45 minutes left.  45 minutes before I had to get from the car to the plane.  And rake to the guy to the point where Keith is standing next to me.  And he just looks.  He goes, count that.  Very, yeah.  Oh, he was rough.  So I count it.  He grabs the chips and goes, okay, here, play with this like daddy. 
[00:56:00]  And he just put them in his shirt and in his pockets and walked to the window, cashed in.  And I wound up pretty much a little less, but pretty much even for the whole trip.  And with everything they gave us, all the perks that they gave us, they gave us like $5,000 of just go shop money.  So the girls went to the spa, they bought dresses, jewelry, all kinds of stuff.  Just for the hell of it.  Oh, man. 
[00:56:30]  Beautiful rooms.  It was great.  They see dollar signs in your eyes, man.  It was, it was, I gotta say.  And with the big finish, dragging in a boatload of cash like that at the end, it was one of those picture-perfect weekends.  And then we got on the plane.  It was a wonderful flight back.  From the time we left the casino to the time I was back playing Call of Duty 4 with Dan, it was about an hour.  An hour from casino to my house. 
[00:57:00]  When they go through all that trouble and you still break even, they probably want to send John Denver to fly you home.  Yeah, I'm sure they do.  How annoying that must be for the casino.  Very annoying.  Did you break even?  They gave me everything, too.  They gave me the rooms, the dinners.  We had dinners at great restaurants twice.  It was all taken care of.  We go down to this dress store and Keith's wife and my girl, they're buying dresses and all kinds of stuff.  It was amazing.  It was a great weekend.  I want to thank Mohegan. 
[00:57:30]  And you broke even, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When do they want you back?  That's the problem.  Anytime, bro.  I think we're all going back for the Bon Jovi concert.  And another thing, you saw, what, Ozzy was up there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ozzy was playing Saturday night up there.  So a lot of Ozzy fans.  But kind of put a few things into perspective to see guys with Ozzy shirts and Ozzy jackets on driving little rascal scooters around the casino.  It was a little sad. 
[00:58:00]  And it's fans of, like Ozzy.  And they're there on those little rascal scooters.  You know what a rascal scooter is?  Whether they're too fat or too, like, old or hip injuries and stuff.  With an old Black Sabbath t-shirt on or something.  Yeah, he's got the old Sabbath t-shirt and the mullet going and just driving around.  Ozzy should be on a rascal.  Yeah, he should be.  Did you see him at all?  No, no.  He played in the big room, obviously.  And the big arena that we did when we went up there. 
[00:58:30]  And I didn't see him.  Saw a lot of his fans, though.  A couple of them fans of the show.  Very nice.  And then just had a really good time.  Very good.  I'll be back.  Martin from Jersey.  Martin.  Oh, here he goes.  Hi, guys.  All right, Mr. Doesn't Know Blackjack.  What?  What's the problem?  This is Anthony.  The guy takes the bad player.  He's in the back of you in front of you.  It doesn't matter.  He takes the cards from the deck so you get the next card. 
[00:59:00]  It doesn't affect you.  Dude, it does.  Shut up.  You're talking out your butt.  You don't know what you're talking about.  I hate people that say this.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You're not a blackjack player.  You're not.  You're one of these idiots that sit down and screw everybody at the table.  Patrick, what's your name?  Yes.  Patrice.  If you were in the middle of the game.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Know nothing.  Wow.  Hey, let me ask you. 
[00:59:30]  He's losing his mind.  I love him.  Is there another level?  Are you at the highest level blackjack player?  If there's some level where it's the highest level players, could you comfortably sit down  with those people and know what you're doing?  Would you ever be the cowboy hat guy?  Never.  In any situation.  Never.  I will explain the next level.  If Anthony and his fellow players that yell at the cowboy hat player are not card counters, 
[01:00:00]  then they are losers because the odds will crack them eventually.  Will crack who?  Will crack Anthony and his fellow players.  Oh, he said you're not a card counter.  That's your problem.  Dude, the odds will crack me.  As opposed to the odds cracking the entire table because idiot isn't hitting on a 13 when  the deal is showing a 10.  As opposed to the house, I think he means.  Of course.  What do you think?  The odds are in the player's favor? 
[01:00:30]  What am I, a retard?  Of course the odds are in the house's favor.  What am I, stupid?  Wait, what about...  Get Anthony a value of somebody.  Every game in a casino is based on the fact that the odds are in the house's favor.  If it was the other way around, casinos would be little tin shacks.  They're beautiful places with stunning, gaudy crap hanging everywhere that people pay for.  The trick, the trick is to try to get lucky and try to play the games where the odds are 
[01:01:00]  best in your favor or to get the best odds you can.  There's no reason to yell at me because...  I'm yelling at you because you're talking, you're talking out the part of you that is  supposed to expel waste.  I used to have a video game, a casino video game.  And it was, to me, it seemed like craps was the best way to win.  You can win...  You say the blackjack.  Blackjack has the best odds, right? 
[01:01:30]  Blackjack has the best odds, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Like, craps has so many different ways to win, right?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you saying?  No, it doesn't?  It doesn't.  What game has the best odds?  If you set the line and pick the odds on the craps table.  And it's got like a 1.4% chop against you.  I've always heard blackjack has the best odds.  All right, hold on.  This guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about, though.  I have no idea about craps. 
[01:02:00]  I don't play craps.  Just like this guy doesn't play blackjack correctly.  He's an ass.  Cowboy-headed idiot.  Why are you getting so mad at it?  Oh, because he's one of those guys.  He's talking to this guy like he is the cowboy hat guy.  Yeah.  This is what he wants to say.  That's what I wanted to say to the cowboy hat guy.  Let it be known there are a lot of guys that agree with Anthony, but I don't think they're  yelling and screaming, though.  I'm not saying he's a proxy for him, but I think he's a moron, too.  That's not the point. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  The point is, does it affect your play?  Yes, it does, jackass.  Okay.  It affects the entire table.  First of all, you can't consistently bet.  You can't play the way you want to play when an idiot is playing like a hot shot cowboy.  You can't then, I don't want to put my friggin' $6,000 in this idiot's hands.  I want to play against the dealer, not against the idiot next to me. 
[01:03:00]  Let him go.  Jackass.  Jerk off.  Idiot.  Are you feeling okay?  I'm fine.  I was in a great mood.  Mr. Coombe, let me ask you this.  Yes, sir.  Patrice.  So this guy, the cowboy hat guy, right, he goes, I'm not going to do this.  Now, if he doesn't hit, now you have to adjust what you're going to do now with your hit.  Let's say you had a 15.  No, I'll always just do what I'm going to do. 
[01:03:30]  All right, he has his 13, and let's say you have a 15.  Yep.  He doesn't bet.  What do you do different now that he doesn't bet as opposed to if he did hit?  Nothing.  I play the game.  If the dealer's showing a picture card up top and I got a 15, I'm hitting the goddamn thing.  I'm hitting it.  Instead of getting the first card, you're getting the second card.  And then everyone looks around the table and goes, what would the dealer have gotten if this moron would have hit?  Oh, he'd have busted instead of gotten 21.  So now he's F the entire table. 
[01:04:00]  But you guys don't acknowledge when it works out in your favor.  That's what I don't get.  You sort of acknowledge it, but you're like, no.  You also don't understand what I was saying.  I don't want to put my six grand in his hands.  He's saying this guy.  I put it in the dealer's hands.  I'm playing against the goddamn dealer.  Not against an idiot that doesn't know how to play the effing game.  But isn't it all luck of the cards anyway, though?  Yes, but the percentages.  You want to play the odds and the percentages. 
[01:04:30]  And it works out better if idiot hits.  Okay.  Well, for the table.  Shut up, you fucking moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  All right.  Why are you cursing?  Why are you losing your mind?  Because I can't take this guy anymore.  Why are you losing my mind?  I can't take him anymore.  Or I thought gambling was just, you know, just fun.  A fun recreation.  It's fun until you get this idiot.  Because he's one of these idiots. 
[01:05:00]  But is he...  Dude, how many times do guys want to punch you in casinos?  He's out.  Never.  They never do.  Boom.  They want to beat you silly.  But is this guy talking like the cowboy hat?  Yeah.  They think they're right.  They're not.  He's not right.  He's an idiot.  He's an idiot.  He's an idiot.  All right.  You got to do just private games from now on.  That's what I do.  Me and the dealer.  Or I go into the high roller game.  He doesn't gamble for fun like we do.  Or I go into the high, high stakes game. 
[01:05:30]  And everyone knows how to play there.  You're not going to...  And this proves my point.  If you go into the high stakes game where it's 500, 10,000.  500 minimum, 10,000 maximum.  You won't find one son of a bitch sitting there doing what he said is fine to do.  Not one.  And they throw your ass right out of there.  So you guys must be winning like crazy because you don't have these guys getting in your way.  You win or you lose based on how the game is played.  So who do you blame?  Guarantee this jerk, he never goes home a winner. 
[01:06:00]  Never.  Who do you blame when the high stakes guys are losing?  The game.  It's just the way it goes.  I'm not saying it's a sure thing if idiot isn't sitting there.  I'm not stupid.  The odds are always in the house's favor.  But the odds are even more in the house's favor when jerk is sitting next to you.  Believe me.  I've seen it too many times.  Hold on.  We got to get to Lydia from Oceanside.  She calls every once in a while.  She's a psychologist.  Lydia. 
[01:06:30]  Hi, guys.  I'm just a little worried about answering.  Everyone's worried about me.  Please.  Is it about the gambling or the fact that I'm a Nazi?  What is it now?  Well, I have a Jew, so the Nazi thing does worry me a little, but I thought maybe you could  use a little deep breathing technique and relax.  I know about deep breathing.  Steve from Bayshore.  Ant was sitting at the table screaming that his generals were betraying him. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not Hitler.  Why are you worried, Lydia?  Well, you know, I play blackjack, too, and I agree with Anthony.  I've been to Mohegan Sun with the idiots, but I'm just wondering if he's going to have  a heart attack or stroke on the air, you know?  No, I get very worked up, that's all.  He loves his gambling.  He wants to go the right way.  I enjoy playing blackjack.  Played the right way.  It's very exciting when you get a good hand that you can split, that you can double down. 
[01:07:30]  Things like that.  But that's where the fun of the game comes in.  So basically, you could sleep better at night if you knew that you lost a lot of money,  but everyone at the table was playing by the, quote, rules.  The unspoken rules.  That's how it works.  I'm trying to understand this.  If idiot sits next to me.  Where did you get your gambling chops?  Like, so that you feel comfortable being this guy screaming a cowboy hat.  Experience.  Just playing.  Just playing.  And I knew the rules going in.  But you was a cowboy hat guy at one time. 
[01:08:00]  I was never a cowboy hat guy.  I knew the basic rules to sticking and hitting.  But that's part of the game.  The other part is no one went to split cards.  No one went to double down, even though not just on 11s.  You know, you double down certain times.  Also, when you have crappy cards, if the deal is showing crappy cards, you could do that, too.  Try to double your bet.  But, uh, idiots like that guy that think it's fine to just sit there and stick, uh, on a 13 when the dealer is showing a face card is, uh, despicable. 
[01:08:30]  Despicable!  Everyone hates people like that, aren't they?  And, yes, the fact that everyone hates them.  And they screw up the game.  And, and, and like I said, it might work out for the best.  But the biggest thing is it screws up the bettors, the whole table's rhythm of betting.  Because you get paranoid that this idiot is going to take your money away by screwing up the table instead of just playing against the dealer.  I don't get how he screws the table up. 
[01:09:00]  I know.  I know.  I'm just on cover.  A lot of, a lot of hardcore gamblers believe exactly like Anthony Boyd.  Is it superstition?  No!  You should, it's math, it's odds.  You shouldn't even take a chance playing at a public table then.  You should go private table all the time.  Sometimes I play at the lower stakes table if I just want to take a break.  Drink a few beers, take a break without the, you know, the constant adrenaline of huge bets.  Things like that.  But there's just always a jackass.  Then you get more cowboy hat guys. 
[01:09:30]  Right, exactly.  Alright, Lydia.  Bye, guys.  There she goes.  You get some little guy from Thailand smoking 80 cigarettes.  Hitting when he's not supposed to, sticking when he's not supposed to.  He's having fun.  Eh.  I take that cigarette, spin it around, and stick it in his eye.  Alright, wait a minute.  So there's many different levels of gambling.  Like Jimmy, myself, Patrice, we've done the three cards.  You're just fooling around, having fun.  Whatever.  Play a little blackjack, fooling around, having fun.  It's fun.  Who gives a crap?  I did the three card broker thing. 
[01:10:00]  It was fun.  You talk mess to the dealer.  You go, aha, when they lose.  Yeah.  And then after a while, you just feel creepy.  Yeah.  Sitting there.  Well, then you leave.  Then you want to move on to something else.  But then there's gamblers like Anthony.  They take it very seriously.  I just, I enjoy playing blackjack.  One more time.  Mm-hmm.  Three people at the table.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're killing me.  Wait a minute.  Just wait a second here.  Yeah.  It's your lack of knowledge on the game.  It's just.  Because I don't want to be, I don't want to be cowboy hat guy. 
[01:10:30]  Mm-hmm.  Thirteen, you, the other guy.  The cowboy hat guy, you, da-da-da.  Right.  Okay.  Thirteen, he should hit.  Yeah.  Because ultimately, what's going to happen?  Now, tell me the scenario in the cards of why you want him to hit.  It offsets every card by one.  He should hit because there's a magic card under there.  Jesus Christ.  I'm just asking, man.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:11:00]  Because.  Because what happens.  A very high.  A very high.  And give me a scenario from him not hitting to you losing.  I'll tell you.  A high percentage of the time that dealer, if he's showing a picture card, has something  higher than a 13.  It's, first of all, stupid for him not to hit.  Because they usually got another picture card under there, a 20, or a 9, or an 8, or a 7.  It's a card that's going to beat you.  Right.  Take the goddamn card.  He doesn't hit. 
[01:11:30]  Now I got a hit.  Now I'm getting his goddamn card.  I don't want his card.  I want my card.  If I got a big bet, I don't want his card.  I don't want him to determine if I win or lose.  Unless his card gives you a win.  Jesus Christ.  I'd like to know, statistically, what are the odds of you getting a good card because  he sucks, or a bad card because he sucks are probably the same.  Like, if you have a 10, you don't know if you're going to get a 7 or an 8 after him. 
[01:12:00]  It's basically just, it's a psychological thing because mathematically, like, what are  the odds that he's, like, the cards are random.  Like, I know what you're saying, but I think it's more psychological.  Like, you know this guy sucks.  So if you have a jack showing or whatever, and then you get a 2, you're like, I hope  this guy dies in a bus wreck.  But if he gives you 21, you're like, good, that just worked out for the better.  Sometimes it does.  And you still hate him.  Yeah.  He's not playing the game right.  Honestly, we'll have to agree to disagree.  It's just the way people like Anthony thinks. 
[01:12:30]  That's what, and like I said, you go into the high roller room.  He's not alone.  And you play like that.  He's not alone.  They'll get thrown out.  They'll throw you out bodily if you play like that in the high roller room with other  people at the table.  What if you're winning?  Doesn't matter.  No one would do that.  That's what I'm talking about.  When do you not hit?  What do you have to have to not hit?  Anything.  Where you don't call him a jerk.  17 or over, or if the dealer is showing a six or under. 
[01:13:00]  Okay.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Then I won't hit.  We're really late.  That's it.  Sometimes you split.  Take a deep breath, Anthony.  I hit on 20.  I laugh.  Give me an ace.  Yeah.  Give me an ace.  Just to see how the table reacts.  Give me an ace, Ace.  I split Queens against 10s.  Watch this.  An ace.  Hit me with an ace right here.  A six comes out, and I'm like, ah!  Maybe that's time.  Close, but no cigar.  I hit on a 20.  That's right.  That's what I do.  And that's what you say. 
[01:13:30]  You say, give me an ace, Ace, and you wink at the other players.  Just for giggles.  We got to take a quick break.  When a six comes out, you see.  We're real late.  We're going to talk a little football after the break.  And, you know, Jimmy's Cowboys lost last night.  And we got T.O. crying audio.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  You calm in?  You calm?  You all right?  Yeah.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in because we thought we were going to have a snow day.  We thought Jimmy wasn't going to make it back from his Diana Ross concert last night. 
[01:14:00]  Well, you never know, though.  It's always good to have Patrice in here no matter what.  I got to show you some of the footage.  I wish I had a better camera.  You've never seen gayer people.  Really?  Including you.  Let's be honest.  Am I gay?  I was with a girl.  I love the beard.  Would you light her up as she's singing?  Do you know?  Yeah, they must have looked at you.  Disgusted.  Oh, she did do that.  It was fantastic.  She opened with, not I Hear a Symphony, but My World is Empty.  That was nice.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, too.  Oh, wonderful.  I can picture your pink lips. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  You don't want any more blackjack calls, do you?  What?  What?  I won't even let it upset me.  All right, watch.  Let's see if this doesn't upset you, okay?  Rich in Jersey.  Rich?  All right, Rich.  Well, actually, I'm calling to agree with Anthony and trying to explain it to you guys.  Okay.  The sheer fact that it's a game of numbers.  If you play it like a jacket, well, I'm sorry.  If you play it like somebody who doesn't know, then you're just there to gamble and you should  be sitting at a poker table or something like that.  What? 
[01:15:00]  This guy makes me sick.  I know.  Swallow.  Well, no.  Spin it out, Mr. Peabody.  It's all numbers.  You know what I mean?  We know it.  It's a cause and effect game.  Well, everything's cause and effect.  He's not helping you, Anthony.  No.  No, I know.  He's making a fool out of you.  Yeah, I mean, if you want to just talk about just basic math crap, it would work either  way.  To me, the only non...  Well, no, it doesn't work either way because there's only a certain percentage of cards in  the deck.  Oh, you got another call coming in, idiot.  You got another call. 
[01:15:30]  Exactly, sir.  But thank you for trying to help me.  And hopefully if you're a cancer doctor saying bad news.  All right, let's go to Charlie in Westport, Connecticut.  Charlie.  Hey, what's going on, Charlie?  That's a game of number.  We did it.  While you're talking about it.  On what, Charlie?  I just want to explain to Jimmy what's going on.  There's three cards in the deck that equal 10 and one that equals 11.  What the hell?  There's four cards.  Why wouldn't you use those?  What are you going to do?  You're going to leave a 10 for the dealer and they're going to end up winning. 
[01:16:00]  The guys who told me, I just want to give Cowboy had a big F you.  Yeah.  No, no.  See, that's...  Now, the numbers like that, like what you're saying, like the numbers add up.  Like, you know how many cards are in the deck, right?  Like, as far as how many...  But there's like five cards, five shoots, five decks.  Decks.  Five decks of cards, right?  Seven decks, I think.  Okay, yeah.  So, sir, what are you trying to say?  That you can't double down like that?  All right, Charlie, what else you got?  We're moving on from the gambling thing. 
[01:16:30]  This is just driving in nuts.  I want to know if anybody's watching the playoffs when we know that those stupid dummies with  their bomb-looking coach who cheats are going to win the damn thing anyway.  It's a guarantee.  I guess this guy thinks the Pats are going to win, so why watch anything?  Well, the Pats are obviously going to win.  Yeah.  They're going to win.  Are you still obsessed with the fact that they cheated in the first game of the season,  even though every team's doing that?  I am not bitter about that, but I am a diehard. 
[01:17:00]  Why do you think it wasn't a big deal after a while?  Because the NFL knows every team did exactly what Belichick did and got caught doing.  Cheating.  Stop.  It's called watching game tape.  Dude, every team, I have to say, I hate the Pats, and I hate them, but they're one of  the best teams ever.  You can't say a team that's gone 19-0 and ran over people like they have is anything  but a great team, and they were obviously doing what other teams were doing.  I don't see anyone beating the Pats, obviously.  No one's beating them.  Now that it's down to what?  How many teams we got left? 
[01:17:30]  Four.  And it was the first game of the season.  And the dumb Jets went 2-19 or whatever the stupid record is.  The Jets stunk.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  How much cheating could you do filming what they were doing?  It's obvious that, well, whatever.  We've discussed it many times.  The NFL understands what's going on.  That's why it wasn't that big of a deal.  Pats looked unbelievable, even though it was a bit close there for a while.  The freaking Packers game in the snow was a lot of fun to watch.  Anyone watch that?  Go Pack Goal. 
[01:18:00]  You watched the Packers game there, Patrice?  No.  You didn't watch the snow game?  Patriots.  I was into the Patriots.  You didn't watch all the games, though?  No.  Why not?  I was driving to Long Island.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  We'll get into your Long Island experience a little later.  Oh, boy.  And then Jimmy's Cowboys lost to the Giants yesterday.  I don't know how you lose to the Giants in that game.  Well, me and Baby Doll have been talking about it on the breaks.  I'm sick to my stomach over every aspect of this team right now.  The horrible coaching with the team was not ready to play. 
[01:18:30]  The fruity tackling, that defense should be lined up and executed.  They should be shot dead for not tackling.  DeMarcus, what I was a...  Racky soccer team.  He did his job.  He did his job.  They weren't tackling.  They were pushing each other.  They were like flag football.  Faggots tackle each other.  I don't know, Norton.  There's a lot of things with that stupid Dallas Cowboy team.  Yes, they have a great quarterback.  Wire receiver. 
[01:19:00]  Great quarterback.  He's a terrible one.  He's fantastic.  I think Romo's really good.  Yes, he is in the regular season, like Alex Rodriguez.  Amazing.  But come crunch time...  But he's only been in one crunch time thing in his life.  I know.  Second time.  Well, last year...  That fumble, it was two inches from him being a hair.  No, exactly.  He's a ghost, like in the Peanuts carton.  She yanked the football away and she's a stupid chicken in the air.  Following your logic, Eli hasn't been in a lot of big games either.  Yeah, he's not a big...  And all you have to do is get to him and he panics in the freaking... 
[01:19:30]  They couldn't get to him yesterday.  I'm not blaming...  They gave him a lot of time in the pocket.  I'm not blaming Romo for the whole...  Believe me, the drop passes.  I wanted to sever hands for the way they were dropping passes.  And it was just...  He won't throw the ball away.  Like, he's running backwards.  Instead of throwing it away, he goes third and thirty.  But he only got sack one.  I think the...  I mean, give...  Give Giants a little credit.  For what?  For what?  For running, like in the opening drive on a penalty.  And then the guy... 
[01:20:00]  He makes a catch and they elbow him.  And go, alright, we want to fall down.  And he goes, no.  And he runs in for a touchdown.  Or how about that faggity prevent defense they play at the end of the first half?  That defense loses every time.  But that's the defense you play with 48 seconds when you're on the...  The opponent's one or whatever they started.  But it's not.  You blitz.  Knock them down.  You don't blitz when there's 48 seconds and you're on the 20.  They started at the 20.  I know.  And you don't...  You prevent.  And they prevented nothing. 
[01:20:30]  And they prevented nothing.  They prevented happiness in Dallas.  They cowboy-hatted.  Yeah, see?  There was a cowboy-hatted defense.  It was...  Cowboy-hatted people.  Highside 2020.  There's no way they should have.  And that 15-yard face mask, man.  When I see...  Anytime I see my team ahead and I see that three-man rush and the quarterback is lounging  just looking for options, I get sick.  Because it always works out badly.  But 48 seconds when they're on the 20, you do that. 
[01:21:00]  You give them 15 yards here, 10 yards here.  Sure.  Not 40.  And especially when you're not tackling.  They weren't tackling.  They were not tackling.  The special teams should also be put on a bus and driven into a river and just drown  like rats.  All hail the Patriots, I must say.  Boo.  Boo.  All hail the Patriots.  But you know what?  They win in big games.  You know what?  Stupid Tom Brady doesn't choke.  The team doesn't choke.  They're well-coached.  And they win.  You know what?  Moss had one reception on Saturday? 
[01:21:30]  One catch?  It doesn't even matter.  They didn't even need them.  Chargers don't have a prayer against the pass.  They have a prayer.  No, they don't.  Who are you kidding?  I thought they didn't have a prayer against the Colts.  They were a broken team that beat freaking Peyton.  But that whole, anybody who was worth anything was hurt for the San Diego time.  Yeah, I know.  They were a broken team and they found a, they're not going to do it two weeks in a row, though.  Do you think Dan Fouts is ready this week?  He's ready.  He's ready to suit up.  By the way, the New York Post front page, Giants stunner. 
[01:22:00]  And then it says Jess Jenks.  A lot of people blaming Jessica Simpson on the Cowboys loss.  They made a whole big deal about it in the last week or so.  She tackles better than most of them do.  I don't get that, man.  The New York Post, which is supposed to be a newspaper, they're doing morning zoo bits.  Yeah, that's exactly what this is.  Morning zoos do this type of thing.  Front page.  Right.  It's the entire front page of a New York City newspaper. 
[01:22:30]  And it's dedicated to one of their wacky stunts.  The front page is a Jessica Simpson lookalike that they sent to the game down there in Dallas.  It's a very homely one, to be quite honest.  Awful.  That's the worst looking.  She looks like Jessica Simpson if Jessica Simpson was stung by a bee in the face.  She looks like one of the Simpsons.  If she turns her face just right, she almost looks like Jessica Simpson.  She's got the Swayze disorder.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  We call it Patrick Swayze's brother.  It looks like Jessica Simpson's retarded sister.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Patrick Swayze.  And then you ever see Patrick Swayze's brother?  Yeah.  Kind of looks like a retarded Patrick Swayze.  That's what she looks like.  Anyway.  She's hearted Jessica Simpson.  So they put her in a cute pink Tony Romo jersey.  And she had really good seats.  I don't know how you get this.  She had like the third row.  And there's a picture in the post of Romo within eyesight of this Jessica Simpson lookalike. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, but I think he would look and just go, eh.  He would never notice.  There's a slob trying to look like my girl.  Well, everybody around this lookalike was taking pictures and stuff.  In the stands, they knew what was going on.  Yeah.  That someone was pulling some kind of stunt.  Turns out it's a newspaper, not a morning zoo show.  So, I mean, what do you think?  I think that the defensive coordinator should be shot.  I think that the special teams should be shot.  That's what I think. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  There's no way a pro athlete was distracted by it.  And his trip to Mexico, this is what kills me.  If this was his wife, what difference if he went to Mexico with his wife?  They would not be saying a word about it.  This is news because the news made it news.  Like, somebody made it news.  He went to Mexico with a chick.  Because if it was his wife, you would assume he'd be down there.  They'd sit on the beach, relax.  She'd rag him a little bit. 
[01:24:30]  Perhaps he'd leave, go somewhere else, hang out.  But it's Jessica Simpson, so all they're picturing is 24 hours of him having sex  and losing every bit of muscle tone from his legs and abdomen.  Which is exactly what happened, by the way.  Who are you kidding?  You get old shaky legs if you do that.  That's why boxers don't have sex when they're training.  I heard it takes months to recover from a good one.  I don't know about months, but I do know that if you have sex, 
[01:25:00]  your legs are not going to be what they could be if you didn't have sex.  You've got to be kidding me, man.  It's the way it is.  There's no way him hanging out with Jessica Simpson hurt his team.  It wasn't his fault.  It wasn't his fault they lost.  He didn't play great.  He didn't play awful.  He was okay.  It was just kind of there.  A lot of drop passes.  Exactly.  There really were.  A lot of good scrambles.  The dude, he made a great play where they almost caught,  and he flipped the ball to the dude.  Dude dropped it. 
[01:25:30]  Creighton.  That was great, yeah.  So who's in the Super Bowl?  Pats?  Patriots versus whoever goes.  You know what you want me to say?  It's not going to be the Giants.  They stink to high heaven.  It's going to be Green Bay and Patriots.  Yeah, I think it's the Packers.  Yeah.  I mean, the Giants just suck.  I mean, I'm trying to just talk through this,  but they're the worst team I've ever seen.  I'm pretty far off of luck then.  I mean, Plexico Burris and his weird-shaped face and Eli Manning. 
[01:26:00]  And I'm tired of the Manning family's face.  I've never seen the mother, but good God,  they couldn't make one good-looking person in that family.  A stretched-out funny-faced Manning family.  And all of our Monty Tumor is...  They weren't worried about looks in that family.  They were cloning quarterbacks.  Not good-looking people.  That fat tight end and that old straight hand and his white wife.  No white wife anymore. 
[01:26:30]  His divorced white wife.  Yeah, yeah.  All those Africans, human urine and googa-booga.  They stink.  And the worst of all is that coach, Tom Coughlin,  is the worst, mummified, personality-less nothing.  I do not want to see them anywhere near the playoffs  except for setting up the Patriots.  I would love to see the Giants and the Patriots  so they can beat them 87-1.  And that one point would just be...  I don't even know how you score one point. 
[01:27:00]  They'll kick a point after attempt with no touchdown.  Where Brady kind of gives you a safety  and they know he gave it to you,  so they're like, give him one on that.  It's Green Bay and Patriots  and people are going to be pushing for Green Bay.  That would be a great Super Bowl to watch, though.  Because you've got the Brett Favre thing.  Yeah, the 75-year-old Brett Favre.  Who's already saying he's not retiring after the season.  He's coming back.  One more.  His grayish, green beard and hair.  And that blockhead.  He's always trying to have fun throwing snowballs at his... 
[01:27:30]  Trying to just be one of the guys, you rich bum.  Yeah, it was kind of weird  that he's throwing snowballs in the middle of it.  A big game.  Just having fun.  Trying to make deals with God.  Shut up.  You're not better than me.  Patriots are going to beat you.  86-3.  Let's go to Jersey.  It's Dirk.  Dirk, you're on the...  Dirk.  Not Derek.  It's Dirk.  Dirk.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up? 
[01:28:00]  Listen, I just want to repeat what Anthony just said.  There's actually been a study done recently  where they said that  if you have sex before an athletic event,  participating in an athletic event,  after you recover from the sex,  which takes whatever time,  you know, a couple minutes, whatever,  they say you actually perform better  because you're actually much looser.  Well, apparently I'm just a big douche today.  No, you're not.  That's what I am.  Just a big, no-nothing douche.  You're looser, sir, because you're tired.  Your muscles are relaxed.  That might make you do great on a trivia,  but that doesn't make you throw a football farther 
[01:28:30]  or box better.  Otherwise, boxers would have figured...  Women, weakened legs.  Did you learn nothing from rock?  It is.  It's a...  It's all physical thing.  I think you can at least focus better  because you've got one less thing on your mind.  What?  I missed something.  No, that's okay.  I'm just standing.  Women, legs, weakened legs,  and they destroy you morally  and they just ruin the fiber of who you are as a man.  Oh, T.O.  Rip it down.  Let's go to Tom in Middletown.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Middletown.  I was just saying the same thing 
[01:29:00]  about what that guy Dirt just said  or whatever the hell his name was.  I'm an MMA fighter myself  through the mixed martial arts stuff,  and I saw that sports science show,  and they actually took Chris Bird,  a renowned boxer who was actually really good.  Used to be.  Had him have sex with his girl  and performed before and after,  and he actually punched better  and had more stamina after sex.  So I think that's a total myth,  to be honest with you.  Well, you know what? 
[01:29:30]  Just one guy?  How long after, though?  Then Romo should have thrown for 500 yards  and had 12 touchdowns.  Just imagine what he was...  Throwing the ball is a lot simpler  than punching people in the face.  I understand, but just imagine  what he was doing down there in Mexico  with Jessica Simpson.  That guy should have been a superhuman  by the time that game started yesterday.  I'll tell you what he was doing in Mexico.  Take rubber boots and jump in tapioca.  It sounded like that. 
[01:30:00]  If I had a girl like Jessica,  though, I would do the same thing,  but you know,  not all those guys get girls like that.  We got a couple of...  Good point.  All right, sir.  A couple of no-nos, though.  You know?  You hit them a couple times,  and then you go out there  and do your thing,  and then you should be all right.  I'm so sick of identifying  what was me.  Yeah.  Let's go to Scott in Tennessee.  You should be Z-Z-Z.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[01:30:30]  Hey.  My dad was a professional runner,  actually won a gold medal  several years ago,  and he was documented as saying  that he had had sex with my mom  the night before the race,  and so I don't believe Anthony's...  Well, how is he documented, sir?  Who documented him?  Is he saying your dad said that to you,  and you're trying to make it  sound more official?  No one cares about the last time  your dad porked your mother.  No, it's in a book.  It's been written in newspaper articles.  You can find it in Runner's World, 
[01:31:00]  all that.  All right, what's your dad's name?  Is this Sebastian Coe?  No, it's Dave Waddle.  Dave Waddle?  How fast could he be?  I remember Dave Waddle.  Wasn't he the one that ran with the hat?  Yeah.  That's my dad, man.  Oh, really?  Dave Waddle was a great runner.  Yep.  Yeah, he was...  I used to be in the running world.  I know all about Dave Waddle.  What is he doing now?  He is working at a college down in Memphis. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  Doing nothing.  Yeah.  So how...  Did he run marathons?  All right, go ahead.  So I didn't mean to ask the question.  Go ahead.  You continue with your dissertation.  I'll just quietly listen.  Sir, did he run marathons?  Uh, no, no.  Uh, 800 in the mile.  So half mile.  What Olympics?  I think it was like 72, 76?  72.  72.  72 Olympics.  Dave Waddle.  Yeah, he was known for...  Oh, he still wears his hat because he was known for it back then? 
[01:32:00]  I see a recent picture of your dad and he's got to wear the hat still.  Enough with the hat.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Oh, by the way, what have you become in life?  Oh, that would have been interesting.  His father was a gold medalist.  What is Scott doing in Tennessee?  Is that why he called?  Yeah, just to say about...  That his father, you know, had some sex before he won the gold medal.  The night before a big race, apparently the mother crawled in some type of an animalistic  mood.  And typical in woman fashion, didn't care that he had something to do the next day. 
[01:32:30]  I'm not saying it can't happen.  She just had to get what she needed.  God forbid he has to go out and earn the bread.  Yeah, who cares?  Dave Waddle.  Dave Waddle was very, very famous back in the early 70s.  John in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Screw you.  I like the Giants.  But anyway, you guys didn't get the best part of the whole game.  After the game, T.O. crying at a press conference.  We'll play that audio next.  Thanks for the setup, John. 
[01:33:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Weathermen in the New York area looking really, really stupid today.  That's all they talked about yesterday and Saturday, that it was going to be an ugly snowstorm  coming through the New York area.  I know Boston got their snow.  I know parts of Connecticut got their snow.  But down here, it was a major, major bust.  I mean, they had the crawls during the football games. 
[01:33:30]  And they were popping in.  They started school closing, what, last night, getting everyone ready.  And then we all woke up, looked outside the window and went, nothing.  There's nothing going on weather-wise.  And we got a few more examples of this because we love just showing you guys how awful the news really is.  How phony and stupid and just ratings driven and trying to get people to tune in by lying.  And I just hope we teach our job. 
[01:34:00]  I hope we teach some of our listeners out there that the news just sucks.  Yeah.  They're fear mongers.  They're very into the culture of fear.  And even if, well, a lot of these guys knew that the weathermen, wow, you just threw me off by looking at Katie.  What's up?  Who is it?  It's all right.  Sorry about that.  Patrice all of a sudden was like pointing like crazy to the TV and he just, it's fine.  Katie Holmes.  What's up with Katie Holmes?  You don't like her? 
[01:34:30]  Huh?  That's the point of that.  That was the whole reason I just looked at Norton and pointed.  She's beautiful, though.  She was good in one movie.  She's not anymore.  I'm scared to say how hideous I think she is because of how powerful Scientology is.  You don't think she's beautiful, really?  Oh, my God.  I think she's pretty.  I think she's pretty.  I think she's nuts to be with Tom Cruise and all that.  But just looking at her, I think she's a very good.  I don't like her.  Very good looking woman.  She's looking like, what's her face there?  I need white eyes.  I need Prince Valiant.  I need white guy eyes to even figure it out, man. 
[01:35:00]  She's tall and lean.  I don't want to get into it.  I think she's a pretty girl.  I think she's really pretty, man.  I don't think she's particularly sexy.  I think she's, like, I'd like to kiss her, but I don't get sexual thoughts when I see her.  Shirley from Three's Company is better looking.  Shirley?  Oh, my God.  Shirley Hemphill?  No, Shirley from.  Here.  Put that picture up on.  From Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, Penny Marshall.  Shirley, the other one.  Shirley Feeney.  All right.  The short hair might not be doing it, but look to your right there, Jimmy.  Put that picture on onaradio.com later today there, E-Rock. 
[01:35:30]  You don't think that's hot?  That's a while ago, though.  It's actually a very sexy photo.  That's before Tom Cruise erected.  For a kid, Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  She's, like, nuts now.  When are we interviewing the guy who wrote the book?  Sorry about that.  I didn't want to interrupt you.  Next week or this week.  It's all right.  It's not that big of a deal.  All I was going to say is that  a lot of people should understand  that most of these weather guys knew sometime yesterday  that this storm was going to be a bust,  but there's nothing in it for them to say that on TV  because they want you to continue watching their local news 
[01:36:00]  for storm coverage  because they've done all their research.  They know storm coverage gets a huge rating,  so why would they turn around and go,  you know what, guys?  Nothing to worry about here.  Go back to the football game.  Go back to this.  You don't have to tune us in anymore.  It's going to just be regular winter weather tomorrow.  And for the morning,  like, if they scare you the night before,  the first thing you're doing in the morning  is turning on the news.  Right.  To see what the storm is all about.  And even when the storm is obviously not happening,  they're still not willing to give up on the whole thing.  No.  They suck. 
[01:36:30]  Here's a...  We got another example, by the way.  So this is what the local news here in New York  was saying about the storm yesterday.  We have several reports this evening  on what you can expect from this storm,  but we begin with the Eyewitness News AccuWeather team,  Lee Goldberg and Heidi Jones,  tracking this changing storm.  We start with Lee.  Changing.  Sandra, we are in a critical time with this storm right now.  It's really do or die.  The storm is doing everything it can  by strengthening to cool this storm down  and change the rain over to snow. 
[01:37:00]  There you go.  Oh, God.  What an overdramatic idiot.  And then, of course, we fast forward.  This is what they're saying this morning.  On the roads in and around Manhattan,  there really isn't an accumulation of snow.  But further north, up here in Rockland County,  as you can see,  there is about an inch of snow on the ground.  And on the roads here,  it is a mixture of both rain and slush,  so drivers really need to be careful.  There really isn't an accumulation of snow.  Yeah.  You could say that in July. 
[01:37:30]  There really isn't.  There's none.  Yeah.  There was none snow.  None.  None.  They can't say that, though.  Because then you're not going to watch.  What's the question?  It may not be six inches of snow,  but this storm is still a mess  and a danger to drivers on the road  heading to work this morning.  No, it won't.  To decrease the hazard,  salt trucks in New Jersey and New York  have been loading up  and coating the roads before the snow does.  For the rest of the country listening to us,  I can't stress enough.  We're looking at, like, just wet streets out there. 
[01:38:00]  Not a bit of snow out there.  The temperature on the way in,  on my drive in,  never got below 37 degrees.  So it wasn't even cold enough for snow, basically.  Nothing was freezing.  Right.  The roads were wet,  and that was it.  There was no ice.  There was no slush.  It wasn't treacherous driving.  I did the same speed I do every day.  Light speed.  It's about 80.  That's nothing for you. 
[01:38:30]  It's just a wet road.  Right.  Slow down a little around curves.  You want another example?  This is kind of interesting, right?  This is what they were saying yesterday.  Because of the storm,  we've got alternate side of parking rules  suspended for tomorrow.  Our team coverage right now  continues with Andre Hopkins.  He's on the west side  with what else the city is doing  to get ready.  Andre.  Karen, New York City's  Department of Sanitation  canceled all days off and vacations  and called in a whole bunch of people  who started about three hours ago.  They'll work until 8 o'clock  in the morning on these roads,  and they'll be replaced by people 
[01:39:00]  who will start at 7 o'clock  in the morning  and will work through the afternoon.  Soul trucks.  They're just going to, like,  back over edamame.  Right.  Stupid idiots.  Margarita glasses.  I was doing 60 last night  in a rage.  Yeah.  In a rage,  and I didn't slip once.  No.  Well, what's the corporate plan  behind not just saying,  look, we didn't mess up fully.  It went to Boston,  but we thought it was going to hit here,  and God decided  it was going to do something else.  God decided they should say that. 
[01:39:30]  Whatever the case,  but they just go,  hey, you know,  it happens,  and you know it happens,  and we...  No, they don't want to acknowledge that.  This was it, though.  If you look at Boston,  this was it,  but it just didn't happen.  Right, well,  and that's why they moved  all the New York weathermen north  until they found actual snow,  so it looks pretty impressive on TV.  And then you fast forward,  this is what they were saying this morning.  The rain and snow  stopped coming down  about a half hour ago,  but there are dozens of plow trucks  here on the roads  passing us by  looking for any snow  that might have accumulated  on the road. 
[01:40:00]  They're just looking.  Ah, where's the snow?  And you know what?  To make up for it,  they're going to have these trucks  that just throw rocks  all over the street  that hit my truck.  Yep.  I mean, they just sling.  I don't even know  what they call them,  but it's just...  It spins.  There's a fan at the bottom  of the truck,  and it just spins  small rocks everywhere.  And you're passing  and you just see a...  All right.  We got one more.  It's worth playing.  One more.  This is what they were saying  about the big storm  in New York City yesterday.  The city is bracing 
[01:40:30]  for this overnight storm  that could wreak havoc  on morning rush hour  when many of us  are heading either  to work or school.  Christina Penza is live  now in Woodside  with more on the snow preps.  Christina.  Well, you may be able  to see some of this  heavy rain behind me.  It started in just  the last few hours.  Now, we are here  in the parking lot  of a home supply store.  There were people here  tonight preparing  for the storm,  but others admit to me  that they are not prepared  and they could be in  for a surprise 
[01:41:00]  in the morning.  Yeah, the surprise is  no storm.  No storm, no snow, nothing.  And once again,  I'll say it.  As they're doing  that report last night,  they knew that this  was going to be a bust.  They knew.  They knew, but there's  nothing in it for them  to turn their whole  opinion around or whatever.  Their whole...  What?  It's lovely out.  Yeah.  It's lovely.  Yeah.  For winter, it's not a bad day.  Not at all a bad day.  And then this morning,  they changed their tune.  Thank you so much.  Well, of course,  as we've been reporting,  the snow has been limited,  but it certainly still  could cause some problems 
[01:41:30]  for commuters.  Yeah, luckily,  a lot of people wake up  early when they know  that they're going to have  something that could  be affecting our commute.  Let's check a look  at our rails right now  so if there's any problem  with the third rail,  snow covering that area.  The LIRR, New Jersey Transit,  Metro North reporting  no problems at this hour.  We are keeping our eye  on the rails this morning.  Here in front of Penn Station,  just a light rain  is falling on us.  It actually picked up  a little bit  from the last hour,  so we're seeing  a little added precipitation,  but no big snow accumulations.  We did have that  heavy snow warning  in effect for New York City.  I hate her guts. 
[01:42:00]  No snow at all.  All of them are saying  no big accumulations.  We're not seeing  a lot of snow in the area.  And then someone  is panicking  in the back room  going,  we'll check the railroad,  the third rail.  All right,  the third rails  could get covered with snow.  How are they doing?  No, the rails are fine.  I think you need  close to a foot of snow  for the third rail  to possibly be effective.  And they knew  ahead of time  there was just flurry,  so why would  the third rail  be affected?  Is this amazing?  They want it so bad. 
[01:42:30]  Jimmy, does the local news  like talking about weather?  They really don't like  talking about weather.  They love it!  And I love the fact  they have team coverage.  Team coverage.  One person's not enough.  No.  Team.  Team coverage.  A whole team  to get it wrong.  Yeah, well.  And then,  you want to keep going  because now we're  into this bit.  Oh, yeah.  I love this.  This is what they were  saying last night.  City leaders are preparing  for several inches  they say will make  the ride on the roads rough.  That's why they want 
[01:43:00]  people to prepare  in each borough.  At this Christina supermarket  on the west side  of Manhattan,  Danielle Vreeland  grabbed up a bunch  of groceries  just in case weather  causes her to stay  home and work.  Yeah, I mean,  just breakfast,  lunch,  snack here or there.  She should probably  pick up some popcorn  or a blockbuster  or something like that.  We have five cats  and usually they  try to take them.  So you share these  donuts with your cats?  Maybe.  Maxwell Aronson  plans to stay home  and eat these donuts  if the fifth grader  gets to stay home  from school.  As that story  was being done, 
[01:43:30]  a suicide bomber  should have just  ran in between all  and mercifully  ended that.  Mercifully ended  that piece.  Stupid kid.  I give donuts  to my cats.  I hate you.  Either one of you  should make it to 18.  All right.  And this is what  they were saying  this morning,  a little different.  And we're talking  about New York,  by the way.  We're getting people  calling in Boston.  We understand  you got snow somewhere.  We know.  Sure, it's snowing  in Siberia. 
[01:44:00]  Being extra careful  and preparing  for the worst.  Got some salt  to make sure  the sidewalk is clear.  Got some more  windshield wiper fluid  so I don't get  in any accidents  in the morning.  Well, you still do  want to use  some extra care  on the roadways.  The roadways are wet  throughout a good majority  of the tri-state area  and we do still have  that snow coming down  in Connecticut.  And of course,  those bridges  and overpasses  do tend to freeze first.  So give yourself  a few extra minutes  to use some extra care  out on the roadways.  The one person  who was standing on snow,  there was a moose  right behind her. 
[01:44:30]  In Canada,  lying horse.  They're the worst.  Alright, one more  and then we'll move on finally.  What did Sam do last night?  All he did was watch the news?  I came in and I go,  we got to get audio of this  because it's just amazing  what they do to us  every time there might be a storm.  They scare the hell  out of everybody  and then when it's a bust  they still can't admit  that nothing's going on.  So this is what  they were saying yesterday.  This is the final one.  A mountain of salt  ready  for a city of snow.  Sanitation workers  prepare to pounce 
[01:45:00]  on tonight's winter storm.  It's now around 4.30  and all of the city's  353 salt spreaders  are plowed up  and ready to go.  They should be hitting  the streets  around midnight.  New York City's  Sanitation Department  expects the Bronx  to be the hardest hit borough.  They're ready to shift  more of their  3,000 workers there  if needed.  I thought we were  talking about snow.  No snow at all. 
[01:45:30]  Not at all.  The Bronx  could never have been  more suited for Puerto Ricans  than sunny.  80 degrees.  And then finally  this is what  they had to say  this morning.  We are still  watching the snow  come down  around parts  of the Tri-State  and in fact  I was just looking  at the Times Square  camera  still some flakes  flying  even in Midtown  so yes  we're not quite  done yet  but still  it could have  been a lot worse  had there been  more ample cold air  but that just  wasn't the case.  What we see right now  over the east end  of Long Island  that's where there  are some showers 
[01:46:00]  still going for New York  yeah  that's primarily rain  there's just a little bit  of snow in the mix there  slushy spots on the roadways  is pretty much all  we're talking about  a coating out there  and that's about it.  There  I gotta make you understand  there's no snow  none  none  might be confused  if you're listening  on BCN right now  but we're talking  about New York  and they prepared  us for nothing  a mountain of salt  for a mountain  of snow  this lie  on God 
[01:46:30]  that these weather  people did  is why I had to  get up at 4 in the morning  because they thought  Norton was going to be  suck  Norton wasn't going to  make it  well Steve  are you going to  make it  Steve acts like  I was doing a gig  on Mount St. Helens  I was saying  after I found this out  you know Steve  just texted me  like hey  you know Norton  might be  yeah  they were saying  over a foot of snow  starting right around  the time  poor little Jimmy Norris  hitting the New Jersey  turnpike back to New York  the deep impact 
[01:47:00]  media  couldn't have kept  Norton  out of  from Jersey  to here  I got the same text  at Mohegan  from Steve  are you going to be  able to make it  I'm like  I'm on my way  to the airport  the stars are out  it's a beautiful evening  there's nothing  on the runway  I would have been  more delayed  sliding on someone's  dandruff  than on that snow  there's nothing  it's gross  text text  is it okay  and I got super dark  shades  like the shades 
[01:47:30]  that just keep  like you know  nose for rocks  Dracula shades  so I'm like  oh man  I did pull the shades  up to see  this horrible snow  I said what the  it was  it was  you can see  the melt  it just melted  and it was  it was the weak snow  that you go  this  it was melting  it was  it was nothing  but I got  whatever  and they brag about  their weather machines  and you know  they  you know  they got nothing  I like the ifs  but if this line 
[01:48:00]  would have come down  we would have seen  a lot of snow  in our area  it didn't  New York  never shut down  by anything  snow shuts New York  down  for maybe a second  once every five years  it used  no wait  and it used to  like they  they weren't ready  for that crap  back then  now  you know  it's not just  the garbage trucks  that they hook  the plows up to  they do  they have a  load of plows  they plow the streets  really quickly now  it's not like  back in the 70s  when they were broke 
[01:48:30]  and didn't have anything  depending on what  neighborhood you live in  even the bad neighborhoods  get plowed pretty quickly  these days  they plow the snow  to the bad neighborhoods  do they do that  they push it from  lower west side  to Harlem  they do that  the whole way  they do that story  every year man  where like  in your neighborhood  it looks like  it's springtime  because it's not  a hint of snow  and then in some  of these other  neighborhoods  they're still snowed in  where they going  come on  let's be real  on Park Avenue  they helicopter  the snow out  and dump it 
[01:49:00]  in Queens  you know what  they do that  in Times Square  you know  a day after a snowstorm  they have a melter  you can't even tell  it's snowed  they have melters  they gotta keep  that area moving  it dumps it  right into the sewer  too much money  coming in from the tourists  so yeah  that's right  they bring up  these melters  big heated dump trucks  and these big  like bulldozers  pick the snow up  dump it into  the heated dump truck  and it melts  and it goes down  the drain  it's amazing  just to keep  Times Square going 
[01:49:30]  he's checking  his weather  system right now  the Doppler  300  no precipitation  I see you being  stranded  in Atlantic City  I know  like I was  in Florida  during a tornado  there was nothing  that could have  kept you from  New York City  I actually drove  south for a little  while then  sped back north  even faster  it's gonna have you  we're gonna find out  what happened  to you at  the governor's  after  we heard that  was pretty  interesting  your triumphant  return to Long 
[01:50:00]  Island  also  horses named  Opie and Anthony  in a bit of trouble  I saw that on the  Google News  we'll try to get to  that after the break  and then there was  a couple of  oh  what was the other  thing  there was another  huge story  I can't remember  now  and also  did you guys hear  about the father  who raped his son  and this is a true  story right there  as a punishment  for raping his  daughter  wow  holy mother  of god  we got the story 
[01:50:30]  next  but first  because we  promised this  and people  getting a little  pissed off  T.O. crying  son rapes  the daughter  father rapes  the son  yeah  everybody wins  wow  I believe so  we'll get to  the details  of that  in just a bit  and fall guy  the guy who  fell 500 feet  ta da  the guy who  fell 500 feet  is now talking  Jimmy  what's he saying  no he wants  to be in rehab  immediately  because he wants  to walk as soon  as possible  and the doctor's  like whoa  you got a lot  more operations 
[01:51:00]  what did you  say he said  we'll get into  that story  but first  we teased it  so let's play  it's Terrell  Owens having a  bit of a breakdown  after the Cowboys  lost yesterday  you guys can point  the finger  at him  you can talk  about  the vacation  and if you do  that  it's really  unfair  it's really  unfair  it's my team 
[01:51:30]  it's my  quarterback  you guys do  that man  it's unfair  we lost  other team  we lost  other team  man  you can act  like a man  what's the  matter with you  I'm disgusted 
[01:52:00]  wow  he's no crying  in football  you really  shouldn't just  keep that to  yourself  Ricky Schroeder  didn't look up  to champ  he's my  quarterback  shut up  that was just  weird  it was awful  it was awful  I don't think  T.O. was  right in the head  anyways  he's mad  got all sorts  of stuff  going on  it's that same  Dennis Rodman  thing  every five  minutes  you're crying  about something  you shouldn't  be  all the damage  you cause  you're doing  sit-ups 
[01:52:30]  in parking  lots  destroying  people's  lives  and you're  crying over  this idiot  and Jessica  Simpson  just  with big  weird  dark  glasses  yeah  he had  those big  dark  glasses  on  probably  all  puffy  eyed  because  he's  been  crying  all night  if you watch  somebody  do an interview  and you go  okay  you read it  and you go  I can pinpoint  where he was  going to cry  it would have  been there  it just seemed  like  it's just a  strange place  to cry  does he have  rage issues 
[01:53:00]  T.O.?  yeah  nah  he's a  he's just  a  he's a  different kind  of guy  he goes into  some weird  defensive  he's like  a girl  you know  he's like  a weird  like he goes  into temper tantrums  which that's  what a girl  would do  maybe he's  manic depressive  like Jimmy  was saying  something's wrong  with him  maybe yeah  got a little  Britney in him  because I cry  at weird times  too  that's why  I'm saying  really bizarre  when do you cry  oh constantly  weird times  extreme home  makeover  never  Sunday nights  no  only if  I only cry 
[01:53:30]  if they actually  get what they  want  because I'm  disappointed  I want them  to make  the house  worse  put roaches  in it  I can't  watch  extreme  home  makeover  anymore  you cry  you get a  little teary  eyed bro  I don't know  about that  look at me  trying to  convince you  asses  I don't know  about that  there was a  family  yesterday  if someone  could help  me out  maybe get  some details  I didn't  think we  were going  to talk  about this  today  but they  had a  daughter  she was 
[01:54:00]  born  now it's  just funny  to me  this is  where I'm  effed up  because last  night I was  like wow  this is  pretty intense  kind of freak  was she  but now  that I talk  about it  now I have  to laugh  because it  is pretty  funny  they had  this daughter  she has  this disease  only 25  people in  the known  world  have it  and basically  as a baby  she would run  really hard  into stuff  fall down  and not cry  and they're  like wow  that's a little  weird because  she's bruised  up pretty bad  and she doesn't  cry at all  she would get  her shots  wouldn't cry  take it like  a man  nothing  no crying  so they go  to the doctor 
[01:54:30]  she can't  feel pain  unless it's  20 times  so let's say  a baby  would feel  a pinch  right  you would  have to  pinch that  baby  20 times  harder than  a normal  pinch for  them to  feel it  that's like  superhero  that's  fantastic  that's great  what they put  in the house  a spanking  machine  swings harder  than stupid  pop  with his big  right bicep  refrigerator  with a  baseball bat  with a  guy inside  and hits  her in the  face  with a  sledgehammer  and says  don't take  this pudding 
[01:55:00]  put down  the cookie  a black  woman with  real pointy  shoes  runs and  kicks her  in the  shins  for trying  to drink  bleach in  the bottom  of the  cabinet  what did  you do  I told  you  I told  you no  dessert  before  dinner  and nothing  she went  down  no crying  no crying  no crying  no crying  keep hitting  me  say nothing 
[01:55:30]  I'm not  gonna cry  nope  not a tear  give me the  test  nope  don't feel  it  go ahead  keep going  whatever dad  is that all  you got  come on  yeah  ooh  scary  ah  alright  maybe a little  bit  tiny bit  tiny bit  like a little  prick there  she'd run  into walls  like Herman  Munster  leave her  shape  silhouette  but a bad  baby  can I finish 
[01:56:00]  so then they go to the doctor  and it turns out she has some nerve ending thing  where it doesn't feel the pain  but here's the other side of that  you would think not feeling pain would be a good thing  her organ  this is where I need help from somebody  her organs  don't know when to  cool down or something like that  so if she doesn't keep her body temperature around 62 degrees constantly  whoa  her organs could actually just fry  overheat  and kill her  so they have to keep the house 
[01:56:30]  the whole family has to be cold  oh what a burden  that's what I'm saying man  this is why I was affected  I'm like this sucks  the house has to be at 62 degrees constantly  that's not good enough for her  she has a vest  where they put ice packs in it  so she walks around the house  with this vest with ice pack  to keep her body temperature  I'm not sure how cold the actual body has to be  but it has to be a lot colder  how much could you love the kid  I know her and her dumb hot organ  and then  the brother  feels so sorry for his sister 
[01:57:00]  that she can't really go outside  for a long time  a few minutes  kind of think bubble boy  a few minutes  and you've got to come back in  so the brother has decided  that he can't go outside and play  because she's inside  staring out the window  at him having a good time  it's like Edgar and Johnny Winter  walking around the house  so he's decided  that he will stay in with his sister  what a guy  so they built a house  because of the medical bills  they lost their house  they were pretty much homeless  and they built this state of the art house for her 
[01:57:30]  with just good air conditioning  oh there must be some air conditioning in there  they showed the  everybody freezing  it's like a meat locker  they showed the temp  it was 61 degrees  and they were all bundled up  and that's how they lived  and she goes to bed  with this stuffed animal  that they put in the freezer  they freeze up this stuffed animal  that she kind of goes to bed with  to keep herself  put her in the freezer  to keep herself cool  that's what I'm saying  just cut a hole  put her in there  like Arnold Schwarzenegger  from Batman 4  Mr. Freeze  I'm Mr. Freeze  Dix Bentley 
[01:58:00]  you know  I used to  I used to like  extreme home makeover  because you get some dumb family  they're down on their luck  a little bit  someone might have lost their job  maybe a little  maybe a little cancer  that they could cure  or whatever  but now it's like  they're going deep  into these diseases  you don't want to know about  well okay  you get to pick one  you get one disease  that bothers you  you can't be bothered  by any other one  just your disease  that bugs you  Patrice talking too much  we'll be back  Opie and Anthony  jeez  speed round here 
[01:58:30]  still lots to do  on the Opie and Anthony show  also maybe get a few rounds  of what did we learn  on the Opie and Anthony show today  I want to thank  Patrice O'Neal for coming in  patriceoneal.com  for all his  club dates  arena dates  Super Bowl dates  podcast  I don't know  podcast whatever  big game Opie  big game  don't say Super Bowl  or we'll get in trouble  you got to say  the big game  let's call it  the big overrated  corporate game  if they don't want us  to say the other word 
[01:59:00]  that's what we'll call it  dopes  a few other things  that everybody's talking about  well you're going to be  talking about this  a little later  they took a heart  from a dead rat  and they got it  to start beating again  that's creepy  yeah  that is really creepy  that's a bit creepy  they like grew it  didn't they  I think they  they took like cells  and grew  a heart  oh so this thing  was never alive  and it beats  yeah  they like grew one  they grew one 
[01:59:30]  and then got it  to start beating  that's pretty screwed up  yeah  why are rats the animal  all the time  I don't know  just start with people  their internal organs  kind of resemble others  somehow  and they respond  I think  similarly  somehow  humans and rats  are very similar  who are you kidding  it's true  more  they just destroy  everything around them  some more than others  so we got that going on  then we got two horses  I don't have the story  in front of me  but it happened  over the weekend  two horses  obviously a fan  of this very show  the horses are named 
[02:00:00]  Opie and Anthony  and they're starving  to death  a horrible horse owner  yes  owners of surviving horses  in blah blah county  try to nurture animals  back to health  many viewers were shocked  and outraged  last night  by our report  so this  this actual audio  this  we got to find  this news report  about horses  starved to death  they chose  never  rest  ranch  alright  whatever  whatever  police  and animal  protective league  say they found 
[02:00:30]  a total of  five dead horses  on the farm  they are considering  cruelty charges  against the owner  of the 20 horses  found alive  four have been  taken to foster homes  two named  Opie and Anthony  are at the  Guga County  Humane Shelter  there's two horses  named Opie  and Anthony  you guys lived  and yeah  they're alive  but in bad shape  they were on  some horse farm  where a bunch  of horses  were starved  I've heard  over the years  a fan 
[02:01:00]  calling a cat  Opie or Anthony  but never like a horse  I kind of remember  race horse though  like I think this guy  called in once  a long time ago  really  yeah and said  he was naming  his race horse  it was Opie and Anthony  well he didn't take care  of Opie and Anthony  it rings a bell  but yeah  this guy was a skank  I guess they were slow runners  so yeah  they were horrible  change the names  of Somalians  Ethiopians  I guess they're  I think he's claiming  that they're actually  on a hunger strike  swing and a miss  yeah  also I ran right 
[02:01:30]  into the wall  and felt nothing  well  speaking of that girl  thanks for the  the setup there Jimmy  talking about that girl  on extreme home makeover  last night  that doesn't feel pain  and she's got to keep  her organs cool  because they don't  the organs don't know  to not overheat  her name is  Kayla Woodhouse  and she lacks  the ability  to regulate temperature  cooling functions  sweating  don't kick in  until her body  reaches a lethal  high temperature  her skin is 
[02:02:00]  overly dry  you want to know  more about her  I can't wait  she wears a special  vest is the one  I was telling you  about with cold  packs in it  she can only go  outside to play  after sundown  the house  thermostat must stay  between 62 degrees  or below 62 degrees  let's see  what else  she was diagnosed  at 14 months old  after passing out  on a rare trip  to a playground  her mom said  the reason it took  that long  was a godsend  let's see  to save Kayla  they first moved  the family  which includes  Josh  to Alaska 
[02:02:30]  because it's cold  but it turned out  she was a racist  and hated Eskimos  so  this is what  the family had to do  to save this girl  they moved to Alaska  that didn't work out  too well  the biggest worry  was Kayla running  outside  at 15 below  without shoes  but the state  also proved  too far  from medical centers  a year ago  the family moved  to Colorado Springs  for the mild climate  what else do we know  about her  swimming is her only sport  and it's good 
[02:03:00]  to keep her body  it's good to keep  her body temperature  in check  but she's limited  to private indoor pools  she has horrible  allergies too  by the way  of course she does  church is the only time  she's around other kids  they still believe  in God  they still believe  in God  why would you  go to church  I know Christ  is all up there  with no shirt  showing off  she's gonna wear  a stupid ice vest  and a dopey hat  with two cold beer cans  in it  stupid  old cold shoes 
[02:03:30]  she has to wear  those cold pack shoes  I don't ride  with enough of this kid  I understand you're not  supposed to make someone  make fun of someone  else's faith  but that's where  I draw the line  I'm like  it's no God  it's no God  if you're allowing  this to happen  this crap  put some lotion on  it's dry skin  just have a living  one of those things  you shake up  snow globe  just put her in a giant  snow globe  I'm sure she shook  her dumb shaky  little  I lost  oh boy  you wanna know  more about her 
[02:04:00]  I can't wait  alright Kayla likes  to cook and sew  even these can be hazardous  she'll start to reach  into the oven  without a mitt  her mom said  that's just stupidity  I feel it  that's stupidity  that should be an easy one  to tell her  look you can't reach in  while the cookies  are baking  everything she eats  should have sickles  at the end  a frozen pot roast  so you can hit her  with it when she tries  to reach for it  too early  that's a roast sickle 
[02:04:30]  her first  sickle line  sorry  piled on  her first sewing  lesson a few years  ago was a disaster  Kayla sliced her  stomach with scissors  and didn't realize it  until blood was  spilling everywhere  she doesn't feel  pain until it's  20 to 30 times  the normal intensity  she was a fearless  toddler  she chomped on  Christmas lights  she slammed into  walls  she feels no pain  and is completely 
[02:05:00]  stupid  dude I was just  gonna say that  but she didn't seem  stupid last night  on the show  she's now about  11 or 12 I believe  I didn't eat Christmas  lights when I was a  boy  huh  I didn't eat them  no  did you  think of it  think of the  you know  she's getting older  when she gets  legal age  think of what  you can do  without any  her feeling  any pain  does she feel  you know  pleasure  you know  I don't know  who cares  how could you 
[02:05:30]  though  in 60 degree  room  you get a  cold shower  the air conditioning  has to stay on  year round  can you imagine  that Bill  and then  let's see what  else she does  oh she  they have to  duct tape  socks to her  hands so she  doesn't scratch  too hard  because she's got  such dry skin  she digs at the  sores in her  sleep  how about gloves  why socks on the  hand  because they're  poor  because they're  poor on top  of it  how horrific  is that  kids awful  am I not  carrying around  in one of  those puppy 
[02:06:00]  cases where  her head  sticks out  why even  try  let's go to  Joe in  Kansas  Joe  yes  I learned  today that  there is no  crying in  football so  hand Tio a  tissue  alright thank  you Joe  way to  follow it up  and finish  T-E-E-S-H  H-U  let's go to  Tom on  T-E-S-H-U  God damn  Tom  Long Island

[02:11:30]  a question  now  sodomy  legally  is not  necessarily  just  say flesh  on flesh  it can  be  something  an object  it's something  out of the  ordinary  of regular  you know  basic sex  like the  bible  the bible  is different  the sodomy  laws are like  if you use  something else  so was that  like an anger  thing  that wasn't  a sexual  crime  that was  like an  object  or something  let's  see here  father  sodomized 
[02:12:00]  his 18  year old  stepson  to avenge  the teenager's  alleged rape  of the man's  8 year old  daughter  wow  the father  32  turned himself  into authorities  on Friday  and was released  from jail  Saturday  he posted  $17,500  he faces a charge  of aggravated  sexual assault  this is a tough  one man  in so many ways  stepson was  arrested  January 2nd  charged with  suspicion of  aggravated  sexual assault  police say  the father  caught him  assaulting his  daughter  and a subsequent  examination  at a hospital  revealed the girl  had been  sodomized  this is a very 
[02:12:30]  unique case  no S  Sherlock  when the  stepson was  arrested  the man  warned his  wife not  to get the  teenager out  of jail  she posted  bond for  the teen's  release  so they  caught the  teenager  and he was  in jail  and the mom  was able to  get him out  when he called  home January  3rd after  getting released  the father  took the call  and picked  him up  police said  so wow  he's getting  released from  jail he calls  home the father  goes and gets  him  wow  instead of  taking the  teenager home  the Arlington  man drove to 
[02:13:00]  an abandoned  house in  Fort Worth  how do you know  where an abandoned  house is  what's up with  that  that's pretty  funny  no think  about it  yeah yeah  I mean we  all have  houses in our  neighborhoods  how do you  know which  ones are  abandoned  that's a  little creepy  screams coming  out of them  apparently  thank you  he beat his  stepson in the  abandoned home  with a baseball  bat and sodomized  him with a metal  tool  okay see that's  not a sexual  good for him  good for the  father  after the man 
[02:13:30]  left a stepson  found a payphone  and called police  who searched the  abandoned home  we did find  evidence at the  scene to  corroborate our  victim's story  wait let me ask  you a question  was it the  kid's father  or was it his  stepfather  stepfather  the father of  the girl  yeah  so the father  and the  like the kid  had the mother  and the separate  father  yeah  oh I see  okay  what a crazy  story  if he did  he should have  just killed  his stepfather  yeah  I never had  the right answer  so what do you  think happens  the father's 
[02:14:00]  gotta go to jail  now  nah he won't  go to jail  you don't think  so  that's a rough  extenuating  circumstance  premeditated  though  he picked  him up  it's not  like he walked  in it  he'd have  walked in on  him and did  it  but he picked  him up  plop it out  brought him to  an abandoned  home  yeah  we didn't get  to shoulder  surfing  we'll try to  do that  tomorrow  daddy by  queen  ifreka  some jamaican  song that's a  little crazy  we didn't get  to that today  and we didn't  get to  this sound  right here  maybe this  will tease  tomorrow show  let's see

[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Very healthy, very big roses.  A dozen red roses?  They're vibrant.  Yes.  I'll take it back.  Count them, Jimmy.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, four, oh my God, more.  And a few of them are closed, actually.  They must have just opened on the way over.  And I think they have been here for a while.  And I think they have been here for a while.  Right.  That's what he said.  I take it back because they've been here.  Yeah, yeah.  They've been here.  Let me see it again.  16 roses.  16 roses.  A couple of these babies are actually closed up. 
[02:19:30]  With some baby's breath.  16 roses.  That is a huge bouquet.  That one in the middle is a nice looking rose, dude.  There are some nice roses.  They're all very nice.  And some baby's breath.  They look good.  Very nice.  And I assume this particular company is going to start advertising on the show.  Yes.  Over here at XM Satellite Radio.  Yes.  I'd love to hear these two again.  They are.  So I don't think we'll mention the name.  FTD.  All right.  Fuck them.  They smell good.  They've made a mistake.  They're wonderful roses. 
[02:20:00]  That's what I said.  I said, we're going to tell you what's good about this and what's bad about this.  The roses are very, very nice.  Look, you can't just pull the pedal off.  You've got to struggle a little bit to get the pedal off.  Very healthy.  What are you doing?  Here's the problem.  I'm just getting it right.  Oh.  You fixing it up?  Yeah.  That's what I want to do.  What else?  The flower stand, you kind of pinch them and you fix it up a little.  I see it.  Now it looks good.  She loves me.  She loves me not.  You want to play?  Oh, wow.  Well, Jimmy.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Well, there goes one rose. 
[02:20:30]  Well, here's the problem I have with the fact that they sent at least 16 beautiful roses.  I mean, really, beautiful.  They cut the thorns?  They sent the flowers to, well, from FTD to Opie.  No.  And?  No?  No.  Dear Greg and Anthony.  Oh, wow.  From the entire FTD family, thank you for your support in working with us. 
[02:21:00]  We hope you enjoy these roses.  Greg and Anthony.  How the fuck, FTD?  And we do like you, because the roses are beautiful.  Yes.  How the fuck are we supposed to share a bouquet of flowers?  I know.  Between Greg and Tony?  Wouldn't you think we'd like to take them home and display them for friends and family  and not just have them sit here at the radio station where they won't be taken care of,  they won't be put in a vase, they'll just rot?  How are we supposed to enjoy? 
[02:21:30]  Like, I get them, like, on odd days and Anthony gets them on even days?  Yeah, we have a shared custody of the roses.  Gregodio wants his own bouquet of flowers.  So does Antonio.  People think you guys live together and sleep in the same room like Ricky and Lucy.  Yeah.  Like, with separate single king, like, single day.  That's a Dick Van Dyke couch.  I thought it was going to be like the Beatles in Hard Day's Night.  Like, everyone thought the Beatles always were hanging out together.  Oh, I thought a Hard Day's Night was one slumped over in front of the Dakota, 
[02:22:00]  hanging out, sneezing with a squishy sound.  Anthony's...  Same joke from last month.  Anthony's had his house for almost two years.  I've never seen it.  I don't think I'll see it any time soon.  I've never seen yours.  You've never been over there?  I haven't.  It's not ready for...  I've been to Anthony's.  Yours?  They're working on it, yeah.  You have a lot of people coming over your house.  That's probably why y'all's last along good...  You know, it's probably best not to...  I just have...  I didn't have people over as, like, guests like that.  I had people over playing poker.  So I have a poker table and chairs in the, like, dining kind of area off the kitchen. 
[02:22:30]  It's not like a, let me have people over kind of a thing.  It's just, bring some beer.  I'm not a have people over type of guy, though.  What, I'm supposed to sit there and have tea and fucking biscuits with you?  Crumpets.  I love show business, friends.  I just love the new way I've learned how to throw the word friendship around.  Yeah.  And it not mean a fucking thing.  Me and Norton call ourselves great friends.  I talk to Norton every eclipse. 
[02:23:00]  Me and you are good friends.  Patrice is a bad friend because he didn't invite me to Fourth of July.  I was actually hurt somewhere to win.  But we're good friends because we talk about a lot of very intimate things.  We're not surface friends.  Surface friends...  I don't want to call it surface friends.  You, Keith, Bobby, I consider my friends.  But we just, I think show business, you use it way different than squares, though.  Like, you don't go...  It took a minute for Gavin to understand that we don't talk every three days. 
[02:23:30]  You talk to your friends every three days or he'll go, what's wrong, man?  Yeah.  It's like, I can talk to Norton.  Like he said, when I did the Def Jam thing, the first correspondence that Norton tried to  have with me in the last six years was to text me and say he hates my hat.  But over the time period, there is no missing.  Like, if I didn't see you guys for five months, I wouldn't come back and go, what the...  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:24:00]  It's like Groundhog Day and you just...  Time freezes.  You take up where you left off.  The difference is, like, Patrice will be in Texas and I'll be in Los Angeles.  Yeah.  And then we're back at the cellar on Sunday and I don't see him for three months because  he's on the road.  That literally is the way it is.  You guys are so self-absorbed.  It's not about that.  It's a place by traveling.  You don't really give a shit about each other.  That's not true.  But you guys don't...  You do a show every...  You do a show every day together.  Right.  And never been in his house, never been in his new house.  Don't really...  You go, hey, let's go to this thing tomorrow. 
[02:24:30]  Nope.  You're there.  You're a Long Island dude.  You're a city dude.  Yeah, it's just logistics with me.  I would go, but I ain't gonna hang out in the city and deal with fucking...  But Square Friends don't have logistics.  ...three hours of traffic getting home and I could be home in 20 minutes.  There you go, Square Friends do that, though.  Because their schedules are a lot of times the same every day.  There would be times like that, like New Year's Eve was a blast.  Going down to FH Riley's.  Like, hanging out.  We didn't hang out.  What?  We didn't hang out. 
[02:25:00]  We were at the same table.  We didn't even talk.  We did.  Are you crazy?  We were in the same restaurant.  I'm not saying it in the bad way.  I know.  I waved to you at when the clock struck 12.  You made it sound like we were hanging and clinking beers and stuff.  We don't hate each other, but we don't really...  We did.  We don't really...  I'm not saying it in the bad way.  I said I thought we clinked glasses.  No!  You were at one end of the table.  I was at the other end.  Jimmy was in between us.  I was like, where's...  Entertainment.  I was like, where'd Anthony go? 
[02:25:30]  You were gone.  But I think you were a little buzzed.  I think this was life.  We had...  Yeah.  We had a nice interaction.  I think that's the great thing about this business.  It teaches you solitary confinement.  It teaches you just how to be alone and have tons of friends and still be lonely.  Wait, you really thought we hung out?  That's so weird to me.  We were at the same table, and I do recall we were talking at some point about something.  We barely talked.  But I'll guarantee...  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just saying we barely talked.  I'll guarantee you my interactions with... 
[02:26:00]  We were both very busy.  Like, I was hanging with my girl and my brothers and stuff.  Trying to get a couple to shut the fuck up.  And you were doing your thing.  That's all.  Jesus, it wouldn't stop.  You remember them yapping, fam?  I thought you knew them.  No, I didn't know them.  There were fans that just came up and wouldn't shut up.  Trying to eat for the fuck's sake.  I was this close to leaning in and being like, this guy actually thinks he's part of the group.  And then I was like, wait, he's so comfortable, he has to be part of the group.  He was not.  He was part of the group as far as the bill went. 
[02:26:30]  He got a nice free meal and free drinks all night long.  I thought it was Harry and Betty Cumia.  Who are these people?  I mean, Betty.  I guess he was smart enough to figure it out.  But Patrice, here's the thing.  Patrice, I know you better than I know a lot of quote-unquote square friends.  I'm more intimate with guys like him and Bobby and Keith and Colin than I am with people  that I wouldn't ever know outside the business.  I'm more myself and more honest with these guys than anybody.  It's a different...  Plus, I get excited to see Norton when I don't see him. 
[02:27:00]  It's just a different thing.  Bobby will call me every three months.  Yeah.  And that's another thing, too, about the business is that you know how to be friends with people.  Like, you know what context.  Everybody's in a context.  Uh-huh.  And you know how to be friends with them.  Like, you know how to be friends with Norton.  In that context.  You know Norton.  You have to talk to him in five-minute intervals.  And then he has to go and do something on the computer. 
[02:27:30]  No, no, no.  Hey, Norton, how are you?  Goodbye.  I'm fucking looking at somethingsomething.com.  Really?  Here's shittiest get-off-the-phone fucking person ever.  Ever.  Okay?  Patrice is the fucking worst because you'll be talking about it.  And then he's just done with you and you know it.  And here's how you know.  You at the cellar tonight?  Just fucking hang up on me.  We know where this is going.  You don't care if I'm at the cellar.  It is all the same. 
[02:28:00]  You're just trying to get off.  You don't want to overstay your welcome with this horse shit.  Getting back to the flowers, though.  Which, by the way, Stephen S. from Bayshore writes,  Hey, Ope, you should split those roses between Jimmy, his girl, and Tom Chiasano.  Oh, well, the three.  But this is the problem I have with the FTD thing.  It was nice that they sent the roses, but how the fuck are Ant and I supposed to split  a bouquet of roses?  Eight a piece.  It's just dumb. 
[02:28:30]  How?  And then what?  Put them in my pocket?  It's too much work.  Hold them like fucking Chubsy-Ubsy going to fucking Miss Crabtree.  Chubsy-Ubsy.  In my hand.  I would have brought home a nice bouquet of flowers from FTD and displayed them.  It would have been nice.  Who's more likely to give his girl flowers?  You or you?  I don't know anything about him.  My, uh...  I would say Ope because Ant and his girl are together for a lot longer.  Jesus.  I would say because you have a...  She don't really like flowers.  She don't like getting flowers. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, I don't see her.  I would say...  It's very easy.  Ope, he gets the flowers.  And I don't think you would mind.  Well, listen.  But Anthony might want them in his home, though.  No, he doesn't want them in his home.  You don't want flowers in your home?  Do you want flowers, sweetie?  I'll buy you some.  Do you want flowers?  But what?  He looks hurt.  He wants flowers.  No, he doesn't.  I know what...  No, I know Ant, and he knows me.  Now, neither one of us can take these home.  It's too creepy.  Yeah, it is creepy.  How about this?  So someone else gets them.  Why don't you do this?  They'll send more.  They should have sent two.  Of course they should have.  They're just...  If I send flowers...  Hold on, the Islanders... 
[02:29:30]  I fucking send flowers.  I ain't gonna give free flowers away.  They would have just gone to my house and hung out and kind of like fucking, you know,  lightened up a room.  But I'm not gonna present them like fucking, uh...  Oh, no, you gotta...  If you bring free flowers home, you gotta, like, start by going, look.  Free flowers from FTD.  I don't want you to think that I just all of a sudden just brought flowers.  That's creepy.  But let's enjoy them anyway.  They're nice.  They're, you know, it was a nice gesture.  Like fucking Bradley when he got the stereo salesman's flowers from fucking his whore 
[02:30:00]  sister in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and gave it to his girlfriend.  Right, right.  Like he got them.  Are you a plastic tree guy?  What, for Christmas?  No.  A plastic, uh...  No, no, no.  Just tree.  Real plants.  Yeah, you're a real plant guy?  Yeah, real plants.  Are you a plastic tree guy?  No, I'm...  Whatever.  I got a real Christmas tree.  That's all I have.  No, I'm just saying in terms of...  You live in an apartment.  What am I supposed to have?  Yeah, no, I don't like that shit.  Plastic furs?  What is it?  After a while, it's just a dusty...  I don't know what I'm just asking. 
[02:30:30]  Your questions suck sometimes.  Trying to get all in depth like this is inside the actor's studio.  Shut up.  Who gets the flowers?  Neither one of us.  No one will get them now.  Someone will just have to fucking take them.  It was a dumb gesture by this company.  You should have sent two.  Stupid.  Should have sent two.  I got interrupted, but the Islanders sent us both.  They didn't send one jersey for us to share or squeeze into it together.  I got an Islander jersey.  Anthony's not a hockey fan, so he got one too, but he's...  Whatever, but... 
[02:31:00]  He threw it on the floor.  Could you kick the flowers over?  It'll make me very happy.  No.  We should give them to somebody who's like...  Is it in a vase?  Can you open the whole thing?  A vase.  Open the whole thing.  Hold on.  Give me the flowers.  Seriously.  I want to...  No, nothing bad.  We should give them to...  I want to decide who on staff gets these flowers.  Open it up and look at if it's in a vase, vase, whatever.  Who's in love?  You know what?  I think E-Rock...  Travis is in love.  E-Rock is in love.  I think E-Rock really loves this girl.  You know, I think all the abuse that E-Rock has gotten over the years...  E-Rock?  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Would your girl love these?  Knowing that...  No, but he's going to give it to a chicken.  No.  He's going to give it to a cutlet.  Wouldn't she love those?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  She would...  Ange would love these, right?  She would definitely love them.  They're beautiful.  You would take them home and display them nice?  Is there a glass vase in there?  Huh?  Is there a glass vase in there?  What's at the bottom?  Styrofoam.  I want to see if there's like...  Styrofoam.  If it's just stuck in styrofoam or if there's a vase.  You got a scissor so we can open styrofoam.  Give me a scissor. 
[02:32:00]  Styrofoam.  You can just roll them up in newspaper like Luca Brasi's vest.  They're very nice.  They got like white little...  Ant's not going to take them home.  I'm not taking them home.  Maybe he's breath or something.  You've taken a lot of abuse lately.  Let me...  Ferns.  Look at that.  He rocks an awful head.  Looks like a Trojan horse.  We can't...  Patrice.  Oh, fuck.  Goddamn, is that funny? 
[02:32:30]  Trojan horse.  It does.  His head's making me sick.  It's just weird.  It's his real hair but it looks like a hair piece.  I can't get over it.  It's just bothering me.  Oh, Patrice.  That is it.  A Trojan fucking horse.  There is no way to style this that would be acceptable to anybody.  Sure.  12 gauge.  How about the Kennedy swoop?  You brush it back with a 9mm.  And you gently part your brain stem. 
[02:33:00]  I'm sorry.  Do we have a scissor?  I'm trying to get to the bottom of this thing.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Well, the scissor or something.  Jesus Christ.  I hope we get a scissor.  It really is.  That's...  Puffy.  But why, you know, it's like sin too for the love of God.  That way we can take them home.  And people go, oh, those are nice roses.  And you go, yes, you know, FTD sent them.  Oh, great.  They send one.  Am I going to wreck this if I do the package?  No, you want them to die. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, it's a nice vase.  Oh, is it?  Okay.  I thought so.  Cool.  E-Rock, you want these?  Sure.  I'll take them.  Oh, no.  There he is.  He's cutting off all the fucking tops.  Is that just making them easier to carry?  Yeah.  That's...  You missed one.  That's how Morticia Adams used to do her gardening.  There you go.  That's good.  There's your flowers.  Now put them inside your head and sneak them in the house. 
[02:34:00]  They do smell nice.  It says do smell nice, don't they?  They're beautiful, but next time send two, please.  Exactly.  Fucking this boy's life hair.  Here, you could have put these in your teeth or something.  There you go.  Buy your own flowers if you want to bring flowers home to your girl.  Exactly, you leech. 
[02:34:30]  Roses look like vaginas if you squish them.  It's true.  Without the annoying fucking nothing wrapped around it.  Fucking all emasculating whores.  Are you going to get through this situation with your girl?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because you're sounding a little grim about the whole thing of you're not quite...  Oh, missing each other?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, you're just missing and...  I'd love to blame her for the whole thing, but it's almost like I can't be such a loon  that I think it's completely her fault.  It can't be. 
[02:35:00]  Are you...  Because any time we've seen you two together, you are the picture-perfect couple.  Yeah, we're silly together.  I'm thinking, is it...  Are you just trying to not make a scene?  No.  Or at those times, you're genuinely having a good time?  Oh, yeah.  So why...  How come every time we see you, you're genuinely having a good time?  I don't know what happens to us.  We hit each other on a really personal level.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know if it's because we have the same flaws or whatever, man, but she can 
[02:35:30]  get to me like nobody else alive.  Wow.  And I can get to her the same way.  That's dangerous.  Yeah, man.  Because that's when you delve into that area where there's no taking shit back.  We've never said anything like that.  Not yet.  Oh, you're bound...  You're heading for it.  Full steam ahead.  Choo-choo.  Full steam ahead on the, you're a cunt express.  That's take-backable.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What isn't take-backable?  And not be specific.  Anything personal, I'd say, about family, that was told... 
[02:36:00]  Anything that's truly intimate.  Like, anything that can only be used against you, or that I know is going to hurt you, whatever  that is.  Yeah, okay.  You know what I mean?  It's like, and you both know when you're doing it.  Yeah.  Where it's just vicious.  If a girl, like, you argue with a girl and she spits out and so-and-so is a better fuck.  That would be like...  A-true, I'm sure.  Believe me, being a better fuck than me is no great shakes.  It's like being the fucking smartest in the three stooges. 
[02:36:30]  Mediocre at best, but fucking, that's untake-backable.  That's untake-backable.  I'm sure it is, because you'd never...  I'd think of nothing else when I looked at her.  Right.  Unless she said it in bed while we were having sex, that I'd cum immediately.  I'd cum, I'd cum, like, the way you snipped roses, like somebody snipped to keep the  cum-in valve.  I would fucking...  I would cum so hard, her asshole would have cum.  I literally would bust a nut immediately.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  That would turn me out like a light.  All right, moving on to...  She said, I need a bigger cock to fuck me. 
[02:37:00]  I would just, before she finished, I would go, urgh.  I would just collapse and...  I wouldn't even buck.  I would just collapse on her and just cum as I fell asleep.  I cum would leak out of me like a rain gutter.  None of that fucking thrusting shit.  All right, we got a fine little story here.  Oh, God.  Some hidden camera shit.  A father finds a surveillance camera in a bathroom. 
[02:37:30]  He and his family had been staying at the Santa Fe Skis RV Park for three days before  discovering the wireless camera.  Now he has a lot of questions.  Now, while in the bathroom earlier today, Kimball Kubiak looked up into a skylight and  saw a hidden camera pointing down.  He immediately called deputies.  Then he called us.  Enter the men's bathroom of the Santa Fe Skis RV Park.  To the right, the showers, to the left, stalls and urinals, and up above, perched inside  a skylight, a wireless camera.  It's an invasion of privacy. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, totally.  I mean, I don't...  My son, my 13-year-old son's been in there.  You know, we've both been in there.  Thank you so much.  Oh, relax.  Just let the guy look at your son's dick.  Exactly.  At least the guy's out there doing it.  The guy's trying to jerk off from home.  Gives a shit.  Watching it at home.  Take a look if you want.  Whatever.  You and young Dirk Diggler.  What am I supposed to do?  What am I supposed to, like, go take his dick?  Fucking Tattletail.  What am I supposed to do?  Take a Brillo shower because you want to look at my dick? 
[02:38:30]  Gives a shit.  Exactly.  Here you go, buddy.  Take a peek.  Whatever floats your boat.  Don't touch it.  Kimball Kubiak discovered the camera this morning after staying at the RV park with his  family for three days.  You don't know if our little boy's been filmed or what.  Or if I've been filmed.  I mean, it's...  You both have idiots.  What's going to happen if you were filmed?  How small is your dick that you're worried about this, sir?  I'll end up on the internet.  And why are you looking up at the skylight when you're supposed to be pissing, you fucking  creep?  I don't want everyone to know that I got one giant ball. 
[02:39:00]  I did a lot of covert, not showing my dick stuff in my life.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, my God.  What do you mean, not showing your dick?  Just like in football practice.  I'd go home in my entire football uniform.  Running down the block.  I'd be on the bus in my cleats.  And my shoulder pads, making sure nobody saw my non-swinging dick.  Oh, man.  I was the same way.  I was paranoid to take those fucking team showers, man.  Fuck that. 
[02:39:30]  I'll be sweaty for the last three periods.  That's okay.  Ain't you going to take a shower?  No.  I don't need to smell good for fucking math class.  I don't need to smell that good.  Everybody on the team buses in tuxedos.  I got my uniform still on.  The mature guys with their big cocks.  Was that your problem?  I just didn't have a swinger.  It filled up, but it just didn't do nothing.  Yes, E-Rock's got a little something on the flowers, yes.  Did we lose a client? 
[02:40:00]  No, but XM just contacted us.  They are a client, and there's supposedly two more shipments of roses coming.  For another Greg and Tony?  There's supposed to be one for you, for Anthony, and for Jim.  So there's two more on the tour.  All right, well, because I was the asshole, I don't get flowers now.  Oh, dude, you guys take it.  What am I going to do?  I don't get flowers.  I don't get flowers.  Who am I going to give them to?  Give me a girl.  And I didn't trash the face he makes at me.  I didn't trash the client. 
[02:40:30]  Did you just hear what I was saying?  I said the roses were great.  Yeah, they are.  The roses are beautiful.  It didn't seem smart to send them to Greg and Anthony.  We can't share them.  We're not fucking gay lovers yet.  All right, more on the paranoid RV guy, worried that someone might have saw his cock.  What a snitch.  It was a camera.  Yeah, but who gives a shit?  You're taking a leak.  Someone fucking takes a shot at you.  Who cares? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know if I'd like that.  If you're looking good, I wouldn't care.  I don't give a shit.  As long as the guy's not coming on to me or trying to touch me or anything, I don't...  Who cares?  It's just, you should not have a camera in any restroom.  If there's one visible, who knows if there's anything hidden?  I mean...  Oh, man on the street stuff.  Good.  Yeah, you should not have a camera in the restroom.  In any restroom.  Really?  I read that somewhere when I was reading.  I'm all for a four-camera shoot.  Absolutely.  What do you think of that?  I want a ball cam from the floor up front. 
[02:41:30]  I want a...  What is it?  What are they called?  Best grips or best...  Best boy.  Best boy.  I want a best boy.  Yeah, there's a fucking boom operator behind the guy holding a mic over him.  That's what I want.  Well, listen to the man on the street adding a lot, a lot to the interview.  Or if I've been filmed.  I mean, it's just, you should not have a camera in any restroom.  If there's one visible, who knows if there's anything hidden?  I mean, I just, I don't trust, you know, just somebody telling me, no, there's nothing 
[02:42:00]  else there.  The Cooper Ys called the sheriff's department to investigate and took some video of their  own, and the RV park called a city police officer who they say they've talked to before.  They said they spoke to a city police officer who told them that it was, it was okay if  they put a camera in there.  Hmm.  No.  Can't be okay to put a camera in there.  Unless they weren't filming people pissed, they were filming, uh, loitering activity.  I wonder if that's the thing.  Like, it was illegally put in. 
[02:42:30]  Or filming all, you know, little shenanigans.  Yeah, they're just trying to catch guys popping cocks in each other's mouths.  Like Tic Tacs.  Exactly.  Just holding it under the tongue like nitroglycerin.  Jesus.  A little clear stuff into the system.  Park manager says it was to catch vandalism.  What the fuck?  He's worried about his toilet paper?  No.  And it's like soap?  One guy was wrecking another guy's asshole. 
[02:43:00]  That crazy vandal writing in graffiti on the guy's back with a load.  Wash me with fucking common blood.  Spelling west side.  Spelling MS-13 and fucking cock juice on your neck.  And cum blood and shit.  Crazy vandalism.  Crazy vandalism.  Sheriff Greg Solano tells us park managers admitted to putting up the camera, but say it was to catch people breaking into a cleaning cabinet underneath the sink. 
[02:43:30]  According to the owners, they were having vandalism and theft.  In those cabinets is where they keep bathroom supplies, toilet paper.  So put the camera in the fucking cabinet.  It doesn't look like a kitchen boyery.  Asshole does someone opens it.  You hit their face.  Right.  Yeah, really.  You guys got a sky cam.  We were trying to get the Hubble aimed at this fucking rest park.  Yeah.  I'd like to see what they're stealing if that 13-year-old's cock wasn't in the way.  What are you taking?  Toilet paper?  What's in a fucking RV rest toilet?  Yeah.  Toilet.  Instead, they got a telescope in the toilet trying to catch vandalism. 
[02:44:00]  Supplies, toilet paper.  Solano says so far it doesn't look like intentional voyeurism.  I think the city officer misadvised them on this case, and we've told them that they need to take it down, and they said they would immediately.  You walk nude all in there, whether it's at the sink or not.  So it shouldn't matter whether it's at the sink or where it's pointed.  There's still a camera in the restroom.  Okay, he's not letting go.  Yeah, he's obsessed.  Mike from New York. 
[02:44:30]  Mike?  Mike from New York.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  Mike?  If I can't get four ounces of sausage in a package, my God, I'm going to film it in this RV park.  It sounds similar, right?  The sausage guy.  The sausage.  Sausage.  I don't want my son's sausage.  Sausage.  Videotapes.  A 16-ounce package.  Package.  Package.  Package.  Sausage.  I hope he bit into a sausage and there was fucking glass in it. 
[02:45:00]  All right, so that's going on.  Whatever.  Cute story.  Hey, quick break, but before we go to break, we want to remind people.  Actually, I don't think we started promoting this, right?  We start today.  Couples Cherry Darts.  Coming soon to the opening.  Ah!  With a twist.  With a twist.  We got a date set and everything.  Oh, wow.  I'm not saying anything.  I wouldn't say a word.  What?  About the twist.  What's the twist?  It's only gay couples.  There's a twist to this?  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  The grenade launcher?  You know?  Yeah.  Like, you get ready and it's like, not, not, not, not.  They're really cherry bombs.  Eh.  And then, and then, and then, uh, you know, guys, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, wham.  That's right.  How's that?  Very good.  By the way, no wonder no one laughed at my joke.  It's a periscope, not a telescope.  Fucking dope I am.  Oh, out of the toilet.  Uh, couples.  See, now it'd be funny. 
[02:46:00]  What an idiot.  Now it's interesting.  Now it's almost funny.  Fucking telescope.  Submarine is in the toilet.  A telescope in a toilet bowl.  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, uh.  No worse than my fucking cherry bombs joke.  Which just fucking went through the fucking.  You missed that one?  I did.  Oh, boy.  Apparently everyone in the studio and the home audience did as well.  It was a monumental dud.  Fired out.  It was a verbal clunker.  It was a fucking, it was, it was a verbal jalopy. 
[02:46:30]  The Edsel of jokes.  It was fucking the Windows Vista of improvs.  Fucking, oh, it was awful.  Jalopy.  It ran right into a wall and bounced off like a fucking hot-livered little fucking creepy  kid.  Old, old, old toaster guts.  I've had enough of fucking old oven guts.  Oh, McDonald's cherry pie filling guts. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, I've had enough of that stupid kid in her 20 times the pain.  She doesn't know she's not supposed to fucking eat Christmas bulbs.  Yeah, then fucking kick her out.  Oh, God.  Kick her into the hot sauce.  What, is she going to get married and have a fucking real family?  Fucking burden.  Yeah, who's going to fuck her?  You have to put a little warmer on your dick.  Put a dick glove on so it stays hard at 50 degrees.  Fucking creepy Mr. Freeze bitch. 
[02:47:30]  Kid sucks.  Fucking get a frozen coat hanger and fix that.  What a bad girl.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Fucking.  You got to fuck her with popsicles.  Old, old, old lava cervix.  Oh, my God. 
[02:48:00]  I'm fucked up.  Oh, old Sahara pussy.  Nobody wants that.  No one needs that.  Nobody wants that, a hot pussy.  Fucking radiator ass.  I would like to understand, because last night I had teary eyeballs.  Today, I think it's the funniest thing in the world.  It's hilarious.  Whatever.  Bouncing off walls.  What a dopey kid.  By the way, getting back to the RV hidden camera story, someone suggests on instant feedback,  Dan C. from Pottstown, PA, wouldn't a lock work?  Yeah, how about locking it up? 
[02:48:30]  No, it wouldn't work, because then you couldn't see people in the bathroom.  Or how about just a sign, camera installed, even if there wasn't one.  The guy thought it out, though.  He's like, okay, if by chance I get caught, I could always say it's because I got supplies  in this cabinet.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, a lock would work.  But like Ant just said, then he wouldn't get to see a young cock.  Maybe it's a rotating camera that he can aim wherever he wants, so at the end of the  night, right back towards the camera, towards the cabinet.  The cabinet, in case they find it.  Very good.  Who knows?  All right, Cherry Darts. 
[02:49:00]  It's happening on January 31st.  That's a Thursday.  It's already penciled in and ready to go on our schedule.  Cherry Darts is fun.  We want to thank Bodoglife.net.  They have supplied $2,500.  Bodoglife.net.  Righteous bucks.  And we'll split it up first and maybe second prize, so we'll figure that shit out behind  the scenes, but at least $1,000, well, way more than $1,000 cash to the winner of Cherry  Darts.  Basically, you come in here with your gal, talking to the guys, of course, or maybe we 
[02:49:30]  get a lesbo couple.  You never know.  Or a gay couple.  Let's be all inclusive.  Oh, God.  I would love that.  What?  Are you kidding me?  What?  What?  A gay guy lobbing a cherry at the asshole of another gay guy?  What?  Who wouldn't enjoy that?  What?  I would love it.  What?  I do think it would be advantageous to them.  The target's bigger.  Of course.  That's true.  We have to get them bowling balls painted red.  Let's get spit back out along with the stem tied in a knot. 
[02:50:00]  The bowling balls one went nowhere.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  No, it's okay.  I just accepted.  Bowling balls.  Painted red.  I thought that would be a fucking hit.  It is funny.  I actually slid into the room with my arms open.  I thought you'd go to different fruit.  Pomegranate darts.  Wind up like a softball.  Hit his catcher's mitt, asshole.  What about cannonball darts?  Just fucking...  So, the girls will be across the room, naked, bending over. 
[02:50:30]  We're guys.  Girls.  Okay.  And then their boyfriend, their husband, their...  Partner.  Life partner.  Girl lover.  Get darts.  Cherries.  Cherries.  With little whipped cream on them.  Ooh.  And they go for the bullseye, which is the anus.  Closest to the anus.  But I think we're going to make a whole dartboard on their butt side.  Oh, yeah.  That way we can have points.  And then we'll have a point system.  And then whoever wins...  Points.  Whoever gets the most points after, I don't know, 10 rounds or whatever, how many we feel 
[02:51:00]  like playing, that they're going to win a lot of money from bowdoglife.net.  So, if you're a couple and you're interested in doing this, you've got to email Travis  at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Okay?  Travis has Jim's bomb.  Oh, I've got to hear this now.  This is Jimmy from a mere two minutes ago.  Oh, wow.  Take shelter.  Couples' cherry darts coming soon to the OPS.  With a twist.  With a twist. 
[02:51:30]  We've got a date set and everything.  You're not saying anything.  I wouldn't say a word.  What?  About the twist.  What's the twist?  It's only gay couples.  There's a twist to this?  Yeah.  Bomb number one.  A grenade launcher?  You know?  Like, you get ready and it's like, not, not, not, not.  They're really cherry bombs.  And then, you know.  Oh, God. 
[02:52:00]  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, were you throwing them?  No, he wasn't.  He was doing that subliminally.  Yes.  The humor went right into the fucking mat.  I kind of whispered him in the background.  Well, I didn't want to, you know, just blur it out.  You see, I threw out little lines.  How could I have confidence?  Three in a row.  Strike one.  Strike two.  Strike three.  Strike one.  Strike two.  Strike three.  You're out.  John of Virginia is saying gay cherry darts equals Howard Stern bit.  Oh, all right.  Well, I don't listen to Stern.  That's bullshit.  We've been doing the cherry dart thing for years. 
[02:52:30]  Never heard of it, sir.  Yes, sir.  We do it with chicks.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm stealing from Howard on the air.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we're doing.  Yeah.  A couple's cherry darts happening January 31st.  Once again, $2,500 up for grabs.  Bodoglife.net.  Thank you.  Email Travis at foundrymusic.com if you want to participate.  Okay?  Right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous.  Goddamn ridiculous.  I need to be a shock doc. 
[02:53:00]  Always up to no good.  Be a man.  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is, like, the number one show in the world.  All right.  We're back.  You're right.  If you care.  You better. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, movies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, this makes me cold.  I decided to, uh, I know.  I'm going to have to put my jacket on.  I decided to go to the movies yesterday and, uh...  Oh, what'd you see?  And once again, I'm like, why do we have to go to fucking movie theaters to see movies in this day and age?  But whatever.  I finally saw, uh, No Country for Old Men.  Men.  Yeah.  No Country for Old Men, yeah.  It was all right. 
[02:54:00]  It was all right.  No one's seen it here, though, right?  Dan, you saw it.  Dan loved it, right?  I didn't see it.  A lot of people giving it raves.  I liked it a lot.  Sam is even more of a fan.  Why?  The ending bugged me, which, of course, we won't get into it.  But Sam thought it was brilliant.  He thought it was brilliant?  Yeah.  Sam's kind of an idiot.  He's a dummy.  He watches wrestling.  What the fuck does he know about quality?  I know.  Yeah.  It was a really good film by the Coen brothers, but, uh, I don't know.  They're saying it's like one of the best movies in a really, really long time and all 
[02:54:30]  that, right?  I'd give it three stars.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was good.  A lot of blood.  A lot of good violence.  Rotten Tomatoes?  Rotten Tomatoes?  What did Rotten Tomatoes give it?  Your three stars?  Something awesome.  Like 70 or 80, I bet.  80%, I'm going to guess.  On Rotten Tomatoes.  I say 71.  93.  93.  Nope.  93.  93.  Wow, Patrice.  I do know. 
[02:55:00]  How's that sandwich?  He just guessed.  He guessed and it was right.  It just was a well-loved movie.  Yeah.  Me and Patrice had a moment on the other side, by the way, that we just, I guess, both decided  not to bring on the radio and now I'm bringing it on the radio.  I'm such an asshole.  Well, Kenny gets everyone's food and he plunks down like so much watermelon in front of you,  all cut up nice.  And I looked at you and you looked at me like, yeah, I know, it's very stereotypical, but 
[02:55:30]  I just like watermelon.  Good shit.  I love watermelon.  We just had this weird moment, like, we both acknowledged how ridiculous it was.  I will not let, what's his name, D.W. Griffin movie stop me from fucking water.  I don't give a fuck how big the bug eyes was and fuck that.  I just enjoy watermelon and he can't help but look, because I understand, it's just like 
[02:56:00]  if you have an Asian friend that just does everything with chopsticks, right?  Like, I'm just going to, and you just go, what the fuck are you doing?  So I guess a black guy.  I never liked watermelon.  Hated it.  My entire life.  It's delicious, man.  Yeah.  And every time I try to bite it, I'm like, how is something so wet but tastes so dry at  the same time?  It's the best.  It's so stupid.  I wish I had enough balls to come in there and have Kenny bring me the whole one that  I could just chew down to the rind and eat it like a back and forth. 
[02:56:30]  Right, right.  Like in the cartoons.  Balls, you should see how I eat watermelon when no one's looking.  You need a bib, right?  Oh, my God.  How sharp did I have me killed?  That's the first on the agenda.  But it's sugar water, really.  I eat watermelon like the 20s.  Yeah, it's all fucking water.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  But then it tastes dry, though. 
[02:57:00]  Does it?  It's weird.  I love that shit.  Whatever.  I can eat one bite of watermelon and I get one of those fucking seeds in my mouth and  I want to just throw it out the window.  That's what I don't like.  Slimy seeds, too, on top of it.  Seeds piss me off in anything.  It was just a dumb, stupid moment that we both kind of acknowledged secretly to each other.  It didn't even say anything.  Anyway, on Rotten Tomatoes, again, 95%.  One movie got a zero.  A zero?  Miss Call, the remake. 
[02:57:30]  Because, you know, for some reason we get a...  That's a remake?  It's based on cell phone technology.  No.  There's no movie, no horror movie now, American, that's not copying the goddamn Japanese.  They're all Japanese movies.  Miss Call is a Japanese movie that was very scary.  Yeah.  This got zero.  Oh, wow.  I think it might be the only zero in history.  Well, Dan will look it up when he gets back in here.  It follows that whole theme of if you watch the videotape, you'd fucking die.  And if you do this, play a video game, you'd die.  And now it's a cell phone call. 
[02:58:00]  And if you get the cell phone call...  All Japanese.  And some idiot in Hollywood or wherever was like, look, man, everybody's using cell phones.  Why don't we try to get a movie where we scare the shit out of everybody that uses cell phones?  Didn't work.  Jessica Alba's movie.  What rating did that get?  The Eye.  Miss Call or whatever it's called.  The Eye, right?  Hey, uh...  Got shit.  You want to guess what the number one movie at the box office was?  Um...  Um...  Miss Call? 
[02:58:30]  National Treasure still?  That fucking National Treasure 2 did well again.  Fourth place.  What's the total on that fucker?  Another $11.4 million earned.  What's the total on that thing?  I'm starting to think I might have to see this dumb movie.  No.  How much money?  Look, there's movies that get hyped up and they do very well after the first week.  Then they die fast because people didn't enjoy the movie.  Oh, man just went...  Oh, man.  And they're not telling their friends.  But this National Treasure 2, week after week, is doing well, which means people are liking it.  But you know what, John?  It's under family. 
[02:59:00]  It's like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  I like the Pirates of the Caribbean.  They make a lot of money, dude.  Hey, uh, what's Miss Call?  One Miss Call.  Big grand total of zero.  Zero.  I think that's the only zero in history, right?  And wait a minute.  53 reviews.  53 reviewers across America said this movie blows.  Wow.  Is that the lowest rated?  A zero?  It has to.  Well, yeah.  It's the lowest rating.  I know...  But I don't think other movies have gotten a zero.  That could be the first movie that went zero, huh?  Not one person has enjoyed.  No, uh... 
[02:59:30]  So National Treasure 2 is in fourth place.  Wow.  Who wants to guess the top movie of the three things?  I do, Opie.  All right.  Um, uh...  What's your name, sir?  I'm Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Isn't your name...  Oh, yeah.  Eee.  Eee.  Eee.  What did they, uh...  What movies came out?  Let me think.  I say I Am Legend is number one.  No.  I Am Legend.  It's been out a while.  One, two, three, four, five, six place.  Eight point one mil.  Okay.  I'm gonna see it on that big giant screen.  Whatever it's called. 
[03:00:00]  The real big one.  Young action.  Yeah.  I'm going with that.  Sweeney Todd.  No.  Sweeney Todd.  Didn't even make top ten, it looks like.  No top ten for the Sweeney Todd.  It's not that part.  Oh, one missed call, because we mentioned that.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Seventh place.  The Will Fowl movie.  There's no Will.  Such a dick.  Got you that time.  I was ready to look.  Wait, Will Ferrell movie.  Will Ferrell.  Anybody else?  There's not a cartoon out right now.  Pirate something.  Oh, the vegetables one. 
[03:00:30]  The pirates who.  No, that's religious.  There's a movie called The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.  What's that about?  Is that a veggie thing?  Really?  It's religious.  What?  What?  That veggie series that they made a movie about, but it's also on videos and stuff for kids.  It's got all kinds of religious undertones to it.  Really?  Yeah.  They try to.  A lot of God lessons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like fucking, you know, Davy and Goliath. 
[03:01:00]  When you're watching Davy and Goliath as a kid, you never really got into the whole religion  part, but you're always like, wait, God always comes up in this shit.  You know, the father always go, that's God's way, Davy.  Oh, gee, Dad, you know, why did that happen?  God has a plan for us, Davy.  And you're like, yeah, you don't pay attention to that.  But all the rest of the show, they kind of hooked you in.  It's like, oh, look, a puppet, the talking dog, the whole thing.  Sally. 
[03:01:30]  Sally with the yodels on the side of her head.  She had the yodel hairdo.  And the father with the jeep where his head stuck out higher than the roll bar.  Goliath with his fucking oven mitts.  So when he fucked Sally, he wouldn't scratch up her sides.  When Davy would grab his fucking, his God-inspired pink Goliath dog dick.  Fucking stroking it to Sally's face.  Don't do it, Davy.  Well, so that's the pirates who don't do anything? 
[03:02:00]  Came in ninth place.  Atonement, tenth place.  P.S. I love you.  Anyone seen these movies?  Eighth place.  Yeah, back.  Alvin and the Chipmunks is still doing well.  Fifth place.  Wow, really?  There's another kid's cartoon out.  Fuck it.  It's a, it's a, I think it's a, it's a cartoon.  Is it the orphanage?  No, it's that cartoon.  Oh, right, right.  Wait, they're saying it's Veggie Tales is the name of that movie? 
[03:02:30]  It's of the Veggie Tales series.  Oh, all right.  Oh, boy.  This is gonna...  Come on, Jim.  It's the cartoon that's out.  It's a children's cartoon.  It's called A Tumor for Sven.  Oh, Jimmy.  Third place is Juno.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw it.  I liked it.  It was all right.  First Sunday was in second place. 
[03:03:00]  That got horrible reviews.  It was Tracy Morgan and Ice Cube.  Oh, yeah.  Real bad.  It got really bad.  Why did Tracy Morgan blow us off this time around?  What's up with that?  These people are weird, man.  They said...  Roland!  Uh-oh.  They're like, they're like good friends of the show, and then all of a sudden they blow  us off when it comes to the biggies.  That's how Roland walked over from CBS to here.  Yeah, he doesn't...  Just like that.  Yes, no.  What?  He doesn't believe in winter coats.  He's fucking cold out.  He doesn't believe in winter coats.  Nope. 
[03:03:30]  Just t-shirts for a ride.  Not only he doesn't believe in winter coats, he could wear like a fucking hoodie or something.  Long-sleeved shirt, at least.  And you'd still go like, what are you, crazy?  But he wears short-sleeved shirts outside.  Do you run into walls and feel no pain?  Yeah.  Is that something?  Are your guts like a furnace?  That's what it is.  Old fucking...  He's got that heart disease.  He's molten shits.  And when he's walking out there, he sweats.  Yeah.  This is just really weird.  Something's going on with you there, Roland. 
[03:04:00]  So, Roland, why no Tracy Morgan?  The film company had a schedule and they only...  But Tracy's a friend of the show.  When you just get to him and go, Tracy, hey, what's up?  You guys want to see it?  He missed two days of press because he overslept.  He's going to come back, but not during the movie, though.  Yeah.  No.  Not during the movie, though.  No.  First Sunday, you see it?  Yeah, no.  Why?  Why not?  It's awful.  Did he like No Country for Old Men?  Yeah, but There Will Be Blood is way better.  What movie?  There Will Be Blood.  There Will Be Blood.  They said that pussy can act. 
[03:04:30]  And he's not famous.  Who?  Daniel Day-Lewis.  He does nothing but act.  What's There Will Be Blood?  Well, I'm not saying he's a pussy, but I'm just saying he's...  It's an oil movie.  Yeah, Daniel Day-Lewis.  He's phenomenal.  That fucker can...  God damn, he can act.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Daniel.  He was in My Left Foot, Daniel.  He won Oscar, I think, right?  That was 75 years ago, but he's still...  What's this movie about, and why haven't we seen it yet?  Is it out yet?  It's out.  It's really good.  It came out on something... 
[03:05:00]  And what's it about?  He's like an oil man, and he started out...  He delivers oil?  No, but he's looking for oil, and he found the wells, and how his riches become.  He's a rich guy now, and really paranoid about people.  Yeah.  That's really good.  Action, adventure, intrigue.  He only plays motherfuckers from 1801 to 1306.  Certainly, there's nothing new.  Let me see what the film takes place.  Yeah.  There's nothing new.  But it's really, really good.  When he first started finding out parakeets die in mines before people... 
[03:05:30]  Did you see the number one movie over the weekend?  Which one?  That would be The Bucket List.  Yes.  Ah, damn.  Oh, fuck.  That's right, and I knew that, because...  That didn't get good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  It looks so stupid.  They got average reviews.  Like one of these fucking buddy movies where they're dying.  It is, and they find each other, and then...  Yeah, I'm sure it ends all nice and fucking...  No, no, I mean they die and shit, but I'm sure it ends with them accepting the fact that 
[03:06:00]  it's gonna happen.  They had fun, and fuck you.  It's a weird ending, though.  Well, it's about new experiences, right?  Yeah, it's where Morgan Freeman can't afford it.  Lemon party right before they die?  Yeah, so do they suck each other's dick?  Almost, but it's like...  Does Morgan Freeman finally admit that Jessica Tandy was a cunt, and she would shit her diapers  while they were making the movie in the car, and he hated her?  It was just to leave the back windows open.  Who dies first?  That would be Morgan. 
[03:06:30]  Morgan, and does Jack get all choked up about it?  Yeah, then whatever Morgan asks him to do, he finally does it.  He goes, this is for you, buddy.  And then he does...  What's he do, burn the script?  No.  Fucking Oscar-winning old men, cocksuckers, do a real movie.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  And then what?  His last request...  And then he dies?  His last request is to punch that baby hard enough for her to feel it.  Oh, he meets his daughter, what?  He meets his daughter, and then he reconciles... 
[03:07:00]  That he didn't have time for when he was like...  That's great.  And then they both had little urns they put on top of the mountain, his assistant, and  then they...  Yuck.  Yeah.  Little urns for him and Morgan?  It's like fucking dead, broke-back mountain.  Yeah, but there would be a lot of just like, toss one out.  I can't quit you when he's talking to the radiation.  Oh, shit.  Old pudding head.  That's right.  Hey, Rowan, we're all seeing Cloverfield tomorrow.  I know.  I'm excited to see it. 
[03:07:30]  What's the buzz in this movie?  They're not showing us much.  It's very...  No one really knows what it's about.  Nobody's seen it, really.  I heard...  Can I tell you what I heard?  Or is that really bad?  Might be bad.  You know what I'm going to say?  Let's see it first and see if it was accurate.  All right.  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't blow it up.  I'm hearing...  Ah, whatever.  It's black people?  Patrice, they are killing you on his feedback with the eating today, but I just want to  let you know.  Fuck them.  That's not me, though.  It was before.  Oh. 
[03:08:00]  That's Patrice.  Jimmy eating pretzels, too.  Patrice is sipping, and me.  Jimmy's eating pretzels.  So Cloverfield, what do you think?  Is it going to be good, bad, indifferent?  What do you say?  What are you hearing?  What are you hearing?  We're going to have, what?  Abrams on?  Yeah, he's going to call either Friday or Monday.  What if we see the movie tomorrow?  Jimmy and I were discussing this over at XM.  Coming over to XM.  A lot of us are seeing the movie tomorrow, and what if we just fucking hate it? 
[03:08:30]  Then what happens?  Oh, boy.  Well, they've got to be smart enough to give us a screening of a movie they're pretty confident  it's going to do well.  Yeah, well, everybody is...  We didn't get a special screening for One Missed Call, obviously, which is just a bomb.  Yeah.  No, they're confident with the movie it's going to be...  There's really nothing of...  I mean, this week is 27 Dresses and Cloverfield.  That's pretty much it.  All right.  I think I'll be good, though. 
[03:09:00]  What's Cloverfield supposed to be this big mystery surrounding it?  Yeah, you don't know what the hell the monster is.  Is it a monster?  What's going on?  It's got to be a monster.  The head of the frigging Statue of Liberty goes flying down the street.  What's going to do that?  The Statue of Liberty is a shit.  Always.  I'm so fed up with the Statue of Liberty being raped in every movie.  It's just...  It started with Planet of the Apes.  It had to start before.  It always...  And it's the end of the world.  It ain't even just the end of America.  The Statue of Liberty represents, you know, with her dress up, her pussy showing, somebody's 
[03:09:30]  spitting a fucking...  Just fat lips.  Big fat green lips.  Her book is all fucking floating away and her crown is all...  It is always the symbol of, like, everything's fucked.  It's the Statue of Liberty.  But what is this movie?  Is it...  What's the genre?  Is it a horror film?  It's kind of like a suspense action movie.  But it's also like a Blair Witch kind of a thing because it's done with, like, other...  With people that are involved during the story. 
[03:10:00]  Handheld, cell phone cam kind of look.  So you're supposed to be, like...  Yeah, they're documenting their last...  Involved.  Yeah, they're documenting kind of what's going on with...  Kind of Blair Witch project.  Cam quarters and...  Yeah.  I think that's pretty cool, though.  I mean, hopefully it'll be done right.  Sounds like a cool idea.  I hope it's good.  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.  And they're doing all that viral marketing.  Ooh, that's really hot these days.  It is.  I heard they opened the Statue of Liberty's book and there's just, like, pictures of  things in it and they realized she was a retard.  It was a Dr. Seuss book. 
[03:10:30]  All the dicks she fucked when she was in France.  All the dicks she sucked when she was in France.  Before she got here.  It's a bunch of guys with fucking, like, white wigs and those little brown moles.  They're fucking unclipped fucking scurvy dicks.  1720.  With their wood teeth.  Yeah, wooden teeth and scurvy dicks.  Spike marks on their stomach from getting blowjobs from us.  With their shiny moles that they powder up nice before they go out.  Unshaven iron pussy. 
[03:11:00]  Hey, Roland.  Did you like Juno?  I love Juno.  Juno was good, right?  Mm-hmm.  Soundtrack was pretty interesting.  Yeah, it's good.  Want to play Superstar today?  An old Carpenter's song that...  Who did it in the movie?  What?  Oh, uh...  Sonic Youth?  Yeah, Sonic Youth.  See if you got Sonic Youth doing Superstar.  We'll do something a little different.  We'll go to break with that song.  Let's say hi to Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I'm just calling because I went and saw Juno based on your recommendation. 
[03:11:30]  And that scene you were talking about, about all babies want to be born.  I totally agree with you.  You guys should be able to say that shit on the radio.  Just say thank you and hang up.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks, man.  Oh, the Asian that was protesting outside the abortion clinic.  And she was protesting in broken English because she's Asian.  Exactly, exactly.  It's okay if you do it in movies, but on a radio show, it's not, for whatever reason.  Okay, now I know what you're talking about.  Yep.  The scene was hilarious, but if you guys had said on the radio, you guys would have been 
[03:12:00]  picketed and thrown off.  It was ridiculous.  We'd have been in Dutch.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  All right, later.  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  Large, big, huge from Kentucky writes, the Statue of Liberty is a size queen.  She sits right down on the Empire State Building.  She would only fuck, like, warlords from Africa.  The French dicks did nothing for her.  She's a big grass skirt cock.  She takes the Empire State Building right down to the sidewalk. 
[03:12:30]  Right down to the old sidewalk.  Oh, my God.  That's some cold shit right there.  Oh, that's almost...  She takes it all the way.  She's so bummed because she looks toward the Twin Towers, and they're not there anymore.  She was taking both those towers in both holes.  No problem.  Right down to the sidewalk.  She wants the Freedom Tower for the shitter.  Right. 
[03:13:00]  Right to the sidewalk.  All right.  Do you want to hear a creepy version of Superstar?  You would know the song.  I think the Carpenters did it originally.  Did we got the original?  Play me a little taste of the original.  This is one of...  A little taste.  That's funny.  You say that with the Carpenters.  Yeah, really.  She didn't taste much of anything except her own vomit.  Nothing?  Died of anorexia?  No?  Karen Carpenter.  Oh, God.  Karen Carpenter.  I'm making Karen Carpenter puke jokes. 
[03:13:30]  I thought I'd get a little laugh.  Fuck.  Here's the original.  It's a laugh-free zone today.  Everyone's fucking bombing us.  Jesus Christ.  Everyone's just bombing.  Holy shit, but no one should be.  Pilot to bombardier.  That's what's bothering me.  It's like, that's pretty funny.  I think that reference, it was so...  It was way beyond...  Well, the only reason I brought it up was because, you know, we're going to play some Carpenters.  I just didn't get it.  That's all my own problem.  I did not get it.  But now that I do get it, I would have laughed. 
[03:14:00]  I do.  I understand.  Than would have laughed at that one.  Of course he would have.  It's a suck up.  Michael Savage, send tickets.  Yes.  Blue Line, Islanders Flyers in Philly.  Yes, I'm there.  Michael Savage, the radio guy?  I don't know.  I love him.  I saw a trailer for a Western last night and I was thinking, Than would be perfect for  a Western these days.  Didn't require acting.  Like you...  Oh, shit.  Well, we'll never know because of this program.  Oh, wow.  Steve Quick, Steve Quick text. 
[03:14:30]  Just make sure he doesn't insult the staff.  He's being insolent again.  Yes, he's being insolent.  By the way...  You go to the last comic stand, did you?  Uh, no.  Why?  Why?  I didn't know about it.  I want to take bearded comics.  Hey, you should.  Maybe you should have done a commercial.  All right, listen.  Pretending to rap.  It wasn't...  Listen to me.  You know what?  You saw Dave just got fired.  That's why Don was in town today.  What happened?  I don't know what that's about, but he just got fired.  Um... 
[03:15:00]  Because he smashed Fez's face into a pizza.  Trying to find out more info, but that's all I know so far.  Did he really...  Are you joking?  No.  He's gone.  That's why Don was up today.  You just never know on their show what's real or what's a fucking work.  That's what's amazing about their show.  Sometimes you're just like, this is all fake.  Like the whole fucking Dave getting married thing.  Right.  I thought was a wash up until I fucking was there.  Watching it.  And they got married. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  I'm sorry to interrupt, Jan.  Did he hurt Fez?  I heard the end of the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Fez left.  Was it just...  Because Fez is a very sensitive guy, but did he physically hurt him?  I think he did.  Like he hurt his eye.  It was like slave boy week or something.  And Ronnie didn't think the bit was working.  So I guess they were trying a little harder to make something work.  And he had a collar on.  He was treating him like a dog.  And he made him like sniff a pizza that was on the floor.  And while he was doing it, Dave took the back of Fez's head and smashed it into the pizza. 
[03:16:00]  But you know, it's a fucking floor.  How much give does a pizza have?  Right.  So he like hit his eye.  And then he just got up.  Like a slip or something.  And ran the fuck out of here, I'm sure in tears, into the rain.  He had a few things to say before he left.  Did he?  Had a little breakdown.  I didn't hear that.  I was actually listening.  Dude, I didn't hear that.  I missed the...  I turned on the fucking end of Ron and Fez.  And I hear something going on.  Like where Ron was scolding Dave.  And, you know, HR got involved.  And Don was up here. 
[03:16:30]  I was wondering why.  And that's it.  I thought they had reviews.  That's it.  So we'll try to find out more.  Oh, of course.  Also.  Oh, he's got a baby on the way and everything.  They fired Dave?  Jesus.  Was he fucking up?  I don't know anything about the show.  Everybody on that show except Ron Bennington fucks up.  That's pretty much what I've gotten from the show.  Ron's a rock.  Ron is a rock.  That was the final straw, I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, maybe he messed up.  I don't know.  The other thing that was suggested by a listener, I think it's a great idea. 
[03:17:00]  Anthony was ranting and raving, losing his mind with this whole gambling thing with the  cowboy hat guy from earlier.  Cowboy hat guy.  And someone suggested that me, Ant, Jimmy, and maybe Patrice, a few other guys, we play  a little blackjack.  And we play the way you want to play.  I'll wipe the fucking floor with you.  Oh, Christ.  And see if Anthony's, if his theory's right or not.  But it'll affect me.  So you won't be able to get an accurate depiction of me playing blackjack because you guys playing 
[03:17:30]  like shit will affect me.  Where's the cards?  I don't know.  I'll fucking maul everybody.  We need a dealer.  We need chips.  Get her to deal.  All right.  So we're going to, but let's, we got to play for, uh, you know, wink, wink, fake money.  Fake money.  Wink, wink.  Let's play right now.  No gambling on the air, huh?  What?  Not a lot of, really gambling.  We'll play for fake money.  I'll fucking wipe everybody up.  We'll play for fake money.  Keep it all, uh, whatever.  All right.  So anyway, uh, Juno.  So here, there's a lot going on.  So the Carpenters, uh, sang this originally. 
[03:18:00]  You might recognize this song.  Here it is.  Just a, just a piece.  I remember this.  Damn, this is fat bitch gets sick.  Fat bitch.  Uh, get to the chorus.  Then we'll all know it.  Jimmy, I'm going to turn you on to another song today that you'll have on your, your iPod 
[03:18:30]  by the end of the day.  This is great.  Well, this, the original's good, but wait till you hear what Sonic Youth did.  I've never heard this.  It's nice.  She did have a very good voice.  She sure did.  There was no food going down there to fuck anything up.  No.  Just water and whole fucking.  The vomit cleansed the vocal cords.  Yeah, the fucking, the acid, the brown back of the teeth from the fucking stomach bile.  Here's the hook.  Fucking awful breath.  Nice horns from the 70s. 
[03:19:00]  Exactly.  Had to have horns in the 70s, right?  Wow.  That's the wind going through her ears.  All right.  That's good enough.  So that's, uh, so that's the original on the Juno soundtrack.  Walking trombone.  She's staying with her face in the toilet.  That's why she has that nice echo.  Those are fucking lyrics bouncing off the water before puke comes out.  Fucking.  Like her hearty meal of a carrot stick. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I'm going to treat myself.  I'm going to have a garbanzo bean.  Garbanzo.  A microphone shaped like an index finger.  To do the run, run, run.  Blah.  So the soundtrack, which is.  Oh, smelly knuckles.  Which is, uh.  Which is.  Jesus. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, smelly knuckles.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  So the soundtrack, which is interesting.  Getting a little buzz right there, rolling the soundtrack.  Yeah.  It's not for everybody, though.  It's a little.  It's a little.  It's a little.  It's a little indie.  It's a little indie, a little wimpy.  But they have this song on there.  Same song you just heard done by Sonic Youth.  Listen to the difference in the song.  Oh, creepy. 
[03:20:30]  I don't know.  He sounds like she felt.  I fell in love with you.  Sounds like a serial killer singing a song, right?  Yeah.  How cool is this, though?  Oh, this is Juno.  Off the Juno soundtrack.  I think they did this years ago, to be honest with you.  I'm not discovering anything new, but it's new to me. 
[03:21:00]  You guys saw my musical youth pass the duchy?  That's a good one.  The hook is coming up.  Listen to this.  It's just the radio.  Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby?  You said you'd be coming back this way, yeah, baby.  Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby. 
[03:21:30]  I love you.  I really do.  Isn't that wild?  I will say, though, I enjoyed the version by Miss Pakasur today.  I enjoyed her version a little bit better.  That fucking song was stuck.  Pakasur.  You didn't like the original, though?  You all right? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  The original, right?  The original was better.  I agree.  I like the original.  Yeah.  What, you like the original song?  I did, yeah.  It was nice, man.  What was their big hit?  Sonic Youth?  The Carpenters.  Oh, shit.  They had a fuckload, right?  They would have beat those, man.  Rainy Days of Monday.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't think of one of their songs.  Oh, they must have had ten.  What was their number one fucking...  Ten, I bet you they had ten songs that you know every word.  Easily.  Easily, too.  Yeah.  Really?  Let's go to Minnesota real fast.  Mark, go ahead. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, you know where you guys know that tune from?  What?  Did you want...  Tommy Boy.  Remember when they're driving in the car and they're both falling their eyes off?  Oh, right.  And they were just singing at the top of her lungs.  When did she die?  And the remake sounds like it belongs in Silence of the Land.  I would say 80...  Yeah, absolutely.  82.  So she just rotted away?  I'll say that.  I don't know when.  Van?  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm guessing 1982.  That she died?  Yeah.  I bet she was in the 70s. 
[03:23:00]  I don't think she made it to the 80s, bro.  Yeah, I don't think she did.  Was she just...  Oh, well, years active.  65 to 83.  Wow.  And she died 32 years old in 1983.  Oh, see, I was close.  32.  God almighty.  We got a list of their songs.  You got a picture of her when she was all skinny and shit?  Yeah, it's...  I don't know what she looked like.  It's not good.  I'm sure it's not.  You gotta see it.  Uh...  No. 
[03:23:30]  No.  I'm trying to find...  All right, whatever.  Let's say hi to Bill in Ohio.  Bill.  Yes, sir.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, what's going on, man?  You guys...  Honestly, you guys...  Seriously, I gotta tell you something.  I mean, listen...  I don't laugh at any shit.  I don't laugh at any shit, but I gotta tell you something.  You guys get on the radio.  And you guys get on this thing.  I just turned it on, man.  And I heard you guys talking.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  But I tell you what.

Oh, wait.  You hung up on him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I thought he hung up on him.  I'm sorry, sir.  Thank you.  Rainy Days and Mondays, of course.  Superstar, which you just heard.  Top of the World.  I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation, and the only explanation I can find 
[03:24:30]  is the love that I've found ever since you've been around.  What's she saying?  I'm standing on the top of a pile of mashed potatoes, and not even sinking in.  Right.  Very good, Jimmy.  Well, here's the song, the one we're all trying to remember.  Is this it?  No, no, no, no.  Close to you.  Oh, right.  That's the big Carpenter's song.  Close to you.  I think this was the one that...  Can we hear it?  Yeah.  Let's hear a little bit of that.  Who is she singing it to?  A feather? 
[03:25:00]  The Grim Reaper.  This is the one, I think, that...  I've heard this.  This is the biggie.  This is the biggie.  Are we fucking discussing the Carpenters on a shock talk radio show?  You have vultures.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  Oh, that's funny. 
[03:25:30]  32.  Man, that's sad.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Ew.  Oh, she looks really fat on the right.  She looks really fat.  Oh, what do we got here?  Before and after?  Oh, come on.  No way.  That's stretched.  What a puppet face.  After, was it?  After looks like she opened the lost heart.  Fucking face was melting there. 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  Oh, big teeth.  How you doing?  Getting a coffin.  That's what she looks like.  Go fuck yourself.  Fucking.  It's fucking George.  With a big wig on.  Suck that cock.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Can you please turn that up?
